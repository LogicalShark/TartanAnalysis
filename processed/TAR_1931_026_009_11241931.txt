 S. M. E. Studies 
Forces On Bearings
Professor Trinks Is Hejd 
Of Research 
Committee
A committee of the American 
Socicty of Mechanical Engineers, 
under the chairmanship of Prof. 
Trinks, has recently completed the, 
first division of a study concerned 
with the use of anti-friction bear
ings on roll necks of rolling mills. 
The research, which is under the 
direction of J. H. Hitchcock, 'Re
search Associate of'the A. S. M. E., 
was begun in January, 1930, for the 
purpose of providing manufacturers 
of bearings and rolling mill's with 
reliable data on which to base their 
designs. The study is being sup
ported by contributions of,the in1-, 
tercstcd companies. The first prob
lem was the study of forces which 
occur during ' rolling, knd the rela
tion between these forces and the 
factors which' influence them. This 
study has been carried on to the 
extent that forces cannow be prc' dieted with a great deal of accuracy 
in nearly every rolling mill oper
ation.
Following the study of forces,
. research was begun on the strength 
of' roll necks. For this purpose, 
-models of actual rolls were con
structed of plaster of Paris. Plaster 
of Paris was used because1 it has 
been found that the results obtained 
when it is subjected to stress-close
ly approximate those obtained when 
steel is used.,.. Many different de
signs were used in making the

Co-eds Charms Of 
ChiselingNo Avail In 
For Higher Grades
The commonly accepted idea that 
college' girls, through their charms, 
seek higher marks than the}' deserve,' 
has been shattered. A survey com
pleted by the New York University 
Daily News revealed that, in the 
opinion of the universitys professors, 
college . girls do less chiseling for 
high grades than do the collegc 
men.
Dr. William D. Glenn, liqad of-the 
universitys Washington Square Col
lege Department of Pscliplogy, de
clared: Professors can be divided
among three groups. when marks arc 
being considered.
There is the first group that offers 
tests to the students, and thus gives 
them their true marks. 1'hcn there 
is the second group consisting of
Welfare Drive
Those students who wish 
to contribute to the Wel
fare Fund and have not been 
seen by their department 
workers -or who may find it 
more convenient to contribute 
after Thanksgiving may do 
so at the Y office after the 
holiday recess period.
professors who are prey to the ways 
of the wily women and so give out 
marks much higher than desenved "by 
the fair coeds.
Finally, the third group consists 
of professors who understand wom
anly ways and just lean back listen
ing intently to what the woman stu
dent has to say. They usually mark 
the. coed lower than she deserves so 
that theywill not appear prejudiced. 
Professor Homer A. Watt, head of 
the English department of tht Wash
ington Square College, said that al
though girls sometimes seek higher 
marks than they deserve through 
their charms, they meet with very 
little success.
****** 
Women at Carnegie may do Jess 
^chiseling than the males, but 
what they do must be very effec
tive. A glimpse at the scholar
ship averages for the various dor
mitories and fraternities will show 
the lowest sorority average is twotenths above than of the highest 
fraternity. No fratcrni.ty surpassed 
the 4.G0 mark, whereas four sorori
ties were above this. It cannot 
be definitely ^stated that co-eds at 
Carnegie resort to chiseling to 
get higher grades, but it will be 
conceded that they do have a, 
goodly number of male instructors.

Emil Ludwig Decides To Give Son
Benefits Of An American Education
(Syracuse Daily Orange)
In order to show his deep re
spect and approval of the American 
college, . Emil Ludwig, well known 
German author, has determined to 
send his son to an American col
lege. This inference was brought 
out in one of his articles recently 
published in the American Maga
zine.
His first basis for this announce
ment was based on his observation 
of the American college where 
learning is a cheerful and happy 
thing. Class hours are much 
shorter and interspersed with var
ious periods of recreation and rest. 
He also pointed out the advantage 
of studying in an atmosphere where 
.modern thought and surroundings 
are always prevalent. His main 
objection to the advanced educa
tional system of Germany seemed 
to be his opposition to the placing 
of contemporary ideas in a back
ground of medieval structures and 
age-old traditions.
Mr. Ludwig has also been im
pressed by the close association of 
student and teacher in the Amer
ican college which tends toward a 
greater interest in the students 
educational pursuits. Because of 
this easy comradeship, there has 
arisen between teacher and pupil 
a cordial affection and mutual con
fidence. I believe that the Amer
ican teacher, partaking as he does
of play and sport with his pupils, 
is just the man to whom those 
pupils turn for advice, states Mr. 
Ludwig.
Continuing his stafed advantages 
in the American college, Mr. Lud
wig declares that The second rea
son why I shall do my best to send 
my spn across the ocean'to study 
is the competitive system, which 
is much stronger in America , than 
in Germany. He explains this as 
the best means for an individual to 
give his utmost of effort and abil
ity to prove himself as among the 
foremost in prowess.
Mr. Ludwig states his third rea
son as being the great variety of 
races which come  togchcr in 
friendly communion in this country.

Fred W. Latham Chosen 
Societys President 
By Re-election
The Carnegie Mechanical Engiiii 
coring Socicty will hold its regular, 
meeting today at 2:30 in Room 10,; 
Machinery Hall. Dr. M. M\ Frochtj 
will speak on Phpto-Elasticity: Its/ 
Measuring and Application. 1-3is? 
talk will be illustrated with slidesi 
showing some results of his work.
Dr. Frocht spent last year at the: 
University of Michigan, ^Vhere, by} 
using new methods and new equip
ment, greater accuracy, was obi 
taincd in the measurement of stress., 
The use of-bakclitc models, a'n-i 
nealcd by a process developed by, 
Dr. Frocht, instead of celluloid 
models, and the substitution o 
monochromatic light for white, light 
make it possible to avoid difficulties 
due to optical creep and to obtain 
clear statical photographs of stress 
patterns. This new method per
mits the use of kincmatography 
thereby opening up new fields for 
the study - of import stresses and 
other important engineering prob
lems. *
At the last meeting a presidential" 
re-election was held. Fred W. 
Latham . was elected as the new# 
president.

of Duquesne and Carnegie to meet 
at a social affair before the Duquesne-Carncgie charity football game, 
the proceeds of which will go toward 
unemployment relief, which will he 
played on Saturday, December 5. 
Inasmuch as this game will be the 
first time the two schools have met

student spirit among the students 
of both institutions.

Three Skibos Tie For First Burke Breaks Record As Plebes Lose
Armentrout, Sample, Heinzer, OToole Return To Lineup
A fighting Carnegie cross-country 
team last Friday rose to that height 
which every good team reaches oiicc 
a season and soundly trounced the 
strong Pittaggregation by the de
cisive score o 20-35. This was the 
worst beating a Pitt cross-country 
team has ever received at the hands 
of Carnegie Tech, and it marks the 
high spot of an already successful 
hill and dale season. Captain Jess 
Price, Wilbur Ramsey and Bob Schell 
romped across the finish line to
gether, a comfortable distance ahead 
of Watkins, the first Pitt man. 
Shorry Allen, Skibo sophomore star, 
put on a stirring finish t0 nose out 
Clisc, Panther first ranking runner, 
for fifth, place. Big Bill Burns proved 
conclusively; . that his - porformancc 
against West Virginia was no fluke 
by placing ninth. Jess Price demon
strated what a grcrt captain he is 
by sacrificing individual honors to 
hang back with his teammates and 
thereby insure victory. The following 
happy harriers will leave for New 
York Tuesday night: Price, Ramsey, 
Schcll, Allen, Burns, Sord, Stankcy 
and Neff. Coach Guy Halfcrty and. 
Manager Bill Gelling,  will accom
pany the team.
The plebs were not so fortunate 
as the varsity, losing to the Pitt 
frosh by the Same score, 20-35.
Individual honors, however, went 
to the Tartans as Burke,, plcbe cap
tain, hung tenaciously to the Pitt 
star throughout the race and then 
beat him out at the finish, to estab
lish a, new course record of 14:36.- 
This supplants the old mark of14-31% made in 1924 by Gus Moore, 
former Pitt star. Burke, along with 
the other plcbe runners, concluded a 
banner year, last Fridays defeat 
being their only loss in five starts. 
Plcbe harriers who won the coveted 
1935 arc Burke, Kulas, Blair, N.clT,. 
Hoffman and Adams.
The results of the Varsity meet:
1. Price, Carnegie, 29:35.

\ The New Yorkers version of a football team
indtictes a super-charged offense with a line 
that has demonstrated its ability to hold things 
under control when necessary. To date they 
.AV have lost but one game, this occasion being
a lucky break for Georgia. A scoreless tie is 
- on j.jle books for the Fordham-N.Y.U. game,
and it so happened that the Violets outplayed their local oppon
ents as they have done in all games this season. The Chick 
Meehanmen who arc expected to bear the brunt of the attack 
are Joe LaMark, Jim Temple, Tanguay, Grossman and Marchi.

another of these affairs.
VIOLETS FAVOREDCLAN NEWSCarnegie Tech is not invading Nfew 
Yoi-k in a body this Thanksgiving, 
but it docs seem that every third 
person on the campus is claiming 
that he will be right there in the 
Yankee Stadium when game time 
rolls around. Student tickets for the 
game may be procured Wednesday 
at the graduate managers office.
The New York U. battle has be
come an almost traditional battle, 
and for a number of years the Vio
lets have had a jinx , over the Tar
tan forces. Only in 1929, when the 
Pittsburgh aggregation .stcam-rollerecj 
the New Yorkers by a 20-0 score, 
have the Skibos been victors, The 
Empire Staters will likewise be re
membered as the thorn in the side 
of  that great Steffen machine of 
1928.
The Meehanmen -have had an inand-out season. Rolling up 180 points 
in their first fotir games, they were 
looked upon as the potential leaders 
of Eastern football;- this fall, but 
late in the season tlicy have Suf
fered two humiliating - reverses and

had been beaten 53-0 liy Southern 
California and tied by the same 
North Dakota team that fell before 
the Duciucsnc team Saturday, was 
given little chance, against the great 
Violet hosts, but they defeated the 
Manhattan team 14-6, outplaying theeasterners throughout thegame. 
Nothing but the excellent punting 
of Bob McNamara kept the game 
from being a rout. Georgia also 
look the measure of Chic Meehans 
crew, 7-6, but N. Y. U. looked like 
the better team for 59 minutes of 
the game. Motts 98-yard run for a 
touchdown and Smith's conversion of 
the extra point won the game for 
the southerners. Fordham, undejfeated this  season, tied theViolets, 
,0-0, two weeks ago.'
, On the other hand the Violet and 
White has' rolled up impressive scores 
on formidable Eastern elevens. West'

Alumni Urged To Give A 
Dollar Or More To 
Campaign
Today is Dollar Day. To alumni 
that means the opening of the an
nual drive for the Carnegie .Endow
ment Fund. The campaign will last1 
from November 24 until December 
31 during which time Carnegiegraduates are'urged to contribute a 
dollar or more to the fund.
Under the Endowment Fund Plan 
Carnegie must raise four milliondollars by 1946. At this time the 
Carnegie Corporation has agreed to 
double the principle, plus the iptercst. Thus a single dollar turned in 
this year will amount to over, five 
dollars  in , 1946 providing . thefour, 
millions can be raised. '
The Dollar Day plan was origin
ated by John L. Porter, chairman of 
the school committee of Carnegie, 
and has been in operation five years. 
The campaign. is  not limited to* 
alumni only and contributions can 
be made at any time during, the 
year and still be accredited to the 
Dollar Dy Fund. Cheeks should 
be made payable, to. the Alumni 
Federation and sent to th alumni 
office.
THE USUAL ARRAY OF SKIBO LUMINARIES will takd the field on turkey day with the-possible exception of Clyde 
Heinzer who still feels the effects of a sore knee. With a week of rest to their credit, the remainder of the team should be in fair physical shape to make the final stand for another major 
victory this -season.Forbes National Bank

COACH HALFERTYS HARRIERS romped over the 
Schenley Park course to their third victory this season out of 
the four meets. A long desired, and well deserved decision was 
taken from the Pitt representatives with a 120 to 35 score. Cap
tain Price, Ramsey, and Schell took the honors for the day when 
they tripped across the finish line, hand-in-hand.
A party of ten will make the trip to New York for the an
nual run over Van Courtland course with the Violet aggrega
tion tomoorow. A victory for the Plaid team at this stage 
would end the best season ever enjoyed by the Harriers.
Although the Plebes lost to the Panther frosh, the most 
brilliant performance was turned in by a Tartan runner. Burke, 
Plcbe captain, was extended for ,thc first tirtic by the Pitt star 
and in doing so, registered a new course record that lowers the 
former one by one and two-fifths of a second.

Yes, I have been solicited for one 
of those permits to attend the 
Thanksgiving Recess Dance on No
vember 27, and 11 have purchased a 
ticket and will attend the affair. I 
know of no better way of enjoying 
a holiday than attending one of 
these night dances. They sure are 
the best ever, and think, only $1 for 
admittance. If they charged $2 you; 
would still be getting your moneys 
worth. So you will be seeing me. 
pt the hop.
Yon knosUy I dont want to be a 
growler, but it is exasperating when 
you think"' how little other people 
think of some peoplewhat I am 
driving at is those pesky people who 
dont consider the .other fellow. Now 
I am an idle night student and dont 
want to work, but I cant help 
noticing the way some of those in
dustrious ones come out of class at 
change periods making so much noise 
that one can hardly hear himself 
think. They never think whether 
there is a class in .session in the next 
room; they are bent on discussing 
the only problem which stuck them, 
or the only sentence they lidd wrong 
on the paper, etc. I have no doubt 
that they are right, but then there 
are others in other class-rooms who 
have other problems such as listening 
to lectures, reciting an assignment, 
or *answering questions, and the noise 
which is going on in the corridor is 
enough to distract a habitual con
centrator, if there arc any such, but 
when it comcs to yours truly I am 
outside with the noisemakcrs. So
have a heart and lets be quiet in 
going to our other class-rooms dur
ing periods so as not to disturb 
other classes 'which arc in session.
Didja Notice certainly better look 
out f6r me if lie wants a fight or a 
word battle. Yes, Ill choose my
weapons, and' they wont be wooden 
swords either. None of that make
shift that the stage uses to fool the 
public. We will go to it in real

CAMELS are never parched or toasted!
JL OLKS who smoke really fresh cigarettes made 
from choice sun-ripened tobaccos never have to 
give a thought to their throats.
Thats because such fresh cigarettes retain natural 
moisture and are gratefully smooth, cool, throatfriendly, mild.
Camels are the fresh cigarette  everyone knows 
that nowtheyre blended from the finest Turkish 
and mild Domestic tobaccos that money and skill 
can buy.
We would never dream of parching or toasting
these choice sun-ripened tobaccosthat would only 
drive off or destroy the natural moisture that makes 
Camels fresh in natures own mild way.
The Camel Humidor Pack protects a fine cigarette 
fresh with natural moisture  it could do little or 
nothing to freshen a cigarette that is dried-out or 
factory-stale.
If you smoke for pleasure, see for yourself what 
freshness means in mildness and flavor switch to 
Camels for just one daythen leave them, if you can!

Whos Who
Willi the debut of tlie new directory the num
ber of telephone calls to certain girls -from 
strangers has rcached an appalling figure. A 
.statistician glanced over the book and emerged 
with solnc interesting material. In our midst we 
have 'Diamond Lil in life 'flesh. Not only that but 
a Brower, a (lift, a dc Havre, an Anna Hilly, a 
Hodkey, a Batty, a Dice, a Huff, ".'a Hotnam, 
Looney and Mooney, . Speed,. Lightfoot, Thistle 
and Slick.
The; Smith1 Clan heads the list with twenty, 
members present attd are followed by . fifteen 
Davises and Millers, an even , dozen Williams and 
last, but not least one Zubritsky; He finds twentytwo mixed' couples, from the same addresses in
dicating brothers and sisters or else. There are1
iio Dragoifs with names' beginning with letters 
from _t,he last half-of the alphabet. The statistician 
then got hold of a; phone  directory and after, 
finding Ales, Angels, Amcns, Alleys, John 
lists; Biblos, Beers, Birdys, Bogus, Bools and 
Butters in the first few pages immediately -went 
haywire on imagining .the possibilities of the whole 
directory. Hes  coming around' nicely, thank you.* * * *
Among the Gigolos
Fromthe looks -of -some of the' combinations 
at the lrreshman Dancc there were a number of 
blind dates mafic for the affair . . . Djiisy Clarke 
drops a part of her costume in front of the band 
but her partner, recovered the fumble in time to 
save the night .  ,/ Some of' the Freshjncn dug 
a few fancy steps out; of the mothballs and gave
sonic exhibitions that alone Were worth the price

Long Live Regulations!
'rite Margaret Morrison Sophs have been 
making a Big Push during the last few weeks of 
Freshman regulations. More..than one poor Plebc 
has been caught oft guard and as a result got to 
wear one of those outlandish outfits with pig
tails nevcrything. Frannie Hall pleaded an ap
pointment with, a dentist and thus begged off 
trial. On the same afternoon Ellen Bishop and
lil Herman were out scouting for signs of the 
enemy. They run across Frannie "keeping her ap
pointment itr Sclicnlcy Park for which there was 
hell to pay. The Sophomore men gave up bother
ing Freshmen Jong ago so there hav.c been no' 
skirmishes on that front.
University of ChicagoA new
dictionary is being prepared under 
the auspices of the University of 
Chicago, and. in it will, befound 
the language of the street, the 
night club, and the speakeasy. 
Some of the new words arc: Boot
leg, speakeasy, blah, fizzle, whoopee, 
ace, black bottom, deb, awful, 
debunk, blighter, dizzy, finicky, 
Black Maria, and blockhead.
Northwestern UniversityAs an 
added inducement to attend the 
supper dances at the Edgewater 
Beach Hotel, Paul Whiteman, who 
is playing an engagement at that 
hotel, offered a loving cup to the 
best dancers on a certain Friday 
evening which had been designated 
"Fraternity Night. More than 200 
students of Northwestern attended 
the affair.
A number of .foreign delegates 
who attended the third international 
conference on bituminous coal were 
visitors - Friday, November 20, at 
the coal research laboratory of the 
Carnegie -'Institute ; of Technology. 
Other groups, were  taken on in
spection visits to coal mines, clean
ing' plants, and other industrial 
s'hops in the Pittsburgh district.
During the conference the re-, 
search laboratory was visited by 
James A. Farrell and Myron C. 
Taylor, .both officers of. the U.' S. 
Steel Corporation, which contrib
uted towards the organization of 
the . laboratory. Both expressed 
satisfaction'at the manner in which' 
the laboratory is being operated, 
and commended Dr. H. H. Lowry
 on his work in organizing the 
studies. Praise also was given by 
.Prof. R. V. Wheeler of the Uni
versity of Sheffield, .England. Dr. 
Hans Koppcrs of Germany and Dr. 
Hans Tropsch of .the Armour In
stitute, Chicago, and. formerly of 
Czechoslovakia, were .among the 
visitors.
The donations for. the laboratory, 
which /was started in June, 1930, 
came as a sequel to the interna
tional coal conferences.

Such Bands!
The Mens Junior Prom Corhmittce yery.b6ldly announces a list of orchestras under considera
tion that includes a majority of the first run 
orchestras in the country. As long as, they arc 
"considering they might as well ' include Paul 
Whiteman, Wayne King and Rudy Valle for all 
tlic good -it will do them. The prices of the 
orchestras under consideration vary from $2,500 to 
$750 and the end of the world will occur on the 
day following the Student Councils sanctioning 
of such extravagencc in orchestras. Of course an 
orchestra of the caliber mentioned above wojild 
be very nice and all that but why talk'about sucli 
improbabilities and why get students excited by
squeaks and plays in the waste
basket . . Say, how about these
