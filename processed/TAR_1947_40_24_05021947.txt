Sigma Nu Installs 
New Chapter
Members of Sigma Nu travelled 
to Westminster College to install 
the 100th chapter of the fraternity 
last Saturday. Over 150 active 
and alumni members of Kappa 
Phi Lambda, one of the oldest lo
cal fraternities in the country, 
were initiated and the group was 
installed as the Epsilon Psi chap
ter of the Sigma Nu fraternity.
It was a great honor for the 
CIT chapter to be chosen from 
the numerous chapters located in 
this section of the country to ini
tiate and install the new members 
of Sigma Nu. In attendance at 
the ceremonies were all of the 
national officers of Sigma Nu, in 
addition to representatives from 
every chapter in the eastern sec
tion of the country.

at the Syria Mosque on May 1, 
playing George Gershwins Rhap
sody in Blue with the 55-piece 
group of musicians, chorus, and 
soloists under the direction of 
Paul Whiteman.
Mr. Wild, a former music stu
dent here, has been acclaimed one 
of the greatest pianists to emanate 
from Pittsburgh since Oscar Le
vant. Since his discharge from 
the Navy, he has appeared as so
loist with Cities Service, the 
Philco hour with Paul Whiteman, 
and the General Motors hour.

You may have noticed that some

beauty, and in passing you prob
ably commented on the severity 
of the housing shortage. But we,

Spring Carnival Opens; 
Many Events Scheduled
Carnegie Techs glorious Spring 
Carnival broke in full splendor 
last night with the opening of the 
gay, multicolored midway and the 
final performance of Scotch and 
Soda Clubs hit musical Rock n 
Riot.
The celebration continued to
day with an attractive parade of 
floats, the preliminary running of 
the sweepstakes, the calling of 
members to honoraries, and the 
coronation of the campus queen.
It will be Swing and Sway 
with Sammy Kaye tonight in the 
informal atmosphere of the ren

Famous Writer 
Aids New Authors
Any prospective authors on 
campus? If so, CIT has a superb 
course to further their ambitions.
Miss Gladys Schmitt, professor 
of English in Fine Arts and noted 
author, (Gates of Aulis, David the 
King), conducts this unusual cre
ative writing class.
The aim of the courseproper 
style and technique in popular 
writingis not unusual, but the 
class attitude and instruction 
methods would be nothing short 
of sacrilegious in musty engineer
ing classrooms. Informality is not 
only the exception, but the rule, 
and to the extent that the stu
dents enjoy the class immensely.
If any name could be given to 
the instruction method, it would 
be the conference system. Each 
of the class members submits an 
outline of a proposed project to 
Miss Schmitt at the beginning of 
the semester. Any type of wiiting 
may be attempted. At the pres
ent, poetry, novels, novellas (short 
novels), short stories, a long es
say, and a journal are being writ
ten.
After the outline is checked the 
student works the rest of the 
semester on his project, which de
termines his entire gradeno 
quizzes, no tests, no written re
ports. Writing is done entirely 
outside of class, and consequently 
Miss Schmitt is continually haunt
ed by her novice authors, perpetu[Continued on Page 5]
the march of the champions will 
precede the carnival acts and pre
sentation of awards scheduled for 
the midway in the afternoon.
Johnny Long will provide the 
background for the formal dance 
tomorrow night as a climax to 
the three day holiday.
The queen will be crowned this 
afternoon by Les Stanford who 
will put on the robes of the Arch
bishop of Carnival for the occasioin. The queen, attended by her 
court of six, all in white, will re
ceive the regal honors and then 
as her first majestic act call the 
new members of the campus hon
oraries.
The honoraries to call are Om
icron Delta Kappa, senior men ac
tivities; Pi Delta Epsilon, jour
nalism; Tau Beta Pi, engineering 
scholastic; Mortar Board, senior 
women activities; Delta Skull, 
junior men activities; Scimitar, 
sophomore men activities; Cwens, 
sophomore women activities; 
Theta Tau, engineering junior 
scholastic; and Pi Tau Sigma, me
chanical engineering.
Fraternity and dorm men will 
crowd the sidelines to cheer their 
favorites in this afternoons pre
liminary and tomorrows final 
sweepstakes. F^ushmobiles, design
ed, constructed, and pushed by 
men of the various organizations, 
are one of the traditional features 
of carnival weekend. The vehicles 
will be judged both on speed and 
design.
The sorority girls get their turn 
in the spotlight at one tomorrow 
afternoon in the roller derby. The 
three lap relay race will be com
plicated by the presence of an 
untouchable egg on the end of a 
spoon carried by each girl. A 
broken or touched egg will penal
ize the skater to start the lap 
again.
Tau Beta Pi Holds 
Initiation Dinner
Tau Beta Pi, national engineer
ing honorary, will hold its initia
tion banquet in the Royal York 
apartments on May 7 at 7:00 p. 
m. Dr. Mavis of the civil engineer
ing department will act as toast
master. As principle speaker at 
the banquet, Dr. Max Schoen, 
professor of psychology, will dis
cuss The Education of the Hu
man Being.
The fifteen students who are to 
be initiated are Robert I. Van 
Nice, Wilbert Ferguson, Vernon 
Neubert, James Woodford, Thom
as Culbertson, Paul Ohrman, Mon 
Yee, Howard Morrison, Anthony 
Marmo, Richard Burk, James Wil
liams, John Ewart, Charles Duffet, and William Carpenter, with 
Dale A. Wright being chosen as 
honor junior.
In order that the pledges may 
more fully realize the social re
sponsibility of the engineer, it is 
required that each pledge write 
an essay dealing with a particular 
phase of this subject. The out
standing paper of the present 
pledge class will receive an award 
at the banquet.
It is the purpose of Tau Beta 
Pi to mark in a fitting manner 
those who have conferred honor 
upon their school by distinguished 
scholarship and exemplary char
acter as undergraduates. This cri
terion, together with integrity, 
breadth of interest, both inside 
and outside the field of engineer
ing, adaptability, and unselfish ac
tivity forms the basis for the 
choice of members for this society.

Editors Armchair
The time has come to turn over our editorial pen to the 
capable hands of our successor, Mr. Aaronson. Weve enjoyed 
very much the privilege of expressing our views on campus 
affairs via this column, and hope that we may have accomplished 
something worthwhile in so doing.
We have :two parting shots as we prepare to leave our edit
orial armchair. The first is connected with attendance at Student 
Council meetings. There is a regulation which stated that 
members of Council having more than three unexcused absences 
from meetings shall lose their membership in Council. The 
flaw in this ruling is the unexcused. Attendance at Council 
meetings has been very poor, but almost all the absences are 
excused. It seems to us that there are very few things 
more important to the school than an effective Student Council, 
and we feel that participating in an intra-mural softball game, 
for example, is hardly an adequate excuse for missing a meet
ing.
Student-Faculty Cooperation
The second thing we have to discuss is more a suggestion 
than a complaint, It is this. The Student-Faculty Liaison Com
mittee in the College of Engineering has been doing a fine job. 
We would like to see such committees organized in both Mar
ero* Morrison and Pine Arts. We have had some acquaintance 
e Liaison Committee in the College of Engineering; it 
V fulfills a very necessary function. Wed like to see 
_ ~*xxe type of job being done in the other colleges.
We now join :the Monday afternoon bridge club of Tartan 
ex-editors. R. C. Eschenbach.
Thank You, Dick
There are apparently two subjects which every incoming 
college editor must cover well in his first editorial. The first of 
these is a proper extension of thank you and good luck to his 
predecessor.
This we do willingly, and with sincere pleasure, for Dick 
Eschenbach has done an excellent job during his brief tenure 
as editor. The Tartan has improved, and with it, certain campus 
conditions to which attention was called by Dicks editorials. 
It is therefore with regret that we bid him goodbye for a year 
while he joins his favorite avuncular organization for a little 
practical experience.
Apparently George is willing to be a good uncle for just 
so long, even to an honor junior of Tau Beta Pi, before he 
turns human and becomes Mr. Westinghouse, big businessman 
extraordinary, and host to his honored student guests.
And Now . . .
The other subject of the first editorial is introduced imme
diately after the battlers sleeves have been rolled up and se
cured, as above, and is to be approached with suitable vigor.
It should begin much as follows: In the past, it has been 
the weak-ankled custom of the editors of this Voice of Student 
Freedom to give way, time and again, before the steel will of 
the Administration. Effective immediately, this custom is abol
ished. We will now proceed to write whatever strikes our 
superior fancy, and will attack freely all campus injustices 
and outrages, each in its turn. Administration, here I come (or 
perhaps it should be we, in deference to the dictates of official 
editorial style)!
Having become moderately acquainted with this campus over 
three scattered years, we politely decline the golden mantle of 
the crusader. The yellow metal is too soft. And the battles of 
men are not particularly impressive, despite their ferocity. We 
are still inclined to match them against the wars of men.
The Policy
We will, however, comment each week upon campus life and 
oftentimes suggest an altered course for a portion of it when
ever we differ seriously with its trends. And as such we hope 
to be of service to our fellow students beyond the basic pur
pose of this paper. H. L Aaronson.

Dear Editor:
Honest criticism is invaluable 
if there is to be any artistic 
growth; and smug pseudo-intellec
tual naivite would be amusing if 
it wasnt so unknowingly insidi
ous. Since literary criticism is a 
form of art, it is as open to criti
cism as the art it attempts to 
criticize.
The function of the critic  
any man who undertakes the work 
of airing his views in print as
sumes the critics responsibility 
is not to show how clever he can 
be, but to prove through construc
tive observation how and where 
the artist has failed. This, only so 
that the artist, be he playwright, 
sculptor, or ping-pong champ of 
Rumania, profiting by his past 
mistakes, may begin anew to 
strive for that evasive, satisfy
ing measure of perfection.
Far be it from me to impinge 
my personal sense of values, taste, 
or appreciation upon my fellow 
man, but for Mr. Dorffs edifica
tion (since he was mentally de
capitating the author when he 
should have been watching the 
play) the theme of Coronados 
Children is: the fallability of man 
in his continued quest for things 
material. That this magnificent 
theme wasnt realized as fully as 
it might have been is certainly no 
reason to stifle any future creative 
attempts. ^
I can safely say that both Mr. 
Young and the Drama Depart
ment were constantly aware of 
the shortcomings inherent in the 
script. I can also say that with the 
said deficiencies in mind, the de
partment is to be commended for

FRIDAY, MAY 2, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Six of the Boys
Everybody has heard of theRock and Riot Performances 
Adjudged Excellent By ReviewerSextette from Lucia. Not every
body has heard of the Sextette 
from Scotch and Soda, but by the 
looks of things they soon will. 
The members of the Sextette are 
six graduating seniors, the execu
tive board of Scotch and Soda.
Les Stanford, who has been a 
member of the organization long
er than anyone else on campus, 
entered Carnegie in 1939 and par
ticipated in the 40 and 41 shows, 
both on the acting and technical 
end. He was also one of the foun
ders of fall carnival, since dis
appeared from campus.
He left school in December 1941 
for pilot training in the Army 
Air Corps. After flying his B-26 
through sixty-nine missions in the 
European theater, he was sent to 
staff school at Harvard, from 
which he was later discharged.
Since his return to school in 
September 1946, Les has been 
seen in Time of Your Life, in 
College Widow as the football 
coach, and in You Cant Take It 
With You, as Kolenkov. Among 
his outside activities are intra
mural athletics for his fraternity, 
Sigma Nu; swimming team; stu
dent council, as senior representa
tive for fine arts; and WCIT staff. 
His is the mellifluous voice which 
describes the Carnegie sports 
scene every Monday evening.
Les fills one of the big jobs for 
Scotch and Soda  that of stage 
manager. His heart must really 
be in the work, for he also finds 
time to act the part of a gang
ster in the show. About Rock n 
Riot he says, Even though the 
41 show was considered the peak 
production, the current show is 
going to surpass it and set a new 
standard for future productions.
Businessman Boyce
Jim Boyce, who gave the show 
its name, believes that the show 
will be a standard for years to 
come. Jim entered Carnegie in 
1940 as an aeronautical engineer. 
In July 1943 he left for the Air 
Corps, where he served as per
sonal aid to Lt. Generals Barton 
H. Yount and James P. Hodges.
Since his return in March 1946 
as a drama student, he has been 
seen as Richard in Ah, Wildernett, the detective in Time of 
Your Life, and an eccentric 
scholar in College Widow. Some 
of his multitudinous activities on 
campus have been steward of DU 
fraternity; treasurer of student 
council; charter member of ODK, 
senior activities honorary; presi
dent of freshman class in fine arts; 
and Spring Carnival committee 
in 1942, 43, and 47. He can lay 
just claim to the title of Arch
bishop of Carnegie Tech, for he 
has personally crowned three car
nival queens.
Even this hectic activity seems 
restrained by the side of his lab
ors as chairman of the executive 
board and business manager of 
Scotch and Soda. His friends say 
he has even begun to laugh like 
a cash register. Jim may be found 
any lunch hour in Skibo, selling 
tickets to anyone who wanders 
by.
His plans for the future are 
somewhat indefinite, but he ex
pects to go to the west coast after 
graduation on fraternity business.
Motyl, the Writer
The next voice in the sextette 
belongs to*Ernie Motyl. Together 
with Dave Crantz, Ernie wrote 
the book for Rock n Riot. In ad
dition to acting the part of Byron 
Teedle, a dumb detective, he 
handles publicity for the show and 
is responsible for the magnificent 
signs that have appeared in Skibo.
He is a production major in the 
drama department. Recently he 
has been seen here at Carnegie as 
Kit Carson in Time of Your 
Life and Paul Sycamore in You 
Cant Take It With You. The 
Playhouse has also employed his 
talents, notably in Joey de 
Vivre,? a benefit for the Free French several years ago.His interests embrace the entire
entertainment world. Before en
tering Carnegie in 1940, Ernie 
played the drums in an orchestra 
which he had with Dick Hoch, his 
room-mate here and conductor of 
Rock n Riot. He was also con
nected with the assistant technic
al director of two films: What to 
Do in an Air Raid, and What to 
Do in a Gas Attack. After gradua
tion he hopes to enter the field 
of advertising and publicity for 
theater, radio, cinema, and the 
rest of the entertainment world.
Ernie too is an old time Scotch 
and Soda member. He played in 
the shows of 41 and 42 before 
entering the Army Air Corps in 
1943. After spending eighteen 
months as an aerial photographer 
on Saipan, he returned to Car
negie in January 1946, in time to 
appear in Take It From Here, 
the trial balloon for the groups 
rejuvenation this year.
Parks, Technical Director
Technical director of Rock n 
Riot, in charge of crews, sets, cos
tumes, and lighting is Bob Parks, 
a senior dramat. His recent rols 
have been the inquisitor in St. 
Joan and the prospector in Cor
onados Children. He also was 
seen at the Playhouse several 
years ago in Count Your Bless
ings. His resonant voice may be 
heard every week on the radio 
program, Adventures in Research, 
for Westinghouse.
Bob entered Carnegie in Sep
tember 1940. In 1943 he left for 
an infantry training outfit, from 
which he was transferred to a spe
cial services group in charge of 
routing such USO shows as Sin
atra and the Andrews sisters. He 
returned to school in the spring 
of 1946.
He holds the Norman Apell Me
morial Scholarship, given annu
ally to a senior of the drama de
partment in honor of Norman 
Apell, a drama student who lost 
his life fighting the Germans. He 
has been instrumental in setting 
up WCIT and is a member of 
ODK, senior activities honorary.
Bob believes Rock n Riot will 
be a great show because of the 
spirit and cooperation of those 
involved, both student and facul
ty; in this respect, the faculty of 
the drama department deserves 
special praise, he says. Bobs final 
word was, The show will be 
better than Mask and Wig. Our 
women dont have hairy legs.
The Assistant Director
A1 Checco, assistant director of 
Rock n Riot entered Carnegie in 
1940. Before leaving for the army 
in the spring of 1943, he appeared 
in The Winters Tale, Fash
ion, as Capulet in Romeo and 
Juliet, and in a number of war 
bond shows.
During part of his twenty-three 
months of duty in the southwest 
Pacific he played in Stars and 
Gripes by Harold Rome, compos
er of Call Me Mister. He was in 
the amazing total of 1260 per
formances, often giving three or 
four a day.
His return to campus saw him 
as Martin Banderhof in You 
Cant Take It With You and as 
the judge in Trial by Jury, as 
well as in the Playhouse produc
tions, Boy Meets Girl and Af
ter Hours. He was also instru
mental in founding WCIT. After 
graduation he hopes to act on the 
professional stage and will make 
his way to Broadway and The 
Great White Way.
A1 played in the 1941 Scotch 
and Soda show and has seen most 
of the rest, regular and informal. 
He thinks Rock n Riot is the 
best-rehearsed and highest-spirited of them all and that its script 
and music is on a par with any 
of them.
And A Physicist
Completing the sextette is Er
nie Lowenstein, a senior in the 
physics department. Although this 
is the first Scotch and Soda show 
for which he has been in school, 
he holds the important position of 
publicity director. Credit for the 
colorful spread in last Sundays
For some two hundred students 
of all departments Spring Car
nival, in spite of its unusual at
tractions, will be something of an 
anti-climax because Rock n Riot 
is over. For months they had spent 
much of their free time in prep
aration for the show, working and 
rehearsing ever increasingly long 
hours  almost continuously this 
last weekend  to whip the pro
duction into shape  and then, in 
a flash, the three performances 
were held and their work finished.
On Monday the actors, the 
dancers and singers, the crews 
and all other S&S members will 
once again be just students, but 
at least they will know that all 
their work was well worth it, for 
Rock n Riot was really terrific!
It is almost impossible to say 
to whom most of the credit for 
this musical comedy should go 
to Kenny Welch and Champ Pal
mer for their excellent music and 
lyrics, to Ernie Motyl and Dave 
Crantz for their hilarious book, to 
Mr. Carra for his skillful direct
ing, or to the dancers, actors, 
singers, and musicians. Rock n 
Riot could not have been as good 
as it was without outstanding 
work on the part of each and ev
ery one of the persons connected 
with the production.
Among the actors, the undis
puted star of Rock n Riot is Er
nie Motyl. Playing the dimwitted 
detective Byron Teedle, he gives 
one of the funniest performances 
ever seen around Carnegie, and at 
limes rivals some of the best 
Broadway stars. A first rate com
edian, he has a sense of timing 
which makes every one of his 
lines and actions howlingly fun
ny. There is nothing sophisticated 
about him  as evidenced both 
by his acting and his writing 
his is the kind of humor that 
evokes thunderous belly laughs 
and sends the audience rolling in 
the aisles.
No one can be funny on stage 
without able support from the 
rest of the cast, and Ernie Motyl 
has no reason to complain. George 
Wood, as the only slightly less 
imbecile senior partner of Farhnsworth and Teedle, detective agen
cy, proved that he is as funny 
in a low brow comedy like Rock 
n Riot as he is in the highly so
phisticated satires he writes him
self. Lucy Seibert established her
self again as the outstanding com
edienne at Carnegie Tech, and 
Elly Hovde (Gertrude) showed 
her amazing versatility  to perPress Roto section and for the 
flood of publicity which has en
gulfed Pittsburgh stores, clubs, 
and newspapers goes to him.
This is not the only evidence of 
his outstanding ability, for Ernie 
has a biilliant academic record; 
he has been editor-in-chief of the 
Tartan; president of Tau Delta 
Phi; member of Pi Delta Epsilon, 
journalism honorary; member of 
Tau Beta Pi, engineering honor
ary; member of Men's Glee Club; 
a founder of Student Liaison com
mittee; and business manager of 
WCIT.
form with equal competence in 
Saint Joan, In Relative Time, 
King Lear, and Rock V Riot is 
quite a feat.
Like Ernie, Dave Crantz de
serves double credit, both as a 
co-author of the book and one of 
the outstanding comedians in the 
show. Into the small part of Dr. 
Sporty he injects a great amount 
of humor, and it is good to know 
that Dave will still be here next 
year to star in the 1948 Scotch and 
Soda production. The same is true 
of Bill Putch and Danny Franks 
as the deans.
Last but quite certainly not 
least among the major actors are 
Les Stanford, Norm Keats, and 
Stan Schiller as the gangsters. 
Their incredible song and dance 
in the second act  reminiscent 
of the hippopotamis Dance of the 
Hours in Disneys Fantasia  
is one of the highlights of the
show. Bert Pollock makes a brief 
but effective appearance as Dr. 
Chasm, and Judy Lambert is ex
cellent as Jane, his fifth colum
nist.
Acting is only a part of a mu
sical comedy; the adjective im
plies melodies, dancers, singers, 
and musicians, and for this un
limited credit must be given to 
Kenny Welch, and Champ Pal
mer. It is their tunes which are 
beautifully sung by Herbert Wil
son and Phyllis Petrikin and the 
singing chorus, their music which 
was strikingly arranged by Dick 
Hoch and his collaborators, their 
rhythms to which Ruth Pivorotto and Jane Culp rehearsed a 
chorus and designed dances.
The best song in the show is a 
stunningly beautiful beguine In 
the Quiet of the Evening which, 
happily, gets the production it so 
richly deserves. First sung by 
Phil Petrikin and Herb Wilson 
with an excellent orchestral arfangement, it then becomes the 
basis for a striking ballet featur
ing Ruth Pivirotto and A1 Leh
man, with Bill Ryan, George Corrin, Joe Schlafman, Dottie Kaye, 
and part of the dancing chorus. 
The choreography, done by Ruth 
Pivirotto, is amazingly ambitious, 
and it is done full justice by the 
dancers.
The other romantic melodies of 
the show are as tuneful as the 
comedy numbers are funny. 
Were Not the Girls We Used to 
Be brings down the house when 
Elly Hovde and Lucy Seibert sing 
it, and the opening number, Does 
the Sun Ever Shine in Pitts
burgh, is something which 
must be heard to be appreciated. 
Other melodies are sung by Rene 
Orkin, and by the clubs Dis
covery of the Year, Gloria Berg
man, who combines a beautiful 
voice with an excellent, natural 
stase presence.
Neither the actors nor the sing
ers could accomplish very much 
without the choruses and the or
chestra, and to them also must 
go a major part of the credit for 
the success of Rock *n Riot. Both 
the mass singing and dancing are 
excellent, and the musicians un
der the direction of Dick Hoch provide at all timss the all-im
portant backbone of the show.
All the people mentioned above, 
and the many others in the walkons and bit parts share the lime
light and the applause during the 
performances, and aS usual the
back stage workers are the un* 
sung heroes of the production. ^ 
Under the direction of Robert  
Parks the designers, the carpen
ters, costumieres, light and sound 
crews and all others on the tech
nical staff did an outstanding job, 
and if orchids are to be given out, 
they deserve a major share. The 
five revolving stages, the striking 
costumes, and lighting effects, as 
well as the more prosaic but 
equally important carpentry, the 
sound system, and the other dir
ty work are usually taken for 
granted, but especially in a place 
like the Music Hall, where nor
mally there is just a platform and 
an auditorium, no production 
could be put on without them.
A lot of people were mentioned 
in this review, but if full credit 
could be given, many more would 
find their name in this column. A 
musical comedy like Rock n Riot 
is a mosaic composed of several 
big parts and many small ones, 
and like the proverbial chain, it 
is only as strong as its weakest 
link.
Scotch and Soda is back; it has 
returned triumphantly, and the 
many people who enjoyed this 
years show can now settle back 
and wait for the bigger and bet
ter ones to come. Rock n Riot 
was terrific, but the 1948 show 
will be better yet!

Asks Ad mission
Those interested in courses at 
the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology ar urged to file this ap
plication as far in advance of the 
time of intended entry as possi
ble. It seems that Jeffrey Byrd 
Morrison took this bit of advice 
printed on the bottom of the ap
plication blank quite seriously 
and applied eighteen years in ad
vance.
Howard P. Morrison, a student 
here, decided that his four-dayold son should not have to worry 
about crowded campus conditions 
and sent in an application blank. 
Young Jeffrey has an impressive 
record, having graduated from St. 
Margarets Hospital in excellent 
standing, and he plans to enroll 
as a freshman in October, 1965, in 
the department of management 
engineering.
In reply to this application, Mr. 
Daniels sent a quantity of sup
plementary information about 
courses of study and entrance re
quirements. He advised the junior 
member of the Morrison family to 
rearrange his curriculum to in
clude hygiene and to send a re
cent photograph of himself. The 
entire department in charge of 
admissions is looking forward to 
seeing its youngest applicant.

Naval Reserve 
Calls For Men
Men, have you considered all 
the facts behind the Naval Re
serve? Regardless of your past 
experience with the military, look 
into the facts before making any 
decision. All non-veterans be
tween the ages of 17 and 18^ may 
join, as well as veterans from any 
branch of the service.
The inactive reserve, V-6, does 
not interfere in any way with 
civilian life, except in case of a 
national emergency. A man may 
resign from the inactive reserve 
by writing a letter to the District 
Commandant at any time.
Upon joining the reserve, eith
er active or inactive, a recruit is 
sworn in, but no physical exam
ination is required for veterans. 
Only the active reserve supplies 
new uniforms free. On cruises un
der the V-6, uniforms must be 
bought. Cruises are voluntary for 
inactives, however, and may be 
taken at any time.
The inactive reserve is in effect 
the same as being subject to the 
draft, except that the navy re
ceives priority to a mans services 
in case of a national emergency.

of which is to subtly divest you 
of as much money as possible.
When we found this out, we im
mediately tied our purse-strings 
in a Gordian knot and entered the 
nearest booth. It was being run 
by a Beta Sig who bore a striking 
resemblance to Neptune, and its 
theme was the Nautical Naughties. The divertisements offered 
were spearing fish and ringing 
mermaids. We were unable to 
make Neptune divulge his 
source of mermaids, and so we 
passed on.
In the next couple of booths we 
found that the Sigma Nus and the 
AEPhis were condescending to 
accept the money lost in penny 
pitching games, the TXs running 
a dart-throwing deal, and Dorm 
Council with a ring-toss. Citcom 
was fairly confident that no one 
could shoot out candles with a 
water pistol, and the SAEs gave 
high odds on not being able to hit 
Doug Wilde with a popgun.
On entering the Cafe de Royal 
Palais we were accosted by a 
number of Tri Delts who tried to

convince us that they were French 
flower girls, and also to skin us 
on some soft drinks. We eluded 
them and went into the booth 
marked Delta Tau Delta, confi
dent that there we would find 
something more potent in the way 
of beverages. We were so right. 
A large crowd had gathered and 
was engaged in throwing base
balls at milk bottles, with the 
hope of winning tickets for free 
beer at the Greeks.
While dodging three pickpock
ets, who were probably DUs, 
since they have no other conces
sion, we observed that the Phi 
Kaps were making money on 
the horses, the ATOs on photo
graphs and a pendulum which 
proved that the physics depart
ment is wrong, the DGs on coke 
(too bad the OPA is out of existance), and the Tau Delts on 
your inability to hit two donkeys 
with a baseball. The PiKAs were
luring suckers with Win a dolly 
for your doll at the hugly-buck 
booth, while the Chi Os were 
enticing more suckers, and much 
more successfully, too, with an 
oriental bazaar complete with 
dancing girls, food, dancing girls, 
music, dancing girls, souvenirs, 
and dancing girls.
In the' next booth we were 
greeted by several rather soggy 
Betas, who (like Available Jones) 
were willing to do anything for a 
price, even be ducked. We then 
passed the Theta booth where hot 
dogs and ice cream was being 
sold for exorbitant prices, and 
with hope high in our heart en
tered Club 624, for the sign 
outside said that here one could 
win money. We were about to cut

versation with the proprietor dis
closed that the Kappa Sigs are 
planning to build a new house.

Rumor has it that Bill Tikey 
has lost his pin. Its whereabouts 
are unknown, but suspicion is that 
the loss was not accidental.
The Sigma Nus travelled to 
Westminster College last Saturday 
to initiate the 100th chapter into 
the National Fraternity. The fel
lows adjourned to the JanJan Inn 
in Hubbard after the ceremonies 
to teach the new initiates the fra
ternity songs and compare beer 
consuming aptitudes.
As a result of recent elections 
the Sigma Nu officers for the com
ing year will be: Commander
Pete Cregut; Lt. Commander, Joe 
Brown; Treasurer, Bob Smith; Re

Ralph Reich.
Frank Schierberl and his fellow

Condit, Will, Goldman, Dorff 
On Initial WCIT Quiz Program
WCITs new question program 
has been acclaimed such a suc
cess that it has been renamed 
with a title carrying the dignity 
and prestige that it deserves. The 
show is now called Challenge to 
Knowledge, and features Dr. Con
dit, Peggy Will, A1 Goldman, and 
Marty Dorff, with James McMichael as quizmaster.
On the first broadcast, one out 
of every six questions submitted 
was difficult enough to stump the 
experts. Next week, each unan
swered question will obtain for 
its author a years subscription to 
the Scottie. This policy of award
ing a one year subscription to 
the Scottie to the originators of 
questions that stump the experts 
will be continued each week. 
Questions should be placed in 
the WCIT box on the bulletin 
board in Skibo.
The Jazz program had a com
bination of expert music critics 
last Wednesday. Jay Marrata was 
invited in as Ash Etkas guest and 
both proferred comments on cur
rent jazz recordings.
In addition to regular staff 
openings a new type of position
on WCIT is now available to in
terested students. Those students 
in Margaret Morrison College and 
the College of Engineering and 
Science who would like to ac
quire experience in radio acting 
should place their name and tele

THE CARNEGIE TARTANFRIDAY, MAY 2, 1947
S 4 ^ Tech Sports Scope
By Pete Cregut
Although it has not been preceeded by a fan fare and dancing 
, the streets, the 1947 version of Techs football juggernaut is al;ady starting to take shape. Coach Bill Donahoe has had the boys 
own in the field house collecting information about the new men, 
ning up the old men and generally getting things in good shape for 
le coming season.
Unfortunately, due to a schcool policy (theres that bug-a-boo 
igain) the spring practice has to
je kept to a minimum. In this case 
will be a week long. While this; 
oes not even leave time for any 
contact or conditioning work, it 
will afford time to tie down all 
;he loose ends so that when fall 
omes along the boys can get 
ight down to work.
Fall practice will be inauguratd by what will be termed sum
mer camp. This will consist of & 
lys starting in September, which:

ision in the evening. The School

ils during this time. 
rhile on the surface this may 
seem to be much time to get

Donahoe is rather optimistic.

onditioning. If so, the team 
start contact work shortly 
er reporting and make up for 
:t additional time that most of 
r opponents will have spent 
ing the spring and summer.
Jll in all the general outlook; 
one of optimism. In fact it is 
ch that Bill Donahoe has made 
known that he is willing to be 
.oted as feeling that we should 
ave a successful season the next

sort has been worth many a 
coachs neck. If he is willing to 
say it. Bill must be pretty sure of 
what he speaks.
From where we sit, winning 
more games than we lose still 
seems a little far away but there 
should be some big improvements. 
Inexperience was the biggest 
problem last year and with letter 
men to fill nearly every position 
this time, that should not be a 
major handicap next year. And 
then if the Steffen fund produces 
some of its expected material we 
may surprise some of our op
pressors of a year ago.
There Was A Reason
In reference to our statements 
of two weeks ago concerning our 
contention that the school is not 
wholly behind the desire for a 
winning football team, an ex
planation of the administrations 
reason for blocking the Dorm 
Councils contribution has come to 
light. In all fairness, it deserves 
to be heard.
The whole action was based on 
the contention that Dorm fund is 
not a voluntarily solicited fund 
and since it is compulsory for 
every student living in the Dorms 
to contribute to it for social events
Large Squad Out 
For Football
Sixty men, all aspirants for 
Techs 1947 football team, met 
with Bill Donahoe at the Field 
house last week to mark the be
ginning of what promises to be 
a reawakening of Tartan gridiron 
supremacy.
With new spirit and a desire for 
revenge, the big squad set about 
getting things in shape for the 
beginning of heavy practice next 
fall. With 30 men from last years 
team, 20 of which are lettermen, 
returning to the war, Coach Dono
hue is full of optimism over what 
can be accomplished.
As a backbone for the coming 
eleven, Mr. Donahoe can rely on 
such men as Norm Keats and 
Gerry Meyers at tackles; John 
Maxton, Roly Guttendorph and 
John Sant at guards; C. B. 
Groomes and Jim Trautman at 
center along with Larry Maley, 
Joe Wilson, Jack Donahoe, Primo 
Pappaffava, Les Wahrenburg, 
Regis ORourke and Wes Kenny in 
the backfield. Sam Highberger has 
not yet decided whether to go out, 
but if he should decide against it 
his kicking and running will be 
sorely missed.
during the semester, the Adminis
tration must maintain some con
trol over its disposal. Since con
tributions to the Steffen fund 
were not wholly in keeping with 
the reason for the existence of 
such a fund, it was felt that the 
money should not be allowed to be 
used in such a manner.

Trackers Win First Victory; $
Geneva Overpowered 70-56
The Tech Trackers scored their first victory of the season last 
week in the Carnegie bowl when they beat Geneva College 70-56. Plac
ing first in nine of the events, the Plaid had little trouble beating 
the one man trackteam from Geneva.
It seemed like Merle Andrews was the only man on the field for 
the Covenanters as he gathered twenty-four points in eight events. 
Andrews won the 120 low hurdles, placed second in the 100 and
220 yard dashes plus four fieldThere Was A Day
Back in 1323 Carnegie Techs 
football team won their first vic
tory over the University of Pitts
burgh. The win for the Plaid came 
after ten long years filled with 
constant reverses to the neighbor
ing rival. The record of that 1923 
eleven was:

The captain of the 1923 team 
was James A. Robertson who 
scored the winning touchdown in 
the Pitt game. Jimmy is one of 
the only two men in Carnegie

of four major varsity sports. 
Jimmy won nine letters in all; in

events and finished third in the 
high jump.
The Tartans, however, were a 
little better this week against 
Geneva than they were in their 
opening meet at Cleveland. Ernie 
Cassler broke the tape this week 
in the 100 dash at 10.1, which 
was seven seconds better than the 
previous week. Other improve
ments in time were made in the 
220, 880, mile, and two mile runs. 
The biggest improvement in the 
Tartans this week was noted in 
the track events where four firsts 
were recorded and five seconds. 
Tech continued to score heavily 
in the field events and lost only 
one first all afternoon to Rape in 
the javelin throw.
Warren Ware and John Riehl 
won the pole vault and high jump 
respectfully for the second straight 
week to remain unbeaten, while 
Bill Beamer met the tape for the 
first time this season when he ran 
a 4:31 mile.

Scholarships Available 
For Evening Students
Mr. McKelway has announced 
that there will be a number of 
scholarships available again this 
year. They are of two general 
types: Evening Carnegie schol
arships and Evening honor schol
arships.
Evening Carnegie Scholarships
For new students. These schol
arships are available each year 
to students entering the first 
year of the degree curriculum 
in Architecture of the College of 
Fine Arts and the first year cur
ricula of the College of Engineer
ing and Science on the basis of 
high scholastic standing and finan
cial need. The value of these 
scholarships is as follows:
College of Engineering and Sci
ence$85.00 a year; ($42.50 a 
semester).
Architecture, College of Fine 
Arts$65.00 a year; (32.50 a 
semester).
To be eligible to compete for 
one of these scholarships, the ap
plicant must rank in the upper 
seventh of his senior class, must 
be recommended by his high 
school principal, and must meet 
the full requirements for admis
sion. These awards are made for 
one year only, and the recipient 
must schedule in each semester 
the number of units equivalent to 
the first year program as listed in 
the catalog.
Applicants for Evening Carne
gie Scholarships must (1) file the 
application for admission before 
August 10, (2) take the prescribed 
entrance examination, (3) file the 
scholarship application before 
September 15. Application blanks 
may be obtained at the Registrars 
Office. 
Evening Honor Scholarships
For present students. A num
ber of scholarships of varying
amounts are awarded ecl. year 
on the basis of high scholas
tic standing and financial need to 
undergraduate evening students 
who have been in attendance dur
ing the previous year.
To be eligible to compete for 
one of these scholarships, a stu
dent must have successfully com
pleted the preceding college year 
in one of the regular undergrad
uate evening programs at the Car

six attendance hours per week for 
the year (in the department of 
music, at least 18 units for the 
year), exclusive of the Supple
mentary Term.
Amount of Award
Each award will be computed 
by multiplying the number of 
units carried by the student dur
ing the preceding year, including 
the Supplementary Term, if any, 
by one-half the current tuition 
fee rate per unit. The computed 
award will be issued in the form 
of a credit to be applied (onehalf each semester) toward the 
tuition fee for the current year. 
In no case will the credit allowed 
be in excess of the tuition fee 
charged in either semester.
Students who wish to be con
sidered for these scholarships
