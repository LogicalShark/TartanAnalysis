As of approximately 10 p m. 
Jan. 28, about 150 cases of 'gas
tric upset were reported to the 
C-MU infirmary. Four students 
were admitted to Shadyside Hos
pital. but as of the latest report 
all are okay and will probably 
be released tomorrow, Jan. 29.
Symptoms were nausea, and in 
some cases abdominal pain. By 
6 p.m. Jan. 28, 200 complaints had 
been filed at the Student Health 
Service. Although there was still 
a trickle of students at the infirm
ary, there is speciftation that 
many of these late comers might 
be merely sympathizers.
The cause has not yet been def
initely pinpointed as food poison
ing, although this is the most like
ly possibility. The C-MU Depart
ment of Biology is assisting the 
University by undertaking an in
dependent investigation. The Al
legheny Health Service has taken 
food cultures and studied and in
terviewed students in trying to 
determine the cause of the illness.
Dean Swank commented that 
testing samples of food doesnt al
ways reveal microrganisms con
tained within the food. He added 
that the University would not hesi
tate to call in the United States 
Health Department in Atlanta if 
necessary.
As a precautionary measure, 
all Skibo food services were clos
ed while a thorough investigation 
is being conducted. Food service 
was made available in the Morewood and Mudge dining halls. Fur
ther, Skibo facilities have under
gone a thorough sterilization. All 
food stuffs that had already been 
opened in the Skibo dining room 
have been thrown away. In addi
tion, all employees of the Skibo 
kitchen have been examined for 
contagious infections.
The first cases of the gastric 
upset were reported to Shadyside 
Hospital where these kind of cases 
are normally handled. As the num
ber of cases increased, treatment 
was shifted back to the C-MU in
firmary because of the difficulty 
in transporting large numbers of 
patients. The Carnegie-Mellon 
staff received assistance from the 
Pittsburgh Police in replenishing
needed drugs and from the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh and C-MU 
security forces in transporting pa
tients.
At a meeting Wednesday after
noon of administrators and health 
service officials the decision was 
made not to reopen Skibo Thurs
day, Jan. 29. A meeting was call
ed for Thursday morning to dis
cuss results of the ongoing inves
tigation and to investigate wheth
er further precautionary meas
ures should be taken.
As of press time Thursday af
ternoon a full report from the 
campus investigating committee 
and the Allegheny County Health 
Service was not available. Food 
service in Skibo has been discon
tinued indefinitely. A report will 
be made to the campus commun
ity as to the cause of the illness as 
soon as possible.

Motion Asks Money To Aid 
"Legal Strategic Defense"
f8 d0iil8 Aon,xi
Despite a somewhat informal 
and even noisy meeting, the pro
ceedings of the Student Senate 
took on a note of relevance this 
week, that tended past the usual 
campus issues. Three different 
items of new business stressed 
the growing concern and interest 
which students now take in the af
fairs of the outside community. 
First, Senator Tom Burgess pro
posed the following motion:
Whereas the Student Senate 
has affirmed its belief in free 
speech and, whereas speech, free 
or otherwise in the court room is 
dependent on sufficient monetary 
support, we of the Student Senate 
support the proposition that:
1) Our present advocacy judi
cial system can function only with 
sufficient backing for those who 
need it.
2) We of the academic com
munity have a stake in providing 
for equitable judicial procedures.
We further take action by pro
viding for a fund to be known as 
the Legal Strategic Defense. Be
ginning in September, 1970, each 
school year, contributions totaling 
at least $1,000 shall be solicited 
from such campus sources as Stu
dent Senate, Faculty Senate, Ad
ministration, Activities Board, 
Office of Community Affairs, 
Board of Trustees, ect., and shall 
be used by the Student Senate for 
the legal defense in strategic 
cases.

American Civil Liberties Union 
was present to come to the aid of 
draft resisters and others who 
could not afford legal expenses. 
He also expressed doubt that the 
need for such a fund actually ex
isted, and objected to the notion 
of students being able to collect 
defense funds if they happened to 
get into trouble during their sum
mer vacations. Carter Allen point
ed out, however, that there would 
exist a committee to decide which 
cases merited support from the 
defense fund. He also reminded 
Pucshak that the ACLU is not able 
to aid every case that is brought 
to its attention.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOREditorial
Registration? Resistance
Editor. 2bx 2li.lnS
I think the following items 
should be of primary concern with 
regard to the registration system 
instead of change of course num
bers:
1. If numbers were used for de
partments on account of being 
more easily processed, why are 
two letters used for section 
names?
2. Pre-registration should be 
used for the following reasons:
(a) A student should plan ahead 
as to what to take. This means 
courses offered and schedules 
would be known earlier in which 
they should be known at least 
three weeks prior to the end of the 
previous semester.
(b) There would be an earlier 
estimate as to how many students 
are in each class so that class 
overflows may conceivably be 
checked before the semester ac
tually gets underway.
(c) The correct number of text
books could be ordered in order to 
both assure that each student may 
purchase his course texts and re
duce the overhead in the bookstore 
whose effects pass thorougly to 
students.
3. The course number changes 
should have been made after a 
pring semester to give more time 
to adjust the system so that, for 
example, transcripts could be up
dated at a more plausible time 
than weeks or months from now!
4. Course descriptions should be 
updated and made known to stu
dents at least four weeks before 
the semester commences.

Dear Students.
Reference is made to the treat
ment you afforded our Senator, 
as evidenced by the attached pic
ture. clipped from the front page 
of 2bx Hxey lnr Ca0ioxi- Charles

Behavior is a mirror in which 
every one displays his own im
age. Goethe.
The knowledge of courtesy and 
good manners is a very necessary 
study. . . . The first thing done in 
the corruption of manners is ban
ishing truth.Montaigne.
You had every right to disagree 
with anything Senator Thurmond 
said (and he would be the first to 
defend that right), but the least 
you could have done was to be 
courteous to a United States Sen
atoran invited guest to your 
campus.
As for Senator Thurmond's be
havior: "The beauty of good
breeding is that it adjusts itself to 
all relations without effort, true 
to itself always, however, the 
manners of those around it may 
change.Holmes.

Dear Mr. Fuller:
I have received your letter in
cluding your suggestion.
As you know. I have not in any 
public way supported draft resis
tance but have raised the general 
question and have continued to 
try to ease the condition of the 
war and to suggestion the easing 
of the draft laws for those who ob
ject to this war as well as amnes
ty for those who have left the coun
try or are in prison. I plan to con
tinue this same course.
Sincerely yours,

On Tuesday, Jan. 20, Senator 
Strom Thurmond was received 
with marshmallows instead of the 
conventional confetti (with equal
ly unconventional feelings.)
On Tuesday, Jan. 27  seven 
days later  approximately 150 
students were rushed to hospitals 
in the area for what is thought to 
be food poisoning.

The Finale
Editor. 2bx 2li.lnS
I wish to come to the defense of 
the marshmallow contingent, for 
we have been the subject of con
siderable outrage without reply. I 
cannot defend the people who 
were unable to control their angry 
emotions, and who repeatedly in
terrupted Brother Stroms re
marks, causing much confusion.
Surely there is no case for free 
speech, when the free speechers 
themselves turn the tables and re
sort to repression. As you cor
rectly asserted in your editorial, 
Stroms remarks were sufficient 
evidence of his sickness. The left 
bend no new heads that day, only 
furthered polarization.
Had the hecklers kept reason
ably quiet, the action might have 
been greeted with cheers. We 
were merely presenting Strom 
with our winter offensive"toast 
marshmellows, not people. It is 
too bad that people were so sick of 
the circus, they were unable to ap
preciate the finale.

Pollution
(Continued from Asof ap
produce a single ton of iron pel
lets. The waste residual of dust, 
or tailings, is produced at a rate 
of about two million tons per mil
lion tons of pellets.
The process of destroying the 
environment in order to produce 
paper begins with the cutting of 
logs. Even assuming that a given 
woodlot is farmedthat is, re
planted and not recklessly mowed 
downthe shipping of logs to the 
mill entails considerable destruc
tion. Rivers are bulldozed so that 
logs will not be caught by obsta
cles on the way to the mill.
The pollution problems that be
gin in Lake Superior are dupli
cated in Lake Michigan. There, 
heavy concentrations of industry 
produce vast quantities of chemi
cals and sewage, the better part 
of which are dumped raw or only 
partially treated into the lake.
All heavy industries, as well as 
thermal electric power stations, 
use vast quantities of water. Steel, 
automaking, petrochemicals, met
al refining, textilesall require 
vast amounts of water for cooling 
and cleansing purposes. Much of 
this is discharged back intmthe 
lakes as effluent. Some is lost as 
evaporation.
Annual use of water along the 
Great Lakes runs at approximate
ly 60,000 cubic feet per second, 
for industry, municipalties and 
agriculture. Of this amount, some 
2,300 cubic feet per second are 
used upi.e., do not return to the 
lakes.
Lake Ontario is rapidly follow
ing Erie in terms of pollution. Ex
cess nutrients already have turn
ed many popular beaches into 
ghatly spectacles of rotting scum 
and algae, unfit for any kind of hu
man use. Oil and chemical spil
lages and seepages are inexorably 
destroying the wildlife in this lake 
as in all the others.
At present rates of destruction, 
we will not have long to wait be
fore the limit will have been 
reached and passed in Lake Erie, 
when remedial action will have 
come too late.

Lake Michigan Dying; 
Lake Erie Now Dead
Friday, January 30, 1970THE TARTANPage 3
(CPS)When I lived in Chi
cago during the summer of 1967, 
says Michael Doran, lecturer in 
music at McMaster University, 
my apartment was situated 
about seven blocks from the 
shores of Lake Michigan (other
wise known at Gitchy-Gooey ).
Most days the smell of dead 
fish penetrated into my living 
room, even when the windows 
were closed.
Turning on the hot water tap 
one was invariably greeted by the 
smell of dead fish competing with 
that of cholorine. It ely possible 
to make coffee and tea, but the 
stuff was undrinkable.
From within a stones throw 
of the lake one could survey the 
magnificent solid silver band of 
rotting fish which lined the shore 
at the exact formal distance of five 
yards. Ah, Chicago! Ich habe lust 
vor dich!
During the summer of 1967, as 
well, the Chicago lake front was 
graced by an oil slick that extend
ed for some 75 miles.
The Cuyahoga River, flowing 
through Cleveland into Lake Erie 
is usually covered by a coating of 
petrochemical wastes averaging 
two inches in thickness. The riv
er is considered a fire hazard. 
Last year an arsonist set it ablaze 
and two bridges were seriously 
damaged.
Indeed, Cleveland's two fireboats wash oil from docks and pil
ings at regular intervals to mini
mize the risk of fire.
Cleveland is also one of the few 
cities which chlorinates its lakefront beaches in order to render 
them safe for swimming.
Meanwhile, the Great Lakes 
are dying.
Lake Erie has had it. In the last 
50 years the effect of human 
waste and alterations in the en
vironment has aged the lake 15,-
000 years.
Lake Michigan is periolously 
close to the point of no return. Its 
southern stretches are heavily pol
luted and contaminated, and this 
destruction is steadily spreading 
northward.
Lake Superior remains the pur
est of the lakes, while pollution in 
Lake Ontario is rapidly attaining 
critical proportions. Lake Huron 
stands as something of a halfway 
house between the purity of Su
perior and a cesspool that is Erie.
Taken together the Great Lakes 
drainage system constitutes the 
largest single body of fresh wa
ter in the world, containing better 
than one-fourth of the worlds sup
ply-In this case the word fresh is 
used only to distinguish the water 
from ocean brine, since in many 
cases the water in the Great Lakes 
is no more palatable than ocean 
water, and considerably less pure.
The entire Great Lakes basin 
supports a population well in ex
cess of 30 million, compared with 
fewer than 300,000 early in the 
19th century. This figure repre
sents about one in eight Americans 
and about one in three Canadians.
By 1965 the water levels of all 
five lakes had dropped to their 
lowest levels in recorded history. 
Erie and Huron were some five 
feet lower than during the early 
fifties.
This does not mean much until 
one realizes that a drop of one
foot in the Great Lakes water lev
el results in a loss of some 2.75 
trillion cubic feet of water.
This loss and all other changes 
which have taken place in the 
Great Lakes are attributable to a 
single cause: man. However,
what man has done to the lakes, 
and what he continues to at an ac
celerating rate involves many 
complex questions.
Ttoo examples of industrial pol
lution will suffice to indicate the 
great danger present to Lake Sup 
perior, as well as to all drainage 
basins. They are the refining of 
low-grade Taconite iron ore and 
the pulp and paper industry.
Taconite refining is a complex 
procedure of crushing and grind
ing the ore into fine particles and 
magnetically separating the iron 
from the residual dust and con
centrating the iron into pellets of 
magnetite.
In the process some 10,000 gal
lons of water are used in order to

Punitive 
Ruled
The U. S. Supreme Court has 
ruled that draft boards may not 
speed up the induction of young 
men into military service because 
they turn in their draft cards or 
otherwise violate the Selective 
Service Act.
There is nothing to indicate 
that Congress authorized the Se
lective Service System to reclas
sify exempt and deferred regis
trants for punitive purposes, and 
to provide for accelerated induc
tion of delinquents, wrote Justice William O. Douglas in the ma
jority opinion.
Justice Douglas said Congress 
had provided adequate ways to 
punish draft law violators through 
criminal law.
Some draft boards have been 
declaring delinquent those 
young men who turned in their 
draft cards or violated some other 
provision of the Selective Service 
Act. In some cases, those declared 
delinquent were then reclassified 
or swiftly inducted into military 
service.

Suit Filed in Wisconsin; Lottery Not Random 
Group Predicts 94% Available Men Will Go
(CPS)A suit has been filed in 
the U.S. District Court in Madi
son, Wis., seeking to overturn the 
draft lottery held last December, 
claiming it was not random.
Distpict Court Judge James 
Doyle declined to issue a restrain
ing order as was sought by the 
group filing suit, however, he also 
declined to dismiss the suit as was 
. requested by government attor
neys, saying that he sees a discre
pancy between the supposedly ran
dom selection ordered by the pres
ident and the actual result of the 
drawing.
The lawyer for the 13 plaintiffs 
named in the suid, David Heitzman, said this indicated the suit 
was obviously not frivolous. He 
characterized the case to date by 
saying were still in the discov
ery stage and are seeking posi
tive evidence that the lottery 
was not random.
Heitzman was to have come to 
Selective Service headquarters in 
Washington Jan. 22 to obtain depositcn from various members of 
the Selective Service. A deposi
tion is a testimony that is received 
while a clerk of the court is pre
sent to record it officially. Heitz
man indicated that the procedure 
can be roughly compared to crossexamining a witness.
Heitzman said that he intended 
to talk with Colonel Charles Fox 
and Captain William Pascoe, pub
lic information director, and pos
sibly General Lewis Hershey, SS 
director. Plans were also being 
made to film a re-enactment of 
the process used to randomize 
the lottery for evidence in the suit
Nixon Brings 
Hardship 
For 150,000
The Student National Education 
Association says some 150,000 
college students  many of them 
prospective teachers  will be
come college dropouts or tuition 
hardship cases if President Nix
ons expected veto of the $19.7 bil
lion HEW-Labor appropriations 
bill is sustained by Congress.
Charles Gonzales, president of 
SNEA and a student at New Mex
icos College of Sante Fe, charged 
Nixon with reneging on his cam
paign promise in 1968 when he 
stated: When we talk about cut
ting the expense of government, 
the one area we cant short-change 
is education.
Now that Mr. Nixon is in of
fice, the reality of his words and 
action seem to be in conflict, 
said Gonzales, who is currently 
doing independent study work at 
the Antioch College extension.
If the veto is not overriden, 
Gonzales said, about 150,000 col
lege students who receive loans 
under the National Defense Edu
cation Act will either be forced to 
drop out of college or face serious 
financial problems in paying for 
their tuition.
Of particular concern is the 
ethnic and minority student who 
will be most affected by the 
veto, Gonzales said. Is this an
other indication of the adminis
trations commitment ot our less 
fortunate brothers? he asked.
SNEA, Gonzales said, is calling 
on students and educators nation
wide to urge Congress to override 
the veto.
The appropriations bill includes 
$4.2 billion for education, but the 
President has promised to veto 
the measure because it exceeds 
his own budget request by $1.2 
billion. More than $1 billion of the 
increase in earmarked for educa
tion.
When CPS contacted Pascoe at 
Selective Service headquarters 
Jan. 19 he said that he knew noth
ing about the case, nor that Heitz
man planned to meet with him 
Thursday. He also declines to 
speculate what the implications 
would be if the lottery were to be 
over-turned. He said he was not a 
lawyer and not even sure what 
all the legal terms such as re
straining order and injunction 
meant.
David Stodolsky, one of the 
plaintiffs in the suit and graduate 
student at the University of Wis
consin at Madison, ran the ana
lysis on the lottery that indicated 
more men with birthdays from 
January to June received safer 
numbers that did those born in the 
rest of the year. He told CPS that
he became interested in the lot
tery when he looked at a partial 
analysis compiled by a staff mem
ber in the university computer 
center. He became convinced that 
the lottery was not random when 
he conducted a more thorough 
analysis.
Stodolsky drew^number 47 in the 
lottery, but says this has nothing
to do with the suid. According to 
the Wisconsin Draft Study Group, 
the organization backing the suit 
and doing other research on the 
draft, 94 per cent of the pool of 
available men in 1970 will be draft
ed. This group estimates that 344 
will be the average number reach
ed. As Stodolsky says, Almost 
everyone will go.
Venture: Seven minutes to save a life.
The problem: lifesaving clinical 
tests of blood, urine and spinal 
fluid may take technicians hours to 
perform using traditional methods.
The possible solution: design a 
virtually complete chemical labora
tory in a desk-sized cabinet that 
will perform a variety of clinical tests 
automatically, accurately, quickly.
The result: Du Pont's Automatic 
Clinical Analyzer, the end-product 
of years of cooperation and problem 
solving among engineering physi
cists, biochemists, electromechan
ical designers, computer specialists 
and many, many others.
The heart of the instrument is a 
transparent, postcard-sized reagent 
packet that functions as a reaction 
chamber and optical cell for a 
computer-controlled analysis of 
specimens.
Separate packsmade of a chem
ically inert, optically clear plastic
are designed for a variety of tests. 
And each pack is supplied with a 
binary code to instruct the analyzer. 
Packs for certain tests also contain 
individual disposable chroma
tographic columns to isolate spe
cific constituents or molecular 
weight fractions on the sample.
In operation, the analyzer auto
matically injects the sample and 
diluent into each pack, mixes the 
reagents, waits a preset time for 
the reaction, then forms a precise 
optical cell within the walls of the 
transparent pack and measures the 
reaction photometrically.
A built-in solid-state computer 
monitors the operation, calculates 
the concentration value for each 
test and prints out a report sheet
for each sample. The instrument is 
capable of handling 30 different 
tests, the chemistry procedures for 
ten of which have already been 
developed. The first test result is 
ready in about seven minutes. And 
in continuous operation, successive 
test results are obtained every 35 
to 70 seconds, depending on the 
type of test.
Innovationapplying the known 
to discover the unknown, inventing 
new materials and putting them to 
work, using research and engineer
ing to create the ideas and products 
of the futurethis is the venture 
Du Pont people are engaged in.

Army Takes Another Giant Step 
To Repress Political Acts
whosFl?.t 8lFak Ira Cliil9su7
tFl?c euCl?FeuJFaic Fsat su 9sFr Fra

"Zxip
The U.S. Army will soon put in 
operation a computerized data 
bank that will be capable of pro
viding the FBA, CIA, Secret Serv
ice and Army, Navy and Air 
Force commands across the U.S. 
with instantaneous information on 
past and present civilian political 
activity of all kinds, from anti
war speeches to campus demon
strations.
According to Christopher H. 
Pyle, a former captain in Army In
telligence, who wrote an article 
in the vlybon,.an dan.b8- the 
contents of the data bank will be 
taken from FBI and state and mu
nicipal police records, community 
and campus newspapers and re
ports compiled by nearly 1,000 
plainclothes investigators work
ing out of some 300 offices coast 
to coast.
Pyle said the team of investi
gators has been maintained by the 
Army since 1965. They were 
brought into being to provide ear
ly warning of civil disorders in 
which the Army might be asked to 
intervene, but since 1967 they have 
been involved in observing and re
cording any anti-establishment 
political activity. They have been 
aided by military agents who have 
posed as press photographers, 
anti-war demonstrations and as 
college students. The investiga
tors' reports are distributed via 
a nationwede teletype system.
Today, Pyle said, the Army 
keeps files on the membership, 
ideology, programs and practices 
of almost every political group in 
the country, including radical or
ganizations like the Revolutionary 
Action Movement and nonviolent 
ones like the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, ACLU, 
and NAACP. Utilizing the files, 
the Army periodically publishes 
a ' blacklist of people and or
ganizations who, in the opinion of
Intelligence Command officials, 
might cause trouble for the Army.
The files are maintained at the 
Investigative Records Repository 
at Fort Holabird in Baltimore 
where the computerized data bank 
will be installed. According to 
Pyle, material fed into the com
puter will fall into two general cat
egories: incident reports con
cerning bombings, disorders and 
demonstrations, and personality 
reports concerning the lawful 
and unlawful political activity of 
civilians.
Some of the information will be 
gathered by civilian spies. Pyle 
said that when Columbia Univer
sity gave students the option of 
closing their academic records to 
inspection by government investi
gators, the 108th Military Intelli
gence Group in Manhattan per
suaded an employee of the registrars office to leak information 
to them.
The information will be avail
able to the National Security 
Agency, Civil Service Commis
sion, Atomic Energy Commission. 
Passport Office and Defense In
telligence Agency.
Pyle said one reason for keep
ing tack of civilian political activ
ity, specified in counter-insurgency manuals, is to facilitate the ar
rest of counter-insurgents and 
guerrillas. He said soldiers and 
civilian employees of the Army 
with foreign-born spouses are cur
rently barred from jobs requiring 
access to sensitive intelligence, 
and this raises questions as to the 
ability of Army intelligence to use 
its information intelligently.

CIA's financing of student groups,

"Z" A/1 alces "/f" Naam Nem_ U nUeiv rUs_
Z by Jorges Semprum, a 
French-Algerian production by 
Jacques Perrin and Hamed Rachedi, directed by Constatin CostaGavras, released by Cinema V, 
starring Yves Montand, Irene Pa
pas and Jean-Louis Trintignant.
(CPS)The slogan may have 
become trite from overuse by the 
skin flick people, but it once more 
becomes appropriate when com
paring Z to previous attempts 
at movies on revolution. Z 
makes If . . (the best previous 
contemporary look at revolution) 
look like a fairy tale.
While If . . was very well 
executed and left its audiences 
ready to fight the good fight 
against injustice, it was just a 
Story. A parable, perhaps, but still 
fiction.
Z moves at the fast pace of 
fiction, but does not allow the 
viewer to forget the military take
over of Greece which is more than 
a mere story. Z leaves a real 
revolution in the lap of the view
er. The two-hour screen play 
races by, as Greeces anti-war 
and anti-bomb movement moves 
through stages of hopefulness, op
pression from the corrupt police
force and government in power, 
more hopefulness, and eventually 
destruction by the military which 
takes control when it appears a 
democratic election will shake its 
power base.
The film should do more to 
make people understand the des
truction of freedom in Greece to
day than could a thousand speech
es by visiting Greece political and 
artisan refugees seeking support.
And the similarities to fore
shadowing events in this country 
makes the drama all the more 
frightening. In Z there are the 
government efforts to eradicate 
the Black Panthers, the murders 
of the Kennedys and King, and the 
political assasination of United 
Mine Workers presidentail con
tender Yablonski. In Z there is 
the tremendous power of the mili
tary and the intolerance of the left 
that resembles Joe McCarthy eras 
in the past and, possibly, to come. 
The police and government keep 
close tabs on the left, so they can 
squelch it.
Z demonstrates how work
ing through the system  taking 
legal action against corruption  
may appear to work, but also how
the legal system can be insidious
ly undermined and ultimately 
crushed by the corrupt power 
structure.
Unfortunately, Z doesnt of
fer any alternatives that might be 
successful because in Greece to
day none are succeeding. Perhaps 
none can. But the producers do not 
seem to want the audience to give 
up hope; rather they want people 
to become acutely aware of what 
has happened on Greece and what 
is happening and can happen else
where. They want people to keep 
trying to find ways to create a 
world in which ideas, particularly 
ideas in support of peace, are not 
repressed.
Z has been called melodra
ma; that may be because this is a 
melodramatic world. But Z 
also has been called one of the 
best pictures not just of this year, 
but of any year. And that is un
doubtedly true.
Espite subtitles, there is no 
communication problem whatso
ever. The viewer totally forgets 
the movie is played in French, ra
ther than in his native tongue. 
Few Americans will ever realize 
that in one scene English is spok
en, for the French and subtitles 
have become so natural.
The action builds up quickly and 
lasts through the closing credits, 
which include an incredible list of 
ideas, authors, music, and other 
forms of expression no longer tol
erated in Greece.
As the film ends, the viewer 
feelsthere must be more. A de
quel, a followup. One cant just 
walk out of the theater and leave 
Greece as she is.
Whether or not it proves to be 
the award-winner it appears it will 
be, Z will certainly prove one 
of the most politically controver
sial films of our age. There al
most certainly will be theaters 
who will refuse to play it because 
of its message rather than its 
morals. In Greece, obviously, it 
will never be screened at all.
For, Z, which means He 
lives, tells too much about the 
assasination of Gregorios Lambrakis, who was killed after ad
dressing a peace rally opposing 
the installation of American Pol
aris missiles in Greece in 1963, 
and it tells to much about the 
events in Greece in the years 
since.
Based on Vassili Vassilikos 
book, Director Constantin CostaGavras uses his high-powered 
cast, including Yves Montand, to 
execute almost flawlessly the 
script by Jorge Semprun, author
of La Guerre Est Finie. There 
is no doubt the creators and cast 
had their hearts deeply in this 
one.
The composer of the musical 
score, Mikis Theodorakis, is un
der house arrest in Greece and 
had to smuggle the music out of 
the country to France. Such dedi
cation by those who made the film 
shows throughout.
There have been few films as 
sincere, as frightening, and as 
perfectas Z.

Senate
tay.eyD_g -iaG dUu_ o A
A fourth senator remarked that 
Dean Swank has in the past posted 
bail for students who have been 
arrested, but feared that financial 
support for a legal defense fund 
could not be made available.
1 Frank Pushak stated that he did
n't think that charges would be 
brought against anyone who exer
cised his rights legally, and that 
he felt that the Student Senate did 
not have the right to underwrite 
legal expenses in any case. Carter 
Allen responded that Puschak 
must have been assuming that one 
can only be arrested if guilty. He 
, strongly supported the proposal 
for a campus legal service, and 
mentioned that such a service 
could come to the aid of some of 
the many students who contest 
leases with their landlords.
At this point Pushak proposed 
an amendment which would have 
merely assured students of legal 
advice, but Burgess, who original
ly proposed the measure, exer!> cised his right to reject this 
amendment on the grounds that 
legal defense is still impossible 
without the necessary funds. At 
this point Ken Friend moved that 
the motion be tabled to the Rules 
Committee whose job it would be 
to decide whether legal funds were 
within the jurisdiction of the Stu
dent Senate. The motion to table 
was seconded by Burgess and car* ried.
The second item of note involv
ed a motion, again proposed by 
Tom Burgess, that the Student 
Senate petition national leaders 
for a complete, immediate, and 
unilateral withdrawal from Viet
nam. One senator, while agreeing 
with the sentiment of the motion, 
asked Burgess whether he thought 
b that such action were really the 
function of the Student Senate. The 
answer came that with  war com
panies recruiting on campus, 
and with the continual drafting of 
student-aged men into the armed 
services, that the formation of a 
pro- or anti-war policy was cer
tainly within the jurisdiction of 
the Student Senate. Carter Allen 
agreed that the Senate had the 
P right to express an opinion, and 
suggested that a campus-wide ref
erendum be held during the next 
campus election on this very is
sue. At which time David Adler 
amended the original motion to 
read that the motion would be sub
ject to a referendum at the next 
general election. Burgess object
ed on the basis of the fact that stu
dents would be given only a "yesno" choice and would not be able 
to express their precise attitude 
toward the war. He moved that 
the motion be tabled to commit
tee, and it subsequently was.
Toward the end of the meeting 
David Adler read the following
motion:
e The Student Senate reaffirms 
its support of the principle of Aca* demic Freedom. It would be hypo
critical, however, to demand this 
principle at C-MU and ignore its 
suppression in other educational 
institutions. Recently students at 
Taylor-Allderdice High School 
presented the Pittsburgh Board of 
Education with a set of recom
mendations which would extend 
the principle of academic freedom 
to the high schools, so far no ac* tion has been taken. We support 
such an extension and we urge Dr. 
Kibbee and the School Board to 
give this matter the consideration 
which it urgently demands. We

hope that the board will soon pro
duce concrete proposals rather 
than more of the rhetoric which 
has been the sole product of their 
deliberations so far.
Furthermore, the Senate re
quests Joe Duckworth to contact 
the presidents of the student 
bodies of the University of Pitts
burgh, Chatham. Carlow, and Duquesne for the purpose of drafting 
a statement supporting the high 
school students and to report back 
to the senate at the meeting on 
Feb. 3.
Because this issue was raised 
late in the meeting, it did not 
draw the discussion it perhaps de
served. It was passed almost sum
marily with little or no opposition. 
It is possible that many of ththose 
present did not realize the signi
ficance of their endorsement. The 
concept of student power is a rel
atively recent one, and has now 
begun to extend its influence from
the university down to the high 
school level. The passage of this 
motion asserts that the Student 
Senate wishes to express the sol
idarity it feels with the cause and 
plight of younger students who 
now wish a greater and more ac
tive role in their own education.
Several of the more mundane 
issues do merit mention. Spring 
elections will be held on March 11 
and 12. before the Easter break. 
Pat Cavanaugh, after finishing 
his banana, appointed a commit
tee to investigate recent actions 
of the C-MU public relations of
fice; such as the invitation which 
the office extended to the public 
to campus activities without noti
fying the Student Senate. Presi
dent Joe Duckworth will deliver 
the State of the University mess
age on Feb. 10 immediately prior 
to a joint meeting of the Student 
and Faculty Senates on the fur
ther discussion of Campus Code.

Meher Baba-Divine Incarnation of Aquarius
Meher Baba(Compassionate 
Father) is the Avatar (Divine In
carnation) of the Aquarian Age. 
Meher Baba has previously taken 
human form as Zoroaster, Rama, 
Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Mo
hammed in order to bring a new 
release of power, a new awaken
ing of consciousness, a new ex
perience of lifenot merely for a 
few, but for all. Baba says that he 
is the very same Ancient One, in 
flesh and blood, who is eternally 
worshipped and neglected, always 
remembered and forgotten. He is 
that Eternal One, whose past is 
worshipped and remembered; 
whose present is neglected and 
forgotten; whose future is always 
much desired and longed for.
The Avatar appears in different 
forms, under different names, at 
different times, in different parts 
of the world. As his appearance 
always coincides with the spirit
ual birth of man, so the period im
mediately preceding his manifes
tation is always one in which hu
manity suffers from the pangs of 
the approaching birth. Man seems 
more than ever enslaved by de
sire, more than ever driven by 
greed, held by fear, swept by an
ger. The strong dominate the 
weak; the rich oppress the poor; 
large masses of people are ex
ploited for the benefit of the few 
who are in power. The individual, 
who finds no peace or rest, seeks 
to forget himself in excitement. 
Immorality increases, crime 
flourishes, religion is ridiculed. 
Corruption spreads throughout the 
social order. Humanity grows 
desperate. There seems to be no 
possibility of stemming the tide 
of destruction. At this moment the 
Avatar appears.
The Avatar awakens contem
porary humanity to a realization 
of its true spiritual nature, gives 
liberation to those who are ready, 
and quickens the life of the spirit 
in his time. For posterity is left 
the stimulating power of his di
vinely human example, the nobil
ity of a life supremely lived, of a 
love unmixed with desire, of a 
power unused except for others, 
of a peace untroubled by ambition, 
of a knowledge undimmed by illu
sion. He has demonstrated the 
possibility of a divine life for all 
humanity, of a heavenly life on 
earth. Those who have the neces
sary courage and integrity can 
follow when they will.
Meher Baba asserts that he is 
the same Ancient One, come again 
fto redeem man from his bondage 
jpf ignorance and to guide him to 
realize his true self which is God. 
Baba came to sow the seed of love 
in mens hearts so that in spite of
all superficial diversity which 
humanity in illusion must experi
ence and endure, the feeling of 
oneness through love is brought 
about amongst all nations, creeds, 
sects and castes of the world.
Meher Baba gives no impor
tance to creed, dogma, caste sys
tems, and the performance of re
ligious ceremonies and rites, but 
to the understanding of the follow
ing seven realities: 1> The only 
real existence is that of the one 
and only God, who is the self in 
every (finite) self. 2) The only 
real love is the love for this Inrfinity (God), which arouses an inl tense longing to see, know, and be
come one with its truth (God).
3) The only real sacrifice is that 
in which, in pursuance of this love, 
all things, body, mind, position, 
welfare, and even life itself are 
"sacrificed.
4) The only real renunciation is 
that which abandons, even in the 
midst of worldly duties, all self
ish thoughts and desires.
5) The only real knowledge is 
the knowledge that God is the in
ner dweller in good people and socalled bad. in saint and so-called sinner. This knowledge requires 
you to help all equally as circum
stances demand, without expection of reward, and when com
pelled to take part in a dispute, to 
act without the slightest trace of 
enmity or hatred; to try to rriake 
others happy with brotherly or 
sisterly feeling for each one; to 
harm no one in thought, word, or 
deed, not even those who harm 
you.
61 The only real control is the 
discipline of the seneses from in
dulgence in low desires, which
alone ensures absolute purity of 
character.
7) The only real surrender is 
that in which the poise is undis
turbed by any adverse circum
stance, and the individual, amidst 
every kind of hardship, is resign
ed with perfect calm to the will of 
God.
Meher Baba who was silent for 
43 years dropped his physical 
body last Jan. 31 and thousands 
are in pilgramage to his tomb in 
Meherabad, India, anticipating his 
manifestation of love throughout 
the universe.
If you dont like the way people talk to each other, well pay you to change it.
Were in the communications business.
And during the next 30 years were going to upgrade all the equip
ment we now have in order to provide even better service to our 6 million 
existing customers.
As if that werent enough were also going to have to come up with 
enough new equipment to provide telephone service to about 26 million 
more people. As well as equipment for a much more extensive data com
munications program.
We need enough people (electrical, civil, mechanical and industrial 
engineers, designers, accountants and economists) to plan, design, build 
and operate a company that will be four times bigger than we are today. 
We also need engineers, researchers and scientists to develop electronic 
switching equipment, laser and other communications systems well be 
using 10,25 and 50 years from now.
But this is only one part of our communications business.
Our Sylvania people, for example, are involved in other types of 
communications. Like color television sets, satellite tracking stations 
and educational television systems.
Automatic Electric, Lenkurt, Ultronic Systems and some of our other 
companies, subsidiaries and divisions are working on advanced types of 
integrated circuitry, electro-opticals and communications systems be
tween people and computers and between computers and computers.
So if you think you have something to say about the way people talk 
to each other... we're ready to listen.
