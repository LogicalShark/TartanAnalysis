Yacoe Wins S.G. Presidential election
JIn the recent election held to fill the 
post of Student Government President and 
twelve student senate seats, Peter Yacoe, a 
junior Chemical Engineering student was 
elected President. In all, Yacoe received 
44.7% of the 586 votes (13% of the s 
student body) cast for president. (He won 
in every college except CFA, where David 
Roussos, came in second with 26.4% of the 
vote. Larry Valery received 19.1% and Don 
Simon received 9.8%. The new senators by 
constituency are: CFA: Betsy Lynn
Klompus, Jeff Dayton, Mark Steinberg and
Clancy Martin; CIT: Elliot Popowitz, Bob 
Tekach, Sandra Lani and Robert Brown; 
Ams: Lorraine Wilson; MIS: Mark Koshute, 
and Mary Jo Chabala; H&SS: Steve LaffertyYacoes plans for Senate year include 
revising the constitution to get rid of 
ambiguities and inconsistencies. He also 
plans to ask the Board of Trustees to pro
vide more adequate laboratory, art and li
brary facilities. He feels that the athletic 
department should be a little more open 
about who they found. To help alleviate
student apathy, Yacoe feels that the Stud
ent Government President should get paid 
as well as the Senate Chairperson. When 
questioned about paying other people who 
participate in student organizations such as 
the TARTAN and WRCT, Yacoe said, 
basically apathy lies in senate. The paper
and WRCT dont seem to have that prob
lem.
Yacoe plans to appoint Jim Puder, a 
junior Civil Engineering major to the pos
ition of Assistant to the President. Puder is, 
according to Yacoe, a very close friend.
When questioned about specific qualifica
tions that Puder has, Yacoe stated that 
Puder likes to get involved and  is quite 
adequate for the job.
... Roussos Contests Election
by Joan Konkle
David Roussos, who came ir second in 
the election for president of student gov
ernment, is contesting that election. In a 
petition he and his supporters distributed 
Friday, he claims that the election laws 
were violated five times.
The most important violations he says 
occurred involve Article I, Section 1, of 
the Student Senate bylaws, which states 
that the president of student government 
shall be elected in a general campus elec
tion. This law was violated in three ways, 
according to Roussos.
The first is that students were improp
erly informed of the election. Student 
Senate did very little to advertise the elec
tion and make the issues and candidates 
known. The only opportunity the candi
dates had to express their views to the stu
dents was at an unpublicized WRCT pro
gram.
The second alleged violation is that 
polls were improperly designated and ar
ranged. In one case, the person in charge 
of the polls is said to have looked just like 
someone studyingthere was little evidence that an election was taking place. 
The third is that the polls were not open 
when they should have been. At the H&SS
and GSIA polling places the elections end
ed early, and other polls too were possibly 
closed down during hours designated for 
voting.
The other two violations the petition 
mentions is that a candidate spent more 
than the allowed $40 on his campaign, and 
that campaigning occurred within a 20 foot 
radius of the polls, which is not permitted.
In order to gain student support for his 
cause, Roussos held a meeting of interested 
students on Sunday afternoon. The peti
tions he circulated on Friday were signed 
by 150 people. Many more signatures were 
taken at the rallies held at Morewood and 
Skibo Monday afternoon, while. Roussos
was presenting his case, and the petitions 
he already had, to Student Senate at their 
regular Monday meeting.
Roussos is aware that his actions might 
make him look like a poor loser trying to 
get a second chance. He denies this, saying 
that he isnt sure he would win in a second 
election. He believes that since the major 
issue of his candidacy was ending injustice 
in student government, he must protest the 
election he feels is unfair, regardless of his 
chances for winning in a second election. 
Nonetheless, he said that the margin (265- 
155) between Peter Yacoe, the winner, and 
him would definitely be much, much clo
ser.
Peter Yacoe, newly elected S.G. President
Although Peter Yacoe, the newly elect
ed president signed the petition, when he was 
contacted by the TARTAN, his comment 
was, David Roussos is friend of mine. If 
he wants to contest the election, its his 
business. I think hes wasting his time. Al
though the Senate constitution does not 
state specific grounds for appeal, it does 
detail an appeals board that can be con
vened to decide disputed elections. In spite 
of this, Yacoe said It( the election) wont 
be appealed... all they can do is declare a 
candidate ineligible. I havent done any
thing illegal.

This year thirty-eight clubs and organi

the activities fees paid by the students at

I CMU is not the only school that waives 
athletics applications fees. This policy is an 
accepted practice by other PAC schools.
Raymond Haynes, CMUs Athletic Di
rector for nine years prior to Jim Banners 
arrival from Pitt, stated, One way or an
other Im sure all schools do it.
When asked whether such a practice was 
considered a violation of the PAC rule pro
hibiting preferential treatment for prospec
tive athletes, Haynes replied, If any 
school considers waiving the application 
fee as a preferential treatment, then that 
would mean a lot of things. Many schools 
in the PAC would be violating the rule in 
some form. Haynes -went on to say that 
while he was Athletic Director there was a 
meeting of all the PAC athletic directors. 
During the meeting, they were asked if 
Chtb3tli1 ht rs5i i356b
proposed budget carefully, cutting where 
they think is necessary. In some cases they 
approve of a budget larger than what was 
requested if they think of some additional 
items that should be included. 95% of the 
clubs have turned in their proposals. A 
total of $102,036 was requested. At this 
point in time $96,409 has been granted. 
This is decided upon the basis of need and 
how much money they have to spread 
around.
The largest allocation by far is the Acti
vities Board. They received $41,100 (as 
compared to the next largest, the TAR
TAN, who received $11,995). AB added 
another $20,000 to this through ticket
sales and other miscellaneous income. 
The Activities Board receives such a large 
share of the pie because of the many things 
for which they are responsible. They will 
sponsor, for this budget period, 62 movies, 
(2 of which are free), 7 programs (lectures 
and special events), 6 concerts (4 are free), 
the Honors Colloquiem, 4 large T.G.I.F.s 
and several coffeehouses.
The next largest spender is the TAR-* 
TAN which receives $11,995 from the 
Student Senate who is also able to add 
$12,000 in advertising fees. The majority 
of the money goes to pay the printing and 
photography costs.

Science and Tech Forum Held
PIoESx nuoSEcum S?2P ESPEw? Urs5i d
by Mark Aksoy
On Wednesday, March 31, the last in a 
series of forum discussions on Science. 
Technology, and Human Values was held 
in the Wherret Room. The evenings topic 
bore the general title of Computing and 
Thinking with emphasis on the growing 
vulnerability of peoples self-image to in
creasingly sophisticated generations of 
computers. The participants included Allen 
Newell, CMU Professor of Computer Sci
ence, and a panel consisting of Pamela McCorduck, Professor English at Pitt, Carl 
Strome, Pastor of the First Bapist Church, 
and Herbert Toor, Dean of CIT.
The main speaker, Allen Newell, had a 
potentially hopeful outlook and referred to 
Count Rumford, who contributed to mod
ern thermodynamic theory by his observa
tions on heat flow in the boring of cannon, 
itself a purely military operation. In this, 
Newell saw a parallel with the computer, 
since what has been learned through specif
ic computer design has similarly yielded a
general theory, that of information proces
sing, which can be applied to the larger 
field of man and machine. Thus, the long
term effect of the computer will lie not so 
much in its problem-solving capabilities as 
in the insight it offers into the human 
mind. Newell defined self-image as a collec
tive view of humanity as a whole, and for 
the most part confined himself to raising 
problems inherent in deciding how the 
computer would affect it. Self-images were 
seen as semi-conjectural stories used to 
close wide gaps in our knowledge of ulti
mate questions. In our present day, they 
exist in a great multitude, conceiving of 
man as everything from brute animal to 
Gods special creation, and can be influ
enced somewhat by scientific discoveries. 
Given their number and tentative nature, 
the problem of determining how comput
ers influence self-image becomes a confu
sing one.

al view, concentrating on the individual

An Interesting Sidelight
An interesting sidelight of the recent Student Senate 
Presidential Elections was the endorsement of one of the 
four candidates by the Carnegie Commuter Council of Pitts
burgh (CCCP).
The CCCP; which sent out its only mailer of the year just 
in time for the elections, endorsed the winning candidate 
Peter Yacoe on the grounds that he is a commuter. Although 
this might seem to be a legitimate criteria, it fails to account 
for the fact that three out of the four candidates were 
commuters and one of them had been very active in com
muter affairs.
What is the CCCP and what right does it have to use its 
CMU status (a privledge expressly forbidden the candidates) 
to make political endorsements? The current CCCP officers 
were elected earlier this year in an election which had very 
low commuter participation. Essentially, there was no publi
city before the election. The CCCP is the least known and 
least active of the three student government bodies on cam
pus.
Thus, the CCCPs legitimacy is highly questionable. The 
possibility exists that it consists mostly of a group of stu
dents (Chemical Engineers) who have abused their positions 
to support their personal friend, another Chemical Engineer.
The ramifications of this action to the integrity of the 
election are evident. For example, all the candidates are given 
a campaign spending ceiling of $40.00. The cost of the 
mailing exceeded this amount. Although this expense was 
incurred by the CCCP and not the candidate, the question 
does exist whether, given the history of the CCCP, this 
ought not to be considered a direct campaign expenditure.
The candidates are also forbidden to represent themselves 
as Student Government or Carnegie -Mellon University. Al
though University policy is that only recognized University 
organizations are to be allowed access to the computer ad
dress labels of the student body, the Commuter Council 
made use of this service.
It might be said that a candidate should not be held 
responsible for the actions of his supporters. However, 
the current U.S. Election Code explicitly states that the 
candidate is accountable for his supporters contributions. 
Furthermore, Mr. Yacoe was told in advance of the CCCPs 
support and had the opportunity to abort it.
I am in no way attacking the integrity of Mr. Yacoe 
or his ability to serve as the President of Student Govern
ment. What i am suggesting is that as a result of the financial 
contributions made to his campaign by the Commuter 
Council, Mr. Yacoe had an unfair political advantage over his 
opponents; an advantage which might have been the catalyst 
of his recent victory.
Student Senate should exercise its authority and question 
the legitimacy of the CCCP. It would seem that this organiza
tion is operating in direct violation of Student Government 
directives if it (1) subverts the election process; and (2) does 
so with the use of Student Activities Fee Funding. Any or
ganization which fails to provide service to its constituents 
and at the same time does damage to the existing systems on 
campus deserves serious review.

Pitts View
Editor:
The Pittsburgh Hockey Invi
tation Tournament scheduled 
for March 13 and 14, 1976 had 
to be cancelled because the Carnegie-Mellon Hockey Team with
drew from the tournament on 
March 8, 1976. It was to feature 
teams from CMU, Pitt, Penn 
State and Westchester, Pennsyl
vania and financed ($1,600) by 
CMU and Pitt. The Pitt Hockey 
Club had contracted with the 
Civic Arena and was to bill CMU 
for 50% of the contract. Howev
er, CMU was not asked to sign 
a contract because we had work
ed this arrangement in past 
tournaments with your school 
and others without a problem. 
Besides, I personally know the 
CMU Chib coordinators and had 
faith and trust in their word.
I tried to get several other 
teams to replace CMU, but a few 
days notice was not enough 
time. Thankfully, because of our
relationship with the Civic Arena 
people, we were able to cancel 
the contract and play Penn State 
in a game on March 14. We had 
to work fast and hard to avoid a 
financial crisis.
Im certain the game between 
CMU and Pitt on March 7, 1976 
was the prime reason for this 
situation. The game was called in 
the third period because of sev
eral fights on the ice. CMU and 
Pitt hockey games are heated 
rivalries and both teams can be 
blamed for these misconducts. 
However, tempers flare in all 
sports where there is a keen ri
valry.
The evening after the March 
7, 1976 game, I received a tele
phone call from one of the CMU 
Club coordinators stating their 
hockey team was withdrawing 
from the tournament. I attempt
ed to change his mind and re
minded him of the $ 1,600 con
tract with the Civic Arena. I 
even promised to have the game 
scheduled so that CMU and Pitt 
would not play each other. He
stated the CMU Team did not 
want to be associated with Pitt. 
I reminded him this cancellation 
could hurt college hockey at the 
Arena. He stated the team had 
decided to cancel and he 
couldnt take it upon himself as 
spokesman to reverse that deci
sion.
I have learned one lesson 
from this experience and that is 
to make certain any future 
agreements are in writing. I feel 
the CMU Team acted in an irre
sponsible and hasty manner, da
maging the trust and faith our 
hockey club had in them for the 
past several years. However, I do 
not feel the actions of the team 
reflect on the club coordinators 
but on the club as an entity.

the Hockey Club throughout the 
year as to why we did not par
ticipate in the season-ending 
tournament with Pitt. As the 
readers may or may not know, 
the March 7 CMU-Pitt game end
ed in the middle of the third per
iod when we left the ice follow
ing an all-out brawl. Hockey is a 
violent game, and temper flareups are inevitable. After a few 
choice words and a shove or 
two, though, cooler heads usual
ly prevail and the teams resume 
the playing of a hockey game, 
which is the reason they have 
agreed to be on the ice in the 
first place. CMU-Pitt games have 
been notorious for the lack of 
agreement on this fundamental 
point. Pitts bush league tactics 
may not be out of place on Sat
urday night wrestling, but they 
certainly do not belong on a 
hockey rink. The games have de
generated into a series of skir
mishes, culminating in the 
March 7th battle.Pitt has repeatedly 
demonstrated that they would 
rather fight than play hockey, so 
with few regrets, our team voted 
unanimously to withdraw from 
the tournament and tell Pitt 
they had better find some new 
sparring partners for next year.
Im sorry our season ended 
on such a bitter note, but at 
least the air is cleared for future 
seasons. I would like to thank 
the people who stuck with the 
team through this lean year; 
thanks also to Mrs. Cox, who has 
been very helpful to the team. 
We hope to return to our win
ning ways next year by playing 
better hockey, and not by quick
ening our punches and sharpen
ing our elbows.
Michael Gallaway 
CMU Hockey Club
Position Reassessed 
Editor:
In your recent editorial We 
the Class of 76 you attributed 
a number of attitudes and ac
tions to CMUs Development of
fice. As a member of the Devel
opment staff, I am disturbed to 
learn that I and my colleagues 
are identified merely as a physi- . 
cal location. Let me identify 
myself as one of the individuals 
to whom your editorial was di
rected. I am also a alumnus, 
having graduated in 1971, so Id 
like to think that the remarks 
I make below are the reflections 
of an individual who has had an 
opportunity to look at the Uni
versity from the dual perspec
tives of student and staff mem
ber. With this background in 
mind, I would like to make four 
comments and raise one ques
tion.
First, the program itself was 
organized solely by an ad hoc 
committee of Senior Class mem
bers. The only function that in
dividuals from the Development 
office performed was to serve as 
advisors in the logistics and 
methodology of organizing such 
a program. At no time did the 
University commit itself to put
ting on such a program whether 
or not the students cared for it. 
Frankly, the involved students 
see the program as a good vehi
cle for initiating change here at 
CMU.
Second, in no respect are 
these funds to be spent by the 
University administration. All 
contributions over the five-year 
program period will be placed 
into a special holding account. 
At the end of this period, those 
contributing members of the
____________________/ -
Class of 76 will jointly deter
mine the application of these 
funds. I emphasize that partici
pating members /of the class will 
spend their contributions; the 
University will hot.
Third, the fund provided by 
President Cyert, which was des
cribed in y Int editorial, encom
passes a number of programs. 
There is no mandate to spend 
these funds (bn a Senior Gift Pro
gram. Indeed, the Development 
staff is not obliged to spend any 
of these funds. They were pro
vided by Dr. Cyert solely for the 
purpose of enabling the Univer
sity to underwrite new programs 
of special virture, such as the 
Senior Gift Program. Had the or
ganizing ad hoc committee of 
Seniors so chosen, the program 
would have been abandoned, 
and the modest funds necessary 
to conduct it would have re
mained unspent.
Fourth, in my personal opin
ion the number of signers of this 
Declaration who are not Seniors 
indicates to me that students 
from all classes are interested in 
having a direct influence on how 
money gets spent here at CMU. 
Freshmen, sophomores, and jun
iors must feel that this program 
represents a valid opportunity 
for them to make their voices 
heard as they reach their own 
senior years, or they would not 
have added their names.
And finally my question. 
Why is it that no member of the 
TARTAN Editorial staff made 
any attempt which I can discern 
to contact any member of the 
Universitys Development staff? 
We certainly would have been 
willing to accomodate your 
questions, and then let you draw 
your own conclusions. This rela
tively simple step might have
I have continued the practice 
of having lunch once a month 
with a group of students, ran
domly selected from the student 
body. There are between ten and 
fifteen students present. Among 
other things, I usually ask foi 
suggestions as to how I can in
crease my communications with 
the student body.
At the last lunch, the stu
dents present gave me a number 
of good suggestions. In particu
lar, several thought that it would 
be a good idea for me to meet 
students yin an informal setting, 
such as'lounges, studio classes, 
and intramural events. Dean 
Swank and I did some visiting a 
week ago Friday. I had the op
portunity to meet a number of 
Fine Arts students in their col
lege. I intend to do more of this 
and hope to be able to talk di
rectly to a number of you. I am 
concerned with finding out your 
problems in relation to the uni
versity and, in particular, to find 
out how we can better serve the 
student body. I am interested in 
your reaction to your education 
and to the environment that we 
are providing on the campus and
made it possible to avoid the in
accurate conclusions (a) that Dr. 
Cyert was the force behind the 
program instead of the seniors, 
and (b) that the program was it
self a vehicle for obtaining funds 
to be spent in any fashion so de
termined by the administration. 
If you had taken such investiga
tive steps before writing your 
editorial, I believe you would 
have found it necessary to reas
sess your position.

are problems about which I can 
do very little. Nevertheless, I 
want to know what is on your 
mind with respect to CMU.
Black Students
I had the opportunity to 
peak to the black students on 
March 8. This was part of the ac
tivities going^ on during Black 
Week. I found the experience 
stimulating and want to congra
tulate our black students on the 
excellent set of activities they 
developed. I was sorry that so 
few white students were present. 
I am still concerned, and ex
pressed that concern to the stu
dents at my talk, about the rela
tionships between blacks and 
whites on campus. I would like 
to see less isolation on the part 
of both groups and more interac
tion. I firmly believe that we 
have the opportunity to develop 
ways on this campus in which 
black and white students can 
come to know each other better 
as people. The simple notion of 
people relating to each other as 
people is still one that is lacking 
throughout a good part of our 
society as we have seen recently 
in the busing issue. I have tried 
a variety of devices to get more 
ideas on approaches that we
might take on the campus. I am 
now asking Dean Swank to chair 
a committee that will be com
posed of faculty and students, to 
study the problem of race rela
tions on the campus and to give 
me some more ideas on what we 
can do to improve everyones 
ability to live with different cul
tures both on the campus and 
off the campus. I consider this 
problem a significant one and 
would like to see this University 
provide a leadership role for 
other schools.

The Carnival Tradition
by Sue Murtha
In the beginning, Andrew Carnegie 
founded a school called Carnegie Tech. 
Carnegie Tech had one great untapped 
resource (not to be overlooked by the 
industrous Andrew), and that happened 
to be the alumi. And not only were those 
alumni scattered all over the country, but 
they were making MONEY - and they 
werent sending their revenues to him. 
With that in mind, Andrew Carnegie creat
ed a three-day extravaganza call ed Campus 
Week, which would invite all the alumni 
back for reunions and give them a chance 
to see what the college was accomplishing. 
Besides all these activities, there were the 
traditional ceremonies which now seem a 
world away.
The major part of this traditon was di
vided into three parts: Qualification Day,
the Carnegie Class Chain and Call Day. 
Qualification Day was the big event of 
freshman year in which the Plebes 
(freshman, of course), who had made it 
through the rigors and regulations of their 
first year, rose from the downtrodden 
ranks to become duly authenticated mem
bers of the Carnegie Clan. Part of this cere
mony involved the welding of a new link 
to the Carnegie Class Chain, by the head 
instructor of the Forge Shop, who would 
dress up as Vulcan (the god, not Mr. Spock 
- remember, this is 1920). Standing over 
a portable forge, he welded a blank link to 
the chain, the link later being inscribed 
with the class numerals in their senior 
year.
Immediately after the forging of the 
link, Call Day was held on the athletic 
field. This was the time when the honor
ary fraternities would finally announce
Midway Opens with a Bang !
by John McGrow

Gail Netzlof, Midway Chairperson, of the 
opening of Spring Carnival. At 5:30, this

A number of competitions will be going 
on this Friday afternoon, as a part of 
Spring Carnival. The annual gazorching 
contest-water balloon battle will take place 
on the cut at 2:00. The gazorching teams, a 
three member-team whose equipment in
cludes long pieces of surgical rubber and 
water balloons, will be judged on distance 
and accuracy. Immediately following will 
be a water balloon free-for-all, where 
balloon battlers will be able to take out 
their hostilities. While the water balloon 
battle will probably see no clear-cut win
ners, Linda Levi, organizer of these events, 
promised champagne and cold duck 
for the gazorching victors.
The six-person team events will begin 
on the football field at 1:00. The teams 
will participate in five different field 
events.
In the Six-Person Pyramid, each team 
simultaneously begins construction of a 
pyramid. Before the sixth person can climb 
to the top, he or die must shake hands 
with the bottom layer of the pyramid, and, 
if it collapses, the team must start all over 
again. The first team to hold a six person 
pyramid for twenty seconds, wins.
In the Water Balloon Toss, teams line 
up with three persons at the starting line
Muddy Fun
by David Matthews
Hey is your idea of having fun a team 
pillow fight over a pool of mud? Well, if 
this interests you go immediately to the 
nearest mental institution and ask to be 
committed. First, however, you might nur
ture this odd desire by entering either the 
Plank Joust or the tug of war at Spring 
Carnival 76 on Saturday, April 10. The 
plank jousting is at 1:30 pm. Here a team

to. The second person tosses out a water 
balloon, to be caught by the first person 
without breaking, while the third person is 
running out ahead of the first, trying to 
catch the next toss. The three people pro
ceed all the way to the other line in this 
manner. If a balloon breaks, they must 
start over. When the other line is reached, 
the trio there must return in the same 
fashion. A person holding a balloon may 
take NO steps. The winning team is the 
first one to toss a balloon across the 
original starting line and have the appropWhen tne bout begins each sickie slaps the 
other chap (his opponent) silly with a pil

one of the poor slobs fall into the pit (no, 
not Skibo dining hall, I mean the other 
grimy gorge). When only five members are 
remaining upright (or semi-erect) on the 
planks the match is over. If, however, the 
contest exceeds the one minute time per
iod, and two struggling adversaries are left 
lacking horns on the same plank, a draw 
will be called. The teams will attempt to be 
matched according to height and weight.

sudden death competition.
The tug of war will proceed at 3:00 pm 
at the same spot over the same lovely pool. 
Each team will have five members (alive if 
possible). One team will stand on one side 
of the pit, the other team on the other 
side. Then with all their might each team 
tries to pull the other entire team into the 
pit. Once a member releases his (or her) 
grip, they may not regrab the rope (but 
must remove all their clothing and rub 
ministrone soup over their entire bodies). 
When an entire team is submerged in the 
mire, and only the yellows of their teeth 
show the match is over, the remaining team 
being the winner.
Prizes of beer will be given to the win
ners at both contests which will take place 
on the top of the hill between the Beta frat 
house and Doherty Graduate House. 
Theres plenty of room for spectators with 
nothing better to do and who are possessed 
with latent voyeurist tendencies. Entering 
again this year will be the Roaches, last 
years champs trying to hang on to their 
crown as the reigning wierdos at CMU. The 
teams may be coed and comprised of any 
CMU inmate (faculty, student, that dog 
that is always running around inside of Ski
bo, etc.) If you wish to gain a more favor
able competing position, sign up your crew 
before Saturday at Skibo.
Zambelli will unleash an Atomic Bomb 
(a rather large firecracker) to start off the 
festivities with the proverbial BANG!
Along with the previously announced
8 to 10 rides, which will be situated at the 
Beeler St. end of the parking lot and in 
the main parking lot, there will be the 
WRCT broadcast truck, the A Phi O and 
CWEN concessions and the 20 game booths
* in competiton. WRCT, as usual, will be 
providing music for the entire midway, 
with its Sound of Spring Carnival 76. They 
are planning to broadcast Sweepstakes and 
are thinking of having some freebees.
12 fraternities, 5 sororities and 3 inde
pendents (Spirit, SDC and Hockey Club) 
will be reresented along the midway in 
the booth competition. This years theme is 
American Cities, and each both is de
picting a town or city in the United States. 
SAE is in San Fransico, KS is in Las Vegas, 
BTPis going to be in Bugtusle, DUs shoot
ing for Dodge City and ATO is heading for 
Milwaukee. Construction on the booths 
will begin Monday, and they will open on 
Thursday.
This years judging of the booths will 
take place Thursday evening and Friday 
afternoon. There will be trophies award
ed to first, second and third in the fratern
ity booth competition; first and second in 
the sorority booth competition; and first 
in the independent booth competition. 
Each booth is judged twice by each of five 
judges. The areas that the booths will be 
judged in are: Adherence to the theme, 
Uniqueness of game, Appearance, Engi
neering, and Enjoyability.
The announcement of the winners and 
presentation of the trophies will be on Sat
urday, April 10. The 10:30 ceremony will 
be in the tent in the stadium area, immedi
ately before the SDC dance.

the wealthy alumni, were aghast. Trouble 
started during the performance of the play 
during Campus Week, and the police were 
called in. Unfortunately, the police action 
culminated in dormitory raids and the 
student body replied in the timeless man
ner of all student bodies -- smoke bombs.
After the fiasco of 1927, Campus Week 
became a small, alumni-run affair in which 
the students had very little chance to 
participate. The tradition of Campus Week 
was revived in 1930 when students flocked 
to a Student Government poll to pledge 
their support. After a few revisions to pre
vent occurances like that in 1927, Campus 
Week returned, this time under student 
management and with the new name of 
Spring Carnival.
Major changes in the basic structure of 
Campus Week and Carnival were made as 
the social ideas and composition of the uni
versity altered. When women were admit
ted to Margaret Morrison College, the Carn
ival Queen program began. It gained more 
importance in the 1950s with the addition 
of Varsity Varieties, the sororities skits to 
present their respective candidates. 1969 
saw the last of the Spring Carnival Queens 
(as well as the old-time tradition, Call 
Day).
A float parade following a definite 
theme had been an integral part of the fes
tivities for many years, but due to lack of 
parading space, was curtailed and finally 
cut altogether in 1955. Emphasis was then 
placed on the Midway, which had been a 
collection of games, booths and a few 
rides, to try and make it more colorful 
and exciting. Trophies were awarded on be
half of this effort, first to fraternities, 
then later to sororities and independents. 
The Midway has continued to expand and 
be more competitive every year with such 
themes as Main Street, USA, Ye Olde 
Game Shoppe, and Great Movies. 
There have always been games and contests 
at Spring Carnival, ranging from canoe
jousts on Panther Hollow Pond (1938) 
to frisbee (1970s). There have been dances 
and concerts with current big names in 
popular music - Woody Herman to the 
Righteous Brothers. There have always 
been plays, since 1948 all original musicals
performed by Scotch n Soda. Last but not 
least, there has always been Sweepstakes, 
(the buggy races), for 50 years. It really 
makes you wonder - did Andrew Carnegie 
have the slightest idea of what he was geting into?
O6i Pk3ee ?-C6st5i
by Rosie Dauer
Four CMU students have been selected 
to participate in the undergraduate ex
change program with Ecole Polytechnic 
Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzer
land for students in engineering and ap
plied science. LEPFL is situated on the 
shores of Lake Geneva in the French-speak
ing section of Switzerland.
Diane Griffin (Applied Math), Veronica 
Magyar (Chem.E.), Stefan Fox (Civ.E. & 
P.A.) and Michael Candlish (E.E.) will be 
representing a program < establishing the 
first international exchange between engin
eering schools in the United States on a 
formal basis.
Academic departments within LEPFL
comparable to those at CIT, the only dif
ference being that the classes at LEPFL 
are organized somewhat like mini-courses, 
and it might take three or four of these 
mini-courses to equal a nine unit class at 
CMU (Veronicas sum total of courses is 
eleven).
While the engineering students are on 
the same level, the applied math depart
ment is a year to a year and a half more ad
vanced than CMU (Diane will be taking 
mostly freshman and sophomore courses).
The basic reason for participation in this 
program is the desire to see another coun
try and another method of education. 
While Diane and Steve will be taking al
most entirely technical subjects, Mike and 
Veronica are looking forward to taking
CMU's half of next year's exchange prog
closely resemble those within CIT. Empha
sis is on engineering and applied science 
rather than on pure science. While there is 
no assigned homework and tests are given 
on an oral basis, students attend class from
8 am to 5 pm, with the 4 pm hour sched
uled for humanities courses.
Most of the engineering courses are
ram. ( with Professor C.L. Bauer, Center)
non-technical courses such as music and 
art. The main concern of the students is 
their limited knowledge of French. (They 
have all studied for somewhere between 
two and five years.) All students are study
ing French on a programmed basis to pre
pare them for the lectures, which will be 
given in that language.gREGISTRATION PROCEDURES

persons reaction to the thinking machine. 
She alluded to Marlowe in Conrads Heart 
of Darkness, who felt thrilled and terrified 
by the native societies of the African in
terior, as much by their new morality as by 
their existence in a totally free state, po
tentially menacing to the white European. 
Marlowe thus typifies Western man en
countering an alien intelligence, yet Ms. 
McTorduck confessed never having felt

Professor Allen Newell
fears toward the computer and indeed pro
jected an eagerness to accept it as intellec
tual superior if need be. She referred to Ca
tos statement on the menace of women to 
society, comparing it with todays popular 
opinion regarding computers and went on 
to say that most self-images emphasizing 
mans uniqueness in the universe were in 
reality made by and for the male half of 
humanity. Woman has implicitly been left 
out of the uniqueness equation. If this was 
the image of Man that computers were 
threatening, then perhaps it was all for the 
better, in McCorducks view, for as a wom
an she was as much a threat to that image as 
the thinking machine itself.
Reverend Strome, of all speakers, came 
closest to playing the role of devils advo
cate in the forum. He downgraded the al
leged capabilities of computers, insisting 
that they should be considered examples of 
artificial memory as opposed to artifical in
telligence. However, he concentrated on 
showing how far computers were from re
sembling real human personalities, rather 
than whether they could simply evolve into 
superior thinking machines. Could we pro
gram a computer to hope or hate, he asked. 
Even assuming you could instill human 
qualities, would you then still have a relia
ble computer? For example, he hypothe
sized that a computer programmed to love 
might fall in love with its programmer, cre
ating a welter of problems. To Strome, the 
essence of the human psyche still lays en
shrouded in mystery with man retaining a 
measure of self-uniqueness by virture of 
the three pounds of gray matter in his 
skull.
Dean Toor tended to agree with Dr. 
Newell in that the advent of computers 
would shed new light on the problem of 
the human mind. He also observed that 
much of the fear computers engender

among humanists perhaps stems from the 
whirlwind pace of scientific change. Unless 
an intense and continuous effort is made to 
keep informed, one can become uncertain 
of the true capabilities and limitations of 
new developments. As regards the problem 
of maintaining ones personal self-image in 
the face of the superior machine, Dean 
Toor remarked that such a situation has al
ways existed between people. Nearly every
one encounters his intellectual superior 
sometime in life and usually allows for the 
others intelligence but simultaneously real
izes or rationalizes superior abilities within
himself in some different area of expertise, 
thereby salving his ego. u similar modus vivendi might result between man and ma
chine.
The participants each approached the 
topic from a different angle. For different 
reasons, none of them saw the computer as 
posing a real threat to mans spiritual sense 
of self or well-being. On this point there 
was an implied unanimity that such fears, 
at least for now, are exaggerated, and one 
can only wonder if centuries hence com
puters will ever develop the same fears to
ward their human creators.

their respective universities waived appli
cation fees for athletes. Many schools con
firmed such a practice. I know Allegheny 
and Bethany do it, Haynes commented.
William Elliot, Vice-Provost for Enroll
ment Planning, stated that he would not 
have this policy at CMU if it wasnt for the 
fact that everyone else is doing it. Were 
keeping up with the competition, Elliot 
stated.
Jim Banner, CMUs Athletic Director, 
was asked how prospective athletes found 
out that they dont have to pay the appli
cation fee. He replied, If they ask, we tell 
them they dont have to pay the fee. He 
was then asked if coaches were told to tell 
prospective students that they dont have 
to pay the fee. He responded, The 
coaches dont have instructions . . . They 
just do it. However, when Haynes was 
asked whether he knew of any coaches dur
ing his time as Athletic Director that told 
athletes that CMU would take care of their 
application fees, he answered, No way. 
Never even talked about it.
Both Haynes and Banner felt that such a 
practice was not in violation of the PAC 
ruling concerning preferential treatment, 
but their reasoning centered around the 
fact that other schools are actively engag
ing in this practice.
If they started lowering the standards
for entrance requirements for athletes, 
then this would be preferential treatment, 
Haynes explained.

a.m. Saturday, CMU will take on PS at 6 
p.m., and the final match will be BU ver

Cummis, a leading force behind the newlyrecognized Ultimate Frisbee Team, hopes 
that at least twenty flayers will come from 
each school, and that they will be housed 
in Scobell for the weekend.
Another event sponsored by the Ulti

distance competition on Friday, open to 
anyone in the university who is interested. 
There wont be any advance sign-up, An

by L.S.D.C.
Friday morning at 7:00 am a 56-yearold Carnegie tradition will continue with 
the running of the 1976 Sweepstakes (the 
buggy races). The buggy races are a major 
part of Spring Carnival, and to some 
the only part. The preliminary races, con
sisting of eight heats with three buggies in 
each heat, will be run Friday morning, 
starting at 7:00 am. Saturday morning, at 
the same time, the finals will be run. The 
finals place the top six buggies of Fridays 
races against each other for the top spots. 
(The top three run for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
place, and the next three run only for 4th, 
5th, and 6th places.) In the event of rain 
on Friday, the preliminaries will be held on 
Saturday, and the finals will not be run.
The races are being started very early in 
the morning this year because of a conflict 
with the Pittsburgh Flower Show at Phipps 
Conservatory. The buggy course runs 
through the parking area for the Conserva
tory, and the flower show opens at 9:00 
am, so the races are being started at 7:00 
am in an effort to be finished by 9:00 or
9:30 am. This will free the parking area for 
use by flower show patrons and cause a 
minimum amount of inconvenience for ev
eryone involved.
The races this year should be very com
petitive. The freeroll part of the buggy 
course has been repaved since last years 
races, and this should help to ensure the 
fastest races ever. All of the traditional 
buggy racing powers have been rolling 
quite well during this springs freeroll pracby Gus Bivona
Six students currently attending CMU

winner, leading the pack. With a lot of or

was the new buggy fielded by the CIA.

Graduate Fellowships were awarded to 
550 students in the sciences, mathematics, 
and engineering. More than 5330 students 
competed for these NSF Fellowships. Also, 
the NSF accorded honorable mention to 
1980 applicants.
All of the fellowships carry a stipend of 
$3900 per year to cover full-time student 
living expenses. An education allowance of 
$3400 is provided by NSF to U.S. institu

As a rule, common attendance by my
self at student musicals is unheard of, un
less I am offered an appreciable amount of 
money. Most student-written musicals or 
shows I have seen are generally a collection 
of in-jokes known only to the author and 
his disciples, which leaves the larger por
tion of the audience to fend for them
selves in a shroud of mystery.
But the author of Glitz has man
aged to rise above this and present us with
actors was very good, thanks to Director 
Jan Kirschner. The overall pace went well, 
and everyone on stage knew who they were 
and what they were doing.
Basic tacky Hollywood musicals have 
sets which are usually no better, but I 
thought this set was a bit too basic and 
tacky. During the Brown Derby bar se
quences, the set was always shaking quite 
noticeably, and no set should be so dis
tracting as to cause the audience to gasp 
with horror as it is being changed. Set De
signer Dave Fisher had a nice idea, but it

a show everyone could enjoy. John Manganos book takes us to the soundstage of a 
tacky Hollywood musical where anything 
goes, including tasteless musicals made out 
of William Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida and Nathaniel Hawthornes The Scar
let Letter. The movie can be tasteless and 
tacky, but, as the show taches us, as long 
long as it has splash, tinsel, and glitz it will 
sell. Of course, no tasteless movie or show 
is complete without a trite love dilemma 
having the same characteristics. The author 
has included this as well.

The costumes designed by Dan Orlandi 
were a lot of fun. E especially liked the 
Caballeros costumes, which were quite fun

The choreography by Catherine MacNeal was well done camp. The dancing was 
executed in a way that caught the audience 
by surprise, making it enjoyable.
The acting company has worked hard 
on Glitz, and it shows. I dont want to 
single anyone out because it would be only 
personal preference. I would rather extend 
congratulations to the entire company.

SWEPT
Dedicated to Rick and Sarah, with much 
respect.
by Mark Evan Chimsky
Swept Away is a delightfully trans
parent little farce which the American pub
lic has turned into an awesomely dangerous 
Frankenstein of a film. The people in Lina
shuttles Raffaella out in a small motorboat 
for a cool hours worth of swimming. They 
lose their engine, as well as all sense of di
rection, and wind up washed ashore a 
leafy-green desert island. Director Wertmuller fuels this idyllic serendipity with that 
old cliche of a crowd-pleaser, the 
switched tables fantasy fulfillment: the 
lowly Gennarino has a go at thrashing,
x3ttsg3th x3stCsgyh x3stt3t3 rysDe e6i37 bh 'sg3sthiys 'iysbhGe Mskt3t5 osMMsiyysV
Wertmullers world are sexually active poli
tical cartoons, walking satirizations of capi
talist ennui and communist hypocrisy. 
Raffaella is the rich, tediously married Ita
lian bitch who virulently dismisses the 
working classes and concentrates on an
gling her way toward the best Mediterra
nean tan she can get. Gennarino, a peasant 
sailor, works Raffaellas yacht through 
the blue seas of August, resigning him
self to the ships meticulously leisured 
pace. One windy afternoon, Gennarino
kicking, and raping the lordly Raffaella 
into passionate submission.
Wertmuller begins mixing her metaphors 
early. Communism triumphs over Capita
lism in an act of frenzied, vengeful envy. 
Raffaella, the strident blonde capitalist 
uses docility as a strategic means toward 
survival. Wertmuller builds Gennarino up 
as the Lawrentian stud supreme, and with 
broad, easy strokes knocks the wind out of 
his greedy chauvinism. Like Lady Chatterly, Raffaella is the expensive female who is
exquisitely brought to life by a rough-andtumble roll in the hay by this working-class 
firebrand. What is peculiar (and perhaps 
baffling to most American film-goers) is 
that the sexual tug-of-war which is super
ficially central to the film hasnt really 
much to do with the film itself. Wertmuller 
is an ideologist; for her, sex is not as intrin
sically interesting as it is convenient in 
terms of representing a political metaphor.
That Raffaella is female complicates 
things immensely, and people tend to see 
Swept Away as a love story (ironically, 
the theater marquee is more accurate with 
its robustly sensational billing of the 
film as a bizarre romance.) With Gennarinos brutal humiliation of Raffaella, and 
the establishment of a cozy Female slave/ 
Male master set-up, Wertmuller forces her 
film into the territory of feminist polemics. 
Suddenly, its no longer about the hungry 
peasant, Gennarino, whos out to possess 
an Italian-dubbed version of the American 
Dream; the film becomes layered with uni
versalities and theres Wertmuller, the head 
chef, throwing around bits of Total Woman 
philosophy as if she were decorating a 
pizza.
It seems wrong-headed to read Ms. 
Wertmullers film too literally. What she 
says about men and women is laughably 
simplistic and damnably lacking in any 
kind of self-respect or pride. Raffaella is 
the idealized female eunuch, looking 
frighteningly happy about her reduced 
human status. This characterization is not 
so shocking as the publics acceptance of 
it. Many see the film as a continental-style 
love story, as if Fascist relationships were 
the marvelously new in thing this year. 
A female friend of mine says she under
stands Raffaellas grovelling as one of the 
most popular-and traditional-ways in 
which women can relate to men and that 
yes, despite all that self-effacement, its
still love. Wertmuller feeds us a lot of Vic
torian drivel about women and sacrifice, 
and like Victorian audiences, we nod and 
praise. Such mass complacency is ludi
crous, if not anachronistic, in this age of 
the Jongian raised consciousness.
The trouble with the popular reaction 
to Swept Away is a matter of laziness; 
that is to say, audiences are taking the film 
too seriously, without bothering to dig for 
any of Wertmullers spry, allegorical 
humor. With pedantic bravura (which 
seems a smart satirization of Wertmullers 
own tough Italian ethnicity), Swept 
Away elbows its way around the natural 
ironies of economic role reversal. The film 
isnt about love, its about the confused

UNDER
motives which trigger and convolute cor
ruption.
For Wertmuller, the Communists are 
raping the Capitalists in order to have the 
freedom to become just as maniacally op
portunistic and petty as their prey. Wert
mullers thesis is that given enough power, 
the working class would become all they 
have supposedly despised; that they would, 
in fact, con to be more tyrannical with 
leisure than the leisure class they have con
quered. Gennarino opts for rescue from the 
island in order to test Raffaellas devotion 
and to prove to a class-wracked culture 
that a common man might very well be 
able to command the loyalty and slavish 
worship of a lovelv aristocrat. He cues a
t
passing ship with a bonfire and arranges 
to be brought inland in a haplessly naive 
feat of wishful-thinking. For him, the 
ultimate victory would be to return to civi
lization with Raffaella wedged firmly un
der his thumb--he wants to sustain, and 
thus, perfect his own ragged pride of rich
es. His love is a question of economics. 
Gennarino sports a vision of his romance 
as being some glorious robbery of a rich 
mans wife. He aches for the wealth which 
lingers around Raffaella like a fiercely ob
trusive, and at the same time, enthralling 
perfume. But once home, Raffaella has the 
upper hand and she knows it will keep her 
bread buttered. For her, Gennarino be
comes merely an enlightening lay, a sort of 
buffoon King Midas for a day. When Gen
narino receives Raffaellas farewell note, 
Wertmuller inteijects, as if from out of the 
blue, a booming female voice flailing the 
air with her mordantly operatic keening. 
Wertmuller is burlesquing the high drama 
that floods Gennarinos eyes. He is tearing 
for a romantic ideal that is forever lost to 
him-the dream of the slave one-upping 
his master. Wertmuller apes the grand des
pair of classic love stories in a luxurious 
gesture of comic irony. Gennarino and 
Raffaella have not loved--they have not 
sought one another in the workaday light 
of their own humanity. Instead, they have 
simply treated themselves to an island of 
fantasies and heady indulgences. Gennarino 
runs out on his brawling wife, who seems 
to be all breasts and hands, in favor of 
the less authentic glamor of Raffaellas 
world. He does not relate to her, but to her 
power. His melodramatic sorrow at the end 
of the film springs more from eternal envy 
than from any sort of eternal love.
What is frightening is the conventional 
affection with which American audiences 
are receiving the film. On the surface, 
Swept Away is very much like those
brisk and bittersweet comedies of the for
ties, but without the heart. Wertmuller is a 
grossly hyperbolic social commentator (the 
first few scenes aboard Raffaellas yacht 
are shrilly, almost intolerably one-note). 
The director is at her best when mocking 
the limitations of her characters or taking 
pot-shots at the transparent romanticism of 
the films external plot. She is a slick direc
tor, who** films feel imnressive, despite
their rampant disarray of metaphors and 
glib insights. (I much prefer the quietly as
sured, wonderfully accomplished-though 
perhaps less ambitious--work of Joan Micklin Silver, the writer and director of Hes
ter Street ) Wertmuller has been bally - 
hooed out of all proportion by a public 
that is enchanted with Swept Away not 
as political fable, but as profound love
story. Raffaellas servitude is a male cnauvinists wish-come-true. To applaud this 
film as sublime romance is to encourage 
the inequitable machismo dream. The film 
stars Giancarlo Giannini as the charming, 
pathetically brutish Gennarino and Mariangela Melato as the droning bitch capitalist. 
In Italian-though the dubbed-English ver
sion playing here looks as if it were syn
chronized by a deaf-mute.

>seph Bartnicki would admit defeat at a match in Havanna.The Pittsburgh City Players opened 
their production of Toad of Toad Hall on 
March 21. This play, which will close on 
April 25, is the fifth production of the en
semble group. Housed in the Allegheny 
Community Theater of Carnegie Library in 
Allegheny Center, this group has brought 
free theater to Pittsburgh residents for a 
full year under sponsorship by the city De
partment of Parks and Recreation.
Marjorie Walker is the company director 
for the Pittsburgh City Players. She is 
pleased with the many accomplishments of 
the company, which has a core of only 
eight actors. The group has performed for 
various senior citizen groups and at many 
jcal high schools, in addition to regular 
iuties at its home theater. The acting com
pany provides classes for adults and child
ren on a regular basis.
The Pittsburgh City Players has avoided 
becoming an elitist grout. Ms. Walker beiieves that the theatei is like a Christ
mas tree. When peop; ..jnu ' > the theater, 
they all become the same. Old people, 
voung people, they come with expecta
tions. When the tree lights, it is the same 
for everybody. They bring different expec
tations, which result in different interpret
ations, but there are certain agreements an 
audience has which makes them laugh or 
cry. Theyre (the experiences) very special 
to each person, but they couldnt happen
to a person alone.
Ms. Walker tries to find plays with spe
cial qualities, and one of those is definitely 
Toad of Toad Hall Adapted from a novel 
by Kenneth Graham, the show doesnt fit 
any ofthe standard classifications of theat
rical productions. Slightly surrealistic, def
initely satirical, and containing pieces of 
fantasy, this is a unique entertainment ex
perience. The Toad of Toad Hall is not a 
musical, although there are songs in the 
show. The songs are very personal and in
tegral to the characters, not splashy, chorus 
ones that are found in musicals.
Toad of Toad Hall is the story of a 
charming toad who lives life as he pleases, 
taking what he wants from whoever has it. 
He is jailed by the other animals of society, 
but the toad escapes prison and gets re
venge on society. The trial scene is a satire 
on courts of all eras. The jury is comprised 
of hypocrites, and there are choruses of 
the toads supporters and opponents. The 
play reveals the injustices and preconceived 
notions present in most trials.
After Toad of Toad Hall, the Pittsburgh 
City Players hope to co-produce with the 
CMU Drama Department the Park Players 
summer program. Other possibilities in
clude presenting Fraijz Kafkas The Trial 
and a pantomime play called Tuesday. It 
should be interesting to watch the future 
of this enterprising company.
Chess masters have long been known for 
their eccentricities. Psychologists have 
credited them with everything from an 
Oedipus complex to meglomania. Paul 
Morphy, the unofficial U.S. world champion (1858-1859) retired at the age of 21, 
living the rest of his life as a paranoid rec
luse. He was given to oddities, such as ar
ranging womens shoes in a semi-circle and 
prancing around his veranda while reciting 
in French, the little king will go away un
abashed.
Wilhelm Steinitz, the world champion 
from 1886-1894, suffered from delusions. 
He claimed to be in contact with God, 
whom he offered a pawn handicap and the 
first move in a showdown chess match.
The world champion Alexander Alek
hine (1927-1935 and 1937-1946) was a 
Soviet expatriate who collaborated with 
the Nazis. He appeared at one chess ex
hibition and urinated *  n the floor.
Aron Nimzovich used to :and on his 
head between moves to keep the vital 
juices flowing.
Poor sportsmanship is also much in evi
dence. Joseph Blackburne, a British master, 
reportedly threw Steinitz out of a window 
after losing a game to him. Jose Capablanca 
(world champion from 1921 to 1927) had 
the room cleared of spectators before he

Actors from Community College and 
the community in general are working to
gether to present Dark of the Moon, an in
timate, yet intense fantasy in the captiva
ting setting of the Smokey Mountains. A 
Tennessee dialect adds color to the play 
and at times gives it the moving, poetic 
quality of a folk ballad. The story tells 
of a young witch boy who falls in love with 
a beautiful mountain girl. Their love is the 
object  of much fearful meddling by the 
superstitious townsfolk, resulting in vio
lence and tragedy for some.
The play, directed by Dr. Anne Youens 
of Community College, Allegheny Campus, 
with musical director, Chris Pignoli, will 
be the first public performance in the new 
College-Community Theater on the 5th 
floor of the library at Allegheny Campus, 
Ridge Avenue.
Performance dates are Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday, April 9, 10, 11, at 8:30 pm. 
Admission is free.
Sculpture by area artists will be shown 
in an exhibition called Sites: Public &
Private at the Arts and Crafts Center of 
Pittsburgh from March 27 through April 
18. The show, in two parts, is being spon
sored by the Society of Sculptors of 
Western Pennsylvania.
Exhibition category number I, called 
Sites: Public, will include entries to an 
open competition for monumental sculp
tures to be permanently placed on public 
Pittsburgh sites. Fred A. Myers, Director of 
the Grand Rapids Art Museum, chose 20 
models by 16 artists for public sites. The 
judge also selected four of the designs to be 
commissioned and fabricated full scale for 
permanent installation on designated loca
tions, subject to budget and safety limita
tions.
Exhibition category number II, called 
Sites: Private, will include sculptures for 
homes, offices and gardens. Mr. Myers 
chose 38 pieces by 30 artists for this sec
tion.
The Sites: Public project was planned 
by a committee headed by Aaronel deRoy 
Gruber, President of the Society of Sculp
tors with funds and City liaison achieved 
by a Three Rivers Arts Festival Committee. 
A grant from the Pennsylvania Council on 
the Arts, met by local donations and inkind materials and services with a combin
ed valued of approximately $30,000 is 
available for completion of the competi
tion winning sculptures. Mrs. Marshall 
Berkman and Mrs. Maurice Cerul are co-representatives for theThree Rivers Arts Fes
tival Committee and Douglas Pickering is 
exhibition chairman for the Society of 
Sculptors.
The Arts and Crafts Center, scene of the 
Sites: Public & Private show, is open to the 
public, free of charge, from 10-5 Tuesdays 
through Saturdays and from 2-5 Sundays 
(closed Mondays). The exhibition will be 
open until April 17.

by Michael S. Baurer
When the Bill of Rights was written, the 
first amendment to the Constitution guar
anteed to the American people, among 
other things, the right to freedom of the 
press. This right has undergone some sev
ere tests in our two-hundred year history. 
Possibly, this is because the term freedom 
of speech was never explicitly defined, 
but, like much of the Constitutions ver
biage, was left open to interpretation. Or 
possibly, the framers of the Constitution 
and Bill of Rights felt these words were 
sufficiently clear in their collective mean
ing that further explication of them was 
unnecessary. Regardless, we are stuck with 
them as they are, and the extent to which 
their application is justifiable is once again 
in question.
In its February 16 issue, the Village 
Voice, in defiance of a House resolution, 
printed extensive excerpts from the report 
by the House Intelligence Committee on 
the CIA. This represented another in a ser
ies of news leaks to the press by people 
in the governmental hierarchy. Drafts of 
the Intelligence Committees report had 
been previously leaked to a few news or
ganizations, such as The New York Times 
and CBS, apparently by one or more 
naughty Congressmen, and the information 
they contained was subsequently publi
cized. The House passed a resolution soon 
afterward prohibiting official release of the 
report until White House staff had an op
portunity to delete from it all classified 
material. But somehow, a complete draft 
was leaked to Daniel Schorr of CBS, which 
he later turned over to the Village Voice.
The Voice, in fact, was the only pub
lication willing to take the risk of printing 
his material. But Schorr had no intention of 
reaping the enormous profit which the ar
ticle could logically be expected to bring 
and asked instead that his share be turned 
over to the Reporters Committee for Free
dom of the Press, a small professional or
ganization operating out of Washington, 
D.C. In a letter to the editor of The New 
York Times, written February 16 and pub
lished the following Sunday, Schorr said, 
I found myself unexpectedly, because of 
a surprise action by the House, in posses
sion of possibly the only available copy of 
a report, bearing no classification on its 
face, its principle sensations already di
vulged, tied up in a confused parliamentary 
situation. My problem was that doing noth
ing would mean that I would be suppres
sing a report that might be interesting as a 
matter of public record. It had nothing 
more of national security significance, cer
tainly nothing that would endanger any in
dividual.
Schorrs reasons for doing what he did, 
for risking the contempt of Congress 
charges that some Congressmen are now 
endeavoring to bring against him, rest on 
his strong, albeit dogmatic, beliefs of what 
the press is and ought to be. The words 
freedom of the press imply more than 
simply the right of a paper to print or of a 
station to broadcast; they encompass the 
right of the people to know, to be aware 
of the realities and intentions of their gov
ernment, sinister or benign. Thus, a jour
nalist is confronted with a decision either 
to print or not to print, his first duty is to 
the public, although the responsibility for 
his actions is his own.
The leaking of government information 
admittedly poses a potential threat to the 
nations security. For the United States to 
remain a formidable contender in the sor
did geo-political game which characterizes 
our modern world, and which inescapably 
she must play, the need for secret foreign 
intelligence operations is unfortunate but 
real. Effectiveness in such operations al
most always depends on secrecy, and con
sequently, the people of this country can
not always be made aware of what their 
government is doing. However, much of 
what has leaked out has appalled us when 
stated national interests have conflicted sig
nificantly on moral, ethical, legal*, or prac
tical grounds with real national interests. 
When some of the covert CIA operations 
were exposed, such as those brought to 
light with the publishing of the Pentagon 
Papers, and we learned that the very agen
cy which had been founded and empow
ered for the purpose of protecting us was 
in fact often doing us more harm than 
good, the need for reform of defense poli
cies and practices became evident, and 
steps began to be taken against corrupt 
State Department practices. Leakage then 
was beneficial, for it made us aware of 
what our government was doing without 
our consent.
There is a fine line between those sec
rets which are advantageous to leak to the 
public and those which are not. It remains 
the governments esponsibility to prevent 
vital secrets from escaping into the press. 
President Ford recently called for a joint 
intelligence oversight committee in Con
gress which would oversee United States 
intelligence activities and ostensibly work 
towards the prevention of information 
leaks. In the executive sector, an executive-branch board will regu/ate and direct 
intelligence agencies. It will also impose 
penalties and bring legal action through the 
office of the Attorney-General against em
ployees in that sector who are caught leak1i Dis '3J an en anpa teen thii tanner

Schorr (right) with his lawyer
ing government information. Under Fords 
proposal, the guilt will rest solely on the 
perpetrator of the leak; recipients of illicit 
material cannot be charged, although they 
can be forced, as Schorr is being, into testi
fying against their donors.
Clearly, Daniel Schorr and the Village 
Voice were both recipients of information 
passed on from a higher source. As princi
pals in the current House Inquiry, they rep
resent, in essence, the free press. Most of 
the information about the CIA printed in 
the February 16 issue of the Village Voice 
had already been made public; little was 
new. Of the so-called new information, 
none could be said to be really damaging to 
United States security. Nevertheless, the 
printing of the report violated an act of 
Congress. The question which must be de
cided is whether or not a congressional or
der takes precedence over the first amend
ment.
It is unfortuante that so much of what
we know and learn about our government 
is gotten through unscrupulous means. 
While it is true that the American system 
allows for more criticism of itself from 
both within the government and without 
th an any other, it is also true that the fear 
of such criticism or the exaggerated fear of 
the effect of the publics learning the truth 
keeps a good deal hidden that need not be. 
The Watergate cover-up was symptomatic 
of this type of fear. Nixon looked worse 
when the truth leaked out; if he had con
fessed in the beginning, he might still be 
President. Likewise, leaks to the press with 
shock titles like the Voices The Report 
on the CIA that President Ford doesnt 
Want You to Read make oui government 
look worse to us and to outsiders than it 
might otherwise appear. If journalists such 
as Schorr are being forced to accept re
sponsibility for actions that bear semblance 
of illegality in them, it is time the Ameri
can government was forced to do the same.

President Cyert has openly stated that 
e doesnt have much hope for improving 
ur School of Humanities. CMUs reputaion is for training competent professionls in fields like architecture, business adnistration, and engineering. Since we 
nt compete with other schools for excelence in the humanities, its a bad investent to try. I find this attitude disappointng andfar worsedishonest. Were no 
onger Carnegie Tech; we claim to be a Uni 
ersity with a diverse range of offerings, 
nfortunately, our present humanities reain service departments. Its studentsand 
metimes its facultylack the expertise 
nd commitment of professionals, and for 
good reason: I dont think we have formlated a clear understanding of what the 
umanities are, of what a competent 
umanistic thinker does. It is because we 
ack this understanding that the humanities 
ere remain unprofessional and lackluster.
Suspicion of the humanities is nothing 
ew. Doctors or metallurgists have a trade, 
skill, a quantifiable set of formulae and 
ools. They know how to remove tonsils or 
dentify a chemical. But what does the hisorian or literary critic do, exactly? After 
all, we are not an age that respects Renais
sance men. We buy millions of how-to 
books, but were careful to note that our 
gardening or psychologizing are hobbies, 
not careers. The humanities too appear to 
us as hobbies. We see these scholars as 
counting angels on pinheads as one would 
count passing cars on a long journey. Any
one can read a novel; what does the English 
teacher tell us about this document that we
cant feel out for ourselves?
The misconception is precisely this idea 
that unscientific things are based on feel
ing. An architect can know that a poorly 
constructed building will fall down; but the 
professor disdainful of Rod McKuen is 
only rationalizing his emotions, construct
ing fact from fancy. One simply likes 
Freud, or believes in abortion: whats there 
to argue about? After all, such things are 
based on taste, and if the teacher doesnt 
like your poem, he cant prove that its 
bad.
There are differences of opinion in his
tory and literature, just as there are in any 
discipline. Even doctors, our paradigms of 
scientific objectivity, dont always agree if 
an organs got to go. But uncertainty doesnot excuse the humanities student from 
rigorous, systematic thought, from disci
pline. CMU humanities students display a 
pervasive lack of interest in defining, ques
tioning, and defending ideas. Notions in 
classes spontaneously generate, like small 
talk at a party, and are given no further ex
ploration or justification.
I dont think we stress the tools of seri
ous analytic thought necessary to the hu
manities. We all know about the wide
spread decline of even simple literacy in 
universities. Because we lack these tools, 
the humanities seem like a big, heavy sea 
on which we need merely float: a little 
proud, of course, for reading Ulysses or 
studying Chinese history and not sinking, 
but still... floating.
The humanities faculty, who should be 
the first to bemoan this lack of commit
ment, actually encourages it. Big efforts are 
made to draw people out in class discus
to erit1 a summer of study 3t unusually pleasant surroundings choosing 
from a wide variety of courses taught by distinguished Stanford faculty and 
visiting professors. Courses offered include:

sions, to make them talk, but talkings not 
enough-statements arent challenged or 
dealt with. Everyone can think, were 
soothed. Reading and written work are 
light, and assignments are calculated to be 
creative and flexiblee.g., we need no 
longer be intimidated by the standards of 
coherent and persuasive thought.
Disdain for easy-A humanities courses 
is justified. Courses are often designed to 
be fun and attractive rather than enlighten
ing. Students are drawn into courses like 
film not because theyre important (which 
they are), but because theyre time-out and
 amusing. Students admit to hoping to 
breeze through a Medieval Semester by 
dressing up as monks and eating mutton. 
Its never very hard to breeze by. Class dis
cussions drown in facileness, which is taken 
to be a sign of sophistication; half-baked 
notions are tossed around like beach balls.
That the new English Writing Lab gets' 
little business is no surprise. Nobody wor
ries about bad writing because nobody is 
asked to worry. Were still graded on our 
ideas, not our expression of them. The 
travesty of this is that ideas are their ex
pression: theyre good only insofar as they 
are convincing, interesting, etc. Coherent 
writing is not just a trivial but necessary 
skill, like typing or balancing checkbooks. 
Our thinking cannot be much more than 
muddled or commonplace if we dont have 
to struggle with it.
CMUs current emphasis on the careeroriented aspects of the humanitiesad
ding a Social Sciences Department, for in
stanceis fruitless. Trying to make the hu
manities a discipline by making them tech
nical misses the point. We have a psycholo
gy department with virtually no offerings 
in the theory or development of psycholog
ical inquiry; a philosophy department lim
ited to offering the few required courses 
for English and Art majors. Where will all 
the measuring, the quantifying get us with
out the foundation of solid and original 
thought? What, exactly, are our psycholo
gy students measuring, if theyre not asked 
to consider what they need to know? The 
technical emphasis is shallow and limiting. 
Were afraid of the uncertain, the debatable 
because we dont know how to debate. We 
have forgotten how to defend ideas with 
words rather than numbers.
This disregard for careful, in-depth 
thinking is particularly devastating for cre
ative writing majors, or at least for those 
who care about literature and writing. Writ
ing workshops count towards the required 
studio course in the humanities core. 
Real studio classes are hard to get intothe 
Art Department wants painters, not doodlers-so many people try their hand at 
poetry or fiction, giggling and halfhearted. 
Even serious writers, infected by CMUs 
obsession with The Professional, are more 
interested in publishing than in spending 
the time to do good work. The concern is 
with presenting the image of a writer, not 
with doing the work of one.
Dr. Cyert is right: we dont have a com
petitive excellence in the humanities. With 
any commitment, however, the situation 
could be improved. First of all, humanities 
studentsespecially Creative Writing ma
jorsshould be selected for admission by 
portfolios. CMU applications dont even re
quire essays anymore; how is the promising 
writer chosen? Second, more emphasis 
should be put on basic courses like compo
sition and philosophical argument. Last 
year, 185 students applied for 12 places in 
a Yale University course in exposition. 
They were made to see they needed this 
course; we arent. Third, and most import
ant, humanities teachers must stop enter
taining and start demanding serious work 
from students. Classes should be structured 
to be rigorous as well as provocative.
Without such discipline, we can never 
hope to get professionalism from the 
School of Humanities. Such scholarship is 
essential if we are to examine the churning 
out of technocratsthe stress on action 
rather than reflectionthat haunts a much 
larger area than CMUs campus. A lack of 
commitment to scholarship amounts, final
ly, to a lack of faith in innovative, influen
tial thought. I dont see how CMU can af
ford not to invest in this commitment.

CREATING MODERN FURNITURE Trends, 
Techniques, Appreciation
by DONA Z. and MELVIN MEILACH 
580 photographs, 20 color plates 
$5.95
Dona and Melvin Meilach do not limit them
selves to simple functional pieces; they have re
searched furniture making from its sculptural 
forms in Greece and Egypt through to presentday machine-engineered furniture.
They separate furniture according to mater
ials: furniture made from logs, furniture from 
found materials, fiber furniture, rubber tube 
furniture, fiberglass and molded plastic furniture, 
bent chrome, and even chairs made from paper 
and cardboard. They discuss unusual styles in 
furniture, including the modern fantasy trend 
and the use of cubes and other free forms. Draw
ing from the Greek, Egyptian, African, Haitian, 
and Oriental, the book is a fascinating study of 
all types of furniture making and how to do it 
in step-by-step photographs.

HOCKEY SEASON PLAGUED BY INJURIES
The CMU Hockey Club started out the 
|75-76 season with high expectations. At 
end of last seasons league play, Pitt an[unced their withdrawal from the 
>IHA. Since Pitt was the Tartans only 
hjor competition in the league, CMU 
|ose to drop out also and seek stronger 
ipetition to fill out their schedule. 
They did not expect their record to rival 
it of 1974-75 (18-3-0), but they did ex|ct to do better than their 4 and 12 recthis year. The Tartan icers were 
jgued by more injuries this year than 
ey had in the last three years combined, 
^ing mafcy key players for a number of 
les and forcing many skaters to play in 
Ifamiliar positions. Most notable of these 
fcasions was when Tartan wing Matt 
Dldsmith donned the goalie pads and 
led the nets in the January 25 Gannon 
ie because both CMU goalies had been 
ljured and had to be carried from the ice 
rlier in the game.
The club will lose five regular skaters 
m3e year. These include both co-captains, 
lake Gallaway and Larry Stuever, who 
Lve contributed a great deal. Mike has 
ben a mainstay for the Tartans for the last 
Ur years, teaming up with Mike Ken
zo rthy for many of the spectacular plays 
hat carried the Tartans for three strong 
basons. Larry has been the backbone of 
ie clubs defense for the last two years

joinder. Frank Sciulli will be another

When Coach Dave Maloney said that he 
loped to improve Carnegie-Mellons basletball team with good recruiting, he 
psnt kidding. He recently announced 
iiat he has landed one of the Easts top 
|rospects in junior college All-Arrterican 
andidate George Harvey.
Harvey, a Pittsburgh native, was actively 
sught by several major colleges following 
/o outstanding seasons at Allegheny 
Jommunity College. He joins Gene Turner, 
ennis Derringer, and Larry DiCicco as 
ICC stars that have enrolled at CMU in repnt years.
Maloney commented, George is withit a doubt a major college player and the 
ontributions he will make to our program 
innumerable.
Harvey possesses the natural skills of 
remep.dous quickness and leaping ability 
make him a dynamic performer. He
lead his team in scoring with 20.2 points 
per game and seven assists per game from 
his guard position this season.
Harvey ranks high in ACC career statis
tics in several categories. He is second in 
career points with 808 and career assists 
with 318. He is the Cougars third all-time 
field goal leader with 343 and third in free 
throws with 122.
Harvey raked in several post-season 
honors this year. At the NCJAA play-offs 
early in March, he was the leading vote 
getter on the Region 20 All-Star team and 
the MVP in the All-Star game. He was also 
selected Junior College Player of the Year 
by the Pittsburgh Basketball Writers Asso
ciation.
Previous honors included being an AllCity selection while at Peabody High 
School and making the All-Service team 
while a sergeant in the Air Force with a 
remarkable 45 point per game average.

Leety could have been a great asset except 
that he spent most of his time in a cast. He 
definitely would have been a leading scor
er.
Tom Grimm and Jeff Jacobs are expect
ed to return next year; they should help fill 
out the gaps along with Tartan regulars 
Jack Arturo, Mark Jonnatti, Bill Miller, Jim 
Morse, Bill Thompson, and Skip Wallace. 
Steve Fuchs hopes to move up to a regular
defensive shift. The icers also have some 
promising freshmen in Don Jacobson, Rick 
Smith, and Jeff Reh.
If the Tartans get their usual allotment 
of new players and can avoid major injur
ies, they should field a strong team next 
year.
The Hockey Club will continue to seek 
higher quality competition but is consider
ing forming a small league next year with 
Duquesne, Indiana (Pa.), St. Vincent, and 
possibly West Virginia.

Pika, Beta and PKT Top Buggy Picks
by The Compubookie
note: The Compubookie is a little green 
gnome who lives under Panther Hollow 
Bridge and who comes out once a year to 
make comments and predictions on the 
buggy races.
Hi there buggy nurds! Once again, I 
am here to offer you my pragmatic prog
nostications, dealt upon you with the ut
most objectivity. First, lei me say that I 
had a tough time picking this years prob
able order of finish, because this is going 
to be the closest sweepstakes in a long 
time. It wouldnt surprise me to see only 6 
or 7 seconds separating number 1 from 
number 6. Also, 2 or 3 organizations 
should pass last years 2:19.3 record, and 
the winning time will be in the vicinity 
of 2:16.
1. Phi Kappa Theta Not in their wildest 
Fanty did Phi Kap dream of last years dis
aster. However, they should emerge from 
the Shadows this year and streak to a spot 
in the top 6. Despite a weak push team -- 
Niwara near as good as past teams -- a vast
ly improved freeroll should net them a 
sub-2:25 time.
2. Sigma Nu A thousand apologies to the 
Zoo for picking them to finish fifth last 
year. They proved that 1974s amazing 
roll was no fluke. Sigma Nu is the mystery v 
entry this year. They have always been the 
only organization that wouldnt go all out 
before race day, but this year they look 
downright disorganized, showing up at one 
freeroll with no brakes, and at anothejr 
with no people. Their already-hurting push 
team is suffering even further from the loss 
of Zankowski and Butcher. The heat will 
be on Dave Thomas, wholl have a lot of 
work to do this week in order to get his 
old buddies ready for raceday. (I think 
theyll finish in the top 6 but I dont know 
where.)
3. Alpha Tau Omega Possessed of the fast
est push team in the school, ATO is in des
perate need of a good roll. If their tires 
stay intact through the chute and the turn,

The C.I.A. "Streetcar" coming into the turn.I6hbh vD Oh. 9heir6
this should be their year to crack the top 3. 
Their freeroll times have been impressive, 
and the push team is stronger than ever. 
The 1976 dark horse, it wouldnt surprise 
me to see ATO win it all.
4. Beta Theta Pi Last year, Beta tried 
blowing it up and they blew it. Their push 
team is second only to ATOs, but not even 
a strong flick of the Bic helped their disas
trous roll last spring. Are pneumatics the 
answer? What was the question? Will the
'government let the SST land in the United 
States? Can Schulman get them psyched 
for buggy the way he did for football? Bar
ring any cars on the course, or flat tires, 
the Big Red rates as another strong con
tender.
5. Pi Kappa Alpha The third fastest push 
team and the second fastest roll combined 
to give Pika a first place trophy (of their 
very own) and a new record last year. Can 
they do it again? I think so. The pushers 
and the roll will be as good as, or better,
than 75s, and the extra year of sleep will 
be invaluable to the drivers. But who
knows? Even the Compubookie is wrong __
sometimes (on rare occasions). See you 
Friday.
The Compubookie predicts:
1. Pi Kappa Alpha
2. Alpha Tau Omega
3. Beta Theta Pi
4. Phi Kappa Theta
5. Beta B
6. Pika B
Sigma Nu will be in there somewhere.

ViEN TAKE OPENERl Bugg Comments
by Elly Zimmerman
CMUs mens tennis team defeated John 
Carroll in their opening PAC Conference 
match on Saturday, 6-3.
Roger Cambor and Paul Gehman had 
the strongest showing by winning both 
their singles and doubles.
Peggy Russell, the Head Tennis Coach, 
coached the team to a second place finish 
in the PACs last year. We hope to be 
very strong in the conference again this 
year. We have more depth in our line up 
than in the past but its a young team,  
Russel commented. The team lost two 
seniors last year, Val Kurjakovic (first 
singles) and Steve Hoysan (fifth singles) 
but they gained two excellent Freshmen, 
Dave Chandler and Marc Silver. Roger* 
Cambor, a senior starter, hasnt played for 
the team since freshman year and is anoth
er strong asset.
The results of the John Carroll match 
are below:

Carnegie-Mellon fencers in intramural competition.I6hbh vD ?yy3hb Ihrhk3bA
Fencers Place Fourth
by Gordon Morrison
The Carnegie-Mellon University wo
mens varsity fencing team took fourth 
place in the Pennsylvania State Womens 
Collegiate Team and Individual Fencing 
Championship on Friday March 19 at 
Temple University in Philadelphia. Pennsyl
vania State University (main campus) 
finished first. The second place through 
fifth place teams were very evenly 
matched. CMU tied their team match with 
the second, third, and fifth place team at
2-2. The match with the University of 
Pennsylvania ended in a tie, even after 
using a tie-breaking formula. Penn finished 
in second place. Temple University beat 
CMU by the use of the tie-breaking formu
la and consequently finished third. Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania lost to CMU by
the use of the tie-breaking formula and 
finished fifth. The tie-breaking formula 
used is the difference between touches 
scored and touches received. The team 
with the largest number wins the match.
CMU was invited to a tournament next 
year at the main campus of Penn State due 
to the high caliber of fencing exhibited 
this year. Miriam Whitworth finished fifth 
out of all the A fencers. An A fencer is the 
number one fencer on each team, with B 
being the second best and so on. Jenny Wil
lis finished second among the fencers. Joan 
Gravitz finished tied for fifth among the C 
fencers, while Rise Reinecker finished third 
among the D fencers. Since Jenny lost only 
once in the team competition, she was invi
ted to fence in the individual part of the 
tournament. She finished eighth in the 
individuals.
by L.S.D.C.
The last freeroll practice has been run, 
and race day 1976 is only three days away. 
Everyone is ready for that once a year two 
and a half minute event into which so 
much preparation goes. Friday and Satur
day will tell who has best prepared for the 
contest. The weather this spring has been 
exceptional, and only one freeroll practice 
has been rained out, and that one was 
made up with an extra freeroll last Satur
day morning. The freerolls of the last two 
weekends have seen numerous accidents, 
although there have been no serious injur
ies. DUs infamous Captain America sent 
its driver to the hospital for six stitches, 
and DU has finally (and wisely) decided to
retire it from service. Also involved in ac
cidents were CIA, BTP, and SAE.
PKA seems to be the hands-down fav
orite to defend their record-breaking time 
of last year. They have had very impressive 
freeroll times so far, and the rest just de
pends on what their push team can do. Af
ter PKA, peoples opinions seem to differ 
widely, and the results of the races will de
pends greatly on the performances of the 
push teams.
So the stage has been set for the 1976 
edition of a 56-year-old CMU tradition. 
With the paving of the freeroll side of the 
course, it is quite probable that the course 
record of 2:19.3 will be broken again. Let 
us hope for a good and safe race this year.LIFE-SAVING CLASS

CMU Athletic Department and the Physi
cal Education Department a special course
