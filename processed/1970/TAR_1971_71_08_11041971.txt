CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY VOL. 71 NO. 8 NOVEMBER 4, 1971
President Stever Is Nominee 
For Director Of National Science 
Foundation; Denies Having Resigned
President Nixon is expected 
to nominate soon, President H. 
Guyford Stever of CarnegieMellon University to the Director
ship of the $600 million National 
Science Foundation.
Stever reportedly has re
ceived the strongest recommen
dation of the National Science 
Board, which submitted a list of 
possible nominees to President 
Nixon early in October.
When asked last Tuesday if he 
had resigned from CMU at the 
October 18th Trustee meeting, as 
rumored, President Stever replied 
flatly, Nope. Stever however, 
has told the Trustees Executive 
Committee he is being considered 
for the Directorship of the Na
tional Science Foundation.
Asked to comment on the 
rumor that he will become Direc
tor of the N.S.F. Stever said, All 
sorts of rumors are going around, 
some are true; some arent.
On further questioning, he 
added, One doesnt talk about 
such a nomination until one gets 
one. When a definite offer comes, 
you begin to consider it.
Early in October a Washing
ton, D.C. newsletter, Science and 
Government Report stated that 
President Stever would most likely
be Nixons nominee for the direc
torship of the N.S.F. And two 
weeks ago, the Boston GLOBE ran 
an article to the same effect.
GLOBE Science Editor, Vic
tor McElheny told the TARTAN, 
Ive heard from people inside the 
Foundation that Stever is going to 
get it (the nomination).
With a budget of $600 mil
lion, the National Science Founda
tion serves as the major support for 
fundamental research done by the 
government.
The Presidents nominee for 
the post of Director is subject to 
Congressional approval, similar to 
a Supreme Court nominee. Presi
dent Stever, because of his strong 
professional qualifications and 
reputation as an independent 
Republican, would most likely 
have little trouble gaining Congresssional approval.
In 1969, Nixon nominated 
the highly qualified and conser
vative Frank Long of Cornell to 
the N.S.F. Directorship, only to 
discover that Long opposed the 
ABM. Nixon then withdrew the 
nomination, setting off a furor in 
the scientific community so large 
that he was forced to re-nominate 
Long, who subsequently rejected 
it.
For certain, President Nixon 
will be most careful not to nomi
nate a man who will cause him 
similar political embarrasment.
The current N.S.F. Director, 
W. D. McElroy, is a bluff, jovial, 
ex-football-playing, Texas Demo
crat. McElroy was formerly a 
biologist at Johns Hopkins, and 
proved himself quite effective poli
tically at the N.S.F. McElroy will 
be assuming the chancellorship of 
the University of California at San 
Diego on February 1 st.
Previous Directors of the 
twenty-year-old Foundation are: 
James B. Conant, who came from 
the Presidency of Harvard; Aian 
Waterman, from the Office of 
Naval Research; and Leland Ha
worth, from the Atomic Energy 
Commission.
President Stever is an interna
tionally-respected expert on aero
nautical engineering and space 
technology. In addition to 
teaching at Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology for 24 years, he has 
served as chief scientist with the 
U.S. Air Force and has headed 
many aeronatucial and scientific 
advisory committees at the 
Federal level.
Womens Commission Completes Study
Women at Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity are under-represented in 
the faculty, the administration, 
and decision-making bodies; are 
paid less than men for the same 
work; have declining educational 
opportunities, and are often the 
victims of inconsistent records-and 
faulty communication, according 
to a report submitted by a study 
commission to CMU President H. 
Guyford Stever.
The group, the Commission on 
the Status and Needs of Women at 
CMU, which was established last 
spring by President Stever, urged 
that the University establish an Ofiice of Equal Opportunity charged 
with monitoring affirmative action 
plans for women and minorities 
and reporting to the President.
The Commission was composed 
of faculty members, administra
tors, students, alumnae and staff. 
In creating the Commission in 
March, the CMU President urged 
that it:
Examine University operations 
that pertain to women students 
and employees
Make recommendations to en
hance the opportunities for 
women at CMU
Suggest broad outlines of an af
firmative action plan to correct dis
criminatory practices
Make recommendations con
cerning a continuing vehicle to 
monitor implementation of such a 
plan.
In complying with the CMU 
Presidents request, the Commis
sion employed a variety ol tech
niques including public hearings, 
individual and group interviews 
with students, faculty, staff, and
alumnae, and comprehensive re
search on salaries, job classifica
tions, termination rates, fringe 
benefits, educational oppor
tunits, and other specialized con
ditions. The final report was pub
lished this week.
A total of 55 recommendations 
for improving the conditions for 
women at Carnegie-Mellon were 
made by the Commission. It also 
suggested that the proposed Office 
of Equal Opportunity be headed 
by two co-directors, one of whom 
should be a woman. Specific func
tions recommended by the Com
mission for the new office include 
helping administrators locate 
qualified women for open posi
tions, collecting data on compli
ance with affirmative action plans,

National Science Foundation.
MDC Film Funds Cut
On October 29th, the Activities 
Board decided that it would not 
allocate $2000 of Special Program
ming Fund money to help finance 
Mens Dorm Council films. In a 
letter sent by Bill Iacono and Steve 
Singer of the AB to Sam Frenkil of 
MDC, several reasons for the deci
sion were cited.
The most important reason is 
that the Mens Dorm Council has 
refused to submit an accurate bud
get breakdown of its incomes and 
expenditures. The members of the 
AB apparently feel that the AB is 
entitled to see a breakdown of in
comes and expenditures for MDC 
films. The AB feels that income 
derived from MDC pay films 
should be used to sponsor other 
films and reduce the money
needed from the Activities Boards 
Special Programming Fund. With
out an accurate budget break
down, the AB has no way of seeing 
whether Programming Fund 
money is being managed properly.
Another reason cited by Singer
and Iacono is that MIX' sponsors 
as part of its series several pay 
films, shown on Friday night. 
These are in direct conflict with 
the established AB Film Series, 
which shows movies every Friday 
night. The letter also said, It 
does not benefit the Campus Com
munity if two quality pay films are 
being shown on the same night, at 
the same time.
Iacono and Singer say that they 
have tried to work in conjunction 
with MDC concerning film schedu
ling, but it has been to no avail. An 
agreement with the AB and MDC 
was apparently worked out, but 
the MDC has not fulfilled its obli
gations which were:
Arrange a double feature be
tween the AB film, KING MUR
RAY, and their film, I AM CURI
OUS YELLOW, which were sched
uled for the same date.
Change the dates on their Fri
day night pay films for second sem
ester, with the possible exception

Editor's Note
If President Stever had any 
intention of declining the post of 
Director of the National Science 
Foundation, he would not have al
lowed his name to go to the White 
House for consideration.
Should Nixon choose to 
nominate Stever as is anticipated, 
Carnegie-Mellon will doubtless be 
less one president.
But when President Stever 
says he has not tendered his resig
nation to the Board of Trustees, he 
is telling the truth. Certainly he 
would not have resigned from his 
post here while yet unsure that he 
has the N.S.F. job.
Most likely, President Stever 
simply told the Trustees Execu
tive Committee that he was being 
considered for the N.S.F. Director
ship, and, if nominated by Nixon 
and approved by Congress, would 
accept that position and resign
Letters
from the Presidency of CMU.
The N.S.F. Directorship is a 
prestigious occupational plum for 
which President Stevers talents 
are particularly well suited.
Sometime prior to February 
1st, President Nixon will choose a 
politically expedient moment to 
announce his nominee to the 
N.S.F. post; only then will we 
know for certain the future of our 
universitys president.
If Stever does resign, dont 
assume that he will necessarily be 
replaced with a new president. I 
understand that for some time a 
faculty committee has been sug
gesting the university adopt a 
chancellor/provost administrative 
set-up. To me that sounds like a 
system in which you call the presi
dent a chancellor, and the vice 
presidents, provosts. Then again, 
Im intolerably ignorant.
I think its great that the fac
ulty is deciding how to run the 
administration. Next semester Ill 
be conducting a seminar in How 
to Teach.
In the meantime, President 
Stever and I will be waiting to hear 
from Mr. Nixon.
Maybe you had the opportunity 
last Friday afternoon to see the 
possible future director of the Nat
ional Science Foundation judge a 
Pumpkin Carving Contest on the 
cut.
The Contest, as well as the rest 
of the afternoons festivities, was 
sponsored by the campus Y of
fice, which succeeded in spon
soring the first event in which Ive 
seen people from all sectors of the 
campus partake.

Editors Note
Editor, The TARTAN:
Congratulations on your timely 
editorial concerning the H&SS 
grading system. I use the word 
timely because last Thursday 
morning I spoke with the Dean of 
the Pitt Law School concerning 
the matter. He told me that al
though a student on an Honors, 
Credit, No Entry system would 
not be completely disqualified, he 
would in most cases be at a definite 
disadvantage due to his lack of 
grades. A grade point average, he 
explained, is necessary as a means 
of comparison. He said that in the 
absence of grades, students apply
ing to his school are expected to 
have higher scores on their law 
school admissions test than are stu
dents who are on a graded system.
The question that I have to ask 
is: why should I, a student at CMU, 
paying five times the tuition that I 
would pay at a supposedly inferior 
state school, be considered inferior 
to a student who has gone to a 
state school only because Ive been 
denied grades. If CMU prides itself 
on a superior education it 
should then make that education 
useful (ie*it* should make it pos
sible for its students to get into 
professional schools).
In recent days Ive been accused 
of being selfish because I want to 
destroy the free educational at
mosphere by asking for an option 
w ere students who want grades 
ca l get them. I have to strongly 
di agree. Students in CIT who take 
classes in H&SS get grades. Do 
they destroy the free educational 
atmosphere? I dont think so. Even 
if they did, I doubt that CIT is 
about to put all of its students on 
the alternative grading system. 
Just so some of the students in 
H&SS can have a free educational 
atmosphere.
In other words, I dont think 
that a grade option would hurt the 
students that dont want grades 
why do they want to hurt me?
An obvious solution to the 
problem is to transfer, but I like 
Carnegie-Mellon and I like the fact 
that it can offer me a self defined 
major that I cant get anywhere 
else. On the other hand I cant stay 
here out of blind faith. I dont 
want to leave, so Ive decided, 
along with a group of other stu
dents, to try and change things.

Dear Mr. Campbell:
As you can see the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
has a committee looking into the 
problem that you raised in your 
editorial of October 28.
You can help by getting ii 
touch with Professor Cassidy, 
chairman of the committee, and 
giving him the evidence that yoa 
collected.
I dont know whether the ap
pointment of the committee reas
sures you or not; but we are not 
ignoring the problem. As you sug
gested in your editorial, we moved 
to this grading system at the urging 
of students. Now we find students 
unhappy with itwhich all goes to 
prove that student one is not stu
dent two is not student three...
Sincerely,
Erwin Steinberg 
Dean
Skibo Filth
Dear Editor,
I wonder if the students of 
CMU ever think about how they 
look to the outsider. By that I 
dont mean their physical appear
ance since beauty is as beauty 
does. And believe you me, a lot of 
them are not beautiful, judging 
from their action.
I am referring to the Skibo Ball
room and Lounge during and after 
an affair at Skibo. I was a recent 
visitor and spectator to your cam
pus, several weeks ago over a Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday. I was 
literally appalled at the filth 
created and lived in by you verbal 
ecologists. The ballroom was lit
tered with wine, whiskey and beer 
bottles, papers, bags, articles of 
clothing, (ood partic|es, etc, after a 
recent TGIF affair there and a Sat
urday night affair there.
On a Sunday evening I noticed 
trays, from the Tartan Shop, 
emply and half filled cups, paper 
dishes, and food all around. I no- * 
ticed in the Tartan Snack Bar, de
bris lying around on the tables and 
floor, although I noticed waste re
ceptacles placed throughout the 
Snack Bar. Students were in and 
out of the snack bar in their bare 
feet and with their dogs. I actually * 
saw a dog raise a leg and relieve 
himself at the serving counter.
These observations would not 
bother me so much if it were not 
for the fact that most of the furor 
about ecology comes from the stu
dents of colleges. They tell it like it 
is. However, I find them guilty of 
the same double standard they at
tribute to the older generation. 
That is they preach but dont 
practice. They cannot be 
trusted to police themselves (I 
wonder what the Universitys bud
get is for security and janitors now 
as opposed to 1961 ?).
Charity begin at home. Practice 
what you preach. Before any stu
dent groups again raise hell about 
ecology, I would first suggest that 
they look around their own cam
pus first and stop the litter in their 
rest rooms, Lounges, ballrooms, 
faculty rooms, cafeteria, coffee 
house,etc. (I noticed paper in the 
sinks, urinals and comodes in some 
of the mens rest rooms). If they 
act this way at home, no wonder 
that their parents have shipped 
them off to school (probably send 
them money at Holiday and seme
ster break so that they wont come 
home).
Since this is a criticism from an 
outsider I guess it will not get in
your Paper for all to see as Im 
certain that you do as most news 
media, print only what you want, 
rather than what is.
Respectfully,
Laurence Gutman

Theorems by Collins
Editor, the TARTAN:
Regarding the Theorems due to 
Collins: The following theorem 
was stated at the symposium on 
conputational complexity at the 
Courant Institute of New York 
University by Philip Spira of the 
University of California at 
Berkeley. (October 25,1971) 
Fundamental Theorem 
(Folk): Almost no problem we can 
think of is difficult; if a problem 
we can think of is difficult then we 
cant solve it.
Spira claims that this Funda
mental Theorem approaches in im
portance, relevance and impact, 
Churchs thesis.
The theorem can be para
phraseddepending, of course, on 
your tasteas follows:
Almost every problem we can 
think of is trivial. The symposium 
welcomed the theorem with uni
versal assent.
(Folk, Spira claims, also 
brought you folk music, folk rock 
and folklore.)

FOOD STAMP FOLLIES
If youre really into food and

called The Food Stamp Gour
met: Patrician Eating on a Prole
tarian Budget. Its written by 
Wm. Brown and illustrated by Gil

Freak Brothers fame. The draw
ings are easily worth the $1.50 Pitt 
Bookstore rip-off price. The 
recipes are rather complicated but 
are all under a dollar a serving. 
Yummy!
This weeks recipe appears 
courtesy of one starving roommate 
(we havent gotten our food 
stamps in the mail yet). She likes it 
because you can cook it, eat it, and 
store it all in one pot. She says its 
like playing with mudpiesyou 
have to add your own personality 
(and water) to it as you keep 
checking the rice. Warning! If you 
DONT check the rice, it will burn 
and youll have to soak the pot for
3 weeks to get it clean.

The grading system for the 
School of Humanities and Social 
Sciences was questioned and dis
cussed at open meeting held Tues
day Morning in the Wherret Room. 
It appears that many graduate 
schools do not understand or do 
not approve of the H&SS Honors, 
Credit, No Entry system. As a re
sult, many students who want to 
go to graduate school are put at a 
disadvantage with their competi
tion.
Presently, the H&SS student 
who applies to graduate school 
shows the school letters of evalu
ation written by his professors. Un
fortunately, these evaluations tend 
to be too brief. The evaluations 
usually say that a student is intel
ligent or he is a good worker. 
Because of the brevity and unim
portance attached to these evalu
ations, graduate schools tend to 
ignore them. Because of their dis
approval of both H&SS Credit/No 
Entry grading and the evaluations, 
The graduate schools rely mainly 
upon graduate record exam scores 
in judging a students ability.
The inconsistencies of the 
H&SS system do not appear to 
help the potential graduate stu
dent. The graduate schools ap
parently do not understand what 
all the letters are supposed to 
mean. A freshman is on Pass/Tail, a 
sophomore or junior is on the 
Honors/Credit/No Entry system, 
and the senior can choose to have 
either the Honors/Credit/No Entry 
system or the traditional A, B, C, 
D, or R grades. The graduate

It was suggested at the meeting 
that the inconsistencies make the 
system hypocritical. Neither the 
school nor the student is commit
ted to any one grading system. The 
school is unable to say that it offers 
a type of education which it be
lieves to be effective enough to 
benefit everyone without a tradi
tional grading system.
H&SS students with different 
viewpoints then discussed the ad
vantages and disadvantages of the 
varying systems. Everyone seemed 
to agree however, that while a 
more liberal grading system such as 
Honors/Credit/No Entry is de
sirable for education, it is not ade
quate enough for those individuals 
who are interested in continuing 
their education. Except for a few 
individuals, it appeared as if most 
of the students agreed that some 
better form of evaluation should 
be adopted for those individuals 
interested in attending graduate 
schools.
A committee has been formed 
which will send out questionaires 
to graduate schools to help clarify 
the situation. Dean Steinberg has 
sent out thirty such letters already. 
He suggested that students seize 
the initiative and write personal 
letters to the schools that interest 
them. Copies of his form letter, 
which attempts to explain the pre
sent system, are available at Skibo 
Information Desk. Further dis
cussions will be held when the re
sults of these questionaires and 
letters have been received.

As an economics major I would 
like to undertake a survey to dis
cover ways to make Student Sen
ate more efficient. One way to do
this would be to delegate certain 
Senate powers to outside groups. 
Senate in the past has been 
strangled by arguments and cannot 
resolve its conflicts. Groups acting 
independently of Senate (and 
working directly with the student 
body) could achieve solutions to 
many of Senates pressing prob
lems.

Student Senate should be a pro

like to be in Student Senate to 
make these changes.

have been the neglected portion of 
the campus for a long time. By my 
participation in Senate and specifi
cally the Rules Committee I have
tried to change this situation 
through such efforts as the reor
ganization of constituencies. I 
have also been an active member of 
the Commuter Council and would 
continue these efforts if reelected.

Gary Crosbie
I am a junior in Metallurgy and 
Materials Science and I am now 
running for my second term as a 
student senator. In the past year, I
have seen much and learned much 
about the ways of Senate. For 
most of the time, Senate is a very 
frustrating place to be. Once in a 
while, though, Senate shakes out 
its groggy head and serves as forum 
for ideas and intelligent discussion. 
I hope that my experience can help 
to promote Senate to be more of 
the things it can be.

I would like to remind the Stu
dent Senate that there are items of 
importance other than the Chess 
and Karate clubs and WRCT. 
There are trivia such as housing, 
food service, and academic affairs. 
Maybe even off-campus housing 
and the small problems associated 
with it merit a little attention.
Items such as bike racks really 
should not be considered by Sen
ate however, since consideration 
of this small an item would be de
meaning. Anyway hardly anybody 
uses bikes anymorewith all those 
parking spaces available, every
body finds it convenient to drive a 
car.

Fraterities
William Ruppert
The fraternities must show the 
school that our demise is not emin
ent, and one way to do this is 
through strong representation in 
the Senate. As a former fraternity 
president and as a friend of many 
fraternity men outside of my 
house I can well represent our 
viewpoint.
Stan Edelstein
In recent years it has been said 
that fraternities are dying. This in
correct statement is partially a re
sult of the fact that we have not 
had adequate representation. Stu
dent Senate CAN be an effective f 
tool and it is my goal that the will 
of the fraternities be heard on 
BOTH sides of Forbes Avenue.

MDC has tried to make arrange
ments for the double feature, but 
they are not adequate according to 
the AB. After strong urging, the 
MDC has mentioned KING MUR
RAY in their CURIOUS YELLOW 
ads, but have not mentioned that 
the two movies are playing almost 
concurrently at two different 
places. Evidently the MDC has also 
not done anything to resolve the
film conflicts that will occur sec
ond semester. Bill Iacono has 
noted that the AB film series publi
city has been out since last May, 
while the MDC made their film 
schedule this fall and that all their 
publicity has not been released.
Iacono also said that he realizes 
that the MDC series is popular and 
that he hopes that MDC will coop
erate with AB so that they can 
receive money from the Program
ming Fund.

Johnny Got His Gun
Dalton Trumbos film JOHN
NY GOT HIS GUN answers once 
and for all the burning question 
what does a deaf, dumb, blind, 
armless, legless, faceless man do in 
his spare time? The answer is quite 
naturally that he wishes that he 
was dead. Except for this revela
tion, this film offers its audience 
little more than an excuse to think 
whatever they worship that they 
are not like that poor fellow on the 
screen.
That poor fellow got that way 
because a shell sought out the same 
foxhole that he did one night dur
ing World War I. Naturally, this has 
caused him to have some slight 
anti-military feelings, but these 
dont carry over to the audience to 
any great degree. JOHNNY GOT 
HIS GUN will not cause anyone 
who isnt already anti-war to 
change his way of thinking, be
cause it isnt an anti-war film. It 
isnt even a pro-peace film for that 
matter. In fact, if the film is to be 
catagorized, it is perhaps best 
labeled a pro-euthanasia film. This 
picture will leave its audience firm
ly convinced that all cases such as 
the poor fellow breathing out of 
that tube in his throat should de
finitely be painlessly put to death.
Of course, since one does not 
regularly bump into such people as 
the poor fellow up there on the 
screen, ones feelings about the 
matter are rather soon dulled in 
much the same fashion that the 
urgent need to find a cure for 
muscular distrophy is after the Jer
ry Lewis telethon goes off the air 
until next Labor Day.
If this is what Dalton Trumbo 
set out to achieve, he has suc
ceeded. Yet, one gets the feeling 
that he was trying to do more and 
somewhere along the line failed. In 
this case, the failure of the film lies 
solely on Trumbos shoulders for 
he not only directed the film, but 
he also wrote the screenplay, adapting it from his novel. Perhaps
Trumbo was too close to his own 
material to step back and see the 
weaknesses inherent in it. This 
seems to be the most likely answer 
to what happened, because instead 
of minimumizing these flaws, 
Trumbo appears to have enlarged 
them. Within the framework of the 
film, the audience is given glimpses 
of a much better film trying to get 
out, but just like that poor fellow 
up there it is hopelessly trapped.
Trumbos direction of this film 
is uneven to say the least. At times 
his hand is so readily apparent that 
the whole situation appears to be 
more contrived than it really is; 
while at other moments the actors 
seem to be thoroughly left on their 
own without a guiding hand 
anywhere around. This is not to 
say that the film is allowed to 
degenerate into pathosfar from 
it. If Trumbo succeeds in anything 
it is getting the audience on his 
side. They definitely feel sorry for 
that poor fellow up there on the 
screen, but thats the extent of 
their reactions. Trumbo is only 
capable of taking his audience so 
far. He fails because he cannot en
large their feelings to encompass 
anything else. They are sorry for 
that poor fellow, but really the 
film does not make them feel one 
way or another about the war or 
the people who made him that 
way. The only time they feel emo
tion for anyone else happens when 
an officer is introduced who wont 
let a nurse put the poor fellow out 
of his misery.
Trumbo gets the audience to 
swallow his premise, no mean feat 
when one stops to consider it, but 
he cannot get this feeling to go 
beyond the particulars which he 
presents to the universals which lie 
beyond it.
Trumbo doesnt get much help 
from his actors either. Supposedly, 
they all worked for small salaries 
because they so ardently believed 
in the project. Well, on the screen
they give the appearance of having 
some second thoughts about the 
whole thing. The acting in the first 
few scenes is so wooden that one 
wonders if the right scenes were 
inserted in the cutting room. After 
that, it vascillates between being 
average to just plain poor.
The film is stolen by Donald 
Southerland who in two all too 
short cameo sequences plays Jesus 
Christ. Southerlands Christ is 
slightly cynical, amusing, and 
above all realistic in his outlook. 
Although the role is very slight, 
Southerlands talents shine 
through with such force that he 
makes the other actors look like 
they are badly in need of acting 
lessons.
Timothy Bottoms plays that 
poor fellow up there on the screen, 
and one must say that he does his 
best to make the whole thing be
lievable. After all, he does keep it 
from turning into a horrible black 
comedy, but then too, the cards 
are in his favor for all he has to do 
is to sound trapped and look lik an 
all-American boy in the flash
backs. Bottoms manages this, but 
his role is not a real challange, and 
one can only hope that this part is 
no real measure of his acting abi
lity.
Jason Robards plays Bottoms 
father in the flashbacks. Robards 
never really seems to come to grips 
with his part, for he keeps looking 
as if he is uncomfortable with the 
entire situation. His portrayal is 
unconvincing, for he keeps looking 
at his son as if he knew the fate 
which would eventually befall 
him.
JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN is a 
motion picture without a clear fo
cus. In the course of this motion 
picture a clear, definite statement 
is madethe only thing handicap
ping the film is that the audience is 
never quite certain what the state
ment is about.
Terence Palso
Nader's Raiders On $4 A Year
The question P.P.I.R.G. is 
trying to raise on this campus is 
whether Carnegie-Mellon students 
are sufficiently ecology and 
consumer minded to involve 
themselves.
What isPJP.I.R.G.?
Involved in what?
Why CMU? Nothing ever gets 
Dff the ground here. (Does anyone 
ecall the Office for Organization 
if Political Systems?)
So- the initials are for the Pittswirgh Public Interest Research 
jroup. They are involved in trackig down rip-offs and warning us 
boui them. Or as PENNPIRG (the 
tate Headquarters of the organiation)putsit:
They will carry out nonpartisan 
lalysis, study, or research in the 
reas of environmental preservaon, consumer protection, racial 
id sexual discrimination, product 
fety and corporate responsiKty.
They will make available to the 
jblic a full and fair exposition of
the pertinent results of their re
search.
They will work within the exis
ting legal system to defend the 
rights of the public as defined by 
law.
P.P.I.R.G. emphazies that it 
shall remain nonpartisan, non
profit, and student controlled. The 
main point of the research group is 
that the students will also finance 
such a group, the money being 
used to staff professionals 
scientists, lawyers, ecologists and 
othersand to cover operating 
costs. The students will direct 
these experts to the public interest 
projects mentioned. In other 
words, the students are the mana
gers, financers, and employers. The 
organization would be headed by a 
board of directors, student elected. 
The directors do not answer to 
Ralph Nader, to the state head
quarters, or to the national center. 
Each local group is on its own, 
funded by its local college cam
puses.
P.P.I.R.G. itself has proposed 
how this can be done. Their idea is 
to have each campus vote to in
crease their activity fee by $2 per 
student per semester... an 
amount less than that spent for a 
movie or a new record, according 
to their literature. CMU has 5000 
students which would yield 
$20,000 per year. P.P.I.R.G. pro
poses that its cost of operating 
would range from $150,000 to 
$300,000 per year, depending on 
size, experience of staff, and loca
tion. Thus, Pitt and Duquesne 
campuses must also be involved so 
that a research group might be able 
to be funded in Pittsburgh itself.
The $2 increase would suppo
sedly be turned over to the board 
of directors of the Pittsburgh re
search group, who would direct the 
handling of these funds. Students 
who do not approve of the projects 
undertaken by P.P.I.R.G. would be 
able to have their increase re
funded by a certain period in the

Women's Commission Report
and conducting programs to raise 
consciousness about sex dis* 
crimination.
President Stever has already in
dicated to the Commission that 
action is being taken on many of 
the recommendations.
The report states that Through 
six months of investigation, data 
analyses, discussions, thought, and 
study, the Commissioners have 
come to perceive CMU as a place 
where women do not enjoy full 
equality with men ... We have 
come to realize, however, that the 
inequities which exist result not 
from evil intentions and deliberate 
injustice, but rather from over
sight, from a failure to examine our 
traditions in the light of our values, 
and to a large extent from a general 
fogginess about what sex discrimi
nation is.
The most widespread inequities 
exist, according to the Commis
sion, in the comparison of faculty 
and administrative salaries, fringe 
benefits, contract or position sta
tus, leaves, and terminations. It 
indicated that, for example, while 
34% of the University employees 
are women, only 12% of the total 
faculty are women, and only four 
women are full professors. Four
teen CMU academic departments 
have no women faculty, the report 
stated, including several depart
ments which grant Ph.D. degrees to
women.
In eleven possible faculty salary 
comparisons made by the Commis
sion, men have higher average sal
aries in nine. Even in those colleges 
which have some women faculty 
members in all ranks there is a 
sizable difference in favor of men. 
For example women in the College 
of Fine Arts earned $1716 less on 
the average than men; women in 
the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences average $822 less 
than men based on a ten month 
salary.
Other inequities among faculty 
cited by the report were that con
tracts for women tend to be short
er than for men, a possibility that 
tenure may be given as a substitute 
for promotion among women 
faculty, lower levels of fringe bene
fits, and fewer University suppor
ted Leaves of Absence.
The Commission found that 
few women are represented in 
managerial jobs and that women 
were paid less than men in each of 
eleven job categories (admini
stration and staff) in which com
parisons were possible. The 
amount of salary inequity is appal
ling, the report states. Women 
department heads earn about half 
as much as men in that category, 
women in general management 
positions earn about $5,000 less 
than men in that category, and 
women non-academic profes
sionals earn about $3,000 less than 
men.
Generally, the Commission 
found, neither women faculty 
members nor administrators were 
involved on policy-making bodies 
outside of the faculty senate.
While finding relatively fewer 
major problems in treatment of 
women students enrolled at CMU, 
the Commission did find what it 
termed sex bias in some admis
sions practices and educational op
portunities.
A study of the number of 
women students who applied, arid 
the number admitted in each col
lege in the University, and conver
sations with those invovled in the 
admissions decisions, resulted in 
the following conclusions:
Where programs have more than 
50% women enrollment, they tend 
to be discontinued.
Where programs have more than 
50% women applicants, discrimi
natory admissions policies tend to 
develop.
Where programs have less than 
10% women applicants, no efforts 
are made to attract more women.
The Commission concluded 
that a bias against women stu
dents exists in CMUs overall edu
cational practice.
In defining what it meant by 
declining educational opportuni
ties, the Commission cited the eli
mination of the School of Social
Work in 1953, the transfer to the 
University of Pittsburgh of the 
School of Library Science in 1962, 
and the termination of existing un
dergraduate programs in Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College, sched
uled for 1973. All of these pro
grams enrolled more women than 
men.
Concluding its report the Com
mission stated The very existence 
of this Commission has helped to 
produce some improvements in the 
status of women at CMU ... We 
have noted, and should mention 
here, that on many occasions all 
that was necessary to correct some 
specific inequity was to call it to 
the attention of the usually over
worked administrator who did not 
know it existed and who hastened 
to correct it when asked to do so.
Having acknowledged our 
awareness that some small progress 
has been made, we conclude by 
referring back to our beginning; 
this Commission came into being 
because the administration wanted 
data on the relative status of men 
and women at CMU before it was 
willing to authorize programs to 
equalize the status of women. The 
Commission on the Status and 
Needs of Women has labored long 
and hard to do its part to provide 
that datait is now time for the 
administration and the entire Uni
versity community to do their 
part.

T. M. Drafto
Jujitsu, Judo, and Karate
Womens Dorm Council is spon
soring a lecture by one of the 
nations foremost authorities on 
self defense, Mr. Frederic 
Storaska.
Mr. Storaska started his career 
as many of us are doing, rejecting 
the military and changing his 
major from chemical engineering 
to psychology. His research later 
led him to the streets of New York 
and Washington. In the fall of 
1963 he witnessed an assault on a 
girl by several boys. He immedi
ately fought off the assailants but 
not before the girl was seriously 
injured.
With this incident preying on 
his mind, Mr. Storaska traveled to 
many universities seeking infor
mation on assaults. To his dismay 
little research had been initiated 
and he took matters into his own 
hands. In November of 1964 he
gave his first lecture and twelve 
weeks later a girl testified in a 
court trial for rape that her life had 
been saved by the information 
received when attending Mr. Storaskas lecture.
Mr. Storaska is proficient in 
Jujitsu, Judo, and Karate, having 
received instruction in these arts of 
self-defense while attending the 
Air Force Academys preparatory 
school in Bainbridge, Maryland. 
He now holds a black belt in 
Karate.
The lecture will be held on 
Tuesday, November 16th at 11:30 
in either the Wherret Room or the 
Skibo Ballroom.
Wednesday night, October 27, 
the Carnegie-Mellon String Quar
tet made its first concert appear
ance in the 1971-72 season, an 
appearance sadly unrecognized by 
the student body, for this 
ensemble is very capable of fine 
first-rate music. Sidney Harth, 
head of the music department and 
one of the finest violinists in the 
country, plays first violin. His 
wife, Theresa, second violinist 
with the Pittsburgh Symphony 
and a fine performer on her own, is 
second violin in the quartet. 
George Grossman, a Julliard gradu
ate and another member of the 
CMU music faculty, plays viola, 
and Theo Salzman, trained in 
Vienna and, again, from the CMU 
faculty, rounds out the quartet on 
cello. All of them are brilliant per
formers and combine personal 
talents into a strong, tight 
ensemble.
The concert opened with a 
Haydn string quartet, whose opus 
and key escape me, that showed 
definite foreshadowings of 
Romanticism, though coming 
from Haydns austere, dignified 
classicist era. Mr. Harth really 
shone on this one, and the groups 
performance of the closing presto 
was breathtaking, to say the least.
Next on the program was the
U.S. premiere of Geometrias by 
CMUs compose r-in-residence 
Leonardo Balada, a leading com
poser in com temporary Spanish 
music. In Geometrias, the quar
tet was arranged in a line facing the 
audience, rather than the usual 
closed square, enabling Mr. Balada 
to move the lines of music back 
and forth between performers in a 
stereophonic effect. The differ
ent movements were intended to 
depict various geometric ideas 
points, lines, triangles, etc., and 
was characterized by vigorous, 
agitated atonal figurations.
After an intermission, we were 
treated to a fine performance of 
Schuberts Traut quintet, with 
special guest artist Harry Franklin 
of the music faculty. The quartets 
interpretation somehow lacked 
fire, but the performers, especially 
Mr. Franklin, were very much in 
control of the music and it was an 
extremely well-done performance 
overall. Students here are missing a 
fine opportunity to hear a wide 
variety of good music performed 
by top-rank musicians.
Other musical events to look 
forward to:
Sunday, November 14, Mr. 
Donald Wilkins of the music facul
ty will give an organ recital at Cal
vary Episcopal Church, corner of
Shady and Wilkins, at 8:30 PM. 
Mr. Wilkins is a simply brilliant 
organist, having won first prize in 
organ at the Paris Conservatorie. 
His recital will probably include 
works by Bach, Buttehude, and 
Durufl.
On November 21, in Carnegie 
Music Hall at 8:30, the Cameron 
Choir will appear performing 
Bachs Cantata No. 106 with harp
sichord, flutes, and strings, and the 
Catulli Carmina by Carl Orff, a 
vigorous contemporary work 
scored for chorus, soloists, four 
pianos and extensive percussion.
Although no definite dates have 
been set, there will soon be a series 
of recitals by Mr. Wilkins and stu
dents on the new Casavant organ in 
the Fine Arts Building, room 109. 
The instrument was installed last 
fall and was completed in the 
spring by the Casavant Freres of 
Quebec. It is a novel organ in its 
design, in that the action between 
the keyboard and the individual 
pipes is not electrical, as in most 
organs, but is entirely mechanical. 
This feature is favored over elec
tronic action in modern organbuilding. Any CMU student with 
an interest in music can and should 
take the opportunity to hear it 
played.

PrePP sPids eeeei
It was a dull, dreary, damp 
morning. I looked out at Margaret 
Morrison College, through the 
large windows from the Skibo 
dining room. The Monday morn
ing feeling was hanging in the air. 
The quiet, steady hum of conversa
tion around me told me it was to 
be another hard week at CMU.
I looked closer at the people. 
These were my fellow students, 
my professors, and a staff of 
people trained to serve and help 
me. Each person was busily doing 
his own thing, trying desperately 
to finish his breakfast, get to class, 
and wake up. In that order.
The dress varied among the 
people, some wore jeans, some ca
sual, others jackets and ties. Some 
were members of the Left, others 
of the silent majority and, others 
of the Right.
As I looked around, I saw one 
common characteristic in this dis
tinct variety. No matter whether 
he was a long haired hippie freak or 
white shirt, bowtie, black tie-shoes 
man, each had a lighted cigarette in 
his hand.
I could not understand why 
young people, my age, were smo
king cigarettes. Didnt they know 
that it was bad for them? Didnt 
they know that smoking causes 
cancer? Were they willing to take

the chance to kill themselves?
I can understand why older 
people, people my parents age 
were smoking. I understand that 
they started to smoke before proof 
that smoking caused cancer. As a 
result, they are addicted to the 
smoking habit. But, younger 
people, know the facts.
And yet people ignore the facts. 
If you ask them why they smoke 
they answer, Yea, I know, but it 
wont happen to me. Can people 
be so naive.
Smoking can cause cancer. 
Each person who smokes is taking 
the chance that he will get cancer. 
The degree of cancer is determined 
by the amount of cigarettes 
smoked per day. People who 
smoke are more likely to get can
cer than non-smokers and yet 
people continue to smoke.
I looked around at the people 
once more. They all looked nor
mal, average, everyday people who 
do normal, average everyday 
things. Most were just finishing 
their breakfast; some just starting. 
The swarm was ready to depart to 
their respective duties. So was I. It 
was twenty five after eight. Must 
get to class. I finished my toast. 
Took a swallow of coffe. Crushed 
out my cigarette. And ran to class.

.M.Football i y , ,
The I. M. Football season has 
I ended and if you think youve read 
this story before, you have. Pika 
roared over Pepper & Salt for the 
I second time this year, 35-24. Not 
[since they lost a League game to 
1 the Old Men three years ago has 
| Pika been topped.
The semifinal round saw Pika 
coming from way down with 
twenty points.in the 4th quarter to 
! edge Beta, 37-35. It looked like 
Beta would finally stop the jinx 
that Pika has held over them. But 
two long Pika touchdowns in the
 &
last 3 minutes earned the win. The 
clincher came with only 42 sec
onds remaining as Benjamin hit 
Wright with a 23 yard pass.
The Black MajicPepper & Salt 
game was even more of a cliffhanger as it went to triple overtime 
before P&S pulled out the game 
45-41. When either team picked up 
a lead, the other would rebound to 
knot the score. The clincher was 
set up on pass interference as the 
three, and Rivers guided the ball in 
for the winner.
The championship game 
seemed anticlimactic as Pika led 
most of the way. They just out 
 played P&S, and swept to their 
third straight I. M. Football cham
pionship.
The consolation went to Beta 
38-31, over Black Majics.
.'Taxi came out on top of the 
intermediates, besting the Blawnox KC.
( VolleyballSAE came from 
behind to beat Beta for the Co-Rec 
championship. SAE won the first 
game 15-7, but lost the second 
15-11. The Sig Alphs were down 
7-2 and 11-7 before rallying to a 
15-11 win.
Soccer has started, bowling has 
started, squash, six-man, and 
waterpolo.

Varsity Soccer
After CMUs trip to the plate 
against Grove City on Saturday, 
there was no more joy in Pitts
burgh than there was that day in 
Mudville. The soccer team, which 
has literally and figuratively 
fought an uphill battle this year, 
had an undefeated skein broken at 
six games as they bowed to Grove 
City, 4-0.
Four days earlier, the booters 
had thoroughly trounced Pitt at 
Johnstown, 7-1 with the help of 
Peter Moses two goal perforstyle of soccer. At times the team 
did pass very well and control the 
action, but ultimately Grove Citys 
abandon and dept prevailed.
Pardon the error made last 
week in indicating that the soccer 
teams remaining three games were 
at home. The game against Grove 
City was not at home, either in 
terms of support or home field ad
vantage. There is little one can do 
about American support of soccer, 
its future is no clearer than many 
of todays issues. However, when 
the college, student body and admance. In a game which provided 
excellent opportunity for substitu
tion, the whole team saw action, 
and while David Gaudino and 
Dynamite Fred Yosua took 
command of the game, they were 
unable to match their big output 
of a year ago.
In the game against Grove City,
ministration alike, turns its back 
on one of its teams, the members 
of the same have to wonder if they 
are in fact representing a college. 
The soccer team has been insulted, 
to such an extent that they had to 
wear their away uniforms for a 
home game. CMU almost surely 
would have beaten Grove City had 
they been allowed to play on the 
stadium field. Is it always to be, 
Its not whether you win or lose,.
Peter Schuller
the booters were again without the 
services of fullback Mike Smith, 
and they were unable to turn back 
the offensive charge of their op
ponents. CMUs offense was gener
ally effective, but it failed to capi
talize on its numerous opportuni
ties. The team was not properly 
unified in its play and seemingly 
confused as to whether it wanted 
to challenge Grove Citys obvious 
size advantage or stick to its own
Varsity Rifle
The varsity rifle team is still un
defeated after their fourth match.
Their latest victories include 
W&J with Wray Paul, Lewis On, 
Ray Sears, Steve Roth, and Mike 
Pollock scoring the winning 1264 
points, and Grove City, 
(1315-1277) with Wray Paul, 
Norm Cable, Steve Roth, John 
Panasewicz, and Ozzie Kemp 
scoring the top five scores.
The varsity rifle team will try 
for their fifth win on November 
6th against Geneva.
