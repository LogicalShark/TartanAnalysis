Last Tuesday evening's Student Senate meeting dealt 
with several items of new business. First, however. Joe 
Duckworth made a report on the activities of the commit
tee established to study the drafting of a new Campus 
Code. This committee, composed of three students, three 
faculty, and Dean Swank, came into existence when it was 
felt that there was a need for reform of the campus dis
ciplinary processes. The students had hoped that all par
ties concerned would be amenable to the formation of a 
single disciplinary body composed of students as well as 
faculty and administration. Duckworth told the Senate, 
however, that the faculty had been unwilling to submit to 
any trial system involving students. This left open the pos
sibility that parallel disciplinary bodies would be estab
lished. making students responsible to students, faculty 
members to faculty, and so on.
The first item of new business involved a motion on 
the part of Tom Morrison to freeze the budget of the re
cent campus publication The Relative Truth. His general 
objection was that the paper was in poor taste and that it 
gave only one side of the political picture. Another sena
tor countered that his dismay with The Relative Truth re
sulted not from its offensiveness but from the poor jour
nalistic quality of the articles. One senator who had been 
involved in the publication of the paper reminded the Sen
ate that the policy of the publication was to accept any ar
ticle from any student, as long as it was clear, and re
gardless of political standpoint. Coupled with Joe Duck
worth's unwillingness to set a precedent of censorship, 
the motion was defeated.
The next item dealt again with the Campus Code. 
Having learned of the facultys refusal to be disciplined by 
a body of which students were a part. Steve Rosenberg 
read a motion declaring that the students support the no
tion of parallel judicial systems for faculty and students 
and which reasserted that all non-academic discipline of 
students be conducted by students. Since the community 
discipline notion had already been rejected, the motion 
carried 26-4-6.
A motion was then heard on whether to add a day to 
next April's Easter holiday, or simply add Easter Mon
day and drop another day. This action would prevent stu
dents from having to travel on Easter Sunday. Dean Swank 
pointed out that calendar changes were very difficult this 
late in the year and the motion was subsequently amend
ed into the form of a suggestion. This passed 23-6-5.
The next item of business involved a plea on the part 
of Dean Swank for the Student Senate to watch its own 
budget for next year very carefully. He described the 
schools financial situation as being somewhat precari
ous at the moment and stressed the need for careful plan
ning in the development of the new budget.
One motion, to appropriate $80 to bring The Group, a 
company of amateur actors to the C-MU campus, and an
other. on budget procedures, were tabled to committee. 
At this time Chairman Pat Cavanagh appointed an ad hoc

C-MU students may go on record as the first ones ever 
to throw marshmallows at a U.S. Senator. The target of a 
handful of vociferous antagonists in the audience in the 
Skibo Ballroom was the Republican Senator from South 
Carolina, Strom Thurmond, who spoke here on Tuesday. 
Jan. 20. The Senator survived the barrage and later said. 
"Ive never seen anything like it."
The first speaker on the schedule of the Activities 
Board of distinguished lecturers, the Senator spoke to an 
audience which was determined to hear him despite fre
quent interruptions by persistant detractors. Senator 
Thurmond spoke on topics ranging from electoral reforms 
to welfare and did not fail to demonstrate why he is called 
The Perfect Conservative by the Americans for Con
stitutional Action.
On military spending he stressed the need for contin
ued military preparedness as long as the "Dictators in 
the Kremlin pursue their goal of world domination. 
Speaking about President Nixon and the war in Vietnam 
the Senator defended the administrations policies blam
ing previous Presidents for increasing U.S. involvement 
to the extent that only gradual withdrawal is now feasible. 
If previous administrations had acted accordingly, the 
Vietnam war could have been ended in six months, the 
Senator said. Shouts of "End the War interrupted his de
fense of President Nixon whom he described as doing the 
best he can to bring an honorable end to the war.
Laughter and more heckling greeted his remark that 
welfare should be administered to people who are willing 
to take training. Through training, welfare recipients can 
get jobs and get off welfare.
The Senator's remark on big government being the 
biggest threat to freedom elicited mixed reactions from 
those who were aware of his unsuccessful campaign for 
the Presidency in 1948 as a States' Right candidate and 
from those who are reminded of the trial of Bobby Seale 
and the Chicago Seven.
Senator Thurmond did not appear disturbed by the 
few hecklers in a crowd of 500 but made frequent refer
ence during his talk to an opening remark that he favored 
dissent but I think it is a disgrace to allow a handful of 
people to disrupt a meeting just as I think it is a disgrace 
for a handful of radicals to disrupt the opportunity of 
others to get an education in our colleges today."

The housing shortage at Carnegie-Mellon University 
could reach critical proportions by 1975. This is the pro
jection of the User s Committee for Planning New Cam
pus Housing based on the enrollment estimates of Drs. 
Kibbee and Schatz.
The report was delivered last Monday to the Trus
tee's Committee on Student Affairs. The Users Commit
tee was initiated by the Trustees and organized through 
the Division of Student Affairs following requests by stu
dents for accelerated planning.
Represented on the committee are all segments of 
the campus community, five undergraduates (two AWS. 
two MDC. one student senate, two graduate students

Senator Strom Thurmond would have proved to be foolish 
by his speech and on his record. Unfortunately, several students 
felt they must help him. Thus, with the aid of marshmallows 
and heckling they succeeded in disrupting the lecture and an
noying the majority of listeners. Arguing, if one may call Tues
days display that, by noise and command only demonstrates 
that the ability to use reason is weak.
There have been several ramifications of the demonstra
tion. Senator Thurmond, for one, probably left C-MU re-con
firming his belief in the necessity of federal control over the 
disruption of University campuses. He and some others who wit
nessed the lecture came away with the opinion that the Left 
was hypocritical; that student radicals displayed undemocratic 
conduct in support of democracy, perverted free speech in sup
port of that guaranteed right. Members of the University com
munity in discussion and debate clouded the real issue of Thur
monds philosophy and actions by arguing about the tactics used 
to demonstrate differences. In addition, many mass media pub
lications have used this episode as only another in the long 
stream of examples to prove the irrationality and irresponsibil
ity of the intellectual elite.
Thurmonds appearance here had no educational value. Cer
tainly, no one entered the Ballroom thinking that he could change 
the Senators attitude; certainly the Senator could not believe 
that he would strongly influence ours. If the purpose of his lec
ture was to present another point of view, that too failed. For, 
not only did we not listen but he did not present any new or dif
ferent perspective to the views of the Right. His speech was 
spiked with warn-out phrases and inane logic. Who here could 
believe in the Senators definition Or interpretation of inflation? 
Unfortunately, Thurdmonds faulty arguments and opinions pro
cured more sympathy than good arguments put forth roughly, 
insolently, and noisily.
The University as a place where free discussion and flow of 
ideas can occur may be an admirable conception. But this epi
sode and others have indicated that it is not a fact of life. Sadly, 
students have arrived at the point where they no longer believe 
they are being heard. They, therefore, believe in turn they need 
not listen. Abbie Hoffman and Doctor Spock may receive stand
ing ovations no matter how dull or unintelligible their arguments 
may be. The point is that they agree with us, they are part of 
the movement.
If the campus mood will not permit those who present op
posing views to appear, those who want to hear those views will 
have to get them elsewhere. There is simply no benefits to bring
ing a man here only to be ridiculed and silenced.
Perhaps there is alternative. The Senator represents to 
many the oppressive and repressive forces present in America. 
He represents all that many consider bad. It was not only what 
he said, but what he stands for and how he defends himself, that 
brought such violent opposition. Perhaps what we should aim 
for now in bringing different views to the University is people 
who can defend their beliefs intelligently, without the connota
tions which Senator Thurmons name evokes.
Would William Buckley have provoked the same response?

ing of general problems of cam
pus housing through a study of 
available literature on the subject, 
emphasizing qualitiative aspects 
of student living. Individual com
mittee members developed sur
veys and questionnaires to ana
lyze the preference of various 
constitutencies.
Recognizing both the financial 
problems of all construction and 
those specific limitations of fed
eral asistance which have given 
us such facilities as Donner and 
Hammerschlag Halls, the com
mittee invited Richard Strathmeyer, vice president for Business 
Affairs, to discuss these matters. 
Options in ownership and financong the impact of present inter
est rates and both the sources and 
allocation priorities of University 
funds were considered.
The committee has been meet
ing regularly since Oct. 16, 1969. 
In its final report, to be present
ed by May 1, the committee hopes 
to resolve such issues as the much 
increased desire for apartmentstyle units, techniques for influ
encing large-scale private devel
opment of student housing in Oak
land and the particularly critical 
finances of graduate, married and 
financial aid students.
Although the surveys thus far 
completed have revealed signifi
cant trends in housing needs, ad
ditional comments are very wel
come and may be sent to the Users 
Committee for Planning New 
Campus Housong, c o the Divi
sion of Student Affairs. Warner

Senate
(Continued from Page 1)
committee to study student rep
resentation on the Board of Trus
tees.
Finally, but not inconsequential
ly. a motion called the Free 
Speech Resolution was read. Part 
of the resolution read:
We, the Student Senate . . . 
show our disapproval of the stu
dent instigators during the recent 
visit of Senator Strom Thurmond. 
We hereby publicly censure those 
students who had not the common 
sense or courtesy to allow Sena
tor Thurmond to speak without 
heckling and interruption.
A fair amount of discussion en
sued and Senator Tom Burgess, 
who had been a part of the heck
ling group, defended the inter
ruptions as a political action, the 
1 unction of which was to make it 
clear to Senator Thurmond that 
even on a small inconspicuous 
campus such as ours that opposi
tion to his policies is great. The 
resolution, however, was passed 
with only two dissenting and sev
eral abstaining votes. At 6:15 p.m. 
the meeting was adjourned.

At the Tuesday meeting of Stu
dent Senate the following actions 
were taken:
1. A motion, recognizing the 
right of free speech, censuring 
those students who had not the 
common sense or courtesy to al
low Senator Thurmond to speak 
without heckling and interrup
tion.' was passed 23-3-4. A roll 
call vote was taken.
2. A motion calling the alloca
tion of $2,487.50 to the Relative 
Truth a gross mistake and call
ing for the corrective actions of
1.) freezing their budget; b.) re
moving any unspent money and 
placing it in a reserve for any 
other student organizations, and 
c. t make public a detailed account 
of all funds transacted by the or
ganization. was defeated 5-23-3.
3. A motion stating the Senates 
opinion that: a.) all non-academic 
disciplinary procedures concern
ing students should be adminis
tered by students only; b.) nonacademic disciplinary regulations 
and procedures should rest only 
with those members of the aca
demic community affected by 
these regulations and procedures 
and supporting the principle of 
parallel judicial systems for stu
dents and faculty and recognizing 
the importance of due process in 
all campus disciplinary procedrues, was passed 26-4-6.
4 A motion was passed < 28-0-21 
directing President Duckworth 
and Chairman Cavanagh to indi
cate that the intent of the above 
motion is to make a compromise 
of the Senates principles as stat
ed in that and previous motions so 
that a workable campus code can 
be quickly developed. Passage of 
the above motion is not intended 
to indicate a modification of the 
Senates basic stance towards a 
campus code stated in previous 
motions. We will continue to 
work towards those goals in the 
long run, the motion stated
5. A motion passed (23-5-6) rec
ommending to the Educational Po
licy Council that either an extra 
day be added onto Easter vacation 
or that an earlier day be dropped 
and added onto the end of the va
cation, in order that students not 
be forced to travel during Easter 
Day.

The amiss was even more amiss than usual the 
day Richard J. Daley acted his hours in the court 
room of the Conspiracy Sevenin the court room of 
the seven men who were assigned responsibility 
for the outbursts that accompanied Chicago's 1968 
National Democratic convention. Richard J. Daley, 
defense witness 42., was fascinatingly executed. A 
near-perfect non-drama from beginning to end.
When he glided into U.S. District Judge Julius 
J. Hoffmans chambers, it became apparent that 
Daley holds more than mere honorary claim to the 
position of Chicagos principle character. In court, 
he lived up to his reputation. He was both controlled 
and in control throughout the day.
Since Daley was subpoenaed by the defense as 
a defense witness, it was the perogative of only the 
prosecution to pose leading questions. In order 
to get at essential issues, the defendants had 
hoped to use the legal technicality of having their 
own witness declared hostile. When a witness is 
declared hostile, the side who called the witness 
is free to pose "leading questions. Judge Hoffman, 
who termed Daley "a most friendly witness. would 
not. and. of course, did not declare Daley hostile.
Daley glided into the court room; without paus
ing for trumpets to herald his presence, he glided 
past the chain cord which had separated spectators 
from participants. Without pausing to prostrate 
himself before the judge, he defiantly glided to the 
witness stand. Without waiting for the edict, he 
stood with his right hand perched in the air. Daley 
was ready and able for his public performance.
Perhaps as memorable as his dramatically undramatic entrance was the rest of his casually rig
id performance as defense witness number 42. He 
came off not as such a pig. but more as motionless, 
normal witness number 42. His since boyhood 
friendship with the prosecuting attorney was un
derplayed. The fact that he appoints all key Chicago 
officials except those who are appointed by Daley 
appointees was skimmed over. The fact that he has 
been Chicago's mayor since 1955 was hurriedly 
passed by. He became such a normal, soft-spoken 
witness that the judge several times had to ask him 
to speak up.
When he finished bearing his soul to the de
fense. testifying to being mayor of the city of Chi
cago. leader of the Cook Cojnty Democratic Com
mittee and proud of it and explaining that he 
thinks prosecution attorney Foran is one of the 
greatest attorneys in this country and the finest 
man I have met in private and public life. Daley 
answered the two questions posed by the prosecu
tion. To Foran's inquiry about whether the mayor
ever suggested that march and park permits be 
denied in August of 1968. Daley said. No. To 
the prosecutions. Did you tell anyone when the 
YIPPIES and the Mobilization filed their suits, now 
they'll never get permits. Daley also answered. 
"No." And those, apparently, are the only things 
Daley had been prepared to say.
When Daley didnt seem anxious to answer a 
question, he didnt open his mouth. Foram wouldi 
immediately object to the question and quickly be 
sustained.
The drama took place after a series of building 
moments. After the defense accused Daley of pack
ing the public part of the spectators section with 
his own people. After Judge Hoffman refused to poll 
the public section to ascertain whether or not the 
defense claim had any basis. It happened when Da
ley and at least 20 federal marshals, simultaneous
ly glided into the court room. Afther that, a mar
shall heard a spectator hiss. Instantaneouslyeven 
before the jury could be ordered to leaveseven 
"marshals surrounded the perpetrater of the 
noise. The "marshals weren't overly careful to 
avoid bumping and stepping on spectators. Specta
tors rebelled bv saying. "It's Chicago all over 
again.
The comedy took place quite abruptly. Before 
the jury returned from luncheon recess, things 
were on the usual state of informal confusion. "Con
spirator" Abbie Hoffman spotted "power wielder" 
Richard Daley. Hoffman saw Daley and said. Hey. 
let s settle this right now . . . me and you . . . It 
was like a revelation to Daley. He laughed. He for
got for a second. For a second he seemed to relate 
to Abbie Hoffman. Or at least to his language. As 
usual, the ban on laughter was issued.
Daley had at least one dramtic trick up his 
sleeve. When the defense listed what it had hoped to 
prove had it been given the chance to ask leading " 
questions. Daley didn't answer. He didnt respond 
when Kuntsler said there had been a conspiracy be
tween Mayor Daley and the Democratic adminis
tration of Lyndon Johnson to prevent any signifi
cant demonstration against "war. poverty, impperialism. racism. He didn't respond when Kuntsler 
accused him of obtaining and maintaining power in 
Chicago bv the creation and maintenance of a cor
rupt political machine. He didnt respond when 
Kuntsler talked about Mayor Daley's April 15. 1968, 
order to his police to shoot to kill arsonist and to 
shoot to main or cripple looters in the Black com
munity. He didnt respond when the defense accus
ed Mayor Daley and his administrators of victim
izing and harrassing for years members of both the 
Black and the young community. Defense witness 
number 42 used silence as his controlling cue.

World's greatest living pantomimist, Marcel Marceau, is seen 
to the left as the loveable "Bip"the character which he created 
in 1947 to symbolize in the "art of silence" the foibles and fancies 
of human beings. Bip's misadventures will form, with Marceau's 
famous style pantomimes, a program which is offered by Activities 
Board on Feb. 18 at Syria Mosque as part of his seventh American 
tour.

by Chuck Daly
Two points must be made with 
regard to Senator Strom Thur
mond's talk of Jan. 20. For those 
who did not attend. I must say that 
the entire spectacle was a tragedy 
which needn't have happened. One 
might easily have place the scene 
as that of an elementary school af
ter a long day of unstimulating 
classes. I never, up until Tuesday, 
had suspected that our education
al system had been such a grave 
failure in its attempts to encour
age the development of a critical 
mind.
A sizable portion of the blame" 
for the failure of the program 
must go to both the Activities 
Board and Senator Thurmond. 
Thurmond presented neither any 
original thoughts on the current 
political scene nor any rationale 
behind the views he holds. He 
merely re-stated views that an in
terested party might find in any 
current periodical. Senator Thur
mond should have realized this 
and given us something which we 
might be willing to listen to even 
though we might not agree with it. 
But this has been a common fail
ure of this year's Activities Board.
The only speaker who present
ed anything relatively original 
was Arthur Schlesinger. The 
others merely recapitulated facts 
which any "well-informed'' citi
zen should be aware of. I was cri
ticized for my negative rhetoric 
on Werner von Braun. Werner did
n't tell me anything new. Neither 
did Strom Thurmond. Neither pos
sessed sufficient magnetism to 
bring to my knees in adulation.
But the young anarchist who 
continually interrupted the talk 
might wonder why Thurmond. Agnew and others threaten repres
sion of your actions. It is because 
of you, gentlemen. I would venture 
that you would react similarily if 
placed in the same position. You 
claim to seek a better world but 
your actions dont bear that out. 
You ask for freedom of speech, 
but wouldn't let Thurmond speak. 
You profess love, but I only saw 
hate. Perhaps we need a revolu
tion. but not yours. Before you de
stroy "the Establishment, I sug
gest you offer something positive 
in its place besides your contra
dicted virtues.
"And is you want money for people
with minds that hate,
"Well all I can tell you is 'Brother,
you'll have to wait.

The Security and Safety Depart
ment maintains the University's 
only Lost and Found facility. 
Items which are turned in to the 
Security and Safety Department 
are held until claimed, returned to 
the finder, or released to the Al
pha Phi Omega fraternity for pub
lic sale. The more valuable items 
are held for a minimum of 60 days 
before release to anyone other 
than the original owner.
A property number is assigned 
to each item received, and an in
dex card filing system maintain
ed. The index cards contain such 
information as the name of the 
finder, the location at which the 
item was either lost or found, a 
description of the item, dates and 
times. This information is also en
tered into a record book. A simi
lar file is maintained for lost 
items. Above is a sample of the 
index card.Yu-Y9CA
Under Fire
The Repression Program of 
Saturday had at least one immedi
ate result. The campus YM-YWCA 
found itself under fire for their 
support of the program.
The campus office and the met
ropolitan offices of both groups 
received calls from members who 
felt the action was inappropriate 
for the "Y." Freedom of speech, 
in their thinking, did not extend 
to people who oppose the Ameri
can way of life and advocate rev
olution. Several stated that they 
would never again contribute to 
the Community Chest, which sup
ports Y activities.
On Friday morning, the day 
prior to the program, the metro
politan YMCA office received a 
phone calll from a member of the 
American Brothers Committee, a 
veterans group. The caller threat
ened that unless the Y withdrew 
its backing, his group would take 
out full-page advertisements in 
the Pittsburgh papers exposing 
the Y as un-American and advis
ing veterans to no longer support 
it.
The staffs of the metropolitan Y 
reaffiremed the rectitude of C-MU 
Y's actions. The C-MU Ys played 
a valuable supportive role on Sat
urday. On Monday morning the 
representative of the American 
Brothers called, denounced the 
Saturday affair as filthy, and an
nounced the committees intention 
to carry out their threat. District 
29 of the VFW also called and an
nounced that they too would take 
action, apparently at the Broth
er's prompting.
The Y offices are now awaiting 
further development in the con
troversy.
Xerox:
For engineers 
who think 
of more than 
engineering.
There's one in every crowd. A Doug King, 
who'd rather do something than talk 
about it. By vocation, Doug's a Manager 
(Test Engineering) for Xerox. By avocation, 
a teacher of functional illiterates. By 
instinct, an unabashed do-gooder. "I ust 
feel that if one person can be effective 
Editto effectiveit's better than 100 
people sitting in a meeting."
The wish being father to the deed, Doug 
involved himself in inner-city programs 
and Rochester's Business Opportunities 
Operation. Doug teaches adults with less 
than a sixth grade education to readon 
a 1 -to-1 basis, just teacher and pupil. He 
went about this in the same professional 
way he tackles his daily work. He first took 
a course in how to become a teacher.
Now, he's training fledgling instructors.
On the business side, one of the persons 
under his wing had never been anything 
more than a janitor. Doug helped him 
secure a franchise from a national rugcleaning company. It's successful, too. As 
Doug puts it: "For the first time in his life, 
this fellow finally has a stake in something. 
And he knows if he needs help or advice, 
it's there for the asking."
Doug also benefits from his avocation. For 
one thing, he's more patient. More 
understanding of society's so-called 
problem children. He knows why they are 
what they areand what they can be.
At Xerox, we like people like Doug King. 
Engineers who can see beyond 
engineering. Engineers who can feel for 
humanity. Engineers who seek additional 
outlets for their talents.
If you're this kind of engineer, we'd like 
to talk to you. Your degree in Engineering 
or Science may qualify you for some 
intriguing openings in a broad spectrum 
of developmental and manufacturing 
areas.
We're located in suburban Rochester, 
New York. See your Placement Director 
for a copy of our brochure and for the 
date of our scheduled campus interviews.

Rap on Womens Lib
Pittsburgh Women's Liberation decided on Tuesday. Jan. 20, to 
branch into another kind of activity. In addition to continuing their bi
weekly meetings to plan political action (day care centers, birth con
trol dissemination, protests of anti-women attitudes) a new rap session 
program composed of small groups of women has been set up for the 
purpose of getting ourselves together. The smaller groups are in
tended to help our sisters to discuss freely those problems and experi
ences which arise from a social system that discriminates, however 
subtly, against women (channeling out of a career and into the home, 
expected role as a passive being, deference to men in most group 
situations).
C-MU women on Wednesday, Jan. 28, in the Y-office. 57 Skibo. for 
a rap session. Any interested women who want to help us get it together 
are invited and needed.

Nylon. Reverse osmosis.
A fiber that started making girls' legs more beauti
ful some 30 years ago.
And a process thats been around a lot longer.
But when Du Pont scientists and engineers look 
at them in a new way, they combine into an idea that 
can change the world.
Reverse osmosis is a purification process that 
requires no phase change. Its potentially the cheap
est way to desalinate water.
Du Pont's innovation? Hollow, semipermeable ny
lon fibers much finer than human hair. Symmetrical, 
with an outer diameter of .002 inch and a wall thick
ness of .0005 inch, with an accuracy of manufacture 
maintained at close to 100%. Twenty-five to 30 million 
of them encased in a precisely engineered unit 14 
inches in diameter by 7 feet long.
The result: a semipermeable surface area of about 
85,000 square feetthe size of a 2-acre lotand up 
to 10,000 gallons of desalted water per day.
So far Permasep permeators have been used 
experimentally to purify brackish and polluted water, 
and in various industrial separations. But the po
tential to desalt seawater, too, is there.
So Du Pont scientists and engineers are even now 
working toward improved fibers, units and plant 
designs that should make it possible to get fresh 
water from salt at a price that any town or nation 
can afford.
Innovationapplying the known to discover the 
unknown, inventing new materials and putting them 
to work, using research and engineering to create 
the ideas and products of the futurethis is the 
venture Du Pont people are now engaged in.
For a variety of career opportunities, and a chance 
to advance through many fields, talk to your Du Pont 
Recruiter. Or send us the coupon.

AN INTERVIEW IS LIKE A BLIND DATE.
You invest some time and effort. And once in a while, you 
come up with a great relationship.
Many engineers find a truly rewarding relationship begins in 
an interview with the Carrier Air Conditioning Company 
representative. He's looking for a particular kind of engineer. 
One who will bring to work a mature brand of enthusiasm 
for taking things apart to see what makes them tick.
We'll help you turn that talent into the ability to design, make, 
and market air conditioning units of every conceivable 
nature. Equipment that cools everything from a bedroom to 
an Astrodome. We're the largest manufacturer of air 
conditioning products in the world. And we're looking for the 
new men who will keep us at the head of the pack.
We need Product Development Engineers. Production 
Engineers. Sales Engineers. Service Engineers. You might be 
one of them. Talk to our representative. He'll be on campus ...

The Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration (GSIAi has joined 
nine other leading graduate 
schools of management in a con
certed effort to increase the flow 
of black and other minority per
sons into significant managerial 
positions.
The ten schools have formed the 
Council for Opportunity in Grad
uate Management Education, 
which seeks to increase the 
awareness of minority group 
members of the relevance of Mas
ter's programs as the link be
tween undergraduate college ex
perience and careers in manage
ment. The Council has received a 
grant of $1,000,000 from the Al
fred P. Sloan Foundation to sus
tain its first year operation.
According to Richard M. Cyert. 
dean of GSIA, "The existence of 
the Council will broaden the base 
of dinancial support for minority 
students through a program of 
graduate fellowships. It will also 
help the participating schools sus
tain and strengthen their present 
programs for minority students."
The GSIA dean cited a recent 
survey of 15 graduate manage
ment schools which disclosed that 
only 2.5 per cent of the nearly 8.- 
000 students were black and that 
other minorities were even more 
poorly represented.
Some of the efforts planned by 
GSIA of which are already under
wav are:
Move as quickly as possible to 
achieve a minimum 10 per 
cent black representation in the 
Master of Science program.
Cooperation with the National 
Scholarship Service Foundation 
for Negro Students . to recruit 
black students- with back
grounds in mathematics and 
physical sciences necessary to 
a candidate's success at GSIA. 
This effort has been in effect for 
two years.
Visits to Southern campuses 
with predominantly black en
rollments. Alphonse Whitfield, 
an alumnus of GSIA and mana
ger of the electric vehicle de
partment of Westinghouse Elec
tric Corp.. and two black stu
dents at GSIA. Eric Mitchell 
and William Baitey. have been 
working with GSIA faculty 
members in this area. This ef
fort has been going on for two 
years also.
Other members of the Council 
include: the Graduate School of 
Business Administration. Univer
sity of California. Berkeley: the

Its only one of the imaginative ways 
you can use your talent at Norden. 
Because here, we see things a bit 
differently. Technologically. Crea
tively. And in business.
One example is the Contact Analog 
system you see above. Displaying al
titude, air speed, attitude, velocity 
vector, and other flight information 
into easily-assimilated pictorial form. 
With virtually limitless applications 
for air/spacecraft, on land, or under 
sea.
Interesting? We think so. But what jt 
says about Norden may interest you 
more.
Technologically, Contact Analog rep
resents a sophisticated utilization of 
analog and digital techniques, illus
trating the kind of interdisciplinary 
activity thats made our team prob
lem-solving approach so successful. 
Creatively, it demonstrates the fact 
that new ideaseven radical ones
