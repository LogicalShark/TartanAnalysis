Student organizations have been re
quested to remove all old posters, ads, or 
events notices from the walls near bulletin 
board areas. Discussing a recent circular 
that defines the new policy, Earle Swank, 
Dean of Student Affairs, called this en
forcement necessary to make bulletin 
boards more useful. Richard Van Horn, 
Chief Officer of Operations, agreed that if 
old notices are not taken down by stu
dents, maintenance staff will remove all 
materials from undesignated areas.
Prior to issuing the circular Dean Swank 
talked to Student Senate about the posterremoval issue and asked student organiza
tions to notify him if they felt present 
bulletin board space was inadequate. New 
boards were to be installed if student 
opinion expressed the need. He cited War
ner Hall as one of those places in need of a 
bulletin board, to alleviate the expensive 
cleanup involved when posters are glued to 
the glass surfaces of doors and windows 
and must be scraped off to be removed. It 
will cost $3.46 an hour just to pay the 
custodians who do the cleaning.
The concern about the campus clutter 
and Swanks proposal to clean up the en
vironment result from the complaint of a 
former Tartan editor, now a member of the 
Student Affairs Trustee Committee. At 
the January committee meeting, he ex
plained how the students dont seem to 
care about the appearance of Baker Hall 
and Skibo. The former editor admitted he 
complained frequently about how the stu
dents do nothing to clean what he called 
the old administration building and dis
liked students leaving traces of soda and 
food wrappers in the classrooms.
Dean Swank mentioned the difficulty in 
asking the alumni for contributions when 
they notice campus clutter. Students are 
asked to eliminate waste paper accumula
tion in face of the universitys recent cut
back of custodial staff.
The dean said that poster restrictions 
are nothing new. Previously the university 
tried to enforce poster controls. All mater
ial needed a stamp of approval from the 
Activities Coordination Office. The original 
purpose of the approval rule was to keep 
poster size smaller than 11 by 14 inches. 
Approval regulation never effectively con
trolled the slew of materials plastered on 
the walls because the Activities Office 
simply stamped everything. The only quali
fication was that anything that escaped 
stamping was removed by custodians.
Sue Christian, assistant director of Stu
dent Activities, mentioned that there has 
always been a university regulation con
cerning poster-placement and that posters 
were not to be applied to glass surfaces or

Underdog Sigma Nus freerolling won
der of a buggy, Hornet, shattered the 
Sweepstakes record by nearly a full second, 
with a blistering 2:20.2 performance in 
Saturdays Sweepstakes. Dethroned 
two-year champion Phi Kappa Thetas 
Streak finished second in 2:22.0, with 
Beta Theta Pis SST taking third at 
2:22.8. All three times were improved over 
the preliminary heats.
It had been generally expected that, 
owing to a long-awaited paving of Tech 
Street, at least one new record would be 
established. The old standard of 2:20.9 was 
set in 1968 by Pi Kappa Alphas Tiger 
Shark II.
Alpha Tau Omegas A buggy,Ganander, won Saturdays consolation heat in 
a relatively slow 2:28.5. Pi Kappa Alphas 
2:29.4 in the Pi-thon gave them fifth 
place, while ATO B rounded out the top 
six with 2:31.8 in the Golden Goose.
Sigma Nu also had the fastest prelim
inary time on Friday, turning in a 2:21.4 
which missed the record by only half a 
second. Beta and Phi Kap qualified for the 
finals with respective marks of 2:22.9 and 
2:23.7. Runners-up ATO A (2:25.7), 
PiKA (2:27.0), and ATO B (2:30.0) aU 
had faster times than they did on Saturday.
A 45-minute protest after Heat 5 Friday 
morning almost deprived fans of the first 
course record in six years. Delta Tau Delta 
lodged an official complaint that Sigma Nu 
had had a house member running beside its
Sigma Nu croatas tha finish lina for a course record of 2:20.2
Hill 5 pusher to pace him. Charges were 
dropped, however, when it was established 
that the runner, a SN flag man, was behind 
the pusher and therefore not even visible to 
him.
When asked what contributed most to 
the spectacular performance of underrated 
Sigma Nu (though it finished fourth last 
year, third the year before, it wasnt con
sidered to be on the powerhouse level), a 
house spokesman said, Weve got the tech
nology that everyone else just talks about. 
He wouldnt go further, though, except to 
say that certain minor improvements had 
been made for this year.
However, Dave Kanner, Buggy Publicity
Chairman, said he thinks the Hornets 
light aluminum construction is a big part of 
its advantage, as it allows the pushe to 
shove the buggy ahead of him and then 
catch up, as with a bicycle.
The Hornet was timed at about 50 
seconds in the freeroll on Friday, and it is 
thought that it must have done at least that 
well in the final to have broken the record. 
Sixty seconds is considered a decent free
roll time.
SNs push team included Clark Henky 
(Hill 1), John Stern (Hill 2), John Stepanic 
(Hill 3), Dan Meess (Hill 4), and Marion 
Zankowski at the Hill 5 anchor spot. Its 
driver was Bob. H. B. StevensonCi
adding a midsemester holiday, a home
coming holiday, and a reading period to 
the fall semester for the next two years.
Total ballots cast in the election de
clined for the third straight semester, even 
though Senate placed a poll on Spring 
Carnival midway. 503 students voted last 
Wednesday and Thursday, compared with 
the 675 who voted in the previous presi
dential race a year ago.
Several students who werent on the 
ballot won office by receiving two writein votes apiece.
Senate elections supervisor, David 
Groupe, said that the turnout was reason
ably good considering this year Senate did 
not borrow the voting machines used in 
previous spring elections.
This election marked several departures 
from past practice. Senate eliminated poll
ing places devoted exclusively to Fine Arts 
and Graduate students and put its booth 
on Spring Carnival Midway from 5 p.m. to 
10 p.m. Thursday night. Groupe reported 
only one complaint against cutting the 
polls.continued on page 14

There is a possibility that Mellon In
stitute parking lot may jiot exist next year. 
Construction may begin on a proposed 
hotel-apartment complex on the University 
property.
We are going to sell parking spaces at 
Mellon Institute but we are not promising 
spaces there.clarified Sylvia Austin of the 
parking office. I dont know what they 
are going to do if parking is limited next 
year due to construction, she continued.
One alternative might be to give spaces 
in the More wood Gardens parking lot and 
set up a shuttle system to transport people 
to Mellon Institute.
Presently, the parking office is planning 
to sell spaces at Mellon Institute for next 
year at a rate of $40 per space. No 
premium rate will be charged because the 
Institute lot is not an over-demand lot. An 
average of 245 people park at Mellon In
stitute now.

Last week, students from the archi
tecture department were busy constructing 
large wooden trusses on the cut between 
Baker and Doherty Halls. These structures 
were part of a project assigned to the fresh
man architecture class for the spring 
semester. The project was a competition 
where teams of students designed and built 
structures capable of raising a bucket of 
water 30 feet and then lowering it without 
spilling any of the water. The last team to 
erect their structure on Wednesday after
noon was composed of six women. There 
are only six women in the freshman class 
of 57 students. It was the faculty, not the 
students , who chose the teams.
What possible reasons are there for this 
separation?
Was it considered a more valuable learn
ing experience for the students?
Are we to assume this was a test? Mean
ing that the women must prove they are 
the same as men students?
Why didnt these professors further 
divide the class into other groups such as 
short people, green-eyed people, fat 
people, Jewish people or Black people?
Why is this project being used as an 
example of work by the Architecture de
partment of CMU, by inviting the tele
vision media to film the structure building 
process? Did the department give no con
sideration to what type of image this was 
projecting to the public about women at 
CMU and the Architecture department?
I have always been very happy that 
women were accepted as equally dedicated 
and capable students by the men students 
and most of the faculty. The experience of 
women working with men on an equal 
basis is I believe a very positive one for all 
people involved. There are fortunately only 
a few members of the faculty who do not 
have such a favorable view of women as
piring toward the professions. But in 
general I have felt there were good atti
tudes towards women here on both the
departmental and university levels.
This incident is a clear case of discrimin
ation and has made me seriously question 
my hitherto good feelings about womens 
status at this university.

A Question and a Compliment
The present undergraduate catalog has expired and its replacement is 
currently at the printerstdue to arrive in the middle of the summer recess. 
H&SS recently changed its unit system in a huff in order to make the 
printing deadline, yet the individual college decisions on how the new 
system will effect requirements for graduation were made after this 
deadline, is the next two year catalog outdated before its publication? 
Will the applicants to this University be shown an outdated image of 
CMU so as to conserve on expenditures?
Two years ago, when / began my journalistic career at CarnegieMellon, / vowed / would never publish a review since / felt that my 
musical experience was not strong enough for me to tell a general 
community what / thought of a particular artistic endeavor.
Last Saturday Nights John Sebastian concert reviewed itself. / dont 
need any great musical knowledge to know when / was totally engrossed 
by a concert or even more importantly to sense the uniform feeling of 
satisfaction that infected the 1200 or so people in the Music Hall that 
evening.
Unlimited praise has to be offered to Rick Wertheimer and the AB for 
providing the evening that ended the successful Spring Carnival '74. To 
those that feel the AB should have its budget cut because it doesnt serve a 
majority of the campus, all that can be said is that the service rendered to 
those accepting it more than makes up for those that sit home and 
complain that there is nothing to do.
Three standing ovations, and an audience assembled into a uniform 
mass of dapping and screaming, can only show that despite the current 
financial preoccupation of all parts of this university, quality still persists.

I am outraged to learn that the Admin
istration of Carnegie-Mellon University is 
working hand-in-hand with the Allegheny 
County Regional Narcotics Task Force in 
an effort to put students in jail for smoking 
marijuana. Not satisfied with the results 
of the infamous February Bust, they are 
planning a Spring Carnival Spectacular. 
Charles V. Williams, Dean of Men, 
announced at a recent UFO meeting that 
the pigs will be making a lot of new arrests 
of students before May 1. How could he 
make such a statement, unless he had been 
cooperating with the Narcs since they first 
began infiltrating the C-MU campus in 
October 1973?
When the trigger-happy Narcs come this 
time, will they get carried away and kill a 
student for resisting arrest? Is that what it 
will take to teach the Administration that 
they are courting with disaster by giving 
the Narcs free run of the campus? Why, 
Ron Taylor and Chuck Williams, do you 
insist on rewarding students who are pay
ing $5,000 a year to attend CarnegieMellon with a trip to jail and a criminal 
conviction that will follow them for the 
rest of their lives, when many college 
communities across the country have al
ready eliminated all criminal penalties for 
marijuana? The students of CarnegieMellon deserve an answer.

Many of you will recall that shortly 
after Dr. Cyert became president, one of 
the fraternities on campus was raided by 
law enforcement officers who believed that 
it was a source of drug traffic in the area. 
He responded promptly at that time by 
placing the fraternity on probation severely 
restricting its privileges, and he announced 
to the campus community that he would 
not participate in any attempt to shield 
people from the consequences of their 
actions when they were in violation of the 
r law. We believe this University must not 
ever knowingly protect people who misuse 
the academic community in clear violation 
of the laws of the state and nation.
This spring as a culmination of an in
vestigation then carried on by the newly 
formed Allegheny Regional Narcotic Task 
Force, a group of students were arrested on 
the morning of February 22. Six of them 
were charged with having in their posses
sion large enough quantities of dangerous 
drugs to justify the belief that they had 
been engaged in the selling of those drugs. 
Some of them apparently believed that the 
University would intercede for them and 
prevent them from suffering any con
sequences for such activity.
Such broad indication that illegal activ
ity involving dangerous drugs might be 
continuing on the campus led the President 
to invite the General Counsel for the 
Reponal Task Force to meet with him, 
Professor David Craig, and other officers of
the administration to assess the problem 
and to seek ways to prevent continued 
activity of this kind which is potentially 
destructive to students, but furthermore 
brings to the campus other associated 
criminal activities and has led to assault on 
students, theft of student and campus 
property, and a serious decrease in the 
safety and the integrity of the academic 
community.
The University is not a sanctuary and it 
is the right and responsibility of the 
Regional Narcotics Task Force to identify 
and prosecute violators so that this kind of 
activity inimical to the purposes of an edu
cational institution can be cleaned out.
Through that meeting, Dean Williams 
became aware of the probability of con
tinued enforcement activity by the Task 
Force and alerted students in SDC and 
UFO to the risks. He in no way has re
quested enforcement activity nor is he a 
party to it.
The University as a responsible member 
of the Pittsburgh community must co
operate with any agency that has a legiti
mate concern with the affairs of the Uni
versity. President Cyert met with senior 
members of the Task Force to search for 
ways to remove the need for raids in the 
future.
Chief Taylor and the officers of Campus 
Security are in no way working with the 
Narcotic Task Force. The University has 
asked however that Security officers be 
notified at the time a Task Force raid 
occurs and be allowed to accompany Task 
Force members during their presence on 
the campus for the purpose of minimizing 
the chance of violence or damage to per

CMU SEXISM
Editor:
As a new organization formed, in part, to 
confront sexism on this campus, we would 
like to comment on three recent incidents.
The first and most subtle, was the 
article on discrimination in Athletics in last 
weeks TARTAN. Mr. Haynes was correct 
that women have not been prohibited from 
trying out for mens varsity teams, but he 
did not add that the womens budget isnt 
even 10% of the mens, that women varsity 
members dont even get CMU P.E. Depart
ment T-shirts, not to mention $40 jackets 
and letters, that the men have eleven staff 
and the women have one, that the men 
dominate the big gym, while the women 
have had the use of it (though not on a 
regularly assigned basis) for the first time 
this year, that women athletes must sub
sidize their banquet while the men have a 
catered one on campus, and so on ad 
infinitum. Yes, there is discrimination in 
the Athletics Department at CMU. It is 
time for the President and mens Athletic 
Department not simply to recognize, but 
to encourage and financially support 
womens athletics.
The second and third cases relate to 
Spring Carnival advertising. Two women 
designed sexist posters - one for the picnic, 
and the other for the cover of the schedule. 
Why? Because it was what the public 
demanded. In the case of the PicnicPoster, 
the woman was commissioned to design a 
poster. She automatically produced the 
perfect, most saleable design possible, a 
nude woman. The other case was more 
continued on peg* g
dB lc! tpc,hr
Four more years! has become Four 
More seats! Its easy to see how to turn 
years into seats. First, you drop y from 
years and add s and add t. Voila! 
Four more seats!
Or you can just elect Richard Nixon to 
a second term and accomplish the same 
thing.
Today, just 17 months after Four 
more years! was the G.O.P. battle cry, 
the GOP is crying and Four, more seats! 
is the Democratic battle cry. Depsite a per
sonal campaign appearance by the titular 
head of the G.O.P., alias Richard Nixon, 
Republican James Sparling suffered a 
crushing defeat to Democrat J. Bob Traxler 
in the race for Michigans 8th District Con
gressional seat, considered a sure G.O.P. 
seat because 60 percent of the voters are 
registered Republican.
With nearly all the vote counted, Trax
ler had pulled nearly 54 percent of the vote 
in a district that has been sending Repub
licans to Congress for over 42 years.
Although it aint summer yet and the 
nightmare of television re-runs is not yet 
upon us, Republican National Chairman, 
George Bush, must feel like that nightmare 
is very much upon him. First, the party 
lost a central Pennsylvania seat, Republican 
for more than 25 years; second, it lost a 
Western Michigan seat, Republican for 
more than 30 years (and vacated by none 
other than Mr. Vice President Gerald 
Ford); then, it lost an Ohio district in 
suburban Cincinnati, Republican for more 
than 30 years. One pleasant repeat for the 
G.O.P. came in California where the party 
retained one whole seat (in 1972, the G.O.
P. candidate won going away with nearly 
67% of the vote, but just 17 months later 
the G.O.P. candidate eeked out a 53% 
vote). But now, Michigans 8th District and 
another Republican seat gone Democratic.
The central issue in the 8th District 
campaign, and the only issue, was Richard 
Milhaus Nixon. The Democrat, Traxler, 
stated that this election would be a Nixon 
referendum to send Washington a message. 
Since Republican Sparling felt the only one 
who could speak for Nixon was Nixon, he 
invited R.M.N. to visit the 8th district, 
much to the chagrin of the Michigan Re
publican State Committee.
Veni! Vidi! Vioops! Nixon came. 
Nixon saw. And Nixon was conquered. 
Nixon campaigned for Sparling only in 
rural, die-hard conservative areas-Nixon 
Country, where 65% of the voters went 
for Nixon-Agnew just 17 months ago. 
Nixon avoided the cities like Saginaw 
where unions are (but arent union men 
supposed to be a part of Nixon's emerging 
Republican majority?) and where un
employment is running rampant.
Nixons visit generated much interest in 
the election: so much that all the shunned 
city-folk turned out in droves on election 
day and Traxler won of the Nixon-shunned 
areas with such a plurality that Sparling 
was doomed despite a high turnout in 
visited or privileged areas.
Sparling was running 157 behind his 
G.O.P. predecessor even ui the rural areas, 
with a plurality but not enough votes to 
overcome the city people.
Ominously,Nixon*s first stop in Michi
gan was the town of Bad Axe. It certainly 
looks bad for Nixon nowso bad, in fact, 
that the axe might just fall...

THE TARTAN-Tuesday, April 23, 1974-Page 5
WRCT: Limited FM
Getting Down to BusinessWomen
dB lro KcomdsnE
In 1970-71 President Stever appointed a 
commission on the Status and Needs of 
Women at Camegie-Mellon University. 
After a lengthy study, a final report was 
drafted by this committee in the fall of 
1971. One of its major recommendations 
was the initiation of a gynecological ser
vices program.
During the summer of 1972 President 
Cyert, in response to a meeting with a 
committee of interested women, expressed 
a willingness to undertake an experiment in 
the delivery of gynecological services. This 
led to the Gynecological Referral Service 
Program of 1972-73. The program was 
successful, but limited, and it led to the 
recommendation of a more extensive pro
gram, which became a reality in the Pro
gram on Human Sexuality.
The Gynecological Services Committee, 
which included Dean Swank of Student 
Affirs; Ruth Beech, Director of the Affirm
ative Action Office; Sue Christian, Assist
ant Director of Student Activities; 
Margaret Frederking, graduate student in 
SUPA; and Marty Lisberger, the chair
person for the committee, spent the 
summer and spring of 1973 setting up the 
program. The program held during the past 
school year included: the gynecological ser
vices at the Student Health Center with Dr. 
Koehler and Mrs. Gibson; a counseling ser
vice for students who wish to discuss their 
sexual attitudes and behavior with pro
fessional counselors in the Counseling Cen
ter in Baker Hall; and other counseling in 
conjunction with the Peer Help Center and 
the campus chaplins. During the first 
semester the Human Sexuality Program 
sponsored an educational lecture series de
signed to deal descriptively with the 
physiology of sexuality as well as its nature 
and function. The program included a 
series of six lectures by professionals from 
the Pittsburgh area. It was highly successful 
and well attended by both men and women 
on campus.
The Dg 0Hfn c!rEs program, held in 
the spring of 1973, was another reflection 
of C-MU womens awareness of their 
particular problems as women and of their 
desire to raise the consciousness of the 
campus community. The program, initiated 
by Sue Christian, was designed by a group 
of women students. It included films by 
and about women, lectures concerning 
women in the professions and the psych
iatry of women, and workshops on sexual
ity, alternate life styles, and women in 
science, art and the humanities. Designed 
to create a dialogue between men and 
women, the Dg 0Hfn c!rEs program, es
pecially the workshop section, was highly 
successful.
Women on campus are now in the pro
cess of forming a structured organization 
for the women of C-MU through which 
women can strengthen their status and per
sonal identities as members of the univer
sity community. Begun as an outgrowth of 
the Human Sexuality Program, the 
4H!soSA wHppse3c,s started as an effort to 
discuss sexism in the classroom and in
dividual problems women students were 
encountering. The officers of the group are 
Marty Lisberger, Macy Mattox and Patty 
Resetar, with Susan Christian as the ad
visor. As Assistant Director of Student 
Activities, women students came to me 
with problems. Since I had the time, the
at CMU
interest, and the resources, I decided to 
initiate a group that could begin to deal 
with some of the issues that are of concern 
to women on campus, says Sue Christian.
The 4H!soiA wHppse3c,s9 which has a 
budget for 1974-75 approved by the Fi
nance Committee, is in the process of re
ceiving official recognition as an organiza
tion from Student Senate. The group will 
have a room in Skibo and plans to hold 
weekly meetings for interested students. 
The 4H!soSA wHppse3c,s will serve as a 
liason with Ruth Beech (Director of the 
Affirmative Action Office), supporting her 
in what she is doing for women on campus 
and making her aware of new problems and 
needs.
The groups plans for next year include 
participating in the Freshman Orientation 
Program, possibly introducing important 
women on campus who could be helpful to 
the freshman women, showing slides and 
films by and for women at orientation, 
having a display of women students work 
shown, introducing freshman to other 
women on campus, and serving refresh
ments.
Other activities planned for next year 
are: a seminar on self-defense given by B. 
H. Barry from the Drama Department; pro
moting media productions and dissemin
ating womens literature and information, 
and sponsoring lecturers who are relevant 
and sympathetic to the women at C-MU.
The 4H!soSA wHppse3c,s is an organiza
tion to which students can come with com
plaints and problems so that group action 
can be taken. The group has and will con
tinue to write letters to sexist advertisers 
and text-book writers.
Another womens group, started by Pat 
Matthews, is the RAAHecr3cHo Hy 4H!so 
tecso3cA3A rom uoEcossnAC These women felt 
that the University was not giving adequate 
representation to the particular problems 
they face as women in scientific fields. The 
group sponsors coffee with women scien
tists and engineers from the Pittsburgh area 
to discuss these problems and to give 
support to one another as women.
Women who are interested in becoming 
a part of these organizations, or have 
specific needs or questions, should see Sue 
Christian in the Activities Office or attend 
the weekly meetings of the 4H!soSA 
wHppse3c,sC Sue Christian remarked, I see a 
definite need for women to get together 
and deal with issues that concern them on 
campus. I feel the need myself as a 
woman.

WRCT resumed FM broadcasting just in 
time for the opening of Spring Carnival last 
Thursday, after receiving a revised con
struction permit and verbal authorization 
for transmission testing.
Since carnival, the station has been 
having technical difficulties with their 
transmitter. The nature of this problem 
necessitates limited programming since an 
advanced FCC license is required to make 
the necessary adjustments to the 
transmitter. Because only three staff 
members hold such licenses and demands 
on their time are large the station is not 
able to program fully. WRCT hopes to have 
the transmitter fixed by this week.
The change came as a result ot a tele
gram that WRCT General Manager Frank 
Napoli received at 9:15 on Thursday morn
ing. A new construction permit had been 
issued from Washington, D C. Transmission 
test authorization came from the district 
field office in Buffalo.
Asked whether the permission to return 
to FM came as a surprise, Frank said, It 
wasnt exactly a surprise out of nowhere. 
Ted Ruscitti, a professional radio engineer, 
used to work for WRCT and now works for 
WDVE. He called the Federal Communica
tions Commission and explained that we 
were waiting for our construction permit. 
He also tried to tell them that this is our 
biggest weekend at C-MU.
WRCT would continue broadcasting 
music for Spring Carnival even if installing 
the AM wires was an impossibility. Ex
penses for the total cost of the WRCT 
truck and wires is $300.00 which is en
tirely paid for the by Spring Carnival 
Committee.
The station had dropped its FM opera
tion only a few days after it began, when it 
was found that small changes in station 
equipment and personnel required the 
tiling of new forms with the FCC.

Security DepositsThe Great Rip-Off
dB wrnHpcos .c3easpp
For those of us who rent apartments, 
May is often the cruellest month finan
cially. Suddenly you realize that the two or 
three hundred dollars deposited with the 
landlord as security against the nameless 
threat of tenant-produced damages will 
never again rest in your bank account. 
Your landlord, by some hithertounspecified and probably spacious logic, 
has determined in his wisdom that the 
amount of your security deposit is exactly 
the amount of the destruction you have 
wreaked upon his premises. The $360 per 
month professor and the $60 a month 
student alike find themselves, to coin a 
phrase, ripped off.
Is this common practice? Yes. Is this
legal? No. Is this just? No. Are there honest
landlords who do not enrich their checking accounts by wrongfully wiiholding'security
money from their vacating tenants? Are
there honest politicians?
The widespread occurrence of wrong
fully withheld security deposits motivated 
the passage in 1968 of not a good law, but 
a great law: the Landlord Tenant Act, as 
amended. In addition to the immense per
sonal satisfaction of collecting every penny 
from your dubiously ethical landlord, the 
law gives you, under certain circumstances, 
double your money back, plus interest, 
costs and fees.
In order to qualify under the law, you 
must have done certain things: pay up all 
your rent according to the terms of your 
lease, give your landlord proper notice of 
your intent to leave the premises, and no
tify him in writing of your new address 
within 30 days of the time you leave his 
premises. If he doesnt know where youve 
moved, how can he mail you your money?
Your letter notifying him of your new 
address may contain a gentle reminder of 
the amount of security due you, if you 
think him reasonable.
Your letter must reach him within the 
h day period to set the stage for any 
double-damages suit later. Practical ex
perience shows that the letters most often 
lost by the U.S. post office are the ones 
notifying landlord where to forward security 
deposits. To avoid this claim that he never 
received your letter, you can pay your 
friendly neighborhood post office for 
registered mail, return receipt requested. 
For an additional few cents, you can get 
show where & to whom delivered or 
deliver to addressee only, which gets 
around the problem of his saying his wife 
never gave it to him or his dog chewed it 
up. You can also deliver the letter yourself, 
in person, to his office or home and make 
up your own creative receipt for it, which 
of course you have him sign in the presence 
of a witness like your girlfriend. This is 
more fun and less expensive than the $.95

or so you pay to have the post office do 
the eutire thing officially.
Now that you have posted or hand 
delivered your letter in compliance with 
the law (as they say), settle yourself down 
for a wait. Preoccupy yourself with other 
things, for it is doubtful that you will re
ceive your money with any great speed.
Under the relevant section, the landlord 
must do either of two things within 30 
days of your having vacated his premises:
a) refund your security deposit in full, or
b) refund part of the deposit and give you 
a written list of damages to justify his 
retaining the balance. In either case, he 
must take action within thirty days of your 
termination of the lease or your departure 
from his premises, whichever occurs first.
A landlord who fails to comply with the 
above is penalized by the law as follows: he 
forfeits 1) all rights to withhold any 
portion of your deposit; 2) all rights to 
bring suit against you for alleged damages 
to the premises. In addition, he is liable for 
double the amount he wrongfully withheld 
from you.
Fine, you may say, but whats to pre
vent my landlord from claiming some 
hysterical damage figure which, by the 
way, exactly equals my deposit? Well, 
regardless of what he claims, under the last 
section of the law above, unless hes gotten 
that list to you within the 30-day period he 
owes you every penny of the original de
posit. And if he has sent you a list within 
the 30-day time, you nevertheless have the 
chance now to critically review it in terms 
of whether the damage he claims you did 
actually existed, whether it was done by 
you, and if it was, whether the price he set 
as compensation for himself is a fair price. 
The law requires that the landlord be the 
one to prove both that the damages were 
done by the tenant and that the price he 
set was a fair and reasonable one.
Lets assume that the amount of 
damages is in dispute. Your landlord claims 
$100 of your deposit to fix a kitchen table 
you know was creaky when you moved 
into the place. Of course, normal wear and 
tear-the cost of repainting every three 
years, of replacing wornout screens or 
ragged carpeting-cannot ever be assessed 
against a tenant as damages. So well pre
sume that what the two of you are fighting 
about is not something like that. He 
probably claims some affirmative act 
was done by you to his property to qualify 
as damage: breaking a window, spilling 
paint on the floor, knocking out a wall, 
ruining furniture. You claim that nothings
wrong with it. If this is the case, 1!a w

THE TARTAN-Tuesday, April 23, 1974-Page 7
Entropy: Takes A Vacation Student Values: Crisis?
dB nsEHnB cpe2soor
Last fall, Dean Swank expressed con
cern to the Chaplains Committee about a 
significant and disturbing change in stu
dent attitudes. He was referring to his 
observation that more and more of the 
students facing the CMU Student Disciplin
ary Committee felt that their offenses were 
not morally wrong, offenses such as steal
ing from the bookstore, cheating on exams, 
and others.
A special committee was formed to in
vestigate this problem which has since be
come known as The Values Crisis Com
mittee at CMU. This group is composed 
of members of the CMU Campus Ministry 
Council, with the exception of Sue Christ
ian who is Asst. Director of Student Activi
ties. Rabbi Philip Sigal and Father Philip 
Walsh were assigned to begin a moralethical inquiry of the CMU Community. 
q Paul Balas volunteered to head the infor
mation gathering end of things and with 
Ken Neeley, of the University and City 
Ministries, and Sue Christian, devised a 
plan of action.
On December 3, January 21 and 28 
special sharing sessions were held at Tech 
House for the purpose of gaining informa
tion about social values at CMU. Eighteen 
to twenty-four members of the CMU 
community, representing faculty, students, 
staff, and administration, participated in 
these sessions. Each larger group was 
divided into smaller groups of 5 to 6 
people. A chaplain sat in on each of these 
groups to act as facilitator and recorder.
The committee has decided to use 
Harold D. Lasswells A kn!3t!x r$ aC! 
krltRy ARt!cR!E as a basis for evaluating the 
information gathered at these meetings. 
The Policy Sciences approach was 
selected because it takes seriously the 
valuing aspect of human social interaction 
and is academically sound and can be 
adapted to deal with either a wide or 
narrow variety of situations, according to 
members of the Committee.
The information gathered in these 
sharing sessions along with a Policy 
Science evaluation of the situation, was 
put in a 16 page report titled: mwnc!1t!0 
e!llrcH A wlf!E AafBy The report, 
compiled by J. Paul Balas, Sue Christian, 
and Ken Neeley, was presented to Dean 
Swank on March 6. It gives an account of 
how those involved in the sharing sessions 
view CMlTs value crisis. It attempts to 
define the much used phrase value crisis, 
and the nature of the problem at CMU. 
. . . to speak of a value problem at CMU is 
to speak of a situation in which persons or 
groups within the university are perceiving 
themselves as being deprived of their 
valued outcomes (what they want at CMU) 
8y other persons or groups. It may not be 
the easiest definition to understand but it 
is, at least, a *tart.
In addition to summarizing statements 
made in the sharing sessions, the report 
also presents several of the conclusions that 
can be drawn from the information ob
tained and offers several suggestions that 
could help alleviate the values problem. 
The report concludes that there is indeed a 
problem but that it includes but goes be
yond matters dealing with individual in
fringements upon person and property.
The chaplains investigation, though 
originally intended only to assess students 
values at CMU, has become an investigation
photo by Ed Levine 
J. Balas, Sue Christian, and Ken Neely, authors 
of a study of student values.
of the relationship between the university 
and the community at CMU. Nearly every 
comment reported in the report is negative. 
Complaints range from criticisms that the 
administration is dishonest and twists 
facts to flat statements such as big 
wheels count more than students and their 
$5,000 a year. More than one student 
restated what those before the disciplinary 
board have said:One is forced into dis
honesty in order to survive (scholasti
cally).
The recommendations presented in the 
report are essentially vague. J. Paul Balas 
hopes to see a greater chance for students 
to involve themselves actively in decisions 
at CMU. Given the chance, he said, Im 
sure the student body would respond.
Ultimately, Dean Swank will decide 
how this report will be interpreted. He 
feels that the research done so far by the 
chaplains has lost the focus he originally 
had hoped for. When asked if the report 
answers his questions about the value cri
sis' he said: Not at present, but I expect 
to have the information I want from the 
chaplains soon. He had scheduled a 
general meeting with them later in the 
week.
Dean Swank feels that the problems un
covered in the Chaplains report are not 
unique to CMU but are reflections of a 
cultural problem. We have no national 
system of values, he explained. Students 
have been brought up in an environment of 
self-gratification. Theres been a decreasing 
consciousness of social values.
The offering of a new course on value 
systems could be the solution to these 
problems, according to Dean Swank. If I 
received a suggestion for such a course, he 
said, I would back it strongly.
The report concludes with the point 
that . . for many persons the atmosphere 
at CMU is presently tainted with a sense of 
suspicion, anger and mistrust. J. Paul 
Balas initial suggestion is that new chan
nels of communications for students and 
faculty be opened.

Entropy, the campus store, will not be 
open during summer vacation. Tom 
Janicki, Manager and Barb Lindell, 
Assistant Manager, based their decision to 
close on the low volume of sales during 
Spring Vacation. Tom reported, On a 
normal day during the school year Entropy 
makes approximately 290.00-300.00 
dollars a day.
During Spring Break, we made an aver
age of seventy dollars a day. Of that 
seventy, fifty dollars were attributed to 
Grad students and students who could not 
go home; twenty dollars were attributed to 
the staff of the University. With this 
volume of sales Entropy could not cover 
costs of labor and would not be worth 
keeping open. He evaluated further that it 
was probably an overestimate of sales 
for in nice weather people are more likely 
to walk to Oakland or go downtown to 
buy articles.
Although Entropy will close for the 
summer, the store will open in the fall and 
resume services to the University 
community. Barb Lindell will become the 
manager. Changes for next year include 
expansion of the food line. We were going 
to expand selection of food this year but it 
was too late in the year. Milk sales are 
going well; we sell out usually at the right 
time.
Harry Rowell, Director of Operations, 
commented that Entropy has done a great 
job. Concerning the close for the summer, 
Rowell commented, I would have been 
willing to run a trial period during the 
summer. He stated that such a trial period 
would give a better sampling of what 
sales volume would be during the summer.
Rowell stresses the importance of good 
management and smooth operation for the 
future success of Entropy. Apathy in the 
student workers was cited as a possible 
future cause of failure.

complex. The woman designed an excellent 
cover tor the schedule, but it was rejected 
because it was too professional. So she 
gave the chairperson precisely what he 
wanted. The result two sexist designs. 
What this means is that women designers, 
whos business is to sell to the public, are 
being forced to produce products counter 
to their personal beliefs.
The purpose of our organization is to 
support all women on campus; helping 
them raise their own consciousness, and 
changing the attitudes of the male and 
female members of the CMU community. 
We hope all interested and concerned 
women will contact us by coming to our 
meetings in the M.G. library, Thursdays at 
5:30, or by contacting Sue Christian, Skibo

Editor:
At some random point within the last 
week or so, the administration has come 
out with a policy regarding the posting of 
non-official material. I do not know the 
exact wording of this edict; its direct effect 
seems to be that any decorative, humorous, 
or informative material posted on office 
doors must be removed. Since information
al material is doing no harm (f have never 
seen anyone injured by it; it violates no 
known safety code) I fail to see the point 
of this edict, except as an exercise in 
unilateral power.
However, what annoys me about this 
edict is the implications:
1) What is non-official material, or 
whatever the permissible phrase is? Appar
ently this decision is left to the janitorial 
staff.
2) When the administration complains 
that budget shortages have required serious 
cutbacks in the amount of service provided 
as far as cleaning (and related services) and 
the chalk trays in some of the classrooms 
and offices of Science Hall seem not to 
have been cleaned in months, how can 
anyone justify one man spending nearly 20 
minutes scraping a 3 inch by 4 inch (my 
estimate) sticker off the door of Warner 
Hall? How much did that cost us (just in 
dollars, based on his salary, fringe benefits, 
accounting overhead, etc.)?
3) If such material is not to be posted 
on walls, doors, etc., then it is up to some
one to provide adequate bulletin board 
space to post it (the fact that it is posted at 
all implies someone wants/needs to post 
it!). Existing wall and door space is essentiall free, it is paid for. How much will it 
cost (materials and people cost, not to 
mention the fact that the people involved 
could do better things (we hope) with their 
time) to install a completely redundant set 
of surfacts to post non-official material? 
(Is a bulletin board any different than the 
wall behind it?)
In any case it appears to be a significant 
waste of our tuition money (and/or other 
funds) to attempt to discourage people 
putting up notices. Considering the fact 
that the University has been wailing about 
lack of funds this seems a rather bizarre 
way of reducing expenses and increasing 
service.
(You will note that I have said or im
plied very little about such abstracts as 
freedom of speech, the rights of a person 
to decorate his/her office door, or suchlike.
I actually am concerned with such issues, 
and the right of any administrator to 
unilaterally decide to infringe upon certain 
freedoms. But these are abstracts, easily
arguable, often indefensible. Therefore I 
felt S should phrase this letter in terms 
easily understood by most people: money. 
Shall we have one part of the administra
tion striving to conserve it while another 
thinks up new ways to waste it? The cur
rent policy seems dedicated to wasting 
money while antagonizing a large number 
of people; an even worse combination!)

I received a memo stating that Dean 
Swank has asked Mr. Van Horn to re
direct some custodial time to the cleaning 
of posters from walls and windows and 
doors. 1 interpret this as meaning tlrat 
custodians will come along, rip all the post
ers down, and throw them all away.
Posters were recently put up publicizing 
the Third Rites of Spring Boogie, a 
dance to be produced by myself this Fri
day. Each poster cost SI.00. (This is the 
average for any Activities Board poster ot 
this size.) If there was any room on any of 
these nice new bulletin boards, or any in
dication that people would see anything on 
these boards, 1 would have placed my post
ers on them. But there is not. For the time 
being, I will continue to put my posters 
where 1 feel they will be seen and read.
For the record, I feel that there is 
neither enough board space nor enough 
litter containers to contain all the adminis
tration-decreed litter.

I am responding to a letter that 
appeared in the April 9, 1974 edition of 
the TARTAN, a letter directed at this cam
puss ROTC, yes, the hideous, 
arrogant, egotistical ROTC. Those 
who shoot down harmless, defenseless 
civilians.
You see, very often, I myself look out 
the window three or four times before 
leaving the building. Searching for those 
fear generating uniforms, those insignias 
of the murderers. I always make double 
takes at cars and trees, fearing that one of 
those despicable characters is behind it, 
just waiting for me. It is likely that thepe is 
a storage room of bullets in the basement 
of Margaret Morrison - one bullet for each 
of us, one with our name on it.
This has to be the situation, for whnt 
other purpose could the ROTC have, but 
to place snipers in strategic positions to 
pick off us civilians one or more at a time. 
This is one reason why I avoid Hunt 
Library at all costs, because (if all will 
please note) of the obviously man made 
fox hole dug out around a tree there  (to 
the right hand side of the doors, toward 
fine arts). This foxhole is a very strategic 
position and offers the Hitler Youth (I 
mean the ROTC cadet) a very strategic 
position. Think of the effectiveness of a 
machine gun mounted and manned at such 
a location. After all, military science IS 
the theory of effective murder". By the 
way, I didnt realize that these cadets were 
required to take German, for surely the 
Hitler Youth were not required to take 
English, or were they?
I agree with Adler that the philosophy 
of murder should be banished from every 
level and discipline of this university.
However 1 would not stop there, what 
about the rest of the country?
This, then, is my suggestion: that the 
congress of the U.S. pass a law to outlaw 
the philosophy of murder and put to 
death those who break this law, i.e. death 
by a firing squad. Perhaps this could be 
carried out on some island.
Yes, now I know what those loud 
banging noises that 1 sometimes hear on 
campus are; they are probably our trained 
murderers making a hit, or using students 
for handgrenade practice, or perhaps they 
are mining Forbes Avenue or even placing 
anti-personnel mines on the cut, for 
nothing is below those that would willfully 
and maliciously take anothers life.
And, comrade Adler has stated that he 
found war unpleasant. But isnt this 
attitude a touch too soft. Because as every
one knows, war is Hell!!! He has also said 
that the government and people of the 
United States agreed with him when he 
says that he and they do not want to 
play in their murderous game, i.e. the 
ROTCs games. So ROTC and these 
scientists and philosophers stand alone and 
should be crushed without any (I mean 
more) forethought.
What an ideal position and what a dis
tinguished honor it is to be sure a prece
dent setter as to be the 1st superpower to 
go totally offenseless and defenseless. 
Think of all the money that would be 
saved.
This, then, is my second suggestion, that 
the money saved on the ROTC scholarships 
be used to institute a phone system in this 
country, that, in the case of war, would 
play a pre-recorded message in Russian 
and Chinese. The message: WE
SURRENDER.

In response to a letter opposing ROTC on 
this campus I must disagree. I do not like 
ROTC, the armed forces or war, but I can 
not force these morals upon others. I do 
not wish to die in a war but if another 
wishes to die (and maybe save my life) let 
him do so.
If we are to banish ROTC because it is 
morally objectionable to some people, then 
perhaps we should abolish the English De
partment because the courses given there 
are, in some instances, morally objection
able to me. 1 also question the validity of 
calling ROTC theory of murder. From 
what Ive seen, it is more of a science of 
survival and defense. I only ask how many 
of us could survive in the USA without all 
the shelter and support of our technology; 
or how many of us could fight or die.

In response to Susan N. Klein's recent 
critique of the movie vas nsr3 r3AdB I 
have to ask if she really viewed the movie 
or just sat in the theatre talking with some
one or biting her fingernails, every now and 
then looking up at the screen - missing the 
whole gist of the story.
Sue condemns the movie for not 
achieving its purpose (whatever that pur
pose is in Sue's mind) and father being 
filled with frivolous gestures. If she read 
the book or paid attention to the movie 
she would realize that that was exactly one 
of the purposes F. Scott Fitzgerald was 
attempting to achieve in his great book.
I don't always agree with what Sue 
Klein writes, but that's the differences r$ 
opinion. However, her latest critique was 
very poor. It came across as if Sue did cra
know what she was talking about.
To say the scene where Nick, Gatsby, 
and Tom are waiting outside the Buchanan 
home is nothing more than a fashion show 
or a self-pride show for Robert Redford is 
to wipe out completely the surface plot of 
the story. He acted his part very well 
regardless of whether Sue Klein likes the 
actor or not.
I suggest Ms. Susan N. Klein go back to 
see vas nsr3 r3AdB and this time watch 
the movie.

The faculty egg toss, organized by 
Tanya Allmond, was renamed the egg toss. 
Despite only one faculty members pre
sence, the event was held with under
graduates competing for distance. Dave 
Fink and Ron Neale won first place after 
tossing an egg 150 feet. An egg was heard 
to comment during the toss, These things 
always break me up.
Mens relays gave the carnival a unique 
sense of competition. The Alchemy I team 
and Captain Greg Polasky took first, 
second, and third place in races as they 
were the only team who showed up.
There was a good wind for the kite 
flying event where participants just en
joyed watching their kites take to the 
breeze. A free picnic on the intramural 
field contributed to a pleasant afternoon 
for those who attended.
Photos for this Spring Carnival feature 
were taken by TAUT AN staff photogra
phers Elliot Arons, Ellen Eddy, Chris 
Forland, Elliot Popowitz, John Rose, John 
Shettel, and Brian Smith.

Spring Carnival brought some officiality 
to the art of frisbee throwing.
The Friday afternoon event began with 
a frisbee football contest. Frisbee football 
is a team sport, each team being composed 
of approximately seven players. The object 
is to throw a frisbee from person to person 
and move the frisbee over the goal line. If 
the frisbee touches the ground or is inter
cepted, the frisbee is turned over to the 
other team. This contest lasted about 
twenty minutes. Each member of the win
ning team received a frisbee. A total of six 
teams competed.
In addition there was a distance frisbee 
toss. Any person throwing a frisbee over a 
certain pre-determined distance in one of 
three tries won a frisbee. A total of diFc 
dozen frisbees were given out.

BOOTH IS:
Thinking up an idea that will appeal to 
young and old alike.
Finding the right materials for the right 
prices.
Making compromises as the time grows 
shorter.
Finding out you have three papers due jnd 
two finals the week after spring carnival. 
Trading electrical power for manpower. 
Pulling an all-nighter the day before mid
way opens.
Not doing any work until after the week
end.
Freezing out in Skibo parking lot on mid
way watch at four in the morning with 
nothing to watch.
Eating your lunch with paper-mache hands. 
Running down to Oakland six times for 
three things.
Praying for the right weather.
Not changing your clothes for three days 
because you don't want to get any others 
dirty.
Going insane if you're a perfectionist. 
Wondering if everything will be ready in time. 
Spilling paint all over an hour before mid
way opens.
Little things going wrong that you don't
have time to fix. - ( > - 4*r
Crossing your fingers as the judges come 
around.
Looking at your booth through other's
eyes.
Plastering a smile on your face and losing 
your voice.
Learning not to eat cotton candy while on 
booth watch because the tennis balls stick 
to your fingers.
Getting all your friends to lose their 
money.
Trading cracker jack for goldfish .
Taking off time to look around at all the 
other great booths and trying to figure out 
how they work.
Hoping you make enough to cover the cost 
of materials.
Hoping your English professor doesnt 
walk by and ask why you haven't been to 
class in two weeks.
A lot of work, but a lot of fun.
Hating to tear it down when Carnival is
over.

Carnival 74 provided a colorful display 
of artistic talent and ingenuity as evident in 
the booths on the Midway. After passing 
under the blinking logotype, the spirit of 
spring and carnie life invaded the visitor. 
Booths ranged from impressive towers to 
painted boxes, games reflected clever 
minds and sleepless nights.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon combined the 
most interesting use of space, artistic tal
ent, and originality in a game with Fan
tasia. Although SAE was partially plagued 
with operation, hopefully you saw it while 
contestants perched on mushrooms racing 
to fill flowers with water from dancing 
broomsticks. The Greatest Show On 
Earth by Kappa Alpha Theta also did a 
fine job in integrating theme and game 
with a roaring lion gulping sand bags. A 
painted clown added a touch of a circus to 
the Midway.
Kappa Kappa Gamma illustrated a bit of 
college life with College Daze. The mural 
in the background was adeptly painted to 
give atmosphere to the throwing game. 
Goldfish were awarded to anyone who 
could make the paper man swallow a gold
fish.
Alpha Tau Omega showed resourceful
ness in their eerie-sounding booth called 
Frankenstein. The winner of the game 
received a grim stare from a rising monster. 
Although it was a grim subject, the 
mechanics were impressive. In contrast, 
Delta Delta Delta exhibited a simple and 
refreshing Pinocchio. The game was ring 
toss and pinocchios nose provided an ideal 
target.
Delta Tau Deltas game was engulfed in 
a foreboding geodesic dome. Game and 
booth were incorporated in a well-devised 
plan: losers would woefully bring a swing
ing blade down and decapitate an innocent 
paper body.
Follow the yellow brick road and win a 
goldfish as Delta Gamjm;j presents a cok)^ 
fill rendition of The Wi/ard o] O/. The 
simplicity of the game was compensated by 
the brightness of attending girls and
brilliant colors. (Did you see the five 
streakers in the background of the booth?)
The effects of Beta Theta Pi (Poseidon 
Adventure), Tau Delta Phi (Thunderball), and Theta Xi (Forbidden Planet) 
seemed to be lost in the complexities of 
each booth, although exceptional effort 
was definitely there.
A miniature golf game by Delta Upsilon 
was pleasant but somehow not related to 
their theme of Fiddler on the Roof. The 
booths of Sigma Nu (The Great Train 
Ride) and Chi Omega (Casablanca) 
appeared forlorn in their ill-devised use of 
space. Both booths lacked the exciting 
quality of ingenuity.
. The addicted gambler had an adequate 
opportunity to throw around some money 
on the Midway. Kappa Sigma (2001: A 
Space Odyssey), Pi Kappa Alpha (Bon
nie and Clyde), and Phi Kappa Theta 
(Casino Royale) featured uninspired 
gamWing games. Pi Lambda Phi exhibited a 
flashing speedway that was difficult for a 
carnival crowd to participate in or apprec
iate.
Of the non-fratemal organizations, Stu
dent Dorm Council (Andromeda Strain) 
displayed a mechanical booth and game 
that looked risky. Spirit seemed to lack 
some spirit for Spring Carnival, if their 
booth was an indicator.
Bob Culbertson, the 1974 Chairman of 
Midway, commented that he was satisfied 
with the booths this year but wished 
somi of them were more complicated. He 
added that this years theme lended itself 
to versatility for there were a great num
ber of movies to pick from. Midway seems 
to be an annual financial success and Bob 
predicted that it would break even. He 
explained that this was probably due to the 
great weather which brought a lot of 
people to the carnival.
Bob's only suggestion for change con
cerned security: There were little hassles. 
There was, however, a hassle getting secur
ity. This was because no-one wanted to 
take the job. Next year I would keep secur
ity but use fraternity and sorority people as 
much as possible in security positions.

THE TARTAN-Tuesday, April 23, 1974-Page 13
Crafts Display Novelty
by Sharon Curcio
The Arts and Crafts Festival opened at 
Spring Carnival with an array of pottery
 and ceramics, herb and decorative plants, 
lithographic prints, sculpted items, candleIware, leathercrafts, wall hangings and even 
some prize finger paintings from the tod
dler at the Carnegie Mellon Day Care Cen
ter. Students, alumni and invited artisans 
pf died their wares under a strong April 
sun.
Perhaps the most unusual exhibit was a 
jewelry display made from old silver 
spoons Wendy Zolnar, a Pittsburgh 
$ craftswoman invited to display her items at 
the Carnival, said it had taken her quite a 
while to gather enough old silverware to 
make the rings, bracelets, and super
imposed delicate porcelain cameos upon 
flattened ladles.
As for leather goodC an anthropology 
student from the University of Pittsburgh 
had attended a school on the West Coast to0 learn how to work with leathers. Sam 
Trapani had learned a great deal there; his 
display of embossed hair fasteners and 
visors, belts and a ten gallon hat indicate 
careful work.
Clothing items for sale included a blue 
denim and other patchwork skirts in dis
play by Judy Stenger from Pittsburgh. Ms. 
Lynn Martin displayed her handmade 
g shawls, berets, crocheted vests, and purses 
made from jute. Knitted items from hand
made booties to puppets were among the 
eye-catching novelties. Barbara Flexer in
formed me while she treadled her spinning 
wheel that she had only been spinning for a 
year after having found the 400 year old 
wheel in Vermont last year. The wheel was 
originally Irish, but was taken to Canada in 
 1720. Before finding the spinning wheel, 
she had used a drop spindle, a more primi
tive way of producing natural fiber threads 
than the spinning wheel for producing 
threads or yarn for knitting, weaving or 
crocheting. Although Mrs. Flexer occasion
ally sells her thread, she often uses this raw 
material herself to make delicate scarves, 
lyirs. Flexer buys the sheep shearings in 
the grease and spins them that way because unwashed wool spun produces a 
naturally waterproof fiber.
Macram plant holders are decorative 
ropes that suspend ceramic planters from a 
wall or ceiling. Rhonda Hartman, their
creator, mentioned that the macrame hold
ers are made from jute, a fiber excellent for 
outdoor hanging. She laughingly explained 
that boy scouts and sailors learn to make 
macrame knots and that all you have to 
do is creatively apply them.
Two painting and sculpture students, 
senior Andrea Arch and Sister Mary Edith 
Nemeth, displayed their artwork. Andrea 
said her silk screen prints in pastel shades 
had already appeared in the Student Art 
Gallery. Sister Edith Nemeth, a printmaker major in the College of Fine Arts, 
will receive her B.F.A. in two weeks after 
nine years of undergraduate part-time 
study. Sister Edith has been working with 
wood cuts for the past three years and her 
motifs are a combination of Japanese de
signs and her own touches. Although 
woodprints are traditionally black and 
white, she has recently begun to experi
ment with color. Well, Sister's experiment
ation can only be described as successful. 
Her use of lime, rust, and black in a nature 
motif set with leaves, birds, and huge sun
flowers makes for an unusual contrast. 
Another lithographic printmaker is Arlene 
Meyer, a 1958 graduate from the College 
of Fine Arts; her black and white studies 
portrayed a prisoner grasping a dollar-sign 
prison bar while another showed a whim
sical mermaid squatting on a rock.
Painting and Sculpture major Jeff 
Susman displayed a collection of function
al ceramic pieces like bowls or thick 
pottery plant holders which have a raised 
thick-walled vase, set in a sculpted base. 
P&S student Patty Dyke made rather tall 
ceramic vases, resembling a tower made of 
blue-grey layers; while Dan DuBaras con
tributed blown glass sculptures, shaped like 
spheres.
Lesa Platt and her partner Mitchell 
Blocker recently opened up a jewelry store 
in Shadyside called Genesis where Lesa 
sells the jewelry she began making last 
year. Lesa specializes in beaded wire 
craft and uses an African bead motif to 
make the beaded rows resembling an in
verted, dangling pyramid.
Marsha Rueter, a craftswoman invited 
to the arts and crafts fair, music major 
Mike Marx and Psych major Paula Gross 
exhibited pieces of oddly shaped stained 
glass wrapped (or molded in) lead. Mike 
said that the stained glass is first cut into
Some of the pottery on display at the festival.

gong is placed around the margin of the 
glass. Ms. Reuters display contained fun 
forms like ice cream cones, elephants, and 
rabbits. Paula and Mikes exhibit featured 
stained glass and variegated, rippled and 
opalescent glass.
Lisa Nicholas, an art major who grad
uated from Chatham a few years ago, 
Barbara Ford, a M.F.A. in crafts from 
C-MU, and B. B. Goldberg, contributed 
some lively ideas in the form of ceramic 
plant holders, decorative ware, and even a 
tea set to the fair.
Herb and rare flower exhibits added the 
touch of -botanical art to the crafts fair 
with Anita Grannemann selling the fruits 
of her organic gardening interest. Success 
doesnt matter, said Anita. 1 love doing 
this. Exotic plants were displayed by 
Everett Sturgeon, a semi- professional gar
den designer, who says that he has always 
had a passion for horticulture. His exotic 
and tropical exhibit included raconium, 
cicineco, rapsalis, euphobia. and vauxonaus.
Novelties were plentiful items like sand
stones tinted with industrial glaze and de
signed in Easter egg fashion sporting smile 
faces. There were also smile prints and 
smile rocks available. Imported from India 
were ornamental wall hangings, embossed 
sandals, and gilded jewelry boxes. David 
DiZinno, a local carpenter, displayed low 
relief wood sculpture in a variety of ab
stract works as well as a map of Pittsburgh 
and one of Italy.
From the Omnibus shop were clay discs 
with leaf impressions, which resembled 
fossils with fern impressions. In addition, 
the shop brought Austrian chevrons, beads 
once used in the slave trades, African 
amber, Israeli glass beads. Mexican onyx, 
and Italian milifiori beads which he said 
were 400 years old. The oddest beads, 
however, were sea urchin spines, with 
stone-like texture and a vertebrae shape.

able as the first exhibit on the Skibo side
walk belonged to Jim Ulrich, an art student 
from the University of Pittsburgh who 
graduated last year. Jim prefers ceramics 
now' to print making, and plans to create 
more ceramic pieces in the form of wall 
hangings.
P&S fiber sculptor Jody Bikoff ex
plained that she used a loom to make her 
wall hangings. Jody had separated the 
threads on the warp, after some amount of 
weaving, into groups and had used knotting 
and tying techniques to give the fiber a 
unique texture. She then tied brass plates 
to the long strands. Jody used for material 
old nylon stockings, raw wool, and velvet.
The Arts and Crafts Festival provided 
artists with the opportunity to inspire the 
public with a conglomeration of unique 
mediums.

Election Results in Ties
continued from page 1
Groupe said lie thought that the booth 
on Carnival Midway did attract voters 
Tht: number of ballots cast on Midway was 
not available, but about 30% of the total 
vote was cast on Thursday afternoon.
Several contests will have to be decided 
by Senate or the Election Appeals Board.
In the UFO constituency, Robert 
Ammerman and Janice Cay wood tied for 
the last available seat. (In Senatorial 
elections, a constituencys seats are given 
out one by one to the candidates polling 
the highest number of votes.) But ten of 
Caywoods votes might be disqualified be
cause they came from students outside 
UFO who wrote in her name.
In the Independent constituency,
Joseph R. Finnegan and Paula Strasser are 
tied for a single available seat.
In the Commuter constituency, seven 
write-in candidates are tied for three re
maining seats.
Films Up 25
Students will be paying an additional 
twenty-five cents next year for Activities 
Board films. *
Lorraine Weisbrot, chairperson of the 
AB film committee, attributes the price in
crease to the rising expense of purchasing 
films. We really could have used an extra 
five hundred dollars from Finance Com
mittee," she said.
The charge for next years films will be 
seventy-five cents with an Activities Board 
Card and one dollar without a card.
The opening movie next fall will be 
Clockwork Orange. Those films definitely 
scheduled are A Touch of Class, Day of the 
Jackal, and Fritz the Cat. Cabaret will play 
for homecoming. There will also be a Sher
lock Holmes Festival and a Marx Brothers 
Festival.

Student Film Festival
bv Mark Evan Oiimsky
Theres New York and Cannes and 
Venice, but theres no place like home for 
a film festival of new cinematic art. On 
April 12 and 13, C-MU's Activiffcs Board 
and Department of Student Activities 
sponsored its fifth annual assortment of 
student-made movies. The premiere crowd 
was truly festive, and the evening quickly 
became a close, informal party of people 
viewing and responding to the work ot 
their peers.
But the critical process must alter to fit 
the level of accomplishment of the filmcreators. Many of the efforts presented 
were initial attempts, and must be viewed 
like any piece of beginning art' judged 
more for its inherent creative potential 
than its immediate, finished form. The re
sults were, for the most part, encouraging; 
and though lack of originality and selfindulgence (the two major traits of any 
novice artiste) were in full blossom, 
there were enough fresh buds to give 
promise to the evening. In fact, through
out, it was the little touches, (a neatly 
arranged shot herea wonderful camera 
trick there) that were most impressive. It 
is the details of a first work that are most 
important, for usually the whole is too 
loose and unsustained. I tried to catalogue 
all the small moments where everything 
jelled and true film art was realized- but 
unfortunately. Porter Hall gets very dark, 
what with doors closed and the air thick 
with smoke. Still, many dashes of creativ
ity were impressive enough to linger in my 
memory. 1 was fascinated by the show's 
brief launch into painted animation by 
Stan Edelstein. Threads of color mingled to 
the musics pace; simple and easy bait for 
interpretative inclinations. Its length was 
an excellent lesson in the effectiveness of 
brevity.
Gauge, a film by Scott Kenworthy. Barb 
Freeman, Kathi Sabot, and Mark Bonin, 
featured brilliant use of fast-motion and 
jerky camera movements to make the 
mundane chilling. An aged Pittsburgh Press 
vendor, hawking his papers, stared hollow
ly into the camera. The shot resembled.
with eerie intent, the Nazi documentaries 
of World War II. The grainy film tone 
well-matched the vendors hopeless crack 
of a smile.
Amy Hororwitz supplied a lighter touch 
with her 1 Vi minute animated short. The 
Danccr. We watched as the limbs of a 
spindly, pen-and-inked ballerina slowly 
eased and glided across the screen, her arms 
becoming elongated, hysterical corkscrews. 
She then twirls full-circle in mid-air. This 
ephemeral slice of film macic turns into a 
clever and surprising spoof oi the acro
batics ot dance.
Next we plunged i^to the valley of 
comic shlock with In The Mood by Linda 
Ackerman and Kukla Harris. One of the 
few, true plot-action films, the story cen
tered on some mafioso types lending a 
little life (and death) to a rather draggy 
barroom dance. The tongue-in-cheek per
formances were amusing enough to com
pensate for the films slight choppiness, 
especially Mark Lione as the Son of God
father. and Matt Neiburger, looking 
suspiciously like the Son of the Bride of 
Frankenstein. The lilting Scott Joplin rags 
were also put to good use.
With her untitled film> Kathleen Butler 
caught the close whirl and sloppiness of a 
Science Hall Bathroom Party. Her film 
credits, printed on a roll of paper toweling, 
were inspired.
Jim Wheeler's detailing of a suicide was 
brooding and beautiful, and passed un
appreciated by the eager-to-laugh assembly. 
Working well with the contrast of shadows, 
light and dark, and pacing his film to a 
deliberate rhythm, Mr. Wheeler has a much 
welcome knowledge and insight into the 
film art.
The first half of the evening ended on a 
Woody Allenesque note. Jim Huttner and 
Robert Whitter conceived a wild satire on 
scientific experimentation. Sparked with a 
collegiate, borderline insane humor. The 
Effect of Gamma Radiation on Man-inthe-Moon Marigolds was pleasant and 
entertaining Huff. I particularly enjoyed 
the teletyped credits.
The animated shorts claimed victory 
over the human drama in the festivals
second half. The Visitor by Brady Lewis 
was an exciting, nerly professional pro
duction. His running girl and butterfly 
were set against a flashy background of 
ever-changing colors.
There was a discreetly bourgeoisie 
charm about An Afternoon at a Hotel by 
John Hornick. The whimsical illustrations 
achieved a lightness well-suited to this tale 
of a bassist and a grande dame, who refuses 
to stay in Hotel Room Number 13. Stevie 
Wonders accompaniment, the song 
Supersticin" was most appropos.
Shopping Center by Joe Drexler, a liveaction film about a sleazy store and its 
clientele, communicated a firm, powerful 
sense of atmosphere and the bleak resigna
tion of many working class shoppers.
Of all the shots, one gentle, graceful 
image remains my favorite. Scott Ken
worthy deserves credit for producing a 
moment of true magnificence in his 
Summers Almost Gone. It is one of those 
little acts-a young girl awaking lazily, her 
hands unfolding in slow motion to the be
ginning strains of Scheherazade by 
Rimski-Korsakov. All movement and sound 
coalesced to form a delicately balanced 
cinematic event.
In general, the films were thoughtful 
and somewhat lacking in inventiveness. 
There were occasional lapses into Walt 
Disney-type nature shots and rich displays 
by film-makers all too obviously in love 
with their own technical prowess. Also, the 
emphasis of many films appeared to be on 
execution rather than content. We received 
a heavy dose of execution in Michael 
Marks and Stephen Smalls Psycho Cowito, 
the festivals token offensive film, con
cerning the bloody, ritualistic ravishment 
of a cow by a couple of masked funseekers. Im tempted to label it sensation
alist gore, but others, whose opinion I re
spect, have praised its honesty and vivid
ness. Still, there was a heaviness about the 
organic rites.
But gore or no gore, hopefully these 
film-makers will strive to polish and perfect 
their style. After all, who knows where the 
next Truffaut, Bergman, or Bogdanovich 
will come from?
Wonder what ever happened to those good
old days? Well, theyre being melodiously 
evoked by the combined talents of the 
CMU Jazz Ensemble and Beaver Area

THE TARTAN-Tuesday, April 23, 1974-Page 17
by Rob Simbeck
I have no idea how Ill spend my time if 
I happen to make it to heaven, but theres 
one thing Im sure of. Every night when I 
get ready for bed, Maria Muldaur is going 
to call me on 'he phone and sing lullabies 
to me. Really. Every time 1 hear Midnight
P at the Oasis, I feel like I did in high school 
the first time my girlfriends parents went 
away for the weekend. Its got a warm, 
intimate, sensual splendor thats as wel
come in a sing aswell, as an oasis.
Muldaur has been around since the early 
60s, when she was part of the Even Dozen 
Jug Band (along with a fellow named John 
Sebastian). She was with the Jim Kweskin 
Jug Band for a few years, and she made
* three albums after the demise of that 
group, two of those with her husband 
Geoff Muldaur.
This, her first solo album, is faultable 
for two things, both of which occur fre
quently in debut albums, and both of 
which are more than made up for by Ms. 
Muldaurs voice. The first is that she 
touches too many bases. Theres a good
* dose of country, a touch of Motown and 
jazz, the Feel My Leg/Oasis sensuality 
numbers, and, for good measure, a song 
called Mad, Mad Me that could fit easily 
onto any Joni Mitchell album. Variety like 
that takes away from one of Marias best 
attributes-the ability to establish a believ
able and totally absorbing mood. Just 
when she has you wanting to spend a few
1 years at the oasis, she comes back with
some country numbers that, though well 
done and rewarding in themselves, dont 
allow for an album that flows. You have to 
pick your songs according to the mood 
youre in.
The other flaw is simply that the ma
terial is not consistently strong. Three Dol
lar Bill is a prive example of that. But 
again, thats almost always the case with a
debut album of new material, and it isnt 
that painfu,l here.
Muldaur adapts herself beautifully to 
every musical style. The C&W is especially 
gratifying. Maria does not have a voice that 
would especially endear her to the Grand 
Ole Opry crowd, but listen to her
down-home twangy voice on My Tennessee 
Mountain Home and see if you cant pic
ture her sitting barefoot on the porch 
watching the kids chase fireflies. In this 
song, as in all the others, she is simply 
marvelous.
There is one other song I want to men
tion Dont You Feel My Leg. In this beau
tifully playful bask in sensuality, Maria 
comes up with the kind of performance 
that I consider classic Muldaur, the kind Ill 
remember and appreciate the most. She 
oozes in and out of phrases in a way only a 
truly superb artist can.
In the places where it takes more than a 
great vocal performance to make a satisfy
ing song, Muldaur gets all the support she 
needs, and more. Whereas Joplin often had 
to compensate for her bands and session 
musicians to produce a good cut, Muldaur 
can always count on her musicians to pro
vide an inspired backdrop which she can 
use as a starting point for her own bril
liance. Listen to Doctor Johns piano work 
on Feel My Leg, where he skitters madly 
over the keyboard, tapping out triplets 
near the end like the worlds most 
avant-garde Morse Code sender. Amazing. 
The Doc and such notables as Richard 
Greene (once violinist with Kweskin, Seatrain), Klaus Voorman, Jim Keltner, Jim 
Gordon, and Ry Cooder are all earning 
their session pay.
The production, with the exception of 
some worthless strings on Oasis, is also 
fine. All in all, an album well worth what 
you pay. Maria Muldaur will provide you 
with all the pleasure you could want in an 
album.
Now you can 
against muggers, rapists 
and worse with this 
amazing new whistle. Wear it
as a necklace or carry it as a key chain. Its long-range 
penetrating shrill brings help in a hurry. The next dark 
night (that's tonight!) you'll feel a lot safer just knowing 
you have the greiitest protection in the world. Gives 
obscene phone callers a shrilling earful, too.

NAME
Scotch and Soda
by Brendan Gill
Hurray for the first act of Scotch and 
Sodas Of the Valley; it illustrates, with 
simple elegance, what intelligence can do 
for a show. The dialogue is crackling and 
full of puns (most of which youll miss), 
and although the vignettes are too long and 
scenes need cutting, the originalities of 
character and situation are to be applauded 
loudly.
Of the Valley is a show about multiples. 
Paul Szauter plays a double-talking judge, 
speeding through his speeches which are 
purposely packed with mumbo-jumbodouble-dealing. Stereo is a character, com
posed of Barry Lipsitz and Brad Kaspari, 
who philosophizes in stereo, speaking and 
moving with eye- popping precision. Lila is 
the main character, whose moods are per
sonified and re-embodied five times, with 
five new characters, throughout the course 
of the show.
The premise of Of the Valley is some
what flat, but its bedecked with dialogue 
that brims with bite and shows knowledge 
of the power of language. Though the story 
itself grows weak, the words maintain a 
level of interest and create an intelligent 
auro of their own. Jane Abrams and 
Christina Haatainen, one of whom we un
derstand to be a playwrighting major, have 
worked and worked on their book for Of 
the Valley. Unlike many variety shows, and 
even some professional shows, theyve 
given their book a dynamic, underlying 
rhythm; it is a great, separate facet of the 
show rather than a messy, boring way of 
getting from song to song.
Marty Goetz wrote the music and lyrics 
for Of the Valley with cute and simple 
tunery. He also plays a character named 
Piano Man, and sings a beautiful song
I he
Hairpainters1 ,M' 1 <lv Wavers*

Complete Hair

For Men & Women
called I Am My Song. The number goes 
right along with the preceding set by Tina 
and Jane; its a series of musical puns 
which admirably add up to an intelligent 
and purposeful moral. Goetzs professional 
abilities are a welcome pluswe want him 
to sing more than one solo.
The direction of the show was divided 
between its three creators and there is a 
handicap. Had there been one skilled di
rector, I doubt the show would have had 
such mistakes as useless props, (this could 
have been a bare-stage show throughout), 
or a finale where the chorus leaves in the 
middle of the song, for no purpose whatso
ever, only to return again; 01 three main 
characters who remain enfenced in a pit 
onstage after their sequences are over. Yet, 
in the long run, these problems are minor. 
There is a happy feeling of bopping-upand-down movement in the show, and 
though this js perhaps useless, dancey 
froth, its nevertheless unpretentious.
The show falls down during the Second 
Act, and although its thankfully short, the 
addition of some new characters the caliber 
of State or Stereo would have helped, as 
would a re-mixing of the book with two of 
the five Lila characters saved for the 
Second Act.
When the curtain comes up, nothing 
really happens except a lot of gospel-handclapping for the next fifteen minutes. The 
set by Tina was beautiful, and finally made 
proper use of the vast ballroom cavern; 
Tom Youngs lighting was a colorful treat. 
Of the five Lilas, my favorites were Susan 
Zipf as a dancing Lila, and Marianne 
Shaffer as a dumb Southern broad. Con
gratulations to all on a successful show, 
arid kudos to Abrams and Haatainen for 
opening up their thesaurus and diction
ary!

student, Ted Kaehler, lost a photograph, 
several re-prints of articles, and some news

way the administration handled this was 
very wrong. Janitors appeared in the

Eli Grba. Marv Throneberry. Pumpsie 
Green. Rod Kanehl. This isnt a list of the 
astronauts who walked on the moon or 
even a few former Vice-Presidents. No, 
these men are much more important, de
serving a special niche in the memory. 
They have all had their pictures on baseball 
cards, thus leaving a legacy to history (and 
also collecting a fee, which now amounts 
to S250). None of these men is in immed
iate danger of being elected to the Hall of 
Fame, but to a baseball card aficionado 
Marv Throneberrys card is the equal of 
Henry Aarons.
What person doesnt have memories of 
collecting baseball cards? In the spring a 
young boys thoughts dont turn to love 
but to baseball. And when the first baseball 
cards arrive at the local store, it is a har
binger of spring, much like the first sight
ing of a robin. Pop bottles are returned and 
their deposits used to buy baseball cards. 
Your mother tells you buying baseball 
cards is a waste of money, but shes only a 
girl so what does she know about baseball, 
anyway?
Collecting cards was a rite of spring, a 
reminder that school was almost over, and 
that the Pirates would be playing soon. The 
Pirates cards always seemed to be the 
hardest to get. But when you opened a 
pack of cards and got a Don Hoak or a
Akadama Mama says,
Be Nice to Mice.
This weeks letters 
were kind of 
dull, but I did get 
a neat package.
It contained a home 
built mouse trap. Not
of ice and lemon and orange slices. 
To make more just double, triple or 
quadruple everything.
Listen to Mama, 
and pass the Akadama.

Vernon Law you forgot about the 3 or 4 
Don Elston oj Bubba Phillips cards you 
had. You wouldnt even care if the gum 
was stale.
Baseball cards served many purposes. 
Many kids got their first taste of the free 
enterprise system trading cards. You could 
flip them, pitch them, or have games using 
them as players. The cards were also valu
able storehouses of information, having all 
the players statistics on the flip side. 
(There was always a kid, probably headed 
for electrical engineering, who could quote 
every fact from the back of the cards.)
A book by Brendan Boyd and Fred 
Harris, The Great American Baseball Card 
Flipping, Trading and Bubblegum Book, is 
a loving chronicle of the innocent days of 
youth which anyone who ever collected 
baseball cards will enjoy. Although their 
collecting prime was in the fifties, and 
mine was the early sixties, there really isnt 
much difference. The players may change, 
Hank Aarons home run total surpass 714 
but collectors are always the same.
Baseball card collecting is a big business. 
At a convention and auction held in New 
York City, a Honus Wagner card from the 
early 1900s sold for SI,500. In those days 
cards were printed by many different 
companies.
Today the undisputed king of the hill is 
the Topps Company of Brooklyn. They 
print cards for football, basketball and 
hockey, but baseball is the backbone of the 
company. In early February Topps photo
graphers go from team to team, taking 
pictures of the boHplaycis. And since $250 
is a lot of money for a few minutes posing, 
nobody declines the offer. In fact, you 
know youve made it as a ballplayer when 
your first baseball card picture is taken.
A1 Ferrara, a journeyman outfielder for 
a few National League teams, was once 
asked why he became a ballplayer. He re
plied, I always wanted 0 be on a bubble
gum card. Collecting baseball cards is a 
vicarious way of being a major leaguer. Of 
course, only a few kids make it as far as 
Ferrara did, and he fully understood the 
curious business he was in. Its a combina
tion of make believe and reality a return 
to youth. And someday A1 Ferrara will not 
only have his memories, but also his base
ball card to remind him, and us, of when 
we both were young. ~
