Evening School Discontinued
Dean of the College of Fine Arts, Norman L. Rice.
CFA Seeks Next Dean
A committee comprised of all 
department heads of the College of 
Fine Arts has been working since 
last winter in an attempt to find a 
replacement for Fine Arts Dean 
Norman L. Rice. Dean Rice will 
retire when his replacement has 
been named.
The Committee which had been 
working informally before the 
spring of 1971 is now comprised of 
the following department heads of 
the College of Fine Arts: Chairman 
Earl Gister (Drama), Delbert High
lands (Architecture), Bruce Bre
land (Painting and Sculpture), 
Joseph Ballay (Design), Sidney 
Harth (Music).
The committee began its search 
for a new dean by compiling an 
informal list of possible candidates 
which included between 50 and 
100 names. This original list was 
generated by personal contacts of 
the committee members and 
suggestions from faculty members. 
The Search Committee, as it has 
named itself, then proceeded over 
the summer months to narrow the 
list to its present number of less 
than 10 candidates.
Many of the names listed origi
nally were simply not available or 
were not interested in accepting 
the position. Campus visits and 
broader interviews have now be
gun with the remaining candidates. 
These interviews include question 
and answer sessions with student
and faculty representatives to the 
CFA College Council as well as 
with members of the Search Com
mittee and other interested indivi
duals.
Dean Rice assumed his present 
position as administrator of pro
grams in music, architecture, 
drama, painting, design and sculp
ture in 1954. He had served as 
director of the School of Art at 
Syracuse University from 1943 un
til 1953. In 1953 Dean Rice was 
serving as chairman of a Commit
tee of Consultants for CarnegieMellon University (then Carneige 
Institute of Technology). The pur
pose of the committee was to eval
uate the College of Fine Arts in 
terms of its effectiveness as a cen
ter of learning in the fine arts. Pro
fessor Rices performance on this 
committee was impressive, as in 
February, 1954 he was asked by 
the Universitys President John C. 
Warner to become dean of the Col
lege of Fine Arts.
The Search Committee hopes 
to find a new dean for Fine Arts 
before July 1,1972. It reports sub
stantial progress and is hopeful 
that the present list of candidates 
will yield a replacement. Further 
information about the candidates 
to be interviewed may be obtained 
from representatives to the Fine 
Arts College Council. ?

The TARTAN has just learned 
that evening school currculums 
leading to a diploma will be discon
tinued in June of 1973. The an
nouncement was made over a year 
ago.
The main reason for the phasing 
out of the night curriculum pro
gram was the declining part-time 
enrollment in the evening school.
Only several years ago there 
were well over a thousand parttime evening school students. Now 
there are approximately 400 and 
probably no more than 125 of
these students are working on de
grees stemming from the designed 
curriculum.
The decline in evening school 
students is directly related to the 
University of Pittsburgh School of 
General Studies offering evening 
courses that are considerably less 
expensive than the courses here. 
At Pitt courses are $ 12 a unit while 
here they are $26 a unit.
Kenneth Burchard, director of 
eveing and summer sessions, noted 
that while evening students pay 
the same cost per unit as day stu
dents, they do no benefit from any 
of the facilities on campus.
What does the closing of 
evening school mean for the aver
age full time day school student? 
Nothing. Essentially it means that 
day school will be extended from 
4:30 to 10:30PM and that evening 
school, as a seperate school, will be 
phased out. All matters and pro
blems related to earning a degree 
will become a departmental mat
ter, and no longer a joint problem 
between the evening school and 
the department. ?
"Nothing But A Big Rubber Stamp"
With the resignation of several 
senators this week, Student Gov
ernment President Vince Misitano 
called the Student Senate no
thing but a big rubber stamp, and 
suggested that in the future 
monthly Senate meetings would 
be sufficient.
Presently, Senate meetings are 
held weekly.
The senators who resigned felt 
that the Senate had lost impor
tance, especially in the eyes of the
students. Misitano told the Senate, 
(we) should define exactly what 
Senate should be doing and grasp 
its relevance or lack of relevance.
After a lengthy debate, during 
which the suggestion was made 
that the individual committees be 
given the power to allot funds and 
recognize organizations, and that 
the meetings of the Senate as a 
body be discontinued indefinately, all ideas were tabled until next
Tuesdays meeting.
In other business, the Senate 
allocated money to the Fencing 
Club, the Peer Help Center, the 
Karate Club, and Scotch n Soda. 
Along with the Ski Club, it recog
nized the CMU chapter of the 
Chinese Club (which for some rea
son evoked giggles from the 
senators).
After a short debate, Senate de
cided that a request to keep the 
gym open late Sunday nights be 
tabled to the General Campus 
Committee. ? Renee Banks
Students Allocated Computer Time
In planning the allocation ol 
computational resources for the 
campus community for the acad
emic year 1971-72, the Director of 
the Computation Center reserved a 
portion of the resources to be 
available for use by individual 
students independent of the com
putational resources available in 
connection with assigned courses 
or research.
The purpose of the allocation is 
to recognize the extent to which 
computational facilities have be
come a resource to each student in
a major University and need to be 
available in much the same way 
that University libraries are avail
able. Therefore, each student will 
be given access to the WATFIV 
and PL/C systems for use in the 
exploration process which is part 
of all independent education. 
Documentation on these systems 
is available at the CMU Bookstore. 
Usage numbers are posted in the 
Computation Center. The student 
number is the password. For pur
poses of testing this allocation of 
computing resources, each student 
enrolled has been allocated $1.00
per month of computing re
sources. On this allocation the 
average student can run from 
20-30 jobs per month. Average 
jobs contain approximately 100 
statements and print approximate
ly ten pages.
The allocation per student is 
not cumulative and is not trans
ferable.
Mr. Harry Rowell, Associate 
Director of the Computation Cen
ter, or Dean Swank, Dean of the 
Division of Student Affairs, will be 
happy to receive comments on 
ways to improve the success of this 
experiment as students begin to 
use it. ?
Induction Notice
If your lottery number exceeds 
125, your chances of avoiding in
duction this year are good.
With the issuing of Memor
andum No. 55 from Washington 
recently, all local boards were in
structed to not pfocess any lottery 
numbers above 140. If your num
ber is above 140, consider yourself 
safe.
Those with numbers from 125 
through 140 might possibly be 
processed i.e. made to report for a 
physical and answer a current in
formation questionnaire;but these 
people are unlikely to be inducted.
The TARTAN last week re
ported that draft calls would not 
exceed lottery number 153.
With the passage of the most 
recent Draft Law, the current 
freshman class and all succeeding it 
have lost their student deferment. 
Only as members of a campus 
ROTC department can new stu
dents receive an equivalent of the 
old 2-S deferment.?

Editor's Note
What then is the essential differ
ence between what is called the 
real world and our particular es
tate, the academic world9 Simply 
this. The real world is character
ized by mindless bodies; the acadeihic world, by bodiless minds.
Although bodiless minds are 
not nearly so contemptable as 
mindless bodies, they are still 
somewhat disturbing. They dont 
DO anything. They just talk  
and criticize. Like flies, they flock 
to and feast upon what somebody 
else has done.
Now you may feel that bodiless 
minds serve a valuable purpose; 
that they are uninvolved and ob
jective, and as such serve as the 
real worlds conscience, advisor, 
inspiration, and judge.
Forget it. The actual output of 
bodiless minds is, by and large, so 
much esoteric clutter, a reshuffling 
of cards for intellectual solitaire, a
soporific product of so many at
tempts to gain academic recog
nition. Nothing more.
Now dont get the impression 
that I regard bodiless minds as im
practical or irrelevant, for I find 
them without peer in a most prac
tical and relevant artthe bodiless 
mind REALLY knows how to 
bullshit.
Recently, a freshman girl told 
me of her admiration for the work 
of Fredrico Fellini. But after pur
suing the subject, I found she ac
tually possessed no knowledge of 
his work whatever and, in fact, 
that she had never watched any
thing much above the level of Matt 
Helm movies. She had been en
gaging in the common game of in
tellectual name dropping, but she 
had been woefully unprepared for 
it.
A neophyte in the wonderland 
of four-flushers, this girl had yet to
master the most rigorously taught, 
most valuable lesson in higher edu
cation today: the ability to sound 
as if you know what youre talking 
about, even when you dont.
Bullshit, no matter how outra
geous, takes on a certain Credi
bility when footnoted. And there 
are no bigger footnoters alive than 
the people of bodiless minds.
To elicit high quality writings 
on intriguing topics, the TARTAN 
is occasionally moved to offer 
money for copy.
This week, it is offering $ 10 for 
the most perceptive, thorough, 
and accurate interpretation of the 
statement, Who escalloped pota
toes by Ike Eisenhower.
Entries must be submitted to 
the TARTAN office no later than 
noon of October 11th.

Letters
Student Organizations
To the Editor:
In the Editors Note of Sep
tember 30, 1971 it was remarked 
by you that the days of student 
organizations at CMU are num
bered. This point may or may not 
be true but it is not my intention 
to take issue with that point in 
particular. It is what followed fur
ther on in the article that moves 
me to write this response.
You further stated in the above 
mentioned article that We dont 
need. . .SPIRIT or all the rest of 
our organizations either, with one 
exception at which point you 
elaborated on the need for the Ac
tivities Board.
I would like to ask you before 
the rest of the campus community 
what gives you the right to make a 
judgement upon the necessity, or 
lack of necessity, of having a Black 
Student organization on campus? 
Is it a pre-ordained right, ignor
ance or is it considered the best 
move for the entire campus com
munity? If it is one of the first two 
reasons I feel sorry for you at this 
late time in our mutual history. If 
it is the last reason, then you had 
better cop a squat (sit your 
behind down) and dig the fol
lowing. ..
You stated that This campus is 
not a community. . . With this I 
agree. At very best, and for want of 
a better description, this campus is 
made up of two major spectrums; 
that being, one Black and one 
White. Regardless of how you feel 
or wish to argue the point Im sure 
that you can think of .enough ex
amples on your own to make you 
concede that proposition. You 
also stated, during the mid
sixties, when college students out
grew the panty raid..., they also 
rejected involvement in traditional 
student organizations. Here again 
we must differ to a degree. Black
student organizations, such as 
SPIRIT, that evolved in the mid
sixties were by no means tradi
tional organizations!
The abolishment of student or
ganizations in general and SPIRIT 
in particular, as far as you are con
cerned, is based on two major 
ideas; 1) traditional organizations 
are losing members and 2) they no 
longer serve the campus at large. If 
this is true then neither reason is 
applicable to SPIRIT It is neither 
traditional nor aimed particularly 
at serving the majority of students 
on campus.
SPIRIT serves a minority that is 
not served by the majority! Until 
the majority starts to recognize 
that there is, unfortunate as it may 
seem to some, a minority group on 
campus SPIRIT and other B.S.U.s 
will continue to exist.
In essence Im saying that be
fore you say something that refers 
to the good of the whole 
campus please preface by adding 
for White Only.
Gary Scott 
Chairman of SPIRIT
Editor, the Tartan:
Id like to add my name to your 
rapidly growing list of admirers. 
Since I have one of the plushest 
seats on the gravy train, I feel its 
only proper that I pay tribute to 
you for giving this four year vaca
tion from life such a descriptive 
and highly accurate name.
All praise aside, though, Id like 
to comment on your last editorial 
about student organizations. While 
I agree fully with your analysis of 
the decreasing relevance of most 
campus groups, I must take excep
tion for a few cases. There is one 
type of group which I see as worth
while here, that being the group 
that keeps a lot of student busy 
doing something they like for a 
long time. The kind of organiza
tion that induces active creativitiy 
and participation is, in my opin
ion, the only relevant one. I would 
certainly consider myself in a ster
ile environment if my only option 
were to sit back and listen to AB 
concerts (fantabulous though they 
be.)
Therefore, let me enumerate 
some of the Good Guy Groups as I 
see them:
SPRING CARNIVAL keeps 
more students busy more hours 
per year than most curricula.
Orientation gets 150 upper
classmen together with 700-800 
freshmen for the only great CMU 
weekend some of them will ever 
experience.
WRCT(surprised?). Though no
body listens and they spend 
$9,000 per year, have you ever 
seen how hard those guys work?
The TARTAN. Youre one of 
the hardest working bunches on 
campus, and in the someday to be 
published SG survey, (I peeked) 
youll find that you score 4,000% 
with the Student Body.
900 little clubs: Chess, Astro
nomy, Karate, etc., ad infinitu, ad 
absurdum,ad nauseatum.
I contend that all of the above 
groups accomplish at least as much 
as AB concerts, ie, everyone who 
gets into them comes away a little 
happier.
But the rest of them, the Tech
nical (one editor and maybe a 
dog), the Yearbook (not even a 
dog this year), the Academic Af
fairs Board (the What?), Student 
Senate (42 popular egotists), all of 
these should be abolished. We 
dont have to worry, though, 
theyre dying fast enough on their 
own.
Vince Misitano 
President
Student Government
Insecurity
Dear Tartan:
In response to the Insecurity 
letter by name withheld:
The offensiveness, poor taste, 
and anonymity are beneath res
ponse. What concerns me more is 
the hypocrisy of demanding 
weapons to drive criminals off 
campus while rejecting city police 
because Drug use is an undeniable 
fact of life on this campus. Also 
of concern are the values of an 
individual who threatens armed 
violence in response to burglary.
I would also like to express ap
preciation to Ron Taylor for his 
efforts to increase Securitys ser
vice to the campus and his at
tempts to integrate Security more 
acceptably into the CMU com
munity. His experiments might 
well become a model for city po
lice across the nation.
Steve Jurman
Angela
To the Editor:
In regard to the article titled 
Angela in your September 16, 
1971 issue of the Tartan, I would 
like to clarify some of the state
ments.
On the first day of the Institute, 
the delegates divided into two 
groups, a White and Third World 
Constituency. The Third World 
constituency consisted of all Third 
World delegates.
In the meeting of the Third 
World group, chaired by Dr. Regin
ald Wilson of the University of De
troit, the Angela Davis resolution 
was formulated and presented to 
the main body at the Institute. Af
ter reconvening on August 18, 
1971, the resolution was adopted 
by this body. The student mem
bers of the Institute were asked to 
have this resolution published in 
their campus newspaper. However; 
the article in the Tartan in incom
plete. It should read, In the con
text of the National Student Coun
cil YWCA Institute on the Web of 
Racism and Higher 
Education ...
CMlfs YWCA was represented 
by sophomore Agatha Marshall, as 
well as myself.
In addition to the Angela Davis 
resolution, Third World people 
created a Third World Committee 
to insure proper consideration on 
other proposals presented to the 
National Board YWCA. This Third 
World Committee consists of one 
student and one Y-staff member of 
every ethnic group and alternates.
Alice Easley
Campus Sculpture
Dear Sir:
In the controversy about the 
scupture between Science Hall and 
Porter Hall, has anyone mentioned 
the artists name?
He is Jim Battisti, Our campus 
needs more work like his.
Sincerely yours,
Richard L. Schoenwald 
Professor of History
Dear Doug,
I thought that 1 should let you 
know that that thing* on the Hammerschlag Cut was brought forth 
from the fertile mind of Jim Bat
tisti, who is, indeed, a student here 
in the respected painting and 
sculpture department. Since Mr. 
Battisti has not exactly been 
throwing money around lately 
(frankly, hes rather poor) I as
sume that he has donated his work 
to our beloved alma mater as a 
token of his esteem, bravely and 
with great humility refusing all of
fers of monetary reward.

Student Corporation Forming
A student-managed and run, 
non-profit corporation is being 
formed in Pittsburgh. The purpose 
of the project is to give students 
experience in the actual manage
ment of a corporation and to de
velop entrepreneurial skills. In 
addition, the corporation can serve 
as a focal point of contact between 
students, business community and 
government.
Several businesses, including 
PPG and Kopper-Sinclair, and the 
Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce 
have pledged the initial funding 
and guidance. Furthermore, sever
al faculty members at CarnegieMellon have already indicated 
their willingness to include work
ing in the corporation as part of
laboratory/course work in which 
academic credit would be given.
An import-export venture was 
chosen because of its low initial 
capital requirements and easy 
start-up. The corporation is open 
to all students from all disciplines. 
A workshop meeting will be held 
on Thursday, October 14, 1971 at 
11:30 AM in Scaife Hall Auditor
ium. At this meeting the project 
will be discussed and ideas gener
ated. Interested faculty members 
and several people from the busi
ness community will be present, 
interested students are invited to 
attend the meeting. Questions on 
the project should be directed to 
K. S. Pribadi, Ext. 315, Mellon 
Institute. ?
... there is no career that can match business in diver
sity of intellectual interest ... A vigorous, free society 
calls for the highest type of business leadership ..
THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
invites you to meet with its Admissions Represen
tative, Mr. Tcrnj Mahuron, Assistant to the Director 
of Admissions on Friday, October 22, 1971, to dis
cuss th Stanford M.B.A. and Ph.D. Programs in 
Business Ad ministration.
Appointments to meet with Mahuron may he 
made through the Bureau of Placements.
The M.B.A. Program is a two-year general management 
course particularly designed for students who have 
majored in liberal arts, humanities, science, and engi
neering. The purpose of the Doctoral Program is to 
train scholars for the stimulating challenge open to 
business educators, researchers, and innovators
CMU Graduate Needs Money
Dick Hughes needs money, but 
not for himself. In 1968, Mr. 
Hughes went to Vietnam and 
began a home for the homeless 
children in the streets of Saigon. 
Three years later, he is still in Viet
nam. He is now running 4 of these 
homes in Danang and Saigon, 
housing a total of 130 of these 
wandering children, as they are 
known in Vietnam. He desperately 
needs money to keep these homes 
in operation.
Many of these children arrive in 
Vietnams two largest cities, the 
victims of war actions that have 
destroyed their home villages, or 
broken homes caused by the war. 
They live in the streets and must 
steal in order to survive. Some have 
been crippled by exploding land 
mines and by schrapnel, and have 
no way to obtain proper medical 
treatment. Dick Hughes attempts 
to provide these children with 
food, clothing, medical care, and a 
home where they can find disci
pline and love.
Mr. Hughes is a native of Pitts
burgh and a graduate of the drama
department at Carnegie-Mellon. 
For a time he was a member of the 
Boston Theater Company before 
going to Vietnam. He has spent the 
past three years raising the money 
to support his homes. The cost is 
$2,500 a month. He has received 
very limited support from Ameri
can companies and organizations. 
The Esso and Shell companies in 
Saigon have contributed about 
$100 each. Mr. Hughes major 
benefactor has been a Vietnam 
company whose manager has sup
plied the homes with money and 
repairs.
Dick Hughes has come to Amer
ica twice in order to raise funds, 
but the American public has been 
largely unresponsive to his pleas. 
The purpose of this article is to 
make a request for the much 
needed money to help Dick 
Hughes with his work. If you can 
spare the cost of a carton of cigar
ettes, send it to Dick Hughes, 
JUSPAO Mailroom/Saigon, APO 
San Francisco, California 96243. 
It would be warmly appreciated.

report on student evaluation of 
participation on trustee commit
tees. The Mens Dorm Council and 
the Womens Dorm Council have 
also requested an opportunity to 
discuss their thinking about parie
tal regulations.
Students who wish to suggest 
additional items for the agendas 
should get in touch with Vice Pres
ident Schatz (Educational Affairs 
Committee), Vice President 
Strathmeyer (Building and 
Grounds Committee), or Dean 
Swank (Student Affairs Com
mittee). ?
CMU Student Gallery
The CMU Students Gallery has 
begun its third year of operation. 
The gallery is located on the corner 
of Margaret Morrison St. and 
Forbes, and shows exclusively the 
work of CMU students.
Three years ago the space was 
occupied by the Woodlawn Phar
macy. When they moved out, 
several interested students con
vinced the school to support a gal
lery. The school then spent consi
derable sums of money to renovate 
the building; putting in good light
ing and new walls. As a result, the 
students of CMU now have a so
phisticated exhibit space in which 
to show and sell their artwork. All 
students are invited to submit 
work, regardless of their major.
In the past, the school supplied 
the gallerys operating budget be
cause the 20% commission that the 
gallery takes from sales has not yet 
been higji enough to cover ex
penses. However, this support was 
withdrawn last year, and after 
some difficulty, money was allo
cated by Student Government. 
The present directors, Pepper Pe
terson, Carol Claar, and Geoffry 
Fried, hope to use this year of 
grace to put the gallery on a firm 
foundation in both the school 
community and the larger Pitts
burgh community.
So far, student interest has been 
high. Upwards of twenty students 
have been donating their time to 
keep the gallery open regularly. 
Large group shows are prominent 
on this years schedule, as these 
seem to serve more artists than last 
years exclusive one man shows. 
With this in mind, the directors 
would like to build up a large 
stockpile of work. Artists can 
bring their work in anytime during 
regular gallery hours, even if it 
does not pertain to the show that is 
running or about to be run. The 
next two large shows will be 
graphics and a Christmas sale 
specially featuring photography 
and crafts. At present the gallery is 
showing glassblowing and fresh
man portfolio work through Octo
ber 13. The hours are Monday 
Friday 11 AM to 8 PM, Saturday 
and Sunday 11 AM to 6 PM. ?

CMU VERSUS ITSELF
Or, what is an artist, or even 
better, what is this universitys 
conception of what a fine arts 
student is? The Arts departments 
generally find themselves neg
lected here by the rest of the 
community: if they dont bother 
us, well leave them be and segre
gate the Fine Arts building from 
the academic campus. If they 
do make impressions, we ignore 
them. We receive a slight stir when 
a controversial metal sculpture 
appears on the cut.
Otherwise, we prefer to divorce 
the artist.
The TARTAN pays no atten
tion to the Fine Arts (except for an 
occasional building design) and I 
must necessarily share responsibil
ity for this neglect. If the depart
ments are doing something, the 
community should know. If the 
departments are stagnating, how
ever, we should examine the rea
sons for supporting an arts pro
gram. If it isnt worth it, drop it. 
But there are neither reports of 
progress nor of mediocrity. No one 
seems concerned with providing 
those reports, nor in gleaning in
formation. Possibly, the Arts de
partment wishes to divorce itself 
also. Who minds?
The Fine Arts building sits al
most in the center of the campus as 
far as accessibility. To most of us, 
it is a building to walk past. Some
times there are humanities stu
dents (and even less often, CIT stu
dents) who use the rehearsal 
rooms. Sometimes these students 
are asked what theyre doing in the
Fine Arts building when their 
major is in another department. 
Nobody expects non-arts students 
to have cultural interests or 
talents. Therefore, few of them ex
hibit those interests. This is a po
larity perpetrated by both arts and 
non-arts students. Segregation.
After the Dramatic Arts com
plex is completed, will any of this 
change? No. The feelings about 
this project seem to be that CMU is 
doing the Arts departments a favor 
with this undertaking. This com
plex had been planned, along with 
Skibo and Science Hall, over ten 
years ago. It is clear to see where 
the priorities lay. The Dramatic 
Arts Center will probably effec
tively serve to get the dramats out 
of the scientists belly, and into 
their own sub-campus. More 
segregation.
There can be no unification of 
the factors unless some of the fol
lowing images are dispelled. The 
CIT students version of the artist 
looks like this:
 If in painting and sculpture, the 
student wears jeans with paint 
spots, patches, and holes in seats 
worn thin. He frequents the Tartan 
grill and sits outside Skibo, laugh
ing at the scientists. He always car
ries his 18 x 20 sketch pad.
 If in drama, the student wears 
brightly colored clothing and talks 
with an Oxford accent. If a girl, she 
wears black leotards, occasionally 
without a bra. The dramat is ex
tremely outgoing, which some
times disturbs the introverted 
science major. Male drama majors
are homosexualfemale students 
will sleep with any other arts 
major. They all take drugs.
 If in music, the student spends 
all his time in the rehearsal rooms 
and isnt usually seen carrying his 
instrument. The music major looks 
down on rock as noise and 
Grand Funk Railroad as trash. 
Bach is beautiful, the Mothers of 
Invention are unusual, but too bad 
they fool around so much.
The myths arent all one sided. 
Fine Arts majors may look at their 
science-oriented peers in this 
manner:
 Every CIT and Mellon Institute 
student spends five hours a week in 
the keypunch room of the Compu
ter Center, and spends twice that 
writing programs to predict the 
probability of rain on successive 
Saturdays on campus.
 If the science student has a girl
friend or boyfriend, she or he is 
also a scientist, with hopes of be
coming a lab technician someday. 
The girl is plain. The boy hasnt 
begun to shave. Their idea of fun is 
yelling Focus! at the dorm 
movie.
 Engineers are only in it for the 
money. They wear shirts often, 
and visit their advisor when they 
have scheduling problems. They 
watch closely for Dow Chemical 
interview dates, and subscribe to 
Popular Science. They are on 
food contract.
 The math major was born with 
an I.Q. of 210. He can multiply 5 
digit numbers in his head. In se
venth grade he developed a mathe
matical relationship between the 
groups of the periodic table, only 
to have it stolen. Two months 
later, it was printed in Popular 
Science. The math student 
doesnt eat.
The H&SS students are caught 
somewhere in the middle. The sci
entists would prefer to relegate 
this problem of polarity to the so
ciologiststhe artists feel psychol
ogy and sociology to be too gener
alizing to include art in a probe 
such as this. The humanities also 
have an advantage here (in this res
pect, at least) in that they can fall 
both waysinto the arts, or to
ward the science. For the most 
part, H&SS departments are non
polar; i.e., the feeling toward those 
students here seems to be accep
tance from both sides of the aca
demic spectrum. Nice metaphor.
So, how is the situation reme
died? If left to itself, it will not 
improve, but further disintegrate. 
There will be arts majors on one 
side of campus and engineers and 
so forth huddled in Doherty Hall 
and the comp building. Separated.
One reason the two groups 
seem unable to integrate may be a 
lack of common interests. This 
necessarily points to course selec
tions as well. From the moment 
CIT students are accepted here, 
their four-year program is laid out 
like a set table. They are forced to 
eat the entire prepared meal. With 
a small choice of desserts outside 
their department. Taking an arts 
course in ones senior year is just
an after-dinner drink compared to 
what it could be for some if en
abled to take it earlier. There is just 
no course mixing between the de
partments, regardless of interests. 
The degree layout is just too con
fined for most CIT and MI stu
dents.
It is also doubtful that arts stu
dents would enjoy classes such as 
Polymeric Studies in Advanced 
Engineering or subjects it takes the 
science majors themselves a great 
amount of time to subdue.
Thusfirst, science majors 
should have a freer program of 
electives. Perhaps more of them 
could in this way exercise their 
interest in the arts and bring their 
thoughts at least closer to the area 
of the Fine Arts majors. They also 
might receive a fuller and more 
fulfilling education. (No cliche 
intended.)
And second, intro courses 
should be available in not a few 
science fields, based so that the 
arts or H&SS student will not be 
lost in a tangle of theory and math
ematical proofs. The same arrange
ment could also be made for CIT 
students as far as art and music 
courses are concerned.
Maybe then the dramat and the 
computer programmer wont have 
to pass each other on the cut and 
look at one another as if they were 
from different universities. Such 
bright hopes, son, but how can you 
make money in a field like that?

Its already that time of the se
mester when those first papers are 
due, and the crush resulting from 
trying to get them done leaves lit
tle time for the necessities of life 
^h as film going. So this week 
instead of letting all of you out 
there in reader land know what 
this writer thinks is worth spen
ding two and a half bucks on, he 
has decided to help you with one 
of the worst problems confronting 
the harried paper writer, namely 
how the hell do I start this thing
Below you will find a list of sure 
fire first lines guaranteed to start 
those creative juices flowing. After 
utilizing one of these and a few 
bottles of ale youll find that in no 
time youll have anywhere from 
four to ten pages of highly imagin
ative prose which youll be proud 
ta turn in to your composition 
course, creative writing class, 
drama course or any other place 
you can get away with it.
Freezing to death is more com
fortable than it would appear.
I can never remember if the 
poison mushrooms are the ones 
with the points, said Grandma as 
she served dinner.
After falling three and a half 
stories a human head hits the pave
ment with exactly the same sound 
as a cantalope which has fallen on
ly half that distance.
When he returned home from 
the war Mike discovered to his 
great surprise that his son had 
grown another foot.
Marvin wasnt even aware that 
he had the disease until his right 
ear fell off.
The faster you move, the 
quicker you will sink,explained 
Omoga, my native guide, with a 
sneer.
The Health Department in
spector was shocked when he dis
covered how Sam the Butcher got 
that old world flavor into his sau
sage.
I must admit that it is rather 
unnerving to open your drapes in 
the morning only to discover that a 
747 is headed straght for your bed
room.
I dont know what youd say, 
but Im really happy that that 
foul-mouthed twenty-five year old 
girl died.
Tomorrow Im quitting teach
ing to become a numbers writer.
Ill never forget what happened 
when Pete put the acid in the cof
fee in the faculty longue.
Just one drop of this serum is 
enough to wipe out a city of two 
hundred thousand, said the doc
tor just before tripping over the 
stool.
I dont really like to make ob
scene phone calls, its just that Im 
lonely.
Eat your cottage cheese and 
catsup and someday youll grow 
up to be a great man just like Mr.

Inside Buckys Head are 
films of Fullers presentations at 
the first World Game Seminar and 
can be considered the culmination 
of over 40 years of thinking and 
forking on how to make the world 
work. Watching him thinking is an 
incredible experience. Topics for 
the series are:
THE STRUCTURE OF NATURE 
or im going to take you to break
fast yesterday morning.
SYNERGY or nobody can throw a 
straight ball.
jiORE WITH LESS or no scientist 
has ever looked at the plumbing. 
MANS FUNCTION IN THE UNI
VERSE or im only now beginning 
to understand waterfalls.
FROM MYTH TO TECHNOLO
GY or the real story of the garden
of eden.
DESIGN ACHIEVEMENT or 
when theres enough to go around 
people dont organize to fight. 
PLAYING WORLD GAME or a 
hundred million horses going 
nowhere.
PLAYING WORLD GAME or how 
to get energy without using things 
up.
PLAYING WORLD GAME or get
ting power to the people.
WORLD GAME CAN WORK or 
politicians will yield to the com
puter.
Inside Buckys Head, a series 
of ten thirty minute films of R. 
Buckminster Fuller thinking out 
loud and rapping about his ideas, 
will be shown in Room 39, Skibo
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thur
sday, October 12-14. Tuesday and 
Wednesday there will be a con
tinuous- showing from 4:30 to 
10:00 and Thursday from 6:00 to 
11:30 PM.
Fuller has been called a kook 
and a genius. He is probably both. 
He is or has been an architect, car
tographer, cosmogonist, designer, 
engineer, inventor, mathemati
cian, philosopher, poet, thinker 
and problem solver. He has 150 
patents. 10,000 of his geodesic 
domes are scattered around the

once saw a kid who could barely 
wrap his arms around the machine 
to touch the flipper buttons, and 
was just tall enough to see over the 
edge of the machine, jiggling away 
and flipping like hell. Pinball 
machines dont respect age. Ive 
seen girls play the pinball machines 
too. Some girls are better at the 
game than guys (maybe they DO 
know how to shake it). I chal
lenged an innocent looking bespec
tacled girl in a tee-shirt to a game 
one night. Maybe I should have 
known from the cigarettes in her 
tee-shirt pocket. She subdued my 
ass good. She had 2500 points on 
her first ball. I had 123. She won a 
free game on her fourth ball.
And to my mind, that brings up 
another problem connected with
pinball machines: language.
Imagine that you are a girl (for 
some of you, this wont be too 
hard) and that you are walking 
through the Tartan Grill towards 
the lobby. As you descend the 
steps, you see a group of laughing, 
long-haired, obviously horny, de
praved boys who are all standing 
around a pinball machine. Out of 
the boisterous laughter and chat
ter, a voice questions: How many 
balls you got left? AUGH!! .. . 
your virgin ears are assaulted with 
this crass reference to a mans 
no-no (or no-nos). But then 
again you think, what if theyre 
only talking about soccer? This 
drains some of the blood from 
your face, but you almost faint as 
you hear the reply Three.
AUGH .. . LORD ... mutants, 
you think as you whip through the 
tall, wooden doors. Youre scarred 
for life; youll never give up your 
treasure. And how can girls refer to 
the balls at all?
But Im cured. I came back. I 
must admit to playing the mach
ines more than once. I once lost 
two dollars and fifty cents one 
night and didnt win one damned 
game. But ... no more Im just 
going to walk straight out of the 
elevator here in E-tower and walk

Soccer News 
Forget about the 59 champion^ 
ship game between the Baltimore 
Colts and the New York Football 
Giants. CMUs game with Pitt at 
the Skibo Bowl contained just as 
much excitement, and ultimately 
just as much disappointment for 
the team which in the end suffered 
the defeat. The end came some 10 
minutes after it was supposed to, 
as the members of both teams 
fought cautiously to a 2-2 tie in 
regulation time. Both Tartan 
scores were provided by CMU star 
center forward Peter Moses, the 
second of which came on a direct
kick from right outside the penalty 
area. Both times CMU had to come 
from behind to tie the score, once 
in the first half, once in the second. 
However, as they entered the first 
overtime period, the booters from 
CMU were visibly handicapped. 
Peter Schuller, suffering from the 
effects of the flu, could not finish 
the game. Mike Smith and Goran 
Bencic, though still in the game, 
were noticeably hampered. And 
yet the deadlock continued into 
the second and final overtime peri
od, again 5 minutes in length. At 
this point Mike Smith did leave the 
game, and after less than a minute
Pitt scored. They scored again in 
administering the coup de grace, a 
4-2 defeat which will linger pain
fully in Coach Krotees mind, at 
least for a couple of days until the 
team takes on Betheny on Wednes
day. It was not just another case of 
the one that got away, but a case 
of an upset that failed to materi
alize; the team did play well.
It was a combined effort, and 
the team would like to thank all 
those who lent support, especially 
the cheerleaders. Yankee Stadium, 
against the Colts, it was not, but 
we were proud to be there, play
ing, in red. Peter Schuller
Football
Camegie-Mellon Universitys 
Tartans will be out to bring their 
football record up to the .500 
mark this Saturday, Oct. 9, when 
they invade Ohio for the second 
time in as many weekends and go 
against Kenyon College at Gambier. Game time is 2:00 PM.
CMU is now 1-2, recording its 
first win last Saturday, 35-0 over 
Oberlin. Previously the Tartans 
lost to Thiel and Washington and 
Jefferson. The Kenyon Lords are
0-3, but two of those were onepoint losses decided in the final 
minutes of play. Kenyons losses 
were to Otterbien, 15-14; Hobart, 
27-14; and Marietta, 14-13.
Defense was the key word for 
CMU as they played spoiler last 
Saturday to the Yeomens 1971 
Homecoming. The Tartans defense 
held the Yeomen to two first 
downs rushing and one first down 
passing and just 88 yards total 
offense.
The Plaid offense, which had 
been averaging over 23 points per 
game going into the Oberlin 
match, continued to move the ball 
successfully. The CMU running 
game finally put it together and 
racked up 244 yards, paced by 
Terry Bells 110. Bell, who was 
held to a total of 91 yards in the 
first two games, for the past two 
years has been the rushing and 
scoring leader for the Tartans. Hes 
averaged 621 yards in two seasons 
(eight game seasons) and with 201 
yards currently seems headed for 
another 600+ season. His present 
career totals are 288 carries for 
1443 yards, an average of 5.4 yards 
per carry.
Second high ground gainer for 
the Tartans against Oberlin was 
second-string running back Bob 
Curtis, an elusive mite from 
Monaca. Curtis, a 56, 145 lb. 
freshman, ran for 57 yards, in 
eluding a 19 yard TD run.
The CMU offense should get a
good test against Kenyon. The 
Lords defense is led by senior cap
tain Ed Grzybowski, an Ohio Ath
letic Conference (OAC) 1st team 
selection at lineback for the past 
two years. Kenyons defensive 
secondary, paced by sophomore 
defensive back Kent McDonald 
with two interceptions, is rated 
number one in the OAC, having 
yielded just 44 yards per game to 
opponents passing. It will be a 
challenge for Tartan quarterback 
Richie Squires and wide receivers 
Charlie Price and Brian Charlock.
Kenyon has 26 lettermen back 
from last years 5-4 team, which 
finished ninth in the 14 school 
OAC. With an experienced defense 
and an improving offense, they are 
hoping to get on the wining track 
against CMU, something the Lords 
need to do if they are to realize 
their preseason expectation of a 
fourth consecutive winning sea
son. ?

Football News
Big Red is back! Saturday, the 
Tartans outhit, outplayed, and 
outscored the Oberlin Yeomen by 
the lopsided score of 35-0. And 
even though the score was 7-0 at 
halftime, the Obies were never in 
the game.
It was the defense that shined 
most brightly. Only once was 
Oberlin able to muster anything 
that resembled a threat, and even 
then they were thirty yards from 
paydirt. A blocked field goal, two 
near blocks of punts, numberous 
interceptions and fumble recover
ies and ferocious tackling was the 
mark of the Big Red D. Other 
bright spots were the perfor
mances of many subs. Chris 
OLeary, starting tight end, 
showed the fans some fancy 
running at halfback along with 
speedy Bob Curtis, who sneaked 
through gaping holes and around 
Yeomen defenders.
CMU kicked off and stopped 
Oberlin on 3 plays. The Tartans 
first drive was halted by an Oberlin 
interception, but CMU regained 
possession through Art Hunkeles 
block of an attempted field goal. 
On the next series the Tartans fum
bled, and while it was obvious that 
Big Red would win, it seemed like
theyd never get to the goal line. 
CMLPs defense again held and after 
the punt, CMU began its first TD 
drive.
Only moments after the second 
quarter began, Terry Bell carried 
the ball on 4th and goal for the 
score. Juan Neffa added the point 
and the offense had scored all the 
points that were needed.
Later in the half, Bell had 
another touchdown dash, this one 
50 yeards, called back on the first 
of numerous questionable calls by 
the clearly partisan referees. 
Nevertheless, CMU led at the half,
7-0.
The third quarter belonged en
tirely to the CMU defense. With 4 
minutes gone, Mike Braikowski in
tercepted a Yeomen pass and 
rambled 35 yards to the 6. Terry 
Bell once again took the ball across 
but Neffas kick was wide, Big Red 
led, 13-0.
The defense once again set up 
the score, initiating a series of fum
bles and interceptions that led to 
another interception by Bralkowski. This time, on the strength of 
downfield blocking by Gary Mielahn, he streaked 50 yards for the 
score. Neffas kick made it 20-0.
Then the defense again choked 
Oberlin and CMU took the punt
and drove 70 yards in 3 plays for 
another score, this time Tom Lom
bardo getting the call. Terry Bell 
drove in for the 2 point conversion 
and at the end of the third quarter, 
it was 28-0.
The fourth quarter saw plenty 
of clean white jerseys with Jim 
Allera directing the offense. Jim 
threw well, completing 4 out of 4 
passes. The second defense, led by 
Doug Mielahn thwarted the Obies 
and forced a turnover with 20 
seconds left. Bob Curtis, apparent
ly scared by the sound of the gun, 
scampered twenty yards to score 
as time ran out. Neffa added the 
last point and the tartans had won, 
35-0.
Spirit remains high this week 
and CMU is looking ahead to 
Saturdays trip to Kenyon, Ohio. 
If the defense stays tough as last 
week and the offense plays as well, 
the rest of the season should take 
care of itself. So. . . follow the 
Tartans on WRCT and start 
making your plans for the October
16 Homecoming game vs. Alle
gheny. The Red is ready!

There were no surprises when 
Meckleys merry marauders met 
Grove City; we got dusted against a 
vastly superior squad with depth 
and precision ability; Paul Cam
eron of Grove City finished the 
course with an excellent 21:28. 
While Ken Kloes and Tony McKay 
took third and sixth respectively, 
marked improvements in time 
were made by Wayne Bingham and 
Greg Hyatt. Tom Silvis, who 
joined the squad only two days 
before the meet, finished as the 
Tartan fifth man followed by Dave 
Byers.
It must be noted that the spec
tators from Grove City vastly out
numbered the throngs (two of 
CMU supporters). Whats to see? 
Ill admit, not much: a start, a
finish, and a bunch of guys bustin 
all parts of their anatomy; but be 
sure, were not running for you nor 
for the greater glory of CarnegieMellon. We run for our individual 
love of running and as a team.
So, I dont say wheres your 
school spirit because I dont par
ticularly care. But I do care about 
my teammates and about mental 
support, a greater factor to run
ning than youll every know.
Its not a waste because Schenley Park is beautiful this time of 
year. Try getting out to Flagstaff 
some nice day for a change in rou
tine ... you may even see some 
crazy bastards runnin by.

high hopes for the coming season 
due to the addition of some top

be held at 7:00 PM Tuesday Octo

in the basement of Donner Hall. 
The meeting is open to all inter

the coming season, practice times, 
and pre-season conditioning.
Coach Steva shares his teams 
optimism and has renewed the Tar

team on this years schedule. ?
I.M. Football
I.M. football starts its third 
week with some very closely 
fought races in evidence.
This could be called the year of 
the Big D, but its more like the 
year of the Little O. Only one 
team has shown any semblance of 
a strong offense. Pika has averaged 
60 points in their last two games, 
and are head on with Pepper and 
Salt to win the National League. 
P&S looks inconsistent, but still 
good. ATO gave them an excellent 
game, and a few breaks for ATO 
could have meant a big upset. The 
other National teams must start 
looking forward to next year.
In the American League, it still 
looks like the Black Magics. They 
showed a good deal of poise 
coming from behind to take Solid 
State. Beta finally got rolling in 
their win over KECC, and the Sig
TOP 8
1. Pepper and Salt
2. Pi Kappa Alpha

4. Beta Theta Pi
Alphs barely scraped past Phi Kap. 
DU must take at least 2 out of 3 
from the league leaders, and Phi 
Kap needs to split to stay in the 
race.
In the Intermediates, the Oak
land As appear to have the West all 
wrapped up. Second place could 
go to any of three teams. The East 
should go to the Clackers, as Kap
pa Sig pulled off a mild upset in 
beating the Nads.
One unfortunate note on the 
season has been the forfeiture of 
ten games due to illegalities or fail
ure to referee as required by the
I.M. Board. Hopefully this will 
clear up soon.
This weeks big games: Black 
Magics vs. SAE on Thursday at 
4:30, and Oakland As vs. Taxi on 
Friday at 4:30. ?
