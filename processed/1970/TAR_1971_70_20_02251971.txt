A preliminary draft of the 
statement had been submitted to 
students and faculty for criticism 
earlier this year, and sugges
tions for change in the docu
ment from these groups were 
helpful in deciding on the final 
draft. The earlier statement was 
discussed by the Board of Trust
ees twice last semester, and was 
approved with the provision that 
it be revised in accordance with 
the two concerns expressed by 
the Committee on Student Af
fairs. It was then agreed by the 
members of the Committee on 
Goals Rights and Responsibilit
ies to change only the second 
paragraph.
The final version of the docu
ment approved by the Board of 
Trustees appears below:
GOALS, RIGHTS, and 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
AT
CARNEGIE-MELLON
UNIVERSITY
GOALS
Carnegie-Mellon University 
is a private university incorpor
ated under the laws of the Com
monwealth of Pennsylvania. Its 
first purpose, as stated in its 
Article of Incorporation, is:
The establishment and main
tenance in the City of Pittsburgh 
of a coeducational university of 
higher education, including an
institution of technology, em
phasizing liberal-professional 
education and specializing in 
teaching and research programs 
in selected areas of importance 
to the community and the nation.
More specifically, CarnegieMellon University seeks to pro
vide education of the highest 
quality so that each student 
will be prepared to achieve his 
potential as a professional per
son and as a thoughtful, wellinformed individual. In addition, 
the University encourages and 
supports scholarship, research, 
and artistic production, both as 
essential components of its edu
cational program and in fulfill
ment of the special role of an 
academic institution as a source 
of new knowledge and under
standing. Through scholarship, 
research, and the men and wo
men it educates, the University 
contributes to social progress.
As a private university, Carnegie-Mellon is free to set its own 
measures of excellence and to de
termine its own educational ob
jectives. By carefully exercising 
the freedom to select limited 
areas for University effort, it can 
preserve its ability to be inno
vative and creative in response to 
the changing needs of society. 
In order to maintain this inde
pendence and flexibility, Car
negie-Mellon University depends 
upon the voluntary support of 
the society which it serves. It 
depends especially for its funds 
upon students and their fami
lies, alumni, trustees, founda
tions, corporations, government 
and friends. Thus, it is of the ut
most importance that the goals 
of the University be clear, and 
that the standards and proced
ures for the conduct of its affairs 
be well understood by all of its 
constituents, both on and off 
campus. These appear in detail 
in the duly promulgated regu
lations of the University, particu
larly in the catalogs, the Stu
dent Handbook and the Faculty 
Handbook. Acomitmeha om rdbh yU
ATTENTION! All candidates for 
positions in Student Govern
ment, on College Council, and 
the Presidency of the Commu
ters' Club are reminded that 
they are to have their pictures 
taken this Sunday, Feb. 28, in 
the TARTAN office, Room 50, 
Skibo, anytime during the af
ternoon. Also, statements of 
platform must be submitted to 
the TARTAN office by next 
Monday, March 1. Statements 
for the Presidential positions 
are limited to 500 words. 
Statements for the position of 
Director of Academic Affairs 
are limited to 200 words. 
Statements for all other posi
tions are limited to 50 words.

Vol. 70, No
Student GovernmentGets Corporate Arm
Last Thursday afternoon the 
Carnegie-Mellon Student Gov
ernment Corporation was offici
ally chartered in Judge Doyles 
court at the County Court 
House downtown. Judge Doyle, 
noting that this was a regional 
first, held the signing cere
monies in his chambers so 
photographs could be taken.
The incorporation was accom
plished with the generous help 
and counseling of Mr. Robert 
Flaherty, Attorney and instructor 
in G.S.I.A., who volunteered his 
services, and devised the struc
ture of the corporation so that 
the organization of Student Gov
ernment and its relationship to 
the students would not have to 
change.
The new corporation, acting 
only on the direction of the stu
dent Senate, enables the student
Mr. Robert Flaherty who gen
erously donated his service as 
an attorney
body as a whole to own property, 
sign contracts, and enter into 
legal action. In addition, it 
greatly increases Student Govern
ments potential for providing 
real services to its constituents, 
such as housing, health care, and 
other entrepreneurial projects.
The idea of a corporate arm 
of Student Government gained 
impetus last spring when the 
contract for printing the THISTLE 
came into dispute. It was felt 
that incorporation would help 
in more precisely defining Stu,dent Governments relationship 
to the University Administration.
It is emphasized that the cor
poration is only a legal identity 
through which Student Govern
ment may act when it wants to, 
and that its Board of Directors 
is distinct from officers of Stu
dent Government. In addition, 
the Board of Directors has rep
resentatives from the Universitys 
Trustees and from the city to 
ensure its responsiveness to the 
community.
President Stever has appointed 
a committee, made up of students, 
faculty, administrators, and trus
tees, to study the effects and 
potential of the Corporations 
relationship to the University.
The following are the Articles 
of Incorporation and the By-Laws 
which will be approved at the 
first meeting of the Board of 
Directors.

Goals, Rights, Response
AWS Drugstore
Duane Eilertson
Finally! Alter years of cross
ing the bridge and plodding 
through Oakland slush just to 
buy a bar of soap or a tube of 
toothpaste, the drugstore has 
come to C-MU! The new drug
store, located in a back room ad
joining C-Tower in Morewood 
Gardens, offers a variety of non
prescription items ranging from 
deoderant to cough syrup.
Since its opening, last Mon
day, the store has been a suc
cess, as its empty shelves testify. 
Popular items such as face soap 
were bought up in the first days 
business which netted the store 
$40.00. It will take several weeks 
for the store to guage student 
needs accurately and keep an 
adequate supply for the present 
demand.
Operated and managed by stu
dents on a work-study program, 
the Corner Counter Drugstore 
has been set up as a non-profit 
experiment under the auspices 
of AWS, as a convenience to the 
students. Because of its experi
mental nature, the store is sub
ject to administrative review, and 
its future depends on its volume 
of business, and the student re
sponse. The flexibility of the store 
will enable it to take sugges
tions from students as to possi
ble items it might keep in stock, 
and order them. A further advan
tage is that nearly all items are 
sold at a discount, so the student 
can save himself a few pennies 
as well as the walk to Oakland.
So go to the Corner Drug
store in C-Tower Morewood be
tween 4 and 10 P.M., Sunday 
through Thursday, or between
4 and 8 P.M. Friday and Satur
day, and stock up on all those 
things you were putting off un
til you got a chance to go to Oak
land. The drugstore is here!
IN WHITE AMERICA
by RICHARD DALE
Tuesday night Project Upward 
Bound and C-Map put on a produc
tion of Martin Dubermans IN 
WHITE AMERICA. On a stage 
sparsely furnished with only a few 
stools the all-black cast gave a 
moving montage of the black man 
in America.
The play consisted of historical 
documents: letters, diaries, in
terviews, and court transcripts 
interspersed with gospel songs to 
separate the scenes. The actors 
vividly portrayed the black mans 
struggle to be recognized as a hu
man being rather than a piece of 
property, and the white mans re
fusal to consider him more than, 
at best, an irresponsible child 
and, at worst, a beast of burden to 
be firmly controlled.
One of the most moving exam
ples of the white mans control 
was given by Laura Bookers pow
erful performance as a black 
woman, whose home was attack
ed by the Klan, telling her story 
before a court that would take no 
action.
This play is truly an education
al experience for all who see it. 
... A well acted story of the 
black mans refusal to be put 
down. I learned something that 
would never have come to me as 
powerfully in a book. I think the 
standing ovation indicated that 
the rest of the audience felt some
thing too.

ACADEMIC AND
INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM
Within the academic com
munity, trustees, administrators, 
faculty, students, and staff share 
the responsibility for achieve
ment of the goals of the Univer
sity. Responsibilities specific to 
various groups are discussed in 
the sections which follow. Es
pecially important, however, 
are the responsibilities pertain
ing to academic and individual 
freedom. An academic commun
ity is uniquely suited to its edu
cational and scholarly purposes 
primarily because of its form 
commitment to intellectual hon
esty, freedom of inquiry and ex
pression, respect for the dignity 
of each individual,* and because 
of its receptiveness to construc
tive change.
The commitment to academic 
and individual freedom carries 
with it major responsibilities for 
each member of the University. 
In exercising his own freedoms, 
each person must respect the 
rights of others. In seeking in
novation, he must recognize that 
constructive change can be af
fected at a university only 
through orderly and rational pro
cesses. Intentional acts threaten
ing personal safety, malicious 
destruction of property, or will
ful and substantial disruption of 
university functions have no place 
in an academic community and 
will not be tolerated. It is the 
responsibility of all members of 
the academic community to 
maintain an atmosphere in which 
such violations of rights are un
likely to occur and to develop 
processes which assure the pro
tection of these rights for all 
persons.
BOARD OF TRUSTEES
The trustees bear ultimate re
sponsibility for the University, 
its policies, organization, financ
ing, and governance. Two direct 
responsibilities are the super
vision f the Universitys finances 
and the appointment of the Presi
dent as chief executive officer. 
Ordinarily, the trustees do not 
involve themselves in the every
day affairs of the University. 
Rather, operating responsibilities 
and the authority to act are dele
gated to the President; and it is 
primarily through him that the 
trustees monitor the University 
activities.
The trustees have a particular 
responsibility to mediate between 
the university community and 
the larger society which the Uni
versity serves. Thus, the truste 
must be alert to the needs of the 
University, and must be willing 
and able to explain and defend 
the Universitys values, goals, 
and procedures.
It is the duty of the trustees 
to maintain the effecdiveness 
and continuity of the Board. In 
selecting new members, the 
trustees choose those who have a 
sincere interest in the University 
and whose talents and back
ground will contribute to it.
ADMINISTRATION
The administrative officers 
are formally responsible for su
pervising the programs and en
forcing the policies of the Uni
versity, for assessing the effects 
of policy, and for recommending 
improvements or changes where 
appropriate. The President, is 
the chief executive officer of the 
university. In the operation of 
the University, the President
delegates responsibility to vice 
presidents, deans, department 
heads, and to various councils 
and committees which may in
clude faculty, students, and staff. 
This delegation may be on a contihuing basis or for specified 
periods, and may be withdrawn 
or reassigned.
It is the duty of the adminis
trative officers of the University 
to maintain a campus climate 
which enhances the freedom of 
the faculty to teach, engage in 
research, and to take part in 
other scholarly and artistic activ
ities, and the freedom of the stu
dents to learn and grow both in
side and outside of the class
room. This means that all poli
cies of the University must be 
administered effectively and in 
accord with the purposes and 
standards of the University and 
with due regard to the rights 
and privileges of all members of 
the university community. In 
setting and carrying out of Uni
versity policies, it is important 
for administrative officers to 
maintain a close exchange of 
views with faculty and students, 
both individually and through 
the formally constituted com
mittees and councils of the 
University.
Administrative officers share 
with the trustees the major 
responsibility for interpreting 
University policies and actions 
to the community at large. This 
responsibility requires that ad
ministrative officers interact with 
representatives of local, state 
and federal governments, of in
dustry, foundations, and many 
other community groups in 
both formal and informal ways 
on the many matters of interest 
to the Universitys well-being.
FACULTY
The faculty has the primary 
responsibility for carrying out 
the educational and scholarly 
programs of the University.
Each member of the faculty 
has the duty to conduct his 
courses in a manner consistent 
with the highest standards of his 
profession. Through his presentativn of material in the classroom, 
he should strive to advance the 
art of teaching. One of his pri
mary goals should be to instill 
in his students a desire to learn 
and an enthusiasm for the sub
ject matter at hand. The faculty 
as a whole also has the major 
responsibility for establishing 
and maintaining curricula 
which meet the standards and ful
fill the educational goals of the 
University.
A member of the faculty 
may express in the classroom his 
own opinions on matters rele
vant to his courses. In doint this, 
he must always respect the free
dom of belief of the student. 
When dealing with controversial 
matters, he must take reasonable 
care in the selection and balanc
ed presentation of material, 
and must try to make clear dis
tinctions between statements 
of fact and of opinion.
An important responsibility 
of each faculty member is to en
gage in research, scholarship, 
artistic production, or otherwise 
to further his professional de
velopment. While the particular 
areas of University or personal 
commitment may change, con
tinuing professional development 
should always remain as a dis
tinguishing characteristic of the 
University and its faculty.
The faculty also has an impor
tant role to play in the inter
action between the University 
and the community which it 
serves. In addition to conducting 
research and otherprofessional 
activities, faculty members may 
participate like other citizens 
in community affairs. When they 
engage in non-University activi
ties, faculty members are expect
ed to make clear that they act 
as individuals and not as spokes
men for the University.
The Faculty Senate is respon
sible for conducting the affairs 
of the faculty as a body and for 
exercising those powers delegated 
to it by the President. It is the 
duty of the Senate to be alert and 
informed concerning matters in
volving instruction, scholarly or 
cultural activities, or any other 
matters pertaining to the general 
welfare of the faculty or of the 
academic community as a whole. 
By making known its views 
and recommendations concerning 
such matters, the Senate plays 
an important consultative role 
in the governance of the Univer
sity.
STUDENTS
Carnegie-Mellon, as a private 
university, selects from among 
its applicants those students who 
have demonstrated the qualifica
tions for achieving professional 
competence in one of the fields 
in which the University offers 
instruction. Any student who 
meets its standards is welcome 
to apply for admission and to re
main at the University so long as 
he abides by its rules.
Students are encouraged to 
take advantage of the resources 
provided by the University to fur
ther their academic and personal 
development. Each student is 
expected to meet the academic
requirements of the University, 
and of the college and depart
ment in which he studies and 
seeks to receive a degree. In 
turn, each student has the right 
to expect that the educational 
resources made available to 
him are of high quality. He is 
encouraged to participate con
structively with the faculty and 
administration in many of those 
processes by which the Univer
sity community maintains the 
excellence of its curricula and 
methods of instruction, and the 
viability of its total educational 
program.
The University sponsors cer
tain extra-curricular programs 
and makes provisions for various 
student governing bodies and 
other groups to sponsor a wide 
variety of lectures, social events, 
and other activities. A student is 
encouraged to participate in 
such activities and has the right 
to engage in other activities in 
the community outside the Uni
versity. Both kinds of activities 
may complement his academic 
program and promote his own 
personal development. In par
ticipating in non-University 
activities, students are expected 
to make clear that they act as 
individuals and not as spokes
men for the University.
The Student Government is 
responsible for conducting the 
affairs of the student body and 
for exercising those powers which 
are delegated to it by the Presi
dent of the University. It is 
the duty of Student Government 
to represent the positions and atti
tudes of the student body, to 
bring these student opinions to 
the attention of the faculty 
and administration, and to seek 
additional areas of useful inter
action.

TAYLOR MADE UNIFORMS '
A select number of the C-MU security squad personnel are sporting subtle new attire. The J , 
new garb adopted yesterday by the four Security Co-ordinators (formerly addressed as Sergeants)^ 
replaces more traditional patrolman-type uniforms. The Co-ordinators' novel outfits are comprised !' 
of blue or gold blazers complemented by dark trousers. Outside wear includes a warm beige i 
bush coat highlighted by an imposing fedora (Compliments of Murphy's 5 & 10, Fox Chapel 1
Shopping Plaza). Visibility of the function of the Co-ordinators is insured by a colorful "security'!
services" patch sported on both blazers and bush coats. This indentification patch, which inte- I 
grates a Pennsylvania-inspired keystone and the C-MU official emblem, was designed by Co- 1. 
ordinator Eddie Biernesser (see photographs). Biernesser and others on the squad determined 
the style of the new uniforms. Other security personnel will continue uniformed as before, but [) 
there are thoughts in the wind that in the not-too-distant future they may be inspired by the Co- i 
ordinators' attire and follow suit. H)

film is 8V2 .... 1 want to 
bring in new things, not the same 
old tired group weve all seen a 
dozen times before.
Well, it will be a good series, 
and, along with McTaggert, we 
pray for support. The shows 
will be on Sunday night, two 
shows a night, enabling all to 
close off your mind and float 
downstream. Says the good Phd.; 
I hope its a big success, not be
cause of any fame Im seeking, 
but because I know how excit
ing this type of thing can be. 
This campus is dead and a film 
series of this sort can generate a 
lot of life. If we flop, Im going 
to be terribly disappointed. 
Considering the interest in 
films (GOOD films) at C-MU, 
the McTaggert celluloid spec
tacular should be a welcome 
breath of fresh air. It should 
prove to be the aesthetic boost 
film-lovers crave. (By the way, 
lest its meaning be misinter
preted, S.T.A.G. means Spiro T. 
Agnew Generation, not an entire 
series of skin flicks.)

Meeting for the first time since 
its incorporation last Thursday, 
Senate this week, much to the 
pleasure of Senators and news
paper reporters, was unusually 
brief and interesting.
President Cavanagh told the 
sparsly attended meeting that as 
a result of Student Government 
Incorporation, the Senate has be
come responsible for the adminis
tration of the student health 
insurance program. He asked for 
three student volunteers to serve 
on the committee which will ad
minister the program, determin
ing the kind of insurance policy 
the students desire and how much 
they are willing to pay.
KILTIE DISBANDED
The Kiltie Band is likely to 
fall victim to the Administrations 
budget cutting, Dean Swank 
told the Senate. The Kiltie Band 
has been performing on campus 
about three times a year at foot
ball games, costing about $2,000 
a year.
Dean Swank pointed out that 
cutting the Kiltie Band will less 
effect the general student body 
than any other budget cut would. 
The pipers most likely will be 
maintained, he said.

the room, and any other group 
interested in gaining the remain

Bill Iacono was uncontestedly 
and unanimously re-elected to 
the position of Director of the 
Activities Board.
DISPLACEMENT
Steve Borth recommended 
that Senate support a motion to 
move the Placements office out 
of Skibo by 1971-72, to make 
room for student organizations.
Skibos director, Bob McCur
dy, reminded the Senate that 
plans for Skibos renovation have 
already called for the displace
ment of the Placements Bureau, 
perhaps to Scaife of Porter Hall. 
Senate then voted in favor of 
Borths recommendation with 
only two Senators opposed.
NEW RULES

that during the upcoming spring

English Professors STAG Films 
Saved By H&SS Dean Hayes
by Debbie Holdstein
With talent, a catchy title, and 
a program of quality, short cel
luloid masterpieces, Professor 
William McTaggart of the Eng
lish Department will begin a 
new film series under the elo
quent, catch-all moniker, S.T.A.
G. Movies. In the words of the 
professor, The undertalented 
Mike Nichols, Next to winning 
the Noble Prize for literature I 
most wish somebody would give 
me a billion dollars to make the 
best movie in history. For the 
time being, however, we shall 
all be satisfied to begin with 
the new C-MU film series, the 
first of five programs scheduled 
for March 28th.
The purpose, briefly, is to 
bring to C-MU the best in short 
films - of which Pittsburgh has 
been so needlessly deprived. 
There will be documentaries of 
the Laurel and Hardy variety, 
animation of every sort, under
ground and experimental films. 
There isnt a lousy film in the 
bunch, quoth McTaggart. Ive 
booked such golden greats as 
Steamboat Willie, such under
ground zingers as Scorpio Ris
ing, a documentary on the Kent 
State Disaster, and Busby Berk- ely.
I was distraught all last year 
to see what poor movies were be
ing shown at C-MU, and, es
pecially, at the Pittsburgh Play
house. I dreamed of setting up 
a film series here ... I tried 
to get Student Senate backing to 
cover any possible financial 
losses, but I encountered aston
ishing amounts of beaurocracy, 
so I gave up. The saviour of
S.T.A.G. movies became Dean 
Hayes of H&SS, a fantastic man 
full of good ideas, who gener
ously offered his support. With
in two days this past February, 
McTaggart had booked projec
tion rooms, projectionists, and 
fifty-one movies!
The C-MU film series is based 
on much of McTaggarts work 
as a student at Ohio University, 
where he ran a similar program 
for two years, he April 4 th 
program will consist of seven
teen animated films, with suc
cessive programs mingling the 
old and new of the best of short 
silent, classic, and experimental 
works, with several programs 
concentrating on one of these 
genres.
With enthusiasm that has been 
lost at Tech since the 39 Rose 
Bowl, McTaggart is truly putt
ing heart, soul, and energy into 
the film project. Students have 
to make a committment when 
they come to see these movies
 theyre not there just for en
tertainment  McTaggart wants 
students to be inspired by the 
careful work of excellent film
makers  they should see these 
films and say I can do that  
thats what Im looking forward 
to.
The showcase will spotlight 
the talented people who are not 
seen enough. Even the early, sil
ent comedies that are still rele
vant, still funny, just are not 
being seen. Many of these 
film makers are using cameras 
as if theyve never been used 
before  theyre * beautiful. 
This is evident in all of McTag
garts selections.
The film series is certainly in
expensive for its quality  99c 
per show. Hopefully, the series 
will turn a profit, leading to a 
great expansion of full length 
films for fall. I dream someday 
of bringing in entire weekends 
of movies, running 24 hours a 
day for about 3 days, kids drop
ping *in and leaving as they 
please. In the fall, recent un
noticed Foreign Films will be 
brought in, among other feature 
films and documentaries such 
as Monterey Pop. Unfor
tunately, the idea of the foreign

Happy and Artie Traum
the rest of New York is often
times a drag to have to be in, but 
last year at this time thats where 
we were  hoping to get our first 
live listen to James Taylor who 
was headlining the evenings bill.
The Gaslight was at its best 
which is the bestmost surely for 
J.T. after two guys came onstage 
looking just like two guys. Most 
folks had come for James Taylor, 
but Happy and Artie Traum (the 
before-mentioned two guys), with 
the great work of Mike Esposito 
on bass, calmed the restless fan
nies of us Taylor people. Two fel
lows from Woodstock playing old 
fat guitars and singing the way 
they ought to with such instru
ments.
It was ruddy and dark and ev
eryone had come for music. Hap 
and Art are fantastic; an upstate 
New York country sound as fine 
as the Bands, though, vastly dif
ferent. It looks like we got our
selves some good new Eastern 
upstate country musicians with 
brains and a bit of God as well.
They have an album available 
on the Capitol label and are cur
Well into the second semester, 
the C-MU Activities Board is con
tinuing a series of popular music 
concerts. Since school began last 
fall we have been trying to sched
ule an appearance of the Traum 
Brothers and now that all neces
sary negotiations have been 
made, they will at last be per
forming in concert  Saturday 
night, March 6, at 8:30 in the 
Skibo Ballroom. In the spirit of 
the Seals and Crofts concert that 
was held last autumn, it is once 
again our pleasure to present this 
show FREE to all C-MU students. 
An admission fee is not required 
of anyone with a Carnegie-Mellon 
ID. Otherwise, admission is only 
$1.50 per head.
Happy and Artie Traum have 
been the subject of recent articles 
in the latest issues of Rolling 
Stone Magazine. They are most 
familiar to those who have known 
them from gigs in their hometown 
of Woodstock, N. Y., or from cof
fee house engagements in New 
York City.

HAROLD PINTERS COMEDY OF MENACE
and on the same program 
Fifth Street by Robert MacAndrew
Harold Pinter's plays are simple stories told with an economy of language that isolates and captures the thundering banalities and silences of human communication. To put this kind of drama on the screen is extremely challenging. Films have always seemed to be most effective in dealing with physical action while silences on the screen have usually resulted in intense audience boredom. In THE BIRTHDAY PARTY, director William Friedkin in his first film solves this problem without having to resort to cheap visual excitement at the expense of the play's integrity. He has created the suspense and tension of a mystery while retaining both Pinter's shadings of whispers and shouts as well as his ironic, deadly humor. Friedkin's talent in this area has again been proven by his most recent film, THE BOYS IN THE BAND.Pinter's world is a literary and dramatic microcosm in which insignificant details are amplified to create climaxes from situations which would otherwise go unnoticed. A sense of menace and primitive fear occurs throughout his work similar to when an innocent drop of water is seen through a microscope to contain a teeming unseen life This is Pinter's method an uncommon view of common events and situations. We find ourselves in a bizarre world of ambiguous, abstract thoughts surrounded by alarmingly specific objects because Pinter consciously eliminates any rational explanation of either his perspective or his characters' motivations.The film gains additional power through its brilliant casting. As the man whose birthday it is, Robert Shaw is the very embodiment of fear and guilty repression Shaw has always been associated with Pinter and his performance in THE CARETAKER and his new career as a playwright (THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH) have made him one of the major figures of British and American theatre and films. The supporting cast is equally memorable Dandy Nichols, one of Britain's most popular television stars plays the landlady. Patrick Magee, unforgettable as the Marquis de Sade in MARAT. SADE joins with the splendid Sidney Tafter as Shaw's sinister Irish and Jewish tormentors.The combination of cast, Pinter and director Friedkin have created a memorable tour de force in a universe you might not want to live in, but one in which you will have a stunning visit.On the same program, we have included a remarkable short film, FIFTH STREET. Robert MacAndrew has delved powerfully and sensitively into the world of derelicts in Los Angeles to produce a document that is sometimes shocking and painful, but never banal or gratuitous.

Henry David Thoreau and the 
Brothers Berrigan is the title of 
the sermon for Sunday, Feb. 28, 
at 11 a.m. at the First Unitarian 
Church, Ellsworth and Morewood 
Aves., Shadyside. Of all the transcendentalist circle only Thoreau 
continues to have a vigorous fol
lowing among the young and old 
alike. The Berrigan brothers, 
among those who agree with their 
destruction of draft files and those 
who do not, have an equally di
verse and devoted following. In a 
world without heroes, sensitivity 
and courage are rare and puzzled 
virtues.
Following the performances, 
Brother John Rydgen, an or
dained minister and former host 
of ABC-FMs Love program, 
will discuss with the artists the 
meaning of todays music. Their 
attitudes will be examined in 
relation to the use of drugs by 
todays youth.
Psychologist and radio TV 
personality, Dr. Joyce Brothers, 
and NBCs commentator, Edwin 
Newman will give their points 
of view regarding todays mu
sic.
Accusations that rock music 
encourages young people to 
experiment with drugs is con
trasted to musics positive values 
as contained in its inherent 
ability to communicate ideas. 
Also covered in these conver
sations are the rock cults per
ception of society in the 60s 
and 70s. The idea of being free 
to do their own thing is re
peatedly stressed as a fundamen
tal theme in rock music.
A comparison is made between 
youths response to the vibra
tions and the adult generations 
inability to understand the tech
nological culture which they 
control.
Walt Kelly, creator of the car
toon strip Pogo will speak at 
the Chatham College Chapel 
on Monday March 1, at 8:30 
p.m.
His talk, We have met the 
enemy and he is us, is open to the public without charge.
Kelly describes Pogo as 
an adult comic strip, with the 
swamp dwellers getting into 
the same silly scrapes that 
adults get into.
The cartoonist, who works on 
his strip up to 18 hours a day, 
says that what he is trying to 
convey in his strip is that we 
should all try to get along with 
one another.
Kelly started as a reporter for 
the Bridgeport, Conn. Post & 
Telegram where he doubled as 
a cartoonist drawing a strip on 
the life of P.T. Barnum. He later 
worked at the Disney Studios 
in California.
An exhibit of sculpture, draw
ings and watercolors by Carl 
Heeschen, professor of art at 
Allegheny College, opened in

The hands and voices that 
bring to life the newest stage 
production of Collodis well
loved Pinocchio story, weave 
a magic not unlike those fabled 
forces that turned the longnosed puppet into a real boy. 
The Nixon Theatre presenta
tion is the Broadway musical 
for children, which opens a 
six day engagement beginning 
Tuesday March 9 thru Suhday 
March 14.
Master Puppeteer, Bobby
Clark, knows how to make such 
magic work. He has created 102 
life-size marionettes, from two 
to six feet tall, for this Broad
way musical production of the 
childrens classic. Pittsburgh
will have a chance to witness 
the effects of his magic when
Pinocchio opens at the Nixon 
Theatre, for a total of 14 per
formances during this brief en
gagement.
Unlike many little puppet 
or marionette shows the lavish 
Reuben Budrow Production looms 
large and grandiose on stage.
Not evident to the audience are 
the six men and two women oper
ating as the unseen hands 
manipulating 7.000 feet of con
trol lines. Each marionette hangs 
on its own 16-foot line, while 
the operators work from a 
specially designed scaffold 16 
feet above the stage and scenery.
Clarks Pinocchio still tells 
the classic story of the little 
puppet who is brought to life 
by a fair. If he learns honesty, 
kindness, faithfulness, and 
bravery, he will become a 
real boy. Clark sought to cre
ate a Broadway musical for 
children, and he retained the 
virtues and moral lessons of the 
classic, while eliminating the 
frightening elements.
Eli Wallach and Jo Van Fleet 
star in the two part story of 
Clifford Odets portrait of a 
decaying middle class in Amer
ica during the 1930s, Paradise 
Lost, which will be aired Feb
ruary 25 and March 4 at 8:30 
p.m. on Channel 13.
The story centers on the family 
of Leo and Clara Gordon and a 
series of misfortunes that cul
minates in the loss of their 
house. Leo is a sympathetic, 
idealistic, man, somewhat vacil
lating and slow to take action.
Clara is tougher and more 
realistic than her husband, less 
tolerant of people who wrong 
them, yet a sympathetic charac
ter in her own way. They have 
three children: Ben, an older
son who married at the start 
of the play; Julius, the younger 
son who is afflicted with encephniu&ica
The great musical works of 
pre-18th Century composers 
ranged from the somber and 
sacred to the earthy and elegant.
Audiences are almost always 
listening to and watching New 
York Pro Musica.
The brilliant young group will 
give a single performance this 
Saturday, February 27 at 8:30 
p.m. in the Craft Avenue Theatre 
of the Pittsburgh Playhouse in 
Oakland.
New York Pro Musica is a soph
isticated group of instrumental
ists and vocalists who combine 
virtuosity and versatility in pre
senting the great musical master 
pieces of the Medieval, Renais
sance, and Baroque periods.
Utilizing instruments of the 
past such as the Krummhorn, 
the pasleery, and the sackbut, 
the young members of Pro Mus
ica are capable of turning a con
cert into an exciting excursion 
into the great musical past.

A portrait of the well-known 
and of ten controversial Ameri
can author Henry Miller, filmed 
mainly at his home in suburban 
Los Angeles, is the subject of 
Realities: The World of Henry 
Miller, to be shown Monday, 
March 1 at 9 p.m. on Channel
13.
Reflective in mood, Miller 
reminisces at length in the pro
gram about his life and work, 
about the old days as an expatri
ate in Paris, and about his long 
and prolific career as a writer.
Miller himself reads extracts 
from his own works, such as 
Tropic of Cancer; Tropic of 
Capricorn, his travel book on 
Greece, The Coossus of 
Maroussi, the collection of 
stories and sketches, Black 
Spring, and the essay, The 
Staff of Life.
Miller says his insight into 
human nature derives from his 
humble beginnings. I was born 
in the street and raised in the 
street. . . In the street you learn
alitis; and Pearl, an introverted 
girl devoted chiefly to her 
piano studies.
Also living in the Gordon 
house are Leos hard-nosed busi
ness partner, Sam Katz, and 
his wife, Bertha (they own a 
small handbag manufacturing 
concern, and Gus Michaels, 
father of Bens bride, Libby.
Despite the tragedies of the 
play, including Bens violent 
death and the progression of 
Juliuss disease, the mood is 
not one of unbroken gloom and 
depression. In the words of 
literary critic Harold Clurman: 
The love which the author feels 
for all his characters. . . his 
deep physical attachment to the 
middle class, paradise, gives the 
play a subtle but constant exaltation.

what human beings really are 
otherwise you invent them. What 
is not in the open street is 
false, derived that is to say, 
literature.
Reflecting on his ten years 
of misery as an aspiring writer 
in New York, Miller tells how 
he cribbed stories from maga
zines, changed the beginnings 
and ends and the names, and 
sold them back to the same mag
azines.
Miller was disheartened with 
this country upon his return 
from Europe and has remained 
so since. The country is re
ally going to hell, and going 
rapidly, he says. This country 
has the wrong slant towards 
lifematerialism, the scientific 
trend, the importance of businers world and the domination 
of that world over everything, 
the lack of aesthetics.
An artist who is non-com
mercial, Miller states, has 
about as much chance for sur
vival as a sewer rat.

C-MU Games
by COLLINS
The subject of this column is 
neither a Stork sport nor a Di
versionary Tactic. This instead 
is the prime activity of a large 
number of Carnegie money stu
dentsour campus loves to play 
games. Why not let the unenlight
ened in on the fun.
You can join in the Involvement 
Game. It can be played by two or 
more students (two is the mini
mum number required to form a 
concerned group of citizens) 
and has simple, easy-to-learn 
rules. All you have to do is get 
involved in something and make 
others thinks it important. You 
lose the game if anything you do 
actually helps your cause. The im
portant thing is to take sides of an 
issue and urge futile action. In
volvement games around C-MU 
include the lettuce-pickers sym
pathy club, the Angela Davis 
game, and the Spray-Paint Revol
utionary League. Some involve
ment, such as the Cambodia and 
Laos Get-out-of Game, and the 
Dow-Gulf Boycott Bonanza, isnt 
really a game at all, for the stu
dents actually accomplish their 
goal. The other games, howeverremain games. It is certain that 
the Lettuce Growers of Califor
nia will recognize the Farm
workers Union as soon as Skibo 
serves parsley instead of lettuce 
with Jell-o salads. It is also cer
tain that Skibo will stop serving 
lettuce because of a circular ly
ing around on its tables. Support 
all boycotts, gamesters. You 
might fool people into thinking 
youre actively concerned.
Then theres the psychology 
game. Has an enormous appeal 
here, and is particularly acute in 
H&SS departments. The rules of
this game require the player to 
analyze his friends and profes
sors, Nixons motives for select
ing Agnew, and Agnews superior
ity complex. The player can base 
his theories on Freud, Jung, or 
his friend who takes psych. It 
doesnt matterthe participant 
has to read the minds of his vic
tims in any manner accepted. 
Soon after leaving college, the 
player usually loses interest in 
the game, and is too wrapped up 
in his job and financial state to 
psychoanalyze anything but the 
stock market. Its fun to play 
while still in C-MU, though. Play 
God with others minds. The play
er is omniscient, and the playing 
board is the collective brain of 
every other C-MU student. Im in 
the game, too, or I wouldnt be 
writing this bullshit.
Some wrap themselves up into 
their CIT blankets and participate 
in something known as the Science-Will-Save-Mankind Game. 
These players give C-MU the repuatation it has had for a good 
while (what an engineering 
school?). The players of the Sci
ence Game actually believe that 
their field, whether it be com
puter science, chemical engi
neering, metallurgical engineer
ing, or locomotive engineering, 
has the key to making earth a bet
ter place to live. Every player 
hopes to invent something some
day that will revolutionize the 
world. (Revolutionize the 
world and invent a bomb.) The 
trouble is, the same thing that 
happens to these players as the 
psychology game players: after 
college, theyll settle down, and a 
company will buy them for $21,-
000 a year. Join a country club and

Last week we complained about 
the content of this column in past 
weeks; well, were writing it now. 
Hopefully, we will be able to come 
through and not fall to the same 
criticism we gave.
As a result of a regional con
vention of Pi Kappa Alpha had two 
weeks ago, many discussions in 
our house have centered around 
the topic of co-educational frater
nities or their variations. One of 
the most interesting arrange
ments that was offered at the con
vention was the one adopted by a 
chapter at Trinity College in Hart
ford, Conn.
Since their school has been co
ed for only two years, having girls 
around is a relatively new experi
ence for them. To help integrate 
the girls with what was previous
ly strictly male situation, they in
vented what they call the socialsister program. They began by 
sending invitations to small 
groups of girls to come over for 
dinner. Going through a proce
dure similar to rush, they select
ed several girls to enter this pro
gram. The girls have much the 
same rights and responsibilities 
as associate members. They 
come to all meals and social 
events and have a vote on finan
cial matters (since they are pay
ing for their meals and social 
events).
The chapter at Trinity has real
ly enjoyed their experience. They 
say that it gives them a chance to 
develop relationships with girls
on a brother-sister basis rather 
than a dating basis. It has brought 
new ideas into the fraternity and 
given the brothers a new outlook 
on many issues.
With the new restrictions envi
sioned on the dorm system for 
next year (i.e., requiring dorm 
residents to eat on contract un
less associated with a fraternity;, 
the possibility of initiating a so
cial-sister program along these 
lines would seem pretty good. Not 
only would it offer a chance to es
cape eating at Skibo for some 
girls, but it would add a new and 
much-needed dimension to the 
fraternity system on this campus. 
As far as going completely co-ed 
by initiating girls and having them 
live in the houses, there are not 
only problems with the school but 
with national fraternity organiza
tions too.
We hope weve put your thought 
process in gear with this short 
article. If you have any questions, 
comments, etc. on this topic or 
any other, whether you be Greek 
or not, sent them to the TARTAN 
or come and see us at Pika and 
join in our discussios.

Thursday, FebruaryAh, that was shitty! Lets try it again!. . UIPUAFI IHMHARRAniM i__________________________________________________^ Oby MICHAEL JOHN HARBADIN 
R For its second concert of the 
semester, the CMU Activities 
Board presented Don Crawford 
and Seatrain in the Skibo Ball
room last Saturday night. The 
audieice at both shows was not 
a capacity crowd, but was highly 
appreciative of the talents of 
both acts, which gave one of the 
best concerts of this year. Don 
Crawford, a singerguitarist who 
usually works the coffeehouse cir
cuit, started off each show, de
lighting the audience with his 
personal style and delivery. The 
essence of Dons act is the warm 
and sensitive rapport he estab
lishes with his audience; he is 
a performer who gives as much 
of himself as a person as he does 
as a musician.
^ At the beginning of any per
formance, it usually takes a little 
time for the audience to warm 
up to the performer, and vice 
versa. This is not the case with 
Don Crawford; you can feel 
him as soon as he comes on 
stage, glowing with an unmis
takable exuberance for his music 
and his life. Hiya doin? he 
asks of you in such a complete
ly relaxed way that you cant 
help but respond knowing and 
feeling that he has something 
of himself to give to you and 
you know you can share it with 
him, perhaps giving something 
of yourself in return.
Minstrel, poet, and storyteller, 
Don told tales and sang songs 
emanating mostly from his per* sonal experience. He told of
The Midnight Special, which 
comes by twice a day, but its 
not really a train - its the blues, 
and it can hit you at any time of 
the day. He told of his father, 
and how much I found out that 
I loved him, just last year, al
though he had died some time 
ago. My Daddy Gave Me Wings 
. of Wax, was the song Don
wrote in his memory, and its 
message was received strongly by 
the audience:
I cant go the way my fathers 
went
But maybe I can be the one 
To help to change the way 
Or could it be that Ive flown 
too close to the sun?
This song is based on the an1 cient Greek myth of Icarus and
Daedalus, a father and son who 
escaped from Crete by using 
wings that Daedalus had made. 
(My Daddy gave me wings of 
wax that he himself had made.) 
However, the curious Icarus flew 
so high that the sun melted the 
wax by which his wings were 
attached, and he drowned in the 
sea. Crawfords statement exemp
lifies the feelings of a young 
man who is torn between his loy
alty and love of his father (or 
parents) and his unrestrainable 
youthful need to explore life be
yond the bounds of his own
world, in hopes that he can find 
something better. Dons songs 
come from within, but they 
reach us on every level, stem
ming from the wisdom and in
sight of a man who has flown 
too close to the sun many times 
in his life. His truthfulness 
comes through in many ways 
when he is performing: At the 
first show, the audience wasnt 
clapping loud enough along 
with the rhythm of one song, and 
Don stopped the song and said, 
Ah, that was shitty! Lets try 
it again! The audience cracked 
up and they tried it again. It 
was better the second time. At 
one point, when the audience 
failed to respond to his com
ment that, We (the Black race) 
invented blod plasma, sugar 
cubes and Rock n Roll!, Don 
countered with Youd better 
do your homework. Touche and 
Right On, Don. If you saw Don 
Crawford perform, be thankful 
that you did. He is one of the 
few persons who can relate to 
an audience in the truthful and 
all-giving way that he does. If 
you missed him at last weeks 
concert and last semesters cof
feehouse, hope that he comes 
back. His current album on the 
Roulette label, Would You 
Understand My Nakedness? 
contains many of the songs he 
did last week, if you would like 
to hear them again. I know I 
would.
Seatrain, a band of accomp
lished musicians making their 
national debut, also graced Skibos 
stage that night. Seatrain is a 
derivative of the old Blues Pro
ject, which has gone through 
many personnel changes, and in 
its final form consists of the 
following musicians: Andy Kulberg, former bassist and flutist 
for the Blues Project; Peter Ro
wan, former guitarist, composer 
and vocalist with Earth Opera; 
Lloyd Baskin, organist-pianist 
who was formerly with the Bos
ton production of Hair; 
Richard Greene, former bluegrass fiddler for the Jim Kweskin Jug Band; Larry Atamanuick, 
former drunken poet, who is now 
drunken lyricist for Seatrain, 
traveling with the others on 
their current tour. In an inter
view at WRCT, Roberts stated 
that the campus revolutionary 
movement was hypocritical. 
When asked why, he stated 
that . . . every spring they come 
out andthrow rocks. Senator 
McCarthy says that the anti
war movement is showing a 
certain prudent restraint. 
When Peter Rowan was question
ed about his Earth Opera album 
American Eagle Tragedy, he 
said it was done because peotopical, Andy Kulberg replied 
that Its just beginning to be 
topical. Roberts, Kulberg, and 
Rowan all agreed that the time 
was right, Now that Seatrain 
is tight, musically, for Sea
train to make a statement relat
ing to the countrys present con
dition. They all expressed inter
est in Seatrain remaking Ameri
can Eagle Tragedy. During the 
course of the conversation, the 
concept was formed that Sea
train implies an image of a 
spiritual vessel, spreading 
The Truth to its people, 
saving them and their children 
from the forseeable deluge that 
will soon come like a sign of 
warning from heaven, destroy
ing the dying nation of Atlantis 
America:
We watched the city wakening 
To fill with robot kings and 
pawns
Walking round in the shadow of 
their days 
Broken morning will soon be 
gone
And the evening will not be 
long
Come the dawning well see the 
sun
(Broken Morning/Kulberg and 
Roberts)
Seatrains performances that 
night were well received by both 
audiences. They have a very 
tight, cohesive sound, a fusion of 
all of the elements and experi
ences of their members. Lloyd 
Baskins stage training is evi
dent in his vocal strength and 
dramatic delivery. He and Peter 
Rowan provide most of the lead 
vocals, with Kulberg and Rich
ard Greene providing strong 
vocal backup when necessary. 
Rowans showmanship was ex
hibited in Song of Job, a kind 
of sing-song narrative about a 
righteous man, where he ap
peared to be a singin, foot stomp
in, wailin preacher from the 
Bible Belt, puttin everything 
straight about Satan and the 
ways of God: Whore these who 
claim to know my workings and 
all my ways? Job has proved 
his faith and shall live joyous 
days. It was a little more hu
morous than it is on record, 
with the other members of the 
band adding sly comments, and 
Greene making embarassing 
sound effects on his violin at 
the most dramatic moments. 
Richard Greene is the most able 
exponent of the violin and viola 
in rock music I have heard to 
date. As technically able as vio
linists Sugarcane Harris or Doug 
Kershaw, he has it over other 
rock violinists like Jerry Good
man of the Flock, and David 
LaFlamme of It's a Beautiful
pie were so numb to what was Day, who was auditioned for
going on. The album, a satiri- Seatrain before Green was. His
cal look at American life, is knowledge of country and bluea few years old, and when some- grass music adds an invaluable
one commented that Its still dimension to Seatrains' sound,
as he throws in beautiful riffs 
and solos which precisely comp
liment the mood and flavor of 
the music, and then fades into 
the background, often sounding 
like a guitar, an organ or amaz
ingly enough, like another voice. 
Greens control of his instru
ment is such that he is able to 
make incredible dynamic changes 
without lessening the impact 
or strength of the bands sound. 
He also plays an amplified man
dolin, utilizing and manipulating 
the sound in the same way. An 
extra facet is added to his sound 
by his use of a wah-wah pedal 
(what Hendrix often used) and 
other electronic amplifying 
techniques. The only person that 
comes close to Greenes techni
cal control, inventiveness, and 
musical sensitivity is the violin
ist from McKendree Spring, 
Mike Dreyfuss, who leans to
ward the more lyrical sound of 
the violin and viola.
Andy Kulberg fascinated the 
crowd when he put down his 
bass and picked up his flute for 
a rendipon of Flute The Blues 
Projects classic instrumental 
piece. Utilizing a Ring Modula
tor, which is used by Don Ellis 
in his wildly electronic big band 
solos, Kulberg elaborated on the 
basics of the song, adding a sus
tained echo solo in which he 
was able to build chords with his 
flute, adding note upon note as 
the sounds were sustained. Kul
berg, in his green jump suit and 
feathered leather hat, added a 
bit of through-the-looking-glass 
fantasy as he hopped, elf-like, 
around the stage, lit by a purple 
spotlight, blowing magical 
notes of many colors through his 
shiny silver flute. That was the 
only time during the concert 
when I wished that I was ston
ed. Ialmost got off on just watch
ing that elf blowing all that fine 
stuff. Oooooooweeeee.
Larry Atamanuick had a chance 
to shine during Flute Thing, 
also, and he did, exhibiting those 
talents which Seatrain picked 
him for when they were looking 
for a professional drummer. 
As most of the other instru
ments usually are concerned with 
the melodic aspect of the total 
sound, Larry has to carry the 
brunt of the rhythm, and he 
does it very well, adding his 
own rhythymic individualism to 
the comples, but cohesive sound 
of Seatrain. Their total show 
was fantastic. I was amazed to 
hear how much they sound like 
the album. George Martin, for
mer producer of the Beatles, 
and engineer Bill Price have 
succeeded in capturing the es
sence of Seatrains sound on 
their new album for Capitol, 
Seatrain, (what else?) with
out the use of any phoney and 
hyped-up electronic fakery.

Very Good,Overall
by MICHAEL JOHN HARBADIN 
by Michael John Harbadin
..The CMU Student Gallery re
opened its doors to the campus 
and surrounding community 
Friday night, February twelfth, 
for a new photography exhibi
tion. A typical Gallery opening, 
the evening was punctuated by 
canned beer, buttered pretzels, 
buttered and canned people, but 
highlighted mainly by the shows 
photography. The show contain
ed a rich variety of over a hun
dred prints, the work of twentyfour CMU students.
Whether it is the result of the 
common environments of the 
photographic art at this time, or 
simply the judgement of those 
who selected work for the show, 
many similar themes, technical 
effects, and statements were evi
dent in the show as a whole. 
This situation has its inherent 
advantages and disadvantages, 
which are noticeably evident as 
one simply views the exhibit. 
There were too many long shots 
of the outdoors (landscape-type 
shots). This is not bad in itself, 
but the exhibited shots were not 
of a distinct enough individual
istic quality that each could be 
judged in itself. Seth Karpen 
contributed many very good shots 
of this type, but each seemed to 
be smothered by the sheer abun
dance of the others. Often, good 
shots are passed over for no rea
son other than the fact that the 
viewer is visually saturated with 
a particular series of the same 
type of shot. However, this is 
more a problem of selectivity 
by the judges of the exhibition, 
and is easily solved. In an exam
ple where prints with a similar 
theme had a positive effect in 
complementing the other, two 
photographs by Yoko Walsh and 
Bob Schwanke come to mind. In 
this case, the two prints express 
a view of the wild animals re
lation to civilization, or, the free
dom and spontanaity of the ani
mal world in contrast to mans 
constructed world, or, on a pure
ly visual level, the grace and 
movement of birds in flight con
trasted with the solidity and 
structural geometry of modern 
city buildings. Although the two 
prints were hung together in an 
all too obvious arrangement 
which invites instant judgement 
of them as a pair, and inevitable 
comparison, the final effect is 
pleasureable, for it affords the 
viewer a chance to observe works 
by two artists who have express
ed thoughts and feelings on the 
same subject. Moreover, this 
theme is stated in a subtle and 
effective manner with the inclu
sion of only a few prints.
Singularity or aloneness was 
another theme evident in the 
show. It was well expressed by 
Harvey Kaplan in a few shots 
of a child and a wagon, Joel 
Metzgers print of a single man 
walking on a road, and Don 
Whipples nude studies. Each ar
tist employed a separate tech
nique which individualized his 
work, and augmented and en
hanced the effect of each photo
graph. Joels use of perspective 
and his feeling for composition 
were the strong points in his 
print. Kaplans cropping (select
ing and cutting out the best part 
of the print) and his use of 
space and size were helpful in 
projecting his prints in the most 
communicative and simple fash
ion. However, one of his shots 
was so small that a person with 
bad eyesight or a long nose 
couldnt possibly get close en
ough to appreciate the great solarization effect that was done on 
it. (Solarization is a process of 
exposing a print to light during 
development, so that it takes on 
a very metallic, unusual con
trast. Different parts of the print 
develop halos around them and 
greys evolve that could never be 
achieved by normal develop
ment.) Don Whipples use of ex
isting light and shadow in his 
female nude studies established 
a separate mood and distinc
tive mood in each. His male 
nude holding a guitar, and Geoffery Frieds shot of a man and 
a balloon in a parade added a 
light touch of comic relief to an
otherwise humorless exhibit.
..Norn Rehms study of the Iwo 
Jima statue made me want to see 
more of the same. He entered 
two shots of the statue, close-ups 
which made me wonder how he 
would see the rest of it. The sta
tue of the famous flag raising 
at Iwo Jima is located in Wash
ington, D.C. Its such an im
pressive, photogenic piece of 
sculpture; I remember flashing 
my bulbs off with my first cam
era, excitedly photographing the 
statue during a visit to Washing
ton, ten years ago. Bob Schwaks 
study of a Budda-like sculp
ture is simple, direct, and com
plete - a fine high-contrast shot 
of the total statue.
Being a recent student of the 
photographic art, I found myself 
more able to appreciate the var
ious technical effects and work 
of the artists in general. The use 
of high contrast usually produc
es a more graphic effect, where
as low contrast prints usually 
have a more subtle and textural 
feeling. Peter Rubensteins sea
shot, Rick Holts fire escape, 
and David Shemwells tree shots 
tended to have a graphic look  
two-dimensional, direct and bold.
Mike Adams shot of a fading 
Coca-Cola sign on the side of a 
brick building had a graphic 
feeling, utilizing not high con
trast, but simply the calligra
phic design of the words CocaCola. Exploring the sepia tech
nique, which tints the photogra
phic paper an antique brown col
or, Joel Metzger and Dave Steidl 
produced a series of prints which 
look as if they were taken right 
out of a 1910 Sears and Roe
buck catalog. Daves subjects 
were cookware utensils and 
Joels was the interior of an old 
fashioned - looking house. Both 
produced very well done exam
ples of the technique.
Adrian Tio used the photo
gram process to render two sub
tle linear photograms. (This, is a 
process which requires the use of 
a darkroom, but not a camera. 
Objects are placed on the photo
graphic paper, it is exposed to 
light, developed, and the result 
is a high contrast silhouette. The 
objects image remains as a 
white image on a black back
ground.) Adrian also used the 
Kinetic Open - lens Technique  
this is commonly referred to as 
jiggling the camera. The ef
fect is obvious, and can be used 
effectively as in Adrians exam
ple of a night city scene.
Dorothy Hershey and Tom 
Monego exhibit good composi
tion and contrast in separate 
series of architectural structure 
studies. The purity and simpli
city of Dorothys compositions 
tended towards the symmetrical, 
and contrasted greatly with her 
study of a rumpled blouse ly
ing on a floor, showing her con
trol of pure visual effect as well 
as her feeling for mood and sim
plicity. Toms prints were very 
nice, but it was hard to concen
trate on them, as they were 
mounted on a single piece of 
white board. The result was 
visually confusing, and detract
ed from the overall effect of 
each print. Harvey Kaplans 
prints were mounted in the same 
way. Another problem with pre
paring prints for this exhibition

is that they were mounted under 
glass, which catches the glare 
from the lights in the room.
On the bizzare side, Joel Met
zger, Scott Smith, and Wendy 
Brody show some solarized 
prints, and Scott also exhibits a 
grotesque shot of a charred baby 
dolls head impaled on a stick, 
bringing back memories of the 
ritualistic, animalistic slaughter 
scene in LORD OF THE FLIES 
where a pigs head is cut off and 
jammed onto a pole stuck in 
the ground. Ann Hulley has en
tered a fantastic portrait of a 
young lady in movement. The 
result is a blurred ethereal image 
with an organic grain.
I found Rick Holts and David 
Shemwells prints to be the most 
intense, photographically. David 
used the natural outdoor reality 
to his best advantage, and inter
preted his subject matter in a 
highly individualistic way. Ricks 
use of light, shade, and texture 
evoked an immediate feeling. 
His compositions of church stee
ples and interiors were highly 
inspiring.
In the back room of the Gall
ery, Chris Williams has a sort 
of one man show, a collection of 
about thirty prints. They are 
very high quality prints, each a 
separate statement in itself. 
Chris has a feeling for size, shap
ing and trimming each print to a 
size which complements the sub
ject matter perfectly. However, 
the back room his show is con
tained in is very badly ventilat
ed, and has been since the Gal
lery opened. The walls are paint
ed black, which is a fine back
ground for mounting work, but 
a fine heat absorbant also, mak
ing the room unbearably hot in 
a very short time. The Gallery 
should certainly remedy this sit
uation.
Joe Rosen had a series of eigh
ty slides on constant display in 
the hall to the back room, Aside 
from one color print by Wil
liams, Rosens work is the only 
color work in the show. From 
what I saw of the eighty, the 
color was magnificent, very nat
ural, and the slides were a plea
sant change of pace from the rest of the show, which was 
very good, overall.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
AM POD KARCS YCC Ste ARC?
None of My 
Damn Business
Editor, the TARTAN:
Permit me to reply to Warren 
Seltzers attack (TARTAN,
Feb. 11) upon my anonymous 
letter in the Feb. 4 issue.
I did not intend for my letter 
to appear without a signature. 
Blame that on the people who 
put your paper together: my sig
nature appears immediately un
der the headline Bagpiper 
(with which I never had any con
nection!) and anyone wanting to 
find out who I am may look 
there. (I see Mr. Seltzers letter 
got pretty much the same kind of 
treatmemt! For a long time 1 
thought it was anonymous until 
a friend pointed out the frag
ment on page 9.)
On the one hand, Mr. Seltzer 
writes a passionate denunciation 
of our war against the Viet
namese people including some 
incredibly maudlin passages 
about us squashing the dream 
of the Vietnamese to be free at 
last and about how he personal
ly pledges to stop napalming 
babies and gassing children. Now. 
Then on the other hand he says 
that what kind of government 
the Vietnamese get is none of 
our damn business. Does he 
care what happens to the Viet
namese, or doesnt he? There 
is a whale of a difference be
tween governmentsor has the
Left stopped caring about Greece 
and South Africa?
As for me, all that I have said 
and written on Vietnam is moti
vated by concern for the Indo
chinese. That is precisely why 
I am concerned about the ques
tion which is supposed to be 
none of my damn business. I 
even tried to hint in my letter 
the various non-self-determining 
ways in which Vietnam could 
be stuck with a dictatorship it 
does not want. If the Vietnam
ese do want a Communist govern
ment, all well and good: but let 
it come to poser as in Chile, not 
through force or double-dealing. 
Im even willing to retreat on 
this point: if I were convinced 
that a Communist takeover were 
in the best interests of Vietnam, 
I might even say sign the peace 
treaty. pull out the troops and 
planes, and may the devil take 
the hindmost. But I remain un
convinced.
Once I got past the paragraph 
about Self-Determination in 
Mr. Seltzers letter, I began to 
wonder whether he is really a 
right-winger, his letter a satire 
on the distortions the Left some
times indulges in while talking 
about Vietnam. It is increpible 
to me that anyone would seri
ously write some of that material. 
Yet I will do him the favor of 
taking his words at face value.
We are told in various ways, 
even explicitly, that the Viet
namese ARE the Vietcong be
cause they have carried on a
guerilla war for years. A gueril
la war, we are given to under
stand, cannot survive without 
the support of an overwhelming 
majority.
This popular support issue 
is an example of the inconsistency 
of the leftists. They are very 
fond of silencing flag-waving 
rightists by pointing out that the 
American revolution did not have 
the support of the majority of 
the colonists. Then they turn 
around and say the Vietnamese 
ARE the Vietcong.
If the people of Indochina are 
so overshelmingly against us, 
how is it that the government 
forces (now in the neighborhood 
of a million) have not turned 
their guns against the Americans, 
only a small fraction of whom 
are now in actual combat? Or at 
least against the puppet Sai
gon regime? How is it that Lon 
Nol has more volunteers than 
he can properly train and equip? 
Why is it that the people did
not rise up during the 1968 Tet 
offensive as the Vietcong thought 
they would?
If the Vietcong are so univer
sally loved by the people, why 
do they find it necessary to mur
der and kidnap whole villages 
full of people, bury people alive, 
shoot schoolteachers and social 
workers and medical personnel, 
disembowel men and impale 
them alive before the eyes of 
their fellow villagers (and, yes, 
burn babies and childrenand 
womento death with flame
throwers and gasoline)?
These victims are not Ameri
cans and many of them never 
even helped the Americans at 
all. Many were killed as an 
example to those who might 
be harboring unkind thoughts 
about the Vietcongexcuse me, 
I mean about the Vietnamese.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
DUBIOUSDear Editor,
Recently, ads appeared all over 
the campus for a free seminar 
being given at Duquesne Univer
sity. This seminar was described 
as dealing with Brain Program
ming and ESP. Although the ads 
did not identify the group in
volved, I have discovered that it 
is the Silva Mind Control Group, 
which has vigorously sought ac
cess to the Duquesne University 
Students. It just so happens that 
by sitting in on the free semi
nar you learn that Silva people 
teach a course which costs $200.- 
00. ($100.00 for students).
Because 1 have studied brain 
wave research techniques with 
Dr. Joe Kamiya in San Francis
co, 1 was asked by a professor 
at Duquesne to check out the 
activities of the Silva group. Be
cause some of my field research 
has included contact with differ
ent groups who are into medita
tion or mind control, 1 was 
glad to oblige. 1 can only report 
that I have considerable profes
sional reservations about the ef
fectiveness of the Silva groups 
training. They claim to teach 
their students how to control their 
alpha waves, yet they do not
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
bring in any machine to test al
pha waves  even though such de
vices are available for under 
$200.00. When I asked for any 
published studies which might 
suggest that Silva training signi
ficantly enhances alpha brain 
waves, I was told there were 
none.
There is currently much in
terest among students in the poss
ibility of controlling the alpha 
brain waves, and I am concerned 
that this interest may be turned 
into a considerable financial ad
vantage for these currently in a 
position to capitalize on student 
curiosity. This concern of mine 
is increased by the current lack 
of objective measurement which 
characterizes the Silva program. 
One further point: since a stud
ent can reduce his own fee by 
signing up others for the course, 
it is important to carefully eval
uate the claims of acquaintances 
who seem overly eager to get 
others to enroll. In spite of my 
reservations, I am trying to keep 
an open mind, and I encourage 
others to be open also  careful, 
but also open, because after all 
this IS the Age of Aquarius.
May your alpha and your hap
piness increase, james V. Hardt 
Instructor in Psychology
WAITING
Dear Editor:
On Saturday night, in Skibo, 
there was a concert with Sea
train and Don Crawford. Because 
of circumstances beyond our con
trol, many people had to wait in 
the lobby for about an hour. We 
are sincerely sorry about this in
convenience. Hopefully, our fu
ture concerts will run more 
smoothly. Thank you all for being 
so patient and understanding.
The Activities Board.
ISPRINT
The TARTAN,
I am writing to correct what 
I suppose to be a printing error 
that significantly altered the sub
stance of a letter I wrote you last 
week. It was the letter you en
titled, Fenced. I said that I 
went out to paint the fence on 
Monday because Gulf Oil was 
recruiting on campus Tuesday. 
Tuesday was incorrectly printed 
as Thursday.
Chris Thein
The TARTAN is gladly accepting applications for next year's staff. All positions are open. 
Applications should include whatever qualifications or fantastic ideas you might have.
Enthusiasm, without a doubt, is a suitable substitute for experience.
Our staff structure is very flexible, so you need not apply for a specific post. You should, 
however, indicate the general area in which you would like to work: News, Features, or 
Sports Writing, Business Staff, Layout Staff, Photography Staff, or Copy Staff (typing and 
proof reading). For all positions you can be trained ON THE JOB. By no means are you lim
ited to working in only one field.
Please send applications to the Editor-In-Chief, TARTAN, Skibo 50. Include your ad
dress so that we may get in touch with you.
The new staff will start work after the spring recess.

Joe Clarke, a teacher of 
Transcendental Meditation 
who studied at the Interna
tional Academy of Medita
tion in Rishikesh, India with 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, will 
speak about Transcendental 
Meditation Wednesday, March
3, in the Student Union Ball
room of the University of 
Pittsburgh at 8:30 P.M. He 
will discuss the value of 
practicing Transcendental 
Meditation for the individual 
in terms of development
of full mental potential, and 
its implications for social be
havior, world peace and edu
cation.
Tens of thousands of stu
dents on most of the major 
campuses throughout the
country have begun practic
ing the technique within the 
past few years. It is offer
ed by the Students' Interna
tional Meditation Society, a 
non-profit organization, which 
is the fastest growing student 
movement in the country.
The sole purpose of S.I.M.S. 
is to help every individual 
expand his mind, develop his 
creative intelligence and 
make use of his full potential 
in studies, career and recrea
tion. This purpose is fullfilled 
through the practice of T.M. 
which is neither a religion 
nor a way of life, but rather 
a scientific, mechanical tech
nique which produces effects 
from the very beginning.
Following the lecture a sec
ond meeting will be schedul
ed at which time a qualified 
teacher of T.M. will discuss 
the basic mechanics of the 
technique. Individual in
struction will then be avail
able for those interested.

Pag 10THE T ART ANThursday, February 25, 1971Editorial
Writing these Thursday sermons is really a chore some
times. Late at night (early in the morning) you have some 
wierd thoughts, but usually they dont pan out. So you think 
about what to write, running through the approaches: another 
denouncement of the war, a didactic piece on educational 
reform, teeing off on something that bugged you this week, 
one more call to action; you end up wondering if anyone 
is out there. Is anyone there? Who reads this crud anyway? 
Is everyone here bent on treating this place as a stepping 
stone to M.I.T. or Caltech? Does anyone view this place as 
anything but an academic automat? Does anyone around here 
have a sense of community?
Well, anyway you end up late at night (early in the morn
ing) just wanting to write something pleasant, to make peo
ple happy, maybe. A tall order, in Pittsburgh in the winter.
So maybe you can tell a little story, and everyone you 
can think of either cant be printed (yet), or makes you a 
racist, elitist, male chauvinist pig, imperialist, culture vulture, 
corrupt degenerate, reactionary, raving radical, or cretin. So 
forget it.
So what would all those readers (all 10 or 12 of them) 
like to read? Do they like to read? Of course not, you linear 
fool. So how about a nice picture?.

---------------------------------------------------

23 T3 0> 5/ IS INNOCENCE DEAD?
If innocence exists at all in any
one living today who is past the 
age of reason it exists with the 
help of a special type of larceny. 
This larceny may sometimes be 
destructive, but it is the quality 
needed to repel those forces 
which make a practice of destroy
ing the innocent. Without this pro
tective quality there is no inno
cence. Without it there can be no 
dreams for when innocence is dis
covered, and the plans which it 
has formulated are exposed to 
critical examination, then deri
sion, skepticism, and advantagetaking all begin waiting for their 
opportunity to prey upon what 
they have lost, the ability to ex
perience and appreciate. Perhaps 
this is one of the things wrong 
with society todaythere is far 
too little room for innocence and 
dreams. The world is too much 
with us, and as a result we are 
losing the ability to escape from 
reality without the aid of mind 
expanders or something to alter 
our perceptions of what is go
ing on around us.
Brewster McCloud concerns one 
individual who still retains his in
nocence and ability to dream (by 
merest coincidence the individ
uals name is also Brewster Mc
Cloudisnt it fascinating how 
Hollywood manages to do things 
like that?). His dream is to be 
able to fly like a bird, and it is to 
this end that Brewster devotes al
most all of his existence. Unfortu
nately, he is not left alone to pur
sue his goals, for he must also see 
to it that the society in which he exists is not given the chance to 
prey upon either him or his 
dreams.
Safeguarding Brewster seems 
to be the job of the mysterious 
Louise and her raven. Whenever 
Brewster appears to be getting 
into a situation where he is about 
to fall into the hands of those who 
would harm or exploit him, she 
intervenes to save him. All that 
Louise asks of Brewster is that he 
maintain his innocence and that he 
keep his plans to fly a secret. 
Louis is omnipresent whenever 
Brewster needs her and she ap
pears ready to do anything to help 
him, even to the extent of strang
ling anyone who stands in his way.
Bud Cort, the orderly from 
M*A*S*H, plays Brewster and
makes him entirely believable.
________ di___________
by TERENCE N. PALSO
Never once does Corts expres
sion or actions even suggest that 
he is putting the audience on. In
stead, he creates the characteriz
ation of a thorougly dedicated 
young man who is determined to 
pursue his dream to its realiza
tion.
Sally Kellerman, M*A*S*Hs 
Hot Lips, portrays Louise, the 
mysterious woman who is always 
around when Brewster gets into 
trouble. Whether or not she is re
sponsible for the stranglings 
which seem to follow Brewster 
around is unexplained, but a hint 
is given to the audience when they 
are shown the scars on her back 
which seem to have been made by 
the removal of a pair of wings. 
Although she is given relatively 
few lines, Miss Kellerman cer
tainly makes the most of her part by succeeding in adding an air of 
mysterious ambiguity to the pro
ceedings.
Perhaps the lions share of the 
credit should go to screenwriter 
Doran William Cannon and to di
rector Robert Altman. Unfortun
ately Cannons contribution to the 
film has been somewhat obscur
ed due to a recent article in the 
Sunday New York Times in which 
he accused Altman of doing con
siderable alterations on his work. 
Be this at it may, the screenplay 
which happened to be filmed is 
richly imaginative. Even while it 
may contain a specific message to 
convey to its audience, the screen
play for BREWSTER McCLOUD 
also contains a great many topic
al jokes, irreverent asides, and 
even a spoof of the film BULLITT. 
In fact, the screenplay is so rich 
that undoubtedly more meaning 
and understanding can be derived 
from repeated viewings of the 
film.
Robert Altman, who also di
rected M*A*S*H, has succeed
ed once again with BREWSTER 
McCLOUD. This latest film is 
even more of a challenge than its 
predecessor in that it goes deep
er into its subject while possess
ing a far more complicated plot 
line. Altman not only succees in 
bringing the screenplay to life, 
he makes it work. It is one thing 
to tell a joke, and quite another 
to tell a joke and get laughs. Altman has mastered the technique 
of doing both with skill and fi
nesse. His great eye and feeling
for comedy successfully brings 
off the satire of BULLITT with
out doing any harm to the central 
story. Altmans work also con
tains little vignetes and sight gags 
which are pure mastery. From 
the opening shot of the MGM lion 
which doesnt growl but instead 
says, Ive forgotten the words, 
to the final mind-boggling scene, 
Altmans film never becomes so 
concerned with what it is saying 
that it cant take time out to poke 
fun at something.
BREWSTER McCLOUD, up to 
its final scene, takes very little 
seriously, not even itself. Then, 
suddenly, its final shot jarrs the 
audience by telling them that 
what they have been laughing 
through is not really funnyits 
actually very tragic. Looked at 
from various angles, BREWS
TER McCLOUD is no more about 
a young man who wants to fly than 
BLOW-UP is about a fashion 
photographer who lost some pic
tures.
Fortunately Altman and Cannon 
did not make a carthritic film  
one of those vehicles which 
shocks and drains its audience 
while beating it over the head with 
its message. Even their final 
scene which is startling does not 
serve to provoke profound emo
tion, but rather clarifies and fo
cuses attention on what has gone 
on before.
Dreams and innocence are cor
rupted or so wounded by society 
that they cannot exist for very 
long without protection. In 
BREWSTER McCLOUD they are 
protected, but alas even this is 
not enough for as painful as it is 
to watch dreams become shat
tered and innocence become lost, 
it is indeed far more horrible to 
finally attain ones dreams only 
to realize that they do not bring 
fulfillment and happiness for very 
long. When a person achieves his 
wildest notions and realizes his 
daydreams, he is left with no 
place to go and nothing to strive 
for. He cannot even retreat into 
fantasy for he has been living 
there. It is then that reality closes 
in, and this may prove to be far 
too great a shock to bear. It is no 
wonder that Cannon and Altman 
presented their film in a comic 
fashion. Had they chosen any 
other means the result might have been too much for anyone to take.

W>i'OKlAL
Bv STORK
As all C-MU students know, or should know, there are no athletic 
scholarships offered to any athlete at C-MU. This has resulted in medi
ocre intercollegiate varsity competition. There are perhaps three pos
sible programs to follow within the present system which could result
in improved teams.
The first and probably easiest program involves scheduling 
teams with the same attitude towards sports as C-MU. Coach Jim 
Brown has managed to get MIT on his basketball schedule in two years 
and is trying to get the University of Chicago for next year. There is 
also talk of organizing a holiday tournament to take up the mid-season 
30 day slack at the end of the first semester. These steps will hopefully 
carry over the other sports.
The second program is a more dramatic step which, by its very 
name, immediately turns off the money-conscious administrators. Im 
referring to a full-or part-time recruiter, whose job would be to seek out 
the academic student who is also a good athlete. The 1965-66 basket
ball team proved you dont have to sacrifice anything academically to 
obtain athletic achievements. The 1965-66 team had a season record 
of 16-6 for the best ever in the history of CIT/C-MU while still main
taining a very high academic standard. Each of the starters on that 
winning team had a cumulative factor above 3.0. In all probability that 
team was not recruited, but happened by chance. Im suggesting that a 
recruiter could insure such teams in all sports in the future.
The third and undoubtedly the hardest program is instituting in
centive into the unmotivated potential varsity athletes on campus. We 
all know someone who could be a big help to a varsity team and would 
like to play but says, Im not interested. This program would be most 
useful if it was student organized.
C-MU is unique in that all the various colleges that make up the 
university very seldom come together for any event. About the only 
thing going now as common ground is Spring Carnival. Since varsity 
competition is recreation for the spectator and thus draws a parallel to 
Spring Carnival, Id like to see varsity sports become a year round com
mon ground for all the various university constituencies. This wont 
happen, however, until the level of varsity competition is improved.
PITT WINS AGAIN
STORKS
SPORTS
rgi-jwry, iv.,,.TO-7 ^07-1-,M
The C-MU Hockey Club played 
host to the newest team in area 
college hockey, the Pitt Panth
ers, at the Alpine Ice Chalet last 
Sunday, about 200 fans, mostly 
from Pitt, were on hand to wit
ness the game. However, the CMU club followed the usual path 
of Carnegie-Mellon teams in the 
local sports rivalry as they 
were drowned by Pitt, 8-1. It was 
the first interscholastic game for 
the talented and heavily manned 
Pitt squad:
Pitt lacked team work in their 
attack, but was able to rely on the 
individual efforts of a few of their 
better players, each of three play
ers scoring two goals. The Pan
thers got two in the first period, 
added three more in the seccnd, 
and tacked on another three in 
the final period.
For C-MU it became a frustrat
ing contest. They were able to get 
the puck into the Pitt zone on 
many occasions, but managed 
very few shots on goal. C-MUs 
only score came in the second 
period when Russ Wescoe took a 
pass from line-mate Boo Dewey 
and tucked in his own rebound, 
after the Pitt goaltender kicked 
out his back-handed shot.
The sheering fans aroused the 
players to a game of body-check
ing, which then, of course, led to 
a barrage of penalties, Pitt was 
assessed to 10 minor penalties for 
such offenses as: tripping, cross
checking, hich-sticking, roughing, 
holding and charging. C-MU col
lected five, for similar play.
Pitt found little difficulty in 
penetrating the C-MU end to ma
chine-gun C-MUs overworked

In spite of the score, Hart had 
to be, without a doubt, the out
standing performer for either 
side. Jeff halted dozens of Pitt 
drives with brilliant stops. The 
C-MU freshman goalie also gath
ered several ovations from the 
Pitt fans as well as his bundle of 
saves.
C-MU is now 3-3-0; next game 
is with Indiana of Pennsylvania 
this Sunday on their ice. C-MU 
defeated Indiana at home last 
month, 7-3.
WRESTLING
Last Friday the Tartan wrest
lers demonstrated clear improve
ment as they lost to Grove City, 
31-13. George Wargo was impres
sive at 118 as he completely dom
inated the match. After his first 
period double-leg takedown, 
George was looking for a half
nelson or a chicken-wing to turn 
the opponent over for the pin. The 
Grove City man was good at lying 
on his stomach, so George just 
built up over six minutes of riding 
time throughout the rest of the 
match. At 126, Monte Ishije won 
by forfeit. After leading 4-0, Allen 
Kohan (134) was reversed as he 
got too high trying to put in a cra
dle. The figure four around the 
waist was then used by Grove City 
throughout the rest of the match, 
and Kohan had trouble getting out 
of it, eventually losing, 7-4. At 142, 
Bruce Turkal, a recent recruit, 
lost by default.
Wrestling at 150, Pete Kelston 
lost his match, 9-7. Pete executed 
a nice single-leg takedown and 
two reversals, but he was riding 
too high and was reversed by 
Grove City several times. Joe 
Stoub lost by a fall at 158 and Vic 
Rogers won by forgeit at 167. The 
last two matches were forfeited 
to Grove City.
The entire team showed better 
moves and more confidence in 
their wrestling. The team 
wrestles the California JVs Tues
day. This is a really excellent

THE BEGINNING OF THE END
Although C-MU dropped out of 
the Presidents Athletic Confer
ence seven years ago, they have 
continued to complete on an even 
level with most of its members. 
Last Wednesday, the Tartans de
feated PAC leader Allegheny, 77- 
69, for their sixth victory of the 
season. Gene Turner regained his 
early season scoring touch to lead 
Tech with 32 points.
Like a number of the Tartan 
contests this season, the score 
was close throughout with the 
C-MU squad leading at the half, 
34-33. Allegheny had a 67 for
ward who was an inch shorter 
than 66 Frank Sacco, however, 
it was Gator forward Doug Trenkle who was doing the most dam
age for the opposition. One of the 
first half highlights was an Alle
gheny pass to C-MU Assistant 
Coach Rich Mullins (of Old Men 
fame) who was caught by sur
prise on the Tartan bench.
The second half saw Allegheny 
begin to pull away then the Tar
tans staged their patented come
back.
They tied the score at 65 with 
nearly four minutes remaining in 
the game. Kevin Cotter hit a set 
shot to put C-MU ahead, 71-69; 
then Gene Turner tapped in a re
bound for a four point lead with 
48 seconds left. Allegheny failed 
to score once more and, when Von 
Lindern missed a free throw, Sac
co tapped it in for two more points 
to wrap up the contest. Eddie Aul 
played a solid game for Tech and 
scored 14 points to aid the win
ning effort.
team, but the grapplers hope to 
come away with added experi
ence, so they can put on a winning 
performance against Bethany on 
Saturday and vs. Gannon, the last 
meet of the season, the following 
Thursday.
Pitt came to the C-MU gym 
Saturday for their final basketball 
game against the Tartans, ending 
a 57-year series. As usual, the 
gym was packed since CarnegiePitt games seem to bring out the 
latent school spirit in us all.
The game started out with a 
quick exchange of baskets with 
Frank Sacco scoring most of the 
C-MU points and Kent Scott re
fusing to miss a shot for the Pan
thers. When Pitt Coach Buzz Ridle 
called for a time out with his 
team hanging on to a 23-18 lead, 
the Tartan fans were satisfied 
that the home team was giving 
Pitt a formidable battle.
At this point, the Panthers 
turned on their defense and 
C-MU offense was tuned out for 
the next ten minutes. A quick 
glance at the scoreboard near the 
end of the half showed that Pitt 
had run off 25 straight points to 
damp out the Tech enthusiasm in 
a hurry. Kent Scott connected on 
10 of 11 jump shots to score 21 
pointsnot bad for less than a 
half-afternoon of work.
The game might have been over 
but the second half still had some 
interesting moments. Part one 
was Igor vs. the world. Von Lin
dern not only set a Tech record 
for drawing charging fouls in the 
game, but also left his mark on 
Pitts Steve Lewis (among 
others). Part two featured Jeff 
Hollis driving, twisting layups 
through the entire Panther de
fense-even Buzz Ridl seemed 
impressed with Jeffs desire. And 
part three can be entitled, Can 
Rodney Schoon and Jim Twesrdy 
boost their scoring averages?
The final score was Pitt 104, 
C-MU 59but well still miss 
these games in future years.
