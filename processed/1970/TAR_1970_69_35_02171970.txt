Vol 69, No.3 5C-MUTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1970
Security Increased; 
Changes Planned
In response lo concern expressed editorially in the Tartan 
and in various letters submitted by individuals and groups of students. 
Dr. Stever requested Messrs. Kibbee. Thomas and Swank to devise 
methods ot increasing the effectiveness ol secutity coverage on the 
campus. The tollowing steps have been taken thus far:
1. Physical Plant has checked and repaired all light fixtures and 
devices on campus and has increased by approximately 50 the output 
ol all fixtures capable of being increased.
2. The City ol Pittsburgh was requested to and has supplied addit
ional lighting on Morewood Avenue between Forbes and Fifth Avenues.
3. In response to reports of outrages in the central campus area. 
Physical Plant, on Friday. February 6. checked and repaired all 
control mechanisms and replaced inoperative timing controls which 
were responsible tor the outage of one set of lights on the cut.
4. Physical Plant has also been instructed to prepare estimates 
of the cost of additional lighting ot the following kinds:
a. campus floodlights
b. increased output trom present mercury vapor lights.
Those estimates should be available tor review early in the week of 
February 16.
City fire engines were called to Scaife Hall Friday night (See Editorial, page two).
Faculty Senate Discusses Discipline
In addition, the committee named above has been concerned about 
wavs to increase the numbers of security men available for patrol at 
the times of greatest need. In order to do this the committee has re
quested Director Young to provide them with a study of potential ways 
to increase the numbers ot present security personnel on campus dur
ing the hours between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. and they have also asked Direc
tor Young to review methods ot i eleasmg security personnel from non
patrol activities, perhaps by the substitution of other personnel to 
fulfill those functions.
Debates Proposed Changes in CIT
Bv PAMELA HORNER
The main business of the Faculty Senate meeting 
last Tuesday afternoon consisted of a summary of 
the faculty position on a campus code and an ex
planation by President Stever to CIT and Mellon 
Institute of the administration's intentions in the 
proposed reorganization of science and engineering.
Professor Langer. chairman of the faculty, 
briefly summarized the executive committee posi
tion on a campus code. The committee recognized 
the need to up-date the current undergraduate code 
prescribing behavior, but they felt it was not in the 
best interest of the faculty to involve itself in this 
activity. The tacultv believes that, at present, constiaints ot civil law and the commitment 10 profes
sional standards implicit in contractual obligations 
to the University are adequate to guarantee the 
faculty's accountability. They view any further reg
ulations as dangerous to academic freedom by al
lowing the growth of a mechanism of repression.
President Stever answered questions and gave 
reassurances concerning his proposed reorgani
zation of Science and Engineering between CIT 
and Mellon Institute. He stated that the merger ol 
the two schools had not been as clear or as complete 
as first hoped. By reorganizing, he desires to prov
ide people at Mellon with a clear view of their 
tuture and to spread UniversiU resources. He sees 
a long, hard struggle ahead for resources to fund the 
research that C-MU must continue to develop. One 
benefit of the proposed reorganization.as he sees 
it. is that it will strengthen individual departments 
attempts to build the bridges to the outside world 
that strengthen the Universitys ability to find the 
necessai v resoui ces.
The faculty was mainly concerned about the 
criteria used to separate the departments within 
each school, fearing a destruction of the mter-disciplinary work now in existence. President Stever 
leassured them that he wanted more channels for 
inter-department activity and not the destruction 
of those that already exist.
He also reassured both CIT and Mellon that each 
voice would be heard and considered equally, and 
that neither would be submerged in the reorgani
zation.
Professor Langer reported on the activities ot 
Vice-Pres. Strathmeyer. Business Affairs, and the 
Committee of Nine and then efforts concerning 
discrimination in construction unions. The commit
tee has been investigating the possibility of con
certed action among the Pittsburgh universities 
to determine compliance with federal policies ot 
non-diserimination and action that can be taken it 
a violation is discovered in a union working on a 
university contract. They are also discussing inter
nal employment practices within a university.
The faculty recognized the efforts of V-P 
Strathmeyei and the Committee and approved ot 
the action they have taken tollowing the Faculty 
Senate recommendation last fall.
Professoi Langei also announced that there will 
be an open Student Senate meeting Tuesday atternoon to which the Facultv Senate had been invited, 
lie urged them to attend to hear Jot* Duckworth s 
Slate ot the Univeisity address and the discussion 
ot the campus code.

As additional decisions aie made, the committee has planned to 
keep the campus community informed. They urge, however, that mcceased lighting and increased patrol alone will not permit students 
to neglect their own personal safety. All campus personnel has been 
urged to lock doors in rooms and buildings when they are not in use 
The committee particularly urges that women avoid traveling campus 
areas late at night without escorts.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOREditorial
Arson?"Tribute": Excellent Waste of Time and Effort
The same time. The same place. For the past two Fri
day nights at approximately midnight three city fire en
gines have been called to Scaife Hall. Last week the call 
was made in response to a burning bulletin board on the 
second floor. This week a fire was reported in the base
ment.
It seems to us that these events cannot be regarded as 
mere coincidence. Someone, on or off campus, either has an 
intense dislike of computers or a burning fondness for fire.
We recommend that a security patrolman be assigned 
to night duty at the computation center to prevent any furth
er attempts. Future damage could be much more extensive.
A Challenge
Elections. Time to evaluate whether or not Student Gov
ernment has been effective and responsive to students needs 
and interests. Student Government has made great progress 
in the past two years in obtaining a voice for students at all 
levels of the decision-making process. It has won control 
over a vast sum of student funds. It is time to take stock, to 
determine direction, to make sure that the senate will move 
forward.
Those senators who are up for re-election must deter
mine whether their presence on the Senate has been irres
ponsible or effective. Those who have been exhibiting the 
ho-hum attitude, those who have been more committed 
to adjournment than to devoting a proper amount of time to 
motions, those who have voted for who rather than for 
what, must make the decision to bow gracefully out of the 
race. Student Senate is no longer a game of high school stu
dent council with mock responsibilities and power.
It is also time for those Senators who have acted respon
sibly, taking into consideration the wishes of their constitu
encies, to make the decision to run for re-election. It is time 
for those outside SG, some of whom may be cynical to decide 
that they must do something about the situation. The Senate 
needs fresh ideas and new people.
Several members of this year's Senate have acted in 
good faith, taking the proper time to consider the effects 
and implications of the motions brought before them, rath
er than acting frivolously and irresponsibly. Among those 
senators are; David Adler, present Chairman of the Finance 
Committee, Scott Miller, Bill Iacono, Frank Puschak, Carter 
Allen, Sue Cattano and Ken Friend. These representatives 
have done their homework and have considered their respon
sibilities to be more than simply a couple of hours Tuesday 
afternoons. We commend them and urge them to run for reelection (if they are not graduating.)
Student Senate has taken many steps forward. It would 
be terribly unfortunate if these progressive strides were re
versed because of irresponsible and unimaginative leader
ship and membership.
This afternoon at 4:00 in the Skibo Ballroom Joe Duck
worth, President of Student Government, will address the 
University community. He will present his views, explain
ing which of the Senates motions have been carried to frui
tion and which have been left by the wayside.
For those who are presently considering whether or not to 
run for Student Government office, this speech will be of the ut
most importance. For only when we know where we have 
been can we decide where we will go.
The challenge is open ... for the takers.

Editor. The Tartan:
A very interesting series, A Tribute to Ex

An excellent waste of time and effort, While 
student interviewers valiantly strive to acknow
ledge good teaching, at least some of the faculty 
interviewed recognized the rub  good teaching 
really doesn't count for much when a job is at 
stake.
In my department, the most efficient and 
elequent teaching evaluation I have yet seen was 
conducted for an instructor (delicate sensitivity 
prevents me from naming the victim of the hasty 
decision) who was informed that he was not rehired (the popular term, however unfair, is 
 fired  there is a^ slight semantic difference. 
Students and faculty wrote letters to the Dean 
asking for reconsideration of the matter, in view
of the man's demonstrated excellence in his field 
and in the classroom. A single petition, available 
for only one day before finals, was sent to the 
Dean with nearly 100 signatures in protest of the 
action. None of the "student input was acknow
ledged. As Professor Demarest said, perhaps pro
phetically. . . if they don t have the PhD in 
hand, they are fired. That's the rub.
...I admire the naive idealism ot the students 
who wrote these articles. However, until the stu
dents insist upon a review and revamping oi 
the current procedures for hirings firing, promo

teachers be retained, we will continue to be

History Lounge Opens; 
Unique Setting for Talk
By CHUCK DALY
The History Department Lounge, located at Baker Hall 254C, 
opened for the first time on February 11 at 2:00 P.M. A large sub
scription was maintained until closing time at 5:00 P.M. as the vis
itors enjoyed the opportunity to converse with fellow historians. Re
freshments were available at no cost, although in the future a 
small donation will be asked.
The development of the lounge was funded bv a University 
grant, given with the stipulation that the money be spent by an 
interior decorator. The chic furnishings of the lounge reflect this 
stylish orange and blue fabric swivel chairs that are arranged 
around tables similar to those used in the Tartan Grill.
Hanging on the walls are several prints done by C-MU art 
majors. The Lounge Committee hopes to make arrangements with 
the College of Fine Arts by which student work would be exhibit
ed in the future on a rotating basis.

99Artichoke Theatres "Naga Uta 
Just Manages To Be Acceptable
BILL PHILLIPS
If you were one of the scant 
fifteen or so people who won
dered into the opening night of 
the Artichoke s "Naga Uta" you 
may have found the evening 
interesting, but if you stayed 
home last Thursday night as the 
majority of Pittsburgh did. you 
didn't miss much either. Arti
choke's playwright, director and 
founder. Dick Reichman seeks 
an intimate, relaxed theatre 
where people can feel at ease. 
The entire acting-audience area 
is surrounded in a womb of bur
lap, and the audience is invited 
to sit in little clumps on the 
floor and take their shoes off. 
Well, the evening was relaxed, 
in spite of the fact that most of 
the brave fifteen kept their 
shoes on. What was missing on 
opening night was any sense of 
excitement. The plays were sup
posed to be collages of sights 
and sounds, but they never got 
going because this mass collec
tion was rarely shaped towards 
one emotional impact.$a
This lack of direction and con
centrated emotion was not help
ed bv the actors either, as most
seemed to be rejects from those 
high school plays you remem
ber too well. There were a few 
good moments turned in by the 
black king, the blond beauty, 
and the tall cretin woman, but 
these were exceptions. The set 
did show signs of interest, as de
signer Ted Roth put together an 
abstract, impressionistic series 
of interconnecting ropes and 
bare wooden structures which 
delighted the imagination, but 
they tailed to be significantly 
connected with the action of 
the play.
As toi the meaning of the 
plays or the lack of it. the ev
ening started off with a fifteen 
minute piece called "City". 
The action consisted of two peo
ple sitting on an abstract repre
sentation of someone s small 
downtown apartment, dully go
ing through a variety ot chores 
such as playing cards, smoking 
a cigar, and rocking in a chair. 
In contrast to this drabness, 
Reichman attempts to capture 
the inner tensions of these two 
people by using a tape record
ing of noises, sounds, and words. 
Against a steady cacaphony of
city sounds, we hear the variety 
of things that go through then 
heads. Sometimes we hear 
groans, unexplained laughter, 
trivial observations, and the 
screams of recollected pain. She 
remembers the only time he 
dared to hurt her. when he kick
ed her in the stomach. As we 
eavesdrop we find that she worlted about why he doesn t visit 
her. while is is conscious only 
of their few good sexual exper
iences  when her nails clawed 
into his back. The dreary drone 
of street noises, the languid phy
sical inactivity of the actors, and 
the contrast in the consciousness 
of their two minds tells us that 
these two people are very much 
alone. They sit in their separate 
apartments, existentially alone, 
waiting for something to happen. 
But while the playwright had 
good intentions in this ten min
ute exercise, the audience ends 
up waiting longer than the ac
tors. Although the intent is 
clear, the play lacks the depth 
and inner anguish to become 
truly involving.
After this short piece and a 
ten minute intermission in
which nobody goes to the lob
by (after all. they just got 
there , the second play. "Naga 
Uta". begins. Although the title 
lemains contusing from the be
ginning to the end. it seems as 
if the second play is also talk
ing about the dull loneliness of 
people s lives. But while the 
themes may be the same, the 
techniques are not: "Naga Uta" 
is more decidedly a series of 
images. Throughout the play six 
people talk, often at the same 
time, but rarely about the same 
thing. They ramble on and on 
about the trivial, sometimes im
portant. concerns of their lives, 
and the relationships between 
the characters never become 
clear, as they appear to be 
blindly babbling out of their 
own inner anxieties. What the 
play writer has provided for us 
is a collage of sounds. Through 
the inner and sometimes collec
tive rhythms of the speeches we 
are expected not to understand, 
but to teel the inner plight of 
these people.
Ignoring the obnoxious "boo

An Atmosphere of To
Co-Ed residents share a chair during a Town Meeting.
Photo by RIC WERME
Ninety percent ot the present 
residents of Welch Hall intend 
to return next year. They unani
mously feel that the oniy other 
alternative now is moving into 
an apartment. No one wants to 
go back to the Men's dorms or 
Morewood. They feel so enthusi
astic about co-ed housing, in tact 
that they are encouraging 
the Administration to provide 
additional dorm space next year 
foi others who would like to try 
it. as well as for those who were 
waiting-listed last year because 
of lack of space. The Welchites 
have therefore prepared evalu
ation ot the project which they 
hope will be considered by the 
Administration. Exerptsfollow:
By JENIFER DIGBY
This story has been a long 
time in the making. It all start
ed one afternoon last fall when 
Tartan photographer Jerry Sis
kind and I went knocking on 
doors at Welch Hall. We d heard 
that a Co-Educational Dormi
tory had been set up there and 
we wanted to see it in opera
tion. Jerry and I were looking 
for comments from the resi
dents about how the project was 
working, whether there were 
any problems, how the Admin
istration regarded the Co-Ed 
dorm, and so on.
That afternoon there were 
only a handful of students at 
home, however, so Jerry took a 
few pictures and I made plans
to come back. Later that month 
I attended a Town Meeting 
and stayed overnight with two 
of the residents.
A "Town Meeting" at Welch 
Hall, is co-ed's answer to what 
is known elsewhere on campus 
as the Dorm Meeting. The. dif
ference is that Town Meetings 
involve the entire population of 
male-female residents. Town 
meetings are also more casual 
and no doubt a great deal more 
lively than the average dorm 
meeting. Topics dealth with 
encompass features and pro
blems unique to the co-ed situ
ation: Should Welch residents
have keys to the front door, and 
should the door be locked at 
night to provide added protecMurray Spiegel and Rob Linsenmeier conduct a Town Meeting.

tion since there are girls living 
here? Shouldn't we buy a re
frigerator (or two so that peo
ple off-contract can store food? 
How about having coke and soft 
drinks brought in? (Something 
few other dorms have done 
successfully.* Why don't we 
adopt a foster child in Asia? 
Lets have another coffee house. 
How can we spread the word to 
the rest of the campus commun
ity that Co-Ed Housing is alive 
and well?
Welch Hall certainly is differ
ent. On the two occasions that I 
stayed there, once last fall and 
once again last month to re
fresh my memory, the students 
there repeatedly let me know 
that privacy was available to
those who wanted it. In other 
words, one could interact, or one 
could go on just as in any other 
dorm system. Just because it's 
co-ed. one does not have to be 
with the group 24 hours a day.
The residents do tend to spend 
a lot of time together. They of
ten eat together, study together, 
do the laundry together, etc. Al
most any evening, if a resident 
is in need of a little fellowship, 
he can find a group assembled 
in the hall to study, talk, eat 
crackers, show off the latest re
sults of a photography lesson, 
share Murray's sound system 
via head phones, listen to Walt's 
guitar, or puzzle over somebody 
else s jigsaw.

it proves the dorm to be suc
cessful even if all of the origin
al proposals have not been car
ried out to the letter.
"Most of us would like to re
main in a co-ed dorm for other 
reasons as well. The fact that 
Welch Hall has had no damage 
to rugs, furniture, telephones 
or walls makes it a more attrac
tive place to live. Thus from 
a purely economic standpoint 
Welch Hall has payed off. We 
have had no water battles, fire
crackers, or any of the other 
pranks common to men's dorms. 
The reason for this must go be
yond the character of individ
ual residents and extend to the 
relationship to members of the 
opposite sex which prompts 
pride, self-respect, and matur
ity.
Because of our experiences 
we are now equipped to make a 
few suggestions on the status of 
co-ed living at C-MU in the fu
ture. First, and most important,
Dorm Counsillor Michelle Berger talks with Mr. Blue, Chief of Maintenance, outside Welch Hall.

' The residents of Welch Hall 
would like to thank the admin
istration for making the co-ed 
dorm a reality. Since the year is 
half over we can now present 
a general evaluation and a few 
suggestions for the coming 
years.
"We believe that the basic 
purpose of co-ed housing has 
been achieved. The proposal 
submitted by pDs and AWS 
stated, in part. "The casual 
presence of the opposite sex in 
living quarters will put basic 
desires into proper perspective 
and moderate the tensions and 
self-consciousness existing on 
dates. Relationships derived 
from co-educational dormitories 
will become more sincere and 
meaningful as the resident de
velops a better understanding 
of himself and the people around 
him. The earlier co-ed propos
al had a similar goal: "The total 
result will be a better, more 
meaningful, more useful social 
environment.'' This has to be 
the case. On at least one floor 
students from every college can 
be found almost nightly engaged in group studying or in
formal conversation. We have 
discovered that in social events 
spontaneity has become much 
more important than planning. 
Groups have often been formed 
of the spur of the moment to 
attend a play or a coffeehouse, 
and at least one intramural team 
has represented Welch Hall. 
Even in something as ordinary 
as watching television or eating 
dinner, the residents tend to 
act together. Possibly because of 
the reasons outlined in the pro
posal, there is a spirit of belong
ing and a certain pride in Welch 
that can be found in no other 
dorm on campus. Further exam
ples of this unity that exists here 
are pooling of our resources to 
buy refrigerators, and the inves
tigation into the possibility of 
sponsering a foster child. These 
are the concrete things which 
show the success of the experi
ment. but around them there is 
a certain atmosphere in Welch 
is hard for anyone except a resi
dent to appreciate. Those mak
ing decisions on the future of 
co-ed housing should not neglect 
this intangible atmosphere, for

is to continue and expand co-ed 
housing next year. Looking be
yond this, we strongly urge that 
the new dormitories be at least 
partially co-educational in the 
same sense that Welch is. The 
only changes necessary, al
though these should not rule out 
other possibilities, are more 
cooking and living facilities.
"A second suggestion is to pro
vide for some faculty housing in 
the new dorms. Since we have 
found that counselors are unnec
essary in Welch, the faculty 
would in no way be supervisory, 
but they would contribute to an 
extended learning experience.
The evaluation has been fair
ly brief and general, so further 
comments from individual parti
cipants may be forthcoming. We 
hope that this statement will at 
least provide an idea of our sen
timents and help to determine 
the policies for the future of co
ed housing.

In the last of a series within a 
series, Frank N. Hawkins, editor 
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 
spoke to the Ys Thursday Noon 
Forum about A Newspapers Re
sponsibility to the Community.
Mr. Hawkins outlined what he 
felt were the four functions of a 
newspaper: to inform the reader 
as fully and accurately as possi
ble, to entertain through comic 
strips and special features, to in
fluence public opinion, and to pro
vide a commercial service with 
advertisements.
The Post-Gazette has 125 col
umns of non-advertising space. 
These are allocated on a depart
ment basis leaving 40 columns of 
news-holes to be filled with in
ternational, national, state, re
gional, and local news. The two 
main sources of this news are the 
wire services and the reportorial staff. More news is received 
than column^space allows print
ing, and the days work involves 
much editing of the news to gather 
what is interesting and useful to 
the reader.
Editorials are written daily. 
These are directly-voiced opin
ions of the editorial staff about 
events they view strongly and the 
only time the paper attends to in
fluence public opinion. Feedback 
on these issues is received daily in 
the letters to the editor. -
Nothing is more perishable 
than the news; everyday is a new 
day. Mr. Hawkins further stated
that the newspapers have a strong 
sense of their limitations of time 
and space and they do their best 
within these bounds. Decisions are 
made daily about what news is 
printed based on what is neces
sary to inform the public.
One question asked Mr. Hawk
ins concerned the recent attempts 
to subpoena the records of report
ers. Mr. Hawkins replied that he 
felt it was a dangerous and un
called-for move. If the police want 
information, they should gather 
it themselves instead of asking 
the press to spy for them. Mr. 
Hawkins also said that he was 
against any government activ
ity that encroaches on the free
dom of the press. He felt that as 
a public institution under constant 
public survelliance, the presses 
had sufficient limits set on its 
power.
I like to think of a newspaper 
as an institution. People come 
and go, but the newspaper, I like 
to think, goes on.'

Sex Information Forum
Tuesday, February 17, 1970 THE TARTANPage 7
Recently a group of third-year 
medical students from the UmverSy of Pittsburgh have formed a
laker's bureau-the Medical
Sent Sex Information Forum.
The purpose of the organization 
is two-fold: to provide authorita
tive information in the area of hu
man sexuality for requesting lay 
roups in the community and to 
refer individuals with specific 
problems to appropriate special
ists Michael Aptman, president 
of the Medical Student Sex Infor
mation Foriim, explained that 
through working in clinics with so 
2FEk people, We realize how ig
norant people are about human 
sexuality. People just do not un 
derstand the importance of sex. 
There exist so many pre-conceived notions and back-room the
ories One of the largest problems
in so many marriages is sex and 
the lack of actually understati
ng the body and its functions. Wewant to get to people now and help
them. More important, even, is 
working with high school groups 
so that they don't have to learn in 
the back-room."
We try not to deal with individ
uals, but would prefer to refer per
sonal problems. Our real function 
is to inform people. The suggest
ed approach is a formal presenta
tion including audio-visual aides,
followed by a question-and-answer
period from the floor. We pre
fer speaking with mixed groups 
men and women, of about 15-50 
participants, continued 
Aptman. And we request that all 
members of the group know each 
other previous to the meeting so 
that discussion can be uninhibited 
and casual. In addition, counse
lors are available after the discus
sion for those persons with speci
fic problems.
Ther-e-are two basie-sets of fea
tures. the first concerning thejiuman sexual response and the sec
ond dealing with conception, con
traception, and abortion. The 
speakers are prepared to discuss 
related subjects if sufficient time 
is given in advance to prepare a 
presentation.
This particular group of medi
cal students has studied with Dr. 
Ronald Chez, professor of Obste
trics and gynocology at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh and practic
ing doctor at Magee Women's 
Hospital. As well as receiving spe
cial training in the areas of hu
man sexuality, all of the speakers 
are clinically experienced.
Through news of the Medical 
Student Information Forum has 
not yet penetrated the C-MU cam
pus, responses from other cam
pus' and community groups have 
been great. The forum has pre
sented their program with com
plete success to a variety of 
groups.
Although there is no charge for 
these services, a $10 fee for each 
session is asked to defray the costs 
of audiovisual material and mail
ing. If there are special problems 
with funding, appropriate ar
rangements can be made.
Inquiries can be made by call
ing the Dean's Office at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh School of 
Medicine, 683-1620, ext. 337, or by

TPF THURSDAY FORUM TOPIC
Does Pittsburgh need a Tacti
cal Police Force? If so, how 
should it be used? Why is it used 
in black areas of the city and often 
on hand when large groups of stu
dents gather at a public event? 
What kind of men should serve on 
it and what kind of training should 
they have? What kind of police 
service do black areas of the city 
really need?
The questions and others will be 
discussed at this week's Thurs
day Noon Forum at James Givner, president of Forever Action 
Together, a Homewood-Brushton 
citizens' ^group. Mr. Givner has 
been critical of the Tactical Police 
Force in the past and has some 
specific ideas for better police 
service in Pittsburgh.
The Forum now takes place in 
the Staff Cafeteria on the lower 
level of Skibo. Anyone may bring 
lunch right in from the main cafe
teria. The program begins at 12:30 
and adjourns by 1:30.

image 01 even a series of imag
es. The many random spasms of 
activity lacked shape, control, 
and intensity, consequently the 
play never became involving.
The second halt of the play, 
howevei. at least began to come 
alive. The gimmicks began to 
work when all the lights went 
off and the king kept all of the 
actors at attention with a flash
light. He bore all the malignance 
ot a drill sargeant as he slowly 
moved the flashlight within in
ches of then eyes. The scene at 
the end of the play also gripped 
the audience when the overly 
intellectual estranged student 
type took the picture of those 
who lived in his apartment 
building. The intensity of the
student's face and the mechan
ical impersonal use of the cam
era turned his models off and 
with the single reverberating 
click of the machine, each walk
ed away. At tne end. the au
dience begins to share the para
noic. estranged loneliness of 
the student as the dreary dulling 
sound of rain comes from the 
omnipresent tape recordei.
But the best thing by far 
about Reichman's venture into 
new progressive theatre, is that 
at times he captures the actual 
vibrations of existence. As all of 
the actors are sitting around on 
chairs and stools, they respond 
instinctively to the sound and 
implications of -what some one 
is saying, rather than to the actual words he chose to use. For 
instance, one person having just 
been rejected by group one goes 
to group two. and as he furtive
ly asks his question again, group 
two shakes its head no. Group 
two is not answering the ques
tion so much as they are join
ing group one in putting the per
son down.
As a whole the production 
just manages to be acceptable. 
Those who saw Reichman's first 
play. "Nocturnes'will prob
ably be dissappointed. but to 
those who care to support ex
perimental theatre, and to those 
who have nothing better to do. 
I recommend that you see "N'aga Uta ".

Rifle Team Shooting For
First Place In WPIRL
It seems like winning teams 
at CMU went out with the 1937 
Notre Dame game. Perhaps if 
one looked at the stalwart little 
team of trigger men. whose 
home field is the third basement 
of "Maggie Murph" he would 
get a different picture.
Last Wednesday night. Coach 
Rummel gathered the squad, told 
them how much he'd like to win 
and then drove off to meet Pitt's 
Panthers. After the smoke had 
cleared. Tech walked away with 
a record high team score. 1318. 
and a first place berth shared 
with the Panthers.
This was not the first time the 
Tartans had broken 1300 this 
season. Their meet with Clainon 
last November saw the Riflemen 
post the previous record of 1306.
The Saturday before last, the 
Tech shooters met Indiana at 
home and were defeated 1315 
to 1279. This evened the score 
between CMU and IUP. We had 
topped them in the first match 
in what proved to be a real 
squeaker since the total score, 
and the total standing scores 
were tied, but Tech won with an 
8 point kneeling advantage. This 
match had its high points too as 
Wray Paul, the astounding fresh
man shooter put up the match 
high with an amazing 276.
Even though the team is now 
tied with Indiana for second 
place, theystill have an excel
lent chance to take first place in 
the WPIRL. The Tartans have 
suffered three losses so farthe recent one to Indiana, and
early defeats this season to Pitt 
and to Duquesne. They have 
won the other seven league 
matches beating Indiana. Pitt, 
and Clarion at least once, and 
often going to record lengths to 
do so.
This past Saturday. CMU met 
Penn State in then annual non
league match. Although the 
Tartans lost, as expected, they 
posted a new record high for 
the team, a 1326. Freshman. 
Wry Paul shot an even more as
tounding 286 (that's an all-Am
erican type score i. and senior 
Fran O'Donnell, who's been hav
ing his troubles this season, scor
ed a 273.
If they can continue to post 
scores above 1300. Tech shoot
ers will have a good chance to 
capture first place. With the 
phenomenol ability of Wry Paul, 
the reliability of seniors Eric 
Sandgren and Rich Boynton, 
the talent of freshman Norm Ca
ble. senior Fran O'Donnel. jun
ior Bill Clayton, sophomore 
Gary Arnold, and freshman 
Gary Masgrave and Will Higaski. the CMU Rifle Team has an 
opportunity to capture first place 
this season. We re tired of losing 
teams Mr. Haynes. We re shoot
ing for first place.

CMU Cagers Top Allegheny, 63-59
The Tartans' patented second 
half come-from-behind rally fin
ally succeeded as the CMU five 
topped Allegheny Wednesday 
63-59. This was the third win 
for the Tartans in fourteen deci
sions while the Gators remained
winless.
The Tartans got off to a slow 
start but the hot hands of Bob 
Brown and Bob Grazzini kept 
Tech within striking distance in 
the first half. Meanwhile. Alle
gheny displayed good shooting 
and a balanced scoring attack to 
lead by as much as six points.
Early in the second half, the 
CMU rebounding advantage be
came an important factor as the 
Tartans began to get many sec
ond. third and fourth shots.
When Brown hit a jumper at 
15:20. the Tartans took a 39-38 
lead. Bill Weborg came off the 
bench to help shoot the Tartans 
in front by nine then they coast
ed the rest of the way for the 
win.
The next Tech home game is 
tomorrow night at 8:15 p.m. 
when Marietta will invade the 
Skibo gym. Then the Tartans 
hit the road for the weekend for 
back to back night games 
against Case and Western Re
serve  which almost sounds like
a team travelling toPittsburgh

The girl's basketball team won 
its third straight at Chatham 47- 
28. The Tech girls' team-work 
was noticeable in the even scor
ing: Paula Vergith led with 17 
points. Nancy Chandler follow
ed with 15. Linda Hood 9. and 
Carol Joseph 6.
Tech took the lead immedi
ately after theopening jump 
with several quick baskets and 
the Chatham press was not ef
fective against the quick plays. 
Although the Chatham for
wards were dangerous, they did 
not score as well as they could 
have due to the defensive work 
of Karen Wise and Mary Bookwalter.
