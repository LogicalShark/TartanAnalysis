Armed Robbery In Scobell Hall
Three University of Pittsburgh 
students have been charged with 
the shotgun robbery of a Carnegie-Mellon student in his dormi
tory room last Monday afternoon.
James Schmidhammer, of 111 
Scobell Hall, was beaten, bound, 
and robbed of $40.00. He was ta
ken to Shadyside Hospital where 
he received six stitches in his face.
Two of the suspects were appre
hended by CMU Security Officers 
immediately after the crime. The 
third suspect was arrested at his 
home two hours later by city po
lice.
According to police, the sus
pects carried the long barrelled, 12 
gauge shotgun to Schmidhammers 
room in a guitar case.
Schmidhammer told Security 
that he was lying on his bed when 
he heard a knock on his door. 
Opening the door, he saw three 
masked people, and was immedi
ately punched with brass knuckles 
in the left side of his face.
The punch knocked Schmid
hammer to the floor, and the sus
pects proceeded to cover his
Various articles found in the possession of the suspects or in the guitar case they left behind in the room, including: three 
masks, one tire iron, four shotgun shells, one revolver, two bullets, one hunting knife, one wooden club, one pair of gloves, one 
roll of adhesive tape, and several stockings. A 12 gauge shotgun and a set of brass knuckles were later recovered behind 
Woodland Terrace.
mouth and eyes with adhesive 
tape, and to bind his wrists, knees, 
and ankles. Before his eyes were 
taped, Schmidhammer noticed a 
small revolver in the hand of one of 
the suspects.
His next contact with the revol
ver came when it was put up to his 
chin. One of them asked him 
where his money was. He told 
them it was in his wallet, which 
they took from his back pocket, 
then they ransacked his room.
Schmidhammers neighbor, 
Jack Cohen, had become suspi
cious when he heard the door slam
med shut, and put a glass up to the 
wall to listen inside. Convinced 
that there was trouble, he tried to 
phone Security. But failing to get 
through by the school switch
board, he told some other resi
dents about the trouble and went 
outside to find a Security van.
Security alerted the city police, 
and proceeded to Scobell Hall. 
Dorm residents began knocking on 
Schmidhammers door and calling 
his nickname, Schmitty. When 
there was no answer they knocked 
and called more loudly a second 
time.
The suspects went to the win
dow to escape. As they jumped 
from the window, Security Direc
tor Taylor entered the room and 
found Schmidhammer.
When the suspects landed, they 
found Security Coordinator Fred 
Schoettle. One was holding the 
revolver, and as he turned to 
Schoettle, Schoettle knocked the 
loaded revolver from his hand and 
put him under arrest.
The other two suspects fled, 
one with the shotgun. The un
armed suspect was chased by Stu
dents across Margaret Morrison 
Street, behind Donner Hall, to 
Devon Road where, exhausted, he 
was arrested by 3 Secuirty Officers 
who had been notified by radio 
that he was coming.
The armed suspect remained at 
large until his companions gave po
lice his home address, where he 
was arrested two hours later.
The shotgun and the brass 
knuckles were found at the rear of 
Woodlawn Terrace.
The guitar case, which was left 
in the room, was found to contain 
one tire iron, one club, one hunt
ing knife, and four shotgun shells.
Commenting on all the equip
ment, Director Taylor said, the 
suspects have been watching too 
much TV.
Each suspect has been charged 
with burglary, armed robbery, and 
assault and battery, and one sus
pect has additionally been charged 
with larceny for stealing the revol
ver. Taylor says there is a good 
chance each will get off.
City police detained Schmid
hammer on suspicion of narcotics 
found in his room, but tests on the 
items found proved negative and 
Schmidhammer was sent back to 
CMU with a clean record.
Syria Mosque Bans CMU Rock Concerts
As a result of last Friday nights 
Allman Brothers concert, the man
agement of the Syria Mosque has 
banned any further CMU-sponsored major rock concerts from 
that hall. Consequently, it is 
doubtful that the Activities Board 
will be able to sponsor any major 
concerts after the upcoming Virgil 
Fox/Pablos Lights concert.
The Allman Brothers concert 
was stormed by approximately 
400 gate crashers. The crowd was 
informed that no more seats were 
available. A few left; the rest tried 
to enter illegally by breaking win
dows and removing window 
frames, or by charging the doors.
One door was broken off its hinges. 
Some ticket holders opened doors 
from the inside for the gate crash
ers.
The Activities Board had hired 
six off-duty policemen for crowd 
control. But eventually, 48 Pitts
burgh policemen were called to the 
scene.
After the concert began, the po
lice surrounded the theatre to cov
er all entrances. But the gate crash
ers persistantly circled the building 
until they could find a weak spot in 
the police line through which to 
charge a door.
The police refused to disperse 
the crowd until a law was broken
and an official complaint filed. 
Half an hour after the concert star
ted they cleared the streets by 
threatening with billy clubs and 
dogs. No one was hurt or arrested 
however, and most of the ticket 
holders inside the Mosque were not 
aware that anything irregular was 
happening.
The management of the Mosque 
blames CMU on two counts, even 
though the majority of gate crash
ers were not from the University. It 
claims the Activities Board should 
have hired more security, and that 
the concert should not have been 
advertised off campus.
The off campus publicity con
sisted of an ad in the University of 
Pittsburgh newspaper and one rad
io spot on WDVE-FM.
The Activities Board had been 
told by the Mosque that the Allman Brothers concert was a trial 
run. After the concert the manage
ment said absolutely that there 
would be no more CMU concerts 
held at Syria Mosque after Virgil 
Fox/Pablos Lights.
A similar, though less serious, 
incident occured last spring at the 
Carnegie Music Hall when the Act 
ivities Board presented B. B. King. 
The management of the Music Hall 
used minor incidents as an excuse 
to ban future CMU rock concerts
from that hall.
Even if Friday nights fiasco had 
been minor, it would have been 
sufficient cause to the Mosque for 
the banning of future rock con
certs. Its employes are accustomed 
to nothing but ballet, symphony, 
and opera crowds, and were over
whelmed by the frantic efforts of 
rock fans to enter free. One 20year 
veteran ticket-taker had his eye
glasses shattered and lost his hear
ing aid when approximately 20 
youths hurled themselves through 
the door where he was stationed.
Before the evening was over, all 
the ushers had walked out. The

Letters
Open Letter from Security
On Monday afternoon, a stu
dent in Scobell Hall was assaulted 
and robbed by three male subjects. 
The offenders reportedly used 
brass knuckles in the assault. They 
were capable of even more serious 
harm since they were armed with a 
12 gauge shotgun, a 38 caliber re
volver, club, knife, and tire iron. 
The victim, fellow students, a staff 
member, and responding Security 
Officers were exposed to the risk 
of serious bodily injury or death. 
Our information as to motive indi
cates the offenders belief that 
large amounts of money were pre
sent, the fruits of a drug dealer
ship. No concrete evidence in Se
curitys possession supports this 
motive, but it was a belief that 
apparently lured these offenders 
to the campus in the hope of a 
good takeone sufficient to jus
tify the risk.
We earnestly again point out 
that the belief among some that 
drug traffic exists on college cam
puses does bring a sizeable percent
age of violent offenders to their 
grounds. When this happens, the 
risk involved for the victim, his 
fellow campus participants, Secur
ity Officers, and public police offi
cers is definitely increased.
Who is responsible? Well, sev
eral people:
 The Pushera current song that 
epitimizes his role i.e., G D the 
pusher man
 The Studentwho because of 
peer pressure and his own values
decides to ignore the situation
 The Buyer-who for that new 
experience creates the market
 Securitywho may not have 
been aggressive enough in its ef
forts or relied too much upon City 
Police response.
And, philosophically depend
ing upon the definers values, one 
could go on and on placing blame 
even to the point of saying that 
ours is a captialistic system, that 
attempts to control the wrong 
things in the wrong way. But, Se
curitys concern is much less ab
stract. Its a concern for the safety 
and welfare of all campus partici
pants.
Students, staff, and Security 
Officers who responded to protect 
a victim and apprehend several 
armed offenders could well have 
been killed on Monday. Regardless 
of ones personal values on the use 
of drugs, we are all united in our 
disdain for violence.
CMU Security, in an effort to 
prevent and control all campus 
crime, has an obligation to take 
legal action in conjunction with 
public enforcement agencies in an 
effort to preserve the security and 
safety of all CMU participants 
from all threats whether it be the 
minor larceny, the drug trafficer, 
and or the violent offender. We 
again ask your assistance, especial
ly in terms of information con
cerning any offenses which occurs 
on our campus, and we will take 
affirmative action. What is your 
responsibility???
Ron Taylor, Director of Security 
Blow-Up
Editor, the TARTAN:
In response to Joel Schwartzs 
question last week, Why should I 
have to see a film two or three 
times to understand it? I offer 
this answer:
Film is life
If you dont understand life,
Dont expect to understand film.
Herman Unger 73
Editors Note
Editor, the TARTAN:
Of course, as a Film Baron, I 
have seen Deux Heures and sev
eral other Pazzo greats, and have in 
the past considered presenting one 
of his masterpieces to a CMU audi
ence. But lack of support from the 
film constituency frustrated my 
plans. Perhaps now with your 
brilliant expose of the man and his 
work to campus readership, CMU 
film lovers will rally in support of 
this overlooked genius.
Bill Iacono
Director of Activities Board
The War And The Economy
As part of last weeks morator
ium, Professors Daniel Resnick 
and Leonard Rapping conducted 
an informal public discussion on 
the topic: The War and the 
Economy-Where are we Headed.
Dr. Resnick, of the CMU His
tory Department, initiated the pre
sentation with an explication of 
his notion that we, as Americans, 
must make an effort to restore 
things to their proper political per
spectives, cautioning that:
we are in terrible danger as a 
people of losing our sense of what 
the real world is.. .We cannot see 
what the real world is like if we 
listen to the official messages we 
get.
Dr. Rapping, of the GSIA, then 
took the lead in expounding the 
thesis that US expenditures on the 
Vietnam War are at the root of the 
current international monetary 
crises. According to Rapping, the 
War expenses have destroyed 
Americas recent favorable balance 
of trade, and, to compensate, the 
present administration has adopted several economic controls 
including the wage-price freeze 
and a re-evaluation of the dollar.
In 1964, United States exports 
were valued at 9 billion dollars 
more the US imports. With this 
surplus, America was able to main
tain a rather large economic and 
military presence in disparate parts 
of the globe. The equilibrium of 
the situation was rudely upset,
however, when America com
mitted herself to large expendi
tures in the Vietnam theatre.
To raise the necessary funds for 
the expansion of the War she had 
to either improve her balance of 
trade or print more money. The 
Johnson Administration opted to 
print more money rather than in
crease taxes, and what had been a 
minimal inflationary trend was ac
celerated. As a direct consequence 
of Johnsons inflationary policy, 
American goods became more ex
pensive relative to foreign goods 
and the US trade surplus deteriora
ted until, in the first half of 1971, 
America was saddled with a half 
billion dollar trade deficit.
It was in response to this deficit 
that President Nixon recently in
voked several drastic constraints. 
A 10% import tax was established 
to discourage the purchasing of 
foreign goods and diminish cash 
flow our of the US. Additionally, 
the Nixon Administration is pres
sing other countries to re-value 
their currencies to a higher level in 
relation to US currency. This 
would, in effect, devalue the American dollar and increase the 
outflow of American goods, where 
cost would drop in relation to for
eign currencies.
European nations resent having 
to reevaluate their currency be
cause it disturbs inter-European 
exchange rates; and thus, the 
monetary crisis and consequent
fiscal arbitration.
As a final stab at restoring a 
favorable balance of trade, a wageprice freeze has been imposed at 
home to keep the cost of Ameri
can-made goods from rising.
What has not been done to res
tore a favorable balance of trade is 
an ending of US involvement in 
Vietnam. Drs. Rapping and Res
nick stressed this as symptomatic 
of Americas warped priorities, 
and indicative of the failure of her 
current leadership. Resnick 
pointed out with incredulity that 
the recent State of the Union Ad
dress, although it dealt with the 
precarious state of the American 
economy, was devoid of any men
tion of our continued presence in 
Vietnam.
Following Dr. Rappings criti
cal analysis of American economic 
directions, reactions from the au
dience were solicited. The group of 
listeners was small and the infor
mal atmosphere of the presenta
tion encouraged an easy exchange 
of ideas. There was a general con
sensus among those present that 
Rappings overview was logical, 
and consequently, that the 
governments policies were deplor
able. But confusion was expressed 
as to how priorities might be re
ordered. The identity of the en
emy seemed obscure. As one stud
ent phrased it: Isnt Nixon just a 
tool. .. of the faceless thing were 
fighting. continued col. 4

Noting that responsive popular 
mechanisms for determining fed
eral activities are not available, Dr. 
Resnick expressed personal faith in 
the electoral process as potentially 
corrective. He said he is especially 
optimistic about the upcoming el
ections because of what he per
ceives to be a significant public 
swing to the left, and because of 
the new crop of under 21 voters 
about to be unleashed on the Am
erican political scene for the first
time. Resnick characterized the 
present period as a possible policy 
pivotal point, convinced that he 
was engaged in the most hopeful 
moratorium talk Ive been involved 
in for six years. Dr. Rapping was 
less convinced about the power of 
the vote but admitted that the 
electoral process does represent 
some form of retraint.
Jon Manon

light and sound technicians, who 
were under contract to work until 
11:30 PM, turned the lights on at 
11:27. The Allman Brothers play
ed a 3 minute encore.
The concert was described as 
beautiful and a success, ex
cept that the sound system failed 
after Wet Willy, leaving the Allman 
Brothers to stand on stage for 40 
minutes before they could begin. 
The sound system broke because 
many of the gate crashers in the 
aisles were sitting on the wires.
With the late start and the 
groups popularity, the concert 
would assuredly have gone on 
much longer if the lights hadnt 
been turned on.
Bill Iacono, director of the Act
ivities Board, said, the illict en
try of several hundred people, 
coupled with the actions of many 
inside was unfortunate for those of 
us who wish to see future high cost 
entertainment at reasonable ticket 
prices.
The Activities Board feels that 
in the future it might confine itself 
to lectures, plays, films, and coffee 
houses since the problems increase
with every concert. If a person is 
interested in attending rock con
certs there are several local pro
moters who present, on the aver
age, 2 concerts a week open to 
anyone who can afford them at $6 
to $8 a ticket. And if one cant 
afford them, he can crash them 
which is even less expensive than 
the average $3 ticket for a CMU 
concert.
Of course, Iacono said, this 
type of crowd reaction could 
jeopardize Skibo Ballroom act
ivities as well. The Activities Board 
is not willing to become a police 
organization. It is a non-profit en
tertainment organization which 
can no longer financially afford to 
sponsor rock concerts at discount 
ticket prices if it must contend 
with the threat of vandalism and 
the extra cost of secuirty.
There is now no concert hall 
within easy access to CarnegieMellon in which an Activities 
Board sponsored rock conert can 
take place.

Jean-Francois Revel, noted 
French columnist and author of 
the controversial book Without 
Marx or Jesus: the New American 
Revolution has Begun, spoke 
here last Thursday. During an hour 
long lecture which ended with a 
question and answer period, Revel 
discussed some of the points made 
in his book on why the new revolu
tion would have to take place in 
the United States.
Revel, at the opening of his lec
ture, said that there are two kinds 
of people he comes up against: 
those who are furious when told 
there is a revolution going on, and 
those who are furious when told 
there is no revolution.
The United States has devel
oped a new concept in revolution 
dissent. For this reason, along with
several others, including the fact 
that the U.S. is advanced techni
cally and economically, Revel be
lieves that the U.S. is the ideal 
place for the new revolution.
This revolution cannot be 
Marxist because history proves 
that a Marxist revolution in its true 
form cannot exist. And, Revel 
said, a Jesus Revolution cannot 
occur either because their move
ment may consolidate itself solely 
under its religious aspect and lead 
to a gigantic dropping out.
However, he does acknowledge 
that the revolution does not neces
sarily have to be violent but can be 
similar to the passive resistance 
used by blacks during the 1960s. 
(Revel commented that passive 
resistance was a kind of violence 
in that it was disruptive in nature.)
Violence can occur without 
there being a revolution as shown 
in Bolivia, which has had 190 re
gimes accompanied by coup de 
tats but still no real revolution. In 
fact, violence is more often used in 
counterrevolution than revolu
tion. Then, too, the American New 
Left has actually created new tac
tics of revolutionnew ideas in 
new situtations.
Later in the day, Revel at
tended a history seminar in Porter 
Hall where he is reported to have 
revealed a more interesting and 
probing look at America as com
pared to France and the possibili
ties of revolution.
Before he left Skibo Ballroom, 
Revel talked with students and 
signed autographs: With Deep 
Sympathy, Revel.

A UTHOR S NOTE: Since this wri
ter spends an unusual amount of 
time within the dark confines of 
Pittsburghs various film showing 
establishments, he has decided 
from time-to-time to review the 
theaters and the comforts which 
they provide or deny the paying 
customer. The comments con
tained in this series are wholly sub
jective and are based upon the idio
syncrasies and need for comfort 
that this six foot one inch, one 
hundred and forty-three pound 
film fanatic requires.
When one is discussing the 
Associated Theaters downtown 
establishments, the discussion 
usually begins with the FULTON 
THEATERif one is working up 
from the bottom of the list. Lo
cated at 101 Sixth Street, the Ful
ton is easily the shabbiest, most 
run down, first-run theater in Pitts
burgh.
As one approaches the Fulton, 
one gets the idea that something is 
wrong for he encounters two box 
offices, one for the Fulton, and 
one for the Fulton-Mini (to be dis
cussed in a later article). During 
the slack hours, both box offices 
are run by one cashier, so the 
length of your wait is determined 
by how many people want to see 
the other picture. Once one has 
finally found the correct window, 
paid the admission of two dollars 
and fifty cents, and received a tic
ket manufactured by the Globe 
Ticket Company of Philadelphia, 
one is ready to enter the theater.
The Fultons lobby is elongated 
and divided in half by dirty, faded, 
worn velvet ropes, or by dirty 
white tapes which resemble old 
safety patrol belts. The effect of 
this division is to create two rows 
along the upward sloping theater 
lobby which are not unlike re
versed cattle shutes. Up the ramp 
on the right the people entering 
the theater are smashed together 
by ushers who continually urged 
on to Move up as far as you can, 
please. As one moves along, or 
stands bunched together waiting 
with several hundred other people, 
one has time to admire the decor 
of the Fultons lobby.
The lobby was once decorated 
in what appears to have been royal 
blue, but now the court appears to 
have fallen upon hard times, for 
the blue which exists there now is 
far from royal, sky or any other 
blue. It can perhaps best be de
scribed as a dingy blue.
As one continues to move up 
the lobby he passes the entrance to 
the balcony with its ever present 
notice that the balcony is closed.
At the end of the lobby are the rest 
rooms. (Although Ive been in
formed that the ladies room is 
quite nice, Ill have to take that on 
faith, for knowing Pittsburgh wo
men, if I ever decided to check it 
out for myself I might never get 
back out.) The mens room at the 
Fulton is stylishly decorated in 
what might be called the very early 
bus station school of design. Its 
permanently dull gray tiles give 
one the impression that they might 
disentigrate if they were ever to 
come in contact with a little Mr. 
Clean.
Leaving the mens room, if one 
chooses to stop at the water foun
tain, hed better make certain that 
the film is not just beginning, for it 
usually takes the neophyte a while 
to figure out how to work it, and 
then how to drink out of it with
out getting soaking wet.
When the customers are finally 
allowed into the viewing section of 
the theater, an uncontrollable feel
ing runs over themrevulsion. The 
seats in the Fulton are a dirty, 
faded blue which is on the verge of 
turning gray. The paint on the 
back of the seats has worn off in 
places, and the back of the seats 
themselves are stained with just a - 
bout everything imaginable. This 
gives the impression that the Ful
ton hasnt been cleaned thorough
ly for a time, and this may be so, 
for this writer has been findi lghis 
favorite seat for sometime now by 
looking for a huge black tar-like 
stain on the back of the seat which 
is in front of it.
When one finally decides to risk 
sitting down, one is free to look at 
the hanging, ample bosoms of the 
semi-nude women who perpetual
ly dance on the ceiling just above 
the screen. Why they were painted 
there is anybodys guess, but they 
appear to be the only part of the 
Fulton which hasnt deteriorated 
over the years.
As ones eyes begin to lower 
either because ones date is feeling 
vastly inferior or because ones 
neck is getting stiff, two sculp
tured scenes, one on each side of 
the screen, are noticed. These 
pieces of sculpture depict what 
look like two sea creatures playing 
violins. Naturally, these two sculp
tures together with the little fi
gures which appear to be attending 
them have nothing to do with any
thing else in the decor, but they 
could conceivably be called cute 
by some kind old lady, and un
doubtedly looked good on the 
drawing board, so they stay where 
they are, badly in need of a dust
ing.
Before the lights dim, one has a 
good chance to inspect the blue 
curtain hanging in front of the 
screen. This curtain may be the 
only thing in the entire theater
thats in worse condition than the 
seats. Faded, threadbare, and ap
pearing to be stained in places, the 
curtain is badly in need of replace
ment since it is obviously beyond 
repair.
When the curtain rises, or 
moves aside depending upon what 
button whomever is in charge 
pushes, then the positive aspects of 
the Fulton reveal themselves. The 
screen of the Fulton is comforta
bly large, and it does justice to 
even the wide screen Panivision, 
Cinemascope and other such pro
cessed motion pictures. The viewer 
is not short changed at the Fulton 
when it comes to getting the feel
ing of expansiveness which wide 
screen films are supposed to deli
ver. The Fulton was the first thea
ter in Pittsburgh equipped for 
Cinemascope, and ever since it 
hosted the premier showing of the 
first wide screen film, THE ROBE, 
it has remained a theater which 
will deliver to its audience the full 
sweep of a wide screen film.
The sound at the Fulton is also 
very good. While not equipped for 
stereo, the fidelity of the theaters 
sound system is more than ade
quate.
The projection at the Fulton is 
above average for Pittsburgh. The 
curtain is always opened on time, 
the film is always framed perfectly 
(of course with a screen that big 
how could one miss?), the reels are 
shown in order, transitions be
tween reels are made without the 
audience being aware of what is 
happening, and the projectors are 
kept in good working order so that 
they dont break down-if only 
other theaters could make this 
claim!
The climate at the Fulton is one 
of the best controlled in Pitts
burgh-one never freezes in sum
mer nor does one roast in winter. 
The heating and air-conditioning 
units in the Fulton are somehow 
kept at just the right level to assure 
that the patrons are kept comfort
able.
On the whole, the Fulton is a 
rather good movie theater which is 
just desperately in need of a tho
rough face lifting to restore its 
grandeur. Renovations done by a 
competent team of designers not 
taken with kitsching up the place 
could transform the Fulton into 
one of the best theaters in the city. 
Since the Fulton is obviously mak
ing money or it would have been 
closed down, one wonders what 
keeps the Associated chain from 
fixing it up. If it isnt going to 
bother with a face-lifting, then the 
least it could do is lower the ad
mission price to compensate the 
patrons for the comforts which 
they are not getting.

Boz Scaggs
San Francisco, the origin of the 
Jeffersonr Airplane, the Grateful 
Dead and Crosby, Stills and Nash, 
was also the origin of the Steve 
Miller Band, Before Steve Miller 
came into his own he was a Dallas 
high school kid and then a Min
nesota college kid. In college he 
^Ined local popularity playing in a 
combo with a high school friend 
who went college with him. After 
graduating Steve joined a group 
 called the Barry Goldberg Reunion 
and his friend went to Europe to 
become a streetsinger and later a 
blues guitarist in Stockholm.
By September 1965, Steve MilKI decided he wanted a group of 
his own and so contacted his friend 
by mail asking him to come back 
to Texas and join his group. The 
friends name was Boz Scaggs. By 
this time Boz had been discovered 
in Stockholm and recorded an al
bum on Polydor Records with his 
group. He had also become very 
 l/olved in drugs, which led to his 
narrowly escaping being busted in 
India with $2000 worth of hash 
hidden in his vest. Steve Millers 
group didnt work out and Boz 
went back to Europe and India. 
More than a year later Boz received 
another letter from Steve Miller, 
who was now based in San Fran,^co. Boz Scaggs returned to America to form with his friend The 
Steve Miller Band.
Boz Scaggs appeared on the 
groups first two albums contri
buting such songs as Dime a 
Dance Romance, Babys Calling 
Me Home and Overdrive. How
ever, as the group progressed Bozs 
C^.d Steves works vied for pro
minence and in the Spring of 1969 
Boz split from the group with no 
hard feelings between he and Steve 
Miller.
He then assembled a group 
and recorded an album on Atlantic 
records call Boz Scaggs which
was financially unsuccessful but 
became a standard player on San 
Francisco FM stations. It is still 
played with as much regularity as 
the Beatles and Crosby, Stills, 
Nash and Young. Quite realistical
ly Boz Scaggs is a living legend on 
the west coast.
Since his Atlantic album he has 
acquired a new group, a new re
cord label, and a new producer. He 
now records on Columbia Re
cords, his orchestra consists of 8 
musicians including himself, and 
his producer is Glyn Johns who 
had quite a bit to do with the pro
duction and development of the 
Beatles album Let It Be. His 
first Columbia album is entitled 
Moments and is a showcase of 
the many sounds of Boz Scaggs 
and his group, ranging from a beau
tifully soft pleading sound in Mo
ments the title track to the rock 
sound in Hollywood Blues and 
country-blues in I will forever 
sing (the blues). There is also a 
country sound in Alone, Alone, 
a fully orchestral sound in 
Painted Bells and Near You, a 
Bosa-Nova sound in Downright 
Woman and a near oriental sound 
in the instrumental Can I Make It 
Last (Or Will It Just Be Over). A 
single released from the album is 
We Were Always Sweethearts. 
The album, as well as his stage per
formance, can then be considered 
a journey through the lifetime ex
periences of Boz Scaggs.
Boz Scaggs is currently making 
his first east cost tour with his new 
group and has appeared at the Uni
versity of Rhode Island and re
cently at Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania with the Rascals. He 
will perform two concerts in the 
Skibo Ballroom on Saturday, 
November 6th, sponsored by the 
Activities Board. Showtimes will 
be 7:30 and 10:15 PM and tickets 
are $2.50 or $1.50 with an ID.
Tickets go on sale at the Skibo 
Information Desk on Friday, Oc
tober 22nd. Also appearing on the 
bill will be Coster, Welling and Wallach, an excellent country fiddle 
group.
Boz Scaggs has recently re
corded a second album on Colum
bia which is presently being distri
buted. The members of his group 
are: Boz Scaggslead guitar, Pat 
OHara trombone, Jymm 
Young organ, David 
Brown-bass, Doug Simrilguitar, 
Mel Martintenor sax, George 
Rains (who somewhat resembles 
Dr. Ned VanderVen)-drums, and 
Tom Pooletrumpet.
As Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling 
Stone said, If youve ever had an 
album youve just about glued 
onto the turntable, to play over 
and over again, to start each of 
your days, to drive your lover or 
roommates crazy, then youll un
derstand about San Francisco and 
Boz Scaggs.

Railfans
Railfans are people who derive 
satisfaction from watching, photo
graphing and riding trains. On this 
campus, they are not rare. They 
are interested in various fields rela
ting to railroads: trollies, com
muter trains, and Pittsburghs mass 
transit problem; locomotives; the 
new US inter-city passenger train 
corporation (Amtrak); model rail
roading; railroad history, and 
more.
Railfan faculty and administra
tors included Dr. Rothfus, who has 
done extensive historical research; 
Dean Swank, whose father was a 
locomotive engineer; and Dean 
Strehler, an avid train rider. Club 
activities will be guided by mem
ber interest, but will at least in
clude guest speakers, films, and 
trips to local points of interest.
Many people have said railroads 
are irrelevent today; that nobody 
rides trains anymore. The simple 
fact remains that railroads are, 
financially and ecologically, the 
most efficient means of mass trans
portation of people and goods. A 
double track line has the capacity 
of a 20-lane highway, and railroads 
transport 42% of the nations 
freight on only 10% of the fuel 
used for all freight transportation. 
Although the work they perform is 
invisible to most people, our quali
ty of life today would substancially lower without this mode of 
low-cost transportation.
Further goalsof the club will be 
to encourage rail travel when Am 
trak improves it, and to attempt to 
correct the misconceptions many 
hold about their railroad system. If 
you are interested, contact Ronald 
McElrath, 505 E-Tower 682-8716, 
or Phil Frank, Delta Tau Delta 
Fraternity, and watch at Skibo for 
future meeting dates.

Once again the CMU Tartans 
are back on their feet, pleasing a 
large Homecoming crowd with 
their 24-7 drubbing of Allegheny, 
1 Saturday. While at times inconsis
tent this season, when the Tartans 
click, they really click.
Both teams appeared to be a 
little sleepy in the first quarter. 
With only 45 seconds gone, CMU 
coughed up the ball inside its own 
10 yard line, but the defense held 
for its first brilliant goal line stand. 
^Afterwards, though, neither team 
could give the crowd much to buzz 
about.
Midway through through the 
second quarter Brian Carlock 
made a good grab of a Rich Squires 
pass at the Gators twenty. From 
there, using its consistently strong 
ground game, Tech scored largely 
on the running of Terry Bell, who 
now leads the club with a whop
ping 6Vi yards per carry. Tom 
Lombardo, who displayed deft 
balance and tough, hard-nosed 
running, punched it over for the 
TD. The point after was blocked 
partially due to the fact that CharSoccer
The CMU soccer team has 
solved its overtime woes. After 
having lost to Pitt in that fashion, 
the booters have made sure that no 
one scores after the regulation 
game is completed. No one, not 
even a CMU player. In what ap
pears to be a season beset with 
poor luck and missed opportuni
ties at the start, CMU has added 
two draws, the first a 1-1 affair 
with Bethany last Wednesday, and 
the latter a 3-3 giveaway to St. 
Francis on Saturday. At Bethany, 
West Virginia, the team displayed a 
sound defense without much of
fense, and had to tally with five 
minutes left in the game on a 
picture play from Bencic to Moses
Cross Country
After a 21-40 defeat from Cali
fornia and a 26-32 setback by Gen
eva, Coach Meckleys hurried har
riers defeated St. Vincent 26-29 on 
the opponents 4.9 mile course, 
Kloes the quick and Movin McKay 
maintained their early lead for the 
1-2 finish. Making a cautious 
comeback from a pulled muscle, 
Dennis Sullivan finished sixth 
while Tom Silvis, who has been 
hampered by a knee injury, fin
ished eighth. Greg Hyatts ninth 
place clinched the meet.
Defeats can be perplexing in 
themselves. Though defeated by 
California and Geneva, CMUs har
riers have given better and better 
performances. Even though he 
placed second against California, 
Ken Kloes broke that schools 
course record. Hampered by 
cramps in previous meets, Wayne 
Bingham came through beautifully 
to place fifth against Geneva. And 
in every meet Dave Byers mile per 
mile time has improved.
Theres more for which we 
strive; come see our next home 
meet against St. Vincent, October 
25.
lie Price hasnt really had a chance 
to get his timing down at his new 
position. And at the half it was 
CMU 6, Allegheny zip.
The second half kept the fans 
interested as CMU again opened up 
the scoring thanks to a fantastic 
clutch catch by Price, which sent 
his defender away talking to him
self. Lombardo again got the six 
but the try for two failed and CMU 
led, 12-0.
Then, all of a sudden, Al
legheny staged a mild comeback, 
on fourth and goal from the eight 
they somehow scored after the 
Tartan defense had seemingly sur
rounded their quarterback 12 
yards from the goal line.
But the defense wasnt to be 
denied. Proving they could score as 
easily and as often as the offense, 
the defense sealed off an imperme
able sideline wall that enabled 
Brian Carlock to jog 70 yards to 
paydirt. It was Carlo.cks good 
sense, not his speed that broked 
the play open. He patiently fol
lowed his blockers, Ray Terza in 
particular, all the way to give Tar
tan fans their biggest thrill of a yet
in order to even the score at 1-1. 
The overtime period passed with
out many opportunities for either 
side.
As the game against St. Francis 
opened in Loretto, Pa., CMU 
seemed ready to explode. Down 
1-0, the Red started to move, tied 
the score on a goal by Henry Levy, 
then collected on two successive 
penalty kicks by Peter Moses, who 
registered his fourth and fifth goals 
of the season. After the half-time 
intermission, however, St. Francis 
came back and CMU was unable to 
meet the challenge of the last per
iod equalizer. Both teams played 
cautiously to a draw in overtime, 
and the Red absorbed another 
moral defeat.
promising season.
Ronnie Shinault also got his 
licks in, picking off a Gator pass, 
but was knocked down by Terza 
who was eagerly looking for some
one to block. Oh well, Ron, what 
can you say?
And then, with 35 seconds left 
on the clock, Bill Vukoder, playing 
for the injured Terry Lyskava 
picked off another pass and raced 
60 yards for the score, outracing 
everyone, and mowing over 
would-be tacklers. Once he got to 
the end zone, he threw out his 
parachute and slammed down the 
ball, proving that all the Hot Dogs 
werent in A Phi Os refreshment 
stand.
All in all, it was a happy day 
forBig Red, who shoots for .500 
ball next Saturday against a rough 
n ready Franklin and Marshall. It 
should prove to be quite a match, 
the Tartans to get that elusive 2 
victory streak together. So. . .now 
that the Bucs have won, come on 
out and see Pittsburghs other 
team.
The problem that the CMU soc
cer team has yet to solve appears to 
be a lack of consistency between 
offense and defense from one 
game to the other. Coach March 
Krotee, in an attempt to find the 
solution, has since turned to a new 
offensive and defensive set-up 
which the Red will throw at Slip
pery Rock at 3:00 on Tuesday the 
12th. At this point, the CMU soc
cer team is like the toy train, 
which, with but one wheel off the 
track, short-circuits the entire 
system. If they can get that wheel 
back on track against Slippery 
Rock, they will start to roll, and 
our train will come in.

CMUs Tartans take on the un
defeated Franklin & Marshall Dip
lomats Saturday, Oct. 23 in what 
promises to be a close, hard-fought 
contest between two very keen ri
vals. The game, CMUs next to last 
at home, will begin at Tech Field at 
1:30 PM.
F & M might be the Tartans 
toughest oppoenet to date. The 
Diplomats defense is rated num
ber eight in the country for small 
colleges, having two shutouts to 
their credit and limiting four op
ponents to an average of 159.8 
yards total offense, 43 on the 
ground and 116 via passing. A big 
factor in the F & M defense has 
been the outstanding play of three 
junior linebackers, Lou Figari, 
Pete Adelaar and Craig Marks.
The Diplomats offense, run
ning from a.split slot formation, 
has averaged over 28 points per
l.M. Football
There were two very good foot
ball games the last week, and in 
both the result was at least a mild 
upset.
In the National, Pika took over 
first place by stopping previously 
undefeated Pepper and Salt, 
39-34. Pika took the opening kickoff and went in the score a 7-0 
lead. But P & S came back to score 
on an end sweep, and held a 20-19 
halftime lead. Each team scored 
once more in the third quarter, and 
it took a fourth quarter intercep
tion and two bombs to give Pika its 
final margin. The game seemed to 
turn on a few dropped TDs by P & 
S receivers and a few defensive lap
ses in their secondary. Pika was 
stopped once by interception, and 
often by penalty. If pika can stop
game thus far. First year head 
coach Bob Curtis has two experi
enced quarterbacks at his disposal 
in senior Larry Shadek and junior 
Bob Olender. Shadek has seen the 
most action so far and has thrown 
for 479 yards and three TDs. The 
Diplomats have a strong running 
back in Tom Mignone, a junior 
who is averaging almost five yards 
per carry, running for 243 yards in 
the three games in which hes 
played.
Tartan coach Joe Gasperella re
ports starting cornerback Terry 
Lyskava will be out because of a 
knee injury suffered in the Al
legheny game, and his place pro
bably will be taken by Bill Vuko
der. Otherwise, the Tartans will be 
healthy for the F & M game.
The game is the 19th meeting 
between the two schools, a series 
begun in 1909. CMU leads in the 
series 12-5-1.
ATO on Thursday, its first place 
for the defending champs.
Sigma Nu further clouded the 
American picture by beating SAE 
after upsetting the Black Magics on 
last Monday. The Zoo used excel
lent passing and a smart defense to 
gain downs in the final quarter to 
come from way down in the Black 
Magic game, ending on top 45-31. 
They reversed the pattern against 
the Sig Alphs, taking an early 10-0 
lead and always keeping one TD 
ahead. Each time the gap was 
closed, theyd score again. Good 
way to win games, 30-25. If the 
surprising SNs can pull one more 
upset, theyve got the playoffs. 
The Black Magics and Bets are the 
picks, though.
This weeks pick: Pika 38, ATO
20.
