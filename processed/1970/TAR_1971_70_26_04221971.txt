On Frew Street
Cillo Sustains 
Seri (Pits Injuries
A student was serious injured 
at 10 last Monday night during 
practice for this weekends buggy 
races.
Daniel Cillo, a junior in Chemi
cal Engineering, was driving the 
Delta Tau Delta buggy down Frew 
Street in back of the Hunt Library 
when it ran up the inclined curb at 
the end of the Baker Hall walk and 
hit a tree.
Security was called and L)an 
was taken to Shadyside Hospital 
in their ambulance. He remains 
there at this time. NTo statement 
has been made regarding his con
dition.
Dan has a twin brother, Dennis, 
who also attends Carnegie-Mellon.
The Presidents Security Policy 
Advisory Board met last Monday 
over a lunch of turkey sandwiches 
and made several recommenda
tions, including one of moving the 
Security Office into the Skibo 
space which may be vacated by 
the Placements Office.
Security Director Taylor favor
ed the recommendation because 
Skibo is the campus center. If Se
curity were in Skibo, there would 
be more student involvement 
with Security, he said, and the Se
curity Department would have 
quicker access to Mellon Institute.
Doug Campbell opposed the rec
ommendation on the grounds that 
Skibo is the student activity buildihg and at present cannot even 
supply enough space for students, 
let alone Security.
In other business, it was rec
ommended that Security switch 
to it* ew uniforms as soon as 
possible. The new uniforms are 
less traditional and are hoped to 
protect unarmed security officers 
from risk should they inadver
tantly walk in upon a robbery. In 
other words, they wont look like 
police and wont provoke a violent 
and dangerous reaction.
The Board also recommended 
that Warner Hall, Hammerschlag, Doherty, and Fine Arts be 
locked with the exception of one 
door and with the opening and 
closing times tailored to the use 
of the particular building.
A motion that a visable type of 
identification be worn by all au
thorized movers working on mov
ing equipment into Science Hall 
was passed and the administra
tion of this was placed upon Se
curity.
It was reported that as a result 
of a TARTAN article, Physical 
Plant is in the process of locking 
up the steam tunnels.
Another Board recommendation 
suggested that the administration 
take a complete inventory of the 
entire campus sometime in the 
near future.
And it was also recommended 
that the names and street ad
dresses o all buildings adjacent 
to or on public streets be placed 
conspicouslv on these buildings 
and that all buildings be clearly 
marked with their name. All of 
this is to aid in fire and police 
response.

In February of 1970, Security switched from reporting incidents as 
theft, C-MU property and theft, personal property to burglary, 
larceny and robbery. As a result of this change, it is difficult to assem
ble accurate comparative figures. That is why the statistics on assaults 
and robberies were combined in the above box. Previous to February 
of 70, most robberies were reported as assaults. For the statistics to 
have meaning, the following definitions are offered:
 a robbery is defined as being the felonius taking of ones property 
while being within his presence.
 a burglary is a theft that has resulted from breaking and entering.
 a larcency is a theft that occurred in an unlocked or unguarded area. 
(Stealing a painting off a wall at C-MU is larceny.)
The Dean of Students, Dean Swank, noted that the number of rob
beries and assaults had decreased. He suggested that this was due to 
the rescheduling of security guards. He also said that he was hoping 
that this new scheduling would result in further decreases in incidents

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Insect Editor 
Displays 
Ignorance
Editor:
Because the nature of your 
reply to my letter (April 15) 
was not historically inconsist
ant (i.e. it was quite predictable) 
with the replies given by those 
criticized for action or inaction 
on matters which they do not 
consider of high priority, I had 
decided to let the irrelevant re
marks that you had offered not 
really in a sincere apology but 
rather in a weak defense fester 
in their own irrelevancy and 
banality. However experienc 
has cautioned me that the con
sequences of ignorance, a force 
by which you were undoubtably 
guided in your remarks about 
SPIRIT, seek to undermine not 
only those about whom little 
or nothing is known, but also 
those who know little or noth
ing about others. I think it a 
vain effort to seek to undermine 
SPIRIT. And because I choose 
not to see you unconsciously 
undermining and being alienat
ed from yourself, I shall apprise 
you of several pieces of infor
mation, and constantly hope 
that you shall be more respon
sible in your efforts to retain 
them than you were in your 
efforts to obtain them (if any 
were made).
SPIRIT membership, con
trary to your statement and 
state of awareness, is open to 
any C-MU student and has two 
faculty advisors. SPIRIT addres
ses itself to those problems (edu
cational, social, cultural, etc. . .) 
that were created as a conse
quence of the prejudices of the 
ignorant and the ignorance of 
the blind in the white-supremacist history of the United States, 
and the ways in which those 
consequences can be over
come. The TARTAN, however, 
addresses itself to a somewhat 
more restrictive set of goals, 
and that rather more haphazard
lyThe SPIRIT symposium was 
publicized as open to all and 
suggested for all, and the qual
ity of attendance did not give 
evidence of any significant re
strictions. President Stever, 
Vice-President Schatz, Deans 
Swank, Milligan, and Williams, 
faculty members, GSIA stu
dents, foreign students, Gulf
Oil public relations men (in
cluding the vice-president), 
community personnel, and stu
dents from Duquesne, Chatham, 
Pitt, and C-MU were among 
those present, not to omit the 
distinguished speakers, includ
ing the first Somalian Ambas
sador to visit Pittsburgh and a 
Xhosa refugee from South 
Africa.
Like the TARTAN, SPIRITs 
membership is decided by in
terest and the willingness to 
work, its restrictions by apathy 
or a low-priority rating by an 
individual.
By harping on the member
ship issue, you undoubtedly 
sought a diversion from the 
central issue, for which you ex
tended a very superficial apol
ogy which even you didnt ac
cept. That issue was that you 
intentionally provided the entire 
symposium with non-coverage.
Again we reject the banal 
excuse of disorganization and 
preoccupation with re-organization. If this were true, a respon
sible editor would have appris
ed the SPIRIT leadership of 
this problem before or during 
the symposium. But you failed 
to apprise us of this problem 
even after the symposium. Fur
thermore, we all realize that 
over a period of four days at 
least one TARTAN staff mem
ber could have been found who 
had an hour free from the disor
ganization to cover one of the 
addresses, particularly the Am
bassadors address at 11:30 Tues
day (no-class hour). The arti
cle did not necessarily have to 
appear in that Thursdays TAR
TAN issue; the subsequent is
sue would not have been inap
propriate.
We all know that your ex
cuse is without substance, and 
the mere attempt by you to 
have us accept it is not only an 
insult to our intelligence but 
also a stigmatic reflection 
of your own.
We state again our conten
tion that had the SPIRIT sym
posium addressed itself to 
eliminating rather than edu
cating members of the campus 
community, it would have re
ceived first page, first column 
coverage in the first issue fol
lowing it, and in addition, you 
probably would have written an 
editorial on it, despite ail dis
organization and other preoc
cupations.
I also protest the fact that in 
my last letter the heading was 
changed from TARTAN BOY
COTTS SPIRIT to SPIRIT 
BOYCOTTED. I checked and 
found no space problem. I 
also noticed that the adjective 
freedom-loving/slaveholding 
was ostensibly omitted from 
its place in front of Thomas 
Jefferson.
You placed your foot in your 
mouth when you didnt cover 
the symposium. You placed your 
leg in your mouth when you 
tried to offer an irrelevant and 
ignorant response to our criti
cism. We hope you will not 
devour yourself any further.
Perhaps you should just ac
cept the fact that you acted ap
athetically and irresponsibly 
(we already have), and not at
tempt to provide a relevant 
response (other than tacit ack
nowledgement) for irresponsible 
behavior. Your responses are 
always predictable anyway, for 
we both know that from stagnant 
water we can expect only dead 
fish. However, as long as the 
TARTAN staff allows you to 
soar the Sky of Information like 
a graceful bird, you should re
frain from clipping your wings 
and crawling upon the Ground 
of Ignorance, like a disgusting 
insect.

H&SS--Dump
Editor:
The implications in the ar
ticle concerning the drop in 
applications for admission at 
CMU that humanities and liber
al arts are bullshit bothers me 
somewhat. Though something 
like history, being a progres
sive and therefore an experi
mentally nonreplicable pheno
menon, or Literature, being a 
necessarily interpretive and
inventive rather than a neces
sarily computative and possibly 
original phenomenon may at 
times seem more nebulous than 
pure science, certainly they
are ultimately neither less
real nor less important than 
physics, calculus, or any tech
nical subject. Certainly no one 
is so glib as to call it or its 
study bullshit. I do, however, 
understand how someone at 
CMU could come to say some
thing like this. One of CMUs 
most respected professors of 
psychology (psychology being 
a discipline of some confusion 
of loyalties and therefore cap
able of neutrality in a science 
vs. humanities battle) has ob

served that, Year after year 
this university turns out large 
numbers of very ignorant engin
eers. The reason has very like
ly been that the humanities 
courses tended to be pretty bullshitty. Where we now have 
courses like Thermodynamics 
for Non-thermodynamicists (i.e. 
Physics for Poets) and Funda
mentals of Math I (Mathe
matics for Idiots), we have 
always had and still have the 
reverse, that is Humanities for 
Nurds, and the quality of the 
humanities courses continues to 
reflect this. Whats more, now 
that the school offers degrees 
in humanities, liberal arts de
partments have become a dump
ing ground for nurds who did
nt make it. They are generally 
pnenthusiastic about their new
ly found discipline of expedi
ence and do not tend to raise 
the level of the departments 
into which they transfer. This 
is an interesting contrast in a 
school whose Fine Arts depart
ment denies even access to in
dividual classes to outsiders. 
Where would a flunking H&SS 
student who wanted to trans
fer to Drama be? Is the H&SS 
school so desperate that it really 
wants to take just anyone, or is 
it just too young and weak to 
stand up to its richer and more 
powerful opponents?
I have no bones to pick with 
the physicists or mathematicians 
or engineers. However, I feel 
that the situation at CMU is 
such that they indirectly and 
unintentionally contribute to the 
relatively low quality of liberal 
arts studies, then manifest an 
elitest attitude against it, only 
further worsening the situation. 
Thus we have a self-fulfilling 
prophecy and what is consider
ed to be bullshit developes all 
the qualities of bullshit.
I do hope that someday soon 
the humanities courses here will 
improve, though the prospects 
seem so dim that many H&SS 
students, myself included, are 
attempting to transfer. The 
H&SS department, which, ac
cording to the TARTAN, Presi
dent Stever considers success
ful, was not stillborn, but it 
may still die in infancy.

Author's note: goddamn right!
Future Crisis
Editor:
This is a letter of appreciation 
directed to those Administrators 
who make pre-registration pos
sible. Leave it to them to come 
up with a method to unite the 
students, to gather half of every
one on campus together in one 
spot at one time. No rally or 
demonstration has ever brought 
forth more people. No activity 
has entertained so many for so 
long.
To those motorists driving by, 
staring at the mammoth snak
ing line of people waiting to 
enter the gym, Im sure that 
it seemed like a mass demonstra
tion (a stand-in) was taking 
place. Perhaps a movement for 
more student control of the uni
versity, perhaps a march to sup
port the workers. Im certain 
those motorists drove away with 
the feeling that C-MU just 
might be a real university and 
not a melting pot of conformity. 
The administrators have help
ed our image, at least in the 
eyes of those passers-by. I thank 
them.
Yes, pre-registration was a 
wonderful new experience this 
year. Never before have I had 
the pleasure of spending three 
hours in a more enjoyable group
project. I encourage the Activi
ties Board to consider sponsor
ing several of these events next 
year. Not only are they unusual 
in character but they both pro
vide that bit of physical exer
cise that we are all lacking and 
they are inherently educational 
A group of us stood talking in 
the psychology linereally the 
psychology mob, since we were V 
five of six abreast, moved 
about two feet per half hour, 
and were lined the length of the 
gymand we noted that only 
Carnegie-Mellon would have 
the forethought to provide in
struction in the Future Over 
population Crisis in such a dra
matic Manner. We could easily 
envision life in the year 2,000 
when we would spend our en- * 
tire life trying to get from one 
end of the room to the other.
Congratulations to whoever 
is responsible for this.

Cut - Dump
Editor, The Tartan:
The student body at CarnegieMellon University proudly an
nounces the creation of a new 
open dump. Developed by stu
dents in recognition of the seri
ous ecology problem that exists 
in the world today, this dump 
is located on the area formerly 
known as the cut. Daily we > 
bring as much garbage to the 
dump as possible (often skipping 
classes). We invite all to do like
wise and further the cause. As 
might be expected however, 
the University, feigning a budget 
squeeze, throws away money 
attempting to prevent the dump 
from being a success. With 
everybodys help though, we 
shall overcome! +

Senate Notes
The highlight of the Student Senate meeting on Tuesday was the 
presentation of the proposed budget for 1971-72 by President Stev
er. In accordance with Student Senates request, President Stever ad
dressed the Senate and entertained questions on this matter.
The budget, which was outlined in last weeks TARTAN, was ap
proved with reservations by the Trustees on Monday, April 19. The 
Trustees wanted to cut the present deficit to one million dollars. In the 
proposed budget, the deficit will be two million dollars.
Stever stated that there is a tradition of deficits in the history of 
the University, but that this deficit must be kept within certain bounds. 
The income dropped unexpectedly this year due to less revenue from 
tuition and fees and fewer gifts from outside the university commun
ity due to unfavorable attitudes toward that community which have 
developed becuase of campus unrest. Stever proposed that if we had 
decided to continue to run the university on that basis, that is, if we 
had paid for normal raises and had kept tlie same number of em
ployees, we would have a deficit of five to six million dollars.
Because most of the budget in an academic institution is compris
ed of salaries and wages (70 per cent) efforts were made to effect a 
slight reduction in this area. There will be a net drop of approximately 
23 faculty members, 28 instructors and student helpers, 15 administra
tors, 31 skilled help and 20 clerical workers.
Stever emphatically stated that he is optimistic about the Univer
sitys stability. He noted that with the proposed budget, no changes 
were made in the nature of the University, that is, no departments 
will be phased out as a result of the proposed budget.
Current problems facing the University lie in two areas. The 
first, and perhaps the hardest to control, is the uncertainty of future 
enrollment and accompanying revenue. Also, our ability to operate 
efficiently with the proposed cuts in the size of the staff is ques
tionable.
President Stever entertained questions upon completion of his 
presentation.
Shortly after the budget presentation, a senator called for a 
quorum. Because two-thirds of the senators were not present the 
meeting was adjourned.

Child Care Center
by DEBBIE HOLDSTEIN
Through the diligent efforts of the Women of Carnegie Mellon 
Child Care Committee, a long-overdue Child Care Center for chil
dren of faculty, staff and students will bd opened on the C-MU campus 
in September, 1971. It will fill an obvious need of women (and men) of 
all positions here at C-MU who will now be able to pursue their respec
tive roles in education or careers where child care problems would 
ordinarily have prevented such endeavors.
The C-MU Child Care Center will be an innovative prototype for 
other centers of this kind that will be opening around the country. Its 
unique nature lies in the approach to child carethe work will empha
size individualized discovery as an integral part of the educational 
program, with children of ages ranging from two months to five years 
as those to participate and benefit from the program. The flexibility of 
the program will enable its change as research indicates this need.
A survey concerning the new Child Care Center will be mailed to all 
married staff, faculty and students. It is requested that this survey be 
returned as soon as possible due to the importance of the mailing in 
the establishment and function of the Center.
Those who do not receive this survey or who wish additional in
formation about the Center are asked to call Dr. Helene Borke, 521- 
7998, or Mrs. Martha Birnbaum, 687-1375. This information is 
also available by writing to the Women of Carnegie-Mellon, Box 26, 
Campus Mail. *
The Child Care Center will be opening for all those in the C-MU 
population who need this valuable service. It will be of immeasurable 
benefit to both the parents who need this fine facility for their chil
dren, as well as the youngsters themselves.

In his film LITTLE BIG MAN, 
Arthur Penn presents a sympa
thetic look at that time in his
tory when the American Indian 
found himself a liability to pro
gress because he stood in the 
way of an expanding frontier. 
Since the Indian was a threat 
to the settlers who were, after 
all, taking over his land, he had 
to be subdued and controlled. In 
charge of controlling the savage 
barbarians were cavalry officers 
such as General George Custer 
who mistook his peace keeping 
duties as a license to commit 
genocide.
Penn portrays the Indians as 
being a courageous, noble people 
with a highly civilized manner of 
living. There are no Ugh, or 
How, lines in Penns film. His 
Indians are not simple or inane, 
rather they hrve a dignity about 
them, and desire to be left to 
live in peace.
The story of LITTLE BIG 
MAN is told in one long flash
back by one hundred and twentyone year old Jack Crabb who at 
the age of ten was adopted by 
the Cheyanne when his mother 
and father were killed in a raid 
on their wagon by another tribe. 
The story then proceeds to jump
Here come the meek to inherit the earth!
The uneducatedto fill our 
schools. The unemployed 
to take over key jobs. The 
unfedto eat their share of 
our bread. The underhoused

mankind has never exj>erienced l>efore will l>e your lot. 
Quakers think all men have 
something of God in them. 
Therefore change which 
allows each individual to 
share the human experience 
more fully is a blessed thing. 
Isnt this what the meek 
really have to inherit?

GENERAL' 
CONFERENCE \
back and forth between Jacks 
adventures with the Cheyenne, 
and his different stages in the 
civilized world of the white 
man. The film continues in this 
manner with Jack bouncing back 
and forth between the two life 
styles with maddening regularity 
until just after Custers last stand 
when he walks off with his adopt
ed Indian grandfather, Old Lodge 
Skins, into a wide-screen panor
ama.
The main weakness in the film 
is the result of this bouncing 
back and forth between two cul
tures. Perhaps screenwriter Calder Willingham intended this to 
serve as a contrast between the 
two with the Indians coming out 
more favorably. Whatever his 
intentions were, this technique 
serves only to retard action in the 
plot while hindering character 
development. Willinghams adap
tation of Thomas Bergers nov
el tries to accomplish too much 
in the space of one hundred 
and thirty-nine minutes, and it 
winds up not treating anything 
sufficiently. The focal point of 
his story is even in doubt: Crabb 
begins talking about his know
ledge of the American Indian 
with an interviewer in his hos
pital room, and winds up telling 
much more about his own incre
dible adventures then he does 
about the Indian. In fact, it is 
only at the end of the film that 
audience is reminded of what 
the main thrust of the story is 
supposedly about.
Arthur Penn tries masterfully 
in his direction to overcome the 
flaws in the screenplay, and, at 
least in part, succeeds. He has 
excellently handled the scenes 
involving Jack Crabb and his 
friendship with the Indians. 
These are in fact, the best se
quences in the film, and one can 
only wish that they were longer 
and more fully drawn. The gen
uine humor, warmth, and com
passion which runs through these 
scenes makes the rest of the film 
appear contrived by comparison.
Penn appears to have had very 
little success with the scenes in 
the film which deal with Jacks 
adventures in the white mans 
civilization. Admittedly there is 
humor in these sequences, but 
the characters involved in them 
(with the exception of General 
Custer) seldom become develop
ed enough to attain three dimen
sions, and yet these characters 
keep reocurring with such mad
dening regularity that they are 
obviously intended to convey 
some message of importance

In GSIA
by JON MANON
Frustrated by the barren aspect 
of the Graduate School of Indus
trial Administrations lobby, Miss 
Joan Velar, GSIA receptionist, 
decided that something must be 
obtained to fill the void. And so 
during the past fall semester she 
endeavored on several occasions 
to convince C-MU fine arts stu
dents to exhibit their works at 
GSIA. However Miss Velar met 
with no positive response until 
she enlisted the support of Mr. 
Wesley A. Mills, the Assistant 
Head of the Department of 
Painting and Sculpture. Under 
his gracious advisement she suc
ceeded in convincing students 
that the GSIA anteroom was not 
only an appropriate vehicle for 
artistic display, but was also a 
location of minimum security 
risk.
January witnessed the first of 
the displays, which have been 
successfully continued, altering 
artists and contents once a month. 
Currently, lasting through April 
30th, paintings by Susan Manns, 
ceramics by Ken Surdick, and 
glass and aluminum castings by 
John Franchione populate the 
GSIA gallery which has been 
extended to envelop any and all

other than Its a small frontier. 
Perhaps these episodes were only 
intended to be peripherial events. 
If this is the case, then Penns 
handling of them is all the more 
regrettable for they seem to have 
gotten beyond his control, yet it 
is definitely to his credit that he 
does not permit them to over
whelm his vehicle.
In LITTLE BIG MAN, as in 
THE CHASE, and BONNIE AND 
CLYDE, Penn once again con
fronts violence. While it is not 
the focal point of his story, he 
does not shrink away from treat
ing it realistically. To his credit, 
Penn does not get carried away 
with the shock value of blood
shed. Naturally, when someone 
is shot in his films they do bleed, 
and the massacres of the Indians 
and Custers troops are very rea
listic, but thankfully they never 
reach the carnage-for-goressake nadir that such scenes did 
in SOLDIER BLUE.Dustin Hoffman stars in the 
picture as Jack Crabb. Hoffmans
role is a difficult one calling

art objects on display are poten
tially for sale and Miss Velar, 
who has the price lists at her 
desk, notes that quite a few items

through the lobby and the ar

is also pleased to report that 
there has been no vandalism of

attributes this spotless safety re

(she can spy most of the dis

to bring it off. The scope of his

Spirit Holds 
Play Together
by MARC ELLIOT FIELD
The fact that David Spangler 
has no business writing for a 
college should be obvious to 
everyone by now. Yet I am 
sure that Scotch and Soda 
thank their lucky stars that they 
have him. Once again he has 
proven himself to be a fine 
writer. Together with Mark 
Pirolo he has put together a 
show worth seeing.
The best quality that Scotch 
and Soda brings to the produc
tion is not their acting, nor 
their singingrather their spirit. 
That is the key to the success 
of the show. The show is an ex
perience, a feeling that can be 
best summed up in the title 
of one of the songs, Everybody 
Needs Love. This is definitely 
a fun show: for the cast and 
the audience.
FESTIVAL is loosly based on 
the Orpheus myth and set in 
modern time. The action of the 
play takes place at a rock festi
val.
Devin Goldenberg is convinc
ing as Orpheus a rock singer 
who falls in love with, then 
loses, Eurydice (Debbie Segal). 
Both of them are right for the 
parts. Stephan Fechtor plays 
Jason and his strong voice does 
much to enhance the show. 
Thracia (Carrie OBrien) is the 
manager of Orpheus and Jason 
and her singing is a high point.
The play opens with the set
ting up of the festival and the 
place bears a strong similarity 
to Woodstock with its many tow
ers and levels. Mark Pirolos 
set is perfect for the show and 
the movable stage is the best 
touch though a bit overused. 
The slides that he has employed 
are especially well done and 
they work nicely.
Debbie and Devin give the 
best performances in the show, 
yet the best all-round perfor
mance was by the troupe. They 
did a magnificant job of work
ing together and their spirit 
never lagged.

act are the songs Less Har
monica by Less Moreorless, 
Dont Let The Music Stop, 
Carole Kalinski singing San 
Francisco Morning, After the 
Rainfall sung by Debbie Segal 
and the musical highlight of 
the show Everybody Needs 
Love. Yet songs such as Rain 
needed cutting because they 
unnecessarily dragged out the 
act.
In the second act Orpheus 
vainly tries to return a freaked 
out Eurydice to reality until 
he, too, is lost. The mood val
ue of the second act was so 
powerful that the audience did 
not applaud after any of the 
musical numbers, for fear of 
shattering the dramatic illusion. 
Here the play changed its tact 
and moves towards heavy tra
gedy. The problem of this act 
was that it dragged, since most 
of the plot advancements were 
repititious and the rhythms 
were monotonous. There was a 
slight break in the form of one 
song, Freedom Song by Ca
role Kalinski, which did much 
to change the tempo of the 
act.
The main fault of the show 
was with the bookit was un
necessary. I strongly feel the 
show should have been a rock 
opera. The music is the best 
element of the show, the dia
logue stiff by comparison. The 
only thing that saved most of 
the dialogue was the insertion 
of a dirty joke in each scene. 
The books failing could also be 
seen in terms of the staging. 
The direction of the musical
The high points of the first numbers was suberb. The few
literary magazine 
to be issued here
dialogue scenes dragged and 
were unfocused. Many people 
in the audience did not see 
Eurydice pop the pills at the 
end of the first act. For the 
most part, the staging that 
advanced what plot there was 
proved to be muddled. Thus 
could be seen in the ending. 
Although it was powerful, it 
was unspecific, and most of the 
audience was not aware of the 
fact that the show had ended. 
The reason for this is two
fold, the shortcomings in the 
writing of the book, and David 
Spanglers lack of knowledge of 
directing fundamentals.
Despite all of this, the finale 
of the show was beautiful. It 
brought the audience back to 
reality and kept the power of 
the meggage of the show at the 
same time.
When all is said and done the 
Scotch and Soda production of 
FESTIVAL is a good show for 
which all concerned are to be 
congratulated. It is worth seeing 
for the spirit and good feeling 
generated by the cast if nothing 
else. I do recommend that you 
get tickets and see FESTIVAL.

magazine seeks to present an 
artistic potpourri of the best

the gamut from fiction, poetry, 
graphic design, photography, 
and social comment. To suit the 
excellence of the work within, 
we have selected high quality

DANCE KID is the first motion 
picture ever produced about the 
exploits of the true-life charac
ters, although they were the 
last of the famed bad men 
to come out of the Old West.
It tells the true story of the 
fast-draws and wild rides, 
battles with posses, train and 
bank roberies, a torrid love af
fair and a new lease on out
law life in far away Bolivia. 
It is also a character study of 
a remarkable friendship be
tween Butch possibly the most 
likeable outlaw in frontier his
tory, and his colsest associate, 
the fabled ever-dangerous, Sun
dance Kid.
Two of the most sought after 
actors appear in the Cinema

Cassidy and Robert Redford 
plays the kid, while Katherine 
Ross is seen as the hot-blooded

Then the students give way to 
a game that they cant possibly 
lose, as faculty are pitted against 
faculty in the wild and woolly 
Faculty Egg Toss.
Its the girls turn next, tor an
other try at the sorority relays. 
Some really strange races are 
planned this year, but we prom
ise fun for all, whether partici
pating or just watching.
The IM Fields to be the scene 
of another debut as kitists of CMU converge to compete for hon
ors in a Kite-Flying Contest..
On another part of the field, 
the Carnival Picnic will be go
ing on, with volleyball, dodge 
ball, three-legged races, refresh
ments served by Dr. Stever, and a 
really big surprise for all..
FRIDAY EVENING - Sock Ilop,
Hootenanny/
The first evening of indoor 
entertainment comes to you in the 
Morewood rec room, as Carni
val Committee presents a sock 
hop. Actually, you neednt wor
ry about learning to jitterbug,
cuz well have a modern group 
playing for the dance, but noth
ings to keep you from dancing 
in your socks, a la the Fiftees, 
and we think youll dig the crazy 
crepe-paper decorations were 
putting up..
For those whos rather stomp 
their feet while sitting down, 
theres a Hootenanny planned 
in the Staff Cafeteria. Therell 
be a lot of local entertainers 
on hand to lead you through a 
real hand clapping, knee slap
ping, foot stomping affair.. 
SATURDAY MORNING - Bug
gies, Football/
Saturday morning will find a 
tense group over at the Schenley 
course to view the finals competi
tion of the Carnival Sweepstakes. 
Shortly afterward, the Tech 
Bowl becomes the scene of the 
bone-crunching Alumni-Varsity 
Football Game, an annual event 
that gives former Tartans a 
chance to show the young whippersnappers how to play the 
game..
The early afternoon hours will 
find a nervous bunch gathered 
in the C-MU gym for the flyoffs of entries in the Paper Air
plane contest. There are some 
good designs popping up  but 
anyone can enter, so try your own 
hand at flight origami.. 
SATURDAY EVENING - BB
King, Awards/
8:30 at the Carnegie Music 
Hall, B. B. King in Concert! 
And just to add to the excite
ment sparked by B. B.s hot 
guitar picking fingers, the 
awards for all Carnival Compe
tition will be announced during 
intermission..
This year, the Spring Carnival Committee, in an attempt }to broad
en the scope of interest in Carnival Weekend has initiated several 
new events. It is hoped that members of the C-MU community who 
previously felt left out of it, (or those that didnt, too) will be 
able to participate, particularly as individuals or small teams. EV
ERYBODY is eligiblestudents, faculty and workers..
The First Annual Frisbee Tournament will take place on the 
Cut at 1:00 Friday afternoon, April 23. The only necessary require
ment is a willingness to get out there and test your skill youve been 
developing all those sunny (?) afternoons. There will be two classes >)
of competition: Individual  each entrant will compete in the
categories of Distance and Accuracy (this involves a bit of preci
sion), and Team Competition  this takes two teams, each having 
five players, who alternate throwing the Frisbee at each other and 
keeping in mind the rules and regulations set by the National Organization of Frisbee Championships (honestly!). The winners re
ceive, besides glory, self-satisfaction, and all that  nice new tro
phies, too..
The Paper Airplane Contest is also a new attraction. There will 
be two general types of competition: Designemphasizing compe- .
tence of the builder in defining his objective (flying?), solving *
difficulties and his aesthetic results, and Performancewhich conacrobatics. Materials are limited to paper, Scotch magic tape, white 
glue, weights (cargo capacity only). Self-propulsion is unallowable 
(only wind!). Two (different designs) per category per person or 
group. Theres a small incentive for contestants heresix $25.00 Sav
ings Bonds..
The Kite Competition which takes place on the I.M. Field, is 
also divided into two categories: The requirements are pertty bas
icone must build a kite that flies well and uses wind as its only 
propulsion. Materials are currently available at the Information Desk. ' 
Two $25.00 Savings Bonds will be awarded in this contest..
Although a background in engineering should not be detrimen
tal to success, it is by no means mandatory, as originality of ideas 
and design will be of prime importance..

able at the Skibo Information Desk. In case there are questions or

MIDWAY thru the 50's
New Years Day, 1950, will 
come at 4:30 p.m., Thursday, 
April 22. On hand to welcome 
in the new decade will be 
Your Fathers Mustache, world 
famous comedians and honkytonk musicians as the C-MU Mid
way is opened for the first time. 
That gang of people Cruisin 
from booth to booth, by the way, 
is the distinguished panel of 
judges making the first of their 
two visits to each of the Fifties 
Memorabilia. The other visit 
will come later that evening 
when daylight fades and the 
lights are turned on. Join us now 
as we ourselves go cruisin 
down the Midway..
ATO: This year ATOs entry 
to the Midway, Mix N Match 
will present a backwards look 
into the music of the fabulous 
fifties. The booth will be com
pletely equipped with Juke-box, 
top ten list, theater marquee, and 
giant rotating poster segments. 
The players mission, should he 
choose to accept it is to manipu
late the fabulous fifties juke
box such that the correct record 
enters the corresponding slot in 
the machine. For each correct 
choice of the slot in the juke
box, a segment of the giant pos
ter will stop rotating, thus en
abling the skillful player to stop 
all the segments in the proper 
positions to form a picture of 
Elvis or Pat Boon. Presiding 
over the whole booth will be a 
giant theater marquee inviting 
all to play ATOs Mix N Match..
BETA SIGMA RHO: Those 
zany madcap sadomasochists 
at Beta Sig are at it again. This 
time theyre out to blow the 
world and your mind with the 
new, improved Beta Sig Beat 
the Bomb game, played in the 
inner sanctum of their deluxe 
model 3340 H-bomb. Dont miss 
the merry madcap mirth of 
the mass murderers. Join in the 
fun. (Endorsed by the Federal 
Union of Crazed Killers.).
BETA THETA PI: One out
standing facet of the Fifties was 
the long running television 
series starring Fes Parker and the 
consdquent Davy Crockett Craze. 
Beta Theta Pis booth this year 
will be a return to the days of 
this frontiersman. The booth 
will feature Dunka Beta in 
an. attempt to give the Mid
way the carnival atmosphere it 
has been missing the last two 
years..
COMMUTER CLUB: Joe
McCarthy lives! Yes concern
ed citizens, come one come all, 
to the fabulous world of the 
Fifties in the Commuter Clubs 
booth: Kill A Commie For
Mommy. Be the first one to 
make those Russskis eat death! 
You must be quick, though, 
those Commies are every

Delta Gamma is proud to wel 
come that adorable and talented
monster of the Fifties, devour
ing his way into your hearts, 
the One-eyed, One-horned, Fly
ing, Purple People Eater..
DELTA UPSILON: Last
years most exciting booth re
turns to the 71 Midway as DU 
resurrects Skibo Sally. (We 
would have resurrected Frank 
Korbett, but its already been 
done.) For those who dont 
remember, Skibo Sally is an en
ormous slingshot, which flings 
water baiioons at suspecting 
target, some feel that bringing 
back Skibo Sally for another 
Carnival is stretching a point, 
but we feel that the booth will 
bounce back successfully. In 
keeping with the theme for this 
year, our targets will be char
acters from the 50s: Elvis 
Berbari; James C. (for Chuch) 
Barrie; meek, mild-mannered 
Clark Kent Craig, and many 
more. So take out your frustra
tions and psychopathic tenden
cies at the DU booth. You will 
definitely make a big splash..
KAPPA ALPHA THETA: You 
dont need coordination or 
skill at the Thetas Spring Car 
nival booth. Just be uninhibit
ed. Come reminisce and use 
those old muscles you forgot 
you had as you Hula Hoop your 
way down memory lane..
KAPPA SIGMA: Kappa Sig
mas booth for the 1971 Carnival 
is truly a booth of the 50s. 
Its design, with full roof, col
umns and ornamentations, harkens to the prize winning Kappa 
Sig booth of the Fifties. The 
game will be our time honored 
Nickel Pitch, brought out of 
moth balls specially because of 
its grat populatity way back 
when. The final element of our 
Carnegie Tech is the old 
gung-ho Kappa Sig Spirit, 
still going since God knows 
when..
PHI KAPPA THETA: Look
for the mountain on the Mid
waythere you will find 
Kap in the Wonderful World of 
Disney. Relive your childhood 
dream of visiting Disneyland 
while playing the ever-popular 
ball game, this year with a 
brand new image added. Gaze 
in wonderment as the most popu
lar ride of Disneyland, the Mat
terhorn, soars into the coulds. 
Let the total environment of the 
Phi Cap booth carry you off to 
the magical land of Disney..
SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON: 
Its stupendous, its colossal. 
Youll be bombarded by a fabu
lous barrage of light, color and 
music. It slows; it spins; it sings 
before your very eyes. Step 
into it. Youve stepped into 
Americas teenage passion: THE 
JUKE BOX. Up youll ascend, 
far above the height of any 
ordinary man. From your vant
age point youll see allthe Mid
way, its color, its excitement, 
its drama. You are a part of itit is 1950. Press the buttons, 
ride the needle, thrill at the ex
citement of riding over records 
by great stars like: Elvis Pres
ley and Bill Haley and the 
Comets. You are there, you are 
a part of it, you are the great 
American youth machine, SAEs 
JUKE BOX..
SIGMA NU: In the 1950s a 
movement began that eventu
ally swallowed the entire world. 
Rock N Roll became its name. 
And its valiant leader was
the one and only Elvis Presley. 
His pelvic gyrations captured 
the eye of man and woman 
alike. Now, Sigma Nu gives you 
the chance of a life time to lay 
your amazed eyes on ELVIS 
PELVIS. We aske you the 
question, Can you match and 
conque the skill of Elvis 
pelvic gyration? Come and find 
out for yourself..
TAU DELTA PHI: Again this 
year, Tau Delt will wheel out 
its erector set which combined 
with a new booth secret will 
make CHAIN REACTION one 
of the truely unique creations 
on the Midway. In this design, 
Tau Delt presents one of forward-looking facets of the Fif
tiesnuclear power generation. 
So practice jour atom splitting 
technique and be prepared..
THETA XI+ Theta Xis trip 
into the 50s involves the U.S. 
submarine Nautilous with you as 
her captain to guide your craft 
through treacherous icebergs 
to reach the North Pole. The 
three players traverse the gang 
plank entering the ships con
ning tower, taking positions 
in front of periscopes. The 
winner of the game is the con
testant who arrives at the North 
Pole first, using his navigational 
skills.
Enuf to Drive You Buggy
The buggy races this year 
should prove, as every year, to 
be the highlight of the Spring 
Carnival Weekend. The races 
are run on two days:ten pre
liminary heats consisting of 
three buggies each are run on 
Friday. The best of three times 
from Friday qualify for the 
finals on Saturday. The next 
three best times are placed in 
the consolation heat, also on 
Saturday. Racing begins at
9 a.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. on 
Saturday..
The two most important fac
tors in the race are the push 
team and the buggy. Both a fast 
push team and a fast buggy are 
needed to win. There is much 
debate as to what actually makes 
a fast buggy. There are many

theories on this matter, most oi 
which center around the weight 
of the buggy and the wheels 
and bearings. It seems the latest 
trend is toward lightness which 
can optimize the advantages of a 
fast free roll and pushing ease. 
Pushing ease is the principle 
advantage of the bicycle style 
racers, the bikes, however, roll 
slower in the free-roll phase 
of the race* Exotic bearings and 
the smell of burnt rubber are 
trade marks of many buggies, as 
some feel that heating the wheels 
can improve free roll times. 
Most Speed techniques are 
confidential and are classified as 
Buggy secrets. This adds to 
the excitement of the races and 
emphasizes the competitive
ness of the race.

all these mathematics of hyper

necessary? This is a question 
only the reader can answer deep 
within himself, as he stands in 
an 800-foot line waiting to preregister for courses so unorgan
ized as to stagger the imagina
tion of any Ernie Bushmiller.
Pre-registration was designed, 
I suppose, to alleviate some 
of the hectic rushing-around of 
registration. The system in use 
now, however, has placed even 
more strain on the students and 
the staff members helping the 
pre-registration. This semesters 
affair makes C-MUs other at
tempts at the same problem look 
one hundred percent efficient. 
Little did the Registrars office 
realize, as it printed up the 
infamous class list sheets, 
that such a night mare would 
occur.

the part of the workers as to 
what to do, confusion on the 
part of the students as to what 
they should do when they find 
a filled course, confusion on 
the part of Bill Burns, who 
may sue me for libel. In one 
case, one of the helpers show
ed up 45 minutes late; by the 
time he arrived, the line in 
front of his desk extended in 
threefold clear across the gym
nasium floor. After all this, he 
finally comes up with the 
statement, I want everybody to 
form into a funnel. . . everyone 
move out. . . I only want one 
person in front of me at a time. 
I wish I could make a verbatim 
quote on thatthats the best I 
can remember it. Another work
er came without the class lists 
and disappeared for ten min
utes, then reappeared for a sec
ond and left again. When he 
finally did stay for good, he 
had to label all the class lists, 
course number, section, and 
all, which took up not a few 
minutes. In several instances, 
students were placed in the 
wrong sections by the helpers, 
who had to be re-instructed 
after the mistake was realized 
by the student.
I have actually been unfair 
to the registering staff so far; 
it is not entirely their faults 
(although somewhat more pre
paration could have been call
ed for). The real problem lies 
in the unfamiliarity of this
new, improved, inefficient bog. 
(Clip this article out and sent 
it to your mom.)
Already, C-MU has tried the 
pick up all sorts of cards sys
tem, which was in itself con
fusing, and now, to eliminate 
the cards, instigated the sign 
all sorts of sheets system. 
Neither is good, neither saves 
time, neither would be admired 
by a visiting college registrar. 
I have had an idea for quite 
a few months (lingering case). 
I would appreciate knowing why 
it would not be possible for 
the following system to be prac
ticed:
1. The student would have his 
schedule approved the week be
fore registration, or pre-registration, as it stands now.
2. The student would then, at 
registration period (lasting an 
entire day, from 9 to 7), show 
his schedule to the respective 
desks where his courses are cen
tered. Punch cards would be 
neatly arranged on the table,MAY DAY
Time is running out. New developments in Vietnam over the 
past year make the Peoples Peace Treaty and the demonstrations 
planned for April 24-May 5 very significant for Americans who 
are against the war.
In Vietnam, the United States is fighting against what is known 
as a Peoples War. A Peoples war is one in which the guerillas are 
housed, clothed, fed, ahd have secrets kept by the people in the 
countryside. This relationship of an army to the people can only 
come about when the goals of the army represent the feelings of 
the people they claim to be fighting for. The Vietnamese have a 
long history of fighting outside invaders (most recently the French 
and the Japanese). To them, the U.S. is another in a long line of in
vaders. It should be noted the Thieu and Ky and other members of 
their regime fought on the side of the French colonialists.
In order for the U. S. and its puppet troops to try to win a mili
tary victory, they have tried to separate the guerillas from the 
people. This has meant:
1. Massive bombing of the countryside of Vietnam, Laos and 
Cambodia. The equivalent of 2Vfe Hiroshima is dropped on Vietnam 
every week.
2. Defoliation of large portions of the countryside with chemi
cal weapons. 12 percent of the arable land has been destroyed by 
bombing and defoliation. Now, many women are having deformed 
babies at an alarming rate which THREATEN FUTURE GENERA
TIONS. It is known that the amount of cell damage caused by these 
chemicals is SIX times that which caused babies to be deformed as 
a result of the atom bomb in Hiroshima. The final consequences on 
the people and land of Vietnam caused by defoliation is unknown 
but who can wait?
3. Making refugees of large parts of the population through
forced urbanizationPacification. Recently hundreds of thousands 
of Vietnamese were to be removed from the I Corps area just
south of the demilitarized zonean area where the U. S. might
use nuclear weapons.
Despite all this the U. S. is far away from a military victory 
as it ever was. The U. S. government CAN NOT win the war but 
it CAN continue to slaughter the people and destroy the land.
The combination of large numbers of people being forced into 
the cities and galloping inflation and the seriousness of the continu
ed destruction of the country has caused the growth of a very large 
non-Vietcong affiliated peace movement in the cities of South
non-Vietcong affiliated peace movement in the cities of South
Vietnam. Thd peace movement includes religious groups, womens 
groups, students, ARVN veterans, intellectuals, journalists and mem
bers of the National Assembly. The demands of the people in the 
South Vietnamese peace movement for immediate U. S. withdrawal 
a coalition government, and the ouster of Thieu and Ky are illegal 
under existing laws. But despite the fact that his peace movement 
has been met with heavy repression, the movement continues to 
grow. It is important to note that the different peace demands put 
forth by the South Vietnamese peace movement are very similar to 
the demands of the provisional Revolutionary Government (Vietcong) and the North Vietnamese are embodied in the Peoples Peace 
Treaty.
As the people continue to speak out for peace in South Vietnam 
the repression will increase. This has not stopped the Vietnamese. 
That does not mean, however, that we in the American peace move
ment can set back and wait because what we do in coordination 
with the Vietnamese (Mayday) will make a difference.
according to course and section. 
The student would simply pick 
up the cards corresponding to 
his classes, and proceed. First 
come, first served. When all 
cards in any section are gone 
the class is full.
3. The student then takes his 
cards to any desk in Thistle 
Hall, and lets the people there 
to sort them out. The work in 
registration shouldnt have to be 
relegated to those registering. 
If the workers arfe informed of 
the processes involved in regis
tration, there is no reason why 
some of the confusion and work 
cannot be taken off the students 
back.
4. Classes would be cancelled 
the day of pre-registration. This 
would make many more people 
available than usual and would 
be of more convenience to the 
student as well. This year, one 
had basically the alternative of 
missing a meal or being shut 
out of a class.
Of course, this process is 
riddled with C-MU efficiency. 
It would be so heart-warming 
to see something done with 
no wasted effort around here. 
Pipe dreams return. Ideas re
main ideas.
Some people would manage 
to screw up any system, 
though. As I stood in line, I 
saw two students arguing over 
which of them was before the 
other, using you were behind 
him, and he was behind me 
logic. Just then, one of those 
students was approached by a 
girl who gave him a few sche
dule cards and said, Well, I 
signed you up for these two 
courses. . . heres your cards 
back. . .. And junior high
school teachers try to instill in 
their students the concept of 
the Honor System.

Student Film Festivtd: 
Enjoyable Endurance Contest
by TERENCE N. PALSO
The Second Annual CarnegieMellon Student Film Festival 
came off last weekend without 
any hitches greater than a few 
pulled plugs and some film which 
refused to remain on its reels. 
For the audience the program 
proved to be a fairly enjoyable 
endurance contest, as the hardy 
souls who stayed for the three 
programs which were presented 
at each showing, saw a total of 
twenty-one films in a time of 
somewhere around three hours.
The films submitted were in
dependently made by CMU stu
dents, and, as a result, contained 
many of the flaws which a lack 
of financial backing and/or ex
perience presents to the devoted 
filmmaker who sets out to pre
sent his personal vision of his 
environment through the lens of
a Super-8 camera. While most 
of the films were in need of 
editing and direction, and sev
eral were so personal, and avantgarde that they were comprehen
sible only to their creators and 
their close friends, there were 
still several pictures shown which 
more than made the evenings 
expenditure of time worth while 
for this writer.
The number of films shown 
makes any sort of critical com
ment virtually impossible as this 
writer simply does not have the 
time, space, energy, or memory 
needed to thoughtfully examine 
the large number of works pre
sented. However, he would like 
to mention the titles and makers 
of those pictures which he felt 
to be the best efforts exhibited:

The films above are listed in 
the order in which they were 
shown. The appearence of a film 
on this list does not mean that 
this writer regards it as being 
technically perfect or emotional
ly carthartic, he merely in
tends to say that he found these 
to be the most original and in
triguing of those shown.
A film festival such as the one 
given last weekend presents the 
campus film makers with need
ed exposure, and also gives them 
the opportunity to see how their 
efforts are accepted and appre
ciated by audiences. To stimu
late the creativity evidenced last 
weekend the festival should di
vide films into categories, and 
then offer cash prizes for the 
three best films in each cate
gory. The prizes do not have to 
be tremendous, for even awards 
of say $25, $15, and $10 would be 
welcomed. To publicize the win
ners, a local television station 
could no doubt be persuaded to 
air the winning works and inter
view the creators. Perhaps, in 
time, a city-wide festival involv
ing films made by students at the 
other institutions of higher learn
ing in the city, and judged the 
best at their film festivals, could 
be held.

Money for such undertakings 
is very tight, but if the univer
sity or Activities Board cannot 
be persuaded to finance the ven
ture, then what about the mer
chants in the area who depend 
upon CMU students for their 
success?
Although as of this writing all 
of this is but a dream, it is a 
goal worth working toward. The 
organizers of the festival have 
clearly shown that there is a 
goodly amount of interest in the 
cinema here at CMU, and for 
their work they are definately to 
be commended, but they should 
not rest on their laurels. Next 
years festival should try for 
something bigger, for if the fes
tival doesnt continue to grow 
it will die when its organizers 
graduate. The Third Annual 
CMU Film Festival is just a 
dream, yet it may not be too 
early to begin making it a reality.

RECORDS SCRATCHED
by JIM TOMAYKO
Over the last decade a Carne
gie track team could expect to 
lose to Grove City by anywhere 
from seventy to one hundred 
points. On Tuesday at the Grov
ers home track the margin was 
valiantly cut to nineteen as 
the Tartans lost 82-63 despite 
smashing two school records and 
either tying or beating eight in
dividual personal records.
The loss followed a 76-66 de
feat at the hands of Westminster, 
and a double victory over Alle
gheny and Washington and Jef
ferson (97-48 and IO8V2-36V2 re
spectively) last week. But those 
meets were of pedestrian quality 
compared to the startling perfor
mances on the unusual 1/3 mile 
track. The day got off to an 
excellent start as the 440 relay 
quartet of Dave Venzie, Jay 
Corpus, Jay Gazdacko and Tony 
McKay sped to a 43-6 clocking, 
cutting a half-second off the 
year-old school record. The oth
er school record to bite the dust 
was the three-year standard of 
58.6 for the 440 hurdles as Hen
ry Finch lowered it by six-tenths 
to win his race. To complete the 
story of amazing quarter-miling, 
Tony McKay became the first 
Carnegie runner in nearly thir
ty years to get a sub-50 second
440, as he convincingly defeated 
all the Grove City runners with 
a 49.4. But this was only an 
inkling of what was to come: 
The first three runners on the 
mile relay, Corpus, Joe Lorhan 
and Chuck McDonough, brought 
Tony a 32 yard deficit on the 
Grove City anchor man, mostly due 
to Lorhans fatigue after a fast 
half-mile and McDonoughs 
still feeling the effects of his 
collapse last Saturday. McKay 
then proceeded to make up 
thirty-one of those 32 yards by 
racing an incredible 48.1, his fast
est split and one and one-tenth 
seconds under the present Car
negie school record, held by 
Techs only Olympic athlete, Tom 
Coulter. Since it was in a relay, 
it can not count as a new re
cord.
Lorhans fastest 880 of the sea
son, 2:02.2 was in vain as three 
Grove City runners finished en 
masse between 2:00.7 and his 
time, easily the fastest, crowded 
finish in recent experience. Con
tinuing the story of close finishes, 
Jay Corpus put on a tremendous 
closing rush over the last few 
yards to edge Dave Venzie for 
the century victory. Both were 
timed in ten seconds flat, and 
Jay Gazdacko completed the only
BEER HERE
The softball fields this -year 
have been the hosts of some of 
the finest comedy seen on this 
campus in years. Slow-pitch 
games were intended to speed up 
the action, place a higher prem
ium on overall team defense, and 
improve the caliber of play. The 
results have been altogether in
congruous with these ideals. To 
state a case in point, the E.J. 
Carp, last years second place 
finishers, fell behind last week
13 to 3, after one inning. They, 
of course, rebounded to win 30 
to 18 in a game which lasted 
two hours and twenty minutes. 
In another game the Sig Alphas 
(why do I always keep bringing 
them into these articles?) took a 
safe 21 to 18 lead into the last
inning. Three outs and some four 
errors later Kappa Sig led 22 to 
21. This game, however, was a 
long way from over. SAE used 
the ingenious strategy of hitting 
the ball into its oppositions 
gloves. After a two-hopper to the 
pitcher and a pop-up to the cen
ter fielder placed the tying and 
winning runs in scoring position, 
SAE needed only a misjudged 
liner to the left fielder to win 
23-22.
With these and similar results 
in softball occurring, are 2 to 1 
football games far away? Count 
on our intramural board to change 
the rules in another sport. Until 
then, stop by the softball fields 
one afternoon, and bring your 
adding machine.

Carnegie sweep of the meet 
with a 10.7 in third. Venzie later 
collected a win in his fastestever 220:22.4.
The distance squad has not 
been up to recent years quality 
in either time or placings, as 
three of the top five runners are 
freshmen and still unused to dou
bling in the mile and two mile. 
Last week they began to come 
into their own with some victor
ies and steadily improving times. 
Ken Kloess 4:43.5 third on Tues
day was his fastest mile to date.
Other Carnegie victories in
cluded a 409 triple jump by 
Ray Willia, following his school 
record 435 of last Saturday, 
and also a 198 long jump by 
the same athlete; a 17.1 hurdle 
victory for Brad Chandler; and 
Wendell Miller continuing his 
string of 510 high jumps.
Joe Jamison recorded his bestever javelin toss of 1755, but 
could only garner third.
The Tartans meet Case and 
Geneva on Friday at 3:30 in 
the Tech Bowl, St. Francis and 
Waynesburg on Monday at the 
same time and place and close the 
season Wednesday at Thiel.

by DICK FIGLER
Well, tomorrow is the big day 
and heres how I came to my fin
al predictions. First of all, some 
people really tried to make it hard 
on me, cause there were no less 
than seven new buggies out on 
Sunday morning. Of these, some 
didnt roll well, had steering or 
I alignment problems, and one of 
them moved so slowly that the 
driver used his hands to push it 
down the course. There were, 
however, two buggies that rolled 
very well, ATOs new buggy and 
Betas. The former is very similar 
in design to SNs Hornet and 
Xrother Rat and the latter is sim
ilar to the Pika design. Also mak
ing news this week is the Delts 
buggy, which not only looks like a 
tough contender for the design 
trophy, but rolled better than ev
eryone last Sunday ... if they only 
had a stronger push team.
The second way in which every
one tried to foul up my predictions 
isat the very end of free roll 
about four of the top contenders 
all ran full course at the same 
time and since my stop watch 
cant keep track of all these times 
at oncethere will be some 
guessing on how well they did.
Ill leave myself one more out 
if my predictions prove to be faul
ty and that is each yearat least 
one or two of the top potential bug
gies either spin out, their brakes
