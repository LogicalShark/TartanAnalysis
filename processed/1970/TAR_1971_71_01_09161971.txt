CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY/ SEPTEMBER 16, 1971
BUDGET PLAGUES CMU
In his annual address to the 
faculty and administration, Presi
dent Stever reported the financial 
difficulties that continue to plague 
Carnegie-Mellon University. In an 
almost incomprehensible budget
ary presentation, President Stever 
reported a budget deficit of 4.3 
million dollars for the fiscal year 
ending last June 30th.
The original budget deficit was 
estimated to be $2.9 million and 
was later revised to $3.6 million; 
however, when the audit was taken 
recently, a $4.3 million deficit was 
revealed. President Stever cited 
several reasons for the inaccurate 
forecast, the two most prominent 
being that tuition income was 
$583,000 less than originally esti
mated and that overall grants and
contracts income was down 
$559,000. He also noted that 
short-term investments produced 
$150,000 less than estimated. The 
only upward notes concerning the 
budget were that the projected 
endowment income of $5 million 
was realized, and that the pre
dicted budget expenditures were 
within 1% accuracy.
President Stever expressed 
cautious optimism by noting that 
H&SS received a $1 million grant, 
and that the University had sold 
some land for a substantial sum 
of money.
Looking toward the future, 
President Stever indicated that 
further budgetary adjustments 
might be necessary because grad
uate and undergraduate enroll
ment, as of September 8, is down 
285 students from last year. This 
figure is likely to increase by next 
semester. This could possibly 
mean an additional drop of $1 
million in income. President Stever 
also noted:
The Dramatic Arts Center is 
ready for the first phase of the 
three phase project to construct 
the new complex.
The appropriations for an addi
tion to Skibo have been sliced 
from $4 million to $1.4 million.
The need for new student 
housing is apparent, but the status 
quo will have to remain due to the 
financial difficulties that the Uni
versity is encountering.#

CITY UNIVERSITY SELECTS 
KIBBEE AS CHANCELLOR
When the largest university in 
the world began its search for a 
new chancellor last April, the 
chairman of the search committee 
told the press that the next chan
cellor would have to be someone 
who can keep about forty balls in 
the air at the same time and keep 
tracHof them.
Consider that an understate
ment.
More precisely, the next chan
cellor would have to be someone 
who could juggle, simultaneously, 
twenty college campuses, two hun
dred thousand students, a union
ized faculty, an open admissions 
policy, the nagging urban prob
lems of New York City, and a 
swelling budget of nearly four hun
dred million dollars, and keep 
track of them.
The university in question is the 
City University of New York; and 
the product of its now completed 
search for a master juggler is a 
bald-headed, forty-nine year old 
man who shoots golf in the 
nineties, and who also happens to 
be Dr. Robert Kibbee, the VicePresident ior Administration and 
Planning at Carnegie-Mellon.
Moving from a second-ranking
post at a single-campus university 
of 4,500 students into what is per
haps that largest educational 
administration job in the world, 
Dr. Kibbee appears to be accepting 
the challenge philosophically. If 
youre going to bomb, bomb big, 
he says.
Dr. Kibbees opportunity to 
bomb big came after the New 
York City Board of Higher Edu
cation had considered more than 
one hundred candidates for the 
City University chancellorship, 
among them James E. Allen, for
mer United States Commissioner 
of Education; Dr. Charles Young,
chancellor of UCLA; and Dr. Sey
mour Hyman, presently deputy 
chancellor of City University. 
University.
Rumors earlier this summer had 
reported that Dr. Kibbee would be 
leaving Carnegie-Mellon to accept 
the presidency of Reed College 
this fall.
What is likely to have especially 
qualified Dr. Kibbee in the opinion 
of New Yorks Board of Higher 
Education were reports of his suc
cess as president of the Pittsburgh 
Board of Education in restoring 
public confidence in the school
board which, for some time, was 
thought to be unresponsive to 
blacks and students.
The (New York) Board, said 
its chairman, was impressed with 
the evidence that Dr. Kibbee is 
fully aware of, and has the capa
city to deal with the problems of 
urban education, especially the 
problems of a diverse community 
within the urban environment.
Dr. Kibbee describes the chan
cellorship of City University as 
similar to the chairmanship of a 
conglomerate. As chancellor, he is 
the chief administrative and educa
tional officer of the twenty-two 
member board which governs the 
university, and which is concerned 
mainly with the management and 
distribution of the universitys 
four hundred million dollar budget 
among its twenty campuses-some 
of them two year schools, some 
four, and some graduate schools.
The City University was formed 
in 1961 by an administrative mar
riage between all of New York 
City-financed colleges: Queens, 
City, Brooklyn, and Hunter Col
leges. During the last decade, City 
University undertook an enorSATUYT/RP AT B16 ,

MAYORS LEAD RALLY
It was billed as not just another 
rally, and the main attraction was 
of course not just another 
candidate-no candidate at all, 
supposedly. The honorable Mayor 
of New York, John V. Lindsay,set 
out for Pittsburgh to be the main 
speaker at last Thursdays Register 
For Peace and New Priorities Rally 
at Point State Park. At that rally 
Mayor Lindsay shared the podium 
with such political figures as Re
publican presidential candidate 
Pete McClosky, John Kerry of the 
Vietnam Vets Against the War, 
Black Congresswoman Shirley 
Chisholm, and former New York 
Congressman Allard Lowenstein. 
But if there was any doubt about 
who the star really was, Pittsburgh 
Mayor Peter Flaherty soon set all 
minds straight. Lindsay was 
honored guest at a special recep
tion in the mayors office ... a 
reception Pittsburgh style. With 
the thermometer reading94, flood 
lights on and cameras rolling, both 
mayors munched on pastrami 
sandwiches and exchanged pleas
antries with Flahertys cabinet and 
other assorted dignitaries.
After being tossled by re
porters, Mr. Lindsay gave in 
smilingly as Pittsburgh Councilwoman Amy Ballinger continued 
posing him in front of Mrs. 
Flahertys deluxe Poloroid 
shouting who else wants in on 
this one. When all present had 
been introduced, including a stray 
bus driver from McKeesport, 
Mayors Lindsay and Flaherty pro
ceeded on a triumphal walk 
through the Steel City. The rally 
people had prepared well for this 
event. Bull horns announced the 
arrival of the two Democratic 
glamour boys at every street cor

Editors Note
Before this year starts rolling, 
lets get one thing straight we, 
you and me and everyone else in 
this and every other academic 
community are riding on the 
worlds largest Gravy Train.
If you are a student, sit back for 
a moment and watch the full time 
passengers, the professors, as they 
get on and off the Gravy Train as it 
makes its regular stops at all points 
in the Academic Womb, including: 
Tenuretown, Sabbaticalville, Ninemonth Workyear, and Committee 
City.
Then, wander around and see 
what the Train has to offer you, 
the four year passenger. Your fare 
is paid for, courtesy of mommy 
daddy, or uncle sammy, or uncle 
milty, or even the Gravy Train 
gaiifoad Company itself. The 
earliest start youll ever get is at 
8:30 in the morning, and appoint
ments, generally, are ignored at 
whim. Members of the opposite or 
same sex (whichever you prefer) 
are abundant. Second and third 
chances are given at just about 
everything you fail academically. 
And you have the freedom to in
dulge in whatever you fancy, be it 
a quest for identity, a discussion of 
cinema verite, or a search for the
perfect gram, all without fear of 
reproval, in fact, with a pretty 
good chance of finding a professor 
who actually takes you seriously 
and will allow you to persue it as 
an independant study project or, if 
you bother to write down a cur
riculum, as a self defined major.
If you are new, and wondering 
just who the professors are, I offer 
you this litmus test to find them. 
Individually approach all fellow 
passengers on the Gravy Train and 
make the most half-assed state
ment of your life. Those that agree 
with it are the professors.
Actually that is an overstate
ment. Professors wont always ag
ree but a least they will tolerate 
half-assed statements. They prac
tice this unusual tolerance not be
cause theyre weak, mind you, but 
because tolerance is their profes
sional responsibility. Society, you 
see, allows professors their lifetime 
ride on the Gravy Train in return 
for their promise to listen to the 
brainstorms and philosophic rot of 
Societys over-opinionated and un
der-experienced Pepsi generation. 
For some professors, tolerance is 
no chore, mainly because they are
as half-assed as many of the stu
dents; then too, some take student 
ignorance philosophically,viewing 
it as the first phase of the learning 
process. Unfortunately, the suc
ceeding phases of the learning pro
cess do not come while one is on 
the Gravy Train.
This constant availability of an 
always polite ear for your opin
ionsa product of the concept of 
Academic Freedom is a unique 
and most luxurious feature of the 
Academic Gravy Train. Those who 
have stepped off the Gravy Train 
outside the Academic Womb are 
reported to have been seen talking 
to themselves.
Dick Gregory is a very funny 
man, but he outdid himself here 
last when he said, the student is 
the new nigger. His audience, 
however, took it seriously and 
sprung to its feet, thunderously ap
plauding the announcement of its 
new status, glad to be the nigger 
now, purged of all that nasty 
white-middle class guilt that comes 
with riding on the Gravy Train.
Golly, I thought we were sup
posed to laugh. Im no nigger, Ive 
got it made; Im riding on the Aca
demic Gravy Train and I love it.#

pushing the overall University bud
get from fifty million dollars in 
1961, to four hundred million this 
year.
City University has gained 
attention in the last year for its 
policy of tuition-free open admis
sions to any graduate of a New 
York City High School who wants 
to become a full time 
undergraduate student.
Dr. Kibbee supports the open 
admissions policy, but describes 
himself as a pluralist in education, 
feeling that there is a need for vari
ety in available educational insti
tutions, i.e., secular, religious, 
selective, or open. The philosophy 
behind City Universitys open ad
missions, he said, is that the qual
ity of a university is measured 
more by the kind of student it 
turns out than the kind it takes in.
To improve the quality of City 
Universitys graduates, Dr. Kibbee 
plans to improve the quality of the 
teaching at the University. This is 
to be achieved through close attenIn 1 to the studentsevaluations of 
professors.
City University is on solid 
ground financially, he feels, since 
both the State of New York, under 
Governor Rockefeller, and the 
City of New York, under Mayor 
Lindsay, the universitys two 
sources of revenue, are strong sup
porters of education.
In Pittsburgh last Thursday for
the Voter Registration Rally, 
Mayor Lindsay called Dr. Kibbee 
an excellent man and said he 
was very happy to have him in 
New York. I think our relation
ship will be very good, he said.
Dr. Kibbee was born on Staten 
Island, raised on Manhattens West 
Side, and educated at Fordham 
University. After graduate work at 
Chicago, he took an appointment 
at Southern State College in Mag
nolia, Arkansas. From Magnolia, 
he went to Drake University in Des 
Moines. He left Drake in 1958 
after taking his Ph.D. in college 
administraiton from the Univer
sity of Chicago, and served three 
years in Pakistan as an educational 
advisor to the Pakistani Govern
ment. He came to Carnegie Tech in
1961 as an assisstant to the Presi
dent, and in 1965 became the 
Vice-President for Administration 
and Planning. When President 
Warner stepped down here in 
1964, Dr. Kibbee was considered a 
possible candidate for the presi
dency of Carnegie Tech.
By now, however, Dr. Kibbee 
feels that ten years with the same 
university in generally the same 
position has been long enough and 
hes glad to be returning to New 
York City.
When he does return at the end 
of this month, he will be welcomed 
by a furnished rent-free town 
hosue, a limousine and chauffeur, 
and a personal fleet of maids, all in 
complement to the chancellors 
annual fifty thousand dollar 
salary.

NATIONAL FIGURES 
SPEAK AT RALLY
Continued from pg. 1 
they happened to live. CBS report
ers and cameramen balanced pre
cariously from CMUs PiKA firetruck as it followed the mayors 
party down Fifth Avenue to Point 
Park.
Though Mr. Lindsay had re
ceived top billing and Mr. Flaherty 
had done his best to reinforce that 
position, the most dynamic and 
attractive member of the group 
walking through downtown Pitts
burgh was New York Congress
woman Shirley Chisholm. She 
showed the same eagerness and 
excitement on the streets that 
characterized her remarks during 
the rally. With a slight revivalist 
tone, Miss Chisholm urged the 
young people present to take 
over the country at the polls, and 
to change the system from top to 
bottom. The fifteen to twenty 
thousand young people present 
gave the congresswoman a stand
ing ovation.
In his first speech outside of
New York since his change of 
party, Mr. Lindsay bemoaned the 
plight of young jobless Americans. 
He urged young people to build a 
coalition committed to end the in
justices in American life. His 
remarks were characteristically 
non-partisan and contained no 
hint of his future political plans.
Vietnam War veteran John 
Kerry and Republican presidential 
hopeful Pete McClosky both made 
strong efforts to revive the Viet
nam War as a topic at the rally and 
as an issue in the 1972 presidential 
campaign. Both speakers attacked 
President Nixons policy of wind
ing down the war as illusionary 
and inhumane.
Thursdays rally may have had 
only limited success in its main 
objective of registering newly en
franchised voters. The final figures 
will not be available for some time. 
In any case Pittsburgh will have a 
while to wait before it sees another 
political extravaganza of the same 
scale.  Bob Boyle
LOWENSTEIN: "NO RIGHT TO SIT OUT."
Informally disguised as a 
former U.S. Congressman came 
Allard Lowenstein to the green of 
the CMU cut last Thursday after
noon to rouse the young to 
righteous wrath and registration. 
Lowensteins visit to the Carnegie 
campus was primarily Madison 
Avenue for the mass registration 
rally held later that same day at 
Point Park. (It should be
fun .. . There should be some use
ful speeches.)
A1 Lowenstein, of the dump 
Johnson movement fame, is de
termined to do it again; only the 
names and faces have been 
changedWhat weve got to do is 
to clean out this whole bunch. In 
a brief opening barrage, the former 
representative from New York ex
pressed his conviction that young 
voters must not let independent
non-partisan sentiments bar them 
from participating in the primary 
elections, cautioning that if they 
waited too long, we would again be 
faced with two candidates but no 
choice. Lowenstein made it clear 
that as yet he neither actively en
dorses any particular candidate: 
Let them woo us, nor does he 
urge voters to blindly mount the 
Democratic bandwagon: God
knows Im not urging anyone to 
vote a straight party line.
Following his introductory re
marks, Lowenstein invited queries 
from amongst the modest multi
tude gathered on the cut. (Crowd 
estimate did not exceed any opti
mistic 250 head count.) When one 
listener verbalized his belief that 
election participation is rendered 
futile by big business immense po
litical control, Lowenstein was
quick to suggest that it is a very 
unfair oversimplification to 
blame our Vietnam involvement 
on the machinations of big busi
ness. Rather, he located the guilt 
on two arrogant and dishon
est Presidents and a gutless 
Congress, and said, the only way 
were going to end the war is to get 
rid of those people that support 
it.
Lowenstein also expressed his 
dismay at other aspects of Nixons 
administrative record,contending, 
The problem with Nixon isnt 
just the war, God knows. Hitting 
at the selected unfairness of the 
Presidents New Economic Policy 
he quipped, I am delighted to be 
able to agree with George 
Meany . .. that Nixons policy is 
Robin Hood in reverse.
At moments waxing rather elo
quent, though avoiding exposi
tions of passionate rhetoric, Al 
Lowenstein concluded his ap
pearance with a reiteration of his 
conviction that all must become 
concernedly involved in the up
coming national elections. Most 
elections have not had much mean
ing. I think this one has very pro
found meaning ... No one has the 
right to sit it out.#

SCIENCE HALL 
NOW OCCUPIED
There are more and better 
facilities here than were available 
at Scaife Hall, observed Harry 
Rowell, Assistant Director of the 
Computation Center about that 
center. But he might just as well 
have been speaking of Science 
Hall, the newly opened building 
that houses the Computation 
Center.
Located directly behind Doher
ty Hall, Science Hall makes for an 
imposing new structure on cam
pus. Entering through the main 
entrance (onto the fifth floor, 
oddly enough) one is immediately 
and agreeably impressed. My ini
tial impression was that, unlike 
most buildings located on the 
C-MU campus, this one has a 
pleasant, even cheerful, atmos
phere. But on further examination 
one cant keep a slight negative 
note from infringing. After a while 
gray concrete becomes mono
tonous and a general feeling of 
drabness encroaches.
Science Hall does have some
important advantages in its favor. 
First, and most obvious because of 
its very size, there is far more space 
for everything. Classrooms are lar
ger. Staff members can now be 
allotted office space. There is even 
room for a mini-library devoted to 
scientific and technical materials. 
Three elevators take students from 
floor to floor, and various small 
but comfortable lounges are avail
able for the students convenience.
The buildings biggest plus, 
though, is its location. Unlike 
Scaife Hall, which housed many of 
the features, particularly the 
Computation Center, now incor
porated in Science Hall, the new 
eight story building is more cen
trally located and far more acces
sible to the students who will use 
it.
Science Hall is open around the 
clock for anyone wishing to take 
advantage of its facilities. The 
building is still not fully com
pleted, as some minor touches are 
yet to be added.#

Last Tuesdays opening meet
ing of the Faculty Senate was 
mainly concerned with the effect 
of President Nixons wage and 
price freeze on faculty salaries.
Several factors have compli
cated the issue. First, some faculty 
members have already received 
salary increases during the sum
mer. Second, no definition of what 
the Cost of Living Council regards 
as legitimate pay raises is clear. 
And third, the administration 
hasnt declared what risks they are 
willing to take in giving the pay 
raises.
If pay increases should be 
denied the rest of the faculty mem
bers, those who received a raise 
this summer would have to forfeit 
it. The proposed salary increases 
for all faculty members would cost 
the University a total of $ 100,000. 
University Vice-President Schatz 
insisted that $100,000 is not a sig
nificant factor in terms of savings 
for the University, and that Presi
dent Stever hoped to initiate the 
pay raises.
Under Old Business, University 
Vice-President Kibbee reported 
that the court challenge to Penn
sylvanias 1970 law denying finan
cial aid to those students convicted 
of disruptive activity had been suc
cessful. The law held that students 
convicted of misdemeanors, dis
turbances, or felonies must be 
reported to the State by the 
University.
Faculty Senate sent a resolu
tion to the administration asking it 
to work for the repeal of the legis
lation, and theadministraiton sub
sequently wrote to the governor 
and certain senators, noting its dis
approval of the legislation. When 
Bryn Mawr College challenged the 
law as unconstitutional, a Phila
delphia court, in a two-to-one 
decision, found the law to be in 
violation of the first, fourth, fifth, 
ninth, tenth, and fourteenth 
amendments. Only the section of 
the law requiring the reporting of 
felonies was upheld.
Professor Beekman Cottrell 
reported on the establishment of a 
permanent office for the Blood 
Bank. Those interested in dona
tions or information should call 
extension 582.
Dr. Cottrell also reported that 
there will be faculty dinners on 
Wednesdays at 5:30, and that the 
Faculty Social/Happy Hour will 
continue to be held on Wednes
days at 4:30. The Presidents 
freeze has taken effect on the price 
of drinks.
Under New Business, Professor 
McTaggart gave a stirring report on 
the Facultys contribution to the 
United Fund Drive. Out of a total 
289 personnel in English, Math, 
Drama, Chemistry and History 
departments, only 28 contributed 
last year. Professor McTaggart is 
looking for help this y ear. 
For the 71-72 academic year, 
Student Government has allocated 
$7,000 to the Activities Board 
($1,000 of which has already gone 
to MDCfor movies) to distribute 
among groups who wish to pro
gram events during the school 
year. The Activities Board has 
developed the following statement 
as a guideline for those desiring an 
appropriation:
Purpose: This fund exists as an 
opportunity for campus groups 
other than the Activities Board to 
produce programs that will com
plement those activities pro
grammed by the AB and other 
campus programming organiza
tions. Through administration of 
this fund, the Activities Board 
hopes to encourage balanced and 
diverse programming that will 
benefit the campus community as 
a whole.
Who can use it: Any organiza
tion recognized by student govern
ment or any group of individuals 
that has interest in producing a 
program may petition the 
Activities Board for an appropria
tion. A group wishing to produce 
an event should first explore the 
possibilities of doing so through 
already established organizations
such as the Activities Board and 
other programming bodies. The 
program should be an open event 
and should be planned for the 
campus community as a whole.
Criteria for Allocation3^ Re
quests for funds will be evaluated 
according to the following variables%
 Creativity-how is the program 
different from past and present 
programs?
 Participation-the commitment 
of the group to produce the pro
gram and the potential attendance 
at the program.
 Balance-does this program fill 
a need that is not being filled by 
any other organization.
 Concreteness-how well form
ulated is the proposal and plans for 
producing the event?
 Feasibility-is the program feas
ible with respect to its timing and 
the amount of work necessary to 
produce it?
 Cost-is the program economic
ally practical?
No more than sixty per cent of 
the fund will be allocated for fall 
programming. A group may not 
receive more than $1,000 per 
semester from the fund; organiza
tions with budgets over $5,000
MUSEUM ACQUISITIONS: 
Two films made by Stan 
Beakhage in Pittsburgh,

must match the appropriation 
they receive. (If the event 
generates income and a profit, the 
profit shall go back to the campus 
Programming Fund.) Any group 
receiving an allocation must on 
publicity for the event specify that 
the money for the event came 
from the Campus Programming 
Fund.
The Activities Board is now en
tertaining proposals for programs 
for the fall and spring semesters. 
All applications must be submitted 
by Friday, October 1, to Skibo 
Information Desk. At that time, 
the AB will meet with the inter
ested parties to discuss and 
evaluate plans to use the fund. De
cisions concerning appropriations 
will be announced approximately 
one week after the deadline. If 
there are still funds available after 
this time, a group will be able to 
petition the AB for money at any 
time. Of course, its advantageous 
to meet the above deadline.
The allocation received by a 
group is subject to review by the 
AB at any time; should the group 
fail to meet the specifications of its 
proposal, the AB may intervene 
and the group may lose its budget. 
If a group is dissatisfied with the 
decision, it may appeal to Student 
Government.#

EUROPE...
Its September 16th and by 
now everyone on campus has 
heard about what a great summer 
vacation everybody else has had. 
My summer vacation was OK, 
nothing to rave about, but nothing 
to complain about either. The 
strange thing about my vacation 
was that the best part of it, as well 
as the better part of it, was spent in 
Pittsburgh. The lesser part of my 
vacation was spent in Europe.
Europe was crowded. The hos
tels and hotels were crammed with 
students and tourists. So were the 
roads, trains, ferries and other pub
lic facilities. Wherever I went the 
scene was the same: students hasseling and haggeling for space on 
the road, in the trains and cars, and 
in the hostels. How do people tol
erate such situations?
The answer is simple. Every 
trying, sleepless, crowded, hasseled and dehumanizing condition 
tolerated in a summer full of Eur
ope is something somebody in the 
following fall can say was easy, 
relaxing and enjoyable. When one 
says that the food was great, what 
he really means is that he didnt 
have to run and blow his ass out 
after every meal. When one says 
that it wasnt difficult to thumb a 
ride, what he really means is that 
he waited only two hours instead 
of four. When one says that the
facilities were clean and neat, what 
he really means is that the dust and 
dirt were spread one-eigth of an 
inch thick instead of one-quarter 
of an inch. When one says that he 
met some great people, what he 
really means is that he met some 
kinky dudes who were wandering 
about and constantly questing for 
their identities or some other such 
nonsense.
The people I met, the conver
sations we had and the stories they 
told were all the same. Every per
son I met seemed to be a videotape 
replay of someone I had met ear
lier. Travelling in Europe is now 
equivalent to being in a very forced 
situation. The resulting conver
sation with some jean-wearing, 
back pack-carrying brother would 
always be inevitable:
Hey man, whats happening 
around here?
Not too much really, just see
ing what there is to see.
Yea, same with me. 
Whereve you been? 
London, Amsterdam, Brus
sels, Paris and etc ... I had a great 
time in all those places. Amster
dam was the greatest. Whereve 
you been?
Copenhagen, Edinburgh. . 
Did you like it?
It was alright.
The conversation would go on
for a few more minutes and I 
would eventually be asked whe
ther I had any dope. Then when I 
said no, hed lay on some rap about 
the great hash he had and if I 
stopped in at the El Paradisio, or 
something like that, I could have a 
great time. These dialogues, or 
should I say monologues, always 
ended with him telling me of his 
incredible times.
I found the tales of the females 
I met to be much more credible. 
After all, they somehow always 
beat me to every ride, train, and 
hotel space available.
Europe in the summer is not the 
place to go in this age of reduced 
airfares. There is just one last great 
thing I have to tell. I was thumb
ing, you see, and like all of a sud
den these two great looking 
women stop and

Falso
Mike Nichols latest film,CAR
NAL KNOWLEDGE, is one of the 
most brilliant and shattering films 
to be released in recent memory. 
Perhaps easiest described as a 
mens liberation film, CARNAL 
KNOWLEDGE shows what hap
pens to two friends who treat wo
men as easily disposable sex ob
jects.
Jack Nicholson and Arthur Garfunkel play the two young men in 
question, and the film traces their 
lives from their college days in the 
forties to their lives in the sixties 
and seventies.
Nicholson plays the super stud 
of the two. His actions are ruled by 
his groin as he moves through life 
seemingly searching for the key to 
paradisethat Big Orgasm in the 
Sky. The only thing that spoils his 
quest is that it enslaves him, for 
instead of enjoying sex he persues 
it until it has little real meaning for 
him. Yet he continues, never real
izing that he cannot find his goal 
for it is merely a figment of his 
imagination.
In CARNAL KNOWLEDGE 
Nicholson tops the performance 
he gave in FIVE EASY PIECES 
He is electrifying stunningleaving 
the audience so shaken that it is 
almost speechless. Never once does 
the role get out of his control, nor 
does he ever let his performance 
degenerate into pathos. A great 
deal of the film rides on Nicholson, 
and he carries the load effortlessly.
As Nicholsons best friend, Ar
thur Garfunkel is perfect. His 
naivete in believing that sexual sa
tisfaction and love ar the same 
things is absolutely unnerving, and 
yet, to his credit, he makes the role 
so believable that the audience not 
only accepts, but also genuinely 
sympathizes with this phallic 
bumpkin.
Garfunkel has become a suc
cessful actor in the space of two 
films. To avoid becoming another 
Elliot Gould flashacrossthe 
marquee-type he must carefully se
lect his roles while continuing to 
grow and develop. Still, after view
ing his latest effort, one must ad
mit that he definitely has the po
tential to be around for a very long 
time.
Together in this film Nicholson 
and Garfunkel are fantastic al
most too good to be true. Their 
portrayals kept giving this writer, 
as well as other males he has talked 
to, unnerving flashes of Deja vu, 
especially in the earlier college se
quences of the film. There is a cer
tain bond between close male 
friends that has to be experienced 
to be understood, and Nicholson 
and Garfundel captured it perfect
ly.
Besides establishing Nicholson 
and Garfunkel as two screen 
forces, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE 
also provides a turning point in the 
careers of Candice Bergen and 
Ann-Margaret. It is in this film that 
Miss Bergens fans loyalty is vin
dicated. For too long they have 
had to defend her through a series 
of films better left forgotten by 
telling everyone that, Dammit, 
she really can act. She really is 
good. Well now Miss Bergen is 
telling that to everyone who sees
this film. She portrays a young co
ed who marries for security with 
just enough sensitivity, indecision, 
and naturalness to make her char
acter live while, at the same time, 
carefully avoiding the idiot-coed 
stereotype. At last Miss Bergen is 
no longer just a hauntingly beauti
ful face; she is now a gifted actress 
who in an all too brief role has 
shown that she is very much in 
control of her craft, and its de
mands.
The real mind-blower of CAR
NAL KNOWLEDGE however is 
Ann-Margret, for while the film 
merely proves what many people 
already feel or suspect about 
Nicholson, Garfunkel and Bergen, 
it shows what hardly anybody has 
realizednamely that Ann-Mar
gret is one helluvan excellent act
ress whose talent has been wasted 
throughout her film career. Pre
viously thought of as the beautiful 
possessor of that big bust which 
melted the grease on Elvis Presleys 
pompadour in more than one film, 
she has now come out of nowhere 
to prove herself with an explosion 
of dramatic brilliance which easily 
steals the film for her, and consid
ering her competition that is no 
small feat.
As Nicholsons rommate she 
goes from a beautiful model to a 
trapped, frustrated, unwanted sex
ual object who will not permit her
self to be thrown away without a 
struggle. It is this struggle between 
her and Nicholson which provides 
the films most highly charged mo
ments. Nicholson is so good, so 
believable in these scenes that it is 
frightening, but Ann-Margret (is 
her last name just -Margret?) 
proves to be more than competent 
in not just holding her own, but in 
setting the pace.
A goodly amount of the credit 
for the success of CARNAL 
KNOWLEDGE must go to the au
thor of the screenplay, Jules Feiffer. Doubtless Feiffer fans will re
cognize his cartoon style in many 
of the films sequences, yet this 
style succeeds amazingly well in 
telling a protracted story. Feiffer 
realizes that the motion picture 
has matured as have todays audi
ences so instead of smoothly pre
senting his story, he cuts from one 
event to another leaving the audi
ence to plug in some gaps for them
selves. While some may find this 
annoying, for after all it will force 
them to use their minds, many will 
find that this technique should be 
more widely employed for it elimi
nates a great number of irrelevant 
sequences while at the same time 
not injuring the film in the least.
Whenever a motion picture con
tains an intelligently translated 
screenplay coupled with excellent 
performances a great many acco
lades must be given to the director 
of that film. In any movie it is 
possible to bring across the mean
ing of the screenplay, and even eli
cit one or two characterizations, 
but to make a film that success.- 
fully adapts a challanging work, 
emphasizes the humorous and 
shattering elements of that work 
while downplaying its episodic 
qualities and at the same time con
tains four excellent performances
is not just luckit is the result of a 
directors having mastered his art, 
and Mike Nichols certainly has 
done that.
In his career he has made only 
four films, yet two of them: 
WHOS AFRAID OF VIRGINIA 
WOOLFE?, and THE GRADU
ATE are regarded by some movie 
buffs as modern classics while 
CATCH-22 is held as being a very 
good rendering of a flawed screen
play adapted from an extremely 
difficult novel.
In CARNAL KNOWLEDGE 
Nichols not only directs his actors, 
he also seems to be directing the 
audience as well. The viewers are 
involved in the film until they feel 
as if they have a stake in what they 
are watching. Nichols begins this 
subtly by having a conversation be
tween Nicholson and Garfunkel 
heard while the credits are being 
shown. By the time that the two 
are finally seen, the audience is 
well aware of their feelings about 
sex and women. Thus Nichols has 
not wasted any time in delineating 
the characters of his two main actors-the audience knows as much 
as they need to about them to be
gin the film.
Touches like this are continued 
throughout the picture. In one se
quence, Garfunkel is picking up 
Bergen at a party, and in the back
ground at the other side of the 
wide screen is Nicholson, still com
pletely in focus, yet doing nothing 
more than watching the proceed
ings seemingly with disinterest. It 
is not until a few scenes later that 
the viewer discovers v.hat was go
ing on in his mind at the time.
As the film progresses the view
er is made more and more aware of 
what these two men are thinking. 
In several scenes they are shown in 
conversation discussing their feel
ings about their lives and their 
troubles. In these conversations 
(monologues really) the person 
speaking looks straight into the 
face of the person to whom he is 
talking. That person, however is 
not visible on the screen, so the 
one speaking actually addresses 
the audience. The effect of this is 
staggering for the viewer finds him
self wanting to desperately talk 
back to the character.
Nichols never permits his film 
to lag or become boring. He estab
lishes a pace and keeps it up while 
managing at the same time to keep 
the audience along with him. In 
lesser hands Feiffers screenplay 
could have easily become a sham
bles, but as the film cuts from the 
forties to the sixties and then to 
the seventiesall without warning-it is a tribute to Nichols skill 
that all but a few of the slower 
viewers (who were more pre
occupied with trying to get the last 
Mason Dot out of the box and give 
it away when they found that it 
was a green one than in watching 
the film) were able to fully under
stand and appreciate what Nichols 
was successfully accomplishing.
CARNAL KNOWLEDGE is an 
utterly brilliant film whose biggest 
flaw is that it is not long enough. 
Nichols leaves his audience asking 
for more, a rare achievement in aperiod when many directors leave 
them asking for less. #

Most people leave here in the 
spring with a sigh of relief that 
they will be away from Pittsburgh 
for a few short months, but some 
of us live here year round, and have 
to make do with whats available. 
So for those of you who spent 
your summer elsewhere, here are 
the concerts you missed this 
summer.
On June 2nd, Delaney and 
Bonnie and Friends, minus 
Bonnie, played a dynamite, shakeyer-ass, rocknroll set at the Civic 
Arena, followed by Frank Zappa 
and his Mothers. The new Mothers, 
including the two lead singers of 
the Turtles and ex-John Mayall 
drummer Aynsley Dunbar, have all 
the old idiotic stage antics that 
Frank Zappa has always liked, but 
very little of the fine musical ab
ility of the old Mothers. Ive al
ways enjoyed listening to Zappas 
music and sort of endured all the 
comic theatrics that came with it, 
but at this concert, underneath all 
the screams and grunts and dirty 
words, there was nothing much of 
interest.
Not rock, but of musical in
terest nonetheless, Van Cliburn appeared with the Pittsburgh 
Symphony at Three Rivers Sta
dium later in June. Van Cliburn

played what I guess is his specialty, 
the Tchaikowsky Piano Concerto, 
and he did a very good job; but the 
real show-stopper was the finale, 
the 1812 Oveture with fireworks 
and six cannons on the field. It was 
very flashy, very showy, and very 
loud.
On July 12th, Jesus Christ 
Superstar began its nationwide 
tour at the Civic Arena. I wasnt 
there, but I heard that everyone 
from six to sixty had a real good 
time. Rated G.
On July 15th, a triple-header 
act hit the Syria Mosque. First on 
the bill was Matthews Southern 
Comfort, who played some very 
nice country music, including their 
fine version of Woodstock. Next 
was Deep Purple, who showed that 
they are still back in 1066 as they 
slink onto the stage, stand there 
looking sultry and evil, and play 
superficial psychedelic bullshit. 
Last but by no means least was 
Rod Stewart with the Faces, un
doubtedly the high point of the 
summer concert series. Bear in 
mind that Rod Stewart is this 
writers favorite artist when I say 
that he is a brilliant singer and 
dynamite stage performer. The

MacGlaglan, and drummer Kenny 
Jones, are all fine musicians too. 
Drummer Jones in particular is one 
of the very few rock drummers 
who can play an extended solo 
without 1) sounding like Ginger 
Baker, or 2) boring you to tears.
The week after all that, Steve 
Stills passed through town. Again, 
I wasnt there, but from what I 
heard and from what I know about 
Steve Stills, I can say that he had 
an adequate musical offering, no 
more, no less.
The first week in August saw 
the Who, the Jackson Five, Glen 
Campbell, and the Osmond 
Brothers at the Civic Arena in 
about as many days. The Who put 
on a really fine concert, doing 
mostly tunes from their new al
bum, Whos Next.
That was the best of summer, 
1971. I havent heard much about 
who has been booked for this year, 
except Black Sabbath, coming 
soon for all you speed and occult 
freaks.
I was originally supposed to 
write an article about the Manhat
tan Transfer concert, but I went 
and left in the middle of it, so I 
guess thats about all I need to say.
Fighting spiders and ticks isnt 
my idea of a welcome home, Mr. 
Collins. This column has nothing 
to do with spiders and ticks, alt
hough I have to patrol my room 
each night for vermin of the 
crawling variety. Im tired of it. 
Im in A-215 Hamerschlag now, 
and so far in five days, Ive 
wrapped at least ten 1 i inch 
spdiers in Kleenex balls. Not to 
mention five things that look like 
overgrown tacks. Why me? To
night I finally whisked away all the 
spider webs and leaves and other 
breeding grounds right outside my 
window. Suffocate or get para
noid. Sorry, I dont live with in
sects, or crustaceans. Not to 
mention the gnats.
I also forgot my dictionary 
when I came. So its 2:30 in the 
morning and you find yourself a - 
wake. Yesterday at 3:00 a.m. you 
were playing pinball. Your mail 
was another big zero. (You just 
jerked your head to the rightwas 
that a bug flying or your hair?) 
Skibo food begins its relaxing ef
fects on your alimentary tract with 
your first meal. And your last.
Your taperecorder is slow, so 
you adjust it. Too complicated to 
tell others about, so you use the 
word adjust? Easy. Lets go out 
to the lobby, you say, remembering a commercial.
Meet people you knew last 
Spring, have nothing to say to j 
now, and have to go through the j 
game anyway.
Whats your schedule like? j
You lucky bastard.
Take it easy.
A gnat in the ice tea flies away j 
before the fresh glass is poured. It j 
was considerate.
Bookstore lines accept you, and 
you flow along with the rest of the 
students through aisles, lines, filing 
past the cashier, check in one 
hand, pen in other, ready to fill in 
the amount. You obtain two 
slinkys, presumably for physics ex
periments.
They turn out to be relaxing. 
You put away saltines and ice tea 
as you churn out homework for 
men who tell you that as long as 
you churn out homework for men 
who tell you that as long as you 
churn out homework for men 
who ...
Your four-color spiral note
book tells you youre here. Your 
freshly un-painted room tells you 
youre here. Seeing faces you saw 
before and avoided annoys you. 
After all, youre only human.
Welcome back, Mr. Cynic, we 
missed you, whats your schedule 
like? #
BYRD
Both musicians and non
musicians associate the promin
ence of the classical guitar with 
Andres Segovia, the man thought 
of most often as being the impetus 
and behicle to the present success 
of this instrument. From the pure 
classical music, however, jazzmen 
began to work the instrument into 
their own styles, so that now we 
can clearly distinguish between 
jazz and classical guitar. There is, 
though, a man who somehow was 
caught in the middle, who never 
quite made it to one side or the 
other. He is Charlie Byrd: a fine 
classical musician in his own right, 
a superb jazz guitarist as well.
Unlike most jazzmen, he does 
not usually use an electrified in
strument. He uses only an acou
stic, classical guitar with the subtle 
help of an occasional microphone. 
Charlies background and experi
ence is staggering, but to relate his 
importance now, his significance, 
is to describe his musicin all its 
fervor, melancholy, passion and 
wistfulness. Watching this man
perform is enjoying one of the few 
who seems never to lose that one 
quality which makes a superb tech
nician and stylist-sensitivity. It is 
not a sensitivity related only to his 
music and his instrument, but one 
that touches the audience and the 
individual at the same moment. 
Charlie speaks with you through 
his guitar. You are at once listening 
to the contemporary tales about 
Happy Hearts, Aquarius, and 
Making People so very Happy 
at the next instant, you can hear 
strains of improvisation that let 
you feel the simple greatness that 
has made Charlie Byrd a dynamic, 
classical-jazz artist.
His back-up instruments are 
usually percussion, bass, and flute 
or horns; all of this creates a world 
of clean, sensitive music of all sorts 
and moods. However, Byrd is 
never really predictable. His phras
ing and pulsations make you think 
he has just invented the piece he is 
working on.
Maybe he has.
The Cats Cradle Coffeehouse 
opened last week in the Staff Cafe
teria with the highly successful 
Roger and Wendy. Enthusiastical
ly received by overflow crowds 
Monday and Tuesday, the duo pro
vided lively entertainment with 
excellent vocals and instrumenta
tion (Wendy on bass, Roger on 
auto-harp, electric piano, and 
kazoo). Wendy singing Mr. 
Bojangles and the antics of Roger 
doing John Wesley Harding 
were especially memorable. Big
gest crowd pleaser was Horny 
Night in Pittsburgh.
The Activities Board is planning 
more tine entertainment in the 
Cats Cradle. Last year there were 
coffeehouses every Saturday night 
with local entertainment. This
semester we would like to move in 
the direction of fewer but better 
coffeehouses. Roger and Wendy 
were good entertainers and drew 
quite a large audience. By having 
more coffeehouses of this calibre 
(like Brian Carney and Don Craw
ford last year), we can more fully 
reach the Activities Board goal of 
quality entertainment. This does 
not rule out regular Saturday night 
coffeehouses. They could prob
ably be arranged with free enter
tainment, following the example 
of other area coffeehouses. If you 
would like to help plan some of the 
coming events, or would just like 
information about what Cats 
Cradle has in store, get in touch 
with Ray Schmitt via Skibo infor
mation desk.#

month, named a new chairman.
He is Ludwig F. Schaefer, a 
scholar of European history and a 
member of the CMU faculty since 
1957.
Dr. Schaefer has also been pro
moted from associate professor to 
^ full professor.

situations leading to World War 
II, THE IT ALI AN-ETHIOPI AN 
CRISIS - TOUCHSTONE OF 
APPEASEMENT. He is a contributor to and co-editor of two 
widely used history textbooks on 
Western civilization.
Dr. Schaefer was a co-director 
of the CMU Cooperative Program 
in History, a recent program for 
history teachers at small, develop
ing colleges.
The new department chairman 
will be replacing Dr. Irving H. 
Bartlett, who will be on leave of 
absence next year and will devote 
full time to teaching and research.

No exortation today is found 
splashed so frequently on campus 
walls as Free Angela Davis. 
Though she is a hero to some, 
many find demands for her free
dom puzzling, if not outrageous.
At a meeting last month of the 
National Student Council YWCA, 
discussion centered on the topic, 
The Web of Racism in Higher Ed
ucation. The outcome was a reso
lution presented by the Third 
World Caucus, a splinter group of 
black YWCA members chairmanned by CMU junior Alice 
Easly, on the subject of Angela 
Davis. The resolution, which fol
lows, presents a compact exposi
tion of the reasoning which views 
Angela Davis as a much wronged 
champion of the people.
 ... we point to the most 
glaring example in the country of 
unjust persecution of a member of 
the University Community be
cause of her firm refusal to divorce 
her training, experience and skills 
from the pressing needs of the op
pressed people in the community 
about her.
We express our grave distur
bance over the protracted patterns 
of harrassment which our sister 
Angela Davis has suffered from the 
time the highest public officials of 
the state of California invaded the 
college campus to dislodge her 
from her position because of her 
personal political beliefs and her 
involvement in the American free
dom struggle.
As Angela wages a fight for her 
life in California, the Third World 
Constituency declares unequivocably that we have little faith in 
the legal and political procedures 
in this country when it comes to 
protecting the interests and the 
lives of Third World peoples.
In terms of the realities of the
moment, we call upon our fellow 
students to devote their energies 
now on thier respective campuses 
to exercising leadership roles in de
manding bail for Angelafirst on 
simple humanitarian grounds 
when a human being is held in 
what amounts to solitary confine
ment over a long period of time, 
secondly, because such penal treat
ment when one is only charged 
with a crime, not convicted of one, 
inherently violates presumptions 
of innocence, and thirdly, because 
the defendant must be enabled 
now to proceed without hindrance 
in assisting in the full preparation 
for her trial. The last is vitally im
portant because she will be on trial 
for her life in an atmosphere 
markedly hostile to her, and in 
which, if it proceeds, it is not pos
sible for her to be judged by a jury 
of her peers, because her peers are 
not a part of the social, economic, 
and political structure of the coun
try in which she is being tried.
We of the Third World there
fore regard the State of California 
as being equally on trial as Angela. 
We believe this to be a historical 
trial in which a champion of the 
people will be speaking not only 
for herself but for the thousands of 
us who are unjustly charged with 
offenses against the law and held in 
prisons of America virtually as in
mates of concentration camps.
As Angela and the state which 
has charged her thus come forth to 
be weighed, we have no doubt that 
the results will be if through the 
power of the people, the scales of 
justice can be held in balance at the 
start. In the strength of that belief, 
we call upon our fellow students 
all over this land to join their 
voices and their energies to ours in 
the necessary campaign to FREE 
ANGELA.

HAYES' STRANGE MATH AGAIN
Since the student-taught Fundamentals of Math" course taught in 
the Spring Semester was quite successful, it is again being offered. In 
this class upperclassmen are teaching mathematics, for which they 
receive course credit in 85-512 Seminar in Special Topics, Teaching of 
Mathematics. The instructors are studying cognitive processes in mathe
matics and the process of instruction. In addition they are responsible 
for instructing approximately five students. The upperclassment are 
given whatever support they need in subject matter and instructional 
techniques.
The students in 21-104 Section E will be instructed in the elements 
of Calculus and will have the advantage of being taught in very small 
classes by sympathetic instructors.
If you are interested in such a 
Hayes in MM 110.

SPORTS
FOOTBALL
fr
$
Contrary to popular opinion 
CMU does have a football team, 
even though theres no marching 
band.
With this in mind, Coach Joe 
Gasparella and staff have designed 
a flashy new offense and a stalwart 
defense to keep the fans enter
tained and the opposition 
miserable.
This Saturday Big Red plans 
to introduce its new set of quin
tuplets: quarterback Rich
Tricky Squires, running backs 
Terry Bizerko Bell, and Tom 
Lumpy Lombardo, and wide re
ceivers Brian Gridder Carlock 
and Chuck Price. Playing together 
for the first time, they hope to 
spark a dangerously potent offense 
that couls strike at any time.
Vets Danny Weakland, Denny 
Doran, George Spearchucker 
Pavlik, John Moore and Scott Cal
vert, along with freshman Robert 
Maletic at tight end, should pro
vide the blocking to keep Big 
Red moving freely. Junior letterman Chris OLeary, the team 
cheerleader, will also see extensive 
action in the backfield.
The remainder of the 16 return
ing starters hold down a strongarm 
defense. Lettermen Art Hunkele, 
John Evanoka, and Gary Meilahn, 
and newcomers Juan Neffa and 
Phil La Gatta should be the first to 
greet opposing running backs. 
Iinebacking vets John Sabol, who 
has recovered from a nose injury, 
Mike Bralhowski and Ray Terza 
have taught freshman Mark Small
wood some fancy footwork and 
the four of them should roam the 
field at will.
The defensive backfield, usual
ly the Tartans weakest area, has 
been shored up with newcomers 
John Radic and Terry Lyskava 
coupling their speed and cunning 
with the talents of vets Ronnie 
Shinault and Bill Vukoder.
Big Red has had only one test 
thus far, a scrimmage at Geneva, 
September 4th. Neither team was 
well polished but the Tartan de
fense exhibited sharp hitting and 
heads up play. The offense was 
sluggish, but has smoothed the 
rough edges in the past week of 
practice.
Thiel will be out to revenge last 
years 28-21 loss, but the Tartans 
are up for the game with Chris 
OLeary heading the locker room 
cheering section, the varsity is 
gaining spirit which should peak at 
about 1:30 Saturday. Follow the 
Tartans and let them surprise you. 
This year theyre going 8 and 0. 
FROM THE BAGPIPE; Rich 
Squires and Tom Lombardo are 
this years captains. .. Juan Neffa 
has added his won spark to the 
defense. The plays are now called 
in Spanish and they break their 
Huddle with Vamos . . .Not to 
be outdone, the offense is hum
ming ... Juan also carries his soc
cer shoes to the game; he kicks 
field goals with them . .. the team 
is so hard this year that they are 
eating rocks .. . #

SOCCER
Despite four returning All-WP1SC players, Head Coach 
March Krotee feels his team will be 
hard-pressed to equal last years
6-3-1 record. CMU players were 
the highest vote recipients for both 
WPISC offense and defense: Peter 
Moses, lineman; and Juan Neffa, 
back. Brian Newick, a back, made 
the second team, as did Jack Borsewitz, veteran goalie. Krotee will 
have a host of experienced players
returning and hopes to have one or 
two outstanding freshmen.
The bad news is that several 
schools in the W'estern Pennsylvan
ia Intercollegiate Soccer Confer
ence are likely to improve as much 
or more than CMU, thanks mainly 
to substantial scholarship pro
grams. CMU finished third last 
year in the 12-team WPISC, but 
will have to work hard to do as well 
this year.#
CROSS-COUNTRY
It might well be Coach Gary 
Meckley lamenting, Where have 
all the young men gone? Ap
parently only two runners will be 
returning from last years out
standing, underclass-dominated 
team. The 1970 harrierssix fresh
men, two sophomores and one ju
nior-posted an 8-2-1 record, shut
ting out four opponents and tying 
the 1969 District NA1A Cham
pions, California State. The two
definitely returning runners are 
sophomores Tony McKay and Ken 
Kloes, and although McKay is pro
bably one of the best runners the 
Tartans have ever had, he is primar
ily a sprinter. One incoming fresh
man that Meckley thinks can help 
the team is Dave Meixner, from 
Monongahela. What should have 
been one of the best all-time sea
sons for the CMU harriers may 
turn out to be one of the longest.

Unexpected turnovers have left 
the Carnegie-Mellon Cross Coun
try team with a squad of only six 
men. Fortunately, four are re
turnees, all lettermen: sophomores 
Ken Kloes, track MVP Tony 
McKay and juniors Wayne Bing
ham and co-captain Dennis Sulli
van. However, a cross country 
squad needs a minimum of five 
runners so the team is barely 
rounded out with freshmen new
comers Greg Hyatt and Dave 
Byers.
The pressures at C-MU are 
many but they are enhanced when 
one participates in athletics as 
well. Out of a student body in the 
thousands, there has not been 
more than twelve men on a cross 
country team in many years (sur
prising for a sport of supposed 
growing national interest); in ad
dition, there has been only one 
four year man in the last three 
years.
In spite of the size, past teams 
have done well. However, though 
potential exists within this years 
six runners, the team lacks any 
depth that can cancell the effect of 
possible injuries.
The opener is against Bethany 
at 11 00. September 25 on the 4.2 
mile home course starting at Flag
staff Hill(spectators, bag
pipers ... anything besides rabid 
squirrels will be welcome).
Cross Country has never been 
easy: this year it:., just be a little 
tougher.
