i, The Jacques Loussier Trio To Open 
Third North American Tour Here
Thursday, March 25, 1971
On April 2 at 8:30 p.m. the Jac
ques Loussier Trio will open its 
third tour of major concert halls 
and college campuses in the U.S. 
and Canada at the Carnegie Music 
Hall, sponsored by the Activities 
Board. They have performed an
nually throughout most of Europe 
to SRO crowds. They appeared 
three times in Londons Albert 
Hall in less than 14 months. The 
Hails 6,000 seats were filled 
with young jazz enthusiasts and 
scholarly classic Bach purists. 
They argued vociferously between 
numbers, each group claiming 
Loussier for their own. At the end 
of the concert, they all agreed suf
ficiently to give the group a rous
ing standing ovation.
The TrioJacques on piano, 
Pierre Michelot on strong bass 
and Christian Garros on percus
sionwas formed in 1959. Lous
sier was reaching for a new ap
proach to Bach . . . more than just 
a jazz version, but a true contem
porary improvisation of the orig
inal music. Thats what Bach ex
pected his students in his own day 
to do with his Preludes and Fu
gues. The Trio was restricted to 
recording for about five years. 
They started to give concerts in 
1964 and havent stopped since. 
And as Loussier has said, We 
just improvise on a theme of 
Bach. No two concerts are the
same. We are always improving 
our improvisations. When I look 
back at what we did 10 years ago, 
it appears to sound ridiculous.
Declining to call himself a jazz 
musician, Loussier prefers to call 
himself a concert pianist impro
vising with the jazz idiom. His 
music, inextricably bound up with 
Bach (. . . he is the father of jazz 
music ... his music swings with
out bass or drums and can be im
provised upon . . .) is in round 
figures a 50-50 combination of the 
old master and Loussier, who is 
very much of the 20th century.
Ah, but you ask why I play 
Bach, Loussier says. Well its 
very easy to explain. Bachs mu
sic is able to be translated in a 
modern way and we improvise on 
his work in a very respectable 
way. Im sure if he heard it, it 
would please him. Bach in my 
opinion is the only classical com
poser who can be used as a basis 
for improvisation in modern mu
sic. Many British groups are us
ing Bach material successfully.
Loussier was the first person to 
start this revival of interest in 
Bach. Ten years ago, he brought 
out his first album.
When I started playing the pi
ano, at the age of 10, one of my 
first pieces was Bachs, a two 
voice invention. And since then he
White Roots of Peace
From Monday night, March 29, 
to 4:30 Tuesday afternoon, March 
30, the Activities Board in co-operation with the Y Office of Com
munities Affairs will present a 
one-day encounter session with a 
North American Indian group to 
interpret the growing Indian 
movement as well as their tradi
tional values and ways. Known as 
the WHITE ROOTS OF PEACE 
after an Iroquis tradition, the 
group will bring Indian made 
films, speakers, singers and 
dancers.
Sakokwenonkwas, a young Mo
hawk spiritual leader, said the in
tent of the group was not to give a 
performance, but to meet in ex
change of culture and ideas. Our 
Problems are too great for us to 
be dancing for anyones entertain
ment, he said. We want people 
to understand our ways so they 
can join with us to dance in friend
ship and unity.
Hichard Oakes, also Mohawk, is 
scheduled to speak as well. He 
"as active in the Alcatraz and Pit 
River, land occupations. Oakes 
"as critically injured last June in 
a brutal attack shortly after he 
attempted to make a citizens ar
rest on the president of the PaciHc (as and Electric Company, a 
large holder of land claimed by
Pit River Indians. He has just re
cently been released from the hos
pital.
Because each member of the 
group is actively involved in the 
U.S. and Canadian Indian move
ment, reservation activities, and 
ceremonial events, the exact com
position of the group of ten varies 
from week to week. However, us
ually included are folk singer Wil
lie Dunn, who also made the wide
ly-acclaimed film Ballad of 
Crowfoot, which will be included 
in the films to be shown.
None of the group are profes
sional show people and all funds 
raised on their tour are used for

Jacques Louissier was born in 
Angers, France, in 1934. He stud
ied at the Paris Conservatoire of
Music until he was 17. Since I 
had to survive, I left the Conser
vatoire and did a lot of things like 
playing with a touring orchestra. 
Jacques also went to Cuba and 
played in an orchestra there, but
he eventually went back to Paris 
where the Jacques Loussier Trio 
was born in 1959.

B.B. King: Blues Boss King
Before he stepped on the stage at the Filmore he received a standing
ovation.
The reason hes such an unpretentious man is because fame was 
so long in coming. He had his first hit in 1949 and has been recording 
ever since. At 44, he has just realized his justified fame. But the road 
to success has been a long one for B. B. King.
I was going to be a spiritualist, a gospel singer. My mother would 
take me to church and Id duet with her. I went in the Army when I was 
18, but was out after three months because the South needed cotton 
picked, and local plantation owners ran the draft board.
I was pickin at 35 cents a hundred and choppin at 75 cents a day. 
I had me a group together then, and we sang around. The churches did
nt make us any money, but the dance halls did.
I made say, $18 a week pickin cotton, and Id take $10 of that 
and buy me a ticket on the bus to the farthest point you could get for 
the $10. Then Id get off at every stop on the way back and pick up some 
money for singin for folks. Sometimes, Id make more on a bus trip 
from Saturday afternoon to Sunday than Id make in a week.
Since those days in the Mississippi Delta, B. B. has developed his 
own musical theories and chord compositions. Never having the oppor
tunity to study music, B. taught himself ; his method is the culmination 
of years of self teaching, buying and picking apart music books. B.s 
early influences include Jimmy Rushing, Big Jo Turner, Elmo James, 
T-Bone Walker, and especially Lennie Johnson and Blind Lemon Jeffer
son: Whenever I think I'm losing what Ive got, I listen to Blind Lem
on or Lennie Johnson to remind me Im B. B. King, blues singer.
The first time B. B. became conscious of his fame was the first 
time he played the Filmore West. As he says:
Id played the Filmore before when it had an all black clientele, 
and when I looked out that night and saw all the white faces, I though the 
booker had made a mistake. But no mistake. After Mike Bloomfield's 
introduction of him as Chairman of the Board, B. B. King received a 
standing ovation before he stepped on stage. B. B.s discs include Live 
and Well, Confessing the Blues, Completely Well, Indianola 
Mississippi Seeds and his newest release Live at Cook County Jail. 
They are available on the ABC/Dunhill label.
The theme of Spring Carnival Weekend is the Fifties. B. B. King 
has been playing and recording for 23 years, through the fifties and the 
sixties. But it has been in the seventies that he is reaching the apogee 
of his career.
B. B. King will perform in the Carnegie Music Hall Saturday, April 
24. Tickets for C-MU students are $3. To insure yourself a seat at the 
concert, the Activities Board requests that you please buy your tickets 
now, at the Skibo Information Desk.
The Pittsburgh Pirates open de
fense of their divisional title on 
Tuesday, April 6, against the 
Philadelphia Phillies at Three 
Rivers Stadium. The Activities 
Board will sponsor a complete 
package for students and staff 
wanting to go to the game. A 
block of reserved seats have been 
acquired for the game and trans
portation will be provided by a 
chartered Port Authority Bus 
with reserved parking.
Total cost of the package will be 
$5. Tickets are now on sale at the

leave Skibo at 12 noon and return 
immediately after the game.

At the start of the rock ir. liaiiC 
boom Michael began searching 
for a place where he might reach 
his contemporaries with what had 
been regarded as archaic art 
form. In 1967, he made his first 
appearance in a vernacular en

Since then he has made appear

Although the group has met on 
many campuses all over North

marily on Indian communities. 
They covered 43,000 miles last 
year to meet with Pomos, Navajos, Utes, Shoshone, Mesquakie, 
Chippewa, Choctaw and in Cana

Treay, Bridge Blockade, and 
TRIBE, a new international Indi
an school in Bar Harbor, Me.
Speakers will meet with classes 
and informal discussion groups 
to answer questions and deal with 
special topics. According to Ateronhiatakon, a speaker, Unless 
people understand and follow 
their original teachings, as we 
still do, there can be no peace for 
us as Indians, or peace with the 
forces of nature.
He added that people who see
them expecting to see lots of 
feathers and fulfill their stereo
types of the Wild West or Holly
wood Indian will be disappoint
ed. We come as people, of the 
same height as you, as we are in 
reality, he said.
The name, White Roots of 
Peace, is part of the symbol for 
the first United Nations the world 
knew, an event usually neglected 
in American*- history books, ac
cording to head singer Karonhiio. 
The Iroquois confederacy was 
united under a Great Tree of 
Peace, with four white roots go
ing out so all peoples could find 
their way to peace in the shade of 
that tree. Since then, we have con
sidered an aggressive pursuit of 
peace as the mission of the Peo
ple of the Longhouse.
The films, discussion sessions 
and exhibits will be in the staff 
cafeteria Monday at 8 p.m. and 
Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. The major, 
presentation will be held on the 
cut at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday.

TARTAN disciples gather around their illustrious 1971 
OracleDoug Campbell.
The TARTAN staff has elected 
the editor-in-chief for the 1971-72 
publishing year. He is Doug 
Campbell, sophomore English ma
jor, and present news editor of the 
paper.
Campbells election was unan
imous and unopposed.
The new editor-in-chief plans no 
great changes in the TARTANS 
content or policy in the immedi
ate future, but rather will con
centrate, at first, on making 
changes in the present production 
procedures.
Campbell suceeds David Caney 
in the editorship. The coincidence 
between their initials is a stroke 
of economic luck for the TAR
TAN; mainly because it elim
inates the need of purchasing new 
sets of monogramed table linen 
for the Editors Dining Lounge.
New Student Senate Reconvenes; 
Recommends Good Friday Holiday
by MARGARET WACKER 
and DUANE E1LENTSON
Vince Misitano, newly-elected 
Student Senate president opened 
the Tuesday, March 30, meeting 
of the new Senate with the elec
tion of a new Student Senate chair
man, Mike Garl, Jude Heller, Joel 
Mannion and John Fricker were 
the nominees. Misitano explained 
that the chairmanship entitles the 
holder to membership on various 
other administrative committees 
as well as the Student Senate vice
presidency. After short speeches 
by each of the candidates for the 
position, Mike Garl was elected 
the new chairman; he promptly 
took over the proceedings.
Under Garls gavel, the new 
vice-chairman was elected: John
Fricker.
The next item on the agenda 
was the upcoming SPIRIT confer
ence. Senate members were 
urged to attend the conference 
since it will have some bearing on 
a document which SPIRIT plans 
to present later to the Senate for 
ratification.
The C-MU Womens Group ask
ed the Senate for a committee 
member from among the student 
senators. Volunteers were soli
cited.
Senators were asked to sign 
themselves up for one of five com
mittees: Rules, Finance, Publici
ty, General Campus, and Birth 
Control. Membership in at least 
one committee is required of all 
senators.
A motion was presented to the 
Senate, amending the present con
stitution to give the Executive 
Council veto power over the Stu
dent Senate. The motion was 
tabled.

Pre-Registration
1. Schedules of classes for the Fall Semester, 1971, will be avail
able during the week of April 5.
2. Academic departments will be set up in the gymnasium to pro
cess course and section enrollment on April 14 from 1 to 5 p.m. and 
6:15 to 9 p.m.
3. Since no provision has been made for cancelling classes on 
April 14, students must arrange individually:
a. To secure five approved schedule cards from their departmen
tal advisor. Note: Advisors are not to retain a copy. The new procedure 
will provide for the Registrar to return all copies to the students de
partments.
b. To appear at the gymnasium to be enrolled in courses and sec
tions. Procedure here has been changed. Students will not pick up in
dividual class cards but will have their names placed on class lists.
4. In addition to the approved schedules, it will be necessary that 
students bring to the gymnasium the student master ca^d which will 
have been mailed to them, at their home address, during the Spring 
recess. If for any reason the student^has not received a master card, 
he must secure a replacement at the Registrars Office. Students who 
are contemplating, or are in the process, of changing departments need 
not have their master cards changed in order to pre-register.
5. It is important that students indicate on the schedules the classi
fication (i.e., sophomore, senior, etc.) which they will have in the Fall 
rather than the present classification.
6. During the sumimer, instructions will be sent outling procedures 
necessary to complete registration and fee settlement and for proces
sing any needed schedule changes.
Chomsky Attacks Universities
Noam Chomsky, lecturing here 
last Thursday, said that continued 
ideological subordination to es
tablished external powers is the 
major threat to the independence 
of American universities.
An outstanding authority on lin
guistics and a professor at MIT, 
Chomsky spoke on the relation of 
universities to social stability and 
the status quo. He hit hard at the 
academic communities.
Since World War II, Chomsky 
said, universities have been ideo
logically subservient to econom
ically powerful outsiders, such as 
government and corporations. He 
charged that the educational state 
has created much of the cold war 
mythology and that this repre
sents the original politicization of 
the universities.

market-place for ideas, Chom"SPIRIT" presents:

May Day Activities
As part Of an extended road trip to enlist support for a series of 
spring demonstrations aimed at ending the American presence in 
Vietnam, seven members of the self-dubbed May Day Tribe came 
to Pittsburgh on Tuesday last. Their agenda of consciousness prodding 
included presentations at both C-MU and Duquesne University, and a 
mid-day news conference limited to representatives from the citys 
various colleges and high school newspapers.
At the news conference, conducted in the offices of the PITTS
BURGH FAIR WITNESS, three representatives of the May Day Col
lective (Tribe) explained the nature, organization, and purposes of the 
May Day Collective, and set forth plans as they now stand for the 
Spring Offensive against the war. The impetus for the Collective, 
they explained, was generated at the recent Ann Arbor Student Youth 
Conference. Regional representatives from this conference later met 
at Urbana and generated a general scenario for a program of spring 
anti-war activities. The May Day Collective was then formed to imple
ment this scenario. The Collective, based in Washington, D. C., is cur
rently fulfilling a primarily communicative role. The members inter
viewed envisioned their immediate task as not one of crusading against 
bastions of hawkish sentiment, but rather as one of mobilizing latent 
anti-war sentiment. Said one, We must consolidate the energy that we 
already have in the movement. There just isnt time to convert the 
hardhats.
Planned activities ennumerated include the following:
APRIL 1-4: Continuous demonstrations by members of the United 
Farm Workers, the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO),
uOoylByer, oy nsr wc
sky said. To attain this, he feels a 
substantial effort is necessary to 
compensate for the pressures of 
outside society.
Chomsky believes that the first 
check upon the cold-war politiciz
ation of the universities was 
made by the student protest 
movement. No one else was 
concerned about politicization 
then, he said, because it was 
socially acceptable.
In the physical sciences, uni
versities encourage their people 
to question basic assumptions. 
But in the social sciences, one 
may not examine the basic as
sumptions without being consider
ed a flaming radical hothead.
Now, he said, the universi
ties are slowly moving to a more 
neutral, academically free, non
politicized ground. If the pre
sent tide of repression can be 
beaten back the future isnt too 
gloomy for a university that is 
free and open.
Chmoskys remarks sparked ac
tive debate during the question 
and answer period, with, for the 
most part, C-MU professors de
fending themselves against Chom
skys charges of ideological sub
servience.
One professor told Chomsky 
that, in his opinion, Martha Mitch
ell is not Joan of Arc.
Chomskys Wherrett Room ap
pearance was sponsored by GSIA 
and was the first in a series by 
several lecturers on The Fu
ture of the Universities.

Student Senate Cont.

A request for allocations from 
the Astronomy Club was tabled to 
the Finance Committee.
A motion that the C-MU Film 
Workshop be reorganized by the 
Senate was tabled to the Rules 
Committee.
A motion to suggest to the EPC 
that classes be cancelled on Good 
Friday, April 9, was made. Be
cause of the coincidence of Easter 
and Passover this year, many 
students will either not be attend
ing classes that day, or they will 
not be able to observe the reli
gious holiday. Two votes were 
taken. The first was a general 
vote on whether such a recom
mendation should be made. The 
vote was 21-6-5 in favor of the mo
tion. The second motion as to 
whether the day should be made 
up at the end of the school year 
was voted down 13-17-5. The re
sults of these two votes will be 
passed on to the EPC with the 
recommendation that classes be 
cancelled on Good Friday.
The next procedure was the 
election of chairmen for internal
senate committees. The new Fi
nance Committee chairman is
Tanya Allmond, a freshman. The
Rules Committee chairman is
Joan Kodish, a sophomore, and 
second-year senator. The Publici
ty Committee, after some diffi
culty, chose Willy Roy Thompson, 
a freshman as its new chair
man. Finally, the General Cam
pus and the Birth Control Commit
tees retained their previous chair
men as heads, Don Sunderland 
and Judy Parkman, respectively.
After the election of chairmen, 
three additional motions were 
voted upon before the final roll. 
It was moved that the Senate is
sue a statement that Activities 
Board posters not be defaced or 
destroyed until the particular 
event has taken place.
The second motion to be passed 
stated that any cuts from the mas

slated for Harrisburg, to honor the late Dr. Martin Luther King.
APRIL 1: A womens march in Washington, D. C.
APRIL 19-23: Operation Dewey Canyon III, engineered by Viet
nam Veterans Against the War, is tentatively to feature varied modes 
of demonstration by veterans and relatives of dead GIs. It is named 
after a military operation purportedly analogous to the now infamous 
Mylai incident.
APRIL 24: A massive student rally in Washington.
APRIL 26-30: Continuous lobbying in Washington, including ef
forts to discuss the Vietnam War with federal employees.
MAY 1: A Celebration of Peace to be held on farmland near the 
Capitol. The May Day Collective is presently negotiating to obtain the 
farmland which is to serve as a base camp for the Spring Offensive.
MAY 2: A rally sponsored by the Peoples Coalition of Peace and 
Justice with Ralph Abernathy the featured speaker.
MAY 3-5: A period of non-violent civil disobedience conceived un
der the philosophy that if t^e government doesnt stop the war, we 
will stop the government. When questioned as to the implications of 
non-violent civil disobedience, the May Day people suggested that 
the phrase was to be interpreted on many different levels. Loosely 
organized in regional groups, participants are to exercise creative non
violent obstruction. Specific targets of the obstruction include the 
Pentagon and major access routes into the city. Tactics, while to be 
non-violent, are to be a matter of individual conscience.
The members of the May Day Tribe stressed the current urgency 
of the situation in Vietnam and voiced their perception that if the U.S. 
does not immediately withdraw from Indo-China, Vietnam and her peo
ple will be doomed to total physical desolation.
as a matter of convenience, the 
one defeated commuter candi
date, Myron Staroschak, be al
lowed to fill the seat.
Before closing, a final list of 
the constituencies was read as 
it appears in the constitution. 
They are as follows:
1. Graduate Students;
2. Active members of social fra
ternities ;
3. Undergraduate female residents 
of Mudge and Morewood Gar

all social sororities);
4. Independent undergraduate 
male residents of Mudge and

All women students who are in

to become part of the task force. 
The following are just a few of the 
categories to which C-MU stu

EVALUATIONS IN!
Kappa Chapter of Alpha Phi 
Omega is proud to announce that 
the results of the Fall, 1970, Faculty-Course Evaluation will be 
distributed during the first week 
of departmental pre-registration, 
April 5-9. This time the booklets 
will be distributed not only to the 
departments, but also to the dor
mitories through the dormitory 
representatives, to the fraterni
ties through the Council of Fra
ternity Presidents, and to the 
commuters in Skibo through the 
activities desk. There is no charge 
for a booklet; any student or fac
ulty member desiring a personal 
copy may obtain one by stopping 
by the activities office of A Phi 
O office in Skibo, or by calling ex
tension 214 or 595, respectively. 
We hope that the results will be 
helpful in pre-registration.
Also during the same week of 
April 5, the spring FCE will be
gin to take place. Distribution to 
the teachers will be through the 
departmental offices, as has been 
done for the past two semesters. 
This semester we are instituting 
a new feature of the evaluationsubjective comments. The stu
dents should write any comments 
about the instructor or course on 
the back of the card and the com
ments will be compiled with the 
aid of the Academic Affairs 
Boards. Most important of all, we 
urge all students to remember to 
bring a soft number two pencil 
with them to class to mark the 
evaluation cards. The cards are 
interpreted with mark-sensing 
and require a current to pass 
through the graphite in order to 
register a mark. In the past, 40 
per cent of the cards have had er
rors during the first mark-sensing 
pass. We hope that this percen
tage will decease so that the eval
uation can be speeded up.
student facilities for women (es
pecially health services), coun
seling and study skills, admission 
and placement of women, and fi
nancial aid. Also to be determined 
are the areas that totally ignore 
the needs of the female student.
Complementing the Student 
Task Force are the scheduled 
hearings of the Commission on 
the Status and Needs of Women 
at C-MU. A major function of the 
Commission is the examination 
of attitudes and policies towards 
women students. In a continual ef
fort to explore these areas, hear
ings with audience participation 
as well as closed, confidential 
sessions at the end of each hear
ing, will provide the opportunity 
for the women of the campus to 
relate their feelings, and, where 
discrimination is found, enable 
them to do something about it.
The entire campus community 
is invited to participate. The 
schedule of hearings is as follows:

Seminars Planned To Review African Problem
Most of the people of the 
United States are very vaguely 
aware that the history of this 
country has characteristically in
cluded a host of barbaric acts 
against Black people since 1619.
The American Way provided 
that more than 20 million sons 
and daughrers of Africa would 
be chained by twos and ex
tracted from the soil of Africa, 
packed like sardines in ships 
that took them to the Hell of the 
New Worldthe American In
stitution of Slavery. Within this 
institution Black people were 
chained in irons, beaten merci
lessly with whips and stcks, se
parated from their families, 
bought, sold, rented, bred to pro
fitable babies, worked and over
worked in the fields from sun
rise to sunset, fed just enough to 
keep them working, subjected to 
scientific experimentation, raped 
countless times, branded, dis
credited, hunted down with 
bloodhounds and shotguns, and 
murdered in hot blood and cold 
sweat.
Even fewer Americans are 
aware that even the Founding 
Fathers were beneficiaries of 
this un-American but quite
American system; that the first 
President of the United States 
held Black people in bondage 
until his death; that Thomas 
Jefferson, the architect of 
the Declaration of Independence, 
not only had Black slaves but 
also had mulatto children. To 
such men are monuments erected 
and after such men are cities, 
roads, and buildings named.
The American Institution of 
Slavery was formally ended in 
1865, and for the next 100 years 
our 5,000 Black people were 
lynchedstrung-up, riddled with 
bullets, drenched in kerosene and 
set aflame, castrated, fingers, 
toes, and ears cut off and sold to 
souvenir hunters. And while the 
victims were pleading for mercy 
and acreaming from pain, the 
mobs were hurtling insults 
upon them and drowning the 
anguish with mad laughter.
But that was the past, re
torts a present-day American. . . 
but I say No! This very day 
the American prosperity is 
still linked to Black slaverynot 
in Southern America, where 
Americans can se it, but in 
Southern Africa, where American 
businessmen use it. It was
South Carolina in the last cen
tury, it is South Africa in this 
century.
In 1619 the Dutch stole 20 Af
ricans from a Portuguese Man O 
War ship and took them to the 
Britishcontrolled American col
onies; an act which began 250 
years of profitable enslavement 
of Black human beings. In 1619 
it was the Dutch, the Portuguese, 
the British, the Americans. In 
1971 the Afrikaners (Dutch des
cendants), the Portuguese, the 
British, the Americans and in
deed the entire capitalist com
munity are still involved in ex
ploiting Black flesh for White 
profit, comfort, and security. 
They all have converged on 
Southern Africa, where the slave
holders, the Republic of South 
Africa, Rhodesia and Portugal, 
allow them to use the forced 
Black labor there to maximize 
profits.
The U.S. has over 500 com
panies in South Africa alone and 
over $800 million invested there. 
The gold which is taken from 
the ground near Johannesburg, 
South Africa by Black hands is 
put into the ground again at Fort 
Knox, Kentucky. Hence the very
NEW
When prices of albums were 
a little less costly, it was not un
usual for a person to go out and 
buy the albums that he had plan
ned to buy, and then buy a few 
that he had never heard, just for 
experimentations sake. Its a 
shame that man people dont do 
that anymore, because many very 
good albums of all kinds too 
often get lost in the deluge. The 
big thing now is to go out and 
buy the latest Crosby, Schwartz 
and OLaughlin albums as soon 
as they come out. And then you 
wait until the group breaks up 
and each member makes his own 
album (with the other members 
of the band, of course) and then 
you buy those albums. Later, you 
find out that the band has put out 
a live album which you simply 
must have, and so you buy that, 
too. What you have now is seven 
albums by the same people, under 
different titles. Yor record collec
tion becomes a little less than 
boring. The purpose of this article 
and others like it, is to introduce 
you to albums which are consider
ed the best new releases by the 
record companies, but which re
ally arent getting as much air 
play as the new Crosby, Schwartz 
and OLaughlin albums, or others 
like it. So....
Joy of Cooking/Joy of Cooking
This band, comprised of two 
female and three male members, 
combines a mixture of pleasantly 
melodic sounps and crisp percus
sive elements into a totally pleas
ing soft-rock-country sound. The 
two females, Terri provide most 
of the instrumentatvn and lead 
vocals, with the guys in the band 
contributing the bass and per
cussive elements, and backup 
vocals. The result is a solid, 
yet restrained sound which is at 
the same time forceful in its 
delivery, and yet delicate in its 
overall flavor. The sound is cap
tivating, producing a hunger for 
more of the same in the listener. 
The original songs on the album 
are quite good, fitting the capa
bilities of the band, who never 
try to go beyond what they can 
do. They play well, secure in the 
knowledge that they are playing 
best the way that they know how. 
For this reason, the album has a 
cohesive sound totally, a same
ness (which never becomes bor
ing) permeating the sound, which 
even works well when the band 
re-arranges two traditional tunes.
nations which demuce race dis
crimination in South Africa bene
fit financially from that discrim
ination and would suffer some 
unpleasant economic setbacks if 
it were ever stopped.
The wars of liberation in South
ern Africa, though deemed justi
fied by the U.N. General Assemb
ly, are being opposed by Portu
gal, South Africa, and Rhodesia. 
These nations have received mil
lions of dollars in military train
ing, weapons systems and sup
plies from the U.S. and its ma
jor allies.
The four seminars to be held 
next week (April 5-8) will pre
sent, analyze, and discuss the 
U.S. policies in Southern Africa. 
They will be conducted by repre
sentatives of the Ameccan Com
mittee on Africa, Africa Research 
Group, and he United Nations.
It is my opinion that the rift 
between Black and White Ameri
ca shall widen despite domestic 
gains as Black Americans become 
more aware of the complicity be
tween White American Business
men and the White racists and 
fascists in Southern Africa, who 
still insist upon the inferiority 
and the enslavement of Black
people. This rift in America and 
the long war that is inevitable 
in Southern Africa can be avoid
ed, pending, among other things, 
the quantity and quality of infor
mation the American people 
are presented.
The South African govern
ment is currently spending in 
excess of $7 million on propa
ganda. The widespread ignorance 
of the American pople on the 
Southern African situation can
not be abandoned to be exploited 
by the most racist, fascist, reli
giously fanatic, and repressive 
government in the world.
Because the situation in South
ern Africa will grow in impor
tance as the war in Southeast 
Asia winds down, Spirit seeks to 
help lay the groundwork for 
analyzing the Southern African 
crisis by presenting as much fac
tual information as possible.
We urge the attendance of all 
students and faculty members, 
because we do not wish that the 
American people should bcome 
polarized because of the Ameri
can foreign policy in Southern 
Africa, and because we believe 
that awareness is a necessary 
ingredient for future peace.

GROUP RATES AVAILABLE_________________
BLACK VINYL
Mockingbird and Brownsville 
Station into a medley. It comes 
off very well, the transition be
tween the two songs being hardly 
noticeable, carried over by the 
rhythmic inventiveness of the 
two drummers, and the vocals 
of (the band and the album,) Joy 
of Cooking is a rare audial deli
cacy.
Country Home/Bronco
Utilizing the popular effect 
of doing one side of their album 
acoustically and the other elec
trically, Bronco shows their abil
ity to handle both the subtle and 
the funky aspects of country-rock. 
Country Home is a well puttogether album, showing that the 
time and effort of its creation 
were well worth it. One gets the 
impression while listening that 
the band has been together for 
sometime. The songs are well 
written and played convincingly. 
The down-home and relaxed at
mosphere that the album creates 
calls for an end to the ever-constant paranoia that modern man 
experiences: Its civil of you 
stranger/to take me for what I am. 
youre more a friend than a dan
ger/about the time you lent your 
hand. Credit goes to Brian Hum
phries (Engineer) and Jess Rhoden 
(Lead vocal, guitar and percus
sion) for putting a finely balanced 
and well-mixed album.
The acoustic side was more to 
my liking, but both sides are 
well done. Bronco utilizes two 
electric guitars BASS AND SIX 
STRING ( AND TWO ACOUSTIC, P 
DRUMS AND HARMONICA. The . 
balance is clear enough that 
each instrument comes through 
in a clear, individualistic way. 
Country Homea sweet taste 
of country living.
EnergyVJeremy Steig
Flutist Jeremy Steig, with the 
aid of his friends on bass, piano 
and percussion, has produced 
a beautiful instrumental album 
entitled Energy. The album 
comes off very well, with Steig 
semi-improvising his way through 
eight songs on flute, (alto and 
bass) and alto piccolo, weaving 
and blowing his way through an 
already texturally melodic back
ground which becomes more of a 
counterpointing, counter-melodic 
movement, augmenting and com
plementing Steigs lead. At first 
listen, the album sounds too sim
ilar, too redundant because the
same instrumentation is used on 
everytrack. However, to an aver
age listener most instrumental 
tracks are difficult to separate 
as singluar pieces the firsttime. 
What Steig has tried to do in 
this album is to produce a mood, 
a feeling, rather than stress each 
track as a piece in itself; the 
tracks do take on distinctive 
qualities after an intense amount 
of listening, but the album pro
duces as a whole. The title, En
ergy, suggests a theme, and an 
intense amount of energy is 
evident throughout all songs, 
sometimes bursting on the sur
face, but mostly rippling beneath 
in a wave of intensity that car
ries each song to its climax and 
beyond. Energy is a subtle, 
texgural organic album; it is 
one which needs to be fully 
heard as a totality, for that is 
its beauty.
Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band
The Screaminig Yellow Zonker 
does it to your head with such 
classics as the questioning Why, 
and the answering Why Not. 
The musicians are fine, the music 
a bit strange, but Yokos voice is 
an easy to listen to as it is to 
swallow a six pound egg roll.
Tjader/Cal Tjader
One of the top vibes players 
in the country, Cal Tjader has 
produced many fine albums for 
quite a few years. Not being 
familiar with this mans past 
work, I cannot judge his work in 
a progressive musical context. 
At first listen, the album soundded rather commercial and stwe. 
The songs being re-hashed favor
ites like Donovans First There 
Is a Mountain. The album is 
not really as simplistic as I 
thought; its good easy listening. 
Lets say it would make a nice 
birthday present for your mother.
Bummers
uOoylByer, oy nsr bc 
exactly why Carter is killing so 
many people, and why his 
brother was murdered.
In Get Carter Hodges elicites 
a very good performance from an 
actor many critics were begin
ning to write off, while at the 
same time using Wolfgang Suschitskvs cinematography to cap
ture the feeling of what he is 
trying to portray. It is too bad 
that Hodges didn't further util
ize these talents, for as the film 
now stands they only serve to 
heighten its deficiencies.

To get any further than Doherty

which appears at first to be a 
dead-end. Do not be troubled, be
cause this lock will operate with 
any key. The door will open into 
the comp-sci building, and from 
there you can feel around to find 
the next leg of the tunnel.
Other than the preceding, few 
obstructions will fall in your way 
while exploring. If an employee 
threatens to expel you, just begin 
to shake one of the pipes and you 
will be left alone. What person

At any rate, the tunnels are 
there. Wear old clothes. Get a can

Frats can initiate pledges there, 
paranoid heads can smoke there. 
Bring chalk and write on the 
walls. Be the first on your floor to 
explore the tunnels.
For written permission (Xerox 
copies only) to traverse the tun

The Carnegie-Mellon under
ground will be disturbed to know 
that it has been discovered! But 
the underground referred to here 
is a literal underground, the sys
tem of navigable steam tunnels 
about which many of you have 
have vaguely heard but never seen. 
Here they are finally exposed to 
the public, so that you may in
spect them yourselves at your 
own risk.
The purely functional purpose 
of these tunnels is to house the 
steam pipes leading from the 
power plant at Hamerschlag to 
the other classroom buildings. 
However, the tunnels serve an
other, more interesting, cause: 
they provide an intriguing trip 
through a cement and pipe hot
house, a journey sure to interest 
the up-and-coming spelunker. The 
tunnels extend from the gymnasi
um to Hamerschlag Hall, with off
shoots still being explored. The
temperatures inside the tunnels 
(which, incidentally, are lighted) 
range from a cool 60 degrees to a 
dry dusty 100 or so. The dimen
sions of the tunnels vary accord
ing to location. Beneath the Fine 
Arts building, the height of the 
tunnel is about four feet, its width 
three feet. These cramped quar
ters are no doubt due to a lack of 
appropriations for a larger one 
for the Fine Arts complex. To
ward the gymnasium or Doherty 
Hall, though, the tunnel increases 
to a height of about seven and onehalf feet and a width of five feet. 
You can touch the pipes if you 
want, but you wont want. They 
can be hot and/or dirty. Dont 
waste your sense of touch on them.
There are repeated places 
where the sign Employees Only
All Others at Their Own Risk 
appears in stenciled paint on the 
brick walls. I guess this means 
that the public isnt allowed
through the tunnels, but nobody 
will stop you if you are. With one 
exception.
If you happen upon the pipe 
warehouse deep in the bowels of 
Hamerschlag Hall, which re
quires going through the yet-tobe-designed comp-sci building, 
you will be kindly told that per
mission is required from a my
thical office somewhere nestled 
in C-MU. You can believe them 
and leave, but will your curiousity
the pipe after the heat disappears 
in all the classrooms?

The Activities Board Film 
Committee is pleased to an
nounce that through a special 
agreement with the Popular 
Culture Association, it will pre
sent Norman Mailers latest film 
Maidstone.
Maidstone is said to be 
about a pornographer making a 
pornographic film. But it is 
really more about a filmmakers
confrontation with the people 
who are making the film with 
him. Above all, it is about 
Norman Mailers search for 
self-discovery as an artist and 
compassionate human being.
The film will be shown at 7 
and 9 p.m. on Wednesday, 
April 14, in Porter Hall 100. 
Admission is one dollar.

stage appearance was in Brook
lyn when he was 15 years old. 
His first appearance was in New

introducing Jmr Forth and Holly Woodlawn directed by Paul Mornaacy
SHADYSIDE
WALNUT STREET MU.2-1901
to be perfectly honest, the film 
is pretty revolting also. David 
Niven certainly has come a long 
way from Separate Tables. 
Another actor who has also gone 
a long distance is Robert Vaughn. 
In this film the former Man 
From U.N.C.L.E. plays an Amer
ican ambassador who is not 
searching for T.H.R.U.S.H., but 
for a man who, as the ads in 
the East Village Other would 
put it, is well-hung.
With The Statue Cinerama 
inadvertently succeeded where it 
failed with the other two pic
tures discussed above, for al
though it is meant to be a com
edy, The Statue winds up as 
a tear-jerker as any sensitive 
person is very likely to leave 
the theater in tears over this 
film and the money he wasted 
to see it.
Doctors Wives is a good ex
ample of what a studio will do 
when it has several minor stars 
sitting around drawing salaries. 
Since movie production has fall
en off due to the recession 
among other things, supposedly 
the best and chespest way to get 
these faces in front of the pub
lic is to put them all into one 
film. While none of them could 
carry a vehicle by themselves, all 
of them should be able to do the 
job if they are helped along with 
a little graphic living color sur
gery and the mention of some 
illicit sex and plain old fooling 
around between husbands and 
wives who are married, but not 
to each other.
Columbia followed this routine 
and came up with a film which 
is neither very sexy or very good. 
Full of promises, the movie fails 
to deliver even enough nude 
scenes to keep the audiences 
interest aroused. Dyan Cannon 
provides the only real entice
ment to stay in the theater, but 
screenwriter Daniel Taradash 
and director George Schaefer 
must harbor some secret death 
wish because they manage to 
kill her off within the first fif
teen minutes. After that the film 
continues, but nobody really 
cares. So what if doctors cheat 
on their wives and vice-versa? 
Considering the personalities 
shown in this film, its a small 
wonder that any of them got 
a partner up the aisle in the first 
place.
Richard Crenna labors along 
under the weight of most of the 
plot, but he really isnt capable 
of supporting it. The ubiquitous 
Gene Hackman, who by this 
time must hold some sort of re
cord for the most appearances 
in lousy supporting roles, is also 
on hand, but then too there are
few Columbia pictures in which 
he is not present in some form 
or another. The rest of the cast 
includes Janice Rule, Diana 
Sands, Rachael Roberts, Car
roll OConnor, and some other 
people none of whom are very 
exciting or even memorable. 
The best performance of the pic
ture is turned in by John Cali
cos playing an utter bastard of a 
villain with such sophistication, 
elan, and self-confidence that 
it is a real shame that he doesnt 
get away with it.
Brother John is the name of 
the new Sidney Poitier film in 
which Poitier once again seems 
to be trying to recapture the exsence of what made In the Heat 
Of The Night such a good film. 
In his last effort, They Call Me 
Mister Tibbs!, he recreated the 
role of the detective he played 
in Heat, and in this film he 
returns to the South. Only this 
time Poitier finds no Rod Stei
ger, and the audience finds very 
little in the way of a plot or 
characterization to enjoy.
Poitiers role consists mainly 
of him sitting and looking pen
sive at what is transpiring around 
him. Occasionally he does open 
his mouth, but very little if 
anything memorable ever comes 
out. Brother John actually may 
be trying to really convey a mes
sage to its audience, but unfor
tunately James Goldstone who di
rected the film, and Ernest Kinoy who wrote the screenplay 
seem to be undecided as to what 
it is. Perhaps they had in mind 
a film patterned after Pasolinia 
Teorema with Poitier playing 
a sort of black, moral Terence 
Stamp. If such was the case, it 
is a shame that they didnt look 
more closely at the successes and 
flaws of Pasolinis film, for their 
vehicle appears to have ignored 
the former and gone on to cap
italize on and refine the latter.
Sidney Poitier will obviously 
be the selling point of this pic
ture, and it is a shame that the 
audience will get so little for 
their money. Lately Poitier has 
seldom given audiences as much 
as a glimpse of the fine acting 
ability he showed in his earlier 
efforts. In fact, he has not turn
ed in a thoroughly satisfying per
formance since he appeared in 
In The Heat Of The Night. 
In Brother John, Poitier does 
little that a robot or someone 
doing a very poor inititatior. of
a mannequin couldnt have 
accomplished.
A discussion of what happens 
in Brother John would prove 
fruitless, for not very much ac
tually does transpire, or for that 
matter, even gives an indication 
of being able to do so. The main 
mystery which keeps the film 
plodding along concerns just who 
is John, and what does he want. 
The clues to this are thinly scat
tered throughout the picture so 
that the audience can decide for 
themselves. Unfortunately, actor 
Poitier, director Goldstone, and 
scripter Kinoy succeed in making < 
the film so low-keyed and just 
plain dull that by the final 
credits, the audience could care 
less about whether he is a black 
Christ-figure, or merely a welltraveled weirdo whose leaving 
town on a Trailways bus is ac
companied by a symbolic gust 
of wind. The perceptive members 
of the audience are not surpris
ed by this, for they realized that 
this film was full of hot air all 
along.
In Get Carter, Michael 
Caine turns in what must be his 
best performance since Alfie, 
and in doing so nearly saves this 
motion picture. Caine plays a sad
istic employee of the London mob 
who goes up north to investigate 
the death of his brother. While 
there he creates more havoc and 
causes more people to become 
deceased than film goers have 
seen in a single picture in a long 
time.
As far as Caines performance 
goes, it is almost excellent, and 
easily makes Get Carter far 
better than all of the films pre
viously discussed above. The flaws 
in the film rest with director 
Mike Hodges and the screenplay 
with which he has to work. 
Hodges keeps the action going at 
a frantic pace while continually 
introducing the many characters 
involved in the overly compli
cated plot with the result being 
that very often the audience has 
trouble understanding who is do
ing what to whom and why. Ex
cept for Carter, there is very 
little character development so 
the audience sees a lot of action 
happening to a lot of people and 
he only vaguely understands 
why. To be sure, a thorough un
derstanding isnt necessary to 
fully appreciate the sadism and 
gore,but it would be nice to know

Nobody Knows 
The B ummers
Ive Seen
by TERENCE N. PALSO
Anyone who sees at least two 
first-run motion pictures a week 
is apt to see far more failures 
than success. This week this 
writer would like to discuss the 
films he has recently seen which 
were near misses, and those 
which never even came close.
The rash of two-handkerchiefforties-type films which Love 
Story infected the movie indus
try with has really begun to 
break out. One of the first at
tempts to cash in on this epi
demic was the Cinerama Releas
ing Corporations Fools. Star
ring Jason Robards and Catherine 
Ross, this film is the tender tale 
of a sweet young girl who falls 
in love with a grade B horror 
film star while she is separated 
and waiting divorce from her 
young millionaire husband.
Now, should the plot of this film 
sound a trifle bit far-fetched, 
maybe this film isnt for you, 
because this brief outline is easi
er to swallow than anything shown 
on the screen. In fact, about 
half-way through the film those 
members of the audience who 
are not utterly stupified that such 
a story would even be considered 
for filming will begin to wonder 
exactly who the title applies to 
Miss Ross and Mr. Robards for 
accepting the roles, Cinerama 
for releasing the film, the audi
ence for sitting there, or per
haps a little of each. Still, should 
anyone think that the film is 
really ridiculous, he has only to 
stick it out until the ending to 
find how far out of hand things 
can really get. The kindest thing 
that can be said about the films 
deus ex machina ending is that 
it effectively breaks up Ross and 
Robards.
Should Fools not be playing 
locally, do not fret for such care 
was taken to preserve its GP rat
ing that no doubt it will pop up 
on the idiot box very shortly. As 
a matter of fact, Fools con
tains far less offensive language 
than Love Story, and despite 
the fact that a great deal of 
time is spent between the sheets, 
the most revealing thing the audi
Andy
Warholpresents
Joe
Dallesandro
ence sees is the mole in one of 
Miss Rosss armpits.
Cinerama appears to have heav
ily committed itself to the forties 
fad, for it also released Say 
Hello To Yesterday. In this film 
Leonard Whiting (Romeo of a 
few years ago) plays a mod deni
zen of swinging London and its 
suburbs who decides to spend 
a day chasing around after Jean 
Simmons, a much older woman. 
Whiting makes a perfect ass of 
himself in this role, and Miss 
Simmons who definitely deserves 
much better (both in the way.of 
roles and seducers) appears to 
be too helpless for her own 
good.
This bunch of nothing pro
ceeds to its consumation in such 
a fashion that the audience be
gins to stop caring about whether 
or not it will ever take place. 
Unfortunately, it does and in an 
idiotically well-covered manner.
Alvin Rakoff not only directed 
this picture, but he also had the 
courage to own up to it in the 
credits. In all fairness it must 
be stated that Rakoff had very 
little in the way of a script to 
work with in the first place. No 
doubt the sight of a screen play 
that even manages to work the 
phrase Say hello to yesterday. 
into the dialogue is hardly the 
type of a vehicle to bring joy to 
the heart of a creative individ
ual, but Rakoff appears to have 
done little to make the whole 
thing at least tolerable. Instead, 
he opts for the sort of contriv
ance which ends a film by show
ing a huge bunch of balloons be
ing released symbolically into 
the London sky at night. It is a 
shame that the only print of this 
film wasnt tied to those baloons.
According to an old saying, the 
third times the charm, but per
haps Cinerama hasnt heard that 
for they have also released The 
Statue, a vehicle asking the 
question just whose genetalia did 
Verna Lisa put on a fully nude 
statue of her husband, David 
Niven? There are probably a few 
of you out there in readerland 
who are revolted by the thought 
of a film on such a subject. Well,

Editorial
Dear C.M.U.,
Ill be leaving soon now, and seeing as this is my last 
editorial I thought I should write you a farewell note. I 
wasnt going to write anything for this last issue, but being 
able to publish a parting message like this is a rare oppor
tunity and I guess I shouldnt pass it up. Besides, weve got 
to fill this space up with something.
Remember when you and I first met. You were called Car
negie Tech then. I thought you were pretty weird, not much 
like college was supposed to be. You cost a lot less then too.
I bet you never expected college to become such a hot 
spot politically. I mean, it used to be someplace where good 
clean cut kids just went, stayed for four years, and came out 
prepared (shall we say trained) for life. Come to think of 
it, thats where a lot of our little differences of opinion came 
from, over the difference between training and education. I 
always thought that you could just sit through being trained, 
put in your time and get out, but that education was some
thing that you couldnt and werent supposed to just sit 
through. Thats why I was always getting upset when I saw 
all those people around, who were supposed to be getting ed
ucated, just sitting around marking time. It never seemed to 
bother you, though.
Remember how neither of us thought the war would last 
long, much less last for five years. Well, funny thing about 
that.
Remember all the talking we did about innovative teach
ing methods, new programs, about education as individual 
development, about classroom teaching evaluations, about sil
ly naive things like community service. Funny thing about 
that too. None of it ever came to pass, did it? Seems like 
you were just putting me on all that time, saying students 
really should have a meaningful role in putting into the 
whole educational process, when you knew you were going 
to let it happen. Put a few token students on some commit
tees; let them hold meetings and all that jazz; keep em busy 
writing recommendations that get ignored. Dont get me 
wrong. I dont think our period of association was a waste 
of time. I mean, I got something out of it personally. I really 
did. I just wish, though, that I could point to at least one ac
complishment, one significant change or improvement thats 
come about while you and I have been together. Come to think 
about it, thats what amazes me the most, that there hasnt 
been any significant change in you, C.M.U., that while the 
shits been hitting the fan everywhere (I can use naughty 
words like that now that Im leaving), youve just kept on 
rolling along without hardly changing at all in five years. 
Well, thats a pretty good trick if you can keep it up. Good 
luck.
Its time to close this thing out, so a public farewell to 
thee, ole C-MU. Be kind to the poor bastard whose got this 
job next year.

The working conditions of the 
campus workers have deteriorat
ed to the point where we are 
obligated to speak out in their 
support. Our action comes as a 
result of meetings with campus 
workersmeetings which have 
alerted us to the fact that recent 
layoffs and cut backs in pay have 
affected 27 employees.
Campus workers reported that 
they were hired with the under
standing that they would not be 
laid off. Often this meant accept
ing lower wages with the promise 
of job security. Workers received 
low pay, but were assured of op
portunity for advancement to spe
cialized training programs.
Instead of acting on the promise 
to provide training programs, 
you, the administration, hired out
side contractors to do jobs that 
campus workers could have done 
as well. In those cases, where out
side workers and campus workers 
were employed on the same job, 
the campus workers received low
er pay.
We believe that you, the admin
istration, have attempted to di
vide the workers and students by 
pitting the two groups against one 
another on economic isses. Two 
examples of this tactic readily 
come to mind. First, the issue of 
maid servicegiven a choice be
tween substantially increased 
housing costs or cancellation of 
maid service, the students natur
al impulse was to vote against 
continued maid service. The word
ing of the questionnaire made no 
mention that the choice for dis
continuation meant depriving 
women workers of their jobs. You 
then informed the workers that 
the students had voted serveral of 
them out of their jobs. In the sec
ond example, you have attempt
ed to explain rising food contract 
prices to the students by pointing 
to the unionization of the cafe
teria workers. In reality, the cut
back in service has resulted in 
shorter work hours and a corres
ponding reduction in take-home 
payThese developments have led 
us to question the Universitys fi
nancial policies. Are you, the ad
ministration, using the cry of 
out of money to attempt to jus
tify lay-offs of campus workers, 
cut-backs in student services, and 
the increase in tuition? If the Uni
versity is really out of money, 
why have you hired new and un-1 
needed supervisory personnel at 
annual salaries high enough to 
employ three workers?
We believe it is your responsi
bility as the Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity administration to openly 
and publicly provide explanations 
for your actions.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
POSTERS
The C-MU Student Senate pass
ed a motion today concerning the 
recent removal and destruction of 
posters advertising campus activ
ities. I would appreciate it if you 
would print it verbatim in an ap
propriate (meaning noticeable) 
space in the Tartan, since it con
cerns the entire C-MU population. 
The motion reads:
Whereas it is becoming in
creasingly more difficult to pub
licize and promote events be
cause posters are being removed 
and destroyed at an increasing 
rate;
Whereas the number of manhours spent publicizing an event is 
directly proportional to the 
amount of attention the event re
ceives;
Whereas the event may rep
resent a sizable financial obliga
tion to an organization or individ
ual and whereas the attendance
at any events is directly propor
tional to the amount of publicity it 
receives;
The Student Senate of C-MU 
on behalf of all students and Stu
dent Government supported or
ganizations request that C-MU 
students do not remove or destroy 
posters on campus until the event 
is over.

by MICHAEL JOHN HARBADIN
Big. Black. Bold. Boss of the 
blues. Thats B. B. King, born Ril
ey B. King, 44 years ago on a 
plantation near Indianoloa, Miss. 
He worked on farms picking cot
ton for 35 cents every hundred 
pounds and managed to learn how 
to play guitar from a preacher un
cle when he was about 14. Riley 
continued to play for church serv
ices and local dance halls until he 
was 22; then he moved to Mem
phis and got a job as a disc jockey 
and singer on the local black-staff
ed station, WDIA.
In time, Riley built up a reputa
tion on the air and also with his 
new trio, playing one-nighters in 
the Memphis area. He earned the 
name The Beale Street Blues 
Boy, which was shortened to 
Blues Boy, and then finally to 
B.B. Record companies began 
to take an interest in him, and in 
1949, B.B. recorded Lowell Fulsons Three OClock Blues for 
RPM Records. It was his first hit; 
it climbed to the top of the Rhythm 
and Blues charts in 1950 and stay
ed there for 18 weeks.
From there B.B. began a dec
ade of recording sessions, onenight stands (324 in one year), and 
dedicated blues-busting that at
tained him a lofty perch in the 
ranks of great bluesmen. During 
this time, he was known largely to 
black audiences, and it was not 
until the middle sixties that he 
gained recognition with white au
diences, as he played places like 
the Filmore West, the Newport 
Jazz Festival, Las Vegas, and 
Carnegie Hall.
The climax of his recent suc
cess came just two weeks ago, 
when he received a Grammy 
Award (The Best Rhythm and 
Blues Vocal by a Male) for his 
fantastic The Thrill Is Gone. 
(From his Completely Well al
bum.) The most important aspect 
of his recent recognition by the 
record industry and record buying 
public is that his albums will get 
more air play and promotion, ed
ucating the ears of people previ
ously unexposed to the sound of 
good, clean, hard blues. The real 
stuff.
However, this is not the essen
tial consequence of the influence 
of the Blues Boss. His style of 
guitar has influenced every gui
tar player living today. Mike 
Bloomfield once remarked: I 
come from B.B. King, man.
Even if youve never heard B.B. 
play (and you should have), 
youve heard a thousand varia
tions on his style coming from the 
fingers of every rock and blues 
guitarist who ever pulled a riff.
Deriving his style of singing and 
playing from such country-basic 
blues immortals such as Blind 
Lemon Jefferson, Robert John
son (who wrote Crossroads), 
Bukka White (B. B.s cousin), El
more James and T-Bond Walker, 
B. B. recalls that some of them 
used a slide, but I could never do 
that. The closest I could get to 
that sound was through trilling 
with my hand. That would make 
the notes sustain.
In the late fifties, B. B. began 
punctuating phrases by bend
ing notes. He would hit a note, 
press the string across the frets 
to raise the pitch, and hang on it 
to climax the phrase. Utilizing 
these two left-hand techniques, 
B. B. bypassed any sort of elec
tronic augmentation (tremeloes, 
reverb, etc.) and developed a bas
ic guitar phrasing that is pure and 
simple in its derivation from the 
classic basic blues, yet contemporaeneously complex in its 
adaptation and progression into 
the electric, orchestrated urban 
blues that is B. B. King today.
You can just feel the intensity 
as he plays. You know that he is 
playing what he has learned and 
developed through the years. He 
seems to cherish every note, ev
ery riff, as they are carefully 
chosen and felt through his fin
gers. He almost seems to regret 
releasing the sounds, as they are 
so much a part of him; they are 
all his own. It is simply B. B. King.
And then there is that voice. 
Yes, that persuasive, honest-toGod, road of life, throaty sound 
that can pass from softly cajoling 
nuances to definative, gutsy, grit
ty wails in the space of a single 
line. His phrasingvocal and in
strumentalare similar in many 
ways. B. B. has often said that he 
regards his voice as another in
strument, and has always tried 
to phrase his singing and playing 
similarly. And he succeeds, com
bining two basically different 
sounds into a cohesive, dynamic 
force that is the impetus behind 
and the mainstay of black blues 
today.
When I first got the blues, they 
brough me over on a ship.
Men was standing over me, and a 
lot more with a whip,
And everybody want to know, why 
I sing the blue s.
Well ive been around a long time, 
Ive really paid my dues.
Hell sing it and youll believe it 
because its the truth. Saturday. 
April 24, in the Carnegie Music 
Hall. B. B. Kingthe Boss of the 
Bluesbrought to you by the Ac
tivities Board.

an opportunity to participate in lottsa great stuff. There is the kite 
flying contest, the frisbee throwing contest, the march on Wash

on the way to a 6-4 season mark.
This year he expects the team to 
set at least five more records. 
Top new prospect is quarter miler 
Tony McKay. The Compton, Cal., 
freshman has already been timed 
in 48.3 for the quarter. Another 
freshman, Greg Dewey, from Mt. 
Lebanon, who set several cross 
country course records last fall, 
should lead the distance runners. 
A third freshman, Ray Willis, 
from Yonkers, N. Y., was ranked 
among the top ten high school 
triple jumpers in the country last 
year, according to ATHLETIC 
JOURNAL. Leading returnees are 
junior Mark Erskin, holder of the 
C-MU pole vaulting record and 
sprinter Dave Venzie. The Tartan 
thinclads will hold their first 
home meet April 7 against Alle
gheny Community College, South 
Campus, at 3:30 p.m.
The C-MU golf team opens its 
season Thursday, April 1, against 
Pitt, away. Coach Bill Rogers 
team has three solid returnees 
but lacks depth. Returning lettermen are Sam Janis, Scott Murray 
and Dave Borkovic. Last years 
record was 1-9.

PERFECT SEASON
AUTOCROSS SQUELCHES 
CAMPUS APATHY
by CHUCK MUSKIN
This past Sunday, March 28, the 
C-MU Sports Car Club held an 
autocross in Skibo Parking Lot. 
The event, with Chairman Chuck 
Muskin, drew 56 participants with 
a wide variety^ of cars and an es
timated 500 C-MU spectators. 
The crowd probably enjoyed the 
event as much as the drivers.
An autocross is a time trial 
event. A course is set in using py
lons (rubber cones) and the driv
ers must follow the course going 
as fast as they can. Any pylons hit 
add penalty time to his run.
The cars are divided into two 
categories: 1) STOCK, as they 
come from the show room, and 
2) MODIFIED, with racing tires,
prepared engines, etc. These two 
categories are then divided into 
smaller classes.
C-MU sophomore Carl Jernstedt took first place in the modi
fied class with his Fiat 124. Sev
eral other students tried their 
luck, but unlike Carl, do not have 
experience and so did not fare 
well. Autcrossing is the kind of 
sport where experience is neces
sary before the trophies start 
coming in.
Because of this great success 
of the event, the club plans to do 
this again, hopefully next fall.
The club would like to give a 
special thanks to Dean Swank and 
Security, who made it all possible.
EDITORIAL

The termination of the intram
ural basketball league marked the 
end of a bad season. Im afraid it 
all started with a misevaluation 
of the teams in the beginning. This 
led to unbalanced leagues with a 
number of better teams grouped 
into one league. Some of the bet
ter teams should have been the 
ones in the finals. So, in a sense, 
the playoffs were a bit of a farce, 
and once again, the season was 
blotted with the old if you cant 
beat em, figure out a way to dis
qualify em think (quote from 
Stork). Lets hope things work 
out differently next year.
This week weve included some 
outdated sports (i.e., wrestling) 
since there hasnt been a sports 
page for the past two weeks.
TARTAN sports page has fol
lowed a certain tradition. There 
have been girl sports editors as 
well as boys, but the results have 
been pretty much the same. 
Theyve all followed a certain pat
tern, making a half-hearted effort 
at turning out a decent page. Not 
only is the page going to look bet
ter graphically, but there will be 
a real effort to get decent report
ers for all sports. In fact, look for 
some really good developments 
in the construction of the entire 
paper. What can I say? Time for 
change.
Dont miss the first match of 
our super tennis team this Thurs
day, April 1, home. It could be a 
second straight undefeated sea
son for Coach Dave Lichtman and 
assistant March Krotee.
In the land of 
the half-ass, 
the asshole 
is King.

The wrestling team finished 
the season on a hopeful note 
Thursday, March 5, against Gan
non College in Erie, Pa. Though 
losing the meet, 25-14, the grapplers won four of the six matches 
that were contested. George Wargo wrestled up a weight class at 
126. Though outweighed, George 
did fairly well until he was turned 
over on his back late in the second 
period. Allen Kohan won 7-4 at 134. 
Unable to pin his opponent, Allen 
scored a near fall and built up an 
excessive amount of riding time.
At 142, Tom Dillen, not fully re
covered from a shoulder injury, 
took his man down and pinned him 
1:14 into the first period. Need
less to say, he was impressive. 
Pete definitely had his man pin
ned on three different occasions, 
but the ref was quite nonchalant 
about the match, taking his time 
getting from one side of the mat to 
the other. At 158, Vic Rogers won 
his second straight match. He 
pinned his man the previous week 
against Bethany, as he outpointed 
his opponent, 9-6. Trailing 4-2 af
ter the first period, Vic scored a 
predicament and built up riding 
time in the second period. In the 
third period, Vic escaped, but was 
then taken down by the man from 
Gannon. Vic then executed a re
versal and saved his victory. Due 
to injury and class conflict, 167, 
177, and 190 were forfeited to 
Gannon. Heavyweight Dave Lurie 
showed better moves than pre
viously, but he was pinned in the 
second period.
The wrestling team ended its 
first season without a victory. 
Continuous improvement was evi
dent throughout the season, how
ever. Next year virtually all of 
this years team will be back in 
addition to the influx of freshman 
wrestlers. Coach Paul Steva look
ed very well with the team this 
year. Having adjusted to the ath
letic environment at C-MU and 
eager to better his record next 
year, Coach Steva along with As
sistant Coach Leonard Jones look 
forward to a much improved team 
next year.

To Build SST
Shortly after purchasing super
sonic transport plans from the 
United States, officials of Japans 
huge Kamakazie Aircraft Corpor
ation announced that shortly 
their company would begin to 
market a miniature transistorized 
version of the SST. Designed for 
private ownership, the plane 
should be just the thing for any
one with a long driveway. Offi
cials state that the plane will be 
a boon to commuters in that it 
will help alleviate rush hour traf
fic by cutting commuting time 
to an average of twenty-five sec
onds one way.
The planes considerably re
duced size will also eliminate
parking problems since it is 
completely portable. Once the 
commuter arrives at his destina
tion, he will find that the plane 
easily folds into an atrractivelymonogrammed-imitation-alligator 
attache case. This portable super 
sonic transport, or PSST as the 
company refers to it, will be able 
to fly on regular fuel while get
ting around forty-three and two 
thirds miles per gallon.
Officials were quick to assure 
reporters that no sonic boom will 
follow the plane across the land
scape. Due to the planes small 
size, instead of an annoying 
boom the PSST will emit a 
rather pleasant popping sound 
as it (Continued on page 24).

Today at a lavish press con
ference members of the big three 
auto makers introduced a com
pletely pollution free automobile 
and thereby beat a congressional 
deadline by more than twenty 
months. The car, called The 
Daisy, promises to leave the at
mosphere as fresh as its name
sake.
Reporters invited to test drive 
the car were disappointed in its 
performance, however. Its just 
too damn hard peddling up hills, 
said one. Other comments ranged

Disaster Hits 
Los Angeles!
If Tragedy struck Los Angeles 
during the afternoon rush hour 
today at 5:33 E.S.T. when the 
smog filled air which has shroud
ed the city for years mysteri
ously solidified thereby killing 
the entire population of the city 
who were trapped inside. Re
placing the city is a solid black 
mass of smog.
After expressing his deepest 
regrets at a hastily called press 
conference, Governor Ronald Rea
gan said that his office will do 
everything possible to see that 
this sort of ecological disaster
which the FARTAN, obviously 
doesnt even know exist. They 
should play fair and stop making 
us the butt of their jokes. We try 
very hard, and to our knowledge 
not one student who patronizes 
us has ever died of malnutrition. 
The FARTAN should be nicer 
to us, and should especially stop 
criticizing our coffee. After all, 
those FARTAN reporters are 
bound to be old and weak some
day too, and then how will they 
like it when (Continued on page

Obscenity
Allegheny County District 
Attorney John Duggan who earl
ier this month raided the mens 
room opposite the TARTAN of
fice in Skibo and confiscated 
the walls and dividers charging 
that They are ruinous to the 
minds of impressionable univer
sity students in that the students 
are forced to stand or sit and 
stare at filthy obscenities and 
libelous treasons on the average 
of three or four times a day, 
thereby constituting an effec
tive brainwashing, was ordered 
by the State Supreme Court to 
repace the walls and dividers

but also on the

vacy by three students who were

Jimmy The Swede Olsen, 
former president of the Alle

the office of Editor-in-Chief of 
the Fartan, this past Tuesday.
Jimmy is a sophomoric English 
major at Mellon-Rockefeller Com
munity College. Next year, he 
plans to be a junior. The head 
of the English Department has 
denied reports of Olsens exist
ence.
Jimmy, known affectionately 
by his mother as, my son, and 
less affectionately by his conniv
ing staph as Zeus, has grand 
plans to reorganize the news

Dog Canary, former editurd in 
chief, was heard to comment. The 
printer has refused to continue 
putting out the rag (as it is af

standing part of Chief Olsens 
new editorial policy, all the news 
that fits will be painted on the 
front of Skibo.

In a nationally televised speech 
President Richard M. Nixon an
nounced to a stunned nation that 
the war in Southeast Asia should 
terminate shortly. The President 
based his announcement on cur
rent enemy dead figures released 
by the Pentagon. According to 
these figures, the total number 
of Viet Cong killed since 1961 
is only five less than the entire 
population of North Viet Nam, 
stated the President. Therefore 
we are devoting our full resources 
to apprehending these five tena
cious individuals, so that we can 
bring our boys home. It is indeed 
unfortunate, but necessary that 
these individuals be eliminated.
To pull out and permit them to 
wreak havoc on the people of 
the South, is to endanger the en
tire Asian continent, Mr. Nixon 
told the country.
At the Pentagon, however, of
ficials sharply criticized the 
Presidents speech as being over
ly optimistic about terminating 
the war. After all, said a spokes
man, there are a great many 
places where these individuals 
can hide and practice their hitand-run tactics. We will not 
feel safe until every tree, every 
plant, every blade of grassany
where where those lousy gooks 
can hide is destroyed beyond (Con
tinued on page 23).
