candidate. The fifth half term 
seat was tied between Richard 
Yalch and Donald Balenovitc. 
Each candidate received a total 
of seven votes.
In the College Council election, 
Arnold Millard, unopposed in the 
race for Rotating Departmental 
Representative (this year from 
the Chemistry Department) won 
his seat. Michael Stevens topped 
Philip Rosen for representativeat-large from CIT.
In the H&SS College Council, all 
six running candidates won their 
seats. Neil Talenfield and Stephen 
Hamm won the sophomore seats; 
Sue Peters and David Venzie, the 
junior seats, and Frank Cox and 
Tom Lee, the senior seats. Gor
don Pinsky edged Thomas Jeselnick for the MIS representativeat large seat. The Chemistry rep
resentative from MIS is James 
Teter. Rosanne Perlman and 
write-in candidate Joyce Baker 
captured the MMCC seats.
There seemed to be no trends 
or swings from right to left or 
vice versa in the recent elections, 
except for the growing apathy of 
students towards campus govern
ment as evidenced by the lack of 
candidates in the running and the 
sparse electoral turn-out. Hope
fully, the new senators will revive 
this lost student interest with 
successful terms next year.
The Student Senate Housing * 
Committee wants to see a large 
scale student owned and operated 
housing project built in the next 
few years by the Carnegie-Mellon 
Student Government Corporation 
or another student corporation 
that might be formed for the pure 
pose.
The housing project is envi
sioned as offering a variety of ac
commodations similar to off 
campus apartments, at a cost 
equal to, or lower than, present 
University housing.
This housing would be located 
on or nearby the campus. With the 
exception of a professional hous
ing manager (required for most 
loans), the housing will be man
aged and staffed by students. Ail 
routine maintenance is also to be 
done by students.
Some of the advantages of this 
type of housing are:
1) Closer understanding be
tween the operator and the ten
ants;
2) Lower rent due to lower op
erating cost because of the exten
sive use of student staff and main
tenance crews;
3) More flexibility in designing 
the housing;
4) No parietal regulations or re
strictions of any kind; will be run 
like private apartmentsdont 
destroy the place and dont bring 
in the cops and you can do what 
you want;
5) Tremendous opportunity for 
practical student experience in a 
full scale business operation. 
Hopefully this can be on a credit 
basis ;
6) Provides employment for 
many students in a variety of jobs;
7) Should cause great increase 
in student cohesiveness and in in
terest in student government. As 
a result of this project students 
will become much more indepen
dent of the University.
Their involvement in a multi
million dollar project will expose 
them to public scrutiny and make 
them more aware of their posi
tion as a significant economic 
force outside of the university.
Work is just starting on this 
project, so little in the way of 
specifics is available, but this 
much is known:
1) Student owned housing is 
in existence at several universi
ties;
2) The student government cor
poration that recently came into 
being can readily be used as a ve
hicle to provide housing ;
3) Financing is available.
The possibilities of student 
owned and operated housing are 
enormous. They range from a sin
gle 600 unit complext to small 10-
20 person units, to incorporation 
of educational facilities, providing 
services such as food and drug 
stores, restaurants, laundry and 
dry cleaning facilities, etc. Again, 
financing does not appear to be a 
major problem and the senate 
will not have to provide money for 
the project in any way.
To establish credibility for stu
dent operation of housing, the 
housing committee would like to 
have an arrangement made with 
the University whereby students 
would manage and operate a C-MU 
dorm, possibly the Margaret Mor
rison dorms, for the fall semes
ter, 1971. The University is inter
ested but they are not commiting 
themselves to anything at the pre
sent.
A housing project such as that 
envisioned by the housing com
mittee will be by far the biggest 
project accomplished by this stu
dent government and quite possi
bly by any student government in 
the country. It will set national 
precedence.
Students interested in helping 
should contact John Gross, chair
man of the Housing Committee, 
immediately. A lot of investiga
tion and negotiation needs to be 
done in the next few weeks and 
over the summer.

STUDENT SENATE
by MARGARET WACKER
The greater part of the Student Senate meeting was devoted to 
reviewing the report of Sundays Budget Appeals Hearing.
The report listed recommendations for the allocation of funds to 13 
campus organizations. Budgets were discussed and voted on one by 
one. The voting went smoothly and each motion passed until Senate 
considered the budget allocation for the Revolutionary Alliance.
An endless amount of time was spent with this, discussing whether 
the Revolutionary Alliance should receive any budget at all. A motion 
to reduce its allocation to $0.00 was made but defeated. After heated 
argument, the Revolutionary Alliance was granted its original alloca
tion of $600.
Aside from the budgetary issue, little else was discussed at the 
meeting. After budget voting. Senators left, and the meeting was ad
journed for lack of a quorum.

NEW STUDENT Government President Vince Misitano gloats over his 
victory landslide.
Student Government 
Elections Completed
by DUANE EILERTSON
The Student Senate elections 
were held this last Monday and 
Tuesday with some surprising 
turns of events. The Student Sen
ate presidential race which seem
ed a conclusive Misitano win a 
week ago, gained a little interest 
with a sudden writ-in campaign by 
former MDC President Sam Frenkil. Although Vince Misitano won 
with a total of 589 vote, the Frenkil campaign stole 40 votes from 
his tally.
The race for Director of Aca
demic Affairs was tight with pre
sent director Terry Zaluska fin
ally leading heavily with a total of 
439 votes to her opponent Messervys 291 votes.
Dennis Brandi was elected un
opposed as president of the Car
negie Commuter Council.
Student Senate seats in the fra
ternity constituency were won by 
Jeff LaRochelle, John Bell and 
Donald Dietrich. Mark Winters 
was elected to a half term seat.
In the MDC constituency, Dale 
Seim, who has been on the Stu
dent Senate since last falls elec
tions, retained his seat. Michael 
Jones, running on a peace, rights 
and recycling platform was elect
ed for a full term. Willie Roy 
Thompson, who advocated 
changes in college structure and 
requirements, also won a full 
term seat. Harry Sirockman was 
elected for a half term seat.
All five of the five candidates in 
the AWS constituency, Joan Kodish, Linda Arnold, Jude Heller, 
Leigh Larson and Evelyne Pohl 
(half term), captured their Sen
ate seats.
All candidates for commuter 
seats, Bob Skena, Mike Garl, Ar
nold Millard and Edward Stoker 
met success, except candidate 
Myron Staroschak.
An interesting phenomenon occured in the graduate elections. 
Graduate voting turn-outs have 
been notoriously poor every year. 
This year, the three candidates 
who ran three of the five Senate 
seats, Stelios Papadopoulos, Judy 
Parkman and Murray Singer, 
won. Robert Sundelin was elected 
to the fourth seat as a write-in
Food, Housing Decisions
A decision has been made concerning the rates and conditions of 
campus housing and food service for the coming academic year. In a 
recent questionnaire sent to all residents of the C-MU dorms the Com
mittee on Auxiliary Services presented several options for future 
modes of food and housing service. The students were to denote their 
preferences between two plans each for housing and food service. The 
results of the survey are in, and the plans chosen areas follows, quoted 
verbatim from the questionnaire:
Fifty-six per cent of the students returning questionnaires prefer
red food service option B.: All undergraduate residents of campus 
housing except those electing to live at Mudge Graduate House in the 
spaces which are available there would be free to choose from the full 
range of contract services now available. Each of those contracts would 
(will) cost $60 per semester more for the academic year 1971-72. 
The contract options and prices available to undergraduates for 1971- 
72, therefore, would (will) be: Undergraduate women five-day15 
meal contract$330; seven-day21 meal contract$350. In order 
to maintain this range of options, it would be necessary for food serv
ice management to reserve the right to change the conditions and lo
cations of service in order to adjust for unanticipated changes in operaating cost and demand.
Housing option A is to be adopted, being desired by 88 per cent of 
Morewood Garden residents and 72 per cent of those presently abiding 
in the hill dorms. Plan A provides for no change in the rate for 1971- 
72. A condition of this rate, however, will be the withdrawal of the week
ly maid service in each resident room.

EditorialLETTERS TO THE EDITOR
If we assume that there is a community here, that this 
intangible sense of community is to be encouraged for the 
good of educational goals, and that the nature of this com
munity is evolving and changing, what then, is the faculty's 
role in all this.
To examine this question, let us make the abhorrent men
tal leap of drawing an extended analogy between the univer
sity and a real world corporation of equal size, (to do such 
I will refrain from the position that the academic commun
ity is more political and more corrupt than the so called real 
world). Now, there are three major groups exerting influence 
on modern corporations; management and its stockholders, 
labor, and consumers. Correspondingly, the university has the 
administration and its trustees, the faculty and staff, and the 
students. While it may be distasteful to those of us with sen
sitive egos to consider the faculty as labor and the students 
as consumers, let it ride for purposes of analogy, as the func
tions are similar enough (the accusation of education factory 
is common enough). In the recent past we have seen the as
cendancy of organized labor as a major force in the work
ings of the modern corporation. But this movement has cur
iously bypassed the internal workings of the university, as it 
has almost all technically trained labor.
Most recently we have seen the beginnings of a strong 
consumer movement, effective mainly through government 
regulation, with a virulent but unorganized counterpart on 
campuses among students.
These three groups, by and large determine or strongly 
influence corporate policy and action. Consensus between 
them must be reached before almost any action is taken. In 
the university, however, labor and consumer remain in the 
purely advisory position of the permissively repressed. Fringe 
benefits are withdrawn from the faculty, housing assessments 
are placed on the students, projects and courses are dumped, 
and all the two groups can do is complain and take it.
So what is the point of all this gross generalization? 
Simply this message: As the university community evolves 
toward a tripartite organization, those groups that are the 
most organized will carry the most weight. Obviously the 
administration is the best organized, and students are excru
ciatingly moving toward organizing themselves. Now is the 
time for the faculty and staff to lay the ground work for 
taking on more responsibility in the future, or run the risk 
of being left out.

HOUSING
Editor, The TARTAN:
I read with growing choler the 
article (TARTAN, March 4, 1971) 
on the $50 penalty assessed stu
dents in double rooms who lost 
their roommates for the course of 
the year. As I understand it, the 
penalty is one which was adopted 
after the beginning of the school 
year, so it was not in effect when 
contracts for housing were let. It 
would appear that the penalty is 
an outright violation of the con
tract, for which remedy may be 
available by an appropriate law
suit against the school.
For this purpose, those students 
affected by the penalty would do 
well to get together and speak 
with a lawyer regarding the mer
its of their case. The Lawyer Re
ferral Service of the Allegheny 
County Bar Association, CityCounty Building, phone 261-0518, 
will refer possible clients to a 
lawyer who provides a half-hour of 
his time for a nominal fee of five 
dollars. It is money well spent.
Since I do not have a copy of the 
actual housing contract, I cannot 
say more on the merits of the 
case; nevertheless, it appears in 
this case that unless the affected 
students fight back in court, the 
school is going to take from them 
what it thinks it can get away 
with, for something over which 
the students have virtually no 
control and for which the school 
has acknowledged responsibility 
(namely, room assignments). The 
students case appears to this 
reader very good.
Yours truly

Editor, The TARTAN.
Regarding your issue of March
4, there was a poem printed, sup
posedly by Sun Hee Kim. Since I 
am Sun Hee Kim and have never 
seen the poem before in my life, 
there is some mistake.
I would appreciate it very much 
if you would clear this matter up.
Out of curiosity, I would also 
like to know who submitted that 
poem.
Thank you very much, 
Sun Hee Kim

Midsummer's
The production of A MIDSUM
MERS NIGHT DREAM, at the 
t University of Pittsburgh provides 
an enjoyable evening for college 
theater goers. The staging is good 
and both the direction and acting 
reflect a good understanding of 
the play.
The rustic scenes are directed 
quite competently. Notable was 
Greg Lehane, who played the part 
of Bottom and executes the part 
? with imagination and a good sense 
' of comic timing. Frank Serrao, as 
Snug the Joiner, and the Lion in 
the play within a play does a com
mendable job and was quite fun
ny.
The scenes of the lovers should 
be comical. However, they areI
 not. The problem lies in untrain
ed actors attempting classical 
theater. Shakespeare is obvious
ly one of the higheit forms of the
ater and excellent training is 
needed in voice, speech and move
ment. The execution of the works 
by the actor, especially in the 
love scenes, is sloppy. I am quite 
amazed, for example, to find that 
Shakespeare had given Lysander 
a Brooklyn accent. The only lover 
that had good sense of the rhythms 
and iambic pentameter invested 
^ in the beautiful poetry is Valerie 
Oiotky as Helena, although her 
commendable acting ability could 
not save the scenes. The love 
scenes are also in need of strong
er ensemble work and a better

rapport between the four actors 
and actresses.
The performance of Puck (that 
shrews and knavish sprite) 
is a great disappointment. There 
seems to be a lack of imagination 
in the role. Worst of all, the audi
ence does not grow to love Puck 
but rather watches how cute the 
actor thought he was on stage.
The staging is rather clever ex
cept for the fairy scenes, in which 
passages of Shakespeare are sung
by the fairies. The audience could 
not hear the songs clearly and the 
dances are amateurish. Overall, 
however, the staging is imagina
tive and one sees that the direc
tor has good technical ability.
Throughout the play one is 
aware of the actors love of the 
work and the enjoyment of being 
on stage, and their sense of fun is 
to be commended. The level of in
tensity and enjoyment throughout 
the play is worthwhile and as said 
before, college theater goers are 
bound to enjoy this production.
The C-MU Peace Treaty Com
mittee has been enthusiastically 
growing and planning in anticipa
tion of a renewed spring offen
sive against the continuing Indo
china War. The time is just about 
upon us now when we are all go
ing to have to show the govern
ment our determination does per
sist, despite the illusionment they 
attempt to spread. At an National 
Student Association Conference in 
Ann Arbor in February, the anti
war movement officially pledged 
to support and implement the 
Peace Treaty between the Peoples 
of the United States and Vietnam. 
Therefore, if you havent person
ally ratified the treaty yet for 
some reason, drop by our litera
ture table in Baker Hall lobby and 
discuss it with us.
Once ratified, the treaty can be 
more than just another paperif 
we implement it. The weekend of 
April 2-4 we must start to do 
just that! On Friday, plans now 
call for a school moratorium; fol*
lowed on Saturday by a city-wide 
demonstration. Buses should be 
available for all of us to go to a 
massive rally in Harrisburg on 
Sunday to protest the Berrigan 
Brothers trial there as well as 
to hold in remembrance the assasination of Martin Luther King 
three years ago. Then, the follow
ing weeksorganizations through
out the city are planning local ac
tivities of all natures.
All of this will be leading up to 
the demonstration in Washington 
on the weekend of April 24; only 
the start of almost perpetual beseige of that city through the 
summer! If you have any ques
tions or ideas please plan to come 
to our last planning session on 
Wednesday, March 24, 4:30 p.m. 
in the Wherett room of Skibo. For 
that matter, if you would possi
bly be available for some work in 
organizing these activities, wed 
love to see you then anyway.

Reidboard Strike
The Amalgamated Clothing 
Workers Union (AFL-CIO) has 
been on strike against Reidboard 
Brothers Clothing Manufacturers 
since Sept. 7, 1970. The strike was 
provoked by unfair labor prac
tices. Reidboards policies have 
included no wage increases with
out government pressure on the 
clothing industry and time re
strictions on rest room use.
In the face of the strike, Reid
board has attempted to continue 
normal production by using scab 
labor. However, this practice has 
not met with complete success 
the work force is only half its nor
mal size.

Here come 
the meek 
to inherit 
the earth!
The uneducatedto fill our 
schools. The unemployed 
to take over key jobs. The 
unfedto eat their share of 
our bread. The underhoused 
to live in decency and dig
nity. The humble ones are 
comingby the billionsto 
become a part of the human 
race. Today.
Are you in 
or are you out?
Either way, change such as 
mankind has never experi
enced before will be your lot. 
Quakers think all men have 
something of God in them. 
Therefore change which 
allows each individual to 
share the human experience 
more fully is a blessed thing. 
Isnt this what the meek 
really have to inherit?
If you're concerned with 'the 
inalienable rights with which 
all men have been endowed 
by their Creator, you may be 
interested in the Quaker ap
proach to social change. We 
have some free and quite read
able leaflets which we'll gladly 
send. Just use the coupon below.
