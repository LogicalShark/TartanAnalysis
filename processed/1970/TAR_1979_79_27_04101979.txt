has happened since
Early Saturday morning, a maintenance 
worker discovered that the basement of 
Morewood D-lower had been vandalized. 
An initial inspection found that six win
dows had been smashed, a housekeeping 
office was broken' into, three washing 
machines were overturned and a firehose 
was turned on. Furthermore, the area 
where sororities and SDC store their 
booths.
This occurence is the latest of a recent 
rash of vandalism that has mainly focused 
on the sororities. Several weeks ago, Kappa 
Kappa Gammas booth was damaged in the 
basement. On April 2, a large amount of 
lumber belonging t.o Delta Gamma was 
stolen. The lumber was later discovered in 
the wooded area behind Doherty House. 
CMU Security Sargeant Armand Castelli 
speculated that if a group on campus had 
stolen the lumber, they threw it in the 
woods to get rid of it because it was clearly 
marked DG. ,
Castelli said that Security has added 
extra patrols to help keep the booth 
equipment safe. But the major problem is 
there is no one working in the basement 
from midnight to 7 AM. Castelli also added 
that all the incidents were probably, but 
not necessarily, done by the same people.
Anita Slane, president of the Tri-Delts, surveys 
damage done to their tooth.
One Tri Delt said that when she came 
into Morewood on Friday night, the main 
door was propped wide open and no one 
was sitting at the desk. The Tri Delts are 
making an itemized list of their damages 
and will give it to Housing Director Gerald 
Dalton, in hopes that Housing will reim
burse them for their losses.

It was almost embarrassing, a TAR
TAN staffer commented on Saturday. We 
just kept going up to the podium to get awards. We were hardly back in our seats be
fore it was time to get up again.
Humbleness notwithstanding, Saturday 
was a big day for the TARTAN. At the 
Pennsylvania Collegiate Press Association 
Convention in West Chester, Pa.,. CMUs 
newspaper won 11 awards, more than any 
other school in the state. The TARTANs 
closest competitor was The Pitt News, 
(University of Pittsburgh) followed by 
The Collegian (LaSalle College).,
Jeff Zaslow, who recently completed 
his term as Editor-in-chief of the TAR
TAN, won first prize in the Feature Writing 
Category. Feature Writing was the most 
crowded field in the contest (109 entries 
from twenty schools), and Zaslow won for 
his FOLIO piece,l Was a Teenage Transfer 
Student. (February, 1978). The article 
was an autobiographical apology and ex
planation that detailed why he transferred 
to Columbia University in New York, only 
to return two weeks later.
In the Political Column Category, Fred 
Siegel also won a first place for his series 
on the Koreagate scandal (October. 1978).

pressed with Harts drawing of the old 
man with the flowing beard because it

On Monday. April 2, the City of Pitts
burgh began rebuilding Morewood Avenue 
between Fifth and Forbes Avenues. The 
project will see Morewood completely 
torn out and rebuilt along with the bord
ering curbs, and is expected to take 60 
days to complete.
According to Richard Pew of the De
partment of Public Works, the project is 
costing the city over $100,000. This is the 
first major work to be done to Morewood 
Avenue in over 40 years, and is necessary 
since the 'existing roadbed is considered in
adequate for the current traffic load and 
for PAT busses.
Along with rebuilding the street itself, 
the city is improving some of the ammenities along Morewood. The sidewalk from 
the Fraternities down to Fifth Avenue will 
be rebuilt. Under normal policy the owner 
of the property would be responsible for 
this type of reparation.
The city is rebuilding the curb along the 
sidewalks and three catch basins for the 
storm sewers. Unfortunately, three old 
trees that were dead and considered haz
ards had to be cut down.
Pew explained that the new roadbed 
will consist of an asphalt that the city feels 
has the greatest durability to the weather. 
The roadbed will consist of a 6 stone 
base, 9 concrete pad, 1^4 asphalt binder, 
and a VA asphalt wearing surface. The 
mixture to be used on Morewood will 
have more liquid in it than that which was 
used on Fifth Avenue in 1977, greatly re
ducing the possibilities of potholes form
ing.
The 1000 block of Morewood is the 
first phase of a $500,000 rebuilding of 
Morewood all the way to Ellsworth Aven
ue. The rest of the work is being delayed 
until the Center Avenue and Aiken Avenue 
bridges are rebuilt.

The 5% Hack job
How did the Senate Finance Committee balance next 
years Activities Fee budget? ...The decision of the Com
mittee was to call in the seven largest budgets and ask them 
to suggest a way of removing 5% from our subsidy of their 
budgets. Once the 5% was removed, the budget was then 
balanced. (Finance Committee 1979 Allocation Report).
Activities Board, the TARTAN, Forbes Street Gallery, 
and Rent-A-Tech are among the fourteen organizations 
which now must maintain their present activities and oper
ations next year with less money than they were allocated 
last year by Senate; AB and the TARTAN, for example, 
must each work with over $2000 less in subsidy allocation. 
If these organizations are to continue providing the same 
goods and services as they did this year, more money 
must be allocated.
Senate decided not to include on the general election bal
lot this spring a referendum which would determine if the 
students favored an increase in the Activities Fee. Based on 
previous years' results, Senate assumed that an increase 
would be overwhelmingly rejected.
The TARTAN supports an increase in the Activities Fee: 
Senate should pass a resolution to this effect, at tonights 
meeting so that it can be presented to the Trustees for con
sideration by the April 16 deadline. Each penny of the in
crease should be earmarked for a specific organization ac
count; for example, a two dollar increase would make up 
the TARTAN and AB losses in subsidy, and subsequently 
cover printing and technical costs for those organizations.
We believe the Senate acted in an irresponsible manner by 
not soliciting students' opinions through a referendum. We 
each buy the organizations goods and services by pay
ing the activities fee. It is up to each individual to decide 
how much those goods and services are worth to him/her, 
as well as to acknowledge the effects of inflation on costs 
and pricesthe efficient market hypothesis applied.
Clearly, other solutions to the budgeting problem exist. 
We will detail our suggestions in a future editorial. For the 
immediate future, if the big organizations are not to cut 
back on services currently offered, the Senate has to act on 
our proposal immediately. Next Tuesday will be too late.
Ripe as Ever
With this issue, the 1979-80 TARTAN editorial board 
takes charge. We have some fresh and exciting ideas, all of 
which we think will continue to improve the TARTAN 
thats gone before.
Within the next few weeks we will be experimenting with 
many aspects of the TARTAN: not only content and style, 
but also efficiency and organization. Ultimately, our goal is 
for the TARTAN to become more accessible to the CMU 
community.
First, the TARTAN has a new telephone answering ser
vice. Messages can be left by calling 578-2113. Any news 
scoops, ads or general information can be relayed to the 
staff through the answering service.
The TARTAN editorial policy will remain unchanged for 
the present: TARTAN editorials will be written and signed 
by the Editor-in-Chief or a member of the Editorial board 
with the understanding that the view is determined collec
tively  a majority agreement of the Board is mandatory. 
However, a change in the policy is being considered, begin
ning Fall 79. Any suggestions from the camous community 
would be helpful in creating a new style for the editorial 
column.The letters-to-the-editor section is a breeding ground 
for controversy, but it is also an important source for news 
stories and editorial ideas. If youve never written a letter, 
but have a compliment, complaint, or whatever, just type it 
up and mail it through campus mail, c/o TARTAN, Box 17. 
As long as letters are signed and written coherently, well 
try lo print them all. Names may be withheld upon request.
Finally, the TARTAN editorial board encourages anyone 
with an interest in writing, photography, art, business, 
typesetting, layout, design, sports, investigative reporting - 
you name it  to get in touch or stop by any weekend. The 
time to become a TARTAN staff member is now. Were a 
new bunch, ripe as ever to any new ideas that you might 
have. We re all excited about our new jobs at the TA R TAN. 
We hope you II take the time to see what all the excitement 
is about.

No Visible Means of Support 
Editor:
As Chairman of the Student 
Senate for the last two semesters I 
have noticed one problem that 
plagues Student Senate. That 
problem is the lack of student 
input to Senate. Rarely, have I 
seen more than a handful of 
people at a Senate meeting and 
many times there is no one at all. 
Recognizing the problem, Senate 
has recently decided to include in 
its agenda, a time for students to 
let us know whats bothering 
them and to tell us what they 
would like changed. We cant 
change things we dont know 
about so come and tell us. Senate 
meetings are every Tuesday at 7 
PM in the Wherrett Room, Skibo.
Whatever your problem, 
chances are, Student Senate can 
help you. Senate has recently 
received approval from the ad
ministration on changes for next 
years academic calendar to better 
facilitate the students needs.
They have done many other 
things in the past, but we need 
your input. So, come and tell us 
your opinions, problems, and 
complaints. Well listen, and well 
help. Just remember, every Tues
day, 7:00 PM in the Wherrett 
Room of Skibo.

---------------------------------------------------

In this letter President Cyert addresses the Ivy League question. View From The Top
I have realized that my fre
quent references to excellence and 
my high objectives for this univer
sity are occasionally misunder
stood. The most important reason 
for my wanting even greater quali
ty than we already have is to en
able Carnegie-Mellon to make 
even greater contributions to our 
society through its educational 
and research capabilities.
' The key to building a success
ful educational institution, how
ever, is to build on the strengths 
that exist rather than to copy 
some other school. The goal of 
the organizations leadership
should be to build a unique insti
tution.
When we were developing a 
philosophy for GSIA some thirty 
years ago we were told by many 
people to make GSIA like the 
Harvard Business School. That 
suggestion was a foolish one for 
innumerable reasons. The major 
point is, however, that had we 
been able to do a good job of 
copying the Harvard Business 
School we could at most have 
been second best. It is hard to 
beat the original with a copy. As 
it turned out we were able to 
build a school that had unique
characteristics at the time and 
Harvard later adopted many of 
the ideas that we had developed.
Thus it would be contrary to 
my own philosophy and experi
ence if I were interested in at
tempting to make Carnegie-Mellon 
University into an Ivy League 
school. In the first place I believe 
we are better than most of the 
Ivy League schools. We have more 
units that can lay claim to being 
among the top ten of their kind 
than any Ivy League school ex
cept perhaps Harvard. But invidi
ous comparisons are irrelevant. 
Carnegie-Mellon has a philosophy
of education that I believe is cor
rect. We emphasize the profes
sional aspects of education in 
everything we do. We have been 
able to develop an excellence in 
education and research that can 
be matched by relatively few insti
tutions and we are still improving. 
We have no need for the crutch of 
being like any particular school or 
belonging to any particular group. 
We stand alone and are proud of 
ouj; unique qualities. When others 
recognize our excellence, we are 
pleased. When they do not, we are 
not disturbed. We still retain our 
confidence because we are intemally motivated. We do not have to 
be told by someone outside the 
institution that we have quality 
inorder to feel secure.
Each individual, I believe, 
should have the same philosophy 
about himself or herself. Have 
your own goals and measure your 
performance against those goals. 
Learn from others but do not at
tempt to be somebody else. Each 
individual like each organization 
has unique and admirable quali
ties.
Polonius advise, to thine own 
self be true, was good advise for 
individuals and organizations.

veniences of dormitory life; bro
ken washers and dryers and cold 
water showers. There are still 
no cooking facilities to speak of. 
Conveniences I have come to 
expect from our loving drones at 
Housing. So I, like an idiot, gave 
them $100 in March of 1978 to 
save the room for another year.
1978 was the year CMU 
merged with Bell of PA and centrex began appearing around cam
pus. Housing had an ingenious 
plan for getting students to absorb 
the cost of centrex installation. 
They terrorized us. And they 
waited until they had our hundred 
dollars before beginning this cra
zy, criminal campaign. Im not go
ing to give all the gory details 
here. Briefly then.
My roommate and I didnt 
want centrex. We got along fine 
with the hall phone. It was our 
unmistakable legal perogative to 
refuse a centrex phone; we had 
signed a contract on the room andI
 could not be subjected to addi
tional expenses at the fancy of 
Housing. We woke up one morn
ing and found every hall phone 
ripped off the wall. Apparently 
there had been a memo; you 
know, one even the RA never 
saw. It seems the rent on these 
 pay phones could no longer be 
| tolerated by Housing so they had 
I to goovernight. They took us 
I for real suckers but we got,the 
I hall phones replaced until our 
I current contract expired. Now, 
I this year, every room has cen1 trex: I guess ours was installed 
I over the summer. You know 
I what really ticks me off? Those 
I hall phones are on the wall today.
Lately, the washers and dryers 
I are breaking down more than 
I ever. If I have to withstand one 
I more frozen shower, Im going 
to take the crooks to court if I 
have to and get some rent refund
ed. HEAR THAT BOYS!
Im mad as hell and Im not 
going to take it anymore. Oncampus housing is a convenience 
I can live without.I

Quiet, Please!
Editor:
As a daily user of the libraries 
on campus, I am upset at the 
number of inconsiderate people 
who misuse the facilities. Im 
Pointing my finger at the people 
who hold lengthy, audible conver
sations much to the distress of 
those around them. I have too 
often been annoyed, disturbed, 
an<^ frustrated while trying to do
my work.
I understand that there is 
limited separate space in which 
groups can work. But most 
often, those with group work are 
not the offenders. The people 
who offend me most are those 
who sit and gossip in the study 
areas. The majority of these 
chatterers, when politely asked, 
will tone down their discourse, 
but there are a few rude, obstinate 
people who cant shut up. Im 
tired of moving my belongings, 
books, and scribble sheets so that 
I can get peace and quiet. After 
all, a library is for reading and 
studying, n est-ce pas?
I hope that in the future, 
people will try to speak softer (if 
they have to speak at all). I also 
hope that those who have been as 
irritated as I am will stop reshuf
fling their papers and moving, and 
will ask the others to keep it 
down. Life isnt as bad if we all 
try to show some consideration 
for others.

What's That You Said? 
Editor:
I was happy to leam that Mr. 
Paul Henderson shares my con
cern over inadequate communica
tive skills among CMU students, 
but I cannot agree with his 
analysis of this maladys cause 
and cure.
In his letter to the TARTAN 
of 20 March 1979, Mr. Henderson 
shared with the avid readers of 
the Letters page(s) the story 
of the advanced level engineer
ing student who could not 
spell the word arrogant. The 
conclusion he offered was that 
CMUs engineering curriculum 
does not allow adequate time for 
courses which develop ones abil
ity to read, write, and speak 
effectively. Perhaps he is right. 
But to declare that education at 
CMU is debased unless students 
admitted with certain grade 
school level skills can be rehab
ilitated misses an important point.
The kind of training in the 
fundamentals of communication 
Mr. Henderson and I often find 
lacking must be developed before 
a student reaches the university 
level. If my experience is any 
indication, this training doesnt 
require another enormous federal 
program. Two determined high 
school teachers account for the 
greatest part of my training and 
continued interest in the ef
fective use of words. Their meth
ods were too basic to be found in
modern educational journals, but 
their students could not help 
but acquire the fundamentals 
Mr. Henderson and I feel so 
necessary. ^
The university faculty is not 
without its responsibilities, how
ever, regardless of department. 
Again, one professor-in Geology, 
of all courses-had a profound 
effect in keeping me from losing 
as an undergraduate what facility 
with words I had acquired in high 
school. I hope that faculty ad
visors here recognize each stu
dentss need for non-major
courses in this area, and that all 
instructors (and their teaching 
assistants) keep watch over the 
quality of written material sub
mitted to them. Meanwhile, may 
the Admissions Office be able to 
identify those applicants whose 
communicative deficiencies se
verely limits their opportunities 
for success at CMU.
I expect that would please 
both Mr. Henderson and me.

Editor:
The March 20 Letters to the 
TARTAN had a pretty hot item 
that ought to replace race rela
tions as the running debate topic 
for a few weeks. Maybe, like the 
Hackers letter, it was just a 
joke; that would be nice to 
believe. But Im afraid from the 
tone of it that it wasnt just a 
college prank.
It seems that the folks from 
Doherty D-6 are upset because 
some talented and hard-working 
folks from Fine Arts arranged 
the 1979 Beaux Arts Ball, and 
because a lot of folks from 
Fine Arts went to it and had a 
terrifically good time.
Doherty D-6 writes, It seems 
odd that other departments 
(sic) on this campus such as 
MIS, CIT, or AMS do not hold 
their own Balls (pun pardoned). 
For some reason, the Fine Arts 
people think that they should 
hold an exclusive affair of this 
type. Perhaps the people in 
Fine Arts think they exist on 
some level above the general 
campus. That, boys, is a non 
sequitur, or as your technolo
gical ilk put it, the premises do 
not support the conclusion. 
Nobody is stopping the MIS, 
CIT, or AMS communities from 
holding an annual, private ball. 
Get your acts together and you
can have a good time, too. Think 
of it: The High-Tech Hop. Stu
dents would arrive in costume 
(like jeans, t-shirt and blue windbreaker) to the roar of the theme 
from Star Wars. The entire 
Computation Center could be 
turned over to computer games. 
Reruns of Star Trek in the lecture 
halls.
But lets be serious! As Do
herty admonisheds, we are, after 
all, hard-working cab drivers, and 
some of us have $28,000 invested 
in our lips. The idea that the 
people in Fine Arts think they 
exist on some level above the 
general campus is a serious mis
take and needs to be corrected. 
Walk through our mildewed music 
practice rooms. Visit the over
flowing costume shops. Measure 
available studio space on the 
third floor. Then stroll over to 
Science Hall. Check out the 
graduate students offices, the 
quiet, roomy elevators (plural). 
Consider the money invested in 
computer hardware. I dont care 
what your major is: take a little 
tour like that and you wont 
think that Fine Arts people exist 
on a higher level. No, friends, 
were much lower than the rest 
of you, and we know it. We know 
it and accept it, just like we 
accept the idea that a lot of us 
will be driving cabs when were 
thirty.
But its hard for us to accept 
the idea that by having a good 
party were building walls 
between academic departments. 
Anyone who writes, Can you 
imagine paying $28,000 to leam 
to play the trombone? is a 
philistine, and philistinism is a lot 
more dangerous than beer, pot 
and dancing.
So go ahead, guys. Have 
yourselves a party. Live it up! 
We wont hold it against you.

Editor:
Recently you published a letter 
from someone who just felt like 
complaining. This seemed to spark 
off all sorts of trouble for the 
nerds (er...Hackers. Sorry about 
that, JP0M and the others). 
Well Im not going to talk about 
that. I figure, we need something 
like that again, so here we go with 
my set of gripes:
To begin with, who is the 
moron who programmed the 
Science Hall elevators? I have 
stood there waiting for 5 minutes
as two elevators sit on the third 
floor and the third passes right 
by me. Or else, all three are going 
down when I want to go up. 
WHY? Are they plotting against 
me? I dont have bad breath, do I?
As for Cyert, he deserves more 
trouble, so heres another hit 
for him: Does anybody remember 
the letter which we got the day 
after mid-semester break? He said 
something like, That was inter
esting. We ought to do it again 
sometime. This was amazing 
from two points: 1) That letter 
holds a new record for getting 
out. The mail has never been so 
fast since the pony express. 
Or was it written BEFORE 
break??? 2) Where does this guy 
get off, saying something like 
that? One day off from school, 
and he sounds like we took a 
whole MONTH off. Big deal.
Then there are the parking 
gates. Since Im a commuter, 
those things are a bitch-and-ahalf. Somebody must have an aw
fully screwed up grill from break
ing them off. Why doesnt Secur
ity put metal studs in them to 
ruin the paint of that guys car?
Also, I spent an arm and a 
leg paying for a parking permit. 1 
even put down a five dollar de
posit on a cute little card so that 
I could push it in the slot and 
open the gate. So what happens? 
Security leaves it open so that 
any body can park there. If its 
closed, you can just drive under 
it and it will open. Ive been 
ripped off!!!
How about the parking lots? 
When the army got through with 
mortar practice, why didn't some
body fill in the holes? I admit, 
they finally filled them in. But 
why didnt they check first to 
make sure they were empty? 
MY CAR IS STILL DOWN 
THERE!!!
Lets here it for the Science 
Hall vending area. One, two, 
three, BOOOO! Theyre never 
full, and they dont work when 
they are full. But the coffee 
machine really takes the cake.
I once put my money in it, then 
watched the coffee and cream 
come out and go down the drain 
because there wasnt any cup. 
Automation at its finest. Not only 
does it brew it and mix it, it 
drinks it for you too!
Why are letters to the editor 
always complaining about this 
or that? Why cant somebody 
tell a joke or talk about schenly 
park or something like that?

TARTAN Cleans Up
Continued from page 1
of one upmanship in student achievement, 
another conscience piece that reminds the 
readers what a university is really for. 
Jeff Zaslow picked up a second place in 
the General Columns Category for his piece 
in the VIEWS column, We Went Down
stairs for Breakfast. (October,1978). The 
VIEW dealt with what it was like to meet 
Herb Simon the day after he won the No
bel Prize. Zaslow also won an honorable 
mention for his editorial Playing Politics 
in the Political Column Category. The 
piece dealt with CMUs getting screwed 
by Thornburgh and Flaherty during the 
1978 gubernatorial campaign.
Lisa Amowitz, recently-elected FOLIO 
editor, won an honorable mention in the 
Cartooning Category for her FOLIO cover 
The Old CMU Grind. (October, 1978) 
Photographer Chris Morrow won an 
honorable mention for his gazorching 
photograph.
The convention itself was exciting for 
CMU's four delegates. After flying in to 
Philadelphia, the four conventioneers 
lunched in a millionares mansion. The 
mansion was recently donated to West 
Chester State College, sponsors of the con
vention, and rests on 640 acres of land (in
cluding seven lakes).
At the awards banquet Saturday even
ing, Jonathan Newman, Pulitzer Prize win
ning journalist for the Philadelphia Inquir
er, spoke about his role in uncovering the 
story about outright lying by the Nu
clear Regulatory Commission regarding the 
nuclear accident.
Although TARTAN staffers were con
sidered cocky, wild and conceited at the
convention, they were given the grand 
treatment by convention organizers. The 
TARTAN placed a bid to host the next 
years convention, and won by a large mar
gin. Conventioneers from other schools 
were interested in coming to CMU and 
Pittsburgh, and seemed impressed with the 
TARTANs achievements and staff cohe
siveness. The TARTAN delegates returned 
with smiles on their faces. Our staff won 
so many plaques, that we couldnt fit them 
in our suitcases, one TARTAN staffer 
said. Thats why Im glad the convention 
will be at CMU next year. We wont have 
to lug all these awards clear across the 
state!
Dickey Speaks 
To AIESEC
On April 5, the members of AIESEC 
and several AMS students attended a 
lecture given by Robert Dickey III, Presi
dent of Dravo Corp. at the Dravo head
quarters in downtown Pittsburgh. Dickey 
gave a broad overview of the history and 
fundamentals of international trade and 
then spoke on the effects of politics and 
governmental intervention on trade abroad.
He indicated some of the cultural differ
ences that are often encountered in busi
ness and indicated methods of adjustment 
that are currently being used. Finally, he 
informed the students of Dravos increasing 
relations with the Peoples Republic of 
China.
The SDC Space
by Mindie Jo Snyder
Proposals were raised, issues were dis
cussed and new appointments were made 
at the SDC meeting Sunday March 11\- A 
good portion of the meeting concerned the 
St. Patricks Day party in Donner Hall Satv urday, March 17, given in conjunction with 
Residence Life. In the future the two or
ganizations plan to work closely together 
for social events.
Its Springtime and anyone interested in 
obtaining SDC intramural equipment in
cluding a recently purchased volleyball can 
contact Steve Fulton, new Intramural 
chairman, at 216 Scobell, x-4184.
Housing committee reported that be
cause of an extended housing deadline of 
March 5, thirty-six more people were able
to hand in their deposits. The deadline for 
Special Interest groups for housing was also 
extended. Finally, the proposed renovation 
and joining of Morewoods A and B towers 
will not take place this summer.
Renovations Committee reported that a 
3M copier will be installed in the Donner 
lobby.
The new ad-hoc committee on Alcohol 
Awareness will be chaired by Bill Reiner. 
Dean Swank intends to work with this 
group.
Additionally, President Jim Balsom 
appointed and council accepted Abby 
Selman and Carolyn Welty as representa
tives from Roselawn and Woodlawn respec
tively.
Seniors to be Surveyed
Seniors! When you open the Com
mencement packet you will notice an 
envelope marked senior questionnaire 
containing a survey requesting an eval
uation of your four year experience at 
Carnegie-Mellon. At many other compar
able institutions the Senior Question
naire is popular and is responded to en
thusiastically. Students recognize it as an
efficient tool for pinpointing problem 
areas and anonymously expressing con
cerns. At the same time the administra
tions of these universities study the
information received and consider the 
results when setting future policy and 
budgets.
Knowing of the success of this program 
at other universities, Carnegie-Mellon has 
decided to offer the Senior Question
naire to the class of 1979. Please fill in 
the form and return it to Skibo 56. For 
every completed survey turned in during 
the week of April 23rd the participant 
will receive a gift voucher for a free ham- * 
burger and a Coke. At that time you may 
also wish to communicate any additional 
comments or suggestions on this project.

CMU profs study document design
by Linda Dickerson
The American Institutes for Research 
(AIR), anc* Seigel and Gale Inc. are current
ly participating in a three-year document 
design project.
Intended to develop methods of simp
lifying the language used in contracts, 
leases, loan agreements, regulations, and 
other public documents, this project is 
essentially a response to new state and 
federal laws which mandate that all 
regulations must be written in lucid English. 
President Carters executive order, decree
ing that documents of every federal agency 
must be able to be easily understood, is
just one example of such legislation.
Psychology professors, Lee Gregg and 
Dick Hayes; English professors, Erwin 
Steinberg and Richard Young; and GSIA 
professor, Linda Flower are all working on 
CMUs contribution to the project.^
By 1980, the university expects to offer 
the. nations first graduate program for 
Document Design Research on a doctoral 
level. Specific research into the processes 
of writing necessary to the program is the 
responsibility of Dick Hayes and Linda 
Flower.
AIR, located in Washington D.C., is
presently conducting workshops for 
government writers and organizing training 
courses in this field. Also, this organization 
plans a document design center, which will 
distribute texts, guidelines, manuals, job 
aids, and models discussing methods of 
simplifying documents and writing expli
citly.
Finally, CMU, the AIR, and Seigel and 
Gale, a New York private firm, will study 
the problems that deciphering documents 
presented to the poor, the elderly, and 
those individuals who have only a limited 
knowledge of the English language.
Summer work study jobs available
The Summer 1979 College Work-Study 
Program will begin on Monday July 2, 
1979 and end on Sunday September 2, 
1979. According to Libby Fonseca, Assis
tant Financial Aid Director, the reason for 
such a late start in the summer program 
is because CMU will have used its al
lotted 197879 fiscal year work-study 
funds by May. It is projected that CMU 
and not the federal government pay the 
final $60,000 needed to complete workstudy for the spring semester.
This provision means that the student 
will not be responsible to apply a large 
amount of this money toward college as 
would be expected if the student were 
being paid by work-study funds. However, 
beginning July 2, the students payroll 
funds will be supplied by the College 
Work-Study Program.
Fonseca also stated that departments 
will need students to begin work in May.
Students who are hired prior to July 2 
will be paid out of the respective depart
ments budgets. The money earned prior 
to July 2 will not be considered workstudy earnings. '
Ms. Fonseca was pleased to say that 
CMU has been awarded a 67% increase in 
federal work-study funds for fiscal year 
7980-$ 1.1 million as compared to 
$592,000 for 7879. She praised Finan
cial Aid Director Walter Cathie for all 
the work that he has done to bring large 
sums of aid to Camegie-Mellon. Because 
of the increase in work-study funds, 
Fonseca sees no further problems in sum
mer work-study monies after this year.
The Financial Aid office is concerned 
over the small number of applications 
received to date and wants to emphasize 
that on-campus jobs will be available in 
May, with many more being added on 
July 2.

and applications as soon as possible.
HEW cracks down
In preparation for congressional debates 
over federal funding of student financial 
aid, the US Department of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare (HEW) has prepared a 
. breakdown of just who is defaulting on 
National Direct Student Loans (NDSL).
The answer is: virtually everyone. More 
than 3200 schools participate in the NDSL 
program, but only a third of them actually 
collected on more than 90 percent of the 
loans handed out. Nine schools failed to 
collect on even one out of every ten NDSL 
loans it made. In all, 853,000 students get 
direct aid, which amounts to $1.8 billion.
As of last summer, about $700 million 
of that total was in default.
Some schools, complained an aide to 
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano, arent 
even letting us know about the delinquent 
cases.  Califano has asked for more vigor
ous action. In the meantime, his NDSL 
budget jequest for next year is roughly a 
third less than current NDSL funding. He 
told a congressional committee that he 
wouldnt ask for more money for NDSL 
until colleges and universities do a better 
job in collecting.
Senate
Report
by Nina Houska
The Senate opened a new session with 
quite a few new faces. The new Senators 
meet the old and learned about senate pro
ceedings at a reception before the first 
meeting. This gathering later helped the 
new senators in the selection of Senate of
ficers.
Scott Miller was re-elected Chairman of 
Senate for a third term, and Carl Freedman 
was voted his Vice-Chairman in a very tight 
election. '
Committee chairpersons for the four 
standing committees were also chosen: 
Keith Cornell, Finance: Eric Anderson, 
Academic Affairs; Nina Houska, General 
Campus and Information; and Ralph 
Sherman, Rules.
The Senate approved two appointments 
by Scott Sibley, the new President of Stu
dent Government. These were Pat Crump, 
as Treasurer, and Fil Alieva, as Assistant to 
the President.
The General Campus and Information 
Committee reported that President Cyert is 
being asked to have more centrex phones 
installed in academic buildings. A survey is 
planned on the laundry facilities too.
Also, the committee is working on the 
lighting problem on campus. If any part 
of the campus is considered improperly lit 
by a student, please contact the committee 
or Mr. Dillon.
The Rules Committee recommended 
that the International Students Organi
zation be given supported recognition and 
the Society of Creative Anachronism be 
given non-supported recognition. The 
Senate approved both recommendations.
The Finance Committee presented a re
quest from the Tartan for $192 so that 
four representatives from the staff could be 
sent to a newspaper convention in Phila
delphia. Those attending are award win
ners and next years Editor.
The Senate voted to postpone filling the 
empty CIT seat until their next meeting, 
because one of those petitioning for the 
position was not present. A motion to 
accept further petitions was rejected.Designers Note

"Stereotypes may affect ID of criminals
A CMU Ph.D. candidate, Sarah Goldin, 
believes that humans have stereotypes of 
different criminals that could affect 
identifying them.
Goldin has just completed a study 
that shows such stereotypes exist, and 
identifies some prototype criminals for 
armed robbery, embezzlement, book 
making, car theft, and political terrorism.
Because our world is so complex, we 
simplify it through generalizing and 
stereotyping, says Goldin.
Goldins research shows the unre
liability factor in eye witness accounts 
of crimes. In many instances, an eye 
witness may only see a criminals face for 
a split second. From this brief encounter, 
the police expect him or her to recon
struct the entire face, age, race, and build 
of the criminal. The witness may rely on 
his or her stereotypic impressions to fill 
in what he can not remember.
While the prototypes or models are 
probably not identical to any one persons
perceptions of the specific criminal, they 
do represent a combination of everyones 
stereotypic View, says Goldin.
I believe that most of these sterotypes 
are a product of mass media, particularly 
television, since very few of the subjects 
had experienced face-to-face contact with a 
criminal, such as actually seeing an armed 
robber or being raped. These televisionproduced stereotypes may bias peoples 
perceptions when they are trying to 
identify criminals, and have, in several
instances, led to a person being accused, 
tried, and convicted of a crime he or she 
did not commit.
Goldin believes that this information 
is particularly important to the police 
who question people and ask them to 
identify criminals. The police should 
recognize that people rely on these stereo
types to fill-in what they can not remem
ber, she begins. While they need all the
information a witness can supply, the police may resort to these stereotypes to
supply it.
TONITE! a special EASTER DINNER
Two CMU psychologists, Patricia Car
penter and Marcel Just, who have been 
studying comprehension processes in read
ing say good readers arent necessarily fast 
readers.
According to Carpenter and Just, a flex
ible approach to reading is more important 
than speed alone. Good readers adapt 
their reading speed and strategies to the 
type of text they are reading and their pur
pose for reading it.
The best readers have specific goals in 
mind. High speed skimming is appropriate 
for finding a specific piece of information 
. . . but a good reader will use a slower 
pace and selectively re-read sections to gain
an understanding of precise relationships . . 
. document, they say.
The psychologists believe there are two 
components to reading ability. The first is 
the process of word recognition and the 
decoding of written information. The 
understanding process is the second one.
The difficulties poor readersand listen
ershave is with understanding material: 
theyre unskilled at analyzing content.
When we read, meaning becomes estab
lished through successive sentences which 
build on each other, make reference to 
shared concepts, and are integrated in 
structure and content, Carpenter says.

Goldman: Cell Motility Sanderson: Neural ResearchDr. Robert Goldman, a protessor ot 
biological sciences at CMU, has performed 
experiments that indicate that tumor 
formation is caused, in part, by a cells 
motility. The real irony of this discovery 
is that cell motility is crucial to the devvelopment of complex organisms, 
though later it can serve to destroy them, 
says Goldman.
During the embryotic stage of life, 
cell migration and division are necessary, 
natural processes. As the embryo com
pletes the gestation period, is bom, and 
matures, most cells lose their motility as 
part of a natural aging process. While 
various aspects of motility continue to 
play important roles in neuro-transmission,
April 11, 13, 16, 18 and 20 will be the 
dates for a SIMULA short course in the
Computation Center. All classes will be 
held in room 5302 Science Hall from

disgestion, and other metabolic processes 
in adults, most cells in the body stop 
dividing and moving by adulthood.
When cells in certain adult tissue re
initiate division and movement, tumors 
can develop, Goldman says. With 
benign growths, the cells only retain the 
ability to divide, such that one cell 
becomes two, then four, etcetera, until a 
noticeable lump develops.
In malignant growths, the cells regain 
full motility. That is, not only do they 
divide, but they also br*ak lose and 
migrate throughout the body. At some 
point, they lodge and create new mal
ignant tumors.

A CMU biomedical engineer, Dr. Arthur 
Sanderson, has partially broken the coding 
of impulse patterns that transfers informa
tion from the eyes to the brain.
Working with cats and frogs, Dr. Arthur 
Sanderson has discovered a quantitative 
method of decoding the signals that 
neurons send to the brain when presented 
with simple stimuli, such as spots of light, 
simple images and colors. The neurons send 
different signals for each stimulus present
ed. Its very similar to a type of Morse 
code, Sanderson says.
While other researchers have worked in 
the general area of neural processing in the 
eye Sanderson is one of the first to quanti
fy the time-varying response patterns large
ly because of the engineering and computer 
techniques used to design the experiments 
and understand the results.
By using a computer to detect and sep
arate individual signals, Sanderson can also 
record the signals produced by as many as 
three neurons at one time.
Of all the physiological systems, the 
nervous system is the least understood, 
Sanderson continues. It was always as
sumed that the eye responded much like a 
television set, picking up everything in the 
visual field.
Research has shown that this is not 
true. The eye notices the perimeter of an
object much sooner than its center, and 
will notice changes in the general field 
much quicker than if the field remains un
changed. The information seems to be en
coded in such a way that it optimizesit 
includes and responds to the most impor
tant features of that particular stimulus.
Sandersons research could lead to many 
medical and technological breakthroughs. 
It could help medical scientists understand 
and possibly cure a variety of neurological 
disorders including some types of blind
ness. Other important applications in
clude the development of artificial eyes or 
ears that are capable of seeing or hearing 
by using mini-computers that are pro
grammed with this code.

Toxicology Option Added
Toxicology is a composite of biology, 
chemistry, and statistics. The current de
mand for toxicologists has spurred a strong 
job market for skilled technicians at the 
bachelors level, as well as for master and 
doctorate level toxicologists.
The CMU student doing a BS degree in 
biological sciences or chemistry acquires 
the basic science knowledge which must be 
the foundation for the building of a toxi
cologist. To augment that education and to 
facilitate a students taking advantage of 
opportunities particular to toxicology, MIS 
has developed a toxicology option.
The toxicology option is designed for a 
student doing a BS degree in biological 
sciences or chemistry. It is built around a 
new senior level specialty course in toxi
cology, but includes other courses. A stu
dent takes the required courses listed in the 
CMU catalog for the BS degree and, in ad
dition, takes the courses designated on the 
following outline. A student receives a deg
ree which reads BS in Biological Sciences 
(Biochemistry/Biophysics) or BS in Bio
logical Sciences (Molecular/Cellular Bio
logy) or BS in Chemistry. The student also 
receives a certificate stating that he or she 
completed the toxicology option.
For the BS in Biological Sciences, the 
following courses will be required for the 
option in toxicology.

The Division of Student Affairs is 
pleased to announce that Yvonne McCredie, Off-Campus Housing Advisor, has 
agreed to serve as Ombudsman for Stu
dents. Her Office is located in Skibo, 
Room 56. She is available during the 
hours of 9 AM and 4 PM on weekdays.
The idea of an Ombudsman originated 
in the Scandinavian countries to insure that 
citizens were not frustrated by the bu
reaucracy which developed in those coun
tries. The idea of creating such an office 
has been discussed several times at Carnegie-Mellon University. While we believe 
that members of the faculty and adminis
trators intend to be responsive to student 
problems, it is often difficult for a stu
dent to approach a member of the fac
ulty or an administrator.
Mrs. McCredie has developed broad 
familiarity with the University, its admin
istrative, and its academic systems and will 
serve as a resource for students who 
either are unsure of the resources available 
to them or who are having difficulty in 
utilizing the services provided by the 
University.
Mrs. McCredies service as Ombudsman 
should provide an additional resource to 
students.Call an Escort

The Harrisburg Syndrome
by Frederic J. Siegel
In reacting to the tragedy which occured 
last week at the Harrisburg Nuclear Plant, 
one feels compelled with fear, anxiety and 
even anger. Initially, the American public 
responded with disbelief. While we have 
certainly been aware of the potential ha
zards of nuclear energy, in the midst of our
oil habit, we have fallen to the depths of 
false security. Last week, as the various re
ports unfolded from Harrisburg, our false 
security vanished as we became thoroughly 
convinced of the potential disaster pending 
within the gas bubble.
Perhaps the accident at Harrisburg was a 
blessing in disguise. Perhaps G-dis warning 
us of a future apocalypse if we are not to 
reduce our investment in a nuclear age. 
Perhaps this accident will unite the Ameri
can public into a lobbying effort destined 
to eliminate a similar occurance. Whatever 
the political implications of this event, it 
remains a certainty that the United States 
government will not as easily be able to 
make such decisions without our input.
In Columbia Pictures ironically timely 
motion picture, The China Syndrome,
which so effectively deals with the risk of 
nuclear energy, the American public is 
portrayed as an naive and ignorant entity. 
That claim remains closer to the truth than 
one might imagine. Whether it is saccharin, 
hair dryers or nuclear energy, it is a sad 
truism that we are not nearly informed 
enough in regard to our environment and 
those tools which have made it livable. 
Can we trust the assurances of a govern
ment that so recklessly led us into 
Viet Nam and a business community that 
places the value of the almighty dollar over 
human life?
Rather than be a duped participant in a 
plan of destruction we must investigate, 
fight and ultimately defeat those persons 
whom are gambling with our future. Is it 
nuclear energy now and the risk of world 
destruction later? Are we to fall victim to 
a sword dipped in gasoline at the expense 
of those principles upon which we were 
founded? The final question, only to be an
swered by ourselves., is simple: Do we ex
ploit today at the risk of tomorrow or do

Accident triggers angry response
by Jill Smudski
The nuclear accident at Three Mile Is
land has focused public outrage on an issue 
that many smaller groups are already aware 
of, that is, the safety of nuclear energy. 
And to show public support and concern 
for the people of Harrisburg, several public 
rallies are being planned.
Two of these, sponsored primarily by 
the Pennsylvania Alliance for Jobs and En
ergy (PAGE), are aimed specifically at the 
Duquesne Light Company. These are part 
of an ongoing effort by PAJE to force the 
utility to lower its rates overall, and to 
show more concern for the rights of elec
tricity consumers. The first of these rallies 
will be held Friday, April 6, at 12:00 noon, 
in front of the Duquesne Light offices on 
Sixth Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh. At 
this time, the group will demand a meeting 
with John Arthur, the president of Du
quesne Light, and will present to him a list 
of issues and demands. These include: (a) 
stop appealing the court order which has 
temporarily closed the Beaver Valley No. 
1 nuclear plant, and, in fact, (b) close the 
Beaver Valley plant permanently, (c) pro
tect the worJcers now employed at the 
Beaver Valley plant by transferring them to 
other divisions, at the same or better pay 
scale and level of seniority, (d) stop the 
unnecessary construction of the seven nu
clear plants by the CAPCO group, and fi
nally, (e) dont pass on the costs of bad in
vestments in nuclear energy to the consum
er.
The second PAJE-sponsored rally will be 
held Tuesday, April 17, at 10:30 AM, in 
the Mmiongahela Room of the William 
P^nn Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. This 
rally is a counteraction to a scheduled
meeting of Duquesne Light stockholders, 
and will focus basically on the issue of mis
management of public funds on the part of 
Duquesne Light. For more information 
concerning these two rallies, please contact 
the PAJE office at 566-2290.
Many other groups, in addition lo 
PAJE, are supporting these actions. Some 
of these groups are the Mobilization for 
Survival, the Young Socialists Alliance 
(YSA), the International Socialists (IS), the 
Thomas Merton Center, Three Rivers 
Clams, the Christian Peacemakers, the 
Peoples Power Project, and the Friends of 
the Earth. Members of these groups, and all 
other concerned groups and individuals, are 
encouraged to attend these rallies. ,
In conjunction with these actions, a co
alition composed of members of these 
groups and concerned individuals, has been 
formed to sponsor a third rally. The focus 
of this rally'is simply No More Nuclear 
Power!. It is a direct response to, and a 
protest of, the whole Three Mile Island sit
uation, and it will show our solidarity with 
our counterparts in Harrisburg and else
where. This rally will be held Saturday, 
April 14, at 12:00 noon. It will begin at 
the Duquesne Light offices on Sixth Ave
nue, and will proceed from there to the 
Westinghouse offices on Stanwix Street. At 
the end of the march, various speakers, in
cluding experts on nuclear power, will ad
dress specific issues and demands. Anyone 
concerned with the future of nuclear pow
er is welcome to attend: a large turnout 
would state emphatically that we in Pitts
burgh are united in our demand for No 
More Nuclear Power!. For more informa
tion about this rally, please call the Mobil
ization for Survival office at 381-1400.
Classes suspended near Harrisburg
CARLISLE, PA (CPS ) The news, accord
ing to one administrator, arrived some 24 
hours after the initial, disabling incident 
at the Three Mile Island nuclear power 
plant near Harrisburg on March 28.
Thus began a four-day effort by admin
istrators at Dickinson College, a small liber
al arts chool athat sits some 26 miles away 
from the power plant, to keep its students 
calm and its campus open. After repeated 
radiation readings by nuclear physicists on 
the faculty, regular reminders to the stu
dents, several all-college meetings, and con
stant reassurances all around, the adminis
trators eventually lost their battle.
John Ross. Dickinsons public informa
tion director, announced on Sunday, April 
1, that classes would, after all, be suspend
ed through April 9. The suspension came 
despite readings that indicated that, ac
cording to Ross, there is no danger to 
students on the campus. Evacuation plans 
extended in a 10-mile radius from the 
power plant. Carlisleand Dickinsonare 
26 miles away.
Nevertheless, studentand later, parent
alanxieties were difficult to restrain. On 
Friday, March 30, Sarah Snvder of The 
Dickinsonian, the school paper, reported
that pirents are driving up here and tak
ing heir kids away. A lot ot people are on
In toads hitchhiking out of here.Koss suggested only that "a lot more
people left for home for the weekend than 
would normally do so. By Sunday, the 
school administration received many, 
many calls from students and parents 
wanting to know if they should return to 
campus for classes.
After two all-college meetings Friday 
and Saturday night, the administration 
gave students the option of leaving campus, 
assuring them that they wouldnt be penal
ized if they fled until the crisis in Harris
burg was over. But a lot of students, 
Ross reflected, felt that the statement was 
somehow pressuring them to stay. On 
Sunday, President Sam. A. Baker released 
a new statement, suspending classes with
out officially closing the campus for those 
who wished to stay.
We suspended classes because we 
didnt want the students to feel pressured 
into staying. And, it wouldn't be feasible 
to carry on normal classes anyway. I think 
itd be hard to sit through a lecture on 
Caesars march through Gaul, when all you 
really want to do is talk about Three Mile 
Island.

Hop-a-thon raises money
The Easter Bunny is coming! Sure, 
youve heard that one since you'were a kid, 
right? Well, on Saturday, April 14, it will 
all come true, as the six foot tall Bunny, 
pushes an Easter basket, filled, of course, 
with a five foot tall chick.
The event is a Hop-a-thon, a ten-mile 
trek through the streets of Pittsburgh to 
raise money for CARE. Sponsored jointly 
by Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Upsilon, the Hop-a-thon is a test of endurance: 
can the Bunny (a DU brother) push the 
basket with the chick (a KKG sister) all the 
way downtown.
We hope to raise at least Si,000 for 
CARE, says Greg Jordan, DUs Chapter 
Relations Secretary and the man respon
sible for the whole project. This is some
thing never seen before in Pittsburgh, and 
were sure the people of this city will sup
port our effort. Money will be raised
through pledges on a per-mile basis and 
through collections on the day of the 
event.
CARE, the beneficiary of this unusual 
fundraiser, is a non-profit organization 
dedicated to serving the worlds less fortu
nate through programs of self-help as well 
as outright gifts of aid. Since 1945, CARE 
has fed, clothed and provided medical care 
for millions of impoverished people. In 
addition, 1979 has been designated as 
CAREs International Year of the Child.
The Hop-a-thon will commence at 
10:00 AM on campus at the comer of 
Forbes Ave. and Morewood Ave. It will 
weave through Oakland and other parts of 
the city before finally reaching downtown 
Pittsburgh along Liberty Ave.
If you wish to make a pledge or desire 
more information, the numbers to call are: 
Kappa Kappa Gamma, 578-3097, or Delta 
Upsilon 682-8542.

Steel Menagerie lives on cut
by Susan Borg
Most CMU students are probably familiar 
with the Irish Setter that runs around 
campus. The owner; Stuart Suna, an architiect and sculptor, decided that the dog 
needed some friends on the cut; so he 
decided to create his Steel Menagerie.
The Steel Menagerie is on the cut op
posite Doherty Hall. The animals are made 
from pieces of the old Center Ave. Bridge. 
This is - recycled sculpture because the 
materials are all scrap.
The Steel Menagerie is the product of 
3'A years of planning and about 13 hours 
of labor to assemble it this past Thursday 
night. But Suna doesnt feel that theamount of labor he put in is important, 
because people may start getting down on 
(him) because (he) didnt put in enough 
time.
Suna has been getting really good re
sponses about the Menagerie, but some 
fraternities had knocked them over during 
the night. At least they are responding to 
the work, not ignoring it, he said.
Suna was assisted by architect students: 
Fred Smith, Jim Halpern, and Craig 
McCloud. The artists plan to leave the 
sculpture where it is for an indefinate per
iod of time. I havent gotten any com
plaints, so why move it? says the artist.

H&SS has Spring Fling
H&SSs newly formed Student Advisory 
Council (SAC), has been making a lot of 
progress in uniting the students of H&SS 
and initiating spirit and pride within the 
college. This has been done through various 
social functions throughout the year, estab
lishing and redecorating the H&SS Lounge, 
and beginning work on several academic 
problems.
The SAC is designed to respond to the 
needs of the students. In keeping with this 
philosophy the H&SS SAC is pleased to 
present the First Annual Spring Fling. The 
Spring Fling is the answer to a letter re
ceived by the H&SS Newsletter. The letter 
suggested that H&SS have a big party along
the lines of Fine Arts Beaux Arts Ball. Al
though the Spring Fling is not designed to 
compete with the Beaux Arts Ball, it was 
widely agreed upon that a Spring Fling was 
a good idea.
The First Annual Spring Fling will be 
held on Sunday evening, April 22nd, on 
the Gateway Clipper. There are a limited 
number of tickets still available. These are 
on sale in BH 161 between 9 AM and 5 
PM. After these hours call x4785. For 
more information call x4736. Spring Fling 
has now been opened to the campus com
munity. Finish Spring Carnival off with a 
bang; dance and dine at the H&SS Spring 
Fling.
This summer Parsons offers you the opportunity 
to paint on the Rive Gauche, explore the

A ll-A mer ican Woman finalist talks about contest
by Susan Borg
While I was waiting to interview Lyn 
Vaux, one of the finalists in the All Ameri
can Woman Contest, I was trying to put to
gether a list of questions that would suc
ceed in drawing information from someone 
who was probably a typical dumb broad. 
After all, I thought to myself, who else 
would enter a beauty contest? Almost im
mediately, I realized I was wrong.
Lyn, an 18 year old freshman in CMUs 
Musical Theater option, was bubbly, out
going, and very vocal about her recent ex
perience competing for the title of All 
American Woman. It was clear from the 
start that Lyn Vaux didnt need to be 
prodded to talk.
Why dont I just tell you about the 
whole thing, she began. You can ask 
me questions as I go along.
Lyn was the youngest of 45 girls to be 
flown to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Li
mousines met them at the airport and car
ried them to the hotel where the red carpet 
service continued for the entire week. In
stead of making this a competition I want
ed to enjoy myself, she said. Some of 
the girls were really upset that they didnt 
win, but it was an all around good experi
ence.
Lyn entered the contest because it is 
good exposure for an aspiring actress. I 
knew from the very beginning, though, 
that I wasnt the All American Woman. I 
like to stand out in a crowdyouve got to 
if you want to be an actress. The All Am
erican Woman is supposed to be typical.
There were snotty girls, tacky girls, 
rich girls, poor girls, models, and a lot of 
really good people. I maybe fit in some
where, but the girl who won was probably 
the most average.
I mentioned to Lyn the image I had in 
my mind about girls who entered beauty 
contests. You dont seem to be the type 
of girl that would enter this kind of a con
test. I understand that the exposure and 
experience are invaluable to an actress but, 
what made you enter this particular con
test?
They said that they didnt want it to 
be a beauty contest where you were judged 
by how you look in bathing suits. So they 
put you in a leotard which is really the 
,same thing.
They didnt gear you towards the 1979 
woman, Lyn said. The questions were 
intellectually degrading, and the sports 
competition was in typically womens 
sports, she added. A lot of changes have
StudentsAre you looking for Work?
The CMU Physical Plant Department has a number of positions as General 
Laborers available.
Some of those hired could start at once on a part time schedule until the end of 
the sehool year. Once school is over the work schedule would be 7:30 AM to 
4:00 PM five days a week.
The duties include the performance of a wide variety of skilled and semi-skilled 
tasks in support of all of the various groups of workman in our shops i.e. A/C 
Mechanics, carpenters, electricians, groundsmen laborers, masons, automotive 
mechanic, painters, pipefitters, plumbers and welders.
The rate of pay for these positions would be up to $3.50 per hour depending 
upon your qualifications and experience.
If interested please call Mr. Charles B. McShane, Maintenance Superintendent 
at Ext. 2910 to arrange for an interview.

to be made for it to be a really good con
test, but this was the first year and Im sure 
there will be lots of changes.
Was there any kind of outlet to vent 
your opinions about the contest and the 
changes that you feel should be made? I 
asked.
No, but I wrote them a letter and told 
them anyway. I figure they can either take 
it or leave it, but at least I told them what 
I thought.
It seems like this was a really good 
thing for you to do. Do you have any re
grets?
No, it was good for me in a lot of 
ways. Ive never been west of Athens, Ohio 
before so this was a big thing for me. I got 
to meet a lot of really good people who
might be able to help me later on (the pro
ducer and the choreographer, for example), 
and I learned a lot about the techincal as
pects of television. I hate television, and 
I hope I never have to perform regularly on 
it, but it certainly cant hurt to have this 
experience. Lyn said.
Lyn said that she enjoyed the Tony 
award thing (a short act that she created 
to describe the woman she owfcl like to be 
ten years from now) the most because she 
got to say hi to Carnegie-Mellon.
After Lyn had left I felt like I had 
known her for a long time. I dont know if 
Lyn is typical of the girls who enter these 
kinds of contests but Ill think twice before 
I assume that someone is a typical dumb 
broad type.

1985 grads face tough job market
ATLANTA, GA (CPS)Southern liberal 
arts major, diversity. Youve nothing to 
gain but some jobs.
Thats the essence of a new report 
by the Southern Regional Education Board 
called Supply and Demand for College 
Graduates in the South, 1985. The reports 
most startling conclusion is that only 80 
percent of the Souths college graduates in 
1985 will find jobs that are usually filled 
by college graduates.
Comparing the supply of graduates with
job opening, the board found the gloo
miest outlooks for the liberal arts, educa
tion, communications, law, and social work 
majors of 1985
Report authors Marily J. McCarty and 
Eva C. Galambos think many of those 
majors will end up seeking jobs as sales, 
clerical or blue-collar workers, and as 
service or farm workers.
They add business administration, 
health, and computer sciences graduates, 
though, should have good job prospects.
For example, the authors forecast that m 
business administration the average 
annual job openings will be almost double 
the supply of graduates. Theyre hoping 
that many liberal arts majors will thus get 
to fill those jobs, and recommend that they 
include practical courses like accounting, 
computer programming, or personnel 
management in their curricula in order to 
be prepared.
Pharmacy grads are about the only en
dangered species among students in healthrelated fields. Accounting and engineering 
graduates are expected to continue to be 
in demand, but the glut of lawyers is also 
expected to continue.
The report covers only the south, which 
the board defines as Alabama, Arkansas, 
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maryland, Mississippi, North and South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and 
West Virginia.
Superwalk held 
for March of Dimes
Prospective Superwalkers take note:

the largest single-day fund-raising event in 
Pennsylvania.
Last year, participants in the walk raised 
over $500,000 to aid the March of Dimes 
fight against birth defects, making it the 
most successful walk in the events history. 
This year, the Chapter hopes that partici
pating Superwalkers will be able to even 
better last years record-breaking figure.
The money raised from March of Dimes 
walkathons is used locally to support 
March of Dimes research and medical ser
vice programs, such as the University Gene
tic Counseling Service at Childrens and 
Magee-Womens Hospitals; to award re
search grants for the study of birth defects 
and their prevention and/or cure; to pro

A Message from ECKANKAR
ECKANKAR
A Way of Life
ECKANKAR is a way of life. It is the most 
ancient religion known to man, and through it 
the universal questions are seen in their deepest 
meaning and answered by the direct experience 
of God. The student of ECK (Spirit) lives a 
responsible, involved existence, paying his own 
way, serving a useful function in society, and 
fulfilling his commitments to himself, his family 
and his employer.
In this way ECKists are busy translating 
their inner unfoldment into everyday life terms 
all around the world. Yet the most dis
tinguishing facet of the ECKist's existence is a 
sense of joy, a joy which arises from his 
knowledge that death is a myth, that the word 
life has a reality that encompasses states of con
sciousness beyond mans imagination, and that 
the only thing that holds man from the realiza
tion of these states is his own self-limiting con
cepts.
Freedom of Choice
The ECK teachings hav always been 
available throughout the course of history, but 
they have never denied the validity of any other 
religious path or teaching. This teaching is not 
Eastern in originrather, it encompasses all of 
mans religions. ECKANKAR does not con
demn any path nor the follower of any religious 
teaching, and does not accept the negative at
tacks that so-called religious leaders have 
directed at it. The great leaders of the past such 
as Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed, each played 
a great role but, unfortunately, their followers 
have often caused religious wars, persecution 
and general hatred. This is a misconception 
which has no place in any.truly spiritual path. It 
is a violation of the Law of Spirit to attempt to 
influence another person for any reason what
soever without that person's permission. The 
teachings of ECK state that each individual 
must be free to make his or her own decisions 
every step of the way. Those who violate this 
law will reap the consequences of their actions, 
which will come about through the natural 
vehicle of Spirit, not the agency of any man or 
group.
ECKANKAR is based upon individual 
freedom of choice; converts are never 
sought after, nor is tithing. Neither do com
munal living, drug use nor religious ashrarns 
reflect the nature of individuality and personal 
freedom found in the ECK teachings down 
through the ages. The teachings are simply 
made available to the many who today are seek
ing personal spiritual growth and unfoldment 
to Self-realization and God-realization.
Next open discussion: Monday, April 16, in Skibo 
Book available in CMU Bookstore.
How ECK Can Help You
The ECKist learns to contact this audible 
life stream and to trace it back to the Source 
from which it came in the heavenly worlds. This 
spiritual liberation gives man freedom from all 
things. Former negative traits drop away 
naturally, such as smoking, temper, undue at
tachment to material things, gluttony and ab
normal talking. These things are not bad or evil 
in themselves, but that which will fasten the at
tention solely upon the limited physical state. 
These are replaced with the highest qualities 
and ethics known to man. Through the spiritual 
exercises of ECK and the guidance of 
Sri Darwin Gross, the 972nd Living ECK Master, 
one can have the conscious experience of the 
heavenly worlds and know what lies beyond 
death.
ECKANKAR serves as a vehicle for the 
individual to lift himself out of the realm of the 
psychic. It allows one to live life fuller each 
day, to be more confident with a greater under
standing and love for all life. The whole pur
pose of ECK is to provide spiritual succor and 
upliftment to all who seek it. It is freedom from 
old limitations and habits, a way to experience 
life fully, consciously and to find the answers to 
the questions that have always plagued 
mankind. Those individuals who follow this 
direct path to God will find it an adventure in 
personal freedom and spiritual experience.

Law school applications downl
NEW Y0RK,NY (CPS)Fewer people are 
applying to law schools these days, while 
more graduates who normally would have 
gone to law school are opting for business
school.
Thats the finding of a survey by the 
Arational Law Journal, which polled 40 law 
schools, and found that there are 14 per
cent fewer applications to next falls class.
Admissions officers told the publication 
that the decline in applicants can probably 
be traced to national publicity about the 
shortage of lawyer jobs, to rising tuition, 
to the Bflkke decision, and to the popular 
perception that a masters of business ad
ministration (MBA) is a more marketable 
degree.
Tulane Law School Admissions Direc
tor Rose LeBreton, for example, explained 
that the MBA appears to students to be a 
certificate needed to get into business at' 
|? an entry level. Consequently, the number 
of people taking the Graduate Management 
Admissions Test has increased by 18 perCarnival 79cent since 1976, while there are five per-^.

Philosoph y ma jors a re 
Best trained for grad school
Question: Majors in which subject
have the highest rate of acceptance into 
medical schools? The New York Times 
reported in a 1977 article that the answer 
is: Philosophy. So too, admissions officers 
at law, business and other professional 
and graduate schools have long recog
nized the value of training in philosophy. 
A B.A. in Philosophy has for some time 
been one of the best routes into post
graduate education.
The latest news is that the word has 
begun to spread beyond the confines of 
the universities. The Los Angeles Times 
reports in an April 3, 1979 article that 
Modern social institutions, for their 
part, are appealing to philosophers more 
and more for help with moral problems 
created by modern technology and its 
roles in an ever changing world.
The Times quotes Dr. Joseph D. Duffey, 
chairman of the National Endowment for 
the Humanities, as saying, Weveseen
enough change in philosophys relation to 
society and vice-versa to know this is more 
than a few straws.' Clearly this is a new 
phenomenon and its not exaggerating to 
say it is a dramatic change from the past. 
I think it has made philosophy an exciting 
and vital field again.
The Times details how philosophers 
are being employed in consulting jobs 
outside the university. These jobs range 
from examining a corporations statements 
in a public controversy to sitting on a 
congressional technology panel studying 
the competitiveness of the UJS. steel 
industry.
A philosopher is employed by a 
Hershey, PA., hospital to assist patients 
as well as the staff in considering such mat
ters as surgery, recuperation and costs.
As the Times sees it: It all adds up to a 
new situation in which the philosopher 
sees an expanded role for himself in soci
ety, and society sees the philosopher as 
an interesting and useful person.

Surprisingdating factors
Surprisingly, the most important factor 
students considered in finding a suitable 
date through a computer matching prog
ram at the University of California-Davis 
was whether or not their prospective date 
smoked. For women, the second most im
portant factor was to find someone who 
would respect their wish to becoming physically involved only with someone with 
whom they have a close, long-term 
relationship. For men, the attractiveness 
of the prospective date ranked second. 
Among interests, both men and women 
students rated rock music first, followed 
by dancing, dining out, movies 
people-watching, and playing tennis.
Did you know we can find a breast cancer as fsmaW as the head of a pin?

Such a tiny cancer can 
almost always be cured. 
Mammography, a technique 
of low-dose breast x-ray, can 
detect a cancer long before a 
lump can be felt. While it is 
still highly curable.

Tips for hikers in Central Pennsylvania
For hikers seeking lightly traveled paths 
through unspoiled wilderness, central Penn
sylvania offers some of the best hiking in 
the Northeast. Throughout the ridge and 
valley regions of the state and across the 
Allegheny plateau exists a network of trails 
whose length exceeds that of the Appala
chian and Pacific crest trails combined.
Now, just published, is a guidebook to 
these trails by a Penn State University 
professor, Thomas Thwaites. Fifty Hikes in 
Central Pennsylvania is the first guide de
voted exclusively to the trails of Pennsyl
vanias heartland. It is the seventh in a 
series of hiking guides for the Northeastern 
states produced by the New Hampshire 
Publishing Co.
The author selected his 50 hikes for 
their "wide range of hiking experiences and 
to introduce hikers to Pennsylvanias wild 
and natural areas as well as its organized 
trails." Ranging in length from one to 75
miles, Thwaitess guide includes 15 intro
ductory walks, 30 day hikes, and five 
backpacking trips.
Summary headings for each trip list total 
mileage, walking time and vertical rise 
figures. Distances are indicated in both 
traditional and metric systems. The trail 
descriptions are excellent, supplying the 
hiker with distinct landmarks, words of 
caution and even some shortcuts and alter
natives to the basic routes.
Sketch maps, as well as the authors 
impressive photographs, accompany each 
hike, providing the reader with a glimpse of 
the wilderness that lies between Pennsyl
vanias industrial centers.
Brief historical notes help to enhance 
the hikers sense of continuity with the 
land and its past. Forbes Trail, in Shawnee 
State Park, is a Temnant of the wagon 
road cut in 1758 by General John Forbes 
to take Fort Duqesne in the French and
Indian War. Other notes recall early 
logging days, and the beginnings of this 
countrys railroads.
The hiker is encouraged throughout the 
book to appreciate the unusual and lesser 
known features of the natural areas sur
rounding the trails, from a stand of 500 
year old Hemlocks to a rare clump of 
young American Chestnuts. Thwaitess 
valuable ecological notes serve as a remin
der of the unique qualities of every 
meadow and stretch of virgin timber.
Author Tom Thwaites, an active, and 
enthusiastic hiker, has walked all the trails 
in this guide, and has scouted, cleared, 
blazed and maintained many of them. He 
is an active member of the Penn State 
Outing Club, Keystone Trails Association, 
Appalachian Trail Conference, Sierra Club, 
and the newly formed American Hiking 
Society. Tom Thwaitess other outdoor
activities include canoeing, cross-country 
skiing and photography.
Central Pennsylvania is remote, wild 
beautiful, and undiscovered. Now Tom 
Thwaites has given hikers a book that will 
permit them to find their way on foot 
through the spendors of Penns Woods, 
is how Maurice J. Forrester, Jr. President, 
Keystone Trails Association, has praised 
Thwaitess book.

THE MEMS ROOM
a parody by Marvin Frencher with the assistance of Peyser
1
Milo was hiding in the men's room. He called it 
that even though somebody had scratched out the 
word men's in the sign on the door, and had writ
ten gentlemen underneath. He called it that out of 
twenty-eight years of habit, and until he saw the 
cross-out on the door, had never thought about it. 
"Gentlemen" was obviously a euphemism, Milo 
supposed, but for who's comfort, fearful women, 
or the men themselves? He had no strong objec
tion to euphemisms on general principle. Howev
er, he did detest what he called vulgarity, and had 
never in his life, even when handling one, uttered 
the word cunt. But here he was at the age of 
twenty-eight huddled for safety in a cubicle in the 
psychology department's men's room on the third 
floor of Baker Hall, gazing at, not studying that 
word and others of the same genre, etched with 
macho determination into the gray paint on the 
cubicle door.
He was perched, fully clothed, on the edge of 
the toilet seat, feeling stupid and helpless, and 
constantly looking at his watch, for if he weren't in 
here during class changes, he'd have to be out 
there in the long corridors of Baker, passing the 
always-staring faces. Who was this old man? Just a 
rambling king of guy, thought Milo in his usual 
masochistic wit, fingering the gold lettering on his 
graduate social psych text, Grumphert's Socializa
tion of the American Male, copyright 1968, in 
which Milo was assured that the dreaded para
noia, contagious as the plague, had so thoroughly 
entrenched itself in the minds of most twentieth 
century men (or, anyway, in the mind of J.C. 
Grumphert), that it had reached pandemic pro
portions, and, in any case, there seemed very little 
hope.
He looked back to the walls.
"Fuck Ayn Rand. KILL ALL FASCIST 
PIGS!"
This had been answered. "Yourself included, of 
course."
A third party entered the argument here and 
had formed tense jagged letters with some hard, 
blunt instrument. The printing had scratched 
right through several eras of gray and red paint so 
that the underlying bedrock steel-zinc alloy 
shown through, periodically capturing the dim 
light and concentrating it so that the whole mes
sage seemed to gleam as if it were some sort of 
divine commandment or something. POST IS A 
CUNT, it read with scathing originality. He drew 
his breath in sharply and left the booth.
It was 1978.
2
For the hundredth time Milo thought: Who the 
hell is Post, anyway? Is he male? female? animal? 
vegetable? really a cunt? What would a six-foot 
cunt look like anyway?
Just a "genitals on legs? intoned Milo's highly 
associative English scholar's super-ego, in a stern 
but loving little mental hand-slap.
But the question soon became academic. That 
very evening, Milo had the pleasure of meeting a 
one-time associate of Mr. Post's at an off-campus 
get-together where he, Miio, had off-handedly 
mentioned the well known but nonetheless mys
terious epithet. It seems the poor jerk is in fact 
male and is currently doing graduate work in 
math at Stony Brook on Long Islandfar, far 
from Carnegie-Mellon and Milo.
But this Post being a guy opens up a whole new
chest of drawers. The author of the cruel missive
was obviously Post's lover, for who but a man's
lover could come to abhor him so thoroughly?
And if Post is a guy (and we know he is), this sug
gests that the author is most likely a woman. The
problem is, how did this woman get into all the
men's rooms to spread her gospel?
Of course, she didn't have to be a woman (she 
was certainly no lady). And if he wasn't, the sorry 
nature of the slur becomes explanable. We all 
understand that calling someone a "cunt" is an in
sult, but when the recipient is a male, it is an ex
treme insult for it is no longer merely dirty: It is 
now a slandering of Post's sexuality. But it's a 
very crude insult because what it is in fact is a slur 
on the female sex. And a male author would be in 
an easier position to hate women than a female.
On the other hand I somehow expect something a 
little less crude (like Post does it with small furry 
animals or something) from a gay, who, I assume, 
has necessarily meditated in depth on the ques
tion of one's sexuality; and we would expect him 
not to view sexuality so crudely, as a simple linear 
scale like a thermometer, with female at the bot
tom and male on top. .
So if the author were a woman after all, she 
has given us a very pretty piece of slander, for 
she's now got us seriously considering Post's very 
sexuality. But how'd she get into all the men's 
rooms?
While all these thoughts were drifting through 
Milo's half-numb alcohol-saturated brain, he was 
scanning the room, a small Squirrel Hill monoplex, trying to ignore the show music coming off 
the lo-fi, apparently to the delight of everyone 
else, when he noticed without much surprise that 
the party was mostly guys, which had a tendency 
to make the few women present the centers of all 
attention, their own as well.
Milo knew the sex ratio was due to the fact 
that this was a party made up almost exculsively 
of graduate students and a few young professors 
and post-docs. Proportionately, women in gradu
ate study, even English, could not hold a candle 
to women in the population at large.
Well, that's all right, Milo realized with sudden 
disgust, for he knew he could never seriously con
sider getting involved with a Happy Homemaker 
from out there, anyway. For that matter, he de
cided, even a casual relationship with one of those 
ordinary people would bore him to no end and 
possibly dry him up. Staying properly miserable is 
a fine art which Milo had cultivated through well > 
over a decade of cool paranoia, including one 
marriage to a Nordic goddess which had lasted for 
five of those years.
Then, in his stupor, it suddenly came to him
that maybe he could make it with one of those dirty-blonde, Born Survivors from Fernwood; afterall, how much trust could he have in someone
any more like himself? But then, what if he did
settle down with someone who only had a serious
thought once a year? He'd never know when it
was coming. She could catch him off guard. As
much as Milo wanted to, he could never trust
women.
He sunk down into one of those old bottomless 
fourth-hand dustbags Annette used to call Salva
tion Armchairs and stared across the room at 
what he believed were mostly empty people, nev
ermind that they were graduate students too. He 
was familiar with most of the English students' 
work and found it to be dry and lifeless. Many 
were married, some to each other, and Milo 
thought this might be a cause. How they ever 
gained admission to the department was a myste
ry to him.

---------------------------------------------------

His gaze was concentrated on the record-play
er, sitting on the floor against the opposite wall. 
Rex Harrison was croaking, "Why can't a woman
__________ l!Uo a man?"
3
Perhaps you find Milo a little ridiculous. I do 
myself. But I also have some sympathy for him, 
more than you, probably. You think he was vain 
and lifeless. I suppose these are words that could 
have been applied to him, but they are not the 
first ones that spring to my mind. I think his 
hiding in the toilet was ridiculous, but I like him 
better for that than for the meanness of sitting in 
a corner watching a party evolve about him, smug 
with his vodka and orange juice. But I also feel a 
little sorry for him, at least then. Not anymore.
Because in a way it doesn't matter how falsely 
we perceive the world, for our perceptions are 
very dear to us and there are few among us who 
would be willing to concede that their fantasies 
are not reality. I'll live my fantasy, you yours, 
and Milo his. But if I see All, why am I as mise
rable as Milo? Schopenhauer's right: Happiness 
is not a human possibility, since it means the 
absence of pain, which, as an aunt of mine used 
to say, only occurs when you're dead or dead 
drunk.
Is it naive to say that men are more likely to 
get stoned, given the opportunity, than women? 
Or maybe it's true. How to be sure? It would 
seem true if you consider how many girls you've 
taken out who don't drink and then stop to think 
how many guys you know who don't drink. . . 
There are certainly more male alcoholics, right? 
Or, maybe not. Maybe they just show up in the 
statistics and the institutions more because their 
failure to perform and produce is more visibly 
damaging.
Of course, when you consider how much more 
dues a .man's got to pay than a woman in this 
life, no wonder we find Milo in a drunken reverie 
on the catch-22's of doing battle with the status 
quo. Van would say it is we, the male sector, 
who allow ourselves to be put in a position where 
we always get the brunt of it with unwavering 
certainty.

Milo was an independent baby, fond of 
removing his clothes and dancing his way down 
the street of a summer's day to the local candy 
store. Ah, the little pleasures. The third time he 
was returned home clinging to by a policeman 
he d apparently taken a liking to. Mrs. Ward 
began to tie him up, but Milo continued to 
remove all his clothes. Mrs. Ward was the type
of woman who would have been at a cortiplete 
loss without her Dr. Spockand in fact she often 
was. But she concurred with the good doctor 
regarding the nastiness of corporal punishment 
and in this case used withdrawl of affection 
instead. It didn't work. Milo was still removing 
his clothes in public when a sophomore at NYU. 
Milo never learned to work within the system.
He was a bright child, but not very analytical. 
This seemed strange to his broker father who had 
read his Spock, too, and his Piaget as well. Milo 
was the pure expressionist and tended to fill the 
walls of his room and anyone else's with endless 
crayoned murals of naked soldiers and beautiful 
goddesses. His skill was undeniable. By high 
school, he was a master of sketching and careful 
shajding with the ball-point pen, that being the 
most readily available drawing implement. He'd 
copied every drawing of the old masters he could 
find, improving on many of them, by the time 
he'd reached the age of fifteen. When there were 
no more sketches to be copied, he moved on to 
tempera paint. His first painting was a selfportrait titled Male Nude. The technique could 
pass for professional; the abstract composition 
could qualify for genius.
It was all just a harmless thing he did, his 
parents believed, those adorable little sketches, 
remarkable as they so often were. But when Milo 
'surpassed the masters in the eighth grade, he 
began producing really original work which 
tended to be offtensive and frightening to his 
well-meaning but mild-mannered parents. They 
were ordinary people with a healthy sense of 
Godfear and your usual, ordinary neurosis. They 
were frightened people. They had worked "let 
it be" into a lifestyle. Milo's father would 
demand his mother's agreement: "Look at here! 
These are portraits of his friends at a party. . .in 
the nude\ Look! He couldn't merely draw them; 
he had to quarter them as well!"
Which wasn't true. In point of fact, they were 
all partially dissected in one way or another, as 
Milo had felt best befitted the personality of 
each. None of the figures was in the least bit 
clothed, though they seemed unaware of it. The 
athlete's leg muscles were laid bare. The crew-cut 
science freak's face was a skull; the nerves of the 
right hand of the left-handed violinist lay draped 
across the coffee table next to her, still connected 
up near the elbow; one couple among the group 
of friends had been known for their trend-setting 
sexual activities. . .It was an interesting composi
tion.
And Milo knew it. In fact, he was not unaware 
of a certain genius in his work. His parents' over
heard condemnation of his genius bothered him 
only a little. For Milo was one of that rare set 
who were both good and cognizant of the fact. 
His work was brilliant, he knew. So why couldn't 
they see it? The net result was that he started to 
grow apart from his parents at an earlier age than 
most of his peers. Like when he was ten.
5 v
When Milo turned eighteen, his father made it 
known that he'd be willing to finance Milo's 
education at New York University provided he 
majored in business. Milo agreed immediately 
because it meant at least four more years of 
support. Meanwhile, he would have his own place 
in the Village where he could begin his art-worldshaking career.
It didn't work out that way, however, because 
Milo couldn't suppress his disdain for all the 
Young Executives whose company he was forced 
to keep. He had trouble keeping his composure
in class; he would often start to crack up as he 
looked around the lecture hall. They're all 
bonzo\ he would think, and he'd begin to giggle. 
If he should happen to be called upon to speak 
when he was in such a state, it would push him 
over the edge and he could not suppress his 
laughter any more. And when Milo laughed, he 
roared. It was disturbing to his professors; they 
thought it was the pressure. His fellow students, 
however, felt his mockery. They tried to ostra
cize him but Milo would smile and walk away. 
Eventually, he stopped attending his business 
classes. He didn't even give his second-semester 
courses that much of a chance; he never went to 
a single session. At the end of his third semester 
he was kicked out of the business school.
During that year and a half he had extracted 
what little of value he could find in the art 
school. It was a good school; but Milo was 
better. The men who ran the school knew he'd 
someday be bigger than they'd ever be and tried 
to procure a scholarship for him. It would mean 
great prestige to the school if one of their grad
uates made it to the top. So why not start with 
someone of tip-toppy potential and make him a 
graduate? It might cost a bundle but consider 
how much better it would look than just giving 
him an honorary degree once he's already up 
there. But money for art scholarships was scarce, 
and without the active cooperation of the poten
tial recipient, the case was hopeless. ..
To keep his apartment, Milo started modeling. 
Even at two dollars an hour it was a status job 
and Milo wasn't above status-seeking. Besides his 
familiarity with art and composition, he had a 
great body and he knew he was good-looking by 
almost any standard, but mostly because he'd 
always been more relaxed that way. And his 
being-at-ease put the students at ease. Milo was 
a successful model.
And he probably could have gone far as a 
model alone had it not been for a curious turn of 
events. After accepting a few gigs with photo
graphy schools (which were then coming into 
their own), he received an unexpected offer from 
a well known fashion designer to model pieces of 
her spring line at an upcoming big-to-do show. 
This designer was, among other things, also into 
underwear and she was one of the first to intro
duce a line of sexy men's briefs and bathing suits. 
Things like red nylon bikinis and black fishnet 
T-shirts. She directed her own show and had all 
the male models display the underwear line by 
first coming out and modeling the main line and 
then proceeding to strip before the audience. The 
intent was straightforward; to show the sexual 
possibilities of men's underwear. It worked. And 
Milo was the star. He was mentioned in every 
fashion review,'very rare for an unknown.
Despite the show's great success, though, 
nothing happened. There were very few calls 
for modeling men's underwear. So that when 
Milo received a $250 a weeek offer from a gay 
night-spot he wanted to take it. He rationalized: 
he'd no doubt be setting a standard for all male 
striptese artists for many years to come. He 
sought the counsel fo friends, both male and 
female. Annette, a senior he'd met and impressed 
in his art classes, and whom he dated on and off 
since the fall, advised him to take the offer, that 
there was nothing wrong with flaunting it if 
you've got it, and what was he afraid of anyway?
When the offer was upped to $350, Milo 
found he'd forgotten what his reservations had 
been in the first place and took the job.
Milo, who was utterly straight sexually, and 
ordinarily feared no one, began to feel some

---------------------------------------------------

Page 20-TARTAN-April 10, 1979
consternation when the management insisted 
he wear whatever they demanded while he kept 
up an energetic RR step as the major portion of 
his twenty-minute act. At first he was rather 
amused by the opportunity. What worried him 
was their insistence that he wear his final G-string 
as tight as possible. He hoped his body would 
not betray him.
6
But, alas, he was only a man, and at 19, a very 
young one at that. On his first night at his new 
job, his disgrace was complete. But it didn't 
happen in quite the manner he'd feared it would. 
Milo was sure he could have made it if it hadn't 
been for Annette. The "Egress" was a nightclub/ 
discotheque/bar which was actually quite popular 
on both sides of the playground. That there was 
a decided bent towards the exploitation of male 
sexuality attracted not a few young women 
among the decidedly male patrons. So Annette 
was not feeling at all out of place as she sat in the 
back with the rest of Milo's friends watching Milo 
move into the free style part of his act.
Maybe she couldn't get enough of Milo at 
home, or maybe she was trying to start a new 
tradition, but more likely she was merely jealous 
of the attention her friend was receiving. Taking 
a five dollar bill from her purse and crumpling it 
into the palm of her hand, she got up from the 
table and stared at Milo till she had his attention. 
Then she began a slow, trance-like march towards 
him.
What the fuck's she up to? Milo wanted to 
know. He tried not to notice her. He had always 
been excited by the sight of her and this night 
was no exception. But Milo had told her quite 
specifically the nature of his reservations and he 
felt that she should know better. When she 
reached the rose lighted platform, Milo had 
turned away completely as a last defense. So that 
when Annette reached out to stuff the bill into 
Milo's black G-string, he was unprepared.
Milo felt her cool touch and it stopped him 
cold. As tvell as he knew Annette, he never 
dreamed she would go try something like this. 
Why now?
He was dumbfounded. He turned to look at 
her and his jaw dropped. Even in his disoriented 
state, he was able to take a moment to abstract 
the basic lines and curves that was Annette's 
incredible beauty. Quickly, he turned away; 
then he looked down.
Sticking out from his waistband he couia see 
the corner of a piece of paper. A note? He was 
aware that all talking had ceased and he supposed 
ali eyes were upon him. He reached down, and, 
with a glance in Annette's direction, slowly 
withdrew the bill. He knew then that his fears 
had not yet been realized and in his relief he 
doubled over in a great roar of a laugh, in which 
he was followed by all present except Annette 
who just smiled warmly, a smile that said, "See? 
There's nothing to worry about," whence she 
turned and made her way back to her table. Milo 
was left holding the bill. He looked around 
questioningly and tucked the bill back into his 
brief briefs to much hearty laughter from his 
audience.
If Annette had fully thought out the conse
quences of her act, she might not have been so 
sure of herself. She had failed to consider the 
possibility of anybody following her act. So that 
when she was comfortably seated once again and 
chanced to glance in Milo's direction, she was 
dismayed to notice that another woman was 
moving towards him, swaying slightly from what
ever she'd been drinking, and clutching a bill in 
a tight fist. This was not part of Annette's design 
but there was nothing she could do. In a panic 
she was about to enjoin her friends to stop the 
woman, but she saw that it was already too late.
Milo also saw the strange woman coming and 
caught himself wondering why he wasn't in the 
back of the room enjoying a beer with his friends. 
But for Annette's sake, he wasn't going to show 
any hesititation in fact, he really forced himself 
to get into it, making a great show of accepting 
what turned out to be just a buck.
Such a display of enthusiasm was perhaps a 
mistake. For it wasn't long before a big man at a 
table adjacent to Milo's platform, and wearing a 
black fishnet T-shirt that was several sizes too 
small for him, took a ragged ten-spot that had 
been lying on his table in a puddle of beer, and 
turned to face Milo, smiling as he rose from his 
seat.
Now Milo was fond of thinking of himself as 
very laid back and self-assured, but this was too 
much. Gay liberation was still on the bench 
waiting to see how the game would go for the 
women's libbers. Despite what he thought of as a 
very liberal attitude on the issue, deep down Milo 
feared homosexuals; but even more than that he 
feared the possibility of becoming one. All these 
buried fears'suddenly made themselves known to 
Milo when he perceived what was coming.
His first reaction was to back off, to turn and 
run, in fact.
Unfortunately, it was at that moment, sur
rounded by rose-tinted floods he remembered his 
Gypsy Lea mission. If he couldn't handle this 
situation he's be a failure; and he knew he'd 
never get another chance quite like this one. He 
also knew he'd be out $375 a week, and he wasn't 
going to let this fat slob take that from him. But 
too late he realized that the only alternative he 
had was to accept the bill for the man was upon
him. He was reaching up towards Milo's crotch, 
the sweating bill almost entirely swallowed up 
by this man's huge paw...
Milo's courage broke. He tried to back off.
The man grabbed his ankle.
Milo reflexively kicked his face in with his free 
foot. But the man, strong as a gorilla in heat, 
kept his hold on Milo's ankle.
The gorilla's two friends simultaneously came 
to his feet.
Annette screamed despite herself. She sprang 
up and started towards the platform from which 
Milo had just been pulled. Another one of Milo's 
friends, a guy, went after her. Several more came 
to their senses and started to move. The three 
men up front were big, but Milo's friends were a 
legion.
But before anything went down (so to speak), 
the mangement of the Egress, not unused to 
trouble of any variety, got into the act. The 
antagonists may have been big, but the Egress's 
two bouncers were bigger. They were all out on 
the street within two minutes, the three men, 
Milo, and his legion.
Actually, Milo was not booted, but he was 
quite shaken. It was agreed he'd take the rest of 
the night off. But he took all his stuff with him. 
He did not think he'd be back.
7
The experience had a profound effect on Milo. 
He went to his parents' home in Paramus and 
slept through the weekend. Somehow, a lot of 
what his parents had always preached seemed 
suddenly to make sense.
He tried to understand it. He tried to think it
through, but his noble self-assurance had been I 
crushed. Milo was confused. His mind had never I 
been well tuned to working through complicated, I 
abstract problems. He thought of his heroes. 
LeTrec, and Monet, Michelangelo of course, 
Durer, Parrish, Warhol. He had always held a 
strong identification with these men and others. 
But how he was forced to the conclusion that 
maybe he really wasn't like them at all, that he 
lacked the strength of character they all had had 
and which was a requisite to membership in their 
league. His spirit was fallen.
Milo was numb. He wasn't going back to 
modeling (which had never kept him too well fed 
anyhow), and he was slowly becoming convinced 
he would never be able to support himself as an 
artist. He was good at what he did, and he knew 
it; but one thing he'd learned over the last year 
was that he wasn't the only one around with 
talent. In fact, his was as yet a very small voice in 
a very large wilderness. And he was losing his 
way.
Mr. and Mrs. Ward were aware of none of this; 
they did not realize how deep Milo's depression 
was. He had never once in his life been this way 
before and his parents had no way of recognizing  
it for what it was. If they had suggested at that 
t-me that he return to business school and give up 
art forever, he would have consented.
But they weren't aware of that and even if they 
had been, they were not toally unsympathetic. In 
their own way they understood what Milo had 
been trying to do with his life and his art; and it 
didn't seem totally without value to them. To 
them, Milo was a compulsive expressionist and 
this frightened them because they were not 1 
compulsive anythings. But they did understand ^ 
him a little. And after all, how much room for 
self-expression was there in the business world?
When, to Milo's complete surprise, his parents 
proposed that he return to NYU as an art student, 
he tried to take it in stride, lest they see how 
confused he really was. He saw that all was not 
lost; there was hope yet.
But something had died within him. He knew 
this was true when four days later he opened 
the door to his Greenwich Village Apartment and 
wondered why he'd ever taken it in the first 
place.
And suddenly he knew what It was. He felt 
alone, cold and alone. This was something he had 
never felt before and it saddened him. He 
thought of Annette, and he realized that under 
her cool exterior, she was as alone as he was now; 
that in fact she had always been so. This was the 
part of her he had never understood. But he 
understood now, and he felt for her. Many times 
she had spoken of marriage, but it had never 
meant anything to Milo.
A knock on the open door woke Milo from 
his indulgent musings. He turned to find Annette 
standing in the doorframe, her blonde hair radiant 
like a Norwegian sunrise. She didn't seem to 
know what to expect and Milo saw this. He 
smiled and she came in.
"Milo, I, I" She lowered her eyes.
He stood up and moved to her and put his arms 
around her. He noticed then how rarely he'd ever 
taken such initiative before.
Her response was totally unexpected. She 
grabbed him as if she would never let go and he 
could hear she was crying.
"It's all right." he said, holding her. "Every
thing's okay."
And he knew it was true. Everything was 
going to be fine. So why did he feel so empty 
inside?

ENTERTAINMENT
by Ted Smits
Carnegie-Mellon University does not 
have a reputation for presenting the most 
diverse or entertaining concerts. There have 
been too few concerts and too many vir
tually unknown performers, even though 
most of the school concerts have been both 
enjoyable and entertaining. The Richie 
Havens concert on March 16 was a typical 
CMU event. The Skibo ballroom was only 
about half full, yet the crowd was treated 
to over two hours of exciting folk-rock.
Richie Havens public career has span
ned more than ten years. He first receiv
ed public notice with his appearance at the 
Woodstock music festival. Since then he 
has released a number of solo albums as 
well as appearing on many other albums. 
He has only had a few hits, namely Free
dom and Here Comes the Sun, but he has 
never been able to reach the commercial
successes many felt he was destined for. 
One reason for this lack of success is his in
dividual appraoch to music. Richie Havens 
has a virtually unique musical style; he uses 
his thumb to strum full chords over and 
over again at an extremely high rate of 
speed. The only time he plays any leads is 
while he is tuning up.
All of Richie Havens songs have two 
qualities. His songs are all played very in
tensely and they all sound very much alike. 
The similarity of his songs could have been 
a problem at his concert if not for the high 
level of intensity that Richie Havens brings 
to all his songs. He becomes so deeply in
volved m each song that the audience really 
does not care if the songs sound similar. He 
is a very mysterious, almost frightening, 
performer. He combines honest, meaning
ful lyrics with his rhythmic guitar playing 
to draw the listeners attention to every 
piece. The presence of lead guitarist Paul
Williams helped improve Havens sound as 
well as expand the musical range.
Havens performed some of his own 
work, as well as versions of Fire and Rain, 
Just Like a Woman, and even a short ver
sion of the William Tell Overture.
Richie Havens tried to play a few songs 
on the piano, but unfortunately, the sus
tain pedal was broken and the bench 
threatened to collapse any second because 
of a broken leg. After revealing the only 
real people in the world (there are only 
twelve people according to his song) he 
closed the show with an excellent version 
of Freedom.
Opening the show was Gene Corbin, a 
local folk-artist who has just released his 
first album entitled Caribbean Moon Over 
Pittsburgh. Corbins music is basic folkrock, similar to John Prine or Steve Good
man, but with some soul and funk influen
ces. Backed by bassist David Adomites,
Corbin played a number of songs from his 
new album, including Human Bean, Baby 
Blues, and Backpacking Blues. After an 
outstanding version of his albums title 
track, Gene Corbin and the bassist did an 
a cappella number, You Cant Stand Up 
Alone. Corbins performance was just as 
satisfying as that of Richie Havens, even 
though Corbins music also sounds a bit 
similar to many other folk singers.
After the show, I talked to Gene Corbin 
about his plans and his music. He told me 
that he will soon be leaving Pittsburgh and 
will probably go to New Mexico. The Pitt
sburgh musical scene, or lack of musical 
scene, is the reason Corbin and many 
other musicians cannot stay around this 
area. This is just one more reason why 
there should be more and better concerts 
at CMU. The next concert at school will be

Watercolors author discusses upcoming spring musical
Colored Girls magnificent
by David Sheward
Pittsburgh Public Theatre has moved its 
base of operations to the Eddy Theatre at 
Chatham College for the remainder of its 
season. That remainder is an explosion of 
poetry, dance, anger, humor, and enor
mous talent in the form Ntozake Shanges 
For Colored Girls Who Have Considered 
Suicide When The Rainbow Is Enuf. Playwrite Shange uses the voices of seven black 
actresses to express some of the frustra
tions and joys of being a black woman. 
Wearing all the colors of the spectrum, 
they are majestic and proud (Ladies in 
Red, Orange and Purple), sensuous and full 
of dance (Lady in Green), exuberant and 
youthful (Ladies in Brown and Yellow), 
funky and sassy (Lady in Blue.) 
The thrilling recitation of Shanges poems 
brought enthusiastic and audible responses 
from the opening night audience. The 
evening begins on a note of uncertainty 
and confusion, the poems dark phase, 
which articulates the black womans 
unclear position in society: she is without 
rhythm, without tune. This is followed by 
a narrative of a girl losing her virginity after 
a graduation night party. The rest of the 
evening is a journey from this point of 
innocence through the pain and torment of
rape, abortion, and love, climaxed by the 
now classic a nite with beau willie brown 
monologue in which the terrified Crystal 
watches her crazed lover beau willie drop 
their children from a fifth story window. 
The women manage to overcome even this 
and sing triumphantly, I Found God in 
Myself/and I love her fiercely.
Other highlights include an eight-yearolds love affair with an imaginary reincar
nation of Toussaint LOuverture, a biting 
mockery of apologies offered by men that 
dont help, a desperate womens imprison
ment in the six-block universe of Harlem, 
and a carnival strippers dusty, yet regal 
performance.
Director Regge Life and Choreographer 
John Parks make the piece a constantly 
moving one, both physically and emotionly. The uniformly brilliant cast is compos
ed of Judyie Brandt, Crystal Lilly, Pamela 
Poitier, Freda Scott, Carol E. Pennyfeather, Celestine Desaussure and Gail Grate, 
who happens to be a Carnegie-Mellon 
Drama student.
For Colored Girls is for anyone interested 
in a magnificent evening of theatre. For re
servations, Call the Pittsburgh Public 
theatre at 3231900.
Dancing wildly in the choreopoem, "I'm a poet who," are (foreground, from left) Gail Grate (LADY IN ORANGE) and Celestine Desaussure (LADY IN BLUE) and (background, from left) Crystal Lilly (LADY IN YELLOW) and Freda Scott (LADY IN RED), all members of the cast.
Richie Havens excites crowd with intense performance
by Alan Spero
The theme of the play is that happiness comes from the inside. 
You cant get it from fancy names, fancy jobs, or a fancy house, 
Karen Ravets said of her original musical production, Watercolors, 
which will be presented by Scotch *n Soda April 16 through 21 in 
the Skibo ballroom, The play is about a young country girl, Violet, 
who learns the lesson of the theme when she goes to the big city 
looking for happiness, even though she has everything she needs 
to be happy right at home.
Themusical contains over twenty songs, with the lyrics and 
book written by Miss Ravets and adapted by director Bill Tinsley.
Miss Ravets is a technical writing major with a strong interest 
in drama. She had always wanted to write a musical, and after see
ing last years S&S production, she came up with the idea for 
Watercolors, with the intent of developing it for next years pro
duction. But after she explained the idea to the S&S board, they 
told her to write it instead for this years show.
Its very frustrating writing a musical, she explained. Charac
ter development and coordination is difficult, especially when 
working with more than one plot at a time. Bill helped me adapt it; 
hes had more experience.
Miss Ravets is currently editing a manuscript, while at the same 
time working on a new play she hopes will be performed in this 
falls Scotch n Soda production. She is also news editor on the 
TARTAN staff.
Tickets for Watercolors can be purchased at the Skibo Infor
mation Desk and at the S&S booth in Baker Hall. Showtime for all 
performances is at 8:05 PM.Bill Tinsley will direct Karen Ravets' Watercolors" on April 1621 in the Ballroom.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern': a brilliant look at Hamlet
by Dan Livak
The Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre, as 
well known for their unusual seating ar
rangements and choices of production as 
they are for the high quality of those pro
ductions, seem to have altere'd their style a 
bit. Their current production is a popular, 
commercially successful play, and the 
seats have been arranged in a very tradi
tional manner; the quality of the acting, 
however, hasnt changed and is as highly 
polished as ever.
Hamlet is one of Shakepeares bestknown and most widely acclaimed play. In 
1965, Tom Stoppard, one of Englands top 
contemporary playwrights, (Every Good 
Boy Deserves Favour, Real Inspector 
Hound, Travesties) decided to use Hamlet 
x  as a source for a new play, Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern Are Dead, and the result 
can now be seen at the Lab.
Briefly, Hamlet is concerned with the 
plight of young Hamlet, Prince of Den
mark, as he moves against his evil step
father, who has secretly murdered Hamlets 
father, married his mother, and assumed 
the throne of Denmark. The King asks 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two court
iers and friends of Hamlet, to spy on him 
and ultimately to take him to England, 
where he can be murdered. In a turn of 
events, however, Hamlet causes Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern to be killed there 
instead.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead 
is a rather absurd, but brilliant look at 
Hamlet from the inside out. Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern are only pawns of the 
royal game being played at Elsinore, and 
therefore have only a limited knowledge 
concerning the activities going on there.
From left to right, David Crawford, Dan Love, and
Dead.
But, as Stoppard points out, they are also 
pawns for Shakespeare and his little game 
of intrigue and suspense.
All characters are the creations of their 
authors and therefore have no control over 
their own actions and destiny. Stoppard 
demonstrates this by writing a play which 
carries on on-stage what might happen 
off-stage during Hamlet. In Hamlet, Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern are buffeted from

Sherlock Holmes returns
by Joan Livitski
Super-sleuth Sherlock Holmes is by no 
means new to movie fans. An enormous 
number of films (134 to be exact) have 
featured Holmes remarkable detective 
work, yet the most recent presentation of 
Holmes in Murder By Decree depicts him 
and Watson as a little out of the usual con
ception.
The contrast isnt as startling as a be
fuddled Holmes. Were still given an intel
ligent, if not so intellectual, character. A 
little of the traditionally distant, pompous, 
and almost demeaning Holmes comes out 
in the onset of the film, but as we become 
more intimately introduced to the charac
ter (played by Christopher Plummer), we 
see a warmth, a human, compassionate 
side. This portrayal not only endears 
Holmes to the audience, but, in an era of 
super-heros, the show of feeling and touch 
of sentiment in Holmes makes the movie 
believable. .
The more extreme character change 
though is that of Dr. Watson (played by 
James Mason). Instead of the seemingly in* 
competent fool that hes usually shown to 
be, Murder By Decree spotlights a percep
tive man whos both a help, a friend, and 
a confidant of Holmes. We are shown a 
Watson that isnt just a tag along, but who
all sides by the royal Danish Court, appar
ently at Shakepeares mercy. In Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Stop
pard questions whether or not all men are 
so treated by their creator, and how much 
control we have over our own destiny.
David Crawford as Rosencrantz and 
Christopher Rawson as Guildenstern han
dle their parts beautifully, playing off one 
another like the Marx Brothers. They are
supported by Dean Hyland and his group 
of tragedians, as well as by the royal court.
All perform ably, but it is Crawfords and 
Rawsons show, and it is their perform
ances, combined with Stoppards witty 
writing which makes this show a success.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead 
will be presented Wednesdays through Sun
days, April 11 to 28. For more information 
call the Lab at 621-2876.
plays an integral part in solving the mys
tery. In fact, Mr. Masons performance is 
undoubtedly the one to center your at
tention on. Hes a gifted actor and does 
much to make the role well rounded.
Director Bob Clark, a Holmes enthusiast 
of long standing, admitted that he made 
changes in character which ultimately 
led to a change in the relationship between 
Holmes and Watson. Theres nothing to 
smirk at. The change is purely to a bond of 
friendshiprather than just mutual interest 
in case. This may be due to the continu
ing success of such teams as Redford and 
Newman, but what ever the case, it works. 
The two men offer a comic relief along the 
lines of the banter between Doolittle and 
Higgins in My Fair Lady. Surprisingly, 
this is handled so well that it doesnt inter
fere with the subject at hand.
The story concerns the tracking down 
of the infamous Jack the Ripper who was 
brutally butchering prostitutes in Londons 
East End. Like a Watergate conspiracy 
cover-up, the evidence leads Holmes and 
Watson right to the throne of England.
If youre an old Holmes fan and but
toned into the traditional, stuffed-shirt 
portrayal, you might find a discontent
ment in seeing Plummers Holmes shed a 
tear. Theres also a problem with a rather 
slow moving plot that is often re-capped 
and theorized over by Holmes or Watson or 
both. All this considered though, you

Volunteers help WYEP continue diverse programming
programs which feature all types of music, 
from blues, caribean, classical and disco, to 
rock and roll, fifties through new wave.
Well try anything once,Bill Askin, 
staff member says, explaining how what  
on the air gets there. And after a program 
airs once, the staff decides whether there 
is an audience for it, a decision which rests 
partially with listener feedback. Anyone 
whose broadcast sparks interest can present 
a show on a regular basis. For example, 
Alan and Roberta Bennet have been host
ing a two hour bluegrass program for more 
than a year now, carrying their own record 
collection to the station every Saturday 
morning.
As I type this, Portfolio, a live interview 
program, has two dentists from the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh Dental Clinic to discuss 
preventative and restorative dentistry. The 
interviewer, Marianne Scott, invites listen
ers to call up and ask them questions> 
WYEP frequently encourages listener part
icipation in everything from choosing the 
music to giving opinions over the air, 
or simply asking questions of the inter
viewees they Ire invited to the station. 
WYEP will mail out a free program guide 
on request.
WYEP is located in an Oakland ware* 
house at 4 Cable Place at the bottom of a 
splintered wooden staircase. Their anten
nae is on top of the Cathedral of Learning, 
broudcasting at 840 watts. The station  re
quest for more power is pending FCC 
ruling. But it  a catch-22, Askin points 
out, To get more power, we need permis
sion and we need money. Now, to get more 
money and more power. They won t help 
us expand until we ire expanded.  The 
government funding policy seems to be 
help those who help themselves, which 
seems fair, Askin admits, but it makes their 
expansion difficult, if not impossible.
Everyone at WYEP, program hosts and 
telephone answerers alike, is a volunteer. 
One member estimated that over a hundred 
people work in the station every week. 
With such a large number of people, it 3 
hard to keep up communications. I know 
that it sounds funny for me to say that in a 
radio station, Askin says. But since deci
sions are made by the Board of Directors, 
also volunteers, there $ no problem gather
ing everyone together to set station 
policies: new rules and ideas are passed to 
the staff through word of mouth and no
tices posted around the studio. Problems 
do arise though, due to the large staff, and 
they range from high telephone bills with 
no one claiming the calls and too many 
leftover pizza boxes to mistakes in writing 
grant proposals, queing records and stilttering the news.
An important concern at the station is 
community services. Volunteers compile 
information, news and events to provide 
such listings as Health Horizonsthe new
est research and results in medicine, Rides 
America-rides offered and rides needed, 
Art News ---listing the exhibitions in the 
galleries, films, festivals, contests and other 
cultural events, and News You Can Use 
just what it says.
A notice on the studio bulletin board re
minds program hosts that per hour, there 
should be two station promos, two public 
service announcements, a weather forecast 
and a request for new members. Responsi
bilities like these reflect the stations con
cern with public access: to be available for, 
give information to and be supported by 
the public. And while this repetition may 
be annoying (after and evening of listening, 
youve memorized the phone number: 687- 
0200), its far less mindless than that of 
commercial radio stations announcing new 
cars, new concerts and new mouthwashes. 
Were the listeners, too, Askin says,
you dont have to take what you get.
WYEP airs what the interested public likes 
and needs and if you dont like them, call 
them up and make a change. Relevant, en
joyable radio is as close at hand as that.
by Karen Locitzer
An article in the New York Times 
(1.26.79) describes non-commercial radio: 
...public stations help to provide a proli
feration of points of view and sources of 
information. Of Pittsburgh  three public 
radio stations (WYEP, WDUQ and WQED), 
WYEP, at 91.5 FM has the most diverse 
programming, offering, they hope, any
thing and everything you are interested in 
hearing--as well as things you may not be 
interested in until you hear them.
One morning, they played a historical 
and musical introduction to jazz, followed 
by a tape explaining the Nestle S boycott. 
Another afternoon, an interview with Paul 
Draper, a well-known dancer. Another in
terview asked a junoir high school teacher 
what he thought of kids and their educa
tion.
Regular features on WYEP include 
Vibrations II, a program exploring issues 
in the crimianl justice system, Women Hold 
Up Half the Sky, a program whose content 
varies weekly, featuring phone in discus
sions and feminest poets etc., and The Big 
Broadcast, airing music, plays and serials 
from the twenties and thirties. On Sunday 
afternoons, Isreal Sings, is followed by 
Arabic Heritage, which is an example of 
how diverse WYEP is. And the station has

try, jazz and southern rock, or as Chuck 
Leavell, former Allman Brothers member 
and current keyboardist of Sea Level says, 
Fusion Music. The theme is basically im
provisation and the result is a fast paced 
disc with excellent musicianship.
Almost half of the songs are instrument
al. The opener, Fifty Four, is a fast 
paced rocker with some excellent keyboard 
runs by Leavell. Other instrumental songs 
are On the Wing and A Lotta Colada. 
The latter is a strong jazz tune that includ
es some fiesty guitar work by Davis Caus
ey. Other notable songs King Grand, 
which showcases the underrated talent of 
Leavells keyboards, and This Could Be 
The Worst, a rhythmic piece penned by 
new addition, Randall Bramblett.
The band is essentially a reincarnation 
of the Allman Brothers. They continue the
improvisation theme with many of the 
songs on this album. King Grand, for ex
ample, explodes into a lengthy iam session 
that includes some free form melody lines. 
Sea Level has taken its music out of the re
strictive realm of southern rock and moved 
into a rather progressive format. That is, 
they are leaving some of the Allman heri
tage behind, and are starting to branch into 
sounds like that of Steely Dan. Many of 
the songs remind one of Steely Dans easy 
melodic style. Although the vocals are a lit
tle weak, the instrumental interludes are 
just as well done as Steely Dans.
The catchy melodies sometimes mask' 
the finer subtleties of the album. The gui-. 
tar work, for instance, is sometimes lost in 
the mix. This is rather unfortunate because 
Davis Causeys work shouldnt go unnotic
ed.
The commercial success of the album is 
rather doubtful, but if one is looking to 
expand his musical horizons, this album is 
worth a listen.
"Fever"becomes family fare
(CPS)To the thousands of Saturday 
Night Fever fans who thrilled to the con
tours of John Travoltas white pants, and 
who shivered in titillation or distaste at 
the gang-bang scene: treasure those memo
ries.
Last month, Paramount Pictures gath
ered up every one of the 1.080 prints of 
the film in distribution. After a little stu
dio magic, Fever will reappear in March 
and April, with a PG rating where once 
there was an R.
Paramount told Variety that a large 
share of the market was cut out by the 
films under-17-not-admitted rating. So 
the studio is cutting seven minutes of the 
originals verbal obscenity and graphic 
sexual encounters, and embellishing it with 
some cover shooting and dubbing. 
Then Paramount is spending roughly 
$2 million to re-introduce PG Fever, 
and figures the innate appeal of the 
Bee Gees disco soundtrack and John 
Travolta will bring the teeners on a run.
The Film company had contemplated 
making a PG version as early as last Feb
ruary. But, says senior domestic sales 
vice-president Frank Mancuso, we realized
the film was performing too strongly to 
risk limiting the momentum of the R 
version by bringing in a PG. Thus far, 
Fever has brought back 571,463,000 to 
Paramount in film rentals.
So now, all Paramount has to worry about is the possiblity of an R Fever 
being shipped out by mistake. Variety 
reports that until all prints are altered, 
Paramount is laying out substantial coin 
to ensure their safety, thus dampening the 
possibility of seeing a bootleg Fever 
showing.

X-rated movies hit rough-going at college
(CPS)T-eachers are usually given a tree 
rein in selecting materials for instruction  
unless of course, the instructional material 
turns out to be X-rated films.
In two recent cases, professors were 
denied further use of the dirty movies  
which were of necessity part of the curric
ulum  by school or local authorities. At 
the University of West Florida, Professor 
Churchill Roberts showed Deep Throat 
in the course of teaching obscenity law. 
Students were to decide if the film was 
obscene. Apparently, Pensacola law had
already decided it was. Local police con
fiscated the film, and a judge ordered it 
destroyed.
The Florida Supreme Court, though, is 
considering an appeal against the seizure, 
which Roberts lawyer George Estess says 
violated Roberts rights of free speech, due 
process, and property. But, according to 
the Chronicle of Higher Education, Assis
tant Attorney General Randy Schwartz 
argued that seizure was legal under a state 
law that holds that the rights of property 
do not apply when the material is obscene.
Similarly, at the University of TexasAustin, English professor Joseph Krupp is 
mad because he cant get any X-rated films 
for his Eroticism in Literature class. 
I needed to get X-rated films for my class 
...I couldnt get them on campus because 
of an unwritten law that probably goes all 
the way to the presidents office, he told 
the Daily Texan. The administration agreed, sort of. Richard Heller, coordinator 
of student activities, admitted that the 
dean of students7 office had adopted a po
licy against showing X-rated movies.
Meanwhile, two campus film societies, 
both run by professors, are felling the long 
arm of the law .Maryland Universitys Com
pany Cinema Tech showed an uncut ver
sion of Bel Ami last fall, and after chas
tisement from the Maryland State Censor 
Board, is expecting prosecution from the 
States Attorney.
The University of Cincinnatis Film 
Society, though, didnt even want to 
take a chance. They scheduled a showing 
of The Devil in Miss Jones, but decided 
to cancel when they learned that city vice 
squad officers were planning to attend.

Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet) and 
the Magic Band have just released a new 
album, Shiny Beast, and despite all the 
attempts by Don Van Vliet to turn one away from his record, there is still some
thing worthwhile within to warrant a listners perserverance.
The music itself throughout the LP 
frequently borders on very nice., easy 
listening and sometimes progressive jazz, 
although the lyrics and - the man singing 
them tries valiantly to contradict that. 
There are two totally instrumental pieces 
on the album, Ice Rose and Suction Prints, 
and both are among the better entries. The 
musicianship is more than adequate, the 
composition and phrasing different and the 
ultimate sound, enjoyable. On a few cuts, 
the musical introductions are 'almost as 
nice but then Vliet starts wailing the most 
incoherent lyrics and only serves to clutter 
up the rest of the song. Surprisingly, there 
is one exception buried on Side Two,
Love Lies. Vliet mixes his voice, lyrics and 
music and actually comes out with some
thing beautiful.
Has our love lost all its power 
I said I'd be here with our flower 
Street lamps flutter like fireflies 
I wish I hadnt told you 
All those love lies
Billed as a poet, lyricist, composer, 
painter, and musician, Beefheart is an art
ist of many talents. Shiny Beast (Bay Chain 
Puller) is his first album in more than 
four years and in it he combines all of his 
trades. He even closes side one with a po
em, Apes-Ma, (which, by the way, went 
completely past me). Unfortuantely, the 
Captain tries to do too much here. If the 
album were minus his artwork, poetry, and 
singing, I honestly fee! it would have a 
better chance to make it in the record 
shops. As it stands, the loyal Beefheart fans 
will probably be his best bet for support.

In,the six short years since the clinic 
opened as Pittsburghs first provider of 
safe, legal and humane abortions. Womens 
Health Services has begun  officially and 
unofficially  to offer a broad range of 
programs geared to the needs of its clients, 
and the list of programs is still growing.
We started out with a basic concept: 
we saw this organization, from day one, as 
a service to meet the expressed needs of 
women. Abortion was to be our primary 
service, but by no means our only one, 
says Leah Sayles, executive director.
Womens Health Service opened in April 
of 1973, following the Supreme Courts 
ling which legalized abortion. From the 
irst it was apparent that some of the wo
men who came to the clinic for abortions 
had other life problems. As a result, the 
clinic soon began to offer professional 
counseling.
Once here, when they found they were 
well treated, many of the patients made 
it clear they would return for follow-up 
care, but they would not go elsewhere. So, 
Womens Health Services began offering 
contraceptive care to its former abortion 
clients. From there it was but a short step 
to offering these same women on-going 
gynecological care.
For a long time, W7HS did not open its 
gynecological services to the general public. 
It took a clients complaint to do that.
The clinic also began to offer sexual 
enrichment programs, some of which were 
available to other agencies, but often only 
at high cost.
The clinics diagnostic program has been 
growing, too, with better pregnancy test
ing, a new sonar machine for more accurate 
determinations of fetal development, and 
a whole range of more sophisticated med
ical care.
The most recent addtion to Women's 
Health Services sexuality program is the 
couples therapy clinic, which has been in 
operation since August, under the direc
tion of Maurice Cerul, M.D.
Couplls who come to the clinic work 
together with an individual therapist. 
Each couple is seen once a week for a 
period of between three and six months.
Some of the sexual dysfunctions which 
have been treated by the therapists inTHEREJS A 
DIFFERENCE!
1*1
NiOelude impotence and erectile difficulties, 
orgasmic problems and lack of sexual de
sire experienced by some people.
The phone room will now be open 
Saturdays from 9 AM to 4 PM as well a 
from Monday through Friday from 9 AM 
to 4 PM. This means that clients will 
able to schedule appointments at the clinic 
on Saturdays as well as on week-days. Peo
ple who would like to speak to a phone 
room counselor should call 562-1910.
For more information about the Cou
ples Therapy Program, contact Womens 
Health Service at 562-1900.
A Supreme Court Decision, handed 
down January 9, struck down a Pennsyl
vania state law requiring doctors to try- to 
save the life of a fetus that may be cap
able of surviving outside the womans 
womb.
The decision, in effect, gives attending 
physicians the authority to make their own 
judgments about the point of viability,  
that is, the point at which the fetus would 
survive outside the womb.
In effect, the -Supreme Courts riding 
means that doctors may perform abortions 
in a woman's fifth or sixth month of 
pregnancy without the fear of criminal 
prosecution.
Womens Health services provides a variety of individual and group therapy sessions to its clieiits.

CMU Security Officer 
to Retire
Security Notes
Several thefts were reported over the 
Spring Break period. A typewriter, valued 
at $750 was reported missing on March 23.
And on April 4, a bike with a reported 
value of $150 was reported taken from the 
Skibo bike racks.
Also on March 23, 11 chairs were re
ported stolen from the Margaret Morrison 
building. These chairs had an estimated 
value of $1,600.
Together, the signs of spring on CMUs 
:ampus add up to equal more possessions 
stolen and greater threats to personal
safety.
Bicycles are easily sold on the underthe-counter market. Unless chained securally, they will disappear. Spring Carnival 
attracts many people to the campus wno 
do not come to
shows.
Instead, they seek unsuspecting victims 
for crimes as slight as petty theft to grand 
crimes like rape. Awareness of the location 
of campus security phones and the report
ing of any suspicious-looking individuals 
to security should help to deter the acts of 
visitors to CMU who do not mean the 
campus community well.
Finally, because students become more 
mindful of the class work and less of other 
elements of their life as exams approach, 
many collegians leave their room or office 
doors unlocked through absent minded
ness.
Park your bicycle in a well lighted area, 
secure to a bicycle rack. Remember, if you 
chain your bike to a stairway, tree or park, it may be removed by security.
Register your bicycle with operation I.D. 
with the city police. This is not law, but it 
helps prevent thefts and helps recover on 
that is stolen.
Use a strong chain and a good locking 
device, we recommend the Kryptonite 
Bicycle Lock.

By Andrew L. Ragan
Hes seen student attitudes change from 
bitter and rebellious to friendly and com
municable. Hes investigated all types of ac
cidents, including fatal ones, and attemp
ted suicides. Hes a friend of University 
administration, maintenance personel, 
faculty and students. And, hes escorted 
senators, congressmen and other officials.
He is Investigating Officer Russel 
Meyers, who retired from the Security 
Staff of CMU on May 1, 1979, after thir
teen years of service here. Officier Meyers 
trained to become a policeman through the 
Pittsburgh Police Department and the 
County of Allegheny. He worked as a Pitts
burgh Policeman for twenty-two years be
fore joining CMU Security as Investigator 
in 1966.
Ive enjoyed working with CMU stu
dents a great deal, said the retiring of
ficer in a recent interview. I dont think 
one could find a better group of people to 
work with.
Being an investigator wasnt always that 
easy, though, according to Meyers. 
Switching jobs in 1966 was quite a chal
lenge. In those days, as policemen, we 
sometines viewed people with long hair as
simply out to give us trouble. The differ
ences were like night and day. When I came 
here, I had to change those attitudes. Be
cause of Securitys relationship with the 
students, I found out soon that under
neath all that long hair was a lot of good
ness.
Nevertheless, in comparison with stu
dents of the 60s, Officer Meyers says that 
rapport with students today is at least 75% 
better.
It was much harder to communicate 
with students then. They were more rebel
lious. Its interesting to see, though, that 
many of the students who were hard to get 
along with then now work right alongside 
us in the University today.
Ive had my share of excitement, too, 
said the officer. The investigator told of 
the single week early in his CMU career, 
when three people died in three seperate 
freak accidents on campus. He also men
tioned other stories of suicides and rob
beries, and, of course, his escorting famous 
people such as Senators Strom Thurmond 
and Frank Church.
'The Investigator concluded My few 
years here have been a good experience... 
Officer Meyers plans to maintain corre
spondence with CMU security and the 
campus, and he will not be idle in his re
tirement. He has been elected one of 12 
aides to the Templar of the local Syria 
Temple and will be travelling in that po
sition.
He was honored by fellow' security 
staffers, faculty and University administra
tors, including President Cyert, on March

Plan for Commencement Now
by Doug Kirsop
Although Spring Carnival is the big 
event on almost everyones mind right 
now, seniors have an even more important 
day to look forward to, their graduation on 
May 14th.
Seniors whose parents live out of town 
should start making plans for the ceremony 
now by making reservations at a hotel as 
soon as possible.
A recent check of local hotels showed 
that all have plenty of space for com
mencement weekend now, reservations 
however should be made soon, and cer
tainly not later than the end of April.
The Carlton House is the only hotel 
the TARTAN checked into that had 
any group (this group turned out to be 
the Cincinatti Reds) scheduled for gradu
ation weekend. The price of a single or 
double room at the Carlton for a Friday, 
Saturday, or Sunday night is $33.
A check of some other guest houses 
showed that a single is $25 per night, and 
a double is $29 at the Airport Hotel. An 
advantage of staying at this inn is that the 
management will hold a reservation until 
10:00 PM, not just until 6:00 PM, as with 
most places.
Reservation rates at the Marriot Inn are 
$34 for a single and $39 for a double. The 
Pittsburgh Hilton offers various prices for 
both singles and doubles, with an average 
single running $44, and an average double 
running $52. A double at the Holiday Inn 
is $37.
Keep in mind that a 7% tax is added to 
all of these rates, and that this is only a 
random sampling of some of the larger 
places.
Dont let your relatives be caught with
out a place to stay for graduation. Make 
your reservations today!
Survey Reveals Student Attitudes
I. P.  Self-doubt may be the key remain
ing barrier to full educational equality at 
Brown University and other similar institu
tions, suggest the preliminary findings of a 
study of coeducation released recently. 
The study involved a 50-question attitude 
and behavior survey.
But beyond that fragility in self-esteem 
and sense of self, the women students 
profiled in the study seemed, researchers 
said, not much different from their male 
peers in their response to the academic en
vironment. The survey, administered 
randomly to 2,076 women and 1,271 men 
in the four undergraduate classes of Brown, 
Dartmouth, Wellesley, Princeton, Barnard, 
and the State University of New York at 
Stony Brook, included the following initial 
findings:
Attitudes, Interpersonal Relationships 
About three-quarters of both men and 
women reported that sexuality is an impor
tant part of their lives, and by their senior 
year less than 15 percent of both sexes 
reported they had not had a sexual relationship.
Academic-Nearly three-quarters 0f 
both men and women felt faculty offered 
helpful advice, taught important skills 
helped them feel confident, positively 1 
acknowledged their ideas, or gave reading 
and writing assignments very valuable to 
academic growth.

CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS
HOW TO CHOOSE 
THE RIGHT SIZE ENGINE
BIGGER ISNT NECESSARILY BETTER IN NEW, MORE EFFICIENT GM CARS.
The lighter the car, the 
less power it takes to move it. 
Thats the most important 
thing to know when youre 
trying to decide what engine 
to order for your car.
The power-to-weight 
theory holds true no matter 
how you intend to use your 
car: city, highway or subur
ban driving; with two passen
gers or six; with a small 
trailer or pulling a heavy 
boat.
Since we redesigned al
most all our cars to make 
them lighter and more effi
cient, the power-to-weight 
theory enables us to move 
them with smaller engines 
that use less gas. You can get 
good performance from a 
full-size GM car under most 
conditions with a six-cylinder 
or a small eight-cylinder en
gine instead of a larger op
tional V8. Mid-size cars, 
luxury cars, and redesigned 
compacts to be introduced 
this spring follow the same 
pattern.
Tb help you choose an 
engine, we designate one as 
standard for every model. It is an engine that provides
enough acceleration to merge 
safely with traffic when 
entering a freeway, enough 
pick-up to cross a street 
quickly after heeding a stop 
sign, and in most models, even 
enough power to haul a trailer 
weighing up to 1,000 pounds.
Standard engines cost 
less than bigger, optional 
engines and get better gas 
mileage, especially in city 
traffic. There is no difference 
in durability between stan
dard and optional engines. 
However, to get the most out 
of any GM engine, follow the 
maintenance schedule in the 
GM Owners Manual. And 
remember, please, that small 
engines are as durable as 
large engines only if you give 
them the same care.
There are some reasons 
for choosing larger, optional 
engines: if you intend to 
carry six passengers and lug
gage with any frequency, if 
you intend to haul a trailer 
over 1,000 pounds, and if you 
expect to drive often in hilly 
terrain. For people who drive 
mainly in altitudes over 4,000 
feet we offer a special highaltitude package, including a 
larger engine, to ensure satis
factory perform^''0
Finally, your own sense 
of how a car should "feel 
must be the deciding factor.GM dealers have cars that 
you can take for a test drive. 
Take that test drive. Drive 
the same model with a stan
dard and an optional engine, 
if the dealer has "demonstra
tors with both configura
tions. Youre the driver. 
Decide for yourself.
We charge more for op
tional engines. Even so, our 
honest advice is to buy the 
smallest engine that fits your 
taste and needs. Youll save 
money when you buy your 
car, and in most cases, youll 
save money on gas for as long 
as you own it. Thats the nice

On March 15, 16 and 17, five CMU 
swimmers travelled to Geneseo, NY, for 
the NCAA Division III National Champion
ships. This was the final meet of the 1978- 
79 season in which the Tartans, under the 
coaching of Donna Pecman, placed fourth 
in the President's Athletic Conference. 
Represented at Nationals were 72 Division 
HI teams including Allegheny, John 
Carroll, W & J and CMU from the PAC.
The 400 yard Medley Relay team of Joe 
Mickey, Jim Matysek, Harry Coleman and 
Nick Watts swam their second best time of 
the year to place fifteenth, just short of 
All-American status; to qualify as AllAmerican you must place in the top 
twelve. Bob Frye, the first CMU diver to 
Mualify for Nationals, faired well; he placed 
J~nd out of a field of 57 divers in the one 
nieter competition.
if. .I
The next day, CMU swimmers compet
ed in two more individual events. Harry 
Coleman, who was All-American in the 100 
yard butterfly last yeat, faced stiffer 
competition this year. His time of 53.82 
seconds placed 18th, short of All-American 
status. Jim Matysek placed sixth in the 00 
yard breaststroke with a time of 1:01.8 
seconds', qualifying for All-American. The 
next day, Matysek achieved All-American 
status again by placing fifth in the 200 
yard breaststroke. Matysek, a sophomore 
in Electrical Engineering, was voted MVP 
for the season by the Tartan team.
Overall, the Tartans did quite well, 
placing 21st out of 72 teams. Allegheny 
was the only team from the PAC to beat 
the Tartans with an excellent finidi of 
fourth place overall.

me CMU Thinclads defeated Case 
Western Reserve and Washington and Jeff
erson in a dual meet last Saturday at Tech 
Field. The Tartar^ easily beat both visiting 
teams as they defeated Case 8560 and 
blew away W&J 110-34. For Cases squad, 
it was only their second dual meet loss in 
eleven years.
The Tartans were impressive as they 
won 11 out of 17 events. They won both 
the 440 and mile relays. In the mile run, 
Larry Gordon, Craig Woolheater, and Greg 
Lentz swept the first three places respect
ively. Ken Halliner won the 440 yard run 
in an impressive early season time 51.8 
seconds. Mike Buelah won the 100 yard 
run and placed second in the 220 yard run. 
Jeff Klaiber defeated the defending PAC 
champ in the 880 yard run by a healthy 
margin. Joe Gold champ won the 440 
yard hurdles.
Dario Donatelli posted a good season 
start time for the three mile run as he de
feated Peter Kumount of Case. Donatellis 
time of 14:29.4 brought him to finish 10
seconds ahead of the former All-American 
Kumount.
The Tartans also swept the field events 
with Steve -Holmes impressive win in the 
triple jump of 43.1. Ed OBrien won the 
long jump and Matt Wehrde was victorious 
in the high jump.
Other Tartans earning places in .the 
track events were : David McDaniels and 
OBrien in the 120 yard hurdles, Dave 
Johnson in the 440 yard hurdles, Joe 
Giancini in the 100, Dave Delo in the 440 
hurdles, and Woolheater in the three mile.
Among those earning places in the field 
events were: George Canepa in the triple 
jump, Bob Hyland in the long jump, Joe 
Wagner in the javelin, Pete Hall in the shot 
and discus, Bob Kromer in the pole vault, 
and Chris Grinnell in the shot.
The outlook for this years track team 
looks very bright if these results are to be 
an indication. Next Saturday the Tartans 
travel to Case Western for the PAC relays 
and a chance to really test their true abili
ties.

Volleyballers coasting
The CMU volleyball club, defending 
champions of the Western Pa. Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association, are in a tie for 
first place with IUP after three weeks of 
league play. Both teams show one loss.
CMU started the season by crushing 
WVU three games to none by the scores of 
15-9, 15-8, 15-6. Next fell California State 
College, 15-11, 15-9. The Penn State New 
Ken match went three games, CMU winn
ing 15-12, 10-15, 16-14.
At Indiana in a wild rematch of last 
years championship, CMU edged IUP 
15-5, 16-14,3-15, 16-14. CMU fought back 
after a 12-5 defeat in the first game, blew 
out IUP in the second game, came from 
behind in the third, totally fell apart in the
forth, but rallied from a 10-2 defeat in the 
fifth game to take the match.
The club then trounced Edinboro at 
home, 2-0, only to drop the rematch with 
IUP, 11-15, 15-9, 2-15. Again off to a slow 
start, CMU spotted IUP a 10-1 lead before 
making it a close. In the second game, a 
ferocious offense racked up ten quick 
points before coasting to a 15-9 win. But, 
in a disappointing repeat of previous per
formances, CMU fell apart in the deciding 
game.
Matches remain on the schedule with 
Slippery Rock and Alleghany. If the CMU 
team remains in first place, the WPIVA 
playoffs will again be hosted in the Skibo 
gym in late April.
