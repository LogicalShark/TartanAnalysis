AMS program to be revamped
Professor O'Nan 
promoted .
Robert Kaplan, Dean of GSIA, has re
commended a substantial revision of the 
AMS program. Every course is not de
cided on, but the new program structure 
has been outlined.
Most students will take the first two 
years of the program in H & SS, building 
on the newly instituted core liberal-profes
sional program there. Electives in the first 
and second years will have to be used to 
take two semesters of calculus, probability,, 
statistics, finite mathematics, and an intro
duction to operations research. Students 
will still be able to start in CIT or MIS, but 
must take the probability/statistics and lin
ear algebra/O.R. sequences in their second 
year along with required psychology and 
economies courses.
GSIA has been largely responsible for 
the undergraduate curriculum, but -under 
the new format it will not be responsible 
for any course during a students first two 
years, unless -it is decided that financial 
accounting will be taught in the second 
semester sophomore year. In the junior 
and senior years, a one-semester course will 
be offered in each major area of manage
ment. The number of AMS electives will be 
reduced, and the undergraduate students 
will be encouraged to take a broader set 
of non-AMS courses.
Kaplan stated, I hope that this new 
program, combining a solid introduction in 
the humanities, writing, mathematical and 
social sciences with management courses in 
the junior and senior year, works out to be 
as attractive as I now envision it to be.
In light of Professor Thomas Kerrs re
signation from his position as Head of AMS 
(see article this page), Dean Kaplan stated
Professor Thomas Kerr has resigned from his position as Head of AMS. Regarding the AMS pro
gram changes, he says,"There is nothing wrong with change or trying a new way."
that Kerr has served ably and diligently 
as Head of the AMS program, and that 
Kerrs reasons for resigning were so that 
he can devote more time to researching and 
writing law review articles, and to have 
more time for teaching.
Professor Mary ONan has been pro
moted to Coordinator of Undergraduate 
Programs of GSIA. She will have overall 
responsibility for administering the AMS
program and for counseling AMS students. 
Professor Ned Evans has agreed to assist 
Professor ONan in this latter function. 
Professor ONan will also provide adminis
trative support to the economics program.
Dean Kaplan concluded, Having one 
person whose sole commitment and re
sponsibility are to undergraduates should 
enable us to deliver effective and desirable 
programs.
Kerr resigns as 
Head of AMS
by Kevin Markweil
Professor Thomas Kerr has announced 
that he is resigning as head of the Admin
istration and Management Sciences Depart
ment. He has issued the following prepared 
statement to the campus news media.
I have resigned (without personal re
gret) as Head of AMS.
AMS is only one part of GSIA. The 
administration of GSIA is responsible for 
the entire school and for decisions respect
ing allocation of its scarce resources (in
cluding over-all problems and concerns of 
which I^may not be aware). The adminis
tration should have sub-administrators who 
agree with these choices (Organizational 
Behavior I!).
I perceive (and I certainly should never 
be quite sure that I am not in error) that 
GSIA intends to allocate relatively less of 
its resources to the undergraduate AMS 
program. It is fitting for me to respectfully 
dissent, but having demurred I should step 
aside. (Organizational Behavior II?).
I very much applaud and support the 
recommended changes in the first two 
years of the AMS program, now almost fin
ally determined. (See article this page.) 
They will provide AMS students a solid in
troduction in the humanities', writing, 
mathematical, and social sciences. I have 
long held these to be essential basic train
ing for managers.
We all wish Dr. ONan well in her ap
pointment as Coordinator of Undergradu
ate Programs for GSIA.
Compared with programs other univer
sities offer management undergraduates, 
ours has been exceptional. There is nothing 
wrong with change or trying a new way. 
The new Dean, the new Coordinator, and 
the new program should have full chance 
and best wishes for success.
Professor Kerr would comment no 
further.
25% turn-out at the polls; Tumazos elected
by Lennie Matjasko
1,044 students voted in the Student 
Senate/Student Government President 
elections held last Thursday and Friday, 
March 9 and 10. This figure represents 
25% of all full-time CMU students. (Last 
Marchs Senate/President election drew 
1,011 voters.)
John Tumazos was elected President of 
Student Government. He captured 62% 
of the vote ( a total of 643 votes).
Danni Smith and Elaine Smith won the 
two open Senate seats in the College of 
H&SS; Cynthia Lubon and Mary Ann Law
ton the two open seats in CIT; and Robin 
Niesenbaum, Gary Moshier, and Daniel 
Monaco, the three open seats in the College 
of Fine Arts. (All CFA winners were writeins; there were no petitions submitted from 
CFA students.)
In response to the referendum, Should 
the Student Activities Fee be raised from 
$25 to $30 per year to permit funding of 
activities at the level now approved by the 
Student Senate? 63% voted yes, 33% 
no, and 4% abstained.
See complete election results on page 6.
With a total of 643 votes, John Tumazos was 
elected student Government President. His philosophy:"The role of a leader is to serve."
by Lennie Matjasko
 My primary emotions are gratitude, 
jubilation, fatigue and anticipation. These 
were the words of newly-elected Student 
Government President John Tumazos at, 
7:30 Friday evening when he heard of his 
victory.
Tumazos defeated Greg Ellis and Scott 
Sibley, and will hold the office of Student 
Government President for one full year. He 
stated, My philosophy is that its nice to 
be king, but the role of a leader is to serve. 
Ill start working when I get some book 
work done.
Tumazos expressed his gratitude for all 
the help he received with his campaign. He 
explained, I sincerely feel that my cam
paign was run more professionally than 
most local politicians campaigns-say, tor 
| instance, the Mayor of Punxsutawney. I 
| had the help and support of the shrewd 
a politicians of the campus, people who have 
had a lot of experience with campus elec
tions. John specifically mentioned David 
Roussos, Don Simon, and John Lubon as 
some of his strongest supporters.

CMU student media 
represented at White HouseSDC space
by Chas Sislen
As part of the WRCT news staff, I rep
resented Camegie-Mellon at a day-long 
White House press conference held on 
March 2 for selected representatives of the 
college media. The conference was given as 
part of a continuing effort to open the 
White House to the public.
Included in the conference was a half 
hour with President Jimmy Carter. One of 
the first questions posed to him concerned 
the Marston matter and whether or not a 
House investigrtion of it would restore 
public trust in government Carter respon
ded, There is nothing about the Marston 
matter at all that causes any regret to me 
except the extraordinary publicity that has 
been brought to it. ... So I would not 
hesitate to recommend any presentation of 
the facts about the liarston case.
The questions then focused on the 
economy. Carter was asked whether he has 
auy specific inflation-fighting policies that 
he pisn to submit to Congress. The Pres
ident statedT"^We haw set a goal for our
selves to reduce the inflation rate substan
tially below 5 percent. That is compatible 
with the other elements of our economic 
package, to increase the GNP four or five 
percent per year and to cut the unemploy
ment rate down as well. In response to 
a question concering the lack of world con
fidence in U.S. currency, Carter outlined 
three factors which will increase the 
strength of the dollar: (1) a decrease in UJS. 
dependence on foreign oil; (2) a growth in 
U.S.'exports; and (3) more foreign invest
ment in U.S. markets.
On me college scene, President Carter 
said he will not accept the congressional 
bill for tuition tax credit. Rather, he ad 
vocates a program that would increase 
direct grants to students when they come 
from low and middle income families [and 
that would] authorize an increase in loans 
to students and families from low, middle 
income and a little bit higher level of 
income. The President stated that this 
program will increase the number of stu
dents eligible for loans, grants and workstudy from about three million this year to 
five million when the program is put into
effect. He emphasized, The cost of this 
will be less than one-half of the so-called 
income tax credits. It will also give aid to 
families that are most in need; to families 
that have a fairly good income, say 
$20,000, who would have two young 
people in school and so forth.**
Dave Rubinstein, Assistant Secretary for 
Domestic Affaris, answered some questions 
concerning the home front. He said that 
the Carter administrations chief concern is 
energy, and expressed the probability that 
the President would issue the Taft-Hartley. 
Mr. Rubinstein listed the passing of the 
Panama Canal treaty as the administra
tions second priority. Following these, 
Carters priorities are: tax reform, cutting 
inflation, reorganization of the civil service, 
a coordination to stop the decay of Amer
ican cities, a national health insurance, and 
a reform in the present welfare system.
Mr. Carter concluded by stressing that 
the future of America is in the hands of 
the lucky few who are in Americas 
universities. He asked for our faith and 
support.

by Carolyn E. Stewart
Last weeks Boss Hall party sparked a 
controversy about private party funding 
at last Sundays SDC meeting. Abby 
Selman, Vice-president of the Hill dorms, 
made a motion to reject the signatures for 
SDC funds because admission was charged 
at the door. She cited the second amend
ment of the private party regulations which 
specifically prohibit the collection of 
money at the door or any other means of 
making a profit.
Bill Sisak, the representative for Boss 
Hall pointed out that the amendment does 
not specifically prohibit charging admis
sion, but that it only prohibits making a 
profit.
John Skaggs moved to pay Bill Sisak the 
fifty dollars needed to finance the party in 
lieu of the funds he would have received 
from the signatures. He also suggested that 
the second amendment be clarified.
Later, an amendment was added to the 
regulations which allows donations to be 
collected at parties but which prohibits 
'anyone from being turned away for not 
contributing funds.
Also discussed at last weeks meeting 
was the problem of room retention for the 
Webster Hall students. Because Webster 
Hall is closing, the fifty-four students now 
living there cannot retain their rooms. 
Gerald Dalton, Director of Housing, had 
asked SDC for some suggestions about this 
problem. After considerable discussion, 
the council decided that if these students 
had been told that their housing at Webster 
Hall was only temporary, then they 
should take part in the regular room draw. 
If they had not been told this, then they 
should be allowed to obtain or retain a 
similar room anywhere on campus. Corey 
Chase suggested that SDC should refer this 
problem back to the Housing Office.
John Tumazos, candidate for Student 
Government President, spoke to the coun
cil, outlining his campaign platform and 
asking for support.
Chas Sislen, OJ and field news director at WRCT, represented CMU media in Washington on March 2.

Senate completes budget hearings
by Linda Deak
Dr. Pepper cans, cigarette butts, and 
empty Dorito bags littered the room. Papers 
were strewn among the clustered and over
turned plastic chairs. This was Skibo room 
45 when Student Senate finally finished its 
budget hearings.
Most senators abhor the first two weeks 
of March, or budget time. They vow to 
bring sleeping bags and thermos jugs to the 
grueling four-hour meetings. This year, 
Senate was forced to hold three such meet
ings in order to represent all funded clubs 
and organizations.
The proceedings of each meeting are a 
bit monotonous. Each organization has I previously met with the Finance Commit
tee, where a budget was drafted for the 
final hearing. When a clubs budget comes 
before the Senate, any senator is allowed 
to question an item, or even motion that 
items be added to the budget. Needless to 
say, this scrutiny entails a lot of discussion 
and a lot of time.
All clubs and organizations funded by 
l Senate draw their money from the pooled 
students activities fee. Students have been 
paying an annual $25 activities fee. At 
schools comparable in size to CMU, the 
activities fee is often much higher. How
ever, partly in response to the referendum 
in the recent election, the fee may be raised 
to $30. (63% of those who voted were in 
favor of the hike.)
P Senate has already decided affirmatively 
on the issue, because, claims Finance Chair
person Dan Cordes, It is necessary to raise 
[the activities fee] so that we can provide 
the students with the same amount of ser
vice that they are currently getting.
The Senate budget hearings finished up last Tuesday evening. The results of these hearings must still be approved by the Board of Trustrees
Although the Finance Committee re
viewed the 78-79 budgets with the in
crease in mind, this years base figure for 
budgets also calls for an increase. The pro
jected amount for next years student ac
tivities fee totals $113,000, based on an 
estimated 4520 students paying a $25 fee. 
However, as is evident from the figures be
low, Senate has already allocated $1 15,858.
This total is complicated by the fact 
that Senate must keep as a mandated re
serve 4% of the projected income figure. In 
addition to this expense, a reserve for fall 
allocations to such groups as Thistle, Spring 
Carnival, and Scotch n Soda is necessary. 
On top of this, Senate policy dictates that 
a reserve for new allocations be kept
The projected figures for next year have 
been calculated:
Estimated 4520 students
paying $25 fee.............................$113,000
Estimated 4520 students
paying $30 fee............................$135,600
Allocated for clubs and
organizations 78-79..................$115.8S8
Mandated reserve....................................5,424
Reserve for fall
allocations.............................................9,200
Reserve for new
allocations.............................................5,000
total $135,482
Lois Cox, Assistant Dean of Student 
Affairs, feels that if the activities fee isnt 
raised, current allocations must be brought 
down to the projected income of $113,000. 
This would necessitate drastic budget cuts.
The referendum appearing on the elec
tion ballot this past week indicates that 
students are in favor 2 to 1 of paying a $30 
fee. Even though Senate and the students 
support the increased fee, the Board of 
Trustees must still vote on the issue. They 
will, in effect, decide if the clubs listed be
low will be budgeted in the amounts 
requested.

Swank claims 
more social 
outlets needed
by Ed Frankenberry
Dean of Student Affairs Earle Swank 
plans to improve social outlets available 
on campus. One proposal he is considering 
for the fall is to increase the amount of 
co-ed dormitory space. Another plan 
includes working with Anne Witchner 
(Director of Student Activities) to in
crease the number of dances and spec
ials at the Tartan Grill.
Swanks opinion that students need 
more opportunities for social interactions 
as opposed to entertainment, was 
prompted by student talks with President 
Cyert and confirmed through feedback 
from the counselling center. Because of 
information from these sources, he believes 
that the success of the learning process 
theprinciple purpose of this institutioB.*- 
is dependent upon the total student ex
perience; that vandalism, for example, may 
be a result of inadequate social outlets. 
(Swank also suggested that the greater 
number of double majors and students 
carrying overloads than in previous years 
may be partly responsible for increas
ed stress.)
Swank plans to test student acceptance 
of a couple of [plans] this spring. 
The social program will be made in accord
ance with student response and Swanks 
desire to keep the opportunity up [for] 
meeting a date. Student suggestions and 
ideas on how to improve campus social op
portunities are welcomed.
Tuition raised again
For the third year in a row, tuition at 
CMU has gone up. According to a memo 
from Edward Schatz, Vice-president for 
Academic Affairs, undergraduate tuition 
will rise to $1,850 per semester and grad
uate tuition to $2,000 per semester, for 
students taking 36 or more units.
For part-time students, tuition will be 
assessed at $39 per unit for undergrad
uates, $42 per unit for MA and DA stu
dents in English and History, and $50 per 
unit for all other graduate students.
This increase brings the total change 
in full-time undergraduate tuition to $400 
per semester since 1975 when the increases 
began. Back then, this tuition was $1,450 
per semester. In the academic year 76-77, 
it was $1550, and in 77-78, $1700.

continued from page 1
He emphasized the importance of the 
support he received from the fraternities. 
In the past, the fraternal block has been 
electing the president. Im the wrong kind 
of Greek, but they elected me anyway. I 
was really surprised to get so much support 
from them. I didnt know I had so many 
friends.
Regarding his upcoming term in office, 
Tumazos stated, Im looking forward to 
doing the things Ive been promising. I 
hope that we can keep the student body 
unified so that we can get things done with 
the administration.
Tumazos has also announced that any
one interested in the positions of Treasurer 
of Student Government, Assistant to the 
President, Chairperson or member of the 
Grievance Committee, and Chairperson or 
member of the Budget Reform Committee 
may leave a note in the Presidents mailbox 
at the Skibo Information Desk. Tumazos 
recommendations for these positions will 
be presented to the Student Senate for 
confirmation at the March 21 meeting. He 
invites all interested students to come 
forward.

Summer job help
by Lennie Matjasko
SARC(Student Alumni Relations Coun
cil) offers the services of a Summer Job 
Bank Committee. According to committee 
co-chairman Mark Bach, the function of 
the committee is to pool together a 
list of available summer jobs for CMU stu
dents with the assistance of CMU alumni. 
Mark stated, Its inherently difficult to 
find summer jobs. The best chances of 
finding them are through contacting 
alumni.
The committee has sent out a survey 
to various companies around the country. 
The survey inquired about summer job 
programs as well as general information 
about the company. The mailing list 
included alumni working for various com
panies and the Placement Office mailing
Congratulations to all 
candidates for a good, clean
campaign.
list. A number of these surveys have been 
returned, and SARC will begin publishing 
a list of possible openings in the TARTAN 
next week.
Besides the survey, the committee has 
planned another job search activity. On 
March 21, they will conduct a jobathon. 
Members of the committee and volunteers 
will call Pittsburgh alunmi in an effort to 
locate summer job opportunities in south
western Pennsylvania. They will also call a 
few prominent CMU alumni throughout 
the country to ask for their assistance.
To determine in which cities CMU stu
dents are most interested in working, the 
committee has gone through the Place
ment Offices index of summer job requests(the blue cards). The most popular 
cities are: Pittsburgh, New York, Phila
delphia, Boston, Baltimore, Washington 
D.C., Cleveland, and Los Angeles. The 
committee plans to locate alumni in each 
of these cities who will bird-dog summer 
jobs in their areas.
Mark emphasized, the SARC office 
has lots of resources for students seeking 
summer jobs. Students may feel free to 
come to the SARC office on the fifth 
floor of Warner Hall at any time to in
quire.
Anyone interested in helping with the 
jobathon may call extension 2060 or con
tact Jim Wolfe or Mark Bach.
English Dept. 
Head appointed
by Linda Aldridge
On March 1, Richard D. Young, wellknown teacher and researcher in rhetoric, 
accepted the position of English Depart
ment Head at CMU. He is currently teach
ing at the University of Michigan and will 
assume his duties here after the end of the 
present term.
Dr. Young received his Ph.D. from the 
University of Michigan. During his time as
teacher there, he has been both professor 
and chair of the Department of Humanities 
in the College of Engineering. Ft was 
through his efforts that the Department of 
Humanities came into existence; he devel
oped the Department of English into the 
broader organization that it is now.
Richard Young is active in state systems 
of education as well as in national organizations. He comes to CMU with a Nation
al Endowment for the Humanities(NEH) 
fellowship in rhetoric, which will apply 
for the next academic year. The fellowship 
is one of fifteen or sixteen such grants 
existing in the country, and it is the only 
NEH fellowship in the field of rhetoric.
Along with Alton Becker and Kenneth 
Pike, Dr. Young has co-authored a text on 
rhetoric and he has also published several 
articles on the subject. He feels that the 
English Department at Carnegie-Mellon 
is suited to producing major work in the 
field, and he will continue his own personal 
research on rhetoric while here.

Wonder 
Woman 
comes to 
CMU
1 Little people
Wonder Butterfly Britta Fahl
by Linda Aldridge
Last week, the kindergarteners from the 
Child Gare Center here at CMU had the op
portunity to do what many adults would 
like to do; they wrote, directed, and acted 
in their own TV show.
The whole project started with the 
children and their teacher, Susan Butler, 
thinking about television. Television is 
a big part of the childrens lives-it is there 
that they find the images they like and do 
not like. Questions arose in their minds 
about how those images became television, 
about their reality. What is it to make a 
TV show? What is acting?
They began their exploration by watch
ing TV without the sound, trying to see 
how much they could understand about 
a program just through the facial expres
sions and body language of the actors and 
actresses. Next, they drew pictures of 
TV shows and wrote their own stories 
to go with them.
After having thought about television 
individually, the fifteen students got to
gether and, as a group, wrote their own 
cooperative TV show, bearing in mind 
that they had to incorporate plot, action, 
drama, suspense, and a sense of conclu
sion into their final product.
The result was the Wonder Woman 
Show. A group of Wonder Womans fol
lowers were playing in a park, and three 
bad guys (Darth Vader, Mean Jelly 
Green, and Scooby) came into the park 
and froze them without reason. Wonder 
Woman came to the rescue, and ended up 
carting the bad guys off to jail. Once that 
was done, she and her followers decided 
to take the villains to the Good Lake, 
where everyone goes to become good. 
The villains were doused in the lake amidst 
chanting. They werp reformed, and the 
show ended.
The students produced the whole show 
with no assistance from adults. They 
designed costumes, decided what make-up 
they wanted to wear, and were responsible 
for remembering their lines and entrances.
After the show was written, the class 
made a visit to the studio in the basement 
of Hunt Library. There, they saw all of 
the equipment necessary to stage and film 
for television. Two video tapes were made 
of the Wonder Woman Show; parents of 
the kindergarteners came to watch.
The first time through, says Marsha 
Poster, Director of the Child Care Center, 
they were really excited-they held them
selves together. The second taping session 
didnt run as smoothly. The students were 
hot and, things sort of fell apart. But 
throughout, Poster says, they were real 
serious about cooperation. These are the 
kids of a technological society. Its nice 
to help them at the beginning of their years 
come to terms with what technology 
is and what it can do.

Inside Washington
The Washington 
party 
circuit
by Frederic Siegel
Although Ive attended more parties on 
Capitol Hill than I can remember, I feel it 
appropiate to finally relay one of my more 
interesting experiences. Parties are a nec
essary evil on the Hill. Politicians general-' 
ly detest them because, besides having to 
wear those fake smiles, they are constantly 
attacked by constituents, adversaries, and 
the numerous lobbyists who frequent the 
Hill. When it comes right down to it, Id 
rather drink at home and skip these damn 
stupid parties, said Norman Lent, Repub
lican from New York. Its a show at these 
political gatherings; everybody puts on a 
big act. I hate these things, but the constit
uents get upset if Im not in photographs 
with the right people.
The last party I attended was in honor 
of Congressman Bill Green, the newest Re
publican on the Hill, who recently stole 
Mayor Ed Kochs seat from now three-time 
loser Bella Abzug. This reception, welcom
ing the new kid on the block, was held in 
the Republican-controlled Capitol Hill 
Club, as opposed to the Rotunda, 
home of the House Democrats. The Capitol 
Hill Gub is elegantly decorated with 
portraits of Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt, 
and Nixon (the latter*s picture is hung 
crookedly above his favorite piano). The 
carpet is plush velvet and the environment 
glows with a certain surprising warmth. 
Though its clientele is limited to Re
publican House or Senate members and 
those staff people wealthy enough to 
waste $100 monthly, I tried earnestly
'njoy myself.
I left my office at about 5:30 and walk
ed across the street; even though 1 do work 
with a Republican, I felt like a fish out of 
water. As 1 said earlier, the Capitol Hill 
Club reeks Republican. Being a liberal 
Democrat, no wonder I felt strange agreeing 
with everything House Minority Leader
Frederic Siegel
John Rhodes or Presidential hopeful, Sena
tor Howard Baker said. I might have push
ed my democratic biases, but how often 
does one get the opportuninty to enjoy pri
vate conversations with such well distin
guished leaders as Howard Baker or Bill 
Brock. The party was typical for the Hill. 
Lots of good food, plenty of booze, and 
numerous compromising young ladies. I, for 
one, met this strikingly attractive secretary 
who seemed to be on more than familiar 
terms with various congressmen. She was 
noticeably impressed by who I work for 
and in the course of our first five minutes 
of conversation, I was introduced to several 
congressmen, talking about such ordinary 
subjects as banjo playing, southpaws, and 
Yankees. Except in private, political talk is 
a definite taboo. Either the congressmen 
became too drunk or too preoccupied with 
press and constituents to bother discussing 
trivial subjects like legislation.
After enjoying my fill of strawberries, 
roast beef, fancy assorted cheese, and li
quor, I strolled around, congratulating Con
gressman Green and his wife, and generally 
conducting myself in a humble way. I cu
riously gazed at the secretaries, listened to 
some of the congressmen and spent 20 min
utes unsuccessfully trying to pick up a 
Cheryl Tiegs look-alike (although I did get 
her phone number).
My boss, Bruce Caputo, understandably 
hates these parties. It took me fifteen min
utes to convince him to go. He claims that 
he didnt come to Washington to go to 
parties or make friends. He prefers the 
atmosphere of Yonkers to the plush sur
roundings of the Capitol Hill Club. The 
Republican leadership that astounded me 
bores Bruce Caputo. If more people ex
press their dislike of these Hill functions, 
perhaps these parties will become ex
tinct.
Alas, the villains are jailed!
Wonder Woman's helpers disarm and capture the fiends. . Rachel Gruberman was very convincing in the role of Wonder Woman.

TARTAN
Concluding
This is the last time I'll have the chance to use this col
umn, so I'm going to drop the editorial we" and talk to 
you personally. There are things on my mind that have been 
bothering me for a long time, ideas /'ve been accumulating 
since the start of my tenure, things Tve been saving up to 
tell you in this last, farewell editorial.
But now that the time has come to write it .. . how 
should / begin?
/ want to say goodbye, of course. / want to say that Tve 
loved being Editor-in-Chief on the TARTAN; that Tve 
learned a great deal about myself and other people; that Ive 
met a lot of interesting (and not-so-interesting) characters; 
that I've discovered a few things about the way people think 
and the way things work; that being E-in-C has been an ex
perience I II never regret having had, no matter how many 
Sunday nights / (and others on the staff) have gone without 
sleep and no matter how many friends the job has caused 
me to lose.
/ want to say this, but / hesitate for fear of sounding friv
olous and sappy. Working on the TARTAN, in any capacity, 
is so fraught with obligation that the fun of it is quickly 
replaced by a numbing realization of responsibility.
But enough of this seriousness! Ive only got about 55 
lines left. / want to share with you some of the astounding 
things I've learned.
I've learned that while Rhodesian students' problems may 
go practically unnoticed at CMU, a tongue-in-cheek discus
sion of the Grill's hamburgers elicits a storm of letters and 
complaints.
Ive learned that an administration that pledges itself to 
excellence and professionalism one day acts in a most un
professional manner the next day, towards its faculty ana 
students, and gets rid of an excellent degree program be
sides.
I've learned that a student body with valid complaints about housing conditions, tuition costs, facilities (or lack of), 
and the abilities of professors to speak English still hesitates, 
for reasons / still can't figure out, to take those complaints 
anywhere or to anybody.
/ prefer not to think about what all this means, right 
now, and / certainly can't come to any one conclusion. / 
would rather think about what Tve learned from students 
through private conversations: that were all concerned 
about the lack of humanness in ourselves; that we all 
worry about putting too much emphasis on our studies and 
not enough on our personal relations; that we might be 
spending four years thinking about and doing the wrong 
things.
But Ann Landers says the first step towards solving a 
problem is recognizing there is one. So / am hopeful. Some
times, she is so wise.
Those who are waiting for words of wisdom or truth 
from this outgoing editor must be disappointed by now, as 
must be those who are hoping I'll itt loose a torrent of in
vective against the people and things that deserve such. 
3ut / cannot be so positive or so negative; the only thing / 
see before us all is a tremendous amount more to be 
learned, a tremendous amount more to be discovered. To 
that end, / urge us all to ask questions, ask questions, ask 
questions. Study, read, ponder, and ask questions. / can't 
help believing we're on the right track (maybe / can be pos
itive)-a student body that appreciates Walt Disney's The 
Sworcf and the Stone has a lot going for it. But then / re
member that these are the same students who care more about hamburgers than Rhodesian students.
So where does this leave us? Where does it leave me, and 
where does it leave my final editorial? Certainly with no 
conclusion. A year of being the TARTAN E-in-C doesn't 
automatically entitle one to be able to come to a conclu
sionnor does four years of college.
/ wish us all luck in that search to find our own conclu
sions. / wish the next TARTAN staff and all TARTAN 
staffs to come luck in their own, special kind of search to 
find conclusions. And I thank the rest of the outgoing staff 
for having helped with this search. Thanks are due, too, to 
the people who have helped me and the TARTAN this year: 
friends, faculty, and members of the administration. May all 
your conclusions be the right ones.
Sherry Siegel 
Editor-in-Chief
Letters
All letters to the Editor must be 
signed. Names will be withheld 
upon request. The TARTAN does 
not print anonymous letters.
Conserving Energy 
Editor:In the past two weeks, we of 
the campus community have dis
covered that conservation of en
ergy is not as hard as we supposed 
it might be. Lighting has been 
drastically cut back with no great 
effort or inconvenience. Natural 
lighting is just as effective as arti
ficial where both are available. In 
addition, the subdued natural 
light makes for a more relaxed 
working environment.
A lowered level of heat merely 
causes us to wear an extra layer of 
clothing, such as a sweater. This is 
no great inconvenience, as the Bri
tish have known for many years. 
Except for incubator rooms, there 
really is no need for the temper
ature to be any more than 68-70 
degrees F. Just throw an extra 
blanket on your bed, and youll 
sleep just as warmly.
While certain essentials, such 
as elevators could be restarted 
after the current coal crisis, there 
is no cause for the university to 
resume its normal operating pow
er load. We have shown that a 
31% power cut- back is easy. A 
continued cut- back of 25% 
should be near painless. Why not 
conserve now, and set an example 
for the community, than squander 
when coal again becomes readily 
available.
Daniel Klein 
Disappointing Folio
Editor:
I would like to express my ex
treme disappointment in the 
March 7th issue of Folio. In the 
past, Folio has been one of the 
best features of the TARTAN. 
Unfortunately, this was not true 
for this issue.
The March 7th Folio was a 
waste of paper and money. I am 
not criticizing the idea of a doit-yourself Folio, rather the way 
in which the idea was executed. I
believe the concept could have 
been promoted more effectively 
in less space.
In last weeks editorial the 
Editor-in-Chief asked students to 
support an increase in the acti
vities fee. Personally, I am in favor 
of this increase because I know 
how much it is needed. But, had I 
based my decision on the last 
issue of the TARTAN, I may have 
come to the opposite conclusion.
Why should I pay more money 
when the TARTAN prints four 
pages of nothing?
I sincerely hope that in the fu
ture the staff of the TARTAN will

Abortion Issue Discussion 
Editor:
When writing in a newspaper 
aimed towards the general popula
tion, one must not delve into his 
subject matter very deeply for fear 
of turning off his readers-the 
majority of whom only wish to 
gain a casual knowledge of current 
events. Julian Singer was limited 
in this way when he wrote his col
umn View from the Campus in 
the TARTAN of March 7. There
fore, I feel that he was wrong in 
writing about the issue of liberal
ized abortion. Arguments such as 
the ones he used, forced as they 
were to be simplistic, are not use
ful in a true debate on the subject 
where one would insist on tight 
logic.
There are many subjects that 
cannot adequately be covered in a 
newspaper. Examples are the ERA 
amendment, U.S. involvement in 
Africa, nuclear power, etc., in 
addition to the abortion issue. A 
university of our stature should 
seriously consider the establish
ment of a journal devoted towards 
issues such as these where power
ful interest groups (lobbies), ex
pedience, or overall difficulty of
subject make it impossible for the 
average person ( who is in the per
plexing situation of having a vote 
but not having the time to do his 
own research) to have an under
standing.
Martin Greenstein
P.S. It was strange to see an article 
pro-abortion next to a letter to 
the Editor sympathizing with baby 
seals. Remember, unemployed seal 
hunters live in slums which 
breed [s] anti-social behavior.
Watermelon Bash Funding
Editor:
During the Senate meeting of 
March 7th, UFOs (United Frater
nal Organization) budget was 
passed by the Senate with $418 of 
student funds allocated for the an
nual Watermellon Bash. We are 
vigorously opposed to this alloca
tion on the grounds that the Water
mellon Bash is a fraternity rush 
event and therefore should not be 
subsidized with public monies.
To rectify this irresponsible ac
tion of Senate, we are circulating 
a petition to restrain the senate 
action and have the issue decided 
by a binding referendum. A copy 
of the petition may be found at
the Skibo Information Desk. We 
are asking you to sign it so that 
a dangerous precedent is not set 
in letting exclusive groups gain 
access to public monies.

Rising Activities Fee 
Editor:
Im writing in response to the 
current debate over the raising of 
the activities fee. It seems that 
there isnt enough money to fund 
all those free dances, Coffee
houses, etc. The answer is obvious 
extort some more money from 
the students, right? After all, thats 
the American way, isnt it? From 
each according to his ability and 
to each according to his need, 
right?
Andrew Carnegie would roll 
over in his grave if he heard that. 
Yet it seems that this is CMUs 
policy. After all, I have to pay for 
those dances and Coffeehouses 
whether I go to them or not.
Wouldnt it be fairer to have 
each person pay for his share of 
an activity when he comes to the
door to partake of that activity? 
That way a worthless activity 
would not support itself, ana 
would be discontinued. Further
more, I would only pay for the 
activities participated inno more 
and no less. Id particularly like 
to see this newspaper being sold 
rather than given away. That way 
when it didnt sell theyd have to 
improve it.
The only way any change will 
take place though is if you all get 
tired of being robbed and start 
screaming to the administration 
about it.
Michael K. Fox
Abortion Issue Discussion 
(part II)
Editor:
The ideas expressed by Julian 
Singer on abortion in the March 7 
issue of the TARTAN lead to some 
interesting possibilities. Those 
who accept abortion do so on the 
premise that the fetus is not really 
alive. This is taken to be true be
cause the fetus is not viable; 
i.e., if it is removed from the pro
tective surroundings of the womb 
it does not survive. Furthermore, 
says Singer, abortion is necessary 
to alleviate serious social and econ
omic problems. In his words, It 
should be societys objective to de
crease the population in the slums, 
not the opposite.
By generalizing Singers ideas 
on abortion, it seems possible that 
societys objective can be achieved 
in the following way. On a chilling 
winter day all the slum-dwellers in 
the Pittsburgh area are to be strip
ped of their clothing and removed 
from their homes. They are then 
to be gathered together outdoors 
in some convenient field. Without 
the protective surroundings of 
clothing and shelter, the slumdwellers are not expected to sur
vive. This is acceptable, for it 
simply confirms that they are not 
viable and, therefore, that they 
were not really alive.
Although this plan is motivated 
by lofty ideals, it is likely that it 
could not be carried out in prac
tice. When subjected to such treat
ment, the slum-dwellers would 
probably protest vehemently. For
tunately, for the good of society , 
the same cannot be said of a fetus. 
It is difficult for someone to pro
test his treatment if he has yet to 
draw his first breath.

The Luck of
by Carole Elm
I'm finishing my second year of hard labor at 
CMU, with no time off for good behavior. What 
luck! If it weren't for bad luck, I'd have no luck 
at all!
I came to the world of CMU as a naive, trusting 
freshman, but to CMU I was money first and a 
number second. . . never a person. Now as a dis
gusted and embittered sophomore number, I re
present more money to CMU. I had the impres
sion that it was the student who wrote home 
asking, Please send money!", but instead it is 
CMU writing home saying, "Please send more

the Scottish
money!" This place is about as personal and as 
feeling as a brick.
I've had the good fortune (?) to use the various 
services around campus, from maintenance to 
work-study to security to Swank and even to 
Cyert. It's "Fill out a form"; "We will try to get 
to you in two weeks"; "We can't do anything 
without his authorization"; "Oh, he's out to 
lunch"; "You don't want to see us, go to them". 
The typical bureaucratic redtape and shuffle. 
These CMU people want the money but not the 
work that goes along with their job. Well, they've 
certainly given me enough to gripe about.
My hissing radiator, after finally getting "fixed", 
gave me a hot lake for two days. The window 
won't close completely; neither will the over
painted doors. The heat was turned off on the 
coldest day last year to install new boilers. This 
year one blows up under me. Security barely rates 
incompetent. Shall I continue?
Classrooms are so cold that one has to take 
notes while wearing gloves. Filth covers the floors 
and hall. The paint on the walls has so much aes
thetic beauty, it hurts. . . olive drab to old bandaid hues. Writing on white chalkboards makes for 
easy reading three rows back, or hasn't CMU heard 
of sponges? First it's sliding along on ice-covered 
sidewalks for weeks; then it's sliding along on piles 
of salt. GSIA gets an addition when the older 
buildings could stand renovations. Shall I go on?
Economics becomes a required course for CIT. 
The semesters are lengthened and the reading days 
before finals are removed. My professor thinks 
women do not make good engineers. Required 
courses are scheduled simultaneously. My depart
ment prefers cutting out students to passing them. 
Then there are the professors who want you to 
devote yourself completely to their course. I 
even had to pay the department for copies of the 
professor's homework answers. Words like sleep, 
TV, food, and darn have been replaced respectively 
with nerd, calculator, soya, and fuck. Shall I 
continue?
Last but not least, there's housing. With the 
overcrowded dorms surely enough money is flow
ing into CMU. Rumor has it that CMU has been 
running in the black. Why the increase? If I could 
see where the money goes I may not mind parting 
with it as much. For 1978-79 the housing increase 
was $140. Centrex costs are 25% of this increase. 
First there was a $22 installation cost. Fine if 
you like phones, but I prefer to talk to people in 
person. Then since every room has a phone (though 
not all are connected), there is no need for CMU 
to pay Ma Bell for the hall phones. All the floor 
phones were removed with no prior notice to 
dorm residents. Ah, but one phone should have 
remained in each tower. So CMU has to pay the 
telephone men again to re-install a phone. WAST
ED TIME AND MONEY! Talk about an under
handed way to get people on Centrex! Now they 
are asking for an additional $35 for Centrex! The 
answer I got to account for this money was that 
Centrex exists for security purposes. All the dorms 
will be locked and visitors will have to call before
hand. Shall I go on?
That's enough bitching. I believe you get my 
message. I'd probably be boring you if I wrote six 
more paragraphs. But that would mean you've 
heard these gripes before. That would mean that 
I wasn't the only one getting the shaft at CMU.
Or.. . is it only me getting all the bad luck?
THE UMW SCREW
The next 8-page FOLIO is coming out on April 
11, and the theme is "Rest and Relaxation at 
CMU." We've extended the deadline for copy 
and artwork for this issue until April 4, in order 
to give everyone enough time to prepare their 
work for submission. What better way to celebrate 
the onset of Springwhen a young student's 
thoughts turn to kites and frisbees and Schenley 
Park and even lovethan by writing about those 
golden relaxing moments here at CMU. After all, 
all work and no play makes for a dull student.

LETTERS
by Mory Brenner 
Dear Editor,
I have been an avid reader of your paper for 
many years now, and have generally respected the 
opinions which you have expressed in your edi
torials, but lately I have become quite disturbed 
by some of the comments which you have made, 
in regard to the problem of the pillage of our 
land by Barbarians. I am specifically referring to 
some of the comments you have made in describina the leader of this movement, "Atilla the 
Hun." In past months you have referred to Atilla 
as a "thief and a barbarian"; these statements are 
now accepted pretty much as fact. When you be
gan to accuse him of being an "asshole and a 
schmuck" I began to be quite upset, yet I did not 
feel that it was my place to say anything. But 
yesterday, when you labelled Atil la "A Big M 
F, I decided that it was time to speak up.
What right do you have to say that about 
Atilla! You do not even know him! Your state
ment contains no truth whatsoever, and no one 
should know better than I. After all, I am his 
mother.
I would just like to point out that Atilla is 
basically a good boy. All right, I will admit that 
he does get a little bit wild with his friends every 
now and then, but he has a good heart. I do apolo
gize to anyone who has been killed by Atilla, but 
you must understand that his father was a very 
bad influence on Atilla. It was his father, "Marvin 
the Hun", who taught him how to steal. It began 
one day when Marvin stole some peas from Atil la's 
plate at dinner. Soon Atilla also learned the trick, 
and was stealing food from the rest of the family. 
It was cute at first; after all, he was only four at 
the time. The problem came about the time he 
was sixteen. He had become such an expert that 
he would steal all of the food from our plates be
fore we even had the chance to eat it. Atilla felt 
very sorry about this, but it had already become a 
habit, and he found it very hard to stop.
By the time Atilla was seventeen, both of his 
sisters had died of starvation, and Marvin and I 
were thoroughly undernourished. That was when 
Marvin asked Atilla to leave the house, and make 
a life for himself.
We parted sadly, although we knew that it 
was best for the family. We had always hoped 
that Atilla would become a doctor, or a lawyer, 
but one thing that we always told him was that 
"he should be the best at whatever he does." It 
took us awhile to accept the fact that Atilla has 
chosen to be a professional barbarian, but now we 
are both very proud of him.
People may hate him, and curse at him, and I 
would like to point out at this time that the "Atilla 
the Hun Joke" fad which is sweeping our land is 
in poor taste, but I still love him and contend that 
he is a good boy. He writes home once a week, 
and visits four or five times each year, which is 
more than I can say for most of the young men of 
our world today. Atilla has done just as we had 
always asked of him; he is the best barbarian in 
the world, and when someone curses him, or in
sults him, I'm proud to stand up and say, "That 
Hun is my son!"
Thank you, 
Mrs. Marvin the Hun 
(Atilla's mom)

Dearest Sirs,
It is not without an admitted bit of trepida
tion that once again I feel compelled to use your 
great newspaper to rant and rave about the miser
able living conditions here at CMU. But this time 
the Letters to the Editor Section is not enough. 
No! If this editorialized diatribe gets printed at 
all, it must be in the FOLIO so that it gets the dig
nified attention it deserves. Since you've handled 
my gripey letters before, you must know that I'm 
the one who raised the ruckus about the swim
ming pool being closed whenever the polo team 
had a game in the main gym. And for that little 
complaint, I was viciously run down one night 
by both members of the CMU polo team on horse
back wielding their wooden mallets. And it was I 
who first brought to the attention of the campus 
community the fact that Servomation vending 
machines did hot carry donuts, that yogurt could 
not be purchased as a side dish in the Kiltie Cafe, 
and that Mellon Institute was and still is too far 
from the main campus (why don't they simply 
move up Forbes and set it on the cutthere's just 
enough room between Skibo and Warner Hall).
But now, with the coal-strike-energy-crisis 
upon us, I have so much to editorialize about that 
I rub my hands with glee just thinking about it. 
Down how many gloomy stairwells have I stumbled 
in the past 2Vi months? How many days now have 
those of us on meal contract been forced to eat 
cold instead of warmed-over leftovers? Here it is, 
the middle of April, more than a month since the
miners retused to return to work under the TaftHartley Act, and Duquesne Power has just order
ed us to cut energy consumption to 30% of norm
al, which can't help but worsen the situation.
I went to Hunt Library yesterday and had a 
terrible time trying to study under the only light 
still left on in the place. A lot of students (in
cluding myself) are even bringing flashlights to 
their classes; they have to if they meet in any of 
those windowless Science Hall rooms. This is 
patently unfair for those of us too poor to af
ford extra batteries, for there-is nothing worse 
than having your light source fail you while you're 
straining to read the blackboard in a darkened 
room. Clocks are another problem. What with the 
rolling blackouts we've been having, many are a 
few hours behind time and none of them are on 
time. I'm constantly forgetting that they're elec
trically operated and hence my sense of time is 
continually out of kilter. Then there was my 
attempt last week to "see" (if you can call it that) 
the Friday night movie. Due to the mandatory 
power cutback, the projector bulb being used 
was so low in wattage that we all had to gather 
way up front just to see light on the screen. But

TARN50Rclu
by Greg Middleman
Despite two feet of snow, a flu epidemic, and 
now an energy crisis, CMU has managed to stay 
open. We applaud the efforts by the administra
tion to keep CMU open in the wake of disaster.
President Cyert decided that classes would con
tinue at CMU despite a state of emergency, haz
ardous driving conditions, and a 50% absentee 
rate on the day it snowed a foot in January.
Again, President Cyert continued to keep 
school open in February when most of the stu
dent body had the flu. And he has repeated this 
action during the energy crisis. Students will be 
able to attend classes through increased energy 
conservation.
As unpopular as this may sound, President 
Cyert acted properly on all three occasions. Most 
students would have preferred extra vacation
time. When the state of emergency was declared 
during the January blizzard, the school day was 
half-over; faculty that had shown up at work 
would remain anyway, and most students do live 
on or near campus so they could get to class. 
Again in February the administration made the 
right decision. Faculty complied with an administrational request for lenience with flu victims. 
School continued and learning was made possible, 
though assignments and tests were put off. Fin
ally, we feel the administration has handled the 
energy crisis properly. As long as cutbacks in 
auxiliary use of power are possible, classes should 
go on. By giving in and closing school, not only 
does the administration cut off the learning pro
cess, but it also sets a poor example for the com
munity. Besides, we don't know how long the 
coal strike will last, and we may really have to 
shut down later, so we might as well go as long 
as we possibly can and have as much class time 
as time allows.
Students complain about the high tuition cost. 
But do they see how far the administration will 
go to see that students get their money's worth 
by getting the maximum class time possible?
by Stuart Seidman
The country has entered a serious state of emer
gency with the longest strike in the history of 
the UMW. The electric utilities are running out of 
coal at an alarming rate and industries all over the 
landscape are closing due to the lack of power. 
Within hours the mines of the Bitumious Coal 
Mine Association will belong to the federal govern
ment for the third time in the last 35 years.
So what has Carnegie-Mellon done about this? 
The university proudly hails that they have cut 
back beyond the requested 75% level to an out
standing 69%. But first let's examine this. The base 
period to determine the cutback is from early 
last fall when the university was using artificially 
high levels of electricity making it easier for them 
to now meet the cutback orders from Duquesne 
Light Company and the Pennsylvania Public 
Utilities Commission. At any time the university 
will be receiving orders for an additional cutback 
in their consumption of electricity.
Over two weeks ago Governor Milton Shapp of 
Pennsylvania declared a state of emergency in 
Pennsylvania. But what has CMU done to assist in 
this state of emergency? They have cut back an 
amazing 31% in electricity consumption while 
laughing because the administration knows it is 
only about 15%.
Next Friday the university is scheduled to begin 
its spring recess. A patriotic and sensible thing to 
do at this time would be for the administration to 
assist the Pittsburgh region by closing the school 
at the end of this week and keep the university 
closed until the coal is again coming from the 
mines sometime in April. If things go smoothly for 
the federal government we should be back in time 
to prepare for Spring Carnival. It would probably 
be necessary to cancel the Sweepstakes as with no 
students on campus for three weeks it would be
come difficult to schedule the three freerolls but 
the fraternities have come through in the past.
The nation is in the grips of an energy crises 
many times the magnitude of the Arab oil embargo. 
Come on, CMU, do your part!

Dear Editor:
As you know, the students of CMU as well as 
the young adults of the Pittsburgh area have re
cently taken ill as a result of the Russian Flu. Yes, 
this massive outbreak of illness has officially been 
identified as the Russian Flu. Now what most 
people don't know, and I wish to point out, is 
that this is not some new strain of flu sweeping 
the country but a pre-Communist invasion plot. 
Those Commies over there have developed a way 
to miniaturize themselves so they may attack us 
unnoticed. It's not the flu that we've been suffer
ing from, but a bunch of miniature Russians at
tacking our bodies.
This has been planned for many years over in 
Russia as a means to destroy their biggest threat 
toward world domination. Yes, I mean the elim
ination of the American youth, the fighting force 
of our country. So if we don't act now, if we 
don't strike them before they get us again, it'll be 
all overno more baseball, hotdogs, apple pie, or 
Skibo buns. So let's get out there and blow them 
Commies back to where they came from!

> Project: FAT
by Kevin Q. Brown
One of the first major successes came with the 
advent of the television. Unlike radio, which only 
requires a person to remain within earshot of the 
source, television requires the viewer to remain in 
^ a restricted line-of-sight orientation to the tube 
and, preferably, in a rigid stancemind and body 
glued to the demands of this device. Within just a 
few years, television has captured the soul of 
many an innocent, transforming lively young hu
man beings into sessile beasts.
But the forces of evil are not content. Television 
is not enough. There must be more plans, more 
methods, more devices for sickening the heart 
\ and atrophying the mind. Thus, Project FAT 
was born and the first target: WMU. Yes, our 
very own Water-Mellon University, that top-flight, 
up right, hard to fight giant of academia is the 
pilot project of the insidious Project FAT.
The first objective of FAT is to quadruple the 
average daily intake of high caloric foodstuffs. 
Thus, Inertia was created, that most essential con, venience store which proudly displays its motto, 
We specialize in junk food! And AutoServo 
makes the scene: utilizing a glittering display of 
semiautomatic 1930s technology remote stations, 
they accost the students of WMU with a bomboardment of sweets, candies, ice cream, and soft 
drinks. And let us not forget the brothers of Fat
willing women a bubbling gallon of brew for 
breakfast.
But the cleverest scheme yet is provided cour
tesy of the big boys at Food Service. Of course 
there is the expected assortment of pies and ice 
cream in 17 eye-popping flavors, but that's not 
the feal^of genius of which I speak. This brilliant 
Food Service Prime Plan comes in two flavors 
the Morbid Gardens plan and Skoobi plan. At 
Morbid Gardens the unsuspecting student is led
to participate in the ritual of unlimited seconds, 
stuffing and gorging his/her helpless body with 
mountainous tons of foodstuffs heaped high on 
the tray. Then at Skoobi, in the Kitty Kafe, the 
8 (or 9) point plan claims its victims. They wad
dle through the lines, their pudgy hands grasping 
morsel after morsel, minds intent only on getting 
their full share. After all, I paid for it,didn't I?" 
explained one terminal case.
Yet this is not all! Project FAT strikes on two 
fronts. Not only is the defenseless student cram
med with countless calories but he/she is also 
restrained so that all those megacalories convert 
to fat. This is, of course, obviously the intent of 
the many movies shown at WMU, but it is most 
evident in the evil policy of the athletic depart
ment. The powers-that-be at the athletic depart
ment have decreed that the spectator sports are 
to have the highest priority because for the price 
of only a few people getting adequate exercise, 
an entire crowd has to sit on its collective ass, 
munching on popcorn and soda throughout the 
entire game. Furthermore, in an act of vicious 
thoroughness, those slimy toads have insured 
that all other activities in the gym at the time of 
a spectator sport are forcibly cancelled. This is a 
crucially necessary measure because it certainly 
wouldn't be effective to kick Joe Student off the 
basketball court for a varsity game if he could 
simply roll down to the pool and get his full 
quota of exercise there.
What's in store for the future? The details are 
uncertain, but this much is for sure: all are going 
to become, if not better, then at least bigger.

WAS MY VALLEY
OR
A WALK IN
THE COUNTRY
by Jeffrey Zas/ow
I'm sick and tired of reading editorials that 
make no sense. These editorials begin by making 
one point, and end by making another point, 
which is often completely unrelated to the hur
ricane incident at all. How can the supposed 
editorial-writers of the world stray so far from 
their intended topic so easily? I doubt that there's 
much chance of the freeway going through the 
residential neighborhood without the approval of 
the residents who live there now. The seals of the 
world are being killed, and we know it. But what 
do we know, and what do we leave to intuition?
And does it matter? If the energy crisis would 
revert back to the early days, when the creed of 
the Disney exhibit at the New York World's 
Fair read, "It's a small, small world", . . . then 
what? We're all lost by this point and there's 
no way out except to clean up the city streets, 
and to put the people on welfare to work. Is this 
any excuse for high housing rates?
What's the use in sending a man to the moon if 
there's no way to feel the earth's vibrations with
out putting your ear to the ground? Could it be 
that it's all so simple now? Or has time rewritten 
every line? If we had the chance to do it all again 
. . . could we? Would we? I doubt that Congress 
would dare pass the resolution. I think that the 
response from the consumer would prohibit 
smoking in Room 2210 during movies. So why do 
we act like animals during movies when we should 
be acting like humans? There is a difference, or 
don't you think that women should have the right 
to vote?
The fact of the matter is that the internal com
bustion engine and the subject of this editorial go 
hand in hand with the hands of the retarded. So 
why wash your hands after a hard day of work in 
the garden? Why wash your face? Why shower?
No one ever vomits unless they've had too much 
to drink or unless they're sick. Face it, he's the 
candidate that merits our unyielding and un
inspired support.
For how does the World Trade Center help the 
world trade? Or does the World Trade Center 
trade worlds? Either way, there's no way that the 
Indians will give us the land without the crusades 
starting up again. And that's why Charles Manson 
should be free to roam the streets. His freedom 
will mean more jobs for the average American, 
and I'm against making this glorious country a 
welfare state. I'm against making it any kind of 
state. I think the U.S. should be left as a country.
I can't emphasize it enough. I won't emphasize 
it enough. I'm finished with my emphasis and I 
plan to start a league for underpriviledged chil
dren of divorced homosexuals. It's the right thing 
to do. It's the best thing to do given the circum
stances. The evidence is much too strong. The
seals in the Atlantic are being wiped out by the 
Russian fishing boats at the rate of 434 kilo
meters every third day. Can we afford to let this 
injustice continue to the point of race riots simi
lar to the scale exhibited in Harlem and Watts in 
the 1960s? I shudder to think. I think when I 
shudder. Usually I think to myself, "Now I'm 
going to shudder." My brain is connected to my 
nerve cells. My hip bone is connected to my cal
culator. It's a problem that has to be solved.
Lastly I'm beat. I'm bushed. I'm proud to be 
Ukranian, and I think that Ukranian jokes 
should be outlawed. Would you want him to 
represent your family in Student Senate? I tend 
to doubt whatever the world tends to doubt. My > 
own opinion is that Lee Harvey Oswald was 
framed.

THE ART OF 
SUPERFLUITY IN WRITING
ON BEING 
HUMAN...
Finally, when you have established yourself in 
the upper hierarchy, adorn your office with a 
touch of the grandiose. Pretentiousness is also 
easily accomplished with an extravagant use of 
words. When you make a decision, call it an "his
toric decision" made on "this momentous occa
sion." Of course admitting to an "historic blunder" 
would be considered a faux pas. Throughout your 
speeches, weave a profundity of slogans, short 
fabricated phrases to stimulate the emotion"My 
country right or wrong!" Always remember to 
impress people with how you say something rather 
than with what you have to say.
If it turns out that you are totally incompetent 
at mastering either of these two styles, you will, 
unfortunately, have to rely on plain simple speech. 
There is no art involved in this, of course, since all 
you are doing is expressing your thoughts concisely 
and in understandable words. You are just making 
the words do what they are intended to do which 
defies all the rules for writing in a superfluous 
form. Understandably, a lot of time and effort 
(especially a good thesaurus) is needed to become 
skilled at the art of superfluity in your writing, 
but such is the price of fame!
Frederic J. La Pointe
It seems that being human isn't enough any
more. And at this place you even have to prove 
that sometimes. Most everyone here has set a de
finitive, although arbitrary, standard for the com
pany they will allow. On too many occasions I 
have seen people "disallowed," even if only be
cause of appearance or impression. It is not a 
pleasing sight. Each individual may have a unique 
set of criteria, but if you don't "qualify" then 
you're something less than a personit seems that 
nothing you can possibly have to offer can be of 
any worth. To the antagonist involved you have 
just been written off as being sub standard, since 
being just a person isn't enough. Noyou have to 
be attractive, or studious, or creative, or chic, 
or whatever. So someone you probably don't 
even know has "de humanized" you and you'll 
feel unwelcome wherever you're seen, even if 
you're with mutual friends.
All this may sound like the exception, but I 
have seen that it is not by any means. Nor can 
any one group of people be singled out above all 
others as being responsiblein fact, that is really 
the problem; it is all so widespread. To see people 
treat others without any ''^-sideration whatsoever-to the point where their worth as people is 
apparently negatedis a shamefully absolute dis
grace and definitely something that needs to be 
purged. Only one suggestion can be made that 
would be hopefully effectiveto hold in mind 
that every single human being has something of 
value to offer to every other, even if it is simply 
that they are also human.
ENERGY
ALTERNATIVE
by Neil Bloomberg
The simple declarative sentence can be quite an 
effective tool in attaining a favorable degree of 
success and eminence within academic institut
ions of higher learning when wielded properly by 
a skilled prolix, yet sagacious, artisan. The aucourant, parlous philogist in his illustrious practice of 
chirography, armed only with the bare dissertate, 
a comprehensive lexicon of syntactical and ety
mological reference and a bulk of usuable voguish 
vocabulary, can impart to the reader of his lucu
brations that he has an infinite arcanum of any 
topic he wishes to excogitate. Consequently the 
puerile reader is irrefragably dumbfounded by the 
ostentatiousness of the overbearing, jejune usury 
of verbiage.
In other words, use words to impress or bewild
er rather than to inform. This technique of super
fluity in your writing gives the reader only a vague 
idea of what you are talking about; however the 
reader will believe you to be an accredited author
ity on any subject since the vocabulary is way 
over his head. To paraphrase, the reader thinks 
that you know what you are saying, mainly be
cause the reader knows that he does not know 
what you are talking about. Mastering this art is 
an absolute necessity if you want to become an 
intellectual snob.
If writing in this superfluous form is too diffi
cult, there is another successful method known as 
"gobbledygook." With "gobbledygook" you take 
well known, fairly big words and incorporate 
them into one bombastic,unintelligible sentence. 
For example look at these innocent words: "real
istic," "discrimination," "dynamic," "academic," 
and "economic." You must admit that they are 
fairly harmless in their present form. But with a 
little imagination you can put them together in 
one sentence and create gobbledygook! "Our 
local realistic policy of economic discrimination 
inadvertently transfers the issue as to the adminis
trative instability of an academic complexity fac
ing dynamic maladjustments." With gobbledy
gook, words are used as a form of non-communi
cation. This technique of superfluity will work 
quite well for people who write science and his
tory texts, students' term papers, business stock 
reports, contracts, tax forms, political writings, 
laws, and especially for any ambitious politician 
who wants to say something without saying any
thing.
This style has many advantages. First of all, 
you can use words to cover-up rather than dis
close the truth: poverty does not exist because 
there are only "low-income" groups. Rather than 
slums there are "underdeveloped inner cities." 
Slaughtering masses of people appears as "the re
moval of political opposition" or "the elimination 
of fractious elements." Total mastery of the gob
bledygook technique is vital if you intend to be a 
political propogandist. Secondly, words can ac
tually create reality. Consider that a problem often 
exists labelling reality. Is the economy in a "re
cession" or "depression"? Is there "peace" or 
something called "detente"? Is there a "war" 
or only a "conflict" going on? Is that "art" or 
"smut"? With a good grasp of this concept, you 
can use a plethora of vocabulary to your advan
tage. Know the end you wish to achieve and then 
carefully use words to define that endthere is an 
energy "crisis"!

I'm within 30 feet of their antenna, I can just

I've taken these complaints to the appropriate 
campus authorities but to little avail. They all ask 
me for constructive suggestions in view of the 
crisis situation and I keep replying that I have 
none. Of course I have none! All I'm interested in 
doing is complaininglet the authorities do the 
constructive suggesting. It seems to me we have a 
human energy shortage in this country: people 
are too lazy or afraid to stand up and bitch!
I only hope this long-winded editorialization will

President Cyert announced today that the 97% 
cutback in power by Duquesne Power Company 
and West Penn Power will have no effect on the 
closing of classes at Carnegie-Mellon University. 
This seems quite amazing since the 112 day old 
coal strike has dwindled coal supplies to only ten 
more minutes left of fuel.
In a news conference held yesterday, President 
Cyert urged fellow universities to follow CMU's 
example of keeping classes open. When asked how 
he intends to do this amazing task while the rest of 
the country remains in a state of paralysis, Cyert 
commented, "At the present state of technology 
it is possible to build a small electrical generating 
device. If produced in sufficient quantities, enough power could be generated to keep an entire 
campus community functional over a long period 
of time."
On CMU's third floor Science Hall, where once 
stood a multitude of complex computers, now rest 
the hundreds of mini hand generators used to keep 
CMU alive and functional. SCH3000 has become 
a place where students on work study and aca
demic probation can sit back and relax as they 
turn their hand generators in a slow rhythmic mo
tion while listening to their favorite radio station, 
WPGH.

joyment and the Film Committee wants you to share the experience 
with us ... Thursday, March 16, at 6, 8 and 10 in DH 2210.
The film has had a limited public screening; but it swept the box 
offices wher ever it went. . .especially in Chicago. Say "Allegro Non 
Troppo" to a friend from the Windy City and see what happens! You 
will find the public agreeing with the critics: it has the best animation 
in the past 10 years.
Allegro Non Troppo, the movie for the head set. Bozetto hosts 
Debussey, Vivaldi, Debussey, Sravinsky, Dvorak, Ravel and Sibelius, 
in his film
Playboy says "Bozetto has a go at everything from Debussey s Af
ternoon of a Faun' (in which an aged, lusting faun dodders across 
voluptuous landscapes where real live girls no longer give him a 
second glance) and Ravel's Bolero' (the story of evolution, no less, 
brilliantly depicting the origin of the species as a long march from 
there to eternity that begins with the seminal drop of matter in a Coke 
bottle) to Vivaldi's Concerto in C' (as experienced by a honeybee on a 
picnic before he's rudely interrupted by a passionate human couple 
enjoying a quickie in the grass)."
Allegro Non Troppo, an animated medley of satire, surrealism, 
spoofery, and general nonsense. Bozzetto cuts back throughout the 
film to a group of live actors, who act out the plight of the animator in 
outrageous, slap-stick comedy.
ALLEGRO NON TROPPO . . . don't let the name fool you . . . and dont 
miss it... Thursday, March 16, at 6, 8, 10 in DH 2210.

Brooks parodies Hitchcock
A movie review 
Movie: High Anxiety 
Director: Mel Brooks
by John Morris
The premise of Mel Brooks latest par
ody, High Anxiety, seems to be that if you 
choose a respectable enough subject to 
camp, the short cuts and half-baked ideas 
of the effort wont be noticed. At least 
this is how it seemed to me as I viewed this 
tribute to Alfred Hitchcocks films.
Starring, co-authored, directed and pro
duced by Brooks, High Anxiety also fea
tures Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman 
and Madeline Kalin, veterans of previous 
Brooks blockbusters. This time the humor 
falls flat, and the reason is that Brooks 
laugh machine only functions when its 
aping a genre which takes itself with utter 
seriousness, like the western of Brooks 
Blazing Saddles. I always considered Hitch
cocks films immensely funny, but in a 
droll sort of way. The irreverent comic 
treatment by Brooks of Hitler in The Pro
ducers was a success because the topic was 
^>ff limits, but the elementary school bath
room humor of High Anxiety is presump
tuous because Hitchcock has already 
camped himself on many occasions, and in 
a more sophisticated fashion.
Still, High Anxiety should have every
thing going for it-well almost everything, 
for Gene Wilder, a performer whose abili
ties seem tailor-made for Brooks concepts, 
is sadly absent from this picture. The idea 
of a group of mentally disturbed psychia
trists running a cliffside California mental 
hospital is not without its possibilities, and 
such a formidable comedic cast should be 
able to carry almost anything off. Many of 
the same San Francisco locations from 
Vertigo are used, but it somehow isnt the 
same. This is because Brooks in general 
avoids the comedic opportunities of
Hitchcocks stylistic traits, except on the 
most superficial level. The come-on is 
Hitchcock, but the filler of the film is pure 
Mel Brooks.
The gags range from clever to stomachturning. In the Psycho tradition, an attack 
occurs in a hotel room shower stall a 
flogging with a rolled up newspaper. I had 
to laugh when the soggy newsprint ink 
dribbled down the drain. Less cute was

A music review 
Event: Greek Sing 
Producer: United Fraternal 
Organization
by Russ Militello
After three years at school I guess it's 
about time that I experienced Greek Sing. 
After all, everyone likes to try something 
new now and then. 1 admit that I was a bit 
skeptical. Thoughts ran through my head. 
These are people that I see in classes every 
day. These are the kids from Mrs. ONans 
economics class who know all about supply 
and demand. . . but can they sing? It was 
hard for an inexperienced person like me 
to imagine it. Is figured Id give it a try. 
What did I have to lose? Finally the time 
came and the first group came on stage. (I 
know her!) Its funny how seeing people 
you know on stage can make you feel good.
I was at ease. Phi Kaps and Thetas led the 
way with a medley of popular hits With a 
Little Help from my Friends, What I did 
for Love and Knowing Me, Knowing You. 
The blend of voices was surprising. The 
guys didnt overpower the girls at all. 
Sure, I could have done without the con
trived gestures in spots but they functioned 
well as a group and were very entertaining.
Next came Pika with a medley of hits 
from the 50*s, complete with greaser cos
tumes. I didnt think they could carry it 
off. Its been done so often. But they knew 
what they were doing. From Remember 
When to Rock and Roll is Here to Stay the 
50*s was there before my eyes. The soloist 
was something else. He made the picture 
complete.
The Pi Lams singing PDQ Bachs Jane,
My Jane and a medley of CMU songs was 
an interesting and different idea at least to 
me. The CMU songs were very good. Who
ever wrote them demonstrated a great deal 
of creativity and imagination. Songs were 
performed to the tune of Love is Blue a 
ballad of the Russian flu; Mr. Ed*s Theme 
fared nicely as a satire of the music ed. 
American Pie found itself with the new 
words Bye-bye Morewood Gardens Byebye* and warned everyone of the perils of 
living in that building.
Kappa Sigma was next and was brave 
enough to attempt the stilted songs of The 
Student Prince. These songs are not easily 
adaptable. However, they sounded good as 
a unit. The choreography left something to 
be desired, but the march and regimental 
movements were quite good.
Next came the sisters of Delta Gamma 
with selections from Company. The voices 
were smooth and sweet and they made ex
cellent use of lighting and stage position. 
They also had a very nice duet with two 
very good voices.
Chi Omega was next. Dressed as orphan
ed waifs, they sang selections from Annie. 
As they pranced around the stage they 
captured the child-like theme of the show. 
The song You*re not Fully Dressed with
out a Smile was great. It showed imagina
tive choreography, nice vocal blend and 
they were having fun!
The Tri-Delta sisters opened the second 
half with selections from Cinderella. They 
were all dressed in formal gowns and looked 
somewhat inhibited. Their voices were very 
pleasing.
Next the brothers of ZBT sang selections 
from West Side Story. The costumes were 
subtler than those of PKA but they still 
managed to keep the tough guy** image.
Although they sang better when they were 
stationary than when they were moving, 
the image wasnt entirely lost.
Now it was back to the mixed group with 
ATO and KKG with songs from Pippin. 
The guys had smooth but powerful voices 
that mixed well with the girls. This wasnt 
one of the livelier groups, but they had 
some strong choreography that made good 
pictures on the stage for a very enjoyable 
group performance.
Guys and Dolls was the selection by 
SAE and even though there were parts 
lost in the beginning due to poorly placed 
microphones^ I managed to hear some ex
cellent voices. The singing was superb, the 
harmony and blend were outstanding. And
the choreography was even better. These guys obviously worked very hard. They
put on a very professional show.
DU continued the program with a Gersh
win medley. The three songs that they per
formed were all quite good and enhanced 
by snappy choreography, but I particularly 
liked the solo rendition of Summertime. 
The solist handled this particularly difficult 
song very well. As a group they showed a 
sensitive handling of the music and lyrics 
which is difficult to do with Gershwin.
Closing the evening was a performance 
by the brothers of BTP. They sang selec
tions from Man of LaMancha, troubador 
style with guitar accompaniment. There 
were only nine members on stage so voices 
were often lost. The song Dulcinea was 
particularly well done and sensitively hand
led.
Thus ended the Greek Sing. There were 
some surprises, pleasant and unpleasant,but 
mostly I was impressed by the amount of 
team work and spirit that goes into a pro
duction of this magnitude and importance. 
I*ve made my judgments about who will 
win, but thai s not really the important 
issue. This event raised money for the 
Easter Seals campaign and the Greeks had 
fun performing, plus the audience had a 
good time watching.
shocking children in,the conventions aud
ience. The low point of the film came for 
me when Brooks is attacked in a park by a 
flock of defacating birds. Maybe such anal 
expulsive funnies put you in stitches, but 
its not my cup of expresso. At this point, 
when Brooks* bag of tricks seemed nearly 
empty, he harkened back to that old reli
able, elderly married couple with Jewish 
accents bickering in public number. 
It was tired.
Painfully miscast is Madeline Kahn, do
ing a lackluster Tippi Hetfrin imitation. 
Better she should stick to televisions 
Comedy Tonight, where her mannerisms 
are more appropriate. Likewise, the title 
song, composed by sound track veteran 
John Morris, seemed to be a not very imag
inative reshuffling of the tune of that Perry 
Como hit, Its Impossible. The only thing 
distantly akin to suspense was trying to 
stay awake for Cloris Leachmans next 
appearance, that nearly saves this picture. 
Her creation of the sadistic Nurse Diesel is 
a tour de force, and in the long run per
haps the best summation of the picture 
comes with her delivery of this line, totally 
unexpected and spontaneous. It sucks'**
Greek Sing 
results
by Joan Livitski
Though winning isnt always everything, 
the awards ceremony Saturday night proved 
that at least to some Greeks it meant a great 
deal. By midnight, the overly anxious, (and 
in some cases overly drunk), crowd started 
to give their fraternal chants in competitive 
unison. The next time anyone says theres 
too much student apathy, they should 
attend Greek Swing (except that its closed 
to anyone outside the Greek society.)
Students crowded the stage, stood on 
chairs and tables, and climbed on peoples 
shoulders all to hear the results of last 
nights performance. Each group must have 
had hopes of leaving with one of the cov
eted trophies, and yet, not everyone can be 
a winner.
This years winners in the mixed group 
category were: first place: Alpha Tau 
Omega and Kappa Kappa Gamma, second 
place: Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa Alpha 
Theta. For sororities, Chi Omega walked 
off with first place, leaving second to 
Delta Delta Delta. But the most suspense 
seemed weighed upon who would walk off 
with the trophies for the best fraternal or
ganizations performance. First was awarded 
to Sigma Alpha Epsilon, followed in se
cond place by Pi Kappa Alpha and last but 
certainly not least went to Delta Epsilon.

PLTpresents clowns
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre will pre
sent The Tricycle, by Fernando Arrabal, 
Fridays through Sundays, March 17 to April 23, at 8:30 PM.
The Tricycle, subtitled a bizarre clown 
show,** is an unusual combination of commedia dellarte and nightmarish surrealism. 
The story concerns four hoboes whose 
main preoccupations are sleeping, talking 
and kissing. Their childlike fantasy world is 
ultimately shattered after they commit a 
violent murder, which they rationalize as 
an heroic act.
Arrabal claims the play was written in 
homage to Red Skelton and his famous 
Freddie-the Freeloader** character. Like 
Skelton, Arrabal projects the innocence 
and naivety of a child in an adult world, 
while achieving an effect that is intensely 
tragicomic and profound.
Considered one of the most original 
new writers of the European avant-garde, 
Arrabal was bom in Spain but was exiled
from his homeland by the Franco regime in 
1965. At about the same time, Arrabal was 
also excommunicated from the Catholic 
Church for supposed outrageous public 
behavior. His dramatic work deeply re
flects these two experiences of living under 
Franco and the Spanish Church. While his 
plays possess a sense of childish playful
ness, they inevitably turn violent and sadis
tic, as tyranny and oppresion of both 
church and state ruthlessly overcome gen
tility and simplicity.
Often compared with the films of Chalie Chaplin and the surrealist painting of 
Salvador Dali, ArrabaTs theatre, by its very 
nature, is bound to stir controversy.
Conceived and directed by Bill Royston, the production will feature Trish 
Beatty, Robin Grattan, David Miller and 
Harry Cohen in the four major roles. Pitts
burgh Laboratory Theatre is located at 
3300 Fifth Avenue (comer of Fifth and 
Craft), Oakland. Seating is limited, and ad
vance reservations should be made by call
ing 621-2876. _______________________
Rogers high-steps it
Ginger Rogers will appear with special 
guest Myron Cohen, Americas foremost 
storyteller, at Heinz Hall for one perfor
mance only on March 13, 14, and 15 at 
8:00 PM.
The star of some 73 films, Rogers is 
presently touring across the country as 
a nightclub performer. Rogers first star
ring role on Broadway was in George and 
Ira Gershwins Girl Crazy. Her two hit 
songs from that show, Embraceable You 
and But Not for Me, have become musical 
standards.
At the close of Girl Crazy on Broadway, 
Rogers relocated to Hollywood and some 
15 films later joined Fred Astaire in Flying 
Down to Rio. The new team took the 
world by storm and subsequently made 
nine more pictures together.
In addition to her films with Astaire, 
Rogers also starred in a variety of comedies
and dramas with such leading men as Cary 
Grant, Henry Fonda, Dick Powell and 
James Stewart. In 1940, she won the 
coveted Academy Award for her role in 
Kitty Foyle.
Ginger Rogers. .shes adoring and 
amazing and in top hat and tails, kicking 
those lovely legs at you, she can act like 
24, heralded the New York Post.
Other New York critics exclaimed, 
Ginger Rogers opening night at the 
Waldorf with a brand new show was the 
most exciting, glamorous night this famed 
room has witnessed in a lot of years. 
Onna White, one of the great choreo" 
graphers (and she has an Oscar to prove it) 
staged Gingers act, and utilized senti 
mental yesterday with today. Believe me, 
theres nothing old hat about this act.
Tickets to see this perfomance are 
$9.50, $8.50, and $7.50 at Heinz Hall.
Designing by three
by Jonn Goodman
Its not that Claudia Clay, Kim Kraeuter 
and Meryl Greene have anything against 
Art. But theyre Designers, and in their 
show, which opens tonight, thats where 
the emphasis lies.
Theres more to Design than just the 
final product, says Claudia. And while 
theres nothing wrong with just hanging 
portfolio work on the Gallery walls, we felt 
it would be more appropriate if we used 
our show to explain the design process. 
Consequently, the exhibits will illustrate 
their work at three levels of development: 
the initial analysis of the problem, the sub
sequent development of ideas, and the final 
realization of a solution. We have sketches 
showing the progress of our work through 
each of these three steps, says Kim. 
Weve taken about fifteen pieces of our 
work and traced the development of each 
one from beginning to end.
The work on exhibit will include graph
ics of all sorts posters, calendars, and pack
age designs, photography, calligraphy, and, 
as a special added attraction for tonights 
opening, animation.
Meryl has put together a short animated 
film which continues the theme of three. 
Its called Counting by Threeshe ex
plains, and it features the three bears, the 
three stooges, three men in a tub, the three 
see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil mon
keys, the three astronauts, mom, apple pie 
and baseball, and a lot of other memorable 
threesomes. The film will be shown 
throughout the evening in the Gallery Plus, 
as a part of the opening night festivities.
For the remainder of the week, however, 
only selected drawings from the film will 
be on exhibit.
Its interesting to see how the three de
signers have treated their Gallery show as 
a design project. Both the animation and 
the delineation of the designi process are 1  
responses to their analysis of the exhibi
tion problem. The show is distinguished by 
this conscientious realization of a didactic 
as well as aesthetic presentation. It is an 
excellent opportunity to gain some under
standing of what Design is all about, while 
nonetheless enjoying the designers final 
achievements.______________________

Poets educate their audience
A poetry review 
Poets: Barbara Howes and 
Stanley Burnshaw 
I Producer international Poetry 
Forum
by Joan Livitski
The International Poetry Forum 
brought together two diverse poets for an 
informative as well as entertaining pro^ gram. Instead of just giving a reading, each 
poet tried to educate their audience. The 
learning experience was not only enlight
ening but highly enjoyable.
Barbara Howes opened the program, 
gearing her reading to support her theories 
of how poetry is written. Also an author of 
short stories, I got the impression that 
she would be more suited to keeping her 
i work mainly in prose. Not only were her 
introductions overly elaborate, but she 
lacked the direct and precise handle on 
language that I believe is a poets most 
valuable tool.
Having read two of her books, I realized
I enjoyed her poems more on a printed 
page than from her dissertation. This made 
me go back and analyze them more closely, 
bringing me to the realization that, though 
the basic ideas were insightful, her use of 
imagery was weak, often unpointed.
Even though I found her uninspiring as 
a reader, I was highly impressed with the 
knowledge she had of her craft. Choosing 
poems to exemplify her points, Ms. Howes 
continued to show how .. observations, 
inspiration, factual news items, environ
ment and places, rhythm, feelings, politics, 
people, language, and comparison/contrast 
can all be springboards for poems. Just to 
have the benefit of her experience and 
knowledge, especially for those times when 
writers block strikes, was enough reason 
for consciously focusing my attention 
whenever it started to siray.
Barbara Howes made a good teacher in 
that she stated, clarified and expounded on 
each idea. However, several of the poems 
she chose as support lacked a direct cor
relation. The connection may well have 
been within the lines, but it wasnt always 
evident.
When Stanley Burnshaw came on for
the second half of the program, he over
took the show, quickly surpassing the per
formance displayed by Ms. Howes. Not 
only is he a dynamic reader, but his poetry 
is moving in its own right.
I recall reading Coleman Barks*, another 
contemporary poet, comments on his own 
work that he was after  bodily response to 
images in his poems. Well, its my belief 
that Mr. Barks has far to go in reaching 
his desired return, but Stanley Bunshaw 
possesses that ability to send an excited 
shiver through you. And thats just what he 
did at his reading with his images given 
ultimate life until they were able to reach 
out and touch the audience in more ways 
than one.
Most obvious examples of this trait are 
in his Creature Poems, showing humans 
at one with the world, having primitive 
feelings. Though the feelings are base, the 
poems are anything but. Mr. Burnshaw 
displays adaptability as he integrates the 
carefree, easily understandable nature of 
the down-to-earth man of the street, with 
the awe-striking wisdom of the perennial 
scholar. This contrasted to the utmost Ms. 
Howds prim and proper Bostonian finish
ing school style.
fve got Pa
The duality expressed by Stanley Bumshaw resounds over and over in his 
character as well as his work. He is able to 
stir the spirit both by dealing with reality, 
the things which everyone has felt, in a 
refreshing and unique way, and at the 
other end of the spectrum, by looking for 
and utilizing the insightful to stir the 
spirit of his readers. This is also supportive 
of his statement that one  can never read 
the same poem the same way twice.
Here could be the key to his dynamics. 
Ms. Howes seemed to be reading out of 
rote. I got the impression it was just 
another reading of the same old material 
for her, while Mr. Burnshaw looked upon it 
as a whole new endeavor. There was a 
first-time feeling about his poems, even the 
ones that were read twice to illustrate his 
point. Distinguishing that there are two 
kinds of poems: 1) those that are assimila
ted by an audience from one reading, and 
2) those that are too complex, condensing 
too many ideas/images into a relatively 
small area, for an audience to grasp all con
cepts after hearing it only once. Burnshaw 
then went on to choose appropriate poems 
that supported his theory.
He neeaiessiy commented, Maybe 
somethings wrong with my theory,** when 
one of his once through examples aroused 
the audience to the point where he was 
requested to read it again. His theory stood 
in no threat, though, because the request 
had nothing to do with the need for clar
ification, but because of the sheer impact 
of the poem.
Though it wasnt as obvious that the 
audience was being taught as it had been 
with Ms. Howes, Mr. Bumshaws point had 
just as strong an influence. It is his feeling 
that its a readers job to choose poems 
that an audience can easily follow. Poems 
of this nature are usually characterized by 
refrains and repetitions, narratives, and 
dialogue.
Poems that require repeated readings 
according to Burnshaw are generally short, 
yet have involved messages. The con
ciseness of the style along with the abun
dance of meaning, forces the writer to be 
sparse but particular. A writer must choose 
the one word thatll get the right return in 
a connotative way. Each word is a rare 
gem, and the additional reading is nece> 
sary to allow the audience to reflect every 
sparkle.
Much of Stanley Burnsnaws poetry 
seems closely drawn from his own exper
iences, often the most common everyday 
occurances. And yet the magic is in his 
ability to transform those events into a 
multi-faceted jewel, displayed and tempt
ing to the audience. Even his translated 
poems, which he calls second hand 
poems, unmistakingly have his voice.

Wednesday, March 15  Chapter 11  FREEDOM
The war is over but racists like spiteful Evan Brent and wily Senator Justin 
have no intention of tolerating the newly freed "upitty niggers," Ol' 
George and Martha join the family in sharecropping and are doing well 
until rampaging night riders destroy their crops. Tom, still a blacksmith, 
files a special mark on each horse shod to enable him to identify future 
riders. The sheriff promises to act on proof and Tom takes him evidence 
found after another raid. With Brent in charge, Justin assumes owner
ship of the plantation and announces that Tom cannot leave because of 
an outstanding debt.
Thursday, March 16  Chapter 12  FREEDOM (Con't.)
Brent hires Ol' George as overseer, and slavery, to all intents and pur
poses, is back in business. Chicken George arrives and concocts a plan to 
extricate his family from under Brent's thumb and move them to his rich 
farmland he now owns in Tennessee. Subservient attitudes in town, 
coupled with Ol" George's simulated brutality and his acquisition of five 
new mulls, pave the way for the exodus. Lured into an abush at the plan
tation, a beaten and broken Brent is left while Chicken George and the 
others leave slavery behind forever. In Tennessee they start a prosper
ous new life, fulfilling Kunta Kinte's abiding dream of freedom.

Several people, in regards to the Feb.

the possible combinations allows white 
to check, thus postponing the mate. Like 
so:
1 . .N-B6 ch

3K-R1 RXN (3)
4 N-N4 ch
There are a number of ways black can 
prevent N-N4 ch, however this would not 
give mate in the specified number of 
moves. Later analysis seems to indicate 
that 1 . . ., RXN will bring about mate in 
the least number of moves.

indoor season
by Cre
Though the winter was long, the season 
was short. The indoor track season, that is. 
The Carnegie-Mellon trackmen completed 
their winter track schedule with a com
petitive relay meet held at Slippery Rock 
State College. The meet was called, appro 
priately, Rock Relays. There were many 
fine teams entered from various parts of 
the state as well as Ohio and West Virginia.
Jeff Klaiber ran an aggressive lead-off 
leg for the distance ni;dley team. His 
2:07.5 half-mile split gave the baton to 
quartewniler Keith Knestaut in conten
tion. After 57.0 seconds, Larry Gordon 
palmed the baton. The CMU veteran 
ran hard, hitting splits of 60.0, 2:07, and 
3:14.5 for his % mile leg. Anchoring, 
Dario Donatelli ran his mile in 4:34.5 
to put the team in fourth place.
The first event of the meet was a speccial 3-mile for the distance men. Steve 
Crelli and Steve Faloon competed for 
Tartans. Running against a huge field, the 
two ran respectable times finishing sixth 
and eighth. 
With only a few runners hoping to run 
in another indoor meet, the rest of the 
Tartans are preparing for the more impor
tant outdoor activity in the spring. The 
outdoor season begins on April 8 with a 
duel against Washington & Jefferson at 
home. Anyone walking the campus who 
thinks they can handle the school work 
and workout everyday, talk to Coach 
Meckley and join the team.

Ron Pontius gets national orientation
by Mike Jochmann
CMU seems to produce more than its 
share of excellent non-team sport ath
letes. Chess players, fencers, canoeists and 
frisbee players of excellent quality spring 
forth from the Carnegie-Mellon student 
population with great regularity.
It might be argued that the combination 
of individualistic self-discipline and in
telligence characteristically required of par
ticipants in these sports is also essential 
for academic success in as difficult a 
school as CMU. This may be true, and the 
schools latest example of individualistic 
sports excellence lends credence to the
argument.
He is Ron Pontius. Offering tangible 
evidence of his ability is the United States 
Orienteering Federation (USOF), who 
made Pontius one of its male invitees, the 
only one from Pennsylvania, to its 3-day 
selection race in Minneapolis to determine 
the Federations representative team to the 
1978 World Orienteering Championships 
in Norway this September.
Orienteering is euphimistically referred 
to as the thinking sport and 
therein lies the connection among Car
negie-Mellon, Ron Pontius, and orien
teering.
What is orienteering? Quoting the USOF 
news release, it is, the art of navigating 
across unfamiliar terrain through the use 
of a topographic map, a compass, and the 
individuals ability to use them to his/her 
best efforts. In competative circles, orien
teering is a race that combines fleet cross
country running with land navigation. 
Competitors only compete against others 
of their own age, sex, and experience. 
With a competition of this caliber (the 
Selection Race), there will be only two 
classes; elite men, and elite women. How
ever, it is not completely a footrace, the 
motto-THE THINKING SPORT-is de
rived from the fact that the competitors 
must be fleet of mind as well in that 
they must choose the best routes to each 
of the check points. The shortest distance 
between two points is not always a straight 
line. In orienteering, that distance may be a 
200 foot hill. So the competitor is tasked 
both physically (courses will range from 
7-9 kilometers each day over wooded 
terrain), and mentally as well since an error 
of one type or another costs them valuable 
time and the person(s) with the fastest 
times over the three different courses 
are the winners.
Pontius, a 20 year old junior double ma
jor in Electrical Engineering and AMS, 
began thinking about the sport soon after 
graduating from Seneca Valley High 
School near Zelionople, Pa. I started as a 
freshman with Sergeant Adderly of the 
ROTC department. He started the club, 
but eventually he talked me into taking 
it over.
The aquisition of that responsibility
was a major factor in Pontius rise from 
obscurity to a number three ranking 
among orienteers his age in this country. 
Specifically, his responsibilities include 
leading the 20 active members of the 
orienteering club, and to set the course 
for meets his club sponsors. Setting a 
course really sharpens skills, explained 
Pontius. Were going to stage a- Class A 
meet next fall.
The navigation skills which Pontius aquired early on have been through par
ticipation in actual meets. Everything I 
need to compete is in my head, asserts 
Pontius. All I can do is practice a bit.
Pontius and his fellow club members 
have practiced more than a little bit. 
Last year alone, the CMU club travelled
16,000 miles to meets in 14 states and in 
Canada. Their stopping points included 
such diverse places as St. Louis, Southern 
Illinois University, Kalamazoo and Sault 
Saint Marie, Michigan, various places in 
Ohio, West Point, New York, Virginia 
Beach, and Boston.
Pontius, himself, will participate in 
several meets this spring, the most impor
tant of which is the Intercollegiate Cham
pionships in St. Louis. The USOF sanc
tioned meet offers the best of red 
competition, or 57 kilometer courses, 
to college competitors. At the meet, a 
seven man intercollegiate team will 
be selected that will be eligible to compete 
in the World University Meet in Finland 
late this summer.
Thus, Pontius could conceivably qualify 
for two international competitions by the 
end of the summer. However, for the 
Selection Race Championships in Min
neapolis, he will have to overcome orien
teers used to competing on a blue, or 
79 kilometer course with more difficultly 
placed control points. Pontius has never 
run one in competition.
To compensate, Pontius, already a good 
distance runner, has been working up the 
miles--running 5 to 6 seven and onehalf minute miles with hopes of working 
up to 8-10 of these by the end of April. 
He has even enlisted the services of a 
training coach, cross-country runner 
Greg Keyes, to prod him through all those 
miles.
The rolling course in Minneapolis is 
not the only uphill Pontius will face 
since Pontius, like all orienteers, incurs

feels the only practical way for him to 
attend the meet and still not miss too 
much school is to fly. This, of course, will 
make the trip more expensive. Thinking 
man that he is, Pontius is working on that 
problem as well.
Dedication, talent, and experience-- 
Pontius is working to make them add up 
to a spot on the five man U.S. team eligible

Pontius is very optimistic about his chances 
of doing well at the Intercollegiate meet 
but is more guarded about the Selection 
Race in Minneapolis.
Still, an expression of determination 
locks onto Pontius face when he dis
cusses the matter. They call it orienteer

got as good a chance as anyone.

"Buggy fever" causes Carnival atmosphere
by Michael Gibbs
As spring and Spring Carnival approach, 
many highly spirited individuals contract 
CMUs very own and unique Buggy 
Fever. These dedicated and seemingly 
tireless warriors have already begun in 
their preparation for the annual Sweep
stakes battle. Last year 25 buggies from 14 
organizations competed in the eight-tenths 
of a mile race. Well over 200 pushers, 
drivers, and pit crew workers were required 
to field this large number of entries. In 
addition, thousands of man-hours of work 
went into each entry prior to race day.
Normally by this time of year pushers 
could be seen late at night perfecting their 
pushing techniques on Tech and Frew 
Streets. Any pusher will attest to the fact 
that propelling a buggy up one of these 
steep hills is not as easy as it may appear. 
Unfortunately, the weather has been a
problem this year. According to Gerd 
Beckman, Sweepstakes Chairman, Permits 
for push practice began the first of March 
and freerolls have been scheduled every 
Saturday and Sunday since the last week
end in February. As soon as the weather 
breaks we will be ready to roll.
And roll they will if last year is any
indication............Pika was crowned champion for the third straight year as their 
experienced and well rounded push team 
pushed to a new course record of 2:17.8, 
one and one-half seconds faster than the 
old record which they had set two years 
earlier. Although it was their second one 
day victory in three years, the setting of 
a new course record undenialby places the 
brothers of Pi Kappa Alpha as the top 
buggy organization on campus.
For Sigma Nu, the second place finisher, 
last year marked the end of a legend. The 
Zoos Hornet, built in the late 1960*s, had
the reputation as the fastest and highest 
rolling buggy on campus for many years. 
Last year, however, Hornet was involved in 
a high speed collision with Betas 825, and 
although no one was injured, all indications 
are that the Hornet was damaged beyond 
repair and will not return.
For CIA, 1977 may mark the beginning 
of an era. As third place finishers, CIA 
posts the best finish by any independent 
organization in many years. Members of 
that organization are looking forward to 
working similar feats of magic this year.
ATO, always a strong competitor with a 
good push team, finished fourth in a very 
close race with SAE who finished fifth 
only eight-tenths of a second back. Both 
teams promise to be vying for top place 
finishes again this year as ATO managed 
to keep their tires on the rims all the way 
through the bottom turn and SAE will be 
returning with last years new buggy that
performed extremely well.
For Beta, 1977 is the year they would 
like to drop from the record books. Al
though their new buggy ran the second 
fastest time of the day, also breaking Pikas 
old record, it was disqualified because it 
failed to reach the starting line in time. 
They were, however, able to salvage a sixth 
place finish with their B buggy, 825. The 
accident between Sigma Nus Hornet and 
825 crippled both organizations hopes of 
catching fast rolling Pika on the second day 
of races.
Last years was an exciting, well fought 
race. This year will unquestionably be one 
of the best Sweepstakes in recent years. 
The times will be fast and the races will be 
close, As soon as the snow melts and the 
roads are dry, look for freerolls and push 
practices as inidviduals with buggy fever 
prepare to answer to the gun on a warm, 
sunny morning in April.
Nerd Knockers, Reality advance 
IM playoffsin

W&J, Cal State finish CMU
CMU women's basketball teem concluded their
this i
by Perry Colosimo
The womens basketball team did not 
fare well in their last two farewell games of 
the season. The Tartans bowed to Wash 
ington and Jefferson last Tuesday (63-51 
and to California State College (67-49) th> 
following Saturday.
The closer of the two contests was against W&J on W&Js home floor. The 
game was nip and tuck throughout most of 
the game, W&J leading'at the half by 6. 
CMU pulled to within 2 points before W&J 
exploded with 16 unanswered points, most 
of which were scored by Karen Elfenminger, who finished as the games leading 
scorer with 23 points. With the aid of 
Terry Preskars 11 points, Brandi Jacksons 
10 points, and Gale Gammerdingers 8 
points, the Tartans closed the gap to 
8 points but couldnt gain any more 
ground on the W&J squad which was aided 
quite frequently and flagrantly by the 
many man-to-man defenses, had trouble 
with turnovers and the size of the Cal. 
State squad, as the half time score (29-9) 
indicated. Rebounds were few and far 
between for CMU due to the presense
referees.
A stubborn man-to-man Califronia State 
defense hindered the Tartans in the follow
ing game. The Tartans, who have not faced 
of Cal. States Maggie Cavenaugh (19 pts.) 
and Crystal Kochka (18 pts.). Cal State 
used a perimeter offense to draw the 
Tartans out of position thus enabling them 
to dump the ball inside.
The Tartans were salvaged somewhat by 
the perfomance of Barb Owens who garbbed the majority of the Tartans sparse 
rebounds and pumped in a game high 21 
points. Terry Preskar was next in scoring 
for CMU with 8 points.
Mid-way through the game, Davina 
Davies of CMU suffered a cut on the chin 
which required stitching, in a head on 
collision while diving for a loose ball. 
Coach Kepple said that she should be okay, 
however.
The Tartans cut their half-time defecit 
to 7 points but, again, could not sustain 
the pace. The final (67-49). Thats it for 
the Womans basketball season. Look for 
a wrap up of the season in next week's 
TARTAN.
Volleyball Club 
maintains first, 
wins Pitt Tourney
by Mike Pochan

The CMU Club Volleyball Team con
tinues to dominate the Western Pennsyl
vania Intercollegiate League with a tirstplaee finish in the Pitt Invitational and a 
fourth-place finish at Slippery Rock. 
Overall, CMU has a substantial first-place 
lead over Cal State in the league standings.
At the Pitt tournament, CMU finished 
first in round robin play, then proceeded 
to trample Pitt II 15-13, 15-7. In the grand 
finale, CMU defeated the host team Pitt I 
13-15,15-7,15-10.
At Slippery Rock, CMU faltered for the 
first time in five tournaments, placing 
fourth after a disappointing loss to Alle
gheny 14-16,14-16.
CMU II won a couple of games and 
narrowly missed making the playoffs at 
the Pitt tournament.
