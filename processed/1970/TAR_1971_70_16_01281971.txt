New Course Studies 
Student Housing Crisis
by DEBBIE HOLDSTEIN
In a proposal dated January 1,1971, a course concerning Student Housing was introduced by John Gross, chairman of a Housing Committee within the Student Senate. Conceived without the inevitable insecurity of most new courses, the Student Housing course was developed as an innovative, successful course, with student participation generating the excitement that only a thriving course can initiate.
Student involvement in the course has a very simple goal: solve the student housing problem, with emphasis on the stu- dent-owned housing project. It is through the following four fields of investigation that the entire program can be fully examined: a) Marketing research  what type of housing will be attractive to students? b) Financingavailability of government and private loans and grants; initial funding of project, capital financing; c) Educational programs and facilities  feasibility of ways to incorporate into a housing project; d) Design  solutions to typical dormitory problems: noise, regimentation, felxibility.
The student-run course coordinates the four groups through scheduled class meetings, with faculty advisors for each of the groups. The class itself is neither
faculty nor administration-initiated, with thorough knowledge of federal laws, business operation and relation between the business and the community, necessary factors in the successful completion of the course.
The history of the Student Housing course began with the campaign of Pat Cavanagh for the Student Senate presidency. Upon collaboration with lawyer John Flaherty, it was determined that federal and insurance company investments would be more than a mere possibility. Sites have even been considered, one being the the Panther Hollow area. The concept of student-run housing was first proved successful in Portland, where students renovated old buildings in the area for housing, and later acquired a three million dollar loan for additional student construction.
The practice of student-run housing is quite common in Europe and when the detailed progress report of the course is completed in March, hopefully the plans will be considered along with the Universitys preliminary housing studies. With the idea of applying housing concepts for both students and the community, needs of both will be met. and the rewards of the student-run housing will prove to the long-awaited answer to the C-.Ml" housing problem.
Dave Caney Editor, THE TARTAN:
The brothers of Kappa Sigma wish the Apollo 14 astronauts the best of luck, especially to Commander Edgar D. Mitchell, a brother who graduated in 1952 with a degree in industrial management. Commander Mitchell will carry a Kappa Sigma pin. to the moon along with his personal belongings and will return the pin when he visits the campus at this 
years commencement. In a letter to the chapter earlier this year, Mitchell expressed regret that he would not be able to wear the pin because of the dangers it would present to his warm little body.

Faculty Women Bonding
To Gain Recognition
by DEBBIE HOLDSTEIN
As part of the growing concern over the plight of the educated female in society, the women of the Carnegie-Mellon faculty have bonded together as the C-MU Academic Women. The general purpose of the group, which numbers about 50 at present, is to serve as an advocate of the women of Carnegie-Mellon.
The initial, immediate goals of the Academic Women are to investigate the status of women at C-MU and, at the same time, to formulate policy guidelines for all C-MU women (faculty, staff and students) in the area of equal opportunity in education and employment. The group hopes to become the focal point of women in all categories and a permanent office that they hope to set up with help from the administration will mark formal recognition of C-MU women.
Subcommittees have been established to investigate the primary concern within the group. The Salary Committee is working on promotion rates and salaries to determine if they are hindered or, as the case may be, helped by their sex. It has been found thatthe higher you go, the less women at the top and a subcommittee headed by Mrs. Ruth Corrigan, frunt Library, and Dr. Jan Cohn, Department of English, is doing research with the universities and organizations of the United States
as reference. Their goal: to see how womens status is improving and how to apply this information to the women at C-MU.
The long-awaited news of daycare may be coming at last. With the interaction of the C-MU Academic Women and the student Womens Lib group, a day care center is scheduled to open here no later than September, 1971. 
Sites have already been selected for the center, designed with an experimental format to assist all women on the C-MU campus. This is only one of the ways in which C-MU Academic women hope to be in contact with the student body. Other committees formed with the student body included one concerned with curriculum (it was this committee that brought you the courses exploring sex roles this semester) and plans for a series of luncheon forums in conjunction with the Activities Board.
The Academic Women intend to have a positive impact on the C* MU female population and to look ahead to the women who have made it in professional careers. Their function is not to isolate within themselves as a group, but to act for all C-MU women. The office will coordinate the educational, occupational and practical (equal opportunities, etc.) aspects of the status of women, with all of C-MUs women the beneficiaries of these efforts.
Senate granted money to everyone that asked this weekincluding itself. One thousand seven hundred and seventy and one-half American dollars were distributed among four campus supplicants.

Senate Meets
by DOUG CAMPBELL
Vol. 10, No. 16
The Martin Luther King, Jr. Schol
arship Fund starts it fourth drive I 
next Monday to help students in 
financial need meet the exhorbitant costs of this place. This fund is 
the only mechanism we have on 
campus for helping other students 
and in particular, as intended in 
the establishment of the Fund, | 
Black students.
In the past three years, $24,000 I 
has been collected for the fund. 
Eighteen thousand has been giv
en to C-MU students. The rest 
went to initiating an endowment | 
fund last year in Dr. King's name 
with only the interest going to 
needy students  which seemed 
particularly white of the adminis
tration. This year, however, under 
Dean William's chairmanship, the | 
Fund has been returned to being a 
direct ccntribution to students.
Look around you and see how 
many Black students there are. 
Says something, doesn't it? Stu- I 
dent Government has pledged its 
support. If you can spare some 
money, do it. More information 
about the Fund Drive will be forth-J 
coming.

TORA TORA 
TERRENCE
by TERENCE N. PALSO
Just because Tora! Tora! Tora! is the most expensive film ever made and was soundly panned by almost every major film critic in the country is reason enough to see it. With this in mind, this writer discovered to his delight that the film wasnt all that bad. As a matter of fact, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a suspenseful war flick that is really quite enjoyable.
The film deals with the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese by presenting the story from both sides. To the credit of director Richard Fleischer, the Japanese sequences were done in Japan with English subtitles instead of being dubbed. The Japanese sequences, in fact, are the best in the film, and were directed by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, who were somewhat synpathet- ic to their side. If one chooses to believe the opening titles which state that everything seen in the film is based on historical fact, then one sees an entirely new view of those warriors from the land of the Rising Sun. For a change no one even utters an, Ah, so, or a Bonzai! and the audience is not treated to the sight of thousands of small, slant eyed young men with buck teeth thirsting after the blood of their enemies. To be sure there are several of these charachters around, but the majority of the naval officers in charge do not want war with the United States at any cost for they realize that they must inevitably lose. The enthusiasm evidenced by the Japanese pilots in the film is the result of being indoctrinated in the now less popular philosophy that war is good, and exciting, and also from the fact that they will get a helluva lot of pride from proving the United States isnt invincible.
The American portion of the film show the previously hashedover-a-thousand-times-mistakes and blunders which our side made to leave Pearl Harbor as vulnerable as possible to attack. It is infuriating to sit and watch so many governmental and military errors being made. It really makes one wonder how effective would our defenses be today in the event of the same type of thing. After all, the men in charge are still the products of the same training which produced the officers at Pearl and today it is not considered such a fantastic honor to serve the country, so the soldiers who man the radar screens care leven less.
Watching the American mistakes and the skillful, methodical plotting of the Japanese unfold is fascinating and it is here that the film has its greatest strengths. Despite the fact that the audience knows the outcome, director Fleischer manages to build up an air of tension. Just when this tension is reaching its greatest height, however, an intermission is inserted and from then on the film never fully recovers. The intermission is clearly unnecessary for the film is not over-long, and more than that, it damages the film because the audience never again builds up to the emotional pitch which they had before they were given the chance to buy that second container of greasy, buttered popcorn, or to see what the clod sitting behind them making all the great comments looks like.
After the intermission, when the film should be its strongest, it goes downhill. Presumably a great deal of the twenty-five million or so dollars that this
film reportedly cost went into special effects. Unfortunately, the viewer will have to look very hard to see this expenditure as the bombing of Pearl clearly does not rank among the best war scenes ever filmed. As a matter of fact, the bombing sequences are rather routine and do not even capture the totality of the event. Rather it seems that there is one explosion going on here, a ship blowing up over there, and an ammo dump going up across the street, but these events are filmed to seem almost unrelated. There are virtually no shots which even attempt to make one aware of the fantastic amount of destruction, or even of the number of men who were killed. In fact, had the audience been unaware of what originally happened, they would have little knowledge of the actual event from watching this motion picture.
The weakness of Tora! Tora! Tora! lies in precisely what Hollywood does best: specialeffects. No matter what else may be wrong with them, Hollywood pictures are known for their sheer technical superiority. Yet, while they are there, the effects in the films just arent that special. It therefore becomes rather ironic when

Grad School
RATINGS
by JON MANON
The American Council on Education released, in early January, the results of 1969 survey of American graduate schools. Ratings of graduate facilities were based upon the replies of 6,093 scholars who rated programs in their own fields of study, and were displayed with thirty-six different graduate disciplines. A rating of 2.0 to 2.4 was considered adequate plus, one of 2.5 to 2.9, good, and 3.0 to 5.0, strong or distinguished. Following are the C-mu graduate schools which rated 3.0 or better and their relative rank among all schools ranking 3.0 or higher:
Economics14Psychology30Chemistry30Physics22Chemical Engineering13Civil Engineering13Electrical Engineering17Mechanical Engineering11Additionally, the Carnegie-Mel- lon graduate school of mathematics was classified in the good range.
A more complete exposition of the survey appears in the
January fourth issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education. Copies of the full report, entitled A Rating of Grapuate Programs, may be obtained from the American Council or Education, One Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. 20036.
This survey and similar previous ones have not escaped criticism. Representatives of the American Council on Education, however, justify the survey as a guideline to protect the potential consumer of graduate education from inadequate programs.

angel of mercy REBUTTAL
Dear Sir:
Too often, good deeds go unnoticed and unsung! On Friday, January 15th, a snow squall made driving a hazardous affair. A group of students from your school patrolled the Forbes- Morewood section; lending physical and moral support to aid the many cars that found all of the roads treacherous. This was done in a friendly and angel of mercy spirit.
I want to thank those young men who were so kind and thoughtful in their endeavor.
Gratefully,
Rose Herman 5864 Darlington Road, Pgh.
Editor, THE TARTAN:
I guess I could write a rebuttal to the recent letter on Drama Department Rules, or I could state my own views on discipline, etiquette, and courtesy in the cooperative arts.
But I dont think letters to editors about specific departmen tal activities help university-wide communication. The readers dont have sufficient background to fully understand the implications of the discussion. Certainly the students in Drama are fully capable of judging whether or not the rules are helpful to the operation of an educational theatre on the campus. I suspect they have already done so. The rules and the way in which they function in day to day practice can best be worked out on a one to
one basis within the department.
I do want to write of my convictions concerning the treatment in the letter of Professor Nelson. Here 1 write as an Alumnus. I have no doubt that the several hundred designers and production people, not to mention actors and directors who have passed through the Department during Mr. Nelsons tenure would attest that his example to students through concern for theatre itself and lighting in particular, concern for other craftsmen in the theatre, his care of detail both in the doing of the craft and teaching of it, have been major aspects of their training in the theatre. Letter writers cannot tarnish his record as a teacher of diminish his ability to plant the seed of self discipline in his students.
Sincerely yours,
Bob WolffDrama 60

Dealing with specific prob
lems has- long been the ap
proach (if indeed there has 
been an approach) of the Aca
demic Affairs Board. However, 
this semester the office seeks 
to go beyond just that. After 
all, the whole of academics 
can't limit its scope to prob
lems, but must also consider 
areas of improvement even 
ehen problems haven't reached 
the crisis proportion.
In its service to the univer
sity, the AAB is trying to ini
tiate a spirited assault on the 
taboo regarding student/faculty 
communications (or lack there
of). A committee at present 
consisting of one John Holobinko (no sense getting bogged 
down in bureaucracy!) is inves
tigating possible solutions to 
the dilemma. Anyone (faculty 
and students) intrigued by this 
particular'anathema please con
tact John (682-9450) or myself 
(687-7687).
Due to the time consuming 
complexities of bureaucratic ad
ministration, the questionnaire 
mentioned in last week's article 
was late going out. Please try 
to get them filled out  it won't 
take long, and bring them to 
the Academic Affairs Board 
Meeting on Feb. 4, at 4:30 in 
room 46 Skibo. (Yes - I KNOW 
that's only one week.) The next 
meeting should be a short one.

Student Help Center
by SHERRY SUKOL
The Student Help Center is an independent referral service created and staffed by students of medicine, law and social work. Its services are available to anyone who needs them, although it is primarily intended to help other young people. The center was founded on the premise that students of the professions are in a unique position to serve people who are unwilling or unable to seek help through regular channels. A person of high school or college age who goes to the center will find someone with an outlook similar to his own who is willing to listen sympathetically to his problem, and who can refer him to the proper agency if he needs professional help.
Persons who need assistance are encouraged to go to the centers store front office at 304 South Bouquet Street in Oakland, where each weekday a different team of staff members is on duty from noon until 10 p.m.
With the cooperation of members of the Pittsburgh professional community, the center sponsors lectures and seminars on community social, legal, and medical needs and the general problems of health and legal delivery systems.
The center is not intended to supplant existing agencies.
Members are eager to cooperate with any agency to bring the maximum service to clients. Call 683-2133 for help.

WRESTLINGTHE ACTIVITIES BOARD PRESENTSRAGA
Saturday afternoon, the C-Mu wrestling team lost to an excep- tionally strong Waynesburg 
team 36-6. Winning by decision for C-MU were Alan Ko- han at 134 (8-3) and Pete Kel- ston at 142 (10-6). The rest of the team showed definite im- provement over the first two matches. The team was in better shape than previously and everyone wrestled much better. Moves were executed faster, harder, and sharper than during the first two matches. Special recognition should go to Dave Lurie (heavyweight) for even going on the mat against the mountain he was to wrestle. Dave might have had a better chance against a dumb bear rather than the man he faced who knows enough about wrestling to be ranked fifth nationally and has the quickness and muscles to back him up.
As the season continues, greater improvement by the team should certainly make the meets interesting. The next scheduled meet is at Duquesne, Friday, with a possible meet against St. Vincent next Tuesday. As the schedule stands, there will be only one more home meet, February 19, versus Grove City. By that time, the team will be more experienced and much stronger. They will then be capable of treating the 200 fans who have shown up for first two home meets to a C-MU victory.

CARNEGRIBy mTORK
Once again the students of C-MU have proved they will not do something just 
wu(nu)u they are required to. A curriculum trend now has students defining what 
(Cue)u) and requirements will be needed for graduating. Last semester with the 
5t8vue)8fy demanding gym class as a prerequisite to graduation, only 80 students 
eug8)fueui for participation in organized physical education. This semester the 
5t8vue)8fy amended its policy and allowed for gym as an elective. With the 
euoCvnr of the you have to take it atmosphere, over 200 students have elected 
fC fnsu gyol Way to go, Pag5 students! It would appear that our students want to 
fnsu (Cue)u) but dont register for them just because someone says they have to. 
puehnp) its because the gym courses they are offering this semester are more 
iu)8enwruc for example, skiing and gymnastics.******
Thueu is a mythical home-court advantage during basketball season. Various 
n)pu(f) of the game perpetuate this myth: the team is most comfortable on its 
C1t court because theyve already got the range for their shots; the home 
funo chooses and is responsible for the officials (thus the home fans believe its 
nr1ny) the other team that will get homered), the cheering for the home team 
8) usually louder and more boisterous which influences the players to perform 
wuffuel A final, but often overlooked factor is the playing of the National Anthem. 
If) inconceivable to imagine a football or baseball game starting without the 
mfne Spangled Banner sending adrenelin through the teams and the crowd. 
Th8) is a part of the pre-game warm-up and both teams and the fans are aware of 
8f n) )u(hl However, basketball presents another story. Playing of the National 
Atfhuo before a basketball game seems to be directly proportional to the 
5t8vue)8fy) athletic budget.
Thu home team knows whether its athletic department has provided for the 
Nnf8Ctnr Anthem so that they can warm up accordingly. If its going to be played 
fhueu) no sense getting so sweaty that you feel a draft while you face the flag; on 
fhu Cfhue hand if its not going to be played you can get as worked up as possible, 
stC18tg that the game will begin immediately. However, the anxiety of not 
stC18tg whats going to happen after the buzzer to end the warm-ups and the 
wuzzue to start the game can drive a player crazy. There is nothing worse than 
wu8tg nrr fired up to play and run and jump and instead have to remain still while 
E gnhnr8n Jackson wails over the ramparts. An example might further explain 
fh8)l
Af last weeks home game, anxiety was felt by everyone as our announcer 
n)sui for everyone to rise to dead silence. Whether it was a mechanical fault or 
tC mechanics were at hand, the recording of our National Anthem was never 
)fnefuil Finally the fans began to sing (lead by Dave Stobbe on one side of the 
(Cuef and Jim Salners on the other). The anxiety felt by the fans represents the 
1ny fhu National Anthem is truly part of the home court advantage.
Two apologies from last weeks paper and an explanation. First apology goes 
fC fhu Swimming team. There were two boxes containing swimming results but 
Ctry one was put in the paper. Evidently the other was lost at the printers. The 
)u(Cti apology goes to the basketball team. Somehow the printer pre-empted the 
Wu)fo8t)fue box score with the St. Vincent one. Sorry bout that! And now for a 
pnef8nr explanation of the last announcement. Marchie Schwartz is the skinny 
I ines haired 9th grade kid who lives in the gym. He knows all the I.M. players by 
I tnouc and more statistics about previous varsity contests than the coaches. Keep 
I 1nf(h8tg for our interview on this colorful character.
Nuuiui: Sports reporters . . were not after statistics, but rather a more
pue)Ctnr and objective look at sports happenings. This can be in the form of 
peui8(f8Ct)c objections, or whatever. But mostly we need volunteers! Please?

The biggest IM sport of the year begins this week with 64 teams entered, (ed. note: 213 participated on 45 teams during 3-man volleyball as compared to 700 participants on 64 basketball teams; 24 major teams, 22 intermediate, and 18 minor league teams.) Only eight will survive the major league conference schedule _and make it to the playoffs which will be highlighted by the intramural championship game on March 5. This is the night when the Pittsburgh Steelers will arrive in the Skibo Gym for their annual playoff against the C-MU intramural allstars.
