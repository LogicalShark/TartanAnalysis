CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITYVOL. 71, NO. 3SEPTEMBER 30, 197!
President H. Guyford Steyer
Faculty Salaries Frozen
Draft Law Limited
President Stever last week 
announced the administrations 
decision regarding faculty salary 
increases in light.of President Nix
ons Wage-Price Freeze. It was bad 
news for those people who were 
expecting an increase, but ac
cording to the Faculty Affairs 
Council, the Administration made 
every effort to find interpretations 
of the Wage-Price Freeze regula
tions which would have permitted 
the payment of the agreed on raise 
for all faculty members.
President Stevers announce
ment follows:
The administration has studied 
as carefully as possible the regula
tions governing the Wage-Price 
Freeze issued by the Cost of Living 
Council as they apply to CarnegieMellon University. Of course the 
University will comply with Presi
dent Nixons executive order. We 
have consulted University counsel 
and the Deans of the Colleges, and
have discussed the matter with the 
Faculty Affairs Council. We have 
also surveyed our sister institu
tions, both in and out of the city of 
Pittsburgh.
At this time our best judgment 
concerning the legality of paying 
salary increases to CMU personnel 
during the period of the freeze is as 
follows:
All personnel, faculty and non
faculty, who are on a twelve
month contract beginning July 1,
1971, will continue to receive their 
salary increases.
All faculty members who have 
worked during the summer 
months of July and/or August and 
who were paid at an increased rate 
will continue to receive their salary 
increases.
All faculty members who have 
received promotions will receive 
salary increases.
All other faculty members, 
namely those who have not been 
promoted and who have not 
worked during the summer 
months at an increased rate, are 
prohibited from receiving salary 
increases during the period of the 
freeze.
This last conclusion (No. 4) 
was, of course, a hard dedsion to 
make. There appears, however, to 
be no other choice at this time that 
the University can make in light of 
the regulations.
The University wants to pay 
ALL approved salary increases, 
and through our legal counsel, the 
Faculty Affairs Council, and other 
avenues is continuing efforts to 
find justification for paying them 
to the l^culty in category 4. In
cluded in our efforts is a request to 
the Cost of living Council for a 
ruling relating to our situation. If 
the ruling is unfavorable, we will 
consider asking for an exemption 
from the wage freeze based on 
either equity or hardship, or both.
Until we receive a definitive rul
ing and until we learn what alterna
tives are available to us in the post
freeze period, the money for the 
salary increases of faculty in cate
gory 4 is being set aside so that 
these increases will be paid 
promptly if a legal basis for doing 
so can be found. We hope that it 
can be, in order that all faculty will 
be treated equitably.
Those faculty members af
fected by this decision should feel 
free to discuss the matter with 
their deans, who have been sup
plied with the pertinent regult-? 
tions, or with Dr. Schatz.
With the passage by the Senate 
last week of the draft extension 
bill, the Selective Service System is 
once again authorized to induct 
men into the armed forcesbut 
with a few strings.
First, the draft will last only 
until July 1, 1973. President 
Nixon hopes to have replaced draft 
calls with sufficient numbers of 
volunteers by then, and the induc
tion machinery will be put on ice 
in case of national emergency. Af
ter that date, therefore, 18-year 
olds will still have to register with 
the Selective Service.
Secpnd, male college students 
no lqi|er receive automatic defer
ments iwhile in school. Congress, 
bowBg to pressure from college 
studdpts and others for a more 
equitable draft, agreed to author
ize thl President to end the under
graduate deferments, a step he has 
already promised to take.
Starting this past summer new 
students (not enrolled in the
1970-71 academic year) will not 
be deferred, although if they 
started classes they may postpone 
induction until the present term 
ends. All other students are eligible 
for induction after four years in 
college or when they reach 24 
years of age, whichever comes 
first.
Third, lottery numbers will ap
ply to all men with the same birthdate, regardless of the location of 
their draft boards. Requested by 
the President, this new rule wiU 
end charges that certain draft 
boards are safer than others. 
Thus all men with the same lottery 
number will be inductable at the
same time.
Another provision provides in
centives for more men to volun 
teer. Originally requested by the 
President last year, the $2.4 billion 
pay hike ($1.8 billion for first term 
enlisted men and junior officers) 
will go into effect October 1, un
less the Cost of Living Council, 
which oversees the current wage- ^ 
price freeze, rules otherwise.
Conscientious objectors will be 
given two-year assignments to civi
lian service. The Senate-House 
Conference Committee empha
sized that this work will parallel 
in his experiences, to a reasonable 
extent, the experiences of the 
young man who is inducted in his 
stead.
The Mansfield amendment to 
require total US troop withdrawal 
from Vietnam was approved in 
modified form as a sense of Con
gress title in the act. Mansfields 
nine-month timetable is now 
stated as the earliest practicable 
date for cessation of all military 
operations of the United States in 
Indochina, and a date cer
tain ... for the prompt and order
ly withdrawal of all United States 
military forces ... subject to the 
release of all American prisoners of 
war held by the Government of 
North Vietnam and forces allied 
with such Government, and an ac
counting for all Americans missing 
in action who have been held by or 
known to sucn Government or 
such forces.
The title also urges the Presi
de! to negotiate with North VietQmtinued on pg. 12
Security To Receive Further Training
The Security Policy Board, 
composed of students, faculty, 
and staff, met last Tuesday to conside r security problems on 
campus.
Chaired by Dr. Robert Shellow, 
the meeting began with an evalua
tion of the progress made in implementing previous Committee 
recommendations. Committee 
suggestions for security proce
dures in Science Hall have been 
acted upon, and so far the building
has been subject to minimal theft.
Security Director Ron Taylor 
told the Committee that the ma
jority of the men on the CMU se
curity force need further training 
in handling the difficult and deli
cate situations likely to occur on 
the campus. He suggested that the 
men be taught to develop verbal 
skills in dealing with people, skills 
which are often sufficient in dif
fusing potentially dangerous situa
tions.
Taylor wants to initiate a new 
form of training, relying heavily on 
the guidance of psychologists 
while security personnel take part 
in pertinent role-playing situa
tions. The program would involve 
a minimum of five six-hour train
ing sessions,- to be -conducted on 
consecutive Saturdays.
Because of this, the security 
force will need two or three auxili
ary personnel to fill in for the 
trainees while they are at the
Saturday training sessions.
Taylor suggested that the Uni
versity hire off-duty City police
man from Number Six station in 
Squirrel Hill as substitutes. Pros
pects would be interviewed by 
Taylor, and those accepted would 
be given a brief orientation session.
The City police hired would not 
patrol the campus by themselves, 
but would be accompanied by a 
regular member of the CMU Secur
ity Force.
Following a lengthy probing of 
the details of Taylors training 
program, including the actual need 
for off-duty police, the Board en
dorsed the entire program. Imple
mentation will begin no sooner 
than Saturday, October ninth. The 
Security Policy Advisory Board 
has reserved fhe right to review the 
program should such a review be 
deemed necessary.

Editor's Note
The days of student organi
zations at Camegie-Mellon are 
numbered. In their prime, student 
organizations could count on large 
and active memberships, largely 
the result of a general student de
sire to be involved on campus, to 
be a BMOC. But during the mid
sixties, when college students out
grew the panty raid-freshman 
beanieHOORAH mentality that 
characterized non-academic uni
versity activity, they also rejected 
involvement in traditional student 
organizations. To join and be 
known as a joiner became un
cool; independence and individu
ality became of primary impor
tance. Values changed, so did 
students interests.
Fraternities were the first to 
feel the effect, and theyve been 
apologizing for themselves and 
mumbling something about bro
therhood ever since. Sororities too 
have been affected, with two of 
the seven here closing down in the 
last three years. Greek Week,
Letters
Homecoming, and Spring Carnival 
get smaller every year.
Two years ago the campus liter
ary magazine, a weak effort at 
best, died for lack of an editor. The 
Carnegie Technical, once a superb 
student-managed journal, last year 
couldnt command either the staff 
or the quality or quantity of copy 
it had known, and published its 
final issues with the single purpose 
of satisfying advertising commit
tments. Even with this years new 
format as a scientific/literary mag
azine, I can hold little hope for the 
Technicals future.
This  year the yearbook has 
ceased publication; the need for 
one ceased long ago. This campus 
is not a community, its a place to 
come to take classes. Who wants a 
$ 10.00 book filled with pictures of 
people you dont know?
While fraternities and sororities 
govern themselves, the rest of the 
crumbling kingdom of campus or
ganizations is ruled by Student 
Senate. No one could give a good
shit what goes on in Student 
Senate.
Apathy reigns on this campus, 
and I only wish I took a more 
active part in it. My only quarrel 
with apathetic students is that 
they make dull news and a disinter
ested audience.
Students today value and enjoy 
concerts, speakers, and films. We 
dont need the TARTAN or 
WRCT, an administrationproduced announcement sheet 
could do the necessary jobs of 
both of them. We dont need a 
literary/technical magazine, a 
Spring Carnival, a Revolutionary 
Allaince, SPIRIT or all the rest of 
our organizations either, with one 
exception.
Lets take the money from our 
dying and generally fruitless cam
pus organizations and put it into 
the Activities Board budget, pro
viding ourselves with a steady flow 
of first-rate concerts, speakers, and 
films. After all, thats what we 
want.

Student Nigger
Editor:
The student of today is no 
bodys nigger. My own experience 
has told me this as an under
graduate in an Eastern College be
tween 1967 and 1971, during 
which time Mr. Farbers article was 
written (1968).
Let me remind Mr. Farber that 
if it werent for his sado-massochistic teachers, he wouldnt be 
able to write at all, least of all this 
dressed-up academic pornography. 
From the language and allitera
tions Professor Farber uses, I 
find him hard to take seriously. 
Who is he trying to impress any
way, talking dirty like a latter-day Lenny Bruce with a Ph.D. I 
know people with eighth grade 
educations who have better vocab
ularies. Mr. Farber sounds to me 
like a never-do well professor who 
decides to make a fast buck in the 
journalism racket by biting the 
hand that fed him. If he thinks his 
students are castrated, he doesnt 
know what goes on behind his 
back or in front of it.
True, Ive been given the choice 
now and then of being a nigger of 
getting a lower grade, and I was 
woman enough to choose the later.
I had to make a choice and I chose 
as I saw fit, but I got out of that 
course what I wanted and I didnt 
need balls to do it. Youve got to 
take bad grades as part of the 
knocks, and go on. That way youll 
never be anyones nigger.

Sculpture
Dear Sir:
In response to your questions
i Editors Note 9/23/71) the sculp
ture on the mall was done by a 
student in our Painting and Sculp
ture Department and placed there 
by him. It was not purchased by
the University. In fact, it will be 
replaced by a sculpture that was 
donated to the University by Clark 
Winter, a professor here and a 
sculptor with pieces on display in 
Carnegie Museum and other area 
museums. That piece is currently 
on loan to Equitable Plaza and will 
be placed at the conclusion of the 
loan period.
I realize that it is easier and 
more rewarding to be sensation
alist rather than objective, but I 
respectfully submit that a rever
ence for truth and objectivity is a 
desirable characteristic for a news
paper editor. Please check your 
facts before you print something. I 
realize that it was an editorial and 
not an article but I feel the pejora
tive tone was uncalled for.
Incidentally, some people, in
cluding myself, feel that the postHornbostle buildings are no better 
and perhaps worse than the ones 
he did design.
Sincerely,
Stephen Fuld 
Chemistry 72 
Member, Campus 
Design Committee
Editor, the TARTAN:
Next to Stever Hall (Science 
Hall to some) is an object referred 
to as construction waste in last 
weeks Editors Note.
Only last week I discovered that 
this was not the case. I had been 
waiting for the greenman to re
move the junk, and was seriously 
considering complaining to phys
ical plant about its being left in 
the middle of the lawn. Then, in a 
flash of insight, I realized that 
somebody must want the object 
there. (After a while, you can be
lieve most anything around here.) 
Therefore the object must be an 
objetdart.
The question in my mind was
why I thought the object was left
over construction crap. A simple 
answer was concerned with my 
taste. I was too vain to accept that 
solution. In search of an alterna
tive solution I decided to take a 
close look at the object-Aha! If I 
tried very hard to isolate the object 
from its surroundings the object 
could actually become attractive 
and I think if it was in suitable 
place, I might like it. The accept
able answer is that the location is 
wrong, and a conclusion that may 
be drawn is not that this school 
cannot produce good art, but that 
this school does not know what to 
do with good art. Im not sure 
which is worse, but in this case the 
effect is the same.

SUPA
Security
Editor:
The September 23rd issue of 
the TARTAN contained an article 
authored by CMU insecurity direc
tor Ron Taylor which mulled over 
the campus crime situation. It em
phasized (with large dots and bold
face type) the conditions which 
make campus residents easy marks 
for criminals and includes a list of 
DOs and DONTs for potential 
crime victims. Very cute Ron. Un
fortunately your job entails a little 
more than being the TARTANs 
crime editor. You and your band 
of Keystone Cops are not watch
men in a cottage cheese factory. 
Acknowledging the problem is not 
akin to solving it. You cannot deal 
with crooks at an academic level. 
Save your a badge and a smile 
approach for H. Guyford.
You may ask (and rightly so), 
Okay, Mr. Smarty-pants critic, 
what should I do? Try arming 
your little munchkins ALL of the
time. A highly visible capacity foi 
violence is a better crime deterrent 
than a visible admonision (sic) that 
you have no power to discourage 
criminal activity. For Gods sake, 
Ron, dont let the Pittsburgh Po
lice patrol on campus. Drug use is 
an undeniable fact of life (existance) on this campus. The new 
Peer Counseling organization is 
proof of this. City Police could be 
bad news. (If youre reading, H. 
Guyford, consider the public rela
tions angle.)
Other alternatives? I am a Penn
sylvania resident who will be 21 
very shortly. The temptation to 
legally purchase a handgun has in
creased with each instance of ripoff. Please give me a visible reason 
to reconsider. Believe me, other 
students feel the same way.
I must appologize for the jingo
ism at the beginning of my sermonette. Certain ways of transmitting 
a message are more effective than 
others.

Moratorium
Editor:
Moratorium Day, Wednesday, 
October thirteenth is a special day 
set aside by citizens all over the 
United States as a day to stand 
together to cry for Peace and Jus
tice, to stand together to cry for 
Truth.
On that day there will be speak
ers and programs on campus to 
remind us that much vigorous rejuvinating action is needed now to 
bring our country back to health. 
Each individual is responsible for 
the health of this nation. Each one 
of us is a cell in the body of Amer
ica. We must all be cells of Love. 
We must sing together in the fall of 
cancer. Without our souls, which 
we must make good, and without 
our bodies, which we must make
strong, America, whose ideals are 
noble, will die.
America has many ills. We 
would like to draw attention this 
Wednesday, October thirteenth to 
only six by asking for:
 Total withdrawal from Viet 
Nam according to the plan pro
posed by the Provisional Revolu
tionary Government of North Viet 
Nam.
 Humane treatment and true jus
tice for men and women in prison.
 Support for United Farm 
Workers Strikes.
 Freedom for all Political 
Prisoners.
 Full employment following the 
Employment Act of 1971.
 An End to the Price Wage 
Freeze.
 Each one of these few requests 
is cause for a great united cry. Join.
The night before Moritorium 
Day, the night of October twelfth, 
there will be a procession in honor 
of the dead moving from four as 
yet unspecified locations to Sol
diers and Sailors Hall in Oakland. 
We ask that business as usual not 
commence the next day, October 
thirteen, but that the day be spent 
in a special way. Remembering 
those who have unjustly died and 
coming to understand more fully 
the problems in our Nation which 
have served to cause their deaths. 
Citizens come together! Now is the 
time!

Announcements
The Department of Modern Lan
guages is planning a semester of 
studies in Spain for the Spring Se
mester of 1971 -1972.
The program is open to all students 
in the University with some know
ledge of Spanish. Students from 
other universities and colleges in 
the area are also invited to partici
pate.
The total cost would be approxi
mately the same as tuition and 
board at CMU and registration will 
be limited to 15 students.
There will be a second meeting of 
all interested students on Friday, 
October 1st at 3:30, room 229-B. 
Please plan to attend as a commit
ment must be made by October 
15th.
Interested in playing CLUG?
CLUG is a "game" which simulates 
the growth of a city. Participants 
take the roles of poor people, hard
hats, small business men, bankers, 
industrialists and attempt to solve 
various urban problems. CLUG is 
an intensive learning experience, 
not a "Milton-Bradley game. 
Contact Y-Office of Community 
Affairs, 57 Skibo, x239or4l6. 
Tutors needed: to work with ele
mentary age children in all subject, 
to teach Junior and Senior High 
math and science subjects.

There will be a meeting of the
Chess Club this Sunday at 1:30 in 
Skibo, 45.
During the past two years a
group of concerned students and 
faculty felt it was important for 
high school students to have a 
greater opportunity to discuss con
temporary political and social is
sues than is normally provided in 
their public school education. To 
be sure, this need still exists and 
will be continuing to present pa
nels or speakers to various hiqh 
school and community groups.
We are organizing a group of 
faculty and students who are willingto work in setting up such a 
supplementary education pro
gram, and to serve as speakers or 
discussion group leaders on sub
jects of present concern.
Due to the educational op
portunities offered to students 
through the project, course credit 
will be available to active partici
pants. If you are interested in serv
ing as a member of a panel or have 
any ideas on how to extend the 
program to make it most effective, 
please contact the YM-YWCA of

In Short, Why Did The Class Fail?
And now, like it or not, Id like 
to say a few parting words.
As you know, I began the seme
ster in a way that departed from 
the manner in which I had taught 
composition classes in the past. 
Much of my attitude at that time 
was influenced by Farbers book, 
The Student as Nigger. On the 
first day of class, I read to you the 
following:
School is where you let the 
dying society put its trip on you. 
Our schools may seem useful: to 
make children into doctors, socio
logists, engineersto discover 
things. But theyre poisonous as 
well. They exploit and enslave stu
dent; they petrify society; they 
make democracy unlikely. And its 
not what youre taught that does 
the harm but how youre taught. 
Our schools teach you by pushing 
you around, by stealing your will 
and your sense of power, by mak
ing timid, apathetic slaves of 
youauthority addicts.
That sounded like a breath of 
fresh air back in February and I 
suggested that we try to break the 
mold, that we could write papers 
on any subject we wanted, that we 
could spend class time discussing 
things, either the burning issues 
of the day or otherwise. You 
seemed to agree, and we spent time 
agreeing together that indeed Far
ber had the word, and we would do 
what we could to break the mold.
As you know, things went from 
initial ecstasy to final catastrophe. 
And recently I fell backno, you 
forced me back into assigning 
general topics. As a result of that 
action, and a lot of other factors, 
this semester has been the worst I 
have ever taught. In fact, I even 
debated with myself whether or 
not to go on teaching next year. 
But in some ways, the semester 
was valuable because I learned 
something, if you didnt.
Let me share with you some of 
the things I learned. Keep in mind 
that this does not apply to all of 
you, but it does apply to the maI learned that all this bull about 
getting it together or working 
together(be it for peace or a 
grade) is just that bull. The 
1950s were labeled by pop socio
logists as the silent generation.! 
assure you that they had nothing 
on you. Ten years ago, the people 
around the fountains word saddle 
shoes, chinos and long hair. Now 
theyre barefoot, wear Army 
fatigues and have long hair. Big 
revelation: its the same bunch of 
people.
Generally, this class has been 
the most silent, reticent, paranoid 
bunch of people in a group I have 
ever encountered.
You had an opportunity to ex
change ideas (which, if often 
turned out, you have not got),
and you were too embarrassed to 
do so.
You had an opportunity to find 
out something about yourselves. 
This, by the way, is the crux of 
education. And as far as I can see, 
you found out very little.
You had an opportunity to ex
plore ideason your ownand 
didnt. Most of the papers hashed 
over the usual cliche-ridden topics. 
One person went so far as to churn 
out a masterpiece on the pros and 
cons of fraternities, a topic that 
was really hot back in 1956.
Most of all, you had the oppor
tunity to be freefree from the 
usual absurdities of a composition 
class where topics are assigned, 
thesis statements are submitted, 
and so on. You also had freedom 
of thought, as long as it was con
fined to the standards of formal 
English. You had the opportunity 
to be freeto be responsible to 
yourselvesand you succeeded in 
proving to me and to yourselves 
that freedom is slavery, a line from 
1984 which I hope, for the sake of 
all of us, isnt prophetic.
But you protest (Oh, how I 
have wished you would): Were 
incapable of handling all this free
dom at once. You see, Mr. Ottinger, weve been conditioned; were 
not used to all of this.
Well, I read that in Farber, too, 
and its bull. Rats and dogs are 
conditioned, and are usually in
capable of breaking that condi
tioning. Human beings can break 
conditioning, if its to their advan
tage. But here its too good an ex
cuse to say, Im conditioned. 
Obviously, then, its to your ad
vantage not to break out of the 
mold.
Why is it to your advantage? In 
short, why did the class fail?
It failed because thinking 
causes pain. And, like good little 
utilitarians, you want to avoid 
pain. Its so much easier to come 
up with instant esthetics, instant 
solutions, instant salvation, instant 
thoughts. After all, instant things, 
like breakfast and TV dinners, are 
easily digestible-and easily regurgitatedand not terribly 
nourishing.
One of the most nauseating re
marks I have heard this semester is, 
Gosh, college is no fun,or, when 
an idea is presented, It doesnt

If you dont believe that know
ledge for its own sake is a valid and 
valuable goal, then youre in the 
wrong place, and youd do much 
better in a vacational school, 
studying how to be a plumber or a 
beautician.
Granted, there are problems 
within the university itselfser
ious problemsthat, despite what 
you may think, show some sign of 
possible solution. One step they 
could take (but probably wont) is 
to limit enrollment, and keep the 
45 per cent of you out who dont 
belong here, because its no fun.
Well, its time, I suppose to 
bring this to a halt, and let, you go 
over to the Commons or wherever. 
As to the next-to-last comment. I 
invite you to listen to the lyrics of 
the Beatles Nowhere Man and, 
if it fits, take it to heart.
Last, I will bid a good-by (until 
the final) and say ihat if at any 
time some sly hint, or clue, or 
(God forbid) a half-truth slipped 
out of my unconscious and out of 
the corner of my mouth and (par
don the expression)turned one of 
you one, then we have not failed, 
you and I.
And to all of you this: I love 
you for what you might be; Im 
deeply disturbed by what you are.

INSULATING WINDOW
The current production of Cole 
Porters ANYTHING GOES marks 
v^hat I hope will be a new era for 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse. Before 
*'" this year the Oakland theatre may 
have boasted the second longest 
tenure in American Regional Thea
tre, but they also produced the 
worst shows this side of McKeesJ gport Junior High School. Now all 
is different. After many 
'lo^1 trying years, the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse has finally established a 
resident Equity (professional) 
company, and what a difference! 
The marked improvement in the
quality of their first show was as 
dynamic a contrast as I have ever 
seen. With the help of many impor
ted professionals the Playhouse is 
bound for better things.
Perhaps ANYTHING GOES 
may not be the ideal choice for an 
opening production, but it served a 
very important purpose in securing 
a foothold for the Playhouse. It 
seems to have been a fine choice 
for many of the older patrons who 
received a hard pitch for contribu
tions opening night. They were 
treated to their kind of theatre in 
the completely renovated Craft
Avenue Theatre.
The show itself was not all that 
could be desired. It proved to be 
sluggish and not valuable as any
thing except a museum piece. But 
for the first time in years it was 
also a showcase for some very fine 
performances. Anyone who had a 
tendency to doze off was brought 
back to life by Jane Coleman 
(Reno Sweeny) who stood out 
with her excellent singing and 
boundless energy. Also good were 
CMlfs own Alan Clarey (Sir Eve
lyn), and Bruce Detrick (Billy 
Crocker), and the funniest perfor
mance of the evening by Earl Boen 
as Public Enemy No. 13, 
Moonface.
This show is not the ideal enter
tainment for anyone here at CMU, 
but it was an indication of fine 
things to come. With their very 
professional Equity company the 
next show, THE BOYS IN THE 
BAND, should be some of the 
finest theatre to come to 
Pittsburgh.
After 22 years, I think we 
deserve it.
-Marc Elliott Field
AS YOU LIKE IT, the Shakes
pearean comedy, will be per
formed by the New Shakespeare 
Company of San Francisco on 
campus Friday, October 8. The 
performance will be staged by the 
Activities Board in the Skibo Ball
room at 9:00 PM. Tickets are free 
with student identification cards.
Actions without words: the 
Art of Pantomime will be the 
topic of a lecture by Jewel Walker, 
Jr., associate professor of drama at 
CMU. The lecture and perfor

October 6, at 8:30 PM in the Skibo 
Ballroom. Tickets are free and may

x Hearing the name, The Allman 
Brothers Band, doesnt bring any 
excitement to mind. At least it 
didnt when I first heard it. After 
hearing them in concert once, mu 
feelings did a one hundred eighty 
degree about-face. It just goes to 
show, Whats in a name?
The Allman Brothers Band is a 
blues-based band, probably the 
best in the country. Their music is 
blues, with just enough jazz to 
bring about a sound which is com
plex, demanding, and one of true 
musicianship. It is more inventive 
than the ordinary rock n roll. By 
that I mean, the blues and jazz 
bring about a sound which is ex
plosive.
I cannot express my feelings 
about them, just that they were so 
overwhelming. I was so impressed 
being a musician myself, to the 
effect they had worked out the 
tempo, changed the mood of a 
song, and pieced together the fab
ric of a song. By changing one com
ponent, another entirely new and 
different sound emerged. Even a 
layman in the field of music will be 
overly impressed with the style of 
the group.
It is no wonder that in the short 
time that the group has been to
gether, they have climbed high and 
surely will continue to rise. Their
success clearly shows in their three 
albums; the first being, The Allman Brothers Band; the second, 
Idlewild South; and the third, a 
double album, Allman Brothers 
live at the Fillmore East. More 
albums are sure to follow, for their 
popularity increases from gig to 
gigAn Allman Brothers Band con
cert is an evening of pure enjoy
ment. It is powerful, brilliant, and 
bold. It will be of no surprise if 
your heart pumps faster, if your 
blood flows with excitement, and 
if a feeling of awe comes over you.
If youre interested in having an 
evening of fun and enjoyment,
then the Allman Brothers Band is 
for you. The Activities Board of 
CMU is presenting the Allman 
Brothers Band in concert at 8:30 
PM on October 15, 1971 at Syria 
Mosque. Reserved tickets are $2, 
$3, and $4. Tickets go on sale Fri
day, October 1.
I cannot finish this article with
out saying that at the concert I 
attended the audience was ecstat
ic. The thrill of the audience was 
unbelievable. The reason behind 
the audiences behavior was the 
fact that the Allman Brothers 
Band is made up of dedicated mu
sicians, who have spent years get
ting to where they are.
The Allman Brothers Band is a 
blues-rock n roll band that has a 
grasp of music, comparable to any 
popular group. Their musical so
phistication enables them to con
stantly search for new sounds 
which come from the exploratory 
nature of the band. The concentra
tion in which one listens to them if 
utterly fantastic.
The intensity of their music is 
superb. It has soul, mixed with the 
jiving sounds of today to create 
their own kind of music. All 
that is left to say is that their music 
is a brilliant creation. Truly amaz
ing music. Go see for yourself.

Films
This years Film Arts Society 
schedule is available at the Infor
mation Desk in Skibo. The selec
tion of films which the Society is 
presenting this year is a good one, 
both from the standpoint of the 
cinema buff and the individual 
who enjoys seeing revivals of solid
ly entertaining films without 
having to put up with an almost 
constant stream of commercials, 
station breaks, news flashes and 
public service announcements.
The only thing that detracts 
from this program of films is the 
Film Arts Societys insistence that 
one must either subscribe to the 
series for a semester or the entire 
year because no tickets will be of
fered for sale on an individual 
basis. Now since there are no 
doubt a number of persons such as 
this writer who wish to see several 
of the films, but who definitely 
will not have the time to see all of 
them, one wonders why the So
ciety doesnt offer a limited num
ber of single admission tickets to 
all of its presentations.
A semester ticket entitles its 
bearer to see every film shown
either in the fall or spring for a cost 
of approximately thirty-four cents 
a film. To put it mildly this is one 
helluva bargain when one con
siders the calibre of the presenta
tions. However, it is no real bargain 
to the person who is interested in 
seeing just one film, or even to the 
subscriber who wants to bring a 
date or friend along to see the pic
ture he has been talking about ever 
since he found out that it would be 
playing on campus.
Naturally, it is only fair that 
viewers such as those mentioned 
above be asked to pay more than 
those who take the package deal, 
and a price of anywhere from fifty 
cents to a dollar seems very reason
able to this writer.
Since the Society may not want 
to be bothered with the hassle of 
collecting money at the door, 
there is no reason why a limited 
number of advance tickets could 
not be placed on sale at the Infor
mation Desk. So that the Societys 
subscribers dont get crowded out 
of their own showings, a limited 
number of tickets could be made 
available to each showing, or all
the single tickets could be for the 
showing that is usually the most 
sparsely attended.
The result of allowing more 
people to see the presentations 
would no doubt mean increased 
revenue in the fall for the Society 
along with increased membership 
subscriptions in the spring, but 
would quite simply allow more 
students and faculty members to 
benefit from this seris.
The Film Arts Society should 
be commended for their efforts in 
bringing such a fine selection of 
films to the Carnegie-Mellon camAs this writer can attest, the set
ting up of such a series is no small 
undertaking. Everything from the 
scheduling of the hall to the rent
ing of films and finding someone 
to run the projectors requires a 
great deal of careful planning and a 
fantastic amount of patience. 
Since the society is obviously more 
than equal to the task, one won
ders why it doesnt want to open 
its doors to increase its income and 
let more people see what it is 
accomplishing.
(Note: To be sure to be able to gain 
the full impact of any record re
view, be sure to read the authori
tative review of the album in 
PLAYBOY magazine three

you will have bought the album 
and dont need a review. Maybe by 
that time you will have read this

that he is, holding a hog tight by

very similar to that of comrade 
McCartney and his ram on Pauls 
latest moneymaker. If one didnt 
know Lennon better, he might 
think the photo was not just coin
cidental. (The hog is feasting on 
peanuts.)
Enough for packaging. At any 
rate, that is not the only cut on 
McCartney presented in the al
bum. At first, the song How Can 
You Sleep? seems to be frank, 
forthright, and biting. Need I say 
that this selection attacks Paul 
with such lines as (no rights re
served for any of the following): 
Those freaks was right 
when they said you was dead 
The one mistake you made 
was in your head...
Think about Pauls line about 
mistakes in Too Many People. 
Onward.
The only thing you done was 
yesterday
And since youre gone 
youre just another day... 
Lennons put-downs of McCart
ney seem first to be an editorial 
appraising Pauls work since he left 
the Beatles. After hearing the re
marks repeatedly, however, one 
finds How Can You Sleep? in 
poor taste. Even the title suggests 
that John is trying to make Mc
Cartney feel guilt-for what it is 
not clear. Regardless of his feelings 
about Pauls sugary shift, the 12 
inch vinyl disc should not be made 
an arena for mudslinging. The 
statements he makes are not open, 
but sniggering. Lennon makes the 
sarcasm hurt-and. the listener 
wonders what Paul thinks of the 
song.
It is musically competent, one 
of the better songs on the album in
that respect. Harrison puts in a fine 
lead in this band, Klaus Voorman 
seems to be getting the bass down 
much better than in Johns last 
album, and Alan White adds a 
Ringoesque drum beat.
It shouldnt be played on top
40.
Of course, there is the title 
song, very available for airplay if 
Lennon releases it as a single. It 
already has become one of the fa
vorites of the chart-makers. What a 
cliche. It seems ironic that John 
can refer to a brotherhood of 
man in this song and flip over to 
accuse Paul of insomnia in How 
Do You Sleep? By now, most 
people regard John as a trifle 
wacked-out anyway. No more 
than the rest of us. John Lennon is 
just nicely inconsistent. Well, well, 
well.
The styles vary on this produc
tion. The addition of violins to 
some tracks greatly enhanced the 
soundthe record is a much more 
complete work than his first Plas
tic Ono Band album. He gets down 
to some harmless country honkytonk in Crippled Inside and Oh 
Yoko! You can decide for your
self whether Crippled is pro
found or not as he sings:
You can shine your shoes 
and wear a suit 
You can comb your hair and 
look quite cute 
You can hide your face be
hind a smile
One thing you cant hide is 
when youre crippled 
inside.
Oh Yoko! isnt as bad as the 
title sounds, so if youre expecting 
a poetic clunker, youll be sur
prised. Of course, if youre think
ing in terms of Strawberry 
Fields, forget it. Country drivel.
John achieves the quiet sound 
on Jealous Guy, Oh My Love 
and How? The strings are espe
cially well added in How?, the 
lyrics in the same vein as Love 
on his last album. The other two 
are nice, but not especially memor
able.
Its So Hard is so hard to 
comprehend. It is a blues song, 
with sharp electric guitar, round 
bass, and vocals from a 1937 78 
rpm record. And to add insult to 
this track, Phil Spector adds the 
usual unusual violins, which here 
dont qualify for the finals. Im
mediately following it is I Dont 
Wanna Be A Soldier Mama, six 
minutes which sound like the 
Apple Jam on All Things Must 
Pass, only with Johns tremen
dously echoed voice dubbed in. It 
isnt surprising-some of the same 
personnel is present: Klaus on 
bass, Harrison (he plays on five of 
the tracks on this album), and two 
members of Badfmger. It also fea
tures Mike Pinder of the Moody 
Blues on (!) tambourine, and King 
Curtis on some bizarre saxophone 
runs.
The best cut from the whole is 
necessarily Gimme Some Truth, 
which is very acceptable on both 
lyric and musical bases. The mel
ody is strengthened by George 
Harrisons guitar additions and 
superb lead (a small bit of Abbey 
Road here and there), making the 
song as a whole contageous. The 
words flow into each other almost 
in the manner of a Dylan protest, 
with Lennon spitting them out 
adequately. The song even says

This fall, when you and Sally Torque go to the big game with Purvis U., take along a copy of the October 
Issue of the National Lampoon. For the 75 cents you would have spent on a football program to find out 
that Billy Glefson, tight end for the Purveyors, hails from Mofongo, Indiana,, and majors in port construc
tion, youll have something to do during half time when the Asher B. Durand High School Large Drum and 
Aimless Marching Corps slides into John Philip Sousas Bataan Death March for the fourth time. Youll 
be reading a fifteen-page Mad parody; 125th Street, the educational TV show where those adorable 
Muthas, Big Rat and the Cocaine Monster, teach ghetto children their place; Magical Misery Tour, 
which records the Beatles trip to a land where all you need is a lawyer; The Final Seconds, a gridiron 
gripper starring those inseparable chums, Moose Nixon and Ruff Mitchell; and Right On!, the same 
campus war game played for years in army think tanks and radical encounter groups. And much more. The 
Back to S^ool issue of the National Lampoon is on sale at newsstands everywhere.

HOCKEY CLUB
The CMU hockey team this sea
son has something that will inter
est all sports fans on campus. After 
two seasons of scrimmaging sur
rounding teams and colleges, CMU 
has taken the initiative of organ
izing the Western Pennsylvania In
tercollegiate Hockey Club Associa
tion. CMLPs own Mr. Robert 
McCurdy is acting director and 
chief organizer of the league. Be
sides CMU, the other colleges in
volved are Pitt, Duquesne, St. 
Francis, St. Vincent, Penn State at 
McKeesport, and Indiana of Penn
sylvania.
So youre tired of seeing CMU 
being beaten in other sports by 
these schools, huh? And you get a 
little pissed off at CarnegieMellons second rate perfor
mances. Well, hockey offers an al
ternative, a winning alternative. 
But, Pitt will probably kill us, you 
say. Bull! The hockey rivalry be
tween CMU and Pitt has already 
been formed. And CMU can and 
will beat Pitt! You dont believe it? 
Well get off your lazy ass and come 
see us do it! CMLTs home ice is at 
the Alpine Ice Chalet in Edgewood, only fifteen minutes from 
campus. The hockey season is 
scheduled to begin the first week 
of November. The CMU campus 
will be well-informed on all dates 
and times of games.
Returning from last years line
up will be A1 Leff, Ken Ford, 
Pichai Sinpatanasakul, Rich Herlich, Rich Klobuchar, Russ Wescoe, Bill Bures, Jim Powers, and 
outstanding goalie Jeff Hart. But, 
the real reason for CMUs opti
mism this year is the number of 
new players who will be joining the 
team to add greater depth and 
scoring punch. And if there are any 
of you readers who would like to 
join the team and werent able to 
attend the meeting, just leave your 
name at the Skibo Information 
Desk.

Sports
Perhaps this season is not very 
much worse than others in terms 
of fan support; after seeing those 
who attended the football game on 
Saturday, I felt ill. Our team was 
holding its own on the field until a 
wild fourth quarter cost them the 
game.
Looking into the stands 
throughout the game, I saw over 
one-third filled by W and J fans 
who were yelling their lungs out 
encouraging their team. In con
trast, the rest of the stands were 
filled by totally apathetic fans, 
otherwise known as the CMU 
cheering sections. The only sup
port I saw for the Tartans was from 
our cheerleaders, who in vain triqd 
to rally support for our team 
throughout the game. In reply, the 
CMU bleachers almost fell asleep. I 
even saw people restraining others 
from cheering. The only spirit I 
saw from our side was more than 
forty assorted empty wine bottles 
and a variety of beer cans left be
hind; the greatest majority of 
which were found in the section 
most frequented by the CFPs. Not 
one bottle was found in the W & J
"SPIRITS BUT
section. In addition, it was a warm, 
balmy day.
Having seen all of this, I am 
wondering. Are our fraternities 
and sororities concerned with hel
ping the school out only when 
they can get the prize ribbon or 
have the attention focused on 
them? What has happened to those 
enthusiastic members of Spirit and 
the Commuter Club? Finally, 
where are the ordinary students 
and faculty hiding?
If we are ever going to have 
enjoyable events on this campus, 
everyone will have to give a little to 
make a good time for all. We have a 
good football team with no sup
port. Ask any of the players what 
school support means to them. 
Homecoming is in another few 
weeks. Talk is that there may be 
buses for fans to some of the away 
games before and after then. Sure
ly we can give our team more sup
port than they have now. If not, 
the mumbled words of one cheer
leader looking up at the stands will 
become reality as she said, Boy, it 
sure is going to be a long season. 
John Holobinko
N O SPIR IT"
SOCCER
As waning moments of last Sat
urday afternoon seemed to be pro
viding relief to the beaten inhabi
tants of Pitt Stadium and Skibo 
Bowl, twenty-five CMU students 
were experiencing the frustration 
of impending defeat. In Latrobe, 
the St. Vincent soccer team was 
beating CMU 1-0. Nevertheless, 
the game was by no means over. 
More than once, the offensive line, 
headed (pardon the pun) by Alan 
Koblin, looked as though they 
would tie the score. The defense 
fought exceptionally hard to pro
vide them with such opportunities. 
However, the lone score by St. 
Vincents 54 inside right proved 
in the long run to be the margin of 
victory. Indeed, the loss was espe
cially crushing because CMU had 
seemed to overcome its offensive 
problems last week after a few du
bious pre-season performances.
There was, however, far from 
an abundance of potential scoring
plays, as the offensive line appear
ed uncertain and unaggressive. The 
team, centered around a fellow 
named Moses, who can do just about anything but divide the Nile, 
also has last years starters Andre 
Orban, Jack Borisewitz, Alan Kob
lin, Bob Moroz, Joel Kneisley, Pe
ter Schuller, and Mike Smith (who 
turned in a superb effort) to help it 
get untracked next Saturday against Pitt. The rest of the team, 
headed by newcomer standouts 
Dan Streyle and Goran Bencic, in
cludes Hank Levy, Fred Yoshua, 
Nazir Sandeiji, John Sterm, Stan 
Smith, Pichai Sinpatanasakul, 
John Lape, Ken Kern, Russell Kalen, David Frey, Fred Ferry, David 
Gaudino, Bill Lombardo, and Jim 
Dadok. So far, the booters have 
not resorted to eating rocks, but 
may consider doing so if they can
not succeed in avenging a 2-1 loss 
suffered at the hands of Pitt last 
year. Game time this Saturday is 
1:30 PM. Peter Schuller
CROSS COUNTRY
The Carnegie-Mellon Cross 
Country team faces piles of trials 
... with smiles? Even with 25-31 
(low score wins) defeat from Beth
any last Saturday, there were out
standing achievements by CMlTs 
sophomore harriers. Ken Kloes 
shattered the school course record 
(set by Jon Manon in 1969) by five 
seconds with a 22:25, followed by 
Tony McKay who finished at 
22:58. This is the first time to pre
sent knowledge that CMU has had 
more than one runner finish the 
athenley course under the 23 min
ute mark. However, the lack of 
depth on CMU team coupled with 
the leg injury of co- captain Dennis 
Sullivan allowed a total of five 
white shirts to face the Bethany 
green. In spite of their efforts, this 
spelled defeat. Kloes and McKay 
took first and second followed by 
teammates Greg Hyatt, Dave Byers 
and Wayne Bingham in eighth, 
ninth and eleventh respectively.
The team will remain at home 
for this Saturdays competition against a tough rival, Grove City.

I. M. FOOTBALL
The IM football season is only 
one week old, and already weve 
seen some very important games; 
some races are already clearing up. 
The American League, with the 
upset victory of the Black Magics 
over Beta by 11 -10, has established 
the Black Magics as the definite 
favorite. Another surprise in this 
league is the emergence of Phi Kap 
as real football players. They bur
ied Sigma Nu 35-9. In other scores 
from the American League, a good 
DU team bested KECC 34-16, and 
the Sig Alphs rolled over Solid 
State, 33-10.
The National League had its on
ly major confrontation of the 
week postponed; GSIA-PIKA will 
play later. Pepper and Salt did not 
look as sharp as expected, but still 
rolled over Tau Delt 36-8. Pika 
stopped Beta Sig in a mudbath, 
39-11. ATO had problems moving, 
but theres no doubt with their 
defense: AT028, East Epileptics 
3. BTP B split two, losing to East 
Epileptics 10-6, and beating the 
Delts by forfeit.
The Intermediate Leagues have 
some amazingly good teams. The 
West should go to the Oakland As, 
victors over Reagent Men 27-2,
and Scrow, 37-15, Other Scores: 
SAE Derelicts 19-7 over 7E A, Ta
xi 1-0 over Scrow (forfeit), Taxi 
22-1 over 7E A, and Regent Men 
over SAE Derelicts, 26-14.
In the East, watch the Clackers 
and Nads. Scores here: Clackers 
10-8 over Blawnox, and 19-9 over 
Kappa Sig, Nads 15-1 over Phi 
Kap, Blawnox 19-6 over Oak B, 
Oak B over Shrinks 20-14, and the 
Shrinks over Phi Kap 15-9.
Thats it for this week. Theres 
some good games coming next 
week. Come see ATO vs. Pepper 
and Salt today at 6:00.

VARSITY FOOTBALL
Things dont look good for the 
Red. Much to everyones dismay, 
the Tartan dropped their second 
game of the season Saturday, 
losing to W & J by the over
whelming score of 42-27. But even 
more disappointing than the score 
was the showing made on the field. 
It seemed like nothing went right.
The early part of the game gave 
every indication of a high-scoring 
offensive battle. C-MU jumped off 
to an immediate 7-0 lead on a 60 
yard scoring pass from Rich 
Squires to Chuck Price. Juan Neffa 
added the point and it looked like 
C-MU was going to romp. But W & 
J took the kickoff and drove 
downfield to score on a broken 
play.
Lady Luck again turned against 
the Tartans whan, after being 
stopped on third down, they were 
forced to punt. The snap from cen
ter was low and Prices knee 
touched the ground as he scooped 
up the ball. The play was blown 
dead and the Presidents had the 
ball, deep in Tartan territory. Sec
onds later they scored, again work
ing against the defensive secon
dary. At the end of the first quar
ter, W&J led, 14-7
The Tartans, though were not 
out of it yet. They took the kickoff and drove 60 yards for the TD. 
Two passes to Brian Carlock 
sparked the score, a one-yard dash 
by Chris OLeary. Juans kick was 
wide, but the Tartans were only
down by one. Late in the half the 
C-MU team was again on the move 
when again a Prexy interception 
stopped them cold. At half time it 
was still 14-13.
The third quarter turned into a 
defensive battle with each side 
scoring once, C-MU on a 15 yard 
Squires to Carlock pass. Tom Lom
bardo was stopped just shy of the 
goal line on the try for the 2 point 
conversion and the quarter ended 
with the score: W&J 21,C-MU 19.
Then, suddenly, the roof fell in. 
W&J scored the next three times 
they had the ball, capitalizing on a 
combination on interceptions and 
fumble recoveries. Dan Kasperik, 
the W&J quarterback, had little 
trouble picking apart the secon
dary and eluding Tartan tackles. 
That made it 42-19 with only min
utes to play. The Tartans suc
ceeded in blocking a W&J punt at 
the 5 yard line late in the fourth 
quarter, and Ronnie Shinault ran it
in for 6 points, but time had just 
about run out for Big Red. Chris 
OLeary chalked up 2 more points 
on the conversion, so at the sound 
of the gun the final score was 
42-27, C-MU again at the short 
end.
No one was more disappointed 
than the players themselves, but 
no one has given up either. This 
weeks workout has been the most 
spirited yet, which is a good sign. 
Friday the team leaves for Oberlin, 
Ohio for Saturdays clash. It seems 
that this game will be a do-or-die 
event, but few of the Tartans have 
ever played on a losing team and 
none of them plan to start now.
Im 0 for 2 in the prediction 
column but I dont see how the 
Tartans can help but make a strong 
comeback. Their next home game 
is Homecoming and I cant help 
but believe that Big Red will be 
rolling once again by then.

Don Luee, the man who 
brought the infamous tiger 
cages of Vietnam to the eyes of 
the American public, and his IndoChina Mobile Education Project 
will be at CMU October 7,8, and 9. 
He will speak in the Wherret Room 
at 11:30 AM on Thursday, Octo
ber 7. His Indo-China Exhibit will 
be in Skibo Lobby Friday the 8th 
and Saturday the 9th.
Luce spent twelve years in Viet
nam and is fluent in both its lan
guage and culture. After nearly 
nine years as director of Interna
tional Voluntary Services in Viet
nam, he resigned in 1967. From
then until May, 1971 he worked as 
a research correspondent for the 
World Council of Churches, writ
ing about the war, the country and 
the people. He has also co
sponsored a book, Viet Nam: The 
Unheard Voices.
In May, 1971, his visa was with
drawn by the South Vietnamese 
Government for speical reasons. 
The WASHINGTON EVENING 
STAR of May 14, 1971 said The 
special reasons seem to be one: 
He knows too much.
Luce put together his IndoChina Exhibit to help tell what he 
knows. The Exhibit attempts to
portray universal and special as
pects of the Indo-China people 
through pictures, drawings, car
toons, art pieces, snapshots and 
films. It is not a display of atroci
ties. Scenes of war related inci
dents and problems share equal 
space with everyday life much as it 
has been for thousands of years.
Through his exhibit and speak
ing, Don Luce is attempting to in
crease American understanding of 
the people of Indo-China and Viet
nam in particular and to make it 
possible for Americans to em
pathize with Vietnamese prob
lems. He is also trying to convince
Americans that they share in the 
responsibility for what has hap
pened to Indo-China and her 
people and to the Americans who 
also have been subjected to the 
dilemma of serving in that 
country.

The Senate passed the compro
mise bill by a vote of 55-30 on 
Sept. 21. The House vote on Aug

Defense officials have said, un 
officially, that no more than
19.500 more men will be inducted 
for the rest of 1971. Along with 
the 88,000 that were inducted 
through June, that would total
107.500 for the year40,500 less 
than Defense Secretary Laird esti
mated earlier this yearand 36 
percent of the total 1968 in
ductions.
The lottery numbers called so 
far, plus an estimate at the rate of 
703 per birthdate for the rest of 
the year, suggests that the top 
number to be called will be 153, 
compared with 195 in 1970 which 
yielded 209,300. By June this year 
the top number was 125, com
pared with 170 last year.
