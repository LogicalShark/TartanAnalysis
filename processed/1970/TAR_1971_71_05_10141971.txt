also announced that on November 
26th, war veterans from any war 
whatsoever are invited to vigil and 
fast on the steps of their respective 
state capital buildings.
Ralph Moore, a graduate of 
Western Penitentiary, and organ
izer of Vibrations, an under
ground prison newspaper, des
cribed the gamut of Americas ills, 
and claimed all the causes to be 
apathy and ignorance.
The highlight of the evening 
was an impromptu speaker Frank 
Marshall, secretary of the United 
Auto Workers Local 1020. He Was 
asked to state his reasons for op
posing the Viet Nam war. He simply stated, 50,000 reasons50,000 Americans are dead for no 
reason. And if thats not enough 
reason, he said, theres at least a 
million more in both North and 
South Viet Nam. Theres also 130 
billion dollars worth of reason that 
would have been enough to pro
vide free education and a dignified 
old age for every person in this 
country. His concluding with, my 
11 year old son as a reason, drew 
a sympathetic round of applause.
Alice Scott, representative 
from the Welfare Organization of 
Allegheny County pointed out 
that many people who at one time 
believed welfare receipiants were
too lazy to work are now standing 
in line for food stamps and medical 
aid; that welfare does not drain the 
tax dollar, Viet Nam does; and if 
you are an out-of-state student 
you are not eligible for welfare in 
Pennsylvania.
The main speaker was John 
Froines, famous for his member
ship in the Chicago 7. Froines 
spoke of the upcoming fall offen
sive, October 22nd in Washington, 
where a peoples grand jury will be 
established to branch out to every 
community in the U.S., for the 
purpose of controlling our own 
fate.

veteran. His main proposal was for 
a truly American unhypocritical 
Thanksgiving Day of mourning, 
suggesting we relinquish our tur
keys and send our turkey-money 
to: The American Friends Service 
Committee, PO Box 935, Madison 
Square Station, N.Y., NY (and ear
mark it Thanksgiving Day). The 
money will go to the childrens 
hospital in Viet Nam where Ameri
cans are trying, a little late, to cor
rect some of our napalmings. Birch
The rally for justice, peace, and 
new priorities at the Soldiers and 
Sailors Memorial presented a full 
spectrum of speakers. From Fa
ther Augustus Taylor, who had the 
rally chant in unison, Pray God 
help us break mans chains so man 
can celebrate, to John Froines 
who presented it with a compli
cated yet plausible plan to evict 
Nixon from the White House.
The first speaker was John 
Birch, an ex-marine and Viet Nam
CMU Opens Child Care Center
A Child Care Center opened 
this semester to care for CMU stu
dent, faculty, staff, or alumni 
children between the ages of three 
and six.
Located in the former base
ment Recreation Room of Morewood Gardens, the Center is open 
from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM. The 
tuition is determined on a sliding 
scale.
The Center is presently con
cerned with developing an innova
tive educational program and is ex
perimenting with having parents 
assume the responsibility for mak
ing the Centers policy decisions. 
Sources for outside funds are being 
investigated to establish a demon
stration project for children be
tween two months and three years 
of age as part of the Child Care 
Center.
Attempts to start a Child Care
Center at CMU go back two years, 
when a sub-committee of the campu womens liberation group laid 
the groundwork. After the forma
tion of the womens organization 
know as the Women of Carnegie 
Mellon, the Child Care Committee 
was established.
As a result of this committees 
work, a proposal was written re
questing funds from the Welfare 
Department of the State of Penn
sylvania, and the Manpower Divi
sion of the Federal Labor Depart
ment. The people at the State level 
responded favorably, but accord
ing to State law, the money could 
only be appropriated to match 
other monies. When the Manpower 
Division in Washington refused to 
fund the project, the possibility of 
receiving State funds ceased.
The Child Care Committee of 
WCM then approached the admini
stration of Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity for support. On August 2nd 
a group of interested parents pre
sented a new proposal to Vice Pres
ident Schatz requesting rent-free 
use of the Morewood Recreation 
Room for day-care purposes, and a 
$20,000 subsidy for the Centers 
first year. Dr. Schatz said he had 
discussed the matter with Presi
dent Stever, and that they had de
cided to support the project.
During this same meeting the 
parent group brought up specific 
points mentioned by AWS and 
MDC in letters to Dr. Kibbee and 
Dean Swank concerning the Child 
Care Center. These letters were the 
outgrowth of several meetings last 
spring between members of the 
Child Care Committee and repre
sentatives of AWS and MDC.
At these meetings, the Com
mittee explained that the Morewood Recreation room was being 
requested from the students be
cause, after a tour of several pos
sible locations for the Center with 
a licensing person from the State 
of Pennsylvania, it was clear that 
the Recreation room was the only 
location that would be acceptable 
without extensive renovation.
AWS and MDC gave permission 
to the Child Care Center for the 
use of the Morewood Recreation 
Room provided that certain con
ditions were met: that the students 
would be provided with another 
recreation area; that substitute 
kitchen facilities be made available 
for the women in Morewood; and 
that the students would not hr 
to pay for the use of the rooms. To 
insure the last point the men stu
dents asked that the Center pay 
rent for the use of the Recreation 
Room.
In responding to these points. 
Dr. Schatz said he saw no reason 
why the blue room could not be
come the new recreation area as 
Dean Swank had already 
suggested. He also said he would 
discuss the addition of new kit
chen facilities with Mr. Ginovan, 
and saw no problem in setting up 
another kitchen for the women 
students.
But the parents expressed parti
cular concern about the third 
point. It was evident from calcula
tions that had already been made 
in preparing the proposal, that the 
Child Care Center could not hope 
to become self supporting unless 
he Recreation Room was donated 
rent free by the University. At the 
same time the parents, many of 
whom were students, felt that the 
students living in Morewood

Editor's Note
Last week, the Editor saw a film 
and was so impressed by it that he 
could be moved to write his Edi
tor's Note" on nothing but that 
film, regardless of how inappro
priate such a topic might be to this 
space.
From Italys politically exiled 
filmmaker Eniglio Pazzo, we have 
come to expect the unexpected. 
Since Entre Libre, his work has 
become so unpredictable in qual
ity and theme that many major 
American critics have come to dis
miss him as artistically inconsis
tent and undisciplined, and hardly 
a major director of our time.
I have continued to regard 
Pazzo as a creator of important 
cinema, in spite of other critics 
disdain for him, and after having 
viewed his latest film, Deux 
Heures de LAgonie, I am most 
certain that my great regard for his
talents has been undisputably justifed. For Deux Heures pos
sesses that always unexpected 
quality: greatness.
For some mysterious reason, 
Pazzos work has never enjoyed 
the popularity or exposure in this 
country that it enjoys in Europe. 
American audiences, with their 
great fondness for dialogue, per
haps find the absence of dialogue 
in Pazzos films disturbing. No 
doubt this has hurt his popularity 
here. Pazzo considers dialogue a 
corruption of the cinematic art. 
Film, he has stated, is a visual 
art. Sound is for radios.
Pazzo first won critical atten
tion in 1954 at Lourdes for his Le 
Grand Merde, a film remarkably 
reminiscent of the expressionistic 
German films of the 20sand 30s, 
and two years later scored his only 
popular success with Entre 
Libre, a masterpiece of serio
Letters
comic indignation.
Deux Heures is certain to 
bring Pazzo the lasting recognition 
which he most truly has deserved 
for some time. It was unanimously 
voted Outstanding Film at this 
years Zeebruge Film Festival 
(where one judge described it as 
an outstanding film) and re
cently received the Swedish Film 
Academys Elak Hinna Award.
Deux Heures is Pazzos first 
venture into neo-realism. He de
fines the neo-realist mode as a 
global description of reality 
through global consciousness. 
The simplicity of this philosophy 
is reflected in the unaffected 
nature of the film. Deux Heures, 
like all fine neo-realist work, 
creates a sense of mystery in the 
reality it presents. Death is inevit
able, Pazzo tells us, but some of us 
live longer than others.

Reply to Misitano
Editor, the TARTAN:
(In reply to Vince Misitanos letter 
which appeared October 8,1971.)
Woof.
Jean S. Beachley
Literary Editor for the Technical
Essay Contest
Editor, the TARTAN:
The October 7th TARTAN of
fers ten dollars for the deciphering 
of the statement, Who escalloped 
potatoes by Ike Eisenhower. 
Most probably, this is a random 
selection of words on the part of 
the editor, in order either to sneer 
at anyone who attempts a serious 
reply, or to elicit high quality wri
tings on intriguing topics.
Since the ten dollars is probably 
more closely tied to the second 
motive, I shall attempt to read into 
this statement all the relevance I 
can:
Escalloped is easily the most 
interesting word in the statement. 
It is given by Thorndike-Barnhart 
to mean (though used in past tense 
here) baked in a cream sauce or 
with bread crumbs. Immediately 
the entire passage becomes clear: 
Ike is returning from wherever old 
soldier go, to comment on ex-VP 
Nixons (Who?) wage-price freeze 
(bake, potatoes, with bread 
crumbs). The cream sauce repre
sents the smashing of the moral 
fiber of enterprising America into 
homogeneous pulp. Who escal
loped potatoesbut he may burn 
them, shortly.
Alex Riddel
Editor's Note: Irrelevant.
Editor, the TARTAN:
It is quite possible to take a 
literal interpretation of the state
ment Who escalloped potatoes by 
Ike Eisenhower. After careful 
cognitive consideration I have 
come to the conclusion that the 
answer to the aforesaid clause is 
Mamie. You dont believe it? 
Actually, its quite straight
forward.
Consider for a moment the 
Eisenhower kitchen with Mamie 
preparing a meal and Ike peeking 
in to see whats cooking. The 
solution becomes self-evident 
when you picture Mamie escalloping potatoes while Ike stands by 
watching, or thinking up a new 
book to write or whatever.
There, it was Mamie who es
calloped potatoes by Ike Eisen
hower. Quod erat demonstratum.

Puzzled by Blow Up
Editor, the TARTAN:
I recently saw Antonionis 
Blow Up. I saw it with the hope 
of being the first person ever to 
understand the film after only one 
viewing.
Well, I failed. I had heard so 
much about the film in recent 
years, that I felt well prepared to 
understand it. Not only did I fail to 
understand the film, I came to the 
realization while viewing it that I 
would never understand it. That is, 
unless someone explained it to me.
Knowing in advance that one 
should see Blow Up more than 
once, I strained my eyes and my 
ears trying to perceive every and 
any clue that would lead me to an 
understanding of the film. I 
thought for sure that the clue to 
understanding the film was in the 
blow ups of the murder. My eyes 
scanned the blow-ups intensely, 
but to no avail. I still think that 
that is where any understanding of 
the film must lie. The imaginary 
tennis game (or was it real?) blew 
my mind. I dont understand why 
that was the last scene. For that 
matter, I wouldnt understand that 
scene regardless of its sequence in 
the film.
The more I reflect upon Blow 
Up, the more I ask the question 
Why should I have to see a film 
two or three times to understand 
it? Why should anybody have to 
see a film more than once to under
stand it? I dont know, but maybe 
some films arent meant to be un
derstood. If Blow Up was an 
Antonioni masterpiece, Im won
dering what the hell a bad Anton
ioni is like. I myself would much 
rather watch a Steeler game or a 
Pirate game or a Penguin game.
Im not being facetious or sar
castic, but I would really like to 
know what Blow Up was all about. If anybody knows, please 
contact me through the TARTAN.

He brought up a well known 
statistic: 73% of the U.S. is against 
the war, yet the war goes on.
The fall offensive began in At
tica,  he said, and it wont end in 
Peking.
He stated that although the 
anti-war movement is guilty of ar
rogance and rhetoric, it must not 
be abandoned. It must gain humi
lity and broaden its concerns. We 
must become involved together, 
and go wherever an Attica is about 
to happen and say, No, you cant 
do this to us. We must recognize
that all the issues are inter-related.
The rally had begun with the 
unsynchronized coming together 
of four funeral marches. The can
dle light and black arm-bands cre
ated a somber atmosphere. It was 
not only a college-campus, anti
war event. The speeches covered 
all aspects of Americas problems, 
and of the four to five hundred 
people present only half were U. of 
Pittsburgh students. The rest were 
Viet Nam veterans against the war, 
veterans for peace, concerned citi
zens, and their children, many of
pre-school age.
It is unfair to accuse the stu
dents of CMU of being apathetic 
when there was so little publicity 
concerning this rally. But it should 
be kept in mind, to paraphrase 
John Froines, although we keep 
hearing the war is over; it is not 
over; it is merely becoming invisi
ble. Nixon is merely replacing 
troops with even more advanced 
technology. He is not winding 
down the war; he is winding down 
the anti-war movement.'

should not incur any additional ex
penses because of the Child Care 
Center. Dr. Schatz again saw no 
major difficulty. He knew that the 
Child Care Committee had been 
promised the use of Morewood Re
creation Room rent free, and said 
that the dormitory students would 
not incur any additional expense 
since all expenses would come out 
of the Universitys general opera
ting funds.
Following the assurances given 
at this meeting the parents mobil
ized and hired a qualified teacher,

Janice Malkoff, and two aides. The 
entire area was painted, basic equipment and furniture were pur
chased. The Center opened in a 
litttle over one month. In less than 
two weeks, the First group of fif
teen children enrolled, and enough 
people have applied to start the 
second group sometime in Octo
ber. Several student, both male 
and female, have volunteered to 
work with the children, and are 
planning to use the children as part 
of independent study projects. 
These projects must be approved
by the parents, the Centers Re
search Committee, and the Ethics 
Committee of the University.
A design class has made equip
ment for the Center for a class 
project and has come up with some 
highly original ideas for both in
doors and out. Janice Malkoff and 
the parents are now deciding 
which ideas they would like to see 
the design students work on.*

To convey this theme, Pazzo 
intentionally combines a prosaic 
European folk tale with a startling 
procession of powerful but subtle 
images. Human beings, for ex
ample, are used in the roles of the 
various characters, and as symbols 
of the finite nature of our exis
tence they are almost too poig
nant.
His leading man is again M. Gasgon, who turns in a most masterful 
performance as the homosexual 
entrepreneur torn between his bus
iness interests and his thirteen year 
old boyfriend. Especially moving 
is the brothel scene, in which Gasgon is confronted by a realization 
of his heterosexual tendancies.
I myself have too long felt the 
most desperate and deplorable 
lack of a dynamic and perceptive 
guiding force in the film arts, but 
with Deux Heures de L'Agonie, 
Eniglio Pazzo has assured me that 
there is at least one filmmaker to
day capable of firmly establishing 
the cinema as the prima art form
of this century and the future.
Unfortunately, the Film Barons 
oj this campus, Bill lacono, Prof. 
William J. McTaggert, and the 
Mens Dorm Council, do not agree 
with what Pazzo has to say (or how 
he says it), and are denying his 
\\\>rh access to this campus. The 
Film Barons arc not our Thought 
Police. Why hare they chosen to 
exclude Pazzo's work from all 
CMU film programs? / demand

following amendment to Fiscal 
Policy was passed:
 Any organization with a surplus 
at the end of the fiscal year must 
notify Student Senate and appear 
before the Finance Committee by 
November 1 lor a hearing about 
action to be taken on the surplus.
 It shall be up to the discretion
of the Finance Committee to de
cide what portion of a surplus an 
organization may retain, based on 
whether or not the organization 
has been acting in a financially res

centage of their total income is 
Student Senate money. After 
November I all surpluses will be 
assumed back into the Master Stu

ADRIFT belongs to that small 
class of films that everyone who is 
interested in films will be hearing 
about, but which very few will 
probably ever see. The reason for 
this is that this film wont last long 
in Pittsburgh for it is not the sort 
of picture that citizens of the Steel 
City are known for supporting. 
This is a sad situation because this 
film from Czechoslovakia is easily 
the best thing playing in town at 
the moment, and, in fact, is one of 
the best films which those of us 
who are permanently stranded 
here have had the opportunity to 
see this year.
Directed by Jan Kadar, who 
also directed THE SHOP ON 
MAIN STREET and the regret
table THE ANGEL LEVINE, 
ADRIFT is a visually beautiful, 
intellectually challenging film that 
keeps the viewer thoroughly en
thralled until its very end. Kadar 
has structured his work so that it 
can be interpreted on a variety of 
levels, and yet has not slighted any, 
but the most literal minded, of his 
viewers, for the richness and enjoy
ment that comes from watching an 
expert craftsman at work are avail
able on whatever level one chooses 
to view the film.
In the narrowest sense, 
ADRIFT is the story of a fisher
man and the consuming passion 
which he develops for Anada, a 
young lady whom he rescues from 
drowning in the Danube. His ob
session for her grows until, as he is 
about to murder his sick wife, 
Anada disappears, having sup
posedly drowned herself.
As one increases his field of 
vision, however, different and 
challenging facets of the story re
veal themselves and clamor for the 
viewers attention and examina
tion. One begins to mull over the 
ilm wondering about the identity 
of the three men who alternately 
question, tell, and listen to the 
fishermans story. Although they 
claim to be the three wise men 
(two are named Balthasar and Melchoir), they may also be something 
else, such as the fishermans con
science. Anada, the woman with
out a past or a future, rises from 
the sea, and is said to have returned 
to it, but does she exist at all out
side of the fishermans mind? If 
she doesnt, then what does she 
represent that he doesnt see in his 
wife? If Anada does exist, the audi
ence is challenged with attempting 
to discover why she is so cold to 
her surroundings, and why the 
fisherman continues to persue her 
inspite of her indiffernece. One 
also becomes concerned with the 
case of just who is adrift in the 
filmis it Anada, the fisherman, or 
maybe even all of humanity?
All of these questions, and pos
sibly far more are placed by Kadar 
into his film, and each is so subtly 
asked that the viewer is not over
whelmed and frustrated by them, 
but instead is given further incen
tive to pay closer attention to the 
film so that he may discover clues 
which will help him to conclude 
what he feels that Kadar is saying.
Kadar places these questions 
carefully into the structure of his 
picture, a structure so carefully 
constructed that it is magnificent. 
Kadars direction is present in 
every frame of his film, yet it is 
there so masterfully that the view
er is unaware of it unless he con
centrates very hard on looking for 
it.
Within the structure of his 
motion picture, Kadar is quite 
busy accomplishing a great deal. 
He is busy eliciting haunting, dis
turbing, excellent performances 
from his actors, who in his hands 
easily emerge from just flat charac
terizations into larger-than-life 
representations while still remain
ing entirely believable. As the fish
erman. Rade Markovic is excellent. 
Even through the handicap of sub
titles he is able to convey the 
emotions which are rendering his 
soul as he is torn between his pas
sion and jealously of Anada and his 
need to be faithful to his wife. 
Milena Dravic plays the wife of the 
fisherman. In her part she is ama
zingly convincing as she plays the 
difficult role of one who is naively
unaware of her husbands attrac
tion for the woman who has come 
to be her best friend. To a great 
extent, much of the success of the 
film depends on her, for had she 
been unable to keep her perfor
mance from falling into the stereo
typed idiot wife, the film would 
have lost much of its emotional 
impact. That she did indeed 
manage to make her character con
vincing and alive is to the credit of 
an excellent actress.
Paula Pritchett, an American, 
plays the haunting Anada with a 
grace of beauty and movement 
which serves to effectively accen
tuate and convey whatever is lost 
about her character in the trans
lation. Not being a raving beauty in 
the sex goddess classification is 
turned to a great advantage by Miss 
Pritchett who with Kadars superb 
direction has created a mysterious 
haunting screen character. It is 
amazing to note that ADRIFT 
marks Miss Pritchetts screen 
debut for her performance is hard
ly that of a beginner, but rather a 
polished veteran.
While making ADRIFT, Kadar 
was fortunate enough to have the 
assistance of cameraman Vladimir 
Novotny, for Novotnys lens gives 
Kadars work the exact feeling 
which it requires. His use of closeups is far from being mechanical, 
for he uses his cinematic eye to 
superbly capture just the right 
emotions in the facial expressions 
of his characters, thus seeing to it 
that every minute effort on the 
part of the actors is not wasted. 
Novotny is also a master in his use 
of lighting and shading, for every 
scene, even those photographed in 
bright sunlight, carries with it a 
look of eerie beautya look which 
exactly fits in with what Kadar is 
trying to achieve. Novotnys 
photography perfectly meshes 
with Kadars direction and the per
formances of the actorsand all 
three of these factors serve to 
make ADRIFT a piece of cine
matic excellence conceived and 
executed by a rare team of creative 
professional artists.

Oakland On $5 A Day
You have five bucks to spend 
today ... the deal for your dope 
didnt come through. Or maybe 
your mother sent you a Travelers 
Check. At any rate, its one of 
those days youd like to do some
thing besides avoiding listening to 
WRCT. This is the first installment 
of a guide which will give you, the 
bored student, insight into the 
amazing things available in the 
Oakland areaall for $5 a day or 
less.
Pinball Wizard: between Forbes 
and Fifth on Bouquet St. This cute 
establishment has an interesting 
history. The building used to be 
one of the original White Tower 
hamburger joints, and was on the 
site where the White Tower is
now, across the street from 
McDonalds. When the new White 
Tower was erected, the old build
ing was picked up and moved to its 
present location. (Still legible on 
the chimney is the inscription 
Hamburgers 15c in red block 
letters.) The ownership changed 
hands. Recently, Jakes News
stand occupied the building, but 
the only newspapers they sold 
were outside the door. Inside were 
nudes, not news. Anyone eighteen 
or over, or, realistically, anyone 
with six bucks, could walk in and 
peruse the nice magazines that 
were usually taped shut, or view 
the artistic posters of women 
assuming Y positions, or the closeups on glossy photo paper of 
interesting activities between conto recreate their last big sleep. Ex
ercises in dream analysis. Sleep is 
free, so is running. Then there is 
Frisbee. Theres always Frisbee. 
Go to Gus Millers Newsstand (not 
Jakes), buy a good Fris for $1.98 
and come back to Flagstaff to toss 
it. This leaves you with S3.02, 
enough to buy 6 packs of cigar
ettes and 2 pieces of gum. Oakland 
is great on money.
If you are REALLY interested 
in recreation, find a partner of the 
opposite sex, intersperse your
selves among the trees, and use no 
precautions. One of you will be 
recreating in a few months. It may 
wind up costing more than $5 a 
day, but whats more important, 
economics or sex? Try it and see.
Schenley Park can also be em
ployed for pure visual enjoyment, 
which is free. Enjoy watching the 
buses unload thousands of scream
ing kids into Phipps Conservatory 
on their big field trip of sixth 
grade. Enjoy watching the Pitts
burgh Police patrol the highways 
and byways of the park, looking 
for subversives. Enjoy watching 
Central High Schools track team 
trample your blanket as you at
tempt to read History of the 
Pelopponesian Wars while lying 
on your back with your Frisbee as 
pillow. Cost of book: $1.95 (ac
cording to the editor); cost of Fris
bee: $1.98. Total cost, $4.00, so 
you still have a buck to blow on a 
double order of raunch fries at the 
Tartan Grill.
senting parties. That was yester
day, though. The building is now a 
pinball closet, where five machines 
are put into a space smaller than 
the memory bank of the 360 in 
Science Hall. It is assumed that the 
proprietor not only doles out 
change but operates other enter
prises with his customers. Thus, if 
youre interested, take your five 
bucks to Jakes, change a dollar of 
it and play 12 games of pinball. 
You wont win any, so dont worry 
about it. Place the other four dol
lars in the attendants hand and 
place your bet. Go back to your 
room and listen to the radio to find 
the first 3 numbers of the total 
shares exchanged on Wall Street. 
Then realize you blew your 
money.
Schenley Park: to the south of 
Carnegie-Mellon University on 
Schenley Park Dr. For pure recrea
tion, this area of Oakland cannot 
be surpassed. You can recreate 
that last big stone you had as you 
smoke hash in the woods (hashish 
for $5 a gram will take up all the 
money.) You will be too zonked to 
eat food anyway. The problem 
here, however, is chancing ex
ceeding your $5 a day limit. A bust 
will undoubtedly cost you a few 
more dollars. If you arent inter
ested in the high side of life, you 
can always run on Flagstaff Hill 
and recreate that last great track 
meet you were in. Most people in 
Schenley Park, however, are there
C-MUsement Park: located in 
the heart of the Carnegie-Mellon 
campus, next to the stands in Tech 
Field. This is also known as Carj negie-Mellon Childrens School, a
ji misnomer at best. This recreation
al highlight is not just for little 
ones-it can provide enjoyment for 
kids aged 3 to 63 (excluding ages 
5-63). If you happen to be bored, 
walk over to this funspot and get 
ready for an exciting three min
utes. Rides galore! Beautiful land
scaped midway! Cotton candy!
All the above are true, except 
for the cotton candy. There is a 
sliding board there, a mini-monkey 
bar set, a Jungle Gym, and two 
structures that look like under
sized aqueduct conduits. And they 
expect children to be fascinated by 
it all. Actually, that equipment 
was there long before there was a 
childrens school. The Donner Hall

men bought the equipment from a 
local drive-in theatre for their per
sonal use as a study-break. Over 
the years, however, Donner Hall 
men studied less and less, thus 
needing no break. The frats took 
the equipment over, and on any 
day one could see an ATO brother 
frolicking in the C-MUsement 
Park. Now, everyone has aban
doned it. No one studies. This park 
still has great potential as a recrea
tional diversity, though. For less 
than $5, the adventurer can ride 
every single ride as long as he 
wants! I dont believe this has sunk 
into the student brain yet. How 
can any student sit with the 
C-MUsement Park near him, rea
lizing it costs nothing, yet passes 
up a great opportunity for fun?
There were even rumors that 
the C-MUsement Park would be 
expanded to include the follow
ing: a beach (the IM field), a lake 
(the football field), and new rides. 
Ideas for these rides are the Tilt-aWhirl (the slanted floors of Baker 
and Doherty Halls), the Tunnel of 
Steam (self-explanatory), and a 
new Fantasyland ride from C-MU 
to Mellon Institute. Also projected 
is using the Tartan Grill as an arena 
for a new bingo-like game called 
Skibo. If you cover a row, col
umn, or diagonal, you lose, and 
must eat a meal in the cafeteria.
This is just the first part of a 
series designed to help the average 
student through his leisure time. It 
is written by Craig Collins, noted 
authority in the field of wasting 
time, with photographs supplied 
by his Iriend and also-time-waster 
James McKee of Duquesne Universit\ (pictured in the C-MUsement 
Park).  Chilins

Sports
There was a time some thirty or 
forty years ago, when CarnegieMellon attached a great deal of 
importance to its athletic depart
ment. Back then, varsity sports 
were big time on this campus. 
Nowadays one can hardly mistake 
the lack of committment towards 
varsity sports from both the 
students and the Stever Ad
ministration.
Only 6% of the 2600 full day 
students participate in varsity 
sports compared to the more than 
60% who play for intramural 
teams. The obvious question, then, 
is why do students shun varsity 
sports in favor of intramurals? The 
advantages to playing on a varsity 
team seem so few that you really 
have to ask yourself: why does 
anyone go out for varsity sports at 
all? To begin with, very few stu
dents really care how well the 
teams do. Those who show up for 
games do so more because they
have nothing better to do, rather 
than because they are interested in 
the team.
Local papers pay little atten
tion to CMU sports except to make 
observations like this years foot
ball team is short on talent but 
long on hair. (Editors note: 
Could this be some fault in our 
Sports Information Department in 
Baker Hall?) Most important, the 
school belongs to no athletic con
ference and the teams have no real 
sense of competing for anything.
As for what committment the 
Stever Administration has made I 
doubt that anyone outside of the 
Administration itself thinks it has 
made any committment at all. It 
has been argued that building the 
new sports stadium a few years ago 
was a sign of committment. Per
haps it was, but for the last eight or 
nine years there has been an at
tempt to generate some action 
within the administration that it
would at least consider joining an 
inter-collegiate conference. Only 
recently has there been talk that 
possibly we enter a conference. 
(Editors note: Last years Athletic 
Board recommended that CMU 
join a conference, a proposal that 
since then has been shuffled 
around. What happened to it?)
Even worse is how long this uni
versity has put off the decision as 
to what place sports should oc
cupy on campus. There seems to 
be a fear among some people that 
by assigning a bigger role to varsity 
sports somehow academic stand
ards would suffer. No one wants to 
see sports commercialized. No one 
wants to see Carnegie-Mellon go 
big time. A students academic 
standing must always be the first 
consideration, says Raymond E. 
Haynes, Director of Physical Edu
cation and Athletics. But ac
cording to Robert McCurdy, Di
rector of the Alumni Association,
there is no reason why the 30,000 
some alumni across the country 
could not locate prospective stu
dents able to meet the academic 
requirements and who can also 
play ball.
Raymond Haynes became Di
rector of Physical Education and 
Athletics when the two depart
ments were merged in 1966. He 
feels very strongly about the need 
to assign a proper role to athletics 
in the campus community. Either 
we should consider athletics a sig
nificant part of this campus or we 
should eliminate it. But he 
doesnt believe athletics should be 
too strongly stressed. In the total 
educational program academic 
standing should come first. For 
that reason he supports the posi
tion taken by the Doherty Admini
stration in the late 30s to deemphasize sports. I dont think 
anyone on this campusnot the 
coaches, not the student, certainly
not mewants to see CarnegieMellon go big time. All I want is for 
us to be able to play schools com
parable to us both academically 
and in athletic ability. He would 
like to see Carnegie-Mellon join 
some athletic conference, whether 
it be the NCAA or the PAC.
What will come of this will 
probably be determined by any 
. action taken by the Atheltic Board 
(which hasnt met this year) with 
any influence they can assert to 
getting the Administration on its 
toes, or off its ass. The whole sad 
story can be summed up in Coach 
Meckleys statement, we have a 
cross country runner by the name 
of McKay. I think he could be one 
or two in the NCAA. But we arent 
members, so he doesnt qualify.

Perhaps Homecoming can in
spire the CMU Tartans to find the 
winning combination when they 
take on Allegheny College this Sa
turday, Oct. 16. Game time is 1:30 
PM.
Against Kenyon College last Sa
turday the Tartans saw another 
game get out of reach in the second 
half with the Kenyon Lords outscoring the Tartans 21-6 in the se
cond half to win 39-19. CMU is 
now 1-3. Allegheny is 3-1 on the 
strength of a 21-0 defeat of Oberlin last week.
Game statistics showed Kenyon 
dominating on the ground and in 
the air, with the Lords outrushing 
the Tartans in the second half 194 
to 58 yards. Kenyon freshman full
back Joe Szmania ran through the 
Plaid defenders for 186 yards and 
four touchdowns while junior 
quarterback Dan Handel picked apart the CMU defensive secondary, 
completing 14 of 22 passes for 218 
yards and two TDs. Only in the 
shutout of Oberlin the previous 
week has the CMU defense lived up 
to preseason expectations. In the 
other three games the Tartan de
fense yielded a total of 107 points.
Although CMU is averaging 
some 25 points per game for a total 
of 101 points, several TDs have 
come via defense and the offense, 
called explosive at the beginning 
of the season, has been inconsis
tent and unconvincing. Terry Bell 
and Tom Lombardo continued to 
pound out yardage, getting 83 and 
56 yards respectively against Ken
yon, but senior quarterback Richie 
for 77 yards and one TD, with two 
interception. After the second 
quarter the Tartans didnt score 
until second-string quarterback 
Jim Allera (Kiski Area) came in 
with eight minutes left in the game 
and threw five straight comple
tions, the final one a 26-yard sco
ring strike to junior running back
Chris OLeary (Wilkinsburg). The 
Kenyon defense was touted to be 
tough and they were.
The CMU offense will probably 
have its work cut out for it again 
this week against Allegheny. In 
four games the Gator defenders 
havent given up a TD on the 
ground and in fact have given up 
only four TDs altogether, the four 
coming in their only loss, 28-12, to 
W & J and its outstanding quarter
back Don Kasperik. The only 
other touchdown scored against 
Allegheny was by the CaseWestern Reserve defense, a game 
the Gators won 21-7. The Alle
gheny defense, which has yielded 
just 86 yards per game rushing, 
features a pair of defensive ends 
who must be the smallest in the 
country. The flea on the left 
side will be Mark Leous, a 56, 
140 pound sophomore, and the 
tick on the right side will be 
sophomore Kevin Donlon, 57 
and 145 pounds.
Twenty freshmen are on the 
Gator roster and six have made the 
starting lineup, including quarter
back Robyn Small, whos com
pleted 13 of 40 passes, for 127 
yards and one TD. Hes also carried 
for 199 yards and two more touch
downs. His leading receiver is 
Beaver Falls sophomore Jeff 
Carroll. The Gators leading rusher 
is veteran halfback Dale Hahn with 
252 yards. Both are averaging 4.3 
yards per carry. The Gators are 
light and fast.
Saturdays game will be the 
15th between the schools in a ri
valry dating back to 1906. CMUs
14-15 victory last year gave them 
10 wins against five losses in the 
series. In the last four years the 
two teams have scored a total of 
285 points, an average of 71 points 
per game. 
IM Football
The IM Football races are all 
but over. most teams, its on to 
soccer. But a few good teams, and 
a few hopefuls, are looking fo
rward to October 27th, when the 
playoffs are scheduled to start.
The American League should 
be represented by the Black 
Magics. They roared over the Sig 
Alphs, 35-10, to establish them
selves as the only unbeaten team in 
the league. Barring any upsets, 
theyll end up first in the League. 
Second place will go to the winner 
of next Tuesdays SAE-BTPgame
The National League should go 
to the winner of this weeks Pepper 
and Salt-Pika game. This will be a 
really tough game, with lots of 
action. Second place should go to 
the losers of that game, unless 
ATO can upset Pika next Thurs
day.
The Western Intermediate be
longs to the Oakland As, with 
Taxi pegged as second place. The 
Eastern should end up with Clackers and Kappa Sit at the top.
Interest in this years football 
season has been high, with the ad
vent of stronger leagues making for 
many more closely fought games. 
And the playoffs this year should 
be truly representative of the best 
in IM. So come out and support 
your favorites.
Note: Much to this writers con
sternation, it was learned late this 
evening that the No. 2 Black 
Magics were upset by the unranked 
Sigma Nus by 41-36. But Im not 
rewriting the article for anyone.I
