Play by Ed Hunt 41 
To Be Produced Here
Completed Manuscript Required 
Two Years of Intensive Work
By Art Hirsch
Rehearsals for Techs Drama Departments first show of the 
second semester have gotten under way with the casting of Ed
ward Hunts original No More Marriages. Hunt, a junior 
in the drama department, lias based his story on the lives of 
a group of actors and show people living in and around a Bucks 
County estate in eastern Pennsylvania.
Hunt completed the script after two years of work and 
the show is now approaching its premiere performance. Con
cerned with the .activities' of Barry and Catherine Lockwood^ 
the script presents many comic sequences from the first rising 
curtain. Typical theatre people apear all through the show. 
As an old timer, Temple Sweene3r makes her appearance in an 
attempt to straighthen out the lives of the Lockwoods. A triple 
triangular-love affair involves not only Barry and Catherine, 
but a young juvenile of a neighboring summer playhouse, Ellis, 
and a young ingenue, Lilly Winters.
In addition to these characters appearing in the gag-splat
tered script, comic interest is added with the appearance of 
Jenkins, the Lockwoods staid butler, and Gizelda, the maid who 
are also involved in the weird love mess. A telephone lineman, 
a taxi driver and a crook complete the cast.
Mr. Hunt has written some one act plays, but this is his 
first major venture into the plavwriting field. The production 
was originally entitled Stay in My Arms but the present title, 
No More Marriages is the present working title, and still is 
subject, to change b.y the author. He has placed his characters 
in a modern setting in the spacious living room of the Lock
woods home in Bucks County.
He has interspersed his script with many comic situations 
and gags, and the general style may put the play into the mod
ern drawing-room comedy classification. He is acting as as
sistant director to Professor McLean on the production.
The play will have its premiere performance on February 
16th in the Little Theatre in the Fine Arts building. It will run 
for the usual seven evening performances and one matinee and 
the added interest in the new play should bring a great demand 
for tickets.
The castings at the present time include: Cort Steen 40 and 
Willard Scott 40 as Barry. Playing the part of Iris wife, Cath
erine, will be Marcelle Feiner 40 and Marjorie McCann 40. Ester 
Jane Coryell 41 and Elizabeth Root 42 .are portraying the .role of. 
Temple Sweeney^ while Virginia Sinclair 40 and Jean Osterliolt 
41 are playing the7 part of Lilly Winters. William E.vtli 41 
and Herbert Browar .41 will be seen as Ellis, and Charles Kalis'll 
40 as the telephone lineman. John Blankenship 41 and Grey 
Lockwood 40 will be playing Jenkins, the butler, and Jane Robi son 42 and Jean Grant 42 are double cast as Gizelda, the 
maid. Art Hirsch 42 will play the taxi driver.
Marriage Course Ends 
Successful First Term
Committee of Four Boys and Girls 
Adds Democratic Aspect to Class
What is the marriage course like? Do you learn any
thing about. budgeting? Who really is the man of the fam
ily, the - husband or wife? are some of the questions 
asked students who are taking the course in 'Marriage and 
Family Relations, now completing its first semester on campus, 
it is interesting to note that, as far as can be ascertained, 
Carnegie Tech is the only technical school in the country which 
offers a course in marriage.
This course boasts two outstanding and attractive feat
ures. One is that each class has its own executive committee. 
This committee is composed, of four members, two boys and 
two girls, who are ele.cted to their positions. An effort is 
made to have each member of the committee represent one of 
the different departments on the campus. In this way, we are 
"kept open-minded and have the refreshing outlook offered by 
different viewpoints. This committee plan is more of a demo
cratic idea and has been found to help the other students. The 
committee garners the consensus of student opinions, decides 
issues which arise, and has the students submit questions to 
them which are in turn submitted to the instructor and are 
eventually brought up before the class, so that everyone may 
benefit from hearing the questions answered.
Another factor which aids tile course is t he conference 
method of study. Mr. Risedorph, the instructor, and Mrs. Risedorph, who is an interested helper; have been so kind and 
gracious as to set. aside a room, which is the study in their 
home, for,the use of the students. Here, in pleasant surround
ings, one (may come and go freely several afternoons of 1 he 
week. All the necessary reference books on the subject are 
to be found there. That is the place where term papers are 
wrrtten hd reading is done for book reports. Since the room 
is set apal-t a bit from the.rest of the house, the student maj
or may not come in contact with Mr. and Mrs. Risedorph. If 
he wishes j to come in quietly, study an hour or so, then leave 
without saying a word to anyone, he may do so; or if he wishes 
to ask questions about something which luis been puzzling him 
he may find imperonal yet interested assistance. During the 
.semester, the Risedorplis have invited the class in for tea 011 
several Sunday afternoons! These viere pleasant, informal oc
casions With interesting discussions, providing a chance for 
acquaintance with others.
Those who arent taking the marriage course, and who have
become curious, might like to know that the subject is ap1)r'iached fivom the sociological, biological, economical and1 psyciij "^^'i'Astand-point, Occasionally outside speakers ar

A1 Donohue 
Will Play 
For Prom
Paula Kelly Is 
Featured Singer
Consistent with their efforts to 
procure a top notch band for the 
Junior Prom the Delta Skulls have 
signed A1 Donohue and his Or
chestra, exponents of Low Down 
Rhythm. Coincident with the 
signing of the band the committee 
under the direction of Robert 
Deans 41 has begun to formulate 
plans to make this a different 
Prom from those of previous years.
The Hotel Schenley Ball Room 
has been selected for the prom 
and dancing will last from 9-1 on 
the night of February 9. To still 
further assure an outstanding af
fair, Student Council is fully back
ing it and will assist in the pro
motion and sale of tickets.
A feature of the evening will 
be the crowning of a Snow Queen. 
The Queen will be elected from 
a group of candidates chosen from 
the junior class. The entire motif 
of the prom will be centered 
around the queen and her regal 
snowy background.
In addition to his regular band 
A1 Donohue will bring with him 
lovely Paula Kelly whose charm 
and voice rate her high among 
modern blues singers. Phil Brito 
will also be featured singing fa
vorite songs. Charlie Carroll, 
Mickey Mouse of the Drums and 
Mickey Cielo, Clown Prince of the 
Trumpet will provide the fun and 
laughs of the evening.
A fine concert violinist, A1 
Donohue is also an outstanding ar
ranger and composer. Lifted 
among his contributions to popular 
music are Dont Cross Your 
Fingers, Cross Your Heart, 
Sweet Sorrow, and a new one 
called Do Ya Wanna Jump Chillun.
A1 Donohue is alone responsible 
for the ruling which makes the 
playing of the Star Spangled Ban
ner mandatory at the close of 
each days activities of radio sta
tions. He picked up the idea while 
touring Bermuda.

To Be Built 
On Campus
Plans Provide 
Novel Features
Plans for the Campus House ,to 
be built between the cut and 
Whitfield Hall near Forbes Street 
are nearing completion. The house 
was planned for a hypothetical 
average American family con
sisting of parents and two chil
dren.
In order to make the house 
more real and belter suited to 
such an average family inventor 
ies of family possessions were 
assembled. There are more than 
30,000 items owned and more or 
less treasured by United States 
families of normal living stand
ard. These items range from pie 
pans to automobiles, and include 
wearing apparel, food, cooking 
utensils, furniture, books, and so 
on. The purpose of such an in 
ventory was to aid in providing 
storage space within the house.
What the average American 
family does in the way of rec
reationentertaining within the 
home, habits of card playing, re 
laxation, sleeping, standards of 
cleanliness, the preparation of 
foodall contribute to how the 
house should be planned.
Novel features include: Ply
wood floors, heat insulating glass, 
ventilation by industrially pro
duced ventilators and not by win
dows, interior walls with phenolic 
resin surface in color that resuires no painting or upkeep, 
floors with base of sponge rub
ber for quiet walking, fiourescent 
lighting, and closets and storage 
rooms intended to give organized 
and systematic storage space for 
all the belongings of a family.
The value of the house to Car
negie lies in the opportunity af
forded for architects and others 
to try out approved new thought 
:n home planning and construcion. The house will be occupied 
apon completion by a cross-secion family. It is then that stu
dents of home economics, of 
rchitecture, students taking work

racticability of design of this

Contrary to the impression

When a student brings a book 
to the exchange he fills out a 
card with his name, telephone 
number, the name of the book, 
and the price he expects. In re
turn, he is given a receipt. On 
later presentation of this receipt, 
he is given his money if his book

is returned to him, and he is 
charged nothing for the handling 
of it.

Although the 1939-40 football 
year ended in a blaze of bowl 
battles that drew more cash cus
tomers than ever before, thesea
son just closed will not be fa
mous for its spectacular plays or 
players. Rather it will go down 
in the record books as the year 
of the big unfinished debate: To 
pay or not to pay?
Spotlighted into national prom
inence by the dramatic decision 
of the University of Chicago to 
discontinue intercollegiate foot
ball, the old question of subsidiza
tion of gridiron players was more 
vigorously discussed and more 
definitely acted upon than in any 
other year since the advent of 
big-time, highly-publicized pig
skin encounters.
It all began with the disastrous 
point-a-minute losses of the Chi
cago team, a team that took beat
ing after beating in Big Ten com
petition, much to the chagrin of 
Maroon fans. The fans, aided and 
abetted by sports writers in all 
sections of the nation, began the 
clamor for alumni funds to aid 
in securing hot-shot gridmen.
Then came the bombshell an
nouncement of the Chicago board 
of trustees, which said in part: 
The university believes in ath
letics and in a comprehensive pro
gram ot physical education for all 
students. It believes its particu
lar interests and conditions are 
such that its students now derive 
no special benefit from intercol
legiate football. The university 
looks upon all sports as games 
which are conducted under its 
auspices for the recreation of the 
students. The university will conj tinue to promote intramural sports
and will encourage all students to 
participate in them.
With this announcement, Chi
cago authorities cancelled all foot
ball games scheduled for the fu
ture and asked Big Ten authori
ties to allow it to continue inter
collegiate participation in the 11 
other sports sponsored by it. It 
is expected that the Big Tens 
answer to the Chicago proposal 
will be made in the near future.
Meanwhile, with less fanfare 
and less comment from the columning quarterbacks, Loyola Uni
versity of New Orleans calmly an
nounced that it is discontinuing 
inter-collegiate football so that the 
large sums of money spent an
nually on football can be spent 
on educational expansion.
On other fronts, too, subsidiza
tion was a large topic of discus
sion. At a meeting of the Col
lege Physical Education Associa
tion, Prof. L. C. Boles of College 
of Wooster urged his colleagues 
not to allow collegiate physical 
education to become a field for j 
men of very limited mental ca
pacity to continue in college for j 
the sole purpose of playing on i 
teams.
At the University of Pittsburgh, ! 
famed for its great football teams j 
and^for its recurring subsidization debates, Pre^-. John G. Bow! 
man asserted that recent sports : 
o staff upheavals at Pitt wore made | 
I because we want most of all that i

Evans Retires 
From Active 
ROTC Duties
Post To Be Filled 
By Sergeant Cullmn
Sergeant Walter M. Evans has 
retired after serving In the army 
for thirty years, twenty of which 
were spent at Carnegie. Sergeant 
Evans has left active service and 
is now on pension. Ills plans for 
the future are indefinite, but the 
fact that he ran for mayor in 
Washington, Pa., in the last elec
tion and is head of the Temper
ance Union of that city seems to 
indicate that his life will be far 
from an inactive one. I-Ie was 
the only active master sergeant in 
the Third Corps Area on R. O. 
T. C. duty.
Sergeant Evans position is now 
being filled by Sergeant Theodore 
J. Collum from Clarkson College. 
Sergeant Collum graduated from 
RUshylvania High School in the 
class of 1929, was sent to Ft. Belvior, Va., and then to Clarkson 
College in Pottsdam, N. Y., where 
he was an instructor in military 
courses. He has been in the Army 
for five years.
During his stay at Ft. Belvior 
he was selected to serve as honor 
guard at the Tomb of the Un
known Soldier. He graduated 
from the Belvior School of Sur
veying and Drafting and was a 
member of Company C, 5th En
gineers.
At his previous post, Sergeant 
Collum was instructor in rifle 
marksmanship and coach of the 
rifle team for two years. Accord
ing to his letter of introduction, 
from Clarkson College, he was 
very successful in producing win
ning teams.
Sergeant Collums position here 
will be that of Chief Clerk of the 
Military Department.

of the committee will be presented 
to Student Council for approval in 
the form of a revised budget for

in honor of Professor Leeds, who 
i;; going to retire at the end of 
this semester.
Refreshments will be served 
during the early part of the ev
ening. After this fellowship per
iod is over the group will be en
tertained by a magician for about 
a half hour. Later in the even
ing Professor Leeds will address 
the group.
Since this affair is in honor of 
Professor Leeds, who was a great 
friend and advisor to the under
graduate'student body and to the 
alumni, it is expected that a great 
number will attend. Already 
many replys have been received 
from friends who intend to come.

Unfinished Business
(By which means the editor checks up on 
the unfinished editorial business of the first 
semester.)
The International SituationDespite all that, 
the TARTAN could do or say they are still 
fighting in Europe. (We learn this from 
usually reliable sources in Helsinki.) But at 
least the United States has so far stayed out. 
The TARTAN modestly disclaims entire 
credit for this.
President Dohertys Assemblies-Dr. Doherty 
agreed to address two assemblies a year. 
Student Council was to set the dates. They 
failed to do so, undoubtedly because of the 
time strain caused by the creation of the 
Committee to Arouse School Spirit.
Forbes Traffic HazardLost someplace. 
Student-Faculty CommitteeFaculty couldnt 
agree on which was the most important 
phase in the background of war; psychology, 
history, or economics. Student members are 
giving them time to figure it out. Well 
transfer the problem to next years editor.

Headline Review
More Battleships and Taxes 
President Roosevelt lias recommended Congres
sional appropriations of $1,800,000,00032 per cent 
of the total 1940-41 budgetfor naval and military 
purposes. To avoid exceeding the statutory debt 
limit of $45,000,000,000, he suggested that Congress 
devise new taxes to meet military expenses. The 
new appropriation would provide for increasing 
present navy strength by 25 per cent.
Dopesheet On Courses
Russia Waterway
To supplement the impossible railway transport 
in Russia, Moscow has announced a plan to link 
the oil and wheat fields of the Ukraine with the 
newly acquired German port of Danzig by water. 
This project involves the building of a canal to 
complete the all water route from the Black to 
the Baltic Sea. The announcement is interpreted 
as an answer to rumors that the friendship be
tween the two countries is weakening.
Balance of Power, Or How 
We Entered the Next War
TN 1887 England formed two interesting treaties. One was formed with Germany and 
Italy, distinctly intended to throw a balance 
of power against' France, her continental rival 
since 1689. The other was with Austria-Hun
gary and Italy, throwing a balance of power 
against Russia, her eastern rival. In 1887 Eng
land formed treaties with her 1914 enemies 
against her 19/14 friends.
Why? The answer also explains why Eng
land throughout her history, has-fought Hol
land. Spain, Russia, France and Germany. She 
has fought them at the same moment in the 
history of eachjust at that moment when fur
ther expansion by that nation would mean a 
serious threat to English dominance of world 
trade and power.
In 1871 Bismarck completed the political 
unification of Germany. By 1887 Germany was 
a strong and growing nation; strong enough 
to make a good ally, but weak enough not to 
make a serious enemy. But by 1904 it was 
Germany and not France that was the thorn 
in Englands side. Germany was now threat
ening Englands trade dominanceon the 
North Sea. coasts and to the east. Germany 
had also expanded to the south and her mer
chants annoyed France in Morrocco. The Bag
dad railway began to worry the Russians. The 
result was a treaty in 1904 with France direct
ed against Germany. And another treaty in 
1907 with Russia directed against Germany. 
Divided^ Europe begau to arm in those days 
.and the. result was the World War which has 
been called the .result of Germanys  aggres
sion. At that time America, for some un*canny reason, also went in to stop the Hun.
After the war came the Versailles Treaty in 
which England and France made supreme ef
forts to subjugate Germany. But the war had 
crushed Germany and had made France the 
strong military power in central l^urope. Ger
many defaulted on the impossible reparations 
payments, and Poincare said, Whatever hap
pens I hall advance into the Ruhr on January 
15. He advanced. England began to fear 
a French-favored balance of power in Europe, 
and a strong pro-German feeling existed in 
England at this time. England went to work 
on the United States and the result was the 
Dawes plan which gave the French people 
(who were by now ^fraid of isolation from her 
former allies) an opportunity to retreat grace
fully. American participation in the League 
on the question of French evacuation of the 
Ruhr was the balance that finally decided the 
action of France, for Poincare was ousted and 
France evacuated the Ruhr.
Germany is strong once again, and power 
politics is once more at work in Europe. We 
hear that England again expects every Amer
ican to do his duty when the time comes. We 
have already started step one by the cash-andcarry plan which strongly favors the Allies. 
When the danger of the Hun (Nazi ... or for 
other reasons; the Reds) again clouds John 
Bulls brow, we transplanted Europeans 
will again, mysteriously, find ourselves plan
ning step number two.
And that is how the United States entered 
the next war.

Strike Threat
An inmmediate result of the recent mine disaster 
is the threat that 6,000 Illinois miners will strike 
unless operators end the practice of shooting coal 
setting off the explosive chargeswhile miners 
are working in the pits. According to the union, 
the dangerous practice is a violation of the state 
mining code.

Anti-Lynching Bill
Representative Gavagan of, New York has intro
duced the annual anti-lynching bill. Natural re
luctance on the part of congressmen to take a def
inite stand on the question and a threat of fillibuster from several southern Senators have con
vinced observers that the bill will join its prede

Profile
His friends call him Juice or Gene but the 
majority of students know him only as number 38 
on the football team: so we are formally introduc
ing Genial Gene Musial. Hes played football here 
for four years, 
three of them 
on the varsity 
squad. Gene 
received his 
biggest football 
thrill back in 
'36 when Harpster put him in 
his first game 
against N o t r e 
Dame as a 
guard. A year 
later this same 
team supplied 
him -with his 
biggest laugh. 
During the en
tire game the 
Irish guard and 
Gene had been 
waging a priGENE HUSIAL vate feud. As
the final whistle blew this worthy punched our 
hero and in turn Gene socked him back. It was all 
very funny especially since we won 9-7. That 
guaid should have known better than to tangle 
with Gene because hes a wrestler too.
A former trumpet player and jitterburg Genes 
beginning to take it easier but his friends claim
-that he cuts as many carpets now as ever. He
likes Wayne King and Hal Kemp, spaghetti, hand
ball, hunting ,and printing. And his roommate 
added that he doesnt like Guy Lumbago either.
Gene is bothered with two big problems in life: 
How to tactfully force women to remove their hats 
in theatersand how to effectively prevent his room
mate from eating all the Kielbasi that his folks 
send him from Vandergrift.
With regard to girls. Gene merely pointed to a 
lovely picture on his radio. . . . nuff said.
In the future Gene would like to see the dorms 
sponsor more social affairs such as dances and 
dorm parties. As President of the Dorm Council, 
Gene has taken an active interest in the proper 
regulation of Plebe Trials and he guarantees that 
Senior Ducking will not be the uncontrollable riot 
that it was last year.

Lets listen to the advice of a very bright young 
man now working in a chemical factory. He has 
written that one of the first things he learned after 
graduation was to keep his health.
High on the must list of employers, too, is good 
health. On an employment application blank, one 
of the very first questions is how is your health? 
And if the answer is not satisfactory, the applicant 
may as well go no further. Nor is his word 
enough sometimes. An increasing number of large 
stores .and factories give every applicant a thorough 
physical examination, and if he is not up to their 
particular set of health specifications, he is rejected 
as unfit.
Because it may be too late when the question is 
asked - and the examination given, undergraduates 
must learn that none of us have any claim on 
health, happiness or anything else unless we pay 
the price and meet the conditions on which they 
rest.
Rabbi Rothschild will speak, to the Womens 
Christian Association at a discussion meeting 
Wednesday, January 14, . at 4:30 o'clock in the 
Carnegie Union. A buffet supper will be served 
after the discussion to thosewho have made res 
ervations. All girls are invited to the meeting.
Religion in Personal Living is the theme chosen 
for the Religious Emphasis Week to be held on 
the campus from February 12-20. Two prominent 
out-of-town speakers will conduct discussions, and 
local ministers are going to speak to fraternities and 
other groups in private sessions. Various organiza
tions will sponsor the open discussion meetings.
A freshman Christian Association cabinet will be 
formed at the beginning of the new semester. 
Freshmen men students who are interested in the 
work of the C. M .C. A. should contact members 
of the cabinet or Mr. Davis.
On Saturday evening, February 10, the Jewish 
Student Council will sponsor a reception and 
dance at the Y. M. & W. H. A., Bellefield Avenue, 
for Jewish students of Tech, Pitt, Duquesne, and 
P. C. W. A large attendance is anticipated.

11-5Prof. Kiscdorph
Outside reading. Book reports. 
Term paper. No final exam. First 
semester was successful although 
some students mistook this course 
for comparative anatomy. It is 
presented from a sociological 
point of view, more than usual 
facts of life stuff and will prob
ably be broadened when some 
Margaret Morrison instructors 
can see it our way. It is organiz
ed well. Outside speakers. Con
ferences. Study with reference 
works in Mr. Risedorphs home 
helps tremendously. General stu
dent opinion is that the course is 
very much worth while.
Contemporary CIVC-344

For anyone interested in pres

as the. basis for discussion.

A very pleasant excuse for 
basking in the sun with a good

Burns, Shelley, Gray, Coleridge, 
etc. Reading assignments are

students, for at many colleges un
dergraduates have begun move
ments to subsidize players so that 
losing streaks may be stopped. At 
the University of Buffalo, the 
student newspaper asked the col
lege to give ten tuition scholar
ships a year to men who would 
be the nucleus for winning grid 
teams. At the University of Roch
ester, Pres. Alan Valentine re
jected student demands for paid 
players.
Most drastic move in the direc
tion of non-subsidization of play
ers in any form was made by a 
conference of 30 New England 
colleges. The code adopted at 
this conference prohibits coaches 
from contacting future players 'and 
from speaking at high school meet
ings, and it makes mandatory the 
keeping of public records of fi
nancial aid received by all ath
letes at member schools. This 
record must show that an indi
vidual receives financial aid only 
from those upon whom he is nat
urally dependent for support 
otherwise he %ill be declared in
eligible.
Meanwhile, the National Col
legiate Athletic Association side
stepped the entire subsidization is
sue by ruling at its national con
vention that no aid should be 
given college athletes except pay 
for legitimate work. The resolu
tion added that workers must pul 
in their time honestly. Of course, 
violations would call for drastic 
action against disobeying institu
tions.
Despite all this talk for amateur 
football, all those directly and in
directly concerned are watching 
with great interest the progress 
that southern schools are making 
with open-and-above-board schol
arships to athletes that pay board, 
room, tuition ana a little spend
ing money.
Although there is some undex>- 
current of dissatisfaction with the 
plan, Southern Conference of
ficials say that it is working well 
in practiceand they point to the 
records of their teams in compe
tition with teams from other con 
ferences to prove the point that 
it does help in builling great grid 
aggregations.
Heres the way one coach de
fended the plan: Were just do
ing business above board. They 
do it everywherethis practice of 
laking care of athletes  but 
they do it under cover. Down 
here we tell the boy what he can 
expect if he comes to one of our 
schools, and he gets it. Else
where, they get the boys jobs, 
sometimes paying them fabulous 
salaries for doing nothing. They 
call themselves simon-pure and 
look down unon our institutions. 
I cant see it.
There you have the summary 
of the great football debate of 
39-40. Collegians everywhere are 
watching with interest the pro
posals and moves intended to 
solve the problemand you can 
bet that the debate is far from 
settled at the present time. You 
are bound to see startling develop
ments on the subject during this 
year.
and the novel. One book report 
and several written discussions 
are required during the semester, 
but this is one course where the 
semester grade seems of little or 
no importance. To students of 
any imagination the course will 
teach an appreciation of the art of 
using the English language.
The course is conducted by 
Prof. KirkPatrick and, if the class 
is small enough, youll probably 
be invited to have lunch with 
Prof. KirkPatrick and his wife. 
Both the course and the lunch are 
entirely enjoyable.
Novel-C-157, C-158 
Professor MacMillan
If you like to read and never 
get a chance to do so during the 
school year, novel will offer the 
incentive. During the second se
mester novels from the time of 
George Eliot up to the present 
are reported on every two weeks.
In the intervening time, Mr. 
MacMiLlan lectures upon the lives 
and criticisms of the various writ
ers, laying a foundation for a bet
ter appreciation of the reading. 
Its a chance to read books that 
you probably would not otherwise 
read, and the lectures are interest
ing.
EthicsC-542Professor Schocn
Covers in order, without text, 
brief histories of the more out
standing religions, with an em
phasis on their ethical principles, 
followed by the ethics of a few 
great philosophers, among whom 
are Socrates, Aristotle, and Kant. 
Purely lecture by Dr. Schoen, who 
is provocative, interesting, al
though his dogmatism may grate 
some students. He is exceedingly 
well informed on his subject mat
ter, and is apt to begin some heat
ed discussions in class. No short 
quizzes, no final, two reports or 
exams during the semester. A 
good course if you want con
densed culture, and like a good ar
gument.

Professor Ross 
Students claim that the only 
thing they remember after wad
ing through this course is Dr. Ross 
artistic attempts on the black

may not realize it at the time, 
what makes the wheels of our National Government go round. He
French Seize 
Arts Graduate 
As Enemy Spy
But It Was All Just 
A Friendly Mistake
OT hc Cac
George Koren, a 36 graduate of 
the Department of Sculpture, was 
recently arrested as a spy in 
France. Authorities considered 
his possession of a moving pic
ture camera and a sketchbook as 
very suspicious, so they hauled 
him off to jail. When the pic
tures were developed, and proved 
to be of no military value, he was 
releasedafter a very trying 
time.
Mr. Koren spent the summer 
travelling through France and 
was returning to the American 
Academy at Rome at the time 
of his arrest. He was in London 
when war was declared in Sep
tember and had difficulty in loet 
taining permission to return to 
Italy.
A few years ago George was a 
young chemical engineer who was 
flunking out at the end of the 
first semester of his sophomore 
year. After an interview with 
ithe director of his college he de
cided to fill in the blanks in his 
schedule (caused by dropping so 
many subjects in which he was 
weak) with a course in sculpture. 
He had had no previous experi
ence in this line, but had glanced 
in the windows of the sculpture 
studio and thought it looked in
teresting.
Immediately George began go
ing to town in sculpture. After 
graduation he came back as hold
er of a Hewlitt Memorial fellow
ship, and taught as part time in
structor in the Department of 
Scultpure. While there he won a 
sculpture fellowship to'the Amer
ican Academy at Rome, and went 
back for his second year in Sep
tember.

constitution, the voting system, 
Congress, prominent political fig
ures (both their public and pri
vate lives), the electoral college, 
up-to-the-minute information on 
the functions of the President, na
tional laws, and political parties 
(espcially the Republican). This 
course is recommended for all vot
ers and voters-to-be.
Ensemble WorkA-Gll618
This course is divided into 2 
sections  orchestra and chorus. 
Although the orchestra is rather 
full at present, good violinists can 
always be used. The orchestra, 
under the able direction of Dr. J. 
Vick OBrien, head of the Depart
ment of Mjusic, has two rehearsals 
a week, on Monday and Thursday 
evenings. Five units are given for 
the course.
A large string ensemble group 
meets every Tuesday evening. 
This is under the direction of Mr. 
Karl A. Malcherek, Associate Pro
fessor of Music. Two units are 
given.
There are two large choral 
groups which have weekly rehear
sals. In one group, the singing is 
unaccompanied and the material 
ranges from sixteenth-century 
madrigals to modern part-songs. 
The other group is open to all stu
dents on the campus who wish to 
do serious singing. A public per
formance is given in the spring.

C. 1. '1. of Yesteryear 
Is Hi-ou^hl to l,i<;lil
liy Gilbert Klvenson
There is no better way of sur
veying ones position than to look 
at it through the eyes of the past.
This is precisely what was done 
when Dr. Karl K. Stevens, pro
fessor of Chemistry found in his 
desk an old c6py of The TARTAN 
dated December 16, 1908.
Unlike the modern TARTAN, 
this issue was in booklet form. On 
the cover, a young man with 
handsome features and a wellgroomed beard was pictured. The 
words Karl K. Stevens under 
the photograph explained why 
this' chronicle of a dead era still 
lingered in his possession.
Inside the cover was another 
picture, a very familiar one 
Industries Hall which looked very 
much as it does today. Close ex
amination, however, failed to re
veal Machinery Hall. An empty 
lot replaced the grey brick and 
terra-cotta building which has 
become so familiar.
Underneath the well-known ti
tle THE TARTAN appeared an 
editorial. It seems that the small, 
new-born Carnegie Technical 
School had lost its athletic field 
which was near the Schenley Ho
tel and was soliciting loans from 
its students to grade and surface 
a field behind the Margaret Morri
son School. Would every man try 
to lend the school at least one dol
lar?
In a corner of another page the 
Dramatic Club announced the 
presentation of The Birds 
Christmas Carol on the following 
Thursday.
The sports section showed that 
the Tech Plebes basketball team 
had been beaten by the Sewickley 
High School team by the score of 
37 to 19.
An advertisement of a down
town hatter extolled the merits of 
a court derby hat for young col
lege men. A rakish model called 
the Tech-negie was the latest 
fad in sportswear.
A witticism labeled Im
pertinence read as follows: 
Hegrd in a chem. lab. 
Whos seen Al?
A1 who? Alcohol.
The yellowed pages were a 
source of amusing as a record of 
the weak and tottering Carnegie 
Technical School, but it would 
have greatly surprised Mr. F. I. 
Gaston 09, Editor-in-Chief of 
The TARTAN, if he had been able 
to see the wonderful future which 
lay in store for his beloved "Tech.

one-sided victory Tor the Tnrtnn 
tankmen when they defeated 
Westminster 62 to 12. 'The meet 
was held last Saturday in the 
Westminster pool. The Tartan 
mermen took every first place in 
the meet to swamp the Titans. 
Bob Vance and Bob Boehnig, both 
of Tech, finished the 220-yard free 
style in a dead heat for the out
standing event of the meet. 
Boehnig was the best individual 
performer, having placed first in 
the 220 and second in the 440-yard 
free style. The meet was such a 
one-sided affair that coach Allen 
E. Risedorph put.his divers in the 
400-yard relay, the last event of 
the meet (this is one of the 
coachs pet tricks when his team 
is leading). Much to the amaze
ment of everyone, the combina
tion of Patterson, Anthony, Zim
merman, and Lewis worked, for 
they took the event. Before this, 
Patterson and , Lewis had taken 
first and second respectively in 
diving.
Because of the shortness of the 
Westminster pool, the boys ex
perienced a little difficulty, 
especially in turning. The pool 
measures 20 yards, as compared 
to the Tech pools 25.
The mermens next meet takes 
place on February 3 at the Tech 
pool against Temple. The Owls 
have retained several stars of the 
teams which gave the Tartans 
such a battle last year when the 
Skibos won by two points. Dont 
miss this contest which will be 
just as much a thriller as last 
years meet.
Individual and Team 
Contest Is Planned
Complete rules and regulations 
for the foul shooting touramcnt 
have been submitted by the Intra
mural Board. Each organization 
entering the contest; is required, to 
turn in an entry list of three men 
by February 3. Twenty-five shots 
per man are to be taken, and the 
team showing the highest record 
out of its 75 attempts wins.
In addition to the team com
petition, an individual tournament 
will be held. A qualifying round 
will be conducted in which each 
man must sink 15 out of 25 shots 
in order to enter. Highest total 
out of 50 will decide the winner in 
the Championship round which 
follows:
All men are eligible for these 
contests except members of the

Boxing Gains 
In Popularity
Coach Ernie Sesto 
Trains 50 Tartans
Intramural boxing has been 
progressing very well according 
to Ernie Sesto, boxing coach. Ses
to, who is in his ninth year of in
struction at Tech, claims he has 
some of the best material in years. 
About 50 boys have turned out so 
far and as yet, Sesto hasnt been 
able to weed out the good ones. 
In the middleweight class, how
ever, Ray Lytton and Bud Creed 
have shown great promise. These 
two have been termed the best 
exhibitioners of all the boys out. 
A good representation of weights 
has turned out in all classes.
Sesto claims that if he can pick 
out eight good men, he will pro
ceed to arrange matches with 
other schools in the class of Duquesne and W. and J. Until 
then, competition will be kept 
within the school, with matches 
being held, and championships in 
-eaeil Class decided.
Cy fii'oWff,' pestling coach, has 
also had a good turn out'.' .He is 
planning to arrange meets for a" 
team to be selected from the 
boys now practicing. The competi
tion mil probably be in a Y. M. 
C. A. league class.

After a lay-off of several weeks, 
the Tartan hockey team returns to 
the ice wars on the 31st of Jan
uary with a game against Fenn 
College in Cleveland. This game 
shouldnt be too much for the 
Tech boys to handle, and the ad
dition of Barker and Burleigh 
who hope to regain their eligibility 
by that timeto the front line will 
considerably strengthen the of
fense.
The Skibos next home game is 
on the 6th of February when they 
play Fenn again and Duquesne 
meets John Carroll in a doubleheader charity game at the Gar
dens to benefit the St. Pauls 
Shoe fund.

help but burn hot. And excess heat burns away the to

hot, flat, unsatisfactory smoke.

Reelected Secretary 
Active On Council
Elected secretary of the Col
lege of Engineering at the annual 
Smoker in October, Robert S. Hull 
was further honored when he was 
chosen vice-president of Evening 
Student Council at the first meet
ing of that group this year. This 
is Bobs third year in the govern
ing body of the evening school.
Bob (Romeo) Hull is an attrac
tive young man of medium height. 
He has been enrolled in the Engi
neering College for seven years, 
and his school associates state 
that he possesses the unique 
power of absorbing the contents 
of a technical textbook with 
casual reading, such as the ordinary person might give the lat
est Van Dine mystery. He is pur
suing subjects leading to a degree 
in electrical engineering and 
visualizes limitless boundaries to 
the improvements that electrical 
engineering will bring to the 
world in the not-distant future.
I-Ie is employed in the Central 
Office of the Bell Telephone Com
pany, where he has worked for 
three years. He feels certain that 
in work for this company is em
bodied his ambitions. Anxious 
for advancement with them, lie 
hopes to delve into the possibili
ties offered by the company for 
the promotion of science. Associa
tion with Bell Telephone engi
neers is considered by Bob to be 
an important phase of his every
day education.
Typically an engineer, he is 
cautious about talking and speaks

decorating were to be seen in the

from each corner, and in the new

Student Councils Post Holiday 
Dance, the final social function of 
the first semester, was held in

The gay crowd that taxed the

Mr. Earle and his group of fine

been well received, this evening 
being no exception.

Individual campus whimsies and

somewhere bought a spoon from 
the 5 and 10 and bent it around 
her wrist. The jitterburgs at Fur

Scholarship 
Budget Raised 
For 1940-41
Evening Student Council con
vened at 2:30 P. M., December 3, 
1939 in the conference room of 
the new Carnegie Union.
President Marcinizn asked for 
reports regarding coilections and 
student response to the drive for 
the Community Fund conducted 
by the officers of the three col
leges.
Council was informed that more 
receptacles for the distribution of 
the Tartan were going to be fur
nished and placed in the various 
halls of the Institute in order that 
all night students may have ac
cess to the paper.
The Council-Faculty dinner, 
tentatively scheduled for this 
month, has been postponed to a 
later date because of insufficient 
business to bring before the group. 
However, President Marcinizn ap
pointed a committee of the of
ficers of the Fine Arts College 
to discuss with Dr. Warden the 
problem of late lights in the Arts 
School, the lack of which, is 
working hardships c.ii-Sv'ning Ar
chitects, who desire more time to 
complete assigned problems.
Because - of Student misunder
standing', Council will request the 
administration to list the activi
ties fee as a separate item of 
#1.00 in all publications concern
ing same. Also that the activi
ties fee be entered as a separate 
item on the registration cards. 
More detailed information re
garding the matriculation fee has 
been requested from the admin
istration.
Council was formally notified 
of the death of Dr. James B. Nathanson on November 25 and a 
card of sympathy sent to Mrs. 
Nathanson.
Mr. Fisher suggested that an
other arrangement be formulated 
by which football tickets can be 
obtained, namely a reserved block 
in the end section, with tickets 
being purchased on registration 
nights and in the Cashiers office. 
Further discussion was tabled un
til a later date.
Amount Determined 
By Number of Units
Coincident with the announce
ment. of an increase in rates for 
1940-41. the Institute reports that 
the budget lor Evening and PartTime Scholarships has been in
creased twenty per cent.
Scholarships are issued as a 
form of encouragement to those 
who have distinguished themselves 
by outstanding academic work and 
who need financial assistance. The 
awards are divided into types: 
Scholarship to entering students 
and scholarships to students who 
have attended during the preced
ing year.
Requisites For Scholarships 
Applicants for Evening Carnegie 
Scholarships, available to new 
students, must rank in the upper 
seventh of the class and come with 
the recommendation of their high 
school principal. Former students, 
whose awards are called Evening 
Honor Scholarships, must have 
successfully completed the pre
ceding year with a minimum qual
ity point factor of 2.75, roughly 
equivalent to a C plus, on all work 
scheduled, including the Supple
mentary term, if taken. In ad
dition, the applicants must have 
carried a schedule averaging at 
least 6 hours per week for the 
year exclusive of the Supplemen
tary term.
The amount of the scholarship 
will be computed by a different 
method. The number of unitscarried in the previous year will 
be multiplied by one half tl?.e cur
rent tuition rate per urr.'c. This 
sum will be issued ipf the form 
of a credit toward^the fee for 
the current year. One half will 
be alloted for each semester. In 
no. case will the credit be allowed 
to exceed the tuition fee.
Registration Blanks Obtainable 
Students who desire to compete 
for these awards must obtain reg
istration blanks from the Regis
trars office and file them with 
the Dean of Men before August 
Maxwell moved that it be made 
10th each year. Inquiries con
cerning the above may be addres
sed to Secretary. Committee on 
Scholarships.
The above scholarships do not 
affect the ones issued each year 
by the Evening Student Council. ; 
These scholarships are issued in 
two forms; one on the basis of I 
scholarship and the other is de
termined by extra-curricular acI 
tivities. Further information in I 
regard to these scholarships may 
be found in the handbook.
