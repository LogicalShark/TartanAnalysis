Due to technical diffi
culties, student government 
elections have been postponed 
to Tuesday, May 1 and Wednes
day, May 2. The postponement, the 
second in the past three weeks, is the 
result of the latest in a series of issues 
Student Senate has had to combat over 
the past few weeks, from the original lack of 
candidate interest to the overloading and con
sequent shutdown of its elections website.
The elections were originally scheduled for 
Tuesday, April 9 but were rescheduled due to lack of 
candidates.
The Elections Board received some petitions but was 
still below the minimum threshold.
The elections were really poorly advertised [this year], 
said Karl Sjogren, a senior in public policy and the current stu
dent body president. Hardly anyone knew when they were or 
where to turn their petitions in to.
The extra time provided by the delay did give more people 
the chance to get involved. For the first time since 2004, elec
tions featured four teams of presidential and vice presidential 
candidates. Originally, no Senate petitions were received from 
students in CFA or MCS; after the elections were postponed, stu
dents in these colleges submitted petitions.
In total, there are 49 competitive seats on the ballot, ac
cording
Richards; chair 
of the Elections Board 
and a senior in computer 
science. 11
In addition, Richards said, 
more MCS students are plan
ning to run for Senate through 
the write-in process, a way in which 
students can become elected to the 
Senate even if they missed the petition 
deadline.
Students began voting online as scheduled 
last Tuesday at midnight. '
The first problem was discovered at 2 a.m. The 
elections website automatically matched the names 
of presidential candidates with their respective vice 
presidential candidates. This created a problem for 
those presidential candidates also running for Sen
ate because the computer automatically matched the vice 
president candidate with the presidents name in the senate 
spot, in effect adding additional names to the Senate ballots of 
students who were not actually running.
Due to the time of the year, I can understand these prob
lems, said Kelly Duncan, a junior physics and math major and 
a candidate for student body vice president of finance, but vot
ing for Student Senate is something that cannot be put to the 
wayside.
The elections were put off until noon to fix the problem.

Call to

Australia
CMU may produce 
defense-related 
software abroad
by Annika Rosenvinge
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is currently 
engaged in negotiations with the 
Australian federal government 
to establish research facilities 
geared toward the development of 
defense-related software engineer
ing, according to an April 16 article 
in The Australian, an Australian na
tional newspaper.
Southern Australia, according to 
the press release, has ambitions to 
become a defence and education 
hub, and offered to fund 20 per
cent of the cost of establishing the 
facilities. The Australian federal 
government would fund the remain
ing 80 percent.
The proposed partnership would 
principally involve, Carnegie Mellons Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI), a federally funded research 
and development center which has 
worked with the U.S. government to 
implement and develop software in
novations in defense, industry, and 
computer security.
Though the SEI is engaged in dis
cussions about potentially opening a 
branch in Australia, plans are still in 
their infancy, said an SEI public rela
tions representative, who requested 
to be quoted anonymously.
A branch in Australia would en
able the SEI to better serve the 
Australian market while fostering 
collaboration with Australian soft
ware engineers, allowing the SEI to

cal and managerial issues America 
and Australia share, the representa

Carnegie Mellon will be hold
ing its annual Meeting of the 
Minds, a campus-wide under
graduate research symposium, 
on Wednesday, May 9. The event 
will take place in the University 
Center from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
This is one of the few times 
when our campus really comes 
together across disciplines, and 
we are able to see and better 
understand what goes on in our 
campus, what intellectual cre
ativity, artistic creativity, and 
' new knowledge is being pro
duced, said Stephanie Wallach, 
director of the, Undergraduate 
Research Office (URO). Its not 
just for scientists. It cuts across 
all disciplines.
Over 400 students will partic
ipate and present their research 
in this years Meeting of the 
Minds. The event also features 
various competitions in which 
students can win cash prizes. 
The day will conclude with an 
awards ceremony.
Its important not to belittle 
the impact of these projects, 
said Ran Lui, a junior Science 
and Humanities Scholar.
Liu will present her research 
relating to autism.
Studying autism can give 
us insights not only into many 
other neurological disorders, 
but can also help us under
stand the way the normal brain 
works, she said.
Liu encouraged other Carne
gie Mellon students not directly 
involved in research, particu
larly first-years and sophomores, 
to attend the Meeting of the 
Minds.
Its an extremely valuable 
experience because they can see 
what their options are, she said. 
They can see what people are 
doing in other fields. It would 
be a really good way for them to 
plan ahead for what they might 
be interested in doing in the fol
lowing years.
Wallach agreed. Its very in
spiring and it makes you very 
proud to be at Carnegie Mellon, 
to really see kinds of things tak
ing place and the level of student 
involvement, she said. Wallach 
served as a judge for the Meet: 
ing of the Minds prior to her cur
rent position at the URO.
Whats really amazing about 
this event is that its very differ
ent at Carnegie Mellon than the 
way a lot of other schools do it, 
because we want it as a central
ized symposium, said Jessie

Last Saturday, more than 200 
people met at Freedom Corner 
in downtown Pittsburgh to take 
to the streets in a march to show 
their awareness and support 
of ending the genocide in Dar
fur, Sudan. The crowd marched 
about a mile from Freedom Cor
ner to Market Square, where it 
staged a rally.
Nessa E. French, a sophomore
majoring in ethics, history, and 
public policy and international 
relations, and president of the 
universitys chapter of Amnesty 
International, was one of the 
rallys guest speakers.
French emphasized the im
portance of raising awareness of 
conflict that affects a groups hu
man rights, even if its thousands 
of miles away.
I think theres always a debate 
of national aid versus providing 
aid internationally. Nothing we 
experience here is by any means 
%
comparable to the conflict in 
Darfur. As bad as some things 
might be for some people locally, 
at least our government is not 
systematically killing a targeted 
group of people, she said.
Since the start of the genocide 
in 2003, nearly half a million 
have died and another 2.5 mil
lion have been displaced from 
their homes in Darfur. The con
flict is taking place between the

Pittsburghs come a long way 
from its steel factory days. The 
city was voted the 10th clean
est city in the world by Forbes 
magazine on April 16, ranking 
it alongside such cities as Mon
treal, Vancouver, and Geneva.
Cities that made the cut were 
noted for their democracy and 
industrialization, specifically 
recycling efforts, waste control, 
transportation infrastructure, 
and energy generation and 
regulation, according to the 
magazine. Most of the cities 
were from countries with rela
tively high purchasing power 
 proof that a country has to 
have money to invest in green 
practices and can only sustain 
such practices if they produce a 
profit.
The list was derived from a 
study by Mercer Human Re
sources Consulting, which 
identified the overall quality 
of living of 300 cities around 
the world. The commonalities 
between highly ranked cities 
included focus on technology, 
education, extensive public 
transit, and headquartering 
of national and international
companies.
With seven colleges and uni
versities in the immediate area, 
the PAT system, and home bases 
for American Eagle and the 
Heinz Corporation, Pittsburgh 
fits the bill. And Carnegie Mel
lon, a producer of cutting edge 
technology, has made major con
tributions to the improvement of 
Pittsburgh and, hence, its rank
ing on the list.
Carnegie Mellon played a 
very central role in doing analy
sis on how to clean up the air 
here in Pittsburgh and continues 
to be very active in that area, 
said Granger Morgan, head of 
the department of engineering 
and public policy.
The university has pioneered 
projects in reusing old indus
trial lands and producing green 
buildings, Morgan said.
The Brownfields Center, 
located in the Steinbrenner 
Institute for Environmental 
Education and Research (SEER) 
within the the department of 
civil and environmental engi, neering, has been particularly 
involved in the re-development 
of old industrial sites through< out the city.
Over the past few years, more 
than $800 million has been 
invested in the restoration of 
Pittsburghs old industrial river
front. One of these projects was 
the creation of the South Side 
Works, formerly an old steel site. 
The Center, headed by Deborah 
Lange, director of SEER, col
laborates with the city on these 
projects.
[Civil and environmental en
gineering] faculty participate 
in various regional environ
mental initiatives, said Jim 
Garrett, professor of civil and 
environmental engineering and 
associate dean of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.
Garrett pointed to a number 
of efforts of Carnegie Mellon 
Green Practices that have had a 
regional impact, including the 
Hamerschlag Hall green roof 
project and the Southwestern 
PA Household Hazardous Waste 
(SWPAHHW) Task Force.
The Hamerschlag project in
volved applying a layer of soil 
and planting grasses, flower
ing plants, and other vegetation 
on the roof of the building and 
installing equipment to moni
tor rain runoff, solar energy,

Campus to undergo construction this summerBill proposes to pay execs
by Cecilia Westbrook
Junior Staffwriter
As students prepare to leave 
for the summer, Campus De
sign and Facility Development 
(CDFD) gets geared up for its 
busiest season. Once the cam
pus becomes vacant, CDFC sets 
to work on new construction 
projects that will greet students 
when they return next fall.
The CDFD handles design, 
construction, and renovation all 
over campus.
These summer projects are 
critical, said Ralph Horgan, as
sociate vice provost for CDFD. 
In order to build or renovate, 
students and faculty have to be
moved. But during the school 
year theres nowhere for them to 
go, because the academic build
ings are full.
Its hard to find swing space 
for them, Horgan said. Thats 
why there are so many summer 
projects.
Ideally, construction projects 
can take place largely over the 
summer after students have left 
campus, and be completed by 
the time they return for the fall 
semester.
Perhaps most visible to stu
dents will be the new Tartans 
Pavilion. The Pavilion will stand 
between Resnik and the football 
field. It will be a glass-walled en
closure large enough to act as a 
cafeteria or a venue for events.
On warm days, large glass 
windows can open and allow a 
fresh breeze.
It will be an indoor-outdoor 
space, said Bob Reppe, director 
of design for CDFD.
Construction on the Pavil
ion will begin sometime this 
summer. CDFD plans to have it 
completed by Homecoming next 
fall.
Another large project will be 
a renovation of two more build
ings on the fraternity quad. The 
Phi Kappa Theta and Kappa 
Delta Rho fraternity houses will 
get internal makeovers similar 
to renovations that have oc
curred in the houses of other 
fraternities, like. Delta Upsilon 
and Kappa Sigma, over the past
severalyears.
Many academic buildings 
on campus will receive smaller 
renovations and maintenance. 
The Tepper Schools stylisti
cally outdated interior will be 
updated. Hamerschlags famous 
rotunda will be renovated on the 
inside, and in summer 2008 will 
receive some updating on the 
top floor.
A number of buildings, includ
ing Doherty Hall, will be updated 
to increase handicap access. The 
entrance to Doherty, just in front 
of the fence, will receive a large 
and visible granite ramp. Doherty 
is the center of a larger ongoing

Amidst election difficulties 
and the nearing of a new Sen
ate, the current Student Senate 
continues to conduct business as 
usual. At last Thursdays meet
ing, it tackled its next proposal
 distributing personal salaries 
of up to $6000 to the student 
body president, student body 
vice president, and student body 
vice president of finance.
The policy was proposed by 
Student Body President Karl 
Sjogren, a senior public policy 
major, and Student Body Vice 
President Andrea Hamilton, a se
nior social and decision sciences
and art major.
The payments would be 
distributed in two equal 
installments, each at the end of 
a semester. This payment policy 
is currently against university 
bylaws, which state that each 
executive would have to be
come a university employee and 
abide by the typical weekly pay 
period.
My recommendation was 
that if it ended up being passed 
was to lower the amount to 
$4000, said Evan Osheroff, a 
sophomore business major and

Committee on the Student Sen
ate. I at least think that amount

Carnegie Mellons other links 
to Australia include a branch of 
the Heinz School and the Enter
tainment Technology Center in 
Adelaide, South Australia. As 
South Australia has the highest 
concentration of the countrys 
defense industry of any state in 
Australia, many Heinz students 
seek experience in this and 
other government and industry 
sectors. Carnegie Mellon was 
the first foreign university to 
establish a campus in Australia, 
and was given significant funds 
by the Australian federal gov
ernment to do so, according to 
The Australian.
The financial support that 
Carnegie Mellon has received 
from the Australian federal 
government has angered lo
cal Australian universities and 
other local organizations, who 
feel that they are more deserv
ing of federal funding since they' 
are Australian institutions.

their votes, they received an error i 
message stating that the system 
could not recognize their vote.
Previously, a group of students, 
now seniors and alumni, had 
been in charge of updating the 
software for each year. This year, 
they stepped back, and allowed 
other students to take control.
This was a rough adjustment 
year, Richards said. We did the 
best we could considering the 
circumstances.
Mock elections had been run 
before each proposed election 
date as they had in previous years. 
The simulated election consists 
of an Elections Board member 
logging onto the database as a 
student from each college and 
voting for the open positions to 
ensure that the site will work for 
all students. These test runs had 
not been problematic.
At 12:15 p.m. on Tuesday, the 
Elections Board and student gov
ernment decided to postpone the 
elections to May 1.
The changes may ultimately 
persuade more students to vote in 
the final elections, Sjogren said.
Controversy breeds greater 
PR and public knowledge and in
terests, he said.
In a similar elections delay in 
2004, almost 500 more students 
voted in the postponed election 
than did in the original one.
Last year, about 12 percent of
the undergraduate and gradu
ate population voted in student 
government elections, which 
amounts to approximately 1200 
students, according to university 
data. Five hundred students have 
the potential to seriously alter 
the election results.
Student goverment and the 
Elections Board have been very 
forthcoming about the elections 
timeline, even with the technical 
difficulties. Campus media orga
nizations have helped keep the 
community informed. Students 
themselves have a vested inter
est in their representatives, said 
Richards. Theres no excuse for 
not knowing at this point.
The candidates themselves 
seem to be unshaken by the elec
tion mishaps.
The postponement has raised 
our confidence, said Arasin of 
himself and his running mate, 
presidential candidate Serge 
Egelman, a graduate student in 
software engineering. We have 
the strongest platform and the 
extra time leads to a more in
formed electorate, which can i 
only help us.
Students can vote starting 
Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. until 
Thursday at 8 a.m. online and in 
Kirr Commons during the day on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. Results 
are expected by the end of the 
week.
ELECTIONS, from A1
For the future, we should 
look at creating a formal testing 
process, said Joe Arasin, senior 
computer science major and pub
lic policy masters student and 
student body vice president can
didate. This should include test 
runs earlier in the semester to 
hopefully find any issues before 
they occur.
The elections resumed at noon 
for five minutes until another er
ror was discovered. Between 2 
a.m. and noon, when the website 
Was unavailable, some students 
had unknowingly bypassed the 
message on the elections homep
age and voted.
At that point, Richards said, 
the Elections Board decided that 
the election could not possibly 
be considered fair to all partici
pants, the Board canceled all the 
votes it had received up to that 
point and postponed the election. 
However, some students had not 
been able to vote for any part of 
the elections.
The Excel spreadsheet of 
all active undergraduates and 
graduates had been loaded into 
the software. However, once 
voting began, the software had 
reverted to last years list, pre
venting first-years and first-year 
graduate students from voting. 
When those students tried to cast

Also last Saturday was Displace Me, in which participants spent the night outside in Schenley Park to raise awareness of refugees in northern Uganda.
PROTEST, from A1
group that the Sudanese govern
ment denies supporting, and the 
three ethnic groups of Darfur 
 the Fur, Zaghawa, and Massaleit.
Amnesty International was 
one of the major forces behind 
Saturdays march. The group 
distributed flyers and informa
tion cards and held a T-shirt 
campaign to publicize the event 
in the weeks leading up to the 
march.
Candice Warthen, one of a 
group of students from Penn
sylvania State University who 
attended the march, echoed 
Frenchs sentiments.
Were here to show the people 
of Darfur that people actually 
care, Warthen said.
City Councilman Bill Peduto 
emphasized the importance 
of student participation in the 
event.
I want to thank all the stu
dents here today. You are the 
inspiration for people like my
self to be here, and for thinking 
about this subject. I thank you 
for thinking about the girls your 
age that are being raped and the
boys that are being slaughtered 
[in Darfur], he said in his speech 
at the rally.
In addition to students from 
local colleges and universities, 
Pittsburgh residents from several 
different activist groups, includ
ing the Damanga Coalition for 
Freedom and Democracy, the 
Pittsburgh Darfur Emergency 
Coalition, and Code Pink, came 
out to support the march and 
rally.
The Sudanese government is 
the enemy of the United States, 
said Mohammed Yahya, who 
also spoke at Market Square. 
It hosted Osama Bin Laden, a 
man that resulted in the death of 
thousands in the U.S., and now 
it is the force behind the death 
of thousands of its own people. 
Why are [people] still supporting 
a terrorist government?
Yahya is an expatriated Darfurian and activist of the Damanga 
Coalition for Freedom and De
mocracy, a national organization 
with members throughout the 
United States.
Ladies and gentlemen. Be
lieve me, today I feel that [the] 
people in Darfur and I know that 
we are not alone, he said.
Pennsylvania Congressman 
Mike Doyle supported Yahyas 
call to action.
Where else should we be to
day, except here and saying No 
more? We need to keep the pres
sure on. Thats the only thing 
they will understand in the UN, 
Doyle said.
David Rosenberg, founder of 
the Pittsburgh Darfur Emergency 
Coalition (PDEC), urged partici
pants at Market Square to sign 
postcards fashioned in the style 
of an overdue notice addressed 
to President Bush, stating that 
The United Nations and the 
international community prom
ised the people of Darfur 20,000 
peacekeeping troops by October 
1, 2006.
Following this statement, 
signers filled in the urrent date, 
and then the number of days that 
these troops are late  208 as of 
the day of the march.
The group has collected over 
15,000 postcards signed by local 
residents.
Francine Porter, coordinator 
of Code Pink: Women for Peace, 
attended the march with her 
9-year-old daughter, Sarah.
I really think its important
for children to learn about the 
suffering of kids outside the 
world [they are used to], Porter 
said.
French agreed. I dont think 
that because Pittsburgh has its 
own issues locally, like any other 
city that has to deal with issues 
such as unemployment and pov
erty, that we can just ignore the 
struggles that occur on an inter
national level, she said.
The march and rally was not 
the only event last weekend held 
to raise awareness of African 
refugees. On Saturday night, 
Pittsburgh residents gathered in 
Schenley Park to spend the night 
in cardboard boxes and sleeping 
bags and to forgo food and water 
in order to promote peace talks 
in northern Uganda. For the past 
21 years, the Lords Resistance 
Army in northern Uganda has 
abducted thousands of children 
and forced them to fight in a vio
lent guerilla war. In response, 
the Ugandan government evictedmore than 1.5 million citizens 
from their homes and relocated 
them into camps. Among the 
participants was Carnegie Mel
lon physics professor Michelle 
Hicks.
Bill in favor

SALARY, from A3
would reduce the chance of the 
school seeing candidates run
ning solely for the pay.
The student activities fee has 
been considered as a partial 
avenue to garner the necessary 
funds.
I feel it is a conflict of interest 
for student government mem
bers, as wardens of the student 
activities fee, to use the student 
activities fee to pay members 
of student government, said 
Kirk Higgins, the current Joint 
Funding Committee chair and 
student body vice president of 
finance, and senior math ma
jor. I havent seen a reasonable 
argument that paying student 
government executives will 
improve the accountability or ef
ficiency of student government, 
and I feel that it is a waste of 
money intended for students.
The reasoning behind this 
maneuver is aimed at compen
sating executives for the work 
they do for the Carnegie Mel
lon community. Hamilton felt 
that compensation was neces
sary, not only to reward the 
executives but also to assist 
them if they are on financial aid 
or would otherwise be working 
in a job they cannot take on due 
to executive duties.
The specifics of the plan have 
not been formulated, Hamilton 
emphasized at the meeting.
It looks like Senate is inter
ested in taking on this issue, 
perhaps with some sort of ex
ecutive compensation to go into 
effect in two years, she said. 
Legislation will not be passed 
this year, but a non-binding res
olution of some type may pass.
Sjogren and Hamilton also 
proposed budget caps for cam
paigning materials, which are 
currently not allowed by stu
dent government.
Discussion of Sjogren and 
Hamiltons proposals will re
sume at this Thursdays open 
Senate meeting.

Students present original research
SYMPOSIUM, from A1
Ramey, founding director of 
the URO. A lot of places will 
have an engineering sympo
sium or a computer science or 
an art symposium. But very few 
places have an undergraduate 
research program that sup
ports students across the entire 
institution.
Ramey worked together with 
Barbara Lazarus, former asso
ciate provost of Academic Af
fairs, to create the URO in 1989 
and later designed the first 
Meeting of the Minds in 1996.
We were very committed to 
make something that was open 
to everybody, and we really 
wanted to very much include 
the arts and humanities as 
well as the sciences and engi
neers, Ramey said. We are a 
research institution, and what 
better way to get students involved in the very heart of this 
place than to draw them into 
the actual research process as 
undergraduates.
Ramey encouraged all stu
dents, faculty, and staff to 
attend the event, even if its 
only for a brief visit.
Its really exciting. This is 
like the academic equivalent 
of Carnival. Its really the best 
of what Carnegie Mellon is 
about, she said.
Pittsburgh named one 
of worlds cleanest cities
GREEN, from Al
temperature, and several other 
factors. The project, completed 
in 2005, was one of the first 
green roofs established for re
search within Pittsburgh. The 
project was completed in con
junction with the 3 Rivers Wet 
Weather Stormwater Advisory 
Panel on which civil and envi
ronmental engineering profes
sor David Dzombak serves.
The SWPA HHW Task Force 
was developed in 2002 as the 
result of a meeting at Carnegie 
Mellon. The organization pro
vides funds and events to help 
Pittsburgh residents dispose of 
household materials in an envi
ronmentally friendly way.
Green Practices is currently 
working on adapting the same 
type of program on campus.
We have recycle bins ev
erywhere. You can recycle 
anything, said Alexa Huth, a 
sophomore professional writing 
major and public relations intern 
for Green Practices. I think that 
gets people to recycle on cam
pus and then outside of campus, 
which helps the city. Our big 
thing right now is recycling.
Green Practices is also work
ing to get all campus buildings 
LEED certified. The organization 
also has installed solar panels on
Craig Street, Huth said.
Since our campus is in Oak
land, we do a lot of things for the 
city just because were here, she 
said.
Green Practices is also under
going efforts to increase the use 
of alternative transportation in 
Pittsburgh. The group recently 
produced a short segment for 
WQED on the importance of bik
ing and riding the bus.
Huth believes that the uni
versitys initiative to provide 
unlimited bus transportation for 
Carnegie Mellon students con
tributes to this effort.
It gets [students] used to it 
and shows them that its not 
hard to catch a bus, Huth said. 
Public transportation really 
does need to be utilized more, 
and the bus pass system really 
encourages that.
In addition, Pittsburgh was 
rated the most livable city in 
the nation in the 2007 edition 
of Rand McNallys Places Rated 
Almanac, which was recently 
released. The city topped the list 
once before in 1985, but is also 
the only city to make the top 20 
in every edition. The almanac 
rated 350 metro areas on factors 
such as housing, transporta
tion, jobs, education, climate, 
crime, health care, recreation 
and ambience.

CMU plans construction
UPDATE, from A3
wing adjacent to the chemistry 
labs. The steel skeleton for that 
structure will begin to be visible 
next year.
Many labs in the Mellon In
stitute will also receive varying 
amounts of renovation.
New study rooms will be built 
in the basement of Hunt Library 
and the Engineering and Science 
Library.
One big change for students 
will be the relocation of Entropy, 
Carnegie Mellons convenience 
store. Entropy will remain in the 
University Center but will move 
to the space adjacent to Si Senor. 
Entropys current space will 
eventually become part of the 
bookstore.
Part of CDFDs goal is keeping 
the CMU community equipped 
with state-of-the art buildings, 
according to its website. In keep
ing with this mission, Margaret 
Morrison will receive two ad
ditions that will place it on the 
cutting edge of design and archi
tecture technology. A bio-diesel 
generator in the basement will
work with solar technology to 
heat the Intelligent Workspace 
on the top floor of the building. 
Also, a new fabrication lab will 
be installed in which students 
will be able to use robotic tech
nology to create carvings of 3-D 
models.
The largest and most visible 
building project on campus is 
the Gates Center, currently un
der construction between the 
Purnell center and Doherty Hall. 
The center is due for completion 
in 2009.
By that time, the university 
may be pursuing even larger con
struction projects, specifically 
in the area along Forbes near 
Craig Street. Carnegie Mellon 
has bought property in the area, 
including the landmark Holiday 
Bar, which will be demolished in 
the middle of June.
Were trying to figure out 
how to connect current campus 
to Craig Street, Horgan said. 
That could be one of 27 differ
ent ways.
Although that space will be 
used eventually, CDFD is in the 
very early stages of planning 
the new addition, Horgan said.

Research performed on 
mice to study plasticity
by Cecilia Westbrook
Junior Staffwriter
A mouses whiskers can tell a 
lot about the human mind.
Alison Barth, an assistant 
professor of biological sciences 
and an affiliate of the Center 
for the Neural Basis of Cogni
tion (CNBC), has been studying 
mouse whiskers to learn about 
the brains ability to gener
ate new connections between 
neurons. This ability, called 
plasticity, is crucial to the repair 
of brain damage, and it has been 
of much interest in the field of 
medical science.
Barth believes that mecha
nisms of plasticity can provide 
information about one of the 
brains most fundamental abili
ties  learning.
Barth, graduate student 
Brett Benedetti, and colleague 
Stanislaw Glazewski from 
Keele University in the United 
Kingdom recently performed 
research showing the extent to 
which plasticity occurs within 
the whisker systems of mice.
We were looking for a really 
strong way to induce plasticity, 
Barth said about the reasoning 
behind the study. A big ques
tion for a long time has been 
knowing where to look.
Barth has done a lot of work 
with mouse whiskers, and she 
suspected that the right manipu
lation of them might lead to a big 
effect. It was sort of based on a 
hunch, Barth joked.
Each one of a mouses whis
kers is part of a highly sensitive 
organ. All of the movements, 
vibrations, and other sensory in
formation detected by these stiff 
hairs are encoded by neurons in 
the cortex of the brain. These 
neurons collectively form the 
representation of the whisker in 
the cortex.
When a whisker is removed, 
the neurons encoding that whis
ker no longer receive sensory 
information. Due to this lack 
of neural response, adjacent 
whiskers expand their repre
sentations, taking over unused 
neurons and becoming more 
sensitive to sensory information 
themselves.
The extent of this takeover 
varies. Barth discovered that if 
all of the whiskers on one side of 
the mouses face were removed, 
a large amount of plasticity oc
curred on the opposite side.
Barths results are exciting 
because they provide a new way 
to study plasticity on a greater 
scale than previously available. 
When studying an effect like 
plasticity, we want the changes 
to be as big as possible so we can 
see them, said Barth.
These results are also inter
esting to scientists because of 
their implications for patients 
with brain damage. Many stroke 
patients lose functionality of 
appendages or sense organs be
cause the neurons encoding for 
those organs are wiped out. If 
other neurons could take over 
those representations, function
ality could be regained.
Maximizing this process of 
neural compensation is the aim 
of physical therapy for stroke 
patients. Appendages that are 
used more often develop larger 
representations, becoming more 
sensitive in their motions and 
abilities.
Therapists have long known 
that if a stroke victim loses func
tion of one arm, immobilizing 
the opposite arm can allow the 
impaired arm to regain func
tionality much faster.
Barths work, however, is the 
first time the same effect has 
been seen for sensory organs 
like whiskers.
In fact, Barths findings could 
lead to new therapies for people 
who have lost sensory input due 
to brain damage. According to 
Barth, if somebody experiences 
a stroke that affects his or her 
ability to see, occluding one 
eye may help strengthen the af
fected eye.
Much of Barths recent work 
with brain function has had 
medical applications. Another 
paper she recently published 
focused on the genes involved 
in plasticity. Barth, former com
puter science undergraduate 
Andreas Pfenning, and computa
tional biologist Russel Schwartz 
identified a number of genes

New robots connect to the Web
Researchers develop new robot kits that can be easily assembled
The TeRK flower can play catch with its petals and be programmed to open and close its petals at certain times.
by Christine deBriffault
Staffwriter
Designed to be built with 
easily obtainable parts, the 
Telepresence Robot Kit (TeRK) 
was introduced by associate 
robotics professor Illah Nourbakhsh and his team of research
ers at the Center for Innovative 
Robotics last Wednesday.
TeRK is a robot kit that can 
be built by virtually anyone, 
from children to adults, and it is 
meant for people with little or no 
programming background.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, Nourbakhsh 
has built a robot that can be 
easily customized and linked 
wirelessly to the Internet. This 
creation came after a year and 
a half of research into how to 
control a robot using technology 
identical to microchips found in 
cell phones.
Developing this technology 
can be explained in three steps. 
Nourbakhsh said, The first step 
was making a remote that had 
a full operating system and was 
able to control the robot. The ro
bot controller, called the Qwerk,
can control the robot, search for 
wireless signals, and connect to 
the Internet once it is activated.
Tjie second step, or ingredi
ent, in the creation of a robot is 
writing a recipe that uses parts 
that are available to the pub
lic. These parts do not need to 
be welded or molded, and can 
generally be bought at home 
improvement stores. The recipe 
must also include detailed, stepby-step instructions that people 
can understand.
Although these robots consist 
of easily obtainable parts, they 
are not the robot kits that one is 
apt to find in stores. Nourbakhsh 
said that the end product will be 
a truly sophisticated robot.
The third ingredient in the 
robots creation is software that 
most people can understand 
without knowing a particular 
programming language. There 
are a number of different soft
ware resources available on the 
TeRK website that allow users to 
build robots that can respond to 
motion and sound.
Code to program the robot is 
also open source, meaning that 
anyone can develop a program 
for a TeRK. For the younger
crowd, the TeRK website pro
vides a visual user interface that 
is easy for children to follow.
In the Carnegie Mellon press 
release, Nourbakhsh stated The 
Internet connection means the 
robots are much more global. 
Not only can the robot be oper
ated remotely at any location 
with a wireless Internet connec
tion, but it can also send photos 
or video, respond to RSS feeds, 
or access the Internet to find 
information.
Nourbakhsh said that these 
robots are a part of the Internet 
community, you can share with 
anyone.
The robots can respond to any 
stimulus on the Internet. For 
example, one can program the 
flower bot (a robot that looks like 
a flower with six petals) to open 
its petals when the stock market 
is up, and to close its petals when 
the stock market is down.
During his presentation at the 
Center for Innovative Robot
ics, Nourbakhsh connected to 
a robot through the Internet in 
the room. The robot had a video 
camera that provided a live web

In a presentation called The 
Future of Physics, this years 
Buhl Lecture, Nobel laureate 
David Gross spoke about the 25 
most important problems at the 
forefront of physics.
The Buhl Lecture is an annual 
event hosted by Carnegie Mellon. 
Each year, a prominent physicist 
is invited to the Mellon College of 
Science to deliver a lecture to the 
public concerning a topic of inter
est in current physics research.
David Gross is the Frederick 
W. Gluck professor of theoretical 
physics and director of the Kavli 
Institute for Theoretical Physics 
at the University of California, 
Santa Barbara.
In his presentation, Gross be
gan with a short overview of the 
advancements in physics over the 
past 35 years. He noted that the 
rate at which human knowledge 
has advanced over this period of
time has been nothing short of 
remarkable.
The most important prod
uct of science is knowledge; 
however, the most important 
product of knowledge is igno
rance, Gross said, adding that 
major advances in both theory 
and instrumentation have led us 
to realize the concept of intel
ligent ignorance: Namely, the 
more we learn, the more we find 
out we dont know.
Gross said that some of the 
most important questions in 
physics today lie in discovering 
the origin and composition of the 
universe  how scientists think 
the universe began, the proper
ties of dark matter, dark energy, 
and how stars formed in the early 
universe.
Where this was once a reli
gious [and] philosophical debate, 
physicists are now attempting to 
answer it by using theories to 
run time backward. Even today,

Morphine affects 
brain synapses
Researchers at Brown Univer
sity recently performed a study 
showing that morphines influ
ence on learning and memory 
may be the cause of the drugs 
addictiveness.
According to the study, 
morphine hinders longterm 
potentiation (LTP) in the brain. 
LTP is the reinforcement of in
formation that is transferred 
from one neuron to another, 
the process that sustains 
learning and memory. It also 
regulates the release of dopa
mine, a neurotransmitter that 
produces feelings of pleasure.
People who use morphine are 
unable to regulate the amount 
of dopamine in their system due 
to the drugs influence on LTP.

Distant planet may 
support life
Astronomers recently dis
covered a planet, called Gliese 
581 c, that closely resembles 
Earth. The planet is warm 
enough to have water on its sur
face, and scientists believe that 
the planet may have extraterres
trial life.
The temperature of Gliese 581 
c is between 0 and 40 C, and its 
radius is one and a half times 
larger than the Earths radius.
Gliese 581 c is located near 
a star called Gliese 581, which 
the planet orbits every 13 days. 
The star is relatively cold com
pared to the sun, however, so 
the temperature on the surface 
of Gliese 581 c remains suitable 
for sustaining life.
Conventional telescopes are 
unable to provide a quality im
age of the planet because it is 
20 light years away from Earth. 
Scientists discovered the planet 
by detecting small variations in 
Gliese 581s velocity due to the 
gravitational force exerted by 
the orbiting planet.

Thin clouds attract 
NASAs attention
NASA is currently study
ing thin clouds that exist over 
200,000 feet above the earths 
surface. These clouds are noctilucent, which means that they 
appear by reflecting light from 
the sun after it sets.
NASA is sending a satellite to 
measure the conditions under 
Which these clouds form. In par
ticular, the satellite will measure 
the atmospheric temperature 
and moisture levels, as well as 
the volume of the ice crystals 
that comprise the clouds.
Researchers are also hoping 
to determine the source of the 
dust tkat leads to the formation 
of these clouds.

Electrodes used to 
simulate sight
Researchers at Harvard Medi
cal School recently performed a 
study showing that animals per
ceive artificial stimuli produced 
by electrodes in their brain as 
actual stimuli. The electrodes 
are located in the thalamus of 
the brain, which connects sen
sory data from the eyes to the 
visual cortex.
The study showed that mon
keys respond to artificial light 
signals in the same way as they 
do to actual light signals.
Researchers are considering 
the possibility of running such 
tests on humans. The goal is to 
simulate visual processes by de
tecting visual stimuli with video 
cameras. These cameras would 
then transfer information to the 
electrodes in the brain, which 
would send information to the 
visual cortex.

How Things Work: Nuclear Fusion
Jennifer Kennedy/Art Staff
In a nuclear fusion reaction, two nuclei combine to form one nucleus, thereby converting mass into energy.
Sarah Mogin
Using a lithium laptop battery 
and 45 liters of water, a nuclear 
fusion reactor can produce an 
estimated 200,000 kilowatthours of electricity  the 
amount of electricity consumed 
by one person over the course of 
30 years.
Unfortunately, the world will 
probably have to wait another 
30 years until this technology 
is available for use, since that 
is the time frame of current nu
clear fusion projects.
Nuclear fusion is the process 
by which two nuclei become a 
single nucleus. The resulting 
nucleus is less massive than the 
combined mass of the original 
two nuclei. This difference in 
mass is released in the form of 
energy.
Scientists hope that one day 
nuclear fusion will be used 
in nuclear power plants as an 
alternative to fossil fuels for 
producing power.
In the natural world, though, 
nuclear fusion is very much 
a reality. In fact, without nu
clear fusion, life on Earth would 
be very dark  not to mention 
cold.
Stars, including the sun, burn 
off energy through nuclear fu
sion. At the suns core, subject to 
temperatures ranging from 10 
to 15 million Kelvin, hydrogen 
atoms combine to form helium 
by way of nuclear fusion.
Converting mass to energy is 
as easy as E = me2, Einsteins 
famous formula, where E stands 
for energy, m stands for mass, 
and c stands for the speed of 
light (approximately 300 mil
lion meters per second). This 
relationship between mass and 
energy is precisely why many 
consider nuclear fusion to be a 
profitable means of generating 
electricity.
In order for two nuclei to fuse, 
they must first overcome the 
Coulomb barrier, the quantity of 
energy required for the strong 
nuclear force to overcome the 
electrostatic force.
All nuclei contain protons, 
and nearly all atoms contain 
neutrons as well. Normally, the 
positive charges in two nuclei 
repel each other due to the elec
trostatic force between them, 
but atraction is not the dominant 
force in most nuclear fusion re
actions.
When two nuclei come in 
contact with one another, the 
strong nuclear force becomes 
dominant and attracts the nu
clei together. This is the force 
that binds particles in a nucleus 
together. Consequently, the 
nuclei respond to an attractive 
force, allowing a fusion reaction 
to occur.
In nuclear fusion reactions, 
elements combine to produce 
heavier elements.
In general, when small el
ements fuse to form larger 
elements, the combination re
sults in an exothermic reaction, 
which is a type of reaction that 
gives off energy. In the sun, for 
example, hydrogen atoms fuse 
to form helium. This reaction re
leases 26.7 mega electron volts 
(MeV) of energy.
However, nuclear fusion re
actions resulting in elements 
more massive than iron (which 
has 56 atoms in its nucleus) are 
endothermic, meaning that they 
consume energy.
Heavier elements such as iron 
exceed the curve of binding 
energy. In other words, these 
elements have large atomic 
numbers, or a high number of 
protons in their nuclei. Conse
quently, the electrostatic force of 
repulsion overcomes the strong 
nuclear force.
On Earth, scientists are fo
cusing on the nuclear fusion 
reaction between the isotopes 
deuterium and tritium. Accord
ing to the Lawson criterion, a 
list of the conditions necessary 
for nuclear fusion to occur, deuterium-tritium reactions are 
the most promising fusion reac
tions.
When they react, deuterium 
and tritium fuse to form helium, 
releasing 14.1 MeV of energy in 
the process.
One of the advantages of this 
type of reaction is that the re
actants, deuterium and tritium, 
are readily available in nature.
Deuterium, also known as 
heavy hydrogen, is an isotope 
of hydrogen with one proton and 
one neutron. The most abundant 
hydrogen nucleus, also called 
protium, contains only one pro
ton and no neutrons.
Deuterium can be ex
tracted from seawater, and the 
Earths oceans contain enough 
deuterium to provide electricity 
on a global level for about six bil
lion years.
Tritium is also an isotope of 
hydrogen, but it contains one 
proton and two neutrons. Tri
tium is radioactive, and so, it is 
less available than deuterium.
Tritium is produced as a result 
of a reaction between an atom of 
lithum-6 and a neutron. Lithium 
is less plentiful than deuterium, 
but it still exists in sufficient 
amounts to power the planet for 
several hundred years.
There are several advan
tages to generating power 
using fusion reactions opposed 
to burning fossil fuels or imple
menting fission reactions.
First, fusion reactions are 
more environmentally friendly 
than conventional sources of 
power.
When burned, fossil fuels 
release carbon dioxide, which 
contributes to the greenhouse ef
fect, or the entrapment of gases 
in the atmosphere that prevents 
the suns re-radiated energy 
from escaping into space. Nu
clear fusion power would cause 
no such effect.
Second, nuclear fusion is a 
safer source of power than its 
more popular counterpart, nuclear fission.
The opposite of nuclear fu
sion, a nuclear fission reaction 
involves one heavy element 
splitting into two lighter ele
ments.
Fission reactions often involve 
the separation of an isotope of 
uranium with an atomic mass of 
235 into elements with atomic 
masses of about 100. Each reac
tion produces hundreds of MeV 
of energy.
Nuclear fission reactions also 
result in radioactive products, 
some with half-lives on the or
der of tens of thousands of years. 
These products are often relo
cated to remote areas to prevent 
contamination, as radiation ex
posure can be deadly.
With deuterium and tritium 
readily available to produce elec
tricity from nuclear fusion, one 
may wonder why power plants 
do not simply use nuclear fusion 
as their main power source.
Though nuclear fusion power 
is much safer than that of fis
sion and more environmentally 
friendly than fossil fuels, it is 
still far from becoming a vi
able source of human energy. In 
fact, scientists have yet to create 
a fusion reactor on earth that 
produces more energy than it 
consumes.
As stated earlier, nuclear fu
sion reactions occur at the cores 
of stars, including the sun, at ex
tremely high temperatures. On 
the Earth, its very difficult to 
recreate this environment with
out using a great deal of energy.
The Joint European Torus 
(JET), a nuclear fusion experi
ment endorsed by countries 
throughout the world, including 
the United States, has run into 
such a problem.
As of November 2006, 
the JET was able to pro
duce 16 megawatts of fusion 
power, though it required 25 
megawatts to heat the surround
ing plasma.
The JET is currently being re
furbished, and scientists hope 
these changes will bring them 
one step closer to making nu
clear fusion power a source of 
global energy.

Brain research may help therapies
PLASTICITY, from A5
that are likely to be induced dur
ing learning.
According to Barth, this iden
tification is based on their 
binding site for plasticity-related 
transcription factors. Barth 
calls this sum of genes involved 
in learning the plasticity transcriptome, and although the list 
of genes is probably far from 
complete, this work is a step to
ward understanding them.
Whats amazing is that many 
of the ion channel genes we iden
tified were already being studied 
in epilepsy and other disorders, 
Barth said.
Because plasticity is fun
damental to brain function, 
problems with these genes can 
cause systemic disorders, like
epilepsy or mental retardation. 
Understanding the plasticity 
transcriptome could lead to 
great advances in the treatment 
of such disorders.
But the scope of Barths re
search is wider than these 
medical applications.
As an affiliate of the CNBC, 
Barth works closely with many 
other faculty members and stu
dents interested in cognitive 
neuroscience. The central aim 
of the CNBC is to forge links 
between people who study the 
brain in computational, human, 
and animal contexts with the 
aim of better understanding hu
man cognition.
Barths interdisciplinary work 
is typical of CNBC affiliates. 
CNBC researchers are faculty 
from Carnegie Mellon and
the University of Pittsburgh 
from a wide range of depart
ments, including psychology, 
neuroscience, computer sci
ence, statistics, bioengineering, 
and mathematics.
Carl Olson, acting co-director 
of the center, said that Barths 
work coincides well with the 
CNBCs mission to bring differ
ent kinds of research to bear on 
the questions of human cogni
tion. A mouse whisker seems 
a long way removed from what 
most of us call cognition, Olson 
said, but it is a simple, beau
tiful system to study a major 
question: How does experience 
change the brain?
Theres a genetic bridge from 
mice to humans, Olson added. 
[Finding bridges like that is] 
what were here to do.
Robot kits used in classroom activities
ROBOTS, from A5
feed of the presentation. Then, 
he connected to another robot 
in his lab, and viewers were 
able to see the activities going 
on in Nourbakhshs lab. He also 
connected to a room where a 
different robot was watching 
over a dog.
Other uses 
for the robots 
include envi
ronmental sen
sors for air qual
ity and sound 
pollution, and 
the flower bot 
can also play a 
game of catch 
with its petals.
The teddy bot, on the other 
hand, is a stuffed animal with 
sensors in his ears and arms that 
can be programmed to respond 
to stimuli with facial expres
sions.
Robots like the flower bot and 
the teddy bot were built to break 
the unconventional ideals of the 
robot. Emily Hamner, senior re
search associate for Nourbakhsh, 
said robots dont have to be me
chanical looking, they can be 
cute and cuddly, like the teddy 
bot she created.
Nourbakhsh and his team are
interested in using these robots 
in education.
Nourbakhsh said These stu
dents can learn lifelong skills 
such as problem solving, the idea 
that they can influence technol
ogy and that they can incorporate 
the ideas in their lives.
The TeRK team wants formal 
education centers, community
Robots dont have to be mechanical looking, 
they can be cute and cuddly.
Emily Hamner
centers, and home markets to 
get on board with this technol
ogy. They hope that teachers and 
parents can get together with 
their kids for a hands-on learn
ing experience.
New robot designs and soft
ware can be posted and added to 
the website by anyone. Robot en
thusiasts from all over the world 
have already submitted new ro
bot designs and discussed ideas 
on the online forum.
The TeRK team is currently 
creating a curriculum for the 
classroom, a national robotics 
badge for Girl Scouts, Robo Dia
ries, and additional development 
on the internet.
One of Hamners roles in this 
project is to develop the robotbased curriculum for middle 
school children. She and the rest 
of the team have already gone 
to different schools and set up 
robot clubs for students to build 
TeRKs.
Hamner said 
that her favorite 
part about being a 
part of the research 
team is working 
with the kids and 
seeing how excited 
they are, and espe
cially how the girls 
feel empowered. 
Nourbakhsh said that boys and 
girls are equally interested in 
the robots.
Doctoral robotics student and 
project developer Tom Lauwers 
said that one of his favorite as
pects of developing these robot 
packages is seeing the kids form 
stronger bonds with each other 
and make new friends. 
Nourbakhsh said that he 
isnt afraid of the robots get
ting into the wrong hands. This 
is because the robots are highly 
secure. In particular, one can set 
access rights to determine who 
controls the robot.
Professor covers possibility of physical 
theory of biology in lecture on physics
LECTURE, from A5
physicists struggle with the concept that time itself 
is emergent, Gross said.
Gross also touched on the topic of physical theo
ries, including quantum mechanics and a physical 
theory of biology.
Speaking of quantum mechanics, he said, Opin
ions diverge greatly on the validity of [this topic] 
today. Some physicists think that it fails at extreme 
short distances, others maintain that it fails to pre
dict the behavior of large complex systems, and 
others yet hold that it fails when dealing with con
scious systems. Conscious systems refer to systems
where the observer determines the outcome.
Gross said that one major issue today is whether 
there could ever be a physical theory of biology.
If evolution could be qualitatively examined, 
Gross surmised, one day we might be able to tell 
the shape of an organism simply by looking at its 
genome.
The main difficulty with a physical theory of 
biology is that biology is often concerned with a 
wide range of time scales, which is hard to approxi
mate in physics.
Gross concluded his lecture by answering the 
question: Will physics continue to be important in 
our future? with an emphatic Yes, definitely.

A8THE TARTANApril 30, 3007
FromTheEditorialBoard
At the close of every year, The Tartan 
reassesses the years events. We present 
here a list of the people and happenings 
that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go 
to people and events that had a positive 
effect on the campus community; thorns 
go to those that have negatively impacted 
the campus.
|P| A thistle to the Port Authority for 
biting the bullet and keeping the 
28X. Call us lazy or stingy, but were 
elated that the 28X bus route will be 
sticking around to shuttle us to and from 
the airport. If only the Pittsburgh Port 
Authority would figure out a permanent 
solution to its persistent budget issues 
and quit crying wolf about cutting the 
Airport Flyer once a year, we could re
ally breathe easy.
#
A thistle to Carnegie Mellons grow
ing global empire. With programs 
in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Doha, 
Athens, Kobe, Adelaide, and more to 
come, Carnegie Mellon is priming itself 
to become a gold standard in interna
tional higher education.
A thorn to Karl, Andrea, and anyone who put a dime towards the 
campus bikes program. Karl and An
drea take a poke for championing the 
ludicrous idea, but the many funders of 
the program deserve a thorny stab for 
pissing away thousands of dollars so 
frivolously.
jpl* A thistle to Google for adding sweet, 
brightly colored offices right on our 
campus. While walking to school in 
dreary Pittsburgh weather, its nice to be 
able to see neon blue couches and chairs 
from the street. Google Pittsburgh: Were 
feeling lucky.
A thorn to university officials reaction to the campus bomb scare. Only 
two days after the tragedy at Virginia 
Tech  where school administrators 
were accused of failing to alert students 
of the first campus shooting  Carnegie 
Mellon officials decided that mum was 
the word when it came to alerting stu
dents about the bomb scare. Some sound 
advice: When a portion of a main road 
(Forbes Avenue) that runs right next to 
an event packed with students and com
munity members (Carnivals Midway) 
has to be shut down because of a violent 
threat (bomb scare), you should prob
ably alert your students about it before 
you talk to the local media.
A thorn to Carnival Committee for 
^ laziness. If the Carnival Committee 
was going to steal the theme from 2001, 
they could have at least put some effort 
into creating a better logo. Not only was 
the ladybug not really magnified under
the magnifying glass, but you could see 
the brushmark where the artist made a 
mistake. Lame.
jpl A thistle to AB for bringing us 
Demetri Martin over Spring Carni
val. Hes well-known, hilarious, and he 
carries around a giant pad of paper. Plus, 
his adorably dorky style of comedy was a 
perfect fit for his audience.
A thorn to the elections committee 
for delivering the most monumental 
debacle in recent elections history. After 
failing to make information and paper
work available to candidates (major 
failure #1), the Elections Board pushed 
back the vote until the week after Car
nival (major failure #2), only to have 
the voting system disenfrachise a huge 
portion of the population (super major 
failure #3). Save us from our student 
government!
A thistle to Housing and Dining 
Services for pulling gender politics 
on campus out of the time warp it had 
been in. Were glad the university finally 
got with the times and introduced a co
ed housing pilot program for the next 
academic year.
A thorn to Housing for stacking 
bunkbeds in Morewood lounges. 
What better way to make newly arriving 
first-years feel welcome than to house 
them en masse? Lease more apartments 
in Oakland, rent more rooms at the 
Wyndham, or admit fewer students  
whatever you have to do to get students 
out of lounges.
A thorn to AB and SDC for leaving 
^ us high and dry in our last week of 
classes. Term papers are piling up, and 
we could all stand to take a two-hour 
break from our problems in McConomy. 
Also: Thanks for teasing us with great 
films like Blue Velvet, only to cancel the 
show the night of.
A thistle to comedy, drama, and romance. Even if the three come in the 
form of the Hollywood movie Smart Peo
ple, we will still have our name attached 
to the entertainment trifecta. And who 
minds having Sarah Jessica Parker and 
Dennis Quaid roaming campus?
A thistle to the Controversial 
Speakers Policy Committee for pre
serving the spirit of one of our campuss 
most important policies. Thanks for 
seeking out feedback from students and 
faculty through town hall meetings, ses
sions with campus organizations, and 
e-mail surveys.
ij^ A thorn to readme for being offen
dssive enough to make it on the local
Ho-Jung Kim/Art Staff
news. We agree, the housing shortage 
was a nightmare (see above) but there 
are certain things you just dont joke 
about. As The Tartan strives to remain 
an appropriate media outlet on campus, 
we urge you to do the same.
A thistle to the market economy 
for bringing us some of the nations 
most tastiest food. Pierogies and sand
wiches loaded with coleslaw and fries 
are part of Pittsburghs unpretentious 
charm, but we must extend a hearty 
welcome to recent culinary additions to 
our blue collar city. Hooray for Chipotle, Trader Joes, and cupcakries.
Another thistle to Housing and 
Dining Services for kicking its 
culinary offerings up a notch. The burg
ers are fantastic at the Sequoia Grill, 
and you cant beat the convenience of 
the Carnegie Mellon Caf and Maggie 
Murph Caf. Also, the Tartan cookie: 
Delicious. Who knew plaid could taste 
this good?
A thorn to Blockbuster for all but 
^ leaving Oakland. All we want to 
do is give you money so we dont have 
to download movies illegally or watch 
them downstairs in the basement of 
the library  help us help you (to help 
us)! Come back to Forbes Avenue; Baum 
Boulevard is not nearly as accessible.
A thistle to whoever finally got 
their act together and redesigned 
Carnegie Mellons website. Now we just 
need some consistency across the indi
vidual colleges websites.
A thorn to misrepresentation and 
poor fact checking. Our school 
regularly rocks the charts, so it was a 
surprise to see U.S. News & World Report 
place our electrical engineering pro
gram at spot 126. The erroneous rank
ing bumped Carnegie Mellons electri
cal engineering department 117 places 
from our rightful spot at number nine.
t
A thistle to the library staff for tak
ing an interest in student feedback 
and actually doing something about it. 
They already added a late-night food 
and coffee spot, and theyll add more 
power outlets in the coming months.
A final congratulatory thistle to 
the scheming Walking to the Sky 
pranksters. Form really follows func
tion with this piece of public art. The 
two giant snowballs placed at the base 
of the towering phallic symbol this win
ter and the dummy hanging from the 
top of the pole were both entertaining 
displays that stuck it to the man. Thats 
what we call true artistic vision. 
Cheers.
University safety procedures 
leave students in the dark
iio
Claire Morgenstern
The day following the Virginia Tech 
shootings, a message from President 
Cohon was sent out via e-mail outlining 
procedures for seeking psychological 
counseling and reassuring us that we 
had security on campus. The university 
wished to provide reassurance that it 
couldnt happen here.
Two days later, on April 19, Carnegie 
Mellon endured its own potential night
mare. A graduate student was appre
hended by police with a three-foot-tall, 
torpedo-shaped metal cylinder in the 
backseat of his car behind Smith Hall. 
Police determined that the object was 
benign  though they would not, or 
could not, reveal what it was used for. 
Not exactly a reassuring scenario.
The entire incident lasted less than 
two hours, and most students were bliss
fully unaware of it. Officials sent out no 
e-mail warning, issued no official evac
uation or lockdown order. Even now, 
after 10 days, Official Communications 
has yet to explain the incident or reas
sure the campus. No press release has 
been posted on our own university web
site, though Media Relations spent hours 
in the wake of the incident talking to 
local TV and newspaper reporters, pre
sumably to ensure they had the latest 
information. University Police literally 
hung up the phone when asked for in
formation. Despite the horrific events at 
Virginia Tech and all that we had sup
posedly learned there, Carnegie Mel
lon made precisely the same potential 
mistake  cutting off communication 
to the campus community.
President Cohons post-Virginia Tech 
e-mail was similarly ambiguous. Serving 
more as a liability waiver than an in
structional tool, it put the burden on stu
dents to seek help in an effort to return 
to normalcy. Cohon and the administra
tion should first hold up their end of the 
deal by ensuring campus saftey through 
effective communication instead of ar
bitrarily offering counseling.
That e-mail also linked to an obscure 
university website that  who knew?
 outlined campus safety procedures. 
This site, ehs.cmu.edu, previously firewalled, was only made accessible in the 
wake of the Virginia Tech massacre. 
Still, its utility is limited. A student who 
visits the site can learn how to prepare 
for heat rash, SARS, or West Nile vi
rus  but not what to do when he sees 
someone wielding a handgun.
Environmental Health and Safetys 
(EH&S) emergency communication 
consists of AlertNow, a system that 
enables the department to make 5000 
phone calls a minute to alert floor 
marshals of a campus emergency. This 
system was not implemented on April 19
 an unforgivable decision in the age of 
text and instant messaging, PDAs, and 
podcasts. Furthermore, the system only 
alerts floor marshals and RAs, enabling 
those who are already in a building to 
stay there and offering no instructions 
to those already outside  exactly what 
happened at Virginia Tech.
Carnegie Mellon can do better. Days 
before the Virginia Tech massacre, 
Princeton University instituted the Connect-ED alert system. It enables campus 
leaders to send simultaneous alerts to 
individuals through landline and cellu
lar phones, text messaging, and e-mail 
in a matter of minutes using contact in
formation provided by each member of 
the campus community.
While no one could expect such a 
system to be implemented tomorrow, 
we have the right to expect basic, es
sential information to be disseminated 
promptly through the systems we al
ready have, specifically e-mail and the 
university website. The universitys ac
tions, or lack thereof, are completely 
insufficient. Clearly, it could never 
happen here is not a valid excuse; hope
fully, no student, let alone 33, will have 
to die before the university improves its 
safety measures.
Claire Morgenstern (cmorgens@J wel
comes all responsible replies in the form 
of phone calls, e-mails, text messages, 
podcasts, or instant messages.
A seniors farewell to Pittsburgh
Alexandra Kilduff
I debated long and hard over what 
form this send-off would take; Im not 
keen on listing my favorite accomplish
ments or favorite moments, but I am a 
fan of lists in general. Then I stumbled 
upon the Commencement websites Se
nior Events Top 100 List, which detailed 
things you should do before you gradu
ate. It includes such jewels as Make an 
appointment with the career center to 
go over your resume and Eat at Gin
gers Deli in Posner Hall.
Its important to check your resume, 
certainly. Ive definitely got a soft spot 
for Gingers tuna salad. But Id much 
rather leave you with a list of the expe
riences and destinations that Ive loved 
during my time here. Some of them are 
probably in the guidebooks or on Carn
egie Mellons list, but they still made 
Carnegie Mellon worth four years of my 
life. They might do the same for you.
Go to a University of Pittsburgh foot
ball game at Heinz Field. Youre probably 
never going to get Steelers tickets, so 
why not settle for the next best thing? 
I went to see Pitt play Notre Dame. The 
place was filled and the fans were de
mented; I was exhausted, but loved it.
Go racing around Schenley Park at 
top speed at night in your car. Schen
ley Park is a like a miniature Autobahn 
course with hairpin turns and the pay
off of a spectacular city view.
Go to the Cultural District for a show. 
Pittsburghs downtown might not be 
the liveliest place outside of rush hour, 
but the Cultural District is manageable, 
beautiful, and full of interesting acts. 
Heinz and the Benedum are my favor
ites for their jaw-dropping architecture 
and interiors.
Go to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. 
Bloomfield is one of those neighbor
hoods that got stuck in a time warp 
around 1971. Its gleefully anachronis
tic during its Little Italy Festival in the 
fall, when tiny old nuns come out and 
feed you cannoli.
Go to the Carnegie Library. Libraries 
dont sound thrilling, but the Carnegie 
Library is historical and beautiful, like 
an old-fashioned film set. Carnegie Mellonites tend to overlook its potential use
fulness for those end-of-term papers.
Go to Light Up Night. Finals tend not 
to leave much room for Christmas spirit, 
so why not get yourself in the mood 
early and go ice-skating in PPG Plaza? 
Plus, you can see at least 10 Christmas 
tree lightings and a once-a-year event: 
crowded downtown streets.
Go to Phipps Conservatory. Go to 
Phipps with a head full of worries about 
homework or jobs and it will soothe you 
quicker than a tranquilizer. My personal 
favorite is the Japanese garden.

Cuban Rap Agency pushes smart subcultural rap to the margins
Jessica Thurston
The process of causing change 
in a given modern-day society is 
often complex and lengthy. If the 
desire to cause change, to chal
lenge societal norms, lies with 
subcultural groups existing out
side of those norms, the process 
becomes particularly daunting, 
and it requires perfectly timed, 
often coincidental cooperation 
from other subcultural groups. 
It is in questioning and possibly 
subverting cultural norms, be
liefs, and meanings that outside 
groups are able to change the 
social order and increase the 
potential of a community to 
work towards its ideal state. But 
what happens when groups that 
originally served to represent the 
underrepresented, to question 
authority and fight for cultural 
change, abandon their ideals 
and minimize the ability of any 
group to cause change?
That is exactly what is hap
pening in Cuba today. Cuban rap 
and hip-hop music, which grew 
out of a heed for self-expression 
outside of the repression im
posed by the communist state 
under Castro, is being edged 
out of the cultural scene by 
newly popularized forms of hiphop and reggaeton music. It is 
reggaeton in particular  the 
musical genre that celebrates the 
trivial lifestyle of bars, dancing, 
and objectifying women (and is 
obnoxiously difficult to listen to)
 that is storming the cultural 
scene in Cuba and edging out 
rap. In the poor areas surround
ing Havana, reggaeton and its 
banal, poorly articulated, sexu
ally explicit lyrics are becoming 
ever more popular, demanding 
prime radio playing time and 
overpowering Cubas most tradi
tionally powerful musical force,
rap. How can a subculture ever 
succeed in manifesting change, 
in communicating its message to 
the public, if another subculture 
is suppressing it?
Rap is important to the in
habitants of the small island
 particularly the poorest, 
the Afro-Cubans living in and 
around Havana. Since it was 
first heard and adapted from 
rap stations in Miami in the late 
1970s and early 1980s, rap has 
served as an alternative to vio
lence and repression, offering 
an outlet for those subjugated 
and trapped in the most unfortu
nate circumstances in the com
munist state. Rap does not offer 
the same kind of cultural capital 
in Cuba as it does in the United 
States: Afro-Cuban rap criti
cizes inequality, discrimination 
and oppression, produces collec
tive ways of learning about so
cial conditions... and transforms 
social relations, according to 
Arlene Tickner, a Colombian 
university professor, as reported 
in a March 19 article from the In
ter Press Service News Agency.
Several groups are clinging to 
the use of rap to share their expe
riences of repression and social 
subjugation with their Cuban 
peers. Rap artist Aldo Rodriguez 
of the group Los Aldeanos, for 
example, told CNN.com, Ive 
pointed out the things that seem 
wrong to me, and the people like 
it. According to the April 11 ar
ticle, Los Aldeanoss lyrics con
demn racism, police harassment, 
prostitution, and inequality  
criticism often heard in Cubas 
streets, but controlled by the 
state in the media. The right to 
self-expression we have in the 
United States is not the same in 
Cubas communist state, and it is 
through this musical subculture 
that problems can be identified 
and addressed by the masses.
Enter the Cuban Rap Agency. 
(Just the sound of it is uncomfortable.) Founded in 2002 
by the government under the 
guise of supporting rap groups 
by getting them radio time and 
recording contracts, this oh-sodown-with-it state-run agency 
was established to limit the very 
self-expression so necessary to 
underrepresented Cuban sub
cultures. They just quietly oper
ate under the mantra that they 
will only support groups will
ing to forgo any ability to cause 
change or question the dominant 
cultural structures, and adopt 
messages approved by the state.
So now, a handful of rap groups 
are selling out to the agency to
gain mass publicity at the ex
pense of their independent, 
strong-willed counterparts. But 
we cant really blame them; the 
aforementioned articles have 
outlined the difficulty in gaining 
public access for any musi
cal group, especially with the 
frivolous, thumping beats of reg
gaeton getting in the way.
The Cuban youth culture, par
ticularly the Afro-Cuban youth 
culture, needs music as an out
let for self-expression under 
the repressive communist state 
controlling an overwhelming 
majority of facets of their lives. 
They need a means of combatElizabeth Liu/Art Staff
ing repression, of exploiting the 
underprivileged, poor, unsafe 
living and working conditions 
around Havana. What can be 
done to let the rappers messages 
for safety and cultural indepen
dence break through the haze 
of mindless reggaeton rhythms 
and the interfering Cuban Rap 
Agency? While supposedly de
signed to support rising artists, 
the Cuban Rap Agency is no more 
than a means of further subju
gating the already silenced.

Finance for first-years: Students need to get learn how to get loans
Michael Fitzgerald
Get smart, or get robbed. That 
was the message this week in 
the wake of college financial aid 
scandals. At least 60 schools are 
under investigation for employ
ees taking money and gifts from 
loan companies that wanted 
( their students business. Schools 
financial aid officers were of
fered incentives to ignore the best 
deals on loans for their students, 
and to instead recommend loan 
companies that gave the officers 
themselves perks.
While Carnegie Mellon is not 
on the list of suspect institutions, 
this scandal has hit close to home. 
Nearby Duquesne University and 
Carnegie Mellon peer institutions 
Columbia University and Johns 
Hopkins University are among 
the schools being investigated by 
the New York attorney general for 
seemingly incestuous relation
ships with student loan compa
nies. Citibank, Sallie Mae, Nelnet, 
Education Finance Partners, and 
Student Loan Xpress  some of 
whom lend to Carnegie Mellon 
students  have been treating 
financial aid officials to dinners, 
Broadway shows, or stock options 
in exchange for student referrals, 
according to an April 18 report in
The New York Times.
Its tainting the whole [finan
cial aid] industry; there should 
be more controls, said Linda 
Anderson, director of enrollment 
at Carnegie Mellon, referring to 
the widespread investigations. 
Who controls the $85 billion 
student loan industry? The 
Department of Education, 
unfortunately: They just put 
an administrator on paid leave 
(pending investigation) who had
Mellon first-years increasing fi
nancial aid in the form of loans 
and post-graduation debt.
In recent years, the number 
of Carnegie Mellon students re
ceiving financial aid loans has 
risen to nearly half the popula
tion, according to the Carnegie 
Mellon Factbook 2006^2007. The 
number of student borrowers has 
been on the rise nationwide for 
several years according to UCLAs 
recent study, The American
three or four years, and beyond. 
For students not borrowing to 
pay tuition, learning the basics 
of investing and debt will help 
ease the transition into the more 
gratifying world of self-reliance. 
Tepper shouldnt be the only 
place on campus with access to 
the culture of the dollar.
Loans arent one size fits 
all, said Anderson last week, 
explaining why she doesnt 
recommend any single private
Tepper shouldnt be the only place on campus with 
access to the culture of the dollar.
recently cashed in over $100,000 
of stock in a student loan com
pany, according to a Reuters ar
ticle last week.
Its time for Carnegie Mellon 
students to learn to monitor their 
own borrowing. The adults might 
not be impartial in their recom
mendations.
As annoying as some 
Computing Skills Workshops 
may be, the first-year require
ment is a smart response to the 
exponentially increasing impor
tance of computer and Internet 
literacy. Its time for an equally 
smart response to Carnegie
Freshman: 40-year Trends. High 
school seniors, though, have per
formed dismally (52.4 percent 
correct on average last year) in a 
nationwide financial literacy sur
vey conducted by the nonprofit 
Jump$tart Coalition. Every day, 
we are borrowing more and get
ting dumber about it. It might 
have seemed safe to rely com
pletely on college financial aid 
officers, but not anymore.
Make a first-year financial 
education course: one semester, 
three units. In exchange, stu
dents get the know-how to find 
the best-fitting loans for. the next
lender. Carnegie Mellon should 
teach students to find their fit 
themselves.
Carnegie Mellon students do 
not have to worry about their 
schools ethical practices for the 
time being  it appears that 
our HUB humming beneath 
Warner Hall has been ethical in 
its dealings with student loan 
companies. [Carnegie Mellon] 
has not received payments from 
companies that handle our stu
dents loans in return for steering 
students to them, nor, to the best 
of our knowledge, have Carnegie 
Mellon employees received gifts,
trips, or other favors from these 
companies, university President 
Jared L. Cohon stated in an April
9 e-mail to Enrollment Services 
employees. Anderson claimed 
that neither she, nor anyone 
in Enrollment Services as far 
as she knew, has received any 
compensation from student loan 
companies.
As laughable as it may be to 
take financial advice from this 
English major and self-professed 
financial failure, keep in mind 
that his dismal post-graduation 
job prospects will force painstak
ing fiscal responsibility, as much 
as he might want to blow every
thing on CoCos cupcakes and 
velour tracksuits. Not many firstyears outside of Tepper are all 
that interested in fixed and vari
able interest rates, APR ranges, 
or federal versus private loans. 
That should change.
Students dont have to stress 
about loans throughout the year, 
but a quick primer on financial 
basics as first-years can foster 
smart decisions from the start. 
Four years later, those smart de
cisions could be the difference 
between velour tracksuits and 
potato sacks.

Presidential
Perspectives
Pay student 
executives to 
better serve you
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Being elected to a student body 
executive position can come at 
great personal cost. Campaigns 
can be expensive and exhaust
ing, and the work is long, unpaid 
hours. Make no mistake about it, 
weve both taken on significant 
financial burdens to serve the 
student body the way we have 
this year.
For this reason, we have intro
duced legislation which develops 
a campaign fund for candidates 
and also sets caps on what candi
dates can spend. On our campus, 
anyone should be able to serve 
the student body.
If members of student govern
ment do their jobs well, then they 
spend a lot of time doing them. 
In the end, however, were still 
students. We have tests to take, 
assignments to complete, and 
papers to write. Being a student 
leader should not entail choosing 
school or leadership.
Burnout from self-sacrifice 
doesnt help anyone. The stu
dent in student government 
ought to come first. Our new 
legislation hopes to address this 
concern. Were proposing both a 
campaign fund and a small sti
pend for elected executives.
Does this mean we should give 
our student body leaders a lot of 
money? Of course not. We did the 
job for free. So will others. But 
under the present system, youre 
always going to have a narrow 
field of contenders, and that isnt 
how things should be.
Why do you think its so diffi
cult to get people to participate 
in student government? For 
starters, its a thankless job. The 
student body should value our 
student government. Executive 
pay sends a message that student 
government is important, and 
that its leaders are expected to 
be hard-working and account
able. GSA and several other great 
student organizations pay execu
tives with activities fee money, 
and for good reason.
Executive salaries would 
encourage quality and account
ability in student government. 
Money talks, and no one knows 
this better than Carnegie Mellon 
students. Students should hold 
execs accountable, scrutinize 
them carefully, and reward them 
for their service. If the leaders 
arent doing a good job, theyre 
out of here. After all, the stu
dents are paying them.
Weve had a great experience 
serving as your executives for 
this year; we got a lot done  
mixed-gender housing, TartansRec Program, and TartansWiki, 
just to name a few! But we think 
student government can, and 
should, do more than that. Our 
legislation is a first step. Next 
year, you should run. That will 
be one step more. Thanks for a 
great year.
With the doom of frnals week looming on the horizon, we wanted to think positive. So we asked,

Tartan golf team takes third at UAAs; Timmons wins individual title
by Sarah Mogin
Pillbox Editor
During Spring Carnival, while 
many Carnegie Mellon stu
dents were cruising Midway for 
booths, bands, and funnel cake, 
the mens golf team traveled to 
Orlando, Fla., where they com
peted in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) champion
ships. Thats right  they missed 
Carnival.
I [missed Carnival] fresh
man year and this year as well, 
sophomore golfer Alex Timmons 
said. I got to see Buggy on Fri
day morning  then we left at 
1:30 [p.m.]. We got back Sunday 
night.
A small price to pay for a 
chance to compete in the UAA 
championships; Its probably 
our biggest tournament of the 
year, Timmons said. The cham
pionships were held in Orlando 
at the Orange County National 
Golf Center and Lodge.
Last Sunday, on the first day 
of play, the Tartans shot a 298, 
the teams lowest score in the 
championship round. The men 
finished up on Monday, shooting 
311 and winning third place with 
a total of 609.
Emory won the tournament 
with 591 strokes, and New York 
University took second place with 
602. Finishing fourth and fifth 
were Rochester and Brandeis, to
taling 635 and 643, respectively.
Emorys always [at the UAAs]; 
theyre in our conference. Tim
mons said. Theyre in the top 10 
in the nation, so theyre always 
the big dogs were looking out 
for.
In the first day of competition, 
Timmons shot a 70, two strokes 
under par. This was Timmonss 
best round of golf in his two years 
as a Carnegie Mellon athlete, and 
it earned him the title of UAA in
dividual champion. He went on 
to score a 73 on the second day of 
competition, winning the cham
pionship with a combined score 
of 143, one stroke under par.
Theres always the dream of 
playing professionally;Timmons 
said. Winning this tournaments 
kind of sparked another interest
 pursuing a mini tour or some
thing like that.
Also playing for the Tartans, 
junior Howard Smith tied for 
fifth place with a total of 148 
strokes.
Smith fired a 76 on the first 
day of the championships. He 
finished up the second day at par
with a 72, the best round of his 
collegiate career since transfer
ring to Carnegie Mellon last year 
from American University.
As a result of their perfor
mances, Smith and Timmons 
made the All-UAA first team. 
They are the fifth and sixth Tar
tans to be named to the team, in 
addition to being the first pair of 
Carnegie Mellon golfers to re
ceive the title in the same year.
Sophomore Joshua Chen came 
in 14th in the championships 
with a total of 157. First-year 
Christopher Lee tallied a total 
of 161 strokes, and junior Blake 
Darby shot a 173.
We had a great time in Flor
ida, Smith said. This seasons 
been up and down. Honestly, 
wed like to finish strong.
Overall, the team is work
ing toward a ticket to the NCAA 
golf championships. The major 
goal for our team is to make it to 
nationals, Timmons said. Looks 
like were not going to make it 
this year, but hopefully next year 
well make it.
None of the starting five Tar
tan golfers are seniors, so the 
core of the team will continue to 
play in next years season. Were 
actually a pretty young team, 
Smith said.
Carnegie Mellon sports 2006-2007 recap
Summaries of individual teams achievements for the year
by Doug Fricker
Senior Staffwriter
The success of the Carn
egie Mellon 2006-07 athletics 
programs should come as no 
surprise to those familiar with 
the university. Known for its 
academics, Carnegie Mellon is 
making a name for itself in the 
realm of athletics on a national 
scale as well. This past year in 
Tartan athletics was  I dont re
ally know how to put this  kind 
of a big deal.
Football  Where to begin? 
A University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) title, perfect 10-0 
regular season, 26 players on the 
All-UAA team, a bid to the NCAA 
playoffs, and a win in the teams 
first playoff game since 1979, the 
2006 season was arguably the 
greatest in school history. With 
two 1000-yard rushers in juniors
Travis Sivek and Robert Gimson 
as well as a formidable defense 
led by senior safety Aaron 
Lewis, the Tartans, plain and 
simple, just wouldnt lose. After 
five convincing victories, the 
Tartans entered UAA play and 
defeated Case Western Reserve 
University and the University of 
Chicago before traveling to 
Washington University (Mo.) 
for all the marbles. The Tartans 
needed overtime, but senior Nat 
Greensteins field goal propelled 
the Tartans to a 10-7 victory and 
their first UAA title since 1997. 
They closed out the season with 
two more victories and then shut 
out Millsaps College in the first 
round of the playoffs.
Mens Soccer  This team took 
home the ECAC South champion
ship to cap off a 14-5 season in 
which senior Jonathan Browne 
moved into first place atop the 
Carnegie Mellon all-time pointsDavid Kjos/Art Editor

with 13 goals in 2006. Sopho
more goalkeeper Matthew Bazin 
allowed only 11 goals the entire 
season, while seniors Sean Filipovitz, Andrew Park, and Will 
Schlough were involved with al
most every offensive attack and 
Scoring opportunity this season.
Womens Soccer  This team 
finished the year at 8-7-1. Junior 
Amanda Rose broke the schools 
assist record in the final game 
of the season, and sophomore 
Abby Coffin recorded two hat 
tricks, becoming the first Tartan 
in school history to accomplish 
the feat. In a season that head 
coach Sue Willard called a roller 
coaster, the team ended the 
season the way they knew they 
could play all along. Junior 
Kasey Stever (nine goals) and 
Coffin (eight) will try and get the 
team to pick up in 2007 where 
they left off in 06.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
track and field team won the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) championships with 
168 points two weekends ago 
in Atlanta, Ga. Tartan senior 
Russel Verbofsky contributed 
points in both the 200-meter 
dash, with a season-best time
of 22.25, and the 400-meter, 
with another season-best time 
of 49.75. Last week, The Tartan 
sat down with Verbofsky to dis
cuss his experience as a student 
athlete at Carnegie Mellon.
Tartan: How did you get into 
track?
Verbofsky: I originally ran 
track to stay in shape for soccer. 
I realized I was pretty fast and 
started to run more and more 
from there. There is no greater 
feeling than beating one of your 
rivals to the finish line.
T: Was track a part of your 
decision to come to Carnegie 
Mellon?
V: Track and soccer were the 
reasons. [This] was one of the 
few schools that I was able to do 
both. After I went to nationals 
my freshman year, I realized I 
was better at [track], so I quit 
soccer because I wanted more 
time to concentrate on school 
and track.
T: How do you handle athlet
ics and the academic load at 
Carnegie Mellon?
V: It was pretty tough junior 
year; there were a lot of late 
nights doing work and my times 
in track suffered a little bit be
cause of it. Coach has always
been very good about giving us 
time to get our work done and 
making up tests when we travel. 
Senior year has been a lot easier, 
though, and my times are better 
' than ever.
T: Do you have any pre
competition rituals?
V: I like to take at least five 
minutes before my races and sit 
in my lane on the track and con
centrate on what Im going to 
do. I like to do all of my warm
ing up on the track in the lane 
that Im going to run in. I also 
get into the starting blocks the 
same way every time.
T: Can you describe what the 
atmosphere was like at the UAA 
championships?
V: The atmosphere was amaz
ing in Atlanta. The meet came 
down to the last race between 
us and the home team, Emory. 
Everybody was into the race, 
and it was probably the most 
exciting race I have ever run. 
When we got back to Carnegie 
Mellon, a bunch of us went out 
and painted the Fence to let the 
school know about our accom
plishment.
T: Which school is your per
sonal rival?
V: Wash. U. has won the last
Cross Country  Coming off an 
eighth-place finish at the 2005 
national championships, the 
mens team brought home a 12thplace finish this season, showing 
that theyre a force to be reck
oned with annually. Sophomore 
Brian Harvey blossomed into the 
teams number-one runner, high
lighted by a sixth-place finish at 
the NCAA regional champion
ships. The womens team took 
ninth at the NCAA regionals, an 
improvement over a lOth-place 
finish in 2005 and 22nd place in 
04. First-years Hallie Espel and 
Danielle Sedlack stepped up to 
lead the team at the end of the 
season.
Volleyball  The team finished 
2006 with a record of 20-15 
and a fourth-place finish in the 
competitive UAA. Seniors Catie 
Fisher, Malena Yablinsky, and 
Kat Fox received All-UAA status. 
Fisher led the team in kills, Fox in 
digs, and Yablinsky in block so
los. Carnegie Mellon hosted the 
UAA championships, allowing 
the seniors to finish their volley
ball careers on the home court.
Mens Basketball  The team 
finished the regular season at 
12-12 (5-9 in the UAA) and 
earned a spot in the ECAC South 
Region Tournament before los
ing to Lebanon Valley College in 
the first round. The team, with 
'only one senior in the lineup, 
played a tough schedule as four 
of their UAA opponents were 
selected into the NCAA tourna
ment. Sophomore Ryan Einwag 
was named to the All-UAA team 
as he stepped up this season to 
lead the team with 15.4 points 
per game (ppg).
Womens Basketball  The
sophomore-laden team pro
gressed nicely this season, 
finishing with a record of 8-17

four indoor conferences and two 
outdoor conference champion
ships. We always seem to come 
in second behind them, until 
this year of course. They also 
have a lot of good runners in my 
races, which always gives me 
good competition.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable competition?
V: Well, the end of the UAAs 
was last weekend, and in the 
4x400-meter relay we needed to 
come in fourth or fifth. I got the 
baton. I was anchor. We were in 
fifth, but I dropped back to sixth 
and we were losing then. But at 
the end of the race, we won. It 
was pretty sweet.
T: Are you particularly proud 
of any accomplishments?
V: Running my 200-meter 
indoor school record time at 
the Armory my sophomore year. 
It was a conference-winning 
time and arguably one of the 
toughest records to beat. Also, 
at nationals my sophomore year, 
where we came in sixth and 
broke our own school record, 
which also is one of the toughest 
records to beat. More recently, 
anchoring the 4x400-meter re
lay at conference in Atlanta to 
the first-ever team conference 
title.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
tennis team traveled to Case 
Western Reserve University in 
Cleveland, Ohio this week for 
the University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) championships. The 
Tartans placed fourth in the 
tournament. The Tartans came 
into the tournament ranked 
11th in the nation, the highest 
ranking in the programs his
tory. Friday, the third-seeded 
Tartans defeated sixth-seeded 
hosts Case 5-1. In a Saturday 
semifinal, however, the Tartans 
met their match in the secondseeded Washington University 
(Mo.) Bears for the second year 
in a row, falling 2-5. In the thirdplace match Sunday, the Tartans 
lost a hard-fought match to the 
University of Chicago.
On Friday afternoon, the 
Tartans easily handled Case,
bringing their season record to 
18-5. In the number-one singles, 
first-year James Muliawan won 
a tight second set to defeat Case 
player Joe Smetona 6-2, 7-6(4). 
In the second and third singles 
matches, first-years Ravi Raghavan and Jon Spero defeated their 
opponents 6-1, 6-2 and 6-3, 
6-0, respectively.
Case claimed its only point 
of the match in the number-one 
doubles when brothers John 
and Joe Smetona edged Raghavan and sophomore Yiran Liu 
9-8 (9-7). The doubles teams 
of junior Andrew Clearfield 
and Muliawan (8-2) and se
nior Jordan Koslosky and Spero 
(8-4) won their matches.
On Saturday, the Tartans took 
on the Bears in a battle of the 
third seed versus the second 
seed. However, the Tartans were 
unable to pull off the upset, los
ing 2-5. In singles, Spero won

Baseball
The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
club finished its spring season 
yesterday with a doubleheader 
against Robert Morris Univer
sity. Robert Morris took the 
first game 5-0, but the Tartans 
came back to win the second 
game by the mercy rule 11-1. 
Carnegie Mellon ends its season 
with a 4-13 record overall and 
3-10 in the North Atlantic South 
Conference.
During the first game on Sun
day, senior pitcher Matt Corbett 
and sophomore Brett Rehfeld 
had the Tartans only hits, as the 
Tartans were unable to come up 
with a run in the loss. Corbett 
threw a complete game, allow
ing five runs on 10 hits.
In the second game, the Tar
tans came out strong and scored 
four runs in the first inning to 
take a 4-0 lead.
Senior Jack Baders two-run 
homer in the third increased 
Carnegie Mellons lead to 6-0 
before Robert Morris scored one 
run and Carnegie Mellon'scored
five more to end the game early 
on the mercy rule.
Bader led the Tartans of
fense with two hits and four

and first-year James Langhauser 
each had two hits and two RBI, 
while junior Jim Stedman had a

Junior Ryan Comes and firstyear Dave Watters had two hits 
and an RBI apiece, and Corbett 
had a hit to round out the Tartan 
offense.
Sophomore pitcher Jon Coens

lowed only three hits and one 
run in the win.
Rowing Club
The Carnegie Mellon rowing 
club traveled to West Virginia on 
Saturday to compete in the Gov
ernors Cup, which was hosted by 
the University of Charleston. All 
of the Tartans boats made it to 
their respective finals, but poor 
water conditions caused most of 
the finals to be canceled.
Only graduate student Jon 
McCune and senior Adam Suhy 
were able to compete in their fi
nals. They took first place in the 
mens double event.

Two cities for the summer
Making amoebas fun again, tango lessons over pastaEverything you need to know
About following your dreams, and paying your bills
Stuck at home with nothing to do and in need 
of a change of scenery? A road trip to either end 
of the conteninent could do the trick. Head to San 
Francisco for a sun-soaked Bohemian adventure 
or to Montreal for a modernized taste of Old World 
culture.
San Francisco
Haight-Ashbury: The birthplace of the hippie 
counterculture movement and the site of 1967's 
Summer of Love," San Franciscos Haight-Ashbury 
neighborhood  endearingly known as "the 
Haight  still maintains its happening vibe. An 
abundance of independent booksellers, vegetarian 
cafs, vintage clothing shops, art vendors, and the 
absence of chain stores make the Haight the citys 
most eclectic district. The infamous free clinic that 
remains at its original location calls to memory a 
simpler time, but instead of flower children, the 
tattooed and mohawked youth that litter the streets 
and the scent of cannabis that lingers in the air lend 
to the locales Bohemian energy.
Amoeba Music: Located in the Haight, this music 
megastore boasts a collection of more than 100,000 
new and used CDs and records as well as several 
hundred DVDs, music posters, and clothing and 
accessory items bearing the stores fluorescent 
insignia. The Energetic Rockettes, Electrelane, and 
hunky troubadour Sondre Lerche have graced the 
in-store stage where Amoeba, unlike most music 
stores, holds free shows during business hours.
In spite of housing an extensive music library 
that spans all genres, Amoeba's used CDs are 
unbelievably low priced. With a selection as diverse 
and encompassing as its big-name counterparts, a 
trip to Amoeba is not only a spendthrifts wet dream, 
but also a chance to scope out the citys most hip 
denizens.
North Beach: Evoking an Italian atmosphere 
with its sidewalk cafs, picturesque parks, and 
Romanesque gardens, North Beach offers a quieter 
alternative to San Franciscos fast-paced nightlife. 
North Beach Pizza, internationally acclaimed for 
its signature giant slice, delivers to all areas of 
the city. A hidden treasure with a patio perfect 
for summertime alfresco dining, Firenze By Night 
serves soulful Florentine cuisine at reasonable 
prices. The stomping ground of influential beatniks 
Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, City Lights 
bookstore was a literary meeting place for the 1950s 
Beat Generation and today hosts readings and art 
shows in the spirit of its co-founder, poet Lawrence 
Ferlinghetti.
Fishermans Wharf: Generally regarded as San 
Francisco's tourist hub, Fishermans Wharf teems 
with sightseers who flock to the ports numerous 
postcard and T-shirt stands. Aside from the tacky 
merchandise, Fisherman's Wharf also includes 
eateries that serve fresh clam chowder and dishes
with fish plucked right from the adjacent San 
Francisco Bay. A wharf staple, the Bushman  in 
actuality, a mischievous prankster hiding behind a 
bundle of leaves  has gained notoriety for leaping 
in the paths of unsuspecting vacationers for a laugh 
and, preferably, pocket change. Offering some of the 
best views of the city, several cruises depart from 
the wharf and tour the bay, sailing under the Golden 
Gate Bridge and to Alcatraz Island.
Montreal
McKibbins Irish Pub: Every Wednesday, this 
Irish-themed bar holds $5 open-bar nights that cater 
to out-of-towners looking for a cheap way to have 
fun, meet other vacationers, and take advantage of 
the lower drinking age (18). On Wednesdays, most 
of the clientele are American college students, but 
a determined social butterfly can find party-hardy 
Montreal natives sprinkled in the mix.
Tam-Tam: Sundays in the citys namesake Mont 
Royal park do not slow down for churchgoers; 
instead, they feature daylong drum circles. All 
people are welcome, so anyone with a knack for 
rhythm and something percussive in hand can join 
the crowd of musicians, artists, bohemians, and 
students. Most park visitors choose to watch the 
drum circles and the bizarre Earth-children that 
frequent them, and the sense of community that. 
Tam-Tam  so called for the French onomatopoeia 
(for the tambourine)  fosters makes Sunday 
afternoons much more than a walk in the park.
Sainte-Catherine Street: The pulse of Montreals 
commercial industry, this 15-kilometer-long 
thoroughfare bustles with clothing boutiques, 
popular designer emporiums, footwear outlets, 
and department stores. Sainte-Catherines most 
ingenious attraction cannot be seen from above; a 
network of malls sprawls underground, a necessity 
for the frigid winter months.
Napoli Pizzeria: Located on Saint-Denis Street in 
the citys Latin Quarter, this restaurant is a 
must-visit for more than its savory Italian cuisine. 
Manned by a staff of friends and family, the 
restaurants service outdoes that of its competitors. 
The owner often-sits down with his customers, 
offering a brief tango lesson and taking a photograph 
to put on the wall next to the cavalcade of awards, 
postcards, and pictures of the homeland.
Vieux-Port: Characterized by its cobblestone 
streets and ornate buildings, the oldest part of 
city is situated on the Saint Lawrence River and 
teems with street performers, terrace cafs, tourist 
boutiques, and prime real estate. The old port is 
the best place to spend an evening, soaking in the 
sounds of classical violinists and Native American 
drummers while dining in the crisp summer breeze.

Dear Janet,
I have a degree in information 
systems and one in creative 
writing... and $75K in student 
loans. I dont want to take a job 
in the IT sector, but its much 
more lucrative than publishing
 which is really what I want to 
do. I got the IS degree because 
I enjoyed it once and I wanted 
a job that could support me, 
but now Im just afraid of dying 
young without having been 
able to do something I enjoy. 
Advice?
Poet, Especially Non-decisive 
Dear PEN,
Well, i think youve mostly 
answered your own question 
for me, havent you? You know 
what you really want to do, youre 
just afraid of not being able to 
make a living doing it. And Lord 
knows thats a valid concern! 
But, since youre asking a writer 
for advice, you know Im not 
going to tell you to turn tall and 
get a secure, well-paying job in 
the IT sector. Theres a balance, 
though, between following your 
dreams and paying the rent, and 
its that delicate balance that you 
now have to seek out. Theres, a 
whole spectrum of following your 
dreams" that lies between trying to 
make a living as, say, a publishing
poet, and giving up and going 
back to information systems: See 
if you can find a job or subspecialty 
within the publishing industry that 
youll enjoy, and that will allow you 
to use your talents, but that will 
also allow you to, you know, put 
food in your belly and a roof over 
your head. As for your loans, get 
some books on financial planning 
to help you figure out the best way 
to manage your debt.
Look at it this way: You have your 
health, your youth, your future  
you have everything in the world 
right now. Why in the world would 
you not go for it? Even if you find 
out you cant make a living at it, 
you wont have to live the rest of 
your life with that regret hanging 
over your head. And if you can get 
by in publishing (which I suspect 
youll be able to), you will have the 
rare privilege of being paid to do 
something you love. How many 
people can say that? Now is the 
time in your life to be daring; I wish 
you nothing but the best.

A senior praised the work ethic of Carnegie Mellon

our university may be called nerdy or antisocial, it 
Is never called lazy. On top of this, the work ethic 
gained at Carnegie Mellon will never disappear, even 
if we want it to. This may sound good, except for the 
fact that none of us will ever successfully watch a

---------------------------------------------------

Last week, the School of Drama produced a version of Gregor 
Biichners Woyzeck in Purnells Helen Wayne Rauh Studio 
Theater. Woyzeck is a difficult play to produce; no one knows 
what order the scenes go in or whether its even finished. 
Playwright Karl Georg Bchner died at the age of 23 in 1837, 
and Woyzeck was discovered in a locked desk 40 years later.
In the play, Franz Woyzeck is a soldier performing menial 
tasks to support his mistress Marie (junior Jessica Waxman) 
and their bastard child. On the doctors orders, Woyzeck 
only eats peas for months, decaying his mental and physical 
health. Marie begins an affair with the drum major, and 
Woyzeck murders Marie after discovering her betrayal.
There were many aspects of the show that seemed to 
contradict this socially progressive plot. Instead of condoning 
social revolutions and challenging imperialism and 
government authority, this show seemed to get stuck in a 
swamp of gender and racial issues.
In the show, Woyzeck was the only non-Caucasian character. 
Director Dan Rigazzi, a masters-student, made this casting 
decision in order to portray the injustice against blacks in 
the 1950s. The parallels between a colonial society and a 
racist one are certainly valid, but this approach seemed 
to depreciate Bchner's socially progressive, or Marxist, 
message. Like many racially conscious plays, the story of 
Woyzeck quickly turned binary, portraying an oversimplified 
version of Bchner's intent.
Andrew Wilkes-Krier is no ordinary man. Looking as if his hair 
has not seen a good wash in days,' he sports his signature 
off-white jeans and a T-shirt with his name on it, fake blood 
seeping from the neckline. Haphazardly tattooed, dark green 
slits adorn his arms, and he speaks with the vocabulary of an 
Ivy League scholar  all the while exhibiting a refreshingly 
sincere interest in what other people have to say. Not only 
does he politely address the questions asked of him, but he 
also asks for a perspective on them, making the pre-lecture 
meeting less an interview than a chat between friends.
Having completed Close Calls With Brick Walls, his first 
non-solo album, in addition to a Japanese and South Korean 
tour in 2006, Andrew W.K. has been riding the wave of fan 
support and critical recognition. Despite the acclaim that his 
boisterous onstage antics and party anthems have garnered, 
he remains appreciative, introspective, and insightful. He 
describes his series of lectures not as lectures, because 
that is too confining.... Ive been thinking that its more like 
a happening, a pure event where all that is set is a time 
and location. Without preparing any particular topic for 
discussion, he travels from place to place, college campuses 
and clubs, engaging his audience in discussion to promote 
"true creative collaboration.
Displaying unexpected modesty, given the success of his 
career, he hoots with surprise when asked how he feels about 
being compared to Jack Black, eagerly inquiring, "Youve 
heard it more than once? Is it mostly a physical comparison?" 
and adding, I think hes got a great vibe!" The conversation 
soon veers off the topic of his reason for being at Carnegie
Woyzeck is a tragic character because he is partly responsible 
for his downfall. Woyzeck is powerful because it denotes all 
of its characters as participants in the same society  many 
cogs in one purposeless wheel. It manifests the illusions of 
society and questions the very institutions that mankind 
subscribes to. This concept was beautifully demonstrated by 
the dialogue created by the double-casting of junior Barrett 
Davis as the doctor and pawnbroker. To protect his own 
interests, the doctor manipulates Woyzeck to lash out against 
his loved ones. The same actor provides Woyzeck the knife to 
murder Marie. The pawnbroker does well to summarize the 
play in a single line, Its all nothing? Well, its all money.
From the first beat, Woyzeck is depicted as both insane and 
a murderer. The audience never sees his struggle against the 
power systems or his inner debate over the value of a man, his 
own morality, and his rightful place. Woyzeck is immediately 
dismissed as mentally ill and thus became an unreliable 
protagonist. If there had been a more obvious progression 
into insanity, the audience might have seen the forces that 
drove Woyzeck to kill his only love in life. There was also no 
compassion between Woyzeck and Marie. Woyzecks rage 
was not justified, because the audience could not understand 
the magnitude of his loss or the intensity of the betrayal.
While senior Larry Powell's performance was riveting and 
passionate, his motives were not clear.
Some of Woyzecks actions and lines often raised gender 
issues. Marie's lustful intrigue, the drum major, was meant
Mellon, indicating his preference to speak about the human 
experience rather than his career. Wilkes-Krier aims to involve 
his audience in a discussion of life, love, people, and general 
subjects that allow for in-depth verbal examination.
When it comes time for the lecture to begin, the audience, 
comprised almost entirely of college students, cheers and 
chants for the anticipated party-rocking idol. Wilkes-Krier 
calmly takes the stage and thanks everyone for coming, 
adding, "I'm just going to do a few moves and ... see what 
happens. Next, he goes into an animalistic craze, arms 
flailing and head banging wildly while he swings a stool 
around and roars into his microphone. Without transition, 
he opens the seminar with a discussion of his reluctance to 
use definitive statements. Standing next to the stool that he 
had been brandishing feverishly moments before, he brings 
up the linguistic fault inherent in using words like "know 
when speaking of people or ideas that cannot be absolutely 
defined. The audience quickly jumps in with its members 
own opinions, contributing to a conversation that focuses on 
linguistic disparity and the perception of life as malleable and 
subjective, summated by Wilkes-Kriers observation: "Words 
in fact color some portion of our experience."
Through the philosophical discussion engendered by WilkesKrier, the audience was able to learn about its speaker, the 
man in the faux-bloody T-shirt who sings about partying 
and getting wasted, a state he describes as complete 
displacement from oneself, not just being intoxicated. A 
certain profundity underlies his philosophy of embracing life 
and love; he proposes, "A state of love allows for maximum
to objectify her, yet 
Woyzeck seemed to 
do the same. In the 
English translation used 
for last week's show, 
for example, Woyzeck 
constantly called Marie 
a bitch. The translation 
also focused on Maries 
moral struggles more 
than Woyzeck's. Overall, 
the female characters 
were portrayed as 
promiscuous deviants, 
central to Woyzecks 
downfall. The direction failed to recognize that Marie was 
misled by these same forces as Woyzeck. She is supposed to 
be a victim  not a villain.
Though the production may have misinterpreted Maries 
role in the story, the disjointed scenes were composed in a 
sensible way that successfully furthered the plot  quite 
a feat considering the ambiguity of the original text. 
Additionally, the design of the show was an impeccable 
display of craft and creativity. The set, lighting, costumes, and 
sound seamlessly worked together to communicate the world 
of the play and transport the audience.

fun." At the end of the discussion, Wilkes-Krier asks the 
audience members to only think and speak about things they 
love, and afterwards signs posters and speaks with his fans 
without coming off the least bit jaded.
Unconventional and unrestricted as always, his quasi-lecture 
brought up a number of questions regarding the human 
experience. With the intent of opening his mind to the ideas 
that the audience members aired, Wilkes-Krier's discussion 
grew tense when disagreement brewed within the crowd, 
so he closed the talk by reuniting the audience in song. 
Demonstrating his fondness of harmony and connecting with 
people, he said, "I'd like to look at differences [among people] 
coming from a place that says were the same, first and 
foremost, in that were human."

What are you doing this summer?F15flPaperhoL.settiaBBBEBflOn local musiciansradio station
Rock fans have waited years, decades actually, for two 
singular events to happen. Both have been hinted at 
by band members and their agents, only to collapse at 
the last minute. And while hope springs eternal, the 
arrival of Chinese Democracy on these shores has yet 
to happen. Oh sure, there have been leaks of various 
songs off that album, teasing us with the genius of one 
W. Axl Rose, but still we wait. The press has been eager 
to point out that it has been a decade and a half in the 
making, and that even Brian Wilson has been able to 
finish his mythical opus SMiLE by now. But, Guns isnt 
the only band who has yet to finish what it started years 
ago. This spring, 11 years after the band appeared on 
the MTV Awards as a group, the original Van Halen has 
yet to complete its much, much longed-for reunion. At 
one point, Eddie V. began talking up David Lee Roth in 
interviews, telling him to come on down to the studio.
Of course Diamond Dave jumped at the chance, and 
before you could say "Jump, tour dates started leaking 
out, and rumors of a performance of the original four at 
their induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame flew.
Oh sure, wed heard whispers in 2004 that they were 
trying again with Dave, but nothing came of it. This 
time, there was even a new pic of the band, with Eddie 
Van Halens son handling the bass. Could it be? Alas, 
no, now is still not the time. So, with no new GNR, no 
David Lee, whats a rock fan to do this summer?
Crawl back into the underground, of course. While the 
two aforementioned bands get things sorted out, and
I hope (and think) they will  they really have to, we 
miss them dearly  we have the Dio-era Black Sabbath 
touring the country with Megadeth and Machine Head 
in tow. Its a metal fans wet dream, really, with the level 
of musicianship of Megadeth and Head, and of course 
its been 14 years since Dio stood on a stage with Iommi 
and the other godfathers of heavy. If the tour opener was 
any indication, this should not be missed. Especially 
since there has been no indication that it will continue 
past this year-long tour cycle. Like any other cosmic 
event, once its gone... its gone. Your best chance to 
catch Sabbath somewhat locally is next month, May 11 
at the Tower Amphitheater in Cleveland.
Hour leading the charge for American Metal. Also, 
check out the viking metal of Amon Amarth, but hey
 lets face it  youre gonna go for Gwar, youre 
gonna wear a white T-shirt, and you're gonna get 
bloody on purpose. Again, Cleveland is the closest this 
festival comes to the 'Burgh, and that happens July 21, 
also at the Tower Amphitheater. Now, if you make the 
drive out, please make it a point to check out the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame. That itself is worth the drive, and 
this year, with Van Halen finally getting in, all we have 
to wait for is Kiss.
Of course, the granddaddy of them all (and I mean that 
in the literal sense) is Ozzy Osbournes Ozzfest  free 
for the first time in its history. This year, Ozzfest will 
come to. Pittsburgh on August 24 at the Post-Gazette 
Pavilion. The concerts, sponsors are picking up the 
cost of the show, meaning you can go to Ozzfest.com 
and print out free tickets. Or, if you pre-order Ozzys 
new album, you get a pre-sale password that gets 
you and a buddy in as well. The details arent concrete 
yet, so please check out Ozzfest.com for all the solids.
In the meantime, know that this years line-up features 
the most uber-metal yet: Ozzy, Lamb of God, and 
Hatebreed on the mainstage with Nile and Behemoth 
on the second. If youre a fan of Egyptology and death 
metal, Nile is your band. Lyrics that are researched with 
an academic bent are the bands forte, and musically, 
Nile is among the elite in the death metal realm, as 
is Behemoth, one of Europe's "Blackened Death 
metal bands, who, along with Vader, sealed Polands 
reputation as an important metal scene.
Finally, if you cant make any of these drives, or are 
leaving town, Machine Head plays an off-date on May 
13 at the Rex Theater on the South Side, two days after 
God Forbid should leave it in shambles (on May 11). 
Whatever you do, keep it heavy.
Until next time, have a wonderful summer, and Up The 
Irons!
A1
This year also marks the return of the Sounds of the 
Underground tour, with Gwar, Chimaira, and Darkest
Dio-era Black Sabbath will 
reunite for a summer tour with 
metal veterans Megadeth and 
Machine Head.

Below are descriptions of five choice active bands and artists from 
Pittsburgh.
Flak: Flak is one of Pittsburghs finest punk bands. Drawing 
influences from a wide array of punk and metal bands from across 
the ages, Flaks ace Instrumentalism and shifting song parts make for 
a very exciting band. The groups first 7 is available at stores such as 
Brave New World, and its first LP should be out soon. 
www.myspace.com/flakpgh.
Tusk lord: Tusk lord is a one-man musical outfit steadily producing 
a prolific and varying output that consistently increases in quality.
His CD, Famililar Trails, came out a while ago; it features songs 
like Sunbeams Piercing the Canopy that call forth impressions of 
abstract images, situations, and feelings. Songs are largely electric; 
they are acoustic-guitar-based but employ a wide array of electronic 
sound generators. A new album is due out in the future. 
www.myspace.com/tusklord.
Caustic Christ: Caustic Christ is a Pittsburgh Institution. Having 
toured extensively around the world, there are many who call CC 
Pittsburghs greatest band. It plays fast hardcore, filled with a rare, 
penetrating energy. Everyone should check out the classic Cant 
Relate LP/CD as well as the bands newest LP Lycanthropy. 
www.myspace.com/causticchrist.
Warzone Womyn: Warzone Womyn is another of Pittsburghs finest 
punk bands. Playing a style of hardcore known as "power violence," 
Warzone Womyn features outstanding songwriting, perfected 
instrument sound, killer vocal delivery, and lyrics to produce mastery 
of all tempos. Songs like Therapy Notes"  available for listening at 
www.myspace.com/warzwonewomyn  are maddening.
DBL D: DBL D is a somewhat new, very exciting improvisatlonal 
band. With no set leader, members play off each other and swing 
collectively in and out of different ideas, as well as in and out of 
traditional rhythms. The band recently released a CD called Initiation 
of the Pulse. Check out www.myspace.com/dblddbld.

Fictitious and religious boy band puts N*SYNC and BSB to shame
UK youngsters release sophomore album
Thought your sweet summer internship at [insert big 
company name here] was a sweet gig? What if you had the 
headlining spot at summer rock festivals and a number-one 
album?
There aren't many bands our age that have reached this 
level of success. In fact, the only one around today that has 
is Arctic Monkeys. When the band's first album, Whatever 
People Say I Am, That's What I Am Not hit stores last 
January, it sold 360,000 copies in its first week, making it the 
fastest-selling debut in UK history. The album painted a bleak 
image of growing up in urban England; taking stabs at the 
abysmal state of pop culture with dicey lines like, "There's 
only music so that theres new ringtones. When released, the 
four band members  lead singer and guitarist Alex Turner, 
guitarist Jamie Cook, drummer Matt Helders, and bassist 
Andy Nicholson  were all under 21. Last Tuesday, a year 
after the success of Whatever, the band released Favourite 
Worst Nightmare, the infinitely hyped follow-up record.
Twenty-one is a weird age to be a rock star, and Arctic 
Monkeys is learning that the hard way. If Whatever was 
a youthful surge against the dementia of modern times, 
Favourite Worst Nightmare is surprisingly more introspective. 
It's a tough balance to try and lay down: Should the group go 
for a mature-sounding second album, or embrace the fact 
that its members are still, in the grand scheme of the music 
industry, youngsters?
The group wrestles with this balance from the opening notes 
of the record. "Brianstorm, the first single and track from 
Nightmare, is wrought with the same dance-y, triplet-charged 
guitar riffs that put spunk behind Whatevers first single, I 
Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor. It is lyrically just as 
nasty and socially conscious, with lines like We can't take 
our eyes off the T-shirts and ties combination." Are we on 
our way to a fresh new sound for the group? Probably not:
See you later, innovator," lead singer Turner mocks. In a fit 
of ADD self-consciousness comes Flourescent Adolescent" 
only several tracks later. Despite the catchy guitar riff that 
dominates the song, the track has more of a southern rock 
feel than it does dance-pop. "The best you ever had is just a 
memory," Turner cries with a nostalgic air. There will never be 
another Whatever People Say, and he knows it.
Although much of the new record fluctuates between these 
two polarities  the old guard of grimy dance-rock and a 
relaxed, more mature vibe  songs like "Do Me A Favour 
and "Old Yellow Bricks" seem to strike the equilibrium that 
the Arctic Monkeys might be searching for. The songs are 
still aggressive, with edgy guitar riffs and ass-kicking drum 
tracks, but have backed off from the recklessness of the 
band's first record. And even though this common ground" 
might seem like a plus  as if the band is finally finding a 
more accessible style  the music is more watered down.
No riff matches the catchiness of Whatever's Fake Tales of 
San Francisco." No melody has the rude-boy grit of "Dancing 
Shoes. In short, nothing on the new record is quite as 
interesting... or daring.
Its really tough to be hard on Arctic Monkeys. The band is 
selling out shows worldwide, and its members are the same 
age as many Carnegie Mellon students. Then again, maybe 
we were all hoping for the brilliant melting pot of songwriting 
arid balls-out energy that the group found on Whatever. There 
are some good things on Favourite Worst Nightmare, but the 
band's juvenile fearlessness isnt one of them.
Altar Boyz, an off-Broadway hit currently on a national tour, 
opened in Pittsburgh last Tuesday at the Byham Theater. 
Intended to resemble the final concert of a boy bands tour, 
the musical simultaneously satirizes both boy bands and 
Christian pop music. Through the energetic opening number, 
We are the Altar Boyz," the audience is introduced to the 
titular boy band. The pop sensation that's sweeping the 
nation consists of Matthew, Mark, Luke, Juan, and Abraham 
(hes Jewish). The group leads the audience in a story of 
what it means to truly be a boy band, religious or not  from 
genesis through final revelations.
Despite the catchy music and captivating choreography it is 
probably the characters that make the musical as charming 
as it is. Theres Matthew, the quintessential boy band leader. 
Big muscles, buzz cut, wifebeater  sound like any boy band 
members youve heard of? Then theres Mark, whose hilarious 
flamboyance highlights his hugely transparent crush on 
Matthew. Luke, the ghetto superstar, just got back from his 
rehab stint, where he was treated for "exhaustion. Juan, the 
poor orphan left on the front steps of a nunnery in Tijuana, is 
desperately trying to find the parents who brought him into 
this vida loca. And, Abraham, the Jewish one, is convinced 
he was brought into the group by accident  but that doesnt 
stop him from coming up with the bands amazing lyrics. 
Commanded by God to Gel thy hair with product and gird 
thy loins with pleather, lest ye skew thyselves to an older 
demographic, which is an abomination before mine eyes, 
the group sets off to conquer the hearts  and souls  of 
preteen girls everywhere. Each member is craftily chosen for 
his special talent in the band. Matthew writes music, Mark 
does choreography, Juan works on costumes, Abraham is the 
lyricist, and Luke... well, he drives the van, hopefully not while 
under the influence of..."exhaustion.
The group performs with the aid of the Soul Sensor DX-12.
The goal during every concert is to reduce, through the bands 
music and message," the number of souls in the audience 
burdened with sin. The Soul Sensor DX-12, a Sony product, 
lets the boys know how many burdened souls are in the room. 
The Boyz race against the clock to save the audience from 
H-E-double-hockey-sticks  but can they save Pittsburgh in 
time?
Tuesday nights performance was phenomenal. As the 
superstition goes, the cast of Altar Boyz must have had 
an atrocious dress rehearsal  judging from an incredible 
opening night. The Altar Boyzs endeavor to mimic an actual 
boy band was successful, to say the least. Members of the 
audience were visibly fighting the urge to scream like teenage 
girls. The choreography was straight out of an N*SYNC video
 one of the better ones, before Justin let his ego get the 
best of him. Most importantly, the performers harmonizing 
abilities far surpassed every boy band of the era. One of the 
highlights of the show was the.song Something About You, 
the requisite ballad sung to a swooning female audience 
member  also a song promoting abstinence. The song was 
hilarious up to its final lines: Until my wedding date, I guess 
Ill just have to master... my own fate."
If satire, witty double entendres, and catchy pop music are up 
your alley, you wont want to miss this show. Theyre the Altar 
Boyz, and theyre going to alter your mind.

Theater linked to collective memory
History professor earns New Directions grant to study Yucatan performances
Paul Eiss, a history professor in the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences, didn't know what to expect when a 
woman from a regional theater in Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula 
told him about some old papers that the recently deceased 
company copyist had kept lying around. I went to his house 
thinking, 'Why not? and found a room filled with scripts 
almost up to my knees," Eiss said. "This 80-year-old man had 
saved every play hed transcribed since he was a teenager. 
Eiss plans to make the plays available in a digital archive, 
as part of a project that recently earned him the highly 
prestigious New Directions Fellowship from the Andrew 
Mellon Institute.
New Directions fellowships are given to professors who have 
finished their post-doctoral studies, but would like to pursue 
research outside of their chosen field. The grant is unusual 
in that it awards money based not on expertise, but on 
potential. Eiss, whose academic interests lie in the cultural 
politics of colonialism and its aftermath, with emphasis on 
how indigenous cultures are represented by their oppressors, 
plans to use the fellowship to pursue performance studies. 
Acquiring training in theater, Eiss hopes, will add a 
necessary dimension to his studies of theater in the Yucatan 
Peninsula, and illuminate the subtle ways in which regional 
theater expresses and records the suffering endured under 
colonialism.
Eiss, who received his undergraduate degree from Princeton 
University in 1990 and completed his Ph.D. at the University 
of Michigan in 2000, has been teaching at Carnegie Mellon 
since he received his doctorate. Not originally drawn to 
theater, Eiss found this research interest through a long chain 
of accidents and chance events. Originally planning to do 
his graduate ethnographic work in Algeria, then Chiapas,
Eiss was forestalled by violent uprisings in both regions and
settled on the Yucatan Peninsula instead. While interviewing 
Yucatecans about historical events, Eiss was struck by how 
often people cited plays that had been written about the 
events, rather than their own memories. Teatio regional," 
said Eiss, or, the regional theater, was obviously a powerful 
medium for people to understand and commemorate difficult 
times in the community."
The fellowship, according to the Andrew Mellon Foundation 
website, is meant to continue through several years and 
promote long-term academic growth and the achievement 
of meaningful results. Over the next couple of years, Eiss 
will work with professors at New York University, Yale, 
and the University of Pittsburgh to develop an extensive 
working knowledge of acting, directing, and other theoretical 
aspects of theater studies. Eiss will also attend international 
conferences focused on cultural representations of theater, 
and will work closely with theater troupes in Latin America, 
participating in workshops and production activities.
H&SS Dean John Lehoczky acknowledged the great honor of 
the fellowship in a press release, calling Eisss achievement, 
as well as the two other New Directions fellowships given to 
Carnegie Mellon professors in the last four years, "a testament 
to the strength of our faculty." The fellowships are particularly 
impressive, Lehoczky added, considering the relatively 
small size of Carnegie Mellons college of humanities. Other 
recipients of the New Directions Fellowship hail from such 
humanities powerhouses as Cornell, Yale, and Princeton, 
among others.
Although Eisss training and work as a historian and 
anthropologist are rooted in traditional academia, he 
believes'very much in the relevance of his research on 
Yucatan theater to regional political struggles occurring
today. "This is an art form with contemporary vitality as 
well as historic importance, a genre that works by relentless 
borrowing of ancient as well as modern theatrical and 
cultural elements," Eiss explained; as an example, he cited 
Yucatan theaters recent tendency to borrow from the plots 
of popular telenovelas, or television soap operas. As well as 
incorporating political themes and cultural trends, Yucatan 
theater is also an active political force in its own right, with 
actors often running for office. The plays themselves create 
a forum for political dialogue  lampooning, satirizing, and 
calling for change both openly and subversively.
When speaking about the Yucatan and the work he hopes 
to accomplish using theater to examine cultural identity, 
Eiss's voice and face are animated with a deep excitement. 
With 15 years of experience doing ethnographic research 
in the Yucatan behind him, Eiss, who speaks Spanish as 
well as Mayan, ultimately hopes to use the New Directions 
grant to give something back to the rich, vibrant culture he 
has studied for so much of his academic career. He sees the 
planned digital archive of plays as a potential inspiration, to 
Yucatan artists seeking to express their complex identity 
as a colonized people, as well as a resource for scholars and 
theater artists everywhere. As a scholar himself, Eiss is also 
just excited to be going back to school. "Usually, academia 
requires you to root yourself further in your chosen area as 
you get older, Eiss said. This is a wonderful opportunity to 
be a student again, in a discipline Im a novice in.

Inside the Carnegie Mellon University Press
Publishing on campus provides opportunities for both writers and students
Many people have heard of the Yale and Harvard university 
presses, but few are aware that Carnegie Mellon has 
a press of its own. Despite the lack of visibility and 
publicity, Carnegie Mellon does have its own press, which 
is responsible (and renowned) for publishing books on 
nonfiction, fiction, and, most prominently, poetry.
Carnegie Mellon English professor Gerry Costanzo founded
the press in 1975, and it has since become an important
publishing icon in the world of university press publications.
Rubn Quintero, a senior in ECE and creative writing, said,
It's a great publication and has a fabulous poetry series.
Quintero has been a member of the University Press for two
years, after enrolling in'the English department's Editing and
Publishing class as a junior. The class gives students
interested in publishing an opportunity to
get some hands-on experience by
contributing to the editing
and publishing stages of
the press. "You get great
exposure to the whole
publishing process, from
formatting the work
itself to interacting and communicating with the authors, 
Quintero said.
In fact, students play an important role within the press. This 
year, out of the class of 10 students, Costanzo chose four to 
be "readers for the press. These students were responsible 
for reading through hundreds of manuscripts and selecting 
appropriate candidates for publication. There were over 
400 submissions this past year. It's a long process, but its 
really fun, Quintero said. The student readers start looking 
through submissions as early as October, and have to have 
read all of them before the end of the first semester. After 
they find a group of manuscripts they think would be good for 
the publication, the students then pass their choices along 
to Costanzo, who has the final say on which manuscripts to 
publish. Quintero said Costanzo has high standards, so 
only the few best are chosen, and its always 
good stuff."
This "good stuff hasn't gone 
unnoticed in the world of writing.
The press published The Language 
of Elk, a collection of short stories
ZhiquanYeo | Photo Staff
by writer Benjamin Percy; it was his first published book. 
Percy recently published his second book, Refresh, Refresh: 
Stories, and the title story was read on NPR, chosen for The 
Best American Short Stories 2006, and awarded a Pushcart 
Prize. Recent books published by the press include Black 
Threads by Jeff Freeman and The Book of Sleep by Eleanor 
Stanford, Quintero added.
With an active publishing company (and class) to its name, 
Carnegie Mellons humanities college may have more to 
offer than meets the eye. I always disagree with the claim 
that our humanities program is Carnegie Mellon's weakest 
academic component; I think the school just advertises itself 
on being so technical," Quintero said.
And after 35 years of publishing, the press continues to 
thrive, despite small funding and a humanities program that 
is frequently overlooked.

Museum of Art's parallel exhibit, Viva Vetro! Glass 
Alive!. Phipps is showcasing glass artist Dale Chihuly, 
known for his elaborate multicolored pieces. After 
spending time in the world-famous .glass factories of 
Venice, Chihuly returned to the United States to help 
establish glassblowing as an art form, in particular the 
use of collaborative teams in glassblowing. By using 
teams to blow glass, Chihuly is able to produce huge, 
elaborate pieces like 40-foot towers of glass or room
sized installations.
Chihuly's work is especially fitting in a natural 
environment like Phipps because of the organic look of 
his art. His pieces often take the form of natural objects 
like shells, reeds, or seeds, and according to Michael 
Sexaver, Phipps's director of communications, one of 
the goals of the exhibition is that the glass pieces "look 
like they grew there." Sexaver said that Chihuly's crew 
visited the conservatory several times to plan the show, 
apd the conservatory has replanted and rearranged 
several plant beds to better complement the art. 
Sexaver expects the exhibit to more than double the 
conservatory's visitors; tickets can be reserved online 
at www.phipps.conservatory.org.

Chihuly would be nowhere without the Venetian glass 
art tradition. Venice has been a center of glassmaking

economy. After Americans learned about Venetian

Before steel and coal jump-started its economy and 
darkened its skies, Pittsburgh was known as the Glass 
City  shipping plate glass, tableware, and lighting 
fictures across the nation. If not for the influence of 
barons like Andrew Carnegie, Pittsburghers might be 
cheering on the Glassers at Heinz Field today.
But glass is making a comeback in Pittsburgh, in the 
form of glass art. 2007 has been dubbed the Year of 
Glass in Pittsburgh, and this summer features many 
exciting glass-related exhibitions and events.
Richard Piacentini, director of the Phipps Conservatory, 
set. this summers events in motion in 2002, when 
he visited an exhibition of glass artist Dale Chihuly's 
work in Chicago. Immediately, Piacentini knew he 
wanted Chihuly in Phipps. Piacentini contacted 
Richard Armstrong at the Carnegie Museum of Art 
to see if the museum would consider holding a glass 
exhibit as well. Armstrong called Karen Johnese at 
the Pittsburgh Glass Center, who asked the Glass Art 
Society to consider holding its 2007 conference in the 
former Glass City  and the foundations were laid for 
a Summer of Glass. Read'on for a list of four exhibits 
of glass art coming this summer to Pittsburgh  from 
Venice to Japan.

On May 10, Phipps Conservatory will be transformed 
into a splendor of glass, leaves, and light in an exhibit

among them  began visiting factories in Venice in 
order to learn glass-making techniques and design 
glass items.
The Carnegie Museum of Art's exhibit, Viva Vetro!
Glass Alive!, focuses on the connections between 
Venice and America since the 1950s. Beginning May 
12, the exhibit features 100 works from Venetian 
and American glass artists, in addition to illustrating 
many Venetian techniques and the American art they 
inspired. The show highlights all kinds of glass art, from 
works based on practical pieces, like chess sets, bowls, 
and chandeliers, to abstract sculptures.
Allure of Japanese Glass
The Pittsburgh Glass Center attracts glass artists 
from all over the world, but its main exhibit this 
summer features emerging Japanese artists, many of 
whom have never had their work shown in America. 
Beginning May 4, the exhibit includes work ranging 
from delicate sculptures that would fit in the palm of 
your hand to large installation pieces.
Until the Glass Center came to Friendship in 2001, glass 
artists in Pittsburgh had nowhere to work. Heather 
McElwee, director of education and exhibitions, said 
that the Center has four studios: the hot shop, where 
artists blow glass; the flameworking studio, where 
beads and marbles are made; the casting studio, where 
stained and-fused glass is made; and the cold shop, 
where artists grind and engrave glass. In addition 
to studio space, the Glass Center hosts exhibitions, 
workshops, and tours.

Metamorphosis: The Life Cycle of a Glass Bead
The Heinz History Center, which also features a 
permanent exhibit on the history of glass in Pittsburgh, 
will hold an exhibit of glass jewelry starting May 5. 
Marianne Filiaggi, a bead artist whose work is part of 
the exhibit, said in an e-mail that the exhibit's purpose 
is to explain the creative process of going from a focal 
bead to a finished piece of jewelry."
Metamorphosis, explained Leslie Kaplan, the president 
of the Three Rivers Glass Beadmakers, will also include 
loose material so visitors can see what glass beads 
feel like. The Three Rivers Glass Beadmakers is an 
organization for glass artists interested in beadmaking' 
which sponsors workshops and supports local artists.
Pittsburghs glass community
The Glass Center has revitalized Pittsburgh's glass art 
community. Filiaggi said in an e-mail, The success 
of the Pittsburgh Glass Center has been a catalyst in 
bringing many master glass teachers to this area.
Since the Glass Center came to town, 2000 glass artists 
have moved into the Pittsburgh area, and McElwee and 
her peers at the Center hope that members of the Glass 
Art Society, in town for the conference, will decide to 
relocate to Pittsburgh. The citys history with glass, low 
cost of living, and growing art community could entice 
enough artists to make Pittsburgh the Glass City once 
again. As Filiaggi said, Its an exciting time to be a 
glass artist!

The Rose Tea CafCalling all nerds: Pittsburgh Comicon
Last weekend, Chewbacca paid a visit to Monroevilles ExpoMart
Despite the number of Asian food delivery options 
available at campusfood.com, many students are still 
left in the mood for something more authentic. With a 
short trip to Squirrel Hill, theyll find The Rose Tea Caf, 
an authentic Taiwanese-style restaurant. Located next 
to Ritas on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill, it offers a 
variety of entres and specialty drinks at reasonable 
prices.
Rose Tea started out as a caf serving bubble tea 
(hence the name), and is still decorated as if it were 
a caf. The chairs have coffee cup cutouts on their 
backs, and the wall decpr includes steaming cups of 
coffee. Despite the western-themed decor, the small 
restaurant has an Asian atmosphere. Taiwanese pop 
music played throughout my whole visit, a nice change 
from the stuff of Skibo or Eat 'n Park.
One of Rose Tea's coolest features is that everything' 
is served family-style. One entre can easily feed two 
people. Each person at the table is brought an empty 
china plate decorated with intricate designs, along 
with a mug of water and utensils (both chopsticks and 
a fork). When the food arrives, it is placed in the center 
of the table on square plates with serving spoons.
The food at The Rose Tea Caf is delicious and 
authentic. The egg rolls are crispy on the outside, 
a contrast of texture with the soft inside. Other 
especially delicious dishes include the green beans 
with garlic, shredded beef with Chinese hot peppers, 
and shredded pork with bamboo shoots. The green 
beans with garlic are garlicky and spicy, and they are 
not intended to be a side dish; one order will cost 
about the same as an entre ($9). Both the shredded 
beef and shredded pork feature tender, flavorful meat, 
although the meats are not actually shredded; they 
are in small chunks that can be eaten easily in one 
bite. Both entres cost about $11 and are well worth 
the visit.
The Caf still offers a large variety of bubble teas and 
milk teas containing tapioca pearls. The drinks cost 
about $4 and are available to go at the counter.
The service at Rose Tea is amazing. The workers are 
all very friendly, and if they notice that a plate has been 
sitting untouched, they offer quickly to take it away 
rather than clearing everything at the end of the meal.
As finals week approaches, take a break from studying 
and head to Rose Tea Caf with a friend to enjoy 
inexpensive and delicious Taiwanese food.

When most people hear about Comicon, the phrase "nerrrrrd 
alert may come to mind. Or just run-of-the-mill confusion. 
Comicon, for those not in the know, is a comic book 
convention, the most famous of which is held annually in San 
Diego. There are also huge comicons in other cities, such as 
Chicago and San Francisco.
Apart from pierogies and sandwiches stuffed with french 
fries, Pittsburgh is also fortunate enough to have a 
medium-sized Comicon of its own, which took place last 
weekend at the ExpoMart in nearby Monroeville. Scott Mark, 
who works at Phantom of the Attic, a comic book store on 
Craig Street, has worked in the store's booth at the Pittsburgh 
Comicon for the past nine years.
Mark described the Pittsburgh Comicon as a large convention 
center filled with comic book dealers who also sell action 
figures (toys make up three quarters of the booths) and some 
artists and writers who are looking to publicize their projects.
I also recently went to a local comicon that was a lot smaller. 
That one consisted mostly of comic book and toy dealers. 
There is also a toy convention every couple of yearsMark 
said.
The primary difference between a medium-sized convention, 
such as Pittsburghs, and a large one, such as San Diegos, 
is the caliber of the conventions special guests. According 
to Mark, the Pittsburgh comicon is usually filled with B-level 
comic book industry writers and artists, and, occasionally, an 
A-lister. Many A-level artists who are invited to Pittsburgh 
Comicon have cancelled their appearances, which Mark 
suspects would be less likely to happen at a more famous 
convention such as San Diegos.
Comicons are also noted for attracting fans of cult classic 
sci-fi or fantasy shows and movies. Think Star Trek, Star 
Wars, and Battlestai Galactica. "Usually, said Mark, we are 
treated to the presence of some some C-level star from a bad 
sci-fi movie, such as the third Jedi, who hangs out in the 
background of one scene  i.e., some no-name actor.
This year, however, Pittsburgh Comicons special guests 
included Peter Mayhew, most famous for his role as 
Chewbacca, the lovable wookie from the original Star Wars 
trilogy, Warren Pygram, also from the original trilogy, and 
Matt Wood, who played the sinister General Grievous in the 
new Star Wars trilogy. This is a huge step up from the usual 
Farscape extra.
Although Pittsburgh Comicons almost-famous actors do have 
drawing power (no pun intended), the main attraction, for 
comic book enthusiasts, are the booths. People come looking 
for certain comics or toys that may not be available at their 
neighborhood comic book stores; due to the number and 
variety of sellers present, Comicon is more likely to have these 
items.
Many people who self-publish original comic creations come 
to Comicon, hoping to make connections with the established 
publishers, artists, and writers who are special guests. To this 
end, portfolio reviews are offered to any aspiring artist. The 
Pittsburgh Comicon website (www.pittsburghcomicon.com) 
states, "Our guests are for the most part more than happy to 
give a look and a word of encouragement to those would-be 
comic stars, but several of our publishers are truly looking to 
fosternew talent.' . .

As summer approaches, youll spend many sleepless nights 
wondering why you decided to take classes and have a job during 
your time off.
Your arch-nemesis will strike you with a water balloon during an 
intimate moment.
Years of training and preparation will pay off when a foul ball 
bounces off your girlfriends head and lands in your lap. Go eBay!
A strip of bacon will successfully run for  and win  the student 
body elections.
Pleading for a larger allowance will fall on deaf ears. Additionally, avoid 
eating any killer tofu.
Watching House for 22 straight hours will give you neck pains and 
make you believe that you are terminally ill.
The most unlikely thing that you can think of will tiappen to someone 
that you have never met. There is a small chance that you may hear 
about it on the Internet.
A giant floating banana will delay the start of exams by 20 minutes.
You will realize that you hate math after you experience the equation 
(200,000 x pieces of paper) + (1,461 x days) = larger sheet of paper.
For no particular reason, you will get out of bed without hitting the 
snooze button half a dozen times.
A bloody nose during your first exam will result in a few sympathy 
points from your professor. Trying to have the same thing happen in 
consequent exams will yield a far different outcome.
After five long years, you will actually manage to graduate with a 
random degree and a QPA in the toilet. So long, suckers!
