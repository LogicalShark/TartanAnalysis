The Carnegie Tartan 
Reaches Fiftieth Year
Just fifty years ago, a few months after the founding of Car
negie Tech, a group of students under the leadership of Fred E. 
Foster presented to the campus the first of some 2000 weekly news
papers. This week the Tartan celebrates its anniversary with the
largest paper Tech has seen since#----------------------------------------------------------
before the war.
The history or Tech is recorded 
in the bound volumes of the Tar
tan. There are the stories of build
ing programs, the development of 
classes and courses offered, the 
growth of a top-notch football 
team, the work of beloved presi
dents, and controversies over 
flange.
Today, as in the past fifty years, 
the staff works hard every week 
to produce a paper which reflects 
the interests and opinions of the 
student body. Its policy as to how 
to accomplish this has varied over 
the years, as student interests have 
varied: During the thirties when 
Tech was a big football school 
and there was more spirit, campus 
politics and organization news 
ade the front page fairly regu
larly. A larger staff made it pos
sible to carry more columns and 
national college news. At that 
time there was a greater demand 
for a womens page, and coverage 
of city news.
During the war, however, the 
paper was necessarily smaller, 
lacked funds and staff, and was 
beset with the problem of keeping 
news light when the world was 
{Jnxious and saddened. Gossip, col
umns and a much larger amount 
of social news made up the paper 
then, with as many pictures as 
their limited financial state would 
permit.

Carnegie Community To Participate 
In Campus-wide Mock Elections
Faculty and voting, non-voting, and foreign students will have an opportunity to 
express their political opinions in a mock election on Thursday, November 1. The ballot
ing, to take place in Skibo from 9:00 to 4:30, will determine the political leanings, not only 
of the campus as a unit, but-of each school and each department. Faculty and student votes
^ will be tallied and reported
Letter From President Warner
October 26, 1956
To All Students at Carnegie:
As you know, one of our primary aims in professional edu
cation at Carnegie is to equip you to grow in professional and 
personal stature and in usefulness as citizens.
One of a citizens primary responsibilities is to take part in 
elections, and I wish to urge all of you who have registered for 
the election on November 6 to vote.
If you live in Pittsburgh or in one of the surrounding com
munities you will be able to vote after classes on Election Day.
If you live in another state you may be able to vote by absentee 
ballot. If you live so far from Pittsburgh that you cannot reach 
your voting place before the polls close and cannot vote by 
absentee ballot, see your department head. He will grant all 
reasonable requests.
I should like to be sure that every eligible voter on the cam
pus has ample opportunity to exercise his right and duty to vote 
for the candidates he feels, will best.serve our country.
Sincerely,
J. C. Warner.
Campus Chest In Second Day 
Of Drive For 100% Support
Campus Chest, Carnegie Tech, today enters the second day of 
the 1956 campaign for funds. This week, October 29 through No
vember 3, sees the culmination of the efforfs of Campus Chest com
mittees in promoting, publicizing, and soliciting for this annual united 
appeal for charities and social#
welfare agencies.
Headed by Evelyn Alessio and 
consisting of approximately four 
hundred students, the Campus 
Chest organization has been pre
paring campaign plans since Sep
tember. The goal set for this years 
drive is one hundred percent par
ticipation among the Tech stu
dent body, thus emphasizing that 
the contribution is secondary to 
the idea that each student in the 
Tech community should lend sup
port to the welfare agencies in 
his society.
Student to Student
In keeping with this idea, the 
funds obtained through the Cam
pus Chest campaign are distrib
uted with the interests of other 
students in mind. Ffifty-five per
cent of these funds will be used 
to benefit students of the United 
States, through the national schol
arship fund for Negro students, 
and students of many other coun
tries, through the World Univer
sity Service.
The remaining forty-five per
cent of the Campus Shest con
tributions remain within the com
munity of Pittsburgh, with the 
exception of a donation of ten 
percent to the United Nations 
childrens fund. The Pittsburgh 
percentage is divided among vari
ous service and welfare agencies 
of the community, medical re
search organizations, and hospi
tals.
Tech Campus Chest has been 
notably successful in past years 
and has been set up as the-model 
Campus Chest organization in the 
nation-wide association of college 
CC drives.
CIT Prepares 
For Elections
In addition to the numerous ac
tivities connected with college 
life, Techites have been busy since 
the beginning of the semester 
with the political campaigns. 
Many have taken an active inter
est in the forthcoming election. 
Groups supporting both candi
dates have been organized and 
functioning since September.
Students for Stevenson, part of 
a nation-wide organization got off 
to a booming start. Sponsoring a 
table at the Activities Fair during 
Freshman Week, the group en
listed many recruits among the 
Frosh. The Democrats have also 
distributed buttons and literature 
in Skibo.
On election day the Students 
for Stevenson will be baby-sit
ting, helping with transportation, 
and door-knocking in the 14th 
Ward. An election night party 
will climax the campus drive. 
Officers for the group are chair
man, Tony Robbi; co-chairman, 
Scott Johnston; 14th Ward chair
man, Stanley Brockstein; secre
tary, Joyce Gunia; and fund-rais
ing chairman, Dick Block.
Students For Ike 
No less industrious are the Stu
dents for Eisenhower, headed by 
Brude Gowens and Noel Kocker. 
The Republican Forces, solely a 
Tech organization, have also cir
culated pamphlets and buttons 
from tables in Skibo and AH,

Tech Blood Donors 
To Get Two Hours
The annual Tech Vets Club 
Blood Drive takes place today in 
the Black Cat Lounge. The blood 
that you donate is badly needed 
and will be used at the Oakland 
Veterans Hospital in less than a 
week.
In order to make it easier to 
visit the donation center, the Di
rector of Student Personnel and 
Welfare, Dr. Raymond E. Parshall, announced that students 
will be given two (2) excused 
hours from class to give blood.
The Red Cross Mobile Unit will 
be open from 9:30 until 4:00, and 
is located in the Black Cat 
Lounge, directly beneath Thistle 
Hall in the gymnasium. Last year 
students and faculty donated a 
total of 100 pints of blood. With 
active cooperation this year it is 
hoped that the figure will be 
doubled.
Conforming with Red Cross po
licy, donors should be at least 21 
years of age, or 18 with a note 
of consent from their parents. 
Those intending to give blood 
should not eat anything fatty or 
rich four hours before or after 
their donation.
Pledging Tallies 
Reveal New High
This year, 37.4% of the fresh
men entering Tech pledged a fra
ternity. Last year 35.6% pledged. 
Perhaps the most interesting of 
the statisticsjconcerned those fresh
man who went to freshman camp. 
Of these, 47% pledged a fratern
ity. In breaking down the statistics 
even further, it was found that 
35% of the commuters who went 
to camp pledged a fraternity 
while an astounding 56% of those 
living in the dorms pledged. This 
last figure of 56% is the highest 
one of its kind in the history of 
fraternities at Tech.
separately.
Leading up to the election 
on Thursday are a series of 
political events sponsored by 
the two political groups on 
campus. Tonight at 8:30 on 
WRCT students from both 
groups will participate in a panel 
to discuss the issue. Like the pan
els last year and similar ones to 
be presented by WRCT this year, 
the program will consist of a half 
hour of presentation of issues on 
the air, an hour for listening 
groups in the dormitories to form
ulate questions and get them to 
the panelists, and from 10:30 to 
11:00 a second panel presentation 
to answer and discuss the ques
tions of the listeners.
Soap Box Campaigning
On Wednesday, the day before 
elections, the groups plan to hold 
soap-box speeches on campus in 
front of Administration Hall or on 
Fine Arts lawn. Thursday night 
the Republican students are stag
ing a rally in the gym, at which 
there will be entertainment and 
political talks. Throughout the 
week WRCT will make spot an
nouncements for both parties.
Behind the mock election are 
Students for Stevenson, Students 
for Eisenhower, Mortar Board, A 
Phi O, WRCT and the Tartan. 
The Committee on Religious Af
fairs and various members of the 
faculty also helped to get the idea 
underway. The results of the elec
tion will be published in the Tar
tan the day of the national elec
tions, so that members of the Tech 
community may compare the Tech 
vote with that of the nation. Be
cause of the nature of the election 
and the length of time they will 
be held on Thursday, a large per
centage of the students and fac
ulty is expcted to participate.

Scot Pedalers Write 
American Travelogue
During the past summer two Tech students, Dick Oden and 
Peter Urbach rode bicycles from Pittsburgh to the west coast. The 
TARTAN has asked them to write an account of their trip.
By Dick Oden and Peter Urbach
At the end of last May we strapped a bunch of clothes, some 
oranges and a tooth brush on the ?----------------------------------------------------------
backs of two English bicycles and 
left from the front steps of Beta 
Sig for California in the direction 
of Campus Cleaners. We got there 
and it was very nice. We saw 
Disneyland and Tijuana and 
things like that.
Questions
Sometimes people ask us how 
we got enough to eat or where we 
slept or about the mountains be
ing awfully steep and the deserts 
hot or about girls and that sort 
of thing. Sometimes they ask 
about flat tires and why we went. 
Sometimes they just cant think 
of any bicycle-riding questions.
We have answers like we had 
six flat tires; it took us eight 
weeks to bike to the Pacific, but 
we didnt go straight or constant
ly and that we found it less 
trouble to go through the hottest 
desert than over the highest 
mountains, so we went quite a bit 
south of the Rockies and through 
the Somoran deserts at the top of 
Mexico. Physically the trip was 
no harder than if we had walked.
With rains in the Southwest 
staying mainly nowhere near the 
plains, we found we could sleep
We went south of the Rockies
on the open ground anywhere. In 
cities sleeping places were hard
er to come by, but with a few 
compromises of standards we al
ways managed to find either gasstation grease pits, alleys, parked 
pickup trucks or drive-in-movies.
Drive-in-movie people dont 
seem to care if you go to sleep 
on your little car plot which you 
get even if you have no car. They 
dont make you leave until the 
next night. Unfortunately we fol
lowed the same batch of movies 
all the way across the country. 
Eight times we watched Lillian 
Roth drink herself to ruin and 
snap back.
How We Ate
Eating was a problem. We 
gave up cooking because we 
couldnt and didnt have any way 
to carry the necessary stuff any
how. Once we caught and ate a 
rabbit. It took five hours. Lots of
times people gave us food, but 
lots of times we had to buy it. In 
the Southwest restaurants are so 
far apart they can be confident 
that hungry people will come to
We saw lots of wild animals
them because there is no place 
else to go. So theyre all expen
sive. What money we made, we 
made by selling drawings. We 
went into cities to fashionable 
residential districts and did pic
tures of houses which we sold to 
the people inside for $5.00 cash. 
There werent any farm jobs to 
be done.
Except for reckless drivers, 
very few of the dangers we ex
pected at the beginning occurred. 
Some drivers tried to run us off 
the roads, and lots of them 
screamed insults to discourage us. 
But if youre confident you were 
born in wedlock and keep to the 
side of the road even drivers dont 
bother you much. We got caught 
in a sandstorm once and also 
poked a hole in the water bag in 
the middle of the desert.
Well-worn sightseeing spots.
We expected rattlesnakes to be 
all over the place, and everyone 
assured us they were, but we only 
saw one. He didnt even rattle 
and went away by himself. We 
saw lots of wild animals, but they 
were all dead by the road where 
cars had squashed them. Of the 
dozens of jackrabbits we passed, 
none was more than three quar
ters of an inch thick.
Student Congress 
Organizes; Elects 
Judiciary Council
Last Wednesday Student Con
gress met to finish electing offi
cers and organizing committees. 
The first order of the day was to 
vote Donna Albertson in as sec
retary.
As the Executive Council had 
previously recommended to the 
Student Congress that it should 
elect a judiciary council, the fol
lowing students were approved at 
the meeting: senior men: Salvadore, Kestner, Aiken; senior wom
en, Evelyn Alessio; junior men: 
Stevenson Jakub; junior women, 
Sally Ambrose.
The organization of the follow
ing committees was also approved 
at the meeting: Campus Chest, 
Election Committee, Rules Com
mittee, Spring Carnival Commit
tee, Leadership Conference Com
mittee, Freshman Orientation 
Committee, Homecoming Commit
tee, Finance Committee, Points 
and Keys Committee, Carnegie 
Union Committee, Constitution 
Committee.
A resolution was passed desig
nating the evening of December 6 
an all-school function, thus can
celling all other scheduled func
tions for that evening. The Mortar 
Boards will be selling tickets to 
the Playhouse production of The 
Desperate Hours, to be given on 
that evening.
The Council voted to give sup
port to the Veterans Blood Drive 
in the form of paying for lunches 
for the Red Cross workers, not to 
exceed $20. The Red Cross will be 
in the field house on Tuesday, 
October 30. Students under the 
age of 21 may not donate, unless 
they have a parental consent slip.
There was a discussion of the 
damage done to Washington and 
Jefferson College grounds. A mo
tion was accepted to refer the 
situation to the Rules Committee 
for investigation. The committees 
findings will be reported to the 
Student Congress at the next 
meeting, the first Wednesday of 
November.
No Dangers
In all wed have to strain pretty 
hard to say we did anything dan
gerous. It was very expedient of 
course to let people think other
wise while we were biking. It 
seems that both of us can pass 
for under sixteen, an ability 
useful for getting into drive-ins 
and swimming pools (where we 
took baths) for practically noth
ing. We kept well shaved (with 
cold canteen water) and as a re
sult looked young enough to illicit 
motherly sympathy from ladies 
who seemed to take us for pitiful, 
abandoned waifs wandering 
around the country.
We were very often fed and 
given things. There were times 
when we could afford to refuse 
invitations or make choices 
among them. We got asked to 
country clubs and restaurants as 
guests of the house and as a re
sult of an absurd amount of news
paper and radio coverage we were 
given all kinds of attention. In 
Kentucky somebody gave us a 
car, gas money and an apartment 
for as long as we liked.
We found we could depend on 
strangers who were unbelievably 
kind and naively trusting. A 
couple we met in Texas left us 
alone in their house to baby-sit 
with their two young children. 
Hillbillies in Tennessee insisted 
we sleep in their bed while they 
slept on the floor. Girls were more 
than kind.
We followed whatever roads 
seemed easiest or most interesting 
and had no particular route or 
goal other than reaching the Pa
cific. As a result we discovered 
things wed have never thought 
to look for. Besides all the wellworn sightseeing spots, we stop
ped to look at things too trivial 
to stop for in a car. You cant 
ride a bike fast enough to miss 
seeing much. Youd miss even less 
if you walked, but of course, that 
is absurd.
Next summer we plan to roller 
skate to Saskatchewan.
Democrats Give Historical View 
Of Democratic Party Character
By Students for Stevenson
In order to understand the character of the Democratic party, 
it is important to realize that its basic credo was established by 
Thomas Jefferson who stressed centralized government. But it is 
to Woodrow Wilson that we must credit the modern concepts of t
?government which has as its in
terests the welfare of all its citi-GOP Supporters 
Contends Adlai 
Contradicts Self
The basic contradictions in the 
military policies recently advo
cated by Adlai Stgevnson are in
dicative of the weaknesses of the 
Democratic platform. These issues 
are of special importance to Tech 
students, many of whom are di
rectly affected by the draft laws.
Adlai Stevenson recently sug
gested that within the near fu
ture the military draft may be 
abolished. This opinion was bas
ed on the grounds that future de
fense will depend on new atomic 
weapons and not on heavy con
centrations of manpower. The ef
fect of this proposed action on 
Western European nations, where 
America is the leader in rearma
ment efforts, can be imagined.
Stevenson Contradictory
At the same time, Stevenson 
states he wants to open negotia
tions to abolish further atomic 
and hydrogen weapon tests. These 
very tests result in improvements 
in what Stevenson contends is the 
crux of our future military 
strength.
This nation is willing and wants 
to lay aside nuclear weapons and 
testing of these weapons, but we 
will do this only when we are 
sure all other countries will ob
serve the agreements. Our nation 
would abide by any treaties, but 
this is no assurance that other 
countries would. Obviously, if the 
Soviet Union decided to start the 
third world war, it wouldnt start 
by setting up a program to test 
experimental weapons, but would 
use bombs it has already proven. 
The present atomic and hydrogen 
tests are vital to American se
curity. We cannot be safe without 
safeguards.
Ikes Stand
President Eisenhower, in his 
address at Hunt Armory on Octo
ber 9, stated that weakness in
vites aggression and strength pre
vents it. We must make plain our 
will to resist aggression before the 
event, not after it, he continued. 
The draft isnt merely an election 
issue, but a matter of safety to 
the nation. We need the man
power, Eisenhower declared, we 
cannot pretend that rockets and 
bombs make brains and hands 
obsolete.
T arquansPlanning 
Successful Year
The W.A.A. Tarquans are out 
for another season. Each Tuesday 
night for the next three weeks, 
there will be a training session 
for those who are interested in 
becoming Tarquan members.
The first of the sessions was 
held last Tuesday night, October 
23. The candidates who are in
experienced will be at practice 
from seven to eight oclock and 
the advanced candidates are there 
from eight to nine oclock.
In order to become a Tarquan 
member, a swimmer is required 
to pass a test given at the end of 
the training period. Some of the 
feats that constitute the test are 
rhythmic swimming, the back
ward somersault, and the sur
face dive. Boys, as well as girls, 
are included in the membership.
As soon as the new members 
are chosen, they will begin re
hearsals for the coming show of 
March 14 to March 16. Last years 
show was a great success and it 
is expected that this years show 
will be the same.
The president of Tarquans is 
Mary Greggs and the advisors are 
Miss Fisk and Virginia Tennant.
To delineate Wilsons policy, we 
must first realize that, although 
he served as leader of the free 
world against the German Kaiser, 
his greatest achievement lies in 
the field of social welfare.
In the years following his 1912 
election up to the war, Wilson aft,-, 
vocated the most significant social 
programs within half  century: In 
his Four-Year Program, he passed 
the Income Tax Amendment for 
proportionate taxation, the Clay
ton Anti-Trust Act tightening con
trol of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission, the Underwood Tariff 
Act which decreased tariffs by 
18%, the Adamson 8-hour bill 
which hegulated the working day, 
and the Federal Reserve Banking 
system which centralized Uniteci 
States economics.
Compounded Foundation
After the war, he advocated as
sistance to war-stricken areas; his 
chief move was the advocacy of 
an international council to discuss 
world issues on a peaceful basis 
the League of Nations.
Now, during the Roosevelt ad
ministrations, the personal beliefs 
of Jefferson, the practical politif i 
of Jackson and the accomplish
ments of Wilson were combined 
for a vigorous social program 
which took our nation out of de
pression and established the Unit
ed States as both an economic and 
social leader of the worlds na
tions.
The results of the Roosevelt ad
ministration: the Social Security 
Act guaranteed pensioners and 
unemployed aid; the Wagnei. 
Connerly Labor Relations Act 
provided collective bargaining for 
unions and a National Labor Re
lations Board; parity was offered 
the farmers; reciprocal trade pro
moted industry and foreign rela
tions; the Tennessee Valley au
thority provided methods for de
velopment of backward and pov
erty-stricken areas in the coun
try.
Wilsons Goal Realized  W
The crowning inception of for
eign policy was, of course, the es
tablishment of the United Na
tions. When the UN became a re
ality in San Francisco, the high
est hopes of Wilson and his ad
herents were metand the whole 
world had some basis for peace
ful collective debate.
With these minutely listed items 
upon which to define the concepts 
of the Democratic party, we ca}) 
realize that it advocates strong 
government leadership in domes
tic and foreign affairs as well as 
direct concern of the government 
in the general welfare of the peo
ple.
It is this policy which has 
brought people into the Demo
cratic fold from all walks of life 
and from all parts of the country.

STUDYING CAN BE BEAUTIFUL
Is studying fugging you? Do you have trouble re
membering names, dates, facts, figures, and the location 
of the library? Dear friends, it need not be so. All you 
have to do is master the simple art of mnemonics.
Mnemonics, as we all know, was invented by the great 
Greek philosopher Mnemon in 526 B.C. Mnemonics, in
cidentally, was only one of the many inventions of this 
fertile Athenian. He is perhaps best known for his in
vention of the staircase, which, as you may imagine, was 
of inestimable value to mankind. Before the staircase, 
people who wished to go from floor to floor had to leap 
from springboards. This meant, of course, that aged and 
infirm persons were forced to live out their lives, willynilly, on the ground floor, and many of them grew cross 
as bears. Especially Demosthenes, who was elected con
sul of Athens three times but never served because he 
was unable to get up to the office of the commissioner 
of oaths on the third floor to be sworn in.
But after Mnemons staircase was invented, Demos
thenes got up to the third floor easy as pie and took the 
oathto Athens sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes, 
his temper shortened by years of confinement to the 
ground floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of 
senseless and costly wars with the Persians, the Visigoths, 
and the Ogallala Sioux. He was voted out of office in 
517 B.C., and Mnemon, who had made his accession pos
sible, was pelted to death with fruit salad in the Duomo.
up
... menfoti'W
But i digress. We were discussing mnemonics, which 
are nothing more than aids to memory  catchwords or 
jingles that help you to remember names, dates, and 
places. For example, any student of American history 
surely knows the little jingle:
Columbus sailed the ocean blue 
In fourteen hundred ninety two.
You see how simple a mnemonic is? There is no rea
son why you cant make up your own. Say, for instance, 
that you are proceeding with American history.
The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock 
In sixteen hundred twenty, doc.
^ (This jingle is especially useful to medical students.)
The next important event is the Boston Tea Party. 
Let us compose a rough-and-ready couplet about that:
Samuel Adams flung the tea 
Into the briny Zuyder Zee.
You can see how simple and useful they are  not 
only for history, but also for current events. For instance,
In nineteen hundred fifty six

to suggestions from the members 
concerning any songs which they 
would particularly like to sing. 
All of the music is kept in its 
own special library in Margaret 
Morrison, and is taken care of 
by a librarian elected by the 
choir.
Each of the choirs seventy 
members had to pass the tryouts 
held in the fall; these are based 
on ability to read music, voice 
quality, and how well the indi
vidual will balance with the rest 
of the group. After the member
ship of the choir was established, 
the following officers were elect
ed: president, Bill Grove; vice 
president, Mary Ann Mikan; 
secretary, Dorothy Roe; and li
brarian, Pat Flannery. Each year 
the group elects a student direc
tor, who has not yet been chosen.
Students at Tech have heard 
the Cameron Choir perform at 
such events as Carnegie Day at 
Homecoming, Call*Day at Spring 
Carnival, and at special chapels, 
such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, 
and Easter. Their outside per
formances this year will include 
visits to the veterans hospitals at 
Butler and Aspinwall. The crown
ing event is their annual formal 
concert, which has always been a 
success in past years.
Indeed, success is to be deserved 
and expected of an enthusiastic, 
well-coordinated group under a 
leader whom they all like anc1 re

Choir merit and receive a great 
deal of admiration for their spirit 
and talent from everyone who has 
ever seen and heard them per
form.
CIT Physics Prof. Advocates 
Making H-Bomb Info Public
By Lincoln Wolfenstein, assistant professor of physics
The current public discussion on H-bomb tests is nothing new 
to the scientists. We have been considering the problem raised by 
these tests for more than two years and many of us long ago reached 
the conclusion that there should be an international agreement to
---------------------------------------------------------?end such tests. The reasons for
ending these tests have become inMarried Students 
Leaders At Tech
Contrary to the popular belief 
that married students live in a 
world apart from the campus, 
Lyn and Bob Carman are two 
very active participants in cam
pus life.
Married in 1955 -at the end of 
Bobs first year of grad school and 
Lyns freshman year in Margaret 
Morrison, they have continued 
their educations. Bob is at present 
teaching physics at Pitt, taking 
courses both there and at Tech. 
A junior in the home economics 
department of MMCC, Lyn is a 
scholarship holder and ranks 
scholastically in the highest ten 
per cent of her class.
Holding down the responsibility 
of a home and school work is job 
enough in itself, but both Lyn and 
Bob make time to maintain an 
active interest in school affairs.
Before graduation from the Phys
ics department of Tech, Bob 
was on the Thistle and Technical 
staffs, a member of ODK, the 
Varsity C Club and captain of 
the track and cross country teams 
for two years. Since then he has 
received many awards as an out
standing distance runner ar*d is 
now coach of Techs cross country 
team.
Lyn is a member of the Home 
Economics Club, Phi Tau Gamma, 
and works on the Tartan and 
Thistle staffs.
That Feeling of Belonging
When asked how the student 
body could obtain this same in
terest, they replied that, Having 
much enthusiasm for Carnegie 
Tech is almost impossible for the 
student who sees only the inside 
of the classrooms. We believe that 
it is important for the student to 
have a feeling of belonging to a 
Tech group or even just a special 
group of classmates. But still 
more important is that he have a 
feeling of belonging to the whole 
student body  the freshman 
camp is a step in this direction.
Aside from their campus activi
ties, Lyn and Bob enjoy taking 
long walks, bicycling, reading, 
home decorating, making enamel
ed gifts and finding God together.
It is interesting to note that Lyn 
also shares Bobs interest in run
ning. Last summer she took third 
place in a running event at 
Kennywood Park. As further 
proof of Lyns ability  the girl 
who took first place in this race 
later won the National AAU 
Championship. Although they oc
casionally run together, Lyn does 
not run the 50-70 miles a week 
that Bob does.
W&J Barbers 
Scalp Freshman
The license number was Ohio 
PP 2018. This was all our hero 
could catch, for two foreign | 
strong-arms hustled him quickly 
into the unfamiliar red Ford con
vertible, as he passed the Union 
on his way home from a Republi
can rally.
As they speeded toward the 
unknown destination, the innocent 
and reportedly sober Tech fresh
man futilely interrogated his husky 
companions; it wasnt until they 
reached the hide-out, a darkened 
Mellon Dormitory in Washington, 
Pa., that he learned that his 
snatchers were not Democrats
The clever hero of our tale 
suffered insult on injury at the 
hands of the barbarous Presi
dents; after watching his dark 
curls tumble to the floor to the 
buzz of electric clippers, he was 
compelled to observe a large 
W & J in finger paints being 
marked on his chest.
But the Scottish fight of the 
Tech man within him burst 
through his terror to renew his 
courage and strength. When the 
radicals, plotting future barbering 
raids, left him alone, he method
ically smashed the electric clip
pers and escaped to the nearest 
Greyhound bus terminal.
Hailed from Near and Far
There is a pleasant side to all 
woeful tales: our martyr to the 
Tech cause won Pittsburgh-wide 
fame. Before and After shots, 
appeared in both' the Sun-Telegraph and the Post-Gazette, and at 
11:00 last Friday he appeared in 
person on KDKA.
In connection with this and 
other raids by the Presidents, 
John Kestner had appeared ear
lier on a Friday evening KDKA 
telecast. This kidnapping climaxed 
more than a week of raids be
tween W & J and Tech. Incident
ally, our hero was the illustrious 
young co-chairman of the Tech 
Students for Eisenhower organiza
tion, Bruce Gowens.
Also kidnapped by the infa
mous J boys was freshman Jack 
Neff. However, this enterprising 
lad avaoided the vindictive barber 
by escaping out of a third-floor 
window on knotted sheets.
Pi Delta Epsilon 
Initiates WRCT
By RON ABRAMS
On Sunday, October 21, WRCT 
was initiated into Pi Delta Epsilon, 
the publications honorary. To us 
at the station, this meant that at 
last the Tartan, the Thistle, the 
Scot, and the Technical considersidered us ready.
Our new policy partially ex
plains this attitude. It is: WRCT 
Follows Tech. With the exception 
of Homecoming and Spring Car
nival, WRCT broadcasts every
thing for and about Tech that it is 
possible to cover.
Last Spring Carnival, though we 
were off the air over the week
end, we produced a fifteen-minute tape-recorded broadcas about 
SnS, the buggy races, and the 
booth-building contest with in
terviews of Tech students partici
pating. This show was played back 
a couple days later over KDKA 
as well ac WRCT.

creasingly apparent in recent 
months. These are the main rea
sons:
1. An agreement to an interna
tional ban on all large-scale nu
clear weapons tests would be a 
break in the ^ears of stalled ne
gotiations on disarmament. This 
agreement could be put into effect 
immediately because it requires a 
minimum of new and unconven
tional enforcement methods. This 
action alone could be a first sf.ep 
towards the more general arms 
control we hope for.
2. Because the basic scientific 
principles on which thermo-nucle
ar bombs are based are now wide
ly known, the number of different 
countries which possess these 
weapons is likely to increase, un
less test explossions are stopped 
now.
3. The radioactivity spread by 
continued tests may prove harm
ful to the health of people every
where. While some scientists be
lieve that little harm will be done, 
the truth is that no one really 
knows how great the harm may 
be. If tests are continued, there 
is a possibility that serious radio
active contamination may be pro
duced before the true extent of 
the danger is known.
Inspection System
Statements issued against a ban 
on tests have emphasized that no 
agreement should be made that 
did not involve an inspection sys| tem. The present proposal, how
ever, is to ban those large-scale 
tests, which can be detected by 
| long-range monitoring devices 
I which are already in use. It is to 
! be hoped that as a next step an ini ternational agreement could be 
j reached banning all nuclear bomb 
tests and including a very limited 
| inspection system which might be 
I sufficient for detecting small-scale 
tests.
The other argument against 
banning tests is that an advantage 
could be gained by violating the 
agreement even though the viola
tion would be immediately de, tected. This advantage would be 
| minimized by the continuation of 
I research work in this country, 
j While this may be a real risk, I 
believe that the risks involved in 
a continuation of the present situ
ation are immensely greater. In 
the world of the H-bomb there is 
no course which is free of any 
risk.
Americans Should Be Informed
The welfare of the Americans 
people and the destiny of mankind 
are dependent on the manner in 
which men use nuclear energy. It 
} is fitting and necessary that free 
j men discuss this most important 
I question freely. It is the duty of 
| the officials of a democratic nation 
! to present to the people the facts 
without distortion and the uncer
tainties without disguises. Most 
scientists are deeply disturbed that 
this has not been done so far.

Seven Teehites Visit Europe, 
YMCA Sponsors Extensive Trip
With the co-operation of the Specialized British Travel Agency, 
a group chaperoned by Professor Dawes of the history department 
and consisting of one architect, three P&Ds, two music majors, one 
dramat, and two students from another college, visited Europe this 
summer from July 8 to August 27.?
The purpose of this trip, sponsored
by the YMCA, was to bring Fine 
Arts students closer to the archi
tecture, paintings, and music of 
Western Europe.
Besides seei.ig the run of the 
mill tourist attractions, the 
group visited such art centers as 
the Tate and National Art Galler
ies of London, the Uffizel and Pitti 
Galleries of Florence, the Doge 
Palace in Venice, the Modern Art 
and Rigks Museums in Amster
dam, and the Aixeen-Provence 
gallery of Van Gogh paintings. In 
the last, they saw the actual scenes 
he painted which were used in 
the film of his life.
Plays and Operas
The group saw plays by T. S. 
Eliot while they v ere in London, 
and by Shakespeare while at 
Stratford-on-Avon. There were 
operas such as Aida in Rome, 
Mozart's Don Giovanni in Salz
burg, Austria, and two of Wag
ners at the Opera Festival in Bay
reuth, Germany.
Indeed an enjoyable attraction 
was the Chettenham Music Fes
tival and the concert by the Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra at Ham
burg. The group even participated 
in study classes at Oxford Univer
sity.
Travelers View
The general impression of the 
travelers was that the accommo
dations were good and the trip a 
success despite minor irritations 
which accompany any trip. The 
students remarked that the trip 
brought to reality what they had 
studied. It was an excellent and 
invaluable supplement to their 
books.
Plans are now being made for 
another trip this summer and will 
be announced before Thanksgiv
ing. Students interested in being 
selected 4may contact Professor 
Kimberly or Professor Dawes, in 
104 and 105 Fine Arts, respec

[continued from page 1] 
ly-knit, suavely-tied party of the 
GOP which follows one general 
policy, usually behind one man; 
rather, the Democratic party is a 
regional party with its many can
didates advocating their singular 
home interests, but assuring that 
they try to complement national 
feelings.
Local Stands United
So that while there are regional 
differences such as the Statesrighter segregationists in the 
South who wish to solve the prob
lem peacefully, there are the Joe 
Clarks in Pennsylvania who take 
the strongest stands in iavor of 
civil rights that any man has tak
en jn the country today with the 
exception of Senator Herbert Leh
man of New York. Through co
operation of all areas, such prob
lems will eventually be solved 
but it is only through a party of 
national character that such a goal 
may be achieved.
What is then significant about 
the Democratic party is that no 
one person can claim sole leader
ship of the partyit is not a party 
of sudden change and quick re
verses that may lead to hypoc
risy. It took a period of 40 years 
from Wilson to Truman for the
welfare policies to form firm 
stands on social security. It is a 
party which reflects nuances of 
progressive government that de
velop or.ly through time.
The Party of Many
Thus the Democratic party 
would never hope for such a man 
as Dwight Eisenhower to reshape 
the policy of the party as the GOP 
seems to claim Ike has done. Such 
a policy shows either that the 
party of the past has been rather 
completely ineffectual or tnat said 
change is only an exterior one.
For while slogans may change 
rapidly, we doubt that men of 
strong political convictions such 
as the Jenners and McCarthys and 
McCarrans will change because 
the President turns his Pepsodent 
smile on them. And the Eisen
hower myth is greater than the
manfor it extends to hid^ the 
true character of a party that has 
been changed only by Madison 
Avenue advertisers.
Yes, the Democratic Party ad
vocates strong central government 
but it is a government based on 
the desires of the people and run 
for the benefit of all those who 
have carried it into office in,,the 
past. Voters for the GOP fhiist 
rely solely on the trusting charac
ter of Eisenhower.
That is why Eisenhower looks 
like the next President of the 
United States according to op
timistic Republican sources and 
pessimistic Demoacratic dffices; it 
is also why so many people fell 
that no matter who the President 
may be, the Congress will be D|"nocratic.

Looking For Girls 
To Help Y-Teens
An extremely rewarding and 
worthwhile activity for students 
with progressive attitudes and an 
affinity for young people is the 
job of Y-Teens advisor.
The Pittsburgh Y sponsors a 
number of Y-Teen organizations 
and is looking for interested girls 
to act either as advisor to a club, 
instructor of some particular skill, 
or chaperone and/or planner of 
co-ed evening canteen.
The jobs require only as much 
time as the students are willing to 
put in, and are varied enough to 
suit a number of interests and 
skills. As advisor, the student 
works directly and along with the 
teenagers, although there is a Y 
supervisor to guide and help her.
If complete charge of a group 
is too time-consuming, the teach
ing of a particular skill, such as 
drawing, dancing, or athletics, can 
be limited to suit the students 
time schedule. Working with the 
evening groups is a highly enjoy
able experience, for it involves 
helping the youngsters to mix in 
a social, co-educational group. If 
students prefer to work indirectly 
with the young people in the Y, 
there are many jobs of planning 
available.
Information about the jobs 
may be obtained from Miss Ruth 
Shinn, Co-ordinator of Religious 
Activities, at her office in the 
Union.
Unusual opportunities for rapid 
professional growth and advance
ment at Melpar, Inc., one of the 
Nations leading electronic research 
and development organizations, will 
be detailed to interested engineer
ing, math and physics majors in a 
series of interviews to be held on 
campus soon.
A subsidiary of Westinghouse Air 
Brake Company, Melpar is now en
gaged in a program of expansion 
involving substantial increases in 
staff and'facilities.
Despite Melpars rapid expansion, 
the highest standards of personnel 
selection are constantly main
tained. This selective process has 
produced a vigorous organization 
of great experience and competence 
in all fields of electronics.
Younger men who wish to apply 
their engineering knowledge to 
problems of a varied and challeng
ing nature are required to fill im
portant posts in Melpar project 
groups. Plan to interview the Mel
par representative when he visits 
your campus.
No Waiting For "Automatic 
Advancement at Melpar
At Melpar there is no waiting 
period for automatic advance
ment. Instead, an engineer, regard
less of his age or tenure, may move 
ahead as rapidly as his skill and 
performance dictate. Each engi
neers achievement is reviewed at
least twice a year. In this manner 
engineers deserving advancement 
can be quickly spotted and pro
moted. As soon as an engineer is 
ready for more  complex responsi
bilities they are given him.

EE-ME Meeting
The AIEE, in conjunction with 
ASME, is holding its first joint 
Seting of the fall semester on 
Tuesday, October 30, in Porter 
Hall 100 at 8:00 p.m.
Featured at the meeting will be 
an address by a representative of 
Boeing Aircraft from Seattle, 
Washington. The subject will be 
the role of the graduate EE or ME 
in the aircraft industry. It should 
be of particular interest to stu
dents since we in this part of the 
r^ion know very little of the air
craft industry.
After the meeting students will 
have an opportunity to speak per
sonally with the representative of 
Boeing at the smoker held in one 
of the fraternity houses. Refresh
ments will be served. The location 
of the smoker will be announced 
at the meeting. Undergraduates, 
graduate students and faculty 
members are invited.
Students are also reminded of 
Student Night, November 7, at 8:00 
in Mellon Institute. It is a meeting 
of the Pittsburgh chapter of the 
American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers to which students are 
invited. Don Guenther of Westinghouse will discuss materials 
engineering. In particular this 
covers magnetic and dielectric ma
terials and their use in magnetic 
Ufci dielectric amplifiers. The lev
el of the talk is directed to the 
understanding of the student. 
Everyone is welcome.
Hillel
For the first time Hillel offers 
a course of eleven lectures in 
Great Living Religions Of The 
World. The course will be pre
sented on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. 
in the YMHA Building, 315 S. 
Bellefield Ave., Oakland with Dr. 
Henry A. Fischel as lecturer.
Thursday, November 1, is the date 
of the first lecture.
Becoming exceedingly popular 
among the Hillelites are the bi
monthly brunches which are held 
at Carnegie Union. Following the 
brunch, which lasts from 12:00 to 
1:00 p.m., an outstanding Pitts
burgh personality is presented in 
the series, Men And Their 
Ideas. The speakers and dates 
for the next three brunches are

And finally, the first monthly 
Sabbath Banquet and Service was 
well attended and proved to be 
a great success. More information

Carnegie Library 
Extends Lending 
To All Allegheny
Students commuting from out
side the city limits to Tech, as 
well as to the other Pittsburgh 
colleges, will be glad to hear that 
the Carnegie Library of Pitts
burgh has changed its lending pol
icies. Previously, Allegheny 
County was one of two counties 
in the United States which did 
not provide free library privi
leges for all county residents.
This was a great problem to 
students who were often in need 
of the facilities of a library 
larger and more complete than 
the ones in their particular school. 
This year the new county budget 
of $225,000 includes assistance to 
Carnegie Library, enabling it to 
extend free service to everyone 
in the county.
Students living on campus will 
not be affected by this new policy 
since they will be able to borrow 
books on their student cards, as 
before. For commuters, however, 
it is an important move, as those 
who have either had to do all

Exhibits Drawings 
Of Tech Artists
An exhibition of recent paint
ings and drawings by ten artists 
all graduates of the department 
of painting and designis being 
held in the Hi wlett Gallery, Col
lege of Fine Arts, October 15-November 2.
The ten artists, all graduates 
of Tech from 1947 to 1954, are 
Bernice Berman and Betty Voelker of Pittsburgh and Dorothy 
Cantor, Allan Clarke, Arthur 
Elias, Joseph Groell, Gilliam Jagger, Phillip Pearlstein, Theophil 
Repke, and Andy Warhol, all of 
New York City.
Several of the exhibiting art
ists have had considerable suc
cess in the professional world of 
painting. Phillip Pearlstein was 
selected by Clement Greensburg 
as one of the 10 most promising 
New York painters in 1954. Ar
thur Elias has had successful ex
hibitions in Paris, France, and 
many galleries in the United 
States. Allan Clarke, in addition 
to having several one-man shows 
in New York, Ohio, and Pennsyl
vania, and showing his work 
successfully in a number of com
petitive exhibitions, has achieved 
distinction as an educator. He has 
taught at the University of New 
Hampshire, Miami University, 
Pratt Institute and the City Col
lege of New York. Andy Warhol, 
born in Pittsburgh, has had sev
eral illustrations reproduced in 
the Graphic Annual, 1953, a mag
azine of international distribu
tion.
Institute Institutes 
Saturday Concerts
A group of four concerts featur
ing baroque and renaissance music by The Saturday Consort will 
be presented by the department 
of fine arts, Carnegie Institute, in 
painting Gallery A.
The first program on November 
3, 1956, will be devoted to English 
music from Chaucer to Milton, 
and the second, on December I,
1956, to French music from the 
Courts of Burgundy and Ver
sailles. A third concert of German 
music of the Renaissance and Re
formation will be held on Feb
ruary 2, 1957, while on March 16,
1957, the final program will in
clude works by Bach and his con
temporaries.
All of these Saturday afternoon 
concerts will begin at 3:30 and run 
approximately one hour in length.
History of Consort
The Saturday Consort began 
several years ago in Pittsburgh, 
when a group of professional mu
sicians decided to devote Saturday 
evenings to the performance of 
early music on instruments ap
propriate to the time. When they 
discovered that others also en
joyed this type of music, they be
gan a concert group. The Saturday 
Consort has performed in concerts, 
on radio and on television in Pitts
burgh; and in New York they 
have given a Town Hall perform
ance in addition to several cham
ber concerts.
In instrumental resources, the 
Consort is unique in this country. 
The group includes a full consort 
(ensemble) of recorders. There are 
over fifty recorders in the groups 
collection. Among the half-dozen 
keyboard instruments are two 
antique instruments in perfect 
playing condition. The pentagonal 
virginal of cypress wood was 
made in Italy in the sixteenth cen
tury. The beautifully decorated 
harpsichord is especially note
worthy for the lovely pastoral 
scene painted on the inside of its 
lid. This instrument was made in 
Italy in 1780 by Vincenzo Sodi.

Use Your Vote
In a time of international tension and domestic 
pressures, the stand which the two parties are 
taking on various political issues should be given 
intensive consideration, not only by those eligible 
to vote, but by all people who will be affected 
by the policies of the 1957 administration.
While both parties are middle-of-the-road liberal 
and hold similar views on many of the domestic 
issues, it is becoming apparent that voting this 
year will not be just a matter of flipping a coin.
At home were prosperous and comfortable, and 
most of the domestic decisions are not going to 
affect vitally a large number of people. Probably 
we can ride along quite well with either party 
(this is not to say that the domestic issues are not 
important, for there are particular groups ex
tremely concerned about national and local poli
cies which may affect them).
But the international scene is such that our 
decisions and policies will determine those of the 
rest of the world. The issues are not black and 
whiteits more than just H bomb or not. Diplo
macy is one of the most delicate jobs, and requires 
a great deal of understanding and tact on the part 
of the president and state department.
Its more than merely trying tactfully to get 
along w'ith other nations. At the same time, it 
demands that the president and state department 
(and the country) not assume that America is so 
big and strong and right that we can throw our 
power around. It is utterly essential to everyone on this campus and 
in the world that we have a good foreign policy, one that is firm 
but not narrow. We must show the people of the world that we 
are willing to work with them as a team, and to consider their 
ideas with the understanding that they are as capable as we at 
finding solutions to the problems which are so vital to all of us.
It is not our place to express a political opinion herewe havent 
the knowledge or experience. Both the policies of Eisenhower and 
Stevenson may fit in with our own humble opinions expressed above. 
But the issues have been covered by experienced and educated writers 
in local and national newspapers and in leading news magazines, 
all of which may be found in the main library. We strongly advo
cate, especially to voters, but also to those who will be voting in a 
few years and to the foreign students on campus, the investigation 
of the political situation in the remaining days before the election.
The entire faculty and student body, including non-voters, wrill 
have a chance to express their preference in the mock elections on 
Thursday (see page one), and the results of the election, even if 
they turn out to be contrary to the national results, should be il
luminating. The importance of the elections and sufficient pre
liminary investigation cannot be expressed too strongly. We ask 
all voters to vote carefully and wisely, and to make use of that 
excellent privilege we have of choosing our leaders. Ultimately, the 
national policies rest on the people.

Neivs Review
Wham You Have?
This, our fiftieth anniversary, might be a good time to talk 
briefly about our editorial policies and intentions for the year.
In our editorials so far this fall, wre have discussed individual 
topics which we felt deserved attention, but certain matters of special 
importance to the Tech community have been avoided up to now 
for several reasons. Comments we would make concerning administra
tive policies have been arrested by information that the administra
tion is doing something about issues raised last year such as, for 
instance, the integration of the colleges. Were waiting to find out 
just what the something is.
We wranted to give the new Student Council a chance to get 
started before we attackedor praised it. We are beginning to 
wonder, however, if they are ever going to get to more worthwhile 
projects than coat hangers andinevitablydrinking in the frater
nities during all-school events.
Throughout the year we will endeavor to express the opinions 
of the student body. Letters from our readers, however, make our 
task much easier and insure a true picture of campus sentiment.
Editor, the Tartan:
Your editorial about News Review in last 
weeks Tartan points out what I agree is an unsolvable problem in relation to news summaries. 
A summary can present little more than the facts, 
but in order that any person can understand an 
issue, he must evaluate many peoples arguments, 
both in terms of the facts apparent from each re
porters views and in terms of the motives and 
personalities of the reporters. It is my belief that 
the assimilation of all the arguments on a national 
issue can only be done by each individual for 
himself.
My feelings about national news in the Tartan 
concur with my beliefs. You may find other stu
dents feei differently, but I do not care at all for 
national issues, even though I am very interested in 
what is happening on campus. Thus you would be 
pleasing me if you eliminated the national news 
and devoted the space to campus affairs.
I hope you receive enough opinions from other 
students to help you discover what to do about 
your column.
% Sincerely yours, 
Lincoln Bragg

Things
By Jo Todes and Carl Arendt
Since this is the first time around, perhaps wed 
better explain what were going to do here. The 
whole idea is to comment on things that are hap
pening that would never make the front page 
a category that can include almost anything inter
esting. If youd like to comment, either on T.T.A.H. 
or on us, go right ahead. In a letter or privately, 
please.
Weve been wondering about the lettering on the 
sidewalk across the Cutthe student council elec
tions had better be held on October 2 next year, 
or someone is going to be mighty fouled up. They 
kept telling the artist to use washable paint, but 
he was worried that it might rain.
Michelangelo Bomb-Shelter
Panhel was held last Saturday night in the cen
ter of the citys most luxurious bomb-shelter. The 
Webster Hall Hotel is trading in their old, Moorish 
lobby for a new, all modern model. But with the 
I job still going on, it looks as though Michelangelo 
! had quit halfway through the Sistine Chapel. The 
coffee shop is big and beautiful now though, and 
features snowy white linen which the waitresses 
changes while-u-wait. Recommended for after the 
dance or show.
Cwens and Scimitars have been discussing the 
results of Freshman Week, and one of the big 
headaches it seems was the deans and presidents 
receptions. The problem? Too many people! We 
have been informed that coat racks for the gym 
dances have been ordered and are on their way.
Wondering where all the terrific posters for all
campus events like Homecoming come from (they 
spring up over night), we investigated and found a 
small, but noisy and determined group of P&Ds 
who are also members of Mortarboard and ODK. 
They can be found at strange hours, plying their 
trade in secluded cubbyholes at Morewood Gardens.
Public Opinion
Donkey Or Elephant
By Alex Federowicz
Contrary to the opinions of many of the people 
interviewed, there are two political parties which 
are fighting each other tooth and nail in the present 
presidential race. From the sampling of the e?g|ipus which w^as taken, we are in the midst or a 
Republican stronghold, but the Democrats are not 
an inactive minority.
Both parties have held well attended political 
rallies on campus and supporters of both candi
dates are just as outspoken about the relative 
merits of their own candidates and faults of the 
opposition. Take for instance a typical interview 
of a supporter of candidate Stevenhower of the 
Republicrat party:
Hello sir, Im from the Tartan and am in
forming a survey of campus opinions on the major 
campaign issues. Would you please tell me which 
candidate you are supporting and how you feel on 
such campaign issues as farm price supports, hy
drogen bomb tests, free silver, foreign policy, in
creased social security and higher government 
spending.
His answer: These are all campaign issues on 
which my candidate Stevenhower has spoken on 
with utmost authority and intelligence. I neednt 
repeat his words again as you well known w^it 
they are. Is free silver still an issue?
Party or Man?
Actually, the type of answer depicted above 
was received in very few instances. This inter
viewer noticed that Tech students are surprisingly 
well informed on and interested in most of the 
leading campaign issues. One of these which has 
not yet been noted here is whether it is more im
portant to vote for the party or the man. Steven
sons supporters insist that the party is the more 
important while Eisenhowers backers say that fie 
man is the important item. This is simply an in
dication of the fact that the Republicans have the 
much more outstanding and famous of the two 
major candidates. This is a fact to which most 
logical thinking Democrats are forced to agree. 
Stevenson was nationally unknown ten years ago 
while Eisenhower was one of our leading five star 
generals. ' ... p
Another interesting observation on the cam
paigns made by several people is the effect which 
the fact that the Republicans are now in power j&s 
had on the way that the two candidates are pre
senting the issues. The Democrats say that the 
Republicans have made a mess in Washington 
which will take another four years for them to 
clean up. They have completely muddled our 
foreign affairs, practically bankrupted the farmer, 
sent small business into a major depression, etc.
Thrusts and Counters
On the other hand, the Republicans are saying 
that the country is in the greatest period of peace, 
prosperity and progress that it has ever knorvi, 
and that if they remain in power it will continue 
on this path. They are especially quick to point 
out that Democrats have been in the White House 
during the past three wars.
When asked who was in power when the pros
perity started, a Republican will answer that there 
was a wTar on at the time, at which point the 
Democrats start crying Remember October 1929. 
What a discussion between a Republican and a 
Democrat really boils down to is a ju-jitsu match; 
for every thrust there is a counter-thrust and 0 
that counter-thrust there is a counter-counter
thrust, ad infinitum.
A really basic difference between the platforms 
of the two partiesif one does existis that one 
is the more radical platform of a party trying to 
get back into power, while the other is the plat
form of a party which believes that it will be 
staying in power by continuing and modifying its 
policies of the past four years. Unfortunately, no 
mathematical formula exists for absolutely measur
ing which party should win the election on jtfJS 
merits, and if one did, then each party would 
have their own.
Right now theyre producing posters urging you to 
contribute to Campus Chest, which is a very good 
idea.
For prospective trick-or-treaters, we offer a list 
of good places to avoid on your search for goodies. 
First, Machinery Halltheyre always burning 
something thereyou never know . . . Second, 
the Drugstoreactually this is O.K. if you retCy 
want book covers . . . Engineering Hallthe sulphorous odor is uncomfortable and those lab ex
perimentswell! . . . the Faculty Clubespecially 
for female Halloweeners; its like a fraternity 
house with a better oiled approach . . .
Some of 55s campus personalities are still on 
campus. Ed Feigenbaum and Ed Pasierb are still 
cohorts, this time, in Techs illustrious grad school, 
and Sylvia Fasick (Redding, now) can be seen in
structing Maggie Murph sophomores in biology labs.
There is no truth to the rumor that the P^ D 
department is offering a new course called Campus 
Painting I.

Years Of Tartans Tell Tech History
Highlights From The Past Show'Mock Vote Misses 
Campus Problems A re Same Now
% Since this is the.fiftieth anniversary of the Tartan, the staff de
cided to publish a special insert in way of celebration.
Contained in these four pages are stories lifted from back is
sues, 1906-1956 inclusive. Many hours were spent reading through 
library volumes and choosing^ 
items which could be of particu
lar interest today or could in some 
condensed fashion tell the story 
of the paper of the school.
Many of the stories in contrast 
with todays news show how much 
school has changed over the 
years. At the same time they show 
that present day campus problems 
parallel those of in past years. In 
putting together this insert the 
staff tried to bring out contrasts 
and comparisons as well as to 
present interesting reading.
The problem of pictures was by 
far the largest worry. Since it 
would be next to impossible to re
produce those in the old Tartans,
<ly those on file could be used.
With the great wealth of ma
terial to be found, it was a dif
ficult job to decide which stories 
should be used. Much credit and 
many thanks should go to Lyn 
Carman, Kay Melenyzer and Barb 
Robeson for their work.
Tartan Greiv 
1With School
Editorial from April 12, 1916 
issue.
The Tartan was first edited in
1906, and during its days of 
swaddling clothes, was dragged 
through the mire-pits on the road 
to student favor and a permanent 
foundation. Freedom of speech 
has ever been the ideal of the 
(Dartan. It exists as an organ 
through which any student may 
speak his mind. No restraint is 
made. The paper as an entity of 
our school life exists for the 
pleasure and benefit of the stu,.{fent body; and it is yours, to ne
glect or value, as your poorer or 
better, j udgment may dictate.
One can scarcely realize how 
exceedingly difficult it is to orig
inate a new paper, establish it 
<i>oh a working basis and meet 
all situations to the satisfaction 
of the readers. Fred E. Foster, 
the founder and first editor-inchief, must have been an ingen
ius fellow.
The early issues, from 1906- 
1912, were, printed in magazine 
size, most of them being 12 page 
copies. Their content was unique. 
Aside from the general school 
news, a daily class schedule ocf^ipied a whole page. That in it
self throws a little sidelight upon 
the attendance, for were we to 
run a daily schedule, we should 
have to print a weekly schedul 
and not a weekly newspaper 
was during these days that our 
old friend the slide-rule, came in
to vogue; and we find these earl
ier copies of the Tartan with one 
or two pages devoted to exercises 
in the use of the slide rule. A 
3P|irtoon page gave the paper a 
push and go to it that was bound 
to take. The Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School also ran a sec
tion at that time.
Today the Tartan stands in 
equal rank with any of the pres
ent day college and university 
publications. It covers the entire 
cycle of student activities; no 
phase of school life is too meager 
for its columns. And though we 
^ay say, that it is not thorough
ly hardened into the bone of se
curity, yet we are proud of it.

Thieves Threaten 
Freedom of Press 
Tartans Stolen
April 23, 1940  Organized 
bands of Big Three members, 
located in spots where the Tartan 
is usually distributed, stole 1,500 
papers, and started a riot in the 
basement of Industries Hall in an 
effort to prevent copies of the 
Tartan from reaching students.
The material that they were at
tempting to prevent from reach
ing the campus was a statement 
by the Independent Party in 
which proof was shown that the 
Big Three had used false ath
letic cards during the last elec
tion.
Papers, as they were stolen, 
were placed in lockers in Indus
tries Hall. Big Three gangs 
stood in the neighborhood of the 
points of distribution to confiscate 
the papers as they came. The dis
tribution staff of the Tartan lock
ed the remainder of the papers in 
the Pattern Shop but a group of 
Big Three members attempted 
to force their way into the shop. 
They were stopped by some Inde
pendents who happened to be 
near. A fight resulted in which a 
few students we/e bruised.

Fraternities Try 
Early Rushing; 
Results Indecisive
September 20, 1938Pre-season 
rushing, inaugurated this year by 
Interfraternity Council, may prove 
to be just another noble experi
ment as a last minute count of 
the total number of men pledging 
the twelve houses on the campus 
has indicated. Up to the time that 
the Tartan went to press only 90 
men had gone fraternity, with two 
houses not reporting. This num
ber of pledges while not the total 
by any means, is far below last 
years.
The new rushing plan took the 
former rush week from the mid
dle of the first semester and con
densed it down to four days at 
the beginning of the school year. 
Opinion is divided as to whether 
this new setup is better. Many of 
the fraternities went k> for ex
tensive summer rushing, contact
ing the incoming freshmen at their 
homes all during the vacation 
season. In spite of this the Greeks 
crowded more rushing into four 
days than they thought possible.
Tech To De-Emphasize 
Future Football Teams
Tuesday, January 26, 1937With the athletic world eagerly await
ing news of the new football coaching set-up at Carnegie Tech, Dr. 
Robert E. Doherty, president of theinstitution, on Friday announced 
simultaneously an entirely new athletic policy and the names of the 
men who will take charge of the^-----?mrtrr-----f-----'r-------------------
technical direction of the schools 
gridiron activities.
Plainly indicating that he has 
no desire to be a missionary or a 
reformer, Dr. Doherty stated that 
Carnegie Tech cannot afford bigtime football in the general mean
ing of the phrase. At the same 
time he expressed his approval 
of intercollegiate athletics as a 
definite part of the institutions 
program and reiterated the be
lief that there is a distinct place 
for the type of football and the 
type of teams that Carnegie will 
henceforth produce.
William F. Kern, former star 
tackle at the University of Pitts
burgh and for years assistant to 
Dr. J. B. Sutherland, was named 
head coach with Dr. Edward Bak-er being appointed backfield 
coach.
The Presidents statement fol
lows in part:
. . . The high entrance re
quirements, severe class sched
ules, and rigid scholastic standards 
insisted upon by the institution 
have made the task of maintain
ing a big-time team next to im
possible. The purpose is not to 
drop football. The reorganization 
will become effective July 1, 1937. 
There will be a transition period 
of three years during which the 
changes from present operations 
to those on a new basis will take 
place .. . Even if we are criticized 
at this time, I yet hope that five 
years from now our policy will be 
justified
Scotch And Soda
March 4, 1947Of course I have 
heard of Scotch and Soda, and 
Im glad that its active again, 
said Fred Waring as he was in
terviewed backstage after his suc
cessful concert in the Syria 
Mosque.
Early Plans Make 
Progress At Tech
April 10, 1907It was late in the year 1900 that Mr. Carnegie 
made the definite offer to the city of Pittsburgh of the money with 
which to establish a technical school for both sexes, on condition 
that the city would provide a suitable site. More than two years were 
then spent in the selection and^---------------------------------------------
purchase of the grounds for the 
school. In September 1903 the 
present site of thirty-two acres of 
land was purchased by the city 
and turned over to the trustees of 
the school.
In the meantime a committee
Andrew Carnegie
Founder Technical Schools
had outlined a plan lor the pro
posed school. Mr. Carnegie ap
proved the plan and placed at 
the disposal of the trustees of 
Carnegie Institute a sufficient 
fund with which to erect the nec
essary buildings. The buildings 
and equipment so far represent 
an expenditure of approximately 
$1,500,000. In addition to that, Mr. 
Carnegie has set. aside $4,000,000 
in United States Steel bonds to 
constitute a permanent endow
ment for the institution.
Quadrangle Planned 
As soon as possible after the 
selection of the site for the 
school, architects were invited to 
submit plans and those offered by 
Palmer and Mombostel of New 
York were accepted. The scheme 
provided for the housing of the 
four separate schools in as many 
distinct but connected buildings. 
The buildings when completed

entire series of buildings.
Ground was broken in April, 
1905 and in October of the same 
year the first class in the day 
school of Applied Science began.
The schools are divided into 
four distinct departments, knowTn 
respectively as the School of Ap
plied Science, the School of Ap
plied Design, the School of Ap
prentices and Journeymen and 
The Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women. The first three 
are for men, the last for women. 
All schools have both day and 
night classes.
The establishment of the new 
school was abundantly justified 
by the embarrassing number of 
applications for admission to its 
first year classes. The limited 
quarters then available made it 
necessary to restrict the numbr 
of students to 759.
No Co-education
To understand the work being 
carried on at the Carnegie Tech
nical Schools it must be borne in 
mind that each of the four 
schools, is virtually independent; 
each has aims and methods of its 
own, depending partly upon the 
character of the students which it 
aims to draw and partly upon the 
goal which it is striving to reach.
Even between the day courses and 
the night courses in the same 
school there are differences in 
age, in practical experience, and 
in time available for study on 
the part of the students. To each 
School, and in every part of each 
school, the attempt is made to 
select the subjects and the 
methods which will lead most di
rectly to the desired goal.
The Margaret Morrison Car
negie. School for Women aims to 
do for young women just what 
the mens schools are doing for the 
men. It should be borne in mind, 
however, that while the two 
schools are included in the same 
foundation there is in no sense 
co-education in the school. When 
the building now under construc
tion for the womens school is 
completed there will be almost no 
personal contact between the 
young men and the young wo
men.
Already various organizations 
which include athletic teams, de
bating societies, an annual year 
book, a weekly newspoaper, fra
ternities, engineering societies, 
and trading clubs have sprung up, 
an evidence of the character of 
the students which the school is 
attracting.
Elections
October 29, 1946  Maggie
Murph Frosh engage in a bloody 
election campaign. Candidates are 
running madly for the offices of 
president, secretary treasurer, 
Senate representative, and Wo
men's Guild representative. For 
two weeks prospective officers 
have been collecting autographs 
on petition slips, pasting slogans,
and Uke Squirt, generi

Editorials
Our First
October 24, 1906It is fitting and proper 
at this time when we send forth the first issue 
of the Tartan, that the students be informed 
of our purpose and the things we, the editors, 
stand for. As, in any venture of this kind, the 
success or failure depends upon the attitude 
and spirit in which it is received by those 
whom it reaches. The editors do not stand 
in the position of suppliants; they take the 
stand, rather, of those who are ready to de
liver the goods. It is the intention of the 
editors to place before the student body not 
only those events which have happened but 
newsy items of events to come. We have the 
patronage of our faculty, and hope to draw 
upon them for an occasional essay, which we 
have no hesitation in saying will be interest
ing. Outside talent will also be secured, and 
the Tartan will prove its right to the title 
of Official Organ of Carnegie Technical 
Schools.
Through The Years
April 10, 1957At the head of the list 
stands American football, which draws 
to the great contests larger than any other 
sports and which has been endorsed by our 
strenuous President as a developer of judg
ment and other good qualities which go to 
make up good citizens.
May 22, 1907We find that fraternity men 
are holding about fifty-five percent of the 
positions of responsibility. This is probably 
to be largely explained by the natural de
sire of fraternities to count the school lead
ers among their members. It becomes the 
duty of those fraternity men who are in of
fice to conduct the affairs of their organiza
tion so actively and wisely that no one will 
doubt that they obtained these offices be
cause of their special qualifications for them 
and not because of membership in a frater
nity.
January 19, 1916There has long been 
felt a need for a CIT song book such as those 
found in colleges.
February 18, 1927The new architectural 
book to be published aims to interest and 
aid the student more in his endeavor for 
attainments in his profession.
January 18, 1927The assemblies are 
poorly attended, especially by upperclass
men, many of whom acknowledge that they 
havent attended any this year, dismissing 
the whole question with a Well they dont 
do anything down there when we do go.
February 8, 1927We have fallen into a 
rut of passive acceptance of our status quo 
. . . things must be taught which will be 
serviceable.
October 3, 1936The solution to any ex
istent campus problem lies not in the fact 
that we have a bad system of government, 
but that we have permitted the abuse of a 
good system. A correction of the abuse can 
only come about by the student body demon
strating a tangible interest.
March 19, 1940In public colleges stu
dents feel more free to criticize the curricu
lum and the faculty. Students in endowed 
colleges are often forced to stomach incom
petent instructors or poorly organized cours
es. If there could be some means of allow
ing students to express opinions about facul
ty and curriculum and allowing students to 
help in shaping better, more progressive 
programs, the effect would be beneficial to 
both students and the private college.
January 16, 1945Traditions play an im
portant part in differentiating between a 
high school and a real college.
Dr. Doherty
March 19, 1947In discussing the very pertinent 
problem of student morale, with your reporters 
last week, Dr. Doherty, president of CIT, declared 
that he was eager to hear the students viewpoint 
and to do all he can to help on any and all such 
problems.
Assuming that the Administration is actively in
terested in promoting forward-looking school spirit 
and high level of student morale, we have inter
viewed the man who after five years as Dean of 
the School of Engineering at Yale, came to Tech 
in 1936.
The only error in our assumption was that we 
underestimated the extent to which that interest 
extends. What suggestions do you have for im
proving student understanding of my interest in 
them? was a question put to us several times 
during the interview.
Problems Discussed Monthly
To our surprise we discovered that there exists 
a Student Conference committee which meets with 
Dr. Doherty at least once a month to diseuss vari
ous problems confronting the students. The com
mittee, composed of campus leaders, is charged 
with the task of relaying to their fellow students 
information and policies brought up at these meet
ings.
At least as important in the eyes of Dr. Doherty 
is the opportunity that the members of this com
mittee have to present their problems and the ideas 
to the President. Though not specifically elected 
by the student body for that purpose, the com
mittee has the responsibility of representing their 
classmates at these meetings.
Speaks With Experience
Speaking as one who cnce had the job of plac
ing graduate engineers (for twenty-one years with 
Generaf Electric) Dr. Doherty advised students to 
get into extracurricular activities if at all possible. 
He said that there were two schools of thought on 
the subject: 1) a fellow who is a good mixer but 
not necessarily at the top scholastically will be the 
most successful in life, and 2) the man who achieves 
top scholastic standing will do the best.
He further explained, From studies that have 
been made and from my experience, I would ex
pect the best scholars to reach the top in any tech
nical field. It may be different in other, non-technical fields, I really dont know. It quite often 
happens that a good, all-around fellow will be good 
in everything else as well as in his studies. There 
doesnt seem to be any unfailing rule about it; 
some of the most successful men from my own 
class at the University of Illinois were very re
tiring.
Dr. Doherty concluded by stating his pleasure 
at the great interest shown in recent school dances 
and the great activity shown in the preparation 
for Spring Carnival and Scotch and Soda.
Why Not Now
October 12, 1911Why could we not have cheer
ing practice upon certain days of the week at 4 and 
again at 5 p.m., lasting from 10 to 15 minutes? Many 
students spend this length of time each evening 
watching the teams practice. Cheering practice 
would bring forth a few more. It would in no way 
interfere with the men watching the squads at work 
and would certainly add color to a scrimmage. And 
finally, though but a small percentage of the student 
body would get this training, still a nucleus would 
be formed which would work wonders at the 
games.
Huge Crowd At Pep Rally
November 8, 1938Certainly the greatest foot
ball pep rally in the history of the school was held 
Friday evening in the famed Tech Bowl before a 
roaring crowd of 3,000 persons. Cheer after cheer 
echoed through the Bowl and reverberated in 
thousands of radios throughout the city. A torch 
parade climaxed the stupendous display of burning 
school spirit in anticipation of the game with Pitt.
Oct. 1913Large attendance at football game in 
spite of rainy weather.
Sept. 28, 1926Football dances to be held after 
every home game.

Blind Dates Are No Longer 
Necessary Evil: Bureau In
Tuesday, Nov. 24, 1936.
You heard me the first timeblind dates are no longer 
necessary evil. Yes, boys and girls what used to be and still is a 
very risky business is no longer necessary. When a couple of en
gineers thought theyd like to date a couple of girls from arts school 
and asked these two freshman dramats to fix things up, the Tartan 
Date Bureau began. It was conducted by those two freshman dramats, 
Buzz Fineblatt and Clay Yurdin with headquarters on the third floor 
back of McGill Hall.
Heres how the bureau operates Sherley, the feminine V.P., 
and the boys have on file all the campus eligibles who have regis
tered. Just call Buzz or Clay at McGill between 7:15 and 7:45. AJ 
dates guaranteed, and youre invited to ask the man whose dated one.
What the Date Bureau does is let you pick a surprise package 
after telling whats in all the packageseveryone will admit that 
this is a very, very good thing.
One of the probable developments coming out of the establish
ment of the bureau will be a greater dating frequency among en
gineers now that the risk factor in blind dating has been eliminated.

In Techs Possession
March 31, 1936For the first time in the history of the Eastern 
Intercollegiate conference, gold basketballs, symbolic of the cham
pionship, will be awarded to the members of the Carnegie team. 
The officials of the league have decided to make ten awards to the
Championship team, and the Car-^--------------------------------------------------

four more to give one to every 
member of the squad who won a 
letter.
Eleven players: Macalka, Shomo, Gibson, Patt, Greenberg, Mil
ler, Misceviks, Fitzwilson, Felser, 
Jagnow and James earned letters 
for play during the season. Betrause of the successful year the 
council has decided to award let
ters to Kritscher and Slaminko so 
-that every member of the squad 
will wear the varsity C.
During the season the Tartans 
annexed 15 wins, including the 
post-season game with Pitt, and 
lost eight. In the opener the lads 
showed signs of what might follow by knocking over the strong 
Westminster five. During the 
Christmas holidays the club 
dropped games to West Virginia 
and Waynesburg and won from 
Case. Soon after school opened the 
Skibos went over to the Stadiupi 
court and, paced by the diminu
tive Buzzy Greenberg, toppled 
Pitt for the first time in six years. 
Duquesne showed too much for 
I .ie Tartans and won from them 
twice.
Team Outscored
In the league Carnegie split two 
games with West Virginia and 
Temple, won two from Penn State 
and Georgetown. The Scots won 
one from Pitt and lost one during 
the regular season and downed 
Pitt in the championship game 
after the season had been official
ly closed, foAlthough Carnegie won 15 of 
the 23 games played, the lads scor
ed less points than their oppon
ents. The total for the opponents 
was 760, for Carnegie 756. This is 
explained by the fact that there 
were so many narrow margined 
wins. Eight of the victories were 
by five points or less.
The high scorer for the year was 
Si Felser, who dropped in more 
ecfian a hundred points. . Charlie 
Fitzwilson was next with slightly 
under a hundred points, and co
captain Gibson was in there when 
the TPs were counted. He rolled 
in more than 80 points.
Court Star 
Cratsley Sets 
Two Records
1938Frank Melvin Cratsley 
a new Eastern Intercollegiate 
Conference basketball champion. 
With a new record of thirty-four 
points scored in a single game, 
Mel goes down in the Tartan an
nals as one of the finest, best 
liked, and - most able basketball 
-layers ever to frequent the cor
ridors of the Institute.
A product of Imperial, Mel 
came to Tech with the prime ob
jective of playing football and 
getting a good education. Basket
ball was a side-line then, but now 
it is one of his chief loves. With 
the recent annexation of not only 
one, but rather two conference 
titles, the towering lad makes 
fair bid for next years basketball 
i^ptaincy. And he well deserves 
it.
The dual record set by Mel 
Cratsley last Saturday night, in 
case the nimble reader was at 
home having an all-night session 
with the beloved slide rule, runs 
something like this: The number 
of points scored in one ganje rec
ord was broken with 34. The sec
ond record was that concerned 
with the number of charity tosses 
meeting in one game. Mell toss
ed in an even ten free ones.
Women Riflers 
Take First Place; 
Set New Record
Tuesday, May 4, 1937  Ser
geant Sommers women riflers 
have captured the national title 
again this year by shooting the 
exceptionally fine score of 2994, 
a new national record. The official 
results, just released last week, 
indicate that the Tartan team has 
captured first place by breaking 
the ten-year existing national re
cord of 2991.
By taking the national cham
pionship again the Tartan sharp
shooters are continuing the fine 
record of Coach Sommers teams 
of the past three years. Three 
years ago, the first year that the 
Sergeant took over the women 
shooters, the team captured sec
ond place in the national compeTech Conquers 
Notre Dame 9-7 
After Hard Battle
1937The Kilties are Coming, 
hurray, hurray!
The Kilties are coming, theyll 
win today.
For theyre fighting for the 
glory of Carnegie!
And win they did. From across 
Panther Hollow a gallant band of 
Skibos streamed into the Stadium 
last Saturday and upset a heavily 
favored Notre Dame eleven, 9-7.
The Tartans won the hard way, 
coming from behind to push over 
a third-quarter field goal, and 
then clinging desperately to a twopoint lead as the Irish played the 
entire last period on the Plaid 
goal line.
It looked easy for the visitors 
as they launched a fifty-five-yard 
drive the first time they got their 
hands on the ball, but a fighting 
and fast charging Tartan forward 
wall rose up, as it did all after
noon, to stop the Irish onslaught 
when it almost hit pay dirt. In 
the final analysis it was the 
charging of this Skibo front that 
spelled the difference in the final 
score; time and again they dug 
in within the shadows of their 
own goal posts and turned back 
the drive of the Irish.
Tartans Score First
To open the second quarter the 
Tartans completed a 58-yard pass 
to the Irish 2-yard line. On the 
next scrimmage Leo Napotnik 
hurtled across for the first score of 
the contest. The try for the extra 
point bounced off the goal posts 
leaving the Tartans with a 6-0 
lead to protect. Twice in the next 
ten minutes the Tartan defense
tition and first place in the indivi
dual competition.
In the succeeding two years 
the girls have captured the na
tional team title with ease. Such 
an excellent record as compiled 
during these past four years is 
certainly a tribute to the coaching 
of Sergeant Sommer and the fine 
work of the women.
Carnegie Becomes 
Conference Champ 
By Beating Pitt
March 17, 1936Carnegie won 
the Eastern Intercollegiate con
ference basketball last night in the 
Pitt stadium by defeating the Pitt 
Panthers 32-27. The Tartans play 
was featured by a steady first half 
come-back which pulled them 
from ten points behind to within 
one point at the half.
Rowe opened the scoring when 
he dropped in a bucket in the 
opening moments of the game. 
Felser countered for the Plaid 
with a free throw. Then Pitt pull
ed ahead with baskets by Loucks, 
Jesko and Rowe, while Carnegie 
was satisfied with two fouls. With 
ten minutes to go in the first half, 
Pitt led 11-5.
Jagnow went in for Macalka. 
Pitt dumped in more points until 
the score was 17-10 with five min
utes to play. The Tartans started 
to click and Jagnow, Patt and 
James hit the hoop. Just before 
the gun at the half, Patt hooked 
one in to knot the score. With the 
play speeding up Miller fouled 
Roderick, who dropped the leather 
through the net to put Pitt in the 
lead, 20-19 at half time.
The Plaid players were on in 
the second half and baskets by 
Patt and Miller netted the lads a 
lead which the Panthers couldnt 
surmount.
Jagnow and Felser led the scor
ing for Carnegie with nine points 
each.

within their 5-yard line. The 
Irish were not to be denied, how
ever, and a short time later they

soak-provoking tournament were 
approved at last weeks general 
Carnival committee meeting.
Each team will consist of two 
men, a spearsman and a paddler. 
The spearman must stand erect 
in the canoe at a point from four 
to seven feet behind the bow. His 
weapon will be a long pole, well 
padded on the end, to be used to 
dismount his opponent. A team is 
victor if both members remain 
afloat with the spearsman in his 
standing position when (1) either 
member of the opposing team has 
gone overboard, or (2) three fouls 
have been declared against the 
opposing team, or (3) if the op
ponents canoe is swamped.
No organization may enter 
more than two teams. The tilting 
champs will be determined by 
eliminations, two heats taking 
place simultaneously. Canoes and 
spears will be furnished by the 
committee and life guards will be 
on duty during the fray to see 
that CIT does not lose any poten

a long, cold ride, the varsity went 
down to defeat at the hands of 
Allegheny last Friday night, Feb
ruary 20, by a score of 70 to 12 
The players showed the effects of 
the game of the night before and 
also of the journey from Pitts
burgh to Meadville, for they put 
j up a listless resistance to the 
! fierce attack of the home team. 
The Plaid players lacked every
thing that they had had on Thurs
day night (when they beat Grove 
City, 48-19) and suffered at the 
hands of a good team.
Not a field goal was scored in 
the first half, and Criswell and 
Douthett were the only ones to 
score from the field in the second 
period. The game, if one-sided 
was clean and fast, only fourteen 
fouls being called in the entire 
time. Park was the heavy scorei, 
getting ten field goals.

We were not in the least surprised to hear of your magnificent vic
tory over Pittsburgh. Congratulations! Our own varsity reported that 
you were by far the cleanest and hardest hitting team they have met 
in several years. Certainly a team such as yours deserves the distinc
tion you have gained this Saturday. Holy Cross, in the words of Cap
tain Bill Osmanski, in losing to Carnegie Tech, lost to a better team. 
We can now point with pride to the fact that the only team that 
could beat us was good enough to be the conquerors of ,the nation
ally vaunted Panthers. Once again, congratulations to the only team 
in the country we consider better than our own. Yours in clean sports,

March 16, 1937 (Editorial)
What is the cause of the apparent 
lack of school spirit on Carnegie 
Campus? This lack of spirit has 
been attributed to everything from 
the difficult schedule carried by 
the students to the location of the 
school. Several factors enter into 
the reason for this deficiency in 
such an important element in the 
life of Carnegie, but there is one 
need that stands head and shoul
ders above all the others; Carnegie 
is sadly in need of a student ac
tivities building.
M.M.C.S.
. March 22, 1916  The first 
classes were held in the Industry 
Building. At this time one of the 
main duties of the administration 
seems to have been to separate 
the girls and boys studying in the 
same building. Separate doors and 
paths were used. Statistics con
cerning the marriages of the 
alumni of M.M.C.S. would lend 
one to believe that the admini
stration seems to have failed in 
its undertaking.
The contract for the construc
tion of the M.M.C.S. was let July 
2, 1906.
Former Tartan 
Editors Succeed 
After Graduation
Fred E. Foster1906
The Carnegie Tartan was first 
organized in 1906 by Fred E. Fos
ter who became the papers first 
editor-in-chief. Before his gradu
ation from the department of 
metallurgical engineering in 1908, 
Mr. Foster had been president of 
his class, captain of Techs first 
football team, and associate edi
tor of the first Thistle.
After graduation he was em
ployed in the construction of the 
Panama Canal. While in the serv
ice during World War I he was 
wounded and later personally dec
orated with the Order of the Pur
ple Heart by General John Persh
ing. At this time he was elevated 
to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
At the time of his death in 
1944, Mr. Foster was managing 
director of California Oil and Gas 
Association. He was a well-known 
figure in the oil industry, particu
larly on the west coast where he 
resided for more than 25 years.
Harold Heilman1916
Harold Heilman, an architect of 
the class of 1917, was editor dur
ing the 10th year anniversary of 
the Tartan. Nicknamed Doc, he 
was described as the fellow who 
has done so much for Tech and 
one that every student will miss 
when he has to leave us. His 
strong character and progressive 
ways have won for him a great 
number of admirers, as well as a 
heap of friends not only in school
? May 10, 1940  Generally the 
only thing campus revues really 
have to recommend them is the 
fact that several of the schools 
brawniest males put on a shocking 
amount of stage make-up, yellow 
wigs, and what they fondly think 
js a falsetto voice, and cavort 
through the show as a cutie chor
us and romantic feminine leads.
Now you take Tech (as a great 
many of you have, for better or 
for worse) and take it with no 
strings and take it straight and 
"vhoa! What we meant to say was, 
here at Tech, a campus revue is a 
different matter entirely. What 
with music students writing and 
playing the music, and costume 
ecs designing and making the cos
tumes and P and Ds designing 
the sets and physics majors and 
electrical engineers and a dramat 
or two on lights and a few stray 
engineers and printers hammer
ing away at the sets, not to men
tion the dramats, who do the act
ing, youve got what differs from 
a professional show only in that 
it is as gay and happily disre
spectful of dull institutions as 
only college students can afford 
to be.
Current Reviews
Which brings us to One on the 
House, Scotch and Sodas revuefl 
currently playing down at the 
Music Hall. Students with carni
val tickets will see it tomorrow 
night. Those who remember the 
two previous Scotch and Soda 
shows will find that this produc
tion is much more interestingly 
and conveniently arranged. In
stead of the four or five acts of 
the previous shows, there are two 
acts, each with lots of short num
bers. And the numbers are either " 
musical song and dance numbers 
or they are skits. There is no 
awkward combination of both, 
with singer leaving the situation 
and coming down front to sing a 
song not too much connected with 
the at hand. We find that the 
show moves faster this way, and 
that it has a lot morewell 
umph.
but everywhere. Get Busy is'7' 
his motto, and well he practices 
what he preaches.

Editors note: the material used in this article was collected by 
one of our intrepid reporters, who risked life and limb to bring 
the TARTAN readers a true picture of the institution on the other
side of Forbes Street. ?---------------------------------------------------------
October 6, 1953  I had hardly 
finished registration at Carnegie 
for the 1953-54 school term when 
the fates swept me into one of the 
most harrowing adventures I have 
experienced since my first brush
with the chain-smoking, coffeedrinking crowds of Skibo. 
Scarcely a day of class had pass
ed when two swarthy individuals 
approached me near the entrance 
to Administration Hal!.
They asked my name and 
pointed to a sleek black Daimler 
which waited at the curb. We en
tered the windowless passenger 
compartment and drove off. When 
I next saw the light of day, we 
stood before the impressive office 
building that houses the editorial 
offices of the Carnegie Tartan. My 
companions motioned for me to 
enter.
We proceeded to the lavish 
apartment of the editor, who sat 
at his teakwood desk awaiting our 
arrival. He was a corpulent, pur
ple-lipped individual with a green 
stained glass eyeshade. The room 
in which he sat was papered in 
gold leaf, and carpeted in hand 
wroven green. An artistically tatooed lampshade of human skin 
decorated tfie editorial desk, and 
over it hung a sign reading To
day Carnegie Tech, Tomorrow the 
World.  *5 ** 
The editor greeted me. and ex
plained his plan| I "\vas to spend 
a period of time as an observer in 
a place about a half mile from 
here which he referred to only as 
Pit. It was agreed that' I should 
go well prepared, and that in case 
of detection I would bite a small 
capsule of poison concealed in my 
mouth. This would prevent the 
ruthless operatives at Pit from 
extorting any highly classified in
formation from me.
For ten days I underwent an 
extensive training course design
ed to provide me with the proper 
equipment for my assignment. I 
learned not to ask persons with 
whom I conversed what evidence 
they had for their statements, and 
not to genuflect when I heard the 
word Plan. By the end of the 
period, I was prepared complete
ly, and entered the Daimler again 
to travel to our destination.
I said goodbye to my compan
ions at the corner of Craig and 
Fifth, and walked toward the 
bleak gray structure that was to 
be my home for an undetermined 
length of time. It seemed to have 
a sort of rustic charm about it. I 
entered and found myself in a 
place I had learned to call the 
Commons Room. It was a high, 
vaulted place, in a somewhat 
earlier Gothic style than Skibo.
I then proceeded to the third 
floor and my first class, fearing 
all the time that the instructor 
would notice the strange (that is 
to say, unfamiliar) face in his
classroom and become suspicious. 
My credentials were not fully in 
order for reasons which cannot be 
described here, so I was some
what worried about my first 
meeting with a member of the 
faculty.
I could not help but feel that 
something was amiss. Everyone 
seemed far too normal and com
petent, much more human than 
I had expected. Were they on to 
our scheme? Were they cunningly 
showing me only the best side of 
the place? I could not help won
der about these things.
Though it was all in all a har
rowing experience, the aboriginies 
on the other side of Forbes Street 
are far more highly civilized than 
we had suspected. Some are in 
fact quite personable. The experi
ence awakened in me a sort of 
wanderlust, and a desire to see 
other strange places. Perhaps next 
year we can visit and report on 
Tibet.
April 1, 1939It has just been 
announced that the sale of hard 
drinks will be conducted by mem
bers of the faculty this year. Ex
cellent bar tenders have been dis
covered among the administration 
members. Professor C. C. Leeds 
of the management engineering 
department has had years of ex
perience in the mixing of hard 
drinks and features a vodka drink 
that will bounce eight times. All 
in all, this years Carnival should 
be successful as far as refresh
ment is concerned.
Orchestras? Why not? Already 
David Morrison, chairman, has 
signed Benny Goodman and Kay 
Kyser for the afternoon tea 
dances. For the evening dances 
Larry Clinton, Art Shaw, Paul 
Whiteman, and Russ Morgan will 
preside.
It was rumored for several years 
that the administration was con
templating expanding the Car
nival period, and news has reach
ed the Tartans ears that Carnival 
will begin Tuesday night, May 7, 
and will continue to May 13.
Members of the Carnival com
mittee wish to announce that Call 
Day will assume an entirely dif
ferent aspect this year. Instead of 
calling new members of honoraries, a new slant is being taken. A 
hog calling contest will be con
ducted by Bob Burns and his ba
zooka. Prizes will be three hun
dred pound razorbacks.
Dorm rules for girls have been 
done away with for the duration 
of the Carnival period. Girls will 
be permitted to stay out all night 
with no questions asked. For de
tails see Dean Green.
"What Happened?"
Intercollegiate raiding reached the ultimate in daring when 
Tech students stormed the Pitt Cathedral and carried off the portion 
shown to transplant it on our beautiful campus. Howrever, the struc
ture was summarily removed as an eyesore.
Eureka! Exclaims 
Dazed Freshman 
A iter Buying Books
Tuesday, October 15, 1946
Are you standing in line for 
Skibo or the Bookstore?
I dont know! Ive been here 
only a half an hour and the people 
in front of me claim we wont 
know until we either smell the 
coffee or are jabbed in the back 
by a T-square.
These alarming conditions are 
just a sample of what has exist
ed at Carnegie Tech during the 
past week. Unsuspecting instruc
tors blithely read to each class a 
list of supplies to be picked up at 
the bookstore. All Carnegies 
eager beavers hurriedly cashed 
checks to cover the amount for 
books. Freshmen, innocently ask
ing their way, were told that the
I bookstore was located beside the 
! post office in the basement of 
! Administration Hall.
But could they get near the 
bookstore? No, of course! Hornes 
nylon line had nothing on CITs 
j book line. Instead of making coke 
[ dates, progressive fraternity men 
said, See you in the book line at 
2:45. Ambitious coeds carefully 
combed their hair and straighten
ed their dinks to be sure of im
pressing the tall blonde fellow 
they knew would be getting an 
English book.
GIs returning from months of 
standing in chow lines confessed 
that they thought that maybe the 
school was putting on a welcome 
program to make them feel at 
home.
Now we all have our books, and 
are hard at work on advanced as
signments. And do you know, Ill 
bet there isnt any line at ail at 
the bookstore today!

Girl Soliciting In Cafeteria 
?Finds Tech Male Responsive
By CARL ARENDT
May I ask a personal questions? she breathed, sidling up to 
me as I stood in the Skibo lunch line. I gulped for air, and as I 
blushed I could feel my tartan knee socks sliding down my shins.
This was tha girl I had long admired from afar as she cleaned
her glassware in the lab. Often I#-------------------------------------------------------
had wanted to inspect her beakers
more closely. And now here she 
was, lovely and desirable, stand%ing before me, her magnificent 
lips parted in a half-smile. I could 
not speak, but I made an amusing 
little gesture to show her that I 
was paying attention.
She pouted her magnificent lips 
a little and repeated, I said, may 
I ask you a personal question?
I blushed again but finally man
aged to stammer, Sh-shoot.
She blinked her magnificent 
^ eyes, wriggled happily for a little 
while, and then asked, Are you 
apathetic?
Every red corpuscle in my body 
shrieked a protest. How could I, 
with the girl of my dreams stand
ing magnificently before me, say 
anything but NO! frightening 
the girl behi/id the counter. Then 
I repeated, No, firmly, but more 
quietly, Im not apathetic and 
grabbed her.
^ Deftly slipping from my grasp, 
she smiled, showing her magnifi
cent teeth, and said, Then youll 
be glad to contribute to the Cam
pus Chest, wont you?
Modestly lowering my eyes, I 
responded, Of course, and, since 
I had my wallet out to pay the 
cashier, I gave her my contribu
tion on the spot.
Warning: this may happen to 
 you. SOMEONE YOU KNOW will 
 ask. you to contribute to the Cam
pus Chest. Give generously.
50 Years
[continued from page 2] 
Today, while we have interna
tional pressures, we have no war 
or depression to worry us. The 
nature of the school has so changed in fifty years, that the type of 
news covered today is hardly com
parable to that of the first issues. 
The" editors try to maintain a 
balance of news which is of in
terest and importance to the cam
pus.
The editorial structure has varried over the years, also, with 
every type of editor imaginable 
included in the mast head at one 
time or another.
Unique Organization 
This years organization, devel
oped because of the unique situa
tion last year of having no seniors 
and four juniors on the editorial 
staff, has turned out to be highly 
successful. Last year Bob Russell 
served as editor, with Marjo King, 
Stephanie Mackay, and Dick Fox 
acting as news, features, and copy 
editors.
0) Two years in a row as editorin-chief is difficult for any col
lege student, and Bob reorgan
ized the editorial staff into an 
editorial board, with Stephie Mac
kay as managing editor, Marjo 
King associate editor in charge of 
news policies, and Dick Fox as
sociate editor in charge of pro
duction (layout, etc.). Bob, as ex
ecutive editor serves an advisory 
capacity to the board and works 
$ closely with Stephanie in getting 
the paper out each weekend.
Under the Board are Ann For
est, news editor, Ed Rogers, copy 
edtior, and Bob Hoppe, sports edi
tor. Business manager Bob Sorkin 
and secretary Joan Seidel help to 
keep the office running smoothly. 
It has been found that the larger 
number of editors working closely 
with one another on matters of 
^ news content and policy ,is highly 
" effective in producing a paper 
that reflects the interests of a 
large part o the school.
YM & YWCA Set 
Retreat Program 
For This Weekeiul
A fall retreat November 2-4 at 
Camp Lutherlyn, near Butler, is 
planned by the student Christian 
movement of this district. An ex
cellent program has been planned.
Dr. L. B. Moseley, pastor of the 
First Baptist Church of Pitts
burgh will speak Friday evening 
and Saturday morning, relating 
the Christian gospel to world po
litical needs. Dr. Moseley, well 
known as a fiery and scholarly 
man, with a good sense of humor, 
is just back from a trip to Europe 
and the Middle East, where he in
terviewed, prominent Church lead
ers such as Martin Niemoller, in 
several countries.
Saturday evening and Sunday 
morning, the program will be in 
charge of Robert James, on the 
staff of the Middle Atlantic S.C.M. 
Bob is familiar to most student 
Christian leaders of this region as 
a friendand counselor.
The retreat will include the 
following groups and colleges:
YMCAs, YWCAs, Christian 
Associations and Fellowships, 
Westminster Foundations, Roger 
Williams Fellowships (and, un
officially, many other denomina
tional groups); Tech, Bethany, 
Chatham, Geneva, Washington 
and Jefferson, and Waynesburg 
Colleges, Indiana, California, and 
West Liberty State Teachers Col
leges, and the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Members of the Y may apply 
for conference scholarships to pay 
for part of their expenses. Miss 
Ruth Shinn, Co-ordinator of Re
ligious Activities, is handling the 
details for Tech.
University Service 
Helps Students 
Of Many Lands
In their struggle upward, stu
dents everywhere need a helping 
hand. Their road is hard,their 
needs are critical. With these 
words of Dr. Ralph in mind, the 
students of Tech set aside more 
than half of their donations to 
Campus Chest for the welfare of 
students less fortunate than them
selves. Part of these donations are 
sent to the World University Serv
ice, service organization for the 
world community of university 
students.
Although the status of univer
sity students in the United States 
is not in all respects satisfactory, 
the general standards are such 
that the American college student 
may fail to realize that his own 
fortunate standing among the 
students of the world.
For example, the ratio of Afri
can college students to population 
is one in thirty-six thousand; in 
America, the ratio is one in ten. 
In Germany, a survey revealed 
that two out of three student refu
gees interviewed live on less than 
a dollar a day. Between three and 
five thousand Japanese college 
students desperately need hospi
talization, which costs as much as 
the average Japanese family earns 
in a whole year.
Students Stand United 
World University Service aims 
to promote the well-being and 
successful education of the student 
population by uniting the univer
sity community in a common ef
fort against poverty, hunger, sick
ness, and despair at colleges 
throughout the world.
WUS recognizes many areas of 
student need; thus its program 
extends over a wide range of 
activities. It provides aid to stu
dents taking refuge in the U. S., 
Greece, France, and Germany, 'it 
has established scholarship and 
loan funds for worthy students in 
Greece, Africa, Egypt, India, Pak
istan, and Japan.

SnS President 
Designs Theater 
For Next Show
John Leonard, in addition to be
ing president of this years Scotch 
and Soda, is in the process of de
signing a new theater for this 
years show. The theater will 
again be in the round because of 
its popularity last year, says 
John. Im trying to design a the
ater that will hold more people.
A variety show will again be the 
theme for this years as last. In 
the capacity of president, John 
heads the executive board which 
functions during the year to de
termine Scotch and Soda policy.
This is the fourth year for John 
in the club. His freshman year he 
was backstage coordinator and 
draftsman; his sophomore and 
junior year he was technical di 
rector; and last year he designed 
the theater in the round.
Besides Scotch and Soda, John, 
a senior physicist, has numerous 
other activities on campus. He 
plays in the Kiltie Band (the 
Bagpipe Corps) and the Student 
Orchestra. He is a member of 
ODK, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa 
Phi, Phi Mu Epsilon, and Phi Mu 
Alpha.
John has had a great deal of ex
perience in theater work, in that 
he has worked for the last three 
summers in summer theaters. He 
worked at the Plymouth Rock 
Center of Music and Drama, which 
did work on operas. He has also 
worked at the Adelphia College 
Summer Theater, and was tech
nical director this summer at the 
Seacliff Summer Theater on the 
North Shore of Long Island.
Open Letter To Students
This Is The Week Of Giving
Hundreds of students in Delhi, India, last year were 
homeless. Recognizing the potential of university students 
in the Middle East in positions of diplomatic, technical, and 
academic leadership, World University Service stepped in 
with provisions for emergency housing for Indian students.
A Negro youth sought admission to a Northern univer
sity last year. Behind him was the National Scholarship 
Service and Fund for Negro Students recognizing the need 
for bringing promising American Negro youth into the North
ern collegiate community.
This fall a Tech foreign student returned to the cam
pus with the aid of a scholarship. He is continuing his study 
on our campus because the students of Tech recognized the 
need for scholarship aid for foreign students.
This year, then, students in Delhi have homes; a Negro 
boy is studying in a leading Eastern university; a foreign 
student has returned to our campusbecause last year the 
students of CIT gave, through Campus Chest.
Yesterday 325 Tech students began a week-long personto-person solicitation for the 1956 Campus Chest. Their 
goal: 100% participation; their philosophy; In giving to Cam
pus Chest we are answering human need . . . wre are ful
filling our responsibility to the community in which we live 
. . . we are learning to give intelligently and with purpose.
Today Tech students will Give . . . they will give blood 
for veterans in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Oak
land; they will give, through Campus Chest, welfare and 
self-help to struggling students, to needy families, to under
nourished children, to men and women afflicted with cancer, 
polio, and heart diseaseall over the world.
As you pass the Blood Mobile today and when your 
Campus Chest solicitor approaches you, Give proudly dur

P*6 3CARNEGIE TARTANTuesday, October St, tfS
Tartans Down Presidents
By Sherry Nelmark
An estimated crowd of 3500 
Tech and W & J students were on 
hand Saturday afternoon at Forbes 
Field to see the Carnegie Tech 
Tartans handily drop the Presi
dents of W & J by a score of 16-0. 
Tom Briner, as usual, played an 
outstanding game on both offense 
and defense. *
Techs other defensive stars of 
the day ware Earl Benner, Ken 
Ficery, Larry Cassett, little Jim 
Temmel and John Tucci. The Tar
tan attack was hampered to some 
extent by Tuccis injured right 
arm as Tech was forced to move 
almost entirely on the ground. 
Big surprise of the day was the 
fact that Tech made both extra 
points. Supplying the toe that 
Coach Baker has been looking for 
all season was Walt Majeski.
Tech Scores First
The game started off with a 
loud bang. Bob Hammers kick-off 
was high and deep into Jay terri
tory. A couple of plays later John 
Tucci recovered a loose ball on 
the W & J 37 yard line. Briner 
carried around right end for 20 
yards. Quatse went around left 
end for another 11 yards. Ma
jeski bulled through center for 
five and Quatse ploughed over 
from the one. Majeski kicked the 
point and Tech led 7 to 0.
Once more Hammer kicked off 
high and deep. The W & J team 
was pushed back to their goal and 
on the punt attempt the back 
fumbled and recovered the ball 
behind his own goal for a safety. 
With less than three minutes of 
the game played, Tech led 9-0.
Briner took the Jay kickoff on 
the 31 and returned to the 44. 
Quatse went around end for seven 
yards. Briner carried off-tackle for 
six yards. Jeep Myers slid around 
end for 11, but at this point the 
Tech attack bogged down and 
W&J took over on downs. After 
an exchange of punts W&J moved 
up to the 46 where they were held.
The punt was taken on the 
Tech 27 where Muth passed to 
McElhinney for 16 yards, but once 
more Tech was held and there
Tucci scores for Tech in the last quarter.
was an.exchange of punts. McEl
hinney smashed through center 
for 11 yards. He carried again for 
two yards, and once more for 
six yards. Muth gained one on a 
quarterback sneak, but Gaydos 
was stopped for no gain. Jay took 
over but immediately fumbled and 
Cassett recovered.
Briner ran for five yards, Ma
jeski gained six yards and then 
Tom Briner smashed off tackle for 
44 yards and a TD. However the 
play was called back for offensive 
holding. Several minutes later 
after another exchange of punts 
the clock ran out.
Second Half
The third quarter was very 
uneventful, both teams being un
able to gain. As the fourth quar
ter started Tech had the ball deep 
in its territory when Frank Zinni 
gained 12 yards and McElhinney 
gained three. On the next play 
Tech fumbled and Jay recovered.
It looks as if this was the break 
W&J was wraiting for, but the Tech 
line proved superior as the W&J 
team was pushed back to the 40. 
Tech took over and McElhinney 
ran for two, and Zinni slanted 
once more off-tackle for 17 yards. 
At this point Tech was penalized 
for holding and Tucci was forced 
to punt. W&J took over on the 
nine but were immediately penal
ized to the one. The Jay punt was 
partially blocked and Tech took 
over on the five.
Zinni gained three, then one,
and one more carried for no gain. 
Tucci went over for the score. 
Once more Majeski converted. 
Hammer kicked off but the Presi
dents were held. Muth passed to 
Myers for 50 yards, as the game 
ended with the ball on the W&J 
four-yard line.
Diplomats Go This 
Week, Tech Will 
Play At Lancaster
This Saturday the Tartans will 
try to lengthen their winning 
streak when they journey to Lan
caster to meet the Franklin and 
Marshall Diplomats in the sixth 
gridiron tilt between the two
schools.
This weeks game will see the 
return of Bob Schmitz, ace Tar
tan fullback, to the lineup. Bob, 
who suffered a cracked rib in the 
Johns Hopkins game has been 
sidelined for a number of weeks.
Center Ed Auslnder has a
broken hand and is out indefinite
ly. Luckily, the Tech squad
emerged from the W&J game un
scathed.
The series began in 1909 with 
Tech winning 11-5. Tech holds 
the series lead: three wins, one 
loss, and one tie. Last year Tech 
won 12-0.
Olds, Bryant, and Ottervik 
Combine To Top Westminster
This Friday afternoon Arnie Olds and Larry Bryant will finish 
brilliant stays for the Plaid when they run for the last time in the 
annual tri-state championships. While these lads have been at Car
negie, the* Tartans have not know a losing cross-country season. Both 
Larry and Arnie have been con-4---------------------------------------------------------

time for all three. Previously, 
throughout the season, Ottervik 
and Bryant had taken turns wait
ing for each other, but against 
Westminster, it was Olds turn.
Tech breezed to a 20-37 victory 
against Wes|minster after being 
humbled by. the Rockets of Slip
pery Rock. lAt the offset, Bryant 
set a mean pace with Ottervik 
and Olds close behind trying to 
fight off Ace Jackson of West.minster, a fine quarter miler from
Youngstown, Ohio. But at the 
half way point it was Olds out 
front with Bryant and Ottervik 
some 50 yards behind and all 
alone. Interesting to note is that 
it took a full minute and fifteen 
seconds before any other runners 
finished, but after the fourth man 
crossed the line, six more fol
lowed in less than 45 seconds.
Fine Season for Plaid 
. Showing well for Carnegie were 
Phil Hubbard, a freshman, Fero 
Fritz, also a freshman, and Len 
Elihan, a sophomore. Tech is again 
assured of a winning season as 
they have only one meet left and 
have a five-two record. If Bryant, 
Ottervik and Olds maintain their 
usual fine form and the thrill of 
tri-state can inspire our inexperi
enced freshmen, there is no reacon why the Tartans will not be 
crowned champions at Tri-State,
Ottervick and Bryant win in Westminster meet.

All Leagues Tighten; 
DTD, KS, PK Hold Lead
By George Paris
As IM football season nears its end, a few teams in each league 
are battling down to the wire.
Last week in the Kiltie League action the Kappa Sigs conquered 
the PiKAs 18-4 to remain undefeated. Meanwhile SAE slaughtered
the DU Bs 40-6 and ATO over-4---------------------------------------------------
ran the Obelisks 3b-5. The Kappa
Sigs lead the league while SAE 
and ATO are in second place, each 
having lost once. ATO and Kappa 
Sig clash on Wednesday for one 
of the weeks big games, which 
ATO must win to stay in conten
tion.
Elsewhere, in Skibo League play, 
the Delts outlasted the Trojans 
22-12 in a close contest. The Delts 
speed proved to be decisive in 
winning the contest. Although the 
Delts appear to have the crown 
sewed up, the Met Grads and TXs 
continued to win and remain on 
their heels.
The Phi Kaps downed the Static 
Charges 38-2 to remain the un
defeated Tartan League leaders. 
Sigma Nu, with one loss downed 
the Met Grads 11-6 and Beta Sigs, 
also with one defeat, overran ATO 
B 23-8. Sterling play by Bar
tosh pulled the game out of the 
fire for BSR. The Phi Kaps ap
pear to be a cinch for the league 
title if they defeat Sigma Nu in 
next Wednesdays contest. A loss 
for the Sigma Nus would drop 
them to third place behind Beta 
Sig, who can be expected to beat 
(Tau Delta Phi. Should Sigma Nu 
win, the league would be thrown 
into a three-way tie. This situa
tion would also be produced in 
the Kiltie League should ATO beat 
Kappa Sig.

top-notch gridiron stars; end 
Larry Cassett, guard Tony Capul, 
and tackle Dick Chalupa.
Star Catcher Cassett
Larry Cassett, star Tartan pass 
receiver, is an all-around athlete. 
The 175-pound end plays well in 
almost every sport.
Larry, in addition to holding up 
the receiving end of the Scot's j 
aerial attack, participates in many 
intramural sports. He plays bas
ketball, softball, pool, volleyball, 
and ping pong. Last year Larry 
and Don Less were the doubles 
! champions in ping pong. Two 
years ago he played on the freshi man basketball team. In line with 
his active participation in his po
sition of member of the intra
mural board.
At Corry High School Larry 
was very active in sports. He was 
a standout in four varsity sports 
 football, basketball, track, and 
golf. He quarterbacked a topnotch football squad for three 
years. He was guard on the bas
ketball team and sparkled in the 
high jump in track. In golf Larry 
made second man on the team, j 
with an 80 average score. Also, j 
he played catcher in Junior ; 
American Legion Baseball for two

In the climactic finish of regular 
league play, the Delta Tau DeltaChi O team took two out of three 
games from the previously un

squad.
The Pikas took the first 
15-11, but the Delts came on 
strongly to sweep the last two 
15-7 and 15-6. Sigma Nu Thetas 
won their first match over the 
still winless Beta-Kappa team 11- 
15, 15-0, 15-10. The final league 
standings show DTD-ChiOs 
P i K A-Independents in second, 
SN-Thetas third, and BTP-KKG

blocking and all-around good 
sportsmanship.
Tony attended Clairton High 
School where he played guard for 
three years. One of his biggest 
moments came in a high school 
game when he was in on a block
ed kick and caught the ball. Tony 
ran 35 yards and would have 
scored his only touchdown, ex
cept that the ball was called back 
because of a penalty.
In his senior year at Clairton, 
1953, a great honor was bestowed 
upon Tony. He was selected for 
the ALL-WPIAL football team, a 
team which is composed of play
ers selected from over 200 high 
school teams.
At Carnegie Tech Tony is in
swimming, golf, basketball, and 
of course football. He is a mem
ber of Theta Xi Fraternity and 
belongs to the C-Club and the 
ASME.
Dick has two more years to 
think about his future after 
graduation. He is, however, mak
ing plans to apply his mechanical 
engineering education in industry.
Dick Chalupa
Tony Capul
a number of intramural sports. He 
plays IM basketball, softball, and 
pool. Tony is also a member of 
the Varsity C-Club.
His plans for the future arent 
too definite as yet. The past sum
mer Tony worked for the Irvin 
Works of United States Steel, and 
is interested in working in some 
phase of steelmaking.
Top Tackle Chalupa 
First string Tartan tackle Dick 
Chalupa was a three-letter man at 
Springfield (Pennsylvania) High 
School. The 6-2, 205 pound letterman played three years of varsity 
football as tackle. He was co
captain of the team in his senior 
year. Big Dick also earned letters 
in track and basketball.
After his high school gradua
tion, Dick moved to Kansas City, 
Missouri. In Autumn, 1955 Dick 
entered Tech as a mechanical en
gineering student.
In addition to bolstering the 
Scot line, Dick plays intramural 
basketball. He spends his spare 
time working on cars and playing 
his favorite sports, which include

rage !CARNEGIE TARTANTuesday, October St, 195
The Golden EraSports In
By Tom Beig
For this Golden Anniversary 
issue of the Tartan, lets take a 
look back at some highlights of a 
very interesting period of sports 
at Carnegie Tech, the transition 
period from the days of football 
glory through the de-emphasis of 
varsity sports.
Through the late 1920s and the 
30s Tech was regarded as a na
tional football power almost 
every Fall. The 1926 team is gen
erally regarded as Techs strong
est of the strong  that was the 
year that sophomore Howard 
Harpster led the Tartans to an 
upset victory over a Knute 
Rocknes Notre Dame power, and 
Lloyd Yoder was named an AllAmerican Tackle. Tech outscored 
its opposition 207 to 23, beating 
such teams as Pitt and West Vir
ginia, while losing to N.Y.U. and, 
believe it or not, W&J.
But the late 30s can rightfully 
be called the period when sports 
hit their peak here. In 1937 the 
Plaid once again up-ended a pre
viously unbeaten Notre Dame 
team, transforming a 2-5-1 record 
into a successful season, against 
such foes as Michigan State, Pur
due, Pitt, and Holy Cross. The 
next two years Tech lost the final 
games of its Notre Dame rivalry, 
7-0 and 7-6. In that 1939 esason, 
a small but lively trainload of 
Tech students accompanied the 
team to N.Y. City for the N.Y.U. 
game in Yankee Stadium.
Lambert Thophy 1938
Perhaps the greatest honor 
given to a Carnegie Tech team 
was the Lambert Trophy, award
ed to the sportswriters choice for 
the strongest team in the East, 
received by Tech in 1938. The 
Kilties journeyed to the Sugar 
Bowl during the holidays, but lost 
to T.C.U., 15-7. Techsters Ray
Connelly, Jack Lee, and Don 
Campbell played in the annual 
College All-Stars versus ProChampions benefit game follow
ing that year.
But Carnegies national powers 
werent restricted to the gridiron. 
Techs rifle team, still strong to
day, placed second in the 1939 
N.R.A. small-bore national cham
pionship, losing to Navy by a 
score of 1891 - 1871. Harold 
Greens nomination to the AllAmerican roster previewed John 
Herrs similar accomplishments of 
1955-56, and Russ McMillan was 
named to the All-American sec
ond team.
In those days the rifle team wras 
awarded a major letter for an ex
ceptionally fine season, and that 
award was earned four times in 
the eight years before and in
cluding that season.
Soccer, Hockey, Baseball
The level of enthusiasm for 
sports in the late 30s is further 
shown by the organization and 
existence of teams in soccer, 
hockey, and baseball. A soccer
Braivn Plus Brains 
Characterize Our 
Tech Trackmen
The old axiom that all athletes 
are brawn and no brain is rapid
ly being refuted and the Carnegie 
Tech Cross Country Squad goes 
a long way in doing this.
Four of the top six men on the 
squad are Deans List students 
with averages ranging last semes
ter from 3.18 to 3.53. The men 
are: Eric Ottervik, sophomore
physicist, who has finished first 
in five of the Scots six meets; 
Amie Olds, senior printing man
agement and a married veteran 
who also holds down a part-time 
job; Leonard Elikan, sophomore 
chemist; and Larry Bryant, a 
senior metallurgist. Ottervik, the 
ace of the squad, has had a 4.00 
factor in a previous semester.
In addition three of the four 
hold scholastic scholarships and 
all four are represented in the 
top scholastic honoraries: Scimi
tars, Delta Skull, Omicron Delta 
Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi.
team was begun in 1936, and 
scored an unimpressive record. 
With little pre-season practice 
and ineligibility problems, the 
booters surprised 1937 fans with a 
winning record and remained a 
power in western Pennsylvania 
until their dissolution late in the 
1940s.
Tech also had a strong winter 
sport besides basketball and 
swimming in hockey, until it also 
was discontinued toward mid
century. Baseball was less fortu
nate than other sports in that it 
lasted only one season. Organized 
in 1937, it was refused permission 
to use Techs name by the athletic 
council, and baseball has been 
unheard of thereafter.
In the early 40s Tech, like 
many smaller schools throughout 
the U.S., realized it could no 
longer support a big-time football 
team, and began de-emphasis. In 
1943, the Kilties met only five op
ponents, since many schools were 
dropping varsity athletics for the 
duration of World War II. The 
Kiltie Band bolstered its ranks 
that year with an unprecedented 
addition of three female march
ers. Tech also discontinued foot
ball the next season when 29 can
didates turned out, only eleven
of whom had played the game be
fore.
Post-War
The Fall of 1946 saw a world 
once again without war and a 
mass restitution of varsity sports 
at C.I.T.
Football stormed back under 
coach Bill Donohoe to a perfect 
record: won-none, tied-none,
points scored-none. Almost mar
ring this flawless record, Tech 
threatened twioe, once reaching 
the 9-yard line. Mike Theodore, 
today the Tartans freshman 
coach, returned from the Army 
to star on the basketball court as 
a sophomore. The swimming team 
picked up its perennially strong 
performance right away, and 
coach Halfertzs first cross-coun
try squad in three years brought 
home the best harrier record in 
many years.
De-emphasis was made com
plete in 1948 with the elimination 
of all major foes from the foot
ball schedule so that all opponents 
were in Techs class. The process, 
however, is actually still going on. 
The rivalries with Lehigh, begun 
in 1948, and Lafayette were dis
continued in 1955 and 56.
Football Upsets 
Ruin Predictions 
Of Contestants
Due to a misprint of the Michi
gan State-Illinois and IndianaNorthwestern games which listed 
MSU versus Indiana and Illinois 
versus Northwestern, the football 
contest for the past Saturday is 
declared null and void.
Even with the gift of an auto
matic correct solution on those 
two games the best anyone could 
do was eleven correct selections 
out of a possible fifteen. Games 
which stumped all of the yogis 
were Minnesotas upset of mighty 
Michigan and the Wake ForestNorth Carolina tie, which could 
hardly have been predicted, as 
North Carolina was heavily fa
vored. The Yale - Colgate game 
proved a bugaboo, also, as Col
gate abandoned its role of the 
weak sister of the Ivy League 
to top the Elis.
Irish Over Sooners?
No doubt most, if not all, of the 
entrants would have picked Michi
gan State to roll over dark-horse 
Illinois, but a fleet Ilinni back 
named Abe Woodson wrote finis 
to States dreams of a perfect sea
son and even knocked them out 
of the Big Ten Conference lead. 
One rash contestant even picked
Notre Dame over the Sooners of 
Oklahoma.
Prizes Continued
The past winners will receive a 
1957 Thistle for their efforts, as 
will any future winners. The con
test will appear again next week, 
so be ready.

approximately 5,000 people. Rep
resentatives from western Penn

The program was designed to 
familiarize visitors with the lab
oratories and other facilities, and 
to provide for consultation with 
faculty members on educational

Medical care in the form of 
medicine and X-ray equipment 
goes to the countries of Europe
and the East. Tuberculosis sana
toria and student health centers 
are constructed and operated by 
WUS in these same areas.
Students Helping Themselves 
One of the biggest problems
facing students of Asia and the 
Near East is lack of study mate
rials. Many students must use 
home-made or mimeographed text
books. The quantity and quality 
of textbooks is extremely limited.
WUS, with the help of American 
students particularly, supplies 
texts to thousands of students.
World University Service helps 
students to help themselves. Its 
agencies are often operated by
students themselves; its financial 
and medical program is geared to 
put the student in a position to 
meet his own needs adequately
and satisfactorily.

Even if you are just starting college in the Class of I960, 
we suggest that you take a long look at where you are going. 
Know, dont guess, what is offered by fields like engineering and 
science, finance, marketing and relations. Too often young 
people discover late in their senior year that they cant qualify 
for the career of their choice. Why be caught short? Selecting a 
career and knowing what is expected will make it possible for 
you to prepare for it now. Many graduates will find their place 
with industry. ^
General Electric is typical of many large industrial concerns. 
We employ over 27,000 college graduates from nearly 700 differ
ent colleges and universities. And our future, as the future of any 
progressive company, hinges on these people. Young men and 
women that have initiative, analytical and creative ability will 
make progress with industry. If you are interested, write for 
information about one or more of the programs listed on this 
page. These are the principal doorways to success at General 
Electric. The booklets can also be found at most college place
ment bureaus in a binder entitled Career Information.'
