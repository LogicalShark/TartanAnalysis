Graduates plan autonomy
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
This past Saturday, a commit
tee of Graduate Student Organi
zation (GSO) members, Student 
Senate members, and Student 
Body President Bryon Krug pre
sented a proposal to the Student 
Senate that would allow the GSO 
to split off from Student Senate 
and form its own, largely autono
mous student governing body.
The proposed system, say com
mittee members, will better re
flect the structure of graduate 
and undergraduate interaction on 
campus.
Even though grads and 
undergrads occupy the same 
space, we are very different 
groups, said Bill Slye, GSO Presi
dent and PhD candidate.
We are such a diverse group as 
it is. How could anybody expect 
Senate, which is 95 percent un
dergraduate, to represent us?
The Graduate Student Organi
zation has served fairly success
fully as the voice of graduate stu
dents for a number of years. All 
we want to do is to make sure 
that graduates, with their diverse 
needs, get the representation that 
we require.
Currently, 40 percent of stu
dent activities fees paid'by gradu
ate students are allocated directly 
to the GSO.
The Funding and Recognition 
Committee, which allocates stu
dent activities fees to undergradu
ate groups and to campus-wide 
activities (such as movies), re
ceives 60 percent of the graduate 
fees and all of the undergraduate 
fees.
The problem is that the Sen
ate rarely has graduate students 
in it, said Bryon Krug, student 
body president. The graduate 
students arent well-represented, 
especially on the Funding ComPlease see STRUCTURE, page 3

Campus Police enforce 
new traffic regulations
By JAYA SAXENA
Tartan Staffwriter
CMU police have taken on 
the new role as municipal offic
ers in dealing with traffic and 
pedestrian safety regulation on 
campus. In the past, traffic 
stops in the campus vicinity 
were strictly made by the City 
of Pittsburgh Police but Cam
pus Police officials will now en
force motor vehicle and pedes
trian violations in the CMU 
area.
Information about accidents 
and injuries at CMU and neigh
boring streets, complaints made 
by students and faculty, and a 
change in the attitude of cam
pus police, led university offi
cials to examine pedestrian and 
vehicle safety issues.
Beginning last week, they 
started placing greater empha
sis on issuing written warn
ings for traffic offenses. They 
will also issue state citations

Roberts Hall nears completion
Faculty move into new research facility
By MEENA VAGNIER
Tartan Staffwriter
The second and third floors of Roberts 
Hall were finished this past Wednesday, 
and faculty are moving into the offices. 
The rest of the construction is expected 
to be completed by April 1. When com
pleted, the first floor will have offices, 
and the fourth floor will have offices and 
a conference room.
Construction on the new building, 
between Hamerschlag Hall and Neville 
Street, began early in the spring of 1995. 
The construction of Roberts Hall was 
quite a task, according to Project Man
ager Peg Hart. After shutting down 
Neville Street so that the crew could get 
access to the building, Hart commented 
that getting the supplies down the dirt 
road was very hard and there was no 
other way to get to the building.
Roberts Hall is accessible from 
Hamerschlag Hall B level, and there 
will be a tunnel connecting the first floor 
[of Roberts] to Hamerschlag Hall D level. 
Hart said that the building will be used 
by the faculty and graduate students of

Astronauts fixed 
Hubble telescope
SPACE CENTER, Houston, 
Feb. 18 (AP)  After 33 weary 
hours of spacewalking, astro
nauts completed their tuneup of the Hubble Space Tele
scope along with some lastminute repairs to its sun-blistered skin Tuesday.
Externally, I have to say its 
not quite as beautiful as we left 
it three years ago, Mission 
Controls Jeffrey Hoffman told 
the crew of space shuttle Discov
ery . But we all know that beauty 
is only skin deep and the real 
guts of the Hubble are even bet
ter now because of the great 
work that you guys have done.
Hoffman thanked the Discov
ery astronauts for all the TLC 
(tender loving care) they gave 
to Hubble.
Astronauts Mark Lee and 
Steven Smith ended the fifth 
and final spacewalk of the $795 
million servicing mission with 
repairs to Hubbles peeling ther
mal insulation, the result of 
seven years of sun exposure.
The pilots, raised Discovery 
 and thus Hubble  into a 
higher orbit to offset the 
telescopes natural decline in 
altitude until the astronauts 
next visit in late 1999. Hubbles 
new orbit is 375 to 385 miles

high, almost 10 miles higher 
than before.
It will be two to three months 
before NASA knows whether 
the two new science instru
ments on the $2 billion tele
scope are working properly. 
Scientists hope to look further 
back in space and in time with 
the near-infrared camera and 
the two-dimensional imaging 
spectrograph, installed during 
spacewalk No. 1 last week.
Altogether, Lee, Smith, Gregory Harbaugh, and Joe Tanner 
installed 11 major Hubble com
ponents, worth nearly $300 mil
lion, during four consecutive 
nights of spacewalking. The fifth 
spacewalk was added so Lee and 
Smith could hang homemade 
patches over tearsin Hubbles 
thin, reflective insulation.
The astronauts' total time 
outside was 33 hours and 11 
minutes, just two hours shy 
of the five spacewalks con
ducted in 1993 to fix Hubbles

The only snag in the mission 
was a failure in Hubbles power 
system because of an error by 
ground controllers. It will just

Former cadet 
claims hazing
NEW YORK, Feb. 18 (UPI)  
A former female cadet at South 
Carolinas Citadel says it was four 
months of brutal hazing at the 
hands of male upperclassmen 
that drove her and another young 
woman from the military college.
Jeanie Mentavlos tells the New 
York Times today (Tuesday) the 
hazing included midnight kick
ing sessions and using nail polish 
remover to set fire to her clothes.
Mentavlos said the harassment 
started soon after she and an
other female cadet, Kim Messer, 
arrived at the Citadel campus 
last summer.
She said male cadets gathered 
on balconies to make lewd cat
calls at the women.
It was bad; it was terrible. We 
just had to endure it. Both of us 
were scared just to walk to class, 
she said.
Although hazing has been a 
hallmark of the institution thr
oughout its 153-year history, 
the practice has attracted in
creased scrutiny since female 
cadets were first admitted two 
years ago.
Two other women who were 
enrolled at the Citadel at the same 
time as Mentavlos and Messer 
say they were not harassed.
Iranian charity 
hikes bounty
TEHRAN, Feb. 12 (Reuter). 
An Iranian foundation has raised 
the reward for the killing of Brit
ish author Salman Rushdie to 
$2.5 million, an Iranian newspa
per reported on Wednesday.
The 15th Khordad Foundation 
first offered a bounty in 1989 af
ter Irans late leader Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini issued a 
fatwa, or religious edict, impos
ing the death sentence on 
Rushdie for alleged blasphemy 
against Islam in his novel The 
Satanic Verses.
The daily Jomliuri Eslami 
quoted the charitys head, Aya
tollah Hassan Sanei, as saying 
that the reward had been in
creased to $2.5 million from the 
original $2 million.
The prize for executing Salman 
Rushdie is not limited to Mus
lims. Anybody  Muslim or nonMuslim and even his (Rushdies) 
bodyguards  who carries it out 
will receive the prize, said 
Sanei, who is the personal rep
resentative at the foundation of 
Irans supreme leader Ayatol
lah Ali Khamenei.
The winner of the bounty would 
also receive all amounts accumu
lated from depositing the sum in 
banks since the award was an
nounced, Sanei said.
Irans President Akbar Hashemi 
Rafsanjani said on Wednesday his 
government had nothing to do with 
the increased award. That foun
dation isnon-governmental and 
its decisions have nothing to do 
with the governments policies, 
Rafsanjani told a news confer
ence.
Iranian officials say the death 
threat is a purely religious mat
ter, unrelated to the government. 
Tehran has said it would not pur
sue Rushdie but also stresses it 
cannot withdraw a religious edict.
New tests will 
analyze rifle
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 21 (AP) 
 James Earl Rays hopes for a 
trial and acquittal are still alive 
after a judge decided that new 
technology could determine if 
Rays rifle fired the shot that 
killed Martin Luther King Jr.
Judge Joe Browns Thursday 
decision must be reviewed by the 
same state appeals court that 
rejected Rays request for tests 
on the rifle in 1994. Brown must 
await the review before decid
ing whether to allow new tests 
on the hunting rifle and the 
bullet that killed King in 1968.
This is like preliminary to the 
preliminary, said John Campbell, 
a state prosecutor.
Ray, 68, pleaded guilty in 1969 
but recanted almost immediately, 
arguing that he was set up. Now 
serving a 99-year prison sentence, 
Ray has terminal liver disease, 
and his bid for a trial is backed 
by the King family.
Mr. Ray is our last hope to 
reveal the truth about my 
husbands assassination and 
bring about at least some sense of 
closure to the pain we have en
dured as a family over unan
swered questions surroundingthis 
tragedy, Coretta Scott King, 
Kings widow, told the judge.
Rays conviction has been up
held seven times by state and 
federal courts. Prosecutors say 
he has exhausted his appeals and 
contend a trial would do little to 
satisfy those who believe he was 
the victim of a conspiracy.
Were talking about a complete 
gamble to see if anything extra 
can come out of a trial of Mr. Ray 
when in fact what we have is a 
valid conviction, Campbell said.
Conspiracy theorists have ar
gued that Ray, a petty criminal, 
could not have pulled off the as
sassination alone. The theories 
note that authorities have never 
proven that Rays gun was the 
murder weapon.
Ray contends the .30-06 
Remington rifle found at the 
murder scene with his fingerprints 
on it was put there by conspirators 
trying to frame him.
Ray said he brought the rifle to 
Memphis on instructions from a 
shadowy gun runner he knew only 
as Raoul. Authorities have never 
established that Raoul existed.
The FBI and the U.S. House 
Select Committee on Assassina
tions tested the rifle in the 1970s 
but could not establish that it 
was the murder weapon. The 
tests did show that King was 
killed by the same kind of gun.
The judge decided that the tech
nology is better than it was in the 
late 1970s, when the rifle was 
last examined.
U.S. begs to 
differ with WTO
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (AP) 
 On the same day, the Clinton 
administration asked the World 
Trade Organization to resolve 
one trade dispute but said it 
wouldnt cooperate in efforts to 
settle another.
On Thursday, the WTO estab
lished a panel to decide whether 
a U.S. law punishing non-American companies doing business in 
Cuba was illegal under the rules 
of international commerce.
The administration reacted 
immediately, saying it would 
boycott proceedings and de
nouncing the 15-nation Euro
pean Unions complaint that 
sparked the WTO move. It de
clared that the Helms-Burton 
Act reflected U.S. security in
terests and therefore was out
side the jurisdiction of the
Geneva-based trading body.
The WTO is not an appropri. 
ate forum for resolving differences 
over what is essentially a dis
agreement over foreign policy, 
said Undersecretary of Commerce 
Stuart E. Eisenstat.
That action would seem to 
please U.S. critics of the WTO 
who argue that the organization, 
where each country will have just 
one vote regardless of its size, 
represents a dangerous threat to 
American sovereignty.
Eisenstats statement came 
only minutes before acting U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky, in a separate an
nouncement, said the U.S. would 
submit to the WTO a complaint 
against Japan, alleging it 
limited the sale of imported pho
tographic film and paper in the 
Japanese market.
In Tokyo, Japans Ministry of 
International Trade and' Indus
try released a statement calling 
the U.S. allegations groundless 
and pledging to rebut 
Washingtons claims at the WTO.
The case pits Eastman Kodak 
against Fuji Photo Film, its glo
bal competitor.
The combined effect of the two 
cases could have a serious impact 
on the WTO, which the U.S. was 
instrumental in creating in 1995 
out of the old General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade.
Successive administrations 
have believed the WTOs ex
panded powers will give the 
United States more clout 
breaking down complex barriers 
to trade. But the administrations 
refusal to answer the first major 
complaint against the United 
States or abide by the panels 
ruling raises the question of 
whether other nations: might do 
the same when their commercial 
interests are at stake.,
In its own filing to the WTO, 
Japan called for the organization 
to also review its allegations oi 
unfair barriers against foreign 
companies in the U.S. market.
Tokyo has until early April to 
- reply to the 200-page U.S. state
ment. After further arguments, s 
decision is expected in October.
By then, the Cuban panel-is 
expected to have reached a de
cision on the EU complaint 
a precedent will have been set if 
the administration persists in 
its stated determination to ig
nore it.
Supreme Court hears arguments on freedom of religion
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (AP) 
 Congress improperly stripped 
the courts of some of their au
thority to interpret the Constitu
tion when it passed a 1993 law to 
promote religious freedom, a law
yer for a Texas city told the Su
preme Court today. The justices 
are expected to rule by July.
How far can Congress go to 
ensure constitutional guaran
tees? asked attorney Marci 
Hamilton, who represents a Texas 
town in a dispute with a Catholic 
church that could lead to one of 
the high courts most important 
religious freedom decisions.
Our argument is it certainly 
cant go to the point where Con
gress can reinterpret the mean
ing of the Constitution, she said.
At issue is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that says 
government cannot substan
tially burden a persons religious 
freedom unless there is a compel
ling government interest.
Hamilton said the law also im
properly overrides state laws, 
subjecting them to the tough con
stitutional standard.
University of Texas professor 
Douglas Laycock, representing 
the church, defended the law, 
calling its impact a mile wide 
and an inch deep. Also, he said 
Congress always has had the 
power to make constitutional 
rights effective in practice.
Several justices questioned 
whether the 1993 law can be used 
by religious institutions to free 
themselves from other govern
ment rules. Justice Sandra Day
OConnor asked whetherreligious 
groups could avoid paying state 
taxes on non-religious businesses.
Acting Solicitor General Walter 
Dellinger, the Clinton adminis
trations top courtroom lawyer, 
said the answer is no. He noted 
religious groups first must prove 
such rules constitute a substan
tial burden to them.
The case stems from a dispute 
over building permits between a 
Catholic church in Boeme, Texas, 
and city officials.
Squeezed for space because of a 
growing congregation, St. Peters 
petitioned to expand its 230-seat 
sanctuary. The town of Boerne 
refused to give permission in 1994 
on grounds that the church, an 
imposing Spanish-style struc
ture built in 1923, is in a historic district.
The Catholic archbishop of San 
Antonio sued, saying the 1993 
law shields the church from his
toric preservation ordinances. A 
federal judge sided with Boeme, a 
town of some 4,000 people a halfhours drive from San Antonio^ 
finding the law unconstitutional.
Congress enacted the law in 
response to a 1990 Supreme Court 
decision that said laws otherwisf 
neutral toward religion are not 
unconstitutional just because 
they may infringe on the reli
gious beliefs of some people. In its 
1990 ruling in an Oregon case 
involving Indian rituals, the 
court held that there was no 
constitutional right to take the 
hallucinogenic drug peyote as a 
religious practice.

The new Joint Funding Commit

Building a brighter future...
Roberts makes room for research
ROBERTS, from page 1
the researchers in Hamerschlag Hall. 
Its going to be nice for us when [all the 
DSSC people] move in and were all in 
the same building because it will be 
easier for coordination and for us to 
communicate, said Meg Papa, the DSSC 
project assistant. Jim Williams, the 
DSSC customer representative, said, 
Having people of different departments 
in one building will make the research 
much easier with a better team focus in 
which more people can benefit from the 
research.
Williams also said, [The completion 
of Roberts] will make it easier to do 
interdisciplinary research which is what 
the facility is for.
The faculty that are currently in the 
building were previously in 
Hamerschlag Hall and Hamburg Hall. 
According to Hart, they had very little 
space in their labs and hardly a place for 
research.
Roberts is equippedwithbreakrooms, 
restrooms, wash rooms, one elevator, 
and is handicap accessible. It is named 
after the major contributor and Mate
rial Scientist and graduate of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, George Rob
erts.
The building was designed by the firm 
of Payette Associates, whose key mem
ber on this project was also a CMU 
graduate, George Marsh.
The building has four floors and abase
ment in which there are no classrooms, 
just offices. The building will be used 
primarily for faculty, graduate students, 
and research teams. The first floor will 
have offices and labs, and currently the 
second and third floors have offices occu
pied and labs which are being completed 
for use. No labs are in use at this time, 
only offices. We hope to move the labs in 
mid-March, Hart said and then be able 
to use them. The unique part of the third 
floor that no other floor has labs that will
be shielded from radio frequency waves. 
These labs are split into three sizes: one 
large, one medium, and two small so that 
more people can use them.
The radio waves have been proven to 
influence the research, Hart said.
The fourth floor, which is not fully 
completed yet, will have various pur
poses. It has a multiple-purpose/conference room which will be primarily used 
for seminars and meetings. The fourth 
floor also has a library to which George 
Roberts will be donating his personal 
library.
The fourth floor also has a long terrace 
that extends the length of the building, 
and when the project is completely fin
ished will overlook a landscaped area 
according to Hart.
The completion of Roberts will give the 
Universitys CIT faculty and graduates 
more space to conduct experiments and 
research projects and will serve as a hub 
for CIT.

FUNDS, from page 1
move quickly, AB is afraid that there 
will be no band for Carnival.
According to Jill Goodall, the chair 
of AB and a fifth-year-scholar psychol
ogy major, AB contacted a booking 
agent to find out which bands would 
be available to perform during Carni
val, but only Barenaked Ladies were 
available from an initial list of 15 to 20 
bands.
So many 
bands are already coming to j 
Pittsburgh.
Thats what 
eliminated a lot 
of the bands.
The other thing 
is money. I think 
Bush is about 
$100,000 now, 
said Goodall. AB will know whether 
Barenaked Ladies will accept the invi
tation to perform at Carnival at the 
end of this week. Tons of students 
suggested to make the carnival big
ger, especially with the bands. I dont 
know if The Bare Naked Ladies were 
specifically suggested, said Krug.
Several students recommended that 
the money be spent on Carnival 
improvments. Its my last year here. 
Fd like to see a really big name band 
and have a good Carnival. I was think
ing a bigger name band than in the 
past, but I dont have any special sug
gestions, said Ryan Snodgrass, a se
nior computer science major. Kyle 
Oppenheim, a sophomore ECE major 
said,My first suggestion was to put 
money into student organizations, 
but carnival entertainment is a good
idea too.
Approximately 700 students gave 
suggestions onhowto spend the money 
through a bboard, email to Bryon 
Krug, and suggestion boxes through
out campus. Keri Mills, a sophomore 
chemical engineering major and mem
ber of the Surplus Commission said, 
Its something that will affect every
one, so people got involved. Snodgrass 
said, Its not often that
we get to say something in how our 
money is spent. Other students, 
such as Beth Franklin, a senior His
tory major was motivated to enter a 
suggestion because of the $50 raffle.
Although they are still taking sug
gestions, the commission is focused 
on finding out the costs for various 
projects. Were at the point where 
were looking for closure, said John 
Muir, a junior political science ma
jor, the chair for Human Resources 
for Student Senate, and member of 
the Surplus Commission.
After determining which projects 
are economically feasible, the Sur
plus Commission will make a final 
recommendation on how to spend 
the remaining portion of the $80,000 
at the Student Senate meeting on 
March 6.

age by creating a better environment for 
students, LaPaglia said.
Some of the main traffic problems in
clude the high speed of traffic and the need
Traditionally, it has not been part of for more traffic signs for pedestrian crossour job to enforce state motor vehicle 
laws. We left that up to the City of 
Pittsburgh police but we feel that this 
campus is not getting the complete ser
vice we should be getting, said Director 
of Security James LaPaglia. Our pri
mary purpose is to improve security
and safety for our ______________
students on and 
around our campus.
It is a proven fact 
that traffic enforce
ment reduces inju
ries, he said.
Twenty-nine traffic 
accidents were re
ported on campus 
from January 1994 to 
November 1996.
Some of these incidences occurred on the 
adjacent roads leading to the University 
such as Forbes Avenue, More wood Av
enue, and Margaret Morrison Street. 
Nine of these accidents resulted in inju
ries requiring medical attention, with 
three involving pedestrians being hit by 
cars. Twenty-eight of these accidents 
occurred between 7 am and 11 pm. We 
encounter the most problems during the 
busiest times, in early morning hours 
and later in the afternoon, LaPaglia 
said.
Early last fall, a safety scan was ad
ministered to assessed the strengths 
and weaknesses of security in the cam
pus environment. Pedestrian and ve
hicle safety was one major area found to 
be in need of improvement. The com
plaints being made have not changed. 
Our response to them has changed. 
People did not view us as being traffic
ing on Forbes Avenue. Safety along Forbes 
Avenue has been a major issue of concern 
in recent years. The installation of a traf
fic light across from Hamburg Hall is one 
of the most significant actions that has 
helped to make Forbes a little safer, said 
LaPaglia. The need for identifiable crosswalks on all streets of campus, especially 
at Margaret Morrison Street and Tech 
Street. We received a very positive re
sponse from [City of Pittsburgh Dparti 
ment of Planning]. I am looking forward to 
having them work with us, LaPaglia said!. 
No official plans have been initiated.
According to LaPaglia, there are two 
major things students can do to protect 
themselves from dangerous situations. 
Crossing within the crosswalk at the walk 
signal on Forbes Avenue is very impori 
tant. In most incidences, the pedestrian
"Traditionally, it has not been part of our job to en
force state motor vehicle laws ...we feel that this 
campus is not getting the complete service we should 
be getting. 
 James LaPaglia, Director of Security
walks throughout the University is an
other area of concern. Campus Police have 
also received complaints about cars failing 
to stop at stop signs and bicycles being 
driven in a reckless manner. One recur
rent problem has been students riding 
bicycles inside academic buildings. We 
would like to take a more proactive role in 
promoting bicycle safety, LaPaglia said.
Campus Police met with representatives 
of the City of Pittsburgh Department of 
Planning on January 8 to express their 
concern about safety in the CMU area and 
to ask for assistance.
Some possible action items that were 
mentioned included identifying locations 
where traffic control devices would be ap
propriate, such as at the intersection of 
Forbes and the driveway leading up to the 
University Center; new signs warning 
motorists of pedestrian crossings, and 
painting or repainting pedestrian cross
is found to be at fault. We need to take 
ownership for our own safety. It is espe^ 
daily important to be vigilant at Margaret 
Morrison Street and Tech Street because 
we have found that many vehicles do not 
stop for stop signs in that area, LaPaglia 
said.
Another thing he said students should 
keep in mind is when riding a bicycle, 
always yield to the pedestrian and ride at 
a safe, slow speed. Weaving through traf
fic and riding at a high speed are ex
tremely dangerous, he said.
Campus Police is comprised of 21 sworn 
officers, trained just as municipal officers, 
with 15 uniformed patrol officers guard
ing the streets 24 hours a day. Currently!, 
they are also looking into other safety 
issues such as theft in academic buildings. 
LaPaglia said crimes of violence are very 
rare in academic buildings although theft 
at these sites remains a large problem. 
Crime and Incident Report
ASSAULT 2/18, 9:03 pm  A CMU 
student was riding his bicycle on Forbes 
Avenue when the occupants of a large 
tan sedan yelled at him. The bicycle 
rider turned onto Morewood Avenue and

get out. The two began to tussle, and the 
visitor butted the room occupant with 
his head.
Then, the visitor started dribbling a 
basketball. The room occupant tried to 
knock the ball away, and the visitor 
punched the occupant. The occupant

Letters to the Editor
Carnegie Mellon University24 February 1997
Students need update 
on Presidential search
As CMUs presidential search 
continues, the administration has 
still made no official announce
ment of prospective candidates to 
fill President Mehrabians shoes 
in the fall.
According to a statement from 
the Board of Trustees last No
vember, several candidates have 
visited the campus and by now 
the list has been narrowed down 
to three.
While the administration has 
obviously made giant leaps in the 
search, the majority of the stu
dent body has been left in the 
dark, due to a lack of communica
tion on the part of Warner Hall 
and a lack of interest shown by 
most students.
The administration attempted 
to encourage student input on 
issues that should be addressed 
during the next presidency last 
semester by establishing a Stu
dent Liaison committee, a group 
of students serving as a link be
tween the administration and 
students.
Although these meetings were 
poorly advertised and poorly at
tended, the committee has made 
an effort to keep those who did 
attend updated about the progress 
of the search.
Members of the committee have 
recently published a bookie,t ad
dressed to the administration, 
that lists student concerns.
The search for a president re
quires the involvement of both 
students and the administration
 the ramifications of such a de
cision affect the entire campus. 
Students should understand the 
implications of a new president; 
issues that most take for granted 
from financial aid and scholar
ships to the distribution of Stu
dent Undergraduate Research 
Grants stem in part from the Of
fice of the President.
The President influences what 
type of alumni are sought out for 
contributions to the institution 
and therefore which departments 
are affected by campaign mon
eys. Students are obviously af
fected by this kind of change.
By not keeping students in
formed of progress, the gulf be
tween administration and stu
dents continues to widen. Admin
istrators needs to set the ground
work for the new president by 
bridging this gulf and, in the pro
cess, easing the transition be
tween leaderships.
The administration needs to 
make an effort to reach out to 
students and explain who the 
possible candidates are. More 
student interview groups should 
be held so when a decision is 
reached, most students wont 
find it a surprise.
And when the administration of
fers these opportunities to get in
volved, students should show in
terest  groups such as the Stu
dent Liaison Committee cannot 
represent the opinions and con
cerns of the student body if we 
choose not to care until it is too late.
Special interest 
groups limit housing
Special interest housing pro
vides students with a unique 
Opportunity  to live together 
based on common interest. Other 
programs such as quiet living 
areas and the new wellness hous
ing program offer students simi
lar living options within Uni
versity housing.
However, each of these special 
options comes at a cost: for each 
Space blocked off by Student Life 
for a specific group, a space open 
of the general student population 
is restricted.
; Space is already tight. For the 
past several years, Housing has 
been forced to temporarily locate 
incoming first-year students in 
ihe Hamptonlnn. Because special 
interest housing groups usually 
consist of upper-class students and 
other housing options (such as 
quiet living) are filled during Room 
Draw, these spaces are almost in
accessible to first-year students.
 Similarly, upper-class students 
who wish to change rooms have 
less chance of getting their firstChoice dorm if a portion of that 
space has been blocked off for a 
Special interest group or other 
housing option.
Part of the problem stems from 
the fact that special interest hous
ing is handled by the Student Life 
Office; University Housing has 
no input into how many special 
interest groups will receive re
served areas and how large these 
areas will be. Housing simply re
ceives information from Student
Editor:
We are 
writing in
Life on how many spaces will be 
allocated to these groups and 
where to put them. If Housing 
set an upper limit based on ex
pected demand in the coming 
year, rooms would be more ac
cessible to first-year students 
and returning students wishing 
to remain on campus.
Restricting special interest 
housing and similar groups to offcampus apartments would pro
vide the same benefits of these 
programs but leave on-campus 
housing free for first-year stu
dents. Having freshmen on cam
pus gives them chance to meet 
others and get involved in ac
tivities. For some students, it 
makes a difference in their aca
demic success during the first 
year of college.
While special interest housing 
is a valuable aspect of the hous
ing system, the term special 
interest needs to be redefined 
and perhaps limited in order 
provide housing choices for other 
students. Some of the groups 
that seem to show a need to live 
together, with the help of Stu
dent Life, are questionable. Even 
if ample housing is available, 
the number of desirable rooms 
will no longer be an option un
less a student belongs to an in
terest group.
As it stands students are slowly 
being discouraged from finding 
a space to meet new people and 
explore another social aspect of 
CMU.

Warfields the Editor 
letter published last week, but 
more importantly, to clarify an 
apparent misconception which 
may be shared by more than 
Mr. Warfield. We are refer
ring to the idea that Kappa 
Delta Rho and Zeta Psi Sigma 
are striving to distance them
selves from the Greek system 
on campus. The misconcep
tion stems from Kappa Delta 
Rho referring to their frater
nity as the un-frat and a 
sister from Zeta Psi Sigma 
referring to her sorority as 
the un-sorority. These ref
erences are not intended to 
separate our organization 
from the CMU Greek system. 
In fact, our organizations are 
proud to be part of the Greek 
system, and we not only re
spect and appreciate our 
Greek counterparts, but we 
also recognize the immense 
value and worth of each indi
vidual fraternity and soror
ity on this campus.
The aforementioned refer
ences are intended to break 
stereotypes which inhibit 
membership recruitment, the 
lifeline of our organizations. 
Many of our members came 
to school with less-than-accurate perceptions of Greek 
life, and eventually were 
made aware of the value that 
membership in a Greek orga
nization can add to the col
lege experience. Because of 
our own members admitted 
misconceptions of Greek life, 
we felt the need to address this 
problem through the use ofthose 
references during this past 
Rush. Again, the references 
were not intended to express 
criticism or disapproval of 
the Greek system.
In conclusion, we would like 
to thank Mr. Warfieldfor voic
ing his deep concern, and hope 
we have quelled his intense 
anxiety. More importantly, 
we hope that we have cleared 
up any misunderstandings 
concerning our use of the 
terms un-frat and un-so
rority, and invite any mem
bers of the campus commu
nity who would like to learn 
more about our organizations 
to stop by.

correct in asserting that 
graduation from CMU does 
not totally prepare a student 
for life. However, I must dis
agree with his suggestion that 
the school provide courses 
teaching social skills.
Fortunately, through the 14 
fraternities found on campus, 
CMU does provide its young 
men with the opportunity to 
learn many things about life 
which cannot be taught in 
the classroom.
Involvement in the Greek 
system can get a student out 
of the largely age-segregated 
dorms and into an environ
ment where seniors and fresh
men are highly involved in 
each others lives. A young 
student can learn a lot about 
what is needed to succeed in 
college and post-grad life from 
the older students and alumni 
in a Greek organization.
Social and organizational 
skills can also be learned by a 
fraternity man through host
ing social activities of his taste 
in his own home as well as 
working with other members 
on projects that could never 
be completed individually. 
Leadership experience is 
gained by every member who 
takes the responsibility of di
recting a portion of the 
fraternitys actions through 
his elected office.
There are countless things 
a person can learn by living 
and working so closely with a 
group as diverse as many 
Greek organizations are.
If a male student thinks he 
cant find a fraternity where 
he would fit in, it would be 
wise to remember that a fra
ternity is nothing more than 
a group of college men liv
ing together.
Anything else a fraternity 
is to be is up to the members 
of that organization.
Fraternities are defined by 
their members, hence any two 
fraternities can be just as dif
ferent from each other as two 
people are.
The only thing every fra
ternity has in common with 
every other is that its mem
bers found advantage in co
operative living.

JtLQltOr: Letters to the EditorThe Tartan^ Student Center Room ItM (
writingin Letter to 
response
to the re the Editor
cent article in The Tartan 
concerning the postpone
ment of the Beaux Arts 
Ball. To begin with, the 
April 19th date referred to 
is incorrect and sets the 
stage for the articles entire 
negative argument.
The correct date is April 
12th, the Saturday of CamiNell Babra/Tartan Junior Staff
val weekend. The Ball has 
beenheld over Carnival week
end before and been a smash
ing success.
Furthermore, you discuss 
CFA as if it is this institution 
full of willing organizers who 
come together every other 
year and produce this magi
cal Ball celebrating the arts. 
The facts prove quite the con
trary. As of the end of No
vember 1996 there was no 
committee at all to produce 
the Ball, and it was in danger 
cancellation.
In an attempt to salvage 
the lost Ball, a group of ambi
tious seniors, including pro
ducers, Elske R. Free-Bemt, 
Tania M. Scheer, and Mary 
F. Velez Isip, and designers 
Somya W. Gutshall and 
Paulina Z. Berczynski, took 
over the planning at great 
personal sacrifice.
It is our wish that we will 
be able to present an elabo
rate celebration of the arts 
here at CMU for all of the 
University to enjoy, and re
member, as the stunning 
event it is intended to be.
I find it very unfortunate, 
and have a difficult time not 
feeling personally attacked, 
that The Tartan printed 
this article generating so 
much negative energy 
without even questioning 
us, as the Beaux Arts Ball 
committee, about our mo
tives and intentions.
I hope that the effort that 
we five have made to con
tinue and strengthen a long
standing tradition here at 
CMU will be sincerely ap
preciated after we as a uni
versity have indulged our 
senses in the Beaux Arts 
Ball of April 12th, 1997.

r James Stepanek
Wouldnt it be neat to be able to buy 
your grades? How about if a prof put 
together a syllabus that you didnt like 
and you were able to buy him off so that 
he changed it more to your liking? 
Wouldnt that be nice? With good grades 
going to the highest bidder, we could 
forget all that merit nonsense.
Well, try substituting the President 
for the professor and national policy for 
the syllabus. According to a host of 
allegations, the Clinton administration 
has been for sale for quite a while. A 
large number of donors to the Demo
cratic National Committee (DNC) have 
been favored with interviews with 
the President, and in some cases, large 
donors have found policy changes that 
work in their favor to be the result of 
a check to the DNC.
Yes, once again, its time to dismiss 
me as a right-wing crank for disparag
ing the valiant President Bubba, but 
can you dismiss articles in the Wash
ington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and 
the Reuters news wire? The evidence is 
mounting that the Clinton administra
tion is about as corrupt as the office has 
ever been (with all due respect to Ulysses 
S. Grant). In a February 16 article from 
Reuters, some curious facts about Guam 
were discussed. It appears that a major 
policy shift in the governance of this 
territory occurred soon after $900,000 
was given to the DNC. The territorial 
government was given powers which it 
had desired for a number of years, 
namely, the ability to control immigra
tion. Another story, this one in the Los 
Angeles Times (Feb. 17), talks about a 
bidding war between Taiwan and China 
for political favoritism in the White 
House. Both sides appear to have been 
throwing money at the DNC, but it seems 
that playing both sides off against each 
other has been more profitable than 
taking sides. Of course, foreign dona
tions in any form are illegal, but whos 
checking? The number of campaign fi
nance law violations by the DNC and the 
Clinton White House is so large, its 
almost unreal. Every day, we hear a new 
story about how the Democrats are giv
ing back another donation because it 
was illegal. Why arent people scream
ing bloody murder? Whats the response 
to all this stuff from the Left? Cam
paign finance reform is the catch-phrase 
which suggests a miraculous solution to
all the problems. Of course the fact that 
Clinton and his cronies have already 
broken the collection of laws that we 
have right now suggests that making 
more laws will have a notably useless 
effect. (Hmm, kind of reminds me of gun 
control). Further, theres the fact that 
Clinton is so brazen as to call for finance 
reform even while hes out collecting 
money in ways that he suggests should 
be illegal (Reuters Feb. 18). The funda
mentally stupid thing about the finance 
reform response is that the problem was 
not that lots of money was raised (though 
some might say this), but that the DNC 
and Clintons people collected illegal 
money. They also very likely sold out the 
U.S. government to foreign interests. 
This sounds like a bloody banana repub
lic. The issue of finance reform impugns 
both parties equally, yet if the Republi
cans had done any such acts as the DNC 
have admitted doing, theyd have the 
press crawling down their collective 
throat. The fact that Janet Reno has not 
appointed an independent council to in
vestigate this matter is a travesty.

Does the Internet supply tools for education?
Internet provides wealth of knowledge
Ellen Beldner
Several weeks ago, a British professor 
released the results of an informal study 
he had done with two of his classes. One 
group of students was taught entirely 
over the Internet, using web pages, 
chat rooms, and email to spread infor
mation from the professor to his stu
dents. The other group learned in a 
lecture-style setting.
The professor concluded that students 
learning over the Internet did just as 
well as those who learned in a tradi
tional format.
As the Internet gains ubiquity in Ameri
can society, everyone from lawmakers to 
college students has been debating its 
merits and faults. Indeed, now that 
Internet use has spread well beyond its 
original bounds as the toy of academics 
and military scientists, many people with
out such a pressing need for information 
decry the Internet as nothing more than 
an ever-burgeoning source of entertain
ment and amusement.
However, as the Internet expands to 
include more and more sources of infor
mation, people are stepping up to utilize 
that information in many different ways. 
With the Internet, we can access copies of 
rare historical documents, research ab
stracts from half a world away, and down
load classical works of literature.
It is the Internet, with its terabytes of 
data, which can make distant and hidden 
information instantly accessible.
Far from being a mere web of play
things, the Internet erases the geographi
cal and physical boundaries that hereto
fore curtailed the ebb and flow of the raw 
data needed to make inferences and con
clusions about the world around us.
It is true that information itself is not 
the answer to many of societys problems; 
if we rely on nothing but fact, we turn into 
the Bitzer of Charles Dickens Hard 
Times, who defines a horse as Quadru
ped. Graminivorous.
Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grind
ers, four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive. 
Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy coun
tries, sheds hoofs, too.... Pure fact does
not constitute intelligence, but when we 
have information, we become better 
equipped to understand the hows and 
the whys of the world around us.
The entire United States Code is online, 
as are decisions of the United States 
Supreme Court and countless state law 
resources. Scientific American is online, 
accompanied by Strunk and Whites Ele
ments of Style and Platos Republic. Cer
tainly, it is possible to find these things in 
a local library. But there is far more on 
the Internet than these standard docuEducation requires human interaction

There has been much talk lately about 
the dumbing of America. Its ironic that, 
although we live in the so-called Informa
tion Age, America should be so uninformly 
referred to as dumb. Yet everyday people 
condemn the stupidity of average citi"l ji/itpt/f di-f]

ments, and the Internet raises the qual
ity of research and interpretation when 
a student has access to reproductions 
of original documents while writing a 
paper on 16th century China.
The Internet is not the end-all and 
be-all of life. People will still continue 
to read printed material; and because 
old habits die hard, its not likely that 
preschoolers will power up their com
puters for their virtual addition lesson 
instead of heading off to the kindergar
ten room each morning.
And perhaps the Internet fosters an
tisocial behavior. But that does not 
mean that we should discount the value 
of the Internet and its power to teach 
and to explain.

zens, who are supposedly consumers of 
trash  through their eyes, their ears, 
and their mouths. It is also a common 
feeling that the Internet is potentially a 
tool for solving this problem, or at least 
curtailing it.
But the Internet is an unlikely instru
ment of Americas intellectual salva
tion. After all, to anyone on-line, the 
Internet is a disappointing source of 
knowledge and education. Its disorga
nized, inefficient, unreliable, and full 
of mindless trash.
Currently, the Internet is too chaotic 
and inexact to be an excellent source of 
information. Unlike print and other 
visual media, the Internet has no for
mal standards of integrity, nothing 
ensuring the information you receive is 
exact or even factual, whereas publish
ing a book requires years of research 
and editing.
Anyone can become a self-appointed
publisher on the Web with a few bucks 
and a modem. What the Web really needs 
is a good editor to weed out the garbage 
most people call a webpage.
Even if the information were precise, 
finding what you need is another matter. 
Everyday the Web reorganizes itself. Old 
sites disappear, and new ones take their 
place, meaning youre more likely to get 
the 404 Site not found than the 411.
Search engines arent helpful either. 
Try weeding out the data you need when 
your search engine returns 100,000 pos
sible sites. Youd have better luck with a 
Ouija board.
And the Internet, this mess, is the key 
to re-educating America or even revamp
ing American schools?
On the contrary, the problem with 
American education  the reason stu
dents dont learn  is not that the mate
rial is too dull or ethereal, but that weve 
relied too heavily on audio-visual meth
ods of instruction.
Educationis about interaction, notpassive sponging of the material through 
eyes or ears, yet the Internet requires no 
more interaction than a fewmouse clicks.
Indeed, the Internet is merely a demo
cratic version of television, where any
body can create his own channel, his own 
little temple to me-ism.
And like television, the Internet is about 
entertainment, not education.
So we shouldnt rush to network every 
school in America. If we do, we should 
just save the money on busing and build
ings and leave the kids at home to sit in 
front of the tube.
In the end, a disorganized network of 
computers will not end the dumbing 
of America, if such a cultural phenom
enon exists.
The Internet, at least in its current 
form, is not the panacea to American 
ignorance and educational apathy, but 
only makes the problem worse.
It just provides people with another 
astounding technological gizmo that 
prevents them from doing something 
more important with their time, namely 
thinking for themselves.

University should expand community service opportunities
________Michael Sperger
I heard once during an Admis
sions tour that in the olden days, 
every student at Carnegie Tech 
had to work shoveling coal into 
campus building furnaces for one 
semester before they were al
lowed to graduate. On some level 
Id like to believe that this was a 
precursor of sorts to the modem 
trend of service learning, 
through which college students 
are supposed to conduct service 
projects for course credit. Through 
service to others, the theory goes, 
we will grow as people and not 
just as employees.
Anne Shields, director of the 
Career Center, was kind enough 
to write me a note this week sug
gesting some reasons for students 
to get involved in community ser
vice, including the understand
ing that one person can make a 
difference, that service builds the 
personal character and skills that 
employers value and hire, that 
service can be paid work for stu
dents eligible for federal workstudy awards, and that service 
feels great! But Anne 
once gave me a much 
more compelling reason 
for pursuing service 
work: Your classes give 
you an education. Com
munity service gives you 
a life. Do you believe
all disciplines have shared in the 
experience. East End Tutoring 
has provided a great start to
ward creating a strong service 
learning program at CMU. But 
we would neglect our obvious 
potential for much greater 
achievements if we failed to exYour classes give you an 
education. Community 
service gives you a life. 
I have consistently observed that 
students here simply cannot 
wedge service work into their 
schedules. Deanna Rubin writes, 
There isnt much we can do to 
change the time commitment 
most people are willing and able 
to give to service projects. Why? 
Service work defies produc
tivity. Service work requires 
time. Servicework is human, 
something that requires 
heart as well as mind.
We must build more service learning courses be
cause we are not capable of in
volving a majority of people on 
this campus in community ser
vice without fitting it into an ex
pand on its success, 
that? Even ifyou do, how on earth We must build more servicewili you be able to fit another learning courses to expand our
time commitment into your community involvement. True,
schedules? Today University we have an extensive number of isting niche within students
Outreach offers the East End service groups and offerings on schedules. CMU students have a
campus. I should know  Im the 
Community Service intern for 
Student Life, and its my job to 
set up service trips open to all 
students and staff members. But
Tutoring Program just for this 
purpose. The program offers 
course credit for service work tu
toring elementary school kids, 
and hundreds of students from
strong scarcity mentality about 
their time.
Lets work with it instead of 
fighting it, and accomplish some 
things for this city while were at
it. Someone in Warner Hall has a 
vision for our future. They put it 
in a little display case in the el
evator, and its on the front page 
of our Website: Carnegie 
Mellon will lead educational in
stitutions by building on its tra
ditions of innovation and tran
scending disciplinary bound
aries to meet the changing needs 
of Society.
As CMU approaches its second 
century of existence, we have to 
ask for ourselves: Are we putting 
our money, our time, and our 
hearts where our mouth is?
Michael Sperger, a junior pro
fessional writing major,will be 
writing on a different aspect of 
campus life.
His topic for next week: Can we 
really cut loose and have fun at 
this place or not? Email responses 
by Wednesday night to 
sperg+forum@andrew.cmu.edu.
In an effort to prove that 
CMU students are, in fact, not 
as repressed as some people 
believe, we asked students:

led a sucessful life. They preserve their heritage, which reflects in 
Gryzwaczs competitive spirit and fiery temper.
I am more Americanized than Polish, but I always considered 
myself Polish, and Im very proud of that, said Grzywacz. The rookie 
has rallied under a different set of obstacles this year, never knowing 
what position hed play on any given night. A very versatile player 
with a perfected skating technique and soft hands, Grzywacz has 
moved from second line offense to third line defense, to first line 
defense, and finally to his present position back on second line 
offense. Its not unusual to see him go in and play some defensive 
shifts if need be and then jump right back into assisting on plays 
made by the second line. But it is his talkative nature, his encourage
ment, and communication on the ice that is invaluable. With two 
goals and six assists in his first season, his leadership will be 
important in future years on the club.
Paul Voulgaris is a European mix, born of a very interesting 
combination. His Czech mother, one of the first women engineers 
to come out of Eastern Europe, met his father when the two of them 
were learning English in New York. His father had immigrated 
from Greece, a place that Voulgariss family visits periodically and 
where Voulgaris, a junior architect major, will be staying as an 
intern this summer. It was his mother who started his familys love 
of hockey, for she had been brought up with it in her home town of 
Zilina, Czechoslovakia.
The area league has produced several NHL players, and Voulgariss 
mother brought her own enthusiasm for the sport to the U.S., 
teaching Paul to skate when he was four. Now, after three seasons, 
Voulgaris is a starting defenseman on a CMU club with a proven 
record of strong, clean defensive play as well as good offensive skills 
from its defenders. His heads-up style is exactly what the team needs 
in a defensive player, and he serves as a good model for the budding 
defensive unit on the team.
Carnegie Mellon brings people from all over the world together as a 
community. But we also have a microcosm of the NHL worldrightin our 
own backyard rink. The bond of love for hockey brings these people of 
diverse backgrounds together every week for six months of the school 
year, and the European contribution is not one to be overlooked.

Hockey playoff race heats up
From the Point
Jason Andracki
With just under 300 games remaining in this season, each one 
of them is going to be vital. If 
youve scanned the standings 
lately, you already know that this 
playoff race will be one of the 
tightest ever. Even perennial cel
lar dwellers like the New York 
Islanders and Hartford Whal
ers have a shot at a longer 
season than usual. The Mighty 
Ducks of Anaheim and the Ot
tawa Senators are also 
within reach of their first 
playoff berths.
In the Western 
Conference things 
are looking a little 
different. For 
once Detroit is 
neither perched 
atop the heap of 
the conference
nor atop the Central Division. 
Ive been skeptical of the Red 
Wings Stanley Cup chances for 
years, but I think this may be 
their year. They are not as over
rated as usual and theyve 
made some important . 
moves. In place of highly \ I 
touted, little producing 
players like Keith 
Primeau, the Wings have 
inserted the likes of 
spark plug Brendan 
Shanahan. Just 
last week,
Detroit
able to woo Mike Ramsey out of 
retirement for what could be a 
very successful post-season for 
them.
I think the desire to win can 
beat superior talent in the play
offs. Just look at the New 
Jersey Devils in1994and 
/ ? even the Rangers the 
' year before. Dont forget 
about the Florida Panthers 
last year either. This year 
I think the Penguins 
will be the team that,
was
although already deep in talent, 
will go even further based on their 
emotions. Its almost guaranteed 
that this will be Mario Lemieuxs 
final hurrah, so I think everyone 
in the organization wants 
Lemieux to leave the ice for the 
final time carrying the Cup. If 
the team manages to stay healthy 
they will be tough to knock out.
My completely off-the-wall, darkhorse prediction is that the team 
that signs Petr Klima will be in the 
finals. As of last week the freeagent winger had a tryout with the 
team he won the Cup with in 1990, 
the Oilers, and was being courted 
by the Dallas Stars. It would lj>e 
poetic justice if he is re-signed by 
the Red Wings, with whom ije 
began his career, and the 
Wings go on to defeat the 
Pens, who cut Klima ear
lier this year.

Womens team struggles
STRUGGLES, from page 12
They had us so rushed on of
fense. We lacked patience, said 
Coalter. Thats why we stayed 
within ten but couldnt get any
thing going.
With 9:07 left in the game a 
Becky McCadney basket brought 
the Tartans under ten points of 
Emory for the last time. Shortly
Lacey Peretta fouled out. Peretta 
had a game high five assists and 
her ball handling skills were im
portant in handling Emorys pres
sure defense. The opponents went 
on another 14-2 run to put the 
game away.
They took us out of our of
fense, Kupfer said. We were just 
throwing upshots and not runfterwards, freshman point guard ning our plays.
The team was outrebounded 
37-21, but outshoot Emory 46.7 
percent to 39.3 percent from the 
floor. Emory managed to put up 
16 more field goals than the Tar
tans and 18 more free throws.
The women play at Chatham 
tomorrow at 7 pm and Saturday, 
March 1 against the University 
of Rochester in Skibo Gymna
sium at 3 pm.Swim teams break records
CHAMPIONSHIPS, from page 12
fiers will be notified a week later. 
The top 16 swimmers in the na
tion from each event are invited. 
Coach Belowich also indicated 
that two women from the team 
have a good chance of making the 
trip.
Erin has a shot... I think maybe 
more so than Michelle, the coach 
said. Her time in the 100 would 
have made it last year. Kondos 
time would have been just short.
Division III championships are 
sponsored by Miami of Ohio, but 
held at the nearby College of 
Wooster. The womens champi
onships is March 15 and the men 
compete March 22.
The meets results bode well for 
the future for CMU.
All of the seniors did well, well 
miss them, but well be okay, 
said Belowich. All the women on 
the record breaking relay teams 
are freshmen and sophomores.
Our freshmen did most of our 
point scoring, said ORourke.
Womens top five scoring teams: 
Emory 870, John Hopskins 699, 
NYU 600, Washington Univer
sity 436, CMU 409. For the men: 
JH 1033, Emory 629, Wash. U. 
477.5, NYU 470, CMU 466 
A team that Ill remember for 
a long time, coach Belowich said.
Dave is a really great coach, I 
think he really cares about us a 
lot, said Skuly.
CMU falls short in basketball
HOOPS, from page 12
We received very good indi
vidual performances from Colin 
Shaunnessey, Scott Mills, and 
Kevin Cackovic, said Wingen. 
They played well off the bench. 
Shaunnessey led the Tartans 
with 21 points and five assists. 
Mills chipped in with 13 points
and Cackovic had 10.
The Tartans also received solid 
efforts from Sofish, with eight 
points and six rebounds, and 
sophomore Tommy Praesel, who 
finished with nine points and six 
rebounds.
Were scoring better (as com
pared to the beginning of the sea
son), but were having problems 
stopping people, said Wingen.
The Tartans conclude their 
regular season with a 7:30 game 
at Skibo Gym against Thiel Col
lege on Thursday night and a 
1:00 game against the University 
of Rochester at Skibo on Satur
day night.
Track gears up for UAAs
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
Last Friday nights track-and-field meet at 
Dennison University in Ohio proved to be a 
fruitful escapade full of record-breaking shotputs and impressive runs.
CMUs lean, mean women and men performed 
well in the shot-put, the 300 and 400 meter races, 
as well as the 3K, the pole vault, and the 4x400. 
Rosie Perez, a sophomore in MCS, placed second 
in shot-put and broke the school indoor record for 
her high-calibre performance.
The women have been very consistent this 
year, and it looks good for the conference meet 
this week, said coach Dario Donatelli. He also 
mentioned expressive performances by Alice 
Chong (sophomore, MCS), Jessica Connolly, and 
Kerry Riley, hurdler, also placed second at the 
meet. The sprinters are developing, said 
Donatelli, Riley is a good hurdler, along with 
Nakisha Pitter [a freshman in MCS]. We started 
off very strong with the distance people, and now 
the sprinters and hurdlers are catching up.
The UAA Championship, to be held this Friday 
at Brandeis University in Boston.
It wasnt a spectacular meet, said sprinter 
Dave Shafer (MCS freshman). I didnt have as 
much warm-up for the relays as I would have 
like.d I was just exhausted before my other two 
races. Practice and physical training for ROTC 
drained me. All was not negative, though. I 
should be nice and rested for this week, hope
fully, said Shafer.
The teams major beef was with the short 
warm-up time allotted and the order of the events. 
For example, the sprinters were sent off to run 
the 4x200,4x400, and 4x800, and then were sent 
into the hurdles and meter races, culminating
the 3K. While there is no doubt as to the teams 
stamina and endurance, the regimen was grueling.
Some mens team notables included Shafer in 
the 4x400 and the 300 and 400 meter races. Maliek 
Washington (sophomore, MCS) also performed well 
in the middle distances, and CIT junior Brian 
Ingram finished a strong 3K.
Junior Mech. E. major Rick Rikosky cleared 138.5" 
(unofficially) in the pole-vault, and the meet also 
featured a womens pole vault event, which neither 
the CMU women nor men competedin. The womens 
pole vault was a novelty this meet, and has not yet 
been accepted into a great number of competitions.
I felt good and I hope to do better at conference, 
said Riley. It felt nice to get a good race in before 
conference, because I Was worried about that. 
This Thursday, the teams are Boston-bound, 
which should be a treat for all involved. And, as the 
CMU track and field team is going strong, there 
will be no break in their positive streak.

The Super Bowl is over. That generially marks the end of the interesting 
sports season for a couple of months, 
until March Madness and the NBA and 
the Stanley Cup playoffs, right? That 
can hardly be further from the truth.
certain anymore, now that the Heat has 
completed the Riley construction period 
with the addition of Jamal Mashburn. 
Mashbum loves it in Miami, and the 
Heat is finally rid of all of their bench 
scrubs. This team is primed for the play
offs and gave the Bulls their only home 
loss this season. The Knicks are still 
lying in the weeds with a great deal of 
talent, but are probably not ready to 
make it to the finals until the Chicago 
era passes in a couple of years. But 
watch out; when Jordan, Pippin, Rod

City, the Knicks will begin their reign.
The Lakers are refusing to die without 
Shaq, as could be seen with their 16- 
point win over the Bulls. Elden Campbell 
is stepping it up big-time for the Lake 
Show. The Sonics are once again putting
Spring training recently began and the Pi
rates are carrying a modern-day record of 70 
players in camp. 
For all of you non-diehards out there, 
heres what youre missing.
Whats new in the NBA? The Bulls are 
pn top. Theyre going all the way again, 
right? Probably, but what was certain a 
jcouple of weeks ago might not be so
up a terrific regular season, but with 
only two wins against the Western 
Conferences big three (Lakers, Rockets, 
and Jazz), Seattle is primed for another 
playoff choke to a six or seven seed, 
perhaps the mighty Timberwolves.
Speaking of the TWolves, Tom Gugliotta 
is the man getting it done in Minnesota. 
When the duo of Stephon Marbury and 
Kevin Garnett really grow up, this team 
will be dangerous. Theyll make the play
offs this year, and they already have 
favorable records against the Rockets 
and the Sonics, so look for them as a 
sleeper team to make the second round 
of the playoffs.
Youve heard of the revolving door 
known as coaching changes in the 
NFL, but a team that didnt re
place their top man will prob
ably play the biggest role as 
a new Super Bowl con
tender next year. The Se
attle Seahawks, with the 
addition of ex-Steeler de
fenders Chad Brown 
and Willie Williams, 
have established one of 
the best pass rushes in 
the NFL with Brown 
joining Cortez 
Kennedy. Will
iams, who led the 
NFL in intercep
tions two years ago, 
will drasti
cally improve 
a Seattle sec
ondary that 
has
struggled. All of the weapons exist on 
offense except for quarterback, where 
John Friesz takes over the helm for 
now. With Rick Mirer gone to the Bears 
for a pick, Seattle might be interested 
in trading up to grab Peyton Manning. 
Regardless, Seattle will make the play
offs, and in the opinion of this nut, will 
make it to the Super Bowl if Dennis 
Erickson doesnt make the moronic 
coaching calls
Tony Yu/Tartan JuniorArt Staff
that hes accustomed to.
Finally, if you havent heard, spring 
training recently began and the Pi
rates are carrying a modern-day record 
of 70 players in camp. The Bucs new 
motto is probably similar to last years; 
except 110 percent is changed to 110 
losses. Look for drastic improvements 
from the Florida Marlins, who have 
picked up excellent leadership in 
former Pittsburgh skipper Jim 
Leyland and offensive firepower 
in Moises Alou and Bobby Bonilla. 
Also, the fish added an excellent 
starter in Alex Fernandez, to make 
the top three of Kevin Brown, A1 
Leiter, and Fernandez the best in 
the league behind the Braves. 
Dont look for the Marlins to 
overtake the Braves, yet. This 
team is only headed up, but 
probably to a wild card berth 
in the NL playoffs.
So late February shouldnt 
bring too much boredom in the 
sports world. If this doesnt 
excite you, you can always 
watch cars smash into each 
other in the wonderful world 
of NASCAR.

TV commentators add to games, most of the time
Lifes a Sport
Kevin Kroen
Next to the actual game itself, the 
thing that people notice most when they 
watch sporting events on TV are the 
announcers; the play-by-play guys, the 
color commentators, and the in-studio 
anchors. While some know their stuff 
and are fun to listen to, others are boring 
and not up-to-snuff.
Most Entertaining: By far, the four 
names that come to mind are Dick Vitale, 
Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Phil 
Rizzuto. Many people claim to get irri
tated by Vitales style, but he is one of 
the most knowledgeable college basket
ball announcers on TV. Some people
dont appreciate the depth of knowledge 
he possesses and his talent of expressing 
the this without putting people to sleep. 
Personally, I like the Hey, Baby! and 
Thats awesome with a capital A, no 
matter how many times he repeats them.
Bradshaw and Longhave helped to make 
FOX football what it is. When they 
initially got the contract to cover 
NFC football games, many people 
regarded it as a joke. But FOX soon 
became respected with its pre-game 
show. The dynamic duo of Terry 
and Howie provide experience and 
knowledge mixed with witty jokes 
and a load of enthusiasm.
Finally, there is Rizzuto. If youre 
not from New York, maybe youre 
not familiar with the long-time an
nouncer of the Yankees. The expres
sion Holy Cow! made this guy fa
mous, and he is one of the few announcers 
that makes watching baseball fun. He may 
be old and, but he keeps his audience 
entertained with jokes while providing in
sight from many years of experience.
Most Annoying: Two names come right 
tomindwhenyoumentionguysthatshould 
not be allowed on TV or near a microphone.
The first is Bill Walton. He should have 
never been allowed to do commentary for 
NBA games on NBC. Even worse, during 
beach volleyball duringthe Summer Olym
pics in Atlanta, he didnt have the slightest 
idea of what he was talking about. This guy 
is clueless, makes stupid comments about 
the smallest
Anthony Yu/Tartan Art Staff
events, and never seems to be able to inter
pret what is currently going on in a basket
ball game. He also has an annoying ten
dency to treat every play as if it is a life-ordeath situation.
The other guy is Clark Kellog. He does 
college basketball games for ESPN and
CBS, and does in-studio commentary for 
the NCAA tournament. All you have to do 
is watch this guy once and youll be ready 
to take a gun and put it to his head. He 
uses metaphors that make no sense, makes 
the stupidest jokes, and his commentaries 
never seem to be saying anything new. He 
has a way of talking on and on without any 
purpose whatsoever.
Best Overall: Four guys who come 
to mind as the best sports personalities 
on TV are Bob Costas, Chris Berman, 
John Saunders, and Marv Albert. Costas 
is perhaps the best sports personality 
on TV right now. Hes smooth, ener
getic, smart (especially when it comes 
to baseball), and always seem to have 
a sense of the moment. I still remem
ber commentaries he made during 
the Olympics and the NBAFinals; he 
couldnt have be more exact with 
what was going on.
Berman is a guy who came from noth
ing to become one of the most energetic 
and exciting announcers on TV. In stu
dio work and play-by-play for ESPN and 
ABC, he combines a strong knowledge of 
several sports with an entertaining per
sonality. I think Ill always remember
his line Oh my God, hes done it again 
line, referring to the home run Cal Ripken 
hit in the game that broke Lou Gehrigs 
consecutive game streak.
Most people wouldnt group Saunders 
into this category, but hes become one 
the best in-studio sports anchors on TV; 
There is no glamour or humor here, but 
Saunders gives it to you straight and to 
the point. He rarely makes errors, and 
when he has to be funny, he is. His 
halftime report with Digger Phelps on 
ESPN has become a trademark in col
lege basketball, and has broadened his 
horizons with college football for ABC.
Finally, there is Marv Albert. Take a 
look at any recent NBA finals highlight 
video (and quite a few video games) and 
youll hear MaiVs voice on the play-byplay. What NBA fan can forget his fa
mous line, Another spectacular move 
by Michael Jordan, from the 1991 NBA 
finals when the Chicago Bulls beat the 
Los Angeles Lakers. He provides consis
tency and excitement. It wouldnt be the 
NBA on NBC without Albert.
Kevin Kroen is a freshman undeclared 
humanities and social sciences major. Europeans play on team
By JESSICA STEELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Some criticize European hockey play
ers  say that theyre dirty, turtle when 
challenged to fight, and skate too fancy. 
But usually these are words of jealousy. 
We are mesmerized by the way Euro
pean players play, they skate fluidly, 
handle the puck like its a goose feather 
taped to their blade. We fear what we do 
not understand. The same is true for 
many opponents of CMU in the WPCHA 
when they see last names on the roster 
like Ivanovic, Voulgaris, and Grzywacz. 
CMU club hockey is comprised of a pano
ply of backgrounds and styles, but no 
group stands out like the Europeans.
Nowthatterm is loose. Senior forward 
ielja Ivanovic was bom in Belgrade, 
Jugoslavia and came to the U.S. when 
le was 19 to attend college in Boston. 
?reshman forward Przemyslaw (PJ) 
Jrzywaczs family came over from his 
lative home of Poland when he was five. 
Paul Voulgariss mother is Czechoslovadan and his father is from Greece, but 
he was actually bom in the U.S. and 
learned Greek in school. All different, 
but bound by a team and a similar man
lier of play.
Watch them skate. Ivanovics legs slice 
into the ice as he powers past defenders, 
making playslookso pretty youd swear 
he was Jagr. Sometimes its too much
he tries for the backhand when the rest 
of the net is open  but its always 
exciting. He knows this game. He played 
with the big boys in Yugoslavia, and if he 
hadnt suffered a severe concussion when 
he was 14, would have gone on the fol
lowing year to sign a professional con
tract for hockey. But he was forbidden to 
play hockey, and didnt lace on a pair of 
skates for seven years after his accident.
For the first three years after they 
told me that I couldnt play, whenever I 
saw hockey on TV I would shake, 
Ivanovic said. He fed his withdrawl 
symptoms with another love, computer 
science. After a year of college in Yugo
slavia, he got a student visa to study in 
Boston. Two years later he transfered to 
CMU, because its the best, he says 
with anon-chalant smile. But his hockey 
career here has not been uneventful. 
After finally being medically cleared to 
play in his first semester at CMU, he has 
tom up the ice to become one of the 
teams leading scorers; this season scor
ing 11 goals and adding nine assists.
Getting to the U.S. was rough for 
Przemyslaw Grzywaczs family. Inl982, 
the family left Poland for Austria when 
Poland had fallen on dark days. With 
food shortages and unrest, it was no 
place to raise a family. But since the 
family came to their current home in 
Downingtown, Pennsylvania, they have

Tempers flare during, after game
TEMPERS, from page 12
the key to the game, said 
defenseman Dave Mitzel.
But the go-ahead goal was not 
enough. For the second straight 
year, a Pitt player sent 
Maddalena sprawling hard into 
the far boards. Last year they 
destroyed his shoulder; this year, 
it was his head. After being down 
for some minutes, Maddalena left 
the ice assisted by two EMTs. He 
complained of intense pain to the 
back of his head.
Pitt showed no sportsmanship in 
this incident. They did not show any 
respect when Maddalena was down 
on the ice, not cheeringhim (as is the 
norm) whenherose from the ice. The 
Pitt coaches were visibly laughing 
about the fallen player as their play
ers clustered to the away bench.
; These hatchet men werent 
done yet. The game ended and 
CMU went to shake hands. But 
Pitts Elliot, who had been an
tagonizing the fans the entire 
game by childishly slamming his 
stick against the home section 
glass, wasnt in the receiving line. 
The referees report to the com
missioner reads that Pitt players 
were over by the fan-side boards 
when shouting and stick-waving 
drew them to the scene. They 
removed the Pitt players, but not 
before Pitts Wills slashed his 
stick on the bare arm of a CMU 
fan. This incited the fans to rush 
towards the crowd of Pitt players 
as they came off the ice.
A melee ensued, and Pitt was 
escorted back onto the ice. But 
Elliot could not be restrained. He 
busted past his coach and ran in 
his skates into the lobby, to con
tinue going after the CMU fans. 
Same old situation, different se
mester; he loses control at every 
Pitt/CMU game. The referees were 
too busy trying to control the crowd 
to bother with off-ice incidents,
andElliot was notpenalized. Wills 
was given a game misconduct for 
his total lack of sportsmanship, 
and although his actions are seen 
by law as assault with a weapon, 
no charges have been filed.
Police had to be called in with 
dogs to clear the rink and ques
tion players and fans on the inci
dent. The referees blamed the 
entire situation on lack of secu
rity at the rink.
Regardless of the ending, the 
two best teams in our division 
played a one-goal game, Coach 
Maddalena said. ccWe should have 
won it. The team played tough. 
Hopefully well the get the chance 
tobeattheminthe championship.
CMU ends their regular season
11-81. They play IUP in the 
first round of the playoffs Friday 
night. If they advance in the single 
elimination tournament, they will 
face undefeated Penn State Main 
on Saturday night.

Women and men both place fifth at IIAA championships
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
When you get a meet like this, it dont matter 
what the score was, said mens and womens 
swimming head coach David Belowich. And thats 
not rationalizing at all. The teams swam at their 
conference championships this weekend. Every
body had at least one [personal] best time, most 
everybody had all best times.
Chris ORourke, in his last meet, had his best 
times in the 50, 100, ... and in all his split [relay] 
times, said Belowich.
Everyone was swimming fast, it was kinda 
contagious, said ORourke. The senior captain, 
like many other swimmers, was disappointed with 
the mens team performance, but please with indi
vidual results.
The team coming in fifth place was pretty disap
pointing, said Jake McGuire, a junior. Next year 
well get second.
The men were just 11.5 points back from the 
third place team. I think the conference is cer
tainly getting faster, ORouke said. [But] we have 
a better team this year than we did last year. 
They worked real hard this year and they got 
rewarded for that this week, Belowich said.
The team left for Rochester University this past 
Tuesday, in order to give them plenty of time for 
the for three days of competition in New York.
We were all really relaxed going into the meet,

CMUs womens basketball 
team took a hard loss last Friday, 
6850 at Emory University.
We played good defense, but it 
was our offense that prevented 
us from winning, said senior 
guard Tracy Coalter, who finished 
with 12 points, all on three-point 
shots. They were deliberate with 
their offense. We were not.
The women started the game 
well, jumping up 6-4 in the early 
going. But Emory outscored the 
Tartans 14-2 over the next five 
minutes to take an 18-8 lead, 
and the gap between the two 
teams remained at least ten 
points for most of the rest of the 
game. The team lost freshman 
Sam Majernik early in the game 
to an ankle injury. Majernik, who 
is usually a strong source of scor
ing off the bench, started, but 
played only seven minutes before 
her injury.
Off a Marcelle Stelle basket, the 
Tartans got as close as seven with 
five minutes left before halftime, 
but were held to one field goal for 
the rest of the opening half. CMU
was hurt in the first half by their 
19 turnovers and committed a to
tal of 28 for the game. 18 of the 
turnovers were products of Emory 
steals. Junior Katie OLeary had 
a good first half with 6 points on 3 
of 3 shooting.
Coalter would keep the Tartans 
close with three three-pointers at 
the start of the second half. But
CMU was never able to put to
gether a consistant run at Emory.
Everytime we made a little 
effort [to get back into the 
game], they came right back 
and kept holding us off, said 
senior Kristen Kupfer, who led 
the team with 14 points and 
seven rebounds.
Please see STRUGGLES page 10
PaigeAngstadt. Of course there were awesome 
swims, but that there were other sources of fun, 
such as doing cheers before the races. Teambonding type things.
Its something that a lot of people dont under
stand, said Belowich. We have a whole group of 
people striving to achieve the same goal and then 
you achieving it... The coach trailed off and smiled 
in remembrance of the week.
It was really exciting swimming that fast and 
seeing the other girls break the records. A lot of 
those record had Becky in them, said Angstadt, 
referring to last years star swimmer Rebecca 
Fruehan.
The women broke five school records, three on 
relays. 200 medley and 400 medley relays consist
ing of, Skuly, Erin Rockwell, Melissa Sloan, KaraSlow start does in mens hoop team
Cook, set a new mark. Michelle Kondo, Skuly, 
Rockwell, and Cook broke the old record in the 800 
free. Records also fell in the 100. backstroke, to 
Skuly and the 100 breastroke, to Rockwell.
We did really fantastic, said Skuly.
Jake McGuire broke his own school record in the 
50 free, [he] missed the 100 fly by a hundreth of a 
second, said Belowich. Of all the men, McGuire 
has the best shot for qualifying for the Division III 
national championships.
Id say my best shot is in the 100 freestyle, he 
said. McGuire came from behind in the last turn to 
become the UAA champion in the 100 freestyle by 
0.02 seconds.

The CMU mens basketball 
team used a late rally but couldnt 
topple Emory, as the Eagles de
feated the Tartans 82-76 in At
lanta on Friday night.
CMU came out sluggish once 
again, falling down a quick 11-0. 
Gary Trendel took a hard fall 
during the opening minutes and 
missed the rest of the game with 
a concussion.
You cant just spot a team 11 
points like that, said junior Colin 
Shaunnessey. Shaunnessey was 
forced to take over the center 
position after Trendel exited the 
game. We were getting killed on 
the glass.
We were settling for jump 
shots, and that really contrib
uted to their good start, said 
coach Tony Wingen.
After the slow start, the Tar
tans began to run with the ball 
and crept back into the game, 
cutting the lead to 28-26 late in 
the first half. Emory led CMU by 
four at the half, 36-32, with CMU
getting solid efforts off the bench 
from Shaunnessey and sopho
more Scott Mills, who led the 
team with nine points at halftime.
We seemed to be playing in 
spurts, said junior Andy Sofish.
The Tartans came out strong 
once again at the start of the 
second half, eventually tying the 
score at 40 off consecutive 
Shaunnessey field goals. But 
Emorys quickness and aggres
siveness helped them push the 
lead back out to 11.
Theyjust beat us to every loose 
ball and rebound, said Wingen.
However, just as it seemed that 
CMU was out of it, they roared 
back to make it exciting in the 
end. CMU received two critical 
three-pointers from Sofish and 
senior Kevin Cackovic to cut the 
lead to 80-76. The Tartans were 
taking advantage of poor foulshooting by the Eagles to cut into 
their lead. Unfortunately, the 
Tartans would get no closer than 
four points to Emory, who even
tually iced the game with late 
freethrows.

Face to Face...

Saturday afternoon. Jander scored two goals for CMU, including the game winner.
unris cannon/1 artan sports bditor 
Junior Jay Miolla tries to take the ball from a Duquesne player in a scrimmage at 
Gesling stadium. CMU rallied from an 0-2 deficit to win 4-3.
This is what my high school coach 
called bush league hockey, when there 
are lots of fights, said starting 
goaltender Jon Kliegman about 
Carnegie Mellon club hockeys Satur
day night loss to the University of Pitts
burgh. He was referring to the 54 pen
alty minutes assessed (only 16 of which 
were CMUs), the confrontation in the 
stands between fans, and the brawl 
between Pitt players and fans as they 
left the ice. The police had to clear the 
building after the disheartening 4r-3 
loss, but CMU was more than willing to 
go home.
Pitt got the first two goals early in the 
first and second, the second one being a 
powerplay shot. But CMU was playing a 
tight, tough game all around. The first 
line of captain Roger Maddalena, senior 
Ray Ardire, and junior Scott Fitzgerald 
pressured the big Bill Elliot line of Pitt. 
They have all been here before. Both 
teams knew exactly who would produce. 
So CMU mixed it up a bit.
It was CMUs second line of freshman 
PJ Grzywacz and seniors Relj a Ivanovic 
and Anthony Paul that provided im
portant offense for CMU. Grzywacz 
cleared the lanes with smart checks, 
backed up his teammates, and man
aged to take a feed from Ivanovic and 
throw the puck to his 
winger Paul. Paul then 
dug in to score on the 
power play, five min
utes into the second.
Pitt answered two min
utes later to make the
score an unbearable 3 ___________
1 as they left the ice B** 
after the close of the second. They knew 
that something had to change, the fire 
had to be stoked.
Fans cant win a game, but the combi
nation of skating out for warm-ups in 
the third period to a bagpiper piping 
mightily and stands filled with boister
ous CMU supporters helped boost 
morale tenfold.
The bagpiper made it like

Braveheart. It was the loudest game 
that Ive heard in my six years here at 
CMU, said defenseman Blair Echols.
Fanning the fire helped; Pitt took a 
penalty and again CMU was on the 
prowl. Defenseman Paul Voulgaris 
found Ardire, who took the puck around 
the Pitt net and drew three players on 
him as they anticipated a shot. But it

in my six years here at CMU. 
 defenseman Blair Echols
was Fitzgerald sitting in front who re
ceived the puck from Ardire and scored 
on a slapshot that barely skirted over 
the goalies pad.
The crowd went ballistic. They taunted 
Elliot, teased the opposing fans, and 
they rattled the goalie. For a minute it 
seemed to work. Pitt took a time out and 
the piper started his revelry again, blar
ing over the stomping feet of the crowd.
Pitt had been hitting high all night and 
finally got called for it. CMU found 
themselves with perfect opportunity, 
with the crowd still roaring. The second 
line came out in the second minute of 
the advantage; Paul controlled the disk 
and sent to Ivanovic, who spied 
Grzywacz on top of the right face-off 
circle. Grzywacz took the long shot and 
it flew past the Pitt 
goaltender. CMU had 
tied the game 3-3 
with 11 minutes left, 
and the bench ex
ploded in jubilation 
over the rookies goal. 
But fear brings out 
t iii Mjij the WOrst in players. 
Pitt played the rest of the game like 
goons. They went out with intent to 
injure, hacking at CMU players heads 
and necks. On the resulting powerplay, 
with six minutes left in the contest, Pitt 
scored what would prove to be the gamewinner.
They scored three of their four goals 
on the powerplay. Obviously, that was

Living with HIV and
Actor sho
By DANIELLE PIERATTI
Tartan Staffwriter
We teach what we need to learn, said ScottiFried, 
quoting words that he has lived by since his involve
ment in HIV and AIDS awareness educatioii began 
in 1992. Fried, who is HIV-positive, has traveled 
around the country giving various talks on the 
subject, and has used his profession as an actor to 
further the cause. He has appeared on the daytime 
soap opera Guiding Light as Bart, a character 
living with HIV.
It was great because I was playing an HIVpositive character, so I was playing who I am. Video, 
TV, and theater can really distort things, but with 
the best of intentions. As an actor living with HIV, I 
have a responsibility not to distort the truth because 
the media so often does, said Fried.
This commitment to the truth is the motive for 
the numerous road trips and talks all over the 
country to which Fried has devoted a majority of 
his time since 1992, five years after he found out 
he was HIV positive.
I was going to support groups and meetings and 
I got tired of going after four or five years, so I 
decided I needed something else to keep me involved 
in the community and my own healing process, 
rather than sitting and just talking about my feel
ings. I thought I would teach about them instead, 
said Fried about his choice to go on the road.
This week, Frieds travels will start at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. It is one of many stops he will 
make at college and high school campuses to inform 
students about the realities of HIV and AIDS. He 
also visits junior high schools, grade schools, youth
optimism
groups, and any place that offers the prospect of 
guiding young minds away from the dangers of HIV.
; Fried has been involved in a group in New 
York City called T.H.E J|Teen HIV Educators) 
Group, of which he was abounding member. It 
was a great group of kids that I started out with 
0n Staten Island, Fried said of the handful of 
young people that were part of the intimate 
group.
Anything that is now a part of my routine I 
started ... with them. I really used them as guinea 
pigs. I helped to teach them how to teach about 
AIDS, said Fried, who eventually moved on from 
the group. Its different when you have 20 kids 
working with you. Its a lot of work when youre on 
your own. Theyre great kids. A lot of them Im still 
in touch with, he said.
He has also worked with mentally retarded stu
dents. Id love to work with more disabled people, but 
you know I need to go where the work is, said Fried.
One of the biggest misconceptions about people 
who are HIV positive is that were victims, Fried 
said, referring to the medias role in fostering a 
view of HIV and AIDS that is distorted. They want 
to make us out to be [pitiful]. Theyre trying to 
make me different from you. He contracted HIV in 
December 1987 when he had sex for the first time 
and did not use protection.
Fried emphasized that his trips to speaking 
venues were not too much for him, and instead 
opted to bring out the fact that at times his busy 
schedule would be difficult for anyone, HlV-positive or not.
One of the great things about HIV is that its an

Group seeks to train AIDS educators at CMU
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
There is a lot of apathy on this campus about things in general. Its important to address 
this issue, said Kelly McPhee, a sophomore psychology major. The issue in question? AIDS 
and HTV awareness in the CMU community.
McPhee is the group coordinator and founder of AdvocAIDS, an organization 
dedicated to AIDS education and awareness. Formed two semesters ago, the group 
is seeking to train and certify HIV educators. AIDS has killed so many people and
has the potential to 
kill so many more, 
said AdvocAIDS 
member Vince Broz, 
a freshman computer 
science major.
It is imp ortant that 
someone makes an ef
fort to educate people 
about the issues in
volved in HIV, said
We want people to empathize with 
HIV positive people and those who 
know people who [have AIDS].
 Kelly McPhee, 
founder of AdvocAIDS
McPhee. McPhee feels that apathy and a general lack of experience make CMU 
students unaware and especially at risk of HIV. Ive been interested in this for a 
while, said McPhee. Its a social responsibility. A lot of HIV-related topics arent 
talked about by a lot of people, and I wanted to change that.
The group met three times in the past semester. The first meeting, a lot of people came. 
The second meeting, a lot less people came, and the last meeting, there was only Vince [Broz]. 
People tell me that the meeting time is difficult, and since its second semester, people

Ten facts about HIV and AIDS
 HIV is spread through the exchange of blood, semen, vaginal fluids, 
breast milk, or through vertical transmission during pregnancy 
(mother-to-child).
 ANYONE can contract HIV.
 AIDS is usually fatal.
 The best way to avoid contracting HIV is to practice abstinence and avoid 
drugs.
 The best way to avoid contracting HIV through sex is to: limit the number 
of sexual partners, use latex condoms with Nonoxynol-9 every time
you have intercourse, practice monogamy with your partner, and avoid 
sex when you are under the influence of alcohol.
 HIV can be contracted through the use of IV drugs.
 HIV transmission is most risky during anal sex; oral sex is the least risky.
 HIV does not spread through contact with unbroken skin.
 Anyone who has ever engaged in sexual intercourse or has used drugs 
should consider getting tested for HIV.
 Only 50 percent of HIV-infected people show symptoms within seven 
years of contracting HIV; many spread the virus without knowing it.

Columinst questions race in conservatory1!
Facing Race and Culture
by Shannon Gibney
Theater should be an ex
ample of the diverse and dy
namic society we live in, said 
Ben Valenciano, a junior drama 
major who is also Filipino 
American. But with an average 
of six ethnic minority students 
per class, a few mi
nority faculty 
members and a 
handful of Afri
can American
and Latino plays produced in its entire history, 
it seems that CMUs drama conservatory, a 
nationally high-ranking program, has a long 
way to go to achieve this vision.
Almost 12 percent of all undergrads in the 
drama department are African American or 
Latino. This is well above the University-wide 
average of 8.7 percent. Everybody [at CMU] 
points to us as the leading department in this 
area, in terms of faculty, students and what we do, said Peter 
Frisch, head of the Drama department. And yet, when I hear 
this it makes me sad because representation is so low at this 
university. Were still behind, though were pointed to as an 
example, said Frisch.
Frisch added that the department now actively seeks out and 
recruits strong minority candidates by traveling to areas like Miami 
and Los Angeles which have strong ethnic representation, as well as 
working with admissions to offer scholarships to students from these 
groups who have financial need.
The way things are in the world now, its not economically 
feasible for a lot of black people to enter this kind of program.
2In formatois
Also, arts are not a priority in many homes, said Michelei 
Zugschwerdt, a multiracial senior production major. I dont| 
think any of this is the departments fault  funding for thej 
arts is being cut all over the U.S.
Dondre Greenhouse, a senior acting/musical theater major 
who is African-American, believes that hiring more faculty 
members who are ethnic minorities would attract more students 
from these groups, help keep those already in the department 
from leaving, and enhance the quality and depth of educa
tion for all drama students.
Being a musical theater major, I have one

Students should be well-versed
The Players Manual
by Amit N. Kar
Two winters ago, my father had to 
leave the company he had been working 
with for 29 years and join another one so 
he could continue his overseas posting. 
This was particularly upsetting for him; 
he had been looking forward to reaching 
the 30-year mark ever since his 25-year 
mark. His sense of loyalty was frus
trated by economic realities.
You and I wont have this problem  
economic realities will ensure we wont 
have time to develop a sense of loyalty. 
According to the pundits, were the gen
eration who will have to completely 
change careers, on average, three times 
during our working lives. That means 
well have to periodically forget about 
whatever weve been doing with our
selves for x-amount of years, learn a 
new skill, and learn it well enough for 
' someone to willingly pay us to practice 
. it. This wont be an easy thing to do, 
especially if you spend your formative 
, years focusing on a narrow set of skills 
! or knowledge. You can prepare yourself 
for the inevitable now.
There are benefits to being a wellrounded person because this can help 
; you in the changing global work culture. 
There are two approaches to well-roundedness. The first involves stuffing your 
job as often as possible in the hope that 
your resulting bulk will scare people 
from interrupting your train of thought.
The second simply involves learning as 
many different skills as you can right 
now, while you still have the time and 
energy. This latter approach is less tax
ing on your heart.
An individual who has developed a 
broad base of skills and knowledge, even 
if only to an intermediate level, has sev
eral advantages over someone who hasnt 
made a similar effort. First of all, a bal
anced person has already demonstrated 
that he or she not only has the ability to 
tackle a wide variety of disciplines, but
Secondly, a balanced person will learn 
something new faster than a narrowlyeducated person, issues of latent talent 
notwithstanding. Think about the very 
definition of creativity  the blending of 
fields of knowledge in a new or novel way
 the greater your fields of knowledge, 
the more creative you will be. In the same 
fashion, a person with a vast array of 
skills and interests can draw upon that 
arsenal when learning a new skill or 
mastering a new system of knowledge. 
There is another less obvious ad
vantage that balanced 
people have and it has noth
ing do with careers. I have 
always maintained that be
yond career and success, be
yond money and material 
wealth, beyond achieving 
superiority and acknowl
edgment, living is about the 
people who surround you 
and exploring your relation
ships with them. If you are 
willing and able to try a wide 
variety of activities, you 
have connections with a 
greater number of people 
than someone who has lim
ited him or herself.
So, if you intend to keep the 
bigger picture in mind, you 
wont let some assinine prob
lem set, case study, or com
puter program keep you from 
your squash match, poetry 
reading, D&D game, jam ses
sion, darkroom time ...
Amit knows his grades
also the sincere interest to do so. It should 
be perfectly clear to anyone who has 
interviewed with recruiters that they are 
not only interested in whether or not you 
are able to do the job, but also why.

Students support 
AIDS awareness
SUPPORT, from page LI
are already into things and dont want 
to start other things, said McPhee.
The group is preparing to work with 
the Pittsburgh AIDS Task force (PAT) 
in an effort to certify members as HIV 
educators who will then be a valuable 
resource on campus. The certification 
course is a three to four hour workshop 
that allows volunteers to be considered 
officially sanctioned AIDS educators. 
McPhee and members of the group 
hope to become certified, and to invite 
all new members to become certified.
PAT is a major force in the Pitts
burgh area. The group provides case 
management, advocacy, legal services, 
and facilitates transportation and per
sonal care for AIDS patients. The group 
also offers confidential HTV testing 
and counseling.
McPhee hopes to make AdvocAIDS 
an active partner with PAT. They 
are also meeting with Anita Barkin, 
director of Health Services, and Jeff 
Lauzon of Health Services to plan 
further activities. So far Jeff has 
given me a lot of good advice. I also 
worked with Brian Curfman (a se
nior psychology major) who organized 
World AIDS day last semester, and 
[I am] in general trying to contact as 
many people as possible. We are try
ing to bring on members who can 
reach a lot of people.
We are looking for anyone with 
an open mind and who cares about 
the issue, said McPhee. You have 
to be open to talk about every aspect 
of the disease.
McPhee is planning an AIDS rally 
next September in conjunction with a
an AIDS awareness week for incoming 
and returning students.
The commitment to the organiza
tion is basically to answer HTV ques
tions and be present on campus a 
someone who is educated about HIV, 
said McPhee.
Its a really rewarding experience 
because you are saving peoples lives, 
said member Anne Clarke, sophomore 
in communications design. AdvocAIDS 
stresses, is the key to safety and good 
health.
We are planning to increase aware
ness on campus through monthly 
posterings. Theyll have a basic fact 
about HIV, or advertise the PAT work
shops or speakers.... We want people 
to empathize with HIV positive people 
and those who know people who have 
died from AIDS. Our goal is to edu
cate, said McPhee.
AdvocAIDS meets on Wednesdays at 
6:30 pm in the West Wing TV Room. The 
next meeting is this Wednesday, Febru
ary 26. AdvocAIDS invites any inter
ested student to come by and talk for 
bit. In order to reach as many people a 
possible, McPhee and the group als 
encourage any interested student to con
tact them and schedule a personal meet
ing to discuss ways to help.

Design firm gives local restaurants national recognition
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
Pittsburgh and opportunity.
Lately, these two words have become synony
mous, as filmmakers and young entrepreneurs 
have taken advantage of the people and resources 
the city has to offer. This was the case for Bernard 
Uy and James Nesbitt, recent alumni of CMU, who 
founded Wall-to-Wall Studios, a progressive de
sign and marketing firm, five years ago.
Recently, two more young businessmen have 
taken advantage of the entrepreneuring oppor
tunities Pittsburgh has to offer. Tom Baron and 
Juno Yoon, two residents of New York, began 
Big Burrito, a company that includes a chain of 
upscale restaurants. A recent issue of the Wall 
Street Journal featured an article about the 
success of the chains restaurants, pointing out 
that Baron and Yoon have brought the city 
nightlife atmosphere of New York to Pittsburgh. 
The chain includes six contemporary restau
rants  Casbah, Mr. Jones, Kaya, Vertigo Bar, 
Soba, and Mad Mex. Wall-to-Wall has basically 
done all the corporate identity designing and 
advertising for each of these restaurants.
Both Uy, a computer science and graphic 
design major who graduated from CMU in 1990, 
and Nesbitt, a fine arts major who graduated 
in 1991, left Pittsburgh after graduation to 
pursue their careers, but soon returned to Pitts
burgh to start their own business. According to
Mimiimjr \suavj/ lanan niuiu
Mad Mex restaurant was recently mentioned in The Wall Street Journal for its profitable business.
Uy, their type of progressive designing and 
marketing work was already popular in cities 
such as Boston and San Francisco, so they 
figured there would be greater opportunity for 
them in Pittsburgh.
[While working in larger firms, I] was learn
ing a lot, but wanted to do something fun,
said Uy. Thus, he and Nesbitt decided to go 
into business together, and in 1992, began 
Wall-to-Wall Studios.
Mad Mex was one of the first big Wall-to-Wall 
clients, right after Bernard and James started 
their business, said Mike Lemme, a senior com
munication design major who worked full-time
at Wall-to-Wall for a year and currently works 
there part-time. I think it was really a perfect fit 
and they were all pretty lucky to find each other. 
Tom and Juno came to Pittsburgh to bring some
thing completely new to the restaurant scene 
and [Uy] and [Nesbitt] decided to start their 
business here to bring something completely 
new to the design scene.
[We] took a gamble by going that route to wori 
with restaurants, which wasnt the biggest 
moneymaking opportunity, but we saw it as a 
chance to do some hip and funky work, said Uy. 
Their collaboration has led Wall-to-Wall to pro
duce successful design schemes for all the 
Burrito restaurants. [The restaurants] needed tq 
be a little more progressive-looking, said Uy, 
Wall-to-Wall told them to add a little humor to 
their advertising and more twists to their menu 
items. They have created the logos, designed thetshirts and matchbooks, written and designed the 
print ads, thought up slogans, and recently createij 
the first television advertisement for the restau
rants. The firm is also currently working on a Web 
site for Big Burrito.
Amanda Talbott, a senior communication 
major and former intern at Wall-to-Wall, said, [The 
progressive designing] offers a little more character 
to the places. [Items] such as the menus with twist* 
of humor interact more with the user and make the 
user more comfortable with the place. Everything 
works togetherthe design... the atmosphere,

CMU drama lacks 
minority students
DRAMA, from page L2
who is Puerto Rican-American, said, I feel pretty supported as an 
actor. Theres a neutral base that they [the drama faculty] work from, 
so I dont feel neglected in terms of my acting training. Frisch said that 
this neutral base includes Greek, Elizabethan, and Restoration drama, 
and that training in these areas is considered foundational for all actors 
in the conservatory.
I havent seen or touched a play by a Latin American playwright since Ive 
been here. I think its an important body of work, but at the same time, theyre 
so busy training us as actors that there is no time to stray from this neutral 
base, said Rivera.
Laschanda DeVuaghn, an African-American senior acting major, said
I feel that we get... type-cast, and I think 
thats because we dont have faculty who 
understand our position as black actors. 
 senior Dondre Greenhouse
that this focus on traditional casting within the department and 
departments lack of support for minority students forced her to face the 
harsh realities of show business. I think minorities benefit from being 
in the drama department more than other students because we were 
shut-down early, so we have strengthened. Thats the way the business 
is, so I think Im more prepared than some of my counterparts, she said.
However, Devaughn added, Usually the people who end up having the most 
consistent work are minorities, because there is a big demand for us. So I think the 
department should accept more minority students, to accommodate this demand.
In regards to whether the Drama department does enough to represent 
the experiences of ethnic minorities, Thom Douglas, lecturer in voice, said, 
Do we [the faculty and administration] do shows that require minority 
casting in the majority of principal roles? I would say no, I dont think so, but 
then again, are there enough students of any minority group to support a 
production like this? As things stand now, there are not enough students 
in each class to produce a full-length play by an ethnic minority playwright 
in the Kresge Theater.
In the end, the question comes down to who will lead the way in increasing 
representationfaculty or students? Does one have to come before the other? 
In a sense, I think faculty members have to lead the way, said Frisch. If you 
have a class of 30 students, three of whom are minorities, how can you function 
without addressing some of these issues, some of the work from people in these 
groups? Im talking in terms of knowledge, not just interest, he said.
It will be interesting to see how the department, its faculty, and its 
productions face or do not face the challenges of ethnic representation in the 
face of decreasing funding for the arts. The profound shift in the demographics 
of race and ethnicity occurring nationwide may force the department to be as 
daring and demanding in its ethnic representation as it is in its art.

Actor dispels HIV stereotypes

equalizer. It makes us realize that 
were all human because anyone 
can contract it. There are no such 
things as risk groups  there is 
only risk behavior. The only risk 
group there can possibly be is if 
youre someone who thinks it cant 
happen to you. Then youre at risk, 
said Fried.
His opinion that HIV can have 
positive effects only furthers his 
attempts at dispelling the miscon
ceptions that arise so easily among 
those who do not come in contact 
with the disease.
I know a lot of my friends who 
are infected have restored or cre
ated or developed a sense of spiri
tuality or relationship with God 
because the prospect of dying 
young can do that to you. We

we find God if we need him. I

comforted by that process, said 
Fried.
Another positive aspect of his 
illness, according to Fried, is his 
communication with students. 
Theres something wonderful 
that happens when a group of 
students comes together on their 
own behalf to learn how to live 
their lives. Its an experience that 
I dont want anybody to miss out 
on, said Fried.
Another misconception is that 
everyone who has HIV just wants 
to die. Its not just about the trag
edy in our lives. Look for the bless
ings, said Fried. Its a mixed 
bag of challenges, devastations, 
but also blessings, he said.
His talk this week will be on 
Wednesday, February 26, at 8 
pm in the William Pitt Union, 
Kurtzman Room, University of 
Pittsburgh. In addition, Fried 
would like to invite students to

the excellent food.
The work has undoubtedly played a 
role in the continued success of the 
restaurant and has provided great ex
posure for the young design firm, 
Lemme said.
The Wall-to-Wall design studio is 
an example of how successful Pitts
burgh entrepreneurs are aiming to 
keep Pittsburgh graduates in Pitts
burgh. Wall-to-Wall is mainly com
prised of CMU graduates and cur
rent students who work either parttime or full-time.
The experience has been better than 
I could have planned. Ive been able to 
work on a lot of cool projects, and 
because its a small firm, Ive had a lot 
more responsibility and control than I 
would have had in a larger firm, said 
Lemme. As Uy currently is an adjunct 
professor in the Design department 
here and Nesbitt is a professor at La 
Roche College, the two partners con
tinue to find more and more students
interested in part-time 
and full-time work in 
their studio.
Uy and Nesbitt have also 
founded the Pittsburgh 
Urban Magnet Project 
(PUMP), a non-profit or
ganization comprised of 
restaurant owners, attor
neys, artists, and young 
graduates, which aims to 
find ways to keep young 
people in the city. Pitts
burgh has come a long 
way, said Lemme. The 
city is becoming a much 
cooler place for young 
people to live and work.

World-renowned pianist performs with Symphony
tion in Heinz Hall Friday night.
The orchestra performed three pieces, 
including the overture to Berliozs 
Beatrice and Benedict, Rachmaninoffs 
Concerto No. 2 in C minor for Piano and 
Orchestra, Opus 18, and Symphony No.
By AMY BERGER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
If music is the language the heart 
speaks, then the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra is fluent in it.
Guided by the passionate direction of 2 in D Major, Opus 43 by Sibelius, 
guest conductor Yuri Temirkanov, the Fridays performance marked Mikhail 
members of the PSO displayed their Rudys debut with the PSO. The worldimmense spirit, grace, and professionalrenowned pianist performed the 
ism while guest pianist Mikhail Rudy Rachmaninoff selection, 
brought the audience to a standing ovaI couldnt help but be captivated by the
sheer physical and 
mental energy Rudy 
put into his playing, 
but what struck me 
immediately about 
the soloist and the 
orchestra was their 
amazing balance. 
Even with a very 
large ensemble be
hind him, the intri
cacies of Rudys play
ing came through 
consistently.
Saying that 
Mikhail Rudy has 
impressive training 
and experience 
would be a gross un
derstatement. The 
Russian-born pia
nist studied with 
Jakov Flier at the 
Moscow Conserva
tory, and won the 
1975 Marguerite 
Long Competition in 
Paris. He made his 
American debut 
i. ow with the Cleveland 
Mikhail Rudy added his piano talent to Friday's concert. Orchestra in 1981,
and debuted in Britain in with the Lon
don Symphony Orchestra in 1988. Since 
then, he has performed with the Berlin 
Philharmonic, the Boston and Montreal 
Symphonies, and the St. Petersburg Phil
harmonic, just to name a few. Rudy is 
currently the Music Director of the St. 
Riquier Festival in France, and his re
cordings for EMI have won several in
ternational awards.
The evenings guest conductor, Yuri 
Temirkanov, who returned to the PSO 
for the first time since 1994, also has a 
dazzling record of experience. Before 
being named principal conductor of the 
St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, 
he was artistic director of the Kirov 
Opera. His European appearances in
clude the Vienna Philharmonic, 
LOrchestre de Paris, and Londons Royal 
Philharmonic.
Listening to the PSO was an absolute 
pleasure. The balance and blend of in
struments was superb. The inner voices, 
such as cello, viola, and French horns, 
blended beautifully with the soloist and 
the more prominent instruments. The 
size and power of the ensemble didnt 
even prevent the lyrical clarinet and 
oboe solos from filling the concert hall 
during the Rachmaninoff piece.
The individual parts complemented 
each other well, but I felt that the brass ' 
section was unnecessarily overpower
ing in the Sibelius symphony. It only 
took a section of three trumpets to domi
nate the entire orchestra. The wood
wind section performed beautifully 
though, and the individual oboe, clari
net, and bassoon parts were easy to 
distinguish and follow.
The most disturbing part ofthe evening

City arts center opens new show
By NIA RODGERS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The PittsburghCenter for the Arts 
celebrated the opening of a provoquant 
trio of exhibits with a reception on 
Friday night.
The first exhibition, More Non
sense, is by sculptor Brett Day. Since 
it forms part of his Decoy series, 
each piece in the exhibition is a bird,
to create a concept of the general 
intellectual, moral, and cultural cli
mate of the era. A few individual 
pieces stand out, among them an un
titled and brilliantly colorful work by 
Kate Biaz that clearly represents fe
male genitalia. Digitally-enhanced 
photos by David Woolf seem to illus
trate inner conflicts by superimpos
ing images of burning and freezing 
forms onto the body of a man, and
Alone, many of the works seem very 
meaningless and arbitrary; just stuff 
somebody thought looked neat Together 
the pieces are a telling portrait of our 
commercialism and populism. ________________
but not just any old bird. There is a 
peacock made of crutches and a goose 
whose body is formed by a cradle. There 
are a pair of swans whose long necks 
loop around one another and then re
cede to the interior of their respective 
wooden bodies. The decoys are deli
cate and consist of very formal struc
tures made of found objects and slen
der unfinished blocks of wood. Isolated 
and frozen in some ritual of mournful
ness, each piece evokes sympathy for 
something trapped in the rigidity of its 
structure and time. In fact, the title of 
one piece is In His Own Cage. Yet 
overall, the pieces are light-hearted, 
especially I Tawt, I Taw.... And well, 
theyre just fun to look at.
The next exhibition, Zeitgeist, fea
tures work by 27 artists in an attempt
another untitled, graffiti-like work by 
Joan Brechin Sonnenberg demand 
commendation. Modern Skyscraper, 
a multimedia sculpture by Robert 
Slenker, combines circuit boards with 
messy wood and glue and seems to 
focus on the conflict between tech
nology and our desire for simplicity 
and naturalness.
However, many of the pieces seem 
condescendinga note pad with spots 
on it, a page of pencil scribbles, pol
ished wooden blocks, what looks like 
gigantic slides of mutated cells from a 
biology lab, a video that reminded me 
of a make-up commercial. Alone, many 
of the works seem very meaningless 
and arbitrary; just stuff somebody 
thought looked neat. Together, the

Carnegie celebrates industrial design movement
By TOM LIN
Tartan Staffwriter
What the modern world is, and 
how we look at it, was influenced 
to a large degree by designers. At 
least, this is the premise upon 
which the Carnegie Art Museums 
Designing the Modern World 
1885-1945: The Arts of Reform 
and Persuasion is based. The ex
hibit looks at American and Eu
ropean design, and how that de
sign changed the world during a 
time when the world was already 
undergoing incredible change.
Designing the Modern World 
focuses upon American and Eu
ropean manifestations of design
in objects including napkins, the
ater seats, cjocks, bowls, radios, 
rugs, books, posters, tables, 
chairs, and even a Volkswagen 
bug. Part history lesson and part 
art showcase, this display fea
tures more than 250 works of art, 
including untraditional objects 
dart from posters to appliances.
Design has been a key element 
throughout history, and accord
ingly, the exhibition is divided 
into three chronological sections. 
The modern world as it is thought 
of today first appeared at the end 
ofthe 19th century, and brought 
with it the Industrial Revolution. 
In response to this, Confronting
Part history lesson and part art 
showcase, this display features more 
than 250 works of art, including 
many untraditional objects dart... 
Modernity presents artwork that 
either resists or accepts the new 
modernity. In large part, it deals 
with the Arts and Crafts move
ment, and its backlash towards 
industry that diminished or re
placed creativity. In addition, 
there are three smaller divisions; 
Romantic Nationalism, the 
manifestation of a countrys iden
tity through its art; Nature and 
New Art, which draws upon 
nature for inspiration for art
works; and Art and Industry, 
the drive to use machines to 
massproduce artistically vi
able yet economical goods.
Celebrating Modernity fo
cuses on a time period when art
ists were asked to show that the 
modern world and innovation 
improved the quality of life, with
out endangering tradition. This 
is split into four distinct parts: 
Time and Motion, a showcase 
of art that focuses on speed and 
progress; Brave New Worlds, 
the artistic imagination of the 
vertical city as well as the fu
ture; Design for Machine, a pre
sentation of streamlining for 
household appliances; and Tra
ditions Transformed, which fo
cuses on a period when continu
ity with past designs, especially 
Greek and Roman, was of great 
importance.

Gloom and doom fill Empire
By GREG MARCKS
' Tartan Staffwriter
As a Special Edition, the changes to
 The Empire Strikes Back were much 
more subtle than in Star Wars. With 
the exception of two exteriors of the 
Cloud City, most of the computer gener
ated changes were hardly noticeable, 
merely adding a welcome sense of depth.
 In contrast, much like Greedo getting a
 shot off first in the Star Wars cantina,
 the inserted sound of Luke screaming 
as he falls down the central shaft of
i Cloud City seemed gratuitous and un> necessary. The motivated sound worked
- extremely well, except for a distracting
 steam pipe in my right ear while Han 
was being frozen. Overall though, audi
ences are not likely to notice any major
< differences between this Special Edi
tion and the original.

BackSpecial Edition 
Director: Irvin Kirshner 
Company: Twentieth 
Century Fox
Its hard for me to imagine The Em
pire Strikes Back as a film in itself 
rather than merely a connecting link in 
the trilogy. While Star Wars and Re
turn of the Jedi are both fairly selfcontained by the needs to destroy both 
Death Stars, The Empire Strikes Back
 serves more as the Double Stuff creamy
 filling for the overall Oreo.
Han Solo, having shed his selfish skin 
at the end of Star Wars, still retains his 
- essential rogueness by smugly main' taining that Leia is in love with him. 
(He is, of course, right.) Darth Vader 
becomes frustrated and more abusive 
of his neat throat-choking trick, as he
fails him. Luke reveals himself as an 
impetuous, stubborn hothead who only 
learns his lesson after getting his hand 
chopped off.
Naturally, the highlight of Empire is 
Yoda. Introduced as an eccentric, comi
cal muppet, he turns out to be a serious, 
wise muppet, powerful enough to scare 
people just by saying, You will be.

By JAY MIOLLA
Tartan Contributing Editor
 As I spent thirty minutes circling 
Smallman Street, I should have antici, pated what was in store at Metropol. A 
seemingly infinite line of people sat out
side doors hoping to find tickets to the 
sold out Airwalk Sno-Core concert. Yours 
truly managed to dodge that 
nasty situation and make his 
way into the already packed 
club. I was barely in the front 
door when I was hit with the 
numerous kiosks and stands 
that highlighted the sponsors 
of the event. Sony, Troj an, Roll*ing Stone, Volkswagen, The 
 O (Just kidding about The 
0, but, it seemed that it 
wouldnt be out of place.) When
- J finally got into the main room 
&nd looked out onto a sea of 
heads with all shapes, colors
nd textures represented  
r ;and trust me all colors were
- represented.
* * Orange 9mm was the first 
'band to play. As they set up on
-jtage, you could feel tension 
Ijieginning to build. More 
' people packed in and the lights 
turned down.
1 - The lead singer headed to 
 the front of the stage and
- quickly introduced the band 
then gave the crowd a big old
,jL, 2, 3, Yeah! From then the 
!- intensity was pushed up sev! eral notches. The mosh pit en! gulfed about half of the main floor, but 
I no matter where you stood, it always
* seemed like you were in it. For those 
v unfamiliar with Orange 9mm, they are a 
; punk/hard-core band out of New York 
I pity that have been earning their place 
I in the music industry. Their sound is big 
; and the rifts are tried and true. They 
vhave a funky flavor with the vocals 
; and lay it on thick. Their show on 
; Saturday was as intense as the audi1 ence could handle and that crowd could 
i handle a lot.
Voodoo Glow Skulls were the next you compare the Voodoo Glow Skulls to 
band to hit the stage. People started to the Pharcyde. The Pharcyde came out 
get very riled up while the roadies were on stage four strong. They were missing 
gettingthe equipment ready. I had never the fifth member, Fat Lip. I was slightly 
heard of Voodoo Glow Skulls before I disappointed about this, but I quickly 
came to the concert, but I have definitely forgot because they really rocked the 
heard of them now. They come out onto house. People in the crowd really didnt 
the stage with a sevenpiece band. Three know what to make of these guys. They 
hom players, guitar player, bass player, looked a little confused but eventually
welcomed this different 
style of music.
The final band of the 
Airwalk Sno-Core con
cert was a band called 
Face to Face. They are 
a punk-rock band from 
southern California 
who have been known 
for their intense work 
ethic and their dedica
tion to their fans. They 
are a three-piece band, 
but you would never 
know it because they 
really have a big sound. 
Like the Pharcyde, they 
too were missing a 
member. The bass 
player was hurt a week 
back at another show, so 
they had one of the 
roadies fillingin, but this 
didnotseemto stop them 
 they still had great 
stage presence. Judging 
by the swelling moshpit, 
the crowd loved Face to 
Face. These guys were 
for real.
The bands were very 
drummer, and a singer. Their sound was good and the crowd was really into it, 
a ska meets punk style with some but the commercial aspect of the concert 
hard-core parts to change it up. The was very forced and in your face. Its 
overall sound was huge. The mix of the one thing to put your companys name

thought so too, and now the pit took up 
the entire floor.
The Pharcyde is one of my favorite 
bands of all time. They are a rap band 
out of Los Angeles which 
around for about three year
samples of stuff, testing stations for your 
product and constantly mentioning your

ON THE TUBE
by Dan Rosenberg
This year, Grammy voters will be 
finding themselves choosing between 
apples and U-hauls, as nominees in 
several of this years categories are as 
different as night and day. Country 
sweetheart LeeAnn Rimes is compet
ing against Garbage and The Tony 
Rich Project for artist of the year, while 
pop diva Celine Dion is taking on the 
edgier Alanis Morisette and The 
Smashing Pumpkins for Record of 
the Year.
Even stranger is the competition for 
best spoken word album. Award-win
ning performers Jack Lemmon, Mar
tin Landau, Gregory Peck, and Lauren 
Bacall are taking on Edward Asner, 
Ellen Burstyn, ERs C.C.H. Pounder, 
Alfre Woodard, Charles Kuralt, and, 
of all people, First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, a first-time 
Grammy nominee for her book It 
Takes a Village.
Tthe Presidents of the United States 
of America are nominated and com
peting with Journey, the Gin Blos
soms, and the Beatles for best perfor
mance by a pop group. Who would 
have thought that the Fab Four (mi
nus one) would ever be competing 
against the Presidents of the USA?
Although the nominations are di
verse, this years winners will be tradi
tional Grammy victors. Celine Dion 
will follow in the footsteps of fellow 
divas Whitney Houston, Mari ah Carey, 
and Bette Midler in claiming several 
major awards, including Album of the 
Year for Falling Into You, BestFemale 
Pop Performance, Best Pop Album, 
and Record of the Year for Because 
You Loved Me (The Theme from Up 
Close and Personal). Meanwhile, 
Grammy voters will continue to give 
their songwriting prize to a performer
(last year they gave the award to Seal). 
Being the only nominated performer 
who wrote her own ballad, Tracy 
Chapman should easily win Song of 
the Year for Give Me One Reason.
Sentiment will also govern the day 
in other categories. The Beatles will 
be officially welcomed back by win
ning a Grammy for their recent single 
Free as a Bird. Meanwhile, the re
vered quartet of Bacall, Landau, 
Lemmon, and Peck will trounce the 
First Lady and their fellow acting 
competition. The Broadway musical 
Rent will win for Best Show Album, 
a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the 
shows creator who passed away be
fore his vision became Broadways 
biggest smash.
The most competitive of the major 
categories is Best New Artist, which 
features Garbage, Jewel, No Doubt, 
The Tony Rich Project, and LeeAnn 
Rimes. Despite fierce competition, 
Rimes seems like a sure bet. How can 
the Grammy voters vote against the 
fourteen year-old songstress whose 
voice has been likened, justifiably, to 
the great Patsy Cline?
In other categories, past winners 
Eric Clapton, Whitney Houston, and 
Bruce Springsteen will win for per
forming Change the World, Exhale 
(Shoop, Shoop), and Dead Man 
Walkin, respectively. Meanwhile, The 
Smashing Pumpkins, No Doubt, The 
Fugees, and The Tony Rich Project 
will all win Best Album in their re
spective categories. The Smashing 
Pumpkins will also win for the song 
1979, while the Fugees will cap a 
second trophy for their rendition of 
Rilling Me Softly with His Song.
Additional winners wall be Cleve
land Orchestra conductor Pierre 
Boulez for Best Orchestral Perfor
mance, Whitney Houston and CeCe 
Winans for their duo Count on Me 
from the film Waiting to Exhale, music 
legends Tony Bennett and Luther 
Vandross in the traditional pop and 
R&B categories, andBabyface, as com
poser of Exhale (Shoop, Shoop) and 
Producer of the Year.
Ellen DeGeneres will host The 39th 
Annual Grammy Awards, airing on 
CBS this Wednesday at 8:00 pm EST.

to ask the experiencer to look

Wallace & Gromit: The Best 
of Aardman Animation
For those who have never experienced the won
ders created by Nick Park and Peter Lord, come 
check out the greatest claymations ever. Wallace & 
Gromit have appeared in three short films: A Grand 
Day Out, The Wrong Trousers, and A Close Shave. 
In addition to these, other Aardman shorts will be 
squeezed in, such as Creature Comforts.
Wallace is a big bald guy with five fingers on each 
hand, and Gromit is his silent dog. Together they 
enjoy lots of cheese and biscuits at teatime, except 
when evil penguins move in, or robotic dogs start 
rustling sheep, or they decide to vacation on the 
moon. Mostly they just sit around, though.

Goodfellas
Mr. Clean will clean up brain and blood and guts 
in just a minute. Mr. Clean will clean up Pescis 
head, and everything thats in it. Mr. Clean, Mr. 
Clean, Mr. Clean!
Its just one of those images that sticks with you: 
blood pumping out of a mans head all over an 
expensive oriental rug. Thats a stain thats going to 
linger, I must say. Join Marty Scorcese andhis band 
of wacky hoodlums as they take each other out in 
the streets ofNew York City. Hailed as the only good 
movie Ray Liotta ever starred in, this film also 
employs Robert DeNiro and, of course, Joe Pesci, 
who got an Oscar for his cranial trouble.

The Godfather Part II
Rarely is a sequel as good as the original. Fortu
nately, this exception to the rule raked in six Oscars 
and kicked some serious Italian butt.
Francis Ford Coppola does it again with the help 
of A1 Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and 
Robert DeNiro, who won Best Actor. More impor
tantly, this film saved Bruno Kirby (who played a 
punk teenager in Disneys Superdad the same year) 
from a career of teen exploitation films.
I watched this movie in20-minute segments at 
three in the morning, but order now and you can see 
it in its entirety. Bring a smoking pistol and a box of 
cannolis, and make it a Godfather night.

Blood Simple
You might remember the Coen brothers from last 
years Fargo or from Raising Arizona with Holly 
Hunter. Well, this is the duos first feature film, and 
Holly Hunter is in this one too. Im serious! If you 
can find her, someone (not me) might give you a 
piece of sweet, chewy candy.
As a film noir, this is a dark, twisted tale involving 
a cheating wife, a private investigator, and the 
entire drunken state of Texas. Together, Ethan and 
Joel slurped down a rusty bucketful of Tasters 
Choice and came up with this crazy idea. But after 
their automatic toast-butterer exploded, they 
scrapped their ideas and started making movies 
instead. Enjoy!

Film typifies French directors work
ByWLADIMIRLABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
As far as self-conscious crime 
stories go, Claude Chabrol is the 
man to beat. Chabrol is one of the 
founding members of the French 
New Wave and the director of 
arguably the first film of the moveCourtesy of MK2 Productions 
Cabrol creates moral tension by showing 
guilt in almost all of his characters.
ment, Le Beau Serge. Like those 
of the other members of the move
ment, Chabrols films come from 
a love of old movies. His own 
films owe as much to Hitchcock
and Hollywood potboilers as they 
do to Fritz Lang and to Cocteaus 
experiments. While Truffaut and 
Godard explored (or collapsed) 
various traditional genres, 
Chabrol has concentrated to this 
day to the granddaddy of genres, 
the crime story.
With his latest, La Crmonie, 
we have perhaps the 
quintessential Chabrol 
movie. Most elements 
are there - the dissec
tion of the bourgeois 
family, the irony of the 
crime and yes, the food. 
In fact, the title of the 
film may refer to us as 
viewers. Up to a point, 
we know what is going 
to happen because this 
is a Chabrol film. In the 
opening scene we are as 
disturbed as Jacqueline 
Bisset when presented 
to Sandrine Bonnaires 
puzzle of a maid. From 
then on, the story is in
deed a ceremony and 
like all good ceremonies, 
we are smack in the 
middle of it until it ends.
Another Chabrol trait 
is the cynicism with 
which he avoids, or goes 
around the political overtones of 
the stories. Isabelle Hupperts 
childlike and bitter postmistress 
(Chabrols version of a dis
gruntled postal worker, I guess)
provides the driving force for a alists of the movement, the Cathoportrayal of class warfare at its lies of the New Wave, so to speak, 
most morbidly ridiculous. In this It is maybe an amusing coincione, not even the children are dence that Rohmer and Chabrol 
spared, not even Virginie are the only active members left 
Ledoyens socially self-conscious in the French New Wave (with 
daughter. Hupperts character the exception of the conundrums 
has judged them all to hell. It is that Godard makes every five 
only at the end that the family years or so), 
gets what is perhaps a merciful
look from Huppert and Bonnaire 
as they watch them enj oy a broad
cast of Don Giovanni.
These elements of judgment, 
guilt, and mercy are what sepa
rates Chabrol from ordinary 
crime stories. In Hitchcock, the 
plot is constructed around a ten
sion between the characters, but 
it is only a basic tension, the fear 
of getting caught. Hitchcock can 
do this because he has in the 
story an audience 
surrogate, the inno
cent victim (be it 
Grace Kelly, or 
even Cary Grant).
There is no such 
luxury in a Chabrol 
story, and the ten
sion he constructs 
is a moral tension 
where almost all 
characters are 
guilty. This tone of 
his otherwise ordi
nary crime dramas 
is what puts him in 
league with 
Rohmer as the morLa Crmonie is playing 
through March 6 at the Harris 
Theater, downtown. You can 
download the trailer from http:// 
www.netsurf.org/~gauche/Trailers/. A lot of Chabrols films are 
available on video. If, like me, you 
end up swooning over Ms. Ledoyen 
and Ms. Huppert, you can check 
out their sites at http://

Bluegrass legend graces local stage
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
Bluegrass, like jazz, chop suey, 
and (possibly) the tomato, is a 
distinctly American invention. 
Based on the rapid rhythms of 
Irish reels, the Kiting harmony of 
Appalachian gospel music, and 
the 3/4 time of old-time waltzes, 
bluegrass rose from the Ozarks 
in the 1940s when a youngster 
named Bill Monroe picked up a 
banjo and began to play.
Why should you, a modern stu
dent of the Fugees and Fiona 
Apple, care about guitar-pickers 
and fiddle-players? Bluegrass is 
apiece of Americas heritage, and 
it, along with blues and straight 
gospel, created the style of music 
that our fifty nifty United States 
are known for.
On Saturday night, a legend 
rose from out of this heritage to 
perform on the stage of the 
Carnegie Lecture Hall: Ralph
Stanley, progenitor of the Natu
ral Mountain Sound of bluegrass. 
Remember when Paul Simon 
played Wake Up, Little Susie 
on the best-of album? Well, that 
song was written by the Everly 
Brothers, who are direct descen
dants of the bluegrass lineage. 
And the Adam and Eve of this 
lineage was Ralph Stanley.
Stanley and his Clinch Moun
tain Boys worked through a set 
that would remind some of HeeHaw, others of Austin City Lim
its on PBS or Mountain Stage on 
NPR. They performed the halfremembered standards (Orange 
Blossom Special, Sitting On Top 
of the World) as well as a beau
tiful medley of gospel and love 
songs that raised the roof of the 
large venue. Stanleys band fea
tured his son, Ralph II, the dap
per and exuberant bassist Jack 
Cooke, and the guitarist James 
Shelton. The band also included 
an expert fiddle player (James
Price) and mandolinist John 
Rigsby.
What made this concert spe
cial? The dry humor of Stanley 
and Price bantering back and 
forth. The high, lonesome harmo
nies that are the crux of all blue
grass. The fast-paced songs and 
the noodlings by individual play
ers that added, incredibly, to the 
whole. Imagine, if you would, jazz 
speeded up and performed in a 
country idiom  that is the in
tensity and cohesion of bluegrass.
Stanley was taught banjo by 
his mother, and began playing in 
1947 with his brother Carter. 
Together, the Stanley Brothers 
performed their music all over 
the country. In 1966, Carter 
Stanley passed away, but Ralph 
continued to perfect his art and 
created the Clinch Mountain 
Boys, a group dedicated to con
tinuing the bluegrass tradition. 
Previous members of the band 
include such country legends as
Dwight Yoakum.
Bluegrasss popularity waned 
in the 70s as the folk explosion 
fizzled out. Artists like Bob Dylan 
and Johnny Gash still used the 
idiom commercially, but only 
Stanley, Bill Monroe, and a hand
ful of others kept the music alive. 
Today, bluegrass is doing well. 
Although Monroe recently passed 
away, bluegrass festivals thrive 
in the summer and Calliope, 
Pittsburghs folk music society 
(http:/1 trfn.clpgh.org I calliope) 
offers classes in bluegrass guitar 
and repertoire and brings groups 
like the Clinch Mountain Boys to 
entertain and teach.
Ralph Stanley and his ilk are 
an important part of anyones pop 
cultural history. The Spin Doc
tors never could have risen with
out jazz, jazz never could have 
risen without blues, and blues 
could never have risen without 
gospel. Where else did gospel go? 
You guessed it: bluegrass.
