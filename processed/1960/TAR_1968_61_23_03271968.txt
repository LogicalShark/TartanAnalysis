Referendum to Evaluate Attitudes on Student Govt.
Volume 61  Number 23
Faculty Petition Asks That 
Military Recruitment Be Banned
Members of the faculty have
* circulated a petition asking that 
military recruitment be banned 
from the campus of CarnegieMelllon until such time as Gen
eral Hershey rescinds his me
morandum dealing with the induction of demonstrators. 
James Hastie, of the English 
Department, has cited the CMU 
faculty concern about the use 
of the Selective as a punitive 
instrument which denies due 
process to student engaged in 
demonstrations against the 
draft or against military recruit
ment as a basis for the intro
duction of this issue at the Aca
demic Affairs Committee on 
Monday, March 25th.
Entitled Recommended Re
sponse to the Policy of Punitive 
Conscription, the text of the 
faculty petition follows:
On October 26, General Her
shey issued a memorandum to 
all local draft boards recom
mending conscription of men 
involved in illegal demonstra
tions against the Selective Ser
vice and against military re
cruiters. Since then Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark indicated 
that this action is improper ex
cept in activities affecting an 
individuals own draft status. 
The AAUP sent a telegram pro
testing the memorandum, seven 
congressmen called it a denial 
of due process, and Representa
tive John Moss of California 
called for Hersheys resigna
tion. Nevertheless, Hershey has 
not recind his memo; indeed, 
he has reiterated it through 
public statements.
The presence of military re
cruiters on campus invites stu
dent demonstrations which 
could, under General Hersheys 
policy, result in punishment dis
pensed by the draft board with
out due process of law. For 
this reason Columbia, Cornell, 
Dartmouth, George Washing
ton, Princeton, and Yale have 
barred military recruiters from 
their campuses so long as stu
dent demonstrators are vulner
able to this extra-legal punish
ment. We urge quick adoption 
of a ban on use of Carnegie-Mellon University facilities for mil
itary recruiting until General 
Hershey rescinds his memoran
dum of October 26. We further 
request immediate notification 
of this ban to the heads of mili
tary recruiting for all services, 
to General Hershey, to the State 
Director of Selective Service, 
and to President Johnson.
In supporting this ban we do 
not collectively take any pos
ition on the merits of campus 
recruiting, student demonstra
tions, of the Vietnam war. We 
do join together to prevent our
students from being subjected 
to recriminations outside of our 
judicial system or outside nor
mal University disciplinary pro
cedures.
Neutrality Is Policy 
In Student Politics
It is traditional at CMU that 
the students decide their own 
form of government. Thus, in 
the present student situation 
the administration will main
tain a neutral position.
Should the students decide to 
change their form of govern
ment the administration would 
be prepared to recognize the 
new regime. Until such a de
cision is made, student congress 
is recognized as the duly con
stituted body representing the 
undergraduates.

Dobroski Awarded 
Danforth Fellowship
Bernard J. Dobroski, a senior 
music major at Carnegie-Mellon 
University has won a Danforth 
Graduate Fellowship which will 
permit him to study for his 
Ph.D. at the college or univers
ity of his choice.
The Danforth Graduate Fel
lowship is awarded to a limited 
number of recipients each year 
and is given only to those stu
dents who indicate an intent to 
make college teaching their ca
reer.

Score Referendum 
To Be Run by A Phi 0
Alpha Phi Omegia has been 
asked and has agreed to run 
the SCORE Referendum on 
March 28 and 29. This is being 
done as a service to the student 
body. The fraternity is in no 
way affiliated with SCORE or 
any other political organization; 
the significance of this referen
dum is not a question for Alpha 
Phi Omega to be concerned 
with. It should be pointed out 
that voting in this referendum 
in no way affects voting in Stu
dent Government elections. Cur
rent white plastic I.D. card 
will be punched as a record of 
voting.
Black Ballr Woods Showr 
Features of Satori
The Beaux Arts Ball Commitee is presenting a weekend 
this spring called SATORI. This 
total event will happen Friday, 
May 3 through Sunday, May 5 
at a 20-acre private estate W2 
hours drive north of Tech. Tic
kets will be $5.00 per person, 
which covers the entire week
ends schedule of events. Limit
ed transportation will be pro
vided to and from the main 
events.
There will be a Circus Tent, 
tree houses, swings, and ham
mocks scattered throughout the 
property. Rock e Roll, Rhythm
& Blues, Psychedelic and Soul 
Groups will perform through
out. Fantasy Unlimited, import
ed from New York, will stage 
an Outdoor Show In The Woods 
Friday night and a show within 
the tent Saturday night. Both 
shows are entirely new environ
mental concepts originated by 
the Beaux Arts Ball Committee. 
Saturday night starting at sun
set commences The Black Ball, 
the weekends main event, based 
on the traditions of past Beaux 
Arts Balls. At midnight there 
will be costume awards and un
masking. The theme covers 
everything from occult to the 
surrealistic.
The Beaux Arts Committee 
and the Spring Carnival Com
mittee wish to stress the fact 
that SATORI is not intended as 
a rival of Spring Carnival. Both 
Beaux Arts and Spring Carnival 
Committee members have been 
working together to plan a 
weekend that will appeal to the 
Entire student body. As it is a 
three-day weekend it will be pos
sible for students to take part 
in activties of both events. The 
choice of this particular date 
was made for lack of any other 
long weekends that were not 
either too early in the season 
or too late in the Acedemic Year. 
The site was chosen because of 
its close relationship to the 
theme and the lack of adaquate 
facilities on campus. The suc
cess of this years satori guaran
tees the realization of the Beaux 
Arts Committees plans for fu
ture events.
Posters will announce the 
time and place of ticket sales.
Brown Assures 
Petition Decision
Dean Brown has given an ac
knowledgement of President 
Stevers receipt of the more 
than 650 students signature on 
the petition to ban all military 
recruitment on this campus un
til General Hershey rescinds his 
memorandum advising local 
boards to draft demonstrators.
Dean Brown assured the spon
sors of the petition that initial 
consideration of their petition 
would be given at an early 
meeting of the presidents staff. 
He suggested that this group
SCORE, the Student Coopreative Organization for Responsi
bility in Education, will spon
sor a referendum on Thursday 
and Friday, 28 and 29 March.
The referendum, to be con
ducted by the brothers of Alpha 
Phi Omega, will be unique in 
several respects. First, it will 
not be a simple yes-oio referen
dum. Second, there will be, at 
times, six polling places. Third, 
graduate students are invited 
to vote in the referendum (a 
space will be provided to indi
cate graduate or undergraduate 
status to insure statistical val
idity.)
The three questions to be 
featured in the referendum will 
be as follows.
I. Because the Executive 
Council, the Student Senate, and 
the Student Court have proven 
themselves ineffective and unNew Tartan Staff

A new staff of editors will

the year only to offer advice, 
if asked.
Positions open are. Editor-inChief, Managing Editor, Bus

will ask a number of other per
sons and groups on the cam
pus to discuss this request be
fore a final decision is made.
He assured these sponsors 
that such a decision, however, 
would be forthcoming within a 
relatively short time.
able to institute the necessary 
internal reform, I feel that it 
is not in my best interest to rec
ognize Student Government as 
the representative of the under
graduate student body in any 
dealings with the administra
tion of this university or any 
other student, faculty, or offcampus organization.
H. I support the maintenance 
of Student Government in its 
present form because I feel that 
Student Government has been 
effective in representing the un
dergraduate community in its 
dealings with administration 
and faculty, and that it is a sat
isfactory communications Idnk 
between members of those bod
ies and the undergraduate stu
dent body as well as among the 
members of the undergraduate 
student body.
HI. The concept of student 
government has no meaning to 
me or to my activities as a stu
dent. Therefore, I am indiffer
ent to whether or not a student 
government exists or what 
form it may take.
The statements have been des
igned to remove most grey 
areas in student beliefs and to 
promote statistical validity.
Following places will be set 
up to facilitate ease of voting. 
The stations to be occupied, as 
agreed upon by Alpha Phi Ome
ga and SCORE representatives, 
will be in the fallowing areas 
at the following times.

SCORE feels that this will 
enable the largest number of 
students, including commuters, 
to vote.
One more twist which will be 
instituted for the SCORE refer
endum will be the request for 
voters to furnish corroborative 
identification. This wi elimin
ate multiple voting and will en
able each student to decide for 
himself what he shall do with 
his vote. Once the student has 
voted, his identiflcaion card will 
be punched.

The $55 Million Capitol Fun Drive
Photo by Bill Pence 
2nd floor ScobellCracked and chipped plaster in door frame 
(hand for scale)
Recently, it was announced to 
the community that Carnegie - 
Mellon University has opened a 
fund drive which, it is advertis
ed, will promise to be one of the 
biggest in our history.
The announcement included no 
plans for adequate student hous
ing. We have since learned that 
new housing construction is plan
ned in about four years. The na
ture of the housing is, as yet un
known, for concrete plans have 
not yet been discussed.
This is an error in priorties,
we feel. If one looks at the pre
sent fraternity facilities, and then 
walks over to the mens dormitor
ies on the hill, it would be an 
oddman, indeed, who would de
cide that the fraternity system 
needed new housing first.
And yet, our administration has 
.been able to come to that con
clusion. Now, we know that fra
ternity alumni contribute more 
money per capita than non-fratemity alumni. But it would seem 
fairly evident that the men have 
to stay alive long enough to join
a fraternity for the alumni associ
ation, and, consequently, our 
pocketbook, to benefit.
The dormitories on the hill are 
rat and cockroach infested. Dur
ing the first semester, men are 
forced to live and sleep in rooms 
with exposed steam pipes, com
plete with steam. The fire condi
tions are, to say the ltist. horri
ble. One door for sixty men has 
never been recommended.
In addition, plaster is falling 
off the walls where there is still 
plaster left to fall off, water foun
tains are set near wash tubs, doors 
are ill fitting if they fit at all. 
and windo panes are missing from 
several windows.
We feel that the administration 
should stop deluding itself into 
believing that we are a first-rate 
institution so long as we maintain 
fifth or sixth rate housing. What 
is needed are some plans now 
 for new dormitory facilities, 
with the inclusion of coed dormi
tory housing.
Now, what do we propose be 
done about this s]jp up? Well, 
since we have learned that pure 
appealing does no good, we sug
gest the following.
In order to show that they value 
the welfare of the student body 
as much as they say, we demand 
that the administration of Carnegie-Mellon University publish, 
within one month of this printing, 
concrete evidence that new dor
mitory construction shall begin 
within two years of this coming 
June, and that the present condi
tions which exist in the mens 
dorms shall be eliminated by 
September, 1968. including a 
program of fumigation, vermin 
elimination, painting, plastering,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Improve Situation: 
Must Eliminate Part
Editor, the Tartan:
Thank you for bringing to 
the foreground an issue that 
has been neglected much, much 
too long: that Student Govern
ment has indeed been too pas
sive, if not neglectful, in rep
resenting the students.
Student Government is pop
ulated by three basic types of 
people: A, those who are only 
so that they will have something 
to put beside their picture in 
the yearbook; B, thoie who want 
to play big government, play 
with parliamentary procedure;
C, those who actively want to 
improve student opportunities
on this campus. Unfortunately, 
at present, the As and Bs are 
in such large proportion that 
the Cs in many cases find 
themselves handcuffed.
SCORE indeed would remedy 
this by eliminating the As and 
Bs. Unfortunately, it also 
thwarts those who would work 
for a better university life. With 
no responsible group existing 
to which the administration can 
entrust the management of such 
things as Homecoming and 
Spring Carnival (they certain
ly will not recognize a group 
of interested students), these 
events will cease to exist. In 
addition, the administration pre
tends to please the majority of 
the students and simply would 
not listen to a group of in
terested students unless this

need for a structured student

tion: in eliminating the As and 
Bs, dont eliminate the Cs. The 
result could be, and probably

Presidential Quality 
Found in Ron Haan
Editor, the Tartan:
I am writing to express my 
support for Ron Haan for the 
office of President of Student 
Government. It is no secret that 
I opposed Mr. Haans candidacy 
last year because I did not feel 
that he was presidential ma
terial, and, if I did not feel 
that Mr. Haan had changed 
since that time, I would work 
against him again in this cam
paign.
While active in Student Gov
ernment, Mr. Haan served on 
nine committees, of which he 
chaired six, and was responsi
ble for the adoption of the com
bined Library-I.D. cards, and 
many changes in the policy 
of the food service, including 
the unlimited seconds available 
to those men on contract. Mr. 
Haan has often demonstrated 
his ability to get things done.
He was also active tin Mens 
Dormitory Council, and in the 
Intramural sports program, 
facts which, when combined with 
his other experience, give him 
a knowledge of the needs of 
most of the special interest 
groups on campus.

Mr. Haan has the experience 
necessary for successfully deal
ing with the students and the 
administration, the drive to fol
low programs to their conclu
sions, and (recently) has de
veloped a sufficiently tactful 
personality to enable him to ob
tain the services of qualified 
and able people to work with 
him  all the qualities that a 
good president needs.
I believe that Ron Haan is 
the best man campaigning for 
the office of Student Govern
ment President this year, and 
urge to give him your full sup

Investigation Needed 
In Food Service
Editor. The Tartan:
Inasmuch as finding a slice of 
human flesh in my meal was. to 
say the very least, disturbing. I 
feel that this letter is necessary.
It is unfortunate that foresight 
is not* always a human element; 
that our wisdom seems to come 
rather from hindsight. There is 
an intersection near the house 
where I used to live in Connecti
cut. It was not controlled by stop 
signs on any of the four corners. 
Although the neighborhood rec
ognized this as a dangerous situa
tion. and asked that stop signs be 
placed there, i t wasnt until a 
child on a tricycle was struck bv 
a car that the town complied  
thinking i t their own brilliant 
idea: We have determined that 
stop signs are necessary here to 
prevent an accident. How pro
found our hindsight be!
Now. there appears to be the 
existence of a very dangerous sit
uation in the operation of our Food 
Service in the Skibo cafeteria. I 
am on contract. Today marks 
the third day in a row that I have 
had to go out into the dining area
to get a rack of glasses and carry 
them over to the serving line. (By 
the way. I do not work there. I 
was eating there.) It seems that 
rather than keep a healthy supply 
of glasses on hand, the staff would 
rather wait until they are all gone, 
and the students in line start hol
lering for them. This is the easy 
way of discovering that something 
needs doing. Rather than keep the 
utensil racks replenished, they 
wait until people start calling for 
spoons, napkins, or trays. The line 
is too often held up because they 
have run out of food. When the 
milk machine i s not empty, i t 
squirts, splashes, foams and splat
ters. and it either overflows the 
glass or only fills it two-thirds of 
the wav. When the soda machine 
doesnt work properly, it is natur
ally easier to place an Out-ofOrder sign on it than it is to re
pair it. The juice machine always 
has its Refill light on. which 
means that nobody is watching 
it. The serving line is supposed to 
open for supper until 7 oclock in 
the evening  but just get there 
after 6:20 and good luck on the 
selection.
I consider all of these things to 
be the result of inefficiency, and 
inefficiency is the result of the 
worst kind of laziness. That kitch
en seems to be run solely for the 
convdnience of its employees, 
rather than the student who has 
paid about two dollars and eighttwo cents ($2.82) per day to eat 
there. Very little planning seems 
to get in the way of the joy ride. 
One easily gets the idea that the 
student is the very last, and the 
very least consideration.
This kind of laxity, laziness and 
lack of thinking leads me to be
lieve that should a kitchen em
ployee chop off her finger while 
making the salad, no effort would 
be made to retrieve the finger from 
the salad. After all. some student 
will find it  no problem! Just in 
case you feel that this supposition 
of mine is a little far-fetched, al
low me to relate to you an actual

Bingham Memorial Lecturer, Dr. K. Clark, to 
Discuss Racism and the Human Predicament
CMU TO 
PARTICIPATE 
IN BIOMEDICAL 
RESEARCH
Carnegie - Mellon University 
has been selected as one of six in
stitutions in the United States to 
develop planning studies of how 
modern technology can be put to 
work in the enhancement of bio
medical research and health care.
The program is sponsored by 
the National Academy of Engin
eering which has awarded the six 
institutions subcontracts totaling 
$140,285. Results of the studies 
will assist the Committee on Inter
play of Engineering with Biology 
and Medicine of the National 
Academy of Engineering in ful
filling a contract with the 
National Institutes of Health for 
recommendations on the develop
ment of biomedical engineering.
Participants in the project are 
Carnegie-Mellon University ($30,
000), Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, jointly with Harvard 
Medical School ($37,000), Ohio 
State University Research Found
ation ($21,282), the University of 
Virginia ($20,891), the University 
of Washington ($16,100), and the 
John Hopkins University ($14,985),
Basing its work on the needs and 
resources in its own locale, each 
university will :
1. Develop concepts for relating 
university activities in engineer
ing to the physical, biological, 
medical, social, and management 
sciences.
2. Identify and assess particular 
industrial and civic resources which 
can contribute toward a solution 
of the problem; study the opera
tions of health and medical care 
institutions; and focus on issues 
that can be resolved through col
laboration of medicine and engine
ering.
3. Develop prototype operation
al plans to secure the most effec
tive relationship among elements 
of industry, the community, and 
the university that will stimulate 
research and obtain the best com
bination of resources for dealing 
with vital medical and health care 
needs.
The National Academy of Enengineerings purpose, in this in
stance, is to initiate coordinated 
programs in biological and medi
cal research for the further bene
fit of society so as to accelerate 
the development of new instru
ments, artificial organs, devices 
for therapy and diagnosis, and 
other medical tools. Engineering 
concepts can also be applied, as 
in the design of automated clini
cal laboratories, to improve health 
care management.
While the research on the Car
negie - Mellon contract will be 
centered at the University, it will 
involve the cooperation of several 
other institutions in the commun
ityuniversities and colleges, hos
pitals, industrial and government 
agencies.
The research will bring to bear 
on the objectives of the study, the 
capabilities of Carnegie-Mellon 
and the community in the areas 
of systems design, architecture, 
communications information, eco
nomics management, psycho-soci
ology, instrumentation systems 
and biochemical analyses, trans
port processes, biomechanics and 
chemical kenetics, materials and 
Pfostheses, and other biotechno
logical activities.
Project director is Dr. George 
Bugliarello, professor of biotech
nology and civil engineering, and 
chairman of the biotechnology 
program established at CarnegieMellon in 1965 to provide a focal 
point for biomedical engineering 
training and research within the 
University and to serve as a link 
with medical and health activities 
in the community.
An eminent social psychologist, 
author and teacher, whose studies 
on racial segregation have been 
noted by the US Supreme Court, 
will deliver the 1968 Walter Van 
Dyke Bingham Memorial Lecture 
at Carnegie - Mellon University 
next week.
Dr. Kenneth Clark, president of 
the Metropolitan Applied Research 
Center and professor of pyschology at the City College of the Uni
versity of New York, will dis
cuss American Racism and the 
Human Predicament at Scaife 
Hall. April 3 at 4 pm.
The lecture will be the 14th in 
the distinguished series of annual 
addresses centering on the social 
implications of scientific and tech
nological advances in the life sci
ences. The series was initiated in 
1954 in honor of Dr. Walter Van 
Dyke Bingham, founder and di
rector of the Division of Applied 
Psychology at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology in 1915. The divi
sion was the first of its kind in 
the nation.
Dr. Clark, whose research on 
the psychlogical damage caused 
by segregation was cited by the 
US Supreme Court in its 1954 de
cision on school desegregation, 
is co - founder of the Northside 
Center for Child Development in 
New York City. He also founded 
Harlem Youth Opportunities Un
limited (HARYOU). and anti-pov
erty agency which produced the 
report. Youth in the Ghetto, and 
was research psychologist for the 
Gunnar Mydal study of the Ne
gro problem as it relates to mod
ern democracy, which has been 
published under the tile An Amer
ican Dilemma.
Dr. Clark is author of Prejudice 
and Your Child and Dark Ghetto: 
Dilemmas of Social Power, which 
won the Sidney Hillman Prize in 
1965. In addition, he has written 
for the Negro History Bulletin, 
edited The Negro Protest, and 
co-edited The Negro American.
He has taught at Howard Uni
versity. of which he is a trustee. 
Hampton Institute. Queens Col
lege. and has been visiting pro
fessor at Columbia Rniversity. 
Harvard University, and the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley. 
He is also a member of the New 
York State Board of Regents.
Born in Panama in 1914. Dr. 
Clark moved to New York City as 
a child. He received his B.A. and 
M.A degrees from Howard Uni
versity. and his Ph.D. from Col
umbia. He holds honorary degrees 
from the University of Massa
chusetts, Lincoln University, Mor
gan State College, and Tuskegee 
Institute.
In 1961, he received the Springarn Medal from the National As
sociation for the Advancement of 
Colored People, for whom he was 
a social science consultant. He 
won the Kurt Lewin Memorial 
Award in 1966. the same year he 
was appointed to the Council for 
the Humanities by President Lyn
don B.Johnson.
Dr. Clark has also been an ad
viser to the US State Department 
and consultant to the RAND Cor
poration, Western Electric Com
pany. and various foundations.
Marine Recruiters 
Here March 28
Captain Frank W. Tuckwiller 
of the Marine Officer Selection 
Office in Pittsburgh will be on 
campus at Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity on March 28 to interview 
and test students who wish to re
ceive a commission in the United 
States Marine Corps. Interviews 
and testing will be conducted in 
the Hallway of the Administra
tion Building while on campus.
The officer programs available 
to undergraduates are the Platoon 
Leaders Class (Ground) and Pla
toon Leaders Class (Aviation). 
These programs have two six-week 
training periods, which with suc
cessful completion, leads to a 
commission upon graduation. For 
seniors or recent graduates' there 
are the Officer Candidate Course 
and the Aviation Officer Candi
date Course, which requires suc
cessful completion of a ten-week 
training period after graduation

demand that the above decisions 
be made publicly.
In case such demands are not 
met, we say this.Whosoever shall 
represent the student body of 
Carnegie-Mellon University shall

priate mass media coverage, and 
shall attempt to bring the wretch

We are certain that students will 
be willing to go to great lengths 
to gain new dormitories.
An interesting sidelight in the 
announcement involves where the 
public statement was made-the 
Duquesne Club.
It is public knowledge that the 
Duquesne Club is an elitist, ra
cist outfit comprised of robberbarons and bigots of the first or
der.
This was a serious public re
lations error-but the public re
lations department here had noth
ing to do with it. Its the Mellons money, so, we must assume, 
the Mellons picked the spot.
The mistake was unnecessary. 
The Press Club is located near 
the Duquesne Club. And, for that 
matter, the announcement should 
have been made on this campus 
not downtown.

The Trial 
ofJeremyMott
Eight students from the Univ
ersity of Iowa campus are being 
charged with conspiracy charges 
for their participation in an antiDow demonstration on their cam
pus last December. Edwin Allaire, 
organizer of the local Resistance 
activities there, questions the 
charges as an attempt to prevent 
the expression of dissent:
The conspiracy charges are a 
naked attempt on the part of the 
authorities to suppress dissent. 
The demonstration of December 
5th was known well in advance by 
everyone, including police offic
ials and the university adminis
tration. However, since the de
tails of the demonstration were 
not known except those who plan
ned to participate, the police were 
on campus in force, inclrding 
sheriffs deputies from as far away as 75 miles.
he demonsteation was clear
ly non-violent. It was also, in all 
probability, legal. It consisted of 
four groups of about 50 people 
each moving from place to place 
on campus feinting obstructions. 
Of the many involved only 18 
were singled out for arrest. None 
was for an obvious violation of 
the law.
The eight people actually in
dicted for conspiracy to prevent 
law officers from carrying out 
their duties face three years in 
prison, notwithstanding that the 
alleged conspirators were at most 
conspiring to encourage people 
to commit misdemeanors.
Needless to say, the conspi
racy indictments here in Iowa 
City are further examples of the 
expanding repression that already 
reaches from Oakland to Boston 
The particular threat of the Iowa 
City case is that if the charges 
are sustained, collective acts of 
civil disobediance are, in effect, 
prohibited. This would severely 
limit the expression of moral op
position to the war.
Douglas H. McCay, area co
ordinator of Resist, has asked for 
national contributions for the de
fense of the Iowa City "conspir
ators. Mr. Allaire has done 
everything he can to raise money 
at the local level, but he needs 
our heip if eight men are to avoid 
the suffering of three years in 
prison. Financial and moral sup
port may be routed to the Iowa 
group through RESIST. Room 4.

Anarchy or Responsibility
by Dale
By now, mast students should' 
be searching for answers to 
questions directly concerning 
their future on this camipus. The 
first question we should be ask
ing is, Who can do more for 
CemegieiMelon students  
SCORE or Student Govern
ment?
The (answer lies in some prob
ing question that every student 
should have on his mind: What 
can Student Government do 
toward promoting the interersts 
of the students, and what are 
the limitations of student pow
er? What should be the meth
odology of Student Government 
in accomplishing its objectives? 
And what can you as students 
do?
To take these one at a time 
and attempt to offer some re
sponsible solution, let us ex
amine the first questionWhat 
can Student Government do, 
and what are the limits of its 
power? There is now an obvi
ous need for changes in cam
pus administration. Student 
Government represents the only 
possibility of organizing these 
changes  where changes in 
campus administration include 
changes in the library and book
store hours, incorporation of 
new calendars and exam-study 
days, and the realization of 
housing improvements. (George 
Madaras letter-to-the-editor in 
last weeks Tartan listed more 
possibilities, but the list is in
finite.) Student Government is 
also, the only mefans for stu
dents to establish policy, weth
er it be political, social or what
ever.
The limits of student power 
are, at this point, boundless. Stu
dent Government can, with stu
dent support and corporation, 
bring albout tany conceivable 
change as long as that change 
represents actual student inter
est. If Student Government is 
staffed by responsible people 
and run efficiently, it can do 
anything toward fulfilling stu
dent needs, once these needs 
are identified.
The next question is ovibdous, 
but all too often left unanswer
edWhat should be the meth
odology? One means to achieve 
the stated ends is simply to 
act: Make a statement or effect 
a change! Then, if students are 
so offeneded by the action that 
they make their opinions pub
lic, their ideas and energies can 
be incorporated toward includ
ing their interests. Another, but 
more subtle, method would be 
tor Student Government to iden
tify less with the administration 
and more with the students. It 
is a recognized organizational 
tactic to incorporate opposition 
in higher, authoritarian groups
Prof. Ford Talks 
On South Africa
Dr. Richard Ford, assistant 
professor of history, who is just 
back from eight months in South 
Africa, will talk on his experi
ences tomorrow at 12:30 in the 
Wherrett Room. Prof. Fords 
comments will deal with the 
other side of South Africas 
would image than the one com
monly seen in the press. Every
one is invited to attend this 
event in the Ys Thursday 
Luncheon Forum and to bring 
his lunch if desired.
Peschel
and thereby alter the opposi
tions norms. If student leaders 
(particularly the president) sit 
on fewer administrative com
mittees, they will be freer to 
identify with, and promote stu
dent interests.
With the above points in 
mind, what should be the course 
of action of the students? It is 
Student Government, and allow 
and encourage it to change, but 
hold itparticularly its leaders 
 responsible for accomplish
ing its stated objectives. Then, 
at some later date such as mid
year, review the degree of suc
cess or failure of Student Gov
ernment in meeting its propos
als. If Student Government does 
not show significance toward 
adequate student representation, 
the entire concept should be destryoed and foundations for a 
new system executed. Finally, 
it is the responsibility of the stu
dent body to carefully review 
and evaluate the qualifications 
of the candiddates, and then se
lect the person who will do the 
most for promoting the student 
interest on this campus.
Anarchy is not the answer. 
It promotes no-ones interest, 
and it allows for the effective 
takeover of isolated power cen
ters on this campus. With 
SCORE, students would only be 
in a position to yield to Admin
istrative policy. With Student 
Government, students have the 
means for affecting and create 
ing administrative policy. An
archy is now being tried on such 
campuses as Columbia and Cor
nell. The result is that the voice 
of 10 or 12 students is simply 
ignored. Unless those 10 or 12 
people can identify with aunified body of interest, they will 
be ignored here, too! That uni
fied body of interest is Student 
Government. Support it!
RESIST Asks Support 
for Iowa Dissenters
Thd anti-war movement in Colu*nbus, Ohio has issued an appeal 
for support in the face of har
assment and intimidation by their 
local Minutemen, the local police 
and judiciary, ahd a hostile pop
ulace.
Several people were arrested 
last month in a number of dem
onstrations agaihst military and 
Dow recruiters on campus. They 
(almost all were students) were 
charged with trespassing, arraig
ned before a notorious anti-com
munist judge who insulted them 
in court, and released on heavy 
bonds of $500 each.
One leader of Columbus peace 
activities, David Travers, a philos
ophy grad student at OSU, has 
been repeatedly threatened by 
MinuMinutemen death threats. Ti 
vers was recently arrested and 
charged with contempt of court 
for smoking in a court room while 
appearing as a witness for the 
abovd arraignment. Returning 
home that evening, Travers was 
shot at from a police car wait

SONNEBORN
The Society of the Sigma Xi 
will sponsor a public lecture 
with Dr. Tracy M. Sonneborn, 
Sigma Xi National Lecturer for 
1968 and Distinguished Service 
Professor, Department of Zoo
logy, Indiana University speak
ing on Biology Today and To
morrow at a meeting to be held 
on Friday, April 5, 1968 at 4:30 
pm in the Scaife Hall of Engi
neering, Oarnegie-Mellon U n iversity.
Dr. Sonneborn was educated 
at John Hopkins University. His 
many honors include an Sc.D 
degree from Johns Hopkins, the 
Cleveland Research Prize of the 
American Association for the 
Kinbler Genetics Medal and 
Award of the National Academy 
of Sciences, the Mendel Centen
nial Medal of the Czechoslovak 
Academy of Sciences, Presidencyof several professional socities (Amer. Soc. Zool., Amer. 
Soc. Naturalists, Genetics Soc. 
of Amer. Inst. Biological Scien
ces), membership in the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, and 
most recently (1964) election 
as Foreign Member of the Roy
al Society of London.
Working with the unicellular 
animal Paramecium, Dr. Sonne
born born and his students were 
enabled to discover and analyze 
a number of mechanism of 
genic control and cytoplasmic 
inheritance with have become 
widely known models in these 
fields which still continue to 
lead to fruitful investigation in 
his and other laboratories. Re
cently, he edited a book, The 
Control of Human Heredity and 
Evolution, which attempts to 
assess the bearing of Classical 
and coiecular genetics on the 
possibility of Mans control of 
his own biological future.
Dr. Sonneborn has provided 
the following abstract of his 
talk:
Drawing in part upon the 
findings of coiecular biology, in 
part upon the findings of cel
lular bioiogyincluding studies 
from my own labortory, and in 
part upon the findings of organismic and papulation biolo
gy, I propose to examine some 
of the advances of current bio
logy and their major import for 
the future of biology and Man. 
Among the more important 
points to be stressed are the 
generality of the discovery that 
progressively higher units of 
structure and function are com
posed of repeating identical or 
similar lower units of structure 
and function; and the correlated 
finding that each level of struc
ture and function has its own 
distinctive methodolgy and prin
ciples. Finally, I shall discuss 
the significance of these and 
other points for the future of 
biology and for the controver
sial subject of the possibility of 
Mans control of his own func
tioning, Herdity, and evolution 
by biological engineering and 
genetic surgery.
Anthropologist Mead 
Advises Marriage
Anthropologist Margaret 
Mead, who recently advocated 
Marriage in two steps, today 
declared reaction to her plan 
presented a dilemma and that 
it was unsatisfactory at pres
ent, because young people are 
clamoring for a few morality 
that will put a seal of approval 
on premarital sex.
The need is urgent to rethink 
our traditional approach to mar
riage, Dr.Mead wrote in the 
current isisue of Redbook.
Young people are not asking 
for the right to be deliquent; 
they are asking that the stigma 
of deliquency be removed alto
gether. They have read the 
books that tell them sex is good 
and necessary for a well-bal
anced life.
Almost two years ago, Dr. 
Mead proposed the development 
of two forms of marriage. One, 
which she termed individuai, 
involved no children, and its 
limited economic responsibilities 
would be easy to end. The 
ather, parental, would be a 
second step by couples ready 
to undertake the lifetime obli
gations of parenthood.
It now seems clear to me 
that neither elders or young 
people want to make a change 
to two forms of marriage, she 
said. They want to reserve the 
word marriage for a commit
ment they they can feel is per
manent and final, no matter 
how often the actual marriages 
may fail.
Young people dont want to 
compromise their future, espe
cially the future of tihe boys, by 
a grueling domesticity too soon. 
They are increasingly willing to 
wait for marriage, but they no 
longer understand why they 
must wait for sex.
Dr. Meads present advice to 
them: You had better get legal
ly married.
It is the earnest and respon
sible young people who are re
questing sex freedom with a 
single, chosen lover who pres
ent the dilemma, she said. As 
thfe president of one of our best 
coeducational colleges phrased 
it to me: Its the good girls 
who want us to approve their 
receiving boys in their rooms. 
The bad girls have found the 
answer long ago, in the park
ing lot at the other end of town.
Dr. Mead said she discovered 
during discussion with young 
people that in their eyes, mar
riage is meaningless without 
children. The idea of a cherish
ing relationship between two in
dividuals through marriage 
does not ppeal to them. Argu
ments about protecting unborn 
children are not very real to 
them.
Before marriage, uninstitu
tionalized sex relations  com
panionship, as they see itor, 
for the religious and conserva
tive, decorous waiting, is appro
priate.
 Why get married? they 
ask. Why cant we simply live 
together until we are ready to 
get married? Contraception is 
being wronged; no girls honor 
wiill be ruined; no young man, 
his education unfinished, will 
be trapped into marriage.
So parents and advisers, 
teachers and clergy, are in a 
quandary . . . they say one 
thing out loud, one thing from 
the rostrum and the pulpit; and 
privately they sympathize, con
done and connive to give partic
ular young people the happiness 
they are demiNading, Dr. Mead 
wrote.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES
ROBERT GEBBIA
To express my ideas about stu
dent government would take much 
more space than permitted here; 
however I would like to take this 
opportunity to briefly make my
feelings known. In the past much 
criticism has developed over the 
effectiveness of Student Govern
ment. The main source for this in
effectiveness can be attributed di
rectly to the lack of interest of 
many of those involved in Student 
Government. It is indeed difficult 
for a group to inspire students to 
participate in the various activi
ties on campus or act even in their 
own behalf if the leadership of the 
student body shows a lacidasical 
attitude. This year student govern
ment has its greatest hope of ob
taining senators which are inter
ested for this is the first year there 
are many more candidates than 
positions. It is my belief that 
achieving a n effective Student 
Government is not a goal quickly 
accomplished this is the year to 
start.
I believe that in instituting a 
few changes and activating some 
of the already formed groups
within Student Government we 
can make our climb out of the 
quagmire of ineffectiveness.
1) Student government has an 
obligation to the social and aca
demic well-being of the student 
body. Most of its activities have 
dealt in the social affairs of the 
student but little has been done in 
the academic area. I believe that 
the Academic Affairs Committee 
already organized within Student 
government can better express the 
needs of the students. I propose 
that the committee select a de
partment within the university 
and institute an intensive study 
by personal contact with the stu
dent in the department if the stu
dent desires for new courses or 
improvement of old courses. By 
working with the faculty in the
department and informing them 
of new ideas some positive gain 
may be realized.
2) As for the general lack of 
communication between student, 
administration, and student gov
ernment. a program of approach
ing various groups on campus to 
explore the ideas and gripes with
in these groups. I also believe the 
president should attend all senate 
meetings to keep up with the hap
penings as well as sentiments 
within that group. I also believe 
in the president attending, when 
ever possible, committee meet
ings to again stay well informed.
3) I believe the few social 
events in the manner of big week
ends held on this campus should 
in every way be as good as pos
sible. In the past we have had 
much criticism of poor entertain
ment. Those in charge of plan
ning the weekend say it is due to 
lack of funds. The administration 
supposedly diverts part of our tution to activities on campus. I pro
pose a study of how much of this

I have no intention of haran
guing the student body about the 
past inefficiencies of student gov
ernment or about the apathy
involved. I want merely to pre
sent a positive program of things 
which can and will be done should 
I be elected.
The library whould be open 
longer on Saturday and earlier on 
Sunday-effective immediately. 
Arrange to have the first floor 
open all night-effective by the 
end of next semester.
2. Each semester students have 
papers, test, etc. due up until the 
day before final examinations 
which allows no time for review 
and study. Therefore, there should 
be at least a two day reading periid before exams start-effective by 
the end of next semester.
3. The gymnasium should be 
open on Sundays and for longer 
hours on Saturdayeffective be
fore the end of this year.
4. Engineering and Margaret Mor
rison students have often com
plained that the number of fine 
arts courses that they can take is 
severely restricted and vice versa 
This leads to a narrow student 
body and therefore, the scope of 
exchangeable courses should be 
broadened.
To encourage this exchange of 
courses every student should be 
permitted to take at least one 
course a semester on a pass-fail 
basis-effective by the end of next 
year
5. On most campuses the bookstore 
is open on Saturdays or at least 
on Sat. mornings. This should be 
the case on our campus-effective 
by the beginning of next year.
6. The average Tech. engineer or 
Morewood freshman has little 
chance to meet members of the 
opposite sex. A partial answer 
would be an integrated dining 
hall-effective by the end of next 
year.
7. The schools loco parentis is out 
moded on our campus. The threat 
of expulsion should not hang over 
female students who violatd the 
administrations moral code. All 
students should be premitted to 
choose their own moral standards 
-effective by the end of next 
semester.
MIKE SMOLENS
The major issue involved in the 
upcoming student elections is that 
of who is in charge of the univer
sity. There are three answers to 
this question: the administration, 
the faculty, and the students. Pre
sently, with the administration 
controlling such issues as in loco 
parentis, and many curriculum 
problems, it appears that the ad
ministration is in charge. Thus, 
to use Hegelian terminology 
what we now have is a thesis, a 
quagmire of students and faculty 
striving for academic and moral 
freedom to pursue their own 
goals, and an antithesis, the ad
ministration, who try to set limits 
and define these goals for the 
students. Hence, what is the re
sulting synthesis? ----Nothing.
This concept must be changed.
The students should be one of 
the instrumental forces in decis
ions made about the academic en
vironment in which they, along 
with the faculty, play the only 
roles. The administration should 
not enter into policy-making.
The faculty, who in addition to 
their role as teachers do extensive 
research, should also appear out
side the classroom where the stu
dents can get to know them as 
people. A system such as Yales 
fellow system, where faculty 
members dine and sometimes live 
in the same housing as the stu
dents would be an excellent op
portunity to start an out - of - the 
- classroom relationship between 
the students and the faculty.
Concurrent with making this dis
tinction between the academic 
community and the administration, 
the student government should 
free itself from the burdensome 
pursestrings of Warner Hall. The 
method for doing this is to have 
a $10.00 per year student activ
ities fee to be matched by a sim
ilar contribution from the admin
istration (the amount presently) 
given each year) to provide a 
working capital of about $70,000.00 
per year. In addition to the im
mediate financial autonomy this 
would give to the student govern
ment, such events as concerts, 
speakers on both sides of pertin
ent issues, and greatly reduced 
yearbook prices could be sched
uled.
As for the structure of student 
government, let it remain as it is 
with the replacement of some of 
the present Senate seats by spec
ial interest group representatives, 
as well as with the addition of 
graduate students to the Senate. 
This would enable the entire stu
dent community to be represen
ted in issues which concern every 
student. If last years government 
had stopped trying to find an iden
tity and started to use some of its 
inherent powers to act, there 
would have been many changes on 
the campus. The important issue 
is not the structure of student gov
ernment; it is the program outlined by each candidate for act
ion. If a President is to be ef
fective. he can accomplish his pro
grams with any structure, if he 
would only use the structure.
From the concept of a untied 
academic community can stem 
such changes as the abolition of 
in loco parentis interference on 
the part of the administration, and 
in this place come a realization 
that college co-eds should have 
the right to go where, with 
whom, and whenever they wish. 
For an administration to impose 
its moral standards on the students 
is as bad as an administration tel
ling a professor how to structure 
his courses.
In the area of acadenic affairs, 
there are presently four students 
on Dr. Schatzs Academic Af
fairs Committee, yet none of them 
have the right to vote. The stu
dents MUST have a strong say in 
their curriculum, and an effec
tive student-faculty team can give 
this to them. If. for example, the 
administration is so concerned about the morality of the student, 
why havent they offered a 
course in sex education, or the 
uses and misuses of birth con
trol pills. In this same vein of 
academic affairs, if students have 
complaints about such minor 
things as their department being 
cancelled, (ie Biology), this strong 
academic affairs group of student 
government can be the channel 
through which complaints are 
aired. As of now. this channel 
does not exist.
Another aspect of academic af
fairs is the calendar. CMU has as 
many calendar days per semester 
as any university in the country, 
75. The average number of days 
is 67, with some schools having 
classes only 60 days per semester. 
With this in mind, we need to 
change the educational nightmare
of leaving school for a Christmas 
vacation, to only have to worry 
about coming back to another 
week of assignments, and then 
finals. Instead, if we could end 
finals before Christmas and have 
three week combined break, this 
would enable the students to have 
a two week Spring Break, giving 
us a chance to go further away 
from Pittsburgh than Mt. Wash
ington before we must head back 
to school. The beginning of school 
would be after Labor Day, and 
the end would still be in mid May. 
This calendar has been proposed 
many times in the past, but with 
NO student vote in the commit
tee nothing has been done. The 
Students must demand the right 
to have an equal say with the fac
ulty on the calendar. The admin
istration, on the other hand, should 
only be concerned that the requir
ed number of class days are ac
counted for, and should bave no 
voice whatsoever in when these 
days are placed on the calendar.
Certain members of the admin
istration has said that the student 
activities are games, or models of 
real life situations. Are we. the 
students, paying over $12,000.00 for 
a piece of paper that says we can
play games?i Hundreds of thou
sands of our contemporaries are 
in Vietnam playing a more ser
ious game, that of life and death. 
And yet this campus has not stood 
up and said it is time to quit play
ing games, and start asking the re
levant questions. Who am I? or 
 Why am I here while my best 
friend is in Vietnam getting kil
led? These are questions which 
must be asked within the frame
work of the academic world, and
money is suppose to be allocated 
and what the financial needs of 
the activities on campus actually 
are so that the necessary steps can 
be taken such as the initation of 
a student activity fee.
4) The possibility of having a 
winter weekend has been proposed 
but nothing has been done. I be
lieve it would be a good addition 
to the social life of the students 
of this campus and should be fur
ther investigated.
5) Finally I think we should 
look further into the internal struc
ture of student government and 
chop out the dead wood.
8. The mens dormitories on our 
campus are atrocious. Long range 
plans should be initiated immedi
ately to remove the blight which 
stands in Tech. s dormitory areas.
9. Graduate students make up 
about one-fourth of the student 
body and should be given a chance 
to participate in student govern
ment - effective upon request by 
graduate students.
May I add that SCORE, the or
ganization for the abolition of stu
dent government, feels that spec
ial interest groups will emerge 
on campus to confront the admin
istration. directly. In my opinion 
student government can and will 
be that special interest group con
fronting the administration ef
fectively on all student issues.

Mocnlc9Mu s16Mc2 We n2e V2,c9cM,ch
group, be it the Foreign Policy 
Forum, or the Chess Club, some 
of these issues can clear up.
When an important issue arises 
that infringes on the freedom of 
the educational community, im
mediate. strong action must be 
taken by the joint forces of the 
students and the faculty to insure 
academic autonomy from the ad
ministration. If nothing else works, 
the threat of any adverse publicity 
in the Pittsburgh news media can 
jolt the administration to expedite 
student matters. This type of pres
sure is admittedly drastic, but if 
the student - faculty team has a 
need which cannot be met with 
diplomatic means, other action 
has to be taken.
In conclusion, I would like to 
establish an academic community 
on this campus, run BY the stu
dents and the faculty; and have 
this community control affairs 
which are related to the endea
vors of its members. This will es
tablish financial, political, and 
moral autonomy from the admin
istration This then would be a 
campus which can proudly say. 
My students enhance my educa
tion.

During the past week, many 
people have approached mem
bers of SCORE for an explana
tion of that organizations rai
son detre and rationale. What 
What follows here will, it is 
hoped, provide one mans ex
planation of his feelings on the 
matter.
At this time, our institution 
is considered to be a miniature 
state. It isnt. It is a business, 
and not a miniature business, 
either, producing undergrad
uates, graduates, and research.
That distinction should cause 
one to ask how it could ever 
be expected for a senate and 
a president to have any place 
in a corporation. It appears 
that a survey of industry will 
indicate that we have created 
an anomaly.
Second, on the point of stu
dent activities having or not 
having the right to both have 
a share in the decision making 
process and to receive monies 
for activities, consider this point. 
We are supposedly a nonprofit 
making organization. But, in 
fact, we do make a profit. Stu
dents, as contributors to the 
making of a profit, have a right 
to be participants in the division 
of the residual profits of the 
firm.
The argument that, without 
Student Government, the Admin
istration will not provide funds 
for student activities is, to say 
the least, blatantly groundless. 
Dean Brown has stated that the 
administration is neutral and 
will recognize whatever group 
or groups the students desire 
to be their representatives. Dr. 
Schatz has stated that the abol
ition of Student Government 
would cause some problems ini
tially but that the Administra
tion would be able to adjust 
to a new system by next semes
ter. What would occur would 
be the following. The Adminis
tration would have to assign 
responsibility to various people 
to handle requests for funds or 
considerations for privileges. At 
present, o ur Administration 
functions as one big, happy fam
ily, which is disfunctional when 
it comes to clearcut decision 
making. Proposals for action 
seem to become lost in an al
most endless circuit of travel 
from desk to dejk. Stopping 
that pattern of activity will re
sult in a new wave of respon
sibility being spread throughout 
the administrative structure.
Responsibility also has great 
meaning for the student body. 
It seems that Carnegie-MeLlon 
University the student is per
mitted to realize his successes, 
but not his failures. How can 
one become responsible if he 
is continuously shielded from 
failure?
With the existance of Stu
dent Government, we have one 
more establishment which saves 
the student from realizing the 
consequences of his failures. If 
a group of students makes plans, 
for say, Spring Carnival, they 
make those plans with the full 
knowledge that they do not have 
to come up with a widely ap
pealing program since the ad
ministration will cover all loss
es.
The present program sanetions-yea, encourages  ineffi
ciency and incompetency. By 
not being responsible for our 
lailures, or subject to the con
sequences of those failures, we 
are trained to accept grossly 
suboptimal decisions. We are 
not subject to reality constraints.
And yet, this institution would 
have us and the world believe 
that we are being trained or 
educated to take our place in 
the real world. Now, admitted
ly, the optimal solution is not 
achieved in the real world. Most 
companies and organizations 
are satisficers, not optimisers. 
And yet, those organizations op
erate under the constraints of 
the real world. Most of their 
satisficing behavior is the re
sult of prohibitive dollar or 
time costs. I submit that such 
constrants would be beneficial 
for the students on this cam
pus well into their futures.
Now, let us consider the fol
lowing argument: Student Gov
ernment serves a function by 
allowing students to gain ex
perience in governing them
selves and learning to conduct 
their lives in an orderly fashion.
To answer this question, we 
must in part turn to the first 
point we considered, and make 
the following assertion. If we 
were training people to go in
to small town government, it 
would appear that mock sen
ates and discussions of parlia
mentary procedure would be 
highly functional. However, we 
are not, in the main, operating 
for such a. purpose. Instead, we 
are producing products which 
are used in business, and the 
last thing most businesses turn 
to is a Senate.
Instead, most businesses and 
governments are run by pres
sure groups, and the man who 
wants a raise or a new carpet 
for his officeor an office, for 
that matter, must learn to bar
gain with his boss. The sooner 
our undergraduates realize that, 
the better.
As for government, consider 
simply the size, number, and 
effectiveness of various lobbies 
in the Capital. The NRA has 
been successful in preventing 
any gun control legislation pass
ing in the congress. Unions 
have had a profound impact 
upon business legislation. So it 
appears that governments, too, 
owe their directon to pressure 
groups.
The argument may be present
ed here that what the studnts 
should do, then, is become ac
tive in sending pressure groups 
to their government. This ar
gument is invalid for two rea
sons.
First, we have a false struc
ture here. The Student Govern
ment is not the final decision 
making body. They derive their 
power from th eadministration 
of this university. The United 
States government does not, for 
example, submit its legislation 
to the Canadians for approval. 
What is advocated by SCORE 
is the application of pressure 
to the group which makes the 
decisonsthe administrators of 
this university.
Even if one were to be able 
to present a convincing discus
sion which proved that Student 
Government is the group on 
which the pressure would be 
most aptly put, I would advance 
this statement. The student sen
ate, which is the elected body 
of Student Government, is al
most powerless in the face of 
a decree from the Executive 
Council, which need not be, in 
the final analysis, responsible 
to anyone.
Finally, a discussion of the 
accusations of anarchical ten 
dencies must be presented. I am
Score-A Real Game for CMU Students
by Diana Patterson
SCORE is an organization es
tablished pro tem in order to 
issue a referendum to the stu
dent body. The refenendum 
states that student government 
as it now exists does not rep
resent the students of CarnegieMellon University.
At present Student Govern
ment is caught up in the parliamentarianism of every issue. 
They absorb all that the stu
dents give to them and seldom 
make any proposal truly the 
responsibility of the Adminis
tration. Anyone who has a pro
posal or gripe he wishes to have 
acted upon is presently forced 
to bypass Student Government 
if he really wants to see any ac
tion taken while he is still a 
member of the student body. 
Student Government is then ask
ed to look at the proposal once 
it has gotten to the lower etchelon of deans. They may or not 
make some comment on the 
proposal. But the fact is that 
the only way the Administra
tion ever got to see the propos
al to begin with is that the stu
dent or organization did not 
submit it through the red tape 
bound Student Government.
Students on this campus be
lieve that Student Governments 
main task is to control Home
coming, Spring Carnival, and 
Greek Sing. This is false. These 
events are organized by commitees totally alienated from 
Student Government. They are 
for the most part self support
ing and do not even have to 
apply to Student Government 
for funds.
Student Government does 
however receive an allocation 
of funds from the Administra
tion every year so that they 
may in turn allocate the funds 
to other organizations. They do 
this with little efficiency, and 
no record is required by the 
Administration to indicate where 
the money goes. Homecoming, 
Sprng Carnival, Greek Sing, 
Scotch n Soda do not receive 
any money from Student Gov
ernment. Where does their 
money go?
SCORE does not propose to 
establish a new system to 
correct the present faults of 
Student Government. Instead, 
they advocate, or suggest the 
students continue to deal with 
the administration as they do 
now: individually. We are, ad
mittedly, a collection of special 
interest groups rather than a 
unified campus. SCORE feels 
that the best way for these spe
cial interest groups to be rep
resented is through themselves. 
They know best about their de
sires and needs. Presently, if 
they really wished to deal ef
fectively with the Administra
tion, they must go to them 
themselves and present their 
ideas.
not an acarchist. I have serv
ed as parliamenarian for too 
many groups for that to hold 
water. However, I do firmly 
believe that an attitudinal 
change is needed here, and that 
the abolition of an existing in
stitution is vital to the occurance of that attitudinal change.
From my point of view, a 
new structure will emerge with
in a month to two months aft
er the abolition of the Student 
Senate, Executive Council, and 
the present Student Court sys
tem.
However, that structure will 
be oriented toward the accom
plishment of a different task
SCORE only says that this 
should be made the official, 
recognized method of dealing 
with the administration. This 
is not something new and revo
lutionary, it happens all the 
time. It is only revolutionary 
that people are now beginning 
to realize that the Administra
tion is happy to deal with indi
vidual students and student 
groups, and that Student Gov
ernment has in the past played 
a very small role in the passing 
of important proposals on this 
campus.
Larger organizations on this 
campus feel that their propos
als will be undermined if 
SCORE Takes Over. SCORE 
does not plan any sort of take 
over. SCORE plans to disolve 
as soon as their goal is reach
ed, i.e., that individual groups, 
and the students themselves 
realize that the most effective 
way to deal with the adminis
tration is directly and that only 
the students themselves can best 
represent their own needs. 
SCORE is not out to stamp out 
the power of CFP. In fact the 
fraternities as a group and indi
vidually will be aided by a di
rect bargaining method of dealthan the Student Government, 
and as such will be quite a bit 
more efficient in the accomplish
ment of its goals. What I am 
saying is this. You may be able 
to impose the goals, i.e., bar
gaining with the administration 
over working conditions, upon 
the Student Government sys
tem. But the Student Govern
ment was not devised for that 
purpose.
Instead, if you undergo an 
attitudinal change and allow to 
evolve an organization which 
fits the goads, you will have 
achieved an exceedingly greater 
degree of efficiency.
As well, you will have proing with the Administrators.
The feelings, needs proposals, 
and attitues of every student, 
or group on campus will be more 
effectively represented. There 
will be no need for apathy on 
this campus once the students 
find out that they CAN do some
thing. And there will be less 
apathy on this campus once it 
is possible to do something 
without infinite hair. No one 
can be hurt by a direct con
frontation of the of the Admin
istration. It will be no change 
from the most effective portion 
of the present system. The only 
individuals who will lase any
thing are those who are pres
ently running for Student Gov
ernment seats, who will not be 
able to write on their job applicatios and graduate school 
forms; member of Student 
Government 1968-1969. To them 
we express our regret. But per
haps all of us will be able to 
note in our own list of aceamplishments; I did something 
to improve Carnegie - Mellon 
University. To those of you 
who will be able to say this 
once you can deal directly with 
out administration we express 
our joy!
SCORE.
duced an organizational struc
ture which will be necessarily 
flexible, as student needs change 
from hour to hour at times, 
and which will be necessarily 
representative, since a strong 
pressure group will always be 
able to upset a bargainer. In 
other words, bargainers will 
have to keep the desires of the 
student body uppermost in their 
minds, or they will be, present* 
ly, unseated as bargainers.
So, to the dismay of critics, 
Wanetik is not an anarchist. 
He is, instead, an organization 
man, if you will, but perhaps 
not your type of organization 
man.

Academic Affairs Committee
These are the minutes of the 
Academic Affairs Committee 
meeting held on March 11.
Dr. Schatz opened the meeting 
by introducing members of the 
Graduate Affairs Coordinating 
Committee, Draft Regulations 
and Their Effects on Graduate 
Students, Research and Teaching 
Loads.
The Presidents Executive Or
der 11360, ending deferments of 
graduate students excepth those 
in health sciences, has generated 
widespread anxiety and concern 
among colleges and universities. 
Predictions have been made that 
the new law will result in a sub
stantial reduction in graduate stu
dent enrollment. Since almost all 
universities rely heavily on graduate students as teaching and re
search assistants the consequences 
of this reduction could be quite 
serious.
The Executive Board of the 
Council of Graduate Schools in 
the US has adopted a position pa
per which recounts the possible 
immediate and long-range conse
quences for all of education, as 
well as for the industrial, eco
nomic, and social structure of the 
country as a whole. The position 
paper has been sent to every mem
ber of the Senate and the House 
of Representatives. The Council 
has requested its members to 
write to the Senators and Repre
sentatives of their District in sup
port of the position paper and to 
tell them how the regulation af
fects their own institutions.

After discussing the Councils 
position paper and recommenda
tions and the recommendations of 
the Graduate Affairs Committee, 
it was agreed that the following 
steps should be taken:
1. A committee will draft a let
ter which will be sent to the ap
propriate members of Congress, 
telling how the new regulation 
will affect CMUs graduate en
rollment. teaching loads, and re
search.
2. A policy statement which 
will delineate as clearly as pos
sible what the Universitys atti
tude will be towards students who 
make various choices in response 
to the present draft situation (i.e. 
readmission and refunding of tui
tion) is to be drafted with the aid 
of legal counsel.
3. Letters requesting deferments. to be sent to the local Draft 
Boards, will be drafted with the 
aid of legal counsel and will cov
er the following situations:
a. Teaching Assistant  student 
is in fact performing certain types 
of instructional activities for 
which he is receiving compensa
tion and could be considered for 
an occupational deferment.
b. Research Assistant  student 
is in fact engaged in research ac
tivities for which he is being com
pensated. As such he should be 
considered for an occupational de

Ferlinghetti To Read 
at Poetry Forum
The International Poetry Forum 
will present the distinguished Law
rence Ferlinghetti in a reading of 
his own poetry on Wednesday, 
April 3. 1968. at 8:30 P.M. in the 
Carnegie Music Hall. Oakland.
Mr. Ferlinghetti, after comple
ting his doctorate at the Sorbonne, 
settled in San Francisco where he 
and Peter D. Martin founded the 
first all paperbound bookstore in 
the country. City Lights. Under 
its imprint. Ferlinghetti began 
publishing the Picket Series which 
includes work by William Carlos 
Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth 
Patchen, Kenneth Rexroth, An
tonin Artuad, and many exciting 
new young writers whom he dis
covered.
Discrimination In 
Southern Draft
by Hank Mashburn
Many, if not most, of the draft 
and appeal boards in the South 
(and probably the North) are 
nearly totally segregated and 
biased against Negroes. In Ken
tucky and Texas, Negroes make up 
about seven per cent of the popu
lation but only 0.2 and 1.1 per 
cent, respectively of the members 
of draft boards. The Lousiville, 
Ky. draft board that orginally 
denied Muhammad Alis request 
for conscientious objector status 
has no Negro members, although 
Negroes constitute more than 
twenty precent of the citys pop
ulation. The situation is especial
ly bad in the cities where Ne
groes are a large segment of the 
population.
The American Civil Liberties 
Union has appealed three cases to 
Federal courts in the South charg
ing discrimination and exclusion 
in Alabama, Georgia, South Caro
lina, Kentucky, and Texas. In Muhammud Alis case, the ACLU 
maintains that the states of Ken
tucky and Texas have systematic
ally excluded Negroes from mem
bership in state Selective Service 
is too evident to be disputed. The 
fact that each local board is free 
to do almost as it pleases only con
fuses the situation and allows op
portunity for subtle discrimina
tion in assigning classifications 
and induction orders.
Draft boards also accept such 
"evidence as newspaper clip
pings sent in by super patriots. 
An example is the following ex
cerpt sent to Muhammad Alis 
draft board:
If the Theologian of Black 
Muslim power. Cassius Clay, if 
defered by the board in Louisviville, you watch what happens in 
Washington; we are going to do 
something if that board takes your 
boy and leaves him (Ali) home 
to doubltalk. (L. Mendel Rivers, 
chairman of the House Armed 
Services Comm, speaking to the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. Aug. 
25.1966)
As the ACLU states in Alis ap
peal . . . The existence of so 
much prejudicial matter before 
the boards, comprised of men who 
are not trained in the law but who 
are charged with remaining im
partial. who desire anonymity and 
who could not have found (except 
tor newspaper clippings and let
ters) a basis in fact for denial of
appellants requests, must have re
sulted in prejudice to the appelFerlinghettis second book of 
poems. A Coney Island of the 
Mind, which was published i n 
1958. may well be the best selling 
poetry volume of our time. It is 
now going into its 16th printing, 
with a quarter million copies in 
print so far. A novel. Her, was 
published in 1960, and is now in 
its seventh printing.
Among his other works are Start
ing from San Francisco and Pic
tures of the Gone World, both 
books of poetry, and. Routines 
and Unfair Arguments with Exis
tance, both ventures into uncon
ventional, revolutionary theatre.
Lawrence Ferlinghetti has giv
en many poetry readings both in 
this country and abroad, includ
ing the Spoleto Festival, the Ber
lin Literary Colloquin, and the 
historic poetry evening at the 
Royal Albert Hall in London. He 
has written film scripts for avantgarde productions and recorded 
his poetry for the Fantasy label. 
His plays have been widely pro
duced in College theaters.
Tickets for Mr. Ferlinghettis 
reading are now available at Gimbels, Kaufmanns, Hornes and the 
University of Pittsburgh Student 
Union. For any additional infor
mation, contact the International 
Poetry Forum office at Carnegie 
Library. Oakland, 621-9893.
lant.
The fact that local boards are 
segregated, and that evidence 
such as above is ever allowed to 
become part of a persons file, 
much less to be considered real 
evidence, demonstrates that a bias 
is being consistently applied to 
Negroes -- a bias that is seldom 
uncovered unless the person in
volved is a public figure such as 
Mhammad Ali who can command 
publicity for his cause.
Lt. Col. P.J. Accourti 
Retiring from Staff
Pittsburgh, Pa., March 8, 1968 
Lt. Col. Peter J. Accorti, assis
tant professor of military science 
in Carnegie-Mellon Universitys 
Reserve Officer Training Corps 
(ROTC) program, will retire from 
the Army on April 1, after more 
than 22 years on active duty.
Colonel Accorti, 47. will become 
president of Fanning Personnel of 
Washington, D. C., a personnel 
placement agency.
A 1950 graduate of CarnegieMellon University (then known 
as Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology). he has been at his alma 
mater as an ROTC professor since 
1965.
He is a member of the Armys 
Corps of Engineers.
During World War II Colonel 
Accorti served in the Pacific war 
zone for 30 months. He was one 
of five Army officers serving with 
the Navys Underwater Demoli
tion Teams, better known as frog
men.
His unit was training to plant 
explosives on the coast of Japan in 
preparation for the Allied invas
ion of the islands when the atomic 
bomb was dropped, leading to the 
end of the war.
Counseling Service 
for Draft Questions
With the increased pressures 
from the draft, many students 
have expressed a need for current 
information about Selective Ser
vice procedures. To answer this 
need, several students have ban
ded to provide a draft counseling 
service for the CMU campus.
The counseling service will be 
oriented towards supplying infor
mation about all alternatives to 
military service. Information on 
immigration to Canada and The 
Resistance will be supplied if re
quested.
Available in the afternoons and 
evenings, the counselors are: Gary 
Aiken, Psychology Dept., x489, Ed 
Fuller, Comp. Sci. (P.H.), x 842; 
Hank Mashburn, Psychology 
Dept., x323; John Parkman, Psy
chology Dept., x 489.
Students are encouraged to dis
cuss any draft questions which 
they might have now, before they 
are confronted with more severe 
time pressures.
House Rep. Takes 
Issue With Hershey
Rep. Richard Schweiker (R., Pa.) 
has taken issue with Lt. Gen. Lew
is B. Hershey, director of Selec
tive Service on the latters order 
that deferred registrants should 
be inducted immediately if they 
participate in anti-draft demon
strations.
In an exchange of letters with 
executive director Spence Coxe, 
Schweiker declared that I whole 
heartedly disapprove of the ideas 
of using induction into the armed 
forces as a punishment for those 
who oppose the draft in this way. 
I certainly feel that a citizens 
right of free speech and expres
sion must be preserved, as long 
as, in exercising those rights, the
individual acts within the law. If
a person acts outside the law. . . .
then it is up to the appropriate
authorities to take action against
him.

I tell you, weve got to stop 
this treason, and by God, we've 
stopped it in Alabama. Any Ala
bama student who takes the ex
treme line - like sending blood 
and money to the Vietcong, or 
burning his draft card, or urging 
our troops not to fight - well expell the sons-of-bitches. And that 
goes for any professors who want 
us to lose the war in Vietnam. 
Academic freedom ! Goddam, 
they talk about academic free
dom, and tenure, and accrediation. 
They got the college presidents 
scared to death. I'd like to fire a 
few of them professors for at least 
one day.

MORNINGS AT SEVEN... AND 
THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT
Any man who says morning is the best time of day is 
either a liar or a meadow lark.
There is only one way to make morning enjoyable: 
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to 
make morning Myuh81:uhw This, I am pleased to report, is 
possible if you will follow three simple rules:
pw GT1th v8yvh8ulw
By shaving properly I mean shaving ;crhMulw Dont use 
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time 
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor 
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no 
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on 
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna 
Super Stainless Steel Blades.
I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive 
until one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here 
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not 
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna 
does not rasp and tug, yelling, Hey, lookit me! No, sir, 
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It 
shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble. 
Why, you hardly know its there, this well-bred Personna 
blade, this paragon of punctilio.
Moreover, this crown of the blade-makers art, this 
epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double
edge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get 
some.
Hw E8h1m61M v8yvh8ulw
I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible 
shaves. But I do ,yM assert that a Personna shave, brac
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the 
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an 
ample breakfast.
Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph
omore at YM.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec
tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would 
not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of 
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter, 
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a 
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.
The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When 
the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that 
he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He 
was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today, 
a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander 
in Cleveland.
Yw Ph12 v8yvh8ulw
Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting. 
But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acidmaking news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper 
the Home and Garden section, for example.
For instance, in my local paper, RTh khMvy8M 7h11,Mg 
there is a delightful column called Ask Harry Homespun which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and 
many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and 
answers:

Letters - from pg. 3
there stopped her typing to turn 
and look at me. I asked, Did 
someone have an accident while 
making the salad this morning?
Yes! was her answer, and sur
prised she was, too, to learn that 
I knew. I showed her the napkin 
and its contents. She tested its 
consistency with her forefinger, 
and called Steve Bucko on the 
phone. As it happened, a lady had 
sliced a good chunk of her finger
tip off that morning. (Gossip has 
it her name is Gertrude, and that 
at this writing, she is still in the 
hospital. The fact of the finger
tip, however, is not gossip!) When 
we finally brought the specimen 
to Mr. Bucko, he asked me if I 
had received a refund on the sal
ad. I told him that I was on con
tract. He then said that such a 
thing was difficult to control be
cause it dealt with the .. . hu
man element. He pocketed the 
specimen, and I left. Well, when 
the human element ends up in 
mysalad, in my mouth, it is time 
to speak out!
I respectfully request the fol
lowing:
1. An investigation into the man
ner of supervision that exists in 
the kitchen;
2. Proof that the comfort and well 
being of the student are consider
ed important;
3. A satisfactory explanation of 
how Gertrudes fingertip ended up 
in my mouth.
4. Satisfactory proof that the 
conditions which permitted this 
to happen no longer exist.
If the University will not insti
gate this investigation, then I shall 
have to ask the public health peo
ple to do it. I believe that the 8th 
of April, 1968. is far enough away 
to allow sufficient time for this 
to be accomplished.
Very sincerely yours.

Civilized AttackWithin Structure
Editor, the Tartan:
To give the benefit of the 
dou'bt to the proponents of S.C.
O.R.E. (thedell foe pie in the 
sky by and by), it Should be 
pointed out that April 1st is 
rap.idly approaching. If the pur
pose of S.C.O.R.E. is to create 
student interest, dispel apathy, 
and provoke discussion, then I 
applaud its idea and its tim&g 
after all, Student Government 
elections are only a couple of 
weeks away.
On the other hiand, if S.C.- 
O.R.E. is seriouis in its avowed 
purpose I fear for the state 
of mind of several supposedly 
responsible students on this 
campus.
In any society, no matter 
where, when, or how, there must 
be a power structure. I cant 
say why this is, but any soci
ologist will bear it out. Be it bas
ed on force or democracy, there 
is some sort of structure. As 
man became more civilized he 
came away from rule of the 
strongest individual to rule of 
the strongest group and even
tually, to be fair, to rule of the 
majority tempered by the min
ority. He set up his laws and 
works within them.
S.C.O.R.E. advocates abolition 
of Student Government. To do 
this it proposes a referendum to 
be held separate from any gov
ernment affiliation and it ex
pects this referendum to be 
binding. Nothing could be furth
er from the truth. Student Gov
ernment is set up so that elec
tions are determined by the 
number of students voting. Even 
if 4,000 students vote to abolish 
the government in the referen
dum and only 10 students vote 
in the elections, those 10 will de
cide Student Government, which 
the administration will still recoognize. This is silly, especially 
since no more than 250 signa
tures on a petition are required 
to hold a sanctioned referendum 
which will be binding. Student 
Government has within it the 
seeds of its own abolition, if
S.C.O.R.E. would only bother
to water them. But they refuse 
to work with your bloody con
stitution.
Now, if S.C.O.R.E.s program 
were to go into effect, what 
would you have? A closer rap
port between Students and ad
ministration? Any individual 
whos tried to argue his way 
around a campus regulation 
knows the futility of this. Fiine, 
says S.C.O.R.E., get up a pe
tition and make the administra
tion listen to you. But then, 
where is the efficiency S.C.O.R.- 
E. speaks of? 25 signatures for 
Senator aire hard enough to get, 
much less however many are 
needed to talk to the administra
tion. And who will decide that 
number?
Anywiay, now weve got a 
group whos used blunt force to 
get the administration to do 
things their way. Will they now 
break up? Perhaps, and per
haps theyll organize  presto, 
another Student Government, 
but without any constitution to 
define it or give protection. A 
power structure will airways ap
pear.
Rather, one should work with
in the existing structure. But 
look at the American Revolu
tion, cries S.C.O.R.E., they 
didnt and they certainly could 
have. Perhaps; theres nothing 
that says that the American 
Revolution was right, but at
least the revolutionaries had 
something constructive with 
Which to replace the Empire. In 
fact, they wernt complaining 
about the lack of government as 
much as about too much govern
ment. S.C.O.R.E., on the oother 
hand, complains that Student 
Government does nothing, and 
yet advocates Nothing to re- ^ 
place it. To paraphrase the Tar
tan editorial of last week or sio, 
why dont those who complain 
about the government get in 
and do soomething about it?
My attitude has been called 
concervative. Rather, I would 
call it civilized. Theres no need 
for impetuous revolt, especially 
when the way is open to do 
things legally. In as much as an- ^ 
archy and individualism were 
the first forms of society, per
haps S.C.O.R.E. could be said 
to be very reactionary.

SG Ineffective, but 
Structure Is Needed
It is with great enthusiasm * 
that I greet Mr. Paynes propos
ed abolition of Student Cong
ress. The inadequacies of that 
body I need not repeat lest I 
should be redundant. However,
I am in great disagreement with 
the structure or rather the lack 
of structure and the intent of 
SCORE. Responsibility cannot 
be forced upon the individual.
Mr. Payne is a deluded ideal
ist when he believes that some
thing as unstructured as SCORE 
can achieve the intended end.
His idealism borders on fanat
icism in his haste to abolish 
the only form of government on 
this campus. There is something 
more basic than organizational 
theory that Mr. Payne fails to 
realize when he calls for the ~ 
abolition of Student Congress.
A government is necessary. 
Student Congress has to be ab
olished because its own Consti
tution, its bureaucracy, and its 
image prevent any meaningful 
changes to come about in this 
body. SCORE on the other hand 
does not create a new form of 
government. 0
In a community, even of the 
size of the C-MU campus, a 
government is necessary. By the 
word government I mean a 
group of elite, who with a cor
responding bureaucracy execute 
the interests of the community. 
Being able to look at the com
munity as a wholle, the govern
ment performs the important 
function of establishing priori- 0 
ties which it then can imple
ment and execute by its author
ity. The legitimacy and responsi
bility of the government is in
creased by a democratic process 
of election and an interested 
electorate. Thus the student gov
ernment decides that Spring 
Carnival is more important than 
the Science Fiction Club and 
gives it a higher priority.
By these standards Student 
Congress does not qualify as a 
government because, while it 
does establish priorities, it does 
not have real authority and it 
lacks popular support to make 
it the legitimate spokesman of 
student interests.
SCORE does not offer a solu
tion. I seriously question Mr. < 
Paynes hypothesis that a suit
able government will emerge 
from the anarchy that results 
in the absence of government.
How will priorities be estab
lished under SCORE?
Few will question the desir
ability of Spring Carnival or 
Homecoming but many are ig
norant of the advantages and 
the operation of small organiza- ^ 
tions like the Science Fiction 
Club or the Flying Club. Ac
cording to Mr. Payne, any or
ganization regardless of size,
say,Mr,ch2 y, 719h 11)
In a couple of 
months, youve got 
a date with the big,

membership, or benefit to the 
campus is entitled to confront 
the administration with requests 
for similar financial priviledges.
The condition of anarchy re*- 
suiting in the absence of gov
ernment will make It easier for 
he administration to suppress 
*tudent movements.
petitioning the administration 
is one way of legitimizing claims, 
but it is a cumberstone process. 
Furthermore, petitions by in
dividual organizations empha
size the subservience of the stu
dent body to the administration. 
Every time money or permission 
is needed by an organization it 
fvould have to go begging to 
the administration which could 
postpone, dilute oir reject the re
quest. Few organizations on 
campus represent majority in
terests. Pressure groups lay ilsupport. On these grounds the 
administration can question the 
validity of requests.
SCORE creates a condition of 
Anarchy that the administration
'Wants.
C The real enemy of the student 
lis not Student Congress but 
the administration. Student 
Congress has been rendered in
effective because it submitted 
to regulation and pressure from 
the 'administration; therefore 
what SCORE should work for 
% a stronger student govern
ment that can challenge the 
authority of the administration.
In closing I would like to 
express my wish to cooperate 
with Mr. Payne and other inter
ested students to work toward 
this end.

^core Silly, Where 
Is Greek Coverage?
In the springtime the studentsinterests sometimes turn 
from the academic to silly things 
like water battles and panty 
raids. But by far the silliest 
thing the spring has produced 
 lan organization calling itself 
sCORE.
It seems that Mr. Wanetik, 
from his extensive readings in 
Time, Moderator, and other 
knowledgeable sources, has dis
covered that it is the In Thing 
to have a Campus Revolt, so 
Carnegie, too, must have one of 
its very own. So he gathers to
other a small group of selfroclaimed intellect uals, Vietniks, and sundry malcontents, 
so that they might hold a refer
endum among the apathetic stu
dents and overthrow the Stu
dent Government. And Lennie 
procds to fill up the Tartan 
with his call for anarchy.
Such strange emanations 
jvere not totally unexpected 
" cm this bastion of journalistic 
incocompetence. From reading 
the Tartan, one would be led to 
believe that the life of the Car
negie student consists of Sem
inars on Alienation and Identi
ty, anti-Vietnam and draft dem
onstrations, and other activities 
evidencing his soeial-conoiousness and involvement, which 
|!'e also In Things. The activi
ties of the fraternity system, 
far example, which concern a 
great many more people, get 
scant, if any, mention. (In a 
fare instance of condescension, 
Mr Wanetik allowed some pic
tures of Greek Sing, but 
f couldnt spare any writers from 
I his revolutionary activities to 
Write any articles.) The reasons 
*r this is that Mr. Wanetik 
thiinkis that the student should 
ta Involved; such things as fra
ternities and sororities are Out
moded and Irrelevant. The pro
blem is not whether Mr. Wane
tik s beliefs are accurate, but 
whether he has the right to use 
a newspaper financed, staffed, 
and supported by all the stu
dents, at least indirectly, las a 
vehicle for a noisy fringe group. 
In so doing, he is violating the 
rights of the many on campus 
who are not Involved in the 
pseudo-intellectual sense and 
who realize that Student Gov
ernment, while obviously far 
from perfect, is vastly superior 
to the anarchy of multitudinous 
pressure groups noisily con
fronting the Administration, las 
SCORE envisions.
Yours truly, 
Robert P. Arias 
Junior, Mechanical Engineering
Editors Note:
Allow us to address ourselves 
to a few points, Mr. Arias.
Mr. Arias is laboring under 
the misconception that the fra
ternity system involves more 
students on this campus than 
do symposia, the war in Viet
nam, and the draft. Since set 
of all people who are draftable 
is functionally the universe of 
all college males, and since the 
fraternity system is a subset 
of all college males, it appears 
that, all things being equal, you 
lose, Mr. Arias.
Now, as for our coverage of 
the activities of the fraternity 
system. The photos were selfexplanatory, and did the job of 
describing what occurred rath
er well.
Considering the proportion of 
social - consciousness articles 
to descriptions of fraternity life, 
allow us to ask you a question. 
Who finished first, second, and 
third in the plank joust at 
Spring Carnival two years ago? 
How did that order of events 
affect your life in the long run?
We feel obliged to defend the 
members of SCORE aginst your 
rather scurrilous attack. I 
would believe that you are re
ferring to Mr. Payne (who is 
to be commissioned on 3 June, 
1968, as a 2nd Lieutenant, US. 
Army Corps of Engineers) as 
the Vietnik. As for our other 
members, you are hereby ad
vised that several of the sun
dry miscontnets are members 
of the present Student Govern
ment and Administration com
mittees.
Finally, let us address our
selves to In Things and Out 
Things. It is an In Thing, since 
the candidacy of George Wal
lace, to use the buzz word, 
pseudo-intellectual. It is also 
and an In Thing to be all white, 
up tight, true blood American, 
whatever the hell that is. What 
is being glossed over here is 
that in 1776 it was it was an 
In Thing to revolt, because peo
ple were waking up. In 1863 it 
was an In Thing to make Eman
cipation Proclamations because 
people were also waking up. 
People are waking up to the 
fact that, as in 1776, they should 
have control over their own en
vironment. They are waking up 
to that fact, that, as in 1863, 
they should be considered as 
equals in the sight of the gov
ernment.
What were are trying to do 
is bring that waking spirit to 
this campus. We are not pub
lishing a campus newspaper. We 
are publishing a newspaper on 
a campus.
If the fraternity system feels 
that it is being slighted, it can 
do what everybody else does 
it can assign a few people to 
work for and with the paper to 
turn in articles every week. 
How about YOU, Mr. Arias?
Platforms, Weak, 
Haan Most Acceptable
Editor, The Tartan:
Having read the few plat
forms submitted to the Tartan 
I strongly question the strength 
of any of these students as 
presidential candidates. Reading 
them, I felt as though I had 
returned to high school, and was 
listening to S.G. candidates 
promise change, without the 
slightest concept of what prior
ities should be placed upon their 
reforms, or how they plan to ins
titute them.
Of those submitted, Ron Haan 
seems to have the only margin
ally acceptable platform present
ed. Talking the Mime Troups 
suggestion, I think that the stu
dent body should take Ron at 
his wordand give him one 
semester to give results.
If he cannot make good his 
platform, we should take the 
Troups final alternativeabol
ish the present form of rep
resentative government.
George R. Madaras
SCORE Leaves 
Power Vacuum
Editorl the Tartan:
Judging from the chief advo
cates of SCORE and from its 
most virulent adversaries, CMU 
has on its hands a movement 
of the underdog classes, commutors, and other non-Greeks, 
against vested interest, the 
Greeks. What SCORE either 
fails to realize or fails to admit 
is that if it succeeds, the Greeks 
will be forced to assume an even 
more diproportionate share of 
power at our university.
Editor Wanetik is quick to 
point out that as a senior, he 
will not be here next year to 
watch SCORE at work. But we 
undergraduates and juniors can 
predict our future. There will be 
a power vacuum at CMU. The 
pioneers of SCORE will be 
blithely doing their math home
work through September and 
October when suddenly theyll 
be panting for a breath of social 
life. Where are the TGIFs and 
the weekends, those trivial 
Student Government projects 
we all take for granted? There 
will be only one remaining body 
on campus with the power and 
scope to organize a social func
tion, namely CFP. It will be 
tough because the fraternities 
are not rich, and they will be 
working on short notice, but 
theyll hire fifth rate entertain
ment and hold a weekend, open 
only to Greeks. From next year 
on, if you want to have any 
fun at CMU, you will be obliged 
to join a fraternity or a sorority. 
The rejected will stew in bitter
ness. Some underdog might 
say to me, You have just des
cribed Tech as it is now. This 
is untrue. I have described Jim 
Crow laws, when currently we 
have defacto segregation.
Now everyone knows that 
underdogs tend to resent so
ciety and delight in seeing it die. 
When I first heard of SCORE 
I thought, There go the sour 
grapes people trying to drag 
our third rate campus down to 
the fifth rate level. However, 
after talking to SCORE people 
and reading about their move
ment in the TARTAN, I am con
vinced that many of them are 
sincerely trying to raise the lev
el of social life in Tech, and that 
their voice is long overdue. To 
this healthy element in SCORE 
and to all civic minded students 
I appeal to forget SCORE and 
embrace the fofliowing proposal:
Let us call a constitutional 
convention and revamp Student 
Government. If this proposal is 
accepted as a referendum in the 
Student Government elections, 
delegates will be elected from all 
the Student Government Senate 
constituencies. Their job would 
not be to change the Student 
Government structure, because 
this is picayune, and a new 
structure historically often ends 
up worse than the last, but 
rather to throw out the present 
CMU social calendar and write 
up a new one from scratch. The 
students will decide how many 
and What kind of schoolwide 
weekends we want, or if we 
want weekends as such at all. 
They will see to it that the X 
on your schedule card is filled 
with speakers, lectures, and the 
like. They will come up with 
many other novel ideas, con
ceived in the image of the joint 
student body, Greek and nonGreek, Margaret Morrison, Fine 
Arts, and E & S  ideas not 
subject to the step by step ap
proval of our feudal lord, the 
administration. Who is to exe
cute this convention? I think 
Student Government would be 
proud to do so.

650 Does Not 
Represent Support
Editor, The Tartan,
Once again AFPF has firmly 
implanted their collective full 
face images in the ground. The 
student body was informed of 
this latest failure via a second
ary headline on last weeks 
Tartan stating that a rousing 
650 students signed the petition 
to ban military recruiting.
Even allowing an additional 
500 students in support (to ac
count for reluctance to sign for 
fear of reclassification) the total 
represents less than 30 per
cent of the total student body. 
Thus minority support is evi
denced despite a vigorous pro
gram of personal approach so
licitation. (I personally was ap
proached no fewer than five 
times in two days while eating 
ir. the snack bar!)
Surely the administration 
could not seriously consider any 
action based on a demand hav
ing such nebulous support! Ad
mit it AFPFyou simply cannot 
generate the amount of student 
support you need.

Gregory Withdraws 
From S.G. Raee
Editor, The Tartan:
Having considered what the 
duties and demands of the office 
of president of Student Govern
ment should be, I have conclud
ed that I will be unable to de
vote the time necessary to ac
complish what I believe should 
be done, should I be elected. I 
am therefore withdrawing as a 
candidate for the office of presi
dent. I offer my support and 
wishes for success to the 68-69 
Student Government.

Senate Candidates 
Present Platforms
Tom Brezny
There are many independents 
at CMU. They do not guide 
their actions according to a 
its the thing to do theory. 
They are not back slapping joyboys, nor do they join every 
organization in sight. Some 
dont even care about apathy, 
but are concerned about stay
ing up all night to prepare to
morrows assignments.
From the administration they 
desire good living conditions 
and a realistic view of the world. 
I am an Independent. This is 
the qualification I submit. In
dependents should not have to 
march in the street everytime 
they have a complaint. They 
deserve a representative who 
has the means to air their 
views and to have action taken. 
The elected Senate should be 
such a means, acting indepen
dently of any appointed com
mittee.
Ira Smith
I am presently a member of 
the Senate representing the 
Mens Dorms. As a candidate 
for re-election to this office, I 
promise to fufill my obligations 
to the students in representing 
themand not just myself.
In regard to SCORE, I urge 
every student to not support 
this organization  or shall I 
say disorganization. SCORE 
will accomplish less than Sen
ate is presently accomplishing, 
for SCORE has no true organ
ization and does not have the 
power to effect administration 
policy; Senate does have this 
power.
As a Senator, I believe that 
the names and addresses of all 
Senators should be posted in 
each constituency; in this man
ner, any student can contact 
any of the Senators representing 
him to have any proposal 
brought up at the next Senate 
meeting; these meetings should 
be held once a week with spe
cial sessions called when neces
sary.
I intend to do all I can to 
have the entire university placed 
on the pass-fail grading system; 
this system would be put an a 
trial basis starting next term; 
several universities and educa
tional institutes already have 
initiated such a program; our 
Drama Department presently 
has this grading system. I will 
appreciate any comments re
garding this proposal.
I promise to serve the best 
of my ability. I will be happy 
to bring up any proposal of any 
student or group of students 
at any Senate meeting; I may 
be contacted at B-214 Hamerschlag or by phone 682-9778. I 
will appreciate your vote in the 
election, April 4 and 5.

Alpha Epsilon . . . Worked as

dent activities budget for the

ed the plan for tighter control

activities ... Is a member of 
the staff of the Carnegie Tech

If elected, I would work for 
a stronger more unified stu
dent government which could 
truly represent the student 
body.

If you have been wandering 
around Skibo recently, you have 
probably seen strange platforms 
lying around the Ballroom, as well 
as racks of costumes in the High
lander Room. These are the sets 
and scenery for this year 's Scotch 
and Soda productions. Voltaire 
and the Witches an<i That Is the 
Question. The ideas formed in the 
minds of the designers are rapid
ly taking shape to be ready for 
opening night, April 26.
Wth the actors on stage there 
must be lighting, sets, and cos
tumes calculated to set the wide
ly different moods of the two 
shows. The costume designer for 
both shows is Arnold S. Levine, 
a sophomore Set Design major. 
This is his first design work on 
campus, although he has designed 
sets and costumes for several com
munity theater shows in his home 
town of Stamford, Conn., includ
ing South Pacific and Camelot. 
Arnie was on stage acting in last 
years S n S production, Pippin. 
Pippin.
Arnie is facing the challenge 
of designing costumes for two 
complete and contrasting shows. 
For Voltaire, his costumes must 
support a serious and highly dra
matic opera. Fqr That Is the Ques
tion, he must design for musical 
comedy, with an entirely differ
ent mood. Also, he must provide 
costumes for two complete casts

rather than just one. His problems 
are his budget and the number of 
people involvednot that either 
one alone is at all bad, just the 
combination of the two.
The set designers f or these 
shows have attacked their prob
lems differently. Bert Cottine, a 
junior in Set Design from Long 
Island, Was assistant designer for 
Nouveau, the Sn S production 
of two years ago. His set for Vol
taire and the Witches is stylized 
and structured, reaching the 
mood of the opera through the 
use of shape and form rather than 
detail.
The sets for That Is the Ques
tion, designed by Mark Pirolo. 
solve the problem of settin - the 
mood in a different fashion. Mark 
is a sophomore Set Design major 
from just South of Chicago, ac
tive as a designer in high school 
and summer theater groups. His 
sets establish the moods of the 
various scenes by selecting real 
elements of the environment to 
place on stage. Mark also has a 
few additional problems. As That 
Is the Question is a musical com
edy, with a great deal of move
ment and dancing, the sets and 
platforms must be heavy and firm. 
However, the movement of the 
sets on and off stage will be done 
by the actors, so the sets must be 
fairly easy to move. Mark is also 
working closely with Arnie to co
ordinate the costumes with the 
sets.
The lighting for both shows is 
being done by Don Earl, a senior 
in Technical Production from Old 
Greenwich. Conn. Don also de
signed the lighting for Pippin, 
Pippin last year. However, this 
year he must light two co upletely contrasting shows, where last 
year he had to worry about only 
one. For Voltaire, he must use 
careful and dramatic mood light
ing. For That Is the Question, he 
must light an active, moving mu
sical comedy.
Another problem involved with 
the show is the floor covering on 
the stage. The stage, to be set up 
in the Ballroom, is rather old and 
splintered, and it will be neces
sary to cover it with something 
tough, but textured enough to per
mit dancing and quick movement. 
The crew has been working like 
hell to get the sets built and ready, 
and painting starts this week (any
one who would like to help will 
be welcome). The sets and cos
tumes are quickly taking shape, 
and will soon be ready to support 
the actors and provide those who 
see Scotch and Sods this year with 
masterful and impressive enter
tainment.

NEW YORK  A new survey of 
American college student opinion 
on major issues shows them to be 
far less in rebellion and much 
closer to adult views than is com
monly believed. The poll was con
ducted by Newsweek magazine 
and represents cross-section of 8.- 
700 students from 150 colleges.
Among its highlights :
On Vietnam only 17 per cent 
advocate a unilateral halt in bomb
ing and withdrawal of US forces, 
while 34 per cent would escalate 
the war effort to seek a military 
victory.
On the one person they respect 
most, a parent or relative is cited 
by 19 per cent. Far down the line 
are celebrity choices such as the 
late John F. Kennedy with 3.4 per 
cent. Two per cent of the students 
cited myself, more than was ac
corded any other individual other 
than President Kennedy.
On politics, no Presidential 
hopeful received a significant 
plurality. Highest is New York 
Senator Robert F. Kennedy with 
15 per cent backing for the Presi
dency. President Johnson and Nix
on each received 11 per cent; Nel
son Rockefeller, ten; George Romney, nine; and Ronald Reagan, 
eight.
Thd Newsweek poll was con
ducted by reply - card question
naire last fall as a part of the 
magazines College News Letter. 
The 8,700 respondents voted by 
Jan. 1.
In addition to the 34 per cent 
who would escalate in Vietnam 
and the 17 per cent who would 
withdraw unconditionally, another 
eight per cent would call a cease 
fire and seek negotiation. (But six 
of this eight per cent would then 
escalate if the call for negotia
tions were refused.) Six per cent 
would continue present policy, 
five would appeal to the United 
Nations or other outside groups, 
five would recognize the Viet 
Cong, and two would simply ne
gotiate now. The remaining 17 
per cent had no opinion or sug
gested individual plans too di
verse to tally.
On the draft, the Newsweek sur
vey showed that 44 per cent of 
the students disapprove of some
one who rejects his military obli
gation, while 37 per cent accept 
his position if he is sincere. 
Sixteen per cent refused to pass 
judgment, saying it is a personal 
decision, and the remaining three 
per cent passed over the question.
Only five per cent of the respon
dents say they favor a lottery ap
proach to the draft, while a surprisihg 17 per cent support Uni
versal Military Training. Thirtyseven per cent prefer a volunteer 
army and 32 per cent favor the 
present draft setup as is. Seven 
per cent offered their various in
dividual alternatives, and two per 
cent skipped the question.
The poll of Presidential choices 
drew votes for 11 different candi
dates besides the six leaders cited 
above, John Lindsay, Barry GoldFriday Cine Series on March
29 is LAvventura, and Italian film

water and Charles Percy each re
ceived three per cent. William 
Fulbright got two per cent and 
George Wallace one per cent.
Votes for the person in the 
world you most respect were 
widely scattered after the 19 per 
cent choice of a parent or rela
tive. John F. Kennedy was second 
with 3.4 per cent. Pope Paul with 
1.7 per cent, Martin Luther King 
and Barry Goldwater, each with
1.4 per cent, and a teacher with
1.5 per cent. Myself received 
two per cent of the total.
In selecting todays Big Man 
on the Campus, 39 per cent told 
Newsweek they preferred the 
good student or intellectual, 
while 17 per cent selected the 
involved, aware student. No 
other grouping drew more than 
nine per cent and athletes didnt 
even figure in the returns.
Most students  some 73 per 
cent, according to the Newsweek 
surevey  are content with their 
choice of college, and say they 
would attend the same school giv
en the chance to begin again. Six
ty-three per cent say they want to 
get an advanced degree.
Twenty-eight per cent of the 
students say they have taken part 
in a demonstration or march, 27 
per cent have sent a protest letter, 
and 66 per cent say they have 
signed a petition.
The issue of Vietnam, they say,
according to the Newsweek 
survey  are content with their 
choice of college, and say they 
would attend the same school giv
en the chance to begin again. Six
ty-three per cent say they want to 
get an advanced degree.
Twenty-eight per cent of the 
students say they have taken part 
in a demonstration or march. 27 
per cent have sent a protest letter, 
and 66 per cent say they have 
signed a petition.
The issue of Vietnam, they say. 
has figured very little in these ex
pressions, accounting for a little 
more than a quarter of demonstra
tion activity and 16 per cent of 
letter-writing or petitioning. The 
bulk of all protest activity has 
been on other world problems or 
campus issues.

frustrated artistic idealism of his 
inner life and the cold inhuman 
natoure of modern reality, whicl) 
in his eyes is characterized en
tirely by technology. His inabil
ity to be a part of the world and 
to overcome his social and sexual 
taboos, including his prejudice 
against technology, lead him to 
think of himself as a Steppen
wolf, or in other words a loner.

selves a man has. The lecture is
