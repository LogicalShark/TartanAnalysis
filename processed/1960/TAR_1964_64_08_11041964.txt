Second Talk 
Tomorrow
by Joe Califf
Theodore O. Yntema, Vice Pres
et ident of the Ford Motor Company, 
spoke on Why Capitalism last 
Thursday at this years first Benjamn Fairless lecture.
Mr, Yntema stated that The 
great virtue of capitalism is that 
it harnesses to the common good 
the powerful sources of human 
selfishness.
Mentioning that Capitalism is 
^ usually ciiticized on the grounds 
of its unfair results, he said that 
self-intersted capitalists . . con
tribute mainly to the enrichment 
of other people . . . (since) in
creases in output resulting from 
more capital and better manage
ment are not kept by the owners 
of capital, but are widely distri
buted in the form of higher wages, 
e lower prices, or better products.
This lecture was the first of a 
series of three on the Enrichment 
of Man. The remaining two will 
be at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow and 
November 12 in the Skibo ball
room.
Sells Fake 
* Mag Scripts
by Candy Etkin and Liz Seley
False magazine subscriptions 
were sold to Morewood Gardens 
residents last Thursday by a girl 
posing as a Japanese Exchange 
Student at George Washington 
University.
Tina, as she called herself, told 
f customers that she had been in 
this country for one year. For 
continuation of her scholarship 
she had to compete with other 
foreign students selling magazine 
subscriptions.
She spent nine hours on campus 
and did most of her soliciting in 
E tower.
Thursday evening, the girls got 
suspicious and called the Better 
S' Business Bureau. Tinas company, 
' Publishers Continental Sales 
Corporation is legitimate, but 
Tina is not a registered sales rep
resentative.
Although cash sales could not 
be recovered, the girls were ad
vised to stop payment on their 
checks.

Comp Programming Game 
Simulates Infantry Conflict
by Howard Weiss
Computerized Infantry Tactics, CIT, is a new game 
invented by Mr. David L. Pamas for use in the Electrical 
Engineering Department. It is a fast moving military game
-----------------------------------------------------?played by two people or teams.
Well, to be more accurate, the 
moves are actually determined 
by two computers, which are pro
gramed by the students taking 
course E410.
Whichever team first captures 
the opponents computer center 
wins the war. The computer cen
ter is protected by three formid
able traps. The battlefield, itself, 
is seven squares wide and eight 
squares deep. At various squares 
on the board ominous tanks, 
riflemen, bazookas, and even en
gineers are constantly attacking 
the other teams army and de
fending their computer center.
As one might suspect, the en
gineers have a dominant role in 
the game. There are four of 
them on each side, and they are 
the only pieces permitted to de
stroy a trap, thereby permitting 
their fellow dogfaces to destroy 
the computer.

(Greek Week Had Its Origins
2-
At Ohio University In 1930
Greek Week, November 9-14, will be highlighted by 
many meetings and parties.
What is Greek Week? It is a period of time set aside to 
re-examine fraternity ideals, to*-----------------------------------------------------
^appraise progress toward realizing 
these ideals, and to acquaint the 
campus and community with the 
ideals for which fraternities and 
sororities stand. It is also the time 
to seek solutions to problems 
among the groups themseves, be
tween the fraternities and the col
lege, and with the community at 
large.
Why is Greek Week? Greek 
Week began as an experiment in 
interfraternity understanding and 
has grown to include education 
of the campus and the community 
to the values and purposes of fra
ternities, sororities, social activi
ties, and scholarship.
The Greek Week tradition now 
observed had its beginning at Ohio 
University in 1930. At this time 
there was found a need for the de*j, velopment of a program to bring 
together all Greeks for discussion 
and analysis of their common pro
blems and values.
The formal organization of 
Greek W^.ek began in 1939, but 
sororities were not included in the 
plans until 1941. Most fraternity 
activities were brought to a tem
porary halt during World War II. 
In 1949, Greek Week was revived 
on the national scale.
the fraternity and sorority mem
bers. One method used to achieve 
cooperation and understanding is 
the discussion of fraternal ideals 
and their practical application.
Some of the problems discussed 
are scholarship, rush, pledge 
training, house management, and 
finances. CFP and Panhel pro
blems are also considered for the 
well-being of the fraternity sys
tem as well as the individual 
chapter.
Social activities are also includ
ed as an important part of Greek 
Week. A dance and house parties 
are held as part of the weeks pro
gram. The Masquerade Ball, No
vember 13 is open not only to 
Greek members, but to all stu
dents in order to bring the campus 
together.
The nature and content of 
Greek Week .has taken many 
forms, depending upon the needs 
and resources of the particular 
campus. There is, therefore, no 
one program for Greek Week that 
can be set down as a common one. 
A common denominator for all 
programs is the drive for coop
eration and understanding among

Ordinarily the bill is covered by advertising, circula

felt that the bill should be paid by Mr. Pollock.
Questions raised by one of our reporters, the layout 
editor, a proofreader, and several other members of the 
staff, give strong indication that it was Mr. Pollock who, 
without authorization, instructed the printer to make the 
particular changes in the MDC story. (The Tartan in fact is 
in possession of the page proof on which appears his hand
writing specifying these changes.)
Mr. Pollock directed the printer to re-arrange the front

Because Mr. Pollock this year is in no way affiliated 
with the campus newspaper, he simply has NO right to 
decide how WE shall run it. The Tartan staff cannot, and 
does not intend to, direct him in the operations of HIS 
organization. But, he has already suggested that he holds a 
self-claimed authority over us in the operations of OUR 
organization.
We wonder, frankly, whether a student of this inclina

elected, but the other two offices to which he becomes entitled

As for sororities not promoting

with low grades to attend a study

Facilities Hamper IM Football
The intramural touch football season, just concluded, has 
been one of the most successful in the history of the school in 
terms of student participation and campus interest. The 
playing conditions, however, were far from adequate this 
year, and it is remarkable that no serious injuries occurred 
as a result.
Only two fields of play were available, a fact which re
quired that the schedule be extended an additional two 
weeks. As a result, many of the important games at the end 
of the regular season, and most of the playoffs ended with 
limited visibility for the players, or else in total darkness.
The limited space available for the program required 
that one field be constructed parallel to the Margaret Morri;son parking lot with an out-of-bounds line within fifteen 
feet of the chain link fence. The number of players who 
crashed into that fence after a desperation attempt to catch ^ 
a pass would be too numerous to count, but fortunately, 
again, the serious injury did not occur.
In addition, the restricted space available for the varsity 
football practices necessitated that, at times, their football 
sleds were pushed onto the IM fields. Had an unsuspecting 
intramural player crashed into one of these sleds, while 
watching a pass, the results could have been very serious.
The two fields, themselves, were given better care and 
maintenance this year, and the total number of injuries sus
tained within the confines of the fields showed a marked ( 
decrease. This in itself should serve as a reminder to the ad
ministration as to what can be accomplished with better 
facilities.
Needless to say, a situation exists which cannot be ignor
ed any longer. The expansion of a very successful intramural 
program is presently being hampered by inadequate facili
ties. The solution to the problem contains two parts. First, a 
third intramural field must be made available to the program, 
and next, lighting provisions must be made for the area. This 
would relieve the burden on the two present fields, and per
mit all of the games to be played under adequate lighting 
conditions. In addition, intramural soccer, which is presently 
being played under very poor conditions, and intramural soft
ball would also be greatly benefited, thus contributing to the 
program as a whole.
Since the point has been reached where serious injury 
is being risked by students who participate in the program, it 
is time for the administration to take positive action. A school 
such as Carnegie Tech, which places high value on the in
tellectual attainments of its students, cannot afford to neglect
i their physical welfare. .. ^ I'OtAl Green

high percentage of members of 
honoraries are Greeks. In all 
facets of campus life, Greeks 
are active. We feel that sorori
ties are not ineffectual as Miss 
Simberloff states.
As for sorority floors them- j 
selves, we fell that a few mis- j 
conceptions should be cleared up. |
First, sororities would not take up 
an entire tower. By mutual agree
ment of the housing authorities 
and sorority members, floors 
would be located throughout the 
dormitory, thus not really placing 
sororities at any advantage when 
room selection takes place. Sorori
ties will follow the same rules as 
any other dorm residents. No 
special privileges will be granted 
them.
Further, the floor counselors 
for the Greeks will be unpaid 
sorority members, thus freeing 
seven counselors for use in other 
parts of the dorm. Since the floors 
chosen will be small, not all so
rority members will be able to live

Pa*e 6  CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN  Wednesday, November 4, 1964
Only a first down run by BSR 
quarterback Steve Kessler kept 
Beta Sig from being shut out dur
ing the first half. After a safety 
against BSR in the early mo
ments of the third quarter, Stan
ley Perper came in at QB for 
PKA, and promptly hit Dennis 
Cash for the TD. Before the af
ternoon was over, Perper hit 
Chuck Bounds and Sabella with 
scoring tosses, as Beta Sig never 
really mounted an offense all af
ternoon.
Beta Sig, who had beaten ATO 
in the quarterfinals, 16 to 10, 
fought a hard battle against BTP 
in the semi-finals before drop
ping a 23 to 15 decision. GSIA 
gained the semi-finals with a 38 
to 10 whipping of SAE, but had 
their hands full in the semi-finals

by A1 Green
When the smoke finally cleared from the intramural 
football battleground, GSIA Black stood alone atop the 
school as IM champions. ?
During the first half of the 
championship game Beta Theta 
Pi matched the grads, but quar
terback John Williamson turned 
loose an aerial display of fire
works in the second half, with 
Ed Prescott and Hal Klingspom 
on the receiving end, and the 
grads pulled away to win 39 to 
23.
against PKA, before claiming a 
33 to 28 win. PKA, meanwhile, 
had gained the semi-finals by up
setting the powerful Grad Nads, 
18 to 14.
by A1 Green
Alpha Tau Omega, Beta Theta 
Pi, and GSIA dominate the 1964- 
65 edition of tne Intramural AllSchool football team. ATO cap
tured four of the twelve positions 
on the mithical array, while the 
Betas took three, and GSIA two.
The first team offense is headed 
by Beta quarterback Lee Collins. 
Possessed with the ability to throw 
an accurate pass, even when off 
balance, Collins directed the 
Betas to a second-place finish in 
the school standings.
Don Shockey, MVP
At one end, and winner of the 
MVP award this year, is Don 
Shockey of the Grad Nads. Time 
and time again Shockey made 
spectacular catches over the heads 
of defenders to break games wide 
open for the Nads.
At the other terminal position 
is Bob Livengood of Beta Theta 
Pi. The pass combination of Col
lins to Livengood produced more 
six-point touchdowns this year 
than any other combination in the 
school. At center is Ed Prescott, 
team captain for the GSIA
Black. A rugged blocker, Pres
cott also had the distinction of be
ing the highest-scoring center in 
the school.
At one offensive halfback, posi
tion is Alpha Tau Omegas Tom 
Kline. One of the best blockers in 
the school, Kline was also an of
fensive threat on pass patterns. 
The other halfback position went 
to GSIAs Hal Klingsbom. One of 
the fastest halfbacks in the pro
gram, Klingsporn teamed with 
Prescott to give GSIA two excel
lent pass receivers.
Defensive Unit
Two members of the offensive 
squad were also elected to firstteam berths on the defensive unit. 
Shockey was awarded a defensive 
backfield position, while Kline was 
named at a lineman. Teaming 
with Kline on the defensive line 
is Beta Theta Pis Sam Cupps. A 
hard-charging rusher, Cupps al
lowed opposing quarterbacks little 
time in which to get off a pass.
Heading the defensive second
ary is Gerry Unger, ATO team 
captain and linebacker. Adept at 
diagnosing passpatterns, Gerry is 
also a very capable rusher. At the 
other linebacking post is Sigma 
Alpha Epsilons outstanding pass 
defender. Bill McClure. The de
fensive unit is rounded out by 
Shockeys running mate at safety, 
ATOs Frank Oliver. Numerous 
interceptions by Frank during the
regular season helped ATO in 
gaining the playoffs.
The second team offensive unit 
is headed by quarterback Steve 
Kessler of BSR. His teammate, 
John Oppenheimer, is at one end, 
while the other terminal position 
goes to SAEs Don Pitman. At 
center is Constantine Kalogeras, 
of the Finks B, while the two 
halfback posts are held by Tom 
Chamberlin of Sigma Nu, and Ron 
DeFeo of Beta Theta Pi.
The defensive line is composed 
of TDPs Roger Blau, and Bob 
Popper of the Cellar Dwellers. 
Frank Brady of Sigma Nu is at 
one linebacking post, while his 
running mate is BTPs Dale John
son. SAEs Doug Cranwell, and 
GSIAs Joe Lees round out the 
squad at the safety positions.

A leaping catch of a Lee Col
lins pass in the end zone by Bob 
Livengood put the Betas in front 
in the second quarter, 8 to 2. 
Williamson came right back, how
ever, with a 40 yard pass play to 
Prescott to tie the score. William
son ran for two touchdowns dur
ing the third quarter to open a 
21-10 GSIA lead, but the Betas 
werent through yet.
On the first play of the final 
quarter, Livengood made a spec
tacular catch of a Collins pass 
in the end zone to reduce the 
margin to five points, but then 
the roof fell in. Prescott pulled 
in a deflected pass and went all 
the way to score, and after an 
interception by Howie Pifer, Wil
liamson went to work and hit 
Prescott for another six-pointer.
Livengood then made his third 
leaping catch of a Collins TD 
pass to narrow the margin to 
34-22. On a punting situation for 
GSIA, the ball eluded the Beta 
secondary, and Prescott covered 
it in the end zone for the final 
score of the day.
PKA Takes Consolation Game
The consolation encounter was 
much more decisive. PKA took 
an 8 to 1 lead over BSR in the 
first half, and then turned on 
the steam to win going away, 31 
to 3, Ken Adler hit Vic Sabella 
with a long TD pass in the first 
quarter for PKAs first score.

Denison tackle.
by Ron Bidula
The football fortunes of Carnegie Tech sunk even lower 
last Saturday at Tech Field as the Tartans went down to 
their sixth defeat of the season. The Big Red from Denison
University exhibited a polished, -----------------------------
powerful single wing attack that 
soundly thrashed Tech 27-7.
Tech played the Ohioans even 
for the first two quarters before 
Techs lack of depth took its toll.
Denison scored three times in the 
last half against a tired CIT deIM'
fense to clinch the victory.
The Tartans kicked off to open 
the game. After a trade of punts 
gave the visitors the ball again on 
their own 2, Denison appeared to 
be on the move. The Tech de
fense stiffened, though, and the 
visitors kicked to the CIT 25 
after five plays.
Tech Conies Alive
After an incomplete screen pass, 
Techs offense quickly jelled. On 
the next play junior fullback Dick 
Merrill tore through right tackle 
and outran the Denison secondary 
for 57 yards to the 18. Merrill 
then carried again for 4 yards before Coach Gasparella decided to 
go to the air Wisniewski spotted 
Dave DAppolonia free in the cor
ner on the next play, and the 
senior end was all set to gather in 
the aerial when he was knocked 
down by a desperate Big Red de
fender.
The interference penalty gave 
CIT a first down on the Deni
son 2. Merill plunged over for 
the score. Wizs conversion was 
^ good and the Tartans led 7-0 
with 42:5 left in the first period. 
After Denison was offside on 
the ensuing kickoff, Jack Love 
boomed the ball to the goal line, 
and Denison was stuck with poor 
field position when Eric Ivary 
could return only to the 21. But 
then the Denison ground attack 
went to work. San White and 
> Denny Price tore the Tartan line 
 shreds as the Big Red moved 
 W their 46, with five rushes, White 
then circled right end to the Tech 
29. Price and White moved the 
ball to the CIT 19 before the 
quarter ended.
Then the Denison offensive 
stalled. After a reverse and two 
rushes netted only six yards, an 
Ivary to Jim Moats pass was 
incomplete and the Tartans took 
over on downs at 12:50. Tech 
r couldnt move out of the hole, I 
however, and Pete Qstling kicked 
to the 50.
Denison then unveiled its own 
air attack, or at least the Big 
Red tried to. Mangarella, DAppo- j 
loni and Patula nailed Price for j 
two big losses as he went back 
to pass which forced a fourth and j 
thirty-two situation on the vis- i 
itors. Tech returned the punt to j 
the Denison 45, but CITs offense 1
again couldnt move the ball. 
Ostling kicked to the Denison 12.
. Denison Ties Score
The visitors then moved 88 
yards in only four plays. Price 
and White again moved at will 
through the Tech defense. The 
big play was a 33 yard White to 
Ned Martin pass to the CIT 12. 
Price circled left end for the score 
on the next play. The PAT was 
good and the score was now tied 
7-7 at 5:13. Neither team could 
score again in the first half. Den
isons air attack was hapless, but 
the Tartans offense was just as 
futile.
The second half began as de
fensive battle. After an exchange 
of punts put Tech deep in their 
own territory, Tech was forced to 
kick again, giving the Big Red 
the ball at the CIT 44. White 
tren pased to Lee Bulger at the 
CIT 15. Then White ripped 
through the middle of the Tech 
line and across the goal for the 
score. The PAT was good and 
Denison now led 14-7 at 8:40.
Defense then prevailed once 
again. After the Tartans punted 
to the Big Red 45, Pi ice and 
White once again grounded out 
the yardage to the CIT 21 before 
the drive stalled as the quarter 
ended. A Denison field goal at
tempt was wide to the left as the 
third period opened.
Tartans Fall Behind
Tech air attack quickly moved 
the ball to their 49, but a fourth 
and oni Wisniewski to Black 
aerial was batted down by Lee 
Bolger. The two teams then trad
er punts for the third time of the

afternoon. Denison then moved 
56 yards in seven plays for their 
third score.
Price took the snap from cen
ter at the 26 and sped over right 
guard for his second TD of the 
day. Freshman Chuck Herron 
blocked the conversion attempt 
and the Tartans now trailed 20-7 
at 6:14 of the fourth quarter.

Tartan 23. Two plays later, 
Ivary hit Ted Stalzer for the 
score. The conversion was good 
and the score at 2:31 was 27-7.
The Tartans still wanted to 
score. After four short passes 
moved the ball to the Tech 47, 
Wisniewski hit Dick Bell at the 
20 and the freshman halfback 
showed the fans some beautiful 
broken field running as he crossed 
the goal with only fifteen seconds 
left in the game. Tech was off
side on the play, however, and the 
officials brought the ball back to 
the Tech 42. The game ended two 
plays later as Sherme Hotchkiss 
interceptd a desperation Wisniew
ski pass.
The Tartans will try again next 
Saturday at Tech Field against 
the University of Rochester.

Cross Country Team Unbeaten;
Extends Win Streak to 33
Tartan Photo by Fred Maize
Runners from Carnegie Tech and Westminster line up for the start of their cross country meet 
last Saturday,
by Chris Macosko
Few Carnegie Tech students know anything about the 
sport of cross country and fewer still have seen a meet, but 
their team has run up a string of 33 straight victories and
broken records in nearly every ?----------------------;-----------------------
race.
Perhaps the strongest small col
lege team in the Tri-state area, 
the harriers illustrate that Tech 
can and does have outstanding 
athletic teams .
The Tartan hill runners easily 
added two more names to the list 
of defeated teams as they out
classed Waynesburg last Wednes
day 18-44 and Westminster 20-37 
Saturday. Both were run through 
the hilly paths of Schenley Park.
Waynesburgs highly touted 
freshman record holder Keith 
Meekins had Techs triumvirate 
Harry Binkholder, Roger Cairns, 
and Chris Macosko a little nerv
ous before the meet. The three 
took off to build an early lead but 
the Waynesburg flash proved to 
be only that and the three won 
easily, turning in their seasons 
best performances. Burkholder 
and Cains crosed the finish in 23 
minutes only 16 seconds off the 
course record.
Macosko was close in 23:43. 
Senior George Crawford and im
proving sophomore Ken Phillips 
followed Mackins taking fifth and 
sixth. Thom Kelm, Paul Fackler, 
and Rich Schall made the meet a 
runaway as they took eighth 
thru tenth respectively,
Westminster Also Falls
Just as many swimmers do bet
ter in cold water, most distance
runners enjoy cold, even drizzling 
weather; perhaps it makes them 
want to get finished quicker. 
Against Westminster, the sun was 
there and the competition wasnt 
and Burkholder, Cairns and Ma
cosko finished relaxed tied for 
first in 235:1. However Westmins
ter provided a hard race for the 
rest of the Tartan harriers. De
spite his best performance of 
25:02, Phillips couldnt catch Eric 
Burns and Ed Craxton, Kein 
turned in a 25:40, his best, but 
settled for eighth place.
A hard puffing freshman, Bill 
Marietta, made his bid for late 
season stardom, as he pushed 
Crawford with a 26:15. They took 
tenth and eleventh. Fackler, 
Schall, Dave Simons, Russ Jones, 
and Bil Klinchock completed the 
scoring for Tech,
Tartans Face St. Vincent Today
The Tartans finished their reg
ular season with a meet at St. 
Vincent this afternoon and face 
Rochester Tech at home 11:30 Sat
urday morning. Rochester is an 
unknown quantity but is report
ed to have a pair of speedsters. 
This will be Burkholder, Cairns, 
and Macoskos last chance this 
season at the Carnegie school rec
ord set by Mike Campbell in 1962. 
The three, with Phillips and 
Keim, have been working on in
tervals of the 4.3 mile course to 
bring their times on each section 
down toward the record.

Do you like to shoot? Would 
you like to learn? Heres your 
chance. A general meeting will 
be held this Friday on the Jen
kins Rifle Range in MMCC for 
the purpose of reorganizing the 
Carnegie Tech Rifle Club.
Because of the large interest 
shown in shooting this fall dur
ing rifle tryouts, coaches Murphy 
and Speller of the Rifle Club along 
with Captain Steinbach of the 
ROTC department will sponsor a 
rifle club for anyone wishing to 
shoot small bore rifle and pistol. 
Over forty freshmen tried out 
for the teams and two shot well 
enough to have a hand the Tar
tans 1383-1375 lacing of Geneva.
Anyone in the rifle club who 
proves himself will be moved up 
to the varsity teams, but the club 
is open to anyone, regardless of 
ability or sex. This club is not 
an ROTC function, but open to 
anyone on campus. The range 
will tentatively be open to club 
members at least every Wednes
day from three to five-thirty.
Parking Ticket
Thats Honda. Just the ticket 
for parking on crowded cam
pus lots and, in fact, any
where at all. Ride your Honda 
right up to class, if you like. 
If the teacher gives you a 
funny look, its probably be

too.
See all the Honda models at
Civic Center 
Hondo Inc.
4519 Centre Ave. MU. 1-9935
The purpose of the meeting 
this Friday will be to recruit 
members, elect officers, and re/iew existing constitution and by 
laws. The amount of range time 
devoted to pistol and rifle shoot-v ' 
ing will be discussed along with 
plans for tournament entries and 
a spring picnic.
So if youre interested in rifle 
and pistol shooting, remember the 
organizational meeting this Fri
day at 4:30 011 the Jenkins Range 
in the basement of Margaret Mor
