A new electrical power system is being installed at 
Carnegie Tech which will eliminate the possibility of an
other blackout like the one of last April 17.
The entire campus, with the^ 
exception of More wood Gardens 
and the fraternity complex, had 
been without electrical power for 
a weekend.
The new system, to be com
pleted at the end of November, 
will cost a quarter of a million 
dollars. It will consist of two 
^ main circuits running to all the 
buildings on campus; there will 
be a regular A. C. circuit and 
one fail-safe circuit for emergen
cies.
The main power distribution 
center in Machinery Hall will 
handle an input of 4,160 volts.
Each circuit will carry 400 amps, 
almost hree times the capacity of 
the old circuits.
A new switching manhole, full 
of high-power lines, has been dug 
behind the Fine Arts building.
The electrical company has ad
vised all students against explor
ing and tampering therein.
Since last years cave-in of the 
concrete electrical power circuit,
Tech has been operating on a 
temporary power supply. This 
has been housed in a makeshift 
wooden conduit beside Engineer
ing Hall.

The Fine Arts Department lacks sufficient funds to cover 
their original plans for the proposed Dramatic Arts Center, 
it was stated last Friday by Norman Rice, dean of the
---------------------------------- ?College of Fine Arts.
At present he administration is 
working to bring the building to 
a cost the university can support.
According to Rice there is an 
ambitious scheme underway to 
meet these needs. However, no 
time table has been set.
Dean Rice added, we dont 
suffer from lack of leadership in 
the department. He indicated 
that although each new depart
ment head comes with new ideas, 
it doesnt change the plans eaei 
time. (This was in reference w 
last weeks statement that tne 
plans were stifled because of a 
need for a permanent administra
tor.)
The former head of the Drama 
Department, Dr. Robert Corrigan, 
is now a professor at New York 
University and drama critic for 
Nation magazine, not editor, as 
was earlier reported.
The Fine Arts program at Car
negie Tech has been recognized 
by officials as outstanding, but 
crowded.

The 72-piece Kiltie Marching Band made its debut Sat
urday during half-time at the Tech-Wooster football game.
The first theme was the New York Worlds Fair. The 
band presented marching forma-^ 
tions showing the New York ele
vator and Swiss skyride.
The half-time pageant was ar
ranged by Edward Maddon, who 
was affiliated with Boston College 
and had formerly arranged for 
such jazz artists -as Stan Kenton 
and Buddy Morrow.
Dr. Richard E. Strange, band 
director, prepares the format and 
formations for halftime shows. 
Student Congress allocations, 
which finance the arrangements, 
are sufficient his year to provide 
a different show for each home 
game.
The October 3 game with Case 
Tech will be an invitational band 
day, in which the Kilties will be 
joined by bands from Case Tech, 
North Hills, and WilKinsburg
High Schools for a specialty of 
massed brass sections.
At he Homecoming Game with 
Grove City, he halftime show will 
honor the Freshman Homecoming 
Queen.
The Kilties will travel to Lan
caster, October 24, on an invita
tion by Franklin & Marshall to 
play for their Homecoming week
end.
The following week, a pageant 
based on the forthcoming elec
tions will be presented for the 
Tech-Denison contest.
At the last game, in which we 
play the University of Rochester, 
the pageant will honor the state 
of Pennsylvania, the city of Pitts
burgh and Carnegie Tech.
The need for space is the pri
mary objective in building a new 
Dramatic Arts Center. There is 
inadequate storage space. This 
forces the Department of Drama 
to destroy sets after they have 
been used, for there is no place to 
keep them.
The shop space is limited and 
the sets must be constructed on 
stage, creating another problem 
There is also a great need for a 
separate theater for music, due to 
the fact that while the sets are 
under construction, the stage can 
not be used for other perform
ances.
All these deficiencies are hoped 
to be rectified upon the future 
completion of the Dramatic Arts 
Center.

Editorials
Revised Calendar
However much the quality of a Tech education is 
stressed, Carnegie must also fulfill American expectations of 
quantity in its teaching programs.
With these demands of quantity on all educational in
stitutions, schools must overcome the scheduling problems 
quantity carries with it. Carnegie administrators must or
ganize daily and weekly class schedules as well as plan a 
satisfactory yearly calendar to suit college standards.
On both scheduling levels, Tech has satisfied the require
ments, but the Carnegie Calendar does not represent the best 
possible effort for the years planning.
The calendar had remained essentially unchanged in 
major areas for too long. While Pitt and many other col
leges and universities have gone to trimester plans, others 
have gone to a quarters system, and Pennsylvania and others 
have just shuffled their two semesters around somewhat, 
Tech has done nothing.
It is not necessary for Tech to adopt the radical tri
mester or quarters systemindeed it would be a mistake 
to do so now. Many of the institutions on these new systems 
are dissatisfied with the results and are trying to succeed in 
an area already strewn with discontent and foolishness.
Pennsylvania is not dissatisfied with these shuffled two 
semester programs they initiated a few years ago in their 
Penn B Calendar. Briefly, their system is characterized 
by:
1. Almost complete pre-registration with final details 
arranged on the Tuesdays after Labor Day.
2. The first term begins on the Wednesday after Labor 
Day.
3. Class time is slightly lengthened.
4. The term is fourteen weeks long and ends on about 
December 23.
5. There are no extensive finals and the Christmas 
vacation is the semester break and is therefore slight
ly longer.
6. After the break, the second term begins and continues 
for sixteen weeks, until early May.
To establish their calendar, Pennsylvania violated the 
requirements of the engineering council (the E.P.C.D.)  
with a fourteen week first term. Accredited engineering 
schools must have fifteen week terms. They put a heavy 
strain on registration in one day as well as cramming an 
entire term between Labor Day and Christmas with no 
major breaks. They eliminated finals, which many courses 
relied on, and they moved classes further into the early 
September days.
In all of these areas Pennsylvania was causing hard 
feelings by changing and Tech would face these same argu
ments if a plan similar to the Penn B Calendar were 
adopted. But Penns positive arguments outweighed their 
reservations as do similar reasons for Techs considering a 
change.
1. The fifteen week requirement of the EPCD was 
bridged by Penns arguments that their second term com
pensated for the deficiency. This, with slightly longer class 
hours and their belief that very few classes really would 
suffer in quality or quantity of education, negated the 
councils threat to them.
2. Penn freed Christmas vacations of the apprehension 
of coming finals in courses they were disconnected from at 
home. It made the recess a freer period and more of a vaca
tion, while allowing administration much more time to plan 
and prepare for a new term.
3. Classes did not drag into warm weather when other 
college students were already out and on the labor market 
for summer jobs. Even the earlier start did not hurt them 
for Labor Day always had been a natural stopping point for 
summer work and vacations.
4. Penn eliminated finals which had been as much en
durance trials as those ending each Tech term.
Tech can adopt these same arguments and although 
they are by no means open and shut, they provide a starting 
point for students, faculty, and administration consideration. 
The changes might allow time for two hour finals and vaca
tions might be altered for an acceptable plan. Freshmen 
Orientation might be set the week before Labor Day with 
little hardship, otherwise the better opportunities for 
summer jobs, the freer Christmas vacation, and the compact
ness of the plans would be easily applied to the Tech needs..
A few years ago, the faculty Calendar Committee under 
Dean Brown, made an extensive survey of the Calendar 
and decided the current plan was as good as any. Their 
survey might have missed the Penn B proposal and it did 
miss the student opinions on the subject completely. Now, 
the General Campus Committee of the Student Congress is 
beginning a study of the Calendar proposals. They have am
munition on both sides and with a thorough study, starting 
at the Student Congress meeting, they can decide on a work
able and acceptable solution to Techs calendar.
The Calendar for 1965-66 is already passed, but it is not 
too soon to look at 1966-67, the junior year for the new 
freshmen.

LBJ Charged With Hypocrisy 
In His Political Stands
Editor, The Tartan:
Can any thinking citizen sup
port Lyndon Baines Johnson, a 
candidate of contradictions? John
son ran on two very different plat
forms in 1960The National Dem
ocratic Platform and the State 
Democratic Platform of Texas.
His National Democratic Plat
form called for further centraliza
tion of the Federal Government; 
at the same time he ran for the 
Texas Senate on a state platform 
that denounced the growing and 
menacing concentration of power 
in the central government.
His national program boosted 
medical care for the aged while 
has state program condemned 
medicare as a socialistic propo
sal.
Johnson promised school deseg
regation in the 1960 national cam
paign while at the same time he 
promised to protect the wishes of 
the people of local school districts 
in the operation of their schools.
While Johnson was a member 
of the House and Senate between 
1942 and 1960, he voted against 
outlawing the poll tax 12 times. 
Now he supports the new anti
poll tax amendement.
The 1960 National Democratic 
platform favored sit-in demonstra
tions. His state senate platform 
favored enforcement of laws de
signed to protect private property 
from physical occupation.
On November 27, 1963, he said: 
We have talked long enough in 
this country about equal rights. 
It is time now to write the next 
chapter and to write it in the 
book of law. But the Texas Ob
server quoted him as saying: This 
civil rights program ... is a farce 
and a shaman effort to set up a 
police state in the guise of liberty. 
I am opposed to that program. I 
fought it in Congress. I am op
posed to the anti-lynching bill be
cause the federal government has 
no more business enacting a law 
against one form of murder than 
another.
It is obvious that Lyndon Baines 
Johnson is running on a platform 
of hypocrisy.

Camp Counselor Scorns 
Tartan Coverage
Editor, the Tartan:
To Whoever was responsible for 
the front-page article about Fresh
man Camp (September 16):
For shame! How could you al
low such a shameful article to be 
printed? Where is your pride in 
doing a good job?
To begin with, how could you 
ignore giving recognition to the 
co-chairman of Freshman Camp, 
April Soule? How could you be 
so thoughtless?
Second, how could you be so in
accurate with detail? Dramats Did 
NOT put on the skits. The coun
selors did! And the counselors did 
not just POSE questions to be dis
cussed, but worked hard and long 
on an exceptional intellectual and 
enlightening program. And the 
counselors did not TRY to arouse 
spirit, like it was a dying animal. 
Your sentence seemed to negate 
the fun at Camp. And for further 
reference, there in only ONE 
Scottie Dog.
Third, may I say, in the most 
polite words that I can, that the 
choice of picture under the title 
of the article was indeed damning. 
I doubt whether Mr. McCabes 
speech or any other facet of Camp 
could have bored anyone. Maybe 
someone on your staff has a 
strange sense of humor.

To shed light on this point, I recently took a survey in 
downtown Pittsburgh and acquired the following results:
Q. Do Liberals eventually wantf
I
to abolish established churches? 
A. Seven said no, 11 said yes.
Q. Do liberals generally advo
cate more reforms than Conserva
tives? A. Ten said no, eight said 
yes.
Q. Is the ultimate goal of Lib
eralism to produce a Socialist 
state? A. Four said no, 14 said 
yes.
These and other questions were 
asked to both male and female 
adults on the corner of Smithfield 
and Forbes Street in downtown 
Pittsburgh. This survey had its 
limitations, but I think one can 
safely generalize that many have 
mistaken notions about Liberal
ism.
To understand Liberalism as a 
political philosophy, one should 
first comprehend the liberals 
view of the nature-of man.
Liberalism, unlike Conserva
tism, does not view man as a 
wicked, essentially irrational 
creature in need of many re
straints, but rather as an ignor
ant, rational being in need of 
knowledge. Liberalism, as an 
attitude toward life, is more 
skeptical, experimental, ration
al, and free than Conservatism. 
Instead of binding the individ
ual with he restraints of so
ciety, church, and tradition, he 
is set free to increase his sum 
of knowledge and to strive for 
enlightenment in order to cre
ate a good society.
Basically then, the Liberal 
wants progress. Only by his own 
efforts can man create himself a 
beter life on earth.
Concerning government, J. 
Schapiro, in Liberalism: Its
Meaning and History, points out 
that in the liberal view, the chief 
end of government is to uphold 
the liberty, equality, and security 
of all citizens. This government 
has to be dynamic according to 
the way in which Liberalism is 
defined. Progress will be achieved 
in this government through re
forms. However, these reforms 
are not the product of extremism.
The liberal temper blends 
idealism with practical consid
eration. Ideals are to serve as
f
guides to ultimate ends. These 
are to be attained, not all at 
once but one by one, cautious
ly, moderately, yet continuous
ly. Time, place and history de
termine the pace as well as the 
method of progress. As Scha
piro points out, the liberal way 
is the way of the inevitability 
of gradualness in the progress 
of mankind.
It is the general consensus of 
the public that President Johnson 
is a liberal. However, one may 
ask how President Lyndon John
son fits into the picture of Lib
eralism that has been described.
President Johnson has made 
his reputation in politics as an 
adjuster of conflicting political 
viewpoints and pressures, and 
as a manipulator of people to 
gain his objectives in politics. 
The President was an ardent 
New Dealer, whose first job in 
federal service was as head of a 
youth organization in the 
thirties.
The record indicates that Presi
dent Johnson shifts views on par
ticular issues. He had opposed a 
federal civil-rights law before | 
and yet he literally carried the ** 
recent bill through Congress. His 
views on union power have also 
been extremely variant.
For the most part, President 
Johnson believes federal policies 
and programs have been success
ful and should continue to ex
pand.
It is clear that President 
Johnson isnt a clear-cut lib
eral, or at least he keeps this 
part of himself extremely wellconcealed. He expounds no lib
eral theories and his methods of 
accomplishing. his goals are not 
liberal. However, it appears 
that many of his goals are with 
liberal intentions (civil-rights, 
anti-poverty bill, foreign aid), 
even though they appear hidden.
It appears to me that he best 
way to describe President John
son is as an aggressive, shrewd 
politician who will manipulate 
enough progressive legislation 
through Congress to enable him
self to be elected in the Novem
ber election.

at non-existent straws to clinch; 
his argument.
The article correctly quotes 
Senator Goldwater as saying that 
mans development, in both its 
spiritual and material aspects, is 
not something that can be di
rected by outside forces. Pane
pinto then says that Goldwaters 
complete denial of the influence 
of outside forces upon man erases 
such institutions as schools, 
churches, labor unions, and even 
the government of our society. 
At this point, the author says 
that Senator Goldwaters theory 
tends to collapse. But the ar
gument is fallacious. The various 
institutions are NOT outside for
ces, but simply instruments of 
man to better provide for his own 
development. Goldwaters theory 
doesnt collapse at all.
The article also implies that 
the conservative belief of many 
people living in different genera
tions are Goldwaters beliefs. For 
example, he implies that Gold
water approves of the idea that 
an aristocracy must rule the 
people. The Senator has never 
even suggested this. He believes 
in limited power and has stated 
that power corrupts.
Panepinto also suggests that 
Goldwater agrees that this is 
the best of all possible worlds, 
and that he therefore says it is 
best to leave well enough alone. 
This is again wrong. Goldwater 
is not willing to leave well 
enough alone, but wants to ap
ply established truths to the prob
lems of the contemporary world. 
He holds that we must and do 
have certain inviolable principles 
which should govern solutions to 
the problems of a changing so
cial, economic, and political land
scape.

Fly-Catching Becomes New Fad
by Sue Attinson
Fly-catching is Carnegie Techs newest athletic pursuit. 
Armed with bottles, screens, boxes, and nets, the biology 
students of M-19 have spent several days at the garbage 
dumps of Skibo and More wood .?
They are collecting flies for labo
ratory experimentaion.
Theyve discovered that flycatching requires great dexterity, 
keen eye-sight and rapid eyehand coordination. Maneuverabil
ity between the pails is also im
portant.
Some use the temptation 
method of fly-catching. They fill 
jars with jam and liver and leave 
them at the garbage dump over
night. Others attempt to capture 
an alighting fly with cup and 
cardboard.
The best method, however, ap
pears to be the open-fisted ap
proach. According to students, 
one fly-catcher has captured six 
flies a session using this method.
A descriptive source reports 
that my arm hangs limp; then I 
suddenly reach up and grab.
The biology students supply

appropriate homes for their fly 
prisoners. Many use jars and gal
lon jugs with cheesecloth roofing.
Others have converted boxes 
into screened fly rooms; some 
have built airy-screened cages.
One student applied carpentry 
techniques and built a ply-wood 
house with two doorways and in
terior shelving. These homes and 
their occupants are kept in the 
MMCC biology laboratory.
Students complain that flycatching is difficult but that transferral of flies from their tempo
rary to their permanent quarters 
is even more trying.
There may be many captive 
flies in the biology lab, the stu
dents report, but here are many 
more that didnt quite make it.

0Early Tartan Threat Squashed; 
Scots Gain Final Clory, 27-0
*
Tartan Photo by Martin ShenkerWiz to Zak in draw play
by Ron Bidula
Carnegie Tech and the College of Wooster inaugurated 
an all Scottish gridiron rivalry last Saturday at Tech Field 
with the Scots from Ohio Blanking the Tartans 27-0. The
Woosterites scored all their points^----------------------------------------------------*
in the first half for their second 
win of this year.
The cookie crumbled in favor 
of the Tartans at the outset when 
Wooster fumbled Jack Loves 
opening kick-off and junior Bill 
Dengler recovered for Tech at 
the Scot 29. After a five yard 
penalty against Wooster, Wis
niewski pitched to Dave Gilchrist 
who circled right end for six 
yards and a first down at the 18.
The Scots then stopped Dick Merril for no gain, but were off-side 
on the next play when Wis was 
smeared going back to pass. On 
the 13, Wis threw a screen to Zak 
for a short gain before Wooster 
shot off-side again on the next 
play. The penalty gave CIT a 
first down on the enemy 6.
Tech appeared TD-bound as 
Zak plunged to the 3, but the 
rugged Wooster defense stopped 
Gilchrist twice for no gain and 
knocked a desperation fourth pass 
out of the hands of Jim Black at 
the goal line. The Scots took 
over with 10:21 left.
Interceptions Kill Drives
Wooster punted after three 
plays netted only three yards, and 
once again the Tartans appeared 
headed toward paydirt. After two 
running plays moved the ball to 
the Wooster 37, Wis hit senior 
end, Bill Coleman, at the 23.
Tech fans groaned on the next 
play, however, as Jim Black
slipped, trying to gather Wiss 
pass. Wooster defensive end Bruce 
Vandersall intercepted the aerial 
and outran the CIT pursuers for 
and eighty-five yard TD at 6:50. 
The conversion was good and 
Wooster lead 7-0.
The bouncing kick-off eluded 
the Tech front line and Jim 
Black covered it on his own 6. 
Tech quickly moved to the 20 
with Wis sneaking for two, hand
ing off to Gilchrist for 4, and 
then passing to Jim Black at the 
sideline. Wooster stiffened at the 
25. Merrill was stopped for no 
gain on the next play. On the 
second and third downs Wis was 
dropped twice for long losses 
when he couldnt spot his re
ceivers quickly enough. Gilchrist 
then kicked short to the CIT 32.
Scot halfback Jeff Zorn was 
dropped for a five yard loss be
fore freshman halfback Mike Gor
don took a pitchout and burst 
through the Tech secondary for 
a thirty-seven yard TD at 2:36. 
The PAT was good and the Tar
tans trailed 14-0.
Tech started rolling again af
ter Meriill fought his way back 
to the 44 on the kick-off. Two 
consecutive first downs brought 
the ball to the Scot 30 from 
where two plays later Wis hit 
Jim Black on the 18. Jim couldnt 
hold on to the elusive pigskin,

however, and defender Jeff Zorn 
stole the ball and returned it to 
the 21 as the quarter ended.
Wooster wasted no time as the 
second quarter began. After mov
ing on the ground to their own 
40, Rod Dingle scooted around 
left end all the way for a sixty 
yard score. The kick split the up
rights and the score was now 
21-0 at 14:03.
A rout seemed to be in the 
making after the kick-off as Wis 
fumbled the snap on first down 
and Wooster again had the ball 
at the Tech 34. Coach Gasparellas 
defense stiffened, however, and 
CIT took over four plays later 
at their 28.
Tech couldnt come up with the 
big play. After Merill and Gianni 
twice moved the sticks, the Scots 
stiffened and took over on downs 
at their 40. Wooster then moved 
60 yards in eight plays for their 
fourth TD. The drive was cli
maxed by a fifteen yard Poling 
to Dingle aerial at 5:19 in the 
coffin comer, for the sophomore 
halfbacks second score of the day. 
The kick seemed good, but a 
penalty moved the ball to the 
7, from where the kick failed. 
Wooster now lead 27-0.
Game Slows
Neither team could mount an 
offensive in the last five minutes 
of the half. CIT shuffled its quar
terbacks, but neither Hubka or 
Wis could come up with the long 
bomb.
Kiltie bands from both schools 
highlighted the halftime activi
ties. The yellow and black Mac
Leod Plaid provided an interest
ing contrast to the red and black 
Carnegie Plaid. Bagpipers from 
the two bands tickled the ear
drums of the spectators during 
the show and the CIT cheerlead
ers performed their ever-present 3:46. The Scots took over and
cartwheels.
The second half was a defen
sive duel with neither team able 
to score. Wooster intercepted an 
errant Tech pass on the third 
play of the half but couldnt move 
consistently. After the two teams 
traded units, Wooster moved to 
the CIT 38 with some hard run
ning by senior fullback Walt 
Blaich, but the Tech defense 
forced the Scots to kick short to 
the CIT 16. On the next play 
Chuck Zak came up with the best 
Tech run of the day as he bursted 
through the Scot secondary for 21 
yards to the Tech 37. Zak and 
Gilchrist then carried the ball on 
short runs to the enemy 46. Wis 
then threw to RayMtz at the 38 
for the third consecutive Tech 
first down, and Dick Merrill broke 
through the middle of the line 
for ten yards. On the next play 
he gathered in a Wianiewski pass 
at the 15 for another first down.
Then the drive fizzled. After 
a run, an incomplete pass, and a 
bootleg left Tech still short of a 
FD, Wis was smeared in his backfield at the Wooster 20. The Scots 
took over with 1:20 left in the 
third period.
CIT forced a Wooster punt as 
the last period began. Freshman 
Dick Bell followed some hard 
blocking from his own 40 to the 
Wooster 38 on the return. Tech 
quickly moved to the Wooster 11 
on a long gainer by Merrill. 
Wooster took over at 12:20.
Tech forced Wooster to punt 
twice in the next three minutes 
and resorted to the long pass in 
a vain attempt to dent the score
board at least once. In attempting 
to punt a third time from his 
40, Blaich was dropped by Hay 
Metz and Tech had the ball at 
the Scot 44. Hubka moved the 
Tartans to the 10 before the last 
Tech offensive bogged down at
ran out the clock.
The game was one of complete 
frustration for CIT. At least four 
Tech drives deep into Wooster 
territory were stopped short of 
the goal line as the Scot defense 
toughened in these key situations. 
Tech ran eighty-two plays to 
Woosters forty-five and won a 
moral victory in the statistics. 
The only statistic that really 
counted, though, was the one on 
the scoreboard.
Tech had nothing to be 
ashamed of and needs only to 
balance its air and ground at
tacks to win. One encouraging 
factor is the fine student sfippoat 
being given the team at home.
Tech plays its third home game 
of the season against another 
Ohio team, Case Tech of Cleve
land, next Saturday afternoon at
TechField.

Intramural football has begun 
again, and the perrennial football 
powers should be back on top 
once again. ATO, the Grads, and 
BTP are the favorites, along with 
SAE and SN.
ATO in the Eagles League 
Alpha Tau Omega is the favorite 
1 to take first place in the Eagles 
League, but they will have to fight 
off GSIA Gold to take it. The 
ATO's lost quarterback Steve 
Foels via graduation, but they 
have a fine replacement in junior 
Bud Higginbotham. Gerry Unger, 
Tom Kline and Frank Oliver will 
help make ATO tough for anyone 
to beat.
The only team that may be able 
to swing it for the league cham
pionship is GSIA. They have a 
few holdovers from last years 
unbeatable Grad Eagles, who, 
fortunately for the undergrads, 
broke up for this years football 
season. Included in these hold
overs is Joe Lees, possibly the 
best defensive half in the school.
Blacks Top Grid Team
The top Grad team this vear 
will be GSIA Black, who 
should coast to their league chafnpionship. The only fight in this 
league will be between DU and 
BSR for second place.
The Grad Nods, another good 
graduate team, will have a lot of 
trouble pushing BTP out of first 
place in the Steelers League. 
With QB Lee Collins returning, 
the Betas will be a strong con
tender. But he Nods, paced by 
Don Shockey. will not go down 
easily.
SAE-SN to Dogfight
The closest battle for a league 
championship will be in the 
Giants League where SAE and 
SN will stage a dogfight for first. 
When they play each other near 
the end of October, the game will 
be a duel between quarterbacks
John Blue of SN and Harvey 
Gammon of SAE.
If there are any sleepers this J " "
year, they would be the Finks in ' 1
the Steelers League, Tau Delt in \ 5 I |-.t
the Eagles, or the Cellar Dwellers 1||fi|>x  *
in the Giants League.
The Cellar Dwellers are the #
first respectable freshman team to 
come along in quite a while. They 
hit hard, but their lack of exprobably keep them 
out or playoffs. JB*
