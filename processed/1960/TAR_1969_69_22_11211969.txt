Andreas Papandreou, Exiled Greek Leader 
Delivers Lectures on Freedom and Society
Dr. Andreas S. Papandreou, 
exiled Greek political leader, de
livered three Fairless Memorial 
Lectures at C-MU Nov. 17, 18 and 
19. Charging that democracy in 
modern societies is largely a fic
tion, Dr. Papandreou proposed a 
decentralization of the social de
cision-making process, in his 
lecture Monday, Democracy: 
Myth and Reality.
He deplored the loss of personal 
liberty and effective popular so
vereignty in contemporary socie
tyEast and Westand outlined 
the basic conditions necessary to 
establish an effective democracy.
Discussing his decentralization 
plan, the economist stated we 
must accept the fact that political 
power is exercised by a few cen
ters of power while general plan
ning is a necessity in advanced so
cieties. Nevertheless, a planning 
process can be defined which is 
both decentralized and demo
craticin our sense.
To be democratic, he said, a 
modern political system must sat
isfy three basic requirements. The 
ruling coalition should be a bal
anced representation of regional
and occupational groups or or
ganizations in the society. The po
litical processes within these or
ganization members, a reductive 
process which should be carried 
to the smallest unit in the organ
ization, and hence to the citizen. 
Finally, the citizen must be an ac
tive, willing and informed partici
pant in the political process.
Planning in this system, he con
tinued, could be achieved demo
cratically. First, there would be 
balanced representation of region
al and occupational organizations 
in the formulation of the plans 
targets and the selection of meth
ods of implementation. Second, 
implementation of relevant as
pects of the plan would rely heavi
ly on the active and willing parti
cipation of the regional and occu
pational groups.
Such a democracy, said Papan
dreou, assumes certain prereq
uisites: personal liberty of the 
citizens; a demanding standard 
of literacy and culture; no large 
income inequities; access to mass 
media, and equalitariansim with 
no prejudice.
Admitting that this ideal is preTHE TARTAN...
will resume publication Tues. Dec. 2
sently beyond us. Papandreou 
maintained that the solution is 
nonetheless available in princi
ple.
The main difficulty, he said, is 
the highly centralized structure 
of command that is characteristic 
of our contemporary societies.
Pointing to the growth of the 
power of the state, Papandreou 
stated? Oddly enough, this 
sweeping expansion of the power 
of the state has been carried out 
in the name of popular sovereignty 
or in the name of the nation.
He quoted Bertrad de Jouvenal: 
There is now a collective being, 
which is of far greater impor
tance than individuals: clearly, 
then, the right transcendent of 
sovereignty belongs to none other. 
It is the sovereignty of the nation 
which is ... a very different thing 
from the sovereignty of the peo
ple.
Furthermore, Papandreou con
tinued, the goals of the nation have 
become the special preserve of 
the establishment, or ruling coali
tion. which has a monopoly of the 
knowledge and understanding ne
cessary for deciding and achiev
ing the goals.

the matter is that in contempo( AndredasP nd pous ,EDr. Andreas S. Papandreou
New Center Proposed 
For C-MU, Pitt Faculty
by Pamela Horner
A three million dollar country club for the joint use of the faculty 
members of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity has been proposed for an eight-acre site adjacent to the C-MU cam
pus near Squirrel Hill.
The property, known as the Speare Mansion, is owned by C-MU.
The original impetus for the facility came from William K. Fitch, 
former chairman of the Board of Dravo Corporation. Desiring to do 
something for the city, hopefully in the educational area, he approach
ed Pitt and C-MU with his idea and an understanding was reached to ex
plore the matter.
There had been earlier faculty surveys aimed at a discussion of a 
faculty club, but Mr. Fitch made the first concrete proposal.
The Speare property was suggested, and Mr. Fitch was favorably 
impressed, believing that it was an excellent location.
Less than one year ago. he made his offer of $1 million, surround
ing it with these conditions:
1- Each school must raise an equal sum of moneyi.e., $1 million each.
2. Appropriate zoning must be obtained.
3. The schools must show that they are financially capable of operat
ing such a facility.
4 It must be of Georgian or early Colonial architecture.
It was also stipulated that it must be a center for all faculty mem
bers and their families, regardless of race, creed, etc.
The center, to be called the William K. Fitch Faculty Center, will 
include a large, one-story structure with an indoor outdoor swimming 
pool, wading pool, outdoor tennis courts, paddle tennis courts, picnic 
and play areas, and a parking lot.
Mr Fitch died this summer before plans could be completed. His 
will grants the schools the money, but only if they raise their part by March, 1970.
Both schools are investigating ways of raising the money. An archi
tect has drawn up plans for the building. As of now, the zoning change 
nas not been applied for.
If the center is built, it will be the first facultv club of its kind in the nation.
Senate Still Favors Closing Skibo 
Appropriates Money for Astronomy
A lot of business was dealt with during the one 
and one-half hour session of the Student Senate on 
Tuesday afternoon. The meeting began with reports 
from several committee chairman. The General 
Campus Committee reported that it had investigated 
the advertising which the Sheraton Hotels wished to 
distribute on campus and had found the discount 
supposedly available to students legitimate. Steve 
Rosenberg of the Ad-Hoc Birth Control Committee 
announced that a Birth-In would be held on campus 
on Nov. 25. at which time a Planned Parenthood 
speaker would address students and literature 
would be distributed. The proposed birth control 
handbook will be ready around the beginning of next 
semester. The chairman of the Student Affairs Com
mittee told senators that a survey would be conduct
ed on campus with regard to what students feel to 
be the most important extra-curricular activities 
available.
The first item of old business turned out to be the 
subject of greatest discussion during the meeting. A 
motion had been tabled during an earlier session 
which dealt with the use of Skibo. To prevent stu
dents from being unintentionally barred from oncampus activities, the motion said that activities 
catering to an off-campus audience as well as stu
dents should be opened only to persons with student 
cards and to outsiders with tickets to ihe event. Sub
sections of the motion stated that these restrictions 
might be relaxed in certain instances, and that in 
general only 25 per cent of any audience should be 
from off the campus. One senator stated that this 
would prevent local radio stations from telling the 
public to come one, come all, to Skibo. Dean 
Swank pointed out, however, that there are four 
series which draw very few students and for which 
the outside audience should not be restricted to 25 
per cent of the seats. Eventually, Carter Allen 
amended the subsection to read, The Activities 
Board should be consulted as to the number of seats 
available to outsiders when an activity is held on 
campus which relates to off-campus matters. The
amended motion passed 34-0-1.
Next, the chairman of the Finance Committee 
announced that a $200 appropriation for the schools 
Astronomy Club has been offered and moved that 
the appropriation be accepted. This motion was 
passed after the senators had been convinced that 
the new telescope that was to be built with this mon
ey was needed.
Ken Friend moved to untable a parking motion 
which stated that the Student Government petition 
the administration to, through the enforcement of 
the campus police, free extra parking space for stu
dents during the week preceding Spring Carnival. 
Despite the argument that there is little parking 
space to free, this motion passed 33-0-4.
The main item of new business was the question 
of whether $300 be available to have Bill Baird, a 
well-known proponent of birth control and legal 
abortion, speak on campus. Against a motion to this 
effect, it was argued that the Senates resources 
were badly dwindling, that another speaker could 
probably be attracted for a smaller amount, and 
that such an appropriation might jeopardize the 
Birth Control Handbook which should become avail
able in February. The motion was passed, however, 
since Mr. Baird is felt to the best speaker available 
on this topicExecutive Council vetoed this motion 
with the recommendation that Activities Board sup
port this.
Then, several items were considered in quck suc
cession. A motion to have C-MU participate in the 
annual Whos Who of American College Students 
was denied by a vote of 7-18-8. Joe Seltzers motion 
that the name of the professor teaching each course 
should be published prior to registration each term 
was passed by a unanimous vote and a recommen
dation to this effect will be made to the administra
tion that student counseling services are consider
ed inadequate was passed by a vote of 27-0-5. Final
ly, several other motions were tabled, and the meet
ing was adjourned at about 6:15 p.m.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Editorial
Be Aware of the Pill!
The Birth Control Committee will begin its series design
ed to inform the campus community about birth control met
hods and counseling Tuesday with a presentation by the Plan
ned Parenthood Center. We think this program to be of im
portance to both male and female students, if not now, in the 
future.
Too many unwanted pregnancies result from ignorance 
about contraceptive methods. Often, desperate females on cam
pus have turned to phony doctors for abortive treatments. 
Not only are these operations performed under unsanitary con
ditions, but the necessary psychological supportive programs 
are not concurrently conducted.
These last resorts are not necessary. In Pittsburgh there are 
many ways of obtaining legitimate professional help in these 
cases. The pill can also be obtained from many physicians 
without much trouble. The problem lies in the fact that too 
few known where to obtain information about the various 
birth control methods.
The Birth Control Committee hopes to remedy this prob
lem. By making available a handbook which will explain var
ious contraceptive methods and current abortion laws, they 
hope to inform the campus community, in particular, about 
ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy.
In addition, they will sponsor many speakers on campus. 
An effort has been made to bring Bill Baird, a doctor who is 
presently appealing a conviction in Massachusetts for showing 
birth control devices to persons under 18, to campus. Although 
the Committee was appropriated $300 by Student Senate in its 
Tuesday meeting, the allocation was vetoed by the Executive 
Council because the Council felt that the funds should come 
out of the Activities Board budget. At the next meeting of 
Senate, we urge this appropriation to be made, regardless of 
whose budget the money must come from.
Our generation has been fortunate in having access to the 
pill. It has permitted us to have sexual relationships without 
the constant fear of pregnancy. Unfortunately, too many peo
ple, uninformed or misinformed about what the pill can and 
cannot do, have faiLI to take advantage of it.
We urge eviryor.e to attend the lecture and film presenta
tion Tuesday, as well as future programs. Ignorance in this 
area can only result in personal disaster.
Large Stink is Raised
Editor, The Tartan:
I was greatly amused by Ed
ward Decis volte face in his re
ply to Frederick in the Novem
ber 18 issue of the Tartan. I 
refrained from writing any com
ments on Decis earlier article 
in the Tartan (Let's Have Peace 
Now . . ., November 7), despite 
the articles utter naivete and 
sophitic reasoning (which irrita
ted me not a little), because of
the same sense of decency which 
would restrain from calling atten
tion to, say, a pile of dog turds. 
However, when the advocate of 
the right to dissent (however 
specious his arguments are) on 
the 7th becomes the advocate of 
ostracism for differing views on 
the 18th (Then we could have, 
ostracized you.), a stink too 
large to be ignored is raised.

Results of Drug Survey, Ready Next Spring
Editor, The Tartan:
As Principal Investigator of 
the drug research project cur
rently being conducted by several 
members of the Department of 
Psychology and the Counseling 
Center I would like to reply to 
the inquiry of Mr. Dale Partin 
(Nov. 14) concerning the results 
of the survey. As reported in the 
Tartan on September 23rd, 
page 3, we had hoped to have an 
interim report available to the stu
dents in December. We are now 
aiming at the early Spring. Com
puter difficulties and the sheer 
quantity of the date, plus the fact
that we can only spend a small 
portion of our time on the study 
are slowing the project. We are 
as eager to complete the research 
as a'nyone.
If members of the University
community have questions con
cerning drug usage or the sur
vey, the project team will make 
every attempt to answer them.

Prejudiced, but Do Check ID's
Editor. The Tartan:
I take strong exception to the reference to the coloured high 
school students jumping in front of the juke box in Skibo. This is a 
biased and prejudiced statement because the white high school stu
dents make more of a nuisance in Skibo. Perhaps Frederick condones 
their behavior and presence because they are white!
Besides this, I support his plea for checking of IDs.

Up with People To Play in Pgh.
Up With People, an original 
musical show featuring an inter
national cast of 120 youth, will 
be in Pittsburgh November 24 
and 25, appearing at the Civic 
Arena at 8:00 p.m.
Up With People began four 
years ago and has expanded from 
a group of 150 to a force that in
cludes three full time traveling 
casts and hundreds of regional 
operations invonving 60,000 
youth.
The cast presents their demon
stration through a musical show 
exploding with enthusiasm. The 
show is an expression of their 
aspirations for the future; a de
monstration committed to a posi
tive involvement. It is an enthus
iastic approach to the issues fac
ing society and a desire to see 
them solved. These young peo
ple see themselves as a catalyst 
to spark people into a new way of 
thinking. National Director of Up 
With People, Blanton Balk, says, 
Up With People is an illumina
ting sign of the times. It is the
will of the people to rebuild the 
world, not with programs or poli
tics, but with a new step of growth 
in each man.
With their original music, Up 
With People has spanned the 
globe starting in 1965 with an in
vitation to Japan. Since then they 
have performed through much of 
Asia, South America, and Europe 
They have criscrossed America a 
dozen times playing on hundreds 
of campuses, in stadiums, and on 
city streets.
It Aint Necessarily So
by STEVE JURMAN
One day in June, 1958, a civilian carpenter 
named Joel Willard walked into a laboratory at Fort 
Detrick, Maryland, to change some light bulbs. 
Several days later he was dead. The local paper 
listed the cause of death as an occupational ill
ness . . . described by a Fort Detrick official as a 
respiratory disease. The real cause was visceral 
anthrax, a deadly disease normally carried by 
sheep.
Fort Detrick, opened in strict secrecy in 1943, 
is the Armys center for development and produc
tion of biological warfare agents. Such agents 
have more potential for destruction than ther
monuclear weaponry.
The biological warfare story opened early in 
World War II when the Allies discovered that 
Germany and the Soviety Union had both been en
gaged in BW preparations for several years. Be
tween 1940 and 1943 Great Britain, Canada, 
and the US all began research into the offensive 
and defensive aspects of BW.
The Army decided in 1943 that germ war
fare was feasible, soon setting Detrick into full 
operation. Answering presistent charges that it had 
waged germ warfare against North Korea, the Army 
announced in 1959 that in 1952 it had the weapons 
to launch such an attack, but that they were never 
sent abroad. Today the Army has, among other, stock
piled and ready for use, anthrax, the pulmonary 
variety of which can kill in 24 hours, brucellois, 
encephalomyelitis, a highly infectious disease of 
the central nervous system, bubonic and pneumonic 
plague, which wiped out one third of Europe as the 
Black Death (and is over 90 per cent fatal), and 
Rift Valley and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, 
deadly infectious tick-borne diseases. Resistance to 
the latter is almost nonexistent among Asians and 
work on them boomed when the Vietnam in
volvement began. In addition to these, certain bac
terial toxins are preparable and presumably stock
piled, including Botulinus Toxin, eight ounces of 
which are sufficient to wipe out the entire popula
tion of the world!
Detrick has a good safety record considering 
the nature of its work, but, as with the chemical
corps, there have been incidents which make the 
Armys concern for civilian welfare seem dubious. 
Detricks relations with the Public Health Service 
in Maryland have not been regular and separate in
cidents involving pneumonic plague, meningitis, 
typhois fever and anthrax were all handled with ap
parently more concern for secrecy than public 
safety. A retired public health official also rela
ted occurences involving tubercular  like lung 
lesions in Detrick personnel and a mysterious death 
in which no autopsy report was ever announced. 
He termed the occurences funny.
The Army has discovered ways to improve on 
nature. Germs can be mixed with resistance low
ering chemicals to increase the susceptibility of 
victims. They can be made more virulent and hardly 
by genetics; they can be made more infectious by 
decreasing their size, thus bypassing certain nat
ural body defenses; they can be coated with gela
tin to retain potency longer.
Biological agents can be delivered in many 
ways. They can be delivered overtly by artillery 
or aerial bombs; they can be sprayed by supersonic 
aircraft (the apparatus has been perfected). 
Much research has been conducted on insects as 
delivery systems for plague, anthrax, malaria, yellow 
fever, cholera and others. Studies of the pre
vailing winds of the earth have been made, parti
cularly the monsoons which periodically blow over 
China. Submarine delivered disease into the costal 
currents has been suggested and probably investi
gated. Disease could conceivably be transmitted on 
the webbed feet of migratning ducks.
US POLICY ON BIOLOGICAL WARFARE HAS 
NEVER BEEN SPELLED OUT AND IT IS NOT 
KNOWN WHETHER BIOLOGICAL AGENTS ARE 
STORED OVERSEAS. Presumably they are, as are 
chemical agents, and presumably the policy on use 
of them is the same as that for chemicals, that they 
may be used in a first strike in conventional sit
uations on presidential order.
Many questions exist in regard to CBW.
The question exists as to the safety of develop
ing, producing, and stockpiling chemicals and biologicals. Many accidents are recorded; probably 
more are not. Considering the extremely deadly

rary society . . . the citizen has 
been alienated not only from all 
power, but also from even a rea
sonable, sensible understanding 
of the processes that hold the key 
to his future...
Dr. Papandreou attacked the 
role of the modern political party 
in the centralization of power. 
Party discipline, he said, has ren
dered the legislature an instru
ment of the executive, so that vot
ers must now approve or disap
prove of a party and a program 
when they vote.
With his vote the citizen deliv
ers to a party both legislative and 
executive functions. He is a sov
ereign citizen for just that day, 
returning to his role as subject 
the moment after he his cast his 
ballot, he said.
In addition, the Establishment 
uses the party machine to control 
the party; all the citizen gets to 
vote for is the slate of candidates 
chosen by the machine.
Asserting that in an effective 
democracy a balance must be 
maintained between popular sov
ereignty and personal liberty, 
Papandreou said, Our age is 
characterized by a sweep of popu
lar sovereignty (or rather na
tional sovereignty) at the expense 
of personal liberty. Such a situa
tion, he said, undermines both 
and is historically unstable.
Industrial Society: 
Progress or Regress?
Speaking Tuesday, Dr. Papan
dreou warned that modern indus
trial societies that have become 
ends in themselves are threaten
ing mans freedom.
Technological change that held 
the hope of mans freedom has 
imposed upon him a more subtle 
but tenacious form of servitude, 
he said.
Papandreou declared that the 
modern industrial system serves 
ends shaped mostly by its own re
quirements and no longer inde
pendent of the profit and growth 
requirements of the modern cor
porate giant.
The machine no longer serves 
man, but man the machine, he 
said.
Quoting Herbert Marcuse, Pap
andreou said that the extent to 
which industrial civilization 
transforms the object world into 
an extension of mans mind and 
body makes the very notion of 
alienation questionable.
The people recognize them
selves in their commodities, he 
continued. They find their soul 
in their automobile, hi-fi set, splitlevel home, kitchen equipment. 
The very mechanism which ties 
the individual to his society has 
changed, and social control is an
chored in the new needs which it 
has produced.
Noting that this massive, ex
pert manipulation of the publics 
values raises some very funda
mental and damaging questions 
about the productivity and effi
ciency of the system, Papan
dreou asserted that the condition 
exists in the U.S. and the Soviet 
Union, even though the USSR is 
not a capitalist society.
If Marx were alive today, he 
would shudder at the Minotaur 
that was built on the vision of a 
stateless, equalitarian society of 
free men, he said.
The economist stated that the 
contemporary establishment is an 
industrial-military complex which 
which not only exercises substan
tial control over the productive 
process but (1) Manages demand 
to assure that what is produced 
will be bought at controlled prices; 
(2) Socializes the research and 
development costs of private en
terprise by putting the burden of 
the costs on the citizens, and (3)
Exerts decisive influence over 
the national defense and foreign 
policy at the expense of domestic 
policy.
He explained that because cor
porate conglomerates cannot 
guarantee removal from the 
market of their planned output at 
controlled prices, the burden falls 
upon the state apparat, which 
through fiscal policy and mone
tary management prevents a 
slump in aggregate demand. Tax
ation is the chosen instrument 
for achieving the objective, Pap
andreou added.
Papandreou declared that in the 
process of taking over a part of 
the public domain, of privatiz
ing social planning, the corpor
ate conglomerates have assumed 
decisive influence over national 
defense and foreign policy. He 
that just as consumers are shaped 
to demand the systems products, 
foreign policy is haped in part to 
absorb the armaments the sys
tem produces, and to finance the 
requisite highly costly technologi
cal advances which, once pro
duced in the defense industry on 
cost-plus cbntracts, spills over to 
serve the appropriately manipu
lated needs of the consumer.
In addition, he said, the modern 
state develops mechanisms for 
settling industrial disputes with
out disruption of the economic pro
cess, and plans related social se
curity measures.
It is characteristic of plan
ning in contemporary capitalsim, he pointed out, that cru
cial areas for community welfare 
are left to their fatethe modern 
city being a prime example.
Summarizing his view of the 
modern state, particularly as it 
exists in the Soviet Union, Pap
andreou said that the citizen will 
be served by the system ... to the 
extent that his welfare contributes 
to the development of a robust 
baseand no more.
It Aint So
xAndredasP ilnG pous LE
and far reaching effects of these agents, are we 
not courting potential disaster?
The question exists as to the necessity of pro
ducing such agents. We have spent billions of 
dollars on missies, bombers, and their nuclear pay
loads until we possess the power to level the com
munist nations many times over. Is this not a real 
and sufficient deterrent?
Lastly the question exists as to the consequen
ces of biological warfare. There is an answer of 
sorts to this question; no one knows the conse
quences. Sayd Dr. Theodor Rosebury, a bacteriol
ogist who once did BW research:
The horrible potentialities of BW that the 
gamesman and the brinksman seem to enjoy play
ing with are modified by uncertainties they seldom 
stress ... it is next to impossible to know before
hand what to expect from a strategic BW attack; 
there is no satisfactory way to test it in advance.
The British infected Gruinard Island in the North 
Atlantic with anthrax during a test in World War 
II. Twenty years later the island was still uninhab
itable. It will remain so for at least another hun
dred years.
Biological attacks could be the doomsday machine 
often seen in fiction writings. Leroy D. Forthergill, onetime chief at Detrick, says of a major BW 
attack:
What would be the consequences? Would new 
and unused zoonotic foci of endemic disease be 
established? Would it creat the basis for possible 
genetic evolution of microorganisms in new direc
tions with changes in virulence for some species? 
Would it create public health and environmental 
problems that are unique and beyond our pre
sent experience?
Says microbiologist Martan Kaplan:  , . . the 
insertion of a new infective elements . . . could pro
duce for an indefinite period an unrecognizable 
and unmanagable world from the standpoint of com
municable diseases.
The destruction of thermonuclear war could be 
trifling compared to the potentialities of tamper
ing with the evolutionary and ecological pro
cesses.
Saturday Review (August 30, 69) sums up the 
depravity of the whole affair.
This (arms) race is being conducted in the 
name of national security, but is actually pro
ducing mutual insecurity, disfiguration of human 
values, and disruption or destruction of programs de
signed to enhance life and the conditions of life.

Freedom in the Age 
of the Superpowers
The insurgence of democratic 
forces in the industrially back
ward countries is a necessary and 
vital step forward in mans strug
gle for freedom, said Dr. Papan
dreou Wednesday.
The real world conflict, he 
maintained, is not between the 
U.S. and the USSRwho in fact 
expand their neo-imperialism un
der the slogan of peaceful coexis
tencebut between the industrial
ly advanced and industrially back
ward countries.
Papandreou described the pro
liferation of a new sovereign na
tions and the creation of new poles 
of world power as changed in the 
positive direction.
Greece has become the first 
Banana Republic on the European 
continent, argued Papandreou.
He charged that the United 
States, fearing the power of dem
ocratic forces in Greece, helped 
precipitate the events which led 
to the present military dictator
ship.
He discerned an imitative ten
dency in the relations between the 
superpowers and their allies. 
When one superpower takes re
pressive measures, the other 
counters. Papandreou stated, 
Despite their superficial differ
ences, the events in Czechoslova
kia are in broad respective a rep
lica of and a response to the events 
in Greece.
To maintain the status quo and 
consolidate their influence within 
their respective spheres, the su
perpowers keep Europe divided 
and the progressive forces 
throughout the post-colonial Third 
World repressed.
The course of ecnomic develop
ment in the poor nations, he said, 
is determined by the growth re
quirements and the strategic in
terests of the superpowers. In
surgence and revolution are the 
natural consequences of this state 
of affairs, he said.
To achieve the radical struct
ural changes necessary, the rev
olutionaries in Third World coun
tries place the political act ahead 
of the economic act.
Unless the United States finds a 
new basis for its international re
lations, the wave of intervention 
abroad will tend to undermine on 
an ever-increasing scale demo
cratic institutions at home.
The isms are dead, Papan
dreou declared. Neither capital
ism nor socialism . . . constitute 
adequate visions for the new gen
eration. The new vision is hu
manistic and seeks a political or
der in which the state is servant 
rather than master. The dom
inant theme of the new genera
tions quest is Mans Freedom.
Dr. Papandreou discussed how 
social planning can be a path to 
this freedom. Of critical impor
tance in choosing social plans is 
the need to free ourselves from 
social and ideiological biases 
which restrict our range of basic 
choices and which mainly serve 
the vested interests of the estab
lishment anyhow. If man is to at
tain greater control over his so
cial environment  and thus a 
greater measure of the freedom 
he desires  he must free himself 
to consider the widest possible 
range of goals and methods in his 
social planning.
Referring to his prescriptions 
for effective democracy in his 
first lecture, Papandreou under
scored the democratic attributes 
necessary in addition to planning 
for man to achieve freedom.
Thus, the necessary and suffi
cient conditions for mans free
dom are social planning, popular 
sovereignty, and personal liberty, 
which are encompassed in demo
cratic, decentralized social plan
ning, he said.
In each society we should 
move toward democratization and 
social planning. Globally, we 
must favor the assertion of the 
sovereignty of nations and the 
creation of new poles of power. 
Ultimately, we should look to a 
United Nations with teeth...
Dr. Papandreou said the des
pite the frightening trends toward 
bipolarity, the continuing divi
sion of Europe, expansionism by 
the super-states and totalitarian
ism, we must retain our opti
mism.
For optimism is the prereq
uisite to action. And action by now 
is not our right, but our duty.

Cast List Announced 
For Scotch and Soda
To all of the people who audi
tioned and were not cast, we would 
like to thank you and say that the 
quality of auditions was superior 
this year to anything in recent 
years. The choices were vert dif
ficult to make, but since the num
ber of people who auditioned was 
also unusual and due to a neces
sary limit on the size of the cast, 
many talented people could not be 
cast. However, you are urged to 
work on any other aspects of the 
show and should there be any fu
ture openings in the cast, you will 
be considered for these parts.
Thank you again.

Summer 1970
John Findley, representing the 
Lisle Fellowship, will be on cam
pus Monday, Nov. 24, to talk with 
students interested in an over
seas summer service project in 
1970. A meeting has been sched
uled with him at 4 p.m. in 57 Skibo.
The Lisle Fellowship, headquar
tered at the University of Michi
gan, pioneered in overseas volun
tary projects following World War 
II. In 1969, the organization con
ducted these international educa
tional educational programs in 
Germany, Bolivia, India and Ja
pan. Mr. Findley will outline pro
grams for summer of 1970 and 
have available information about 
similar projects sponsored by 
other organizations.
For information see Tom Huff 
at 57 Skibo.
The hundreds of active-duty GIs 
who turned up for the March on 
Washington may face disciplinary 
action for doing so. We had to 
sneak off the base and through Ar
lington Cemetery to get here, 
said one GI who is stationed at 
Fort Myer.
Another GI said more than 100 
of his peers at Fort Bragg, N. C., 
were on their way to Washington. 
Most took three-day passes and 
got in car pools, he said.
During the rally, a GI told the 
crowd that if Nixon doesnt bring 
the troops home now he will find 
theyre going to come home all 
by themselves.
Most of the GIs onpenly identi
fied themselves by wearing GI 
for Peace paper caps. One of 
those sporting such a hat on the 
March Against Death was not a 
participant in the Saturday rally. 
He was waiting in the Washington 
Armory in his military uniform to 
be deployed in case of trouble.
He told fellow marchers that if 
he was ordered to use force against 
peace demonstrators, I would 
disobey orders. He said he knew 
of others who felt the same way.
The airman first class said that
everything about the activities of 
the guard in relation to the dem
onstration had been kept very 
quiet to prevent any counter ac
tivities or preparation on the 
other side.
He also had to get his hair cut 
before Mobilization Day becasue 
his commander said his men 
mustnt look like any of the peo
ple involved in the March.

Faculty Senate Backs Policy To End MMCC
On Tuesday, Nov. 11, the Fac
ulty Senate voted 22 to 6 to accept 
the motion submitted by the Edu
cational Policy Council concern
ing the dissolution of several ma
jors in the home economics de
partment. With this decision, the 
Faculty Senate has backed up the 
University policy to phase-out 
MMCC.
The motion stated that C-MU 
should accept no more undergrad
uates in business studies, food and 
nutrition, textiles and clothing, 
and home economics education af
ter the class which enters in Sep
tember, 1969, and no more grad
uate students in home economics 
education.
The administrations position is 
that they have been forced into 
this decision for a number of rea
sons. Enrollment in these majors 
has been dropping over the last 
number of years. They cannot find 
outside funds to help pay for the
cost of the program. And they be
lieve that there are other schools 
who can do the job better than 
C-MU can or will be able to in the 
future if the program continues.
Those who are opposed to the 
present policy feel that there is a 
great need for these fields in the 
world today and there is no analagous school in the Pittsburgh 
area which offers the quality of 
C-MU program. They believe that 
the University is performing an 
important community service and 
that discontinuing these programs 
will hurt both C-MU and the com
munity.
Many of the opposing views to 
University policy were voiced by 
students present at the meeting. 
Students and all other members of 
the campus community may now 
attend Faculty Senate meetings 
and participate in the discussions.
The debate eventually began to 
revolve around several central is
sueswhere does C-MU stand in 
providing professional education 
for women, and is this the best 
program for this particular insti
tution? Dr. Schatz questioned 
whether this University was in the 
position to give women a quality 
education in this field. The faculty 
representative from Mellon Insti
tute said that given the limited 
resources and high goals of the 
University, the task was to decide 
what was the best way to prepare 
women. He felt that the bestplacement of resources to achieve the 
Universitys goals in educating 
women was to put this money and 
effort in the College of Liberal 
Arts and Humanities. Again and 
again, the debate came back to 
the consideration of what was the 
role of the educated women in 
American society.
James Langer, chairman of the 
Faculty Senate, stated that this 
was the first time the faculty has 
had a chance to participate in a 
major decision with long range
consequen es involving C-MUs 
planning. He directed the Senate 
to shoulder its responsibility and 
not evade this decision so as to
keep the responsibility and the 
voice that it brings to the Senate 
regarding future University poli
cy.
The Serpent To Open
The first production in the experimental theater laboratory at the 
Playhouse, Jean Claude Van Itallies The Serpent, will open Thursday, 
Nov. 20, in the Theater Upstairs. Directed by Tom Thomas, The Ser
pent is a metaphor of contemporary society in the Open Theater tradi
tion. The author provides the words and structure while director 
and cast improvise, invent, and interpret in a highly individualized 
creative process.
According to Mr. Thomas, Doing this kind of play enables us to 
work fresh ... to provide the flesh to the bones of the playwrights 
framework. It will be a different Serpent because no minds are thesame.
The Serpent has its origins in Genesis and the Fall and its meaning 
in the present. It makes no attempt at avante-garde confusion, and 
many of its lines are taken directly or adapted from the Old Testament.
The playwrights strong and provocative theatrical images depict 
the infection of violence, calamity, indifference, murder, and probably 
the cause of all these brutalizing war. The play speaks to the audiences 
intellect and insibility as well as to its emotions. It is easily the most 
talked about theater event of the past year.

Help Center Organized To Aid, Rap, Refer To lnform nBirth Control
by LINDA KURTZ
The students of law and medi
cine, in cooperation with the 
students of public health and social 
work, recognizing a need in the 
community for information, just 
someone to talk to, and referral 
to sympathetic professionals, have 
organized the Student Help Cen
ter as an alternative to the im
posing professionalism, moral 
and ethical harrassment, and im
personal treatment people receive 
from the current systems of care. 
There is a need to deal with 
lots of problems up front, in the 
open, to take the fear and guilt 
away, to educate, to ease th(
pain of our people. The Center 
itself is based on the free clinics 
of Berkeley, Boston, and the 
Student Counseling Service at the 
University of Pennsylvania. How
ever, we will not be practicing 
medicine or giving legal coun
sel.
There are four general areas 
within which we operate. First, 
free and knowledgeable informa
tion on sex, contraception, abor
tion (what and where), venereal 
disease, drugs, draft law, bailbond will always be availab.e We 
do not claim to be experts, but 
we do have quicker access to 
some of the information. HopeMENS DORM COUNCIL

fully, those of you who can give 
us insights into drug use, legal 
hassles, etc. will share your ex
periences with us and make us 
better providers.
Secondly, were people to rap 
with. Lots of us are hassled and 
lonely and would appreciate a 
warm but more objective ear. 
For very serious problems we have 
a staff of psychiatrists to advise 
us, and if necessary, take over the 
problem. All of our work is con
fidential and without name or 
record.
Thirdly, we are a referral cen
ter. That is, for medical and 
legal problems per se, we will 
provide the name of a com
petent and sympathic profession
al.
Fourthly, our center is of no 
value if we do not try to alter 
the parts of the systems that pro
vide inadequate, irrelevent, and 
insensitive services and which led 
to the creation of this center in 
the first place.
Because of the nature of the 
Center in dealing with impor
tant problems, we run into the walls 
of unfriendly systems. We are in 
the process of working it out. As 
we grow, well inform you more 
specifically as to where we can 
and cannot, help out. In order to 
help us get it off the ground, we 
need to know what your needs 
are. Please fill out the ques
tionnaire and return it.. .. Though 
we recognize that the needs of 
the University community are not 
at all the same as the high school 
community, black community, 
etc., we need a place to start. 
We are flexible and the possi
bilities are beautiful and infinite.

jointly publish a birth control

Pittsburgh to join in on this ef
fort. The handbook will cover the 
various birth control methods, 
their advantages and disadvan
tages, and their relative effectiv
eness as well as information on 
local abortion laws. The hand
book will probably be available 
for distribution at the beginning 
of second semester. Any students

tee by simply coming to a Sen
ate meeting or giving their name 
to one of the members.

The lampyridae beetle family. 
Delight of small boys. Biological 
light bulb. And prime source of 
raw material for another Du Pont 
innovation.
Luciferase, an enzymatic protein 
with intriguing properties, obtain
able only from fireflies. Luciferin, 
an organic molecule also found in 
fireflies, but synthesizable. Adeno
sine triphosphate (ATP), a common 
energy-yielding substance found in 
all living cells.
Those are the three main ingre
dients in lampyridae's love light. 
And because ATP is common to all 
living cells, university researchers 
discovered they could produce an
artificial glow by mixing jciferin 
and luciferase wherevei life is 
present.
Noting that phenomenon, Du Pont 
scientists and engineers went on 
to develop it into a practical ana
lytical system. Correlating the in
tensity of the artificial "glow with 
the amount of ATP present in 
bacteria, they designed a means of 
measuring the reaction.
The result is the luminescence 
biometerthe first really basic im
provement in bacteria-counting 
methods since the time of Louis 
Pasteur. Rather than waiting days 
for a culture to demonstrate growth 
density, a doctor or technician can
now get a digital readout of bacteria 
concentration in a matter of minutes.
Other potentially lifesaving uses 
for the biometer are being sug
gested every daysuch as diagnos
ing metabolic rates, enzyme de
ficiencies and nerve damage.
Innovationapplying the known 
to discover the unknown, inventing 
new materials and putting them to 
work, using research and engineer
ing to create the ideas and products 
of the futurethis is the venture 
Du Pont people are engaged in.
You can become one of them, 
and advance professionally in your 
chosen field. See your Du Pont

The Executive Board has been 
replaced by the Policy Advisory 
Board as the body advisory to the 
President on policy and other ad
ministrative matters. The mem
bership of this Board, chaired by 
the President, includes the VicePresidents, the Director and As
sociate Director of Mellon Institue, the Treasurer, the Academic 
Deans, and the Dean of Student Affaors% re-resemtomg tje ad$omostration; the Chairman and the 
Vice Chairman of the Faculty Sen
ate, representing the faculty; and 
the President of Student Govern
ment, the Chairman of the Student 
Senate, and the Head of Associ
ated Women Students, represent
ing the students. This member
ship pattern makes available to 
the President the views of admin
istration, faculty, and students on 
issues of concern to the University 
community. Regualr meetings are 
scheduled monthly and special 
meetings as needed.
On Sept. 5, 1969, an Open Let
ter issued to the campus commun
ity referred to the establishment 
of an Emergency Subcommittee 
of the Policy Advisory Board. If 
an emergency occurs, for eample a demonstration which 
threatens to disrupt the normal 
functioning of the University, the 
President will consult with this 
subcommittee, except under ex
treme conditions, before deciding 
what action to take.
Chaired by the President, it in
cludes two Vice Presidents, two 
Academic Deans, two faculty of
ficers, the Dean of Student Af
fairs, and two student officers.
In 1969-70 the members of this 
suxcommittee are: Vice Presi
dents Kibbee and Schatz; Deans 
Cyert and Mullins; Professor 
Langer (Chairman of the Faculty 
Senate) and Professor Lucas
(Vice Chairman); Dean Swank; 
and J. Patrick Cavanaugh (Chair
man of the Student Senate) and Jo
seph Duckworth (President of Stu
dent Government).
ToyotaCorona
the Imported Car of the Year Is also Americas lowest priced hardtop.
So you can save money 
and show good judg
ment at the same time.
There are other comfort
ing thoughts about 
Corona, too. Like deepfoam cushion reclining 
bucket seats, nylon 
carpeting, automatic 
transmission (optional) 
and a quiet, gas sipping 
engine that goes like 
ninety.
