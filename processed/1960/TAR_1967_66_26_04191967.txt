LEN WANETIK
Editor-in-Chie f
Tartan Invites 
New Staff Workers
With the changing of the 
editorial staff of the Tartan 
this week, new Tartan Editor-in-Chief Len Wanetik has 
issued a call urging all inter
ested students to begin work
ing with the new editors as 
soon as possibe.
Wanetik plans to reorganize 
the methods by which the paper 
is produced each week and in
tends to create or expand sev
eral staffs. New workers will be 
needed in a variety of jobs, most 
of them requiring no prior news
paper experience.
A desk staff will be created for 
rewriting of stories; some five 
to ten regular workers will be 
needed to fill out this staff 
which would begin each Sun
day afternoon at about 1 pm. 
Each worker would receive 
several stories to rewrite, in
volving perhaps an hours 
work per person.
The stories then are typed by 
the typing staff. More regular 
typists are needed to prepare 
the stories for final checking.
The news must then be check
ed and corrected, and headlines 
must be written. Headlining re
quires prior newspaper experi
ence, but students will be train
ed for the job. Again five to ten 
regular workers are needed.
The final step in producing a 
newspaper is layout, or designa
tion of placement of the stories 
in the newspaper. Both length 
and subject of stories must be 
considered as news is fitted into 
position.
Interested students are en
couraged to contact the Tar
tan, Box 17, Campus Mail, or 
to come to the Tartan office, 
Skibo 50, any Sunday after
noon. There is a shortage of 
workers in all departments of 
ttie newspaper, and all stu
dents are welcome.
This issue of the Tartan is 
the first under Wanetik's leader
ship. He takes over the head 
position from Richard Sextro, 
who graduates this June.
John Mera, a sophomore elec
trical engineer and former 
Photography Editor, is the new 
Executive Editor of the Tartan. 
The new Managing Editor is 
Larry Sikon, sophomore math 
major, and Tartan Sports Edi
tor this past year.
Suzanne Lindamood, a junior 
home economics major, has 
been named Desk Editor for 
1967-68. Her assistant will be 
Barbara Moses, a freshman in 
natural science, who moved up 
from the Printing Production 
staff.
Freshman Heads Business Staff
Jim Neumeister, a freshman 
civil engineer and former circu
lation manager, has taken over 
as Business Manager. Working 
with him on the business end 
will be Carroll Swarmer, a fresh
man in E&S, as Local Advertis
ing Manager, and Fredda Si
mon, a junior in natural sci
ence, as National Advertising 
Manager.
Jim Janke, a freshman chem
istry major and Tartan sportswriter, has moved up to the 
post of Sports Editor. Mark 
Kaminsky, a freshman physics 
major, will continue as Photo
graphy Editor, a position he 
took over in the middle of this 
year.
Dan Nagln, a freshman in 
AMS, is the new Circulation 
Manager. New Layout Editors 
are Ellen Blissman, a freshman 
P&D, and Carol Shuman, fresh
man humanities. Nancy Young, 
a junior in home economics, is 
the Secretarial Editor, and Hen
rik Lind, freshman EE major, 
is Printing Production Manager. 
Miss Blissman, Miss Young, and 
Mr. Lind all moved up from 
positions on the staffs they now 
head.
News Editors Named
Theree people have been as

ering news. The new News Edi
tor is Tony Lawrence, a sopho
more drama major, who re
places senior Mike Vargo. Work
ing as Assistant News Editors 
will be Linda Pecaites, freshman 
civil engineer, and Rich Ste:ens, 
sophomore EE.
An Editorial Board for the 
new Tartan has also been form
ed. It is mainly a consulting 
body. Sextro and Judy Blrken,

NOW SHOWING
The New York Peace March: 
Tech Students In The Melting Pot
by Linda Pecaites, Assistant News Editor 
NEW YORK, APRIL 15On Central Park West bus after bus pulled up to the 
curb and spilled its sleepy occupants out into the mist-drenched morning. Most looked 
about curiously, but subdued from their nigh t of traveling and the realization that they 
were finally at the site of the peace march. There was little laughing or clowning. Only 
an occasional joke was cracked as the march ers started to head for their meeting places.
Aspart of the Mid-Atlantic 
states section of the ad - hoc 
Spring Mobilization Committee 
against the war, Carnegie Tech 
students from the Foreign Poli
cy Forum sponsored a chartered 
bus to the march. The Universi
ty of Pittsburgh sponsored an
other four buses Saturday night, 
just after midnight, they left 
from the Friends Meeting House 
on Ellsworth Ave. In New York 
the next day, they became part 
of the throng of over 150,000 
people who marched from Cen
tral Park to the United Nations 
Plaza despite the dripping, freez
ing weather.
Once in Central Park, the 
marchers streamed to Sheeps 
Meadow, which looked a loom 
from the lines of police bar
riers set up there, but which 
within an how became com
pletely carpeted with people. 
As each marcher got off the 
bus, he was given a map, his 
groups section letter and an 
agenda of the starting times 
of each section of the parade. 
He was then encouraged firm
ly by one of the hundreds of 
waiting policemen to move 
into the park and to his as
signed area. The organization 
of the march ironically brought 
to mind an army about to 
go into battle.
The groups of demonstrators 
started forming in earnest by
11 am. They had a long, disci
plined wait in store, for it would 
be after 4:30 pm before all the 
marchers would leave the park 
on their way to the UN Plaza.
As the marchers waited; ven
dors selling peanuts, candy, and 
protest buttons circulated about 
the fringes of the crowd. Repre
sentatives from socialist and 
communist organizations gave 
away or tried to sell copies of 
their newspapers and magazines, 
generally unsuccessfully. At 
times the vendors sounded like 
the barkers at a country car
nival, crying out to young men, 
Make a hit with the little lady, 
buy her a copy of the New So
cialist, much to the delight of 
students who usually laughed 
with complete derison.
There were very few earn
est socialists or communists, 
as most of the pro-war com
mentators on the march at
tempt to imply, but rather 
people from possible sociai, 
economic, and political origin 
who all felt the same as one 
young anthropologist who said, 
This is something that you 
just cant bury your head from 
as we did from civil rights, 
Watts, Cuba, the Dominican 
Republic, because it touches 
everyone in some way. You 
wake up in the morning and 
feel sick when you think of 
your country and you have 
to turn your head when you 
see the American flag because 
youre ashamed. This I dont 
want to have to live with and 
this I cant forget. Thats why 
Im marching today.
Students from every major 
college in the east thronged to 
the march. Buses came from as 
far south as Georgia. The vast 
majority of the people, though,Cameron Choir Presents Spring Concert In Oakland
The Carnegie Tech Cameron Choir will present its an
nual Spring Concert on Sunday, April 23, at 8:30 p.m. in 
the Carnegie Music Hall, Oakland. The public is invited and

and Williamsburg, Virginia.
The choir, directed by Asso
ciate Professor Donald Wilkins,

ly for the spring concert. In

the Chariot and Elijah Rock.
Folk Songs Featured 
Featured in the concert will 
be the folk singing groupJohn 
and Sally, composed of John 
Guth, president of the choir, and
Sally Madaras. In addition to 
performing in all tour concerts, 
the group has given concerts at 
W&J, the Pittsburgh Collegiate 
Folksing Contest, in which they 
placed first, several concerts for 
private organizations and par
ties in Pennsylvania and West 
Virginia, and Intercollegiate 
Competition at Lycoming Col
lege this past weekend.
This is Professor Wilkins first 
year as director of the choir. 
Performances of the choir have 
included a winter tour to Col
umbus and Cincinatti, Ohio, the 
spring tour to Virginia, concerts 
for several local groups and 
schools, and the annual Christ
mas assembly and campus car
oling, which concluded in a car
oling party at President Stevers home. The choirs final per

with the Fine Arts choir and

May 13 symphony concert.
were not students. There were 
adult pacifist groups, womens 
clubs, part of the New York 
Democratic party, religious or
ganizations, nuns, priests, min
isters, and college professors, 
deans, and presidents marching 
in their academic robes.
Whole locals of the AFLCIO walked; professional 
groups; Sioux Indians from 
South Dakota. At the head of 
the line, directly behind the 
speakers, marched veterans of 
other wars, wearing their unifroms and red-white-and-blue 
buttons reading Veterans for 
Peace.
As the crowd waited, at one 
of the field a large circle form
ed around the approximately 100 
young men who had pledged to 
burn their draft cards. They 
stepped forward one - by - one, 
grim faced, lit fire to their cards 
and dropped them into a tin 
can. A few girlfriends and wives 
burnt a part of the cards also. 
There were no arrests made, 
possibly because of the recent 
decision by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals in Boston that the draftcard burning law was uncon
stitutional, but FBI men swarm
ed over the area.
During the waiting, thou
sands of yellow daffodils blos
somed in the lapels of the 
demonstrators, part of the tra
ditional sign of giving flowers 
as a token of peace. Few spec
tators lined the streets as the 
parade passed through desert
ed downtown Manhattan. Oc
casional groups of counter
demonstrators jeered and a 
few tossed eggs, but they were 
hustled away by the police, 
fearful of riots. Most of the 
spectators stood and applauded 
the placard-carriers, as cries 
of peace now, peace now.. 
reverberated between the sky
scrapers.
As the marchers reached the 
UN Plaza, the crowd overflowed 
into the side-streets and many 
never reached the plaza before 
the three and one-half hour pro
gram was over. A folk-singers 
Phil Ochs and Pete Seeger en
tertained the crowd, Dr. Martin 
Luther King presented a peti
tion to UN Secretary Dr. Ralph 
Bunch. The speakers included 
besides Dr. King, Dr. Benjamin 
Spock of SANE; Stokley Car

dent Non-Violent Co-ordinating 
Committee; Floyd McKissisck, 
national Director of CORE; and 
Dr. Linus Pauling, Nobel Prize

In Classical Guitar
Music students may major in 
classical guitar for the first time 
beginning in September at Car
negie Tech.
The four-year course will be 
taught by Irvin Kaufmann, cell
ist and classical guitarist with 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Or
chestra, who will become a sen
ior lecturer at Tech.. He will 
teach part-time.
Maurice I. Laney, assitant 
head of the music department, 
said Tech will offer the instru
ment as a major in response to 
increasing interest by students. 
The guitar is one of the coun
trys most popular instruments, 
but levels of performance and 
instruction are considered low. 
Professor Laney emphasized the 
wide difference between classical 
guitars repertoire dates from 
the l^th tcentury, he said, and 
is more extensive than that of 
the saxophone.
Mr. Kaufmann joined the Pitts
burgh Symphony in 1964. He 
teaches privately, and for one 
year was instructor of classical 
guitar at Mount Mercy College.
Mr. Kaufmann holds several 
awads for performance and 
has played with such major or
chestras as the Ottawa Philhar
monic and the Baltimore Sym
phony Orchestra.
Interested students may make 
applications through the admis
sion office at Carnegie Tech.

Editorials . . .
Impatience vs* Inertia
Its traditional that editorial columnists take a parting 
shot at the world in general, and the new editor of the 
Tartan has kindly given his predecessor this chaTge. One 
of the focal points for students complaints, some of them 
voiced in this column, has been forever will be, the admin
istrations view of the student body. However, students, in 
their quest for the best of all possible worlds, sometimes 
fail to understand some of the inherent administrative 
problems. Students are here for four years, a relatively 
brief time compared to that invested by administrators 
and some of the faculty. This makes long range planning 
difficult, for if one generation of students wants one thing, 
the following generation of students may not want the 
same thing.
On the other hand, if the administration can call stu
dents impatient, the students can accuse the administra
tion of not being completely candid in their opinions and 
statements. Statements such as the Tartan grill will be open 
by October 15 seem to be aimed more at pacifying stu
dents than being realistic.
One of the reasons for the failure of both groups 
to completely understand the other is inherent in the 
fact, often overlooked by students, and many times 
seemingly forgotten by administrators, is that Tech 
is still changing. Despite the things one reads in the 
admissions catalogue, Tech is not necessarily represent
ed by the facade of Baker Hall, old and ivy covered, that 
is supposed to be a symbol of the old established uni
versity. Tech started off as Carnegie Technical schools, 
for all practical purposes, (for Andrew Carnegie was 
a practical man,) a trade school, where one learned 
bricklaying as well as how to parse a sentence. It has 
essentially been in the process of continual change 
since then. The las tvestige of the College of Industries 
disappeared four years ago as the last Printing Man
agement class graduated.
Four years ago, as most seniors will testify, especially 
those in Fine Arts, there was much talk about building a 
new Dramatic Arts Center. In fact, the scale model of the 
campus, sometimes exhibited in Skibo, had a model of it 
placed where the tennis courts are. It has taken Tech four 
years to decide to build the new Center, not because of 
administrative red tape, but because its taken the school 
that long to discover what makes Tech a unique educa
tional institution. The Carnegie University concept is the 
essence of that discovery, where professionalism is em
phasized in all areas of education, from fine Arts and Hu
manities to Engineering and Science.
Undoubtedly, the next four years will have as many 
growing pains as the last four, with as many inherent prob
lems between the administration and the student body. 
Administrators shouldnt be too surprised to see student 
demands for a new Skibo, or a bigger library, or a new 
ca!endar. Students, on the other hand, shouldnt be sur
prised to find the administration more receptive to some 
of these changes especially if pressured by students. It 
might be interesting to see what would happen if the Pres
idents office were deluged with letters demandng that 
Skibo be altered to suit student needs.

Letters to the Editor
Candidate 
Asks Recount
Editor, the Tartan:
As a write-in candidate in the 
previous Student Government 
election, I would like to ask that 
the student body of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology demand 
a recount. The obvious reason 
for this is the ridiculous num
ber of votes that I received.
There are numerous reasons 
why I should have more votes: 
I voted for myself at least 20 
times; I forced the pledges and 
brothers of my fraternity to re
lease their identification cards 
to me so that I could vote with 
them; I had people stuffing the 
ballot box for me (I believe that 
some students found 16 of these 
folded together and lying at the 
bottom of the ballot box); I was 
campaigning at the voting sta
tions and must have influenced 
at least a few people with my 
terrific orations.
From the above cited evidence, 
it seems obvious to be that the 
truly interested students will 
agree with my belief that this 
election seems awfully shady 
and should be investigated or 
possibly held over. I think that 
it is just awful that a candidate 
who abides so closely to the elec
tion rules should be treated in 
such a horrible manner.

Students Must 
Complain To City
Editor, the Tartan:
I feel that it is necessary for 
me to comment on the latest de
velopment in the parking situa
tion. I am chairman of the Gen
eral Campus Committee of Stu
dent Senate. I am also a com
muter and a member of the 
Parking Committee, chaired by 
R. D. Strathmeyer, Vice-president for Business Affairs. The 
issue at hand is the installation 
of the parking meters on Forbes 
Ave. and Schenley Drive on 
April 10.
Before today (April 11), I had 
assurances from the administra
tion at several parking commit
tee meetings that the- sohool was 
engaged in negotiating with the 
city and that no meters would 
be installed until an agreement 
was reached  hopefully that 
these new meters would have 
the same rates as the campus 
meters. Today I found out that 
the school had no knowledge be
forehand that the meters would 
be installed and that they had 
been working in accordance with 
an old agreement that the meter 
installation date would be in
definitely extended until the 
school was pure of its position 
concerning the situation.
The parking committee did 
discuss this problem in all its 
meetings this year, but no solu
tions seemed to be able to be 
proposed because of a high de
gree of conservatism on the
part of the faculty and adminis
tration. A study was made by 
the Physical Plant of parking on 
campus and the suggestion made j 
was that a parking garage be 
built with site, size, and cost 
aiso discussed. Rather than pur
sue this suggestion further, it 
was decided at that meeting that 
the administration would form 
a survey to learn the opinions 
of faculty, staff and students 
concerning various other pro
posals and options for relieving 
the parking problem. This meet- '] 
ing was almost two months ago 
and only today I saw a prelim
inary version of this question
naire and am not able to under
stand what the delay was.
I now suggest that instead of 
leaving the complaining only to 
the administration, that the stu
dents complain in the Tartan, 
in the Pittsburgh Press, and 
Post-Gazette, directly to the city, ^ 
to radio, and television stations, 
etc. If we are vocal enough we 
might be able to have the me
ters removed or changed. It may 
be that the city has the philoso
phy that once the meters are 
installed, it is too late to re
move them. I feel that we should 
have them removed.
I am not placing any blame * 
cn anyone for our problem (ex
cept maybe a bureaucratic and 
money-hungry city administra
tion), but I feel that the cam
pus body is entitled to know 
what is going on.
Philip H. Mason 
Senior, Math
The study supported by the 
U. S. Office of Education reveals 
that members of the group un
doubtedly will be among those 
who do publish and publish of
ten.
What bothers them is the 
expectation of being pres
sured to publish before they 
have something to saypub
lication for its own sake.*
On the plus side, the investi
gators find that these careerrrinded teachers expect satisfac
tion from work, association, 
and friendship with college-age 
students, and the intellectual 
challenge of the academic com
munity.
Opinions from Danforth Fellows
These expectations are report
ed in a sample study of the fac
tors that led nearly 100 college 
seniors to pick college teaching 
as a career. The seniors won 
graduate fellowships in 1965 
from the Danforth Foundation, 
a nonprofit educational group.
The study explored the back
grounds, motives, and char
acteristics of these Danforth 
Fellows. For example, it found 
that the most common reason 
for wanting a college teaching 
career was: I felt that I could 
make the greatest contribu
tion to society in this area.
Understanding the reasons, 
hopes, and personal traits that 
influence a vocational choice of 
this kind, the investigators beieve a vocational choice of this
Study Of Would - Be Profs 
Shows Satisfactions, Fears
A study of a select group of would-be college teachers 
shows that they expect many satisfactions from their chos
en career and one major dissatisfactionthe pressure to
publish. kind, the investigators believe,
can be of great help in identify
ing and encouraging potentially 
good college teachers at a time 
when higher education faces an 
urgent neet for high-caliber fac
ulty.
Other significant findings of 
the study are:
? About a fifth of the Dan
forth Follows wanted to be col
lege teachers before entering 
college, and better than twofifths had made up their minds 
by their junior year. Virtually 
all had chosen this career by 
their senior year.
? As new faculty members,
 the Fellows would like to spend
about 55 per cent of their time 
in teaching activities. Twenty 
years ater they would prefer to 
cut back on teaching and devote 
more time to research and writ
ing. Ideally, they would like to 
give no more than eight per 
cent of their time to administra
tive duties.
? The \tfould-be teachers hope 
to begin their careers at the 
lond of institution where they 
did their undergraduate work, 
usually a private college or uni
versity.
The study was supported by 
the U. S. Office of Education 
through its small contracts re
search program. Funds totaling 
$7,875 were made available un
der the Cooperative Research 
Act.

Spring Delights Promised 
To Tech Carnival Goers
by Rich Steffers
Its springtime in Pittsburgh 
and with the spring comes a 
certain fever, a delightful anti
cipation of the reawakening of 
the Tech campus.
Yes, its time to start thinking 
about Spring Carnival, start 
skimping on lunches to save the 
price of admission, and getting 
a date. Its time to shake loose 
the sooty shaddes of the Pitts
burgh winters and prepare for 
the rites of spring.
What are the rites of spring? 
Ah, ha! All you naive freshman 
with visions of pagan orgies are 
wrong. All these upperclassmen 
who are planning, building, run
ning in circles, pushing strange 
vehicles, and screaming at each 
other arent really mad; theyre 
preparing for this unique phan
tasmagoria known as Spring 
Carnival.
Just looking at the infiinity of 
diverse pleasure in store for you 
as the fortunate Tech student 
who can go to and be a part of 
Spring Carnival 67:
Sweepstakes, Midway, UMOC, 
Sorority Skits  Queen Candi
dates, Concert, Call Day, and 
Spring Carnival Dance.
. . . and . . .
If all you kiddies are real nice 
to your mommies and eat all 
your icky vegetablesthis year 
something newsomething spe
cialCarnegie Techs first 
GYMKHANA
For those of you who are un
initiated in, or forgetful of the 
deep significance and splendor 
of the rites of spring, heres a 
brief resume.
The traditional faculty eggtoss, held Friday afternoon con
sists of two-man teams repre
senting the various academic de
partments on campus. Each team 
is permitted to throw three eggs 
as far as they can, but if the 
egg breaks, the team and the 
half thats supposed to catch it 
losesbig.
Sorority relays, held on the 
front lawn of Hammerschlag 
Hall, will take place on May 5, 
following the faculty egg toss. 
Each of the seven teams parti
cipating in the frollic  some 
events will consist of sorority
women with varied talents rang
ing from crab crawling to 
three legged racing. Except 
for minor alterations, the relays 
will be conducted in the tradi
tional manner.
Unlike past years, in which 
the winning group was selected 
for having the lowest total time, 
this years champions will be 
those who excel in the greatest 
number of races. A first place 
trophy will be given on Satur
day night; second and third 
place runners up will be an
nounced.
Spring Carnival is noted for 
its heated competitions. Perhaps 
the fiercest and dirtiest is the 
Plank Joust Saturday; a con
genial crowd will gather to see 
the teams compete at the local 
mudhole. Two jousters, repre
senting opposing teams, armed 
with stuffed pillow cases, will 
try to knock each other off the 
plank and into the mud.
A serious competition has 
arisen which unfortunately has 
crushed the brain child referred 
to as the Volkswagon Derby. 
Fortunately, a local genius has 
come up with an equally stim
ulating suggestion. If enough en
thusiasm and participants can 
be generated, Carnegie Tech 
will have a Gymkhana. For the 
uniformed a Gymkhana is not a 
Siberian pacifist but a sort of 
parking lot road rally.
All interested participants in 
the games men play, i.e. egg 
toss, plank joust, and the Gymk
hana please get in touch with 
Rich Steffens (681-0347), for fur
ther information.

The Spring Carnival Dance 
this year will encompass the en
tire Student Union with three 
bands playing simultaneously 
throughout the building. The 
main ballroom will be alive to 
the tones and tunes of Richard 
Maltby.
Mr. Maltby, whose musical ca
reer spans two decades, brings 
to the dancers a freshness and 
enthusiasm unduplicated in toRICHARD MALTBY
?days music industry. His per
sonal direction of The Band 
the Dancers Demand will pro
vide an exciting stimulus to the 
closing events of carnival week
end. The band itself, five brass, 
five reeds, and three rhythm, 
consists of topflight musicians 
constantly working together. Mr. 
Maltby directing his group
* amazes listeners as he glides 
from trumpet to flagelhorn to 
vibraphone to chimes to celeste 
or to his fun instrument, the 
kookiephonethe only one of 
its kind.
Mr. Maltbys recent appear
ances include jobs at such 
schools as: Boston College, Col
gate, Cornell, Duke, Northwestf ern, Notre Dame, Princeton, 
Wake Forrest, and Yale. These 
are usually repeat performances. 
If theres one way to judge the 
appeal of a dance band, visit the 
college campus and ask a stu
dent. Where the Malty band has 
played the answer will be one o 
praise for the sound which has 
made some part of their campus

Publicity Chairman
Spring Carnival Comittee
From beginning on a ricketty 
upright piano at the age of sev
en, 33 years later Peter Nero is 
playing a grand everywhere 
from London to Grove City Col
lege. Now Mr. Nero is calling on 
Carnegie Techs Spring Carni
val.
At 8 pm on Friday night, May 
5, Mr. Nero and his trio, consist
ing of piano, bass, and drums, 
will present a concert in his 
unique keyboard style which 
combines elements of jazz and 
popular music along with a de
lightful monologue to form the 
Nero Sound. The Nero style 
has been as much in demand on 
the college campus as it has 
been in New Yorks Philharm
onic Hall. Mr. Neros fall sched
ule included 27 concerts in a 
six-week period, which included 
appearances at eight colleges.
Mr. Neros career really began 
when he entered the famed Juilliard School of Music at the age 
of 14. There he studied piano 
and composition. His early ca
reer had its pitfalls and at one 
time he was so discouraged that 
he took a job selling pianos. 
Later, he returned to piano play
ing and cut his first album 
wfhich was an immediate sellout. 
Besides his initial success in the 
recording industry, Mr. Nero 
has had 15 other albums which 
have been even more successful. 
He has recorded with such fam
ous groups as Arthur Fiedler 
and the Boston Pops. He ar
ranges all his music and applies 
his piano artistry to give his 
arrangements a fresh sound. 
After studying classical styles, 
Peter ran into a wall when con
fronted by jazz and pop.
In searching for the answer 
to the problem, Peter remem
bers, It was when I maturally 
evolved into playing a combina
tion of the three forms that I 
found satisfaction, expression,
PETER NERO
Want to Hold Your Hand. Mr.
Nero has adapted other famous 
jazz numbers such as Gersh
wins Rhapsody in Blue.
Mr. Nero has received many 
awards which include two Gran
ny awards from the Nation
al Association of Recording Arts 
and Sciences. His fame is not 
limited to this country. He has 
appeared in England and Hol
land and had requests from Ja
pan, Brazil, Australia, Thailand, 
Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, 
and Scandinavia. He has appear
ed on top television shows, in
cluding the Ed Sullivan Show, 
Tonight Show, Perry Como 
Show, the Bob Newhart Show. 
The evening promises to be most 
enjoyable and rewarding.
and a measure of distinction in 
what I was doing. If I found 
that a pop or jazz tune had a 
passage reflecting the pattern 
of something classical, I played 
a touch of itto show the sim
ilarity and to give it an extra 
artistic dimension. After the first 
record, people kept telling me I 
was blending classics and jazz. 
It wasnt a conscious effort. The 
style is just me and all the 
things Id been playing for years. 
I was fortunate in being able to 
blend all the elements.
Among his many recordings, 
one will find such favorite as 
Hello Dolly and the Beatles I

Masks Beneath the Surface .. .
INGMAR BERGMAN'S
Persona
by Stan Thomas
It has been two and a half years since Bergmans last film. In 
the interim the Swedish director has been staging plays, among them 
Pirandellos Six Characters In Search of an Author. The influence 
of this play on Bergmans latest film is evident not only in theme but 
in style and treatment.
The central action of the film is a study of transferal of identity 
or as Bergman defines identity, responsibility for being who and what 
we are. This study exists within a parenthetical cine-psychological 
montage of images that seem to trace the philosophical arguments of 
past Bergman cinemysticism. Images of death, martyrdom, and a 
glimpse of the Bergman Spider God which we did or did not see in 
Through A Glass Darkly hold our attention to the screen. The final 
image of this prologue is of a boythe boy from The Silence examin
ing the faces of the two actresses who are about to play roles in the 
film about to begin. Bergman insists on confronting the audience with 
the fact that they are watching a filmeven by showing a camera 
panning a sequence, including a moment when the film itself breaks 
and burns out in the projector. The screen goes white; voices are 
heard and when the film returns, it is out of focus.
The central action of the film concerns an actress, Elizabeth Vogler, who stops during a performance of Electra and refuses to accept 
her identityher responsibility. The other woman is Alma, the nurse 
assigned to Elizabeth who is in a hospital at the beginning of the film. 
A doctor suggests the actress and the nurse spend a few weeks at a 
summer cottage. The two women have astoundingly similiar faces 
which first prompts the nurse to comment on their resemblance. 
Slowly Alma takes on the identity of Elizabeth until finally she has 
re-cast Elizabeth in her own image. The opposite, however, could also 
be true: Elizabeth has recreated Alma in her own image until Alma 
can play her role. Perhaps it is both.
The two actresses who portray the womenBiBi Anderson and 
Liv Ullmannare breathtakingly brilliant. Miss Anderson as the 
mute actress has only one line in the entire film which means Miss 
Ullmann carries all the dialogue. She does it with such finesse that 
the foreign Swedish language intrigued my ear to such a degree that 
I found myself not reading the sub-titles. There are only four speak
ing parts in the entire film and twothe doctor and Elizabeths hushandhave only a few minutes devoted to them.
Persona seems to be a summation of what Bergman was trying to 
say in his God and Man trilogy (Through A Glass Darkly, Winter 
Light, The Silence). The Silence which was the synthesis of the trilogy, 
is the thesis that precedes Persona. Bergman, however, never con
vinced me throughout the first two films of the trilogy that he had 
anything profound or interesting to say about God and Man. Only in 
The Silence was the statement vital and supplemented by a brilliant 
cinematic style.
Persona seems a further development of this style. Bergman is 
on proper ground when he is concerned with the theatrehis best 
films have been concerned in some way with theatre. (In The Magi
cian exists all the raw material for 8 Vi. Fellini is a Bergman fan 
and vice-versa.) This translation of Pirandellian theatre to film creates 
an excitementand a finesse that lay dormant in Bergman for too 
long. There is one scene in which Elizabeth watches a Buddhist monk 
bum himself while a crowd riots around him. Although the sequence 
is being shown on a television news report, the crowds seem to be 
outside of her door; she seems to be in some danger. This bit of cine
matic brilliance is counterbalanced with a bit of cinematic ascetic
ism in which the camera focusses on the face of first Elizabeth and 
then Alma as Alma relates the same story twice.
Persona is opening today at the Forum on Forbes Avenue in 
Squirrel Hill. I recommend it to anyone who is tired of discussing 
the meaning of Blow-Up and is looking for a new bit of cinematic 
excitement.

"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in The Closet And I'm Feeling So Sad," 
the new Paramount Pictures release opening soon at the Shad/side Theater wraps up the bizarre in a film that defies the laws of comic gravity.
Rosalind Russel, an extravagantly wealthy widow, who is abnormally pos
sessive about her son, played by Robert. Morse, travels around the globe carry
ing with her an ornate casket containing her preserved dead husband, played by 
Jonathan Winters. The humor strikes rapid-fire and unexpectedly in a zany, 
incongruous world, where the human confusion is sensitively examined, yet 
treated with a narvelously irreverent and satiric touch.
Also featured in the cast are Barbara Harris and Hugh Griffith, who help 
make this Seven Arts-Ray Stark production a madcap adventure into comedy.
The picture shown here is indicative of what goes on in this zany movie. 
Can you capfion if? If you come up with the best caption for this still photograph 
from the movie, you will win the RCA film soundtract album as well as two 
passes to the Shadyside Theater to see "Oh Dad, Poor Clad, Mamma's Hyng You

The Foul Line
by LARRY SIKON 
Tartan Sports Editor
Recently, a varsity bowling team was formed without the support 
of the school and compiled an outstanding record in local varsity 
competition. Despite their record and the obvious interest shown, the 
school is still not willing to pay the small fee necessary to finance a 
varsity bowling team.
It is my opinion and always has been, that Carnegie Tech should 
try its best to sport a varsity team in all intercollegiate sports. In 
particular, I would like to see the formation of varsity baseball, soc
cer, and bowling teams. While I am aware that the first two would 
require funds and facilities that are not presently available, I feel 
that there is no excuse for our not having a varsity bowling team.
The cost of such a team would certainly not represent a great 
portion of the athletic budget, and the student interest in this sport, 
as well as the other two, has been clearly demonstrated by the large 
number of participants in intramurals dealing with these sports.
Varsity sports should always be the most emphasized area of 
interest. My dealings with varsity sports have shown me that there 
is a great value to both the student and the school that is to be 
gotten out of participating in intercollegiate sports, regardless of the 
scale of that sport. The addition of further varsity sports opens the 
door of participation to a large number of students who might other
wise be unable to take part in varsity competition. I feel that Carnegie 
can only gain by adding such sports as bowling to its agenda and 
should do so as quickly as possible.
Before finishing what may be the last Foul Line, I would like to 
thank all of my staff for a job well done. In particular, I would like 
to thank Jim Lipman, Ron Finnin, and Jim Janke for the large 
amounts of time they spent in order to make the coverage what it was.

Page 8-CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN-Wednesday, April 19, 1967Track Team Splits Pair
by Ron Finnin
The Carnegie Tech track team won one and lost one last week as they first dropped 
a hard-fought meet at Westminster on Wednesday and then came back to beat Geneva in 
an away meet Saturday.
By far the better of the two 
meets was that held at West
minster. Even though the Tar
tans lost 8V2-62V2, the individ
ual events were much closer and 
competition was really stiff as 
Tech tried to rise to beat West
minster. The team showed great 
spirit and as a result the times 
were faster, the distances longer 
than at the Geneva meet. The 
second meet was really easier 
for the Tartans to win than the 
score shows as Tech took 11 
firsts in 15 events, and in the 
majority of cases, partially due 
to conditions of the track and 
lack of serious competition, the 
performances were far from 
their best of the year.
The Tartans made a good 
showing at Westminster but lost
the meet because they were able 
to take only seven firsts in 17 
events and did not take a large 
enough majority of seconds and 
thirds to offset this unbalance. 
Westminster swept the broad 
jump and the javelin, but other
wise neither team showed com
plete domination in any area of 
the competition.
At Geneva the story was just 
the opposite as Tech took over 
in firsts but was really behind 
in seconds and thirds. Saturday 
was also the first meet this year 
where Tech has come out ahead 
in the field, as the score from 
the seven field events was Tech 
35, Geneva 28.
The big standout was again 
Bemie Flynn as in the two 
meets he took six first places 
to continue a long string of vic
tories for Tech in distance run
ning.
This Saturday, April 22, Tech 
is playing host to St. Francis 
and Waynesburg for the only 
triangle meet of the season. 
Meet time is 1:30 pm.

Tartan Golf Team 
Beats Bethany, Geneva
by George Smith 
One again as spring rolls around the Carnegie Tech golf 
team has taken to the greens of Longue Vue Country Club. 
Golf coach, William Rogers, was just a little disappointed 
at this years turnout. The team lost two of its best players 
last year and only one freshman tried out for the team this 
year.
As it stands right now, the 
team consists of eight players: 
John Mulholland, Bob Blasier, 
and Bill Bruggler, all seniors; 
Randy Borden, a sub-senior; 
Bill Hobel, a junior; George 
Smith and Lee Smithyman, 
sophomores; and John Oroukin, 
the sole freshman.
Tech Tennis Team
Stays Undefeated
by Michael Smolens
After two early victories over 
Duquesne and St. Vincent, the 
Carnegie Tech netters faced 
their first taste of stiff competion when the previously unde
feated Grove City Grovers fell 
victims to the Tartans, 8-1, on 
the Tech courts. Playing nearly 
flawless tennis, Salim Khan (T) 
outclassed Dan McKelvey (GC),
6-0, 6-2. At the second singles, 
Bob Lowe (T) outhit Chick 
Schmidt CGC), 63-4, 9-7. Dick 
Londergan (T) was upset by 
Bill Vorlagen (GC), 6-3, 6-3. Mike 
Smolens (T) came from far be
hind to outlast Bill McMillan 
(GC), 1-6, 6-1, 7-5.
Conditioning also proved a fac
tor in the last two singles match
es, both of which went to three 
sets with Joe Gordon (T) subdueing Jum Crabtree (GC), 2-6,
7-5, 6-3, and Sam Hicken (T) 
hanging for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 victory 
over Burt McMillan (GC). The 
doubles competition proved quite 
a bit easier for the Tartans as 
all three matches were won in 
straight sets. Khan and Gordon 
(T) crushed Vorlagen and Mc
Kelvey (GC), 6-1, 6-1; Lowe and 
Smolens (T) defeated Bill Mc
Millan and Schmidt (GC), 6-3, 
6-3; and Londergan and Leigh 
DeHuff (T) won over Burt Mc
Millan and Hermann (GC), 6-3 
6-3.
Last Saturday, the netters trav
eled to Waynesburg to face the 
defending West Penn Champs, 
and the Tartans scored their 
second whitewash of the young 
season, 9-0. The highlight of the 
match, played before a highly 
partisan home crowd, was the 
first doubles match between 
Khan and Gordon (T) and Dick 
Strukel and Gardner Field (W), 
which was won by Tech in the 
longest, hardest fought duel of 
the year, 10-8, 5-7, 9-7. Waynes
burg, down 5-1 in the second 
set, fought off nine match points 
to win the second set, and then 
Tech had to fight off five match 
points in the third set to win 
the match.
In the singles competition, it 
was Khan (T) over Strukel (W), 
6-3, 6-3; Lowe (T) over Field 
(W), 6-3, 6-2; Londergan (T) 
over Don Lister (W), 6-2, -0;
Smolens (T) over Girardin (W), 
6-3, 6-0; Gordon (T) over Gary 
Shannon (W), 6-0, 6-3; Hicken 
(T) over Lee Boser, 6-2, 6-2. In 
the doubles, it was Khan and 
Gordon winning, 10-8, 5-7, 9-7; 
Londergan and DeHuff (T) over

Friday, the big match of the 
year will take place on the Tech 
courts at 2:30 against Bethany. 
Last season, Bethany defeated 
Tech, 7-2, with Khan losing for 
the second year in a row to 
Bethanys number one man Kirk

other lettermen, will be back 
trying to once again defeat the 
Tartans. On Saturday, the net
ters will travel to Washington, 
Pa., to face the W&J Presidents, 
and hopefully will record their 
sixth victory without any losses.

don leads the team with a rec
ord of 8-0; next are Kahn, Lowe, 
and Smolens with 7-0; then 
comes Hicken, 5-0; Wright, 3-0; 
Beissinger, 1-0; Londergan, 5-2; 
DeHuff, 2-1; and Gilbert, 1-1.
Throughout the spring you 
will probably see various types 
of scoring used in the golf 
meets. It is the home teams pre
rogative to decide how the scor
ing is to be done. Coach Rogers 
likes to use a ten-point system. 
He uses six men playing in 
three twosomes, each man com
peting individually against a  
member of the other team, and 
each twosome has a chance for 
a point by beating the best ball 
0/ the opposing twosome. The 
tenth point is given to the man 
who has the low medal score.
Thus far the team has played 
three matches, all home meets.
In the first meet, Carnegie de
feated Bethany IVi to 8V8. John 
Mulholland, Bill Bruggler, Bob ^ 
Blasier, and John Oroukin win
ning their individual matches, 
Mulholland and Borden winning 
their team match, Blasier and 
Bruggler winning their team 
match, and Hobel and Oroukin 
halfing their team match. John 
Mulholland was medalist with 
78.
In their second match the 
teaim was defeated by St. Vin
cent IV8 to 8V8. The only points 
for Tech coming from George 
Smith and Bill Habel. Smith 
won his match and Habel tied 
his. They also won their best 
ball match for the other point.
In their third match last Fri
day, the team defeated Geneva,
7 to 3. John Mulholland and 
Randy Borden as a team took ^ 
all three of their points, Bill 
Habel and John Oroukin took 
all three of their points also. 
The seventh point was earned 
by John Mulholland who again 
took medalist with a 77.
