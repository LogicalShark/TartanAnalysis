DGs And Betas Win 
Firsts in Scholarship
9 DU and DDDTake Seconds
The statistics on fraternity, sorority, and all-school facfor the 1959-60 fall semester reveal that'all averages with th 
exception of all-sorority and all-men were higher than the 
same averages last spring. All sorority is lower by 0.15 and 
all men by 0.07.
Delta Gamma and Beta Theta Pi both repeated their pre
vious firsts of last semester in the scholarship race. Delta 
tpamma scored an average of 2.93 marking their third 
consecutive win. Beta Theta Pi took first place with an aver
age of 2.46 placing them well above the rest of the fraternity 
system. The Council of Fraternity Presidents and the Panhellenic scholarship trophies will be awarded at Greek 
Swing, March 5.

Coach Eyes Goal 
Of 15 Victories
IAt the start of this 1959-60 basketball campaign, coach 
Mel Cratsley predicted that with a good season and some 
breaks, Tech could accumulate 15 victories.
Well, now that the Tartans already have 13 wins with 
still three games left to play (tw64- ~
of those contests are against 
Waynesberg and W&J which are 
easy pushovers), Cratsleys mark 
of 15 triumphs seems within easy 
^each. The only other game left on 
the schedule is a meeting with 
Pitt, at Skibo Gym this Tuesday 
evening. A Tartan upset over the 
Panthers could give the Skibos a
16-8 record and a truly memor
able season for the team.
Tech Downs Rockets
A week ago Tuesday the men 
from Tartansville met and cut 
down the high flying Rockets from 
j^slippery Rock. The Slippery Rock 
streak of 10 consecutive wins and 
two men toting 20-point averages.
The Plaids bounced off to a 5-0 
lead in the first two minutes but 
this diminished as quickly as it 
squad came to Skibo Gym with a 
started. Two Rocket hoops put the 
score at 5-4, and from that point 
until the closing minutes of the 
half neither team held more than 
a four-point lead. With just two
minutes left in the half, Frazier 
and Flynn put on a superb shoot
ing exhibition and between them 
they tallied the last 16 points of 
the half including 8 straight in the 
closing minutes. They boosted the 
(41-37) edge to (49-37) before the 
half-time buzzer sounded.
Tech Holds Lead
In the second half the Tartan 
five were able to hold off several 
Rocket attacks and hold on to 
their lead. Twice the Rockets 
came within 3 points of overtak
ing Tech, but, thanks to the clutch 
shooting by Andy Komer, Tech 
was able to maintain the margin. 
With three of Slippery Rocks 
men gone via personal CARNEGI Tech 
was able to rack up seventeen 
points against Slippery Rocks six 
in the closing minutes and finally 
subdue the Rockets (77-63).
A noteworthy point was the rec
ord set by Bill Soffa of most ca
reer points by a Tartan player.

Conference 
Closing Out
On Tuesday, February 16, 
Techs Religious Conference began 
with an assembly at GSIA audi
torium. Gus Tyler, president of the 
International Ladies Garment 
Workers Union, spoke on Ethics 
vs. the Materialistic Drive. After 
the lecture, a panel discussion was 
held.
, Throughout this week and last, 
discussion groups in the various 
fraternity houses investigated the 
problem further, led by faculty 
members who consented to give 
their services. The conference was 
arranged by the Committee on 
Religious Affairs, whose members 
are the clergy representing the 
religious denominations on cam
pus.
Womens Housing 
Undergoes Change
The turnover of residents in 
Morewood Gardens seems to be 
almost as rapid as in a hotel. In 
fact, housing arrangements have 
changed so much this semester 
that a fellow doesnt know 
whether to call his girl in Mellon. 
Laurel, or Morewood.
Mrs. Green, the head of wom
ens housing, has a phenomenal 
memory for numbers. She stated 
that there were 445 girls in More
wood at the beginning of first se
mester. Morewroods capacity is 
438, so seven double rooms were 
temporarily made into triples to 
take care of the seven extra girls. 
Mellon Hall opened with thirtytwo girls, seven of whom lived in 
one large dormitory room down
stairs which was affectionately 
called the zoo by its inmates.
Complicated Morewood
By second semester, however, 
twenty-four girls had left More
wood and eleven new dormitory 
residents had moved in. Eleven 
girls were also moved over to 
Morewood from Mellon Hall, and 
one girl from each of two small 
triples was moved into a double 
room. These changes brought the 
number of Morewood residents up

Group of INSTEP Engineers
The fourth group of Indian trainees in the Indian Steel 
Training and Educational Program (IN STEP) will arrive 
in the United States this week according to an announce
ment made today by Carnegie Tech, the central adminis
trative agency for the Program. ?-------------------
The ninety-seven trainees were 
originally scheduled to begin their 
program in September of last
year, but due to conditions in the 
steel industry, their arrival was 
postponed.
IN STEP w'as started in 1957 
under a grant from the Ford 
Foundation and recently extended 
for a three year period. Under the 
terms of the extension the Inter
national Cooperation Administra
tion Administration, which was 
not previously involved in the 
program, will pay most of the 
trainee maintenance costs while 
the Ford Foundation w'ill continue
costs of international transporta
tion and costs of in-plant train
ing are absorbed by the steel in
dustry.
The new trainees will arrive in 
the United States this week and 
will go to Washington, D.C. for an 
orientation program on the United 
States conducted by the Washing
ton International Center of the 
American Council oh Education. 
Following the orientation, the 
trainees will come to Tech for a 
two-day orientation to the IN 
STEP Program, including an in
troduction to the steel industry 
and the United States Steel Work
ers of America. Upon completion 
of this orientation, the trainees
to pay the cost of administration j will report to the participating

ROVING REPORTER
Recollections
Now that the fall semester has passed, the EL53L 
roving reporter asked several Tech students to think back 
over the semester and pick out evidence for or against the 
idea that this semester has been marked by apathy. Opinion 
seems to be divided in the ques-^----------------------
tion of interest in school activi
ties. The concenus is, however, 
that no one is apathetic toward 
studies and classes.
Peggy Ford, junior P&D: 'This 
has been one of the most apa
thetic semesters I have ever seen 
here at Tech. Our football team 
had one of its best seasons. How 
many went to any of the games 
except the last one? This huge ado 
about Spring Carnival fell flat on 
its face when no one had the 
courage or thoughtfulness or real 
interest to do any real investiga
tion into the matter. When no 
improvements came to mind, the 
subject was dropped. With new 
buildings up on campusthe Hunt 
Library and Union now under 
constructionhow many - students 
have bothered to look at the plans 
and blueprints? The buildings are 
to be used by the students. The 
planners are interested in showing 
the plans to anyone and would be 
glad to talk over an^ suggestions 
or improvements you might have. 
It will be too late to complain 
about the building after it is com
pleted. Actually, this semester is' 
no more marked by apathy than 
in other years. But I see no de
cline in this apathy among Tech 
students.
VOLUM E53UMMN LBR1BWB5

YTU9 5M,YM55S It would seem that, 
although Carnegie is the type of 
school that it is, with such a strong 
emphasis on studies, there has 
been less apathy evident this se
mester than at any time since the 
beginning of my freshman year. 
This has been evidenced by the 
support given our athletic teams. 
Although not overwhelming, it has 
been considerably more than in 
the past. A prime example of this 
woiV be the reception given our 
basketball team after their over
time victory over Grove City. 
Students met the team outside the 
gym at 2:00 a.m. to welcome them 
back. This is unheard of in the 
annals of Carnegie Tech history. 
This, indeed, is a step in the right 
directionmore interest in school 
activi' '-'3.
.UMTh dY5tB0N L5MYB EU,,Y5 
EOR1S I think that apathy has 
been shown on this campus to the 
least extent of any time during the 
past 3^ years. The students 
seemed at least somewhat inter
ested in campus affairs and the 
audience at basketball games has 
finally begun to show some anima
tion.
fBoah b5YM5aN LBR1BWB5 7BW5 
Ec WUeBS Weve always had
apathy as far as football and other 
sports go, even this year when we 
had a winning team. There could 
have been more support shown at 
games. Half the time you dont
Exchange Program
There has been some talk re
cently of an exchange program 
with other Pittsburgh schools 
wherein students of one school 
could take courses at the others 
and receive credit towards grad
uation for them. The EL53LNB 
roving reporter asked several 
Tech students to express an opin
ion on the value and advisability 
of such a program.
GUO9 vO,OMthN eOMYB 4YAY9 5Mp
,YM55S I feel that Tech offers 
enough courses of high enough 
quality to rank among the top 
schools in the country. I dont 
think that any other school in this 
area could offer any courses which 
would benefit me more than those 
here at Tech.
rYaah 4O5N 05L1WUMN ,5M5U9 
LDOtY5LS I think such U program 
would provide' excellent oppor
tunities to make use of the educa
tional facilities at Pitt and Duquesne. It would add a lot to my 
four years in college.
49UY5 vBsMN 6OMYBN G UMt dS 
I would consider such a pro
gram valuable because it would 
enable me to get the point of viewr 
of other schools. It would be in
tellectually broadening.
GB99h v5PUN 05L1WUM WUD1 WUp
eBS I would approve of an ex
change program because some of 
the departments in other schools 
have more extensive courses. A 
program like this would allow 
more emphasis to be put on each 
subject in the schools.
6B1M E59YM,UY9YLN R1hLYTL L5MYBS 
As far as I am concerned, I have 
a large enough selection oi courses

THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY SIGAFOOS
It was a dullish evening at the Theta house. The pledges were 
down in the catacombs; the actives were sacked out upstairs, 
not doing much of anything. Mary Ellen Iyrumbald was stick
ing pins in an effigy of the housemother; Evelyn Zinsmaster 
was welding a manhole cover to her charm bracelet; Algelica 
^McKeesport was writing a letter to Fabian in blood. Tike I say, 
it was a dullish evening.
Suddenly Dolores Yladnay stood up and stamped her foot. 
Chaps, she said to her sorors, this is too yawn-making! Lets 
do something gay and mad and gasp-making. Anybody got an
idea?............
No, said the sorors, shaking their little sausage curls. 
Think, chaps, think! said Dolores and passed Marlboro 
cigarettes to everybody, for if there ever was a smoke to start 
you thinking, it is mild and flavorful Marlboro! Things come 
clear when you puff that good, clean smoke through that fine 
filterknot untie,* dilemmas dissolve, problems evaporate, 
cobwebs vanish, fog disperses, an*! the benevolent sun pours 
radiance on a new and dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh, 
Marlboro! Oh, soft pack! Oh, flip-top box! Oh, get some 
already!
Now Geraldine Quidnunc, her drooping brain cells revivified 
by a good Marlboro, leapt up and cried, Oh, I have a perfect 
gasser of an idea! Lets hypnotize somebody!
Oh, capital! cried the sorors. Oh, tingle-making!
At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alice Bluegown. Excuse me, mistresses, said she, tugging her forelock, 
I have finished making your beds, doing your homework, and 
ironing your pleats. Will there be anything else?
yes, snapped Dolores Vladnay. When I count to three, 
you will be hypnotized.
Yes, excellency, said Alice, bobbing a curtsey.
One, two, three, said Dolores.
Alice promptly went into a trance.
Go back, said Dolores, back into your childhood. Go 
back to your fifth birthday, back to your birth, to before your 
birth, to your last incarnation ... Now, who are you?
My name is Bridey Sigafoos, said Alice. The year is 1818, 
and I am in County Cork.
Coo! said the sorors.
How old are you? asked Dolores.
I am seven, said Alice.
Where is your mother? asked Dolores.
I dont know, said Alice. She got sold at the .fair last 
year.
Coo! said the sorors.
Tell us about yourself, said Dolores.
I am five feet tall, said Alice. I have'brown eyes, and 1 
weigh 3200 pounds.
Coo! said the sorors.
Isnt that rather heavy for a girl? said Dolores.
Whos a girl? said Alice. Im a black and white guernsey.** 
Coo! said the sorors. 
f'Moo! said Bridey Sigafoos.

CURTAIN GOING UP!
is cMD5UM vn 'OMoS1
Jacc kieThu
As touching and profound a portrait of childhood as has 
ever been put on the screen is to be found in a new film from 
France, The 400 Blows.
An adolescent boy in Paris today, feeling unwanted and 
neglected by his mother and foster father, is having a dif
ficult time adjusting to life. He is lax in his school work, 
plays truant frequently, and runs away from home. He then 
steals a typewriter from his fathers office and attempts un
successfully to pawn it. The parents use the theft as an ex
cuse to send the boy to a correctional school for juvenile de
linquents, and at the end he has escaped from that place, 
too, and is temporarily on his own again.
Rather than simply tell a story, the director Francios 
Trufaut, was concerned with capturing on film the moods 
and feelings of the child of our time. These are universal 
emotions, regardless of external circumstance, and he has 
achieved his intentions magnificently, thanks to his own 
sensitive handling of the material and also to the stirring 
performance in the leading role he has drawn from JeanPierre Leaud.
It is hard to imagine any spectator so callous as to be un
moved by this youngster or fail to respond to everything he 
feels and does  whether it is the humorous baiting of a 
tyrannical teacher in the classroom or the hurt look when 
he is slapped in the face for reaching for his food too soon 
in the reform school. (He reminds us here of Oliver Twist 
asking for more.)
And the sequence in which the boy is questioned in 
clinical detail by a psychiatrist about why he lies, his feel
ings toward his parents and other personal things, is the most 
poignant and powerful of all. Trufaut directs this long scene 
with the camera on the face of the child the entire time (the 
interrogator is never shown) and young Laud packs more 
revelation of character into these three minutes than most 
adult actors do in an entire film.

The Challenge .
Why is it so hard to climb a mountain? Its a high moun-' 
tain. Are you afraid that you might fall? Are you afraid 
that you might become too tired if you exert yourself? Are 
you afraid that you might fail, that the summit is not within
your reach? Do you fear the loss^----------r-------------
of dignity if you do not reach very well. The space between the
?
your goal? Sometimes all of these 
factors affect those who climb, 
and in a way they are natural 
fears. But these do not form the 
highest barrier to climbing a 
mountain. The barrier lies within 
man himself. The barrier that 
keeps you from.beginning; the in
ability to begin the long climb up
ward.
The difficulty to begin: tho^e 
who write will understand this
paper and the pen is a great dis
tance to cross. But ambition is 
stimulated by the desire to com
municate your ideas, your 
thoughts, your experiences. You 
have something to say, and the 
challenge to say it well, to be 
understood and appreciated is a 
challenge that can and should be 
met by you.
We present you with tne chal
lenge now. Write. Give your ideas
life on paper. Share your experi
ences with your contemporaries. 
Challenge them with your person
al thoughts. It is only you who can,^ 
fill the pages of the EL53Lh the 
Technical, the Scot with interest
ing and thought-provoking ma
terial. It is only you who can put 
creative ideas into the Thistle, 
Patterns, and WRCT. And as you 
meet this challenge you climb up
ward, growing through your en
deavor, You are rewarded with 
self respect and the respect of oth
ers. It is not so hard to climb a, 
mountain if you begin to climb 
now. Right now. Write now.
Basketball
Editor, the EL53Lg
At the recent Tech-Pitt basket
ball game at the Field House, a 
group of Tech students arrived 
during the second half and were 
required to pay the full admis
sion price of $1.25. Not being able 
to afford this amount to see the 
final ten minutes of the game, the 
students had to leave. In view of 
the frequent criticisms of apathy 
toward local college athletics* it 
would seem that a less harsh pol
icy for student fans would be de
sirable. The policy at Tech is to 
admit fans arriving after half; time free. Is the University of 
Pittsburgh so commercial that 
they could not be more lenient to 
students?
An even better policy for col
lege athletic events wrould be to 
admit students from the visiting 
school as well as from the home 
school without charge. Certainly 
if athletics are worthwhile, stu
dent support should be encourag
ed.

Loyalty OathG;
Editor, the EL53Lg
In reference to your article of 
February' 10th A Sad State of 
Affairs. your examinations of ob
jections to the loyalty oath fall 
far short of an intelligent analysis 
of its implications. We might dis
cuss the legitimacy of outlawing, a 
political party in the United 
States, we might also consider 
whether or not our constituion 
gives the right for forceful over
throw of the government; how
ever, even if we accept federal 
laws concerning Communist party 
membership, the necessity to reg
ister these beliefs, it would still 
be hard to sanction the loyalty 
oath. We live in a society where 
a man is innocent until he is prov
en guilty (or don't we?), yet you 
would have students first purge 
themselves of evil ideas by swear
ing their loyalty to an institution 
we call our government. In your 
article you have already assumed 
that any person who would not 
sign this loyalty oath had some
thing to hide.
Your examination of complaints 
centered mainly about govern
ment interference in student af
fairs. You seemed to have brush
ed this aside. It would seem to
! me that democracy is based BM 
' the assumption that an intelligent 
| public can choose for itself 1Bs 
it shall be governed. Certainly BO 
democracy was conceived on this 
principle and certainly our con
stitution made it possible for gov
ernment change. This change can 
only be brought about peacefully 
by an enlightened public. If this 
enlightened public is to be a prod
uct of our educational system, BO 
educational system must be free 
of government censure. If we are 
to assume that a political party 
in power were to dictate what was 
desirable in theory or practice 0B 
our college students to think, then 
we have come to accepting the 
Communist and the Fascist idea B0 
a state molding its individuals to 
serve in that states absolute au-nn 
thority.
Of course your reaction to thesestrong criticisms of the loyalty 
oath are written off in your ar
ticle under the title idealists* 
\yho you claim are making much 
ado about nothing.
However, we need only point to 
the recent McCarthy programs in 
which many innocent people be
came the victims of wanton ac mAD31SM- D OLUM 5] 3sf

How to shrink a giant computer
Electronic computers do big jobs 250,000,000 calculations a day, for 
instance, in tracking earth satellites.
She computers already gargantuan capacity is being increased at mBM 
as our scientists and engineers probe deep into the mysteries of such 
fields as cryogenics, magnetics and microwaves. Ltilizing many of their 
findings, we are simultaneously working to shrink the giant computers 
of today down to Som Shumb size.
She improvement qf our products and methods is an area to which 
mBM has devoted a great deal of time and work. Shis effort has resulted 
in a steady, planned growth, which in turn has created excellent career 
opportunities for persons of widely diverse skills and talents in research,

Bowling MVP: Southpaw Dave Harvey, SAE Junior
Dave Harvey 
Once Again 
Bowlin MVPo
The end of th bowling league 
play put an end to the struggle 
for the bowler with the highest 
average in the school. The final 
calculations showed that Dave 
Harvey was the Most Valuable 
Player for the second consecutive 
year. His average was eight pins 
per game better than the runnerup for this honor, Ed MacEwen.
Dave was captain and top bowl
er on the SAE team this year. 
His average of 184 is a new school 
record.
Last year he was Tech's repre
sentative in the St. Louis Inter
collegiate bowling champions. He 
led Techs bowling team to the 
Eastern Regionals championship 
last year. All in all, Dave wound 
up as one of the top twenty col
legiate bowlers in the country last 
year. As of this week, it looks 
as though he will duplicate his 
performances this year.
Dave has also won many tour
naments in his home town of j Akron. Being oniy a junior, he 
I will be back next year trying to 
I break his own record.
Tech Swimmers Surface
On Feb. 12 and 13, a largely 
improved team showed surprising 
strength. Kent State went under 
47-46, while Fenn went down 48- 
46. Much credit is due to Coach 
Sofield who saved his strongest 
men for the critical events.
Several school records fell by 
the wayside on this road trip. 
Dick Line bettered his own school 
record in the individual medley 
with a time of 2:30.9. The medley 
relay team of Fred Schirm, Dick 
Line, Steve Strasen, and Steve 
Ernst had a record time of 4:24.6. 
Steve Ernst, also came through in 
the 200 yard backstroke with a 
2:28.8 for a new record.
Steve Strasen, 200 yard breaststroker, gave the team the added 
strength it needed .taking two 
critical second places as he came 
into his own at the Ohio meets.
The season record now stands 
at four wins and five losses, three 
of the last four meets being vic
tories, leaving * two remaining 
meets before the Penn-Ohio 
Championships on March 5.

Hawks, and an easy 70-30 win 
over the Clyde Street Boys. It was

this, he often carries $25,000 worth of equipment with him.
Here, Dick checks line-of-sight with a distant repeater station by 
mirror-flashing and confirms reception by portable radio. Using this 
technique, reflections of the suns rays can be seen as "far as 50 miles.

For engineer Richard A. Ernsdorff, the uniform of the 
day changes frequently. A Monday might find him in a 
checkered wool shirt on a Washington or Idaho mountain 
top. Wednesday could be a collar-and-tie day.
Dick is a transmission engineer with the Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph Company in Seattle, Washington. He 
joined the company in June, 1956, after getting his B.S.E.E. 
degree from Washington State University. I wanted to 
work in Washington, he says, with an established, grow
ing company where I could find a variety of engineering op
portunities and could use some imagination in my work.
Dick spent 21/2 years in rotational, on-the-job training, 
doing power and equipment engineering and learning the 
business. Since April, 1959, he has worked with micro
wave radio relay systems in the Washington-Idaho area.

JAMES KEATING
Vltlanova University '59
Not at all sure of the area
of engineering (develop
ment, design, test, manu
facturing) which would 
interest him most, Jim has 
been most impressed by 
the way Kearfott Project 
Engineers STAY WITH A 
PROJECT from study phase 
right through to produc
tion, assuming full tech
nical and financial respon
sibility for the quality and 
salability (price-wise) of 
the finished hardware. He 
finds that this Kearfott 
philosophy enables him to 
operate across the broad 
spectrum of engineer
ing.*** Coming from outof-town, Jim was also 
pleasantly surprised by the 
wide choice of living quar
ters readily available.
The very advanced nature 
of many Kearfott projects 
fired this engineers 
imagination. He joined the 
Electronics Systems Lab, 
where he worked on the 
development of a tiny 
counter-part of what is 
believed to be the most 
accurate test equipment 
yet devised for missile 
guidance systems. After 
exposure to the diversity 
of the projects in the Sys
tems Lab, Stan has decided 
to look no further, but re
quested permanent assign
ment here, where work 
ranges over space naviga
tion, digital computers, 
guidance systems, solid 
state physics, industrial 
automation systems and 
diverse electronic systems.

Len is pleased with his six 
months experience at 
Kearfott on two widely dif
ferent counts. First is the 
combination of both theo
retical and practical know
how he has gained In a 
field that has fascinated 
him for a long time-tran
sistor applications. The 
other is Kearfotts loca
tion. Finding midtown New 
York only 40 minutes away 
by car, Len, a veteran, is 
planning to continue his 
studies for an MS at one 
of the many colleges in the 
New York/New Jersey area: 
Columbia, N.Y.U., Stevens, 
Newark College of Engi
neering are all close by. 
This semester, Len has 
enrolled for two Kearfott 
sponsored courses taught 
at the plant.
Newark College 
of Engineering 59
Gary has worked by choice 
in two Laboratories since 
he joined Kearfott last 
June-Astronautics and 
Electronics. He values the 
opportunity he had to work 
In direct contact with 
senior engineers and sci
entists who have played a 
leading role in developing 
the Kearfott inertial 
systems and components 
which have been selected 
for application In over 80 
aircraft and 16 major 
missile systems. Gary now 
leans to the choice of U 
permanent assignment in 
the Electronics Lab but 
has decided to work a few 
months in the advanced 
Gyrodynamics Division, be
fore coming to a decision.
Opportunities 
at Kearfott 
are expanding
Long occupying a unique position tn 
the fields of electronics and electro
mechanical components and precision 
instrumentation, Kearfott  in recent 
years  has moved more and more into 
the development of complete systems. 
This has lead to major staff expansion 
at all levels, including a sizable num
ber of positions for recent graduates 
in all 4 major company units:
EWM 'sB3MrB 01a1B1D

Through its flexible TRAINING 
PROGRAM, Kearfott offers young 
engineers freedom to explore the field, 
before selecting the broad area best 
fueling individual interests. 
Remarkable rapid professional 
advancement is possible  and likely 
 through- the PROMOTION BY
