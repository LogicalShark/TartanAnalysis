Important Draft Renovations
Draft Resistance By North Hills Man
by Sharon Peruzzi
David Worstell. a North Hills 
resident, currently studying at 
the University of Chicago, re
cently joined the ranks of those
2.500 conscious objectors to the 
Selective Service Law who. by 
returning their draft cards to the 
Attorney General, have been re
classified 1-A and ordered for in
duction.
After being refused a stay of 
induction in the United States 
Federal District Court, presided 
over by Judge Rosenburg, Wor
steds attorney has appealed his 
case to the Third District Court 
in Philadelphia which has sched
uled his hearing for May 20.
Wanting only to stop this in
sane and obsene war which dis
honors the country and subverts 
its democratic traditions. Wor
stell returned his draft card last 
August because he said that there 
was no other logical and syste
matic way of stating his beliefs. 
Skeptical of all traditional abso
lutes which are embodied in rig
id laws. Worstell related his di
lemma to that of the law-abiding 
German citizen who. under the 
leadership of Hitler, assented to 
a system of militarism and mur
der.
Worstell further states that his 
refusal to co-operate with the 
conscription law has little to do 
with this war in Vietnam, but a 
great deal to do with his beliefs, 
about individual responsibility. 
This is the responsibility not of 
t h e man who dissents out of 
hatred, but who dissents because 
of a feeling of fellowship to' 
which we are all bound together 
in and exuberant spontaneity of 
life.
Worstell savs that he and hun
dreds have made the choice. They 
oppose conscription because it is 
symbolic of the violent and de
monic elements in our society. 
In doing so, they feel they are at
tempting to build peaceful com
munities where individuals can 
live and work together.
Those who wish to join him in 
his quest for freedom may call

and Freedom Center, located on 
Ellsworth Ave.. phone <412-362-

Pat Bowman Leads New AWS Officers
New officers ot CMU s Asso
ciation of Women Students have, 
been elected and will assume 
their positions officially next fall. 
Pat Bowman is the president
elect. First vice-president is Jane 
Gillis. Second vice-president' is 
Carol Schlossman. Judy Resnik 
and Diane Marburger will take 
the offices of secretary and treas
urer. respectively. The new- offi
cers and the entire board wish to 
express their appreciation of the 
outgoing officers, and especially 
to Marilvn Blitz.
New Deferment Laws Should Be Studied
by David R. Morrison
This coming June, senior men 
will be graduating from two in
stitutions. both from CMU and 
from their stable 2-S draft classi
fication. Previously, those desir
ing to enter graduate school could 
go through the regular legal 
channels and be granted a renew
able 2-S classification. However, 
with the recent innovations in the 
draft laws, the hopeful graduate 
student can, at most, be given a 
IS-C status for one year. It is. 
therefore, of a definite advantage 
to know all the legal procedures 
applying to an extenuation of the
1S-C classification.
According to General Hershey,
1.8000.000 men reach the age of
18 each year but only a total of
300.000 (average since 1965) each 
year are called up. That means 
one out of six men are drafted, 
not 90 per cent as some who wrap 
statistics say. Being drafted is not 
an inexorable doom!
What should a registrant do if 
he gets an undesirable draft class
ification such as 1-A? Did you 
know that an appeal forfeits the 
right of a personal appearance 
before the local board, and its at 
the local board level where 95 
per cent of all the draft reclassifi
cations are made? In order to 
maximize your civil rights under 
the law. adhere to the following 
reclassification procedure:
1. Visit a draft counselor on 
your campus by phoning: John 
Parkman, ext. 489; Gary Aiken, 
ext. 489; Hank Mashburn, ext. 
323; Ed Fuller, ext. 842.
2. Within 30 days of reclassifi
cation request a personal appear
ance.
3. At the same time, request a 
meeting with your Government 
Appeal Agent to take place be
fore the personal appearance by 
writing to the draft board.
4. After the personal appear
ance if you are again reclassified 
into an undesirable classification, 
request another appointment with 
the Government Appeal Agent 
and appeal your classification 
within 30 days.
5. If you receive an undesir
able classification after the ap
peal, your draft counselor will 
advise you further.
This entire process takes up to 
one year! You cannot by law be 
inducted during this period 
(Regs. Sec. 1624.3and 1626.41).
In the Spring of 1965. a student 
failed to meet the requirements 
for a II-S because of low class 
standing. In September. 1965. he 
was reclassified 1-A which he ap
pealed. He was given a 1-S-C un
til June. 1966. whereupon he was 
again reclassified l-A. He began 
the reclassification procedure list
ed above which took him to June. 
1967. when he received another
1-A. On June 30. 1967. Congress

State Legislation Curbs Demonstration
by John Mera
Legislation to curb student 
demonstrations on state-aided col
leges and universities has been 
introduced in the Pennsylvania 
House of Representatives in Har
risburg on Tuesday. May 7. The 
legislation consists of two sepa
rate bills both sponsored by Rep. 
Jules Filo of West Mifflin and 
co-sponsored by Rep. Robert A. 
Geisler and Paul W. Miller of 
Pittsburgh, all Democrats.
The first bill calls for the dis
missal of students who participate 
in demonstrations that interfere 
with the educational and adminis
trative activities of state colleges 
and universities. The purpose of 
the second bill is to take away 
state scholarships from students 
participating in similar activities 
and to prevent them from getting 
further aid as long as they engage in disruptive demonstra
tions.
Approximately 45 per cent of 
the Carnegie-Mellon University 
student body is from Pennsyl
vania. If enacted, the first bill 
will not affect CMU The state 
does not have jurisdiction over 
state residents attending private
ly owned colleges. However, the 
second bill does empower the 
state to take away scholarships 
from any student receiving state 
aid. Eligibility for such aid is 
not decided by the school but by 
a state scholarship board. This 
bill could be an effective weapon 
to prevent student demonstra
tions.
This reporter interviewed Rep. 
Filo and Geisler to find out their 
motivation for the legislation. 
Their views were identical. Rep. 
Geisler who had studied one year 
at the Duquesne Law School back 
in 1946 admits that he is not a 
college man and has limited 
knowledge of what goes on in a 
college.
His reason for the legislation 
is to prevent the kind of student 
demonstrations that have occur
red at Columbia University in 
New York and Cheney State Col
lege in Delaware County. His 
opinion is that students should 
protest through legal channels 
only. Rep. Filo has never atten
ded a college or university but 
claims expertise on educational 
matters.
Both Geisler and Filo feel 
that students have stepped over 
the bounds of academic freedom 
into civil disobddience and the 
way to deal with them is through 
dismissals and stopping finan
cial aid. Presently, the bills are 
under consideration by the House 
Basic Education Committee pass
age this legislative year which 
ends in June.

HOURS
EXTENDED TO 4:00 A.M.
Hunt Library will remain 
open until 4:00 a.m. every 
da/ until May 26th.
In an effort to clarify the need 
for an office to coordinate social

by Jenifer Digby
Final preparations for next fall s 
Freshman Camp are being made 
this week before the start of final 
exams and the close of school. 
Thirty - eight camp counselors 
have been selected to assist the 
student executive staff, the advi
sors. and the faculty assistants 
during the three day session next 
fall. Sam Platt is chairman of the 
committee, assisted by Nancy 
Mosca. They have divided the re
sponsibilities for Camp events be
tween two sub-committees.
Pat Bowman and Dan Nagin 
co-chair the Program Committee. 
The committee will schedule 
four events into the campers 
agenda: Philosophies. Key
note Speaker. Distances. and 
a discussion of topics that are 
central to the first three. The Pro
gram Committee intends to pre
sent. through these events and dis
cussion sessions, vignettes of cam
pus life and related community 
themes. Our Being a Society of, 
Innocent Bystanders is the overa 11 thematic concern and the 
committee hopes to direct fresh
men thoughts not only toward 
campus life, but into community 
involvement as well.
Diane Marburger and Bob Harbage head the Entertainment 
Committee, whose primary func
tion is to provide continuous ac
tivities and. of course, entertain
ment. On the agenda this fall 
besides the traditionals at camp, 
are several new ideas, the Kiltie 
Band will greet the freshmen 
upon arrival at Camp Lutherlyn 
on Sept. 11 and will rouse them 
both mornings during their stay.
The evenings events will be
gin at 8:30 with a Coffee House, 
complete with underground films, 
and later the scene will shift to 
haywagons and an old-fashioned 
hayride. A Casino and a square 
dance will be held simultaneous
ly on the following evening and 
at 10:30 all will gather for an in
formal camp fire hour.
During the day, between the 
hours of 11 am and 3 pm. the 
campers will have the usual ath
letic events to choose from. And 
for early risers there will be 
morning swims at 6 a.m.
Jewell Walker will lend his 
unique pantomime talents to the 
entertainment agenda. And to add 
to the frivolity, the Committees 
theme will be Cartoon Charact
ers, with the committee staff 
matching Frosh dinks with their 
Mickey Mouse ears.
sentatives of organized forces in
cluded Gordy Cohn and Jacqui 
Pratt of the Social Service Com
mittee and Tom Huff and Heather 
Smith of the Campus YM-YWCA. 
Bob Bensel, senior architect spoke 
about his experiences working in 
a store-front office set up to fur
nish professional quality archi
tects services to an area badly 
in need of help, but unable to af 
ford normal tees. Also present 
were Dave Kamons of the Tartan 
and Len Wanetik. Gene Payne 
and Dave Shuck.
Dean Brown emphasized that 
talks are strictly exploratory, bent 
at determining what will best fit 
the need of the campus and of 
those whom action projects aid. 
As a bose for elaboration, he cit
ed existing setups at Harvard and 
MIT. The Ivy, called the Phillip 
Brooks House, has been establish
ed by the Board of Trustees and 
is run by a graduate student work* 
ing part time. The MIT Social 
Service Committee is staffed by 
faculty wives and has been re
ported as being highly successful 
and fostering very good commun
ity relations and an effective liason. During the rest of the discus
sion, opinion favored a more pro
fessional organization than a vol
unteer-staffed office.
Miss Pratt proposed that some 
agency is necessary to handle the 
paperwork associated with social 
action projects and to maintain 
convenient channels of communi
cation between going projects 
and the raw labor represented by 
the student body; similarly it 
would be able to co-ordinate par
allel groups and serve to consoli
date small groups doing similar 
work, adding a measure of effi
ciency to these operations. Also, 
and administrative office would 
lend extra legitimacy to social ac
tion work, which could serve to 
greatly increase participation 
from the College of Engineering 
and Science where high values 
are placed on official sanction.

project talk however, be a seri(Continued on Page 4)

EDITORIAL
Going & Coming: Is Student Govt Listening?
Student Congress has proposed an activities fee to be instituted 
next term. The administration has approved the proposal with the fol
lowing modification: The fee is to be $20 instead of the original $10. 
but tuition is to be cut $10 per year. What they have really done is to 
divert ten dollars of our tuition directly in to Student Government. 
Instead of covertly stocking the S.G. account, the administration is 
making the fact more obvious; we still have to pay $1960 regardless of 
how its labelled.
Where exactly have the S.G. funds come from before the fee?. 
How much of next years planned budget comes from the new fee and 
how much from administrative funds? Most important, what will we 
get for ten dollars a year?
The only question that we can attempt to answer is the last. S.G. 
proposes to subsidize the Thistle to reduce its cost; it plans to subsi
dize the big weekends so we can have better entertainment at lower 
cost; it plans to institute a program of speakers of higher quality than 
it has in years past; it projects two mid-year concerts with nationally 
famous talent at low cost. For these who will take advantage of all the 
offerings the fee is seemingly a good deal. There still exists the ques
tion of the number of students who wont go to concerts, lectures, or 
Homecoming; who wont buy a Thistle regardless of price. They must 
pay for something they choose not to receive. What must be done about 
them? Think about it over the summer. Bills will be due four months 
from the day after tomorrow.
We have one final request of the financial establishment of Stu
dent Government. The Finance Committee will be parcelling out 
about $60,000 next year. They are about to institute a rather thorough 
examination of the requests for appropriations from nearly all student 
organizations; this is proper. On the other hand, why dont they pub
lish a detailed balance sheet of all their receipts and expenditures? 
We think we know how much goes into the bright green money mach
ine, but how it goes out is still a mystery. We are all direct stockhold
ers and have a right to know.
We would like to comment on the orientation program. Most of 
the incoming freshmen will be expecting a totally new, exciting, stim
ulating experience. They will be turned loose to formulate values, 
commitments, ethics, and morals. The Orientation Program has as its 
raw material virtually one thousand human lives. What is it trying to 
make of them?
These youngsters dont want their first taste of college life to be 
the same old social action they had in high school on a bigger scale. 
Why not try to get them thinking about why theyre spending $10,000 
and four years for a diploma? Start inquiry about their relationships 
with themselves as well as with each other. There is a fascinating 
parlor-game sensitivity training concept called the Micro-Lab. It 
would be feasible to incorporate this into the regular program. It 
would stir interest in T-group sensitivity training and could result in 
an entire class knowing itself to a depth unprecedented at CMU. When 
this was tried at Cal Tech the results were overwhelmingly rewarding.
In addition to introducing the Freshmen to themselves, orientation 
should introduce them to Pittsburgh. CMU is not a walled enclave in 
the heart of the city. Starting next year effort must be made to inte
grate new students into the cultural and civic life here; It has taken 
some of us as much as four years of undirected exploration to figure out 
what goes on in this city; undoubtedly some students must spend four 
years here and never know.
The Orientation Committee has the opportunity to produce a Fresh
man class that will revitalize this university; or it can allow next 
years influx to be quietly drained of their energy and ability to inno
vate, and thus perpetuate the existing system of organized apathy.

Fraternity System 
Is Child Disease
Editor, the Tartan:
I have had the extreme mis
fortune to have lived directly 
across the street from the frater
nity houses this year. It's been 
an experience nobody needs. In 
my year of observation of the 
system, apart from personal in
consideration of hours of super 
amplified music (?) blasted at 
me. 3 A.M. Honda practice in the 
driveways, drunken yelling and 
shouting in the early hours, and 
water thrown through my window,
I have a few personal comments 
on the fraternity system in gen
eral.
The fraternity system appears 
to me much like a dangerous 
childhood disease which can seri
ously retard individual growth, 
produce irresponsible and destruc
tive behavior and lead to idiocy 
(some fraternity alumni provide 
illustration).
Those anxious, lost people who 
need to join the system to find 
status, prestige, identification and 
security lose something of far 
greater value in themselves as 
individuals. They often give up 
the best parts of themselves - hon
esty. consideration, respect for 
the rights of others, a sense of 
their own personal worth and dig
nity and the opportunity to think 
for themselves and to make their 
own decisions. Its the price of 
membership.
The system breeds and main
tains discrimination of the worst 
kind, uncaring of those whom they 
reject and misusing talents of 
those whom they accept.
Sporadic, well-advertised dis
plays of social concern hardly 
make up for the frequent, day-today indignities they inflict upon 
others, including their own bro
thers. in the form of public incon
sideration and humiliation. Of 
course, its all in the name of fun 
and high spirits. There are many, 
though more subtle similarities in 
the sorority system.
I have met some fine indivi
duals in both fraternity and sor
ority systems who are aware of 
and try to improve them but these 
individuals are too few in num
bers.
Perhaps there is some value 
gained by those who survive and 
escape the system, but even they 
dont come through unscathed. 
I'm sure. Those who don't make 
it probably never fully mature. 
The saddest factor is that there is 
so much good potential in a group 
of healthy, intelligent young men 
and women that is wasted.

Frosh Orientation 
Lacking Significance
Editor, the Tartan:
I read with dismay in this paper 
last week that next year's Orien
tation was designed to help 
freshmen become a part of the 
school more quickly and painless
ly. Its speakers are to discuss 
only entertaining and stimulating 
subjects and the entire emphasis 
of Orientation is to be on the ab
sorption smoothly and without 
confusion" of the frosh. If these 
plans are successful, our new col
lege students will find them cogs 
in our machine before they ever 
know what hit them, they will 
have been betrayed into the sysstem and never doubt it
I am aware that college will 
inevitably be. for most of the 
freshmen, a new and exciting ex
perience; an adventure. In pre
vious years an attempt was made
to make the freshman experience 
not only an adventure but an ex
perience. and the freshman was 
asked to question his moral, ethi
cal. political, and religious pre
conceptions about the world. A 
strong challenge was presented, 
the gauntlet flung at the new col
lege class. Though they did not 
alter character in some cases and 
bored in others, these Orientations 
at least tried to make the fresh
man aware of the fact that some 
people today disagree with him. 
In comparison, this year's pro
gram seems only a round of deb 
coming-out parties without sig
nificance or meaning!
If this is what this school de
sires. let it be so. But last week
I got a letter soliciting me five 
dollars so that high Risk stu
dents could come to CMU free. 
If we seriously want high risk 
students here, then something com
mensurate must be done so that 
our present low risk crop does
n't stay as complacent as they 
seem.
Charity is no substitute for ac
tion - that is a phase our parents 
have repudiated in innumerable 
funds and appeals. Do we 
equate money with purpose or 
do we ask more of ourselves and 
our school?
This Orientation is very bad 
and badlv intentioned. for col
lege should not be a painless ex
perience. If freshmen are not. in 
our New University tobeshowr 
some cause for unhappiness, then 
we, the University, are a failure.
The Tartan article concludes: 
At present there will be no 
classes held or uniformative books 
assigned for freshmen to read.
I say assign some - and talk about 
something. I positively suggest 
that The Student as Nigger (re
member that!) should be a part 
of each Orientation folder, and 
that some book, perhaps Good
mans Growing Up Absurd be 
assigned and discussed. If nothing
I understand that it is because 
no one wants it done.

Buggy Problem 
Not Insignificant
Editor, the Tartan:
As a member of the fraternity 
system. I wish to question Mr. 
Woolleys definitions of the words 
petty and class as he applied 
them to the events surrounding 
Spring Carnival Sweepstakes this 
vear.
Does the disqualification of the 
Sigma Nu buggies appear as ridi
culous and petty as Mr. Woolley 
seems to think when you consider 
the fact that the friend who 
tightened eight nuts on the 
wheels before the race, and as
sisted Sigma Nu at a number of 
the pre-race free-rolls. was not 
only a past member of another 
fraternity, but served on its buggy 
committee for two years in pre
paration for assuming the duties 
of chairman the following year? 
From the rather obvious changes 
in performance of the Sigma Nu 
Buggies in the short span of one 
year, it would appear that the 
friends assistance in rela
tion to the race was all but in
significant.
If anyone wishes to question 
the class of the CMU frater
nity system, especially in the con
text of moral ethics, he certainly 
has that right - but I would sug
gest that Mr. Woolley direct his 
first inquiries at a mirror.

Pass-Fail Praised 
By Delta Skull
Editor, the Tartan:
Delta Skull, as the junior men s 
honorary, feels that it is the duty 
of an honorary to comment on 
events that alter the academic 
atmosphere of the campus. The 
new college of Humanities and 
Social Sciences as proposed in A 
NEW COLLEGE is an important 
step in the development of Car
negie Mellon University, and as 
such deserves the thoughts and 
consideration of all people invol
ved in the University. Delta Skull 
decided to study the proposal for 
the new college and present to the 
campus a report summarizing the 
reactions of its members.
Most of the members apprecia
ted the efforts of the committee 
in compiling the proposal for the 
college and agreed with the basic 
goals and ideas presented in the 
report. They considered the pro
gram for the freshman year as in
teresting and worthwhile. The 
pass-fail system was particularly 
praised. Some fear was expressed 
that after the freshman year the 
students would be tossed in regu
lar CMU courses and the whole 
freshman year wasted.
The idea of the metacurriculum 
wTas highly favored, although 
most were concerned about how 
the students would get the time 
to do everything that the courses 
and the extra activities would re
quire. All attempts to bring about 
closer student-faculty relations 
drew praise from all members. 
These attempts included the meta
curriculum, the nature of fresh
man program, proposed teaching 
loads, and new campus facilities.
The suggestion that seniors be 
involved in teaching freshman and 
sophomores drew criticism and 
some praise. Some people felt 
that students paying $1950.00 a 
year deserved more than a stu
dent teacher. The experience 
would be great for the senior.
The proposal for the new col
lege has many good ideas, some 
bad ideas, and many unknowns. 
The college should improve with 
the experience of its staff, and 
should be a great asset to the cam
pus. Delta Skull encourages all 
members of the academic com
munity to support the new college.

Service Committee 
To Unite Activists
Editor, the Tartan:
Len Wanetiks letter in last 
week's Tartan emphasized the 
need for more coordination of 
the social service activities on 
campus. It was obvious from this 
letter that Len has no idea of 
many projects that are taking 
place on campus, some of which 
have been set up bv the Social 
Service Committee.
This committee was set up to 
inform students on what was hap
pening in the area of social action. 
We felt that there were many pro
jects being done by Tech students 
that were very similar to each 
other, and because these students 
were not aware that similar pro
jects were being undertaken, 
there was a great deal of dupli
cation and wasted effort. We hop
ed that we could bring all the 
activists on the campus together, 
so that by combining their skills 
they would be able to accomplish 
more.
Unfortunately, some of the 
more egotistic activists, such as

Need Results Stated: Vote for Integration
Editor, the Tartan:
Every contribution to the Dr.

to which the drive is supported 
by student leaders
.. As of last Friday. May 11, more

more, $200 has been pledged by 
the Building Service Employees

In a recent letter to the TAR

his endorsement of the Martin

Fund and his hope for the suc
cess of endeavor which aims at 
providing funds to enable stu
dents from underprivildged areas, 
such as Negroes, to attend CMU.
Dr. Stever stated, The stu
dents and faculty involved are to 
be commended for conceiving the 
idea of establishing a Martin 
Luther King. Jr.. Scholarship 
Fund at Carnegie Mellon University. I support this idea with 
enthusiasm and urge ail mem
bers of the campus community 
to consider helping to establish 
this scholarship through their 
personal gifts.

Scholarship Drive.
With only 20 black students 
among 2995 undergraduated, Carnegie-Mellon is 99 and 43 100 per
cent white. This makes the least 
integrated college in Pittsburgh. 
And the problem is not entirely 
financial. In the ghetto we have 
to overcome our image as a white 
mans campus. Although NEED 
has helped 1.168 students to at
tend some 100 different colleges 
since 1963. there are only four 
NEED scholars on our campus. 
By symbolizing our determina
tion to achieve a truly integrated 
university, a high participation 
rate will help attract more black 
scholars to our campus.
Sincerely,

New Deferment Laws

was automatically entitled to a 
II-S regardless of class standing. 
It took over two years but*he stav
ed in school and finally got his 
II-S by fighting for it. while his 
friends who were in the same 
boat gave up.
The meeting with a Govern
ment Appeal Agent is important 
since he is a lawyer who will an
swer your questions at no charge. 
Most people try to duck out of 
the draft rather than learn the 
facts and fight for a deferment.
For instance, one man, whose 
wife w*as pregnant, tried to fake 
a physical by slipping in a vial 
of his wife's urine instead of his 
own. A few weeks later two FBI 
agents paid him a visit and in
formed him that he was the first 
draftee to be pregnant. He was 
then indicted for draft evasion. 
Since he had not requested and 
received a II-S since June 30. 
1967, he was entitled to a III-A 
mandatory exemption for future 
fatherhood, but did not know the 
law!

Mr. Wanetik. felt that this com
mittee would only stifle their ef
forts. They did not feel that any 
organized effort to convey their 
experience or enthusiasm to un
derclassmen would be valuable. 
Instead, they thought that if any 
student was really interested in 
working on social problems he did 
not need any committee to facili
tate the conversions of their feel
ings into action. Supposedly, they 
would actively seek out such peo
ple as Mr. Wanetik for advice.
We vehemently expressed the 
feeling that many students might
potentially be interested in social 
action, but where will they be ex
posed to it if not through a work
ing organization? We have been 
operating this year under the 
philosophy that only through co
ordinated efforts can anything be 
accomplished. So far some of our 
projects have been to place stu
dent tutors in the Hill District, 
to work with the freshman faculty 
committee on revising the curri
culum and to try to make the com
mittee give the engineering and 
science student more courses in 
the social sciences.
Having worked with the New 
College, helping them to plan 
their courses and programs, hav
ing obtained Norman Johnson and 
Daryl Bern to speak to the fresh
men at Orientation next fall, hav
ing received offers from the mem
bers of the President's Council 
on Model Cities to speak next 
year, and, contrary to Mr. Wanetik's observations, having person
ally attended meetings of the 
YMCA action committee, mem
bers of the Social Service Com
mittee have presented a start 
towTard involvement in commun
ity affairs.
The Kerner Commission's Re
port on Civil Disorders states that 
white racism is at the center of 
this country's problems. It is up 
to the university to actively seek 
to alleviate this situation. TO YOU 
MR. ADMINISTRATOR. WE PUT 
THIS CHALLENGE.
Sincerely.

McCarthy Winner In College Primary
On April 24, CHOICE 68 Nat
ional Collegiate Presidential 
Primary was held, giving college 
students a chance to exhibit their 
preferences among presidential 
candidates. A regional breakdown 
of returns reveals that extremely 
strong performances on Eastern 
and Western Campuses provided 
the key to Eugene McCarthy's 
substantial victory. Of the ten re
gions. McCarthy won six with 
Robert Kennedy the closest rival 
running far behind. Richard Nix
on won in the Southeast, South
west, and Southern sectors. Sena
tor Kennedy ran consistent second 
in seven out of ten sectors, and 
ran surprisingly well in the South
east and Southern sectors.
. Although running fourth in 
CHOICE 68. Governor Nelson 
Rockefeller of New York polled 
the highest number of combined 
second and third place votes. Run
ning second was, again, McCar
thy. third was Kennedy, and fourth 
Nixon. As their second or third 
choice, Kennedy voters displayed 
more willingness to vote for Mc
Carthy, than did McCarthy voters 
toward Kennedy.
In response to the referendum 
questions on the ballot. 85 per
cent of McCaf thy supporters pre
ferred either a phased reduction 
in U.S., military activity or im
mediate withdrawal of U.S. for
ces from Vietnam, while 69 per
cent of Kennedy supporters prefered the same action. Reagan 
and Nixon were the two Repub
licans representing the most sup
port for increased and all-out mili
tary effort in Vietnam: 65 per
cent of Reagans and 52 per cent 
of Nixon's chose those two courses 
of action. Reagan and Wallace re
presented the most support for 
use of nuclear weapons on North 
Vietnam. In total, students favor
ed reduction of U.S. military act
ivity in Vietnam, temporary sus
pension of the bombing and edu
cation as the area that should re
ceive the highest priority in gov
ernment spending to meet the 
urban crisis.

New Panhel Officers 
Aspiring for Unity
The Greek system has been de
scribed as a group of separate 
units, each in competition with 
each other, fighting to be the 
best, to be on top. Yet to survive, 
the whole system must be unified 
within a framework of common 
interests, ideals, and goals. The 
Panhellenic Association of Carnegie-Mellon University, like the 
other twenty-seven member sor
orities of the National Panhell
enic Conference, aspire to pro
vide such a framework for the 
seven sororities on our campus, to 
strengthen the Greek system.
The new 1968-69 officers of Pan
hel : Jackie Schwab, Delta Gamma
President; Claudia Wolfe, Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, vice-president; 
Judy Resnik, Alpha Epsilon Phi, 
secretary; Barbara Cordon, Delta 
Gamma, treasurer; are now plan
ning for a more effective, useful 
organization among Greek Women.

ous drawback in some cases. It 
was pointed out by those who had 
dealt with people in the Hill Dist r i c t, notably Messrs. Bensel. 
Wanetik, and Payne, that CMU 
is synonymous with the white es
tablishment. To be associated 
with the university could mean 
early death for any project which 
attempted to contact people al
lied in any way with Black Sep
aratism. Most white workers are 
tolerated at best. A white worker 
labelled Carnegie-Mellon would 
be almost worthless. Furthermore. 
Len said that it is important to 
use existing lines of contact into 
places like the Hill, for residents 
would as soon ignore aid projects 
rather than attempt to find new 
lines of communication.
A consensus was formed that 
projects into the ghetto area could 
best be handled by the Y. They 
already are coordinating ACTION-Housing, Link tutorships, 
and numerous other groups. They 
have working lines of communi
cation and contacts in the ghetto, 
and they have a legitimacy that a 
new office would be sorely lack
ing. It has already started to func
tion as a clearing-house and is de
veloping a pattern that could eas
ily be expanded to operate an all
campus agency with minimal ex
penditure of time and effort.
Mr. Huff and Miss Smith were 
very optimistic that the Y could 
handle co-ordinating social action 
groups and contacts off-campus, 
but that it was plagued with lack 
of volunteers on campus. They 
felt that in addition to serving as 
an information pool, the new 
agency must promote and gener
ate interest in social action work. 
Once students are imbued with 
some enthusiasm they will seek 
out means to convert their raw 
energy into useful work.
It was pointed out that merely 
setting up committees and dis
cussing possibilities will do no 
good. Action is needed and it 
must come soon. People are need
ed not only in inter-racial work 
but in working with community 
action projects within the white 
community. There also seems to 
be necessary changes in the atti
tude of the University as an in
stitution and as a meta-personal
ity.
As an opinion exploring session, 
the meeting was fairly successful. 
Some said that a new agency was 
the last thing this campus and 
this city needed; others, that a 
channel for information for stu
dents looking for work and groups 
looking for workers would be of 
uncountable benefit. The nature 
of the office might be an expan
sion of the existing Y facilities or 
it might be better staffed with a 
full-time administrator with ex
perience in sociology or social 
work. It might be completely pas
sive or it might serve as a center 
for promotional campaigns. The 
dialogue has been initiated, but 
it must not end just in talk. A de
cision must be reached and acted 
on. It is probably too late for any
thing constructive to be effected 
this year, but certainly we will 
see results from this research soon 
after next year begins._____________

Wednesday, May 15, 1968THE TARTANPage 5University Attempts to Aid Underprivileged Students
Call to Membership Graphic Arts Show PPG FellowshipBy the Honoraries At Pandemonium Won by Dave Miller
Below is a recent reply to me 
from Stever on the issue of what 
CMU is doing for the less for
tunate of the world.
Yours
Frank Morra, Jr.
Dear Mr. Morra:
Thank you for your two recent 
letters. Since you made no men
tion of them, perhaps you are 
unaware of the things the Uni
versity has been doing over the 
past few years in attempting to 
attack some of the problems of 
the disadvantaged, and particular
ly of the Negro.
Almost five years ago, the Uni
versity undertook a program to 
motivate able but otherwise dis
advantaged youngsters to go on 
to college and to provide them 
with the academic qualifications 
to do so. The program, called 
SCOP, served as one of the major 
models for the Upward Bound Pro
gram subsequently undertaken by 
the Federal Government. Our 
History Department has for sev
eral years been engaged in an ex
tensive program of training soc
ial science teachers in predom
inantly Negro colleges and in de
veloping a curriculum suited to 
the needs and abilities of students 
attending such colleges. During 
the past year, four members of the 
Architecture faculty set up a store
front office in the Hill District 
where they and their students work 
with residents of that area in evol
ving new design concepts adapted 
to the needs of the community. 
Also, during the past year, the 
Carnegie Education Center has 
been developing and testing a 
new seventh grade curriculum for 
slow-learning students. In imple
menting this, at least three mem
bers of our faculty have been tea
ching regularly at Westinghouse 
High School in the HomewoodBrushton Area.
The low percentage of Negro 
students and of professional staff 
on our campus has been of con
cern to the faculty and adminis
tration for some time. Several 
months ago, the matter was dis
cussed in the Academic Affairs 
Committee and in the several 
College Councils. Out of these 
discussions, a group was set up to 
determine what kinds of educa
tional programs will be needed 
to handle students who do not 
meet our normal academic stan
dards. If we are to increase sub
stantially the number of Negro 
students on our campus, we must 
seek those who are not adequate
ly prepared under our present 
standards, and it would be a shame 
to merely admit them and throw 
them into the normal competition 
of our classrooms without some 
special assistance. The Vice Pres
ident for Academic Affairs and 
the Deans of the Colleges are 
also working on ways to intensify 
our recruitment of Negro faculty. 
You know, of course, that the stu
dents and faculty are currently 
engaged in a campaign to seek 
additional funds for Negro stu
dents.
It would be folly to say that 
everything is being done that can 
be done to solve the problems of 
social injustices. Yet the Univer
sity is concerned about these prob
lems, it has in the past worked on 
some of them, and it will continue 
to seek appropriate ways to do 
more. It was this concern that 
lies behind the recent establish
ment of the School of Urban and 
Public Affairs which, as it de
velops, will bring even greater 
intellectual power to bear on the 
problems of our cities, of which 
the housing, employment and edu 
cation of the Negro are certainly 
among the most important and
pervasive.
Sincerely yours,
H. Guyford Stever
Dear Mr. Stever:
Thank you for your recent re
ply to my questions about Carnegie-Mellons position on aiding 
the underprivileged.
I would also like to commend 
the University on its recent accep
tance of one female Negro stu
dent from a very poor background.
I understand, however, that 
a number of underprivileged but 
highly motivated students from 
an Ohio UPWARD BOUND Pro
ject are currently being turned 
away by asmissions because next 
years quotas have been filled
I feel that the student tutoring 
support collected by George Madaras of the Psycholo-y Depart
ment, and the faculty support cur
rently being collected by Jim Hastie of the History Department 
should help alloy the fears that 
these students (and others like 
them) would be thrown to the 
wolves if admitted to CMU.
If a full load of courses would 
inundate such students, may I sug
gest that we admit them into a 
five-year program with tutoring 
support?
May I suggest quite strongly, 
moreover, that CMU accept a 
number eg such students with 
full financial aid for next fall - 
not at some date in the distant 
future. Special admissions such 
as these should not be faulted be
cause our normal admissions have 
been closed. The need is clear, 
and the means of coping with the 
increased requirements of such 
students seems to be at hand.
Could not such an admissions 
policy be immediately imple
mented?
Frank Morra, Jr.Summer Tutorials Need Volunteers
Volunteers are needed for sum
mer turotials in Pittsburgh, CMU 
has responded with almost two 
dozen volunteers, but there is 
still a need for others to work in 
a constructive, mutually signifi
cant relationship with Pittsburgh 
youth
NEED (Negro Educational Em
ergency Drive) is beginning its 
first tutorial program this summer. 
Tutors in specific academic areas 
are needed to work with college 
and pre-college students. The 
students involved are those pre
sently receiving financial aid 
from NEED but also requiring 
some academic help in their col
lege or pre-college work. All 
tutoring in the NEED program 
will be done at Duquesne Uni
versity. unless other arrangements 
are made by both parties or a 
tutoring team. Training and intro
duction take place at the end of 
June: tutoring from the begin
ning of July until mid-August.
ACTION housing (Allegheny 
Council to Improve Our Neigh
borhoods) will again have its 
valuable program in supplemen
tary education functioning this 
summer. Action Housing works 
with all age levels and in various 
subjects and skills. Locations for 
tutoring are in five different neigh
borhoods: North Park, Perry Hill
top, Homewood-Brushton, Hazel
wood and Lawrenceville. Tutor
ing sessions are expected to take 
place four or five times a week; 
morningsMonday, Thursday,
afternoonsMonday-Friday. Pro
bably best done by someone with 
a light schedule this summer! 
Thorough training starts on June 
25th here at CMU.

I.M. Review
The softball season was com
pleted last week with four downto-the-wire finishes. The EJ Carp 
topped BTP A 10-8 in a head 
to head confrontation between 
pitchers Meister and Gschnell. 
Since both teams entered the 
game with identical 4-0 slates, 
the EJ victory placed them in 
first place and BTP second. The 
Pirates league had a similar onetwo finish when GSIA P de
feated TDP A 19-8.
The Yankees and Cubs league 
races both resulted in three way 
ties for first, necessitating play
off games to break the deadlocks. 
The EJ phaseouts and the Old 
Men each drew a bye insuring 
both of at least second place. 
SAE A" avenged an early sea
son loss to BTP B by with a 
decisive 18.9 victory. SAE pro
ceeded to defeat the Phaseouts 
14-10 to earn the number one 
slot in the Yankees league. Malizia sent two EJ pitches into or
bit to lead the SAE attack.
ATO A beat SN Black'' 6-2 
but finished second in the Cub's 
league when they dropped a 17- 
12 decision to the Old Men who 
finished first.
Yankees League
In regular season action, the
Met Knights forfeited to the
Phaseouts and lost to BTP B

The CMU Track team suffered two crushing defeats in the last 
week, one to Westminister and the other to Grove City. Westminister 
visited the Tech Bowl on Tuesday. May 7 and defeated the Tartans 
102-43. Westminister took 14 of 17 first places to dominate the meet. 
The highlight of the day occurred when Steve Avlor broke the school 
record in the triple jump with a leap of 41 9%, vet the jump was only 
good enough for second place against powerful Waynesburg.
Then two days later. Grove City came here to repeat the domina
tion of the CMU team. In this meet Grove City won 13 of 16 events, 
sweeping the track events but getting only 3 out of 6 in the field.
The Tartan record is now 3-8 with two away meets remaining on 
the schedule-Western Reserve Wed. May 15 & Allegheny Sat. May 18.

After being extended to the lim
it against Grove City, the netters 
came back home to extend their 
undefeated string at home to 14 
over a three year period by easily 
defeating Geneva. 9-0. The scores 
were:

and Walker. 6-4, 6-3 
Anderson and Beissinger def. Petrony and Lepek. 6-0, 6-3
On the Saturday afternoon of 
Spring Carnival, a bunch of tired 
but determined Tech netters left 
their dates and traveled to New 
Wilmington to face the West
minster Titans on their Parents 
Day, amid a baseball game, track 
meet, golf match, and sailing re
gatta. Despite the pageantry, the 
netters methodically won 7-2 over 
the rival Titans. Khan had a rough 
time against Ross and finally won, 
6-2, 7-5, on a blistered foot which 
kept him out of the doubles com
petition.
Lowe won easily, 6-2, 6-1, over 
Thompson; Smolens won over 
Harrison, 6-4, 6-3; Hicken defeat
ed Olsen, 7-5, 6-0; Wahedi tri
umphed over Beshore, 6-1, 6-2; 
and Fisher won over Kennedy, 6-
2, 6-1. In the doubles, Lowe and 
Smolens put their undefeated 
string on the line against a strong 
first doubles team of Ross and 
Harrison and won a thrilling 
match, 7-5, 9-7. The other doubles 
teams did not fare as well, how
ever, as Wright and Myers were 
defeated by Thompson and Olsen, 
6-4, 6-4, and Anderson and Beis
singer lost to Beshore and McGill,
6-4, 6-2.
Going into the final match 
against Pitt, several netters have 
outstanding undefeated strings. 
Khan, the teams most valuable 
player for his four years, is look(Continued from Page 6)
Last Friday. W & J defeated 
Tech. 512-31/2. in the final match 
of the year. Sam Janis was low 
score winner at 74 and gained IV2 
points. He and Malley each gain
ed a point in match play. The 
best-ball team of Malley and 
Smith won a point, while Janis 
and Wiegand gained one-half a 
piece.
The teams 2-7-1 record was not 
as disappointing as it may appear 
for many reasons. Coach Rodgers 
classified this as a rebuilding year 
because the top three golfers 
graduated last year. Lack of col
legiate experience by the new 
comers was evident at the begin
ning of the season. However, as 
the year progressed, play was 
much improved. Considering the 
number of one point defeats, a 
few breaks could have made this 
seasons record a duplicate of last 
years 5-4-1.
Senior Randy Borden has com
pleted his fourth year on the team 
and was its captain and most val
uable player. His absence will obvioulsy hurt the team, but the out
look for next year is still very 
promising. The rest of the top six 
players on the squad will return. 
With the invaluable experience 
that they gained this year, it ap
pears that these players will lead 
CMU to a winning season.

ing for his 19th straight win in 
singles. Lowe and Smolens are un
defeated for three years as a dou
bles team, playing both first and 
second doubles, and are looking 
for their 19th straight victory. 
Wahedi, a freshman, is trying to 
round out the season with a 10-0 
singles record to go with Khans 
undefeated mark, while Lowe and 
Smolens each have an 8-1 record 
in singles, with Hicken being 7-2. 
As mentioned before, the netters 
have a three year undefeated 
string at home, which they hope 
to extend against Pitt.
The tennis team would like to 
extend its sincere thanks to Coach 
Dave Lichtman.

to Carnegie as a professor of de
sign, bringing with him an intense 
love for authentic folk music. 
Hopihg to bring good folk music 
to the campus and to provide an 
opportunity for folk enthusiasts 
in the college community to get 
together to perform and share 
their interest in the idiom with 
each other. Prof. Glasser founded 
Ceilidh. The name (fronounced 
kay-lee) is an old Scot-Gaelic 
word which expresses the idea 
Prof. Glaser had in mind: it means 
an informal gathering or party, 
as held in the Scottish highlands, 
where the people that come are 
expected to help in making the 
music and general merriment.
Coming at the height of the 
folk craze. Ceilidh enjoyed im
mediate success. Prof. Glassers 
intention was for Ceilidh to pro
mote authentic folk music, rejec
ting the commercialized forms 
that were then popular, fleeting 
on Friday nights. Ceilidh attract
ed enthusiasts from all over Pitts
burgh as well as from this campus. 
Every week, the Wherret Room 
was filled with the sounds of all 
kinds of music, from Bluegrass 
to Appalacian, from ballads of the 
American South to those of the 
British Isles and Europe.
Besides the Friday night ses
sions, Ceilidh has sponsored year
ly concerts which have brought to 
campus such names in folk music 
as Pete Seeger, Doc Watson, Scot
tish folksinger Arthur Argo, 
Dwayne Thorpe. Vivian Richman, Bob Schmertz. Mac Martin 
and the Dixie Travelers, Fran 
Vandivier, Myra Elmers, Jerry 
Rassmussen, and Luke Faust. 
Twice the U. S. Information 
Agency has broadcast Ceilidh con
certs throughout the world over 
the Voice of America Network.
Ceilidhs reputation has spread 
by word of mouth throughout the 
country, and Prof. Glasser has re
ceived many letters from all over 
expressing interest in the organi
zation. Often, folk singers who 
have happened to be in town have 
dropped in on a Friday night ses
sion and played without pay.
hor the last seven years Ceil
idh has continued to be immen
sely popular and has served as 
the focal point for folk music in 
this city. Although the nationwide 
fad for folk music has passed, a 
hardcore of sincere enthusiasts 
has perpetuated good folk music 
at Carnegie
This fall, however. Prof.Glasser 
is leaving CMU for the Univer
sity of Rhode Island, leaving Ceil
idh without its most important ad
visor and supporter. Prof Glaser 
expressed to the TARTAN the 
hope that a successor from the 
faculty can be found who shares 
his devotion to authentic folk mu
sic and who can take over the 
responsibility of presiding over 
the weekly sessions and the organ
ization of the concerts. Such a
person is needed if Ceilidh Is to 
remain alive and active
Over the years. Prof Glasser has 
collected an extensive library of 
tapes of Cilidh concerts and week
ly gatherings. Starting next fall, 
the tapes will be available for 
listening in the Hunt Library. 
Prof .Glasser hopes that what Ceil
idh has done for the last seven 
years may be thereby preserved 
and serve as a permanent source 
of unspoiled folk art for this cam
pus.
Prof. Glasser fears that the fu
ture of Ceilidh is uncertain Mo
dern interests have shifted away 
from authentic folk music, and in 
order for his unique organization 
to survive it will need another 
leader who, like himself, would 
take the job out of sheer love for 
the art form. Prof. Glaser is hope
ful that another member of the 
faculty or staff will serve in his 
place next year and help insure 
the survival of a group which has 
spread the reputation of Carnegie 
as a center for good folk music 
throughout Pittsburgh and far 
away, as well.
Would you like to meet new 
friends? The Campus Y is plan
ning a program of guides for new 
overseas students. Volunteer stu
dents who have been at CMU at 
least one year are being sought. 
They may be overseas or Amer
ican, graduate or undergraduate, 
and should be returning to CMU 
next fall. Fluence in a language 
other than English is not required 
but is helpful.
Each guide who volunteers now 
will be assigned one or more over
seas students who have been ac
cepted for entering. CMU in the 
fall semester. Those who volun
teer for this program who may be 
around Pittsburgh during the sum
mer or early September might be 
called upon to meet at that time 
students at the airport, train or 
bus stations or when they arrive 
at CMU, help them to find their 
housing, answer their questions 
about living in Pittsburgh and 
about American customs with 
which they may be unfamiliar.
They could then introduce the 
new student to his or her special 
guide if he returns to CMU after 
the new student arrives
It would be up to each guide 
to find his own best way of help
ing the new student to whom he 
is assigned. Some helpful sugges
tions will be given during a short 
meeting which will be held on 
Friday, May 17, at 4:00 p.m. in 
Rm. 55, Skibo.
Each guide will be sent the 
name of his student during the 
summer if that is possible so he 
may get in correspondence before 
they meet in Pittsburgh.
Those interested in being a 
guide are invited to fill in appli
cations at Rm. 57, Skibo. The 
applications can also be found 
at various places around campus, 
or applicants can contact Krishnabadi Si Pribadi at 681-7165 or 
621-1100, ext. 315.
