Beta Sigma Rho House Burns 
Leaving 17 Men Homeless
Seventeen members of Beta Sigma Rho were left without clothes, books, and 
a place to eat and sleep when their old fraternity house on Morewood Avenue 
caught fire and burned for almost two hours last Tuesday afternoon.
The fire, which started about 3:00 p.m. on the south (or rear) side of the 
house, found five brothers in or around the house. One, Steve Berman, was 
asleep upstairs and was awakened by the fire alarm, and another, Sandy Sharp, 
had to climb out a rear window and jump from the rear porch roof to escape. 
The housemother, Mrs. Rose Karp, was out shopping when the blaze broke out.

Veteran Scholarships
A new G.I. Bill recently pass
ed by Congress provides financial 
assistance for military veterans 
now attending college.
To be eligible for benefits un
der this bill one must have ser
ved continuously at least 181 days 
on active duty, any part of which 
was after January 31, 1955 and 
must have an honorable discharge.
Application forms for aid are 
available in the office of Mr, Les
lie Thomas, Assistant Director of 
Evening School, Baker Hall 133,
trol the fire with hand extinguish
ers failed, but the men did ma
nage to get the Beta Sig sweep
stakes buggy out of the basement 
before the fire department ar
rived.
In Every Room
City of Pittsburgh firemen had 
the fire almost completely smo
thered by 5U5 p.m., but not be
fore flames had swept into every 
room in the house and left about 
one-fourth of the dwelling a total 
loss. A large crowd of Carnegie 
Tech students watched from More
wood Avenue and adjoining dorms 
and houses, and early spectators 
on the scene helped the fire fight
ers carry hose up the steep lawn 
in front of Beta Sig.
Cause Uncertain 
At the time of this writing the 
Citys Bomb and Arson Squad, 
which routinely investigates all 
major fires, was still carrying 
on investigations, which were ex
pected to take atout a week. Per
sonnel from the fire department 
did say, however, that they did 
not believe faulty gas or electric 
utilities could have beenthe cause.
A Fire Inspectors Report which 
passed through the hands of R.D, 
Strathmeyer, vice president of 
business affairs, less than a week 
before the blaze revealed no ex
ceptions to fire safety regulations 
at the Beta Sig house, although it 
did comment on the general slop
piness of housekeeping in the entire 
fraternity area.
Three Previous Fires 
Last semester Beta Sigma Rho 
was hit by three minor fires. Af
ter the last one, which occurred 
just before finals In January, a 
round-the-clock guard by Cam
pus Security Police was posted 
at the house until semester break. 
Since then special attention has 
been paid to the danger of fire in 
all the older buildings on campus, 
according to Mr, Strathmeyer and 
Earle R, Swank, Dean of Men, 
Salvage crews did not enter the 
house until two days after last 
Tuesdays fire. Although less than 
half of the houses contents actual
ly burned up, most of the rest of 
the clothing and furniture was 
ruined by smoke, heat, and wat
er.
Tuesday evening found the se
venteen brothers who had lived 
in the house left with literally 
nothing, and the loss of eating fa
cilities affected all the Beta Sigs. 
They ate supper at various frater
nity houses and at Morewood ca
feteria, and spent the night in 
friends apartments, dorm rooms, 
or fraternity houses with vacan
cies.

Sound Off
Nouveau
The obvious enthusiasm of the members of the cast of Nouveau is 
sufficient to compensate for most of the deficiencies of the production. 
A bubbling vitality pervades the show and dominates the atmosphere 
through the entire first act.
The play centers about a struggling artist, Sandy, who is competent
ly played by Bill Law. Sandy is a great artist or could be one, as he tells 
us in a clever song, Ability. But Sandy doesnt work hard enough be
cause his goals arent high enough, or they are too high, or something. 
This is one of the problems in the play: Sandys personality is never 
made clear.
One of Sandys biggest problems is his nagging mother, played in very 
believable fashion by Lenore Englemann. Her lines are typical and 
are delivered in suitable manner.
Sandys girl-chasing father, on the other hand, is almost entirely 
believable. His lines never seem quite right and in delivery and ap
pearance John Sweeny is more suggestive of Sandys son than his fa
ther. They could at least have grayed his hair.
Gina Valletta and Bill Burdett play a married couple, Irma and Da
mon, friends of Sandys, Gina, especially, has an enormous amount of 
enthusiasm, and both Gina and Burdett turn in quite acceptable perfor
mances.
Terry Miller, as Connie, Sandy's girlfriend, nearly steals the show. 
Though struggling at times with rather silly dialogue, Terry accomplish
es what the other members of the cast do not. She succeeds in immer
sing herself completely in her role. Her acting is very good and her 
singing even better.
His three friends convince Sandy that he should try painting in his 
sleep  an artist needs a gimmick. His first attempt is absolutely 
atrocious (I thought I knew ugly) but a financial success. For he 
is adopted by Becky Smith, playing to the hilt the part of a wealthy 
patron of the arts. Unfortunately, this brief narration constitutes near
ly all of the plot, so the play begins to lose direction in the second act.
Two minor flaws may well be corrected by this time. Opening night 
jitters took their toll in flubbed lines. And at times it seemed that either 
quieter musicians or noisier singers were needed.
On the plus side, and Nouveau does have much to recommend it, the 
big production numbers, especially TTieres a New Day, were very 
well done. Lawrence Stephens, Larry Miller, and Iris Ratner deserve 
commendations for their ingenuity. Also very ingenious, probably the 
funniest moment in the play, was the dramatic reading of Excel
sior, reminiscent of the poetry readings on the Rocky and Bullwinkle 
Show.
Realizing that a college production cannot be as professional as a 
Broadway show, I offer my congratulations to the cast and production 
staff.

Festive Carnival Weekend
Relaxation From Study
The gay festivities of Spring Carnival 66 will be
gin at 4:30 tomorrow when the Ithacas motivate 
movement on the Carnival Midway in Skibo parking

fatigue plus the Morewood curfews will bring the week
end to a climatic close.
In addition to the four main 
attractions - the New Christy Min

other enjoyable but less herald

be honored at Call Day at 1:30 
Friday on the Fine Arts lawn. 
This is the only time during the 
school year when students bestow 
honors upon other students for 
their participation in campus ac
tivities.
At 2:30 on Friday, students will 
be torn between the faculty egg 
toss on the mall and the talent 
jamboree in Skibo. The former 
will exhibit the skills of pro
pelling and carefully catching a 
raw chicken egg over a distance 
of usually 200 feet, while the lat

Editorial
Achievement Praised
The achievements of H. Russell Bintzer, who recently resigned 
from his position of Vice-President for Development to accept a si
milar position at Caltech, have been many, and the results have radi
cally altered the utility and appearance of the Tech Campus. How
ever, to most Tech students, these have been taken for granted, with 
the possible exception of the new Administration Hall currently under 
construction. Yet for many members of the faculty and administra
tion who have been at Tech since 1957, the current development program 
has been a marked success. 'Since that time the value of the physical 
plant at Tech has more than doubled, from 20.5 million in 1957 to nearly 
42.5 million in 1965. This is evident in the long list of buildings and im
provements made in this eight-year period, including the Hunt Library, 
Scaife Hall, the Studio Theatre, Hamerschlag Hall, Doherty Graduate 
House, four fraternity duplexes, Sldbo, the new athletic field, the level
ing of the cut, and additions to Morewood, Margaret Morrison, Porter 
Hall, and Mudge. In ad'li ion to these accomplishments money has 
been raised for the new administration Hall, in addition to two million 
dollars for the proposed new research center, and five million has 
been given for a new computer sciences building.
Since 1957 faculty salaries have increased an average of 70%, and 
the amount raised for this rise in salaries and student aid has totaled 
16 million, most of which has come from the development fund.
In his nine years at Tech, Bintzer has not only raised the funds 
for these buildings and other items of development, but also has boost
ed the total value of endowment and the physical plant from $66. 
million to 120 million.
In the booklet produced by the Development Committee just prior 
to the beginning of the 1957-1967 development program, the goals of 
the program were summed up in part by the following statement: 
The Board of Trustees, the administration, and the faculty of Car
negie Institute of Technology . .. recognize that physically, academi
cally, and spiritually it is impossible for a university to mark time 
or it will lose its place. It must constantly seek new frontiers of growth 
and challenge. They have set the stage with both insight and foresight. 
They are keenly aware of the responsibility of receiving which this 
undertaking entails. They are dedicated to preserving the enduring 
quality of usefulness of Carnegie Institute of Technology." Certainly
H. Russell Bintzer has been instrumental in achieving this goal for 
Tech. He is deserving of our greatest thanks, and the Tartan extends 
to him its best wishes for his future at Caltech.
Grad Deferment Confused; 
Conflicting Reports Heard
Recent releases from the Washington Selective 
Service Headquarters and the United States Council 
of Graduate Schools have again confused selective 
service deferment eligibility for graduate students 
already in residence.
Colonel Prosser of the Selective 
Service Headquarters informed 
Carnegie Tech on April 15 that 
graduate students would have de
ferment eligibility so long as they 
were making acceptable progress 
within the time limit of their pro
gram. This was to replace the 
requirement that the graduate stu
dent be in the top quarter of his 
class or score above 80 on the 
Qualification Test.
However, the Council of Grad
uate Schools has released a bulle
tin based on recent information in
dicating that some local boards 
may insist that the graduate stu
dent score an 80 on the test or 
show proof of ranking in the top 
quarter of his graduating class.
This release further implies that 
the make-up test scheduled for 
June 24 came about as a result 
of the fact that so few graduate 
udents registered for the test.
The bulletin from the Council 
has been posted at Mudge House, 
on departmental bulletin boards, 
and in the Information File in 
the Hunt Library.

Troika
In a recent column, we com
mented on the advantages of liv
ing and playing in Oakland, and 
continuing our tradition of re
porting in depth we present the 
following interview with Rusty 
Bell, exotic dancer. Rusty strips 
on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday 
at the MSG Lounge (Forbes at 
Atwood) which also features Gene 
and Jeannie, a fine Rock n Roll 
combo.
Troika: How should we refer to 
you  as an exotic dancer or a 
stripper?
Rusty: Exotic dancer, strip
per  same thing. It's when they 
use the expression belly dancer 
that I change the meaning.
Troika: How did you get start
ed in the business?
Rusty: Slightly by accident, real
ly. I was working as a secretary 
at Kaufmanns when I was 18, and 
one girl asked me to fill in for 
her one day; and I worked for her 
that weekend, and then it started.
Troika: How did you choose your
name?
Rusty: When I first started I 
was known as Lolita; but when I 
started getting past the Lolita 
stage, I had to come up with some
thing and at the time they had the 
name Rusty Bell so I picked that 
up. Its better than Silver Bells.
Troika: Who do you pattern your 
style after?
Rusty: The one I really like is 
Sally Rand. In my opinion, if she 
can keep her figure that well at 60, 
can you imagine what she looked 
like when she was younger. If I 
could do the same ... Id just 
like to be good enough that a guy 
would just care about me. I dont 
want to run around. My style is 
natural. Its my impersonation of 
an exotic dancer.
Troika: What are the occupa
tional hazards?
Rusty: I just keep to myself 
when I come to the shows, and I 
dont bother with any of the others. 
Loudmouths I ignore.
Troika: What do you think of 
Pittsburgh men  college men in 
particular?
Rusty: College boys are pretty 
young for me and Pittsburgh men 
are (shrug).
Troika: How do women react to 
your routine?
Rusty: In some places they are 
very catty, but they seem to be aw
fully nice here in Pittsburgh. In 
fact they are sometimes so warm 
and friendly, it worries me.
Troika: What do you mean?
Rusty: You know what I mean.
Troika: After working in night 
clubs and meeting many types of 
people, have you evolved any con
clusions about the human condi
tion?
Rusty: I dont think I should 
give my own philosophy on life 
because it is extremely suicidal. 
As far as different people that Pve 
met go, they are pretty nice. But 
there are a lot of people whose
By John Day 
Don Carter 
David Henderson
personalities change when they go 
into a club so that they are not 
the same as when you meet them 
on the street; they may really be 
all right. A lot of husbands do a 
lot of things they wouldnt nor
mally do. The same for wives.
Troika: Do you enjoy your work?
Rusty: No, I dont.
Troika: What do you like best 
about the business?
Rusty: I like money most. The 
thing I like least is constantly 
doing late shows and never hav
ing any time for myself. Now I 
work through an agency, and I 
work two nights a week, but I 
make more money.
Troika: Whats in the future for 
you, Rusty?
Rusty: I hope to find a man 
who will forget about my career 
and just like me, and then well 
settle down.
Troika: Do you want a family?
Rusty: Ive already got two chil
dren so well have to start with 
two.
Troika: Do you have other inte
rests?
Rusty: Yes, I won a scholar
ship to an art school, but I hate 
to get up at 6:00 in the morning 
so I didnt go.
Troika: What was your most 
embarrassing moment on the 
stage?
Rusty: When my G-string broke, 
but I wasnt embarrassed.
Troika: What advice do you give 
to any girl interested in becom
ing a stripper?
Rusty: Forget it.

Readers Write
It Misrepresents 
MG Counselors
Editor, the Tartan:
In the article entitled Morewood Selects Floor Counselors, 
April 27, we feel a portion of the 
selection process of next years 
counselors and the duties of this f 
years counselors have been mis
represented.
The article states that three 
agencies evaluated applicants: 
Morewood Gardens staff mem
bers, present dormitory counse
lors, and herself (Dean Milli
gan.) (The information was ob
tained during an interview with 
the dean Ed.)
In fact, the only student eval- f 
uation came from four AWS offi
cers and a casual luncheon con
versation with three present floor 
counselors. Some applicants were 
interviewed in groups of three to 
six by two AWS officers, while 
others rifever had an interview.
A Farce 
These interviews were unstruc
tured and proved that AWS offi
cers who had not been floor coun- i 
selors were unqualified to inter
view applicants for this position. 
Because two of the AWS offi
cers felt the interviews were such 
a farce, they took it upon themsel
ves to have several floor counse
lors evaluate applicants from their 
floors.
Twenty-six out of the thirty - 
one present floor counselors were 
never asked to evaluate appli- < 
cants. Head floors counselors 
were not asked to write recom
mendations for girls applying for 
second year positions. We feel 
that counselor opinions would have 
been most valuable because of their 
past experiences and association 
with the applicants.
Also, It has been suggested 
that the Administration and the 
women disagreed on a definition 
of the term and the function of 
floor counselors. Apparently, they 
still disagree on the meaning of 
Mrs. Milligans statement that 
floor counselors should serve as 
communications center, not as 
counselors.
Solving Problems 
Dean Milligan has stated that, 
first semester girls didnt get 
the idea that they were not to coun
sel. However, floor counselors 
this year were appointed and train
ed with the idea that they would at
tempt with their head counselors to 
solve any problems which might 
arise before passing the problem 
on to the Administration.
Present floor counselors have 
found that a small percentage of 
their time is spent as communi
cation centers  passing on in
formation from AWS, clarifying 
rules and regulations, and for
warding information from the 
floors to the resident staff and 
Dean of Womens office.
Most of the counselors time is 
spent advising the lovelorn; date 
hunting; academic tutoring; lis
tening to roommate differences, 
personality gripes, and family pro
blems; dispensing aspirin and 
bandaids; providing a strong shoul
der on which to cry; and, in gene  
ral, playing Den Mother. A good 
floor counselor must learn to be 
versatile; she must be able to as
sume each of these roles any hour 
of the day or night.
Good Den Mothers 
A good Den Mother is trusted 
by the girls and is capable of 
helping them work out their pro
blems of growing up. Under
classmen often bring their pro
blems to her because they respect 
her opinion as a peer. Her matu
rity helps her spot problems and 
seek advice when she cant handle 
a situation. But often she is the 
only person who can effectively 
deal with the student.
We have found that the present 
role of the floor counselor is a 
valuable experience for both counContinued on Page 5

Walters Speaks 
On Preservation 
Through Freezing
Forrest Walters, direc
tor of Continuelife Corpo
ration in Latrobe, Pa.,will 
address the Carnegie Tech 
all - school assembly on 
May 10 in the Wherrett 
Room at 11:30 a.m. on the 
prospect of immortality.
Continuelife Corporation and 
such groups as Life Extension 
Society are concerned with the 
possibility of preserving human 
beings by freezing and subsequent 
ranimation.
Recent advances in low-temperature biology indicate the pos
sibility of freezing the body im
mediately after death so that it 
may be stored, without further 
deterioration, until medical sci
ence has advanced to a sufficient 
degree to eliminate the cause of 
death or repair the body, which 
could then carefully be thawed back 
to life.
Walters has discussed this top
ic on WIIC TV, KDKA, and WRYT 
radio, and will entertain questions 
after his talk at Carnegie Tech.

Flag Deserves 
Proper Care
Editor, the Tartan:
We are distressed that dur
ing the past month of rainy wea
ther the American flag has re
mained flying. According to Pub
lic Law 829, Section 2c The flag 
should not be displayed on days 
when the weather is inclement. 
The school has the obligation to 
give the flag its proper care. We 
realize that it is difficult to take 
the flag down for every five min
ute shower, but there is no ex
cuse for the flag to remain fly
ing through a three-hour down
pour.

Correction
A recent Tartan article incor
rectly said that Bernard H. Judd, 
newly appointed assistant pro
fessor of English, was a candi
date for a doctorate of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin. Professor 
Judd received his doctorate this

Beta Sig Firecontinued from Page 1 
ters. Mrs. H. Guyford Stever call
ed to invite fire victims to the 
presidents home as soon as she 
heard of the fire. The Pittsburgh 
chapter of the American Red Cross 
volunteered aid.
In a special meeting at next-door 
Sigma Nu at 5 p.m. Tuesday, at
tended by all members of Beta 
Sigma Rho as well as CFP repre
sentatives, Dean Swank checked 
to see that all were safely out of 
the still-smouldering house and 
then announced that he was setting 
up an emergency loan fund in his 
office the next day. He also pro
mised to secure minimal busi
ness and social space for the Be
ta Sigs for the remainder of the 
school year.
Brothers were also urged to find 
out if their personal losses, which 
were very heavy in some cases, 
were covered by insurance. Car
negie Tech owns the Beta Sigma 
Rho building itself, and the fra
ternity reportedly has some in
surance on house furniture and 
fixtures.
Dean Swank and Edward R. 
Schatz, Vice President for Aca
demic Affairs, are drafting a me
mo, to be issued tomorrow, ask
ing instructors to give affected 
students extra time to make up 
missed work, and appropriate con
sideration concerning papers and 
projects lost in the fire.
No Housing Plans
Most of the evacuated men are 
now living in dormitories, es
pecially Welch and Donner Halls, 
and apartments. The housemoth
er has been put up in Morewood 
Gardens. No communal housing ar
rangement for next year has been 
decided upon yet.
Cadets Awarded

have won two - year full-tuition 
scholarships from the Department 
of the Army. Robert Hubbard, me
chanical engineering, Terence 
Lunghofer, chemistry and Leigh

were awarded the scholarships 
for their high scholastic achie
vements and their demonstrat

Tartan Sports Editor
For the last couple of weeks, Tech students were witnessing some
thing which to most of them was quite unfamiliar  Spring Football 
Practice. This was the first time in three years that Tech has had 
Spring practice, and, if all indications are correct, it could prove to 
be a big factor in building a winning Tech team.
Twenty-nine players competed in the final squad game last Satur
day. These players, said Coach Joe Gasperella, will provide a 
strong nucleus for next years team. Im looking forward to a much 
bigger squad and a much better season next year.
Dave Gilchrist and Jim Huckleberry, veterans of two years ago, 
have returned to the Tartan squad after a years absence. These two 
players, along with two or three new Freshman and Sophomore pros
pects, can add much depth to an already strong Tartan team. With 
these players and a good response from the freshman, we will have 
much more depth next year than we have had in the past, said Coach 
Gasparella. As Bill Patulla, the Tartans Guard said, If we get some 
good freshman to provide the depth and replace Coleman and Merrill, 
we should be in much better position next year. Hubka looked real 
good in practice and if his knee holds out and we get the depth, well 
be able to win many of those games that we lost in the last quarter 
next season.
The attitude among the players was a good one. They were glad to be 
able to find their weak points now so that they could practice them over 
the summer. Perhaps this high spirit among the players was best ex
pressed by Larry Getto, Tartan Halfback, when he said, Im looking 
forward to a good year and a good team that will win a lot more gam
es, if not all of them.
I think that Spring Practice was an excellent idea and one that could 
lead the Tartans back to the winning ways. I feel that Coach Gasparella 
is to be congratulated on reviving this training and I, along with the rest 
of the student body, wish him and his team the best of luck in next years 
season.
while Jim won the 440 yd. inter
mediate hurdles and took second 
in the 120 yd. high hurdles; both 
ran on the winning 440 relay team. 
Only 1/4 point behind the leaders 
was George Schuessler who pla
ced first in the discus, second 
in the triple jump, and third in 
the shot put. Techs only double 
winners were Cris Macosko and 
Harry Burkholder who tied for 
first place in the 880 yd. run 
and again shared first place, this 
time along with Roger Cairns, 
in the mile run.
Tech coach Ed Vamos said that 
he feels the team is doing a great 
job despite the injuries and 
sickness the team has suffered 
from. At the present, Denny Col
lins and Jeff Sheldon are out of the 
top line-up and on the sick list. 
Coach Vamos especially says the 
field men have come a long way 
and he was quoted as saying 
Weve got the best field men 
this year that weve had since 
I came to Tech.
Today, the Tartans travel to Be
thany in their first away meet 
of the year.

Grove City
by George Smith
After opening the week with a
4-3 loss at the hands of Geneva, 
the Tartan Golf Team concluded 
their week schedule on a victori
ous note by downing Grove City,
5-1/2 to 3-1/2.
The match at Geneva was neck 
and neck all the way until the Tar
tans dropped medalist point to lose 
by a single point. In the meet 
against Grove City, which was on
ly the second home meet of the 
year, the Tartans completely mas
tered their opponents for an im
pressive win. The victory raised 
the Tartans record to 3-4.
Bill Grugler continued to be the 
big point getter for the Tartans 
as he accumulated 11 ofthe 31-1/2

year. Brugler has yet to be beat
en in competition.
The Tartans next home match 
will be against W&J next Tuesday

nis was dropped as an activity, 
in accordance with W.A.A. rules; 
however, Chatham requested a

that certain students did have in
