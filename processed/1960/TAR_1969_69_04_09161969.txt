Faculty Petition Supports Black Coalition 
Stever Issues Statement of Policy
by ERICA BORDEN
President H. Guyford Stever 
lost an important Opportunity 
to become a moral leader of the 
community Friday when he fail
ed to issue a strong statement in 
support of the Black Construc
tion Coalition.
Friday afternoon, September 12, 
a petition signed by 124 faculty 
members was submitted to Dr. 
Stever recommending the dis
continuation of construction on 
the new science building as of 
Monday morning, September 15, 
Black Monday. The petition fur
ther recommended that con
struction should not recommence 
until the conflict between the 
Black Coalition and the Mas
ter Builders and relevent unions 
is satisfactorily resolved.
Many individual faculty and 
students at Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity will undoubtedly support 
the Black Coalition by marching 
on Monday, the petition read. 
But we believe Carnegie-Mel
lon University as an institu
tion could serve a constructive 
role if you as President were to 
take concrete action indicating 
institutional support for Black 
Coalition. While we recognize 
that the primary responsibility 
of our institution is to foster the 
education of our students and ex
pand the frontiers of knowledge, 
we also agree with your often 
stated position that as an institu
tion we have a responsibility to 
the community.
Circulation of the petition 
was limited to Thursday after
noon. Time, therefore, prevented 
many departments from being 
contacted. Those departments, 
however, which were reached in
cluded history, English, mechani
cal engineering, statistics, mod
ern languages, physics, psy
chology and GSIA. The high
est responses came from his
tory, english, psychology and 
GSIA.
As a result of the petition and 
the crisis atmosphere surround
ing the issue, President Stever 
met Friday with the Policy Ad
visory Board of the University.
Dr. Loiselle listens attentively to students questions.
Age or Generation Gap?
by MURRAY SINGER
Dr. Loiselle, on the staffs of 
Western Psychiatric Institute and 
Clinic, and the Pitt Medical 
School, is a specialist in com
munity mental health.
Coming away from last Thurs
days lunchtime forum, I was
somewhat confused as to the pur
pose of these meetings. Although 
the talk given by Dr. Robert 
Loiselle and the ensuing discus
sion were quite interesting, they 
did not present the type of novel 
information which can help one 
better understand a problem. 
The hour, in fact, did not even
Famous Newscaster 
Addresses Assembly
On Tuesday, September 23 at 
11:30, Sander Vanocur, a well 
known columnist and news re
porter will present the first in a 
series of lectures sponsored by 
the Activities Council of CMU.
Mr. Vanocur, an experienced 
newscaster for NBC, covered 
the 1968 National Political Con
ventions and was on the scene 
when Senator Robert Kennedy 
was shot and fatally wounded af
ter winning the California primary. 
He has closely followed the Ken
nedy family, and has just com
pleted a book, co-edited with Pi
erre Salinger, A Tribute to John
F. Kennedy.
He has received a number 
of awards for his work. Among 
them are a merti award from 
Northwestern University and 
a broadcasting Award from 
Yale Broadcasting Company. He 
has also been recognized in the 
Congressional Record for his 
exclusive interview with Tran 
Hoai Nam, a high official of the 
National Liberation Front, the 
political arm of the Viet Cong.
Along with Mr. Vanocur, in 
future lectures, the Activities 
Council will have lined up Ar

Strom Thurmond, William Moor
head and a number of others.
expose me to the views of those 
who dwell on the other side of 
the generation gap, since Dr. 
Loiselle himself appeared very 
sympathetic toward the values 
associated with student youth of 
today.
One point which was made by 
Dr. Loiselle is that the gap 
in question may not be as inher
ently due to age difference as is 
generally assumed. He cited a 
study which showed a positive 
relationship between ones toler
ance of others and the level of 
ones education. It would seem, 
however, that it is not only the 
extent of ones education but also 
the nature of it and is relevant 
here. Certainly, it is clear that 
dissent among the student popu
lation is more closely associated 
with other schools of social 
sciences, for example, than with 
professional faculties.
Dr. Loiselles primary thesis 
was that even ignoring the dif
ferences in educational oppor
tunity, our parents were raised in 
a world which was essentially 
dissimiar to our own. Most of 
those born prior to World War II 
became children of the work ethic,
The Board is comprised of Dr. 
Stever, the Deans and VicePresidents of the University, 
Joe Durkworth, Student Gov
ernment President, and Patrick 
Cavanagh, Chairman of Student 
Senate. The Board discussed what 
action should be taken on the is
sues raised by the petition. Presi
dent Stever rejected the recom
mendation that the construction 
sites be closed as it would con
stitute a political action on the 
part of the University.
In face of criticism that keep
ing the construction open was just 
as strong a political action in sup
port of the unions, Stever replied 
that C-MU could not legitimately 
condemn the construction unions 
hiring policies when C-MUs were 
equally questionable.
Among other considerations 
were the fact that the Black Coali
tion had not requested a shut 
down and that the cost of halt
ing construction could possibly 
amount to $25,000 a day. Stever 
then appointed a committee to 
draft a statement which he would 
consider issuing.
Late Friday Dr. Stever received 
the document from the drafting 
committee that had been compos
ed of Richard Cyert, James Langer, Joe Duckworth and Edward 
Schatz. By Monday morning, 
however, he had still not issued a
citizens torn apart by either con
tinuing social injustice or vio
lence.
The statement, in an effort 
to please all the members of the 
Higher Education Council, was 
bland and almost meaningless.
On Monday afternoon, Dr. Stev
er issued a statement in reply to 
the faculty petition. (Text on page 
two.)
Background
In the early sixties concern 
grew about discriminatory prac
tices in trade unions. As a result, 
the State Human Relations Com
mission was put in charge of an 
investigation into the unions mem
bership practices. They attempted 
to get a document from unions 
and labor organizations which, in 
essence, would assure the Com
mission that there were no dis
criminatory practices in hiring 
and membership. The Master 
Buildersn and unions gradually 
became less compliant about sub
mitting the required evidence. 
In fact, some unions have not sub
mitted records for over two 
years.
The organizations were es
tablished in Pittsburgh to be in
volved in occupational training 
so that people, mainly blacks, 
would be qualified for positions 
in many Pittsburgh industries. 
Unions and the master Buildstatement. At a meeting of the Pitts- ers Association agreed to co
burgh Council of Higher Educa
tion, comprised of the presidents 
of the six major city colleges, a 
statement was agreed upon which, 
in effect, said very little. The 
telegram, sent to both negotia
ting factions, mentioned deep 
concern that the city is being 
torn by a major disagreement on 
the part of the black workers and 
the construction industry. Fur
ther, it offered the assistance 
and expertise of faculties and staffs 
in an attempt to reach the earli
est possible solution to this prob
lem. In offering its assistance, 
the council added, we do not 
want our city and our fellow
operate with Operation Dig, the 
Bidwell Cultural and Training 
Center, and OIC, because at 
that time, the trainees were not 
well enough trained to threaten 
the present union membership. 
But when the time came that the 
trainees were more qualified, 
resistance from unions and the 
Master Builders became evident.
Because of the resistance and 
failure of these three organiza
tions to get real cooperation and 
committment from the Master 
Builders, they formed the Black 
Coalition with the intention of in{('mtmued <m Page 2)
C-MAP Head Speaks 
On "Firing Line
Dr. Norman Johnson, the new director of the Carnegie-Mellon 
Action Program (C-MAP), will appear on Firing Line this Friday, 
September 19, at 12:00 p.m. in the Skibo ballroom. Firing Line is 
a new program being sponsored by the YM-YWCA. In response to 
questions put to him by a student panel and by members of the au
dience, Dr. Johnson will spell out the philosophies and policies of 
C-MAP. At issue, of course, will be a housing policy presently in ef
fect for some of the C-MAP students.
Dr. Johnson holds an appointment in the School of Urban and Pub
lic Affairs at CMU as well as the director ship of C-MAP. His PhD 
is from Ohio State University. He has taught at the Pitt Graduate 
School of Social Work and has been research director of Community 
Action Pittsburgh.
Dr. Joynson will deal with the basic issues underlying efforts of 
predominately white institutions to the needs and desires of blacks in 
America. Although Dr. Johnson begins speaking at 12:00 noon, students 
are urged to attend when every they are free thereafter if they are un
able to make it at noon.

Memorandum To Faculty 
And Graduate Students
I appreciate the petition prompt
ed by the Pittsburgh labor prob
lem which about 125 faculty 
members have sent to me, and a 
somewhat similar one sent by 
about 30 graduate students. I un
derstand the thought and concern 
conveyed by these petitions.
As this problem came into fo
cus in recent weeks, we have re
viewed our policies and proce
dures on our building program. 
All of our construction projects 
are required to comply with fed
eral regulations about hiring prac
tices by contractors. On the pre
sent two projects, the ResearchComputer Building and the Fra
ternity Dormitory Complex, about 
ten per cent of the workers are 
black. I understand that the con
tractors on these projects meet 
federal employment practice 
standards. However, on the prob
lem of the individual craft unions, 
which is the nub of the argument, 
federal statements and federal 
agency actions have not satisfac
torily met the basic problem with
in some unions caused by their 
control of employment practices.
Two weeks ago at the request 
of the Mayor, who was concerned 
about public safety, we joined 
some other owners in shutting 
down construction for about three
days. However, in the light of all 
aspects of the present situation, 
we have decided not to close con
struction now as recommended by 
the petitions. We do not think that 
doing so would improve the cli
mate of negotiations now proceed
ing.
Since the University is and will 
be for a time engaged in construc
tion projects, and since questions 
of human rights have been raised 
in connection with the building in
dustry, we should seek effectual 
ways to ensure that the Universi
tys own actions do not impede 
the gaining of these rights and 
make every effort to contribute 
those skills and expertise which 
the personnel of the university 
possess toward advancing the op
portunities sought through cur
rent negotiations. After consulta
tion with the Policy Advisory 
Board, made up of representa
tives from several campus consti
tuencies of Carnegie-Mellon, I am 
appointing a study group to sug
gest procedures which will work 
toward the ends in question. In 
view of the immediacy of the ques
tion, I will ask the group for a re
port by October 1. The study 
group will be composed of three 
administrators, three faculty and 
three student representatives.
H. Guyford Stever
Generation Gap
(Continued from Page 1)
which asserted that, no matter 
how poorly off you were today, 
if you really plugged away that 
some day things would be swell. 
Growing up today, ignorant of 
whether twenty years from now 
we will be starting or choking in 
an atmosphere saturated with 
poisonous wastes (if indeed we 
are still around) all adds up to 
the factor which Dr. Loiselle 
referred to as Uncertainty. 
Ever since the atomic bombing of 
Hiroshima, it has become evident 
that man can easily destroy him
self in an ever-increasing number 
of ways.
The summed nuclear stockpiles 
of the world provide a TNT-equivalent of 15 tons for every living 
man, woman, and child; and, as 
Dr. Loiselle remarked, it just 
doesnt take that much. The very 
tentativeness of survival over the 
next thirty years seems to have 
had the effect of causing young 
people to become impatient, to 
refuse to delay the fulfillment of 
their own needs.
At this point I became lost in 
a jumble of questions which 
come to mind. If uncertainty 
leads to the desire to satisfy ones 
own needs as quickly as ppssible, why do we see the increased 
interest in the plight of others? 
What aspects of our upbringing 
have caused us to scorn the propoganda of our own societies, 
and to become immune to the 
smooth-talking commercial ad
vertisements to which we are ex
posed.
One member of the audience 
asked whether present day stu
dents had rejected the rational 
or logical process as a manner 
in which to approach their en
vironment, and I was relieved 
to hear Dr. Loiselle respond that 
it was quite doubtful that our 
youth perceives the older genera
tion as rational, reasonable. 
When Dean Rusk, as Dr. Loiselle 
pointed out, favors unilateral dis
armament (early I960) and sim
ultaneously supports the de
velopment of a nuclear stockpile 
so that we can disarm from a 
position of strength, there is a 
great question of who is or who is 
not being rational.
I was disappointed that Dr. 
Loiselle, who himself counsels 
students with emotional prob
lems, minimized the impor
tance of the increased need for 
identity in the question of the 
generation gap. It would seem 
to me that many unanswered 
questions might be solved by ex
amining the effects on personality 
of a threatening environment. In 
order to synthesize the mani
festations of the generation gap, 
and to understand the lack of com
munication, it seems necessary to 
compare the personalities of 
the groups in question and to
by black replacements. These and 
other considerations in the twoweek-old talks were narrowed 
down in the last few days of giveand - take bargaining appar
ently due to pressure of the plan
ned demonstration on Monday.
As cited in a statement issued 
by religious leaders from five 
denominations and the Council 
of Churches, Building contrac
tors and 24 skilled trade unions 
control the building industry in 
Pittsburgh. These 24 key unions 
have a membership of approxi
mately 27,000. Of that num
ber approximately 212 are black 
workers  less than 1 per cent.
In addition, the Teamsters 
and several laborers construc
tion unions together have a mem
bership of approximately 42,000. 
Black workers constitute 1759 
of their total  1359 of whom are 
laborers.
Since 1963 there has been no 
significant increase in the per
centage of black workers in Pitts
burghs building trade unions.
Black Monday
Black leaders of the Coalition 
called Black Monday to de
monstrate the community sup
port behind their drive to se
cure more black jobs in the con
struction industry.
Several hundred C-MU faculty 
and students were among the esti
mated 3,500 marchers on Black 
Monday.
The march, led by coalition 
leaders carrying black flags, pro
ceeded peacefully from Freedom 
Square towards the Point. Before 
the procession was mobilized, the 
crowd was briefed by coalition 
marshals that the demonstration 
was to be peaceful and non-violent 
and that those interested in other 
tactics should leave the line.
During the march, the goodhumored participants clapped 
hands and sang as interested and 
not-so-interested bystanders and 
shopowners watched. The down
town apartment and office build
ings resembled a Shakesperean 
theatre as hundreds of expression
less residents looked down upon 
the stage.
translate these into personal 
philosophies which would result, 
and which do conflict.
A large part of the discussion 
period was devoted to the ques
tions of drug use, and the rea
sons put forth for their prolif
eration ranged from the need for 
release from educational pres
sures, to a desire to reject not 
only the values but also the 
highs (tranquillizers, alcohol) 
of the establishment. Here again 
the participants seemed more in
terested in the manifestations of 
the problem of a generation gap 
than in the problem itself. De
spite this, the hour was stimula
ting, and I hope that there is a 
better turnout for this weeks dis
cussion of the problems of the 
draft.

5:30 Wednesday
Almost the entire Pittsburgh 
police force was present, although 
they were not called upon to keep 
order; coalition civilian marshals 
insured the good conduct of the 
crowd. The police were equipped 
with helmets, mace, billy clubs 
and guns.
The marchers proceeded to the 
construction site of the new US 
Steel building. The demonstrators 
surrounded the building, staring 
up at the white union workers, 
clapping hands, and shouting, 
We want union jobs!
The white laborers occassionally glanced down at the crowd, al
though many appeared to be try
ing to ignore the demonstration. 
One worker was seen dancing to 
the hand clapping; another spat 
down upon the crowd.
Dismond remarked as the crowd 
moved from the construction site 
to return to Freedom Square that 
if the Monday negotiations failed, 
there would be another demonstra
tion next Monday.
Coalition leaders were reluc
tant to describe exactly what 
form Black Monday would 
take. Safety Boss Cortese said 
Sunday that the decision not to 
reveal the route of the march 
made police responsibilities dif
ficult.
One of the most unique as
pects of the march is that, con
trary to many of last years de
monstrations which were organ
ized as violent confronta
tions, every effort was made to 
insure that Black Monday 
would remain peaceful. Thus, 
many otherwise alienated groups 
were encouraged to participate. 
White liberals who were turn
ed off by the radical movement 
joined in the march. Blacks 
who have been labeled Uncle 
Toms found a legitimate outlet 
to show their support. Business
men took a large part in the de
monstrations in an effort to break 
up the powerful unions. Black 
militants toned down the de
monstrations in order to keep 
the cross the line support and give 
strength to their activities.
Black Coalition
(Continued from Page AB 
vestigating union membership 
practices. During the investiga
tion they discovered open discrim
ination and statistics which 
had not been turned into the Hu
man Relations Commission and 
which indicated discrimination. 
Mike Dismond, Director of Bidwell, organized the first demon
stration on Tuesday, August 25. 
The Bidwell Corporation chose 
The Three Rivers Stadium as the 
picketing site because it was a 
public concern using public 
money and attracting much at
tention. The picketing aroused 
far more counter-violence from 
white workers than the Coalition 
anticipated. On Wednesday, 
Byrd Brown, Coalition spokes
man and local NAACP presi
dent, was arrested. Plans were 
made for a Thursday demonstra
tion but were halted because of 
the fear of more violence.
The crisis atmosphere moved 
Mayor Barr and a representa
tive of US Steel to meet with
Brown in his jail cell. They 
agreed to shut down US Steel 
to prevent further demonstrations.; 
The question of whether or not 
the workers will be paid for the 
days they were laid-off is still 
under negotiation.
Where we Are Now
As the negotiation session 
were not producing any visible 
results, Mr. Dismond announced 
a day of demonstration would be 
held Monday, September 15. 
There has been absolutely no 
progress, said the Rev. James 
J. Robinson last Monday.
Black Monday, Mr. Dismond 
said, would begin at 8 a.m. at 
Freedom Corner  Center Avenue 
and Crawford Street above the 
Civic Arena. The day of de
monstration would also include 
an attempt to boycott business in 
the downtown Pittsburgh area, and 
walkouts from schools and jobs, 
in an attempt to get stores and 
other institutions to bring pres
sure to bear on negotiations in 
favor of the Black Coalition.
Were going to ask the help 
and support' of all white people 
who see this as a just cause, 
he added.
Last Wednesday Night the 
white Friends of the Black 
Coalition began to organize 
and plan for Mondays march. 
The Rev. Robinson told a group 
of 200 whites who met at the 
University and Cities Minis
tries center that the Monday de
monstration would be primarily 
a march and that as of now, 
there is no plan to shut down 
job sites.
Negotiations
The Black Coalitions demands 
include a long term project (five 
years) for opening unions. They 
are asking for a package which 
guarantees entry into unions for 
qualified and trained people. 
The process by which the un
ion determines who is qualified 
and what the term of apprentice
ship should be is under considera
tion to determine whether the 
requirements are realistic.
The latest rejection to a bid to 
get more blacks into construc
tion unions came late Satur
day night. The Coalitions pro
posal which would put about 2500 
blacks into the unions and on 
construction jobs within three 
to five years was rejected be
cause of a need for further stu
dy
The union bargainers have sent 
a telegram to the national presi
dent of the Building and Con
struction Trades Council in Wash
ington urging that international 
representatives of each union in
volved be sent to Pittsburgh to 
attend the negotiating session 
1 p.m. on Monday.
Initially, the Coalition had as
ked for 40 per cent  or 12,000 
union membership, but had 
lowered that demand to 25 per 
cent before presenting the latest 
proposal.
Contractors and unions have 
upped their offer from 100 to
200 rotating training alots for 
Black persons to fill in the in
dustry until a certain percentage 
of industry jobs and union 
membership is filled by black 
people. As they become full 
fledged journeymen with union 
cards, their slots would be filled

Harrassment of Students 
What Will Happen Next?
Editor's Note: The following ar
ticle, 'written by George M. Lies, 
appeared in The Pitt News (Sep
tember Dr.L We are reprinting it 
to point to the seriousness of the 
security situation in the Oak
land area.
Life as a student at Pitt is 
not always a lot of good times.
Based in an urban environ
ment, Pitt comes into direct con
tact with persons outside the 
books bought for classes. In 
the past year, this direct con
tact has been increased  in the 
form of assaults on students, 
both male and female.
History has recorded many 
such incidents on campus, but 
an incident last Friday night af
ter a dance has sparked the stu
dent voice into asking for more 
security protection on campus.
No one has been seriously in
jured . . . yet. But it is literally 
unsafe for a beau and a girl to 
walk about the campus. Adminis
trators say something should be 
done.
According to Capt. Charles 
Ray, Superintendent of Secur
ity Forces, the security forces 
are being increased constantly as 
able men are available for re
cruitment and thus be around.
But the question asked Fri
day night  by about a dozen 
students  was: where was the 
protection when it was needed?
According to Captain Ray six 
persons were assaulted by a gang 
outside the Student Union Build
ing late Friday night.
He indicated that more people 
may have been harassed, but 
that there was no official report 
on them. He said two male stu
dents were taken to the hospi
tal; both were treated, but non 
admitted.
Ray said that two patrolmen 
were on duty inside the Un
ion for the dance that night. A 
normal patrol was on duty in the 
Towers, the Quadrangle, and 
about the campus, he said. He 
did not elaborate further.
The men in the building (Un
ion) were trying to clear the 
thing (dance), he says. Things 
happen like this. Its one of those 
things that spring up.
The incident probably eman
ated from outside the University, 
he said. "It can be duplicated 
again.
The underlying cause of these 
things is the open door policy 
around here. Everyones welcomed, 
he said.
However. Ray did say that 
very serious consideration 
by top administrators may help 
change this policy. A dif
ferent approach must be taken. 
The dorm is like a home, and 
not a public building. he added.
Theyre going to have to do 
something to keep these damn 
people (outsiders) out of build
ings. Screen these people out. 
The policy doesn't exist at this

There has to be a revision,

Capt. Ray agrees with the idea 
of the university-community in

wonderful, he said. "From 
my end of the stick, it's not work

Should Students Control 
Non-academic Affairs
by STEVE ROSENBERG
As many of you may be aware, the juke-box in Skibo charges a 
dime a selection, the same rate used in any commercial restaurant. 
Skibo. however, is not just any restaurant. It was not set up to make a 
profit, not even necessarily to break even, if this means restricting the 
scope of its facilities. It was set up to provide students with food, 
lounges and meeting rooms. The emphasis is on happy users not pro
fit. Given such a philosophy, it is absurd to charge a profit - making, 
commercial rate for the juke-box. A nickel a selection is the usual 
break-even point, and is what most student unions charge.
Although this may seem a rather minor complaint, it is sympto
matic of the way Skibo is run. That is, with Tittle consultation with 
students and little control by students of activities and facilities. Car
negie is one of the few major universities in the country where stu
dents have not won autonomy in student affairs. At most campuses it is 
the rule, rather than te exception for students through a strong stu
dents society to own and operate their own students center. Often 
the students society has, as well, the sole right to discipline stu
dents in non academic matters. In such cases the administration en
ters into an agreement whereby it merely collects and deposits with 
the students society students fees.
This is not a political issue but rather a question of the proper di
vision of authority and function of the three segments of the univer
sity  faculty, students, and administration. The function of faculty 
is research and teaching. That of the administration is admintering  
the idea being to free faculty and students for more productive pur
suits. Running student affairs, however, should not be part of the 
administrations duties. Rather, the non-academic affairs of students 
should be run by their peers.Only in this was can the students 
wishes be truely enacted and the outdated idea of in Loco Parentis 
be removed. In addition of course, it takes a burden off the shoulders 
of a presumably busy administration which should be concerned with 
more traditional matters.
It has been shown at countless campuses that students are com
petent enough to manage their own affairs. (It would be a sad com
mentary if college students werent considered qualified for such a 
simple task.) Why dont students run their own affairs here? One of 
the reasons is apathy. Most students dont give a damn about student 
affairs and government. In short, they dont care about the running of 
the things that most directly affect them as students. They dont care 
enough to organize a strong student boice to speak for them in course 
selection, hiring of new faculty, the direction the university is head
ing, etc. They dont care enough to set up an organization which will 
seek out and present their views when the (ecisions are made which 
most directly affect them. Its a pretty sad thing to think about the 
cogs being ground out here to fit the places society has decided they 
should go. For thinking people they evidently dont care to think 
about non-approved things, such as their lea ning and living environ
ment  C.M.U.

Revised Curriculum for C.I.T. 
Allows More Informed Choices
Behind the development in the 
College of Engineering and 
Science (Carnegie Institute of 
Technology) is a new and 
different curriculum unlike other 
engineering and science programs 
in the U.S. More than 500 engin
eering and science freshmen have 
the first real chance such stu
dents anywhere have ever had 
to make an informed career 
choice.
The new curriculum was ini
tiated this year following sev
eral years of study and prelim
inary trials with selected groups 
of students. It is designed to 
allow the students an early taste of 
professional courses, which can 
career selection, to provide en
gineering and science majors 
with much more flexibility in 
their choice of courses, and to 
eliminate that much talked about 
fifth year of high school.
Traditionally engineering and 
science freshmen throughout the 
U. S. are given a commonprogram consisting mostly of cour
ses in mathematics and basic 
science with some humanities 
and social science courses.
The high enthusiasm of most 
students entering the common 
freshmen curriculum runs down
hill beginning in November, 
says Richard A. Moore, profes
sor of mathematics and chair
man of the committee which 
recommended the changes. The 
tragedy is, he continues, that 
even in many good students the 
enthusiasm is not rekindled in 
their major programs. They 
come expecting college and get 
more high school, and the transi
tion to our high-flying major 
programs is never made in spirit, 
only in duty.
C-MUs new program intro
duces three electives plus a 
choice between two chemistry 
courses to first-year students 
and includes courses offered by 
the five engineering depart
ments. It is the first time mem
bers of the engineering depart
ments teach courses for first 
year students. Thus an engineer
ing student can take several cour
ses in an area of major inter
est in the freshmen year, or he 
can shop around if his interest 
is uncertain or diversified.
We hope that this kind of ap
proach, says Robert .v Carlin, 
associate dean of CIT, will con
tribute significantly to reducing 
the number of unwise selections 
of professions made by fresh
man and sophomores which cause 
problems later, either while 
the student is still in college, 
or in some cases for the rest of 
his professional life.
In addition to the engineer
ing electives, others will be of
fered by every department in 
CIT. Available courses will in
clude an experimental physics 
laboratory, a course on com
puter programming and problem 
solving, a session in adminis
tration and management sciences, 
and other electives in chemistry 
and mathematics. All of the elec
tives will be taught by members 
of the Senior faculty. One of the 
courses, for example, The Art 
of Engineering, will be offered 
by B. Richard Teare, Jr., former 
dean of CIT and now Univer
sity Professor of Engineering.
Another new aspect of the 
freshman program is the intro
duction of the joint mathetmatics - physics course, which 
was given last year as an ex
periment. The course is taught 
by senior members of the matthematics and physics faculties, 
both often present in the classroom 
at the same time. The presenta
tion is coordinated in almost a 
day-to-day manner and provides 
flexibility for the two faculty 
members involved to change 
pace, emphasis and to engage in 
ad hoc exploration.
Professor Moore taught the 
course in the first semester of 
last year along with Raymond A. 
Sorensen, professor of physics. 
James S. Langer, professor of 
physics, and Richard C. McCamy, 
professor of mathematics taught 
it in the second semester.
This method,1 Moore says, 
puts the student in a learning 
situation in which each discipline
reinforces the other right on 
the spot. The leadership lies 
with the physicist and the mathe
matics grows out of the physics 
and is given real purpose in this 
coordinated approach.
In addition, he continues, 
presentation through applica
tion of one field to the other 
gives the student a sense of the 
value of both fields that he is not 
likely to get in separate classroom 
presentations.
While it has long been the 
common practice to have a stu
dent enrolled in engineering or 
science spend about 25 per cent 
of his time in the "humanities 
and social, the new CarnegieMellon Curriculum will do it in 
a different way by replacing 
the more traditional courses in 
English composition and Eng
lish literature with courses on 
Historical Understanding and the 
Literary Imagination. This part of 
the new curriculum, like the 
others, is geared to eliminate the 
fifth year of high school and 
give the students an opportuni
ty to form views and ideas rather 
than learn techniques only. A 
side social benefit for the eng
ineering and science majors is 
that these classes will be offer
ed to all incoming freshmen, 
thus giving the students the op
portunity for more contact with 
humanities and social science 
majors, and actors, artists, ar
chitects, and musicians from the 
College of Fine Arts.
With the introduction of this 
new curriculum, a sample firstyear students schedule might 
look something like this: In the 
first semester, he could take His
torical Understanding, the com
bined math-physics course, a 
course in civil engineering, and 
a course in mechanical engineer
ing. In the second semester, he 
could take the course in Literary 
Imagination, the math-physics 
course, either of two courses in 
chemistry, and if he wished, an
other engineering department, or 
any of the available electives.

In the first year, the humanities 
account for about 25% of the total 
program, the math-physics course 
about 37%, and the electives 
about 38% of the total. As part of 
the program, the student will be 
allowed two more electives in 
his sophomore year.
Of course, one of the im
portant objectives of the new 
program is to attract the best stu
dents, says Dr. Carlin. We 
want no program which turns away 
the achievement oriented, but 
we do want something more, 
such as higher verbal skills and 
a larger component of venture
some originality. We want a 
program which helps the student 
develop his ability to combine 
what he has already learned with 
information that he must dig out 
for himself so as to create some
thing fresh and new.
As the designers of the new cur
riculum see it, some of the ma
jor benefits for the incominb stu
dents are: (1) more exposure to 
a variety of career areas so tht 
better decisions can be made;
(2) more flexibility in choice of 
courses; (3) elimination of the 
fifth year of high school;
(4) a degree of exposure to 
senior faculty members in pro
fessional areas not duplicated 
anywhere for first-year students;
(5) presentation of material, es
pecially math and physics, in 
such away as to stress the value 
of one to the other; (6) giving 
engineers and scientists the op
portunity for more contact wit 
social scientists, humanists, ac
tors, musicians, artists and ar
chitects.
Not all the elements in the 
program are new to engineering 
education. What is new and sig
nificant, however, is the oppor
tunity for more contact with so
cial scientists, humanists, ac
tors, musicians, artists and ar
chitects.

African Culture 
To Be Featured
The International Club and 
SPIRIT have organized an Afri
can Symposium which will be 
conducted on the campus of 
Carnegie-Mellon University from 
Nov. 4 till Nov. 8, 1969. The 
chief purpose of the symposium 
is to begin to fill the education
al need which exists among most 
students with regard to nonWestern culture, and specifical
ly about Africa. The program is 
also designed to bring both 
black and white Americans to an 
awareness of the rich traditions 
of African civilization, an aware 
ness of the rich traditions of 
African civilization, an aware
ness which is crucial in the cur
rent period of racial conflict. 
As the young African nations be
gin to exert increased influ
ence on international affairs, it 
is most important that American 
leaders and citizens understand the 
history and the needs of these 
countries.
The Symposium will include 
programs on African socio-poli
tical patterns, on the impact of 
urbanization, and on contempor
ary African art. For four consecu
tive days, Nov. 4 - 7W students 
and the Pittsburgh public will be 
invited to hear informed Africans 
and Africa Studies experts dis
cuss the problems of that con
tinent. Each presentation will be 
supplemented by a discussion 
conducted by a panel of African 
students who are attending local 
universities. In addition, there 
will be the opportunity to attend 
African art exhibits, films, and 
cultural performances during the 
entier week of the symposium.
The African Symposium may 
well serve several complemen
tary functions. It is hoped that 
it will demonstrate the the com
munity that Pittsburgh academia 
is aware of and concerned with 
the society beyond the campus. 
It is also hoped that the sym
posium will stimulate interest to 
the extent that a more extensive 
black studies program will be sup
ported.
The program is being coordina
ted and assisted by students and 
faculty at C-MU, members of 
SPIRT, and several external or
ganizations. At the present time, 
final attempts are being made 
to round up funds in order to 
permit a complete and stimula
ting program.

Dean Appears Open and Enthusiastic
by Linda Rye
When I went to interview Dean Williams, I though I 
knew pretty much what to expect. I had been in the Deans 
offices belore and have been faced with the large desk set 
in front of a window so the light was always behind the 
Dean, and you could never see his face. I expected the 
polished pompous desk and the one or two small paranoid 
chairs in front of it.
I was unprepared for the unusual sized busy looking 
desk and the collection of chairs that lined the room al
most dwarfing it. Dean Williams was as disarming as his 
office: a big man who carried himself easily and greeted 
me with a hall-of-fame smile.
For a man of his experience, Dean Williams is amaz
ingly open. He has been at Virginia State, has done grad
uate work at Pitt, and administrative co-ordination at 
NYU. He has worked with students as an elementary 
teacher, vice-principal and principal, as well as seven 
years as a Dean in the pre-college program at CarnegieMellon during the summer. None of this has blunted his 
enthusiasm for the student as a person. When I asked him 
what he enjoyed most about being a Dean, he answered 
immediately, Getting to know the youngsters. Then he 
frowned slightly, I shouldnt have said youngsters. Ive 
got to watch that.
Almost predictably, Dean Williams favorite spot on 
campus is Skibo because of the opportunity it provides to 
get to know students on an informal basis.
I asked Dean Williams why he had decided to come to 
Carnegie as Dean of Men. He said that he was excited 
about the age group and the informal atmosphere as well 
as influenced by a long standing friendship with Dean 
Swank. Besides, he grinned, I though it would be cool 
for the school to have a black Dean. Im sure it messes up 
all the stereotypes.
Dean Williams represented himself as being all for the 
C-MAP program. I couldnt knock it, he said seriously. 
Anything that has permitted black students access to 
higher education is just magnificent. I can go back to my
self as a kid when I never dreamed of being able to enter 
any college. He told me that he could remember that 
when he was younger and living in Pittsburgh, he was giv
en tickets every year to go to the Shakespeare festival at 
Carnegie Tech. I really was impressed, he reminised, 
And then I only saw the Fine Arts building, and I thought 
that it was the whole college. I didnt even realize the 
other buildings had any connection.
"Three hundred and seventy 
thousand veterans will be at
tending institutions of higher 
learning this fall: 70,000 more 
than in 1968," Administrator 
of Veterans Affairs Donald Johnsonsaid.
Although those men on active 
duty must have completed at 
least two consecutive years of 
service to be eligible for VA ed
ucational assistance, veterans 
must have had at least 1 81 days 
of continuous service.
Johnson urged veterans en
tering training for the first time 
or changing schools or programs 
this fall to apply immediately to 
their VA Regional Office for a 
certificate of eligixility to avoid 
delays in allowance payments.
Freshmen boys must 
complete selective ser
vice form 104. These 
can be picked up from 
Mrs. Ryan in Warner 
Hall, Room 211. If 
there are any ques
tions stop by her of
fice.
Sociologist David Riesman will 
be the first Chatham Visitor in 
the 1969-70 program at Chat
ham College.
Mr. Riesman's three-day visit 
to the campus will include a con
vocation on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 
at 11 a.m. in the College Chap
el. He will discuss "Women's Ed
ucation and the Future Pattern 
of American Colleges." The pub
lic is invited.
Mr. Reisman is author of "The 
Lonely Crowd" and "Faces in the 
Crowd" and is the co-author, 
with Christopher Jencks, of "The 
Academic Revolution." In recent 
years Mrs. Riesman's research 
has been primarily concerned 
with American higher education.
The Chatham Visitor pro
gram, supported by a grant 
from the Laurel Foundation, pro
vides an opportunity for the stu
dents and faculty of the college 
to meet and talk with men and 
women of high distinction in 
American life.

Our Distinguished Dean Williams
When I asked Dean Williams how he felt about the 
black floor in Morewood, I was at first surprised when he 
said, Im really not too concerned about it. He went on 
to explain. If its supportive to black students, if it will 
help them get through college here, then its okay. His 
eyes took on an amused, reflective look. Its a strange 
world, he mused. There have been all white floors for 
years and is anyone concerned about that?
And when I asked him how he felt about the whole 
Black-Is-Xeautiful movement, his whole face lit up as he 
said slowly, Oh, I think that it is just great! 
Williams operates on a fantastic schedule. He is going 
from 8 in the morning until 10 at night, and he is involved, 
as he says, In everything I can get my fingers in. He 
paused and looked at the ceiling, then said in a joking, con
fidential tone, Sometimes I think Im sick.
It is easy to see how all that energy and time is need
ed by a man with the ideas of Dean Williams. He says that 
ideally he would like to be a friend to the student. Many ad
ministrators say this ; I think Dean Williams means it. His 
goal is to be accepted as Chuck Williams above every
thing else.
He told me the story of one of his friends, a student 
who knew him when he was a summer dean. Everytime 
he saw me, Dean Williams smiled, he said, Hi Dean! 
or How are you Dean? or Good to see you Dean! Final
ly, at the end of the summer, he came running up to me 
and said, Hey, I just found out you are really are a dean. I 
thought it was your first name.
When I asked him what three words he would use to 
describe himself, he laughed and said, Oh, lovely, beau
tifulno. I didnt mean that. Then he frowned and said, 
Im more complex than three words. That, no doubt, is 
true, but I think of him as the man whose office is full 
of chairs instead of unworn wall-to-wall carpeting and dis
turbingly indirect lights.

Letter I
Editor, The Tartan:
At one time I was very excited 
by the existance of what has been 
called the New Left. It seemed 
that SDS was what was happening. 
I would join and help end the war, 
racism, and a bunch of other evils.
Either my world-view of SDSs 
analysis has changed (probably 
the first). I no longer see anyone 
who opposes the same evils as I 
do as being right. If violence is 
wrong in Vietnam it may very 
also be as wrong in Chicago in Oc
tober.
I can only hope that any local 
SDS that forms in the area does 
not follow the lead of the national 
office(s). This all led me to write 
the following letter to the Chicago 
national office over a month ago.
Dear Sirs,
My membership is still active, 
but rather than simply allow it to 
expire I ha9e decided to return my 
membership card and announce 
that I no longer wish to be affili
ated with Students for Democrat
ic Society.
My action is in no way an effect 
of the ideology splits within the 
existing SDS or the expulsion 
of PL.
I have come to realize that SDS 
is not, at least now, the type of or
ganization I wish to be affiliated
with. I see SDS (not necessarilly 
local chapters of SDS) as only one 
more hate-filled group of misguid
ed people. This puts me in the dilema of supporting practically all 
of the goals and wanting to help at
tain them but strongly opposing 
the means and the general atmos
phere I feel surrounds all work 
toward those goals. I wish you all 
the luck possible to attain our 
goals. I can only hope that your 
methods will become more accept
able.
It makes me sad to see a large 
organization like SDS, with such 
great leadership potential, be
coming just a group of violenceoriented hard-liners. It is not as 
important to sit and discuss politi
cal ideologies and argue analysis 
as it is to try to respect every man 
for what he is. This is not compatable with calling for violence in 
the streets.
To accomplish a change by 
forceful confrontation and vio
lence (which dehumanize) is re
bellion not revolution. This is true 
even if it calls for basic changes, 
because it accepts the most basic 
assumption of the old order; that 
power and force are the deciding 
factors and that they are more 
important than the people involv
ed. The revolution is to change 
that false assumption.
We work toward the same goals. 
Please think about these questions 
very seriously.
All power to the people?
And may all power be love.
Thomas D. Burgess, II

Letter II
Editor, The Tartan:
In spite of the faculty petition 
requesting it, President Stever 
has refused to close construction 
on campus. His reasons, aired at 
the Policy Advisory Board meet
ing, were first that it would con
stitute a political action on the 
part of the university and second 
that C-MU was in no position to 
critize union hiring policies until 
its own were demonstrably just.
We can agree that closing the 
construction is a political move  
supporting fair hiring policies; it 
is equally true, however, that con
tinuing construction is a political 
action in support of discrimina
tory hiring. As everyone knows, 
Pittsburgh is a union town and we 
congratulate Stever on choosing 
the political action that will least 
jeopardize fund raising.
We feel we must further con
gratulate the president on his honWhite construction company builds blob to blot out
