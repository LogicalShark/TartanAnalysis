Tech Employees Vote 
On Union Affiliation
Carnegie Tech custodial, housing, food service and 
operation and maintenance employees will vote for or 
against union representation later this month.
229On November 18, the 
custodial, housing, and operation 
and maintenance employees will 
have the opportunity to determine 
whether they want the Independent 
Association of Carnegie Employ
ees (I.A.C.E.); Local 29, Building 
Service Employees International 
Union; or no union representation 
at all. On November 19, the 136 
food service employees will choose 
between the I.A.C.E. or no union.
The majority of those voting will 
determine the representation of all 
involved employees. If either union 
wins, all employees will be requir
ed to accept membership in that 
union.
In accordance with its regular 
rules, the Pennsylvania Labor Re
lations Board will arbitrate any 
dispute or challenge arising dur
ing the conduct of the elections.
The representation problem be
gan about a year ago when Charles 
Levy, of Local 29, claimed that he 
had enough partitions to demand an 
employee election at Carnegie 
Tech. Several elections were 
scheduled and postponed. Then in 
late August, the I.A.C.E. was es
tablished by Carnegie Tech em
ployees. According to its presi
dent, Jack Vesely: Neither Local 
29 nor any other union wished 
to represent food personnel; we 
are interested.* The I.A.C.E. is 
especially concerned with con
ditions on the evening shifts.
Dean Of Student Affairs Sees 
Need To Criticize ID Cards
Many students have recently voiced complaints re
garding the inadequacy of the Carnegie Tech ID cards. 
It is the opinion of some that the cards do not serve 
to provide adequate identification for the student, 
especially when used off campus.
George K. Brown, dean of stu
dent affairs, feels that student 
should take immediate verbal and 
written action in order to obtain a 
more permanent card.
At this time Carnegie Tech stu
dents possess two types of iden
tification cards, the student ID and 
the library card.
Previously, according to the 
dean, Carnegie Techs identifi
cation cards included student 
pictures. These pictures were con
sidered useless, however, because 
individuals could not be recogni
zed from them.
The administration felt that the 
removal of the picture might re
sult in an Increase of bouncing 
checks, however, this proved un
true. Thus, the student picture was 
permanently removed from the 
card.
Three years ago, when the li
brary instituted a new system for 
charging books, meetings were 
held with the administration Inor
der to decide upon the type of 
library card to be used. They felt 
that there was no great advantage 
to a combination llbrary-ID card.
Thus, separate cards have been 
distributed up until this time.
Some people suggest that advan
tages to a more substantial iden
tification card (for example a plas
tic, embossed card) would include 
its use as a means of credit, and
discount buying and for other iden
tification purposes.
It is hoped by Dean Brown that 
more students will voice their 
opinions on the present ID card 
style. A larger response is need
ed to secure a more inclusive card

African Student Party
The Catholic Interracial Coun
cil (CIC) is sponsoring a Wel
come to Pittsburgh cocktail par
ty for all of Carnegie Techs Afri
can Students,
It will be held at the Webster 
Hall Hotel in Oakland on Decem
ber 10, from 8 to 11 p.m.
Admission will be free for for
eign students; other persons will 
be asked to donate $1. Drinks will 
be served to all on a cash basis.
Reservations or additional in
formation may be obtained from 
Mrs. Kevin Scanlon, 372-9313.
Design Sought 
For Snack Bar
It has long been the opinion of 
students and faculty that the din
ing facilities on the Carnegie Tech 
campus are not only unattractive, 
but in many ways inadequate as 
well. The Skibo cafeteria, par
ticularly, has been criticized for 
its impersonal, cold and wide-open 
atmosphere.
The Administration is very in
terested in what the students body 
would like to see changed in cam
pus dining areas.
Students who are aware of the 
admittedly poor accomodations are 
now challenged to present their 
ideas for improving the decor and 
service of the dining halls. Sub
mitted designs should include a 
layout or presentation of the stu
dents plan for alterations.
A faculty committee including 
Dean Brown, Dean Rice, and Dean 
Strathmeyer will judge the stu
dent plans, and award a $100 
prize to the student who presents 
what they feel to be the most ap
pealing and adequate design.
All full-time students, both 
graduate and under-graduate, are 
eligible to compete. Plans should 
be submitted to the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, Baker Hall 154, by 
November 30.
Folk Dance At Ceilidh
A Scandinavian folk dance group 
will perform at this weeks Ceilidh, 
Friday at 9 p.m. in the Wherrett 
Room.
Mrs. Ida Wicken, director of the 
group, will present a variety of 
dances including: hambos, rein
landers, schottiches, polkas and 
waltzes. All who wish will be able 
to dance along with the group.
No admission fee will be 
charged.
The performance will be follow

The Carnegie Tech administra
tion has agreed this year to give 
Campus Chest the gate receipts 
minus the normal cost of the game, 
Carnegie Tech students will be 
admitted to the game free, and no 
collection for Campus Chest will be 
made at the game.
If a person wishes to contribute 
to Campus Chest and is not con

U.A.C. Recommends
Ahtletic Policies
Recommendations for major changes in the present 
Carnegie Tech athletic policy may result from the 
first meeting of the Athletic Board on November 16. 
The board, composed of representatives of the trust
ees, faculty, alumni, and students, is President Stevers primary advisor on athletics. This will be its 
first meeting during the Presidents administration.
Various groups of students and 
members of the administration
have been discussing athletic po
licy informally for some time. 
On Saturday, the Undergraduate 
Advisory Committee (U.A.C.) 
brought up some topics which may 
be key issues in the Athletic Board 
meeting.
PuyFoukc lasCoeosco
At this time Carnegie Tech does 
not belong to any athletic confer
ence or association. Until 1962 the 
school was in the West Penn Con
ference but problems in the league 
lead the school to drop out and be
come independent. Since then there 
have been few organized rivalries 
or championships in which Carne
gie Tech athletes could participate.
By joining or organizing an ath
letic conference one student sug
gested that Carnegie Tech could 
increase spirit and recognition for 
athletes. The newspapers could 
post standings in each sport. Con
ference rivalries could build up 
traditional battles. Fans might 
even be rallied for a last place 
contest. With the selection of allconference teams, Carnegie 
Techs athletes and coaches would 
receive commendation for outstan
ding work. Final championships 
would give sports like swimming, 
track, tennis and golf something 
to aim for at the end of each sea
son.
Several on the committee sug
gested joining the Presidents Ath
letic Conference with Allegheny, 
Bethany, Case, John Carroll, 
Thiel, W & J, and Western Re
serve. Nearly half of these schools 
are already on our sports sched
ules. They are near in distance 
and close to Carnegie Techs aca
demic philosophy.
hocebkutosu
Since recruiting is the mainstay 
of any type of athletics, the com
mittee members felt that Carne
gie Tech should establish more po
sitive policy towards it. It was felt 
that alumni should be especial
ly encouraged to interest athletes 
in applying for admission. Coach
es could be given more time and 
money to personally contact top 
high school athletes who are in
terested in Carnegie Tech. Com
mittee members pointed to speci
fic instances where recruitment 
has not been emphasized and where 
other universities with a similar 
academic philosophy have built 
much better teams by placing em
phasis.
LksisckiF Pkm
Until 1962, Carnegie Tech gave 
several scholarships to outstand
ing freshmen football, basketball 
and track prospects. These 
awards, from the Steffen Fund, re
quired maintenance of a grade ave
rage but were given only to ath
letes. Carnegie Tech abandoned 
these scholarships because some 
of the schools Tech wished to play 
would not schedule games with a 
team receiving open aid.
Some of the committee mem
bers felt that athletic scholarships 
are Important factors in college 
athletic programs, especially at 
some of Carnegie
titors. They argued that the high 
cost of an education is a signi
ficant factor for the prospective 
freshman athlete. They hoped that 
Carnegie Tech might be able to 
handle scholarships within its aca
demic philosophy and yet equalize 
Tartan teams with their competi
tion.
laicyksT
Carnegie Tech has only one 
full-time coach, Mel Cratsely, ath
letic director and basketball coach. 
Every other varsity sport is head
ed by a part time coach. A few 
are volunteers and those who are 
paid receive nominal salaries.
Committee members felt that in 
general more full-time coaches 
could improve all of Carnegie 
Techs sports.
P4iem,
A suggestion was also made that 
varsity participation be given more 
recognition on the campus. The 
competition from Carnegie Techs 
strong intramural program was 
felt to be detrimental by some. 
It was offered that the fraterni
ties could establish a trophy for 
the house having the most varsi
ty participation. Or varsity par
ticipation might be weighted with 
intramurals in giving the All Sports 
Trophy.
MbBFkc hoFiukas,
Finally, members suggested that 
more stress should be placed on 
the Public Relations Office to pub
licize Carnegie Tech athletics and 
athletes. One member mentioned 
that his hometown newspaper had 
never received a news-release on 
his athletic awards or the teams 
performance. Many other schools 
send out such releases.
It was pointed out that Dr. Stever has said that Carnegie Tech 
should be front rank in every field 
it undertakes. If this includes ath
letics, then several members ur
ged that action must be taken.
Students who want their opin
ions on athletic policy voiced 
should contact members of the 
board. Student representatives are 
Dick Elder, Evan Melhado and 
Smoky Merrill. Faculty members 
include Dr. Frank Manning, che
mical enginneering; Prof. Doug
las Pickering, painting, and de
sign; and Dr. Dale Strick, history. 
The three alumni are Marshall 
Brown, Eugene Lucas and Johr 
Schmidt.

SnS Has History
Of Big Productions
Scotch* nSoda, Carnegie Techs original musical 
comedy club is an old tradition on the campus. The 
club was first organized in 1908, under the name of the 
White Friars Dramatic Club. Its first production was 
All in a Dormitory, a musical comedy of school 
life. _______________________
This organization flourished un
til 1913. Carnegie Tech remained 
without a musical club until 1932, 
when the Bacchanalians banded to
gether for the purpose of pro
ducing a musical comedy for our 
annual Spring Carnival. In 1938, 
ScotchnSoda took the job from 
the Bacchanalians with their first 
show No Strings. The name 
ScotchnSoda was used with the 
intention that the names of the 
shows would be alcoholic bevera
ges such as On the Rocks" or 
Set Em Up Again", fortunately 
this idea was never followed 
through.
For the most part SnS pro
ductions were musical reviews. 
The 1960 production of On the 
Rocks, for example, which con
sisted of such numbers as Drag 
Strip Drag, Dames Are Dumb, 
Coffee House Faust, He-Man Hero, 
April Noon, This is Your Life... 
Goldy LaRose, or Pi Zazz. These 
reviews, large in scale, with casts 
of thousands and Corps de Ballet 
were presented in the gym. The 
club either added an addition to 
the existing stage in the gym to 
create a thrust stage or else the 
show was done in the round with 
chairs and risers set up around 
the platform. The architect stu
dents began a tradition of con
verting the entrance to the gym 
into a structural unit to create 
an arcade or theater front.
Everything went fine for the 
club with the exception of a com
bined loss of $7,000 from the 1959 
and 1960 productions. In 1961 SnS 
went even bigger in production 
scale and moved its show, Ani
mation, to Carnegie Music Hall. 
Animation was a book show, 
having a plot, etc. (as are all the 
shows after Animation), but un
fortunately the show was not as 
good as the champagne party held 
for the press at Hotel Webster 
Hall. Animation took a loss of $4,- 
000 and SnS almost became past 
history.
After Animation the whole 
scale of SnS productions de
creased. The budget from the 
school went from $4,000 to $7,000 
down to $2,000. SnS set up its 
headquarters in the Skibo Ball
room. Architect students design
ed a portable, interchangeable 
stage and the school built it at a 
cost of $1,800. The stage which 
SnS rents from the school was 
designed with the possibility oi 
having three different levels. Al
so permanent celling hooks and 
other alterations were made in the 
ballroom.
Although SnS has probably had 
some of its best productions since 
1961 it has never really recovered 
in student participation and popu
larity from the Animation  
flop. SnS 1962 production, 
Viv, a show about an aging 
leading lady movie star fought hard 
to bring SnS back up. Viv 
is considered one of the clubs 
best all around productions.
In 1962 SnS presented Miss 
SnS, a spoof on the Miss Am
erica Pagaent. The director that 
year went on to be on the pro
duction staff of the real Pagaent 
that summer.
In 1963, Evnod was the show, 
a musical comedy about a compu
ter that selected stock on the even 
or odd system. Evnod was the 
first show in which a different ar
rangement of the stage was used in 
an effort to find a production style 
for SnS.
Last year, Whatserface was 
sn's creation. A musical comedy 
about the rise of a cleaning lady 
who becomes the beauty idol of the
world, it won second place in the 
BMI Varsity Show contest. As with 
Evnod, again a variation was 
made in the production style at the 
show. A hard portal and wings 
were added to the stage, a moveable set was employed and the 
show ran for six performances.
This years show, tentatively 
called Nouveau is now almost to 
the first draft stage. The show in 
its present state will employ a form 
of staging and production that is 
more individually ScotchnSoda.
Although continually changing, 
SnS is traditionally presented the 
week of Spring Carnival. Auditions, 
for this years production will be 
held December 3, 4, 11 & 12 in 
Skibo.
Y Presents 
Views of Man
The first of a series of four 
presentations on Views of Man* 
will be made at gnAf p.m., No
vember 16, in the Skibo Wherrett 
Room.
The purpose of this series is 
to explore the simple but pro
found questions about the nature 
of man and the values which are 
worth living for.
Even though the faculty partic
ipants will represent a cross sec
tion of the colleges and divisions 
at Carnegie Tech, they will be 
speaking as individuals rather than 
as departmental or college 
representatives. The two faculty 
participants paired for each ses
sion are known to represent op
posing points of view.
The speakers for the first ses
sion are two faculty from the 
College of Engineering and 
Science: Professors Sergio De 
Benedetti, physics, and Robert 
Rothfus, chemical engineering. Af
ter their opening statements, the 
meeting will be opened for ques
tions and discussion by the aud
ience.

Greek Week Established 
To Increase Understanding
From an article by 0. Edward Pollock,
Dean of Students, Union College
Greek Week has become both a symbol and a mani
festation of cooperation of the Greeks with the campus 
and the community. It began as an experiment in in
terfraternity understanding and has grown to include, 
on many campuses, a positive program of pre-initiation activities for pledges; education of the campus 
and community to the values and purposes of fra
ternities: social activities; and, in some instances, 
athletic contests.
Greek Week is a period of time 
set aside to re-examine frater
nity ideals, to appraise progress 
toward realizing these ideals and 
to acquaint the campus and com
munity with the ideals for which 
fraternities and sororities stand.
It is also a time to seek solu
tions to problems among the fra
ternities and sororities them
selves, between fraternities and 
the university, and the communi
ty at large.
Eeoo _oo .eimkukas
Greek Week tradition had its 
beginning at Ohio University in 
1930 when Professor George Starr 
Lasher recognized the need for 
the development of a program to 
bring all Greeks together for dis
cussion and analysis of their com
mon problems and values.
It was not until April 1939 that 
the title Greek Week" was used 
for the Interfraternity Conference. 
Ohio State University fraternity 
members that year instituted a 
program patterned somewhat after 
that of Ohio University. In 1941 
at Ohio State sororities were first 
invited to participate in the Greek 
Week programs.
World War n limited fraternity 
activity and brought about a tem
porary suspension of most fra
ternity activities, Including the 
annual Greek Week programs that 
had already gained wide accep
tance. In 1949 Greek Week was re
vived in its complete aspects. Not 
only were there the older pro
gram features continued, but new 
events were Included; and year by 
year through additions and modifi
cation of activities, Greek Week 
has spread to other campuses 
throughout North America, each 
presenting a similar yet distinc
tive program.
2iubeo ism lasuosu
The nature and content of Greek 
Week has taken many forms, de
pending upon the needs and re
sources of the particular campus. 
There is, therefore, no one pro
gram for Greek Week. And an at
tempt is made hereto cover a wide 
variety of programs with the ex
pectation that the particular pro
gram selected will meet the needs 
of the sponsoring campus.
An essential ingredient of al
most all programs should be the 
drive for cooperation and under
standing among fraternity and 
sorority members. Methods by 
which cooperation and understan
ding might be achieved are: dis
cussions by undergraduates, alum
ni and national fraternity repre
sentatives of topics such as fra
ternity ideals and their practi
cal application; and common pro
blems (scholarship, rushing, 
pledge training, house manage
ment finances).
Greek Week should also, if pos
sible, include discussions of CFP 
problems and operations.
Greek Aims at Carnegie Tech
Eeoo Pkt, iu liesoTko .ocy
This week the Greeks will dis
cuss possible changes in the soro
rity - fraternity system at Car
negie Tech. In particular, they will 
examine ideas with regard to ope
rating as a group in buying food 
and linen service. They will also 
evaluate the present delayed rush 
schedule.
Gibbs School Has 
Natl Scholarships
Two national scholarships for 
college senior girls are offered 
for 1966-1967 by the Katherine 
Gibbs School.
These awards were established 
in 1935 as a memorial to Mrs. 
Katherine M. Gibbs, founder and 
first president of the school.
Each scholarship consists of full 
tuition ($1,200) for the secretarial 
training course, plus an additional 
cash award of $500.
The winners will be able to se
lect any one of the four Gibbs 
schools for their training  in 
Boston, New York, Montclair, or 
Providence. They will be chosen 
by the Katherine Gibbs Scholar
ship Committee on the basis of 
college academic record, personal 
and character qualifications, fi
nancial need, and potentialities for 
success in business.
Each college or university may 
recommend two candidates, and 
each candidate must have this of
ficial endorsement. Students who 
may be interested in competing 
for one of these Katherine Gibbs 
awards may obtain full informa
tion from the college placement 
bureau.

Long Needed Changes
It has long been obvious to the students of Carnegie 
Tech, that Skibo, as a student union, leaves much to be 
desired. The building provides no places where the stu
dents can sit comfortably and socialize informally, the 
snack bar included; there is no place in Skibo which 
provides any form of intimate atmosphere; there is no 
place to dance; and there are only minimal recreational 
facilities. It is time that this situation be remedied.
The student government, specifically the Student 
Union Committee of Student Congress, 'chaired by 
Bruce R. Handley, junior, electrical engineering, and 
Raymond W. Boorstein, senior, graphic arts, is formu
lating concrete plans which could precipitate imme
diate amelioration of many of the problems existing 
in Skibo today.Among the plans now nearing completion are: (l)the 
installation of a self-service counter in the snack 
bar for food items which do not require preparation, 
thus allowing for more rapid snack bar service; (2) 
the installation of booths along the railing in the snack 
bar, and the addition of lowered ceiling lights through
out the snack bar to provide a more comfortable at
mosphere; (3) the placement of curtains along the 
north side of the snack bar, where the ping pong 
tables are located to further close in the room; (4) 
replacement of the ping pong tables with lounge 
tables and chairs; (5) partitioning of the Highlander 
Room; one portion of the room would be reserved as a 
student game room, in which could be placed the ping 
pong tables from the snack bar, additional ping pong 
tables, and a pool table; the other portion of the room 
would continue to serve the purposes now served by 
the Highlander Room; (6) partitioning the coat room in 
half; one half would provide offices for student con
gress, and the other would continue to be used as a 
coat room; (7) the construction of two partially en
closed lounging areas against the walls of the main 
lobby.
These arrangements are by no means perfect, nor 
are they vastly comprehensive. They do provide, how
ever, for the establishment of facilities which are 
certainly far superior to those which now exist. 
Furtheremore, by virtue of the simplicity and flexi
bility of the proposals, they can be put into effect al
most immediately, for example during semester break, 
at minimal cost to the school.
The students of Carnegie Tech, through their student 
government, have taken the initiative to prepare defini
tive, realistic proposals for the improvement of Skibo, 
designed to render it more like a student union.
Because these plans did, in fact, originate with the 
students themselves, there should be no question in the 
minds of administrators the suggested improvements 
are indeed actually representative of the desires of 
the major portion of the student body. The Student 
Union Committee, is still engaged in surveying the stu
dent consensus regarding Skibo. A questionnaire pre
pared by the committee appears opposite this page to 
which the Tartan urges all students to respond.
Immediate response to these student originated pro
posals on the part of the administration, followed ra
pidly by tangible results, will serve as a stimulus for 
increased student participation and cooperation with 
the administration in the formulation of long range, 
more comprehensive projects for a student union.
The Student Union Committee is in the process of 
preparing complete and comprehensive drawings of 
these improvements, and will formally present their 
proposals to the administration sometime near the 
first of December. When these plans are finalized, 
the Tartan urges the administration to approve them 
and install the new facilities without delay.

Meridian
After I left Hattiesburg, I was assigned to Newton County (consider
ed to be a virgin territory). It is next to Neshoba County where the 
Schwerner-Chaney-Goodman murders occurred. Newton also borders 
on Lauderdale County where Meridian, one of Mississippis largest 
cities, is located. This was the headquarters of three CR workers 
and the place they were heading on the day they were murdered.
My first night in Meridian, I stayed in town with a very nice family. 
When I saw that they had a bathtub, I asked if I could take a bath. 
They readily agreed and the next thing I knew, the children were walk
ing past me with buckets of water. I realized then, there wasn't any 
plumbing. But there was a bed and for the first night in a week, I slept 
comfortably.
The KuKlux Klan was going to hold a rally seven miles outside of 
Meridian. During the day, they were going to walk through the streets 
and visit recently integrated restaurants in Meridian. This was an 
effective tactic, as many of the local people, who probably best under
stand the KKK and what it stands for - Kill-Kill-Kill  were badly 
shaken up.
Some Negroes had decided to test the newly integrated accommoda
tions at the time. There were many Klansmen in robes walking up and 
down the street. One white volunteer was attacked. He heard a Klansman 
say Mess him up a little. The next thing he knew he was being beaten. 
This all occurred in the heart of downtown Meridian. The police, how
ever, soon broke it up. The many FBI men on the scene refused (as 
they have in the past) to act. It is a common occurrence for civil rights 
men to be beaten while members of the FBI stand there and take notes.
In Washington four weeks ago, during a conversation with Attorney 
General Katzenbach and John Doar, Civil Rights Commissioner, the ques
tion was asked whether the FBI men would stand and take notes if a 
bank were being robbed. The answer given suggested that they wouldnt 
take notes but would, infact, make an arrest. Then the question was asked 
what the FBI would do if a man-not a civil righter-were being attacked. 
Katzenback said that they would make an arrest and protect the beaten 
man. Both criminal acts are considered felonies. When it was asked 
whether the FBI would act if the man were a civil rights worker, a ne
gative answer was given. It was carefully explained that although a felony 
(would have been) committed, a policy stated that the Justice Department 
would not intervene because of the politics involved.
As I was walking In downtown Meridian, a policeman in a patrol car 
stopped and signalled me over. When I got there three policeman sur
rounded me and told me to put my hands against the car and my legs 
out. They proceeded to frisk me and then took me to the station for 
questioning. When I left, a Klansman photographed me. I was going to 
tell him that the Klan already had my picture from marches in Jack
son. They knew my name and address before I got there. This is a police 
state.
Editorial
Irresponsible Representation
The Tartan reported in its last issue that the Fi
nance Committee of Student Congress had scheduled 
two open meetings to speed the passing of the stu
dent activities budget. The first of these, which con
cerned all student organizations except publications, 
was held on Thursday evening; the second, devoted to 
publications budgets, occurred on Sunday evening. 
All members of student Congress, Executive Coun
cil, and all student organizations were invited to at
tend.
Only a handful of people did, in fact, appear at these 
meetings, and these individuals were those most di
rectly concerned with the actual preparation of the 
budget.The student activities budget is one of the most 
important items handled by the student government, 
for upon the quality and soundness of this budget de
pends the successful financial operation of all student 
organizations. The minimal attendance at the Finance 
Committees meetings, however, indicates that the 
members of student government have no interest in 
the allocation of the funds which the administration 
provides to finance student activities.
The members of student government, especially of 
Student Congress, were chosen by their fellow students 
to represent them. The disinterest in financial matters 
which these representatives have displayed indicates 
that they are shirking this important responsibility. 
Student government cannot perform its functions pro
perly unless its officers have the full support of the 
general membership of the government.
The students of Carnegie Tech have a right to and a 
need for proper representation in student government. 
The Tartan maintains that those who do not intend to 
fulfill their responsibilities as student representatives 
should never have accepted them.
The Tartan urges these individuals to re-evaluate 
their responsibilities, and to resolve to actively ful
fill them, for only with their support can the student 
government fulfill its potential as a dynamic force on 
this campus.

Record Dance Provides 
Varied Musical Moods
Editor, the Tartan:
In the editorial of two weeks 
ago concerning the Saturday night 
dance of Homecoming, it was point
ed out that on almost any weekend 
of the school year, one could easily 
find loud and noisy music to which 
to dance at TGIFs and fraternity 
parties. I would like to point out 
that in addition to these, and In 
complement to them, one can also 
find the Tech Record Dance.
The TRD, as it is called, is 
sponsored by Kappa Chapter of 
Alpha Phi Omega, the national 
service fraternity. Spaced approx
imately every other weekthroughout the year, allowing for vacations 
and big weekends, the TRD is open 
to all college-age men and women. 
While jackets and ties are re
quired, the atmosphere is relaxed 
and informal. Dancing is varied 
according to the mood of the eve
ning and to requests, fast or slow.
The Tech Record Dance, I feel, 
fulfills a purpose on campus. It 
provides a variety of dance music, 
neither all slow nor all fast. It is 
someplace for freshmen to go 
before rushing begins, or for 
fraternity men to go if there are 
no parties. It is a place to which 
to bring a girl, either to begin or 
to end an evening. The TRD, in 
this respect, adds to and com
plements weekend life here at 
Tech.

MorseLectures 
On Workshop
A report on the Cosanti Foun
dation Summer Workshop will be 
given in Room 210 of the Fine 
Arts Building at 4 p.m., on No
vember 23.
Ray Morse, junior architec
ture, will be the speaker.
Hie workshop, a 7-week course 
from June 7 to July 25, 1965, was 
held at Arizona State University. 
Paolo Soleri, an Italian engineer 
working on architecture and sculp
ture in the Arizona desert, super
vised the course.
The lecture on the workshop will 
include readings slides and read
ings from Soleris paper (of the 
project) Genesis of Leisure.
For one of the workshops pro
jects the participants, students 
from the U.S., Paris, and Japan, 
constructed an earthen mound as 
a form work for concrete roofing 
structures.
In another project, the students 
used silt and wood formers to con
struct an apse 32 feet in diameter 
and 16 feet high. Such processes 
may be applied in the construc
tion of inexpensive mass housing.
There will be a question and 
answer period after the program.
Math - Science Tutors
Tutors for freshmen in che
mistry, physics, and calculus will 
be available every Sunday night 
(except November 28) through De

The Search 
For Understanding
by.James Panepinto
Battle
Between The Sexes
_yiuY, 5aksT -s litrb,G
by Tina Entreil
Birth Controlthe
Last week the comparison be
tween Chinese and American cul
ture clearly pointed out the dis
contentment inherent in the Ameri
can way of life. Searching for 
causes for this discontentment, 
one may argue that the battle be
tween the sexes has been a signif
icant factor. The battle" has pre
cipitated In our society because of 
man's adoption of the dominant 
role and his subsequent restriction 
of woman's role.
It is important to point out that 
masculine dominance is not the 
natural state of life. A quick glance 
throughout history reveals the ages 
when it was the mother, the woman, 
who played the important role in 
life. At these times each man in 
the clan was bound to respect the 
honored position of the mother. 
Needless to say, a terrific battle 
must have preceded the transition 
from matriarchate to masculine 
domination in these cultures. 
There is evidence to suggest that 
masculine domination occurred 
chiefly as a result of constant bat
tles between primitive peoples, 
during the course of which man 
assumed the more prominent role 
as warrior, and finally used his 
newly won superiority in order to 
retain the leadership for himself 
and his own ends.
A growing child need not read 
books on primitive cultures to 
discover these facts. Despite the 
fact he knows nothing about ar
chaeological data, he can sense 
that the male is the privileged 
member of the family. This hap
pens even when parents are dis
posed to create a sense of equal
ity. A male child is favored more 
at birth than a female, and there is 
reinforcement in most families 
which favors the male over the 
female. Through the eyes of a 
child, females are subservient to 
males, being primarily concerned 
with housework and other domestic 
activities. Males are usually en
gaged in more meaningful activity 
even though there exists an ever 
increasing number of career* 
woman. If the head of the house
hold is male, then the male child
Ultimate Solution?
acquires a sense of superiority 
while the female child gains what 
might even be called an inherent 
sense of inferiority. The belief in 
her inferiority is forced upon a 
female by her environment.
The male child forms an identity 
a masculine identity in which 
courage, strength and duty, the 
acquisition of positions, honors 
and titles become primary char
acteristics. There exists a con
stant battle for personal super
iority since the male child has 
learned that dominance is import
ant in all situations.
Therefore, even if a man at
tempts to equalize his relation
ship with females, often he is 
unable to because of the useless 
pressure which forces every man 
to prove his masculinity under all 
circumstances. To remain the 
dominant force, a man has to use 
any means, whether justified or 
not. This creates distrust which 
is so universal between the sexes. 
As a result, humanity in general 
suffers.
The exaggerated masculine ideal 
signifies a constant challenge, a 
constant spur, a restlessness 
which results in discontentment in 
our society. Both sexes are forced 
into politics by adopting roles for 
which they are not suited. Lives 
become unnecessarily complicated 
relationships are robbed of their 
candorthe hope of happiness van
ishes.
Is the battle" a myth? Or does 
the theory suggested provide a 
reasonable, worthwhile explana
tion of the conflict? TTie suggested 
theory obviously doesnt have all 
the answers. However, it still has 
an important use. It can be used 
as a basis from which further 
theories can be developed. This 
theory can be modified by an 
introspection of one's self and an 
examination of our society.
This is an interesting and im
portant topicone which has not 
been significantly answered in the 
pastone from which much can 
be gained by perceptive and crit
ical thought.

Burns Gives Warning Against 
Perpetual Prosperity Delusion
Rather than cling to delusions about perpetual 
prosperity, let us do what we can as a people, first, 
to prevent overheating of the economy in the imme
diate future, second, to strengthen our defenses against 
future recessions, warned Dr. Arthur F. Burns, 
president of the National Bureau of Economic Research here today. _______________________
Delivering the third and final 
lecture in the 1965 Benjamin F. 
Fairless Memorial Lecture Ser
ies at Carnegie Tech, Dr. Burns 
pointed out that probably our great
est economic achievement since 
World War II is the moderation 
of the business cycle, but caution
ed that it still does exist and said 
we must act in times of prosperity 
to insure against any serious eco
nomic contraction.
Dr. Burns traced the historical 
search for ways of preventing or 
moderating the business cycle, 
which he said started before the 
Great Depression, became more 
intense as a result of it, and cul
minated after World War n in a 
new philosophy of government in
tervention. Thus, said Dr. Burns, 
in recent decades, the business 
cycle has no longer run a free 
course."
He added that this government 
intervention, combined with more 
efficient control of inventories by 
the business community and struc
tural changes in the economy have 
combined to moderate the business 
cycle." Unfortunately, he said the 
recent progress we have made in 
this area has given rise to the 
view, which is spreading among 
businessmen as well as intellec
tuals, that the business cycle has 
been mastered."
He pointed out that on all sides 
proponents of the new econo
mics" tell us that the govern
ment has finally resolved to ma
nage prosperity through tax legis
lation or government spending. TTie 
new economics" does provide a 
useful framework for economic 
thinking about some of the pro. blems surrounding our national 
prosperity he said, but, he added, 
it would be unwise to permit 
this theory or any other to lull us 
into the belief that prosperity is as
sured by the government. The new 
fiscal theory might help to reduce 
mistakes in governmental policy, 
but it surely cannot prevent mis
takes. Citing the comparative 
absence of an inflationary psycho
logy in the past few years as one 
of our greatest economic assets, 
Dr. Burns pointed to increased 
borrowing by individuals and busi
ness, increased spending and bor
rowing by state and local govern
ments, and a new upsurge of fede
ral spending, as contributing to 
increased cost and price pres
sures, and added an inflation
ary psychology is again becoming 
a force in the market place, and
this may lead to economic trou
ble."
Whatever may have been the 
case a year or two ago, it would 
be clear from the more recent be
havior of wages and prices ti.at 
the federal government cannot con
tinue persuing policies that re
lease powerful expansionist forces 
and yet trust that its guideposts 
for prices and wages will prevent 
inflation," he warned. A less 
liberal monetary and fiscal policy 
is now advisable, not only in the 
interest of the domestic economy, 
but also for reasons connected with 
our international dealings."
Turning to the problem of un
employment, Dr. Burns again 
stressed that we must deal with 
the structural causes and for this 
purpose, he urged that compre
hensive statistics on job vacancy 
are essential and that we take 
quick action to strengthen the un
employment insurance system 
by extending coverage to some 
of the millions who are still de
nied this protection." But he warn
ed that such a liberalization must 
be accompanied by stiffer eligi
bility requirements," so that sea
sonal and intermittant workers, 
who are already a heavy drain on 
the insurance system, may be 
largely kept out."
He cautioned that in the past, 
such legislation has been passed 
during periods of recession, but 
added that its effect came too 
late to aid recovery.
Dr. Burns suggested that the 
economy does not now need any 
stimulus but added that this con
dition will not continue indefinite
ly, and tax cuts will be needed.
In another two years or so,
If the budget is again nearly in 
balance, the federal government 
should be able to embark pru
dently on a systematic program 
of annual tax reductions."
According to Dr. Burns, the 
true test of any economic system 
is whether it betters human life. 
We have preserved the essen
tials of economic and political
Phones Damaged 
By Overloading
Action is now being taken to keep 
the Morewood Gardens' house 
phones in working order.
George K. Brown, dean of stu
dent affairs; Virginia B. Milligan, 
dean of women; Harriet R. Thorpe, 
resident head of Morewood Gar
dens; Carl D. Thomas, director of 
buildings and grounds; and George 
A. Deemer, superintendent of 
buildings and grounds met recently 
to discuss the problem.
The increased number of More
wood Gardens residents has re
sulted in an increased use of the 
house phones; this has caused the 
overloading and breakdown of some 
channels.
New equipment has been order
ed to handle the larger volume of 
calls and two spare channels will 
be installed.
If there is no dial tone when a 
house phone is picked up, callers 
are advised to hang up and try 
again. Waiting for a dial-tone adds 
to the channels overload and may 
cause further trouble.
freedom in a revolutionary age, 
when many other nations have 
lost or destroyed their freedom," 
he said.
Our future can be still bet
ter if we remain constantly alert 
to governmental economic poli
cies, seek to improve them by 
being receptive to new economic 
ideas, and yet remain mindful of 
the teachings of experience about 
the vital importance of free mar
kets, adequate economic incen
tives, and prudent management."

Page 8 - CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN - Wednesday, November 10, 1965
An outnumbered, outweighed Carnegie Tech team that the Saturday morning 
papers had predicted would be not much of a match for Westminster played 
the powerful Titans to a standstill for three quarters and came within a few 
yards of pulling the upset of the year before losing out in the last two minutes 
of the game at Tech Field last Saturday.
With the score tied 21-21 late in 
the final period, Westminster stop
ped a Tart an drive on the three yard 
line and then moved upfield on the 
passing of quarterback Smitty Cor
nell to score the winning touch
down with just 1:54 left.
.ocy EeiB, Voim
The Tartans, five-touchdown un
derdogs to a Westminster power
house that has lost only 19 gam
es in the last 13 years, jumped off 
to a 21-13 halftime lead over the 
surprised Titans.
On the first play of the game, 
quarterback Tom Hubka unloaded a 
43-yard pass to Jim Clark to put 
the ball on the Westminster 30. 
A pass to Dick Bell was com
plete at the 11, from where Hubka 
hit co-captain Bill Coleman in the 
end zone on second down to give 
Tech a quick 7-0 lead.
However, the Titans tied it up on 
a 50-yard touchdown pass to Gary 
Hughes right after the kickoff. 
Then, after Westminster defensive 
back Larry Bonney intercepted a 
pass at the Tech 35 and ran it back 
to the eight, Hughes caught another 
pass in the end zone to put the 
Titans ahead 13-7.
This, though, was all the of
fense of any kind that the Titans 
could muster against the Tech 
defense until late in the third 
quarter.
:hkcacyou?? .5
After a couple of exchanges of 
punts in the second period, full
back Dick Merrill rambled 38 
yards with a pass to the West
minster 35-yard line. Four plays 
later Tech scored on the most 
bizarre play of the game. Hubka 
fired a pass to Bell, who was sur
rounded by three Titan defenders 
at the goal line. Bell just got a 
hand on the ball when a Titan tip
ped it, and it bounced into the air. 
But Jim Clark was right there 
to grab the pigskin and dive into 
the end zone for his second touch
down. When Fred Brown kicked the 
point after, Tech led 14 to 13.
Immediately after the following 
kickoff, the fired-up Tartans poun
ced on a fumble at the Westmin
ster 20. Hubka passed to Bell for 
six yards, then found Larry Getto 
all alone and hit him for his third 
touchdown pass. Browns PAT sent
the Tartans to the lockers at halftime with a 21-13 margin.
woeekFF Eou, 3beu
Tech's fortunes took a turn for 
the worse in the third quarter 
when Dick Merrill, separated his 
shoulder while carrying the ball. 
Merrill, Tech's leading ground - 
gainer and co-captain had to leave 
the stadium and will be a doubtful 
starter for the W & J game.
Meanwhile Westminster, strug
gling furously to get back in the 
game, finally scored late in the 
third quarter on a 14-yard pass 
from Cornell to Emerick in the 
corner of the end zone. The Ti
tans went for two points and made 
it, tying up the game on a con
version pass to Frank Smorgiasso.
Bell returned the ensuing kickoff all the way to Westminster's 
40, but the play was called back 
for offsides. After this, Tech and 
Westminster battled to a stand off 
until, with five minutes to go in 
the game, Hubka tossed a 15 yard 
sideline pass to Clark, who ran 
out of bounds on the Westmins
ter five.
A penalty put the ball on the 
three, but on first down the West
minster line charged through and 
nailed Hubka for a ten-yard loss. 
The Tartans most of them weary 
from playing both ways, couldn't 
make up the yardage on three pass 
plays, and Westminster took over 
on downs.
Titan quarterback Smitty Cor
nell, racing the clock now, moved 
his team downfield with a series 
of sharp passes. Cornell finished 
the winning drive himself by roll
ing out four yards for a touch
down with 1:54 left to hand the 
Tartans a heartbreaking 28 - 21 
loss.
Westminster has now won five of 
seven games, while the Tartans are 
1 and 6. Tech finished up the 1965 
season shooting for its second vic
tory this Saturday at home against 
Washington and Jefferson.

Harriers Prepare
For Invitational
Schenley Park will be the scene of Pennsylvanias unofficial small 
college cross-country championship this Saturday at 11:30 a.m. when 
the first Carnegie Tech Invitational race is held.
The competitors, in order of 
fear by Techs runners, include 
Waynesburg, Westminster, Gan
non, W&J, Geneva, and St. Vin
cent. Waynesburg ruined Tech's 
fouryear, 42 victory string two 
weeks ago, 23 to 33. Then West
minster handed the Tartans their 
second loss, 26-29.
Both those meets were away, 
and the Invitational gives Tech a 
chance to meet these squads on 
the home ground of Schenley Park.
Waynesburg is so concerned about 
the meet that the whole team 
drove up to Pittsburgh last week
end to practice on the Schenley 
hills.
.ocy _ks, Vi,u .4a
Last week Tech warmed up for 
the Invitational by shutting out St. 
Vincent 15-50 and beating Gan
non 21-34. Harry Burkholder won 
the St. Vincent meet in 23:20, 19 
seconds off the course record, des
pite the lack of any close com
petition. Tech swept the first nine 
places in this meet. Against Gan
non, Chris Macosko and Roger
