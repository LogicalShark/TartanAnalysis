Chairman, Bovard, Resigns;
Trustees Elect Fisher
James M. Bovard today announced his resignation as Chairman of the Board 
of Trustees of Carnegie Institute of Technology at a meeting of the board on the 
Carnegie Tech campus. Bovard, who has served Carnegie Tech in that position 
since 1948, will remain a member of the board and will continue in his position 
as President of the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Institute and the Carnegie 
Library.
At the same meeting the Carnegie Tech board elected Aiken W. Fisher, chair
man of the board of Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, as Bovards suc
cessor.
Thorpe Retires From Post 
As MG Resident Head
Mrs. Harriet Thorpe, resident head of Morewood 
Gardens, will retire from her position on January 28, 1966.
Mrs. Thorpe has served in this capacity for two 
years. Prior to her appointment at Carnegie Tech, 
she was resident head at Florida Southern and Ohio State Universities.
At Ohio State, Mrs. Thorpe was 
also supervisor of laboratory ex
perience for graduate students in 
a resident training program. She 
worked under the direction of psy
chology department of Ohio State.
During her residency at Morewood Gardens numerous changes 
and revisions have been made in 
resident housing policy. In the area 
of student government, a sepa
ration of the judicial branch of 
government was instituted. The ju
diciary council was set up to deal 
specifically with disciplinary ac
tion for female students.
The liberalization of regulaDraft Deferment Based On 
Students Academic Standing
On December 23, 1965, Lt. Ge
neral Lewis B. Hershey, Selective 
Service Director, issued a state
ment on student deferments. Fol
lowing are excerpts from the text 
of his statement:
The United States, for the past 
several months, has been increas
ing its armed forces. Prior to this 
increase the supply of young men 
available for induction was great 
enough to permit the minimum 
requirements for deferment. This 
was particularly true in the de
ferment of students.
It must always be remembered 
that young men for many and com
pelling reasons constitute the great 
bulk of the armed forces. It fol
lows that mobilization in any 
volume affects primarily the agen
cies engaged in the training of 
young men. These are largely 
schools, colleges, and universi
ties.
The deferment of a student is 
based on a determination that he is 
full-time and remains a satisfac
tory student. There is a lack of 
uniformity among educational in
stitutions as to the number of hours 
required for full-time standing. 
Local board must use their best 
judgment in each individual case.
When a student is satisfactory is 
a matter of Judgment and, by law, 
the local board must decide this 
question. The information pos
sessed bytheschool is of thegreatest importance but to be valuable, 
it must be furnished to the local
board in timely fashion. This pla
ces a responsibility on education
al institutions that is both diffi
cult and time-consuming, but it 
must be met. Satisfactory partici
pation cannot be assumed. Evi
dence must be positive.
The Selective Service System 
understands that institutions ex
pel and suspend for other than aca
demic reasons. Violation of insti
tutional rules results in a student 
becoming less than satisfactory to 
the institution. When this is report
ed to the local board, it causes 
his reclassification. Currently this 
reclassification is likely to result 
in very early induction.
Similarly, a student to be satis
factory to the local board must not 
disobey the law or regulations of the 
Selective Service System. Per
haps lt cannot be repeated too 
often that the Congress made liable 
for service all registrants 18-1/2 
to 25, inclusive. By law they are in 
Class 1-A until, by local board ac
tion, they are placed lnsomeother 
classification. No registrant is de* 
ferred unless lt be in the national 
health, safety, or interest. De
ferment is not for the convenience 
of the individual registrant, al
though the nation's interest may at 
times coincide with the regis
trants desires.
These are dangerous and un
certain times. All on the campus 
share all of the uncertainties of 
other citizens. If the uncertainty

tlons included extended hours and 
the establishment of an honors 
tower for seniors and high-ranking juniors. Senior women and fe
male students over the age of 
twenty one are now permitted to 
reside off-campus.
Sorority floors were provided 
for the seven womens fraterni
ties.
Mrs. Thorpe has intensified the 
program for Morewood Floor 
counselors by extending the num
ber of hours of training. Student 
resident assistant positions, un
der a work-study program, have 
also been established. Working in 
these positions Includes floor 
counseling, work at Morewood 
Main Desk, and participation in 
the commuter program.
A commuter counseling program 
was set up to provide an orienta
tion for freshmen women. Mem
bership to the Dormitory Council 
has been offered to commuters.
Mixers, teas, and the annual art 
show are among the activities ori
ginated within the past two years.
Mrs. Thorpe states that she has 
thoroughly eitfoyed the residents 
at Morewood Gardens. She attri
butes this to the variety In aca
demic and professional goals 
among the students.
She feels that the students are 
above average in perceptiveness 
and in ability to handle abstract 
concepts. Students are ableto han
dle and carry through projects pre
sented to them.*
Carnegie Tech students are de
manding because they are intellec
tually alert. Their problems re
flect their higher motivation,'* 
says Mrs. Thorpe.

Thunderball; The Tenth Victim
hzfnp Lf.leP
Thunderball, the latest James Bond feature, Is something of disap
pointment. The beginning is rather slick - Bond (Sean Connery, of 
course) gets into a fist fight with a woman; well, sort of - but certain
ly no better than the three blind mice in Dr. No or the murder of 
James Bond in From Russia With Love. And the plot, though interesting, 
becomes confused in places.
It seems that SPECTRE has hijacked two atomic bombs and is 
threaten!^ the destruction of two cities unless they are paid the 
equivalent of one hundred million pounds. Bond with a customary as
sortment of gadgets is to foil their plan. Essentially, this is the same 
old Bond film formula but now it has become tedious.
Hie movie, as opposed to each of its three predecessors is complete
ly lackir^ in freshness; even the gadgets are stale or uninteresting. 
The dialogue, too, lacks the usual cleverness; the same puns and innuen
do are repeated incessantly. Indeed, the formula is not only beginning 
to tire, but beginning to collapse.
James Bond, if nothing else (and he is nothing else) must be suave, 
cool in the face of the overwhelming or the mundane. But in Thunder
ball, several occasions find him appearing ridiculous. Twice he uses 
devices strapped to his back to propel him, once through the air and 
later, through the ocean. On both occasions he seems a comic combina
tion of Buck Rogers and Mighty Mouse. And a machine that will osten
sibly stretch him to the breaking point looks about as dangerous as a 
rocking chair when the camera reveals Bond being vibrated. Thunder
ball, as a whole, has the double complacency of being tired of itself and 
knowing the public will not yet have tired.
Another film in the same general category produces an effect just 
the opposite of the self-boredom of Thunderball. The Tenth Victim 
finds Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress as victim and huntress 
respectively in the twenty-first century world where wars have been 
replaced by a deadly game known as The Hunt. A hunter is given the 
name of a victim whom he is to kill; the victim is to discover the identity 
of his hunter and attempt to kill him. One of them must die and the other 
receives a monetary reward. After ten successful hunts, alternately as 
hunter and hunted, one can retire as a Decathon with vast fame and 
wealth.
The special effects in the film are very intelligently handled; they 
enhance rather than distract. Though it is the twenty-first century, the 
architecture and automobiles are 1965 vintage. Since the futurism is not 
in over-abundance, gimmicks, when they occur seem all the more 
sensation - Ursula Andress' bra with the built in pistols for instance.
Andress and Mastroianni play their parts to perfection and the 
photography is excellent. The only viewers disappointed by the movie 
are tho6e who Imagine it promises, and does not present, a probing 
analysis of present-day civilization. Sociology or philosophy it is not. 
But it is precisely what it claims to be - namely, first rate entertain
ment.

She believes that Carnegie Tech 
students are concerned with their 
ability and degree of achievement. 
The climate that exists here has 
more tension because of the sense 
of competition involved.
A Tower has been successful 
because it has provided a sense 
of community living in which stu
dents establish their own organi
zations and codes for the commu
nity. Students in the honors tow
er have defined their areas of re
sponsibility by setting up a hous
ing committee and a disciplinary 
group. A voluntary signout has al
so been instituted.
Mrs. Thorpe hopes that this 
pattern of action can be extend
ed in the women's residence hall.* 
Mrs. Thorpe plans to reside 
temporarily in Cleveland with part 
of her family.
It has not yet been decided who 
will fill the position of resident 
head at Morewood Gardens.

Abolish The Draft
For '66...the best shapes in Pgh. come from...
.V I! *MW. MOTOR

ROUTE 8, ETNA
Whenever vigorous dissent con
cerning the current draft system 
is expressed, the dissenters are 
usually labeled as being unpatrio
tic or un-American. In the past 
months, demonstrations have oc
curred which indicate that many 
people feel the American way con
sists of supporting government in
stitutions or policies, apparently 
without regard for their value to 
society as a whole.
From the viewpoint of society 
as a whole, the draft clearly cau
ses vast economic waste. First, 
it forces many highly trained and 
competent individuals to spend two 
years performing duties that could 
be done by less well trained per
sonnel. If the military were ope
rated with volunteers, the social 
waste of assigning college gradu
ates or individuals with compara
ble skills to jobs below their level 
could be avoided.
To encourage enlistments, asignificant increase in salaries is ne
cessary. The starting recruit now 
earns $87.90 per month  less 
than many people on welfare re
ceive. A $200 to $300 per man in
crease would make salaries com
petitive with civilian employment. 
The cost of this would be ex
tremely high-close to $9 billion 
for the size of our current armed 
forces. However, it is reasonable 
to assume that many men would reenlist if salaries were increased, 
and this would reduce the net cost 
of the proposal. Presently, only 
about five percent of draftees reenlist, and the cost of basic train
ing ($3,387) must be absorbed for 
each new recruit.
The draft is also highly discri
minatory and by no means does it 
provide for universal military 
service. Only three out of ten men 
from nineteen to twenty-six serve 
in the armed forces. Key or essen
tial personnel of corporations may 
be granted deferments, and the re
maining portion are physically, 
mentally, or morally disqualified. 
Most of the men who serve come 
from lower income groups, since 
the majority of student and criti
cal skills deferments are usually 
from middle and higher income 
persons.
The greatest inequity of all is 
the refusal to recruit women for 
the services in the same manner 
as men are recruited. It is appa
rent that women are necessary for 
efficient functioning of the servi
ces. They, however, are provided 
enough inducements to fill the quo
ta. If the selective service act is 
considered logically, then why not

draft women also to fill quotas ~ 
or why not provide the necessary 
inducements to attract men?
In spite of all these inequities, 
and despite the social waste as a 
result of the draft, dissent is of
ten scheduled because the draft 
is viewed by most Americans as a 
necessary American institution. 
However, the draft is no longer 
necessary. TTie United States does
nt need a war-time army and the 
number necessary may very well 
be provided for if salaries reach 
a reasonable level.
Above all the points I have men
tioned lies one distressing fact. 
General Hershey, head of Selective 
Service, has been quoted as pres
cribing the draft as a cure for juve
nile delinquency as well as a means 
of handling demonstrations. In Mi
chigan, a group of college students 
who sat down in a draft office as 
a means of protesting the Vietnam 
war were declared to be draft de
linquents and were reclassified 
I-A. General Hershey reports that 
he hasn't had any trouble with 
Vietniks since. All over the coun
try state legislators are threaten
ing to cut the budgets of state 
supported institutions whose stu
dents have been protesting the draft 
or Vietnam. A democratic society 
is clearly in danger when offi
cials of the government have the 
power to punish or destroy those 
who oppose its policies.

Tpetnef_Study Time
The rapid pace and heavy academic demands of 
course work at Carnegie Tech are maintained, gene
rally speaking, even throughout the last week of 
classes before final examinations. During that week 
many students must take several hour examinations 
in various courses, must complete projects and papers, 
and must continue, of course, to keep up with new 
material being presented in class.
In most courses, a students performance on the final 
examination constitutes a major portion of the indi
viduals grade. The continued imposition of such strin
gent demands, however, makes it difficult in the ex
treme for students to begin anticipatory preparations 
for the impending finals week. In light of these facts, 
many students find it necessary to sacrifice the quality 
of their course work during the last week to permit 
them to make adequate preparations for finals. Those 
who dont generally dont get sufficient sleep, a fact 
which, in itself, is not conducive to high academic 
performance.
Some colleges and universities have established 
reading periods of several days duration between the 
termination of classes and the beginning of finals. 
The reading period, theoretically, provides students 
with the opportunity to prepare for final exams while 
free of the burden of class work. The Tartan, however, 
is not advocating the adoption of such a program on 
this campus. Indeed, to do so would be inconsistent 
with the context of the philosophy developed by the ad 
hoc calendar committee, which anticipates the ulti
mate elimination of final exams, and the development 
of an academic year which can be subdivided into 
periods of any convenient length as opposed to the 
inflexible semester system.
There is no reason why classes should not continue 
to meet until the beginning of finals week. Indeed, 
they ought to do so. At the same time, however, it 
seems reasonable to request that professors, cog
nizant of the imminence of finals and the need to 
prepare for them, arrange the presentation of course 
material such that the work load on the student during 
the last week of classes is reduced, or at least, not 
significantly increased. Hour examinations could be 
administered more than one week before finals, or even 
prior to Christmas vacation. Term papers and projects 
also could be assigned for completion well in advance 
of final exams. Moreover, in some courses, the last 
meeting or two of the class could be devoted to review, 
providing that the nature of the course is such that 
open review in class would prove beneficial. In a 
course which meets perhaps forty-five times in a 
semester, the use of one or two class periods would 
detract little, if any, from the quantity and scope of 
the subject matter considered in the course.
Proposals such as these are not unrealistic, nor, 
in general, would they be difficult to implement. To 
effect them, furthermore, would alleviate a tremendous 
burden on the students, and would aid them in attaining 
higher standards of academic excellence.

Those of you who were not for
tunate to spend the Christmas va
cation in Pittsburgh missed ano
ther shocking incident in this 
racially torn town. You will all 
remember the grave problem that 
arose in this campus last year 
during Spring Carnival. PiKA 
chose to depict a minstrel show 
in their midway booth and they ac
tually used blackface make-up on 
the plaster models. The Congress 
of Racial Equality (COREX sensing 
that racism was being practiced 
at Carnegie Tech, brought out their 
overcoming pickets. Before the 
day was over the black faces were 
painted white by the fraternity. But 
during the night a prankster re
painted one of the faces black, 
and the next day the booth was 
closed down by the Administra
tion.
All very ludicrous you might 
say, but prepare yourselves for the 
incident you missed over vacation. 
A new parking garage was recent
ly completed on Stanwix Street 
downtown. H. W. Shepard, opera
tor of the 971 car facility and 
former Carnegie Tech student, 
attempted some scholarly innova
tions. He instructed his sign paint
ers to paint Drive Slowly on 
all ramps rather than the usual 
Drive Slow. However, this bold 
step was not picketed by anybody, 
not even by SCARE (Society of 
Corrupt Architects Resentful of 
Everything).
Shepard, realizing that most 
people usually forget the number 
of the floor on which they park
ed, decided to paint each of the 
ten floors a different color. In 
addition the designating color 
would be spelled out on the walls 
in English, German, French and
Spanish. The eighth floor was 
painted black and the signs read 
Black - Schwarz - Noir - Negro, 
each of the terms being the legi
timate and common usage words 
for black in each language.
Some Negro women attending 
a dance downtown were much of
fended by the signs on the eighth 
floor of the parking garage. They 
complained to Matthew Moore of 
the United Negro Protest Com
mittee (UNPCX who then contact
ed Shepard. Moore termed use of 
the word a reflection of the Ne
gro Community. Shepard, not 
wishing to offend anybody, paint
ed over the sign (significantly with 
a can of white spray paint.) in 
the presence of newspaper and 
T.V. photographers. He offered to 
paint a substitute Spanish word 
in its place if an adequate one could 
be found.
The next day a representative 
of CORE called Shepard and re
quested the word Negro be repain
ted on the walls. William A. Cole, 
vice chairman of the local CORE 
chapter said members of his group 
are proud of being black and the 
use of the word Negro doesnt 
bother them at all.
Shepard painted Negro on the 
wall again but Indicated he wasnt 
sure how long it would be before 
some other group protested. TTie 
original incidents occurred De
cember 21 and 22 and the word 
Negro is still in place. But there 
was an ominous phone call from a 
person alleging to be from the 
John Birch Society protesting the 
color red being used on the sec
ond floor. Shepard hasnt taken any 
action yet, but it looks like a long 
year for intellectual garage opera
tors.

Editor, the Tartan:
I want to bring up one of those 
issues on which lt seems incredi
ble that action has not already 
been taken: the absence of a suit
able place to study before bU#Y
a.m. final examinations.
Many students, being slow tc 
awaken and unable to gain theii 
wits rapidly, must rise very early 
and spend some time reviewing 
(i.e. cramming) if they are to have 
any chance of surviving an bU#Y fi
nal.
Those who live on campus are 
liable to find their rooms occupied 
by sleepy roommates who happen 
not to have to get up so early; 
those who commute hardly dare 
wait until the last minute if they 
are familiar with Pittsburgh traf
fic, and must plan to do .their re
viewing somewhere on campus. 
What warm, convenient, welllighted facilities do these students 
find awaiting their eager usage?
Well, the cafeteria opens at 2U#Y 
(fine for those who have ear-plugs 
and can read in the light) and of 
course there are always the Baker 
Hall benches. In real desperation, 
one can sit on the stairs in Baker 
Hall, under one of the wall-lights.
What can be done? The solution 
that immediately occurs to some 
persons is to open the library ear
lier (e.g., 2 or 2U#Y( on final ex
amination dates. No service need 
be provided; only a token staff to 
unlock the door and prevent the 
building from being carried away 
would be needed. (Ideally, this 
might be done at say 8 a.m. 
throughout the school year, but this 
is something to work for in the 
more distant future.) This may 
prove impractical because of the 
cost or other factors, but the
S.C. Library Committee (actually 
a subcommittee, if I remember 
correctly  the S.C. is that com
plicated), if it still exists this 
year, might certainly look Into the 
matter.
As a somewhat inferior alter
nate solution, it would certainly 
be practical for some classrooms 
in, for instance, Baker Hall - 
Porter Hall, to be unlocked a bit 
ahead of the usual time, to serve 
as study areas.
Such policy could, In fact, be ini
tiated this semester, if those who 
rule over the locking and unlock
ing of classrooms are willing.

Wednesday, January 12, 1966 - CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN - Page 5
Student Opinions Reflect
Little Knowlege Of Vietnam
V r c_tiJiVin
For the past year or so many American campuses have teamed with con
troversy over the United States involvement in Viet-nam and to a certain 
extent this debate has arisen at Carnegie Tech. Last spring our history de
partment presented a panel discussion on the subject, and in May we were 
one of many schools which listened in on the national teach-in held in Wash
ington. In December the Young Republicans Club sponsored a debate on Viet-nam 
which some 200 persons attended. Thus, while our campus has not teemed 
with controversy over Viet-nam, elements of the Carnegie Tech community 
have been active on both sides of the issue, and there are indications that the pace will quicken during the remainder of the year.
Since many of the demonstra
tors against our foreign policy 
have been college students, one 
wonders what Carnegie Tech un
dergraduates have to say about the 
situation in Viet-nam. How much 
do they know about it? How do 
they regard the demonstrations? 
What do they think of our go
vernment's actions?
Between Thanksgiving and 
Christmas, 188 Carnegie Tech 
undergraduates were questioned 
regarding their opinions and know
ledge of the Vietnamese issue. 
Ninety-eight of the students were 
enrolled in E&S, with the rest 
evenly divided between MMCC and 
Fine Arts. They were representa
tive of all classes.
Each student was asked what he 
thought of the demonstrations, and 
also how justified he thought the 
United States policy in Viet-Nam 
was. After giving these opinions, 
he was asked the following ques
tions. The Geneva Pact of 1954 
created North and South Viet-nam. 
Who had controlled these regions 
for most of the 20th century up 
until 1954?" He was also asked 
to identify Men Bien Phu, Hb Chi 
Minh, Da Nang, Diem, and Plei 
Me.
Then he was given a complete
ly unlabeled map of the world, 
and asked to indicate the location 
of 1) Viet-Nam and 2) French 
Indochina. In addition to the place
ment of these two areas, the stu
dent was scored according to whe
ther he included Viet-Nam as apart 
of French Indochina, wherever he 
put them.
Opinion Survey Results 
What do you think of the people 
who are demonstrating against our 
government's policy in VietNam?"
Responses were scored as being 
either definitely for, definitely 
against, or neutral toward the de
monstrations. (Atypical neutral'* 
statement was I don't agree with 
the demonstrators, but they have 
the right to demonstrate.") Only 
9% of the students polled were 
definitely for the demonstrations.
(A typical neutral" statement 
was I don't agree with the de
monstrators, but they have the 
right to demonstrate.") Only 9% 
of the students polled were de
finitely for the demonstrations. 
41% made neutral" statements, 
and the remaining 50% were quite 
outspoken in their disagreement 
with the demonstrations. It is dif
ficult to Interpret these figures 
as showing very general support 
for the demonstrations among Car
negie Tech undergraduates. Nearly 
everyone seems to disagree with 
them at least to a certain extent.
How justified do you feel our 
government's policy In Viet-nam 
is?"
The student responded to his 
question by drawing a line through 
the scale shown below:
--------------------------------------
completely mostly about as
unjustified unjustified justified as
unjustified
------*------------------*----------
mostly completely
justified justified
16% of the sample drew their 
I lines to the left of the midpoint 
(i.e. on the unjustified" side of 
the scaleX 15% placed their mark
at the centerline, and the re
maining 69% of the responses were 
on the justified" half of the 
scale.
An interesting figure of the data 
is that only 22 of the 188 students 
thought that the United States' po
licy was completely justified." 
The average (mean) of all the re
plies was just five points to the 
right of the midpoint (i.e. halfway 
between the centerpoint and 
mostly Justified"X This is cer
tainly a cautious endorsement of 
the Administrations Vietnamese 
policy.
The data from the two opinion 
questions are in some sense In
consistent. Carnegie Tech stu
dents seem to be strongly against 
the demonstrations, and yet their 
support of the governments policy 
is half-hearted. It may be that the 
protests, by their very existence, 
have Impressed upon many that 
the United States' action cannot 
be assumed to be right. People 
might not like the demonstrations, 
but they may be cautious in eva
luating the government's moves 
because of them.
Knowledge Test Results
Considering the enormous news 
coverage of the war in Viet-Nam 
during the past two years, the 
students' performance on the fac
tual questions is quite disturbing.
Even though the knowledge re
quired was undeniably elementary, 
only 6 of the 188 students correct
ly answered all nine items, and 
but a handful more missed just 
one or two. On the other hand, 
50% of the ^students got no more 
than two right. The most fre
quent score was zero correct, and 
the average (mean) score for the 
whole sample was just 3.28.
It should be mentioned that broad 
leniency guided the scoring proce
dure. For example, battle site" 
was accepted as a correct identi
fication of both Dien Bien Phu and 
Plei Me, as was Vietnamese lea
der" accepted for both Ho Chi 
Minh and Diem. Some questions 
proved more difficult than others 
of course; the map responses were 
particularly atrocious. But Igno
rance was widespread rather than 
specific. Every question was miss
ed by at least half of the students.
In short, the data suggest that 
the average" Carnegie Tech un
dergraduate knows that Viet-Nam 
is a place somewhere in Asia 
where we are at war  and 
that is all. It is inconceivable that 
he has a very clear Idea whom 
we are fighting, or why.
It is instructive to relate the 
student's opinions to his know
ledge. Those who did well on the 
factual knowledge test had wide
ly divergent opinions regarding 
the demonstrations and the justi
fication of our Vietnamese policy. 
Thus either side of these issues 
would have well - informed" 
protagonists.
On the other hand, over 80% 
of those who knew virtually noth
ing about Viet-Nam (i.e. got 3 or 
less correct out of 9) disagreed 
with the demonstrations and sup
ported the government. It should 
be recalled that most of the stu
dents fall into this category.
How is it possible that Carne
gie Tech undergraduates are so 
ignorant of something as impor
tant and topical as Viet-Nam? When 
I asked them, the inevitable reply 
was I have so much school work
to do, I simply don't have time to 
read a newspaper." Undoubtedly 
Carnegie Tech undergraduates 
have a lot of work to do, but I 
suspect that is not the real reason 
they do not read the papers. Af
ter all, they were not saddled 
down with school work last sum
mer, when the news about VietNam was just as Intense as lt is 
today.
Two years ago over 800 Carne
gie Tech undergraduates were ask
ed what they thought ought to be 
the purpose of a college educa
tion. Most replied that college 
should give a person the training 
necessary to earn a living and/ 
or provide an opportunity for a good 
social life. Hardly anyone indicated 
that the college experience should 
lead to a better understanding of 
oneself and the world around him  
the values traditionally attributed 
to education.
Given Carnegie Tech's students* 
reasons for being in college, it is 
not surprising that they never 
heard of Diem and Ho Chi Minh 
and French Indochina, etc. They 
do not care; the stuff that news
papers are made of is not relevant 
to what Carnegie Tech undergrad
uates want.
In addition to their sheepskins, 
what incredibly dangerous attitud
es will the current senior class 
take with them from Carnegie Tech 
in June? and what about next June? 
And the next?
Draft Deferment
Continued from Page 1 
seems greater for the student, it 
is because he is of critical mili
tary age and because he has more 
to lose should our way of life suf
fer serious disarrangement.
The Selective Service System 
is well aware of the need to train 
our youth; more so, I believe, than 
the majority of our citizens. But, 
likewise, the Selective Service 
System knows equally well that the 
registrant, as a student, is only a 
potential asset for national survi
val. If dangers are great enough 
in the present there is no ques
tion that if necessary the efforts 
of all citizens must be used in in
suring the survival of the nation. 
Survival there must be. Without 
it all other questions are moot.
The student must demonstrate 
during college that he is progres
sing toward the objectives for 
which he is being trained and that 
he is the kind of an individual that 
should be trained. It is recogniz
ed by educational institutions that 
breaking their rules disqualifies 
a student from being a satisfac
tory student. It should be just as 
clear that breaking and defying 
the laws of the nation are even 
greater evidence of failure to re
main a satisfactory student.
What may eventually be the re
quirements for a student defer
ment depends on factors com
pletely outside of our nation.
Students under the jurisdiction of 
the Selective Service System 
should be aware of and comply 
with the statements as outlined 
below;
1. All students should keep in
formed of their obligations and 
rights under Selective Service.

RPI Has Varied 
Grad Programs
Graduate assistantships, scho
larships, and fellowships are be
ing offered in the communication 
and technical writing programs 
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti
tute for 1966-67.
Two programs are involved: 
Communication and Technical 
Writing leading to a master of 
science degree and Communica
tion and Rhetoric leading to a doc
toral degree.
Each assistantship provides a 
remission of tuition, together with 
a stipend. Assistants may be as
signed to teaching or research 
and are permitted to carry a 
part-time load. By taking sum
mer courses, a graduate assis
tant may complete the require
ments for the masters degree 
within a twelve-month period.
Inquiries about the program, 
assistantships, and scholarships 
should be made to Dr. Sterling 
P. Olmsted, chairman, Depart
ment of Language and Literature, 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
Troy, New York, 12181.

Tech To Aid 
Philippine U.
The Ford Foundation has given 
Carnegie Tech a grant of $711,000 
for use by the Institute for Ser
vices to Education (BE) in ex
panding the science programs of 
Minanao State University in the 
Philippines.
Carnegie Tech is part of an ed
ucational combine formed by ISE 
to carry out the purposes of the 
grant. The other schools are Indi
ana University, Rensselaer Poly
technic Institute, the University 
of Rochester, the University of 
Maryland, the University of Min
nesota and the University of Co
lorado.
With the funds, the ISE will 
provide assistance, including con
sultations, equipment and visiting 
professors, who will advise in the 
selection of equipment and library 
purchases. Faculty at Minanao will 
be freed for overseas training 
assignments at the participating 
schools. The programs to be 
strengthened at Minanao are phy
sics, chemistry, mathematics, and 
biology.
Dr. John C. Warner, former 
Carnegie Tech president, will di
rect the overall project. Dr. B. R, 
Teare, dean of the College of En
gineering and Science, will repre
sent Carnegie Tech.
The broad purpose of BE is to 
assist schools on all in this coun
try and overseas. For the past two 
summers Carnegie Tech has taken 
part in an ISE program to im
prove the quality of teaching In 
predominantly Negro colleges in 
the South.
Tech is based on at least 36 units 
of undergraduate study or at least 
32 units of graduate study.
3. Every registrant should, if he 
has not done so this academic year, 
file a current status report with his 
local board. Your desired and 
accurate address should be In the 
letter. Any change of address in the 
future must be reported at once; 
the local boartl is to be kept in
formed of your whereabouts at all 
times.
4. It is an obligation of the re
gistrant to make the initial request 
for a student deferment. It is the 
obligation of C.I.T. to support 
your request for deferment by cer
tifying your full-time enrollment 
and assisting with the appeal

Four members of the Carnegie 
Tech faculty will offer informal, 
non-credit seminars on the his
tory of the Vietnamese problem 
at the beginning of the spring 
term.
They are Leonard Bushkoff, 
Leslie Denfler and Leonard Helfgott, of the history department, 
and Lincoln Wolfensteln, of the

GSIA Prof Gets 
NSF Fellowship
Dr. Martin Bronfenbrenner, 
professor of economics in GSIA, 
has been awarded a senior post
doctoral fellowship to the Center 
for Advanced Study in Behavior 
Sciences at Stanford, California.
Dr. Bronfenbrenner was one of 
95 teachers selected from a field 
of 397 applicants who were eval
uated by panels of outstanding 
scientists appointed by the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, Na
tional Research Council. Final se
lection was made by the National 
Science Foundation.
The Center was established in 
1954 for the study of human be
havior. Its main purpose is to 
give scholars freedom from their 
usual duties on college campuses 
in order to help one another gain 
new skills and insights.
Most of Dr. Bronfenbrenners 
time will be spent working on a 
book he has already begun con
cerning the economic theory of in
come distribution. He is the author 
or co-author of several publica
tions, many of them dealing with 
the economics of the Far East.

Kirk Answers Questions Regarding 
Professionalism, Apathy, And Education At Tech
t.
4nR AinJi 0R NenP C Xgoc

Jerry Kirk is a research associate in industrial ad
ministration and sociology at GSIA. Well-acquainted 
with college life, he has spent the past thirteen years 
of his career as a student, researcher, or teacher 
at five different colleges. This fall, he completed his 
doctoral thesis on Cultural Diversity and Character 
Change at Carnegie Tech. (Excerpts will appear in the 
February 9 Tartan.)
How would you differentiate be
tween the professional and the 
vocational education?
There are two kinds of college 
education in the world: profession
al and vocational,
TTie difference between them is 
this  vocational education tea
ches people to give their loyalty 
to their employers, to do the jobs 
their employers want done. People 
under-going vocational education 
learn to follow written rules, and 
to judge their achievement by re
latively superficial signs of recog
nition (like salary or title). Pro
fessional education, on the other 
hand, teaches people to give their 
loyalty to their colleagues and to 
seek to contribute to society. Pro
fessional education teaches people 
to use their own judgment but to 
be subject to high standards of 
ethics and craftsmanship,
Academic" education, as in 
the humanities, is just a special 
case of professional education. I 
think it is a little misleading to 
contrast professional education 
with academic" or liberal" ed
ucation. Someone who is training 
to be a historian should be no 
less professional than someone 
who is training to be an engineer 
or a doctor. If we are to assume 
theres a difference between libe
ral education and professional ed
ucation, we must Intend only that 
liberal education is some shal
lower form of education than pro
fessional education: I dont think 
anyone wants that.
Tbe professional tends not to be 
a member of the organization for 
which he works in quite the same 
sense as is the laborer or the bu
reaucrat. Rather, his main loyal
ty is to a cosmopolitan national 
and international community of his 
profession, and beyond that of all 
professions  the community of 
educated men.
The profession of painting does
n't consist of drawing plus design 
plus a little art history plus a
couple of other things. Painting 
consists of the activities of paint
ers. Mechanical engineering is not 
thermodynamics plus solids plus 
fluids plus a little math and phy
sics and so on  Mechanical en
gineering consists of the acti
vities of mechanical engineers. 
So a student under-going true pro
fessional education regards his 
teachers as potential colleagues. 
Instead of seeking merely to get 
ahead by obeying the arbitrary 
whims of someone who is set over 
him by an official position, the pro
fessional student seeks to join the 
community of his profession. He 
defers to the judgment of his tea
chers because they are colleagues 
who have already achieved in the 
profession.
I point this out because the 
term professional" is used at 
Carnegie Tech for a wide variety 
of things, and not all of them are 
legitimately subsumed under it,
I think its a dangerous miscon
ception to regard professional 
education as a kind of education 
which is practical in the short 
run  that is, which gets the stu
dent fresh out of college into the 
highest-paying job available. Ra
ther, professional education is the 
kind of education which trains the 
individual to grow with his profes
sion, In many cases, his profes
sion  be it music or electro
nics  is far ahead of the sophis
tication of those who consume his 
output  his audience, or perhaps 
his employer.
And so a high - grade profes
sional institution like Carnegie 
Tech find itself not attempting 
to train many of its students to 
get a good first job but rather 
to be particularly well qualified 
for promotion ten or twenty years 
later on.
What is the relationship between 
professionalism and apathy on the 
Carnegie Tech campus?
There is alleged to be some
thing at Carnegie Tech called
apathy." But apathy" is not so 
simple or well-defined a problem 
as it might seem. Originally, apa
thy meant unconsciousness. Most 
people at Carnegie Tech are not 
quite that cynical. However, within 
the list of dictionary meanings, 
is a definition which says some
thing to the effect that, apathy 
is a state of lack of interest in 
something which someone else 
finds exciting." Im sure this is 
true in some ways of at least some 
people at Carnegie Tech.
In part, its true because Car
negie Tech is a professional 
school. A painter is not necess
arily excited by the beauty of a mathematical proof, nor is a ma
thematician necessarily excited by 
a new way of using color. One 
might, I suppose, argue that a 
mans education is somewhat 
lacking if he is unable to appre
ciate elementary mathematical 
proofs, or if he is never able to 
enjoy a painting. But obviously not 
every mathamatician can be ex
pected to have  or should have  
the high level of sophistication 
which would cause him to be in
trigued by the things which excite 
professional painters the most.
On the other hand, I think a very 
good argument could be made that 
what we call apathy at Carnegie 
Tech is a consequence of the fact 
that our students are not suffi
ciently professionalized. Few 
chemists are professionally qua
lified musicians, although some 
are. But few really good chemists 
are uninterested in music, and un
acquainted with musicians. Simi
larly, few musicians f . . I men
tioned before that beyond the pro
fessional community is the com
munity of educated men. The real
ly educated musician and the real
ly educated chemist are mem
bers of the same community. They 
are not dilitants but as truly 
professional persons they have an 
interest in other professions.
If a Carnegie Tech education 
were more professional, dramats 
would talk to engineers. Students 
of architecture, history, mecha
nical engineering, and biology 
would be discussing the physical 
and social environment of the Car
negie Tech campus and how it 
could be improved. These things 
would be important to them pro
fessionally because they would be 
important to them personally  
and they would be important to the 
students personally because they 
would be important to them pro
fessionally.
So, as I see it, there are two 
entirely possible reasons for apa
thy at Carnegie Tech. Both, per
haps, are true. But it seems to me 
that they have very different im
plications. Carnegie Tech is not 
held together by a sequence of 
pep-rallies and spring carnivals. 
While those who run the pep-rallies and spring carnivals may con
sider this unfortunate, the first 
hypothesis suggests that it is, in 
fact, simply a consequence of the 
schools status as a high-level 
professional institution.
A worse school, in which it is 
not reasonable to expect the ma
jority of students to be-in any 
at all-members of the profession
al community, has no other least 
commom denominator than the 
kinds of activities called colle
giate." Unfortunately (sic), this 
kind of activity is quickly becom
ing obsolete in every college In the 
country. It hardly seems reason
able to regret that Carnegie Tech 
is not such a crummy school that 
its only community activities are 
cheering for the football team.
The other reason for apathy, 
however  that people are not 
committed to or involved with 
their professions  implies the 
students dont regard themselves 
as members of a professional
community and don't hope to be
come members of that communi
ty; that the faculty gives them no 
encouragement, and neither does 
the Administration,
Pm not sure whether this is 
true of Carnegie Tech, It seems 
to me that, if true, it is rather 
unfortunate. It means that Car
negie Tech is not a professional 
school at all, but rather a voca
tional school. I think, perhaps its 
true more in some parts of Car
negie Tech than it is in others.
Both the drama department and 
the computer center, for exam
ple, look to me like professional 
sub-communities. On the other 
hand, an observer might remark 
that even these parts of Carnegie 
Tech have certain properties of 
vocational training: students, en
couraged by their faculties, appear 
to be in such godawful hurry to 
cram in competence in their ma
jor field that they have neither the 
time nor the motivation to achieve 
membership in the broader pro
fessional and intellectual commu
nity.
It is absurd, of course, to try 
to allocate blame for this state 
of affairs  first of all, because 
it is not unique to Carnegie Tech, 
One could blame the students who 
are, for the most part, more de
dicated to their careers than they 
are to achievement in their cho
sen field.
One could also say that the fa
culty members are at least equal
ly at fault, because they dont be
have like colleagues to their stu
dents. (At least, I very rarely see 
faculty drinking beer with under
graduates.) And I suppose that one 
could point to the administra
tion" although, I think that such an 
accusation would be misleading. 
The administration is not one man, 
not two men, not the sum of all 
the non-academic employees at 
Carnegie Tech, but a very large 
group Including elements such as 
trustees, alumni, the various fa
culties, and not the least, students.
Is husband - hunting a relevant 
excuse for getting a college edu
cation?
There is a cliche about girls 
coming to college to find a hus
band. I think this is true; it's just 
inaccurate. It would be better 
to say the girls come to college 
to find a future  as do men. A 
relatively small proportion of stu
dents hope to spend all of their 
lives in the ivory tower. Some 
can't wait all of their lives in 
the ivory tower. Some can't wait 
to raise a family, others to save 
the world through political action, 
still others to make great scienti
fic or artistic achievements.
What role can college play in 
helping the student to grow up?'
Think, for a minute, how much 
there is for college to liberate its 
students from. Just to get into col
lege, a student has to be pretty 
damn docile. He has to have learn
ed to get along with arbitrary tea
chers who never take him serious
ly, and to give them what they want 
in exchange for grades and special 
attention, etc. He has to learn to 
define himself as child, and to de
fer to the judgments  frequent
ly wrong ones  of omniscient 
adults. He has had to learn to hold 
down his momentary feelings and 
impulses and to live in hope that if 
he is quiet enough and good enough 
some day he will be promoted to a 
big, powerful grown - up man and 
then he will live happily ever af
ter.
Such behavior is fine for small 
children. And It's somewhat ac
ceptable for adults in non-profes
sional positions. But It does not 
hold for the professional person.
The professional person must 
trust his own judgment, even when 
it comes in conflict with authority. 
For him, lt is no longer true that
mother knows best, or that the boss 
knows best. Nor is it entirely true 
that those in authority really con
trol their formal subordinates. ^
On closer examination, lt turns 
out that authority is a very com
plex mechanism up there some
where, and that the authorities are 
split among themselves. A sen
sible subordinate can usually find 
support for his own position within 
the structure of authority, if only 
he does not think like a child and 
assume that authority is a mono
lithic, single entity. ^
Unfortunately, by the time a child 
has been subjected to twelve years 
of brainwashing, he must be an 
extraordinary person not to have 
the mind of a slave. Professional 
education, at its Utopian best, 
would do something about that.
It would show students that they 
have allies against arbitrary au
thority, This may be very impor
tant for some adolescents, who 4 
are extremely concerned with their 
rebellion against authorities of all 
sorts.
And I think its somewhat more 
accurate to think of the profes
sional school as allied with the 
adolescent against his parents than 
the other way around. But its not 
clear what colleges do this very 
well. Take Carnegie Tech, for ex
amplesometimes, when I talk to t 
students, I get the impression that 
they think that the school is run 
by an unsympathetic administra
tion which spends all of its time 
keeping elaborate records of its 
mistakes. This isnt true.
The most powerful forces in 
the Administration are, in fact, 
intensely concerned with making 
the college experiences as profi- g 
table as possible for undergrad- * 
uates, and even as pleasant as pos
sible  given that there is pro
fitability. And this by no means 
implies that it wants students to 
suffer for their own good." Ad
ministrative decisions at Carne
gie Tech, as in all quality schools, 
involve the taking into account of 
a wide variety of positions, in
cluding where it is accessible" g 
to the positions of the students.
But when I read the Tartan, or 
Student Congress minutes, it be
comes clear that students are 
spending their time expressing 
their opinions on professionally 
irrelevant matters. For this rea
son, of course, those who claim 
to speak for the students rarely 
speak for any but a small propor
tion of student activities. g
I don't think students at Car
negie Tech realize that there is 
practically no change in the insti
tution they could not get made 
if they all got together and ask
ed for it. Do you want to abolish 
grades? Do you want co-educational dormitories? A new theater 
building? A liberal arts college 
for men? Request these things. 
Ask for the^ as a student body, q 
don't delegate your responsibi
lity to a small elite group of stu
dent leaders."
And ask only for things which 
are professionally relevant. A 
bowling alley, or the allocation for 
more resources for athletic scho
larships, are not professionally 
relevant, and the majority or stu
dents don't give a damn. Nor do 
the majority of students have much  
faith in their so-called representa
tives.
They simply do not believe, for 
example, that Student Congress has 
any power in the Administration of 
Carnegie Tech. At the moment, this 
is very largely true, though through 
no fault of other elements of the 
Administration. It is true because 
radical" student demands are 
universally so trivial and professlonally irrelevant that neither 
students, In general, not other ele
ments of the administration care.

ASW Considers Renovations 
In MG Resident Facilities
The Association of Women Students recently acted 
on two suggestions offered by Morewood residents. The first concerned lighting in the dormitory and a sug
gestion that 150 watt light bulbs be made available, 
and the second, involved work facilities for residents 
in painting and design.
The Association initiated a study 
to see if wiring in the old towers 
and E tower could handle a high
er wattage; and if the old tower 
desk lamps could be replaced. It 
was found that a wiring plan of the 
old building is non-existent and 
higher watt bulbs in E tower will 
not fit into the built-in frames. 
A study is now under way in refe
rence to getting new desk lamps.
The second motion suggested 
was that work space be provided 
in the dorm for residents in paint
ing and design. This would enable 
P&Ds to keep all their equip
ment In one place. After studying 
their proposal, the association de
cided that work space provided in 
the fine Arts building is sufficient. 
However, a proposal to extend 
P&D hours is being studied by 
Virginia B. Milligan, dean of wom
en, and Norman L. Rice, dean of 
the College of Fine Arts. It is also 
possible that a work area may be 
provided in the Dorm for fresh
man in P & Ds who do not have 
individual work space in the Fine 
Arts Building.

Joan Biordi and Edward J. 
Kramer -- among 66 selected from 
395 applicants  will begin their 
fellowship work atCambridgeUni
versity, England, after completing 
doctorates here.
Miss Biordi, whose field is phy

at Carnegie Tech. Kramer did his 
undergraduate work in chemical 
engineering at Cornell University.
The NATO fellowship program 
was begun in 1959 in the belief 
that full development of science 
and technology is essential to the 
culture, economy, strength and 
welfare of the Atlantic commun
ity. At the request of the State 
Department, the fellowship pro

Tartans Beat Down Grove City; 
Overmatched Against Penn State
Techs basketball team, which played last night at Western Reserve, finished 
a tough four-game home stand last weekend with two wins and two losses for an 
overall season record of five and three.
After outscoring a rough-and-tumble Grove City team 93 to 84 last Thursday 
night, the Tartans dropped a 72-52 game on Saturday afternoon to powerful 
Penn State.
Before Christmas vacation the Tartans had beaten Geneva 81-71 in front of 
a huge homecoming crowd in Skibo Gym, then lost 73-62 to Ohio Wesleyan on

Foul Festival
Sixty fouls were called in the 
hard-hitting Grove City game, in
cluding almost every imaginable 
personal foul except clipping. Four 
men on each side fouled out, and so 
many infractions were committed 
in the closing seconds that it took 
nearly 15 minutes to get in the 
last minute of playing time.
Ray Morrison, high scorer in 
the game with 24, hit three straight
Jeff Kalin (with ball) scored 22 
points, but Tech couldn't penetrate 
State's zone defense.
Jump shots to give Tech a 27-17 
lead midway in the first half. But 
the Grovers caught up when, with 
Kalin already on the bench with 
three fouls, Mark Lang drew three 
in just 40 seconds and also left 
the game.
Down 41*39 at halftime, the Tar
tans jumped off to a 52-46 lead at 
the start of the second half and
led by three to six points most of 
the way thereafter except for one 
period when GC regained the lead 
58-55. Brown, Kalin and Lang 
were all in foul trouble and had 
to move with caution under the 
boards, or Tech might have pull
ed away.
Burdett, who played with a foot
ball mouthpiece after catching an 
elbow in the teeth, joined these 
three in fouling out late in the sec
ond half. GCs six-foot-six star 
Jeff Claypool also fouled out, 
though, and coach Mel Cratsley 
was able to settle back and beam 
with delight as his Tartans opened 
a 10-point margin in the final min
utes.
Grove City held the edge in re
bounds, but Tech shot a hot 55 
per cent from the field with five 
men in double figures. Meanwhile, 
the Tartans forced the Grovers in
to frequent bad shots, especially 
near the end when they were try
ing to catch up.
Lions Too Much
Last year Penn State went to 
the NCAA championship tourna
ment before finally losing to a 
Princeton team that finished third 
in the nation, and graduation appa
rently has not hurt the Lions. 
Fresh from winning the Gator 
Bowl Tourney championship in 
Florida, and including wins over 
such teams as Maryland and 
North Carolina State, in their 8 
and 2 record they held Tech to 
19 points in the first half with 
their vaunted zone defense and 
coasted to a 72-52 win.
Tech's Jeff Kalin, however, led 
all scorers in the game with 22 
points. Kalin initiated a secondhalf rally that brought the Tar
tans from 26 points behind to 10 
points at 54-44. At this point stage 
Penn State coach John Egli call
ed a time out to regroup his for
ces, and the Lions moved on to 
their final margin of victory.
Jim Brown was harrassed in the 
second half by States All-Ameri
ca candidate Carver Clinton and
-
managed only seven points be
fore fouling out. In all, Tech just 
couldnt work the ball inside.
2 Games After Exams:
Tech plays twice at home over 
semester break: against Allegheny 
on Wednesday, January 26, at 8:15 
p^m.j and against St. Vincent on 
Saturday, January 29 and at 2;30

V AFl ainf
Claude Sofields Tech swimming 
team, trying to even its season 
record at 2 wins and 2 losses, 
suffered a heartbreaking 55-40 
defeat at the hands of Bethany 
last Saturday.
Coach Sofield had expressed op
timism towards the Bethany meet 
but had said that to win, Tech 
must take first place in all the 
freestyle events. However, Be
thany took first place in the 200- 
and 500-yard freestyle, and the 
points from these events enabled 
them to win.
Pete Hutter took first place 
in the 60- and 100-yard freestyle 
events, setting a new pool record 
of 53.3 seconds in the latter. 
Tech swimmers, John Perry, Les 
Hough, Steve Yahr, and Hutter al
so took first place in the 400- 
yard freestyle relay.
More team points were accu
mulated for Tech by Biglow who 
took first in the 160-yard indi
vidual medley and by Zimmer
man, who took first place in div
ing.
On Wednesday, December 16,
the Tartans staged a comeback in 
their home pool to defeat Westmin
ster 55 to 40 for their first vic
tory. This meet marked also the 
personal comeback of Pete Hutter, 
who had been recovering from a 
wrist injury. Hutter took first 
place in the 50- and 100-yard free
style and in the 50 his time was 
23.6, just 3/10 of a second off the 
Tech pool record. Geary Andrews 
won the 200- and 500-yard free
style, and freshman Stuart Kennison won first in diving.
Tech lost its first two meets 
of the year by wide margins to 
strong opponents, 67-26 to Grove 
City and 73-21 to West Virginia. 
Today the team is at home against 
W.&J. at 4:30 p.m. in the last 
meet till next semester.
InV :3t dn IifJ
Although there are promising 
freshman on the team, such as 
Kenniston and Bill Johnson, there 
is a lack of experienced swim
mers. Sofield would like to see 
swimmers who have had high 
school experience come out for 
practice.
