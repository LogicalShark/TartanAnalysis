According to Gina, the Super

tion of the Beaux-Arts Ball  
an elaborate and elegant party.
The success of the masque
rade ball will be dependent upon 
the peoples willingness to active

agree.

ly the front entrance will be open
ed at 9 p.m. for Superball.

Gina and Fred have extended the 
following invitation: The Beaux 
Arts Ball Committee would like 
to take this last opportunity to in
vite All Fine Arts to purchase 
tickets today for Superball. It will 
be an incredible spectacle:
Faster than a Western ballot 
skillet. . . More tasteful than a 
Kosher olive . . . Able to rock 
Tech chilluns with a single sound 
. . . And who, disguised as Arts 
Ball, super-powered students from 
Tech Fine Arts, stage a never end
ing party with food, dance, bliss, 
on artisans pay.
Armed Forces Hold 
Information Day
An Armed Forces Information 
Day will be held in the Hunt Ar
mory in East Liberty from 2 to 
10 p.m. on Saturday, March 18.
The purpose of the session, 
according to Marine Corps Cap
tain T.L. Cusick, chairman of the 
sponsoring committee, is to in
form the public of the programs 
and opportunities available in the 
services.
Representatives of the branch
es of the armed forces will be 
available to explain the numerous 
programs offered by their respec
tive services. Personnel will be 
present from service academies, 
ROTC, National Guard, Selective 
Service, and the Labor Depart
ment as well as from the Army, 
Navy, Marine Corps, and Air 
Force.
Captain Cnsick cammented that 
the pragram's primary pnrpase 
was infarmatian rather than 
recrnitment.
Orientation Committee Aims 
At Creating Awareness
Bernie Dabraski, saphamare, mnsic, has been appainted chairman af the fresh
man arientatian cammittee by the Execntive Canncir af stndent gavernment.
Bab Bagart, jnniar, erectricar engineering, was named assistant chairman, and 
Dave Artman, jnniar, math, treasnrer af the cammittee.
The cammittee aims at creating an acnte awareness an the part af the fresh
men af campns activities. It feers that freshmen shanrd have the appartnnity 
ta see as mnch as passibre within a week.
them. But based on the experience 
of the Korean War when similar 
tests were given, more than half 
of the 800,000 young men deferred 
because they are in college are ex
pected to take them.
During the Korean War, good 
students took the test feeling they 
could make good grades and thus 
have another reason for deferment. 
Poorer students took them hoping 
to make grades that would better 
their chances.
The examination will not be the 
only factor in determining whe
ther a student is deferred. He 
must be a full-time student mak
ing satisfactory progress and 
local boards also can consider his 
class standing.
Student can take the test only 
once. The scores will affect de
ferments for graduate, as well 
as undergraduate work.
Men Wha Wish Ta Stay 
Obriged Ta Take Exams
On Aprir 1 pasters annanncing the Serective Service 
Carrege Qnarificatian Test (SSCQT) wirr ga np arr aver 
the natian. 
The pasters wirr be directed ta draft-age men wha 
want ta enter ar remain in carrege next farr.
Grades made on this test will 
be one of the yardsticks local 
draft boards can use to deter
mine whether college students 
are to be deferred.
Local Board Advice
The posters will be displayed in 
colleges, high schools, post of
fices and other public buildings.
See Editorial, Page 4
They will direct those wish
ing to take the tests to any local 
draft board  nof necessarily 
the one with which they are re
gistered  for details.
At the draft board they will be 
given a packet containing:
 A card for the student to 
fill out with his name, ad
dress, and when and where 
he would like to take the 
test.
 An envelope in which he 
mails the card to Science 
Research Associates of 
Chicago, the firm -giving 
the tests. This card must be 
mailed before April 23.
Test Times Okayed
When the card reaches Science 
Research Associates, the firm will 
note the students requested sched
ule and either approve it or give 
an alternate examination time or 
place. It is believed that in most 
cases the Students requested 
schedule can be met.
The card is then mailed back to 
the student and he uses it as his 
admission card to the examina
tions.
The tests will be given through
out the nation on May 14, May 21, 
and June 3.
Selective Service officials think 
as many as one million young men 
may take the tests. If so, this will 
be the largest single test ever 
given in the United States within a 
similar time period.
1200 Locations Picked
The test will be given at more 
than 1200 locations in the 50 stat
es, the District of Columbia, the 
Canal Zone and Puerto Rico.
Science Research Associates, 
low bidder on a contract to give 
the tests, will prepare the ques
tions, hire people to give the tests 
and monitor them, grade the 
papers and forward the results 
of local draft boards.
Neither Serective Service nar 
carreges wirr have anything ta da 
with giving the tests.

Cnrfews End
In an administrative meeting 
held last Wednesday, March 9, it 
was decided that all junior and 
senior women, regardless of 
factor, will not be subject to cur
few regulations.
Parental permission, however, 
will be necessary for eligible wo
men to obtain no curfew.
Permission slips are now avail
able for juniors and seniors at the 
Morewood Main desk. The par
ents of sophomores will receive 
notification and permission slips 
before the fall semester begins.
Final decisions regarding regul
ations for Colonial Manor and Etower apartment residents have 
not yet been reached.
Thistle Sales
The 1966 Thistle sales will be
gin on campus on Monday, March 
21. The yearbooks may be order
ed from campus salesmen.
Additional salesmen are need
ed to take Thistle orders. Stu
dents who sell twenty orders will 
receive a free yearbook, or a re
duction in price on a 1966 Hiistle 
by selling five orders or more.
Interested stndents shanrd can
tact Jahn Harrisan in care af 
the Thistre, Bax 122, Campns Mair, 
ar carr 441-9956.
To acquaint freshmen with the 
various departments on campus, 
lectures and other activities will 
be offered describing the functions 
and programs of individual depart
ments.
Exhibits of the work in the var
ious schools should be made avail
able to the freshmen to further re
late them to the workings of the 
university. The program will also 
strive to stimulate a greater in
volvement of the faculty with the in
coming class. This will be satis
fied in part through faculty - stu
dent seminars.
The orientation committee ex
pects to develop an effective coun
seling program for freshmen. The 
program will include training ses
sions for counselors in the dorms, 
specifically for orientation week. 
The counselors will be asked to 
encourage and acquaint freshmen 
with the opportunities offered them 
during the orientation week and 
throughout their careers at Car
negie Tech.
Recreational activities included 
in orientation week will emphasize 
variety. Their appeal will attempt 
to include all students in the ac
tivities. However, the committee 
feels that students should explore 
the entire university without creat
ing the impression of a purely 
social existence at Carnegie Tech.
The aim also of the committee 
is to create a class unity among 
the freshmen, making them aware 
not only of their new environment 
but also of one another.
The committee would like the 
functions of the orientation pro
gram to go beyond the orientation 
week itself, and to extend into the 
school year when freshmen face si
tuations that they cannot handle 
alone.
The success of the program is 
dependent upon the enthusiasm ge
nerated by the members of the 
orientation committee.
Individuals interested in con
tributing their ideas and efforts 
to the orientation week program 
should file an application with Ber
nie Dobroski, 5202 Woodlawn 
Place, Pittsburgh, Pa., in care of 
the Skibo information desk.
The application must include 
name, major, year, activities, and 
an outline of objectives for the 
orientation committee.
Answers to these questions 
would be appreciated: what should 
orientation week fulfill? How 
should it benefit freshmen? What 
means should be used to acquaint 
freshmen with Carnegie Tech and 
its purposes?

Imminent Service
Dnring the past few years, the passibirity af the 
draft has certainry raamed mnch rarger in the rives 
af mare carrege stndents than it had previansry. The 
war in tietnam and its cantinned escaratian with the 
cancamitant passibirity af persanar invarvement in a

Ta many freshmen and saphamares, and perhaps 
even ta jnniars and seniars, mast af wham naw pas

when they wirr be reqnired ta fnrfirr a miritary abri

schaar, may werr be canfranted by their racar baards 
with demands far miritary service. Snch individnars 
wha, facing that ance seemingry distant praspect 
which has naw became an nrgent rearity, and having

their miritary abrigatians, can exert na cantrar aver 
their fntnre experiences in the miritary. They have 
rittre chaice bnt ta enter that branch af the service 
specified by their baard.
The qnestian then arises, haw can stndents be kept 
mare fnrry infarmed abant patentiar arternatives ta

individnar. Stndents mnst face rearisticarry the immi

serves infarmed abant arternatives farms af service 
by farrawing newspapers, magazines and ather periad
icars. Ta a rarge extent, hawever, the bnrden rests 
with Carnegie Tech. In ane respect, the schaar has 
execnted this respansibirity by snpprying the Tartan 
with infarmatian and by encanraging stndents ta read 
the city newspapers and ather periadicars. Nanetheress 
there is far mare which can and certainry shanrd be

From The Middle Of The Bus'1
By Michael Malakoff
Registration
We had a Freedom Rally at our 
office on Sunday. Mrs. Anne Devine, a Mississippi Negro who is 
trying to become a representative 
to the U. S. Congress, was one of 
the speakers. Although she col
lected 300 signatures of register
ed voters in the 4th Congressional 
District, the required number to 
run, the State authorities refused 
to place her name on the ballot. 
This is in direct violation of the 
Mississippi constitution and is a 
federal offense.
Yet, what has our Government 
done? The present congressmen 
still maintain their seats. This 
is what the Freedom Democratic 
Party is fighting. Last August, 
1964, the Democratic Party ack
nowledged this injustice by offer
ing the MFDP two of Mississippis 
five seats at the convention, the 
MFDP refused.
Should we compromise with in
justice especially when it is such 
a clear violation of our laws? We 
do. There were about 150 people 
at the rally. The police blocked 
the road preventing people from 
coming in.
Other police came onto the prop
erty (this is trespassing) and start
ed taking pictures of the others 
present. This frightened people. 
They feared for their homes, their 
families, and their jobs. They knew 
what had happened to their neigh
bors that had become involved. 
When the police were asked to 
leave and informed that they were 
trespassing, they cussed at us and 
continued to take pictures.
Mr. X, one of the local citizens, 
was arrested and released on$200 
bond. This is the law that civil 
righters faced in Mississippi. As 
one cannot appeal to the law for 
justice, who can one appeal to?
This is why violence occurs in 
the South, for the white man knows 
he can beat up or even kill a 
Negro and no jury will indict him. 
This has been seen a number of 
times. The Goodman, Shwerner, 
Chaney and Mrs. Liuzzos cases 
are some of the outstanding ex
amples of this. These injustices 
occur in our so-called democracy 
every day.
On Monday, I again carried peo- * 
pie to the Courthouse in Decatur to 
register to vote. About 20 Negroes 
a day were registering. Our can
vassing was paying off. This was 
partly because of the new form 
which simply requires ones name, 
address, and age along with other 
basic questions. The old test asked 
people to copy and interpret parts 
of the Constitution at the discretion 
of the registrar. Naturally very ' 
few Negroes, nor many whites, or 
even college graduates, if required 
to interpret the same parts, would 
be registered.
It was eight miles to the court
house. It is difficult to relate the 
fears of the people who were taking 
this step to register. Tensions 
mounted as one got closer. In the 
back of everyones mind, there was 
the thought of potential violence. *
At the courthouse, white people 
gathered as we registered. There 
was name calling but no serious 
incident. There was a quiet hap
piness as we returned to Newton.
Still, as cars approached and 
passed everyones heart beat a 
little faster. Most counties in Mis
sissippi were not using this new 
form. Some counties still required 
a 2-week waiting period between 1 
the time you registered.
During this time, they published 
your name in the local newspaper. 
Consequently, many Negroes had 
their minds changed for them dur
ing this period. We were more 
fortunate in Newton, yet, the ugli
ness and the differences of schools, 
roads, eating facilities, and above 
all, the fear brought out by con
ditions of inequality are quite ap
parent.
Ideas Needed
Next years YM- YWCA program 
is in need of students suggestions 
on the needs of the Carnegie Tech 
campus and how to attain them.
Creativity could win one of three 
prizes ($25, $15, and $10,) being 
offered for the top three ideas. 
Ideas should be brought to the Of
fice of Religious Affairs, Skibo 
room 57.

Nature Of The University
Tech Helps To Improve 
Secondary School Education
In agreement with its edncatianar phirasaphy, Carnegie Tech is naw caape
rating with the Pittsbnrgh secandary schaars in a nnmber af prajects.
The earriest af the hnmanities prajects is the Advanced Pracement Pra
gram, which was begnn in 1959. Thrangh this pragram Carnegie Tech facnrty 
and secandary schaar teachers deveraped carrege rever canrses in Engrish 
and histary far abre carrege-bannd high schaar stndents. Over ane hnndred and 
fifty secandary schaar teachers have attended ane-manth caaperative snmmer institntes at Carnegie Tech.
In 1962 the Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare granted the 
school $220,000 to establish a Cur
riculum Development Center in 
English, largely as a result of the 
success of the A, P. P. This pro
gram, better known as Project 
English, aims to develop as inte
grated and sequential curriculum 
in languages, composition, and li
terature for 10th, 11th, and 12th 
grade high school students who 
are planning on going to college. 
During the summer Carnegie 
Tech English faculty and English 
teachers from five area high 
schools decide on the composition 
of the course; the following year 
the courses are taught by the tea
chers. The courses are then re
vised and corrected and a new 
course developed. A long range 
goal of the program is the es
tablishment of a set of standards 
for high school English which can 
be used to increase the effective
ness of college freshman English 
courses.
Social Studies 
The next year Carnegie Tech 
was awarded another Curriculum 
Development Center in the field of 
Social Studies. This program for 
9th through 12th graders emphasiz
es the mode of inquiry and induc
tive learning. Like Project Eng
lish, Project Social Studies takes 
a sequential and cumulative view 
of the yearly courses. By using 
control groups in the five Pitts
burgh high schools where the new
ly-developed programs are being 
taught, co-directors John Gook and 
Edwin Fenton hope to have a pre
cise evalation of the program.
Math and Science 
In the fields of math and sci
ence, the Carnegie Tech facul
ty has been working with the sec
ondary schools since 1951, often 
without any outside support. More 
recently, secondary schoolteach
ers have been prepared to teach 
the physics course designed by the 
Physical Sciences Study Com
mittee at Carnegie Tech. And, 
since 1963, both basic and advan
ced courses have been develop
ed for able students in the fields 
of biology, chemistry and mathe
matics.
Three college professors and 
three high school teachers adapt
ed and developed these biology 
chemistry, and math programs 
during the spring of 1963.
Fine Arts 
In 1964 a program very similar 
to Projects English and Social 
Studies was proposed for Fine 
Arts. Its objectives are to de
velop a 5 year course in the fine 
arts for able students, to relate 
these fine arts to other parts of 
the secondary school curriculum, 
and to find ways to prepare teach
ers for the new curriculum.
Three Carnegie Tech faculty 
members and three secondary 
school teachers will develop and 
later teach the Project, which will 
also be evaluated by using control 
groups.
Economics 
The newest of the projects is a 
National Education Defense Act 
grant for a summer institute in 
Economics. 'Hiirty high school tea
chers from throughout the coun
try will attend a six week insti
tute which will concentrate on up
dating their knowledge of econo
mics.
A morning course in Economic 
Analysis and Policy will be taught; 
the afternoon sessions will introTroika

Every Days A Holiday
Last week a great patron of the 
arts, Ray Wolfarth, commissioned 
a mural for his posh watering 
place, The Holiday Bar, Mem
bers of the Carnegie Tech graphics 
and painting departments and in
terested onlookers gathered at 
noon to rough out the design.
Shortly thereafter the cobalt 
blue, alizarin crimson, Canadian 
Club, cadmium yellow, Michelob, 
and Stoneys began to glow. Your 
reporters, ever on top of the news, 
caught Ray in a back booth and over 
a pitcher of beer took the opportu
nity to interview a man who has 
become Tech legend. Our photog
rapher caught the days activities 
and the following interview at a 
high point...
Troika: Ray, You've become a 
campus institution, known and 
loved by all. How long have you 
been dispensing good cheer? * .
Ray: Since 1955. It used to be 
55% Tech students and 45% Pitt. 
Since I moved around the corner 
3-1/2 years ago, it's 99% Tech.
Troika: In all these years as 
acting confessor to Carnegie Tech 
what philosophy of life have you 
evolved which you might recom
mend to our readers?
Ray: There's one solution to the 
problem. My dad always told me 
there's one solution to every prob
lem: Booze.
Troika: On what do you base your 
philosophy?
Ray: Because I drink. Pm the 
biggest alcoholic on the Tech 
campus.
Troika: Where does love fit into 
your philosophy?
Ray: When you have time. I love 
my wife and four children, I love 
myself. Nobody else does, except 
my wife. Thank God,
Troika: On another subject, any 
comment on the closing of "The 
Greeks,"
Ray: No comment except it's
duce new teaching materials and 
techniques.
With these programs Carnegie 
Tech re-emphasizes its commit
ment to the community and the 
student. By reaffirming its active 
interest in better prepared sec
ondary school students, Carnegie 
Tech attempts to lay the founda
tion, not only for the learning 
experience of college, but for a 
process of learning after grad
uation, too.
really a sad, sad thing.
Troika: What about the present 
Pennsylvania liquor laws?
Ray: I think the current law as 
it may be has really got to be re
vised to fit the current needs of to
day's population.
Troika: In the light of the demise 
of several private institutions in 
the Oakland area, is there any 
chance that The Holiday will be
come state related,* in the near 
future?
Ray: Well, I've been talking to 
Governor Scranton and Bill told 
me if we could sit down we might 
be able to work it out.
Troika: How do you see the 
future of The Holiday?
Ray: I hope to be in operation 
when you bring your children to eat 
and drink in The Holiday. But not 
when they're underage because Til 
card them.
Troika: Any comments on drink
ing habits of Tech students?
Ray: Carnegie Tech students 
have the best drinking habits of 
any university in the country. Car
negie Tech gives you all their ag
gravations I've been told, but I'd 
say 99% of the real gentlemen or 
real ladies, whatsoever the case 
may be, come from Tech. This is 
one aggravation I can take every 
day. All kidding aside, very, very, 
very rarely do you ever have trou
ble with Carnegie Tech. When my 
sons are old enough, I'd feel very 
proud in my own right if they 
could go to Carnegie Tech.
Troika: Anything else?
Ray: People say kids today are 
hard to handle. How different are 
kids today than they were when 
their dads and mothers were young. 
They're no different. Kids aren't 
any different today. Times are 
different today. Youve got to give 
them a chance. Youve got to give 
them a little hope. The whole coun
trys future rests on kids.

Since Intramural Night, which 
is traditionally an all-school event, 
does not end until 10, it was neces

as joint-all-school so that the 
Ball could start at nine.
Although the ball does not end at 
10 p.m,, the restrictions on other 
activities will be lifted at that 
time.
The main opposition to this rul

that his fraternity be exempted 
from all-school restrictions since 
they had scheduled a mixer for that

light were telephone charges and 
new locks for downstairs Sklbo 
rooms. Student Congress was 
charged $66,12 for telephone calls

Next year MMCC students will 
have stronger departments of so
ciology and anthropology. Dean 
Steinberg hopes the near future 
will also bring an expansion of 
the philosophy department. To 
strengthen these departments 
Margaret Morrison has received 
$60,000 from the Scaife family to 
aid in obtaining the necessary 
professors.
These funds will also be used 
for research for the role of the 
educated woman in American so
ciety.
Another field to be expanded 
will be graduate work. Now of
fered is a masters degree in Eng
lish, natural sciences, home eco
nomics and history. Carnegie 
Tech has received fifteen fellow
ships in history from the govern
ment
Dean Steinberg said, Graduate 
work in Margaret Morrison will 
be strengthened. The speed de
pends upon financial support and 
faculty.
The sophomore and senior sem
inar programs were mentioned.
Dean Steinberg explained that the 
seminar instructors structure 
their programs individually and 
that these change each year. Dr. 
Beach of the psychology depart
ment, will head a seminar next 
year.
The question was raised as to 
the Administrations views on the 
program to combine classes of the 
five colleges in the Pittsburgh 
area. Would the classes be too 
large and have to revert to a lec
ture form of teaching?
Dean Steinberg answered that if 
we get as many students as we 
send, the program will work. How
ever, if class sizes change then 
action will have to be taken. It 
would be an advantage to use the 
good departments of other uni
versities, but we must maintain 
small classes where there is more 
discussion than lecture.
A few girls are now taking clas
ses at Chatham, but the program 
must be launched slowly. It is easy 
to work with Chatham because 
there, too, the classes are small.
When asked how he felt about the 
new proposed calendar, Dean 
Steinberg answered, Surprising
ly Margaret Morrison faculty feels 
exams are important. The faculty 
of the College of engineering and 
science, however, are divided in 
their opinion. The question is yet 
to be resolved.
Registration this year was high
ly unsuccessful. A possibility to 
alleviate the situation was recom
mended by the dean to register 
between Christmas vacation and 
semester finals, on a special day 
set aside for this. This way, class 
time would not be lost.
A main reason for the registra
tion shuffle was the new minor 
program for E & S students. There

7-3 State For Frosh
No one has been so brash as to 
predict a dynasty of good basket
ball teams at Carnegie Tech over 
the next few years, but it may be 
a sign of the times that this year's 
freshman team won seven out of its
10 games. The Tech frosh, under 
the guidance of junior varsity coach 
Mike Theodore, lost only to Point 
Park Junior College and twice to a 
Pitt squad that is generally regard
ed as the best group of freshmen 
basketball players at that school in 
the last six years.
The improvement of the Tech 
JVs during the season can be 
noted from the fact that they lost 
their first game to Pitt by 66 to 
37, but dropped the second en
counter with the Panther Cubs by a 
much more respectable 84-72 
score. The Point Park loss, in the 
third game of the year, was a 67- 
46 decision.
Basketball Year Closes
Continued from page 8 
At any rate, any improvement 
on this years season would have to 
be a record-breaking year. The 
16 and 6 chart compiled by the Tar
tans was, as the sign in the lobby 
of the gymnasium proclaims, the 
winningest season in Tech his
tory.
A Record After All 
It was previously stated in the 
Tartan that the 1923-24 Tech team 
was the most successful with an
11 and 3 record, but some belated 
research has revealed that the 
record that year was actually 3 and
11, including losses by scores like 
41 to 14.
This years team beat Geneva, 
the champion of the West Penn 
Conference, and Bethany, the

By Fred Stone
The champianship intramnrar basketbarr game taps 
the events at the annnar Intramnrar Night, which 
wirr be herd this Friday evening fram 7 ta 10 P.M. 
at Skiba Gym. This year the cansaratian game, ta 
determine third prace, wirr be Thnrsday night.
The other events at this years 
I.M. Night* are an All - Star 
volleyball game and an exhibition 
table tennis match. Carnegie Tech 
boasts many excellent volleyball 
players, and bringing these men 
together in an all-star game 
should result in an interesting and 
exciting contest. Also, Tech senior 
Venu Chari will play an exhibi
tion ping-pong match against La
rue Brown, who is a nationally 
ranked women player and attends 
Duquesne University.
At the half time of the cham
pionship game, trophies and most 
valuable player awards will be 
presented to the championship 
teams and outstanding individuals 
of all intramural sports complet
ed thus far.
All-Opponent 
Team Elected
Players and coaches of the var
sity basketball team voted for an 
all-opponent team last week and 
selected Carver Clinton of Penn 
State as the best player they fac
ed this year. Clinton, who scor
ed 20 points and had 20 rebounds 
in State's 72-52 win over Tech, 
nosed out Pitts Larry Szykowny 
for the honor in the balloting.
The team of outstanding oppo
nents selected includes; guards -- 
Szykowny and John Fontanella of

several close contests.
Keefer, the smallest starter at 
five-ten, utilized his phenomenal 
jumping ability to play forward. 
He was also the most accurate 
shot on the team with an exotic 
two-hand, over-the-head jump 
shot.
Burdett, a six-one junior, is 
known throughout the district as 
a defensive specialist. When the 
Tartans play man-to-man defense, 
Burdett always covers the oppo
nents most dangerous scorer.
Mark Lang was dubbed the 
poker-faced freshman0 by Pitts
burgh sportswriters because he 
displayed such unusual poise on the 
court for a freshman. He was the 
second leading rebounder, despite 
being shuffled in and out of most 
games and not having much weight 
hes 185 pounds to throw around 
under the boards.
Morrison, along with guard 
Chester Reft and forward Pete 
Ricardella, graduates this year. 
Brown, a sophomore transfer stu
dent from Denison University, has 
used up his only remaining season 
of collegiate eligibility. Browns
absence means that Lang will be 
starting regularly next year. No 
immediate replacement is in sight 
for Morrison. Neil Houser, a fiveten sophomore who frequently sub
bed for him this year, could take 
his place, as could one of the jun
ior varsitys backcourt men. (See 
article on freshman team.)

All Starters Key Man
It is difficult to name any one 
man as indispensable, though, 
since the teams 16 and 6 record 
was due to the consistent perfor
mance of six regular starters:
Kalin, Jim Brown, Ray Morrison,
Don Keefer, Ray Burdett, and Mark 
Lang.
Morrison, a senior guard, fi
nished his career with 950 points 
scored in three years, makii^ 
him the ninth highest scorer in 
Tech history. He was the teams 
leading scorer in each of the three 
seasons he played, and was also 
the principal ball handler and led 
the Tartans fast break.
Brown, at six-foot six, was one 
of the biggest men to ever play 
basketball at Carnegie Tech. Both
ered by injuries and illnesses all 
year, Brown still averaged 12 
points a game and helped pull out

finars. Here is the rnndawn af first-rannd games:
ATO continued its winning ways, 
as they easily trounced the Interns

While both teams shot coldly in 
the first half, BTP gradually pull

take SAE 39-32.
The Civil Hammers got off to a 
big lead by use of their full-court 
press, then proceeded to substitute 
freely in a 61-38 win over the 
Deadbeats.
Grad Physics, last years runnerup, remained undefeated by 
upending BSR 36 to 27.
PKA controlled virtually all the 
defensive rebounds and finished 
strong in the last quarter to beat 
TDP 42-28.
GSIA R opened up with a big 
lead over cold-shooting SN and 
scored an easy 54-44 victory.
GSIA P made up a 12-10 halftime deficit and beat the Hulk 
Howlers 34-26.
In the jag semifinals, the Dorm 
Wipe Outs, trailing 31-21 after 
three quarters, came back to over
