Tech Clarifies Draft 
Policies, Suggestions
Two days remain before the February 10 deadline for 
submission of applications for the Selective Service College 
Qualification Test to be given on three dates this spring. 
As announced in previous Tartans, the test dates are March 
11, March 31, and April 8, 1967. Application forms may be 
picked up from Mrs. Ryan, Selective Service Administrator, 
in Warner Hall 205.
Swank, Young View Qreeks 
In Formal Rush Opener
Earle Swank, Dean of Men, and Dr. Hugh D. Young, physics instructor, opened 
formal fraternity rush last Wednesday with speeches on their views of the Tech fratern
ity system. Before an audience of nearly 300 freshmen in the Skibo Ballroom, Swank 
spoke as a representative of the Administra tion, giving the schools attitudes towards 
fraternities; while Young spoke as a former Tech fraternity man himself, discussing the
personnel advantages of joining a fraternity.
In addition, Mrs. Ryan notes, 
there seems to be some confus
ion concerning the schools poli
cy on Selective Service. At pres
ent, the students rank in class 
and a certification of enroll
ment is sent his local board 
only at the students request.
On the Permit-to-Register form, 
filled out by all students in the 
Fall, the student indicates wheth
er Tech is authorized to inform 
the draft board of his academic 
status, in accordance with selec
tive service procedures. If his 
answer is affirmative, both a cer
tificate of enrollment and rank-inclass forms are automatically sent 
to his local board. If the answer 
is no, or the question was left un
answered, Tech will not send 
either form to the local board.
> However, according to Mrs. 
Ryan, several cases have de
veloped where Tech was not 
authorized by the student to 
release this information, and 
subsequently the student has 
been reclassified 1-A.
Further, Mrs. Ryan states, if 
a student has registered with Se
lective Service since his enroll
ment at Tech, he should report 
his Selective Service number and 
local board address to Mrs. Ryan, 
if he wants his class rank and 
certification of enrollment sent to 
his Local board.
Deferment Guildlines
While each local board is au
tonomous, essentially three guide
lines are used for deferment.
1) Satisfactory progress toward 
a degree: For Tech students, this 
generally means taking 48 to 50 
units per semester, depending on 
study, in order to complete de
gree requirements in the prescrib
ed eight consecutive semesters. 
For architecture students the re
quirements must be met in ten 
consecutive semesters.
2). Rank in class: Seniors plan
ning on graduate study should 
be in the top one-quarter of the 
male graduating class. Juniors, 
llPon successful completion of 
their third year should be in th 
top three quarters of the full-time 
male students enrolled in that 
class. Sophomores, after finishing 
successfully their second year, 
should be in the top two-thirds of 
the full-time male students ir 
their second year. Freshmen in 
tending to enroll as sophomores

The Bureau of Placements has 
been contacted by several firms 
Poking for students for summer 
^ork. Students interested in sum 
mer jobs are invited to visit the 
Placements Office and fill out an 
aPplication card for its sumrr

Outcast Bond Reviews 
Negro Politics, Rights
Julian Bond, a member of the Georgia legislature 
whose right to be seated was recently upheld by the Su
preme Court, spoke here at Tech and at Carnegie Lecture 
Hall last Friday, Feb. 3. Bond had been refused his seat 
three times on grounds of disloyalty, because he supported 
S.N.C.C.s position on the war in Vietnam and because he 
urged young men to seek legal alternatives to military 
service.Highlander Ideas Rejected; 
Plans Costly, Incompatible
The plan to make the Highlander Room into a twolevel recreation room was rejected last week by the Admin
istration as being too expensive and not fitting into plans
for an addition to Skibo.
Rush Events
Pledging Night for freshmen 
undergoing fraternity rush is next 
Monday night, Feb. 13. Four 
events remain on the formal rush 
calendar: dinners tonight and to
morrow night at 5 pm, smokers 
Friday evenings from 7 to 10 pm, 
and parties Saturday from 8 pm 
to 1 am.
The dinners and the smokers 
are coat-an-tie, and the parties 
are casual dress.
Julian Bond, whose Georgia Leg
islature seat was revoked three 
times before Supreme Court back
ing seated him.
Bond spoke briefly to students 
in GSIA auditorium about Negro 
politics in the United States. He 
illustrated the different styles of 
Negro politics that have develop
ed in different parts of the 
country, including the strategies 
cf Northern Negroes, who must 
deal with machine politicians, 
and by Southern Negroes, who 
have traditionally been cut out of 
politics and have difficulty using 
political power effectively. Bond 
concluded his speech by explain(Continued on Page 13)
Tax Refund
Those students who made less 
than $1000 last year while work
ing in Pittsburgh are entitled to 
a refund of the $10 city occupa
tional tax which was deducted 
lrom their salaries,
They should call the Occupa
tion Tax Department at 281-3900 
and Tax Statement (or W2) form, 
must be filed wth the city in or
der for the refund to become ef
fective.
(See editorial, page 4)
Carnegie Tech employees may 
obtain their 1966 W2 forms from 
the Assistant Treasurers Office, 
Warner Hall Concourse.
Students who are working in 
the city this year but plan to be 
elsewhere next year, may ask the 
city for an additional sets of re
fund applications. In Nov. or Dec. 
of 1967 they may contact the Car
negie Tech Payroll Office and 
have their W2 forms mailed to 
the appropriate address.

Senior Photos
Seniors who did not sit for This
tle photos should notify Al Kurz
weil at Sigma Nu immediately.
An estimate written by James 
P. Kerr, superintendent of En
gineering for the Physical Plant 
department, placed the cost of 
the project at $77,000. In his 
recommendation to the Division 
of Student Affairs, Kerr called 
this cost prohibitive consider
ing the magnitude of the project.
George K. Brown, Dean of 
Student Affairs, guessed that 
with an original estimate of 
$77,000, the expenses would 
eventually run in the neighbor
hood of $100,000. An estimate 
of 15 to 20,000, he said, might 
have been acceptable.
Kerr cited the proposed upper 
deck of the new Highlander 
Room as being the part of the 
plan that made it unreasonably 
expensive. Since pool tables were 
to be installed on the upper deck, 
supports for the deck would have 
to be heavier than those for the 
mezzanine of the snack bar. Al
so, since the upper deck was to 
run all the way to the Window 
wall facing the parking lot, the 
air-conditioning and ventilation 
systems for the room would have 
to be extensively reworked.

Thistle Meeting
The photography staff of Techs 
yearbook, the Thistle, will meet 
next Monday, Feb. 13, at 4:30 
pm in Skibo 53. Anyone inter
ested in joining the staff should 
attend this meeting. Old staff 
members are asked to return all 
Tliistle-owned equipment.
Students interested in working 
for the Thistle but not able to at
tend the meeting can leave a 
note, addressed to Stan Sholik, 
photo editor, under the door in 
room 53, telling their names and 
where they can be contacted.
Swank started by establish
ing that the Administration 
does care about the Greeks, 
noting that $2 million of school 
funds have been spent on fra
ternity housing, and that I 
have devoted a major part of 
my concern for men students 
(as Dean of Men) to the fra
ternities.
He said the Administration has 
also expressed interest in the ef
fect of fraternities on academic 
performance, but has found them 
to have little influence on stu
dents grades. The all-fraternity 
average, according to Swank, 
usually deviates from the all
mens average by less than one 
percentage point.
Greeks Important
Finally, Swank gave two rea
sons he thought fraternities were 
important to the academic com
munity. First, they form re
sponsibility to a group and to 
yourself . . to fraternities I give 
far more responsibility for the 
conduct of their own members 
than I do to any other group 
and Im proud of what they do. 
Second, they provide a center 
around which social activity can 
be developed .... they facilitate 
involvement in school activities. 
Also, They do provide food 
and housing that have some 
measure of human dignity and 
warmth in them.
Swank summed up his last 
argument by saying, If we 
didnt have fraternities, we 
would have to set out to create 
social structures of the kind 
that fraternities are.
Dr. Young told about his un
dergraduate days at Tech, and 
how he did mostly bookish 
things at the start of his college 
career. He joined a fraternity be(Continued on Page 4)

Community Comments 
Reflect Student Image
Tartan Executive Editor Sue Attinson surveyed shopoumers 
students, and citizens in Oakland and Shadyside to find out what 
kind of an image Tech students project in the community. This is her report.
According to some members of the Shadyside and Oak-1 
land communities, mode of dress has stereotyped Carnegie 
Tech students  particularly those thought to be artists 
More than one person said: You can look at someone whos
got a beard and long hair and guess that he goes to Tech_
but then, you cant really tell.
The consensus among Carnegie 
Institute librarians, as expressed 
by one who would have prefer
red to study drama at Tech, is 
that Tech students tend to be 
beat and way-out.
Referring to specific customers, 
a young clothing store sales girl 
called Tech taste Rookie, ad
mitting that Tech women are 
usually a little more fashion con
scious than the Chatham girls 
who shun mini skirts for A-line, 
round-collar, cardigan outfits.
Last year, they were a little 
more eccentric in their dress, 
said one middle-aged critic as 
she stood amidst her stock of 
spring shoes. A lot of the boys 
had beards which they dont have

Blow-up is a film about photography. The central character is 
a photographer whose photographs will appear in all the right glossy 
magazines and illustrate all the in places and now people. The ma
jor metaphor of the film is the photographic organ: the camera. The 
film itself is an examination of the relationship between what the 
camera photographs and what the eye sees. What the camera sees 
is reality. What the human eye sees may not be. In Red Desert An
tonioni was probing the meaning and place of machinery and tech
nology in a world of human relationships; in Blow-Up that exam
ination has been taken further into the difference between reality 
and fantasy.

DIRECT FROM ITS RESERVED 
SEAT ENGAGEMENTS!now, she continued. Students 
also had a fancy for funny hats.
Other descriptive comments 
were more caustic. Said a Uni
versity of Pittsburgh under
graduate after purchasing a 
pair of loafers: Most of the 
ones (Tech students) Ive met 
should be thrown in a bath. 
The short-order cook in a pop
ular Shadyside restaurant/bar 
voiced a similar opinion. Basic
ally, you can tell all fine arts 
studentsnot engineersbecause 
oi their filth. The young man, 
who claimed to be a grade-school 
dropout, spoke at length: They 
feel its elite to be dirty . . . suf
fering until the next paycheck 
comes in. He was full of praise 
for the well-rounded engineer
ing students and that small 
group of good students that keeps 
the schools standards up. With 
regard to the women, it annoyed 
him that they could be so open, 
in their discussions with strang
ers.
Women Look Like Men?
Carnegie Tech women try too 
hard to look like men, complain
ed a Pitt undergraduate who 
worked part-time in a mens 
store. He pointed to navy surplus 
bell-bottoms as being especially 
unattractive and called sloppy 
the men with paint all over their 
pants.
A group of Pitt students sit
ting in the Towers gave this 
analysis: At every school 
there is an image. Pitts image 
is: black socks or no socks, loaf
ers, short hair brushed lightly.
. . . Techs image is: long hair, 
beards, rimless glasses, boots, 
pea jackets, mesh stockings, and 
bell-bottoms for the girls. One 
of the group, a junior in Eng
lish, said that Techs beat 
image was one of the reasons 
why she chose Pitt.
Sitting nearby, a bearded and 
booted sophomore with plans to 
transfer complained of the hipper than thou attitude that he 
had encountered in Skibo. You 
try to look Tech, he said, but the 
in-people make it clear that you 
dont really belong.
But regardless of appearance, 
in many circles Carnegie Tech 
students do have a nice reputatibn.
A lot of art students come in 
when Im in Dinosaur Hall, said 
one Carnegie Museum guard. 
Theyre very nice; they clean 
up and leave everything neat. 
No Berkeley-ites 
Theyre well-behaved, dont 
get arrested like the kids at Ber
keley do, a deli-grill employee 
said, admitting a bit of prejudice.
The same people who noted 
peculiarities in -appearance were 
among the first to admit that 
Tech students are bright and 
creative. Even if theyre the 
way they are, some of them do 
have genius.
Two beauticians discussed Tech 
visitors to Shadyside: They 
come out in groups. ... A lot of 
them are very quiet. . . . Theyre 
absorbed in their work, some
thing they like to do.
Naming several prominent 
Tech alumni, a Shadyside cof
fee shop owner with a son in 
medical school asked matter-of(Continued on Page 13)

Film And Forum Offer Meanings Of New Theology
Carnegie Techs Death of 
God program got under way 
last Thursday night with a 
teach-in in the ballroom in 
Skibo. Despite a conflict be
tween a basketball game and 
fraternity rush, over 250 stu
dents turned out to hear and 
participate in an open-ended 
discussion.
The program opened with a 
film dealing with Thomas J. J. 
Altizer and then three spokes
man presented a discussion on 
what significance and meaning 
the philosophy of the death of 
God has on them. Speaking were 
Father Andre Schuwer, Professor 
of philosophy at Duquesne Uni
versity, The Rev. Ralph Hagopian 
of the United Oakland Ministry, 
and Evan Melhado, senior, chem
istry. Following these talks the 
program got into discussion 
among some 250 individuals pres
ent, some individuals vehemently 
denying that God is dead or even 
unemployed.
Yesterday, Dr. Thomas Altizer 
spoke on The Christian Meaning 
of the Death of God. A full re
port of his talk and the dialogue 
with Rabbi Richard Rubenstein 
will appear in next weeks Tar
tan.
The series will continue next 
Tuesday, Feb. 14, with Prof. Eu
gene Fontinell. Prof. Fontinell 
will speak at 4:30 in the Skibo 
ballroom, his topic being A Ro
man Catholic Version of Radical 
Theology. A dinner will follow 
at 6:00 and students may sign up 
for it in the Y office, room 57, 
Skibo.
Books Available
Several books are available in 
the Tech Bookstore for those in
terested in doing some reading on 
the subject. Of particular inter
est and most highly recommended 
is Radical Theology and the Death 
of God by Thomas Altizer and 
William Hamilton, published by 
Bobbs-Merrill and priced at $1.85 
in paperback. Other books are 
God is Dead by K. Hamilton, pub
lished by Eerdmans in paperback; 
The Future of Belief by Dewart; 
The Death-of-God Controversy by

don, $1.45 in paperback; Honest to 
God by JAT Robinson, published 
Westminister, $1.65 in paperback; 
and Letters and Papers from 
Prison by D. Bonhoeffer, publish
ed by Macmillan, $1.45 in paper
back. Also, another book by Alti
zer: The Gospel of Christian
Atheism, published by Westmin
ster, at $1.75 in paperback, is 
a principal work on the subject. 
Of particular interest to Tech stu
dents is a book by Rabbi Richard 
Rubenstein, chaplain to Jewish 
Students, entitled After Ausch
witz, published by Bobb-Merill.
The books by Hamilton, De

The film From Here to Eternity is one of those few rare cases 
when Hollywood, with uncharacteristic simplicity and taste, made 
c great movie out of a great book.
The film improved on James Jones novel; the sprawling novel 
of pre-World War II army life gained focus and power in this 1953 
film.
The locale is the U.S. army barracks, Honolulu; the time: 
those few peaceful, unsuspecting: days before the onslaught of 
Pearl Harbor and the War.
The hero Robert E. Lee Pruwitt, a recent transfer from another 
regiment, finds himself in conflict with his new commanding officer 
who demands that Pruwitt join the company boxing team. Pruwitt 
refuses; although a skillful fighter, since blinding a man in the 
ring, he has given up boxing. A wilful individualist, we watch how 
his honesty gets hits him into various complications, and eventually 
leads to his death. Along the way, a love interest develops (Don
na Reed); his best friend dies in a hair-raising night scene; and Burt 
Lancaster has a secret love affair with the Captains wife (Deborah 
Kerr). The film comes to a climax dramatically with the sudden 
Sunday morning attack of Pearl Harbor.
The movie ends on a note of resolute finality with the image 
of Kerr and Reed on board ship, leaving Hawaii, looking out on the 
receeding island.

Part-Time Employer
Employees who make under $1,000 for the calendar 
year while working in Pittsburgh are entitled to reclaim 
their $10 occupation tax deduction at the end of that year.
According to City officials, it is the responsibility of 
employers to inform their employees of this fact. And it 
seems that many employersCarnegie Tech, for onehave 
done a poor job.
Along with January pay checks, the college sent a no
tice regarding, among other things, the occupation tax re
fund. However, the notice did not explain that students 
would have to call the City for refund applications, nor did 
it tell student employees that they would have to pick up 
W-2 Wage and Tax Statement forms from the Assistant 
Treasurers office. Until last week, when a student informed 
school officials of tax refund procedures, the college had 
been sending students downtown to pick up their applica
tions. It had not realized that a phone call would suffice.
Other employers have not even bothered to send out 
their statements, which, by the way, do mention the refund, 
and, because many part-time employees know nothing about 
these statements, the City will get to keep much of the 
money that it should refund.
The occupation tax refund instructions should be in
cluded on the OT-2 form (this is the form that is sent to all 
employees by the City Treasurer as a receipt of the tax 
payment). Since most students working part-time will make 
under $1,000 during this year, they are interested in and 
entitled to a refund of the $10 tax, for this may represent 
a large percentage of their part-time income. Although the 
city is largely at fault, it is imperative that Carnegie Tech, 
as an employer, inform its employees of the procedures that 
are necessary for obtaining this refund.
Carnegie Tech must assume responsibility as an em
ployer to inform all employees, including students who work 
or have worked part-time, of all matters concerning taxes 
and wages. The Tartan urges the Assistant Treasurers 
Office to utilize more efficient methods of communication 
than word-of-mouth. Several methods can be used, such as 
announcements on bulletin boards around campus and in the 
cashiers office, letters of explanation (which could be in
cluded in pay envelopes,) sent to all employees, and perhaps 
an article in the Tartan at the appropriate time of year. ....
Landlord Or Father?
The conflict between Mens Dorm Council arid the Ad
ministrations Disciplinary Committee resurrects two longneglected questions of administrative policy at Tech. What 
is the exact relationship between the school and the student 
self-governing bodies like MDC, Student Senate, and 
AWS?
Consider the first question. School-operated housing is 
either simply a convenience for students, having little ef
fect on their academic experience, or it is an integral part 
of the educational process.
If school housing is just a convenience and doesnt 
really influence what a student learns, then the relationship 
between school and student in the housing area should be 
that of landlord and tenant, with the school assuming all the 
prerogatives and responsibilities of a landlord.
This means that the school would deal directly with all 
problems of damage or disturbance in the dorms, just as a 
landlord does. Tenants with complaints about living condi
tions could appeal directly to the school, making organiza
tions like MDC unnecessary. (The Welch Hall case, and 
many other down problems, could be handled faster and 
more efficiently if they didnt have to go through MDC.)
The landlord-tenant relation also implies, though, that 
the school could not force any students, even freshmen, to 
live in its housing. Further, it implies that as a commercial 
landlord, the school might have to consider changing many 
of its outdated rules in the dorms, such as no opposite-sex 
visiting in either mens or womens dorms, and ten oclock 
weeknight curfews for freshman women, so as not to be 
considered archaic as landlords go.
Now, however, assume the other answerthat school 
housing, and extracurricular living conditions in general, 
are meant to be part of the total educational experience. 
This assumption leads into the second question originally 
posed.
Anyone who thinks dorm life is an integral part of the 
educational process at Tech is out of touch with reality. 
Dorm life, and student life outside the classroom in general, 
is educational only if the student is indeed to exercise per
sonal responsibility and to involve himself in a democratic 
self-governing social system.
Tech students do not assume social responsibility, nor 
do they take seriously student governing bodies like MDC,

sor Lois S. Josephs will close the 
fcur-part series of Tuesday lec

All members of the Carnegie 
Tech Community are invited to 
the lectures.
cause the men had not had a 
trial before MDC.
MDC tried the case, and 
found one man innocent, or
dered two men out of the dor
mitory system, and ordered the 
fourth man to move out of 
Welch and into another dorm, 
with he stipulation that he 
would be removed completely 
from the dormitory system if 
he caused further trouble.
The men appealed to the Dis
ciplinary Committee, which re
viewed MDCs decisions and then 
changed the sentences of the three 
men found guilty. All three were 
moved out of Welch and into 
another dorm, with the under
standing that further violations of 
dorm rules could result in more 
serious action, such as removal 
from school.
Higher Court Needed
Upon hearing of the Commit
tees decision, Ron Haan, presi
dent of Welch, who initiated pro
ceedings against the men, claimed 
that the Committees overruling 
of the MD decision makes it 
useless for us to sit in Dorm 
Council for hours listening to peo
ple and making decisions.
See Editorial, 
Landlord or Father?, this page
George Brown, Dean of Student 
Affairs and a member of the Dis
ciplinary Committee, answered 
that in every system there must 
be some higher court to which 
a denfendant can appeal, just 
as in the United States courts, 
one can appeal all the way up 
to Supreme Court. Brown said 
that in hearing the case, the 
Committee kept in mind Dorm 
Councils decision and its reason
ing behind that decision, and 
tried to act, as always, in accord
ance with the Carnegie view of 
education.
Rush 
Opener

cause gradually, I got the feel
ing I was missing a lot. Stu
dents at Tech, he says, are like- i 
ly to be strongly interested in 
some kind of intellectual pur
suit, and social development 
tends to take a back seat ... .1 
learned a lot in the fraternity, 
not only about how to get along 
with other people in the group, 
but about how to run a business.
Fraternities offer great op- *! 
portunities to develop mean
ingful relationships, says 
Young. They also offer a per
son great opportunities to frit
ter away a lot of timeIF he is 
predisposed to do so.
They do make some demands 
on individual freedom, he said, 
but most Carnegie Tech frater
nities do not stifle individuality. 1 
Young closed by admonishing, 
Dont be afraid to admit that 
seme fraternity activities are 
fun .... its not all character 
development and educational 
processes.
Personal Decision
Both Swank and Young warned 
the freshmen to discard all their  
preconceptions about fraternities 
and find out for themselves. 
Said Swank, I hope you wont 
make your decision on the basis 
of what some confirmed non
conformist on this campus has 
told you, because chances are he 
dosent know too much about this 
system either .... the frater
nities here are not like fraterni
ties at Penn State or anywhere 
else.
The two men fielded questions 
from the floor after their talks.
As to what to look for dur
ing rush, Swank said talk to the 
people .... the important thing 
is not whether the floors are 
cleanly waxed. Young claimed 
that what fraternities look for 
in rushees is new members . .
. . . with new points of view and 
new attitudes.
The Administration does not 
set academic standards for fra
ternities, according to Swank, 
because the fraternity is a so
cial organization .... academic 
goals are pretty much a mat
ter for the individual chapter 
to decide.
One student asked about frater
nities and fine arts students. 
Swank answered that it is not 
now the College of Fine Arts 
policy to discourage fraternity 
membership, and the fraternities 
themselves realize the great demarids on time the Fine Arts Col
lege makes, and are willing to 
make very great concessions to 
permit fine art students to join.
Addressing Fine Arts students 
directly, Swank said You have 
responsibilities as members of 
that college to meet with, talk 
with, and find out about students 
with activities and interests dif
ferent from yours.
The final question of the even
ing was, Just how degrading is 
pledging? Answered Young, 
Very few of them perish.

Trees Leveled 
Due To Disease
Editor, the Tartan:
The sycamore or oriented plane 
trees on Frew Street that were 
cut down during the Christmas 
vacation period were on city 
property,. They were cut down 
by the City Forestry Department. 
These trees were infected with 
canker stain disease. It is anti
cipated that other similar trees on 
the Campus will, in time, be cut 
down for the same reason. Plans 
are being made to replace these 
trees according to a master plant
ing plan which is being developed 
by the Campus Landscaping Arch
itect.

Correction On 
Caltech Dates
Editor, the Tartan:
Your editorial (Jan. 11 issues) 
makes slightly erroneous refer
ence to Caltechs academic calen
dar. Caltech is on the quarter sys
tem and, except for a two-day 
weekend, there is no reading per
iod between the end of classes and 
finals week.
The first quarter begins late in 
Sept. continues for 12 weeks, and 
ends with a two-week break for 
Christmas. Second quarter begins 
the first Monday after New Year, 
and runs 11 weeks. There is a 
one-week break - alas! rarely at 
Easter - followed by third quarter. 
This lasts ten weeks for seniors 
and graduate students and 11 
weeks for all others. (No classes 
are held during the summer quar
ter.)
The first day of each quarter 
(normally a Monday) is devoted 
to registration, and the last week 
to final exams. Since most stu
dents exams are over in two or 
three daystwo each day till 
theyre done  breaks between 
quarters are usually lengthened 
beyond the nominal time.
Pressure under this system can 
be brutal, but since balance lies 
in having breaks between rather 
than during quarters. Also, many 
students and instructors prefer the 
more intensive quarter to the longer semester.

Pool Closed 
During Exams
Editor, Tartan:
On Saturday morning, Jan. 14, 
we all had finals. That afternoon, 
we wanted to relax and go for a 
swim at the Tech pool. When we 
got there, about 3:00, we were 
told by the custodian that the 
Pool was not available and he 
would be leaving soon anyhow. 
The only part of the gym that 
was open was the main gym 
and Thistle Hall for exams. While 
we realize that exams are important, we also believe that what
ever facilities possible should be
made available to students who 
would like to take a' break from 
the grind of studying.
If Tech in its newr merger with 
Mellon will be worth 160 million 
dollars, it seems that there should 
be a few dollars available on 
Saturday to hire a life guard and 
keep a custodian around. A group 
with its own life guard should be 
able to swim with only a custo
dian around.

Reserve Flag 
For VIPs
Editor, the Tartan:
Every week as I head from 
Morewood to class I see a strange 
sight: the flag at half mast.
At first I thought that the flagpuller-upper had become tired 
half way through and just stop
ped.
After more investigation, how
ever, I found that the half mast 
flag signified the death of some
one. Once it was a janitor, once 
a teacher, once Mr. Hunt. But 
most of the time I did not know 
for whom the flag was lowered. 
Again today the flag flies at half 
mast. Perhaps the husband of a 
secretarys brothers wifes aunt 
died, or perhaps one of the maids, 
or a student, or perhaps the pul
ler-upper developed severe back 
strain.
The point Im trying to make 
is that the flag is lowered so often 
it loses significance.
The flag is a symbol of our na
tion, and as such should only be 
lowered when a figure of national 
prominence dies, such as Presi
dent Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson, 
or a great man such as Albert 
Schweitzer.
Or perhaps we should leave the 
flag permanently at half mast to 
honor the men fighting and dying 
in Vietnam, or children who die 
of disease or hunger each day, 
or old people who die of old age, 
or ones who die in automobile ac
cidents. In other words, in order 
to honor all those who die each 
day.
But this is not done on a na
tionwide basis, and it probably 
would be too hard to show that 
this is what was meant.
So instead, why not let the 
flag be raised and lowered as in 
other parts of the country to hon
or national figures?
If the administration feels it 
must somehow honor staff mem
bers who die, why not use some 
kind of school flag?
But the United States Flag at 
half mast should be reserved for 
national mourning.
Linda G. Eyster 
Sophomore, Chemistry
War Wont Solve 
Viet Problems
Editor, the Tartan:
I am writing in response to the 
YAF statement in the Jan. 10th 
Tartan. I think that it should be 
quite unfortunate if your paper 
did not print some of the opinions 
of people who are basically op
posed to the type of statement put 
out by the YAF, and opposed to 
the whole United States policy in 
Southeast Asia. There is another 
train of thought on this problem, 
one which is completely opposed 
to the YAF policy. I think it im
perative that the Tech commun
ity be presented this argument 
and be allowed to form its own 
opinion on the basis of differing 
views of the matter. I do not pre
tend to be a spokesman for any 
particular group or ideology, but 
rather I am presenting my own 
opinions, and my interpretation 
of the opinions of people with 
whom I have come in contact and 
whom I respect and admire.
I deplore the use of violence 
in any form, and I reject the 
theory that any person or nation 
could or should interfere in the 
basic right of another individual 
or nation to formulate its future 
as it sees fit. It is upon this basis 
that my remarks are framed.
The situation that has develop
ed in Southeast Asia since the 
end of World War II is basically 
political in nature and as such 
has never been, is not now, and 
never will be, amenable to a 
military solution. It is the strug
gle of a brave and free people 
to rid themselves of foreign in
tervention and colonialism. It is 
their struggle to express their 
national identity to the world, 
and to work out on their own 
what their destiny will be. One 
has only to read the reports that 
Harrison E. Salisbury has written 
from Hanoi to get an idea of how 
brave and determined these peo
ple are. The people of the DRV 
(Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 
the name Ho Chi Minhs followers 
have given to their country.) 
have had one of the mightiest 
military machines in the world 
thrust upon them and there is no 
indication that they are not will
ing to fight it by every means 
possible until it is no longer a 
threat to their peace and sover
eignty.
Consider what has happened in 
the much heralded Iron Triangle 
near Saigon. American and ARVN 
(Army of the Republic of Viet
nam) troops have converged on 
the area and literally destroyed it 
and made it unfit for human hab
itation. For weeks there was in
discriminate bombing of the area, 
then bulldozers were moved in 
and the jungle was leveled. Not 
only was the jungle leveled, but 
whole hamlets, villages, and towns 
were utterly destroyed and with 
them rice paddies and rubber 
trees. More then 600 bodies were 
counted and called Communist, 
more than 5000 people were forced 
to move off the land their families 
had owned for centuries, into refu
gee camps. And why? Whatever
the reason, I cannot see that any 
possible gain is worth this suffer
ing, this degradation of human 
spirit and dignity. For more than
20 years these people had lived 
peacefully with the Viet Cong; 
they were able to feed them
selves, raise their crops and their 
children, and earn a living. But 
a man cannot survive when a 
bomb falls on him, he cannot 
feed hungry mouths from rice 
fields that have been bulldozed 
into oblivion. Surely Hitlers in
vasion of Poland couldnt have 
been more senseless, surely his 
treatment of the Jews could not 
have been more inhumane than 
what the ARVN and the Amer
icans do to Viet Cong and sus
pected Viet Cong prisoners.
Why? Why? That is the ques
tion I am asking you.
I dont think there is a vast 
conspiracy at work in Asia, I 
dont think that the vital interest 
of the United States is threatened 
by what happens in Vietnam, or 
that the United States should in
tervene militarily in the political 
situation in Asia. I think that 
China is perfectly willing to let 
all countries exist peacefully on 
its borders. Mr. Salisbury conclud
ed as a result of talking with high 
officials in Hanoi that the DRV 
is fiercely independent of China 
and Russia, and that the NLF is 
quite independent of the DRV. 
He thus concludes that the war in 
the South began as a spontaneous 
uprising totally unrelated to any 
foreign aggression upon South 
Vietnam. I think that the only 
way that the vital interest of the 
United States is threatened in 
Vietnam is by our pouring billions 
of dollars into the war there, to 
the neglect of our urban centers 
and other problems caused by 
poverty and incomplete integra
tion of people of all colors into 
American life.
What is my solution? I have 
none. I think that the only way 
the problem of Vietnam can ever 
be faced is for the thinking of 
each American citizen to return 
to the ideals of the founders of 
this country and to come in line 
with what our government says 
our mission in the world is. The 
American people must come to 
believe iif the idea of freedom for 
all people, the right of each na
tion to manage itself without fore
ign interference, and of each per
son to have a voice in the govern
ment that rules him. Then proba
bly the most important for a tech
nological age, they must become 
completely willing to let anyone 
who so wishes, practice socialism.
I think that there are some spe
cific immediate actions that this 
attitude implies. Here I am only 
repeating those things that such 
people as U Thant, Pope Paul, 
Edwin Reischauer, a former am
bassador to Japan and perhaps 
the foremost American student of 
Asia, Senator Fullbright, Ho Chi 
Minh, and others have said. First 
ox all we must stop the bombing 
in the North, unequivocally and 
unilaterally, without prior assur
ances that anything would result 
from this action. We must stop 
the influx of men into the South
and stop the escalation of the 
fighting. We must indicate a com
plete willingness to negotiate with 
the NLF as a legitimate repre
sentative of at least a portion of 
the South and show that the NLF 
would be an integral part of any 
collation government resulting 
from the negotiations. Finally we 
must give assurances that the 
American military will immedi
ately begin to move out of Viet
nam.
Why do I take such a stand? 
Just as the YAF says its patriot
ism demands a wider war in Asia, 
my patriotism demands that I 
oppose the war. I oppose it in 
the light of what it is doing to 
the people of all of Asia. I oppose 
it in the light of what it is doing 
to the people of the United States, 
where every citizen is becoming 
increasingly infected with the 
spirit of war and has grown prac
tically immune to moral judg
ments concerning the killing of 
anyone to whom our government 
attaches the label Communists, 
and where greater burdens are 
brought to bear upon the poor 
who must carry the weight of 
increased taxes in addition to pro
viding most of the fighting men. 
I also oppose it in the light of 
what it is doing to the world opin
ion of the United States.
My plea is that people every
where be free to live as they 
choose, that people everywhere 
be free from napalm and TNT, 
that rice fields everywhere be al
lowed to grow and feed people. 
My plea is that each American, 
and especially those of the Tech 
academic community, consider 
very carefully what their govern
ment is doing in Southeast Asia, 
and take action according to his 
best analysis of all the facts of 
the situation. My plea echoes that 
of Pope Paul, In the name of 
God, stop.

THE GAME IS OVER is Roger Vadims creation and I felt that 
he wasnt quite sure just exactly where he was going with it. The 
result is that, aside from some well-selected cheesecake shots of his 
wife (Jane Fonda) and some rather nice photography, the film falls 
short of being much. The plot (based upon an Emile Zola novel) 
is sort of a pot purr i of Phaedra and Room at the Top, combined with 
occasional Fellini-like sequences.
The story is about a wealthy French industrialist who has mar
ried an equally wealthy young woman (Jane Fonda). She is in her 
late twenties or early thirties and falls hopelessly in love with her 
husbands 22-year-old son, played by Peter McEnery. The existing 
marriage is in name only and Renee (Miss Fonda) wants a divorce 
to marry Maxine (Mr. McEnery). The father, realizing only too well 
that they have been bed partners, tells his son that he must be
come engaged to a well-to-do-bankers daughter. The idea is that 
this union will form a strong monetary alliance, saving the family 
business and insuring Renees financial welfare, both of which will 
otherwise fail. Renee knows nothing of this, and Maxime, believing 
that his fathers motives are purely altruistic, goes ahead with the 
plan. In the meanwhile, Renee has heard of this plot and returns 
home to find that the man she is getting divorced for is betrothed 
to another. Afraid of her making a scene at an elaborate engagement 
party arranged for the young people, the father leads her quietly 
upstairs to sit on a chair in the small gymnasium where she had so
desperately tried to conserve her youth. The film ends at this point.
The three actors are adequate enough. The dialog was general
ly vapid. There was even a we cant go on like this. All of this 
made the picture in addition to being a family affair, a dull one too. 
The film may currently be seen at the King Court Theatre in Oak
land.

Blow-Up...

faces driving through the Lon
don morning. Their antics are 
inter-cut with our introduc
tion to the photographer who 
remains nameless through the 
film.
This scene takes place in a 
ccurt-yard of foreboding institu
tional edifice. Out of the heavy 
prison-like doors come an assort
ment of worn and tattered men. 
The scene is evocative of grimy 
age, but in the group is a tattered 
young man with fashionable long 
unkempt hair and an angelic face, 
clutching a brown paper bag: 
the Mod rebelthe Chelsea boy 
who has become a symbol of a 
type of exuberance associated not 
only with the Beatles and the 
Stones but with something slight
ly wild and free and empty and 
perverse.
Frames of reference begin to 
change: the tattered boy walks 
to a Rolls convertible parked 
away from the court-yard and 
drives off; out of the paper bag 
comes an expensive camera. What 
weve seen is masquerade. His 
masquerade is sharpened by the 
group in white face who are 
making a general loud nuisance 
of themselves. The photographer 
tips them as he drives home to 
his studio.
The film then records a 24-hour 
span in the life of the young man. 
From his digs, he is obviously 
successful. From the models he 
photographs, he is obviously high 
style. From his being pestered 
by two 15-16 year old birds, he 
obviously represents something 
in. Now. A Mary Quint or Vidal 
Sassoon or, wellyes, Vanessa 
Redgrave. What happens this day 
might just as well have happen
ed yesterday or tomorrow, but 
because the moment is important 
the future and past have no more 
meaning than the antiques in a 
junk shop.
The happening that disting
uishes this day begins with the 
anxiety the photographer causes 
to a young woman he photo
graphs in a park as she walks 
with an older man who is per
haps her husband, her lover, 
her mark. The girl is agitated 
to the point of violence and 
she appears later at his studio 
offering herself in return for 
the roll of film. The photo
grapher is not as interested in 
her physical presence as he is 
in the image of her that he 
wishes to put on film. He pla
cates her with an empty roll 
of film and when it seems we 
might learn something about 
her, she leaves. In an attempt 
to solve her mystery, the photo
grapher develops the film.
This sequence is the heart of 
the 'film. It is also a cinematic 
tour de force. Out of a series of 
blow-ups of two people in the 
park a mystery greater than the 
girl herself develops. Why did 
the girl pull the man into a 
specific place before she would 
allow him to kiss her? Why is 
she looking over her shoulder 
when the man does embrace her? 
What does the look on her face 
mean? Antonioni, however, has 
not as much cheated the germ of 
a mysterya Rear Window thril
ler, but has created a metaphor 
of appearance and reality. How 
much like the film director cre
ating a sequence of a film-mani
pulating time-space to illicit a 
reactionis the photographer ar
ranging the blow-ups so the scene 
he photographed in the park 
takes on meaning entirely differ
ent than context.

not trying to photograph peo
ple, he is attempting to re-cre

photograph that relates a froz
en sensitivity; the photograph 
that preys on life waiting for 
that moment when a person is 
most exposed.
The camera is more than a ma
chine to him. It is an organ, 
something sexual, a part of him
self that assures his place in the 
world. Without his camera, he is 
not alive or complete. What ap
pears to the audience as truth is 
often only another masquerade 
__ another fantasy. Even the 
photographs which we accept as 
reality are placed in a configura
tion that might only be a fan
tasy. By the time the final blow
up is obtained, the image is dif
fuse and undefined. Like a non
objective painting, it becomes 
what you want it to be.
Antonioni himself is a photogiapherthat superman of the 
camera obscura known as the 
movie director. By the time the 
film is overit runs a little under 
two hours  the photographer 
has exposed his emptiness, his 
perversity, his sadism, his sex
ual fantasies, his body without 
a soul to the celluloid, on which 
the images are recorded. An An
tonioni film at its best is a series 
of images accentuated by words. 
In an Antonioni film a characters 
eloquence is not necessarily the 
way to his soul. An Antonioni 
character is so complete a crea
tion that you can guess what 
kind of cologne he wears. (At 
least I think I know what per
fume Monica Vitti wore in LVen
tura although I cant remember 
the name of the character por
trayed.) David Hemmings plays 
a character without a nameor, 
if he has one, I didnt catch it. 
Vanessa Redgrave plays a wom
an without a past beyond the 
park sequence, but within this 
woman is enough torment and 
anxiety to last the run of any 
Bergman film. She is on screen 
for about 15 minutes. Sara Miles

Draft Procedures, Guidelines ...

should be in the top one-half, of 
the full-time male students en
rolled in that class. Sub-seniors, 
planning to enroll as fifth-year 
seniors should be in the upper 
three-forths of the male enroll
ment in their class.
3) Selective Service College 
Qualification Test Scores: For all 
freshmen, sophomores, juniors, 
and sub-seniors, planning to en
roll in the next class in the fall 
must attain a score of 70 or above. 
Seniors intending to pursue grad
uate study must attain a score of 
80 or above.
Deferment Not Guaranteed 
It is important to note that the
draft test may be taken only once 
by a student. Further, while the 
above are guidelines for defer
ment, the successful fulfillment 
of these requirements does not 
automatically guarantee defer
ment.
Seniors planning graduate 
study, in addition to the afore
mentioned criteria, should noti
fy their draft board that 
they plan to attend graduate 
school, and should request a 
letter from the graduate school 
to be sent to the local board 
stating that the student has 
been accepted for graduate 
study. This will delay the re
classification procedure until
the student enrolls in the gradu
ate school in the fall, at which 
time the graduate school will 
send a certificate of enrollment 
to the students local board.
For those seniors intending to 
obtain a critical skills deferment, 
several points must be kept in 
mind. First, such a deferment is 
obtained only if 1) the employer 
is listed as critical to the health, 
welfare, or defense of the United 
States, and 2) the position to be 
filled by the employee must be 
critical. Secondly, the critical 
skills deferment is obtained 
through the employer after the 
employee is on the payroll.

because they know the school 
stands ready to overrule them, 
chastise them, or rescue them 
it they happen to make a mis
take. They know they are not 
really assuming responsibility 
or governing themselves, they 
are just playing games.
It is easily apparent that MDC, 
AWS, and Student Senate do not 
finally have power to make rules, 
administer discipline, or control 
the spending of money. The Ad
ministration must either give 
these bodies meaningful author
ity, or abolish them and deal di

Nature of the University
Crowded Courses Divide, 
Shift To Accommodate All
Last week many Tech students taking humanities cours
es found themselves in the middle of a problem equally 
cumbersome for teachers and students: overcrowded class
es. As a result of the lack of any means for predicting class 
sizes, several courses were overrun as Margaret Morrison 
humanities majors, students in the E & S double major pro
grams and minor-sequence programs converged on the 
available humanities options.
The problem varied in serious
ness:
well over 100 students 
crammed into the sections of 
C-804, Modern Writers;
Shakespeare, C-807, was 
chosen by almost 60 students;
? more than 50 students 
showed up for the C-level course 
in Modern European Fiction;
>- over 40 students were on 
hand at the unpopular 6:30 pm 
hour for the English Departments 
only night course in the Modern
Novel;
? 36 students began the first 
class of C-827, Development of 
the Modern Mind, and 33 appear
ed in C-836, Development of the 
Arts in the Modern World. These 
are B-and C-level history courses 
respectively.
Minor Sequence Crowded
According to Associate Profes
sor David H. Fowler, acting Head 
or the History Department, the 
high history enrollments are for 
the most part confined to courses 
comprising the E&S history minor 
sequence. These courses are 
> taken by E&S history minors, 
other E&S students seeking their 
distribution course, and MMCC humanities majors.
The E&S humanities minor 
sequence, now In its second 
year, requires a student to take 
four courses, of which three 
may be concentrated in a parti
cular fieldeither psychology, 
economics, history, or English.
In these areas, sequences have 
been set up with A-level (intro 
ductory courses, followed by 
B-and C- courses of increasing 
depth. The fourth course must 
be from a different discipline 
than the other three, and thus 
is known as the distribution 
course.
Dr. Fowler points out that the 
E&S minor sequence is invaded 
by MMCC history majors because 
the number of pure MMCC 
courses is limited by the relative
ly small history enrollment. When 
a course is of interest to still 
another group (as the C-836 Arts 
course is to Fine Arts students) 
its enrollment is further boosted. 
Philosophy courses have greatly 
increased enrollments for this 
reason: last semesters three sec
tions in one course have expand
ed to five sections of two courses.
Humanities courses have be
come increasingly accessible to 
E&S students through double
major programs, in which stu
dents can earn two undergrad
uate degrees, for example, in 
5 lis tor y and Physics.
While it is possible to manage 
courses with large enrollments, 
this would be especially undesira
ble from the student point of view. 
Professor Fred A. Sochatoff, As
sociate Head of the Department 
01 English, emphasizes the con
cept-orientation of English cour
ses as the primary reason for 
small sections in which students 
Ve more opportunity for dis
cussion.
25 Upper Limit
As a result, Dr. Sochatoff en
gineered staff resources and 
course schedules so that English 
courses now have a maximum 
section size of 25, even though 
this required creation of extra 
sections and a good deal of shuf
fling of students.
In general humanties enroll
ments have been rising, and they 
will of course shoot up with the 
formal opening of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
(Continued on Page 13)
Highlander
(Continued from Page 1)
Plans Useful Later
Dean Brown added that, in re
viewing the proposal at budget 
meetings it was deemed more 
practical to incorporate the sug
gested Highlander Room facilities 
in plans for addtion to Skibo.
A Tartan editorial last semester 
claimed that the Highlander pro
ject could be integrated into ex
pansion plans for Skibo, since any 
addition would be built on the 
parking lot side, but Brown re
vealed that there has been talk 
of expanding Skibo in opposite 
direction toward the tennis courts.
No timetable has been set up 
for building an addition to Ski
bo.
Sharon Rambo, chairman of the 
Student Union committee said she 
was not surprised that the High
lander plan was rejected after 
she heard the estimate. The 
Union committee will now start 
work on suggestions for the Skibo 
addition. They are going to re
view floor plans and sketches of 
the MIT student union.

The trouble is, I'm just too Bizet to pick one out. And 
whats more, many of the new cars I see are Offen
bach in the garage for repairs. But I do have a good 
friend who is pleased with his new 67 Dodge Dart. 
He was given an excellent deal and Berlioz any 
money on it. My Bach istothewall.Canyou help me?
LUDWIG
DEAR LUDWIG:
My advice is that you let yourself Ravel in the enjoy
ment of driving the sporty, all-new Dart for '67. 
You'll find its Lrszt price is a lot lower than youd 
expect. And even though its longer outside and 
bigger inside this year, Dart's still an easy car to 
Handel.
C^tu6eAi^./ hb'
Heres the swinging, man-sized compact for '67 that's got three Bs of 
its own: Bold, Brassy and Beautiful. Dart has been completely restyled 
this year, inside and out. Its longer, roomier, more powerful. But still at 
that snug compact price. Drop in at your nearest Dodge Dealers and 
try it out for yourself.

Last year, thousands of lawyers, bankers, accountants, engineers, doctors and businessmen went back to college.
And not just for the football games.
Wed like to clear up what appears to be a 
misunderstanding. It is somewhat popular 
on campus to decry a business career on 
the grounds that you stop learning once 
you start working for Cliche Nuts & Bolts.
That idea is groundless.
We cant speak for Clich, but we can 
for ourselvesWestern Electric, the man
ufacturing and supply unit of the Bell Sys
tem. 6 out of 10 college graduates who have 
joined us over the past 10 years, for exam
ple, have continued their higher education.
Howre these for openers:
W.E.s Tuition Refund Plan lets em
ployees pursue degrees while work
ing for us. Over 6 thousand have at
tended schools in 41 states under 
this plan. We refund more than $1 
million in tuition costs to employees 
a year.
To name another program: advanced 
engineering study, under the direc
tion of Lehigh University, is con
ducted at our Engineering Research
Center in Princeton, N. J. Selected 
employees are sent there from all 
over the country for a years concen
trated study leading to a masters 
degree.
You get the idea. Were for more learn
ing in our business. After all, Western 
Electric doesnt make buggy whips. We 
make advanced communications equip
ment And the Bell telephone network will 
need even more sophisticated devices by 
the time your fifth reunion rolls around. 
The state of the art, never static, is where 
the action is.
At Western Electric, whats happening 
is the excitement and satisfaction of con
tinued doing and learning. If this happens 
to appeal to you, no matter what degree 
youre aiming for, check us out. And grab 
a piece of the action.Western Electric

riously, again the problem was 
of a man alienated from those 
around him who chose to follow 
his conscience. When Sir Thom
as, more eloquently says, regard
ing his martyrdom, Finally it is 
not a matter of reason; finally it 
is a matter of love, one her.rs 
echoes of Robert E. Lee Pruwitts 
simply justification: If a man 
dont go his own way, hes noth
ing.
As the barrister, Lord Chan
cellor, Scholar and with Sir 
Thomas More, Paul Scofield, is 
superb. He uses his expressive 
eyes, beautiful voice to great 
effect; even his silence have 
the clarity of crystal.
The dilemma faced by More 
is whether to legitimatize the 
marriage of Henry VII to Anne 
Boleyn, or else withhold sanction 
because of church dogma and the 
dictates of his conscience. Zinnemans style is simple, unpretenti
ous, the camera evokes beautiful
ly the verdant splendor of 16th 
Century England, and its leisure
ly way of life. Fine performances 
are Leo McKern as playful, chil
dish Henry VIII, and John Hurt 
as Sir Thomas betrayer, and one
Qlass
strange bit, with Orson Welles 
who as Cardinal Woolsey, looks 
like a huge bloated goldfish with 
a hangover. Fred Zinneman is a 
fine, highly skilled artist, whose 
movies have a rewarding sim
plicity of style, and consistency 
ox theme. The director of High 
Noon, From Here to Eternity, and 
now A Man for All Seasons, Zin
neman has secured an important 
and durable place in the Amer
ican film. Both movies, needless 
'to report, are well worth seeing.

The theory underlying the ed

Slack stated that he would not

(Continued, from Page 1)
jng that he was not the first 
Negro to be expelled from the 
Georgia legislaturein 1898, 27 
Negroes were elected and 26 ex
pelled. He told the audience that 
They didnt expell the 27th be
cause he was extremely fair
skinned and they werent sure.
Students Spark Rights
Later at Carnegie Lecture Hall, 
Bond spoke on the development 
of the Civil Rights movement 
over the past few years. Things 
really began to happen in 1960, 
he stated., when, for the first 
time, students began to play an 
active role in the movement. He 
discussed the effectiveness of sitins, freedom rides, and other 
student activities.
In 1963, says Bond, the Civ
il Rights Movement was re
evaluated, although Negroes 
could then use some of the 
same toilets as whites, and eat 
in some of the same restaur
ants, they still had no effec
tive political power, because 
they were not literate enough 
to pass tests for voter quali
fication.
He charged that the tests at 
that time were designed specif
ically to keep Negroes away, and 
that most Negroes had decided 
that it was not worth risking 
their jobs and their lives to 
^ vote. In response, the Movement 
began a new approach, Freedom 
Schools were built and Negroes 
were registered to vote by the 
thousands. To illustrate the sit
uation that Negores faced, Bond 
noted that in 1965 in Lowndes 
County in Alabama, where the 
population is 18 percent Negro, 
no Negroes were registered, and 
125 percent of the whites were 
registered to vote.
Third Party Needed
Bond also asserted that in the 
South, the needs of Negroes are 
not satisfied by either the Dem
ocratic or Republican party, 
both of which generally support 
segregation. This has led to the 
rise of third political parties, 
such as the Black Panther Party 
in Lowndes County.
Julian Bond concluded his 
speech by stating that the social 
system as organized is not capof Negroes, and that since the 
white power structure lacks the 
will, courage, and intellect to 
grant Negroes their rights vol
untarily, it must be forced to do 
so.

course sizes have been held down 
for the students benefit, not

to move out of comfortable 11:30

Literature into 8:30 sections in

Blow-Up...
(Continued from Page 9) 
Antonionis art that enables him 
to capture that moment when a 
ges' or reaction cuts through 
to the soul. His films are more 
than projected images; they are 
alive.
Another presence in the film 
is London. Shot in the rich 
earthy colors suffused with 
northern light, the film is Gains
borough  Constable. The 
color photography is by Carlo 
di Palma and is, to say the 
least, brilliant. From the rich 
humid decadence of a London 
party that seems to have been 
going on for days, the pastel 
bacchanal involving the photo
grapher and two birds in a nest 
of Lavender construction pa
per to park full of trees in cons
tant erie motion, every bit of 
the film is stunning.
There are superstitions regard
ing the camera, warning that a 
photograph captures the soul of 
the person photographed. After 
seeing Blow-up, I believe in this 
particular superstition. The film 
is to be found at the Shadyside 
Theater in Shadyside. Ive found 
that its actually a four hour film 
since I have not been able yet to 
leave after seeing it for the first 
time.

factly: Dont you think that 
Carnegie Tech Is well-known

However, the fact is that even 
some Pittsburghers know very 
little about the school. It pro
vides a fine technical education,

he pored over the new books

know is that its an engineering

This is not the same Carnegie 
Tech I knew. . . . There was more

STAMP OUT YOUNG LOVE
It happens every day. A young man goes off to college, 
leaving his home town sweetheart with vows of eternal 
love, and then he finds that he has outgrown her. What, in 
such cases, is the honorable thing to do?
Well sir, you can do what Crunch Sigafoos did.
When Crunch left his home in Cut and Shoot, Pa., to go 
off to a prominent midwestern university (Florida State) 
he said to his sweetheart, a wholesome country lass named 
Mildred Bovine, My dear, though I am far away in col
lege, I will love you always. I take a mighty oath I will 
never look at another girl. If I do, may my eyeballs parch 
and wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may my 
ever-press slacks go baggy!
Then he clutched Mildred to his bosom, flicked some 
hayseed from her hair, planted a final kiss upon her fra
grant young skull, and went away, meaning with all his 
heart to be faithful.
But on the very first day of college he met a coed named 
Irmgard Champerty who was studded with cultu -e like a 
ham with cloves. She knew verbatim the complete works 
of Franz Kafka, she sang solos in stereo, she wore a black 
leather jacket with an original Goya on the back.
Well sir, Crunch took one look and his jaw dropped and 
his nostrils pulsed like a bellows and his kneecaps turned 
to sorghum. Never had he beheld such sophistication, such 
intellect, such savoir faire. Not, mind you, that Crunch 
was a dolt. He was, to be sure, a country boy, but he had a 
head on his shoulders, believe you me! Take, for instance, 
his choice of razor blades. Crunch always shaved with 
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and if that doesnt 
show good sense, I am Rex the Wonder Horse. No other 
blade shaves you so comfortably so often. No other blade 
brings you such facial felicity, such epidermal elan. 
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades take the travail out 
of shaving, scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull, 
oust the uch. Furthermore, Personnas are available both 
in double-edge style and in injector style. If youre smart 
and Im sure you are, or howd you get out of high school 
youll get a pack of Personnas before another sun has set.
But I digress. Crunch, as we have seen, was instantly 
smitten with Irmgard Champerty. All day he followed her 
around campus and listened to her talk about Franz Kafka 
and like that, and then be went back to his dormitory and 
found this letter from his home town sweetheart Mildred:
Dear Crunch:
Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down to 
the pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of 
anybody. Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots 
of Yiutsy stuff like that. Well, I must close now because I 
got to whitewash the fence.
Your friend,
Mildred
P.S----1 know how to ride backivards on my skateboard.
Well sir, Crunch thought about Mildred and then he 
thought about Irmgard and then a great sadness fell upon 
him. Suddenly he knew he had outgrown young, innocent 
Mildred; his heart now belonged to smart, sophisticated 
Irmgard.
Being above all things honorable, he returned forth
with to Cut and Shoot, Pa., and looked Mildred straight in 
the eye and said manlily, I do not love you any more. I 
love another. You can hit me in the stomach all your might 
if you want to!
Thats okay, hey! said Mildred amiably. I dont love 
you neither. I found a new boy!
What is his name? asked Crunch.
Franz Kafka said Mildred.
I hope you will be very happy! said Crunch and shook 
Mildreds hand and they have remained good friends to 
this day. In fact. Crunch and Irmgard often double-date 
with Franz and Mildred and have barrels of fun. Franz 
knows how to ride backwards on his skateboard one-legged.

Opening Lead: Club 5.
East decided to sacrifice at five 
diamonds after hearing his part
ner announce a very long suit 
and little else with his jump 
overcall and rebid. When South 
persisted to five hearts, East 
should have realized that freak 
distribution was present and 
should have passed immediately. 
His bid of six diamonds alerted 
South to the possibility that the 
opponents held little defensive 
strength, and the heart slam was 
bid. East, though somewhat shak
en, still had the gall to double.
West, knowing that he couldnt 
cash a diamond, tried to defeat 
the hand by finding his partners 
strength in dummys first bid 
suit. Instead, South clubbed the 
defense by winning the opening 
lead, knocking out the heart ace, 
and using trumps for entries to 
discard spades on the good clubs. 
West cannot be blamed for not

Many of you probably have no
ticed the column, entitled Inter
collegiate Bowling in this 
weeks Tartan. This team, made 
up of the top bowlers of the 
intramural teams, cannot right
fully be called a varsity because 
it is not financed by Techs var
sity budget. Instead the $25 entry 
fee into the league (the Western 
Pennsylvania Traveling League of 
the National Intercollegiate Bowl
ing Association) and long-distance 
phone calls are paid for by the in
tramural department, while tra
veling expenses and bowling fees 
are paid by the individual mem
bers of the team.
As can be seen from the Inter
collegiate Bowling article, this 
years team consists of a fine 
bunch of bowlers. They are proba
bly as good or better than any 
college bowling team in the TriState area and, as such, should 
receive support from the Varsity 
Athletics Department. The team 
members give their money, time, 
and effort in an attempt to rep
resent Carnegie Tech in the best 
way they can.
A varsity bowling team is one 
of the least expensive of all var
sity teams. A total sum of $300 
could finance the entire team for 
a complete season. It has been 
awhile since a request has been 
made of the Varsity Athletics De
partment to include bowling as 
a varsity sport. I believe the time 
has come for such a request to be 
repeated so that Tech can have 
another varsity sport of which 
it may really be proud.

by LARRY SIKON 
Tartan Sports Editor
After a long absence, pro basketball has returned to Pittsburgh. 
The announcement of the formation of the American Basketball As
sociation and of its having a franchise in this city pleased many of 
the areas sports fans. The desire for a pro team in this city has 
been quite evident from the attendance at the Philadelphia 76ers 
games played here at the Civic Arena.
Last night, area fans got to see two of the leading players of 
the NBA in Wilt Chamberlain and Rick Barry. Chamberlain has been 
the spark plug of the league-leading 76ers, while Barry, in averag
ing well over 30 points per game, has led his Warriors to the top 
of the Western division.
High-scoring Rick Barry of the San Francisco Warriors has been 
named Rookie-of-the-Year in all sports for 1966 in Sports Maga
zines 20th annual selections honoring the top performer in every 
sport.
The award, one of 13 top performer selections announced in 
the current issue of Sports, goes to Barry who has been called the 
most sensational first-year man to hit the National Basketball Asso
ciation since Elgin Baylor.
Barry, who played his collegiate basketball at the University 
of Miami, finished fourth in the NBA in scoring with a 25.7 points 
per-game average and was named to the All-Pro team, thus insur
ing his selection as Sports Rookie-of-the-Year for all sports. Previous 
winners were Chicago Bears halfback Gale Sayers and Minnesota 
Twins outfielder Tony Oliva.
Also among the awards announced by Sports Magazine were 
Man-of-the-Year and Top Performer in Baseball honors to Frank 
Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles.
Say the editors of Sport in explaining their choice: Frank Rob
inson did it all. He led the league in batting, .316; he led the league 
in home runs, 49; he led the league in runs-batted-in, 122. He be
came the first player to win the Most Valuable Player Award in 
both leagues. And he continued his onslaught in the World Series, 
starting the rout of the Dodgers with a first-game, first-inning home 
run, and ending it in the fourth game with the home run that gave 
the Orioles a 1-0 victory and a sweep of the Seri.
Is it any wonder then that Sport should honor Frank Robinson 
as its Man-of-the-Year for 1966? ask the editors.
The complete listing of Sport Magazine awards for 1966:
Man-of-the-YearFrank Robinson, Baltimore Orioles.
Top Performer in Pro FootballBart Starr, Green Bay Packers.
Top Performer in College FootballSteve Spurrier, University 
of Florida.

by Jim Janke
Throughout the past month, as Ray Burdett goes, so goes the Tartan basketba 1 
team. Everyone in the district who covers basketball has heard of Rays sparkling de
fensive ability; but it was his offensive desire which has turned the CIT record from 
1-4 to 8-6. The Tartans stretched their win streak to six gamesno other CIT five has 
been able to do that in Moe Fassinger's memory  only to have it broken in a game at 
Geneva Saturday night.
This week CIT plays Bethany 
and Grove City, both games 
away. The Tartan quintet has a 
good chance to take both games; 
both Bethany and Grove City 
are in slumps. (Grove City lost 
last week to Allegheny, 68-63;
CIT has defeated Allegheny 
twice). The next home game is 
February 17 against Case in Skibc gym at 8:15 p.m.
Keefer Stars
In the away game January 10th 
against Allegheny CIT won hand
ily, 74-50, paced by the outside 
shooting of Don Keefer and Jeff 
Kalin. Tech grabbed an early 
lead and the final result was 
never in doubt. For Allegheny,

and Howald had <?ver 80 percent

Burdett Paces
At Skibo gym on January 28, 
CIT defeated St. Vincent in a 
poorly played game by both 
squads. Although Tech had the 
lead throughout the first half, 
poor shooting discipline and fouls 
cost the Tartans a chance to keep 
the lead for long. Mark Lang had 
four fouls in the first 12 minutes 
oi the game and able to play 
only 16 minutes of the entire 
game before fouling out. Kalin 
had three personals in the first 
half and had to be subbed for.
By the halfway mark of the 
second period, St. Vincent had 
built a 50-43 lead on the excel
lent shooting of John Pranaitis, 
who had 16 points in the second 
half alone. But John Meister and 
Bill Weborg came off the bench 
with two timely buckets, and Hay 
Burdett added another two goals 
a 55-53 lead with five minutes 
remaining. Then Burdett, who 
lately has been combining good 
outside shooting with his already 
well - respected defensive work, 
started a three-goal one man 
flurry that put CIT out in front 
to stay. In the last 40 seconds, 
with St. Vincent using a fullcourt press to try to get the ball, 
Barry Hummel scored two lay
ups to give Tech the 66-61 vic
tory.

Tartans Top Thiel
Last Tuesday Thiel fell to the 
consistent, but not extremely 
shrarp, attack of the Tartan quin
tet. With Thomas An til and Monc'ok leading the early scoring, 
Thiel jumped out to an early 
lead and led at the half, 32-25. 
Then CIT switched from the us
ual man-to-man defense to a 1-3-1 
zone which forced the Thiel five 
into a half a dozen turnovers in 
half. In the first eight minutes of 
the early minutes of the second 
this period CIT outscored Thiel
14 to 4, and from then on the 
Tartans controlled the game. Ray 
Burdett once again was hot on 
offense, for he led all scorers 
with 22 points. But it was Jeff 
Kalin with eight points in the 
first 10 minutes of the final per
iod who put CIT out in front. He 
v.as the second leading scorer 
for CIT with 15. Dave Thomas, 
a 6-5 freshman for Thiel, hit bet

from outside and led the Tomcat 
scoring with 18. What kept CIT 
from breaking the game wide 
open was their offensive rebound

Kalin Top Scorer
Alleghenys second battle with 
Tech last Thursday proved to be 
a repeat of the first. CIT took 
an early lead and expanded it 
rapidly to a 37-18 halftime edge. 
With the second half 10 minutes 
old, and Tech at a 65-33 lead, 
subs came into the game from 
both benches. Jeff Kalin had an
other good night with 21 points 
in only 30 minutes, while Don 
Keefer, Mark Lang, and Ray Buraett each were in double figures. 
Burdett in the last five games 
averaged 15.6, which is remark
able for a defensive man of his 
stature (he got a two-column 
spread in the Press last week). 
John Gunselman was high for 
Allegheny with 16.

Swim Team Gets First Win
After Loss To Bethany
by Larry Anderson
Four pool records went as Bethany humiliated Tech in 
a 70-25 victory. Bethany, a school which gives scholarships 
to its swimmers, is undefeated this year, and according to 
Coach John N. Trezise, it is one of the strongest teams 
Tech will face this year.
Bethany set pool records in the 
200-yard individual medley (time 
- - 2:11.9), the 100-yard freestyle 
(51.2 seconds), the 500 yard free
style (5:35.8) and the 400-yard 
relay (3:29.4). Some confusion 
may arise as to the difference be
tween Tech team records and pool 
records. Pool records may be set 
by Tech or its opponents, while 
swimming in the Tartan pool. A 
record may be set by any 
Tartan swimmer at home or aw
ay.
Records are considered official 
when a first place is taken and 
the time is clocked by two timers 
or when the swimmer earns a 
second place and three timers are 
present. Both pool and Tech team 
records are posted on the south 
wall of the swimming pool.
Tech managed only one first 
place as John Bennet excelled in 
diving, collecting an individual 
total of 162.95 points. This total 
is arrived at by adding the three 
judges scores together of each of 
the dives and multiplying by the 
degree of difficulty. The judges 
scores vary from one to ten by 
one-half point intervals and the 
degree of difficulty varies from
1.0 to 2.9, depending on the skill 
involved. A diver must do five 
dives of his own choice and one 
obligatory one. The mandatory 
dive is performed by all the 
divers and is chosen by the visit
ing team out of a hat by chance. 
An example of a dive is a front 
one-and-a half in the pike posi
tion. The degree of difficulty is
2.0 and involves one and one-half 
turns in an L shaped position, 
a good substitute for circus watch
ing.
Scoring for all individual events 
is five points for a first place, 
three points for a second and an 
assured one point for third place 
as two members from each team 
complete. In the relays seven 
points is given to the winning 
team.
Swim Team Victorious
The Tartans outswam Cleve
land State University 58-37 in their 
first performance of the season 
last Saturday, Feb. 4.
Once again, Pete Hutter broke 
the school record in 50 yard free
style with a winning time of 23,1 
seconds, besting his old mark by 
two-tenths of a second. First 
places were taken by Merril Moter (200-yard freestyle), Preston 
Biglow (200-yard individual med
ley), Pete Hutter (100-yard and 
50-yard freestyle) and the 400- 
yard relay team of Les Hough, 
John Perry, Merrill Moter, and 
Pete Hutter.
John OBrein returned to the 
team after recovering from a 
broken arm and, with only three 
days of conditioning, finished sec
ond in the tiresome 500-yard free
style to clinch the victory.
