Pennsylvania Enforces 
Dry Spell99 For All Kinors
As Classes Begin ...
All children beware! Big Brother, in the guise of the 
State Uiquor Control Board, is watching you. A new bill, 
signed by Governor Scranton last August 14, makes it illegal 
for persons under 21 years of age to possess intoxicants. This 
shifts the responsibility for illegal liquor possession from
the seller to the buyer.
The law in its entirety reads:
Section 675.1: Prohibiting the 
Purchase, Consumption, Posses
sion, or Transportation of Intoxi
cating Liquors or Malt or Brewed 
Beverages by Minors.
It shall be unlawful for a per
son less than twenty-one years 
of age .to attempt to purchase, 
consume, possess, or transport 
any alcohol or malt or brewed 
beverages within the Common
wealth (of Pa.).
Any person violating the proW visions of this section shall, upon 
conviction in a summary pro
ceeding, be sentenced to pay a 
fine OF NOT LESS THAN 
TWENTY - FIVE NOR MORE 
THAN ONE HUNDRED DOL
LARS and costs of prosection Or 
undergo imprisonment for a term 
not exceeding thirty days or 
both.
Recent raids on two of Techs 
habitual hangouts, the Greeks 
%and The Holiday, seem to indi
cate that the local law enforcers 
are going to push this new law 
to the hilt. Warnings were sent 
to all colleges within Pennsyl
vania, including Tech. As to how 
long this dry spell will last, 
no one can say.
Sororities 
Keet Frosh
From 1:30-3:30 on Sept. 29, 
freshmen women will meet the 
Greeks at a tea held in the Morewood Recreation Room, Each so
rority has its own display and 
offers the freshmen a chance to 
discuss sororities with them. The 
event will be high-lighted by the 
showing of a film entitled, From 
Alpha to Omega, which is pro
duced by the University .of Wis
consin Panhellenic Association. 
This sound color movie will give 
the freshmen a view of both sides 
of rush. It displays the freshmens 
contemplation of rush and also 
the preparation of the sororities 
prior to and during rush. It is 
hoped that this will give the 
a personal view of typical rush 
experiences and allow her to ap
preciate both the planning and 
organization needed.
The Film Arts Society of Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology is about to begin its twelfth year of presenting the 
worlds greatest motion pictures. Since 19n1 the Society has 
presented over two hundred and fifty films of the highest 
calibre, and this year twenty-eight more will be added to
a the list.

the Society will present such 
cinematic achievements as Wild 
Strawberries, by Ingemar Berg
man; Douglas Fairbanks in The

T ecli T raditions 
Go Up In Smoke
Saturday, September 20, saw 
the revival of the Freshmen- j 
Sophomore Tug-of-War and with 
it some unexpected difficulties.' 
The total turnout was approxi- j 
mately 600 students, and the ob
ject of the game was to get the 
centerpoint of the rope across a 
certain line or goal. Before the 
reward for winning could be an
nounced to the freshmen, which 
was their exemption from the 
Traditions Test, the pulling began. ; 
Within several seconds, each team \ 
developed in excess of five tons 
which parted the rope on the 
freshman side. This, of course, al
lowed the centerpoint to cross the 
sophomore goal, making the soph
omores victorious. The freshmen, 
however, in a frightful show of 
poor sportsmanship, cried default, 
and with the help of many strong 
arms and a single match, reduced 
all copies of the traditions test to 
black ashes. The Traditions Test 
will be foregone this year.
Dames Club
The Tech Dames Club extends j 
a cordial invitation to all wives 
of Tech students to attend the an
nual tea, which will be held at 
Skibo, on Sunday, Sept. 29, 1963, 
at 2 oclock. Their sponsor, Mrs. 
Burchard, will be speaking to 
them on The National and Local 
History of Dames Clubs. The 
purpose of Tech Dames Club is to 
promote social and educational 
activities among the wives of the 
students.

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN
Colleges are complicated and bewildering places, filled with 
complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine 
one of the most complicated and bewilderingyet fetching and 
lovableof all campus figures. I refer, of course, to the dean 
of students.
Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and 
oracle, proconsul and palthe dean of students is all of these. 
How, then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the best 
way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean. 
Here, for example, is what happened last Thursday to Dean 
Killjoy N. Damper of the Duluth College of Belies I-ettrea 
and Pemmican.
At 6 a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on 
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder 
which had been placed there during the night by highspirited undergraduates.
 folictm, klmSktbJ, kr-.
At 7 a.m. he lit a Marlboro and walked briskly to the cam
pus. (The Dean had not been driving his car since it had been 
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited 
undergraduates.)
At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro and 
climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been 
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with 
E. Pluribus Ewbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young 
Ewbank had been writing a series of editorials urging the 
United States to annex Canada. When the editorials had 
evoked no response, he had taken matters into his own hands. 
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he 
had gone over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great 
patience and several Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded 
young Ewbank to give Manitoba back. Young Ewbank, how
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.
At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Robert 
Penn Sigafoos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who 
came to report that the Deke house had been put on top of 
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under
graduates.
At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire 
an intramural softball game on the roof of the law school 
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during 
the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the 
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam
pus swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been 
placed during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. 
Marlboros were passed after luncheon, but not lighted, owing 
to dampness.
At 2 p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit a Marlboro and 
received the Canadian Minister of War who said unless young 
Ewbank gave back Winnipeg, the Canadian anny would march 
against the U.S. immediately. Young Ewbank was summoned 
and agreed to give back Winnipeg if he could have Moose Jaw. 
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but finally con
sented after young Ewbank placed him on the roof of the 
metallurgy building.
At 3 p.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delega
tion from the student council who came to present him with 
a set of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years service as 
dei.n of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with 
all his clothing and fled to Utica, New York, where he is now 
in the aluminum siding game.
The makers of Marlboro, who sponsor this column, don't 
claim that Marlboro is the dean of filter cigarettesbut it'* 
sure at the head of the class. Settle back with a Marlboro 
and see what a lot you get to Uket

Plurality versus Quality
At the Student Congress meeting today, 
amendment to their constitution will be of
fered for discussion. It is to have the Chair
man of Student Congress elected by an all
campus ballot. Those voting for this amend
ment, because they believe it has popular ap
peal should give more than just a superficial 
glance to this motion.
First, an all-campus election would be 
difficult to manage. nly one ballot could 
be taken and a chairman would be elected 
by a mere plurality, which would certainly 
be a small fraction of the student body.
Second there is a assurance that a quali
fied person would win the chairmanship. For 
instance, an appeal by a popular dorm coun
selor or RTC sergeant to the freshman class 
could win a plurality.
Third, at too many schools where an all
campus election is conducted, it is the large 
fraternities or other organizations that con
trol the electionGand why shouldnt they?
With the all too prevalent problem of only 
10% or so voting, one hundred votes count 
as a thousand; and when only a plurality is 
needed, it could assure the election. Wouldnt 
you vote for a sororitys queen candidate if 
they promised to give forty to fifty votes to 
your fraternity brother for chairman?
Finally, the main objection to this reform 
is that it will make the chairmanship election 
a popularity contest. Why should organiza
tions back a AKC candidate when, with the 
same amount of trouble, and certainly a 
tremendous savings of money, they could 
back a future chairman? If it is argued that 
this trouble exists today, this motion can do 
nothing but compound the difficulties. Per
haps these large organizations wield con
siderable influence now, but this is far differ
ent from the outright buying of votes.
We hope that the members of Student 
Congress seriously consider all the problems 
of this amendment before voting.
M.L.S.
Freshmen, Dear Freshmen
by Justin Polulack
The sun also rises on Carnegie 
Institute of Technology and with 
it every morning also rise some 
800 freshmen who are getting 
their hearts into the work anew, 
as well as agape, aghast, agog and 
also  aha !
Along with them are surviving 
past freshmen (how past in some 
cases I decline to say). Also 
awakening are the AH, Skibo, and 
library staffs, faculty, rent-a-cops, 
maids, janitors, green men, squir
rels, and of course J. C.
Last week after a studious, pro
ductive summer (popular subject: 
nothing; frequent occupation: like
wise), the society dubbed as Techmen (and the other two types) 
coagulated on the verdant Tech 
malls which will all too soon be 
spattered with leaves as dead as 
the preceeding, precious summer. 
The students have come to pay 
tuition, room and board, to make 
good concupiscence is a necessi
ty in Schenley Park, to register, 
to buy sneakers, insurance, tooth
paste, to sign schedule cards and 
to put nickels into parking meters 
(you only wish you could Frosh).
With the sun high in the sky, 
they are treated to delicious lec
tures, scrumptuous recitations, 
delectable labs, and delightful 
seminars  also baked Haddock 
(Stouffers answer to scrod) ev
ery other Friday. Happy but dim 
are the memories of freshman 
camp, parties, mixers, meeting 
and receptions. The serious busi
ness of doing better than the 
other fellow has taken hold and 
will keep squeezing till the bitter 
or sweet end in June  if we can 
take it that long.
The sun sulks toward Pitt and 
the tramping feet of the golden 
grid men crunch the cinders in 
Tech bowl. Quickly the roar of 
football practice fills the evening 
air punctuated with barked signals 
and enthusiastic grunts.
Its not long before somewhere 
beyond the Golden Triangle the 
gun disappears and, except for the 
park, the activity is where the 
lights are. In the library, wheels, 
in minds harmonize with the air 
conditioning and discord with the 
riffling of pages and subdued 
voices. The click of billiard balls 
and ping-pong balls are heard in 
Donnor while Morewood lounge 
is filled with warm inviting light 
and the gay sounds of congenial
ity. Rush parties are in high gear 
and the long line of impatient 
faces in the bookstore has become 
shorter  the faces less impatient.
Thus Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology begins its 9 months of
pregnancy, more familiarly thought 
of as the academic year 1963-1964. 
If there are no complications, to it 
will be born in June a new brood 
of sophmores, juniors, seniors and 
graduates. And then Tech will
stand quitely robed in the span
gled wilderness of the West all 
summer until next fall when more 
savage strife and stresses plague 
a new flock of freshmen agape, 
aghast, agog and also aha !

about is the patter of little feet. 
For people who dislike the plinkplink of little feet there is hope, 
for soon the sound will be plunk - 
plunk as their little arches collapse 
under the load. For as was editor
ialized 50 years ago, College life 
for all of you is something new.

is in colleges and what you pic

A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
Advice To Freshmen
I sang de Swanee River
In days of long ago.
I sang about de Chariot
An wished it would swing 
low.
I danced de good old Essence 
An fancy steps beside,
But dis ragtime musics sumpin
I sholy never tried.
1s picked upon de banjo
While young folks shoo der 
feet.
Sashay an swing yoh corners ! 
Cut dat pigeon wing so near!
De noo song was invented
By de white foks in deir glee
An de white folks gotter sing em 
Couse dey aint no count to 
me.
aow that you freshmen have become partially acquaint
ed with the folkways of Tech, it is time that you learned 
some of the facts of the lie. As a public service this article will 
be devoted to aiding your education.
Kost of you have gone to summer camp and then, if you 
are male, come into contact with some phase of fraternity 
rush. As a result, you have probably received the impression 
that there is a great deal of school spirit of the rah! rah! 
variety here. This is untrue. The average student is apathe- * 
tic; in fact one outstanding characteristic of Techs atmos
phere is the widespread absense of any normal school 
spirit (like Pitt has or instance). You are being indoctrinated 
by persons or organizations that have a stake in hoping for 
a change. An example: Ap to now you have been taught to 
believe that Student Congress is important G it isnt.
If you enjoy going to a football game and cheering or 
want to join many organizations, you should. But dont feel 
guilty if you dont. You will be following a well trod path G 
one which this writer thinks is more conducive to learning. 
aote: aot social knowledge G book knowledge. If you look 
about you, you can pick up social knowledge with a minimum 
of effort.
Perhaps from the above you think that I am anti-frater
nity. This is not so. (Perhaps I should say some of my best 
friends are fraternity members?) Fraternities offer many 
advantages and are not closed societies G as at some schools, p 
They offer members a social life G friendships that is G and 
a large number of you will be happier if you join one. The 
houses offer a wide variety of images (including apathy). You 
can choose the fraternity that most fits you.
In some departments (majors), certain achievements give 
the achiever high status. The goals to work toward in a 
few departments are given below.
Home Iconomics: two dates a weekend.
Physics: a four factor.
Drama: acceptance by other dramats.
If you eat in Skibo, dont return your tray and dishes. 
Uook about you; you will see a woman staring at your dishes.
It is her job to return them if you dont. If everyone returns 
his dishes, she will lose her job; then Stouffers will make 
more money. Does that sound fair?
It is hoped that the words of wisdom imparted here will 
prove useful to the reader. J

rientation Ixercises 
Inspire Freshmen
Freshman rientation Week 19E3 initiated a new attitude 
on the Tech Campus. Included in the week was the usual 
welcoming address by Pres. Warner, the orientation tests by 
the Bureau of Keasurement and Guidance, and the rest of 
the introductions and addresses that are mechanically part
of Orientation Week. But the Or-4--------------------------------------------
ientation Week Committee, under 
the leadership of Joe Sandulli, 
decided last spring to rise above 
mere mechanics and introduce the
freshmen to the extra-curricular 
life at Tech in a forceful and 
positive manner.
The program was initiated 
with signs in the freshmen dorms 
demanding dink wearing and a 
knowledge of Tech history and 
traditions, and the closing of cer
tain walkways to freshman use. 
The dink again became a ticket 
to enter orientation activities.
The orientation weeK theme of 
a liberal education through books 
AND activities was carried 
throughout the orientation pro
gram with the Activities Fair. At 
the fair, Tech organizations op
erated booths in the Skibo ball
room where they explained their 
activities to the freshmen. Thanks 
to John Blue, the affair was well 
organized, and thanks to an in
spired freshman class, there was 
a large trunout. Both of these 
ingredients formed one of the
most successful Activities Fairs 
in several years.
The Orientation Week Commit
tee had another first in the ac
tivities assembly. Here the fresh
men heard Tom Pyke, Student 
Congrehs Chairman; Dave VandeLinde, CFP President; Judy 
Phillis, Pan-Hell President; and 
Rich Ferguson, Varsity athletics, 
speak on their respective aspects 
of extra-curricular life.
Adding some athletic exercise 
to the week was the annual Sports 
Day headed by Tom Johnson. Or
ganization and an inspired fresh
man class sgain created a suc
cessful event.
The behind the scenes workers 
on the committee included. Sue 
Rose, Sec.; Eric Erenrich, Treas.; 
Roger Powell, Publicity; John 
Talpas, Tom Glassburg, Leroy 
Gunner, Joe Bowman, and Mar
tha Hodgson. The workhorses and 
unsung heroes of the week were 
as usual the Cwens, sophomore 
womens honrary, and the Scimi
tars, sophomore mens honorary.
Scaife Grant Launches 
 MMCC Counseling Program
With the help of a $30,000 gift through the generosity of 
Krs. Alan K. Scaife, Kargaret Korrison Carnegie College 
has launched a three-year program called aew entures in 
Higher Iducation for Women. The program will be devoted 
to research on how best to counsel women undergraduates 
for their future roles, and on the4 
implications for society in the
newly - emerging patterns men
tioned above.
Mrs. Scaifes gift will also give 
impetus to Dean Steinbergs plan 
to begin an honors program and 
to establish in the near future a 
research institute on the prob
lems of American women in the 
twentieth century. Among the 
specific problems that Dean Stein
berg sees as being considered by 
such an institute are the place 
of women in industry, now and 
in the future, and the impact of 
the working mother on herself, 
on her family, and on society.
Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College has already taken several 
concrete steps, both in counsel
ing its undergraduates and re
training its graduates. The Col
lege has established a freshman 
orientation program, aimed 
specifically at prompting the stu
dent to start thinking about her 
life after graduation. And as the 
result of an alumnae survey, the 
College last year instituted a com
plete program of re-education for 
its graduates. Thus far 12 alum
nae have enrolled for the train
ing necessary for new careers.

tion to support two traveling 
scholarships, one to be awarded 
last spring and the other in 1964. 
Each of the scholarships is valued 
at $2500. Qualifications for the 
scholarship include general aca
demic performance with ^pecial 
emphasis on creative promise. The 
Foundation expressed a wish that

Rush Activities
by Tom Glassberg
Hush, as even the grade students must know by now, has 
started. For a week and a half the class of 19E7, with a few 
odd transfer students thrown in for good measure, have been 
the honored guests of Techs twelve national fraternities.
They have been wined (with soda pop) and dined, pumped
with handshakes, pinned with#----------------------------------------------------
name tags, and filled with infor
mation by the Greeks, some of 
whom will be brothers, room
mates, and life-long friends.
The frosh have been scurrying 
to and fro from Alpha Alpha Al
pha one night to Zeta Zeta Zeta 
the next. By means of tours, 
formal dinners, informal BS 
sessions, Friday-night smokers, 
and Saturday-night blasts, the 
rushees have seen a fairly clear 
cross-section of Greek life at 
Tech. Buggies, beer blasts,
booths, I.M. football, mixers,
Morewood, water battles, Greek,
Sing, Greek Week, formais, plankjousting, UMOC, Carnival, cul
ture, calculus, home coming 
these are very impressive things 
to tell freshmen about drinking 
rush. But the Greeks have em
phasized spirit, rather than the 
activities themselves. They have 
cited fraternities as developing 
maturity, leadership, responsibil
ity, character, and pride of owner
ship. This year they have laid 
increasing stress on scholarship 
and education, whether that edu
cation takes place in the physics 
lab or on Zeta Zeta Zetas Greek 
Sing team.
Rush is supposed to be the 
time period in which freshman 
and fraternity men really get to 
know each other. Because of the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
liberal rush rules this year, rush 
fulfills this purpose better than 
ever before. Freshmen this year 
are allowed to drop over to the 
houses at any time during the 
day. Likewise, the Greeks are 
permitted to contact rushees in 
the dorms during the same hours. 
The new rules have resulted in 
more accurate evaluations on both 
sides and, it is hoped, will enable 
all the freshmen to make up their 
minds as to whether or not. to 
join a fraternity before next 
Monday.
It should be emphasized that 
fraternity rush at CIT does not 
end with pledging night next 
Monday. Rather it continues more 
or less steadily throughout the 
year. Therefore, anyone inter
ested in starting to rush need not 
worry about being too late. Re
maining events in the formal rush 
period include dinners Thursday 
and Friday, a date lunch and 
football game Saturday, a party 
Saturday night, and pledging 
night on Monday.

Alcoa & J & U 
Grant Aid
The heads of two of the largest 
corporations in the United States 
will guide the final five years 
of Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogys ten-year $32,225,000 devel
opment program which started in 
1957.
Charles M. Beeghly, chairman 
erf the board and chief executive 
officer of Jones & Laughlin Steel 
Corporation, and Lawrence 
Litchfield, Jr., board chairman 
and chief executive officer of 
Aluminum Company of America, 
have accepted the co-chairman
ship of the development pro
gram that will direct Techs ef
fort to raise over $8,000,000 by 
April, 1967. About $24,000,000 of 
the ten-year goal has been raised 
during the first five years.
Commenting on the acceptance 
of this responsibility by Mr. 
Beeghley and Mr. Litchfield, Car
negie Tech president J. C. War
ner said, I deeply appreciate 
the willingness of Mr. Beeghly 
and Mr. Litchfield to devote their 
valuable time to insure Carnegie 
Tech's future. Men of their stature 
are of immeasurable value to edu
cation, especially to private col
leges and universties.
A $1,000,000 gift from the Rich
ard King Mellon Charitable Trust 
was the first donation received. 
The announcement of the gift was 
made by Mr. James M. Bovard, 
chairman of the board of trustees 
at Carnegie Tech. Mr. Bovard, 
stated that the gift had been made 
possible through the generosity 
of General and Mrs. R. K. Mel
lon and predicted complete suc
cess for the development pro
gram in the near future. The latest 
gift raises the total amount con
tributed by General Mellon to 
Carnegie Techs development pro
gram to $2,450,000. The only re
striction placed on the gift is that 
it is to be used in Carnegie Techs 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence.

tice has carried right over into 
the fall season. According to Head 
Coach Joe Gasparella, The en
thusiasm has been very good. The 
boys have held it all through 
practice. They have it now, and 
I am confident that they will have 
it during the game. The entire 
staff has been very pleased with 
the attitude and enthusiasm that 
has been shown.
This year a total of forty men 
are on the roster as opposed to 
twenty-eight last year. While this 
is an improvement, Coach Gas
parella pointed out that the teams 
biggest weakness is still a lack 
of depth. More than a few games 
were lost last year in the last 
quarter of play to teams with 
more manpower when Techs top 
fifteen or sixteen ballplayefs be
gan to slow down after forty min
utes of hard football. This could 
be the situation again this year 
since about twenty players will 
carry the bulk of the load.
Pro-Style Offense
The Tartans will run out of a 
pro-style formation with a split 
end and a half bock flanked to the 
other side. This offense calls for 
a good deal of passing and Coach 
Gasparella believes he has the 
two quarterbacks for the job in 
Terry Heckler and Whiz Wis
niewski.
In' the backfield with Heckler 
will be speedy A1 Abels, Techs 
Most Valuable Player last season, 
and Gilchrest, a freshman from 
Oak Park, Illinois, who has been a 
pleasant surprise to the coaching 
stage this fall.
The flanking halfback on both Love will kick off and share the 
teams will be Jim Black, backed place kicking duties with Wisup by Dave Gallo.
Ixperienced Uine
The line is not exceptionally big 
but it does have fair speed. Dave 
DAppolonia, a two-year letterman 
and Techs top receiver, will start 
at the split end and Rich Ferguson 
will open in the tight end position. 
Behind DOppolonia is Jim Clark, 
a 6-3 190 pound freshman from 
Clairton. Jules Borkowski, a top 
Tech basketball player was sched
uled during practice, an injury 
that will keep him out the rest 
of the season. Gasparella com
mented that Jules had looked very 
promising despite his lack of ex
perience.
Two experienced tackles, Duane 
Palmo and Pete Mangarella, are 
backed up by George Webb and 
freshman Pete Bair. Jackson Love 
and Kent Baldauf also have plenty 
of experience at guard and have 
Linsey Sargent and Frank Groll 
behind them. Groll is rated as 
Techs top defensive linesman. 
John Mordecai will start at center 
with Dave Heil as his substitute.
These same boys will be count
ed on to play defense and this 
could hurt, especially at away 
games where the home team will 
be able to substitute freely under 
their own substitution rules. At 
home, Tech will abide by NCAA 
rules that do not allow this free 
substitution.
The punting chores will be 
handled by Heckler and Gilchrist.
niewski.
Alternating: Captains
No captains have been elected. 
With a seven-game schedule and 
six seniors on the team, these 
seniors will alternate as acting 
team captain.
Coach Gasparella pointed out 
that Carnegie has a well-balanced 
attack that will feature a good 
variety of passing and running. 
No opponent will be able to gear 
his defense to stop either an all 
ground or an all aerial game.
The pro-style offense is new to 
Tech this year but the coaching 
staff is pleased with the way the 
players have picked it up. Early 
mistakes are to be expected, 
especially since the first team has 
not had a real test. In the scrim
mages, the first team looked 
sharp against the second unit, but 
the lack of depth make it im
possible for the starting team to 
face the quality of opposition they 
must contend with during the sea
son. This has been a big hurdle to 
overcome during fall practice and 
Coach Gasparella feels he really 
wont be able to evaluate his team 
j until the season gets underway.
In any event, Carnegie Tech 
should have an improved foot
ball team this season. With a new 
coach, a more wide-open exciting 
offense, and a lot of spirit, there 
should be a few more games in 
the Tartans win column.
The Intramural Officials Club 
needs many new members this 
year if it 1 to carry out its func
tion in the intramural program. 
This club has the responsibility 
of providing officials for touch 
football, soccer, volleyball, bas
ketball, and softball.
Although the club has not been 
emphasized as much as possible 
since its founding two years ago, 
several factors are responsible for 
its increased importance this 
year. Each football game will 
now be covered by three officials 
instead of the two formerly used. 
Thus, many more trained officials 
are needed. In addition, the club 
has been given a seat on the In
tramural Board, thereby assum
ing increased responsibility in 
handling protests, proposing rule 
changes, and recommending other 
needed legislation. Finally, the 
Intramural Department real
izes that the success of the en
tire program depends upon the 
quality of officiating, and is doing 
everything possible to obtain 
qualified officials.
A student is usually attracted 
to the Officials Club for one of 
three reasons. Those interested in 
additional income find that it is 
possible to earn up to $75 a year, 
while having fun at the same 
time. Students who cannot play 
for various reasons, but still want 
to participate in some way dis
cover that the club provides them 
with excellent opportunities. 
Finally, there are those interested 
in the organizational aspect of the
program, and join to serve in this 
capacity. All three types of stu
dents are badly needed at present.
All officiating is handled 
through a schedule set up in ac
cordance with tne officials wishes, 
although an official may work as 
ofen as desired. After attending 
three training sessions, a student 
is ready to officiate events, and 
is then placed on a regular 
schedule.
All students interested in any 
phase of the clubs program 
should immediately contact either 
Bob Mercer (Pres.) at MU 2- 
9412, or Mr. Boyer, Director of 
Intramural Athletics at ext. 412, 
413.

basketball and softball. Bowling, 
the fifth major sport was won by 
Beta Theta Pi.
The Grads, who garner points 
in almost every sport in which 
they participate, also won cham

squash, and co-rec badminton. 
ATO won both the foul shooting 
championship and the three-man 
volleyball title.

Tech Bows to Ohio Wesleyan3 5-20 
Bishops Bare New Tartan Punch
by Jay Arnold
In their wide open, high scoring gridiron opener, the 
Tech Tartans bowed last Saturday to the score of 3n-20. hio 
Wesleyan claimed the victory. The 19E3 opener, punctuated 
with open offense and a significant lack of defense for both 
teams, was a complete reversal of last years Tech-Wesleyan 
game. That score was 7-0. ?
Obviously, Wesleyans brand 
new single-wing offense and the 
new Carnegie coaching staff under 
head coach Joe Gasparella, pro
vided more offensive punch for 
both squads.
Coach Gasparellas Tartans be
gan the scoring in this mistakriddled game with a pass from 
junior quarterback Paul Wisniew
ski to end Dave DApollonia. This 
13 yard blow had climaxed a 73- 
yard Tartan drive that started 
with the opening kickoff. WisyP SrAod eABO

niewski converted for a 7-0 score.
Pass Interctption
Tech was marching again after 
holding on defense, but their 
drive was halted on the Bishops 
26 after a pass interception. This 
interception sparked a Bishop 
drive that was highlighted by a 60 
yard touchdown jaunt by Wesley
an halfback Ed Curreri. At the 
end of the first quarter the score 
was tied 7-7.
In the early second quarter, 
Tech was forced to punt for the 
first time in the game and Wes
leyan took over on their own two 
yard line. Four plays later, Tech 
blocked the Bishop punt and took 
over first and ten, again on the 
Bishop two yard line. On the next 
play, A1 Abels smashed over for 
his first score of the day. A fumble 
on the conversion attempt made 
the score Tech 13, Wesleyan 7.
This was to be Techs last score 
until very late in the fourth quar
ter.
14-13 At The Half
A few minutes later with 6:19 to 
go in the half, Wesleyan scored for 
the second time on a pass to sen
ior end Dick Eww, The con
version was good and it was 14-13 
Wesleyan. Later a Bishop inter
ception deep in Tech territory 
threatened to give Wesleyan a 
third touchdown, but Tech revers
ed the tables when Wisniewski 
intercepted on his own 15 yard 
line. The first half ended seconds 
later with Tech on their own 20 
and the score read 14-13 Ohio 
Wesleyan.
The third quarter on this warm 
Saturday afternoon proved to be 
| Techs downfall as the Battling 
Bishops scored two quick touch
downs to make it 28-13 Wesleyan 
Their first score came on a fourth 
and thirteen situation in Tech 
territory when the Wesleyan 
quarterback, apparently trapped
deep in his own backfield, finally 
found a receiver in the end zone 
and lofted a pass for the TD. Wes
leyans fourth and back-breaking 
score came after Tech fumbled on 
their own two yard line.
Tech was now down by two 
touchdowns and their offense 
ground -to a halt in the third quar
ter. Wesleyan inflicted a fifth and 
final blow early in the fourth 
quarter. A Bishop lineman picked 
up a blocked Tech punt, deep in 
Tech territory and scampered 
across the goal line for the score. 
With the clock showing 14.13 left 
in the game, Wesleyan led 35-13.
Abels  Wisniewski
With an aparently reinspired 
offense, Tech drove from their
own 31 down to the Bishop 1 yard 
line only to be halted by a stiff 
Wesleyan defense. Tech defense 
held on the 15, but again Tech 
failed to push it over for a score, 
Finally with 14 seconds left in 
the game, the gold Tartans scored 
to make the final score 35-20. A1 
Abels picked up his second TD 
and Wisniewski again converted.
Coach Gasparella after the 
game said that We gained good 
experience with the single-wing 
that should help prepare us for a 
tough game next week with Den
nison. The Tartan head coach felt 
that his team relaxed in a few 
tight situations and gave Wesleyan 
the advantage. This week the 
Tartans will work on defending 
the single-wing that Dennison will 
use against them.
