President H. Guyford Stevers 
statement concerning the con
struction crisis failed to satisfy 
the faculty or students.
Tuesday, Sept. 16, both the Fac
ulty Senate and the Student Sen
ate passed resolutions urging 
President Stever to take further 
actions in support of the Black 
Construction Coalition.
Although both resolutions call
ed for a University statement to 
further expedite the course of 
the present negotiations, they 
differed in tone.
Both resolutions mentioned (a) 
Concerted action with other uni
versity presidents to hald univer
sity construction in Pittsburgh un
til the present negotiations ter
minate in an equitable settlement, 
and (2) Insistence on opportunity 
for minority participation in all 
contracts for university construc
tion.
Academic Proposal Redefined
Non-Faculty Ombudsmen Urged
PATRICIA McDONALD
The ombudsman is a govern
ment official appointed to receive 
and report complaints of the pop
ulace against the government. A 
suggestion to establish such an of
fice in the academic structure of 
Carnegie-Mellon University has 
been made and deserves some re
flection.
Indeed, the idea of an ombuds
man in an academic community 
is not a new one. The ombudsman 
has been used with success in 
other academic institutions. Arguements for establishing this of
fice at C-MU stems from the fact 
that departmental feedback is too 
slow and inefficient. Given the na
ture of the job it is reasonable to 
assume that a faculty ombuds
man would be hampered by entan
glements within his respective de
partment. These obligations would 
prohibit any faculty member ap
pointed to the ombudsman job 
from functioning effectively. An 
ombudsman who would serve the 
students most effectively would 
be a high-ranking member of a 
non-faculty group.
Urging for a non-faculty om
budsman bares and recognizes 
the fact that there is a tendency 
for faculty to protect faculty. 
Complaints commonly received 
by an ombudsman pierce the ten
der areas of the facultys con
science: poor grading practices, 
verbal (or otherwise) mistreat
ment of a student in class, fre
quent faculty absence from class, 
incoherent or unintelligible lec
tures, departmental decisions that 
are adverse to the student, cheat
ing on exams, etc.
Dangers that result to the stu
dent when he reports to a faculty 
ombudsman include the fact that
a student may get the ombuds
man for a course. This may be 
particularly painful if the faculty 
ombudsman was obliged to follow 
through on a matter with which 
he did not agree.
Secondly, faculty protects fac
ulty. Given this maxim, it is not 
difficult to predict the degrees of 
success a student would meet in 
registering a complaint with a 
faculty member placed in the om
budsman position. Many students 
would be afraid to complain.
When a student is propositioned 
by a faculty member, or when ex
ams and papers are returned with 
embarrassing and leading re
marks on them, the complaint of
ten goes unreported because of 
the lack of a free agent to whom 
the student may report. A student 
finds it difficult, embarrassing, 
and particularly ineffective to 
discuss these more delicate mat
ters with faculty personnel pro
fessionally involved with the per
son against whom the student 
wishes to complain. An outsider 
would be less involved and less 
threatening.
With these allegations, some 
faculty will rise in anger, assert
ing that their professional and perpersonal integrities are here call
ed into question. The fact remains 
that these are complaints students 
may have. An effective outlet 
should be provided for registering 
these complaints and dealing 
promptly with the matter.
An ombudsman should in no 
way be connected with the faculty 
structure. Preferably, the om
budsman should be someone from 
the Dean of Students Office who 
can vouch for the honesty of the 
complaint and maintain the ano
nymity of the student. The proce
dure is quite simple. A student 
with a complaint would go to see 
the ombudsman. The students 
statement should be taken verba
tim, by a secretary or on a tape 
recorder. Next, the statement 
should be typed, checked, and cor
rected. (Here the ombudsman 
could help the student present the 
problem clearly. >
The statement should then be 
typed in final form and copies 
sent to: 1) The Dean of the Col
lege, 2) The Head of the Depart
ment; 3) The faculty member in 
question, 4) The student, and 5) A 
file copy.
The department head reports 
back on action taken. In some 
cases, the complaint will warrant 
no action. In any case, the depart
ment head reports on what, if any, 
action was taken.
A set-up such as the one des
cribed above will assure the stu
dent of an effective means of reg
istering his complaint, as well as 
assuring him that some action has 
been initiated. Since copies are 
sent to many authorities, pressure 
is bound to be brought to bear 
somewhere in the hierarchy, and 
the situation will be corrected, 
or, at least, scrutinized.
Student 
Senate Meeting
?
Wherrett Room 
A All Are Welcome I
The Faculty Senate petition 
suggested these measures; the 
Student Senate resolution demand
ed they be implemented. We call 
on our administration to employ 
these or other equally forceful 
measures to exert pressure for a 
just settlement, reads the fac
ulty statement.
We strongly believe the fol
lowing actions be implemented. 
... We call upon the university to 
act immediately, reads the state
ment passed by the Student Sen
ate.
In addition, the Student Senate 
resolution states: We recom
mend these university presidents 
seek an injunction for the courts 
to hald construction indefinitely 
because (1) The violation of fairemployment practices by the 
craft unions, and (2) The increas
ing possibilities of violence result
ing from actions by independent 
groups to close the construction 
sites.
If an injunction is obtained, the 
University would not be legally 
obligated to pay union workers 
who would be laid-off although 
rental costs for additional equip
ment (approximately $8,000 per 
day at C-MU) would still have to 
be paid.
The resolutions were delivered 
to Warner Hall by Wednesday 
morning. Because Dr. Stever was 
out of town until Friday no word 
was expected until he returned.
Wednesday afternoon, The TarTan received word that a group 
of students on campus were plan
ning a rally, march and shut down 
of construction sites on Monday 
morning, Sept. 22, at 9:20 p.m. 
The group plans to stop construc
tion and block supply lines in front 
of Scaife and Machinery Halls by 
a peaceful demonstration. The 
students indicated that they would 
need approximately 200 demon
strators in order to be effective.
The demonstration will be 
peaceful and non-violent, the stu
dents said. We plan to have stu
dent marshals patroling the sitin.
The group further stated that 
the rally would be cancelled if 
they got word that the Black Con
struction Coalition decided at a 
closed Wednesday night meeting 
that the action would not be bene
ficial to their cause. We would 
also halt our plans if the adminis
tration closed the construction 
sites and issued a strong state
ment in support of the Black Coali
tion, they added.
In an attempt to discover wheth
er or not the Coalition was in sup
port of university action on their 
behalf, The Tartan spoke to Hal 
Robinson. He indicated that he 
could not issue a statement of the 
Coalitions desires until after the 
Wednesday night meeting and, 
perhaps, not until after a meeting 
of the Conference and Council of 
Churches Thursday night. The lat
ter was an open meeting.
For the next 24 hours we wish 
you would hold any actions, Mr. 
Robinson added Wednesday after
noon.
The committee called for by Dr. 
Stevers statement of Sept. 15 
comprised of three administra
tors, three faculty members and 
three students also met Wednes
day. Although all the issues were 
not discussed, no statement came 
from the committee. It recon
vened Thursday afternoon to fur
ther consider what university pro
cedures will work towards the 
ends in question.
Since Black Monday
After the two and one-half hour 
peaceful demonstration Sept. 15, 
Monday, talks resumed between 
the Master Builders, the unions 
and the Black Construction Coali
tion.
It was evident that the new of
fer by the contractors-unions was 
not at all satisfactory when the 
Coalition leaders walked out of 
the negotiation room, tore the of
fer into shreds and set it afire.
The unions and contractors pro
posed a study to survey the peo
ple in the minority community 
who wish to be considered under 
the program.
The offer continued to state 
that when the survey is completed 
we will sit down and review it.
In the meantime, unions in the 
Pittsburgh Building and Trades 
Council stand willing to accept 
all qualified journeymen in their 
respective crafts under the rules, 
regulations and by-laws of the re
spective unions involved.
The unions said that the plan 
had good points, although it 
needed further study.
The Coalition leaders, surpris
ed by the new proposal, said that 
it gave them nothing and that 
the union's action was unpar
donable. One negotiator said, I 
just want to let our people know 
they tricked us.
The latest Coalition proposal 
was also withdrawn from the bar
gaining table. That proposal call
ed for 2,200 to 2,500 blacks in 
the construction industry in five 
years.
The Coalition presented their 
previous proposal calling for 
blacks to fill 25 pei cent of un
ion memberships (7,500).
Dr. Norman Johnson, a Coali
tion negotiator and member of the 
C-MU faculty, was quoted in the 
Pittsburgh Press as saying that 
he would not try to justify the ac
tions of the unions.
The idea is that they did it. 
They came in here and said, You 
niggers go to hell. Now what are 
you niggers going to do about it.
They said, Do it the American 
way. So we did it the American 
way today (the peaceful demons
tration}. Then they must have sud(Continued on Page 7)

J ITERS TO THE EDITOR
Open Letter 
To the President
Editor, The Tartan:
Because of recent problems on 
this campus which seem related 
to the way it is being run I felt mo
tivated to send the following let
ter to President Stever.
Dear Dr. Stever,
As you are the chief represent
ative of C-MU I would like to thank 
you for the invitation I have re
ceived from C-MU and the East 
Hills Clan to hear you speak at the 
Fund for Distinction Dinner next 
Tuesday, Sept. 23, at the Holi
day House Motel. Such an event is 
certainly more than I could nor
mally afford and it should cer
tainly be interesting to hear 
about the Fund for Distinction 
and its importance to CarnegieMellon University as well as see
ing the new color film about the 
University and where it is going 
not to mention greeting you and 
meeting my area Fund for Dis
tinction leaders. You can be cer
tain that I will attend and that I 
will be most interested in finding 
out exactly where this University 
is going.
You see, Dr. Stever, I have been 
around here several years and in 
fact it had begun to look as if the 
University was going some place 
under your administration. How
ever, realizing that you are only 
one man and that C-MU policy is 
made in a number of complex 
ways of which you are only a part, 
I wish that you would again start 
addressing yourself tmthe real 
problem of where C-MU is head
ed. My perception of C-MU in the 
last few months is simply that it 
is going nowhere while problems 
continue to accumulate. Your re
cent statement on student riots is 
a perfect example for you have 
clearly stated what you would do 
in all contingencies and have done 
little if anything to prevent any of 
these contingencies from occuriing. For example I would point to 
the following issues:
First and most immediately 
important (and directly attribut
able to you) are your recent pro
nouncements  or lack thereof  
with respect to the Black Con
struction Coalition. This is clearly 
a point where the University could 
have gone somewhere in alle
viating a social injustice and pre
venting possible violence. Your 
refusal is simply difficult to un
derstand.
The problem of improper fore
sight by the administration has 
caused a problem in housing 
which necessitates students liv
ing in Webster Hall, and after 
other makeshift arrangements 
are made, these students will have 
to pick up in mid-semester and 
readjust to a new environment.
Another problem with planning 
in the University lies in the aca
demic realm (see Sept. 22 Tartan, 
Students Organize Against Psych 
Psych. Dept.). I take it as a prin
ciple that the University should 
provide a wide variety of learn
ing experiences and allow the stu
dent freedom to continually re
examine society and himself and 
re-examine his educational goals 
if necessary. Until students can 
in fact transfer between depart
ments we are a university in 
name only. The particular prob
lem with psychology had been no
ticed by psychology faculty for 
some time and, in fact, the depart
ment was closed last year to trans
fers. Nothing has been done be
tween last year and this year. A 
recent policy statement by the 
psychology department states that 
they simply dont have sufficient 
faculty for any more students.
This is not at issue. If this prob
lem was noticed last year why 
wasnt anything done? If more 
faculty are needed why werent 
they hired? If it is felt that this 
may only be a transient problem 
it is still a problem for some of 
our students and they need a tran
sient solution.
Yes, it will be interesting to 
hear about where C-MU is going. 
In three chief areas  involve
ment in the community which is 
our environment, providing an 
adequate living facility for learn
ing, and providing the kind of 
learning, that students in a uni
versity want  C-MU isnt going 
anywhere. This may have sounded 
like a lot of complaints (because 
it was) with no positive sugges
tions (which is what is expected 
from the trouble makers in my 
generation). Well here are a few 
ideas. How about having a little 
more foresight and quite a bit 
more planning. I would be perfect
ly happy to see C-MU move for
ward to being a true university 
and I really dont get any pleasure 
from complaining. But I really do 
think that C-MU and all of us 
would be better off if you, the ad
ministration, the faculty, and the 
students had a slightly different 
attitude about what the real prob
lems are that we face and where 
we should be moving to.
Respectively, 
Kenneth E. Friend 
Psychology Graduate Student
Psych Dept.
Editor, The Tartan:
I am quite sympathetic to the 
students who have not been per
mitted to transfer into the Psy
chology Department. One would 
think that a good university would 
be able to provide its students 
with the best possible educational 
experience from the available fa
cilities and staff. Im sure that 
this university would like to be 
able to allow its students to be 
able to decide what direction their 
education should take, but its re
sources do not easily shift with 
the changing interests of its stu
dents. The Department of Psy
chology would like to accept the 
students who wish to be admitted, 
but it will not do so at the expense 
of the quality of the education be
ing received by its current stu
dents.
Let me describe the present sit
uation. We have 110 psychology 
majors and about 180 E&S stu
dents who elected psychology as a 
minor. Twenty-seven faculty 
members are doing undergrad
uate teaching this semester. The 
average class size is 28 and eight 
sections have an enrollment over 
40. Most faculty members also 
supervise research and reading 
courses for individual undergrad
uate and graduate students and 
teach graduate courses. The de
partments feeling is that it is 
making maximum use of its cur
rent faculty and facilities and that 
opening the department to all who 
wish to transfer would produce 
a less satisfactory education sit
uation. For example, classes 
would be much larger and faculty 
would have less time to devote to 
individual students.
Given this situation, our cur
rent psychology majors might 
also object to an open depart
ment. They have been very vocal 
in expressing an interest in more 
independent study. There is also 
a considerable demand for more 
courses in the areas of social and 
clinical psychology, areas in 
which we are currently under
staffed.
The solution to this problem 
may appear to be obvious: ex
pand the facilities and hire addi
tional faculty. However, space 
does not simply spring from a de
partment heads head. It must be 
vacated by those who currently 
hold it and they usually are reluc
tant to do this. Neither can one 
simply decree the presence of ad
ditional faculty. Good ones are 
expensive and need research sup
port.
So that is where we now stand. 
Faculty, facilities, and a concern 
for our current majors must be 
considered before the department 
can be opened to large numbers of 
additional students. And we real
ly are sympathetic to those stu
dents who would like to major in 
psychology. We find it to be a stim
ulating, important, relevant dis
cipline and hardly want to turn off 
students who might some day 
make an important contribution 
in this area.
Sincerely, 
James H. Korn 
Chairman of Undergraduate 
Studies in Psychology
Newest Issue
Editor, The Tartan:
The newest issue to appear on 
campus concerns the opening of 
the psychology department. This 
department has been closed for 
nearly two years. The adminis
tration has yet to find a solution 
for the many students wishing to 
transfer into psychology, and the 
problem is growing.
The administration claims that 
the closing of the department was 
necessitated by the lack of re
sources  instructors, space, and 
especially, money  to accommo
date more students. A sudden in
flux now would create bigger 
classes and thus, less individual
ized attention for each present 
psych major. For this reason, the 
administration feels that the new 
transfer would be resented most 
by students now in the depart
ment.
In my opinion, it is the moral 
obligation of a University to pro
vide the type of education that 
each student desires. Each depart
ment in a university should have 
the same status and receive im
mediate attention when in need of 
it.
The administration seems to 
take the position that if one leaves 
a problem alone long enough, it 
will disappear. Rather, the ad
ministration should face up to its 
responsibilities.
It seems obvious that some stu
dent pressure is needed for this 
to occur. I urge all my psychology 
compatriots to join the present ef
fort to push for a solution to this 
problem.

Nixon Report Urges 
'Raise Grass Price
In an attempt to stop the flow 
of marijuana and other drugs into 
this country from Mexico, the 
Nixon administration announced 
this week that it hopes to use the 
economic laws of supply and de
mand to push the price of narcot
ics so high that students will not 
be able to afford them.
Deputy Attorney General Rich
ard G. Kleindienst said, It is not 
our objective to make thousands 
of arrests in the U.S. It is our ob
jective first to stop the flow of 
marijuana and heroin and danger
ous drugs across the border and 
secondly to eradicate production 
of these drugs in Mexico.
Mr. Kleindienst discussed the 
report of a presidential task force 
which recommended the use of 
aircraft, electronic equipment 
and chemical defoliants to stop 
the drug traffic. During the dis
cussion, he stood on a platform 
decorated with more than $1 mil
lion worth of confiscated mari
juana, hashish and opium.
The report was prepared by a 
22-member committee headed bh 
Mr. Kleindienst and Assistant Sec
retary Eugene Rossides.
The report focused on the flow 
of marijuana into the United 
States although it also recom
mended ways to reduce the flow 
of hard drugs.
Federal laws against marijuana 
smuggling should be revised to 
permit greater flexibility in the
prosecution, said the task force. 
It implied the present laws are so 
harsh that sometimes they cannot 
be enforeced.
The task force also urged the 
State Department to devote its 
efforts to persuading Mexico to 
place a program for the eradica
tion and control of marijuana and 
dangerous drugs among the high
est of its national priorities.
The question arose whether 
marijuana users would turn to 
street crimes to obtain money to 
purchase the higher priced drugs?
In reply, Mr. Kleindienst stated 
that since marijuana is not ad
dictive, we dont think that our 
students and young people will re
sort to crime in order to get it.
The task force further recom
mended increased inspection at 
the border to prevent importa
tion of illicit drugs. Mr. Klein
dienst said this might take the 
form of blitz campaigns to stop 
all traffic at the border.
Mr. Kleindienst said some of 
the reports recommendations 
have already been put into effect. 
For example, the Federal Avia
tion Administration now requires 
all light planes flying from Mexi
co to file flight plans to cut down 
on smuggling.
He added that the border patrol 
has acquired additional aircraft 
to pursue suspected aerial smug
glers.
DO YOU WANT AN OPEN PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT?
A group of interested students are forming on campus with 
the goal of resolving the problem created by the closing of 
the Psychology Department. This group needs information 
from students who wish to transfer into the department. If 
you are considering electing psychology as your major re
gardless of your year, complete this form and deposit it at 
the main desk in Skibo or Morewood.

Non-Violent Revolution 
Sought With Workshop
On Tuesday, Sept. 3, Sander Vanocur, news reporter from First Tues
day on NBC, will be speaking in the Ballroom of Skibo. After the speech 
there will be a luncheon held in Room 45. Tickets must be obtained by 
4 p.m. Monday afternoon in Room 103 at $1.75 per person.
by SARA COOPER
A workshop in Revolutionary 
Non-Violence is organizing on 
campus to create a conscious
ness and an understanding of non
violence, said John Agatston, 
spokesman for the group.
As the only politicac group at 
Carnegie, the Revolutionary NonViolence organization plans to 
specifically learn about non-vio
lence and also to take action, 
through open forums and march
es, on local, civic and national 
crisis. Agatston feels that the an
ti-war marches and demonstra
tions along with an open-dialogue 
in discussion groups will facili
tate an understanding of social
ism, imperialism, the credibility 
gap and other major issues on the 
world scene.
Agatston explained that the 
term non-violence is a method
or tactic for a way of life; a reli
gion where the means must be 
consistent with the ends. Revol
utionary Non-Violence is that 
state where the means and the 
ends are the same and can be in
terchanged. The goal is to start 
now when an individual can live 
these means, reacting to local 
means through action. You must 
find love and truth in all human 
beings to regain the power of 
faith, said Agatston.
The Revolutionary Non-Vioence organization has planned to 
march through the Pittsburgh 
area on Oct. 15 and Nov. 13, 14, 
and 15 for a moratorium on the 
war in Vietnam. Our original the
ory is to obtain a national general 
strike for the war, explained 
Agatston.
The groups has also planned an 
Oct. 31 march for the California
grape pickers, a Resistance Night, 
an open forum on campus affairs 
(ROTC, dormitory regulatons, 
curriculum) an open coffee house 
on the weekends for discussion 
groups and a literature table now 
located in the lobby of Skibo.
All interested persons are urged 
to attend a planning meeting for 
the seminar in Revolutionary 
Non-Violence in Skibo, room 45, 
on Thursday, Sept. 18. Monday, 
Sept. 22, there will be an organ
izational meeting for the Vietnam 
moratorium.

This note takes a stick rather 
than a carrot approach to the 
problem of indiscipline, which 
threatens suspension of the aca
demic effectiveness of several 
leading American universities, 
and which has already suspend
ed the effectiveness of numerous 
foreign ones. Despite this reac
tionary approach, it should not bknt 
existence of reasonable student 
grievances, or decrying concilia
tory methods of countering stu
dent rebellion. It forms, in other 
words, only one neglected part of 
an over-all package.
Student indiscipline arieses, in 
the recurrent presence of student 
grievances, whenever its econom
ic consequences to the students 
appear sufficiently negligible. At 
least, so I conclude from casual 
familiarity with its recent history, 
both in the United States and in 
one foreign country (Japan).
It seems at least plausible, then, 
for any campus counter-insurgency program to include some filter
ing mechanism which would im
pose aneconomic, or career, pen
alty against the more violent ele
ments in the student protest move
ment. The filter wou NOT BE, ANE 
NEED NOT BE, A LIFETIME SEP 
TO UNEMPLOY luiTNT. A short-te 
sentence to an inferic job is all 
that is necessary, in prosperous 
times.
Let there be no misunderstand
ing one one point. No career filter 
imposed today or yesterday, ex 
post, could change Marv Savio. 
Jerry Rube, or Markrkd into 
George F. Babbitt, Jr. Savio, Ru
bin, and Rudd have already re
nounced any interest in selling 
out to the stablishment. (They 
alos tend to leave the mundane 
and higher-rish illegalities of 
building-occupation, record-bucing, and general vandalism to 
their underlings, in a New Left 
version of Generals Die in 
Bed.) This issue is, where do 
these underlings themselves come 
from, to lay their bodies on the 
line?
The major target of any career 
filter should be precisely those 
underlings and potential under
lings, those bodies on the line. It 
should be the disvuragement of 
the Movements rear-rank pri
vates from the extremes-of con
frontation policies. It should be 
the deflation of defusing of acti
vism to thehoothlessness of All 
Chiefs and No Indians, by dis
couraging the Indians. Further
more  who knows  career filt
ering might even have kept a few 
Chiefs, in their Indian years, from 
pursuing their respective war
paths past their respective points 
of no return.
A Career Filter
The career filter I have in mind 
is a simple one. It is already in 
partial existence on some cam
puses. The activists are already 
afraid of it, and seek its elimina
tion.
An effective career filter be
gins with systematic recording of 
each students disciplinary rec
ord, both on campus and in the 
surrounding area. (Mississippi, 
Selma, and the Pentagon would 
doubtless remain off limits, like 
Fort Lauderdale in springtime.) 
Local police and sheriffs offices 
would presumably assist the cam
pus copts in keeping dossiers com
plete and up to date. Arrests, 
chages, dismissals of charges, 
acquittals, suspended sentences, 
should be all included along with 
convictions and academic penal
ties, on the principle that:
Tis N.. u,eu u,N Aoau ep*o6u u,NNB 
gNaN lN9u u ,eDN rNDNa lNNr
ua6N5t:
At the next stage of the career 
filter, the students disciplinary 
record should be submitted to po
tential employers, including grad
uate and professional schools, 
whenever the student chooses to 
submit his academic credentials 
to them. A student can therefore 
avoid the filter entirely, by for
feiting whatever advatage super
ior grades may give him. What 
the prospective employer does 
with this information is his own 
affar.
If a sufficient proportion of 
prestigous cmpanies, public 
agencies, law schools, business 
schools, etc., take a bad disciplin
ary record seriously, and are 
known to take it seriously, this 
would discourage student rioting 
and violence quite generally, in 
the same way that concern with 
admissvn to prestige colleges 
now holds down activism at col
lege-preparatory academies and 
suburban high schools. If a num
ber of glamorous concerns should 
join together in publiciqng black
list policies against activist stu
dents, or requirements of proba
tionary good conduct periods 
betwef college graduation and 
consideration for employmrnt, 
this is all to the good. (Does it not
seem strange that chemical com
panies as a group have never dis
criminated against campuses fail
ing to protect Dow Chemical re
cruiters?)
In practice, the greatey dgree 
of eventual cocec with studm 
ksciplinakbe expovernme, and from
graduate kprofessional schools, 
rahter than from the businss 
community in general. Schools 
and public bodis have vestfinterests in campus law and ordeThej 
abilities to either bq off or civilizetever troublemkers 
they may mistaknly accept. 
Hence their greater concec with 
avoiding mistakesin the firstvlace.
Student afeguards
Adequate safeguards for stu
dents civil rights should always 
be included in any filtering me
chanism. Any student should not 
only be able to ascertain the con
tents of his disciplinary record, 
but should have the right to insert 
rebuttals to any entry he consi
ders derogatory. The record 
should be limited strictly to illegal 
activities. Dangerous thoughts, 
organization memberships, per
sonal eccentricities of dress or 
appearance should all be exclud
ed. Also excluded should be in
formal charges contained in per
sonal communications to police 
departments or university offi
cials. The only confidential ma
terial included should be letters 
of recommendation requested by 
the student himself.
Dangerous Alternatives
Students generally, and not only 
student activists, instictively op
pose proposals like this one, how
ever, carefully safeguarded. Far 
from including off-campus police 
information, university records 
should in their view be purged of 
all disciplinary whatever. The 
American Association of Univer
sity Professors has also gone along 
with this positionmistakenly, in 
my opinion.
In the short run, the students 
fears are understandable. In the 
long run, however, the filter me
chanism suggested here may be 
preferable to its probable alter
natives.
What are some of these alterna
tives? Let us assume that an em
ployer, or a graduate school, does 
not want activists until they have 
served a few years probation or 
penitence after graduation  in 
the Movement, in Hippieland, or 
working for Papa. Assume also 
that their answers to questions
like Have you ever been arrest
ed? Has any disciplinary action 
ever been instituted against you? 
are incompletely honest. In the 
absence of disciplinary records, 
the employer has several courses 
of action. He can, and often, will 
give up and do nothing, and accept 
whatever his applicants choose to 
tell him. This is what the activists 
hope for  instant career amnesty 
at no price beyond a shave, a hair
cut, and a shoe shine. The system 
appears to work almost that way 
in Japan. But consider the other 
alternatives open to the employ
er  particularly the prestigious 
employer. He can reject anyone 
who attended Berkeley, or Colum
bia, or San Francisco State, or 
Howard, in certain years. He can 
transfer to the hapless applicant 
the burden of demonstrating his 
own anti-SDS or antiYIP allegi
ance, preferably by proving ac
tive opposition to such organiza
tions. The employer can also in
quire privately about the appli
cant from someone on the appli
cants campus, who may be in a 
position to learn a few salient de
tails of his college career. It is 
on this informal-informer system, 
as a likely alternative to formal 
university career filters, that we 
should concentrate our attention.
I have already gained a few ene
mies by admitting a reluctant 
willingness to serve as an inform
al informer, when formal records 
contain insufficient disciplinary 
information for career-filter pur
poses. I nevertheless admit that 
the informing business is a shady 
one, deserving a substantial frac
tion of its unsavory reputation. In
formers may dredge up all kinds 
of rumor, relating to member
ships, opinions, and idiosyncracies along with illegal actions. The 
applicant has no chance to refute, 
or even see, this collection of rum
or. Indeed, its truth and relevance 
are subject to no tests whatso
ever.
The formal career filter, accom
panying the students academic 
record and relying for its effec
tiveness on the economics of the 
students situation, seems on bal
ance less threatening to student 
rights and liberties than any al
ternative which protects the uni
versities from disruption. In fact, 
its principal weakness appears to 
be its incomplete and imperfect 
preclusion of the several unde
sirable alternatives. We may, 
however, hope, that the career 
filter may prove both cheap and 
effective enough to minimize both 
employers use of harsher alter
natives and our universities 
danger of following the paths of 
Tokyo and Caracas.
The Short Run
The short run, as happens all 
too often in economics, is another 
problem. Let me paraphrase an 
objection from colleagues on sev
eral campuses: If any of our 
graduate or professional schools 
turned down activists from any
where, or if we helped employers 
discriminate against our own ac
tivists, this would be just the ex
cuse they have been looking for. 
They would shut our campus down 
tight as a drum, and vandalize a 
few buildings while doing so.
My closest approach to an an
swer, where the argument itself 
is plausible and dangerous, is to 
wait for the longer run. This is a 
piece of standard economic jar
gon, often used as a substitute for 
thought. What it means in the pre
sent context is that the universi
ty may have to delay any formal 
career filtering system. The delay 
will have to last until sprading dis
ruption on the one hand, or spread
ing informer systems and employ
er boyscotts of entire universities 
on the other, have made the sit
uation bad enough to make the ca
reer filter practical. If, by some 
miracle, the disruption problem is 
kind enought to evaporate or dis
appear in the interim, so much the 
better, until next time. If the uni
versities collapse instead, so 
much the worse and I told you so. 
but I should have told you so soon
er.

Page 4THE TARTANFriday, September 19, 1969The Student As Niftier
by
Jerry Frber
Students are niggers. When 
you get that straight, our school 
begins to make sense. Its more 
important, though, to understand 
why theyre niggers. If we follow 
that question seriously enough, it 
will lead us past the zone of aca
demic bullshit, where dedicated 
teachers pass their knowledge on 
to a new generation, and into the 
nitty-gritty of human needs and 
hangups. And from there we can 
go on to consider whether it 
might ever be possible for students 
to come up from slavery.
First lets see whats happen
ing now. Lets look at the role 
students play in what we like to 
call education.
.........Into The Cafeteria
At Cal State L.A., where I teach, 
the students have separate and un
equal dining facilities. If I take 
them into the faculty dining 
room, my colleagues get uncom
fortable, as though there were a 
bad smell. If I eat in the student 
cafeteria, I become known as the 
educational equivalent of a nig
ger lover. In at least one building 
there are even rest rooms which 
students may not use. At Cal 
State, there is an unwritten law 
barring student - faculty lovemaking. Fortunately, this anti
miscegenation law, like its South
ern counterpart, is not 100 per 
cent effective.
Academic Lowndes County
Students at Cal State are polit
ically disnefranchised. They are 
in an academic Lowndes County. 
Most of them can vote in national 
elections - their average age is about 26-but they have no voice in 
the decisions which affect their 
academic lives. The students are, 
it is true, allowed to have a toy 
government run for the most part 
by Uncle Toms and concerned 
principally with trivia. The fac
ulty and administrators decide 
what courses will be offered; the 
students get to choose their own 
Homecoming Queen. Occasional
ly when student leaders get up
pity and rebellious, they ' re 
either ignored, put off with tri
vial concessions, or manoeuvered 
expertly out of position.
Hell Fail Your Ass
A student at Cal State is ex
pected to know his place. He calls 
a faculty member Sir,or Doc
tor or Professor - and he 
smiles and shuffles some as he 
stands outside the professors of
fice waiting for permission to en
ter. The faculty tell him what to 
read, what to write, and, frequen
tly. where to set the margins on 
his typewriter. They tell him 
whats true and what isnt. Some 
teachers insist that they encour
age dissent but theyre almost al
ways jiving and every student 
knows it. Tell the man what he 
wants to hear or hell fail your 
ass out of the course.
When a teacher says jump,' 
students jump. I know of one 
professor who refused to take up 
class time for exams and requir
ed students to show up for tests 
at 6:30 in the morning. And they 
did. by God. Another, at exam 
time, provides answer cards to be 
filled out-each one enclosed in a 
paper bag with a hole cut in the 
top to see through. Students stick 
their writing hands in the bags 
while taking the test. The teach
er isnt a provo; I wish he were. 
He does it to prevent cheating. 
Another colleague once caught 
a student reading during one of 
his lectures and threw her book 
against the wall. Still another lec
tures his students into a stupor and 
then screams at them in a Rage 
when they fall asleep 
Just last week during the first 
meeting of a class, one girl got up 
to leave after about ten minutes 
had gone by. The teacher rushed 
over, grabbed her by the arm. 
saying This class is NOT dis
missed! and led her back to her 
seat. On the same day another 
teacher began by informing his 
class that he does not like beards, 
mustaches long hair on boys, or 
capri pants on girls, and will not 
tolerate any of that in his class. 
The class, incidentally, consisted 
mostly of high school teachers.
Even more discouraging than 
this Auschwitz approach to edu
cation is the fact that the students 
take it.They havent gone through 
twelve years of public school for 
nothing. Theyve learned one 
thing during those twelve years. 
Theyve forgotten their algebra. 
Theyre hopelessly vague about 
chemistry and physics. Theyve 
grown to fear and resent liter
ature. They write like theyve 
been lobotomized. But, Jesus, can 
they follow orders! Freshmen come 
up to me with an essay and ask 
if I want it folded, and whether 
their name should be in the up
per right hand corner. And I want 
to cry and kiss them and caress 
their poor tortured heads.
Two Truths
Students dont ask that orders 
make sense. They give up expect
ing things to make sense long be
fore they leave elementary school. 
Things are true becausd the teach
er says theyre true. At a very 
early age we all learn to accept 
two truths. as did certain med
ieval churchmen. Outside of class 
things are true to your tongue, 
your fingers, your stomach, your 
heart.Inside class, things are true 
by reason of authority. And that's 
just fine because you don't care 
anyway. Miss Wiedemever tells 
you a noun is a person, place or 
thing. So let it be. You don't give 
a rats ass; she doesnt give a rats 
ass.
The important thing is to please 
her. Back in kindergarten, you 
found out that teachers only love 
children who stand in nice straight 
lines. And thats where it's been 
at ever since. Nothing changes ex
cept to get worse. School becomes 
more and more obiviously a prison 
Last year I spoke to a student 
assembly at Manual Arts High 
School and then couldnt get out 
of the god-dam school. I mean 
there was NO WAY OUT. Lock
ed doors. High fences. One of the 
inmates was trying to make it 
over a fence when he saw me 
coming and froze in panic. For a 
moment I expected sirens, a rat
tle of bullets, and him claw, 
ing the fence.
is a 12-year course in how to be 
slaves. What else could explain 
what I see in a freshman class? 
Theyve got that slave mentality: 
obliging and ingratiating on the 
surface but hostile and resistent 
underneath.
As do black slaves, students 
vary in their awareness of wiiat's 
going on. Some recognize their 
own put - on for what it is and 
even let their rebellion break 
through to the surface now and 
then. Others - including most of 
the good students" - have been 
more deeply brainwashed. They 
swallow the bullshit with greedy 
mouths. They honest - to - God 
believe in grades, in busy work, 
in General Education require
ments. They're pathetically eager 
to be pushed around. They're like 
those old grey - headed house nig
gers you can still find in the South 
who don't see what all the fuss 
is about because Mr. Charlie 
treats us real good.
College entrance requirements 
tent to favor the Toms and screen 
out the rebels. Not entirely, of 
course. Some students at Cal State 
L. A. are expert conartists who 
know perfectly well whats hap
pening. They want the degree or 
the 2-S anpapwnd their years on 
the old plantation alternately 
laughing and cursing as they play 
the game. If their egos are strong 
enough, they cheat a lot. And of 
course, even the Toms are angry 
down deep somewhere. But it cojes out in passive witted and sub
ject to frequent spells of laziness. 
They mis-read simple questions. 
They spend their nights mechani
cally outlining history chapters 
while meticulously failing to com
prehend a word of whats in front 
of them.
No Spades in Pointy Shoes
Then there's the infamous 
code of dress. In some high 
schools, if your skirt looks too 
short, you have to kneel before 
the principal, in a brief allegory 
of fellatio. If the hem doesn't 
reach the floor, you go home to 
change while he. presumably, 
jacks off.Bovs in high school can't 
be too sloppy and they can t even 
be too sharp. You'd think the 
school board would be delighted 
to see all the spades trooping to 
school in pointy shoes, suits, ties 
and stigy brims. Uh-uh. They're 
too visible.
What school amounts to. then, 
for white and black kids alike.
Fresh Pimples
The saddest cases among both 
black slaves and student slaves 
are the ones who have so thoro
ughly introjected their masters' 
values that their anger is all turn
ed inward. At Cal State these 
are the kids for whom every low 
grade is torture, who stammer and 
shake when they speak to a pro
fessor. who go through an emo
tional crisis every time they're 
called upon during class. You can 
recognize them easily at finals 
time. Their faces are festooned 
with pimples; their bowels boil 
audibly across the room. If there 
really is a Last Judgement, then 
the parents and teachers who cre
ated these wrecks are going to 
burn in hell.
So students are niggers. It's 
time to find out why. and to do 
this we have to take a look at 
Mr. Charlie.
Thd teachers I know best are 
college professors. Outside the 
classroom and taken as a group, 
their most striking characteristic 
is timidity. Theyre short on balls.
Just look at their working condi
tions. At a time when even mi
grant workers have begun to fight 
and win, college professors are 
still afraid to make more than a 
token effort to improve their piti
ful econimic status. They lie flat 
on their stomachs with their pants 
down, mumbling catch phrases 
like professional dignity ' and 
meaningful dialogue. "
Short On Balls
At any rate, teachers ARE short 
on balls. And. as Judy Eisenstein 
has eloquently pointed out. the 
classroom offers an artificial and 
protected environment in which 
they can exercise their will to 
power. Your neighbors may drive 
a better car; gas station attendants 
may intimidate you: the State Leg
islature may shit on you: your 
wife may dominate you; but in the 
classroom, by God. students do 
what you say- or else. The grade 
is a hell of a weapon. It may not 
rest on your hip. potent and ri
gid like a cop s gun. but in the 
long run it s more powerful.
At your personal whim - any 
time you choose - you can keep 
35 students up for nights and have 
the pleasure of seeing them walk 
into the classroom pasty-faced and 
red-eved carrying a sheaf of type
written pages, with title page. M 
LA footnotes, and margins set at 
15 and 91.
The general timidity which 
causes teachers to make niggers 
of their students usually includes 
a more specific fear - fear of the 
students themselves. After- all. 
students are different, just like 
black people. You stand exposed 
in front of them, knowing that 
their interests, their values, and 
their language are different from 
vours. To make matters worse, 
you may suspect that you your
self are not the most engaging 
of persons. What. then, can pro
tect you from their ridicule and 
scorn?
Respect for authority. That's 
what. It's the policeman's gun 
again. The white bwanas pith hel
met. So you flaunt that authority. 
You wither wisperors with a mur
derous glance. You crush objec
tors with erudition and heavy 
irony. And. worst of all. you make 
your own attainments seem not 
accesible but awesomely remote. 
You conceal your massive ig
norance - and prade a slender 
learning.
Killing Literature
The teacher's fear is mixed with 
an understandable need to be ad
mired and to feel superior-a need 
which also makes him cling to his 
"white supermacv. ' Ideally, a 
teacher should minimize the dis
tance between himself and his 
students. He should encourage 
them not to need him- eventual
ly or even immediately. But this 
is rarely the case. Teachers make 
themselves high priests of arcane 
mysteries. They become masters 
of mumbo - jumbo. Even a more 
or less conscientious teacher may 
be torn between the need to give 
and the need to hold back, be
tween the desire to free his stu
dents and the desire to hold them 
in bondage to him.
A Whole Lot of Niggers
You can add sexual repression 
to the list of causes, along with 
vanity, fear, and will to power, 
that turn the teacher into Mr. 
Charlie. You might also want to 
keep in mind that he was a nig
ger once himself and has never 
really gotten over it. And there 
are more causes, some of which 
are described better in sociologi
cal than in psychological terms. 
Work them out. it s not hard. But 
in the meantime, what we've got 
on our hands is a whole lot of nig
gers. And what makes this parti
cularly grim is that the student 
has less chance than the black 
man of getting out of his bag. 
Because the student doesn't even 
know hes in it. That, more or 
less, is what's happening in high
er education. And the results are 
staggering
At my school, we even grade 
poeple on how they read poetry. 
Thats like grading people on how 
they fuck. But we do it In fact. 
God help me. I do it. I'm the 
Adolph Eichmann of English 323. 
Simon Legree on the poetry plan
tation. Tote that Lamb!  Lift that 
spindee!" Even to discuss a good 
poem in that environment is porentially dangerous because the 
very classroom is contaminated. 
As hard as I may try to turn stu
dents on to poetry. I know that 
the desks, the tests, the IBM 
Cards, their own attitudes toward 
school, and my own residue ot 
UCLA method are turning them 
off.
Another result of student s!a\- 
verv is equally serious. Students
don't get emancipated when they 
graduate. As a matter of fact, 
we don't let them graduate until 
they've demonstrated there wil
lingness-over 16 years- to remain 
slaves. And for important jobs, 
like teaching, we make them go 
through more years just to make 
sure. What I'm getting at is that 
we re all more or less niggers and 
slaves, teachers and students alike. That is a fact you want to 
start with in trying to understand 
wider school phenomena, say. pol
itics. in our country and in other 
countries.
Educational oppression is tric
kier to fight than racial oppres
sion. If youre a black rebel, they 
cant exile you: they either intim
idate you or kill you. But in high 
school or college they can just 
bounce you out of the fold. And 
they do.
Rebel students and renegard 
faculty members get smothered 
or shot down with devestating ac
curacy. In high school, it s usual
ly the student who gets it; in col
lege it's more often the teacher. 
Others get tired of fighting and 
voluntarily leave the system. This 
may be a mistake though. Drop
ping out of college for a rebel is 
like going North for a Negro. You 
can't really get away from it so 
vou might as well stav and raise 
hell.
How do you raise hell That's 
a whole other article. But just for 
a start, why not stay with the an
alogy? What have black people 
done9 They have, first of all. fac
ed the fact of their slavery. They
've stopped kidding themselves about an eventual reward in that 
Great Watermelon Patch in the 
Sky. They've organized: they've 
decided to get freedom now. and 
they've started taking it.
Students like black people, 
have immense unused power. 
They could, theoretically, insist 
on participating in their own edu
cation. They could make academic 
freedom bilateral. They could 
teach their teachers to thrive on 
love and admiration, rather than 
fear and respect, and to lay down 
their weapons. Students could dis
cover community. And they could 
learn to dance by dancing on the 
IBM cards. They could make col
oring books out of the catalogs 
and put the graping system in a 
museum. They could raze one set 
of walls and let life come blowing into the classroom. They could 
raze another set of walls and let 
education glow out and flood the 
streets. They could turn the class
rooms into where it's at- a field 
of action as Peter Marin descri
bes it. And believe it or not. they 
could study eagerly and learn pro
digiously for the best of all pos
sible reasons- their own reasons.
They could. Theoretically. They 
have the power. But only in a very 
few places, like Berkelv. have 
they even begun to think about 
using it. For students, as for black 
people, the hardest battle isnt 
with Charlie. It s with what Mr. 
Charlie has done to vour mind.

The Amusing Photographs
-bv Drew Silver
O6rN 9a56Na9 out w uNr eaN lar 
w.9t George Bernard Shaw
This incident occurred during 
my first week in the base camp of 
the Fourth Infantry Division in 
Pleiku, Vietnam, and may or may 
not be significant. I am unable to 
decide.
I had come through the 22nd 
Replacement Battalion at Camp 
Ranh and I had been through the 
training cycle of the Fourth Re
placement Detachment. I had then 
xeen assigned to the Fourth Ad
ministration Company and was to 
work in an office of the division 
AG.
The first night in camp, my 
third in the country, the camp had 
been hit by a rocket attack. It 
scared the held out of me. Seven 
nights later, my first night in the 
Fourth Administration Company, 
we were hit again.during this lat
ter attack some sappers had come 
through the widre to blow up a few 
helicopters on their pads just in
side the perimeter. They had set 
some stchel charges in place and 
were on their way out through the 
wire when they were spotted by 
the half-asleep perimeter guards. 
The guards opened up on them 
with M-16s and machine guns. All 
but one got away; that one was 
killed in the wire, half of his head 
blown away, and most of one arm 
and leg, exposing muscles, bones, 
and cartilage. A large part of his 
chest was gone also. You could see 
what was left of his lungs, his 
heart, his intestines, and internal 
organs, although you could hardly 
tell which was which, protuding 
nakedly from his corpse, stiffing 
in the open air. He wore only a 
pair of black shorts and was un
armed except for his little sack of 
explosives, now empty. You could 
see his shattered brains. He was 
stiff and there was the slight trace 
of a painful expression visible on 
his remnant of a face. His long 
hair was matted and he was cov
ered with blood and filth. Pictures 
were taken of him the next morn
ing by the Fourth Division Public 
Information Office.
One of the other clerks in my of
fice was friendly with of the pro
cessors who developed photo
graphs in the PIO and obtained 
from him copies of two of the pic
tures that had been taken of the 
late enemy. He thought them vast
ly amusing and circulated them 
eagerly among his friends, show
ing them proudly around the of
fice and the mess hall. Everyone 
wanted to see the.
One day he showed them to Pa
pa-san. According to his ID card 
Papa-san was nearly 60 years old; 
he worked in our office as an officsboy and general lackey, em
ptying wastebaskets and other
wise contributing to the allied war 
effort. He bummed cigarettes con
stantly and shuffled around si
lently with a Vietnames broom 
and an American dust pan. He had 
the instincts of an Oriental Stepin 
Fetchit; his grin was ingratiating, 
servile, and false. When he was 
not with the GIs, Papa-san never 
smiled. He was a morose and un
happy old man, bent and shrivel
ed, wearing castoff American 
army clothing. He was shown the 
pictures by several grinning, 
snickering GFs.
Papa-san looked at them a 
long time and then went outside to 
squat in the shade of the building 
and smoke a Salem from the pack 
I had, illegally, given him earlier 
that morning in an attempt to 
make friends with him. Well, no, 
I knew better than to think I could 
make friends with him, at least 
by giving him cigarettes; I gave 
him the cigarettes because he 
wanted the cigarettes. As I say, I 
knew better. But I digress. When
he went outside and smoked his 
cigarette he said nothing and did 
not smile.
The fun-loving soldier and his 
laughing friends went to our hooch 
at lunch time to show the pic
tures to the Vietnamese hooch 
maids. There were three of them 
in our hooch at that time; Mai, San 
and Nam. San always wore a 
sleeveless sweater even on the 
hottest days and was shy, quiet, 
and pretty. Nam was friendly 
enough. Mai was loud, voluxle, 
and the ringleader and unofficial 
boss lady of all the hooch maids 
in the company. Somehow she had 
them all working for her. I have 
no way to prove it now but I as
sumed at the time that she had 
xeen around the Americans the 
longest.
The soldiers showed the pic
tures to Mai first as she had the 
shortest temper. You could al
ways get a few laughts by teasing 
Mai. When she saw the pictures 
of the dead Vietnamese soldier 
she began to shout in rapid Viet
namese and tried to tear them 
up. Whats the matter? in
quired a GI in mock surprise. 
You didnt like your borther-inlaw anyway, did you? Mai shout
ed even more rapidly and loudly 
at this and turned away, cursing 
and railing angrily at the soldiers 
in Vietnamese and pidgin English. 
She had a remarkably fluent com
mand of Anglo-Saxon profanity. 
She left the hooch and continued 
to shout and curse at the GIs even 
as she washed their socks and un
derwear in the hot sun. The sol
diers thought this tremendously 
funny. They always did. They al
ways thought Mais temper was 
funny.
When San saw the pictures she 
moaned and went away. When 
Nam saw them she didnt say any
thing, being friendly enough, but 
continued to iron the soldiers 
jungle fatigues.
When the GI who owned the pic
tures got all the amusement from 
them that was to be had he hung 
one of them in his wall locker and 
sent the other to his wife in Cali
fornia. Her reaction to it is un
known to me.

Library Changes Policy
Circulation Vo Books
With the beginning of a new school year, Hunt Library has instituted 
a changed policy for circulapon. Formerly, books were charged out 
only until 9 p.m. when graduate students took over the desk and reg
ular staff left the library. This year, students will be permitted to bor
row from the library up until closing time, 12:45 p.m. The change, 
however, applies only to open-stack and regularly catalogued materi
als. (No Government Documents, Research Reports, Vertical file ma
terials or Reserve materials will go out after 9 p.m.)
Another important library renovation is the installation of three 
five cent photo copying machines. The changeover from the ten 
cent machines was brought about simply to benefit the students pocketbook. The new copiers are located in the Reserve Room and on the 
third and fourth floors. The quarter changing machines are at present 
located near the first and third floor machines, and a third will be in
stalled soon on the fourth floor as well. For those who still wish to copy 
materials on bond quality paper, one remaining Xerox machine at ten 
cents per copy is located in the basement.
Several advantages come to mind with the installation of the new 
machines. First, of course, they are more economical and students 
sharing classes and research projects will be able to pool their money 
and their copied materials for greater advantage in studying. Also, 
the Reserve Room location provides the opportunity to copy pages from 
books that may not be taken out of the room. We thank the library for 
two renovations which make its books and other materials more acces
sible to the student body.
Skills Center 
Aids Studies 
With Students
A new student service, the Study 
Skills Center, began full-time op
eration at C-MU this month. Ac
cording to Dr. Ruth Beach, direc
tor of the Center, the Study Skills 
Center was established to help stu
dents identify academic problems 
that originate in poor study habits, 
inefficient time management, poor 
reading skills, and the like. Serv
ice at the Center is free and avail
able to ail C-MU undergraduates.
When a student comes to the 
Study Skills Center for aid, he is 
assigned a counselor. During the 
course of a series of interviews 
and tests, the student and counse
lor attempt to diagnose the nature 
of the problem. The number of in
terviews required to identify the 
problem and discuss approaches 
to solving it may vary with the in
dividual student.
Once the difficulty has been lo
cated, the counselor will recom
mend corrective measures for he 
student to follow. For example, 
students whose trouble lies in in
efficient use of time will be help
ed to establish and maintain effi
cient time schedules; students 
who lack good study skills are giv
en frequent study practice ses
sions. The sessions can end when
ever the counselor and student 
feel that he no longer needs them. 
The Center does not, however, 
provide either remedial instruc
tion or tutorial services.
The Study Skills Center is lo
cated in 148 Baker Hall (phone 
683-0793). The office is staffed by 
Mrs. Ruth Weisberg, secretaryoffice manager, and two study 
counselors, Frank Colosimo and 
Mrs. Shoshanna Rosenberg. Of
fice hours are from 8:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Excerpt from Part One of The Black Moochie, 
a novell by Eldridge Cleaver.
My youth, the foundation years of my life.
Rose Hill Chinga 
Neighborhood of fantastic people 
People of my life 
People who own my heart 
Peopl of Rse Hill 
You I remember and love.
Those of you who shared mutual 
Hste with me 
I forgive you 
I beg you to forgive me 
We need each other;
We are all that we bave
You live on in my memoryIve carried you with me all these years
Ive carried you in love
To understand your lives
Back when our neighborhood was a prize-winning 
hamlet
Black when we wore the name Rose Hill with 
pride
Part of Los Angeles but whole unto ourselves.
When Peter Chavez was killed in war we all 
mourned 
We came to see his casket 
To make the wake with his family.
Peter was of us 
Peter was Rose Hill 
Rose Hill Chinga
When that car plunged over the hill 
Going round the bend behind Burts store 
and crashed down on Mercury Avenue 
The crash belonged to all of us 
It burned into our souls equally.
When Lupes father was found dead 
A part of Rose Hill was found dead 
A part of Rose Hill talked about itself 
Rose Hill Chinga
With shanty pads squatting on mud hills 
People of this earth trudging up muddy paths 
To their houses
Slipping and sliding in the mud 
Walking on the grass to keep from falling, 
to keep ones footing 
Sweet smells of the earth when the grass was 
green 
No smog in Rose Hill
Farm from the industrial heart of Los Angeles 
A forgotten hamlet 
A peaceful spot 
Site of home
A jealous love of our sacred ground 
We Were bound to each other.
With what pride we owned the land 
We knew Rose Hill as our own 
Wed bow down on hands and knees to kiss our dirt 
The birds in the sky were ours 
The Housing Project was ours 
The garbage collectors once each Week were ours 
The milk man making his rounds in the morning 
mist of dew was ours 
The mailman delivering the mail was ours 
The Good Humor Ice Cream man with his musical 
wagon was ours 
The Helms Bakery Man with his musical wagon 
was ours
The planes flying overhead were ours 
The Catholic Church on Murcury Avenue was ours 
The Protestant Church on Boundary Avenue 
was ours
The Negro Church on Junipero Street was ours 
The corn the old men sowed in the hills was ours 
The walnuts growing wild in the hills were ours 
The apricot trees in our years were ours 
The fires that burned the dried grass each year 
were ours 
The beauty of our women was ours 
The strength of our men was ours 
The squeals, laughter and tears of the children 
were ours 
We had a sense of ourselves.
We said Rose Hill and we meant all things in it.
Black Monday March 
Makes Little Progress
The first Black Monday has come and gone. It was a day high
lighted first by a very orderly, very non-violent march of Black 
Coalition supporters through downtown Pittsburgh and then by a 
humiliating rejection of the Coalitions demands by the negotiators 
for the construction unions.
The Black Monday march began at 8:25 a.m. when the 3,500 
people, half of them white, left Freedom Corner (a name given to 
the intersection of Center Avenue and Crawford Street) and moved 
along Center Avenue into downtown Pittsburgh. Even though the pro
cession was lead by a vanguard carrying the flag of Black militance 
there were no violent actions taken by either marchers or police who 
followed along side on motorcycles ready to move quickly if there 
was any trouble. The demonstration was so quiet that aside from block
ing intersections and an occasional spurt of chanting or out of time 
clapping, it might have passed unnoticed.
The only moments of tension occured when protesters encircled 
the construction site of the new U.S. Steel Building. But the construc
tion workers as they would show later that day, were unconcerned by 
the gathering. Since nothing was thrown and the marshals, assigned 
to keep order in the ranks, could not seem to rouse evena unified 
shout out of the crowd the chance for even a noisy ending to what was 
otherwise an almost dull show of force soon passed. They then walked 
back up Center Avenue where the Coalition leaders asked them to dis
band with the promise that they would return next Monday if they 
were needed.
If the negotiations had been settled in the same manner Black 
Monday would have been a success. But union negotiators, not used 
to giving in until they have gotten what they want, would not accept 
the proposals offered by the Coalition. Next Monday may again be a 
Black Monday and Next Black Monday may not be so peace
ful.
The trouble is, that no matter how violent or non-violent any 
Black Monday or Tuesday or Friday is the unions will not be for
ced into anything by the Blacks because of the Blacks. The union in 
this country is too strong. It can bearley be handled by the govern
ment itself much less by a small segment or even large minority 
of the country. The Blacks are no longer attacking big business. They 
are no longer just to get an even break from the government, an in
stitution that is to most people impersonal if not almost unreal. Now 
they are after jobs and jobs their after are those of the people who are 
just a little above them in income and class rank. To be sure that 
is how these union people see it. That is why the lower middleclass 
white has feared Black Power all along.
If unions in this area do give in to the Coalition it will not be be
cause of the threat that they themselves represent. The unions may 
give in because racial discrimination is only one, of several faults 
that many people may decide to do something about.
Black Health Program Sought
The Black Students of the 
School of Public Health, the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, and Com
munity Workers are calling upon 
the Black Citizens of this com
munity to help them in awaken
ing the citizens of the various 
Black areas, and Black people 
wherever they may be, to the de
plorable conditions of the general 
health and welfare in their com
munities.
As we all know, effective 
health care requires the services of 
biostatisticians, epidemiologists, 
laboratory personnel, psycholo
gists, tecnhicians, and engineers 
of many types. With increasing 
recognition of the important of 
emotional factors in the etiology 
of general illness, the ideal ex
amination is expected to include
an exploration of psychic and so
cio-economic factors as well as 
physiological.
Therefore, it is generally ap
preciated that good health care 
is a necessity and essential for 
the continuation of Black life on 
this planet. This need is a 
right widely accepted among 
people and recognized in the 
public law. Society, therefore, 
has a commitment to function 
under social policies which are 
not only compatible with this 
right but, even more, which 
contribute to the exercise of this 
right in the pursuit of peace, 
well-being, and happiness.
However, traditionally, Black 
people suffer the most from 
poor health care. Consequently, 
we are the last to receive, if

any  let alone meaningful, aid 
in the area health care. As a re
sult, we are considered a poor 
risk for health insurance and 
when a policy is issued, pay a 
higher premium for this vital 
health protection. When those of 
us are found unaccaptable by a giv
en health insurance company 
come to Hospital for medical 
services, we are either treat
ed inhumanely in the emergency 
room or assigned to teaching 
units. Regardless of socio-econo
mic status, or city area of health 
crisis, invariably, in the case of 
an emergency, police take Blacks 
to Pittsburgh Hospitals. Why? 
It is because they (the police) 
are desirous of Blacks receivong 
the best possible health care?
Due to the lack of verticle 
mobility (prejudice) we, the in
digenous dwellers of the eight 
cultivated colonies of Pittsburgh, 
have over-all a subnormal income. 
Thus, we can ill-afford todays 
advanced and sophisticated health 
care. For example, on Pittsburghs 
North Side, which includes Man
chester and Central North Side, 
thirty per, cent of the thirty thous
and colonized have incomes under 
three thousand dollars per year. 
Where does this colonized indivi
dual turn for health care  Pitts
burgh Hospital, Allegheny Gen
eral, a teaching unit at P.U.H. 
or the inhumane E.R.? Statistics 
for other Black areas of our city 
reflect the same heart-breaking 
figures. This trend is unlikely 
to change if there is a maximum 
of rhetoric and a minimum of 
positive work.
We, the committee of Health and 
the Black Community, with a ma
jor change, choose the latter, i.e., 
a maximum of positive work. We 
realize that while thousands of us 
Black people are living examples
of the above statistics, we, nor the 
general non-Black community, 
are aware of the scope and depth 
of the existing despair-lack of 
health care. We intend to change 
this!
Our first step will be to 
make these Black citizens aware 
of their over-all condition. 
This will be done by a con
centrated campaign of educa
tion and communication. Our 
second phase will be a massive 
does of public relations, utiliz
ing the news media and public 
facilities, guest speakers. We 
will incorporate the participation 
of existing Black organizations to 
facilitate interest and participa
tion of the communities at 
large.
Once the interest is arounsed 
in the communities, we will at
tempt to organize each community 
from the grass-roots in an effort 
to secure adequate and meaning
ful health services for indigent 
Black people.
We feel that theonly way to 
improve community health is 
through active participation by 
those most affected by the insi
dious erosion of health, both men
tal and physical. Our paramount 
concern is good health and fa
cilities for all people, but real
istically, we must start where the 
problem is most acute, The Black 
Community.

denly realized they were treating 
us as equals. Then they became 
the plantation owners and we the 
plantation slaves, Johnson com
mented.
Mayor Barr also appeared at 
the negotiating table to briefly ad
dress the bargainers.
Once again, as mayor if the 
city, I am asking that all rec
ognize the basic human problems 
involved in these negotiations. To 
forget artificial barriers and re
strictions and to open the door of 
this industrynot just for a token 
fewbut with true equality of op
portunity.
When the march ended, Coali
tion leaders said, We are on the
verge of a real breakthrough.
After the leaders ripped the un
ions offer, Nate Smith remark
ed, We had a peaceful demonstra
tion today. We cant guarantee 
what there will be tomorrow.
Monday night ended with both 
sides storming angrily out of the 
bargaining room. Apparently, the 
blacks were angered by the unions 
proposal to change the three-man 
moderating panel which is over
seeing the discussions.
Blacks also charged that the 
unions and contractors wanted to 
cut the present Coalition bargain
ing team from the present 13 
members to four. The unions 
claimed that the internal disagree
ments among the blacks made 
negotiating with the Coalition dif
ficult.
Michael Dismond commented 
Tuesday that if the talks were not 
fruitful, he would call another 
Black Monday next week and con
tinue to do so if the negotiations 
were deadlocked.
He added that he was trying to 
push for a court injunction against 
the continuation of the current 
construction projects in the city.
Wednesday, the talks continued 
in a deadlocked fashion between 
the regular panel of moderators 
and the Federal team headed by 
the Assistant United States Secre
tary of Labor, William Usery.
Although contractors and the 
unions asked for removal of the 
moderators because they were 
not maintaining order in the meet
ing, the panel remained intact.
The roots of racism run deep. 
On the surface it may seem that 
the problem is purely psychologic
al and that therefore the solution 
lies in somehow educating peo
ple to change their attitudes to
wards themselves and others. 
This, at least, is what were 
taught in all so called progressive 
high schools and colleges. If only 
the black person could learn to 
have pride rather than scorn his 
color and his cultural heritage, 
and if only the white person could 
overcome his anti-black prejudices 
then all would be right with this 
country and, hence, with the world 
it dominates.
But the situation is not all that 
simple. For while it is good for the 
black to be proud and absolutely 
imperative for the white to fight 
against his own racist feelings and 
actions, racism will not be ended 
just by eliminating the term nig
ger from our vocabulary or by 
removing the signs for white 
only from lunch counters on uni
versities. Just as a week will 
fourish until destroyed at its roots, 
so racist attitudes and psycholo
gies will poison our society until 
the basis for them is smashed.
We in SDS believe that racism 
has a material basis; thatlike 
all ideas and attitudesit does not 
descend mysteriously out of the 
blue to appear inexplically in our 
minds. Ours is a capitalist socie
ty; capitalism in its highest state, 
imperialism, follows the law of 
maximazation of profits. These 
profits are produced by the vast 
majority of the worlds population 
the working people of all races 
and colorsand are extracted by 
the tiny minority of American 
businessmen, bankers, and bosses 
who rule the world solely for their 
own benefit as a class. We see 
that racism has always been the 
main way that this small class of 
people has made maximum 
amounts of money off the long, 
hard, labor of workers.
Even the U.S. Dept, of Labor 
Statistics will show that black 
workers (and the vast majority of 
black people in America are in the 
working class) average $1,000 
less per man per year for their 
labor than white workers. Mul
tiply that figure by the approxi
mately 22 million Afro-Ameri
can citizens and it comes to 22 
billion dollars. This enormous su
per-profit from the wage differen
tial between black and white work
ers has always been rationalized 
or justified by racism. That is for 
centuries Americans have been 
fed a poisonious diet of racist 
myths that say black people are 
lazy, smell and just are generally 
inferior and so why should they 
make as much money as whites.
In addition, racism allows the rul
ing class to carry out its time 
proven strategy of divide and conqueor. The longer the working 
class allows racism to separate 
it, the longer and more efficient 
is the exploitation that keeps wages 
down and working conditions in
tolerable for all.
The analogy of exploitation as a 
knife in the backs of working peo
ple provides a vivid picture: Ra
cism is used to separate white, 
black, and third world working 
people; the knife of the ruling 
class pierces them; its embed
ded  let us say for the sake of 
analogy  three inches in the 
white, six in the black, and all the 
way in the peasant of Vietnam. If 
this analogy is valid, it is then 
clear that the white worker is 
only relatively better off than the 
rest. But, in fact, all are recipi
ent of the same tool of exploita
tion. It is clearly in the material 
interests of whites to struggle 
with themselves to defeat their 
own racist notions in order to 
unite with their working class 
brothers of all colors for the com
mon fight for the end of mans ex
ploitation of man.
The current struggle of black 
construction workers against the 
racist and corrupt union leader
ship and the building magnets 
here in Pittsburgh provides a 
classic example of what we are 
saying. Blacks need union jobs 
just as much as whites and it is 
not a question of blacks taking 
jobs away from whites, as the 
mayor, press, and union leaders 
would have us believe. They mean 
to whip up racism in order to pre
vent a black and white working 
class alliance that means better 
conditions for the people and less 
profits for themselves.
We in SDS mean to build a mass 
anti-racist, pro-working class 
movement of students on the cam
pus. We mean to demonstrate in 
struggles around the country 
against the universities exploita
tion of thousands of campus work
ers (man of whom are non-white) 
as well as against ROTC, imerialist war research, university 
expansion into working class com
munities, etc., that the American 
universities are owned and oper
ated by trustees who comprise 
the same class of industrialists 
that oppress millions of working 
people here and abroad. We feel 
it is imperative for students to 
build a base on campus that can 
ally with progressive struggles 
of workers. The black construc
tion workers of Pittsburgh are 
currently engaged in such a strug
gle, and C-MU SDS urges students 
to show their support.

five staff writers on the program.
Music Scene is produced by 
Ken Fritz and Stan Harris. Fritz 
formerly was executive producer 
of the Smothers Brothers show 
and personal manager for many 
recording stars. Harris, also direc

cer/director of the highly acclaim
ed Thats Life series.
Producers Ken Fritz and Stan 
Harris like to explain what 
Music Scene is all about with 
an introductory explanation of what 
it is not. It is not a new version 
of Your Hit Parade nor is it a 
variation of American BandBill Johnson is black. He wants 
to go to college next year. Until 
now his chances looked pertty 
slim even though he is consider
ed College material. Bills 
high school cant help him. But 
Upward Bound can.
Each day after morning high 
school classes fifty students like 
Bill come to the Carnegie Campus 
for two hours of instruction in 
English, math, and history. These 
kids are highly motivated and seek 
additional help in their studies. 
For this reason, the Upward 
Bound Tutorial Program has been 
established.
The format of this program 
is as follows: Tutoring will be 
offered in all high school sub
jects each day from 3:30 to 4:30 
in Margaret Morrison. Each tutor 
will be assigned one student and 
will be required to work with 
him for two one-hour sessions 
each week. If these hours are 
not convenient, they can be re
arranged to suit the tutor and tutee. Each week, in addition to the 
two hours, the tutors will attend 
a seminar. At these meetings,

NSA Debt Initiates Policy Review
EL PASSO. Tex - (CPS - 
The aging one-legged veteran 
in the ten-gallon hat sat in his 
wheel chair on the El Paso corn
er between two of the hotels 
serving the 22nd National Student 
Association i NSA) congress.
The ruddy complected man ped
dled American flags. In the early 
days of the two-week long NSA 
meeting the sign strapped to the 
side of his wheel chair read.
 Support our boys  Let's win in 
Vietnam." But when the day pas
sed by. and so did the potential 
1200 student buyers, the flag sales
man changed his pitch. Let's get 
out o Vietnam now.-' appealed a 
new sign on his chair.
Like reaction to the flag sales
mans sincerity, the NSA Con
gress frequently involves ques
tions of sincerity. motiva
tion. and intentions.
For eight days the delegates 
had met. and for eight days not 
one new program or idea had been 
proposed. This in part was due to 
the structure of the congress 
which provided for a week of 
workshops and seminars to be fol
lowed by a week of business-legis
lative and administrative sessions. 
The students, however, began 
blaming themselves and the na
tional staff for a stagnant conven
tion. (The staff already was be
ing blamed for accumulating a 
debt of about $120,000). As one 
delegate put it the second Mon
day. Weve got to get off our 
asses and do something or weve 
just been wasting our time here.
The Chicano (Mexican-American) students charged that a 
primary reason for having the 
congress in El Paso, at the Mex
ican border at Juarez, was to 
make American students aware 
of the plight of the Chicano peo
ple, who make up the majority of 
the population of El Paso. NSA 
was not sincerely attempting to 
do this, the handful of Chicano 
delegates charged. They question
ed whether NSA was interested in 
the Chicano people and pointed 
to member schools in areas where 
Mexicans make up a significant 
portion of the population for not 
sending more Chicano delegates.
NSA passed three resolutions sub
mitted by the Chicano caucus. 
The first sanctioned a student 
boycott of Coors Beer maintain
ing it is discriminatory in its hir
ing practices. The second reaf
firmed NSA's support for the Cal
ifornia table grape boycott.
The third resolution said member 
schools must, in selecting its dele
gates to NSA. represent minority 
groups in porportion to their per
centage on campus. The Chicanos 
had sought a stronger bill which 
would have given representation 
in proportion to the group in the
entire community but an amend
ed version was passed.
Like the Chicanos. many black 
delegates felt stifled by NSAs 
inactivity and bureaucratic procedues particularly during the 
first plenary sessions. Meeting in 
a Third WXORLD Commission 
Caucus, they created the idea for 
a National Association of Black 
Students (NABS) which would 
seek funding from NSA.
The inability of a black stu
dent from Ohio University. Char
les Patton, to obtain the floor 
during Monday nights plenary 
to present the program brought on 
the much publicized black take
over. Out going NSA President 
Robert Powell refused to re
cognize Patton because the es
tablished procedure of the plenary 
was to elect officers at the time. 
Patton claimed the black proposal 
was far more important and the 
black people have been waiting 
for too long, but he didnt press 
the matter until a white student 
was granted the floor to make a 
nomination speech for a ficticious 
candidate.
Patton tried to get the floor 
again, to protest the chair's giv
ing time to the white student 
while refusing himself time to 
present the NABS idea. Failing, 
he walked up to the podium and 
pulled it from the speakers' 
stage.
Other blacks joined him. and 
some removed the stage micro
phones and ripped outthe stage 
phone, bringing proceedings to a 
halt. Black spokesmen called NSA 
and the Congress racist and said 
that the almost 50 blacks present 
were going to discuss racism in 
front of the stage. They suggested 
that the white students break up 
into small gruops and do the same. 
Confused, and in some cases an
gered, the white students took the 
suggestion. Black delegate Muhammed Kenyatta later called 
the groups together and demanded 
that NSA give one-half of all its 
funds to NABS.
The following evening the 
blacks, led by former NSA staff 
member Gwen Patton, modiefied 
the demand to $50,000 payable to 
NABS by the end of October. 
The delegates passed the black 
proposal overwhelmingly.
A question remains, however, 
as to whether the blacks will see 
the cash by the end of October. 
I think I can raise the money 
by then. NSA President-elect 
Charles Palmer told CPS. But 
I look at the approval of the $50 
thousand as more of a com
mitment to pay the money than a 
timetable for payment.
Black students later maintained 
that although they understand 
NSAs financial difficulties, the
timetable is important and is ex
pected to be honored.
As proposed by Miss Patton 
NABS will use its money to pro
vide scholarships, communica
tions and organization among 
member schools. Independent 
groups as well as black student 
unions may join NABS. Some 
delegates maintained that since 
NSA has failed in its organiza
tional tasks. NABS might be able 
to provide that service for at least 
one group of students.
This year NSA almost failed to 
elect the one officer whose 
principal duty is such coordina
tion and organization on and 
among campuses. And the even
tual winner of the position. 
Clinton Devaux. a black from State 
University of New York at Buf
falo. opposed the NABS program, 
opposes black separatism and op
poses consideration of violence 
as a means toward student goals 
in any situation. He is a close 
associate of U. S. Rep. Allard 
Lowenstein (D-NY).
Devaux was elected by only 
two votes after an earlier elec
tion was nullified by the dele
gates. Several of the delegates 
had alleged that staff members 
and National Supervisory Board 
members had influenced dele
gates against one candidate dur
ing the voting. Both of the run
off candidates walked out of the 
congress in disgust at separate 
points during the election.
The depressed delegates voted, 
at out going President Powells 
suggestion, to elect no campus af
fairs vice president since no can
didates remained and Powell in
sinuated the position was not very 
important.
The delegates later reversed 
themselves, heard speeches from 
five candidates. and were 
about to begin voting, when De
vaux finally decided to have his 
name placed in nomination. De
vaux and six other candidates had 
been beaten badly in the presi
dential race on the first ballot by 
Charles Palmer, former student 
body president and "Peoples 
Park leader at the University of 
California, Berkeley. Palmer belives militant tactics and vio
lence sometimes may be legi
timate in winning the goals of 
students and that student organ
ization must develop primarily on 
the local level.
Devaux was allowed to have 
his name put in nomination  al
though nominations had been clos
ed. He gave his second emotionpacked speech of the congress  
his first came after losing to Pal
mer and squeezed out a two-vote 
victory. His win prompted the 
Iowa-Nebraska delegation to 
walk out of the congress and promp
ted Palmer to give a speech of 
non confidence.
Palmer had been considrered a 
healer who could pick up NSA's 
weakening spirit. He was liked 
by almost everyone, including 
black delegates; he promoted an 
image of a president of all the 
students; and he seemed concern
ed with pushing the campus or
ganizing many delegates were 
seeking. His election was a shot in 
the arm to NSA.
Devauxs election was a bring
down to many of the delegates 
who distrusted his ties to Lowen
stein. Lowenstein they said, was 
trying to gain an inroad into stu
dent politics so as to keep it 
from becoming too militant. And 
Devauxs election was a bring down 
to those who felt his personal views 
were too moderate to be much of 
an organizer among campuses.
Palmer, who had stayed out of 
the campus affairs race after as
suming part of the blame for the 
afternoons confusion, told the 
delegates after Devauxs elec
tion:
Im going to accept the will 
of this body, but I'm also going 
to see that those elected accept 
thepolicies laid down by 
this body. If Clinton can do this, 
than I guess hes vice president.
Before the final day of plenary 
business meetings, everyone had 
remarked how well NSA was com
ing out of its congress. Some main
tained the congress failed in one 
respect. It had not looked at 
problems as economic in nature. 
It did not consider racism or pov
erty. for example, in the con
text of theproblems of a capital
ist society.
But even those who felt the 
congress failed in this aspect felt 
the meeting had been a positive 
step for NSA. Everybody liked 
Charles Palmer, and the delegates 
consciences had been salved by 
commiting $50,000 to the black 
students.
But the conflict and distrust 
during the final day put the or
ganization black on the seriously 
sick list again. NSA now has some 
internal bleeding to stop.
1)If NSA is going to be able to 
solve its severe financial diffi
culties. The delegates did elect 
a business oriented man, Jim 
Sutton from the University of 
Iowa, as its executive vice presi
dent. Sutton seems uninvolved in 
the Palmer-Devaux clash, but a 
$120,000 debt needs a combined 
staff effort. And some of Sut
tons ideas  such as proposals 
for cooperative NSA grocery 
stores and gasoline sta
tions  sound a bit extravagant 
for a group that has no money 
to invest and bills to pay, includ
ing $50,000 to NABS by Octo
ber 31. Staff members said they 
should be able to meet their 
debys through their travel and 
record clubs and similar service 
promotions.
2) If NSA is going to be able 
to serve its members well enough 
to keep them from disaffiliat
ing. As one student body presi
dent, who will urge disaffilia
tion on her campus, said, We 
can get record clubs elsewhere. 
Thats Not what NSA should 
be.
The Eternal Tramp
Charlie Chaplin The Et
ernal Tramp will be seen on 
WQED Tuesday, September
30 at 7:30 and repeated Satur
day, October 4 at 7:30. Harvy
Hurwitz, a free lance film
maker and producer, wrote, direc
ted, edited, and produced The 
Eternal Tramp. The film,
made in 1967, was Mr. Hurwitzs first documentary and 
has never been seen on television 
before.
Mr. Hurwitz described the 
purpose of the film as not only 
a biographical study of Chaplin 
the man, but also and more cen
trally as an in-depth analysis 
of Chaplains folk hero, The Lit
tle Tramp, as a fictional chara
cter.
Gloria Swanson was chosen to 
narrate the film because of her 
own reputation as queen of the 
silent film era, and also because 
she worked as an extra in some of 
Chaplins early films and is also 
a close personal friend.
The documentary contains lib
eral film clips from early Chap
lin movies some of which have
never been seen on television. 
There is also newsreel footage 
of Chaplin.
Mr. Hurwitz is currently finish
ing production on his first feature 
film, which will be released in 
September. It is titled The 
Projectionist and Stars Chuck 
McCann, Rodney Dangerfield, 
and Ina Balin.
Meta-Curricular Activities 
Includes Lectures, Films
When the plans for the New College Curricula were set down 
last year, one portion was set aside for meta-curricular activities. The 
meta-curriculum would encompass all activities pertinent to the col
lege experience that were outside the academic realm. In the re
port on the New College. Building from Strentgh, A New College 
For Carnegie-Mellon University, the committee stated its concept of 
the meta-curriculum.
We intend to use some of the students time outside the class and 
classwork for additional experience in learning to be at home in the 
world .... we mean the campus to be the center of the world for our 
students  the point from which they venture out frequently, but al
ways point to which they return to sort out and work over their exper
iences among themselves and with the faculty ... If they leave after 
four years unable to live richly and understandingly in a city, we have 
failed.
This year the set-up for the meta-curriculum is basically parasitic. 
They are drawing on the Activities Board s plans for the year and us
ing their speakers and events as a basis for the program. Whenever 
a speaker is brought in, an attempt is made to set up a time when he 
will meet with the new college people and talk with them. For in
stance, Sander Vanocur will speak to the New College after he has ap
peared before the University. The idea is for the students to see these 
people as men, and to begin to see why and how they have become 
what they are. It is them as individuals, not as vice-presidents or news
casters. that will be stressed
Beyond lectures, there are plans for films and trips to museums 
< with interesting tours) that will be grounds for discussions in class.
There is a committee that is constantly reviewing the program; 
Professor Schoenwald of the Department of History is Chairman 
and Bob McCurdy is Vice-Chairman. Several students and other faculty 
members sit on the committee. Their intent this year is to gain offi
cial recognition from the academic side of the fact that this meta-curriculum has an important place in the New College program. It is still 
unclear if the academic factors will give ground if a conflict between 
the two arises (Most students attend classes if the only time they can 
speak to a visotir is at the same time?)

The CMU soccer team opens its second varsity season tomorrow at St. Francis. Coach 
March Krotee has replaced Joseph Kruth, who last year coached the Tartans to an impressive 
5-3 record. This years team has a lot more material with which to work but also faces a much 
tougher schedule.
Graduating from last years squad are the two co-captains, Luis Rosanes and Sam Weiner, 
but coach Krotee has ten returning lettermen and a lot of good newcomers on his 33 man squad. 
After two and a half weeks of prac
tice, Krotee is still not decided 
on his starting team. In fact, he 
knows only two members who are 
assured of starting berths  co
captains Henrik Palme and 
Jim Eisenman.
Palmer was the teams second 
leading scorer last season with 
six goals from his center half
back position. Eisenman, a sen
ior, was a standout at center 
fullback. However, he suffered 
a broken nose in Tuesdays prac
tice and may be out for as long as 
two weeks.
Other returning lettermen are 
senior Ron Letzler, juniors Chris 
Escott, Dave Vinish, Bader Wahedi, Marcel Weiner, and Mike 
Sugarman, and Sophomores Jac
ques Borisewitz and Ken Kern.

ACTION AT CMU soccier team scrimmage. The Tartans open the 
season tomorrow at St. Francis in an effort to improve on last years
53 record.
The size of the squad is en
couraging  33 members this year 
compared to 22 last year. Coach 
Krotee is somewhat concerned with 
the teams conditioning and will 
probably substitute frequently, 
particularly in the first few 
games.
Another encouraging face is 
that the team has been granted 
permission to play all home games 
on the football field. The stands 
are mush more conducive for 
spectators, and the surface of the 
field is a vas improvement over 
the etmporary field set up on the 
I.M. field last year.
The soccer team is only in its 
second year and was given var
sity status after the successful 
formation of the soccer club in 
the spring of 1968. Rosanes and 
Sam Weiner were instrumental in 
the establishment of the team, 
and many of the returning play
ers form lastyear were members of
