Tartan Needs Manpower
The Tartan is a potentially pow
erful instrument. It reports, com
ments and creates issues. In or
der to properly carry on its enor
mous task, the campus newspa
per needs manpower. If you are 
interested in any phase of news
paper work, come to a meeting 
this Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in the 
Tartan office, Room 50, Skibo.
The Tartan publishes twice 
weekly, Tuesday and Friday. The 
new deadlines are Tuesday night 
for Fridays issue and Saturday 
night for Tuesdays publication. 
Any organization or individual 
submitting copy must have it in 
the Tartan office by those times 
if it is to be published.
Many departments of the news
paper need a larger staff. The 
News Department needs report
ers to cover all timely issues on 
campus. Film and book reviews, 
opinion columns, poetry, inter
views and other untimely copy is 
written by our feature writers. 
Our sports staff, of course, re
ports on varsity and intramural 
sports.
The Production Department 
also needs helpediting and re
writing copy, writing headlines, 
and layout. If you would like to 
work in this area but have no ex
perience, we can teach you.
The business end of the paper 
is in charge of making money by 
national and local advertising. 
This year we are operating on a 
$16,000 per year budget. Help us 
spend our money wisely.
Or you may be interested in typ
ing, taking photographs, manag
ing the office or sending out bills. 
We need you for these jobs alos.
Help make the Tartan a mean
ingful publication. Get involved. 
Meet exciting people. Be concern
ed. Granted, it is a lot of hard 
workoften tiring, often frustrat
ing. But when you see the positive 
results of your efforts, it all be
comes worthwhile. The Tartan 
can make your ollege experi
ence even more meaningful. Why 
not give it a try?

Students Organize 
Against Psych. Dept
Editor. The Tartan:
There has been a growing prob
lem concerning the admissions 
policies of the Psychology Depart
ment for the last two years. That 
department has refused to accept 
the overwhelming majority of the 
many Carnegie-Mellon students 
desiring to transfer.
A year ago there were 200 
such students. Since then the de
partment has expanded only 
enough to accommodate the in
coming freshmen. Last week Dr.
E. R. Steinberg, dean of H. and S. 
S.. said that no plans have been 
made to open the department with
in the next few years.
We can recall no other policy 
with which Carnegie-Mellon has 
denied students their right to an 
open education. Students needs 
and demands when concisely ex
pressed have been quickly fulfill
ed. The recent demands for drug 
education and fraternity housing 
are primary examples. There is 
no precedent for the Psychology 
Department's repressive policy.
We do have hope. There is 
strong pressure within the psy
chology faculty to open the de
partment. A number of sympathe
tic faculty members have gained 
positions of power within the last 
year. Two of these. Dr. James 
Korn and Dr. Victor Vroom. were 
recently elected to the steering 
committee, the central power 
structure in the department. In 
addition, the entire undergrad
uate program in psychology will 
be revamped this year at a series 
of faculty meetings. Our sympa
thizers will represent us.
John Parkman, an instructor in 
the department, has said that the 
issue of an open department will 
be fiercely debated at these meet
ings, and that pressure from the 
students might well swing the bal
ance in favor of an open depart
ment.
The first faculty meeting will 
be on Wednesday, Sept. 17. If we 
are to have an open department, 
we must apply some pressure be
fore and during that meeting. To
ward this end we will meet and 
organize next Monday. Sept. 15, in 
Room 46, Skibo, 7 p.m. All sympa
thizers are welcome. This is your 
school, your education. Care about 
it.

SUNDAY, SEPT 14th
2:30 p.m.
TARTAN OFFICE 
Room 50 Skibo
The Academic Affairs Board, 
chaired by Michael Armentrout, 
has already begun operations. In 
an open letter to the student body 
(Tartan, September 5) Michael 
mentioned several suggestions 
concerning how such a board 
could operate effectively.
At a meeting with Dr. Edward 
Schatz, vice-president for Aca-, 
demic Affairs, these and other 
proposals were discussed. The 
following information is contain
ed in a memo sent by Dr. Schatz 
to the deans of the Colleges.
1. An External Evaluation 
of the Academic Programs:
Armentrout suggests this in the 
latter portion of the Tartan arti
cle. I referred to various outside 
studies already made by accredit
ing agencies, visiting committees, 
etc. Whether or not another out
side study should be made, it is 
clear that we have not communi
cated very well with the student 
body the results of existing 
studies.
We agreed to continue discus
sions of this item. I will be send
ing to you shortly a report I have 
prepared on the operations of the 
visiting committees during the 
past year. Perhaps some thought 
should be given to adding stu
dents to visiting committees and 
to broadcasting more widely the 
functions of the committees and 
the results of their deliberations.
2. The Departmental 
Advisory Committees
There is some concern about 
the success of these committees 
and others to advise the Faculty 
Senators. The worry is that de
partments can ignore or bury sug
gestions, that the process is slow 
both in the feedback sense and in 
the action sense. That is, formal, 
even frequent, meetings may not 
be the right feedback path, and 
the actions of departments and 
the Senate may be too slow to cor
rect fast-moving situations.
I continue to believe that these 
student advisory committees are 
very important and every effort 
should be made to make them 
work, especially at jobs they can 
do well. I hope that you will con
tinue discussions with depart
ment heads and try to arrive at a 
workable scheme for student ad
visory committees.
3. Departmental Ombudsman"
One of the ways discussed to 
get around the feedback-action 
problem above is to appoint and to 
publicize the appointment of a de
partmental ombudsman. Such a 
person might be the department 
head, or a member of the faculty 
designated for this purpose. The 
function of the ombudsman would 
be to listen to problems and com
plaints from a student or group of 
students and then take immediate 
action (24 hours or less) if pos
sible. Such a procedure would be 
able to handle such cases as: (a) 
lecturers going too fast or giving 
unclear lectures; (b) unexplain
ed absences of teachers from 
classrooms; (c) lack of sufficient 
examinations; (d> possible poor
grading practices. Other prob
lems might require a longer time 
for action, but even in this case 
the problem would be identified 
early. The ombudsman should not 
reveal the identity of students 
coming to see him unless it is ab
solutely necessary. It seems to 
me that this idea has several mer
its: It could get problems handled 
quickly and within departments. 
Would you look into it, please?
In writing this, another though 
occurred to me. Why not have 
some student ombudsmen? This 
might work best in large classes 
where the lecturer might appoint 
a rotating student committee 
which would meet with him on a 
weekly basis to assess all aspects 
of the progress of the class. I be
lieve this has been tried. Are we 
using the system anywhere?
I would appreciate it if you 
would give some thought to these 
problems and discuss them with 
department heads.
Tour Guides are needed to help 
prospective students to get 
acquainted with the C-MU cam
pus.

KQV Probes Drug Generation
Three Hour Special September 15
The drug abuse problem in Pitts
burgh is of major concern to both 
health and police officials as well 
as scores of parents.
KQV Radio, realizing that the 
drug problem was neither minor 
nor confined to ghetto areas, will 
broadcast an in-depth study of this 
problem entitled The Drugged 
Generation, Monday, Sept. 15, 
7 tp.m.
The growing number of young 
people who were becoming involv
ed with drugs as users and in 
some cases addicts was revealed 
through the staggering number of 
narcotic cases passing through juvenilscourt and the increasing 
number of deaths resulting from 
drugs. These young people were 
from all socio-economic back
grounds and some were alarming
ly young.
KQV sought the assistance of 
mental health agencies, the state 
health department, the courts, 
churches, universities, and the 
users themselves in uncovering 
the problems which seemed to be 
the basis for the use of drugs by 
our youth.
ROTC News
Second Lieutenant Eli A. Homza, Jr., a 1969 graduate of the CMU Music Department was re
cently designated Distinguished 
Honor Graduate of his Basic In
fantry Officers Leadership Class 
at the United States Army Infan
try School, Fort Benning, Ga. Lt. 
Homza finished first in a class 
of 192 officers, 185 of whom 
ere Distinguished Military 
Graduates of colleges and univer
sity ROTC programs throughout 
the country. His examination av
erage was 97 per cent.
As a student at C-MU, Lt. Hom
za was very active in the ROTC 
program as well as in his academ
ic field. For four successive years 
he was awarded the Department 
of Armys Superior Cadet Award. 
During his senior year, he was 
commander of the Cadet Brigade 
and an officer in the CounterGuerrilla Training Unit. Upon 
graduation, he was designated a 
Distinguished Military Graduate 
and received a commission as an 
infantry second lieutenant in the 
regular army of the United States.
Lt. Homza started paratrooper 
training at the Infantry School on 
Aug. 22. Following Airborne 
School he will attend Ranger 
School and subsequently be assign
ed to the Armys famed 82nd 
Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, 
N.C.
Cadet Charles J. Dierker, a sen
ior in the Civil Engineering De
partment, has been named the 
C-MU ROTC Cadet Battalion 
Commander for the 1969-70 school 
year. The recipient of an Army 
ROTC Scholarship, Cadet Dierker

A three-hour documentary was 
conceived which reveals the story 
from both sides. The Drugged 
Generation is an in-depth study 
that outlines the history of drugs, 
their use and abuse. It will fea
ture actual interviews with peo
ple who use drugs, both on an oc
casional basis and on those who 
have become addicted.
The legal issues in the narcotics 
situation will also be examined. 
Judge Richard Wentley of the Juvenile Court of Allegheny County 
will discuss court procedures in 
dealing with juvenile offenders. 
Another participant will be public 
defender Richard Joseph and city 
police officials will tell their side.
Yhe entire three-hour documen
tation will be laced with music of 
the generation that is often close
ly identified with drugs. The 
Drugged Generation is a presen
tation of KQVs public affairs de

September marks the beginning 
of the second season of Special 
Teaching Projects, STP, in the 
Pittsburgh school district. This 
program was first developed to 
stimulate the interest and curiosi
ty of junior high school students 
in science through classroom 
demonstrations and to give C-MU 
students classroom teaching ex
perience.
The rationale behind the pro
ject is that junior high school stu
dents may still be open to being 
motivated to pursue wider inter
ests and perhaps raise their edu
cational goals.
The main tool for accomplish
ing this project is the use of class
room science demonstrations. 
Last year, STP used equipment 
such as lasers, liquid nitrogen, 
stroboscopes, and the dissection 
of frogs for demonstrations. The 
content of each demonstration 
was left to the discretion of the 
student presenting it, with appro
priate approval from the instruc
tor of the class.
Any C-MU sophomore, junior, 
senior or graduate student in en
gineering and science may volun
teer for this project. An orienta
tion session for all volunteers 
will be held in September to give 
background on STP.
Interested students may sign up 
now for STP in the C-MU YMYWCA office, Room 57. Skibo.
Thursday Forum:
The Drafta Personal and So
cial Hangup will be discussed by 
Tom Kerr, leading civil liberties 
attorney and instructor in GSIA, 
and the Rev. Ralph Hagopian, 
draft counselor and chaplain with 
University and City Ministries, at 
the Y
s Thursday Noon Forum on 
Thursday, Sept. 18.
Mr. Kerr is the author of an ar
ticle which appeared in the Tartan 
last April 30 questioning the con
stitutionality of the current selec
tive service law. Mr. Hapopian 
founded and directs the Draft 
Counseling Center at the UACM, 
the ecumenical Protestant agen
cy serving universities in Pitts
burgh. Both men will speak out of 
experiences counseling many in
dividuals, particularly about the 
harm the draft system does to 
young men and out society today.
The Forum begins at 12:30 
p.m. in the Wherrett Room. Any
one may come and bring his lunch.
Industrial Rountable
The Industrial Roundtable, a 
program sponsored by the YMYWCA for seniors in E&S and 
AMS, will begin on Wednesday, 
Sept. 17. at 5:30 p.m. in the fac
ulty dining room. The series of six 
dinner meetings will feature dis
cussions of career problems

The first meeting will deal with 
the job interview, the expecta
tions of companies, and the best 
response for students to make. 
The staff of the Placement Office.
The programs are planned so 
that the participants can talk with 
people with varied experiences in 
industry in informal settings and 
in small groups. At subsequent 
meetings a number of C-MU alum
ni will be present for discussions.
The Roundtable is still open to 
any E&S or AMS senior. Registra
tion is at the Y office, 57 Skibo. 
Cost is $15 for the six meals and

} THE NATURE OF |
I CRITICISM I
E by Robert Rastelli s
illlllllllllllllilllilllllllllllillltllllllllllHlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllUlllllllllllillllliiililliii
The university student reads. He cannotescape that act. He must 
read in order to maintain a successful balance between his awareness 
of his field and his awareness of the world. If he stops reading, he 
stops being a student and soon fails as a functioning, contributing, so
cial animal.
In some respects, each of us is a critic, at least a fringe-critic. We 
read an anthology, a novel, a collection, or a treatise, and we invari
ably comment as to our approval or our disapproval. Peripheral critics 
are easy to find. They are all around us (if we are not one ourselves, 
which is rare. The problem remains that most of us take as truth the 
word of the peripheral critic. This is our fault.
The nature of criticism demands that the peripheral critic be eli
minated if the word of any critic is to be taken as truth. There is a very 
thin line between validity and critical incompetence, and the general 
reading public very simply does not know where that line is.
Who can explain to the general public exactly where that line ex
ists? What, if anything, makes a critic a valid one whose assumptions 
and conclusions are honorable and noteworth? What is it that qualifies 
the critic as valid?
The qualification comes from precision. If the critic reads a poem 
and approves of it, he must be able to substantiate his claims of praise 
with details. If he maintains that the poem is well-constructed, he must 
be precise enough to know why it is well-constructed and what makes 
its structure better than that of a different piece. Likewise, if his claim 
is that the work is badly constructed, the critic must point out specific 
ills in the piece which evidence its poor construction. He must point 
them out and explain why they are wrong.
But then again, where does the critic obtain his ability to judge f 
whether something is bad or something is good? How does he have 
the right to not only explain that a literary work is poor, but also to 
make its flaws public?
The judgment of the critic can only come through intense study. If 
he is going to review poetical works, then it is essential that he have 
studied all types of poetry from all eras and genres and for a lengthy 
time. Fortunately or unfortunately, societies are based on tradition and 
the continuation of a cultural standard. This standard evidences itself 
in literature, and what is considered good and a literary triumph 
of one age is most likely to be used as the model for those pieces writ
ten at any time thereafter. Hence, even if the mechanics of composi
tion and structure change, and even is the subject matter of a specific 
work does not apply to contemporary thought, the work in its excellence 
will nonetheless remain the model by which all other works are to be 
judged.
So the critic studies poetry (or films, or novels, etc.) for a period 
of many years, and he qualifies as a true critic, based also on his honesty 
and general degree of literary competence. This is not all he does.
The critic cannot get away with a passing judgment or comment.
If he maintains any sort of opinion at all, then he must sincerely con
tribute to the possible betterment of the work which he criticizes. It 
becomes terribly easy for the critic to say bad or good, but it is 
not so easy to say, this is how to fix it. A critic very simply is not val
id unless he legitimately contributes to the betterment of that area 
which he reviews.
Is the literary critic necessary? Yes. He has a great responsibility 
to the unknowing public as well as to the published few. He aids in the 
improvement (if needed) of the literary world and he publicly gives 
praise to those who deserve it. The critic is with us and, for the mo
ment, happily so.
Institute to Educate
Minority Businessmen
A new effort to help develop 
black capitalism and other minor
ity group business enterprises in 
the nations inner cities was an
nounced Sept. 3 by the U.S. Of
fice of Education.
The Offices Bureau of Resesearch said it was awarding $200,-
000 to Howard Universitys Small 
Business Guidance and Develop
ment Center for a 15-month pro
ject to design and establish an In
stitute for Minority Business Ed
ucation.
The Institute is expected to be a 
model program for universities 
and other educational institutions 
that want to improve the ability of 
minority businessmen to operate 
profitable enterprises.
Researchers at the Institute 
will pinpoint successful manage
ment and business techniques and 
devise ways of adapting them to 
the special needs of minority busi
nessmen.
One technique the researchers 
will explore is the franchise sys
tem involving such businesses as 
auto dealerships, restaurants and 
food shopts. and service stations.
The Institute will also be a 
clearing house for information on 
planning and operating minority 
business ventures. It will publish 
a how-to-do-it manual and upto-date listings of available fran
chise opportunities.
Another dissemination activity 
will involve the use of trade asso

ADMISSION - 50 CENTS
A Letter to Freshmen
As academic pressures increase and a new environment raises a 
multitude of new problems, no matter how well one adapts he feels a 
need for something better and bigger than himself. He feels a need for 
relationships which at times reinforce and sometimes questions his 
philosophies. He feels a need to continually improve his growing pro
cess and to make the most of his college experience. For a large per
centage of college men fraternities are the answer.
You, as freshmen, will see parts of the broad fraternity concept 
here at Carnegie. You will see Brothers on the IM field playing their 
hearts out for themselves and for their House, sending a pinned Broth
er to a watery reward, and engaged in, if not running, all types of cam
pus activities. You will not see an even bigger partthat of fraternity 
men making known their thoughts at meetings, dinners and bull ses
sions, helping one another with academic problems and partying as few 
people can on weekends. And the greatest part of fraternity life you 
not see, since nobody can see a feeling. It is the feeling of mutual trust, 
respect and friendship that is the raison detre of fraternal life.
Our progressivsfraternity system has a lot to offer a college man. 
Look at us with an open mind; find out why we are so proud to be 
Greeks. The opportunity lies with you to join us.
Sincerely,
David Ringler 
President, Council 
of Fraternity Presidents

Rhodes Scholarships
INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES 
19 6 9
Elections to Rhodes Scholarships will be held in all states in December, 1969. Scholars-elect 
will enter Oxford University in October, 1970. If a Scholar-elect is called into military service before 
entering Oxford, the Rhodes Trustees will permit him to postpone his Scholarship and take it up at 
the conclusion of his service if the University and his College can accommodate him at that time.
To BE ELIGIBLE A CANDIDATE MUST:
1. Be a male citizen of the United States, with at least five years' domicile, and unmarried. 
A Rhodes Scholarship is forfeited by marriage after election, or during a scholars first year 
of residence. Subject to certain conditions the Rhodes Trustees may continue the payment 
of the Scholarship if a Scholar marries after his first year at Oxford.
2. Be between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four on October 1, 1969.
3. By the time of application have at least Junior Standing at some recognized degree-grant
ing college or university.
4. Receive official endorsement of his college or university.
The qualities which Cecil Rhodes specified in his will as forming the basis of selection are: (1) 
literary and scholastic ability and attainments; (2) qualities of manhood, truthfulness, courage, de
votion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness, and fellowship; 
(3) exhibition of moral force of character, and of instincts to lead and to take an interest in his fel
lows; (4) physical vigor, as shown by fondness for and success in sports. Quality of both character 
and intellect is the most important requirement for a Rhodes Scholarship, and this is what the com
mittees will seek.
The stipend of a Rhodes Scholarship consists of a direct payment to the Scholars College of 
approved fees (such as matriculation, tuition, laboratory fees, and certain other set charges), plus a 
maintenance of 840 per year, which is paid directly to the Scholar. These combined payments now 
exceed 1120 a year. Appointment to a Rhodes Scholarship is made for two years in the first instance 
with a possible third year if the Scholars record at Oxford and plan of study warrant such an award. 
Subject to the consent of his College a Scholar may read for the Oxford B.A. in any of the Final 
Honour Schools or, with the consent of his College and the relevant Faculty, he may be admitted, if 
qualified by previous training, to read for a higher degree such as the B.Sc., B.Litt., B.C.L., B.Phil. or D.PhiL
Candidates apply in one of the fifty states: either in the state in which they have their ordi
nary private domicile, home, or residence, or in a state in which they may have received at least two 
years of college training. Applications must be in the hands of the secretary of the state committee not 
later than October 31, 1969. The names and addresses of secretaries of state committees of selection 
are printed in the Memorandum of Regulations.
The Institutional Representative in this institution from whom copies of the Memorandum of 
Regulations (which includes an application blank) and other information may be obtained is
2>.Ob<N.................................................
Candidates who for any reason have difficulty in obtaining application blanks or other needed 
information should write to The Rhodes Scholarship Office, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa. 19081.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 12th
The Birth Control Committee, 
formed last year, has already 
held one meeting this year. The 
group has decided to investigate 
college health services and clin
ics in Pittsburgh and to establish 
an educational program. The pro
gram will consist of a handbook of 
information on birth control and 
abortion, an information table, 
speakers, films, and perhaps dis
cussion groups.
The group needs people who are 
willing to help. Especially needed
are those with editorial ability to 
help with the handbook, people to 
help organize speakers and films, 
and people who can aid in distri
buting the handbook in area col
leges and high schools. Those in
terested should contact Pat Cava
naugh, Tom Burgess, or Steve 
Rosenburg at 521-9178.
The group feels that a problem 
already exists. Statistics on ille
gitimate births and eaths from 
inept or self administered abor
tions show that. The group thinks
that the best reaction is to make 
information available, to pro
mote mature thought about the 
problem, and to provide people 
with a choice.
The committee plans to make 
the project city wide by associat
ing with like interested groups on 
other local colleges.
As ignorance and fear cannot 
solve the problem, the group 
hopes to be useful to as many 
Pittsburgh students as possible.
