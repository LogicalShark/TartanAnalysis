Explorers Club 
Announces 1960 
Climbing School
Saturday, March 12 is the date 
for the first session of the annual 
Explorers Club Climbing School.
Designed especially for begin
ners, the Climbing School teaches 
basic techniques needed for safe 
rock climbing, mountaineering, 
and cave exploring.
Among the items included in 
the school are basic climbing 
techniques, the use of a rope to 
protect climbers from a fall (be
laying), use of a rope in descend
ing a vertical rock face or hole 
(rappelling), ladder climbing, and 
techniques for climbing a rope 
safely (prussik climbing).
^SaonfSr ;nei
This Saturdays session will 
take place at High Rocks (a 
climbing area near Blairsville, 
about 45 miles east of Pittsburgh. 
Those interested will meet in 
front of Engineering Hall at 12:00 
noon on Saturday. The trip will 
take most of Saturday afternoon, 
but climbers will be back in 
plenty of time for Saturday night 
festivities.
In case of bad weather, the 
group will still meet as scheduled, 
and will use convenient areas on 
campus for belay and rappel prac
tice. 
Members of the Explorers Club 
emphasize that beginners are al
ways welcome in the clubs activi
ties, and that the Climbing School 
is a particularly good way to get 
started.
Scotch n Soda Makes 
1960 Cast Selections
Ed Frederickson, the director of Scotch and Sodas 1960 
show, On the Rocks, is extremely enthusiastic about the 
new show.
He and the board of directors of Scotch and Soda feel 
that this years production will*--------:-------------
definitely be blue chip. There 
can be little doubt that this pre
diction will come true when one

^aoftya cAyqntmm Tekk ptta

looks at the talent and dramatic 
experience exhibited in the shows 
participants.
The director himself has four 
years experience with Scotch and 
Soda. Ed has had leading roles in 
the last two shows, is familiar 
with dancing, acting, and singing, 
and is well familiar with the fine 
points of good performance.
Eds leadership is sure to pro
duce a fine performance, espe
cially in light of the cast of per
formers chosen for On the 
Rocks. Although not complete 
due to the necessity of clearing 
people from the drama depart
ment for participation in the 
show, a look at this years cast
will explain why it has been 
called the most talented group of 
performers ever grouped for one 
years Scotch and Soda. Those 
chosen to perform, in various and 
different capacities are: Barbara 
Gruger, Pat Miller, Charlotte 
Rogers, Verna Robinson, Elizabeth 
Kim, Wendy Steinberg, Millicent 
Goldstick, Gigi Franklin, Dianne 
Thomas, Dick Desbery, Nate Leblang, Frank Leone, Pat Sands, 
Ron Satlof, Sam Vail, Judi Dippel, 
Sheldon Kaplan and Bev Patton.
Rehearsals for On the Rocks'* 
have begun and enthusiasm is Sa 
a very high pitch. The show 
promises to really be one of the 
best productions of Scotch Syf 
Soda ever.

BRIDGING THE GAP
...from components, equipments, and subsystems 
to fully integrated, large-scale systems
Air defense missiles, unmanned interceptors, manned 
interceptors, early warning aircraft, long-range radar, gap 
filler radar, Texas towers, vast communication nets, high
speed computers and advanced information display 
devices are a few of the integral parts in an air defense 
system. Each of these has its individual operational char
acteristics and it is the responsibility of The MITRE 
Corporation to provide the basic system engineering and 
design necessary to integrate these many diverse and 
complex parts into a mutually compatible, fullyintegrated air defense system.
Formed under sponsorship of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, MITRE employs the skills of 
engineers, mathematicians, physicists and psychologists 
on large-scale system projects ranging from design 
through prototype engineering and subsystem develop
ment to test and evaluation of the total on-line system.
The growing scope of MITRE's technological effort 
affords the opportunity to establish a rewarding 
professional career in one of these areas of long-term 
importance:
