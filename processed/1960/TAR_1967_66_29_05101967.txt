Chorus Presents Works EDIT0RIAI-o Visiting Professors
A special concert will be 
presented to the student body 
and faculty at the assembly 
on Tuesday, May 16, at 11:30 
am in the Skibo ballroom. The 
Carnegie Chorus will sing 
large-scale choral pieces by 
two distinguished composers 
who have been teaching in the 
Music Department at Tech 
this past year as visiting pro
fessors: Virgil Thomson and 
Carlos Surinach.
The first work to be perform
ed will be Virgil Thomsons set
ting of Seven Choruses from the 
Medea of Euripides in an Eng
lish translation by Countee Cul
len. This is for women's voices 
and percussion instruments.
The second work is the Can
tata of Saint John by Carlos Sur
inach, for mixed voices and per
cussion instruments. This was 
commissioned by CBS-TV in 
1962; according to the composer,
it was written in homage to the 
island of Puerto Rico, and is 
dedicated to the city of San 
Juan. The composer wrote it 
simultaneously in Spanish and 
English; at Tuesdays perform
ance the chorus will sing it in 
English.
The Carnegie Chorus recent
ly taped both of these works for 
National Educational Television, 
and if plans work out, the tape 
will be shown in all cities which 
have an NET outlet. The chorus 
will also present these works at 
the annual benefit concert of 
the Musicians Club of Pitts
burgh.
The Carnegie Chorus of 60 
voices and the entire percus
sion ensemble, will be directed 
by Professor Donald Wilkins. 
The entire student body, and 
the faculty, are cordially in
vited to attend this assembly 
concert.
Snoopy, Barbarian 
Capture Honors
The winners of the fraternity 
booth competition were an
nounced on Saturday night at 
the Spring Carnival dance. The 
booths on the midway were 
judged by members of the Fine 
Arts faculty for appropriate
ness to theme, type of game, me
chanics, construction and visual 
effect.
The first-prize winner was 
Sigma Nus Snoopy and the 
Red Barbarian in which the 
contestants aimed a Snoopy 
to shoot a swinging Red Bar
on down over a smoke-belch
ing volcano. The mechanics 
included the hills of Rome 
shaking during the volcano 
eruptions.
The Born Loser of Sigma Al
pha Epsilon, the second-place 
winner, included a game of ball 
rolling and balancing down a 
series of planks.
The third-place award went to 
Beta Theta Pi for its traditional 
Dunk a Beta, interpreted this 
year by a Popeye theme. A rock 
landing on the boat forced the 
Beta to jump into a lake.
The midway included booths 
from all the fraternities, soror
ities, Mens Dorm Council and 
the YMCA.

about graduation, tickets (in 
case of rain), and calendars of

Moby Dick Declared 
Ugliest of All
Moby Dick, sponsored by Sig
ma Nu, was awarded the Ugly 
Mug Saturday night at the con
clusion of the week long UMOC 
campaign. Gross Carl, PiKAs 
ugly candidate took second place 
honors, while Miggs, sponsored 
by the North Jersey Home for 
the Criminally Bewildered, and 
Pear-BTP, took third and fourth 
place, respectively.
The winning ugly man re
ceived 17,717 votes of a total 
of 45,534 cast for the 16 con
testants. This converts to a 
$455.34 contribution to Cam
pus Chest.
The voting results were as fol
lows; Sigma Nu: Moby Dick, 17,- 
717 votes; PiKA: Gross Carl, 9,- 
877 votes; Miggs, 7,968 votes; 
Pear, 3,864 votes; Phi Kappa 
Theta: Big Red Ridinghood, 1,- 
680 votes; and Mens Dorms: 
the Mount, 797 votes.
Delta Tau Deltas Bill Kaye re
ceived 596 votes; Theta Xi: the 
Hungry Eye, 562 votes; Barry 
U. U. Shorthorn of WRCT re
ceived 534 votes; Tau Delta Phis 
La Laideu received 45 votes.
The Drone of the Pipers: 335 
votes; H. L. Q.s Rutherford K. 
Rotsee: 279 votes: Butch the 
Belch of Delta Upsilon: 255 
votes; the Tartans Klark Kent 
250 votes; and SAEs Dan Boughner: 161 votes.
It is interesting to note that 
Delta Tau Delta managed to 
contribute $6 to Moby Dick by 
buying two slaves to carry a 
Bill Kaye for UMOC sign, 
while Bill Kaye received a $5.96 
total.
Pass Pass-Fail
A grcup of students from the 
department of Administration 
and Management Science, are 
attackin ga problem which has 
been hinted at, skirted, investi
gated, and ignored by the ad
ministration, students, and fa
culty at Tech.
The pass-fail grade system 
proposal comes at a time when 
it is needed most. As we look 
to next year and to Carnegie 
University, we expect that the 
administration will enable Tech 
studens tcbroaded tehir educa
tions by venturing into courses 
which lie outside the bound of 
their profession. This can only 
be done, we feel, by instituting 
some form of non-detremental 
pass-fail grades.
I ntheir proposal, the Commit
tee on Pass-Fail Grading have 
recognized the need for this 
non-departmental freedom, and 
have also recognibed that there 
are some courses, such as re
quired departmental courses, 
which cannot be run in this 
manner. In addition, the com
mittee cite the decline of per
sonal grade-oriented, detremental competition whilh would re
sult.
Thus far, Student Govern
ment has not been contacted on 
this matter. The Tartan feels 
that the Senate, as well as the 
Executive Committee, should in
vestigate the possibility of re
instating the Senate Academic 
Affairs Committee. For the 
short run, we suggest that Dale 
Peschel and Tom Moore throw

Graduation Fees
All Bachelor, Master, and Doc
tor degree candidates are re
minded that the graduation fee 
of $10 per degree is charged to 
each candidate for graduation. 
This fee must be paid by mail 
or in person by May 15. Checks 
should be made payable to Car
negie Institute of Technology 
and, if mailed, sent to the Reg
istrars Office. To pay this fee 
in person, candidates should first 
come to the Registrars Office, 
W. H. 201, for the necessary 
cards to take to the Cashiers 
Office. If this fee is not paid 
by Commencement, the diploma 
will be withhheld.

lections including all-time Broad
way favorites. This group of 
22 highly trained and talented 
vocalists is widely acclaimed as 
being one of the nations finest 
male choruses.
The Army Field Band, which 
has been making concert tours 
since it was formed in 1946, has 
earned the title, the King of the 
Highway. It has performed in 
all 50 states, Canada, Mexico,, 
and the Far East.
Major Wilmont N. Trumbull is 
commanding officer and direc* 
tor of the band. Major Trum
bull has more than 25 years ex
perience in military music. He is 
a graduate of Bostons New Eng
land Conservatory of Music.
Two For the Road, Flam Man
by Tony Lawrence
The only nice thing that can be said for Two for the Road 
is that Producer-Director Stanley Donen has made an attempt at 
truly capturing something of what marriage is about. Other than 
that the film is rather aimless. The story, writen by Frederic (Dar
ling) Raphael, is of Mark and Joanna. In the beginning of the pic
ture we find them careening along in a new Mercedes-Benz, a result 
of his successful career as an architect, talking about getting a 
divorce. As the film goes on, we see them in four different cars 
and at the same time at four different plateaus in their marriage. 
What does it all mean? Who knows! As the flick ends, they are 
back in the Mercedes again but have seemingly resolved their 
differencestemporarily.
Though the idea of flashing back on the couple and their 
journeys is good, the story and screen play are hardly of the ex
cellent caliber as that of Darling. Mr. Raphael has supplied some 
totally idiotic dialogue and some even more hopeless gags. Donens direction is slightly better but not much. Albert Finney as 
Mark and Audrey Hepburn as Joanna are beautiful, handsome, 
wear all the right clothes and act as well as they can within the 
shoddy limits ox the script and characters. The music by Henry 
Mancini is good, as is the exceptional photography by Christopher 
Challis.
The Flim Flam Man is a horse, or a film rather, of a very 
different color. It is an unusual film in that all of the actors 
in it are from this continent and also it was completely shot in 
the United States.
The Flim Flam Man is the nickname given to Mordecai Jones 
(George C. Scott). He is known throughout the South as a con 
man. He carries an old well-worn suitcase complete with the tools 
of his trade; decks of cards, fake money, paste jewelry, etc., etc. 
As he is escaping from the clutches of the law he encounters a 
slim, young farm boy, named Jason Curley Treadaway, who is 
AWOL from Fort Bragg for slugging a sergeant that has con
tinually been on his back. They join forces and go around the 
countryside cheatingbut only the cheaters; dupingbut only 
those who are greedy and dishonest themselves. Finally, after sev
eral capers and a bit of romance, they are caught and put in jail. 
Curley promptly escapes but only to get Mordecai out and then 
turns himself in. The legend of the Flim Flam Man continues as 
Mordecai climbs on a freight train moving slowly out of town.
George C. Scott has let himself in as one of the strong con
tenders for the Academy Award with his brilliant portrayal as 
Mordecai Jones. Newcomer Michael Sarrazin is also fine as Cur
ley. Harry Morgan as the bumbling, inefficient sheriff, and Alice 
Ghostley as one of the town mothers, .bring some delightfully hu
morous moments to the film. Producer Lawrence Turman and Di
rector Irving Kershner have done a truly honorable job with this 
picture. They have caught the essence and meaning of the char
acters and the story. At the same time, there is ten minute car 
chase that is one of the most memorable ever put on the screen. 
Jerry Goldsmith provided the effective sound track. Put the Flim 
Flam Man at the top of your must-see list.
The above two movies reviewed were shown last weekend in 
New York at 20th Century Foxs First Annual College Weekend 
to which a critic from each major Eastern college paper was in
vited. We saw these two films and then discussed them with the 
people who created them. Though the two films have not as yet 
been released in Pittsburgh, they will be in town soon.

CYO Cancels 
Annual Jazz Festival
There will be no 1967 Pitts
burgh Jazz Festival. The Festi
val, sponsored for the past three 
years by the Catholic Youth Or
ganization, was canceled for 
1967 in a joint decision by Fa
ther Michael William, director 
of the Catholic Youth Organiza
tion, and George Wein, Festival 
producer.
Although the festival never 
lost money, each year $30,000 to 
$55,000 was risked in the hope 
of establishing a permanent ma
jor Pittsburgh Festival. Over the 
three years over 36,000 people 
have attended the nine concerts 
in which 67 major jazz attrac
tions performed.
NSF Awards Grant 
Historical Research
A team of young social sci
entists at Carnegie Tech has 
won a $93,000 grant for de
velopment of a computerized 
historical research program 
involving political systems in 
France and Italy.
Heading the project will be 
Dr. Howard L. Rosenthal, asj
sistant professor of industrial 
administration and political sci
ence in GSIA.
Dr. Otto A. Davis, economist 
and assistant professor of eco
nomics, and Dr. Melvin J. Hinich, statistician and assistant 
professor industrial administra
tion, will assist Dr. Rosenthal.
Financed by the National Sci
ence Foundation, the team will 
collect information regarding 
coalitions, voting practices, and 
candidate behavior in France 
and Italy, and will establish a 
data processing system for ana
lysis of those political processes 
and their relationship to the so
cial systems in which they func
tion. The study will take at least 
two years.
Speaker Presents 
Topic in Spanish
Dr. Peter O. Bonadero will 
present a film entitled Food or 
Famine and will speak in Span
ish on the Population Explosion 
and its Control at the next meet
ing of the Spanish Club of Pitts
burgh. Dr. Bonadero, a pediatri
cian in California, Pa., will pre
sent the came paper in his na
tive Argentina this coming No
vember at the PanAmerican 
Medical Association Congress in 
Buenos Aires.
The musical highlight of the 
evening will be the Six String

Through The Looking Qlass ?? ?
ibuniin of til
by Tim Bayie Siiirew
---------------------1
Lawrence Oliviers Hamletalthough masterfully acted and 
mounted-struck me as essentially a static film that has been dom
inated completely by the text, and by Shakespearean tradition. On 
the other hand, Orson Welles in his eccentric, theatrical way gave 
us Shakespearean films (Macbeth and Othello) that were filled 
with his unique brand of low keyed Kettledrum theatricalism; yet 
showed little regard for Shakespeare.
Somewhere between these two extremes falls Franco Zefferellis film of Taming of the Shrew. Although I was first taken 
back, with the obvious box office casting of Taylor as the shrill, 
domineering Kate, and Burton as her trainer, Petrucchio, it works 
very well in the film. I must state one thing, howeverTaylor at 
times in her nasal flatness sounded reminiescent of Martha in 
Virginia Woolf. Fortunately, however, most of the talking was 
done by Richard Burton, who inve&ted his speeches in a nice gran
diloquent style. Zefferellis attempt to make the faces, landscape, 
and color to evoke Renaissance painting also worked.
The production on the whole is a florid, colorful one that han
dles the poetry of Shakespeare with naturalness and vitality. The 
acting of Victor Spinetti, Cyril Cusak, and Michael Hordim also 
is uniformly excellent and comprises a fine colorful gallery of 
Shakespearean characters. The screen writers, although rather 
loose in their faithfulness to the Bard, have interjected dialogue 
and business that is in character with the original. With tongue 
in cheek, script billing goes to Zefferelli, Paul Dehno, and Susro 
Checchi DAmico, with a cop acknowledgement to William Shakes
peare without whom we would have been at a loss for words. 
Shakespeare has certainly received much worse treatment from 
film makers. In the original Hollywood film of Shrew the credits 
read by William Shakespeare with additional dialogue by Sam 
Taylor. Somehow this would strike me a little like having Mantovanni transcribe a Bach fugue. In this film, however, the quality 
and spirit of the production was worthy of this eternal comedy.
Also worth mentioning are the costumes which are often 
breath-takingly lavish. Irene Shariffs costumes for Taylor were 
particularly beautiful. Elizabeth Taylors not terribly obvious in 
this film anywaydeficiencies as an actress; my only complaint 
is that sometimes the show gets a little too cute and stagy. In 
general. Zefferelli has given a brash and exciting production that 
this Shakespearean work does not deserve the slow academic 
death of a classic.
Zefferellis next project, I read somewhere will be Borneo and 
Juliet; it should certainly be well worth seeing. As low comic re
lief and for the benefit of future generations, I reprint this sum
mary of Taming of the Shrew taken from VarietyLiz Taylor 
and Richard Burton is exciting box office fight in costume. Or 
boy beats girl.
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton can also be seen in 
Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which is being received in a 
theatre downtown.
Other things worth seeing around town are: To Kill a Mock
ingbird, downtown; Man for All Seasons, Oakland; Marat/Sade, 
out-of-town; the Experimental Films, tonight; and finally the 
Morewood Lobby at 1:25, where the Saturday night American 
Sublimated Sex Ritual is performed weekly, admission free.

Editorial . . .
Twelve hour meters 
For all-day, all-night reliei
The parking setup at Tech is in need of major revision.
The nuniber of automobiles on campus has increased, but 
the number of parkng spaces has remained constant, with 
additional complications being provided by the citys seeding 
of Forbes Ave. with short time limit meters to aid in pro
viding a rapid turnover of cars parked there.
The Tartan feels that the administration has waited 
entirely too long to remedy this situation, and that the rem
edies which are being considered (Tartan, April 26) are 
grossly inadequate.
Out of necessity, we should like to present our plan,
Which, we believe, would change the nature of the parking 
situation here for the better. First, we suggest that Tech 
tave over, as campus streets, Frew, Tech, and Margaret 
Morrison Sts. We are the people who use these streets and 
the city uses usfor revenue when the Park Police have 
not filled their monthly ticket quotos. This winter, as in 
winters past, there were no snowplows on these streets, and 
the weather made them crack even more than they had pre
viously. Naturally, the city cold-patched the streets, leav
ing gravel stewn about the campus. When the school takes 
over the administration of these streets, we suggest that a 
Skibo lot type of meter be installed, with the 12 hours for a 
quarter limit in force.
By pursuing the above course, the administration 
would gain enough revenue to take care of the streets and, 
possibly, hire a few more security men. The school would 
also be able to remove the taxicab stands from Margaret 
Morrison St., as well as abolishing some of the yellow lines 
whch have been painted without rhyme or reason in the 
citys motor vehicle and parking codes.
As for Forbes Ave., the meters there should definitely 
be changed to 12 hour meters, with the city and the school 
sharing the revenue. This would recognize the fact that it 
is Tech students who use these spaces and pay the over
time parking tickets. If the school gave up any revenue, it 
should go to either removing the street car tracks along 
our portion of Forbes, to improve the Forbes-Morewood 
comer situation, or to removing the present streetcar is
land and construction of bus shelters across from Theta 
XI, where the buses should stop, in our opinion.
The most important requirement in any plan would be 
a multi-story parking garage. We feel that the administra
tion should act rapidlyand openlyto determine the best 
location for such a facility, and should begin construction 
as soon as it is feasible. The Tartan does not feel that this 
should be placed behind Scaife Hall. Underground facilities 
should be considered, as well as an addition to the Fine Arts 
and Donner Hall lots.
The measures suggested here are in part, drastic, be
cause the problem is drastic. Students should their dis
satisfaction by writing to Vice-President Strathmeyer or 
the Tartan, which will forward the letters as a group. If 
administration continues at its present snails Dace.

Letters to the Editors
Students Support 
Pass-Fail System
Editor, The Tartan:
Recently, a group of students 
have shown some interest in get
ting Tech to adopt a limited 
pass-fail system. This group, the 
Committee for the Pass - Fail 
Grading System would like to 
see Tech incorporate pass-fail 
grading in non - departmental 
courses, so that students at Tech 
might have the opportunity to 
take courses outside of their ma
jor without fear of a low grade 
to bring down their factor. Thus, 
students would be more encour
aged to broaden their education. 
I think that the Tartan should 
bring up this issue, and also any 
students interested in the idea 
of a limited pass-fail system at 
Tech should attend the assem
bly scheduled by the Committee 
for Pass - Fail Grading. With 
enough student support this idea 
might be adopted, since similar 
plans are being tried at Mt. Leb
anon High School and Pitt.
Jan Shack 
AMS, 69
Editor, The Tartan:
A definite need exists for a 
more suitable grading system, 
one which is more adequate for 
all the students at CIT. I would 
like to see the adoption of a 
pass-fail grading system in each 
college at Carnegie Tech. I do 
not advocate using pass - fail 
grades for every course, but I 
think that the idea could be used 
effectively in non-departmental 
courses with each student choos
ing the system (regular or passfail) under which he would be 
graded.
Adoption of this method would 
allow students to venture into 
courses which they would nor
mally avoid because of intense 
competition, a heavy work load, 
etc. Students who wish to con
centrate mainly on department 
courses would feel no downward 
pull on their factors since passfail grades would not be used 
to compute factors. These are 
but two of the many advantages 
the pass-fail system presents to 
students. And although some 
students will feel that some dis
advantages exist, the system 
could be implemented in such a 
manner that a student who re
jects using pass-fail will still be 
graded as at present.
I would like to see the adop
tion of a pass-fail grading sys
tem as soon as possible. The 
student can only benefit from 
this worthwhile idea.

Do Students Deserve 
Skibo Expansion?
Editor, The Tartan:
In the past months, there have 
been numerous articles, editori
als, and letters in the Tartan 
concerning Skibo as an area for 
student recreation and activities. 
Many complaints have been 
voiced concerning the apparent 
slowness of the administration 
in supplementing the various 
plans and suggestions put forth.
I sometimes wonder, however, 
if the students at this school are 
ready for the responsibility of 
having expanded student facil
ities at Skibo. A prominent ex
ample of the irresponsibility 
shown by certain students be
gan over Christmas, when the 
very interesting decorations in 
the Skibo lobby were stapled di
rectly to the walls. This trend
has continued in an even more 
irresponsible manner with the 
current Student Art Sale. Many 
of the pictures have been hung 
on large nails driven into both 
the lower parts of the covered 
walls and into the lovely wood 
panelling in other parts of the 
room. Such wanton destruction 
of Tech property is totally un
called for.
If this is the way the Skibo 
facilities are going to be treat
ed, then perhaps the administra
tion should think twice about 
expanding or building in these 
areas.

Carnival Workers 
Given Thanks
Editor, The Tartan:
I think that everyone involved 
in the planning and operation of 
the 1967 Spring Carnival should 
be thanked for an excellent job. 
This includes everyone from 
Eaker to anyone who had any 
small part in building one of 
the midway booths.
This years midway was much 
better than last years, the bug
gy races showed hard work on 
the part of everyone, and the 
entertainment was better than 
ever. Almost every part of car
nival was improved in some 
way. Again a big thanks to 
everyone.

Physics, 69
Defense Given 
for Responsibility
Editor, The Tartan:
I, like many others on this 
campus, silently endured Mr. 
Malakoffs one-sided impressions 
of the civil rights movement. I 
cannot, however, let his letter 
of moral protest concerning 
the war in Vietnam go unan
swered.
First, let me admit that I am 
by no means an expert on the 
conflict in Vietnam. I do feel, 
however, that I, too have devel
oped some feeling of moral re
sponsibility. Mr. Matakoff says 
that he cannot morally condone 
our country's genocide. The 
narrowmindedness of his out
look sickens me. I may be the 
victim of American propaganda, 
but Ive seen pictures of the 
headless bodies of South Viet
namese villagers who dared 
speak out against the VC. Ive 
seen American corpsmen treaty 
ing the mutilated bodies of wom
en and children who got in the 
way when the VC bombed a 
restaurant or overran a village. 
I ve read accounts of how the 
VC slaughtered a village official, 
bis wife and children. I cannot 
believe, therefore, that any hu
man being has a moral respon
sibility to withdraw from a con
flict in order to give free rein 
to such atrocities.
In addition, I wonder how val
id are the protests of people 
like Malakoff when the South 
Vietnamese, themselves, are 
lodging no such protest. Why 
do the Vietnamese flee to the 
South and not the North?
Malakoff enjoys all the free
doms provided by our Bill of 
Rights. Last year he said in 
print that he would gladly en
dure jail in order to bring these 
freedoms, these civil rights, to 
his Negro brothers. Nov/, how
ever, he has a moral responsi
bility to deny these same rights
to his South Vietnamese broth
ers. Whos kidding whom.

Invitation Receives 
No Response
Editor, The Tartan:
I should like to report the re
sults of my public invitation to 
"any faculty member at Carne- f| 
gie Tech who is prepared to de
fend U.S. policy in Vietnam in a 
public forum (Readers Write. 
Carnegie Tech Tartan, May 3,
1967, p. 12): no one responded.
Though I suppose one could 
maintain that not all faculty 
members saw my letter or that 
there were those who had nei
ther time nor disposition to re
spond, there is another infer- V 
ence that grows more and more 
plausible: namely, that there is 
no faculty member at Carnegie 
Tech prepared to defend U.S. po
licy in Vietnam in a public for
um. On the other hand, there 
are many speaking against the 
war, and it seems to me that 
Tech students should know this 
about their faculty.
It may be useful information 
as more and more students be
gin to realize that they may 
have to confront the same mor
al dilemma as Michael Malakcff who put the question square-., 
ly in his letter to the editor last 
week: what to do if one is of 
draft age and finding oneself 
forced to choose between per
forming military acts he consi- \ 
tiers morally impossible to sup
port and going to the penitentia
ry (Ibid., p. 4).

Instructor of Psychology
Cultural Unity 
Should be Aim;
Editor, The Tartan:
Carnegie Tech has been tra
ditionally polarized in the two 
extreme manifestations of our 
split culture: one side we have 
a College of Engineering and 
Science and, at the opposite end 
of the spectrum, a College of 
Fine Arts. It is true that in the 
middle there are the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administra- t 
tion, the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences, and Margar
et Morrison College, but GSIA 
being exclusively a graduate 
school is necessarily specialized 
and cannot contribute too effec
tively to bridge the gap between 
the two cultures for the major'ity of our students; and the Col
lege of Humanities and Social a 
mciences and Margaret Morri
son Colege suffers from the op
posite drawback since they are 
undergraduate colleges and do 
not at present have the re
sources to contribute important
ly to the formation of a unified 
academic community.
We hope that Carnegie Uni
versity will succeed in integrat
ing our approach to scholarship i 
and education while achieving 
in the graduate schoolsexcel
lency in each field of specializa
tion. Some of us believe that the 
main aim in planning the new 
University should be precisely 
the realization of cultural unity.
(What we have and what we 
do not have seem to be favor
able to the pursuit of this goal: 
we have strength in the sci
ences and in the arts, we have 
scientists interested in the hu
manities and humanists inter
ested in the sciences; but we do

gone, marked by the passing of 
Spring Carnival. It is a sad sight 
to walk through the midway on 
Sunday morning and see the 
remnants of months of thought 
and effort. Summing it upthe 
surprises, the disappointments, 
the music, the midwayit was 
a tremendous weekend. Congrat
ulations to Steve Baker and his 
Carnival committee for a terrific 
job in making Spring Carnival 
1967 a success.
From here we must look to 
next year. By choosing next 
years Carnival chairman this 
spring, some of the more impor
tant considerations can be han
dled early. For instance, enter
tainment: Why should the con
cert entertainment have to com
pete with the baseball giune? 
Now is the time to arrange to 
have good, top name entertain
ment that will sell itself. Ticket 
prices do not necessarily hat 
te go up, either. In fact, prices 
may even be reduced.
There are other problems thart 
should be corrected by next 
year. One that was almost get
ting out of hand was the prob
lem posed by the teeny-boppers 
and gangs of toughs that were 
attracted by the music and ex
citement. It is frightening to
think that some Tech students 
were unable to safely go from 
the midway to Skibo without 
being harassed and even beaten 
by these gangs assembling in 
the parking lot. The situation 
was precipitated by the parking 
lot being darker than usual with 
some of the booths closer to 
that end being shut down. Since 
there is no hope of excluding 
these undesirable groups with
out shutting down the midway 
completely, preventive measures 
may require an alerted security 
force, brightening the dimly lit 
parking lot, and requiring that 
all booths remain open as long 
as the midway is open.
The students should be able to 
work more closely with the ad
ministration on these and other 
problems that confront Spring 
Carnival. In the past, the atti
tude has been to let the students 
handle their own affairs. This 
policy is changing, it seems, as 
it must in order for a weekend 
of this magnitude to function 
smoothly. Since Carnival at
tracts not only students, but 
most of the children and fami
lies in the area, there must be 
mutual cooperation in order to 
maintain the success of this 
weekend.

| Professor Glenn Miller, clini
cal psychologist of the Universi
ty of Pittsburgh, will talk on 
The Deceiver and the Deceived: 
Who Controls Whom in Per
sonal Relationships on Tues
day evening, May 16, at 8:15 at 
the YM and WHA, 315 S. Bellefield Ave., between Fifth and 
\ Forbes Aves., in Oakland.
Dr. Miller offers an analysis 
oi the way that people use each, 
other in personal relationships. 
The emphasis will not be on 
what we actually say or super
ficial talk, but instead on the 
substle unstated purpose we 
I have, and the hidden struggle 
for control of the relationship.
The lecture is open to the 
public.
But I digress. We were discussing mnemonics, which 
are nothing more than aids to memory  little jingles to 
help you remember names, dates, and places. For example: 
Columbus sailed the ocean blue 
In fourteen hundred ninety two.
See how simple? Make up your own jingles. What, for 
instance, came after Columbuss discovery of America? 
The Boston Tea Party, of course. Try this:
Samuel Adams flang the tea 
Into the briny Zuyder Zee.
(NOTE: The Zuyder Zee was located in Boston Harbor 
until 1801 when Salmon P. Chase traded it to Holland for 
Alaska and two line backers.)
But I digress. Lets get back to mnemonics. Like this: 
In nineteen hundred sixty seven 
Personna Blades make shaving heaven.
I mention Personna because the makers of Personna 
Super Stainless Steel Blades are the sponsors of this 
column. If I may get a little misty in this, the final column 
of the school year, may I say its been a pleasure working 
for Personna? May I say further that its been an even 
greater pleasure working for you, the undergrads of 
America? Youve been a most satisfactory audience, and 
Im going to miss you this summer. In fact, Id ask you 
all to come visit me except there is no access to my room. 
The makers of Personna, after I missed several deadlines, 
walled me in. I have no doors or windowsonly a mail slot.
I slip the columns out; they slip in Personnas and such 
food as can go through a mail slot. (For the past six 
months Ive been living on after dinner mints.)
I am only having my little joke. The makers of Personna 
have not walled me in, for they are good and true and 
gleaming and constant as good and true and gleaming 
and constant as the blades they makeand I wish to state 
publicly that I will always hold them in the highest esteem, 
no matter how my suit for back wages comes out.
And so, to close the year, I give you one last mnemonic: 
Study hard and pass with honors,
And always shave with good Personnors!

In todays column, the last of the school year, I dont 
intend to be funny. (I have achieved this objective many 
times throughout the year, but this time its on purpose.) 
The hour is wrong for levity. Final exams are looming.
Have you got a chance ? I say yes! I say America did 
not become the worlds foremost producer of stove bolts 
and cotter pins by running away from a fight!
You will pass your finals! How ? By studying. How ? By 
learning mnemonics.
Mnemonics, the science of memory aids, was, as we all 
know, invented by the great Greek philosopher Mnemon 
in 526 B.C. (This, incidentally, was only one of the inven
tions of this fertile Athenian. He also invented the house 
cat, the opposing thumb, and, most important, the stair
case. Before the staircase people were forced willy-nilly 
to live out their lives on the ground floor, and many grew 
cross as bears. Especially Demosthenes who was elected 
Consul of Athens six times but never served because he 
was unable to get up to the office of the Commissioner of 
Oaths on the third floor to be sworn in. But after Mnemons 
staircase, Demosthenes got to the third floor easy as pie 
to Athens sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes, his 
temper shortened by years of confinement to the ground 
floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of sense
less wars with the Medes, the Persians, and the Los 
Angeles Rams. This later became known as the Missouri 
Compromise.)
Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, au

TGIF Sponsored 
by AWS
There will be a TGIF spon
sored by AWS on May 12 held 
in the parking lot behind Morewood Gardens from 5 to 8:30 
pm. The Ithacas will play for 
the dance.
Renovations Planned 
for Morewood
Renovation of the Morewood 
recreation room will begin this 
summer. Final plans have been 
approved by the administration. 
The committee chairman, Sue 
Lohmeyer has begun purchases 
for the lounges. AWS has ap
proved a donation of $800. Re
maining funds will come from 
the administration.
The changes will include: 
Permanent partitions will be 
erected from the walls to the 
pillars. Area B will be left 
open; Area H will be com
pletely enclosed to form a mu
sic listening room. The main 
floor will be left open so that 
the room can be used for mix
ers and large meetings. Heat
ing, ventilation, and electrical 
outlets will remain unchanged. 
Lighting is adequate for most 
purposes, but lamps will be 
added for studying.
The walls and ceiling will be 
painted off-white and blue-green 
carpeting has been purchased 
for lounge areas. Sofas, arm
chairs, side tables, and table 
lamps will be used to furnish 
the partitioned areas, as in the 
plan. This furniture will possi
bly come from the main lobby 
and some chairs and tables have 
been purchased. Some floor 
lamps will be bought to light the 
tables. In area B, a juke box 
and food machine will be install
ed. Candy and coke machines 
will be installed first, and then 
coffee, pastry, ice cream and 
sandwich machines as demand 
warrants, as well as a change 
machine. There will also be one 
cr two ping pong tables in that 
area, along with tables and 
chairs.
Area A includes the main floor 
and the stage, which will not 
be changed and which will be 
used for mixers or for large 
meetings. Areas C, D, F, and G 
will serve as either a conversa
tional or study areas. Area D 
will also include a piano from 
the lobby. Area E is designed 
as a TV lounge, while Area H 
is designed as a music listening 
room. It will require sound
proofed walls and the purchase 
of a stereo record player. The 
listening room will be construct
ed last.
Retirement Tea 
for Mrs. Wilson
There will be a retirement 
tea held on Monday, May 15, for 
Mrs. Wilson, Morewood resident

PiKAs Shark Wins: 
New Record: 2:24.8
James A. Janke, Sports Editor
Pi Kappa Alpha broke the decade-old swepstakes record of 2:25.0 by two tenths 
>f a second Friday morning to win the 1967 Sweepstakes Championship. Beta Theta 
pis 0 finished second with a 2:25.8, and the Phi Kaf>pa Theta Shamrock was 
third in 2.26.5. The nameless new Sigma buggy finished fourth in 2:29.7, a recorded 
time for a first year buggy, giving the Zoos quite a bit to look forward to in coming 
races. The final heats on Saturadys were cancelled because of inclement weather, and 
although futile attemps were made to re schedule for Sunday, theweather then proved 
to be just as bad. The 1967 Sweepstakes trophies were thus awarded on Fridays 
performance alone, disappointing everyone but Pika, who emerged victorious.
The design competition---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------
proved to be intense even though 
Betas OO won easily as they 
did last year. The PKT Sham
rock edged the heavy Nu Liz
ard by only two points out of 
q nnssible 500, and only 18 
-dted the fourth, 
mtn, and sixth places in the 
design competition. (See list be
low).
Although Pika won the race, 
three other fraternities dom
inated the scene from then on.
Beta, Phi Kap, and Sigma Nu 
finished second, third and 
fourth, and also fifth, sixth and 
seventh in the sweepstakes com
petition, and in the design it 
again was BTP, PKT, and SN 
taking the first three places 
with Phi Kaps capturing fourth 
and the new SN buggy fifth.
ATO had much hard luck with 
both buggies, or the overall 
competition would have been 
closer yet. Although their bug
gies finished with times of 
2:30.15 and 2:38.0 and the 
Goose was sixth in the design 
competition, both buggies were 
disqualified because they could 
not pass the brake test after the 
race, which consists of being in 
motion for five feet and stop
ping within the next 30.
Although the times were fas
ter this year than in any pre
vious race, competition in the 
individual heats was usually 
very poor indeed. The only com
petitive heats in which a close 
race developed were in heats 
cne and seven between Sigma 
Nu and ATO.
Both SAE bikes were victims 
of accidents, but no one was 
seriously injured. PiKas second 
buggy had steering problems 
and could not negotiate the turn 
into Frew St., but neither the 
buggy nor driver was injured.
Canceling Saturdays races 
eliminated the chance of watchTARTAN
1967 Sweepstakes Champion
ing potentially the greatest bug
gy race in Carnegie Tech his
tory; since only 1.7 seconds sep
arated the first three finishers, 
Saturdays race would have been 
an attempt for BTP to sweep 
both the sweepstakes and de
sign, for the second time for 
PiKa to maintain their slender 
margin, and for PKT to erase 
the dark horse. But, under 
Mike Smolens direction, the 
1967 Buggy Race has to be the 
most exciting one-day sweeps
take in CIT history.

Golf Team Now 4-2
by George Smith
On the 25th of April Tech had 
a meet scheduled against West
minster and Allegheny at Meadville, but the night before the 
meet there was four inches of 
snow in Meadville. Neverthe
less the team did travel to New 
Castle to play Westminster. 
Westminster turned out to be 
a very strong team and the only 
one to take any points for Tech 
was JohnMulholIand. He halved 
his match and picked up V2 a 
point; Westminster had 7 V2. 
Onewas given to each man for 
winning his match and one 
point give nto low medalist.
The Fr iday of that same week 
Tech was scheduled to play 
Grove City away but one of the 
boys driving up was hit by an
other car and as a result the 
first four players never made it 
out of Pittsburgh. This meet 
was also canceled.
A week ago Tuesday, the 
team played an away meet 
against Waynesburg and Frostburg in about 40 degree weather 
and the pouring rain. The team 
finished very cold and very wet 
but they finished with two 7-0 
victories. John Mulholland was

Bethany Falls 
On Tartan Track
by Ron Finnin
Last Wednesday the CIT 
track team earned its sixth vic
tory of the year as it easily beat 
visiting Bethany College 93-52. 
Tech took the lead after the 
first event and was never behind 
throughout the meet. Tech took 
13 out of 17 firsts failed to 
sweep a single event except for 
winning both relays. The Tar
tans now stand 6-3.
The big man of the day was 
Jim Brezovec who ran the 440 
yd. intermediate hurdles in the 
record breaking time of 58.5 
sec. Jim bettered his own school 
record, set earlier this year, and 
for the first time captured the 
Tech bowl record. He also won 
the 120 yd. high hurdles on 
Wednesday.
Techs last meet of the year 
is this Wednesday as the Tar
tans travel to Grove City to 
meet their toughest opponent of 
he year.

not have, in between, a tradi
tion of vested interests which 
could keep the two cultures 
apart. In developing our less 
strong areas we should promote 
the unification of our academic 
life, rather than create new un
related islands of culture.)
Among the facts which show 
the existence of unifying trends 
in our campus we can mention 
the Seminar on Contemporary 
Ideas (C-730) which has been 
offered in the past several years 
to small groups selected among) 
the seniors of all our colleges 
The sessions of this seminar are 
conducted jointly by two pro
fessorsone from a scientific 
and the other from a humanistic 
disciplinewho have volunteer
ed for this kind of teaching, and 
are centered upon the discus
sion of books of common inter
est.
The professors who have par
ticipated in this program in the 
past are Hazard and Astley 
(Spring, 1964), S. DeBenedetti 
(Pall, 1964), Steinberg and Perlis (Spring, 1965), Mullins and 
Schoenwald (Fall, 1965), and Wolfenstein and Burstyn (Spring, 
1967).
Among the topics discussed in 
the past there have been Prob
lems of Science and Society,
 Problems of Disarmaments, 
The Future of a Scientific Society, etc.
Next semester (Fall, 1967) C730 will be conducted by Profes
sors DeBenedetti (Physics) and 
Woodruff (English) and the read
ings and discussions will revolve 
around the topic of Science and 
Values. On one hand it is plan
ned to investigate the attitudes 
and motivation of the men who. 
have contributed to the rise and 
to development of scientific 
thought, and on the other hand 
to study the influence of science 
and technology upon the ethical, 
esthetical and cultural values 
of our society. The ultimate am
bition would be to discover what 
is the set of values most appro
priate to insure a happy and 
full life for human beings liv
ing in a scientific world.
The participation in the semi
nar will necessarily be limited 
to a small group of seniors. For 
the more distant future, possi
bly the year 1968-69, when this 
institution will be a well-estab
lished University, the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
and the College of Engineering 
and Science plan to transform 
the Seminar for Contemporary 
Ideas into a course to be made 
available to larger classes with
out losing its character of an. 
open - minded interdisciplinary 
discussion. Students who will be 
here in 1968-69 are urged to drop 
a note to either Professor De
Benedetti or Professor Wood
ruff expressing their reactions 
to this idea.

Three Seniors 
Give Art Exhibit
Three senior painters and a 
graduate student will hang a 
show in Skibo Lobby and the 
Faculty Lounge next week. The 
show will run from May 13 to 
May 29.
It will include the major works 
of seniors John Muchmore, Donle Stettner, and John Blake. W. 
Don Guilliams is a first year 
graduate student in painting. 
The exhibit will include paint
ings and structures.
Baker, Will Anderson, and the 
rest of the Spring Carnival Com
mittee. The entertainment was 
the best weve seen in our four 
years here at Tech. Peter Nero 
was a welcome change in pace 
from previous entertainment, 
and the choice of groups for 
Saturday evening was excellent. 
Our thanks for a job well done.
