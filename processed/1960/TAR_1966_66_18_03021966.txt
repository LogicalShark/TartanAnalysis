Proposals Call For 
No Hours, More Apts.
Colonial Manor Apartments
Several proposals regarding womens housing regulations 
have been presented by the Association of Women Students to 
the Administrative Council for consideration.
These recommend that:
1. Juniors with over a 2.75 cummulative factor  in addition 
to seniors and women over 21 
 be permitted to live in offcampus housing.
2. On the scene maintenance ser
vice should be available at the 
Carnegie Tech-owned Colonial 
Manor Apartments (which will 
be opened to women students 
next semester.)
3. As proposed by prospective 
residents of Colonial Manor, 
either men should be permit
ted in the apartments without 
restriction or indefinitely during 
the weekend with curfew on 
weekdays.
4. Open Houses should be held in 
Morewood Gardens on every 
other Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m.
5. A-tower hours should be ex
tended to all seniors and jun
iors with an over-2.75 cummulative factor. (See Editorial, 
Page 4.)
The Administrative Councils 
schedule will not permit it to look 
into these proposals for at least 
two weeks. From the Council, the 
proposals will be sent to President 
Stever.
Possibly This Semester 
If he OKs the A-tower hours 
suggestion, permission forms will
SC To Review 
Tech Policies 
On Academics
The Academic Advisory 
Committee of Student Con
gress will hold an open 
meeting on academic af
fairs on Monday, March 7 
at 4:30 p.m.
The purpose of the meeting will 
be to obtain general student opinion 
and new ideas concerning academic 
policies at Carnegie Tech.
All students with complaints or 
suggestions of any kind regarding 
the academic program are urged 
to attend. Because a large num
ber of students have expressed a 
general interest in the operations 
of this committee, this meeting 
should serve to indicate what 
problems the student body is 
particularly concerned about.
Specific topics which will be 
raised are the present advisory 
system and the possible ap
proaches to faculty and course 
evaluation.
be sent out to the parents of all 
currently qualifying women. Hours 
will be eliminated as soon as these 
signed permission slips are re
turned.
Previously, mens and womens 
dormitory representatives made 
an Open House proposal to the 
Administration. This was reject
ed and countered by suggestions 
from the Division of Student Af
fairs that more lounges (the Blue 
Room, for example)be made avail
able on the main floor and in the 
basement of Morewood Gardens 
and that individual lounges, rather 
than individual rooms, be opened 
to men on Sundays. These sug
gestions, apparently, were not ac
cepted by dormitory government.
At present, next years seniors 
and women over 21 have the oppor
tunity to apply for residency in the 
Colonial Manor Apartments and Etower.

commodated in the 10 utility and

Dorm, Food Fee Increases 
Announced For 1966-,67
Strathmeyer, Tech VP, Cites 
Rising Labor, Commodity Costs
An increase in dormitory room rental fees, to average $40 per semester per 
room, and in charges for Food Service to average $25 per semester, was an
nounced today by R. D. Strathmeyer, Carnegie Tech vice-president for busi
ness affairs.
The rate changes, amounting to an average increase of 34 a day for room 
rent, a 20 a day food increase for women, and a 29 a day food increase for men, 
will go into effect next fall. The plan involves mens and womens housing, but 
not fraternity dormitory housing, nor married graduate housing.
Strathmeyer cited several rea
sons for the housing increase, in
cluding higher costs of repairs 
and replacement parts, new fur
nishings and supplies, and increa
sed labor costs in maintenance 
and custodial areas, especially 
maids and custodians. Another 
significant factor is the recent 
20% increase in water rates an
nounced by the city of Pittsburgh.
Strathmeyer noted furthermore 
that there already exists a cumu
lative deficit in the operation of 
womens housing, and that mens 
housing has just begun to show a 
deficit. Without the rate increas
es, according to Strathmeyer, an 
increase in the deficit of approxi
mately $59,000 could be expect
ed from mens housing operations, 
and approximately $49,000 from 
womens housing in the coming 
academic year, with even larger 
increases in the following two 
years.
A number of improvements 
have already been made in the dor
mitories, for example, the refur
nishing of wash room facilities 
in Boss and McGill halls, and 
the purchase of new furnishings 
and other appointments for im
provements throughout the dor
mitory complex. Strathmeyer an
ticipates that such improvements
Student Committee Suggests 
Changes In Skibo Policy
The Student Union Committee sent a list of suggested changes in 
Skibo Policy to the Administration this past week. The suggestions 
were made in order to help prevent any future outbreaks of trouble 
such as the one on February 5.
Bruce Handley, chairman of the 
committee, made the suggestions 
in a letter to the administrative 
officials. George K. Brown, dean of 
student affairs, responded with a 
statement to the effect that the 
Auxiliary Service Committee 
would meet to consider the 
proposals as soon as possible.
The suggestions are:
1. No High School affiliated groups 
may use Skibo.
2. Off campus groups may not 
schedule rooms more than one 
month prior to use.
3. The Administration should in
stitute a study concerning identi
fication card inspection.
4. All exceptions must be spe
cifically approved by a review 
committee except in emergency 
situations.
5. The review committee should 
consist of two members of the 
administration, Deans Brown, or 
Milich and vice presidents Binzer, or Barnhart.
6. All guests will be the legal 
responsibility of the student or 
group sponsoring them.
7. The faculty dining room may 
be scheduled for use after 7:30 
p.m. by the office of the Student 
Coordinator.
According to Dean Brown, some 
changes will be made, but the 
question is how drastic some of 
these will be. He feels that part 
of the problem has been the length 
of time in advance that organiza
tions have been able to reserve 
rooms. Previously, some groups 
have reserved rooms six to twelve 
months prior to usage. A time limit 
would help to alleviate the problem.
Dean Brown also stated that an 
occurance such as the one on Feb
ruary 5, is always a possibility at 
a school like Carnegie Tech. (Any 
urban school has the same pro
blem.)
But he said that the Administra
tion is now trying to improve the 
Skibo policy so as to make any fu
ture outbreak of trouble unlikely.
In an initial attempt to prevent 
further incidents of this kind, the 
Administration has employed 
Ernst Holt, who will control ope
ration of Skibo on weekends.
will continue and cited as an 
example the projected improve
ment of ventilation, and sun pro
tection in Donner Hall.
Rising Food Prices
With respect to Food Service, 
Strathmeyer explained that com
modity prices took a steep rise 
in the late spring of last year. 
The increases in the prices of 
pork products, other meats, and 
canned fruits were especially large. 
President Stever believed that it 
was too late at that time to give 
students and parents fair notice 
of a rate increase, and at his 
request, the current rates were 
continued into the present acade
mic year. It was necessary, 
however, to introduce some ope
rating economies, according to 
Strathmeyer, to break even.
The other reasons for the Food 
Service increase are much the 
same as those mentioned above for 
housing, but the changes in food 
costs were much more signifi
cant than those in costs of ma
terials and supplies. Labor costs 
have also been adjusted upward 
to give the school a more com
petitive posture in the Pittsburgh 
labor market. Without the increas
ed rates, Strathmeyer anticipates 
the generation of a $57,000 de
ficit in food Service operations 
in the coming academic year, with 
still larger deficites in the fol
lowing years.
Arrested Deficits
Food Services have not had 
a general increase since 1957, 
Strathmeyer noted, and room 
charges have remained constant 
for two years. Both services 
are operated on a no-gain, no
loss basis, and the overall ef
fect of the increases will be to 
arrest the total cumulative de
ficits and cover increases in wa
ges and services, and commo
dity prices.
It is hoped that improvements 
in management and supervisory 
practices will allow the school 
to meet future costs. Strathmey
er asserted, despite risii^ 
costs, we will allow no decrease 
in any service, and he expects 
that we can hold these prices 
now for several years.

Govt Tests For 
Draft Exemptees
(Reprinted from the February 
26 Pittsburgh Press.)
Officials have mixed the bit
ter with the sweet by announcing 
the dates for testing that may end 
deferments for college men along 
with a 10,500 - man cut in the 
March draft quota.
A Selective Service System 
spokesman said late yesterday that 
the tests for presently - exempt 
college students will be given 
May 14, May 21, and June 3 at 
1200 locations in the 50 states 
and Puerto Rico.
Earlier a Defense Department 
spokesman reported that increas
ed voluntary enlistments would al
low the cut in the March draft 
quota which had been set at 32,- 
900 men.
There was no immediate indica
tion that the enlistment picture 
would change the Selective Ser
vice plan to test college students 
in an effort to build up the man
power pool for the armed forces.
A draft official said there are 
1,800,000 college students now 
carrying deferments which, with 
low scores on the deferment test, 
could be lifted and make the stu
dents eligible for military ser
vice.
Draft headquarters said the test 
will consist of 150 items covering 
four categories  reading com
prehension, verbal relations, 
arithmetic reasoning and data in
terpretation.
The spokesman said the test 
will be designed so that there 
will not be any special advantages 
for any special field of major 
study.
The test will be prepared and 
administered by Science Research 
Associates, Chicago, which re
ceived a contract from the Se
lective Service yesterday.
Although passing grade levels 
have not yet been established, test 
scores will be compared with col
lege class standings.

Quite A Ball
Tartan Photo by Mike Perei
Beaux Arts Balls Cited 
As Elaborately Festive
Elaborately festive . . Beyound the wildest dreams . . . most distinc
tive.* Descriptions such as those were found in the Thistle, years ranging from 
1916 to 1954, in reference to the Beaux Arts Ball of the past.
Henry Hornbostel, originator of the Beaux Arts Ball, made his grand en
trance at the first ball draped in white, riding a donkey. As architect of the old
er buildings on Carnegie Techs campus, sponsor of Find Arts and instructor 
there, Hornbostel was voted favorite instructor in the 1921 yearbook and re
ference is made to his influence on the success of the 1921 ball.
In 1919 the ball was desig
nated The Design Ball and com
mentary on the ball was as fol
lows: The Fete Fantastique is 
a rather tame handle to give to 
the party that Tech painters, 
sculptors, actors, musicians, and 
architects had. The entire foyer 
and lobby were decorated and there 
was great feasting.
In 1922 the theme was Fiesta 
in Granada. It was described as 
the most distinctive and artistic 
of the Beaux Arts productions.
The decorations included a 15th 
century street scene and moor
ish temples. The gay proces
sion of guests into Fine Arts at 
9 p.m. did not end until 10:30.
A play was given and party-ers 
enjoyed food and a cabaret until 
four in the morning.
In 1923 the costumes at Kapers at Karnack  old Egypt  
were scantly fantatic . . . ela
borate for the scarcity of cover
age! the Ball included dancing, a 
banquet, and movies of Cleopa
tra."
Restrictive Tradition
The 1924 Beaux Arts Ball put 
many restrictions on requirements 
for attendance, which were adopt
ed as tradition in future balls.
Some of these were; guests were 
to be in Fine Arts; soul mates 
and casual acquaintances were ac
cepted dates and the dateless came 
too. The theme was Ancient Chi
nese and descriptions included:
hideous little Buddahs lured from 
alcoves .. . the costumes were 
varied and startling; the latter per
taining especially to some of 
them! The Ball lasted from 9 p.m. 
until a breakfast and following 
morning. A clever show by the 
dramats was the best put on at any 
ball, and surely did much to add to 
the flowing spirits of the occa
sion . . .  . . . There is 
something defintely barbaric about 
the Arts Ball. The period is al
ways chosen inthe same outlandish 
country and decorations seem but 
to furnish a back ground of gene
ral feeling of abandon, air of ir
responsibility to everything, and 
gorgous costumes . . . tend to a 
vivid, lasting impression . . .
The Ball, like the glory that was 
Rome, has passed into history.
In 1925 the theme of One Ara
bian Night provoked a skit en
titled, An Arabian Nite-Shirt 
and elaborated on the comforts 
and conveniences of nocturnal at
tire.
The 1926 Arts Ball carried 
through a theme of Kingdom of 
Fable. Tommy Christians Band 
(?) played through the night and a 
parody on Fine Arts and a buffet 
supper were features.
The next Ball was a revival 
of Beaux Arts, and after five years 
it was held  in 1931  on a theme 
of Old Spain.
In 1933 the theme was Holiday 
on Mars, and costumes were high
ly creative.
Wildest Dreams
The Beaux Arts Ball of 1935 was 
held in accordance with the old 
costume of the College of Fine 
Arts  a success that went far 
beyond the wildest dreams of its 
creators, and, it might be addedthose dreams were wild! Ara
bian decorations predominated 
(turbans, pantaloons, bronzed and 
veiled ladies escorted by jeweled 
and sworded sheiks and sultans... 
authentic costumes, lace curtains,
turkish towels, and Woolworths 
most expensive jewelry . . .) 
There was a moonlite Oriental 
garden, incense, and oriental food.
The Beaux Arts Society esta
blished in 1947 was comprised of 
outstanding students from Fine 
Arts who sponsored the costume 
dance. It was described as hav
ing great promise of becoming like 
the other Beaux Arts Balls 
sponsored by the society before 
the war.
In 1949 Thistle there is a note 
to the effect that the 1948 ball  
the Bali Ball  was a preten
tious affair. . . with heavy orien
tal flavor . . . and effectively de
corated hall ... and a snappy
program . ..
The 1950 Ball of the Granade 
Illusion was decorated in Black 
and white motifs. Couples, ar
rayed in extravagant costumes 
creating illusions of themselves, 
vied for the honor of reigning at 
the ball as emperor and em
press.
The 1953 ball was along the 
line of contrasts, with vividly 
striking decorations, and the win
ning costume was a couple who 
came as negatives.
Three Day Affair
The Beaux Arts Society of 1954 
expanded its objectives to three 
nights of activity; the first night 
invited all the Carnegie Tech StuTHIS "COUPON IS WORTH

Returns From Viet Nam
Stephen J. Orlando, 
Pittsburgh resident, has 
recently returned f r o m a 
seven and a half month tour 
of duty in Vietnam.
Orlando is a graduate of Cen
tral Catholic High School in the 
Oakland section of Pittsburgh. He 
has now re-enrolled as a student 
in the department of electrical 
engineering at Carnegie Tech.
As senior movement specialist, 
the Vietnam veteran was in charge 
of all paperwork of incoming and 
outgoing cargo on the new Delong 
Pier at Cam Ranh Bay.
Orlando was awarded the Ex
peditionary Forces Medal, the 
Vietnam Service Medal, and the 
Good Conduct Medal.
Commenting on the conditions in 
Vietnam he said, The people are 
for the most part uneducated, and 
there are no sanitary facilities. 
They realize that Americans are 
there to help them. Americans 
have encouraged friendly relations 
with the South Vietnamese people. 
A problem arises, however, be
cause of the poverty of these peo
ple. They are willing to fight for 
anyone who will give them food or 
other aid."
There were three-hundred and 
twenty men in Orlandos outfit. 
When asked about the attitude of 
the men toward the fighting in 
Vietnam, Orlando replied, " TTie 
men realize that they have a job 
to do and must do it. They are 
however, eager to get out of Viet
nam.
Orlando said about the morale 
of the men that, backing from the 
United States people is generally 
strong and that they realize that the 
riots were from a small minority 
of Americans. The Chinese com
munists as well as the North Viet
namese have made efforts to de
stroy American morale. Among the 
weapons used by the Chinese Com
munist government is Hanoi HanRadiation Processing
The womens division of the

na, a contemporary rendition of 
Tokyo Rose (who was used by the 
Japanese during World War n) 
broadcast from Peking, capitol of 
Communist China.
Orlando explained that, The 
rules of the Geneva convention 
followed during World War n have 
not been adhered to in the Vietnam 
fighting. He added that American 
supplies, including weapons, were 
constantly being captured by the 
Viet Cong. The Viet Cong was also 
able to obtain American weapons 
when the South Vietnamese people 
who had been given weapons by the 
Americans fled in fighting and left 
their weapons behind.
Orlando played football at Car
negie Tech before entering the 
service, and at Fort Knox, Ken
tucky, while serving in the Ar
my. He hopes to continue play
ing football by rejoining the Car
negie Tech team in the fall.

Let's talk about 
a career at Boeing...
50-year leader in 
aerospace technology
Campus Interviews Mon. and Tues., Mar. 7 and 8
The most effective way to evaluate a company 
in terms of its potential for dynamic career 
growth is to examine its past record, its current 
status, and its prospects and planning for the 
future, together with the professional climate 
it offers for the development of your individual 
capabilities.
The Boeing Company, which in 1966 completes 
50 years of unmatched aircraft innovation and 
production, offers you career opportunities as 
diverse as its extensive and varied backlog. 
Whether your interests lie in the field of com
mercial jet airliners of the future or in space
flight technology, you can find at Boeing an 
opening which combines professional challenge 
and long-range stability.
The men of Boeing are today pioneering evolu
tionary advances in both civilian and military 
aircraft, as well as in space programs of such 
historic importance as Americas first moon 
landing. Missiles, space vehicles, gas turbine 
engines, transport helicopters, marine vehicles 
and basic research are other areas of Boeing 
activity.
Theres a spot where your talents can mature 
and grow at Boeing, in research, design, test,
manufacturing or administration. The com
panys established position as world leader in 
jet transportation provides a measure of the 
calibre of people with whom you would work. 
In addition, Boeing people work in small groups, 
where initiative and ability get maximum ex
posure. Boeing encourages participation in the 
company-paid Graduate Study Program at lead

EditorialResponsibility
The Association of Women Students (formerly Wom
ens Dormitory Council) recently passed a proposal 
whereby all senior women and those junior women 
who have achieved a 2.75 or higher cumulative 
quality point average would be given, pending paren
tal consent, the privileges regarding hours now en
joyed only by the residents of A tower.
There are many senior and junior women living 
in Morewood Gardens who qualify for A tower privi
leges yet do not reside in the honors tower. This is 
especially true of sorority members who do not live 
in A tower because they helped fulfill the occupancy 
requirements of their sorority floors. The associa
tions proposal, if approved, would grant imme
diately to such individuals the privilege of extended 
hours, but would still, of course, keep them subject to 
other, dormitory regulations, such as the need to sign 
out.
The proposal was submitted to the Division of Stu
dent Affairs through Virginia B. Milligan, dean oi 
women, and will be discussed by the administrative 
staff one week from today.
The greater freedom afforded by such an extension 
of hours implies the imposition of greater responsi
bility on the individual. Certainly, by the time a woman 
student becomes a senior, or has demonstrated high 
quality academic performance up to her junior year, 
she has had ample opportunity during the first infor
mative years at Carnegie Tech in which to establish 
good study habits and to develop maturity, selfdiscipline, and a sense of integrity. Such individuals 
may well be trusted to act with discretion on their 
own responsibility.
In his recent address to the student body, Dr. Stever claimed, whenever the opportunity comes up, 
either to help students either to become more re
sponsible or to judge their responsibility, I am going 
to take it. To demonstrate how he has acted in con
formity with this idea, Dr. Stever explained, The ba
sic reasoning behind my decision last spring to esta
blish the honor tower in Morewood Gardens and to al
low women students over 21 with parents permission 
to live off campus was development of responsibility 
among women students.
With the proposal submitted by the Association of 
Women Students, a further opportunity has presented 
itself to develop responsibility among students. The 
Tartan urges that the administration approve and ra
pidly implement this plan.
In reference to A tower, Dr. Stever said, I have 
not been disappointed so far; in fact, Im pleased with 
the way it has worked out. Were the present proposal 
also to meet with administrative proposal, the Tar
tan believes that Dr. Stever would again be pleased.
Troika
Fact vs. Opinion
By John Day 
Don Carter 
David Henderson
We have always assumed that 
our readers are aware that Troika 
is an editorial. That is to say an 
article that presents our opinions 
on a variety of subjects.
We mean to make clear the dif
ference between an editorial and a 
news story, opinion versus a 
straight reporting of facts.
On last Wednesday a panel dis
cussion was held by representa
tives of the physics, history and 
psychology departments. They 
were acting in consequence to a 
poll which showed an appalling 
lack of general understanding by 
Carnegie Tech students of the 
Vietnam question. We do not ques
tion their motives on this issue, 
but rather applaud them. However, 
we do seriously challenge their 
means.
Operating on this premise of ge
neral ignorance on the subject, 
they set themselves to the task of 
explaining the facts of the situa
tion. Their procedure was to ask 
the assembled audience a series of 
three or four true or false or mul
tiple choice questions. Answers 
were then accompanied by a fur
ther amplification in the form of a 
loosely prepared statement. The 
floor was then thrown open for 
questions from the audience and 
the procedure was repeated 
through the twenty-two questions.
We must assume that Messrs, 
Bushkoff, Derfler, Helfgott, and 
Wolfenstein are aware of the dif
ference between fact and opinion. 
On this assumption then, the state
ments which followed the answers 
to the questionnaire can only be 
interpreted as a conscious effort 
to indoctrinate the tabulae rosae 
under the pretext of fact-finding.
This, to us, constitutes an abuse 
of the professional position and a 
breach of academic responsibility 
of the worst order.
These gentlemen have every 
right to an opinion, but they have 
also an obligation to declare such 
utterances as personal opinion, not 
to be confused with a clear expo
sition of impartial facts in an edu
cational context.
Had the affair been billed as a 
forum of opinion, had the panel
ists among their number at least 
one spokesman for the other side, 
or even had they answered the 
question, repeatedly asked, as to 
their own stand on our committ
ment in Vietnam, we would have 
welcomed the forum as an oppor
tunity for further discussion of the 
issues.
But the discussion had none of 
these things and having none of 
them, it could be only what it wasa session of indoctrination and 
propagandization under the guise of 
educational respectability.
The Search 
For Understanding
By James Panepinto
Isolated Man
Ultimately, each person exists 
in isolation. In loneliness, every 
experience is alive, vivid and full 
Df meaning  a persons sensiti
vity is heightened greatly. For 
example, when one has been great
ly isolated and restricted in move
ment, one can appreciate fully the 
significance of openness, of free
dom and expansiveness.
From what I have been able to 
determine about people who have 
strongly experienced what I will 
refer to as the lonely state of mind, 
it appears that this state of mind 
is often the result of a personal 
tragedy or chaos. For example, 
men lost in the mountains, in the 
desert, at sea; men faced with 
slow, painful death; men craving 
food and water; sense the agony 
and despair of loneliness. On the 
other hand,persons who continu
ally experience this feeling, in
stead of having it forced upon 
themselves by external stimuli; 
are showing symptoms of pro
blems of a complex nature.
m times of abiding loneliness, 
and suffering, one is forced to re
examine the value and meaning of 
iife. The search for a deeper 
meaning in life is stimulated and 
one is motivated to review the past 
and relive all incidents of impor
tance. Often the individual turns 
to accepting ideals he had before 
rejected, and rejects the complexi
ties of modern society in favor of 
a simple pattern of behavior, and 
a humble set of values. A per
son who is alone can savor the 
peace and quiet and solitude of 
loneliness long enough to find out 
if he really believed in himself, 
if his values in life held genuine 
significance and enduring meaning. 
This personal evaluation can only 
serve to enrich ones life, by be
ginning the search for a more via
ble means of dealing with himself 
and society.
I feel that the concept of lone
liness has real relevance for the 
individual in society today. Of
tentimes individuals avoid being 
alone to ensure that they wont 
have to face their values and real
ly question them. It is relatively 
easy to find people who believe 
as you believe, and will provide 
positive reinforcement to ones 
own values, irrespective as to how
shallow they are. Thus, the indi
vidual avoids conflict by not being 
in conflict with persons of dissent
ing viewpoints and reference 
points, and also avoids much of 
the excitement of life.
One interesting question which 
arises concerns the possibilities 
of obtaining the state of mind of 
the isolated, and the advantages 
which accompany it, without ac
tually isolating oneself from so
ciety. Many people who relate 
their experiences of loneliness 
have been isolated from society 
by outside forces, such as a hur
ricane, etc. However, the neurotic 
who walks along Forbes Avenue 
can be just as isolated as a man 
lost at sea, even though his be
havior pattern is significantly dif
ferent. One would most probably 
accept loneliness if it is forced 
upon oneself, but most people 
wouldnt consciously assume the 
role of a neurotic to reap these 
benefits.
Oftentimes the isolated man is 
viewed as a tree stump, incapable 
of producing fruit  incapable of 
providing real benefits for an in
dividual. One looks at the neurotic 
and concludes that isolation of one
self from society is bad per se. 
The means by which one can iso
late himself are seemingly left to 
the forces of nature, with no con
trol in the hands of the individual. 
However, as I have argued, the 
ability is to isolate oneself is bene
ficial within certain limits. Ex
periencing loneliness can be the 
stimulus to gaining a deeper in
sight and keener perception of 
ones values and the society in 
which they live.

From The Middle Of The Bus
By Michael Malakoff
Court Logic
We were soon transported from the hot, filthy Newton jail to the jail 
in Decatur. We were taken there for our own protection, because since 
the local restaurants had closed rather than serve Negroes, the White 
people had gathered outside our cell and made threats against us.
Our lawyers told us that the Negro girl was found to have been raped 
by three white men, not us. Our bond remained the same$500but 
we were fairly confident of being acquitted, if not by the city authorities, 
then by an appeal. A prison sentence of one year and a $500 fine still 
confronted us.
During my short stay in Mississippi, I had spent 15 days in jail on 
two charges. The charge of marching without a permit had been de
clared illegal by the Fifth District Court. The second charge, of rape, 
had been reduced to contributing to the delinquency of a minor when it 
was found that the felony had been committed after my arrest. The 
charges were definitely contrived by the local police in collaboration 
with local merchants in an attempt to stop our testing of the local 
restaurants' compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The Justice of the Peace was the owner of one of the cafes, the 
Rainbow, which had refused to serve Negroes, shutting down as they 
approached. But a court suit, filed against him and many others, 
made him eventually comply with the law.
An affidavit filled out by a local Negro against the Rainbow Cafe 
read;
*1, William , with two other boys, went to the Rainbow
C afe. We all stepped in the door and one of the cops there stepped 
up and said, get out, get out, get out niggers,* then another man 
stopped him from hitting us with a bat. Then the owner came and 
said, 1 can't serve you,* then the old man with a bat pulled out a 
gun and said, *1*11 get them out of here, get out, get out, get out 
niggers.* Then another on the outside of the place had a knotted 
cane that he walked on and said, *get out of here niggers before I 
belt you with this cane.* Then another man ran into us pushing us 
and saying, *What are you niggers doing in here, get away from 
here you niggers.* He said also, *You see these niggers run into 
me?* One man asked if he wanted to press charges against us, 
calling us niggers. He said, What's your name boys?* He said 
this over and over but we never said a word to them, walking away 
from them."
Our case, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, was soon to go 
before a grand jury. We felt that we had a 50-50 chance of being indicted 
for the frame-up. If indicted, we would, of course, appeal to the Federal 
Circuit Court. In fact most civil rights cases are appealed Immediately 
because at a state level, no justice as we know it can be obtained. Con
sidering that we had over 20 witnesses who would testify to the fact that 
we were conducting voter registration classes on the night in question, 
even a vague chance of being indicted was quite unbelievable. Of course, 
if we were not civil rights workers, the warrant for our arrest would 
never have been issued.

Tech Approves 
Varsity MC Club
Editor, the Tartan;
A keen interest generated by 
the Carnegie Tech athletes has 
brought about the rejuvenation 
of the Varsity **C Club. The 
club has been approved by Stu
dent Congress and the Presi
dent's Athletic Board, and will 
go into operation Immediately.
Initially, every varsity letterman will be eligible to join, and 
it will be considered an honor to 
belong to such a club.
The club will elect its own of
ficers, draw up a constitution, and 
run itself under the sponsorship 
of the Director of Athletics. Meet
ings will be held approximately 
twice a month.
Main Objectives 
The main objectives of the C 
Club are:
(1) to stimulate interest in the 
athletics of the college: (1) among 
students, Administration, alum
ni, and all others connected with 
Carnegie Tech, (11) in the sur
rounding districts.
(2) to attain a better understand
ing between the athletes of the col
lege and its faculty.
(3) to promote good fellowship 
among the athletes of the college.
(4) TO foster good sportsmanship. 
Some of the proposed subjects
of the C" club are a Parents 
Day, Player of the Week selec
tions in all sports, a lettermans 
dance, and fund-raising projects 
such as selling refreshments at 
football and basketball games. 
These are just a few of the many 
activities which the C Club will 
undertake.
At the present time there seems 
to be a very positive attitude by 
all (even the Administration) tow
ard varsity athletics at Carnegie
Tech, and now is the time to cash 
in on it.
Spirited Atmosphere 
An organization such as the 
C" Club might just be the cata
lyst that Carnegie Tech needs to 
spark the spirited atmosphere" 
and return varsity athletics to the 
level of prominence that they so de
serve. I truly hope that every eli
gible letterman will join and be
come an active member.
Each letterman will be notified 
of the time and place of the first 
meeting. A nominal fee of a few 
dollars will be charged for dues, 
and the amount will be decided by 
the club members. Any letterman 
interested in joining the C" Club 
is requested to get in touch with 
Fred Stone, Richard Merrill, or 
the Athletic Directors Office.
A letterman 
Richard L. Merrill 
(Mr. Merrill was fullback and 
co-captain of the Carnegie Tech 
football team this year.  Ed.)
RFK Recognizes 
Correct Solution
Editor, the Tartan;
It is unfortunate that the trio 
who composed the article RFK 
and the VC* were unable to see 
beyond the senator's political am
bitions and into what seems to 
me to be a reality.
I agree that Robert Kennedy 
is too ambitious, and that he is 
capitalizing upon the political 
magic of his name; but in spite 
of that he has accurately as
sessed the situation by saying 
that we should recognize the Na
tional Liberation Front.
One of our objectives in Viet
nam is to give the people a part 
in the government, and like it or 
not, the VC compose a sizeable 
part of these people. It is also 
unrealistic to exclude these per
sons from our proposed peace

negotiations since these are the 
very persons we are fighting.
It would be naive to forget that 
in most cases the National Libe
ration Front is just a mouthpiece 
for the North Vietnamese, but it 
is similarly senseless to say (as 
we are in effect doing) that one 
can have a democratic govern
ment in Vietnam when we are ex
cluding a sizeable portion of the 
Vietnamese from it.
We must realize that a demo
cratic government has the right to 
go Communist if the majority so 
desires, and this is why we can
not jexclude the VC from it, or 
from the peace negotiations. What 
we must do is give them a voice 
and get insurance that they can
not use illegal means to extend it.
I realize the enormity of the 
above task and hence I cannot 
suggest a resolution, but I in
sist that one must be found, for 
this is the only honorable way to 
meet our commitments in South
east Asia.

Probation Penalty
The Academic Affairs Commit
tee has approved the following 
statement on probation for inclu
sion in the student handbook.
Probation is a very serious 
warning given by the College Coun
cil and the Dean of the College to 
inform a student that his academic 
status is in jeopardy. It is ex
plicitly required of the student that 
he will make specified academic 
improvement or that he will be 
suspended or dropped.
Since Carnegie Tech considers 
its students intelligent and respon
sible, the student is held re
sponsible for improving his aca
demic status. No restrictions are 
placed upon his personal activi
ties while on probations."

NDEA Session 
In History
An NDEA Summer Insti
tute in History will be held 
at Carnegie Tech from June 
20 to July 29, 1966 under a 
$42,000 grant from the Uni
ted States Office of Educa
tion.
The program will be conduct
ed to affect the pre-service and 
in-service training of secondary 
school teachers in the fields of 
history and social studies.
A total of 24 persons, 12 twoman teams, will be accepted for 
the program. Each team will con
sist of a college or university 
teacher who is teaching or plans 
to teach a course in Methods 
of Teaching History in Secondary 
Schools, and a secondary-school 
critic teacher who supervises or 
works with student teachers en
rolled in the methods course of 
his teammate.
The full-time program (15 hours 
per week) will consist of one 
course, TTie Structure of Histo
ry." Structure will be consider
ed as a process of inquiry, as 
significant Interpretations, as a 
social science, and as a huma
nistic discipline. There will al
so be laboratory workshops and 
demonstration classes.
No academic credit will be gran
ted and no tuition will be char
ged.
Carnegie Tech is working close
ly with the Pennsylvania Depart
ment of Public Instruction in con
ducting the Institute. It is hoped 
that three of the 12 teams will 
come from the state.
Richard B. Ford, of the Carne
gie Tech history department, will 
direct the program.

IM Bowlers Now 
In Semi-Finals; 
Hoopsters Begin
by Mike Cooperman
Intramural bowling goes into the 
semifinals this Saturday after 
some close matches this past 
weekend in the quarters. E.J.s 
AM, the top team in the school 
during the regular season, open
ed up with a fantastic 920 in their 
first game against SN. They then 
proceeded to taper off but still 
won the remaining two games to 
get into the semifinals against 
GSIA. Meanwhile, GSIA averaged 
797 to win their three games over 
an E.J.s B team that bowled 
744.
The tightest match of the day 
went on between TDP and SAE, 
two teams that had bowled poor
ly against each other during the 
regular season. This time, both 
teams were on as TDP averaged 
821 to SAE's 815 and move into 
the semis. While SAE lost with 
an 815 average, ATO won the 
other quarter-final match with 743 
1 against a sub-par 708 perfor
mance by BTP.
Basketball
Basketball season now moves in
to its third week of play but, as 
yet, none of the top teams have 
met. There have been no key up
sets, and all top-seeded teams are 
undefeated in their leagues. This 
week should tell the story, as 
first - and second - seeded teams 
start playing each other.

Carnegie Techs Womens bas
ketball team traveled to Geneva 
last Saturday to avenge the mens 
loss earlier in the week, but saw 
what appeared to be a sure victo
ry turn into defeat when the Gene
va girls outscored them 11-1 in 
the fourth quarter to win 29-25. 
The game was the first one of 
the year for both teams.
Techs women, looking for im
provement over last years 0 and
7 record, led throughout the game 
and held a 24-18 edge going into 
the final quarter. Three Tech 
starters fouled out, though, and 
Geneva went on a scoring spree 
and then froze the ball to wrap 
up the game.
High scorer was Techs Elaine 
Bykowski with 10 points, follow
ed by teammate Jo Kissinger with 
9.
The Tartan girls played at Pitt 
last night, and have home games 
this Saturday at 1:30 p.m. against 
California State and next Tuesday 
evening with Indiana State.

Geary Andrews won two events, 
the 200 freestyle and 500 free

a season-long comeback for the 
Tartan swimmers, who lost five 
of their first six meets.
Penn-Ohio Coming Up
On Saturday Tech travels to 
Slippery Rock for the annual PennOhio Meet, which include Slippery 
Rock, Grove City, Cleveland State 
Westminster, Youngstown, and 
Lock Haven. The Tartans have al
ready met four of these schools 
this season, winning 48-47 over 
Cleveland State and 55-40 over 
Westminster and losing 67-26 to 
Grove City and 76-19 to SR.
In the last years Penn-Ohio

goals. The Tomcats didnt break 
into double figures until Tech had 
built up a 26-8 lead with eight min
utes left in the first half, and they 
trailed 38-16 at halftime.
Too Little Too Late
Tech has been a rather slowstarting team all year, and against 
Geneva they waited too long to get 
started and lost 75-66. The Covies, 
champions of the West Penn Con
ference, rolled up a 45-23 halftime 
lead before 2,700 noisy partisan 
fans while the ice-cold Tartans 
were hitting only 9 of 27 shots 
from the field. Then midway 
through the second half the Skibos pulled off their most specta
cular rally of the year, coming 
from a 63-37 deficit to six points 
behind at 69-63 with three minu
tes left. At this point the men from 
Tech ran out of gas, though, and 
the home team held on to win. 
The Tartans outscored Geneva 
from the field, 29 goals to 27, 
but sank only 8 of 14 foul shots 
to 21 of 30 for Geneva. Mark 
Lang had 18 points for Tech but 
Genevas Dom DiMattia took scor
ing honors with 25, 11 of them
on free throws. The fired-up 
Geneva players thus gained re
venge for an earlier 81-71 defeat 
at the Tech gym.
Lang, Morrison Hot
Prolific point production by 
Mark Lang and Ray Morrison led 
the Tartans past John Carroll Sat
urday night. Lang got hot in the 
first half to keep Tech abreast 
of JC, then Morrison hit. a hot 
streak in the second half to help 
his team pull away. As usual, 
Lang didnt start, but came in with 
15 minutes to go in the half and 
put in 18 points worth of jump 
shots and tip-ins to boost Tech 
to a slim 46-45 halftime lead. 
The Tartans held this edge well 
into the second half, then open
ed up a 12-point lead when Mor
rison drove and shot for 11 points 
in a five-minute stretch and Dale 
Masino, JCs big man, fouled out. 
Two other Carroll players fouled 
out in the closing minutes.
Lang finished with 29 points 
(high for a Tech player this 
year), and 19 rebounds, and Mor
rison had 20.
Last Home Game
Tonights home game with 
Waynesburg is the last home con
test of the year, last chance for 
CIT fans to see their team in ac
tion. One away game is left on the 
schedule, at Case Tech this Sat
urday.
Waynesburg has a so-so rec
ord in the West Penn Conference, 
but is certainly no pushover. In 
a previous meeting at Waynesburg 
early last month, the Tartans need
ed 28 points from Morrison to win 
81 to 73.

team a final season record of 6 victories and 6 de

Techs record-breaking basketball team finished its next-to-last road trip 
of the year last week by winning two of three games to boost its slate to 14 wins 
and 6 losses and assure itself of the best Tech record in thirty seasons. Even if 
the Tartans should lose itself their two remaining games, they will have a record 
of 14 and 8 and a won-lost percentage of .636. This tops the 1959-60 team (pre
sent coach Mel Cratsleys previous best squad) which won 15 and lost 9 for a 
.625 percentage, and the 1938-39 aggregation (12.7, .632) which tied for the cham
pionship of the old Eastern Intercollegiate Conference.
By beating the Waynesburg Yel
low jackets tonight at Skibo Gym, 
the Tartans can pass the 1931-32 
team (17.9, .654) and the 35-36 
team (15.8, .652). The only other 
Tech team that ever did better 
was the 23-24 edition, winning 
11 and losing 3 for a percentage 
of .786, a record that will prob
ably stand forever.
Last week the Tartans beat 
Thiel 65-46 on Monday, lost 75- 
66 at Geneva on Thursday, and 
won 87-79 over John Carroll in 
Cleveland, Saturday.
The Thiel game was more of a 
practice session than a contest, 
as all 14 Tech men who made the 
trip to Greenville got to play. 
Jeff Kalin collected 22 rebounds, 
an amazing figure considering that 
he only played part of the time, 
and Ray Morrison was high scor
