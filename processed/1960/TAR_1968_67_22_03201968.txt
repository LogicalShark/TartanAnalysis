650 Sign Petition Against 
Campus Military Recruiting
The Foreign Policy Forum has 
presented to the C-MU adminis
tration its petition with over 650 
signatures urging the immediate 
suspension of military recruiting 
on campus. Such action is deemed 
an appropriate means of pressur
ing the government to stop using 
reclassification of Selective Ser
vice registrants as punishment for 
those who demonstrate against the 
war, recruiting, or the draft.
General Hersheys directive to 
local boards last October 26 re
commended that the boards review 
whether a student s activities are 
always in the national interest; 
if the student has participated in 
illegal demonstrations he ought 
to be reclassified 1-A; and if there 
is good evidence that the student 
has violated the Selective Law, 
such information should be for
warded to a U.S. Attorney.
The American Civil Liberties 
Union has been asked to defend 
at least 30 men who have been 
reclassified since Hersheys state
ment was made. Although Gen
eral Hershey and Attorney Gen
eral Ramsey Clark jointly issued a 
clarifying statement last Decem
ber 9, the ACLU believes the 
local boards are still invited to 
judge the legality of protest act
ivities, to reclassify the protestors, 
and to report them for prosecu
tion.
The ACLU has filed a number 
of lawsuits in federal courts, in
cluding one on behalf of the Na
tional Student Association. Stu
dents for a Democratic Society, 
Campus Americans for Democra
tic Action, and 15 student coun
cil presidents, which asks the 
courts to declare unconstitutional 
the Hershey directive and the de
linquency regulations and to 
block their enforcement. Accord
ing to the ACLU. both violate 
the freedoms of speech, associa
tion and assembly, and the right 
to petition for redress of grievan
ces. Thus the dragnet sweep 
creates achilling effect on the 
exercise of First Amendment 
rights.
Furthermore, according to the 
ACLU. the directives provide 
punitive sanctions without def
inite standards for their applica
tion. in violation of the Fifth Amendment. They skip guaranteed 
procedural safeguards. They 
usurp the powers of Congress and 
the judiciary."
The highest existing precedent 
backing the ACLU allegations is 
the 1967 opinion of the U.S.Court 
of Appeals for the Second Cir
cuit in Wolff vs. Selective Ser
vice. The Court stated. There 
is nothing to prevent the prose
cution of registrants or others for 
conduct by them in violation of 
either federal or state criminal 
laws. . . . What we hold in this 
case is that it is not the func
tion of local boards in the Selec
tive Service System to punish 
these registrants by reclassifying 
them 1-A because they protested 
as they did the governments in
volvement in Vietnam. . .. Al
legations of the complaint in this 
case that the draft boards have un
lawfully suppressed criticism 
must take precedence over the 
policy of non-intervention in the 
affairs of the Selective Service.

Policy Names Profs 
As Draft Delinquents
Since November 1967. more 
than 50 young men have been de
clared delinquent for having re
turned their draft cards to Selec
tive Service offices and, sub
sequently. have been reclassified 
1-A (immediately available for 
military service), according to a 
spokesman for the American Civ
il Liberties Union (ACLU) in 
New York City. Among the draft 
"delinquents" are ten college fac
ulty members and chaplains who 
surrendered their cards to their 
respective draft boards in May 
and October of last year during 
demonstrations against the war in 
Vietnam. Seven of the ten have 
been reclassified 1-A. and two 
have received induction orders.
The ten are James M. Shea, 
assistant professor of philosophy. 
George Mason College, Univer
sity of Virginia: Henry Braun. 
Assistant English professor. Tem
ple University: David Thornburn 
and Michael Holahan. assistant 
professors of English. Yale: Gor
don Rogoff. associate professor of 
drama. Yale: James Matlack. assis

Reverend Paul Gibbons and Rev
erend David Connor, associate 
chaplains at Cornell: Staughton 
Lvnd. assistant professor of his
tory. Chicago State College: and 
Noel Brann. assistant professor of 
history. University of Maryland.
Although certain lqpal boards 
have been involved since 1965 in 
reclassifying war protestors who 
violate the draft law. reclassif
ication did not become Selective 
Service policy until last October. 
At that time General Lewis B. 
Hershey. National Director of Sel
ective Service, issued a letter to 
all local boards advising them to

SCORE - An Organization 
For the Responsible Student
by Lea Wanetik
,huh Payne and Len Wanetik, coordinators of SCORE.
Qn Wednesday, 13 March
1968, a group of students held 
a meeting in the offices of the 
1ConCu to form wpioh the Stu
dent Cooperative Organization 
for Responsibility in Education.
Project Sponsored 
In Voter Education
For an unusual and important 
way to spend Spring Break this 
year a voter registration - educa
tion project will be held around 
the coming vacation period. Em
phasis will be on voter education 
as well as the practical experi
ence of registering prospective 
voters. The project, made up of 
participants from colleges all 
over the country, is scheduled for 
April 6-13th in Chicago, Illinois, 
and is open to any interested 
CMU students.
The primary purposes of the 
project are: 1) to help local
groups with voter education for 
implementing the Civil Rights

Presidential and Vice-Presi- < 
dential platforms for stu- j

printed in the March 27th | 
TARTAN. All platforms must 
be in the Office by 4:30 pm 
March 22. They will not be 
accepted for publication af-1
ter that time. INCLUSIVE.^
1They must be typed using a h 
64-space line, double spae-< 
ed, and in duplicate.
The students present express
ed a wide range of opdnoins and 
probably, by now, some word 
about wpioh has reached you. 
The story is probably distorted, 
however, and this article is Mhs
termined to describe the for
mulation of the ideas behind 
wpioh and the policies which 
wpioh intends to pursue.
As a group, the members of 
Score believe that Student Gov
ernment serves no purpose on 
this campus other than the one 
most adequately described in 
Gary Strausss article elsewhere 
in this issue and, for this rea
son, should be abolished.
Reasons for the abolition will 
be given later in the article.
Second, the vehicle for abol
ition will be a campus wide ref
erendum (conducted by wpioh 
without the sanction of Student 
Government or the Administra
tion, but with the votes to be 
counted by Alpha Phi Omega.) 
This referendum will be held 
prior to the Student Govern
ment elections.
Third, no alternative struc
ture will be offered to replace 
Student Government. But inter
ested students, organizations 
and groups, for the first time 
will be able to confront the Ad
ministration directly on issues 
concerning them.
Fourth, students in this some
what modified situatk>n would 
take on more responsibility iu 
the individual level for their ac
tivities and, Score believes, this 
would accomplish the education
al goal of convincing the stu
dent that his desires can have 
an effect on the power struc
ture and that change can be In
stituted by individuals.

EDITORIAL An Apology
There have been more than several times during the past 
year when this paper has been accused of not putting forth the 
real issues and desires of the student body.
I must now admit that these charges have been, unfortun
ately, true. This paper has operated under the guise of freedom 
of the press whild denying the student body vital information-information which, were it published, would change attitudes on
this campus severly.The manner in which the above information has been kept 
quiet in this and in past years has been through the device of 
"privileged information, i.e., we were honor bound to print only 
that part of the truth which the administration desired be prin
ted, even through we knew full well that there was much more 
to the story.
We have betrayed you, the students, by maintaining a high 
degree of this privileged information.
We have betrayed you by not providing you with suffic
ient information to make your feelings known.
We have betrayed you by not pressing your causes actively 
to the administration, or by not aiding you properly in pressing 
your causes.
I hope to tell you that those days are over.
There are those who will say, Oh yes, he is retiring as 
editor - he can say those things now. All I can do is assure 
you that I shall pick my successor mainly on his desire and abil
ity to carry out the publishing of the truth. I can assure you of 
no more than that -- but I feel that that is quite a bit in itself.
There are also those who will say, This is just Wanetiks 
last gasp -- his last act of destruction before leaving. To them, 
I can say only this. People wake up to problems at various stages 
in their lives. Although it is a source of great embarrassment 
to me. I must admit that I have deluded myself for three 
and a half years now, and that events in my life in the past few 
months have made me realize the importance of individual free
dom and sincerity.
It is true that it is not the best policy to be openly hostile 
toward the administration of this school. However, we must be 
honest with each other. If honesty hurts --if the truth breeds 
damage and evil, then let it be so.
Now, how are we going to set up the world so that the truth 
may have a chance to show itself?
First of all, I hereby declare an end to priviledged informa
tion. We shall respect release deadlines, but reporters will be 
bound to report what they hear - not what they are told to 
hear.
Second of all, we shall be presenting blatant opinions in the 
paper. We shall no longer be bound by our won self interests, 
we pledge ourselves to consider the needs of the student body 
before the need for us to remain budies with President Stever or Dean Brown.
Third, as stated above, we shall attempt to appoint a succes
sor who will continue this policy.
Finally, it is the policy of this paper to support SCORE 
or any other organization which is attempting to directly con
front the admisistration.
It is only within that context that the truth can be known. 
There are probably some who are reading this and are in 
violent disagreement with our policy. Fine.
This is the way things are. This is the policy we are follow
ing and are going to follow. If you disagree with us, you can 
bitch to the nearest TARTAN staff member or SCORE organizer. 
Bitch to him, and hell bitch back to you. Constructively. 
But for those of you who are waking up to delusions, or 
who have already awakened, we issue a call to join us now, 
either as members of the staff or the paper or as members of 
SCORE.
Now is the time.
Note: To those of you who couldnt give a damn one way or 
the other .... to those of you who are happy in your dreams . .. 
to those of you who are content, we say this. Apathy is its own 
reward, and don4; expect a damned thing from the adminis
tration.

Letters to the Editor
Editor, The Tartan:
We, as a small part of the read
ing community refered to in the 
editorial of Wednesday, March 
13, 1968. wish to express our 
thanks to you and your staff for a 
publication which we have found 
to be consistently above par in 
most areas. Since we obtain cop
ies of both The Tartan and The 
Pitt News weekly, we feel qual
ified to say that not once has the 
Pitt paper come even close to 
the sophistication and original
ity of ideas expressed in the CMU 
publication. As a specific example 
of what we mean, we would call 
your attention to the February 
7, 1968 issue of the TARTAN 
which in our unsolicited opinion 
was the finest edition of that 
paper to be printed this semester. 
In this issue were a variety of ar
ticles, most of which, if not ter
ribly witty, were at least intelli
gent and readable. One section of 
The Tartan that we never fail 
to find exceptionally amusing is 
the letters column. You couldnt 
give your readers more laughs if 
you ran a comic strip. Again our 
thanks for an excellent, newspa

M.C.N.R.Student Government 
Equals Stimulation?
Editor, The TARTAN:
Student Government Meetings:
What do you think of the Stu
dent Government Meeting last 
Thursday?
1. Student who?
2. I think it was really great 
and wonderful and I likecTit a lot 
and I think they ought to go on 
the road with their show.
3. Is WRCT going to make 
them a regular weekly special?
4. They accomplished little or 
nothing in all their meeting time. 
They just quibbled over one tiny 
point.
These are responses to my questionion of a few non - student 
government members who were 
present at last Thursdays preState of the University Address. 
This meeting was the first that 
this reporter has ever witnessed. 
May it be the last.
The meeting lasted approximat
ely one hour. Fifteen minutes 
were devoted to Spring Carnival 
issues. Around fifteen or twenty 
minutes took care of a few small 
issues. And half an hour was 
spent quibbling about a Student 
Senate vote of money for the AFPF speaker, versus the executive 
councils right to veto the alloca
tion and to be the sole overseers 
of the members of the commit
tee to govern spending.
This last discussion soon left 
the AFPF and its speaker far be
hind. The congress was involved 
in its power to approve appoint
ments, etc. The Executive Coun
cil (which is made up of appoin
ted members except for Dale Peschel) finally proved that it had 
a perfect right to veto the Stu
dent Congress (made up mostly 
of elected members who are sup
posed to represent the feelings of 
the student body.)
Attending this engrossing and 
stimulating monotone discussion 
were about twenty members of 
Student Government and ten 
members of the rest of the cam
pusmostly members of 3jv1 
and the 1ConCu who were pre
paring to reproduce and report the 
State of the University Address 
which immediately followed the 
regular meeting. Most of us felt 
that those members of Student 
Government who went to sleep or 
who had obviously set silence the 
mode in order to ignore anything 
said after they had read their pre
pared statements, were probably 
receiving the whole thing with 
the best attitude.
All in all the meeting did little 
or answer my question,

The Arena
Three-Fourths of the Way 
With RFK
by Len Wanetik
This past week, Senator Robert Kennedy announced his candid
acy for the Presidency of thd United States. Some cried immediately, 
as did Ronald Reagan, Opportunist! Others implied that Mr. Ken
nedys move was less than fair.
I am not of that opinion. Politics must be recognized for what it 
is. It is not a teasip. It is, if anything, the game of opportunism, of 
making the right move at the right time. Politics may be conducted 
in one of two ways, however. There is the dirity, underhanded, armtwisting politician who gets things done by sheer force if nothing 
else. Lyndon Johnson is such a politician.
And then, there are the appealing, rhetoric-using, persuading 
politicians. John Kennedy was such a man. He was effective in the 
international arena, where rhetoric combined with the proper use of 
force is a virtue. However, in dealing with the Congress, an attempt 
to pass his Civil Rights bill and domestic programs, he was at a distinct 
disadvantage when compared to the wily, experienced Johnson.
In like manner, Johnson is at a disadvantage in international af
fairs because he is an American politician- a back slapping, hand shak
ing, knish pizza-egg roll eating, wheeler dealer who is perfectly wil
ling to use force before that becomes necessary.
Now, given these two propositions, we must evaluate Mr. Ken
nedys move. It was made, apparently, at the right time. It gave Mr. 
Kennedy the opportunity to assess the mood of the country with repect to McCarthys candidacy. It was right before the St. Patricks 
Day parade. It followed a week of open debate in the Senate where 
Kennedy had had an opportunity to eloquently voice his opinions on 
the conduct of the war. It followed the passage of a Civil Rights piece 
of legislation, something to which John Kennedy had been strongly 
attached. It was made at a time when Jacqueline Kennedys name is be
ing bandied about in the papers along with that of Lord Harlech. It 
was made following the withdrawal of Romney, and the subsequent 
unrest in the Republican party, which led to a meeting in Governor 
Rockefellers apartment.
All in all, it would appear that the time to move had presented 
itself, and that at no other time, would things be so ripe. Given that, 
and the nature of politics, Kennedy would bave been odd indeed had 
he not followed his political training and stepped in.
How is Kennedy as a candidate? Some feel that he should have 
waited four more years. But if he loses, he can still wait. In all, he 
comes to the candidacy with about the same qualifications as his 
brother. We have forgotten, perhaps, exactly how bad the Bay of 
Pigs was. We have tended to forget John Kennedys weannesses dur
ing the election and immediately after.
Most of us have forgotten the reports of the reports of the poli
ticking which occurred during the primaries in D9Nq and the maneu
vering which went on at the concention.
The opportunism was there, too. Robert Kennedys main weakness lies in his ihability to hide it as well as his brother did. In order 
to present a strong challenge, he will have to guard himself and his 
speeches closely. He will have to play the rhetorical as well as the 
back slapping side of the game.
Although it is too early to guess the outcome of the convention,
I should like to suggest possibilities for the coming months. Johnson 
may well back out yet. He has pulled surprises before, and may do so 
again. He has two choices as a politician. Either he pulls the fat out of 
the fire in Vietnam and at home (which is not altogether impossible 
for a politician) or he honorably thinks of some excuse, such as ill 
health, to withdraw. I believe he will take the latter approach. McCar
thy would be foolish indeed to attempt to maintain a totally antagon
istic approach to Kennedy. They are operating in basically the same 
market. They cannot afford to split it up. And Kennedy is a far better 
politician.
.'What may emerge is a Kennedy-McCarthy ticket. It is unbalanced 
as far as presenting a Southern influence is concerned, but the days 
of delusion are over. The Dixiecrats are gone. It does present two men 
who are geographically separated, who appeal to the young voters, 
who are pledged to end the war, and who have worked on domestic 
problems as well. In addittion, it has the Kennedy name.
And in the game of fopportunism, that is not to be considered 
lightly.

Students who worked part-time 
during the summer may have a 
refund coming on their 1967 Fed
eral Income Tax returns. H. Alan 
Long, District Director of Inter
nal Revenue for Western Pennsyl
vania, said today.
Students are required to file a 
tax return if they earned $600 or 
more. If they earned less than $600 
and taxes were withheld from wag
es by their employers, they must 
file a return to obtain refund of 
the tax withheld.
Unmarried students who earn 
less than $900 will not owe any 
Federal Income Tax. They are en
titled to claim the usual $600 per
sonal exemption, plus a $300 min
imum standard deduction.
Students are entitled to claim 
their own personal exemption 
when filing a tax return. Mr. Long 
said. Parents who furnish more 
than one-half the cost of support 
for their child who is a full-time 
student may also claim him as an 
exemption on their tax return, un
less the child is married and is 
filing a joint return with his or 
her spouse.prwiorwiT* ******** ********************************

Foreign students completing 
their studies at college and uni
versities across the U. S. are be
ing invited to participate in the 
12th annual Summer Crossroads, 
an international get-together to be 
held June 9 - 15 at Colorado 
Springs, Colorado.
Planned by the Rocky Mountain 
office of the Institute of Inter
national Education with The Col
orado College and Colorado 
Springs families. Summer Cross
roads is a unique program for in
ternational experience. In a week 
of activities, ti gives visiting stu
dents from around the world the 
chance to relax and reflect on 
their American experience in an 
atmosphere of freedom, informal
ity and fellowship.
Participants live with Colorado 
Springs families, sharing freely 
in American Family Life. Dur
ing each day, they come together 
at The Colorado College to ex
change views on timeless subjects 
education, marriage and childrearing customs, politics, eco
nomic development, religion, etc. 
In between they have parties and 
picnics and explore the Colorado 
Rockies. At the end of the week, 
they have an international sup
per including native dishes they 
have cooked in fellowship with 
their hosts.
In turn, host families believe 
that they get at least as much 
from the experience as do their 
visitors. Except for personal in
cidentals. the hosts pay thd ex
penses for the weeks activities, so 
that the student only has to pay 
his transportation to the city 
-- which some students manage 
with car pools and tourist-type
bus tickets.
To participate in Summer Cross
roads, one must submit a brief ap
plication form, available from the 
Foreign Student Adviser on his 
campus. Applications must be 
mailed before May 1. to Dr. 
Joseph Pickle, Director, Summer 
Crossroads, The Colorado College 
%Colorado Springs, Colo. 80903. 
Forms may be obtained from Dr. 
Pickle, or from the Institute of 
International Education, Rocky

S. G. Must Become More 
Effective or No Longer Exist
Spectrum of Opinions, Policy Names Profs As Draft Delinquents
Ft JCah mhrpPha
The perennial question among 
students on this campons is 
What has Student Government 
done? Hopefully, this report 
will convey some idea of just 
that.
First of all, some of the prob
lems Student Government faced 
this past year and will face in 
the future indude communica
tion, identity and purpose. The 
communication problem exists 
between the student and Student 
Government, between the stu
dents and the administration, 
and even within Student Gov
ernment itself. There were some 
attempts to bridge this com
munication gap such as with 
the Senate Publicity Committee, 
putting up bulletin boards and 
publicizing the Senate minutes, 
but largely the problem still 
exists.
The second problem is more 
or less an internal one. Student 
Government has, consciously or 
unconsciously, tried to establish 
an identity and justify a pur
pose. This problem at times was 
accentuated by a lack of under
standing with Student Govern
ment about the true power of 
the Senate and the Executive 
Council. Perhaps too much time 
was lost when Student Govern* 
ment tried to identify and re
structure this power, but to un
derstand the problem is the first 
step to the solution.
In the coming year, the Stu
dent Government will have to 
face up to specific issues, in
cluding the Vietnam War, the 
question albout the new H&SS 
college and Student Power. In 
the past, Student Government 
has remained unpolitically ori
ented. However, as these issues 
become more and more impor
tant to students, Student Gov
ernment may have to take rep
resentative stand, even to the 
point of leading the students on 
an issue. Some individuals, 
though, feel that until there is 
significant opinion expressed by 
the students on these issues, 
Student Government should re
main neutral. Neutrality, then, 
is also an issue to be questioned.
XHiring the year there have 
been a number of changes in 
Student Government. There was 
one new amendment, which 
changed the number of signa
tures required on Senators pe
titions from 50 to 25. It was 
hoped that this would enable 
more interested students to fill 
the Senate. There were also 
amendments which were passed 
in the Senate, .but vetoed by 
Executive Council. These were
on such matters as elections to 
fill empty Senate seats, new re
quirements for the Student Gov
ernment treasurer, and Senate 
approval of all external com
mittee chairmen appointments 
(currently the responsibility of 
Executive Council).
Other changes include new 
committees. In the Senate, there 
was one new internal committee 
createdthe Pubilicity Commit
tee. Under Chairman Gary Stra
uss, this committee was to pub
licize the events of Student Gov
ernment. Two new external com
mittees set up by Executive 
Council were the Social Services 
Committee and the Policy Co
ordination Committee. The first 
was established to promote so
cial awareness on the campus, 
and is now co-ehaired by Jacqui 
Pratt and Gordon Cohn. The 
second new external committee 
is the Policy Coordination Com
mittee, which was set up to co
ordinate the interests of various 
policy groups on campus (such 
as AFPF, YAF, Young Republi
cans, etc.)
The student general court is 
also undergoing change. The 
Student Justices are conducting 
a study to evaluate the purposes 
of the court, and to recommend 
a future for the court, whether 
it be to abolish the court or just 
suggestions to improve its effi
ciency.
(In this report given at the 
Senate meeting on 14 March the 
committee reports and sugges
tions were included, but for the 
sake of brevity they will not be 
included here. This information 
is available, however, to anyone 
who is specifically interested.)
In conclusion, I might add 
that there is one new problem 
which student government will 
be facing, and that is abolition. 
At the same time, until a suit
able alternative is presented, I 
feel a responsibility to defend 
Student Government. In doing 
so, there are a number of ques
tions that must be asked: What 
is Student Government? Whose 
purpose does it serve? Why 
should it exist? At the same 
time, where were the people 
with the solutions during all 
of this year, and why are they 
only making themselves heard 
now?
This question is healthy, as 
there are two alternatives  
either Student Government will 
no longer exist, or it will be
come more effective than ever 
in representing the interests of 
the students.

The Foreign Policy Forum is 
sponsoring an open forum en
titled The Draft, the Univer
sity and You on Monday, March 
25, at 8 pm in the the GSIA audi
torium. Speakers of diverse opin
ion have been invited so that 
the entire spectrum of current 
opinion will be presented.
The forum will be opened by 
David Cohen, professor of law 
at the University of Pittsburgh, 
who will discuss the Selective 
Service systemits concept, his
tory and operation. He will be 
followed by a member of the 
administration of CMU who will 
speak on the current draft law 
and its effects on the academic 
community. Thomas Kerr, pres
ident of the Pennsylvania Amer
ican Civil Liberties Union, will 
present the legal implications of 
the alternatives available to po
tential draftees. The forum will 
conclude with presentations by 
three students who have chosen 
widely divergent means to satis
fy their obligations as citizens. 
They are Joshua Chason of the 
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance; 
Paul Kleindorfer, president of 
the Pittsburgh Veterans for 
Peace; and Gene Payne, senior 
in the department of adminis
tration and management science.
Those present will be able to 
question each speaker at the 
conclusion of his presentation.

reclassify and make available tor 
immediate induction registrants 
whose speech, conduct, and other 
protest activities are found to vio
late Selective Service rules and re
gulations.
For the ten professors and chap
lains who turned in their draft 
cards, reclassification means the 
loss of deferments based on oc
cupational and familial status. The 
seven who have been reclassified 
are all over 26 years old. the age 
which has generally been the 
cutoff point for induction. Henry 
Braun is 38, three years beyond 
the maximum age for draftees.
Legal action in behalf of the 
seven student delinquents has been 
initiated by ACLU attorneys in 
federal district courts in New 
York City: Camden. New Jersey; 
and Wahington. D. C. According 
to attorney Melvin Wulf. ACLU 
lawyers have filed suits to re
strain Selective Service from tak
ing further "punitive action"'against draft delinquents. The suits 
contend that reclassification and 
induction is a form of punishment 
administered without due process 
of law bv an agency not consti
tutionally empowered to punish 
anyone.

Why an Alternative?

sibility. What is left is a student 
body full of people who are be
ing thoroughly indoctrinated in 
the belief that they cannot ac
complish anything. Of course, 
most believe that they cannot 
get what they want through any 
action on their part. This is 
your student apathy!
Toward this problem of student 
apathy, the newly formed Stu
dent Cooperative Organization 
for Responsibility in Education 
proposes a vital and energetic 
solution. The first step is the 
abolition of Student Govern
ment.
The method for accomplish
ing this is to be referendum ten
tatively scheduled for the end 
of this month. It is hoped that 
this referendum will provide a 
mandate for doing away with 
Student Government.
Though in theory Student 
Government is the active rep
resentative of the wishes and 
desires of the student body, the 
years have proven that the only 
function it serves on this cam
pus is to provide a marshy buf
fer zone. From one side this 
quagmire absorbs all desires of 
the student to have some effeot 
on his campus environment. On 
the other side, Student Govern
ment allows the administration
to indicate without any fear of 
student interference in campus 
operations. Because of this in
herited role, it is virtually im
possible for Student Govern
ment to achieve any degree of 
effectiveness on this campus.
The student may wonder what 
organization or structure will 
take the place of Student Gov
ernment. None will! (The rea
sons for this are explained by 
Gene Payne elsewhere in this 
issue.) What Score proposes is 
a student cooperative union com
prised of special interest groups.
The manner in which these 
groups will press their demands 
or desires to the administra
tion will be through the use of 
direct bargaining with the ad
ministration. On issues of major 
concern, Score feels that this 
campus is small enough to re
turn to Democracy. Major ideas 
which would effect the student 
body could be submitted to a 
referendum.
Following the above, wpioh 
has, then, a twofold purpose. 
First, wpioh will work to insure 
that the administration bargains 
fairly and honestly with the stu
dent body. Secondly, we hope 
to show the students that they 
can accomplish something 
through their o'vn responsible, 
actions.
Ft ,huh mCtuh 
',huh cr iuh ig nPh 0horiur cus
rnodehunCa cu curncndncuy wpioh 
iu vCe0dr:
Score, the Student Coopera
tive Organization for Respon
sibility in Education, is approx
imately one week old and is 
faced with its first dogmatic 
confrontation as to a theory of 
the student.
I shall not speak about 
Scores guiding principles here. 
In line with our main philoso
phy, you should be interested 
enough to find out for your
self.
I shall concern myself, in
stead, with answering the state
ment of Dale Peschel, Until a 
suitable alternative is present
ed, I feel a responsibilty to de
fend Student Government.
Mr. Peschel and I differ on 
one very basic issue. And that 
is the question of structured 
versus emergent student lead
ership. Mr. Peschels policy is 
that we must either reformu
late the structure of Student 
Government or else devise an 
alternative structure, and then 
choose the one that best serves 
the students needs.
It is my opinion that the fatal 
weakness of student govern
ments is one of structure and 
a devotion to the principle that 
there must first exist a given 
set of rules by which everybody 
will play the game and a min
ute enumeration of the roles 
each player must take, and that 
all of this must occur before 
any action can take place. While 
I do not consider myself to be 
an organizational theorist, I do 
know that under certain condi
tions leaderships and structures 
emerge to fulfill the perceived 
needs of any group. This is the 
situation that I feel will be pre
sent once Student Government 
has been abolished and no al
ternative structure has been in
stituted.
The student, whom I consider 
to be rational and working in 
his own best interest, will find 
that the absence of a student 
government gives him the op
portunity to confront the admin
istration directly on issues of 
his own vital concern. This 
would be much more efficient 
in that only those issues of vi
tal concern will be the ones to 
be considered.
As an example, take the ques
tion of a Spring Carnival or 
Homecoming. The overwhelm
ing majority of the students on 
this campus recognize that with 
or without their help or inter
est, every year at the appropri
ate time, there will occur a 
Spring Carnival and a Home
coming.
Suppose this were not the 
case. Suppose that there was 
no benevolent student govern
ment to undertake these pro
jects. (Or anything else, for 
that matter.)
It would then be incumbent 
upon the students interested in 
putting on a Spring Carnival 
or Homecoming to devise plans 
for funding.
Here, then, the primary is
sue is one of student responsi
bility. If there exist responsible 
students, then no lack of struc
ture will sway them or impede 
them in accomplishing their 
goals.
But what if, you might ask, 
no group of students comes 
forth and says they want to 
handle a Spring Carnival or 
Homecoming? While I view that 
possibility as being unrealistically remote, it is my opinion 
that if it occurred, there should 
be no Spring Carnival or Home
coming, or anything else, as this
is undoubtedly a Clear indica
tion of a lack of student inter
est on the subject.
Thus, we should arrive at a 
more involved, more interested, 
more responsible, and more ef
ficient student body for this uni
versity. Further, an educational 
goal will be attained in that it 
will be demonstrated to the stu
dent that he can accomplish so
ciety changes through confron
tation with the power structure. 
Armed with this attitude, the 
student may well go into the out
side world and do exactly the 
same things he has done here.
I have nothing more to say 
on the subject. Score is a via
ble alternative even though it 
offers no alternative structure 
in which to be bogged down.
The prime message is respon
sibility.
Where Do We
Ft ,Cot wnoCdrr
An important question, or 
what should be an important 
question to students these days 
is, Where do we stand? Un
der Dean Swanks theory, all 
student activities are games, 
models of real life situations 
with one important characteris
tic. They are always set up with 
a limit  a place where some 
wiser, older person will step in 
and prevent the students from 
being exposed to the responsi
bility of their actions. This pro
tection may seem wise to Dean 
Swank and the administration 
in their mood of benevolent in 
loco parentis, but to any stu
dent who cares to examine it, 
the game is the cause of, or the 
prime contributor to apathy on 
this campus. For all the lumped 
experience of our administra
tion, they do not seem to be in
formed of the simple fact which 
has been known since first start
ed to expand his horizons. A 
,Ceh id vCuuin Birh br Bhrr 
1PCu 3ionPahrrf bn br GCoegdaQ
And these games have harm
ed the students. Their sense of 
responsibility, like any other hu
man thing that is not used, has 
atrophied. A direct result has 
been the creation in the students 
of an almost flagrant irresponTheForFign dmeC Plcg ;1
campus, the necessity for an 
elected, representative, leader
ship is nonexistent, and the re
sult is ineffiicency and apathy.
Abolition of Student Govern
ment is considered the only 
method sufficiently significant 
to convince the total campus 
community of the complete 
change their role and responsibilties as students has under
gone.
Further, there exist many le
gislative technicalities which 
may halt any group of legisla
tors, no matter how well mean
ing, from accomplishing any 
truly significant change in a 
short period of time.
The normative expectations 
of an individual in Student Gov
ernment, says Gene Payne, one 
of the founders of wpioh are 
sufficienty strong so as to pre
clude the possibility of radical 
change. Lip service is paid by 
these individuals to their respec
tive constituencies but, for the 
most part, they find themselves 
rapidly internalized and fuction 
as subunits of the Administra
tion.
Score feels that Student Gov
ernment has not been represen
tative of the total student com
munity and does not express the 
interests of some very impor
tant minority groups on cam
pus, such as Fine Arts students, 
large numbers of commuters, 
and many people who consider 
themselves indf p< udents. 
Score would n-t represent 
these peoples ciests^ either. 
As Walt Sullivan of WRCT 
has put it, What has Student 
Government done for you? 
Nothing. What will Score do for 
you? Nothing. Score will let you 
do things for yourself.
The responsible student, doing 
things for himself, because no
body is going to do it for him, 
is the essence of this movement,

The Music of Lou Harrison 
And Earle Brown
bv Bernie Yannotta
The tenth annual Composers Forum commenced on Wendesday 
February 29th with the music of Lou Harrison. Mr. Harrison is from 
Portland. Oregon and does much of his work in the Pacific states. 
He stated in his introductory comments that the major influence 
on his music is his infatuation with the orient and particularly India. 
?vlr. Harrison, in fact, wears exclusively, sandals and other Indian foot
wear. He feels they are much more comfortable than the traditional 
western shoes  
The first piece on the program was a wdcnh gio mcCui performed 
bv Ralph Zitterbart. He is an extremely sensitive musician and played 
as well as he could bave considering the quality of the music. It was 
iust another twelve-tone piano piece of which there have been many 
written and. they all sound alike. The suite was no doubt influenced 
bv his early study with Arnold Schonberg. The vCuncpah .if 3 gio mhos
cussion followed the suite and it too was performed very admirabley 
by a percussion ensemble from out CMU music department. Its orien
tal flavor and intensive rhythm patterns made it a charming and in
teresting musical experience. Especially intriguing was the use of the 
ocarina. The ocarinist. Miss Patti Runk, was free to choose whatever 
melody she wished as long as it stayed within certain limitations set 
down by the composer. This work proved to be the most imaginative 
of the four heard.
The third piece was a Trio for Violin, Viola, and Cello. It was 
a short rather sentimental work in whcih rhythm did not seem to be the 
major part, as in the other three works but instead melody and harmony. 
Mr. Harrison stated in his introductory remarks that it is an intro
spective and personal piece of music. The program concluded with 
a viuphoni gio ladnh CuM mhopdrrciuf It was written as a birthday pre
sent for one of this teachers. Henry Cowell. The performers in this 
piece were even more free to choose whatever notes or percussion 
instruments they wanted to use. The music was written in such a way 
that only relative pitches in regards to highs and lows were indica
ted. The specific notes on the flute, for example, were left up to the 
flutist and the choice of drums and other percussion instruments 
left up to the percussionist. Mr. Harrison seemed to be opening up a 
new door to more of an instinctive impromptu music in which the com
poser guides the performer rather than commanding him.

For example in his 1ceh lc-h for fluet, trombone, harp, and violin, 
Mr. Brown conducted this quintet and cued the entrances and exits of 
the particular instruments. Besides this device he also employs the use 
of four channels of taped sound. The specific sounds on the tape rang
ed from human voices to instrumental music. This tape was inter
spersed with the live performance of the quintet. Mr. Brown also crea
ted music by indication that the flutist just presses and releases the 
keys without blowing air into the flute. The noise of the trombonist 
releasing air into the trombone was also music to Mr. Brown.
The program surged forward with 1Pohh mchphr gio mcCui of which 
the saving grace was their brevity. Like Mr. Harrisons suite, these too 
were just another twelve-tone row work. One interesting thing, how
ever. which Mr. Brown did was to indicate dymanic levels in such a 
way that they form a row or a serial.
Third in the nights entertainment was GiMiyoC0P D gio ladnh 
vhahrnoC CuM mhopdrrciuf In this Mr. Brown utilized again the brilliant 
technique of false notes on the flute. Somehow, I just cannot justify

Pittsburgh Paranoia 
Next Trips Festival
Tickets are now on sale for 
Pittsburghs second psychedelic 
Light Show and Dance, to be 
presented Sunday, March 24, at 
8 pm in the Skibo Ballroom. 
The Carnegie-Mellon Experimen
tal Film Group, sponsors of the 
LightShow, have billed their sec
ond Tips Festival as Pitts
burgh Paranoia, and expect a 
larger turnout than the near
record numbers who attended 
the first Light Show-Dance.
Because of the expected turn
out, admission price for stu
dents has been lowered from 
$2 to $1.50, and the Light Show 
and Dance is expected to con
tinue past the usual closing 
hour of midnight. At least three 
of Pittsburghs most psychedel
ic bands will be in attendance, 
two of iwhich the Young and 
Wild and the Plant, are being 
brought back because of the 
great stir created by their ap
pearance at the first Light 
Show.
One of the firsts in the tech
nical end of the Light Show is 
a new form of lighting, polariz
ed animated abstracts; it will be 
the first time this device has 
been employed in the United 
States. Instead of the usual 
three screens, five will be used, 
in an attempt to capture more 
fully the effect of "total environ
ment. Ten operators will be 
manning ten projectors, several 
Underground Films will be 
shown simultaneously, and addi
tional stroke lights focussed on 
the dancers should all contri
bute to an effect even more 
psychedelically involved than at 
the initial Light Show.
Tickets will be available in 
advance at the Skibo Reception 
Desk, or can be obtained at the 
door at show time.

TheForFign dmeC eFor 2)
I was very greatly disturbed 
by the facts of alienation as out
lined in a speech by Dr. Morgan 
transcribed in the TARTAN for 
March 13, *and, I believe, sum
marized some weeks earlier. He 
distinguished only two types of 
alienated individuals. I hope 
later on to show that the distinct
ion he markes between these two 
types is insufficient and person
ally insulting.
.. I do not take issue with this 
opening comments, for it is as 
obivous to me as it seems to him 
that a Civil Rights activists an 
angry young man. must necessar
ily be part of the society whose 
attitudes he is attempting to alter.
This type of alienated indivi
dual is therefore alienated in 
name, but not in fact. The rec
ognition of the social needs of 
others, and the determination that 
these needs should be satisfied 
demands of an individual ideal
ism and self-Sacrifice, but not self 
discovery. The Civil Rights by 
definition are those which should 
belong to everyone; and anyone 
who attempts to guarantee such 
rights to all men must conscien
tiously imply the abridgement of 
the rights of each individual.
There is, I admit, nothing nov
el in these views. Dr. Bob rates 
congratulations only on his deft 
paraphrases. And what follows 
in Dr. Morgen's speech is pro
bably also an accurate descrip
tion of individual who exists in 
our generation. The psycholog
ically alienated individual, 
cynical, cold-blooded and fatal
istic, sounds like a frat (or 
dorm) rat who can't make the 
grade. To him all that can pos
sibly be good in life (good educa
tion. good job. good society) has 
been removed forever beyond his 
grasp, and he retreats into his
selfish ego muttering, sour grap
es". Frustrated suburban ambi
tions are the single carse respon
sible for his alienation. He is 
therefore unambitious, unproduc
tive and. the Good Doctor seems 
to think, unfit to live.
Is is in self-defense, as an alien
ated individual, that I write this 
letter. Dr. Morgan has stupidly, 
by omission, stigmatized me and 
any others like me. Dr. Morgan 
has made a value judgement - 
has said that angry young men 
have positive signs of good 
mental health. and that all other 
alienated do not. The committ
ment of the angry young men is 
both the cause of and the evi
dence for their health, and the 
uncommitted have been denied 
their usefulness and their sanity. 
I am not normally an angry young 
man.and have never been one of 
Dr. Bob's health radicals, and I 
bitterly resent the expert impli
cation that I ah therefore psy
chologically disturbed. There is. 
I know, a third important cate
gory into which the alienatedmay fall. This is my category, 
and I assume there are others in 
it. But Dr. Morgan has mounted 
what I regard as a personal attack 
upon my way of life, and it is 
for myself, alone, that I frame 
this reply.
As an alienated individual. I 
feel no obligation to the other 
members of the society in which 
I live, except for those obligations 
imposed by that society: and I 
expect nothing from that society 
except for the rights which past 
experience has led me to antici
pate. I make exceptions for ac
quaintances. friends and relatives. 
I am involved with and committed 
to myself and to whatever work 
I feel I must do. to a degree that 
is probably surprising except to 
those with similar personal ob
ligations. My work contains no 
parallel or implied committment
to scoietv for. honestly. I have 
some doubts about the acceptance 
which society would give me. My 
relations to the systems around me 
are. largely, contractual: but I 
resent most strongly Dr. Morgan s 
implication that mv inner"life is 
cold and without meaning. An in
dividual alienated like myself 
feels most strongly for himself 
and his own personal develop
ment. I travel towards an un
known goal, certain only that I 
am still moving. I am aware of the 
flaws in the System, but don't 
really believe that my awareness 
forces upon my the obligation to 
correct or help to correct those 
flaws. I will not act to further 
a cause unless I am forced by 
events or by some draft" :nto 
action. The individual alienated 
like myself feels most strongly 
for himself, and thus becomes an 
Intellectual in the most restric
tive sense of the term. While I 
do not dislike (and find myself 
socially close to) my angry co
generation. I do not feel their 
militant impluse to right for soc
iety its wrongs. Ond does not 
have to become individual by ex
posing himself physically to the 
world around him. One can be
come an individual, an intellect
ual, through a process involving 
alienating oneself, by approach
ing the world with the mind as 
well as with body. The lack of 
showy committment does not al
ways indicate that an individual 
lacks beliefs. I am humanistic, op
timistic and. as proof of this, still 
alive. The allienated mind, alone 
and sometimes lonely, may or 
may not produce, but you may be 
sure that very little that he ex
periences is wasted upon him.
I believe I have said enough. 
Here is my letter, as an alienat
ed individual, as myself, to the 
editor. Some people might see in 
this letter a contradiction; I leave 
them to puzzle it out. The act of
alienation includes the withdraw
al from society and the slow dis
covery of oneself and of ones ability. There is. I believe, a cer
tain Quixotic modesty involved in 
the process. This is what aliena
tion has been for me. and I hope 
YOU don't judge insane.

In the student power talk 
presented last Monday by the

who desire the presidential pos

some content issues, rather 
than the form issues usually 
discussed. Form issues deal only 
with parliamentary procedure 
o with better communication 
between the students and stu

and throughout it he employs various other devises. The Flute again 
makes music by depressing the keys; the bass clarinetists instruction 
read at one part slap tongue against reed as hard as possible. The 
trumpeter blows air through his trumpet producing nothing but the 
airy breathing sound. The evening ended with much argumenta
tive discussion. Mr. Brown made it clear that he realizes all sounds in 
his music-making and all the sounds have a specific purpose.
Mr. Browns music is written for the broad-minded listener. If 
one is accustomed to Beethoven. Brahms,and Debussy then this mod
ern music will take some getting used to. This choice music has its 
place in the twentieth century along with twelve-tone row music and 
electronic music. However, Mr. Brown is neither an Arnold Schonberg 
nor a John Cage. He has many good ideas, but until the listening audi
ence hears more coherence in his ideas, he will remain relatively un
known and be classified as just another twentieth-century compser.

Letters...
tent issues represent real needs 
and wishes of the student body.
Unfortunately, none of you 
had the chance to answer Eds 
question. I would like to reask 
his question, and would like a 
public answer in the Tartan. 
Specifically, would each of you 
state to the student body what 
you feel that SG can and should 
do about the following and re
lated issues:
1) What can SG do about the 
outmoded in loco parentis rule 
of the administration? This rule 
enables an administration to of
fer a female student the option 
of expulsion or voluntary with
drawal as punishment for her 
choice to live with an off cam
pus male. Cant SG ask that 
each student be responsible for 
generating his or her own sex
ual or moral code? Isnt this 
a question that is totally isolated 
from one of academic life, and 
shouldnt the student be immune 
from academic reprimands for 
a moral choice?
2) Cant SG expand its rep
resentation to include graduate 
students on the campus? When 
one fourth of a student body is 
directly hurt by a Selective Ser
vice ruling, shouldnt SG be willto take a stand in their defense?
3) Cant SG take a stand 
which directly challenges the 
living conditions which exist in 
campus housing? Shouldnt SG 
discuss the rat- infestment of 
Henderson Dormitory, and di
rectly confront the administra
tion with a demand to rid the 
dorms of rats? Shouldnt SG 
request that the architects take 
pains to adequately soundproof 
the new fraternity housing?
4) Shouldnt SG examine the 
relation of our students to the 
off-campus world? Other cam
puses have had some of the SG 
funds allocated to off-campus 
tutoring projects. If an educated 
legislative body such as SG can
not devote some monies to such 
efforts, how can we expect our 
sometimes less well-educated 
Congress to take such actions? 
When an administrative official 
questions the use of school fa
cilities by outsiders (ie., Ne
groes and hippies,) should SG 
condone such an artificial withdrawel from the problems of the 
off-campus world?
5) How should SG respond to 
administrative requests for rati
fication of a document gener
ated by the administration, such 
as the recent statement on cam
pus demonstrations? Is such ac
tion really representative of the 
student body? How independent 
from the administration, and 
representative of student needs 
do you feel you can be?
6) When our governments 
policies directly interfere with 
student interests, cant SG take 
an official stand against such 
policies as representatives of 
the students? What should SG 
do in reply to Hiersheys Octo
ber manifesto denying the free
dom of expression of dissent 
with the draft systemor isnt 
this representative of our needs?
7) Can SG represent student 
opinion about curriculum needs. 
Specifically, do you feel that 
SG can communicate any stu
dent sentiment about the des
irability of the new curricula 
suggested in the proposal for 
the new college? Do students 
know enough about their aca
demic needs to make such sug
gestions?
I would like to see such ques
tions answered by each potential 
president of SG. The time to 
begin meaningful representation 
is now not when we leave school.
How do you propose to handle 
these and other content ques
tions, or must we content our
selves with more parliamentary 
form?
Yours,
George R. Madaras
All former residents 
of the Men's Dormitories 
are requested to claim 
any personal items still 
in storage.
After April 1, 1968 
all property not belonging

Dorm counselors may be 
contacted for assistance.
Grad Students Score
Graduate students who are tired 
of being considered as second 
class citizens of the university will 
find a chance to voice their opin
ions in the SCORE referendum 
to be conducted on March 28 and 
29.
Student Government excludes 
the graduate students body, which 
is rapidly approaching the size 
of the undergraduate student 
body.
In the SCORE referendum, 
graduate students will be asked 
to vote along with undergrad
uates. The vote tally of the grad
uate students will be kept sep
arately. and will be an indication 
of the graduates' desNe to come 
to grips with the administration 
as a special interest group.

Regatta Planned 
Hot Air Balloons
The first intercollegiate hot 
air balloon regatta is being plan
ned for late May, 1968. Competi
tion is for the MacArthur Tro
phy, a small crystal prism of 
Stueben Glass which is to be 
found submerged in a bowl of 
champagne when presented to 
the winning pilot.
Events of the regatta will be:
1. Distance race, a one hour 
flight below 2,000 feet;
2. Sport land contest, a half mile 
flight toward a target;
3. Balloon hurdles, half mile 
over simulated obstacles, and
4. Sky vault, a precision 100 foot 
ascent against time.
BaUooons for the first regatta
are to be suppled toy the Aeros
tats, the only hot air balloon 
school in the world, located now 
in Connecticut. Control of the 
ups and downs of the balloon 
is managed toy changing the 
temperature of the air within 
the balloon envelope, using an 
in-flight air heater which burns 
liquid propane carried with the 
balloon.
Most balloon flying takes place 
early in the morning or late in 
the afternoon when winds are 
generally lowest. Inflation of the 
balloon is accomplished by us
ing the in-flight burner tourntr 
to inject heated air into the 
horizontally deployed envelope. 
Inflation takes less than ten 
minutes and costs 'less than one 
dollar. As the balloon begin to 
tauttn the pilot yells out, Let 
go the Crown and the 'balloon 
swings upright. The pilot steps 
into the basket, adding more 
heat. Balloon takeoff is gentle, 
sure and stately; so gradual a 
process that a blindfolded pas
senger could not possibly tell 
when the machine is lifted.
