New Machines 
At Morewood
Automatic milk dispensers avd 
beverage coolers have been in
stalled in the Morewood Gardens 
^cafeteria. Though residents comOplain that the new milk machines 
limit milk capacity in theirglasses, 
the machines are actually helpful 
innovations. Unlike the handoperated lever machines, these 
are automatic push button types 
which include a tray rack. The 
$900 machines hold two five gal
lon cans and consist of a refrig
erator and pressure mechanism.
The lemonade-orange beverage 
coolers provide colder drinks than 
jthe previously distributed car-, 
tons of juice. Girls appreciate the 
additional refrigeration but com
plain that there are no longer any 
cartons of juice, -to take back to 
their rooms.

mor which had been circulating

his administrative duties and his 
numerous writing activities, Cor

fitting the bill as a teacher:
In the twenty-minute session, 
before introducing John Russell 
Brown, new head of the Depart
ment of Drama at.the University 
oi Birmingham in England,  Cor
rigan let it be known that he 
would concentrate his efforts on a

clude in a lame duck manner.

Evnod Means Future Farce; 
Boy Resists Girl For Computer
Evnod"
Evnod?
Yeah, Evnod. No, its not a pill, its not a CIA code, its 
not a key club password. A select few know that Evnod is 
the code for a computer routine used in the Computer Center. 
Il's now something more  a# 
new musical which Scotch *n |
Soda will produce this year.
Modern musicals tend to deal 
wilh deep social problems. In 
keeping with the trend, Dave 
Hildebrand, the author of this 
^.years SnS show (and a mathema
tician himself) deals with such 
deathless questions as:
Can Brian find True Happiness 
with his punch cards? Will Katie 
succeed in leading him from his 
Good Life amidst the magnetic 
tapes?
Will the machine finally en
slave the multitudes of slow^ fitted men?
What the devil in an Evnod?
The show is called a future 
force. The farce refers to the 
type, not the quality, of the show. 
II opens the week before Spring 
Carnival, with a salute to Prog
ress, Young Love, Old Love, High 
Finance, the American 'Way of 
Life, and Evnod. Oh yeah  
Evnod. It's a machine.

This presentation by Governor

other member countries to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade begin their tariff cutting 
negotiations in Geneva. His sub

Kennedy Round.
As a part of the Chambers 
Host-A-Student program, an in

this topic, is extended to hear 
Governor Herter spealc. The stu
dents are not expected to' have 
lunch. They should assemble by 
12:50 on the Ballroom foyer, out

will then be escorted to their seats 
at the rear of the Ballroom to'hear

mentum Transfer is two railroad 
trains of fluids, going at different 
speeds in the same* direction on 
two parallel tracks. When a little 
fluid jumps from the faster train 
to the slower, the slower train 
speeds up. The Chem Es figure 
out exactly how much it speeds 
up.
Seniors take a special match 
course and an eight hour per week 
lab, where they actually begin 
some of these processes; it is call-, 
ed Unit Operations Lab and here 
they work on new designs for ma
chinery, such as distillation vats to 
prepare chemicals. They stir dif
ferent fluids, comparing the 
amount of work it takes to stir 
them with how viscous they are. 
There are even some that get 
thicker as you stir (egg whites do 
this) or get thinner; they have 
wonderful words like thizatropic 
to apply to them and how does one 
find a preservative which will not 
affect the taste of ketchup?

stated simply; Will a hot cup of 
coffee cool faster if cream is added 
at once and then allowed to cool, 
or should the cooling process be 
first, with the cream added later?* 
Thats knowledge for living!
Once in industry, seniors branch 
oiit; not only do they design re
actors, evaporators, and distillation 
columns, for the preparation of 
chemical substances  like all the 
different grades of gasoline that 
Sunoco has (190* 200,. 210 ,etc.) for 
different purposes, but they study 
how to best shove toothpaste into 
a pipe( this is quite a problem in 
industry, believe it or not, and 
they work on the chemical struc
tures of new synthetic fibers.
Most Chem Es dont like 
cookbook recipes; stir in a cup 
of hydrocarbons has little appeal 
to them, and they would prefer 
more concentration on engineering 
courses in the department. They 
are not permitted until their senior 
year to really specialize and do 
independent I'esearch. The depart
ment, however, is recognized as 
one of the top in the country.

Your Man 
In Congress
By MIRIAM GILLESPIE
In Wednesdays Committee Heads meeting, Congress 
Chairman Tom Pyke read a letter he received from President 
Johnson asking the Tech student body to contribute to the 
John F. Kennedy Memorial Library Fund. One objection 
to this fund would be its possible interference with the 
Campus Chest drive. Students will have an opportunity to 
discuss this suggestion and vote on it at todays Congress meeting.
The point system for activities keys is still being revised. 
The committee, heads discussed whether Kiltie Band mem
bers should, receive points since most members also receive 
academic credit for their participation. Another objection  
raised was whether seniors should continue to receive ten 
points for merely being seniors.
The proposal to make buying the Thistle compulsory 
for all seniors, along with an amendment to change Fall 
Festival to Homecoming, will again be discussed at todays 
Congress meeting.
Candle in the Darkness

Cultural Standards
. __________________________
It has been early universally accepted in this country 
that opera is better than rock-and-roll, westerns should 
not dominate television at the expense of more high-brow 
programs, etc. That is, while a person may personally pre
fer westerns, he admits that some minority has the right to 
adjust programming to his disadvantage.
Whis is this? Because both the cultured and the 
clods have agreed on standards of what is good and what 
is bad. If a person does not like what is good, he should 
still acquiesce in the furthering of a minoritys interests if 
they are better.
Yet, does not the man watching a western have as 
equally a pleasurable experience as the man watching a 
better show? 'Or is the man who has. higher tastes an 
innately : better (more important) person? (Sic) Such a 
theory is in direct opposition to the idea of democracy as 
it is practiced here  before, the law all men are equal. The 
choosing of television programming is one irea where ma
jority rule is reasonable (Sic) contrary to the usual tone 
of this column. Why? In either case some persons are not 
going to get to see what they want. The question is which 
group will be satisfied  the masses, or the cultured 
minority. When such a decision must be made, the greatest 
good for the greatest number is the proper criterion. Any 
other criterion would implicitly assume that some men are 
capable of greater pleasure than others.. Plato would say 
this, but are the proponents of cultural direction of the 
majority willing to?
If high-brow programs are better than westerns etc., 
then their proponents should not fear the different cultural 
standards competing since in time, as. men become more 
educated, tastes will change and the better will win. It is 
not a question of excluding any culture; each type would 
get time in the arena of life in proportion to the numbers 
of its proponents. (Actually in proportion to the money its 
proponents have  which is a bias in favor of a high-brow 
culture.)
The establishment of a national cultural center has 
been proposed. This organization would support .activities 
that cannot get sufficient funds from the public freely. In 
this case everyone would be forced to pay since funds 
would be raised by taxation. Such an idea (and many 
others in the same (sic) vein) may be desirable. Personally, 
I. like them.) However, the establishment of official cul
tural standards is not in the spirit, of democracy. Perhaps 
a majority would agree that the best culture should be 
furthered. But this could be because they have been brain
washed into thinking their opinions are not, and should 
not be, worth as much in the governments eyes as others. 
If a matter is the legitimate concern of government, then 
the majority should rule. Any other criterion leads even
tually to a tyranny, even if a benevolent one, of a: minority 
over a majority.

Enter Hungry
by Leslie Budunan 
La Mont, a georgeous semi-Baroque restaurant atop 
Mount Washington, is unofficially the most elegant eating 
place in Pittsburgh. It seems unable to decide upon an 
architectural style; the stucco exterior with Spanish grillwork is small preparation for the wiidly extravagant pinkand-gold interior. The tables next^------------^:------------------ -------;*
to the floor-to-eeiling windows
overlooking th point (remember 
that?) are most in demand. A 
rather exuberant piano player, 
who also sings, resides with his 
piano in the cocktail lounge, just 
slightly below the restaurant 
area.
The food is excellent, but this 
has.to be an expense account job 
unless the date is very special. 
Without drinks, two people can 
keep th bill under '$15 by trying 
hard, but its more fun to let your
self go. After 10:30 p.m.p they 
dont seem to mind serving only 
a huge salad with shrimp or escar
gots, or even tea and parfaits; The 
sheer glory of the place is worth 
it, even worth the 2 streetcars 
(downtown and Grant St.  
Mount Washington) or streetcar 
and Duquesne Incline (5c) if 
you havent a car.
The specialities, naturally, are 
French, the best of which is squab 
stuffed with wild rice; everythinjg
is served incomparably, with a 
style upequalled in'Pittsburgh.
. Meadow Grill .is a real dive, in
side and out, where one can buy 
the best pizza in the city, in 
Pittsburghs Little-Italy (which 
is also the name of the restaurant 
itself), it nestles on the corner of 
Meadow and Larimer; if you plan 
to go, take- n 88 Frankstown 
streetcar at Fifth and Mrwoptd 
and get off at Larimer, turn left 
and walk, dont run, the three re
maining blocks. It might help to 
take a friend - in fact, take sev
eral.
Onqe in this strange place,, with 
beautifully panelled booths and a 
1930s mural of Italy all around 
the upper half of the walls, the 
atmosphere takes over. A huge TV 
blares over the bar but the food
 all very Italian  includes all 
varieties of Italy  aritipasto, 
spaghetti, ravioli, and the incom
parable pizza, in any size and
variety, is a. meal in itself. The 
sausage is hot and the crust is 
puffy * not Betos cardboard, and 
the cheese makes little strings 
from your mouth to. your hand, 
down your arm, and onto .yoiir lap,  
so yon know its really Italian. The 
salads are powerful, and the 
neighborhood is rough  in short, 
you need a stomach as strong as 
your nerve to go there at all, but 
itls worth it
Weinsteins, practically a land 
mark of Pittsburgh, and defintely 
a landmark of Squirrel Hill, is a 
restaurant which features th 
favorites of the old-style Jewish 
cooking. Of course, you dont , have 
to be Jewish to go there; Wein
stein fans include anyone and ev
eryone who enjoys good food. The 
menu includes everything from 
dinners, seafood to roast beef, to 
salads and other delicacies like 
Kishka (i.e. stuffed derma); or 
even bagles, laux and cream 
cheese for the New Yorkers in the 
audience.-The atmosphere is live
ly and friendly, the service is good 
and the bills aren't too high.: Some 
people even say the place looks 
like a restoration tavern, but that 
is rather doubtful. Anyway, that's 
up. to you. If you prefer eating at 
home, Weinsteins can still accom
modate you. In the front of the 
store you will notice a dlicates 
sen and-bakery bar.

SNCC Freedom Singers Entertain 
For Carnegie Tech Liberal Club
Freedom singers perform in Highlander room,
The Freedom Singers, a civil rights group, performed at 
Carnegie Tech, last Thursday, March 4. The performance in
spired the members at the meeting of the Students for 
Liberal Thought and Action." The vocalist group has been 
singing freedom movement songs around the country.
The meeting was originally^
scheduled to feature Mr. John 
Lewis, National Chairman of the 
Student Non-Violent Coordinat
ing Committee (SNCC). SNCC 
conducts many voter registration 
drives and sit-ins in the South. 
However, in step with a procedure 
which has now become de regie 
in Southern Courts, Mr. Lewis 
received a subponae by a Nash
ville judge at 7 p.m. to appear in 
court fifteen hours later. As a re
sult, Mr. Lewis could not speak at 
the meeting, but rather had to 
defend himself in court. In place 
of Mr. Lewis, the Liberal Club 
presented the Freedom Singers 
from Philadelphia.
In addition to performing many 
of the songs they are noted for, 
the Freedom Singers told the 
group about their experience with 
injustice and bitterness in the 
South. Mathew Jones, their main 
spokesman, explained that the 
voter registration drives in the 
South have had limited success
because of the great economic re
prisals against Negroes who regis
ter. He also made comments on 
the press coverage the drives are 
receiving, the cailbre of the FBI, 
current civil rights legislation, and 
the Senate debates which he com
pared to a Ku Klux Klan meet
ing.
The singers explained that 
SNCC is now trying to recruit
1,000 college students to go into 
the South this summer to work in 
a number of Freedom Schools. 
These schools are designed to edu
cate the public in the social and 
political rights of the Negro, as 
Well as train new leaders for the 
Civil Rights Movement. Especially 
needed are students with back
grounds in sociology, political sci
ence, and community relation.
Those who are interested should 
keep in mind Mr. Jones sobering 
declaration: There are no two 
ways about it, someone is going 
to die there this summer. Someone 
is.going to die.

25 and the Betas nipped KS B 
25-22.
It was a black week for ATO 
in the Celtic League. They were 
defeated by the Grad Physics 36-
30 and the Finks B 44-31. The 
Grad game was a rough one, with 
ATO running out of a split T- and 
the Grads a single wing. The 
backjudge was very liberal with 
his calls for clipping and holding 
and the big Grads simply over
powered the Taus. The Finks had 
anca.sier time of it. They ran up 
a quick 10-2 lead and then held 
on for the rest of the game. These 
two games put the Grads first 
place in the league and set up a 
three-way second place tie be
tween ATO, Kappa Sig, and the 
Finks.
Kappa Sig edged PKT 29-27 in 
spite of Larry Langs 15 and the 
Grad Physics easily handled the 
Dunkers 43-27 in other important 
games played.
The Dunkers lost another one 
to the Commuters 46-43 who also 
took BTP MBM 47-26. The Phi 
Kaps also took the Betas 41-36.
With the playoffs approaching, 
the big Grad Eagles look more 
and more like the team to beat, 
it DU, the Dorm Trojans, and 
few other teams may have a 
things to say about that.
Rifle Team 
Gains Ground 
On NRA Match
Coach Murphys rifle team has 
continued to improve as time for 
the NRA Intercollegiate Sectional 
Rifle Matches grows closer. The 
Tartan sharpshooters shot a 1398, 
their highest score of the season, 
while defeating a very weak Cal
ifornia team 1398-1292.
The big man for Carnegie Tech 
was Captain Joe Schlitt who shot 
his highest score of the year, a 
96-97-94287. Senior Phil Mey
ers followed closely with a 285 
and after the first two relays, it 
looked as if Carnegie would break 
1400 for the first time this season. 
But the best the rest of the team 
could do were a 280 by Mike 
Knepley, a 274 by Bob Fritz, and 
a 273 by freshman Jim Burdick.

Won By Betas
Beta Theta Pi built up a big 
first round lead to take the intra

ship away from last year's trophy 
winner, Alpha Tau Omega.

dropped down to 187, but Sigma 
Nu was unable to overcome the 
14 point first-day bulge of the 
Betas.

jans both dropped their foul pro
duction by four and finished third 
and fourth respectively.

was 389 out of 500, Sigma Nu had 
380 the Grads finished at 358, and 
the Dorm Trojans with 350. ATO

Trackmen Gain New Coach; 
Prospects Bright Despite Losses
by Ron DeFeo
On Monday, March 2, the. Carnegie Tech trackmen had 
their first workout. The Tartan thinclads started their new 
season, as usual, with a new head coach (four coaches in the 
last four years). This is not to say anything about the quality 
of the coaches. With the aid of the veteran track, coach, Carl
Olsn, Mr. Crtsley was able to*- ~ ---------------the broad jump. In the two-mile 
run lanky Tom Bednarz of three 
years* experience is looking for 
his best year. While in the mile, 
scrappy, sophomore Chris Macosko, beaten only twice last year, 
is going to be pushed by the fleet 
freshman Harry Burkholdef, of 
cross country fame. Macosko 
and Andy Niedra team up to 
make life in the % mile rugged. 
Niedra, co-captain of last year, 
with a near record of under 
50 seconds in the ' mile, will 
make coach Varhos 440 worries 
dwindle. . Tough Joe Thomas, 
who says the newly initiated 330 
intermediate hurdles is his meat, 
Will be going all out in his last 
Tech track season. This leaves 
the sprints (100 and 220). A 
definite hole becomes quitea pparent htre. With' Hank Werronen, infrequent sprinted of last 
year, the Tartans have only the 
sophomore letterman of little note 
last year, Ron De Feo;
Anyone, especially freshmen, in
terested in furthering or starl
ing a career in the international 
sport of track. Do not be bash
ful. There is room for you. Re
port to the athletic office in the 
gym where you will be treated 
with kindness and filled in oil 
the details. . .
cofe up with another fin coach. 
He is Edward Vamos of Home
stead, Pennsylvania. Coach Vamos 
graduated from Pitt in 1961. Since 
then he has found employment 
with the Jones & Lockland Cor
poration. To this job he now adds 
the duties of track coach. While 
at Pitt, Vamos was a broad 
jumper on the Panther team. His 
first year he was tutored by the 
then Pitt coach Olson, thus- his 
qualifications for future coaching 
came to the eyes of Mr. Olson.
New Coach 
The new coach says he plans 
to continue in the practice of 
posting individual workouts if 
the team shows some sign otf 
being in shape. He is hopeful 
of at least equaling last years 
record of 8 and 2.
Coach Vamos should have a 
good chance of realizing his hopes. 
WKile the team suffered losses 
through graduation, the remain
ing lettermen and . upcoming 
freshmen should prove to form a 
formidable foe on the cinders. 
Dennis Gary, last yearls most val
uable player, and Mike Camp
bell, the sparkling distance man, 
are the two most heavily felt 
graduation losses. But among the 
returning lettermn there are 
many bright  spots.
Veterans Return 
Tony Williams will be back to 
see if he can break his own 
record in the pole vault. The up
coming discus field is led by de
pendable Hank Werronen, co-captain in 63 who also took a leg of 
the mile relay. Brawny Jon Borofsky with consistently long 
throws, heads up the shot put
ters. Bob (over 23 feet) Diskin
