College Concert Hall Swank Discusses
ToRepresentStudents
Students from the music de
partments of Pittsburghs five 
colleges will present a weekly 
program on WYDD-FM begin
ning Saturday, March 9, from 1 
to 3 pm.
WYDD-FM has invited students 
of the music departments at 
Duquesne, Pitt, and CarnegieMellon Universities and Chat
ham and Mount Mercy Colleges 
to form a musical quintet to 
produce College Concert Hall. 
Students from the five schools 
plus the deans of the music de
partments met with program 
manager Babette Doniger Mandell to organize the Saturday af
ternoon showcases. Each school 
was asked to choose one to 
three students to program the 
1-5 pm College Concert Ha'll. 
They will write and narrate in
troduction, intermission pro
gramming and closing as well 
as spinning the recordings they 
select for their programs. Any
thing from Elegies to Electronic 
music can be programmed by 
the producers. Their personal 
preferences are their only 
guides. They will work with the 
WYDD-FM staff in the produc
tion of the programs, but the 
editorial content will be solely 
of their own choosing.
These articulate and attrac
tive young people will talk about 
their tastes and talents in mu
sic. This new program opens up

Deathwatch, Prison 
Drama, Mar. 20th
The Camegie-Mellon Experi
mental Film Group will present 
its second program of Under
ground feature films on Wednes
day, March 20, in the Skibo 
Ballroom. Heading the program 
will be Jean Genets great pris
on drama, legncrgntcH The 
story of three hardened crimin
als whose inner turmoils lead 
them to destroy each other, 
Deathwatch has been acclaimed 
as one of the most penetrating 
prison studies of all time.
A counterpart to Genets ban
ned acgSn lwkDisuT legncR 
watch stars Leonard Nimoy in 
the role of Le Franc. Currently 
one of televisions hottest prop
erties, as the pointed-eared costar of Star Trek, Nimoy re
veals in legncrgntc a side of 
his acting talents hitherto un
suspected. The influential Film 
Quarterly called Nimoys per
formance pure Genet, and 
lauded him for the apprehen
sion of epic evil that was in
herent in his every look. The 
San pugStdfti acuiSdtmeT in a 
rare venture into critical re
view of Underground Films, 
commented that The struggle 
of these three, rebounding from 
the hostile to the lonely to the 
cruel is constantly electrifying, 
as is the miasma of homosex
uality that permeates the sor
did, dirty cell.
Deathwatch will be presented 
on Wednesday, March 20, at 7,
9. and 11 pm in the Skibo Ball
room.

ternity and sorority system will

Poet Lowell Topic 
Of OKeefe Lecture
h PeSSdbeu ldh
Last Thursday, Richard OKee
fe delivered the final lecture of 
the English Departments series 
Significant Literary Figures of 
the 20th Century. Now in his 
third year at C-MU, Mr. OKeefe 
did his undergraduate work at 
Duquesne University, received 
his M.A. from Penn State, and 
has done graduate work at 
Northwestern. Before coming to 
Carnegie, he taught at Loyola. 
Besides conducting classes here 
in Writing, Professional Writing, 
in World Literature, Modern 
Poetry, and Creative Writing, 
Mr. OKeefe is himself a na
tionally-published poet.

After converting to Roman 
Catholicism, Lowell married a 
novelist, Jean Stafford. Wheri 
drafted during World War II, he 
declared himself a conscdentous 
objector. He was tried as a 
draft dodger and spent five 
months in jail.
Lowells first work was Land 
of Unlikeness. The best of this 
volume was later reprinted in 
another work, Lord Wearys 
Castle. During this period Low
ell was divorced, rejected Ca
tholicism, and suffered several 
nervous breakdowns. In 1951, 
The Mills of the Kavanaughs 
appeared, a collection of seven 
poems which revealed Lowells 
skill but were somewhat unnat
ural. Later works were Life 
Studies, which OKeefe called 
Lowells masterpiece, Imita
tions, For the Union Dead, 
and Near the Ocean.
From these, OKeefe chose 
Lord Wearys Castle and Life 
Studies as dual focal points in 
his talk, reading gSy analyzing 
several poems gSy describing 
the evolution of 1iremmwf style. 
Despite the apparent maturation 
of this style, OKeefe stressed 
a basic continuity within the 
change.
Later works showed a greated 
flexibility, a loosening of meter 
and the abandonment of religi
ous themes.
OKeefe read and then para
phrased two poems: Christmas 
Eve Under Hookers Statue, 
an early work which called for 
a Christian return to peace and 
Skunk Hour, a poetic portrait 
of physical and sexual decay. 
Between these two poems, the 
thematic transition reflects the 
personal changes changes in 
Lowells life.
OKeefe described Robert Low
ell as a first rate poet, a writ
er of real verse, a poet who 
tried to redeem the world by 
his writing. His great strength 
lies in his ability to elevate the 
plain facts of our everyday exis
tence to poetic values.

Alienation has been a popular 
word in our culture for the last 
several years, but it is so new 
that it has not been well de
fined. I want to distinguish be
tween the alienated individual 
who is angry and the alienated 
individual who is psychological
ly apathetic.
There are a great many angry 
young men in 1968. They see 
various weaknesses in our so
ciety and react to them. They 
see institutions of which they 
do not approve. They see the 
church as a social rather than 
a religious institution and as 
one which ministers to people 
on Sunday but does little to in
fluence their lives during the 
rest of the week. They see it 
refusing to follow the logical 
implications of the theology they 
espouse. They see the institu
tion of the home failing to proUgly Man Contest 
Needs You
Every year on Techs campus 
and on campuses all over the 
country, Alpha Phi Omega chap
ters sponsor a unique service 
project  the Ugliest Man on 
Campus contest. Instead of de
termining which girl is the pret
tiest on campus, this selection 
will decide the ugliest male 
Anyone possessing the follow
ing three qualifications is eligi
ble to enter UMOC: he must be 
a male; he must be a C-MU stu
dent; and he must be ugly. To 
preserve some degree of com
petition, faculty members have 
been declared ineligible.
Any student organization wish
ing to enter a candidate must 
submit its name to: UMOC, Lar
ry Anderson, PHA, campus mail, 
before March 31. If you cant 
seem to find an ugly member 
in your organization, why not 
look in the mirror? Then talk 
one of your friends into run
ning before he realizes that you 
would make the best choice.
Ballot box stuffing will be en
couraged. Everyone will be per
mitted to vote as often as he 
wishes at the cost of one cent 
per vote. This makes it possible 
for those who are always at 
their wits end determining whom 
to vote for in the numerous 
queen elections to split their 
votes. The proceeds wall be giv
en to Campus Chest to be distri
buted to worthy charities. A large 
number of candidates strongly 
supported by their sponsoring 
organizations will result in an 
enthusiastic and generous sup 
port by the voters.
The Ugly winner will be an
nounced at Spring Carnival 
dance on May 4. In recognition 
of his unusual natural gift he 
will be awarded the traditional 
Ugly Mug. When filled to its 
capacity, this mug is capable of 
toasting the Ugliest Man on 
Campus for the entire evening.
vide a sound development back 
ground for the youth of ou 
day. They see the school failing 
to provide a good education am 
even fostering a kind of con 
formity among all students. 3 
have even students at Carnegie 
Mellon University who are angrj 
at the administration or whc 
lash out at the impersonal waj 
they are treated by faculty mem 
bers who are too busy with oth 
er activities. They gee a wai 
machine which uses up oui 
wealth, our attention, and om 
energy in a direction of which 
they do not approve at a time 
when other problems are cry
ing for solution.
The alienated indivdual who is 
angry see attitudes in our cul
ture which he objects to. He 
sees privilege for the wealthy 
in our universities and in our 
courts. He sees a kind of slave 
mentality that influences the 
way in which many of the white 
majority treat the Negro min
ority, and he also sees a kind 
of slave mentality in the defer
ence which many Negroes give 
to whites. He sees then a racist 
nation which he doesnt like. He 
sees war as an instrument of 
national policy just at a point 
when we are beginning to sense 
that war never does bring about 
the kind of positive change we 
want in the international situation.
The angry young men also 
see many individuals in our cul
ture who are much too sure that 
they know what is right for 
everyone. They see a great many 
people saying, "We are right, 
and you are wrong. They are 
sure that the government is 
right and the critics are wrong; 
the church is right and those 
who complain are wrong; pur
ity is right and any kind of 
pleasure or gratification is 
wrong; the old morals are right 
and the new morals are wrong.
These indivduals are angry, 
but they are not really alienated. 
Their society is so important to 
them that want to change it. 
They may be the angry young 
men and they may write novels 
or engage in demonstration and 
protests, but all of this is to the 
one end of improving society. 
Society is worth changing and 
society can change. The angry 
young men are committed to 
a cause and are involved in an 
activity which means a great 
deal to them. In many ways 
these are the indivduals with 
the most positive signs of good 
mental health.
The individual who is alien
ated psychologically is quite 
different. He knows that every
thing is meaningless. There is 
nothing which is true, nothing 
which is important, nothing 
which is useful, and nothing 
which is interesting. He is not 
involved in anything nor committedto any activity or line oi 
endeavor. He feeds extremely 
apathetic with no strong emo
tion which he can focus in any 
direction. If he does anything 
at all, he is bored with it His 
activity level is low for he would

Letters to 
the Editor
Editor, The Tartan:
I would like to extend my 
heartiest congradulations (sic) 
to you. Your service to human
ity has been imense (sic)! Long 
has the world awaited a sure
fire cure for insomnia!
The blaring blandness that 
blasts from the pulpy pages of 
your paper is unequaled (sic) 
the world over in sheer insignifi
cance. For example, consider the 
front page of your most recent 
issue. Our eyes are assaulted 
by the lead article concerning 
Student Government. Arent you 
aware that there is no such 
thing? Oh, there is a group, no 
doubt, made of cottage cheese, 
spouting Roberts Rules at each 
other and boring everyone with 
unsatisfactory suggestions to 
improve incipid (sic) buildings, 
incipid (sic) calenders and dull, 
depressing, worthless student 
activities such as the Tartan). 
They couldnt possibly exist!
Then on the second page the 
weary eyes in the nodding head 
of the reader are assaulted by 
the editorial. An attempt at wit! 
Ah, a witty editorwitless ere 
his editorial! A sanctamonius 
collection of nonsense from the 
Teachers Strike to the Pitts
burgh Press, penned in tid-bit 
gcssip column style.
From the cimmbling waste
land of the editorial, a glance 
to the right reveals the Letters 
tc the Editor section; a collec
tion of communications penned 
Su seemingly tapioca spined 
thinkers.
Three pages of solid advertis
ing follow, then we are disturb
ed to read about the terrible 
Teachers Strike. We are in
formed of the details we learn
ed several days before through 
the daily news media. The Tar
tan, here, seems to try to show 
us it knows as much (almost) 
about current events as we do.
The choice material, though 
lies ahead! Reviews, reviews and 
more reviews! No doubt, this 
summer theyll review the riots, 
led by Tony Lawrence (who 
has the great distinction of be
ing the only staff member less 
funny than the editor).
What can be done to save a 
paper with the personality of 
a cold potato knish? It can in
volve itself emotionally as well 
as intellectually in those prob
lems close to the students. Those 
problems that make students 
wear and pull their hair. The 
editorials should neither resem
ble the half-witted babblings of 
an imbecil (sic) nor the garbled 
mumbo-jumbo of an administra
tive intellectual. The paper in 
short should be alive.
This could be accomplished 
by placing the whited sepelehurs 
who run the paper back in their 
sarcophagi and nailing the lid 
shut. Then one could populate 
the organization with writers 
who, though they may seem a 
bit radical, would not be afraid 
to say, Damn you! Stop this 
insanity!

P.S.: The sports department 
has been well run and deserves 
praise.
Observations in Journal Contradict

Even in Latin America, acti
vists are in a minority, often 
very small, Seymour Martin 
Lipsit, author and professor of 
government at Harvard Univer
sity, writes in an introductory es
say. In nv>st countries the vast 
majority of students are a poli
tical, and tend to endorse the 
moderate or even the conserva
tive parties.
Other observations in the jour
nal contradict stereotyped ideas 
about students.
? Though students may pro
voke political action, they sel
dom bring it to fruition; the 
support of other groups is man
datory if any real change is to 
take place. Those political par
ties which do not repudiate stu
dent efforts are most liable to 
benefit from them; many par
ties which once relied heavily 
on student support, including 
the British Labor Party and of
ficial Communist parties, now 
tend to ignore student views.
? Student activism varies sig
nificantly according to discipline. 
Those disciplines that are 
thought of as Intellectualthe 
humanities and most of the so
cial sciencesare more activist 
and leftist than those that are 
oriented toward the profession
al or scientific world, Lipsit 
writes. This relationship also va
ries, however, from country to 
country: Medicine has a left
ist aura in various Latin coun
tries in the Americas and Eur
ope, but is traditionally quite 
conservative in most of north
ern Europe and the Anglophonic world.
Where cenomics is taught as 
an extremely technical, mathe
matically based subject, those 
who concentrate in the field are 
less radical than where it re
mains concerned with qualita
tive and historicail institutional 
analysis. ... In every disci
pline those who think of them
selves as intellectuals rather 
than professionals are more po
litically activist.
? University systems with de
manding class and academic 
schedules allow for less unrest 
than those depending primari
ly upon examinations. The ex
amination system used is a key 
factor, Lipset states. In the 
United States, too much extra
curricular activity often jeopar
dizes academic work; in Latin
America, where examinations 
are not so important or may 
be postponed, students are free 
for political action.
? Parents political attitudes 
show a high correlation with 
the politics of their children and'^ 
are a determining factor. Chil
dren of poorer families tend to 
be less active politically because 
they are strongly oriented to
ward upward mobility . . . con
centrated on careerist profes
sional objectives, and need to 
work as well as study. Social 
status seems more important 
than economic class background 
in affecting propensity for ac
tion.
? Student unrest is greatest 
when the society is changing 
rapidly or is felt to be back
wards. The student feels alien
ated from traditional values and 
finds either that his education 
is not relevant to the new situa
tion or that the society cannot 
offer him a professional career^ 
when he is graduated.
"Confrontation politics is char
acteristic of politics in which 
students, and other groups as 
well, lack legitimate channels 
of communication to authority.
? This factor can also affect 
rightist behavior, as is evi
denced by contemporary groups 
in several countries and, most^ 
dramatically, by German youth 
in the thirties. Rightist stu
dents were nationalistic, anti
authority, and concerned with 
the seeming inferiority of their 
nation within the world com
munity.
?In many countries, local uni
versity issues  housing, tuition, foodare the only ones* 
which can evoke mass protest. 
When this sentiment can be 
linked  often deliberately by 
student leaders from major par
ty groups  with national is
sues, a vigorous protest move
ment oan result, only to die 
when local demands are met or 
disappear.
Conservative, preoccupied with J 
career and other immediate con
cerns, most students are far 
from being fiery radical intent 
on bettering the lot of man
kind. Students and Politics do
cuments these conclutions with 
a series of studies of students 
in many different countries in 
the world.

Oakland is one of the most

areas of luxury apartments, lowpriced federal housing and very 
old family dwellings. The col
legiate population is very high 
as is the youth population, es
pecially in the low income and 
underdeveloped areas.
A few organizations have tried 
to present programs for the de
velopment and enjoyment of the 
youth. Most of the problems en
countered lie in the lack of con
cerned adult leadership. Two 
programs which are in vital 
need of adult leadership are the 
Boy Scouts for boys ages 11 
through 16 and the teenage 
youth program for ages 12 
through 14 and 15 through 19. 
Both programs are financed by 
a combined effort of six organ
izations. The organizations have 
the finances but do not have 
the adult to organize and carrycut the programs. Here is an 
ideal opportunity for all of us 
to work in the community and 
help develop the youth.
The Boy Scouts program needs 
men to work with the boys as 
the boys try to develop and car
ry out their programs. Adults 
are also needed to supply trans
portation to special events. Plan
ning Committees need men to 
help plan activities. There are 
lots of opportunities to work in 
this program. Unfortunately in 
the past two years, five units

cause of lack of adult leader
ship and none have been added.
The teen-age youth programs 
are in progress all around Oak
land. All programs are staffed 
by volunteers and financed by a 
pool of organizations. Several 
of the programs in the South 
Oakland area have had to close 
because of the lack of adult 
leadership and lack of space to 
hold the youth involved in the 
programs.
I believe that we have the 
unique opportunity to help the 
youth of the area. These youth 
have not had too much to look 
forward to in the past. The 
youth have asked for the pro
grams and we have had no 
adults to work with them. Stu
dent help is needed to help to 
develop the abilities of the youth 
in our community. Contact Ed

Soulages Exhibit 
At Museum Of Art
March 5, Pittsburgh, Pa.: A 
one-man exhibition, Pierre Soul
ages: Paintings Since 1963, will 
be presented by the Museum of 
Art, Carnegie Institute, from 
March 7 through April 7. The 
show will consist of 20 paint
ings, one of which, 24 Novem
ber 63, won the Carnegie In
stitute Award in the 1964 Pitts
burgh International and is in 
the Museum of Arts collection.
Soulages, who was bom in 
southern France in 1919, is fam
iliar to those who have seen 
his work in every Pittsburgh 
International since 1955. Now 
his work will become even more 
a part of the artistic life of 
Pittsburgh: this exhibition her
alds the forthcoming unveiling 
of a 14 x 20 ceramic tile murat 
by Soulages which was com
missioned by the Oliver-Tyrone 
Corp. The mural will occupy 
an entire central lobby wall of 
their new building, One Oliver 
Plaza.
Soulages first exhibited in 
1947 and received world - wide 
recognition when, in 1948, the 
exhibition of Contemporary 
French Art was circulated to 
German museums. Since then 
he has exhibited widely and his 
works are in virtually every ma
jor museum collection in the 
world. He was awarded a prize 
at the Sao Paulo Bienal in 1953, 
received an award by the Duke 
and Duchess of Windsor for the 
Best Painter in France in 1957, 
the First International Prize at 
the Tokyo Biennale in 1957, and 
the Carnegie Institute Award in 
1964. Soulages has done the

ACADEMIC AFFAIRS
Present: E. R. Schatz, Chair
man; R. Brandenburg, S. DeBenedetti, R. Hexter, R. Kibbee, 
M. Lovell, W. Mullins, D. New
man, C. Nodine, S. Platt, N. 
Rice, S. Rosen, R. Stafford, H. 
Robinson, E. Steinberg, O. Winsand; G. Fahey.
Dr. Schatz opened the meet
ing by reading a correction to 
the minutes of the February 12 
meeting. The statement, ROTC 
is not substituted for any re
quired subject or course for 
graduation, is in error. Stu
dents enrolled in ROTC are sub
stituting this for Physical Edu
cation, and have been since Sep
tember vy 1959 by action of the 
Executive Board.
Use of Private Clubs 
by the University
Dr. Schatz stated that in for
mulating a Carnegie -Mellon 
University policy regarding the 
use of private social clubs for 
University functions it might be 
helpful to explore the actions 
taken by the University of Pitts
burgh in establishing their poli
cy. The attached documents 
were distributed to the Commit
tee.
Dr. George Fahey, Professor 
of Psychology and Chairman of 
the Faculty of the University 
of Pittsburgh, was introduced 
and elaborated further on Pitts 
policy statement. Dr. Fahey re
ported that the policy, which 
was initiated by the administra
tion and reaffirmed by the Uni
versity Senate, has been in ef
fect since 1963. He stated that 
the policy statement included 
the use of all private social 
clubs, with no exceptions, and 
that it applies to the entire Uni
versity, not just to the faculty.
Dr. Fahey went on to say that 
the thin line as to what is and 
is not official probably results 
in many violations of the poli
cy. Private clubs are used for 
recruiting-type lunches and for 
quasi-official entertaining. He 
emphasized, however, that a pro
test against any violation of the 
policy could be voiced from the 
Senate floor and could result in 
a vote of censure or disapproval. 
In response to a question, Dr. 
Fahey indicated that no addi
tional steps have been taken in 
the direction of making the 
policy work better or of modify
ing it. He said that people have 
found it comfortable to live 
vith.
At the conclusion of Dr. Faleys remarks, Dean Rice anounced that his committee 
(Deans Mullins and Steinberg 
md Dr. Hexter) will have a brief 
neeting in the very near future
to discuss first steps in establish
ing a policy for C-MU. Dr. Schatz 
added that this particular kind 
of problem should be given a lot 
of consideration by a number 
of campus groups and that a 
thorough discussion is impor
tant.
Requirements for Graduation
The Committee on Academic 
Standards has reviewed informa
tion on academic standards at 
Carnegie-Mellon and a number 
of other engineering schools and 
recommends the following 
changes in policy be adopted for 
undergraduate classes admitted 
in future years:
(1) In order to qualify for 
graduation a student must earn 
a minimum cumulative factor 
of 2.00 (including all failing 
grades), and a minimum cu
mulative factor of 2.00 in his 
departmental courses.
(2) Academic actions of pro
bation, suspension and drop 
should be based on a minimum 
of 1.50 at the end of the fresh
man year and 1.75 at the end of 
the sophomore year to be con
sistent with item (1).
(3) Grade distribution policies 
should be modified to permit 
the application of the above 
standards without substantial 
changes in student attrition.
The above recommendation 
were discussed at the October 
30 meeting of the Academic Af
fairs Committee, and at that 
time a request was made for 
each of the colleges to consider 
the matter further. Both the 
Fine Arts and CIT College Coun
cils approved the recommenda
tions. At a joint meeting of the 
College Councils if H&SS and 
MMCC it was decided to approve 
the recommendations with the 
following reservations, which 
are due to the lack of statistical 
data about graduation require
ments of comparable institu
tions:
The Council recognized that 
the problem concerning grade 
distribution is one that merits 
concern. However, the Council 
was not convinced that the Uni
versitys understanding of the 
nature of the problem is suffi
ciently clear to be able to for
mulate a policy. Some of the 
problems that are assumed are 
amendable to empirical study. 
It would be possible, for ex
ample, to study the relationship 
between grades and GRE scores 
in Carnegie-Mellon University 
as compared with those in otfier 
institutions.
After long discussion Council 
decided to approve the principle 
but hoped that it not be so in

rather policy until the research 
recommended in the preceding 
paragraph is undertaken. 
Dean Mullins agreed to clari

comparable institutions at the 
next Academic Affairs Commit
tee meeting. Dr. Schatz will dis

many new vistas to students in 
their chosen fields of musical 
careers because the opportun
ities are few; to teach, to per
form, or to compose (if he or 
she is talented enough). In 
working on College Concert 
Hall, the student producers can 
explore the possibilities of a ca
reer in the communications 
world.
In addition to the selection of 
their favorite pieces of classical 
music, students will include in
terviews, panel discussions, mu
sic news of their schools, or any 
special creative feature they in
novate for the intermission seg
ment of the program.
The music department faculty 
heads from the five schools 
greeted the proposal with en
thusiasm. Not only does the 
series give their students an op
portunity to express their cre
ativity and musical tastes, but 
College Concert Hall will also 
publicize the activities of Pitts
burghs musical academy world.

The three leads are double
cast, and Voltaires shoes will 
be filled by 22-year-old Alan 
Rowland, a senior painting ma
jor, and by John Fisler, a phys
ics pledge to Phi Kappa Theta. 
Though John is the younger of 
the two by four years, his vocal 
experience  at singing  is ex
tensive. For seven years, he was 
with the Dayton Rotar Boys 
Choir and toured much of the 
United States and Europe. Not 
to be upstaged, Alan simply 
states that his father spent 18 
years as pianist with the Perry 
Como Orchestra.
Pat Thompson and Carol Nissenson assume the role of Falraa, the head witch. Falma, it 
seems, is a most unusual witch: 
she is evil incarnatebut has a 
heart. The entire story would 
explain that statement, but as 
have to be revealed in order to 
you will see, it is quite true.
Both Pat and Carol are sopho
more voice majors and have 
some musical-theatre experience 
behind them. Pat, a native of 
Pittsburgh, studied Drama at 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse, plays 
the piano, organ, and bassoon, 
and intends to be a performer. 
Last year, Carol was in SAIs 
vce Pleasure Seekers and at 
Highland Park High School in 
Illinois was Lili in aguSdzgmH
lgzdy FgSmeu
The immediate victim of Fal
ma is Satia, a sweet, young 
thing who the witches wish to 
resurrect from the dead in or
der to have her serve them. 
Peggy Hayes and Corine Tut
tle will have the chance to 
bring Satia to life on stage. 
Both girls are majoring in mu
sicPeggy with her cello and 
Corine with her vocal chords. 
Peggy is a rather busy, young 
blond since she is a member of 
SAI, Phi Kappa Phi, had^ the 
lead in Pippin-Pippin and will 
teach next year, and plans to 
be married in August.
Corine, whose father, Dr. Al
fred Tuttle, is well known to 
those who frequent Shadyside
Hospital, also manages to keep 
occupied. A member of Kappa 
Alpha Theta and Phi Tau Gam
ma, this is her second year with 
Scotch and Soda. Until recent
ly, Corine entered her horse in 
shows and apparently had the 
habit of winning. Right now, 
shes impressed with author-director Steve Schwartz, saying, 
Hes so well organized and he 
knows exactly what he wants. 
Besides that, hes a good judge 
of time and humor. The hu
mor, she says, is very useful 
during long rehearsals.
Steve is a senior directing ma
jor and says that Originally 
?imngdue gSy nce 0dntcef was
n't intended as an opera. But it 
soon became apparent that this 
story did not call for dialogue. 
Also, I just got hung-up on op
era.
The result is an unusual mu
sical which presents its primary 
character as a personage straight 
from a history book.

What happpens is that Wil
liam Shakespeare is the type of 
fellow more properly referred 
to as Bill or Willy. Love
able, bumbling, gullible, taken 
to the big city, Bill is pic
tured as naive, but intelligent 
enough to fool the public! 
Freshman Mike Sugarman, a 
Mech. E. pledge to Phi Kappa 
Theta, says that is a pretty good 
description of himself, too. Mike, 
who plays the Bard, auditioned 
for the show because I heard 
they had a part for the rear-end 
of a horse, so I figured that 
someone with as few brains as 
me would have a lot to look 
forward to. During the course 
of  the play, Mike, as Shakes
peare, has a chance to sing to 
the horse who, by the way, is in 
the habit of criticizing Bills-poetry.
Besides fraternity, Mike is ac
tive in IM football and soccer. 
He is from Marblehead, Mass., 
a town of 15,000, near Salem. 
It has a newspaper which is 
read by three people and two 
cows. Mike must have been 
active in high school, because 
when asked about, he said, If 
I went through the list, youd 
probably be sitting here falling 
asleep. David Spangler said 
that when he cast the show, he 
taried to type-cast. Billy Shakes
peare should be a very interest
ing person.
The Dark Lady is not exact
ly usual, either. Played by Bar
bara Bralver, the cloak of mys
tery that hangs about her is 
not lifted until very nearly the 
end of the story. Who she is 
and what her secret is must remafri unknown until then. In

Varsity Schedule 
Aim of Soccer Club
by Don Baer
Soccer seems to be a growing 
sport throughout this country. 
In the past few years many col
leges and high schools have add
ed soccer to their varsity sports 
program, and professional soc
cer has made its appearance. 
The reason for the popularity 
of soccer are many.
The only required equipment 
is a soccer ball and players. 
Skill in soccer does not depend 
on height or weight, and it is an 
excellent body conditioner. Soc
cer is the foundation from which 
sports such as hockey, polo, and 
American football were built. 
Soccer is the worlds most pop
ular participant sport with 100 
million active players and has 
one of the lowest injury rates ir\ 
competitive sports.
Interest in soccer is even pre
sent at C-MU. As an outgrowth 
of C-MUs strong IM program 
a soccer club is being formed, 
which hopes to form the basis 
for a varsity team. The club has 
several games scheduled this 
spring, the first one being 
against Pitt on March 30. Games 
are also scheduled against Point 
Park, Youngstown State, and 
several independent soccer clubs. 
Several schools in the area are 
starting soccer teams on an ex
perimental club basis and there 
is hope that a soccer league will 
be formed. This league would 
grow and develop with all teams 
learning together.

Basketball Wrap-Up
by ALAN LETZT, Tartan Sports Staff
When the basketball season began a long three and one half 
months ago, discussions of the teams prospects were saturated with 
the comments theyre inexperienced, Its all up to Lang, If 
only Kalin could play, and three winsif theyre lucky.
Although Mark Lane and Neil Houser were the only varsity 
players to have finished the previous season with a better than 5 
point per game average, the squad was not composed of neophytes 
four other players had appeared in fourteen or more games last year. 
In any case, the Tartans did not have Kalin or Burdett or Keefer to 
lead the team but they completed the first hall of their season with 
a 6-4 record.
Without doubt, Langs shooting and rebounding skills as well as 
sheer hustle proved to be a major factor in the CMU victories. But 
he did not bear the entire burden. John Meister and Barry Hummel 
both compiled averages of better than ten points per game. In fact, 
Lang was the leading scorer in only two of the first Tartan victories.
Reviewing this successful portion of the season, it is noteworthy 
that the Tartans were demolished in just two of the first ten matches; 
losses to Grove City and Wooster. Hummel was doing an excel
lent job off the boards and scoring points although most of his 
achievements were by brute force and his form far from graceful. 
Bill Weborg was coming off the bench frequently and performed 
well. But the Tartans often lost their cool and compiled an excessive 
number of turnovers, especially when confronted by a full court press. 
Another negative aspect was the inability of the guards to pose a 
sufficiently potent scoring threat which would have a lot of the pres
sure off the inside men. Houser and DeHuff played well enough on 
defense but rarely hit for double figures. Snow Mitchell was a re
serve who contributed to the teams success as he demonstrated his 
speed and ball handling, but he was not a prolific scorer either.........
Facing competition of equal caliber, the Tartans were able to 
overcome their weaknesses and play an aggressive, winning brand 
of basketball. However, the final half of the season was a disaster 
as the Tartans came through with only one victory in their final 
eleven games.
Their collapse can be mainly attributed to the much tougher 
schedule. The CMU opposition, which consisted of Pitt, Penn State 
and Westminster, among others, provided competition which is out 
of their league. The CMU composite record of 44-217 against these 
three teams serves to emphasize this fact further. Against the easier 
teams, CMU suffered three 2 point losses and a double overtime 
defeat.
Paradoxically, these games revealed an improved team effort 
and more poise on the court. Barry Hummel missed the final five 
games of the season but Bob Grazzini and Bill Abraham took up 
the slack to give CMU a better scoring attack and rebounding 
strength. Thus, the original starting five of Lang, Hummel, Meister, 
Houser and DeHuff was crashed by two players who had been de
moted to J-V play earlier in the year. Lang continued to stand out. 
He set a season record with 159 field goals and led the Tartans with

IM REVIEW
Old Men Win IM Basketball
by HAROLD HERRE
QUARTER FINALS
Upsets marked the quarter finals of intramural basketball. 
In the most stunning upset of the season, the highly rated EJs Cou
gars were dumped by GSIAs. The Cougars played an unin
spired first half, scoring only 9 points in the initial 16 minutes, while 
GSIA scored 13 in the opening periods. Things got rolling in the 
second half. John Schaefer, who sat out the first half, came on to 
score 9 points, while Dick Ardern scored 8 of his 10 points in the 
second half. Overall GSIA S dominated the game. The final 
score was GSIA 43, EJs 34. Bill Friesell took game scoring honors 
with 11 points. Jim Brown scored an unusually low 10 points for EJs.
In one of the play-offs closest games SN upset BTP 36-33. Both 
teams had difficulty breaking the opposing defense as Beta was un
able to hit from the outside against the zone and SN had trouble 
with Betas tight man-to-man. The game was marked by a lot of 
fouling but neither team gained an advantage from the foul line, 
as Beta hit 13 for 21 while SN had 12-25. Dale Klein was high 
scorer with 13 while Jack Loew had 10 for SN. Ed Dolbow, shut
out for 3 quarters, had 9 points from the foul line to ice the game 
for SN.
The Civil Hammers bested ATO A 47-40 in a quarter final 
contest. Chuck Oliver had 19 for Civil Hammers. Tony Bugel paced 
ATO with 16.
In the other semi-final game, the Old Men crushed SAE 55-35. 
The game was never a contest as the Old Men fast-broke their way 
to a 18-12 halftime margin. In the second half, they pulled away 
even further to the final 20 point bulge. Ray Burdett paced the Old 
Men with 15 points. Dick Sehlin had 14 points. Jake Miklojick 
scored 12 while Jim Pranaitis scored 13 for SAE.
SEMI-FINALS
GSIA faced the Civil Hammers in the first semi-final contest. 
GSIA surged to a 13-2 bulge after the first quarter, but they could 
not maintain the pace in the second quarter where they were out> 
scored 16-9. GSIA got little first half scoring from Dale Johnson and 
Dick Ardern: between them, they scored only 5 points. In the second 
half, Ardern continued his lackluster performance, but Johnson was 
hot. He scored 16 points in the second half. The Civil Hammers were 
getting balanced scoring from their forwards and guards. The game 
really became close with 1:30 remaining, when Ray Metz of the 
Hammers connected to tie the score 40-40. Deck Arderns 2 free 
throws put GSIA 2 points ahead 42-40. Ernie Purti scored to tie the 
game 42-42. George Lynch hit for GSIA to make the score 44-42. 
The game was iced by Johnsons 2 free throws to make the final 
score 46-42 in favor of GSIA.

The other semi final pitted SN against the Old Men. The game 
was close for the first 2 periods. At the half the score was 23-15, 
Old Men infront. The second half was no contest, as the Old Men 
outscored SN 30-14. This led to the final score of 53-29 in favor of 
the Old Men. The key to the game was the dfensive effort of Ray 
Burdett on Ed Dolbow of SN. Dolbow, normally a high scorer was 
limited to 2 points by the former Tech Varsity captain and MVP. 
Burdett scored 15 points. Dick Selkin led the Old Men with 18 points, 
while Ernie Toth was high for SN with 12.

CONSOLATION GAME
SN bested the Civil Hammers to take the third spot in the school. 
SN was in command of the game all the way. The first quarter was 
highlighted by 6 points by Ernie Toth, while the entire Civil Hammer 
team scored only 8. In the second period Ed Dolbow came alive. 
Dolbows 10 points in the period led SN to a 28-15 halftime bulge. 
The Civil Hammers had been hurt by the absence of big rebounder 
Roy Metz. Roy showed up near the end of the third period. His 
presence in the lineup sparked the Hammers to a 20 point fourth 
period output. It was not enough, as SN walked away with a 56-41 
victory. Ernie Toth took game scoring honors with 18 points. Dolbow 
scored 16 and Tony Rees had 11 for SN. The Hammers were paced 
by 17 points by Oliver.
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
The championship game was a battle of the small quick teams. 
It shaped up as an individual battle between Dick Ardern of GSIA 
and Ray Burdett of the Old Men. GSIA jumped off to an early lead 
despite the fact that two of their players, John Schaefer and George 
Lynch were not present. The Old Men employed a man-to-man de
fense with Burdett guarding Ardern. GSIA countered by clearing one 
side of the court to allow Ardern to go against Burdett 1 on 1. In 
this way, they hoped that Burdett w'ould get into early foul trouble. 
After the initial quarter, GSIA had a 14-9 lead. The second quarter 
score showed that the Old Men could come alive. In the first 4V 
minutes of the quarter, the Old Men scored 9 points, while GSIA was 
held scoreless. At halftime the Old Men led 22-19. In the second half 
the Old Men changed strategy. They put Dick Sehlin to guard Ar
dern. The strategy was effective as Ardern scored only 2 points in 
the half. With 2:55 remaining in the third period, the Old Men led 
34-24, but they became sloppy. With 58 seconds remaining in the 
third period, the Old Men led , but only 34-29. The fourth quarter 
began with Dale Johnson scoring 10 straight for GSIA, while Burdett 
scored 6 for Old Men. With 3 minutes remaining, GSIA went into 
a half court press. This cut the lead to 47-43 with 1:36 remaining. 
Bill Fresell converted 2 free throw's to make the score 47-45 in favor 
of the Old Men. With 1:28 remaining Burdett collected his fifth 
personal foul as he followed Larry Nixon. Burdett was also charged 
with a technical foul. Nixon missed his first attempt in the 1 + 1 
Bonus situation. Johnson missed the technical foul shot, but GSIA 
missed the technical foul shot, but GSIA got the ball at mid court 
with 1:28 remaining. Friesell was fouled on the throw in. He con
verted 1 free throw to make the score 47-46 in favor of the Old Men. 
Friesell them fouled out, but Walt Read missed both shots and GSIA 
got the ball on the rebound. Fred Portner was fouled by Ron Miller, 
but he missed the 1 and 1. Old Men rebounded and froze the ball. 
George Hill was fouled and made one to put the score 48-46 in favor 
of Old Men. A jump ball between Sehlin and Ardern resulted in Old 
Men getting the ball. GSIA stole the ball. With 9 second remaining, 
GSIA called time out. On the subsequent throw in, Dale Johnson 
took a jump shot which missed and went out of bounds. The Old 
Men got the ball with 4 seconds remaining. They froze the ball until 
time ran out. Final score Old Men 48, GSIA 46. Ray Burdett and 
Dale Johnson tied for scoring honors with 23 points each. Ardern 
scored 11 for GSIA.
Fouled Out: Burdett; Total fouls: 18.
Fouled out: Ardern and Friesell; Total fouls: 13.
WRAP-UP
wtHctdeo klwY PCne 8)
37 points in their seventh and final victory of the season. Meister 
was often erratic; however, he possesses th best jump shot on the 
team next to Lang. Snow Mitchell and Leigh DeHuff were not nearly 
as effective as during the first half of the year and were disappoint
ments in the backcourt but they have the ability to make vital con
tributions for the coming season.
Viewing the team statistically, a few additional facts are re
vealed. Their 39 per-cent accuracy from the floor could be im
proved but 62 per-cent foul shooting is way below par for a college 
varsity. Considering the number of one or two point defeats the 
Tartans suffered, more effective foul shooting is a must for next 
season.
With Hummel back in the line-up, and Grazzini, Abraham and 
Weborg prepared to begin the season as capable starters, Mark Lang 
may be placed in the backcourt along with Meister. Lang is an 
adept ball handler who has shown his ability to score from far out 
as well as underneath. This shift may cut down on his rebounding 
totals on offensive but should not diminish the teams effectiveness 
underneath. In fact, this move could make the press virtually in
effective against the Tartans which could be a great benefit as the 
Tartans seek to reverse their 7-14 record next year.

ALIENATION...
hwtHctdeo klwY PCne 1) 
prefer to sit around doing noth
ing. If he does engage in an 
activity, no real selection is in
volved for he simply takes the 
activity which is the least de
manding and which does not in
volve him in making any de
cisions. He puts forth the min
imal effort both physically and 
mentally. He still interacts with 
other people ,but his interactions 
are on tihe contractual level, nev
er deep and never intimate. This 
may seem like an extreme form 
of alienation and it is, but it is 
happening to man after man 
on this campus and on all other 
campuses in our country.
Lets take a look at the earlier 
form of alienation which seems 
to precede the complete apathy 
which has just been described. 
As an illustration, let us take 
a C-MU student. Whether he 
majors in physics or history 
he carries out his role a stu
yeSn gf he fcismyH He feef ncgn
he ought to study in order to 
prepare for examinations and 
to make good grades, and so 
he does so. It is the thing to do. 
He may put considerable value 
on the intellect. It is knowledge 
which matters, and it is the ac
quisition of facts Which is im
portant. He is in many ways an 
ideal student. He carries out his 
role as dormitory resident as he 
should. When he is a freshman, 
it is appropriate to join with 
the others When they throw co
ca cola bottles down the hall or 
remove the hinges from some
bodys door. It is appropriate 
to join the bull sessions that go 
on late into the night. He also 
carries out his role as a big man 
on campus. He looks for those 
positions on campus which will 
pay off for him and decides on 
the strategy which will bring 
him the position of fraternity 
president iu vgungS editor iu 
head of student government h 
the time he is a senior. If he 
is working, he also carries isn 
cdf uime gf eDFmiee dS nce hefn
way he knows how. He is on 
time and generally efficient. He 
also carries out his role of son 
of his parents in the proper way, 
for he acknowledges his obliga
tion to them and maintains his 
contact with them. He does not, 
however, really talk to them.
This man, however, usually 
has one other characteristic 
which is interesting. He puts 
considerable stress on his bio
logical needs. He wants immed
iate gratification of those physi
cal needs, whether it is food he 
wants, beer, or sexual satisfac
tion.
What is missing in this des
cription is anything related to 
the human side of man. There 
is no place for imagination for 
spontanity. There is no place for 
feeling. He carries out the social 
roles which he has assigned to 
himself, but he does so with
out any genuine understanding 
of what those roles mean or 
could mean to him. He does 
what is proper and lives by the 
usmef gf ce feef nceDH 'e gt
cepts the world the way it is 
and accepts the institutions as 
the proper ones carrying out 
their proper activities in the 
proper way. He is highly mater
ialistic and knows that every
one looks out for No. 1. He 
wants a good education to get 
a good job so he will make a 
lot of money and then join the 
affluent in our society. He is 
generally cynical and certainly 
fatalistic. He is also very cold
blooded in all of his relation
ships. They are contractual re
lationships, and there is no 
room for psychological intomacy.
There are, however, of worry 
and anxiety. He is always con
cerned about the impression he 
will make on others and wheth
er or not he is being admired by 
them. He wants to be seen as a 
conscientious young man who 
does what he ought to do. There 
is a conflict, however, because 
he also wants to satisfy his bio
logical needs and to satisfy them
directly and frequently. He is 
not satisfied with delayed grati
fication or with substitute forms 
of gratification. Some of the 
anxiety arises because he is not 
sure that he can make the im
pression he wants to on others 
and still satisfy the biological 
needs as frequently as he would 
like.
Now, however, comes the 
breakdown when our somewhat 
alienated student suddenly faces 
a new stress which is trauma
tic for him. One form of this 
stress is the sudden confron
tation which may occur wihtin 
the relationship with a girl 
friend. The relationship may 
have been developing quite well 
over a period of time, but sud
denly the girl friend confronts 
him with the statement that he 
doesnt really talk to her, or 
doesnt really care about her, 
or seems to be just trying to use 
her. Perhaps she will tell him 
that he acts like a computer and 
has no reail feeling.
