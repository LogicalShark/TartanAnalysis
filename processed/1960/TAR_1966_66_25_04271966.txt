Constitution Ready
Students To Vote
The proposed constitution for the Student Govern
ment, which was finally approved yesterday by both 
legislative and executive branches of the govern
ment, is being submitted to the student body for ratifi
cation by referendum ballot today, tomorrow, and 
Friday. ___
All full-time undergraduate stu
dents of Carnegie Tech are eligible 
to vote, and are encouraged to do 
so. Balloting is being conducted 
in a booth in the Baker Hall lob
by by APhiO today from 12:30 to 
2:30 p.m. and tomorrow and Fri
day from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
The constitution in its final form 
appears in this issue of the Tartan 
for examination by the students 
before voting. Among the changes 
made in it by the Constitution 
Committee since it last appeared 
in the Tartan, it includes, be
sides some minor changes sug
gested by the administration, a 
provision for commuter represen
tation on the Executive Council, 
a redefinition of the jurisdictions 
of the Courts, and separation of 
the Homecoming and Spring Car
nival Committees. The additional 
representative to the Executive 
Council was suggested by the cur
rent council, and the new delinea
tion of jurisdictions was ac
complished by the Constitution 
Committee in cooperation with re
presentatives of the Association 
of Women Students, the Council 
of Fraternity Presidents, the 
Mens Dormitory Council, and the 
Pan Hellenic Council.
BULLETIN
This article was written on Sunday 
in anticipation of Tuesdays Con
gress meeting, however due to the 
fire at the Beta Sigma Rho frater
nity house, the Caigress meeting 
was cancelled, and the ratifica
tion ballot was postponed.
The document has already met 
with the approval of the adminis
tration, and it is hoped that it will 
be accepted enthusiastically by the 
student body this week. Immediate 
ratification will allow Student Go
vernment elections to be conduct
ed as soon as possible to permit 
the organization of next years go
vernment under the provisions of 
the new constitution.
Keep Off The Grass
The administration has again 
asked for student cooperation in 
preserving what little green grass 
remains on the cut. In particular, 
this includes the Fine Arts lawn, 
where a path-away is gradually 
forming between the north-west 
corner of Fine Arts, and the front 
door of the library. It is hoped 
that a major portion of the cut can 
be reseeded by June.
However, the administration 
wishes to emphasize that their re
quest is not meant to curtail the 
use of the grassy areas for re
laxation and eitfoyment purposes.

Food Plan 
Instituted
Pittsburgh, Pa., April 22, 1966
 Carnegie Tech students and fa
culty soon will carry more weight 
in determining the kind of food 
service they get on campus under 
a program being cooked up by the 
administration.
It may not be days of wine and 
roses, but the school is going to be 
more receptive to student and 
other campus community require
ments, according to L. E. Price, 
Techs Food Service Coordinator.
The new program, which was 
hashed out and revealed this week, 
will result in terminating Techs 
food contract with Stouffers Ma
nagement Food Service Division 
July 1. After that, Tech will as
sume full management of its food 
operations.
Under the program, Mr. Price 
will work with a student manage
ment council and a faculty com
mittee on menus and other aspects 
of food service. While maintaining 
high nutritional standards, con
sideration of the customers wants 
are vital, Mr. Price said.
The new program also calls 
for greater participation by home 
economics students from Marga
ret Morrison College. We would 
be foolish not to make use of

1966-67 Calendar Released; 
Ad Hoc IdeaNot Feasible
The 1966-1967 School calendar has been released by the Administration, and is 
now available in the bookstore. This calendar was formulated by the Standing 
Calendar Committee headed by Dean Brown, at the request of the Administrative 
Council, after calendar proposals made by the ad hoc Committee were rejected
for two major reasons.
Sophomore Girls Move
Into Apartments in Fall
Sophomore woman will be housed in the E-Tower 
and Colonial Manor Apartments next semester. Of the 
268 freshmen women who reside in MorewoodGardens 
this semester, 160 drew for dormitory rooms. Fiftyeight signed up for Colonial Manor and 10 chose to 
live in E-Tower. ------------------------------------
According to Virginia B. Milli
gan, dean of women, the sophomor
es will be subject to Morewood 
regulations. We have not gotten 
the machinery worked out, but the 
same regulations will be maintain
ed, she says. At 12:30 a.m. 
someone will have to check on who 
is not in.
Dean Milligan will live at Colon
ial Manor, and security men will 
be posted at apartment entrances.
Apparently, the apartments were 
provided for women in order to
Carnival Tickets
Tickets for Spring Carnival are 
now on sale from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 
p.m. in Baker Hall lobby and at the 
Skibo information desk. Prices for 
the weekend are as follows: 10 dol
lars per couple for the weekend,
4 dollars per person for the Fri
day night concert, and 2 dollars 
per person for the Saturday night 
dance. The concert on Friday night 
will not be held in the gym as in 
the past; this year it will be at the 
Carnegie Music Hall and dress 
for this event will be coat and tie.
Band Presents Local Premier 
Of Commissioned Fantasia
The Carnegie Tech Kiltie Symphony Band will pre
sent its Spring Concert on May 1 at 8:15 in Carnegie 
Music Hall, Oakland. Music will consist of works play
ed on the recent New York tour which won praise 
from New York critics and audiences.
The featured work on Sundays was given its premier perforconcert will be Edward Maddens mance in New Yorks Town Hall 
Carnegie Fantasia, which was and will be presented to Pittscommissioned for the band by its burgh audiences for the first time 
director, Dr. Richard E. Strange, on Sunday.

unload the dormitory. Upper
classmen were given the first op
portunity to select spaces, but they 
did not fill the available 100.
Of the 102 juniors in the dormi
tory this past September, 68 chose 
to remain in Morewood Gardens 
next semester. The class contains 
193 women. From a sophomore 
class of 272, 150 women drew for 
dormitory rooms. Presently, 214 
live in the dormitory. This left 
238 freshmen with an allotted 111 
spaces.
In order to avoid triple rooms, 
the Administration had reserved 
three rooms on each floor of the 
old towers, and E-Tower rooms 
on each floor (a total of 285 
spaces) for incoming freshmen. 
The size of this incoming class 
should approximately equal that of 
the present freshman class.
Dean Milligan feels that in the 
future, more upperclass women 
will choose to reside in the apart
ments.

Architects Speak

First, the final form of the adhoc Calendar was presented too 
late in the year to be considered, 
since considerable discussion had 
developed among faculty members 
as to the changes the calendar 
would involve. Secondly, a coope
rative calendar year for five of 
Pittsburghs universities (Duquesne, Chatham, Tech, Pitt, and Mount 
Mercy), had been proposed by the 
presidents of these institutions. 
This would enable students of these 
universities to participate in inter-university courses, without the 
mix-ups and red tape now involved 
in taking such courses. Thus at the 
request of President Stever, the 
ad hoc committee tabled its pro
posal, and the Standing Calendar 
Committee was asked to draw up 
a calendar for 1966-1967 similar 
to the present one.
An inter-university committee, 
composed of representatives of the 
five universities previously men
tioned, has been established to aid 
in formulating a calendar for each 
institution that will contain the 
same basic features. According 
to Dr. Robert Kibbee, Vice Presi
dent for Planning, and Techs re
presentative on this committee, 
Calendars proposed by two of the 
other institutions are similar to 
the proposals made by the adhoc committee, in their common 
desire to finish the first semes
ter by Christmas recess. The com
mittee will meet once more this

Carnegie Museum Exhibits 
Two Kinetic Sculptors
The Carnegie Institute Museum of Art will open an 
exhibition Two Kinetic Sculptors: Nicolas Schoffer 
and Jean Tinguely on April 28.The exhibition contrasts two diametrically opposed 
attitudes towards the machine in art, and is conceived as a study of the two extremes in the kinetic 
movement, which is the introduction of time and ac
tual physical motion into art forms.
Hungarian - born Nicholas'
Schoffer exhibited his first cy
bernetic, or electronically auto* 
mated sculpture in 1957: a luminodynamic spectacle of colored 
light in constantly changing ab
stract patterns. His automated and 
programmed structures in the 
Carnegie Museum include CYSP I, 
which responds to human presence 
and external changes via a delicate 
electronic brain: Infinite
Prism, which reflects to infini
ty the light projections of one of 
his automated sculptures, Lux 
IP', and others.
Jean Tinguely has been descri
bed as the big wheel of the 
Movement Movement, having be
gun in 1953 in Paris galleries.
He acquired notoriety for his selfdestroying machine which anni
hilated itself at a spectacle stag
ed at the Museum of Modern Art 
in 1960.
The exhibition will be open week
days from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 
Sundays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
until May 29.

J. Leslie Hicks, Jr., manager of

Tech Artists 
Win Honors 
At Exhibition
Carol Engelson, senior 
painting and design, has 
won top honors for her ab
stract oil on canvas at the first National Invitational 
Student Art Exhibition currently being held at State 
University College, New Paltz, New York.
Judges for the Exhibition were 
Lawrence Alloway, Curator of the 
Guggenheim Museum, Clement 
Greenberg, internationally recog
nized art critic and Roy Lichten
stein, nationally - known pop ar
tist.
Greenberg termed Miss Englesons painting remarkably origi
nal. Roy Lichtenstein said the 
award - winning untitled abstract 
was one of the less self - 
conscious works . . . original 
because it didnt appear as though 
the student was striving for ori
ginality. Lichtenstein further de
scribed the Engelson work as 
consistent and orderly.
Along with top honors for Carol 
Engelsons painting, Carnegie 
Tech also received a commenda
tion for student Donald Stettners 
oil on canvas entitled Stream.
The National Invitational Student 
Art Exhibition was sponsored by 
the New Paltz chapter of Kappa

Awards Festival Patterned 
In Old English Tradition
Musicians from Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana 
have been selected to judge the Carnegie Awards 
Festival - the only music and dance competition 
of its kind in the United States patterned after a traditional English program.
The fifth annual Festival will be 
held April 29 and 30 at Carnegie 
Tech, sponsored by the College 
of Fine Arts.
Judges will be: Mrs. Eleanor Pudil Anop, associate professor of 
music, Kent State University, 
Kent, Ohio; Miss Diane Page, fa
culty, Indiana University School 
of Music, Bloomington, Indiana; 
Francis Borkowski, assistant pro
fessor of music, West Virginia 
University, Morgantown, West 
Virginia, Roger Sherman, trum
pet instructor and Brass Ensem
ble director, Creative Arts Cen
ter, West Virginia University; 
Harold Fink, head of fine arts 
area at Lake Erie College, Painesville, Ohio; Bernard Linden, 
professor of viola and ensemble, 
Bowling Green State University, 
Bowling Green, Ohio.
The Festival is designed to fos
ter artistic advancement through 
performance, to evaluate perfor
mance and to reward outstanding 
performance. Judging is based on 
standards established by the jud
ges, not on comparative ability.
Coordinator of the program is 
Philip B. Catelinet, executive sec
retary, Carnegie Awards Fes
tival, and an assistant professor 
of music.
Catelinet brought the idea for 
such a music and dance program 
to Carnegie from his native Eng
land. It is the only festival of 
its kind in this country, so far as
I know, he said.
The Festival features 99 class
es of competition, including instru
mental and vocal soloists; string, 
wood-wind and brass ensemble, 
orchestra, band, chorus, and a 
special dance section. It is open 
to students and non-professionals.
The public will be admitted to 
all competitions, which will be 
held on the Carnegie Tech campus, 
at Central District Catholic High 
School auditorium and the YM & 
WHA Morris Kaufmann Audi
torium.
Cash prizes, certificates, cups 
and trophies will be awarded at a

Editorial
To Cure Inertia
The Tech Student Government 
(SG) has been the subject and 
focal point of considerable con-| 
troversy and appraisal in the past 
year. To the optimists, it re-1 
presents a method of communi-l 
cation between students and the 
administration. Student needs and 
desires can first be discussed 
and critically evaluated by such an| 
organization, and then presented in 
a formal, finalized edition to the 
Administration for their consider
ation, and approval or rejection. 
Further, it represents a means 
of communicating with ones fellow 
students on matters of student in
terest. Finally, it is, in general, j 
directly responsible for much of 
the student activity on campus.
On the other hand, the disin-| 
terested, and critical majority 
contend that Student Government 
is merely a reduntant, pedantic, 
and inactive organization existing 
only through the kindness of the 
administration for those who con
sider themselves campus leaders, 
who privately voice the opinion 
that it will look good on my rec
ord. Basically, these people 
would advocate the elimination of 
Student Government as a middle
man, or simply dont care what 
SG does or where it goes.
A quick review of the editorial 
opinion expressed here in the past 
year will show the Tartan to be one 
of the more critical voices, al
though still professing a measure 
of optimism. TTie past record of 
Student Government will show nei
ther of the two extremes to be 
completely wrong, or right. There 
have been, in the past, cases 
which support the optimists claim 
that Student Government can be 
effective in presenting student
With another summer season 
close at hand, I shall conclude 
my comments from the middle 
of the bus. I wish to thank first 
of all my readers (and critics) 
who took an interest in the work 
of my long, hot summer. I wish 
to express my deepest gratitude 
to my parents who shared my hop
es and especially my fears and 
without whose support my work 
would not have been possible. 
Without them I might have bro-l 
ken down after the first week; 
without their bond money I would 
still be in jail. Thanks goes also 
to all those associated with SNCC 
and to those human beings, north 
and south, who helped by sharing 
our regard toward our fellow man.
Finally I would like to thank rhy

Music Workshop
The Carl Orff method of music 
will be introduced July 5 to 15 at 
a joint workshop on the campuses 
of Carnegie Tech and Mount Mer
cy College.
Conducting the workshop will 
be Mrs. James Carley and Miss 
Isabel Schack, under the co-ordi
nation of Maurice I. Laney, As
sistant head of Carnegie Techs 
music department.
TTie workshop is aimed chiefly 
at teachers, music students and 
the parents of 5 to 10 year old 
children. Participating teach
ers and students will re
ceive graduate credits from Car
negie Tech and undergraduate 
credits from Mount Mercy.
Tuition will be $68 for the two 
weeks. Enrollment informatior 
may be obtained from the music 
departments of either school.
opinion and desires to the admi-i 
nistration, with the resultant de
sired effect. The change in li
brary hours last year is certain
ly a case in point.
However, in weighing such posi
tive factors against the ineffective
ness, and inactivity of a govern-, 
ment bogged down with internal 
disputes and power struggles which 
sometimes render that body vir
tually useless, one cannot help 
but feel sympathetic toward the 
pessimistic point of view.
Although some of the previous 
problems surrounding SG involv
ed personality conflicts a great 
portion of the difficulty can be 
attributed to an out-dated ambi
guous constitution, which result
ed in much of the redundancy and 
ineffectiveness of SG.
The Tech Administration feels, 
and the Tartan supports its view 
that the students and student ac
tivities should remain autonomous 
in so far as possible, and should 
have the right and responsibility 
to determine and govern their 
activities. Student Government is 
the only practical and feasible 
method of adhering to this prin
ciple. In view of the present state 
of affairs, there is but one solu
tion; a new SG must be formulat
ed based on this new constitution.
The Tartan would not go so far 
as to claim that a new constitu
tion would be a panacea for an 
ailing government, but this would 
be a great stride in curing the 
inertia that plagues SG. The con
stitution again appears in the Tar
tan, in a revised form. The Tartan 
urges, and would in fact, implore 
the student body to read the con
stitution, and vote for its ratifica
tion.
each week to iron out the gramma
tical rough spots in the manuscript 
prior to publication. (He is also to 
be congratulated for his measure 
of self-control with regard to Mr. 
MalakofPs style and in some places 
his ideology - Ed.)
This summer, of course, many 
others will pick up where we left 
off, and to them I wish to extend 
hopes for success, for in them and 
those that follow lies the very fu
ture of humanity.
Donner Joins 
R. Morris
Marvin Donner, former assis
tant to the dean of men, has re
signed this position in order to 
become assistant to the dean of 
students and acting dean of men at 
Robert Morris Junior College.
A graduate of the University of 
Pittsburgh where he received his 
bachelors degree, in 1954, he ser
ved as a lieutenant in the Unitec 
States Air Force and returned tc 
the University of Pittsburgh ir 
1958 for his teaching certification.
As assistant dean of men, Don
ner was responsible for advising 
dormitory residents on social, po
litical, and recreational matters.
Donner stated, My main ob
jective at Tech was to establish 
a good relationship between the 
student body and the administra
tion. I have never worked with a 
more fascinating and diversified 
group of students. However, wher 
the opportunity for me to have a 
more direct relationship with a 
student body arose, I resigned my 
position*.

TechsBagpipes 
Not First In City
Editor, the Tartan:
In regards to your article un
der Nature of the University, 
April 20th, your opening sentence, 
which mentioned, before the 
sound of bagpipes came to Pitts
burgh, etc., is a little inaccu
rate. Some research on the matter 
will show that bagpipes were heard 
here at least as early as the fall 
of 1758 when Major James Grant 
(Grants Hill, Grant Street, etc.) 
and his Highlanders had an unsuc
cessful encounter with the French 
and Indians outside Fort Duquesne (about 50 Highlanders un
der Captain MacDonald marched 
directly at the fort beating the 
drums and playing the Bagpipes); 
then 2 weeks later when General 
Forbes eventually took the fort, 
and again in 1763 when Colonel 
Bouquets 42nd Highlanders, the 
Black Watch and some of the 
77th Montgomerys Highlanders 
out of Fort Ligonier via Bushy Run 
rescued the survivors of the In
dian siege of Fort Pitt. Some of 
our pipers today may be descen
dants of these men.
I thought your article was very 
interesting and informative. Lets 
hope that Tech can remain a pri
vate institution and not have to 
be taken over with state controls.
Sincerely,
A friend of the pipers.

Candidates for Spring Carnival Queen were named 
by the seven sororities on campus last week. The queen 
and her court are to be elected by an all-campus 
vote and crowned at the Carnival Concert on Friday 
night, May 6.
Candidates will be presented by their sororities in song-anddance skits in the gym this Friday at 4:30 p.m. The theme of the skits 
is Traditional Fairy Tales, the same theme as that of the Carnival.
Pam Mayer appears as the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland

Ugly Man Candidates Appear; 
Campus toStuff Ballot Box
Yes, kiddies, the Ugly Men are still on campus. 
Rising from the coal mine in the seventh sub-basement of Hamerschlag Hall, creeping from the steam 
tunnels, scrambling from the diggings on the Cut, 
swimming out from under Westinghouse Memorial, 
the Princes of Ugly have again assembled to contend, 
face to face (Ugh!), for the title of the Ugliest Man 
on Campus.
Being true, flag-waving Ameri
can Uglies, they have agreed with 
UMOC Chairman Bruce Kinney 
that the selection should be on the 
basis of carefully scrutinized bal
lot box stuffing. A poll tax of one 
cent per vote will be administer
ed by Alpha Phi Omega, the pro
ceeds going to Campus Chest.
Each of the fifteen contenders 
has had his appearance condem
ned by a campus group. Phi Kap
pa Theta has lost several of its 
flock to the Good Shepherd, but 
they are resisting him with all 
their might. Horn Man has been 
haunting Delta Upsilon and it is 
said that The Bush has made the
Joan Jaques
Sherri Rakoff
Delta Tau Delta brothers cringe.
Pi Kappa Alpha has confirm
ed the grotesque properties of 
Shmack while the Tartan has been 
strangely quiet about the mysteri
ous Erik. Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
has attested to the wierdness of 
Palpitating Pax. Beta Sigma Rho 
has endorsed the ugliness of Ben
ny J and Cameron Choir has been 
singing the curses of Baby Huey.
Die Wasserspeiersbeobachtersgesellschaft has nominated Ugly 
Mann for the Title. Mens Dorm 
Council and Claymore Clan have 
joined forces to throw out Vic Del

out Rachel Ralph. Last years 
winner, Sigma Nu, is fanning the 
Flying Flame.

London Seminar To Study 
Management Ed In The UK
H. Igar- Ansoff, professor of Industrial Admini
stration at Carnegie Tech will direct a July AngloAmerican seminar in London on the problems con
fronting management education in the United King
dom.
Carnegie Tech faculty members Harold J. Lea
vitt, professor of industrial administration and psy
chology, and Herbert A. Simon, associate dean of the 
Graduate School of Industrial Administration and pro
fessor of administration and psychology are also
participating.
The seminar evolved from the 
efforts of B. Bach, Techs Mau
rice Falk professor of economics 
and social sciences, and Mar
shall Robinson of the Ford Foun
dation who thought that such a 
session of representatives from 
leading U. S. Schools and top 
Britons would be useful.
It is sponsored by the Foun
dation for Management Education, 
a British organization supported 
by the government and English 
business groups.
Robinson, former dean of the 
business school at the University 
of Pittsburgh will be keynote 
speaker at the seminar.
The seminar will concentrate
of two areas:
1. Sessions conducted by the 
Americans on management curri
cula and methods in U.S. Schools.
2. Working group sessions ~ 
led by the British  to examine 
in broad terms the problems con
fronting management in the United 
Kingdom, aided by the Americans 
who have had experience with si
milar issues.
In addition to directing the en
tire program, Professor An
soff will lecture on business stra
tegy. Professor Leavitt will dis
cuss behaviorial science, while 
Professor Simon will discuss the 
broad role of computers in teach
ing and learning.

WRCT Prods Complaints;
Station Will Repeat Show
A furor broke out last night at the WRCT studios 
over the Relaxative, WRCT Presents God, which 
went on the air earlier in the evening. Moments 
after the broadcast, personally - delivered letters 
were brought to the TARTAN editor from * irate* * 
and * outraged* * listeners. ------------------------------------
Asked to publish these letters, 
the TARTAN asked Barry Cornet, 
the WRCT program director, for 
a statement on the controversy 
caused by the Relaxative he had 
written, produced and directed. 
The following are samples of the 
letters:
Dear Mr. Cornet,
I am shocked and outraged by 
the tasteless, offensive half-hour 
of heresy that you broadcast last 
night. I think that a campus radio 
station should be used to enter
tain its listeners, not to irk them. 
Please stop broadcasting offensive 
programming.
David Green
Program Director,
The type of show that you broad
cast last night, mainly The Re
laxative," shows the distasteful 
contempt with which you regard 
the idea of God in our modern 
society. Who are you to disrespect
the beliefs of others? I'll have 
you know that I am sending a copy 
of this complaint to the TARTAN. 
I hope they will stop this horrible 
outflow of blasphemy.
Sharon Kubrlk
Mr. Barry Cornet commented 
as follows on the eruption of com
plaints:
This show will be rebroad
cast this Tuesday at 7:30, as I 
would like those who missed it to 
judge it for themselves against 
the allegations made in your pap
er. I have been accused of all 
things  but heresy! Ridiculous I 
In the first place this show was 
taped as a positive didactic state
ment aimed -at the great deal of 
apathy present on the campus. 
We were interested in provoking 
a little thought on the subject of 
Christian existentialism. The on
ly justification for these letters 
seems to be that those who sent 
them were not listening very 
hard."
Students Assist * 
In Summer School
Carnegie Tech students have 
been selected to assist in the 
school's summer programs. Dan 
Kamin and JUlie Frankel, sopho
mores, painting and design, will 
help to organize a cultural and 
recreational program for approxi
mately 300 pre-college students. %
Upward Bound (formerly call
ed SCOPP) will employ Joella 
Kwasniewski, sophomore, math; 
Ceil Bromberg, sophomore, busi
ness; Marianne Wisdom, fresh
man, humanities; Dan Cogan, jun
ior, industrial management; and 
Tal fourd Pierce, freshman, paint
ing and design.
These students were selected 
on the basis of interviews and academic qualifications. They will 
serve as tutors and supervisors.
Dutch Architect
Joost Baljeu, a well-known Dutch 
architect, will speak to architec
ture and P & D students on Mon
day, May 2. Mr. Baljeu is the edi
tor of an international paper call- f 
ed Structure," which is devot
ed to hard-edged construction in 
art and architecture. He will dis
cuss this type of construction and 
its particular bearing on archi
tecture.
Graduation was only the beginning 
of Jim Browns education
Because he joined Western Electric
Jim Brown, Northwestern University, 62, came 
with Western Electric because he had heard about 
the Companys concern for the continued develop
ment of its engineers after college graduation.
Jim has his degree in industrial engineering and 
b continuing to learn and grow in professional 
stature through Western Electrics Graduate Engi
neering Training Program. The objectives and edu
cational philosophy of this Program are in the best 
of academic traditions, designed for both experi
enced and new engineers.
Like other Western Electric engineers, Jim 
started out in this Program with a six-week course 
to help in the transition from the classroom to 
industry. Since then, Jim Brown has continued to 
take courses that will help him keep up with the 
newest engineering techniques in communications.
This training, together with formal college 
engineering studies, has given Jim the ability to 
develop his talents to the fullest extent His present 
responsibilities include the solution of engineer
ing problems in the manufacture of moly-permalloy core rings, a component used to improve the 
quality of voice transmission.
If you set the highest standards for yourself, 
enjoy a challenge, and have the qualifications 
were looking for  we want to talk to you! Oppor
tunities exist now for electrical, mechanical and 
industrial engineers, and for physical science, lib
eral arts and business majors. For more informa
tion. get your copy of the Western Electric Career 
Opportunities booklet from your Placement Officer.

Page 10 - CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN - Wednesday, April 27, 1966
Last Saturday the Carnegie Tech chapter of Tau 
Beta Pi held ceremonies commemorating its 50th year 
on campus. All alumni members were invited to the 
program which began at 1:30 p.m. and consisted of 
campus tours for the alumni, a coffee hour at which 
President Stever gave the opening address, initiation 
of new members, installation of chapter officers, and a 
banquet Saturday evening. Several national officers 
were present at the ceremonies.____________________
New officers are David Klein, 
junior, electrical engineering, 
president; Joe Nirschl, junior, 
chemical engineering vice-president; Art Heifer, junior, electri
cal engineering treasurer; John 
Murphy, junior, mechanical engi
neering recording secretary; and 
Steve Baker, junior, chemical en
gineering corresponding secreta
ry.
Tau Beta Pi, founded in 1885, 
is a national honor society for en
gineering and science students.
tive living options offered such 
as . . . sorority floors, and offcampus apartments, it will be
come increasingly difficult to re
cruit top quality floor counselor 
material. By providing full room 
for the counselor, the selection 
committee would also have the 
right to be more discriminating 
in its choices. The quality of the 
counselors should improve be
cause more girls would desire 
such a position."
The twenty-four mens dormi
tory counselors receive full room 
(equivalent to $280 a semester). 
Selected on the basis of recom
mendations and academic stand
ing, they are usually upperclass
men.
Appointed to look after the 
safety and welfare" of dormi
tory residents, they are also as
signed to sit at the Donner Desk. 
At present no faculty counselors 
reside in the men's dormitories.
It is the engineer's equivalent of 
Phi Beta Kappa, which accepts on
ly candidates for the Bachelor of 
Arts degree. Membership in Tau 
Beta Pi is open to junior and 
senior men studying for a Ba
chelor of Science degree.
Academic standing and demon
strated superior character and 
leadership ability are the basis 
for acceptance.

Morewood Selects
Floor Counselors
by Sue Attinson
Morewood Gardens floor counselor appointments 
have been announced by the Dean of Womens Of
fice.
From the 67 applicants these students were select
ed: Charlene Rettew, 2A; Elaine Conti, 3A; Marlene 
Hatch, 4A; Eileen Grossman, 5A; Bonnie Hatch, 6A; 
Cheryl Strohl, 3B; Lisa Hess, 4B; Marilyn Blitz, 5B;

Barrie Dinkins, Marianne Wisdom, 5E; Mary Jane 
Gilbert, Betsy Atkins, 6E; and Sue Ward, Laura Seidler, 7E. _______________________
Most of them will be juniors; 
some will be sophomores. Three 
have served as floor counselors 
this past year.
According to Virginia B. Milli
gan, dean of women, three agen
cies evaluated applicants: More
wood Gardens staff members, pre
sent dormitory counselors, and 
herself. In cases of differing points 
of view, other faculty members 
were consulted. There certain
ly was a lot of competition, she 
admits.
The applicants participated in 
training sessions with the dean 
during which floor counselor re
sponsibilities were outlined. Dur
ing the summer they should cor
respond with Incoming frosh and 
act as guides to these students 
during orientation week. They 
should organize periodic floor 
meetings.
Counselors Don't Counsel
It was emphasized that floor 
counselors should serve as com
munications centers, not as coun
selors.
Dean Milligan criticizes this 
year's system: Tilings have 
worked very well this second se
mester . . . first semester girls 
didn't get the idea that they were 
not to counsel." She claims that 1
Carnegie Tech lost several stu
dents because their problems were 
not pointed out to college autho
rities. An assistant dean will live 
at Morewood Gardens next year 
to handle such problems (those 
which can endanger the girl, 
herself, or people on her floor\ 
Petition Objects
In a statement composed and 
signed by approximately 60 pre
sent floor counselors and dor
mitory counselor representatives 
and presented to the Administra
tion in February, counseling was 
designated as an understood re
sponsibility. It has been suggest
ed that the Administration and 
the women disagreed on a defi
nition of the term.
The petition also recommend
ed that women be paid more than 
the present salary of $150 per 
semester for first year coun
selors and $200 per semester for 
veterans. It suggested full room 
remuneration as is the case with 
counselors in the men's dormito
ries.

Intercollegiate Council Proposes 
Lower PAT Fares for Commuters
An intercollegiate student council, composed of re
presentatives from Carnegie Tech, Pitt, Duquesne, 
Mount Mercy, and Point Park College, is drafting a 
letter to Port Authority Transit (Pittsburghs mass 
transit authority) requesting lower fares for college 
students who commute. ______________________
This letter was prompted by a 
recent Tartan and Pitt News poll 
of commuting students. The re
sponse was about 25% of the com
muters at Tech, and 50% of the 
commuters at Pitt. Fifty-five per
cent of those replying ride PAT 
buses or trolleys regularly, and 
about half of the other 45% said 
that they would rather ride PAT 
than drive or belong to a car pool.

After opening the week with an 80-1/2 to 62-1/2 loss at the hands of West

in this meet was Tech 91, Waynesburg 60, and St. Francis 30.

The Foul Line
By Larry Sikon
Yes, Spring is here. And, once again, a young mans fancy turns to 
the finer things in life  like baseball, for example. By now, every 
sports editor of every major newspaper in the United States has made 
his predictions for the outcome of the66 season  that is, every major 
newspaper other than the Carnegie Tech Tartan. So, not wanting to break 
tradition, I give you my predictions.
NATIONAL LEAGUE
1. Pittsburgh:: the Pirates well-balanced pitching and strong hitting, 
coupled with their ability to bounce back, will return the Pennant 
to Pittsburgh.
2. Atlanta: Tremendous power, but weak pitching will cause them to 
fall short of the Bucs.
3- San Francisco: What can I say other than Willie Mays.
4- Los Angeles: Strong pitching and weak hitting cant win the pen
nant twice in a row.
5. Philadelphia: Aquisition of White and Groat makes the Phillies 
a strong dark horse contender.
6. Cincinnati: Hie Reds traded away their scoring punch with Frank 
Robinson.
7- St. Louis: Mediocre pitching and hitting rule out the Cards as a con
tender.
8. Chicago: TTiey're improved, but still on 8th place team.
9. New York: Improved hitting will finally pull the Mets out of the
cellar.
10- Houston: With a little hitting to back their fine pitching, the Astros 
could finish much higher.
AMERICAN LEAGUE
1. Baltimore: The strong hitting of the Robinson Boys will more than 
make up for the weak pitching.
2- Cleveland: Tlie Indians could pitch themselves into the pennant 
with a few breaks.

Tech Golfers Drop Pitt,6-3
by George Smith
In the triangular track meet, 
Freshman Doug Crouse of 
Waynesburg set track records in 
both the mile and two mile runs 
while Mikulski of St. Francis set 
a new track record of 484 for 
the shotput.
Out of the 17 events, the Tar
tans recorded ten first place vic
tories. John Polles recorded vic
tories in both the 100-yard dash 
and the 220 while his teammate 
Jim Brezovec chalked up wins 
in both the 120 high hurdles and 
the 440 hurdles. George Mink, 
won the pole vault for the Tartans 
with a vault of 11 feet. Also 
recording victories for the Tar
tans were Ken Happach, Steve 
Aylor, Marshall Gile and Cris 
Macosko.
The Tartans recorded their vic
tory despite the loss of their lead
ing speedster in the 100-yard dash, 
Jeff Sheldon, who was out with mo
no. Also out of the meet was Den
ny Collins, wh* pulled a muscle 
in the 440 relay and was unable 
to compete in his other events.
The Tartans will host Wash

meet this Saturday in the final

As March and April roll round, 
chances of seeing someone out in 
a field swinging at a little white 
ball become increasingly proba
ble. This spring Coach William L. 
Rogers led fifteen boys and one 
girl to the Long Vue Golf Links. 
The harsh spring weather took 
quite a toll, and several prospects 
including our one female golfer 
had to drop out. Eventually the 
team was numbered to one sen
ior, Dale Johnson, four juniors, 
John Mulholland, Bob Blasier, Jim 
Brown, and Brugler; two sopho
mores, Bill Habel and Randy Gor
don; and two freshmen, Ron Woloshan and George Smith.
By April fifth the team had 
practiced and was ready for its 
first meet against our arch-rivals 
Pitt. TOe weather was not too
agreeable; it was twenty-eight de
grees, snowy and rainy. However, 
the sun shown through on the last 
few holes, lighting the way for 
Tech as she posted a decisive 
6-3 victory over Pitt.
In the next two meets, the team 
did not fare as well, losing away 
meets to St. Vincent and Bethany. 
Then, last Friday in a tri-meet, 
Tech beat Allegheny 5-2, while 
losing to Westminster by a simi
lar score.
Tech may not have its strong
est team ever, but it is probably 
one of the most well-rounded, in
dicated by the fact that, in its first 
five meets, the team had five dif
ferent medalists.
This week, the Tartans play host 
to Grove City here at Long Vue on 
Friday.
Tartans Lose 7-2 In Bethany Game *
by Mike Smolens
Twenty-one *'buggies, representing all twelve 
fraternities and the mens dorms, will race in the 
annual Carnegie Tech Sweepstakes on Spring Carni
val weekend. The buggies, (or more properly, pushmobiles), range in design from the standard soap
box derby* format with four small wheels and a ply
wood or fiberglas shell to the bicycle type with two ^ 
bike wheels and a simple tubular frame. After being 
pushed up the hill in front of Skibo Gym, the buggies 
coast through Schenley Park and past Phipps Conser
vatory to Scaife Hall, where they are pushed in relays 
up Frew Street tov the finish line behind GSIA.
The Tech netmen were defeat
ed by a thus-far unbeaten Bethany 
team at Bethany, West Virginia, 
last Wednesday. The 7-2 win mar
ked the fifth consecutive victory 
for the Bethany squad while the 
Tartans record dropped to 1-2.
At the first singles position, 
Salim Khan was defeated for the 
second straight year by Hunter, 
the left-handed tennis ace from 
Bethany, 6-2, 6-3. Leigh DeHuff 
took a 5-1 advantage in the crucial 
third set, but couldn't maintain 
it, and was beaten in a very 
close match 7-5, 3-6, 7-5. Bob 
Lowe likewise battled three sets 
before falling 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. Mike 
Smolens lost 6-4, 6-3. Also suf
fering defeats were Dick Londergan 6-3, 6-2, and Fred Stone 6-2, 
1-6, 6-2.
In the doubles competition which 
had no bearing on the outcome of 
the meeting, Khan and DeHuff were 
beaten 6-3, 5-7, 6-2. Lowe and 
Smolens won their doubles match 
6-4, 6-3, as did Londergan and 
Stone, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.
On Saturday, Tech was at home 
to W&J on an overcast day. Sin
gles play was started, but before 
any matches had been decided, the 
rains came down. The meet, which
Bob Lowe Delivers A Strong Serve 
Against His W.8iJ* Foe
will be concluded at a later date, 
had Khan, DeHuff, and Smolens*'. 
leading in their individual match-' 
es.
The netmen are at home today 
against St. Francis, and will tra
vel to Allegheny on Saturday.
Seven preliminary heats will be 
run Friday morning, May 6, and 
the three fastest machines will 
race in the championship heat on 
Saturday morning. There will also 
be a consolation heat for 4th, 5th 
and 6th place. The races should 
be fast and close, as any of six 
or seven different buggies has a 
chance to take it all.
The biggest news in the sweep
stakes for this year is the course 
itself. A portion of the free roll 
or coasting course has been re
paved, from Westinghouse Pond to 
the Conservatory. In addition, the 
buggy chairmen are planning to 
fill in the worst holes in the push
ing hills. These improvements 
could provide for a new course 
record.
There are several new buggies 
for this years race. Kappa Sig
ma, formerly a top contender, 
plans to enter a new fiberglas ma
chine after several years absence 
from competition. 'Hieta Xi will run 
a new fiberglas and plywood buggy 
along with their 3.14. Delta 
Upsilon has scrapped both their 
old pushmobiles for a brand new 
design. Tau Delta Phi will have a 
radical bike, very low with small 
wheels, and their other bike from 
last year. Sigma Nu has modified 
the Lizard by use of an alumi
num tubular spaced frame and a 
sheet aluminum body cover.
Pi Kappa Alpha should be a 
contender with the reliable 
Shark, race-winning buggy in 
63, and the redesigned Tiger 
Shark. Beta Sigma Rho will go 
all out for the race and design 
trophies with the modified 69. 
Beta Theta Pi has added a fiber
