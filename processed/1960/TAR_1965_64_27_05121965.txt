CORE Pickets Form Line Before PKA Booth
by Sue Attinson and Liz Seley
Representatives of CORE picketed the Pi Kappa Alpha 
booth on the Midway late last Saturday afternoon during 
Carnival.The PKA booth displayed a black-face minstrel scene 
with two dominant statues. CORE protested that the painted 
faces of these figures were degrading to the Negro.
The organization referred to the*
Philadelphia Mummers incident 
and that court ruling that shows 
which mimic the black-2ace minlstrel presentation are illeagl.
The CORE protest was voiced 
originally by seven representatives 
who came to the PKA fraternity 
house around midnight on Friday.
According to fraternity members, 
these individuals were both adult 
and teenage, wrhite and Negro.

(continued on page 8)
Earle R. Swank, dean of men, 
about the visitation. Dean Swank 
suggested that PKA paint the 
faces white. The fraternity com
plied with his suggestion.
At 10:30 a.m. on Saturday, 
George K. Brown, dean of student 
affairs, spoke with a representa
tive from CORE about the matter 
of repainting the faces. Accord
ing to Dean Brown, the represen
tative reluctantly agreed.
Said Dean Brown, I pointed 
out to him that there was no in
tent on the part of PKA to ridi
cule.
Saturday afternoon, someone 
unauthorized in PKA painted one 
j of the faces black. According to 
i PKA president, Leroy Gunner, 
j CORE knew about it before I 
| did. CORE representatives, ob! jecting to the booth, came onto 
j campus to picket.
According to Dean Brown, Mrs.
! Thelma Jackson, spokeswoman 
1 for the pickets said that she had 
j orders to close the booth.
She told a Tartan reporter that 
he (referring to the area head of 
CORE) gave me orders to come 
out here at five oclock.
When asked about the 13 other 
picketers, she explained that they 
were volunteers who wanted: to 
come out. She called the protest 
a spur-of-the-moment event." 
The others would answer no ques
tions.
Members of the administration, 
in order to avoid trouble, or
dered PKA to close down their 
booth and asked the pickets to 
leave. The picket line was dis
persed at about 8:20 p.m.
Dean Brown was informed that 
he would receive a letter explain
ing CORES official protest.
This is a model of the proposed 
schedule as it would look for 
1965-66:

Commencement
The administration studentfaculty calendar committee for
mulated this schedule so that it 
would provide what they felt to 
be educational benefits and 
change.s.
According to the new schedule, 
classes would start a week later 
and enrollment a week earlier 
than they presently do. Prominent 
features of the proposed calendar 
include the elimination of a form
al examination schedule and a 
semester break vacation.
It is felt that individual in
structors could schedule exams 
during the last week of classes 
to substitute for finals.
If this calendar is accepted 
there will be, according to Vernon 
Leicht, student representative on 
the Calendar Committee, an addi
tional one day spring vacation. It 
could be either on Good Friday, 
on the Thursday before Spring 
Carnival (no Carnival activities 
allowed  only preparation) or 
on another Monday or Friday in 
spring to give an additional 3-day 
vacation. In years where Easter 
comes in late March or early 
April, the spring vacation may 
encompass them both.
Also, a system may be worked 
out whereby students in continu
ous courses such as calculus, departmentals, etc., would simply 
receive a pass or fail in Feb
ruary and have a final mark at 
the end of the year.
Failing students would be al
lowed to continue the followuixg 
semester, providing that the failed 
courses be made up by taking 
final exams later on.
The Academic AfTiirs commit
tee will take these aspects of the 
schedule into consideration and 
act.

Page 4  CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN  Wednesday, May 12, 1965
EditorialThanks!
Dr. John L. Minard recently announced his resignation 
(effective June 1) as director of the Carnegie Tech Student 
Health Services. Said Mr. Minard: My private practice is 
getting so big now that I am forced to give up my position at 
Carnegie Tech.
The Tartan would like to take this opportunity to re
view the Health Service and the outstanding work of Dr. 
Minard.
As director of Carnegie Techs health services, Dr. 
Minard has held regular office hours, from 2 to 4 p.m., at 
the gym health department suite. He has treated on the aver
age 40 students per day. He has been responsible for the de
partments administrative work and has made the rounds 
of the Morewood infirmary and Shadyside Hospital.
Since September 1, 1963, when the doctor assumed his 
position at Carnegie Tech, the student health services and 
facilities have been expanded and modernized.
According to George K. Brown, dean of student affairs: 
There has been a definite improvement in our health ser
vices and Dr. Minard has been largely responsible .... We 
hate to lose him.
Under Dr. Minards direction, infirmary facilities with 
round-the-clock nursing service, were installed in Morewood 
Gardens for both men and women. Previously there were no 
infirmary facilities available for men.
Also, at Dr. Minards suggestion, the physical layout of 
the health service was changed. Three examining rooms were 
furnished to increase efficiency. One of these rooms is 
used by Dr. Lucille M. Koehler, the physician to women, 
during her office hours.
In addition to the three examining rooms, the health 
offices now contain a consultation room, laboratory, a physio
therapy room, and an X-ray room.
Thus, through Dr. Minards dedication and guidance, 
Carnegie Techs Health service has undergone substantial 
improvement. The Tartan extends to him its thanks for his 
outstanding service, and wishes him the best of luck in the 
future.Student AdvocatesU.S. Asian Policy

Today, Southeast Asia in gen
eral, and South Viet Nam in par
ticular, is in a very chaotic situ
ation.
The Administration this week 
committed some 6,600 Americans 
in Viet Nam for the purpose of 
obtaining peace and order in that 
country. Peace and order being, 
I feel, a fair generalization of the 
administrations stated aims.
These men bring the total num
ber of American troops in Viet 
Nam to 41,900 (the figures are 
from the May 6 New York Times 
and not, I might add, from the 
front page).
From the various arguments 
presented lately, advocating U.S. 
withdrawal from Viet Nam, one 
might gather that the above men
tioned action would meet with 
severe disapproval from abroad. 
However, S.E.A.T.O. just gave its 
approval of U.S. policy in Viet 
Nam my a vote of 7 to 0. (May 7 
New York Times).
I will admit that this kind of 
support is not prevalent among 
the majority outside of Washing
ton and Southeast Asia. On the 
other hand, the only serious de
mands for U.S. withdrawal seem 
to come from Communist nations 
and various groups of U.S. college 
students.
These people tend to feel that 
U.S. withdrawal will solve all the 
problems in that area of the world.
I am among the group that dis
agrees with these people.
The consequences of a U.S. 
withdrawal would be exceeding
ly disasterous. Faith in U.S. 
commitments around the world 
would be shattered past all hope 
1 reconciliation.
There is also the domino 
theory that is, that Viet Nam 
would be a stepping stone in the 
Chinese Communst advance. It is 
Chinas stated aim to put as much 
territory as possible under Chinese 
Communist control, and there is. 
no reason for China to stop when 
Viet Nam becomes Communist.
However, the question seems to 
be, how much control will China 
havfr over Ho Chi Minh? I tend
to feel that the Chinese will exert 
as much control as they want to 
seeing as how they claim South
east Asia is a traditional sphere of 
Chinese influence.
Then there is the belief express
ed by Secretary of Defense McNamarra, that Viet Nam is a test 
case being used by Communists 
to see how effective this type of 
warfare is in taking over a coun
try (McNamara press conference, 
April 28).
It is a principle taught by the 
U.S. Army Special Warfare 
school, Fort Bragg, N.C., that a 
guerilla force cannot completely 
take over a country. In order to 
gain complete control, one must 
employ conventional methods. 
Thus, in order to gain complete 
victory, a guerilla force must ev
entually transform into a conven
tional force. So far history has 
shown this principle to be true. 
Furthermore, it is pretty certain 
that the various potential aggres
sors of the world are watching 
with much interest to see how 
much success the Viet Cong is 
having against the mighty U.S. 
Air Force, Army and Marines. 
Thus it is logical to conclude that 
a U.S. withdrawal would encour
age aggression.
It should be mentioned that 
there is another side to the Spe
cial Warfare schools principle. 
That is, that it is eqvally as hard 
for the conventional troops op
posing the guerillas to achieve 
complete victory as it is for the 
guerillas to achieve this complete 
victory. This seems to be evidenc
ed by the recent stepped up Viet 
Cong operations.
There is, however, a recent example of a successful counter
guerilla operation. A few years 
ago, around the time of the Bay of 
Pigs fiasco, Castro successfully 
defeated the U.S. supported guer
illas operating in Cuba. These 
guerilla were supported by us in 
much the same way as Red China 
and North Viet Nam support the 
Viet Cong. Something to think 
about.
So if we arent winning, why

stay in Viet Nam? The answer 
is that we arent really losing, 
yet. Our troops are buying us 
time, time to find an agreeable 
solution or to let one develop.
Some people will argue that this 
solution is costly in both lives and 
money. Maybe so, but the lives 
weve lost in Viet Nam (around 
500) in the past ten years is less 
than we lost during some days in 
Korea.
As for as the money goes, for 
every dollar we pour into the 
effort against the Viet Cong, the 
Communists have to pour their 
Roubles and Chinese Yen; can 
they afford it? Also, if they 
werent occupied in Viet Nam, Im 
sure they could find other equally 
devastating outlets for their ef
forts.
So I maintain that the U.S. 
should continue to oppose the 
Communists in Viet Nam until 
a more agreeable solution can 
be found.

Spring Carnival Attacked 
For Adolescent Activities
Editor, the Tartan:
Perhaps one of the main rea
sons for the apathy towards Spring 
Carnival activities this year, like 
in previous years, is that students 
here are bored with the same activties, year in, year out.
Too many of the Spring Car- * 
nival events do not cater to col
lege students, but to the many 
high school and grade school kids 
who frequent the campus, espe
cially during the big weekends. I 
do not believe that the students 
at CIT are that immature, and that 
they actually enjoy watching 
events like the sorority relays, 
riding a merry-go-round, and 
throwing wet sponges at the faces 
of other students in a midway 
booth. The booths themselves 
have become stale, one being a 
stereotype of any other.
The only events which still ap
peal to most of the students are 
the buggy races, and perhaps one 
or two of the money events, i.e., 
the Friday night concert, the Sat
urday night formal dance, and 
this year the dance on the tennis 
courts on Saturday afternoon.
But then prices are extravagant, / 
particularly if a person does not 
want to attend all these social 
occasions. $7.50 per couple for the 
Friday night concert is as expen
sive as a concert by better single 
singers or groups of singers per
forming in the Syria Mosque, 
where the audibility and accoustics far exceed those of the Gym 
at Tech.
I suggest that Student Con
gress conduct a survey on cam
pus to find out the tastes and 
interests of the students for a 
big weekend like Spring Car
nival Fall Festival.
In view of past experience with 
surveys or polls, this should not 
be done by waiting for students 
to bring this information to them, 
but by going door-to-door in all 
the dorms and by sending letters - 
to communters. After this is done, 
Student Congress could draw 
plans for four of five more differ
ent weekends, to provide a bit of 
variety during the four years of 
undergraduate studies.

Performers, Not WRCT,' 
Caused Carnival Confusion
Editor, the Tartan:
There seems to have been a 
misconception as to who was re
sponsible for delays cn two major 
,-^vents this past weekend.
The delayed start of the Chad 
Mitchell Trio performance was 
due to the last-rininute installation 
of a followspot requested at the 
last minute by the performers; the 
facilities provided by WRCT met 
the specifications in the Mitchell 
Trio contract and wculd have 
been adequate.
** The other delay, the Bo Diddley 
dance on the tennis courts, re
sulted from a lack of power for 
the electric guitars and not from 
a failure of the WRCT equipment. 
No one had bothered to request 
power on the tennis courts be
forehand.
WRCT has done its best to 
t serve Spring Carnival; I think 
k'fchat with the above misconcep
tions cleared up, most people will 
agree that we did a more than 
adequate job this year.

Editor, the Tartan:

most deserving praise.
It is unfortunate that the re
viewer can see only the finished

the final realization of these must 
go to director-choreographer, Lar^ry Miller.

Music Breaks Peace 
Of Campus Stillness
Editor, the Tartan:
Et in Arcadia KQV?
Twilight. Lights begin to blink 
on in the graving mist around the 
hill. Birds chatter rapidly their 
last lyrical messages of the day, 
then their sounds die away to 
faint peeps as they settle un
willingly down for the night. A 
<$few clouds huddle close to one 
another, for solace perhaps in the 
vast emptiness of the graying sky. 
The vapor lamps blink open their 
blue-white eyes and peer down 
at the darkening capus. The 
light seeping out from under their 
heavy lids submerges the walks 
with the cold illumination of 
modern ingenuity. Far across the 
lawn a traffic light commandingly 
flashes red only to relent and 
9 hesitantly turn green again.
Then suddenly, sinfully, the 
sounds of nature in her night
gown restlessly settling into the 
cool blue-black satin sheets of 
night are replaced by loud rasp
ing gasping glaring sounds of 
man. From fraternity row echoes 
in muddied desibles the grating 
music of the funlovers; the earscplitting thumps and heart beat 
rhythms of thoughless surging 
yearning man. supplanting na
tures nighttime melodies with the 
ritual tatoo of sublimated sex, its 
artless mind-dulling beats oozing 
into every pore of quietness. Can 
there be no quiet corner on this 
campus where one might listen 
to the growing grass?

Changes On CampusComp Center Gives Versatility To CIT
AFS Chooses
2 Chaperones
by Cindy Mors
by Sue Attinson and Howard Weiss
Realizing that Carnegie Techs goal in engineering and 
science research and education could not be attained without 
the use of computers, the school established the Computation 
Center in 1956. This collection of people and equipment pro
vides computer facilities for Carnegie Tech faculty and stu
dents.
Most of the computer equipment 
is located on the 4th floor of 
Scaife Hall. There are 30 teletype 
machines located around campus. 
The center is in the process of 
supplementing the teletypes with 
the installation of 16 data phones 
directly linked to the main com
puters.
The major equipment consists of 
two large computers capable of 
performing arithmetic operations 
at the rate of 100,000 additions 
per second: the Control Data
Corporations G21 and IBMs 7040; 
the Control Data Corporations 
G15, used for electrical engineer
ing research; and two Control Data 
Corporations G20s.
The facilities are available for 
use 24 hours a day, every day of 
the year.
Any Carnegie Tech graduate, 
undergraduate, or faculty member 
may apply for a usage number at 
the Computation Center. This 
year there have been an estimated 
300 to 1000 active users.
In addition to providing com
puter problem-solving services for 
Carnegie Tech faculty and stu
dents, the purpose of the computer 
program is to conduct research 
and provide courses in computer 
usage.
The present G20s by next fall 
will have a total of 600 million 
characters of additional storage 
linked to them and will have a 
maximum access time of 425 
milliseconds to reach any bit of 
information.
Presently they have 8 magnetic 
tape units each 3600 feet long. The 
card reader has a capacity of 800 
cards a minute and the 2 line 
printers can each print 1000 lines 
a minute.
In Octobcr 1966 the Computa
tion Center plans to install a com
puter which will operate 15 times 
faster than the present old ma
chine.
Marcia Israel, junior, and John 
Missimer. junior, math, have been 
chosen by the American Field 
Service as bus chaperones for the 
AFS foreign exchange students 
this summer.
Each will be in charge of a 
bus of 40 students who have spent 
the past year in American high 
schools. They will tour one area 
of the United States in an all
expense paid trip.
The other bus chaperones will 
be college students from all over 
the country who have completed 
their junior year.
They were interviewed by AFS 
returnee groups in colleges, and 
then selected by AFS in New 
York.
Miss Israel and Missimer are 
both affiliated with the AFS chap
ter at Carnegie Tech. Missimer 
was once an exchange student in 
France.

The IBM 7040 is used mainly by 
the Physics Department for re
search. One of the computers, an 
IBM 1401 is used by management 
center to handle Carnegie Techs 
grades and salary computations. 
Also GSIA students use the center 
facilities for their management 
games. Yet, the majority of the 
computers work remains ordinary 
arithmetical calculations.
The Computer Center employs 
a research staff who study com
puter language, uses, and prob
lem-solving theories. They work 
under a 1.4 million dollar Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency 
contract. The agency is a branch 
of the Defense Department.
Undergraduate courses in com
puters, computer options in elec- j 
trical engineering and math, and j 
an introductory course in com- i 
puters, are available through the 
center. Approximately 150 stu- j 
dents per semester, from all de- ; 
partments on campus, have enroll
ed in the introductory course. j
The cost of maintaining the 
Computation Center has been in 
excess of one million dollars a 
year. A computer was first rented 
by the school in 1956.
In 1958 the National Science 
Foundation began to donate funds 
to American Universities. The 
foundation donated funds to Car
negie Tech in 1960. These funds 
provided for the increased com
puter capacity required by the 
.school. They also financed onehalf the cost of the G20 which 
was installed in 1961. -<

BPT Takes First Plate
In Carnival Buggy Rates
by Roger Powell
The Buggy Sweepstakes once again proved to be the highlight of the Spring Carnival 
activities. A large and enthusiastic crowd attended both the preliminary heats Friday 
morning and the final heats Saturday morning.
Although early morning showers threatened the event, the Friday races ran as sched
uled. In the first heat, BTPS 00 
broke the 2:30 barrier with a 
2:27.7. This eventually became the 
only time under 2:30 and was 
therefore the fastest heat of the 
day. In the second heat, BSR ran 
afoul of the rules in their ex
change between pushers 4 and 5 
and were disqualified. Also in 
heat two, the ATO Goose ne
gotiated the Frew Street turn 
without incident for the second 
fastest time of 2:31.77.
In heat five, TDP ran out of 
its lane and also had a pacer in 
the neighborhood of hill one. The 
Delts were therefore eventually 
disqualified. Heat seven saw SNs 
design entry record a 2:58.5, plac
ing it in the bottom half and out 
of the design competition.
On the basis of Fridays prelim
inary heats, the lineup for Satur
days finals was determined. The 
second three fastest times on Fri
day were turned in by the PKA 
Shark, the PKA Tiger Shark. 
and the SAE Bike. SAE swept 
the consolation heat on Saturday 
and took the fourth place trophy.
The two PKA buggies finished in 
a dead heat for fifth and sixth 
places.

Preliminaries
The three finalists were the 
ATO Goose, ihe BTP 00, and 
the BTP 000. BTPs 00 and 
000 finished first and third, re
spectively, while ATOs entry 
took second.
In design competition, BTPs 
00 again took top honors with 
444 points out of a possible 500. 
The ATO Goose was second 
again with 410 points. Thlus BTP 
and ATO entered vehicles which 
were tops from both design and 
speed standpoints.
All twenty entries passed the 
safety requirements to qualify for 
the races. Another surprise was 
that the Dorm 5 buggy was 
able to better the times of half of 
the fraternity entries. Last year 
the Dorm entrv finished dead last.

and sixth places are held by

Bugiy design trophies were

The Honda door prize was won 
by George Rangos, freshman,

far, and all are in a position to 
take first in their league.
Ideals Top Cards League
The Ideals are in front in the 
Cards league by virtue of their 
4-0 record;  They should take 
the second place E.J.s in their 
last game to end w7ith an un
blemished record. At the moment 
the E.J.s are in second place 
with a 3-1 record, but they could 
be pushed out by SAE, DU, or 
GSIA B, each of whom has lost 
two games so far. During this past 
week the E.J.s topped the last 
place Organization team.
The Grad Eagles are leading the 
Yanks league with a 4-0 record, 
but right behind them is ATO 
with a 3-0 record. These two 
teams will almost surely finish 
first and second, but its anybodys 
guess as to which will take first 
place. This past week saw ATO 
crush the Finks.
In the Sox league BSR A is 
in the lead with a 3-0 record, but 
is followed closely by the Chem 
Grads with a 3-1 record and by 
Trips to Win and KS with 2-1 
records. As can be seen, anything 
can happen to the standings in 
this league. During the past week 
KS handed the Trips to Win its 
first defeat and the Chem Grads 
beat last place SN B.
GSIA F Leads Reds League
The Reds league is also a big 
question mr-rk with GSIA F 
leading with a 3-0 record followed
Although action was limited 
last week due to Spring Car
nival, this weeks action will be 
hot and heavy. Among the 
games to watch this week is to
nights contest between first 
place ideals and second place 
E.J.s and Fridays battle be
tween ATO and the Grad 
Eagles. The quarter finals are on 
Saturday and the semi-finals on 
Monday. The championship 
game and the consolation game 
will be played next Tuesday. AH 
games scheduled for tomorrow 
will be postponed, until Friday 
due to the I.M. track meet, 
which will begin at 4:30.
