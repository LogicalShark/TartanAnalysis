Jake Bids Tech
Farewell After
Thirty-Nine Years
Dr. Horton Guyford Stever, educator, administrator, 
and one of this countrys foremost aeronautical experts, 
has been named as fifth president of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. Dr. Stever will succeed Dr. J. C. Warner, 
who retires after fifteen years-as head of the Pittsburgh 
institution.
In making the announcement, 
Mr. James M. Bovard, chairman 
of the board at Carnegie Tech, 
said, Our long and intensive 
search for a man to succeed Dr. 
Warner has paid the highest div
idends. In Dr. Stever, we have 
found a dynamic young man 
who is experienced and knowl
edgeable in education, adminis
tration, and governmental affairs. 
To Dr. Warner, we give our pro
found thanks for a magnificent 
job in providing the impetus and 
leadership which has hastened 
Carnegie Techs progress to
ward a national university of 
excellent quality.
Mr. Bovard made the an
nouncement following a meet
ing of the board of trustees on 
the Carnegie Tech campus this 
afternoon. Dr. Stever will start 
spending time at Tech as soon 
as personal and professional 
commitments allow and will of
ficially assume the presidency 
on February 1, 1965.
For Dr. Warner, the announce
ment climaxes 39 years of serv
ice to the university beginning 
in 1926 when he ]oined the fac
ulty as an instructor in chem
istry.
Presently head of the depart
ments of mechanical engineer
ing, and naval architecture and 
marine engineering at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, Dr. Stever, 47, comes to 
Carnegie Tech with an unusual 
background in educational, ad
ministrative, and governmental 
affairs. He holds a B. A. degree 
from Colgate University, a pre
dominately liberal arts institu
tion where he was elected to Phi 
Beta Kappa, and has his Ph.D. in 
physics from California Institute 
of Technology.
Commenting on his selection 
as the new president of Car
negie Tech, Dr. Stever said, I 
feel deeply honored at having 
been asked to guide the progress 
of one of this countrys leading 
centers of education and re
search. With the foundation al
ready provided by Techs dis
tinguished faculty under Dr. 
Warners leadership, I am con
fident that Carnegie Techs 
future in liberal-professional ed
ucation will continue to grow 
and to be in the forefront of 
higher education. I am hopeful 
that I can provide the kind of 
leadership that Tech has had in 
the past and that is so vital to 
an institution in todays educa
tionally-oriented society.
Born in Corning, New York, 
Dr. Stever joined M. I. T. in 
1941 as a staff member of the 
radiation laboratory. During the 
war, he served as Scientific Liai 
son Officer, London Mission, for 
the Office of Scientific Research 
and Development, in work on 
radar and guided missiles. He 
returned to M. I. T. in 1946 as 
assistant professor and executive 
officer of the guided missiles pro
gram of the institution. Since 
1956, he has been professor 
of aeronautics and astronautics, 
and from 1956-59, served as as
sociate dean of engineering.
In 1955-56, Dr. Stever was 
chief scientist, United States Air 
Force, and since 1961 he has 
been chairman of the Scientific 
Advisory Board to the Secretary 
and Chief of Staff of the Air 
Force. He was chairman of a 
special committee on space tech
nology and now is a member of 
the Research Advisory Commit
tee, Missile and Space Vehicle 
Aerodynamics, for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA). Dr. Stever holds 
memberships on the Defense 
Scientific Board and the Ad
visory Panel of the U. S. House 
of Representatives Committee on 
Science and Astronautics. He is a 
Fellow of the American Acad
emy of Arts and Sciences, the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, the 
American Physical Society, the 
American Institute of Aeronau
tics and Astronautics, and the 
Royal Aeronautical Society, 
Great Britain, and is a trustee of
Colgate University. Dr. Stever is 
the recipient of the "Presidents 
Certificate of Merit, the Excep
tional Civilian Service Award, 
of the Air Force, and the Scott 
Gold Medal, from the American 
Ordnance Association.
Dr. Warner, commenting on 
the selection of Dr. Stever as his 
successor, said, I am highly 
pleased that a person with the 
many qualifications of Dr. Stever 
has been chosen to guide Car
negie Tech into what promises 
to be its most exciting and chal
lenging years. His presence on 
the campus will insure, I think, 
that the momentum generated at 
Tech will be continued and ac
celerated, and the institution 
will grow in excellence among 
the countrys private colleges 
and universities. I am also con
vinced that Dr. Stever recog
nizes the importance and the 
value of close ties between Car
negie Tech and the Pittsburgh 
community.
During Dr. Warners adminis
tration, Carnegie Tech has ex
perienced its greatest educa
tional and.physical growth. The 
retiring presidents achievements 
include the introduction to the 
Tech campus of the interdiscip
linary approach to education 
which has become widely used 
throughout the United States; 
the start of Techs computation 
center which has achieved na
tional recognition as one of the 
finest in the country; the begin
ning of the advanced placement 
program with Pittsburgh area 
high schools which has been re
ported on and supported on a 
national level; and the formation 
of Techs Graduate School of In
dustrial Administration, which, 
in fourteen years, has become 
recognized as a pioneer and in
novator in industrial administra
tion education.
Physically, since Dr. Warner 
became president, fourteen new 
buildings have been constructed 
and Carnegie Techs endowment 
and value of the physical plant 
have doubled. In addition, the 
retiring president has raised fac
ulty salaries over 100% during 
his term. The development pro
gram, which began in 1957 with 
a goal of $29,000,000, has al
ready raised $26,000,000 of that 
total.
Educated at Indiana Univer
sity, Dr. Warner came to Car
negie Tech in 1926 and quickly 
went through the ranks becom
ing professor and head of the de
partment of chemistry, a position
.-IP'i '-rDr. John Christian Warner
he held until 1949 when he was 
appointed vice president and 
president-elect. He also served 
as dean of graduate studies from 
1945 to 1950.
Dr. Warner has served the 
government as a member of the 
Manhattan Project from 1943- 
45, a member of the General Ad
visory Committee of the United 
States Atomic Energy Commis
sion from 1952 to 1964, and he is 
a member of the Policy Advisory 
Board of the Argonne National 
Laboratory. In 1958, he attended 
the Second U. N. International 
Conference on Peaceful Uses
of Atomic Energy, in Geneva, 
Switzerland, as a technical con
sultant to the U. S. delegation. 
Recently Dr. Warner has been 
active as a consultant to the Ford 
Foundation studying education
al problems in Southeast Asia.
He is the recipient of eleven 
honorary degrees and a trustee 
or director of many corporations 
and organizations. He is also a 
member of the National Acad
emy of Sciences, past-president 
of the American Chemical So
ciety, and recipient of the Gold 
Medal of the American Institute
