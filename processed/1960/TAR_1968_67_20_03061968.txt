Baim Discusses Lawrence In English Lecture Series
by BILL
Joseph Baim is one of the 
bright young men of Carnegies 
English Department, highly re
spected by both his students and 
colleagues. A graduate of Al
fred University, Dr. Baim re
ceived his M.A. and Ph.D. from 
Syracuse. His doctoral disserta
tion was on BaimDamis cu aes 
BeLia BaLicsw Lr nI EI glhisuDsI
Last Tuesday in the Carnegie 
Theatre, Dr. Baim delivered the 
second of the English Depart
ments lectures in the series, 
Significant Literary Figures of 
the 20th Century. His subject 
was D. H. Lawrence as a social 
philosopher  his theme Man 
Doth Not Live by Man Alone.
Standing before the impres
sive tiLScJlo set which he de
scribed as nicely Lawrentian, 
Baim spoke in a warm, articu
late manner which commanded 
his listeners attention. He be
gan with an ennumerating of 
Lawrences literary accomplish
ments. His great novels, BLuw

stories, The Blind Man, The 
Horse-Dealers Daughter and 
The Rocking-Horse Winner 
are also very popular. Even the 
once prohibited glS0 velaasi 
leys gLpsi is widely accepted 
now that professons are able to 
look beyond the overtones into 
the true merit of the novel.
As Baim pointed out, Law
rences literary ability is indis
puted, it is his social vision 
which is most quickly dismiss
ed. The venerable Bertrand RusseQl has denounced the clear, 
ugly and dangerous fascistic 
overtones of his writings and 
warned against the implications 
of his emphasis on the emotion
al, sexual nature of man.
Another critic, John Strachey, 
has accused Lawrence of evol
utionary socialism and class 
consciousness. Strachey points 
out the typical theme of a vig
orous, young worker thrown 
into an affair with a previously 
sexually unawakened artistocratic woman bound up in the af
fairs of the governing class. 
Strachey was later to amend 
these criticisms and dismissed 
Lawrences work as a rather 
amateurish sort of sexual mys
ticism.
To understand Lawrence as 
a philosopher it is necessary to 
understand him as a man. He 
distrusted all obstractions, in 
situations and political systems. 
In an essay Apocalyse, he said,

Comments on the Passing Scene
The Pittsburgh teachers strike goes on as we write this. 
Future teachers on this campus take note.
a Dr. Sidney Marland, Director of the Board of Public Edu
cation, is among the six highest paid public school administra
tors in the country Pittsburgh teachers are approximately six
teenth on a national pay scale.
Pittsburgh police earn between $5900 and $6400 as starting 
salary. Refuse collectors earn more than that. Teachers are 
paid a starting salary of $5,900, and yet they must assume the 
duties of policemen and take a lot of garbage from the School 
Board.
We were standing outside Hunt Library last Sunday at 2 
PM waiting for the doors to open or for us to freeze, which
ever would occur first. The fifteen or so of us there were re
marking about the fact that the library was the only building 
on campus which is really for students. And then somebody 
remembered the Penthouse.
The administration was approached last week with pro
posals for the rebuilding of Skibo until a new student union 
is constructed. Among the requests was the novel idea that the 
school should set up a trust fund for the specific purpose of 
renovating the building. This would show that the adminis
tration was bargaining in good faith. 1 he request was, of course, 
denied.
We have been lax in congratulating the officers of our 
security patrol for their quick work in handling a potential 
fire in Hunt Library a few weeks back. The security men were 
on the scene within three or four minutes after they were called.
CONFAB and the Thursday Luncheon Forum last week pro
vided interesting and pertinent information on the atttitudes 
and needs of the Black Man in Pittsburgh. Dr.Trellis of the 
Hill Mental Health Team commented that people who are in
terested in working with the Black people in Pittsburgh should 
not attempt to take the approach of going to the Hill once a 
week for two or three hours. Ed Ellis stated that the Black 
Man must attain a state of Black Consciousness, and that to 
accomplish that goal, Whitev must be made to understand that 
he is wanted only as a counselor in areas where the Black 
community cannot carry out a specific task.
The YMWCA Office, Room 57, Skibo, has an interesting 
article entitled nsomwcLuw Lr aes ecas gcCsilo on hand for 
distribution. We suggest that Intensely Interested Whites and 
White Liberals pick up a copy. Also slated for distribution is 
an article entitled bes BamSsua lw Nigger, by nuIIE barber.
The Student Food Management Committee was surprised 
recently to learn that food prices had been raised in Skibo and 
Morewood. Talk about Credibility Gaps.
KDKA-TV has taken a novel approcah to program plan
ning. Tom Seger, producer-direct or of Weekend Two,  has in
stituted an advisory panel composed of students from the vari
ous Pittsburgh colleges. The panel advises him on topics for 
the program as well as approaches to those topics.
The Pittsburgh Press, in its treatment of local issues, has 
once again proven itself to be one of the most misinformed publicativns existent.

Food Price Rise 
Distributed Unevenly
Editor, bes blialuq
With the beginning of the 
Spring semester, the students 
who eat in the Skibo cafeteria 
and snack bar saw an increase 
in the price of food go into ef
fect. This week a similar raise 
in prices was put into effect at 
the Morewood Gardens Cafe
teria. This increase raises the 
cost of a meal, on the average, 
ten to 20 per cent. In the blialu 
a few weeks ago, this was re
ported as due to an increase in 
the cost of food. Assuming that 
it is the actual reason, such an 
increase in prices was justified. 
Unfortunately these higher 
prices were instituted in such a 
manner that only some of the 
students who eat on campus are 
effected by the increase. If the 
increase was caused by higher 
food prices, al students who 
eat in Skibo and Morewood 
should have to pay more. In
stead of all paying more, only 
those who pay cash have been 
effected. The students who eat 
on the board plan (the so-called 
contract) will eat the same 
food at the same price they pay
ed last semester. To those who 
pay cash, the same amount of 
food costs ten or 20 per cent 
more than it did in the fall.
The fault in Food Services ac
tion probably lies in their an
nouncing the price increase a 
month after the bills for the 
spring semester were sent out. 
They could have rectified their 
failing to increase the price of 
board by limiting the amount of 
food a student on contract may 
take by ten or 20 per cent. How
ever, nothing of this sort has 
taken place.
While it would be considered 
foolish to ask for the price in
crease to be revoked, Food Serv
ice should reconsider its act and 
try to find a way that it effects 
all students.

Lawrence
BaimDsmcue fIiJ Lwru 1) 
rejected democratic, communis
tic, fascistic and paternalistic 
states and called for a return to 
community - life, governed by 
leaders of the highest quality.
Lawrence saw men bound to 
ugliness in surroundings, ideals, 
religion, hope, love, clothes, fur
niture, houses and relationships. 
He saw the 20th century as 
mans evolution into "amiable 
machines.
The cause of this cynicism 
and distrust was Lawrences 
childhood in industrial England 
and its grine and hardships. He 
saw what happened to men and 
families first hand under the 
rigorous strife of that period. 
He later viewed World War I 
as the preverse, psychotic man
ifestation of the represession of 
mans ability to live a full life. 
Men do feel, he said, but they 
feel falsely and are deceived.
What does Lawrence suggest? 
In sexual experience he sees 
the immediate, non-mental 
knowledge of divine otherness 
brought to a focus. He calls 
for a harmony between the body 
and the mind. Lawrence sought 
to restore the natural flow of 
warm sympathy between man 
man, man and woman. Lastly, 
alive at a moment when the 
he relied upon physical aware
ness to keep us tender and 
great danger is to go brittle, 
hard, and in some way dead.
Through the work of scholars 
like Dr. Baim, modern readers 
are able to recognize David Her
bert Lawrence for what he real
ly was: neither a sexual per
vert nor a fascist radical, but a 
real lover of human experience 
and an avid enthusiast of man 
in his struggle against the re
strictive modem world. He was, 
as H. T. Moore described him, 
a man obsessed not with sex 
but with life.

Panel Discussion 
on Student Power
n BvEjyb
Ed Schwartz, president of the 
National Student Association, 
will be present on campus Tues
day, March 12, at 11:30 am in 
the Wherrett Room. He will 
participate in a panel discussion 
on Student Power as part of 
the series of seminars in the 
Alienation and Identity Symposi
um, sponsored by the Office of 
Religious Affairs.
Mr. Schwartz is 24 years old 
and a graduate of Oberlin with 
a major in Government. He has 
been active in protest move
ments at Oberlin, NYU, Berke
ley, St. Johns University and at 
several other schools. He was 
National Affairs vice-president 
of USNSA before being elected 
president of that organization 
in the Summer of 1967.
Other members of the panel 
are Gordon Cohen, editor of the 
becwaos" Dale Pesohel, president 
of Student Government; Gene 
Payne, a senior AMS student; 
and George Madaras, a graduate 
student in Psychology. Len 
Wanetik, editor of the blialuf 
will act as moderator.
The concept of student pow
er has been defined as an at
tempt by the students to devel
op effective political identities in 
a politically absurd worldin 
effect, an attempt to deal with 
a feeling of alienation. The 
composition of the panel should 
enable a wide range of views to 
be presented both the means 
and the ends of the student pow
er movement.
Members of the university 
community are invited to at
tend.

Mr. Schwartz will also speak 
at a Free University Forum

Both lost on campus, 2/26.
If you don't agree that business destroys individuality, maybe it's because you're an individual.
Theres certain campus talk that claims 
individuality is dead in the business world. 
That big business is a big brother destroy
ing initiative.
But freedom of thought and action, when 
backed with reason and convictions cour
age, will keep and nurture individuality 
whatever the scene: in the arts, the sciences, 
and in business.
Scoffers to the contrary, the red corpus
cles of individuality pay off. No mistake.
Encouraging individuality rather than 
suppressing it is policy in a business like 
Western Electricwhere we make and provide things Bell telephone companies need. 
Because communications are changing fast, 
'hese needs are great and diverse.
Being involved with a system that helps 
keep people in touch, lets doctors send car
diograms across country for quick analysis, 
helps transmit news instantly, is demand
ing. Demanding of individuals.
If your ambition is strong and your abili
ties commensurate, youll never be truly 
happy with the status quo. Youll seek 
ways to change it andwonderful feeling!

GUT ISSUES
WHERE THE ACTION IS
DRAMATIC REVOLUTION
FEDERAL SCHOOL REPORT says: The Phila
delphia public schools are engaged in the most dramatic 
revolution in a city school system in the post-war period.
Reform in Philadelphia is more widespread and far-reaching 
than in any large school system in the country."
DR. MARK R. SHEDD, new Superintendent of Schools, says:
I will continue to support teachers who are able to examine, in a 
mature way, the gut issues of our daywar, sex, race, drugs, poverty.
If we divorce school subjects from the guts and hopes of human beings, 
we can expect students to find them gutless and hopeless."
RICHARDSON DILWORTH, President of the Board of Education,
says: The city is where the action is. Its where the challenge is. Its where 
we are facing the great moral and social issues of our day. If you want action, 
come teach in Philadelphia. If you dont, go teach in the suburbs.
WE SAY: Come join our school revolution as a teacher. Get in on the action. 
Teacher salaries are rising rapidly. So is our school system. Come on up the up stair
case. For further information, see our Representative who will be at Cqmegfe-Meflon 
University on TUESDAY, MARCH 19, ly6B.

Striking Teachers Demand Democratic Rights 
Higher Salaries, Better Working Conditions

Q2 budDcIuIU
At the time we go to press, 
the teachers strike will be six 
days old. Despite the extensive 
coverage on the part of the 
news media one gets the idea 
that the majority of the public 
has been and still remains gross
ly misinformed about the issues 
actually involved in the strike. 
This can be attributed in pact 
to an unfortunately poor ievel 
of press coverage Which has ob
scured some vital issues.
The real problem seems to be 
what Dr. Leonard Rapping calls 
distinguishing between the le
gal and economic aspects of the 
strike." The questions of wheth
er or not the School Board has 
the right to bar a strike by the 
teachers and to ask for an in
junction against picketing is one 
which requires a legal decision. 
On the other hand there is the 
problem of whether it is mean
ingful to give public employees 
the right to organize without 
giving them the right to strike.
A petition was circulated by 
the teachers which requested an 
election to determine who would 
represent them in collective bar
gaining . . . the Pittsburgh 
Teachers Education Association 
or the Pittsburgh Federation of 
Teachers. This petition was sign
ed by two-thirds of the teachers, 
which would indicate that the 
majority of the teachers in the 
city of Pittsburgh support in 
principle the move which is un
der way to gain the right to 
bargain collectively for higher 
salaries and better working con
ditions.

right of association, there is no 
doubt that teachers may form 
unions.
There is no doubt that the 
Board of Public Education may 
voluntary discuss mutual prob
lems with teacher groups. The 
hard questions arise when the 
Board declares that it will not 
recognize an exclusive teacher 
group. And of course the most 
difficult question arises when 
teachers withhold their services 
by striking.
Pennsylvania law prohibits 
strikes by public employees and 
its words expressly include school 
teachers. (Vol. 43, Purdons 
Pennsylvania Statutes, 215.1, 
passed in 1947.) This law has not 
been tested with respect to 
whether it is an unconstitutional 
deprivation of a fundamental 
right.
Events in the last few days 
have raised another fundamental 
question: may a court prohibit 
freedom of expression in the 
form of picketing where there 
is no present danger to the 
community. Judge Hester order
ed teachers not to strike. He 
may have also ordered that no 
one may strike at a public 
school. This is the interpreta
tion the police have put upon 
the order. Such a prohibition 
raises a clear question of free
dom of speech.
From all indications the posi
tion of the teachers has been 
strengthened, rather than weak
ened, by the strike. In talking 
with strikers at the Board of 
Education in Oakland on Mon
day morning and later that day 
at St. Casmirs School when 
Fondy spoke to a PFT gather
ing, one was most impressed by 
their positive attitude and high 
spirits.

which is unsatisfactory in that 
the cathartic effect of bargain
ing in good faith ot achieve a 
settlement is lacking, and be
cause it delegates wage setting 
power to an arbitratory; 3) Bet
ter sanctions(?) and 4) Creativ
ity. The last point is not an 
alternative, but it certainly is 
needed in this situation.
It is apparent from the reac
tions of the teachers to the de
mands of the School Board and 
other city groups that they con
sider themselves to be professi
onals, and that as members of 
an organized profession they 
should have certain democratic 
rights which they feel the School 
Board has been denying them. 
There was mention at St. Casimers of being held down by 
the Board's policies, and of strik
ing to gain respect for themselves and for their profession 
by being able to bargain for 
higher wages and better work
ing conditions.
The word respect seems to 
be the key to the attitude of the 
striking teachers. The Board 
considers the strike disrespect
ful, but as a sign which one 
demonstrator carried read: 
How can we lose respect we 
never had!

"I never feel like a rookie
Sure its my first year with B&W, but Ive been too 
busy to think about that. Ive been working in my field 
all along, and the training sort of blends right in.
If Randy Trost sounds like a B&W booster, you 
should hear what his supervisor says about him.
Were looking for aggressive, talented young engi
neers like Randy. We want ysu if you want significant 
responsibility from the start. In fact, we need more 
engineers than ever before. Thats because were grow
ing faster. Sales were $560 million last year. Up 17 
per cent.
Thats how its been from the beginning. We started 
out making steam generation equipment. That led to 
atomic power stations, nuclear marine propulsion 
equipment, refractories, specialty steel, machine tools, 
computers, and closed-circuit TV. (And we still make 
the best boiler in America )
If youd like to talk with Randy Trost about B&W, 
call him collect at our facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, 
jv 703 846-7371.
In the meantime, be on the lookout for the B&W 
recruiter when he visits your campus.

Sound of Money
... by TIMOTHY BAY
Elor l Bcx.suDs - following in the boxoffice footsteps of 
BLmuS Lr UmwcD - shows the sad contrast between the present 
day Hollywood musicial and the traditional Hollywood musical 
of the 40 s and 50 s. In an earlier era, effortless professionals 
like Gene Kelley and Fred Astaire created unpretentious, per
sonal and often highly imaginative lightweight entertainment. 
Their heritage: a number of fine American film classics Ybes 
2luS lJLuf Mu aes bLhuf ju j,sicDlu cu tlicwI
In contrast, Elor l Bcx.suDs - coming to Pittsburgh later 
this month - shows that lyrical camerawork, acres of ornamen
tal scenery and even larger amounts of setiment, do not make a 
successful! musical.
Sixpence is based on a novel by H. G. Wells. However, the 
story in its optimistic spirit is closer to Walt Disney. This poltvoung miliner s assistant s social rise in Edwardian Englena-is 
merely the pretext for an overwhelming amount of Production 
nos. vWith a mechanical energy and spontaneity, the character s 
constantly break out into song and dance - almost like a parody 
of musical comedy convention.
Tommy Steele works strenouslv and expertly in the prin
cipal role of Kipps; Julia Foster is fine as his lower class girl 
girlfriend; and Cvril Ritchard is perfect as a romantic embodi
ment of a ham actor. Also appearing in the film are harlequins, 
some beautiful English castles, armies of chorus girls, and a mar
vellous old fashioned .carousel.
Surprisingly, veteran Hollywood musical comedy director 
George Sydney overworks some already overused camera devices. 
A heroine is frequently viewed in soft focus - an effect which 
easily becomes ridiculous.
The music, with the exceptional of the likeable title song is 
bright, exuberant and forgetable. Sixpence in two and a half 
hours long, and even with an intermission it is much too long.
In line with my opening remarks unlike those earlier films, 
Half a Bcx.suDs totally lacks both charm and substance. For 
those who are interested, however, it does have enough pro
duction nos to supply Radio City Music hall for the next two 
decades and some of the no s although overelaborate, are quite 
nice.

Taking upon myself the role of publicist, I will say a few 
words about a subject that I am sure many people are curious 
about: The Beaux Arts Ball. The plans are still in the beginning 
stages; however a location has been decided upon and a pro
bable date arranged. It will be held during Spring Carnival. 
To clear up an important point: this event is not intended as a 
competition for Spring Carnival, but as an alternative. From 
my own experience , I know that most of the people who would 
go to a Beaux Art s Ball, would not ordinarily go to Spring 
Carnival. Held on a private estate in a huge tent, the three 
day affair would feature bands and a light show. On Saturday 
night there would probably be a masquerade party. Ticket sales 
are not limited to Fine Art s students; right now everybody s 
support is needed. The tradition of a Beaux Arts Ball should 
not die; hopefully next year it will be held in a more accus
tomed fashion in Fine Arts.
Lecture Hall Site 
Of Historic Event
For the past seven years Carnegie-Mellons Ceilidh Folk Mu
sic Society has provided the fo
cal point of Pittsburghs folk 
music interests. During the past 
years, together with the Pitts
burgh Folk-Lore Society, the Ceilidth has presented to the com
munity a series of outstanding 
and unusual concerts. They in
clude traditional music from 
England, Ireland, Scotland, Ap
palachia, Latin America and 
Negro Gospel, as well as some 
of our best revival performers. 
Among those presented were 
Doc Watson, The New Lost City 
Ramblers, Norman Kennedy, 
Lou Killen, Pete Seeger, Robert 
Schmertz, Vivian Richman and 
Carol Saunders.
The group has taken great 
care in brringmg to Pittsburgh 
the finest musicians from out
side the city. Now it is with 
great pride that they present the 
March 16th concert, which will 
bring together four of Pitts
burghs finest performers in 
what promises to be a memor
able event.
Dwayne Thorpe, a native of 
Kansas and former faculty 
member at C.I.T., has been re
cently presented in concert by 
Pete Seeger. He has also ap
peared in concert with Doc 
Watson, has sung to small au
diences thru-out the east coast, 
aand was one of the main stays 
of the Friday evening gather
ings at the ceilidth. He has a 
strong rich voice, and presents 
his music with sensitivitty and 
conviction.
Myra Elmers originally from 
South Carolina has lived in Pitts
burgh for many years, but has 
kept her song-bag of appalachian songs alive and vital. The 
songs of her childhood paint a 
rich picture of life in America. 
Mrs. Elmers accompanies her 
songs with the appalachian dul
cimer, a three stringed primitive 
American instrument.
Jo Davidson, a native Pitts
burgher, has sung folk songs for 
about fifteen years, and as a 
member of the Gateway Trio 
has made many appearances in 
the Pittsburgh area. He accom^ 
panies himself on banjo, guitar 
and dulcimer.
Richard Hughes, a natural 
musician, accompanies himself 
on guitar, mouth-harp, tin-whistle and flute. For many years
S n S Considering 
Broadway Show
It was announced today that 
Scotch and Soda has just com
pleted tentative plans to present 
a Broadway show on campus 
next fall. According to Presi
dent Len Alexander, the club 
is considering two shows for 
a November production date. 
This will in no way affect the 
Spring musical, he said, ra
ther, we hope the show will be
come another feature of Scotch 
and Sodas new format.
S 'n Soda is C-MUs musical 
theatre club, which each Spring 
produces a new musical written 
by C-MU students. Currently 
two new one-act musicals are in 
production for this Springs 
April 26 opening.
"In conjunction with S 'n S 
policy, Alexander continued, 
all aspects of the production 
will be handled by students. We 
are. however, considering the 
possibility of opening the pro
duction to allarea colleges. This 
would, in effect, provide a show
case for the best college talent 
in the Pittsburgh area.
Basic plans call for an arena 
style presentation }n the Skibo 
Ballroom with at least two per
formances and possibly a local 
tour. The two shows being con
sidered are 4i,l gl nLmDs and 
vliucploI Casting would occur 
in late May, with rehearsals to 
begin immediately following reg
istration next fall. Alexander in
dicated that final plans should 
be complete by early April and 
more information would Cs 
available then. We would wel
come student comments and 
suggestions on the idea, es 
added.
Underground Films 
Show Belgium Film
An award-winning program of 
Underground and Experimental 
Films will be presented Wed
nesday, March 13, in the Skibo 
Ballroom at C-MU. Heading the 
bill will be the film awarded 
second prize last month at the 
1968 Brussels International Film 
Festival, Jud Yalkuts Self-oblit
eration. The film begins with 
what was described in the 
judges dairy as a beautiful 
Japanese girl painting circles on 
her environment, and dissolves 
into a frantic orgy of psyche
delic bacchanal. In spite of its 
recognition by the Festival 
judges, the film was banned in 
Belgium and was assailed by 
the conservative press for its 
overly sexual subject matter.

oIicro Dou "ii7smr Cbwhh . . .
by TONY LAWRENCE
There appears to be a trend among film makers today, 
predominant in Europe, that stays clear of dealin - with the 
characters in the movie with any depth. Everything is handled 
on purely peripheral levels. This became quite apparent in Antonioi s 2oLhm.I 2oLhm. must certainly deals with its characters 
in a very basic way. But, it was also effective because we as
sume Antonioni was doing something worthwhile and a mes
sage was, though perhaps slightly distorted, evident. The kind 
of craftsmanship that Antonioni has is rare and very difficult 
to bring off. Instead many members of the new wave or new 
school make the film beautiful to look at and let it go at that. 
Lelouche is at fault at this in A Ulu luS A L,luI The film 
is naive, pretty, and has only a few good moments. The people 
seem too blase and lethargic. Two of the latest imports that fit 
into the above mentioned trend and category are opcil Ul 
ScJlu and voLwso0 laDesS bilcuwI
opcil UlScJlu is a Danish film written and directed by 
Bo Widerberg. Based upon an ancient folk legend, it deals 
with a young tight rope walker who, with her soldier lover, 
leaves the circus (where she i$ a star) and takes up a life of 
love where both eventually realize that the only way out is 
death. The footage has been shot with amazing beauty. El
vira s dazxing, long blond hair, the rustling of wheat in the 
fields, the humming of bees all contribute to an impressive 
composite. The quarrel is not with what is on the screen, but 
with what is not. There has to be more of this attractive couple 
than we are given by Widerberg. They solely seem to rely 
upon love and lethargy. There is a missing element herea 
lack of committment. Their voices remain the samedull and 
monotonous. Pia Degermark is astonishingly beautiful as El
vira, and her lover, Sexton, is played by Thommv Gerggren. 
It is difficult to state if they act well or not. Widerberg doesn t 
really show us and the pair cant really say.
voLwso0 laDesS bilcuw is an inconsistent Czechoslovak
ian film by 29 year old Jiri Menzel. Although the film lacks 
focus, there are some good moments which hint at Menzel s 
potential as a film maker. The story centers around a young 
boy who is a trainee at a God-forsaken railroad station in an 
isolated Czech community. The film primarily, deals with his 
blossoming manhood, his eagerness and fear of intercourse and 
eventually, his lost innocence. Interestingly enough, the sub-$lots 
work better than the main story line. There is a rakish dis
patcher who seduces a pretty telegrapher by stamping her rear 
end and thighs with rubber customs stamps. Their German 
authorities (This is during WW II, by the way) are astonished 
and hold a hearing at the station. All the while the emplovees 
have been planning to blow-up a passing ammunition train as 
part of the Czech resistance. It just so happens that the young 
boy is the only one free from the hearing who can execute the 
plan and in this grand, proud gesture he is killed. The night 
before he has lost his virginity. having been seduced by the 
glamorous delivery girl of the explosives.
The outstanding performance in the film is by Josef Somr 
as the philandering dispatcher. His character is vivid both in 
his subtlety and the resulting poignancy. Vaclav Neckar is inquenchably honest as the trainee and, I suppose, good. But 
there is a paradox here. Menzel has made him, seemingly, ap
athetic. If this is true why would he slice his wrists (unsuc
cessfully) when he fails to perform the male act(a Perhaps there 
has been a bit of misdirection here. Menzel shows him as faun
like and, until the end, almost weak. Menzel himself mades a 
nice appearance as the doctor who tries to help Neckar with 
his sexual problem. Photography, tightly framed, is by Jaromir 
Sofr. The Wav in whcih oeople are moved in and out of frame, 
the lack of elaborate close-up and zooms in and out, is quite 
refreshing and well done. Music by Jiri Sust adds a humorous 
note to this film (billed as a comedy). Both his employment 
of military marches in the titles and Wagerian reprises later on 
are to the pictures great advantage.
One of the jarring things about Menzel s direction is his 
lack of daring. He deals with the film s elements easily and 
uninterestingly in many instances. He has substituted character 
study for contrivances. The trainee goes to the stationmaster s 
wife to ask her advice on sex. She, during the scene, strokes 
the neck of a goose held firmly between her legs as she chats 
with him. Nothing is revealed, nothing furthered. The reaction 
was: What a poor way to handle an obvious contrivance. 
I'here is a moment, right out of Laurel and Hardy, with an over
sized land owner being helped onto his horse and immediately 
falling out of the saddle.
Elvira Madigan is now at the Shadyside and Closwlv Watch
ed Trains is down at the Strand in Oakland.

Riflemen End Season 
With Two Victories
C0 FLu jiuLoS
The C-MU rifle team closed 
the league season with an 11-5 
record by adding two victories 
to their total this past week
end.
The Tartan risers were to 
meet Allegheny and Duquesne 
in a three-way match at Tech 
on Saturday. Duquesne phoned 
in early and gave the Tartan* 
a victory by forfeit. The Alle
gheny team, however, clashed 
with the Tech riflemen in a very 
close duel which resulted with 
Tech on top by a mere six 
points. The final scores were 
C-MU 1,275, Allegheny 1,269.
That 1,275 for the Tartans was 
Techs highest team score of 
the season. The high five were 
ODonnel, 258; Westlake, 258;
Mankovich, 257; Sandgren, 254; 
and Boynton, 248.
This was the last match for 
seniors Ted Mankovich, team 
captain, and Leighton Westlake.
The rifle team would like to

mendation for their fine team 
support and consistently high 
scores. Ted Mankovich did much 
to coordinate matches and for 
the last two years has been 
among the top ten scorers of 
the WPIRL League. Leighton 
Westlake has also demonstrated 
fine shooting ability in every 
one of his matches.
Tartans Go Down Fighting 
Lang Sets CMU Scoring Mark
By Alan Letzt
The Tartans completed their season in a spectacular fashion but came out of the final two contests 
without a victory. The visiting squad from Pitt over came a six point deficit at the half to top the Tartans 
85-74 Wednesday evening. In the finale at W&J on Saturday, CMU set season marks with a 52 point half 
and 85 point total only to lose on a bucket with 8 seconds left, 87-85.
With the 89-46 rout at Pitt 
still fresh in both teams 
minds the Tartans set out to 
ruin Pitt Coach Bob Timmons 
final game and jumped to a 
36-30 lead in the first half.
The Panthers press, which 
had rattled the Tartans at the 
Field House was ineffective 
as C M U broke through the 
Pitt zone to score while stay
ing even with their opponents 
in the rebounding column. But 
both Bob Grazzini, who tallied 
ten points in the first half, 
and John Meister each picked 
up their third personal foul 
near the end of the half. This 
proved to be a crucial factor 
as the game progressed.
Pitt opened the second half 
by playing a more tenacious 
defense, and they began to 
take the ball down court 
much faster. When Pete Smith 
tossed in a long set shot, the 
score was tied 39-39. Neil Hou
ser, a senior Co-Captain, who 
was plauing his last home 
game for the Tartans, sank a 
20 foot jumper to put CMU 
back in the lead. However,
Bob Grazzini collected his 4th 
foul after only three minutes 
had elapsed in the half, and 
Bill W7eborg entered the game.
DeLisio scored twice to give 
Pitt a two point advantage, 
but Weborg and Stobbe both 
connected for C M U as the 
lead continued to change hands 
After Abrahams hook shot cut 
the Panthers lead to one points 
50 - 49, Pitt chalked up six 
straight points. At this point,
Neil Houser fouled out of the 
game and was replaced by 
Snow Mitchell. Mark Langs

drive and fifteen foot jumper 
helped narrow a nine point 
Pitt lead to four points. How
ever, three consecutive turn
overs by the Tartans enabled 
the Panthers to take a com
manding ten point lead and 
give their coach a farewell 
victory.
Tony Delisio paced Pitt 
with 25 points. Bill Abraham 
led CMU with 20 points and 
Mark Lang collected 19 points 
and 15 rebounds.
Saturday night, the Tartans 
invaded W and J to meet the 
team which they defeated in 
the season opener 57-52.
After the first ten minutes 
of plav, Wr and J pulled ahead by three points, 19-16. 
Bill Abraham scored twice for 
the Tartans to give CMU a 
33-32 lead, but then W and 
J reeled off 8 straight points 
to gain a 40-33 lead as the 
half ended. Abrams poured in 
fourteen points in the open
ing twentv minutes for CMU. 
Don Smith scored 15 in the 
half for W and J.
Grazzini and Meister both 
hit two pointers to reduce the 
deficit to three points as the 
second half got underway. 
Neil Houser proceeded to steal 
the ball from W and J s Jack 
Houser and drove in for the 
score. Neil scored again brt 
Jack sank two jumpers to increasd his team s lead to five 
points. 48-43.
Meister s bucket created a 
50-50 deadlock as the Tartans 
charged back. But the Presi
dent s dynamic duo, Smith and 
Evans, refused to let up, hence 
W and J went ahead 70 - 62 
with ten minutes remaining in 
the game. Within a two min
ute interval, Lang and Smith 
both committed their fourth 
fouls.
With 5 minutes to go, Lang 
drove towards the hoop twice 
and drew fouls from the Pres
idents forwards Kirbv and 
Hinkle which sent them both 
to the bench with five person
als. W and J still held on to 
a ten point leap 85-75 with 
;38 showing on the score
board clock. Lang was then 
fouled by Don Smith who also 
had to leave with five fouls. 
He was the President s leap
ing scorer for the game with 
24 points.
With 57 seconds remaining, 
and three members of the W 
and J starting 5 on the bench, 
Lang scored on a technical 
foul shot and the Tartans were 
now only four points behind 
with time running out. Meis
ter added two more points to 
make the score 85-83 and only 
36 seconds to go.
Orwig was whistled for an 
offensive foul and Bob Graz
zini, in a pressure one and 
one foul situation, cut the 
cords with both free throws to 
knot the score at85-all!
The Tartans courageous 
comeback appeared to earn 
them a chance at victory in 
onertime period. But W and 
J had possession of the ball 
and 16 seconds to take advan
tage of it. Bob Landsay, a 
freshman reserve who was for
ced into action when the three 
starters fouled out, nullified 
the CMU effort with a 25 foot 
jump shot which passed 
through the hoop w ith five sec
onds left in the game.
The Tartans quickly called
for a time out, but none were 
remaining and W and J regain
ed possession of the ball to 
hold on for their 87-85 win.
Bill Abraham paced the Tar
tan scoring attack for the third 
consecutive game as he scor
ed 24 points. Meister chipped 
in with 17. Terry Evans con
tributed 22 points for W and 
J in addition to Smith s 24

Track Fanatics 
Start Practice
Spring is the favorite time of 
the year for most red-blooded 
students. Spring Carnival, girls, 
boys, sunshine, warmth, and 
fun. To some people spring also 
produces an almost unstopable 
urge. To these people spring 
means track. About two weeks 
ago, just when the first ray otf 
sun appeared this year, the track 
people were all ready to go. Al
most every day some of these 
nuts (you have all heard of 
track nuts) are running, jump
ing, or lifting weights to get 
ready for the coming season. 
These students are not really 
crazy (hear that Psychology De
partment) ; they just have track 
in their blood.
The average track nut ap
pears completely normal most 
of the time. He is as lazy or 
lazier than most students, he 
has just as many good and bad 
habits as normal, as he has 
just as much trouble studying 
as anyone else, and in fact, if 
you never saw the effect that 
the smell of spring, the sight of 
a track, seeing an early indoor 
meet, or the warmth of fresh 
spring sunshine had on him, 
you would think that he was a 
completely sound, rational, nor
mal, human being. Once the 
feel of track gets into a person 
it is hard to escape. Each spring 
when the disease strikes there 
is nothing that the person can 
do about it. He must spend time 
on and vEround the track.

When the Tartans concluded the 67-68 basketball season 
against VV and J on March 2, a sigh of relief must have emitted 
from the trame of Moe Fassinger and everyone else involved 
with basketball at CMU. This has been a dismal campaign for 
Tech with several close overtime defeats and several not so 
close disasters. Playing a stronger and longer schedule the squad 
has succombed 14 times while coming out on top only 7. 
Actually with a few' breaks the Tartans record could have been 
much better. A good team, though, makes its ow n breaks.

Rebounding has been the most improved area of play. 
Bob Grazzini, recently inserted into the starting lineup, has 
been aggressive at both ends of the court. With Lang out front 
on offense, the Tartans can insert another big man into the 
line;up. If Bill Weborg can duplicate Grazzini s energies, the 
team will have three players 65 or over and Barry Hummel, 
who at 6 2 muscles his wav under the boards, next season. In 
recent games, sophomore Bill Abraham has taken Hummel s 
place amont the starting Five. With Hummel out of the action 
due to a broken foot, Abraham has done an excellent job under 
the boards, both w ith scoring and rebounding.
The Tartans will lose only Neil Houser due to graduation, 
raising hopes for next year. Houser is the teams best ballhandler, though, and Coach Fassinger will need someone to drib
ble the ball and start the offense. In recent games, however, 
Snow Mitchel has done well in this category. Perhaps with 
experience and some confidence the Tartans will alleviate their 
ball handling difficulties and consistently break the press, but 
unless they do, late minute defeats such as the team experi
enced this year will not be uncommon. With Meister and Lang 
on the outside, the poor outside shooting which confronted 
the team at the beginning of the current campaign won t be a 
problem. With the return of Humipel to the line up, and the 
further development of Grazzini and Weborg the Tartans will 
possess adequate rebounding strength.

Neil Houser, the only sen
ior on the CMU squad, scor
ed eight points in his final 
game in a Tartan uniform. An 
excellent defensive player, 
the Hawk had his best of
fensive display in the Tartan 
victory over Rochester w hen he 
led the team with 18 points.
Mark Lang s three field 
goals gave the Tartans top 
scorer 159 points for the sea
son. This beats the CMU re
cord of 158 established by 
Mike Flynn seven years ago.
Next season hopes to be a 
more prosperous one for the 
Tartans if they can get anof Lang, Grazzini, Abraham, 
Weborg and Hummel. John 
Meister has done a commen
dable job at one of the out
side positions and his backcourt mate may be either Mit
chell or De Huff. The experi
ence gained this year will be 
invaluable next season in aiping the team to work better 
against a full court press and 
to cut down on the total num
ber of turnovers. If the team 
gels, a better than .500 record 
mav be in sight.

Cultural Movement: 
Black Arts Festival
Pittsburgh, scene of such art 
showings as the Three Rivers 
Arts Festival and the Pittsburgh 
International, will host the Black 
Arts Festival in March.
A growing dissatisfaction over 
the failure of the civil rights 
movement to make any really 
significant changes for the ma
jority of Negroes during the 
past 13 years has led to the 
rise of a new element in the 
movement. This new element is 
putting a positive emphasis up
on black consciousness, the 
need to develop group solidar
ity, and a sense of self worth 
for black people in America.
Black Art is more than just 
the art that happens to be pro
duced by black people. Black 
artist understand their black
ness and their African heritage 
as integral to their expression. 
Their art is based on their ex
perience and their feelings as 
black men.
The Black Arts Festival will 
bring together the work of lead
ing black artists from Chicago 
and New York with artists from 
Pittsburgh in exhibitions of the 
major trends in Black Arts to
day.
The Festival will be held in 
three centers on three consecu
tive nights. The showing will 
debut at the Duquesne Univer
sity Union on Vickroy St., March 
13, at 7:30 pm. It will then be 
moved to the University of Pitts
burgh Student Union on March 
14 at 7:30 pm and to the Half
way Art Gallery in the Hill on 
March 15.
Represented in the Festival 
will be the House of Umoja 
Drummers and Dancers, a New 
York Afro-American group; 
jazz musician Calvin Strickland 
and his sextet from New York; 
Chicago photographer Roy Lew
is; the Afro-American Models 
and Dancers of Pittsburgh; 
Pittsburgh poet Charles Wil
liams; and Monduel and the 
Afro-Cuban Expressionists.
Under the sponsorship of sev
eral Pittsburgh groups and or
ganizations, the Festival will be 
an educational experience. It. 
will help to expose a significant 
cultural movement in the Black 
community which is now large 
ly unknown to white America.
All former residents of the Men's 
Dormitories are requested to c!aim 
any personal items still in storage. 
After April 1, 1968 all property not 
belonging to current residents will 
be discarded. Dorm counselors may
