SC Finances Patterns; 
Conducts Calendar Poll
by Liz Seley and Candy Etkin
Student Congress at the March 17 meeting passed a 
motion that will provide Patterns magazine $500.
The sum was requested by the 
literary publications to cover this 
years costs. $375 of the $500 are 
a direct grant and aid, the remain
ing $125 are a loan which will be 
paid back to the Student Congress 
by October 1.
The Calendar Committee has 
asked Congress members to par
ticipate in a poll involving pos
sible changes in the calendar. The 
questionnaire includes

Pablo Casals 
Letters Degree
by Carol S. Guber
Pablo Casals, world-renowned 
descrip- I cerllist, will receive an honary de
gree of Doctor of Humane Letters 
from Carnegie Tech on April 18 
at the Pittsburgh performance of
dents to give their opinions as to . his oratorio El Pessebro.
which system they would prefer. 
It also provides space for addi
tional comments.
Dick Elder, chairman of the 
Rules Committee, told congress 
members about plans to publish a 
revised student handbook. It 
would provide students with in
formation in approximately ten 
different areas. Among items in
cluded will be: campus lore; the 
physical plans of Carnegie Tech, 
Oakland and Pittsburgh; a guide 
to shows, transportation, televis
ion, the academic calendar, ad
ministration rules, housing rules. 
It will list extracurricular activi
ties. athletics, honoraries, and gen
eral information.
Bruce Handley, sophomore, 
electrical engineering, has been 
appointed head of the parking 
subcommittee. Handley is a com 
mutor. It is hoped that greater 
flexibility will be applied to the 
present parking regulations. The 
possibilities of parking stickers for 
frequent use of the facilities, and 
parking meters for infrequent use 
of parking space are being con 
sidered.
In the coming Student Congress 
elections a plurality system of vot 
ing will be applied. The plurality 
system means that the person with 
the most votes is elected. This will 
avoid the repeated votings which 
occur in the majority voting sys
tem.

130 Students March 
In Alabama Protest
by Mary Forester
British Poet 
To Lecture 
At Assembly
130 students from the University of Pittsburgh, Chatham 
College, Duquesne University, and Carnegie Tech, partici
pated in civil rights demonstrations in Montgomery, Alabama 
last week. ?
The students, accompanied by 
religious leaders, including Rabbi 
Richard Rubenstein, left from Pitt 
in three buses, on Sunday, March 
14. In Montgomery, they were 
housed by religious groups. Most 
students slept on coats, blankets, 
and sleeping bags in the Jackson 
Street Baptist Church.
On Monday night, about 40 stu
dents took part in a demonstra
tion in Montgomery. Unable to 
roach the Capital building, they 
sat on the sidewalk for two hours. 
There were no incidents on Mon
day, although many white citizens 
jeered the students.
horsemen ueed whips, rope, and 
canes to disperse the crowd.
Many students explained that 
they felt it their duty to partici
pate. Said Miss Siegel, I went 
because I had to. I wanted to 
show how I felt about the atroci
ties committed in Selma, to pro
test, and also to see for myself if 
all reports were true.
Howard Shuch, Carnegie Tech 
Freshman, said, I feel I have a 
responsibility to my fellow man: 
to allow him to walk in dignity 
where I am allowed to do so; to 
help him to speak freely in the 
hope that he may be heard, to 
help him assert his independence 
and his status of human being 
equal to myself.
by Li* Seley
Stephen Spender, contemporary 
British poet, will speak at the 
March 30 assembly.
Spenders works have been 
published since 1928 at which 
time Nine Experiments, a vol
ume of verse was printed. His 
poetry emphasizes political and 
socir.l themes.
In 1934 he wrote a memorial 
poem, Vienna, about the attack 
on the workers of that city by the 
fascist regime of Dolfuss.
Spender linked himself with 
Auden, Lewis and MacNeice 
through his volume Poetry Since 
1939. These men are referred to 
as the poets of the thirties.
During World War II Spender 
was active on the home front and 
wrote accounts oi air raids.

he Baptist church.
According to Miss Siegel, the 
norsemen attempted to separate 
;he group. One part of the group 
was able to run, but the other 
was cornered. The students 
were pushed against walls and 
porches. Miss Siegel said that the
Erwin R. Steinberg, Dean of 
Margaret Morison College, com
mented, I was concerned about 
the possibility that students might 
be hurt, but was pleased to see 
that Carnegie Tech students are 
not only aware of todays prob
lems, but are committed enough 
to take personal risks in showing 
where they stand.

Pretty heady stuff.
But then designing spacecraft to reach the Moon and

Snack Bar Service?
The Skibo snack bar, as the Tartan stated in its editorial 
last week, has not and, indeed, cannot take the place of a 
student union. It has failed, furthermore, to accomplish its 
primary function as a snack bar.
The procedures governing the operation of the snack 
bar appear to have been designed for inefficiency and for in
adequate sanitation.
Students who order even a few simple items must wait 
an inordinately long time for their orders to be completed. 
This is a frustrating waste of students valuable time.
The reasons for this inefficiency are quite clear. Each 
item in each order is served separately. Preparation of a 
second item is begun only after the first is served. If a stu
dent orders a hamburger and a milkshake, the hamburger is 
cooked and served, and then the milkshake is mixed. The 
result is a long wait for a few items, which, in the interim, 
have grown cold.
A system was introduced recently in a snack bar, such 
that students would wait in an orderly line at the counter, 
rather than stand around en masse.. If this system were de
signed to increase efficiency, it has failed.
This new procedure serves only to determine in what 
order students will be served; it does nothing to change the 
efficiency of serving.
What should be instituted in the snack bar is a 
system allowing for the simultaneous preparation by 
each of the help of not only several items, but several 
orders.
The disregard for sanitation in the snack bar is as ap
palling as the inefficiency is frustrating.
Items which require cooking are hastily handled and aie 
often underdone; food stains appear on dishes and silverware 
due to improper washing. The bins in which the silverware 
is kept are dusty and dirty.
Furthermore, used dishes and trays are allowed to pile 
ip on tables, making it impossible to sit at them. When the 
dishes are removed, the table tops are either perfunctorily 
cleaned or not at all.
We, the students of Carnegie Tech are entitled to effi
cient, high quality food service.
The administration is conducting an investigation of 
the food service system. It can not fail to reveal the deficien
cies in the operation of the snack bar. _____________

WhaCs Doing On Campus?

The events of the past few 
weeks in Alabama may seem for
eign and isolated to most of us, 
but to about a hundred students 
from Pitt, Chatham, and Mount 
Mercy who traveled to Alabama, 
they are extremely vivid. Having 
had the opportunity to talk to sev
eral of the students who made the 
trip, I hope to be able to recreate 
the situation and analyze its sig
nificance.
A Mount Mercy coed, Miss 
Kathie Pollock, described the trip 
down as both exciting and tense, 
with the busload of students be
ing similar to a collection of stu
dents in the physical sense only 
little gaiety present, evryone 
sensing the serious nature of the 
trip and the risk we were taking 
in traveling to Montgomery.
These students were dedicated 
,s shown by their participation in 
dmonstrations in Montgomery, 
those of us who have never 
taken part in a demonstration may 
not fully comprehend the signifi
cance of what they have done. 
They literally risked their lives in 
support of a conviction, namely, 
that the Negro should have the 
ame voting opportunity as the 
White Southerners.
To support ones beliefs in such 
a way is indeed courageous; howver, do the actions of the demontraters, the leaders of the dem
onstrations, and the civil rights 
Gr ganizations reflect the admirable 
intentions which they possess?
Does the blocking of public ' 
highways, public buildings, and 
other facilities support their con
viction or does it infringe on the 
rights of other citizens? Cer
tainly the way to eliminate one 
inequality is not to add others to | 
it. Can demonstrations in a hos
tile environment such as Selma or 
Montgomery really hope to remain 
peaceful, as the leaders of the 
demonstrations claim? It often 
seems that the demonstrations ac
tually incite violence, such as the 
one led by Martin Luther King 
through the streets of Selma at 
twelve midnight, a most unusual 
time to stage a demonstration.
James Foreman, head of SNNC, i 
was described by Miss Pollock as 
inciting demonstrators to break 
through the police lines, and ac
tually trying to incite violence. 
Rabbi Richard Rubenstein has also 
recently attacked the leaders of 
SNNC for bringing the Pittsburgh 
students to Montgomery under 
false pretenseshaving promised 
them permits to march but hav
ing been unable to produce them 
once the students arrived.
As a result, all of the college 
students from Pitsburgh could 
have been jailed in Montgomery,
. and they would not have been re
leased until bail was posted for 
them. These actions of King and 
especially Foreman, point to the 
leadership crisis that the various 
civil rights groups are experienc- |

Editor Asserts Value 
Of Literary Arts Magazine
Editor, the Tartan:
As editor of Patterns, I reg
ularly hear students questioning 
the rightful place of a literaryarts magazine on an essentially 
technically-oriented campus. It 
seems to me that Patterns should 
be viewed not as undermining this 
bend, but rather as tangible evi
dence that a technical school can, 
so to speak, transcend itself, and 
welcome creative expression in 
art as well as in science and tech
nology.
This is not meant to be an ex
cuse for our publication. We do 
not need one. The College of Fine 
Arts and Margaret Morrison Car
negie College, to whose creativ 
and skillful students Patterns owe# 
its consistently high degree of professionality, are integral parts of 
this University in Colleges cloth
ing.
Patterns 1965 goes on sale early 
in May. Only with the united sup
port of every department  stu
dents and faculty alike  can 
Patterns continue to bring more, 
and more diversified, aspects of 
individual creativity to the college 
community at large. Please give us 
this support.

Finance Committee Chairman 
Apologizes To The Thistle'
Editor, the Tartan:
On behalf of the Finance 
Committee, of which I am chair
man, I offer a public apology to 
the editor and business manager 
of the Thistle.
At the last meeting of Student 
Government, held on March 17, 
the committee released figures 
relative to Thistles financial con
dition which do not reflect the 
reality of the situation. It seems, 
in fact, that the staff of the 
Thistle deserve considerable cred
it for improving the yearbooks 
financial standing relative to this 
time last year.
I would like to point out, how
ever, that the information re
leased by the Committee was 
validated by the Co-ordinator of 
Student Activities the afternoon 
of the congress meeting and was 
the most recent information avail
able from the Accounting Office. 
The discrepancy is due to the 
delay that accompanies the pro
cessing of information by the Ac
counting Office, and is compound
ed by the complete lack of data 
relative to Accounts Receivable. 
In Thistles case the Accounts Re
ceivable total is so large that the 
conclusions drawn by the com
mittee must be reversed.
Furthermore, the editor of the 
Thistle and the Co-ordinator of 
(continued on page 5)
ing and the immediate need for a 
change.
The feelings of the students are 
most admirable, but their efforts 
are in need of re-direction. One 
n ust not be naive enough to be
lieve that Negroes, as a whole, 
will be significantly better off if 
they are able to vote. Their econ
omic and social status will remain 
effectively the same. The ad
vancement of the Negros position 
in the South requires the par
allel development of both the Ne
gro and White. They must first 
understand each others position 
and then strive to change their 
values and attitudes in the direc
tion of attaining a balanced so
ciety. Thus far, there has been 
very little effort to make the 
Southern White understand  
mainly because most regard it as 
an impossible task which will take 
many decades. However, it is a 
necessary task, and the individ
ual who focuses his efforts toward 
the furtherance of understanding 
between the Negro and the white 
will be making a most important 
contribution to the civil rights 
movement.

Student Activities were still dis
cussing the situation only mo
ments before the meeting was 
called to order. At that time the 
co-ordinators feelings towards 
Thistle had changed considerably 
but it was too late for all the 
concerned parties to reach mutual 
agreement.
In the future the committee will 
rely less on the official returns 
supplied to the Co-ordinator of 
Student Activities, and seek the 
more encompassing, though not 
always as accurate* information 
supplied by the individual busi
ness managers. By accuracy we do 
not infer dishonesty but wish to 
point out the lack of cancelled 
checks, or other machine printed 
records, that could furnish accu
rate up-to-minute information.
On behalf of the Finance Com
mittee I hope that this misunder
standing has been corrected by 
this letter, and urge the student 
body to support Thistle by pur
chasing the 1965 yearbook.

Changes On Campus
Hunt Library Brings 
Tech Books Together
by Sue Attinson
No longer will western civ students wind their way up 
the curved stairway of AH to wait in line for a reserve book 
only to find it gone. No longer will students be faced with 
the problem of finding the E&S or Fine Arts Libraries. The 
long awaited Hunt Library is now completed and in use. 
So stated the Tartan editorial of September 20, 1961.
The completion of The Hunt 
Library that month had made it 
possible, for the first time in Car
negie Techs history, for all of the 
schools books and periodicals to 
be collected under one roof.
As recently as June 1961, the 
schools library collection was 
divided between the Main Library 
on the third floor of Baker Hall 
and six branch libraries and the 
SIA Reading Room in the Grad
uate School of Industrial Admini
stration building. The six branch 
libraries: engineering, science, 
mathematics, Margaret Morrison 
and fine arts, were located in 
various buildings on campus.
Library hours varied from 69 Vz 
hours a week in the main arts and 
sciences libraries to 61^ hours a 
week in the engineering branch 
and 56 2 hours in the SIA Read
ing Room. The total collection of 
books and periodicals numbered 
approximately 160,500.
Though as early as the mid 
1940's plans had been drawn up 
for a campus library building, 
construction could not be started 
because of a lack of sufficient 
funds. Ground was broken for the 
building in the fall of 1959 after 
a gift of $2.800,000 by Mr. and 
Mrs. Roy A. Hunt made possible 
the financing of the construction.
According to original specifica
tions, the library was designed to 
accommodate 350,000 books in the 
library proper and another 125,000 
in basement alcoves. Plans were 
changed, however, and the base
ment is now used for bound per
iodicals. The library book capa
city is now estimated at 500,000.
A fifth floor penthouse in the 
building was furnished to house 
Mrs. Hunts collection of rare bo
tanical books, prints and paint
ings. In discussing the function of 
her collection, which is reported 
to be the largest outside the 
British Museum, Mrs. Hunt said, 
It is my expectation that this li
brary will become increasingly 
useful to the scholar, to the artist 
and to the flower lovers in gen
eral.
When The Hunt Library was 
dedicated in October, 1961, Dr. 
J. C. Warner, former president of 
Carnegie Tech, described the ade
quate university library and con
cluded by saying, Surely The 
Hunt Library is such a place.
Yet, when The Hunt Library was 
opened for student use there were 
complaints.
At the building's dedication, 
students demonstrated against its 
architectural design. They at
tempted to bum a figure in effigy 
on the roof of the Fine Arts 
Building. Students also complain
ed about the complexity of the 
reserve room. According to a 
Tartan article of October 11, 1961, 
the loudest and strongest com
plaint is over the seemingly com
plex reserve book room.
Since 1961, the reserve room 
books have been re-arranged in 
Dewey Decimal order.
Today, The Hunt Library holds j 
more than 227,000 books and per- j 
iodicals Its weekly hours have
been extended to 90%. And ac
cording to Mrs. Scarlot, of the li
brary administration, Visitors 
from all over the country are un
failingly impressed with the facili
ties and the availability of ma
terials in The Hunt Library.

What does it take to spark a man to his very 
best ... to bring out the fullest expression of his 
ability and training? At Ford Motor Company 
we are convinced that an invigorating business 
and professional climate is one essential. A prime 
ingredient of this climate is the stimulation that 
comes from working with the top people in a 
field . . . such as Dr. James Mercereau.
Jim Mercereau joined our Scientific Laboratory 
in 1962. Recently, he headed a team of physicists 
who verified aspects of the Quantum Theory by 
creating a giant, observable quantum effect in 
superconductors. This outstanding achievement 
was the major reason the U. S. Junior Chamber of Commerce selected 
Dr. Mercereau as one of Americas Ten Outstanding Young Men of 1964. 
Your area of interest may be far different from Dr. Mercereaus; However, 
you will come in contact with outstanding men in all fields at Ford 
Motor Company.
We believe the coupling of top experience and talent with youth and 
enthusiasm is stimulating to all concerned. College graduates who join 
Ford Motor Company find themselves very much a part of this kind of 
team. If you are interested in a career that provides the stimulation of 
working with the best, see our representative when he visits your campus. 
We think youll be impressed by the things he can tell you about working 
at Ford Motor Company.

Officials Consider Possibility 
OF MMCC As Coed School
by Carol S. Guber
Students have questioned the possibility of Margaret 
Morrison College being expanded into a liberal arts co
educational instiution. -----------------------------------------
Although a formal study of this 
question has not been made by 
the administration, school offi
cials have felt that such a change 
should be considered.
Dr. Edward R. Schatz, Vice 
President of Academic Affairs, 
said, As Vice-President of Aca
demic Affairs I would welcome a 
study by the faculty, administra(0m, and trustees on the possibil
ity of a coed liberal arts program 
at Carnegie Tech.
Erwin R. Steinberg, Dean of 
Margaret Morrison College, stated 
that alumni must be considered in 
such a change. He also cited the 
problem of costs. According to Dr. 
Steinberg, because tuition covers 
only half the cost of education at 
Carnegie Tech, where would the 
money come from for the male 
f tudents of Margaret Morrison 
College? Would this mean that 
only half the number of women 
would be accepted to make room 
for the men?
Dean Steinberg along with 
other members of the administra
tion questioned the need for an
other coeducational liberal arts 
school in the Pittsburgh area. 
They felt that permitting mass 
enrollment in the Margaret Mori:fcson program would not be an 
improvement in the college itself.
They questioned what type of 
program could be offered using 
Carnegie Techs resources in the 
formation of a coed liberal arts 
school.
Dr. Robert Kibbee, Assistant to 
the President for Planning, stated 
that a program in history and 
English could be related with pro| Trams in art or drama.
Dr. John R. Coleman, Dean of 
Humanities and Social Studies, 
felt that a liberal arts program 
such as this could bridge the gap 
between the three colleges at Car
negie Tech.
Other administrators felt that 
such a program would attract new 
faculty to Carnegie Tech. Because 
the faculty would be expanded, 
class enrollment could be eniftarged and efficiency increased.
According to Dr. Kibbee, this 
would bring people to Carnegie 
Tech with varied points of view 
besides the scientific analytical 
view.
One use of liberal arts school is 
disputed by the administration: 
whether it is an advantage or dis
advantage to have a department 
available for male dropouts from 
 other departments at Carnegie 
Tech to enter and still remain at 
Carnegie Tech.
A disadvantage cited by Dean 
Steinberg is that research in 
counseling and the role of women 
in society is not generally done 
at liberal arts schools. He is not, 
however, stating that Margaret 
Morrison should not become a 
coed school.
Another disadvantage was sug
gested by Dr. Schatz, Carnegie 
Tech has been a professional 
school, it needs the best liberal 
arts education possible. If for
mation of a liberal arts school re
duced interests of the faculty in

teaching professional students 
there would be a disadvantage.
In consideration of the forma
tion of a coed liberal arts school, 
the administration is considering 
a study in the future. The final 
decision, however, will be made 
by Carnegie Tech trustees.

Beta Theta Pi outlasted the Grad Physics 41 to 35 to cap
ture the school basketball championship during last Friday 
evenings Intramural Night program, while Alpha Tau 
Omega nipped last years cham- ?
solation encounter.
Title Game Nip and Tuck
The championship contest was a 
nip and tuck affair during the 
first quarter, in which the lead 
changed hands several times. The 
shooting of Tom Mauretta kept 
the Betas ahead of the Grad Phy
sics most of the time, as the Phy
sics continually fed Bill Oosterhuis 
for jump shots from the corner. 
During the second period, the 
Betas press finally began to pay 
off, and Jim Kamm found him
self open for easy layups. As a 
result, BTP took a 22 to 16 lead 
into the locker room with them 
at half-time. However, the Beta's 
couldnt seem to break the game 
wide open, and during the third 
quarter the Grad Physics kept the 
margin below five points most of 
the time.
The final period began with the 
Betas ahead 31 to 26, and the 
two teams played even ball for 
the rest of the game. With a little 
over two minutes remaining, the 
Grad Physics had a chance to re
duce the bargain to three joints, 
tut the Betas press resulted in an 
offensive foul and that was the 
ball game.

the most potent weapon. The first 
half of the ball game was domi
nated by GSIAs strength on the 
backboards and the long jump 
shots of ATOs Frank Oliver. The 
lead changed hands seven times 
before the grads began to pull 
away behind Bob Crotty to a 22 
to 17 half-time advantage. ATO 
turned to a man pressing defense 
in the third quarter, and with 
Fred Brown scoring on the re
sulting fast breaks and A1 Green 
opening up the GSIA defense with 
some effective outside shooting. 
ATO made up the five point de
ficit and moved into a 34 to 28 
lead. With the loss of Bill Schliep
on personals at the outset of the 
final quarter, the job of stopping 
the grads under the boards rested 
with Tom Kline and Jim Hagarman.
Behind by six points with lew 
than four minutes remaining, 
GSIA had to foul to retain pos
session of the ball. The strategy 
almost worked as the grads had 
the ball out of bounds with only 
four seconds left on the clock and 
trailing ATO by two points. Dick 
Murphy took the lead-in pass and 
drove for the tying points, but 
fine defensive moves by Kline and 
Hagarman forced him to take a 
desperation jump shot which 
bounced off the side of the rim 
as the buzzer sounded. Oliver led 
the Taus with 17 points while 
Green added 11 and Schliep 10. 
For GSIA, Crotty topped every
one with 21 points while Murphy 
added 9 and Art Nevins 6.

Riding a hot streak after 
winning four out of five 
meets, the Carnegie Tech 
rifle team left for the U. S. 
Merchant Marine Academy at 
Kings Point, New York, for 
their biggest match of the 
season, the NRA Intercolleg
iate Sectionals. When the 
match was over, the scores 
made it look as if only Mike 
Knepley had made the trip 
and had taken a few strag
glers along with him.
Mike turned in the finest per
formance of any Tech rifleman in 
recent years and was, with the ex
ception of Penn States Dunning, 
the outstanding competitor in the 
match. Knepleys 100-96-94290 
was second only to Dunnings 99- 
95-93287, which was all that 
kept Carnegie Techs teamscore 
respectable.
CITs number one team shot a 
dismal 1116 and finished sixth out 
of a field of nineteen teams. Ted 
Mankovish was second man for 
the first team with a 97-93-92 
282. Rich Damberg shot a 98-95- 
85278, and Woody Whitlatch had 
one of his poorest days of the 
year, a 96-91-82269.
Freshman Howard Graham pac
ed the second team to a 1099 with 
a 98-93-88284. He was followed 
by McCormick at 275, and West
lake and Minnemear with 270s. 
This 1099 was good enough for 
thirteenth place.
Tournaments of this type 
won by the teams who have 
days; in this category, Tech was 
lucky to finish sixth. City College
