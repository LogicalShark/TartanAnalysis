African Symposium
Am bassdo rDehfs
During the week of November 3 - 8, an African Symposium will 
be held on the campus of Carnegie-Mellon University. During this 
time, students and the general public will have the opportunity to 
attend a wide range of functions, which are intended to begin to fill 
the educational need which exists within many, with regard to the 
rich African culture and traditions. ... , ......... 
Firing Line 
To Examine 'University'
The Ys Firing Line series 
tomorrow will dig into the 
question Who is the University? 
at 3:30 p.m. in the Ballroom with 
a panel of students and faculty 
split on a liberal-conservative 
spectrum of views on the Uni
versitys interaction with society.
Behavior of all members of the 
University in the past few weeks 
of crises has been shaped by in
dividual responses to these ques
tions. Much attention has been 
given to the specific issues of 
patterns of discrimination in con
struction employment, but rela
tively little toward the underly
ing assumptions about the nature 
of the university.
Firing Line will be modera
ted by James Qualben, History, 
and the panel will consist of 
Leonard Rapping, GSIA; Robert 
Griffiths, Physics, Pat Cavan
augh, chairman, Student Senate; 
and Jenifer Digby, who will put 
one another on the firing line as 
well as be put there by mem
bers of the audience.
Some of the questions to be 
considered are:
Who should make decisions 
and speak for the University?
What should be a Universitys 
responsibility to society?
How does/should the Univer
sity Define its self-interest?
Is there a valid distinction 
between a moral and a political
stand.?
The event will continue until
5 p.m. so that those who are not 
free at 3:30 can attend.
C-MU and 
Samples of
C-MU has moon dust! A vial 
containing about one-seventh 
of an ounce of the brownishgray material, gathered by As
tronaut Neil A. Armstrong on 
his moon walk July 21, is in the 
possession of Carnegie-Mellon 
University and the University of 
Pittsburgh.
During the next few months, 
teams of scientists from both 
institutions will study widely dif
fering aspects of the dust.
Dr. Bruce Hapke of the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh will try to 
discover what give the moon soil 
its dark color. A comparable 
sample of earth material would 
be much lighter, Dr. Hapke 
said.
A group headed by Dr. Tru
man Kohman of C-MU will inves
tigate the chemical history of 
the moon samples. Their findings 
will have important influence on 
theories of the formation of the 
moon and the rest of the solar 
system.
Were interested in getting 
dates of events way back from 
the very beginning, Dr. Koh
man said. Dr. Kohmans research 
will include studies of the isotopic

This college is not new, ex
pressed the feelings of most of 
the faculty and students who at
tended a meeting all day Satur
day to discuss and evaluate the 
progress of the new College of 
Humanities and Social Science.
The most sweeping reform sug
gested to correct the present 
discontent with the new college 
was the proposal that 32 unspeci
fied courses from any college, 
and no physical education,

composition of trace elements in 
the moon material.
Dr. Kohman and Dr. Hapke 
traveled to Houston to obtain 
the materials from the NSA space
craft center where it has been 
stored. They brought back about
10 grams each.
They expect to get samples 
of rock chips next week, Dr. 
Hapke said.
The Pittsburgh scientific teams 
are among some 140 scientific 
groups throughout the world 
who are involved in the analysis 
of the moon samples.
All of the groups will report 
their findings at a scientific ses
sion in Houston in January.
The Pittsburgh samples will be 
returned to the National Aeron
autics and Space Administration 
after the scientists have comple
ted their research, probably in 
six months, Dr. Hapke said.
A moon sample will be exhibi
ted in the Mellon Institute lob
by off Bellefield Street Mon
day through Friday from 10 am. 
to 9 p.m. In addition, a sample 
will be on display throoughout the week at the Hillman Li
brary at the University of Pitts
burgh.
Reforms
be required for graduation, i.e., 
there would be no required cour
ses. A minority report suggested 
that one course from each of the 
following areas. History, English, 
Social Science, the Arts, and 
Math or Science, be required by 
a department to fulfill its parti
cular major program.
In addition, the task force 
group suggested that three to 
five days be set aside at the be
ginning of each semester to 
counsel and advise students about 
which courses are available.
The meeting, set up by dis
contented faculty and students 
in the New H & SS, split up in 
small discussion groups in the 
morning to air general gripes. 
The various groups reported 
back to a general session before 
a lunch break.
Among the comments reported 
to this session were: The phychology department asks you to 
declare your major; the college 
says you cant. Another group 
reported that, The catalogue 
grossly misrepresented the col
lege.
There is poor teaching here, 
said one student. And the clas
ses are much too large..
We have no sense of com
munity or identity, complained 
another group.
There is a limited variety 
of courses. There are not enough 
Fine Arts courses open to us. 
There is a lack of anthropology 
and sociology courses, one stu
dent commented.
Academic freedom is for the 
teachers, not the students, said 
a student.
The comments of each group 
were listed on a blackboard and 
from these, 11 major areas were 
designated as the topics for af
ternoon task force groups. The 
subjects to be discussed were: 
The Historical Understanding 
course, the Art course, free semThe Symposium, organized by 
the International Club and
SPIRIT, will include lectures on 
different aspects of African so
ciety by prominent Africans and 
African-study specialists. Stu
dents will be invited to attend 
exhibits of African art, and to 
enjoy presentations by artists, 
including percusionists Olatunji.
The four day lecture series, 
Nov. 4-7, will include addresses 
by Dr. David Nicol, Ambassador 
of Sierre Leone to the United 
Nations; and by E. bG Debrah, 
Ambassador of Ghana to the 
U. S. Dr. Nichols presentation 
will begin at 11:30 a.m. on Nov.

munication, counseling, facili
ties, curriculum structure, eval
uation, identity.
The bnC- MUTTFMUt-T snuiTC
was the first given after the af
ternoon sessions met. Dr. Schoenwald reported that the program 
was designed to encompass two 
kinds of events: (1) those rela
ted to specific , courses, leading 
from the curriculum to the out
er world, and (2) those dealing 
with topics students are per
haps unfamiliar with.
Inadequate publicity of the 
program was mentioned as one 
of the problems the committee 
would attempt to remedy. One 
student asked how professors feel 
about cuts to attend these events. 
Its a personal decision, he 
was told. Get a note from Schlesinger, was another alterna
tive.
That the dTC ciUTSn should be 
a full year was the opinion of 
most freshmen. Therefore, the 
committee proposed that the 
course be extended. The first 
semester should include three 
areas distributed evenly  kine
tics, visual and oral. The second 
semester, which would be optionAmbasdaorD ba ehfr Gn
11:30 a.m. in the Skibo Ballroom, 
the Activities Board will present 
Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. He will 
discuss violence as an American 
Way of Life with a reference to 
existential politics as put forth 
by Herbert Marcuse.
Mr. Marcuse holds the be
lief that it is necessary and right, 
as a matter of principle, to howl 
down views with which one dis
agrees and to supress those who 
utter such views ; . . . and that 
contemporary society has absorb4, and Ambassador Debrahs at 
the same time on Thurs. Nov. 6. 
After these lectures, panels of 
African students from the Pitts
burgh area will hold discussions 
with the speakers. In addition, re
served lunches will be served 
after the addresses of the two 
Ambassadors. This will give stu
dents an excellent opportunity 
to meet and converse with the 
guest speakers. All those interes
ted in attending either of these 
luncheons should contact the Y 
office.
The lecture of Wed. Nov. 5 
will be presented by Prof Halim 
El Dabh, a Musicologist from 
Kent State University. On Fri
day, students will have the op
portunity to hear Dr. Richard 
Stevens, professor of African Stu
dies from Lincoln University. 
Although the detailed schedule 
of events will appear in the 
Tartan, it is now definite that 
the well known African percus
sionist Olatunji will appear in 
concert at 8 p.m. on Sat. Nov. 8. 
to close the symposium.
The program of the Symposium 
has been designed to bring both 
black and white Americans to 
a greater awareness of the tra
ditions of African nations are 
becoming most significant, expecially as these countries be
gin to exert more and more in
fluence on international affairs.
Through programs on African 
socio-political patterns, through 
the films, art exhibits, and cul
tural performances presented 
throughout the week, the Afri
can Symposium may serve sev
eral complementary functions. It 
is hoped that it will demonstrate 
to the community that Pittsburgh 
academia is aware and concern
ed with society beyond the cam
pus. It is also hoped that the sym
posium will stimulate interest to 
the extent that a more ex
tensive black studies program 
will be supported at CMU. For 
the student, it provides a week of 
intense exposure to the tradi
tions of a little known and little 
understood continent.
In response to this, Mr. Sch
lesinger states that this creed 
contains so much in the way of 
fakery and falicy  to put it 
bluntly, it is so preposterous and 
so depraved  that I do not see 
how it could long be entertain
ed by any serious democrats.
A luncheon will be held im
mediately following the lecture 
in Room 100, Skibo. Reservations 
must be made before Wednesday

Dear Mr. Stever,
May i express an opinion re
garding the campus demonstra
tion by some of your students last 
week concerning the Black Coali
tions drive for more jobs for 
Negroes. I am delighted that at 
last there are some young people 
at your school who are willing to 
speak up on social issues, who are 
concerned enough about their fel
low man to take a stand on their 
behalf. Unfortunately, CarnegieMellon has long had a reputation 
of being a school of and for egg
head intellectuals who care only 
about book-learning and further
ing their own interests.
Now, although I understand 
there were more than 1,000 of 
your students who actually took 
part in the demonstration at the 
campus, only 450 of those young 
people were brave enough to give 
their names, and that you intend 
to have a hearing for them with 
possible disciplinary action. That, 
of course, is your perogative. 
However, I should think that you 
would want to give them roses in
stead of brickbats!
I hope to see more demonstra
tions by your students. How about 
getting them started on the war in 
Vietnam?

There has been much talk 
among students, teachers, depart

should be taken towards classes

Wednesday, Oct. 15. I, therefore, 
think it is important to make 
known the policy of the Moritorium Committee at C-MU.
Our policy is that on Oct. 15 we,

will not attend classes in protest 
to the continuing U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam. We are asking 
other students, teachers, and ad
ministrators to miss classes and 
to set aside their work and join us 
for the activities in Skibo and on 
the march to Mellon Square for a 
rally. We are not asking the ad
ministration to cancel classes for 
us because we thing it is impor
tant that each student, teacher, 
and administrator be free to make 
his or her own decision. We feel it 
is both important and education
al for each member of the cam
pus community to try to decide for 
himself what type of relationship 
there should be between ones in
dividual pursuits, ones views, 
and ones actions (both public and 
private).
If the killing in Vietnam is bus
iness as usual, then maybe busi
ness should not continue as usual.
John Agatston
Paternalism?
Editor, The Tartan:
When a friend sent us Mary 
Sullivans column about segregat
ed housing in the C-Map program,
we had rather mixed reactions. 
The existence of a program to 
bring Black students to CarnegieMellon came as a pleasant sur
prise. The action taken in assign
ing these students to special wings 
of the dorm, however, rekindled 
unpleasant memories of CarnegieMellons completely paternalistic 
approach to students. It seems 
that action by fiat is still the pri
mary technique used by the Car
negie administration, but it is 
quite jarring to see this anti
quated method still being used in 
the context of something as mod
ern as the C-Map program. At the 
conceptual stage, there may have 
been some justification in re
garding those to be admitted un
der the program as a group, but 
now it is time to start dealing 
with these students (and all stu
dents ) as human beings.

MDC-AWS Jointly 
Bring Off Success
The newly formed Associated 
Women Students - Men's Dorm 
Council Joint Social Committee 
sponsored its first event by bring
ing the New Hudson Exit, a wellknown rock group, to the Skibo 
Ballroom for an all campus mixer 
last Saturday night. The mixer ac
tually became a concert;few peo
ple danced, although the ballroom 
was packed.
The New Hudson Exit has tour
ed with the Grass Roots, Steppenwolf. and Blood, Sweat and Tears, 
and also has cut several records.
The same night, AWS-MDC also 
sponsored a coffee house featur
ing various local talent, in Welch 
Hall (the Coed Dorm Lounge). 
This too was well attended, mak
ing the evening quite a success for 
the new committee.
The joint social committee was 
formed when several MDC mem
bers made a proposal to both 
groups suggesting that allocation 
of facilities and preparation of a 
social calendar would be much 
easier if the two councils cooper
ated. More mixers, coffee house 
and other events are planned.

Wierd Johnny Winter 
Presents Great Blues
Am yPb dLDr
Even a hippie might look twice if he say Johnny Winter walk
ing down the street. Aside from being about 62 and only weigh130 pounds, he has stark white hair, and his pink eyes are crossed. 
Not to exclude the Teeth That Braces Were Made For. But theres 
one thing Winter does very well that we should all be thankful for: 
He plays the blues.
Johnny Winter grew Uu in TexTom Paine swings on Hal
loween this year. The Activi
ties Board will present the offbroadway play Tom Paine on 
October 31 at 8:30 p.m. in the 
Carnegie Music Hall.
This production of Paul Fos
ters play features a top draw
er Broadway cast headed by Jer
ry Cunliffe in the title role. 
Franc Geraci is the director of 
the touring company.
Tom Paine is an histori
cal happening. The rhythm is 
definitely rock with Brechtian 
undertones. Movement at the 
theatre sometimes resembles 
a hippie version of Marat/ 
Sade done as a ballet.
In contemporary language and 
attitudes, playwright Foster ex
plores the tragedy of Tom Paine 
once known as Americas God
father, and the author of Rights 
of Man and Age of Reason 
and finally cast out by his fel
low Americans as an atheist 
and traitor.
The Satire bites through as we 
meet the historical figures of 
the day, from old Ben Frank
lin who originally sponsored 
Paines trip to this country, to 
the king of France licking a large 
lollipop. George III is an achdu-lieber  shouting idiot and 
Marie Antionette, a greedy 12- 
foot doll applying too much make
up.
Tom Paine, who penned the 
immortal These are the times 
that try mens souls, is also 
portrayed as a sodden drunkard, 
a wencher and a man not always 
with the courage of his lofty 
convictions. He is also, however, 
no summer soldier, no sun
shine patriot shrinking from his 
beliefs. Foster has tried to re
late the time of Tom Paine with 
that of the present, embroiled 
as we are in an unpopular war. 
How would Tom Paine fare 
today in the political air of L.
B.J.? is his question. His con
clusion is probably no better. 
This great country of ours, he 
whispers, is getting smaller  
smaller  smaller and smaller.
The play Tom Paine has re
ceived critical acclaim with ma
jor productions in New York
San Francisco, and Chicago as 
well as London, Edinburgh, Am
sterdam, and Frankfurt; and re
ceived such fantastic receptions 
in both Stockholm and Copen

Theatre and the Danish National 
Theatre respectively, that the 
play has been placed in reper

The author of Tom Paine is 
32-year old Paul Foster. Prior 
to Tom Paine he had written 
four one-act plays: Balls,
Hurrah for the Bridge, The 
Recluse, and The Hessian 
Corporal. He has just completed 
a new play, Tribe!, written to 
determine how the use of color 
can be exploited as a more in
tegral part of television drama.
Tom Paine is played by Jerry 
Cunliffe, who has been associa
ted with the play since its first 
incarnation at Cafe LaMama in 
1967. Other cast members from 
the original production are Wil
liam Ford, Pat McGraw, Mitchell 
McGuire, and Stefan Peters.
as, not far from Beaumont, 
which is Janis Joplin Country. 
He grew up normally except 
from the taunts and jeers of 
normal kids. Later on in high 
school, when every one else 
was trying to be Don Drysdale 
or Joe Namath, Winter got into 
music. After graduating from 
High school, he formed his own 
group: Winter. They played
around their area at events like 
dances, and coming out parties. 
They played anything that the 
audience wanted to hear but 
Winter particularly loved to play 
the Blues. Then, late last year (or 
early this year) Johnny Winger 
got his break. His manager en
gineered a fifteen minute jam 
session for Johnny at New Yorks 
famous Filmore East. The next 
day, a prestigious New York 
paper acclaimed Johnny Winter 
as the finest guitarist to appear 
on state in this city, or some
thing, but it was in any event a 
pretty heavy quote.
Then record companies found 
out about him and went after 
him like he was the only half 
dollar in a penny shower. Care
fully sorting out bids as high as 
half a million, he signed with 
Columbia Records under the stip
ulation that he would have free
dom in producing his records.
So now, Johnny Winter has 
made it. His group is still cal
led Winter and is composed of 
his original bassist, Tommy 
Shannon and his original drum
mer, Uncle John Turner. Peo
ple like B. B. King turn out to 
see him in concert and say He 
has a real feel for the blues. 
Willy Dixon helps Johnny ar
range his material. Hippies scream 
epithets at him. Jimi Hendrix 
(himself a guitarist of note) am
bles up on stage to gas with 
him. But still people see him and 
crack: Awww, its just some 
freak who uses hair coloring.

Why Close The Library?
Why, oh why, is the library 
closed after 5:00 p.m. on Fri
day and Saturday? Doesnt Mr. 
Fagerhaugh, head librarian, or 
the Administration realize that 
Friday and Saturday nights are 
the only free times some students 
have to use the library?
Surely, the rationale is not 
that most people go out on the 
weekends and that only a small 
percentage of students want to 
use the library at this time. Fri
day and Saturday nights are tra
ditionally date nights, but that 
doesnt necessarily mean that a 
person will be going out both 
nights. Some people like to 
work late one night so they 
have time to go out the other.
Besides, not everyone goes out 
on the weekends . . . and if the 
Administration has ever tried 
studying at Morewood while 
four fraternity houses across the 
street are having mixers, they 
might be more sympathetic with 
the student who tries to study in 
his room because the library is 
closed.
It seems a shame that the build
ing is locked up and unused two 
night a week (specifically, when 
students have the most time 
and inclination to use it.) If 
the reason for closing early these 
nights is thaa there isnt enough 
money in the librarys budget to 
pay the personnel needed to 
handle the two extra nights (as

Night if the hours were extended.
they say). Why isnt the librarys 
operating budget increased? 
If this University can afford to 
hand out money to every out
stretched palm on campus and canafford to lose as much as it did 
when the construction halt was 
called, they should be able to 
come up with enough to pay for 
the few additional employees 
needed to keep the library open 
Friday and Saturday night.
It would not be that hard to 
find students to work (another explanatioh given for early closing). 
Financial Aid has already given 
out all the jobs they had for work 
study students and even Food 
Service doesnt need any more 
student help.
If you would like to have ac
cess to the library on Friday and 
Saturday nights, do something 
about it. Prove there are enough 
people to open the library Fri
day and Saturday nights by filling 
out a ballot and mailing it to the

Food Service Answers 
Complaints of Students
FSC (Food Service Commit
tee) has been getting response 
from students about Food Ser
vice policies and would like to 
reply to the questions we have re
ceived. Keep the complaints 
and suggestions coming in (Use the 
FSC form).
The following questions, com
plaints and ideas were discussed, 
at the second meeting of FSC held 
on October 1, 1969 with Mr. Prillaman, Mr. Cappallino, Laurel 
Polanick, Peter Simon, Barbara 
Eckstein, Peter Rapp, and Joyce 
Smith.
REPLYS
FSC: We had suggested earlier 
(on the basis of numerous com
plaints) that the toast at break
fast be unbuttered to avoid 
sogginess. Now we are getting 
complaints that the toast is 
cold and that its unbuttered!
Mr. Prillaman: We will try in the 
future to keep the toast hot by 
using the special warming 
lights we have. If this is not 
satisfactory, we can go back to 
the previous system of pre
buttered toast.
FSC: Some students dont like the 
idea of pre-fired eggs at break
fast.
Mr. Prillaman: We instituted
this to avoid tie-ups in the 
morning. Those students who 
want eggs to order can still 
have them  just ask!
FSC: People buying in the a la 
carte line have noticed a rise 
in the price of bacon over last 
year, or have thought the price 
overly expensive. Has there 
been an increase and why?
Mr. Prillaman: The price of ba
con stayed the same even 
though the cost to us has gone 
up. We are selling our bacon 
at the lowest possible price  
and the student is really get
ting a fine quality product.
FSC: Someone suggested that 
Food Service buy Lemon and 
Strawberry Captair^ Crunch. 
Is this possible?
Mr. Cappallino: We have tried to 
get this product and it is sim
ply not available in this area. 
By the way  we will be in
troducing nuts, syrups, and hot 
fudge for sundaes twice a 
week.
FSC: We have gotten numerous 
complaints about boys still 
having to show their contract 
cards at Skibo. This tends to 
slow the line. Someone sugges
ted IDs with pictures on them 
for faster identification. What 
is your opinion of this?
Mr. Prillaman: As I understand  
it, this suggestion has been 
brought up in the past. I would 
be in favor of this because it 
would speed up the contract 
line, and make the transfer 
of contract numbers impossible. 
Maybe next year all university 
IDs would have the students 
picture on it  this should be 
brought before Student Govern- . 
ment. (Note: A proposal is now 
being formulated to be present
ed before Student Senate.)
FSC: Some students think the 
fixed price system (as in 
Morewood) should be re-in
stituted again in Skibo.
Mr. Prillaman: It would be al
most impossible to institute a 
fixed price system at Skibo un
less we have the student pay A 
before he enters, and this met 
with much criticism last year.
FSC: Some students have suggest
ed a lunch contract for com
muters. It this possible?
Mr. Prillaman: For the amount 
we would have to charge the 
student it still pays to eat in 
Morewood where he can get 
all he wants for a dollar.
FSC: Girls have been complain
ing about the new chairs in 
Morewood  theyre uncom
fortable: too low and dont
fit all the tables.
Mr. Cappallino: AWS chose and 
bought the chairs with the un
derstanding that the tables 
would have to be lowered. We 
could do this during the Christ
mas vacation.
Note* Food Service asks that stu
dents refrain from feeding their 
non-contract friends, and that 
they respect cafeteria property 
(i.e. silverware, dishes, tables 
and trays). Deficits resulting 
from these abuses will eventual
ly be absorbed by the students!

Campaign
Tricky Dick Attacked 
For Not Trying Hard
Washington  (CPS) In One of 
his rare displays of emotion, 
President Nixon showed a com
bination of determination and 
fear in his response to a repor
ters question at his latest news 
conference about the plans for 
massive anti-war protests this 
fall.
I have often said that theres 
really very little we can do with 
regard to running the univer
sity and college campuses of this 
country. We have enough prob
lems running the nation, the na
tional problems. Now I under
stand that there has been and 
continues to be opposition to the 
war in Vietnam on the campuses 
and also in the nation. As far as 
this kind of activity is concern
ed, we expect it.
However, the President said, 
under no circumstances will I 
be affected whatsoever by it.
Nixons determined sentiments 
are similar to the position Lyn
don Johnso took during the anti
war action of 1966 and 1967. 
Came 1968 and Johnson was af
fected. Richard Nixon realizes 
this and is trying hard to mini
mize the effects of the antiwary movement as it re-builds 
itself this fall.
The build-up appears to be 
mostly in numbers, rather than in 
new tactics. The Vietnam Mora
torium Committee is relying on 
the same tactics  class boy
cotts, teach-ins, rallies  which 
dominated the anti-war move
ment of the Johnson years. The 
New Mobilization Committee 
(to End the War in Vietnam) 
likewise is still relying on massive 
rallies and marches to convince 
the government to bring the 
troops home now.
The difference this year is the 
support the anti-war movement is 
getting from the populace. With 
the number increasing rappidly, 
500 student body presidents and 
editors have signed the call for 
the moratorium on classes Oct
ober 15. Organizers now expect 
one million students to parti
cipate.
Organizational meetings at sev
eral campuses such as Syracuse 
University have drawn more 
than 1,000 students. A half-day 
petition campaign in support of 
the moratorium at George Wash
ington University brough more than 
1,000 signatures.
Even administrations are get
ting into the act. Rutgers Univer
sitys administration has announ
ced the university will officially 
observe the moratorium. At 
other universities administra
tions have reminded faculty 
members may call off classes for 
the 15th and cautioned them 
against scheduling exams that 
day.
Nixon
PETER'S PIPERS
PSYCHE DULY
Small schools particularly 
seem to be getting into the spirit. 
The Colorado School of Mines, 
for example, has voted to boycott 
classes and canvass the commun
ity.
It will be particularly difficult 
for Nixon to ignore the protest if 
it comes, as is beginning to seem 
likely, from as wide a range of 
constituencies as students, uni
versity administrators, labor un
ions, some bussinessmen, and even 
some Republican members of 
Congress.
Senator Charles Godell, a 
Republican (NY), and Rep. Allard 
Lowenstein (D-NY) both have 
demanded that Congress set a 
time limit by which all U.S. 
troops must be withdrawn. Other 
members of Congress are endors
ing the proposals, including a cau
cus of Democrats who will sup
port the Moratorium and hope to 
make Congress unable to meet 
Oct. 15 due to a lack of a quor
um.
Nixon, in his news conferen
ce, said he thought the propos
als were too pessimistic. He said 
the well-intentioned proponents 
would force the U.S1 to continue 
its presence in Vietnam until 
the time limit (mid of late 1970) 
The proposals, however, actually 
set time limit date as the max
imum length of time the war ca 
continue; they left ample room 
for speedier withdrawal.
Of course, Nixon added, the 
proposals also* would stifle the 
U.S. in the Parish Peace Talks 
which still have not made sig
nificant progress.
The Presidents hopes that his 
token withdrawals and draft 
call reductions would satisfy 
the growing numbers who believe 
the war should have been stop
ped long ago (not to mention 
the continue to prosper, and the 
sincerity of the Presidents draft 
reductions continues to be 
challenged.
In answer to a reporters ques
tion concerning the intentional 
inflation of summer draft calls 
to allow for the timely reduc
tion in the draft this fall just in 
time to appease student unrest, 
Nixon responded, I dont con
sider that charge one of merit.
The figures indicate other
wise, and the National Council to 
Repeal the Draft has leveled the 
charge: Not only did summer
on War
draft calls this past summer run 
from 5,000 to 17,000 higher a 
month than in 1968, but draft 
calls toward the end of this sum
mer. And these calls came at a 
time when evidence was mounting 
that North Vietnam was cutting 
down its military offensive.
The draft call for July, 1968 
was 15,000 men; the call for July, 
1969 was 22,300 men. The call 
for August, 1968 was 18,300 
men; the call for August, 1969 
was 29,500 men. The call for 
September, 1968 was 12,200 
men; the call for September, 1969 
was 29,000 men.
And the call for October 1968 
was 13,800 men compared with 
a call of 29,000 for this October. 
This Octobers call will now be 
spread over a three-month period, 
for a monthly average of about 10, 
000. That monthly average is only 
slightly lower than the monthly 
call for September, 1968.
In fact, draft calls have in
creased 70 per cent to this date 
since Nixon announced his first 
Vietnam troop cutback in June.
But the President appears pleas
ed with himself. I think were 
on the right course in Vietnam. 
Were on a course that is going to 
end this war, he said in his 
press conference. It will end 
much sooner if we can have to 
an extent, the extent possible in 
this free country, a united front 
behind very reasonable proposals.
There may be a united front 
growing in this country, but it 
is not the front Nixon wants to 
see. Fall anti-war actions already 
slated are:
1. SDS national anti-war ac
tion in Chicago to coincide with 
the continuing trial of the Chi
cago Eight, October 8-11. This is 
the most militant and unpredic
table action planned.
2. The Vietnam Moratorium, 
class or work boycotts and ap
propriate non-violent protest 
actions, October 15, November 
14-15, etc. (adding a day each 
month until the war is stopped.)
3. The New Mobilization Com
mittees two - day death march 
from Arlington Cemetary to the 
Capitol November 13-14.
4. The New Mobilization Com
mittees national march to bring 
the troops home now, in Washing
ton, November 15. A second 
march is planned for San Fran
cisco the same day.
Protest
by DAVID MORRISON
Nixon has tried to convince 
the public he is ending the war 
by eliminating the draft for 
November and December and 
spreading Octobers call over 3 
months, as well as withdrawing
60.000 troops.
First, all Nixon did with the 
draft calls was bring them back 
down to slightly below the level 
for the latter half of 68. Even 
then, comparing June through De
cember 68 with 69, we see the 
cutback is actually a 30 per cent 
increase (See graph below).
As for troop withdrawal, at
60.000 per year it will take only
9 years to withdraw all the 
troops . Unfortunately, tricky 
Dick wont be around the White 
House by that time to take all the 
credit. Not only is 60,000 the 
exact number LBJ said could be 
withdrawn without reducing fight
ing strength, but according to a 
high ranking American official 
whose views have been heard 
personally by Mr. Nixon (Balti
more Sun, Sept. 16), 100,000
men could be pulled out without 
reducing the fighting ability of 
the allied forces. Why? It took
100.000 men to build the ports, 
ware houses, roads, logistical 
bases, outposts, and airports. 
Theyre all built now, so many 
men could be dispersed else
where in the world with no 
change in military operations.
What is more important is the 
number left  approximately 550, 
000 counting offshore ships and 
Thai bases. Apparently half of 
them are there to stay. Secre
tary of War Liard suggested 
U.S. forces could eventually be
cut in half to about 250,000 
men and kept in South Vietnam 
for an extended period. (Time 
Aug. 29).
So, what this all leads up to? 
A fancy PR job? Nixons not try
ing to hide the fact that lower
ing the draft call and replacing 
dear olde General Lew (hes 77 
and legally blind) was only to 
placate the college campus. 
And for the lottery system, it 
doesnt reform the draft, if any
thing could. It just changes the 
order of call so 19 year olds are 
drafted first  no doubt because 
theyre easier to exploit.
Whats Nixon up to ? In a 
remarkable manifestation of cry
stal clear perception Nixon said, 
I understand that there has been 
and continues to be opposition to 
the war in Vietnam in the na
tion. (N.Y. Times, Sept. 27; 
Commager letter ?ct. 2) He went 
on to proclaim his contempt 
for the democratic principle by 
concluding, Under no circum
stances will I be affected y it.
Actually Nixon doesnt know 
what to do. As I.F. Stone remark
ed, Heys thrashing about like 
a fish on a hood, trying desparately to find someway to get off. 
Hes vacillated on every policy 
question, from tax reform, through 
hunger to school desegregation. 
Even his appointments are not 
final, as Knowles knows. He 
changed his mind about the elec
toral college and then bombed out 
by having the Army drop the 
Green Beret case.
Lets let Nixon Know he HAS 
to change his policy. See you at 
the Moratorium March on Oct. 
15th.

into the victory column. With 
Tech trailing 10-6, CMU Line
backer John Sabol intercepted a 
pass on the Yoeman 23 yazrd 
line with 2:30 remaining. After a 
five yard penalty, Rudy Tepsic 
grabbed Rich Squires pass and 
was brought down on the one.
With the clock running, Squires 
handed off three successive times.
Terry Bell moved to the one-foot 
line, but then Tom Lombardo and 
Bell each lost a yeard trying the 
middle. With 1:05 remaining,
Squires forth down pass to bell 
was stopped for no gain.
With 28 seconds remaining,
Oberlin lined up in punt forma
tion and intentionally snapped 
the ball out of the endzone for a 
safety. This made it 10-8, but 
Yoeman coach Bill Grice figured 
it was better to have a free kick 
from the 20 than to risk a block
ed punt.
Earlier in the second half, an
other good scoring opportunity 
was halted by Oberlins de
fense. Tepsic broke loose over the 
middle and took Squires pass 50 
yards to the Oberlin 35. Charley 
Price swept right end for 11 
yards and Bell gained 10 more 
around the other side to the 14. But 
Squires went to the air unsuccess
fully from there and Tech lost 
the ball.
The Tartans jumped in front in 
the first quarter on a 47 yard drive.
Mike Kuhnel, subbing for injur
ed Tony Bugel at tight end, fol
lowed a wall of blockers into the 
end zone on an 18 yard screen 
pass. Mark Woods conversion 
attempt was blocked into the end 
zone on an 18 yard screen pass.
Mrk Woods Conversion attempt 
was blocked.
Oberlin came back with a 
35 yard drive following a short 
punt. John Davies elluded three 
defenders on a 16 yard scoring 
pass from Jim Owens. Steve Ash
tons kick made it 7-6.
With four seconds remaining in 
the first half, Ashton kicked a 
wind-aided, 38 yard field goal for 
Oberlins final score of the af
ternoon.
CMUs pass rush was particul
arly effective, hitting Oberlin 
QBs Dan Duffy and Owen for 
numerous losses. The Yoemen 
completed only 13 of 30 and had 
3 intercepted, two by sabol. One 
on the Ground, Oberlin runners 
gained only 60 yards on 50 at
tempts.
Rich Squires had a better pas
sing day than his 16-40 comletion mark indicates. Many of his 
passes that were right on the 
mark were dropped by his re
ceivers. Bell, running mostly in
side in contrast to last week, was 
the games leading ground-gainer with 16 tries good for 48 yds.
This Saturday, CMU battles 
the always tough Westminster 
Titans. The last time a Tech grid 
team took the trip to New Wil
mington was in 1967 when West
minster was 8-0, and ranked in 
the small college top ten.
But Tom Hubka and Co. put to
gether a super effort and won 41- 
34 in probably the biggest upset 
in district football for the last 
ten years. Game time for the 
Westminster homecoming is 1:30 
and student buses will be provid
ed. Reservations can be made in am r'wl E5'I5

When the Tartans play a football game, weve come to expect 
the unexpected. And Saturdays game at Oberlin was no exception. 
The defense, which looked so vulnerable against Thiel last week, was 
tough all day  especially on crucual third down and short yardage 
situations. The Tech offense, which rolled up 400 yards a week ago, 
scored in the opening quarter and was shut out the rest of the way.
A defensive line led by Buzzard, Meilahn, Helhowski and Weakland, was so effective in shutting off the Oberlin ground game that the 
Yoemen were forced to abandon their minimal passing offense and put 
the ball in the air 30 of the 69 plays. The big D also picked off 
three passes and recovered two fumbles; however, with ineffective 
blocking, dropped passes and timely penalities leading the way, the 
Tartans were unable to put enough points on the scoreboard. The loss of 
co-captain Tony Bugel for this game was another factor which help
ed take some of the strength out of a potentially powerful CMU of
fense.
800 screaming Obie partisans filled the stands for their home
coming football game. Since it was a big weekend there, a home grown 
pep band was formed Wednesday to perform for their alumni. They 
never showed up so their cheerleaders were left with the task of pro
viding1 the half time entertainment. The scoreboard provided a two 
minute moraturium for the game when it decided to shut itself off 
during the third quarter.

The officials, unaware that they were at the Oberlin field, hand
ed out 80 yards in penalities to the visiting Tartans and penalized the 
hosts for a total of 30 yards..........The nature of the game is well illus
trated by the punting stats  The Tartans were forced to boot the ball
eleven times and the Yoemen had ten punts...........The Tartans have
two tough games coming up at Westminster and Allegheny before re
turning to Tech for the Homecoming contest against F & M. Both 
the Titans and Gators have been victims of Tech upset victories in 
the past two years and it will take supreme performances by the en
tire CMU team to repeat those wins this year.

Halfway through the opening 
quarter, CMU scored the first 
goal of the game on a breakaway 
by co-captain Palme. He took a 
throw-in and, outrunning the 
Western Reserve defense, drove 
for the goal and slipped the 
ball past the goalie. But Western 
Reserve came back immediately 
after the kickoff. CMU goalie,
Jacques Borisewitz, blocked a 
shot and when the ball got away,
Western Reserve tapped it into 
an undefended goal.
CMU charged for the Western 
Reserve goal just after the second 
quarter kickoff. Palme drew a 
penalty and easily put the free 
kick in to put CMU ahead 2-1. For 
the remainder of the quarter 
CMU had two more shots on 
goal but neither team really con
trolled the action.
Most of the action in the third 
quarter in the middle of the field 
with neither team mounting a 
steady offense. But one play 
that brought the scanty crowd to 
its feet was a save by Jake 
Eisenman. A Western Reserve 
player broke away and was ra
cing for the goal. Just as he was 
about to shoot Eisenman came out 
of nowhere to knock the shot 
away. With less than a minute to 
go the officials threw a Western 
Reserve player out of the game.
This started a running verbal 
battle that raged throughout the 
rest of the game.
At the beginning of the last 
quarter Jerry Candiliotis took a 
corner kick and slid it past the 
Western Reserve goalie to make 
it 3-1. Then Candiliotis scored a 
second time from close range to 
end CMUs scoring. Western Re
serve then blew an almost sure 
goal when they missed a penalty 
kick. Palme gave the last offen
sive thrust for CMU when he 
again broke away from the pack 
but his shot hit the goal post.
With two and a half minutes 
to go. Western Reserve got their 
last goal on a hard shot that 
Birisewitz caught, but he fell 
back into the goal with the ball.
CMU goes after its third win 
this Wednesday at St. Vincent.

H & SS
(Continued from Page 1)
Poge 8  THE TARTAN  Tuesday, October 7, 1969
al, would be a further study in
to one of the three areas. In ad
dition, non-professional followup courses would be offered as 
studio elective for H & SS ma
jors. A petition was circulated 
in support of this program.
The ciUwSntFwk task force 
group divided their area into two 
kinds of counseling  voca
tional and personal. Stu
dents indicated that there was a 
need for freshmen counseling at 
registration. One suggestion was 
that departments list the names 
of faculty willing to meet and 
advise students.
That upperclassmen should 
communicate with freshmen about 
couses and programs, either in 
formal or informal atmospheres, 
was another proposal suggested 
by the group.
Every student should have a 
faculty advisor, was the opin
ion of the majority.
The group further recommended 
that there be a faculty evaluation, 
a pamphlet indicating how to adddrop courses etc., and classes for 
faculty to inform them what is 
going on so that they may, in 
turn, inform their students.
For personal counseling the 
group urged the college to pub
licize the existence of the Coun
seling Center on the third floor 
of Baker Hall.
Some ,Tnn SngFw-TS are go
ing well; others are not, com
mented the secretary of the group. 
Although she said there was no 
sure way to generate success, 
her committee recommended 
that each seminar draw up a list 
of what things made successful 
meetings and did not work ef
fectively. This compliation will 
be made available to all groups 
in the hope that they will im
prove them.
A question was raised as to 
what happened to the $100 or
iginally appropriated for each 
seminar group. Dean Steinberg 
asked what the money was to be 
used for and how that figure was 
arrived upon.
The amount, it was reported, 
was given to the experimental 
free seminars conducted last 
year. It would be used for pro
jects and entertaining students 
in their preceptors homes, was 
a faculty members reply.
The cUTTFMUtUg ciggFCCnn
drew the largest number of stu
dents and faculty; the group split 
into two smaller sections to dis
cuss the many problems with the 
current program.
The first group suggested that 
instead of the present required 
courses, students should be per
mitted to take courses among 
various selections within certain 
areas.
Another suggestion was that 
the. other colleges create cour
ses for non-professional students.
Dean Hayes commented that 
there should be flexibility within 
courses and not between cour
ses. A student replied that the 
Historical Understanding and 
Literary Imagination courses 
werw worthless because of the 
system they are in.
One student asked a history 
professor, What is the purpose of 
the Historical Understanding 
course?
I wish I knew, he replied.
The report of the second group 
proposed the 32 unspecified 
course program mentioned above.
One group met on the prob
lem of the NFSCiTFM-t awvnTl
SC-wvFwk Course. The group re
ported that H & SS students 
should make up their own sec
tions because CIT students were 
often not interested in the ma
terial and tended to make the
class drag. They also recom
mended that instead of studying 
three to four topics per semester, 
that the first three weeks of the 
course should be spent introdu
cing each of these areas. Then 
the student should choose one of 
these topics to spend a semester 
on.
The Teaching Committee re
ported that teaching should be 
concerned with methods and 
facts. They said that teachers 
should not be forced to teach 
courses they do not want to teach, 
and that there should be no class 
attendance requirements.
The quality of teaching should 
be more sophisticated, they re
commended. In addition, faculty 
should be chosen on the basis of 
their teaching ability, rather than 
on their research.
qhT-vFwk prostitutes the learn
ing process, opened the next 
committee report. The group said 
that no grades should be given 
on work handed in, that papers 
should be optional, and that Uni
versity money should be spent on 
better teachers rather than on bet
ter facilities.
A student should have three 
options, reported the committee. 
He may either choose a letter 
grade, a pass-fail grade, or an 
evalution profile sheet given the 
teachers comments on the stu
dents growth and, also, the stu
dents comments on his own 
growth.
Concerning the lack of col
lege identity, the group sugges
ted tiat a lounge be set up just 
for H & SS students. Although 
there was some disagreement 
about a separate lounge, a com
mittee Am > formed to investigate 
various visibilities, including 
Dean Steinbergs offer of the 
lounge on the first floor of Mar
garet Morrison.
The suggestion was also pro
posed that a student be repre
sented on the H & SS College 
Council.
Another committee met on 
knwnT-t ki-tS of the College.
They reported that students should 
be permitted to take independ
ent study projects, that student 
designed courses should be in
stituted, and that a degree should 
be granted in general studies.
The school is not fulfilling 
its goals, was the opening state
ment. After we made this obser
vation, we tried to determine just 
what those goals are. The integra
tion of science and art is a legi
timate goal, was the com
mittees option.
After the Committee Reports, 
Dr. Joel Goldstein, moderator of 
the meeting, suggested that the 
group set up some mechanism 
by which to institute the var
ious suggestions.
Several issues were debated on 
the floor. One student felt very 
strongly that students should be 
given the power to determine the 
course of the new college. Al
though he was frequently told that 
not even Dean Steinberg had the 
power to change the direction and 
that it lay in the hands of the 
Board of Trustees, the student 
argued that it was actually the 
Deans that made a lot of the im
portant decisions. Many faculty 
agreed that their suggestions 
had been ignored in the two years 
of discussion about the formation 
of the new college.
Who has the power? was ask
ed by both the students and fac
ulty alike. The Board of Trus
tees who chartered the school, 
was the official answer.
It was agreed that the issues 
raised at the meeting should not 
be droped and that meetings 
such as the Saturday one should 
be continued, at least one per 
semester.
The group agreed to Dean 
Hayes suggestion that each 
committee report be compliled 
into one major document for fu
ture reference.
Many of the Committees will 
be meeting this week to further 
discuss and evaluate, and perhaps 
attempt to enforce, their sugges
tions.
