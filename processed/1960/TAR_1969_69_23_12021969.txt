Pentagon Draws Dates 
For Year's Draft Call
Yesterday, the Pentagon first drew dates to determine which men 
will be drafted under the new lottery system made possible by Senate 
action Nov. 19. The drawing took place in time to fill January's draft 
quota.
Under the new system, all draft eligible men should have a least an 
equal two chances in three to escape military service in the coming 
year. The Pentagon reports that it will have 800,000 men available for 
the first years lotterthat includes all eligible males 19 to 26 years 
old. Of the total, it expects to draft about 250,000. according to Defense 
Secretary Melvin Laird.
This tentative draft call for 1970 is only 40,000 men fewer than the 
Vietnam war-time call for the year just ending when 289,000 were in
ducted. The tentative figures are open to change as the year progresses, 
however. And the Pentagon has already made plans to reduce the orig
inal draft call for January which was scheduled to a very high 35.000 
men. (Calls for the last three months have been only 9 to 10,000 men in 
comparison.)
Under the lottery, men will be vulnerable to the draft for only one 
year rather than for six years from their 19th to 26th birthdays. After 
the first year only 19 year olds will be subjected to the lottery.
Student deferments will remain in effect. A student who is drafted 
during his 19th year will not be inducted until he has finished under
graduate college. During the first year of the lottery graduate students 
called are expected to be allowed to finish the term in which they are 
enrolled before being inducted.
After the lotterys first year, graduate students should not be af
fected by the draft, for only 19 year olds will be in the pot.
Trustees Approve End 
For MMCC Programs
The Executive Committee of the 
Board of Trustees at C-MU has 
approved the recommendation of 
the University's Faculty Senate 
that no more students be admit
ted in four programs in Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College.
The program, to be discontinued 
after 1973 when this year's fresh
men class will graduate, include 
business studies, textiles and 
clothing, foods and nutrition, and 
home economics education.
At the same time C-MU Presi
dent Guyford Stever announced 
the establishment of committee of 
faculty, students and alumnae 
charged with making recommen
dations for the future of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College and 
professional education for women 
on the C-MU campus.
Reasons for the decision to dis
continue these programs, reach
ed after many months of discus
sion by faculty, students and ad
ministration. include steadily de
clining enrollment, the inability to
attract the needed teacher-scholars to replace senior people who 
will be retiring in the next three 
years, and the failure of many 
steps taken since the early 1950s 
to generate interest in the pro
grams.
According to Dr. Stever, Since 
World War II junior colleges have 
expanded greatly their offerings 
and enrollments in business and 
secretarial studies, and figures 
show that students seem to be go
ing primarily to state-supported 
colleges and universities to study 
home economics, perhaps partly 
because of lower tuition. So strong 
is the trend that in the last 20 
years many private colleges have 
had to close their home economics 
departments.
Listing some of the steps taken 
since the early 1950s to increase 
interest in these fields. Dr. Stev
er concluded that all of this 
seems not to have helped. Enroll
ment has continued to down. With 
enrollment so low. with most of
our senior faculty retiring in the 
next four years and with our ef
forts to recruit new faculty being 
unproductive, there seems to be 
no resonable alternatives. I have 
instructed the Admissions Office, 
therefore, not to accept applicants 
next fall for business studies, tex
tiles and clothing, foods and nutri
tion, and home economics educa
tion.
It is vital, Dr. Stever contin
ued, that we continue to have sig
nificant numbers of women study
ing at C-MU. We have a substan
tial number of women in the new 
College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences, the College of Fine Arts, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
and those in Margaret Morrison 
about 1,000 underaduates now. We 
want to make sure that such an 
appropriate balance in enrollment 
is maintained and that we offer 
women superiod educational pro
grams. To that end we are now 
bending our attention and our en
ergies.
Faculty Senate Discusses Disciplinary Codes
The Conference Committee on 
Campus Codes, which has been 
meeting since early October to de
velop a new campus disciplinary 
code, was discussed at the Faculty 
Senate meeting of Nov. 11. This 
sub-committee of the Student Af
fairs Council consists of Dean 
Swank, Profs. S. Bern, Day. and 
Rothfus, and student representa
tives Patrick Cavangh. Larry 
Welsh and Dave Ringler.
So far the committee has been 
dealing only with the judicial as
pect of the new Undergraduate 
Code which was submitted to the 
Student Affairs Council and the 
Student Senate in draft form last 
May. The Conference Committee, 
reported Prof. Day, has placed a 
priority on trying to develop new 
judicial procedures.
As a substitute for suggestions 
on judicial procedures offered in 
the Undergraduate Code, Pat Cavanagh introduced to the commit
tee a new proposal called the Uni
versity Code of Discipline. The
proposes a single University court 
and a bill of rights which would 
apply equally to all facets of the 
campus community. This concept 
of symmetry is based on the stu
dents conception of the campus 
community as a democratic socie
ty. This proposal was discussed 
by both the Conference Committee 
and the Executive Committee of 
the Faculty Senate.
At its last meeting the Execu
tive Committee concluded the fol
lowing: (1) Probably there are 
some rules pertaining to campus 
life that could have a symmetri
cal basis, such as forbidding any
one to carry firearms; (2) In 
other ways, the different compon
ents of the campus community are 
not at all symmetrical, e.g., what 
punishment would be appropriate 
for each group even if guilty of a 
similar crime such as carrying 
weapons on campus? (3) The con
cept of an adversary system would
Breslin To Lecture
Most of his high school class became bookies or auto mechanics. A 
tew went to college. He wasn't one of them. He was the one who cam
paigned for City Council President in the streets of New York  in a 57 
Chevy minus its shock absorbers that scraped bottom at every turn.
This is the brash and self-assertive Jimmy Breslin who will be 
speaking in Pittsburgh at Duquesne University on Wednesday. Dec. 3. 
at 3:15 p.m. in the Union Ballroom. This internationally syndicated col
umnist and author has directed his attention to the problems of the in
ner city, of organized crime, and of modern suburbia. He approaches 
these problems with great irreverence and a health cynicism.
This lecture, sponsored by the Duquesne Union Forum Committee, 
is tree and open to the public. All are welcome to attend.

not be desirable for the Universi
ty, especially in matters affecting 
academic affairs. In this area, 
the Executive Committee had 
some alternative suggestions 
which they asked Prof. Day to 
take to the students on the Confer
ence Committee for consideration. 
These include: (a) All future 
course offerings should be listed 
with the name of the instructors 
who will teach the course; (b) The 
faculty and administration should 
support and encourage students 
in a thorough course evaluation 
process for all departments (c) 
An ombudsman should be chosen 
to serve as an intermediary in 
special cases where students do 
not feel that they have proper 
communicaiion with faculty in 
academic matters.
Prof. Day reported that at the 
last meeting of the committee, 
students seemed encouraged by 
the Executive Committee sugges
tion that some limited aspects of 
campus life might be treated sym
metrically. even though there is 
no agreement by the faculty rep
resentatives on the applicability 
of this concept in the academic 
area. Discussions on this will con
tinue in the Conference Commit
tee.
Prof. Langer explained that 
what the Executive Committee 
had suggested to Prof. Day was 
that the students be offered non
judicial techniques for achieving 
academic reform  techniques 
which would not threaten academ
ic freedom in the classroom.
Prof. Day added that the Stu
dent Senate had supported the 
Cavangh plan (Senate Minutes,
Nov. 4).
Dean Swank stated that he 
would like to put the following ac
tions of tne students into the con
text of previous events. The orig
inal move by Student Senate to
back the Cavangh proposal came 
right after the Spet. 23 demonstra
tion when it became clear that 
there was no disciplinary action 
for faculty that would guarantee 
them due process, although it was 
clear that due process would be 
observed for students. Also, there 
was a version of the same motion 
in the Minutes of the Student Sen
ate meeting of Sept. 30. The move 
on Nov. 4 was a reinforcement of 
instructions for the students sit
ting on the Committee and should 
be viewed as a political move to
strengthen their representatives 
on the committee. Student Senate 
is now saying, said Dean Swank, 
that they will participate in the 
study, but they wish to review the 
process to be evolved for every
one who breaks a common regula
tion.
Dean Swank agreed with a sug
gestion from Chairman Langer 
that after the Conference Commit
tee comes to some decision on a 
proposal for a new judicial pro
cess, a joint Faculty-Student Sen
ate meeting might be very helpful.
Th ree Days Planned 
For Next Moratorium
The Vietnam Moratorium Committee continues to make good its 
pledge of an additional day of protest each month until the war is ended.
Decembers third Moratorium will be three days long. And al
though there will be no attempt to equal the spectacle of the mid-No
vember mass protest, there will be a central theme: Christmas.
Traditionally, Christmas has been a time when people turn their 
attention to peace on earth, said Sam Brown, one of the Moratorium's 
four coordinators. This year, in addition to turning their attention to 
peace on earth, they will be asked to turn their energies to this task.
Individual community efforts are again being stressed with public 
meetings, visits to military bases, and talks with congressmen being 
encouraged. Specific organization is being left to the local communities.
For the first time the Moratorium dates will not be successive. 
There will be two days of mid-month anti-war activity, Dec. 12 and 13, 
with the third day of protest scheduled for Christmas Eve.
As during the first two Moratorium days, there will be public ralies in Washington, D. C. And the idea of demonstrating for peace on the 
eve of the celebration of Christs birth could continue to bring more of 
the silent peace people into the streets, this time for a silent night peace vigil.
There is hope that President Nixon will announce another, perhaps 
significant troop withdrawal shortly before Christmas, despite the Ad
ministrations continuing statements that anti-war demonstrations do not affect him.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOREDITORIAL
We applaud the one sentence resolution passed by 
Congress November 19 which created the new lottery system 
by which men will now be drafted. Apparently, however, the 
system has not been made sufficiently clear.
Briefly, every male between the ages of 19 and 26 will 
be subject to the new lottery system this year. Whether or not 
presently enrolled students will have to serve after they com
plete their undergraduate education will also be determined. 
Next year, only 19 year olds will be affected. This means that 
those who are presently between 19 and 26 years old have less 
of a chance of being inducted since there are more people per 
birthday from which local draft boards will select. In other 
words, depending upon the size of future draft calls, less of the 
list selected on Monday will be called up to serve in the arm
ed forces.
The drawing on Monday established a priority list of 366 
days. It is projected that males whose birthdays fall in the first 
third of the list may count on being inducted. Those in the 
middle third will have to wait out the year, as their induc
tion depends upon the number of monthly draft calls. Those in 
the bottom thifd will probably not have to serve at all, unless 
there is a national emergency.
When a draft call for a particular month is announced, 
local draft boards will be expected to fill their quotas. 
After volunteers, those men inducted will be chosen according 
to the list drawn Monday. The local draft board will take all 
men whose birthdays fall on the first date drawn, then the sec
ond date, etc. until the quota is met. The order within a parti
cular date will be decided alphabetically, according to random 
slection of 26 letters.
A student who is inducted may complete his undergrad
uate education, but must serve as soon as his deferment ex
pires.
There are several benefits in this new system. There is now 
only one year of vulnerability, as opposed to the previous 
seven years. The youngest are called first (after this first year 
when all ages are vulnerable), and there is random selection. 
In addition, the powerful local draft boards will lose much of 
their authority; they will become the mere processors of induc
tees and appeals boards. They no longer will be able to hand 
pick who gets drafted and when.
The question of involuntary servitude remains to be solved 
in future years. Senate critics of the lottery system who advoca
ted stronger draft reforms decided not to oppose the sys
tem, as they apparantly found it an improvement over the 
old one which kept men dangling from the Selective Services 
whimsical strings for years.
Lottery sponsors and Senator John Stennis (D-Miss.), 
Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have agreed that 
the committee will continue to investigate more extensive 
draft reform during the next session.
Among the changes we hope the committee will con
sider are the creation if an all-volunteer army, revisions in 
deferments for conscientious objectors, and the equity of the 
present apportionment of the jurisdictions of local draft 
boards.

Auden To Read Poetry; 
Judy Collins To Sing
The International Poetry For
um will present W. H. Auden 
and Judy Collins in its Decem
ber program. Mr. Auden will read 
his own poetry on Wednesday. 
December 3. at 8:30 p.m. Miss 
Collins will perform in concert 
Friday. December 12. at 8:30 
p.m. Both events will be held in 
the Carnegie Music Hall.
Mr. Auden, recipient of the 
Pulitzer Prize, is the author of 
numerous volumes of poetry, in
cluding About the House, Ho
mage to Clio, The Age of An
xiety, and Nones. He has also 
edited many anthologies, includ
ing the Oxford Books of Light 
Verse and Poets of the English 
Language. In addition, he has 
authored several books of essays, 
librettos and has collaborated with 
Christopher Isherwood on sever
al plays, including The Dog 
Beneath the Skin and On The 
Frontier.
W. H. Auden was born in 
York. England in 1907. He has 
been a resident of the United 
States since 1939. and an Ameri
can citizen since 1946. Educated 
at Gresham s School. Holt and at 
Christ Church. Oxford, he became 
associated with a small group of 
young writers in London, includ
ing Stephen Spender and Isher
wood. who were to be recogniz
ed as the most promising writers 
of their generation.
Judy Collins is often referred 
to as America's foremost singer of 
contemporary art songs and re
cently as an important writer of 
songs. During the ten years that 
Judy Collins has been singing 
professionally she has explored 
each significant change in the
current renaissance of folk music. 
After beginning her career as a 
singer of traditional Anglo-Am
erican ballads. Miss Collins turn
ed in the early 1960s to contem
porary songs of social commen
tary. Music and poe try can pro
duce a catharsis that involves 
everybody." she says. 'That's what 
I'm after."
Judy Marjorie Collins was born 
on May 1. 1939. in Seattle. Wash
ington. the daughter of a blind, 
radio master of ceremonies. She 
began taking piano lessons at 
seven and was soon considered 
something of a child prodigy. 
The Collins family moved to 
Denver and Judy studied piano 
under Antonia Brica. a former stu
dent of Sibelius, and her life was 
dominated by preparations for a 
career as a concert pianist. 
(Her studies were interrupted 
for a time by attacks of polio and 
tubercular pleurisy.) at sixteen, 
however, she rebelled against the 
rigorous discipline of lessons and 
six-hour practice sessions, and 
quit. She soon began learning to 
play the guitar. Judy Collins 
sang before her first large 
audience at seventeen. After grad
uating from high school, she at
tended MacMurray College in Ill
inois. and then returned to Den
ver where she enrolled in the Uni
versity of Colorado. Her involve
ment with folk music deepened 
and in 1959 she started singing 
in clubs in Colorado. She bagan 
singing in Chicago. Cambridge 
and New York City. While appear
ing at the Village Gate in 1961. 
she was discovered by an exe
cutive of Electra Records who 
signed her to a contract.
In 1965. Miss Collins made her 
New York Carnegie Hall debut. 
Since then, she has performed all 
over the world, has given con
certs and benefits for civil rights. 
Vietnam war protests and the 
draft resistance. She has also 
worked to aid black voter regis
tration.
Miss Collins considers the find
ing of suitable material her 
most demanding job ... I think 
there is a music coming out of 
this culture, a real kind of tradi
tion being written. What I'm 
trying to do is to find songs that 
are the key points of our civiliza
tion."

Pentag
Foreign Grants Open to Students
The C-MU YM-YWCA is or
ganizing students and faculty to 
debate national issues in area 
high schools. Presently, business 
and government organizations 
are thp primary suppliers of speak
ers, films and literature of the 
schools.
The result is very little oppor
tunity for critical examination of 
the issues. Vietnam and the role 
of the military in society are 
certainly the main concerns, but 
drugs, the generation gap. the 
role of women, the race crisis 
are also of concern to high school 
students.
Many students are looking for 
opportunities to hear and discuss 
dissenting points of view. While 
there is much to be done on this 
campus, there is a real need to 
provide opportunities for open 
discussion in the public schools. 
Stop in the Y Office. 57 Skibo, 
to help organize and make your 
opinions heard.
Two awards for foreign study 
are now open to C-MU students. 
The R. J. Cameron Grant is av
ailable to a senior male student 
who has made arrangements for 
a year of study abroad, has com
pleted his financing, and will 
benefit from additional funds. The 
Vera Heinz Award, established 
in 1967. will enable a woman stu
dent to travel abroad between 
her junior and senior years.
The procedure for the R. J. 
Cameron Grant is as follows: 
Each applicant shall during the 
first part of his senior year pre
pare a prospectus showing his 
plan for study abroad and the ar
rangements he has already made 
to implement those plans. With 
his perspectus should be submit
ted a transcript of his grades, a 
letter of recommendation from his 
department head, a photograph, 
and a biographical sketch. Also 
he must notify the selection Com
mittee as soon as he has been ac
cepted for study at the univer
sity of his choice.
These application materials 
should be taken to the Financial

Noon Forum
Middle America. sometimes 
known as the silent majority, 
will be the topic of Mr. Emil 
Narick, former general counsel 
of the United Steel Workers of 
America, at the Y's Thursday Lun

in the Wherrett Room. He will re
flect. from the vantage point of 
an officer in a large, industrial 
and sometimes progressive union, 
on where a dominant segment of 
working people stand today in 
their social and political at
titudes.
If one of the behaviors of the 
silent majority is to engage in 
backlash, Mr. Narick may him
self have been the victim of it. 
He was the unsuccessful candi

South Vietnamese Calls for End to
SAIGON (CPS)  The following 
introduction and accompanying 
letter were received through 
peace movement channels in Can
ada. The introduction is by Wilf 
Allen, a volunteer worker with the 
YMCA stationed here.
Le Van Nghia, the author of 
the following letter is a 24 year 
old, third year student at the Fac
ulty of Letters, Saigon Universi
ty, and (is) editor of the school 
newspaper. The previous editor 
is now serving five years hard la
bor on the notorious prison island 
of Con Son as a result of his in
volvement with the paper last 
year.
One senses that to Nghia. who 
is a cripple, courage comes nat
urally. He is a native of Ben Tre. 
the southern town made famous 
during the Tet offensive, when an 
American commander delivered 
the epitaph, It became necessary
to destroy the town to save it. As 
I talked to Nghia and some of the 
papers staff, I became foreceably aware that the one thing that 
matters to these students is to 
bring an end to the war. I was ask
ed, How would you feel if a great
er power than the U.S. occupied 
your land?
The face huge obstacles in 
their efforts to seek peace. Gov
ernment suppression of their ac
tivities and persecution for their 
views is a grim threat to live 
with. Since Law 10-69 was passed 
last year prohibiting assemblies 
of more than three people, says one 
student. No one knows exactly 
how many students have been ar
rested. but there have been very 
many.
Hundreds of students, now in 
prison, never hope to see a trial. 
Many of them are moved from 
prison to prison to prevent them
from forming any contacts with 
the aoutside world. To their fami
lies and friends they often simply 
cease to exist.
I am told that it is not uncom
mon to have some families with 
four or five sons and daughters in 
prison.' Two men are pointed out 
on the street outside the office; 
They follow us when we go any
where.' They consider it a matter 
of time before the government 
decides something we have print
ed is too strong and comes and ar
rests us.' A special probelm is the 
police inofrmers who pose as stu
dents.
The game they are playing is 
as real as the violence of the war 
that is going on around them and 
the stakes they are putting up 
against the price of peace can in
clude thier lives. Le Van Nghia s 
letter to the American students is 
a sincere representation of the 
feelings and hopes of the Vietna
mese student community. '
The letter reads as follows:
"To our American Student 
Friends.
Dear Friends.
"I am writing these lines from 
Southern Vietnam, from a land
which is like a furnace resound
ing with bullets and bombs, blood, 
fire and sudden death.
"The frightening circumstances 
of war are with us daily, but we 
know we still have some Ameri
can friends, the brothers of those 
who are forced to come here and 
shed their blood shed their blood 
and meet a tragic death. If the 
warfare does not end. I worry 
about the fate of mv people, and I 
also endlessly have painful 
thoughts about you. Maybe you 
will be foreced to come over here, 
following the steps of your older 
friends. What will happen? I am 
moved and I want to crv.
"My American friends!
"Vietnamese students look up
on you with affection and full of 
hopefulness. The students of 
southern Vietnam admire your 
work. You have dared to struggle, 
to demonstrate, and to call on the 
American government to end the 
war in Vietnam.
"You have requested the gov
ernment to bring home your be
loved American youth to end the 
useless sacrifices of blood, to 
avoid the destrictuon of a friend
ly country by sowing the seeds of

Think selfishly about your 
own career before you decide 
on one with Du Pont.
Be selfish. But be honest.
Youve put in a lot of tough years 
to get your degree. Your allegiance 
lies with a professional discipline.
Why, then, must you decide now 
to plight your trust to a company 
for life? Dont. Join a company 
first. If it doesnt 
advance you within that 
professional discipline, 
well, youre not 
married to it
Many have found career 
enrichment at Du Pont. This comes 
from being handed a ball and 
being expected to run with it. From 
working with top people, from 
growing in a company where the 
opportunities are always wide open 
and the projects are often way out.
Many have found professional 
fulfillment and have built a very full, 
varied and happy life as Du Ponters.
Others have found, after working 
at Du Pont, that their professional 
interest lay in teaching, in further 
study or in an industry that 
offered even wider scope in their 
particular discipline. All of these 
men left Du Pont far better qualified 
professionally than when they came.
So talk to the Du Pont recruiter. 
If he offers you something, think 
of it as a professional challenge, not 
a proposal of marriage.

Basketball Starts Tomorrow; 
Titans Here For CM Opener

Swimmers Splash Down 
Saturday Afternoon
By Scott Miller
New Swimming team coach Steve Fagan is candidly optimistic 
about the success of this years squad. Barring any injuries, the Tar
tan swimmers could compile a record of seven wins and four losses, 
a vast improvement over last years winless season. Coach Fagan is 
already aware of the stiff competition the Tartans will be up against 
this season; last year Mr. Fagan was a senior letter winner on Slip
pery Rock State Colleges tough varsity swim team, whom Tech will 
meet here next February 17.
The CMU basketball team 
will open its season tomorrow 
night at the Tech gym at 8:15. 
There opponents will be West
minster. Four letter winners 
have graduated from last years 
team; however, the Tartans have 
hopes of improving on last sea
sons record of 8-13.
The probable starting lineup 
for the opener will have Bob 
Brown and Ian Von Lindern in the 
backcourt, captain Bill Abraham 
and Dave Stobbe at forwards and 
Bill Weborg at Center.
Bob Grazzini and Devin Cot
ter are the top reserves up front 
who will have a good chance of 
breaking into the starting five. 
Other reserves at the forward posi
tions who should see lots of ac
tion are Frank Westmeyer, Mike 
Conrad and Sherman Long who
are up from last years JV. The 
reserves at guard include Flet
cher Hardiman. Tony Wright, Ed 
Aul and Jeff Hollis. Hardimann 
who was the varsity squad last 
season and the others plaved JV 
ball.
This will be the first time in 
five years that the Tech boxscores will not include the name of 
Mark Lang. Mark finished his 
career at CMU as the second 
highest scorer ever with 1301 
points. He holds school records 
for the most field goals in a game, 
18; in a season, 159; and in a 
career, 550. His 969 rebounds is 
second to Andy Comer. Langs uni
form was retired at the final game 
last year and he received the 
alumni award this fall.
Replacing Lange as the team 
leader is sophomore Bob Brown.
Bob averaged 18 points per game 
last season and has looked unstop
pable in the preseason games this 
year. Along side Brown is junior 
guard Ian Von Lindern. Armed 
with a deadly outside shot. Von 
Lindern is also a tough defen
sive player.
Among the forwards, Grazzini 
was the only one to hit for an 
average in double figures last year. 
Also, his 181 rebounds were sec
ond on the team to Lang's 275. 
Abraham, who was elected captain 
of the 1969-70 squad, averaged 
almost nine points per game last 
year and was the only Tartan to 
sink 50 per cent of his shots 
from the field Weborg. who scor
ed 7-4 points per game, and Stob
be, like to shoot from the outside. 
The Stork was also third in re
bounding for the Tartans. The 
tallest Tartans are Frank West
meyer and Grazzini who are both 
66".
The CMU squad will have two 
obstacles which they must over
come in order to have a success
ful season. One problem is bring
ing the ball past midcourt when 
faced with a full court press. 
The other is a schedule which has 
only nine home contests in 23 
games. That will be hard to change 
this year.
The Tartans lost two heartbreakers to Westminster last 
year by scores of 59-58 and 83-78. 
The second game of the season is 
also at home as the Tartans bat
tle Grove City Saturday even
ing. There will be a junior var
sity game in the prelim Satur
day.
Jeff LaRochelle, Bob McIn
tyre. and Lloyd Miller are three 
Tech veterans who will be de
pended upon for individual wins. 
Jeff has been the top butterflier 
for the Tartans the past two sea
sons, but his position is being 
seriously threatened by speedy 
freshman Jim McCafferty.
Boby McIntyre is probably 
the most versatile swimmer on the 
squad. Last year he swam the 
500 and 1000 yard freestyle, the
400 yard freestyle relay, and in 
one meet was one of the Tech 
divers. Bob was Carnegies top 
individual winner in 1968-69 and 
Aoach Fagan feels there is no rea
son why he shouldn't be able to 
repeat that feat again.
Sophomore Lloyd Miller is the 
strong man in the breastroke and 
individual medley events. Al
ready this season he has come
close to breaking team records 
in these events. And with four 
months remaining until the PennOhio competition in March, sev
eral school records could also be 
broken.
One of the freestyles regulars, 
Andy Beal, is a doubtful starter 
for the first meet against West
minster at home December 6. 
Dave Lowry is a freshman with 
promise at the backstroke, and 
Jim Sivak and Derek Lentz are 
two other freshmen who will be 
helping Dave to strengthen thatposition.
Rounding out the squad are 
Steve Freeman, Tim Mehl. Norm 
Crapster, Bill Moult and Kent 
Schanke. complementing Mc
Intyre and Beal in all of the in
dividual and realy freestyle events. 
Tom Monego and John Minarik 
are the other breastrokers for 
the Tartans.
Diving has usually been a weak 
spot for Carnegie because of the 
small number of individuals 
who are capable of diving com
petitively. Scott Provan and Lar
ry Lawson may be able to give 
Coach Fagan an unexpected gift 
if they can succeed in chalk
ing up some points in this 
event.
Be sure to follow the swim team 
throughout the season. Compe
titive swimming is a sport which 
demands an unusually high capa
city of mental and physical en
durance as a prerequisite for win
ning. You can show your support 
for the team by showing up at the 
Tech pool at 2:00 p.m. . Satur
day, December 6, when the Tar
tan swimmers will face West
minster.

BOB BROWN DRIVES towards basket in last years game against 
Western Reserve. Brown averaged 17.9 points per game during the 68- 
69 season and will be counted upon for his scoring ability again 
this year.

again this year and is eligible to 
play next year. Possible replace
ments at the various line positions 
are Dan Buis. Brian Crowley and 
George Pavlik.
Replacing Bugel at the tight 
end position will probably be either 
Mike Kuhnel or Mark Wood. Kuhnel filled in for Bugel while he 
was hurt. Wood handled the punt
ing and placement kicking this 
season.
Next years outlook appears 
good considering the number of 
starters that will be returning. 
Substitutes saw a lot of action 
because of injuries and gained 
some experience. A new crop of 
freshmen will add depth to the 
squad as the Tartans take the 
field in 1970.

The 1969 CMU football team compiled a 4-4 record and 
won all the aggregate offensive statistics from their op
ponents in the process. In total yards, the Tartans amassed 
3132 yards compared to 2355 for the opposition and also had 
the edge in scoring 220 to 203. _______________________________
Individually, the sophomore 
backfield of quarterback Rich 
Squires, halfback Terry Bell 
and fullback Tom Lombardo pro
vided most of the fireworks.
Squires completed 113 passes for 
1630 yards and 16 touchdowns.
Bell gained 644 yards on the 
ground and led all Tartan scor
ers with 66 points. Lombardo mis
sed some action because of an in
jury but still gained 531 yards, 
an improvement over his fresh
man output of 495.
Freshman Charley Price was 
the leading receiver with 34 re
ceptions good for 646 yards and 
six touchdowns. Senior co-cap
tain Tony Bugel caught four 
scoring passes and senior end 
Rudy Tepsic grabbed 10 passes 
for 210 yards.
The opposition averaged only 
2.6 yards per attempt on the 
ground against the Tartans var
iety of defensive linemen. Gary 
Meilahn Scott Calvert. John Hast
ings and Dennis Weakland were 
regulars on the defensive line 
throughout the year with Ken 
BuzZard, Art Hunkele and Bob 
Duck among others filling in on 
occasion. All will be back next 
year.
Next year's linebacker and de
fensive back situations also look 
good. Bugel played linebacker 
toward the end of the season 
and is graduating, but junior 
middle linebacker Jack Dzura 
and freshmen John Sabol and Ray 
Terza will be back. Sabol inter
cepted three passes, recovered 5 
fumbles, and hit hard all year.
Freshmen defensive backs Dick 
Miller, Chris OLeary, and Curtis 
Simmons will be back next year 
with a lot of experience. Miller 
was the teams interception lead
er with five. Simmons reported 
for practice late and didnt get 
a chance to play until Bill Halsted was injured, but Simmons 
made the njost of it and improved 
with every game. OLeary filled 
in at running back occasionally 
as well as playing in the secon
dary. The other member in the 
secondary is junior Ed Dumont 
who also led the Tartans in kickoff and punt returns..
The biggest gap left by the 
graduating seniors will be in the 
offensive line. Co-captain Denny 
Morabito, center John Slatosky 
and tackles Dick Helhowski and 
Roger Ohlson are all four year 
lettermen who added stability to 
the CMU offense. Junior Ken 
Buzzard has earned three letters 
while playing mostly offensive 
guard.
Sophomore guard Denny Dor
an missed most of the season with 
a broken foot but will be back 
next year. Paul Zugates lettered

Why does Bob Reilly feel hes putting his M.B.A. to good use at Ford Motor Company?
"Im matching wits with some 
of the best minds in the business.

"Just being associated with a 
staff that has such an outstanding 
reputation in the world of finance 
is a stimulating challenge, says 
Bob Reilly of Ford Motor Com
panys Finance Staff. Working 
here has been like getting an
other post-graduate degree. 
When Bob joined the company 
in 1964, he set a personal goal of 
making Supervisor in five years. 
He reached that goal in two-anda-half years. In less than five, he 
was named Manager of the War
ranty Analysis Department. No 
small company could have given 
me similar opportunities to grow 
and to learn, he emphasizes.
Success stories like this are not unusual at Ford Motor Com
pany. If you have a Masters De
gree in Business Administration, 
youll find opportunities to grow 
and to learn- in Financial Management, Operations Research, 
Product Planning and Marketing.
See our college recruiter when 
he visits your campus. Or contact
Mr. Richard Rosensteel, College 
Recruiting Department, Ford Mo
tor Company, American Road, 
Dearborn, Michigan 48121. An 
equal opportunity employer.
