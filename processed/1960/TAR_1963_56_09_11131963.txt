Civil Rights Legislation 
Draws Student Response
The weeks ahead are crucial times for Civil Rights Legis
lation. Strong public pressure is needed if an effective legis
lation is to be enacted in this session of the Congress. On 
Sunday, November 17, the Western Pennsylvania March on 
Washington Committee will sponsor a Write-in for Rights 
including a rally and march to theO 
downtown Post Office. This demonstration is an opportunity for 
Pittsburgh residents and students 
to dramatically express their 
convictions. It is intended that 
this demonstration will call at
tention to the need for active 
support of this cause.
The main rally will begin at 
3:30 p.m. at the Smithfield Con
gregational Church, and will in
clude speakers on the Crisis in 
Civil Rights Legislation as well 
as a Report from Birmingham, 
The committee hopes to secure the 
Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth for this 
report. Approximately 5,000 per
sons will assemble at the Smith
field Church, each carrying let
ters urging strong Civil Rights 
Legislation, to participate in the 
march from the rally to the Post 
Office. Groups are encouraged to 
carry banners and placards. Na
tional TV coverage is expected 
for both the rally and the march.
Strategy for participation of 
students is being formulated by 
groups on each campus. At Tech, 
the YMCA, YWCA and the Stu
dents for Liberal Thought and 
Action are coordinating the dis
tribution of printed fliers on Wed
nesday, November 13. Tech stu
dents wishing to participate are 
requested to meet at the parking 
lot entrance of Skibo at 1:30 on 
the 17th. From there we will 
march to the Pitt Student Union 
Ballroom for a student participa
tion. From Pitt we will go to the 
main rally downtown at 3:30.
Students are requested to write 
letters NOW to: Mike Mansfield, 
Senate Majority Leader; Everett 
Dirksen, Senate Minority Leader; 
William Moorhead, Pittsburgh 
congressman; Carl Albert, House 
Majority Leader; and Charles A. 
Halleck, House Minority Leader.
Peace Corps 
Recruits Here
Peace Corps representatives 
will visit Carnegie Tech Monday, 
November 18 through Friday, 
November Z2, speaking to organi
zations and clubs and making in
formation about the Corps avail
able to all on campus.
Two to four representatives 
will be here for consultation, and 
one of them is a volunteer re
cently returned from Peace Corps 
duty abroad. During the day their 
headquarters will be set up in the 
Administration Hall lobby; in the 
late afternoon and evening they 
will be in Skibo.
The purpose of their visit is to 
present information and recruit 
members for the Corps. Arrange
ments can be made to take Peace 
Corps examinations during the 
week. This testing, if done on 
campus, will greatly speed pro
cessing of papers of applicants.
The Peace Corps members are 
especially interested in interview
ing students who will be graduat
ed in February. But they are 
also interested in talking with any 
interested students.
The representatives hope to 
speak at as many sorority, frater
nity, and other organizations on 
campus as possible. Any group 
interested in inviting them to a 
meeting should contact Dr. Dale 
Strick, Co-ordinator of Student 
Activities, Skibo.__________________

There will be a meeting of Pi 
Delta Epsilon, Monday, November 
18, at 4:30 in Room 58, Skibo.
Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, pre
sent head of Hillel, presented the 
November 5 assembly on The 
Thought of Soren Kierkegaard to 
a capacity audience in the Wher
rett Lounge. Rabbi Rubenstein 
spoke of the assembly as a tribute 
to Kierkegaard, nineteenth cen
tury philosopher this year. This 
assembly was the opening one in 
a sereis of lectures on Kierke
gaard which are being held Wed
nesday afternoons from 4:30-5:30 
through December 11 in room 40, 
Skibo.
Soren Kierkegaard was born in 
1813 in Copenhagen and, accord
ing to Rabbi Rubenstein, is on-; 
of the greatest theologians of 
modern times whose universality 
of acceptance is on par with that 
of St. Augustine and St. Thomas 
Aquinas. Sorens opinions and 
outlook on life were largely a re
sult of events which took place 
in his fathers life.
At the age of twelve, Michael 
Kierkegaard, an extremely intelli
gent boy who had, unfortunately, 
been born into a family of very 
poor means, cursed God for hav
ing subjected him to such a miser
able life. Almost immediately 
afterwards, he was adopted by 
his wealthy uncle, to whose vast 
fortune Michael was to become 
sole heir. Although he became 
independently wealthy and able 
to retire at forty, Michael came to 
the conclusion that his earthly 
possessions were some sort of 
punishment sent from God.
The Kierkegaard family life 
was also a troubled situation. 
Michaels first wife, whom he 
loved very much, had died young 
and his second wife, Sorens 
mother, had been the object of 
much sexual scandal. All of Mich
aels children, except Soren, died 
in their twenties.
Michael Kierkegaard came % 
the conclusion that his only hope 
for eternal salvation was through 
the sacrifice of some redeemer 
and he began to think of his son,

* Tecli Student Courts Strong, 
But Activities Unpublicized
The structure of any democratic system contains three 
major divisions of operation  legislative, executive, and 
judiciary. As a principal branch of the democratic system 
behind all student activities on campus, Carnegie Tech has 
organized a strong, yet too frequently unpublicized judiciary 
court system. In this system, there are six courts which 
serve to mediate, enforce, and recommend jurisdictionary
measures in maintenance of a 
smooth-running and legally effi
cient extra-curricular program.

As the highest court, Court of

of the lower courts, whether or

The lower courts are required

I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE
In a recent learned journal (Playboy) the distinguished board 
chairman (Ralph Hot Lips Sigafoos) of one of our most 
important American industrial corporations (the Arf Mechan
ical Dog Co.) wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpointed 
our single most serious national problem: the lack of culture 
among science graduates.
Let me hasten to state that Mr. Sigufooss article was in no 
sense derogatory. He said emphatically that the science grad
uate, what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and 
chemistry, can hardly be expected to find time to study the 
arts too. What distresses Mr. Sigafoosand, indeed, all of us  
is the lopsided result of todays science courses: graduates 
who can build a skyscraper but cant compose a concerto; who 
know Newton's Third Law but not Beethovens Fourth Sym
phony: who are familiar with Fraunhofers lines but not with 
Shelleys.
Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this lamentable imbal
ance. I, however, believe there is oneand a very simple one. 
It is this: if students of science dont have time to come to 
the arts, then the arts must come to students of science.
For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry 
and music right along with physics. Students, instead of being 
called upon merely to recite, would instead be required to 
rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tuneslike, for 
instance, the stirring Colonpl Bogpy Mahr'. Thus recitations 
would not only be chock-a-block with important facts but 
would, at the same time, expose the students to the aesthetic 
delights of great poetry and music. Here, try it yourself. You 
all know 1'lip Colonpl Bogpy Mahr'. Come, sing along with me:
P'ytirt
It w'at wp lpahn in rlatt.
Einttpin
Said energy is mass.
Newton

Anm Patral't a hatral. io't Boylp.
Do you see how much more broadening, how much more up
lifting it is to learn physics tliis wav? Of course you do. What? 
You want another chorus? By all means:
Leyden
He made the Leyden jar,
T rolley
He made the Trolley car.
Cuhip
Rode in a surrey
And Diesel's a weasel. Sos Boyle.
Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March, 
he can go on to more complicated melodies like Death and Transfiguration, Sixteen Tons, and Boo-Hoo.
And when the student, loaded not only with science but 
with culture, leaves his classroom and lights his Marll>oro 
Cigarette, how much more he will enjoy that filter, that flavor, 
that pack or box! Because there will no longer be a little voic 
within him repeating that he is culturally a dolt. He will know 
know joyouslythat he is a complete man, a fulfilled man, 
and he will bask and revel in the pleasure of his Marlboro as a 
colt rolls in new grassexultant and triumphanta truly

Axelrad Attacked; 
Confusing Issues
Editor, the Tartan:
Why is it that Mr. Axelrad, 
in order to justify his position 
on an issue, be it restricted fra
ternities or civil rights, almost 
always first misrepresents the 
issue? His condemnation of the 
accommodations clause in the 
proposed civil rights legislation 
departs from this practice only 
to the extent that he makes use 
of a passage (taken from the 
New Republic, of all places) 
which also misrepresents the is
sue.
No one claims the right to 
make another person perform a 
service for him. No one wants 
to deprive individual men of 
their freedom to deal and asso
ciate with whom they please for 
whatever reasons appeal to 
them. One only asks that Ne
groes should not be deprived of 
their rights by being discrim
inated against because of color 
by those who are supposed to 
sell services to the public.

club, in regard to integration, 
should be left to them. I can 
attempt to influence them, but 
I will not use the law against 
them, or they against me, un
der the present constitution. 
However, if people enter into 
public areas of commerce, be 
it barber shops, apartment 
houses, restaurants, or what 
have you, I believe the law must 
enforce the constitutional prin
ciple of equality: equality be
fore the law and before all 
business. If you wish to sell to 
the public, then sell to all of it.
I am in favor of strong civil 
rights legislation. Where do you 
stand?

Jeffrey Axelrad
Editor, the Tartan:
Jeffrey Axelrad has done it 
again (Civil Wrongs, Nov. 6, 
1963): He has fairly clearly
stated a particular point of view 
on an issue of general concern. 
This should help people clarify 
their thinking, even when they 
disagree with him.
I would like to ask him to 
expand on his parenthetical re
marks: (if man can be said to 
have rights). Secondly, would 
he please discuss the possible 
distinction between areas of life 
which are private and those 
which are of public concern. 
Thirdly, what is the difference, 
for him, between a law which 
is passed in tne usual fashion 
and one which imposes morality 
by majority rule?
The issues involved in the 
civil rights legislation now be
ing debated in Washington de
serve much attention. It seems 
to me that what people do in

Five Hit Axelrad 
on Civil Rights
Editor, the Tartan:
In short, we agree with Mr. 
Axelrad that It is vital that 
the implications of the (civil 
rights) proposals be recognized. 
An alert citizenry is sensitive 
to the freedom and rights of 
all men (yes, this also includes 
businessmen). Yet we disagree 
with Mr. Axelrads conclusions 
and would wish him in the fu
ture to use considerable greater 
precision in his use of the term 
pubic accommodations. The 
proposed legislation does this 
(e.g. boarding houses with un
der five rooms for rent are not 
considered public, while those 
with five or over will come un
der the legislation).
We would argue that those 
institutions which ostensibly 
offer public accommodations 
should be required to do just 
that . . . serve the public, that 
is, any person who requests ac
commodations.
In reality, a man who oper
ates a place of public accom
modation is not now free to 
choose his own path in life, 
that is, to do what he pleases 
with what he owns, nor does 
government (at all levels, not 
only the Federal) wait for di
rect harm to occur before it 
limits the freedom of a man or 
woman in business. Such a per
son submits the conduct of his 
business t o governmental au
thority concerning food and drug 
provisions, sanitary laws, servA Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
The Oldest Profession
ing of liquor, etc. The govern
ment does not wait until food 
poisoning has occurred to act, 
rather it seeks preventative leg
islation which avoids the neces
sity of direct harm occurring. 
We must not blur the distinction 
between rights in the pub
lic sector of life and those in 
the private' sector. This leg
islation does not concern the 
private sector, that is, a mans 
life, private club, etc.
As to the charge that the 
morals of the majority are selfrighteously imposed upon the 
minority (from a quotation Mr. 
Axelrad uses), we can say lit
tle. Undoubtedly there are those 
who are self-righteous; many 
are not. Governments have always regulated moral behavior, 
yet its not necessarily consid
ered a tyranny for the ma
jority to prohibit murder, pros
titution, and even to concern it
self with the legal aspects of 
marriage and divorce. Even the 
first food and drug acts were 
part of a moral crusade, 
though most of us have forgot
ten that now.
Moreover, the public accom
modations section of the pro
posed legislation deals specifi
cally with those businesses in
volved in interstate commerce. 
There is an obvious problem 
connected with an interpretation 
of what businesses are included 
under interstate commerce and 
this has been made quite clear 
in the legislation itself. E.g., 
interstate commerce includes 
service stations on interstate 
highways. Should any American 
suffer the embarrassment of 
having to fill up at a colored 
pump as along interstate high
ways in South Carolina? Is 
there a difference between 
colored and regular gas and 
oil? It is this kind of unneces
sary discrimination which the 
proposed legislation seeks to 
eradicate. In effect it says no 
American should have to travel 
under such frustrating and em
barrassing conditions . . . Can 
I eat here, can I sleep there, can 
I buy gas here???
In the past it was necessary 
for other minorities (e.g. the 
Jewish community) to publish 
travel directories to alleviate the 
humiliation and uncertainty of 
travel in the Land of the Free. 
For the most part this is not 
the problem it was for these 
groups, but for Negroes in 63, 
(continued on page 5)
Recently Pittsburgh residents have witnessed raids on 
some houses of ill-repute located here. The raids were 
probably politically motivated to show how easy-going the 
in party was. Naturally the district attorney accused of per
mitting such vile goings-on denied the charge, and claimed 
that Pittsburgh was remarkably clean for a city its size. 
However both candidates for district attorney agreed, and in 
fact did not consider any other viewpointthat prostitution 
is bad and should be stopped.
Why? Does it lead girls down the wrong path? It 
would seem that they are taking the path of their own 
choosing since, at least in this section of the country, girls 
apply for the jobs. Perhaps girls could be kept from such 
work if prostitution is completely stamped-out. But why 
stop the girls from taking the jobs? If the work was morally 
repugnant to them, they would not do it. It seems as if 
people to whom prostitution is morally wrong are trying 
to enforce their value judgment by law. And if these persons 
can claim the right to pass moral judgment in one area, 
there is no reason to stop them from doing so in all areas. 
Perhaps no one should be allowed to drink alcoholic bever
ages either.
It is suggested that the brothel industry should be al
lowed to stand or fall on the services it offers, not on moral 
arguments. If Americans are morally uprightous, then the 
industry will shrivel and die  although it may be that 
some persons can not quite see how immoral it is  I am one. 
(I should add, since my parents read this and may not have 
the same standards, that the only time I have been in a 
whore-house was to talk economics with, and get informa
tion from, the owner. I just cant see paying for it. But I 
disgress.)
Perhaps legalizing prostitution would be too impractical 
a position to takethe majority would vote against persons 
taking such a stand. Instead it is suggested that votes be 
given to officials who seem most likely to enforce existing 
laws laxly. After the majority gets used to the idea, it may 
be possible to legalize such work.
What will be the effect of such changes? Probably little. 
Britain, France, and most of Europe, along with Nevada, have 
long allowed postitutes to work without undue legal harrassment, and these areas do not seem to be degenerating too 
rapidly. Also if prostitution were legalized, it could be taxed 
 which might ease the nations guilt in a manner similar 
to the way horseracing has been accepted. Or perhaps the 
majority considers gambling on horses moral.

Your Man 
In Congress
The Nov. 6 meeting began, as do all meetings, with the 
chair asking if the minutes of the previous meeting are ap
proved (a word rather popular around Tech Campus). This 
time-honored beginning of all parliamentarily organized 
meetings seems to establish continuity with the previous 
meetings of Congress, so its relative uselessness has a pur
pose; the inter-relation seems to be consciously well-pre
served in the following meeting, both in structure and content.
The first order of business is always committee heads 
reports. Publicity has decided that the spots crying out for 
self-expression (i.e. in deed of bulletin boards) are Donner 1, 
3EMG, Fine Arts and Skibo Snack Bar; Persons interested 
in applying for the job of Chairman of OW should send in the 
application by Nov. 14; And the General Campus Committee, 
which has been actively engaged in taking a Friday-AfterThanksgiving-Day-Poll, reports that interested people have 
actually tracked down members of Executive Council of CIT 
and polled them. Such valor and dedication should be reward
ed and it probably will, for FATDP reports that a majority 
of them would favor the extra day off. A Tech committee 
demonstration on Friday, when all students attending class 
(?) will wear black, has been planned. The Chairman of 
Leadership Committee, Joe Sandulli, announced plans for 
a Leadership Training Camp, still in the talking stage.
A motion by Walt Paige to the effect that after 8 p.m. 
parking lot gates should be raised for general campus use 
was passed. All the extra parking space would be valuable 
for students in need of parking places. How many other 
thoughtless regulations of the administration should be con
sidered?
A motion to permit the Pa. Society for the Mentally Re
tarded to solicit on campus was defeated. Students are as
sured in the Campus Chest drive, that at no other time will 
they be asked to give money, since most of the student body 
is far from what could be called self-supporting.
And finally, the snack bar will have canned music. No 
more the hootenannies of a Sunday Evening or the quiet 
clinking of glasses and silver, but now rock and roll, an 
inseparable companion to a juke box, blared whenever any 
misguided freshman happens to possess a dime.

Six Courts Serve the Tech Campus
(continued, from page 3)
Depending on the severity of the 
case. Student Court has the power 
to recommend a sentence of sus
pension or expulsion to the Dis
cipline Committee.
COUNCIL OF FRATERNITY 
PRESIDENTS COURT
CFP provides jurisdictional 
power over matters involving fra
ternities and individuals whose 
actions are directly responsible to 
fraternity operations.
Charges are initially presented 
to CFP Court by any fraternity 
man through his house president, 
by any house, by the president of 
the Council of Fraternity Presi
dents, by Dean Brown, Dr. Ellis, 
or Dr. Strick. Charges are dis
cussed by the Chief Justice, who 
instructs the court adjutant to 
collect statements from the accusor, the accused, and other wit
nesses who may have pertinent 
information.
Parties are later notified when 
the five justices are prepared to 
have a hearing. At the hearing, all 
witnesses may testify, after which 
the five justices decide the case in 
closed session by a majority vote.
The accused may appeal any 
decision to the Court of Appeals.
PANHELLENIC COUNCIL
The Judiciary Committee of 
Panhellenic Council consists of a 
Chief Justice, an alternate Chief 
Justice, and another member se
lected by the Executive Commit
tee of the Council following the 
annual election.
Cases brought up before this 
court are first reviewed by the 
Chief Justice, if the organization 
or individual involved in the dis
pute is not one with which she is 
affiliated. At a preliminary meet
ing, the representatives of all 
groups involved discuss the case 
in an attempt to reach an early 
decision. If no solution is recom
mended, the case is presented to 
the entire Panhellenic Council. 
The Judiciary Committee has 
final power to settle a dispute if 
Panhellenic Council fails to do so. 
They pass their recommendations 
down to the Council, and if adopt
ed, become immediately effective 
as the penalty.
Appeals of all decisions may be 
directed to the Court of Appeals.
MENS DORMITORY COUNCIL
This organization, which meets 
weekly on Tuesday, handles all 
cases involving violations of dor
mitory rules as set forth in the 
'Dormitory Regulations hand- j 
book.
Twelve dormitory presidents i

halls serve as voting members of 
the Council which exercises 
powers of a court. The president 
of Mens Dormitory Council, who 
serves as justice of the court, may 
only vote in the event of a tie.
The violator of any dorm rule 
is brought to trial after having 
been notified 48 hours prior to the 
trial. He may decide in this time 
either to prepare defense or not 
to attend the trial, in which case 
i it would be an outright admis
sion of guilt. At the trial, the ac
cused is read the charges, after

! statusesguilty as charged, guilty 
' but not as charged, or not guilty. 
All witnesses and the prosecution 
and defense are then presented.

formation of which is sent to the 
administration where further 
recommendations for action are 
made. Back in the hands of Mens 
Dormitory Council, decision is

three-quarters vote of the mem
bers. The accused is notified as 
I soon as this decision is reached.
All appeals are made through 
Court of Appeals.
WOMENS
DORMITORY COUNCIL
Womens Dormitory Council re
views all cases dealing with in
fractions of the rules in the 
Womens Residence Hall Hand

shutting out the W & J squad 
on their own course. Tech had 
a chance to prove their hill run
ning strength over the vertical 
Washington golf course. Burk
holder nailed his tenth first in 
eleven starts at 22:25. Macosko 
panted up the quarter mile 60- 
degree slope to the finish for 
second at 22:50. Niedra chugged 
in right at his heels. DAlo took 
fourth for his best finish and a 
letter for the season. Bednarz 
hung back to pull Engle ahead of 
W & Js first man who spoiled 
the shut out bid by taking 
seventh.
Burkholders time was only 40 
seconds off the course records 
set this season by the Midwests 
top small college runner Weiss of 
Thiel. Despite the scores Tech has 
posted this season, their oppo
nents have faired well against 
other schools. Westminster suf
fered their only defeats to CIT 
and Grove City, whom the Tar
tans also beat. The Titans have 
downed Case, Allegheny, Thiel, 
Betheny, Western Reserve and
Jeanette. CITs harriers seem to 
line up between the area small 
colleges and the big athletic schol
arship schools like West Virginia, 
Hiram, Penn State and Pitt. The 
Tartans closest meet this season 
was against Jeanette 24-32 where 
alumni Mike Sampbell and Ed 
Barvik were on the opposition.
But even against Pitt, Tech's 
depth might make an interesting 
contest.

The 1963 edition of Carnegie 
Tech's All-School I.M. Football 
Team, just released by the De
partment of Intramural Athletics, 
is headed by five members of the 
Grad Eagles, this years cham
pions. The Trojans, with two re
presentatives, were the only other 
team to place more than one 
member on this years mythical 
dream squad. In all, ten different 
teams were represented in the 
selection of the outstanding per
formers of the intramural foot
ball program.
The first-team offensive unit is 
captained by halfback and MVP 
Jim Grotty of the Grad Eagles. 
His running mate at the other 
half is John Borofsky, the offen? sive stalwart of TDP. Calling the 
signals for this years squad is a 
repeater from two years ago, 
quarterback Bob Murphy of the 
Grad Eagles. Leading the for
ward wall is Joe Baier, the offen
sive center of DTD. At one term
inal position is Jon Pavlik, the 
stellar pass receiver from DU, 
while the other end is John 
Regan, the leading scorer for the 
Trojans.

The defensive unit is led by 
MVP Crotty and Fred Kosofsky, 
the two hard-charging linemen of 
the Grad Eagles. The line-backers 
are Bill Oakes of the Trojans, and 
Howie Pifer of the Grad Eagles, 
a product of the PKT farm sys
tem. In the defensive secondary, 
protection is provided by PKTs 
all-around performer, Larry Lang, 
and another member of the cham
pion Grads, Joe Lees.
The second-team offensive unit 
is captained by ATO quarterback 
Steve Foels. Probably the most 
versatile performer on this years 
squad, Foels was runner-up to 
Crotty for the MVP award. At 
the two halfback positions are 
Al Brown of the Grad Eagles and 
Bill Cowherd of the Trojans, 
while the terminal positions are 
occupied by BTPs John Lindberg and Bob Livengood of the 
DORMS. At the center position is 
Bob Rubin, the offensive center of 
the Finks.
The defensive line is composed 
of Rubin and Gerry Smith, the 
hard-rusher of the Trojans. At 
the linebacker positions are 
TDPs Steve Berlin and ATOs 
defensive captain Jerry Unger. At 
one safety position is Don Shockey 
of the Grad Eagles B, while 
the unit is rounded out by Ron 
Pastorek, the defensive signalcaller of the Trojans.
