Campus Reaction to Death of JFK: Shock, 
Disbelief; Waiting Period Adds Fear, Hope
By Chris Macoskoby Dale Chodorow
Two-Four-Six-Eight! We all 
want to demonstrate!
Friday No! Friday No!
Lets eat turkey at home in 
64!
These were some of the sounds 
that rang out in the hallowed halls 
0>f Carnegie last Thursday. Posters 
pwere circulated bearing a turkey 
[ impaled on an arrow (not 
Cupids).
This noise was squelched by an

I Congress veto and perhaps more 
j effectively* by the solemn shrouds 
I that have draped the nation this 
I week. No one felt the student-ad| ministration hassle was serious 
enough to interrupt mourning 
Lover the Chief Executive, 
p Last Wednesday Congress 
President, Tom Pyke, read a let
ter from Dean Brown reporting 
that the administration would 
base next years vacation on stu
dent cooperation in attending this

I Tech Committee had anticipated 
I this move and its chairman, Roger

I call an all-school demonstration

Administration with a petition. 
I After heated debate, the motion 
I carried by a small plurality.
However, the following day the

Vart Helps Negro Students
Campus Chest, Techs only campus-wide charity appeal, 
will launch its drive on December 4 and end it on December 
8. In these four short days Campus Chest will aim for sup
port from every single person at C I T. Since the funds from 
the drive are going to aid to needy students, we are appealing 
directly to students to help others*' 
like themselves. Contributions
fcvill be allocated to international 
[(World University Service), na- I tional, and local student services.
As World University Service,

I look at out student aid on the naI tional level, The National ScholI arship Service and Fund for NeI gro Students. This scholarship 
^service (NSSFNS) is an indeMbendent agency, established to inI crease higher educational oppor| tunities for qualified Negro stuI dents in interracial colleges in

NSSFNS helps many high school 
I students who are college candi dates by giving advisory services,

CFP, Pan-Hel 
Unite Activity
Techs Council of Fraternity 
Presidents has proclaimed De
cember 2-7 as Greek Week, 
1963.* Concieved as a means to 
unite the entire fraternity sys
tem at Carnegie Tech, the Week 
will feature a Pan-Hel-CFP for
um, officer workshops, and a 
weekend of festivity.
The week will be opened Mon
day, December 2, with a joint 
meeting of CFP and Pan Hellenic 
Council, devoted to a consideration 
of methods of greater fraternitysorority cooperation. Throughout 
the week, there will be several 
officer and committee chairman 
meetings held in the fraternity of 
the discussion leaders in which 
problems unique to one position 
will be discussed in a roundtable 
format. Such meetings are slated 
for treasurers, house chairmen, 
stewards, social chairmen, rush 
chairmen, scholarship chairmen, 
alumi chairmen, and pledge train
ers.
Seriousness will not character
ize the entire week, however, as

Last Friday had begun as any normal day. The weather 
was seasonably pleasant and the air was clear. The morning 
gave no foreboding sign that by 3:00 in the afternoon, the 
course of history would be so determinably altered.
I had one class that morning, after which I spent some
?time in the library finishing what
Tech Observes 
Mourning Day 
For Kennedy
Last Fridays reaction to the 
assasination of President Kennedy 
was sorrowfully felt in all areas 
of the campus.
Dr. John Warner, President of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
called an immediate session of the 
Executive Board and proclaimed 
Monday as a day of mourning for 
Carnegie Tech.
A memorial service, upon his 
recommendation, was held at 
10:00 a.m. in Skibo Ballroom on 
the morning of the late Presi
dents funeral. All classes were 
suspended that day.
In a telegram to Mrs. Kennedy 
in Washington, Tom Pyke, Chair
man of Student Congress, ex
pressed, on behalf of the student 
body of Carnegie Tech, our sor
row at the untimely death of 
your husband, our President, re
garded most highly by the nation 
and the entire world.

little written homework I had. The 
library was the scene of usual 
campus activity, and the students 
were as earnest in their endeav
ors that day, as any other. Their 
anticipation of the Thanksgiving 
vacation only five days away was 
motivation enough for a diligent 
spurt of studying, which I sensed.
At lunch the students were jo
vial. The noon edition of the 
Pittsburgh Press had nothing of 
unusual significance to report. Af
ter lunch I went up to the Wher
rett Room to watch some skiing 
movies and inquire about the Ski 
Club. About twenty people were 
there with me and their interest 
in the movies was clearly evident.
Returning to Fine Arts build
ing I noticed the herd of secre
taries on their way to Skibo to 
relax on their lunch hour. The 
long lines of students were also 
on their way there and I enjoyed 
seeing it as much on Friday as 
I did on any other day.
The afternoon was not signifi
cant in its commencement. I chat
ted with some students between 
12:30 and 1:45 and drafted por
tions of a design which I was 
slated to present the following: 
Monday. At 1:45 I decided to go 
to the Cashiers Office and cash 
a check. It was here that events 
began to unfurl.
Bulletin Aired at 1:35 SST
At about 1:35, a bulletin had 
been relayed over the radio that 
in the course of President Ken
nedys tour through Texas, a snip
er had shot both the President 
and the Governor of that state.
The initial news, trickling in, 
was scoffed. Word of mouth news
casts were laughed at and ques
tioned as ridiculous. I was in the 
Cashiers Office when I first 
learned, and it wasnt by word 
of mouth. Before a group of about 
12 students there, the radio had 
presented us with the news. I 
had no time to wonder. I only 
asked myself how serious it all 
could be?
On my return to Fine Arts, I 
heard a very callous remark from 
one student  . occupational
hazard. My stomach sank. I felt 
a horrible chill overcome me. It 
was an inexplicable combination 
of fear, hope, and helplessness. I 
waited.
Groups of students sifted 
around transistors and by 2:00 it 
was a fact that the Thirty-Fifth 
President of the United States 
had been seriously wounded in an 
assasination attempt.
The campus was shocked. We 
frantically searched for areas 
where confirmation of the seem
ingly unreal tragedy could be se
cured.
Back in Fine Arts, I approached 
a politically-interested and hu
manly compassionate classmate of 
mine, (probably out of comfort) 
and asked if he had heard of the 
news. I hadnt the nerve or the 
composure to plainly announce 
what I had heard, perhaps be
cause I still had not brought my- (continued on page 5)

to his immortal Warsaw Concerto. Chopin said he needed 
Georges Sands help desperately because he could not find a 
rhyme for Warsaw. Naturally, Georges could not refuse 
such an urgent request.
(Well sir, off to Majorca went Georges, but before she left, 
she told her little daughter Walter that some bad men were 
coming to murder Daddy in his bath. She instructed Walter 
to shout Robespierres name the moment the bad men arrived. 
But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning on the 
Riviera, and she had come home with a big bag of salt water 
taffy, and when the bad men arrived to murder Robespierre, 
Walter, alas, was chewing a wad of taffy and could not get her 
mouth unstuck in time to shout a warning. Robespierre, alas, 
was murdered quicker than you could say Jacques Robespierre 
or Jack Robinson, as he is called in English-speaking countries.
(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer 
in this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca, she did 
succeed in helping Chopin find a rhyme for Warsaw as every
one knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:
In the fair Unon of Warsaw,
Which Napoleon horse saw,
Singing cockles and mussels, alive, alive of)

We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all try to 
find at Christmas is, of course, unusual and distinctive gifts for 
our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes?
What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros 
as unusual? You had regarded them as familiar, reliable smokes 
whose excellence varied not one jot nor tittle from year to year?
True. All true. But all the same, Marlboros are unusual be
cause every time you try one, its like the first time. The flavor 
never palls, the filter never gets hackneyed, the soft pack is 
ever a new delight, and so is the Flip Top box. Each Marlboro 
is a fresh and pristine pleasure, and if you want all your friends 
to clap their hands and cry, Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa 
Claus! you will see that their stockings are filled with Marl
boros on Christmas morn.  ic3 Max shuim*

ever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states of the Union. You 
get a lot to like in Marlboro Country.
Omicron Delta Kappa, the hon
orary organization of Carnegie 
Tech and a chapter of the same 
national organization, represents 
those seniors who have shown, on 
the basis of their first three years, 
outstanding accomplishments in 
both the academic and extra
curricular areas of college ac
tivity.
ODK plays a major role in the 
encouragement of freshman par
ticipation in the activities pro
gram of Carnegie Tech. It co
sponsors a convocation to recog
nize students who excel in campus 
activities and who contribute to 
the advancement of the college 
community.
The purposes are concise  
recognition of leadership and 
j the encouragement of enthusiastic 
student participation  but the 
accomplishments manifested by 
the current 10 student and 2 fac
ulty members of ODK are both 
varied and distinguished.
Steve Nygren (the first arbi
trary selection of the 12 members 
to be presented) is, academically, 
top student in the Department of 
Engineering and Science (nothing 
arbitrary about that). A senior 
 in Electrical Engineering and one 
of the four most recent who were 
inducted to ODK, Steve is pres
ently receiving a Westinghouse 
Scholarship. He serves this year 
as President of Eta Kappa Nu, 
Vice-President of Tau Beta Pi, 
and President of Cameron Choir.
His membership in Phi Kappa 
Phi is another of his distinctions.
As Chief Justice of both Court 
of Appeals and Student Court, 
Bob Mercer, a senior physics ma
jor, is studying this year on a 
Pittsburgh Foundry mens Associa
tion Scholarship. Besides his ac
tive participation in IM football, 
volleyball, waterpolo, and soft
ball, Bob, who is also Chaplain 
of Alpha Tau Omega, is on the 
Intramural Board and serves as 
President of the Officials Club.
Henry Gailliot, on a Gilmore 
and Charlotte Tilbrook Scholar
ship, is Chief Justice of CFP 
Court and past President of Phi 
Kappa Theta. A senior in Indus
trial Management, he is VicePresident of Delta Skull, and 
holds membership in the honorary 
organization of Phi Kappa Phi, 
Tau Beta Pi, and Scimitars. Of 
pertinent importance is Henrys 
position as President of Omicron 
Delta Kappa.
Chairman of Student Congress 
and on a Westinghouse Scholar
ship, Tom Pyke has shown him
self to be an active participant in 
Freshman Camp (Program Chair
man), Student Christian Federa
tion (Treasurer), Delta Skull 
(Secretary-Treasurer), Pi Kappa 
Alpha (Vice-President), Eta Kap
pa Nu, the Institute of Electrical 
Engineers, and Varsity Athletic 
Board. Tom, an Electrical En
gineering senior, is also Secre
tary of Omicron Delta Kappa.

Dave Vandelinde, also a senior 
in EE, serves as President of 
CFP. He is Vice-President of Eta 
Kappa Nu, and a member of Tau 
Beta Pi, Pi Delta Epsilon, I.E.E.E., 
and Sigma Nu. Recently inducted 
to ODK, Dave is studying on a 
Hertz Engineering Foundation 
Scholarship.
Former President of Theta Xi, 
Miron Straf, a senior in Mathe
matics, is Editor-in-Chief of this 
years Tartan. He is a member of 
Pi Delta Epsilon and the School 
Athletic Board. His position on 
the newspaper is a culmination of 
three years work as National Ad
vertising Manager and Business 
Manager.
The two sub-senior (fourth 
year) architects in ODK, Bill 
Small (another recent inductee) 
and Jack Scholl, represent the po
sitions of Editor-in-Chief of the 
Technical and Chairman of the 
Architecturel Student Council, re
spectively. Bill is also on the 
Quality Control Board of Pi Delta 
Epsilon, House Manager of Beta 
Theta Pi, and has served on Stu
dent Congress for two years.
Jack has the unusual distinc
tion of serving as vice-president 
in three organizations  CFP,

of this interesting phrase Quicker than you can say Jack

Editorial
An Informed Student Body
The recent decision of Executive Board on 
Thanksgiving vacation again brings to mind 
the gap of information that exists between 
the administration and the students. It is 
not clear whether our administration con
siders student opinion. Many complaints go 
unanswered. Perhaps the administration has 
considered them, but their reasons are rarely 
heard.
Student Congress should initiate a forum 
or assembly where members of the adminis
tration could establish a rapport with the 
students. For example, Mr. Strathmeyer, 
Vice-President of Business Affairs, could ex
plain the reasons behind the creation of the 
current parking situation and open himself 
to questions from the students. We offer Mr. 
Strathmeyer as an example, because he has 
of his own accord placed himself in a similar
position before fraternity presidents to an
swer their questions on financing problems. 
The purpose of this forum would not be to 
put administrators on the spot, nor to por
tray them as ogers and have the students 
flay them with loaded questions. It would 
encourage instead a closer student-faculty 
relationship, and bring to the students at
tention the problems, decisions, and the fu
ture plans of their alma mater.
Even the most active man of this Uni
versity, Dr. Warner, took time to speak to 
the students at a Congress meeting last year 
and explained to them the future plans of 
Carnegie Tech in the next ten years. We 
hope that the faculty and students are recep
tive to this proposal.
M.L.S.
The Endless Chain
Circulating around the Carnegie Tech 
campus is a peculiar chain letter. The let
ter is sold attached to a savings bond which 
the purchaser must mail to the name on the 
bond. A student will buy the letter hoping 
to receive 30 or more savings bonds when 
the chain is completed. That intelligent stu
dents could conceive of purchasing a worth
less bond and a list of people to send money 
to is implausible.
Chain letters, like all get - rich - quick 
schemes, are fascinating. People merely rely 
on their trust in human nature and hasten
wNSRNOG rOyCN
to not break the chain rather than take the 
time to think of what the consequences will 
probably be. They are captivated by the 
fancy wording and promises of the letter 
and lured by those who claim to have struck 
upon a windfall.
Students realize that many lose on a 
chain letter, but there is always an excep
tion. And it is so more pleasant for them 
to enjoy temptation, trusting the exception, 
rather than fearing homilies based on the 
odds.M. L. S.

Why
Editor, the Tartan:
I am in complete agreement 
with the Student Congress rec
ommendation for a change in the 
newly revised school calendar 
calling for Friday classes follow
ing Thanksgiving. Whether the 
Executive Board considers this 
proposal favorably or not, I think 
the student body is entitled to 
know the reasoning behind a de
cision which so obviously was to 
be received unfavorably by the 
students. Will someone please ex
plain the Boards justification for 
the calendar change?

Editor, the Tartan:
I was pleased, and I must 
admit, disturbed upon reading 
this past weeks New York 
Times. Pleased, naturally, to see 
your letter in the article on stu
dent attitude, but certainly dis
tressed to learn that the editor 
of the Tartan considers Tech an 
engineering - school.
The Presidents of CIT have 
certainly never believed this, 
anyone who has worked with a 
Tech Industrial Management 
Grad would not believe it, nor 
anyone who reads a Broadway 
Playbill or visits any number of 
Art Galleries across the land.
One simple testament of the 
fact that Tech is not only an 
engineering school but -an in
stitute with many areas of study 
is the large picture at the top of 
the first page of the Arts Section 
of the same New York Times. At 
least two of Techs best known
The president of the United States is certainly one of 
the most important men on earth. The process of his selec
tion is one in which more persons participate than that of 
any other person of similar power. While many persons may 
disagree with the person chosen by a democratic process, 
by their participation in the process they agree to abide by 
the results. When steps are taken to change these results 
by force, then a rejection of the democratic process is im
plied. When force is used to accomplish a political end, 
then much of the heritage of man has been disregarded.
At the time the continuity of government is correctly 
being emphasized. One of the best point of government in 
the U.S. is the manner in which power is transferred  that 
is, with the aid of persons of all political hues. President 
Kennedys loss will change much in the long run, but the 
running of the Federal Government is not a personal process 
here  as it is in France for instance. This nation can be 
thankful that provision has been made for emergencies 
such as this one.
The columns in this space have often been critical of 
President Kennedys views. But the president was still en
titled to his opinions even if they often were not accepted. 
Mr. Kennedy was the man chosen to lead the country; his 
death is as tragic as any other death under similar circum
stances. This article will not attempt to say again what has, 
by the time this has been printed, been said many times. In 
this instance, the author agrees with the majoritys opinion 
of the event.

*Tech Receives Grant 
For Teaching Program
Tech has been given a grant of have been enrolled in AP courses;
Tech Mourns Presidents Death; 
Disbelief Turns To Shock, Tears
$228,350 by the Ford Foundations 
Fund for the Advancement of 
Education, to be used to set up a 
program in English, history, and 
*the natural sciences leading to a 
Master of Arts degree for sec
ondary school teachers. With this 
grant, Tech has now received over 
$1 million in grants for programs 
in curriculum development and 
teacher education, and has become 
a national leader in these fields.
The new MA program, which is 
a cooperative project between 
Tech and neighboring secondary 
schools, will provide the follow-r
jng: (1) A five-year curriculum 
at Carnegie Tech for teachers who 
will, upon ' completing it, have 
earned a BA, state certification, 
and a subject-matter MA; (2) A 
subject-matter MA for experienc
ed teachers, whether graduates of 
Carnegie Tech or elsewhere; (3) A 
means for making available to in
terested public schools the new 
curricula being developed at Car
negie Tech and at other schools;r
(4) A means for strengthening 
in-service training programs in 
the public schools; (5) A means 
for continuing and expanding the 
cooperation between Carnegie 
Tech and the secondary schools 
of the area; (6) A demonstration 
of a new program that could be 
adapted to meet the special needs 
of colleges and universities any
where in the country  a pro
gram that meets the growing de
mands of public school systems 
fend state departments of educa
tion for a subject-matter MA for 
permanent teacher certification.
Dr. John H. Sandberg, recently 
appointed as assistant professor of 
psychology and Director of Teach
er Education at Carnegie Tech, is 
chairman of a committee which 
will administer the new program. 
Other members of the committee 
are (from Carnegie Tech) Profes
sors John R. Coleman, dean of 
Ithe Division of Humanities and 
Social Sciences; Edwin Fenton, di
rector of the Curriculum Develop
ment Center, Project Social Stu
dies; Robert C. Slack, director of 
the Curriculum Development Cen
ter, Project English; and Erwin 
R. Steinberg, dean of Margaret 
Morrison College; together with 
Warren D. Shepler, assistant sup-k
_ erintendent, Baldwin - Whitehall
Public Schools, and Robert I. 
Bperber, assistant superintendent 
_ of Pittsburgh Public Schools.
The new MA program grew out 
of four other projects which Car
negie Tech is now operating. 
These projects, all aimed at the 
development of curricula for able 
secondary school students, are:
(1) Advanced Placement Program 
in English and history.
(2) Project English.
(3) Project Social Studies.
4) Biology-Chemistry-Mathematics Project.
Advanced Placement Program. 
Total grants: $191,000. Carnegie 
Techs English and history depart
ments worked with 34 public and 
private high schools in the Pitts
burgh area to develop collegelevel courses and new methods of 
teaching exceptional high school 
students. The program is now in 
its fourth year. More than 150 
ieachers have attended one-month 
coperative summer institutes at 
Carnegie Tech; over 1200 students
3000 copies of syllabi for AP 
courses have been requested by 
teachers all over the country.
Project English. Total grant: 
$220,000. The project is in its sec
ond year. The goal is to develop j 
sequential and cumulative courses 
in reading, language, and composition for grades ten through 12.J 
Thus far 20 high school teachers 
from five cooperating schools have 
worked with the Carnegie Tech j 
staff to develop in detail the entire 
three-year sequence. Seven classes  
of tenth-grade students have used 
the new course. A careful system i 
of evaluation involving control 
groups has been set up.
Dean Erwin R. Steinberg has 
been appointed a consultant to the 
U.S. Office of Education to serve 
as national coordinator of Project 
English. He has also been appoint
ed chairman of the Committee of 
Examiners for the General Exam
ination in English Composition, by 
the Educational Testing Service, 
Princeton, New Jersey.
Project Social Studies: Total
grant: $250,000. This project,
which is in its first year, is similar 
in operation to Project English. It 
| involves the writing of a sequen
tial and cumulative curriculum in 
history and the social sciences for 
grades nine through 12. Last 
month seven ninth-grade classes 
began to use new material writ
ten this past summer by five 
Pittsburgh high school teachers 
and ten university professors.
Biology-Chemistry-Mathematics 
Project. Total grant: $110,000. This 
project is also in its first year. It 
will result eventually in the de
velopment of a sequential and 
cumulative series of courses in 
mathematics and the sciences for 
able students in grades seven 
through 12. This summer 30 high 
school teachers studied the first of 
these new courses at Carnegie 
Tech and the courses were install
ed in Pittsburgh high schools last 
month.
Music Head, - 
Sidney Hearth, 
Goes To NASM
Sidney Harth, head of Techs 
Music Department, will attend 
the National Association of 
Music annual meeting in Chicago 
on November 29 and 30.
Some 280 schools will be rep
resented by the Deans of the mu
sic departments in most of our 
universities and colleges and by 
the administrative heads of con
servatories.
The NASM has been designated 
by the National Commission on 
Accrediting as the responsible 
agency for the accreditation of 
all music degree curricula. Its 
deliberations will play an im
portant part in music education 
trends in this country during the 
coming years.
The underlying theme of the 
meeting might well be entitled 
The Inner Loo, and much time 
will be spent in evaluating the 
problems and the future goals 
which face the NASM and music 
education in this country.

self to the acceptance of what I 
had learned.
His exclamation of surprise was 
enough to draw other students 
around us, and as the questions 
were asked, I felt compelled to 
answer from the meager and ut
terly fantastic knowledge that I 
had acquired of the incident.
The area became a center of 
confusion and dismay. The time 
was about 2:45 and everyone fran
tically searched for a radio. There 
was a very sensible reservation 
of conjectures by Uie students. We 
al stood in shocked silence. One 
student, with a small transistor 
radio, glued to his ear, gave the 
crowd of about fifty students the 
gruesome details.
At this time, although the news 
of the attempted assasination was 
a fact, no one knew of the Presi
dents condition.
My first thought then was to 
seek a source of first-hand ac
curate information. Having 
worked on WRCT, I knew of 
their possession of a United Press 
International teletype machine. By 
2:50, I was there, and with tears 
in my eyes, I read the awful de
tails of the tragedy.
Crowd at WRCT
The milling crowd at the sta- j 
tion was fixed to that machine, j 
Their attention was unanimous, 
having been dictated by the ef
fect in Dallas, Texas, of a fana
tics blind devotion to snuff out 
the life of a man, whose exis-1 
tence dictated our own welfare.
It so deeply affected us, not 
because John Fitzgerald Kennedy 
was the President of the United 
States, but because John Fitz
gerald Kennedy was a humani
tarian. His spirit and devotion to 
the cause of mankind was only 
limited by his representation of 
the government of the United 
States. His gift in life was an in
finite perception of life  his 
recognition that there is as much 
to be learned from what is at 
ones feet as that which is above 
ones head. The American people 
saw JFK as a President, a hu
man being, and an inspiration. 
The seconds ticked away in the 
radio station and the fear of the
.NTU laS6 SC USal 2SGC7

loss of this great man grew stead
ily stronger with each sound of 
the clock.
The questions were all the same 
now.
Whats happening?
Did they get the guy?
Is he dead?
Lull Gives Time For Thought
WRCT had been monitoring the 
news broadcasts over the CBS 
network, and the teletype had 
been serving as confirmation and 
elaboration of those details by 
CBS. At about 2:55 there was a 
lull in both of the broadcasting 
media. It gave us a chance to 
think about the future, catch up 
on the details we missed, or to 
strengthen our hopes that it 
wasnt as serious as we feared.
The only sounds now were the 
incessant clicking of the teletype, 
and the soft whispers of the 
crowd in the station. The next 
few moments brought the final 
word.
President Kennedy was dead. 
The announcement was aired over
CBS at about 3:00 p.m.
I hadnt been in the station 
when the announcement was 
made. I had been in the hall, 
pacing, sipping water at the 
drinking fountain, only in an at
tempt to relieve the twisted 
nervousness that had begun to sap 
my strength. My only comfort in 
hearing the words, Hes dead," 
was in the assuage of that be
wildered tension which had 
clutched me not one hour before.
The teletype room was still 
packed with those who wouldnt 
allow themselves to believe what 
they had heard on the radio. They 
wanted to see it in print. I had 
that same desire, but the tears 
that fogged my vision and my 
thoughts, were enough to tell me 
that the end has come and gone.
Upon leaving the radio station, 
I was confronted by a student, 
who said, I never liked the guy, 
but
Interrupting him, with indig
nant sorrow, I said, Youre going 
to miss him now.

He has it at Western Electric
John LaCost received his B.S.E.E. from the Uni
versity of Illinois in 1962. One of the factors which 
influenced him to join Western Electric was the 
quick manner in which new engineers become 
operational.
During the short time John has been with us, he 
has worked in several areas which are vital to the 
nations communications complex. And with his 
future development in mind, John attended one of 
our Graduate Engineer Training Centers where he 
studied the front-line Electronic Switching System. 
He is currently working as a systems equipment 
engineer on such projects as cross bar switching 
and line link pulsing.
Johns future at Western Electric looks promis
ing indeed. He knows he will be working with revo
lutionary and advanced engineering concepts like 
electronic switching, thin film circuitry, computercontrolled production lines and microwave sys
tems. He is also aware of the continued opportunity 
for advanced study through the Company-paid 
Tuition Refund Plan, as well as through Company 
training centers.
How do you see your future? If you have high 
personal standards and the qualifications we are 
looking for, we should talk. Opportunities for fastmoving careers exist now, not only for electrical, 
mechanical and industrial engineers, but also for 
physical science, liberal arts and business majors.

One lecture in this series, 
which will be gi^en on campus,

will be concerned with Julius 
Caesar, the play to be presented 
by the drama department as this

has effected has been in drawing 
large segments of public attention 
to the educational problems of the

Tech Alumna Serving 
In Peace Corps
Gibbs Offers
Two $1,485
Scholarships
John LaCost wanted a
Miss Toni Powell, a 1961 Car
negie Institute o f Technology 
graduate gave up marriage to be
come a Peace Corps Volunteer in 
Nigeria. Miss Powell is teaching 
English, history, literature and 
music at Baptist Girls High 
School, located a mile from the 
heart of downtown Oshogbo.
Oshogbo is a bustling little 
Western Nigerian town straddl
ing a narrow ribbon-like high
way for more than a thousand 
yards. Its thickly set business 
area  shops and hundreds of 
street vendors rattling a banter 
of Yoruba (tribal language)  
gives a thrilling panorama of Af
rican life on the move.
The six year-old school has an 
enrollment of 160 girls. Its cam
pus is composed of two class
room buildings, four dormitories, 
a library, a chapel-dining room, 
ironing sheds and faculty cot
tages.
Miss Powell says her greatest 
difficulty is teaching musical tech
niques without a piano. However, 
she is able to teach songs. She 
gives the songs in English, the 
students transpose them into 
Yoruba, then sing them back in 
the tribal tongue.
Althor|;h she studied Yoruba 
in Peace Corps training at New 
Yorks Columbia University, she 
feels her fluency is still inade
quate. My conversation in Yo
ruba is not good, she said. How
ever, it doesnt hamper my com
munication with students, because 
we are to teach as much English 
as possible. Occasionally, its sort 
of rough on my social communi
cations, she added.
Originally, the young Peace 
Corps Volunteer had no inten
tions of joining up, marriage 
was foremost in her mind. In the 
summer of 1962, she went to work 
as a copy-writer with the Uni
versity of Pittsburghs Liberian 
Training Program, and I guess 
it just got into my blood, she 
said. When asked about the wed
ding, she answered in typical 
African style, Its finished.
Generally, she says, I like 
it very much, here. I am really 
happy. If I have any complaint, 
its because I am not teaching in 
the upper forms. (Forms are 
equivalent to U.S. senior high 
classes.) But this is not a ma
jor thing.
Although she loves Nigerian 
food, she says, It has too much 
pepper. It burns me up. Miss 
Powell and her housemate Peace 
Corps Volunteer Miss Mildred
.eEy hebNaa
Gault, of Conway, Arkansas, do 
most of their own cooking using 
American foods.
The English major graduate 
was copywriting releases for a 
Chicago public relations firm 
when she traded jobs that led 
to her Peace Corps experience.
With little more than a year 
to go on her present assignment, 
future plans are far-fetched. She 
feels she may enter graduate 
school or work for the Peace 
Corps.
My father was a little upset 
when I first mentioned Peace 
Corps, but I think hes proud 
of me now, she declared. It 
was the distance and the thought 
of two years that concerned him. 
But I think my happiness here 
has satisfied him.
In addition to Miss Powell, 
there are four other CIT gradu
ates who now serve in the Peace 
Corps. They are: Charles E. 
Cathey, BS Chemical Engineering, 
serving in Tanganyika; Carl D. 
Delianton, BS Chemical Engi
neering, serving in Somalia; Al
bert L. Horley, BS Physics, serv
ing in Malaya; and Anne M. 
Richter, BFA Painting, serving in 
Nyasaland.
Two national scholarships for 
college senior girls are offered 
for 1964-1965 by the Katherine 
Gibbs School. These awards were 
established in 1935 as a memor
ial to Mrs. Katherine M. Gibbs, 
founder and first president of the 
School.
Each scholarship consists of full 
tution ($985) for the secretarial 
training course, plus an additional 
cash award of $500, totaling 
$1,485. The winners may select 
any one of the four Gibbs schools 
for their training Boston, New 
York, Montclair, or Providence.
Winners are chosen by the 
Scholarship Committee on the 
basis of college academic record, 
personal and character qualifica
tions, financial need, and poten
tialities for success in business.
Each college or university may 
recommend two candidates and 
each candidate must have this 
official endorsement. Students 
who may be interested in com
peting for one of these Katherine 
Gibbs awards may obtain full in
formation from the college place
ment bureau.

John Gensel9 
Jazz Pastor 
Plays Concert
The First Lutheran Church, 
Grant Street, downtown, was 
fcthe scene of a jazz concert on 
Thursday, November 21, at 8 
oclock. Rev. Harold R. Albert, 
D.D., pastor of the First Lutheran 
Church, invited John C. Gensel, 
P. D., the Nationally known 
?jazz pastor and his trio to ren
der A Musical Offering to God. 
The technique was setting litur
gical materials to jazz which 
brought Rev. Gensel national 
recognition and fame.
The Rev. Mr. Gensel is pastor 
of the Advent Lutheran Church 
in New York, and ministers to 
jazz musicians as part of the 
ministry of his congregation. He 
has appeared on numerous tele
vision shows including the To
-night show on which he apP peared with Duke Ellington. 
More recently, he was heard with 
Father Norman OConnor In Two 
Worlds of Jazz on KDKA.
A Musical Offering to God 
was the product of nearly a year 
of collaboration of Thomas 
Vaughn and Charles Smith who 
composed and arranged the score. 
A professional jazz pianist and 
composer, Mr. Vaughn is a gradi^uate divinity student at Yale, 
working toward his ordination in 
the Episcopal faith. Mr. Smith, 
who attended Columbia Univer
sity and the Manhattan School of 
Music, is a jazz composer and 
percussionist whose work has 
been featured by Duke Elling
ton, the Benny Goodman Sextet, 
the George Shearing Quintet and 
numerous other jazz groups.
^ The jazz trio who appeared 
 with Rev. Gensel are well known 
Thomas Vaughn, pianist, Charles 
Smith, percussionist, and Joe 
Bianco, bass violist.
The trio appeared at the 
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary 
on Thursday morning, November

CFP, Pan-Hel 
Plan Week
[continued from page 1]
^ climax of entertainment and so
cial events to make the week a 
memorable one. The CFP Formal 
and Pan-Hel Formal, formerly 
separate events held later in the 
year have now been combined in
to one CFP-Pan-Hel Formal to 
be held Friday, December 6 in 
the Skibo Ballroom. Music will be 
provided by the Alex Powell Or
chestra, well known group in 
country-clubs and local affairs, 
as well as in Dixieland buffs. 
Saturdays schedule of fun will 
begin in the afternoon with en
tertainment provided by Walt 
Harper, a popular band leader 
throughout the Western Penn
sylvania area. At breaks in the 
session, the Cannonball Trio, a 
Pittsburgh folksinging group will 
entertain.
Saturday evening the entire 
system will join in open house 
V parties to be held in the houses of 
Phi Kappa Theta, Tau Delta Phi, 
Dellta Tau Delta, and Pi Kappa 
Alpha. Combos supplied by CFP 
will add to the success of the 
evening.

In the evening of September 11, 
1865, Alpha Tau Omega Frater
nity was created by thre students 
of the Virginia Military Institute. 
In 1869, Sigma Nu had its found
ing on the same campus. Through
out the years, the brothers of the 
two houses on the Tech campus 
have continued the southern tra
ditions of the small military 
school through an annual formal 
appropriately titled VMI.
This year the respective pledge 
masters of the two houses, Andy 
Logan of Sigma Nu, and Bill Von 
Twistern of ATO, opened the way 
for competition between the two 
pledge classes in the form of a 
contest to see which house could 
obtain more of the others 
trophies. On Sunday, November 
11, the white flag was lowered 
and the contest was on. The 
initial raids were mere skirmishes 
j and a truce was temporarily arj ranged Tuesday so that the fresh
men could turn their attention to 
the upcoming Chemistry exam.
All was quiet through Wednes
day, and that evening the respec
tive pledge classes were invited to 
dinner by the actives of the two 
houses. In effect, this gave each
pledge class an opportunity to 
scout their opponents territory. 
ATO pledges Mickey Graziano 
and Geoffrey Sigworth returned 
with an idea in their minds, and 
at 6:40 on Thursday morning they 
entered the Sigma Nu house via 
the fire escape, silenced the guard, 
and left with the large fraternity 
emblem which hung on the sec
ond floor. Then at 9:40 the ATOs 
launched the most successful at
tack of the campaign as they 
stormed the Sigma Nu house and 
found that pledge G. R. Webster 
was the only sentry on duty. 
Within minutes a mixture of ATO 
pledges and Sigma Nu trophies 
could be seen emerging from the 
interior of 1055 More wood Ave
nue.
This successful maneuver 
brought about a series of small 
raids on the ATO house that eve
ning, but the Tau pledges, under 
the direction of General Magoo 
prevented any advancement.
Word leaked out that Sigma 
Nus next objective would be ATO 
president Joe Hartman. As a re
sult Joe was kept inside all day 
and emerged only at 2:00 a.m. for 
a quick trip to Oakland Original. 
The strategy used in planning 
this trip would have made Frank 
Nitty seem like an amateur. Joe 
was placed in the front seat of an 
armored v Chevrolet driven by 
Allen Green, and was protected 
on the other side by active Paul 
Magnuson. In the back seat 
pledges Dick Talia, Dave Ileson, 
and Bob Hoy held n-factorial 
water balloons in anticipation. 
Just as their order was ready, the 
scent of Sigma Nu pledges filled 
the air, and as a precaution, Joe 
made the return trip in a shop
ping bag sandwiched between six 
hoagies and twelve pieces of pepperoni.
Thursday afternoon the Sigma 
Nu pledges scored their most 
stunning victory as they captured 
ATOs prized mascot Suds from 
the front lawn. An ATO attempt 
to capture SN president Rich 
Ferguson in EH Friday morning 
was nearly successful. He was 
placed in the elevator for a quick 
trip to a waiting car at D-level, 
but a pair of unsuspecting grad 
students put a key in the lock and 
prevented the door from closing. 
Needless to say, the area was soon 
swarming with Sigma Nus.
The competition was slated to 
end at 6:00 p.m. that evening and 
the ATOs sat down to dinner
with the situation seemingly well 
in hand. At 5:50, three Sigma Nu 
pledges entered via the front door 
but were quickly repulsed. Then 
at 5:55 the entire Sigma Nu pledge 
class stormed the back door of 
the ATO house, and the final 
minutes-of the contest proved to 
be the most exciting.
After dinner Suds was re
turned to 1091 Morewood Ave., 
and all that remained was the 
returning of the trophies that 
night at the formal. The week was 
an exciting one for both houses, 
and succeeded in promoting 
stronger friendships among the 
respective members of Sigma Nu 
and Alpha Tau Omega. All who 
attended the formal at the 
Churchill Valley Country Club 
agreed it was an excellent closing 
to the tradition established at a 
small military school in Lexing
ton, Virginia almost a century 
ago.
Appointment of three promin- ] 
ent architects as the jury for the I 
1964 fourth annual Reynolds 
Aluminium Prize for Architect
ural Students was announced on 
November 10.
Named to the jury by the 
American Institute of Architects, 
which administers the program 
were:
Joseph D. Murphy, FAIA, of 
St. Louis, a partner in the firm 
of Murphy and Mackey which 
won the 1961 R. S. Reynolds 
Memorial Award for distinguished 
achievement in architecture. This 
award was conferred for design 
of the Climatron, a building in 
the Missouri Botanical Garden.
Sam A. Hurst, AIA, dean of 
the University of Southern Cali
fornias School of Architecture, 
Los Angeles.
W. G. Lyles, AIA, of Columbia, 
South Carolina, known for his 
design of educational buildings, 
including the Clemson College 
and the Undergraduate Library 
at the University of South Caro* 
lina.
The jury will meet at AIA 
headquarters here January 8-9, 
and the national Prize will be 
presented during the AIA Con
vention in St. Louis, June 14-18, 
1964.
In the student prize program 
each participating college holds 
its own competition for the best 
original design of a building com
ponent in aluminum, with a $200 
prize for the winner. The col
leges winning designs are en
tered in the national competi
tion, which provides $2,500 for 
the winning student and $2,500 
for his school. The program is 
sponsored by Reynolds Metal 
Company.

Sorority Rush...
Frosh View 
Presents
Dilemma
Faces, smoke, gossip, discus
sions. Making endless circles as 
sorority rush stamps question 
marks on the forehead of every 
freshman girl. Which one? Where 
will I be the happiest? Do they 
like me; will they bid me? Did 
I say the right thing? I doubt it. 
Why must I get so tongue twist
ed? Im not really that nervous.
If one more person asks me 
where Im from and what Im ma
joring in, Ill die. I wonder if 
they find me easy to talk to or 
did I seem like a frozen little 
girl? I can just imagine what they 
say about me at those after-theparty bull sessions.
Youre suppose to evaluate each 
sorority and find the one that 
best fits your personality and your 
needs. But what if two or three 
fill those needs? Then you have to 
eliminate. I hope I dont hurt 
anyones feelings  theyve all 
been so nice to me. Will they 
understand?
At the beginning it was just 
plain fun. Now its serious busi
ness. I dont want to make a mis
take. Perhaps I should just drop 
out of rush. Lots of my friends 
are doing it. Its the easy way out 
and it seems like it would solve 
my problems. Im sick of getting 
opinions. Should I listen to my 
friends or should I follow my in
tuitions? Can I trust my own 
judgment?
Theres so much to be consid
ered. The actives, the prospective 
pledges, their reputation. I like 
that girl, but shes a senior and 
shell be gone in June. I wonder 
what fraternity guys think of the 
sorority.
Monday is creeping closer. 
Should I make a second choice on 
my ballot, just in case? No. Ive 
decided. These girls will be my 
sisters for four years and per
haps for life. Rush is over. Now 
all I can do is wait and pray they 
like me as much as I like them.
Sororities 
Evaluate 
Rush Week
At least two sides are expect
ed to be presented in any story, 
and this is the case with sorority 
rush  the two sides here being, 
of course, the sorority girls and 
the rushees.
Despite the upset that rush 
gives to regular routine, it is 
looked upon by sorority women 
as a week of anxiety, tension, but 
most of all, excitment  the excitment of competition and a feel
ing of pride and success as each 
group surveys its fine pledge 
class.
Carnegie, this year, like last 
year, had its sorority rush com
pressed into one hectic week of 
open houses, theme parties, and 
final parties. The highlight or 
climax of all of this activity came 
on Tuesday, November 26, when 
preferential bid lists and open 
bids were made up and given out.
A long-run analysis shows that 
the general feeling of the ma
jority or sorority women, how
ever, seems to be that a longer 
rush delayed until the second se
mester is more desirable than the 
rush under the present set-up. 
This year sororities were pri
marily handicapped by the fact 
that such a small portion of fresh
men girls made the grades that 
would make them eligible for 
first semester pledging. When the 
usual rush drop-outs were added 
to this list, the quota for each 
sorority was only nine. With sec
ond semester rush, more girls 
would probably be eligible and 
the quota higher.
A short-run analysis, however, 
shows the general feeling of each 
sorority woman to be merely a 
deep breath, a sigh, and a phrase, 
Thank goodness, this week is 
over!

. > -- . VThirty outstanding seniors in 
I the College of Engineering and 
[ Science, Carnegie Institute of

"^experimental industrial round ta
ble program beginning next 
I month.
The program is sponsored by 
E the Carnegie Tech branch of the 
I YMCA in cooperation with the 
I YMCA South Pittsburgh Indus trial Management Club. Its purI pose is to give top seniors headed 
I towards a career the opportunity 
to explore together some of the 
non-technical problems of indusExecutive Council Explains 
Cancel of Demonstration
The plan was conceived beI cause of the management de| mands being placed upon profes- I sional engineers who find that af- I ter five years they are no longer 
I working at the technical tasks 
I for which they were trained, but 
I instead are daily dealing with 
I problems of personnel morale, and 
policy decisions. The problems in^Wvolve an evaluation of ethical and 
human factors for which they 
have received little preparation 
in their technical education.
The round table meetings will 
! bring industrial management peo
ple to the campus for discussions 
of management problems. Plans 
for the first three meetings have 
been made and include discus
sions of Competition for Ad
vancement: The Ethics of ProEfr motion, Key Problems on the 
f Job for Which I was Least Pre| pared by My Technical Educa
tion, and Company Loyalty and 
Personal Conflicts. Resource peo
ple for the first three meetings 
will be from The Dravo Corpora
tion, Jones and Laughlin Steel 
Corporation, and Westinghouse 
Air Brake Company. The group 
will meet eight times during the 
school year in Skibo, Carnegie 
Techs campus activities center.
Lawrence N. Canjar, associate 
dean of the college of Engineer
ing and Science, is faculty advi
sor for the project, and Mr. C. 
Donald Engle, assistant to the 
manager, Pittsburgh Works, Jones

L Perlis Lauds 
Computors
Alan J. Perlis, professor and 
head of the department of math
ematics and directors of Carnegie 
Techs Computation Center, dis
cussed A Proper Reverence For 
Computers at the November 19 
assembly before a capacity audi
ence in the Wherett Lounge.
Dr. Perlis began his presenta
tion by discussing the four main 
parts of every computer; mem
ory, control, communication, and 
information transformation. The 
two aspects of designing compu
ters involve the hardware con
struction of the machine and the 
programming of material to be 
computed.
According to Dr. Perlis, com
puters are changing constantly 
and improving every day. The 
amount Of memory that can be 
stored, the speed of computation, 
and the speed of communication 
are all increasing in great strides. 
The number of computers being 
used in the world, he stated, will 
double in the next few years.
Dr. Perlis compared the in
creasing complexity of compu
ters to the increasing refinement 
of a professional football team 
over a college football team. In 
both cases there is now more in
volved and complicated memory, 
cnotrol, communication, and in
formation transfer (physical 
movemont in the case of football.)
The variety of subjects which 
are computable is enormous. In 
a sense computors were designed 
to try models, and since most of 
the models that are to be ana[ continued on page 10]

Congress proposal. The Executive 
Council obtained partial assurance 
that the administration would re
instate Friday next. Because of 
this a demonstration, it was be
lieved, could only harm the vaca
tion campaign.
On the legislative side of the 
hill, Congress leader Pyke and 
chairman Powell were impressed 
with Executive Councils reasons 
and also the tragic developments 
on the national scene. It was 
agreed that if the administration 
persists in its narrow minded
ness, to quote Jack Turk, and re
peats Friday classes in 64 an even 
more effective demonstration 
could be held after Thanksgiving.
Executive Councils reasons for 
postponing the demonstration in
clude:
1. That we feel that we repre
sent, student opinion in that we 
desire the reinstatement of this 
vacation for th academic year 
1964-1965.
2. That there has been no evi
dence that the previous request oi 
Student Government has been 
disregarded or that further action 
by Student Government is re
quired at this time.
3. That the Executive Council of 
Student Government is taking 
steps to insure that no demon
stration takes place as previously 
passed by Student Congress.
4. That we are confident that 
sufficient information regarding 
Thanksgiving vacation 1964 has 
reached the Executive Board, and 
that the vacation will be rein
stated.
New AAUW 
To Accept All 
Women Grads
An amendment to the By-laws 
of the American Association of 
University Women makes all 
women graduates of Carnegie In
stitute of Technology eligible for 
membership in the AAUW. The 
amended by-laws read:
The Association shall maintain 
a list of institutions whose grad
uates are qualified for member
ship. When an institution which 
offers at least a recognized bac
calaureate or higher degree and 
which has full regional accredi
tation requests listing, the Asso
ciation shall place it on the 
AAUW list of qualified institu
tions and admit to membership, 
upon application any woman 
graduate of that institution who 
holds a baccalaureate or higher 
degree.
Heretofore only graduates of 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege have been eligible for mem
bership in American Association 
of University Women.

lyzed are mathematical, they are 
easily computed. But many mod
els dealing with abstractions are 
also computed. Some of the new 
uses of computers are correlating 
university courses and professors, 
and composing cartoons and mu
sic.
Every professional person 
should be aware of the impor
tance of computers, according to 
Dr. Perlis, because their influ
ence will be seen more and more 
each year. The engineer must 
realize computers now perform 
many menial tasks better than 
men, and the engineer must try 
to design even more efficient ma
chines.
The scientists are, for the most 
part, interested in the pursuit of 
truth through models, and computors are now being used to pre
dict experiments and to analyze 
data. The artist must be aware 
that this is a man-machine world 
and he must be able to translate 
his esthetic impressions of life in
to terms which the scientific and 
mechanical world will understand.
Dr. Perlis believes that ones 
relationship to computers in this 
day and age is comparable to 
ones relationship to organized re
ligion or government. He feels 
that the intelligent way to look 
at computers is to view them as 
the beginning of a long chain of 
advances which will enable man 
to raise his standards of living 
and to avoid ultimate extinction.
He concluded by stating that, 
asas future professional people, it is necesary for every college stu
dent to understand the implica
tions of computers in the manmachine world in which he is 
committedd to live.**

Seven Teams in Race
As the I. M. bowling schedule 
approaches the halfway mark, all 
three leagues are characterized by 
two-team races. In the Strikes 
league, Sigma Nu has compiled a 
7-1 record and holds a one game 
margin over second place BTP 
A. The Dorm-Trojans B are 
a distant third with a 4-4 record, 
while PKT and the Marauders are 
next in line with identical 3-5 
records. ATO has claimed only 
one victory in eight decisions.
In the Spares league, the Grad 
Eagles are unbeaten in eight 
starts, while DTD is just one game 
behind. TDP A is next with a 
5-3 standing, and the DormWhales B follows with a 4-4 
mark. Neither DU nor KS has yet 
been able to crack the victory 
column.
In the Splits league, the DormTrojans A, with a 7-1 record 
hold a one game margin over both 
SAE and BSR. BTP B and TDP 
B have identical 2-6 marks, 
while the Dorm-Whales A have 
been able to register only one vic
tory in eight decisions.
DTD has the highest team aver
age with a 796, while BTP A 
has a 785 mark and the DormTrojans A 778. Individually,
George Kali of Sigma Nu has 
compiled a 178 average, Bob 
Boeckman of DTD is averaging 
174, as is Kieth Pierce of BTP,

are closely followed by the DormTrojans, the Betas, and the Mar

The Carnegie Tech Varsity 
Rifle Team won its first duel meet 
of the year at Grove City by 
dwoning the Grovers 1384-1368. 
Techs score was their lowest of 
the season but it was good enough 
to take Grove City in spite of the 
fact that the match was held in 
the Grovers range.
Sophomore Bob Fritz shot his 
best ever with prone-kneelingstanding scores of 100-95-90 for 
a total of 285. Captain Phil 
Meyers followed with a 282 and 
Mike Kneply fired a 280. After 
that, things looked rather poor 
for Tech. Scott McCormick placed 
fourth with a 269 and Dick Danberg rounded out the Tartan scor
ing with a 268.
It was the same old story for 
who had to count on a

to easy victories over the NADS 
and KS. Beta Theta Pi also won 
their two matches in the Paso 
League by defeating the NADS 
and Sigma Nu Kappa Sigs record 
was kept at 1-1 as they knocked 
off Sigma Nu in their opening 
game.
SAE, last years runner-up, 
coasted to victories over the Tech
nocrats and ATO B, paced by 
their top spiker Howie Gammon. 
The second place spot was left all 
jumbled up with ATO B taking 
DTD and the Delts and the Tech
nocrats defeating the Dunkers to 
create a three-way second place 
tie.
Tau Delta Phi, with spiker Jon , 
Bordfsky, won their first two over 
the Grad Falcons and DU. The 
Dorm-Trojans, an up-and-coming 
power in intramural sports, also 
won their first two games by beat
ing the Grads and BSR. Beta Sig 
won their only other game over 
DU.

Co-Ree Goes To 
Grad Eagles
The powerful Grad Eagles made 
it two championships in two tries 
as they swept through the CO-Rec 
Volleyball play-offs, beating ATO 
and then SAE for the champion
ship. It was steady, consistent 
play that won for the Grads who 
simply made less mistakes than 
their opponents.
Against ATO, the Grads took 
the first game, lost the second 
game by two points, and then let 
the Taus beat themselves in the 
third game to take the match.
While the Grads were defeat
ing ATO, SAE was overcoming 
TDP. . The Tau Delts managed a 
good lead early in the first game 
which carried them through, but 
strong SAE play proved decisive 
as the next two games and the 
match went to SAE.
With one victory each that 
evening, SAE and the Grads went 
into the finals. Although SAE 
had yet to lose and the Grads 
had one loss already on the sea
son, SAE was unable to solidify 
its defense against the years of 
experience of the Grads and lost 
two straight for a second place 
behind the Eagles in Co-Rec 
In the consolidation game, 
could not recoop from their 
loss, and TDP was able to gain 
a third place with a victory over 
the Taus.

Valuable Football Seniors Retire: 
All Praise Coach; Regret Losses
Carnegie Techs football team 
will lose over 700 yards rushing, 
half their complete passes, 56 
points in touchdowns and con
versions, and scores of key blocks 
and tackles this time. A third 
of the backfield, two guards, an 
end and a tackle will receive di
plomas from Dr. Warner.
Coach Gasparella will have to 
dig to replace the six senior regu
lars. Halfback A1 Abels ended 
four years in a Tech uniform with 
over 1,300 yards to his credit. For 
the second year he was most valu
able player. A. G. leaves smil
ing at jokes about his money 
and a little burned up at a mis
quoted artivle from a fly-by night 
scandal sheet, from the Pittsburgh 
Sports Weekly, reprinted in the 
Tartan. Terry Hechler, Tartan 
aerial artist, made this his best 
season out of four as he keyed on 
Tedi's new offense with 26 points 
on passes. His talented toe con
tributed fine punting and kickoff 
yardage at a 38-yard average. 
Terry remembers with a grin one 
of his foggy profs asking once, 
Do you really practice for your 
games? Terry heads for a career 
in graphis design. Tartan end, 
Rich Ferguson, looks back on four 
lettered seasons with nostalgia

corner in Carnegie football, and

this as their best season. Gasjerella and his staff are the finest 
Ive played under, stated Fergu
son, echoing Baldouf and Palmo. 
All commented on the spirit which 
built up throughout the season. 
The crowd at homecoming was 
inspiring, put in Palmo. Most 
felt that despite the score and 
the weather, the second half 
against powerful W. & J. was the 
high point of the season. We 
caught fire, quipped Baldauf. 
We got em rattled, started roll
ing and knew we could win, re
plied Abels who sparked that 80- 
yard drive.
In the future the seniors see a 
brighter sophomore season for 
Coach Gasparella. Some freshmen 
to look for in shoe-filling roles 
are Pete Bair, Dave Gilchrist, and 
Gary Mernok.
Yet the seniors felt moved to 
pin down several problems the 
team may have to face. Wed 
become conditioned losers, after 
three years under excoach Hersh
berger, said Baldauf. When we 
went out in the opener against 
Ohio Wesleyan and scored in the 
first minute it was hard to be
lieve. We didnt know what to 
do. Abels added that the team 
always seemed to be waiting As 
Heckler put it, we let the oppo
sition take the initiative and play
ed to their level. "But the team 
hung onto every game throughout 
the season. W. & J. was the 
margin of a bad center or a 
penalty. Even at Rochester it was 
touch and go till the end.
But perhaps a more serious 
problem than a winning philoso
phy is depth. We had 30 guys 
in uniform but only 15 were real 
players, said Baldauf. Its rough 
to play 55 minutes out of a 60- 
minute game, replied Groll. Pal
mo put it well, You bash the 
guy opposite you for four or five 
plays till youre both puffing, 
then the next play theres a new 
face and a clean uniform on the 
other side. A little later the first 
ones back rested and ready for 
more. Abels feels its hard to 
go 100 per cent on ever play when 
you .know theres no one behind 
you on the bench.
The controversial issue of ath
letic scholarships is one on which 
the seniors agree. We need
them! Heckler and Baldauf were 
two of the last Stephen Fund 
holders. Kent admits he wouldnt 
have come here without this foot
ball scholarship. Ferguson, Abels 
and Palmo have some type A 
academic aid. Every school we 
play, except possibly F. & M., 
gives scholarships or under the
table aid aid to athletes said1 
Groll. A few scholarships a year 
would build the nucleus of a 
strong team, commented Heckler. 
Terry believes that a scholarship 
program could be coordinated with 
the schools academic aims. Stand
ards of minimum grades and fi
nancial need could be maintained.

Inside the line are a pair of 
four-year scappers,, Kent Baldauf, 
guard, and Duane Palmo, tackle. 
Each played both offense and de
fense and replacements for in
jured Baldauf in several games 
were hard to find. Both went to 
convey the teams thanks to Gasperella and his first year staff of 
Fay, Quatse, Brown, Meyleo, and 
McCabe for the best tutelage in 
several years. Guard Frank Groll 
joined the Tartan squad in his 
sophomore year after a gym in
structor, impressed with his touch 
ability, encouraged him to go out. 
The support of the fans this year 
was great. Im just sorry we let 
them down, Frank added.

Allegro means "brisk and lively, which certainly 
describes Ford Motor Companys new dream car, 
a handsome fastback coupe. More than that, Allegro 
has unique functional features that could be adapted 
for future production cars. (This has already occurred 
in the case of retractable seat belts!)
A major innovation is a cantilever-arm steering 
wheel with an electronic "memory." The steering 
wheel is mounted on an arm that extends from a 
center-mounted column. The wheel swings upward 
for easy exit, returns automatically to its former 
position at the touch of a button. Power adjustment 
enables it to be moved three inches fore and aft and 
five inches vertically. This, plus power-adjustable
foot pedals, permits use of a fixed seat.design for 
low overall height.
Basically a two-seater in present form, Allegro has 
rear floor space that could be converted to carry 
two additional passengers. The car could be powered 
by either a V-4 made by Ford of Germany or by the 
domestic 144- or 170-cubic-inch Sixes.
Allegro is one of a series of Ford-built dream cars 
which will be shown at the New York Worlds Fair 
to test consumer reaction to styling and mechani
cal innovations. This will help determine which of 
their forward-looking features are destined for the 
American Roadas further examples of Ford Motor ' 
Companys: leadership in styling and engineering.
