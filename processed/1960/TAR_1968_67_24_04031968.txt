New College of HumanitiesPass-Fail, Metacurrfeulum
Sometine this month the "new 
college" of Humanities and So
cial Sciences will be formally 
christened. Although men will be 
receiving degrees this June, the 
I first freshman classs will not ar
rive until the fall of 1969 and the 
first of the experimental courses 
will begin then.
When Dean Steinberg and his 
committee released their plans for 
the college last fall, they were 
both praised and criticized. Some 
students who read or heard the 
report reacted with: "It cant hap
pen here." It will happen here 
and within the next five years 
CMU should be a front-running 
liberal university, not just another 
name for Carnegie Tech. Along 
with the new college, there will 
be a graduate school of urban af
fairs, perhaps the first successful 
venture of this nature, and there 
may also be a radically restruc
tured engineering and science 
I curriculum.
Freshmen will work on a passfail basis, at the end of the year 
receiving only one grade based 
on the instructors evaluations. 
The adoption of such a concept 
will remove the traditional percentage-point pressure and allow 
the student to take risks in ex
ploring new intellectual ground. 
Although nearly all of his courses 
^ will be chosen for him the first 
year, the student will not have to 
distribute his attention equally in 
order to maintain a good average. 
He will be encouraged to devote 
more of his energy to the fields 
which interest him most.
As a safeguard against abuses, 
the plans call for faculty precep
tors who will be in close contact
> with perhaps a dozen students, 
checking on their progress and 
guiding them when they run into 
problems. The student will al
ways know that he has a precep
tor that he can and should go to.
If the student's problem is seri
ous. the preceptor will also be 
able to guide him to a study skills 
center or to the counseling cen
ter.
Several programs of the college 
will be run as pilot projects next 
year, one of these being the meta
curriculum. Under this name will 
develop a group of programs de
signed to give the student oppor
tunits to encounter non-academic 
life. He will be required to do 
something outside the curriculum 
such as spelunking in West VirI ginia. visiting a festival at an eth
nic church, viewing the Russian 
film Atoms for Peace, or talking 
with artists, poets, craftsmen. John 
Birchers or black militants. The 
metacurriculum is currently be
ing planned by a student-facultv 
committee, but when established 
it will enable students to create 
their own choices for non - aca
demic activity. For the freshman 
it will be an initiation to experi
ences outside the realm of paren
tal influence and for the upper
classman it will be an opportun
ity to expand his view and to spe
cialize.
In conjunction with the metacurriculum, the freshman will be 
a member of a free seminar group. 
Composed of a dozen students, 
two seniors and a faculty preeetor, it will be a free-wheeling 
weekly discussion over coffee. 
The seniors will participate as 
members of the seminar but will 
also introduce freshmen to peo
ple other than instructors and 
other freshman.

Pitt Ends Contract; 
Move Out of War
The Washington office wrote 
technical reports on everything 
from fuzes to missiles. with an 
estimated 20 per cent of its work 
on chemical and biological weap
ons and about 40 per cent of its 
work classified.
SANE S report called for an of
ficial  inquiry into off-campus 
ordinance research" and stated 
the belief that such an investi
gation would be followed by a 
faculty move to discontinue such 
work." This fall Pitt's adminis
tration made the decision not to 
renew the contracts under which 
Pitt's Army Material Research 
staff operates. This represents an 
encouraging first move towrard 
getting the University out of the 
war business specifically and out 
of the role of slave to government 
policy generally.
"Fuzes" was consistently so 
spelled in all of the offices re
ports.
President Stever Gives Administrations 
Response to Student Draft Petition
Thd Administration has consid
ered the petition signed by some 
650 students requesting that, in 
the light of General Hersheys 
letter of October 26, 1967, to lo
cal Selective Service Boards, the 
University suspend military re
cruiting on the campus until the 
letter has been rescinded, over
ruled, or clarified by the courts.
The petition requests CMU as 
an institution to suspend military 
recruiting on the campus as a 
means of bringing pressure on the 
United States Government to resind the Hershey letter. Although 
many of us individually thing 
that the Hershey letter was, and 
is. at fault, we do not feel that 
it would be proper to act as the 
petition requests. There are sev
eral reasons for this:
1. Permission for representa
tives from any recognized organ
ization engaged in legal activities 
to recruit on our campus is given 
on the basis that a service is be
ing performed for some portion of 
our student body. We will not 
distinguish among such organiza
tions. Moreover, we feel that we 
thve an obligation to the organi
zations and to the students who 
are served to see that this ser
vice is made available without 
discrimination.
2. The suspension of military re
cruiting is not a proper response 
to General Hersheys act. General 
Hershey does not work for the 
military, nor they for min, and 
there has been no indication that 
the military services share the 
Selective Service report to the 
President. To respond in the man
ner proposdd in the petitovn would 
place the University in the posi
tion of taking an unjust and arbitary action aagainst one group 
of governmental organizations to 
counter an arbitary statement by a 
representataive of another govern
mental organization.
3. Following General Hersheys 
letter of October 26. a joint state
ment by Attorney General Clark 
and General Hershey was issued 
on Decomber 9. Quoting from 
that.
I.an fttl protest activities, whet
her directed to the draft or other 
national issues, do not subject re
gistrants to acceleration or any 
oilier special administrative act
ion by tin* Selective Service Sys
tem. Activities which violate Fed
eral law will he dealt with under 
the procedures outlined above 
depending upon the nature of the 
conduce. The lawful exercise of 
rights of free expression and peace
ful assembly have incurred and 
will incur no penalty or other ad
verse action. These rights un
guaranteed by the Constitution. 
They are vital to the preservation 
of free institutions, which our 
men in Vietnam are fighting to 
protect.
To the best of my knowledge 
this policy is being followed. 
Therefore if there are to be law
ful demonstrations participated in 
by our students against recruiting 
or any Selective Service action I 
would prefer to have them on 
campus. Here we have some capa
bility of helping to keep the de
monstrations lawful and thus keep
ing our students out of jeoparty. 
Off campus, outsiders could easi
ly convert a lawful demonstration 
to an illegal one.
Although I do not believe it is 
appropriate for the University to 
pursue the course advocated in 
the petition, I do plan to write 
to President Johnson and our cong
ressmen expressing the continuing 
concern of some of our students 
and faculty over the Hershey 
memorandum and its subsequent 
interperations.
The students who signed this 
petition are to be commended for 
expressing their views on and tak
ing a stand on a matter of both 
local and national importance.
200 CMU Students 
Join McCarthy Band
Students interested in further
ing the campus campaign for pres
idential candidate Senator Eu
gene McCarthy are invited to at
tend a meeting Thursday, April
4. at 1:30 pm. Porter Hall 100. 
This will be the last meeting of 
the Students for McCarthy Com
mittee prior to McCarthys visit 
this spring.
The present status of the cam
paign will be discussed by Ed 
Fuller, a graduate student in Com
puter Sciences, chairman of Stu
dents for McCarthy.
According to Fuller. "The stu
dent response to McCarthy thus 
far has been overwhelming. But 
we are still intent upon enlisting 
further student support.
Thd organizational meeting of 
CMU Students for McCarthy last 
Thursday drew 100 students. Since 
then almost 100 more CarnegieMellon people have joined the 
McCarthy forces.
McCarthy organizations have 
already been operating on thd Pitt 
and Duquesne campuses for sev
eral weeks, and this past week
end a busload of students from 
St. Vincent and" Seton Hill Col
leges in Latrobe. Pa., rode into 
town to campaign for the sena
tor.
Workers are needed for can
vassing from 10 am to 1 pm Sat
urdays and at 1 pm Sundays. Stu
dents are also needed for voter 
contact and clerical duties a t 
Pittsburgh McCarthy headquar
ters.
In addition to helping the Pitts
burgh headquarters with these 
tasks, the CMU committee is also 
urging all students over 21 not 
to forget to east their own votes 
in the primaries. Votihg students 
from primary states other than 
Pennsylvania can send home ab
sentee ballots.
Thd CMU committee is now 
planning campaign activities for 
spring vacation. Living accomo
dations will be made for those 
wishing to stay on campus to aid 
in the campaign

EDITORIAL
You Have Three Weeks, 
Mr. Tipker.
Mr, Tipkers response to last weeks editorial on housing clearly 
demonstrates the lack of understanding that the administration has for 
the students problem. Instead of trying to understand the problem, 
he has simply tried to rationalize the present situation by appealing 
to such irrational arguments as the popularity of the hill dorms and the 
stealing of furniture.
First of all, Mr. Tipker, the reason that the hill dorms are more 
popular is a matter of relativity. No matter how broken down the hill 
dorms are, relative to the new ones, they have to appear much more 
desirable. The new dorms are drab, noisy, either too warm, or too cold, 
contain designed-in fire hazards, and no amount of originality can make 
them any better than a cell in the state prison. Decrepit as they may 
be, the hill dorms still represent the better alternative. And for the 
freshman and non-fraternity sophomore, there is no other alternative, 
for the administration has cleverly required them to live in the dorms. 
As a large portion of the juniors and seniors have discovered, it is 
possible to rent an apartment at a comparable price and get a much 
more satisfactory living environment. This, Mr. Tipker. should not'be 
possible.
Secondly, it appears to be Mr. Tipkers contention that it is the 
residents who draw the rats from the surrounding area. This is 
absurd. The fact that there are rats in the surrounding area is no ex
cuse for there being rats here, and it is the archaic housing, not the 
students, that draw the rats. Also. Mr. Tipker suggests that steambugs are a necessary evil and that even some hospitals are plagued 
by them. What he fails to mention is that these very same hospitals 
are even more decrepit than the hill dorms. The fact that the sur
rounding area is run down is no excuse for our dormitories being run 
down. I will agree that steam circulates through the pipes (some
times) to provide heat and hot water (sometimes), but I feel that at 
the price of $500 a year, a student deserves more than "heat and hot 
water.
The fact that the administration is aware of fire hazards and is 
investigating them is no consolation to the student who each day risks 
his life when he steps into his dormitory. Students want action and 
they want it now.
Mr. Tipker feels that he can explain away the deficiencies of the 
old dorms by blaming these deficiencies on their old age. This is an 
out and out admission that these dorms are inadequate and that 
they should be replaced now. Also, how does he explain away the in
adequate housekeeping and the absense of screens on the windows of 
Boss and McGill Halls (after all. it is hard to keep bugs out without 
them.)
As to the stolen furniture. Mr. Tipker, you fail once again to 
realize that this theft would probably never have taken place had the 
rooms been properly furnished in the first place.
In short, Mr. Tipker, your argument is unsound, illogical, and 
nothing more than an attempt to explain away something which cannot 
be explained away. The fact that the administration is dreaming of 
a coeducational housing complex which could theoretically be enacted 
somewhere in the distant future does not solve the problems when 
they need to be solved, which is now. You cannot promise the students 
a rose garden world which will completely satify the class of 79 and 
hope that this will suffice in appeasing them. What we are concerned 
about is the present. We are paying exorbitant fees to go to this school 
and we expect housing which is something better than a collection of 
outmoded and run-down dormitories. We feel tliat we deserve more 
than this, and we want it now.
You have three weeks. Mr. Tipker.

Law Students Note 
Deferment Policy
Editor the Tartan:
Thd recent Selective Service 
announcement concerning gradu
ate school ddferments means that 
a number of pre-law college sen
iors may defer their legal educa
tion until completion of military 
service. In order to give them 
a greater sense of security about 
law school entrance when they re
turn, Case Western Reserve 
School has adopted a guaranteed 
deferred admissions plan. As al
ways. students who are drafted 
while in the law school or who 
leave to enter the military before 
completing their law studies will 
have the right to return on com
pletion of their service. If a stu
dent should be called to service in 
the middle of a term, the law 
school will contact his local board 
and request that induction be de
layed until completion of the 
semester's work.
In the future, any admitted ap
plicants who indicates his inten
tion to enter the law school but 
who is drafted or who voluntarily 
enlists in the military before he 
begins his law studies can be cer
tain about his admission to the 
School upon completion of his ob
ligation. Every Effort will be 
made to place him in the earliest 
entering class after his release 
from service. Only a brief reap
plication need be filed. Readmis
sion will only be denied in the 
case of conduct in the interim 
period which reflects adversely 
on one's moral capacity to enter 
the legal profession. The deferred 
admissions policy will apply to 
those who go into the service to 
fulfill ROTC obligations and 
those who enter reserve programs 
with a six-month or shorter period 
of active duty.
It is*our hope and expectation 
that a large number of present 
college seniors will plan to en
ter law school next fall. How
ever, we would like students to 
be aware of the deferred admis
sions option.
Sincerely yours.

Assistant Dean

Physical Education: 
General Play Period
Editor, the Tartan:
I feel that it should be brought 
to evervones' sttention what is go
ing on over there on Tech St. in 
the Physical Education Dept. 
They have spent reportedly $4,100 
on new gym equipment that has 
been used less than two weeks. 
This equipment is the newly arriv
ed gymnastic apparatus: high bar. 
parallel bars, side horse, and bal
ance beam. Classes have used this 
equipment from March 18, to 
March 27. 1968. That is less than 
two weeks of school: it is one and 
one half weeks. The equipment is 
being removed. The reason given 
to me by one of the physical ed
ucation instructors was that few 
people could do anything on the 
equipment that was in the least 
bit difficult. The examples given 
by the instructor were front and 
back rises on the parallel bars, 
which were immediately demon
strated for him by two members 
of the group confronting him.
The fact that people can do 
these exercises is not the point. 
The point is that the instructors 
dont want to take the time to 
teach anything to students that 
the students dont already know 
how to do. Is the job of these in
structors to teach gym or is it 
to supervise a general play per
iod where nothing is learned or 
can be learned what is the pur
pose of having a Physical Educa
tion Dept.?
If the administration feels that 
all that is necessary for the gym 
classes are playground directors 
then I am sure that they could 
find some high school graduates 
that would be able to do the job 
very well. This would be cheaper 
than the present system and would 
have about the same effect on the 
students in the classes. If the ad
ministration doesn't feel this way 
the maybe it should take a look 
into the present system which it 
is supporting and change this in
to a real Physical Education De
partment with the emphasis on 
EDUCATION.

Realistic Standpoint 
Given by Ron Haan
Editor, the Tartan
As one who is directly invol
ved with Student Government and 
issues on campus. I have been 
viewing the candidacies for the 
presidency of the Student Govern
ment with concern.
It is unfortunate that the ma
terial printed earlier in this pa
per will serve as the only source 
of judgment for so many read
ers. And yet. by simply studying 
the statement of each aspirant, 
enough can be realized to make 
a fair judgment as to which is the 
best candidate.
Two candidates go from one ex
treme of wanting Dr. Stever to 
sit in at all Senate and committee 
meetings, to the other of bdlieving that "the administration 
should not enter into policy-making." To strengthen Student Gov
ernment. the direction of a much 
more realistic standpoint must be 
taken.
Ron Haan. the only candidate 
to express concern for living con
ditions on campus, has that real
istic and direct standpoint. Mr. 
Haan has for a long time taken 
part in student affairs, instituting 
many constructive programs on 
campus. His goals are equally con
structive and attainable. His ap
proach to the relationship be
tween the Student* Government 
and the admisistration is one of 
both cooperation and strength.
As a student and resident on 
campus. I would seriously think 
of voting for Ron Haan. and as the 
President of Mens Dormitory 
Council. I would look forward 
to cooperating extensively with 
Ron Haan.

SCORE Interest 
Spreads Past CMU *
Editor, the Tartan:
As part of the student com
munity of the Pittsburgh area, we 
would like to express our opinion 
of the newly formed organization. 
SCORE. After reading the Mar. 
20th edition of the Tartan, we 
were impressed with the concept 
of individual responsibility ad
vocated by members of SCORE # 
and by the courage initiative 
which must be at the root of such 
a movement.
Recently, we had the opportun
ity to discuss the issue with a 
CMU student. However, his at
titude was identical to that of 
many, that is. general indiffer
ence to the whole situation. 
When questioned about his feel
ings toward the possible abolition of Student Government, he 
replied. "Why bother? They're 
just a nice friendly gourp of peo
ple who like to get together and 
argue about unimportant things. 
Theyre having fun! Why not 
leave them alone?
They're having fun. the man 
said. Indeed, if the purpose of 
student governments is to have j 
fun. let's spread the work. It 
should definitely boost attendance 
at meetings. Everyone enjoys a 
little fun.)
One point which our friend did 
venture to comment on was the 
fact that the referendum whould 
be handled outside the Student 
Government. This, he claimed, is 
shaky. He seems to think that 
it should be conducted within the i| 
Government's jurisdiction. Seeing 
that we were not quite sold on 
this idea, the student went on to 
explain to us that "one must play 
by the rules. in this case, the 
rules of the very organization 
which would be abolished!
Those of us who must come to 
grips with;the same problems be 
ing faced by SCORE are await
ing the outcome of this contro- W 
versv anxiously. Whether or not 
SCORE succeeds in its aims will 
have far more influence than the 
mere boundaries of CMU. We 
wish the co-odinators of this op 
eration well, despite the over
whelming odds they must defeat 
within their own student body 
before their objectives can be 
achieved. ^
Sincerely.

Editor. The Tartan: ^
This letter is primarily address
ed to those people who spent so 
much time, effort, and personal 
funds in the hopeless cause of 
convincing CMU students that 
they should take upon themselves 
the responsibility of running their 
own affairs without the interfer
ence of SG. I know we all start
ed with the high hopes of any >j
group of voung radicals and per
haps you now feel that SCORE 
was a waste of time because we 
did not achieve our stated goal 
of abolishing Student Govern
ment. But let me remind you that 
our small effort probably upset 
more members of the entrenched 
establishment (and that includes 
the student establishment as well 
as the Administration) than has i 
occured in quite a while.
I do not intend to change my 
view of the structure of control

Thanks Expressed 
to Score Supporters
on this campus and I will con
tinue to do everything I can to 
point out the inefficiences and 
stupidities of both SG and the 
Administration. I hope all of you 
come to the conclusion that SG 
is a croch of shit, to be buried 
in its own verbiage and ignored, 
will contine to agitate for what 
you want in any way you consi
der appropriate.
The day may not be so far awav 
when SG will be abolished by 
general disgust if the platforms 
of the candidates for SG presi
dent are any indication of the 
quality of the future campus lead
ers. If any of them had the balls 
to come out and say exactly what 
they have on their minds and 
what theyre going to try to do. 
perhaps there would be no prob
lem of apathy on campus.
The only exception to this would 
be Gary Straus who realizes that 
SG is better off dead and would 
be a good man to have on the in
side. This is no endorsement of 
Gary, but if everyone voted for 
SCORE would vote for Straus, he 
would almost assuredly win.
In closing let me give my per
sonal thanks to all of you who 
worked for SCORE and never 
complained when asked to work 
just a bit longer. I hope the name 
SCORE will be used in the fu
ture for any cause which finds 
itself embroiled in a controver
sy over the responsibility of the 
student to control his own affairs.
Gene L. Payne
Tipker Discusses 
TARTAN Editorial
Editor, The Tartan:
I have read your recent edi
torial, The $55 Million Capitol 
Fun Drive. In the interest of 
keeping the records straight, I 
feel compelled to respond.
There is not an administra
tor on our campus who will not 
support the fact that new un
dergraduate mens housing is de
sired at Carnegie-Mellon at the 
earliest possible time. On the 
other hand, the old hill dormi
tories may not be first-rate, yet 
they remain most popular in 
spite of their deficiencies. And 
by the way, it is my understand
ing that the next housing com
plex for undergraduate stu
dents will most likely be of the 
co-educational type featuring
common food service and recre
ational areas.
I wish to make the opportun
ity to discuss the accusations 
which have been levied against 
the old hiill dormitories. I beg 
to differ with your statement 
that the buildings are infested 
with rats and cockroaches. It is 
a known fact that the entire 
area of Pittsburgh surrounding 
the campus is a haven for rats, 
so these pests will be seen on 
the grounds from time to time.
I believe it is a rarity if such 
a rodent is seen in a corridor or 
a resident room, but if such is 
the case, there has to be a 
source of attraction developed 
by the resident(s). Steambugs 
are found occasionally each aca
demic year at which time the 
appropriate steps are taken to 
control them. Our exterminator 
has informed me that steam
bugs will be discovered in any 
buildings where there is warm 
moisure, such locations being in 
all buildings having steam heat. 
Although never desired in our 
residence halls, their presence is 
not indicative of poor house
keeping habits. Hospitals which 
are recognized for maintaining 
the highest of sanitary stan
dards are troubled with these in
sects.
There is no argument with 
your statement that steam lines 
are exposed in some resident 
rooms which is quite common 
in buildings this old. I hope 
you will agree that it is good 
to know that the steam does 
manage to circulate through the 
pipes to provide heat and hot 
water. Fire safety hazards are 
known and are being studied 
for possible corrections. Grant
ed, there is broken plaster 
around the frames of resident 
room doors this year as last 
year and the situation will be 
very noticeable again next year. 
Very often there is a correlation 
between the amount of broken 
plaster and the way that a door 
is used or abused through the 
course of an academic year. Stu
dents who have lived in the res
idence halls realize this and 
know that the summer mainten
ance program calls for the re
pair of plaster breaks and the 
painting of many rooms and 
public areas. Broken windows 
can be seen just about any time 
you look for them, but Mr. 
Wanetik, how often has anyone 
seen three panes of glass brok
en side by side in one window 
sash? I guess that this and 
other universities will have some
Fear Caused by Administration and Student Government
This campus or the majority 
of the active campus seems to 
be in a state of multiple fear. 
We are afraid of one thing or 
another, many of which are 
caused by the positions of the 
administration and Student Gov
ernment. The latest referendum, 
run by SCORE, is a good exam
ple of this. Another is the poli
cy of Student Government and 
its committees.
Many students who voted for 
the second choice on the SCORE 
referendum, were voting out of 
fear. Some feared that anarchy 
would result if there were no 
Student Government. Others 
feared that the CFP would fiill 
a power vacuum. A few were 
afraid that the abolishment of 
Student Government would make 
the Administration more power
ful than it already is. Some 
even feared that this small 
group called SCORE would set 
itself up as an obligachy led 
by Mr. Wanetik and Mr. Payne.
Taking the above, one at a 
time, we can see how there was 
nothing to fear. Student Gov
ernment has been abloished at 
Yale and no anarchy replaced it, 
but instead groups of responsi
ble students have formed and 
dealt directly with the adminis
tration. The problem at CMU 
would be finding the responsible 
student groups rather than sur
passing anarchy.
The CFP could be one of these 
groups. It is true that CFP 
might take over Spring Carni
val, but they control and run it 
now so what is the difference. 
They would probably do a bet
ter job by enlarging it and open
ing the entertainment to the 
public so as to make money 
rather than lose it as now done. 
Greek Singr 'which is run en
tirely by CIP is open to the entire campus so why would CFP 
keep Spring Carnival closed; it 
wouldnt make economic sense.
Homecoming could be taken 
over by the Alumni Association, 
which runs much of it now. 
Without the Student Govern
ment more weekends would be 
possible as a Winter Weekend 
and more Spring and Fall Week
ends. This would let the respon
sible student groups do some
thing on their own. For those 
who fear a CFP take over, all 
that would be necessary is a 
better weekend or Saturday 
night. You dont see the Experi
mental Film group worry about 
CFP when they put on a show; 
so why should anyone else.
The administration could in 
no way become more powerful 
than it is now. Up till last week 
no one had ever challenged 
them. Student Government has
nt and still doesnt. With Stu
dent Government abolished we 
couldnt be in a worse position 
than we are now. We would be 
in much better position because 
the Administration couldnt say, 
Go through Student Govern
ment, when you try to chal
lenge. They also know that Stu
dent Government wont stand 
up to them, so without Student 
Government they have nothing 
to gain and all to lose while we 
have nothing to lose and all to 
gain.
The idea of SCORE replacing 
Student Government with its 
own oligarchy was dismissed 
by Dean Browns statement. All 
a group would need to do if they 
didnt agree with the group in 
the prime power position is set 
up their own referendum. If any
thing SCORE could be more 
than one of many pressure 
groups within the student body.
Student Government itself is
broken glass and plaster as long 
as there are residence halls and 
students.
Now, I should pose a few ques
tions. In your editorial, why 
wasnt there a picture showing 
damage to the new furniture 
which was recently placed in 
the McGill Hall lounge? Why 
not a shot of each void space 
wrhere a piece of furniture has 
been borrowed from a lounge? 
Perhaps the robber-barrons and 
bigots from the Duquesne Club 
had need of these items? It is 
my belief that you have really 
scratched the bottom of the 
barrel to come up with only a 
little bit of dirt for your ef
forts. George E. Tipker

Military Recruiting 
Unfair To Campus
Editor, The Tartan:
The University Administration 
of Carnegie-Mellon University 
are considering, so we are told, 
the requests of both students and 
faculty for the immediate sus
pension of all military recruit
ing on our campus. Their current 
policy cannot stand any teat of 
logical or moral scrutiny, and it 
is only hoped that their current 
deliberations will not result in 
irrelevant arguments of academ
ic freedom, free speech and free
dom of information.
Wednsany,S dn omt, 14)
fearful. The members are afraid 
to confront or oppose anyone 
above them. When voting 
on whether to send Daile Peshel, 
Alan Witchner, and Susie Pliaks 
to California for Thanksgiving 
recess only one member had the 
guts to vote against alloting 
them money out of the Activity 
Reserve Fund ($700) for the 
trip. Student Government has 
never pressed the Administra
tion for anything, never set 
deadlines for action, never even 
demanded action. They never 
took a stand on last years tui
tion increase or this years food 
price increase.
The committees of Student 
Government are even a better 
example of the fearful students. 
The Finance Committee which 
is not made up of entirely sen
ators, work in fear. They will 
not increase the Student Gov
ernment budget over 33 per 
cent. Most budgets are cut 
somewhat or completely but 
Student Government never is. 
Why? Because the members of 
the Finance Committee like the 
jobs and their power and dont 
want to lose them. They never 
demand more than five per cent 
because it is in keeping with 
policy, and if they didnt keep 
within the standing policy they 
might be refused by the Ad
ministration. Refusal by the Ad
ministration is something which 
they dont want because they 
would either have to fight for 
more money or else redo the 
budget. If they had to fight 
that would make them lose their 
nice guy image with the Ad
ministration, another unheard of 
thing.
It is time that the campus 
and Student Government shake 
off their fears and demand of 
those above them their wants. 
The pyramid needs to be top
pled and reset with the students 
at the top with Student Gov
ernment and its committees be
low and with the Administration 
on the bottom. The students 
have to demand more from the 
Administration than it wants to 
give bargain for their demands.
Student Government and its 
committees must demand more 
of the students money from the 
Administration for the students 
needs, their activities. The Stu
dent Government has to reali*, 
they are working for the stu 
dents against the Administra
tion not the other way around.
Students must make their de
mands on Student Government 
and the Administration and not 
be satisfied till they are met. In 
short the power must be put 
where it belongs with the stu
dents and the demands on the 
Administration vice versa. The 
Administration of CMU cannot 
exist without the students but, 
the students can and would ex
ist without them. The students 
are in the power position, all 
that must be done is use that 
power.

Student Government Platforms *
JACQUELINE PRATT
I have no intention of running 
on a platform of promises. You. 
the student body, have heard 
promises every Spring only to dis
cover these promises are seldom 
fulfilled with the term of the of
ficial. This does not mean that I 
am not aware of your concerns 
on this campus for these are my 
concerns too.
I realize that the Administration sometimes seems to lack a 
consistent policy of sense of di
rection. I know the calendar is 
impossible with a lack of exam 
reading periods and split vaca
tions at Christmas and Inteses-^ 
sion. I am aware that the dorms 
are in sad need of improvement. 
Other items on a list of things 
which need changing are the lack 
of pass-fail courses, the need for 
more effective ID cards, perhaps 
with pictures, the establishment 
of a co-op type store, the restora
tion of Skibo as a student union 
for Tech students and the estab
lishment of some standards tor 
food service. However, these are 
concerns I would b e actively 
working towards even outside of 
the office of president of Student 
Government.
I sincerely feel that thinking 
as the student's representative, 
which if after all what the presi
dent should be. there is a more 
fundamental concern. Student 
Government should, ideally, be 
the organizational center for its 
five constituencies: independent 
commuters, independent dormi
tory men independent dormitory

women, sororities and fraterni
ties. However, an almost totallv 
complete communications break
down has occured. If one ques
tions students on campus about 
their gripes concerning Student 
Government, the question is us
ually answered by * what Student 
Government?"
First and foremost, before any 
major programs are undertaken 
Student Government is going to 
have to re-establish contact with 
the people it represents, There 
are some concrete, efficient 
means of doing this. Gripe shdets 
would be placed in strategic lo
cations all over campus, more stu
dent polls and ballots would be 
conducted, more publicity would 
be given Student Government 
meetings, including a beforehand 
publication of adgenda in addi
tion to more widespread publica
tion of minutes. Equally as imortant. a publication of Admin
istration decisions and policies 
would be issued. The president 
of Student Congress would be in 
attendance at each and every Con
gress meeting. "State of the Cam
pus" messages would be increseed from one per year to one per 
semester. At this time, there would 
also be reports from each stand
ing committee and each consti
tuency. Even the now inactive 
Student Court could function as 
a central focal group to discuss 
and make known the policies of 
the individual judicial bodies.
The development of a public 
image for Student Government is 
not to supplant action but rather 
to enhance action. Student Gov
ernment as an organizational cen
ter for its constituencies has vast 
potential for getting student de
sires fulfilled, taks accomplished, 
but. in addition to having more 
potential power than any inde
pendent group, it also has the re
sponsibility to be answerable to 
the student majority. This respon
sibility can only be carried out 
when the communications gap is 
closed and a rapport exists be
tween you and your Government 
and then vital action can take
place. I hope that you will join 
with me to re-establish communi
cations and put the bounce back 
into Student Government.

My platform has two pasic com
ponents. reform and action.
I shall propose and support sev
eral reforms in the general op
erating structure of the Student 
Government. These reforms will 
be directed toward giving the in
dividual students more voice in 
his government and also toward 
informing the entire campus com
munity as to what is happening 
within its government.
1. The first reform will be the 
establishment of a General As
sembly open to the entire under
graduate student body. The meet
ing will be presided over by the 
president of Student Government 
and will be opened with a report 
of happenings in the Senate and 
Executive Council during the pre
vious month. The floor will then 
be opened to any student wish
ing to speak on any campus prob
lem or need. Administration and 
student attendance will be invit
ed via publicitv in the Tartan and 
on WRCT.
2. Second on my agenda will be 
the establishment of free seats" 
in the Senate. There would be a 
maximum of four such seats per 
meeting which would be open to 
any undergraduate student. These 
seats will be filled on a firstW R C T is now

except KS and BSR 
900 KC.
come tirst-serve basis. To get a 
seat an interested person need 
only to submit a petition with 100 
signatures of undergraduate stu
dents one week before the meet
ing. This petition would entitle 
the student to the voting rights 
of a Senator for that one meet
ing. This will give groups of in
dividuals on campus with speci
fic needs a better chance to air 
their problems before the Senate
3. Next. I will see that there 
will be coverage of every meet
ing' both on WRCT and in the 
Tartan. This can be accomplish
ed by having a Tartan reporter at 
each Senate meeting and by hav
ing WRCT tape the meeting for 
broadcast.
4. This year's establishment of 
a Publicity Committee was a step 
in the right direction. Now we 
need to enlarge the effectiveness 
of this committee bv setting up 
well-kept bulletin boards at sev
eral more locations on campus.
The second segment of my plat
form  action, will be manifest 
in next year's government. It 
would appear form the number 
of candidates for the various of
fices that next year's government 
could well be the most active 
government on thi s campus. This 
obvious potential, however, can 
go unreleased if we do not elect 
leaders who will involve them
selves and direct the govern
ment toward solving campus prob
lems rather than wasting time try
ing to completely alter the form 
of the government. If elected. I 
plan to direct the Senate toward 
such goals as:
1. Establishing an effective committeee of interested students and 
faculty who will meet on a month
ly basis to discuss and make deftinite decisions on such topics as 
"Pass-Fail. " Co-ed Dormitories, 
or 24 hour open house.

2. School financial backing for 
Homecoming and Spring Carni
val. It can be seen from the plan
ning of this year's carnival that 
it is nearly impossible to obtain 
a good musical group or perform
er with the funds that can be rais
ed by ticket sales. We can forget 
Homecoming and Carnival if we 
cannot get financial support in 
the future.
3. Obtaining soft drink, cigar

for placement in Margaret Mor

yet been done.
4. Seeing that each campus ac
tivity is given the financial sup
port it needs to make it function 
at a level suitable of an organiza
tion affiliated with CarnegieMellon University.
In conclusion. I would like to 
say that if it were not for Stu
dent Government we would not 
have TGIF dances at which we 
could protest it.

A campus such as CarnegieMellons needs an efficient stu
dent government. The idea that 
individuals would be able to ef
fectively stage the campus acti
vities without any channel for 
their efforts is not feasible. To 
believe that a self appointed 
committee of a few students 
could have that a self appointed 
appropriation of funds from the 
administration is unrealistic; 
and to believe that to revamp 
student government it is first 
necessary to abolish it is absurd.
Rather than abolish student 
bovernment, my position is to 
enlarge it and increase its ef
fectiveness.

Secondly, our present Student 
Government is not as effective 
as it could-and should be. Both 
because of the attitude toward 
student government and inef
ficiencies within the structure. 
I would seek to have the Stu
dent Government communica
tion with the student body in
creased, both through the Mes:
de9 and WRCT. r would also 
have the names of the senators 
and their addresses posted so 
they could be easily contacted 
to allow them to be as represen
tative as possible.
Secondly, I find it necessary 
to increase interest and the re
spect for Student Government. 
I would want more acknowledge
ment to the Student Govern
ment on our campuses big week

informed student body with the 
favorable attitude toward help
ing Student Government would 
make it more powerful, and 
more representative of the ideas 
of the campus.

Finally I would try to con

make sure that the committees

has ever been done before.
BERNARD MEISNER
Commuters compose a large 
segment of the campus popula
tion and have special problems 
which differ from those of cam
pus residents. One of the big 
issues this year is the represen
tation of the students by their 
senators. I only learned who my 
representative was about two 
months ago, when I first became 
interested in Student Govern
ment. I have never been ap
proached by those who pretend 
to represent me concerning any 
issue. If I am elected as a com
muter representative, I plan to 
be just thata representative of 
commuters.
I have worked on the Senate 
Publicity Committee and I am 
also a brother in Alpha Phi Ome
ga.
I would like to see a pass-fail 
system on this campus and I 
would like to see a commuter 
handbook published. I am inter
ested in hearing your opinions 
on these and any other sub
jects. I may be contacted through 
Box 100, Campus Mail, or at my

Page 6 - THE TARTAN - Wednesday, April 3, 1968Rationale for Co-Ed Dorm Situation on CMl CampusAttorney Herbert Porter Says: SHUT IP
by Herbert H. Porter, Attorney at Lawby Don Baer
I feel that to be a great aca
demic community several things 
are needed. First buildings are 
needed so that people will have 
some place to meet. CMU has 
a very strong faculty and has its 
selection of some of the best 
students in the country. Car
negie has all the drawings of 
greatness; it has large research 
lalbs, it has a very fine Fine 
Arts department, and it is lo
cated in a well-known cultural
community. What then is keep
ing us from becoming tall that 
we could and should be?
Arthur Checkering seems to 
come close describing our prob
lem in an article in Educational 
Record. In talking about college 
residences he strikes the very 
heart of our problem. The prob
lem is not easy to describe but 
its very well. "When an institu
tion is small and its resources 
are limited, when students, 
faculty, and administration 
alike are making do with less 
than ideal or adequate facil
ities, there is often a strong 
sense of community. Staff mem
bers serve in several capacities, 
working with students in varing contexts. The students tal
ents and energies are genuinely 
needed.
The total college community 
is an effective culture for its 
members. But as the institution 
becomes more secure, as the 
roles of faculty and administra
tion become more specialized, 
as students are less needed, then 
the sense of community is 
sharply diminished and it no 
longer serves as a reference 
group. Dorms become more dif
fuse, behaviors range more 
widely, individual invisibility in
creases, and the totality of a 
student or faculty member is 
hard to s.Te.
One frequent result is that 
students have no general refer
ence group. Consequently, they 
feel that to hold responsible 
positions in campus organiza
tions has little significance, and 
the potentialities for develop
ment that reside in such activi
ties are attenuated. These acti
vities become artifician and su
perficial, remote from the lives 
of most students. Students grow 
more distant from each other 
and from the faculty and admin
istration.
Differences which arise tend 
to move toward polarization and 
solidification rather than toward 
resolution and accommodation. 
Attempts to establish standards 
for behavior which have force 
for students and with which 
they identitfy are less and less 
successful.
Then there occurs one, or a 
mixture of three situations: (1) 
Rules wither gradually away, 
or (2) rules are maintained, but 
they are to be winked at as long 
as one is sufficiently discreet so 
that the eyes do not have to be 
held shut or averted too long, 
or (3) more and more feverish 
attempts are made to enforce 
rules by adding student assist
ants to the assistants to the 
Deans of Men and Women, and 
undeclared guerrilla warfare 
commences. Chickering adds 
that one response to these gen
eral institutional changes is to 
creat housing arrangements 
that permit each living unit to 
become a reference group for 
its members.
At this point two questions 
can be asked. De we really have 
this problem? What would the 
recommended housing arrange
ments be? Well, we do have the 
problem. Students and faculty
have very few relations outside 
the classroom. The student body 
is going in many different di
rections and they do not com
municate and therefore can not 
learn from one another.
This school has a great poten
tial for mixing competent peo
ple in many fields. This poten
tial must be developed: Student 
Government was just subjected 
to a referendum because it has 
become artificial and superfi
cial, and remote from the stu
dents. In our dorms the coun
selors are instructed to turn 
their heads away as long as 
whatever a student is doing 
does not greatly bother some
one else. We have every one of 
the problems that Chickering 
talks about.
How then would we change 
our housing arrangements to 
combat the problem, and why 
is housing the basis of this prob
lem? An article in University 
Quarterly says American 
Studies have shown that living 
arrangements can have a pow
erful influence, for good or ill, 
upon students personal and in
tellectual development. The ar
ticle also points out that The 
scientist and the technologist, 
who are perhaps most in need 
of the liberalization of outlook 
that residence is claimed to pro
vide are the least likely to be 
provided with such accommoda
tions. (It should be noted that 
when residences are refered to 
as above they are talking of a 
living center, a place where peo
ple can get to know others. This 
includes co-ed dinning, coned rec
reation, lounges, class rooms, 
libraries and faculty all closely 
related and in easy access of 
the students.)
Many universities have rec
ognized that living quartefs 
must be more than a place to 
study and sleep. Almost all of 
the new dorms built at MSU, 
KSU, OSU, UM, Boston C. and 
Ohio U. are of the residential 
variety. We can easily see that 
housing condidtions such as we 
have here have been considered 
unacceptable at institutions not 
nearly as well-known as CMU. 
There must be something to the 
idea that housing arrangements' 
are important.
Many people suggest that the 
ideal housing set up for college 
would be an Academic Latin 
Quarter ... a dense urban area, 
informal setup, a network of 
interlocking teaching rooms, 
coffee bars, labs, restaurants, 
libraries, study bedrooms, thea
ters, and shops. A street mar
ket of ideas. Students and fac
ulty could live together in such 
an informal comfortable place. 
Such a set up would be like 
building a Disneyland. Other 
schools have found it conven
ient to build dorm classroom 
complexes. These setups house 
faculty offices, good recreation 
facilities, co-ed dining and in 
generaJl an informal mixing of 
sexes, faculty, and discussion. 
LeRoy Olson, reporting on an 
experimental coed dorm set up 
at MSU, gives these reactions.
As a result of co-ed recrea
tion, dinting set-ups and close 
but separate living wings there 
was an improvement of dress, 
manners, and behavior of stu
dents. Holding classes in the 
dorms increased both the qual
ity and quantity of discussion. 
Faculty members liked the 
more normal relaxed atmos
phere, and the meliorating ef
fect of the coed living arrange
ments on students behavior. We 
can see that such living ar
rangements would go a long
Architectural Panel 
Discusses Problems
The student AIA met last Fri
day with a panel or architectural 
faculty members, including Mr. 
Paul Schweikherm head of the 
department. It was the aim of 
the AIA to open a channel of 
communication between faculty 
and students, in hope of develop
ing a better department.
The meeting began with the 
reading of a statement by the 
students which consisted of re
actions to the present teaching 
system and suggestions for im
proving it. Since study is being 
done on the proposed six-year 
architectural program, the 
statement suggested a complete 
rvaluation of the curriculum. 
A major complaint was the lack 
of emphasis on the social sci
ences, though, as a designer, the 
architect plans his programs 
around men and his environ
ment. A proposed curriculum 
consisted of two years of basic 
academic subjects in addition to 
a foundation course in design. 
After the second year, the pro
gram would emphasize the develpment of an individual des
ign process. The student would 
have a chance to develop pro
grams at particular interest to 
him with students and faculty 
members with the same inter
ests.
Besides considerations of cur
riculum, the AIA proposed for
mation of two organizations, a 
cumulative research - reference 
library and an Architectural Re
search Institute, to provide 
means of gathering and storing 
information pertaining to speci
fic architectural problems or to 
the general field.
After the reading of this 
statement, the meeting was 
opened to questions directed at 
the panel of faculty. Great con
cern was shown by all students 
about the continuing loss of 
good design professors to other 
institutions. The panel was ask
ed about why, how, and what 
was being done about this loss, 
but gave no satisfactory 
answer.
The immediate result of the 
symposium was an agreement 
for the formation of a student 
committee to discuss these mat
ters with the faculty.
way toward solving the prob
lems that we have at CMU. We 
stiill would have the problem of 
over throwing the reluctance 
of many staff members to in
volve themselves in the lives of 
students but offices in the 
dorms and increased contact 
oculd help in this area.
We must now apply these 
ideas to the CMU campus. The 
living set-up is bad. There are 
future plans to build dorm com
plexes. These, however, do not 
involve me as a student. I will 
be long gone when ten years 
from now Carnegie begins to 
make some sort of transition. 
We must do something now to 
change the situation. In a now 
classic study of the roll that 
environment plays in higher 
education Stern came up with 
these conclusions about good 
schools.
Institutions with favorable 
intellectual climates had and
As a trial lawyer I have had 
many, many times to give ad
vice to people in trouble, quite 
often not of their own making. 
I am forced to say again that 
much of the trouble, many of 
the difficulties in the criminal 
court are caused not by what 
people do but by what they say. 
In other words, my greatest ad
vice to you and to every one 
of you is: Shut Up!
I could say it more nicely, I 
could say it more complicatedly, I could dress it up. But noth
ing whatsoever is as important 
to tell you as Shut Up!
When one is faced with police 
interrogation or with people who 
will carry ones words back to 
the police or the prosecution, 
one has to remember that the 
danger of ones statements lies 
not only in what you say di
rectly but in what can be im
plied or built upon what you 
say.
If you are with some people, 
for example, who are accused 
of having marijuana and you 
say, Thats not my grass, you 
have admitted in effect two of 
the elements necessary to prove 
a felony conviction for posses
sion of marijuana  you have 
admitted knowledge that it is 
a narcotic and you have admit
ted knowledge of its presence.
If you are in a place in which 
a marijuana bust is made and 
somebody says, Is this coat in 
the closet yours? And you 
say, Yes, that one word may 
have talked you into a con
viction of Section 11530 of the 
Health and Safety Code, Pos
session of Marijuana, or some 
other and probably worse sec
tion of the law. Even if you are 
wearing a shirt or jacket, it is 
often a terrible mistake to ad
mit that it is yours even though 
it seems obvious.
The trouble is, those who do 
not have criminal minds and 
criminal intent have a naive 
thought that since they have 
done nothing wrong, there is 
nothing wrong with saying so. 
This is as foolish as can be. 
This supposes that only those 
who are guilty of crime as de
fined in the mind of this speak
ing person are going to be 
charged with crime. Thats not 
the case.
In the first place, many times 
the police will arrest and the 
district attorney will file a com
plaint for possession of one joint 
of marijuana. I iiave seen a
used greater resources in pur
suing objectives of learning and 
scholarship. Students in such 
institutions were more capable 
and perhaps contributed more 
than the faculty to high institu
tional productivity, which in 
turn attracted other highly 
able and motivated students. 
The climate was likely to be 
one in which students express
ed themselves with support and 
encouragement of the faculty. 
At Carnegie, students do not 
have enough contact with facul
ty to be encouraged by them 
others to do their homework. 
Students are not considered im
portant and do not contribute 
to institutional productivity. 
Carnegie does not have two 
of the three basic components 
of a favorable intellectual cli
mate. I would like to suggest 
that this is because it does not 
use its greater resources to 
their best advantage. To use an
number of defendants accused 
of only one roach between them. 
Obviously they dont all own 
that roach and yet there have 
been convictions obtained. Peo
ple are spending time behind 
bars because of this.
Start to think self-protectively, if not defensively. Start to 
give the attorney who may rep
resent you in a criminal case, 
a case which you never ima
gined you were going to become 
involved in, a chance to do a 
good job for you by not opening 
your mouth and dropping out 
of it the key to a jail cell.
The instruction on being si
lent goes even to such things 
as whose apartment one is in, 
whose clothing or shoes are 
these in front of youall such 
innocent seeming things as that 
even though the answer to 
the question may seem obvious. 
The answer quite often is not 
obvious in court except for the 
foolish admissions you may have 
made. So dont make them.
Another major aspect of be
ing silent is the fact that once 
you have uttered a few words, 
you may not find those words 
turning up in court and on a 
police report in just the form 
in which you had uttered them. 
The person who possesses the 
belief that every police officer 
reports the words a person ut
ters exactly as he said it, is 
naive beyond belief. This sup
poses several things, none of 
which you have a right to de
pend on.
First it supposes that the po
lice officer has a perfect me
mory under the stress of the 
moment, that he is as compe
tent as a machine to remember 
what you said and\ later, many 
times hours or days later, set 
this down accurately.
Secondly, it supposes that a 
police officer involved in an ar
rest and in proving that he is 
right in making the arrest is 
dispassionate about what he 
hears in the course of an in
vestigation.
I am not referring to an of
ficer telling an untruth (at this 
point); I am merely saying that 
most of us in the course of our 
lives hear things and see things 
as we want to hear them and 
see them; and we develop a be
lief that is how it actually oc
curred. Things are sifted 
through a specialized strainer 
in our minds and what is reednsays,So ns :tha mtiSj
idea from a Tartan editorial, 
we cannot be a first class insti
tution with eighth class housing 
that is used in a 21st class man
ner. We need to do more with 
what we have and to plan for 
the future.
(This is a statement of my 
views not supported by research 
do to lack of time)
The reaction of someone read
ing this paper as it has been 
presented so far could be as 
follows. We see the problem 
and will work to solve it in the 
future, but we cannot see 
changing our present system do 
to cost and the fact that it will 
not completely solve the prob
lem.
I think that this argument 
would be valid if the present 
system could just be better and 
was not doing any harm. I 
think that the present system

HILARY P. ZUBRITZKY
Members of the 
Student Government :
It is a great pleasure for me to 
be nominated as a candidate for 
commuter representative to the 
Executive Council. Although I 
was not able to deliver this speech 
personally, I still hope that you 
will find my goals worthy of be
ing elected.
Commuters are too often view
ed as the lost members of the 
Carnegie - Mellon student body. 
Too many fellow students think 
of the commuter as one who is 
more interested in catching bus
es than in participating in on cam
puses activities. The administra
tion continually focuses its atten
tion on the affairs which regard 
dormitory residents. But what 
about the commuter; isn't he or 
she as much as a full-fledged stu
dent as the resident?
In my opinion, the commuters 
are ofen better reprensentatives 
of the CMU student body than 
the dorm residents.
My main goal, if elected, is to 
provide recognition for the com
muter.
Are the Commuter Rooms in 
Skibo adequate for the many offcampus residents? Not in my 
opinion! We need more lounges, 
with better facilities  possibly 
with a television or radio. More 
vending machines i n buildings 
other than Skibo or the droms.
We need a commuter bulletin 
board, so we commuters can find 
out about thins before they hap
pen  about meetings, special 
events, and about things which 
are significant ot the commuter.
Above all  the commuter must 
find recognition by the adminis
tration and the faculty! We need 
more consideration when special 
events are planned, particularly 
in regard to time  such as re
quired films which are shown at 
times convenient for residents, 
but most inconvenient for com
muters. This sa ue thing applies 
to assignments which are rela
tively impossible to fulfill with
out giving up several lunch per
iods.
In this same respect the admin
istration and faculty must learn 
that the commuter can spend only 
a limited time on campus and 
does not have free hours to waste 
waiting between classes or to 
be coming to school for only one 
class a day; therefore, commuters 
should be given special consider
ation when scheduling classes.
These are only the most basic 
of my proposals and aims, and I 
am not certain that I will be able 
to accomplish them all in one 
term of office, if I am elected. 
But I am certain, that if I receive 
my position as Commuter Repre
sentative of the Executive Coun
cil, I will provide thd initiative 
to start these proposals well on 
the road ot eventual realization.
It was a priviledge to have this 
opportunity to air my basic platfrom. Thank you!
TONI SAPET
I believe that the seven soror
ities should be represented in Stu
dent Government in such a way 
as to make explicit their coopera
tion. and participation in worth
while activities. This is impera
tive if they are to be recognized 
for their true value to the cam
pus and if they are to given con
sideration in the policies of the 
administration and the strdent 
body.

NEW COLLEGE
ednsays,So Hgnz mtiS 1)
The new college is coming 
off the drawing board this spring 
and will offer students an oppor
tunity to decide what should be 
included in their college. Besides 
the committees for the metacur
riculum. there is a faculty-student committee that has just be
gun designing the freshman psy
chology-type course to be tried 
experimentally this fall.
A group i s being formed t o 
write a student cultural handbook 
for freshmen next fall. It will at
tempt to draw on the knowledge 
of anyone who has discovered uni
que. interesting things about Pitts
burgh and work toward a realis
tic picture of what is. It will be 
written for students, by students 
independently of administrative 
image-making.
This year existing departments
are beginning to reevaluate their 
courses and major offerings. Now 
is the time for students to organ
ize and insist on being part of 
the planning. Students in the His
tory Department have formed a 
club with the joint purpose of 
bringing history majors together 
to socialize and intellectualize 
and also to serve as a fulcrum for 
student demands within thd de
partment. This is the ideal oppor
tunity for student pressure to be 
appled. Administrators are in the 
process of rvaluation and are 
more amenable to suggestion. 
Changes should include the ideas 
of students, but students can only 
be included if they demand to 
be.

Windowless Buildings- Educational Bonus

Food Service Committee Takes Action
A presidential fact-finding com
mission has recommended that all 
buildings on the Carnegie-Mellon 
campus be constructed without 
windows.
Thd buildings they propose 
would combine the architectural 
advances of the stone age with 
the political mutterings of admin
istrative stoneheads. Sources close 
to the commissionss underground 
office hurled these reasons:
............Air pollution could be
controlled, since stone is a bet
ter filter of air than glass is.
.... The universitys heating 
bill would be reduced, since stone 
retains heat longer than glass 
does. The furnaces, therefore 
could be turned off even more 
frequently than this past winter.
Matt Hunter, commission chair
man who is special assistant to 
Roy R. Schubert, further explain
ed:
"It takes about a day and a half 
to clean all the windows of Ski
bo. Then what do we got? We got 
clean windows.
But clean windows destroy the 
concept of the college education, 
which protects our children from 
seeing the real wvrld.
With proper fenestration, stu
dents would have been able to see 
copies of The Student as Nigger, 
which administrators would not 
allow to be printed on campus.
With proper fenestration, girls 
might have been tempted to vio
late rules that forbid them from 
watching water fights.
To supplement the commis
sion's findings, administration 
sources said, windows will be nei
ther washed nor repaired. Scobel 
Hall is expected to become the 
first campus building without 
windows. Its remainding window 
is slowly returning to sand.

Prompted by the recent com
plaints caused by a recent mis
hap in the Skibo kitchen, the 
Food Service Committee has draf
ted a list of changes in Food Ser
vice policy. In the preface to the 
announcement, the committee 
mentioned that the kitchen work
ers were highly discontented with 
the unsafe conditions surrounding 
their work areas, including sharp 
implements, hot ( supposedly) 
ovens, and even (if rumor is cor
rect) a supervisor. There was an 
undercurrent among the non-stu
dent employees carrying talk of 
unionizing and striking, a move 
which could involve the vital 
Green Man forces and which 
would obviously cripple the 
school, forcing it to close until 
a settlement could be reached. 
There were also numerous out
cries from the students who had 
fallen victim to unfortunate side 
effects of the accident, but as 
students d^e merely captive cus
tomers with no power to disrupt 
the happy routine of the institu
tion, their comments were prud
ently shelved, freeing the adminis
trators to cope with the real is
sues.

New safety procedures for the 
kitchen have been formulated 
with the help of the A.I.Ch.E. 
specializing in the handling of 
corrosive and poisonous materials. 
Workers will all be issued pro
tective coverals impervious to all 
known acids, and gas masks . The 
group projects that this should 
virtually eliminate casualties in 
the soup - and - gravy area, and 
should substantially reduce fatal
ities reported on corned - beef - 
and - cabbage (and similar fare) 
days. Cybernetic arms similar to 
those developed for the nation's 
atomic laboratories will be instal
led for handling mystery meat 
specials, alleviating the dread 
Mystery Meat Syndrome. All pip
ing in the kitchen will be replac
ed by Pyrex with stainless steel 
fittings, suitable for processing 
Super Soup and Skibo coffee, the 
most powerful solvents known to 
man. The bakery is being outfit
ted by a former advisor to steel 
warehouses nativnally known for 
systems to handle dangerously 
heavy materials. The crew is ex
pected to be satisfied with these 
precautions but may still petition 
for hazardous duty pay clause.
But the Food Service Commit
tee would not dream of neglec
ting the student, despite the stu
dents decidedly inferior bargain
ing position. They have made sev
eral major changes in the Mens 
food contract service with the pro
vision of extending then to Morewood cafeteria if they are suc
cessful. The most striking feature 
is optional liability insurance. 
Written jointly with the regular 
student health policy, it provides 
full payment for any maladies con
tracted directly from Skibo food 
eaten in the contract line Sat
urday or Sunday, and payment 
up to $2.50 for hospital care as
sociated with poisoning from re
gular weekly fare. There will also 
be special inspection tours of the 
ktichen open to all contract hold
ers. (Supposedly any student who 
can make this tour without blowing 
lunch will be given a free sem
esters meals. In the trial tours 
there were no students able or 
willing to take advantage of this 
offer.) These will, of course, nec
essitate raising food prices, but 
the committee expressed confi
dence that the students would be 
more than happy to pay more for 
such vital appurtenances.
After hearing the announced 
policy of the committee, your re
porter asked when the quality of 
the food would be upgraded and 
portions increased, if hours could 
be extended, if service procedure 
could be made more efficient to 
reduce waiting time, and if the 
place could be kept a wee bit 
cleaner and less unappetizing. 
Caught off guard, their spokes,am fumfered that the committee 
was unaware that these were valid 
issues, and that in any case, they 
would have to wait until the press
ing questions were suitably resol
ved.

SKY DIVING: Final Play-offs
A new IM sport at CMU fin
ished its first successful season 
last week when the Dorm Nerds 
defeated KS in the play-offs. In
sky of the Nerds was high scorer 
for the team, making two perfect 
landings within the 30 foot dia
meter target circle. Diddling of 
KS was responsible for his teams 
only point. On pulling his rip
cord, Diddling became entangl
ed in his shroulp lines and freefell to the ground from 4,000 feet. 
However, because one of his 
pieces ended up within the target 
circle his team was credited with 
a point, but he received a zero for 
form. (Last rites will be conduct
ed by the Office of Religious Af
fairs in Room 39, Skibo, on Thurs
day. Flowers are welcome.)
DU tied with the Computer 
Grubs for third place. Recovery 
teams are dragging the Allegeny

was blown off course. Neverthe
less, the Grubs were able to score 
two points to tie with DU.

In the post-season Bagel-Bowl 
a fired up CMU football squad

North - Western South Dakota 
School of Cosmotology. The an
nual classic was played in blind
ing sleet before a capacity crowd 
of 14 at North-Westerns Millard 
Filmore Memorial Stadium in 
Greased Elbow. S. D.
Thd Tartan eleven was led of
fensively by the dazzling arm of 
Senior Tom "The Falcon Humpra and the sloppery fingers of 
Dickie Smell. On defense the Tar
tans were hurt by the lose of 
Barry Zetto who was accidentally 
electrocuted last week while recieving hydro-therapy for a frac
tured blivet in CMUs circa 1908 
whirlpool.
Because of weather, it was im
possible to determine the exact 
sequence of events that led to CMUs defeat. However, it is rum
ored that the referees, two Blackfeet Indians from the Bad River 
Indian Reservation got lost in the 
sleet and were actually reffing 
a high school soccer match in 
neighboring Dry Gultch. Taking 
advantage of the resulting lack of 
supervision. The North-Western 
Hair - Culers engaged in a free

able to physically decimate the

4:00 p.m. 
If the Surf's up!
More over, there was some 
question as to the exact position 
of the goal lines, and. despite ex
cellent blocking by the front line. 
Tartan quarter - back Humpr was 
consistently nailed for losses be
hind his own goal.
It is known for certain, that 
the Curlers were able to score 
one TD early in the fourth quar
ter when a Tartan pass aimed at 
Mad Dog Zap was deflected by 
a Northwestern Cheerleader and 
picked off by Dubinsky who car
ried it in for six. No one saw 
the attempt for the extra point 
but the scorer decided to call it 
good, anyway.
None of CMUs eighteen man 
coaching staff was able to explain 
the humiliating defeat. One assis
tant half - back coach speculat
ed that the loss was due to some
ones misplacing the 1480 used 
Saint Patricks Day picnic posters 
which contain the Tartan plays. 
When questioned by this reporter, 
head coach Sasparella, former 
ball - boy for the Pittsburgh Steelers, mumbled incoherently about 
a new secret play which hadnt 
worked as expected. However 
most of the coaches werent avail
able for interview following the 
game, since theyd left for home 
early in the third quarter.
Thd half-time score was some
where between 54 and 61 to noth
ing. and it was a demoralized Tar
tan team that waded back to 
the dressing room. Head Coach 
Sasparella launched into a eight 
second tirade against the incompetance shown by his team in 
the first half and his assistants 
circulated among the players 
with additional secret plays. Sasparellas half - time pep talk, 
which some players felt was re
miniscent of Pat ORrians pole
mics in Knute Rockne of Notre 
Dame, was evidently respon
sible for CMUs comeback in the 
second half. There are those who 
claim that CMUs Batinski didnt 
score on a brilliant end - run 
through the middle of the North 
Western line in the late third
quarter. Since there were no ref
erees to decide on the play, a 
compromise was worked out be
tween the respective coaches and 
CMU was credited with 3 points. 
The remainder of the game was 
no contest as the Curlers swept 
through the tattered Tartan defen
ces for touchdown after touch
down.
Bagel - Bowl has long been fam
ous as being the last big bowl 
game of the season. CVS report
edly offered $250,000 for coverage; 
rights this year but decided at 
the last minute to cancel cov
erage when it was discovered that 
Alpo Dogfood was the only spon
sor willing to come up with $8 
thou for a ten second spot. WRCT had orginallv contracted to 
cover the contest, but the WRCT 
sports action team, taking advan
tage of a donated Hertz rent -a - 
car. decided to spend the week
end in Reno instead.
The unusually large crowd at 
the game was credited to the re
cent addition of folding charis for 
seating purposes at Filmore Sta
dium, a former horse pasture.
Next week, the Tartans begin 
spring practuce on the home field 
The most exciting feature of the 
season will be the appearance on 
the field of thd CMU training 
staff which has just returned from 
an eight day stand at the South 
McKeesport Lions Club.
Housing Office To 
Rectify Situation
The Housing Office, in answer 
to an editorial printed in the Tar
tan las week concerning rats in 
the dormitories, has hired what 
it considers to be . . . The great
est experts in the field of vermin 
control. according to George 
Tipker. head of housing. Two 
men. Dr. Stranger, a bagpiper 
from Hamelin. Pa., and a Mr. Pat
rick. from Ireland, known to his 
friends as The Saint. have con 
tracted to rid the dormitories of 
rats and other pests. The men have 
been hired on a three week trial 
period.
When questioned concerning 
their methods of operation, both 
replied that they used time hon
ored methods which could be car
ried out with the dormitories still 
occupied.
Thd Bagpiper of Hamelin told 
us that he plans to play his bag
pipes, . . . and Ill make such a 
racked! Oy! Will those rats wish 
they had stayed in Egypt. The 
Tartan agreed with Dr. Stranger, 
as the sounds of bagpipes have 
driven residents from the dorms 
on many occasions.
We then inquired as to what 
Dr. Stranger planned to do with 
the rats once he drove them out 
of the dormitories.
"Well. he replied. I thought 
that was going to be a problem. 
But I've surveyed the area and 
I am firmly convinced that the 
potholes in the parking lots and 
streets of the surrounding area 
are more than sufficidnt to hold 
all the rats. 
Mr. Patricks plans struck us 
as being rather far fetched. First 
I take this stick." he said, show
ing us a large pole, and then I 
pound the ground with it very 
hard If the ground is moist, this
generates steam, which attracts 
the steambugs'  cockroaches to 
you  and the steambugs are then 
sent to their rewards by being 
forced to listen to Dean Swank 
describing his latest batch of cin
namon rolls. '
When asked how he plans to 
make certain that the ground is 
moist, he replied. "I'm going to 
wait until Wednesday night. I fig
ure that the dorm residents will 
generate more than enough tears 
after reading the Tartan.
After trial runs to be conduct
ed in the area of the Skibo kitch
en. the pair will move to the dor
mitories. where they will begin 
their work in earnest.

manship with excellent perform
ances in a sharp statement 
about life today. Although the 
ending is a somewhat lax man
ner the unified spirit wins out. 
Wa99w N ItJfw is also a possi
ble winner but its aiims and 
range was not as daring but 
its overall consistency and form 
exceeded Mnw usefxedwl Tahdas 
Taatddtw onaxtf9Ed even be in

Iay9p da T99ws and r9 dnw

ing some good performances are 
not even near the first two 
flicks in artistic integrity and 
intention.

LMnw usefxedw  Mike Nich
ols. This year marks Richard 
Brooks becoming more and more 
like an American auteur. His 
craft and technique has im
proved to the point of making 
r9 Iatf Wtaaf a landmark in 
American film. Nichols work in 
Mnw usefxedw has shown influ
ences from inumerable direc
tors, tout he has blended these 
influences into a meaningful, 
dazzling style. DirectoriaUy Wa9:
nie & ItJfw (Arthur Penn) is 
stylized, theatrical job with a 
V beautiful ow9ow of pace, polish 
and period atmosphere. In retro
spect the film says relatively 
less about today, and though 
one is caught up in the momen
tum of the film, Penn has made 
the film a romantic folk ballad 
rather than truly and fully ex
ploring the motives that made 
Wa99w N ItJfw kill all those 
folks.
Norman Jewison, is technical
ly, a proficient television direc
tor who has given r9 dnw cwed 
of dnw Rpnd the punch and feel
ing of a television special. The 
picture is an improvement over 
Mnw Fxooe9o Are Iay9p but 
his films still lack a definite 
viewpoint. Kramers work on 
uxwoo 'naEo Iay9p da T99ws 
[ is Cautious, faintly odd fashion
ed and traditional in terms of 
his own work. There are many 
scenes which lack control and 
come off absurdly unfunny and 
amatuerishly slapstick.
BEST ACTOR  (Nominees: 
Warren Beatty, Wa99w N ItJfwG

Paul Newman, Iaat ce9f ^xbwG

* Dustin Hoffman should win 
for his remarkable portrayal of 
Benjamin in a remarkable film 
debut. Hoffman managed a be
lievable confusion and yet em
ployed some basic actor's 
nuances with great subtlety and 
meaning. idwpws will probably

timental meDasdw ye9fJ fxw da 
nw tao9p da ^ww HesD9 in S.AA 
(Ca* Ballou). Twozdw a bad
screenplay, Steiger and Poitier 
caused the film to rise above a 
pedestrian level.
Paul Newman has reached his 
peak in this successive develop
ment of a deadpan, cool char
acter which is, increasingly, tak
ing over for what made Marlon 
Brando. Warren Beatty has turn
ed in his best work to date in 
Wa99w & Clyde by suggesting 
Clyde Barrow with a shocking 
believability. Spencer Tracy 
gives his usual safe perform
ance in his last film. Kramer 
has, aptly, provided him with 
the traditional end of the film 
monologue which makes us em
pathize and appreciate his film 
work that much more.
SUPPORTING ACTOR _ 
(Nominees: John Cassavetes, 
TsdJ Ta-w9G Gene Hackman, 
Wa99w N ItJfwG Cecil Kellaway, 
uxwoo 'naEo Iay9p da T99wsG 
George Kennedy, TsdJ Ta-w9lj
*Michael J. Pollard, though 
Gene Hackman is excellent, has 
a larger assignment and makes 
more of his special brand of ver
satility. John Cassavetes gives a 
good, but limited performance. 
Cecil Kellaway was delightful in 
uxwoo 'naEo Iay9p da T99wsl 
Kellaway has made his reputa
tion playing witty Irish priests 
and this is no exception but the 
performance, though solid, is 
not of Oscar caliber.
BEST ACTRESS  (Nomi

ItJfwG Edith Evans, Mnw 'noz:
wswsoG Audrey Hepburn, 'ed 
C9dt TesbG Katharine Hepburn, 
uxwoo 'na Iay9p da T99wslj
* Edith Evans is a sure winner 
for giving what very well may 
be the finest performance ever 
recorded on screen by an ac
tress. Nothing more can be said 
about her performance in immatchable genius. Anne Ban
croft gave, in Mnw usefxedw, her 
most convincing, restrained and 
unmannered performance ever. 
She made Mrs. Robinson trag
ically sad yet understanding^ 
evil. She handled the humor and 
the drama in the script beauti
fully. Faye Dunaway was far 
from extraordinary and a bit 
too slick for Bonnie Parker. 
She was, however, a good asset 
to the film but failed to give an 
Academy Award performance.
Audrey Hepburn gave an un
expectedly good portrayal in 
'ed C9dt Tesb though it is 
questionable how valid her nom
ination is. It is ironic that Kath
arine Hepburn is once again up 
against Anne Bancroft who, un
deservedly, won some years ago 
for Mnw Hsehtw 'asbwsl Kath
arine Hepburn should have re
ceived the award for her magnicent Mary Tyrone in ^a9p TeJEo

* Estelle Parsons noses ou t all 
competition except for possibly 
Katharine Ross. Miss Parsons 
made specific character choices 
and executed them brilliantly. 
She handled the adjustments 
within the character beautiful
ly; from shrieking terror to the 
exhausting lethargy in the hos

You could call it theater-inthe-round. Or high, wide and 
handy.
The four main characters  
technical production majors in 
Carnegie - Mellon Universitys 
drama departmentWill literal
ly be up in the air.
But they will be building, not 
acting, on the pedestrian bridge 
over the Blvd. of the Allies in 
Gateway Center.
The Show starts May 20 
when Len Alexander, Miles Fischel. Tom Mendenhall and Don 
Earl begin creating their total 
environment for the Three Riv
ers Arts Festival which opens 
May 30 and runs through June 9.
Their steel and plastic up
dated medieval maze received 
top billing in the contest spon
sored by the Festival and judged 
by Thomas Messer, director of 
the Solomon R. Gugenheim 
Museum in New York.
High Panels Erected
The first prize money is what
ever is left out of the $5,000 af
acting ability. Beah Richards un
derplayed, as usual, in uxwoo 
'naEo Ia99p da T99ws and 
has developed a safe type of 
character which she has been 
using since her legitimate role 
in James Baldwins Mnw Vyw9 
Ias9ws years ago. Mildred Nat
wick recreated her Broadway 
role well and did a competent 
job but her performance is noth
ing special. Carol Channing isnt 
worth mentioning for Mnasaxpn:

SCREENPLAYBASED UP
ON MATERIAL ANOTHER 
MEDIUM  (Nominees: Donn 
Pearce and Frank R. Pierson

Mnw usefxedw, Richard Brooks 
for r9 Iatf Wtaaf, Stirling Stilliphant for r9 dnw cwed am dnw 
Rpnd, Joseph Strick and Fred 
Haines for CtJoowolj
Lr9 Iatf Wtaaf was without a 
doubt the most faithful to the 
book. Brooks never once made 
the screen play pretentious and 
didnt exploit the novel with 
cheap cinematic devices. Ulysses 
is a reverent handling of the 
plot but is not on the imaginitive level of Joyces work. Nich
ols has creatively found the 
humorous aspect of the book 
but in the cinematic process has 
lessened Benjamins (i.e. the 
novels) point of view.

Burnett Guffey provided the 
most imaginitive photography 
last year for Wa99w N ItJfwl 
He combined a sensitive lyricism 
and tremendous sense of en
vironment. r9 Iatf Wtaaf and 
Mnw usefxedw are the only other 
films which approach Guffeys 
creativity.
Those individuals who failed 
to get a much deserved nomin

ter the cost of erecting the mul
ti-colored panels, some of which 
will be 12 feet high, supported 
by steel rods.
The project will start with 
the blessing of the Citys Bureau 
of Building Inspection, which re
quired several sets of engineer
ing drawings before it issued a 
permit.
This was granted after bu
reau engineers were satisfied 
with structural calculations on 
the strength and stability of the 
mazes vertical members against 
possible wind load.
They considered other little 
things like proper egress 
points (escape routes) plus the 
fact that the maze is simple 
enough that you couldnt get 
stuck in it, as a festival spokes
man put it.
The bureau went a step fur
ther and suggested a five-foot 
wide walkway on either side 
(for persons Who respect the to
tal involvement of walking 
through).
Faamtwoo idsxhdxsw
The roofless structure will be 
made of transparent, translu
cent and opaque panels farm
ing what the creators call the 
concept of festival itself, styliz
ing a gallery of paintings with 
an endless pattern of paintings 
arranged along its twisting 
walkways.
The environment was chosen 
out of about 30 entries in a con
test described in a triumph of 
non-statements by the festival 
people, who said they didnt 
want to limit creativity by giv
ing the environment a more 
specific name.
The written pLans, scale draw
ings, sketches, supplementary 
descriptions and optional scale 
models were sifted by Mr. Mes
ser, who said it was not cour
age, but folly which led him 
to attempt the task of judg
ing a total environment for a 
bridge.
Early one cold Thursday morn
ing Mr. Messer took a look at 
the environment-less bridge. In 
a rather conservative statement 
at the end of the day, he said:
Anyone who undertakes to 
create an environment on a 
bridge  not to be interrupted 
as a pedestrian thruway and 
happening in the midst of traf
fic  is bound to use a great 
deal of ingenuity.
Mr. Messer elaborated: Many 
approached the problem with 
skill and imagination. As to ma
terialseverything in the book! 
This is characteristic of the 
modern shapers. Sometimes 
what was attempted didnt seem 
worth attempting. Some proj
ects outstripped the occasion. 
They were too much. Some I 
thought were impossible.

Second place winners were 
Bruce B. Dexter and David M. 
Garber, students in the school 
of architecture at CMU, who 
won $300.
Third place and $200 went to 
George Nocito, head of the art 
department at West Virginia 
University, and his co-workers, 
Joe Moss (whose kinetics sculp

the Arts and Craft Center) and 
Wendell McPherson.
The first place winners (prob

A special feature of the The
ater Environment and Architec
ture Symposium to be held this 
Friday. April 5. at 11:30 am in 
the College of Fine Arts Theater 
will be A Re-evaluation of Ameri
ca's Aesthetic Values in Terms of 
Architecture" by guest lecturer 
Jo Mielziner. Broadway design
er and theater consultant.
Mr. Mielziner believes that we 
live in a climate of excessive ma
terialism, and that although 20th 
Century America has achieved 
wonders in efficiency, it has done 
so only in a very limited way. 
He feels that we have reflected 
a great deal on how man works 
on what his bodily needs are, but 
little on what mans spiritual 
needs demand. His wish is that 
our efficiency experts ^pend less 
time and money on Man the 
Machine and free examine 
man the Spirit. His lecture at 
the Symposium will include this 
aesthetic aspect of the theater ar
chitects work as well as its prac
tical application in meeting the 
varied physical demands of the 
different performing arts.
Mr. Mielziner has himself work
ed on several architectural proj
ects as consulting or collaborat
ing desinger. He was co-designer 
with the late Eero Saarinen of the 
Vivian Beaumont Theater of Lin
coln Center and special consul
tant to Welton Becket on the de
sign of the Froum Theater at the 
Los Angeles Music Center. With 
Kevin Roche  Joghn Binkeloo 
Associate, he is co-designer of the 
new University of Michigan The
ater in Ann Arbor, and with Ed
ward Barnes he is co-desinger of 
A Lyric Theater for Initimate Mu
sical Drama, one of the Ideal The
aters commissioned by the Ford 
Fohndation in 1960.
The Theater Environment and 
Architecture Symposium is open 
to all interested students and fac
ulty of Carneige-Mellon Univer
sity.

in creative wirting next year are

The American Choiee
Thd U. S. is strengthening its 
position in Vietnam in such a 
constant fashion that this opera
tion seems to be the whole of its 
Asian policy. This, however, is 
misleading: The U. S. is not in 
Asia because of Vietnam. It is in 
Vietnam because of the whole of 
its Asiatic policy, which esisted 
long before this conflict. The lo
cal war of peace perspectives of 
the Vietnam conflict are of course 
important, but of much less im
portant than the factors which 
have determined the American 
choice.
America has looked eagerly to
wards the Pacific since its black 
vessals opened Japan to the Wes
tern world in 1854. The A uericans entered WW II only after 
Peral Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941), and 
not the French surrender of 1940 
nor Hitlers bombing of London. 
This made it clear that the first 
factor of American policy in 
Asia was to avoid its takeover by 
any hostile power. Today, that 
power is China.
Thd second factor in American 
policy in Asia quickly became evi
dent in the tracks of the victorious 
U.S. army in Japan. The Star - 
Spangled Banner drove the ag
gressors away, quickly to be re
placed by business interests-quite 
often for reasons other than stra
tegic and moral. In the footsteps 
of the G.I.S. the Bankers of San 
Fransisco and New York, the in
dustrialists. and the import - ex
port specialists blazed a trail in 
South Korea. Thailand. Indonesia, 
and Malaysia, radiateed to For
mosa and settled down in Hong 
Kong. Rubber, metals, petroleum 
spices, labor, future markets; all 
the givens were present. Van
quished Japan made a profit on 
the dollar trasfusion, enabling the 
Japanese financial system to rest 
largly on some three billion dol
lars lent to the firms by the Am
erican banks.
It is for these two reasons that 
the U.S.. already attracted to the 
Chinese market, tried to prevent 
China from coming under com
munist control. Their clumsi
ness, the corruption of the Nation
alist Chinese, and the pressure of 
history made them fail. Mao es
tablished himself in Peking in 19-
49. From then on, it was not clear
what policy the Americans were 
going to follow.
The Korean was (and now the 
Vietnamese conflict) partly an
swer that question. The U. S. 
is now much less opposed to Red 
China and the existence of com
munist regimes in N. Korea and 
N. Vietnam than it is to the ex
tension of communism to other 
countries or parts of Asia. More 
precisely, it is opposed to the ex
tension of the Chinese influence.
For this reason, the U. S. re
nounced the bombing of the Chin
ese sanctuary at the height of the 
Korean action. Today, it still 
avoids a widening of the Vietna
mese conflict into China. When 
it under-rates thd Pueblo incident 
instead of castigating N. Korea, 
one can see the same attitude. 
(To this we should add the de
sire to avoid opening a second 
front at this time.)
But to protect its business in
terests. the U. S. persists in wan
ting a South Korea inside South 
Vietnam, as if Saigon could be 
a Seoul. It also insists in bring
ing its help' to the neighboring 
countries, hoping to effect a halt 
to the spread of communism in 
Asia similar to that in Europe. 
However, the conditions are dif
ferent. and the American goals are 
running into unforseen difficul
ties.
When Stalin died, he had 
reached and sometimes surpassed 
old Russian objectives. The USSR 
was able to resume a peaceful 
co-existence, and substitute the 
status-qup for expansion. China, 
on the other hand, is just emerg
ing from a night of oblivion. She 
will regell against an internat
ional system which was establish
ed, without an against her, some 
twenty-five years ago by the three 
great powers. The U. S. contrad
icts itself when it pretends to pre
vent the extension of communism

in Asia without having to attack 
China itself. It also contradicts 
itself when it humors China with 
out trying to sdttle their deepseated conflicts.
In Europe, during the cold 
war, the American business world 
had no serious problems, and the 
dollar kept its throne. Today. Am
erica threatens its own capitalism 
under the pretext of saving it 
elsewhere. Although the pursuit 
of thd Vietnamese war gives birth 
to contracts for some enterprises, 
it has also upset some top bus
iness men. This group is wor
ried by the constant defict of 
the balance of payments, and by 
its consequences: monetary depre
ciation. limitation of the Johnson 
plan, and various threats of state 
control
Historically, the war has never 
been more than a police operation, 
a temporary expedition, an acci
dent. Normal life remains one of 
business. On the other hand, the U.
S. feels that it cannot deliver the 
management of Asia to the hands 
of China, especially to the hands 
of China, especially now that the 
British are withprawing their in
terests.
To destroy China, or to have 
the dollar destroued. Such a 
choice, if it really came, would 
have world-wide consequences. 
This is why several governments 
have attempted to convince Pres
ident Johnson that a cease-fire 
with N. Vietnam and the participarion of the N. L. F. in the new
S. Vidtnamese regimewould not be 
followed by the Chinese take-over 
of the country. This argument 
is supported by the examples of 
nationalistic communism found in 
Yougolslavia. Oriental Europe and 
Cuba.
If the U. S. decides to extend 
a cease - fire to Vietnam, peace 
will be possible, and the main 
goals of its Asiatic program will 
be spared, at leat for a while. 
If the U. S. refuses, it will not 
be able to evade the choice much

Page 12 - THE TARTAN - Wednesday, April 3, 1968kThe Student As Nigger
by
g,ffH Frber
Students are niggers. When 
you get that straight, our school 
begins to make sense. Its more 
important, though, to understand 
why theyre niggers. If we follow 
that question seriously enough, it 
will lead us past the zone of aca
demic bullshit, where dedicated 
teachers pass their knowledge on 
to a new generation, and into the 
nitty-gritty of human needs and 
hangups. And from there we can 
go on to consider whether it 
might ever be possible for students 
to come up from slavery.
First lets see whats happen
ing now. Lets look at the role 
students play in what we like to 
call education.
.........Into The Cafeteria
At Cai State L.A., where I teach, 
the students have separate and un
equal dining facilities. If I take 
them into the faculty dining 
room, my colleagues get uncom
fortable, as though there were a 
bad smell. If I eat in the student 
cafeteria, I become known as the 
educational equivalent of a niggerlover. In at least one building 
there are even rest rooms which 
students may not use. At Cal 
State, there is an unwritten law 
barring student - faculty lovemaking. Fortunately, this anti
miscegenation law, like its South
ern counterpart, is not 100 per
cent effective.
Academic Lowndes County
Students at Cal State are polit
ically disnefranchised. They are 
in an academic Lowndes County. 
Most of them can vote in national 
elections - their average age is about 26-but they have no voice in 
the decisions which affect their 
academic lives. The students are. 
it is true, allowed to have a toy 
government run for the most part 
by Uncle Toms and concerned 
principally with trivia. The fac
ulty and administrators decide 
what courses will be offered; the 
students get to choose their own 
Homecoming Queen. Occasional
ly when student leaders get up
pity and rebellious, they  re 
either ignored, put off with tri
vial concessions, or manoeuvered 
expertly out of position.
Hell Fail Your Ass
A student at Cal State is ex
pected to know his place. He calls 
a faculty member Sir or Doc
tor or Professor - and he 
smiles and shuffles some as he 
stands outside the professors of
fice waiting for permission to en
ter. The faculty tell him what to 
read, what to write, and, frequen
tly, where to set the margins on 
his typewriter. They tell him 
whais true and what isnt. Some 
teachers insist that they encour
age dissent but theyre almost al
ways jiving and every student 
knows it. Tell the man what he 
wants to hear or hell fail your 
ass out of the course.
When a teacher says jump, 
students jump. I know of one 
professor who refused to take up 
class time for exams and requir
ed students to show up for tests 
at 6:30 in the morning. And they 
did, by God. Another, at exam 
time, provides answer cards to be 
filled out-each one enclosed in a 
paper bag with a hole cut in the 
top to see through. Students stick 
their writing hands in the bags 
while taking the test. The teach
er isnt a provo; I wish he were. 
He does it to prevent cheating. 
Another colleague once caught 
a student reading during one of 
his lectures and threw her book 
against the wall. Still another lec
tures his students into a stupor and 
then screams at them in a Rage 
when they fall asleep.
Just last week during the first 
meeting of a class, one girl got up 
to leave after about ten minutes
had gone by. The teacher rushed 
over, grabbed her by the arm, 
saying This class is NOT dis
missed! and led her back to her 
seat. On the same day another 
teacher began by informing his 
class that he does not like beards, 
mustaches long hair on boys, or 
capri pants on girls, and will not 
tolerate any of that in his class. 
The class, incidentally, consisted 
mostly of high school teachers.
Even more discouraging than 
this Auschwitz approach to edu
cation is the fact that the students 
take it.They havent gone through 
twelve years of public school for 
nothing. Theyve learned one 
thing during those twelve years. 
Theyve forgotten their algebra. 
Theyre hopelessly vague about 
chemistry and physics. Theyve 
grown to fear and resent liter
ature. They write like theyve 
been lobotomized. But, Jesus, can 
they follow orders! Freshmen come 
up to me with an essay and ask 
if I want it folded, and whether 
their name should be in the up
per right hand corner. And I want 
to cry and kiss them and caress 
their poor tortured heads.
Two Truths
Students dont ask that orders 
make sense. They give up expect
ing things to make sense long be
fore they leave elementary school. 
Things are true becausd the teach
er says theyre true. At a very 
early age we all learn to accept 
two truths, as did certain med
ieval churchmen. Outside of class 
things are true to your tongue, 
your fingers, your stomach, your 
heart.Inside class, things are true 
by reason of authority. And thats 
just fine because you dont care 
anyway. Miss Wiedemeyer tells 
you a noun is a person, place or 
thing. So let it be. You dont give 
a rats ass; she doesnt give a rats 
ass.
The important thing is to please 
her. Back in kindergarten, you 
found out that teachers only love 
children who stand in nice straight 
lines. And thats where its been 
at ever since. Nothing changes ex
cept to get worse. School becomes 
more and more obiviously a prison 
Last year I spoke to a student 
assembly at Manual Arts High 
School and then couldnt get out 
of the god-dam school. I mean 
there was NO WAY OUT. Lock
ed doors. High fences. One of the 
inmates was trying to make it 
over a fence when he saw me 
coming and froze in panic. For a 
moment I expected sirens, a rat
tle of bullets, and him claw, 
ing the fence.
No Spades in Pointy Shoes
Then theres the infamous 
code of dress. In some high 
schools, if your skirt looks too 
short, you have to kneel before 
the principal, in a brief allegory 
of fellatio. If the hem doesnt 
reach the floor, you go home to 
change while he. presumably, 
jacks off.Boys in high school can't 
be too sloppy and they can't even 
be too sharp. Youd think the 
school board would be delighted 
to see all the spades trooping to 
school in pointy shoes, suits, ties 
and stigy brims. Uh-uh. They're 
too visible.
W7hat school amounts to, then, 
for white and black kids alike, 
is a 12-year course in how to be 
slaves. What else could explain 
what I see in a freshman class? 
Theyve got that slave mentality: 
obliging and ingratiating on the 
surface but hostile and resistent 
underneath.
As do black slaves, students 
vary in their awareness of what's 
going on. Some recognize their 
own put - on for what it is and 
even let their rebellion break
through to the surface now and 
then. Others - including most of 
the good students - have been 
more deeply brainwashed. They 
swallow the bullshit with greedy 
mouths. They honest - to - God 
believe in grades, in busy work, 
in General Education require
ments. Theyre pathetically eager 
to be pushed around. Theyre like 
those old grey - headed house nig
gers you can still find in the South 
who dont see what all the fuss 
is about because Mr. Charlie 
treats us real good.
College entrance requirements 
tent to favor the Toms and screen 
out the rebels. Not entirely, of 
course. Some students at Cal State 
L. A. are expert conartists who 
know perfectly well whats hap
pening. They want the degree or 
the 2-S anpapwnd their years on 
the old plantation alternately 
laughing and cursing as they play 
the game. If their egos are strong 
enough, they cheat a lot. And of 
course, even the Toms are angry 
down deep somewhere. But it cojes out in passive witted and sub
ject to frequent spells of laziness. 
They mis-read simple questions. 
They spend their nights mechani
cally outlining history chapters 
while meticulously failing to com
prehend a word of whats in front 
of them.
Fresh Pimples
The saddest cases among both 
black slaves and student slaves 
are the ones who have so thoro
ughly introjected their masters 
values that their anger is all turn
ed inward. At Cal State these 
are the kids for whom every low 
grade is torture, who stammer and 
shake when they speak to a pro
fessor, who go through an emo
tional crisis every time theyre 
called upon during class. You can 
recognize them easily at finals 
time. Their faces are festooned 
with pimples; their bowels boil 
audibly across the room. If there 
really is a Last Judgement, then 
the parents and teachers who cre
ated these wrecks are going to 
burn in hell.
So students are niggers. Its 
time to find out why, and to do 
this we have to take a look at 
Mr. Charlie.
Thd teachers I know best are 
college professors. Outside the 
classroom and taken as a group, 
their most striking characteristic 
is timidity. Theyre short on balls.
Just look at their working condi
tions. At a time when even mi
grant workers have begun to fight 
and win, college professors are 
still afraid to make more than a 
token effort to improve their piti
ful econimic status. They lie flat 
on their stomachs with their pants 
down, mumbling catch phrases 
like professional dignity and 
meaningful dialogue.
Short On Balls
At any rate, teachers ARE short 
on balls. And. as Judy Eisenstein 
has eloquently pointed out. the 
classroom offers an artificial and 
protected environment in which 
they can exercise their will to 
power. Your neighbors may drive 
a better car; gas station attendants 
may intimidate you; the State Leg
islature may shit on you; your 
wife may dominate you; but in the 
classroom, by God. students do 
what you say- or else. The grade 
is a hell of a weapon. It may not 
rest on your hip. potent and ri
gid like a cops gun, but in the 
long run its more powerful.
At your personal whim - any 
time you choose - you can keep
35 students up for nights and have 
the pleasure of seeing them walk 
into the classroom pasty-faced and 
red-eyed carrying a sheaf of type
written pages, with title page. M 
LA footnotes, and margins set at 
15 and 91.
The general timidity which 
causes teachers to make niggers 
of their students usually includes 
a more specific fear - fear of the 
students themselves. After all. 
students are different, just like
black people. You stand exposed 
in front of them, knowing that 
their interests, their values, and 
their language are different from 
yours. To make matters worse, 
you may suspect that you your
self are not the most engaging 
of persons. What, then, can pro
tect you from their ridicule and 
scorn?
Respect for authority. Thats 
what. Its the policemans gun 
again. The white bwanas pith hel
met. So you flaunt that authority. 
You wither wisperors with a mur
derous glance. You crush objec
tors with erudition and heavy 
irony. And. worst of all, you make 
your own attainments seem not 
accesible but awesomely remote. 
You conceal your massive ig
norance - and prade a slender 
learning.
Killing Literature
The teachers fear is mixed with 
an understandable need to be ad
mired and to feel superior-a need 
which also makes him cling to his 
white supermacy. Ideally, a 
teacher should minimize the dis
tance between himself and his 
students. He should encourage 
them not to need him- eventual
ly or even immediately. But this 
is rarely the case. Teachers make 
themselves high priests of arcane 
mysteries. They become masters 
of mumbo - jumbo. Even a more 
or less conscientious teacher may 
be torn between the need to give 
and the need to hold back, be
tween the desire to free his stu
dents and the desire to hold them 
in bondage to him.
A Whole Lot of Niggers
You can add sexual repression 
to the list of causes, along with 
vanity, fear, and will to power, 
that turn the teacher into Mr. 
Charlie. You might also want to 
keep in mind that he was a nig
ger once himself and has never 
really gotten over it. And there 
are more causes, some of which 
are described better in sociologi
cal than in psychological terms. 
Work them out. its not hard. But 
in the meantime, what weve got 
on our hands is a whole lot of nig
gers. And what makes this parti
cularly grim is that the student 
has less chance than the black 
man of getting out of his bag. 
Because the student doesnt even 
know hes in it. That, more or 
less, is whats happening in high
er education. And the results are 
staggering.
At my school, we even grade 
poeple on how they read poetry. 
Thats like grading people on how 
they fuck. But we do it. In fact, 
God help me, I do it. I'm the 
Adolph Eichmann of English 323. 
Simon Legree on the poetry plan
tation. Tote that Lamb!" Lift that 
spindee! Even to discuss a good 
poem in that environment is porentially dangerous because the 
very classroom is contaminated. 
As hard as I may try to turn stu
dents on to poetry. I know that 
the desks, the tests, the IBM 
Cards, their own attitudes toward 
school, and my own residue of 
UCLA method are turning them 
off.
Another result of student slavvery is equally serious. Students 
don't get emancipated when they 
graduate. As a matter of fact, 
we don't let them graduate until 
they've demonstrated there wil
lingness-over 16 years- to remain 
slaves. And for important jobs, 
like teaching, we make them go 
through more years just to make 
sure. What I'm getting at is that 
we re all more or less niggers and 
slaves, teachers and students alike. That is a fact you want to 
start with in trying to understand 
wider school phenomena, say. pol
itics. in our country and in other 
countries.
Educational oppression is tric
kier to fight than racial oppres
sion. If youre a black rebel, they 
cant exile you; they either intim
idate you or kill you. But in high 
school or college they can just
bounce you out of the fold. And 
they do.
Rebel students and renegard 
faculty members get smothered 
or shot down with devestating ac
curacy. In high school, its usual
ly the student who gets it ; in col
lege its more often the teacher. 
Others get tired of fighting and k 
voluntarily leave the system. This 
may be a mistake though. Drop
ping out of college for a rebel is 
like going North for a Negro. You 
cant really get away from it so 
vou might as well stav and raise 
hell.
How do you raise hell? Thats 
a whole other article. But just for 
a start, why not stay with the an
alogy? What have black people t 
done? They have, first of all. fac
ed the fact of their slavery. They
've stopped kidding themselves about an eventual reward in that 
Great Watermelon Patch in the 
Sky. Theyve organized; theyve 
decided to get freedom now, and 
theyve started taking it.
Students like black people, 
have immense unused power. 
They could, theoretically, insist > 
on participating in their own edu
cation. They could make academic 
freedom bilateral. They could 
teach their teachers to thrive on 
love and admiration, rather than 
fear and respect, and to lay down 
their weapons. Students could dis
cover community. And they could 
learn to dance by dancing on the 
IBM cards. They could make col
oring books out of the catalogs * 
and put the graping system in a 
museum. They could raze one set 
of walls and let life come blow
ing into the classroom. They could 
raze another set of walls and let 
education glow out and flood the 
streets. They could turn the class
rooms into where its at- a field 
of action' as Peter Marin descri
bes it. And believe it or not, they 
could study eagerly and learn pro
digiously for the best of all pos
sible reasons- their own reasons.
They could. Theoretically. They 
have the power. But only in a very 
few places, like Berkely. have 
they even begun to think about 
using it. For students, as for black 
people, the hardest battle isnt 
with Charlie. Its with what Mr. 
Charlie has done to your mind.

The All Sports Trophy
by Afan Letzt
Eight varsity teams compete each year, donning the Tech red and 
white jerseys: however, intramural sports continue to attract an equal 
or greater amount of interest and support from the Student Body. The 
race for the coveted All - Sports Trophy is of major concern to all in
volved. This year, there's a tight contest between the E. J's, the dorm 
organization with 44 points. BTP with 44. SAE with 42V8. and GSIA 
with 41.
Thd E.J.s have a large reservoir from which to select players and 
have taken championships in call pool, foul shooting and table tennis. 
SAE won the bowloing championship and took the second and third
place postion in bath co-rec volleyball and volleyball. BTP, last years 
all sports trophy winner, copped the touch football crown as well as 
winning soccer, swimming and squash. And GSIA was victorious in 
volleyball and 3 - man volleyball, while taking second place in foul 
shooting, golf and basketball.
PKA won the track meet for the last two years and would be de
priving the competing teams of vital points if it swept the meet once 
more. Softball is a major sport which will be the decidning factor. 
Two points are awarded the first place team of each league and two 
points to the winner of the playoffs. The E. J.s were the softball 
champs last year and SAE the year before.
When E. J.s are credited with ten points for tennis at the con
clusion of the playoffs, this will boost them into the lead. Howeverever. there are enough points up for grabs to enable any one of the four 
competitors to win the trophy.
The varsity track, tennis and golf seasons have started this week 
and seek student support. The tennis team is hoping to repeat or im
prove its 6-1-1 record of last season. CMU students and faculty can 
view their team in action here Thursday against St. Francis at 2:30. 
Saturday against Waynesburg at 1:00, and Tuesday also at 1:00 against 
St. Vincent.
The track team, 6-4 last year, will compete in a trianglar meet 
against Stj Francis and Waynesburg today at 3:30. Another track 
meet at the Tech field will take place on Saturday at 1:30 against 
Indiana University.
On Friday, the golf team will confront our fridnds from Pitt on 
the Longue Vue Country Club course at 1:00.

Thd 1968 varsity track season 
opens at home today at 3:30 with 
a triangular meet against Wavneburg and St. Francis. Itll be a 
good season for the spectators as 
there are seven meets at home and 
only five away.
As for the track team itself it is 
going to be a long hard season. 
The team is small this year with 
oly about twenty - five partici
pants and as a result, as with most 
of Carnegie's teams, it is lack
ing in depth.
has possibilities but only time 
will determine whether or not they 
turn out. Many of the runners are 
young and inexperienced in col
lege competition. The freshman 
are few in number but show some 
good potential. There is only one 
senior on the team this year - 
Steve Avlor. who. broad jumps, 
and triple jumps, and throws the 
javelin.
Coach Vamos said. The team 
is definitely not as strong as it 
appeared it would be at the end 
of last year's season. The top 
three scorers including the tow 
co-captains (none of whom gradu
ated) have all failed to come out 
this year for reasons varying from 
personal problems to spring foot
ball to jsut plain apathy. Conse
quently the team is lacking, per
haps critically, experienced run
ners in the distances, quarter mile 
and the hurdles. On the bright 
side the team is going to be strong 
in the sprints and the wight 
events."
All in all it looks to be a rough 
year ahead with a lot of close 
competition and several new op
ponents. including Case Tech.. 
Cleveland State, and Western Re
serve. The second meet of the 
season is this Saturday. April 6. 
at 1:30 on the Tech Field against 
Indiana State University.
The. CMU golf team opens its 
season this week, competing 
against district small colleges. 
The Tartan golfers will play a 
tough schedule, consisting of one 
triangular and nine dual matches. 
Coach William Rogers will be 
trying to improve the record of 
the 1967 team, which had a 5-4- 
1 slate.
Three top golfers from last 
year's team will be absent this 
season. Captain and Most Valu
able Player John Mulholland has 
graduated, along with Bill Bug
ler and Bob Basier. These three 
lettermen were the mainstay of 
last years successful team.
But coach Rogers has promising 
material for the upcoming sea
son. Four lettermen. seniors Ran
dy Broden and Bill Habel. junior 
Karl Weigand. and sophomore 
John Oroukin. will form the nu
cleus of this year's team. The re
mainder will be chosen from the 
twenty golfers who have been 
competing in the trials at the 
Long Vue Country Club, the Tar
tans' home course.
Coach Rogers plans to field a 
squad of eight, although only 6 
golfers compete in varsity golf 
matches. Performance through
out the season will determine 
which members of the squad 
earn the right to play. Hopefully, 
this added incentive, along with 
the experienced players who are 
returning, will provide the 1968 
golf team with a winning season.

The lecture will be the 14th in 
the distinguished series of annual 
addresses centering on the social 
implications of scientific and tech
nological advances in the life sci
ences. The series was initiated in 
1954 in honor of Dr. Walter Van 
Dyke Bingham, founder and di
rector of the Division of Applied 
Psychology at Carnegie Institute 
of Tdchnologv in 1915. The divi
sion was the first of its kind in 
the nation.

the psychological damage caused 
by segregation was cited by the 
US Supreme Court in its 1954 de
cision on school desegregation, 
is co - founder of the Northside 
Centdr for Child Development in 
New York City. He also founded 
Harldm Youth Opportunities Un

gro problem as it relates to mod
ern democracy, which has been 
published under the tile An Amer
ican Dilemma.
Dr. Clark is author of Prejudice 
and Your Child and Dark Ghetto:

viser to the US State Department 
and consultant to the RANDCorporation. Western Electric Com
pany. and various foundations.

Universities are not employ
ment agencies, but instead are 
educational institutions. It takes 
no imagination and in fact n o 
brains to realize the purpose of 
the Dow Chemical Company, the 
CIA or the military. They make 
no contribution ot the education
al aims of this or any other uni
versity. Why should we help or
ganizations skilled in the fine 
arts of killing, subversion, and 
secrecy when in fact these are 
counter to the major purposes 
of this university? Clearly, this 
university permits the use of its 
facilities for purposes which are 
not educational.
W'hy are our enlightened Ad
ministration permitting them
selves and our university to be so 
used? They may argue that we 
are students and they as educa
tors have the right to hear what 
these organizations, a s well a s 
others, have to say. And, of course, 
we do! We have a right to read 
any pointed material, yet our 
library does not provide Playboy. 
Maybe this is because our guardi
ans feel that it is not educational, 
or maybe it is simply that the li
brary administrators realize that 
to provide free access to all infor
mation is impossible. To visit the 
military recuriter at a federal 
building would require no great
er inconvenience than to buy Play
boy at the local newstand.
So the evidence shows that with 
respect to providing for the things 
the student does have a right to
 as, of course, it must. Accept
ing this limited obligation it then 
gives priority to non-educational 
enterprises, such as the military, 
to make free use of both its facilitites and good name.
One would be blind, be he ad
ministrator or student, if he be
lieved that such facilities were
provided indiscriminately to all 
those desiring to interview stu 
dents. They do discriminate, as 
they must one thye have decided 
to assume this non - educational 
function. Yet the only sound bas
is for discrimination, use by le
gitimate educational enterprises, 
is not the Dolicv.
As a result of the absence of 
foresight and imagination, the 
the university has a policy per
mitting discrimination with re
spect to those using university fa
cilities, yet not in fact based on 
the only legitimate critera of the 
user being an agent of an edrcational activity. Realizing that the 
university does not allow freee 
access to its facilities, we have 
called upon the administration of 
this university t o which the 
claims of those asking for con
venience against those who plead 
a deep moral conviction. It is 
unworthy of this university, out 
of stubborness and thoughtless
ness, to them a deaf ear to the le
gitimate moral sentiments of its 
students and faculty. The admin
istration of this university has an 
obligation to confront great mor
al questions and not to continue 
to be so vain as to suppose that 
their opinions commit the univer
sity communitv.Henry Steele Commager. pro
fessor of history at Amherst Col
lege, expressed the feelings o f 
many who have requested action 
from the university when he wrote
 If presidents, deants, trustees 
and regents are unwilling or un
able to protect and exalt the dig
nity of the university, they should 
be grateful to students who have 
remembered it and exalted it. If 
universities have refused to face 
the major moral issues of our day 
they should rejoice that they have, 
somehow, helped to produce stu
dents who are neither paralyzed 
nor timid, who are sensitive to 
moral issues and prepare to re
spond to them, however, convul
sively. E. S. Fuller, Jr.

An Open Letter 
To President Stever
We appreciate your prompt 
consideration of our petition and 
your promise of letters to our 
President and congressmen.
We do not agree, however, that 
the coercion of one governmen
tal organization is never an ef
fective means of instituting 
change in another. Note, also that 
Hershev finds enough overlap be
tween these two governmental agencies to call for selective ser
vice reclassification of those 
interfering with recruiting. "
As we have stated in earlier 
open letters to the campus, the 
A.C.L.U. believes that the Hershey . Clark statement still in
vites local draft boards to judge 
and prosecute studnets for unAmerican activities. Our Point is 
that the courts - and not the local 
draft boards-must decide whethdr 
or not a citizen is guilitv of a 
crime and to be punished.
The recent reclassification of 
an Oberlin undergraduate for his 
participation in an anti-recruiting 
demonstration supports our con
tention that Hershevs directive 
is still in effect. Oberlin's Presi
dent Robert Carr has, as a result, 
reversed his original position, and 
banned recruiting on that campus 
with full backing by his board of 
trustees.
We would regret having to wait 
for one of our students to be pro
secuted and sentenced by his 
draft board before you would 
consider taking more meaningful 
action on our behalf.
Yours,
Gary Aiken

Thd ceremony marking the re
tirement of Lt. Col. Peter J. Ac
cord from the United States Army 
has made it depressingly clear 
that we are nearing the end of 
an era in the ROTC Department 
at Carnegie-Mellon University.
When Col. William S. Crock
er retires in June, a period which 
has witnessed somr truly out
standing accompli' nents will 
have come to an
These two men are not only 
dedicated officers, they are hu
man beings, and perhaps this was 
their most significant accomplish
ment. They came to a military 
department which was being op
erated a s a military academy 
would have been. The officer 
cadre was known, distantly, to 
the cadets. Even seniors consi
dered them to be remote and 
aloof.
Once Colonels Accorti an d 
Crocker were entrenched, they 
undertook a program of humaniz
ation and involvement in the prob
lems of their cadets. Realizing 
that the ROTC Brigade could not 
be operated as a regular military 
unit, the strove to understand the 
personal problems of every cadet 
in the prgram and to make them
selves available as counselors and 
confidants.
The measure of their success 
can be shown by the increased in
volvement and enrollment in the 
corps of cadets, both at the basic 
level and at the advanced level. 
Three years ago, the brigade was 
in a position which necessitated 
placing juniors in the positions 
of officers because there were not
enough seniors to go around. At 
this time, the brigade is in the 
position of having more than 
enough seniors to go around, and 
putting juniors in the positions of 
officers only because of the in
creased size of the brigade.
During the Crocker-Accorti era 
this campus saw many good men, 
officers and enlisted men alike, 
come and go. Threr was the then 
Major Johnson, who conducted 
Military History class with a flair. 
Ther was Happy Leroy Cose, 
who, with his gerbils and night 
classes, showed that an officer 
can be an intelligent human be
ing, and not an overbearing dis
ciplinarian.
There was Major Steinbach, 
who, with his I can get it for 
you wholesale attitude, his snap
py dress, and his understanding 
ways brough a new kind of class 
to ROTC.
Among the enlisted men. we 
saw Sergeants Murphy, Speller, 
Lowther, Kirby, and the soon to 
retire Huveldt and O'Shaugnessy, all of whom yelled loud and 
long and then looked the other 
way. And then there were the 
supply sergeants, the only men 
we couldn't convince they were
nt on a military post, and who 
kept muttering things about rec
ords. inventories and Inspector 
Generals.
This may sound like a lot of 
nostalgic garbage, but the cadre 
members who will be here next 
year would do well to never for
get the examples that have been 
presented to then on how to run 
a successful ROTC Department 
at a university such as ours.

ednsays,So Hgnz mtiS Aj 
makes an artificial separation 
of the role and place of both 
male and female members of 
society. A guy in the dorms has 
little contact with girls in every
day settings. Such a system 
does nothing to break down in
correct images or ideas that 
one sex may have about the 
other. This may make it dif
ficult or even impossible for 
someone to ever get to know 
a person of the apposite sex 
as a thinking, reasoning, and 
real person. From the male 
point of view a girl may just 
be a sexual object. Thus the 
present system hinders the de
velopment of person land limits 
his experience to the thinking 
of friends of the same sex.
I can only speak for myself 
and people I know, but co-ed 
dorm situation formed from the 
dorms presently in existence 
would be a start. Those living 
in dorms can easily tell of the 
results of the present situation. 
Girls do not want guys around 
because they do not want to 
take their curiers out before 
they eat breakfast. Guys are not 
used to having girls around 
and you can tell this just by 
listening to the language in all 
dorms. Responsibility just is 
not present because it does not 
seem to be needed. Since it is 
obvious that these people will 
not live like this for the rest 
of their lives, why are they be
ing artificially controlled and 
forced to live in a manner that 
makes later life something 
strange and not normal?

SHUT UP...
ednsays,So Hgnz mtiS Aj 
corded by us is not exactly what 
came to our senses from the 
outside. So it is a mistake to 
believe the police officer is any 
more dispassionate than the de
fendant in a criminal case.
Third-and this is the most 
dangerous thing of allit is a 
mistake to think that all police 
officers are willing to report 
all things truthfully. Of course 
we all believe that the police 
are basically true and honest, 
but unfortunately there are a 
number of police officers who 
will twist iand distort anything 
said to them suit the needs of 
their arrest report so that they 
may make every arrest seem 
airtight and perfect; so that 
they get a success, not justice; 
so that they serve their own 
records, not the letter of the 
law. Because of the fact that 
these officers do this and be
cause not one of you know 
which of the officers one meets 
in the course of ones life may 
be of this type, it is the worst 
folly to take ia chance on the 
truth of a police when you 
dont know if he is one of the 
truthful ones or one of the bad 
ones.
And there is another reason 
for keeping quiet, which is 
greater than all the rest com
bined and for which many, 
many people fought and died 
and which you should honor by 
observing. And that is your 
right to keep quiet. You should 
assert this as your right to your
own individual freedom, as your 
right as a member of this de
mocracy for whatever it does 
stand for, and to make it stand 
for the most that it should 
stand for.
