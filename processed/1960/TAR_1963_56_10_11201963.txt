Peace Corps Members Discuss 
Progress, Mon. thru Fri.
All this week Peace Corps representatives are at Carnegie 
Tech. We are here as an informational service, mainly, to clear up many misconceptions about requirements for volun
teers, Polly Feingold, Peace Corps co-ordinator of the pro
gram, stated. ?
Return volunteers who have 
completed service overseas in 
many of the 48 countries where 
Peace Corps workers are station
ed, have been speaking with stu
dents and will end their program 
on Friday.
They are administering non
competitive placement tests every 
day to interested students. At 2:30 
today and tomorrow they will be 
prepared to give the tests in 132-E 
AH. Friday their headquarters 
will be 229B AH.
Members of the group are eager 
to speak to any organization on 
campus. They have already ad
dressed several social fraternities 
on campus. Their schedule for to
night includes talks at Alpha Tau 
Omega, Tau Delta Phi, and Mudge 
House. Today at 11:30 and 12:30 
in the Wherrett Lounge, Skibo, 
they will talk with commuters. 
Thursday they will visit Theta Xi, 
and Sigma Nu, and Morewood 
Gardens. Other groups may still 
arrange for talks by contacting 
anyone of the representatives.
The Peace Corps visit to Car
negie Tech is only a part of the 
Corps program this week in 
Pittsburgh. Representatives have 
also set up centers at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, Duquesne 
University, and Chatham College. 
Mayor Joseph Barr has further 
declared this week Peace Corps 
Week in the city to emphasize 
the activities.
Camp Offers 
Frosh Unique 
Experience
An unprecedented educational 
workshop program is being of
fered to qualified college men this 
summer at Camp Enterprise in 
Hamilton, New York, on July 8- 
August 2, 1964. The program has 
been designed by the Presidents 
Professional Association, the edu
cational organization of com
pany presidents, and it is a pro
gram intended for outstanding 
college men who have completed 
their freshman year and are in
terested in careers as business 
leaders.
The programs outstanding fea
ture is the active participation 
of over sixty company presidents, 
top-flight executives and distin
guished management educa
tors. Participating college students 
will have the unique opportunity 
to work closely with these in
fluential men, to share their com
bined knowledge of business and 
their broad and varied business 
experience, and to receive valu
able career guidance from some 
of the nations most succcessful 
business leaders.
This program accentuates a dy
namic approach to understanding

Campus Chest, Techs annual 
charity drive, begins its cam
paign soon. This year the Cam
pus Chest drive is devoted wholly 
to helping students. There are 
students the world over who des
perately need help from their 
fellow students. The funds from 
the drive, which will be concen
trated into four short days from 
December 4-8, will go directly 
for aid to students in three cate
gories: international, national, 
and local, including a new Tech 
scholarship.
The unique feature of Cam
pus Chest is that it is the only 
campus-wide charity appeal. It 
appeals to you as students to help 
other students who are like you 
only less fortunate. Many stu
dents feel reluctant to give when 
their parents contribute to the 
United Fund. However, the stu
dent aid programs that benefit 
from Campus Chest are not in
cluded in the United Fund.
Internationally, the Campus 
Chest contributes to the World 
University Service. World Uni
versity Service (WUS) is an as
sociation of students and profes
sors who assist nations by shar
ing material and knowledge with 
their contemporaries throughout 
the world. WUS uses its contri
butions by concentrating on stu
dent health, food and lodging, 
educational activities, individual 
and emergency aid. WUS meets 
the needs of students and univer
sities facing emergency disaster, 
the chronically under-privileged, 
as well as those struggling against 
handicaps in their search for 
learning.
Ralph J. Bunch of the WUS 
expresses his plea: Whether in 
Asia or Africa, Europe or the 
Americas, the students road is 
hard, their needs critical. They 
can count on friends. One is 
World University Service . . . 
giving a hand to the leaders of 
tomorrow. In the new nations 
of Africa and Asia the educa
tional opportunities must be bet
ter if they are to meet the chal
lenges of newly formed nations.

that!) $1.00 a month will insure 
an adult Congolese student and 
his whole family in a medical 
insurance plan. $2.50 will buy a 
pair of eyeglasses for an Indian 
student. $6.25 a month will en
able a student in India to carry 
on his studies by awarding him 
a service scholarship.
International WUS projects en
able the non-white population of 
Southern Africa to receive uni
versity education. Their programs 
include the equipping of stu

scholarships for South African 
refugee students at the Univer
sity of Basutoland. Since its be
ginning in 1919, fifty countries 
participated in the WUS pro
gram. The students of the recipi
ent countries try to match the 
amounts contributed by WUS 
projects in a valiant effort at 
self-help.
A contribution from you dem

The Conjugal Bed
(Squirel Hill Theatre: showings at 6:20, 8:15 and 10:15)
The Conjugal Bed comes to Pittsburgh with high criti
cal acclaim, including slaps on the back by those two pur
veyors of 9 to 5 sophistication, Time magazine and Bosley 
Crowther (you remember Bosley, hes the one who fell 
t asleep during LAventurra.) In any case, it is sad to report
that the movie provokes only an occasional chuckle through 
an eveloping haze of ennui. Director Marco Ferreri sets out 
to show us that woman spells death, but instead proves 
sex can be boring.
The result is somewhat unfortunate since Ferreris 
theme might lead itself to a rollicking satirical spoof, and 
since his two leading actors  Ugo Tognazzi and Marina 
Vladyhandle themselves with superb skill. Were present, ed with a middle-aged bon vivant about to marry a young,
chaste would-be nymphet. She explains that shes saving 
herself for marriage, because it is the only gift I can give 
you. Hurrah, we yell, lets get on with the film. Playboy 
Tognazzi, whose rutted features recall a road-show version 
of Gar^ Merill, does indeed marry Miss Vlady and moves 
into her home, haunted by pottering aunts and a nimwit 
brother.
It turns out that Miss Vlady has been an untapped 
^ mine of feminine lust; most of their early marriage days 
are spent in bed, with Tognazzi popping out long enough 
to either shut off the television or tell his old friends what 
an extraordinary passion flower hes plucked. Then comes 
an ironic twist: Tognazzi finds, himself no match for his 
horizontally-affectionate wife and seeks added vigah 
through hormone injections. At long last she becomes 
pregnant while poor Tognazzi slides steadily down the path 
of helpless dissipation. Alas, never trust these eternal 
bitches, they seduce you toward the grave, which is precise
ly where Tognazzi winds up (or down).
The Conjugal Beds central metaphor seems exquisitely 
suited to Ferreris intentions: Miss Vlady is the Queen Bee, 
her relatives play the drones in this hive, and Tognazzi 
plays the fated mate, useless once hes served his function. 
All of which waxes admirable, except that the metaphor 
never quite comes off. Great serio-comedies contain ele
ments of both the hilarious and the pathetic. Truffauts 
Shoot The Piano-Player comes to mind here. Ferreris ef
fort, however, reaches neither extremity, drowning some
where between these inviting shoes. His strategy is also 
questionable, for he creates very little suspense. We think 
of the frenetic, contrived but intriguing plot of Divorce 
Italian Style  this films distant cousin in my respects  
and wonder why Ferreri didnt bank on a good story-line to 
sustain interest.
Were we to feel, rather than merely see Tognazzis 
mental and physical erosion, The Conjugal Bed might have 
offered us a very touching modernization of Shakespeares 
knowing sonnet: The expense of reason in a waste of 
shame/Is lust in action ... But of course they didnt 
have hormone injections in Shakespeares day.m

Ubiquitous death stopped for the first time on the 
faculty of Carnegie Tech. Dean C. Russell Hewlett, appar
ently the same one the new gallery is named after, died of 
double pneumonia. He was dean of the school of applied 
design. As a result of his death all the festivities which had 
been planned for the upcoming Carnegie Day (November 
25th), the day when Carnegie was born, were cancelled 
except for the granting of an honorary degree. Dean Hewlett 
was educated at Columbia and spent some years on the 
continent. His funeral services were held in Brooklyn.
Tech was preparing to play its last game of the season 
against Haverford the next week. There were in the Tartan 
of that day several interesting side pieces which serves as 
filler space. One began that after a years study of the health 
situation at Vassar, the authorities have decided that cot
ton mattresses and butter are not conducive to good health. 
As a result butter is now barred from the dinner table and 
the girls are required to sleep on hair mattresses. Another 
was that a freshman at Kansas University recently aston
ished the student body by wearing a monocle.
aRGYRNA Write
Jef fies Column 
Brings Reply 
Of Wonder
Editor, the Tartan:
As the wife of the most eld
erly undergraduate on the Tech 
campus, I do not have easy ac
cess to the Tartan. This is due 
to the fact that my husband 
claims to have far more impor
tant things to carry, such as 
those heavy textbooks and volu
minous engineering notes, for in
stance. But occasionally he does 
bring one home (if I tweak his 
beard a little) so that I can keep 
up with current thinking of to
days college youngsters.
The first time I saw the col
umn heading Candle in the 
Darkness I thought it was a 
little satire, and the name a 
pseudonym. But I checked the 
editorial credits and found that 
this is evidently not true. It 
takes real conceit to put ones 
name under a column with such 
a presumptuous heading as 
Candle in the Darkness, no 
less!
Some time ago I read a won
derful essay by James Thurber 
on his college days, which Jeffies column brought to mind. 
In this essay, Thurber, while 
marching in drill formation, goes 
in one direction, and the entire 
group he is with goes in forma
tion in another. I cannot help 
but think that anyone who so 
consistently marches in a for
mation of one is expressing 
views which are calculated to 
stir controversy  or at least 
some reaction. This he has done 
(my letter included), so he 'is 
a success. It does my heart good 
to see that students write in 
reply to him, even though he 
has contradicted himself several 
times in the few articles I have 
read. In the last issue, every 
letter to the editor was directed 
at something Jeffie said  good 
work!
This column never fails to 
provide us with a chuckle and 
remind us that after all, chil
dren will be children. Ah, sweet 
mysteries of life, Jeffie has found 
them. If Mama and Papa Axlerad ever read this, I have a few 
comforting words for them. 
Dont worry, Jeffie will grow 
up some day; most youngsters 
when backed against the wall 
by reason, common sense, and 
fact, only fight all the harder. 
But as they grow older and a 
little more mature, this ten
dency disappears. If it doesnt, 
they write plays in the manner 
of Tennessee Williams for us un
intellectual clods.
Speaking of a humor maga
zine at Tech, with Candle in 
. the Darkness who needs one?
Sincerely your, 
Lois Vasko
P.S. If my husband reads this, 
my Tartan will be cut off. And 
I dont want to miss the col
umn Jeffie writes on the banning 
of the Jayne Mansfield movie.

A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
Civil RightsII
As promised, this article will discuss civil rights. The 
previous article on this subject discussed the restrictions 
on freedom that would result if pending legislation is pass
ed. Since it is felt that the legislation  or at least the essen
tial parts of it  should not be passed, the question is posed 
of what can (and should) be done. If a person feels, as I 
do, that persons who refuse to serve or associate with indivi
duals of any other race, are wrong (that is my opinion, 
not a fact) in doing so, then the person will put pressure 
on the bigot to change.
But how is this pressure to be applied? Clearly moral 
sanctions will not work since, by themselves, they have 
repeatedly failed in the past. More active measures must 
be taken. Several actions have been successful recently: 
Marches and demonstrations, economic boycotts, and sitins.
Demonstrations arouse public opinion without placing 
blame on any one individual. They get wide attention and 
are noticed by authorities. However, in many Southern 
cities the right to assemble has been denied protest 
groups. (I feel that no government should have this power, 
but that is beside the point now.) What then? I feel that 
demonstrations should be held illegally. If laws are felt to 
be unjust, then they should be broken.
Sit-ins are a different matter. Here the law against tres
passing is not unjust (or at least I dont think so). But the 
sit-ins focus attention on individuals who are most important 
because of their location, symbolism, etc. It may be that 
sit-ins should continue, although when persons are arrest
ed for participating in them, they should not feel persecuted. 
They are paying the price for civil disobedience which may 
be worth the cost, if equal treatment can be materially 
hastened by such actions.
Economic boycotts may be the best of the three methods 
mentioned. They are clearly legal, and Southern officials 
have found a few legal (or illegal) tactics to cope with them. 
Boycotts hurt persons who operate segregated establish
ments where it hurts most  in the pocketbook.
It should be noted that the actions advocated here are 
actions to get equal treatment, not preferential treatment 
It is one thing to ask a businessman to serve or hire a person 
solely on the basis of monetary return or ability, and an
other thing to expect preferential treatment. It is easy to 
use the actions advocated above to force persons to give 
more than fair treatment to pressure groups. But in the 
process, the groups will lose the sympathies of persons who 
believe individuals should be judged solely on their merits. 
The ultimate criterion should be ability  not membership 
or non-membership in any group.

IM Soccer Teams Await Playoffs
As the 1963 IM Soccer season I Beginning this afternoon are I against each other. Thus it will 
draws to a close, the power this the semi-finals, pitting the first be the Dorm-Trojans against Beta 
year seems to be the Internation- [ two teams from each league I Theta Pi and the Internationals 
als again. Champion of both 
leagues last year, the Internation
als have copped the Giant 
League this year, with a 6-0 
record with their only loss coming 
from the Internationals.
In the Bear League the DormTrojans swept through the league 
with six wins and no losses and 
they might pose a strong threat to 
the Internationals. The GradEagles nailed down second place 
with a 5-1 record. As in the 
Giant League, their only loss came 
to the first place team.
Rifle Team 
Splits Dual 
Home Match
The Carnegie Tech varsity rifle 
team split its first home match, 
beating Alliance, but losing to Al
legheny. It was another disap
pointing day for coach Murphy as 
his team again failed to break 
1400.
The final scores were Allegheny 
1414, Carnegie Tech 1397, and Al
liance 1348. Captain Mike Ray 
shot a 285 as did Phil Meyers, 
but no one else could break 280 
for Tech. Bob Fritz turned in a 
277, Dan Mersel, an up-and-com
ing freshman, also shot 277, a fine 
performance in only his second 
match. Mike Knepley, last years 
MVP, had one of his worst days 
ever as his score plummeted to a 
273. The Tartans were hurting 
for depth as Captain Joe Schlitt, 
Tuck Arnold, and Scott McCor 
mick were all unable to fire. The 
Allegheny shooters admittedly 
shot way above their heads while 
Tech had another poor day below 
1400. Carnegie will be looking 
forward to their upcoming re
match.

against the Grad Eagles. The win
ners of these two games will 
battle it out this Saturday for the 
championship.
It has been a tight race in both 
leagues this year with some out
standing games. Crucial contests 
have been the Dorms 4-2 de
cision over the Grad-Eagles and 
the Dorms win over third place 
PKA Gold 2-1. The GradEagles defeated the PKAs 4-1 to 
gain second place in the Bear 
League. This loss gave the PKAs 
a 4-2 season. In the Giant 
League, the Internationals have 
shown a little more superiority by 
defeating the second place Betas 
7-3 and the third place SAEs 6-1. 
Beta trounced SAE 9-0 in order to 
gain their second place position.
By placing in the Soccer finals 
this year, the Grads pick up a 
few more points for their dash 
towards the all sports champion
ship. Next year, soccer will be
