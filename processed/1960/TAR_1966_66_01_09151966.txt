NEW UNIVERSITY PROPOSAL LINKS CIT-MELLON INSTITUTE
New Programs Planned: 
Endowment Would Soar
Pittsburgh, Pa., September 14, 1966A proposal for 
the creation of a new university, Carnegie University, in 
which Mellon Institute would join with Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, is under consideration. The announcement 
was made today by Paul Mellon, chairman of the board 
of trustees of Mellon Institute, and Aiken W. Fisher, 
board chairman at Carnegie Tech.
The proposal calls for Mellon Institute to become Mel
lon Institute of Science of Carnegie University, and all 
of the Institutes endowment, buildings and other prop
ertyvalued at more than $60 millionto become a part 
of the new University. These assets when added to those 
of Carnegie Tech would provide the new Carnegie Uni
versity with assets of approximately $200 million, includ
ing an endowment with a market value of nearly $120 
million. This increase of $60 million in the resources of 
a private university represents one of the largest in the 
history of higher education.
Mellon Institute
Mellon Institute was estab
lished in 1913 by the late 
A. W. Mellon and R. B. Mel
lon to conduct research in 
chemistry, physics, and bio
logical sciences, together 
with industry sponsored re
search and engineering, and 
has achieved a worldwide 
reputation for its many scien
tific contributions. The pro
posed new Mellon Institute 
of Science would include the 
current Mellon Institute re
search and post-doctoral pro
grams, and the Carnegie 
Tech departments of chem
istry, physics, biology, and 
earth and astronomical 
sciences. The buildings and 
facilities of the Mellon Insti
tute would be a principal 
focal point for graduate re
search in this college. The 
aims of the Mellon Institute 
of high quality independent
research, of pioneering ap
plied research, of industrialrelated programs, and of 
post-doctoral research experi
ence would continue as im
portant objectives of the new 
University.
Carnegie Tech
Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology was founded as the 
Carnegie Technical Schools 
in 1900 by gifts from Andrew 
Carnegie and the City of 
Pittsburgh. It received a char
ter with power to confer de
grees in 1912 and is now an 
institution of about 4,000 full
time students with programs 
in science, engineering, fine 
arts, industrial administra
tion, womens education, and 
the humanities and social sci
ences. The name, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, 
would be retained for a col
lege of engineering and ap
plied science of Carnegie
University. It would embrace 
not only Carnegie Techs de
partments in these fields, but 
also some of the industrial and 
research programs of Mellon 
Institute, together with a new 
graduate program in ad
vanced technology.
New College
Another new undergradu
ate college to be established 
according to the proposed 
plan would be the College of 
Humanities and Social Sci
ences, made up of existing 
departments of English, his
tory, psychology, economics, 
and modem languages. Other 
programs and departments 
would be added to this college 
to broaden its scope, and to 
support other elements of the 
University. This new college 
would permit male students 
to earn a B.A. degree, which 
is not possible under Carnegie 
Techs current curriculum.
In addition to these three 
newly established degreegranting colleges, three ex
isting ones will remain essen
tially the same.
The Carnegie College of 
Fine Arts will continue to be 
the focal point of professional 
study in the arts. Independ
ent plans are progressing for 
a new drama center to im
prove the facilities of this 
college.
Margaret Morrison Car
negie College will continue 
its programs in womens edu
cation, with strong emphasis 
on educational research for 
the changing needs of 
women.
The Graduate School of In
dustrial Administration was 
founded by W. L. Mellon in
1949. One of the countrys 
outstanding schools of ad
ministration, it will continue 
to offer advanced degrees 
in management and related 
areas.
Potential Cited
Paul C. Cross, president of 
Mellon Institute, stated, The 
recent growth of Mellon In
stitute has centered around 
its program in fundamental 
research. As a part of Car
negie University, the Insti
tute would be able to combine 
this role and its important 
task in industrially sponsored 
research with new contribu
tions in the field of graduate 
education. The potential of 
the new university offers 
greater opportunities for both 
institutions.
Tech president, H. Guyford 
Stever, added, The concept 
of Carnegie University is 
most challenging. The 
strength of the Mellon Insti
tute staff, its high quality 
programs and excellent facili
ties would contribute greatly 
to the new University as a 
center for studies in the basic 
sciences. As envisioned, the 
new universityprivate, lim
ited in enrollment, and em
phasizing liberal-professional 
educationwould have great 
impact on the region and the 
nation in all areas in which it 
engages in teaching, research, 
and in application to society. 
The proposed plan to create 
Carnegie University is the 
most promising occurrence in 
Techs 66-year history.
Staffs Joined
Officers of Mellon Institute 
would assume posts with
duties similar to those which 
they now hold. Senior re
search fellows would become 
faculty members of appro
priate rank and department; 
junior fellows and post-doc
toral fellows would become 
either junior faculty members 
or continue their full-time 
research appointments; and 
supporting technicians, and 
secretarial and maintenance 
staffs would become staff 
members of the new univer
sity.
Dr. Stever would serve as 
President of Carnegie Uni
versity, and the Carnegie 
Tech vice presidents, deans, 
faculty members, and staff 
members would retain their 
posts.
Boards To Vote
Details of the proposal are 
to be presented to the trustees 
of each institution at meet
ings to be held during the next 
few months. If approved by 
the boards, a plan will be 
submitted for approval to the 
Superintendent of Public In
struction in Harrisburg, and 
to the Court of Common Pleas 
of Allegheny County.
The creation of Carnegie 
University is aimed at broad
ening the scope of teaching 
and enhancing the quality of 
liberal professional education 
for which Tech has long been 
known, as well as increasing 
sharply the potential for re
search. The joining of Mellon 
Institute and Carnegie Tech 
into Carnegie University 
would further advance the 
cooperative efforts of these 
neighboring institutions as 
part of the Council of Higher 
Education of Pittsburgh,

BSR Fire Still Puzzle;
Duplex Considered
The results of a three-fold investigation of the fire 
which gutted the Beta Sigma Rho (BSR) fraternity house 
last April 26 were revealed this week by R. D. Strathmeyer, 
Carnegie Tech vice-president for business affairs, in re
sponse to a Tartan inquiry.
Three investigations, conducted 
independently by. Carnegie Tech, 
Pittsburghs Bomb and Arson 
Squad, which investigates routine
ly all major fires in the city, and 
the insurance company with which 
the school deals, each confirmed 
conclusively the fire departments 
preliminary report that the fire 
v/as not caused by any faculty 
utility installation such as gas or 
electricity.
The blaze, according to Strath
meyer, apparently broke out in 
what the fraternity called its 
pledge room. Evidence indicated 
that some flammable material 
speeded the passage of the flames 
through the house. Strathmeyer 
added, however, that this room 
had been used for storage of such 
flammables as paints.
The investigators findings with 
regard to the actual cause of the 
fire were inconclusive: In talking 
to the brothers of BSR, and in 
examining the interior of the 
house, no one was able to ascer
tain or trace the ultimate origin 
of the blaze.
Matter Settled 
Neither the Bomb and Arson 
Squad nor the insurance com
pany, however, are actively pur
suing the matter further. Strath
meyer claimed moreover, that an 
equitable and satisfactory cash 
settlement had been reached by 
Carnegie Tech with the insurance 
company.
Strathmeyer extended his com
mendations to the fraternity 
brothers who, he said, cooperated 
closely with the three investigating 
agencies.
When questioned regarding fu
ture housing facilities for BSR, 
now located in the old Canterbury 
House on Margaret Morrison 
Street, Strathmeyer revealed that 
an estimated expenditure of $75,-
000 to $85,000 would have been 
necessary to restore the house, 
and claimed that a new and bet
ter facility could be constructed 
at lower cost to the school. The 
house, which in its gutted condi
tion constituted an attractive 
nuisance, was therefore razed this, 
week.
New Duplex 
Carnegie Tech will begin joint 
planning this fall with the fra
ternities for additional fraternity 
housing, not only for BSR, but 
also for other chapters not housed 
in duplexes, specifically Sigma Nu 
ai\d Kappa Sigma. Strathmeyer 
has also begun negotiations with
1 heta Xi, whose property is not 
owned by the school.
Carnegie Techs goal is to pro'iuce a design which first will 
provide the functional features 
rtich fraternities require, recog
nizing the deficiencies of the duI exes, and second will not be so 
^similar to the duplexes that 
se chapters housed in the new 
(ilities will possess no real or 
presumed advantage over the 
others.

Filling ten empty seats in Student Senate will be the chief order of business at the 
Senates first meeting of the year next Tuesday, Sept. 20. The meeting, at 4:30 p.m. in 
the Wherrett Room, is open to all students.
In last springs election Joe Orens, senior electrical engineer, was elected president 
of the Student Body and Lloyd Patross, senior in Industrial Management, was elected 
vice-president. Thirty-one delegates to the Senate, one for every 100 undergraduate stu
dents, were also to be chosen, but only 21 nomination petitions were received. Thus the 
election of delegates failed to materialize, and everyone who submitted a nomination 
was automatically elected to Congress.
The biggest representational deFaculty and Students Cordially Invited to Dedication
Dr. John C. Warner, president 
of Carnegie Tech from 1950 to 
1965, will speak tomorrow after
noon at the formal dedication of 
the building named after him 
Warner Hall, Carnegie Techs 
new administration building. Dr. 
Warner will talk on The Role 
of the Administration in the Uni
versity in ceremonies beginning 
at 2:30 p.m.
The completion of Warner Hall 
completes Carnegie Techs tenyear plan for campus develop
ment which was begun in 1957 
during Dr. Warners tenure. Near
ly all of Techs administrative 
offices are housed in the new
building. Floor plans of all six 
floors and the concourse are re
printed on page three of todays 
TARTAN.
Construction of the building was 
made possible by a gift from the 
late Mrs. Alan M. Scaife and her 
family. The Scaifes also donated 
funds for the Alan M. Scaife Hall 
of Engineering, home of the com
putation center, which was dedi
cated in 1962.
Mr. Robert Finlay of Westport, 
Connecticut, a granddaughter of 
Andrew Carnegie, will be among 
the notable guests at tomorrows 
dedication. It will be her first 
visit to Carnegie Tech.

start of the academic year is a special time for all of you, and 
I want to give you a warm welcome to the campus.
To you students who are here for the first time, may 
I say that we are pleased that you have chosen to come to 
Carnegie Tech. I hope that some of the strangeness has already 
worn off and that you are beginning to feel at home here. As 
you begin the next phase of your education, you have the best 
wishes of all of us for an intellectual experience on the 
campus that will be enjoyable and rewarding to you in every 
way.
And to you who are returning, not only do we welcome you 
back, but we hope that this year may prove even better than 
last, both in personal development and professional accomplish
ment.
Sincerely yours.

Frosh To Hear 
Faculty Pairs 
In Discussions
A major facet of Orienta
tion Week will present Car
negie Tech freshmen with 
an impressive slate of Sem
inars in the Search for Unity 
in Contemporary Thought. 
Based on a very similar an
nual program given each De
cember for outstanding local 
high school students, the 
seminars allow close contact 
between pairs of faculty 
members and small groups 
of freshmen.
Vice-President for Planning Rob
ert J. Kibbee introduced the sem
inar program at a freshman class 
assembly September 11 with an 
address Aspirations, Expecta
tions, and Reality.
Admitting that the class of 1970 
has become the most talked-to 
freshman class in recent years, 
Kibbee examined the college 
mystique comprised of institu
tional aspirations as opposed to 
student expectations. He under
lined three major resultant con
flicts between faculty and stu
dents: professional versus teach
ing motivations for teachers, fa
culty demands for quality work 
versus students extracurricular 
interests which occasionally con
flict wwith academic interests, 
and institutional conservatism 
versus student activism which pro
tests dispassionate study, never 
passionate action.
Kibbee urged students to fight 
for what you think is right; re
member, the Carnegie revolution 
needs you.
Complementing these conflicts, 
the seminars will search for com
mon elements of various discip
lines in four general aspects: 
creativity, esthetic values, pro
cesses, and structural values. 
Seminar topics range from di
rect comparisons such as The 
Art of Physics and the Science of 
Music to the disturbing question 
Is College Useful? which will 
be discussed by Engineering and 
Science Dean William W. Mullins 
and Associate Professor of His
tory, Richard L. Schoenwald.

Editorial
A Superb Example
One of the first impressions a freshman receives of 
Carnegie Tech and the people composing its community is 
obtained via orientation. In previous years, freshman ori
entation has given an erroneous, or at best, an incomplete 
view of the university.
This year, Orientation 66, as freshman orientation week 
was called, has been a superb example of how imaginative 
students, administrators, and faculty members in a coopera
tive effort can conceive and execute a program designed to 
make orientation a meaningful experience for freshmen.
The whole program was structured to give freshmen a 
unifying awareness of himself, his classmates, the faculty, 
administration, and the resources and facilities within this 
community for continuing growth and learning.
Three of the unique and probably most auspicious 
events in Orientation 66 were the freshman class convoca
tion, the seminars in the Search for Unity in Contemporary 
Thought, and the recreational and entertainment programs. 
For the first time in many years, the freshman class convo
cation, the official opening of freshman orientation, utilized 
the traditions and color which are a part of the university. 
The freshmen were given a four year preview of the pomp 
and ceremony of commencement, which symbolized, in part, 
the seriousness of the business of education. Secondly, the 
seminars, a repeat of a similar program given last spring, 
provide not only an introduction to the ideas of the uni
versity, but present an intellectual and artistic approach to 
several disciplines. Finally, the opportunities to meet fel
low freshmen and upperclassmen were magnified through 
a complete program of recreation and entertainment, rang
ing from the freshman picnic and volleylball to a coffee 
house and folk music.
With individual students as its recipients, perhaps Oriantation 66 did not completely achieve all its objectives of 
providing the stimuli for some thoughtful personal assess
ment of the university, its ideas and goals, and the intellec
tual and social growth it provides and stimulates. But is has 
been an unqualified success in its attempts, and has laid a 
firm foundation and set high standards for future orienta
tion weeks.
The chairman of Orientation 66, Bernie Dobroski, jun
ior music major, has done an outstanding job in planning, 
coordinating, and carrying out the program, and has per
formed a great service to the Carnegie Tech community.

Tech: From Early Times
The majority of Carnegie Tech students know little or nothing about the history 
of Carnegie Tech. The information below gives the reader a chance to quickly fill this 
gap if he so desires.
Andrew Carnegie first made known his desire to found a technical school in Pitts
burgh in November, 1900. At a banquet attended by the mayor of Pittsburgh and other 
officials, Carnegie read a letter of his intentions.
The schools motto, My Heart
Is in The Work, was later ex
tracted from the text of this let
ter. Carnegies offer was official
ly accepted by City Council in 
January, 1901, and definite plans 
were initiated. In February, 1903, 
the site for the campus was se
lected, and 32 acres were pur
chased at a cost of $350,000. A 
board of Trustees had been or
ganized by this time, and it elec
ted Arthur A. Hammerschlag as 
director of the school.
Hamerschlag was truly a selfeducated man, having no normal 
education past high school. At the 
time of his appointment he was a 
well-known figure in the field of 
industrial education in New York.
As director (the title was 
changed to President in 1918) it 
was his job to supervise the plan
ning, construction, and early years 
of the school.
Originally named Carnegie 
Technical Schools, the school was 
a vocationally oriented, consist
ing of four parts: The School of 
Science and Technology, School of 
Fine Applied Arts, School of Ap
prentices and Journeymen, and 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege. Three-year courses were of
fered in these departments until 
1910 when they were changed to 
four year courses as part of a 
movement to get the school re
cognized as a university. In 1912, 
the movement was completed, and 
the school received a charter from 
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl
vania. At the same time, the name 
was changed to Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology.
The actual construction of the 
school started in the spring of 
1903. Mrs. Hamerschlag turned 
the first spade of earth to signal 
the start of Industries Hall (now 
Porter Hall). Six months later, 
one end of the building completed, 
the first class entered. Due pri
marily to Andrew Carnegies good 
reputation, the school received ex
cellent publicity and hence over 
1000 applicants were received be
fore construction even started. 
Out of these, the charter class of 
120 students in engineering and 
architecture was chosen.
At first, classes for all four 
schools were held in industries 
Hall, and as other buildings were 
completed, the appropriate relo
cations were made. The MMCC 
building opened in 1907, followed 
by Engineering and Science (now 
D.H.) and the center section of
Fine Arts in 1912. The comer stone 
of Fine Arts contains a copy of the 
charter, a course catalogue (1912), 
a signed portrait of Andrew Carsomehow a students love letters 
negie, and it is rumored that 
were also included! Administra
tion Hall (now Baker Hall) was 
completed in 1914, the wings of 
Fine Arts in 1916, and first Mens 
dormitories, Boss and McGill, in 
1915. Scobel and Welch followed 
in 1918, and 1924, the gymnasium 
was opened.
Carnegie visited the school five 
times before his death in 1919. He 
was said to have been well pleas
ed with the progress the school 
had made, for by 1919 it had al
ready surpassed many of original 
expectations.
The brief summary has only 
touched upon some highlights of 
the early history of Carnegie Tech. 
For anyone interested further, The 
Story of Carnegie Tech by A. W. 
Tarbell can be found in the Hunt 
Library, and provides a complete 
picture of this era.
Dr. Horton Guyford Stever was 
the fifth president inaugurated at 
Carnegie Tech since the college 
was founded by Andrew Carnegie 
in 1900. Arthur Arton Hamer
schlag (1903-1922), Thomas Stock
ham Baker (1923-1935), Robert 
Ernest Doherty (1936-1950), and 
John Christian Warner 1950- 
1964) governed the college before 
him.
Dr. Hamerschlag was elected 
as Director of the college in 1903. 
At that time he was a well-known 
figure in New York City indus
trial education work. In 1918 his 
title was changed to President 
and under his guidance Carnegie 
Tech was created physically and 
established itself educationally. 
Withdrawing from his education
al interests in 1922, Dr. Hamer
schlag took up his private prac
tice as an engineering consul
tant. Soon after the first presi
dents death in 1927 a commem
orative speech was given by his 
life-long friend, Dr. Frederick 
Paul Keppel, then president of 
the Carnegie Corporation and 
former assistant secretary of 
war Woodrow Wilson. Said Dr. 
Keppel: In many ways it (the ap
pointment of President Hamer
schlag) was a strange choice. He 
was young, he was untried in 
work of that kind, his formal 
educational preparation had been 
slight. But Andrew Carnegie, 
among his other great qualities, 
had the quality of picking men 
... I appreciate the opportunity
this occasion offers me to pay tri
bute to the memory, not of a 
paragon of all academic virtues, 
but of a brilliant mind, a pic
turesque and stimulating per
sonality, and to me of a very 
dear friend.
Thomas Stockham Baker as
sumed the presidency of Carnegie 
Tech in 1923. The principle 
achievements of his administra
tion were, according to Tarbells 
The Story of Carnegie Tech, the 
establishment of a definite re
search program, the sponsorship 
of three international coal con
ferences and the Coal Research 
Laboratory, a closer relationship 
and understanding between the 
institution and the community, 
and the merger of the College of 
Industries with the College of 
Engineering.
Robert E. Doherty assumed the 
presidency of Carnegie Tech in 
1936.
In a 1964 farewell address to 
students, Dr. John Christian War
ner said this about him: In four
teen years, although his efforts 
were hampered by our years of 
war, Dr. Doherty had converted 
a know-what undergraduate pro
gram into a know-what and a 
know-why program. He had 
sown the seeds of high quality, 
and they were beginning to flow
er. President Doherty had a vis
ion of Carnegie as a first-class 
educational institution and as a 
center of learning ... by revolu
tionizing the undergraduate pro
gram, firmly establishing the im
portance of humanities and so
cial sciences in the education of 
professional men and women, 
and by placing a proper empha
sis upon quality, Doherty had 
moved Carnegie Tech into the 
forefront as an undergraduate in
stitution in the professional fields 
represented here.
Dr. Warner, himself, came to 
Carnegie Tech in 1926 and quick
ly went through the ranks be 
coming professor and head of 
the chemistry department, a posi
tion he held until 1949 when he 
was appointed vice president and 
president-elect. He also served 
as dean of graduate studies from 
1945 until 1950.
During his administration, Car
negie Tech experienced its great
est physical growth. Fourteen 
buildings were constructed. A de
velopment program, which was 
begun ^n 1957 with a goal of 
$29,000,000, had raised $26,000,-
000 of that total in the fall oi 
1964. Dr. Warner also raised fa
culty salaries over 100 percent 
during his term.

Leaders Explain Activities 
Of Major Student Groups
Ovens Invites 
Participation 
In Activities
by JOSEPH ORENS
President of the Student Body
During the past week you have 
been welcomed to Tech by many 
administrators, faculty, and stu
dents. As President of the Student 
Body, I would like to add my 
welcome.
Your years at Tech can be some 
of your most profitable, but it is 
your responsibility to use them to 
advantage. Tech has many riches 
to offer youboth scholastic and 
extracurricular  but you must 
strive for them before you can 
ever hope to reap their benefits. 
We all realize that your primary 
reason for attending college is 
scholastic, but those of you who 
consider this the sole reason are 
in danger of squandering many 
of Techs riches. There is an ex
tracurricular activity for every
one through which you can de
velop many of your latent tal
ents. With a little time and in
vestigation you can find an acti
vity suited to your interests. Cer
tainly time for these activities is 
at a premium, but with a little 
care in budgeting your studying, 
there will definitely be time avail
able.
College should be the time when 
you form not only many of your 
educational philosophies, but al
so many of your political and 
moral ones. The habits you form 
now will tend to last throughout 
your lifetime. However you uti
lize your years at Tech, I hope 
they prove to be as stimulating 
and rewarding as mine are.
AWS Exercises 
Most Freedom 
Yet Delegated
by MARILYN BLITZ 
President, AWS
On behalf of the Association of 
Women Sturents (AWS) of Car
negie Institute of Technology, I 
would like to take this opportun
ity to welcome back all the up
perclassmen and to extend my 
greetings to the newcomers on 
the Tech campus.
The year promises to be excit
ing as it will be the first full year 
as an organization affiliated with 
the National AWS. Our member
ship with the organization is re
warding as it affords us the op
portunity to establish contact with 
colleges and universities through
out the United States and helps 
us see what the role of women 
is, on campuses throughout the 
nation.
All women enrolled at Carnegie 
Tech are members of AWS. Those 
woman living in Morewood Gar
dens will find an improved and 
more comfortable dormitory. Colo
nial Manor has been moving into 
action to provide the best oncampus apartment living avail
able and commuters will find both 
of these housing structures avail
able to them at all times.
AWS has plans to make 1966-67 
a richly rewarding year. Never 
before have the women on this 
campus been given so much free
dom and trust. The AWS is a work
ing body, always trying to better 
the position of the Carnegie wom
an; to provide for her activities 
such as mixers, its annual art 
sale and exhibit, and the oppor
tunity to conduct its own govern
ing and judicial body. We will 
begin the year with a fashion 
show, Saturday, September 17 at 
1 p.m. in Skibo sponsored by 
G i m b e 1 s in conjunction with 
Seventeen Magazine. Live enter
tainment will be provided by 
Harold Betters and his band. 
Come, and bring your friends.
The Executive ouncil of Aws 
is moving quickly to make you as 
comfortable and happy as possible 
in your four years at Tech.
Panhel Offers 
Wide Variety 
Of Experiences
by NELLY PFIESTER
President, Panhellenic Council
Panhellenic Council, in the name 
of the seven sororities, welcomes 
the class of 70 to Carnegie Tech.
One of the many experiences 
offered by Tech is an opportunity 
to explore and participate in di
verse activities. As one becomes 
integrated into our college, one 
discovers and joins groups of 
other students, sharing interests 
and working toward common 
goals. For a woman student, a 
sorority could be one of these 
groups. Each sorority has indi
vidual characteristics that set it 
apart from the others. The pro
cess of member selection, known 
as rushing is designed to bring 
together young women of similar 
interests who will sustain and 
carry forward the traditions of 
the group. Just as the sororities 
select those students who appear 
to have like interests, the students 
who are being rushed should give 
serious consideration to selecting 
the group with which they have 
the most in common. Sorority 
membership, well chosen, can 
provide a most enriching experi
ence.
Again, hearty greetings to the 
freshmen. We, the Panhellenic 
Council, look forward to meeting 
each of you in person.
CFP Stresses 
Association 
Among Students
by ROBERT COOPER 
President, CFP
The Council of Fraternity Presi
dents, on behalf of the fraternity 
system at Carnegie Tech, extends 
its welcome to the Class of 1970! 
Carnegie Tech, as its college coun
terparts throughout the United 
States, can be a challenging and 
worthwhile experience. It is an 
exposure to many personalities, 
ideas, and ways of living. It is 
combination of interactionsmen
tal and socialto produce a bet

portunity and a responsibility.
Orientation week seeks to as
sociate you more completely with 
the campus community, tending 
to buffer the transition between 
high school and college. Through 
the series of activities organized 
during that week you have begun 
to accustom yourself to the col
lege experience. The fraternity 
system wishes to help you in any 
way possible, to make this im
portant transition i your life. To 
meet you, talk to you, and in

Mullins, New Dean of E & S, 
Sees Social Responsibility
Dr. William W. Mullins, form
er head of the Department of 
Metallurgy and Materials Science, 
became Dean of the College of 
Engineering and Science on Sep
tember 1 after six years at Car
negie Tech.
Mullins succeeds B. Richard 
Teare, who has been appointed 
Institute Professor of Engineering 
and will continue to teach at Car
negie Tech.
It is his philosophy that engin
eers should look more at the so
cial and practical needs of man
kind.that there should be a 
closer relationship between the 
engineer and the sociologist. In 
the past, engineers have been 
chiefly concerned with problems 
of man against nature, such as 
building dams, leveling moun
tains, invading space. He feels 
that now engineers should be con
cerned also with man against 
the problems arising out of the 
man-made world, problems such 
as urban development, pollution, 
automation.
Predicting a bright future for 
engineering as a profession, Dr. 
Mullins said, More and more re
liance must be put upon engin
eers as our society becomes more 
and more complex. He has stated 
that engineers can make an even 
greater contribution to society 
than they have in the past, but 
that in addition there is a need 
to emphasize the ethical respon
sibility of engineers and scien
tists.
More Arts, Humanities
To implement his philosophy of 
social responsibility, Dr. Mullins 
said he hopes to give Techs en
gineering and science students 
more exposure to related dis
ciplines on the campus. We need 
to explore further the possibilities 
of taking advantage of Techs 
strong economics and administra
tion areas, its strong humanities 
and social science areas, as well 
as its outstanding fine arts school 
in developing more concern and 
appreciation for the broad setting 
within which engineering op
erates, Mullins said.
For the engineering and science 
curriculum this means some 
changes in organizational struc
tures, both on and off the cam
pus. He proposed closer ties with 
industry through such things as 
special coordinating institutes.
Teaching Seminars
Characterizing the publish-orperish controversy as overrated
 good scholars automatically 
publishand not detrimental to 
teaching, Dr. Mullins still noted 
a need to stimulate and en
courage outstanding teaching. He 
said he is considering seminars 
on teaching methods by acknow
ledged leaders in the art.
Dr. Mullins received his bache
lor of philosophy, his Masters 
degree and his doctorate in phy
sics from the University of Chi
cago.
Before joining Carnegie Techs 
faculty, he was employed by
you the opportunity to see the 
fraternity system and meet its 
members.
Rush tours begin September 23 
and .will continue on September
25. These tours will take you to 
see all of the fraternity houses 
and begin to talk with fraternity 
members. All 12 houses will be 
open for your inspection. Later 
in the semester further fraterni
ty-sponsored activities will be 
held: a block party on Oct. 1, a 
smoker in November, and a De
cember rush party.
Dr. William W. Mullins
Westinghouse Research Labora
tories, where he did basic re
search in metal physics and later 
was appointed advisory physicist 
in charge of a group studying 
metallic surfaces.
Dr. Mullins is a member of 
numerous organizations in his 
field. He is the author of many 
papers, and has been honored as 
the recipient of a Guggenheim 
Fellowship and Fulbright Grant, 
University of Paris and the Mat
thew son Gold Medal, American In
stitute of Mining, Metallurgical 
and Petroleum Engineers.
Financial Aid 
Broadened 
By New Jobs
More than a third of the student 
body will be employed in parttime jobs this semester, estimates 
Carnegie Techs new financial aid 
director, Peter Nachtwey. Posi
tions will be available with the 
food service, skibo, the library, 
scientific laboratories, .mainte
nance crews, and individual de
partments although all appoint
ments should come through the 
financial aid office.
Payment will be made through 
the regular part-time student em
ployment budget and the College 
Work-Study Program. The latter, 
created under the Higher Educa
tion Act of 1966, will finance ap
proximately 200 openings, some 
of these with the Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity projects.
No student may work more than 
15 hours a week under either 
payment program; the average 
work-time is from 10 to 12 hours. 
Minimum wages have been set 
at $1.25 an hour, and some pay 
more than $2.25. A state employ
ment tax of $10 must be deducted 
from salaries of those who have 
not already paid it.
In addition to handling on-campus employment, the Financial 
Aid Office maintains a listing of 
off-campus jobs. In such cases, 
students must negotiate with their 
would-be employers as to hours 
and wages.
Those interested should visit the 
Financial Aid Office on the sec
ond floor of Administration Hall.
Stever Selects Johnson 
For Development Post
Mr. John G. Johnson, a Car
negie Tech graduate and current
ly Vice-President for Financial 
Development at Butler University 
in Indianapolis, Indiana, assumed 
the position of Vice-President for 
Development at Carnegie Tech on 
September 1. Johnson succeeds
H. Russell Bintzer, who has ac
cepted a similar post at California 
Institute of Technology in Pasa
dena, California.
In announcing J o h n s o ns ap
pointment, Carnegie Tech presi
dent H. Guyford Stever stressed 
the need for private universities 
to obtain increasing support from 
alumni, corporations, foundations, 
and interested individuals. Mr. 
Bintzer has given us strong lead
ership in this area since the start 
of our development program al
most ten years ago, he said.
Quality private education has 
long been an essential part of this 
countrys educational progress, 
and the appointment of someone 
on a high administrative level, 
whose main concern is planning 
for future resources, guarantees 
the continuance of such progress. 
In Mr. Johnson, I believe we have 
found a young, yet experienced 
administrator, who will greatly 
enhance our programs or corpora
tion with those sectors of our so
ciety most concerned with private 
education.
A native of Irwin, Pa., Mr. 
Johnson served in the U.S. Army 
artillery, European Theater from 
1943 to 1946 and enrolled at Tech 
following his discharge. He re
ceived a bachelors degree in 
1949 and spent five years in indus
try before returning to his alma 
mater in 1954 as associate secre
tary o fthe Carnegie Tech Alumni 
Federation. He was named execu
tive secretary of the Federation 
in July, 1958, and held that posi
tion until 1960 when he was named
John G. Johnson
associate director of the Ameri
can Alumni Council.
Mr. Johnson has been in his 
present position at Butler Uni
versity since 1964, and is respon
sible for directing the activities 
of the alumni office, public rela
tions, and all fund-raising pro
grams.

Food Director Says
Satisfy Student Needs
Giving the students what they want will be the key
note of Carnegie Techs new food plan, according to Mr. L. 
E. Price, newly-hired director of food service.
Part-time student workers, ------------------------------------------------
Class of 70 
Slightly Smaller: 
822 Register
many of them in fairly respon
sible positions, will fill food ser
vice jobs formerly held by full
time outside employees, and an 
enlarged student congress advisory 
committee will have a voice in 
menu planning.
See snack bar story, page 11,
and student congress story, 
page 1.
Last year Stouffers Food Service 
Management, Inc. handled the 
buying and serving of food in the 
Skibo cafeteria, snack bar, and 
More wood Gardens cafeteria. 
Carnegie Tech has terminated 
Stouffers contract and will now 
control these functions itself 
through Mr. Price.
Price claims the quality of the 
food will be maintained, and the 
quantity will be increased. The 
size of meat portions, for exam
ple, has been increased from three 
and one-half ounces per meal to 
five ounces. Cost of a food con
tract for dorm residents has gone 
up from 210 dollars a semester to 
235 dollars a semseter.
One hundred fifty part-time stu
dents will be needed to supple
ment the 122 full-time employees 
-of food service. All student work
ers must be on the contract food 
plan, and most will receive $1.35 
an hour. Mrs. Price has calculated 
that a student working 12 hours a 
we * will be able to pay his com
plete board fee out of his wages.
The food service will also use 
several salaried students in man
agerial positions. One student, 
Bill Gorley, has already been 
hired as student director of stu
dent employment for men. His 
job is recruiting and scheduling 
part-time male employees.
Salaried positions still open to 
students are student director of 
employment for women, a head 
waiter and head waitress to han
dle catering for special events, 
four student supervisors of dish
washing, six student supervisors 
of line serving, a student recipe 
cost control supervisor, and a 
student raw food cost control su
pervisor.
Applications for any of the 
above jobs can be made at the 
Food Service Office, which is on 
the second floor of Skibo, direct
ly above the information desk.
This year 822 Carnegie 
Tech freshmen, compared to 
894 last year, began classes 
Wednesday, with 445 in En
gineering and Science, 225 in 
Fine Arts, and 152 in Mar
garet Morrison.
The biggest freshman depart
ment of E&S is electrical engin
eering, with 82 registrants. Other 
department enrollments range 
from 71 in math to eight in metal
lurgy and four in biological sci
ences. The E&S freshmen total is 
down from 478 last fall.
In Fine Arts, 90 painting and de
sign students and 34 architects 
make up part of the 225 fresh
men, as opposed to 237 a year 
ago.
Nearly half (67) of MMCCs 
152 freshmen are majoring in hu
manities along with 27 in home 
economics and 26 in natural sci
ences. Last year MMCC fresh
men numbered 179.
The decrease in class size from 
last year to this year despite in
creasing applications does not re
flect a change in Carnegie Tech 
admissions policies, but rather is 
due to the difficulty of predicting 
class sizes on the basis of admis
sions. Mr. David J. Masoner, As
sistant Director of Admissions, 
sees such predictions as a big 
guessing game in which the actual 
class may be larger or smaller 
than expected by as many as 50 
students.
Further freshmen information 
as received during registration 
will be processed soon by Manage
ment Information Service.
Senate Seeks To Fill Vacancies
(Continued from Page 1)
fore finals by problems in draft
ing a new constitution. Lack of 
publicity was also blamed.
Orens and Patross have urged 
freshn n to attempt to fill some 
of the empty seats.
Several methods have been 
proposed for picking more dele
gates. One is to hold another gen
eral all-campus election with 
freshmen eligible. Another is to 
accept and approve nomination 
petitions from some upperclass
men who have contacted Patross 
and expressed interest in the 
Senate since spring, then hold a 
freshmen class election to fill the 
seats that are still left.
Since elections are traditional
ly held late in the school year, 
this will be the first time incom
ing freshmen have had a chance 
to be represented in the Student 
Senate.
Bylaws Vague
Another major job ahead of 
the present delegates is the re
writing of the bylaws and stand
ing rules of the Student. Senate. 
When the new constitution was 
composed ,the bylaws were only 
partially defined. One thing left 
unclear in the bylaws as they 
stand is the exact procedure for 
choosing members of external 
committees.
Many of the external commit
tees have yet to be staffed. The 
Executive Council of Student 
Government, composed of leaders 
of governing bodies on campus, 
selects chairmen of external com
mittees.
Committees which have already 
been assembled are the Fresh
man Orientation Committee 
(Bernard Dobrosky, chairman),

Freshman Camp Posts 
Challenges of 1970,s
Some 330 dink-topped Carnegie Tech freshmen received 
their first close view of classmates, upperclassmen, faculty, 
and administration last Thursday through Saturday at 
Camp Lutherlyn near Butler, Pa.
Co- chairmen Beverly Philoff sky and Richard Londergan, sen
iors, humanities and physics re
spectively, began work in spring 
1966 to set up program and enter
tainment committees and to se
lect upperclass counselors for 
camp. Sports and social activi
ties, discussions and panels on 
Art and Automation in 1975, 
and a visit from Carnegie Tech 
I president H. Guyford Stever gave 
freshmen and upperclassmen 
alike a chance to meet each other 
and consider their plans for the 
future.
City Problems
Thursday evening keynote 
speaker David N. Lewis, Andrew 
Mellon Professor of Architec
ture and Urban Design, discussI ed the challenge of urban prob
lems in the face of vastly ex
panding population. City growth 
in the next forty years, Lewis 
said, must equal all that has 
taken place up to now since the 
landing of the first settlers in 
America.
Lewis also underlined the 
challenge of obsolescence of city 
facilities and the drastic split 
between have and have-not 
citizens. In solving these prob
lems, he said, there is the op
portunity for great imaginative 
and catalytic forces to develop 
the huge potential of technology 
as built up by the pressure of 
circumstances.
Viewing Carnegie Tech as a 
modem microcosm, Lewis urged 
 freshmen to take advantage of 
the broadness and depth of op
portunity at Carnegie Tech in 
planning for the future.
Freshmen Answer
______The problems pointed up in
Lewiss closing comments formed 
a basis for Friday morning panel 
presentations involving camp 
counselors and faculty. In sub
sequent discussions, smaller 
groups of freshmen expressed 
their own views and considered 
those of others in the light of 
the previous presentations.
Individual views of upperclass
men as presented in short state
ments of their outlooks for them
selves in the future complement
ed the morning program by al
lowing freshmen to consider the 
roles of individuals in the future.
A coffee house, square dancing, 
and The Critters closed the 
night and provided relaxation 
from the difficult problems of 
Who am I, and where am I 
going?
Dr. Robert Morgan, Director of 
Carnegie Techs Counseling Cen
ter, summarized camp activities 
and aims at a final Saturday 
morning meeting. Morgan com
pared his observations of fresh
men with those of upperclass
men by noting that a good ex
ample of a complacent group 
with firm plans is a group of 
freshmen, while seniors consti
tute an ideal example of disturb
ed, undecided individuals. Re
emphasizing Lewis conception of 
the Carnegie Tech microcosm, 
Morgan expressed the hope for 
unity as well as diversity on the 
Carnegie Tech campus.
At the close of the three-day 
program, the campers returned 
to rejoin the other two-thirds of 
the freshmen in orientation pro
grams which will continue 
through Saturdays Seminars in 
The Search for Unity in Contemporary Thought.____________

Pittsburgh Features
Sports, Entertainment
by KEN LUTZ
The-out-of-city freshman wishing to take advantage of 
what little spare time he has might do well to avail himself 
of the many entertainment and cultural activities which 
Pittsburgh has to offer.
Within easy walking distance, 
just a few blocks down Forbes 
Ave. is Schenley Plaza, a large 
parking area surrounded by a 
number of notable buildings. On 
one side, situated right on Forbes 
is Carnegie Institute, housing the 
main branch of the public library, 
the museum of natural history, 
and the museum of art, in addi
tion to a lecture hall and a mu
sic hall. Practically next door is 
the new Henry Clay Frick Fine 
Arts Building, with an excellent 
permanent collection and frequent 
special exhibits. Directly across 
the Plaza is the Stephen Foster 
Memorial Building, dedicated to 
the Father of American Folk
songs. Burying the Foster Me
morial in its shadow is the Uni
versity of Pittsburghs Cathedral 
of Learning, the tallest college 
building in the world, with se
veral floors of Nationality Rooms, 
each completely furnished in au
thentic style of a particular coun
try. Close at hand is Syria Mosque, 
home of the Pittsburgh Opera and 
world-acclaimed Pittsburgh Sym
phony Orchestra, to be conducted 
in its fortieth year by Dr. William 
Steinberg. The symphony season 
opens next Thursday night, and 
the National Touring Company of 
the Metropolitan Opera will per
form La Boheme on October 1.
Full Sports Seasons
(For sport enthusiasts, round
ing out Schenley Plaza is Forbes 
Field, home of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who still have three re
maining home games against the 
San Francisco Giants in their 
battle for the National League 
pennant. Also in Oakland is Pitt 
Stadium, which hosts the Pitt 
Panthers and the professional 
Pittsburgh Steelers, both of whom 
open their 1966 seasons this week. 
Around the middle of October, the 
American Hockey Leagues Pitts
burgh Hornets take the ice at the 
start of their 70-game schedule at 
the Civic Arena, which boasts the 
worlds largest moveable dome. 
Also at the Arena, located in the 
Uptown section of Pittsburgh, 
will be the world premiere of the 
1966 Ice Capades in September.
For those who would rather 
participate than watch, Schenley 
Park offers tennis courts, riding 
stables, and a well-kept public 
golf course.
Shadyside is the alleged Green
wich Village of Pittsburgh, with 
numerous art galleries, coffee 
houses, and night spots. Each 
year many performers make their 
debuts in this section of the 
Renaissance city.
The Pittsburgh Playhouse, lo
cated at Craft Avenue and Ham
let Street in Oakland, is the com
munity live theatre, with a new 
resident acting company now be
ing established. Subscriptions are 
being sought for the Theatre Guild, 
which will bring touring Broad
way shows to one of the Down
town Theatres. Squirrel Hill up 
Forbes Avenue away from down
town, has four movie theaters.
Ticket and schedule informa
tion on all these Pittsburgh events 
will be found in upcoming issues 
of the TARTAN, in the column 
called This Week in Pittsburgh. 
The Pittsburgh Chamber of Com
merce (391-3400) is also more 
than willing to furnish such in
formation. Public transit sched
ules are available from the Port 
Authority of Allegheny County,
Grades Policy
(Continued from Page 4) 
ditional failure of such a nature 
that the student will be given an 
opportunity to bring his work up 
to passing level without repeat
ing the course. An X grade may 
be raised only to a D grade.
I and X grades must be re
moved from the students trans
cripts by the end of the follow
ing semester. This has not always 
been followed through. To en
sure removal of I and X grades 
in the future the following pro
cedure will be adopted on a cam
pus-wide basis:
When an I or X grade is sub
mitted to the registrar, it must 
be accompanied by a carbon copy 
of a memorandum addressed to 
the Dean of the Division in which 
the student enrolled.
This memo must be signed by 
the instructor giving the con
ditional grade and contersigned 
by his department head. The 
memo must clearly indicate why 
the grade is being given and what 
must be done on the part of the 
student to remove it. Unless the 
instructor further explains why 
the student cannot satisfy these 
requirements before the end of 
the next semester he is in at
tendance, the grade will auto
matically revert to an R at that 
time if no change-of-grade card 
is submitted.
The registrar will provide lists 
of students who have I and X 
grades and these will be sent to 
department heads shortly before 
grading periods to remind in
structors that change-of-g r a d e 
cards must be submitted. Depart
ment heads will see that changeof-grade cards are returned for 
all students receiving I and X in
cluding those who should receive 
R.
Field Hockey Is 
WARA Opener
Members of the Womens Ath
letic and Recreation Association 
began their years work at the 
Freshmen Sports Picnic. It is 
hoped that the willingness of the 
freshmen to meet each other and 
partake in some recreation before 
classes begin is some indication 
that the freshmen women will 
join the upperclassmen in recrea
tional and athletic activities 
throughout the year. Elaine Bykowski, WARA president said that 
Lack of participation is the big
gest problem we have to face this 
year. Last year, only 79 coeds 
actively participated in six dif
ferent activities  less than 14 
percent of the residents of Morewood Gardens alone.
The activities planned for the 
coming year include field hoc
key, volleyball, basketball, Tarquans (synchronized swimming), 
swimming, tennis and horseback 
riding. Volleyball and swimming 
are being expanded to both intercolligate and intramural activi
ties. Other activities may be 
added after the results have been 
tabulated from a questionnaire 
completed by the women register
ing for gym classes. Miss Dorothy 
Kanrich, WARA advisor, has in
dicated that Senior Life Saving 
may also be added to the recrea
tional activities. It is hoped that 
all Tech women, including com
muters, will participate in at 
least one WARA activity this 
year.
Boosted Orientation Draws 
Enthusiastic Participation
An expanded 1966 Freshman Orientation program aimed 
at aiding students to adjust to their new environments and 
to consider the opportunities extended to them by 
Carnegie Tech began formally last Saturday. Planned 
events continue through the September 24 football game 
with Wooster College.
Following the return on Sep
tember 10 of one-third of the 
class from Freshman Camp, con
vocations for each of Carnegie 
Techs three colleges were held 
at 1:45 pm. Dr. Everard M. Wil
liams of the College of Engineer
ing and Science, Dean Erwin R. 
Steinberg of Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College, and Dean Nor
man. L. Rice of the College of 
Fine Arts addressed freshmen 
and their parents. President and 
Mrs. Stever and department 
heads, received freshmen at 3 pm.
A convocation showing the 
ceremony of a commencement 
climaxed the Saturday program 
as a full academic procession pre
ceded addresses by President 
Stever and Vice-President for 
Academic Affairs Edward R. 
Schatz.
Stever spoke on the goals of 
education  learning about the 
world and mans place in it, de
velopment of vocational skills, 
and development of the individ
ual  and the responsibility of 
the university in promoting these 
goals.
For the first two goals, Stever 
said, Carnegie Tech takes di
rect responsibility, not only in
providing you as good an edu
cation as possible . . ., but it in
sists on measuring your progress 
toward those goals as well. De
velopment of the individual, 
however, is entirely your own 
responsibility. Carnegie Tech 
provides as far as possible the 
means with which to facilitate 
this goal because of its impor
tance, according to Stever.
Following some humerous retion is something pleasant that 
happened last year that almost 
everybody hopes will happen 
again), Schatz outlined the tra
dition of academic excellence at 
Carnegie Tech and urged fresh
men to enhance this custom by 
taking pride in their work and 
setting high levels of aspiration.
An unprecedented Sunday 
morning attendence which over
flowed the Skibo breakfast spon
sored by the Committee on Re
ligious Affairs gave students a 
look at contemporary religion 
and ceremonies. Similar enthusi
astic turnout marked the after
noon class picnic.
In the 
weekend,
final event of the 
Vice-President for
Planning Robert J. Kibbee in
troduced the September 17 sem
inars in the Search for Unity in 
Contemporary Thought with a 
consideration of Aspirations, Ex
pectations, and Reality (see ar
ticle on seminars, page 1).
College Activities
Freshmen were introduced to 
numerous extracurricular oppor
tunities at the Monday after
noon Activities Fair which fea
tured Carnegie Techs major pub
lications, service groups, and stu
dent clubs.
Fine Arts exhibits and recitals 
on Tuesday gave examples of the 
cultural opportunities made av
ailable by the work of the music, 
painting and design, architecture, 
and drama departments.
Orientation Week Committee 
Chairman, Bernard Dobroski, 
junior, music, feels that the 
greater scope of this years ac
tivities has not only helped to 
acquaint freshmen and parents 
with Carnegie Tech in general, 
but also has helped students to 
visualize more specifically the 
nature of the college experience 
facing them.
Developed by the Division of 
Student Affairs in cooperation 
with the academic deans and the 
Orientation Committee of Stu
dent Government, the orientation 
program was aided by Cwens and 
Scimitars, the Committee on Re
ligious Affairs, and Alpha Phi 
Omega, national service fraterni
ty.

Tartans Prepare For Season 
Opener Against Wooster
The Carnegie Tech football team will will open its 1966 season of September 24th 
at home against Wooster College. Included in last years 1-7 record was a 21-15 loss to 
Wooster on a 78 yard pass play with two minutes remaining. Although the Wolverines 
have 34 lettermen returning, including 19 out of its top 22, the Tartans themselves have a 
veteran offense, a crew of promising freshmen, and hopes for a full two-platoon system. 
With 45 candidates, including
17 returning lettermen, Coach 
Joe Gasparella said, We are 
starting at least as good as last 
year, and with the good freshmen 
we have we should improve. 
Tom Hubka, a junior quarter
back from Plainfield, N. J., who 
led Techs 1965 offense with 105 
completions out of 212 attempts, 
for 1,359 yards and 15 touch
downs, will be joined in the backfield by senioc running back Dave 
Gilchrist, sidelined for two years 
by injury and academic prob
lems. Gilchrist should help the 
running offense where we were 
weak last year, said Coach Gas
parella. Also returning will be 
flanker Rich Bell, a rugged junior 
from South Hills Catholic; Larry 
Getto; and Charley Zak, a deCoach Gasparella
fensive standout who is slated for 
some ball carrying chores this 
fall. In 1965, Tartan ballcarriers 
netted 847 yards on the ground, 
led by Smokey Merrill with 304 
yards for a 3.7 average, and 
sophomore Larry Getto with 272 
yards for a 3.9 average. Merrill 
and tight end Bill Coleman, who 
snagged 18 passes for 212 yards, 
are the only members missing 
from last years starting squad.
Along the line and from a de
fensive standpoint the Tech staff 
fingers Paul Beshenick, a 6-2 sen
ior who toes 205 solid pounds, as 
one of the be ter defensive tackles 
in small college football. More
over Bill Patula, a 200-pound twoyear letter winner at guard, draws 
praise from the coaches as prob
ably their outstanding lineman 
on offense.

Varsity Rifle and Pistol Team 
General Meeting for last years

College by way of Washington

Coach Gasparella said the big
gest improvement in 1966 should 
be in line depth, where he is
counting on help from such key 
freshmen as Dennis Morabito, 
Avonmore, Pa., expected to play 
guard; Eugene Giarneni, Penn

help from the freshmen. We

The coach said his biggest prob
lems this season will be finding 
and end to replace Coleman and 
two outside linebackers for de
fense.
Despite the fact that Techs 
football teams has won only five 
games in the last five years, 
Coach Gasparella faced the ap
proaching season optimistically. 
We have more depth and should 
be improved, he said. The rest 
depends on how improved the 
opponents are.

Tartan Sports Editor
This week, I am going to step away from the usual commentary 
on sports to speak about a man who served Carnegie Tech athletics 
for many years and in many capacities. The man I am speaking about 
is Mel Cratsley, who resigned as Athletic Director and Basketball 
coach this summer after 19 years of service as a coach to take the 
position of Athletic Director at Point Park College.
Frank Melvin (Mel) Cratsley was born at Glenwillard, Pa., on 
November 9, 1917. He attended Findlay High School at Imperial, Ua., 
and graduated in 1935.
From 1936-39, Mel was a student at Carnegie Tech and played 
on what were probably the greatest teams Tech has ever had, 
both in basketball and football. In his senior year, the football 
team won the Lambert Trophy, emblematic of Eastern football 
supremacy and met Texas Christian in the Sugar Bowl at New 
Orleans. In basketball, Cratsley was instrumental in leading Tech 
to the championship of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference in 
1937 and to a tie for the first place in 1939.
In the 1937-38 season, against West Virginia, Cratsley scored 34 
points, 10 of which came in the last five minutes to help Carnegie 
defeat the Mountaineers and walk off with the Conference title. That 
34 point effort stood as the school record until Alan Frank broke it 
in the 1956-57 season.
Mel was graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1940 with a Bachelor 
of Science degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, he 
worked for two years as a foreman at Camegie-Illinois Steel Corpora
tion from 194042, and served in the United States Navy as a Lieu
tenant until 1946.
Upon his return from active duty, Cratsley returned to Carnegie-Dlinois as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Carrick 
Furnaces and remained there until 49.
While he was working at Camegie-Illinois, Mel became interested 
in the basketball fortunes of the Tartans and served as an assistant 
coach in the 1947-48 and 1948-49 seasons.
In 1949, Cratsley was named head basketball coach by Clarence 
Buddy Overend, who was then Athletic Director. In the same year, 
Mel earned a teaching certificate from Carnegie Tech and was ap
pointed Assistant Head of the Bureau of Placement in 1950.
He held this position in the Bureau of Placement until 1952 
when Overend retired as Athletic Director and Cratsley was 
named to replace him.
From that time on, Mel served in the dual capacity of both head 
basketball coach and Athletic Director.
Cratsley leaves Tech with a career record of 168-193 and this 
past season recorded the best basketball season in Carnegie Tech 
history with a 16-6 record. For this impressive season, he was award
ed the Pittsburgh Basketball Writers Coach of the Year award.
It is, of course, with mixed feelings that we part with Mr. Crats
ley. We must, of course, wish him the greatest success in his new 
appointment, but we must also be deeply sorrowful that we must 
part with a man who will long remain one of the great sports fig
ures in the history of Carnegie Tech.
