Drama Dept PlayStudents Vote To Elect
starts Tomorrow Best-Dressed College Girl
by Marcy Stern
uThe drama department production of As You Like It ; 
which will premiere tomorrow evening, began to take shape j
two weeks ago. ?---------------------- ]
ground !Then Lawrence Carra, faculty 
director, reported that the cast 
had a basic understanding of the 
scenes and characters and had the 
text of the play well in hand. All 
the scenes had been sketched in 
and rehearsals of two or three 
characters sequences through the 
play were in progress. These 
( scenes were done in order to as
sure successful emotional follow 
tthrough.
Last week these sequences were 
integrated and the cast began runthroughs of the entire play.
In additional preparation, the 
forresters learned their songs, the 
dance groups worked on their 
parts, and the crew was at work 
every evening and all weekend on 
construction of the sets and cos- C tumes.
The model set and costume il
lustrations created by the student 
designers are on display in the 
Hunt Library. This miniature set 
was used to aid the lighting direc
tor in achieving the atmosphere 
desired for various scenes.
Coordination and final polishing 
of all phases of the production 
acting, lighting, set and cos
tume design and construction  
( were done at the lengthy rehearals this past week.
Actually, preparation for As 
You Like It was begun long be
fore several weeks ago.
It began with the selection of 
the play last spring. Carra felt 
that the choice of this particular 
play was especially suited to the 
talents of the acting majors in the 
drama department. He felt that 
As You Like It, a happy play, 
would be a pleasant change from 
the past productions of Shake
spearean tragedies, Julius Cae
sar and Othello.
Months ago the student directors 
and designers were chosen and 
were given time to work out their 
ideas for the production. Appro
ximately six weeks ago, all of 
them met together with faculty 
advisors in a series of conferences
Tech Proposes 
Mudge Annex
by Gretchen Smith
Carnegie Tech is planning 
to build a dormitory wing ad
dition to Mudge Graduate 
House.
The annex, which is slated for 
completion by June 1966, will 
house 120 students and will be 
located between Morewood Gar
dens and the present graduate 
building. It will be attached to 
the Mudge mansion.
According to Richard Strathmeyer, (at Carnegie Tech) vice president for business affairs, the 
bontract for the annex will be 
awarded by May 1.
The present Mudge complex 
provides housing facilities for 160 
students. It consists of the man
sion, which contains kitchen fa
cilities, a dining area, lounges, 
and some dorm space, and the 
first annex, which contains more 
living facilities. The first annex 
was completed in I960.

system.
Tech isremodelingits steam distribution
Steam pipe lines are being in
staled beneath the Cut. These 
lines will connect the Doherty Hall 
steam lines with the steam system 
in the basement of Hunt Library. 
This steam system provides the 
library with heat and air con
ditioning.
Previously, the Hunt Library 
steam was fed through pipes from 
the basement of the Fine Arts 
building.
The steam condensed because 
the steam lines ran beneath elec
trical conduits on the side of the 
building. To alleviate this prob
lem, the additional pipes are being 
laid.
The new pipe lines will provide 
a more direct route from the orig
inal steam source in Hammerschlag Halt.
According to Lewis C. Mechling. Assistant Director for En

struction job is not of a major

Tech To Hold 
History Inst 
This Summer
The Carnegie Corporation 
of New York has given $90,000 
to Carnegie Tech to finance a 
summer institute in European 
history for teachers from 
southern colleges and univer
sities.
The seven-week institute, which 
will begin on June 14 and and 
continue to July 30, is designed 
to increase the participants 
knowledge, an to acquaint them 
with new teaching methods in 
history. This is the second such 
seminar conducted by Carnegie 
Tech under a grant from the Car
negie Corporation. Last year, 49 
teachers from predominately 
Negro colleges came to the Car
negie Tech campus for a similar 
program in American history.
Invitations to attend the insti
tute, which will have places for 
65 teachers, have been sent to 
predominately Negro colleges and 
universities, and to some other 
smaller southern colleges that 
have shown an interest in im
proving the quality of their pro
grams.
Professor David Fowler, direc
tor of the institute, and several 
other Carnegie Tech teachers plan 
to visit the southern campuses 
this spring to discuss the insti
tute with their history faculties.
The institute is one of ten, of
fering nine subjects, that are 
planned for the coming summer. 
They continue an effort to help 
Negro colleges begun by the 
American Council on Education 
and Educational Services Incorpo
rated.

Young men of ability can get to the top fast at 
Boeing. Today, Boeing's business backlog is 
just under two billion dollars, of which soma 
60 per cent is in commercial jetliner and heli
copter product areas. The remainder is in mili
tary programs and government space flight 
contracts. This gives the company one of the 
most stable and diversified business bases in 
the aerospace industry.
No matter where your career interests lie  
in the commercial jet airliners of the future 
or in space-flight technology  you can find 
an opening of genuine opportunity at Boeing. 
The company's world leadership in the jet 
transport field is an indication of the calibre 
of people youd work with at Boeing.
Boeing is now pioneering evolutionary ad
vances in the research, design, development 
and manufacture of civilian and military air
craft of the future, as well as space programs 
of such historic importance as Americas first 
moon landing. Gas turbine engines, transport 
helicopters, marine vehicles and basic re
search are other areas of Boeing activity.
Whether your career interests lie in basic or 
applied research, design, test, manufacturing

Editorial
PiDE Purposes . . .
Because PiDE is one campus organization which affects 
numerous student (over 200 - all students involved with 
publications), it is important that the student population be 
aware of the goals and scope of this honorary.
As a national honorary collegiate journalism fraternity, 
Pi Delta Epsilon is pledged to the promotion of student 
participation in undergraduate publications, and it seeks to 
establish a code of ethics among the staff of the individual 
college publications.
To fulfill these objectives, PiDE works as a governing 
body which advises the five Carnegie Tech publications (the 
Tartan, Patterns . . . , Technical, Thistle, and WRCT) on
financial, organizational, and personnel matters.
PiDE is composed of major editors of all publications and 
those who have been elected to membership because of their 
outstanding contributions to campus publications. There are 
two major committees which execute the major responsi
bilities of the honorary: these are the Financial Board and 
the Quality Control Board.
The Financial Board, which is composed of the Presi
dent and Treasurer of PiDE, the Chairman of the Financial 
Committee of Student Congress and Treasurer of Student 
Congress, the Co-ordinator of Student Activities, and the Di
rector of Public Relations, works with business managers of 
all publications to prepare budgets.
Needs of each publications are carefully examined and 
PiDE strives for the formulation of a budget which enables 
each publications to operate without a deficit at a level of 
quality commenserate with its importance.
Quality Control Board is composed of the major editor of 
each publication, the major faculty advisor of said publica
tion, and the vice-president of PiDE. The PiDE president, 
the Coordinator of Student Affairs, and the Director of Public 
Relations are ex-officio members of this board.
Quality Control Board acts in an advisory capacity; it 
approves all editors and staff editors for publications after 
carefully reviewing each candidates qualifications. The Board 
suggests any needed improvements in the quality of the 
publications, not only in the finished product but within 
the operations of the publications (personnel, training pro
grams, organizational structure, financial matters.)
PiDEs constitution also calls for a board which governs 
disciplinary control. This four member board, appointed by 
the president and approved by the membership, may be form
ed when the publications become involved in any disputes. 
Ths board has the authority to investigate all disciplinary 
problems which arise among publications and between publi
cations and other campus organizations.
It is only after PiDE has tried such a case and has de
cided that strong disciplinary action is required that such 
action is recommended to Executive Council or the Disciplin
ary Committee of Carnegie Tech.
Thus, PiDE  the general membership, the two stand
ing committees (financial, quality control), the Disciplinary 
Board  strives for continuous achievement and improve
ment in the campus publications.

Students Question Necessity 
Of Library Security Check
Editor, the Tartan:
We would like to express our 
appreciation for the longer li
brary hours, but at the same time 
to question the utility of having 
policemen inspect our books as 
we leave the library.
It seems clear that if a per
son steals a book after 9 oclock, 
it was available to be signed out 
before that time, and if he want
ed to steal a book, he could 
easily do it during regular library 
hours when there are no security 
measures.
While we recognize that it is 
necessary to have some sort of 
authority present in the library 
after 9 oclock, we suggest that 
the present policy be reviewed, 
as it seemingly serves no purpose 
and is an inconvenience to all 
concerned.

The Committee Heads of 
Student Congress met last 
Wednesday.
Marion Bowman discussed the 
question of succession of congress 
officers. A problem arose recently 
when the co-chairman of Congress 
resigned. In the event that an
other officer resigns, a general 
election in Congress is favored.
This matter will be brought be
fore Student Congress during the 
next meeting along with an out
line of t h e duties of the vicechairman.
Mike Gross, Head of the Gen
eral Campus Committee, said that 
he expects the administration to 
install pencil sharpeners in those 
places designated byDean Brown.
The addition of vending ma
chines in acadamic buildings was 
discussed by David Aronovitz. He 
said that machines would prob
ably be approved provided that 
they dont cause an increase in 
maintenance costs and do not 
create extra work for cleaning 
staff.
A suggestion was made that 
spring exam schedules and ad
vance course schedules should be 
made available to students. This 
would permit students to plan 
ahead for summers and arrange 
fall programs.

Pete Seeger
A Feature by Dwayne Thorpe
The man who becomes a legend in his own time before 
he has touched fifty is, maybe, not so rare as the enthusiastic 
admirers of these living monuments often lead us to 
believe.
g But there is a much rarer crea
ture, and one who is more worthy 
of attention simply because he 
appears so seldom. That man is 
the one who, simultaneously, is 
both a legend and nearly forgot
ten  a man whose image has 
dwarfed his own personality.
Such a man is Pete Seeger.
There is scarcely any one in 
America who doesnt know Seegers name; there is scarcely a 
f country on earth where he isnt 
' known (or where he hasnt been); 
and there is no folk musician who 
doesnt owe his living to the work 
Seeger did back in the days when 
folk music was a non-profit pro
position taken up only by those 
who were really dedicated to the 
music, not the fame. There is an 
Irish song, The Work of the 
Weavers, which unintentionally 
expresses that debt: If it was not 
 for the weavers what would you 
< do?
If it wasnt for the Weavers, 
who anticipated the American 
folk song revival, and for Pete 
Seeger, the best and most famous 
of them, wThat would folk singers 
do? Seeger, and a few men like 
him, made the present boom in 
folk music possible. There is no 
one who denies that, and there 
is no one who denies the great, ness of this mans accomplishments.
As if this werent enough for 
one man to do in a few years,
Seeger has been a tireless worker 
for social reform, and a successful 
one. It has been a long time that 
he has been singing for racial 
equality, justice for workers, an
Pete Seeger
grounp singing may be his cup of 
tea because a mediocre voice 
sounds better when it is drowned 
out by two thousand others.
His records demonstrate his 
failures more clearly than any
thing else ever could. What man 
alive can sing so convincingly and 
well in twenty different languages, 
languages which he doesnt even 
understand? Who is so versatile
that he can attack every form of 
end to war, international under-! folk music from blues to protest 
standing, and so on, in a nearly song to ballad to dance tune? Cerendless chain of causes that near- tainly not Seeger. All this shows 
ly everyone calls just, but which up excruciatingly on a record 
few people are willing to work or when the excitement of crowd re
even sing for. action isnt there to support him.
The present Civil Rights move- Now all his faults were apparment, for instance, is obviously ent when Seeger came to Pittsnot directly traceable to Seeger, burgh on Saturday, February 20. 
but over the years he has prob- At the Carnegie Music Hall he 
ably done as much as Martin gave the Fourth Annual Ceilidh
Concert, sponsored by the Car
negie Ceilidh and the Duquesne 
University Society for the Promodone as much 
Luther King to popularize and 
gain support for that movement, 
and it might be added that he was 
in on the gruond floor of that 
movement, more than twenty 
, years ago, when supporting the 
Negros cause wasnt considered 
fashionable or even admirable  
not even in the self-righteous 
North.
It is understandable why the 
legend of this man has grown all
tion of the Fine Arts, and the 
faults were there for anyone in
terested in looking for them.
But something else wyas there 
too, and that was the fact that a 
very great man was giving him
self to an audience and lending 
his power to it. The Carnegie 
Ceilidh, in its three previous con
of humor with message was so 
subtle that he was reminiscent of 
the man he himself made allusion 
to, Mark Twain. For this reason, 
his version of songs like Healing 
River or Bob Dylans Hard 
Rain were not maudlin or dis
gusting, but more often than not 
moving and powerful.
As a matter of fact, the most 
exciting moment of the evening 
was his singing of This Little 
Light of Mine, with which he 
closed the first half of the concert, 
and which was enough to get him 
a standing ovation at intermission.
Now, any man who gets a 
standing ovation at that point has 
something going ^or him. And 
that something was not only ap
parent but bulginglv apparent 
everywhere, even in his singing of 
childrens songs like Abiyoyo, a 
song which did not sound or look 
like the attempt of a man to es
cape into a childs world, but that 
world made real  as real as it is 
in Winnie the Pooh.
All this, it seemed, was made 
possible by the feeling that what
ever he sang, he was singing it 
for you. You were a part of the 
audience and aware of that, but 
somehow Seeger was able to make 
! you feel that you were the audi; ence.
But a list of songs and adjeci tives is hardly sufficient. Musical 
criticism, even when done much 
better than this, fails after all. 
There is always the charge that 
one is not reporting objectively, 
that one is being emotional. But 
who ever said reactions to art 
should or can be objective?
Maybe only film could capture 
it after all. Maybe only film can 
show Seeger dipping down, coiled 
like a spring charged with elec
tricity, both his feet sliding and 
going at once, pounding the stage 
floor, the boogie rhythm of his 
twelve-string perfectly matching 
the boogie rhythm of his grin.
Maybe only film can show a 
whole audience leaning forward,
| stomping their feet, singing at the 
| top of their lungs. Only film can 
i show Pete bending back, more 
I than six feet of him, showing 
j nothing for a face but a bobbing 
Adams apple. And only film can 
tell the love (a noun chosen care
fully) that is in an audience 
which laughs out of love when 
Seeger pops a button off the cuff 
of his shirt in his haste to get that 
sleeve rolled up so that he can 
sing a song, or the disappointment 
in a womans voice when she says, 
You mean I cant even share a 
cigarette with Pete?
Only film can show three small,

equally desperate fans crying for

be the year for Tech to embarrass 
our big-time neighbors.
Carnegie Techs Tartans dropped their thirteenth game 
in seventeen starts this year, losing to St. Vincent, 80-60, but 
thanks to the weather man, Techs record wont be as bad as 
it could have been. A heavy snow-4 
fall last Thursday mercifully I with 
caused the cancellation of the 
John Carroll game, thereby avert
ing another probable loss. How
ever, the cancellation also squashed 
any hopes of Jeff Kalin breaking 
Mike Flynns 1960-61 record for 
most field goals in one season.
With four games to be played,
Kalin had 123 field goals, and 
needed an average of nine per 
game to break Flynns record of 
158. Jeff managed to add seven 
more against St. Vincent, for 130, 
but it would take a superhuman 
effort against Pitt and Fenn for 
him to snare the record.

margin. Coming out of the locker 
room with a 38-34 lead, the Tar
tans defense quickly collapsed, 
and the Bearcats took a 44-40 ad
vantage, never again to be head
ed.
With St. Vincent playing a run
ning game against the tired Tech 
defense, the score quickly widen
ed in favor of the Bearcats, who 
walked off with" an 80-60 victory. 
High scorer for Tech was Kalin, 
who garnered 22. Hank Werronen 
chipped in with 10, and Jim 
Newell with 9.
Action this week will pit Tech 
against Pitt, tonight, and Fenn, 
on Saturday, to finish out the sea
son. Both games will be at Skibo 
Gym, starting time at 8:15. The 
Tartans could add some glamor to 
a totally lacklcrster year by whip
ping (or even squeaking past) the 
Panthers from Oakland. The Cats 
are also having a miserable year

Rifle Team Beats 2 Schools;
Gets Biggest Win of Season
Paced by junior sharpshooter Mike Knepley, team cap
tain Bob Fritz, and freshman Ted Mankovich, the Carnegie 
Tech rifle team rolled up its biggest score in three years, 
defeating Allegheny and Washington and Jefferson in a dual 
match for its biggest win of the previously so-so season.
The Tartans fired an excellent 
1414, five points better than the 
1409 fired against Duquesne last 
month. This was enough to crush 
W&J who shot a 1387 and to edge 
Allegheny who also shot 1414, but

scored 32 points, Jim Kamm add
ed 19, and Dale Johnson con
tributed 18. GSIA B defeated

Other league action found the 
Archers defeating ATO B 26 
to 11.
GSIA opened the defense of 
their school championship with

Howie Pifer, paced the grads in 
this one with 24 points, while 
Hal Klingsporn added 18. TDP
