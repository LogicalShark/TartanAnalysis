Brown Approves SG 
to Control Student
On Dec. 12, 1967, the Student 
Senate of Camegie-Mellon Uni
versity sent a letter to Dean 
Brown in which seven proposals 
were outlined which would give 
Student Government control 
over all finances concerning 
student activities. Six of these 
seven proposals were found im
mediately acceptable, and in
clude those listed below.
Proposal I: An account is to 
be set up with C-MU in the 
name Of Student Government to 
hold funds budgeted for the fol
lowing categories: Student Ac
tivities, Fall Festival and Spring 
Carnival, assembly speakers, 
and a Student Government Re
serve Fund. Transferring the 
Assembly budget to Student 
Government, according to Dean 
Brown would require considera
tion by the Executive Board. 
However, he thought that there 
is a good chance of the trans
ference taking place. Also, 
Homecoming and Spring Car
nival expenses will continue to 
be underwritten by the Admin
istration.
II: All organizations receiving 
major ($1,000 or more) appro
priations from the Student Ac
tivities Budget will be granted 
that appropriation for the year, 
but will have their financial 
status reviewed at the end of 
each semester by Student Sen
ate, at which time changes in 
the appropriation may be made.
Ill: Major changes ($500 or 
more) from the Senate Activi
ties budget of an organization 
it its expenditures must be ap
proved by Student Senate.
IV: A Special committee of 
Student Senate and faculty 
members shall be set up for the 
purpose of obtaining speakers 
for the established assembly 
periods.
V: Student Government Re
serve Fund shall be a reserve 
account for all student activi
ties.
A. Student Senate shall have 
the authority to appropriate 
funds from this account for 
purposes not included in the 
Student Activities budget.
B. This fund shall be under 
the responsibility of the finance 
committee of Student Senate.
C. Funds from this account 
can be drawn only with the 
signatures of the treasurer of 
Student Government and the 
Coordinator of Student Activities.
VI: The total allocation of the 
account shall be determined at 
the start of the academic year. 
Student senate shall have the 
authority to reallocate the 
funds this account.
Proposal VII provides that all 
Student activities are to be fin
ancially responsible to student 
government, so that conduction 
l all financial matters between 
a student activity and C-MU 
would take place through the 
student Senate ... In reply to 
this proposal, Dr. Brown stated 
that the university completely 
agrees with the proposal as 
stated; Vol luml e6 an activity
Proposals
feels that it has been unjustly 
treated by Senate, that organ
ization could appeal to the Ad
ministration through the Divi
sion of Student Affairs. He 
pointed out, however, that such 
an appeal could not proceed
 . . until it was ascertained 
that negotiation with student 
government had been completed, 
and that Student Government 
was aware of the appeal so that 
it could be represented also.
The Constitution of Student 
Government states that Student 
Senate is . . . . to be responsi
ble for thet finances of Student 
Activities and to promote the 
welfare of the Student Body. 
The long-range effects of these 
measures are to develop all Stu
dent Activities under the super
vision of Student Government 
which means ultimately that in 
order to survive, an activity 
will have to contribute optimal
ly to the welfare of the Student 
Body as a whole. These meas
ures were not designed to limit 
individual student activities. On 
the contrary, by making these 
activities directly responsible to 
the Student Body, it is hoped 
that more students will take an 
interest in the activities which 
are receiving money from their 
budget
Changes Proposed 
for Election Rules
Don Baer, Senate representa
tive from the Mens Dorms and 
Chairman of the Rules Commit
tee, has announced that the next 
session of the Rules Committee 
on February 19 will begin de
bate on various proposed 
changes in the election rules. 
These changes will seek to pre
vent a repition of last years 
challenged election as well as 
promote a greater voter turnout. 
Some of the proposals include
1) reducing the number of sig
nature on a petition for repre
sentative to 25; 2) allotting one 
ballot for each person with one 
ID card; and 3) having separate 
balloting places in each constit
uency and separate ballots for 
representatives and President 
and Vice President.
The first change woidd bring 
out more candidates and give 
the voters a wider choice for 
t h e i r Senate Representatives. 
The second would make multi
ple voting illegal and the final 
proposal would make voting 
easier and the elections more 
local.
Also on the agenda when the 
Committee convenes is a pro
posal to require all legislation 
to be submitted at least one 
meeting before it is to be voted

Donald Edwards Presents McCarthy 
Campaign As Opportunity for Choice
Congressman Don Edwards of 
California spoke before a rally 
last Friday night, February 9, 
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall in 
support of Eugene McCarthy 
for President. The rally repre
sented the beginning of a cam
paign by the Citizens for McCar
thy in Western Pennsyvania, a 
group which seeks to promote 
the Senator from Minnesota as 
the Democratic candidate for 
President in 1968. Congressman 
Edwards has been one of the 
first major Democratic leaders 
to come out in active support for 
MaCarthy and has been speak
ing extensively on behalf of Mc
Carthy throughout the country.
Friday afternoon Congress
man Edwards held a press con
ference at the Pittsburgh Press 
Club and expended on some of 
the themes he presented in his 
speech later in the day. Edwards 
stressed that he considered him
self a good Democrat work

a candidate who opposes policies 
of the present administration 
which Edward feels are intoler
able. As presented by Ed

On February 9th, 10th land 
11th, Gordon Cohen, Perry Chon 
and Jacqueline Pratt attended a 
Civitas conference Beyond the 
Ivory TowerSocial Responsi
bility and the College Student 
held at Cornell University in 
Ithica, New York.
Civitas or Cornell-Ithica Vol
unteers In Training And Service 
is Cornells social service organzation. It was the belief of Civ
itas that while many campuses 
maintain social service commit
tees, these committees could all 
benefit from evaluation and co
operation. This conference dealt 
specifically with the problems 
of tutorials and counseling be
cause not only are these the 
most commonly widely found 
forms of social service, but also 
because it is found that tutor
ing and counseling provide the 
most practical concrete benefits 
to both volunteer and benefac
tor given the limits of the time 
and talent of the average col
lege student.
Sixty-five colleges and uni
versities were represented from 
the United States and Canadas 
Eastern region including the 
University of Illinois, University 
of Wisconsin, University of

Pittsburgh Free U. 
Offers 26 Courses
The Pittsburgh Free Univer
sity will begin classes for its 
spring term on Feb. 12. In all 
there will be 26 different cours
es, with the topics ranging from 
Ganfalloon, a science fiction, 
Hobbit oriented group; through 
Obscenity, a psychiatric, religi
ous and governmental examin
ation of the obscenity concept 
in the United States. Anyone 
can attend one of the courses, 
or more than one. There are no 
tests or grades and registration 
is not required. A catalog list
ing courses, times and places is 
available upon request.
The Pittsburgh Free Univer
sity is a voluntary organization 
founded last year. Its aim is to 
enable anyone to participate in 
group situdies on subjects that 
are of interest, or are matters 
of concern. The courses do not 
have a teacher-student format, 
instead they are organized in 
the manner of a study group. 
Every participant is a teacher 
and a student at the same time.
Anyone may attend any of the 
courses, or if he wishes may 
even start his own course. This 
can be done by contacting a 
member of the Curriculum Com
mittee of the Pittsburgh Free 
University.
There will be a Free Univer
sity Forum at 8 pm Thursday, 
Feb. 15, at the United Oakland 
Ministry, Fifth Ave. and Bellefleld St. in Oakland. The speak
er will be Robert Theobald.
For more information and/or

Student Contempt 
for Big Business
Editor, The TARTAN:
Businessmen who recruit col
lege graduates are shocked 
these days to discover that busi
ness careers are looked down on 
as undesirable by a majority oi 
college students. The "Cash 
Register Building is a contem
ptuous term for the business 
school. Yet, isnt it reasonable to 
assume that, if business has 
brought this country unparallel
ed prosperity and world leader
ship, our most capable young 
men should flock to join up with 
business? Such is not the case.
Todays college student is a 
very discerning fellow. In simple 
terms, he is "hep. Like his 
father before him, he wants se
curity. But he wants security 
plus. He also wants life that has 
meaning to him as an individ
ual. He isnt about to trade his 
life for security, only security.
Big business, he is aware, de
mands much for this security. 
He must give his all to the com
pany. He must stand ready to 
endure innumerable transfers, 
all of them expensive in re
adjustments of his home life 
and his childrens friendships. 
And he may be asked to spend 
many years in the ranks, mark
ing time, waiting for the chance 
to move up. This story has been 
told many times. What has not 
been told is that many fields 
professions, government, teach
ingnow offer real security 
without such penalties..
The penalties of a business ca
reer might be a fair exchange 
for security, real security. But 
the security that is offered is it
self flawed. For, even in big 
business, there is no security. A 
mans path to success may be 
blocked by a boss who dislikes 
hima "personality conflict, 
so-called. His choice of friends, 
even his wife, may disqualify 
him. As in the end someone al
ways pays for such oversights. 
And right now it is business 
which is paying. For the word 
has got back to the campus. And 
when businessmen try to tell 
their story on the campus, no 
one is listening. No one is listen

Sincerely yours,

Student Denounces 
Quality of Opera
Editor, the TARTAN
Last evening (Jan. 18) while 
attending the Pittsburgh Opera 
Incorporated presentation of 
Verdis Aida, I was astounded 
by the low quality, amateurish 
performance. For a city that 
claims itself "culturally rich, 
this performance not only lack
ed culture but also badly need
ed those stagecrafts that any 
high school production has. The 
stage was continually lit in a 
steel blue tone which was not 
only inappropriate for most 
scenes, but was so poorly pro
jected that shadows were cast 
across the entire stage and on
to the cyclorama curtain.
As Act 1 began the lights at
tempted to come up, but due to 
someones fumbling didnt quite 
make it. The lights were then 
pumped up and down to that 
point which someone thought 
appropriate. I wish I could have 
agreed! The scenery was barely 
adequate and the same pyramid 
was used as the backing piece 
for all scenes with the exception 
of the scene in Princess Amneriss chambers.

Miss Gladys Schmitt and Dr. William Mullins discuss 
The University and Society.
"A Conversation with Gladys 
Schmitt, a third in a series of 
Camegie-Mellon lectures on the 
theme of "The University and 
Society, was an interview which 
was unique in its personalities 
and mood of casualness. The 
audience at Skibo Ballroom 
Thursday, Feb. 8, was taken into 
the world of the artist as Miss 
Schmitt (Mrs. Simon Goldfield), 
English professor at C-MU and 
writer, who may be placed in 
the sphere of the very few ar
tists who write both prose and 
poetry, was interviewed by Dr. 
William W. Mullins, the dean 
of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, who Dean Stein
berg introduced so appropriate
ly as "scientist and humanist. 
Although the conversation stuck 
rigidly to a list of pre-arranged 
questions, the interplay between 
Miss Schmitt and Dr. Mullins 
fell with a warm spontaneity to 
the listener.
The purpose of this "dialogue 
between two worlds, as Dr. 
Mullins explained, was to give 
a picture of the creative world 
and of the life of the artist. 
Miss Schimtt, the author of 
Rembrandt, the study of the 
creative artist, first expressed 
her own early dilemna of choos
ing between fields of interest: 
the fascination history had al
ways held for her, her prepara
tion for a painting career. Sig
nificantly, these two interests 
are well-incorporated in Miss 
Schmitts literary work. Rem
brandt, Electra, David the King, 
to name a few, all deal with his
torical figures and events. When 
Dr. Mullins later quoted the 
first paragraph from Electra, it 
appeared before the audience 
with a visual impact close to 
that visual quality of a paint
end1
The talk between Miss Schmitt 
and Dr. Mullins worked towards 
a description of literary crea
tivity. Both a sense of sound 
and rhythm are integral to the 
artist. Gladys Schmitts concep
tion of herself as a poet crystalized when she became aware 
of her ability to rhyme; and, to 
write a book, she must first 
"hear it. Systematically, she 
reads only between writing or 
limits her reading to some other 
literary form than than on which 
she is concurrently working; be
cause, to her, any tone picked 
up by the ear "has resonances 
of previous literature.
The involvement of the ar
tist within his work is tremen
dous. Discussing the creation of 
character, Gladys Schmitt be
lieves that the witers body as
sumes the actions of the char
acter being created and added 
during the question-and-answer 
period following the interview 
that the artist has an obliga
tion to be deeply empathic for 
both sexes. He must be father, 
mother, child, lover, etc. Art, as 
she sees it, is a different life and, 
at the same time, is a substitute 
for life. From her own involve
ment comes a restlessness when 
she is not writing.
However, as the interview 
brought out, part of the descrip
tion of the process of literary 
creativity is an indefinableness 
and a sporadic aspect. The con
crete procedure of creating 
means to Gladys Schimtt threehour stretches of work with an 
end result, hopefully of "three 
pages per day for five days. 
Agreeing with Dr. Mullins con
cept that there is an altera
tion between routine and creaVolumeu67 lu Nbr7 8)
tion possessed was the fine sing
ing performances given by Gia
nni Savelli, Nell Rankin, and 
Daniica Mastilovic. Since one 
could never see the facial ex
pressions or movements of the 
faces, an equally fine audible per
formance could have been ob
tained (and at a more reason
able cost. . . $8.50 per orchestra 
seat to $3.50 for the second bal
cony) from one of the many 
fine recordings of Aida.
Aside from the poor acoustical 
quality of the Syria Mosque it
self, and the poorer job done 
with the lights as culminated by 
the blinking light in the fourth 
act, the audience was rude. Dr. 
Karp, the conductor was forced 
as the second scene of the sec
ond act began to quiet the aud
ience. He started the music and 
realizing that audience wasnt 
attentive he turned and yelled 
"Quiet, some people are trying 
to listen repremanding the aud
ience. As he was about to begin 
anew, he turned back towards 
the audience, and said Pardon 
the interruption of your conver
sation, at which point he re
ceived a small round of applause 
from those who were trying to 
enjoy what they could of the 
opera..
So far, the choreography of 
the opera hasnt been mentioned. 
The reason for this is one fold. 
There was no choreography! 
There were occasional instances 
that resembled a directed coor
dinated effort, but these were 
30 few and lasted for such a 
short period of time that they 
are hardly worth mentioning. 
Even the principal characters 
did not know what to do with 
themselves as they didnt appear 
to have any blocking pre-arrang
ed for them. The singers were 
forced to seek out the spotlights 
and position themselves under 
them in the hope that they 
might be seen by the audience.
My date, having seen the op
era in Rome and I at the Met 
in New York feel that this per
formance of Aida was not only 
an insult to Verdi, but also an 
underestimation of the level of 
cultural enjoyment of the people 
of the city of Pittsburgh. Aida 
has been performed on num
erous occasions by the Pitts
burgh Opera Incorporated and 
one would think that by now, 
some degree of sophistication 
would have been obtained. 
Sincerely yours,
Ronald Lloyd Herold

Wednesday, February 14, 1968  THE TARTAN  Page 3Draft Card Burning - - A Government Interference
Campus Y Launches Membership Drive, 
Offers Variety of Opportunities
WASHINGTON (CPS)Does 
a young man who burns his 
draft card engage in an act of 
symbolic speech which in no 
way interferes with the legiti
mate processes of government?
Or should his action be label
ed as conduct, rather than 
speech, and does this conduct 
hinder the effective operation 
of the Selective Service system?
The U. S. Supreme Court ar
guments both ways this week 
in a highly controversial case 
testing the constitutional valid
ity of a 1965 law making it un
lawful for any person to know
ingly destroy or mullilate his 
draft card. This is the first test 
of the law before the Supreme 
Court.
The case was initiated by 
David P. OBrien, 21 who was 
convicted under the law in the 
Boston Federal Court in 1966. 
However, the Court of Appeals 
fo* the First District struck 
down the law as unconstitu
tional, but found that OBrien 
was guilty of not possessing 
his draft card, and he was sent
enced to prison anyway.
The case reached the Su
preme Court on appeal from 
both the Justice Department 
and OBrien attorneys. The Jus
tice Department appealed the 
decision that the law is uncon
stitutional and in a separate 
case, OBrien appealed that it 
was unconstitutional for him to 
be sentenced for non-possession 
of his draft card, when he was 
indicted and tried for burning 
the card.
Marvin M. Karpatkin, an 
American Civil Liberties Union 
lawyer who argued OBriens 
case from before the Supreme 
Court, said OBrien burned his 
draft card as an act of sym
bolic speech, and the 1965 law, 
therefore, is an abridgement of 
the freedom of speech guaran
tees of the First Amendment.
Karpatkin said previous Su
preme Court decisions have as
serted that free speech includes 
not only verbal expression, but 
also appropriate types of ac
tion. Among the acts of sym
bolic expression protested by the 
high court are the right of pro
testors to display red flags as 
a symbol of opposition to the 
government, and the right to 
picket and demonstrate peace
fully.
U. S- Solicitor General Erwin 
N. Griswold conceded that some 
acts may be considered symbolic 
speech, but he argued that burn
ing a draft card does not fall in
to this category. I suppose that 
assaulting an official of the Se
lective Service system could be 
thought of as symbolic speech, 
or that refusing to report for 
induction could be considered 
symbolic speech, Griswold said.
Karpatkin told the Court that 
Congress passed the draft-card 
burning law for the purpose of 
supressing dissent, and said 
the law has no legislative pur
pose. The destruction of a Se
lective Service certificate by its 
bearer in no way affects the 
economic or military capabil
ities of the U. S., he said in 
his brief to the Court.
However, Griswold said Con
gress passed the law under its 
institutional authority to raise
and support armies. The legis
lation is constitutionally vaild, 
he said, because it facilities the 
effective operation of the Selec
tive Service System.
The Supreme Court Justices 
who questioned both Karpatkin 
and Griswold inficated they 
think the important point is 
whether or not a draft card has 
an important government func
tion, other than to notify a reg
istrant of his draft status.
Their questions indicated that 
if a draft card does have an 
important function, then it 
would be unconstitutional to des
troy it. Justice Abe Fortas ask
ed, If somebody decides to pro
tect high taxes by burning their 
tax records, would this be sym
bolic speech? Chief Justice Earl 
Warren indicated he thinks 
draft cards have a legitimate 
purpose because of the way 
millions of young people are 
floating around from place to 
place.
But Karpatkin said the Se
lective Service System has ex
tensive records, and a draft card 
only helps to identify a young 
person as 18 years of age in a 
state where you have to be 18 
tio buy alcoholic beverages.
In the second major point con
cerning OBrien, Karpatkin ar
gued that the Court of Appeals 
was wrong in finding that 
OBrien could be sentenced for 
not possessing his draft card 
because he was not charged 
with this offense, the prosecu
tion never mentioned it, the 
jury was not instructed to con
sider it, and the petitioner 
(OBrien) had no reason to sup
pose that he was on trial for 
it.
Griswold, on the other hand, 
said if OBrien burned his draft 
card, it is an inevitable conse
quence that he was thereafter 
not in possession of it.
Justice Fortas seemed to rep
resent the sentiments of the 
Court when he said, You mean 
there is no unfairness by charg
ing one thing and then justify
ing the sentioe by referring to 
a totally different act?
The Supreme Courts decision 
on the constitutional issues 
probably will be handed down in 
about a month.
Although the high court has 
never before issued a ruling on 
the 165 law, two U. S. Courts 
of Appeals have issued conflict
ing decisions on it. In the 
OBrien case, the U. S. Court of 
Appeals for the First Circuit 
said the law singles out per
sons engaging in protests for 
special treatment, and that such 
legislation strikes at the very 
core of what the First Amend
ment protects. However, in a 
case involving David Miller, who 
burned his draft card at a New 
York City street rally, the Court 
of Appeals fo rthe Second Cir
cuit affirmed Millers conviction 
and denied the draft card burn
ing is symbolic speech protected 
by the First Amendment. The 
Supreme Court refused to re
view the Millercase.
OBrien, who is now a student 
at Boston University, said he 
would not attempt to predict 
how the Supreme Court will 
decide the case, But I know 
what they should do, he said.
Draft Situation 
Still Unclear
WASHINGTON (OPS)Last 
fall, education officials were 
saying that chaos would result 
if President: Johnson didnt act 
to clear up the uncertainties in 
the draft situation by the first 
of the year.
The first has come and gone, 
the White House is still silent 
on the draft, and graduate 
schools and potential grad stu
dents are seeing the first signs 
of the chaos that was predic
ted.
There are two major ques
tions that still must be decided 
regarding the draft: The first 
is, how are the actual draftees' 
to be selected from the pool 
of draft-eligible men; the second 
is, what academic fields, if any, 
are to be designated as provid
ing draft deferments for those 
doing graduate work in them.
(Under the terms of the 1967 
draft law, the National Security 
Council actually has the power 
to decide the second question. 
The Council includes high offi
cials such as the Vice President 
and the Secretary of State, as 
well as the President. In fact, 
though, the President will un
doubtedly make the final de
cision on both questions con
cerning the draft, if any de
cisions are made.)
Graduate school deans have 
been predicting that their in
coming classes next fall would 
be made up primarily of vet
erans and women, since they 
assumed most graduating male 
seniors would be drafted. This 
prediction may turn out to be 
true, but at this point theres 
no way of knowing, because the 
President hasnt yet said who 
hes going to draft..
Therefore, graduate schools 
which are beginning to make 
decisions on applicants cant tell 
whether or not the students 
they accept this spring will be 
coming in the fall.
A similar problem exists for 
students. College seniors and 
first-year grad students cant 
plan for future study until the 
governments draft policies are 
cleared up.
At this point any speculation 
about what the White House 
will (to must be very tentative, 
because there really is no way 
of knowing. Education officials 
with close contacts in govern
ment predicted action by the 
President before Christmas, and 
nothing came of it. There are, 
however, a few observations 
that can be made.
It appears that the President 
(or, in this case, the President 
and other members of the Na
tional Security Council) will not 
grant deferments to all grad 
students in the natural scien
ces, math and engineering.
A special government commit
tee set up to study the defer
ments question last year rec
ommended deferments of this 
kind. Although the White House 
has not said anything publicly 
about a decision, education of
ficials have been told privately 
that the President has rejected 
the committees recommenda
tions.
Whether he and the Council 
will designate certain narrowly 
defined fields as draft-deferrable 
is at this point unknown.
On the question of how draf
tees will be chosen, there is 
only one thing that can be said 
with a relative degree of certain
ty at this pointthe White 
House will do something. If it 
doesnt and if Congress also fails 
to act, then the traditional Selec
tive Service method of drafting 
the oldest eligible males first 
will be followed, meaning that
C-MUs Young Mens Christian 
Association will launch its an
nual membership drive next 
week. Before the drve gets un
der way, the YMCA is seeking 
to advertise two points  what 
the Y is, and what the Y does.
What the Y is cannot easily 
be defined, even by T. A. Huff, 
Secretary of the Association 
nor by Ron Livak, student Pres
ident. The Y is not a religious 
organization, the y say. What 
confuses everybody is the 
Christian in the Ys title, and 
the fact that the YMCA staff 
here at C-MU also serves as co
ordinating body for the campus 
Bureau of Religious Affairs. 
Still, the Y welcomes members 
of any faih, or no faith, as long 
as they share in the common 
objectives of the Y: to study 
and work for a rich and full life 
in a free and just society, to 
seek lifes purpose, and to at 
least consider the power and 
relevance of the Christian faith.
The YMCA involves itself in 
many worthwhile and challeng
ing projects on campus. When 
a student buys a membership 
to the Y, he is supporting, finan
cially, an oryanization that op
erates its many projects on lit
tle more than membership 
funds and the salaries of the
Y administrators, who, incident
ally, are paid by the Pittsburyh 
YMCA, not by C-MU Member
ship, aside from financial sup
port, makes one eligible to serve 
on exerutive committees for Y 
projects.
Briefly, some of the YMCAs 
recent and current projects are: 
Scuba Lessons: The Y offers 
a course in scuba diviny. A fee 
is attached in order to pay the 
scuba instructor. The particithe Army will be full of college 
graduates..
To make sure that there is 
some diversity in the ages of 
the draftees, the President will 
have to take action. What he 
will do, and when, however, is 
not clear at this point.
John Morse, an official of the 
American Council on Education 
(ACE), believes the President 
will set up seven age groups, 
one for each year from 19 to 
25, and then order draft boards 
to choose a certain percentage 
of each group for service. Pre
sumably about a third of drafteligible college men would be 
taken under such a system, 
since draft needs for the coming 
yyear are anticipated at about 
a third of the total draft-eligible 
pool.
Whether Morses prediction is 
borne out or not, it is safe to 
say that not all draft-eligible 
college graduates will be draft
ed. Unfortunately there is no 
way of predicting which of them 
will be taken.. Priority may be 
given to those with birthdays 
early in the year, as some have 
suggested, but then again it may 
not.
Morse and other educataion 
officials in Washington are now 
concentrating thehir efforts on 
getting Congress to clear up 
the draft situation. Although 
there is not much an individual 
student can do to get action 
from the White House, students 
can assist in pushing for Cong
ressional action by writing to 
Senators and Representatives..
pant provides his own equip
ment.
Sensitivity Training: Recently 
the Y conducted two experi
ments in self-study, one during 
Thanksgiving, the other over In 
tercession. The participants went 
off to camp for several days, 
there studying with the aid of 
two psychologists, problems in 
personal psychology.
South-East Aisa Symposium: 
This program was organized by 
an Indonesian grad student and 
will consist of three events a 
the end of February. A speakei 
on the 27th at 11:30 am will 
discuss the topic; Internation
al Relationships in South-East 
Asia. At 7:30 pm on the 27th 
the symposium will deal with 
basic economic factors in S. E. 
Asia. On the 28th, again at 7:30 
pm, the discussion will center 
about the effects of Western 
participation in S. E. Asian econ
omy. The aim of the symposium 
is to look beyond Vietnam 
toward future American infolvement in countries such as In
donesia, Thailand, Malasia, and 
the Philippines.
The Philippines Project:
C-MUs first overseas project for 
students! (See feature on pro
ject)
Colloquium On The City: This 
project will take place on March 
4th, at 7:30. In connection with 
the colloquium, there will be an 
exhibit, during the week prior 
to the 4th. of work done by 
C-MU students in the Oakland 
Project, plus a collection from 
Halfway House, the Hil Dis 
tricts Art gallery.
International Firesides: The
Y sponsors this informal get 
together session for foreign ant 
American students so that the> 
can talk over their ideas and 
problems under the auspices of 
a professor or faculty member. 
The first of these meetings will 
take place in the home of Dr. 
Stever, on Feb. 18 at 7:30 pm.
Freshman Cabinet: The cab
inet gives freshmen, otherwise, 
unrepresented, a voice in cam
pus affairs. Memebrs are select
ed on the basis of High School 
records. The group discusses 
problems, especially those of 
Freshmen.
Campus Luncheon Forum:
This year the Forum is open 
to the entire campus. There is 
a speaker and then a questionand-answer session. The objec
tive of the Forum is to facil
itate communication on campus.
Friday Film Series: The Y
series should not be confused 
with the Underground Films. 
Though at first the Y feared 
that the series might fail be
cause it is slightly repititious, 
they are pleased with the at
tendance they have drawn.
And the Y will even send you 
a Birthday Cake on your day, 
which is a c onvenience for your 
parents, and a source of rev
enue for the YMCA.
One more unofficial attribute 
of the Y is that Tom Huff and 
Heather Smith (YWCA) are 
available to students interested 
in starting a project. Theyll 
talk and give their ideas free
ly, to anyone needful of talk 
and ideas and encouragement
But the YMCA needs student 
support. Frankly, it needs money 
in order to keep up all its pro
jects.

Peace Corps Offers 
Idealistic Goals
At the start of his career, 
the student is optimistic, ideal
istic, and often bubbling over 
with enthusiasm. During his 
years at college, he becomes 
aware that he cant change the 
world and that the machine 
has been in motion too long for 
one year to do anything except 
unmask itself. So he becomes 
a cynic and a super realist with 
a defeaatist attitude uncommon 
to young people of previous 
times. Everything is futile. What 
can a person do? What will give 
his life meaning?
One answer is the Peace 
Corps. The foundation of the 
Peace Corps is idealism. The 
idealistic goals of the Peace 
Corps are not the improvement 
of living; standards, but also the 
promotion of better communica
tion and understanding. Com
munication and understanding 
are the basis for a new approach 
to foreign affairs. They foresee 
peace being achieved not with 
napalm and grenades but with 
love and understanding.
The volunteer finds that he 
also benefits greatly from the 
experience. He is more tolerant 
to another way of life no matter 
how primitive it may seem.
The volunteers represent 
many facets of the American 
society, ranging from highly 
trained psychiatrists to college 
students teaching sanitation and 
nuitrition to the women of the 
land. Fifty per cent of the vol
unteers do some sort of teaching 
either in primary, secondary or 
university level.
Sometimes the volunteers are 
struck by the incomprehensible 
futility of their task. The ruts 
they encounter make progress 
a slow process. But the Peace 
Corps as a whole has made 
great strides in the improve
ment of health, education and 
welfare in underprivileged coun
tries. But in keeping in mind 
that the idealistic goals of the 
Peace Corps are a reality and 
that the idealism in general has 
accomplished great things, the 
futility can be overlooked.

At the present time the aver
age age of the volunteer is 25 
for women and 24 for men. The 
Peace Corps is interested in recruting older people who have 
skill because it feels that they 
could do much more in the 
Peace Corps than they are do
ing here, being replaced by 
younger people or machines.
Volunteers are preferred to 
have some sort of specialized 
skill or a college degree. All 
must be over 18 and have an 
ability to learn languages since 
they must learn the language 
of the country in which they 
m, working. The Peace Corps 
test which is given to all pros
pective volunteers is a language 
m4leloy, l,al
Once accepted into the Peace 
Corps (60 per cent of all the ap
plicants become volunteers), the 
volunteers have a choice of 
where they want to work and 
are trained for a month. They 
spend two years in the country 
and then may apply for another 
year. The maximum stay is five 
years. Volunteers receive $75 a 
month but do not receive the 
money until the end of the twd 
years when $1500 is given to 
them to tie them over until they 
find a job. A 15-day time span 
is allowed for vacations.
The answer for many is the 
Peace Corps. The hardship it 
presents is well balanced by 
the self-satisfying end.
Peace Corps, U. Cal. 
Initiate Program
A special program combining 
graduate agricultural studies 
with Peace Corps service will be 
started next fall on the Univer
sity of California campus at 
Davis, the agency announced to
day.
Beginning next September, 
nine months of graduate study 
will be offered, including one 
month of intensive language 
training and followed by two 
years of service as a Peace 
Corps Volunteer.
The first group will be aasigned to India where the Peace 
Corps has its largest agricul
ture program.
There are about 1,000 Volun
teers in India. Most of them are 
liberal arts graduates given 
special intensive agriculture 
training in a specific skill such 
a crop production or poultry 
raising..
Those who go through the 
Cal-Davis program will be as
signed to agricultural colleges 
in India to work with their re
search and extension staffs. 
They will carry on adaptive re
search and demonstraations of 
appropriate agricultural practi
ces as well as assist farmers by
introducing progressive agricul
ture methods..
Applicants must meet the 
standards of both the Peace 
Corps and the graduate division 
of the University of California 
College of Agriculture and En
vironmental Science at Davis.
In addition to students with 
degrees in agriculture or a sci
ence, liberal arts graduates with 
strong backgrounds in science 
or agricultural are also eligible, 
the Peace Corps said.
Applicants accepted for the 
program will ge special instruc
tion in the agriculture, language,

Significant Literary Figures of 20th Cent. 
Theme of 20th Annual Lecture Series
by JENIFER DIGBY
"I realize that many demands 
are made on the Tartan ior 
stories. It seems to me however, 
that a lecture series that has 
had a 20-year uninterrupted ex
istence on this campus is worthy 
of note. So wrote Dr. A. F. 
Sochatoff ill a memo to Tartan 
Editor Len Wanetik. The lec
ture series he referred to is in
deed worthy of note. It involves, 
this year, three lectures by 
members of the English Depart
ment faculty. The series will 
run on consecutive Tuesdays at 
11:30 pm, and will center loose
ly about the theme: "Signifi
cantly Literary Figures of the 
20th Century. The lectures will 
be given in the Carnegie Thea
tre in the Fine Arts Building, 
starting on Feburary 20th.
Beckman W. Cottrell will lec
ture first on a leading dramatist 
of this century: Eugene ONeill. 
Cottrell himself is specialized 
somewhat in the field having 
taught graduate courses on mod
em drama.
On February 27, Joseph Baim 
will present a lecture on the 
novelist D. H. Lawrence. Baim 
is rather familiar with this parti
cularly outstanding figure in 
20th century literature; he wrote 
his doctoral dissertion on Law
rence.
Richard OKeefe, a nationallypublished poet in his own right, 
will conclude the series with his 
talk on Robert Lowell.
Although the lectures are not 
scholarly in nature, neither are
they intended to entertain. Rath
er they aim toward the cultural
ly aware individual, giving him 
information, guidelines by which 
to judge literature, and an idea 
of points to look for in plays, 
poetry, and prose.
John A. Hart, as chairman of 
the committee that has sponsor
ed the lecture series since 1948, 
has devoted a great deal of time 
and energy to organization and 
execution of the lectures. The 
series is now open to any in
terested members of the other 
departments of the University, 
as well as to students and offcampus visitors. In fact, atten
dance by students and faculty 
outside the English Department 
is encouraged. When the series 
was first initiated, however, it 
was for the benefit of English 
Department Faculty and their 
spouses only. Gradually the 
audience has expanded to in
clude any others who are inter
ested.
Traditionally, a lecture on 
Shakespeare was included in the 
series. This year, however, since 
Drama is not doing a Shakes
pearian play, the fourth talk 
will be omitted. Even so, the 
series promises to be of great 
interest, dealing as it does with 
three such significant figures 
in 20th century literature as 
ONeill, Lawrence, and Lowell, 
and presented as it is by three 
such well-informed faculty mem
bers as Cottrell, Baim, and 
OKeefe.
CARE Needs Aid 
To Continue Program
An emergency appeal for pub
lic support is being made by 
CARE to enable the non-profit 
agency to continue its relief 
program in South Vietnam. 
CARE officials estimate $500,-
000 is needed to support its aid 
program for refugee children 
in the next 12 months.
The Vietnam Relief Fund, 
which has provided $1,548,310 
in food and supplies in the past 
two years, is now almost ex
hausted. The Fund is specially 
planned to relive the most press
ing human needs of the chil
dren: food, clothing, blankets 
and medical supplies.
CARE also provides relief 
packages to help refugee fam
ilies become self-supporting. 
These packages contain hand 
tools, irrigation equipment, tool 
kits for carpenters, masons and 
blacksmiths . . . even livestock 
to supply herds for fresh meat. 
CARE aid, administered by se
ven American representatives, 
reaches every province of the 
war-torn country. The agency 
also sponsors visits by Amer
ican medical and surgical spe
cialists who volunteer through 
MEDICO, a service of CARE.
All donations are tax deduc
tible and can be sent to CAREs 
local office, Kaufmanns De
partment Store, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Panel Discusses 
Campus Apathy
The general impression of 
C-MU students is that they are 
apathetic, although not neces
sarily alienated. There seem to 
be three major sources for this 
.apathy: 1) the goals stressed by 
the university culture; 2) the 
goals stressed by Amerioan 
culture; and 3) the goals de
fined by the student culture.
This problem of apathy will 
be defined and discussed by a 
panel of students, headed by 
Dr. Peggy Sanday, an anthro
pologist, is a part of the Aliena
tion and Iidentity Symposium, 
which is being sponsored by the 
YM & WCA through the Office 
of Religious Affairs.
The students on the open pan
el will come from all schools 
of the university. In discussing 
the phenomenon of student 
apathy they will in fact be 
studying themselves.
The idea for an apathy sem
inar came from Dr. Sandays 
anthropology class. As a part of 
this study of the effects of cul
ture on personality, the student 
were asked to write papers on 
their own observations of the 
causes of apathy in the Amer
ican culture.
The initial papers brought 
such a strong reaction that se
veral students did additional re
search on apathy on the C-MU 
campus. Although the results
oi the research were invalid, due 
its brevity, the interest gener
ated by the project was suffi
cient to extend the idea to the 
campus community for discus
sion.
Apathy I and II, two open

Language Majors 
Lack Fluency
WASHINGTON (CP)  Al
though most college foreign lan
guage majors can learn to read 
and write one language ade
quately they still do not speak 
it fluently.
In a study of 2,700 students 
who graduated from college in 
1965, the average major in 
French, Spanish, German, Ita
lian, or Russian could speak the 
language he was majoring in 
only slightly better than what 
the US State Departments For
eign Service Institute calls lim
ited working proficiency.
But except for Russian ma
jors, who made a poor showing 
overall, more than half the stu
dents could read and write the 
language they studied at a level 
the researchers considered satis
factory.
The study was conducted by 
by a research team from Har
vard under a grant from the US 
Office of Education. About 24 
per cent of all 1965 seniors who 
majored in those five languages 
were tested.
The study showed that the 
best-trained language graduates 
cafe from large colleges and 
universities, and that private in
stitutions generally produced 
better linguists than public ones. 
The private schools superiority 
is partly as a result of the fact 
that students at the larger, pri
vate schools spent more time 
abroad than students at public 
schools.
The worst performances on 
the tests came from those who 
plan to teach foreign languages 
in high school, while those who 
planned to teach in college 
were strikingly superior,"
Tax Advice by 
Internal Revenue
Taxpayers seeking profession
al help in preparing their 1967 
Federal income tax returns 
should select only qualified and 
reputable advisors.
Regardless of who prepares 
the return taxpayers are respon
sible for all entries and support
ing documents, and for the full 
payment of additional tax, pen
alties, and interest, H. Alan 
Long, District Director of Inter
nal Revenue for Western Pen
nsylvania said today.
While the majority of tax 
practitioners are competent and 
honest, Mr. Long alerted tax
payers to these potential dan
ger signals:
Beware of the expert who 
will not be around to answer 
your questions after the return 
has been prepared and filed;
Never sign a blank return 
and leave it with a stranger;
Do not sign a tax return pre
pared in pencil, since the return 
can be changed later;
Avoid the advisor who guar
antees refunds, wants a per
centage of the refund, or sup
posedly knows all the angles.
Be on your guard if it is sug
gested that your refund check 
be mailed to the practitioners 
address.
Mr. Long siaid a professional 
assistor should sign, on the line 
provided, the tax returns that he 
prepares and you should record 
his name and address for future 
reference.

Senator Edwards
(Continued from Page 1)
IJ. S. foreign policy, with parti
cular emphasis on the situation 
in Vietnam. Edwards feels that 
the U. S. has ignored legitimate 
offers for negotiations from 
the North Vietnamese and has 
instead carried the war to ex
tremes which have endangered 
the U. S. position in the world 
and have taken money and in
terest away from the pressing 
social problems in this country.
According to Edwards, Mc
Carthy,s solution to the Viet
nam war is to get out "with 
honor and without abandoning 
our obligations. Congressman 
Edwards did not explain just 
how such a withdrawal could be 
affected while mainatining these 
goals but indicated that the im
mediate step should be to en
gage in peace negotiations, un
conditionally, with the North 
Vietnamese.
The Vienam war is the Drey
fus case of America. Edwards 
feels that the U. S. has reached 
a point at which it must take 
a hard look at its goals and 
policies and extricate itself 
from a war which is consuming 
a tremendous quantity of money 
and human lives. Today there 
are over 500,000 American Men 
there. Each year we are losing
9,000 lives and spending over
30 billionI dont hesitate to 
predict that these numbers will 
increase. The disastrous effect 
of this war on both foreign and 
domestic policies has become 
dominant and all pervasive.
Edwards stressed McCarthys 
idealism in dealing with the 
problems that face the nation. 
Our candidate is a man who 
believes in Americas responsi
bility to the world, but not in 
violent war against backward, 
primitive people; who sees 
Americas unique standing in 
the world community stemming 
from its arsenal of ideas not 
of kill power.
Thus Edwards sees McCarthy 
as a strong leader who can 
reassert traditional American 
values. Edwards emphasized a 
strong similarity between Mc
Carthy and Adlai Stevenson. 
There was a man who talked 
sense to the American people. 
There was one man who said: 
This is a time for self-examina
tion. This is a time for us to 
take stock. This is a time to de
cide where we are and where 
we are going. Edwards feels 
that McCarthy is a similar lead
er who can assert the ideals of, 
in Edwards opinion, the major
ity of Americans.
Edwards sees McCarthy as be
ing in the tradition of Kennedy. 
In Edwards view the present 
situation is the fault of the incumbant not the preceding ad
ministration. Let there be no 
mistake about it. This war is 
Mr. Johnsons. Furthermore, 
McCarthy supports the domestic 
policies of Kennedy and believes 
that the present war expendi
ture is detracting from needed 
programs at home. Edwards 
stated that an end to the war 
at home would allow the gov
ernment to again concentrate on 
the problems of the city and 
race relations, which have been 
obscured by the importance 
placed on winning in Vietnam.
Edwards was asked if McCar
thy would have any basis for a 
campaign if President Johnson 
were to reverse his policy tow
ard Vietnam, end bombing and
other military acts, and go to 
the bargaining table. In re
sponse Edwards said, Both Mr. 
McCarthy and I would be de
lighted if this would happen.
In the Friday press confer
ence Edwards was asked some 
rather pointed questions as to 
whether the people of the United 
States are being lied to. Cer
tainly there is a credibility gap, 
he stated, but I would not use 
a term as strong as lying. He 
indicated, nevertheless that the 
recent call-up of the reserves 
came not so much because of 
the seizure of the Pueblo as be
cause the reserves are needed 
for the Vietnam effort and the 
Pueblo incident presented a good 
excuse.
The question was raised as to 
what would be the political sig
nificance of a new Democratic 
candidate rising in opposition to 
Johnson. Edwards indicated 
that by working within the par
ty, McCarthy can be promoted 
as a candidate who represents 
the consensus of American opin
ion. In his evening speech he 
went on to assert that the war 
itself is responsible for spliting the Democratic party. We 
are here to end the division by 
ending this war.
Edwards stated, in reply to a 
direct question, that if Robert 
Kennedy had declared his can
didacy that he would have wel
comed a Kennedy/McCarthy 
ticket, but that since Kennedy 
has not done so he has placed 
his support behind McCarthy. 
When asked if he would support 
Johnson were he nominated, Ed
wards replied that is too early 
to make decisions like that.
Edwards appeared very opti
mistic about McCarthys chances 
of winning the Democratic nom
ination^ He did not believe that 
the press has portrayed an ac
curate picture of McCarthys 
chances, recalling Trumans 
election in 1948 despite the over
whelming predictions to the contraary by the press.
Edwards sees a great degree 
of support for McCarthy com
ing from young people, the 
clergy, the minorities and the 
intellectuals. Although the lead
ers of labor have been tradition
ally associated with the Demo
cratic power structure, Edwards 
asserted that McCarthy will 
draw strong support from la
bors rank and file. Moreover, 
Edwards contended that once 
they realize that public opinion 
is behind McCarthy, the leaders 
of the Democratic party will 
provide him with the support 
heretofore not forthcoming.
Edwards thus sees McCarthy 
as a representative of Amer
ican idealism and true humanitarianism, a s distinguished 
from that which is only a coverup for self interest. Edwards 
believes that McCarthy can pro
vide the leadership to extricate 
the nation from the moral dil
emmas it finds itself in
In his words: Our cam
paign rejects the myth that the 
peoples choice would be turned 
down by a Democratic conven
tion.
Our campaign reaffirms our 
faith in the political system of 
our country. It says that the 
Democratic Party can provide 
the opportunity for choice. We 
are here today to guarantee 
that it does provide that choice.
Tickets Available 
For The Prodigal
The Drama Department will 
present The Prodigal by Jack 
Richardson, directed by Word 
Baker, in the Carnegie Theater 
Feb. 28-March 8. Tickets will be 
distributed to the general stu
dent body on Tuesday, Feb. 20, 
at 3:30 pm, Room 108, Fine Arts 
Building.
Walter Kerr has called The 
Prodigal, a truly remarkable 
first play and his opinion was 
born out by other of the plays 
critics who awarded Richardson 
the Vernon Rice and Obie 
Awards for the excellence of his 
writing. The basic theme of The 
Prodigal is the great Orestes 
legend dealing with idealism, po
litical opportunism and bloody 
venegence. But it is the play
wrights wry, throughly modem 
and arresting variations on this 
theme that have so captivated 
the critics and the public.

You Cant Take It with You. 
On Feb. 27, a Tuesday, there will 
be a special showing (for mem

Gladys Schmitt

tdve work for the creative in
dividual, she emphasized the dif
ference between that which is 
created and that which is con
structed. The artist is some 
one beyond a mere craftsman. 
Creativity, irrespective of de
mand and will, flows from an
other mind somewhere between 
the rational and the unconsci
ous. The mystery of the crea
tive process became apparent as 
Miss Schmitt related her own 
personal experience of being 
emotionally involved in her mo
thers death while, at the exact 
same time, experiencing a flow 
of creativity which sent her to 
work on Rembrandt. Adversity, 
she believes, can sometimes help 
the flow of art, and, in the end, 
the artist, through his work, can 
find an emotional control.
Who are Gladys Schmitts 
characters and auience? She re
marked that she often incorpor
ates actual people that she has 
known Into her novels. With the 
belief that a literary work is 
never a self dialogue, she 
writes towards particular peo
ple. The artist serfcs an audi
ence, and for Gladys Schmitt, 
this audience can never be an 
unknown posterity.
A Conversation with Gladys 
Schmit concluded with the 
reading of two of Miss Schmitts 
sonnets, followed by a questionand-answer period. The focus 
had been on the world of the 
artist; and the audience left with 
a quite unique acquaintance with 
this world. Refreshments were 
then served in Skibo Lobby at 
which time the audience could 
talk with Miss Schmitt, Dean 
Mullins, and various members 
of the faculty.

How I Won the War
... by TIMOTHY BAY
How I Won the War is an anti-war film, but it is totally unlike 
most films of this type. It is an oddball burlesque vision of the Second 
World War; kind of like an English servicemans version of Catch 
22.
Director Richard Lesters basic technique is to alternate, with 
disquieting abruptness, humor, and horror. The shock of certain scenes 
gains by contrast; hilarity gives way to pathos.
The film is mainly a flashback reminiscence delivered by Lieu
tenant Goodbody of his experiences in that war. Ernest Goodbody in 
the opening scenes is a callow and inept officer who tries to do 
everything by the book and fill the role of an authoritarian leader. 
The other officers in this film are portrayed as either bunglers or self
deluded strategists. The supreme comic figure, Musketeer Juniper, a 
demented court jester in uniform, is seen at the end, sitting at head
quarters in a strait jacket devising grand strategy. Goodbody is given 
command of a platoon with instructions to land in North Africa. His 
assignment: to prepare a cricket pitch behind enemy lines for the 
advancing British troups. The ludicrousness of this situation is carried 
out in the style of the entire picture. In one marvelouds deadpan 
scene Goodbody advances with his motley platoon on a huge enemy 
encampment. The German troops outnumber Goodbodys men many 
times over. Instantly, they surrender to the straggling faced English 
soldiers, while the march from Bridge an the River Kwai swells in 
the background. The mock heroics of most anti-war films is roundly 
attacked in War; on a certain level, it is as much against other 
war movies as it is against war. But there is really no mistaking 
Lester's basic intent: to show the moral, as well as physical destruc
tion of war.
Lieutenant Goodbody has by the end of the film survived physic
ally the effects of the war, but not without an inevitable spiritual 
loss. In 1945, he bribes a sympathetic appearing German officer to 
hand over a strategic bridge. He has won the war, and leads his men 
over the bridge in solemn pantomine of a victory procession.
How I Won the War is filled with Richard Lesters (Hard 
Days' Night, Help, The Knack) distinct brand of filmmaking; quite 
consciously, Lester makes us aware of his technique, and in a Brechtian fashion, of the artificality of the experienceat one point the 
camera draws away from a scene to a movie theatre, where two 
women are seen watching and commenting on the movie.
Michael Crawford, in the focal role of Goodbody develops bril
liantly from bumptious naivete to a quiet cynicism; Alexander Know, 
Michael Hordern, and Jack MacGowran, in their less demanding 
roles, are very fine. John Lennon in a surprisingly smaller part than 
I expected, was characteristically wry; although hardly on the same 
level as the other actors.
How I Won the War has a simple message, but one that bares 
repeating. It is at times brilliant, highly imaginative, puzzling, but 
it does not wallow in sentimentality like many anti-war movies; and 
in the end, it has an extraordinary impact.
Going from the sublime to the ridiculous, I think that Valley of 
the Dollsnow well entrenched in a theatre downtowndeserves at 
least a footnote in this column. On the positive side, the film has 
some fine photography which is wasted on the cardboard characters; 
some fine unconsciously humorous bits; and as evidence of Holly
wood s courageousness, a tcxen homosexual with the exotic name 
of Ted Casablanca. In general, the film excels in what James Agee 
termed the intricately bad. For those who have read the book, 
this forewarning is unnecessary; for those who havent, you really 
arent missing much.

Wait Until Dark
by TONY LAWRENCE
i? If Hitchcock had made Wait Until Dark it would be a lot better 
than the Mel Ferrer - Terence Young offering/ currently showing at 
the Chatham Cinema. As it is the film is a slightly above average 
thriller offering a couple of genuine, tingling surprises.
Susy (Audrey Hepburn) is blind from a car accident and has 
been married to Sam (Efrem Zimbalist) for about a year. There, 
through almost preposterous circumstances, is a doll that Sam gets 
possession of and contains an immense amount of heroine. Three 
gangsters (Richard Crenna, Jack Weston and Alan Arkin) are hired 
*to find the doll by underestimating Suzys perceptions and capabili
ties and meet the usual fate.
Director Terence Young has done only half of his job creditably.
His past fame from directing the James Bond pictures, or at least 
some of them, is rightfully due. He handles action very well and has 
used precise timing in the movement for good effect. But the more 
subtle moments are rather dull and routine. Even he cannot handle 
the vapid, pedestrian screenplay by Robert and Jane-Howard Car
rington.
Weston, Crenna and Zimbalist go through their paces well and 
the former two being properly sinister. But it is Arkin who unques
tionably makes the film. His creation of the psycotic, pill-popping 
fiend is a work of art. He portrays three parts in the picture and 
all three add to an uncommon insight as to what makes him tick. 
His adjustments, mannerisms and completeness of character are 
worth seeing. Audrey Hepburn is as good as she can be I suppose. 
It's as if the film industry were saying* Well gang, its Audrey Hepf burn againonly this time shes blind. Her performance is generally 
inconsistent. I wonder how she went about preparing for the role. 
She is, at times, almost too perceptive and too full of indicating the 
blindness and is thus, not altogether believable.
Photography by Charles Lang and Editing by Gene Milford are 
fine and Set Decorator George James Hopkins has contributed an 
exceptionally good set. Henry Mancinis sound track is undistin
guished.

Suggestions Given 
For Apathy Problem
by Gordon Cohn
Two weeks ago C-MU sent 
Jacquelin Pratt, Perry Cohen 
and Gordon Cohn to the Civitas 
Conference at Cornell. The pur
pose of the Conference was to 
examine the problem of student 
apathy on college campuses and 
to suggest programs to combat 
the problem.
Most of the programs discuss
ed during the conference were 
aimed at involving students in 
projects which were similar to 
the Peace Corps, or which in
volved participation in commun
ity or social action projects as 
a part of the students educa
tion. The aim was to increase 
the students sense of social 
awareness.
The main problem with pro
jects of this nature is that they 
tend to attract students with 
already strong humanistic atti
tudes, rather than the engineer 
or the art student. This is due 
in part to the necessarily high 
professional and technical orien
tation of these students. They 
have a very limited amount of 
timeboth in class and to their 
ownin which to develop this 
social awareness. There is no 
clear-cut solution to the prob
lem.
With this in mind Student Con
gress has created a standing 
committee, the Social Services 
Committee, to expand the cam
pus resources for student social 
involvement. Activities will in
clude service projects like the 
Cal Tech smog control project, 
tutorials, development theatre 
programs with ghetto students, 
and more seminars and speak
ers similar to the Alienation 
and Identity Symposium now 
being sponsored by the YM & 
WCA.
The committee needs the as
sistance of all students inter
ested in forming and taking 
part in a well-planned program 
to develop social awareness 
on the campus. The Social Ser
vices Committee is open to all 
members of the C-MU commun
ity who are concerned that 
modern man is becoming too in
sensitive, depersonalized, and 
narrow. The committee wishes 
to involve the members of the

Apathy Seminar 
To Examine Cultures
A students apathetic feelings 
about his university experience 
may, according to Dr. Peggy 
Sanday, Assistant Professor of 
Anthropology, indicate some 
stifling pressures in his environ
ment. To understand these pres
sures Dr. Sanday recommends 
examining three cultures 
which affect the student: 1) the 
American culturefelt through 
goals stressed by the family; 2) 
the University cultureexperi
enced through goals stressed by 
administration and faculty; and
3) the student culture  exper
ienced through goals stressed 
by peers. Today, these cultures 
often reward social and biologi
cal competence without valuing 
the whole unique individual in
cluding his intellectual and per
sonal growth. The result of 
such one-sided emphasis may be 
to stifle the individual.
Student apathy and the pres
sures that produce it will be 
discussed in a group meeting 
with Dr. Sanday, Wednesday, 
February 21st, at 6:30 pm in 
room 40 Skibo. The seminar, 
Apathy II, will include a panel 
of Dr. Sandays students and 
will be open to any interested 
member of the C-MU commun
ity as part of the Alienation 
and Identity Symposium.

Incident Indicative 
of Need to Clarify
by Sue Gordon
A lew weeks ago the Suffolk 
^ounty Narcotics squad invaded 
the Stony Brook campus of the 
State University of New York 
and launched a coordinated military-style, predawn raid in stu
dent dorms, off-campus apart
ments and private homes. The 
outcome was 40 students and 10 
non-students arrested, plus 
storms of protests.
Police had deployed two 
agents on the campus since fall, 
disguised as drug-using trans
ients. These agents supplied the 
necessary information to the 
police, which resulted in the 
compiling of a dossier on each 
suspect. After months of pa
tient information gathering, 200 
police swarmed over the area, 
Arresting students in charges 
of selling or possessing drugs.
Not only was there a certain 
amount of melodrama in the 
dawn crackdown, but neither 
the campus police nor the ad
ministration had been notified of 
the coming raid, while nearly 
a dozen newsmen arrived on the 
scene fully briefed by the police.
* Here is where the cries of dis
pleasure were mounted. Stu
dents complained of Gestapo 
tactics and a faculty resolution 
deplored the polices tactics, 
charging that the methods em
ployed were more suitable to 
quelling a rebellion than to 
arresting peaceful students.
The Stony Brook affair spur
red national interests. Hearings 
of the Joint Legislative Commit
tee on Higher Education began 
in New York City to examine 
the Stony Brook drug issue. 
The Washington meeting of the 
National Student Association re
sulted in a proposal presented 
to the school administration, 
which may establish a preceodent-setting procedure for deal
ing with student drug involve
ment. The program developed 
for Stony Brook views student 
drug involvement as a plea for 
help similar to that of an at
tempted suicide which should 
be dealt with through psychia
tric counseling.
The Stony Brook pot bust un^ covered basic issues that are 
bound to trouble universities 
long after pot goes out of style. 
Just where do the rights of a 
college student begin and end? 
Five national education organ
izations joined forces this past 
summer to help clarify the 
confusion. A Joint Statement on 
the Rights and Freedoms of Stu
dents was written and is now 
^moving closer to formal adop
tion. One problem is how well 
it will be adopted by college 
administrations, pushed by stu
dents, and enforced by the na
tional organizations. The second 
problem is the content and word
ing of the statement itself.
On many issues it follows up 
strong assertions of student 
rights with vague passages that 
give administrators an out. And 
it is, by its own admission, a 
minimal document.
The fact that it calls only for 
minimal rights and freedoms for 
students is likely to be ignored 
Oi' forgotten by many adminis
trations, especially those at 
schools where even these min/ri imal standards would mean 
revolutionary change. On those 
campuses students who want 
to see the Joint Statement adopt
ed will have to emphasize that, 
since it includes only minimal 
student rights, that the college
The Arena 
Eugene McCarthy: Lord of LaMancha
by Len Wanetik
After President Kennedys death, and to those who knew him 
well in life, it became known that his favorite musical was Camelot, 
and that the title song was also one of his favorites. Perhaps the 
play and tune represented the idyllic setting which he was attempt
ing to produce in this country.
In the Presidential brouhaha which surrounds us today, there is 
one man who best approaches the Kennedy spirit. He is Eugene Mc
Carthy, the man who is challenging Lyndon Johnson from within the 
ranks of the Democratic Party. Unfortunately, the play which seems 
to be applicable in this case is not Camelot, but The Man of La 
Mancha.
To say that McCarthy is committing political suicide to reach 
what many consider to be an unreachable star would be a gross 
understatement. To say that he is doing it for the purpose he avows 
and with sincerity seldom found in humans, let alone politicians, 
would be an even greater understatement.
The Senator worked closely with Adlai Stevenson. He was the 
man who nominated Stevenson in the 1960 convention. He is rational 
in his attitude toward our role in World affairs. To quote Don Ed
wards, congressman from California and a prime backer of McCarthy, 
he believes in Americas responsibilities to the world, but not in 
violent war against backward, primitive people . . McCarthy re
jects isolationism. He declares that America must be a part of all 
the worldin real U.N. participationin tradein cooperationin 
cultural exchange.
Most of the candidates policy statements are couched in terms 
of foreign policy. The war in Viet Nam is of major importance. It 
is expected that Senator McCarthy's expressed concern for humanity 
will take the place of definite domestic programs.
It is in the area of politics that the analogy to Don Quixote be
comes quite clear. McCarthy has picked a considerable windmill 
to attack. He gives one the feeling that he is engaging in a glorious 
quest to rid the United States government of evil. He is doing this 
without personal concern, of course. As Don Quixote states in the 
musical, my destiny calls and I go. The wild winds of Fortune will 
carry me onward, whither so ever they blow.
McCarthy has his Sanchos. They are the citizen politicians 
who have been circulating petitions, drumming up support, and 
manning his headquarters. Much as Sancho Panza did, they are 
trying to do their best to aid their master. But it should be remem
bered that Sancho was not really a squire, as Don Quixote thought. 
He was a peasant, and a real squire would have eaten him alive 
in the performance of squires functions. In like maimer, McCarthys 
main weakness lies in the fact that he is fighting a machine politi
cian. To do this, he has gathered an extremely human army to aid 
him.
True, grass roots support is vital to a candidate. True, La 
Guardia managed to upset the machine in New York. But grass roots 
support is best directed by an experienced politician. La Guardia 
worked from within. The machine elected him and then he destroyed 
it. The machine helped La Guardia gain popular support, and then 
he took over control of that support. What is to be noted here is that 
he worked from within the structure, while Senator McCarthy is 
working from without.
The thrust of this all can be summarized as follows. McCarthy 
is attacking an experienced politician with a well oiled political ma
chine behind him. To do this, McCarthy has a group of inexperi
enced but sincere supporters. We shall have to wait to see who 
will win.
Until then, we can take these words from The Man of La 
Mancha as McCarthys battle cry. Hear me heathens and wizards 
and servants of sin/ All your dastardly doing are past/ For a holy 
endeavours about to begin/ And virtue shall triumph at last.
WALLYS
should adopt and perhaps do a 
little more.
Of course, there are many 
strong passages, including those 
dealing with access to higher 
education, freedom in the class
rooms, student records, and free
dom of association. These guar
antee such rights as freedom 
from racial discrimination in ad
missions policies, the right of 
dissent in the classroom, pro
tection from unfair grading, cinfidentiality of student records, 
and the freedom to form what
ever organizations students 
wish. The statement also re
quires that academic and dis
ciplinary records be kept sep
arately, that disciplinary records 
of student political activity or 
views be kept. It prohibits ad
visors from controlling the poli
cies of student organizations and 
says universities may not re
quire membership lists from or
ganizations.
On demonstrations, it makes 
no mention of disruptive pro. 
tests, such as those which have 
been directed at campus recruit
ers, but does say that students 
always have the right to protest 
peacefully.
Other sections of the Joint 
Statement are not as strong as 
many students might wish:
PreambleThe Preamble typ
ifies the entire document. It be
gins with a strong assertion 
that as members of the Aca
demic Community, students 
should be encouraged to develop 
the capacity for critical judge
ment and to engage in a sus
tained and independent search 
for truth. Then comes the way 
out for a college president who 
likes to run his campus with a 
firm hand: instituted proced
ures for achieving their pur
poses may vary from campus to 
campus. . .
SpeakersStudents should be 
allowed to invite any speakers 
they wish and university proced
ures should not be used to keep 
speakers from speaking, accord
ing to the statement. The one 
vague sentence here says that 
administrations should make 
sure that the occasion is con
ducted in a manner appropriate 
to an academic community. Al
though that seems unclear, NSA 
President Ed Schwartz says in 
his report to NSAs summer

The Campus Bookstor and Its 
Future
Mr. Charles Floyd, Manager 
of the Bookstore, was intro
duced and presented a brief 
picture of the Bookstores pres
ent and possible future. Mr. 
Floyd point out that the recent 
remodeling of the the Book
store provided an additional 
1000 square feet of badly need
ed space, bringing the total to 
almost 5,000 square feet. Some 
of the advantages gained 
through enlargement and better 
utilization of the existing area 
are: Each buyers office is now 
located in the center of his 
area of responsibility; new, mod
ern lighting system provides 
better visibility; larger tradebook and text-book sales-areas; 
security lockers for safeguard
ing students personal belong
ings while they shop; air handl
ing provides a better atmosphere 
in the store; improved office 
facilities for record keeping and 
a private office for the man
ager; installation of five modem 
greeting card units; two cash 
register stations for faster cus
tomer checkout
In addition to the physical 
improvements, a number of im
provements have occurred in 
customer services, i.e., self-ser
vice in the Art Department and 
faster checkout service.
Mr. Floyd went on to say that 
he nourished a perpetual hope 
that the Bookstore can relocate 
in more adequate quarters, and 
that on at least three occasions 
substantial analyses coupled 
with recommendations for a 
new store have been prepared 
and presented for consideration. 
It has been recommended that 
the Bookstore should be located 
in its own building, or at least 
in a newly constructed wing of 
an existing structure, to provide 
for future physical expansion. 
It has also been recommended 
that when a new store reached 
the planning stage it would be 
a good idea for an ad hoc com
mittee of faculty members and 
students to be appointed to re
view with the Bookstore Mana
ger the services which should 
be offered. Mr. Floyd suggested 
the following possible commod
ities and services: text-books, 
hard-cover trade books, paper
backs, school and office supplies, 
art and engineering materials, 
greeting cards, writing equipment, college jewelry, novelties, 
soft goods, sporting goods, so
cial stationary, art prints, drug 
sundries, cosmetics, candy, to
bacco, records, gifts, photogra
phic supplies and photo develop
ing, magazines, check cashing 
service, cap and gown service, 
and a special order service.
A general discussion of the 
Bookstore followed Mr. Floyds 
operation of the Bookstore: (1)
Not only are the additional 
commodities suggested above 
desired by the students, they 
also would help pay the way 
and (2) if the Bookstore should 
become public, as one mem
ber suggested, a variety of tax 
problems would arise.
In his closing remarks Mr. 
Floyd indicated that he and his 
staff are willing and, hopefully, 
prepared to operate the kind of 
Bookstore the faculty and stu
dents want in order to best im
plement the educational goals 
of the University.
Project Upward Bound
The following memorandum 
from the Project Upward Bound 
Academic Policy Committee 
(John Sandberg, Chairman; 
Shirley Angrist, David Fowler, 
Lee Goldman, Richard Longini, 
Richard MacCamy, and Robert 
Morgan) was distributed to the 
Academic Affairs Committee:
Approximately 10,000 high 
school students are enrolled in 
Upward Bound programs in col
leges and universities across 
the country this year. The stu
dents are selected for participa
tion in Upward Bound programs 
by teachers, counselors, and 
others who believe that they 
have the potential to profit from 
special programs designed to 
help them overcome their cult
ural and educational disadvan
tages.
Some Upward Bound gradu
ates are fully esuipped acdemically and motivating to succeed 
in almost any college or uni
versity without further assistence other than financial help. 
They make good College Board 
scores and they have good high 
school records. Most Upward 
Bound students, however, do not 
possess the kinds of credentials 
that admissions officers look 
for. They have poor high school 
records and they dont do parti
cularly well on college entrance 
examinations. Nevertheless, they
are capable of doing college 
work if they could get in and 
get enough help during and/or 
immediately prior to the first 
year.
At the present time only three 
graduates of Upward Bound 
programs are enrolled at Carnegie-Mellon, none of whom are 
really high risk students. The 
Academic Policy Committee of 
Project Upward Bound believes 
that Camegie-Mellon can and 
should do more than it has done 
to help break the vicious cycle 
of deprivation and exclusion 
which Commissioner Howe des
cribes. Specifically the Commit
tee recommends that no less 
than three per cent of the fresh
man class in each college (no 
less than 15 freshmen per col
lege) be selected from the pop
ulation of Upward Bound stu
dents described above. Some of 
these students could come from 
our own Upward Bound pro
gram, others from Pitt and 
Mount Mercy, and the remainder 
from Upward Bound programs
at other colleges and univers
ities.
The meeting adjourned at 5:30 
pm.
Almost without exception 
these students would resuire fin
ancial assistance greater than 
that of the typical freshmar]

How would you like to jump 
into your career with both feet... and be on the 
run from the beginning?
Western Electric has a unique pro
gram of individual development for 
those interested in a management 
careera high-risk, high-reward 
program that offers you one of the 
most dramatic opportunities in 
business. You are put in a man

required to handle high-level trans
actions all by yourself. If you do 
your job well, you'll have begun a 
managerial career in the growing 
communications industry. If the 
demands of the job prove too 
stringent (and they will for some), 
then both of us will benefit by 
learning this before a significant
investment in time has been made.
Whatever your background 
engineering, science, business, lib
eral artsthere may be a place 
for you in the College Graduate 
Program at Western Electric. Your 
college record must indicate a 
high level of scholastic achieve
ment and the ability and initiative 
for effective leadershipand you 
must be interested in a manage
ment career.
If you feel you qualify, be sure 
to arrange for a personal inter
view when the Bell System recruiting team visits your campus on 
Feb. 22-23. And before that, get

Tartan Shooters Win Two 
Record Is Now 7-3
e The C-MU rifle team picked 
up two victories and a loss since 
Christmas recess. Just before 
Christmas vacation the Tartans 
romped over Clarion, and two 
weeks ago beat Indiana, and in 
another math with Clarion suf
fered their thrid loss. The rifle 
team now has a 7-3 record.
Clarion journeyed to Tech 
for the match on their last day 
of school before Christmas re
cess but despite the approaching 
gaiety the Tartan rifleers main
tained seriousness and shot an 
amazing 1268 score. Team totals 
were C-MU1268, Clarion 1204, 
with Mankovich262, Westtake 
256, Sandgren252, Boynton250, and Roth248 as top five, 
w On Feb. 3, C-MU met Penn 
state and Indiana in a dual 
, meet. The Penn State  C-MU 
match was only an exhibition 
match and the State rifleman 
showed the Tartans what good 
shooting was all about. Tech

Meisters two free throws and 
Hummels two pointer gave the 
Tartans an early 4-2 lead. Lang 
saved a possible basket by West
minister by blocking a short 
jump shot by Mike DrespLing. 
When Westministers excellent 
shooters began to operate ef
fectively, the Tartans were only 
able to get a minimum number 
of shots at the basket since num
erous CMU passes were inter
cepted by the Titans, especially 
by their quick guards, Boston 
and McConnell. Long jump 
shots by Meister and Houser 
gave the Tartans 8 points mid
way through the first half while 
Westminister added 11 points to 
hold a five point lead. The Tar
tans remained close as West
minister led 20-16 and began to 
put on a full court press. The 
Titans exploded at this point for 
15 points while CMU could only
scored a victory over Indiana 
in the C-MUIndiana match.
The Penn State shooters 
stomped C-MU, 1311 to 1270. 
May I just mention thaat the 
1270 score by Tech was one of 
the highest shot in the season 
in the WPIRL (Western Penn
sylvania Intercollegiate Rifle 
League) League season, so this 
can exemplify the ability of the 
Penn State shooters.
Carnegie rolled over Indiana, 
1270 to 1235, with the C-MU 
scores as. Wolf 263, Roth 259, 
Mankovich 258, Sandgien 256, 
and Arnold 234. A special com
mendation goes to Harry Wolf 
for his superb marksmanship, 
and high score for the match.
This past Saturday saw C-MU 
at Clarion. The final score was 
Clarion 1252, C-MU 1183. The 
Tartan high were Mankovich  
256, Westtake 245, Beran 236, 
Boynton 229, and Clayton 220.

put in two foul shots. This set
the half time score at 35-18.
The second half was easy for 
Westminister as they outscored 
CMU 34-28 to win the game 69- 
46. Tempers flared at two points 
in the game when the official 
called technical fouls on Barry 
Hummel and the Titans George 
Zepernick for protesting his 
calls. When the Titans contin
ued too use the press in the sec
ond half, the Tartans quickly 
moved the ball over the mid-line 
with perfect execution; how
ever, by then it was too late 
since the damage was done in 
the first half. Mark Lang paced 
the Tartans with 20 points and 
13 rebounds. Mike Drespling led 
all scorers with 23 points for 
Westminister.
The bus ride to Cleveland Sat
urday was three hours long but
the return trip must have seem
ed much longer to the Tartans 
who lost to Adelbert 72-70 in 
double overtime. (In fact, the 
team did not return until Sun
day afternoon.)
At halftime, CMU led by five, 
29-24. By the middle of the sec
ond half, the Tartans held what 
seemed to be a commanding fif
teen point lead 50-35. However, 
the Tartans were able to put 
only 6 points on the scoreboard 
in the final nine minutes of reg
ulated time, and when Jeff Mish
kin scored for the opposition 
with 14 seconds remaining, the 
score was tied at 56.
Bill Abraham scored near the 
end of the five minute overtime 
for CMU to knot the score at 
63-63 and send the game into a 
second overtime period. With 
the score tied 70-70 and 6 sec
onds left, guard Steve Seeling 
calmly sank two clutch free 
throws to wrap up the comefrom-behind victory. Mark 
Lang had another 20 point 
evening. Center Bill Rogers led 
the victors with 23 points.
This game marked the fifth 
time this season in which a 
CMU basketball game was de
cided by one or two points. The 
Tartans have won two of these 
five pressure games and lost the 
only other overtime game of the 
season, which was against Ge
neva.
Penn State invades the Tech 
campus tonight. Led by guard 
Tom Daley and high scoring forward Jeff Pearson, the Nittany 
Lions will give the Tartans a 
rough night. Their center, Bill 
Stansfield is listed as 6 8. Penn 
State generally employs a 2-3 
zone defense and likes to use 
the press. Saturday night, CMU

Blast Skibo Rule
Editor, The Tartan:
I was disappointed but not 
surprised to learn in last weeks 
Tartan of Mr. McFeelys new 
ruling that Skibo is henceforth 
closed to non-C-MU personnel. 
His edict, which would require 
everyone who wishes to use Ski
bo to present his I D., is ridi
culous and probably unenforce
able.
Evidently Mr. McFeelys sensi
tivity is affronted by the prox
imity of people who do not wear 
Brooks Bros, shirts and pennyloafers, and whose mode of be
havior is in anything but strict 
conformity with his own. If the 
first step is successful, I sup
pose his next move will be to 
erect electrified fences around 
the campus to keep us even 
safer from the dirty-uncivilizedanarchist-commie-teeny - bopperhippies. Then, when we are suf
ficiently insulted from evil 
worldly influences, it will be 
easier for McFeely and his col
leagues to take our hands 
(necks) and guide us into their 
Way-of-Truth-and-Success.
To deny non-students the use 
of Skibo is clearly a gesture di
rected toward those narrow
minded students who are, like 
McFeely, distressed to see what 
is going on in the world. It is 
precisely these people who 
should be forced to peek out of 
their campus womb and recog
nize that not everyone, indeed 
very few people, live by their 
straight and narrow standards.
Furthermore, I suspect Mr. 
McFeely will be very inconsistant in his prosecution of the new 
policy. What about the naval re
servists from down the street? 
Will they be prevented from 
using Skibo? According to Mc
Feelys letter of Feb. 7, which 
stated that the facilities were 
served for the use of C-MU per 
sonnel, the reservists should 
be denied service. I hereby rash
ly predict, however, that the 
sailors will continue to be as 
welcome in Skibo as ever. More
over, what of all the various 
community groups that use Ski
bo? I doubt that the rule will 
be applied in their case. I cer
tainly hope it is not.
Probably, then, the only group 
that will be affected by the rul
ing, if indeed any is, will be 
those younger people whose 
hair is longer than the standard 
length, and whose dress does 
not measure up to McFeelys 
clean-cut, ivy-league suavity.
If the argument is put for
ward that the rule intends to 
affect only those who cause 
trouble by being rowdy, why is 
the rule not stated like that? 
Surely rowdyness is not con
fined to non-college people. The 
statement of the rule in McFee
lys letter makes clear that he 
wants the power to close Skibo 
to anyone without an I.D. card. 
Such power would enable Mc
Feely to act according to him 
in refusing service to any non
student whose looks he disap
proved of.
I say McFeely has no right 
to such power. Hopefully the 
Skibo staff will not try to en
force. I for one, if ever con
fronted with the rule will cer
tainly refuse to cooperate by 
showing my I.D. card. If more 
people would do likewise, we 
could expose this as an unen
forceable as well as undesirable 
rule.

Upward Bound Aim 
To Break Cycle
Some Upward Bound graduates 
are fully equipped academically 
and motivationally to succeed 
in almost any college or univers
ity without further assistance 
other than financial help. They 
make good College Board scores 
and they have good high school 
records. Most Upward Bound 
students, however, do not pos
sess the kinds of credentials the 
admissions officers look for. 
They have poor high school rec
ords and they dont do particu
larly well on college entrance 
examinations. Nevetheless, they 
are capable of doing college 
work if they could get In and 
get enough help during and/or 
immediately prior to the first
year.
At the present time only three 
graduates of Upward Bound 
programs are enrolled at Car* 
negie-Mellon, none of whom are 
really high risk students. The 
Academic Policy Committee of 
Project Upward Bound believes 
that Camegie-Mellon can and 
should do more than it has done 
to help break the vicious cycle 
of deprivation and exclusion 
which Commissioner Howe des
cribes. Specifically the Commit
tee recommends that no less 
than three per cent of the fresh
man class in each college (no 
less than 15 freshmen per col
lege) be selected from the pop
ulation of Upward Bound stu
dents described above. Some of 
these students could come from 
our own Upward Bound pro
gram, others from Pitt and

der from Upward Bound pro
grams at other colleges and uni
versities.

Almost without exception 
these students would require 
financiad assistance greater than 
that of the typical freshmen. 
Additional funds would have to 
be sought from some source 
specifically to support this pro
gram. In addition, at least one 
faculty member in each college 
would have to be given time to 
work with these students dur
ing their first year on campus. 
The committe believes that 
funds could be found to support 
this effort if Carnegie-Mellon is 
willing to make the commit
ment.
Approximately 10,000 high 
school students are enrolled in 
Upward Bound programs in col
leges and universities across the 
country this year. The students 
are selected for participation 
in Upward Bound programs by 
teachers, counselors, and others 
who believe that they have the 
potential to profit from special 
programs designed to help them 
oversome their cultural and ed
ucational disadvantages.
Tri-Delt Scholarship Competition 
Held on Campus Until March 1.
Cornell U....
Volumeu67 dnls Nbr7 1)
In future issues of the Tartan, 
members of the delegation will, 
hopefully, be reporting in ia 
great deal more detail their im
pressions of the speakers and 
their experiences within the 
workshops.
Carnegie Mellon University's 
delegation returned well-fed, a 
slight bit car-sore and inspired 
to the extent that we would* 
very much like to set up a co
ordinating social service com
mittee to use the existing pro
grams to a greater extent and, 
in the future, to expand our 
campus social service projects. 
However, further discussion of 
this will be left to future art
icles.
The annual Delta Delta Delta 
Service Projects Scholarship 
Competition will be held on the 
C-MU campus from January 1 
to March 1, 1968. All full-time 
undergraduate women students 
on this campus are eligible to 
apply. Applicants should be wellqualified students, showing 
promise of valuable service in 
their chosen field and future 
communities. Academic record, 
contribution to campus life, and 
financial need are points to be 
considered.
Tni Deltas at C-MU will grant
one award of $400. All local win- | 
ners in colleges where there are 
Tri Delta chapters are automa
tically eligible for one of the 
$1000.00 National Delta Delta 
Delta Service Projects awards. 
Applications are available from 
the Director of Financial Aid, 
Dean of Women, or Cathy Cline 
(362-2728) or Chris Davis, Service Projects Chairmen of Tri 
Delta. Completed applications 
must reach the Service Projects 
Chairman of Tri Delta, the Dean

Now, that's a pretty funny thing for a i 
civilian firm to say. A boss? Right out of 
college? The first day?
But the Air Force can make such offers.
As an officer in the world's largest 
technological organization you're a 
leader. Engineer. Scientist. Administrator. 
Right where the Space Age break
throughs are happening.
Or how about the executive respon
sibility of a test pilot clocking 2,062 mph 
in a YF-12A jet?
That could be you, too.
But you don't have to be a pilot in the 
Air Force to move fast. With your college 
degree you zip into Officer Training 
School, spin out an officer, speed on 
your way as an executive, in the fore
front of modern science and technology. 
Right on the ground
The Air Force moves pretty fast.
Think it over. A man's career can 
sometimes move pretty slow.

PlayhouseThe second consecutive Pulitzer Prize play will be 
presented in the Playhouses Hamlet Street Theater beginning 
Wednesday, Feb. 28.
As the successful production of The Subject Was Roses closes 
Feb. 18, a new production filled with humor, compassion and poetry 
follows in the form of A Delicate Balance, Edward Albees finelydrawn drama.
Often regarded as Albees best and most mature play, A Deli
cate Balance concerns an affluent couple, Agnes and Tobias, who 
find that the delicate balance that they have been able to maintain 
in their lives together is threatened by a triple invasion of their 
tense, but carefully balanced household.
Two of the intruders are a neighboring couple, Harry and 
Edna, their best friends for 40 years have come to ask hospital
ity indefinitely, because they have been seized with an indefinable 
anxiety, which Albee implies is due to sudden realization of empti
ness in their lives.
The third intruder is the daughter, Julia, who has returned 
home after her fourth marriage fails. She brings with her hysteria 
and anxiety, too.
Another part of this apple-cart is the sister, Claire, who is an 
enjoyable sharp-witted alcoholic.
Teamed up in the starring roles are Scottie McGregor and 
James Noble, the same couple that shared the spotlight in the Play 
house production of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? two seasons 
ago.

Volumeu67 dnls Nbr7 11) 
congress that it is meant to 
preclude egg-throwing, rock 
hurling, or tumult designed to 
drown out that the speaker is 
saying.
Student role in running the 
universityThis is very vague, 
stating only that the students 
role should be clearly defined. 
It is probably the most mini
mal section of the document.
Student PressThe statement 
encourages financially indepen
dent campus newspapers and 
calls for editorial freedom and 
due process in firing edtors. 
But it also offers two escape 
caluses. One says that the uni
versity may have to bear legal 
responsibility for a student 
publication when it is not finan
cially autonomous. The other 
says freedom entails corallary 
responsibilities to be governed 
by the canons of responsible 
journalism, such as the avoid
ance of libel, indecency, undocu
mented allegations, attacks on 
personal integrity, and tech
niques of harassment and innu
endo. While not objectionable 
in themselves, interpretation of 
canons of responsible journal
ism have been used by many 
college presidents to justify cen
sorship of student publications.
Freedom off-campusThough 
it says universities should pro
vide information about legal 
rights and counsel to students 
who are arrested, this section 
otherwise follows up strong 
statements of rights with vague 
escape clauses.
It says that students should 
be permitted to exercise the 
rights of citizenship but follows 
that up with as members of 
the academic community, they 
are subject to the obligations 
which accrue to them by virtue 
of this membership. Schwartz 
says the latter statement may 
be used to limit off-campus free
dom.
On the key issue of university 
punishment of law-breaking stu
dentsdouble jeopardy  the 
statement says institutional 
authority should never be used 
merely to duplicate the function 
of general laws, but then of
fers as escape clause: Only 
where the institutions interests 
as an academic community are 
distinct and clearly involved, 
should the special authority of 
the institution be asserted. Ex
actly when that happens is un
clear.
Due process in disciplinary 
proceedingsThis is the longest 
and most explicit section of the 
statement. It guarantees many 
student rights including: the 
right to have a statement of the 
charges against him, the oppor
tunity for refutation of the 
cahrges, orderly deliberation of 
those charges, and the right to 
appeal. Also included are stu
dent participation in formulating 
rules, the right of a student not 
to have his rooms searched by 
university officials without his 
consent (although theer is an 
escape clause: under extreme 
emergency circumstances), and 
the right of students to remain 
in school while they await dis
ciplinary action.
But this section also has its 
vague escape clause: educa
tional institutions have a duty 
and corollary disciplinary pow
ers to protect their educational 
purpose through the setting of 
standards of scholarship and con
duct . . . . Even Schwartz, gen
erally a strong proponent of the 
statement, calls this section ob
jectionable and adds, the eduGENERAL

STUDY ABROAD
MSUStudents from across the U.S. are enrolling now in the 
new courses offered in Europe this summer by the American Lan
guage and Educational Center (AMLEC) of Michigan State Uni
versity. The courses, taught by MSU professors-in-residence and 
supplemented by experts in the home countries, provide a new ap
proach in these subject-matter fields. MSU credit is given for the 
successful completion of the summers work. Enrollment deadline 
for these courses has been extended to March 11. Credit and non
credit language programs in Europe are also open to qualified stu-| 
dents in the AMLEC program, with the deadline set at May 1. In
terested students can obtain more information by contacting the 
AMLEC office, 107 Center for International Programs, Michigan State 
University, East Lansing, Michigan 48823, Telephone 517/353-8921.
Come Back Baby
The film Come Back Baby
that was made here last year 
by David Greene and Terry 
Riebling has been accepted 
for distribution by the Film 
Makers Co-Op in New York. 
Mr. Greene and Mr. Riebling,
cational mission of institutions 
has been used to justify too 
many idiotic rules to mention 
here.
Despite all these weaknesses, 
Schwartz views the statement 
as a significant step forward, 
considering the groups in
volved. That is probably true. 
But, given these weaknes es, en
forcement and interpretation be
come especially important, and 
students will have to be watchfull to see that the document 
is not used to excuse violations 
of the freedoms it is intended 
to insure.
It is hoped that on those cam
puses where students want to 
see the Joint Statement adopt
ed, they will emphasize that, 
since it includes only minimal 
student rights, that the college 
should adopt it in full and per
haps do a little more.
Dean Brown has recently is
sued his draft of the academic 
freedoms for C-MU students 
and faculty printed in the Feb.
7 Tartan. He hopes that through 
student and faculty support, it 
will become a reality.
