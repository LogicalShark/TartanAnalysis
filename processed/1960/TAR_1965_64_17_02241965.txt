Tartan Takes Poll Stever To Consider Changes
On Deferred Rush
Actives Opinions Rushees9 Opinions
by Bruce Getin
This years second semes
ter fraternity rush has evoked 
a great amount of comment 
and controversy over the rel
ative merits of immediate 
rush and deferred rush for 
freshman.
Both systems are appealing 
^from various positions and both 
have disadvantages, as voiced by 
fraternity men on the Carnegie 
Tech campus.
Before the duplexes on Forbes 
Avenue were built, rush was the 
reverse of the present system: the 
students rushed the fraternities, 
which were located off campus.
When the fraternities moved on 
campus with administration finan| cial support, rush was regularly 
second semester. Then, in 1961, 
the fraternity system requested an 
immediate rush. It was granted on 
a trial basis for the 1962-63 and 
1963-64 school years, with the 
provision that deferred rush 
would prevail thereafter.
The two years of September 
rush were granted to save houses 
from financial difficulty. It was 
felt that immediate rush would 
It bring freshmen into the system 
much sooner.
This argument, it seems, must 
be granted because this past se
mester saw all houses on campus 
undergo some financial problems. 
But in most cases it is expected 
that the results of second semester 
rush will alleviate these problems.
It is also argued that first se. mester rush allows more fresh(C-men to enter the system. This 
argument loses its validity when 
it is noted that last year only 60% 
of the first semester pledges were 
initiated.
At this point, the arguments for 
late rush take over.
In general, the advantages of 
the deferred rush deal more with 
matters which could have a longM range effect on the fraternity sys$ tem.
Proponents of deferred rush 
claim that it permits, the rushees 
to learn more about the fraterni
ties, and vice-versa. Thus, when 
pledging arrives the xushees are 
more likely to choose a house 
which best suits them. And the 
fraternity men can choose fresh
men whom they believe best for 
their houses. It is suggested that if 
\ such harmony is achieved, more 
pledges will be initiated, fewer of 
whom will go inactive later.
Also, men with very low factors 
are elimianted from second se
mester rush.
Many fraternity men feel that 
the optimum situation would be 
achieved by a compromise rush, 
with pledging around Thanksgiv
ing. This supposedly combines the 
J better points of both kinds of rush.
However, it is still too early to 
make conclusions about the effectivity of this years deferred rush.
It will be at least a semester be
fore the percentage of initiates is 
known. And it may be several 
years before any definite state
ment can be made concerning the 
effect of deferred rush on strength 
of the fraternity system.

Mag Wants
The question, Do you ap
prove of second semester fra
ternity rush? has generally 
been answered with a yes 
by freshmen.
A majority of those freshmen 
interviewed agreed that delayed 
rush allowed them time to adjust 
to college life. They thought that 
pledging first semester would have 
hurt their grades. Such replies as
You have enough to cope with 
without first semester rush to 
worry about. Youre studying 
and not partying,  were com
mon.
Many freshmen were of the op
inion that delayed rush gave them 
a much better opportunity to find 
the right fraternity. It gave them 
time to visit several houses and 
find the one that suited them best. 
Living in the dorms first semester 
also presented them with a picture 
of independent life.
Several freshmen criticized the 
brevity of formal rush. They 
thought that it should last for at 
least two weeks. Others felt that 
formal rush did not allow them to 
view what normal fraternity life 
was like.
Of the few freshmen who would 
have rather pledged during the 
first semester, some believed that 
joining a fraternity in September 
would have given them a sense of 
belonging to offset the feeling of 
loneliness brought in by living 
away from home.
Others argued that immediate 
rush would have helped them ad
just more rapidly in their pur
suits.
One statement seems to best 
summarize the freshman opinion 
about this years deferred rush. 
It gave me time to decide wheth
er I really wanted fraternity 
life.

According to George K. Brown, 
Dean of Student Affairs, such a 
proposal had been in the minds 
of the Student Affairs Division 
for 2 or 3 years.
Almost 90% of the girls would 
be living with other girls and

believe that a thorough grounding in many phases 
of our business is one of the best ways to cultivate 
management talent. An example: Bob Anderson 
of our finance staff.
Since Bob came to us in July, 1963, hes been, 
actively involved in five important areas of the Company. As a member 
of our finance staff, he has reviewed budget and cost programs of a division, 
marketing cars, another manufacturing tractors and subsidiaries engaged 
in automobile financing and insurance. In addition, Bob was selected to 
assist in the 1964 national labor-management negotiations. His present 
assignment is as a staff budget analyst for product engineering and styling.' 
Because of experiences like these, Bob will be able to channel his career 
toward the activity that interests him most.
As a large automobile concern, Ford Motor Company needs people who 
can handle a wide variety of assignments. Our college graduates come to 
us with all types of educational backgrounds. And many of them move 
into management positions unrelated to their degrees. If a fast-moving

Editorial
Culture Ignored
Cultural activities offered on the Carnegie Tech cam
pus hold a prominent position in the college community 
because of their quality, quantity, and diversity. Yet, we, 
the Carnegie Tech students, often do not attend such events.
When a few spare moments appear, we are likely to 
say, Wish something was happening tonight. We bemoan 
the fact that there are so many cultural events off cam
pus, but few lack the necessary transportation and/or funds 
to enjoy them. We wish more such activities were avail
able on campus.
How can we be so oblivious to all that Carnegie Tech 
offers? Not only are there classrooms, books, and blue books, 
but there is also a multitude of cultural events.
We need not even venture off the Carnegie Tech cam
pus to attend a play, hear a concert, or walk through an 
art gallery.
On our way from class, or during a study break from 
the library, we can see art exhibits in either the Porter 
Garnett Gallery on the third floor of Baker Hall or the 
Hewlett Gallery in the Fine Arts building. For a longer 
trip, there is the Carnegie Museum of Art on Forbes Avenue.
As far as music, we have student recitals, faculty re
citals and concerts, the Cameron choir, and the Kiltie Band. 
None of these ever have the audience they deserve. Off 
campus, but still within a short distance, we can hear the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra or the Carnegie Concert 
Series.
Carnegie Tech is widely known for several of its lec
ture series. Two of these which draw audiences from all 
over Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas are the Ben
jamin Fairless and Maurice Falk lecture series. Rarely is 
the student attendance even noticeable. Also the assembly 
committee provides as speakers such noted persons as Genevive Blatt or Drew Pearson. The English department of
fers us an excellent series on famous authors, poets, and 
playwrights.
Plays produced by the drama department are well re
ceived by many students, but some have been here four 
years and are not really sure where the Fine Arts Theater is.
Film Arts on Thursday nights, Film Graphics on the 
first Tuesday of each month, and the Friday Cine Series, 
presented by the YM-YWCA are available to any person 
within the college community.
Most of these activities are offered either free or at 
very low cost to us as students. All that remains is that 
we take advantage of the opportunities that may never 
again be so plentiful with so little effort on our part.
It is up to us to realize the full benefit of college life, 
by taking full advantage of the cultural opportunities 
on campus.

Students Seen To Lack 
Respect For Teachers
Editor, the Tartan:
Lately, around the campus, Ive 
been hearing about the imperson
alness, the indifferences of the 
teachers. Since I heard it, Ive 
been observing how the students 
treat the teachers.
Very few teachers are given 
the respect they certainly de
serve.
In my chem lecture, everyone 
begins talking and preparing to 
leave the moment the bell rings, 
completely missing the final 
words, oftentimes the core, of the 
lecture. Some students do not read 
their assignments and dismiss the 
lecture as incoherent and boring.
These are the very ones who 
say the course is not good, nor 
is the lecturer. These are the ones 
who dont ask for help and get 
low marks, then blame it on the 
lack of interest of the teacher. 
Maybe, Im a kook, but last semes
ter for a long time I was one of 
these people.
Then I began to do my part. I 
now have a very good chem course 
and an interested teacher. I wish 
people would look to themselves 
before they shove all the blame 
where it does not belong.

apparent that President Johnson 
realizes the existing problems as 
evidenced by his recent request to

however, that he doesnt know

Text Of President Stever's First Speech Before Student Body
President Stever Greets Students; Defines Goals
Members of the student body of Carnegie Tech. About 
two months ago I had the pleasure of speaking to you in 
the student assembly on the occasion when Dr. J. C. Warner, then President, and I am hap-^------------------------------:

ident Emeritus of Carnegie Tech,; the modern college student, one 
gave his last talk to you. I on the modern college professor,
From that talk, I learned a lot and one on the modern college 
about Carnegie Tech: its history, i president. Let me say another reaancl alcohol, and sorority floors at 
Morewood Gardens.
Beer and Alcohol 
When I saw that one about beer 
and alcohol, the only thing I could 
| say was one of my good friends 
 said, that he believes that theIonly invention that mankind has
come up with that is better than
the wheel, is that of brewing beer year or two ago giving a Phi Beta
and making cheese.
And I-so-ah. I guess the only 
thine I will say on policy re
garding; beer and alcohol is that 
generally I am for brewing beer 
and making cheese. I think that 
was sufficiently unclear to ev
erybody so  I noticed Dean 
Brown's fingers crossed just like 
that when I said that.
Kappa lecture at my alma mater, 
Colgate, in which  well the 
topic was The Place of the Lib
eral Arts College in a World of 
Science. And if you think in this 
special university for liberal-pro
fessional education that we have 
educational problems, theyre not 
as great as those faced by the lib
eral arts colleges which are being

There are also some problems squeezed by better education at 
that you have talked about that hi8h schot)1 and community colare more general such as the at- on one end and by gra uate
titude of the new administration schools in the great universities 
toward Student Government, pol- on the other, 
icy regarding student responsibil
ity, the importance it will place on 
fraternities and sororities, on the 
one hand, and the independent 
student on the other, as well as
In preparation for that lecture, 
I read an article describing the 
goals of education as seen by a 
number of leading educators, in 
fact presidents of some of the
its concern for the future of foot- great colleges and universities of
ball and athletics.
Some remaining topics of inter
est to the students are amongst 
the broadest problems of educa
tion facing Carnegie Tech and in
deed facing all universities and 
colleges in the country; such as 
relative emphasis on graduate
the country. The goals could be 
gathered under three different 
heads.
States Goals
Of course you must realize that 
every educator, though he says 
precisely what the one who spoke 
before him says, he puts it in difversus undergraduate academic ferent language so I had to reduce 
programs; will the new president quite a bit of writing before I disconcentrate on students or get
ting money for the school?
All of these have been brought 
up by some of you students, and 
I cannot say how pleased to learn 
of the breadth of your interests 
and depth of your questions.
Im sure you will understand 
my not giving my opinion on all 
of them today. I havent had time
covered that there were three 
goals in the report that I am re
ferring to. But in any case there 
were three essential goals.
One of them was the liberal, 
broad education which has to 
do with the world around us 
and mans position in it.
This obviously is extremely 
broad. It covers history not only
enough and you know it. Most of peoples but of nations and it 
importantly, I think, is there has also covers the works of individ: not been time for the concerted ual men in science, business, creagroup action of president- admini- tive and performing arts, politics, 
j stration - trustees - faculty - stu- religion, every field of human enj dents - alumni and everyone con- deavor.
cerned with Carnegie Tech to look 
at the problems and come up with 
any solutions.
Defines Purpose of Education
It considers the lessons man has 
learned in the past and also the 
broad sweep of mankind individ
ually and with respect to societys
President Stever At The Rostrum
Before I address myself to some development. It also involves the 
of these topics, and I am going present world with the objective 
to pick a few to address, let me of pointing out and helping stugive a few thoughts on the broad dent get some idea of the large
purposes of education. I recall a(continued on page 6)
its growth, its aspirations, and its 
character: some of the problems 
that had confronted Dr. Warner, 
and fortunately he listed a few 
that would confront me.
Today, as I promised then, I am 
meeting you again. And at that 
time I claimed I would have 
something more substantive to 
say. I must say now 1 am a little 
sorry I made the promise because 
I discover there is an awful lot 
and I have had only 16 days to 
learn it.
Some of you may also have seen 
in recent Pittsburgh papers pic
tures of me, your new President, 
all wreathed in smiles and ap
parently happy and already en
joying the job after only two 
weeks. The smiles are left over 
from the days of courtship when I 
was talking with trustees, ad
ministration, and deans about the 
possibility of coming to Carnegie 
Tech.
I must say looking back I am 
reminded of a recruiting officer 
who dazzles the prospective ser
vice man with stirring tales of 
foreign travel, educational oppor
tunities, opportunities to build his 
own career, healthful out-of-door 
living, and the added sex appeal 
of the swashbuckling adventurer, 
also capped by a tax-free supply 
of ber at the Post Exchange. No 
word about reville, of 20-mile 
hikes, of kitchen duty, or obstacle 
coureses.
Having signed up for and openended hitch at Carnegie Tech, I 
find reville blows early and taps 
late, and I am amazaed that at 
this, that was 2 months ago in 
conversations, a problem-free in
stitution.
I am amazed so many prob
lems could be developed in 16 
days.
If the trustees were only recruting for Uncle Sam, none of 
you would have to worry about 
the draft.
Many of you read recently in 
Life magazine three articles which
son that Ive been smiling recent
ly is that I know that all of us 
are in the same boat, none of us 
have the time to do the work we 
would like to do, all of us are over
worked.
Defines Attitudes
More seriously though, my at
titudes toward this new job is 
best expressed in the words of 1 
one of my old friends. Early last 
fall when I was considering com
ing here as president, Jimmy Doo
little, business man. engineer, 
pilot, and war leader, with whom 
I have been associated for many 
years, told me, Guy, there is no 
job more important job today than 
the education of our young peo
ple.
You know there is no educa
tional institution in the coutnry 
that doesnt have some very seri- j 
ous problems. I have just left one. j 
My wife and I get alumni com- j 
munications and requests for sup- j 
port to solve problems from 9 dif- : 
ferent educational institutions. I 
have just left one, as I say, I am 
trustee at another and I know that 
all of them have problems.
Carnegie Tech has its share, but j 
no more than its share, and, in | 
fact, looking over the educational \ 
situation in the country, were j 
much better off than most colleges. | 
I have learned a lot about prob
lems here. I started out by learn
ing them from the trustees and the 
| administration and the faculty. 
Those are people of my age and 
people with whom it is very easy 
for me to communicate. I see them 
all the time and it is only natural 
I learn their problems first.
However, I have also had some 
inputs from students.
Dean Brown collected a list 
of topics on which youre interested and automatically 
which become of interest to me. 
He gave me a list of 14 and 
some things are such as intra
mural field lights and the intraI mural program and the future of 
I football, the policy regarding beerStudents Show Appreciation For Dr. Stever's Humor.

issue that are facing man at this 
particular time.
The second major goal of edu
cation is in the development 
and knowledge of skills and 
even creative abilities to enable 
Hne to earn a living, to enable 
one to contribute his bit to so
ciety as an individual, an en
gineer. a housewife, an artist, 
a poet, a business leader, a doc
tor. in any profession, or any 
job.
The third goal of education is 
somewhat-different, it's the devel-[ 
opment of the individual, helping ; 
the student to learn about himself, 
his strengths, and his limitations: 
where he fit in the world, to esta
blish the proper balance amongst 
his ideals and his activities, and 
to discover any latent talents.
All of you are faced with the \ 
problem of the relative importance j 
of these three goals, three differ
ent goals of education: how should I 
you divide your time amongst j 
them? You wonder whether its j 
best to concentrate narrowly in a 
professional specialty or to devel
op very broadly in education. 
Some of you even wonder whether 
you want to become a professional 
at all.
Most of you wonder how to 
chos between concentration on 
your studies and on the develop
ment of yourselves in other direc
tions, in a social direction  to 
appreciate a cultural life, to devel
op your physical well-being in 
athletics, either organized, unor
ganized. or disorganized. Some of 
you wonder how much time you 
should s-H nd on self generated ac
tivities. in student publications, 
which are time consuming, but 
with satisfactions and end pro
ducts which you can call your 
own.
Some of you wonder how much 
time you can use purely in escape 
recreation  reading a murder 
mystery, or going to a movie  
of course I know that theres only 
one murder mystery, one movie ; 
now and thats a James Bond one. | 
So there isn't much choice there, j
Some of you even wonder how 
much time you ean allocate to j 
falling in love. But again that s 
not in the written version here 
and it's only one of the many ) 
things involved in attaining the ; 
third goal of < dueation.
You know, if you think of these j 
three goals of education, youll 
discover that Carnegie Tech takes 
direct responsibility in two of 
them, i ot only in providing you 
as good an education as possible 
within the limits of its resources, 
but it insists on measuring your 
progress toward those goals.
Those, of course, relate to 1he 
liberal  general education in
volved in your undergraduate 
years and to your professional de
velopment. That's both in the* un
dergraduate and graduate years.
But for the third goal of edu
cation Carnegie Tech and most 
other universities and colleges 
does not take responsibility for 
your participation or even meas
ure your performance.
I say that tiid actually of \ 
course all of you really know that j 
your performance is recorded and 
appreciated even though it isn't j 
measured in the normal sense, j 
Your participation and your work j 
toward the third goal is essentially ; 
your own responsibility, yet all of 1 
us believe that it's an important i 
aspect of your education.
We try to furnish you living ar
rangements, such that you can de
velop yourself socially with other 
students and, hopefully, occasion- j 
ally, with some members of the j

faculty if you choose. We try to 
provide you with facilities for rec
reation and sports that you can 
use as you see fit. And we try to 
support student activities in which 
you can develop all sorts of tal
ents, and hopefully, also have lots 
M of fun. We do, and here we do 
exceptionally well, provide you 
with an opportunity to expose 
yourself to the broadest cultural 
interests.
See Editorial, Page 4
I hope furthermore that we can 
work with you to help you achieve 
. this third goal of education even 
though I realize we must never 
usurp your freedom of choice in 
that area.
Balancing Time 
Its a tough decision to make 
" to balance your time, Youre often 
told that the most important thing 
you have to learn is to say no. 
" I dont believe that at all.
The most important thing' you 
have to learn is ti say yes to 
the right things.
I know a story about a foot
ball coach, by the way, who had 
one of his players cone up to him 
who was troubled with this whole 
business of getting on in college 
dividing his time, and he said, 
Coach, Im in trouble. I just got 
my report card and with football 
and everything, I- got 3 Fs and 1 
D. What should I do?- And the 
coach thought, and thought, and i 
thought, . and he said: Son, the 
only thing I can say is possibly 
youre spending.too much time on 
one of those subjects.
In my time in the educational , 
world Ive noticed that the bal
ance among the facilities -toward 
this are used for this third s^oal 
of education have changed with 
time. And the balance among 
these activities at any given place 
is quite different at a given time. 
For example for Carnegie Tech, 
located here in Pittsburgh, it is 
quite different than for a small 
liberal arts college in some re! mote location..
Carnegie Tech Is Cnique 
It is different from that rei quired at the large general pur
pose universities; its uniquely dif
ferent here at Carnegie Tech from 
all other institutes of technology. 
We have to seek the right balance
in these facilities and support we 
give you for development toward 
this third goal of education.
We can do this only by esta
blishing and maintaining goodlines of communication, good rap
port with the student body as a 
whole, the student body divided 
into groups, and as individuals.
I told the faculty the other day 
in my talk to them, that there" 
was in old Spanish proverb that 
applied to the matter of commu
nication. The proverb is take 
what you want and pay for it. 
If we are to have good commu
nications, we. must pay for it in 
spending time on it.
In addition to the problems for 
balancing the facilities provided 
lor you, I have already pointed 
1 out, that you each have the probj lem to achieve the right balance 
lor yourself. And here I hope you 
act as individuals because none of 
you can or should have the same 
balance. Some of you will prefer 
professional studies, broad liberal 
' < ducation. and some will partiI cipate in student affairs, athletics, 
development of your cultural and 
. social tastes.
But the important thing here is 
not that you turn out to be like 
;.nvbody elje or that there is any
ideal, any pei'fect path on that 
third goal. The important thing is 
that you have tried enough, and 
you have participated enough, so 
that you will be able to determine 
the best balance for you as an in
dividual; so you can baximize 
your contribution to society, anti 
also this is very important, max
imize your enjoyment and satis
factions in life, and especially op
timize that particular portion of 
your education that you get at 
Carnegie Tech.
I like Carnegie Tech, though I 
have only been here for two 
Weeks. I hope it isnt as exciting 
as this all the time, I couldnt 
lake it. There are some features 
of our program, I have discover
ed, that are excellent, can not be 
beaten at any school in the world. 
Much of our education and our 
educational facilities is good  it 
stands up well with most in the 
world and all of our education has 
a chance of becoming even better.
There are some elements, of 
course, in reasonable number, 
and that saves the day tor us, 
that needs substantial improve
ment.
Im sure we are going to have 
opportunity as time goes by to 
select new, developing fields in
liberal-professional education to 
add to our current program and 
to enrich Carnegie Tech educa
tion.
Nature Of Carnegie Tech
Ncw let me turn away a little 
from the goals of education and 
talk a little bit about the na
ture of this university relative to 
others. I know from my brief ex
perience with Carnegie Tech peo
ple that they don't quite know 
how to describe their own institu
tion. It is, though its small and 
specialized, it is in its approach 
to education, a university. Its * 
multipurpose university and i 
used that description to the fac
ulty the other day, and let me use 
it to you and describe what I 
mean.
Faculty Services
Our faculty performs four ser
vices  one is the general educa! tion of undergraduates, profes1 sional education, either at the un
dergraduate or graduate level.
W3 also try to increase mans 
storehouse of knowledge about the 
physical world, the world of huI man beings and create works of 
scholarships and art, and finally 
we serve the community. In some 
cases, the service to the commu(continued- on page 8)

nity is quite local, it may be with
in the university itself.
A professor in one area giving 
a seminar series in an entirely 
different area, or professors in the 
fine arts presenting plays and mu
sical programs to those students 
who are not in it. So service 
to the community, the univer
sity is one form of this. But 
it may also be to the city, it 
may be to its industry or its ed
ucation. And I think many of you 
know Carnegie Techs contribu
tion there. I have had leading edu
cators before I came here say that 
Carnegie Tech has ddne more for 
secondary education than any col
lege in the country. That service 
can also be service to the state or 
national government and today 
with modern communication it can 
be service to the international 
world as well.
These four are the multipur
poses of this university. We have 
to balance our interests in all 
those to insure that both our un
dergraduate and graduate students 
get first class education.
But we must not fail to also 
serve the fields of scholarship 
and serve the communities in 
which we live.
Both of these latter, by the way, 
we believe, strengthen our faculty 
and the institution and make it 
more capable of doing those first 
two. the direct educational jobs.
We get funds from three dif
ferent sources  student fees, 
large government grants for re
search. and also from private 
philanthropy. We do not try to 
account for each penny for each 
service. We believe that the ser
vices are so inter-related we can
not separate them and our prob
lem is seeking balance.
The other day I had a letter 
from one of you students, a very 
thoughtful letter, that expressed 
concern that emphasis on research 
and graduate work might weaken 
and hold back the further im- j 
provement of our undergraduate 
teaching.
Last Tuesday, when I talked to 
the meeting of the faculty, I made 
a point that there are some 
thoughtful educators in this coun
try today that believe that under
graduate education is being short 
changed in many of our colleges 
and universities. I also pointed 
out that, as I have just done here, 
that Carnegie Tech is a multipur
pose university and our problem 
is to seek balance.
We can do nothing less than 
seek balance, and on the other 
hand we must make doubly sure 
that we know whether we can 
be accused as others have been 
of neglecting our undergraduate 
teaching. I am sure we are go
ing to make an examination of 
this and if it is out of balance 
it will be corrected.
But I also want you to know 
that it is only one part of our 
work to be balanced and in fact, 
in the long run, our undergradu
ate education would be nowhere 
near as lively and nowhere worth 
as much to you if we didn't en
gage and engage well in those 
other functions too.
Interest In Students 
Another question I received 
was: Is the new president going 
to be more interested in students 
or in raising money? And our 
chairman today has done a beau
tiful job of pointing out the prob
lems of a college president. The 
two features are inseperable.
However, I honestly consider 
my first responsibility to focus 
the educational developments 
at Carnegie Tech, to help the 
faculty achieve its maximum 
potential in this area, and als* 
to help you students get the 
most out of your education.
Of course, it is an inseperable 
responsibility to insure all of this 
is supported properly. And I am 
sure I will also have other .du
ties in the community and the na
tion. I find myself already, along 
with other administrators and 
faculty members here, and alumni 
and trustees and everyone, carry
ing throughout the land the Car
negie Tech flag. And, I may say, 
I do it proudly.
Focus Of Attention
Another general question asked 
by the studentsWill the new
presidents interest focus on the 
schools of Engineering and Sci
ence, on Business Management? 
Will be neglect the College of Fine 
Arts and Margaret Morrison Col
lege for Women? My answer to 
this is as follows:
Carnegie Tech has a unique 
character. I think its character 
has more interesting facets than 
many other schools that I know. 
By that, I do not mean were big
ger or better known or better sup
ported. But the balance between 
these schools: engineering and
science, business management, fine 
arts, liberal arts, and certain spe
cial education for women is a 
good and it is an interesting one.
I have spent most of my adult 
life at two other institutes of tech
nologyCal Tech and MIT. I en
joyed both of them, and wouldnt 
swap educational experience there 
for anything, but I do not con
sider my job is to build Carnegie 
Tech in the image of them or of 
any other school I know. I think 
that job is to help make Car
negie Tech a better Carnegie Tech.
And that means supporting 
the College of Fine Arts and 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College for Women as well as 
the College of Engineering and
Science the Division of Human
ities and Social Studies, and the 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration.
With respect to undergraduate 
student activities, athletics, and 
other recreational affairs, my in
terest here is to insure that we 
have facilities and help for the 
students to do those things they 
consider important. I want to 
encourage them to participate as I 
said earlier for it will help to de
velop them as individuals.
Here is where you do the de
ciding. I would point out again 
that the balance of the facilities 
and our interest must be deter
mined uniquely for Carnegie Tech. 
We are different from all other 
schools, and we must work on that 
assiduously. I would say this, 
that I am often asked particular
ly about the kind of athletic pro
gram that should be developed 
over the long run. I dont know. 
Frankly, I havent been here long 
enough to know but I am en
thusiastic in finding out what the 
right job is to do and to do it 
well.
Student Activities
Student activities and social life 
have changed over the years. I 
remember the time when practi
cally all the focus was on stu
dent activities, then students be
gan to do more in their social life. 
Then there came a time when stu
dents seemefi to prefer to sit 
around and listen to the Kingston 
Trio. You see I am dated. Or 
Joan Baez.
I thought that dated me too, 
until I saw that she played re
cently for a group of students who 
were conducting interesting affairs 
at the University of California.
There has been a steady de
velopment, I think this is one of 
the proudest things that has hap
pened to American education, one 
of the finest things.
Theres been an increased 
consciousness and interest of 
students in the affairs of the 
world around them. Civil rights, 
the development of cities, the 
establishment of national goals 
and policies, the development 
of education.
There has been growing inter
est of students to participate in 
service work in their community, 
I hope that this university can 
be sufficiently flexible in its pro
grams so that we can help the 
students develop in their interests 
j as they change from time to time.
To Solve The Problems 
I am not going to address par
ticular items. I only promise you 
that part of my time and the ad
ministrations will be used in try
ing to solve them. There are no 
pat answers to any of these 
problems in education at the 
present time. At least I dont 
have them and I am always sus
picious of someone who claims he 
does.
We have to work together to 
improve the university so that for 
two purposes, one so that you will 
get the most out of it while you 
are here, and those who follow 
you will get an even better edu
cation.
Most of my colleagues in the*, 
country in the educational fielcK 
think this is going to be one of 
its most exciting- times in history 
and Im delighted to be spending 
my time on such educational de
velopments at Carnegie Tech,
Well educated professionals are 
badly needed in the world today. 
Mans biggest problem is to avoid 
a nuclear war, without violating, 
by the way, his better principles.
If he succeeds in that, and I anu( 
reasonably confident that he will, 
he can then tackle some longsought-for objectives; freeing all 
men from want so they can con
tribute their share to the worlds 
works, and share its reward.
More specifically, in this coun
try we can rebuild our cities, re
duce prejudice, spread cultural 
opportunties, improve education. 
Not one of the professions, yours or 
mine, has the key to mans prob
lems, yet none of those problems^!) 
can be solved without each and 
every profession.
May we wish you well in the 
pursuit of all the goals of educaThey go to the same school, take the 
same course, start out in the same job 
yet one becomes a whiz in research and 
the other a sales manager in Buffalo.
We think its wonderful. As a matter 
of fact, thats exactly the way things 
happen at Lukens.
We dont try to put people in pigeon
holes. We cant. There are no two alike.
We find that good engineers often 
make excellent salesmen .., and that 
some good salesmen do even better as 
steel plant managers.
Our director of purchases started
with the field sales force. Our manager 
of market development was a design 
engineer. Our president... a person
nel man.
This flexible shifting of people, and 
their infinite variety of skills, has made 
Lukens a $100-million-plus corporation 
... the 4th largest steel plate producer 
in the nation .,. the worlds leading pro
ducer of specialty plate steels.
If you dislike being pigeon-holed, 
perhaps youd like to consider a career 
with us. You can never tell where it 
might lead.

Young men of ability can get to the top fast at 
Boeing. Today, Boeings business backlog is 
just under two billion dollars, of which some
 60 per cent is in commercial jetliner and heli
copter product areas. The remainder is in mili

contracts. This gives the company one of the 
most stable and diversified business bases in 
the aerospace industry.
No matter where your career interests lie  
in the commercial jet airliners of the future 
or in space-flight technology  you can find 
an opening of genuine opportunity at Boeing. 
The company's world leadership in the jet 
transport field is an indication of the calibre 
of people youd work with at Boeing.
Boeing is now pioneering evolutionary ad

Finance Comm 
Sets Plans For 
New Projects
The Finance Committee of 
Student Congress has de
fined its plans for a modified 
financial system.
According to the committee 
chairman, Aronovitz, the plans 
are designed to provide increased 
services to Carnegie Tech Stu
dents at lower costs, and to rem
edy -poor proceedures discovered 
during preparation of the 1965-66 
budget, which is still under con
sideration by the Administration.
While preparing preliminary 
financial reports essential to the 
1965-66 budget, the finance com
mittee was hampered by the lack 
of standardized forms and pro
ceedures. The financial informa
tion reporting forms and proced
ures subcommittee, under the di
rection of Bill Anderson, 205 Donner Hall, will seek ways to pre
vent such difficulties for future 
finance committees. Those stu
dents interested in organization 
and information processing should 
contact Anderson at 682-9252.
The revenue and economics sub
committee is concerned with pro
moting new ways to finance stu
dent Government projects such as 
Spring Carnival, Fall Festival, the 
activities and the publications. 
The committee will look into the 
possibilities of vending machines, 
to be installed in the academic 
building, and the complete reno
vation of the present snack bar. 
Bob Blasier is the chairman of 
this committee. He can be con
tacted at 682-9053.
The chairman has not yet been 
appointed for the publications, 
finances and general accounting 
committee. Interested students 
should contact Aronovit at 421- 
0514.
The special financial affairs sub
committee will deal with emer
gency aid and scholarship pro
grams and such issues as arise 
or are sought out by its chairman. 
The chairmanship is open to a 
junior or senior of high academic 
standing. Scholarship holders are 
eligible but past holders of aid are 
not. Applications and addition
al details may be obtained from 
Aronovitz, chairman of the finance 
committee, at 421-0514.

Steel Firm Seeks Grads
The Armco Steel Corporation of 
Middletown, Ohio is seeking a re
cord number of graduates for em
ployment. Candidates from CarAs the I.M. basketball season nears the halfway point, 
GSIA, BTP, and ATO loom as the top contenders in a field 
of more than thirty teams. The Grads have yet to open 
the defense of their school cham-OAnpionship, but both the Betas and 
ATO saw action last week, and if 
they can both keep up their rec
ord point production, this years 
playoffs could contain some fast 
and exciting action.
The Betas whipped the Good 
Guys by a 89-24 score, as eight 
men hit the scoring column. Dale 
Johnson led the balanced attack 
with 31 points while Sam Cupps 
added 16. Although it doesnt 
show in the scoring column, the 
well-executed full-court press, 
which the Betas utilized, put the 
game well out of reach in the first 
quarter. In other action in the 
KNICKS LEAGUE, GSIA B 
nipped ATO B, 23-17, despite an 
outstanding defensive perform
ance by ATOs Slick Connors.
Alpha Tau Omega ripped the 
cords for one less than the cen
tury mark in rolling over the 
Dunkers, 99-26. ATO built up a 
53-6 lead at the half, and coasted 
in from there. Frank Oliver, with 
29 points, and Bill Schliep, with
choice in the PISTONS LEAGUE. 
The <->ther league game found BSR 
defeating PKA B, 42-18.
The Civil Hammers still seem 
the logical choice in the HAWKS 
LEAGUE, despite a narrow 54-49 
win over Delta Tau Delta. Their 
one-two scoring punch of Mel 
Ramey and Nick Carter proved to 
be the difference, as Ramey hit for 
18 points, and Carter 17. In the 
same league, the Foul-Outs took 
the Iron Men for a 33-24 score.
The Grad Thors, seeded first in 
the LAKERS LEAGUE, ran true 
to form by defeating BTP B 29- 
19, while the Frosh pulled away in 
the last half to whip the Fire 
Plugs, 36-11.
In the ROYALS LEAGUE, Fink 
F went on a scoring splurge to 
down Eigenrac 62-12, as Ken 
Wincko scored 18 points, and Jon 
Rupnik added 12. In other league 
action, the Flat Feet bombed TDP 
B, 51-35.
In the NATIONALS LEAGUE. 
Sigma Nu whipped the Dead Beats 
47-29. as John Blue, Mel Barr, 
and Frank Brady accounted for 
15, 13, and 10 points respec
tively. DU B had a little more 
difficult time of it, as they dropped 
a 39-12 decision to the Grad Lokis.

Judo Team 
Participates 
In Tournament
The Tech Judo Team partici
pated in a three-way tournament 
in Syracuse on Feb. 13, with Syr
acuse Judo Club and Oswego 
State College.
Tartans Rich Colker and Dave 
Saul qualified for the semifinals 
but were eliminated in close 
matches with the more experi
enced Oswego team. Tournament 
Champion was Ron Deline of 
Syracuse Judo Club.
The club will hold a meeting 
tomorrow evening in the Skibo 
Snack Bar. New members are in
vited.
The Womens Athletic Assiciation (W.A.A.) provides 
Carnegie Tech girls with the opportunity to participate in 
intramural and extra sports
Throughout the year the asso
ciation offers coaching and in
struction in tennis, bowling, bad
minton, field hockey, swimming, 
volleyball, riding, fencing, and 
synchronized swimming (the Tarquans). Additional courses, such 
as soccer, dancing, etc. can be re
quested by petition.
Miss Dorothy Kanrich, Miss 
Anna Fisk, and Miss Hirsch coach 
various sports.
According to Miss Kanrich and 
Miss Hirsch, Many girls have the 
false idea that they cannot par
ticipate in a sport if they know 
nothing about it. However, the 
W.A.A. is open to all students re
gardless of experience.
The association is organized in
formally on the basis of clubs. The 
members of each sport elect a 
manager who takes charge of pub
licity and, if it is an extramural 
sport, corresponds with other 
schools.
At the end of the season, an
other election is held and ^ this 
manager becomes a Board mem
ber. The W.A.A. Board consists of 1 
Miss Kenrichsupervisor, Jean 
Melaneypresident, Nancy May
berry  vice-president, Barbara 
Brownsecretary, Barbara Butler 
awards chairman.
An awards system is set up on 
the basis of points. Depending on 
the number of points the partici
pant has accumulated, each mem
ber can receive numerals, letters, , 
or emblems.
There are also trophies for win
ners of meets with other schools. 
The W.A.A. competes with many 
other schools including Chatham,
U of Pitt, Westminster, Indiana, 
Slippery Rock, Geneva, Grove 
City, Seton Hall.
Jean Melaney, president, feels 
that the W.A.A. can be a very 
enjoyable experience for its phy
sical benefits and the relaxation t' 
it provides. Furthermore she 
says, Through its interscholastic 
and intramural program it pro
vides a chance to meet a larger 
variety of girls from dierent de
partments and schools.

Finals To Be

The nice thing about college basketball is that five un
known players from a small, obscure school can knock off 
the big-time athletic powerhouses and win the national 
championship. Possible, but high-4---------------------------------------------------
ly improbable, you say? Of course, 
five unknown players from a 
small, obscure school can be 
knocked off by five even more 
unknown players from a smaller, 
even more obscure school, and 
this could be repeated a number j 
of times throughout the season, j 
Sounds more familiar, eh? Youre 
right . . . its Tech!
In their only action during the 
past week, Tech Tartans dropped 
their twelfth game in sixteen 
starts, losing to the Waynesburg 
Yellow Jackets, 75-70. Tech had 
previously beaten Waynesburg, j 
84-76, at Wayne^Durg, and were 
considered a shoo-in for their 
fifth victory of the season, but, 
with the exception of Jeff Kalin, i 
the Tartans played their worst 
game of the year. Kalin hit for 
35 points, but the rest of the team 
managed only 21% of their shots 
from the field.
Tech jumped into a quick lead 
in the first half, and kept a four
to seven point lead throughout the 
initial stanza, going into the locker 
room with a 40-36 half-time lead. 
Waynesburg opened fast in the 
second half, however, and took a 
42-41 lead with two and a half 
minutes gone. The lead see-sawed 
back and forth until, with 7:45 re
maining, Kalin put Tech ahead, 
59-56.
The next five minutes proved 
disastrous. The Tartans scored 
only one point to Waynesburgs 
sixteen, and with 1:45 left, the 
Yellow-Jackets held a comfort
able 73-60 margin. A late spirt 
by Tech- was to no avail, and the 
Tartans finished on the short 
end of a 75-70 score.
Action this week will be away, 
with Tech going against John Car
roll on Thursday and St. Vincent 
on Saturday. The last two games 
of the season will be against Pitt 
and Fenn, at home, next week.

IM Bowling Semi-finals action 
this week saw ATO versus TDP 
and GSIA B versus GSIA G.
Alpha Tau Omega, behind by 
seventy pins at the end of the 
first game, turned on the steam 
in the second to forge ahead by 
twenty-four pins, and then held 
off a Tau Delt rally to win the 
match by a grand total of six 
pins and earn the right to meet 
GSIA in the finals of IM Bowl
ing next week.
Tau Delta Phi, lead by John 
Piscitelli, rolled a 701 opening 
game, and since ATO could only 
counter with a 631, seemed to 
have the match sewed up from 
the start. However, ATO, with 
Palko, Grieco, Talia, and French 
knocking pins down like they 
were made of rubber instead of 
wood, countered with an amaz
ing 844 second game to take the 
lead even though Tau Delt upped 
their score to 750.
With a 24 pin lead, the third 
game was the deciding one for 
ATO. However, Tau Delt refused 
to give in, and the match was 
decided in the final frame. ATOs 
Francis Hogle doubled for 27 pins, 
and with the pressure on the 
Tau Delts, the final ball rolled, 
left the 1-3 pins remaining on a 
1-3-8 spare, and ATO had won 
the right to meet GSIA in the 
championship match next Satur
day.
Results of the GSIA B, GSIA 
G game are not available.
