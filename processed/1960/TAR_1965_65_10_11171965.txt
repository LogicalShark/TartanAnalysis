Council Proposes 
Open House Policy
A proposal by Mens Dormitory Council that open 
house be held in the mens dorms on alternate Sunday 
afternoons, is now awaiting consideration by the 
Administration.
If the proposal is approved, the men's dorms will 
be open to guests from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on those 
afternoons not taken up by Morewood Gardens open 
house.
Regulations similar to those en
forced during the^big weekends will 
be maintained.
According to Dave Ritchie, pres
ident of Men's Dormitory Council, 
the Council feels that an open house 
would prompt residents to keep the 
dormitory area in a cleaner con
dition. He said, however, that it 
is up to the Administration to make 
the final decision.
Said Marvin Donner, assistant 
dean of men, with regard to the 
Council's proposal: The admin
istration .is not committed to take 
sides until it has a chance to 
review the term open house' and 
to decide whether a change in 
college rules is necessary.* He 
could not be sure when a final 
decision would be reached.
Men's Dormitory Council plans 
to submit a second proposal to 
the Administration regarding 
dormitory lounges. This will 
request that a date lounge be 
furnished Donner Halls.
Donner feels that the Adminis
tration will most probably pass 
this lounge recommendation as 
soon as it is submitted. The pro
posal will involve theConversion of 
Donner - Hall lounge  the pro
vision of a stereo and carpeting 
and the removal of the television 
from that area.

Students Given Last Chance 
To Suggest 1966-67 Calendar
The ad hoc Calendar Committee, created by the Administrative Council last semester, is slated to 
meet on November 30 to consider recommendations on the calendar for the academic year 1966-67. 
At that time, the Calendar Committee of Student Congress would like to represent the wishes of the 
student body by means of a tabulated calendar poll.
Since proposed changes in Carnegie Techs academic calendar were announced to students at the 
beginning of last year, nearly six schedules have been considered by students, faculty and administrators. 
Of these, the tri-mester and term plans were voted unsuitable. They were discarded on the basis of 
impracticality and unfavorable reports from universities at which they have been instituted.
Today two calendars are being
Applications

The Dick Corporation workers 
constructing the new administra
tion building have voiced some 
definite opinions about the ap
pearance of Carnegie Tech stu
dents.
Their biggest complaint con
cerns student dress. It makes 
you wonder about the future of 
the nation, commented one 
worker. Many men described the 
grooming of Carnegie Tech stu
dents - particularly the men - 
as being outlandish.
Nevertheless, to quote one work
er, The kids today are alright; 
I like 'em. Other men suggest
ed that they like to have students 
stopping by the construction site. 
They expressed an admiration of 
Carnegie Tech students and of the 
school as an educational institu
tion. Of their own jobs they said, 
The best thing about construc
tion is Saturday and Sunday. Sur
prising to some students might be

schedule and a calendar formu
lated by the ad hoc calendar com
mittee.
Last year, the University of 
Pennsylvanias *Penn-B* form 
was presented to Student Congress. 
It incorporated a spring recess 
after midsemester and concluded 
its first semester before Christ
mas.
One out of thirty students at 
Carnegie Tech were asked tooffer 
criticism of this plan last Decem
ber. soon after their opinions were 
reviewed, the *Penn-B* calendar 
met opposition from some faculty 
and administrators. As a result of 
this opposition, the Calendar Com
mittee formed an autonomous (ad 
hoc) committee to draft a more 
favorable schedule.
As the situation now stands, the 
calendar drafted by the ad hoc com
mittee is being considered along 
with oui present calendar.
Student Opinion Poll
Included on page 5 of this issue 
of the Tartan are guides tc three 
calendars: the  Penn B,* the pres

ing the three.
Each student is asked to study 
these calendars considering; 
length of vacations, class time, 
period of finals preparation, big 
weekends, spring recess, and holi
days. Preferences in each cat
egory should be indicated by an 
encircled item under one of the 
three calendar headings. (Four

Movie Captures Sensitivity 
In Sicilian Family Life
ky CeiOy hSBi
Director Pietro Germi and producer Carlo Ponti 
have combined their prolific artistry in The Rail
road Man, a motion picture capturing the sensitivity 
of and social constrictions placed upon the lower 
Sicilian classes.
It is apparent that the European 
motion picture industry is master
ful in producing the desired effect 
of its efforts. In The Railroad 
Man,* off-used theme of the trials 
and tribulations of the low class 
family is treated with such superb 
understanding and depth, the film 
emerges as a worthwhile endeavor
The fate of a self-satisfied rail
road engineer, expertly portrayed 
by director. Fietro Germi, under
goes change when he demands the 
loveless marriage of his pregnant 
daughter. Further conflicts arise 
as his wife attempts to unite the 
family, despite her husbands 
strong convictions against it. When 
the eldest son, embittered by his 
fathers savage treatment of his 
mother, leaves home, the once 
loving family reduces itself to 
tormented one.
One of the most touching as
pects of the film is the insight of 
the youngest son, thoughtfully por
trayed by Edoardo Neuola. The 
precocious little boy is well aware
of the saddening incidents and of 
the decredation of his father. His 
perceptive reactions to his en
vironment, and his undeniable role 
as a stabilizing influence on his 
family should not be missed.
Also enhancing the film is the 
relationship between the mother 
to her confused daughter, and the 
final attempt of the father to elev
ate himself in the eyes of his 
family.
*The Railroad Man* is a beauti
ful conception of both tragedy and 
tenderness in the lives of a family. 
It is precise and realistic, and 
most important, the viewer can 
easily identify with its sadness and 
gladness.

States presence in South Vietnam 
is one of the elements necessary

assure self-determination to the 
South Vietnamese.
The final resolution was a com
promise, with the more radical 
students wanting a bigger slap at 
the government and the more con
servative students also slightly 
disappointed. In the liberals in
formal caucus, any demand for im
mediate withdrawal of American 
troops had been squelched.
An amendment made it clear 
that the delegates thought students 
should be heard on subjects of 
national purpose and concern.
This resolution and others are 
intended to do more than merely 
reflect the opinions of the students 
leaders representing their cam
puses. They must also serve as 
guidelines for the NSA internation
al affairs vice president in his 
dealings in the diplomatic world of 
international student cooperation 
and meetings.
Since NSA is a loose confeder
ation of student governments, the 
congress can only make recom
mendations to its member cam
pus units. Thus, the delegates 
primarily create policy and proiect mandates for the national of
ficers. The resulting national pro
grams guide and serve the indi
vidual campuses, providing direc
tion and a link.
So the final practical question 
is whether the delegates can car
ry back some of the congress en
thusiasm to their campuses and 
lead this vast number of citizenstudents, eager to participate in 
society, in the spirit with which 
the congress concludedthe sing
ing, one after the other, of the 
National Anthem and We Shall 
Overcome.*

stage production, Don Juan, or

The cast includes: Stephen Lim

er; lighting designer, William Nilson; and costume designer, Joseph 
Bella are all members of the 
drama faculty. The set is a me
chanically operated revolving 
platform. Costumes are lush bro
cades in a Romanesque style.
The play itself is a satire of 
modern mores and hypocrisy in 
which the author employs the 
legend of Don Juan. In this modern 
version, Don Juans greatest love 
Is geometry. The myth of his des
cent into hell is a theatrical hoax 
created to enable him to escape 
the tedium of his life.

Armchair Critics
In response to suggestions offered by some members 
of both the student body and the faculty, President 
Stever has held a meeting of the Athletic Board, the 
presidents primary advisory group on athletics, to 
initiate a review of Carnegie Techs athletic policies 
and programs.
In anticipation of this meeting, which took place 
yesterday, the Tartan published last week an article 
summarizing the opinions regarding athletic policy 
offered by one group of students, the members of the 
Undergraduate Advisory Committee. At the end of 
this article, the Tartan stated, Students who want 
their opinions on athletic policy voiced, should con
tact the members of the board. The names of stu
dent, faculty, and alumni representatives to the Ath
letic Board were listed.
Many students on this campus have been heard in 
the last few years to criticize and even to ridicule 
Carnegie Techs athletic policies. Now they have 
been provided with a means to make their point of 
view known to the administration through their rep
resentatives on the board. To determine the extent 
to which students took advantage of this opportunity, 
the Tartan recently questioned a number of the stu
dent and faculty members of the presidents athletic 
board.
It was discovered that very few students did in 
fact take the time to initiate discussions of Carnegie 
Techs athletic policies with their representatives.
Clearly, a knowledge of student opinion is a vital 
prerequisite to any attempts which might be made 
to rectify the problems associated with this in
stitutions athletic programs. Nevertheless, only a 
handful of students bothered to make known their 
views to the appropriate members of the board.
It appears in light of these facts that most Carnegie 
Tech students are merely armchair critics: they are 
content to criticize matters which do not please them, 
but, given the opportunity to actively participate in 
the improvement of their problems, they exert no 
energy to take advantage of it.
Radical changes in Carnegie Techs athletic policies 
may ultimately result from the actions initiated by the 
Athletic Board. In view of this fact, the Tartan urges 
students to take a more active interest in these 
matters, and to make the effort to bring their opinions 
to bear on the formulation of future athletic policy.

Newton County
In Newton County there are 
13,000 whites and 6,000 Negroes. 
Out of 3,000 Negroes of voting 
age, less than 1% vote. The ave
rage number of school years com
pleted is through the sixth grade. 
Even this is high for most Mis
sissippi Negroes. These facets, 
however, do not speak for Newton 
County. The people's talk, their 
experiences and their faces, the 
unspoke, unwritten facts, speak 
for themselves.
Newton County was my home for 
the rest of the summer. The day 
we moved into our. house I thought 
I was in a palace. It had {dumb
ing and electrical luxuries - these 
I didnt think we would have. We 
soon met Mr. X., a Newton man 
who had done much to help us get 
established. Mr. X told us that the 
Negroes In Newton are different 
from the Negroes in Philadelphia 
... in that Sheriff Rainey would 
not be walking the streets today 
if he had lived in Newton. Mr. X 
and several others stayed up at 
night to guard the house.
The people we met were very 
receptive and we soon saw how re
ligious they were. Some felt that 
God had sent us as he sent Christ 
many years before. George, our 
director, told the 50 people who 
were on hand to greet us, God 
makes a path, when he gives a
person strength and health but he 
does not ever cross the line into 
human responsibility. If you take 
one step, the Lord will take two. 
Unfortunately, many ministers did 
not feel this way. The ministers 
who had previously agreed to let us 
speak at their churches were now 
refusing, for the white people were 
putting pressure on them. Some of 
the Negroes jobs were already 
being threateend if they dared come 
to our functions, still, many Ne
groes supported us. Our ice-box 
was soon full of food that they had 
brought indicating their loyalty and 
trust.
One reason for this support was 
that a seventeen year old Negro 
girl was raped by a white Newton 
man three weeks before. This white 
man had since left town on $500.- 
00 bail. It was doubtful that when 
tried he would be convicted. Out of 
the 27 murders of civil rights 
workers brought to court in the 
last three years, there has not been 
a single conviction. The attacker 
of one of our marches (Novem
ber 11) was tried and found inno
cent. The judge felt our man and 
his witness were in no position 
to identify the assailant. This Is the 
justice that the Negro has put up 
with for 150 years and that thecivii 
rights worker must deal with today.
Platform For Citizen - Students
Campus student governments, 
long scorned by student activists 
as pallid reflections of adminis
tration policy, are beginning to as
sume a vital role in the campus 
movements for educational and 
social reform. The growth of active 
student political groups, covering 
the whole political spectrum, has 
taught students that the boundaries 
of their classroom are actually the 
boundaries of the world. Now stu
dent government officers are 
striving to join the molitant lead
ers in order to bring a sense of 
vitality and involvement into the 
student government.
Because of the strength of this 
movement the eighteenth annual 
Congress of the National Student 
Association, a confederation of

took its firmest stand so far in sup

campus, community, and national 
affairs. In essence the Congress

By John Day 
Don Carter 
David Henderson
Your columnists last week, ever 
on top of the news, found them
selves in New York covering the 
draft card burnings in Union 
Square. The square, once the gath
ering place of the social rebels of 
the thirties, and now the haven for 
the old park bench philosophers, 
regained for one day at least, its 
reputation as the center of the 
countrys radical movements. This 
time, however, the big issue was 
the criminal and barbaric war 
in Vietnam.*
We arrived twenty minutes ear
ly and found a large crowd already 
gathered. Policemen were erect
ing barricades to control the ex
pected 2000 spectators, sympa
thizers, and opponents of the spec
tacle, and newsmen and photo
graphers were everywhere inter
viewing anyone with an opinion. 
Carpenters were finishing the 
speakers platform and an Ameri
can flag on a scrap of timber was 
hastily added.
The chairman of the event, Dr. 
Gordon Christianson, called for 
order and non-violence. With the 
crowds silence, a new element ap
peared. On the sidewalk opposite 
the platform about 100 pickets and 
hecklers began a loud but inarticu
late chant which they were to con
tinue faithfully for the two hours of 
the meeting. There were many 
carrying signs; two of the more 
classic were; *Red finks go to 
Moscow* and Thanks commies, 
queers, and cowards.  Mao Tse 
Tung."
One David McReynolds was in
troduced and read a statement of 
support for the burners. The 100 
signers of the statement con
demned the war as a barbaric 
action* and offered to aid and abet 
....all those whose conscience 
leads them to openly and non-vio
lently to resist the United states 
war effort in Vietnam.*
After an appeal for blood dona
tions for Vietnamese of all fac
tions, the Rev. A. J. Muste, the 
octagenarian grand old man of 
pacificism, was helped to the plat
form. His subject was Norman 
Morrissan, the man who the week 
before had burned himself to death 
before the Pentagon. Incredibly, 
Rev. Muste praised Morrissons 
suicide as a brave act and de
clared even sympathy inapprop
riate. No mention was made of 
the baby Morrisson dropped at the 
last minute.
Early the next week a young 
member of the Catholic Worker 
movement who almost certainly 
heard the Rev. Muste set him
self afire before the U.N. prob
ably to the Reverends great 
delight.
Dorothy Day (hailed by the heck
lers as Moscow Mary) editor of 
the Catholic Worker, organ of the 
movement to which David Miller, 
the first of the burners belonged, 
spoke briefly.
Then in a superb tension build
er, the five burners were intro
duced individually and gave their 
reasons for burning their cards. 
The statements were familiar, 
based more on ideas than the usual 
complex political rationales. The 
burners, finally all assembled and 
all speeches finished, took out their 
cards and moved to stage center.
Marc Paul Eddman, the young
est of the burners, produced the 
lighter and ignited it. As the draft 
cards were thrust into the flame, 
a jet of water accurately aimed 
from the crowd completely extinquished the flames. The volunteer 
fireman was sized by the police 
and the ceremony continued with 
wet cards. Nearby us a member 
of the proletariat, in a construc
tion workers hardhat and aviator's 
leather jacket began to sing This 
Little Light of Mine.* The song 
swelled as the drier cards caught 
fire and those too wet to burn were 
torn up and thrown into the crowd. 
It was quite a musical afternoon 
topped off by the ever popular and 
adaptable We Shall Overcome.*
Dr. Christianson then asked the 
crowd to leave in an orderly man
ner with no violence. This was 
done except for a few fierce verb
al altercations. The whole affair 
was at best anticlimatic. Were it 
not for the young man who immo
lated himself at the U. N. last 
week, the Union Square rally would 
hardly be worth mentioning, but he 
symbolizes to us the tragic and 
senseless course of this new move
ment on the left.
colleges and universities, repre
senting one-fourth of the students 
in American higher education. In 
a series of policy decisions, they 
emphasized that both students and 
student governments should be 
where the action is.
To this end, the congress came 
to the support financially and phil
osophically of the Free Speech 
Movement at the University of 
California. The resolution, passed 
274 to 19 after four hours of 
floor debate and a week of con
tinuous discussion, strongly af
firmed the rights and duty of 
students to participate fully in 
society. The delegates than urged 
the individual student governments 
to raise money to pay for legal ex
penses of students arrested in the 
incidents at Berkeley.
Active Protest 
Broadening this principle, the 
delegates instructed NSA officers 
To offer all possible support in 
the form of fund raising, publicity, 
mediation, and coordination of sup
port efforts of member campuses 
for any protest movement taking 
place on the campus of a member 
school and whose ends and means 
are in accord with NSA policy.* 
Actions proposed for dealing 
with off campus affairs were equal
ly militant. In a resolution on The 
Student and the City,* the congress 
said that students had an import
ant role in eliminating slums by 
actively working in the community 
to develop leadership and organi
zation.* Social action and civil 
disobedience were again endorsed 
as means of forcing action.
The delegates also told their 
officers to begin a program of 
action aiding the nonviolent civil 
rights movements. This position 
is not completely new for the 
congress, which has been sup
porting civil rights for a long 
time, a position which has led to 
the withdrawal of some conserva
tive members. Now the delegates 
have instructed their officers to 
be ready to act wherever and 
whenever the next confrontation 
should develop.
Vietnam 
The most time-consuming single 
subject at the congress, however, 
was Vietnam. The debate began in 
the opening days of the meeting in 
a seminar on Asia, and concluded 
with a resolution calling on the 
United States Government to stop 
the bombing of North Vietnam as 
a positive step toward a cease 
fire," but saying that the United

Chairman Reviews 
Congress Activities
The following is a statement prepared by Dick Elder, chairman of 
Student Congress.ed._____________________________
Student Congress has been a good target for criticism in the past 
few years. Much of the criticism has been deserved and when there has 
been none, the fault has lain more in the apathy which generated the 
tolerance than in the perfection of the Congress.
Few people would deny the right of criticism or uphold the spotlessness 
of the present Congress, either, for it is guilty of much of the same 
faults as the past Congresses.
The present Congress has been in more or less of its current condi
tion for one and a half semesters. It has been wide open for the cri
ticism of those who would demand a record of major accomplishments 
and an internal solidity, neither of which are available at present. 
But this Congress is not doomed to the mistakes and failures of the past.
There was no deluge of applications for committee chairmanships 
following the elections in the spring. Neither were there obvious choices 
or possibilities, but the present list of committee chairmen is impres
sive in accomplishments as well as in potential.
Committee Success
The Freshmen Orientation Committee furthered the calibre of its 
program and demonstrated a strong organization structure which had 
not always been true in the past. It provided new ideas and pushed 
for necessary changes.
Despite the attacks it has received, the Homecoming Committee spon
sored a very successful weekend. The quality of its entertainment was 
high and the problems it encountered were smoothly overcome.
The General Campus Committee has initiated a study of the cur
rent I.D. cards which is now well in progress. As soon as the excava
tion included in the new administration building has been completed 
beside Skibo, a new all-campus bulletin board will be erected as a re
sult of this committees sponsorship. In addition, the committee struc
ture for continuing its calendar study and will soon establish sub
committees for library relations and for studying the Carnegie Tech 
parking problems.
The results of the Finance Committees work have been apparent in 
the final draft of the 1965 - 66 student activities budget which had been an 
impossibility last winter. The committee has been instrumental in the 
current stage of student organizations debts erasure and will continue 
to be until the job is completed. It has prepared an accurate student 
activities budget 1966 - 67 after a well structured preliminary and study 
and is currently studying possible additional sources of Congress 
revenue.
The Activities Committee has established the procedure for reviving 
a campus humor magazine and will soon prepare a report on the cur
rent state and number of recognized student activities on campus. 
It has sponsored recognition of a new student group and will be ini
tiating activity for sponsoring a leadership workshop conference.
Current work of the Union Committee has been recognized in both 
the proposals for improving the current use of Skibo and for its pre
liminary work on student needs in a new union. Its survey and meetings 
have encouraged optimism for action where little action has been ob
vious in the past.
The Tech Committee has organized and promoted more school spirit 
than has been present in the past few years. It has arranged for buses 
to Case and to Grove City for the football games and has organized 
two bonfires  all in conjunction with the cheerleaders.
The Campus Chest Committee has concluded a campaign charac
terized by organization and the inclusion of the proceeds of a home 
football fame to the drive.
The New Constitution
A procedure for and the establishment of a need for a new constitution 
have been the results of the Constitution Committees work. The com
mittee should have a completely revised and meaningful constitution 
to replace the nearly useless one now, by early in the second semester.
New committees have been established for revising the student Hand
book and voicing the opinion of the students on academic affairs and on 
the food service. A new handbook should be prepared by early second 
semester, as a result of the work of the committee which has included 
surveying one hundred schools for their handbooks.
Some of the Academic Advisory Committee met with the Admini
strations Academic Affairs Committee on Monday and began creating 
a structure for establishing student feelings in an area previously void 
of organized student participation.
The Student Food Service Committee has begun to organize a Com
mittee which will represent the feeling of all students on the Food Ser
vice and which will have an active part in establishing policy in an area 
which is obviously student oriented but not always reflecting the desires 
of the clients.
The Publicity, Assembly, Elections and Spring Carnival Committees 
have yet to prove themselves but none is negligent in preliminary 
work.
Wasted Time
Too much of Congress has been occupied, however, with explanations 
and reports from these committees and the chairman. Too many meet
ings have been small ones to establish procedure and too much work and 
knowledge has been concentrated in too few people.
Now that most of the procedures have been established the direc
tions for action are apparent. TTie preliminaries have perhaps taken too 
long and the actual membership of Congress has been in flux too long 
because of dormitory elections, but now everythin is in readiness.
Congress is not a body designed to meet bi-weekly and in a vague 
sense represent the student body by an occasional voice or hand vote. 
Congress is designed to represent the student body by establishing 
a working government which both supports and is responsible for student 
organizations and which establishes procedures for worldwith the 
administration to express student feelings in appropriate areas. Every 
representative should be an active participant in student government 
and should reflect student opinion beyond his own decision when that de
cision happens to be needed. Committees are only as effective as the 
support they are given and the dynamism of a committee chairman can
not substitute for an entire committee when apathy is in control.
Relations between the Administrations and Student Congress are at a 
high point and with the preliminaries out of the way. Student Congress 
can prove the value of student government to both the school and the stu
dent body by effective action in every area it undertakes. Student Con
gress has the potential for effectiveness in its representatives and it 
must now prove itself by action.

Harriers Tie Gannon In invitational; 
Waynesburg Freshman Sets Record
Carnegie Tech and surprising Gannon tied for first place in the first 
Carnegie Invitational Cross-country Meet last Saturday while Doug 
Crause Waynesburgs amazing freshman, broke the Carnegie Tech 
record for Schenley Park by a solid 24 seconds.
Crause crossed the finish line
all alone at 22 minutes and 47 
seconds, eclipsing Chris Macoskos year-old record of 23:01 for 
the fastest time on the Schenley 
track in a Carnegie Tech meet. 
(The all-time Schenley Park rec
ord is 21:07, set by NCAA cham
pion Elmer Barton of Ohio Uni
versity in a meet with Pitt.
3 Tech Men Finish High
In the Invitational Macosko and 
Roger Cairns took second and third 
for Tech in 23:38 and 23:42. Har
ry Burkholder gave the Tartans 
three men in the first ten by tak
ing seventh at 24:01. Eric Levine 
finished 15th and Kem Phillips 24th, 
to give Tech a point total of 51.
This score matched Gannon, 
which took 5th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 
and 14th places. The previous week 
in the last meet of the regular 
season, Gannon had lost 21-34 to 
Tech at Schenley Park. 
Waynesburg 3rd
Westminster took second place 
in the Invitational with 56 points, 
and Waynesburg was third with 60. 
Waynesburg and Westminster were 
the only teams to beat Tech this 
year, both on their own courses. 
This was the first loss of the year 
for Waynesburg, which broke Car
negie's 42-game win streak and 
tied Westminster for the West Penn 
Conference championship.
Geneva and St. Francis finish
ed far out of the running with 146 
and 161 points, respectively. St. 
Francis didnt even place a run
ner in the top 20.
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, presi
dent of Carnegie Tech, was on 
hand to present medals to the in
dividual winner (Crause) and the 
first ten finishers, and a trophy to 
the winning team. He graciously 
presented the trophy to Gannon,
although he said that giying it away 
goes against our Scottish tradi
tion.
Times of the first ten runners 
were:

Council Criticizes 
Circle Congestion
Womens Dormitory Council has 
been concerned with the problem of 
congestion in the Morewood Gar
dens circle not only at the closing 
hour on week-ends but through
out the day. The situation, we un
derstand, has been aggravated by 
persons other than the residents of 
Morewood Gardens, their visitors, 
and those who have occasion to 
visit the dormitory in an official 
capacity.
It is our desire that the circle 
remain open for the movement of 
traffic occasioned by these. There
fore, Womens Dormitory Council 
has requested the campus security 
department to enforce the No 
Parking regulations, using its 
own judgment in doing so. Visitor 
parking is available in the parking 
area at the rear of the dormitory 
after 5 p.m. and week-ends.

The Grad Nads (last years Internationals team) rolled towards 
their second straight intramural soccer championship last week with a 
7-0 victory over TDP and a fearful 18 to 1 trouncing of DTD. These wins 
gave the Nads a 5 and 0 record in the Browns League (as of Saturday,
November 13.)
Only serious competition in the 
Browns League is PiKA Gar
net, which blanked TDP 4-0 for 
its third shutout and then beat DTD 
5-1 as Vic Sabella scored all five 
goals. PiKA plays the Grad Nads 
this Friday.
Packers League
In the Packers league the Dorm 
Trojans, BTP, and SN are fighting 
it out for first and second place. 
The Trojans and the Betas re
mained undefeated last week, while 
SN lost its first game, 2-1 to BTP. 
BTP also beat ATO 6-1 and GSIA 
5-1, while the Trojans won 2-0 
over GSIA and 8-2 over ATO 
and SN nosed out PKAs "Gold 
B-team 2 to 0. The first-seeded 
Trojans played BTP yesterday and
meet SN Friday, so league playoff 
spots were still up in the air at 
press time.
The playoffs start Saturday, with 
the first-place team in each league 
playing the second - place team 
in the other league. The consola

championship on Tuesday, Novem

Rifle Squad 
Wins 3 Of 4
ky 5trhh GtCrn?BtS
Shooting against three second 
rate teams, the Carnegie Tech var
sity rifle team rolled to three easy 
victories before suffering their 
first defeat at the hands of Penn 
Military College.
Duquesne, long the patsy of the 
Allegheny Intercollegiate Rifle 
League, was Carnegies first vic
tim by the lopsided score of 1379 
to 1219. Howard Graham led the 
Tartans with a 278, followed by 
Scott McCormick with a 277.
W&J was Techs second vic
tim, falling by the score of 1392 
to 1349. Captain Dick Damberg 
finally hit his stride with a fine 
99-95-90 for 284. Howard Gra
ham turned in a 281, while fresh
man Bruce McKelvy surprised 
everyone with a 277.
St. Francis, in its first year of 
rifle competition, was the next to 
fall by the ridiculous score of 1388 
to 1132. Graham was high man 
again with a 281, and freshman 
McKelvey fired a superb 280.
Penn Breaks 1400
Carnegie finally ran into some 
first class competition as Penn Mi
litary College came to Pittsburgh 
and fired a 1403 while the Tar
tans could only manage 1380. Ted 
Mankovich and Dick Damberg both 
had 278s, Techs high score for 
the day.
Carnegie needs to start pushing 
the 1400 mark if they are to nose 
out Allegheny and Indiana for the 
AIRL title. With Damberg, Gra
ham, and McKelvy holding up their 
ends, it will be up to veterans 
McCormick, Mankovich, Fritz, 
Froelich, and Westlake to hit their 
stride and come up with a few 280s. 
If Kay Dryden could shoot in a 
match the way she does in prac
tice, her score could also help the 
Tartans.

The Prexies, who made only 
six first downs and completed just 
one pass against the Tech defense, 
could put together no sustained 
drive longer than 25 yards. Their 
only offense was capitalizing 
on Tech punts.
Early Deficit
W. & J. took a 7-0 lead in the 
first quarter when Gerry Angell 
scored from one yard out. The 
scoring opportunity was set up 
when Jim Williams punt was 
blocked at the Tech 25-yard line.
They scored again early in the 
second period after Patty Rega 
returned a punt 45 yards to the 
Tech 15. On third and one at the 
Tech six, Angell broke loose off 
tackle for his second touchdown 
to give W. & J. a 13-0 edge.
But Tech then struck for two 
TDs and a 14-13 lead that lasted 
until late in the fourth quarter.
Defensive back Ken Batorski 
set up the first one by intercep
ting a deflected pass at the W. 
& J. 30 and returning it to the 
15. Three plays later Dick Bell 
slanted into the right corner of 
the end zone and Tom Hubka hit 
him with a perfect over-the-shoulder pass. Fred Browns conversion 
kick was, appropriately, blocked.
The Tartans hit . the scoring 
column again after a long 85 - 
yard drive. Chuck Zak and Larry 
Getto ground out a first down to 
the Tech 30, and passes to Bell 
and Jim Clark moved the ball to 
the W. & J. 35. Pass interfer
ence was then called against two 
W. & J. defenders who were all 
over Bells back to give the Tar
tans the ball on the 13, and on 
third down Hubka spotted Bell 
between two W. & J. men in the 
end zone and threaded the needle 
for another touchdown pass. Dick 
Merrill, playing with a heavily tap
ed shoulder, took a two-point con
version pass to give Tech a 14- 
13 lead at halftime.
Hubka Taken Out
own territory.
This field-position advantage 
payed off for the Presidents when 
with five minutes to go in the fi
nal period W. & J., which has block
ed ten punts this year, blocked a 
Tech punt at the 8-yard line. The 
ball bounced into the end-zone, 
where W. & J.s Rich McGiffin 
fell on it. Prexy quarterback Bill 
Soudan passed for a two-point 
conversion (his only completed 
pass), and W. & J. led 21 to 14.
Rally Fails
At this point Hubka came back 
into the game, and the Tartans 
twice came painfully close to pull
ing out a victory. Working from 
the shotgun formation to protect 
his injured leg, Hubka moved the 
Tartans from their own 26 to the 
Prexy 29 on five passes but on 
third down and one at the 29. 
The Tartans elected to try two 
more passes. Both went incom
plete, and the Presidents took 
over on downs.
Tech got the ball back imme
diately, though. The Tartans front 
line poured through on W. & J, 
halfback Angell and knocked the 
ball loose, and Ken Stalker recov
ered for Tech. Hubka hit Bell for a 
first down at the 12, but the fran
tic Presidents broke up a couple 
pass plays and took over on downs 
again. With just 33 seconds left, 
W. & J. punted out and Tech re
turned to the 30 for one last 
chance.
But on first down, Hubka was 
thrown for a loss. He completed 
one more pass, to Bell at the 25, 
but time ran out before the Tar
tans could get off another play.
Thus W. & J. finished the years 
with a 4 and 4 record, while the 
Tartans closed with one win and 7 
losses. Tom Hubka threw 15 touch
down passes this year, probably an 
all-time Tech record, and Rich 
Bell caught 9 touchdown passgs for 
62 points to put him among the 
district leaders in scoring.
Early in the third quarter, Tom 
Hubka hurt his ankle on a rollout 
and had to leave the game in favor 
of freshman quarterback Joe Chernay performed adequately, but 
Techs big passing punch was gone 
and the Tartans spent most of the 
rest of the game deep in their
3 Seniors Leave
Three Seniors played their last 
game for Carnegie Tech. They 
were big Bill Coleman, end and 
co-captain; Dick Smokey Mer
rill, co-captain and All-District 
fullback in 1964; and center Tom 
Glassberg.
