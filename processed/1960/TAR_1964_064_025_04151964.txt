An administration hall, to be 
constructed through the generosity 
of Mrs. Alan M. Scaife and her 
family, will be the center of an 
entire new entrance to be develop
ed to the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology campus.
The receipt of a $1,600,000 gift 
from the Scaife family for that 
purpose was announced today by 
Carnegie Tech president Dr. J. C. 
Warner,
The administration building and 
entrance plaza represent the first 
step in the development of a new 
front door for the Tech campus.
Subsequent steps will include 
a two level parking structure to 
the west and development of an 
integrated site for an important 
future building.
The entrance plz will be de
veloped as an informal gathering 
place for students, containing at
tractively landscaped areas and 
benches. Located on the south side 
of Forbes Ave., the building will 
face Forbes near the intersection 
of Morewood Ave.
The building was designed by 
Charles Luckman Associates, of 
New York and Los Angeles, and 
will contain 44,000 square feet. 
Rising six levels above the ground, 
it will effect economics by bring
ing together .all of the administra
tive functions now widely spread 
around the campus.
 This new administration build
ing is the second structure made 
possible by the Scaife family since 
the start of Techs development 
program in 1957. The other, the 
Alan M. Scaife Hall of Engineer
ing was formally dedicated in 
October, 1962, and was built with 
a $1,250,000 gift. It is located 
on Frew St., at the Schenley Park 
entrance to the campus.
Ground breaking ceremonies for 
the new structure are expected to he held early this summer. It is 
hoped the building will be ready 
for occupancy by September. 1965.
Termed by the architect, . a 
model administration^ building, it 
is the thirteenth major structure 
erected at Tech since the ten-year 
development program began in 1957.

Doherty Hall, three fraternitydormitory complexes, major addi
tions to Mudge Graduate House 
and Morewood Gardens, the new 
stadium and athletic facility, the 
campus activities center, the Hunt 
Library, a major addition to Mar

size and scope of our education
al and research programs, and the 
projected future growth of these

experience in these positions. Our 
expansion in the fields of ma
terials science, applied space sci
ence, urban design, the new mas
ters' program in Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie College, and other

M.S., and D. S. degrees from Car
negie Tech and joined the faculty 
in 1946. In 1952, he was made

trical engineering, and from 1957- 
60, he served as acting head of

served as Dean of Research.
Dr. McCabe received his B.S. 
degree from Dickinson College 
and his D. Sc. from Carnegie

following three years as an in

Congress Platforms Presented
Porter Emphasizes 
Strong Leadership
Today Student Government, and especial
ly Student Congress, is fighting to get more 
rights for the students and to'maintain what 
rights we now have. But how is it doing this? 
Every time that something has happened 
(e.g., a decree from the Administration, or 
other types of infringements upon stdent 
| rights) the Congress and the 
r~i? Government have reacted 
;V; with letters which stated our 
y* position. With these letters 
we expect to get action; ac1 tion in our favor. But how 
j can we expect this action 
when within our own struc
ture we are failing? There 
I are more student organiza' tions in debt now than ever 
before. And their combined and singular 
debts are also larger than ever before. But 
th poor finances are only' a symptom of 
poor organization within these groups. Not 
only this, but our own committees are doing 
their jobs very inefficiently. They are not 
doing their jobs in full, but only that which 
is absolutely necessary.
What cn Congress do? Before we can 
effectively fight to get more rights for the 
students, we have to be able to show that 
we can handle our own problems. For who 
would respect the requests of an organiza
tion which could not meet its own prob
lems? We must repair our own structure 
before we can expect to be listened to! If 
we can develop an internally strong gov
ernment, it will, by natural course of action, 
also become strong externally.
The strength of Congress can be improv
ed, only with the cooperation of the chair
man and the student body. I plan to provide 
initiative for the other leaders in order to 
spark them into action to improve Congress 
along the following lines:
1. Through the use of Committees.
Now there are only few committees
which are fulfilling more than just the bare 
minimum of leadership in their respective 
areas. By proper choice of these committee 
heads and by sparking them into action, we 
would be able to give more help to organi
zations who are having administrative and 
financial problems. This could be largely ac
complished through the Activities Commit
tee and the Finance Committee, which up to 
the present have provided no leadership in 
these areas. Other Committees are supposed 
to gather information and present it to Con
gress, rather than have the main body sweat 
through this task during its meetings.
2. Through the use of the Assistant
Chairman
The Assistant Chairman of Congress, 
has, in the past, been nothing more than 
chairman of the Rules Committee; nothing 
more than a records keeper. There is great 
potential in this office to take charge of 
various areas of Congress more effectively. 
He should be able to help coordinate and act 
as liaison between Student Congress and 
the Activities and the student body.
3. Through Better Use of Congress Time
A Congress meeting should not be a
place for bringing up new ideas without their 
review by committee, nor should it be a 
Committee of the Whole every meeting. 
There is a suitable mechanism for bringing 
new business to the floor, provided through 
Departmental representatives and Congress 
Committees. Congress is not meant to be the 
Campus Bulletin Board, as it has been treated 
many times. By improving the efficiency of 
these meetings, we could not only accom
plish more, but also improve our prestige on 
the campus.
4. Coordination with Honoraries
By coordinating this improvement of 
Student Activities with the Campus Activi
ties Honoraries, we could bring highly com
petent- individuals into contact with these 
"ailing groups to help them to get back onto 
their feet.
This is not going to be an easy task; to 
improve Student Congress internally. But I 
hope to enthuse others with a new spark to 
attempt new'ideas and to enter new areas, 
to help all of' the-Campus Activities and 
surely the student body.
All of this internal strengthening will reH
Sandulli Stresses 
Good Communications
Congress has finally reached a state of 
technical efficiency with more business
conducted in less time by referring motions
to committees for thorough preparation. 
With the actual operation of Congress on a 
firm basis the Chairman can develop a Con
gress more aware of the campus and a camp
us more aware of Congress. ^
We must encourage V 
communications system wilh 
information exchange in b jth 
directions. We must be able * -  -
to explain' our stand to pi  
pie, as well as be conscious .* i. 
of their feelings toward us 
The Congress Chairman;, 
efforts should be applied to 
maintaining and developing 
two avenues of information exchange,, be
tween Congress and the administration. The 
importance of communication is most acute
ly evident when it fails and we find our
selves bestowed with things we really dont 
need, like parking meters and an extra class 
day at Thanksgiving.
Congress and Students
Congress is responsible for sensing the 
needs of the campus and its organizations in 
time to satisfy them. Once the needs are 
recognized, Congress can easily be adapted 
to them; as it was in the creation of Tech 
Committee to lead school spirit (a need Tech 
has had since its last game with Notre 
Dame). The campus must be made aware 
of what Congress is doing and be brought 
closer to Congress, by our establishing a 
diligent publicity campaign, and by our 
telling people what we are going to do 
ahead of time, so that interested non-mem
bers can make a point of attending meet
ings. People also should be informed of 
what opportunities are available through 
Congress like financial aid, publicity, and' 
pressure for their cause in the effective 
places. Organizations in close contact can 
maintain a united front in expressing stu
dent feeling.
Congress and Administration
Here the Chairman himself is primarily 
involved. Even though meetings between 
Congress Chairman and the administration 
are easily arranged, a constant effort must 
be exerted to acquaint the administrators 
with our feelings and to encourage them to 
share their feelings with us. Neither of us 
should be taken by surprise by a seemingly 
snap judgment on the part of the other. A 
tangible effort we can realize in this direc
tion is the placement of a representative of 
Congress on the schools Calendar Commit
tee. By visiting the administrators regularly 
and by sending delegates of Congress to 
keep in touch with members of the Execu
tive Board we can maintain a student lob
by of the schools policy-making body.
I believe that this good communica
tions policy will enrich the Congress meet
ings by drawing more student interest and 
will enable us to keep up a more constant 
pressure on the administration for the ac
complishment of our goals. As Congress 
Chairman I will consider it my responsi
bility to maintain a more understanding 
Congress and a more understood one.
Joe Sandulli
Joe Sandulli is the Congress Representa
tive from the Chemical Engineering De
partment. He has served as Chairman of 
Leadership Committee and Chairman of 
Freshman Orientation Week Committee, 
and as a member of Campus Chest and 
and Union Committees. In his fraternity, Pi 
Kappa Alpha, he has been Rush Chairman, 
Secretary, Pledgemaster, and Publicity 
Chairman; and has also served as a CFP 
Court Justice. He is a member of Delta 
Skull, AICHE, Varsity Track Team, and of 
Freshman Camp Staff.
fleet on our opinion in the eyes of the Ad
ministration and will bring us to a position 
of higher respect from which we will be 
able to obtain more for the student body in 
the end.

Rights
Often this column contains phrases similar to A m 
has a right ... or Government has no right . . .  Is i 
born with inalienable rights, are they, acquired, or wh 
This article will try to clear up the confusion about the usa 
of the word in this space.
If a man is born with rights, it really does not chan 
the situation as it is now; how is everyone to agree on t 
rights to which anyone is entitled? Some decision rule m 
be formulated; but the correct choice will be a- matter 
opinion.
Perhaps rights are what the legally constituted go 
ernment of an area says are rights. But governments ha 
been known to disagree. If rights are acquired by an indiv 
dual as a grant from society, then, since not all societies ha 
the same value, some men have more rights and (differe 
ones) than others. If some men have more rights than othe 
then, in fact, all men are not equal. (This does not exclu 
granting privileges based on education, etc.) Such ideas 
not have a biological basis. This concept would have to e 
plain the paradox of an individual gaining or losing righ 
when he changes his residence.
If the above is true, then society must be all powerfu 
man does not have any rights except as a member of t' 
whole. But does not man constitute society? Why does socie 
exist? To aid men achieve their goals? Or does man exi 
to help society achieve its goals? The first answer is th 
more logical (even if they majority accepts the other).
But even if it were not, another question should still 
asked: What ought to be? The word rights in this colum 
means those actions which man ought to be able to take (o 
refrain from taking) without interference from governmen' 
or other men, as the ease may be. But what "ought to be? 
This is where the other articles in this space are useful; the 
explain why certain of the writers values ought to be righ 
of all men. Of course, not everyone is going to agree wi 
the "rights any one person postulates. But this does no 
make the rights any less correct to a person who has bee 
persuaded' to accept them. What the above definition o 
rights does mean is that the mere assertion of a right i 
not enough to etsablish it; the reason why it ought to be 
must be presented and defended.
Such a way of seeking truth is not the most satisfying 
Man can never know, beyond doubt, what is a true righ 
He must continue to question. But this does not mean tha 
those values which seem most correct, persuasive, and ap 
propriate can not be called rights tentatively. This is wha 
has been done in this column.

Maggie Murph 
Demands Respect
Editor, The Tartan:
I have a bone to pick (if youll' 
forgive the expression) with the 
author of the article Expression 
Engineers which was printed in 
last week's Tartan. We poor 
Maggie Murphs are impressed 
by the accomplishments of the 
Dramats, but we are not so 
dumbfoundef as this author likes 
to think. If he had ever peeked 
into a rehearsal of Dance Work
shop, Scotch *n Soda, or even of 
a sorority Spring Carnival skit, 
I think he and perhaps even a 
few Dramats would be dumb
founded at what we staid Mag
gie Murphs can do when we put 
our minds to it. It takes just
as much self-analysis to get be
yond ones own background and 
prejudices and. a good Psychol
ogy or English paper-as it does 
to get into a character in a play.
-  Sometimes between the tal
ented Fine Arts students and the 
mathematically - oriented engi
neers I think, poor Maggie 
Murphs begins to get an in
feriority complex. There are 
many Maggie Murphs, however, 
who have quite a bit of talent 
or mathematical ability, but 
just prefer Liberal Arts! (Yes, 
there are such creatures.) There 
are some of us who believe that 
the purpose of education is to 
develop ones mind, one's ability 
to communicate and understand; 
that the final end of education 
is to make one into a more ma
ture, more capable individual 
and whether or not one has a

week; interested students should contact Keith Pierce. (It

until this summer. Dick Elder, General Campus Commit
tee Chairman, will consider improvements in the new 1966- 
1967 calendars.
A motion revising the representative structure of the 
Congress elections was passed, and a motion requiring that 
the election be held by the end of April. The budget for 
Scotch and Soda was approved, after a brief discussion item
izing some questionable entries. All were satisfactorily ex
plained to the Congress.
Three amendments to the constitution, with regard to 
structure, were discussed; they will be voted upon at the 
next meeting.From the floor came a suggestion that the Congress 
reopen consideration of the parking,, meters in Skibo lot. 
It was referred to the General Campus Committee.

They were: Joe Sandulli and Ben Porter, Vice Chairman" 
Dick Elder. The meeting was adjourned.

Substantiate Factsi 
Before Criticizing
Editor, the Tartan:
This is an answer to Paul 
Carlson, Jay Smith, and all those 
other avid fans of the anti-renta cop clan. Specifically, I am 
writing *n response . to a letter that appeared in the TARTAN on 
Mar. 18. (.Security Accused of 
Towing Cars.)
In that letter, Smith and Carl
son declare Chief Young to . be 
the lack-lusler leader of the 
Carnegie Tech Gestapo. It is 
fascinating to note that these 
critics, who accuse Mr. Young of calling the police v and initiating 
the reign of car towing terror, 
also decide to cast their reflec
tions (behind cover of the print
ed page of course) on Mr. 
Youngs personality. I am sure 
neither o the gentlemen ever met 
Chief Young. Their eloquent and 
gusty adjectives are riot back
ed up; they only border on the 
superb alliteration.
Their criticism is, at best, cri
tical with nothing constructive 
added. More appropriately, its a 
lot of bad talk without anything 
behind it. Two 'senior electrical 
engineering students are now able 
to cast judgment without know
ing virtually any information. Its amazing how the scientific meth
od has changed since I studied 
Physics.To the individuals who are un
familiar with the head of the 
security force, I wish to relate my single encounter with Mr. Young.

Psychologists 
To Begin Study
Beginning in the summer of 
1964, the Department of Psychol
ogy will conduct an Undergradu
ate Science Education Program, 
under a grant from the National 
Science Foundation. The program 
will recognize exceptional students in Psychology, and provide 
guidance and financial support 
for a research project to be con
ducted by these students.
Two undergraduate students 
will be chosen as National Science 
Foundation Honor Students for 
the summer of 1964 and the aca
demic year 1964-1965. NSF Hon
or Students will develop their 
own research projects in experi
mental psychology under the gui
dance of the project director. They 
will receive a grant-in-aid of 
$200,000, and will work on their 
projects for eight weeks during 
the summer, at a stipend of 
$60.00 per week.
Any undergraduate student is 
eligible for consideration as an NSF Honor Student. Interested 
students are invited to write to 
the project director, outlining 
their qualifications and interests. 
He is Kenneth E. Moyer, Depart
ment of Psychology, Carnegie 
Tech.

Before Criticizing
(continued Jrom page 5)
A few months ago I was one of 
those students who fell prey to a gym locker thief. Along with 
a wallet, I lost a check-book 
from which some aspiring young 
student forged a check and even 
withdrew more money than was 
in my account.
My beloved bank decided I was 
responsible, as the account had 
not been closed immediately fol
lowing the theft. With a dearth 
of lawyers to turn to, I went to 
the security office and was refer
red to Chief Young. I sought only 
advice concerning the law, lout 
received quite a bit more from 
him.
Our so called lack-luster lead
er not only procured informa
tion as to who accepts the re
sponsibility'for the theft, he later 
proceeded with me to the bank 
and demanded  through right 
of sworn forgery  that I be re
imbursed for all losses. The bank 
officials hesitated at first, but after 
several minutes of magnificent 
oratory, counsel Young won his 
case. He won it for a single stu
dent of Carnegie Tech, but in specific instances as these a man 
establishes his worth and poten
tial. Everytime Chief Young aids 
a student he is performing a ser
vice to the school.
Smith and Carlson, ask, just 
what way does the school benefit 
by the constructive  in this case 
helping students. We need men 
like Chief Young. What we need 
less of is the quick critics.

I Think...
by Richard C. Anderson
An American man is dead. Amen. He threw himself 
behind a bulldozer which, I believe, he didnt think was 
going to back up. It did ... in order to avoid other folk 
throwing themselves in front. This man was a minister of 
God. A teacher, and a Negro movement leader. I suppose 
you could call him a martyr, but^
do accidents cause martyrs? I do 
not think so. The motto of the 
Negro movement seems to be we 
shall overcome. I think it would 
be wise for us to first examine 
ourselves and to understand our
selves before we try to change 
other people. In order to explain 
this statement, I classify us as 
the Negro. Change as the Civil 
Rights Bill, and Other people 
as everyone living under the 
status quo. In other words, I 
think it would be wise for the 
Negro to understand himself be
fore having the Civil Rights Law 
imposed on the American citizen. 
In fact, it would also be wise for 
everyone to read and understand 
the Civil Rights Bill before the 
Senate and the House have a 
chance to bring action on it. If 
we do not make a concerted effort 
to look before we leap, we might 
as well rephrase the motto as: 
We shall overdo it!
If we are to take our place in 
society as conscientious objectors 
to anything, we must first reason 
and analyze, then plan and exe
cute.
But to get back to the accident:
the school whose bulldozer this 
man was trying to stop for reasoning designated as Intgra 
tion was a supposedly segregated 
Negro school. I would like some 
comment as to . how stopping the 
building of a Negro school would 
further the cause for educating 
the Negro.
I am one-hundred per cent for 
integration, but anything of this 
fragile and gigantic nature should 
be handled with extreme care and 
thought. Let us all pray for a so
lution.

Reporter Explains His

The primary purpose of the newspaper is to give news 
to the public. If that news is false or inaccurate, there can 
be no point in printing it, for the paper would soon lose the 
confidence of the people.

judice; then without personal bias 
he must earnestly desire to report 
the truth.
The more fully informed a re 
porter is, the greater his oppor
tunities. Increasing information 
comes only to the person of re
ceptive mind and broad interacts. 
In journalism, as in most activi
ties, the personality of the indivi
dual either helps or hinders his 
achievement.
The reporter is the eyes and the 
mouthpiece of the world for which 
he writes. He cannot afford to be 
indifferent or blind to any element 
in it.
What is the test of his accom
plishments?
First and very important, the 
journalists writing must be clear. 
The primary function of the 
newspaper is to give information 
and give it rapidly, impossible to 
do in vague, indefinite, ambiguous 
language.
His writing is simple and plain 
because his readers include all 
people who read his language:. It 
is terse and direct because he has 
no space to waste, and his read
ers no time to waste on unneces
sary words.
It is picturesque, vivid, realistic, 
so that it may be as near to real 
experience for the reader as 
words can create.
It is easy and fluent, in order 
to offer no reading obstacle.
It is forceful and vigorous in 
order to make its point upon the 
first reading.
It is impersonal. The writer 
tries not to get between the read
er and the story.
Last 'and most important, the 
journalists writing must be in
teresting.
These journalistic standards ap
ply all the way from the cub reporter to the newspaper colum
nist, and no part of a newspaper 
requires more skill than the writ
ing of a column.
The newspaper columnist has 
aptly been called the court jester 
of the world. Usually he is a man 
or woman of long newspaper 
training who has shown excep
tional ability in feature writing 
and has developed a style of his own.
Under an attractive heading he 
contributes to his column a series 
of observations that are an original 
blend of news, philosophy, and 
humor. His purpose is also to 
avoid sensational and exaggerated 
statements.
Such writing is usually done in 
a light, personal-essay style that 
is intimate, alluring, and easy to read.
Keep in mind, that a columnist 
doesnt buy space so that he may 
have equal opportunity to voice an 
opinion as the editor of a news
paper. He earns space through 
years of newspaper experience, 
and through his column he ad
vances a philosophy which he has 
developed over the years and to 
which people learn to identify.

Architect Superintendent of 
Walker and Weeks in Cleveland,
Ohio. For the following, six years,
Mr. Andrews was an engineer for 
U. S. Fidelity and Guaranty, also 
of Cleveland. While holding this 
position, he .furthered his education by attending Cleveland. Law 
School from 1933 to 1934. In 1940 
he became president of the Amer
ican Decorating Company, a posi
tion he still holds. During the war 
years, Mr. Andrew served as Gen
eral Manager and Secretary of 
Cleveland Aircraft Products Com
pany. Presently he is president 
of 'Andrews, Bartlett, and Associ
ates, Inc. Complementing his busi
ness activities, Mr. Andrews is

^Mr. Allen. The only logical choice 
Hr^was of course UMOC!
Approximately two hundredf
Tech students and UMOC candi

Steves private plane  came to 
iesi at the ramp it was quickly 
suiiounded by the exuberant Tech

Mr. and Mrs, Hunt Are Named 
To New Whos Who in America
Mr. Hoy A. Hunt, vice chairman of the board of trustees 
of Carnegie Tech, and his late wife, Rachel McMaster Miller 
Hunt, have been cited by Whos Who in America in recogni
tion of their substantial gifts to education in this country.
Mr. Hunt is a director of the Aluminum Company of 
America. The late Mrs. Hunt was* 
a prominent bibliophite and hor
ticulturist. Their combined inter
ests led them to donate $2,800,000 
to Carnegie Tech for the Campus*
Hunt Library.
An additional gift of $175,000 
from the Hunts provided for two 
specially designed rooms in the 
library to house fine and rare boks, of which 1650 were con
tributed from Mrs. Hunts personal collection.
Mrs. Hunts famous collection of 
priceless, rare botanical books 
and prints is housed in the pent
house of the library.
The Whos Who citation points 
out that the history of private 
education is replete with in
stances of gifts by cultural and 
industrial leaders . . . Few man 
and wife teams, however, have

Sunny weather, fan support and several outstanding 
performances werent enough to bring Carnegie Techs track 
team six more points Saturday. The team posted its first loss 
73-67 against Indiana State.
Weakness in several field events and the hurdles plus 
a last minute injury to co-captalnf
Andy Niedra hurt Tech-s chances. 
The lead shifted back and forth 
throughout the meet, Indiana 
sweeping the high jump and javlin and Tech dominating several 
running events. It came down to 
the final event, the mile relay. 
"With anchor man Niedra out, 
Coach Ed Vaines pulled Bob Dis
kin out of the hop, step and jump 
to fill the ranks. The Tech run
ner Denny Collins, George Craw
ford, Diskin, and Hank Werronen 
put in superior efforts, but inex
perience in baton axchange cost 
the Tartans the race and the 
meet.
Four Lead Tech
Four men kept Tech as close as 
she was, accounting for over half 
the team points. Four-eventworkhouse Diskin nailed first in j 
the 100 yard dash and the broad I 
jump. Werronen was a double 
winner also, taking the 220 and 
discus. Niedra managed a 440 first 
and a second in the half mile be
fore pulling up lame. Freshman 
cross country star, lanky Henry 
Burkholder, handled the distances, 
taking the miile and the two 
mile.
Indiana had outstanding per
formances in Jones and Good. 
Jones took the high jump, soaring 
6-5, and the javlin. Good won 
the hop, step and jump aod the 120 yard high hurdles.
New Names in Column
Tech saw several new faces in 
the scoring column. Little George 
Mink cleared more than double 
his height to take second in the 
pole vault.- Freshman from Ligonier, Roger Cairns, helped Tech 
sweep the mile and just lost sec-' 
ond in the mile. Another hard 
working freshman, Tim MacMil
lan, "hopped to a second in the 
tripple jump.
With improvements in second 
and third place strength, Tech 
should make Indiana their only 
loss. This Saturday the thin-clads 
face Washington and Jefferson in 
the Tech Stadium.
Spectators
Considered
Disrespectful
The growing problem of specta
tor conflict at basketball games 
was the major topic of discus
sion at a recent meeting of Tri
state athletic directors. The gen
eral complaint was that specta
tors are disrespectful and violent 
in reactions against both afficials 
and players. In various high 
schools and colleges fights among 
players have caused spectator 
rioting and serious injury.
Carnegie Tech broke off bas
ketball relations with Duquesne 
because of a rough battle which 
broke out between the players 
at a Tech - Duquesne basketball 
game. Though no such rioting has 
occurred in the Tech field house, 
officials have complained of over
bating by students.
Before future Tech games, spec
tators will probobaly be given a 
formal warning to conduct them
selves properly. The administra
tion does not suggest that Tech 
students refrain from all baiting 
of referees and players. Such (continued on page 11)

Spring football drills will be drawing to a close this 
week and with their end, head coach Joseph Gasparella .sees 
some very encouraging signs; In talking with him, he com
mented, We have the same pass receivers back this year 
that we had last, in Dave DOppolonia and Jim Black and
they each have a year of experi-*--------------------------------------------------------ence with our offensive system \ 
behind them. Jim Clark has 
shown marked improvement and 
we are expecting good help from 
Bill Coleman. Next year we will 
have to depend more on passing 
probably pass first, run later.
With Paul Wiznewski back at QB 
with a fine arm and with as good 
as  receivers as will be found in 
the league, the outlook for next 
season is quite good,
During Spring drills these last 
two weeks the Tartan gridders 
have been working mainly on 
passing and receiving mechanics.
Along with coaches Gasparella 
and Richard McCabe the receivers 
have gotten able- assistance from 
Red Mack of the Pittsburgh,
Steelers. In these workouts, the, 
players are receiving a great deal 
of individual help on passing 
. mechanics that is hard to get 
I during the rush of the fall sea
son when the emphasis must be 
placed on leam operation. Coach 
McCabee is also giving much at
tention lo pass defense, which was 
definitely lacking last year.
Working with the linesmen 
again this year are coaches Ed 
Fay and Jesse Quatse. The line
men have been on a weight pro
gram on alternating days with running on the field. Here again 
a lot of individual help is being 
given. The coaches said that next 
year's season the Tartans will be 
strong at center and guard with 
old stalwarts John Mordecai, Dave Heil, Jack Love, Linsey 
Sargent, and Bill Patula. But they 
said that there will be a lack of 
depth at tackle where Pete Mangarella and Pete Bair will be 
back.
Next seasons offense will be 
essentially the same with wideopen running and passing*. Bol
stering the running attack will be 
Dick Merril, Dave Gilchrist, and John Snyder. Wisnewski will be 
the only experienced quarterback 
but Gasparella has a great deal 
of confidence in his passing and 
ability to control the team. Doing 
the kicking will be Love, Wis
newski, and Gilchrist as last sea
son.
Tech will again run into a depth 
problem in the coming season 
especially with the NCAA switch
ing back to the free substitution 
and^ thus the platoon system. 
Since only 8 men are back from 
the basic 15 that played last sea
son and as Coach Gasparella puts 
it, that doesnt add up to 11. 
Thus freshmen could again play 
an important role in determining 
a successful campaign next year.

George (B.S.M.E., 1961) is the New Jersey Bell Engineer 
responsible for providing for telephone growth in two im
portant: central office exchange areas near New Brunswick.
On his own signature George can approve expenditures 
for additional equipment and facilities costing up to $3000 
apiece, a significant measure of his companys belief in 
his thinking and judgment.
Georges outstanding contribution as an Assistant Engi
neer in East Orange qualified him for his latest promotion. 
He had gained notice for his thoroughness in programming 
equipment additions to central offices and in bis handling 
of layout.and building work for one of the largest telephone 
buildings in the district.
George Katzenberger, Jr., like many young engineers, 
is impatient to make things happen for his company and 
himself. There are few places where such restlessness is 
more welcomed or rewarded than in the fast-growing tele
phone business.

ical art and illustration being pro
duced today. The Library staff is 
systematically collecting at least 
two works by every contemporary 
artist who is considered to be 
doing important work. All the 
works must have been published, 
arid Must be reasonably accurate

Dr Lawrence stated that 
while it is obviously important 
to preserve the fine work being 
done today, the Hunt Botanical 
Library is the only institution in 
the country which is attempting 
to do so. It is his conviction that 
the collection will some day be 
of immense value to scholars, 
artists, and other interested per
sons.
A catalog, including biographic
al information on the artists, will 
be available for the exhibition.
IM All School 
Basketball 
Team Selected
Five players from five different 
teams were elected to the 1964 
intramural All-School basketball 
team. Those making the teaifr 
were guards Frank Oliver of ATO 
and John Pavlick of DU, and front 
court men Mel Ramey of the Civil 
Hammers, Andy Komer of the 
Grads, and Bill Osterhuis of the 
Grad Physics.
Frank Oliver, the smallest man 
on the team, was the. sparkplug 
for ATO. His driving, shooting, 
and ball handling made him about 
half of ATOs offensive game.
John Pavlick was the big gun 
for Delta Upsilon. He was per
haps th best shot of all the I.M. 
basketball players, and was sec
ond in the MVP ratings.
Andy Komer of the Grad Eagles 
was th mainstay of the Grad 
team that bulled it way to the 
intramural championship. A for
mer Tech star, Andy was also 
elected the years Most Valuable 
Player for his play this season.
Big Bill Osterhuis was easily 
the outstanding player for the
Grad Physics. His work under the 
boards lifted the Grads to second 
place overall.
Mel Ramey, of the Ciyil Hamr 
mers,  is not 'as tall Kotner or 
Oosterhuis, but his jumping, ball 
handling, arid soft shooting made
his an easy choice for his lean?
The second team was made up 
of Jay Lawrence of Sigma Nil 
Chip Lynch oi Beta Theta PL 
Gene. King of the Dorm-Trojans 
and Howie Pifer and Art Saltzman of the Grad Eagles.
