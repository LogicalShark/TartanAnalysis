an-Hel Merges Skills Seven Captivating Freshmen 
To Put On A Good Show Compete For Festival Queen
Something will be missing from Fall Weekend this year, but a 
better thing will be in its place. Missing will be seven skits 
seven different sororities and in their places will be one skit 
sented by the Panhellenic Council as entertainment for the Fall 
Festival Queen and her court.
Instead of competing against each other, the seven sororities 
| will be working with each other, and the outstanding talent of each 
group will be combined to present an entertaining skit of high quality 
fThe show will go on during the intermission of the Jazz Concert on
Friday night. ?-----------------------------------------------------
the skit will be in keeping with 
this years Fall Festival theme
Mythical Magic. Each sorority 
will supply a director, a writer, 
three performers, and a member 
of costume crew.
Right now the writers, Nancy 
Sutherland, Kappa Alpha Theta;
Chris Bevevino, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma; June Helmers, Delta 
Delta Delta; Judi Shiffer, Sigma 
Kappa; Pam Chidester, Chi Ome
ga; and Andi Nnether, Delta 
Gamma, under the direction of 
Sue Weisshaus, Alpha Epsilon 
Phi, are busy finishing the script.
There is a lot of enthusiasm 
Vithin Pan Hel for the success 
of its new endeavor. Although 
there is not much time left for 
putting the show together, the 
talent and the script of the girls 
promises that it be one of the 
highlights of our new Fall Fes
tival Weekend.

Greek Displays 
To Highlight 
Fall Festival
This years Fall Festival, which 
replaces Homecoming, will 
ture a Tech campus brightly decoratec1 with fraternity displays. 
Six fraternities have volunteered 
to put up full displays with 
others putting up posters or dec
orations of some kind. The house 
presidents have promised that this 
year displays will not involve the 
late hours
The 
plays are:
Alpha Tau Omega: Perseus, the 
Tech warrior, cuts Medusas head 
off, symbolizing Techs homecom
ing game victory.
Beta Sigma Rho: Hercules sev
ers the immortal head of the 
hernaen Hydra to save Tech from 
St. Vincents.
Delta Tau Delta: Zeus, as a 
puppet master, helps the Tartans 
stomp St. Vincents.
Delta Upsilon: Pandoras box 
opens to reveal a Tartan from 
whose fingers come tongues of 
flame which sends 3 bearcats up 
in smoke.
Sigma Nu: Cerebran, the guard
ian of the gates of hell, guards 
Tech from St. Vincents Bearcats.
Theta Xi: Phaeton and the
Horses of the Sun trample the 
Bearcats.
Fall Festival:
A Big Weekend
Since 1961 was the last year 
that Tech was to hold an Alumni 
Homecoming during the school 
year, the Tech Student Congress 
has decided to sponsor a fall 
weekend to take its place.
The new Fall Festival will have 
the same events as previous 
Homecomings except that there 
will be no official alumni pro
gram. The Friday jazz concert, 
the big Saturday dance, and the 
football game are still to be a big 
part of the weekend.
Queen candidates, left to right, first row: Susan Schumacker, Charlotte Kiss, Jane Skeehaiu 
Second row: Andi Lapitski, Sally Morley, Carol McWilliams. Missing is Marge Levin.
Peter Nero And Brad Hunt Give 
Entertainment For Festival
Peter Nero, a sky-rocketing young jazz and classical pianist, and 
Brad Hunt, the popular local band leader, will provide the enter
tainment for the Fall Festival Weekend.
Nero, who has seventeen years of classical piano training includ
ing the High School of Music and Arts and the Julliard School of 
Music, has combined technical perfection with a love for jazz and a 
sparkling wit. He says, There cant be a constant sameness in the 
rendition of tunes, otherwise you are not creating anything at all.
This combination of musical styles won Pete first prize on 
Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts when he was nineteen, a tour with 
Paul Whitemans band, and a place as one of the countrys most 
popular nightclub and concert en-^ 
tertainers of today. He now has 
four fast-selling L.P.s on the 
RCA label.
The Columbus Citizen Journal 
said Listening to Peter Nero is 
something like standing on a mid
dle groung between Carnegie Hall 
and Basin Street with an ear 
turned to each. His artistry 
leaves you with the happy im
pression that Bach, Beethovan, 
and Brahms were the founding 
fathers of the Newport Festival.
Following Peter Neros Friday 
night concert will be Saturday 
is a dance featuring Brad Hunts 
Band. Brad, leading one of the 
areas most popular bands, is kept 
busy with the night club and 
country club cvircuits.

4Iax On Books 
Causes Debate 
Of Legality
By Sally Sheats
The text books we carry to 
classes each day are at the cen ffiter of a controversy. The C.I.T. 
Bookstore did not charge the 
four per cent state sales tax on 
text books during the rush for 
books at the beginning of the 
semester. Last week this tax was 
resumed by court order, but the 
debate concerning its legality con
tinues.A Philadelphia bookstore con
tested the exemption of college 
bookstores from the collection of 
Usales tax on the grounds that it 
gave unfair competitive advant
age over private bookstores. On 
October first, in the Common
wealth Court in Harrisburg, this 
private bookstore was successful 
in its bid for equal opportunity.
Mr. Floyd, Techs bookstore 
manager, did offer some hope 
that the tax may be dropped 
again. A letter he received from 
the State Department of Revenue 
^stated, The Department of 
Revenue is taking steps, through 
 the Attorney Generals Office, 
seeking to have the order of the 
court reversed. Therefore, there 
is still the possibility that Tech 
students will again be able to buy 
their text books and supplies 
without the added burden of a 
state sales tax. Lets hope the 
State Revenue Department is 
a successful in its attempt to rescind 
^the court order.

Don't Give Up The Ship
Cure for a Blunder
Is isn't the first
And it wont be the last,
And the memory of it 
Will soon be past,
For I'll forget it
The minute I make 
Some other stupid,
Silly Mistake.
By Jane Merchant 
Saturday Evening Post
The first examinations are over for most 
Carnegie students. For many, these tests 
will have meant the beginning of a profit
able and successful year at school; for others, 
they will have meant unexpected bitterness 
of failure. The former group will be satis
fied with a congratulations or keep up 
the good work. They will appreciate the 
respect and lack of criticism that has come 
from their success, and will strive through 
hard work and a conscientious effort to dup
licate the feat. The latter group will perhaps 
appreciate a few more words of encourage
ment and advice.
To presently accept these first tests as 
proof that you do not belong at Tech, that 
you do not have the high school background 
necessary to make it, that you will not be 
able to learn and catch upis most dangerJMemberF wrsie
ous in that it becomes extremely easy to 
rationalize oneself into giving up by believ
ing that it is hopeless to go on. It is false in 
that you do have the intelligence necessary 
to be a successful college student. Men train
ed in surveying student records have admit
ted you to Tech. They know you have the 
necessary capability, but they do not know 
whether you have the necessary drive, de
sire, and self-confidence. These cannot be 
taught at this late stage in the game, they 
must be inherent in each individual.
In evaluating these first tests, then, place 
the proper significance where it belongs. The 
grade or score itself means merely a small 
percentage of your accumulate efforts in a 
particular course. The attitude and outlook 
with which you emerge from these tests, 
however, can be the difference between suc
cess and failure in future. As Jane Merchant 
hints in her short rhymegrade-wise, your 
recent bluhder is water under the bridge 
attitude-wise, your recent blunder should be 
fuel for the fire. You have done the same 
thing many time before and have been cured 
why should it be any different because 
you are now in college? The sooner you get 
mad enough at yourself to stop thinking 
about it and actually do something about it, 
the better off you will be.

Tech Debates Men, Greeks, and Art
Machines Lose 
Value Of Life
Editor, the Tartan:
This past weekend I was given 
the opportunity of meeting a 
Tech student whom I shall here
by refer to as The Machine, 
since because of his lack of com
passion for human beings, he 
could obviously not be catogorized as the latter. During our 
short (but disturbing) conversa
tion, I was informed that The 
Machine believes that the study 
of all humanities is a waste of 
time, that language as we now 
know it will soon be (or should 
be, at any rate) replaced by 
mathematical symbols, and that 
human beings will also be (or 
should be) replaced by I.B.M. 
machines because I.B.M. ma
chines can do a better job of 
thinking than can man.
It is obvious that The Ma
chine would be much happier 
if he were really a machine in
stead of a human being. Imagine 
his feelings of inferiority to this 
potential superior intelligence of 
the I.B.M. His predictions, ideas 
and manner of thinking are 
frightening ones, indeed!
They are frightening because 
our society has reached the place 
in time where men give the 
value (if not more) to a clump 
of lifeless still as they do to a 
rational living being. What a 
paradox, then, is the goal of 
modern technology: man has
worked for centuries to conquer 
nature and to make the world 
a better place in which to live 
only to develop contraptions 
which can contribute much more 
to civilization than can he, mak
ing man himself a useless con
cept in his own distorted view of 
the nature of things. Somehow 
mans direction has been interierred with in such a way so 
that he no longer has a direction.
My position today, however, is 
to point out to The Machine 
the absurdity of his saying that 
the study of humanities is use
less. He claims that he does not 
contribute to society. May I ask 
him his opinion of the classical 
Greek thinkers, Plato, Aristotle, 
and Socrates? Did they not con
tribute to civilization in the field
of humanities and in a positive 
manner? Did not men like these 
have a tremendous and favor
able impact on our Western cul
ture? And are we not products 
of that culture?
Let me say that society is only 
as Valuable as the sum of its 
members. If one person in that 
society cultivates himself by 
studying the humanities, he is 
(in a small way, yet is) contrib
uting to society.
Any individual who could so 
disregard the importance and 
the value of human emotions 
and the understanding of hu
man interrelations in life as did 
my recent acquaintance, is in 
deed a machine. My only hope 
for the possible survival of man 
is that this one individuals ideas 
are not the reflection of our 
modern culture, but only those 
of one distorted sick individual.
Name Withheld
Administration 
Kills Football
Editor, the Tartan:
The weekly sacrifice of Tech 
football players has again been 
a total success. Certainly the 
coaches and players are tring 
their best to show the true 
Tartan spirit and the absence of 
old man apathy on the grid has 
certainly been conspicious these 
last home games. What then is 
the cause of our amazing record 
thus far? 0-7; 0-39; 6-25; 0-62: 
total points 6-133.
I sometimes wonder if the ad
ministration constructed a new 
stadium and field to demon
strate that Carnegie Institute of 
Technology is 100% egghead 
and nothing more than that. Is 
this why our coach (though 
competent) must be an unpaid 
volunteer, and our football play
ers have not enough weight to 
prevent being carried for scores 
of yards loss. (Thank the gods 
for the forward progress rule.) 
A man cannot live on bread 
alone nor equations nor text
books. These may be food for 
thought but . . .
The point is simply this: Lets 
have some administration support of our team as well as stu
dent support. We dont have to 
be No. 1 in the nation (!) but 
we also dont have to be ground 
into the turf every Saturday af
ternoon!
See you at the game on the 
27th, ~ . . Let us have our hearts 
in our work and play.
Sincerely,
James Henderson
Dorm Council 
Wastes Money
I feel that I speak for the en
tire dormitory community in 
commending the extraordinary 
efficient functioning of the Mens 
Dormitory Council this past 
year. Their capable handling of 
our ^mandatory activity fee is 
indicated by the numerous and 
extravagant affairs held for*thr 
residents by this group. Th<. 
splendor of these pageants, it is 
rumored, rivaled that of Neros 
Rome. In our case, however, it 
;s the Council that fiddled 
while our money burned. The 
quality of the food and enter
tainment provided is shown by 
the overwhelming attendance of 
the residents and by the Coun
cils recent financial report. In 
the aforementioned document, 
the September, 1961 balance 
was$2,000, while the May, 
1962 balance, after bills, was 
expected to be about $1,000. 
Hence, the Council made a net 
gain of $3,000 in the past year. 
Perhaps, they are becoming en
trepreneurs. Not that I am sup
porting deficit spendingindeed 
it is a shame that the federal 
government cannot work this fi
nancial miracle on our national 
debtbut it does seem logical 
that some of this money should 
have been spent on the residents 
rather than on accumulation.
Too, the Council is to be lauded 
for their foresight in appropriat
ing $120 (== one fairly decenl 
band = eight kegs of beer, etc.) 
to construct a bulletin board ir 
the Donner Hall mail room. Its 
timely messages have been read 
and acknowledged by all, I am 
sure. Too, the luxurious fluores
cent lighting aids those students

The Coming Elections
STATES RIGHTS
Do states have rights? Let us explore this question. 
Different colonies in America were formed by the English 
because different areas were controlled by different inter
ests, and also were easier to administer. These colonies 
developed into nearly independent republics soon after the 
revolution. However, the disunity caused by strong states 
in the new confederated American nation caused a minority 
to work toward, and eventually have the states adopt, a 
strong federal constitution. This constitution attempted toC 
give to the national government those duties which a 
central authority could do most efficiently, and assigned the 
rest to the states.
However,, that was over 170 years ago. Today there is 
much faster communication, better transportation, and we 
have learned much about how both our state and national 
governments operate. In the past 170 years the duties of 
governments have increased immensely. Yet no essential 
changes have taken place in the federal-state structure of 
our government. Perhaps this is because the present system^? 
is goodor perhaps it is because persons in public life 
would hesitate before eliminating any elective offices in 
the states. Certainly improvements can be made: Presi
dents could be elected by direct vote, congressional districts 
could be apportioned by population regardless of state, 
schools could be controlled by the federal government 
(which would undoubtedly raise educational standards to 
a higher level than the present one,) etc. Another ex
tremely important improvement would be the increased 
efficiency which would result from having a more profes
sional, and less partisan, control of the various administra-0 
tive functions of government. Most states are hopelessly 
corrupt^ in this field.
In fact, all the states are needed for today is to take 
care of such local matters as secondary roads, parks, etc. 
This leads me to think that states have become obsolete, 
and should be radically changed. But if any such proposal 
is suggested an immediate cry will be heardYou are 
taking our rights from us. We have a right to govern our
selves.  from the citizens of many states. But a plan to 
eliminate states (or drastically cut their powers) simply, ^ 
changes the seat of administration of government, and does* 
not in any way alter the individuals right or privileges. 
Each person would have more rights since he would be 
able to directly select the head of the national govern
ment, and he would be assured of having his vote counted 
as much for all national offices as votes in other sections of 
the country. States do not have rights. They are only one 
way of delegating authority, and should not be used when 
they outlive their usefulness or a better way of governing 
is found.

CURTAIN GOING UP! 
OKay, Already!
By Christopher Allen
The Pittsburgh Playhouses offering of the 1926 Musical Comedy, 
'Oh, Kay! is, if nothing more, an interesting piece of work. I will 
gladly recommend it to any aficianado of vintage operetta. To anyone 
else I would say, See it at your own risk; you may not like it. I 
found it very spotty, and generally thin. There were parts however, 
that saved the evening from being a total loss. One of these was the 
resurrection of some very old, worn out, but still hysterically funny 
vaudeville jokes. There are enough of these to make the show fun, 
but few enough to keep it from becoming corny. Another of the bright 
,%'pots in the show was the proof of a popular theory which lately has 
come into some doubt: Carnegie Tech Drama Dept, trained actors are 
good. If any one needs proof of the efficacy of Techs training, they 
should see Philip Price, who was graduated last June, in the role of 
the Duke. In my opinion he stands out from the greater part of the 
remainder of the cast by doing an excellent job. There is only one 
other person in the cast who rates with Phil, and that is Jack Price, 
who plays Shorty McGee, and he practically steals the show from 
the more exaulted leads.
There were many things about the show .that bugged me, too 
numerous to mention, and perhaps colored too much by my personal 
pastes; I like to see pretty chorus girls with nice legs, and men who 
at least look like men! And, although the original book, seemed to 
suit audiences of its day, and having been written by two venerable 
patriarchs of musical comedy: P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton, 
director William Glennon has seen fit to completely adapt it to his 
purposes. And the music, although all genuinely George and Ira 
Gershwins, is a potpourri of the hits from several of their shows, 
with a few of the original numbers from Oh, Kay! thrown in where 
they could not be escaped.
All in all, I cant find any real reason for a revival of Oh, Kay! 
but since its existence is a fait accompil ,the only comment I have to 
$nake is that if you are a collector, by all means go see it. If you 
are not a collector? Well, it is a nice way to kill a few hours.
not free to make this choice 
completely unto themselves.
It is regrettable, to be sure, 
that some fraternities find it nec
essary to state very explicitly in 
national charters that they will 
never admit a Negro, or a nonChristian, or some other super
ficially segregated group, but their 
right to do so, with out hinderance, cannot be denied.
This New Frontier liberalism 
is fine for hiring the unemployed, 
or for appointing federal com
mittees, but it is not ready for 
college fraternities  or better, 
college fraternities are not ready 
for it.
Maybe if Mr. Axelrad would 
burn his Candle at both ends he 
would shed more light.

Private Greeks 
Make Own Rules
Editor, the Tartan:
I fail to see any meaningful 
contradiction between Carnegie 
Techs ideals and the restric
tions associated with some of her 
fraternities. The purpose of the 
former is to develop our given in
tellectual powers, the latter to 
%*nake extra - curricular campus 
life a little more, meaningful and 
enjoyable. There is nothing in
herent in this which implies that 
the guide lines of one should 
necessarily be adopted by the 
other. Fraternities were meant to 
be, and still are for that matter, 
private organizations. That the 
administration may desire to have 
a strong, if latent, hand in some 
of the affairs of the fraternity 
V5ystem is only indicative of the 
strong influence a fraternity can

have on the life of each student 
as well as on the university in 
general.
In the final analysis, most fra
ternities come into being when a 
group of students, generally with 
some common bond among them, 
act on their desire to live, learn, 
work, and play together through 
their years in school. It is not 
so much a question of whether a 
fraternity is a private or public 
organization as it is a question 
of who will decide whom the fu
ture members of this organiza
tion will be. It ceases to be a 
true fraternity if its members are
pose the NAACP for providing 
incentive for the Negro race . . . 
to assert itself? Does he also op
pose trade unions on a similar 
basis? Without considering the 
NAACP, does he oppose assertive 
Negroes? Assertive people in 
general? Evidently the Negro is 
allowed to gain more rights oc
casionally, but is out of bounds 
in attempting to operate within 
these rights, that is, out of 
bounds in proving to the caucasions [sic] that the Negro is his
equal. We, for two, certainly 
have no trouble stretching our 
imaginations as far as Mr. Pax
ton asks, since we feel it is the 
issue of non-public public 
schools that is involved rather 
than capricious willfulness on 
Merediths part. Finally, if we are 
to take stock in definitions such 
as the one Mr. Paxton quotes; let 
us not the underlying physical 
basis of the latter and carry

Fraternities Free 
From Public Ties
Editor, The Tartan:
To Professor Huff, who evident
ly would require Tech inhabit
ants to proclaim themselves op
posed to discriminatory Tech fra
ternities before allowing them to 
bait Ole Miss:
Does he really consider the 
discriminatory fraternal organiza
tions problems to be of the same 
magnitude as that of discrimina
tory public schools? Are we to 
understand him to say that they 
are similar? Is not the Mississippi 
crisis a part of the struggle to 
make public schools in fact pub
lic, and not subject to the whims 
of the States; and is not the fra
ternity question part of a dif
ferent problem, namely the ex
tent to which private organiza
tions may be private? Must one 
oppose discriminatory private or
ganizations before vocally sup
porting Federal Law and Mere
dith et al; must one necessarily 
oppose them in the first place? 
And how strongly can one re
sist comparing Professor Huffs 
statement with the issue dodging 
of Governor Barnett, who cries 
that we should not send trigger 
happy Federal marshals to Ole 
Miss without first using them to 
wipe up Castro? Or are we to 
ignore 73 lines of Professor 
Huffs letter and to assume the 
real issue is just that found in 
the 17 lines of the third para
graph, the question of the com
position of the letter sent to 
Mississippi?

HIGH TEST, LOW TEST, NO TEST
Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, Do you 
think the importance of tests in American colleges is being 
overemphasized? (The little woman, incidentally, is not, as 
you might think, my wife. My wife is far from a little woman. 
She is, in fact, almost seven feet high and heavily muscled. 
She is a full-blooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the worlds 
hammer-throw record. The little woman I referred to is some
one we found crouching under the sofa when we moved into 
our apartment several years ago, and there she has remained 
ever since. She never speaks, except to make a kind of guttural 
clicking sound when she is hungry. Actually, she is not too 
much fun to have around, but with my wife away at track meets 
most of the time, at least it gives me somebody to talk to.)
But I digress. Do you think the importance of tests in 
American colleges is being overemphasized? I said the other 
night to the little woman, and then I said, Yes, Max, I do 
think the importance of tests in American colleges is being 
overemphasized. (As I have explained, the little woman does 
not speak, so when we have conversations, I am forced to do 
both parts.)
scMfy 4he tiwt too much (un fojweamti
To get back to testssure, theyre important, but lets not 
allow them to get too important. There are, after all, many 
qualities and talents that simply cant be measured by quizzes. 
Is it right to penalize a gifted student whose gifts dont happen 
to be of the academic variety? Like, for instance, Gregor 
Sigafoos?
Gregor, a freshman at the New Hampshire College of Tanning 
and Belles Lettres, has never passed a single test; yet all who 
know him agree that he is studded with talent like a ham with 
cloves. He can, for example, sleep standing up. He can do & 
perfect imitation of a scarlet tanager. (I dont mean just do 
the bird calls; I mean he can fly South in the winter.) He can 
pick up B-Bs with his toes. He can say Toy boat three times 
fast. He can build a rude telephone out of two empty Marlboro 
.packs and 100 yards of butchers twine. (Of all his impressive 
accomplishments, this last is the one Gregor likes to do best 
not building the telephone, but emptying the Marlboro 
packs. Gregor doesnt just dump the Marlboros out of the 
pack. He smokes them one at a timesettling back, getting 
comfortable, savoring each tasty puff. As Gregor often says 
with a winsome smile, By George, the makers of Marlboro 
took their time finding this fine flavor, this great filter, and by 
George, Im going to take my time enjoying em!)
Well, sir, there you have Gregor Sigafoosartist, humanist, 
philosopher, Marlboro smoker, and freshman since 1939. Will 
the worldso desperately in need of talerltever benefit from 
Gregors great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college to stay.
But even more tragic for mankind is the case of* Anna Li via 
Plurabelle. Anna Li via, a classmate of Gregors, had no talent, 
no gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for 
taking tests. She would cram like crazy before a test, always 
get a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything she had 
learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest honors and 
degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that she left college 
no more educated, no more prepared to cope with the world, 
than when site entered. Today, a broken woman, she crouches 
under my sofa.  um m st,u
And speaking of tests, ice makers of Marlboro put our 
cigarette through an impressive number before, ire send 
it to the market. But ultimately, there is only one test 
that counts. Do YOU like it? We think you wilL

Mosher
Publications
Exhibited
An exhibition of the publica
tions of the American publisher 
Thomas B. Mosher (1852-1923), 
will be held in the exhibit area 
of the Hunt Library, from Oc
tober 22 to November 22.
The exhibit consists of repre
sentative books and catalogues is
sued from Moshers press. It was 
organized by James D. van 
Trump of the Hunt Botanical Li
brary, and Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr., 
of the English department.
Mosher, a life-long resident of 
Portland, Maine, was perhaps the 
most famous of American finepress publishers of the 1890s and 
early twentieth century. Posses
sing great literary taste and dis
cernment, he first brought to the 
attention of the American public 
many of the now famous Europ
ean writers. He was a devotee of 
the beautful book and followed 
in the tradition of William Morris, 
but wanted to bring the products 
of the fine press to as many peo
ple as possible. His books are not
ed for their handsome format and 
delicacy of execution.
The books and catalogues 
shown are from the collection of 
Mrs. Roy A. Hunt and the organ
izers of the exhibition.
Tech Announces 
Annual Earhart 
Scholarships
The 25th annual Earhart Schol
arships have been announced by 
Zonta International for the 1963 
academic year. The $2,500 grants, 
offered to qualified women for ad
vanced study in aeronautical 
sciences, were established by 
Zonta, an executive womens 
service organization, as a memor
ial to Amelia Earhart. The worldfamous air pioneer was an active 
member of Zonta (her only non
professional affiliation) for many 
years before her disappearance in 
1937 in the initial attempt to fly 
around the earth at the equator.
A bachelors degree in a science 
is the basic requirement for a 
scholarship, plus evidence of ex
ceptional ability and personal 
character. The award may be 
used in any college chosen by the 
candidate and approved by Zontas 
scholarship committee.
Further information about the 
giants can be obtained from 
Zontas headquarters office, 59

P.M. Dr. Kary will conduct the 
Pittsburgh Symphony.
In Tech F. A. Gallery
An exhibition of the work of 
the Pittsburgh architect Frederick
G. Schreiber, Jr. (1872-1958) will 
be held in Gallery I of the De
partment of Fine Arts, Carnegie 
Institute through November 18, 
19J52. It will consist of about fortyfive large photographs (including 
some early views and reproduc
tions of the architects own draw
ings.
The show was organized by 
James D. Van Trump and James
H. Cook, both of the Department 
of Architecture.
Sheibler, the most distinguish
ed Pennsylvania pioneer of mod
em architecture, was born in the 
Oakland district of Pittsburgh. 
Educated in the city schools, he 
received his training in the offices 
of such local architects as Henry 
Moser and Alden and Harlow. 
About 1898, he set up a business 
of his own. From 1905 to 1925 he 
was responsible for a series of 
distinguished buildings. Because 
of increasing blindness, he ceased 
designing some years before his 
death, which occurred at his sub
urban home near Pittsburgh.
Although he never went to Eu
rope, he was familiar with the 
most modern European architec
ture of his time through books and 
magazines. Like Frank Lloyd 
Wright, he was also much influ
enced by the art of Japan. He 
worked mostly in the field of
house and apartment architecture, 
and much of his practice was con
fined to the East End of Pitts
burgh.
His first important building was 
the Old Heidelberg Apartments 
(1905-08 at Braddock Avenue and 
Waverly Street, which was uni
quely modern in Pennsylvania in 
its day. His Highland Towers 
Apartments at 340 South Highland 
Avenue (1913), which is a start
ling building for its time, re
sembles closely the work of Frank 
Lloyd Wright. The Vilsack Row 
houses (1912) at Jancey and 
Martha Streets are so contem
porary that they could well have 
been built in 1962. Sheibler 
the first architect in Pittsburgh to 
be influenced by the English 
garden city movement, and his 
group cottages like Hamilton Cot
tages (1911-14) on Beacon Street 
and Meadocots (1912) on Rosedale Street are fine examples of 
the type. Although his buildings 
are similar to English and Ger
man work, he never copied, but 
always evolved his own original 
designs.
A dedicated artist, he display
ed an intensely practical as well 
as an inventive attitude toward 
design. Pittsburghs only original 
native architect, he reserves a 
place in the historical chronicle 
of American architecture.

Pall Mall PresentsGIRL WATCHER S GUIDE
HORN-RIMMED
BOOKSTACKER
(SMRffllPt!!) WIMI
The Bookstacker serves the cause of classical literature 
in various ways. Perhaps the least of these is in keeping 
the rows of books properly aligned and the jackets free 
of dust.
Her most important contribution is in improving the 
environment for study, enhancing the halls of learning 
with her own classical form. Many a college man has 
discovered a previously unfelt craving for knowledge 
simply because he received his copy of Homer from the 
hand of a deep-breathing redhead who sighed, I think 
Homer is the most! Yes, it pays to take a good look at 
the classics now and then.
Among cigarettes, Pall Mall is a classic famous 
length, fine tobacco ... no flat "filtered-out flavor, no 
dry smoked-out taste. Try Pall Mall and see!
Pall Malis natural mildness 
is so good to your taste!
So smooth, so satisfying, 
so downright smokeable!

Pershing Rifles
Stresses New Activities
Carnegies P/R Company A-5 
is conducting an ambitious re
orientation program shifting 
stress from the military formal
ity to the military functionality 
aspect of training.
The program will emphasize 
the practical application of tactics 
and other military skills. Com
pany A-5 is joining the growing 
number of college military train
ing for the conscientious college 
student.
The company is conducting an 
extensive recruiting program 
which will last throughout the 
month of October. During this 
time, all interested and qualified 
freshnen cadets will be contact
ed through weekly orientation 
programs featuring army train
ing films on Airborne and Ranger 
Training and U.S. Army Special 
Forces units.
The pledges will learn about 
todays modern battle field condi
tions as well as the spit and polish 
aspects of the military. To achieve 
these ends, the Company has set 
up a schedule of weekend tactical 
maneuver, squad and platoon 
tactics, logistics and communi
cations. The Company hopes to 
collaborate with various local 
military organizations in these 
problems. One of the more spec
tacular events planned (early in 
April), by the Company is parti
cipation in a weekend battle 
maneuver with units of the U.S. 
Marine Corps Reserve stationed in 
Pittsburgh. Carnegies P/R ca
dets will apply their training 
under realistic combat conditions 
and further develop their leader
ship skills.
The high point in pledge train
ing this year will be the annual 
Hell Weekend, described by 
army personnel who have wit
nessed the event as one of the 
most comprehensive programs 
testing military skills in the al
lotted time.
This vear. Carnegie will be re
presented by WO Richard Davis, 
1st Sgt. Jack Pevenstein, and Sgt. 
Robert Stone at the national P/R 
Convention to be held in New 
Orleans from 11-14 October. 
Transportation for the trip will 
be courtesy of Uncle Sam. The 
highlight of the convention will 
be a banquet held at the newly 
opened Playboy Club.
Plans this year for trick drill 
competition are a trip to the 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base 
for the nation-wide drill compe
tition and air show. Welcome ad
ditions to the team will be tan 
uniforms, jump boots, and caps. 
Other activities being made avail
able to P-R cadets this year in
clude such things as voluntary 
summer training programs before 
normal summer camp and volun
tary Airbourne Jump training.
Perhaps the greatest benefit 
cadets derive from their experi
ences in the Company is leader
ship training. The technique of 
leadership whether on a parade 
ground or a battlefield is learned 
by practice and not from a book 
in a classroom. Whether at pledge 
training or in command of a squad 
on a field problem, the P-R cadets 
are given a chance to lead.
U.S. Air Force 
Visits Campus 
For Enlistment
A United States Air Force Of
ficer Program Information Team 
will visit the campus on October 
19, 1962. The team will be located 
in the Administration Hall lobby 
between the hours of 9:30 A.M. 
to 2:30 P.M.
There are many programs lead
ing to a commission with in the 
Air Force for which college stu
dents, both men and women, are 
basically qualified. An example is 
the new Offiicer Training Schiol 
which is specifically designed for 
college graduates. This is a co-educational officers program where 
final eligibility can be determined 
without obligation or cost to the 
applicant. You may now apply 
for this program (210) days prior 
to graduation. Team visit is not 
for enlistment purposes, but only 
to inform interested persons of 
the opportunities available to 
them. Please feel free to stop 
and chat.

50 1961 Books 
On Exhibit
An exhibition, Fifty Books of 
the Year: 1961. is on display in 
the foyer of the Hunt Library, 
October 8 through 20. The exhibi
tion is sponsored by the American 
Institute of Graphic Arts, which 
holds an annual competition to se
lect 50 books which show the 
highest standards of design and 
! production. The 1961 selections 
were chosen from over 800 en
tries.
Tech is an appropriate place 
for this exhibition, since a Tech 
faculty member was one of the j 
judges who chose the books, and 
a book published by the Hunt BoI tanical Library was one of those 
! chosen.
The faculty member is Jack W. 
Stauffacher, an assistant professor ; 
of graphic arts and painting, de- ; 
I sign, and sculpture in the Col- !
lege of Fine Arts. Professor Stauf
facher is also the director of the 
New Laboratory Press, Carnegies 
recently-reactivated fine Press. 
He was once proprietor of the 
Greenwood Press in San Fran
cisco. In 1959 two books designed 
by him were chosen by the AIGA 
for an exhibition of the 50 best 
books of the previous ten years.
The Catalog of Botanical Books 
in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt is the book 
published by the Hunt Botanical 
Library. The Botanical Library 
houses Mrs. Hunts world-famous 
collection of botanical books and 
prints.
The exhibition will be open to 
the public during the regular li
brary hours: 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Saturday; 2 to 6 p.m. Sun

To Present Talk
A discussion on the relationship 
of two distinct fields of study will 
be held on Monday, October 22 
at 8:00 in Wherrett Lounge, Skibo. The question of a relationship 
existing between painting and 
physics will be discussed by two 
of Techs prominent faculty mem
bers, Mr. R. E. Beaman, Associate 
Professor of Painting and Design, 
and Dr. S. D. Benedetti, Professor 
of Physics.
Certain discoveries in physics 
during the nineteenth century, and 
the simultaneous trend towards 
impressionistic art have led some
to believe there is a correlation 
between the two. The speakers 
hold opposite opinions on the sub
ject which may prove to be both 
enlightening and amusing.
A discussion and coffee hour, 
sponsored by Mortar Board will 
follow the program.

lations between the development 
of physics and that of art.
Considering Section 1 of the 
exhibit, I certainly agree with the 
idea that the differences between 
works by Duccio and works by 
Tintoretto reflect the difference 
between the mystic concept of the 
Universe prevalent during the 
Middle Ages and the more ra
tional concept accepted during the 
Renaissance. It is also true that 
the discovery of the laws of per
spective (Section 2) and of the 
laws governing light and shade 
(Section 8) have had a deep in
fluence on Renaissance and Baropue painting.
But if we proceed to Section 3 
and 4, we read: finally, more recent painters have returned to the 
flat plane as a symbol of the in
comprehensible, finite yet ex
panding (or pulsating?) space of 
Einsteins astrophysics and El 
Grecos sweeping lines and avoid 
forms bring to mind the elliptical 
orbits Kepler postulated as an im
provement on Brahes cosmology.
I think that no comments are nec
essary.
In Section 5 on* finds the fol
lowing statement: Cubism, be
ginning with pictures by Picasso 
and Braque, illustrates the uenetrability of matter, since space is 
shown breaking through solid 
forms. Like the subatomic parti
cles, charged with positive and 
negative electrical energy, the lit
tle planes in a Cubist work seem 
suspended in space as if balanced 
between electrical attraction and 
repulsion. For anyone who has a 
knowledge of modern physics, 
such statements are ridiculous. If 
there is any resemblence between 
atomic structure and cubist paint
ings. for example, it is obviously 
of such a superficial kind as to 
be of no interest whatever.
Many other statements are 
formulated in such a vague and 
tendencious way that they defy 
analysis. For example: Braques 
method of breaking up objects in
to broad planes of color and as
sembling these in an aesthetic 
pattern, w'hich recalls the original 
object, is parallel to the idea of 
substance as a sequence of experi- j 
ences joined arbitrarily in the ob- I 
servers mind. A new definition j 
of space was necessary to express j 
such a new attitude towards 
forms in upace (Section 3).
To encounter this sort of froth 
in the art column of a popular 
magazine is usual enough. It is 
less usual enough. It is less usual 
to find it displayed on the walls 
of a university.

Skibo Exhibits 
Contrast Art 
Past a nil Present
An exhibition being circulated 
throughout the country by the 
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service is on dis
play at Skibo Gallery from Oc
tober 5 to October 26.
Mr. Grose Evans, Curator of 
the Index of American Design 
and Extension Services, National 
Gallery of Art, conceived and 
prepared the exhibit, which com
pares and contrasts artistic and 
scientific conceptions from the 
Middle Ages to the present day. 
Mr. Evans shows that a parallel 
exists between artists concep
tions of physical phenomena and 
physicists definitions of the same 
feature of 'the natural world. At 
the same time, he contrasts the 
Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, 
and Modern ideas.
Representation of space, weight 
movement, and time by artists 
such as El Greco reflects the 
scientific notions, evolving from 
theories of such physicists as 
Galileo or Newton. The physi
cists knowledge that matter is 
penetrable is also refllected in 
works of Monet and the Neo-Im
pressionists by the disintegrating 
of solid masses. The evolution of 
light and color theories and ex
periments from Newton to Helm
holtz, is paralleled in the history 
of art in paintings by Van Eyck, 
Vermeer, Rembrandt, Monet, 
Gauguin, and others.

Reflections of Telstar
Remember the picture above? It flashed across your 
television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps 
you remember that it originated from France. And 
that it reached the U. S. via Telstar, the worlds first 
private enterprise communications satellite.
. Since that summer night, the Bell Systems Telstar 
has relayed electronic signals of many types-tele
vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs, 
and others.
But theres one Telstar reflection you might have 
missed. Look into the faces of the Bell System people 
below and youll see it. It is the reflection of Telstars
success that glowed brightly on the faces of all who 
shared in the project.
Their engineering, administrative and operations 
skills created Telstar and are bringing its benefits 
down out of the clouds to your living room.
These Bell System people, through their talented, 
dedicated efforts, make your phone service still better, 
more economical, and more useful.
The reflections of Telstar are many.

Tech halfback Jim Black, picks up five yards around left end.
Tech Loses Again, Tartan Scholars 
Crushed by Grove City, 62-0
by John Blue
It was either step aside or be 
trampled Saturday at Grove City, 
and the Carnegie Tech football 
team stepped aside. In doing so 
they allowed the Grovers to score
62 points. Tech's worst defeat 
since 1950 when they were 
swamped by Lehigh 66-0.
Tech was undoubtedly hurt by 
injuries to key men. A rash of 
shoulder injuries plagued the 
team last week, and as a result, 
senior end Larry Arrendas was 
out of play entirely. In addition, 
halfback Furman Smith was play
ing with a heavily bandaged 
shoulder, and quarterback Ken 
Bechtel was not able to go full 
speed due to his injury suffered 
in the Denison game two weeks 
ago.
With the win, Grove City ran 
its record to 2-2. The defeat 
dropped Techs mark to 0-4.
Grovers Dominate
Grove City so completely dom
inated the play that they scored 
every time they got their hands 
on the ball, with one exception. 
This came when the Grovers fum
bled on the Tech 10 yard line, 
after a 44 yard run the play be
fore had put them there. The 
Grovers piled up a total net yard
age of 404 to Techs minus-1. For 
the second time in four games, 
Tech failed to score a first down, 
while the defense allowed 21.
The day and weather was per
fect for the football game and 
Grove Citys homecoming. The 
Tech co-captains were Ken Bech
tel and Don Monti. Grove City 
sent Dodds and Shockey to the 
center of the field. Tech won the 
toss for the first time this year, 
and elected to receive. Had they
kicked off, the final score is likely 
to have been 69-0.
Rout Begins
Grove City kicked off, and on 
the first play of the game Terry 
Hechler reeled off Tech's longest 
gain of the day, an end run that 
netted six yards. Tech promptly 
lost 2 yards in two plays and 
punted. Eight plays later, fresh
man Tom Shear carried 11 yards 
for the TD. Shear, who had car
ried only once before in varsity 
competition, gained 40 yards in 
this drive.
Following the kickoff. Tech lin
ed up in a short punt formation 
and attempted to pass. The for
mation, used for the first time in 
this game, consisted of a tailback 
taking a direct snap from the cen
ter of about five yards and pass
ing to one of the spread ends. Un
fortunately, the formation was to 
no avail, and Tech punted again.
The Grovers took the ball on 
the Tech 41 yard line and scored 
in three plays, the Touchdown 
coming on a 21 yard pass from 
Morrow to end Bill Houston. The 
score after the kick was 13-0.
Tech Punchless 
Tech took the ball on the kickoff and ran it back to their own 
33. Again running from the 
short punt formation Tech tried 
two running plays and an incom
plete pass, and punted on a fourth 
and four situation.
Six plays later, Shear scored his 
second touchdown of the after[continued on page 15]

noon on a 21 yard jaunt. The ser
ies of plays was marked by ex
cellent faking in the backfield by 
the Grovers, and as in the past, 
the entire Tech team falling for 
the fakes. The kick was good and 
the score was 20-0.
On a third down and seven 
yards to go situation, Bechtel lin
ed the team up in the short punt 
formation, dropped back and 
threw a short pass up the middle 
intended for Dappolonia. Don 
Budavich, a first string tackle at 
Pitt before transfering to Grove 
City intercepted at the Tech 42 
and carried it back to the 32.
A series of ten ground plays 
covered the 32 yards to the goal 
line, with senior fullback Sam 
Beckett powering into the end 
zone from the one. The score after 
the kick was 27-0.
The next time Tech got the ball, 
they again tried to pass and this 
one was intercepted by another 
Grove City lineman, Guard Ernie 
Dodds. Five plays later, halfback 
Austin took a screen pass at the
17 and behind blocking that re
sembled a Mack truck, tripped 
gaily into the end zone to make 
the score 33-0. After the kick it 
was 34-0.
one long pass, and fouled two 
running plays, and punted. The 
Grovers third string quarterback, 
Pendergast, threw a flare to their 
fourth string halfback, Hague, and 
he went 54 yards for the score.
Again Tech took the kick, 
couldnt move, and punted. The 
kick was partially blocked and 
plucked out of the air by Joe 
Styduhar. Two plays later Natili 
raced into the end zone from the 
10. The kick was good and the 
score stood 62-0. The game ended
2 plays later, for which Tech could 
be thankful.
Grove City Coach Jack Behring
er suited up 42 men, and 40 of 
them saw action in the game. 
Tech suited 27 and used 25 of 
them.
To F&M
Tech seems to have fallen into 
a habit of playing a good game 
and then playing an atrocious one. 
In the opening game, Tech was 
outstanding in the 7-0 loss to 
Ohio Wesleyan. Then followed the 
39-0 rout at the hands of Denison. 
The team then played perhaps
the best game to date against a 
far superior Waynesburg team, 
only to come back and participate 
in the fiasco Saturday. Hopefully,
a good game will be played 
against Franklin and Marshall 
Saturday.
The team will journey to Lan
caster, next Saturday in hopes of 
getting onto the winning track 
against the Blue and White clad 
diplomats of Coach Woody Sponaugle.

CIT TRACK TEAM 
WHIZZES PAST 
GROVERS, 32-24
by Tom Bednar*
The Carnegie Tech Cross Coun
try team prevented the day at 
Grove City from being a total loss 
as they whipped the Grovers 
Cross Country team last Saturday 
32-24. In marked contrast to the 
football team, who lost while the 
runners won, Tech placed four 
men in the first five finishers, in
cluding the winner Andy Neidra.
The team overcame two ob
stacles in winning the meet. Tech 
was participating without their 
record-breaking runner, Mike 
Campbell, and they were also run 
ning against a group of tough 
Grover freshmen.
The meet started in front of 
the stands packed with Grove City 
old grads there to take in the 
homecoming football game and 
finished in the same spot. At the 
two mile mark, the meet looked 
close, with two grovers in the'first 
four runners. The three mile mark 
found Neidra and Kozlowski bat
tling it out for first place in a 
sterling two man race.
At the finish, Neidra beat out 
Kozlowski by 30 yards to win in 
a time of 23 minutes, 41 seconds. 
Techs Chris Macasco finished a 
strong third, Tom Bednarz placed 
fourth, and Paul Fackler fifth. The 
closeness of the finish is illustrated 
by the interval of only 34 seconds 
between the first and fifth runner.
Following Fackler was a solid 
mass of Grovers, who placed sixth 
through tenth. Rounding out the 
Tech five was Tony Hausner.
Techs undefeated team ran its 
record to 3-0 with the win. This 
Saturday, Tech will travel to 
Geneva to take on the Geneva 
Harriers in a Dual meet.

In Hard Week of Games
Intramural football shifted into 
high gear this past week with a 
full schedule of games being 
played. Most of the league favor
ites did not play each other and 
thus sported unbeaten records 
against weaker opposition.
In the Steelers league, ATO is 
running away out in front with an 
unblemished 3 and 0 record. Ciarameila scored twice and Dave and 
Dan Devos once each in a 30-0 
lashing of TX. A seventeen point 
outburst in the final quarter gave 
the ATO's a 20 to 9 decision over 
Phi Kappa Theta.
The Phi Kaps win came in the 
form of a protested 18-17 squeaker 
over Delta Tau Delta. Albright 
and Klosowski scored for PKT, 
while Scott and Early tallied for 
the Delts.
Theta Xi kept up their perfect 
record by losing to ATO and the 
Browns. The latter game was a
nariow 8-5 victory for the Bro 
who scored seven points in 
final period to pull the game 
of the fire.
