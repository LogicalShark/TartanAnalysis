Pippin, Pippin Called 
Best Collaborative Effort
by Sue Attinson
Ron Strauss, a sophomore in drama, was reading through 
his history book when he came upon the idea for this years 
Scotch n Soda show. Eliminating several historical figures 
and reviving others, he and junior director Lawrence Ste
phens (Steve Schwartz) rewrote the Charlemagne succes
sion drama into a musical which they called Pippin, Pippin. 
Opening this Friday evening 
in Skibo ballroom, the 1967 pro
duction is, according to Steph
ens, more of a strict book show 
than those of previous years.
Musical numbers were included 
to advance the story, he ex
plains. Pippin, Pippin is not 
like earlier shows  music to 
which a play has been added.
Pippin Best S n S
Making what they now call 
their best colaborative effort, 
both authors attempted to pat
tern their music after the tex
ture of the ninth century. They

and kept away from

By means of the chorus, 
which, in Stephens opinion, 
contans the best collection of 
voices he has heard yet in 
S n S productions they try 
to contrast the cool formality 
of court with the warm liveli
ness of the country. Each 
number is written to explain 
some aspect of the plot. Come 
with me where life is free and 
the world is pleasant, peas

the men away in battle what 
becomes of sheep and cattle? 
irate women ask their king.
Stephens wants his actors to 
live on the stage. And they are 
succeeding much more than I 
thought they would, he says.
As to their set and costume 
designers, Stephens and Strauss 
?re pleased, They are giving 
exactly what we asked for.

New Leaders Plan 
Really Good SO
Dale Pes*chel and Tom Moore 
took over the leadership of Stu
dent Government last Wednes
day at a formal installation ban
quet in Skibo Faculty Dining 
Room.
Peschel asked for lots of 
help from the new Student 
Senate members in the audience. 
He said he thought Tech could 
have a really good student 
Government next year; he felt 
the large turnout for the elec
tions showed that people care 
about campus politics. He laud
ed the outgoing regime, and 
promised to carry through the 
work they had started.
Moore Plans Committees
Moore adopted a businesslike 
attitude in his acceptance speech, 
after formally accepting the ga 
vel from ex-Viee President Lloyd 
Patross. He said he was going 
to talk shop a little, then ad
vised the new Senators to read 
the Government Constitution 
and to come to the first Senate 
meeting with definite ideas 
about which committees* they 
want to work on.
Patross and retiring President 
Joe Orens received plaques for 
their past years service to the 
Government.
George K. Brown, Head of 
Student Affairs, and Earle 
Swank, Dean of Student Af
fairs, were on hand at the 
banquet to say a few words 
to the new officers and sen
ators.
Brown said he was willing to 
cooperate with the new Govern
ment, but that it must remain 
independent and run itself, thus 
tacitly indicating his acceptance 
of the validity of the recent pro
tested elections. Healso admon
ished the new Government not 
to spread itself too thin, or 
try to solve a myriad of prob
lems at once, but to decide on 
a few problems you think are 
really important, and see them 
through.
Swank told the Senators that 
one cf the most important parts 
of their job was being able to 
work with people. He also 
warned with a grin, that the 
governmental process is often 
slow.

Measures Sought 
To Ease Parking
A complaint to the city about the new parking meters 
on Forbes Avenue and Schenley Drive and a survey of Car
negie Tech drivers head the plans of the administration for 
dealing with the worsening parking squeeze on Techs campus and surroundings.

tising manager, activities editor, 
Greeks editor, senior editor, and 
sports editor.
Anyone may apply for one 
position or more, should indicate 
on his application interest, ex
perience, actvities on campus,

Tartan Needs 
New Proofreaders
Anyone interested in proof
reading for the Tartan should 
come to the Tartan Office next 
Monday, at 6:30 pm.
The Forbes and Schenley me
ters were installed by the city 
to encourage turnover of parkers and to provide visitors park
ing space. The administration 
will contend, in a report to be 
submitted in several weeks, that 
neither turnover nor space has 
been achieved. Comparison of 
morning and afternoon photo
graphs of the metered areas 
shows that many cars remain in 
their spaces for the entire day, 
and that few spaces are open at 
any given time.
Eight-Hour Limit Sought 
If the meters mut stay, they 
could still be improved on 
Forbes, according to the admin
istration, by raising the time 
limit to eight hours instead of 
the present four. Since these 
meters are used almost solely 
by Tech drivers, it is claimed 
that the university should have 
been consulted about such limits.
The administration emphasizes 
that Carnegie Techs bargaining 
position with the city wall be 
greatly strengthened if students 
write directly to Safety Director 
Craig and others about the park
ing problem here.
Survey Planned 
Consideration of both immedi
ate and long-range problems will 
hinge on a projected survey of 
most of the Tech parking com
munity. By mid-May, faculty, 
staff, and student rates and 
priorities should be decided.
Unique Institute Studies 
Transportation Problems
by Sue Attinson
Transportation problems are the focus at TRI, Carnegie 
Techs Transportation Research Institute, which celebrated 
its first birthday at last weeks Second International Confer
ence on Urban Transportation.
Since its establishment one
year ago with an original $300,-
000 gift from the Richard King 
Mellon Foundation  which do
nated another $700,000 this 
monthTRI has conducted re
search for the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, the Port Author
ity of Allegheny County, and 
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl
vania.
Directed by Dr. James Romauldi and his associate Dr. 
Lester Hoel, both civil engi
neering faculty, the Institute 
employs two fulltime staff mem
bers (Tom Parkinson, research 
engineer, and Richard Hall, re
search economist) but utilizes 
the expertise of faculty and stu
dents from each of Carnegie 
Techs colleges.
Says Hoel, Our approach 
to transportation is based on 
the fundamental premise that 
the field is inter-dsciplnary, 
Solutions must be thought of 
within a systems framework. 
He call TRI unique among 
institutes of its type.
Over the past 12 months TRI 
research studies have included
examination of new track struc^ 
ture designs; research on the 
applicability, cost and commun
ity acceptance of a light weight, 
geometrically flexible transit 
systems; and the design of a 
grid substitute for the conven
tional branching transportation 
network.
Joint Doctorates Planned 
Under a state grant which 
provides for two courses a year 
in systems solutions to com
munity problems, the Institute 
is offering a non-credit urban 
transportation course to profes
sional engineers this spring. 
TRI also plans to develop a pro
gram for joint doctorates in 
transportation since related 
courses are offered in several 
departments, and a number of 
students are already generating 
these from their research.

Techs First Film Appears 
At City Theaters In May
Come Back Baby, Carnegie Techs first feature-length movie, is due for release early 
next month. Drama student David Greene wrote, produced, and directed the film for his 
senior play writing project. -

had to use lots of splices and

Shooting was finished last 
week, and Come Back Baby 
is now in the editing stage. 
Out of five hours of rough foot
age, Greene expects to pull an 
hour-and-a-half to two-hour 
movie.
The title comes from a folk 
blues song by Lightnin Hop
kins. According to an abstract 
of the script, the story deals 
with three young men living

where life stands still as it does 
nowhere short of prison. . . .

he works in the Pitt book 
store, and expects to enter 
night school at Pitt next tri
mester. The role is made for 
Terry, says Greene, It real
ly works.
Other lead players are Marc 
Weishaus and Rick Larsen as 
the other two young men; Bar
bara Teitelbaum as Cals some
time lover, Carrie Di Silva; and 
Colette Bablon as a high school 
girl ravished by Cal.
Cast Includes 60
About 60 other people appear 
in cameo roles, including Tech 
students, Pitt students and Pitts
burgh area residents. (The film 
was shot on location in the 
Soho area of the Hill District, 
end on South Bouquet Street in 
Oakland.)
Professor of Drama Akrim 
Midani, who gave Greene much 
encouragement and moral sup
port, appears in the film as a 
shopkeeper. According to Greene, 
He's great!
Generally, says Greene, 
The quality of the acting . . . 
is very high . . . Ive been 
very pleasantly surprised by 
the performances from peo
ple from departments other 
than drama.
As far as Greene can find out,
Marc Weishaus plays 
a drug addict.
No American college under
graduates have ever produced a 
film of this length. He plans to 
use the film as an audition for 
the UCLA Graduate Film School.
But Come Back Baby will 
also be released publiclyprolifically, in fact. Pittsburgh PostGazette critics Win Fanning and 
Harold V. Cohen will see it at a 
special screening as soon as the 
editing is finished, and Before 
June, it will be seen by mana
gers of several large theaters 
in town, by some people from a 
large film company, and by rep
resentatives of CBS-TV and 
NBC-TV.
Of course, Greene is also ar
ranging showings on the Tech 
campus.
A one-man exhibition of works 
exploring light and its uses in 
art is now on display at the 
Museum of Art, Carnegie Insti
tute, in Gallery K. Artist Irene 
Pasinski, a graduate of Carne
gie Tech (in Industrial Design), 
uses diffraction gratings or mi
croscopic prismatic surfaces 
which break up light into its 
various component colors, to 
create this unique and highly 
individual art form.
Mrs. Pasinski is a native of 
Pittsburgh. After graduation 
from Carnegie Tech, she won 
a Fulbright Fellowship in 1950 
and studied at Ecole de Lou
vre in Paris and the Institut 
dArt Applique a llndustrie. 
In 1956, she returned to the 
United States to establish a 
design consultant firm. She 
has taught in the Paintng and 
Design Department at Car
negie Tech.
Since the mid-19th century, 
scientific evaluation and investi
gation of light and color in paint
ing has increased greatly. Ar
tists also explore the creative 
potential of light through such 
works as those shown in this 
exhibit with its stationary and 
mobile play of light. Mr. Geor-* 
gy Kepes wrote in his catalog 
of Light as a Creative Medium, 
"Only by accepting light as ar
tistically autonomous, as a world 
of art in itself, as plastic stuff 
to be molded, shaped, and form
ed as freely as the clay in which 
sculptors model could artists 
hope to find the looked-for cor
respondence between their new 
scale of experience and their ar
tistic expression of it.
The exhibit, continuing through 
June 4, is open from 10 am to 5 
pm daily and 2 to 5 pm Sun
days.

Senate Approves 
Student Tax Credit
The United States Senate 
has approved by a 53-26 vote 
a plan to provide a federal 
income tax credit of up to 
l $325 for tuition, books and 
fees paid by student in col
leges, universities and other 
post-high school institutions. 
Final enactment of the plan 
probably will depend on the 
decisions made by a SenateHouse o f Representatives 
conference committee.
The tax credit plan was of
fered Friday, April 14, 1967, by 
Senator Abraham Ribicoff, DConn., as an amendment to a 
House-passed bill which would 
restore the investment tax cred
it to businessmen.
Under the amendment of
fered by Ribicoff and accept
ed by the Senate, the tuition 
and fee credit is 75 per cent
> of the first $200 paid, 25 per
cent of the next $300 and 10 
per cent of the next $1,000. 
The credit is subtracted from 
the income tax owed the gov
ernment.
The credit is available to any 
person who pays the tuition. 
Thus, it would be available to 
working students and wives as 
\ well as to parents and other rela
tives. Parents with more than 
one child in college or graduate 
school may get a separate cred
it for each.
Over two-thirds of the bene
fits of thisi amendment would go 
to families earning less than 
$10,000 a year, Ribicoff said. A 
formula reduces the amount of
* the credit available to high brac
ket taxpayers.
Capitol observers said an im
portant part in the final decision 
on the tuition tax credit plan 
will be played by Congressman 
Wilbur D. Nills, D-Ark., chair
man of the House Ways and 
Means Committee. So far, he 
I has taken no public stand on the 
measure which long has been 
opposed by the national Admin
istration.
Tech Physicist 
Wins Fulbright
i # ,
Carnegie Tech scientist 
Richard A. Carrigan, Jr., has 
received a Fulbright grant 
to conduct research in ele
mentary particle physics in 
Hamburg, Germany.
Dr. Carrigan, an assistant pro
fessor of physics, will begin his 
one-year research program in 
) August at the German Electron 
Synchrotron. Project support is 
shared by the Fulbright grant 
and the West German govern
ment.
The professor joined Techs 
faculty in 1961 after receiving 
his Ph.D. in physics at the Uni
versity of Illinois.
I The German Electron Syn
chrotron is operated by the West 
German government for scienti
fic research. It is comparable to 
similar facilities operated by the 
U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion at Cambridge, Mass., and 
Riookhaven, N. Y.
Dr. Carrigan noted that the 
design for the equipment he 
t will be using in Germany is 
based on equipment originally 
created at Brookhaven by a 
group of physicists from Carne
gie Tech and Brookhaven.

Sex on the Swarthmore 
College Campus was among 
the subjects touched on in a 
discussion program aired on 
WRCT last Sunday evening. 
Participating in the program 
were Joe Orens, president 
of Student Government; 
Lloyd Patross, vice - presi
dent; Dale Peschel, presi
dent-elect; and Tom Moore, 
vice-president-elect.
The program, entitled Student 
Government: The Past and the 
Future, dealt with the events 
and accomplishments of this1 
past year as well as what's in 
store for the coming year. All 
the participants agreed that one 
problem central to the involve
ment of students in Student Gov
ernment was communications. 
Tom Moore, commenting on a 
solution, indicated he hopes to 
establish a committee to go out 
and poll student opinion. Accord
ing to Moore, the committee 
would also try to get the accom
plishments and working of Stu
dent Government and the stulent senate, which he heads 
across to the students. All of 
the participants recognized the 
importance of the full use of 
campus communications media 
such as the Tartan and WRCT.
Lloyd Patross felt that one 
of the problems existing' in 
student communications and 
the apparent absence of school 
spirit was the lack of signifi
cant issues to bring to the stu
dents. He mentioned the fact 
that other schools are worry
ing about already solved prob
lems at Tech. He gathered this 
information at a conference 
held recently in Michigan 
which he attended. At the con
ference one of the problems 
facing other student govern
ments was the existance of 
campus newspaper censorship 
by the administration. Speci
fically this problem exists at 
Rice University in Texas. 
Another problem was the exis
tence of a sex rule on the 
Swarthmore Campus. Under 
this rule students are punished 
for anything from light pet
ting to intercourse. The pun
ishment is meted out in the 
form of a term on the grounds 
crew, the terms proportionate 
to the severity of the infringe
ment.
All the participants gave a 
report of their accomplishment 
and their plans and hopes for 
student government. They dealt 
with the various internal com
mittees which insure the smooth 
and successful functioning of 
Student Government.
Finally, all were common in 
their enthusiasm for the begin
ning of Carnegie University next 
fall. Its creation will not only 
add to the challenges facing stu
dent government but also the 
breadth it will create in its
ranks.
Dale Peschel again empha
sized the necessity of student 
interest and involvement in stu
dent government. He asked for 
any students interested in work
ing on student Government to 
get in touch wih him or Tom 
Moore and express their ideas 
as well as their willingness to 
work.

Editorial
Validity Takes 
A Long Time Trying
Now that the officers and delegates of Student Gov
ernment have been officially installed, it is time for them 
to look forward to the problems they will have to face in 
the coming year. Unfortunately, they do not have to look 
far, or forward, to find their problems.
Beginning at the beginning, nominating procedures 
must be revamped. Write-in candidates should be allowed 
at any time, as they are in local, state, and even Presidential 
elections. The only restriction on a write-in candidate should 
be that he fulfill all job qualifications and that he notify the 
Senate Rules Committee of his intentions. The present peti
tion system should, however, be maintained, since this gives 
those who obtain petitions the advantage of an early quasi
campaign, and causes write-ins to suffer hardships at the 
polls according to when they begin their campaigns. Any 
man who fulfills the constitutional requirment by polling 
a plurality of the votes cast should gain the office in ques
tion.
Of course, one method for handling an abundance of 
candidates would be to change the constitutional require
ment so that the president would need a majority of the 
votes cast. This procedure might call for primaries and/or 
a runoff election.
Much should be done to change the voting conditions. 
Voters should have more privacy. Perhaps the city wouM 
let us use its voting machines (we lend them Donner Ha1! 
lobby each year during elections). Otherwise, old-style voting 
booths could be set up. In addition, Student Government 
must pass a definite regulation prohibiting electioneering 
within some reasonable distance ef the polls. Multiple voting 
should not be permitted in the future; neither should voting 
by night-school or graduate students, unless graduate stu
dents might be in some way represented in Senate. In all, 
these measures should protect the voters, the candidates, 
and the Alpha Phi Omega members who would be manning 
the stations.
Other matters may seem tame by comparison, but they 
are still important. Peschel and Moore should attempt to 
have all students on administration committees such as the 
Student Life Committee appointed from the ranks of the 
Senate. This seems logical if Student Government is to be 
a truly active organization directly representing the student 
body to the administration. In order to improve both exist
ing and new-found communications between the administra
tion and the students, a bulletin board should be prominently 
placed in Skibo by Student Government, listing meetings 
to be held (whether administration, faculty, or student), 
topic of the meeting, time, place, and whether open or 
closed. All closed meetings should indicate a place where 
interested persons might send suggestions.
Carrying out ITS role as a communications link, the 
Tartan plans to provide space for the above bulletin board 
information as collected by Student Government and will 
publish a weekly or bi-weekly column by Dale Peschel.
We urge the Senate to seriously consider these pro
posals at the earliest possible date. The validity of the entire 
Student Government system at Tech hangs in the balance.

Good Design Can Be 
A Good Investment
Editor, the Tartan:
During the past year there 
has been much excitement gen
erated by the evolution of Car
negie Tech into Carnegie Uni
versity. This new institution, 
I uilding from the sound base of 
i ech, will, it is hoped, became 
an important island of higher 
ducation. This is possible, but 
not certain. Too much depends 
upon the administration and the 
Board of Trustees.
It is true that they were far
sighted enough tomerge Mellon 
Institute and Carnegie Tech to
gether. But that was the first 
and easiest decision they made 
in the history of C.U. Not to say 
that the logistics of merging the 
two institutions was easy; ad
mittedly the task was monu
mental. However, once the de
cision was made (seemingly pro
posed by the Trustees of Mellon 
Institute, who wanted to keep 
their institution private), the ad
ministration had only to mind
lessly work out the details. I 
use mindlessly because the ad
ministration, and especially the 
Trustees, do not seem to realize 
what they got themselves in
volved in.
The expansion of Tech into
C.U. means the expansion of the 
present physical facilities. This 
has been stressed by the admin
istration and will be C.U.s down
fall unless the administration 
(Trustees!) reverse its building 
policy. Its present policy is ex
pressed by the buildings put up 
during the Ten-year building 
program. These buildings are 
representative of the education
al philosophy that a school needs 
a good curriculum and, secondly, 
structures to shelter it. This 
policy worked well in the past 
when education was taught. 
However, with the present em
phasis on individual learning 
and the scientific equipment 
available to make this possible, 
facilities are no longer second. 
Well-equipped buildings are as 
(if not more) important than 
a good curriculum. This is true 
not only in the sciences but in 
the arts as well.
The first building to be built 
by Carnegie University will be 
the Dramatic Arts Center. This 
complex of buildings (connect
ed with the new WQED studios 
to be built on Tech campus) will 
be an early indication of the 
quality of C.U. If the trustees 
overcome their inhibitions about 
spending money on buildings 
and commission a Center that is 
advanced, if not a leader in its 
field, C.U. has prospects of be
coming a leading university. If, 
however, they allot only enough 
money to build a medicore build
ing, C.U. will be a medicore uni
versity. And finally, if they build 
another building like Skibo, 
which has to be redesigned a 
few years after it is built be
cause it is inefficient and un
comfortable, C. U. has nt a 
chance.
In this half of the Twentieth 
Century, it is buildings that can 
make a university great. Good 
facilities attract excellent facul
ty (from institutions which have 
inferior facilities), which in turn
Student Interest 
Determines Results
by Dale Peschel 
President, Student Government
I was ecstatic at the number of students that voted in the ^ 
Student Government electionsit showed renewed, or even new 
found, enthusiasm in student government. Unfortunately, in cam
paigning I began to see how many students were not interested 
did not know about, or just did not care for student government. 
The voting showed a step in the right direction, however. With 
more interested students, and with more students that are inter
ested, student government will be going farther, and might even 
accomplish some unheard of projects. (What do you think about 
getting some good entertainment like Brubeck or the Momas and 
the Papas for some weekends next year? ?) The administration 
appears to be backing us. Last week at the installation banquet 
Dean Brown stated that the administration would like to see us 
handle our problems from our own level rather than having the 
administration trying to run things for us.
So the stage is set. Enter the student who wants to have 
a hand in producing resultsand we have a successful show!
Or, in other words, this is a formal call for applications for 
the various officers and committee chairmen that the executime branch of Student Government appoints. The openings on 
executive council are Attorney General, Secretary to executive 
council, Treasurer, and the five justices in the Student General i 
Courtthe justices will later choose a Chief Justice from 
among themselves. The committee chairmen that will be ap
pointed are for Homecoming, Spring Carnival, Campus Chest, 
Tech, Academic Affairs, and Food Services committees. The ap
plications should be letters explaining what position you are 
interested in, and something on your qualifications.
There is a lot to do in the coming year, and I think we stu
dents are in a very good position to do what needs to be done for 
ourselves on campus. I hope more of you will let me hear your 
opinions and ideas. Tom Moore is working on this idea of com- ^ 
munication, too, since without it we as student leaders could never 
hope to effectively represent a university student body.

The universities are in a race 
for excellence and they are do
ing it partly through progres
sive building programs. If the 
Trustees of the new Carnegie 
University want to win this 
race they must have an appeal
ing campus. Extra money spent 
on new buildings s a sound and 
respected institutions. Whether 
it matures into an outstanding 
educational center is n the rands 
of the present administration 
and its building policy. Hope
fully it will fully understand 
its burden before it is too late.

M. Marchal is organist for 
the Jenunesse Musicale in Par
is, where he performs on the 
great organ of the Palais de 
\ Chaillot. His frequent record
ings have won many prizes. His 
students may be found in al
most every important American 
musical community.
M. Marchal studied at the 
National Institute for the
Young Blind, where he later 
taught. He was organist at 
the famous church of SaintGermain-desPres from 1915 to 
 1945, and was organist at the
church of Saint-Eustache from 
1945 to 1963.

ridor, TRI will present a new 
concept in track structure to 
the U. S. Department of Com
merce. Eliminating the need for 
wooden ties, rails are mounted 
on a concrete slab which spans 
two narrow slurry-filled trench
es. According to Hoel, this re
sults in ride quality independent 
of the kind of soil over which 
the vehicle moves.
Easy Access System 
The Institute has received a 
years grant under the State 
Higher Education Act of 1965 
to apply the grid pattern 
mathematically developed in a 
doctoral thesis at Tech  to 
transportation in Southwest 
Pennsylvania. In traditional branched transit systems, 
headway doubles each time 
a new branch is added. On a 
grid of independent but connect
ing transportation corridors, a 
traveller could  with only one 
transfer  gain easy access to 
any point within the grid.
TRI has also been given about 
$70,000 to evaluate the effect of 
advertising and promotion on 
bus ridership. Pilot studies of a 
sociological nature will be di
rected by Dr. Alfred Kuehn, 
professor of industrial adminis
tration, GSIA, and involve grad
uate students and TRI research
ers. After a year, recommenda
tions will be presented to the 
Allegheny County Port Author
ity.

once, Tech, vs. Waynesburg, Waynesburg, vs. St. Francis, and St. Francis vs. Tech. CIT 
easily won both of its meets, beating Waynesburg 97-48 and St. Francis 106-39.
Perfect Year Spoiled 
By Strong Winds
by Mike Smolens
The tennis match against rival Bethany on Friday was rained 
out, and the team travelled to Washington, Pa., on Saturday and 
lost a close duel to W&J, 5-4. The match was played in 50 to 70 
mile-per-hour crosswinds and the winds blew the Tartan
In the doubles, Khan and Gor
don (T) lost their first doubles
Tech won these meets in the 
same way it has won other 
meets this year, taking the great 
majority of first places. (Thir
teen out of 17 against Waynes
burg, 14/17 against St. Francis.) 
The times and distances were 
pretty good considering the con
ditions, which were far from 
ideal. The day itself was cool 
and damp and the track was wet 
and soggy, but the worst part of 
the day by far was the wind, 
which blew in very strong gusts 
that were constantly changing 
direction. This heavy wind, 
which at times made it difficult 
to stand up and face it, played 
havoc with discuses and javel
ins, high-jumpers and pole- vaulters, and made it a major chore 
to hold in the proper lane while 
running full speed.
These two meets Saturday 
were Techs first easy victories 
this year, and probably will be 
their last easy wins this sea
son. The high scores for the 
day were: Flynn 30, Aylor 26, 
Sheldon 23%, Brozovec 22%, and 
Batorski 19%.
Techs next meet is Wednes
day, April 26 (today) as the 
Tartans play host to Allegheny 
College. Meet time is 3:30 pm. 
Then Saturday, April 29, Tech 
travels to W&J.

From The Sideline
Fay Previews '67 Season
James A. Janke, Sports Editor
With the arrival of more pleasant (?) weather, the Tartan 
football squad has become entrenched in the Skibo Bowl, dodging 
javelins and distance runners, and preparing for what is hopefully 
another good year beginning in September. Although Joe Gasparella is ill and unable to be present at the workouts, he is ex
pected to be fully recovered by the time the season begins and is 
now directing the workouts from his home. In a Tartan sports in
terview With acting coach Edward Fay, we talked about the men 
who are graduating, prospects for 1967, and the CIT recruiting 
system.
The most important losses on offense are senior co-captains 
Pete Bair and Bill Patula. On defense Paul Beshenick and Fred 
Brown will be hard to replace, but hopefuly someone will be able 
to fill their shoes. Fay thought for a moment and mentioned that 
Denny Morabito and Paul Zugates, both freshmen this past year, 
might be able to handle the two vacant offensive guard positions, 
but he declined to say more about other replacements. Larry Getto 
and Ken Batorski, two iron-like men who played offense and de
fense, both have two years of eligibility remaining, and Rich Bell 
should again prove to be a leading pass receiver for Tom Hubkas 
arm on the offensive attack.
On the subject of recruits, Fay told me that 62 high school 
seniors had been contacted, but to his knowledge only two men 
were coming to Tech for sure. These two are Joe Grazier from 
Montour (Pgh.) High and Terry Bell, Richs younger brother, from 
South Hills Catholic (Pgh.), both of whom played excellent high 
school ball.
The admissions departments policy on financial aid for 
athletes seemed to be acceptable to Fay. This policy is taken 
from President Stovers address to the Carnegie Admissions 
Council in September of 1966, which in effect states that al
though no scholarships as such are given to athletes, they will 
be considered for financial aid on a non-academic basis pro
vided, of course, that the admissions department feels they will 
last here four years.
Fay was optimistic for next season, but he says that the qual
ity of the incoming freshmen must continue to improve and, more 
important, the attitude of the entire campus in general toward 
varsity sports must change. A few good football players on cam
pus, for instance (he mentioned half a dozen names), have not 
even come out for the sport for non-academic or nonsense reasons. 
These men could improve the quality of next years team tremen
dously. But, to repeat, he is still very hopeful for the squad next 
year.

It seems highly improbable that anyone who has done the 
remotest bid of theatre-going could not have seen the Fantasticks 
by now. Up until last Saturday night, I was in that minority. To 
be perfectly blunt it isfantastick. Suggested by Edmund Ros
tands The Romancers, it concerns a boy meets girl, boy loses girl, 
and finally boy gets girl back. This may sound trite but it isnt. 
From hearing about the show for years (it opened in New York 
in May, 1960, and is still running), and being fairly familiar with 
the score I never really realized the timeless beauty it possessed 
until seeing it. Part of the timeless beauty is due to the fact that 
though it is a show about love, there is a marvelous commentary 
on generations, growing-up, and the world in general. The cast is 
as great as the show. Jeff Chandler and Ann Sachs as the boy 
and girl are a treat to watch. They both have the mark of daunt
less professionals. Robert Benson and Marshall Efron as the kids 
fathers are equally good. The Narrator or El Gallo, played by Baker 
Salsbury, and the Old Actor, played to a turn by William Molloy, 
are terrific. I think something should be said about the two smallest 
parts in the show. The Mute (Palmer Deane) and the Man Who 
Dies (Stephen Wyman) may appear to some to be rather thank
less parts. I felt that Mr. Wyman and Mr. Deane brought some of 
the best moments to the show and, by being totally creative and 
intelligent actors, realized what was there.
The book and lyrics are by Tom Jones, and the music is by 
Harvey Schmidt. They have written one of the finest scores in re
cent musical comedy history. Word Baker, who also directed the 
original off-Broadway production, has brought his immense talents 
to this production by directing it here. The New Yorker has said 
almost weekly that The Fantasticks is for those who have a large 
tolerance for whimsey. That may be partially true, but at the same 
time anyone who enjoys great theatre would do well to go down 
to the Pittsburgh Playhouse and see The Fantasticks. It is playing 
nightly except Mondays.

Opening Lead: Spade 10
South thought he might have 
a game in no trump, but did not 
have a convenient rebid over 
two clubs and was also afraid 
of the diamond suit. His bid of 
two diamonds was designed to 
keep the opponents from lead
ing that suit, and when North 
raised the diamonds, South de
cided to gamble on three no 
trump. The Wests lead of the 
spade was taken by the ace and 
declarer led a club to the king 
and a low heart from the dum
my. East rose with the king in 
crder to return a spade, and 
South was in with theking of 
spades. The ace of clubs was 
cashed, and West was given 
the lead with the club jack.
East, meanwhile, figured that 
he had to save his diamonds, so 
he pitched a spade and a heart 
on the two clubs. West could 
have defeated the contract by 
casing his diamonds but, hop
ing for a three trick set, decided 
to set up his spades and wait 
for declarer to lead diamonds. 
East again decided to save his 
diamonds and discarded another 
heart. Now dummys 10 of clubs 
and the ace, queen, and nine of 
hearts were Souths contract 
fulfilling tricks. Both East and 
West had been completely taken 
by South's bid. At the other 
table, normal bidding and a nor
mal defense saw two no trump 
defeated one trick.
