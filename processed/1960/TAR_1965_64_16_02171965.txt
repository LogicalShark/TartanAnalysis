Lost & Found
by John Leise
The Security Office has re
vised the Carnegie Tech lost 
and found system.
Under the new system, foundproperty slips, describing found 
article, are filed in the Security 
Office. The articles themselves are 
tagged and assorted into bins.
Persons reporting missing arti
cles fill out lost-property slips.
The lost and found slips are 
compared daily by the Security 
Officers. When descriptions ap
pear to coincide, call-cards are 
sent to the possible claimants.
Using this new system, the se
curity police returned approxi
mately $900 worth of property in 
January.
Custodians in all campus build
ings have been directed to bring 
lost articles to the Security Office, 
Baker Hall, room 139. Students 
and faculty members should do 
the same.
Articles unclaimed after 90 days 
will be given to Alpha Phi Omega 
who will auction them off at their 
annual rummage sale.

SC Proposes Agenda 
For Spring Semester
by Sue Attinson
Student Congress is already planning several aspects of 
its Spring 1965 agenda. ?
Congress awaits the admini
strations action on the student 
activities budget. It also awaits 
the final decisions of the ad hoc 
calendar committee regarding the 
Penn B calendar.
In an attempt to strengthen the 
financial stability of campus or
ganizations, congress will consider 
a proposal to revise the organiza
tional financial system. The pro
posed plan demands two signa
tures on checks written by stu
dent organizations The signees 
would include the groups busi
ness manager and some member 
of student government.
Congress will also consider pro
posals to install soda machines 
in the classroom buildings, and it 
will attempt to sponsor more 
TGIFs.
The possibilities of sponsoring 
a Morewood Gardens, B-Tower
roof dance will also be discussed.
The orientation committee of 
Student Congress will complete 
its plans for a full semester of 
freshman orientation and the car
nival committee will make final 
preparations for the Spring Car
nival weekend.
In order to inform the student 
body of campus activities, con
gress will erect a campus bulletin 
board. This will probably be 
placed on the Fine Arts lawn or 
near the senior fence.
Student Congress minutes will 
be posted on campus bulletin 
boards.
SC Meeting
Student Congress will meet 
today in the Skibo Ballroom at 
4:30 p.m.

This quick survey shows the horrifying truth of how 
much we as college students know about an international 
situation which could have serious consequences.
Can we afford this ivory tower attitude? Do the college 
walls really protect us from the outside world?
That college students know very little about their 
country and its political circumstance is hardly a joking 
matter when, as today, it is serious enough to significantly 
alter the futures of all. It is time to pay attention to world 
affairs. And it is time not only to know the situation, but 
also to seriously consider its possible effects.
Becoming informed of news events does not require 
many hours of concentrated reading. It does not demand li
brary work or written papers. Reading a weekly news maga
zine, scanning a daily newspaper, or listening to news via 
radio or television gives an adequate amount of informa
tion to push back the wall of oblivion.
Is it too much to require of us to be aware of our 
countrys plight? Shouldnt we possess a knowledge of what 
is making news today to know how it will affect us tomor
row?
How long since you read a newspaper?

Stever Clarifies Views 
On Education At CIT
The following interview with President Stever appeared 
in the Pittsburgh Press last Thursday.
Carnegie Institute of Technology got a scientist with a 
sense of humor when it hired Dr. H. Guyford Stever.
A new college president is sup
posed to look grim during his first 
month in office, but Dr. Stever 
actually seems to be enjoying it.
One of his first projects at 
Tech will be to take some of 
the drudgery out of higher edu
cation.
College tends to dampen a stu
dents enthusiasm, he said, illus
trating his point with the follow
ing story:
When a professor says good 
morning to a class of freshmen 
and sophomores, they say good 
morning to him.
When he says good morning to 
a class of juniors and seniors, they 
just sit there and say nothing.
When he says good morning 
to a class of graduate students, 
they write it down in their note
books.
Dr. Stever, a physicist who 
specialized in missile research 
at Massachusetts of Technology 
(MIT) considers freshmen and 
sophomores the most lively 
and the most rewarding to 
teach.
For this reason, he said, he 
expects no difficulty at Tech in 
getting senior professors to teach 
undergraduates.
Dr. Stever promised in his first 
speech to the faculty Tuesday that 
Tech will re-examine its pro
grams to make sure teaching is not 
being neglected for research.
Today he offered these answers 
to questions from newsmen:
Q.Will there be a great in
crease in the quantity of research 
at Tech?
AIf we got lots more re
search, we could fail to do our 
jobs in other areas.
Q.Do you believe emphasis of 
research to the detriment of teach
ing is a problem nationally?
A.There are places where

The Morewood Crossing: 
Something Should Be Done
Editor, the Tartan:
Youre right! It is time that 
something is done about the ser
ious safety problems involved with 
mere college students crossing the 
dangerous Morewood intersection. 
We would like to suggest a com
prehensive safety program.
This safety program could be 
initiated by a Tuesday assembly 
period address to the student body 
by the well known safety expert 
Donald Dingbat.
At this time we could kick off a 
school-wide safety poster contest

that would keep the safety prob
lem in the minds of the students. 
The winner of the contest will 
serve as captain and representa
tive to Student Congress of the 
newly formed Safety Patrol Boy 
Club whose mission is to guide 
our students across this dangerous 
intersection.
As a final step we could petition 
Mayor Barr to provide our school 
with a highly trained lady cop.
With this program perhaps the

this has gone too far. There is a 
lack of research at some schools 
and too much at others.
Q.Will Tech expand?
A.We can only have limit
ed expansion here. Otherwise, 
wed be like Patton racing 
across France and outrunning 
his supply lines.
Q.How about a year-around 
calendar?
A.I dont like that at all. I 
have no objections to either a 
quarter system or a semester 
system. (He said he doesnt 
like the idea of a student going 
to school without some kind of 
break).
Q.What about the athletic 
program at Tech?
A.I havent had time to look 
into it yet. Athletics can be 
valuable to a school  Notre 
Dame is a good example  but 
a school like Tech cant com
pete on that level.
Q.Do you believe in athletic 
scholarships?
A.I prefer to give scholar
ships for education.
Q.Will Tech co-operate with 
other colleges in research?
A.The best co-operation is 
at the working level, between 
the men doing the research.
He said he thinks it may become 
necessary in the future for a num
ber of colleges to share a jointlyowned computer. In fact, he said, 
a computer may some day be con- j 
sidered a public utility.

Many undergraduates will have read the head
line above, and stopped. Degree candidates in 
electrical or mechanical engineering or other 
technical majorsmen with both confidence 
and abilitywill read this message through, 
and then act. Were looking for those men.
Pennsylvania Transfoi mer is a division of 
McGraw-Edison Company, located in Canonsburg, Pa., 18 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. It 
is an autonomous member of the more than 
forty divisions which comprise the diversified 
McGraw-Edison family.
Pennsylvania Transformer was a highly suc
cessful manufacturer of electrical apparatus for 
the electric utility industry prior to its acquisi
tion by McGraw-Edison in 1952. Its success 
was based on solid product leadership.
In the past several years, PT has expanded 
into a major producer of electrical equipment. 
Entry into new markets, including extra-high 
voltage transmission, assures a sound base for 
this expansion.
Pennsylvania produces a complete line of dis
tribution transformers and regulators, mediumand high-voltage switchgear, and power trans
formers. One of the earliest producers of EHV
transformers, Pennsylvania now has over thirty 
500-kv units in operation or on order.
As a member of the McGraw-Edison group, 
Pennsylvania Transformer has behind it the 
financial strength and stability of a major, 
diversified corporation. Among the well-known 
trademarks of McGraw-Edison are Toast
master, Edison, Lectromelt, Manning-Bowman, Buss fuses and Speed Queen.
But, along with this, Pennsylvania Trans
former is an autonomous operation, where 
decisions are made locally by aggressive young 
management. This means that, while you have 
the profit-sharing plan of a major corporation, 
you work, gain recognition, and advance as an 
individual.
Were not big enough to smother each project 
in depth with engineersthats why we want 
the best.
If you can appreciate the opportunity this 
environment offersnot only now but ten 
years from nowwed like to talk with you. 
Specifically, wed like to talk about design, 
development, application and manufacturing 
engineering; and technical sales. Well be on

Riccardella (32) scores against Western Reserve.
by Tom Terpack
After whipping Western Reserve, 74-63, on Wednesday 
night, Tech dropped its second game of the season to W&J, 
68-62, to run the Tartans record to 4-11, thus ending all hopes 
for a .500 season. Actually, a losing season was assured even 
after the Western Reserve vie
tory George McGeary, continuing 
his great second semester play, 
made only one mistake on Wed
nesday night, but it was a mis
take that will affect Tech through
out the rest of the season. With 
thirty seconds left in the game, 
McGeary had scored on ten of 
thirteen field goal attempts, and 
had pulled down eleven rebounds. 
A sudden maneuver, however, 
sent him sprawling to the floor. 
Although no serious injury was 
apparent at the time, McGeary 
suffered a chipped elbow, which 
will keep him out of action for 
at least four games, and perhaps 
the entire season.
Tech jumped off to a quick 
start against Western Reserve, 
gaining a 7-0 lead in the first 
few minutes. The Redcats man
aged to tie the score three times 
in the first half, but the Tartans, 
led by McGeary and Jeff Kalin, 
went into the locker-room at halftime with a 38-32 lead.
Another quick spurt in the 
second half put Tech into a com
manding 43-32 lead, and Reserve 
never again came closer than five. 
McGeary, who upped his season 
field goal percentage to 68%, led 
the Tech attack with 22 points, 
many of these being lay-ups af
ter beautiful feeds by Hank Werronen. Don Keefer and Jeff Kalin 
also aided with 14 apiece.
Against W&J, sloppy ballhandling on the part of Tech 
determined the outcome of the 
game. The end of the first half 
saw the Tartans tied, 27-27, with 
W&J. The Prexies moved into a 
quick 38-28 lead early in the 
second half, but sophomore sen
sation Ray Burdette, scoring 
twelve points in eight minutes, 
pulled the Tartans to within two, 
48-46. Tech continued to battle 
the favored Prexies until, with 
three minutes left, the count was 
tied, 60-60. At this point, how- j 
ever, Tech lost the ball five 
straight times, and W&J coasted 
to a 68-62 victory. Kalin and
Burdette led Tech with 17 points 
apiece, and freshman Neil House 
contributed 9 for his best effort 
of the season.
Techs only action this week 
will be tomorrow night against 
Waynesburg, defeated earlier in 
the season by the Tartans, 84-76. 
The contest will be staged at 
Skibo Gym, tip-off time at 8:15.

Men Wanted 
For Co-ed 
Ping Pong
In another one of its expending 
moves, the I.M. Board has approv
ed a resolution calling for the 
establishment of co-recreational 
table-tennis. The new sport, to be 
known simply as co-rec tabletennis, will be contested on the 
ping-pong tables at Morewood 
Gardens and at Skibo.
Word has leaked out that a sub
stantial number of male Tech stu
dents are more than willing to 
give up the dull, drab everyday 
routine of going to classes and do
ing homework in favor of the ex
citing life as the partner of a 
Morewood Garden resident in the 
world of a ping and a pong. So 
Morewood Garden residents, the 
rest is up to you.
If youre tired of business law, 
bacilli, etc., then call Venu Chari 
at 682-9290 before Friday the 19th, 
and express your interest in the 
exciting world of table tennis. If 
you have a partner in' mind, fine, 
but even if you dont let Venu 
know of your interest, and give 
some over-burdened engineer the 
chance to face the frustrations of 
calcius and physics knowing that 
somewhere in Morewood Gardens 
a feminine personality is pulling 
for him to succeed, so they can 
win their next co-rec ping-pong 
match.

High scorer for The Rock was

CIT Riflemen Defeat Duquesne; 
Lose Close One To Allegheny
The CIT riflemen lost a close one Saturday to Allegheny 
College after trouncing Duquesne 1410 to 1354 last Wednes
day. Coach John Murphy was very happy with the Du
quesne match because it was the first time in three years 
that the Tartans had broken 1400.------------------------------------------------ -
Leading the scoring was Woody 
Whitlatch with a 288. Freshman 
Howard Graham followed with 
a 285 and Mike Knepley had a 
283. Bob Fritz and Dick Damberg rounded out the scoring 
with 277 and 276 respectively.
These scores naturally raised 
hopes for the Allegheny match.
Allegheny had been shooting 
around 1,400 consistently and a 
win would put the Tartans in 
third place in the league.
Bob Fritz, led the team with 
a 285, including a 92 in the dif
ficult standing position. Mike 
Knepley and Dick Damberg also 
came through, shooting 284 and 
281 respectively. Scott McCormick, 
although below his average lately, 
still managed a respectable 275.
The best the other six shooters 
could manage was Woody Whitlatchs 271. This made the team 
score 1396. Allegheny led with 
1397. Another point by any of 
the Tartans would have won the 
match, because in case of ties the 
team with the highest standing 
scores wins and Tech was su
perior in this regard.
Coach Murphy expressed hope 
that the Tartans could gain re
venge this Saturday, when they 
meet Allegheny and national 
champs West Virginia in a threeway match.
