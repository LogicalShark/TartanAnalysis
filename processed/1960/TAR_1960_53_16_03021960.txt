Price Increases Announced For 
Mens Dormitories In 60-61
There will be a sizeable increase in the cost of living in 
the mens dormitories next year. In a curcular distributed 
to all men living in the dorms, George E. Tipker, Head of 
Mens Housing, announced the approval of the new budget for
1960-61 which includes a boost in#------
sectors of the dorms to keep clean. 
This means general upkeep of the 
room itself, including window 
washing, floor cleaning, and even 
some straightening up  services 
previously performed only ov^r 
holidays.
The reasons for the new policy 
changes are somewhat involved in 
finances. Donner Hall, heretofor 
ltnaintained in the red, had its" 
losses balanced by profits from 
the other dorms. These losses were 
due to the high amortization costs.
But, between last year and this, 
the rise in the cost of operation 
of all the dorms, plus inflation, 
have steadily increased Donners 
deficit while at the same time cut
ting profits from the other dorms. 
As a result, a $10,000 loss is ex
pected by the end of this semester.
UME535NBR E5 16WB 5]
the schedule of dormitory rates.
Those men planning to live in 
the dormitories next year can ex
pect to pay the following yearly 
rates:
fjfOouble suite w/bath ....$350
Single room....................340
Double suite, no bath ... .320
Double room .................. 290
Triple suite w/bath .... 290 
Tripfe suite, no bath ... .270 
These new rates were arrived 
at after a study of mens housing 
in a number of institutions sim
ilar to Carnegie, and are well in 
keeping in line with the other 
schools. -
#rhe figures for fraternity hous
ing have not yet been determined. 
Rates may go up, but if they do, 
they will not be as high as the 
dorms. This differential between 
dormitory and fraternity housing 
partly because of the greater 
)sts incurred by fraternities, and 
partly to attract members living 
in the dorms to the house.
Linen Service 
Carnegie will no longer include 
^?n service in the regular dorm
itory rental either. Instead, stu
dents will be expected to change 
their own linen using linen from 
linen rental concession to be 
modeled after that in Morewood 
Gardens. This includes the resi
dents of Welch Hall  who prevously had full time maid service, 
however, maid service will not be 
discontinued, nor even reduced, 
^aids will instead be assigned
Call Day
Any organization interested 
in making a call or presenting 
an award at Call Day, Spring 
Carnival, May 6, and which 
has not been contacted by the 
Call Day chairman may se
cure a form for this purpose 
at the office of the Dean of 
Students. All forms must be 
completed and submitted to 
Peg Ford, 5B1, Morewood 
Gardens, by March 12.

15-9 B. Ball Season 
Best In 24 Years
By Mike Berman
The Carnegie Tech Tartans finished one of their most 
successful basketball seasons last week with games against 
Pitt, Waynesburg, and Washington & Jefferson in Skibo 
Gym.
The Tartans, stood at 13-8, and 
two wins in the final three games 
were needed to give Tech its 
greatest number of wins since Mel 
Cratsley became head coach in 
1949. The best season "Carnegie 
has had under Cratsley came in 
the 1951-52 season when the Tar
tans won 14 and lost 9. By win
ning their final two games, Tech 
finished 15-9 for the most wins re
corded bf a Tech team ince the 
1935-36 season when it finished 
with a 15-8 record.
The Tartans were on a three 
game winning streak having de
feated Geneva, Slippery Rock and 
St. Vincent in succession since 
losing to Westminster. Andy Komer and Stan Skalka have started 
to rebound and have picked up 
the slack left by the slump of Bill 
Soffa and George Frazier. In ad
dition, Mike Flynn has again 
proven himself the most Valuable 
man on the Tech team bv his
Sorority Rush 
Ends With 
67 Girls Pledging
Following two and a half weeks 
of sorority rush consisting of din
ner, informal parties, and formal 
parties, 67 girls have been pledg
ed to membership in the seven 
sororities. Out of one hundred and 
two girls who signed up to go 
through rush, sixty-six filed bids, 
sixty-two received bids and five 
received open bids.

clutch performances in all three 
of these games, and Ted Williams 
is perhaps-one of the finest sixth 
men in the district. Williams scor
ed 17 points in Techs most recent 
win over St. Vincent, including 
the winning basket with less than 
a minute remaining in the game. 
He hit on eight of eleven shots 
from the field.
Last Victory 
The basketeers from Skiboland 
ended this very, successful season 
by topping W&J Saturday night, 
The 15 wins rocked up by the 
club against only 9 losses equal 
the best team record Mel Cratsley 
has had in his years as Tech's 
coach. It has been truly a success
ful year both for the team as a 
whole and for the individuals 
themselves who comprise this fine 
Tech squad. Not only did the Tech 
reverse last years record, but they 
beat Duquesne twice, which is an 
achievement by itself, and they 
came within an arms length of 
upsetting Penn State and Pitt 
once. As for the individuals, it was 
goo to see Mike Flynn back di
recting traffic, and the discovery 
of freshman George Frazier as a 
fine shooting back courtman was 
an unexpected treat. Stan Skalka 
and Andy Komer did their great 
stints at rebounding and clutch 
shooting while as for Bill Soffa 
the only thing that need be said is 
that he now holds all Tech records 
for shooting and scoring. (He 
established a new season field 
goal record during the game 
against W&J).
Will Miss Skalka 
Fortunately coach Mel Cratsley 
will only be losing one man this 
year via graduation, but even this 
one loss will be tough to replace. 
Co-captain Stan Skalka, who has 
grown to be a favorite among 
Tartan spectators, as witnessed by 
the tremendous standing ovation 
given him at the end of the W&J 
game, js by far one of the better 
rebounders and defense men Tech 
has ever seen. Several times he 
broke the 20 rebounds barrier in 
a game and climbed to as high as 
28 in more than one match. His 
ten-pointminus average this 
year and his over ten-point 
plus" average last year shows how

EAT, DRINK AND BE MARRIED
On a recent tour of seventy million American colleges, I was 
struck by two outstanding facts: first, the great number of 
students who smoke Marlboro, and second, the great number 
f students who are married.
The first phenomenon the vast multitude of Marlboro 
smokerscomes as no surprise for, as everyone knows, the 
college student is an enormously intelligent organism, and what 
could be more intelligent than to smoke Marlboro? After all, 
pleasure is what you smoke for and pleasure is what Marlboro 
deliverspleasure in every puff of that good golden tobacco. 
If you think flavor went out when filters came in  try a 
Marlboro. Light up and see for yourself ...Or, if you like, dont 
light up. Just take a Marlboro, unlighted, and puff a couple of 
times. Get that wonderful flavor? You bet you do! Even with
out lighting you can taste Marlboros excellent filter blend. 
Also you can make your package last practically forever.
Xo, I say, it was not the great number of Marlboro smokers 
that astounded me, it was the great number of married students. 
You may find this hard to believe but latest statistics how that 
at some coeducational colleges The proportion of married under
graduates runs as high as thirty percent! And, what is even 
more startling, fully one-quarter of these marriages have been 
blessed with issue!
Here now is a figure to give you pause! Not that we dont 
all love babies. Of course we do! Babies are pink and fetching 
rascals, given to Winsome noises and droll expressions, and we 
all like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little 
skulls. But just the same, to the young campus couple who are 
parents for the first time the baby is likely to be a source of 
considerable worry. Therefore, let me devote "todays column 
to a few helpful hints on the care of babies.
First of all, we will take up the matter of diet. In the past, 
babies were raised largely on table scraps. This, however, was 
outlawed by the Smoot-Hawley Act, and today babies are fed 
A scientific formula consisting of dextrose, maltose, distilled 
water, evaporated milk and a twist of lemon peel.
After eating, the baby tends to grow sleepy. A lullaby is very 
useful to help it fall asleep. In case you dont know any lulla
bies, make one up. This is not at all difficult. In a lullaby the 
words are unimportant since the baby doesnt understand them 
anyhow. The important thing is the HEN5Rg All you have to do 
is string-together a bunch of nonsense syllables, taking care 
that they make an agreeable sound. For example:
iE 3E H,BB1, *9 ,33,B 50653n
iEEvWEE *EEv*EE 1EEv1EE u50653g
Having fed and serenaded the/baby, arrange it in the position 
for slumber. A baby sleeps l>est on its stomach so place it that 
way in its crib. Then to make sure it will not turn itselt over 
during the night lay a soft but fairly heavy object on its back 
another baby, for instance. c *VO

Film Arts Society To 
Show Oedipus Rex
The Film Arts Society is making 
an exception this week and will 
break tradition in offering Oedi
pus Rex to the general student 
ody Thursday at 1:30 and 3:00 
^*n. in Porter Hall 100.
This filmed version of Sophocles 
tragedy sticks accurately to the 
original script and early presenta
tional methods. Oedipus Rex 
even uses duplications of settings, 
masks, robes, and shoes that were 
used in the plays earliest presen
tation in the Greek Theatre. The 
film is in color and is feature 
length. It was made two years ago 
by the famous Stratford Ontario 
JJhakespearean Festival Players
under th direction E, Tyrone 
Guthrie, one of the worlds fore
most directqrs.
Because Oedipus Rex has only 
limited commercial value, it had a 
relatively insignificant theatrical 
distribution in the United States. 
In that brief time, however, it re
ceived rave notices from the coun
trys foremost literary, drama, and 
movie critics. It is easily one of 
the rare masterpieces of the mod
ern cinema.
This will be the only Film Arts 
program where outsiders will be 
admitted. The special shoeing of

CURTAIN GOING UP!
by George B. Spelvin
Truly A Dream
There are several very strong words that could be hon
estly used to describe the Playhourses current production 
of A Midsummer Nights Dream. One might be the word 
dream itself, another is excellent, and perhaps even 
closer to the truth is superlative.'^----------------------
In short, under Henry Boettchers 
direction, the Craft Avenue stage 
has given us something worthy of 
the man who recently directed on 
it;
Not many of Shakespeares lines 
are passed over lightly  each 
laugh is in its place, and has been 
meticulously calculated by Mr. 
Boettcher to add the right effect. 
Although a little husky for the 
part, Jullian Miller as Puck de
livers each line and each move
ment in a devilish, impish way 
that achieves Puck beyond words. 
The broad slapstick comedy of the 
players near the end of the play 
could have easily been a disas
trous attempt if it hadnt been so 
finely directed. Almost like the 
silent movie comedy days, each 
gag builds to something bigger 
and better, and it ends in a hys
terical climax.
Perfect Settings
Technically, the play is super
ior - far better than the Play
house has presented in the past. 
The forest setting is truly as good 
and as accurate as Shakespeare 
himself could ever hope for. It has 
an out-world atmosphere that 
provides the perfect stage for 
Shakespeares forest creatures; yet 
it also contains the smallest de
tail, as the world of a more mor
tal world might be. The combined 
effect- is beautiful. Some of the 
backdrop effects in this scene, 
give the forest an illusion of 
depth that seems to break the con
finements of the Craft Avenue 
stage. Here is truly a set de
signers dream.
Characteristic of Mr. Boettcher's 
Tech production of the same name 
some twelve years ago, is the com
bination of live action and pup
petry  and the feat has been re
peated for the Playhouse audi
ences. On a stage as large as the 
Craft, it seems a miracle that the 
puppets can look so real or can be 
controlled so well. The only fault 
seems to be that the voices of the 
manikans obviously come from 
behind the wings, thus destroy
ing some of the illusion that might 
have been better achieved on a 
more intimate stage.
Fantistic World
A Midsummer Nights Dream 
is at its best when either the for
est creatures (Puck, Oberon, and 
Titania), or the players are on the 
stage. For here are two fantastic 
and wonderful worlds apart from 
our own. When the real people 
are before us, the play loses some 
of the zip and wonderment cre
ated by the more fantastic beings. 
This could be in part due to the 
fact that we like to see that which 
is unfamiliar and enchanting; but 
it is also due in part to the dif
ferences in acting and direction of 
these scenes. The best perform
ances come from James Goldsmith 
as Oberon, Richard Gallupi as 
Bottom, . and Jack Brown as 
Quince. These are three sterling 
performances, which most cer
tainly accented the groups that 
they represented, made the real 
people, 'by the same token, seem 
less inviting.
The Playhouse has at las* given 
us a truly great and classic pro
duction.' Even though it may . not 
have the commercial potential of 
a lesser play, it will not easily be 
forgotten by those who see it and 
appreciate the wonder Mr. 
Boettcher has opened -to us. There 
is no doubt - Midsummer is 
truly a dream.
Backstage:
Correction! On the Rocks will 
be directed by Scotch n Soda vet
eran, Ed Fredrickson. The musical 
director this year is Dave Stock 
. . . Heddy Bates and Pete Morreau "have the leads in the new 
Playhouse comedy opening March

weeks Film Arts was a dream. 
The rare Chaplin feature shown 
was a triumph. George Diehl at 
piano was excellent as expected, 
and Dave Grebos assisting on per

Editorial
Sorority RushSome Fun
Once again with sorority rush over,. Tech coeds can settle back to the dull, teab 
roles of Morewood girls and commuters. The sailor suits, fish nets, flamirfg displays, and 
tea cups have been tucked away in various cubby-holes on campus for another semester. 
But even more amazing than this spectacle is the astonishing fact that sixty-odd girls have 
made it through the chaos of rushing to find themselves pledged to one of Tech sororitie? 
It is indeed one of the seven wonders of Carnegie Tech that there are any survivors left a 
the end of sorority rush week who are still able to support a pledge pin.:>
Confusion
If one is not already confused about sorority rushing, one or two attempts at reading 
the rules- should do the trick. It seems provision is made so that rushees get to eat the same 
Morewood food (a dubious distinction in itself) along with each of the sororities and then 
undergo a gruelling succession of parties scheduled at all hours of the day and night. 
Heres where the going really gets tough. Taxing and thrilling childrens games of handclapping, rope skipping and paddy cake are played. 0*
Lists
After a couple weeks of this regression, artificiality, and nonsense, sororities and 
rushees alike submit complicated lists of their preferences. This horde of conflicting lists de
scends upon the Dean of Womens office, and the Dean of Women and her assistants go into 
a trance to assign girls to various sororities. It is hoped that the new Tech computer will 
have sufficient capacity to relieve the Dean of Women of this onerous task. Others, how
ever, propose to do away all together with this system of socialism, and favor a return to 
a more primitive rush system. Not to be moved by practical considerations, Pan Hellenic 
Council (the sorority equivalent to CFP but infinitely poorer) continues each year vJ 
adopt the same confused rush system, occasionally adding a few more baffling regula
tions, but leaving intact for the most part this system, known to few, understood by none, 
and violated by most. Some of the more sober thinkers ponder the question of what would 
be left for Pan Hel to do if sororities scrapped this hodgepodge of confussion. But whatever 
the case, one can be certain that the sailor suits, fish nets, flaming displays and tea cups 
will return again next semetser.  J.D.S.
Varsity Track
It is not too late to go out 
for varsity track. Sign up, if

not necessary.

Housing
UME535NBR 0SE* 16WB I]
Meanwhile, the new Hamerschlag Hall behind the hill dorms is 
expected to be pressed into service 
next September as all of the 
dorms along Forbes Street are 
razed in conjunction with the de
velopment program. This new 
dorm will add, to the amortization 
ftsts already incurred by Donner, 
its own and larger costs. Conse
quently, even with the new and 
higher rates, mens housing ex
pects to lose $16,000 in 1960-61.
Forseeably then, mens housing 
needed much more than the rates 
moreases allow, and is actually 
*>n!y cushioning its losses some
what. It could be much worse.
As a college sophomore, youre nearing the mid-point. 
Halfway through collegehalfway through Army ROTC. 
Now you face a major decision: Are the gold bars of a 
Second Lieutenant worth two additional years of study 
in advanced ROTC ?
That question is yours to answer 5Efbefore you 
register for your junior year. As you explore the facts, 
carefully weigh the traditional responsibilities and rewards 
of serving as an Army officer ...
1. Traditional responsibilities. To meet the command responsi
bilities of an Army officer, you apply the leadership prin
ciples absorbed during advanced ROTC training. And your 
executive potential grows as you gather leadership experi
ence. Thats why employers often prefer men who served as 
commissioned officers. These men already have proven 
their capacity to shoulder executive responsibility.
2. Traditional rewards. In every organization, greater respon
sibilities mean greater rewards. Thus the traditional respon
sibilities and prestige of an Army officer are matched by 
material advantages. For example, if you plan to marry 
soon after graduationan officers salary can be a distinct 
advantage. A married 2nd Lieutenant earns a minimnm of 
$355.68 per monthplus substantial fringe benefits. i

Stan has developed his shooting 
ability and shows a tremendous 
improvement over his 3.2 average

will his height and rebounding 
power be missed next year but his

way to replace this sportsman.
Lose To Ritt 
The Tartans got off to a bad 
start against the Fanthers, down 
6-0 before they realized what was 
happening. The Skibos were never 
really in the game during the first 
ten minutes and trailed by as 
many as 11 points through a large 
portion of the period.
Tech was down by 15 (31-16) 
with just three minutes left to go 
when George Frazier got hot and 
scored the last seven straight
points for the Piaiss. He pushed 
through a few more and cut the 
lead to 4 at half time (33-29).
' Frazier didnt let up any in the 
second half and two -quick hoops 
by he and Flynn knotted the score 
at 33-33. Sofias free throw put 
Tech ahead 34-33, but that went 
quickly by the wayside and Tech 
never regainecf the lead. Pitts 
outside men started hitting and 
the Panthers opened up a 12 point 
lead (77-65) with just three min
utes to go. Tech was able to cut 
that lead to 7 at one point (74- 
81) but Pitts fast breaking caught 
Tech off balance and gave them 6 
more points before the buzzer 
sounded. Frazier scored 26 points.
The Tartans, who were suppos
ed to over power the small 
Waynesburg team, just managed 
to squeeze one out over the sur
prisingly tough Yellow Jackets in 
the closing minutes. Tech carved 
a flight lead throughout the game
Then with the score tied AR w 
all and only 45 seconds left in RVB5 
game, Skalka hooped one which 
proved to be the winning basket. 
Tech then got the ball and froze 
it till the final buzzer.
End Season With Wins 
The undersized W&J team prov
ed no match for our fine shooting 
Tech offense. After five minutes 
of play and Tech trailing 9-10, 
Komer hit ^ jump shot which 
gave the Plaids the lead and they

Obelisk Keglers Successfully 
Defended Their Bowlin Title
 . & 
The four top bowling teams in the school, (Obelisk A, 
SAE P, ATO A, and SN A) met in the final round of playoffs 
to determine the IM Bowling champion. In this years com
petition each team bowled one game against each of its op
ponents with total pins determining the winner. It was 
Obelisk A who came from behind after two games to stop 
SAEs bid for its third major trophy this year.

The Obelisks led by Rabatin,
^Doubleday, and Carmichael, who 
were all well in the 500s, rolled 
an 889 series (an average of 178 
per man) against SN A to climax 
the highest team series of the 
year. The 2523 series which they 
rolled, bettered their 2508 series 
in the first week of playoffs, and 
gave them undisputed title of the 
Bowling Team of the Year.

^ The SAEs who were, for the 
*rst time in many years, in the 
running for the bowling title, were 
the only team to win all three 
games, but their pin total of 2499 
was 94 shy of the Obelisk effort.
Going in to the third and final 
game it ~was SAE, Obelisk, and 
ATO, in that order, with SAE 
leading Obelisk by 6 pins and 
ATO by 21 pins. However, in the 
crucial game Obelisk came through 
with a great pin total, while SAE 
Aeld its average, and ATO bowled 
its poorest game of the year. SN 
was hever in the running, for 
while the other teams held or bet
tered their season averages, the 
Sigma Nus suffered a consider
able drop.
This is the third year in row, 
that Obelisk has won the bowl
ing trophy. This fine organization 
enters good teams in practically

JAMES KEATING
Vltlanova University 59
Not at all sure of the area 
of engineering (develop
ment, design, test, manu
facturing) which would 
Interest him most, Jim has 
been most impressed by 
the way Kearfott Project 
Engineers STAY WITH A 
PROJECT from study phase 
right through to produc
tion, assuming full tech
nical and financial respon
sibility for the quality and 
salability (price-wise) of 
the finished hardware. He 
finds that this Kearfott 
philosophy enables, him to 
operate across the broad 
spectrum of engineer
ing.*** Coming from outof-town, Jim was also 
pleasantly surprised by the 
wide choice of living quar
ters readily available.
The very advanced nature 
of many Kearfott projects 
fired this engineers 
imagination. He joined the 
Electronics Systems Lab, 
where he worked on the 
development of a tiny 
counter-part of what Is 
believed to be the most 
accurate test equipment 
yet devised for missile 
guidance systems. Aftef 
exposure to the diversity 
of the projecfs in the Sys
tems Lab, Stan has decided 
to look no further, but re
quested permanent assign
ment here, where work 
ranges over space naviga
tion, digital computers, 
guidance systems, solid 
state physics, Industrial 
automation systems and 
diverse electronic systems.

Len is pleased with his six 
months experience at 
Kearfott on two widely dif
ferent counts. First is the 
combination of both theo
retical and practical know
how he has gained in a 
field that has fascinated 
him for a long time-tran
sistor applications. The 
other is Kearfott's loca
tion. Finding midtown New

planning to continue his. 
studies for an MS at one 
of the many colleges in the 
Newjfork/New Jersey area: 
Columbia, N.Y.U., Stevens, 
Newark College of Engi
neering are all close by. 
This semester, Len has 
enrolled for two Kearfott 
sponsored courses taught 
at the plant.
GARY WOERNER
Newark College 
of Engineering '59
Gary has worked by choice 
in two Laboratories since 
he joined Kearfott last 
June Astronautics and 
Electronics. He values the 
opportunity he had to work 
in direct contact with 
senior engineers and sci
entists who have played a 
leading role in developing 
the Kearfott inertial 
systems and components 
which have been selected 
for application in over 80 
aircraft and 16 major 
missile systems. Gary now 
leans to the choice of a 
permanent assignment in 
the Electronics Lab but 
has decided to work a few 
months in the advanced 
Gyrodynamics Division, be
fore coming to a decision.
Opportunities 
at Kearfott 
are expanding
Long occupying a unique position in 
the fields of electronics and electro
mechanical components and precision 
instrumentation, Kearfott  in recent 
years  has moved more and more into 
the development of complete systems. 
This has lead to major staff expansion 
at all levels, including a sizable num
ber of positions for recent graduates 
in all 4 major company units:
The Systetns Division 
The Gyrodynamics Division 
The Electro-Mechanical Division 
The Precision Component Division
Through its flexible TRAINING 
PROGRAM, Kearfott offers young 
engineers freedom to explore the field, 
before selecting the broad area best 
fulfilling individual interests. 
Remarkable rapid professional 
advancement is possible  and likely 
-through the PROMOTION BY 
MERIT POLICY. For detailed 
information, see the Kearfoti

BSR Retains Water 
Polo Championship
For the second year in a row, Beta Sigma Rho won the 
Water Polo Championship by defeating a spirited Alpha Tau 
Omega team by the score of 2 to 1.
This game was the climax to -------------------
season in which both teams ex
perienced little difficulty in win
ning their respective leagues. The 
Beta Sigs rolled over SN by the 
score of 14 to 0, SAE 16' to 0, and 
ATO B 11 to 1. On the other 
hand, ATO had a little more diffi
culty in winning their games. 
Their scores were 4 to 2 over 
Obelisk, 3 to 2 over BSP B, 5 to
0 over DU, and 8 to 0 over BTP. 
In the semi-finals, each of the 
teams defeated their B teams to 
reach the finals. In the consola
tion game, BSP B defeated ATO 
B 1 to 0 on a goal in the last 
5 seconds of the game.
Final Game
The final game, played before an 
enthusiastic crowd, was scoreless 
during the first period, but ATO 
moved ahead in the second period
1 to 0 on a goal by DeVaux. BSP 
quickly retaliated on a goal by 
Merson. The score remained tied 
until there were only 7 seconds 
left in the game when Alpert of 
BSP scored the tie-breaking goal. 
The game was marked by the ag
gressive swimming of BSPs Andy 
Merson and Jay Alpert, and the 
tight defense of ATOs John Weyer, Charlie DeVaux, and John 
Lemmer. The fine goaltending of 
Norm Ostrau of BSP and Ed 
Frederickson of ATO was also 
evident as shot after shot wras 
blocked.The game was one of the most 
exciting seen on this campus in 
quite a few years. The officiating 
of Pat Crecine certainly helped to 
make it enjoyable for all who 
watched.
Beta Sigs C apture 
Ping Pong, Crown 
For Second Year
This year the Beta Sigs defeated 
the Obelisks in the finals to re
gain the table tennis champion
ship. Last year the same two 
teams met for the crown with 
the Obelisks taking the honor.
Beta Sig reached the final round 
by defeating the Newman Club 
3-0, the Obelisks were handing 
the Tau Delts a 3-1 loss.
Marathon
The championship match went 
the full extent, four singles and 
a doubles match. The marathon 
began with Bruce Wallerstein of 
BSR squeaking by John Tomich 
of the Obelisks in a three game 
match, with the third game score 
being 23-21. The number two men, 
Mort Skirboll of BSR and Howie 
Tureff of the Obelisks played a 
see-saw match with TUreiT win
ning out with a strong third game. 
Then a steady Bill Anderson of 
the Obelisks proceeded to defeat 
favored Mike Rifkin of BSR.
The turning point of the match 
however, was when Andy Merson 
of BSR came through with his 
clutch win over highly regarded 
Carl Carlson. Wallerstein and 
Skirboll, last years doubles 
champs, then defeated Tomich and 
Tureff to erid an exciting table 
tennis final.
Ed. MacEwen Wins Kegling 
Title; May Represent Tech
For the last few week^.the top bowlers at CIT have heen 
enaged in varsity bowling. The top six by average in league 
play were: Dave Harvey (SAE) 184, Ed MacEwen (ATO) 1*76, 
Kent McClean (SN) 174, Bob Reber (SAE) 172, Phil Dowd 
(ATO) 167, Bill Feige (Obelisk),?
164. This is the second year that 
Carnegie Tech has entered a team 
in the National Collegiate Bowling
Tourney.
Team Work
Team, doubles, and singles 
matches were rolled under the su
pervision of our IM department, 
the scores were submitted and are 
to be compared with those of 
some eighty college teams. In the 
team roll-off the Tech bowlers 
showed their stuff by rolling a 
3249 three game series (an aver
age of 180 per man) which was 
200 pins better than the varsity 
team score last year. Outstanding 
in the team effort were Dave Har
vey with a 608 and Bob Reber 
with a 568, although five of the 
six bowlers were in the 500s.
Individuals 
In the doubles rolloff, the bowl
ers couldnt keep up the pace they 
set the first week in team play 
and it is doubtful if their scores 
were high enough to expect even 
a region place. In singles Ed MeBasketball
UME535NBR 0SE* page 7] 
The freshman team, and Cassady finished out the game and 
gave Tech the 74-46 victory.
Ewen rolled a 601 three game se
ries, best of the six entries, and 
good enough to make him the 
likely candidate to represent this 
region and CIT in the National 
Collegiate Bowling Playoffs which 
will be held in Toledo, Ohio dur
ing the world famous ABC Tour
nament. MacEwen rolled series 
of 528, 544, and 601 for a total of 
1673 (this is an average of 186), 
Dave Harvey was runner-up with 
a 182 average. _
Congratulations Ed, we now 
know that if you get the char 4^ 
to represent Tech at Toledo youll 
do a great job.
