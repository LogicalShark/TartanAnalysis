Four Professors 
Receive Annual 
Teaching Awards
Four outstanding educators at 
Tech have been chosen to receive 
the Carnegie Teaching Awards, Dr. 
J. C. Warner announced recently.
The teaching awards were init
iated in 1952 under a grant from 
the Carnegie Corporation of New 
York to stimulate good teaching 
in Carnegies unique plan of pro
fessional education.
Each year, President Warner 
explained, awards are given to 
the four teachers who are most 
outstanding as measured by Car
negies educational objectives, and 
in their influence upon the teach
ing of others.
Recipients of this years Car
negie Teaching Awards are Law

Student Opinion 
Polled To Help 
Plan New Union
Just before finals, about one 
third of the undergraduate stu
dent body answered question
naires concerning a new Student 
Union. They were asked for sug
gestions on the facilities to be 
put into the union .
This student union is still in 
the planning stage, and the date 
of completion is not known, due 
to the finance and planning that 
goes into such a project. The site 
for the Union is on the Cut where 
Web Hall now stands. In square 
footage, it will be one third larger 
than Donner Hall.
Overnight guest accommoda
tions were requested by many of 
the students. Also popular among 
the students was a book and sup
ply store. Some of the other sug
gestions were: a general lounge, 
85%; large ballroom, 79%; music 
listening room, 78%, browsing li
brary, 77%; large theater, 80%; 
small auditorium, 79%, cafeteria, 
80%, and snack bar, 83%. Because 
the union is to be for the students, 
their opinions are quite important. 
What students want will be taken 
into account when the final plans 
are drawn.
Forms have also been sent to 
organizations in order to learn of 
their needs. For example, the sor
orities will have their meeting 
rooms at the new union. When it 
is completed, the Student Union 
will provide facilities for all the 
students on Techs campus.
tion Council. He will address the 
Assembly at 11:30 in the Fine Arts 
Theatre. Everyone is invited to 
attend. . -
Life Magazine last year selected 
Dr. Ferris as one of the 12 most 
able and effective preachers in the 
United States. This selection was 
based upon a poll conducted among 
ministers, priests, and theological 
schools of all faiths. This acclaim 
for the 45 year old minister placed 
him alongside men like Bishop 
Fulton J. Sheen, Dr. Robert J. 
McCracken of Riverside Church in 
New York, Dr. George Buttrick of 
Harvard, Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver 
of Cleveland, and Dr. Ralph W. 
Sockman of New York. The church 
which he serves is situated in Bos
tons Back Bay area and has a long 
and illustrious history.
Part of Illustrious Tradition 
Among his predecessors have 
been the Right Rev. Henry Knox 
Sherill, the present presiding 
Bishop of the Episcopal Church, 
and the Right Rev. Phillips Brooks, 
one of the outstanding preachers 
in American church history.
In addition to preaching in Bos
ton since 1942, he is also an au
thor, scholar, and teacher. He has 
written several books, and a com
mentary of the Book of Acts in 
the new Interpreters Bible. At 
the Episcopal Theological Semi
nary in Cambridge, Massachu
setts, he is a special instructor, in 
preaching. He is an accomplished 
pianist and has written music for 
the Episcopa' hymnal. He is com
ing to Pittsburgh to lead a three 
day mission at St. Stephens Epis
copal Church in Sewickley.

Carnegie Tech Science
President Warner announced last week that effective July 1, 
1956, instruction in chemistry, mathematics, and physics for MMCC 
students will be transferred to the appropriate departments in the 
College of Engineering and Science.

Copp As Editor 
Of Carnegie Scot
At the recent elections held by 
the Scot staff, Richard Oden was 
elected editor-in-chief for the 
coming year. Dick is a junior P
& D, and has served on the -art 
staff of the Scot for three years, 
being art editor this year. His se
lection as editor marks the third 
consecutive year during which 
the Scot editor has been a P & D 
student.
It has not been revealed exact
ly why the editorial elections were 
held unusually early this year, but 
perhaps it was in order to get 
the jump on the other publications. 
Another possibilty is that the 
present staff broke down under too 
much derisive criticism and got 
out while the getting was good. 
The retiring editor, Carolyn Copp, 
insists the reason was merely to 
break in the new staff early, but 
this is obviously an excuse of 
some sort.
The new managing editor is 
Carl Arendt, a sophomore physic

be renamed the department of bi
ological sciences and will provide 
instruction ni biology not only to 
MMCC students, but also to any 
E&S and other students who may 
desire to take elective subjects in 
that field.
This new policy came about as a 
result of the recommendations of 
the subcommittee on science in 
MMCC headed by Professor F. D. 
Rossini, head of the department 
of chemistry in E & S, and acting 
head of the department of science 
in MMCC. This committee of eight 
members studied the relationship 
of the instructional programs of
fered by the science department 
of Margaret Morrison to the cor
responding programs in Engineer
ing and Science.
One Science Department
The two-fold basis for their rec
ommendation was: (1^ MMCrC
science faculty members would 
benefit from daily association with 
a group of colleagues in the same 
field, and (2) instruction and de
grees in each of these three sci
ences would be offered by one 
department rather than two.
All MMCC faculty members 
who are affected will become 
members of the appropriate de
partments in E & S. These in
structors will thus become mem
bers of a large group all of which 
are specialists in one field. Under 
this plan, the departments of 
chemistry, math, and physics will 
be solely responsible for the in
struction of all such courses of
fered on campus.
At present, the department of 
science in MMCC offers a total 
of 39 courses in four sciences, and 
this total greatly exceeds the 
number of courses offered in most 
other departments on campus. 
Under the new arrangement, the 
department of biological sciences 
will have responsibility for 16 
courses, all in its own science.
Uniformity of Curricula
From an administrative view
point, an advantage will be gain
ed from the fact that the course 
leading to a B.S. in chemistry, 
physics, or math will now be uni
form. Formerly, these curricula 
were subject to a great deal of 
variance, ranging from the straight 
E&S curriculum to the straight 
MMCC curriculum. Now, women

64 New Students 
Enroll At Tech
Registration for the spring se
mester showed 64 new students 
enrolling in the various colleges 
at Tech. This number includes 
graduates, transfer students, and 
transfers from one department of 
Tech to another. E. & S. had the 
largest increase in enrollment 
with about 40, half of whom en
tered mechanical engineering and 
metallurgy; Margaret Morrison 
took in 10 and Fine Arts 12. Nine 
of the trar*J^rs are graduate stu
dents and most of the others are 
classified as specials.
33 of the 64 students are com-i 
muters, six transfers are living at 
Morewood Gardens and the others 
are in the mens dorms or the fra
ternity houses. The women' dorm 
now has about 420 residents

Summer In Europe 
For Carnegie Students
The YMCA at Carnegie Tech has just completed arrangements 
to sponsor a music, drama and fine arts traveling seminar in Europe 
for Carnegie Tech students next summer. The traveling seminar will 
be under the leadership of Dr. Norman Dawes, associate professor 
of history, and one other person,?-----------------------------------------------
yet to be named. An advisory 
committee for the traveling semi
nar has assisted the Y.M.C.A. in 
making arrangements. This com
mittee made up of faculty mem
bers in the College of Fine Arts 
includes: Prof. Elizabeth Kimber
ly, Prof. Roland Leich, Prof. Max
well Mayo, Prof. Robert Burdett, 
Prof. Richard Beaman, and Prof. 
Dawes.
The seminar will leave from 
New York City for London on July
6, and return from Europe on 
August 25. Transatlantic travel, 
in both directions, will be aboard 
a special flight of a regularly 
scheduled world airline, and will 
be in company with traveling sem
inars from Penn State and West 
Virginia University. The seminar 
will visit England, France, Italy, 
Austria, Germany, Holland, and 
Scotland.
Will Meet Prominent Europeans
The seminar is intended to give 
students an opportunity to see 
some of the great European mas
terpieces of painting, sculpture, 
and architecture, and to attend 
some of the great music festivals 
and dramatic productions that 
take place there each summer. Ar
rangements are being made for 
lectures by informal conversations 
with British and European per
sonalities prominent in the field 
of music, drama, and the fine arts.
It is hoped that this seminar 
will contribute to the students un
derstanding of the role played by 
the Christian Church and Juda
ism in the development of West
ern culture; and that it will de
velop an appreciation for the re
ligious dimensions, whether im
plicit or explicit, of much of the 
classical and contemporary art, 
drama, and music.
Open to All
The present itinerary includes 
performances of the Glyndebourne 
Opera, the Shakespeare Memorial 
Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon, the 
Cheltenham Festival of Contemp
orary British Music, the Aix-enProvence Music Festival, the Caraialla in Rome, the Salzburg Mo
zart Bicentenary Festival, the 
Bayreuth Wagner Festival, and the 
Edinburgh International Festival 
of Drama and Music. Adequate 
time will be arranged in London, 
Paris, Chartres, Rome, Florence, 
Venice, and Amsterdam to visit 
architectural masterpieces and art 
galleries, as well as some of the 
usual tourist attractions.
The seminar is open to all stu
dents at Carnegie Tech, although 
preference will be given to upperclass students (sophomores, 
juniors, and seniors) in the Col
lege of Fine Arts. Twenty-five is 
the maximum number of partici
pants which can be accepted. The 
total cost, excluding personal in
cidentals, will be approximately 
$940.00. This covers travel, food, 
hotel accomodations, sight-seeing 
and excursions, and good tickets 
to all itemized Festival events. 
Applications may be made im
mediately by contacting the YMCA 
office in the Carnegie Union. Reg
istration will close in early March.
There will be a meeting to dis
cuss the fine arts traveling semi
nar and to answer questions re
lated to it on Thursday, February 
9, at 11:30 a.m. in Room 107 CFA.
Carnegie Panel 
Of Americans Hits 
US Intolerance
In a community where many 
races and religions are found, in
tolerance and discrimination are 
a danger to the peace and wel
fare. The Panel of Americans at 
Tech is working to decrease intol
erance by sending out panels tc 
local organizations. Each panel 
consists of a first-generation 
American, a Negro, Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jew who present 
their own experiences and views 
concerning prejudice and answer 
questions of the audience on mat
ters of custom or opinion. The 
panels are moderated by' a faculty 
member who introduces the 
group; Mr. Fenton, Mrs. Meyerson, Mr. Steinberg, Mr. Strick, 
and Mr. Sochataff are faculty 
moderators. The panelists meet 
together to discuss the problems 
of group tensions and often bring 
in speakers.
The first Panel of Americans 
was organized at UCLA during 
World War II when intolerance 
toward certain minority groups 
such as the Japanese-Americans 
was especially bitter on the West 
Coast. Since then Panels have 
been organized in colleges across 
the country, and Tech organized 
its chapter in 1951. The activities 
of the Panel are directed by its 
Student Manager, Rudy Ligtvoet.
The Panel is working to de
crease the tensions and misunderstnding among the various groups 
found in the Pittsburgh area by 
giving the public a chance to 
meet and question panel mem
bers from the various races and 
religions.

Research Agencies
Dynamic response to shock and

bomb blasts was the major theme 
at Techs 17th Research Confer
ence, Friday, February 3.
The entire department of civil 
engineering has been active in re
search projects aimed at testing 
materials and structures under 
dynamic forces and each member 
of the faculty addressed the busi
ness, industrial, and government 
representatives attending the con
ference from all over the country.
Industrial groups, public agen
cies, and individuals contributed 
to support projects reported in the 
conference, among them the Rail 
Steel Bar Association, the Asso
ciation of Iron and Steel Engi
neers, the Roll Manufacturers In
stitute and agencies of the U. S. 
Department of Defense.
The all-day program dealt with 
dynamic response of such mate

concrete beams, titanium, iron 
work rolls, and floating structures.

Mr. Burreys career at Carnegie 
began when he was 15 years old, 
just three months after the first 
class entered the new Carnegie 
Technical Schools as the insti
tution was then called. He started 
as stenographer and bookkeeper 
in the cashierss office when tui
tion ranged frqm five dollars tdr 
thirty dollars per year.
Originally, he recalls, An
drew Carnegie founded the institu
tion for the sons and daughters of 
Pittsburgh millworkers as a school 
for the development of the head 
and hands. Mr. Carnegie, he says, 
was the essence of democracy. 
Mr. Burrey is proud of his pa*t 
in helping Carnegie Tech grow 
from a one-building school fo?^ 
industrial arts, plumbing, sheer 
metal and printing, to its present 
stature among the nations top 
educational institutions compris
ing seven major colleges and divi
sions.
Among his aged records are the 
weekly payrolls he kept for the 
years 1906 and 07. The record 
shows that Charles E. Wilson, now 
Secretary of Defense, was paid 
fifty cents an hour for markii^j 
papers at Carnegie Tech.
After retirement, Mr. Burrey 
and his wife, both native Pitts
burghers, will move to Oakland, 
New Jersey. He wants to follow 
a growing interest in the out-ofdoors. Married thirty years, the 
Burreys have two children, John

Reflection of An Age
All provide a delightful re
flection of early Victorian life: the 
love of nature in all its moods and 
changes; the newly-founded Amer
ican spas, Niagara Falls and New
port; the romantic appeal of far
away places such as Naples and 
Sorrento; classical literature and 
the work of the New York poets 
and novelists, and, above all, the 
people, the homes, the scenes from 
everyday American life in the 
early Nineteenth Century.
In the Gallery of Contemporary 
Art on the third floor, an exhibi
tion of paintings obtained by Car
negie Institute from the 1955 
Pittsburgh International is on

Bazlotes, Renato Birolli, Lawrence 
Calcagno, Doucet, Roger Dudant, 
Marjorie Elkind, Willem de Koonig, Alfred Manessier, MarciaRelli, Carl-Henning Pedersen, Tom 
Rowlands, William Scott, Sugai, 
Vasarely, Dan Wingren and Zao 
Wou-Ki are included. The show 
will continue indefinitely.
In Gallery J on the third floor, 
the complete set of engravings 
from The Book of Job by Wil
liam Blake (1757-1827) Englands 
great mystic poet-artist, are being

The Jest is a swashbuckling ad
venture thriller set in the lavish 
period of the Italian Renaissance.
The action of the play takes 
place in Florence, at the height 
of the Medici rule and concerns 
the story of a young artist who

The Foreign Film Society con
tinues its policy of introducing 
Pittsburgh premieres. The magni
ficent French film, lAtalante 
directed by the uniquely distin
guishable Jean Vigo, explores the 
sweetness, tartness, the pain and 
beauty of the two loves with 
which most people must ultimately 
reckon, will be shown Sunday 
evening; February 5 at 8:15 p.m. 
in the auditorium of the YM& 
WHA, 315 S. Bellefield Avenue in

night, February 10. This program 
will be held at Syria Mosque, and 
will be given only the one time. 
Associate Conductor Karl Kritz, 
who is guiding the last of the reg
ular concerts to be performed 
prior to William Steinbergs re
turn, will collaborate with Zabaleta on this fifteenth concert of 
the season.
The Concerto for Harp and Or
chestra by French composer Ger
maine Tailleferre will be Zabaletas contribution to this concert, 
and it will also be a first hearing 
of this contemporary work in the 
Steel City area. Other music on 
the program will be the Oxford 
Symphony No. 92 of Haydn,

A new experience for Pitts
burghers will be Nicanor Zabaleta, 
Spanish-born harp virtuoso who 
is appearing with the Pittsburgh
Nicanor Zabaleta
Harpist With Symphony
Moussorgskys A Night on Bald 
Mountain, and Dvoraks Symphony 
No. 2 in D Minor.
Curiously enough, the harp is a 
rather seldom-heard solo instru
ment, especially with* an orches
tral setting for its accompaniment. 
As a young musician at the age of 
nine, Nicanor Zabaleta set out on 
his career as a concert harpist to 
bring the harp before a wider au
dience. His first successes were 
achieved in France and Spain, the 
two countries where he lived and 
studied as a youth. From those 
first conquests, he progressed to 
the concert halls of all Europe, 
and soon was making appearances 
in South America, as well.
Music Especially for Zabaleta 
Germaine Tailleferre, who is 
known most widely for the part 
she played in the activities of a 
group of French music students 
called The Six, has written her 
Concerto for Harp and Orchestra 
especially for Zabaleta; perform
ances of the work have baen high
ly appreciated in many of the 
worlds concert halls. Zabaleta has 
also been instrumental in the re

Editorial
Tartan Ideas 
On Criticism
OnJJau ry1 ,1 tyrhefby Dick Bibler
So we havent done anything at all yet 
this year? Editorials on nothing but feeble 
subjects, and even at that, mostly the com
plimentary type, as opposed to the complain
ing variety, which are much more interest
ing. News which isnt news and features 
which arent worth featuring; not enough 
sports coverage and a dull night school page.
These are a few of the annual complaints 
aimed against the Tartan which accumulate 
into one huge snarl about this time of year, 
when no one particularly relishes the thought 
of diving enthusiastically into second semes
ter work, but when everyone seems extra
ordinarily capable of criticism. The remaind
er of this column, and part of the next, if 
necessary, will be devoted to the defense of 
our stand and our staff.
If the first complaint is justified, we think 
the reason is the lack of sufficient justifica
tion for derisive criticism by us. The blame 
for the other criticisms of us can be traced 
in a not too roundabout manner to a general
student aversion to participation on the________________
Tartan staff. (This aversion to participation in activities is 
certainly not a unique complaint, and is one thing which 
characterizes the whole atmosphere here.)
Our editorial criticism has been directed toward differ
ent areas and away from the traditional topics. We have 
been emphasizing closer integration of the colleges, among 
other things, and it is satisfying to see that MMCC science 
has been transferred to E & S. This proves that the ad
ministration has been concerned with this unification also.
Of course, we could again drag through the fire the 
same old complaints, some of which are even more prevalent 
than previously. Skibo still features many inedible delica
cies at impossible prices, and served in the delightful at
mosphere of an ivy-covered airplane hangar. The check 
cashing service of the Cashiers Office is still highlighted by 
short hours and long lines. The Bookstore and the drug
store still exert a stranglehold on the school supplies market. 
Student Council has carried on admirably in the traditional 
inert and inept manner prescribed by its forerunners.
But with the progression of plans for a new union and 
plans for a new Council, it seems as though some of these 
conditions and others may soon be alleviated. There is 
therefore nothing to be gained by complaining about them 
any more.
As for the second excuse, we think our news and feafeatures are about the best we can offer, but we could use 
more sportswriters and office workers. It is unfortunate that 
the staff of Tartan reporters is huge and the staff of office 
workers is minute. Those who now work as typists, 
copy readers, and layout men are so few in number that 
they cannot be expected to sacrifice life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of a high factor for the sake of the Tartan, (at least 
not every week). We need such a rare species of typists and 
copy readers, that is, they must be willing to work on part 
of Friday evening or Sunday afternoon, that we never get 
enough help.
As for the Plaid, there is practically no interest shown 
at all, and the staff members (both of them) cannot be 
blamed for feeling a little bit discuoraged. So, as always, 
we ignore indiscriminate criticism as long as these condi
tions exist.
HEY. BOLIVAR-'JVF FOUNP ANOTHER SPECIMEN."
Notas De Un Oyente
By Luis de la Maeorra
As many of us have noticed by now, ski
ing has received long overdue credit from 
the students, of Tech. It has by now been 
acknowledged as the king of winter sports. 
This may be verified by the large number of 
students found every weekend in such places 
as Seven Springs and Laurel Mountains. For 
example, last Saturday I counted at least 25 
skiing fans from Tech up at Seven Springs. 
Some of them were experts, some beginners, 
but they all experienced that thrill of flying 
down the white slopes on a pair of wooden 
wings.
I have good news for the people that have 
been waiting for WRCT to give away free 
cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes. Night 
Train will start this traditional feature this 
week. Speaking of WRCT, congratulations 
are due for their Special Programs staff. 
They are organizing a series of programs in 
which they hope to bring to their listeners 
the fine music which is produced by members 
of the faculty and student body alike. The 
first program of this series will be a record
ing of the faculty recital given last Novem
ber. It is scheduled to go on the air this 
Sunday at 6:15 p.m. They are also organiz
ing a new program, The Record Collector, 
during which students will play favorite 
pieces from their own record collections. If 
you would like to take part in this program 
see Tim Day in room 313 Donner Hall . . .
For those people that like my friendly 
competitors column Over The Skibo Table, 
I have news that might be of interest. Be
ginning this Wednesday, at 11:05 p.m. he will 
have his own program on WRCT, called 
Auditor. It promises to be great. Good 
luck, Joe. Hasta la vista and buena suerte.

Over The Skibo Table
By Joseph A. Szewc 
Basketball coach Mel Cratsley recently 
notified me of a letter he wrote to Hot Rod 
Hundley and the West Virginia basketball 
team after our victory here on January 11. 
This letter is repeated below in its entirety.* * S*
Dear Mr. Hundley,
Just today I learned of the very uncouth 
behavior of about eight or ten of our students 
at the Tech-West Virginia basketball gan?| 
in Pittsburgh. I would like to apologize for 
myself, our basketball team and the 1200-1400 
other students who were there and who are 
thoroughly ^ashamed and disgusted with the 
actions of these few. I am referring specifi
cally to the name-calling which occurred at 
half-time before my team came up from the 
dressing room.
When we travel to other schools, we hop^ 
to be treated as guests of that school. Con
versely we should treat visitors with respect 
at our gymnasium.
This is, to the best of my knowledge, the 
first such incident at Carnegie Tech, and I 
mean to be certain it doesnt happen again. 
There is always, of course, a Certain amount 
of riding of a star player of the visiting 
team, but it should never reach the stage t 
did on Wednesday night.
Its too bad the remainder of the stu
dent body and our school has to be judged 
on the performance of 8 or 10 individuals 
with a warped sense-of-humor. Believe me, 
the other 1790 people present have only re
spect for the basketball ability of you and 
your team-mates.
We feel we were very fortunate in whi
ningwe could even say lucky. We hope 
you accept this apology in the good faith in 
which it is made, and wish you every suc
cess in the future.
Sincerely yours,
F. M. Cratsley.

Won Two And Lost One
The Tartans won their third straight meet of the year by de
feating the Westminster Titans 58-25.
The Tartans won all but one first, among which were two im
pressive wins by freestyler Mike Litch who missed setting new pool
records in the 50 by only .4 sec.< 
and by only .5 sec. in the 100, 
turning in times of 24.4 and 55.4 
sec. respectively in the two 
events. Also coming up with im
pressive victories were Dave Har
rington in the 200 yard individual 
medley and Tony Chamay in the 
200 yard freestyle. Among the 
freshmen turning in fine performHe received his BA degree in 
1930.
Coached at Shadyside
After graduation from Tech, 
Harpster still had the game of 
football in his blood and so he 
took a coaching job at Pitts
burghs Shadyside Academy. 
After one year at Shadyside, he 
moved on to Geneva where he 
was head coach for two years. 
With the resignation of Techs 
head coach in 1933, Harpster was 
offered and accepted the head 
coaching position.
His three years as coach of the 
Tartan eleven were very success
ful and he managed to lead the 
Tartans to its third victory over 
the fighting Irish by a score of
7-0.
While at Tech, Harpster was a 
member of the following organi
zations; Druid, Dragon, Delta 
Skull and Kappa Sigma.
ances were backstroker Jim Long, 
breaststroker Bob Terringer, free

Tartans Split Pa ir
The Tartans of Carnegie Tech started out the second school 
semester with a close loss to the Pitt Panthers by a score of 78-76. 
In the beginning of the game, the group in attendance was be
ginning to wonder if they were going to see as thrilling a game
gas the Tartans upset of West Vir-# 
gjinia. The Panthers took an early 
lead in the game, and it seemed 
that they were going to make an 
easy game of the expected hot 
contest. The half time score indi
cated that the Panthers were hav
ing very little trouble with their 
Forbes Street rivals, as they lead 
by the undisputed score of 45 to 29.
Tech Fights Back
However, the Tartan quintet was 
vJiot to be dismissed that easily. 
T?he second half proved to be a 
real rough and tough, thrilling 
type of basketball game. Tech had 
three men leave the game in the 
second half via the personal foul 
route. Mocker, Frank, and Sobolewski were benched for the Tar
tans while the Panthers suffered 
only one dismissal. Pitts Panthers 
had a total of twenty-one personal 
fouls, and the Tartans had twentyl*three, which indicates the boys 
^were really scrapping under the 
boards.
Adding to the excitement was a 
foulup in scoring, Sobolewski re
ceiving credit for a second half 
free throw which he had missed 
for the Tartans. This came about 
seven minutes after the period had 
started, but with the fighting spirit 
that the Tartans displayed, it 
might have been the deciding fac
tor.
9 Frank Gets 19
Techs quintet really caught fire 
in the second half, and it seemed 
that almost everything that they 
did was golden. The plays were 
clicking, and our spirit was high. 
Alan Frank led the Skibos with 
a total of nineteen points for the 
nights work. Ralph Mocker cash
ed in with sixteen points to be
come the second highest Tech 
scorer. Tech had four men in the 
Jteouble figures which indicates 
some pretty fair team work.
This game was the first in a 
two game series, and the Skibos 
will have a chance to even the 
score on their own home floor 
when they once again meet the 
Panthers February 21. The Pan
thers took to ireezing the ball too
early in the final  eriod, and the 
result was that they failed to chalk 
up a fielder in the last three min
utes of play. The final decision 
was made at the free throw line by 
Julius Pegues who dropped in

Tech vs Dickinson
Lead by Alan Frank who signed 
in with 22 points, the Skibo quin
tet added another victory to their 
record with a decisive 93 to 53 rout 
of Dickinson College.
The Tartans had control of the 
game from the opening seconds 
and by the middle of the second 
half they had doubled the score 
against the boys from Carlisle who 
were able to make only 27% of 
their shots from the field.
Dick Fieler opened the game for 
the Tartans by sinking a long set 
shot but the Red Devils tied it up 
with a side shot. Dickinson went 
ahead for the only time in the 
game with a layup, and then 
Mocker and Boyd poured through 
a couple to once again put the 
Tartans out in front and this is 
where they stayed until the final 
gun.
Tech completely outclassed their 
rivals with greater speed and ac

Old Tech Star 
In Hall Of Fame
Howard Harpster, ace quarter
back of the Carnegie Tech Tar
tans from 1926 to 28, was elected 
to the Hall of Fame this past 
January seventh. Harpster is the 
first Tech graduate to be accorded 
such an honor in the field of sports. 
The National Football Hall of 
Fame is at Rutgers University.
Harpster played varsity foot
ball for Tech in 1926-27-28. He 
was captain of the Tartan eleven 
in 1928 which was the same year 
that he was mentioned on the 
All-American Team. Howards 
specialty was drop kicking and he 
is perhaps most remembered here 
at Tech for his two thrilling drop 
kicks in the Tartans surprise vic
tory over a powerful Notre Dame 
team. Aside from his prowess as a 
drop kicker, his effective passing 
and play calling was instrumental 
in the 19-0 route of the boys from 
South Bend. Harpster did not 
gain much recognition in running 
but this was because the coaches 
preferred to save him for kicking 
and passing.
Harpster, who also played one 
season of basketball, was enroll
ed in the School of Architecture.

Water Polo 
The water polo championship 
game was postponed when no ball

reached, giving the trophy tc both 
the ATO A and ATO B teams.
Good Basketball In The Offing; 
Many Teams In Tight IM Races
As the basketball season swings 
into gear, it becomes apparent 
that every league will be a tight
er race. With an unprecedented 
42 teams in 6 leagues, there are 
many good teams and few really 
exceptional ones.
Some of the recent scores are: 
Trojans 50, Frosh Architects 41; 
Tech Gems 60, BTP A 39; PKA 
30, ATO O 24, Frothinslosh
Five 45, SN B 27, ASCE 51, TX

Several tight battles seem to be 
shaping up, especially in the
Plaid, Scot, and Tech leagues. Al
though the season is too young 
for a Fearless Forecast, one might 
keep an eye on the Rockets.

organization. It is a group of Cath
olic students, male and female, 
married and si: gle, who meet the 
second Sunday evening at 7:30. 
|fciter the business on hand is dis
cussed, the evening is spent in 
several ways. During Lent, there 
will be talks by several promi
nent members of the religious or
ders. The first will be Monsignor 
Henry A. Carlin, Vicar General of 
the Pittsburgh Diocese and Pastor 
of Holy Rosary Church. His sub
ject will be The Seven Sacraments. 
After the talk there is an open 
discussion on any subject the memj^rs wish to inquire about.
On evenings when there is no 
speaker scheduled, members may 
be found conducting a song fest 
around the piano; others spend 
their evening in a friendly game 
of cards where one is certain to 
find a few kibitzers. Still others 
enjoy dancing or just sitting 
around talking and of course, there 
are always some refreshments on 
hand.
 After the business meeting, John 
ajetich showed colored slides of 
Rome, Paris, and Germany. John 
took the pictures while on fur
lough during his Army service, 
and his commentary on these pic
tures was very interesting and 
educational.

Vets Club Interested 
In Campus Problems
By Bob Jack
Last year a group of freshman ex-servicemen, feeling the need 
for a campus organization designed to serve their interests, got to
gether and organized the now flourishing Tech Vets Club. With the 
common background of military service, the Vets set out to create
a club that would provide the ?------------  ----------------------------.
type of social activity they would 
enjoy and which would give them 
a channel whereby they could
collectively provide services for 
the school. With the able guid
ance of Earle R. Swank, Assistant 
Professor of English, the club got 
off to a fine start last spring.
The group has a seven man 
board of directors, each holding 
office for one year but with part 
of the number elected each 
semester. The first chairman of 
the board who helped get the 
club off of the ground was Joe 
Brashear, sophomore mathemati
cian. At present, Jim Belz, sopho
more EE, is chairman.
During the Vets Clubs first 
semester on campus, the members 
served as chairmen and time 
keepers for the Tartan Debate 
Tournament, in addition to hold
ing several social events. This 
semester, the Vets are concerned 
with several campus problems. 
One is the barracks parking lot. 
At present they are making a 
survey of the number of cars 
which use the lot daily and how 
many of that number are block
ed in. If the condition warrants 
it, they plan to erect some form 
of parking markings in order that 
chaotic parking be eliminated.
After the holiday vacation, the 
club plans to hold a service 
seminar for non-veteran stu
dents in order that they might 
have some idea of what to expect 
should they enlist or be drafted. 
The Vets are also investigating 
the need for and possibility of 
building a suitable public address 
system for use in school functions, 
especially the Skibo queen pre
sentations.
Above all the Vets are interest
ed in the campus problems mani
festing itself in the form of poor 
school spirit. This problem has 
beenthe subject of lengthy dis
cussions among the Vets, both at 
club meetings and at informal 
gatherings. They have sent dele
gates to the leadership training 
meetings and feel that as a ma
ture organization interested in 
campus problems they should be 
able to give aid in line with the 
leadership training gained in 
service techniques and experi
ence. By no means, however, have 
the Vets forgotten the social side 
of their calendar. Several rousing 
parties have been held this sem
ester and many things are plan
ned for 1956.
The only requirement for mem
bership in the Vets Club is that 
one be an ex-serviceman. If any 
Carnegie veteran desires mem
bership, he should' contact Jim 
Belz, sophomore EE; Bill Schall, 
sophomore Chem E., or Jim McCullum, senior ME. In order that 
the club may fully realize its 
aims, it must necessarily repre
sent many of the veterans on
