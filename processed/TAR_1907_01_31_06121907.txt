CEI VES DEGREE.
RETECH WINS AN EXCITING GAME.
Director Hamerschlag received the 
degree of Doctor of Science from the 
Western University of Pennsylvania 
last Friday at the commencement ex
ercises. Dr. Hamerschlag was also 
made an honorary member of the W. 
U. P. Alumni Association, and at their 
banquet on Friday night, was the 
principal speaker of the evening. He 
made a very strong speech in which 
he called the men to the support of 
their city. He also commented upon 
the spirit of good-natured rivalry ex
isting between the Western University 
and Tech, and said that it could not 
help but have good results. He was 
given a rousing cheer at the con
clusion.

Before another week two members 
of 1909 will have arrived at the place 
where four years of study will fit them 
for national duties. Mr. Paul S. Reinecke and Mr. David I. Grafton are to 
attend school at West Point and An
napolis respectively. Both men were 
active in school life, the Glee Club 
losing a good singer in Mr. Reinecke 
and the foot-ball team a star lineman. 
We hope they will be heard from fre
quently after they get settled down, 
and will not forget that friends at 
Tech are watching their progress with 
more than a little interest. Good-bye 
and good luck.

On last Saturday the base-ball team 
journeyed to Sewickley to try conclu
sions with the strong Y. M. C. A. team 
of that place. The game was not con
sidered important by certain four 
members of the team, so they didnt 
put in an appearance. Players once 
chosen to represent Tech should stick 
to the team to the end.
The game was not very exciting or 
close until the seventh inning, when 
the score stood 2 to 0 in favor of 
Tech. Sewickley then got four rims 
on straight singles and Tech got ready 
to receive a nice yellow one, but they 
had forgotten to reckon on a certain 
reserved chap of lanky proportions, 
who does not say much on such oc
casions. With the ninth inning and 
two men out, Burgham scored on a 
safe hit by Slocum. Neudorfer, our 
friend in need, then swatted the leath
er for a home run, thus making two 
more points and winning the game.

CHANGES WE MAY EXPECT.
Those students who return next 
September (let us hope that all will re
turn) will find a few minor changes 
in the arrangement of class rooms and 
laboratories. The mechanical labor
atory is already moved to the new lo
cation in Machinery Hall. The archi
tects will vacate that portion of the 
building now occupied by them and 
used as a drawing room, moving back 
into the old place. The drawing room 
in Machinery Hall will be given over 
to Machine Design for Mechanical and 
Electrical students. In the basement 
of the building the government fuel 
testing plant will be located, tempora
rily.
A part of the brick-laying building 
will be turned into the Commons, thus 
relieving us of the appetizing odor of 
coffee and fried eggs every morning. 
The trade school will occupy about 
the same positions as before.
Our friends across the fence will be 
in their own palatial residence at the 
corner of the street. We hope their 
numbers may be materially increased. 
The more the merrier.

iest of us could find leisure for doing 
the extra things by utilizing the odd 
chinks and crevices of time and turn
ing them from idle moments into 
drops of useful knowledge and selfimprovement. It is not the man who 
is surrounded by a luxurious library 
with whole days of leisure on his 
hands who makes the most of his op
portunities. It is rather the man 
who, whenever he gets the chance 
to get hold of a book, will, for the 
five or ten minutes leisure that he 
may have, bathe in its intellectual 
riches and bring up facts that can 
never be loosened from his grasp.
In estimating the time which a man 
can give to self-improvement, it has 
been figured out that if the average 
man lives to be 70 years old, or for 
25,500 days, he will have only about
4,000 days left at his disposal for di
rect intellectual development. Surely, 
then, in looking over the field of suc
cessful men, it can be truly said that 
it has been the little drops of knowl
edge with the added grains of sense 
that have made this country mighty 
and its engineering achievements so 
immense.

ATHLETICS AND THE COLLEGE
STUDENT.
By Charles V. P. Young, Director of
Physical Training at Cornell Uni
versity.
We hear frequent objections raised 
against athletics as at present conduct
ed in many of our institutions of learn
ing; among these that they are con
fined too much to the few who are 
already physically proficient; that the 
play element is largely lost sight of 
in the zeal for victory; and that an 
atmosphere of professionalism is 
thereby created which is antagonistic 
to the proper object and aims of true 
sport.
The close scrutiny to which athletic 
conditions have been subjected in 
many colleges and universities is a 
fair guarantee, I think, that many of 
the evils complained of will be erad
icated. In fact, already have very de
cided steps been taken looking toward 
that end, and in this connection might 
be mentioned, particularly, two rules 
recently adopted by the larger East
ern institutions. I refer to the rule 
requiring one year of residence on 
the part of a student before repre
senting his college on a varsity team, 
and to the rule fixing the period of his 
athletic life at three years. These 
rules should eliminate the subsidized 
athletic and the peripatetic athlete, 
a consummation for which we may be 
devoutly thankful.
But there is one aspect of the prob
lem, hinted at in the objections raised 
above, which needs to be especially 
emphasized, because it is an objection 
that will not be met by multiplied and 
minute eligibility rules. It is the log
ical result of the somewhat exagger
ated athletic conditions of the day.
The severe course of training en
tailed upon candidates for an athletic 
team, in order to attain to the neces
sary degree of endurance and effi
ciency, and the absorbing interest 
with which its progress is watched 
from day to day, owing to the inten
sity of intercollegiate rivalry, do tend 
almost inevitably to surround both
practice and game with an air of pro
fessionalism, which cannot but find 
expression at times in acts which par
take something of rowdyism. It is 
not surprising under present condi
tions, with the attention of the entire 
student body focused upon the few 
who are representing the college on 
the athletic field, that victory should, 
in the minds of many, come to con
stitute the teams sole raison d etre, 
and that the idea of sport, for the sake 
of the sport and exercise, should be 
largely lost sight of.
Multiplicity of rules, by concentrat
ing attention of the many who are ex
cluded by them, or for other reasons, 
upon the favored few, would seem 
rather to aggravate this evil than to 
alleviate it. So, too, the abolition of 
intercollegiate contests would not 
seem to be a solution of the difficulty. 
The evil is not inherent in such ath
letic contests, and on the other hand 
they serve many good and beneficent 
ends. The instincts of competition 
and self-reliance are fundamental to 
the development of character, and 
they call for fullest expression during 
the period of student life. If not given 
an outlet in one direction they will 
take it in another, and what more sat
isfactory and wholesome expression 
can they find than in athletic compe
tition? Nothing appeals to the aver
age student mind with such compell
ing force, and nothing will so quickly 
stir up his energy and ambition.
Not to pursue the subject further, 
it seems to me that the solution to 
athletic problems in our colleges and 
universities lies not in less athletics, 
but in more athletics. Provision for 
wholesome outdoor exercise must be 
made for the large number of men 
who for various reasons are unable to 
make one of the athletic teams, as 
well as for the few physically efficient 
who do make them. When it comes 
to be recognized by educational lead
ers generally that the athletic field, 
with its variety of games and exer
cises, its freedom and excitement, is 
an essential adjunct to university 
equipment, and provision is made for 
the exercise thereon of the entire stu
dent body, then I believe we will have 
in our athletic organization a leaven
ing influence which will make for 
clean and wholesome sport, no matter 
how intense the desire to win. Inter
collegiate contests will then become, 
as they should, events more or less

incidental to the general system of 
physical training.
This is one respect in which we 
may learn from the English universi
ties. It is the custom there, we are 
told, for the entire student body to 
flock to the athletic field at a certain 
period in the afternoon. The univer
sity teams are simply selected from 
those who make the best showing in 
the various minor contests, and the 
final selection of those who shall com
pose such teams is not a signal for all 
the others to cease their games and 
exercises. When all the students are 
thus engaged in friendly competition 
in one or another form of sport, it 
is not to be wondered at that a breach 
of etiquette or sportsmanship should 
be a matter of rare or unheard-of oc
currence.
At anyrate, that also is as it should 
be, and it is toward that goal that Cor
nell, with others, is striving. With a 
fifty-five-acre athletic field adjoining 
the campus in process of preparation, 
and with the organization of the uni
versity into a number of separate and 
distinct colleges, unusual facilities are 
offered for intra-college contests to 
which all students may aspire. Thus 
we have a well-organized base-ball 
league, in which each college plays 
every other college to a prearranged 
schedule. We have a spring regatta 
between crews representing the vari
ous colleges and in which rooters 
may run along the bank (it is held 
on the Inlet) and shout for their re
spective favorites Our first inter-col
lege track meet will be held this 
spring, while a competition in basket
ball for a challenge cup has just been 
completed.
By encouraging participation in 
these and other forms of wholesome 
outdoor exerciseamong which skat
ing and tobogganing, for which we 
have splendid facilities, should also 
be mentioneda general interest in 
athletic sport is being aroused, and its 
benefits, therefore, are less and less 
confined to the few who need them 
least. Instead of requiring gymna
sium work of those who do not need 
it particularly, and who do not want 
it, exercise in other forms is permit
ted, it being the aim of the Depart
ment of Physical Training merely to 
maintain a reasonable supervision, 
and to insure regularity. Perhaps the 
results produced are the best justificationtion of any method, but whether 
mistakenly or not, we believe, and are 
acting upon the assumption, that when 
once the picture of an entire student 
body engaged upon the athletic field 
or elsewhere in some form of pastime 
becomes a reality, the athletic prob
lem for Cornell will have been solved.

MECHANICALS AND ELECTRICALS 
VISIT DISPATCH.
On Saturday evening Prof. Follows 
and a representative following of the 
Electricals and Mechanicals gathered 
at the new building of the Dispatch 
Publishing Company for the purpose 
of seeing some of the machinery in 
operation that is necessary to print a 
large newspaper. The Sunday edition 
was in the process of construction and 
the time was therefore a good one 
but there were not more than twenty 
students present.
The lectrotyping and linotype de
partments were first visited. The stu
dents were here shown the process of 
making etchings from photographers. 
The Dispatch is noted for the number 
of pictures in each issue, and this de
partment is, consequently, one of the 
most important. The company owns 
26 linotype machines, which set more 
news into print than could 120 com
positors working by hand under the 
old method. The next point of inter
est was the press-room, where the 
type is cast from paper mats and 
placed into the presses.
There are two pressesa sextuple 
and an octuple, the first having a ca
pacity of 48,000 12-page papers per 
hour and the latter having the same 
capacity of 16-page papers per hour. 
The apparatus for pasting and folding 
and the methods of cutting and count
ing the papers were noted with inter
est.
The engine room contains two 
American Ball Engines directly con
nected to dynamos, a small air com
pressor for the pneumatic tube sys
tem, and the necessary pumps and 
apparatus.
--------o--------
THE FALL OF THE COMMITTEE.
It was midnight in Woodlawn Cot
tage and all was still, save that 
Hwangte Knight snored like a bat
tered B flat cornet.
From room to room Beek passed 
with the word that the committees 
time was come, but unmindful of the
clouds on the horizon, Sprengle slept 
the uneasy sleep of the convict and 
Todd argued a question of disputed 
veracity with his room-mate. Hwangte 
recognized the approaching storm 
by snoring like distant thunder in the 
mountains.
Then the allies gathered outside 
three doors and all was ready. Sud
denly Knight made a noise like a 
slip in a blast furnace. It was the 
signal; Todd was seized in the act of 
promising fearful things if he said it, 
Sprengle was awakened by Todds 
frantic shouts, but was nabbed as he 
left his room. Through the noise and I 
confusion, Herbert continued making 
noises with his nose. Finally he ceased, 
sat up, looked wise and listened. The 
impossible was done, Knight was 
awake and ready for the fray. He 
ran to his door, opened it and let in 
the conquerors of Todd, who had al
ready taken his bath. In silence he 
went under the shower, and as soon 
as he was out of the way, Stripes hur
ried downstairs and into the tub.
After the committee was disposed 
of, the unwashed men, Thompson, 
Barnes, Decker, Huntley and Smith, 
took a turn at the tub, with good re
sults. Then peace descended on the 
house, and Herbert made noises like 
an ungreased wheelbarrow.

THE PHILHARMONIC LITERARY 
SOCIETY.
The Philharmonic Literary Society 
held its last meeting for the year on 
last Thursday afternoon. The fact 
that this was the final meeting brought 
out a large number of members and 
they agreed unanimously that their 
time had been well spent. The knowl
edge that this would be the last op
portunity for three months that they 
would see one another together, gave 
a deeper and more sincere feeling of 
comradeship than has hitherto been 
felt.
The speakers put their whole heart 
into their work and deserved all the

spersed with Biblical quotations 
(which, to tell the truth, seemed to 
come almost naturally from the per
former) told them what the had

that they had just borrowed for keeps. 
Paul Reinecke, accompanied by Mr. 
Oetting, favored the society with two 
vocal selections, which were much ap
preciated.
The star performer with tricks of

ENGINEERING NOTES.
The power transmitted by belting 
depends directly on the speed and the 
amount of pull exercised. The greater 
the speed, the more power is trans
mitted for the same pull on the belt, 
or the greater the speed the less pull 
is required for the same primer. Wire 
rope can be safely run at a consider
ably higher speed than belting and is 
much stronger in proportion to its 
size and weight. It does not often 
replace belting in ordinary work for 
the reason that owing to its small 
size, it does not grip pulleys any
where nearly in proportion to its 
strength. Therefore, to best take ad
vantage of its ability to transmit 
large powers, the rope speed must be 
high and the pulleys must be unu
sually large in diameter to give suffi
cient surface of contact.
--------o--------
A short rule for finding the change 
required in the length of belt when 
one of the pulleys on which it runs is 
changed for one of different size, is 
as follows: Take three times the dif
ference between the diameters of the 
pulleys and divide by two. The re
sult will be the length of belt to cut 
out or put in.
--------o--------
To find the horse power which a 
shaft will transmit at a given speed, 
multiply the cube of the diameter by 
the revolutions per minute and divide 
by 70.
JanitorWhat makes you look so 
scared?
Visitor (in frightened tones)I left 
the banister railing at the flight of 
the stairs.
My instructor in English told me 
not to say hair cut. 
Hows that?
He said it was a barberism.
Do I bore you? asked the mos
quito, politely, as he sunk a half-inch 
shaft into the mans leg.
Not at all, replied the man, 
squashing him with a book. How do
I strike you?
Excited wifeProfessor! the cook 
has fallen and broken her collarbone.
ProfessorDischarge her at once. 
You told her what to expect if she 
broke anything more.
Mr. Jones' My dear, I have decid
ed to swear off smoking.
Mrs. JonesOh, John! And I had 
just bought you a box of cigars for a 
birthday present.
Mr. JonesUm, yesso I noticed.

worst?
