For engineers 
who think 
of more than 
engineering.
Creative people like John Gardner 
see engineering as only one outlet 
for their talents.
Among John's other concerns is today's 
widespread shortage of technical talent. 
Due in large part, as he sees it, 
to children's lack of exposure to the 
excitement of science.
John's doing something about it.
He's turned the Gardner basement into a 
part-time laboratory, with almost-weekly 
demonstrations and projects.for 
neighborhood kids. Where children as 
young as seven make simple photoelectric 
devices. Measure ballistic projectile 
velocities. And explore subjects like 
polarized light, fiber optics, and electronic 
calculators, with the help of equipment 
loaned by Xerox.
"My biggest delight," John recalls, "was 
seeing the first youngster's face light up 
when he gave his home-made electric 
motor a shove, and it kept moving/' 
"Children's interests," John maintains, 
"should be stimulated early. Not by

Editor, the Tartan:
Student Government elections 
should be billed as A Comedy 
of Errors. This became all too 
obvious in the last election when 
a typographical error resulted in 
a decision to have a re-election 
in the AWS constituency.
Only a very small percentage 
of people on campus ever bother 
to vote one  when polls are scat
tered all over campus for two days. 
(Who can blame them? Why 
bother to fill in a ballot when you 
probably wont know the people 
on it or anything about them).
This second election was sche
duled to be held in Morewood 
Cafeteria for one day during 
lunch and dinner  a total of 
four hours! Having the re-elec
tion in this area for such a short 
time practically limited the elec
tion to girls who live in Morewood. and more specifically, to 
girls on food contract! Offcampus commuters in AWS were 
not even given a chance to vote, 
since the notice which appeared 
in the Tartan gave the wrong day 
for the elections!
To top everything off. in the 
ballot for the second election 
there were TWO typographical 
mistakes in name spelling.
For these reasons. I have pro
posed to Student Government, an 
invesitgation into election proce
dures. hoping that a re-vamping 
of the present system will take 
place. Student Government elec
tions are meaningless farces  
and they should not be. Changes 
must be made in the inadequate 
campaign and polling publicity. 
It is impossible to generate en
ough enthusiasm to get an intelli
gent and democratic election when:

What Color?
Editor. The Tartan:
In response to the letter which 
appeared in last Friday s issue 
from Frederick, who objected 
to eating with colored high 
school students, we have a ques
tion. Just our of curiosity, what 
color were they?
(Names withheld by request)
Pencil Inflation
Editor, the Tartan:
The high price of 8c per p< ncil 
in the CMU bookstore is quite 
unreasonable (8.48c apiece with 
tax). When Woodlawn Pharmacy 
was in operation, it offered pen
cils at the much lower price of 
three for a dime (3.53c apiece with 
tax). Since the purpose of the 
CMU bookstore is to supply stu
dents with equipment necessary 
to promote higher education and 
not to supply high profits to 
heads of pencil coorporations. I 
strongly feel that the price of 
pencils in the CMU bookstores 
should be reduced by a factor of 
at least two.

Kibbee Elected President of Bd. of Education
by NANCY MADSEN
Robert J. Kibbee, Vice-Presi
dent for Administration and Plan
ning at C-MU was recently elec
ted President of the Pitts
burgh Board of Education. This 
board is responsible for finances, 
policy, educational innovations, 
and personnel appointments for 
all the public schools in the city 
of Pittsburgh.
Mr. Kibbees duties as Presi
dent of the school board will not 
conflict with his responsibili
ties at C-MU. The board consists 
of fifteen non-paid volunteers; 
board meetings are held in the 
evening.
In addition to his regular ac
tivities as president of the board, 
Mr. Kibbee feels that the first 
change he would like to make is 
to improve the image of the board 
in the eyes of the public. Last 
year some Pittsburghers felt that 
the school board was not respon
sive to their wishes. Mr. Kibbee 
would like to try to involve these 
concerned citizens more in discus
sions of the board, and is willing 
to listen to complaints and sug
gestions about the schools, and 
their problems.
Board responsibilities include 
such decisions as hiring the su
perintendent of schools, planning 
the budget, approving appoint
ments of teachers, and bussing 
students. An open enrollment 
policy now exists, in which any 
student may attend any Pitts
burgh school which is not over
crowded, and free transportation 
is provided for him to do so.
Perhaps the most important de
cision Mr. Kibbee will have to 
make in his one-year term as 
president of the board is whether

or not to implement the plan for 
great high schools' in the city. 
According to this plan, four or 
five high schools with facilities 
for no more than 6000 students 
would be built, and located, one 
in the east end. one in central 
city, one on the north side, and 
one or two on the south side. 
The high schools would be broken 
down into four units or colleges 
with their own administra
tors, and would offer college pre
paratory. business, vocational, and 
general education.
There are several reasons for 
building the great high schools. 
First, more varied programs could
be offered. Students would have 
opportunities to take unusual cour
ses such as Chinese, which cannot 
presently be given because of 
the limited demand, and facili
ties would exist for more special
ized training especially in the vo
cational fields. A second reason 
is that if the new schools were 
strategically located, the ra
cial balance in the schools would 
be the same as that within the 
total school population.
Existing high schools would be 
converted to miMle schools for 
the sixth, seventh, eighth, and 
ninth grades. MovingVixth graders
to middle schools would ease over
crowded conditions in the ele
mentary schools. Some of the 
older high schools would be aban
doned.
Architects are working on the 
final drawings for several of the 
schools, and land has been ac
quired on the North Side. South 
Side, and East End. However, 
with increasing construction costs 
and inflation, each school will cost 
approximately 50 million dollars. 
The city of Pittsburgh will prob
ably not be able to afford to build 
the schools without aid from the 
state or federal governments.
The decision concerning the 
great high schools" will have to 
be made next spring when the 
plans are finished, and it will be 
just one of Mr. Kibbee's many re
sponsibilities as president of the 
Pittsburgh Board of Education.

Page 4  THE TARTAN  Tuesday, November 18, 1969Peace and People, Excitement and Solemnity
by ERICA BORDEN
We knew what we were doing 
and why we were doing it. Peace 
and People. We were excited 
but solemn. Our purpose was a 
serious one  to end and reverse 
a tragic mistake in American his
tory. Yet the people we saw on 
the Pennsylvania Turnpike Thurs
day morning, all flashing the 
peace sign and smiling, with liscense plates from Wisconsin and 
Kansas, made us happy. We were 
sure the Moratorium would be a 
success.
We listened to the radio on 
the way. Nixon would be at Cape 
Kennedy. Over a quarterof a mil
lion people were descending on 
Washington. Agnew became a 
television critic. Nixon refused to 
meet with Moratorium leaders. 
Nothing much was new.
Washington was infested with 
our people. Ebeneezer Methodist 
Church, headquarters for the New 
Mobilization, was our first stop. 
People with sleeping bags were 
congregated on the steps 
singing. A bearded guy waved us 
welcome and gave the peace sign. 
It wasnt hard to tell that this 
was the headquarters for our re
volution. A hog farmers bus was 
parked outside. Inside, people 
were sleeping anywhere they could 
find room, trying to catch a few 
winks before the rigors of the 
campaign began.
Cheese and peanutbutter and 
jelly sandwiches, the fuel of the 
movement, were being rationed in 
the kitchen. Signs on doors 
read, Law Department, First 
Aid, Lost and Found. The Mis
sing Persons Department was 
empty now  but it would be 
swamped when the busses ar
rived.
Sleeping bags and nap sacks 
were beginning to pile up in the 
Baggage Room. One guy was 
in the process of making a sign 
to put in front of his long wood
en table, Not responsible for 
lost articles.
In another corner, more mar
chers were cutting black arm 
bands to be worn on the March 
Against Death. One safety pin  
iystant mourning for those of us 
who would rather be spending out 
time watching the college of our 
choice being stomped in a foot
ball game.
Kids in bell bottoms distribut
ed maps of Washington to the new 
arrivals. One newspaper an
nouncing the Washington No
vember days, read We come 
in peace. The map is keyed to 
our purpose. Marshalls posts, the 
medical center, the legal head
quarters are all carefully mark
ed.
One notice reads, "Mobe 
marshals meet here. Thats us. 
We expected to be given arm 
bands and a time and that would 
be it. But this was a profession
al organization. It was not a joke. 
After signing up for the fourth 
shift on the March Against 
Death from 6:30 a.m.  2 p.m. Fri
day and 3:00 a.m.  10 a.m. Sa
turday and for all of the Mass 
March, we were taken outside for 
our training session.
Role playing was the method. 
We took turns acting out roles 
as marshals, marchers, hecklers 
and police. What would we do 
if hecklers ripped off the marchers 
signs with the names of the war 
dead on them? Let them have 
them, was our conclusion. What 
would you do if a marcher got 
hit on the head with a bottle and 
was bleeding? Get him out of line, 
call first aid and keep the march 
moving. Above all, our respon
sibility was to the marchers and 
we could not forget that.
Our purpose was tied in with our 
attitude. The style and tone of 
our directions would determine 
whether people accepted us. We 
were there to serve; not to police. 
We must be flexible, think quickly, 
keep cool, and take the initiative 
in case of trouble. We should en
gage hecklers in conversation. Our 
instruction sheet read, "Be polite. 
Smile. Nothing is more disarming.
After receiving more instruc
tions (Be kind to impudent 
snobs), we took a nap before 
joining the Pennsylvania delega
tion to walk in the March Against 
Death. But our effort to sleep 
was futile  the excitement kept 
us awake.
The Pennsylvania Delegation 
met at Reception Center E, the 
Metropolitan AME Church, to 
take a shuttle bus to Arlington 
where we would receive a sign of 
a war dead and begin the four 
mile march to the Capitol. 
Throngs of people who had 
just stepped off their buses were 
milling around, dropping off 
luggage, grabbing a bite to eat 
before starting on the March.
We hopped on the nearest 
shuttle bus after waving "hi to 
familiar faces from C-MU. The 
bus was filled with Penn State 
people, but we managed to squeeze 
on. Just before the doors shut, we 
spotted a familiar face in the 
crowd outside. Siegal! we cried. 
Come with us. Soon the bus was 
reverberating with "Come on 
Siegal, and as he ran onto the 
bus, the crowd cheered.
We sang solemn songs, happy 
songs, yelled, "No more war any
more, and felt very much a part 
of the largest anti-war demonstra
tion in history as we passed the 
Lady Bird Johnson Memorial 
Park on the way to the Cemetary.
We joined thousands of mar
chers in green and white striped 
tents set up by the River to re
ceive our black arm bands, cand
les and name.
For over two hours, I was Cur
tis Duck of California, dead in 
Vietnam. I did not know Cur
tis, but I imagine he was about
19 years old. As I marched across 
the bridge, with my candle flick
ering, occasionally going out but 
immediately relighted by fellow 
marchers, I developed a kin
ship with the boy whose name I

wore on a string around my neck. 
It wasn't just a piece of card
board. I just hoped there would 
not be another Curtis Duck 
whose name I would be carry
ing on a placard.
As we walked quietly in single 
file around the Lincoln Memorial 
and on toward the White House, 
the two of us  Curtis and I  
bore our heavy responsibility pur
posefully. We observed traffic 
lights ... thought about peace.
Young and old faces glowed in 
the light of the candles. Ponchos, 
boots, buttons, love beads and 
blankets were visible down the 
line. It was a community of peace 
people.
When we got to the center gate 
of the White House a marshal 
was standing with his arm raised. 
"That man inside is listening. he 
said. "Shout out that name so he 
can hear you.
"Curtis Duck. I yelled and my 
heart ached. "Charles Iopa." 
"Frederick Burge. the names 
rang out in the darkness.
We crossed First Street appro
aching the Capitol, and passed 
the Peace Monument depicting 
America weeping on the should
ers of History for the Civil War 
Dead. How much longer will this 
go on we wondered. When will it 
stop?
Flickering candles glowed as 
the marchers passed in front of 
the Capitol building. The end of 
the March was in sight. Before 
we placed our names in the cof
fins at the bottom of the Hill, 
we had a moment of regret  we 
would have marched longer. We 
didnt want to take those placards 
off our necks. But even when we 
laid it in the vyooden box. we 
knew that for a long time Curtis 
and others would be with us. We 
wouldnt forget.
It v/as cold and we were tired. 
As we walked back at Ebeneezer 
where marshals were being dis
patched to various posts along the 
line of march. We received our 
assignment at the Lincoln Mem
orial. Although shuttle buses were 
supposed to take us to our sta
tions, a strike of bus drivers left 
us without a ride. But all difficul
ties that weekend were to be 
overcome. A guy sleeping in the 
cab of his Hertz rent-a-truck 
was woken to drive about 60 
marshals (it seemed like 1,000) 
squeezed together in an upright 
position in the back of the truck, 
to their posts.
Those on the shift before us 
were glad to be relieved. They 
were cold and hungry but expres
sed regret at having to leave. 
We stood in the street, stopping 
traffic for marchers and marchers 
for traffic. "Good morning.. 
"Peace. "How are you today?
Photo by Jim Call
"Wow, look at all the people. 
They just keep coming and coming. 
Marchers  every size, shape and 
color, passed us. There were ac
tive GIs. Veterans, priests, wi
dows carrying their dead husbands 
names, people in wheel charis. 
all with a common purpose. One 
guy was carrying a piece of pa
per on his placard. When I told 
him there wasnt supposed to be 
anything on it, he replied, Not 
even my bronze star medal orders 
that I would like to burn? I 
let him pass.
You knew when parents car
ried their sons names. Two peo
ple sadly passed with the same 
name scrawled on both placards. 
But they wished us good morning 
and thanked us for being there.
A veteran passed. He was mis
sing his arm. He kissed me and 
cried softly.
Small children, some barely 
able to walk, passed and gave 
the peace sign. Keep the faith kids,
I thought.
A bearded man carrying a gui
tar passed and sang quietly, "All 
we are saying is give peace a 
chance. Not until he had passed 
did I realize it had been Pete 
Seeger. Another marshal further 
up said, "Good morning, Pete.
One girl who passed had the 
peace sign painted on her face in 
black and white, she was wearing 
a black robe. Another marcher 
walked with a death mask. We 
could not forget why we were 
there.
As I held back the marchers to 
let cars pass we gave signs of 
welcome. Many carloads and 
busses of marchers returned our 
greeting. The line cheered when 
army and navy personnel returned 
the peace sign. There is hope.
Even the feelings caused by 
those few. hostile drivers who 
yelled at us or tried to hit us 
were overcome by the others (in
cluding Ted Kennedy and Clif
ford Case) who drive by and ex
pressed support.
Armed with boxes of cookies 
and crackers which we brought 
for the marchers, we returned to 
the Church at 3:00 a.m. to be 
dispatched to our posts again. 
People in creased shirts munch
ing sandwiches were eager to get 
out in the streets. We bundled up 
in layers of sweatshirts and sweat
ers and someone offered to drive 
us back to the Lincoln Memorial.
Despite the below freezing 
weather, the marchers kept com
ing  wrapped in blankets and 
sleeping bags. Many had just ar
rived. The University of Wis
consin delegation (18 busloads 
strong) walked by. A sign passed 
.... "Pennsylvania Dead 2100.
I stood saying Good morning 
to the marchers and handing 
out cookies. Though tired and 
hungry, every marcher returned 
the greeting with big smiles 
and peace signs. People from home 
I had not seen in over five years 
passed and recognized me. We 
hugged hello, feeling a bond 
that had never before existed. 
One old friend was now a theolo
gical student. He Marched with 
fellow clergymen and nuns. Peace 
was in their faces.
We stood outside and watched 
the thousands pass as the sun rose. 
About 7:00 a.m. the last of the 
marchers walked by. Our faces, 
red from the cold, smiled and wish
ed them a beautiful march. The 
March Against Death had been a 
success. We felt very much a part 
of it.
As we walked downtown to 
wait for the March on Washing
ton to begin we stopped at 
George Washington University. 
There, in the F Street Dormitory, hundreds of kids were sack
ed out on the floor. Others were 
eating chicken soup and bagels 
being sold across the street for 35 
cents. Bags of Wonder Bread, some
times slapped with peanut 
butter, were visible in all corners 
of the room. Sterno flames heat
ed cans of Cambell Sout mar
chers had brought from home.
As the morning descended upon 
us and newspapers were distri
buted, many read about their 
March. We were sorry to hear 
of the violence in front of the 
South Vietnamese Embassy. We 
did not want people to think of 
the two demonstrations as one. 
We wanted no part of violent 
actions. But we knew that some 
people reading the morning pa
pers would think that the violent 
and non-violent were one and the 
same. How could we get to them 
and tell them it was not true?
People talked about peace and 
Nixon and the March in all corn
ers. I honestly think I haved more 
intelligence than Agnew, one guy 
stated positively.
You cant say Nixon didnt 
help us, one girl said. He cer
tainly added to our ranks by giv
ing that speech.
Across the street was SDS head
quarters. But only a few people 
went there.
About 9:00 a.m. announcements 
were broadcast over the loud 
speakers in the lobby. The Michi
gan Delegation is now meeting 
to walk to the Capitol to begin 
the March. People rose wearily 
from the floor, ready to begin 
the Mass March.
At 10:00 we joined the mar
chers to walk to the Washington 
Monument where we were sta
tioned as marshals. After receiv
ing our instructions, we walked 
around the grounds and saw food 
stands being set up to sell hotdogs, apples and potato chips. 
Television cameras were position
ed all around the grounds.
Thousands of people who had 
arrived too late to march were 
beginning to congregate in front 
of the stage. Doubling up in 
sleeping bags, eating breakfast, 
they kept their eyes focused on 
the marchers who were about to 
enter the grounds.
We walked to the Monument 
and peered over the mall. Hun
dreds of thousands gathered to 
hear the memorial worship ser
vice led by Senator Eugene Mc
Carthy, the Rev. William Sloane 
Coffin, and Coretta King.
Soon the march arrived at the 
rally grounds. They sang, "All 
we are saying is give peace a 
chance. as the moved slowly to 
the stage. About 20 people in the 
front line carried American flags.

Before I got on one of the Thursday buses, I had said to everybody who was going, 
See you in Washington! I dont know exactly when I realized that there were Thursday peo
ple and Saturday people and that out of a million-and-a-half people gathered at the rally at 
the Washington Monument, Pittsburgh people were going to be only a hoarse whisper in the 
great shout of the vocal minority. _
Our bus came together very 
quickly. The Point Park people 
at the back were passing out wine, 
etc., and the Resistance people 
at the front were passing back 
apples and peanut butter. We 
had a guitarist at the back, and 
we asked his friend to get the 
guitar, and when he said Hal 
wouldnt be separated from his 
guitar, we yelled, Get the guitar 
player! The bus floated the rest 
of the way to the March against 
Death on high spirits and song. 
We are marching to the 
President, the President
We were ushered into the first 
indoctrination tent at Arlington 
where they began the first of the 
button hustles. The New Mobe 
is a $100,000 in debt. Be the first 
on your block to buy a button. 
We have only a limited supply. 
We laughed at the slight exaggera
tion. considering all we could see 
were tiers of buttons. The hoarse 
marshal (and the March against 
Death was then only four hours 
old) waved us on to the next tent 
when the group ahead of us moved 
on. and an even hoarser marshal 
told us that in the last tent we 
would get a black armband, a 
candle, and the name of an Am
erican soldier killed in Vietnam.
We waited quietly in line for 
the march to begin, getting to 
know the name we carried on a 
placard around our necks. We 
marched single-file across the 
bridge where they lit our candles 
and on into the cold night. We 
Shared our lights with people 
whose candles had gone out and 
shared the greater light inside us 
with everyone who marched and 
was still to march and each one 
of thos 40.000 people that we were 
marching for so that their deaths 
could mean peace to those still 
living. As we approached the 
White House, a marshal told us 
to yell the name out as loud as 
we could  Make him hear it   
and each person vented all his 
anger and frustration and agony 
at the death of that man whose 
name he shouted. The March on 
Death never stopped for those 
forty house. It did not end when 
I placed STEPHEN HEPNER. 
ARIZONA, into a coffin. Forty 
thousand people will never forget 
the names of the dead men that
they represented. Their names can
not be obliterated from our minds, 
no matter how much the ad
ministration wants to dehuman
ize this war of people.
This was the last experience 
common to all the Pittsburgh peo
ple. After we reached the Caitol, there were as many dif
ferent stories of Washington as 
there were small circles of 
friends. Waiting for the shuttle 
buses to the reception cen
ters, a group of people built a 
fire, only one of the many bat
tles against the hostile winter 
environment. Our reception cen
ter, which became a haven, had 
coffee and sandwiches, our gear 
and housing for Pittsburghers at 
the University of Maryland. Some 
of our CMU people stayed on the 
campus till Saturday, helping 
U of M Students in their anti
war activities (which included 
getting permission to house
4.000 people) and found out what 
it was like to be outside agita
tors. Our little unit of five at
tended the memorial service at 
Nstional Cathedral, where Pete 
Seeger led the singing, taking 
God out of the songs and put
ting man back into them. A 
mother of a G.I. killed in Viet
nam was one of the Witnesses for 
Peace, and she explained that in 
order for her son's death to have 
any meaning, we would have to 
create a better world. That was 
why she had marched for peace 
before, that was why she was mar
ching now, and that was why she 
would continue ot march It 
was hard to sing We Shall Over
come after that, because of the 
awful realization of what the 
March on Death had meant to 
someone carrying the name of a 
son. or a husband, or a brother 
No one made a move to leave 
after the service was over, and 
a small group started All we are 
saying is give peace a chance."' 
which has become the plea of our 
movement, and the Cathedral 
resounded wit it, and then just 
a small group from the front 
sang it, and a group in back an
swered. and after wards we all 
joined in again.
The five of us got a ride back 
to our reception center from a
lovely elderly couple who said 
Everyone has got to realize 
that wars are senseless. We step
ped out of the car exclaiming 
how beautiful everything was 
when the tear gas hit us. We 
fumbled blindly to the center and 
ended up going in the wrong di
rection and back tracking.
We joined the group pouring into 
our center, choking and tearing, 
and feeling our cheeks stinging. 
Inside the marshals were adminis
tering aid to all the victims. We 
learned that it was not our cen
ter that had been attacked, but 
rather the Weathermen and Craz
ies who were having a confronta
tion at the South Vietnamese 
Embassy two blocks away.
The Saturday march was a 
very cold, very happy picnic. 
Youre all so beautiful beamed 
the marshals through chattering 
teeth. I think they were the most 
beautiful of all. They made sure 
everything was peaceful, they 
were so proud of everybody for 
just being there and they were 
willing to accept the responsi
bility of overseeing the partici
pants through the rain, the hail 
and the cold, not to mention 
the teargas. As we passed a 
group of frozen marshals in the 
shade, our entire column started 
jumping with them, chanting 
Jump for peace. Jump for 
peace! It was an incredible 
march to be in. I never saw where 
it started, and it had to end before 
many people even got a chance to 
march, since the permit expired 
at 1 oclock.
When they announced at the 
rally that the radios estimated a 
million and a half, we did a hap
py dance which helped warm us 
up a little bit. Hundreds of fires 
ringed by people disposed of the 
litter in a very useful way. As 
we searched for Pittsburgh peo
ple to point them to the bus, we 
built a fire too, some of us hav
ing first gotten tear-gassed a sec
ond time by going too near the 
Justice Department to watch the 
protect against the Conspiracy 
trial. I can see us, standing in 
the darkness, calling Pittsburgh! 
Pittsburgh! and hugging anyone 
who came running over, glad be
cause we found.
A Commentary on
 As we took our positions as mar
shals in a line that extended 
past the stage in front of the ral
ly, we watched the people swarm 
in, carrying their flags and ban
ners. A few Vietcong flags were 
evident but they were far out
numbered by American flags.
One group carried a huge wood
en cross on which a black man 
 was symbolically crucified as 
Coretta King addressed the rally. 
Another group carried a banner 
which read, Active G.I.s opposed 
to the war.
Further back was a sign, per
haps eight feet high, displayed 
a picture of Martin Luther King 
and emphasized the need to work 
peacefully for social change
One man in a three piece suit 
 (Probably from Brooks Brothers) 
wore a sign on his back which 
said. Im a middle class straight 
for peace.
Then there were others signs:
 Pull out Dick (like your father 
should have)." "The Majority for 
a Silent Agnew; Hi Folks. 
The Silent Majority is Here To
day; Let the Power Flow to
0. the People; How Many Viet
namese Fought in Our Civil 
War?
As marshals we happened to be 
stationed in the only small area 
of the grounds where people 
could not sit due to the wet, 
Woodstock-like ground.
Lo and behold, who should 
choose that spot to stand in but 
 one of the three contingents of 
Weathermen. That gave us the du
bious distinction of seeing only their 
faces, hearing their cries of Ho 
Ho Ho Chi Minh, Free Bobby 
Sea, Smash the fucking Facist 
State, and One more war  
revolution, and wondering 
whether they would charge us 
trying to get to the stage. For
tunately most people were not 
jp burdened with watching them or 
hearing their ugly shouts.
Although they prevented us from 
seeing the throngs of beauti
ful people who were sitting to
gether in serenity, we could feel 
their presence.
But, we were close enough to 
see and hear the speakers and 
performers. Included among the 
J speakers were notables such as 
Dr. Benjamin Spock, the Rev. 
Coffin, Senator Charles Goodell (R-N.Y.) Senator George Mc
Govern (D-South Dakota),
Leonard Bernstein (He said we 
were "Beautiful), Coretta King, 
and David Dillinger.
"Spiro Agnew is the Richard 
Nixon of the Nixon administra
tion, said Dick Gregory in his 
monologue which left the crowd 
yelling for more.
"And if you take my hand my son, 
all will be well when the day is 
done, sang Peter, Paul and Mary, 
as the crowd joined in.
Pete Seeger and Father Kirk
patrick led the crowd in what 
seemed like endless rounds of 
"All we are saying is give peace 
a chance.
Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, 
Arlo Guthrie, and a quartet from 
Cleveland Symphony also relay
ed the peace message to the 
crowd.
As the rally began to draw to 
close, the New York cast of 
Hair led the crowd in a rous
ing chorus of Let the Sunshine 
In. A jubilant spirit prevaded 
the crowd as we celebrated the 
success of the Moratorium. As 
marshals, still linking arms, we 
danced, jumped up and down, 
and kicked our legs high in 
chorus line fashion.
The climax of the afternoon 
was reached when it was an
nounced that a radio station and 
a national wire service reported 
that one and a half million peo
ple were present on the grounds. 
Doves were released in celebra
tion.
After most of the crowd had 
gone back to their buses and 
cars, we began walking back to 
the car to begin our journey 
home. As we reached the area 
near the Justice Department, we 
encountered a spirit directly 
opposed to what we had been 
experiencing in the past few 
days. Police and National Guards
men in the street. A group of 
militants shouting Pit at 
policemen who had brought 
us coffee in the early morning 
when we were marshaling. Tear 
gas prevaded the air as our eyes 
teared and our throats ached, 
we could only be sorry that we 
could not leave Washington 
only with memories of let 
the shunshine in.
On our weary 'trip home, we 
werent too overjoyed to find we 
had a flat tire. During the five 
minutes it took to change the tire

On The Sports Scene
Tartans March Over
Washington (& Jefferson)
by AL LETZT, Tartan Sports Editor
Saturdays contest against W&J was just a typical run-of-the-mill 
football game. Playing on a cold muddy field in the snow, the Tar
tans won their fourth straight game  a feat which was 
last accomplished by a Tech squad in 1959. They won the game on a 
23 yard field goal by sophomore Mark Wood  the first three point
er kicked by a Tartan player since a road game four years ago. 
Woods 'first field goal ever came with less than five minutes re
maining in the game.
Hindered by the adverse field conditions, most of the backs 
directed their runs toward the center of the field. However, Tartans 
Tom Lombardo and Terry Bell came through with two of the most 
sparkling sprints of the season. Lombardo swept around right end 
early in the first quarter. He was finally forced out of bounds on the 
W&J one yard line to complete a 79 yard play. Tom, who rolled up a 
total of 157 yards in the game, then plunged over the goal line on the 
next play.
With time running out in the first half, Bell took a screen pass 
from Squires near midfield and followed his blockers down the side
lines. Then he caught everyone running the wrong way as he cut back 
laterally across the field and raced to the eighteen yard line where 
two W&J defenders brought him down. The 57 yards rushing gained 
by Bell in this game brought his season total to 644. Lombaedo was 
the second leading rusher on the team with a season total of 531 
yards.
The winning field goal was set up by a pass from Squires to 
Chuck Price which covered 60 yards. Squires had tossed only short 
screens and slant passes for the first three quarters. On this crucil 
play, Rich faked a screen pass to the left side. He then fired a per
fect strike to Price who had his man beat by five yards. Only a W&J 
defender who was angling across the field was able to stop Price from 
going all the way for the TD. Chuck finished the day with four recep
tions for 82 yards.
The CMU defensive secondary has come a long way since the 
opening game. Manned by three freshmen  Dick Miller, Curtis Sim
mons, and Chris OLeary  and Junior Ed Dumont, it has provided 
effective pass coverage over the last half of the season. Even on the 
slippery field Saturday, they allowed Kasperik to complete only one 
third of his passes. When the Presidents tried to come back in the final 
minutes, Simons batted down a pass on the five yard line and later 
picked off another. Miller broke up one apparent completion with a 
jarring tackle and made a key interception to stop their final drive.
Although they only scored nine points, the Tartans compiled im
pressive statistics on offense. Squires completed thirteen of his 26 
passes for 171 yards. The ground game added another 257 yards. 
The presidents only gained 166 total yards on offense.
A final word of thanks to the small but spirited crowd of loyal 
Tartan fans who braced the rugges weather, cheered with the cheer
leaders and saw an amazing football game as well.
Cr Jaooh nopat
Mark Woods 23 yard field goal with the Tartains trailing 7-6 late in the fourth quarter 
lifted CMU to its fourth straight victory Saturday, a 9-7 win over W&J. Surprinsingly, the W&J 
defense and the muddy field held the explosive Tech team to only one touchdown. The Tar
tans moved the ball well and dominated all the statistics but failed to cash in on some good 
scoring opportunities. The victory seals the CMU record at 4-4.
CHARLEY PRICE grabs this pass from Rich ainPno kI sheeI pbolbmSquires and was finally brought down on the 11 yard Woods field goal that won the game for the
line after a 60 yard gain. This play set up Mark Tartans 9-8.

The highlight of the day was a 
run by Tom Lombardo midway 
through the first quarter. Taking 
a pitchout from Rich Squires 
around right end, Lombardo 
broke loose aided by a great 
block by Tackle Dick Helhowski. He raced 79 yards down the 
sideline before he was driven out 
of bounds on the one yard line. 
Lombardo scored from there on 
the next play giving CMU an 
early 6-0 lead. The two point 
conversion attempt was stopped 
short of the end zone.
It appeared as if the Tartans 
were going to take over when Kas
perik fumbled on the fourth down 
play. But the W&J halfback quick
ly retrieved the ball and somehow 
managed to score. W&J became 
the first team to take the lead 
against CMU in three weeks when 
Houston Marshall converted the 
extra point for a 7-6 lead.
CMU continued pounding out 
yardage with Terry Bell. Lom
bardo, and Squires carrying the 
ball. But the Tartarts could not 
put a sustained drive together.
Finally late in the fourth quar
ter Tech struck quickly on a 60 
yard pass play from Squires to 
Charley Price that put the 
ball on W&J 11. Lombardo moved 
through the middle for three yards 
and after an incompletion, Mike 
Kuhnell took a pass but was stop
ped on the 6. At this point, Coach 
Gasparella elected to try for a 
field goal, a rare occurrence for 
a tartan team. Wood, who had con
nected on 11 of 12 extra points in 
the last two games, calmly boot
ed the ball through the uprights 
to put C-MU ahead to stay, 9-7.
Last year's game at W & J 
was also a mud battle but this 
one had ice and snow in addi
tion to freezing temperatures. A 
small but enthusiastic crowd of 
snow-balling students attend
ed the game and the ones that 
stayed to the end saw a good sea
son end on a happy note.

The lead held until W&J capi
talized on a CMU miscue in the 
third quarter. The President cor
ailed Mark Wood who had trouble 
handling a low snap from center 
when trying to punt from the 
W&J 22 yard line. A pass from 
Don Kasperik to John Metzgar

Pittsburgh Form for Experimental Plays
by RICHARD RE1CHMAN
The Artichoke Theatre is some
thing I dont think weve had in 
Pittsburgh before; a forum for the 
exclusive presentation of new plays. 
Not only must the plays be new, 
but they must lean towards the 
experimental. We want to join the 
movement currently trying to re
vitalize this warning art form.
It seems to me that rock music 
is the only art that has caught up 
with the times and the reasons 
for this provides a significant lession for those of us who work 
in the theatre. Rock, unlike the 
theatre, does not regress upon it
self. It is an odd fact, unique to 
our times, that almost all of the 
productions mounted on our stages 
are old plays. Revivals are so com
mon that they are not even treat
ed a such, while originals are 
always singled out as unusual 
events  and, unfortunately, they 
are. Even the directors who want 
to do experimental work are more
incluined to gas-up an old script 
than do a new one. In all my time 
at CMU I have never seen a pro
duction of a new play and the in
frequent experiments performed 
have all been based on scripts at 
least a century old. The result is 
that our theatres have become 
museums in which collision with 
contemporary concerns is a rare 
accident.
The Artichoke and the many 
groups like it starting all over 
the country are not just in time 
to save the theatre from losing 
its audiences. The damage has al
ready been done.
Our country's freaked-out hip
pies. yippies, peace-niks, and 
their comic sympathizers are po
tentially the most sensitive and 
intelligent audience members in 
history, and it is precisely these 
people who shy away from thea
tres because they offer so little 
to interest them. To attract this 
audience, we want to do innovaXEROCENTER * new location

tive work in a contemporary vo
cabulary common to us all, and 
keep the tickets cheap. Much 
as I love the threatre, Im hard 
put to remember a show worth 
ten bucks. The Artichoke asks 
One Dollar.
We are not a highly structured 
organization. Each director will 
work autonomously. For actors, 
we want to attract drama stu
dents who want to escape the stan
dard proscenium  ware done on 
resources we lack. In our first 
production which I am direct
ing. we have two English profes
sors, a store owner, a graphic ar
tist, and our designer is an arch
itecture student whose imagina
tion is far more liberated than 
that of a shopworn theatre crafts
man. All of this is not to say that 
we are an amateur group. Our 
work is hard and serious and we 
intend to contribute something of 
real beauty to the winter even
ings in Pittsburgh.
Of course, we can't promise that 
everything we do will be good. An 
experimental theatre runs a high
er risk of producing a clink
er than a traditional one. Also, 
we don't expect unanimity of 
opinion on Anything we do. On 
the other hand, we can promise 
that ALL our shows will be in
teresting and that the best of them 
will mean a lot to you. Even 
our most dismal failure will be 
more exciting than warmed-over 
Shakespeare seen afar, from a seat 
nailed to the floor, by an audience 
eager to escape Renaissance prob
lems for a contemporary smoke in 
the lobby.
If you have read this far. you 
are at least curious about us and 
you ought to take the next step: 
buy a ticket. Dont wait for our 
second show because we lose our 
financial support if we dont get
