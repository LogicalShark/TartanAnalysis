A few years ago, if you told an 
upper-level student that Skibo 
Hall was going to be tom down, 
they wouldhave thought you were 
crazy. Now, its about to become a 
reality.
The University is in the final 
stages of preparation for Skibos 
destruction, scheduled for some 
time in July. At the same time 
the former Naval Reserve Center 
(NRC) is in the final stages of 
renovations to prepare for its role 
as temporary home of most of the 
organizations currently housed 
in Skibo.
Skibo is coming down to make 
way for the new University Cen
ter, which is scheduled to open in 
the fall of 1996.
All organizations are currently 
preparing to move out of Skibo. 
According to Bonnie Gorman, asDESTRUCTIONUPDATE
sistant director of Student Ac
tivities, there are 35 organiza
tions moving over to the NRC. 
That includes... groups with stor
age areas, said Gorman.
Some organizations will not be 
moving to the Naval Center. Such 
organizations as the Inter-Fra
ternity Council, Panhel, and the 
Oakland Review did not apply for 
space. WRCT will be moving into 
the Caber Club, which closed 
March 26. Most of the equipment 
from the Caber Club has been or 
will be moved over to the gym.
The last function that Skibo 
will house will be the commence
ment ceremony on May 15, and 
the next day Skibo will close its 
doors forever.
During that week, the organi
zations will make their move from 
Skibo to the NRC. Some organi
zations will take a day to move. 
Others like The Tartan, AB, and 
A Phi 0 will require moving 
trucks and a bit more time since 
these organizations have more 
equipment.
Once Skibo has been completely 
evacuated, there will still be a 
few things that have to be taken 
care of. The actual destruction 
will take some time, said Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Affairs.
The building will then have to 
go through five to six weeks of 
asbestos removal in accordance 
with Federal and State public 
health codes. When the building 
has been cleared it will be ready 
for destruction. By July [Skibo] 
will be ready to come down, said 
Murphy.

Saturday night marked 
the end of another Carnival 
at CMU, and rain and heavy 
winds didnt dampen the fes
tivities, although some required a 
change of venue.
This year, patrons of Spring Carni
val were shut out early as booths and 
rides were all closed by 8 pm Satur
day.
After a beautiful Thursday and Fri
day morning, Carnivals first sign of 
trouble came during the much antici
pated Belly concert. Belly stepped on 
stage at 3:15 pm, and not long after, 
lightning filled the sky. The band was 
told they would not be allowed to con
tinue, and had to stop performing at 4 
pm.
Tonya Donnally, Bellys lead singer, 
told the crowd, I love you but I wouldnt 
die for you.
Heavy winds and rain Friday night 
would also took their toll on the booths 
lining the Midway. Beta Theta Pis 
The Eiffel Tower, Kappa Sigmas 
Beer Wurld, and SDCs Cities 
Around the World, were tom apart by 
the weather and were shut down on 
Saturday.
Other fraternities and sororities, as 
well as some clubs, suffered damage to 
their booths. SigmaAlpha Epsilon said
the wind had taken out one 
of the trees from their 
Gilligans Island booth, 
but that had not stopped 
crowds from coming. 
Weve been doing awe
some, said one brother.
Delta Gammas backdrop sets for 
their Great Barrier Reef were begin
ning to blow over and in order to avoid 
the risk of them falling on top of chil
dren visiting the booth, DG took them 
down.
The Asian Student Associations 
largest problem came with running 
paint. Otherwise, their colorful booth 
held up well.
Another quick change in plans came 
when SDC had to move events that 
were scheduled for their comer stage 
tent to inside Skibo Saturday.
Mindy Drake, SDC tent chair, said 
that heavy winds had made the tent 
unstable and acts were moved into 
various rooms around Skibo.
Drake said that the crowds Satur
day had not been as heavy as the 
wonderful crowds Thursday and Fri
day. Drake thought fewer people 
came due to the cold weather.
Drake said acts that performed in 
Grey Matter were packed, and shows 
like the a cappella singing group Dis
tinguished Gentlemen were stand
ing room only in the Wherrett Room.

The Student Government elections 
held during Carnival were marked by 
slightly increased participation, accord
ing to unofficial results published Fri
day.
About 12.3 percent of eligible students 
voted, or 882 out of 7,181. Voters re
jected Student Senates plus/minus grad
ing proposal and elected junior and cur
rent Student Government Treasurer 
Declan McCullagh president.
The elections were held from Wednes
day, April 13 through Friday, April 15. 
Senate seats in CFA, CIT, GSIA, the 
Heinz school, H&SS, IM, MCS, SCS, 
and the Miscellaneous category were 
also filled.
In the presidential race, McCullagh 
received 361 votes, write-in candidate 
Merle Atkinson 176, and Cameron 
Brown 143.
I think that the students voted for the 
candidate they felt would best represent 
them, said McCullagh.
McCullaghs campaign promises fo
cused on working with the administra
tion to implement a CMU Shuttle route 
to Squirrel Hill, and finding space for 
Scotland Yard and Entropy when Skibo 
is tom down.
McCullagh feels that the success of his 
campaign revolved around making his 
name well-recognized on campus. He 
also stated that both of his opponents
had good platforms and 
that either would have 
done well in the office.
McCullagh said that he 
hopes his constituents 
feel free to email him at 
declan@cmu.edu.
Merle Atkinson, run
ner-up in the campaign, 
said that all of the can
didates were competent 
politicians. Atkinson 
said that McCullagh will 
do a great job as presi
dent, but feels that a fo
cus on improving stu
dents attitudes will be 
imperative to serving 
the campus community.
Cameron Brown could 
not be reached for com
ment.
Voting on the plus/ 
minus grading referen
dum revealed that 121 
of the students who
voted are in favor of plus/minus. One praised the idea of holding elections

DoD plans inquiry into 
helicopters downing
WASHINGTON, April 15 (DJ)  
Defense Secretary William Perry said 
it will take weeks to sift through the 
evidence to figure out why two U.S. 
fighters shot down two Army helicop
ters over northern Iraq.
But, he said, We have already made 
some changes in the procedures there, 
which he said he could not reveal for 
security reasons.
Perry, making the rounds of net
work morning news shows, said he 
was baffled by the incident in which 
the U.S. Black Hawk helicopters were 
mistaken for Iraqi Hind helicopters.
I find it very difficult to under
stand, Perry said. The helicopters do 
not look very much like each other."
Perry said the F-15C pilots made 
two passes to visually inspect the he
licopters but did not attempt to con
tact them by radio before openingfire. 
Such radio contact was not part of 
their procedures, Perry said.
When asked if the pilots may have 
overreacted because of mounting ten
sions in Iraq, Perry said, There have 
been provocations in the past, but there 
was nothing that would have made 
this day stand out in particular.
Were continuing the operations in 
northern Iraq, but we have made some 
adjustments to ourprocedures... which 
take the hair trigger off to a certain 
extent, Perry told AP Network News.
Asked how such a tragedy could oc
cur, Perry replied, There were errors. 
There were human errors, probably, 
and there might be process or system 
errors as well.
White House search for 
court nominee difficult
WASHINGTON, April 15 (DJ)  
Uninspired by a short list of federal 
judges, President Bill Clinton is ex
panding his Supreme Court prospects 
in an effort to land a political figure 
capable of reshaping the bench.
That could bode well for lawyerstumed-politicians, such as Senantor 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), and House 
Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.).
He still wants a political type. Hes 
not ruling anybody out, certainly not 
the judges, but he really wants some
one with a political background, said 
a White House official involved in the 
search, who spoke on condition of ano
nymity.
Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell (D-Maine), fit the bill until he 
withdrew from consideration Tuesday. 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who 
is a former governor of Arizona, said 
earlier he was not interested in the 
job. New York Governor Mario Cuomo 
and Education Secretary Richard 
Riley, a former South Carolina gover
nor, told Clinton last year they didnt 
want to be considered.
Whats left is an ever-changing list 
of 10 to 12 candidates, who are mostly 
judges with superb legal credentials 
but have not yet turned Clintons head 
as he seeks a replacement for retiring 
Justice Harry Blackmun.
Clintons list is said to include U.S.
District Judge Jose Cabranes of Con
necticut. The Puerto Rico native was 
passed over recently for an appeals 
court vacancy but is a top contender 
now.
Solicitor General Drew S. Days III 
would appeal to Clintons interest in 
appointing a black justice.
Clinton is also considering Appeals 
Court Judge Richard Arnold, a highly 
respected judge from Arkansas. Al
ready accused of cronyism, Clinton 
would run into trouble tapping an old 
friend from his home state.
Appeals Court Judge AmalyaKearse 
of New York, who has a moderate to 
liberal judicial record, would be the 
first black woman named to the court.
Clintons staff also is looking at fed
eral appeals court Judges Gilbert 
Merritt of Nashville, Tennesee, 
Stephanie Seymour of Tulsa, Okla
homa, Patricia Wald of Washington, 
and Stephen Breyer of Boston. Breyer 
was edged out for a court seat last year 
by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who replaced 
Thurgood Marshall.
The search, which is still in its early 
stages, is headed by a small team of 
aides, including Chief of Staff Mack 
McLarty, Deputy Chief of Staff Phil 
Lader, senior adviser Bruce Lindsey, 
counsel Lloyd Cutler, deputy counsel 
Joel Klein, and Vickie Raad, another 
White House attorney.

Tobacco CEOs fight Congress
WASHINGTON, April 14 (DJ)Chief 
executives of seven of the nations larg
est tobacco companies uniformly denied 
that nicotine is addictive.
In testimony before a House subcom
mittee, the chief executives rebutted 
scientific data from the surgeon general, 
the World Health Organization, the 
American Medical Association, and other 
health groups that claim nicotine is an 
addictive substance and can lead to seri
ous health problems.
Representative Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), asked each of the executives indi
vidually if they thought nicotine was an * 
addictive substance, and each executive 
answered no. Kathy Ellis, director of 
research for Philip Morris USA, a unit of 
Philip Morris Companies, said the sci
entific evidence available is not clear on 
the issue of nicotine addiction.
Subcommittee chair Henry Waxman 
(D-Calif.) said he found it unbelievable 
that the witnesses could all disagree 
with such overwhelming evidence of 
tobaccos addictiveness. This really 
raises a question of credibility. Who else 
is on your side? he asked.
Clinton: U.S. will stay in Iraq
WASHINGTON, April 15 (DJ)  De
spite the accidental downing by friendly 
fire of two U.S. helicopters yesterday, 
President Bill Clinton said the U.S. 
should continue its involvement in 
United Nations peacekeeping activities 
in Iraq.
At an impromptu question and an
swer session with reporters, Clinton was 
asked if the US should continue its par
ticipation in the Iraq peacekeeping ef
fort. I think so, said Clinton. Our 
policy should continue.
The tragedy of this is that both sets of 
planes  the two helicopters and the 
two planes  were there trying to save 
the lives of the Kurds, said Clinton. I 
think [the operation] has performed a 
very valuable function.
He said the operation enabled Kurds 
to continue living in Iraq and alleviated 
a large potential immigration problem 
for Turkey.
Clinton said the U.S. will review the 
tactical issues involved in the U.S. 
presence there, but added that the mis
sion itself should continue.
However, Clinton appeared to ac
knowledge that his national security 
staff is preparing a policy on U.S. in
volvement in peacekeeping missions, 
saying, I do think we have to have 
higher standards.
The President stopped short of shift
ing the balance of the war in favor of the 
Bosnians.
The U.S. has no interest in NATO 
becoming involved in this war to give 
advantage to one side or the other, 
Clinton said.
Fed mulls hike in interest rates
NEW YORK, April 15 (DJ)  Despite 
a lack of signs of accelerating inflation, 
the Federal Reserve is considering rais
ing short-term interest rates again, The 
New York Times reported today.
Low short-term rates already have 
encouraged too much lending to boost 
the economy that is already on its recov
ery course, the newspaper said, citing 
interviews with Fed officials.
The paper did not quote any Fed offi
cials directly.
According to the Times, the Fed offi
cials still feel uncomfortable with the 
current strong showings of economic 
growth which would eventually lead to 
inflation, although privately the offi
cials have let it be known that they do 
not see imminent signs of accelerating 
inflation.
The Federal Reserve officials aim to 
maintain a neutral policy rather than a 
stimulative one, the paper said, citing 
Congressional testimony and interviews 
over the past two weeks.
The Federal Reserves so-called neu
tral policy means that investors may not 
be encouraged by monthly inflation re
ports which continue to show that cur
rent price increases are modest, the 
Times reported.
Despite the positive data, the central 
bank is leaning toward raising short
term interest rates, the paper said.
The stock and bond market fell sharply 
after the Federal Reserve raised rates 
twice in the first quarter.
Mustang owners celebrate cars
NEW YORK, April 15 (DJ)  Not 
every Ford Mustang on the face of the 
earth will be in Charlotte, N.C., this 
weekend. It will just seem that way.
Some 3,000 of the popular roadsters, 
accompanied by 10,000 owners and
50,000 spectators, will crowd into the 
citys Motor Speedway for whats being 
billed as the largest gathering ever of 
Mustang fans. The reason: a celebration 
of the 30th birthday of the vehicle, un
veiled at the Worlds Fair in New York 
on the same April weekend in 1964.
Car buffs, of course, are known for 
their devotion to their respective autos. 
But this particular gathering, according 
to some, is pushing the definition of the 
word loyalty into uncharted territoThese guys would give up their wife 
and kids before their Mustang, said Bill 
Dillard, president of the Mustang Club 
of America, and owner of a 1989 convert
ible.
Start with the distances some of the 
participants are traveling. A caravan of 
500 vintage models is windingits way to 
the party from Sacramento, Calif. Cars 
are also being shipped from Australia, 
Europe, and Japan. Some owners started 
overhauling their cars when George 
Bush was still President, just to get 
ready for this weekend.
Once there, they will drink beer, ogle 
restoration jobs, and talk tubular ex
haust headers and oversized throttle 
bodies. They will swap horror stories of 
loose engine parts, rusty undersides, 
trunks the size of a shoebox, and con
vertible roofs that would never be mis
taken for umbrellas. (They leak like 
sieves, says Mr. Deale.) And they will 
dine on a birthday cake covering an 
original, fullsized 19641/2 Mustang.
As part of the show, Ford will roll out 
its top Mustang fanatic, Chairman Alex 
Trotman, to thank the fans and hype 
Fords new Mustang. One special guest 
scheduled to attend: President Bill 
Clinton, proud owner of a 1968 convert
ible. His Mustang, however, will remain 
in a museum in Little Rock, Ark.
First family files its tax returns
WASHINGTON, April 15 (DJ) Bill 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton paid 
$62,670 in federal taxes on adjusted 
gross income of $293,757 in 1993, ac
cording to tax returns released today.
The Clintons, like millions of other 
Americans, filed their taxes at the last 
minute.
The 1993 tax year marked the first 
time President Bill Clintons income ex
ceeded thaLof his wife, a corporate law
yer who had long been the familys main 
breadwinner.
Because of overpayments, the Clintons 
are entitled to a refund of $7,982, their 
returns showed.
A year ago, the Clintons paid $70,228 
on income of $290,697.
Most of that was Rodham' Clintons 
salary as an attorney at the Rose Law 
Firm in Little Rock. The firm, which she 
left after the presidential election, paid 
her $203,172in1992. In contrast, Clinton 
earned $34,527 in 1992 as governor of 
Arkansas.

been on the drawing board 
for quite some time. Proposed six 
years ago, the design was finaltwo years ago. From that 
point, Skibos destruction was 
imminent. It was known for cer
tain that the building would be 
coming down, Murphy said.
Last November, the Board of 
Trustees accepted the plan for 
the University Center.
Murphy then selected a Space 
Allocation Board to recommend 
which groups would get space in 
the Naval Reserve Center. Most 
of the organizations that re
quested space got it, he said. The 
recommendations were given to 
Murphy and approved in Febru
aryThe NRC has been undergoing 
renovations in preparation for its 
opening in early May. [Its] lookingreal good, said Tom Murphy, 
associate director of physical 
plant for construction. According 
to Tom Murphy, the building has 
been 98 percent carpeted and an
occupancy permit will be applied 
for this week.
There have been additions to 
the building such as phone lines 
and computer hook-ups; two dark
rooms were built, some walls were 
tom down and others were built, 
and some of the lighting was re
done.
I think things are running 
smoothly, said Gorman. Were 
not running into any problems.
The Naval Center will serve as 
a temporary location for most of 
its future occupants, except the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project, 
which will be permanently housed 
there.
In 1996, when the University 
Center opens, organizations will 
have to apply for space there as 
well.
There is more office space in 
the University Center than there 
is in Skibo or the Naval [Cen
ter], said Michael Murphy. He 
said that although the building is 
smaller then Skibo it is ad

Carnival endures rain, wind
CARNIVAL, from page 1
It wasnt weather, but an effort to 
avoid problems, that caused the Carni
val Committee to shut down early on 
Saturday.
Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia said that last year there was 
an awful lot of potential for some seri
ous physical confrontation, and this 
could be what influenced the commit
tee to close early.
At 6:30 pm on Saturday everyone 
was cleared out of the Midway and the 
area was sealed off and guarded.
- Ticket sales for rides ended at 7:30 
pm and rides closed by 8 pm. The early 
closing had some patrons as well as 
organizations discouraged. When the 
bells rang at 6:30 signaling everyone to 
clear the Midway, there were cries of, 
That sucks, its closed already?
Jim Izzy Israel, Delta Tau Deltas 
booth chair, and a junior industrial 
design major, said the Carnival Com
mittee held a meeting with booth chairs 
to alert them of the early closing.
Israel was unhappy with the decision for 
two reasons. He said the booths provide 
entertainment for the community. People 
from counties all over Pennsylvania are
damages were.
Second, Israel said that the booth 
draws in the alumni and lets them feel 
what we have to offer. With all the 
time and effort each organization puts 
into their booth, Carnival should have 
been kept open longer, some said.
We spent half a semester for what? 
Two and a half days? said Israel.
Leslie Sgroi, a sophomore mechani
cal engineering major and sister at 
Delta Gamma, said the public is more 
disappointed [with closing early] than 
CMU.
Not everyone agreed. Lori Jurgovsky, 
a junior industrial management major 
and sister at Kappa Kappa Gamma, 
likes it better this way because it leaves 
more time for social aspects of Carni
val.
Students in ASA said If it werent 
for the weather, [theyd] want to con

might have kept people [from] coming 
into town Saturday night.

Senate extends benefits to gay partnerships '
At last Thursdays Faculty Senate 
meeting, the group voted overwhelm
ingly to extend domestic benefits to samesex couples.
The Senate proposal recommends that 
CMU adopt a plan similar to one in place 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology (MIT).
It called upon the administration and 
Board of Trustees to extend full and 
equal employment benefits to domestic 
partners of same-sex couples.
The vote was not unanimous, with one
Senator voting against the proposal.
The Faculty Senate resolution did not 
say when the changes should be imple
mented.
Financial aid deadlines fast approaching
Pennsylvania State Senator Michael 
Dawida (D-Allegheny) has an impor

ering them at an office in Skibo 
Hall and was now outside the 
police station in Baker Hall.
Two officers responded and 
found the man, who was not a 
CMU student, sitting on a bench
in front of Baker. The complaintants told the officers that the 
man had walked into the office 
with a can of beer. He offered 
them a drink. While they were 
not threatened, they feared he 
would try to drive home in his 
condition. They asked him to fol
low them to Baker under the pre
tense of getting him a ride.
The man told the officers that 
he had been on campus several 
times as part of events the orga
nization sponsored. He did not 
appear to be highly intoxicated. 
The man was informed that he 
was on private property and if he 
returned, he would be cited for 
trespassing.
4/12 MEDICAL EMER

Stadium garage, she began hav
ing back spasms. CMU EMS ar
rived on the scene, placed her on 
a back board, and attended to her 
in traffic van two until Pittsburgh 
Paramedics arrived. The victim 
was transported to the ambulance 
with the traffic van because the 
ambulance could not fit into the 
garage.
4/12 MEDICAL EMER
GENCY, 2:09 pm. A student 
stepped on a nail while building a 
Carnival booth. He was trans
ported to Presbyterian-University Hospital.
4/12 THEFT, 2:34 pm. A biol
ogy professor reported that two 
months ago, he had given one of 
his students a key to his lab. The 
student said that he was regis
tering for a class that required 
access to the room. The lab con
tained expensive office equipment 
and lab supplies. After the key 
was issued, the student stopped 
coming to the lab. The professor 
confronted the student, who said 
he had lost the key. The Regis
trar has no record of the student 
registering for the class.
A check of the C-Book revealed 
that no students by the name 
given to the professor were listed. 
The investigation is continuing.
4/13 MISSING PERSON, 3:55 
am. A West Wing resident phoned 
Campus Police to report that his 
roommate had been missing for 
two hours. He said the man had 
been feeling low. The depres
sion had set in because of con
cerns over school work. He felt 
that the student had probably 
gone to the Schenley Park area, 
where he often went to think.
The complaintant said that he 
did not feel his roommate would 
do anything rash, but wanted 
Campus Police to find him and 
check on his well-being. A de
scription of the person was broad
cast to all personnel.
At 5:24 am the man was seen in 
Doherty Hall. An officer ap
proached the man to see if he was 
okay, and he said he was fine. A 
few minutes later, his roommate 
called to say that he had returned 
to their room.
The Tartan prints the weekly 
Crime and Incident Report under 
the following guidelines:
 Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all Campus 
Police reports prior to release to 
The Tartan.
 Only three people on The Tar

Move must not burden 
students unnecessarily
Letters to the Editor
We are disappointed that cur
rent residents of Skibo will be 
required to vacate the premises 
in a higgledy-piggledy fashion. 
Organizations with offices in 
Skibo will have to move before 
May 15.
The reason, of course, is that 
there is a full month of school 
left in which they will be re
quired to continue operations. 
It is also the busiest month of 
any academic semester  final 
projects, term papers, and the
ses are due. Not to mention fi
nal exams. Organizational lead
ers are expected to conclude the 
affairs of their groups for the 
year, pass their courses success
fully, and begin sorting the 
groups accumulated detritus 
into moving crates.
This is a lot to ask of student 
volunteers, and the administra
tion was warned some time ago 
that this would happen. The 
needs of the people being af
fected by a major decision were 
ignored in favor of meeting an 
artificially imposed constraint. 
The University wants to finally 
make good on its promise to tear 
down Sldbo, and has decided to 
do it immediately after Com
mencement, whether sufficient 
time is built into the schedule or 
not. While we applaud the fact 
that the brass seem deter
mined to get the University Cen
ter construction underway,
Its your future so hopefully 
you did something about it when 
you had the chance. The refer
endum held in accordance with 
student government election 
offered three choices on the sub
ject of plus/minus grading: none 
at all, for everyone, or just for 
new students.
The last choice seems com
pletely senseless. Current stu
dents should not be making de
cisions for future students. If 
the administration is consider
ing plus/minus grading for fu
ture students, it ought to ques
tion those people - i.e. prospec
tive freshmen. Counting on cur
rent students to vote in the best 
interests of others when they 
know that they themselves will 
not be affected by their decision 
is foolish. This would be equiva
lent to asking a government to 
approve of going to war when 
they wouldnt have to fight in it.
There are both theoretical and 
practical reasons as to why plus/ 
minus grading would prove det
rimental to the university and 
the student body.
First of all, at this level of 
education, one should be able to 
expect just that, education. 
Whereas grades are important 
because they serve as an index 
for students learning, they are 
just a necessary evil. QPAs are 
simply numbers that allow em
ployers and schools to compare 
students. However, this num
ber only needs to convey a gen
erality, not a precise report of 
every grade ever earned since 
grades are so relative to the 
student and college and are not 
consistent throughout the Uniwere concerned that the move 
is about to become a mess.
One wonders why this impor
tant aspect of the project is be
ing done with such haste. After 
all, weve been waiting for a new 
student activities center since 
the mid-1980s. Why, then, must 
the move be pushed through 
with little apparent regard for 
the hardship[p it will place on 
organizations? Will wrecking 
cranes be standing by during 
the graduation ceremonies, 
ready to take their first swing at 
the building when the last di
ploma is handed out?
Its not to late to extend the 
deadline for the move. Clubs 
should be given more time after 
final exams to move into their 
new locations. Most groups will 
be shorthanded, as students re
turn home to begin their sum
mer jobs or work on their tans. 
A select few individuals will be 
under a lot of pressure to com
plete the moving process.
We would ask the administra
tion to delay the demolition a 
week or two in order to lighten 
the burden slightly. Very little 
harm could come from padding 
the schedule to allow more 
breathing room.
In the meantime, wed recom
mend that student leaders be
gin measuring those doorways 
and cataloging those paper
weights.
versity.
At the university level, educa
tion ought to be more important 
than grades, since the quality of 
work often has nothing to do 
with a number. By installing 
plus/minus grading, the admin
istration would only emphasize 
that the manipulation of the 
numbers system is more impor
tant than what students actu
ally learn.
On a practical level, plus/mi
nus grading would most likely 
result in lower QPAs for CMU 
students. With plus/minus grad
ing, the most exceptional stu
dents, those who usually earn 
As, would witness their QPA 
drop. Not to mention the stu
dents who are strugglingwill 
this affect them even more so?
It seems that every year CMU 
has to deal with a very low re
tention rate. It doesnt seem that 
adding plus/minus grading will 
help that situation at all.
As a matter of fact, it might be 
a good idea for CMU to consider 
other grading systems that 
might be more fair. Doing away 
with a grading system and mov
ing to a complete written evalu
ation is just one of the many 
ideas CMU could consider.
The administration ought to 
think carefully about intention
ally installing a system that will 
harm its students. Most univer
sities claim that they are wellequipped to prepare students to 
succeed in the world. There 
would be an odd sort of irony if 
Carnegie Mellon ended up pur
posely hurting its students 
chances for success by enforcing 
plus/minus grading.
Media blitz hurts professor
Editor:
After reading the 
articles about profes
sor Tim Satemows 
harassment charges 
[Professor blasts 
media; Alleged harassment recounted, 
4/11], I am saddened by the amazing 
success of Patrick Mooney, the accused 
student, in drawing attention away from 
his offense: restricting freedom of speech 
by removing a poster advertising an 
AIDS awareness film. Mooney is cer
tainly entitled to disagree with Satemow 
or anyone else about gay rights, AIDS 
awareness, or religious beliefs. But he is 
not permitted by University statute or 
constitutional law to prevent another 
person or group from exercising their 
freedom of speech. The alleged harass
ment came in response to Satemows 
attempts to defend one of our most sa
cred legal principles and prevent the 
removal of the poster. There is no ques
tion that Mooney did finally remove the 
poster.
Yet, rather than applaud Saternows 
action, several prominent members of 
the media have joined in attacking him 
based on his sexual orientation, and 
some religious groups have targeted him 
for abuse. Its ironic that those with the 
most to lose by suppression of free speech 
are complicitous in these attacks. As 
usual, no good deed goes unpunished.
Satemows sexual orientation is ex
clusively his business. The aesthetic 
merit of the poster in question is a mat
ter of personal taste. But what matters 
most and receives the least attention in 
this case is Mooneys attempt to prevent 
cmuOUTs presentation from being at
tended. If Mooney or any other group 
wishes to disagree with the views of 
cmuOUT, there are ample forums for 
peaceful discussion and debate avail
able. They are also forms of our first 
amendment right to freedom of speech.

Students defend drama professor
Editor:
We appreciate The 
Tartan allowing Tim 
Satemow the oppor
tunity to give his ex
planation of the ha
rassment issue as printed in The Tartan 
last week [Alleged harassment re
counted, 4/11]. This was the first time 
we had heard of this issue, and we were 
shocked by what we read.
We find Patrick Mooneys opinion that 
Satemow was immature and unable to 
defend his beliefs humorous and in
valid. Although we do not know all of the 
details surrounding this case, we are 
saddened that Mooney apparently does 
not respect the policy of confidentiality 
expected in these matters. We also find 
Mooneys actions, especially supplying 
the Associated Press with an unbalanced 
story, inexcusable. And we condemn the 
media for indulging Mooneys self-im
portance and allowing extreme viola
tion of Saternows privacy.
As drama students we know Satemow 
as a teacher, an advisor, and a friend. He 
is an extremely valuable member of the 
Drama Department faculty. We com
mend Satemow for trying to walk away 
from an inflammatory argument, for en
forcing University policy, and for stand
ing up for his beliefs in a proper forum. 
We applaud you, Tim, for your strength 
of character, and your dignified compo
sure throughout this ordeal.

CMU failed to protect victim
Editor:
I was disturbed by 
the recollections of 
the freshman wit
ness in your story 
[Alleged harass
ment recounted, 4/11]. His quote that 
the professor who had witnessed the 
illegal removal of the poster would walk 
away when things were being said is 
particularly frightening.
It seems to me that people have the 
fundamental right to walk away from 
disputes. The student charged with ha
rassment has characterized the incident 
as a debate, but a debate requires will
ing participants. There is no willingness 
when a person is walking away. Yet the 
chiding of this witness while he was 
walking away continued throughout the 
length of Baker Hall.
Carnegie Mellon is spending tens of 
thousands of dollars in the name of secu
rity to lock down Doherty and Wean. 
However, CMU is apparently unable or 
unwilling to protect members of this 
community when they witness rules 
being broken.

Readers dispute article's facts
Editor:
We would like to 
congratulate Declan 
McCullagh for writ
ing two of the most 
biased articles we 
have ever read in The Tartan [Profes
sor blasts media; Alleged harassment 
recounted, 4/11]. His two articles re
garding the Pat Mooney incident con
tained many falsehoods, and his ap
proach was very one-sided. We actually 
witnessed the alleged harassment and 
the University Disciplinary Committee 
hearing. McCullagh relied primarily on 
the account of Tim Satemow, whose 
comments were full of emotions, but 
lacking in facts.
McCullagh writes, a Catholic student 
harassed him by shouting anti-gay com
ments. The student, Mooney, was not 
harassing Satemow, and he was not 
shouting anti-gay comments. They were 
both engaged in a spirited debate re
garding the Churchs stance on homo
sexuality. It is interesting to see how
quickly McCullagh passes judgment on 
Mooney, since the UDC found him not 
guilty of harassment. Does McCullagh ; 
have more information and insight than 
the UDC?
McCullagh cites the continued ha
rassment that Satemow has received. 
Satemow said, I am angry that nothing 
is being done to the student about the 
harassment after the fact. He caused 
the phone calls, the incorrect news reports. Since there was no harassment 
in the first place, the harassment that 
Satemow received from the press was 
not continued. Mooney never prompted 
any press releases out; rather, he simply 
responded to the press when it con
tacted him. Mooney, in respect of the 
campus confidentiality policy, has not 
personally spoken with any member of 
the media, including The Tartan, in the 
last few weeks. A house mate of Mooney 
contacted the press when charges were 
filed against Mooney. McCullagh writes, 
Thats when [Satemow] says senior... 
Patrick Mooney started yelling at him, 
shouting anti-gay remarks like, Why do 
you guys have to bash the Church?  
Mooney simply asked Satemow, Why 
do you guys have to bash the church? 
That is surely not an anti-gay remark; 
and neither is the remark that Satemow 
claims Mooney to have said!
What McCullagh describes as a bright 
pink triangle on Satemows backpack 
was not noticeable at all. Mooney did not 
know Satemow, so how could he have 
known he was gay? McCullagh quotes 
Dan Goldwasser as saying, In the con
text of the argument that followed, 
Mooney may have used the word homo
sexual, but not in any derogatory way. 
Goldwasser intended this quote to show 
that if he had used the word, it was not 
demeaning, andnotdirectedatSaternow, 
but rather in describing the Churchs 
position on the issue at hand.
Given McCullaghs knowledge of the 
historically confidential disciplinary 
charges, he should have known that 
Mooney could not speak to him. 
Satemow, who whines incessantly about 
the confidentiality code, had no problem 
providing McCullagh with a plethora of 
comments.
If McCullagh really wanted a com
ment from an alternative viewpoint, he 
could have contacted Todd Olson, whom 
McCullagh claims never to have heard 
of until recently. We are sure that if 
McCullagh made a concerted effort of 
researching this article, he would have 
discovered that Olson was not only one 
of four witnesses to the event, but he was 
also charged by cmuOUT for removing 
the poster. Multiple times McCullagh 
states that Mooney declined to speak to 
The Tartan. Mooney was in Washing
ton, D.C., over the weekend that 
McCullagh was writing the article, and 
even if Mooney was in town, he would 
have been unable to speak to McCullagh 
because the University has imposed a 
gag order on Mooney.
It is upsetting to read an article so 
filled with falsehoods and misinforma
tion in our official campus newspaper, 
The Tartan. As McCullagh is a member 
of cmuOUT, allowing him to write this 
article seems to be a conflict of interest. 
We hope that next time, The Tartan 
chooses will choose someone who will 
research the topic to its fullest, and give 
the CMU community a story that pre
sents fact and truths, not statements

Columnist imagines brave new world
David Hunt
The worst form of government is democracy, until one considers the others. How
ever, the most efficient form of govern
ment is a dictatorship. Here are some idle 
mu sings about what Id do if I had absolute 
power in the U.S. for the next 10 years.
Government staffing is cut by 25 per
cent over five years. All programs receive 
intense scrutiny, and the National En
dowment for the Arts dies on a four year 
linearly decreasing plan, to name one pro
gram. Economic aid to foreign countries 
ceases on a five year plan, as will all 
agricultural subsidies. All federal law en
forcement is restructured. Social Security 
doesnt exist for persons bom after the 
year 1999. You are responsible for your 
retirement. Those still eligible will cost 
the government money, but Im looking at 
the long view.
Income taxes are revamped into a con
sumption tax; i.e., a sliding national sales 
surtax. Interest on savings is tax free to a 
principal of one million dollars. The capi
tal gains tax is repealed. All corporate 
R&D money spent is 50 percent deductible 
from corporate income, and if a successful 
product is brought to market, a 25 percent
additional tax credit on the R&D expendi
tures is granted. Employee training is de
ductible, and companies can borrow at below-market rates for training, new facili
ties, and new equipment. Companies re
ceive a tax credit based on the percentage of 
American labor used.
Marijuana is legalized in the first year, to 
be sold through licensed dealers. In the 
third year cocaine, heroin, and LSD are 
added to the legal list. All are highly taxed. 
Revenues from these sources will fund ur
ban renewal projects primarily employing 
welfare recipients, education programs for 
those wishing to use drugs, and rehabilita
tion programs for those who cant use them 
responsibly.
Welfare recipients not working in urban 
renewal will be given the option of going to 
school or working in less demanding occupa
tions. Free day care centers which use wel
fare recipients as staff will enable other 
welfare parents to work or attend school. A 
time limit of five years is put on benefits 
unless compelling need is shownpersons 
demonstrably unable to do any work will be 
supported in dorm-style housing.
Gasoline taxes are raised on a scale corre
sponding to the grade, with the rates in
creasing 10 percent each year. If you can pay 
for a BMW and use ultra, you can pay 25 
cents extra per gallon. Revenues go to in
creased public transportation and into na
tional infrastructure such as highways, seaand airports, railroads, and information 
networks.
All gun control laws save the licensing 
of fully automatic weapons are repealed, 
with a national non-discretionary con
cealed carry permit. Instant checks are 
mandated for those wishing to buy fire
arms, but no gun registration exists. Twotime convicted murderers and three-time 
rapists are put against a wall and shot. 
Prisons are refurbished to be hard time. 
Those capable of working will do so, with 
profits from their labors going to a victims 
reparation fund, as will the illegally-got
ten gains of white-collar criminals.
Space exploration, development, and 
other high science and technology endeav
ors are put on top priority, with anti-trust 
laws weakened to allow multi-corporation 
and multi-national cooperation. Military 
paperwork and benefits are turned over to 
civilian firms, and procurement rules are 
relaxed to encourage competitiveness and 
dual-use production. Emphasis is placed 
onto conflict support logistics. Weaponry 
advances continue, especially in force-mul
tiplying technologies. Emphasis is placed 
on force projection and rapid deployment 
rather than large in-place armies. Gays 
are allowed in the military, and have full 
marital rights everywhere.
Environmental laws are strengthened. 
Recycling becomes mandatory, with an 
R&D effort to achieve minimal use of new
raw materials. Material collection and 
sorting suggest another place for wel
fare employment. Corporations using 
recycled materials in products receive 
tax credits. Environmental and popula
tion control aid is offered to other coun
tries ideally through the U.N.with 
a view to reversing global population 
growth. Abortion remains legal as a 
part of that plan.
Juries can vote if a suit is frivolous. If 
so, the legal expenses of the defendant 
mustbe paidby the plaintiff, and charges 
maybe filed for unnecessary suits. Prod
uct liability is restructured under a rea
sonable person standard; i.e., if the 
jury believes that a reasonable person 
should have known there was a danger, 
the suit is dismissed.
Ideally, foreign trade is totally free. 
Countries that have demonstrably un
fair practices will find their products 
subject to tariffs. Human rights viola
tions are grounds for termination of 
trade privileges. Warring nations must 
be dealt with firmly and swiftly under 
the UN aegis.
There will be those who think Im 
wrong. Thats fine. I dont care, so long 
as you do what youre told.
David Hunt is a mechanical engineer
ing graduate student who doubts any of 
the above will happen. Sigh.

These facts are not altered by

Compromising ones ethics in 
the name of convenience or to 
maintain social and professional 
networks has historically al
lowed the masses to sit by and 
allow horrors such as the Holo
caust in Nazi Germany. All it 
takes for evil to triumph is for 
good people to do nothing; it is 
difficult to view eating meat as 
benign after watching an ani
mal being beaten into the slaugh

into the air, and her throat slit. 
While it may be well-hidden from

as well. We may feel better to use 
labels such as extreme or

change our complicity.
The contention that eating ani

even more absurd rationalization 
than the Beavis excuse they taste

the carcasses of other animals. 
Indeed, what could possibly be 
more important and meaningful 
than living an examined life ac
cording to principles?
Presenting the facts behind the 
meat on ones plate and refuting 
excuses makes the assumption, 
obviously not shared by all, that 
the readers are reasonable and 
rational. Saying that the readers 
of The Tartan are unable or un
willing to question their habits, 
traditions, and real lives, and: 
are thus unable to discard an 
inhumane diet unless forced, pre
cludes speaking with them as in
telligent or thoughtful individu
als.
If we are unable to think be
yond our societys traditions and 
habits, and if we are unwilling to 
act with a modicum of morality 
and concern beyond our own in
terests, we are not placing our
selves above the other animals, 
but below them.

Researchers lack ethics
=*r
Matt Ball
It was recently revealed that 
people from across the country, 
including poor women seeking 
promised prenatal care, were 
injected with or otherwise ex
posed to radiation without their 
consent. In other experiments, 
subjects were exposed to LSD 
or mustard gas. Given that 
many of the records for some of 
the revealed experiments have 
been destroyed, it is possible 
that more government experi
ments, perhaps with even worse 
outcomes, willnever be exposed.
Not everyone reacted with 
outrage to this expos: some of 
the scientists alive today still 
defend putting the lives of inno
cents in jeopardy. Patricia 
Durbin, one of the researchers 
involved in one of the radiation 
experiments, defendedthe stud
ies in an interview earlier this 
year by saying, Maybe we 
skirted ethics a little, but not 
much.
This reaction is a useful re
minder of the vision-distorting 
nature of the scientific pursuit 
of truth. While it is easy to 
think that only sadists and 
monsters were involved in the 
horrors of the Nazi concentra
tion camps, the fact is that many 
high-ranking and world-renowned doctors took part, in
cluding the head of the German 
Red Cross. History has consis
tently and regrettably shown 
that scientists cannot be ex
pected to regulate themselves 
ethically. (See books like Hu
man Guinea Pigs, by Dr. M. 
Pappworth.)
More frightening is the atti
tude leading several reports con
cerning the mustard gas and 
LSD experiments in this coun
try. Some in the media took the 
general tone of, While the ra
diation experiments may have 
benefitted all Americans.... This 
twisted utilitarian judgment 
reveals a frightening lack of re
spect for the individual which, 
when followed, has had devas
tating consequences for those 
not in a position to defend them
selves against the more power
ful.
The failure of utilitarianism 
 providing the greatest good 
for the greatest number  can 
be seen in a hypothetical but 
possible situation. Two infants, 
the children of a rich and power
ful family, are in need of trans
plants or they will certainly die. 
In the same hospital, a healthy 
but retarded child has just been 
bom to an illegal immigrant and 
put up for adoption. This latter 
child, with none of the prospects 
of the former two, could be sac
rificed for the greater good and 
used for spare parts to save the 
rich infants lives. Would this 
sacrifice be acceptable, moral, 
or right?
Relative to the two infants who 
are dying, the handicapped child 
may not be intelligent, creative, 
able to enter moral contracts, or 
even valued by others. However, 
disregarding irrelevant and di
visive labels such as foreign, 
poor, black, pagan, etc., all 
the children have a single mor
ally relevant quality in common: 
they are sentient  able to feel 
pleasure and pain  and from 
this they have an innate desire 
to continue to live.
While with the right amount 
of money and influence it would
be quite possible to kill the 
abandoned infant (died of 
complications... ) for the ben
efit of the other two, any per
son who claims to believe in an 
ethic beyond might makes 
right should respect the in
herent value of another sen
tient being, and thus refuse to 
sacrifice (kill) this being for 
the possible benefit of others. 
This respect should be granted 
regardless of the individuals 
power, intelligence, or value to 
others. Granting respect 
doesnt mean that the handi
capped orphan is more im
portant than the two dying 
infants; the lives of sentient 
beings cannot be ranked in 
some ethical equation.
Yet does this respect exist in 
todays society?
Many researchers are sadly 
lacking in any philosophy that 
respects an autonomous sen
tient life. Worse than that, 
however, is the frightening fact 
that reporters and others, re
moved in time and class from 
the victims of these radiation 
experiments, are able to ex
cuse the poisoning of innocent 
individual beings, who un
suspectingly came to doctors 
seeking care for their unborn 
children, only to be given doses 
of radiation to benefit the 
masses.
It is important that we as a 
society and as individuals re
spect, separate from how their 
exploitation may benefit us, 
the lives of all sentient beings, 
no matter how poor, unintelli
gent, or unvalued they may be 
relative to us.

Track team spends busy week in Burgh
CMU women dominate visitors at home
By ANUJ GUPTA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Last Wednesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens track team 
hosted the CMU Womens Invi
tational in Gesling Stadium.
The attending teams were Rob
ert Morris College, Duquesne 
University, Grove City College, 
Bethany College, Wheeling Je
suit College, and the University 
of Pittsburgh-Johnstown.
All around it was a good day for 
the Tartan women, as eight 
women had performances which 
placed them in the top five in 
their respective events, and sev
eral others had performances to 
help round out the top 12 in their 
events.
The stars for the CMU women 
were senior Mary Moore and
freshman Leslie Brown, as both 
of them posted first place fin
ishes. Moore placed first in the 
shot put with a throw of 34'6", 
and Brown won the discus throw 
with a mark of 108'3".
Moore and Brown also contin
ued their impressive showing in 
the field events. Moore took third 
overall in the high jump at a 
height of 4'8", and Brown took 
fourth in the shot put with a mark 
of 30'2.25".
But Moore and Brown werent 
the whole show, as there were 
many other fine performances to 
go along with theirs.
Freshman Rebecca Buchheit 
finished fourthin the 1,500-meter 
run with a time of 5:22.6, and 
took ninth in the 800-meter run 
with a time of 2:39.1. Another 
freshman, Saratu Mohammed,
took third in the 400-meter dash 
with a time of 1:06.0.
Other stars in running events  
included freshman Audry 
McAfee, who finished fifth in the 
400-meter dash with a time of 
1:09.5; sophomore Melissa 
Baustert, who took second in the 
800-meter run with a mark of 
2:18.7; freshman Mahalynn Lu, 
who took 10th in the 800-meter 
run with a 2:41.4 mark; senior 
Jodi Piccolo, who finished 12th in 
the 800-meter run at a 2:43.3 
clip; and sophomore Stephanie 
Stine who finished eighth in the 
200-meter dash with a time of 
:29.8.
CMU women continued to 
dominate throughout the day on 
the track and in the field.
There were many fine perfor
mances including the following:
Freshman Penny Summerville 
took second in the javelin with a 
throw of 127'.50". Freshman 
Theresa Giacommino took fifth 
in the javelin with a mark of 
97'11"; junior Jenny Gretz took 
eighth in the javelin with a throw 
of 8810.5"; and sophomore Crys
tal Espinoza did well in two events 
as she took sixth in the shot put 
with a throw of 27'9" and fourth 
in the discus throw with a mark 
of 81'3.5".
The Tartan mens and womens 
teams continued to tune up for 
UAAs as they competed at the 
University of Pittsburgh yester
day.
Next weekend the Tartans will 
travel to Emory University in 
Atlanta for the UAA champion
ships. The team has two meets 
after that.

Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The mens and womens track 
teams competed at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh yesterday. The 
competition was extremely diffi
cult due to the large number of 
Division I schools there, but it 
was a good last meet before 
UAAs, womens coach Dario 
Donatelli said.
Individual highlights for the 
womens team include freshman 
Leslie Browns discus throw of 
118'6". This new school record for 
Brown put her in fifth place. 
Sophomore Missy Baustert had 
her best race of the year in the 
400-meter hurdles. She came ex
tremely close to qualifying for 
nationals with her time of 65.1.
It was fortunate that this meet 
was on Sunday after Spring Car
nival was over. Now were look
ing forward to Atlanta this week
end, hoping the weather will be 
better than what weve been com
peting in. Outside of a few inju
ries, I feel confident that we will 
do well, Donatelli said.
Predictions for UAAs favor se
nior Aliza Hildebrandt in the 
10,000-meter and 5,000-meter 
and Baustert in the 400-meter 
dash and400-meter hurdles. Also, 
Brown is expected to do well in 
the discus, hammer, and shot put, 
along with senior Mary Moore.
The mens team also did well
considering the level of competi
tion. We did as well as we could, 
coming off of Spring Carnival and 
the buggy races. A lot of the guys 
were involved in buggy. Ive been 
here since 1967 and every year as 
soon as Carnival is over, it usu
ally takes a little time for all 
those aches and pains to go away, 
mens coach Gary Meckley said.
Freshman Buck Neel came in 
first place in the 200-meters with 
a time of 22.5. This was his best 
time of the year, Meckley said. 
Also, in the 100-meters, Neel fin
ished well with a time of 10.8.
Graduate student Brad Shapiro 
placed third in the 800-meters at 
1:56.7 yesterday. Another out
standing performance was made
by sophomore E.J. Tsangaris in 
the hammer event with 21 feet as 
a new personal best. Tsangaris 
had another personal best in dis
cus, throwing it 143'7".
Junior Jim Filicko, who was 
previously out with an injury, 
came back to run the 100-meters 
in 11.1. The 4x100-meter mens 
relay team came in fourth place. 
The relay team consisted of se
nior Gary Long, freshmen Eric 
Limegrover and Neel, and senior 
Jarrod Siket. A personal best for 
senior Brandyn Woodard in the 
long jump was 217", putting him 
in second place.
Id like the team to regroup 
and get rid of all the damage 
Carnival did, Meckley said.
Rugby nets third at Johnstown
Team suffers first defeat of semester in tourney
By JUSTIN LAM
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon rugby club came in third 
place Saturday at the University of PittsburghJohnstown Blood Tournament.
The Tartans began to play with brutal deter
mination and dismantled Juniata College 310 
in the first round of the round-robin tourna
ment.
Senior Bill Lucier, junior John Crowley, and 
faculty member Ed Hanna all scored one try 
each. Sophomore Javier Rocha scored two tries, 
and freshman Larry Adams put in three skillful 
conversion kicks, despite the 60-miles-per-hour 
gusts of wind.
The second round was the most challenging 
for CMU, as they butted heads with the 
Westmoreland County Mens team, a non-collegiate foe, but lost 12-0.
The loss was the Tartans first this season 
after five consecutive wins against college oppo
nents.
Blessed with long-time veterans and massive 
physical size, the Westmoreland team was the 
most formidable opponent the Tartans have 
faced this season.
CMU tried to replicate past success against 
Westmoreland by playing a conservative and 
tight game.
The CMU back line tried to gain field position 
by kicking the ball up the field. This kicking 
proved aimless, given the wind.
The largest difference was the style of referee
ing during the match. A lot of calls were ex
tremely liberal. Penalties and turnovers that 
would otherwise be whistled down on the colle
giate level of play were not. While this style of 
officiating is more appropriate on the mens 
level, it really had no place in the collegiate 
tournament.
In turn, it made the straight-laced CMU at
tack much less effective, and Westmoreland 
took greater advantage of the loose refereeing 
than CMU.
In the consolation game for third place against 
the host school, senior Mike Keller and faculty 
member Doug Balog put in a try apiece to make 
the final score 12-0.
In the championship round, Westmoreland 
Mens destroyed Westminster College by the 
score of 43-0.
Still, CMU seemed to be one of the best colle
giate teams there and, if given the appropriate 
refereeing, could have been the champions, ac
cording to many players.
We were, at the very least, the second place 
team there. We had the strongest showing of all 
the teams there, Rocha said after the tourna
ment.
That proved true, as last week the Tartans 
trounced Westminster College 32-3 back in Pitts
burgh.
Overall, CMU has to be pleased with its 
progress, as they are now 111 against college 
teams this year, and 6-0 against all collegiate 
teams this semester. The team is 6-1 overall 
this semester.
Next week, CMU takes on Bethany College at 
home.

This season brings changes to baseball
The Suicide Squeeze
By Anuj Gupta
Being the traditionalist that I 
am, it is still hard to look at the 
Major League standings day in, 
day out, and see six divisions in 
front of my face instead of the 
regular four. It is also hard to 
imagine that two teams will not 
have to win their respective divi
sions in order to reach the 
postseason.
But in todays era of baseball 
where money does the talking 
and the labor union constantly 
talks of walking, the only thing 
average fans, such as you and 
me, can do is adapt to the changes.
There is nothing we can do to 
change the fact that eight teams 
will now make the playoffs, and 
that there will be no regular sea
son television broadcasts until
after the All-Star break. So we 
can start to look on the bright 
side of this mess, and realize that 
1994 may eventually be remem
bered as a very special year in 
baseball, for never in recent times 
has there been so many teams 
that have the ability to compete 
for the two newly created playoff 
spots  the wild card teams.
This is especially the case in 
the American League where it 
appears that at least eight teams 
(Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue 
Jays, New York Yankees, Detroit 
Tigers, Cleveland Indians, Chi
cago White Sox, Texas Rangers, 
and Seattle Mariners) will be com
peting for four playoff spots. Of 
course, three of those probable 
teams will win the three division 
titles, thus leaving five compet
ing for the final wild card spot, 
and dont forget those pesky Bos
ton Red Sox, and the apparently 
rejuvenated Milwaukee Brewers.
Although the quality of teams 
in the National League is a bit 
below that of the American 
League, there still remain seven 
teams (Atlanta Braves, Montreal 
Expos, Philadelphia Phillies, Cin
cinnati Reds, Houston Astros, San 
Francisco Giants, and Los Ange
les Dodgers) who have the ability 
to play ball in October. And 
though it is more likely than not 
that the Braves will win their 
division, the rest of the league is 
not as clear cut, thus leaving a 
good four teams who will be left 
to compete for the last wild card 
spot.
Fans must also try to envision 
the memorable moments that 
would be created if some 
Cinderella story wild card team 
somehow manages to make it to 
the Grand Finale, and take home 
an unexpected World Champion
ship.
So although the luster of win
ning a division has been some
what diminished, and many of 
the great rivalries of recent times 
have been lost to realignment, 
August and September of 1994 
may turn out to be the time of one 
of the greatest playoff races ever.
Yes, the winds of change are 
blowing through the baseball 
world at the present, but they 
dont necessarily have to be cold.
Sixty-six feet, six inches: Has
anybody noticed that the average 
box score in the first two weeks of 
the season has borne more re
semblance to a line from* NFL 
Sunday rather than a typical 
Major League score? The lack of 
pitchingin todays era of baseball
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-Editor
has never been more apparent 
not even in the juiced-up ball 
year of 1987, and it was topped 
off by the recent Red Sox-Royals 
line which read 2211 in favor of 
the BoSox.
It wasnt just a strange premo
nition when I wrote in October 
that the score from game four of 
the 1993 World Series was a sign 
of things to come, for due to re
cent expansion there are at least 
22 pitchers who normally would 
not be in the major leagues right 
now. One must also realize that 
young arms are being rushed to 
the majors at an alarming rate, 
due to the fact that there just 
arent enough quality arms to go 
around.
Of course one can make an ar
gument with the Atlanta Braves 
in mind, but every dark cloud has 
a silver lining. Just how far could 
teams such as the Cubs and Ti
gers go if they only had three or 
four top quality arms to add to 
their repertoire?
The problem will only continue 
to worsen, for todays hitters just 
keep getting bigger and stronger, 
and as the fans long for offensive 
minded games, so goes the 
prioritization of the fundamen
tals of baseball. The backyard 
fathers and mothers who teach 
the stars of tomorrow must shift 
the emphasis from the bat to 
throwing strikes.
Of course, we could just move 
the mound up a little. How about 
44 feet, four inches?
Rolaids Relief Committee 
Award: What has happened to 
the days of the dominating closer? 
You remember Bobby Thigpen, 
Gregg Olson, Doug Jones, and 
even Dennis Eckersley  they 
arent the same any more. Of 
course we still have intimidators 
like Rod Beck, Duane Ward, 
Roberto Hernandez, etc., but as 
the quality of pitching continues 
to diminish, more teams find 
themselves going to a bullpen by 
committee (Cleveland Indians, 
Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee 
Brewers, Seattle Mariners, Phila
delphia Phillies, etc.).
It goes to show what the role of 
the bullpen actually entails  in 
no other position on the roster is 
there more turnover, for one can 
only throw so hard for so long. 
Maybe they should change the 
Rolaids Relief Man award to the 
Rolaids Relief Committee Award.

In Your Face
By Seth A. Covitz
All I have heard in the last week in the 
sports world is the continuous shuffling 
of NFL quarterbacks from team to team. 
This seems to shock people for some 
reason, and always seems to make the 
top headlines, but free agency has ex
isted in the NBA for quite some time 
now. Remember when you used to think 
your favorite team was building around 
their franchise superstar? Those were 
the days. Now if they dont produce, they 
get shipped out.
I remember hearing that Charles 
Barkley was being traded to Phoenix. I 
thought to myself, Wow! I never 
thought that would ever happen. Today 
it is commonplace. Do you remember 
that great Lakers team of years back? If 
you do, the only player that is still there 
is James Worthy. A.C. Green went to 
Phoenix, Byron Scott went to Indiana, 
Sam Perkins went to Seattle, and coach 
Pat Riley went to New York. How about 
the Bad Boys dynasty in Detroit? Save 
for Isaiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, ev
eryone else has either retired or been 
traded. Dennis Rodman went to San
Antonio, John Salley 
went to Miami, Rick 
Mahorn went to the 
Nets, Bill Laimbeer re
tired, as did the micro
wave, Vinne Johnson.
People ask themselves, 
why is Dallas so bad?
Free agency is again the 
answer. Franchise su
perstar Mark Aguire 
was traded to Detroit,
Derek Harper and 
Rolando Blackman are 
now with the Knicks, 
and Roy Tarpley is sus
pended for violation of 
the NBA drug policy.
So is this free agency 
thing supposed to work 
best for the fans, or the 
players? I am still 
searching for an answer 
to this one. First, lets 
say free agency works 
best for the fans. Try 
telling that to the fans 
in Philadelphia, who 
ended up settlingfor 7'6"
Shawn Bradley, the hu
man spectacle, to be 
their hero. And now that 
hes out for the season, save those tapes 
of last weeks win over the Knicks be
cause that will be their only highlight 
this season. What did the 76ers get in 
that trade? How about Jeff Homacek, 
who is now with the Utah Jazz, two noRon Kurti/Tartan Artist 
name players (you know Tim Perry and 
Andrew Lang, right?) and a future pick 
in the NBA draft. What did Phoenix get 
from the trade with Philly? How about 
some hope, a ticket to last years NBA 
finals and this years fourth-place spot
in the Western Conference. Chances are 
if something good doesnt happen soon, 
the remaining faces in Phoenix will just 
be shipped off again with the likes of 
Tom Chambers (ex-superstar), Eddie 
Johnson, and Jeff Homacek (boy, he 
gets traded often).
Lets now look at this issue from the 
players point of view. Try telling 
Dominque Wilkins to take a hike; dont 
expect him to be happy. He was: the 
staple of the Atlanta Hawks franchise 
for the last 12 years; still one of the top 
five scorers in the league even after 
rupturing his Achilles tendon; coming 
off his most well rounded statistical year 
as a Hawk; beginning a season that has 
made the Hawks the top team in the 
East; sent packing. The headlines in 
Atlanta should have displayed the single 
syllable three-letter word DIS. This 
switch seemed to be more like a scene 
out of the movie Trading Places, with 
Danny Manning being dragged out of 
the back alleys and given an NBA team 
with a future, while Nique, the human 
highlight film, was dropped into smoggy 
L.A. to start from scratch, again. Maybe 
the folks in the Atlanta front office just 
like that worst-to-first story fine so 
much that they decided what worked for 
the Braves could also work for Danny 
Manning. How does Manning respond 
to his being saved from the Clips of 
doom? He tells the Hawks and the public 
that he would rather play in Charlotte. 
What kind of thanks is that?
I would have to say that the only
winners this year resulting from the free 
agency would have to be the players, the 
coach, and the fans of Seattle, Washing
ton. They played the market for role 
players, point producers, three-point spe
cialists, defensive stars, all to liken them 
to the depth of the North Carolina 
Tarheels. Coach George Karl, brought 
out of the depths of coaching despair, 
was given another chance by Seattle 
Managements K.C. Jones, the ex-coach 
of the Championship Boston Celtics 
(small world, aint it?). Seattle manage
ment then proceeded to pick out starters 
from teams around the league, not su
perstars; just stars. Included were 
Kendall Gill (from Charlotte), SasH'* 
Perkins (from L.A. Lakers), Eddie 
Johnson (from Phoenix), Ricky Pierce 
(from Milwaukee), and Detlef Schrempf 
(from Indiana), along with native Supersonics Gary Payton and Shawn 
Kemp, form a strong team that should 
be feared. I believe Kemp is the most 
exciting player in pro basketball, since 
Michael Jordan traded his Bulls jersey 
for a Birmingham Barons outfield glove. 
What I want to know is why there was 
never any Shawn versus Michael hype?
Regardless, my picks for the NBA fi
nals, straight from the home office in 
post-Carnival depressed Carnegie 
Mellon, are the Seattle Supersonics get
ting the best of the Atlanta Hawks in six 
games.

Chase for Lord Stanley 
begins for Eastern teams
The Puck Stops Here
By Allan Bourdius
The regular season is over; 
by the time you read this, the 
Srst games of the NHLs sec
ond season will be in the books. 
The Eastern Conference began 
play last night. The West tour
nament opens this evening.
The battle for the final play
off spot came down to the next 
to the last game of the season. 
The New York Islanders 2-0 
win over the Tampa Bay Light
ning locked up a playoff berth 
over the Florida Panthers be
fore the two teams head-toheadmeeting on Thursday. The 
Panthers won the meaningless 
season finale, 4-1.
Two of the Western Confer
ence matchups have changed 
since last week, so heres an 
updated outlook. Once again, 
the teams seed is in parenthe
ses and the team with home-ice 
advantage is listed first.
Calgary Flames (2) vs. 
Vancouver Canucks (7).This 
matchup could be a close one,
except that Calgary is in the 
midst of a hot streak and 
Vancouver finished the season 
in a big slump that cost them a 
better playoff seed. It will be a 
contest of Calgarys experience 
versus Vancouvers promising 
youth. Experience will prob
ably win out. Vancouver goalie 
Kirk McLean is just 15-17 over 
his career in the playoffs. 
Calgarys Mike Vernon has 40 
post-season wins andhell prob
ably have 44 by the time this 
one is in the books. Prediction: 
Calgary in S.
Toronto Maple Leafs (3) 
vs. Chicago Blackhawks (6). 
This is a battle of one-dimensiona! offensive teams. The 
Hawks rely on their Jeremy 
Roenick-centered offense and 
the Leafs offense revolves 
around DougGibnour. Toronto 
here still lias the edge with 
snipers Dave Andreychuk, 
Milce Gartner, and Wendel 
Clark. However, ifChicago can 
shut them down, Toronto will 
fall with them. Unfortunately, 
if Toronto can contain Roenick 
and Tony Amonte, dont expect 
many Blackhawk goals. This 
will likely come down to a 
goaltender battle between the

Golf team wins two tri-meets in busy week
By CAROLYN SKARADA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
On Wednesday, April 13, the 
Carnegie Mellon golf team tri
umphed over competitors Wash
ington & Jefferson University and 
Bethany College. The game was 
held at the Tartans home course, 
Longue Vue Country Club, lo
cated in Verona. The finishing 
score for Carnegie Mellon was a 
total of 419, followed by Wash
ington and Jefferson with 452 
and Bethany with 520.
Highlights for individual golf
ers include Carnegie Mellon se
nior Ryan Elliott and junior Ed 
Lee finishing with top honors. 
They tied for first with 79 apiece.
The Case Western Reserve 
University Invitational in Cleve

Vol Vumeu8 y ,um8lIsl 2l33g8 y Mn Uvms3 Mrrt11 :
Eastern teams open playoffs with big dreams
E6fw15T KesU ACFB k
Hawks Ed Belfour and the Maple 
Leafs Felix Potvin. Their season 
stats are close, but Belfour will 
give Chicago the edge. Predic
tion: Chicago in 7.
Now, as promised, heres a look 
at each of the first round Eastern 
Conference pairings.
New York Rangers (1) vs. 
New York Islanders (8). This 
should be the most exciting first 
round matchup to watch. The ri
valry between the two New York 
teams is as bitter as it can be. The 
Rangers are looking for revenge 
against the Isles. The Long Is
land team won the seasoi} series 
this year, 2-1-2. History is per! haps on the Islanders side. 
Theyre 20-15 vs. the Blueshirts 
in the Playoffs. Its guaranteeed 
i to be a physical series. Look for 
lots of trips to the penalty box. 
The other thing that the Rangers 
have to contend with is The 
Curse. The Rangers havent won 
the Stanley Cup since 1940. The 
I team is loaded with new stars 
(Adam Graves, Mike Richter, 
Brian Leetch, Sergei Zubov) and 
old ones (Mark Messier, Kevin 
 Lowe, Esa Tikkanen, Glenn 
i Anderson). Their mix of talent 
and experience is perhaps un
equaled. If the Rangers have an 
internal weakness, its the fact 
that players dont warm to coach 
Mike Keenan. This is supposedly 
their year, but it wont happen, 
my friends. The Islanders are a 
playoff team. Steve Thomas and 
Ray Ferraro should come up big. 
If center Pierre Turgeon stays 
healthy, the Islanders offense is 
quite potent. Behind the bench, 
A1 Arbour can lift the Islanders 
collection of youngsters and un
derachievers to play above their 
ability. He won four straight 
Stanley Cups as the Islanders 
coach and he knows how to moti
vate. The Rangers collection of 
ex-Chicago Blackhawks andoverthe-hill Edmonton Oilers may 
have seen Stanley Cup glory in 
the past, but what was good yes
terday probably wont cut it to
day. This years regular-season 
champs are heading for yet an
other crash and bum in the play
offs. Keenan and GM Neil Smith 
may be looking for new jobs. Pre
diction: Islanders in 7.
Pittsburgh Penguins (2) vs. 
Washington Capitals (7). The 
Caps won the season series this 
year with the Pens, 2-11, but 
their franchise record in the play
offs vs. Pittsburgh stands at just 
4-8. Caps center Mike Ridley 
was lethal against the Penguins 
this year. He scored two goals 
and eight assists in the four games 
for 10 points. The acquisiton of 
Joe Juneau at the trading dead
line gives the Penguins something 
else to worry about. Center/left 
wing Dimitri Khristich had an 
injury-marred off-year, but if he 
picks up the pace in the playoffs, 
watch out. Pittsburgh right wing 
Doug Brown is a perennial play
off star. His two-way play on both 
the penalty kill and at even 
strength makes him a true un
sung hero. Ron Francis is the 
Pens man on the draw and can 
fill about two-thirds of Mario 
Lemieuxs shoes if Lemieux is 
out of the lineup. Pittsburghs 
chances depend entirely on keep
ing both Lemieux and Rick 
Tocchet in the lineup. Both have 
been sidelined repeatedly with 
back problems. Quite obviously,
the Penguins are a much better 
team with Lemieux in the lineup. 
Washingtons tight checking style 
under coach Jim Schoenfeld could 
frustrate Lemieux very quickly. 
His temper has been really short 
as of late, and he cant help his 
team from the penalty box. Espe
cially in this series, the Pens need 
Tocchets gritty play. If hes out, 
more weight will fall on Tomas
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
Sahdstroms shoulders. Predic
tion: If Lemieux misses only one 
game or less, Pittsburgh in 7. 
Otherwise, Washington in 6.
New Jersey Devils (3) vs. 
Buffalo Sabres (6). The only 
way to put it is that the Devils 
had a franchise season. They set 
team records for fewest goals 
against, wins, points, and goal 
differential. They have the sec
ond-best rated defense at 2.62 
goals allowed per game, the sec
ond-best rated offense at 3.64 
goals per game, and finished the 
season with the second best record 
at 47-25-12 for 106 points. New 
Jersey also led the league in goal 
differential, finishing at plus-86. 
The Devils strength is in bal
ance. Coach Jacques Lemaire 
uses his entire bench throughout 
the course of the game and the 
results are impressive. Forwards 
Stephane Richer, J ohn MacLean, 
Bill Guerin, Valeri Zelepukin, 
Tom Chorske, and Corey Millen 
all had exceptional seasons. The 
defense is perhaps the best 
blueline corps in the league, with 
Scott Stevens, Scott Niedermayer, and Ken Daneyko in its 
ranks. Both of the teams goalies, 
Martin Brodeur and Chris 
Terreri, are solid. Buffalo was 
the other goal-stingy team this 
season, allowing two fewer goals 
than New Jersey to finish with a 
team 2.60 goals against average. 
Buffalo relies heavily on 
Alexander Mogilny, Dale 
Hawerchuk, and Yuri Khmylev 
for their offense, but Khmylev is 
lost for the season. Center Pat 
LaFontaine could return late in 
the series, but rookie Derek 
Plante will have to contribute 
more. Buffalos Dominik Hasek 
is the leagues top goaltender by 
the numbers, but is erratic in 
playoff games. Most importantly, 
however, the Devils beat the Sa
bres in three of their four games 
this season and outscored them
177. Break out the brooms. Pre
diction: New Jersey in 4.
Boston Bruins (4) vs. 
Montreal Canadiens (5). De

Matches will begin on Saturday, April
dont often like to play the first J 
round of the playoffs with the ; 
advantage on somebody elses ice ;
 especially if its Boston. The-; 
tight ice surface in Boston Garj 
den should make this series a \ 
real physical one. With Cam ' 
Neely lost to the Bruins with yet j 
another knee injury, they have to \ 
rely almosttotally on Adam Oates ; 
for offensive pressure. The BruJ 
ins will have to concentrate on | 
defense from the moment the J 
puck is dropped. The tradingJ 
deadline acquisition of A1 Iafrate ; 
will take some of the pressure off ; 
of Ray Bourque and benefit the i 
Bruins. The Canadiens have a j 
good shot at making it back to the ! 
Cup finals, even with their low j 
starting seed. Montreals core of  
Kirk Muller, Vincent Dam; 
phousse, and Brian Bellows all ] 
started the season slow but picked \ 
up their game as time went on, J 
peaking just in time for the play) 
offs. However, the key player for 1 
the Canadiens wont be one of i 
those top stars; itll be defenseman ! 
Lyle Odelein. Odeleins stats this j 
season were something of a dis* 
appointment, but he needs to pickJ 
up his play even more than hffl^ 
already has. Hes tough, physi-j2 
cal, and talented with his stickSj 
Montreal easily has an advan-^ 
tage in goal. Patrick Roy is the** 
quintessential playoff netminder^ 
with two Stanley Cups and tw<$ 
Conn Smythe Trophies (most;' 
valuable player in the playoffs) ter  
his credit. Bostons Jon Casey i$f 
solid, but very streaky. Predict* 
tion: Montreal in 6.
Allan Bourdius is a fifth-year^ 
senior majoring in applied his

In a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.

Buggy design exhibition held
By MATT ADLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Sweepstakes rules mandate that ev
ery buggy involved in the races must be 
on public display during the Design Com
petition. From 9 am until 3:30 pm on the 
Thursday of Carnival, buggies of every 
class and species are open to public 
viewing in the main gym. All construc
tion on steering, brakes, chassis, etc, 
must be completed by the start of the 
Design Competition; what people see, 
(though the buggies are usually sealed 
as tightly as duct tape and fasteners will 
allow) is what they should expect to see 
on the starting line Friday morning.
As an essential component of Sweep
stakes, the Design Competition is an 
opportunity for the organizations to have 
their buggies evaluated by an experi
enced panel of judges.
Buggies are judged on the basis of 
concept and functionality as well as de
sign and craftsmanship in the areas of 
body or frame, steering systems, occu
pancy, and safety.
Judges are instructors and professors 
taken from a variety of technical depart
ments.
This year the list included: Larry 
Cartwright from Civil Engineering, Paul 
Fishbeck from SDS, David Lamont from 
GSIA (who drove buggies a long time
ago, when they were larger), Stephen 
Lee from Architecture, Anthony Thomp
son from Materials Science Engineer
ing, and John Wiss from Mechanical 
Engineering.
Organizations take their buggies from 
the display area in the main gym, to a 
side room for the private presentations. 
The presentations are formal and last 
about 15 minutes. Because the buggies 
are scrutinized so intimately by the 
judges, a few organizations hesitate to 
enter the competition. However, most 
organizations do take this opportunity 
to unveil their creations, so that both 
theory and practice can be put to the test 
during Carnival.
Controversy mars women's buggy
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Sports Editor
The 1994 womens buggy com
petition could have been PiKAs 
day. Instead, it became a day 
marred by controversy. While 
sophomore Laura McClure drove 
PiKA A to victory in 2:42.81, it 
was PhiKap A that got all the 
post-race attention.
During the days rolls, PhiKap 
A and Spirit B were involved in a 
collision when PhiKap A took a 
turn, and Spirit B rammed it from 
behind. Spirit B was determined 
by officials to be at fault, and was 
disqualified. However, the dis
pute began when PhiKap A at
tempted to re-roll.
No re-rolls were awarded by
the judges, but communications 
problems and confusion led a 
number of participants to believe 
that re-rolls had been awarded.
Spirit A had taken second place 
in 2:44.76, and PhiKap B had 
finished third in 2:47.46. After 
the previous days heats, PhiKap 
A had been third, one spot ahead 
of PhiKap B, and the buggy was 
considered a contender for the 
championship.
Sweepstakes chair senior 
Demian Johnston explained the 
decision of senior head judge 
Alexis DePlanque and fifth-year 
senior assistant judge Matt Adler.
There were no re-rolls allotted 
due to the condition of the course, 
Johnston said when contacted 
Sunday night. We spent time
considering them, but did not an
nounce any re-roll decisions, con
trary to what a lot of people be
lieved. Because we werent able 
to do any re-rolls, there were no 
decisions announced.
Johnston said efforts to allow 
re-rolls led to the confusion.
I told all the chairmen who 
had filed protests that if they 
asked to re-rolls, and they were 
awarded, they had to be ready to 
roll  I was trying to give the 
impression, and it didnt work, 
that there was no guarantee of 
re-rolls being allotted.
While the judges and Sweep
stakes committee was discussing 
decisions, the weather turned to 
rain, and a number of people in
volved with Sweepstakes, like
flaggers and timers and police 
officers began to leave.
The problem was that once the 
course was opened, it could not be 
closed.
That was a big part of the prob
lem, according to Russell Elkin, a 
brother at Phi Kappa Theta and 
a former buggy chairman.
[Johnston] said they tried to 
announce through WRCT and the 
radio club that there would be re
roll heats, but because of the rain 
that started, people left. 
[Johnston] said they didnt do a 
good job with communication. 
Why they didnt tell people to go 
back, I dont know. He told me 
they just didnt do a good enough 
job, but Ill have to live with that. 
They didnt make the effort, and
they told us they wouldnt try to.
Johnston admitted there were 
communications problems. The 
quick shower we had led [people]; 
to believe that the day was over. 
After the miscommunication, it 
became unfeasible to hold re
rolls.
Even the admission that the 
committee might have been in 
error did little to ease feelings at. 
PhiKap. However, Katherine 
Allen, a pusher for PhiKap A, 
said, We werent given a fair 
chance, and we werent compen
sate us, either. We were a top 
contender, and we didnt get a 
chance.
Sigma Nu A finished fourth 
(2:48.63), and Theta Xi A fin
ished fifth (3:09.97).

respectable time of 2:21.40 be
fore being disqualified for failing 
a brake test.
By the time the last race was 
over, PiKA was celebrating a 
place atop the leaders with a time 
of 2:09.65. Were looking good, 
said hill three pusher Rich 
Newman. It could be better. We 
could improve on at least two of 
the hills.
Second place Beta A team 
pusher Jeff Gregor expressed 
optimism for the big day. Well 
win tomorrow, he said enthusi
astically.
Saturday  Race Day
I was there, bright and early 
Saturday morning on very little 
sleep, and suffering from a lovely 
sunburn. (Fridays solar blast 
caught us all a little off-guard.) 
There was no place to get break
fast, and it was cold. Races were 
delayed almo^E three hours until 
the roads dried.
Heat one featured the muchanticipated Spirit A/ Phi Kap C 
rerun. Spirits 2:14.54 time held, 
allowing them to finish third over
all, while Phi Kap spun out. SAE 
As rerun time of 2:30.37 gave 
them a ninth place result.
Both crowds and anticipation 
grew by the time PiKAs women 
clinched a win, and it was time 
for the grueling ordeal that is 
Mens Buggy to begin in earnest.
DTD As colorful Darkstar ben
efited from beinglaunchedby the 
strong arms of hill one pusher 
Ken Lambert, a member of the 
Ultimate frisbee team, but their 
time of 2:20.65 wasnt good 
enough to lift them above eighth 
place. Sigma Nus A team placed
mere shadow of its former self, 
finally succumbed to the ominous 
clouds which rolled in over Flag
staff Hill.
Heat four pitted SD C A against 
Beta A. Hill one pushers Jeff 
Gregor [Beta] and Joed Haddad 
[SDC] flexed their muscles and 
snorted in preparation for the 
race in the chilly air. The air 
itself seemed to flex and snort 
with them, as it began to whip 
around the pit in mini twisters 
that spiraled leaves onto the 
lanes. Their finish times closed 
in on Phi Kaps lead. Beta A 
nipped the line at 2:15.38, but 
was disqualified when hill five 
pusher Jarrod Siket crossed the 
line with only one hand on the 
pushbar. SDC A and Sigma Nu 
enjoyed a joint fourth place fin
ish, with times of 2:17.29 each.
It was all down the last heat. 
Would Compubookie be on target 
this year? Could the boys from 
PiKA beat Phi Kaps impressive 
time? Would the growling wind 
affect the race? Would the spec
tators please step back on the 
curb? No way. Everyone was anx
iously awaiting the culmination 
of two days of blood (skinned hill 
one pusher knees), sweat (drivers 
brows), and tears (mine; the sun
burn and lack of sleep took its 
toll, rendering me virtually inco
herent by this point).
PiKA Wins!
The countdown and crack of 
the starters pistol and they were 
off, Tim Smith pushing for PiKA 
A, Phil White for Sigma Nu B. 
The first dime-sized drops began 
to fall from the sky. All ears were 
keenly tuned to WRCTs commenuepaFB ICarg sKK CS SIB .sSSsU sK IpOO SIeBBVAOC,Br RRSI 3pSI C SpUB sK NYNRVMN
moving it snapped off.
The 12th and final heat, how
ever, proved to be the most con
troversial. Just as Spirit Ateams 
ShakaZulu came out of the chute, 
a man stepped onto the course, 
causing it to crash into the bales. 
The team was relieved when a 
Saturday morning rerun was an
nounced. We felt it was deserved, 
once Sweepstakes reviewed the 
tapes, said team member Tom 
Felmley. You could see he was 
blatantly out there  so she 
[driver Cheri Lin] swerved and 
spun out.
The PiKA / Spirit rivalry came 
into play, with PiKA members 
complaining of biased judging. 
Its consistent. Its been happen
ing year after year, said team 
Chair Andy Bordick. [But] its 
too bad that they didnt finish 
with time, allowed push team 
co-captain Ben Bell.
Spirit had good reason to be 
worried about placing for the fi
nal race. Its C team posted a 
 >
fourth with a time of 2:14.59.
Phi Kap B team took a gamble 
in heat two, electing not to start 
in order to concentrate on repairs 
needed on veteran buggy 
Schadenfreude, which suffered 
damage in the womens race. Pika 
C finished in seventh place with 
a time of 2:20.42.
Gamble
Heat three saw Phi Kaps 
gamble pay off as they moved 
into first place with a seemingly 
insurmountable lead time of 
2:13.44. The team and their sup
porters went wild, taking photos 
of themselves beside the leader 
board and praying for the rain, 
which was becoming increasingly 
imminent, to hold off.
Phi Kaps triumph eclipsed 
Beta Bs eighth place showing of 
2:20.94.
You could taste the tension in 
the air. After struggling to stay 
out all morning, the sun, but a
tary as the crowd surged for best 
position around the finish line. 
All eyes darted from the hill to 
catch a glimpse of the buggies to 
the clock mounted on the back of 
a van. Throats were raw with 
deafening vocal encouragement 
coming from all sides. It was in
tense. PiKA As Mad Dog crossed 
the line at 2:09.17 in a blur, fol
lowed by hill five pusher Jeff 
Polega.
Ecstatic PiKA rushed back 
down Tech Street to the pit and 
their U-Haulin order to celebrate, 
as the heavens opened in a furi
ous display of what appears to be 
traditional Carnival wrath.
How does it feel to win Sweep
stakes? Spectacular! gushed 
pusher Rich Newman. Sweep
stakes 94 was over. Although 
totally exhausted, I must truly 
say I was sorry to see it come to an 
end.
By MICKIKOCHANSKYJ
Senior Staffwriter
With a dramatic win for the 
pumped up mens team, the PiKA 
A team, pushing Mad Dog, 
clinched not only the best course 
time in years, but a clean sweep 
of Sweepstakes 94. Tension and
about Buggy Friday morning at 
seven could have fit on the back 
of an ant. I had to get educated, 
and fast.
Walking among the teams, clip
board in hand, watching the offi
cials fire guns into the sky and 
hopping out of the way of frantic 
teams preparing to launch their
crossed the finish line riding the 
truck. Frida/s preliminary races 
were dominated by a number of 
accidents and mishaps. The last 
three heats proved to be the down
fall of several teams, starting in 
the 10th with both Pioneers A 
and Spirit B teams spinning out. 
We had a mechanical problem
excitement built until the last 
heat of the day, when Phi Kap A 
was knocked from the lead by 
PiKA A in their brand new A 
team buggy, Mad Dog, with a 
time of 2:09:17.
In a day dominated by the 
changeable weather,... wait. This 
is a normal, straightforward 
buggy article. In a semester domi
nated by changeable staff writ
ers, it became necessary that I 
cover this hallowed event. Be
cause I am regularly a lowly col
umnist, this prospect filled me 
with fear. I was going to have to 
use actual facts! Actual quotes by 
living people! I was going to have 
to get up at the crack of dawn! 
But, like the dedicated staff mem
ber I am, I met the challenge.
Friday  Preliminaries
Do I sound excited? You bet. If 
you cant appreciate my exces
sive use of hyperbole, then I can 
only presume you werent at 
Buggy. I have to admit, I never 
paid it any attention before. I was 
a Buggy virgin. I think I scared a 
few people in the U-Haul pit by 
approaching them with the most 
innocuous of questions. My stan
dard line was, Hey (insert fra
ternity name here) guy  like, 
whos driving your buggy? Natu
rally, I didnt get far. What I knew
vehicles, I began to get a feel for 
what it was all about. Fevered 
competition, impassioned cama
raderie, the hopes and dreams of 
an entire year expressed in the 
concentration lining the brows of 
the nervous pushers.
As the sun (which was to prove 
alarmingly strong) rose, and 
heats progressed through the 
morning, I learned about the 
other aspect of Buggy  the side

Sororities, indpendants pack midway
By JENNIFER BARKIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Wednesday night and Thursday 
afternoon were hectic for the 
booth organizations as they 
worked towards a finished prod
uct for Spring Carnival 1994. The 
organizations had to have their 
booths completed between 4 and 
4:30 pm on Thursday, in the half 
hour that they describe as crunch 
time. Booths were considered in 
three separate categories for com
petition: sororities, fraternities, 
and independents.
Sororities
Delta Gammas Lauren Leader 
said their booth, The Great Bar
rier Reef, was built with an ut
most environmental concern, as
the sisters reused wood from 
Greek Sing. Sangita Jinwala 
commented Booth is about get
ting together and having fun. Its 
really refreshing after the stress 
of Greek Sing.
Paula Dube, talking about 
Kappa Kappa Gammas Hersheys Kiss, said, We will be 
giving out real hugs and kisses 
outside the booth. The sisters 
also found out during their booth 
building that Scotch tape is not 
structural.
Kappa Alpha Thetas booth 
chair, Marisa Timperman, talked 
about their Japanese Garden of 
Tranquility. She said, We de
cided to put on a two layer roof 
this Carnival. Its definitely been 
the most challenging structur
ally.
Delta Delta Deltas booth chair,
Lisa D Andrea, said while paint
ing Lego Land, Its coming down 
to the wire. Im pretty excited 
about everything thats on Mid
way.
Independents
Lambda Sigmas theme for this 
years booth competition was, 
quite simply, Pittsburgh. Scott 
Wilkinson peeked out from the 
black and gold building to tell 
me, Its a lot of work, a lot of fun. 
The Hockey Clubs Blair Echols 
said of Hockey Night in Canada, 
Were glad we can participate 
and also raise money for the 
hockey team. Its nice to be a part 
of everything.
Pioneers were working on Ra
dio City Music Hall. Lisa Drake 
commented on how they came up
with the unique idea. We wanted 
to do something different. We 
wanted to avoid countries because 
theyre common themes. The 
structure was easy and Radio City 
Music Hall is world renowned.
Amy McGovern felt that KGBs 
Russian Space Station, MIR, 
would help bring the organiza
tion back into competition after 
not building a booth for three 
years.
Charles Hun, ASAs president, 
said, Weve worked really hard 
to have a unique design. The 
quality of all the booths on Mid
way seem better this year. Their 
booth theme for Carnival 94 was 
Gateway to Eastern Skies.
Spirits theme of the Carib
bean originated with their de
sire to highlight African Ameri
can Culture. Xavier Cain, the
booth chair, explains, Spirit is 
trying to get back to where they 
were seven years ago. Each year 
we get better. Our Buggy organi
zation is already established, and 
now we are trying to bring Booth 
to the forefront.
David Lionetti, of Fringe, 
speaks of the Amelia Earhart 
booth. We have a very uncon
ventional theme this year. Its 
been fun making it work. Our 
booth chair has done a lot. I told 
Lionetti how impressive and im
posing their booth looked, with 
its sizable plane suspended abov( 
the scene.
SDCs theme this year, Citiej 
Around the World, was coming 
along just fine, according to Scott 
Curtin, during crunch time. He 
told me that SDC had a lot of funi 
building this year.
Society of the Prowss Hot Spots 
Around the World was the most 
creative and elaborate project 
theyve ever done, says Chan 
Shin.

Phi Kappa Thetas Norway 
was one of the most original and 
beautiful booths on Midway. Its 
colorful exterior weathered the 
storm well; its interior boasted 
ornate carvings, pews, electric 
candles, an iron chandelier, and 
a pleasant woodsy smell. I espe
cially appreciated the individual 
wooden shingles on the roof.
Delta Upsilons DUrassic 
Park booth was closed due to 
storm damage on Saturday, but 
that didnt detract from its strik
ing exterior appearance. A toothy, 
open-jawed T-Rex greeted visi
tors at the entrance of this molded 
structure; rocks and Jurassicvegetation rounded out the picture.
Kappa Delta Rhos colorful 
Forbidden City was full of Asian 
motifs. Chinese lanterns, exotic 
designs, and golden columns 
made the interior an elegant, 
simple room.
Sigma Tau Gammas Rural 
America got my vote as the most 
cacophonic booth; its schoolhouse 
bell, audible even in Morewood, 
rang at all hours of the day. Out
side, the white-painted structure 
was landscaped nicely with 
shrubs, a real brick path, and 
goklenlamps; inside, the A-frame 
roof and real schoolhouse para
phernalia lent an air of reality to 
the theme.
Theta Xis Puerto Rico tiki 
hut, with its sandy tropical beach 
theme, may not have gone well 
with the weekends storms, but 
the free Puerto Rico brochures 
and the funky music emanating 
from the hut more than compen
sated for the weather.
Alpha Epsilon Pis Alcatraz 
booth wasnt pretty on the out
side  but then again, neither 
was the original jail. Inside, real
istic prison bars and a couple of 
actual inmates completed the 
picture. A screaming siren atop 
the booth added to the prison 
atmosphere and annoyed sensitive-eared Camival-goers in the 
immediate vicinity.
Sigma Nus The Seven Seas 
won no points for originality; its 
unadorned boxlike structure 
made me wonder if the designers 
took the word booth a bit too 
literally. Still, Zoos game won 
the popularity contest with the 
kiddies  its booth was the only 
one with a line of kiddies queued 
up waiting to play.
Delta Tau Deltas Atlantis 
booth managed to convey an in
credible sense of space in its two 
stories. The molded, ivy-draped 
structure boasted an interior with 
a fountain and an exterior with 
plaster statues.
Sigma Alpha Epsilons 
Gilligans Island featured a pier, 
a beach, and a hut. My favorite 
part, however, was the bicycle 
that powered everything from the 
washing machine to the radio on 
the campy 60s sitcom.
Pi Lambda Phis Olde West 
seemed like a good booth idea in 
general. The tall oil rig, trading 
post, and oil drums lent authen
ticity to the western structure. 
The only thing I cant understand 
is why the PiLams decided to 
incorporate the Old English 
Olde into their otherwise good 
old American theme.
Beta Theta Pis Parthenon-like 
booth didnt hold up under the 
storm; there wasnt much left of 
it by Saturday, when I looked in.
Pi Kappa Alphas Paris booth 
The Eiffel Towerwas done 
on painted cardboard and had a 
few panels missing after the 
storm. The flashing light did lend 
a somewhat authentic Parisian 
air to an otherwise thrown-together looking structure.
Kappa Sigmas Beer Wurld 
was gone on Saturday  just... 
gone.
Luckily, some of us paid hom
age to this worthy theme, in our 
own special way, throughout Car
nival.
Its almost enough to bring tears 
to my eyes.

Carnival patrons shook-up by midway rides
By ERIC ALZMAN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
If you walked out to the Carnival Mid
way this past weekend, the place seemed 
full. Quite an impressive feat, consider
ing there were only five rides (six if you 
count the bumper cars). So, with the 
throbbing still in my head and the nau
sea fresh in my stomach, I sit down to 
tell you what I thought of all the rides.
The Gravitron
A common aspect of most amusement 
. parks, this ride lived up to its expected 
standards. On a scale of one to 10, the 
ride scored eights in both the head pain 
and nausea categories.
The flashing lights, loud music, and 
obnoxious attendant helped ensure a 
strong queasy feeling. Just as the walls 
begin to stop spinning, the attendant 
surprises the riders by telling them that 
if they scream, theyll get to go again. Oh 
baby, the fun never stops.
 - With a surprisingly lengthy twirling 
session, the Gravitron guarantees that
its patrons will not be back too soon.
The Sizzler
Consisting of two-person carts sliding 
back and forth in apparent collision, 
this ride provides non-height-frighten
ing, high speed, breezy fun ... for the 
person on the left. For the person on the 
right, the entire ride is one long ques
tion: Umph, uh, could you move over, 
umph? The speed, which wasnt all that 
impressive, and the angle of the Sizzler 
constantly throw one person into the 
other. The ride also falls short on length. 
When it began to slow down, I was sure 
that it would then repeat itself back
wards because it couldnt possibly be 
over yet. However, the attendant came 
to open the safety bar. If I hadnt gotten 
on for free, I probably would have asked 
for my money back.
Paratrooper
Those umbrella type chairs that went 
up and around in a circle were the Para
trooper. Soaring above the garage made
the height of the ride seem impressive. 
While the speed was a little under par, 
the downward swoop accompanied by 
the chairs twisting made the ride a good 
time. Thankfully, the Paratrooper had 
nothing to add to the throbbing already 
established in my head from the 
Gravitron and reinforced by the Sizzler. 
Even the nausea rated low with a score 
of four. This number results solely from 
the big swoop. The majority of the ride is 
just a speedy, fun time. Length, once 
again, rears its ugly little head as the 
main problem. The rating is a six, but 
still, I wasnt quite ready to get off (the 
ride).
Sky diver
Far and away, this is the best ride on 
the lot. Also with a six in the length 
category, the high scores in just about 
everything else more than make up for 
this rides fleetiveness. Nausea 10! 
The spinning, twirling, and jolting got 
me thinking about what I had for din
ner. (Yes, I went on the rides just 20 
minutes after eating in a challenge to
vomitation.) In case you dont know, this 
was the ride that looked like a ferris 
wheel but faster. Plus, inside the carts 
was a steering wheel so you could make 
your individual cart spin upside down or 
sideways as often as you wished. The 
height of the Skydiver blew the Para
trooper away. Of course, after a while it 
didnt matter because you couldnt tell 
where you were anyway. Speed earns a 
seven which does not really do the ride 
justice. Overall, it may not have been too 
fast, but the steering wheel added enough 
spinning to make the ride seem incred
ibly fast.
Thanks to the spinning, there is also a 
fine assortment of bumping around and 
friend smushing. Basically, whoever of 
the two in the cart is the stronger, can 
turn the wheel in the direction that 
makes the other one get smushed. At 
this point I got my revenge for the Siz
zler. The Skydiver also looks really cool, 
especially at night.
Pirate Ship
Finally, the Pirate Ship, an obvious
10-point nausea ride. While smaller than 
other pirate ship rides that I have been 
on, this one did its job of making yoij 
think your stomach got caught on some 
thing 30 feet high when you were a foot 
away from the ground. This is the only 
other ride that can match the Gravitrons 
length. I was pleasantly surprised to 
find myself with enough time to pretend 
to throw up on the person next to me 
about five or six times. Bumping around 
was minimal, but speed, scoring a nine,; 
did not disappoint.
Bumper Cars
I got tickets for free. However, even 
free tickets werent worth spending on 
those pathetic bumper cars. The floor 
looked like the size of a Donner dorm 
room and the speed of the cars appeared 
to be negative.
Thanks to a really active student body 
(sarcasm) no one had to worry about 
long lines. The rides, while pricy, were 
accessible. Still, I have yet to have my 
record of never puking on a ride broken.

Whiskey TANGO
Whiskey TANGO, who appeared on 
the Corner Stage on Friday, played an 
eclectic mix of ethnic acoustic styles. 
The two-man sound machine, Robert 
Spate on violin and Pete Fields on folk 
guitar, ran through a repertoire of tan
gos, Celtic songs, and songs ranging 
from the Charlie Brown theme to a few 
Doors songs. Unfortunately, they 
wouldnt play Freebird.
The duos relaxing fare was an inter
esting and cultural way of starting out a 
three-night binge of hedonism and Car
nival games. The guitar was clean and 
bright, and Fields finger-picking was 
exquisite. The violin wailed and 
squeaked melodiously over the guitars 
heavy bass and tenor lines; the two in
struments melded beautifully.
Frank Sinatra and Joe Williams. Most 
standards are about [love], said 
Cosentino of the groups style. I found 
this true, yet the group, with or without 
vocals, maintained a smooth, steady pace 
throughout all of their songsgreat for 
toe-tapping.
The Bloomfield 5 used to play regu
larly at Scotland Yard, but now they can 
be found in clubs across Pittsburgh.
 Kathline Wright
The Broken
The Broken (formerly All Fall Down 
and even more formerly the Painted 
Mice) performed Thursday evening in 
the GSO Coffeehouse as a part of Spring 
Carnivals opening night. They per
formed their multi-faceted tunes to a 
rather sparse, laid-back crowd. The BroPCadC hsaBOOdT OBCr gpaFBe sK !BOOdT SIes3g pa gsUB p,B/,sOr IsS Op,ngV
Fields, a Polygram recording artist, 
was the quiet one of the two. Spates, a 
world-reknowned violinist, played the 
folky tunes with great energy and waxed 
jovial with the captivated audience. 
Whiskey TANGO was a wonderful way 
to spend a few minutes away from the 
hustle and bustle of crazy old Carnival 
 John Biggs
The Bloomfield 5
On Thursday afternoon The Bloomfield 
5, a jazz band that originated at CMU, 
was the second band to grace the comer 
stage at Carnival. Their sound, a mix
ture of saxophone, bass, drums, key
board, and vocals, was traditional and 
reminiscent of jazz music of days gone
by.
I was most impressed by the group 
sans vocals because a delicacy came from 
the instruments not apparent during 
the songs with words. The instrumentals, 
though not exactly daring, had an ele
ment of experimentation because of the 
surprise addition of the steely, surreal 
keyboard. The sound was a bit controlled 
but appropriate to the traditional sound.
The Bloomfield 5 did not push any
thing to extremes, which made the mu
sic generally likeable, but I missed the 
experimental flavor that can make jazz 
distinguishable. There were no solos 
highlighting the powerful sounds and 
energy that these instruments hold, al
though the cymbals stood out occasion
ally as the drummer used them subtly 
and delicately.
Andrew Cosentino (93) on vocals joined
ken has such a wide range of influences 
that its hard to define their sound.
The members of this six piece alterna
tive band are all Carnegie Mellon stu
dents. They performed 
songs that convey a 
wide range of emotions 
from happy, light love 
tunes to a dark, moody 
song about suicide. The 
Brokens main 
strengths were the 
pounding beats of 
drummer Roger Hsiao 
that could be heard on 
the Cut and vocalist 
Sandy 0 Tooles magi
cal voice.
Although the crowd 
was certainly not one 
that filled room capac
ity, The Broken still 
played a invigorating 
set. Perhaps now The 
Broken will stick to this 
name even though their 
music doesnt need to be fixed.
 Jason Andracki
Belly
It was not a day I might have expected. 
On Friday, I was waiting for anyone or 
anything to carry me away and assure 
me that my life would not constantly be 
like this. Thats what Carnival is all 
about, right? Well, my hopes were an
swered soon thereafter.
Out on the stage came a lady throwing 
small handfuls of something to the audito listen to. Her voice 
carries much more 
than just the lyrics 
she sings. It is filled 
with emotion and a 
sort of soft but 
sturdy punch that, 
would affect you 
even if you had no 
idea what was be
ing said. Whatever 
she utters into the 
microphone takes 
on a whole new sur
real form in the 
listeners ears.
More notable than 
her voice is her en
tire stage presence 
which works well 
with the rest of the 
band. They all car
ried themselves off 
very confidently and 
seemed to love play
ing for CMU, espe
cially the bassist, 
whose energy is 
comparable to that 
displayed in a 
Pantera video.
It was definitely a shame that they 
had to cancel a large portion of the con
cert due to the oncoming lightning. Belly 
was great about it, however, saying how 
they loved us but just could not die for 
us.
Despite such unforseeable circum
stances, it is great to see a band have 
such a sense of humor  and hey, I got 
my escape and still got to listen to them 
play Dusted before they left.

the musicians for a few songs. Images of ence; Im still not sure what those things
Frank Sinatra flashed before my eyes as 
he sang songs of love in a controlled, toetapping manner. Cosentino actually has 
a great voice, perfect for a lounge singer; 
I think he is trapped in this role because 
he only does cover songs from tradi
tional singers.
[The musicians] play more progres
sive, be-bop stuff; I sing standards, like
were. For some of the audience it may 
have just been the start of a show, but for 
me, and I am sure for many others, too, 
it was a chance to escape from reality 
and I was ready. The woman on stage 
was Tanya Donelly, and her alternative 
rock group, Belly, was just about to start 
their performance.
Donelly, the lead singer, is incredible
perform on the Comer Stage, but on 
Friday afternoon the weather changed 
those plans, and he moved inside to play 
in Scotland Yard before a disappointing 
small audience.
Gillen writes all of his own music, 
which makes it deeply personal. His 
lyrics are new, fresh, and thought-pro
voking, as he sings about love, memo
ries, and freedom. He has a storytelling 
style, weaving a web of meaningful words 
and drawing you in with a voice so ten
der and sincere 
that its hard to let
go-He had a great 
variety of sound, 
from powerful, 
deep, throaty vo
cals asking How 
far? How long?
How much? How 
strong? in his song S 6Zi-Hair

gentle whispers about memories of home 
in the song Hazelwood. The guitar 
always complemented his voice, never 
overpowered it, even during quick, strong 
moments as in the song Shes Always 
Been a Sweet Little Girl.
Many songs focused on love. His lyrics 
and sound took a new, sentimental look 
at this powerful emotion in such songs 
as Footsteps and This Kind of Love. 
Unfortunately, Gillens moving perfor
mance did not reach many people be
cause of all of the relocation commotion. 
For those who missed him, Roger Gillen 
is a must-hear. Look for his album, which 
should be released soon in music stores.

The House Jacks
Acapellainyourface! 
That is The House Jacks 
motto  appropriately 
so. This diverse group of 
six gorgeous East coast 
gentlemen, from a Jason 
Priestley wanna-be to a 
dreadlocked bohemian, 
shouted, sang, jumped, 
and filled the audience 
with energy.
The House Jacks have 
been together for three 
years and they are al
ready sweeping college 
campuses across the na
tion, creating a flurry of 
excitement in their path. 
Their sound is new, espe
cially on their covers, in

choreography, energy and personal con
tact with audience members kept every
one in an awestruck state.
They have recently released an album 
of original songs, Naked Noise. They 
performed several songs from this al
bum, which, incredible as they were, 
were unfortunately not as impressive as 
the songs they covered. A few of their 
slower songs entered the realm of the 
Boyz II Men sound, but The House Jacks 
had a different look and stronger perfor
mance.
At the moment, Naked Noise is only a 
mail order album, but it will be a must 
buy as soon as it enters stores. Most of 
all, The House Jacks are a crowd pleaser, 
so if you missed their performance Fri
day night, try to catch them as they 
continue touring the country.

Strykers Posse
The Baltimore roots-rock-reggae band 
Strykers Posse urged the audience to 
feel da vibrations on Saturday as they 
jammed in the Tent. The three-woman, 
four-man bands original-style reggae 
featured sweet, lilting harmonies, a 
strong rhythm section, and original songs

Comedians liven stage with hilarious acts
By JENNIFER TURNER
Tartan Staffwriter
fThis years Spring Carnival en
tertainment hit the ground run
ning on Thursday with David 
Kinne, gained momentum on Fri
day with Carlos Alazraqui, and 
didnt stop until Saturday night 
when Drew Carey told the last 
jofce. When it came to the comedy 
line-up, the Spring Carnival En
tertainment Committee lived up 
to its name.
ftock n Roll comedian Kinne 
started it off hilariously on Thurs
day night with a tale of his trav
els; through comedy clubs across 
the country.
ije touched on a variety of sub
jects ranging from the politically 
coirect term for ugly (aestheti
cally challenged) to the way so
briety tests should be conducted 
(an ugly woman/man should be 
stashed in the back of a police 
cruiser).
The driving theme continued 
as he talked about the inanity of 
some signs (Ice May Form In 
Winter), and proposed variations 
on them (Leaves May Fall In 
Autumn).
Then he described ways he cus
tomized his car to break the mo
notony of driving (he replaced his 
headlights with black lights, and 
his windshield Vith magnifying
He explained southern mea
surements to the audience (from 
a couple to a whole bunch to a 
shitload) and common southern 
phrases (such as thats moren I 
can shake a stick at).
He commented on subjects 
ranging from what constitutes a 
good mall (any with a Victorias 
Secret in it) to the worst televi
sion commercials (Lome Green 
for dog food).
He concluded his act with sev
eral blues versions of popular tele
vision theme songs (Gilligans 
Island and Star Trek), imitations 
of popular rock stars (Tom Petty 
and Bruce Springsteen), and then 
launched into a song he wrote 
himself, I Dont Love You Since 
You Ate My Dog.
On Friday night, the comedy 
continued with Alazraqui. He got 
off to a slow start, but by the end 
of the evening he was on a roll.
He started out by explaining 
that his last name was actually 
the bottom line on an eye chart 
(for which he got a few laughs).
Then he went on to tell the audi
ence about his friend, comic Henry 
Cho, a Korean with a Tennessee 
accent. 0
Throughout his act, 
Alazraqui frequently 
harked back to his Cali
fornia roots and at one 
point, explained to the au
dience the difference be
tween California and 
Texas: Texas was named 
by real cowboys, and Cali
fornia was named by a 
Spanish interior designer.
He regaled the audience 
with tales of his seven 
years in college, the witti
cisms of his friends, and 
the tricks used by students 
to stay drunk all the time 
(beer in the humidifier).
He described his job at 
a health club after his col
lege graduation, compar
ing women who worked 
out early in the morning 
to demons, and men to 
Columbo.
He talked about the 
biathlon (must have been 
invented by Swedish youth gangs) 
and told the audience the reason 
why no minorities partipated.
He ended by discussing break
ups and the wrong way to do it 
(lets be friends).
On Saturday night, there was

ABeKseUBr sa SIB flS PIlegrCd CKSBeassaV
standing room only in the tent as 
Camival-goers crowded in for the 
last performance of Carnival.
Carey, star of the NBC series The 
Good Life, did not disappoint his 
audience. He kept them laughing 
from his first joke to his last, and 
for some time after that.
He began by cracking jokes 
about Booth, and went on from 
there. He discussed Earth Day, 
animal rights activists, and their 
crusades for cute animals (dol
phin-safe tuna? what about the 
tuna?), and the movie Free Willy 
(they could keep him in captivity 
long enough to make a movie).
He touched on subjects such as 
Santa Claus and the Easter 
Bunny, asking why Christians 
allow their holy days to be turned 
into cartoons. (You dont see the 
Passover Kangaroo.)
He told us exactly how to have 
the Disneyland experience with
out leaving our own neighbor
hoods, then advised us not to go 
back to our high school reunions 
(especially if its the five-year re
union).
He talked about smoking, criti
cizing health freaks (terming 
them safety Nazis). He told the 
audience that he would never 
make out a living will. What if 
being a vegetable was the best 
thing that ever happened to him?
He expounded on postal work
ers, the homeless, and Sally 
Struthers ads for correspondence 
school. He talked briefly about 
Texas and questioned the ratio
nality of rodeos and drive-in li
quor stores.
He went on to talk about sexual 
harassment and relationships in 
general. He advised everyone to 
be themselves  no matter what 
size that may beas long as they 
covered themselves up. He told 
the audience about the power of 
positive thinking, and gave them 
several examples.
Carey concluded his act by leav
ing the audience with a handful 
of jokes to tell family and friends 
(and anyone else who didnt hap
pen to be there Saturday night).
With hilarious jokes and im
peccable timing, Carey brought 
to a close what Kinne had started 
on Thursday night.
We should all give a hand to the 
Spring Carnival Entertainment 
Committee. They really delivered 
this year with a slate of comics 
who kept us rolling in the aisles, 
and left us wanting more. Now 
lets just hope they can do as well 
next year.

Nemeses creates magical, entertaining fare

saying that when I went to see

on! Regardless, I was certain that 
the audience was now prepared 
for a story a little stretch beyond 
the confines of everyday life.
So how was I to accept this?

theatrical medium and not let me 
know what was coming next? 
Well, the fact is that they had 
every right and I loved the sus
pense that was imposed on me.
Although I could not immedi
ately make sense of what was 
going on, I had an inner recognition.of the powers of good and evil 
and the war that they were wag
ing against each other in the play. 
It was more than each character 
having an assigned code of ethics 
to live by. The roles involved the 
purging of inner demons and com
ing to terms with the 
dark forces within 
ones self.
This theme was re
flected in both the 
constant cuts from 
scenes of the modern 
world that is famil
iar to the audience 
and a deeper, darker 
world that parallels 
it and the extensive 
use of mirrors which 
seemed to show a side 
of the individual that 
one can rarely see on 
ones own.
I should not only 
dwell on the themes 
of the production, be

job of putting 
this musical together  
from the musical score to 
the performances.
The music was really cool.
It was kind of like an ex

ment to Phantom of the Op
era. In addition, I was sit
ting only a couple of feet 
from the conductor, who 
was strangely not even 
close to the ensemble he 
was conducting. It took me 
half of the play just to fig
ure out that he was raising 
his arms to a video camera 
sitting on a tri-pod and not
to the wall he was facing.
I had a lot of fun watching the 
performances, too. Teiivio, (Andy 
Folmer, Senior 
Chemistry), who 
was supposed to 
be evil incarnate, 
was not too far 
off with his abil
ity to brush off 
pleas to be saved 
like most would 
brush off bad 
dandruff. It 
never fails to 
amaze me how 
evil gets por
trayed as suavely 
as it does, while 
its counterpart, 
the kindly old

is under such

Barnan, but the

did a great job being completely 
frustrated with the ensuing 
events while Teiivio got to have

long-labored over Sunday dinner in 
which they were about to partake (one 
which, in the second act, the Priore fam
ily and friends actually do partake). In 
addition to making the audience feel at 
home, this actual cooking of food worked 
well with giving the audience under
standing to the overall importance of 
food and cooking in the Priore home, 
particularly for mama Rosa, and, as we 
find later in the play, quite importantly 
for the driving conflict in the play itself.
With the aid of strong character writ
ing, all the actors played their roles 
quite well. Particularly a crowd pleaser 
was Smeal as the overly melodramatic 
and Pulcinella-obsessed budding actor,
Uncle Raffaele. Another favorite seemed
to be the strong-willed and almost overly 
domineering Aunt Meme, played by 
Emmi Shaw. However, most all of the 
acting was 
excellent,

Leichenko 
as Rosa and

High Voltage
Abby Schiff
I freely admit I know absolutely nothing about alternative music, 
so when I went to see High Voltage play in the tent on Saturday 
afternoon, I really wasnt sure what to expect. Im still not sure 
exactly what I heard, but I can tell you one thing  these guys can 
flat out play.
The four-man group from nearby Heidelberg dropped in on Carni
val and proceeded (with a little help from the wind) to almost blow 
the top off the tent. They covered a number of alternative and rock 
bands, includingStone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam, and played 
three songs off of their upcoming album, Edge of the World.
The covers were all strong, and the original songs, Platform Zero, 
Fishin, and Wait for Something were excellent. Although Josh 
Holmes vocals were sometimes thoroughly indecipherable, I think 
Ill be hearing John Karbos pounding drums well into the 21st 
century.
Holmes is a good singer, capable of doing more than screaming into 
the mic, Karbo was superb, and guitarist Nick Catanese and bassist 
Mike Mizia were both excellent.
The only problems the band ran into were technical problems with 
one microphone and a weak cover of Give It Away, by the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers. Otherwise, though, the band just cranked up the 
volume and jammed, with the crowd applauding loudly after every 
song.
All in all, High Voltage lived up to its name and proved a worthy 
member of the Carnival entertainment bill.

Mystery reigns 
with hypnotist
By JASON ANDRACKI
Tartan Staffwriter
Hypnotist Ramelle MaCoy 
helped open this years Spring 
Carnival in a mesmerizing way 
in the Carnival Tent on Thurs
day night. He performed his 
trade to a packed tent with the 
aid of 10 volunteers, five fe
males and five males. Although 
this group was very dispropor
tionate to the actual CMUpopulation their antics were still 
veiy entertaining;
Prior to actually beginning 
his act, MaCoy provided some 
information about the art of 
hypnotism, ranging from ex
amples about who uses hypno
tism, such as former Steeler 
Terry Bradshaw, to dispelling 
myths about the art. He reas
sured potential volunteers that
he was feeling healthy and even 
if something happened to him 
that they would still wake up 
about 15 minutes later.
Following this, MaCoy began 
steps that he used to relax his 
subjects. Then the real fun be
gan. After waking up his patients 
under a trance, he began playing 
various tricks on the group as a 
whole. For instance, he made 
them watch an X-rated movie 
(which two subjects enjoyed a lot) 
and sing to deaf babies. Next, 
MaCoy used his power on indi
vidual volunteers. When he 
touched his tie, he had them do 
things from sitting on pins and 
needles to jumping up and down 
shouting, Yee-hee look at me!
MaCoy provided an informa
tive performance while his guests 
provided the laughs with their 
hypnotic antics.

Frankenstein
Despite being forced to perform in Grey Matter because the Comer 
Stage blew over, CMUs own Frankenstein put on quite a show on the 
final day of Spring Carnival. Billed as funk, rock groove, they 
packed Grey Matter even tighter than registration day for Orienta
tion, which surprised even the bandmembers themselves.
Even with the cramped area they were given to perform in, this sixpiece (guitar, bass, drums, saxophone, trombone, and vocalist) funk 
machine put on an extremely energetic and crowd pleasing show. All 
the band members performed peerlessly, but guitarist Gabe Kuo and 
vocalist Clarence were outstanding. They seemed to put every ounce 
of energy that they possessed into each tune and enjoy every second 
of it.
Although Frankenstein didnt perform a single bad song, special 
mention has to be made of two songs in particular.
The Frankenstein funk version of Michael Jacksons 
Billie Jean was easily the highlight of the show, 
complete with some of Jacksons dance moves cop
ied by Clarence (thankfully no crotch-grabbing, 
though). Thanks to some interesting lyrics and a 
great Sammy Davis, Jr. impersonation that couldnt 
have been more perfect without a glass eye, Big 
Fish, one of the more mellow tunes, was a close 
second to Billie Jean.
In these days of angst filled music, Frankenstein 
served up a refreshing alternative with their funk.
