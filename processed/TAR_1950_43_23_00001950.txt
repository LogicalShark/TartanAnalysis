The Other Side
The recent disapproval by the Athletic Board 
of the proposed scheduling of the University of 
Nebraska for an opening game next fall has 
left many questions unanswered among both 
students and players. Several of these can be 
brought to light now.
First  of all, the board was fully aware that 
Carnegies Athletic department could have been 
two or three thousand dollars richer had the 
trip materialized. Secondly, they were also welladvised on the fact that the players had voted 
in favor of the game and that, in general, the 
students were also in favor.
Greatly outweighing: these facts, however, were 
the four arguments presented by the board for 
not wanting to schedule the game. The first 
reason has been very prevalent since the news
papers announced the tentative plans for the game. 
Public opinion had very definitely interpreted this 
move as a step toward the big time by Carnegie 
Tech. This is an opinion which the administration 
is desirous of steering clear of, and also one 
which many alumni would not appreciate.
Which brings into focus the second reason 
the dissenting vote of the Steffan Fund committee, 
whose unenviable job it is to comb the alumni 
for contributions with which to award deserving 
athletes financial aid in the form of scholarships. 
The Steffan contributors could rightfully resent 
contributing to the aid of students if they had 
any inkling that these funds were being put to 
use in rebuilding Carnegie Tech into a major 
gridiron power once again. At present, all drives 
for funds are based on the fact that the Steffan 
fund is trying mainly to give some boys an edu
cation.
The final two reasons for giving the red light 
to the Nebraska game revolve around the admin
istrations opinion that Carnegie is not ready 
for class A football yet. If, and when we do get 
sound footing in class B, then it is very possible 
that such a game would be considered, probably 
with a team at home such as Pitt. A game with 
a team of the stature of Nebraska at the outset 
of the 1950 season, could very easily ruin the 
remaining season for the Tartans.
If for no reason than that the Steffan Fund 
would lose valuable support, the judgment and 
decision of the Athletic Board should be accepted 
in good spirit by both students and players. The 
recent success and all future progress of Car
negie Techs football team depends to a great 
extent on the Steffan Fund committee and con
tributing alumni.
Congrats!1 D
The various womens organizations which 
sponsored candidates for Carnival Queen can 
feel justified in having completed a job well 
done in campaigning for their candidate.
The well-organized and spirited campaigning 
which had the campus on end for three days 
last week is a good indication that Carnegie 
sororities are as much a part of campus spirit 
as their Greek brothers.
On the other hand, the men can hang their 
heads in shame for the poor turnout at the ballots. 
With the sensational publicity stunts coming one 
after another during the week, there should have 
been no student left untouched. Yet, only 40% 
of the eligible voting student body cast a vote.

Letter To The Editor
Flags Condition 
At CIT Scored
All Americans should have a great sense of 
respect for the American flag; it is a symbol to 
be deeply revered and admired. I, for one, am 
ashamed of the condition of the flag used on 
the CIT campus. It is dirty, discolored, and tatter
ed to a point where its immediate replacement 
becomes a necessity.
Perhaps this is a minor point for a gripe, 
but it seems to me that some slight, insignificant 
portion of the funds for campus improvement 
could be set aside for the purpose of purchasing 
a new flag. If Carnegie Tech can afford new 
buildings, redecorated offices, and losses on most 
of their school dances, then it seems that a few 
dollars for a new flag is not asking too much. 
I have heard that some campus organizations 
are looking for projects to justify their existence; 
here is certainly an opportunity for somebody.
Another question I would like answered is 
why the flag is flown at half mast on days when, 
as far as I can see, there is no justification for it. 
Half mast is supposed to be reserved for special 
commemorations and memorials.

Lack Of Spirit 
Cramps ROTC
Another school dance falls by the wayside! 
The cancellation of the ROTC dance shows again 
the general lack of campus spirit and support 
toward school dances. It is particularly bad in 
this case, however, since the dance was to be 
held for one of the most closely knit organiza
tions at Carnegiethe ROTC unit.
Perhaps the fact that the dance was a closed 
affair very close to Carnival was the cause for 
its failure, but I hope that the new Student Council 
committee formed to analyze the dance situation 
in general comes up with some ideas and solu
tions in the near future.

Op era Group 
Will Present 
Don Pasquale
Believing that Pittsburgh music 
lovers enjoy operas in the lighter 
vein, as well as those of the more 
tragic nature and endings, the 
Pittsburgh Ofiera Company offers 
as their March attraction the 
comic opera Don Pasquale on 
the evenings of Thursday and Sat
urday, March 30 and April 1, at 
Syria Mosque.
Featured in the title role will 
be the great Metropolitan basso 
Salvatore Baccaloni, who needs no 
introduction to this city. Mr. Bac
caloni first delighted New York 
audiences on Dec. 21, 1940, with 
his inimitable portrayal of Don 
Pasquale at the Metropolitan 
Opera House. Not in memory 
has the company possessed a basso 
buffo of the gift and personality 
of Salvatore Baccaloni, wrote the 
late Oscar Thompson of the New 
York Sun.
The role of Norina in the opera 
will be sung by Pittsburghs own 
Mary Martha Briney; Felix 
Knight, lyric tenor, appears in the 
role of Ernesto, and John Brown
lee as Dr. Malatesta. Mr. Knight 
and Mr. Brownlee both of the 
Metropolitan, will be supported 
by a fine local cast including John 
Thomas in the role of The Notary.

QUEEN CAMPAIGN ... On the
Skibo bulletin board is posted a 
petition asking that in future 
years, the Carnival Queen cam
paign be limited to a poster cam
paign except for a formal intro

basis. Someone added a post

freshman drarrtat, left Friday for 
Hollywood. She will portray the 
leading lady in Miranda, staged 
by a troupe under the direction of 
Florence Cunningham.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
. . . The Setonian, campus news
paper at Seton Hill, published 
samples of questions asked in en
trance exams. One question was, 
In the story we read, what was 
the authors purpose in making 
Franciscos mother a woman? Why 
wasnt his father also a woman?
COME ONE AND ALL . . . This 
year Carnival budget committee 
is soliciting campus organizat;ons 
to work as ticket-takers at the 
amusements. YWCA, Scimitars, 
and Mortar Board have volunteer
ed their services.
STRAYED FROM THE FOLD 
. . . One of Joe Stalins right hand 
men, the leader of the majority of 
the Russian labor unions, obtain
ed his masters in metallurgy from 
Carnegie Tech in 1933. He is Vallilli Keiznetsov.
COME AGAIN? . . . An alumni 
dropped down to see Mr. Robert 
Savin in the Placements Bureau 
office, which has been redecorat
ed in fine wood paneling. The for
mer student remarked, Nice place 
you have here; when are you go

A student, no doubt.
CAP-TION . . . Who is the man

Carnival Recaps Half-Century
Thetas Elect Three 
To Court of Seven
Benny Goodman. While in col
lege Lund won six letters and 
was nominated by sports writers 
to the Little All American eleven. 
Before and after his three year 
and a half year stay in the Navy, 
Lund sang for Benny Goodman 
and was awarded a best in 
Downbeats annual poll. He is 
now under contract with MGM 
in Hollywood.
Raves Followed 
Milton Starrs orchestra, which 
will accompany Lund, has recent
ly played every major college on 
the eastern seaboard with rave 
notices following each perform
ance. An evidence of Starrs mu
sicianship is found in the fact 
that his orchestra played 21 coast - 
to-coast programs a week for 
three years with CBS.
Walt Harper, filling the number 
two spot on Saturday nights pro
gram, is well remembered by CIT 
students for his performances at 
the last Homecoming and the 1948 
Spring Carnival as well as many 
fraternity dances during the last 
year. Harper is known for his 
willingness to play anything the 
crowd desires.
Radio Star 
Having written and directed 
two Scotch n Soda shows while 
a CIT music student, Jack Pur
cell is well acquainted with Car
nival celebrators desires and is 
sure to provide the best in danceable music for the Friday night 
street dance. The bands fea
tured vocalist, Bette Smiley is 
the radio star of The Gift Shop 
of the Air, heard daily on WCAE.
CARNIVAL COURT
Pictured above are six of the seven campus beauties who will 
reign over Carnival weekend. One of their number will be crowned 
Queen during: the ceremony on Friday, May 12, in the Sylvan Theater. 
Standing (left to right): Sally Hutchinson, Dotty Kaye, Linda Cowan, 
Dotty Romito. Seated: Margie Weaver, Jean Miller. Katy Murphy 
was unable to attend.
With a clean sweep of the Spring Carnival Queen election, 
Kappa Alpha Theta elected all three of their candidates to the seven 
women court as a tremendous week of campaigning was brought
to an official close.
The Thetas, oniy sorority able to 
place more than one woman 
among the select, could not yet 
lay claim to the queens title. The 
honor, however, will go to one 
of the seven at the carnival cor
onation ceremony.
Flames and Rockets
Sally Hutchinson of Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, Dotty Kaye of 
Alpha Epsilon Phi, Jeanie Miller 
of Chi Omega, and Dotty Romito 
of Delta Gamma combined with 
the three Theta winners, Linda 
Cowan, Catherine Murphy and 
Marge Weaver, to comprise the 
court from which the queen shall 
be taken.
Everything from marines to indians plagued the men of the 
campus during the past week as 
18 candidates made bids for the 
court. Radio announcers, flames, 
rockets, and just about every
thing imaginable came into play 
as the women went all out to elect 
their candidates.
Colored Dresses
The successful Thetas whisked 
their three entrants into the cam
paign dressea in abbreviated reel 
dresses while their sorority sis
ters put on similar yellow cos
tumes. Their flame' campaign 
brought Rege Cordic, Bill Heinz, 
fire engines, and sex onto the 
campus.
Miss Cowan, recently named 
ROTC honorary colonel and 
Dream Girl of PiKA, and Miss 
Murphy, former honorary ROTC 
officer, were presented along with 
Private Weaver to the battalion 
on Thursday.
In a modern trend Delta Gam
ma used a race to the moon as 
the ground work for the rocket 
campaign giving away Spring 
Carnival tickets to the winners. 
In somewhat the same vein, Alpha 
Epsilon Phi presented their lone 
candidate, Dotty Kaye, to the 
campus as the woman of the half 
century. A fashion show and 
amazing Charleston dance started 
things which were quite ade
quately wound up by the candi
dates appearance.
Wild Indians
Kappa Kappa Gamma reverted 
to an entirely different idea, how
ever, to attract the male vote. 
An Indian uprising, which started 
in an already disrupted Skibo, 
never stopped until every frater
nity found one of its members 
captured and tied to some con
venient tree. A daring rescue act 
by the Kappa candidates brought 
the hostilities to an end.
Equally successful was the Chi 
Omegas detachment of marines 
and bagpipe serenade which 
helped Jeanie Miller into one 
of the coveted spots.
All of which added up to a 
highly successful campaign on all 
counts and has brought to Car
negie one of its most glamorous 
courts.

Meeting Called Today 
For Interested People
In preparation for the schedul
ing of next yeai^ social events, 
Student Council's plans and pro
grams committee Has called a 
meeting of all interested persons 
at the TX house tonight at 4:30 
to determine why attendance is 
low at some all-school dances.
Elections chairman Bob Carpen
ter requested an extension to last 
Friday for the Council petition 
deadline. A check of the enroll
ment of the colleges showed that 
E & S should elect ten representa
tives; Fine Arts, three, and MMCC, three. *
Need All Present
Losing the quorum at 5 oclock, 
president Koester emphasized the 
need for everyone attending the 
coming meetings. Several import
ant matters such as the social cal
endar will be brought up.
One of the questions that will 
have to be decided for the next 
school year is whether to have six 
or five all-school dances. Jack 
Stewart, social chairman, pointed 
out that three of the six dances 
this year fell between February 25 and May 3.
Conflicting fraternity parties are 
not the cause of the low attendance.
Fraternits Attend
A survey of the students at
tending dances last year showed 
that 80 percent of the men were 
fraternity men. This dropped to 
between 60 and 70 percent for the 
Penny a Pound dance, and the 
dance failed, said Fred Lunt.
Art Zuch believed Council was 
responsible for the organizations 
losing money. When CouniImen 
approve a dance, they only in
sider if there are conflicting dates, 
never noticing if there are dances week after week.
The Dean of Men suggested the 
Councils budget receive a share 
of all dance profits, since it has to cover all losses.

CIT Intramural Softball Begins; 
Theta Xi Downs Tau Delts 10-6
Intramural softball started this week, and the prospects of a 
good season are very evident. Good weather in the ensuing weeks 
should help to provide an exciting season on the CIT diamond.
In one of the first games of the season, the Architects again 
showed evidence of their strength * 
by defeating a weaker Newman
club 18-0. Strong batting on the 
part of the Archs won the major 
portion of the contest.
Pitchers Duel
On last Thursday the teams of 
Theta Xi and Tau Delta Phi 
staged a fine exhibition of a 
pitchers duel for 5% innings. 
Daryl Meyers, Theta Xis pitcher, 
lost some of his control and al
lowed six runs to cross the plate.
Len Smollen also ran into a 
spell of wildness; and after al
lowing the TXs to score four 
runs in three innings, he gave up 
a hit to open the last half of the 
sixth inning. Smollen then

Art Christopher hit a ball into 
left field that was carried out of 
the fielders reach by the wind 
for a grand slam homer. This 
made the score 8-6, and before 
Smollen was able to retire the 
side, two more runs had scored, 
ending the scoring at 10-6.
In the Faculty Bulldog-Metals 
club game, Snyder and Sargeant 
Brown also staged a pitchers 
duel, which finally ended up with 
the Metals club on top by the 
count of 4-2.
Intramural Soccer Season Open 
Eight Games Played In Mud
I '
Phi kaps Lose To Delts In Overtime Match; 
AT O, Betas, Sigma Nu Also Record Wins
During the past week' the intramural soccer program went into 
high gear with the playing of eight scheduled games. Although the 
rain-soaked fields made conditions very muddy, the spirit of the
? games was not hampered.
In one of the tightest games ofCarnegie Athletic 
Board Outlaws 
Nebraska Game
At its meeting last week the 
Athletic Board voted by a 10-2 
count to refuse the invitation of 
the University of Nebraska to open 
their 1950 home football season on 
September 23rd with a game at 
Lincoln. The only two favorable 
votes were cast by student repre
sentatives on the Board.
It was felt by the Board that 
Carnegie was stepping out of its 
class in playing against such bigtime competition. It was felt that 
it would be advisable to continu 
to play Class B football tearAs in 
view of the record attained last 
year.
The opinion was expressed by 
the Board that as the 1950 sched
ule is made up at this time, the 
Tartans are in a position to win 
the first four games. Many felt 
that should they be badly defeat
ed in this first game the morale 
of the players would suffer for the 
following games.
Tartan Tennis Team 
Hosts Geneva College
The Plaid tennis team opens the spring tennis season to
morrow against Geneva College at the Carnegie Tech Courts. The 
matches are scheduled to begin at 1:30.
Since the conditioning of the courts has been delayed by un
seasonable weather, the Carnegie*
racqueteers will be beginning the 
season almost without practice. 
Due to the lack of opportunity to 
view the team in action, Coach 
Moses has made no definite start
ing assignments as yet.
Coach Moses does have six lettermen returning  Shoemaker, 
Montstream, Moon, McConnell, 
Bassett, and Beckerrwho should 
prove to be the mainstays of the 
team. Two promising freshmen, 
Wiederhorn and Lotta, are ex
pected to provid strong support 
if they continue their flashy early 
season form.
Coach Moses outlook for the 
coming season is fairly optimistic 
except for the matches against 
Pitt and Duquesne.

After this close victory of two 
days before, the Delts lost in an
other close game to Beta Theta

by both teams.
Theta Xi also had two impor

put up a good fight, were hurt by

Carnegie Trackmen Defeat 
Grover Runners, 73-58
The recent refusal of the Carnegie Athletic Board to 
sanction the proposed football game with the University 
of Nebraska has caused an extremely unfavorable reaction 
among the members of the football team, as well as among 
the majority of the students. As its reasons for prohibiting 
the playing of the game, the Board has stated that the team 
would be stepping out of its class and going back into big 
time football, and that an overwhelming defeat in this game 
could very possibly ruin the morale of the players for the 
following games.
Granted that Nebraska is somewhat out of our class, 
it is doubtful that the Cornhuskers are too much'stronger 
than is Lehigh, a team that is still on the Carnegie schedule. 
That the game would mark a return to big time football is 
a gross exaggeration, as is evident from a glance at the 1950 
schedule. In regard to the team, it was aware of the strength 
of the opposition and certainly didnt figure on having an 
easy afternoon.
The real reasons behind the Athletic Board veto stem from 
President Dohertys remark that the administration' was against 
playing the game, and from the statement by the two alumni 
memberstwo of the largest contributors to the Steffan Fund 
that they would stop donating money for athletic scholarships if 
the game was played. With the exception of the student repre
sentatives, what choice did the Board members have?
What the Board failed to consider is whether their refusal 
, ot allow the game would have a more adverse psychological 
affect on the team than would a decisive defeat at the hands 
of Nebraska. Also, the game at Lincoln would have meant 
a sizeable monetary gain by the Athletic Department, which 
certainly is in need of cash. The administration knew this. 
The alumni members of the Board might consider the fact 
that their Steffan Fund dollars could very possibly be put 
to better use as a result of the game, since it is much easier 
to attract talented high school football players if the schedule 
contains an occasional big game.
Occasional is the word to be used in reference to class A 
teams. This writer is definitely in favor of the present policy 
of playing small college football. However, one or two games 
against larger college teams each season can be extremely bene
ficial to the school as well as to the team. Here is one instance 
.where the Athletic Board had an opportunity to realize these 
advantages but instead fumbled the ball.

Jim Andrews 
Places In Six 
* Of Seven Events
By Bob Lynch
Jim Andrews proved to be the 
spark on Carnegie Techs track 
and field team as the Plaidmen 
upset Grove City 73-58 Saturday 
in the Skibo Bowl.
Andrews placed in six of seven 
events to total 15 points while 
Connie Hammann and football 
players Johnny Luchok and Fritz 
Wilson accounted for 26% addi
tional points. The Skibos showed
weakness in the weight events as 
the Wolverines swept the three 
contests for 22 of the 27 points.
Wilson Improves 
Trailing the Grovers in the 
earlier events, a first place by 
Connie Hammann in the low hur
dles and a first place by Fritz Wil
son in the 220 placed the Carnegie 
men in the lead. Wilson showed 
improvement for the second week 
in a row as he lumbered around 
the track in 23.0 seconds.
Grove City made a complete 
sweep of the discus event and 
again moved ahead, but a first 
place in the low hurdles by Jim 
Andrews and a tie for first place 
in the high jump by Andrews and 
Hammann moved the Plaid ahead. 
Andrews also placed second in the 
javelin throw and third in the 
broad jump, high hurdles, and 
shot put.
Cop Relay
The high point of the meet 
occurred just before the 4/5 mile 
relay as Halfertys thinclads held 
a 7 point lead. The relay and 
broadjump remained, and a first 
place in either one was necessary 
to win the meet.
Speedy Bill McKibbin, having 
placed second in the 220, led off 
for Carnegie Tech obtaining a 
twenty foot lead as he passed the 
baton to George Dorman. Dorman 
failed to maintain this lead and 
tangled with the Grove City run
ner as they attempted to hand the 
baton in front of each other. Chuck 
Kurcina, losing to the Grover on 
the pass, closed the gap on the 
third lap, and Fred Price, running 
the final 1/5 mile, finished a few 
feet ahead of Grove City in a 
commendable 2.46 time.
With victory assured Carnegie 
Tech went ahead to win first and 
third place in the broadjump. 
Johnny Luchok took the honors 
with a 21'2" leap. Honors also 
went to John Cooper, who fin
ished the 2 mile in first place for 
the second week in a row with a 
10:57 mark.
The Carnegie Plaid took seven 
first place positions while the 
Grovers had six, and also took 
seven second places to their six. 
Dick Hettish and John Hiack 
showed outstanding performance 
for the Grovers. Hiack threw the 
javelin 166'10" to better Andrews 
by eight feet.
Kappa Sigs 
Easily Win IM 
Handball Title
Climaxing the intramural hand
ball season the winning teams of 
the two leagues played the cham
pionship match last Friday after
noon. Kappa Sigma defeated Delta 
Tau Delta to gain top laurels for 
the season.
Joe Pniewski, Kappa Sigma 
captain, displayed his usual cham
pionship caliber of play as he came 
from behind to defeat the Delt 
number one man, Roger Wiewel, 
by the score of 7-21, 21-5, 21-12. 
This victory kept Pniewski on the 
list of the undefeated.
In completing the Kappa Sigma 
championship drive Hank Thode, 
playing in the number two spot, 
won out over John Monstream 
for the necessary win. Although 
Thode won in two games, it was 
a battle all the way as Monstream 
fought viciously in the second 
game, trying to pull the match out 
of the fire. The finat score was
Jim Andrews, Carnegie Tech track and field star, is shown 
clearing the fourth hurdle during the 120-yard high hurdles in

event, which was won by Connie Hammann, but countered by win

Campus History Sports 
Skeleton in the Closet
by Ivan Sturman
This fair campus, now a respectable seat or learning, has al
most reached its golden anniversary. But there are skeletons in 
the closet of campus history. Perhaps the most unusual is to be
found in Engineering Hall. ?-------------------- -------------------------
Deep in its subierranean passj 
ages we enter Room 10D in the ' 
southeast corner of the building. I 
The first thing that strikes us 1 
is a door marked, Danger Keep ,
Out. Being speculative people ' 
we wonder what could be behind 
it. Can it be a despository for 
demented pedagogues or delirious 
disciples of the Carnegie Plan, or 
maybe a hiding place for fugi
tives from Danny Frank's fresh
men crew? Do all the students 
who dont return in the fall grad
uate? Enough of these sinister 
implications and 'forbodings.
No Bartender 
Opening the door we find it 
conceals the usual hole in the 
wall, only this one doesn't come 
equipped with the bartender, 
spittoons, and television. As we 
enter to examine more closely, we 
whip out our folding pocket ruler 
and make a mental note of the 
hole's dimensions: approximately 
6 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 120 
feet long. Scrutinizing the walls 
and ceiling, we see that they are 
supported by rust encrusted beams 
with cast concrete between them.
After crawling over some pipe 
stored there by the chemical en
gineering department, we find 
that the concrete walls and ceil
ing end about halfway down the 
tunnel. Shining our flashlights 
around, we see that the ceiling 
suppoits are still steel beams, but 
now it is evident that the tunnel 
is cut out of rock. The floor is 
muddy and slippery. Here is what 
seems to be a small pool. Oopsslipped and darn near fell in!

What Happened?
Just how did all this happen; 
were people digging for dinosaur 
iosiles, diamonds, or dirt?
An inquiry around campus re
vealed that following the first 
World War, the school instituted 
a course in mining, later combined 
with the metallurgy department. 
eifc^-Supplies and equipment were doMr. od or loaned by manufacturing 
servf^npanies. During the course of 
b instruction and demonstration, the 
/ students dug out the mine and 
used 400 feet of narrow gauge 
track. The result was a complete 
small scale mine, including even 
a mining mule, a low battery 
powered vehicle that pulls the 
cars loaded with whatever is be
ing mined, in this case rocks.
At one time, local mining com
panies sent their foremen here 
for a short summer training 
course. The mining course was 
dropped in 1932 or 33. Since it 
would involve a waste of funds 
and energy to fill the hole in the 
wall, all the machinery was re
turned, the track was dug up, a 
door put on the entrance, and 
there it sits. Maybe it could be 
used to grow mushrooms for Skibo.

knowledge that he broke under 
the strain of searching frantically 
for a place to design the shows 
costumes. Now he sits in Skibo 
by the hour and cries pathetically.
Dave Clark exhibits also the 
definite beginnings of a deranged 
mind. He states that he no longer 
sleeps or eats, that he often talks 
to himself, and that he has a 
tendency to jump off bridges. Un
fortunately his condition seems 
to be getting worse. This past 
week, several fellow students 
have suffered mysterious black 
eyes and broken limbs after men
tioning Scotch and Soda to him.
The last member of our cheer
ful group, Bob Larimer, who was 
^not available for the picture, was

against a piano in the Fine Arts 
building. Not the least of his 
troubles as music arranger for 
the show was the first orchestra 
rehearsal for which five out of 
thirty showed up. Now Bob says 
things like that no longer bother 
him. He just thinks pityingly of 
the next board.

INQUIRING REPORTER
Why Do School Dances 
Fail to Draw Students?
An important question has been raised by Student Council: 
Why do so many all-school dances fail? Is it lack of publicity, 
or ill-timing? Just what is the answer? Students, Council wants
and asks for your opinions. *__________________________________
Gene Sappex-, junior: All
school dances in the gym have 
been losing money because of a 
great lack of 
i student sup 
port. Thei 
v. seems to be a 
question as to 
i| which group of 
|& students is delinquent;. In my 
opinion, it is 
the commuters 
who do not 
think it worth
while to come 
to the gym for a dance. Still, not
all dances lose money which
shows that when the dance is 
properly publicized, it is a suc
cess. Maybe the solution is to have 
fewer but bigger and better all
school dances.
Starke Drischell, senior: All
school dances are not successful 
because of 
basic lack of 
social a w a reness on this 
campus. Deco
rations, public
ity are not the 
answer. The 
functions are 
sporadic; there 
is not a cons i s t ent social 
life here unless 
a person belongs to a fraternity. 
Other men cannot find enough 
social activities to interest them; 
therefore, when a dance comes up, 
there is no response from these 
men. They are used to going else
where for social affairs.
Connie Shan
ahan, fresh
man: I really 
dont know 
why all-school 
dances dont go 
over. I always 
like them and 
the freshmen 
seem to like 
the gym for 
dances. I dont 
think that 
enough publicity is given to the 
affairs.
Laura Ehni, junior: All-school 
dances often fail because they are 
held in the gym and come at times 
when people are broke and cant 
There a^orc* - There is not enough 
interest between different campus 
groups to make 
students want 
to go and see 
everyone. Campus groups 
dont care 
whet her the 
other dan ces 
are a succes as 
long as theirs 
is. Stud j nts 
wouldnt supp o r t the
dances; still, there is an attempt 
to have something going on all the 
time.
Dick Shaffer, senior: All
school dances fail because, first 
of all, too many are scheduled at 
the wrong 
time; they con
flict with frater nity plans.
The gym is a 
factor, too. I 
know some 
people who 
wouldnt go be
cause a dance 
is held in the 
gym. The pres
ent scheme 
seems to be to have one dance a 
month. The trouble is that this is 
an urban school and there is so 
much else to do.
Why do all-schol dances fail? 
This is a question that must be 
answered both for the groups who 
sponsor such dances and those 
who want to attend them. Think 
it over, students. What is your an
swer?

North Carolina State College, there 
is always a friendly crowd of stu

where, ice-cold Coca-Cola helps

News
And
Views
This bit of homey news will be 
a little weak due to the absence 
of its author, Frank Mihelich. 
Franks mother has been serious
ly ill, so he is spending his free 
hours at home. We extend our best 
wishes for a speedy recovery to 
Mrs. Mihelich.
It was quite satisfying to see 
Mike Gittens receive the evening 
student achievement award at the 
Evening College of Engineering 
and Science banquet. To Mike go 
our congratulations and our hopes 
for continuing success. Mike will 
graduate this spring.
The proper thing to do is to 
give the hurrahs this week in the 
direction of Leroy Rowland and 
Charles Heller, co-chairman of the 
banquet. However, we would like 
to know if the gag raj^J on the 
floor show was the work of Chuck 
or Leroy. We are of the opinion 
that there were some who thought 
it was the real McCoy.
Saturday evening, May 6, will 
be your last chance to support 
Evening Student Council this se
mester. It is the evening of the 
Spring Dance, and tickets are on 
sale at $2.25 each. Council de
serves your support for the ex
cellent way they have performed 
their duties this past vear.
As an afterthought on the ban
quet, it certainly was surprising 
to see how many people were lit 
upreferring to the number of 
flashbulbs popped by the many 
camera fiends present, of course.
It is in the wind that the Sigma 
Delta Phi members are polishing 
up their golf clubs and taking a 
few practice swings in the livingroom in preparation for their an
nual golf party.
Also, it would be advisable to 
stay downwind of Ray Schwalm 
on July 9. Ray is going to supply 
fresh fish for a fish fry to be 
held in North Park. This is also 
a fraternity affair.
In closing, we might mention 
that a few fair breezes heralding 
the coming of summer are already 
causing heads to waver over text
books.

Benny and his orchestra have filled engagements for numerous

The fraternities and the soroi rity have been invited to lend 
! their support toward making this 
1 dance a grand success. The rej sponse has been very encouraging.

I volunteered to spend additional 
time contacting students in Indus
tries Hall each evening this week. 
Tickets may be procured from 
them, from Mr. McKelway, or 
from members of Evening Stu
dent Council.
Each of the first 100 girls who 
attend will be presented with a 
flower, and a door prize has been 
offered by Jim Frape. ^
The dance is being held on 
Saturday evening, May 6, and 
the price of admission is $2.25. 
All students, day and evening, 
are cordinally invited to attend 
and to bring their friends.
Sincere thanks are extended to 
Mrs. Byron May and to Eetty 
Zielinskis brother for the post
ers that they made. Both posters 
are worthy of high commendation.

Fifty Grand 
Opens April 29 
At Playhouse
The latest edition of the Play
house musical revues entitled 
Fifty Grand opens on April 29. 
This musical revue has a cast of 
Playhouse veterans and some com
pletely new additions to the stage.
Ken Welch, who wrote the mu
sic and lyrics together with David 
Crantz, who did the sketches, has 
written the musical numbers 
around a central theme. Beginning 
in 1900 and ending in 1950, the 
musical tells the story of the first 
half of the century. Because of 
the scope of 50 years, composer 
Welch has written the music to 
fit each of the different areas protrayed.
