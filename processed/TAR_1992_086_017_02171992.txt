Discrimination resolution brought to vote today
L RHONDA STRUMINGER
Vartan Contributing Editor
By voting today in the referenlum being held by Student Sen^e, students will have the op)ortunity to voice their opinion 
in the Resolution Against Disrimination by ROTC at CamigieMellon. Located in front of
he Fence or, in case of rain, in
Baker Hall, the referendum will 
ask students to express their 
support of or objection to the 
resolution.
The purpose of the referen
dum is for Student Senate to 
determine the opinion of stu
dents on the matter, and to use 
this information to aid in its 
decision to rescind or keep the 
resolution. Therefore, the num
ber of students who vote will 
directly affect the validity of the 
CMU referendum as a tool which 
gives students direct control over 
decisions being made by their 
Student Senate. There will be 
several copies of the resolution 
at the referendum site for stu
dents to read.
The referendum is basically 
an opinion poll, and is non-bind
ing. So Student Senate has to 
decide to what degree the refer
endum is representative of the 
campus, said Campus Affairs 
Chair Erik Altmann. So if 3500 
people, half the campus, came 
out Monday and said no, we 
dont want this resolution to 
stand, I suspect that Senate 
would rescind the resolution. 
However, Altmann believes
the resolution is important. I 
would still support the resolu
tion because equal rights arent 
popular. It was the Supreme 
Court that desegregated the 
buses, it wasnt Congress... Nev
ertheless, I think there are prob
ably a number of people on Sen
ate whose opinions will follow 
campus opinion to the extent 
that if they are absolutely posi
tive that students dont want 
this, then they will vote to re
scind it.
Past elections and referen
dums have always drawn votes 
from less than 10 percent of the 
campus. According to Academic 
Affairs Chair Mike Tomblyn, To 
be statistically valid, 50 percent 
of the campus or 3500 students

Brian Papa was elected Acivities Board (AB) Chair last 
Monday despite confusion surounding candidates eligibility 
equirements.
Problems arose when AB disovered that the constitution it 
iad been operating under since 
all 90 had never been ratified 
Student Senate. Senate 
stepped in to officiate elections 
md enforce the ratified constit
ution when an unnamed indiridual informed Senate that AB 
nember at large Jen Gaspari 
mild be ineligible under the 
inratified constitution. The 
Mpy [of the constitution] we have 
m file that was ratified was not 
vhat AB was using, said Stulent Senate Chair Chris Neighwr.
We thought it had been ratiied, said current AB Chair 
Srik Nightwine. Apparently it 
ras lost.
ABs old constitution allowed 
inyone sponsored by a member
of the Executive Committee to 
run for the top position while 
the new constitution requires 
that candidates for the position 
of Chair be current members of 
the Executive Committee or 
members of any of AB's commit
tees for at least a year.
According to Bonnie Gorman, 
assistant director of student ac
tivities and AB advisor, the new. 
constitution was drafted in the 
summer of 90 to become effec
tive for in fall 90 semester.
Were still wondering how it 
happened, Neighbor said. Ac
cording to him, Senate imple
mented a full-scale investiga
tion of AB in the fall of1990. The 
investigation, prompted by wor
ries that AB was becoming too 
exclusive, resulted in a number 
of changes to ABs constitution. 
Accordingto Neighbor, ABs new 
constitution does reflect some of 
Senates changes. We have no 
real problems with the new con
stitution.
The new constitution should 
be ratified this week, said 
Nightwine.

Faculty Senate investigates ROTC
By ALIM RAY
Tartan News Co-Editor
Hearings addressing 
ROTC on CMUs campus 
sponsored by the Human Re
lations Commission will be 
held every other week start
ing next Monday until all par
ties are heard from.
All student organizations 
which have an opinion on the 
issue are invited to send a repre
sentative with a written decla
ration of the organizations opin
ion. Organizations without pa
pers can still contribute to the 
hearings through discussion.
We would like to invite every 
group that feels strongly on the
issue, Otto Davis, president of 
the Human Relations Commit
tee said. We want to hear all 
viewpoints because we would 
like to write a position paper. 
The commission will make the 
position paper public and report 
its findings to the Faculty Sen
ate Executive Board, which for
mally requested an investigation in January, and Presi
dent Robert Mehrabian.
The commission is a per
manent body consisting of 15 
administrators, students, 
and faculty members, who, 
according to Davis handle 
issues... that involve Univer
sity policy that some people 
might not think is correct.

The Civil Engineering Depart
ment began its recovery last 
week after its computers fell vic
tim to an international breakin. A SUN workstation was al
legedly tapped into by a group of 
five or six people working out of 
the Netherlands.
Although it is still unclear as 
to what the group was looking
for, or ___________________
even 
how far 
into Carn e g i e 
Mellons 
systems 
they got, 
both the 
FBI and 
the Computer Emergency Response 
Team (CERT) based at the Soft
ware Engineering Institute 
(SEI) have begun investigations.
Said Donna Fillo, business 
manager for civil engineering, 
I understand [the FBI] has ap
prehended the ring, and we are 
going to prosecute.
Repairs began two weeks ago, 
when the civil engineering ma
chines simply stopped working 
and the SEI was called to inves
tigate. The assailants reportedly 
planted a trojan horse, de
signed to break into other sys
tems, a program conceivably 
lending them access to any Car
negie Mellon computer system.
The SEI and CERT are releas
ing little information while the 
investigation continues, but civil 
engineering professor Dan
Rehak said, The overall extent 
of the break-in could conceiv
ably be anywhere from a single 
computer to the entire network, 
although that is highly unlikely. 
Damage estimates have been set 
at anywhere from $1000 to 
$16000, depending on the dam
age to the host machine and cost 
of repair.
The Civil Engineering Depart
ment itself seems to have es
caped the incident with mini__________________ mal dam
age. The 
computer 
is in for re
pairs and 
we lost 
the mail 
system 
for the 
whole dement, said Fillo, but I think 
only one senior project was on 
the machine.
For security reasons, the SEI 
is not giving information out as 
to how the actual break-in was 
accomplished, but Rehak is con
fident that the holes created 
by the entry have been filled and 
new security steps have been 
taken. They reconfigured the 
system with new passwords, and 
Im sure similar steps have been 
taken in other departments, 
said Rehak.
The hackers were able to con
tact CMU systems over the 
Internet system, an interna
tional network to which most of 
CMUs computers are connected. 
I dont think [SEI] is going to 
tell even us how far things have 
progressed, Rehak said.areer Week 92 begins with A Slice of Life conference
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan News Co-Editor
Career Week 92 was kicked 
iff Saturday with A Slice of Life, 
program for juniors and 
seniorson life skills. This was 
the beginning of the second an
nual Career Week, the theme of 
which is Invest in Your Fu
ture.
A Slice of Life featured over a 
iozen Carnegie Mellon alumni 
who gave ten different presen
tations on life skills to help stu
dents in their transition into a 
career. According to Tamara 
Hale, associate director of 
alumni relations, the strongest 
sessions were Investing for Be
ginners, Marketing Yourself, 
Assertiveness and Communica
tion, and Money Management. 
These are life skills, said Hale.
Approximately 200 students 
participated in the program. A 
Slice of Life originated two years 
ago as an idea in an Alumni
Association Executive Board 
Committee and was integrated 
with Career Week the following 
year.
Career Week is coordinated 
by the Career Center and is spon
sored by 29 organizations. Were 
really glad to have such a di
verse group of people sponsor
ing [Career Week], said Career 
Center Assistant Director John 
Michalenko.
Theres so much going on, 
said Michalenko, notingthat the
programs range from the Com
ing Corporations discussion of 
diversity in the work force to 
studying art abroad. Its geared 
to everybody from the freshman 
level to the PhD [level], said 
Michalenko. Although many of 
the programs are aimed to help 
juniors and seniors cope with 
career decisions, some are de
signed to assist underclassmen 
also, such as Summer Employ
ment 92, which looks at sum
mer job hunting.
Career Week began last year 
with 39 programs sponsored by
25 organizations, and has grown 
to a week of 45 programs spon
sored by 29 organizations. The 
event was created to cater to 
students needs concerning ca
reer decisions. SaidMichalenko, 
We decided that we needed to 
be more innovative for the stu
dents. According to Michal
enko, most students are not 
aware of the vast number of 
choices they have at graduation.
Career Week is designed to 
give all students the opportu
nity to explore and make deci
sions aboutdiverse career fields. 
The week also examines oppor
tunities in research, graduate 
school, and careers abroad, as 
well as career related issues and 
their impact on society.
We hope that we can make it 
a tradition here that every Feb
ruary we have a week-long ex
travaganza of career issues, 
said Michalenko.

Tech Street obstruction may interfere with Buggy route
By ERIN GRUNZKE
Tartan Staffwriter
The recent construction on the 
new GSIA wing which entails 
the use of Tech Street and 
Schenley Drive may interfere 
with Hill One on the buggy route.
Fortunately, the buggy prac
tice schedule will not interfere 
with any of the construction crew 
work hours. Buggy Chair Alexis 
DePlanque said, Were not sure 
what effect the big machinery 
will have on the road conditions; 
nevertheless, we dont anticipate 
any problems because of the con
struction.
Assistant Dean of GSIA 
Sandra Mawhinney said, I hope 
it doesnt have any impact on 
the buggy practice route or free 
rolls. Well have to work with 
the coordinators and Turner 
Construction, who is handling 
the construction management, 
and relay the message that 
Buggy takes priority here. 
Any Buggy changes will be 
posted on organizational 
bboards or the official, cmu-news 
bboard. The bboards will in
clude any important informa
tion the push teams and coordi
nators need to know. Said Assis
tant Director of Public Relations
Anne Witchner, So far weve 
been on top of things and there 
havent been any problems.
According to DePlanque, the 
itinerary is still on schedule with 
Spring Freerolls which began 
on February 15. The freerolls 
will continue on successive week
ends through April 5.
No unexpected problems have 
occurred primarily because the 
construction company is not 
working during buggy practice. 
As Mawhinney said, Well shut 
down the construction on the 
day of the races if need be. The 
most important thing is that the 
buggy races go on.

Search and seizure ruling may go to Supreme Court
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (DJ)  A 
search and seizure ruling may set the 
stage for a Supreme Court battle, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.
A federal appeals court in Cincinnati 
ruled that once a person consents to a 
search by law enforcement officials, the 
. issue of whether the person was stopped 
because of racial bias is irrelevant. The 
decision by the 12-member U.S. Court 
of Appeals overturned a ruling by a 
panel of three judges, an unusual re
versal.
In the earlier opinion, the court ruled
that three plainclothes Memphis police 
officers violated the Fourth Amend
ment prohibition against illegal 
searches and the Fourteenth Amend
ment equal protection clause when it 
stopped Eddie Louis Taylor outside the 
Memphis International Airport.
Taylors attorney, Robert M. 
Friedman, said he will ask the U.S. 
Supreme Court to review the full-court 
decision. Friedman said Taylor never 
consented to being stopped and 
searched.
Taylor was the only African Ameri
can to leave a plane that had arrived 
from Miami. Taylor, who was sentenced 
to 63 months in prison for intent to sell 
cocaine, had argued that the evidence 
in the case cannot be used because he 
was illegally stopped and searched.
The issue of whether drug enforce
ment officials stop minorities, particu
larly African-Americans, solely because 
of their race has been much debated in 
recent years.
Eleven years ago, the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in New York rejected 
the use of a race-based drug courier
profile. Last November, a suit seeking 
class action status was filed by drug 
and alcohol counselor J. LeWayne Kelly 
against the Austin Police Department, 
which he alleged has a search policy 
that discriminates against minorities.
In the decision by the full appeals 
court early this week, Judge Robert B. 
Krupansky wrote that since Taylor had 
consented to be searched, the court 
didnt have to consider whether the 
officers surveillance of Taylor was 
motivated to any degree by his race or 
whether the use of race as a component
in a drug courier profile would violate 
an individuals rights to due procesa 
and equal protection of the laws.
Judge Damon Keith, one of four dis
senting judges, wrote that the dispro
portionate number of African Ameri
cans who are stopped indicates that a 
racial imbalance against African 
Americans does exist and is implicitly 
sanctioned by the law enforcement 
agency.
Sidney P. Alexander, an assistant 
U.S. attorney in Memphis, declined t6 
comment.
Drift net policy approved
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 
(AP)  The House Ways and 
Means Committee approved a 
bill aimed at discouraging for
eign fishermen from employ
ing large drift nets that may 
harm birds, turtles, and other 
forms of marine life that arent 
being commercially harvested.
The bill would authorize 
mandatory duties on imports 
of fish products and sportsfishing equipment from coun
tries that allow their fisher
men to continue using these 
nets after December 31. The 
date will mark the start of an 
international moratorium on 
drift net fishing called for by 
the United Nations. The bill, 
which was passed by a voice 
vote, also would deny violators 
the use of U.S. ports.
Representative Gerry Studds 
(D-Mass.), the bills principal 
author, said it would give the 
U.S. some leverage to enforce 
international fishery conservation programs. Japan, South 
Korea, and Taiwan are among 
the countries that have main
tained drift net fishing fleets.
The Studds bill was approved 
last October by the House Mer
chant Marine and Fisheries 
Committee, but because it in
volved trade policy, the bill also 
had to be endorsed by the Ways 
and Means Committee before 
going to the House for a floor 
vote. No comparable legisla
tion has passed in Senate.
Baker balks on Israeli loan
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (AP) 
 Secretary of State James 
Baker estimates Israel is build
ing 5,700 to 6,000 housing units 
on the West Bank and Gaza and 
wants to halt construction at 
that level, said sources familiar 
with negotiations on the matter.
Bakers estimate is far fewer 
than Israeli housing ministry 
claims of between 9,000 and 
13,000 units under construction. 
The discrepancy is significant
because Baker has indicated 
units already under construc
tion could actually be completed.
Baker is withholding approval 
of Israels year-old request for 
help in securing commercial 
bank loans of $10 billion as a 
means of stopping Israeli Jews 
from moving to the territories. 
The Arabs want Israel to pull 
back, and the Bush administra
tion terms Jewish settlements 
an obstacle to peace.
Israel intends to borrow $10 
billion from commercial banks 
whether or not the U.S. govern
ment guarantees the loans. If 
the U.S. co-signs the loans, how
ever, the terms including the 
interest rate would be much 
lower.
Israel needs the money to 
settle the thousands of refugees 
flooding the country from the 
newly independent countries of 
what was the Soviet Union.

Budget proposal deceptive
Plans long-term effect discourages savings
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (DJ)  The Bush 
administrations budget proposals could further 
undermine Americans incentives to put away 
money for their old age, some accountants and 
retirement experts are warning.
Several provisions of the Bush budget plan, like 
the new Flexible Individual Retirement Account, 
seem to make it easier for people to save for 
retirement. Thats a laudable goal, experts say, 
since many people think that Americans are sav
ing far too little now for their retirement.
But many financial advisers worry that the 
overall effect of the Bush plan would be to make it 
easier for people to withdraw and spend the money 
in their retirement accounts.
It would create a rush on retirement savings, 
says Joseph Piacentini, former research associate 
with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a 
non-partisan public policy research group in Wash
ington.
What many retirement specialists find espe
cially troubling is the potential combined impact 
of several of the Bush administration proposals. 
For example, letting first-time home buyers with
draw money from individual retirement accounts 
penalty-free and giving them a $5,000 tax credit 
could lead many lower and middle income people 
to strip their IRAs to finance a home purchase.
Criticizing the proposed loosening of withdrawal 
restrictions on IRAs, Representative Lewis Parker 
(D-Va.) said to administration officials at a Con
gressional hearing last week, You want to take 
the money out for health care. You want to take 
the money out for first-time home ownership. I 
want to look at something that gives people an 
incentive to save more money.
The contradictions within the Bush budget rose' 
to the surface when the Presidents economic 
advisers faced the House Ways and Means Com
mittee earlier this month. Representative Jim 
McDermott (D-Wash.) said to Michael Boskin, the 
Presidents chief economic adviser, Does the presi
dent want us to spend more or does he want us to 
save? What does he think is the best thing for 
America?
Boskins answer? Both. Over the long term, 
America needs to save more, he said. In an 
economy that is very stagnant, as the current 
economy is, obviously there is some incentive to 
get various types of spending.
The administration proposal appears to include 
a major new incentive to save: the FIRA. Individu
als with incomes up to $60,000 would be able to 
contribute $2,500 a year to the proposed FIRA; 
couples with incomes up to $120,000 could con
tribute $5,000. Earnings would grow tax-deferred.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (DJ)  Marine Corps 
leaders are quietly making a case to Congress 
that a Bush administration troop-reduction plan 
would overtax the Corps by forcing its seaborne 
soldiers to spend too much time deployed abroad.
General Carl Mundy, commandant of the Ma
rine Corps, has been making this argument in 
recent weeks to key members of Congress and to 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
The Marines is the only service openly fighting 
the administrations troop-cut plan, which would 
reduce the ranks of the Marine Corps from the 
current 192,000 to 159,100 by the end of1997. All
the services are being told to cut by roughly the 
same proportion over that period.
Mundy said the Marines believe they can afford 
to cut no lower than 176,000 if they are to keep all 
of their current duties, which include continuous 
deployments in the Persian Gulf area, the eastern 
Mediterranean, and the western Pacific.
Mundy stressed that the Marines already have 
a troop-cut plan to take them to 159,100 by 1997, 
and that they can still have a great Marine 
Corps at that level. But the Corps would be 
stretching its forces too thin if it were required to 
continue its current pace of overseas operations.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (AP) 
 President Bush said there is 
no linkage at all between cur
rent global trade talks and the 
U.S. - military presence in Eu
rope.
Theyre separate. These two 
issues are separate, Bush said 
after comments by Vice Presi
dent Quayle and Republican 
Senators in Germany were in
terpreted as a warning that the 
U.S. might reduce its North At
lantic Treaty Organization 
forces if the trade talks are not 
successfully concluded.
The current round of talks 
under GATT, the General Agree
ment on Tariffs and Trade, have 
been stalemated over U.S. de
mands for lowering high Euro
pean subsidies on domestic farm 
products.
On Monday Quayle denied 
that the U.S. would pull troops 
out of Europe if trade talks fail. 
But he did say during a stop in 
Geneva that there is linkage, if 
you will, between economic se
curity and military security, and 
it is importantthat the economic 
security be addressed, especially 
in the post-Cold War era.
Trade is a security issue, 
Quayle said.
Bush, when asked Tuesday if
the trade talks were also a secu
rity issue, said, Not at all, but 
theres been some confusion, 
Bush said when asked about the 
matter during a photo sessiqn 
with Turkish Prime Minister 
Suleyman Demirel.
It is important that we get a 
GATT agreement. Secondly, ... 
it is important that we set a 
strong NATO presence in Europe, he said.____________

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Jask Force releases report on 
campus alcohol problems
,A Presidential Task Force released a report to combat the abuse 
of alcohol on college campuses in Pennsylvania, which makes the 
following recommendations:
Colleges and universities should refuse to permit brewery com
pany advertising or sponsorship of events on their campuses.
The Federal government should exert control over the advertis
ing of alcoholic beverages on radio and television.
Every educational institution should set up housing alterna
tives, or wellness wings, free of alcohol, other substances, and 
(pbacco for interested students.
, The recommendations were included in a final report directed to 
the Federal government, released on February 10th by the Presi
dential Task Force On Substance Use Issues On Pennsylvania 
College And University Campuses. The task force was formed by 
the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU) 
two years ago at the request of the Secretary of the Pennsylvania
Department of Health.
The report urged higher education institutions to ban alcohol 
advertising in their publications and decline brewer sponsorship 
of sporting events on campus. The report also emphasized that all 
alcoholic beverage advertising be prohibited or regulated.
The study also called on the state to ban the retail sale of pure 
grain alcohol. According to the report, There is no legitimate need 
for the general public to have ready access to a drug used primarily 
by college students to spike the punch.
The Task Force report is believed to be the first statewide study 
done on drug abuse on college campuses.
PPG Industries rewards CMU
PPG Industries, Inc. awarded Carnegie Mellons Department of 
Social and Decision Sciences $5,000 for support of its information 
and decision systems (IDS) major.
The IDS program teaches students how to design and manage 
computer-based information systems within organizations. PPGs 
gift will be used for a variety of purposes, including hardware
equipment, software, course support, and a seminar series. This is 
the second year that PPG, an associate member of the IDS advisory 
board, has donated to the program.
Street Beat leaps into action
Street Beat Magazine will be sponsoring Leap into Action, an 
outdoor performance festival, at the William Pitt Union Lawn on 
February 29th. The festival will address the issues of homelessness, 
hunger, health care, and mental health.
Street Beat is a literary magazine and performance collective 
comprised of homeless, formerly homeless, and mental health 
consumers. Street Beat artists and various individuals from the 
arts community will perform their music, art, and poetry.
Many of the participants attending the festival will sleep out on 
the William Pitt Union Lawn until the following morning in 
cardboard shanties in order to show their solidarity with the 
homeless. Food and clothing will be collected at the site for dona
tions to local soup kitchens.

If you read three hundred issues of 
Superman or Spidcr-Man, they don't 
make sense as a story or a life. When I 
started Ccrcbus in 1977, uppermost in 
my mind was the thought that I wanted 
to produce 300 issues of a comic book 
series the way I thought it should be 
done; as one continuous story 
documenting the ups and down of a 
character's life. A series that would 
conclude with the death of the title 
character in the final issue."

dent Senate] are not trying to 
attack the cadets, otherwise they 
would have just said ROTC ca
dets can not participate in Car
nival. Instead, they are trying to 
attack the system and change 
the homosexual policy of ROTC 
and the DoD. But the writers of 
the resolution and possibly the 
majority of Senate are unwill
ing to change a single part of the 
resolution  such as the clause 
that states that we cannot par
ticipate in Student Senatefunded activities. I think it is all 
or nothing with them. 
According to Aitmann, The 
resolution was fairly carefully 
crafted to avoid targeting any
one who was an ROTC student
on this campus at this time. So, 
it requires them to join a stu
dent organization if they want 
to do booth, and I maintain that 
is simply putting them in the 
same bucket as everyone else on 
this campus.
We want ROTC to be on cam
pus ... discrimination free ... I 
actually see it [the referendum] 
as an opportunity for the cam
pus to support an end to discrimination on campus, said 
Aitmann. It will be an inter
esting exercise... the admin
istration will be watching, 
people who stand for equal 
rights on this campus will be 
watching, cmuOUT and gays 
and lesbians on campus will 
certainly be watchingbecause 
for them it is an issue of does 
the campus support their 
struggles?

their own votes.
At least two voting members 
of the Referendum Board must 
be at the polling place at all 
times. Should a vacancy exist, 
the polls shall be closed until 
such time as two voting mem
bers of the Referendum Board 
can be present.
Voting Procedure
A member of the Carnegie 
Mellon student body may vote 
by the following procedure:
1) Present valid photo identi
fication, preferably a Carnegie 
Mellon ID, to the pollsters (Ref
erendum Board members at the 
polling place).
2) The pollsters will check to 
ensure that the student is able 
to vote in the Referendum by 
checking the above mentioned 
alphabetical listing of students. 
If the student is not on the list, 
or another irregularity exists 
which the Referendum Board 
members present cannot adju
dicate, and the student allegates 
that they meet all of the criteria 
mentioned above then follow the 
procedure for double envelop
ing.
3) The pollsters will cross the 
students name off the alpha
betical list.
4) The pollsters will return 
the photo identification, along 
with one ballot and a copy of the 
resolution (Amended). At no 
time will the pollster touch the 
ballot after the vote has been 
cast.
5) The stock of unused ballots 
shall be kept secure at all times.
Double Enveloping
In some cases, information is 
not readily available to the poll
ster pertaining to Referendum
procedure, the status of a stu
dent, or other subjects which, in 
their opinion throw doubt upon 
the validity of the individual 
vote. In these cases, the deci
sion of validity shall be deter
mined at the time when all votes 
are counted.
The procedure in these cases 
is to be as follows: The pollsters 
should give the voter two enve
lopes. The voter should then 
seal his ballot in one of the enve
lopes, then seal the first enve
lope in the second envelope, onto 
which the pollsters should write 
the voter's name and student ID 
number, along with the pollsters 
name and a description of the 
problem. This is then put into 
the ballot box.
Ballot Counting
Ballot counting will be per
formed by the Chairman of the 
Referendum Board, or another 
he may name to act in his place, 
and four other voting members 
of the Referendum Board, within 
24 hours of the Referendum, 
preferably immediately after the 
closing of the polls, in the pres
ence of at least one member of 
the Department of Student Af
fairs and up to two non-voting 
observers from the Referendum 
Board, preferably one in favor of

fraternities after several alco
hol complaints, an officer ob
served a group of individuals on 
an outside porch with cups of 
beer in their possession. As the 
officer approached the house 
several individuals dropped the 
beer and some went into the 
house. The president of the 
house will be issued a Carnegie 
Mellon citation for the outside 
alcohol through the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
2/7 UNAUTHORIZED VE
HICLE, 8:18 pm. A silver Mazda 
was seen parked in front of 
Doherty Hall. Two officers en
countered the driver of the car, 
who was a pizza delivery per
son. He said he was delivering 
pizza to Doherty Hall and he 
thought the main Cut sidewalk 
was a driveway. An officer was 
also informed that the driver 
was seen driving at a high rate 
of speed on Margaret Morrison 
street and also driving quickly 
down the Cut. The driver was 
informed that while driving on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus he 
is to obey the speed limits and 
would be cited if found driving 
on the Cut or sidewalks.
2/7 HARASSMENT BY 
COMMUNICATION, 11:47 
pm. A Carnegie Mellon student 
called the Campus Police and 
said he has been getting harass

turn down the fucking music. 
The caller called back twice and 
also made racial slurs during 
the calls.
2/8 POWER OUTAGE, 7:59
pm. The entire Carnegie Mellon 
campus experienced a power 
outage that lasted approxi
mately 5 seconds. An assess
ment of the campus showed that 
power was restored to all build
ings except Mellon Institute, 
which was operating under 
emergency power. Duquesne 
Light Company was contacted 
and said that the outage was 
caused by a cable failure.
Duquesne Light technicians 
were dispatched to Mellon Insti
tute to switch the building to an 
alternate circuit. Environmen
tal Health and Safety and Physi
cal Plant were notified. Full 
power was restored to Mellon

FORUM
Cast your vote today
Today the Resolution Against 
Discrimination by ROTC at Car
negie Mellon, passed by Student 
Senate last November, goes to a 
referendum. The resolution con
demns the hypocrisy of the Uni
versity in allegedly violating its 
Statement of Assurance by al
lowing the ROTC program on 
campus.
It also calls for the removal of 
ROTC from Carnegie Mellon by 
the 1995-96 academic year un
less the Department of Defense 
changes its policy barring gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals from the 
military and from ROTC pro
grams.
The issue has been the catalyst 
for a great deal of debate and 
some interesting side effects, 
such as the successful write-in 
campaigns of several current 
Senators who are also part of 
ROTC.
The referendum gives the en
tire campus the opportunity to 
take a stand either for or against 
the resolution or to officially ab
stain by voting in todays refer
endum.
While the results of the vote 
are not binding on Senates final 
decision concerning the resolu
tion, a large turnout will defi
nitely make Senate  and the 
University administration  sit 
up and take serious notice. The 
more ballots cast, the greater the 
likelihood that the results of the 
vote will have some effect.
The problem is that Carnegie 
Mellon has a miserable track 
record when it comes to campuswide voting. With only 8.4 per
cent of the student body turning 
out for Senate elections last se
mester, it is difficult to expect a 
better turnout for this referen
dum.
Even though the issue is the 
topic of much controversy among
a great many members of the 
campus community, people seem 
unwilling to take a few minutes 
to show an ID and mark a ballot. 
This apathy is apalling.
There is no excuse for not vot
ing. If you are not sure what the 
resolution says, readitandmake 
an informed decision. There will 
be copies of the full text of the 
resolution available at the poll
ing place, as well as in Senates 
ad in this issue of The Tartan.
If youre not sure how you feel 
about the resolution, cant de
cide which side of the issue you 
support, or just dont care, there 
is an option to abstain right on 
the ballot. Voting in order to ab
stain may seem pointless, but 
ballots marked abstaining will 
count toward the final percent
age of voter turnout. All votes 
cast, whether for, against, or ab
staining, will have a definite 
impact on the fate of the resolu
tion.
But if no one votes, the referen
dum will be meaningless. This is 
the opportunity to let your opin
ion actually count for something. 
So many people are willing to 
pay lip service to this issue  it 
is perfectly reasonable to expect 
that all of those people will be 
quick to make their opinions 
known on the ballot, where it 
will actually countfor something.
Take a minute and stop by the 
Fence  or Baker Hall if the 
weather is bad  and vote. This 
is yet another chance for you to 
let Senate know what you think, 
as well as an excellent opportu
nity to participate in the work
ings of your community.
Not voting implies lack of in
terest, or worse, lack of an intel
ligent, informed opinion. At a 
university that is supposedly 
grooming the leaders of tomor
row, there is no excuse for either.Senate must strive to maintain ethics
Student Senate, as dictated by 
its constitution, distributes the 
Activities Fee among the vari
ous student organizations. It fol
lows that much of Senates busi
ness involves dealing with stu
dent organizations and making 
decisions about how to treat them 
equally and fairly.
Senators tend to be involved 
students, so most belong to at 
least one organization other than 
Senate. This raises ethical ques
tions about conflicts of interest.
Were not advocating forcing 
Senators to drop all activities 
other than Senate, or even rec
ommending that they do so. How
ever, we do want to make sure 
they are well aware of the ethics 
involved, and act accordingly.
Student Senate meetings arent 
generally well attended by mem
bers of the campus community. 
Those who do attend are some
times treated to advocacy 
speeches by Senators about other 
organizations of which they are 
members. Sometimes the Sena
tors even vote on those issues.
Ethically, this is wrong, be
cause the Senators have a strong 
conflict of interest in this type of 
situation. Roberts Rules of Or
der, which Senate follows, says 
that Senators should not vote on

in which they are involved, but 
does not mandate that they can
not.
This makes sense, because if 
Senators werent allowed to vote 
regarding their organizations, 
they would be unable to vote on 
Senates budget, as they must.
Since Senators are not required 
to abstain in votes involving con
flicts ofinterest, we remind them, 
especially now, at spring budget 
hearing time, to be responsible 
and abstain on votes involving 
their extra-Senate organizations.
Furthermore, in order to give 
all organizations fair represen
tation, we urge Senators not to 
even participate in discussions 
regarding clubs to which they 
belong. Its not fair to organiza
tions which have no members in 
common with Senate. This point 
applies to members at large as 
well, who have the opportunity 
to speak, though not to vote.
This is not to imply that all 
Senators speak for and vote on 
organizations in which they are 
involved. It does happen, how
ever, and we not only expect all 
Senators to stay out of those dis
cussions and abstain from those 
votes, but to make sure their 
colleagues with multi-organiza
tional ties abide by these ethical 
standards as well.

It has come to my 
attention that certainmembers of the 
campus community 
were offended by 
the political cartoon dealing with the 
Mike Tyson rape trial that I submit
ted for publication in last weeks Tar
tan. The controversy centers around 
the issue of two black men versus one 
white woman. Some people thought 
that my depiction of two black men 
looking at a white woman was an 
attempt to perpetuate the myth that 
black men always chase after white 
women. The individuals angered by 
my cartoon appear to have associated 
this characterization! with racism.
This is not the reaction I had either 
intended or anticipated. I never gave 
any thought to the issue until after 
the cartoon received the feedback it 
got. I can certainly understand why 
the cartoon offended so many people. 
Had I realized beforehand that it 
would have upset so many people, I 
would not have presented it in the 
manner in which it appeared in The 
Tartan.
I was merely attempting to create 
something for people to laugh at, and 
did not wish to offend anyone. I regret 
that anyone would mistake my at
tempt at political satire with racial 
degradation. This was in no way in
tended or foreseen as a possible inter
pretation. The cartoon was meant to 
be humorous; it was not intended as a 
racial statement, and was certainly 
not intended to contain racial over
tones. It was not my purpose to create 
racial innuendos. It was merely an 
attempt at humor; and I regret that 
anyone would draw such a conclusion 
from the cartoon. I regret that my 
cartoon was misconstrued, or that it 
offended anyone; this was not my in
tent.

Political cartoon offends 
concerned student
onLcitrr to iKc Editor

Editor:
The cartoon con
cerning Justice 
Clarence Thomas 
and Mike Tyson 
that appeared in 
The Tartan last week revealed more 
about the mind of the cartoonist who 
drew it thah it did about the issues 
the cartoon was apparently designed 
to address.
The cartoon, which appeared oppo
site the editorial page, pictured Jus
tice Thomas and Mike Tyson side-byside as they lustfully eye a young 
white woman who is walking past.
In the past six months there have 
been four cases of alleged sexual im
propriety that have captured the at
tention of the mass media. These 
cases include the allegations by Anita 
Hill that Clarence Thomas had sexu
ally harassed her while they were 
both working together at the Depart
ment of Education and at EEOC; the 
allegationby a woman in Florida that 
she had been raped by William Smith 
at the Kennedy residence in Palm 
Beach; the allegation by a former 
beauty contestant for Miss Black 
America that she had been raped by 
ex-boxing champion Mike Tyson; and 
the allegation offormer Miss America 
beauty contestant and Arkansas state 
employee Gennifer Flowers, that she 
had been sexually involved with Ar
kansas governor Bill Clinton and had 
obtained employment in the state 
government through him.
Notably it was not the two cases 
involving allegations of rape, one involving a white man and a white 
woman and the other involving a black 
man and a black woman. Strangely, 
the cases which involved the white 
males seem to have vanished into the 
air as far as the cartoonist was con
cerned and the only cases of sexual 
impropriety worth commenting on 
appear to have been the dissimilar 
cases involving African American 
males. These two cases were dissimi
lar in every respect, except for the 
fact that both of the men involved in 
the cases were black.
One would think that the selective 
interests and the selective memory of 
the cartoonist would have been bad 
enough, but readers will find even 
more images of interest when they 
observe how the cartoonist has cho
sen to depict the victim in his car
toon. While the allegations of sexual 
impropriety in both cases, as noted 
above, involved African American 
men and women, in the cartoonists 
mind, lo and behold, the victim is 
miraculously transformed from a 
woman who is black into a white 
woman.
Now, the obvious response that will 
come from those who do not want to 
deal with the issues that were raised 
in this cartoon and the ways in which 
those issues were distorted will be 
that it was only a cartoon, and that 
people should not be so sensitive about 
it. But the issues that the cartoon 
attempts to address are very serious 
issues, and how those issues were 
distorted by the cartoonist should tell 
us all a great deal about how they 
may also be distorted in the minds of 
a number of'otherwise intelligent 
people.
Above all, we must ask ourselves 
which fears and stereotypes concern
ing African American males some 
people seem to find all-too-easy to 
embrace and why it is necessary to 
transform the alleged victim from a 
white female in order to add to the 
impact of the offense.

Alumnus fears lack of con
cern by soccer coach
Editor:
I am writing to The 
Tartan to express my 
concerns about Nick 
Gaudioso, the head 
coach of the Mens 
Varsity Soccer program, and more spe 
cifically, his actions towards members 
of the University community. When I 
was an undergraduate student, I was a 
member of the varsity soccer team for 
two seasons (I lettered both seasons).
Since then, I have graduated, and I 
am now a second-year student at the 
Graduate School of Industrial Admin
istration (GSIA). I am greatly offended 
by Mr. Gaudiosos treatment of both; 
past and present players as well as 
members of both the alumni and un:, 
dergraduate communities. Given Mr,, 
Gaudioso is a representative of the 
University as a whole, I believe his 
actions are a concern to all members of 
the Universtiy community.
This past weekend, CMU held its 
annual indoor soccer tournament. I wag, 
invited to play on the alumni team ( 
am an alumnus in the truest sense) in, 
the tournament by several current 
members of the team.
Since I play with a number of the 
current players on a team of my own in 
a recreational league, and because I 
live in a house with seven of the play
ers, I was looking forward to participat
ing in a Carnegie Mellon activity with 
(against) them.
However, when I arrived at the gym' 
on Saturday morning to play, I was told' 
by Mr. Gaudioso, Youre not an 
alumni, to which I replied that I was 
both an alumnus and a former player 
under his tenure.
Mr. Gaudioso responded, You dont 
have the skills to play in this tourna
ment. I made no further reply at that 
point.
I am not writing to defend or concur 
with Mr. Gaudiosos assessment of my 
abilities. Rather, I write because, as an 
alumnus, I am offended that I was 
deprived of the opportunity to partici: 
pate in an event I was fully qualified 
for. Furthermore, I am even more infu: 
riated that a University official would 
verbally insult me.
I have not had a conversation with 
Mr. Gaudioso in almost two and onehalf years. That he would take this tone 
with someone after not speaking with 
him for such a period is indicative of 
Mr. Gaudiosos treatment of his past 
and present players.
I make the above assertion because 
he has demonstrated this type of be
havior in the past. During my under
graduate years, the University teani 
has never had more than three seniors 
play on the team for all four years that 
they were eligible.
For instance, my freshmen year, there 
were twelve freshmen on the team. By 
my sophomore year, only five (includ
ing myself) remained.
By my junior year, only one of the 
original twelve was still a member oif 
the team. Moreover, the three years 
preceding my own class graduation 
(1988,1989,1990) have met with simi
lar attrition rates.
Only nine players in the past four

Rape coverage needs more fairness
Chris Restifo
Despite his money, despite his 
fame, despite his ability as one 
of the greatest boxers in the 
world, Mike Tyson got caught. 
After only nine hours of delib
eration, the jury returned a ver
dict of guilty on one count of 
rape and two counts of criminal 
deviance. For once, it may seem, 
justice was done, and a rapist 
got what he deserved. But what 
about the overall picture?
The victim, Desiree Washing
ton, decided last week to go pub
lic with her story. Her picture 
will appear in People, and there 
are plans for her to appear in a 
Barbara Walters interview on 
ABCs 20120.
Of course, until she made that 
decision, her identity as Mike 
Tysons accuser remained hid
den, unlike Mike Tysons iden
tity as the suspected rapist. And 
as before with the William 
Kennedy Smith trial, people are
questioningthejudgement and morality of 
the medias decision to 
not report the names 
of suspected rape vic
tims.
Writing or even 
speaking about this 
subject opens up a re
ally, really ugly can of 
worms. Whenever one 
reads any form of ar
gument, one must do 
his or her best to re
main calm, clear
headed, and openminded as to others 
viewpoints. Obvious
ly, arguments that all 
men are rapists and 
their victims should 
have absolute privacy 
at all costs and that 
no men rape and 
people should know 
everything about the accuser are 
both far-fetched. The gray areas 
in between, however, offer good 
points on both sides.
My concern here is not the 
legal system. Information from 
a trial (unless the case is sealed 
for some reason) is openly avail
able to the public. What dis
tresses me is the fact that the 
media, now able to bring cam
eras and other equipment into 
the courtroom, is acting in a 
very hypocritical manner and 
ignoring an issue that needs to 
be resolved now.
It seems as though its per
fectly acceptable and even prac
tical to plaster the suspected 
rapists name all over the place 
while shrouding the suspected 
victims name in mystery. Re
porters and so-called legal ex
perts delve deep into the private lives of both par
ties, exposing their sex 
lives, relationships, 
short-comings, and psy
chological profiles, and 
comment on their im
pact on the case. While 
we hear Mike Tyson 
and William Kennedy 
Smith, we never hear 
Desiree Washington 
and Patricia Bowman. 
Those who defend 
keeping the alleged 
victims name secret 
speak of the social 
stigma of rape. Other 
women, they claim, see 
how badly and inhu
manely the accuser is 
treated on the stand. 
While watching the 
trial, they notice how 
every little detail of the 
accusers sex life and 
prior encounters are held up in 
order to destroy her credibility. 
Such an environment, coupled 
with the release of the accusers 
name, only forces rape victims 
to remain silent. Fearful of pub
lic scorn and scrutiny, they avoid

Carnegie Mellon is a school split by the 
heterogeneity of its students. Each indi
vidual college usually contains a fairly 
homogeneous pool of students, but across 
the different colleges, the people are dif
ferent, holding opposing beliefs and ide
als. And there are other splits when look
ing at the organizations on campus. These 
are the splits that seem to be the breed
ing grounds for problems.
ROTC and cmuOUT are two organiza
tions on campus that have students as 
members. However, the nature of the 
ROTC program, as handed down by the 
Department of Defense (DoD), eliminates 
the prospect of full participation between 
members of these two groups. The DoD 
policy is against giving gays, lesbians, 
and bisexuals ROTC scholarships. There 
are a number of rationalizations the DoD
uses to support their discrimination, but 
Im not going to get into analyzing them.
How this policy affects our campus, 
though, has become very important over 
the past semester. As a recap, Student 
Senate passed a resolution last Novem
ber calling for the elimination of ROTC 
from CMU if the DoD policy on gays does
overturn the November resolution and 
this semester it was given to Student 
Senate. In response and according to 
Senate law, a vote is going before the 
campus to gauge the support of the stu
dent body for the November resolution.
The November resolution is projected 
to be overturned, as it should be. StuFirst, ROTC funding is separate from 
the University, so the University is not 
in violation of anything. It accepts stu
dents without bias and gives financial 
aid without bias. In addition, to believe 
that the DoD will change its policies 
simply because a Student Senate in Pitts
burgh said it should is egotistical and

not change, because it states that the

of non-discrimination. ROTC then staged 
a successful write-in vote campaign and 
effectively stacked the Senate with a num

graduating years have played through 
their senior seasons. I consider this an 
alarming trend.
Mr. Gaudiosos inability to field a com
plete alumni team for this tournament 
points to his failure to retain his players. 
The five alumni that played were com
bined with a group of players from Mary 
Washington College. That Mr. Gaudioso 
allowed a personal grudge to interfere 
with an alumnus desire to participate in 
a Carnegie Mellon event sends a discour
aging signal.
I have been an ardent supporter of the 
Carnegie Mellon soccer team since the 
day I arrived. This experience has tainted 
my perception of the quality of treatment 
an alumnus can expect.

Multiculturalism offers a 
welcome diversity
Editor:
Last weeks Tartan 
column by R.D. Quinn 
[Cultures clash in re
defining America, 2/
10] was a speciously aron
3FmmFt mc 
m7F C'Dmct
gued, reactionary diatribe on the move
ment towards social diversity and 
multiculturalism in the U.S. At best Mr. 
Quinns column simply reinscribes the 
deeply-imbedded nationalist ideology a 
multiculturally-literate education would 
challenge.
Mr. Quinns column belies an unques
tioned investment in the dominant nar
ratives of U.S. history.
Consequently, he begins by assuming 
nationality as the primary measure of 
cultural value, arguing that identifica
tion with the larger national culture and 
history is more important (a claim he 
supports through tautological appeals to 
the very myths of American history which 
gave rise to his brand of nationalism in
the first place).
In his terms, America is a melting pot 
 a metaphor implying that all individu
als and groups are heterogeneously dis
persed within a society constituted by 
conditions of equivalent material well
being and equal access to avenues of 
power.
Within this paranoic logic, multi
culturalism amounts to the tyrany of 
those groups who manage to have its 
culture promoted... to put down another 
culture  an ironic remark, to say the 
least, to anyone who does not see U.S. 
history from the obvious point of view of 
ruling class interests.
Not surprising, Mr. Quinn never ex
plains who is melting into what, since 
his image of America needs to elide the 
long history of struggles against domi
nant social classes (the pot into which 
everything melts).
Rather, he argues that in America, we 
have never had constant warring frac
tions. Of course, anyone the least bit 
knowledgeable about multiculturalist 
histories would know that the entire his
tory of the U.S. is replete with on-going 
internal conflict  as hundreds of histo
ries by and about women, African Ameri
cans, European immigrants, workers, 
political organizations, and various eth
nic and religious constituencies will at
test.
Mr. Quinns ostensible ignorance of 
those histories and the intra-class 
struggles they detail is perhaps the great
est testament to the needs for some form 
of multicultural education.
Only those who can afford themselves 
the luxury of ignoring a historical record 
inconsistent with a disposition necessary 
to the assurances of positions of relative 
comfort are inclined to remain compla
cent with Mr. Quinns version of multi
culturalism and the image of American 
history his account invariably serves.

their embarrassment, that the group 
was a pro-Nazi organization, and the 
quickly left.
They did so because they did not sup
port one fundamental aspect of the be
liefs for which the group stood. This, 
despite the fact that they had enjoyed 
the social activities and ethnic enrich
ment. It is impossible to belong to a 
group that discriminates without your 
very membership tacitly supporting that 
discrimination. While it is difficult to 
affect change in an organization so large 
as the U.S. Armed Services, it is possible 
to change CMUs ROTC involvement. 
This should be done in the hopes of 
drawing attention and causing change 
to a policy many feel is wrong: exclusion 
of gays and lesbians from the armed 
services.
While ROTC may not be the root of the 
problem, excluding it from CMUs pro
fessed non-discriminatory campus until 
problems have been corrected may shake 
the tree a little.

Furthermore, I found the protest by 
H&SS students who planned to skip 
classes on January 20 to be an empty 
gesture, reducing Kings legacy to an 
excuse for a day off  [we] assumed

protestor Josh Knauer. A universitys 
academic calendar is usually fixed years 
in advance  if the King holiday (or a

these students they should have investi
gated the issue before enrolling. One 
hopes that our institutions will be sensi
tive to our concerns, but the idea that one 
is owed a certain day off is without basis 
in the real world.
Of course, a student is always free to 
skip a class and face whatever conse

however, if a professor were to cancel a 
class, and I suggest that each affected 
student take his or her tuition bill, divide 
it by the number of classes he or she will 
have this semester, and find out how 
much their instructors celebration cost

further that legacy.

Falling national standards require 
attention to math and science
T'r*
John Funge
I find it disappointing to con
sider the number of American 
college graduates who have 
never taken a calculus class. 
Whether it is my mother, who is 
a registered nurse, or my sister, 
who is a law student, I am dis
turbed that they, like many 
other professionals, have never 
been introduced to the very ba
sil math of calculus. Yet, since 
Americans apparently have 
trouble mastering arithmetic 
and algebra, calculus seems to 
be the least of our worries.
Throughout the last couple 
weeks, both U.S.A. Today and 
Newsweek have published ar
ticles addressing the fact that 
American students lag behind 
our foreign competitors in terms 
of math and science. Though 
both these publications commu
nicate very well the results of 
sdme seemingly valid interna
tional exam, they fail to address 
reasons why we should be con
cerned that our students are 
measurably weak in math and 
sdence. Truly, why should we 
care that our students dont mea
sure up to many foreigners in 
terms of math and science?
Well, essentially, our foreign 
competitors show us how well 
math and science education can 
bo done. Thus, they provide us 
with an educational reference 
standard. However, this still 
doesnt tell us why we should be 
ccncemed with math and sci
ence in the first place. Lets be
realistic  how will the every
day Joe use higher math and 
science? (When I refer vaguely 
to higher math and science, I 
mean calculus-level mathemat
ics and a science background 
consisting of at least basic chem
istry, biology, and physics.)
One of the most compelling
tion. I truly believe that cultur
ally encouraged discipline is one 
of the principle components that 
differentiates the Japanese, who 
build Nintendos, from Ameri
cans, who play Nintendos.
The fact that the conscientious 
study of math and science may 
act as a beneficial disciplinary
I truly believe that culturally encour
aged discipline is one of the prin
ciple components that differentiates 
the Japanese, who build Nintendos, 
from Americans, who play Nintendos.
and obvious reasons I see for 
American students to be pushed 
harder in math and science is 
that we are living in a progres
sively more technological soci
ety. In fact, developments such 
as computerized art media are 
making subjects that are tradi
tionally mathand science-free 
more technology oriented. In 
general, we need more people 
that can improve upon, as well 
as creatively utilize the many 
technological masterpieces that 
are currently available.
Yet beyond technological mo
tivations, math and science still 
represent critical components of 
the complete education. In gen
eral, it requires a significant 
effort to master these subjects. 
Consequently, enhanced disci
pline is one indirect benefit that 
is reaped from the effort put 
into math and science. And, like 
it or not, good self-discipline is 
one of the greatest skills that 
can be gleaned from an educaexercise or provide students with 
a solid foundation upon which 
to build technological knowledge 
is obvious.
Math and science require 
much more conceptual and syn
thetic reasoning than other factually-based disciplines. Of 
course, this is not to say that it 
doesnt require critical thinking 
to analyze a poem or interpret a 
philosophy, but still, math
ematical and scientific reason
ing remain different. In general, 
math and science are less intui
tive and require more effort to 
grasp and appreciate their 
beauty.
Beauty? Yes, beauty. Math 
and science, when thoroughly 
understood, are nothing short 
of beautiful. Euclids proof of 
the infinitude of prime numbers 
is every bit as glorious as a 
Shakespearean sonnet. In fact, 
hard core math or science, for 
its own sake, can be as much of 
a humanity as any kind of his
tory or English. This is some
thing that most people dont rec
ognize. Furthermore, many of 
the traditional humanities can 
be greatly enhanced with a 
strong math/science back
ground.
For instance, the study of the 
effects of technologies on his
tory is a reasonably fresh field. 
A strong math/science back
ground certainly can give the 
technological historian better 
insights. Another example of 
this can be seen in the fact that 
the magnitude and feasibility of 
a philosophy such as Laplacean 
Determinism truly cant be 
grasped without a knowledge of 
differential equations.
Okay, Okay. Differential 
equations  schmifferential 
equations  whatever. Let me 
step down from my soap box. 
Realistically, I understand that 
within our country, there are 
demographic and cultural bar
riers that inhibit the progress of 
education in general, no less the 
teaching of higher math and 
science. As a result, its unlikely 
that were going to see calculus 
being made into a high school 
graduation requirement as it 
should be. However, this must 
not stop us from taking a look at 
math and science in a new light, 
and perhaps trying to improve 
the negative image that over
shadows these disciplines. When 
presented well, math and sci
ence can be quite useful.

contend that a five-time Jeop

cated if he or she has not taken

Senate resolution resolves nothing

array of classes open to all 
students, ROTC or not, het
erosexual or homosexual.
Through this political state
ment, Senate would simply rid 
the campus of all the benefits 
ROTC brings to it. In return, 
they would accomplish noth
ing. The DoD wouldnot change 
its policy. Those qualified stu
dents will go to MIT, Colum
bia, or Princeton. And the cam
pus will suffer.
I said that Carnegie Mellon 
is split by its heterogeneity. 
But the experiences that stu
dents obtain from this are in
valuable. True, there are a lot 
of conflicts. But there are also 
many people coming to under
stand each other. Anywhere 
other than a campus as small 
and as diverse as CMU, this 
would not happen.
But Student Senate has 
opened a Pandoras box. It has 
made a political statement that 
usually is only s:een on the 
lawns of the White House, at 
the Pentagon, or on the steps 
of the Capitol between lobby
ists and members of Congress. 
The problem is that here, at 
CMU, there is no real solution 
to the questions Student Sen
ate has raised. Senates solu
tion was ridding itself of the 
problem by pushing it, away, 
not actually trying to solve it.
Shortly, the vote to overturn 
the November resolution will 
come and go. In all likelihood, 
the resolution will be over
turned. But now that the ques
tion has been so blatantly 
stated, it will linger.
But where can we go from
here? What is going to hap
pen? Most likely, the question 
of discrimination will move 
away from the limelight and 
fester in everyones mind while 
they try to avoid it. There will 
be a growing attitude towards 
ROTC that it is somehow in
volved with creating a policy 
of discrimination against gays 
and lesbians.
Yes, I am being rather dis
mal about the whole situation. 
It can be different, however. 
The reasons most of these con
flicts seem to occur on campus 
is that while many students 
learn from the experiences of 
working with people different 
from themselves, most are con
tent to stay within their own 
world. The problem is that 
most of the students who seem 
to be involved with these con
flicts hold radically different 
ideals and are unwilling to un
derstand the other side.
No, we cant do anything to 
change the DoD policy. That 
fight is futile. But we can pro
mote growth and understand
ing here on campus.
Change doesnt come as fast 
as a Senate resolution can be 
passed, as demonstrated by 
what happened last Novem
ber. That seems to lead to a lot 
of angry people and a stacked 
Senate. If Senate wants to 
make an impact and help the 
students at the same time, it 
should promote some under
standing and mixing of ideas, 
instead of promoting the build
ing of walls and chasms.

CMU, ROTC, and 
discrimination...
On November 5, 1991, Student Senate passed the following resolution:
Resolution Against Discrimination by ROTC at Carnegie Mellon
Whereas, Carnegie Mellon Universitys Statement of Assurance states Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in ad
mission, employment, or administration of its programs on the basis of... sexual orientation; and
Whereas, ROTC, including Army ROTC, NROTC, and AFROTC, is directed by Department of Defense policy which prohibits 
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from service; and
Whereas, the Admissions Office of Carnegie Mellon confers with ROTC officers concerning prospective students during the appli
cation process; and
Whereas, ROTC provides financial assistance to heterosexual students only; and
Whereas, ROTC often requires the repayment of financial assistance in the case that a member is revealed to be gay, lesbian, or
bisexual; and
Whereas, it is hypocritical of the University to allow ROTC to discriminate; and
Whereas, a Carnegie Mellon student has been forced to disenroll from ROTC due to his sexual orientation and this is clearly a 
violation of University policy; and
Whereas, other universities have decided to terminate or to not reinstate/renew ROTC contracts until such time ROTC ceases to 
discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation;
Therefore be it resolved that the Student Senate, in representation of the student body of Carnegie Mellon University, gives full 
support for the Statement of Assurance of the University; and
Be it further resolved that the Senate condemns the hypocrisy of the University in allowing and condoning discrimination through 
ROTC; and
Be it further resolved that the Senate calls upon the University to state in all publications that the University allows ROTC to 
remain In direct violation of its Statement of Assurance by actively discriminating in admission and application of its programs; 
and
Be it further resolved that the Senate directs the University to replace, in its entirety, the ROTC financial support of students who 
are or have been forced to quit ROTC due to their sexual orientation; and
Be it further resolved that the Senate shall prohibit ROTC or ROTC-sponsored organizations to participate in events funded or 
partially funded by the Student Activities Fee; and
Be it further resolved that the Senate directs the University administration to take immediate and vigorous action to comply with 
its own Statement of Assurance, including the following steps:
 Prohibit the use of University facilities, finances, and resources by ROTC and ROTC-related organizations.
 Do not agree to any new or extend prior contracts with programs of the Department of Defense or its branches or any 
other organization which requires Carnegie Mellon to discriminate on the basis or sexual orientation.
 Actively join with with other universities and fight against discrimination in the military and other government 
organizations.
Be it finally resolved that if discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by ROTC is not ended, the University is directed to 
terminate any and all contracts with ROTC programs by the end of the 1995-1996 academic year until those programs no longer 
discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Today there will be a campus referendum on this resolution. 
Tell Student Senate what your opinion is by casting your vote. 
Polls open 10 am-6 pm, in front of the fence, weather permitting,

Media treatment of accused rapists considered unfair

coming forward to speak out 
about the truth.
Others, however, say that if 
women did come forward and 
speak out, then the stigma would 
be removed. Both men and 
women would begin to realize 
that rape does exist and that it 
does a horrendous amount of 
damage. Instead of avoiding it 
or treating it as something dif
ferent, people would deal with 
it as they should: a violent crime 
that should be prosecuted just 
like any other crime.
something to her identity, her 
status, if you will. It paints her 
as the victim, something which 
has yet to be proven. Regardless 
of the outcome of the trial, the 
mans reputation can be com
pletely ruined. On the other 
hand, the woman has the choice 
to come forward ... a choice the 
man did not have.
Now, if the media decided to 
completely reveal everything 
about both parties, names and 
all, it could do serious damage 
not only to the peoples reputa
tions, but to the chances for a
Not printing or otherwise making 
public the woman's name does 
something to her identity, her sta
tus, if you will. It paints her as the 
victim,  something which has yet 
to be proven.
The media, instead of helping 
to advanqb either side, is cur
rently up in the air, incapable of 
developing an ethical set of stan
dards to deal with these situa
tions. Soiind rather contradic
tory? AlloW me to explain.
Under the current system of 
typical reporting, you, the aver
age persoh on the street, gets 
the down and dirty about every
thing that ^happened the night of 
the supposed crime. You also get 
the background on both parties, 
including things like how many 
times oneof them masturbates 
each week.;You get the name of 
the accused man. You dont get 
the name of the woman.
Sound a'little unfair? Not 
printing or otherwise making
 public the womans name does
fair trial. Remember how seques
tered the jury was during the 
Smith trial? Notice again how it 
all rests on the mans name. The 
trial is referred to by Smith 
not Smith-Bowman or Bow
man.
On the other hand, if the news 
media decided to release noth
ing, it would be going against its 
very principles and purpose for 
existencereporting the news. 
Since the information is public, 
you have the right to know. The 
media can go a long way toward 
changing social attitudes and 
educating people by reporting 
on whats happening in the legal 
system.
It should be obvious by now 
that Im aiming at a balance. Go 
ahead and release the names of
both the accuser and the sus
pected rapist. Go ahead and dis
cuss what both sides claimed 
happened the night of the sus
pected rape. Go ahead and re
port on whether or not both par
ties were drinking, fooling 
around, etc. As graphic as that 
may sound, the information is 
needed in a rape trial.
Dont, however, go into the 
deep personal lives of both par
ties. Dont tell everyone that the 
woman had an abortion in col
lege after a sexual relationship 
with someone who beat her. 
Dont mention the fact that the 
man had a reputation as a per
son who nailed women. Con
centrate only on the details per
tinent to the case.
Of course, what constitutes 
pertinent is subject to the 
courts interpretation. Report
ing on the nitty-gritty details of 
how many times the man ejacu
lated or showing a pair of blood
stained womens underwear on 
national TV is nothing more than 
sensationalism. Its also highly 
questionable when it comes to 
journalistic integrity.
Revealing the names of both 
parties and responsibly report
ing the details of the case en
sures that a fair-as-possible ap
proach is taken. Additionally, it 
helps to chip away at the stigma 
of rape.
I think defense attorneys at
tempts to discredit the accuser 
by exposing everything about her 
life are deplorable, but the me
dia should at least do better for 
both parties. And it should do 
better fairly.

It has become fashionable to 
bash the Japanese for their 
unfairtradingpractices caus
ing our economic woes, but in 
fact it is entirely our own fault. 
Theres an old saying: people 
cant walk onyou unless you lie 
down first. This is exactly the 
case in the current trade im
balance with Japan  to be 
precise: American industry 
coupled with the government 
are directly responsible. Some 
of the primary causes are:
 A lack of viewing every cus
tomer as vital. Make it cheap
 who cares if the little guy 
feels ripped off? Although its 
been shown that people will 
pay a premium for quality 
products and services, Ameri
can industry is only now real
izing that success relies on 
meeting the customers needs 
and wants. We wouldnt buy 
cars with right-hand steering 
wheelswhy should the Japa
nese buy our left-handed cars?
 A lack of long-term vision in 
industry. VCRs andflat-screen 
displays were both inventions 
that companies here didntfeel 
would be worth the investment 
to produce  and now the 
Japanese are beating us with 
them. Because U.S. industry 
is short term profit oriented 
motivated by Wall Streets ob
session with the fast buck  
they generally wont invest in 
multi-year development, while 
the Japanese will and do.
Andwestillhaventlearned!
For example, Virtual Reality has 
tremendous potential in many 
industries. Aside from a few vi
sionaries, the U.S. firms that 
should be developing Virtual 
Reality arent, while the Japa
nese have committed themselves 
to a highly aggressive develop
ment program.
 A lack of will on the part of our 
government. If the Japanese 
have unfair trading practices 
(and they do in many areas), 
then our government should
with campaign contributions.
 Our anti-trust laws which 
prohibit intra-industry and 
government-industry coop
eration. In Japan (and Eu
rope), government subsidies 
and industrial cooperation are 
; commonplace.

petitor to our domestic air

markets for everything, or you 
cant sell your goods here. Pe
riod. Free trade is the best trade, 
but only if it is truly free in both 
directions  that applies to au
tos and rice equally.
 A treasonous corruption in our 
lobbying system. The Japanese 
(among others) spend millions 
of dollars a year to influence 
legislation. Many lobbyists are 
ex-government officials whouse 
their contacts to advance the 
interests of a foreign nation. An 
example: minivans from Japan 
arrive and are classified as 
trucks so as to avoid various 
import duties and safety restric
tions. Once unloaded into dealer 
lots, they are reclassified as cars.
How are they getting away 
with this? Ask the lobbyists who 
actively sell out their countrys 
future for a huge paycheck, and 
members of Congress they bribe
consortium was shut down by 
the Justice Department be
cause of anti-trust laws.
We blithely accept it as for
eign nations take advantage 
of the weaknesses in our sys
tem.
We must tell our elected 
leaders to put their collective 
feet down about trade barri
ers, about lobbyists, about 
loosening the anti-trust laws 
to allow more cooperation 
(short of monopolies), and 
about making it to industrys 
financial advantage to take 
the long view, and to keep 
manufacturingjobs domestic.
We must take action now, 
before we join the Roman 
Empire in the history book of

This weekends road trip to 
Boston and Rochester left me 
with a bad taste in my mouth.
It wasnt the fact that the 
mens team lost their games, 
the shoulder-height 
showerhead in the Rochester 
Holiday Inn, or the fact that 
USAir double-booked my seat 
on the flight home, though 
those all upset me too. The 
thing that soured my weekend 
most was seeing two more 
athletic facilities that are 
better than ours.
Griping about the athletic 
facilities on this campus, in 
and of itself, isnt anything 
new. Hey, the Athletic Facili
ties Improvement Committee 
(of which I am one of the 
student reps) was built on a 
foundation of student disgruntlement. Its just that, on 
this particular trip, I had a lot 
of time to wander these places 
and see just what were 
missing out on.
Granted, Brandeis facility 
was built with help from 
Boston Celtics.money (hence 
the name Red Auerbach 
Arena for the basketball 
court), but the place was 
amazing. Snack bar, racquetball/squash courts in droves 
sorry, I dont know the exact 
differences), a room full of 
bikes and StairMasters in 
addition to the full weight 
room, even an indoor track 
and indoor tennis courts.
Frankly, Im a little bit 
jealous. I realize there are 
major logistic problems with 
overhauling the existing 
facilities  as a member of 
AFIC, Im finding out more 
than I probably want to about 
these problems  but the 
biggest change has nothing to 
do with space, money, or 
anything tangible.
Its attitude. I get the feeling 
that most people see athletic 
facility improvement as, 
metaphorically speaking, 
putting out the good silver
ware for the neighbors. Lost in 
the shuffle is that its an issue 
of quality of campus life, not 
just catering to the whims of 
the varsity sports teams.
Well, let me qualify that a 
little. Some people do under
stand the importance of the 
issue. Athletic Director John 
Harvey and the Athletic 
Department are very aware of 
the problems and are trying to 
fix things. Unfortunately, they 
have to run up against those 
concrete problems I mentioned 
 lack of funding, the inher
ent limits of the existing 
facilities, and the dubious 
theory that the University 
Center will singlehandedly fix 
these problems (thats if it ever 
gets built).
The people that need to 
wake up are the ones control
ling the purse strings. They 
have to be made aware that 
this goes beyond getting a 
couple of good varsity basket
ball players or having some
thing flashy to point at and 
say, Isnt that nice! Its about 
the fact that CMU is a sup
posed to be a world-class 
university and recreation 
should be part of that.

Boston, MA  Coming into 
Fridays game against Brandeis 
University on the heels of a twogame losing streak, the CMU 
womens basketball team des
perately needed a win to remain 
in the University Athletic Asso
ciation (UAA) title picture.
And a win is exactly what they 
got, though it was scary down 
the stretch. After leading by as 
much as 18 points, the Tartans 
survived a late Brandeis rush to 
win, 57-54. The win, combined 
with New York Universitys 67- 
65 overtime victory over Wash
ington University yesterday, 
moved the Tartans back into the 
conference lead.
It was an important game, 
but we had a really good prac
tice the day before the game, 
said head coach Gerri Seidl. I 
felt the team was up and was 
executing well, and that made 
me feel real positive.
On the surface, Seidls opti
mism would seem surprising, 
since the Tartans also went into 
Fridays game without sophoSPORTS_____________

from an infec______________
tion in her left 
foot, will likely
be sidelined until the last week
end of the season, though there 
is a very slim possibility she will 
play in the Tartans home finale 
against Emory University.
Although the Tartans had a 
much better shooting perfor
mance than Brandeis (.481 to 
.282) and out-rebounded the 
Judges, 51-39, the Judges made
[Gretz] really 
pulled us through. 
We were looking 
for a guard to step 
up and she went 
out there and 
played with a lot 
of heart.
 Gerri Seidl
up for it by taking 19 more shots 
and going to the free throw line 
25 times.
The first half of the game was
____________ remarkably
even. Both 
teams were able 
to put together 
a few small 
runs, but the 
largest gap of 
the half was only 
a six-point Tar
tan lead with 
5:12 remaining. 
However, a fivepoint Brandeis 
run dissolved 
that lead, and 
after a few more
_____________ baskets, Camegie Mellon 
went to the half 
with a 30-27 lead.
It took a few minutes for the 
Tartan offense to get into gear in 
the second half, but at the 17:22 
mark, the dam burst. The next 
five minutes were all Carnegie 
Mellon, as the Tartans put 16 
unanswered points on the board. 
When Brandeis finally put the 
ball in the hoop again, the score
was 4629.
That score, a free throw by 
Brandeis forward Stacey Nelson, 
turned out to be the start of a 
Brandeis comeback. For a few 
minutes, the slowdown in the 
CMU offense wasnt a problem 
because Brandeis wasnt getting 
anywhere either.
That was to change after the 
10-minute mark, when Brandeis 
rattled off 10 unanswered points 
to make the score 50-43 with 
five minutes to play.
We had a breakdown in our 
halfcourt man-to-man defense, 
said Seidl. We were givingthem 
the baseline a lot, and they were 
taking advantage of it.
A basket by sophomore for
ward Mary Moore ended the sixminute scoreless stretch, but the 
Judges scored seven more to pull 
to 52-50 with 1:47 left. Luckily 
for the Tartans, the last minute 
became the Jennifer Gretz show. 
Gretz, a freshman guard, scored 
the final five points for the Tar
tans, including a free-throw with 
two seconds remaining which 
pushed the margin back up to 
three, 57-54.
Gretz led the Tartans withl5
points, and senior for ward Amy 
Buxbaum scored 10. Senior 
guard Katie Fahey led the Tar
tans rebounding effort, pulling 
down nine.
The result of last Mondays 
contest against Grove City Col
lege was much less pleasant as 
the Tartans fell to the Wolver
ines, 67-59.
The game was tied 30-30 at 
the half, but the tide of the game 
swung with the shooting per
centages. Grove City went from 
.333 in the first half up to .452, 
while the Tartans sagged from 
.364 to .324. Converting 17 of 20 
free throws certainly didnt hurt 
the Wolverines cause.
Four of the seven Wolverines 
who saw action scored in double 
figures, led by Kathy Hairs 16 
points and 16 rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon was led by 
Buxbaum (20 points, 13 re
bounds) and Megahan (15 
points, 11 rebounds).
The Tartans, now 17-4 over
all (9-2 in the UAA), head home 
to play Emory University on Feb
ruary 23.
Tip-off for the home finale will 
be at 1 pm in the main gym.

Special to The Tartan
Carnegie Mellon hosted an indoor 
soccer tournament last Saturday. Par
ticipating teams included CMU, Pitt, 
Robert Morris, Grove City, Hiram, Al
legheny, Mount Union, and a team con
sisting of CMU and Mary Washington 
College alumni.
The purpose of the tournament is to 
give players an opportunity to practice 
and improve their skills in the off-season. During this nontraditional sea
son, CMU participates in six different 
tournaments, the next being the Grove 
CitySlippery Rock tournament, which 
will be held the first weekend in March.
In the first game, Carnegie Mellon 
fell to Pitt, 3-2. Both CMU goals were 
scored by senior Alan Horn.
Freshman Alex Amezquita scored the 
only goal in the second game. CMU lost 
to Robert Morris College, 2-1.
In the final match-up before the tour
nament playoffs, CMU lost to Grove 
City College, 1-0. In the playoffs, CMU 
faced the alumni team from CMU and 
Mary Washington. The Tartans were 
defeated in overtime, 2-1. The only 
CMU goal of the game was scored by 
freshman Vince Russell. The loss in
curred in this game eliminated the Tar
tans from any further play.
The alumni team advanced into the 
playoffs, but the final game was played 
between Pitt and Robert Morris, with 
Pitt winning the overall tournament.
Head coach Nick Gaudioso was 
pleased with his teams performance 
despite its losses.
Gaudioso sees this time as a transi
tional period and a chance to practice 
without the graduating seniors.
Senior Alan Horn, who will be eligible 
to play next fall, said, Considering this 
is the first time we played together 
indoors, I think we looked all right. Our 
only problem was scoring goals. Other
wise, we played well together, even 
though the results didnt show.
UAA rankings inadequate
By TRACY HAYES
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
CMUs standings in the Uni
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) championships do not 
reflect how we did at the UAAs, 
said head swimming coach Jim 
Catrone. CMU men placed 
fourth in the conference behind 
Johns Hopkins, Rochester, and 
NYU. The women placed sev
enth, beating only Brandeis.
Catrone claims that the teams 
would have placed better had 
they not lacked divers and depth. 
Despite the disappointing stand
ings, the team did exceptionally 
well. The men broke 12 
Carenegie Mellon records and 
four UAA records, and the 
women broke four Carnegie 
Mellon records.
In the first day of competi
tion, senior Brian Zimmerman 
won the 500-yard freestyle in 
4:32.31, breaking the school 
record and the UAArecord. This 
time was also 1.77 seconds faster 
than Zimmermans national 
championship time last year.
The mens 200-yard freestyle 
relay was swum by freshman 
Jason Burkey, sophomore Todd 
Vandall, junior Ted Beatty, and 
Zimmerman. With a time of 
1:25.89, they took second place, 
setting a new CMU record and 
qualifying for nationals.
Sophomore Denise Fenwick 
qualified for nationals in the 200- 
yard individual medley. She 
placed fourth with a time of 
2:13.55.
Zimmerman beat another of 
his national championship times 
when he won the 200-yard 
freestyle on the second day. His 
time of1:40.36 qualified him for 
nationals and broke CMU and 
UAA records.
Burkey also broke a school 
record in day two in the 100- 
yard backstroke. He placed sec
ond with a time of 53.73 and 
qualified for nationals.
In the 100-yard breaststroke, 
Fenwick broke the school record 
and qualified for nationals with 
her fourth place time of1:09.95.
Burkey, Vandall, junior Jamie 
Millar, and Zimmerman won the 
800-yard freestyle relay. With a 
time of 6:57.16, they qualified 
for nationals and set new CMU 
and UAA records. Burkey also 
qualified for the 200-yard 
freestyle with his split time, 
1:43.29.
In the last day of competition, 
Zimmerman won the 1650-yard 
freestyle in 16:17.52. Qualify
ing him for nationals, this time 
successfully defended his UAA 
championship from last year.
Vandall, Burkey, Beatty, and 
Zimmerman competed as ateam 
again, this time in the 800-yard
freestyle relay. Winning the race 
and qualifying for nationals with 
a time of3:08.69, they beat both 
CMU and UAA records.
Fenwick placed second and 
qualified for nationals in the 200- 
yard breaststroke with a time of 
2:28.28. Her time set a CMU 
record. Millar qualified for na
tionals in the mens 200-yard 
breaststroke, with the thirdplace time of 2:11.31.
Burkeys second place time of 
46.97 in the 100-yard qualified 
him for nationals in the sixth 
event.
The only senior on the team, 
Zimmerman, was voted co-MVP 
with Jay Smith of Johns 
Hopkins.
In the past four years, he has 
been voted MVP three times, 
and is Carnegie Mellons only 
national champion ever. Going 
into nationals, he is defending 
champion in the 200- and 500- 
yard freestyle races. At UAAs, 
he beat both of his national 
championship scores.
Zimmerman qualified for a 
total of six events at nationals, 
three on his own and three with 
relay teams.
Catrone says Zimmerman will 
be atremendous loss in the pool 
and [in] leadership when he 
graduates. Still, Catrone looks 
forward to his second season at 
CMU with confidence.
Men lose by 41
Fifth-ranked Rochester defeats CMU
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Contributing Editor
ROCHESTER, NYSome
times numbers dont lie. When 
youre playingthe number five 
team in Division III on their 
home floor, where theyve won 
23 games in a row, you expect 
a tough game. However, the 
88^7 loss that the University 
of Rochester handed the mens 
basketball team yesterday far 
exceeded what most people 
would have expected.
The worst thing about the 
game was that the first 10 min
utes were so close. Rochester 
pulled out in front early, but 
they never got more than three 
points away from the Tartans. 
Unfortunately, the Yellowjackets heated up, going on a 
181 run that putthem up 33- 
17 with six minutes left in the 
half. The Tartans managed to 
get back on the scoreboard with 
5:40 left, but the Yellowjacket 
lead ballooned to 43-24by halftime.
The Tartans chopped a few 
points off the lead in the early 
moments of the second half, 
but the game soon went spin
ning out of their control once 
more. Rochester exploded for a 
22-2 run over a six minute 
span that gave them a 67-32 
lead with 12 minutes to play.
At this point, Rochester 
coach Mike Neer began to go 
more heavily to his bench, but 
the results werent much bet
ter for the Tartans. The 
Yellowjacket lead never fell 
below 30 as Rochester.polished 
off the runaway victory.
Rochester center Chris Fite 
led all scorers with 20 points, 
while guard Jim Jordan added 
18, including four three-pointers. Sophomore forward Mi
chael Hosni led the Tartans 
with 13 points, while sopho
more forward Derek Dragisich 
added 12 points and led the 
Tartans with six rebounds.
On Friday night, the Tar
tans lost a heartbreaking 72- 
65 overtime contest to Bran
deis University. CMU not only 
saw Brandeis overcome a 13- 
point lead in the final 4:25, 
but were forced to overtime 
when Brandeis guard Steve 
Harrington picked up a loose 
ball and nailed an off-balance 
three-pointer at the buzzer to 
send the game to overtime, 
tied at 61.
Part of the problem revolved 
around cold Brandeis shoot
ing. In the first half, the Judges 
shot .310, including two of nine 
three-pointers. CMU, on the 
other hand, turned in a .500

The Carnegie Mellon track 
teams fared well again this week 
against strong NCAA competi
tion at the Slippery Rock Invita
tional last Friday.
Mens and womens teams 
from Youngstown State, Slip
pery Rock, Duquesne, and St. 
Francis all gave heavy Division 
I competition to the Tartans 
while equally strong competi
tion came from Division II and
III teams Geneva College, 
Glenville State, Cal State, Grove 
City, UPJ, Allegheny, and Thiel 
College.
CMU men placed first in the 
mile relay and the long jump. 
Freshman Jim Damato ran a 
7.9 seconds in the 55-meter
hurdles qualifier but made a 
false start in the final and his 
final placing has yet to be deter
mined. Junior Chris Maguire 
placed third in the 55-meter dash 
and fourth in the 200-meter.
Junior Brent Thomas and se
nior Bill Isaacs placed second 
and fourth in the 400-meter, and 
junior Shawn Pempel placed sec
ond in the 800-meter. Sopho
more Jim Langer placed third in 
the two-mile, and the combina
tion of Thomas, Damato, Isaacs, 
and Van Sprang won the mile 
relay for the Tartans.
Freshman Tushar Gohel 
pulled a strong performance for 
the Tartans when he won both 
the long-jump and the triple
jump.
Freshman Jason Grusky and 
sophomore Roy Devine placed

first half and opened up an 11 
point lead by the break.
After the half, the Tartans 
continued to turn the heat up, 
holding the lead between 11 and
15 points. The Brandeis shoot
ing picked up slightly, but it still 
looked as if CMU had the game 
in the bag. Unfortunately, light
ning struck in the form of an 11- 
point, two-minute run that put 
Brandeis within two, 5856, 
with a minute left. The teams 
quickly traded baskets, and jun
ior guard Todd Jenkins con
verted a free throw with 19 sec
onds left on the clock to set the 
stage for Harringtons last-sec
ond heroics.
The Judges slowly pulledaway 
in overtime as CMU managed 
only two more free throws. 
Brandeis guard Adam Machala 
helped seal the victory with four
free throws in the final minute.
Four Tartans scored in double 
figures: Hosni led the way with 
16 points, Jenkins chipped in
13, and Dragisich ,and sopho
more forward Charlie Connors 
scored 10 points each. Connors 
also led the Tartans in rebound
ing with 11. Brandeis was once 
again led by the Big Three  
seniors Steve Harrington 
(guard), Andre James (forward), 
and David Brooks (forward). 
Harrington scored 19, including 
four three-pointers; James 
poured in 16 and had 22 re
bounds; and Brooks scored 14. 
All three seniors are career 
1,000-point players.
The Tartans, now 712 over
all, return for their home finale 
against Emory University. The 
game will be played this Sunday 
(February 23) and will start at 3 
pm in the main gym.

Dear Members of the Student Senate:
I am writing to urge your support for a conditional phase-out of 
the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program at the 
Carnegie Melion University in 1996 if the U.S. military's policy 
of institutional discrimination against lesbians and gay men is 
not changed.
This archaic and irrational policy continues to be enforced only 
at a very high price. It damages thousands of lives each year 
with unnecessary discharges from military service. The process 
wastes millions of tax dollars with no positive effect.
By exercising an on-campus review of the ROTC program, you let 
the Pentagon know that this type of discrimination cannot 
continue  especially at academic institutions that implement 
their own non-discrimination policies. Your University can play 
reversing the current ban on gays anda critical role in 
lesbians in the military with a principled resolution on. your 
own campus ROTC program. I encourage you to support this 
important Resolution
With kind regards.

A court room became the stage 
for a team of seven Carnegie 
Mellon students last weekend.
in members of CMLFs Law 
Society played the parts of law
yers and witnesses in the Drake 
University 1992 Mock Trial com
petition at the University of 
Maryland in College Park.
The regional trial competition 
as based on a criminal case 
developed at Drake University 
in Iowa, iin which the defen
dant was charged with the abuse 
and neglect of an older woman.
The twelve teams who partici
pated last weekend represented 
a number of different schools, 
and took turns playing the de
fense and the prosecution 
through four rounds of the trial 
starting the trial from scratch 
in each round.
Each trial was monitored by a 
three-judge panel of local law
yers, one of whom was deemed 
the chief judge, in charge of 
settling questions that arose 
during the trial. At the end of 
each round, the student partici
pants were evaluated and cri
tiqued by the panel, taking ad
vantage of the unique educa
tional opportunities of the event.
Carnegie Mellon was invited 
to the Drake University Mock 
Trial Tournament last semes
ter, and Jay Devine, the associ
ate dean of H&SS and pre-law 
advisor, presented the invita
tion to the campus community 
through the Law Society. Senior 
history major Dan Fiore orga
nized the team, which was 
coached by Mary Jo Miller, a 
practicing lawyer in Pittsburgh, 
and by Mark Knapp, a lawyer 
who is currently a candidate for 
a PhD in history at CMU.
Both coaches worked with the 
team intensely for the past four
weeks, workingup to threehours 
a day as the tournament drew 
near. Even though Carnegie 
Mellon received the case mate
rial six weeks later than other 
schools in the competition, the 
students prepared a remarkable 
presentation and captured an 
invitation to the National Com
petition at Drake University and 
a fourth pi ace in the r egionals 
the only team to place other than 
four of the Uni-versity of Mary
land teams.
In Morrison v. Ryan, the 
groups mock trial, the plaintiff 
Marian Morrison, charged the 
defendant, Jerry Ryan, with
causing her to suffer unjustifi
able pain and mental suffering. 
The defendant lived with the 
plaintiff for ten months during 
1989-90. The plaintiff claimed 
that the defendant assumed care 
of her and then neglected and 
even caused harm to her ailing 
health. The defendant, however, 
claimed that he in no way took 
custody or control of the plain
tiff and did not willfully cause or 
permit the plaintiff to suffer pain 
or mental suffering.
Although the mock trials were 
not intended to recreate an ac
tual trial, the skills involved in 
making a successful mock trial
are applicable to real life. Knapp 
explains, Cross examination, 
thinking on your feet, respond
ing, public speaking, persuasion 
... are all valuable skills. No 
matter how much we practiced 
before the competition, the-ac
tual experience is what counts. 
Knapp emphasizes the rel
evance of the experience for stu
dents who are interested in go
ing into law-related fields, 
These students are already so 
far ahead. Feeling the pressure 
is so important; its an excellent 
preparation [for the real world].

Envelope yourself in paper, cards, napkins, paper 
plates and invitations at Papyrus
By KRISTEN A. BEVERIDGE
Vartan Junior Staffwriter
If most of your writing 
begins with trite 
clichs more fitting 
to a Peanuts comic 
than a thesis pa
per, and 
theres just 
nothing to 
be done 
about
ingyour style, maybe its time to 
pull out the big guns. When the 
ordinary Pentagon-quality 
schmooz techniques, using neato fonts and printing in land
scape orientation, just wont cut 
it, its time to resort to impress
ing with paper  Papyrus pa
per. This isnt the stuff used by 
ancient Egyptians with plant 
inks and styluses, but paper from 
Papyrus Designs at 319 South 
Craig.
The light artillery is located 
on the shelves lining the center 
walls of Papyrus. There are sev
eral dozen boxes filled with sta
tionery appropriate for any oc
casion: creative essays, response 
statements, term papers, even 
doctoral theses. Maybe the Ital
ian, hand-crafted stationery will 
impress your professor, or per
haps the initialized, classical, 
modem, colored, or black-andwhite stationery will boost your 
grade on a poorly written pa
per. Whatever your teachers 
taste, you can find some
thing to appeal. Or 
maybe if the note 
sized paper 
doesnt
appropriate for an academic en
deavor, it does make a nice ex
planation of why your paper is 
so bad.
Papyrus Designs also lets you 
appeal to your instructors sense 
of greed. Everyone likes to get 
presents, so wrap that paper. At 
the front of the store, patterns 
and color flood the space, com
ing from six rows of individual 
sheets of wrapping paper that 
extend from the floor to the ceil
ing. The designs covering these 
sheets range from fairy tale 
scenes, to creative floral prints, 
to splash paint, to animals; some 
even look as if theyve been im
ported from Mexico or Egypt. 
The imports will impress a pro
fessor reading a cultural history 
paper.
If your paper really sucks and 
packaging will make an appre
ciable difference, the store is not 
just packed with creative wrap
ping paper. Be prepared to spend 
a long time browsing and plot
ting the perfect presentation. 
Near the entrance, a large selec
tion of ribbons, as well as oc
tagonal boxes that come in dif
ferent sizes (some of which 
are perfect for hats  
maybe a real gift would
be appropriate), is displayed. 
Hanging on the walls are gift 
bags, and in the case under the 
front desk are pens and handmarbled desk sets. In the center 
of the store are even more good
ies: cards, napkins, paper plates, 
diaries, address books, guest 
books, decorated folders, frames, 
jewelry boxes, invitations ... the 
list goes on. Nothing at Papyrus 
can be categorized as dull or 
usual. This is the store to go to 
when you want something cre
ative and exciting  not the 
everyday Hallmark-card-shop 
stuff. A portion of the cards are 
handmade by local Pittsburgh 
artists, and come in sizes as large 
as those sitting on the front desk, 
measuring approximately 8" by 
8". Imagine the impression a pro
fessor would get from a huge 
handmade explanatory 
note in his or her mail
box. It shows you 
really care.
Last, but 
d e f i - 
nitely
not 
least, 
em
ployees 
help cus
tomers go 
through books 
of custom statio
nery, announce
ments, wedding and 
party invitations, and 
business cards. If youre really 
stuck, they can help you decide 
between the giraffes or the tiger 
print.
To really find out what Papy
rus can do for your imperfect 
papers, youll just have to go 
there for yourself. There is so 
much to see; 
dent
b e
suprisedifyour 
eyes wont want to blink. 
Make sure you have a large 
chunk of time to spend, and dont 
leave your wallet at home, ei

am to 5:30 pm and Thursday 
from 10 am to 7 pm.

Students limit phone calls
The average American 
studets university life seems 
to be a constant struggle to strike 
a balance between academics 
and working a part-time job on 
campus. The aim of holding the 
part-time jobs is to gain some 
additional source of revenue to 
supplement current living stan
dards  having no doubt al
ready expended their parents 
resources on tuition fees. I would 
have thought the logical con
trast to this would be that the 
life of the average English uni
versity student, who has negli
gible school fees (and thus very 
rarely works a part-time job), 
should be one of luxury.
My observations of such views, 
however, has lead me to the con
clusion that there is a definite 
paradox in such thinking. Con
trary to logical thinking, stuINTERNATIONAL 
EXCHANGES
by Oliver Williams
dents in England do, in fact, 
lead a rather impoverished 
lifestyle while attending a uni
versity.
Although being poor in En
gland is usually associated with 
gloom and unhappiness, we stu
dents give a whole new meaning 
to the image of being poor. In 
particular, my friends in En
gland use their negative finan
cial situations as a general ex
cuse for being tight with money. 
For example, when we eat out at 
restaurants, our excuse for fail
ing to leave the waitress a tip 
can be summed up in our fa
mous platitude, Were students; 
we cant afford to tip. Having 
eaten out quite regularly since I 
have been at CMU, I have reluc
tantly come to see tipping as 
second nature.
Furthermore, as an integral 
part of the wider discussion of 
our poor student lifestyles, En
glish students are compelled to 
be exposed to more of the real 
world than CMU students. Be
cause most students in England 
are no longer eligible to live in 
university-provided accommo
dations after their freshman 
year, we are forced to go and 
seek private, rented accommo
dations, which are in no way - 
subsidized by the university.
We have the arduous task of 
dealing with landlords, worry
ing about electricity bills, etc. 
Focusing on the private rented 
accommodations, the majority 
of students live in houses of very 
poor standards (some of the 
houses do not even provide cen
tral heating facilitiesgas fires 
are often substituted). In re
spect to private telephones and 
answering machines, most En
glish college students either 
rent, rather than buy, telephones 
or obtain one that receives only 
incoming calls, forcing them to 
use the cash that they cannot 
afford to spend on public tele
phone calls.

Junior Round Table offers a feast of activities
By STEFANIE MILLER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last semester, five juniors 
met with Assistant Dean of 
Student Affairs Tim Foster in 
the Wherrett room to discuss 
what they could do for Carn
egie Mellon. They decided that 
CMU lacked school spirit and 
class orientation and, with the 
help of Student Affairs, those 
five juniors became the Junior 
Class Round Table.
English major Graham 
Gibby was one of the original 
five members of the Junior 
Round Table. Gibby said he 
wanted to give students the 
chance to meet people and do 
things they wouldnt 0 any
where else. Niloo Sobhani, a 
chemistry major, and Lisa 
Koscielny, a information sys
tems major, two charter mem
bers of the Round Table, at
tribute much of the groups 
success to Foster and the bond 
between group members. The 
Round Table affects the junior 
class by first affecting the lives 
of the core group. Sobhani em
phasizes the need for enthusi
asm about the events and the 
CMU community in general: 
We want to make students 
get excited about going to 
school here.
Some of the events intended 
to accomplish the goals of the 
Round Table included pump
kin carving, Captain Crunch 
Brunch, Dr. Seuss Night in 
Doherty 2210, and Wings on 
the Cut. As attendance at the 
events indicates, the Round 
Table has been warmly wel
comed by the campus. Eventu
ally, the group hopes to be recV4
a student organization. Its, 
events are currently funded; 
and supported by Student Afi 
fairs. However, with the grow
ing number of student partick. 
pants, the Round Table will 
soon need Senates support.
The members of the Round: 
Table hope that by setting a 
precedent with Senate, other 
classes will soon follow with 
similarprograms. RoundTable 
advisor Foster hopes that as 
other classes develop their own 
support groups, the sense of: 
community at CMU will grow,.
Members see that the future, 
holds a great deal of exciting, 
growth and change for the 
Round Table. Primal Scream, 
scheduled during spring finals 
week, is a chance for students 
to gather and let out a loud 
scream to help reduce stress. 
Sleeping Out is another event 
beingplanned. One junior class, 
oriented event currently being' 
discussed is an Etiquette Din-1 
ner where students would be 
given the opportunity to learn 
proper etiquette in formal situ
ations  a chance students 
might not have otherwise. 
Thats what the Round Table 
is all about, says Foster, giv
ing students opportunities, 
creating connections, and cre-^ 
ating community.

Drake University Mock Trial 
competition team, the students 
prepared for tlie unknown and 
were extremely pleased with the 
outcome. Junior IMC major Eric 
Bradley stated that he found 
that the trial was a great chance 
to gain first-hand experience in 
the proceedings of a court room 
trial. He felt it was a unique 
opportunity that undergraduate 
courses in themselves could 
never have afforded him.
Junior social and decision sci
ences major Trupti Patel, who 
won an award for the best attor
ney, said the event was ex
tremely beneficial because [she] 
was able to experience the prac
tice of law from preparing the 
case over the last couple of 
weeks, to actually presenting it 
in front of the judges. Although 
Patel plans to attend law school, 
she recommends participation 
in the Mock Trials for anyone. 
The team did a great job pre
paring for the competition so 
quickly. I would encourage stu
dents to participate next year.
According to Devine, CMU will 
send another team to the Trials 
next year, if student interest re
mains. Devine also is looking 
into starting a Mock Trial com
petition here at CMU. He says 
that this years participants had 
a great time with the competi
tion and are interested in inter
acting with other university 
teams.

Young delivers own obituary in lecture
By BOB DIXON
fartan Staffiuriter
Hi, my name is Hugh Young. 
Tin a professor of physics. Ive 
been on the CMU faculty since 
1956, and this is my last lec
ture.
Last Wednesday, Professor 
Hugh Young gave his last lec
ture. Actually, it was the lec
ture he would give were it his 
last time before a body of stu
dents. As part of the Last Lec
ture Series, Young delivered a 
presentation entitled How to 
Write a Good Obituary, but 
added, I dont want to say this 
talk is my obituary, because 
Via not dead yet.
Young told an unusually at
tentive, bursting-at-the-seams 
Wherrett Room that the Last 
Lecture Series gives you a 
chance to say things you prob
ably wouldnt say in an ordi
nary class, especially if you had 
to meet that same class again 
bn Friday morning and expect 
to be taken seriously. He de
scribed the lecture as an oppor
tunity for students to get to the 
soft side of his personality be
neath his tough, hard-ass, lawand-order kind of approach to 
tilings.
The obituary began at the 
Beginning, November 3rd, 
1930. It was a dark and stormy 
night. Young conveyed his bio
graphical obituary from the tenpound, six-ounce beginning 
through college graduation and 
marriage to his wife Alice, to 
the births of daughters Gretchen and Becky. Alongthe way, 
Young remembered building a 
traffic light system to control 
the flow of the neighborhood 
tricycles at age seven, and in 
college at Gamegie Tech, dis
covering calculus, which he lik
ened to being given the keys to 
a Ferrari. The recollections 
were punctuated with samples 
of Youngs progression on the 
piano, an instrument that his 
mother taught him to play when 
he was little.
A major turning point in 
Youngs life occurred during his 
senior year in high school when 
a piano competition was sched
uled for the same day as a de
bate tournament; he went to the 
tournament and subsequently 
chose to pursue a career away 
from music.
At Carnegie Tech, the seeds 
were planted for what Professor 
Young would do with his life. I 
wanted to grab hold of bright 
young minds and I wanted to 
stretch them and pound them 
and shake them awake and 
make them pliable and recep
tive to new ideas ... and most of 
all to fill them with wonder. For 
me thats a big part of what life 
is all about, looking at and expe
riencing new things and even 
old things, familiar things, with 
a sense of wonder and a sense of 
discovery and a sense of aston
ishment  all kinds of things, 
physical things, a beautiful sun
set, the Grand Canyon, the view 
from the summit of Grand Teton; 
less tangible things, the beauty 
of a physical theory, the splen
dor of Beethovens ninth sym
phony, a wonderful sexual en
counter with your wife, the song 
of a cardinal greeting the sun
rise; wonderful things, all of 
them.
Much of the rest of Youngs 
talk centered around rock climb
ing and mountaineering, sports 
in which he participates. With 
these, Young emphasized dedi
cation, hard work, and perse
verance. Stories offamous moun
taineers and Youngs own expe
riences precipitated some gen
eral advice for the audience. 
Dont do things half-assed, 
Young said. If a thing is worth 
doing at all, its worth doing as 
well as you can possible do it. 
Pick out something you think is 
worthwhile and do it or work at 
it with passion. Do it with all 
your might.
While relating some advice, 
Young mentioned an encounter 
with a faculty member from the 
Computer Science Department. 
The professor told him that in 
the future, there would not be 
an aspect of life in which com
puters would not be involved. 
To this, one ofYoungs colleagues 
present duringthe conversation 
had responded, If you decide to 
go in for that sort of thing, make 
sure you plug [the computer] in
to a grounded outlet.
Young neared the end of his 
lecture with some additional 
advice for the audience: To fail 
at anything is painful  every
body knows that  but not to 
try is ever so much worse.... We 
cant all be the best there is, but 
we can all be the best that we 
can be, and thats what its all 
about.... Have some concern for 
the rest of humanity.... Let us 
never forget that those among 
us that are the most unlovable 
are the very same ones that need 
our love the most.
Young concluded his talk with 
quotations from Robert Frost 
and the statement Well, Im 
about finished, with the talk 
that is, not my life.... I am confi
dent that I am going to outlive 
all of you. But just in case it 
doesnt work out that way, when 
its time for you to write my 
obituary, I hope youll write me 
down as one who still has miles 
to go.

The four Special Interest Houses in the Margaret Morrison Complex are 4-bedroom, 8-person 
apartments. The three Special Interest Suites in Resnik House are two 8-person houses will 
include 3 double rooms and 2 single rooms; and one 7-person house consists of 3 single rooms 
and 2 double rooms. While all 8-person houses include 2 bathrooms, the 7-person suite has 
just one bathroom. As a result, the 7-person house must be occupied by members of the 
same sex. The Margaret Morrison houses include a kitchen and living room. The Resnik Hall 
suites do not include a kitchen. In order to be eligible for consideration for a Special Interest 
House, a student group must have at least eight members (seven in the case of the house 
in Resnik), and two alternates.
The specific goal of the Housing Office in providing the Special Interest Houses is to encourage 
situations where the living environment complements the learning opportunities of the 
residents involved and where specific educational goals outlined by the member-residents are 
understood and enhanced.
If more than 7 groups of students submit applications for these Special Interest Houses, a 
decision will be based on a comparison of the educational goals presented and the likelihood 
of serious educational benefit being derived from residency in this type of living situation.
Application forms are available in the Housing Office and must be filled out and returned by:

Valentines Day dazzles even non-believers
Under normal circumstances,
 I complain about Valentines Day 
as just another holiday that the
- folks over at Hallmark created, 
like Secretaiys Day and Motherin-Laws Day.
But this year, miraculously, I 
had a great day. So I feel that 
Ive got to chuck all those witti
cisms and criticisms associated 
with the most important holi
day in February (unless, of 
, course, you give other people 
Happy Washingtons Birthday 
cards).
Assured that I was going to be 
alone for yet another dreaded Vday, I suggested to my friend 
that we get a bottle or two of 
wine and have a regular Friday 
night. But being the well-be
haved under-21 children thatwe 
are, we decided to pursue other 
means of mirth and merriment. 
Or rather, my friend decided 
what the entertainment of the
C.CA-SW1Y3Tf 
YSWG1 1pC 4CY1pCA
by Susan Abrams
evening would be, and left me in 
the dark without so much of a 
clue except for its a surprise. 
Now, I love surprises. But 
theres a condition attached: if I 
dont hear anything about sur
prises, then I love surprises. But 
if I do hear something about 
surprises, then I dont love sur
prises.
The fact that my friend told 
me that there was a surprise 
simply scrambled my mind for 
the rest of the week. I would try
not to think about it only to be 
provoked five minutes later by 
incessant taunts of MI know 
where youre going! and Arent 
you excited about the weekend? 
and even a lowly Nyah, nyah, 
blpppppt!
Then my heckling rampage 
began.
I asked everyone who was even 
remotely involved with the 
plans, but no one would tell me 
anything. They just smiled and 
acted nice. Some of the filthy 
liars even had the nerve to say I 
dont know. And it wasnt until 
I threatened to not go out with 
them at all that I was given 
what they said was a clue. I 
dont know about you, but Penn 
Avenue doesnt tell me much.
The long-awaited day arrived 
at last. I got two cards, which is 
nothing compared to getting 45 
valentines with Garfield, Darth 
Vader, or Strawberry Shortcake
on them, but I realize now that 
its quality and not quantity 
thats important. So now that 
Im older, Im touched by cards 
that have simple Snoopy humor 
as well as sick jokes. After all, 
its the thought that counts.
The day wore on, and my 
friends still refused to let me in 
on what was happening. Id be
gun to resent them as much as 
going to the dentist, and I pre
pared a list of excuses for not 
going out later that evening: 
The man on television told me 
to stay tuned; I have to look up 
some really hard words in the 
dictionary; I have to stay home 
and see if I snore ... the list 
went on.
Unfortunately, I didnt get to 
use any of the excuses, includ
ing my favorite one, I have to 
study for a blood test. My 
friend came to my door, and 
before I got a chance to announce
that chivalry is indeed dead, a 
rose nestled in a bed of babys 
breath was thrust in my face.
Its amazing what a simple 
gesture like that can do to a 
woman. Really. I was completely 
mesmerized and immediately 
gave in. Maybe it was a trick, 
but it worked.
We ended up playing minia
ture golf. So it may not be as 
romantic as going out to some 
fancy restaurant where you have 
to wait two hours to get a table 
and the bill costs more than your 
last two paychecks combined. 
But like I said, its not the quan
tity, but the quality. I dont call 
a two-hour wait quality service, 
even if reservations arent ac
cepted and the food is deliciosso.
We had to duck several times 
while we were caught in the 
midst of a horde of seven-yearolds whose golf balls flew into 
holes on the other side of the
room and whose clubs whacked 
the people standing behind 
them, but it was still fun. I got to 
goof off and be myself instead of 
having to play tug-of-war with 
itchy pantyhose.
I had an honest-to-good qual
ity evening of affordable fun and 
had a blast, even though my ball 
got stuck in the windmill twice. 
It beats a night out on the town 
any time, and it made my 
Valentines Day different from 
other regularly scheduled days. 
I made it through the hype with
out a scratch.
Know how I said thank you? I 
let my friend win. Twice.

New Yorker gets conned at Pittsburgh local eatery
The other day I was thinking 
of what I would remember about 
life at CMU years from now: my 
good friends, the all-nighters, 
Spring Carnival, living in 
Schlag, my friend Jason falling 
into a barbecue pit, and the 0.
Call me sick, call me crazy, 
but I just love the 0. Sure, the 
place is disgusting, some of the 
people there are repulsive, and 
one helping of fries will boost 
your cholesterol level by 90 
points, but I still love the place. 
The O will always be a bright 
spot in my mind ... that was 
until last Thursday.
You see, something happened 
to me at the O which was so 
disturbing and upsetting that 
my memory of the place will 
forever be tarnished. It all 
started out so innocently....
Last Thursday three of my 
friends and I were hanging out 
at Hemingways, and after about 
an hour we were getting bored. 
So we decided to rent a movie, 
buy some beer, and do some more 
macho male bonding back at my 
place. After paying the tab, we 
went next door to the O, and 
decided to buy two 40-ounce 
bottles of beer. My friend Jason 
(of barbecue pit fame) was going 
to buy one bottle, I the other.
Since I had no money, and 
didnt think that the 0 would 
take kindly to my trying to buy 
beer using the barter system, I 
went to a Mac machine and with
drew $40, which consisted of two 
$20 bills (pay attention, this 
might sound like extraneous in
formation, but its really quite
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
important). Ill never forget those 
two $20 bills  clean, crisp, 
freshly-minted; those bills were 
so beautiful that I was seriously 
considering hanging them on my 
wall as art instead of spending 
them.
Anyhow, Jason bought his 
beer, no problem. I then went up 
to the counter, and was greeted 
by one of the many O minions 
who work there. I asked for a 40- 
ounce of Red Bull (dont blame 
me, Robby chose the beer) and 
promptly got a bottle. The min
ion muttered something which 
sounded like throw a tissy 
(translated from 0 to English: 
two-fifty), so I fished out a 20, 
looked at it one last time, and 
then handed it to the minion  
in retrospect I should have hung 
that bill on my wall.
The guy took my money, and 
then muttered easy (transla
tion: I.D.). So once again I went 
into my wallet, took out my 
drivers license, and waited for 
my change (here comes the per
plexing part).
When the guy returned, he 
just slapped my change on the 
counter, didnt even glance at
my I.D., and immediately began 
to help the next customer. For 
some reason I thought his be
havior was odd at the time, but 
couldnt figure out why. Then I 
noticed that my change was $10 
short. Immediately I took ac
tion....
Me: Uh, I gave you a 20. You 
owe me another $10.
Minion: No you didnt! You 
gave me a 10!
Me: No, I gave you a 20.1 just 
went to the bank so I know that 
I just gave you a 20.
Minion: You gave me a 10. 
Me: No I didnt.
Minion: Yes you did. See, 
while pulling out the drawer in 
the cash register, all I have is 
10s in here, no 20s.
Cop nearby: Yep, you gave 
him a 10, pal.
It was at this very moment 
where I realized what just hap
pened to me ... I had just been 
conned out of 10 bucks by an O 
minion.
Its an old con, Ive seen it done 
a few times in the past, but it 
never happened to me. The guy 
makes sure that there are no

$20 bills in the cash drawer (only 
10s), pockets the 20, and gives 
you change for a 10. Pretty 
sneaky.
At first I was shocked, but 
then I was pissed. I was so pissed 
at this grimy O minion for rip
ping me off that all I could envi
sion was jumping over the 
counter, plunging my hand into 
his chest, tearingthis guys stillbeating heart out, and showing 
it to him. And since I take ka
rate, I actually know how to do 
this (its called self-defense move 
number 7).
However, before I could scale 
the counter, my friends man
aged to pull me away, but ribbed 
me about getting ripped off the 
rest of the evening (love that
male bonding).
After thinking about for a 
couple of hours, I began to come 
to terms with what happened. It 
wasnt the fact that I lost $10 
which pissed me off so much. Its 
the fact that this guy stole my 
money from right under my nose. 
If I had lost that money on the 
street I would have been upset, 
but I would have gotten over it. 
But knowing that this guy played 
me for the fool, and got away 
from it... Im ... Im so ashamed.
I dont know if I can ever call 
myself a true New Yorker again.
So now Im 10 bucks short, 
still pissed off at that guy, and 
have a black mark next to my 
memory of the O. Im sure that 
my memory of this incident will
pass with time. But my memory 
of the O will now forever be tar
nished because of one mans 
greed.
My only consolation is that by 
writing this column I can make 
everyone at CMU aware of some 
of the penny-pinching taking 
place at the O.
I guess next time I go to the 0 
Ill be more careful with my 
money (and so should you) and 
scream out something like, OUT 
OF A 20! just to make sure. 
Either that or Ill begin to col
lecting $20 bills as works of art.

DIVERSIONS
By TRACY HAYES
Tartan Sports Co-editor
One might think that the only 
way to listen to good jazz is to 
run out to a small atmospheric 
club where a lone saxophonist 
plays sweet tunes for an audi
ence through a cloud of smoke. 
But this is not so. The CMU Jazz 
Ensembles can offer an evening 
oi exciting jazz entertainment.The CMU Jazz Ensemble 
is made up of talented musi
cians, both music students and 
not, from CMU, Pitt, and even 
the surrounding community. 
Both sections of the Ensemble 
performed at Skibo Ballroom last 
Wednesday, to an appreciative 
crowd.
*'The concert started off with 
the B Band. The band was im
pressive considering they only 
practiced once a week for one 
and a half hours. The first num
ber was a bright piece called 
Strike Up The Band, a Nestico 
arrangement, which offered the 
B Band a challenge in simulta
neous shouting. It featured an 
engaging tenor saxophone solo 
by Gregg Baimel. After his solo, 
all the pieces swung in unison. 
The feel is a fast two-four, with 
a" power drive that continues 
. from genesis to exodus. The 
band had a fair blend of sound, 
but the fanfares could have been
in better sync and someone 
squealed at the end.
The second piece was Time 
After Time, which was arranged 
by a CMU student in the 1960s. 
The music slumps along delight
fully in a medium four-four 
swing. The B Band director 
kept the band mellow, tee
tering like a rocking chair 
throughout the entire piece.
The best part of this song 
was the trumpet whinny 
that came at the end of 
Randy Kratofils solo.
Samba de Haps was the 
last piece performed by the . 
band. The piece was a blend 
of 70s funk and Spanish 
rhythm in six-eight time. 
This song was really great; it 
started out with the bass, 
then paused. Then the drums 
and piano were added. An
other pause. Slowly and softly 
came the brass, then a very 
lively crescendo; so far so good. 
Shinya Fujimoto was featured 
on the trumpet, and he did the 
job until the music got too highpitched, which ruined him for 
the duration.
The piece featured ex
tended solos, which trans
formed the sound from 
big band to chamber 
ensemble. Some solos 
werent that great, but 
what can you expect from 
such a small amount of re
hearsal time? The band was 
good overall, and they worked 
hard. What was really worth 
hearing was the sax solo by 
Micah Gaugh at the end of 
Samba de Haps; he was excellent, and the crowd loved him.
Smiles flashed back and forth 
on stage while the A Band play
ers waited for Morris to start the 
music. Morris put on his glasses, 
took them off again, and placed
them on the podium. Then, with 
the energy and anima
tion that might 
only be ex
pected
freely, with the ease of a pendu
lum, and the bounce of 
Morris foot was mim
icked by the .play
ers. It started off 
with a wonderful 
piano solo by 
 ' P.J. Oh. Ian 
 ! Gordon and
from the 
caller of a square 
dance, he stamped 
his foot loudly on 
the stage to give the  
band time to swing 
into After Mr., 
Teng.  i.
This piece was ex' 
citing and sounded like a 
sunny day. The timeswung
A bass run by Ian Blair slid us 
into the most mellow song of the 
evening, Miss Fine. If anyone 
fell asleep during this number, 
its a tribute to the playing. The 
breeze of the saxophones sang 
the melody like a mother croon
ing a lullaby. The song started 
out with the saxophones, who 
were answered by the trumpets.
They called back and forth for 
a while and then Adelman 
soloed on the trumpet 
again. The applause at 
the end of the piece sig
naled that the audience 
wanted the whole piece 
repeated. 
The last piece was, 
ironically, The Opener. 
It was very fast paced 
and exciting, with the 
same frantic energy as 
Beethovens Ninth
o Symphony. Solos by 
Gordon and sax 
^ player A1 Duncan 
Jr. were the high^ light of this piece, 
1 probably of the con% cert, and the ballJeremy Adel
man both played 
trumpet solos that 
dazzled the crowd, fol
lowed by a series of sax so
los that were all great, espe
cially that by Paul Alloca, who 
seemed to be the crowds favor
ite.

Gordon's solo was tremendous 
and energetic; he held some high 
notes for a long time and never 
cracked. It amazed me that, 
after the last two pieces, he still 
had the chops for it. Gordon

ago and now works in Pitts

Where to find jazzROSEBUD
By TRINETTE CHANDLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Nowadays, it seem as if every
one is on the jazz bandwagon; 
jazz is in, jazz is hip. I like jazz
 does that make me cool? 
What about jazz as a cherished 
art form, worthy of respect, 
praise and enjoyment? Why not 
think of jazz and be-bop as the 
musical seeds that blossomed 
into the phenomenal success 
that the music business is to
day? Everyone, and I mean ev
eryone, has used the jazz influ
ence in their music at one point 
or another. Rock stars have tried 
to funk up their songs with a 
touch of bass or sax to give it a 
soulful flair.
People just dont think about 
the history of jazz  real jazz. 
' Its soulful, melancholy, upbeat, 
exciting, racy, saddening and all 
that good stuff, all mixed to
gether. But there are some clubs 
that are trying to bring back the 
jazz that seems to have disapDan Frey, Tartan Art Editor 
Drrm6lm Eem6t7il Firn 
1t,7g6,l ,l Pi66h
at this.
Whatever Rosebud is, I like it, 
and I like its music. When I was 
there, Something Else, a local 
college-based jazz ensemble, 
played mostly be-bop. The en
semble is comprised of CMU 
alumnus P.J. Oh on trumpet and 
piano, CMU junior professional 
writing major Paul Allocca on 
tenor sax, and three Duquesne 
students junior Shawn Purcell 
on guitar, sophomore Jay Con
stable on drums, and freshman 
Paul Thompson on bass.
The group performed pieces
by Charlie Parker, Art Blakey, 
and later eased into a fierce se
lection of Miles Davis tunes. It 
got a little corny with the main
stream showtunes though; they 
couldve easily done without 
that. Otherwise, they were 
pretty good.
The crowd hardly seemed the 
jazz loving type, though. The 
extremely loud conversations 
and the sporadic applause, 
which seemed like an after 
thoughmore than anything else, 
were indicative of the mood of 
the audience.
More about Rosebud. This 
former warehouse turned cof
feehouse caters to an eclectic 
selection of customers. Most of 
them are not the type of people 
that I imagined as coffeehouse 
patrons. I had an image of people 
wearing all black catsuits and 
berets, cigarette pants, dark 
glasses, and Doc Martens; I had 
envisioned a depressed man 
named Og reciting morbid po
etry in a dimly lit, smoke filled 
corner. This was not the case at 
all. Instead, most of the custom
ers seemed like rebel Yuppies 
yearning for their lost youth, or 
bored middle aged couples lookingfor a reprieve from monotony.
Rosebud looks great. Its an 
industrial setting with post mod
ern trimmings such as spray 
painted toilet bowl balls attached 
to matching curtain rods and a 
really cool aquarium. Most of 
the big art was charcoal draw
ings of tragic Greek figures. Even 
the bathroom is a work of art!
At any rate, Rosebud and 
Something Else are two attrac
tions definitely worth checking 
out. If you want to be doubly 
cool, and enjoy great coffee and 
desserts and music worth lis
tening to, check out both on 
March 21. Just make sure you 
take an open attitude and proper 
identification.
THE BALCONY
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Walt Harper and All That Jazz 
appeared at The Balcony in 
Shadyside on Saturday night. 
They played a line-up of contem
porary jazz for about two hours, 
and the applause got louder as 
the night went on.
Walt Harper is the band leader 
and pianist. He is also the an
nouncer, music arranger, and 
manager of his band. When he 
played, his thick tongue slid 
slowly out from between slightly 
swollen, smiling lips, and a look 
of derangement came over his 
face as he peered out into the 
darkness of the seating area. 
That smile seemed to get
spookier as the night went on. 
Appearances aside, Harper 
knows how to put together a five 
piece band that plays together 
very well, and was pretty enjoy
able to listen to.
There are four other band 
members besides Harper. 
George Green, first tenor saxo
phone, has a full melodic sound, 
bright usually, but furious when 
he wants it to be. His solos are 
' always smooth, always full of 
emotion, and somewhat more 
traditional than the rest of the 
music. His rendition of My 
Funny Valentine is excellent.
The second tenor sax, Todd 
Preston, is a seven foot tall scare
crow of a man, who is also a very 
contemporary soloist. He is the 
newest member of the band  
an up and coming star, accord
ing to Harper, who introduced 
him before the intermission. He 
looked a little nervous on this 
occasion, and a couple of his so
los sounded a little forced.
Burt Logan is the drummer. 
He is the stereotypical black 
southern grandfather, a friendly 
and polite guy. His drummingis 
flawless, but he never performed 
a solo, preferring to keep in the 
background.
Cecil Valdez Washington per
formed a percussion solo. Dur
ing this extended solo, he played 
as if he were possessed, switch
ing from congas and bongos to 
snare drums, cowbells, and sus
pended cymbal, thenback again.
The fifth member of the band, 
Tom Beilin, added a touch of 
color to the room, Harper an
nounced to the audience (Beilin 
is the only white member of the 
group). Playing the electric bass, 
Beilin soloed once, in an impres
sive style that fit in better with 
the style of music than any other 
jazz bassist I have ever heard.
The music was very strong 
technically, and was full of emo
tion. The band had a very smooth 
sound, and they were into their 
music.
Walt Harper and All That Jazz 
doesnt have a conventional 
playlist. Well, they do, but they

The best sounds of smooth saxophones, swinging trumpets, and
mellow bass can be found on campus and in nearby Pittsburgh
play with the band, which he; 
has now been with for six years.; 
When I asked him why he played | 
jazz, he said that the question I 
was too deep, and that jazz is a 
lifetime of work.
Duncans solo showed the en
ergy and enthusiasm that I had 
been waiting to see all night.; 
Everyone else seemed stiff in; 
comparison. Hes played with; 
the jazz band for the two years J 
that hes been at CMU. He acted 
as if I should have known why. 
he loved the band so much. Be
cause its my life aspiration, he ; 
said, to continue to develop the; 
music.
The Jazz Ensemble tradition-; 
ally holds only four or five con-' 
certs a year. Duncan complained 
that the orchestra has one ev
ery time you turn around. He is 
confident that under Morris, who 
just started with the band this 
year, we will have more oppor; 
tunities to listen to and watch ; 
the CMU Jazz Ensemble.
Morris is excited about lead; 
ing the band and hopes to be 1 
very active. He would like to get 
the players to the point where 
they can all just talk and play. I 
It is important to him to develop ; 
the young musicians, because 
jazz, he says, aint goin no
where.
Morris feels that jazz is im
portant as a form of music. 
There are many musics that we 
embrace, he said, but [jazz] 
was grown at home, it was origin 
nated at home. He wishes that 
the crowd would have been 
10,000 instead of 66, but he 
was still grateful for the turn; 
out.
The Ensemble is definitely 
worth seeing. They are an excel, 
lent source for an enjoyable 
evening spent on  or off  
campus.
dont take the time to announce 
it, so unless you recognize the 
piece, youll never know what it 
was. They started promptly at 9 
pm with no warning, and paused 
for five seconds between each 
song, not even waiting for the

applause to die down before; 
starting anew. The first word; 
that was spoken was when 
Harper began to sing.
Harpers voice is deep, his 
speech kind of garbled, and his 
singing flat. For all this, his voice 
fits in really well with the mu-; 
sic, and Im at a loss to explain; 
why. His rendition of Love is \ 
Here to Stay came in second to! 
Washingtons solo.
I highly recommend Walt! 
Harper and All That Jazz ifj 
youre into contemporary jazz; 
and/or swing. They are a tal-; 
ented group of players who have J 
their sound together, and if you! 
like the kinds of music they! 
play, youll love them. And check' 
out The Balconys various deli
cious dishes as well.

Fate of network television programs revealed
Things are buzzing in TV land. 
Heres some of whats happen
ing, along with my two cents 
worth:
Destined to be a disappoint
ment. Young Indiana Jones, a 
weekly hour based on the astoundingly popular films, doesnt 
premiere for another three 
weeks, and already its being 
hyped as the greatest show ever. 
Yes, its produced by George 
Lucas. Yes, it costs a lot of money 
to make. Yes, ABC is patting 
itself on the back for staying 
committed to quality television.
And yes, it will flop. No show 
could be as good as this one 
claims to be. Viewers tuning in 
expecting something earth-shat
tering will walk away holding 
their noses. This could be one of 
the biggest bombs of the season. 
You heard it here first.
 The executive producer of 
L.A. Law has resigned. Seems 
that no one is happy with the 
quality of the show so far this 
season. So changes have been 
made. Even Warren Littlefield, 
president of NBC Entertain
ment, admitted that he was dis
appointed in Law.
What are they talking about? 
Am I the only one who has thor
oughly enjoyed every episode 
this season? Sure, theyre hardly 
perfection, and they might be a 
bit predictable, but its still highquality (and, at times, whiteknuckle) drama.
Granted, its a bit sudsy at 
times. Theyve almost run out of 
heterosexual couples to pair; it 
seems that every man in the 
firm has slept with every woman. 
The romance between Zoey and 
Jonathan does little more than 
provide a substitute for Kuzak 
and Van Owen, and flexible 
lawyer C.J. hasnt been visible
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
enough this season. The main
stays are getting a bit old in the 
tooth, but thats been true for 
the past couple of years.
The good definitely outweighs 
the bad. Entertainment lawyer 
Susan Bloom is a great addition 
to the cast, as slimy as Amie 
and as calculatingly evil as the 
late Rosalind Shays.
The character of Tommy, once 
chronically happy, has self-destructed. Watching his downfall 
has been fascinating, from his 
tiffs with Zoey and Jonathan to 
his questionable self-defense 
shooting of a murderer he helped 
free.
The best part, of course, is the 
absence of Kuzak. Harry hey, 
Im pretty damn good-looking, 
arent I? Hamlin was my least 
favorite actor on the show. With 
him gone, I suppose it could only 
look better.
L.A. Law has a chance to con
tinue for quite a while longer. If 
new characters with the 
strength (and uniqueness) of 
C.J., Tommy, and Susan Bloom 
can continue to appear as old 
characters make gracious exits, 
this show could experience a re
birth  a phenomenon rarely 
seen on television.
 Perilous Prediction #i. 
ABCs new cartoon Capitol Crit
ters is already a ratings disas
ter. Anyone with any brains 
would pull it in a few weeks and
give its Saturday slot to Dino
saurs, which will be looking for a 
home  and which could pro
vide decent competition to The 
Golden Girls.
 Seinfeld is damn funny. The 
hourlong special last Wednes
day seemed to last mere min
utes. The acting is fantastic, the 
characters are human, and the 
writing is unadjectivedly excel
lent.
Seinfeld is quickly becoming 
one of the most enjoyable televi
sion programs ever. A few years 
down the road, Seinfeld will be 
mentioned in the same breath 
as Cheers, Barney Miller, 
M*A*S*H, and other comedy 
classics.
 Surprise! Dennis Miller isn't 
funny. The Dennis Miller Show, 
a new late-night entry starring 
the ex-Weekend Update an
chor, premiered two weeks ago 
to a series of muffled groans 
from citizens all over this fine 
country. Miller doesnt have a 
home in Pittsburgh, which, from 
the sounds of it, might turn out 
to be quite a blessing.
What I cant figure out is how 
he got his own show in the first 
place. By the end of last season, 
Weekend Update was abso
lutely my least favorite part of 
Saturday Night Live  thats 
right, I even enjoyed the 12:50 
am filler skit more.
This guy was fanny at first. 
Then, unfortunately, he realized 
he was fanny. His smirking, ego
tistical look how cool/fanny I 
am act grew old really fast. His 
exit from SNL, needless to say, 
made me quite happy.
Apparently, no one else in the 
world noticed that he was no 
longer fanny. That was an un
fortunate oversight on the part 
of the rest of the world, because
now we have to put up with this 
talk show.
Surviving six minutes of 
Millers humor per week is one 
thing; lasting through sixty min
utes every night is quite another. 
If there is any goodness in this 
world, Miller will be on the 
Whatever Happened To list by 
June.
 Perilous Prediction #2. CBS 
premieres a new comedy next 
month called Torch. It focuses 
on the antics of a fire-breathing 
dragon (is there any other kind?) 
who moves in with an all-Ameri
can family. I give it three weeks, 
tops.
 What is it about The Brady 
Bunch? This show is downright 
addictive. I mean, I know ex
actly whats going to happen. 
For certain episodes, I even have 
portions of dialogue memorized. 
Yet I watch it anyway  over 
and over and over...
 Theres a big brouhaha brew
ing over Pittsburgh's New 22. 
Everything about the new sta
tion (which broadcasts daily 
from 3 pm to midnight), from 
programming to advertising to 
logo design, is handled by com
petitor Fox 53, which is in es
sence competing against itself. 
Thats not necessarily a bad 
thing for the station, of course; 
Fox 53 takes home all the ad 
revenue from the New 22 as well 
as from its own programming.
At any rate, theres some ques
tion as to the legality of this 
whole picture. A suit was filed 
by a station from another city, 
and recently employees at the 
two stations have begun to 
grumble as well. This situation 
could very well be a temporary 
one.
Personally, I like to see as 
much competition as possible in
broadcasting; in the long run, 
competition means that the sta
tions try harder to please the 
viewers. But it seems to me that 
the current , situation is better 
than the alternative: 24-hour 
home-shopping on 22. Theres 
no way that 22 will be stable 
enough financially to be a true 
competitor for some time to 
come. In the meantime, at least 
viewers get a choice.
 Perilous Prediction #3. Side
burns will once again be out of 
style by the year 1994.1 wonder 
what the Beverly Hills 90210 
cast is going to do about that.
 Shows that won't die  and 
some that should. It looks like 
Cheers will be back for an elev
enth season this fall. This series 
is simply amazing; never has a 
show that has been on so long 
still seemed so fresh.
Angela Lansbury has agreed 
to return for yet another final 
season of Murder, She Wrote. It 
seems that there are a lot of 
people out there who will never 
grow tired of watching Jessica 
Fletchers adventures; the 
weekly whodunit has success
fully survived every challenge, 
including Family Ties at the 
height of its popularity, and 
America's Funniest Home Vid
eos at its funniest.
The fate of The Golden Girls is 
still up in the air. Bea Arthur 
and Estelle Getty apparently 
have no interest in returning for 
another season, and I cant say 
that I blame them. The Girls, 
who once provided some of the 
most biting humor on television, 
have gone careening downhill of 
late. Its time for them to pack it 
in, methinks.
Bill Cosby, after extending his 
five-year limit by three years, is 
finally calling it quits. The Cosby
Show retires this spring, only 
overstaying its welcome by a 
season or two. Cosbys influence 
will be felt for some time in TV 
Land, however.
Spinoff A Different World is 
still popular, and talks are in 
progress for series starring 
Cosby kids Malcolm JamalWarner and Raven-Symone. 
Plus Cosby himself will show up 
on a revival of You Bet Your Life 
in the fall. All this, combined 
with endless repeats of The 
Cosby Show in syndication, will 
render the sitcoms passing al
most unnoticeable.
 And on a somber note.... I 
would like to publicly mention 
the death of my beloved televi
sion. This big, bulky, not-to,opretty Sears Solid-State 19-inch 
color model had been a consis
tent part of my life since 1978. 
Last Wednesday, it just stopped 
working.
In surviving 14 years, my TV 
exceeded all reasonable expec
tations and probably outlived 
almost all of its siblings. Still, its 
passing was a shock, and I will 
miss it. Only with great inner 
strength will I be able to over
come this loss. Ah, my TV:: I 
hardly knew ye.

Artist tells tales of barbaric aardvark
Cerebus is a creation that has 
jjeen as important to the inde
pendent world of comic publish
ing as Spider-man and Super
man have been to their very rich 
oVmers. In 1977 a Canadian 
Writer/artist named Dave Sim 
bggan to independently publish 
tfte story of an anthropomorphic 
aardvark named Cerebus. Ini
tially starting out as a parody of 
Cenan the Barbarian, the book 
has evolved over the last four
teen years into the paragon of 
independent comic book publish
ing.
Why the book has been such 
an immense success is due to 
the simple fact that it is one of 
the most unique, engrossing 
comic novels to ever have been 
published. Cerebus is the War 
and Peace of current comic book 
literature, simply because by the 
time the story of Cerebus is told, 
it" will form one complete six 
thousand page graphic novel.
- If you read three hundred 
issues of Superman or Spidermh, they dont make sense as 
a:story or as a life. When I 
started Cerebus back in 1977, 
uppermost in my mind was the 
thought that I wanted to pro
duce three hundred issues of a 
comic book series the way I 
thought it should be done, as 
one continuous story document
ing the ups and downs of a 
characters life, with no fill-in 
issues by other artists, says 
Dave Sim.
An attempt of this size in the 
comic book industry has never, 
and probably will never, be at
tempted on the scale that Dave 
Sim has successfully done. In 
September of this year, the story 
of this most peculiar aardvark 
reached the half-way point.
How can Canadian Sim bear
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
to spend twenty-six years of his 
life working on this one charac
ter? It seems insane! Can you 
imagine being a writer and dedi
cating your adult life to telling 
the life story of an aardvark? 
One can only guess whats going 
on in his mind, but I suppose it is 
because of the ever changing 
nature of the work that keeps 
him from losing motivation. This 
is not the story of an isolated, 
self-absorbed character. Rather, 
Cerebus the aardvark is more a 
vehicle than a person, an instru
ment to explore the complex ico
nography of our world in a smart, 
focused, sharply satirical man
ner. He is a character which is 
firmly entrenched in the life of a 
15th century world that never 
ceases to strongly parallel our 
own. In size, Cerebus echoes the 
works of the great European 
writers; but in content, it bears 
a strong resemblance to the everpopular Doonesbury by G.B. 
Trudeau.
The series up to this point 
has been collected in a series of 
large trade paperbacks, lovingly 
referred to as the Cerebus 
Phonebooks. Heres a little 
background on the ever growing 
story of this most important 
aardvark.
At the beginning, Cerebus 
was a nomadic barbarian, and
the stories themselves carried 
with them a kind of genericDungeons and Dragons appeal. But 
the book quickly matured into a 
political satire as Cerebus, the 
once sword-for-hire, became en
sconced in the political world.
Quickly gaining a cast of im
pressive supporting characters, 
the series grew immensely com
plex in a Twin Peaks kind of 
way. Names were dropped and 
seeds of stories that wouldnt be 
realized for years and years were 
planted. Cerebus the barbarian 
had suddenly become Cerebus 
the Prime Minister. The book 
passed from its High Society 
mini-novel to the beginning of 
the massive Church and State 
storyline in which our aardvark 
became Pope of the world. Bar
barian to Pope?
In time, Cerebus lost this 
title as well, and began to focus 
on romance, in the story entitled 
Jakas Story. The current 
storyline is called Melmoth. 
Please note that this summary 
of Cerebus does no justice to the 
richness of content that is out 
there.
Though the strength of the 
books is the writing, the art is 
pleasing to the eye as well. For 
years now, Sim has only drawn 
the characters while his collabo
rator draws the backgrounds.
The rigorous detail in the re
alistic backgrounds provided by 
Sims collaborator, known only 
as Gerhard, successfully con
trasts Sims own cartoony style. 
Again, as with everything about 
this book, its ads to the unique
ness, the feeling that this is an 
extremely individual, personal
ized piece of work.
Almost as interesting as the 
book is the artist himself. Dave 
Sim recently placed 22nd on a
list ofThe 100 Most Powerful 
People in the comics industry. 
Regardless of what that means, 
or what its based on, it is a show 
of respect for a creator who has 
not sold out. For Sim, there are 
no lucrative cartoon and toy
deals. He has rejected offers 
for six-figure contracts from 
the giant publishers of the in
dustry as well.
In. an interview with The 
Village Voice, he strongly de
nounces the emasculating tac
tics of the big publishers. I 
would only get 15 percent of 
the money. Consequently, Id 
have to sell six or seven times
the amount of books Im now 
selling to make the same 
amount, says Sim. Even 
when youre paid by distribu
tors, a lot of that money is 
generated by characters sto
len from their creators. Jack
Kirby, for example, gets no 
money at all from the Marvel 
characters he created, and 
Supermans creators only get a 
minor stipend from DC.
He goes on to say, Ive worked 
years to gain control of how my 
work is consumed, rather than 
lose control of it as a reward. 
Loss of control isnt a reward, 
because all they have to offer is
fame, which takes up your time. 
All theyre saying, essentially,' 
is, Well get rid of your private 
life and give you fifteen percent 
of your money ... and this willbe a fine deal.
Dave Sim comes to Pittsburgh 
this weekend, along with a large 
comic book convention sched
uled for this Sunday at the 
Sheratonin Station Square. But 
if you want to meet him before 
the convention, just walk down 
to Phantom of the Attic this 
Saturday. Sim will be there as 
part of his Cerebus US Tour 
92 promotional campaign.
To start reading a novel in 
the middle is perhaps asking a 
little too much of an audience. 
Its this lack of accessibility 
which makes the book difficult 
to enjoy for many people who 
enjoy more mainstream tastes. 
The individual monthly book 
are a very fast read, and at 
$2 per issue, the price almost 
makes following this title un
justifiable. These are major 
problems for new readers to 
Cerebus, and are personally a 
problem for this veteran reader.
Yet Rolling Stone, The At
lantic, The Village Voice and 
much of the talent in the comics 
industry laud Cerebus as a fine 
example of one of the best sto-; 
lies ever published in this art 
form.
If you have a lot of patience, 
ample funds, and a mammoth 
chunk of free time, this book is 
worth a look.

story with a couple of explicit sex scenes.
Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! tells the story of a 
released psychiatric patient, Ricky (Antonio 
Banderas) and a pornography queen Marina (Victoria 
Abril). Of course such a bizarre couple run into a 
couple of difficulties in this 1990 Spanish release 
from director Pedro Almovador.
There are a couple of steamy sex scenes in the 
movie, but nothing too controversial. The plot of the 
film is certainly unique and is an amusing antithesis 
of the stereotypical romance. Give this film a try.

Glory
The Civil War has always been considered a dark 
period in American history. It has been the subject 
of many documentaries and has been the back
ground of many famous pieces of literature such as 
Gone With the Wind. The film Glory explores the 
subject more, focusing on blacks fighting in the Civil 
War on the side of the Union.
Denzel Washington, Matthew Broderick, Morgan 
Freeman, and Cary Elwes star in this acclaimed 
antiwar picture. The movie provides a good ac
count of the Civil War with realistic settings and 
fight scenes. The film has the amazing ability of 
drawing the viewer back into the 1860s.
Although you may not have the urge to see Glory 
over and over again, it will make a lasting impres
sion.

Lethal Weapon 2
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back in Lethal 
Weapon 2. If you loved the violence in the original, 
youll drool over the sequel; it makes Lethal Weapon 
look tame.
Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) are the 
quintessential odd couple of policedom, and this 
time theyre taking their mismatched skills against 
a group of government thugs from South Africa. 
Diplomatic immunity is the name of the game, but 
the two cops have a habit of working outside the 
legal system and killing dozens of bad guys in the 
process. Remember to count the number of bullet 
wounds that Riggs has before he fights the 
penultimate bad guy to the death  in hand-tohand combat!
In short, the movie is cartoonish, full of near 
impossibilities, and has about ten thousand gun
shots. The acting is great, too. Dont miss it.
At 6, 8,10, midnight.

Suspect
Yes, its another Cher movie. Her hairs a bit 
different and shes not showing off that lovely tattoo 
on her derriere  in fact shes not showing off much 
in this mediocre mystery/drama film.
In Suspect, Cher portrays an attorney defending 
a deaf and mute man, played by Liam Neeson, who 
has been accused of murdering a government em
ployee. Just when there seems to be no hope in 
getting the poor man off, i jury member, played by 
Dennis Quaid, steps forward to help Cher win the 
case. Of course, one of his motives behind this is to 
see Chers tattoo.
The chemistry between Cher and Quaid just 
doesnt work. They will remind you of a fumbling 
investigative team on late night television. If you 
are expecting Moonstruck quality, you are not going 
to get it.

Waynes World is worthy of praise
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Magazine Editor
During the past week, I must 
have had the following conver
sation at least a dozen times:
Waynes World the movie? 
They made a movie out of a Sat
urday Night Live sketch? Youre 
kidding, right?
Uh, actually, no. They really 
did come out with Waynes 
World, the movie, and I just saw 
it the other day.
Wow... that movie must have 
sucked big-time, right?
Well, believe it or not, it was 
really good.
Youre kidding me.... 
Actually, it was a great 
movie.
No way. How great?
It was one of the funniest 
films Ive ever seen.
Stunned silence.
Yes, I know that it might be 
hard to believe, but Waynes 
World is a hilarious film. As a 
matter of fact, I thought that 
this film was so funny I want to 
see it again.
Oh, sure, the plot might be a 
little weak, and Mike Myers 
(Wayne) and Dana Carvey 
(Garth) might not look like kids 
anymore, but it doesnt really 
matter. What makes Waynes 
World such an excellent film is 
the fact that everyone in Waynes 
World knows that theyre in a 
film. Because of this simple fact, 
the film immediately becomes 
much easier for you to watch 
and enjoy.
Not once during this movie 
did I say to myself, I cant be
lieve this film! That would never 
happen in real life. Instead I 
got to enjoy the fact that I was 
watching a movie and witness
ing the talents of two really 
fanny guys, doing what they do 
best  comedy and poking fun 
at other people. And believe me, 
these guys take potshots at ev
eryone and everything in the 
movie industry.
From corny Oscar clips, to ex
cessive advertising in films, to 
the gratuitous sex scene found 
in almost every film nowadays, 
to ridiculously happy endings,
 Movie Review 
****7s RC4TNWV R?d/Dh Saturday Night Live 's Wayne and Garth 
hit the big time and poke fun atthe 
film industry and everything else 
in sight. Starring Mike Myers, Dana 
Carvey, Rob Lowe, andTiaCarrere.
this film leaves no stone 
unturned.
The acting in this film, which 
is surprisingly good, also makes 
it much easier to enjoy. Myers 
and Carvey work really well to
gether, and fit into their charac
ters like gloves, and Rob Lowe, 
who plays a slimy television ex
ecutive, uses his pretty-boy looks 
as a comedic tool with great re
sults.
Perhaps the only weak link in 
the chain is Tia Carrere, who 
plays Waynes love interest. 
Carrere is a good enough ac
tress, but her role is the only 
serious one in the entire film. 
She has maybe a total of two 
funny linesnot nearly enough 
to make her a great comedian. 
Still, she doesnt take anything 
away from the film. I just wish 
that she was able to add more to 
it.
There are also some great 
guest actors and actresses in 
Waynes World. Donna Dixon, 
Meat Loaf, Ed ONeill, Alice 
Cooper, and Lara Flynn Boyle 
all have parts. Theres even a 
surprise appearance of someone 
else whom youll definitely no
tice and get a big laugh from.
Finally comes the plot. As I 
mentioned before, there really 
isnt much to the plot, and it sort 
of falls apart here and there, but 
it doesnt really matter in the 
end. Myers and Carvey manage 
to pull the storyline back to
gether in the end with such origi
nality and wit that youll be 
laughing your head off while at 
the same time admiring them 
for doing such a gutsy ending.
As for the plot itself, the film 
opens with Myers and Carvey 
doing what they do best, Waynes 
World. Along comes Lowe, who 
sees their show and the opportuE.J. Camp/ 1992 Paramount Pictures 
RiMlm ZvMme6 ilU qiest Z'iewmM 6seoym i 7,6s rlI,estM g,6mh
nity to con two goofy kids into 
exploiting their popular TV 
show. We then get to follow 
Myers and Carvey around the 
suburb of Aurora and see what 
they dp in their free time, which 
consists of going to heavy metal 
bars, hanging out at the local 
donut shop, playing hockey, and 
singing to Queens Bohemian 
Rhapsody (perhaps one of the 
funniest moments in the history 
of film).
Eventually, Myers stumbles 
upon Carrere, a heavy metal, 
bass playing, robo-babe, with 
whom Myers immediately falls 
in love with and must have. 
But, wouldnt you know it, along 
comes Lowe, who not only gives 
Waynes World a regular time
slot, but also tries to steal 
Carrere away from Myers by 
giving her a record deal.
The rest of the film deals with 
Myers and Carvey getting into a 
big fight, Myers and Carvey 
making up, Myers losing Car
rere, Myers trying to get Carrere 
back, some guest appearances, 
and lots of outrageous gags. 
Waynes World is filled with so 
many crazy jokes and one-liners 
that I almost thought I was 
watching Airplane.
Waynes World might not be 
the most intellectual film ever 
made, but it might be one of the 
most hilarious films ever made. 
Watching this film you can eas
ily tell that Myers and Carvey 
arent trying to redo Hamlet or 
Romeo and Juliet, but are just 
trying to make you laugh, and 
theyll do almost anything to 
succeed. I fully cheer them on 
and cant wait to see this film 
again.

Red Genesis 
?V2
Red Genesis is the first in a 
new series of science-fiction 
novels from Bantam Spectra. 
This series, called The Next 
Wave, is intended to explore 
interesting hard science con
cepts in the format of fiction, 
and then follow the story with 
a short essay by a scientist 
which goes into greater scien
tific detail on the same con
cepts.
Author S.C. Sykes has man
aged to craft an almost-believable Earth of the 22nd cen
tury, with only a few flaws. 
This is forgivable, however, as 
it is these flaws in the Terrabound civilization that make 
her portrayal of the colonial 
life on Mars so interesting.
Red Genesis tells the story of 
Graham Kuan Sinclair, a 
young, intelligent, and fantas
tically successful corporate 
executive who is blamed for a 
series of freak accidents which 
causes the death of millions. 
Sinclair is exiled for the re
mainder of his life to the strug
gling colonies of Mars, never 
again to hear news of home, or 
even to own something as small 
as a jade pendant if it hailed 
from Earth.
Sykes manages to convey a 
formidably believable image of 
life in the domed colonies of 
Mars, covering many aspects 
of life, from the obvious down
to the extremely subtle. It is in 
this depiction of Martian life that 
Sykes is at her strongest. Unfor
tunately, the plotting and char
acterizations leave a little to be 
desired. Sinclair is almost god
like in his perfection. I found it 
hard to relate to such an 
unflawed person. The support
ing characters are interesting, 
but sadly, turn out to all be in 
awe of this god among men, and 
eventually begin to fade into the 
background as Sinclair achieves 
greatness again  this time on 
Mars. Deus es machinae abound 
in the plot, all for the purpose of 
increasing Sinclairs already

nearly-legendary status, down 
to the hidden reason for his exile 
to Mars.
Red Genesis is an interesting 
concept that works extremely 
well in certain parts. Its almost 
worth reading for Sykes vision 
of life on Mars alone, but ulti
mately fails as a story, due to 
the wandering, altogether too 
convenient nature of the plot. 
Check it out if youre looking for 
a decent step-above-trash s-f 
novel, but otherwise, dont 
bother.
 Brendan McFeely
The Ocean Blue
Cerulean
????
With industrial and techno
pop recordings bombarding the 
music market, the mellower side 
of alternative music has been 
somewhat forgotten. The basic 
keyboard and subtle bass have 
been replaced by the throbbing 
synthesizer and screeching vo
cals. But it doesnt look like this 
genre of music is going to totally 
take over and disappoint fans of 
80s new wave. The Ocean Blue 
have produced a fantastic al
bum, Cerulean, which is filled 
with less overwhelming elec
tronic noises and less unneces
sary screaming.
The Ocean Blues sound can 
be labelled as a mixture of REM 
and the Psychedelic Furs, with 
a liberal dose of Thro wing Muses. 
Each track on the album includes 
bits of bass guitar strumming 
and piano. Vocalist David 
Schelzel attacks each poetic lyric 
with urgency, clearly displaying 
the tone of the piece. The best 
example of this is on the track 
Ballerina Out of Control, 
which has recently become popu
lar with New York club and ra
dio audiences.
Ballerina Out of Control 
talks about a girl whose life is 
falling apart around her and her 
refusal to accept this fate. She 
twists and she whirls/ Dancing 
it all away/ Would rather see the 
night than the reason of the day 
is sung in a frustrated tone by
Schelzel. His singing style is very 
much like Chris Isaaks.
Other tracks on the album that 
are worth mentioning are the 
title track, Marigold, Mer
cury, Ive Sung One Too Many 
Songs For A Crowd That Didnt 
Want To Hear, and When Life 
Was Easy. These songs not only 
have a good melody line, but 
good lyrics as well. The band has 
grasped the concept that good 
lyrics still make a good song, 
despite all the C+C Music Fac
tory fluff which is continuously 
generated by music producers.
There are only a couple of flaws 
with Cerulean. But these prob
lems will probably be rectified 
as the band becomes more es
tablished. One major problem is 
the lack of variation and experi
mentation. The band stays in a 
slow-paced mode with its twangy 
guitar and simple piano solos. 
There are no surprises for the 
ear.
The Ocean Blues music is a
change for those who have listened to Front 242 one too many '! 
times. Expect to hear a lot of-' 
these guys on the radio verysoon. In the meantime, Cerulean 
is available in record stores , so;: 
go out and get your taste of The. ; 
Ocean Blue.
