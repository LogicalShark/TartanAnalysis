New Science Course 
For Maggie Murph
A brand new science career will open next fall in Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie College, when a four-year course in Technical Writing 
and Editing will be included in the womens college curriculum.
Dr. J. C. Warner, Carnegie Techs president, formally announced 
the new course as 150 science writers from various Pittsburgh indusrison for the one-day First An-*----------------------------------------------------

Th.
t/^> years or more in the minds 
of Dr. Erwin R. Steinberg, head 
of the department of general 
studies, and Dr. Margaret LeClair, 
dean of Margaret Morrison Car
negie College.
Dean LeClair said:
. For several years we have had 
companies contacting us and ask
ing if we had any women gradu
ates available for work of this 
tyDe. Some of our secretarial 
gj duates are already working 
house organs for large companies. 
Dr. Steinberg added:
As you know there is a 
demand for science 
Women, we notice, have more fa
cility in writing than men stu
dents. And many of the women 
science students dont, like 
compete in the direct field of sci
ence andengineering with men.
Many, of course, are working 
ir> laboratories. As more get into 
the writing field, it will free more 
men for other scientific and en
gineering work.
Margaret Morrison College is 
ideally situated for giving such a 
course. With the neighboring col
lege of engineering and science, 
the school of printing manage
ment, the division of humanistic 
and social studies and the College 
of Fine Arts close by, all phases 
writing, design, technical re
arch and layout are readily 
available.
During their senior year, Dr. 
Steinberg said, the students will 
be placed like internes or practice 
teachers, in various industries to 
get a working knowledge of scien
tific writing.
The Technical Writing and Edit
ing Program will provide oppor
tunity forwomen who like the 
scientific fields and want to work 
them, but who for various rea
sons do not want to enter science 
and engineering programs which 
are designed primarily for men. 
It will not be merely a standard 
science curriculum with writing 
courses added. Its graduates will 
not be engineers or scientists and 
will not be expected regularly to 
produce material at the technical 
level of, for instance, an engineers 
r^oort. Th program is aimed 
iv .her toward an entirely new 
field which is fast gaining pro
fessional stature.
Spring Lectures 
By English Profs
Next Tuesday, February 18, Dr. 
A. Fred Sochatoff will discuss the 
seven extant plays of Sophocles 
i, the Fine Arts Theatre at 11:30. 
This lecture is the first in a series 
of five presented each spring by 
the English department.
The series will be given in the 
Fine Arts Theatre this year for 
the first time and will emphasize 
the contemporary significance of 
the authors works rather than 
plot construction and summation. 
The lectures are open to the stu
dent body, the faculty, and the adiC^iistration.

Tech And Pitt
Cooperate!
Agreement to cooperate in a 
joint program for training better 
city planners and urban develop
ment experts was announced on 
January 28 by President John C. 
Warner of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology and Chancellor Ed
ward H. Litchfield of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. According to a 
joint statement released by the 
two institutions, the program calls 
for combination of complementary 
educational resources with each 
school providing both teaching 
and research facilities.
Under the new plan, students 
will be able to do graduate class
room and research work in any 
of a wide range of subjects which 
are essential for a planning career. 
The courses to be offered are in 
civil engineering, architecture, 
sociology, economics, geography, 
business training, public health, 
local government administration, 
real estate practices, law, and 
finance.
City Planning
Pitt officials had planned to 
make city planning and urban de
velopment a major division of its 
new Graduate School of Public 
and International Affairs, while 
at the same time, Tech was con
sidering a graduate city planning 
program in connection with the 
department of architecture.
According to President Warner 
and Chancellor Litchfield, the 
joint program will pool comple
mentary resources of the two in
stitutions and facilitate single, 
rather, than dual relationships 
with local, state, and national 
agencies.
Pilot Program
A pilot program for a limited 
number of students should begin

Professor Coleman 
To Give Lecture 
At Tech Forum
The fourth lecture of the Tech 
Community Forum series will be 
given by Associate Professor John 
R. Coleman of the economics de
partment of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. It will be held this 
evening, February 11, at 7:30 in 
the GSIA auditorium. Professor 
Colemans talk, Labor Loved and 
Labor Lost, wil concern recent 
developments in labor manage
ment relations and in union af
fairs.
Completing his studies at the 
University of Toronto and the 
University of Chicago, Professor 
Coleman taught economics at 
MIT before coming to Carnegie 
Tech in 1955. He is the co-author 
of two books on industrial rela
tions. At present he is assistant 
head^pf the economics department 
and coordinator for the activities 
on the campus of the Indian steel 
engineer trainees.
graduate in six years rather 
than nine as an employee-student 
participant of a new program ar
ranged by Carnegie Tech in coop
eration with local industries.
More Class Time
Under the new arrangement, 
scheduled to begin in September 
1958, an employee of a cooperat
ing firm will have hi's working 
hours adjusted to make it possf* le 
for him to report for late after
noon as well as evening classes, 
and he will not be required by 
his employer to put in more than 
eighty per cent of a standard 
work-week.
He will attend at least ten class 
hours a week during the fall and 
spring semesters, and three hours 
a week during each of five sum
mer sessions. This schedule will 
permit him a months vacaA-n 
from school work each year. Some 
companies in the Pittsburgh area 
have plans whereby the employer 
will pay part or all of the employee-students tuition.
Persons interested in determin
ing their eligiblity may telephone 
or visit the office of the Registrar 
of Evening Classes on the Car
negie campus.
The dates of Spring Carni
val have been changed to 
May 1, 2, and 3. Thus Queen 
presentations will be held on 
April 22. The place will be 
announced at a later date.
Given Congress OK
At the last meeting in January, the Student Congress representa
tives, after the deliberation, decided not to disapprove the new plan 
for commencement exercises. Dean Strick gave a detailed explana
tion of the new plan, which allows each school to grants its degrees 
in a separate ceremony after the mass graduation. While many de
tails have yet to be settled, the4-----------------------------------------------------
new plan will be tried this year. I # .
It i;~ patterned on the one now in President Jr ai'lier 
use at Yale.
The question of how Student 
Congress shall control Homecom
ing, Spring Carnival, Freshman 
Orientation, the Leadership Con
ferences, and the Carnegie Union 
is still raging. Should the chair
men of these events come from 
Congress, from the honoraries, or 
from the student body at large?
Should Congress retain direct 
control of these activities, or 
should it just supervise them?
Since these matters require con
stitutional amendment, it is very 
important that every representa
tive be at the next meeting, and 
that he discuss this matter with 
his constituency.
Next Year's Budget
At the last meeting Congress 
passed the budget for next school 
year. It totals $12,735 as compared 
to this years budget of $12,375.
Jim Houston, chairman of the fi
nance committee, explained that 
this money is given to Congress 
by the school, and is based on the 
undergraduate enrollment.
Susette Grove, co-chairman of 
the Spring Carnival committee, 
reported that plans for Spring 
Carnival are progressing smooth
ly. The committee has planned a 
contest to get new ideas for sor
ority and fraternity competitions.
Winners will receive free carnival 
tickets.

set two school records as they 
easily defeated Case Tech of 
Cleveland 59-27.
The medley relay team of Norm 
Willock, Dick Derringer, John 
Barlow, and Ross Engleman set 
a new school record by swimming 
the 400 yard course in 4:26.8. Der
ringer, Barlow and Engleman 
also won 200 yard breaststroke, 
100 yard freestyle, and 440 yard 
freestyle respectively to pace Tech 
to its easy victory.
Captain Mike Litch, a senior 
electrical engineer from Pitts
burgh, with victories in the 50 
yard freestyle and 200 yard but
terfly was the other double win
ner for Tech. Mike, who has been 
a double winner in three of the

Line Stars 
Against W\U
In their first away meet of the 
season, Techs swimming team 
swamped West Virginia Univers
ity 68-11. Tech won nine of ten 
events and completely over
whelmed the hapless Moun
taineers. Dick Line and Tony Chamay paced Tech with two vic
tories each. Eighteen of the nine
teen man traveling squad gained 
points as Coach Claude Sofield 
gave everyone an opportunity to 
participate.
Freshman Dick Line, a Mech
anical Engineer from Kent, Ohio, 
was outstanding for the third 
straight week. Against W. V. U. 
he gained firsts in the medley re
lay and in the 200 yard butterfly 
So for this season Dick has ac
cumulated nineteen points in 
three meets.
Techs team has been bolstered 
by some fine freshmen talent this 
year. Dick Line has three vic
tories under his belt and Norm 
Willock 2. Meanwhile other stal
warts waiting for their chance 
include Dick Stewart and Dave 
Harris.
The swimming team has an ex
cellent chance to go all the way 
this year to their first undefeated 
season. It appears that the only 
team possible in their way is the 
strong Oberlin aggregation.

42 Starting 
Teams Eye IM 
Basketball Cup
This years IM basketball pro
gram is the biggest ever, as fortytwo teams have entered to try to 
gain the coveted championship.
The schedule is divided into six 
leagues of seven teams each. 
There are several strong teams in 
each league and at this point it 
would be difficult to try to pick a 
winner.
The Rockets, last year's cham
pions, have a strong team back 
as they are being led by last years 
all leaguers Kemp Beale and Ken 
Ficery. They have a fast moving 
offense and are dead shots.
ATO A, runners up last year, 
are strengthened this year as most 
of their team is back, and they 
have also added height and 
strength in Frank Sobolewski and 
John Dobrian. They use their 
height to great efficiency and have 
good back court men to round out 
a fine team.
The ASCE Civil Engineers 
have been moving along at an un
defeated clip, led by all-schooler 
Cezevic and dead shots John 
Ralston and Dave Densmore. This 
well-rounded team should show 
up well.
Citcom has come up with height 
and depth, as they are led by 
6-4 Fritz Schneidmiller.* They 
have a good ball controlling team 
and are favorites in their league.
The Kappa Sigs cant be over
looked this year with the return 
of key Lou Montini to bolster
their backboard and shooting 
strength. They lost a great deal
from last years team but are still 
very strong.
Other teams to look out for in
clude the Beta Sigs, Grad Iggles, 
Betas, Englishmen, and the Delts.
This years contests should be 
hard fought as most teams are 
evenly matched. IM games are 
played in the gym every evening 
when there isnt a varsity home 
game. Come to see this years 
schedule  youll be seeing some 
good, clean, hard-fought basket
ball games.
SN Leads Bowling
After the first two weeks of 
bowling, no one team has domi
nated its league, although there 
have been some particularly im
pressive performances. Sigma Nu 
rolled the highest team scores 
ever seen in Tech IM history, a 
2491. SN also has rolled tl % 4 
highest team games (out of 6 roll
ed) and the 2 highest individual 
games and share the honors in 
the other departments. SM lost 
one point when Bob Marik 
couldnt bowl due to circum
stances beyond his control. ATOA leads this league, and the title 
should be decided when ATO 
meets SN on the last day of the 
season.
Turn Scores In ssk-,
All managers are urged to turn 
in their forms and score sheets at 
alleys to Bruce Bowen, or 
have thefn there to be picked up.
IM Night
IM Night is scheduled for 
Saturday, March 22. This is an 
all school event.
At Melpar our engineering staff is primarily 
concerned with the charting of courses into areas 
heretofore unexplored. The nature of our work 
ranges from the development of complete sys
tems for radar, counter-measures, data reduc
tion, computers, and communications to basic 
research and weapons systems analysis.
To encourage free, unhampered activity, 
Melpar has developed a unique basis of organ

Tartans Cop Two
Tlieil Routed 77-62 
As Soffa Shines
Techs Tartans won their third 
straight contest and evened their 
set Jfc>ns record at 8-8 when they 
downed Theil 77-62 last Friday 
evening.
The Skibos didnt have any 
trouble in winning the game as 
they jumped off to a quick lead 
and held it to the wire.
John TUcci led the Skibo attack 
in the first half as the ex-gridde'r 
couldnt miss and clicked for 
fifteen points. This was too much 
for the outclassed cagers from 
/i jtenville and showed the way 
to "Their defeat.
Again freshmen standouts Bill 
Soffa and Andy Komer led the 
Tartan scoring attack; Soffa had 
22 points while Komer garnered 
15 and cleared the boards with 
rebounds. Tucci came up with 19 
for the nights work.
Coach Cratsley has done well 
with this years green team as 
he has already matched last seasc*jLs record of 8 wins 15 losses. If 
Tech can win four of their re
maining 7 games, they will come 
up with their first winning record 
in over 3 years.
IM Playoffs
The first round has been com
pleted in the championship play
offs in IM table tennis and bridge. 
E^rh sport has sent four teams 
into second, semi-final round.
Ping-pong
In first round play the firstseeded Obelisks advenced on a 
bye and will play BSR-A, who 
defeated TX-A. TDP, also enter
ed the second round on a bye to 
meet Whitfield Hall, first round 
victors over SAE-A. The winners 
of these two matches will meet 
in the finals.
Bridge
ci the top bracket the Grand 
Slams triumphed over SAE-A and 
will face BTP, who defeated the 
Obelisks. In the lower bracket 
PKA-A, always powerful, defeat
ed BSR to me it the Whiz Kids, 
who downed KS-A.
Tartans Win Over 
Waynesburg 71-54
The Tartans took their second 
straight game and their second of 
the season from Waynesburg 
Thursday night by a score of 71- 
54. The first half was a see-saw 
battle with Waynesburg matching 
buckets with the Tartans. The 
half ended with the Skibos lead
ing 2JL-27. In the second half how
ever, Tech moved way out in 
front with the fine scoring of Bill 
Soffa along with the splendid re
bounding of Skalka and oKmer. 
Tech led by as much as twenty 
points during the period.
Tech Quick to Score
Tech opened the game with a 
free throw by Soffa and a quick 
jump shot by Komer. They led 
throughout most of the firsi half, 
but Waynesburg tied it up 16-16 
midway through the half. The 
Skibos were just able to hold their 
four point edge at halw time.
In the opening minutes of the 
second half, the Tartans hit for 
fourteen points while holding 
Waynesburg to three. From then 
on it was smooth sailing for the 
Tartans and they went on to win 
by seventeen. Techs high men 
were Soffa (who played all but 
the last two minutes) with 23, 
Komer with 13 and Skalka with 
12.
The Days When /
Carnegie Tech first fielded a 
football team in 1906 which grew 
and grew until in 1915 it romped 
over Waynesburg 88-0, and went 
on to beat then pigskin power 
Washington and Jefferson 6-0 in 
1920. Three years later the neigh
boring wildcats of Pitt suffered a 
7-2 defeat at the hands of the 
Scotsmen.
An undefeated freshman squad 
in 1925 emerged to upset the Big 
Irish of Notre Dame 19-0 in 1926. 
1928 saw a 7-1 record for the 
Tartans and another defeat for 
Notre Dame. Tech seemed Rose 
Bowl bound until'NYU upset CIT 
27-13.

On Saturday last Pittsburgh 
awoke to a very chilly blast of 
air. It was so cold in fact that 
there remained very little which 
wasnt coated with# ice. Indeed 
walking was treacherous.
With regard to the latter (walk
ing), the Carnegie Tech grounds 
crew does an admirable job  
generally. However, I being an 
underclassman and having Satur
day classes found myself in sev
eral most embarrassing positions 
during a single perambulation 
across the Cut. Unfortunately I
To begin with pre-determined schedules 
take a great deal of responsibility out of the 
hands of the studentsin a sense CIT is 
merely an extension of high school where 
coursess were meted out in much the same 
fashion. There is much to be derived from 
pondering possible educational paths, espe
cially under the guidance of a faculty mem
ber.
Further Carnegie Tech seems to be fol
lowing (or leading) other technical colleges 
in squeezing its students through a form.
The Tartan advises that each department 
consider this criticism and suggestion in the 
light of its specific curricula. Such a plan 
should be quite as satisfactory to the teach
ing staff as the present one, and should give 
the student a needed feeling of responsibility 
for his own education.
(EXditors Note: we of the Tartai| 
sympathize, Mr. Jankowicz. How
ever, we have come upon a novel 
solution to your very problem. 
Have you ever tried Ice skates, 
sir? As a group we purchased an

Editorial

Freedom!
It seems appropriate now with the begin
ning of the new semester upon us to review 
what appears to be a persistent problem and 
a genuine peeve with many Techites. This 
has to do with the rigid curricula prescribed 
by the Institute.
The complaint is a valid one. It would 
seem that a school is small as Carnegie Tech 
should need not be plagued by such strict 
regimentation as is apparent in the mass 
produced curricula being poured into stu
dents.
Of course, departmental curricula do change, 
but the changes observed thus far leave the 
curricula just as rigid as ever from the view
point of the student; each and every one sees 
before him upon entrance here a maze of 
prerequisites and required courses through 
which he must wriggle. His individual in
terests are rarely considered.
Would it not be better to a) require only 
certain of the more fundamental courses, b) 
specify prerequisitions for all courses, and 
c) then require each student to earn credit 
for a certain number of units in his major 
department, in related fields, and in social 
relations courses? An expanded form of the 
present departmental advisor system, which 
would make use of every instructor, should 
be adopted to give better guidance to the 
students such that their interests are more

Satires, Criticism 
Provide Areas 
For PiDE Contest
By Ron Abrams
One of the suggestions I re
ceived for WRITE entries came 
from a student. He said Id like 
to write about some shortcom
ings of the schools administra
tion for the Tartan. Of course, I 
would have to do some research 
on the subject, but that shouldnt 
be too difficult.
The idea appealed to me, but it 
could be handled incorrectly. An 
editorial of this nature might 
have the tone. Lets attack the 
administration for the heck of* it, 
and this would be an ineffective 
attitude, even though it is often 
done in professional journalism.
Source of Material 
Do you have one particular 
gripe about the way Tech is run? 
You might try to trace it down to 
see who is responsible and what, 
if anything, can be done about 
it. There is still time between 
now and March 15.
An afternoon or so spent in 
politely, I repeat, polite question
ing of certain members of the 
administration and/or Student 
Congress should bring interesting 
and informative results.
Rules for WRITE may be found 
in the Dean of Studehts office, 
150 AH. If there are any ques
tions address them to PiDE, inter

is that DuPont continues to ex

DU PONT SUMMER JOB 
GIVES YOU A CHANCE 
TO EARN AND LEARN
Du Pont offers college juniors and 
qualified sophomores in technical 
fields the opportunity to earn college 
expense money this summer while 
they learn more about the kind of 
work that will be open to them when 
they graduate.
The Company has 75 plants and 93 
laboratories located across 26 states 
a spread that often gives the student 
a chance to work in or near his own 
section of the country. Some of these 
locations have openings for summer 
employment in 1958.
Students work side by side with 
practicing engineers and scientists. In 
this way they gain valuable experience 
to supplement classroom theory.
Last year, 407 students from 113 
colleges took advantage of this pro
gram. Du Pont pays round-trip trans
portation expenses from home or 
school to place of employment. Stu
dents are not obligated to continue 
with the Company after graduation.
For complete details on this pro
gram, check with your college place
ment director.
SEND FOR INFORMATION BOOKLET
Booklets on jobs at Du Pont are yours 
for the asking. Subjects include: me
chanical, civil, metallurgical, chemical, 
electrical, instrumentation and industrial engineers; atomic energy, technical 
sales, business administration, research 
and development. Name the subjeet that 
interests you in letter to Du Pont, 2494-E 
Nemours Building, Wilmington 98, Del.
Personalized Training 
Relates to Policy of 
Promotion from Within
Where do your interests lie? What 
courses have you taken? What are 
your special abilities? Du Pont tries 
to match these factors with available 
jobs to determine your first job as
signment within the Company.
Once the assignment is made, the 
Company helps you apply your knowl
edge to a problem right away. You 
learn by doingin consultation with 
your supervisor and others working 
on various phases of the same project. 
Your performance on the job is evalu
ated periodically, so you always know 
where you stand in the eyes of your 
management.
As you might guess, Du Porft's per
sonalized training is closely related 
to its promotion policy. Almost all 
advancement h made from within the 
Company, so if your supervision has 
indicated that you are ready for pro
motion, and an opening occurs for 
which your training has prepared 
you, you are sure to be considered.
Although Du Pont employs about 
90,000 people, management authority 
is decentralized through many depart
ments into small groupssmall enough 
so that the new mans capabilities can 
be recognized quickly. This type of 
organization, plus the Companys 
steady growth, produces many oppor
tunities for tlfj new man.
Du Pont, over the past 25 years, has 
spent $1 on research for every $3 on 
production facilities.

Editors, the Tartan:
While I was in Germany last 
summer, I became quite good 
friends with a young chemical 
engineer from India. Ever since 
we have been corresponding and 
have exchanged some interesting 
letters. In particular, in response 
to my sending copies of the Techcal and Tartan to him, he has re
turned a most interesting reply, 
parts of which I have excerpted 
below. His reference to England 
has to do with his undergraduate 
training at Glasgow University.
He writes
Now something about the Tech
nical. I must say, its simply su
perb, grand. We also had some
thing of the sort back in England, 
but it wasnt so nice. Of course, 
the thousands of ads that you get 
in the States makes the difference. 
We had to count every penny in 
our case. The same goes about the 
Tartan; its really something. 
Why dont you have some columns 
about politicsinternational and 
home? Is it against the student 
charter to have something to do 
with politics? Dont you have poli
tical societies like we have in the 
Unis (Universities) in England?
I mean debating societies, etc. In 
any case give my best wishes to 
the editorial board. Tell them I 
wish them success. I have shown 
the journal and the Tartan to the 
boys and girls over here in the 
Club (an international club in 
Cologne, Germany). It was quite 
a sensation. You know from the 
Tartan we really had a glimpse of 
the students life over there in the 
States. We have decided to run 
some sort of periodical exchange 
with other countries so that we 
can have a better understanding.
That WRITE campaign is 
really a good one. I hope you are 
getting good responses from the 
juniors and seniors. Its really a 
pity we cant partake, but let us 
hope you can stir up the sleeping 
student population.
Good Criticism
I think my Indian friend has hit 
many of Americas and Techs 
problems square in the mid-sec
tion with his last statement. For 
example, last years annual his
tory essay contest at Tech at
tracted a total of 3 entrantsless 
than one tenth of one percent of 
the enrollment. This is embar
rassing in any case and especially 
so in light of A jit Boses enthus
iasm displayed in the above letter.
Furthermore, not only do most 
students (if they ^nay justly be 
called true students) fail to take 
an interest in the political and 
artistic world around them, but 
few even devote extra time to 
their chosen field of endeavor. I 
know of only a handful of under
graduate engineers who peruse 
technical journals at all.
By now I probably sound entire
ly too idealistic and altruistic to 
many of the readers. This, I feel, 
is also part of our problem: Any 
attempted deviation from the 
mean of mediocrity is usually 
scoffed at by the majority of the 
masses.
In spite of this bleary outlook, 
Ajits letter does point out that 
respectable work is being done 
and recognized as such at Car
negie Tech. Two questions, how
ever, immediately come to mind. 
(1) Why cant we do more? (2) 
What is stopping so many of us 
from imitating the lively interest 
of the club in Cologne and others 
in America who have not yet been 
bitten by the bug of complacency?
Yours truly, 
Louis R. Pondy

partment at Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, has made innumer
able contributions to the fields of 
engineering, science and educa
tion. His intellectual abilities have 
been recognized by a series ^f 
awards which include his Out
standing scholastic achievements 
at Yale while earning his Bache'- 
lors Degree in engineering and 
Doctor of Philosophy and citations 
received from the Government of 
the United States.
Dr. Williams received the Yale 
University Edward O. Lanphier 
Prize for Proficiency in Research', 
Yale University Prize for excell
ence in economics together with 
four other Yale University sch^.* 
arships. He has also been present
ed the Presidents Certificate of 
Merit for outstanding fidelity 
and meritorious conduct in aid of 
the war efforts in World War II 
and was selected as the outstand
ing young electrical engineer 
through 1942-1947 by Eta Kappa 
Nu.
Dr. Williams was recently 
awarded a patent for a rad-y 
beam rider device which has betti 
a standard component in guided 
missile control since 1944. The 
United States Government, which 
has been the only user, retained 
it on a royalty-free license and 
official recognition was withheld 
by the patent office until a recent 
directive rescinded its secret des
ignation.
Dr. Rossini
Dr. Frederick D. Rossini b ? 
compiled a distinguished career 
in chemical research, particularly 
in the petroleum field. He recent
ly visited India where he was the 
principal speaker at the Indian 
Science Congress held in Madras, 
India on January 6-10, 1958. Fol
lowing his address to the Science 
Congress, he conducted a tour of 
lectures and seminars, at universi
ties and scientific institutions 
throughout India, returning to 
Pittsburgh at the end of Januaij.
Head of the department of 
chemistry.at Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, he holds the Silliman 
Professorship of Chemistry and is 
director of the Chemical and Pe
troleum Research Laboratory. In 
his capacity as director of the 
latter laboratory he is engaged in 
highly important projects of the 
American Petroleum Institute: 
isolation of hydrocarbons fro*ri 
petroleum; purification of Ai i 
standard and research hydrocar
bons; and the compilation of data 
on physical and thermodynamic 
properties of hydrocarbons and 
related compounds.
Dr. Rossini is prominent also at 
the international level as presi
dent of the Commission on Ther
modynamics for the international 
Union of the Commission of Pure 
and Applied Chemistry. In Ju*f
1957, he went Paris as a member
