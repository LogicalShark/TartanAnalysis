BASE-BALL and TRACK PRACTICE.
In railroad work the speed time 
curve is frequently a reliable check 
on the efficient operation of the 
trains. These curves may be plotted 
by an automatic device attached to 
the cars. On electric cars the energy 
time curve may be plotted on the 
same sheet with the speed time curve. 
This will show the best form of speed 
time curve for the energy consumed.
Not many years ago in one of the 
large cities of the country, the motormen on the street railway system 
were given lessons on street car oper
ation and shown the best speeds at 
which to operate the cars to maintain 
the schedule, already in force, for the 
least amount of energy. A prize was 
offered to the motorman who would 
operate his car on the least energy 
per mile, proper allowances being 
made for differences in schedule, 
number of stops, etc. The saving in 
current during the contest was suffi
cient to more than pay for the extra 
apparatus required on each car, the 
time of the engineers employed to col
lect the data and work up the results, 
and the liberal prize given to the suc
cessful motorman.
Electric cars are made now so that 
the motorman has no control over 
the maximum acceleration which the 
car can attain. This is to prevent 
wasteful use of current by careless 
motormen. However, this improve
ment by no means makes the car au
tomatic; the motorman is still re
quired to use judgment and skill in 
the operation of the car or train to 
produce the best results.

TECHS FIRST PRACTICE GAME.
On Thursday, April 18, our team 
met Shadyside Academy in an in
formal practice game on the Acad
emy grounds. The weather was a lit
tle chilly, and was therefore not con
ducive to good ball, but both teams 
played a good game. Tech was strong 
in pitching, while Shadyside had to 
depend on fielding, but a remarkably 
low score resulted. Lyle was in the 
box for Shadyside, but did not have 
sufficient speed to puzzle the Tech 
batters. Burnside, at the same posi
tion for Tech, kept the hits well scat
tered, and had good control.
Barkley still does good work behind 
the bat, while Burgham at short and 
Elliot at third look good for all sea
son. Coach Wolf is to be compli
mented on the manner in which he 
has rounded the team into such good 
shape under such adverse weather 
conditions. Score:

The Track Association will hold an 
interclass field and track meet at 
Friendship Park Saturday afternoon, 
May 4, 1907. This meet will be the 
try out' for the Varsity. All men 
who make a fair showing will be 
entered in the college meets later in 
the season. Hfight men interested in 
track work should elect captains for 
the various class teams. They should 
get in touch with the Varsity cap
tain. An especial appeal is made to 
night men. Help this branch of 
athletics it takes up but little of your time. Begin training at once.

1911
1911 congratulates 1910 on the suc
cess of her banquet, but cannot help 
smiling at their fears that their es
teemed president was to be kidnapped.
In reply to some remarks circulated 
by certain of the Thistle Board to the 
effect that 1911 was accorded the 
courtesy of a representative/ that 
class would like to issue a statement. 
There is no record of any such invita
tion and the memories of the presi
dent and secretary fail to recall any 
such invitation.
T. A. Tate, the class historian, was 
appealed to three days before the 
Thistle went to press, to write up the 
history of the class. With such short 
notice it is not surprising that 1911 
has practically no space.
In view of the fact that C. E. Mor
rison is entirely too busy with the 
varsity schedule and other duties, he 
will no doubt pardon the attempts of 
the class to organize a class team 
without consulting him as chairman 
of the athletic committee.
Is it not possible that the basket
ball team will object to coming out 
five times a week for practice as 
called for in last weeks calendar, 
when the season is so long past?
Messrs. Stamm, Woods, Taylor and 
Werkman have formed a company to 
test materials by arbitration.
In AlgebraWhat are those hiero
glyphics?
Davis, A-lThey are higher Alge
bra.
Notwithstanding the fact that we 
all love Old Tech, yet the prospect 
of a vacation is quite alluring. To 
think, that the burning of the mid
night oil and the period of lunchless 
noon hours will soon be over is a con
templation which will bring the smile 
that wont come off to many a night 
students countenance.
From the way Harley, of 1911, 
comes in with a lady on each arm, we 
would naturally suppose our worthy 
president to be something of a ladys 
man.

On Tuesday, the 16th of this month, 
the Inventors Club met according to 
the regular schedule which has been 
established. Owing to the fact that the 
president, Neudorfer, could not attend, 
the meeting was called to order by 
Vice President Wallace. The speaker 
of the day was Prof. Knox, who talked 
on Some. Methods of Original Re
search. He said that the experiments 
with whicn we are familiar, are en
tirely different irom research prob
lems because, that while in the experi
ment we are looking for a certain defi
nite result, in the research problem 
we do not know what the result is 
going to be. He pointed out the many 
difficulties that are liable to be en
countered in the course of original re
search, and gave the experience of 
Prof. Kolrausch in this kind of work, 
where this learned scientist learned 
to expect about twelve times the num
ber of obstacles which occurred to 
him at first.

JUNIOR PROMENADE.
Now that the committee has made 
the final report t*> the class, regarding 
plans and costs of the Junior Prom
enade, it is the duty of each 1908 stu
dent in the school of Applied Science 
to give his assistance toward making 
the project a success. We trust that 
more of the men will attend than 
those who signified their intention of 
doing so at the last class meeting. 
The committee was governed entirely 
in the plans of the affair by the num
ber of men who voted in the affirma
tive, when it was proposed. Hence 
the discouragement of the committee 
when scarcely one-half this number 
agree to be present after the plans 
have been formulated.
It is necessary that sixty-five of the 
class attend in order that the prom
enade shall be successful. It is up to 
you, Juniors!
---------o---------
CIVIL DEPARTMENT.
The students and professors of the 
Civil Department feel well paid for 
the efforts put forth to make the dis
play in the Civil Department an in
teresting and impressive one to the 
visitors. The bridge and roof truss 
built by Messrs. Siesel and Apple
gate, under the direct supervision of 
Prof. Thayer, brought forth many 
words of praise. The progress of the 
Civil Department has been greatly 
hindered by lack of necessary space 
and material, but the deep interest 
taken by both students and professors 
is rapidly advancing it to the front.
MASK AND WIG PERFORMANCE.
On Saturday last, the Mask and Wig 
Club of the University of Pennsylva
nia, gave two performances at the 
Belasco of Herr Lohengrin. A short 
burlesque of Maude Adams in Peter 
Pan was also given during the last 
act. Tne music was borrowed from 
up-to-date comic operea, but the score 
has been written by students. The 
singing was not so good as that of the 
Triangle Club, neither individually nor 
collectively. Some of the dances, for 
which the Mask and Wig is famous, 
were encored again and again. Much 
fun was made of Pittsburg atmos
phere and conditions and Tech came 
in for a gentle dig. A novel feature 
was the showing of pictures of stu
dent life at Penn, between the first 
and second acts. On the whole, Prince
ton seems to have had a little the 
better of it this year, both in the 
comedy and musical parts.------o-------

UNIVERSITY ENGLISH.
If there were any doubt that Dr. Van 
Dyke, the professor of English at 
Princeton is needed there, it would be 
dissipated by a perusal of the resolutions 
in which the university faculty asks 
him to consider his resignation. The 
resolutions say: They (the members of 
the faculty), earnestly request him to re
consider his present determination, and
to remain in the professorship he has 
adorned with rare distinction, and to 
continue in our midst his manifold 
work. Perhaps on reading this touch
ing tribute Dr. Van Dyke will agree to 
return to Princeton and give a course in 
English for the college instructors, lay
ing special emphasis on the consistent 
use of personal pronouns though when 
he ponders upon the reference to his 
manifold work in the facultys midst 
he may be a trifle puzzled. The phrase 
sounds as -if he had been a thorn in 
the flesh, at the very least.

motives used on the Manhattan Ele
vated Railway before the electrifica
tion of the road. Nos. 3 and 4 are 
taken from interurban cars operating 
between Cleveland and the adjoining 
towns. There is a slight change in 
the slope of these lines near the mid
dle. This drop in acceleration is due 
to the fact that the change from series 
to parallel connection of the motors 
was made at that moment. The in
troduction of resistance into the cir
cuit preliminary to making the change 
caused the motors to run at a uniform 
speed for a short time. Curve No. 6 
does not show such a jump in the 
curve, the mechanism being so con
structed as to give a uniformly ac
celerated motion of six miles per hour 
per second. The car reaches its'max
imum speed of 40 miles per hour in 
about ten seconds. Compare this 
with the time required for the C., B. &

run between two stations a mile apart 
in 140 seconds. As the acceleration 
is increased the maximum speed is 
decreased and the time during which 
the motors operate is decreased. The 
higher accelerations are reached by 
more powerful motors. The train 
friction is practically a constant quan

There is a slight rise in the curve at 
the point of maximum speed. Be
neath this rise near the line of zero 
speed is a note indicating that this 
rise is due to a sudden change in the 
grade of the road, causing the car to 
increase its speed.

The drawings sent to New York 
were the products of good draughts
manship and art, and our previous 
record of many mentions will un
doubtedly be broken. When the 
drawings are returned we expect to 
learn that we took at least ten 
firsts.
T. A. C.s are going to win two im
portant games this weekfirst one 
from Plebes on Thursday, and Second 
from the Varsity on Friday.
We appreciate the sympathy and 
offered hospitality of our fellow stu
dents.
Why so many cops? #
The smile that wont come off.
On Monday morning that famous 
hard-working crowd of men, widely 
known as the Architects, found a 
heavily armed body guarding their 
studio. Immediately they began to 
question the cause for this and found 
that the wise and humane contractor, 
Mr. Gilbert, had caused this state of 
affairs in order to restrain the said 
hard-workers from overtaxing their 
physical strength. The guards re
fused to give the boys their instru
ments, but gladly gave them bats, 
balls, etc., showing their extreme sen
sible way of looking at the question.
The T. A. C. held the term election 
and the following men were elected:
M. SteenPresident.
P. N. HarrisonVice President.
A. R. RenderSecretary.
K. GloeklerTreasurer.
M. C. SpahrMarshal Base-ball

guard of honor, Tjy the notables of the 
academic procession, and all who were 
privileged to witness the pretty spec
tacle pronounce it praise well merit

long lines inside the institute, with 
the standard-bearers holding positions 
at the top of the grand stair-case.

Very much like handing ones self a
