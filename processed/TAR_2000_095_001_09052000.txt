Presidential candidate Al Gore speaks 
in Pittsburgh about working families
by Seth Mandel
Managing Editor
& Aseem Gupta 
Webmaster
CMU students arent the only 
ones in Pittsburgh pulling allnighters. In the 22nd hour of his 
sleepless Labor Day campaign tour, 
Vice President and Democratic 
Presidential candidate Al Gore 
spoke at a rally yesterday at Point 
State Park after an early morning 
flight from Florida. The six-state 
tour focused on Gores slogan - 
Fighting for Americas Working 
Families.
Gore joined Pittsburghs holiday 
celebration at the tail end of the 
citys Labor Day parade, which 
concluded at the Point. Also in 
attendance at the event were 
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, the 
Reverend Jesse Jackson, and U.S. 
Senate candidate Ron Klink.
Gore spoke to a crowd of over 
10,000, many of whom marched in 
the parade with their respective 
unions. The speech focused heavi
ly on Gores support of labor 
unions and issues pertaining to 
American workers. Labor leaders, 
including the President of the AFLCIO John Sweeney joined Gore on 
stage.
Addressing Union members,
Gore said I want you to know that 
I am going to fight for you and 
stand up for you.
The Vice President spoke of 
what he viewed to be the greatest 
successes of the past eight years 
under the Clinton administration: 
a large budget surplus, a strong 
stock market, and low minority 
unemployment. Let me be clear. I 
am not satisfied, he said. You 
aint seen nothing yet. We have a 
lot of work to do.
While the speech focused pri
marily on labor issues of interest to 
the thousands of union members 
present, Gore also took time to 
speak to the young and elderly 
people present in the crowd. 
Weve got to invest in education, 
health care, and middle class tax 
cuts, said Gore. I think we ought 
to make most college tuition tax 
deductible.
Contrasting his policies with 
those of his opponent, Texas 
Governor George W. Bush, Gore 
said he hopes that working fami
lies can benefit from the strong 
economy along with Americas 
upper classes. Now is the time to 
ensure that our prosperity enrich
es not just a few but all our fami
lies, said Gore.
However, not everyone attend
ing todays rally was a Gore sup
porter. I think in this new econo
my, people have realized the pow
ers and abilities they have to suc
ceed and would rather have gov
ernment step out the way instead 
of demonizing those who become 
successful. If Al Gore truly wanted 
to fight for all Americans as he 
says, he would end this 1960sstyle class-warfare technique of 
pitting Americans against each 
other, said Russell Snyder, mem
ber of the College Republicans and 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering and economics major.
The speech ended with fireSee GORE, page 5

University names 
Kamlet as Provost
by Aseem Gupta
Webmaster
With the departure of Dr. Paul 
Christiano from the position of 
University Provost, Carnegie 
Mellon was left with big shoes to 
fill, in the words of Mark Kamlet, 
Christianos successor. Kamlet, for
mer dean of the Heinz School of 
Public Policy and Management, 
was named Carnegie Mellons new 
Provost over the summer after serv
ing as dean of the Heinz school 
since 1993.
I am very excited, said Kamlet. 
This is a tremendous University 
and it is an honor to serve as 
provost. While under Kamlets 
leadership, the Heinz School made 
great advances  the schools 
endowment increased by over 80 
percent while its funding for 
research projects grew 400 percent. 
Furthermore, two major centers 
were founded during Kamlets 
tenure  the Carnegie Mellon 
Census Data Research Center and 
the Center for Arts and 
Management Technology.
I am very pleased that Dean 
Kamlet has joined the central 
administration team said 
President Jared L. Cohon in a 
recent edition of the Carnegie 
Mellon News of Kamlets appoint
ment. He will bring creativity, 
strong academic credentials and a 
successful record of administrative 
leadership to the provosts position. 
We all look forward to working 
with him in his new capacity.
Kamlet said that he will work to 
enhance the undergraduate experi
ence. The University has been on 
such a tremendous role over the 
past many years, he said. Focusing 
on the meta-curriculum," Kamlet 
said that he would like to see more 
learning taking place outside of the 
classroom. Further, Kamlet said 
that he would be placing particular 
emphasis on humanities and the 
arts. Those are areas at present 
that we want to take to the next 
level, said Kamlet.
The new Provost noted that the 
University has received $800,000 
in funding from the A.W. Mellon 
Foundation for a new center for 
arts and society. Describing it as an 
intersection between the School of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
and the College of Fine Arts, 
Kamlet used the new center as an 
example of the increased emphasis 
that the University was going to put 
on humanities and arts. Further, 
Kamlet said that facilities on cam
pus will be upgraded and consoli

Serial rapist strikes surrounding area CMU mourns death of Chief LaPaglia
by Cam Crews
Staffwriter
Four rapes have occurred locally 
over the past three months, 
prompting a joint effort between 
CMU and Pittsburgh police. The 
string of crimes on the eastern 
fringe of Pittsburgh reach as close
as Oakland and Squirrel Hill and all 
occurred late at night in apartment 
complexes, police said.
Authorities believe the same man 
is responsible for all of these crimes 
since each of the rapes occurred 
under similar circumstances, with_ in relatively close proximity to one 
: another, and victims hav-reported 
consistent physical descriptions of
their assailant. Each of the rapes 
occurred between 2 am and 4 am 
and without signs of forced entry.
The crimes occurred on June 22 
in Swissvale, June 27 in Oakland, 
July 7 in Edgewood, and August 8 
in Squirrel Hill. The suspect is^ 
described as a black male in his late 
20s with a thick build, about six

Student Government works to allocate 
budget surpluses from previous year
BySeth Mandel 
Managing Editor
How could $123,600 best be 
spent to improve life for students at 
Carnegie Mellon? This is the ques
tion that Student Government lead
ers will soon pose to students, as 
they try to decide how to most 
effectively spend their surplus from 
the previous fiscal year. Last year, 
Student Government allocated over 
$700,000 in funds received from 
the student activities fee to student
organizations. Most of those orga
nizations did not spend all of the 
money they were given, which has 
lead to the current situation, said 
Student Body Treasurer David 
Liber, a senior ethics, history, and 
public policy major.
Liber said that he will soon publi
cize the details of how students can 
submit proposals suggesting how to 
spend the money. Some ideas he 
expects students to suggest include

On Monday, August 21, 
Carnegie Mellon Police Chief Jim 
LaPaglia died of a heart attack at 
his home at the age of 53. LaPaglia 
was recovering from heart surgery 
after previously being hospitalized 
for suffering a re-occurrence of a 
heart problem that occurred in 
late July.
Chief LaPaglia provided superb 
leadership of our campus police 
for 13 years, said President Cohon 
about the late chief. I especially 
value his emphasis on education 
and training and his great success 
in developing a supportive and 
sensitive police force. Jim has left 
us a legacy for which we should all 
be thankful and I am committed to 
sustaining.
Throughout his career at CMU,
LaPaglia helped to distinguish the 
University Police Force in many 
ways. He increased the amount of 
training for police officers to 70 
hours a year. He also worked to 
reduce the amount of alcohol 
abuse and underage drinking on 
campus, through his creation of an 
internal citation system. His ener
getic approach to crime prevention 
was also one of LaPaglias greatest 
achievements at CMU.
Jim was a pioneer for our 
department, said Leroy Adams, a 
Carnegie Mellon police officer for 
the past 30 years. Weve had 
more training under Jim than 
under any other police chief at the 
University.
The issue of police ethics was 
also very important to LaPaglia. 
While he was chief, the CMU 
Campus Police Department was 
twice honored by the National 
Institute of Ethics and presented
with a Certificate of Integrity. In 
1998 Carnegie Mellons campus 
police force became the first police 
department in the country to com
plete the institutes ethics training 
program.
LaPaglia also worked hard to 
improve other police forces in 
addition to his work at CMU. He 
served as a consultant and instruc
tor for the Pennsylvania Police 
Officers Education and Training 
Commission, where he developed 
courses on leadership, communi
cations, and management. 
LaPaglia worked with the 
Pittsburgh Police Department to 
establish a course on ethics, and 
was also an instructor at the 
Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania, Allegheny County, 
and Pittsburgh Police Academies.
Campus Police Officer Ronald 
Pudlowski notes that he will espeSee LAPAGLIA, page 5

would help improve student life,

people come up with. I think some 
of the best ideas might come by 
freshmen, who may have a better

With over 1,300 students from 31 
foreign countries and 45 US states, the 
Class of 2004 is one of the largest and 
most diverse classes to attend Carnegie 
Mellon. The class arrived for their ori
entation on Tuesday, August 22. 
Orientation Counselors (OC) and 
Residential Advisors (RA) had already 
been through weeks of training and 
had big plans in store to introduce the 
new students to both the social and 
academic side of CMU.
This year Orientation involved a 
number of traditional favorites, such as 
Playfair, Convocation, and Clippership, 
but also added some new events. One 
such event was an exhibit in the UC Art 
Gallery called 1-3-5-7, the original 
number of first-year students. The 
exhibit featured submissions, such as 
photos and prose, that showcased the 
various talents of the incoming class.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5, 2000
IRE+^ OF
Pope beatifies disputed Pius IX
National News
VATICAN CITY (AP)  Pope 
John Paul II advanced two of his 
predecessors toward sainthood 
Sunday in one of the most disputed 
such acts of his papacy, beatifying 
the 19th centurys much-attacked 
Pius IX alongside the 20th centurys 
much-beloved John XXIII.
Jews bitterly protested John 
Pauls recognition of Pius, who over 
historys longest papacy confined 
Jews to Romes ghetto, condoned 
the church seizure of a Jewish-born 
boy and allegedly referred to Jews 
themselves as dogs.
The Israeli government itself 
expressed deep sorrow, especially 
in light of the progress John Pauls 
own 22-year papacy has made in 
Catholic-Jewish relations.
Pope John Paul acknowledged 
the rancor, calling Pius much 
loved, but also hated and slan
dered.
Beatifying a son of the church 
does not celebrate particular his
toric choices that he has made, but 
rather points him out for imitation 
and for veneration for his virtue, 
said John Paul, clad in bright green 
and gold for the ceremony.
An estimated 100,000-strong 
crowd of kerchiefed, banner-wav
ing pilgrims filled St. Peters Square 
in Rome to the colonnades for the 
beatifications, attended by blackclad leaders of Italys most staunch
ly Catholic noble families and polit
ical circles.
Hundreds of Romes Jews and 
Catholics protested the beatifica
tion in a candlelight vigil on its eve.
Elena Mortara, whose greatgreat uncle was taken from her 
Jewish family by Pius papal guards 
in 1858, called the beatification the 
reopening of a wound.
The church seized the 6-year-old 
Edgardo Mortara upon hearing a 
Catholic housemaid had secretly 
baptized him. Edgardo grew up to 
enter the priesthood under Pius
WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP)  A 
wild elephant killed one American 
tourist and injured another during 
a wildlife tour in a remote area in 
northwestern Namibia, officials 
said Monday.
Dean Hall was killed instantly 
and Dr. A. Said was hurt when a 
rare desert elephant charged a 
group of tourists trying to photo
graph it in the Huab River Valley on 
Saturday. No ages or hometowns 
for the men were immediately 
available.
Preliminary reports indicated the
patronage.
One frequently cited remark has 
Pius referring to Jews as dogs and 
declaring that of these dogs, there 
are too many of them present in 
Rome. Pius presided over what 
was Europes last enforced Jewish 
ghetto until the Nazi era.
Israels minister for Diaspora 
Affairs, Rabbi Michael Melchior, 
expressed deep sorrow Sunday 
conveying a tone of disappoint
ment repeatedly heard from Jews 
in the wake of the beatification.
Recalling John Pauls pilgrimage 
to Jerusalems Western Wall in 
March, Melchior said, as someone 
who saw the visit as a positive, his
torical turning point, I would 
expect the Vatican to show greater 
sensitivity toward the believers of 
other religions.
The New York-based AntiDefamation League called the 
beatification troubling.
Pius tumultuous 1846-1878 
papacy saw the violent breakup of 
the centuries-old papal states.
Noble-born Italians, of which he 
was one, gave him the name The 
Last King Pope. In contrast, 
Italians today still know the jovial, 
jowly, peasant-born John XXIII sim
ply as The Good Pope.
As the Vaticans envoy to Turkey 
during World War II, John is credit
ed with saving thousands of Jews 
with transit visas and other assis
tance  although at one point he 
complained of a convoy of Jews 
heading to Palestine and its holy 
sites.
John died of stomach cancer in 
1963 less than five years into his 
papacy. Weeks before his death, he 
issued the heartfelt Pacem in 
Terris (Peace on Earth) encyclical 
that set recognition of human 
rights as essential for world peace. 
Pius had condemned emerging civil 
rights in his own 1864 encyclical. 
Both popes presided over the
tourists had left their vehicle and 
walked between two groups of ele
phants from the same herd, said 
Ben Beytel, a senior official with 
the Ministry of Environment and 
Tourism.
Moving between the two groups 
could appear threatening to the 
desert elephants, a rare subspecies 
that has adapted to the arid condi
tions of the Namibian desert, he 
said.
Hall died within minutes of the 
attack and Said suffered a broken 
arm and a knee injury, said a medonly two Vatican councils of mod
ern times  Pius enshrining the 
dogma of papal infallibility, Johns 
ushering in 1960s liberalizations 
such as allowing Masses in local 
languages rather than Latin.
Divine design has willed the 
shared beatification of these two 
popes who lived in very different 
historical contexts, John Paul 
stressed Sunday.
Pope John remains in the mem
ory of all in the image of a smiling 
face and two arms thrown open in 
an embrace of the entire world, 
John Paul told pilgrims  many of 
whom had come from across Italy 
for Johns beatification in particu
lar.
Hes loved for his good will and 
his simplicity, said Lucrezia 
Gentile, who traveled from 
Calabria in southern Italy, where 
Catholics have been stringing rib
bons and banners days in advance 
of the beatification.
Pius IX lived in a very critical 
period, said another pilgrim in the 
square, Delfina Candi, defending 
Pius IX without being asked. It's 
not like today. Today it's easy.
John Paul beatified three others 
Sunday: Tommaso Reggio, a 19thcentury Italian bishop who found' 
ed the Congregation of the Sisters 
of St. Martha  and who strongly 
criticized Pius DCs ban on Catholic 
involvement in politics; GuillaumeJoseph Chaminade, a French priest 
who in 1800 founded the Marianist 
Family; and Joseph-Aloysius, an 
Irish monk who, as Columba 
Marmion, served as abbot of the 
Benedictine Maredsous Abbey in 
Belgium in the early 20th century.
Batification is the last formal 
step before possible sainthood.
John Paul has beatified and can
onized more people than all of his 
predecessors combined, believing 
firmly in presenting diverse role 
models for the worlds faithful.

ZAMBOANGA, Philippines 
(AP)  Muslim rebels who took 
an American man hostage in the 
southern Philippines did so after 
he angered them in an argument 
over religious issues at their jun
gle camp, a newspaper reported 
Sunday.
There was a scuffle, and sud

hostage, free-lance reporter 
Arlyn de la Cruz quoted a rebel as 
saying in the Philippine Daily 
Inquirer.
Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland, 
California, went to the camp vol

was held by the Abu Sayyaf 
rebels inside a bamboo hut 
guarded by 10 to 15 men when de 
la Cruz visited Friday.
His hands had been tied with 
electrical wire since Tuesday, 
when he damaged the door to the 
hut while shouting that he need
ed cleaning solution for his con
tact lenses, it said.
The Abu Sayyaf, which says 
i it is fighting for an independent 
Islamic state, is also holding six 
other Westerners and 12 
Filipinos on Jolo Island.
The group freed six hostages 
last week for a reported $6 mil

south as San Francisco, some 50 
miles away.
California Highway Patrol 
spokesman Mark Bunger, who has 
lived in Napa County his whole life, 
described the quake as by far the

Police probe 
theft of $2 
million violin
BOSTON (AP)  Police are cur
rently investigating the reported 
theft of a $2 million violin from an 
unlocked apartment closet.
A man called Boston police 
Thursday to report that his 
Stradivarius violin had been taken 
from his closet sometime in the last
teachers in March on neighboring 
Basilan Island.
Two of the teachers were behead
ed after the United States ignored 
the groups demand for the release 
of several Arab terrorists held in 
U.S. jails. The faction also tortured 
and killed a Catholic priest.
U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Cohen, plans to discuss Shillings 
abduction and cooperation in the 
fight against terrorism during a 
planned two-day visit to Manila 
starting Sept. 15, Philippine 
Defense Secretary Orlando 
Mercado said Sunday.
Cohen will meet President Joseph 
Estrada, Mercado and top military 
officials during the visit, which is 
part of a series of worldwide good
bye trips by top officials with the 
outgoing government of President 
Clinton.
The rebels demanded $10 million 
for Schillings release Thursday, 
then said Saturday that they would 
make political demands. The U.S. 
State Department has ruled out 
paying ransom.
Colombia rebel 
violence kills 35
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  A 
surge of rebel violence left 35 peo
ple dead over the weekend follow
ing President Bill Clintons visit' to 
Colombia, including seven police 
officers slain by guerrillas  some 
of whom were disguis.ed as police 
officers themselves.
In the latest attack, leftist guerril
las from the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, 
sneaked up on a police station 
Saturday in northern Colombia, 
officials said Sunday.
three months.
Boston Police spokesman Tom 
Sexton said Boston authorities are 
investigating. Its not an everyday 
occurrence that someone claims to 
have a $2 million musical instru
ment missing, Sexton said.
Dohoon Rhee, 26, told police he 
had last seen the violin in May of 
this year. He said he had been out 
of the country for more than a 
month and when he returned, the 
violin was gone.
Stradivarius violins are named 
for Antonio Stradivari, who made 
more than 1,100 of the instruments 
famed for their tone and power. 
Thousands of other violins bearing 
the Stradivarius name and copy
ing the original model have been 
made in tribute to Stradivari since 
his death in 1737.
Attempts to reach Rhee for com
ment on Saturday were unsuccess
ful. The phone number under 
which he had been listed had been 
disconnected.
The assault took the small town 
of Tomarrazon, Colombia by sur
prise, said National Police opera
tions director General Tobias 
Duran.
The guerrillas arrived in three 
trucks and a jeep, some dressed in 
camouflage and others as police. 
Rebels shot to death the four offi
cers posted at the station and 
ambushed reinforcements as they 
arrived, killing three more police
men, Duran added.
Nine officers survived the attack, 
in which rebels also destroyed the 
public telephone office in the town 
in Guajira State, which is about 475 
miles from the capital, Bogota. At 
least one FARC fighter died, police 
said.
Twenty-seven other people were 
killed in heavy overnight clashes 
that ended Saturday in western 
Colombia. Twelve of them were 
FARC rebels.
Seven airmen died when their 
US-built AC-46 gunship, which was 
sent to support ground troops, 
slammed into an Andean mountain 
peak.
At the mountaintop communica
tions complex they were protecting, 
eight soldiers died in fighting with 
guerrillas.
The rebels were unable to take 
the complex, which controls cellu
lar and other telephone links to 
much of western Colombia.
The FARC has stepped up attacks 
on rural police stations during the 
past two months, killing dozens of 
officers as well as civilians. At least 
231 police have died in the line of 
duty this year.
FARC attacks have continued 
nationwide despite peace talks 
which began with Pastrana in 
January 1999.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5. 2000
Vice President visits city 
on 27-hour campaign tour
works, streamers, and Van Halens Right Now. The large crowd cheered 
Gore as he worked the rope line and shook hands with local supporters. 
Gores Pittsburgh appearance was not his last of the day, as he headed to 
further destinations in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. Gores wife, Tipper, 
joined Senator Joe Liebermanns wife Hadassah at a union rally in Chicago 
yesterday afternoon.
I found the rally to be a really energizing event, especially considering 
that he is always portrayed as a bland speaker, said Tom Capasso, a senior 
electrical and computer engineering major.
Iwas surprised that there werent more people there. Im still undecid
ed as to Bush vs. Gore, but I was impressed today, said Kevin Davies, a 
senior electrical and computer engineering major.
Kamlet replaces Christiano as University Provost
Vice President Gore spoke to a large crowd of supporters in Pittsburgh while 
on a 27-hour tour of six different states.
KAMLET, from page 5 
science labs as one such upcom
ing project.
Kamlet added that, as provost, 
one of the fields that he will con
tinue to focus on is information 
systems (IS). It continues to be 
something that we put a lot of 
emphasis on, he said. [IS] is 
something that affects all parts of 
undergraduate education. He 
said that the University will do 
even more in the field of technol
ogy-enhanced learning in the 
future.
Kamlet has published over 50 
journal articles and has served on 
the U.S. Public Health Services 
Panel on Cost Effectiveness in 
Health and Medicine. He was 
also on a National Institutes of 
Health panel that focused on 
issues emerging from the Human 
Genome Project. Kamlet received 
his bachelors degree from 
Stanford University in mathe
matics, and his masters degree 
in economics and statistics and a 
doctorate in economics from the 
University of California at 
Berkeley.After serving as dean of the Heinz school since 1993, Mark Kamlet was named the University Provost last summer, 
replacing Paul Christiano. Kamlet says he will be placing increased emphasis on the humanities and arts programs 
at CMU. He also wants to increase the amount of learning done outside of the classroom.
Campus remembers progress made by LaPaglia
LAPAGLIA, from page 1 
cilly miss LaPaglias calm 
behavior, professionalism, and 
supervision as well his personal 
character. He was able to work 
well with everyone. He was the 
kind of person you could sit 
down and talk to on a personal 
level and a business level.
LPaglia worked as a patrol
man in Wilkins Township for 15 
years and was the police chief 
for the Forest Hills Borough for 
four y,ears before becoming 
chief of Carnegie Mellons 
police force in the late 1980s. 
He earned his bachelors 
degree in administration of jus
tice from the University of 
Pittsburgh in 1972 and received 
a masters degree in public 
management from the H. John 
Heinz III School of Public Policy 
and Management in 1991.
LaPaglia is survived by his 
wife, Gail, three sons, Adrian, 
Dorian and Justin, one daugh
ter, Camille Malecki, and one 
granddaughter.
Chief Jim LaPaglia passed away on Monday, August 21, after suffering from a heart attack. LaPaglia served on the 
CMU Police Force for 13 years, making great progress towards crime reduction and prevention that he will be long 
remembered for.
Police increase security 
because of serial rapist
RAPIST, from page 1 
feet tall, 200 pounds, and have 
short or shaven hair. The specific 
identity of the suspect remains 
uncertain at this point.
Raising awareness of these 
crimes is the best method for insur
ing safety, according to Sergeant 
William Ricci of the CMU police. To 
counter the threat, police have 
posted campus bulletins, provided 
preventative information during 
orientation, positioned visible 
patrols around campus, and pre
pared an escort service for stu
dents, he said.
The student body appears to 
remain confident of their on-campus safety. Sara Whitehead, a sec
ond year graduate student in public 
policy and management, said she 
feels fine about on-campus safety 
and the incidences have not 
prompted her to take any extra pre
cautions. The crime report fliers 
are noticeable, but Whitehead said 
she was uncertain of any other 
crime prevention efforts.
Because many of the police have 
been stationed within the 
University Center they are not 
immediately visible from outdoors. 
Efforts of campus police have not 
gone unnoticed or unappreciated. 
I feel really safe and have seen a lot 
of police around,said Meg Rothey, 
a first-year business major.
Locking doors and windows is an 
important safety precaution since 
the suspect entered each apart
ment complex through unlocked 
doors said Sergeant Ricci. Students 
should also use the school escort' 
service at night and call campus 
police whenever necessary at 
extension x8-2323 he said.
Im not too concerned because 
campus is usually pretty calm com
pared to the city, said Marika 
Haritos, a junior psychology and 
statistics major. Despite the quiet 
nature of campus, Sergeant Ricci 
said that this case is being taken 
very seriously and that authorities 
are doing everything to be proac
tive and bring this man to justice.
University welcomes Class of 2004
ORIENTATION, from page 5 
double major and Student Body 
President, spoke at this years 
Convocation. I was very excited 
to take part in this years 
Convocation ceremonies, said 
Fitzgerald. In addition to having 
the opportunity to extend a per
sonal welcome to the new class of 
2004, I presented the freshman 
class with their class tile. 
Hopefully, this tile will be passed 
through the hands of all the mem
bers of the class of 2004 until their 
graduation day, at which point it 
will be installed in the floor of 
Baker Hall with all of the other 
class tiles ranging from last years 
senior class back to CMlTs first 
graduating class nearly 100 years 
ago.
It has been a great start, said 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs. Orientation went well, 
the weather has been nice, and the 
class is as energetic and talented 
as ever.
Anne Witchner, the associate 
dean of Student Affairs, agreed 
with Murphy. Orientation defi
nitely had a greater sense of pride 
than ever before, said Witchner, 
who is responsible for coordinat
ing Orientation, supervising the 
head OCs, and first year programs.
This years orientation involved 
195 OCs. and 4 Head OCs. It is so 
exciting to be in such a supportive 
arid enthusiastic environment as 
the one that the OCs and Student 
Life staff create. There was a 
tremendous amount of energy for 
the duration of the week. At times, 
I think we even scared the first 
years with all our energy, said 
Diane Budzik, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major.
Some first-year students, how
ever, seemed to feel that 
Orientation was too busy and hec
tic. There was too much stuff to 
do during Orientation, said Kris 
Howard, a first-year chemical 
engineering major. When you get
to meet someone you should be 
given more time to meet them bet
ter.
Pat Moeller, a first-year physics 
major, agreed with Howards com
ments about the busy schedule. 
Playfair was scary. Since you 
would stay up at nights anything 
that was in the morning, you 
would not go to unless it was real
ly really interesting.
I thought it was easier to meet 
people in classes or on the floor, 
said Ken Mizuno, a first-year biol
ogy major.
It seems a lot of first-years are 
already thinking about applying to 
be OCs or RAs or to getting 
involved in other organizations. 
The activities fair next week 
should be especially good. It also 
seems to me that the upperclass 
students returned to campus espe
cially energized, so it has been a 
very fun start to the year. Perhaps 
that is the mark of our second cen
tury, said Murphy.
Senate decides what to do with surplus
SURPLUS, from page 1
least one student from each college, to review and 
evaluate the proposals. He said they will try to 
approve as many proposals as can be afforded, and 
then bring the suggestions to Student Government for 
a vote. He hopes to have the money spent by 
November 1.
I think Senate is doing exactly the right thing gath
ering student input before making any decisions, 
said Michael Murphy, dean of Student Affairs. This is 
an important opportunity, and the decision should be 
well-informed, he said.
Murphy explained that at a fiscal years end, orga
nizations surpluses and deficits usually offset each 
other. In general, the overall real deficit or surplus is 
rarely greater than 3 percent. Surpluses usually con
tribute to an operating reserve, which is kept over 6% 
but not more than 12 percent. For this reason, sur
pluses and deficits are generally not large enough to 
have an impact on spending since they either con
tribute or take away from the operating reserve. Since 
the operating reserve provides funds for Student 
Government to use in special circumstances, all of the 
money collected from the activities fee, a mandatory 
fee paid by all students enrolled in a degree granting 
program, can be allocated to student organizations 
each year.
Liber said he thought this years surplus of 
$123,600.11 was much larger than other years for 
several reasons. First, he said a number of organiza
tions simply did not spend their entire budgets. Liber 
suspected that organizations spent conservatively as 
a result of the problems associated with the 
Universitys transition to an Oracle-based accounting 
system. Due to complications, accounting sheets
could not be distributed to organizations so many of 
them were unaware of their financial situation.
In addition, Liber said that some large organiza
tions raised more money than they anticipated. While 
over $700,000 is distributed from the Activities Fee, 
over a million dollars is actually spent each year by 
student organizations due to supplemental fundrais
ing. Any surplus in an organizations budget at the 
years end is returned to Student Senate. For example, 
Spring Carnival returned a significant amount of 
money because they had a large income due to good 
weather, said Liber.
Murphy said that while organizations could have 
easily spent their surpluses before the years end, they 
acted responsibly by returning their unused money. 
Our reserves are solid, and capable management by 
students has turned back money they could have 
spent. It is a great opportunity now to take some of 
that money and do some good with it," said Murphy.
The magnitude of this surplus may cause some stu
dents to question whether last years increase in the 
activities fee from $65 to $68 per semester for infla
tion was actually necessary. After all, the numbers 
seem to indicate that spending has actually gone 
down. Liber said, however, that the previous year 
should be considered as an exception rather than a 
definite indicator of what is to come.
People have to realize that we have not had a bud
get surplus like this in recent years. This doesnt mean 
that well have one next year. This also doesnt mean 
that activities fee is too high or low, said Liber. 
People need to realize that money is there and they 
should spend it. People are fiscally conservative 
which is a good thing, but they also need to realize 
that money has no purpose sitting in a bank, he said.

CMU puts Newell, 
Simon papers online
The University Archives will now make the papers 
of computer scientist, Allen Newell, including his col
laborations with economist Herbert A. Simon, avail
able online. Access to the papers is being developed as 
the second phase of the Universitys digital archive 
project. The Newell and Simon collections include 
technical reports, lectures, teaching materials, and 
publication drafts. When the project is completed, it 
will include around 150,000 images. It began in the 
summer of 2000.
Allen Newell pioneered the study of artificial intel
ligence through designing computer architectures 
and programming languages to model human prob
lem solving behaviors. He worked in designing 
thinking machines such as a chess playing machine.
Herbert Simon applied scientific methods to the 
previously theoretical field of economics. His first
book called for the use of quantitative experiments in 
studying organizational decision-making.
NSF Awards $45 
million to PSC
The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) was 
recently awarded a three-year, $45 million grant 
from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to pro
vide high speed computing capability for researchers 
in science and engineering. The PSC will be collabo
rating with Compaq Computer Corporation in using 
the grant to create a new, powerful system for nation
wide use.
The PSC system will be the most powerful system 
to date and will be located in the Westinghouse 
Energy Center in Monroeville. It will focus on useful 
drug design, storm-scale weather forecasting, and 
earthquake modeling.

Activities Board rejuvenates 
entertainment on campus
The return to campus for the fall semes
ter is one that is not only met with work, 
but also play. The Activities Board (AB) has 
lined up an impressive list of events that 
will surely entertain and inform the com
munity, including big-name musical acts 
like Rusted Root and Blues Traveler, and 
speakers such as Ralph Nader and Mystery 
Science Theater 3000 writer Mike Nelson.
The news of the fall entertainment 
schedule is even more pleasing for return
ing students who endured the cancella
tions of acts such as George Clinton and 
Parliament Funkadelic, as well as Daily 
Show comedian Lewis Black last year. 
Many students expressed disappointment 
over the resulting lineup, which was 
unable to equal the turnout for some of the 
previous years' acts, like Soul Coughing 
and Norm MacDonald.
The improvement this semester is a 
result of ABs increased financial resources 
and knowledge. The organization has ben
efited from a significant increase in 
Student Senate funding for 2000-2001, 
nearly $50,000 greater than for 1999- 
2000. AB Lectures, AB Coffeehouse, and 
AB Concerts have received the greatest 
increases.
Even more importantly, the enhanced 
fall lineup is a result of more experience 
for the AB members who began their 
tenure at the beginning of fall 1999. With
a year under their belts, these committees 
have gained more familiarity with their 
jobs and have found more opportunities 
through additional contacts. For example, 
a possible collaboration between AB 
Coffeehouse and Pittsburghs Joker 
Productions could bring singer-songwriter 
Elliot Smith to campus in October. If this 
event materializes, ensuring successful 
future partnerships would benefit the 
organization and the CMU community.
Finally, the timing of the events gener
ate excitement by themselves. Fridays 
Rusted Root concert will serve as a wel
coming party for students. Holding the 
Blues Traveler concert during 
Homecoming weekend should reverse the 
usually low turnout of undergraduates to 
Homecoming events. Ralph Naders 
appearance during election season could 
stir a student body that is generally 
regarded as being apolitical.
But perhaps the best part of ABs sched
ule of events is that they are striving to 
make all the events free for students, 
including Fridays concert, which takes 
place outside on the CFA Lawn.
If AB can continue booking well-known 
acts and speakers, campus entertainment 
may have a bright future. Hopefully, CMU 
students can look forward to a headline 
band for this Spring Carnival thanks to 
these welcome improvements in AB.
Recent renovations improve 
living, but work still needed
Over the summer, several areas in 
Morewood Gardens, and Donner Hall 
underwent extensive reorganization. 
While the changes, which students been 
asking for, are certainly a welcome sight in 
these locations, they only begin to fix the 
overall problem facing residents of campus 
housing.
The changes in Morewood include mov
ing the Cyert Center for Early 
Development, formerly located in the 
buildings basement, to the recreation 
room near the main entrance. To accom
modate the move, the main TV room has 
become the new recreation room and the 
TV room is now in the first floor lounge in 
D-Tower.
Along with the changes to the room loca
tions, each area experienced significant 
upgrades to lighting and overall atmos
phere through varying degrees of renova
tion. The new recreation room received the 
most attention, with a brand new hard
wood floor and complementary light fix
tures, as well as two pool tables, a pingpong table, and an air hockey table.
A new feature in Morewood A and B tow
ers is a kitchen on each even-numbered 
floor. In addition, all dorm rooms in A and 
B Towers received new furniture. Housing 
Services has also made many of the same 
changes in the Donner basement that they 
did in the Morewood recreation room. 
These changes are a welcome service to the 
residents of these buildings. Certainly, the 
moving of the child development center to 
a more prominent location will be a great 
benefit to that organization. Previously, 
there was the question about whether the 
recreation room or the daycare centers ser
vices would be hurt by renovations.

Housing has successfully avoided this.
Housing Services should not forget, how
ever, that there are several residential areas 
besides Morewood and Donner that des
perately need similar work. The recreation 
room in West Wing, for example, could use 
at least the level of effort put into its coun
terparts in Morewood and Donner and the 
kitchen areas in West Wing and Resnik are 
passable at best. Several older dorms on 
the Hill still need renovations as well.
Additionally, the way housing check-in 
has been handled in recent years reflects 
unfavorably on Housing Services. In the 
past three years, the main check-in desk 
has moved from a tent outside Morewood 
to the old Morewood recreation room to 
the first floor of D Tower. As well as being 
difficult to locate, having a single check-in 
center adds difficulty to residents of build
ings on the other side of campus. 
Alternatives, such as area-specific check-in 
centers would be better suited to the 
demands of thousands of students that 
need to check in.
Another area that Housing Services still 
needs to improve upon is maintenance 
requests. The process has become more 
efficient through the use of online forms, 
but the response time is still inconsistent. 
The renovations to the fraternity quad have 
caused undue frustrations among many in 
the Greek community. The houses under
going construction are in bad shape and 
fixes have taken longer than originally 
promised.
Housing Services has done a good job of 
refitting recreation rooms in Morewood 
and Donner. The office should make sure 
that in the coming months it is just as atten
tive to other areas of campus housing.

Abortion debate rages on
Editor:
In the May 1 Tartan, Ken Tew wrote: 
 The fact that life begins at conception is 
a scientific one. I would challenge 
[Thaddeus Billman] to cite a single peerreviewed scientific journal that supports 
this claim.
I hate to rain on your parade, Mr. Tew, 
but I am willing to bet any amount of 
money that the DNA of any aborted fetus 
that came from a human womb will 
match your DNA, and my DNA, more 
closely than, say, that of a baboon.
Peer-reviewed scientific journal 
article or no peer-reviewed scientific
journal article, from this, I can prove 
that some abortions are, in fact, 
murder, using the standard definition 
of murder.
First, consider the fact that if every cell 
from some organism contains human 
DNA, then there's a pretty damn good 
chance that that organism should be clas
sified as homo sapiens, whether or not it 
is a fetus.
Second, the killing of any homo 
sapiens by another homo sapiens, 
barring a case of self-defense or 
manslaughter, is murder by definition. 
Therefore, in using the fetuss DNA 
in defining that fetus as a human, its 
killing by another human without 
some form of justification, (i.e. it was
Justin Suissa/Art Editor
an accident, or say, the mothers life was 
in jeopardy), is murder, QED.
If you are reading this (whether or not 
you are Ken), and you still don't under
stand my argument, then read it over, 
until you do fully understand what I have 
written.
Finally, if you still disagree with me, 
then offer some justification for your dis
proof, e.g. you don't think that ones 
humanity should be defined by their 
DNA. Otherwise, show some intestinal 
fortitude and say, Yes, I think that this 
form of murder should remain legal.

Man recognizes animal intelligence
Erin Lucas
Later this month, the Animal Social 
Complexity and Intelligence Conference 
will take place in Chicago. This marks the 
first time prominent scientists will meet 
to share findings and conduct a much 
needed cross-fertilization of research. 
This step by the scientific community to 
officially acknowledge the intelligence of 
animals comes as a large relief to animal 
lovers across the country.
As a fledgling animal activist myself, I 
too am thrilled with the news. At the 
same time, however, I cant help wonder
ing why it has taken until the year 2000 
for science to make an effort to formally 
recognize something mankind has known 
for centuries. In modern times alone we 
have seen dolphins navigate ships for peo
ple in times of crisis, dogs lay down their 
lives to protect their owners, and gorillas 
save and care for human babies. It is a sad 
commentary that it has taken this long for 
man to take the first small step in 
acknowledging the potential of-animals.
Since the beginning of humanity, we 
have been quick to evolve, especially in 
terms of technology, where advance
ments are made to increase the comfort 
and convenience of our lives. It seems 
natural that as man evolves, his sense of
ethics and spirituality would grow as 
well. However, it seems to me that 
mankind appears to be much slower to 
evolve in this sense, maybe even reluc
tant. Perhaps this can be attributed to the 
fact that practicing ethical treatment 
towards animals is contrary to the inher
ently self-serving nature of man.
This can be seen by the reluctance of 
science to recognize that animals are 
intelligent, because it is more convenient 
for us not to. It makes it easier for us to 
test on animals, for instance, even when 
many of the tests are worthless. Take the 
research of Robert L. Johnson, who, since 
1988, has been cutting into foxhounds 
and their puppies, removing 68 percent of 
their lungs, and forcing them to perform 
strenuous exercise with heavy masks 
placed over their faces. The dogs canine 
teeth are cut down to fit the masks, and 
the dogs are killed after the exercises are 
completed. This is reprehensible, espe
cially since the results being obtained are 
of no benefit to mankind. More compas
sionate scientists and researchers have 
publicly confirmed this fact. Although 
there are many more reliable alternatives 
to animal testing, such as human cell cul
tures, tissue cultures, human studies and 
computer programs, it has been deemed 
more profitable to torture animals 
instead. I cant help wondering whether a 
researcher who can carve up a helpless 
animal while it is conscious is some sort of 
pervert seeking an outlet for his cruelty.
The continuing practice of treating ani
mals as objects makes it easier for us. to 
breed them in warehouses where they 
live miserable existence^. After being 
deprived of all of their natural needs, 
becoming diseased and deformed from 
the horrid living conditions, they are 
slaughtered right in front of one another.
Animals have nobly served man since 
the beginning. They have provided us 
with protection, companionship, food, 
clothing and shelter, and we have greedi
ly accepted their sacrifice. The least we 
can do is acknowledge their lives, their 
sacrifices, and their feelings. Whether we 
like it or not, it is time to see that animals 
are highly intelligent and social, and can 
feel pain as acutely as we do. It may not be 
convenient for us to stop looking the 
other way, but that is the entire point. 
Sometimes the right thing to do is not 
always the easiest; in fact, it rarely is.
Gandhi once said, The greatness of a 
nation can be judged by the way its ani
mals are treated. Using this standard, no 
country on the planet deserves the dis
tinction of greatness. The United States is 
a world leader; we should start acting like 
it. This conference is a step in the right 
direction, but it is horribly overdue and 
simply not enough.

Smoking rebellion leads to enlightenment
Sean Mintus
For those of you who have yet to meet 
me personally, allow me to tell you a little 
about myself. Im the kind of guy who 
likes to live life on the edge. Im the kind 
of guy who looks danger right in the 
eye and says, You dont scare me. Youre 
my middle name. Among my circle 
of friends, Im known as the rogue, the 
risk taker, the outlaw. I dont wear a seat
belt, I dont press the button before cross
ing Morewood, and on occasion, I 
outright refuse to wash behind my ears. 
Ive even been known to pick up a piece 
of food and eat it after it has fallen on 
the floor.
However, recently, I felt as though my 
bad guy image needed a bit of a tune 
up. It seemed I wasnt getting the kind of 
respect I deserved. After all, it is docu
mented fact that I have gone swimming a 
mere ten minutes after eating, and pro
ceeded to exit the pool and run around it 
with scissors.
But seriously, nobody seemed 
impressed anymore. Thus, it was time for 
me to add some new, intimidating, really 
scary facet to this lawless renegade visage 
I had built.
First, I tried not tying my shoelaces. 
My mother always yelled whenever 
my shoelaces werent tied up tight. 
She said that one day I would fall 
down and break my nose. What better 
way to emphasize my rebellious 
nature than to oppose what my 
parents had sanctioned throughout 
my adolescence?
So after getting out of intensive 
care, I decided that a better course of 
action would be to stop bathing. 
However, after less than a week of 
this, my roommate saw fit to light my 
wardrobe on fire and douse the ashes 
with holy water, all the while danc
ing around the pyre and screaming
the power of Christ compels you! 
The power of Christ compels you! 
It seemed time for something drastic. 
So I started smoking.
Initially, I intended for this only to 
be an occasional thing. Whenever a 
cute girl walked by (every six months 
or so), Id quickly light up 3 ciga
rette, take a big old drag, lean back, 
and flash her a beaming, toothless 
(due to the shoelace mishap) grin. 
She would then take one look at the 
flaming stick in my hand, the smoke 
billowing out from within my 
manly, heaving lungs, forget about 
the crooked nose, and fall deeply in 
love with me. Yes, this all made sense 
at one time.
The problem is, smoking turned 
out to be a lot harder than one might 
think. Honestly, who would have 
suspected that igniting a paper roll 
full of heinous toxins three inches 
from your face, inhaling whatever 
infectious gases came from the fire,

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5. 20007Tires threaten drivers safety in US, Venezuela
Damian Olesnycky
The Bridgestone Corporation and Ford 
Motor Company are facing mounting pressure 
and intense scrutiny due to their three-weekold recall of 6.5 million of Bridgestones 
Firestone brand tires in the US. Bridgestone, 
the Japanese parent company of Firestone 
Tire & Rubber Company, is the 
worlds largest tire manufac
turer, with Ford serving as its 
biggest customer. Bridgestone 
and Fords tire recall in the US, 
the second largest in US histo
ry, is the second of two similar 
but separate recalls this year, 
and the corporations are currendy dealing with the conse
quences of both. Both recalls 
involve treads separating from 
the tires of many Ford 
Explorer SUV vehicles, caus, ing treacherous rollovers that 
have often resulted in serious 
injury and death.
In addition to scrambling to 
find and produce millions of 
replacement tires as quickly as 
possible, the companies are 
also preparing to testify before 
Congress on September 6, 
cooperate with federal safety 
officials ongoing investiga
tions and warnings, defend 
themselves in a Florida classaction lawsuit, deal with a 
potentially crippling labor 
union strike, and face criminal 
charges from the Venezuelan 
government. Amid the turmoil, the two com
panies have repeatedly accused one anothers 
products of being responsible for the accidents 
that have caused at least 88 deas and 250 
injuries in the US as well as 46 deaths in 
Venezuela, simply adding to the public rela
tions black eye that each has already suffered. 
One indication that the companies have suf
fered in the publics perception is a CNN poll 
that revealed that 68 percent of those who 
participated would not buy a Ford Explorer 
with Firestone tires even if the tires were not 
involved in the recall. Both companies are 
feeling the financial repercussions of the dis
asters as well, with Bridgestones shares floun
dering at a five-year low and Fords shares 
dropping to a 52-week low.
The first recall took place in Venezuela dur
ing the month of May 2000. The Venezuelan 
government, however, insists that action 
should have been taken much sooner because 
of 1998 reports of Firestone blowouts causing 
Ford Explorers to roll over. Venezuelan con
sumer authorities allege that the reports led to 
a series of secret meetings between 
Bridgestone and Ford, in which the companies 
decided to add a fifth ply to the tire model 
rather than issuing an expensive recall. This 
past week, Firestone officials confirmed that 
meetings took place with Ford Venezuela in 
which redesigns were discussed, but that such
beled Firestone tires. This past Thursday, the 
Venezuelan consumer authorities recom
mended that the federal prosecutor to file 
criminal charges against the two companies 
for not taking action sooner.
The second recall, currently taking place in 
the US, was announced on August 9. 
However, signs that something was wrong 
began as far back as a few years ago when the 
State Farm insurance agency began contact
ing Firestone about similar accidents involving 
the failure of their tires. State Farm claims that 
Firestone was very unresponsive to the con
tact, and no action was taken by the tire manTeresa S. Mazzotta/Special to The Tartan
talks were normal. The tires produced after 
the aforementioned meetings, however, were 
labeled that they contained five plies when 
most of them contained four or less. Firestone 
admitted the mislabeling, but asserted that 
the tires produced met Fords specifications. 
Despite Firestones claims, Ford engineers 
found that the treads of the new tires separat
ed at a rate 500 times worse than those manu
factured in the United States. Shortly after, 
Ford advised Bridgestone to issue a recall for 
all of the mislabeled tires. Bridgestone did not 
take any serious action until the spring of 
2000, when they announced that they would 
not issue a recall. The announcement came 
because of pressure from Ford, who then 
recalled all of their Explorers with the mislaufacturer. The first major event leading up to 
the recall took place on August 3, when feder
al safety officials opened an investigation of 
Firestone after receiving 193 complaints (21 
involving fatalities) about the tires. The fol
lowing day, Sears, a major tire retailer, said 
that it stopped selling the tire models. Five 
days later, Bridgestone announced the recall 
of 6.5 million tires, jamming Firestone retail 
locations across the US and causing the 
Firestone website to crash. In the days follow
ing the announcement, customers voiced their 
frustration at an inadequate supply of replace
ment tires, spurring Ford to replace the 
recalled tires with othir brands if Firestone 
replacements were not available. On August 
14, South Florida families filed a class-action
lawsuit against Firestone, seeking immediate 
replacement of the recalled tires. The chaos 
continued for weeks without adequate 
replacements, with Bridgestone chartering 
Boeing 747 airplanes to bring more tires from 
Japan and reimbursing customers with cash 
for recalled tires, while Ford halted produc
tion at three truck assembly plants in order to 
free up 70,000 additional tires for the recall. 
The situation grew even worse when 8,000 
workers at 9 Firestone plants, represented by 
the United Steelworkers of America labor 
union, threatened to walk out at 12:01 am 
September 2 until they signed a new contract 
(the last contracts expired in 
April). Such a strike could deci
mate the reeling company 
because of the setback it would 
cause in the recall effort, so 
Bridgestone/Firestone officials 
and the USWA have engaged in 
round-the-clock efforts to 
resolve the problem. The federal 
government continued its full 
court press on the two compa
nies at the end of August and 
beginning of September. On 
August 28, Congress said that it 
would hold hearings in which 
officials from Bridgestone and 
Ford would have to testify. On 
September 1, federal safety offi
cials issued a consumer warning 
to consider replacing an addi
tional 1.4 million Firestone tires 
on top of the 6.5 million 
involved in the recall.
As the dismal situation enters 
September with legal, corpo
rate, and labor problems that 
could prove stifling to 
Bridgestone and Fords safety 
efforts, the search for account
ability carries on. In spite of the 
significant efforts that both com
panies are putting forth in the face of this 
heavy adversity, the facts continue to indicate 
that they did not act quickly enough in the 
Venezuela and US recalls. A large portion of 
the accidents could have been prevented if 
action had been taken sooner, especially in the 
Venezuela recall. The companies should be 
stringently punished for their slow assessment 
of the danger involved in both situations on 
top of their manufacturing mistakes.
With the CEOs of Bridgestone and Ford 
appearing before Congress on September 6, 
the world will know soon enough why this 
tragic, frantic search for tires took place.

Novice smoker shares newfound wisdom with CMUs campus
From SMOKING, page 6
and pretending that you not only tolerated, but 
actually enjoyed doing so would be this hard?
Truth be told, I managed to screw up more 
frequently than the CMU Housing office. Thus, I 
submit to all ofyou current and would-be smokers 
a few helpful hints. I do not do this, of course, 
for my own gain. I do it so that one day, perhaps 
one of the 11 people who read this column will 
say that their life was saved by my sagacious words, 
and that said person will be an independently 
wealthy, beautiful, blonde nymphomaniac 
named Kitty who has a thing for guys with 
crooked noses.
Rule # 1: While lighting the cigarette, do not maneuver 
it so that it is perpendicular to the ground. This causes, 
when you strike the lighter, your nose hairs to be 
burned. I know that cigarette smoke, as far as scents go, is 
somewhere between dog feces and week-old egg 
salad in the Sahara, but trust me when I say that 
you do not want to smell burning nose' hair. 
Especially because you have no choice but to do so  its in 
your nose.
Rule # 2: While lighting a cigarette, minimize the time 
burnt reaching into your pocket and getting the lighter. 
You see, the longer a cigarette is held in between your 
lips, the more it adheres to the viscous fluids naturally 
produced by your mouth! If too much time passes, the. 
cigarette bonds fairly well to both lips, so after lighting 
it, when you go to pull it out of your mouth, your 
fingers simply slide down the shaft, pausing just long 
enough at the end to be horribly burnt. If youre really 
lucky, this causes you to scream any number of 
obscenities, resulting in the subsequent spitting out of 
the cigarette, which will, without fail, land directly in 
your lap.
Rule # 3: Smoking really isnt that cool. If a girl or a 
guy sees smoke emanating from any, let alone three 
of your facial orifices, they are actually less inclined 
to talk to you. This is why dragons are so rarely 
seen in public. If you need to smoke, do so in a 
private or poorly lit area, away from the prying eyes 
of society and your father. Furthermore, dont light 
a cigarette in front of anyone, especially someone 
whose opinion of you is valued in any way. 
Nothing good can come of it. Reread rules one and two
if you doubt me.
Rule # 4: If, perchance, you burn yourself while 
smoking, dont get discouraged. Dont wrap the 
burns in highly flammable gauze either. This one 
is self-explanatory.
Rule # 5: Dont try to type while smoking a cigarette. 
This wasnt one of my original rules, but I discovered it 
about thirty seconds ago.
So those are the rules. Im not trying to tell smokers to 
stop smoking or non-smokers not to start. Quite frankly, I 
dont care. In fact, as of now, I am officially endorsing 
smoking. Given the recent rise in anti-smoking ads on 
TV and the ridiculous amount of television that I know 
you all watch, nothing I say in favor of smoking will 
stand a chance of offsetting what has already been 
pumped into your heads. So kick back, relax, light up a can
cer stick, and enjoy. Oops....
Rule # 6: Remain in an upright position at all times when 
smoking.

major. I bet you feel stupid for having taken a few minutes out of

MLB pennant races: the picks are recastTartans defeat PittGreensburg handily
SOCCER, from page 12
for a tackle from behind on
Leonhard. Leonhard came up
limping, but remained in the
game.
Just moments after the card was 
issued, the Bobcats hard play cost 
them dearly as CMU was awarded 
a penalty kick for a tackle inside 
the box. Tepper calmly stepped up 
to the penalty spot and drilled his 
shot into the bottom-right corner 
of the goal for his second score of 
the game.
The Bobcats finally produced 
another offensive run with just 
under five minutes remaining in 
the first half, but junior goalkeep
er Tom Dougherty watched the 
cross roll harmlessly across the 
goal mouth and across the end 
line for a goal kick.
The Tartans had one last, 
chance to pad their lead when 
Zupon sent Arbuckle down the 
right sideline with a through ball, 
but Crummy couldnt handle the 
cross and the half ended with 
CMU leading 2-0.
Though only leading by two at 
the. half, the Tartans controlled 
the rhythm of play and the only 
question remaining was whether 
Tepper would earn his third goal 
to complete the hat trick.
He would have to wait for his 
chances, though, as Hibshman 
opened the second half scoring 
with a left-footed blast from 25 
yards out after just two minutes.
After Hibshman was denied a 
second goal within three minutes 
by an acrobatic save from the 
Bobcats keeper, the Tartans sur
vived a scare when Dougherty had 
a clearance attempt blocked and 
watched the ball cross the goal 
mouth twice before the Tartans 
defense recovered and cleared the 
threat.
The remainder of the game 
was more of the same as 
Carnegie Mellon racked up 20 
shots (nine on goal) while allow
ing just two. For Dougherty, most 
of the action came from clearing
crosses off his line as he was 
forced to make just one save to 
earn the shutout.
The big story of the second half 
was the referees efforts to keep 
the still-escalating physical play 
from getting out of hand. By the 
end of the game, Greensburg play
ers were tagged for two more yel
low cards for hard tackles and one 
for a verbal confrontation with the 
referee.
For their part, the Tartans 
played hard but clean, though 
first-year forward Eric Buhman 
was issued CMUs lone yellow for 
a tackle from behind late in the 
first half.
While the Tartans earned 
numerous chances against a 
porous Bobcat defense, the 
offense showed a bit of inexperi
ence in their finishing ability 
throughout the second half. 
Almost all of the Tartans second 
half shots were off-target until 
Tepper ripped his third goal of the 
game from 30 yards out to set the 
final score at 4-0.
Head coach Nick Gaudioso was 
encouraged by the result, but 
admitted that the team needs to 
mature a bit more before begin
ning play in the always rough 
University Athletic Association 
conference.
We had a fair performance, 
said Gaudioso. But we have so 
many young kids who start, we 
need a lot of work.
Contributing to the problem 
was the success of last years team, 
which qualified for the East Coast 
Athletic Conference playoffs with 
a roster dominated by upperclass
men.
Since last years team was so 
strong, the young guys didnt have 
much of a chance to play, said 
Gaudioso.
The Tartans next game is 
Wednesday, September 6 at 
home against Waynesburg 
College, and they will play their 
first away game at Mount Union

.slide a bit, but, though they arent 
playing great, the Chisox, like the 
i Yankees, are doing just enough to 
keep their lead through the end of 
(the season.
My other big hope for a little 
redemption is that the 
Diamondbacks can^ regroup in the 
/ NL West. Dusty Baker has the 
Giants playing their usual solid 
ball, but this time around, Arizona 
jj hasnt been getting the offensive 
production to keep up. Randy 
; Johnson has looked almost mortal 
in his past few starts, and even the 
acquisition of Curt Schilling from
I the Phillies at the-trade deadline 
hasnt turned things around.
That just leaves the AL West and 
NL Central, and I have to honestly 
say; I have absolutely no idea whats 
going on with either one of these 
divisions. I knew St. Louis and 
Seattle (the current leaders) would 
be good, and that Cincinnati and 
Ojakland (second place) wouldnt 
qjiite be in contention, but where 
are Houston and Texas (my picks)? 
Both teams, virtually unchanged 
from the division winning teams of 
last year, have dropped completely 
off the face of the earth. Even play
ing in the launching pad that is 
Enron Field, the Astros are fighting 
the Pirates to stay out of last place
Reagan Heller/Art Staff
havent shown the ability to rally 
when it really counts.
Todd Helton wont hit .400 and 
Carlos Delgado wont win the AL 
Triple Crown, though Delgado will 
be the closer of the two to his respec
tive goal. As of Monday, Heltons 
average stood at .390, with the 
majority of his remaining games 
away from the thin air of Coors 
Field. If that doesnt get to him, the 
media pressure will. No new Ted 
Williams this year.
Since the .400 mark wont happen,
Id love to see Delgado win the Triple 
Crown, and hes got a shot. Currently 
leading the league in home runs and 
trailing Edgar Martinez by single 
digits in the RBI race, Delgados 
stumbling block will be batting aver
age. Seven points of average is a 
large gap to make up when youre 
chasing a hitter as good as Nomar 
Garciaparra. Look for Delgado to get 
two-thirds of the way there.
Thats all I care to take chances on 
right now, so if youll excuse me, I 
have to go build a shrine to Abner 
Doubleday and pray that I get at 
least one of these picks.
Matt Brun is a junior ECE major j 
who really hopes those bad picks \ 
werent his fault, as that would bode i 
very poorly for his chances in his 
upcoming fantasy football league.

the way theyve been playing 
recently? Now that there is finally 
some stability to the Indians rota

the Indians are 27-19 since the AllStar break and 10-5 in their last 15.

only scoreboard watching Texas is 
doing is trying to stay ahead of 
Tampa Bay to avoid finishing with 
the worst record in the AL.
Okay, now that Ive talked 
through how everything went so 
horribly wrong for me through this 
part of the season, I think Im ready 
to try again. And so, without fur
ther ado (but maybe a bit more 
trepidation), here are my not-sofearless predictions for the remain
ing month of the season.
The Indians will win the AL Wild 
Card. I know youre all thinking this 
is just a biased pick, and while I 
make no secret of the fact that I am
one caveat here, though. If there is 
a tie and playoff for the Wild Card, 
Martinez will give the Red Sox the 
playoff berth.
In the NL East, the Mets will blow 
it again and settle for the Wild Card, 
while Arizona wont catch San 
Francisco. The Mets finish their 
schedule with six games against the 
Braves in the final two weeks for the 
second consecutive year. For the 
second consecutive year, those 
games will be the difference as 
Atlanta forcibly holds onto its divi
sion crown. As for the West, the 
Giants have been too consistent all 
year to slide now and the Dbacks

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5. 2000il
Tartans display fresh talent with 20-7 
win in regular season opener at Denison
by Brad Grantz
Business Editor
The company advertises longlasting freshness with its signature 
chewing gum product, Big Red. 
However, by the fourth quarter of 
Saturdays Carnegie MellonDenison football game, the Big Red 
of Denison were physically unable 
to continue as the Tartans outmuscled them in a 20-7 victory.
Carnegie Mellon opened its 2000 
campaign with a plethora of new 
faces to the offense and defense, 
returning only seven starters from 
last years bowl victory squad.
Denison lost a mere seven total 
from its 1999 team, one that played 
the role of the loser here at Gesling 
Stadium, 31-13.
Denison may have been search
ing for revenge, but were no match 
for the Tartans, who were simply 
athletically superior.
In front of a crowd of about 700, 
CMU endured one lightning delay 
of 40 minutes early in the first 
quarter to dominate Denison in 
greater fashion than the score indi
cates.
Carnegie Mellon had difficulty in 
the red zone, as first-year placekicker Mike Palmer missed field 
goals from 34 and 22 yards.

the Tartans 2000 team appeared in 
its special teams. The kickoff return 
unit averaged a subpar 11.5 yards 
per return and Palmer also missed 
an extra point.
At 9:56 in the first quarter, a 
lightning storm stopped the 
Tartans in their tracks. Following 
the 40 minute delay, CMU was 
unable to continue its promising 
opening drive.
After a Denison punt, junior 
quarterback Eric Zimpfer connect
ed with senior wide out Mike
Mike Monsilovich. CMU utilized a 
running back-by-committee 
approach to gain 290 yards on the 
dirt.
With Chris Rose sitting out due 
to an ankle injury, seven backs 
were used to consistently pound 
the ball. First-year Ricardo Clarke 
shone brightest, gaining 60 yards 
on a mere eight carries. Clarke was 
the workhorse for the final two 
scoring drives in the fourth quar
ter.
In the second frame, Denison
Carnegie Mellon endured one lightning 
delay of forty minutes early in the first 
quarter to dominate Denison in greater 
fashion than the score indicates.

to put Carnegie Mellon on the 
board.
McLaughlin finished the day 
with two catches for 124 yards, 
while Zimpfer was 3 for 8 for 134 
yards, one touchdown and inter
ception apiece, through the air.
CMU used its gritty, rough and 
tumble wing T offense to controi 
the clock and wear down the Big 
Red defense. Last year, the Tartans 
featured two outstanding senior 
running backs in Mike Campie and
relied on the arm of Greg Nuendorf 
to rally the troops. Capitalizing on 
CMUs first half missed scoring 
opportunities, Denison was able to 
take a 7-7 tie into halftime follow
ing a Tommy Waggoner six yard 
touchdown catch.
In last years CMU routing of 
Denison, Neuendorf lasted a mere 
quarter and a half before being 
knocked out of the game with a 
season-ending head injury by line
backer Todd Connollys hit.

attempts for nearly 200 yards.
In order to play competively, 
Denison tried to avoid the CMU 
run defense and exploit first year 
cornerback Jeff Kleinfelter. 
However, after shaky play early, 
Kleinfelter held his ground along 
with the rest of the CMU sec
ondary, led by senior safety Jared 
Winchester.
The CMU defense held Denison 
to a paltry 10 yards rushing on 18 
attempts.
However, Neuendorf was sacked 
several times late in the game as 
Denison fitfully tried to recover, by 
senior defensive tackle Mark 
Reiner and junior inside linebacker 
Mike Hubbert.
Early in the fourth quarter after a 
terrible Denison punt, Ricardo 
Clarke rushed his way to the goal 
line. Sophomore fullback Adam 
Urbanczyk punched it in from the 1 
yard line. Urbanczyk finished with
8 carries totaling 22 yards. Five 
minutes later, he smashed in from 
the 1 for his second touchdown to 
finish the-scoring and any hopes 
that Denison had to reek revenge 
on the 2000 Tartan squad.
The Tartans suit up again on 
Saturday at Case Western Reserve 
University, and again the Saturday 
afterwards against Bethany College 
for the first home game of the 2000 
season.

September 5> 2000 THE TARTAN Page 12
Toronto gave me a brief scare 
when they grabbed the division 
lead back in June, but has pre
dictably slid well back into the Wild 
Card race. Ditto the Red Sox, who 
are still relying on Pedro Martinez 
to keep them afloat.
(Another side note here. The 
whole Carl Everett scenario was the 
most pathetic thing Ive ever seen. 
He was a good eight inches outside 
the batters box and had the gall to 
get upset at the umpire who finally 
called him on it. At least he had the 
sense not to appeal his suspension 
for head butting said umpire. If he 
had, I wish commissioner Bud Selig 
would have extended his sentence 
rather than shortened it.)
Sticking with the theme of my 
limited successes, I look to the 
faithful National League East. Yes, I 
realize that the Mets caught up to 
and passed the Braves last week, 
but their lead is only one game. 
Plus, if I recall my prediction article 
correctly, I gave the Mets the best 
chance at an upset and at least the 
Wild Card. Well, whoever loses this 
one gets the Wild Card, so Im look
ing pretty good either way.
Unfortunately, thats about all I 
can say about what went right for 
me this summer. Giving myself par
tial credit for the Mets-Braves race, 
Im looking at a current success rate 
of 1.5 out of six. Not too good.
Moving on to the AL Central, I 
feel I should be allowed to take a 
mulligan on this pick. How could 
anyone possibly have been expect
ed to account for roughly threefourths of the Indians pitching staff 
going on the disabled list at one 
time or another over the course of 
the season? True, they did over
come numerous injuries to win the 
division last year, but those injuries 
were all to position players, an area 
where Cleveland was deep enough 
to practically field two all-star 
teams. Frankly, Im astounded that 
a team that has already used 30+ 
pitchers this season could be above 
.500, much less be leading the Wild 
Card race.
The White Sox were another sur
prise in just how much they 
improved from last year. 
Admittedly, I did say they had a 
chance to be this years 99 Reds, 
but I didnt really expect it to hap
pen. Even more surprising, I think, 
has been their staying power. With, 
a 10.5 game lead at the All-Star 
break, one would expect a young, 
relatively inexperienced team to

another shot until senior midfield

teams began to pick up numerous

escalated as the game went on,

Sports ShortsWomens soccer loses to Hopkins
In the womens soccer game of 
the season on Sunday, Johns 
Hopkins University rode a single 
early second-period goal all the 
way to the finish, defeating 
Carnegie Mellon in a 1-0 
shutout.
The Tartans start off their sea
son 0-1, and end up losing with
out scoring to JHU for the second 
time in two matchups. When the 
two teams played last season, the 
Blue Jays came out on top, 2-0.
Although Tartan goalie jMaya 
Nigrosh made twice as jmany 
saves as the Blue Jay goalie, 
Shannon OMalley, it was due to 
the fact that Johns Hopkins took
13 shots on goal, compared to 
Carnegie Mellons meager five.
The womens soccer team 
(1-0) has its next game on 
Wednesday, at Allegheny College 
at 4 pm. Then, the Tartans will 
face Mount Union College on 
Saturday, September 9, at Mt. 
Union.

A Tartan loss in the semifinals 
to Sienna Heights ended the 
string of three consecutive wins

Baseball preps for new season
The Club Baseball team just 
started practicing this past week, 
and has its first game on 
Wednesday, against Penn StateNew Kensington.
The team is looking for its level 
of play to continue climbing, as it 
was doing at the end of the spring 
season. For now, though, Coach 
Rich Greiser just wants to get 
back in the flow of things.
Were going to be ready to 
play Wednesday  were not 
going to be as ready as we want to 
be, but were going to play, said 
Greiser.
One positive that Greiser sees 
is that a large portion of the expe
rienced team members have 
returned to play. A lot of the vet
erans are back, said Greiser. Its 
very encouraging.

past Saturday morning.
On the womens side, Carnegie 
Mellon finished in third place 
behind Baldwin Wallace (23

A View From The Bleachers
by Matt Brun
Maybe I should just give up now. 
Its become perfectly clear to me 
that I have no clue what Im talking 
about in these columns. I mean, 
how can I deal with the fact that 
only one of my preseason picks for 
the division winners is currently 
leading its division? But then, Im 
not the only one. I can at least take 
comfort in the fact that every other 
so-called expert is just as con
fused as I am.
All summer Ive been watching 
my picks struggle to remain in con
tention, trying to reason out just 
where I went wrong. Some of the 
madness I can understand, most of 
it I dont, but its all made for an 
interesting summer and what 
should be one hell of a finish.
For prides sake, lets start with 
where I went right  the American 
League East. I nailed this one. The 
Yankees havent been playing even 
close to their own lofty standards, 
but theyve done just enough to stay 
well clear of the Red Sox and Blue 
Jays. (A quick side note. I think 
watching Chuck Knoblauch try to 
throw the ball to first base was the 
funniest thing I saw all summer.)
The madness 
has made for an 
interesting summer 
and what should 
be one hell of a 
finish.
National tennis champ looks to seize an opportunity
by Krissy Choi
Staffwriter
At the close of the athletic sea
son this past May, Kayvon 
Fatahalian took over the NCAA 
Division III Mens Tennis National 
Singles Championship with a 6-3, 
6-4 win over Sloan Rush of Trinity 
University, and earned Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys first national 
championship title in any sport. 
He was the first Tartan to compete 
in the national tournament since 
Andrew Lee in the 1990-91 season.
Fatahalian compiled a 30-3 sin
gles record in the 2000 season. He 
was sixth going into the tounament among the top thirty-two 
competitors in the NCAA East 
Region.
Fatahalian, a computer science 
major, became the second fresh
man ever in the history of NCAA to 
have captured the Division III
mens singles title this past 2000 
season. Donovan Jones of 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College 
in California claimed the title as a 
freshman in 1981. Even Fatahlian 
himself was impressed.
I didn't even know at the time, 
said Fatahalian. I learned over the 
summer and was 
kind of sur
prised.
The Tartans 
first singles play
er actually took 
some time away 
from tennis over 
the summer after 
the big win.
Despite making 
history at CMU,
Fatahalian does not see the nation
al title as a factor of significant 
transition in his life and in the 
overall outlook of his tennis career.
It doesnt change anything. It 
doesnt make it a bigger of a deal or
less of a deal. I look at it the same 
way," says Fatahalian.
Fatahalian started his tennis 
career at the age of six and has 
been playing competitively ever 
since the age of twelve. Having 
chosen tennis over soccer, 
Fatahalian said he likes the athleti
cism of the sport. At Carnegie 
Mellon, he typically practices three 
hours a day, five days a week.
According to Fatahalian, he 
enjoys training more than compet
ing. Its an individual sport, h6
says. You dont have to worry 
about other players. Its all up to 
you, says Fatahalian.
Though Fatahalian clearly likes 
the individuality of the sport, 
Coach Peter Moss sees Kayvon as 
an energetic team player as well. 
According to Moss, Fatahalian 
set a standard, and 
as a result, he has 
seen change in the 
other'players.
He helps out the 
guys and sets a 
good example, 
said Moss. As a 
result of this cham
pionship, Moss 
says that the team 
is working harder, 
practicing harder and becoming fit.
His leadership is very positive 
[to the other players], said Moss. 
 I am very impressed with his ath
letic and scholastic abilities.
Moss is still the more impressed
that Fatahalian would still like to 
improve his skills in tennis.
As a returning player, Fatahalian 
wants to defend his championship. 
He plans on approaching the 
upcoming season exactly the same 
way as he did previously, but he 
does feel pressure to prove to 
myself that it wasn't a fluke.
According to Moss, there are 
many more people who want to 
compete against Fatahalian now 
that he has reached such a high 
level. However, Fatahalian seems 
to feel a bit awkward fitting into 
his title.
I feel comfortable being an 
underdog, says Fatahalian.
To play with his new label and to 
match his past results will be a 
challenge this season, but 
Fatahalian maintains a confident 
approach and is getting ready to 
prove that he can indeed meet the 
expectations now placed upon him 
by last seasons successes.
Fatahalian plans on approaching the 
upcoming season exactly the same 
way as he did previously, but he does 
feel pressure to prove to myself that it 
wasnt a fluke.
Tartans pummel Greensburg in first mens contest
by Matt Brun
Special Projects Manager
On a  typically unpleasant 
Pittsburgh evening, the Carnegie 
Mellon mens soccer team debuted 
a young, inexperienced roster at 
home last Friday.
On this night, however, the high 
humidity and swarms of insects 
that invaded Gesling Stadium may 
have proved to be more formidable 
opponents than the visiting 
University of Pittsburgh at 
Greensburg Bobcats.
The Bobcats opened the game 
with a quick rush off the opening 
kick-off but shot high over the 
crossbar.
From that point on, however, the 
Tartans dominated, as the Bobcats

Miller Gallery opens Fusion! exhibit
by Sara Stille
News Editor
The Regina Gouger Miller 
Gallery is now bringing technolo
gy and art together with 
Fusion! The exhibit, which is 
open until September 29, fea
tures over 20 artists and is orga
nized by the STUDIO for Creative 
Inquiry and Robert Atkins, a 
Microsoft Research Fellow. The 
exhibit offers an amazing combi
nation of scientific research and 
artistic expression that one rarely 
finds.
One of the appealing qualities 
of the Fusion! show is its diversi
ty and variety of exhibits. Few 
generalizations can be made
progress. It combines data from 
NASA missions, Java 3D, Java 
Swing and other Internet tech
nologies.
Another interesting mix 
between science and art is made 
in Gray Matters: The Brain 
Movie. The displayed section is 
an interactive puzzle, which is a 
segment of the movie produced 
by the STUDIO for Creative 
Inquiry. It seeks to imitate the 
manner in which neurons in the 
brain form visual information 
from sound and visual cues. Its 
intended to be a portrait of the 
inside of the brain at work.
One of the more humorous dis
plays is called Scratch. This 
work of George Roland was made 
in 1996 and is an interactive,
Highly collaborative processes and 
mult-disciplinary methods
about the stunningly diverse 
array of works in this show - only 
about the highly collaborative 
processes and multi-disciplinary 
methods that resulted in their 
production, said Atkins.
Upon entering the gallery, one 
finds themselves in the world of 
the Omnicircus. The perfor
mance combines dancing, music, 
poetry, and robots into one 
frightening, but moving show. 
The robots are creations of Frank 
Garvey and the Omnicircus. The 
displayed collection includes two 
chariots and three robots all of 
which are adorned with bones, 
sirens, speakers, lights, and 
weapons.
From the Omnicircus, 
observers travel through the 
worlds of many other artists. 
Peter Coppin, who works with 
the STUDIO, is the project direc
tor forEventscope.-The project 
is a public interface for planetary 
exploration, allowing people to 
experience distant locations over 
the Internet. The project was 
started in 1999 and is still in
computer-based backscratcher. 
But the observer isnt the person 
reaping the rewards of the back 
scratch. Instead, they are the 
ones dealing out the service. The 
project consists of several seem
ingly human characters on a 
monitor begging for a back 
scratch. They yell, complain, 
instruct, and show appreciation 
for the participants efforts. From 
across the gallery, one can hear 
the longings of one of the charac
ters pleading for someones gra
cious services.
On a more serious side, the 
American Dream is a creation 
of Rob Fisher and will be com
pleted in 2002. Airplane passen
gers will soon enter the Arrivals 
Hall at the new Philadelphia 
International Airport to be greet
ed by words, signatures, and 
images of the Declaration of 
Independence. Thework will 
encompass three related sculp
tural statements. The walls will 
be illuminated with script and a 
glass railing adjacent to the 
entryway will be glowing with
signatures from the Declaration. 
The final component will be the 
Declaration itself, made of 
stained glass and divided into 13 
symbolic parts.
A collaborative project by 
subRosa is called Knowing 
Bodies. The work looks at 
cyberfeminism and the changing 
political, economic, and person
al conditions of womens lives 
because of new digital technolo
gy. The project doesnt stop at 
colorful photos, signs, and 
slides, but also includes several 
3D displays symbolizing the 
effects of technology on womens 
bodies and minds.
Heidi Kumao has included her 
pieces Saving Time, 2000 and 
Lullaby. Saving Time, 2000 is 
an assemblage of glass pieces 
measuring psychological units of 
time. Lullaby is a robotic 
stroller that rolls back and forth. 
The stroller also holds a 
small screen that displays images 
that appear to move closer 
and further away from 
the stroller as it moves back 
and forth, providing a 
rocking effect.
This is just a small sampling of 
the many and varying projects 
presented at the exhibit. Other 
projects involve landscape and 
architecture, computer program
ming, print media, Internet tech
nologies, and other areas of sci
ence. All of the projects make up 
the work being done at the STU
DIO for Creative Inquiry, which 
has now been in existence for 11 
years.
The organization offers 
research fellowships in an 
attempt to integrate the differing 
focuses of Carnegie Mellon in sci
ence and art. Far more than a 
setting for artists to appropriate 
the science and technology 
developed on the other side of 
the campus (although it is that, 
too), the STUDIO is a site of 
experimentation, observation, 
and exchange, said Atkins.

Gallery through September 29.
SoHo organization to serve as 
resource center for students
by Sara Amodio
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is fine 
with youbeing gay. August 
25 marked the opening of 
SoHo, Carnegie Mellons new 
resource center for gay, les
bian, bisexual, and transgen
der concerns.
Ron Ophir, a doctoral stu
dent in the Graduate School
and inviting, it also serves as 
a meeting place for organiza
tions such as cmuOUT and 
ALLIES. You may know some 
of the students, staff mem
bers, and faculty who belong 
to SoHos advisory commit
tee. Their periodic meetings 
provide support, connec
tions, and consistency for the 
organization.
The center is working on 
bringing in many more stuNuri Miller/Photo Staff

lar to this stark portrait. The title of the exhibit refers the layer of sod on the Frames floor.
The responsibility is on both 
sides...being heterosexual in a het
erosexual society... you dont real
ize how heterosexual it is 
 Ron Ophir
of Industrial Administration, 
is the coordinator of SoHo. 
He wants the organization to 
become an established part 
of the community and a place 
where you can be yourself. 
He wishes it to be a safe 
place, a place where gay, les
bian, bi, transgender, ques
tioning would feel comfort
able.
Ophir also feels that SoHo 
is a good place to visit if you 
are new to the campus. 
Often, people with a gay, les
bian, bisexual, or trahsgender orientation have difficul
ty talking about their lives 
with their family members or 
classmates. With the avail
ability of this new resource 
center, students will have 
more opportunities to inter
act with each other in a easy
going setting.
SoHo holds a wide array of 
magazines, books, and 
videos for the curious visitor 
to come and explore. Warm
dents, talks, summer series, 
discussions, and movies of 
interest to the Carnegie 
Mellon community. Recently, 
SoHo took a group of stu
dents to the Millennium 
March.
Ophir emphasizes that stu
dents, staff, and faculty 
members should feel free to 
stop by, regardless of their 
sexual orientation. He 
believes that the organiza
tion is good for both people 
who just want to learn about 
it as well as family and 
friends of GLBT people. It is 
important to make an effort 
to understand others. Ophir 
says, The responsibility is on 
both sides ... being hetero
sexual in a heterosexual soci
ety ... you dont realize how 
heterosexual it is.
Located in the Old Student 
Center just next to Cyert 
Hall, SoHo is a step away 
from the popular Indian food 
vendor, Taste of India and
the post office. The visibility 
of the space is important. It 
shows that GLBT concerns 
are equally integrated with 
the rest of school. Ophir 
explains, With SoHo, there 
is a symbolism as well as it 
being a functional place. In 
addition to cmuOUT, ALLIES, 
and the Womens Center, the 
new center signals that fur
ther efforts have been made 
by CMU to support gay, les
bian, bisexual, and transgen
der students people. Among 
those who have helped to 
produce SoHo are Michael 
Murphy, Dean of Student 
Affairs, Ginny Delaney, 
Administrative Associate to 
Student Affairs, cmuOUT 
member Duane Williams, 
and Oreste Prada, a 99 alum
nus.
Murphy explains that SoHo 
establishes an important 
resource and amplifies our 
vision that Carnegie Mellon 
is a place where all people 
can, should and do thrive. It 
is our greatest shared com
mitment as a campus  not 
in spite of, but in celebration 
of, our many differences in 
virtually every aspect of the 
human experience  and 
this is one more important 
tribute to that commitment.
At SoHos opening, Ophir 
was pleasantly surprised to 
see many people come and he 
is optimistic to bring more in. 
There will be a welcoming 
reception for Carnegie 
Mellon gay, lesbian, bisexual, 
and transgender students, as 
well as faculty, staff, and any 
other interested members of 
the community on Friday, 
September 8 from 5 to 7 pm 
in the West Wing TV room.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5. 2000
by Emily Landes
Senior Staff
The students on the Activities Board have 
one very simple goal. They just want to bring 
you musical acts that make you dance, guest 
lecturers that make you think and political 
speakers that make you active. But, even more 
importantly, they dont want you to have to
there.
The only other confirmed speaker for this 
year is Judy Shepard, who will be speaking on 
campus on March 21. Shepard has been an 
active participant in the movement for hate 
crime legislation since her gay son, Matthew, 
was murdered in 1998 because of his sexual 
orientation.
While Manista claims that none of these lec
tures are meant to be overtly political, Tanya

pay a cent for any of it.
It bothers me to charge for music, said 
Karari Hanks, senior chemistry major and the 
AB Concerts chair. As such, it took Hanks all 
summer to arrange free concerts with both 
Rusted Root and Blues Traveler this semester. 
The Rusted Root concert will take place this 
Friday on the CFA lawn. Hanks says that any
one is welcome to come to the concert, but if 
the band has to be moved to the rain location, 
Rangos Hall, then obviously AB has to limit the 
number of attendees. Therefore, beginning 
this Thursday, concert bracelets will be avail
able at the info desk on a first-come, firstserved basis for up to 800 CMU students.
Hanks is also planning a free outdoor show 
for Blues Traveler on October 20th, the Friday 
of Homecoming weekend. He is unsure of the 
location for that concert, but he does know 
that in the event of rain, the blues-rock band 
will play at Soldiers and Sailors, again, with 
bracelets available the week before at the info 
desk.
Of course, Hanks does not plan these con
certs alone. He relies heavily on the AB 
Concerts committee, and says that, in fact, the 
Rusted Root concert was planned for right 
after the Activities Fair in the hopes that it 
might inspire people to join his committee. 
We want to show people what AB Concerts 
does, he said. Anybody and everybody can 
join AB and we want as many people as possi
ble.
Nathaniel Manista, senior physics major and 
chair of AB Lectures, agrees. Input is always 
appreciated, he said. Come on down, we 
have lots of fun. Hanks and Manista also 
agree that this input is the key to assuring that 
more people are happy with the way their 
Activities Fee is being spent.
To that end, Manista has arranged for Mike 
Nelson to speak for free on September 18th. 
Nelson is best known as one of the stars of the 
Comedy Central cult hit Mystery Science 
Theater 3000. Though he is not a particular fan 
of MST3K, Manista feels that Nelson will be a 
big draw for the CMU community, and he 
hopes that the September 26 lecture by Green 
Party Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader will 
be just as big.
Though Manista stresses that the University 
takes no political stance on the upcoming elec
tion, he says that he would love to attract non
voters to this lecture, as well as people who 
feel alienated by the two-party system. He

Tarr, the AB Political Speakers Chair, has just 
the opposite intention. I want to repoliticize 
our campus, she said. Likening CMU to anoth
er heavily federally funded institution, the 
University of California at Berkeley, she 
claims, Just because were a research univer
sity, we dont have to be cut off from the 
world.
One of Tarrs main events will be a voter reg
istration drive during the first week of
October. Tarr, a senior political sci
ence and history and policy major, 
also hopes to bring Senate candidates 
Rick Santorum (R) and Ron Klink (D) 
to CMUs campus this fall. Those 
speakers have yet to be confirmed 
however, like Tarrs other target, 
Melissa Hart (R), a Pennsylvania state 
senator who is running for the U.S. 
House of Representatives.
Also unconfirmed but in the works 
is a possible concert with folk-pop 
singer Elliot Smith. Smith gained 
national recognition for his Oscarnominated song Miss Misery, from 
the Good Will Hunting soundtrack, 
and as such, he is one of the few AB 
attractions that will have a ticketprice, around seven dollars. Still, AB 
Coffeehouse chair Karthik Shyam says 
that he still believes an Elliot Smith 
concert would be very successful. He 
has cross-over appeal between the col
lege music scene and the popular 
music scene, said Shyam, a senior 
business major.
Other crossover acts include the 
rock band Versus, on October 23rd, 
and The Grifters, on November 18th.

Louisiana State University student reflects on his MTV Road trip season
BATON ROUGE (U-WIRE)  Theo 
Vonkurnatowski walks through New Orleans 
Riverwalk mall amid whispers and stares from 
other shoppers. I definitely feel popular, he says. 
Not like a celebrity, but definitely popular.
Theo, a mass communication junior, is somewhat 
of a celebrity, thanks to MTV*s Road Rules, a show 
that follows six people travelling the country in a 
Winnebago.
After several interviews and trips to Los Angeles 
to meet with the shows creators and producers, 
Theo made the final cut, joining five 20-somethings 
last January for 10 weeks of challenges from coast 
to coast.
The cast of Road Rules: Maximum Velocity Tour 
completed a variety of *:asks on their adventure, 
including skiing, stealing the electronic dog from 
the Real World New Orleans house, and finding peo
ple willing to test a penis-enlarging pump.
Theo, a Mandeville, Louisiana native, peppers 
most of his comments about the trip and his castmates with his own variations of ridiculous.
A recent episode in which the cast must run from 
a pack of police dogs in escaped-convict fashion 
entertains Theo and a group of friends preparing to 
take on the New Orleans nightlife for the first time 
since the show began airing. Ah, this was ri-sickulous, Theo whines.
The group laughs, shaking their heads as his 
voice meshes with his voice on television for one of 
Theos most memorable on-air quotes. Were fugi
tives on the run from the law, they say.
Some of the people in the evenings entourage 
say they look forward to reaping the benefits of 
hanging out with an MTV personality. Theos the 
chick magnet, says Micajah Burke semi-seriously. 
I just want seconds.
Theos tendency to speak freely on the show has 
created wrong impressions, he says. During the 
shows casting special, introducing the MTV audi
ence to prospective Road Rulers, Theo said in one 
interview that he was against interracial dating and 
that blacks and whites should not mix.
They had hours of tape and they picked that [to 
show on-air], he explains. So Im not a fan of 
interracial dating. I dont hate black people. I dont 
hate Asian people. I dont hate anybody. Im just 
chiilin.
As for his reputation after the show ends, Theo 
does not seem worried. People drink that 
Haterade, he says flatly. Theo blames the shows 
head honchos for editing tape throughout the trip 
to create more drama, and subsequently, better rat
ings.
Theyre just trying to make a show, he claims. 
Thats what theyre all about. He says that, if peo
ple call him ignorant, he will embrace it. Theo 
claims that, without ignorance, the world would 
turn a little slower and life would be less exciting.
I think ignorance is the funniest thing in the 
world, he says. I went to high school with people 
always looking for their bookbags.
Many episodes include adventures in several 
cities spliced together to appear more interesting 
and glamorous, he says.
Theo says he knew the casting directors were 
looking for an outspoken person when he audi
tioned at the Spanish Moon last October.
I basically talk smack about everything, he 
says. Anything you say that can be controversial 
can put you in the drivers seat. Uh, passengers 
seat. I dont have a drivers license. Theo is driving 
as he says this.
Technicalities, he says with a smile.
When a producer called him to confirm that he 
made the last cut, Theo says he was at a crucial 
point in his video game and brushed the guy off. I 
was like, dude, Ill call you back when I finish this 
game, he says.
His flair for candid conversation comes in handy 
when questions about his relationships with the 
other cast members arise. Holly, a California girl 
with a self-proclaimed love for sex and competi
tion, caused stress in the group from day one, Theo 
says.
I knew I hated her from the second I met her, he 
sums up.
He does not have many nice things to say about 
the cast in general. A friend asks him how to pro
nounce Msaada, another cast mates name. Mboring, Theo says quickly..
Okay.
He does add that James, a rugby player at the 
University of California at Berkeley, became one of 
his best friends, and is the only cast member he 
likes.
I felt not really sure if I wanted to be part of this 
group, he said. These are people who got picked 
because theyre supposed to be real. All they were 
serving is bull.
Theo says he believes some of the cast members 
showed their true colors when the cameras were 
not around. Sometimes I felt like there were nine 
people on the show instead of six; he says.
Some of the challenges, earning the cast $6,000 
or more if completed, demanded more strategic 
efforts than others, Theo says.
He refers to the groups task to baby-sit six sets of 
twins for 24 hours as ri-donkey-lous. Crying, 
messy, hungry toddlers overwhelmed the cast until 
Theo saved the day. I just lined them up and fed
them all cough syrup to put them to sleep, he said.
The cast came to Baton Rouge on a mission to 
pose in front of Mike the Tigers cage with the Real 
World dog.
The group partied with Theos friends after the 
mission, resulting in a session of rolling the 
Winnebago with toilet paper.
We just wanted to get on film, says Reese 
Williamson, a management junior who participated 
in the prank. We didnt.
Adjusting back to normal life was difficult when 
the show first aired in June, Theo says. You walk 
in every place and expect people to recognize you, 
he says.
He spent most of his summer in California and 
New York, promoting the show, doing commercials 
and meeting past Road Rules and Real World mem
bers at a group barbecue. I met Puck, he says, 
referring to the snot-rocket guy from the Real World 
in San Francisco. That was cooL
After returning to Mandeville in July, Theo 
worked in a local restaurant, re-introducing himself 
to life as a college student. His first day on the job 
was a tough one, he recalls. After months of soak
ing up the good life as an MTV star, waiting tables 
seemed like hard work, he says. I was like, Cant I 
just get paid for nothing?, he says.
Theo says he felt the entire Road Rules trip was 
just a crazy dream. I thought if I died doing [a 
challenge], I would wake up in Mandeville, he 
said.
Despite bad blood among the cast members and 
ri-sick-ulous challenges, Theo says he learned a 
lot about himself and others on the journey. You 
re-evaluate everything, he says. Every section, all 
the time. The world seems not only larger to me, 
but much more tangible.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5. 2000
Student Activities Fair set for this Friday
by Joanna Smiley
Arts and Living Editor
Every year around this time, CMUs Student Activities 
Board organizes an event that rocks the campus  the 
one, the only, Student Activities Fair. For those of you 
who arent quite sure what this means, it is a great 
opportunity to become involved in any of the more than 
100 different student organizations active at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Some of the prominent clubs and activities on campus 
include kayaking, volleyball, robot building, an Ultimate 
Frisbee team, wrestling, Tae Kwon Do, dancing, skiing, 
Aikido, community outreach, photography, film, ball
room dancing, Emergency Medical Service (EMS) volun
teering, hiking, theater, improvisational comedy and 
juggling. In other words, almost any sort of organization 
you can think of is likely to appear somewhere at this 
years Activities Fair.
Karari Hanks, senior chemistry major and Activities 
Board Concerts committee chairman, didnt want to give 
anything away about what to expect from his group on
Friday, but he did mention that there are going to be a 
lot of little people.
One organization that stands apart from most others is 
the EMS volunteer program. Adam Berson, a senior elec
trical and computer engineering major and member of 
the EMS organization, explains that EMS is an unusual 
activity. Its really a service for the community, which 
makes it different from many of the student clubs. And, 
its not only open to students; faculty, graduate students 
and members of the community are also welcome to 
join.
Representatives from student groups and organiza
tions around campus will be setting up booths on the 
Mall this Friday, ready and waiting to answer any ques
tions about their clubs. Food will be served starting at 
4:30, and a concert will also take place. So, if you are 
looking for a great way to explore what Carnegie Mellon 
has to offer, check out these student organizations! 
Afterwards, dont forget that Rusted Root will be per
forming, and may even be doing their sound check 
while the fair is going on. With all that excitement, 
Friday is bound to be an occasion you will not want to 
miss!

50 YEARS AGO, September 14,1950 'Emanon captured their sec
ond straight All-Points Trophy for athletic competition, winning the 
final trophy awarded in CIT history. Emanon toppled second place Delta 
Tau Delta by a final count of 1669 to 1210. Rounding out the top five 
were Theta Xi A, independent team the Dorm Dukes, and Sigma Nu 
A.
After 1950, the school decided to stop awarding the All-Points Trophy 
in the hopes of increasing sportsmanship among the competitors. 
Currently, all sports standings are still kept for both mens and womens 
organizations.
25 YEARS AGO, September 3,1975  The University banned pets 
from all campus buildings, beginning July 1, in response to numerous 
complaints about animals roaming the campus. In addition, all dogs 
present anywhere on campus were required to be leashed, as a response 
to reports of dogs biting and begging.
When asked about the nevv policy, Vice President for Business Affairs 
Richard Van Horn described an incident where a janitor unlocked a pre
sumably empty office to clean it at night and was accosted by a large dog 
that had been trapped inside. Other custodians had repeatedly lodged 
complaints about animal excrement in buildings and around the campus 
in general.
10 YEARS AGO, September 4, 1990  CMU resident protestor 
Vincent Eirene held a press conference outside Doherty Hall to accuse 
the Universitys Department of Computer Science of being involved with 
the United States Defense Department. Previously, Eirene had opposed 
CMUs Software Engineering Institute for the same reasons.
Eirene targeted a system developed in part by the CS department 
called Command Action Team (CAT) used to monitor and assess possi
ble threats to aircraft carriers. Provost Angel Jordan responded by say
ing that, while the University accepts a good deal of Defense 
Department funding, no research projects are considered to be classi
fied and do not have immediate military purposes.
FIVE YEARS AGO, September 5,1995  Martin Rimm, a graduate 
of CMUs ECE department, came under scrutiny in light of complaints 
about the integrity of Rimms work. His study, Marketing Pornography 
on the Information Superhighway, landed him the cover of Time maga
zine and an invitation to speak before the U.S. Senate.
Unfortunately, complaints about Rimms manipulation of data, inva
sion of Andrew users privacy, and unsubstantiated conclusions led 
University officials to conduct an investigation into the studys scholar
ship and the methods by which the data were acquired and used. Later 
issues of The Tartan delved further into the story.
ONE YEAR AGO, August 30, 1999  Due to overcrowding and 
complications with housing reservations, 46 students were placed in 
temporary housing. In past years, students were placed in the Hampton 
Inn. However, this year, Carnegie Mellon was able to reach a deal with 
the more luxurious Shadyside Inn.
In addition to costing less for the University, the new accomodations 
proved to be much nicer for students. Those placed in temporary hous
ing here were given fully furnished separate bedrooms and access to a 
television, a kitchen, and a full bathroom.
Most of the students were able to be moved rather quickly into per
manent on-campus housing. Living accomodations were freed up for a 
variety of reasons, including cancellations, transfers, and dropouts. Bob 
Wilson, Associate Director of Housing Services, hoped that all of the 
first-year students could be moved into campus housing by the end of 
the second week of classes.
A tougher problem was the 12 upper-class and transfer students 
placed into the Shadyside Inn to begin the year. While in the past the 
University didnt guarantee housing, this year they were. This situation 
led to some debate over whether or not the school should consider con
structing a new dormitory.

changed its Master of Science 
Degree in Industrial Administration 
to a Master of Business
Administration degree. The move 
to change the degree name was 
prompted by the creation of confu
sion amongst the business world at 
the old moniker and the fact that 
GSIA has given up on its past in 
favor of the New Economy.
The new degree name change 
will help the world identify and 
appreciate one of the nations top 
schools for business management 
education, said GSIA Dean 
Douglas M. Dunn.
The schools Master of Science in 
Electronic Commerce degree, a 
joint venture between the School of 
Computer Science and GSIA, the 
first such degree in the nation, will 
continue to be designated as such 
because of its brand equity.CMU Latin explosion
This Thursday, September 9, 
GSIA will host the first teleconfer
ence between partner universities 
in five Latin American countries, 
including Mexico, Chile, Columbia, 
Ecuador and El Salvador. The 
meeting will commence a new edu
cational network made to provide 
training in how technology can

Fee, fi, fo, fum; Student banking isnt much fun
by Brad Grantz
Business Editor
Although one can most certainly 
hear students moaning over the 
plight of their pockets, the cashstrapped collegian is one of the 
most fiercely sought after con
sumers in America. Practically 
every commercial sector is aware of 
the tremendous purchasing power 
(or future financial supremacy) of 
the student, including banks.
Area financial institutions have 
begun to offer special banking 
packages to students needing 
school year services. Both major 
commercial Pittsburgh banks have 
created unique accounts exclusive
ly designed for students. Other area 
institutions use conventional meth
ods to draw pupils through their 
doors, such as standard checking 
accounts with nominal fees.
Of course, nominal fees seem to 
have become more and more com
mon. Fees range from ATM to debit 
cards and just about every type of 
transaction you can imagine.
Carnegie Mellon University has 
partnered with Mellon Financial to 
allow students to direcdy connect 
with Mellon to set up an account 
prior to the start of the school year. 
Mellons student checking program 
costs a minimum of $6 a month 
(the fee is waived during the 
months of June, July, and August).
The idea of a service charge has 
altered the consumer-banker rela
tionship for the last half of the 
1990s as banks have moved toward 
becoming financial services compa
nies through the miracle of govern
ment deregulation. While banks 
still rely on John Q. Publics hardearned money to fuel their compa
nys loan segment, many banks 
have leaned further toward tending 
to the needs of the corporations.
Mellons student checking 
account permits individuals to 
write eight checks a month without 
incurring a processing fee of $.60. 
With plastic banking becoming 
more favored than traditional 
checking, Mellon offers account 
holders standard ATM cards for an 
additional dollar a month. 
However, a student looking to uti
lize the power of the debit card has 
to cough up a one time charge of 
$10. However, students wanting a 
Mellon debit card must go through 
a credit approval process. Students 
can also experience the convience 
of banking via computer - Mellons 
competitive advantage over many 
other area banks.
After knowing the options of a 
Mellon student checking account, 
one may consider the Mellon 
Direct24 account. Designed for 
online and electronic processing 
with minimal human interaction, 
Direct24 allows account holders to 
do practically all their banking via

Finding a cash dispenser can be a harrowing task if one isnt familar with the location of area banks. The Freedom 
Alliance, a network of banks not charging ATM fees, allows students belonging to a member bank the luxury of avoid

phone or, more convenient for the 
CMU student, via the Web. While 
the Direct24 account charges an $8 
monthly service fee for 12 months 
of the year, it does not require extra 
payment for online bill paying ($5 
a month charge for 12 months with 
the Mellon student account).
Online bill paying allows an indi
vidual to avoid the check process 
altogether. For example, if one 
received an invoice from an online 
bookstore, he or she could enter 
their respective online bank and set 
up his or her account to automati
cally send payment to the book
store, with the correct information.
Additional fees may strike a stu
dent account or Direct24 account 
owner. Direct24 charges a $13 a 
month teller service charge if that 
person visits one of the banks liv
ing human beings once or several 
times during that time span.
Said Julie Sten, a Mellon public 
relations officer, Banking is mov
ing toward an electronic environ
ment. Ergo, Mellon gears users 
toward the web and telephone and 
away from the teller with service 
charges.
A student with a Mellon account 
will pay a minimum of $54 a year 
just to be able to get money. Of 
course, dont expect to earn interest 
on your small fortune. No bank in 
the area provides interest-earning 
accounts without the requirement 
of a minimum balance.
Mellons cross-town rival, PNC 
Corporation, also offers a specialty 
account just for students. Instead of 
students having a non-interest 
bearing checking account, PNC 
gives its customers both a checking

CHICAGO (AP) - United Airlines 
machinists sought federal mediation 
Friday to resolve contract talks that a 
union spokesman said have come 
down to crunch time.
In a separate reflection of continuing 
labor tension at the world's biggest 
airline, flight attendants announced 
plans for informational picketing at 
major airports to protest alleged abus
es and contract violations during 
Uniteds chaotic summer.
The moves came at the start of one of 
the busiest travel weekends of the 
year. United reported 60 flight cancel
lations as of late afternoon Friday, 
which along with Monday are the two 
most heavily booked days of the Labor 
Day travel period.
The International Association of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers 
f^led an application with the National 
Mediation Board, seeking assistance 
in talks representing 15,000 mechan
ics and related workers.
Tlie action came six days after the air
line reached a tentative agreement 
with pilots and promised to make set
tling with machinists a top priority. 
United has accused disgruntled 
mechanics of trying to disrupt the
airline's operations by participating 
in a sickout on the eve of the 
Democratic Convention in Los 
Angeles and by refusing to work 
overtime. But despite rumors they 
might stage labor actions over the 
holiday, union officials said no 
action is authorized and avoided a 
confrontational tone in discussing 
the status of negotiations.
We see applying for mediation as a 
positive step," said Robert Roach Jr., a 
vice president of the machinists 
union who attended talks this week. 
This gets us closer to an industryleading agreement, and that has been 
our goal from the beginning. 
Meanwhile, the Association of Flight 
Attendants announced it is applying 
for picketing permits at airports in 12 
U.S. cities and seven cities abroad. 
Flight attendants stood by United in 
its summer of turmoil, said Linda 
Farrow, president of the AFA master 
executive council at United. In 
return, management has wreaked 
havoc on our family and personal lives 
by systematically breaking the rules it 
has agreed to in our contract and by 
heavy-handed discipline. Now, we're 
fighting back.

About the index: The index is based on 16 widely held stocks that 
we feel represent Pittsburgh based and national companies that 
CMU students are interested in. The index is based on a start-date 
of 24 January. The initial index is calculated by adding the value
of the 16 stocks together and multiplying by ten._______________
Index News: In line with adoption of decimal trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ exchange, The Tartan will 
print all quotes in the decimal format instead of as fractions. 
There were two stock splits since the last issue of the paper

free teller transaction per month. 
Students are also permitted to 
obtain the PNC Bank Check Card, 
or debit card, without fee. 
Additionally, student account hold
ers need not worry about PNC 
adding a surcharge for ATM 
machine uses. While practically 
every area bank will charge a non

ATM, several will charge their own 
account owners ATM fees for using 
their own ATM machines.
Teller fees are also becoming

after reports or irate customers

Penn and Redleaf working 
with startup students
(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA/T/ie 
Daily Pennsylvanian - Dreaming of 
dropping out of school, forming an 
Internet start-up and becoming a 
billionaire over night? Penn is hop
ing its new e-business accelerator 
will let students skip the first step.
The University is in the process of 
converting a former plumbing 
warehouse at 3025 Walnut Street 
into a high-tech start-up accelera
tor  PenNetWorks  to support 
developing start-up computer and 
biotechnology companies in the 
area.
In August, officials announced 
that the facility will be managed by 
Redleaf Group, Inc., a firm with 
headquarters in Pittsburgh and 
Silicon Valley that assists people 
starting technology companies 
with financial and administrative 
support.
Redleaf believes that some of 
the best entrepreneurs are closer to 
the dorm room than the board 
room in their business expertise, 
Redleaf co-Chief Executive Officer 
C. Lloyd Mahaffey said in a written 
statement.
The facility will temporarily be 
housed at 3535 Market Street, on 
the Avenue of Technology. The 
interim location is expected to be 
operational by October, according 
to a statement from Redleaf.
[PenNetWorks] will offer good, 
usable space and strong technical 
support for individuals who are
attempting to commercialize their 
ideas, Executive Vice President 
John Fry said in June.
Were trying to provide real 
opportunities for space and sup
port and keep our entrepreneurs in 
the area, Fry added.
University officials and trustees 
hope the facility will encourage 
students and faculty with business 
ideas to base their companies in 
the Philadelphia area.
PenNetWorks will focus on early 
stage support where entrepre
neurs come and get support, nur
ture ideas, then graduate to larger 
space, like the University City 
Science Center's Port of Technology 
facility, Fry said.
Costs for the project were still 
being determined in June, and con
struction on the facility will likely 
take between nine months and a 
year, depending on the condition of 
the building, Fry said.
Fry said that while the 
PenNetWorks facilities will be 
available to those associated with 
any of the Universitys schools, 
researchers at the schools will not 
be limited to using it.
This isnt something that people 
have to use on a mandatory basis, 
Fry said. If schools want to work 
with another incubator, thats fine, 
too.
The accelerator is meant for pro
fessors, students and also commu
nity residents.

Music workers scouring for jobs
LOS ANGELES (AP)  A company that makes software for trading 
music and video over the Internet is 
laying off two-thirds of its staff, 
fueling speculation about the firms 
collapse.
Scour, Inc., has unsuccessfully 
sought additional financing while 
fighting a lawsuit brought by two 
giants of the entertainment indus
try in July. On Friday, it announced 
it is laying off 52 of its 70 employ
ees.
The Beverly Hills-based compa
ny, whose backers include former 
Disney executive and agent 
Michael Ovitz, faces mounting 
legal expenses over the lawsuit 
filed in July by the Motion Picture 
Association of America and the 
Recording Industry Association of 
America accusing it of copyright 
infringement.CA Nightmare for Microsoft
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  
California, traditionally a gold 
mine for Microsoft Corp.,. now 
looms as a potential minefield for 
the computer software maker.
A San Francisco judge decided 
Tuesday to certify a private 
antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft 
as a class action, representing mil
lions of California consumers.
If successful, the suit could cost 
Microsoft billions of dollars 
because of laws that triple the dam
ages in antitrust cases, said Herbert 
Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert.
The California lawsuit, which 
combined dozens of similar cases 
filed against Microsoft throughout 
the state, is only the second con
sumer complaint against the com
pany to be certified as a class 
action.
The stakes involved may turn the 
California lawsuit into Microsofts 
second biggest headache after the 
federal governments long-running 
antitrust suit. The fate of the 
California case  scheduled for a 
2002 trial date  probably will be 
intertwined with Microsofts 
appeal of the antitrust verdict 
handed down against the company 
in June.WorldCom adding generic names
JACKSON, Miss. (AP)  
WorldCom Inc. is expected to 
announce this week it will buy 
Intermedia Communications Inc. 
in order to acquire that company's 
controlling stake in Digex Inc., a 
Web services company.
The Wall Street Journal reported 
Sunday that WorldCom offered a 
cash-and-stock deal valuing 
Tampa, Fla.-based Intermedia at 
$39 per share. WorldComs bid 
topped a $22 per share offer by 
rival Global Crossing Ltd., a 
Bermuda-based provider of fiber
optic networks.
Intermedia provides voice and 
data services to more than 90,000 
business and government cus
tomers across the United States and 
is listed as one of the nations top 
independent competitive local 
exchange carriers.
Intermedia offers local and long
distance service and offers Internet 
and data services through its 64 
percent stake in Digex.
Beltsville, Md.-based Digex hosts 
Web sites and other Web-based 
applications for more than 550 cus
tomers, including large retailers 
like J. Crew, automotive manufac
turer Nissan and others. It operates 
two data centers in the United 
States and one in the United 
Kingdom.
Digex reported 1999 revenue of 
$59.8 million, but lost $65 million 
during the fiscal year.
The source familiar with deal 
said WorldCom is most interested 
in acquiring the stake in Digex 
because Digexs operations dovetail 
with Clinton, Miss.-based 
WorldComs generation d initia
tive, the companys push into Webrelated services and products 
aimed primarily at business cus
tomers.

Verizon strike causes phone, network 
difficulties for off-campus community
McDonalds in big trouble near China
HONG KONG (AP)  Scores of 
underage workers hired in a main
land China factory that makes toys 
for McDonalds were fired follow
ing recent media reports about the 
situation, a Hong Kong labor-moni
toring group said Monday.
Factory officials also threatened 
the teenagers into lying about the 
conditions of their workplace if 
asked by inspectors, the Hong Kong 
Christian Industrial Committee 
said.
They were told to move out 
within three days or else theyd be 
taken away by the police, said 
Monina Wong, spokeswoman for 
the group, which said it obtained 
its information by talking to some 
of the young workers.
McDonalds responded Monday
with a statement saying the compa
ny takes the underage labor allega
tions seriously and is conducting an 
intensive, top-to-bottom inspec
tion by a full-scale auditing team 
at the plant just across the border in 
Shenzhen.
McDonalds said it has inter
viewed 500 employees, and added 
that it has a strict policy for work
ing conditions at plants run by its 
suppliers  prohibiting child labor 
among other things  and any 
company that does not comply can 
lose its business from McDonalds.
The story first appeared on Aug. 
27 in the South China Morning 
Post, which said a reporter infiltrat
ed the plant and interviewed a 
number of the workers who were as 
young as 14, two years below the
minimum age, working 16-hour 
days in spartan conditions that 
include crowded dorm rooms that 
contain wooden beds with no mat
tresses.
Some of the young workers were 
quoted by the Post as saying they 
lied about their age to gain employ-' 
ment at City Toys Ltd., the company 
that produces such items as 
Snoopy, Hello Kitty, and Winnie the 
Pooh dolls sold with McDonalds 
meals.
An outside auditor employed 
by McDonalds declined com-' 
ment, and Pleasure Tech 
Holdings Ltd., the company that 
operates the Shenzhen factory 
through its subsidiary, City Toys 
Ltd., did not return repeated 
phone calls.
Student assets are big bucks for area banks
CHECKING, from page L6 
member account holders.
What type of solutions exist to avoid the fee-forall? Outside of Oakland are several smaller banks that 
will not charge fees for the various reasons mentioned. 
If they belong to the Freedom ATM Alliance, you can 
avoid surcharges on withdrawals. Of course, check 
depositing represents a difficult task without the 
mobility of an automobile.
To avoid other type of ATM fees, use your debit 
card at whatever type of business you can. Many will
offer you the ability to receive cash back. By doing 
so, you can avoid the costly fee. Treat yourself to a 
pack of gum and take the grocery store to the clean
ers.
Whether they include an overdraft fee for bounc
ing a check, or an ATM machine charge, students 
should research all the options available thorough
ly before making a banking choice. Any bank teller, 
should be able to give you the run-down on the com
panys account types; and they wont charge you a fee; 
for asking.

of the CWA strike.
They [Verizon service represen
tatives] informed me that my 
phone number would be connected 
by Friday [September 1], but Im 
still without service, lamented 
Anderson.
The strike settlement is similar to 
the one agreed to by the 
International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the 
CWA in New York and New 
England. The agreement calls for a 
cap of 10( overtime hours a week for 
Verizon customer service center 
employees until January 1, 2001 
when the cap is lowered to 8 hours 
a week.
A 12 percent wage increase over 
the three-year life of the contract 
and improvements in pension and 
other benefits are identical to the 
agreements signed in New York 
and New England.
Perhaps most revolutionary for 
the industry workers is that 
employees can earn bonuses of 
up to 10 percent of their base pay 
for meeting business unit objec
tives.
The company will increase fund
ing for various work and family 
programs and extend health bene
fits to 25-year-old family members 
in college from the previous age 
limit of 23 years. Union employees 
also will receive options for 100 
shares of Verizon common stock 
prior to the end of the year.
While many students have expe
rienced delays in telephone ser
vice, a smaller backlog of work 
exists for those wishing to install a 
digital subscriber line (DSL) for 
their computer.
Sharon Shaffer, Public Relations 
Director for Pennsylvania, reported 
only seven purchase orders need
ing to be completed in the area. The 
normal lead time between a cus
tomer placing an order and DSL 
activation is 15 days.
Unfortunately, DSL is the only 
option for off-campus residents 
of Pittsburghs eastern neighbor
hoods. AT& Ts At Home, the 
cable modem online product, has 
no timetable for when this sec
tion of the city will have the ser
vice.
Despite the recent merger and 
associated strike problems, Verizon 
announced last week plans for an 
expansion of its North Hills wire
less center. The facility will add 
about 300 customer service jobs.

Dramatic, Oscar-potential fall films may 
put an end to the summer blockbusters
FALL MOVIE PREVIEW
by Andy FrancisAssistant Arts & Living Editor
Once again its September at 
your local Cineplex. Time for the 
big movie studios to pack away 
the summer blockbuster popcorn 
flicks like Scary Movie and 
Mission:Impossible and dust off 
some more thoughtful, arty pic
tures. That said, here are a dozen 
potentially interesting movies 
being released in the next couple 
of months:
Almost Famous: Coming off 
of the mega-successful Jerry 
Maguire, director Cameron Crowe 
returns with this ode to 70s rock. 
For Crowe, who got his start as a 
teenage reporter covering Led 
Zeppelin, the film has a semiautobiographical feel to it. 
Starring Billy Crudup as the front
man of the fictional band 
Stillwater, Almost Famous looks to 
have a nostalgic flavor similar to 
that of Dazed and Confused.
Bamboozled: This Spike Lee 
joint, in characteristic Lee fash
ion, takes a good, hard look at 
race relations. This time out he 
trains his eye on racism in the 
television industry with a plot 
focusing on performers in black
face. On board are ex-/n Living 
Color cast members Damon 
Wayans and Tommy Davidson, as 
well as Jada Pinkett Smith and tap 
star Savion Glover.
The Blair Witch Project 2: 
Book of Shadows: I simply
couldnt leave this .one off my list. 
Not that its going to be ground
breaking, but the first Blair Witch 
was the success story of last year. 
This time around, the doomed 
youngsters get derailed in the 
middle of a Blair Witch reality 
tour and all scariness ensues.
Bounce: Your fall dose of
romantic comedy is here, starring 
the are-they-or-arent-they couple 
of Ben Affleck and Gwyneth 
Paltrow. After giving his airline 
ticket up to Paltrows husband, 
Ben decides to move in on Gwyn 
when the aforementioned flight 
goes down in flames.
Into the Arms of Strangers :
Without a doubt the movie you 
want to take that serious chick to, 
this gritty documentary starring 
Judi Dench tells the story of the 
Kindertransport that helped 
thousands of Jewish children 
escape Germany and flee to 
Britain.
Meet the Parents: A funlooking comedy, Meet the Parents 
teams unlikely costars Robert De 
Niro and Ben Stiller, and is 
helmed by Austin Powers director 
Jay Roach. De Niro plays Stillers 
potential father-in-law and pretty 
much makes things really difficult 
for the young man. Expect plenty 
of laughs.
Nurse Betty: Directed by Neil 
La Bute, the auteur behind unset
tling comedies like In the 
Company of Men and Your Friends 
and Neighbors, the movie stars 
Renee Zellweger as the title char
acter, who happens to be in love 
with a TV doctor (Greg Kinnear). 
Complicating her dreams of meet
ing him is the fact that shes being 
chased by two crimesters 
(Morgan Freeman and Chris 
Rock) after accidentally witness
ing a crime.
Pay It Forward: Possibly the 
best candidate for feel-good 
movie of the fall is this Oscarnominee studded picture. Kevin 
Spacey plays an elementary 
school teacher who gives his class
Touchstone Pictures
In Unbreakable, Bruce Willis (center) stars as David Dunn. After surviv
ing a catastrophic train wreck, he meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) 
who offers a bizarre, supernatural explanation of the event.
a peculiar assignment: make the 
world better. Haley Joel Osment 
also stars as one of Spaceys stu
dents who comes up with the idea 
to start a chain letter of good 
deeds.
Remembering the Titans:
Not your typical small-townteam-wins-it-all football movie, 
Titans stars Denzel Washington as 
football coach Herman Boone. 
Based on the true story of a 70s 
high school football team in 
Virginia, the film explores the 
racial tensions caused by the 
teams integrated roster and 
coaching staff.
Under Suspicion: A remake 
of the French psychological clas
sic Garde a Vue, this Morgan 
Freeman-Gene Hackman pic 
looks to be one of the more cere
bral films of the season. Remakes 
of obscure movies can be a risky 
proposition (Diabolique), but this 
one looks to be pretty sharp.
Unbreakable: Good things 
happen when Bruce Willis and 
Samuel L. Jackson team up. This 
time out, they costar in this sus
pense thriller from The Sixth Sense 
creator M. Night Shyamalan. 
Willis portrays an amazingly 
durable train wreck survivor, 
while Jackson stars as a fragile 
man who may be able to explain 
why.
Woman on Top: Not surpris
ingly, this film is aimed primarily 
at female audiences. Penelope 
Cruz handles the title role of a 
successful woman who likes to be 
in control of everything, particu
larly what goes on in the bed
room.
Well, there you have it. 
Certainly there are tons more to 
be released soon, but something 
among these 12 should appeal to 
pretty much any filmgoer. Enjoy 
the show!

Momo Starbuck
. Hey kids. Summers over; and Momo is back in 
high gear! I know you all probably had awful 
lu,ck with the opposite sex and got stuck in mis
erable, low-paying jobs, all because you didnt 
have your dear Momo there to help you along. 
Well, it serves you right! I slave and slave and 
slave for you. But you never call, you never 
write. Did I get one postcard all summer from 
you miserable bookworms? I think not! But as I 
am a forgiving soul, I will continue to lavish you 
poor creatures with my stellar guidance. Just 
don't forget Momo come Christmas, you hear?

All riglit goats. Funs over. Time to get back 
into the swirig of.things. Youve all been lazy 
pieces of rubber vomit this past summer, and 
its high time you put tha^eigHt-pound wad of 
gray matter to use. No, I'dont mean your fee

cooking tips from that Ally Mcgeal chic. Does 
it look like she can keep anything in her stom

Since you fish; probably spent/most of this 
summer swiniming through salt water and 
. chlorine, I figured Id give you so^ne skin tips 
to give you the healthy glow Momo is famous 
for. First, elbow grease: not just for elbows! 
Rub that stuff all over.,Youll shine like a
rhinestone! Second, dont pick your zits. You 
can pop, just dont dig. Say it with me, I can 
pop, but I cant dig. I can pop, but I cant dig. 
Also, if youre in a jam, you can use canola oil 
for a moisturizer. Just use sparingly or people 
may feel compelled to rub your face in baking 
pans and skillets.
Aries
(March 21 - April 19)
Hey, you rams! Were going, to h^ve a quick 
lesson about personal' space. In class, if you 
can reach over and touch1 the persons nose 
without fully extending.your arin^ youre too 
close. If youre in line,- arid you cajn smell the 
hair of the person in front cif ypu, youre too 
close. If you can see what your professor had 
for lunch" by what remains "in their teeth, 
youre sitting too close to the front. And lastly, 
if you drive a BMW and you like long walks on 
the beach as well as quiet nights at home, 
youre never too close to Momo.
Taurus
(April 20 - May 20)
A wise woman once said, I dont want no 
scrubs. Oh, how true, how true. You all. are a 
disgrace! Ivebeen massaging my upper lip 
with yicks Vapor Rub to keep from smelling 
you! This is no way to begin the academic 
year. I suggest you try my new line of bath 
products, Mojo, by Momo. Taking some 
hints from that Austin babe, Ive managed to 
capture my mojo in a silky smooth facial scrub, 
shower gel, and exfoliating body scrub. Youll 
not only be clean, but youll be as appealing as 
yours truly, as if thats even possible.

Cheap Movies
(for cheap students)
movies you may have seen before
BY ANDY FRANCIS
The Virgin Suicides
Thursday, September 7
Quite the provocative title theyve got for this flick. Aside from 
that, the movie isnt as provocative as one might think. Told from 
the point of view of brothers who really want to score with pret
ty much any of five sisters (presumably the virgins alluded to in 
the title), the movie closely examines teenage despair and 
anguish. Most notable is the films director, Sofia Coppola, trying 
to follow in the footsteps of her legendary father Francis Ford 
Coppola and perhaps even her husband, Being John Malkovich 
auteur Spike Jonze.
The eldest of the five sisters is portrayed by Kirsten Dunst, who 
has made the wise career move of being successively hotter in 
every movie she appears in. I dont see why they cant write that 
into the contract of more of Hollywoods leading ladies. That way 
they wouldnt be allowed to get all old and stuff. Just a thought.
Anyway, this movie drew some critical praise for its honesty 
and directness, so if youre into that sort of junk you might want 
to check this out instead of spending another Thursday in front 
of the Lifetime Channel.
At 8 pm, 10 pm, and midnight
In McConomy Auditorium
Frequency
Friday, September 8
Guaranteed to be the most confusing movie on the weekend 
slate is Frequency, seeing as how it deals with inter-time commu
nication. The story focuses on a NYC firefighter who finds a 
magic radio (with CD player and surround sound) that allows 
him to talk 30 years back in time to his long-deceased father, 
who perished a long time ago while battling a blaze. Naturally, 
the son (Dermis Quaid) tries to help dear old Dad out, but this is 
the movies, so his efforts end up causing a whole new set of prob
lems, which the two guys have to work together to try to fix.
I really am tired of all the debate over what would actually hap
pen if people had the capability to go back in time. Its really pret
ty simple. See, if you go back in time, then whatever you do will 
change the course of events after that point. No, thats stupid, 
how would you ever have gone back in time in the first place? 
No, no, thats right, youre already there so it doesnt matter what 
you did in the future to get there. But what happens to you in the 
future? Never mind. Time travel sucks.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
The Whole Nine Yards
Saturday, September 9
Man, bad things can happen when Friends cast members sneak 
onto the big screen. Sure, Lisa Kudrow got some respect for The 
Opposite of Sex and Jennifer Aniston was OK in Office Space, but 
who greenlighted David Schwimmers The Pallbearer or Matt 
LeBlancs Ed? Nevertheless, Matthew Perry decided to try his 
hand at movies again, playing a mild-mannered dentist whose 
life takes a big U-turn when a mobster (Bruce Willis) moves in 
right next door. Thanks to Perrys scheming ex-wife, though, the 
situation gets way more complicated than it should. Why the hell 
is this guy listening to his ex-wife anyway? Most guys dont even 
bother listening to their current wives. And, despite the Friends 
jinx, people genuinely seemed to take to this flick.
Reading about this movie got me to thinking about how well 
mafia-related projects seem to do. The Godfather, Goodfellas, and 
The Sopranos have all been fantastically popular with fans and 
critics alike. The big question now is, Why havent I made a 
movie about the mob? It shouldnt be too difficult; no special 
effects, no computer graphics, no nothing. All I need to do is find 
people with comical Italian accents who refuse to complete any 
sentence that doesnt contain at least three expletives. Have you 
ever seen Goodfellas on network TV? It takes about 10 minutes on 
account of all the dialogue they have to ax.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
Cannibal Holocaust
Sunday, September 10
Like The Whole Nine Yards, this movie has something to do with 
Italians being killed. Only this time its substantially gorier  
this flick managed to get banned in the U.K. and Australia 
because of extreme gruesomeness. In an effort to come up with 
the least cleverly worded tagline ever, the producers of Cannibal 
Holocaust came up with Those who filmed it were devoured 
alive by cannibals. Right. Its your basic flick about three Italian 
filmmakers who venture to South America to film a documen
tary about cannibals in the jungle. When a rescue crew is sum
moned to help them after they disappear, the only thing they 
find is the rolls of film they shot, which comprise the balance of 
the movie. Sound familiar?
So, clearly, you have to give this movie some credit for actually 
coming up with the idea that Blair Witch made oh-so-profitable. 
On the other hand, Cannibal Holocaust would easily make PETAs 
Ten Movies We Hate" list. Monkeys, muskrats, and sea turtles all 
meet horrible fates over the course of the flick. Id go into more 
detail about what happens to them and their human counter
parts, but youd probably hurl on the newspaper and not be able 
to read the end of my column. Which is now.
At 8 pm, 10 pm, and midnight

L8THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 5, 2000
Upcoming weekend features crafts, 
classic rock, and community artwork
PITTSBURGH, from page L12 
the film Kids at the Andy Warhol 
Museum. Its part of a new pro
gram called Good Fridays, which 
features a cash bar, free gallery 
admission, and this weeks power
ful, amazing pseudo-documentary 
about the private lives of adoles
cents where children have lost all 
innocence and adults could care 
less. All of these museum events 
take place between 5 pm and 10 
pm.
Now that were a week into the 
semester, you may find that your 
dorm room or apartment is lacking 
what the French call a certain I 
dont know what. What better 
place to fill that missing void with 
arts and crafts from an arts and 
crafts show at a monastery. The 
Fall Craft Holiday Fair will 
take place this Saturday from 10
am to 4 pm at the St. Benedict 
monastery. Get there bright and 
early for all your craft needs. Mom 
would be proud.
After youve bought your share 
of cute arts and crafts, you could 
go to your choice of interesting 
events. For all you classic rock 
fans, Allman Brothers Band gui
tarist/vocalist/non-Allman 
Dickey Betts is playing at The 
Rosebud in the Strip District at 7 
pm. If you cant afford the $35 for 
admission or if you just want to get 
local, go to Flux: An Artistic 
Community Expression at the 
future location of the Pittsburgh 
Glass Center from 8 pm until mid
night. There you will see exhibits 
from tons and tons of local artists, 
all for a measly suggested donation 
of $5.
Finally, whenever you have
some free time, be sure to check 
out the hilarious flick The Tao of 
Steve, which is playing at the 
Harris Theater in Downtown from 
Friday through September 21. Its 
about a run-of-the-mill-Joe named 
Steve who grafts the ancient 
Chinese Tao philosophy with the 
smooth personalities of famous 
dudes named Steve. Want a cool 
piece of CMU trivia? Movie legend 
and sex symbol Steve McQueen 
was a Carnegie Institute of 
Technology student once upon a 
time. Whats even more impressive 
is that he was expelled for riding 
his motorcycle through the College 
of Fine Arts building. We can add 
that name that to the long list of 
Famous People Who Went to 
CMU but Never Graduated. The 
captain of this team is still Ethan 
Hawke.

Larry Clarks compelling 1995 pseudo-documentary Kids will be shown at The Andy Warhol Museum on Friday.
September showcases dozens of 
releases from big-name artists
by Andy Francis
Assistant Arts & Living Editor
After a summer filled with teen pop and quirky 
modern rock hits, its time for the fall music season to 
hit. Around Christmas, everyone whos had a hit puts 
out some sort of best of compilation, but before that 
there are a number of big acts from all genres putting 
out new records. Heres a few of the most notable:
Rock: Radiohead - Kid A. After the phenomenal 
success of their acclaimed records The Bends and OK 
Computer, Radiohead is back with another opus. The 
band has said they didnt really know what they were 
aiming for at first with the new album, and ended up 
with what they describe as a more adventurous, exper
imental sound. Later on, the band also plans to release 
an EP of tracks left off of the new record. Also: New 
releases from Fuel, U2, Everlast, Meat Puppets, Green 
Day, and Barenaked Ladies, plus a Jimi Hendrix box 
set.
Electrnica: Fatboy Slim - Halfway Between the 
Gutter and the Stars. Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, 
made electronic music safe for America with Youve 
Come a Long Way, Baby, and now hes back with his 
third release. Cook claims the album is less pop-friendly and more like house music, which might not sit well 
with fun-loving fans. In addition to two tracks with 
Macy Gray, the first single Sunset (Bird of Prey) fea
tures vocals from legendary Doors frontman Jim 
Morrison. Also: A live disc from Bjrk and new stuff 
. from Underworld.
Pop: Madonna - Music. Still the reigning queen of 
pop music, Madonna is at it once again with this rather 
un-cleverly titled set. After her first foray into more 
electronic music, 1998s Ray of Light, proved very suc
cessful, Madonna has again chosen to go that route. 
The title track and first single pairs Madonnas vocals 
with French-sounding techno, not to mention a rather 
provocative video. Also: Look for new efforts from 
Jennifer Lopez and Pittsburghs own Christina 
Aguilera.
Hip-Hop/R&B: Wu-Tang Clan. Following their 
breakthrough 1993 record Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 
Chambers, many fans felt the Clan slipped a bit with 
the follow-up Wu-Tang Forever. The group says to 
expect more of the raw intensity of the debut record 
this time out. One problem for the Wu-Tang could be 
the continuing legal woes of group jester ODB, though 
producer/mastermind RZA says he fully expects ODB 
to contribute to the new disc, tentatively titled either 
Worms in the Big Apple or Them. Also: Rap stalwarts 
Outkast and LL Cool J drop albums this fall, as do R&B 
stars R. Kelly and Erykah Badu.

Radiohead and their fans hope that Kid A is as critically 
and commercially successful as The Bends.

Meet Blue Feats McGee (He'll Go Down In History)
by: James Kenney (email: jpkenney@andrew.cmu.edu)
I can no longer rely upon 
myself. . >
you
It's
around
like
sort
toxic plague, but worse, because 
it seems driven by a single 
insatiable desire to destroy me, 
to tear apart every strand of 
continuity that holds me 
together, that uniquely defines 
my very character, rendering me 
a quivering lump of arbitrary 
and entirely useless goo...
I shall seek outside guidance. 
Statistically speaking, the 
first person who passes by will 
give me the insight of the average populace, the modern 
yeoman, the contemporary 
proletariat.

There! I was about to say it again! I was going to say 
"arbitrarily often."

REVIVED 4 
ENTHUSIASM!
Blue Feats McGee, is a scurvy lad. His 
wit is faster than his rapier. His feats 
of strength are rivaled only by his feet, 
in that they are 4 blue shoe prints 
imprinted on the circumference of a 
white wheel, which spins on an axis 
supported solely by his giant hands.
Essentially, Blue Feats McGee, rolls 
all around on his wheel. What boggles 
me is the fact that at all times McGee is 
supporting the weight of his body with 
his arms, talk about sore shoulders.
Its like standing on a pole and picking 
yourself up by that same pole. Damn!
Restate my assumptions. 
The average human is 
roughly as intelligent as 
a walnut.
The only stance worth 
defending is the empty stance.
There's always time for 
more anime.
I'm having a problem. I can't 
find myself! I can no longer 
trust anything I do, anything 
I think, anything I feel!
You must help me! What 
do you do when you've lost 
contact with yourself?
Dude, you probably just need 
a good lay. Or maybe some 
weed. Or you could try 
Objectivism.

"Arrgh, ye scurvy lards and larses, 
beware the wrath of Blue Feats McGee,
I'll wheel over yer sorry arse and take yer 
groceries fer me own!" The cops usually 
call me and tell me I can find him passed 
out drunk in a nursing home parking lot, 
hugging a brown bag full of diapers.
I have an amazing respect for McGee, 
and in another life he could have been 
a spectacular pirate, but in this life he 
is a confused lost man who needs help. 
He is best described as a Scottish pirate 
who was thrown into a washing machine 
full of beer and had his knees broken.

Pittsburgh abuzz with music following Labor Day
DO PITTSBURGH!
by Greg NofiEntertainment Editor
Do Pittsburgh! is a new column, 
written to show that there actually 
are things to do in the Steel City. In 
fact, there are at least 120 places to 
go and events to see. With 12 issues 
of The Tartan this semester, these 
120 things will be divided into ten 
an issue. That is certainly a sizable 
chunk to provide you with an enter
taining and enlightening week. 
Details of all the events can be found 
in the Calendar section. So without 
further ado, here are 10 things to do 
this week to keep you from getting 
bored:
In case youve been living under a 
rock, Pearl Jam and Sonic 
Youth will be playing tonight at the 
Post-Gazette Pavillion at Star Lake. 
Well, it turns out that everyone on 
campus has an unskippable class 
that night. Thats all Ive been hear
ing since April: Hey, Pearl Jams 
coming! Oh, but I have class that 
night... Either way, you may hear 
Jeremy speak in class today (but not
the way he did in the song).
If youre not the grunge type but 
would rather see some hardcore skapunk, the virtual inventorsof the 
genre are coming to Oaklands Club 
Laga on Wednesday. In fact, Less 
Than Jake play in the Burgh quite 
often. Perhaps their greatest perfor
mance came three years ago when a 
lesser-known punk band from 
California opened for them. Their 
name was Blink-182. But that was 
back in the days when they actually 
played real punk rock.
Do you want to get cultured in 
theater but dont have the attention 
span for a multi-act play? Then the
2000 Pittsburgh New Works 
Festival is just the event for you. 
Its a month-long showcase present
ing a dozen original one-act plays at 
the Lester Hamburg Studio Theatre 
in South Side. The first round of 
plays take place this Thursday 
through Sunday. The three plays 
shown are Cells, Thats Amore, and 
Light.
This Friday is perhaps the biggest 
night on campus this semester. It all 
starts off at 4:30 pm on the Cut with
Stacey Tetzlaff/File Photo
Every organization on campus will be at Fridays Activities Fair. But if nothing 
else, the event is good for getting free candy and tons of colorful fliers.
the Fall Activities Fair.
Representatives from every possible 
activity you can think of from origa
mi to Ultimate Frisbee will be there 
to hand you countless numbers of 
flyers and free candy. Following the 
Activities Fair is a picnic at 6:30 with 
free food for all. After that, head
over to the CFA Lawn for a concert 
by rock group Rusted Root. Again, 
this event is free. Its all free, 
damnit!
If for some reason these Friday 
happenings dont thrill you, you can 
expand your mind with a showing of
