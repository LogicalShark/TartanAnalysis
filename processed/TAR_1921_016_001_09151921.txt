NEW GYM SITE 
UNDECIDED YET
Registration, for the first time 
since the founding of the school, 
will be held in the gymnasium op
posite the Central building. As no 
facilities for writing will be provid
ed in the registration room, all those 
desiring to register are requested to 
have the necessary forms filled ost 
completely 'before entering the gym. 
Those applicants who have not re
ceived their registration blanks and 
permits by mail, are urged to re
port to the. office of the registrar, 
before rporting to th gym. This 
was the information given out by 
Mr. Brights office, where the state
ment , also emanated that more stu
dents than ever before would be 
candidates for admission to th4 va
rious Colleges of the Institute, as 
the Divisions are called. Since 
there r many more applicants than I 
can be handled comfortably by the 
Colleges it is probable that the per
sonal interview will be used to cut1 
down the number of students ad-1 
mitted to a workable figure. It is 
estimated that the total of day and 
night students will reach the fourthousand mark.
Some of the developments of the 
.summer were the changing of the 
names of the Divisions to Colleges, 
the formation of the Division of Co
operative Research, Dr. Bingham, di
rector, which grew out of the Divi
sion of Applied Psychology, and the 
grouping of the Night, Summer and 
short courses under/ the Division of 
Night-Summer-and Short Vocational 
courses .with. Dr. .31..,M. Ihrjg-as -di
rector. The Division of Academic 
Studies will now be known as the 
Division of General Studies, and Di
rector Morris of the Division of the 
Industries will be Associate Director 
Morris.
One of the interesting facts re
vealed by last .years registration, 
and one that is not thoroughly ap
preciated by the student body .is the 
large territory from which the stu
dente attending Tech are drawn. Ac
cording to the figures of last Sep
tember, every county in the State 
of Pennsylvania except one, fortysix States of the Union, and twentyseven foreign countries were repre
sented at Tech by regularly enrolled 
students. A record such as this is 
truly marvelous for a school scarce
ly fifteen years old, the more so 
when one considers the steady man
ner in which tuition rates for regu
lar students have increased in the 
last four years.
Five Locations Under Con
sidrt on. Decisions 
Expected Soon
The new gymnasium is still more 
or less an unknown factor. A com
mittee has been studying buildings 
of this type and will soon have a 
definite solution. It is a big problem 
because what we build now must 
be adequate to meet the needs of 
the schools in the future. Consider
ation is given co the future enroll
ment, the kind and extent of ath
letics and physical training. The lo
cation is an unsolved, problem, for 
it must be sosituated as to be con
venient. for all ..studentsthat is if 
we are to have physical work for 
everyone; the building must be cen
trally located so tbat tlie students 
can get to and from classes in the 
least possible time. Also If we are 
to have a stadium It may be a'good 
plan to iiave the two athletic struct
ures .close together.
Five sites are under consideration. 
They are: The corner of Forbes and
Woodlawn, the location of the pres
ent grandstand, the Margaret Mor
rison School, the vacant land ad* 
poining the art school on the east, 
and the last site is that of Forbes 
Hall. The advantages of these va
rious' -3Liesarc being studied by a 
special committee and no place will 
be selected' until it has been proven 
the best for future needs of Carne
gie.
HOSPITIALITY HOUSE 
OPEN TO STUDENTS
Do you know about the Hospitality 
House? It is' situated at 4246 Fifth 
avenue and lias gradually changed 
from the Hostess House of the war to 
a Community House for students.
The house itself has a fine large 
porch, splendid lawns and a homely 
big living room, whore the lonely girl 
or man student will find people to 
meet and talk to and where you may 
study, read or play as you /Choose. 
Many sorority and fraternity meetings 
are held at the house. If you visit 
you willsee lots of your daily asso
ciates in the cafeteria.

Cabinet will determine and develop 
a social and religious program of 
mee^t the needs of the Student Body. 
Every loyal Tech man should get 
behind this movement and help to 
make it progress anu grow in the 
most useful and helpful directions.
The following program hiis been 
arranged for the opening days of

BURYING THE 
HATCHET-SAT.
Hostilities End Saturday 
NightOld Tradition
Burying the Hatchet, which is one 
of the oldest tradition at Tech, will 
occur this year as usual on the ath
letic field at 8:30 p. m Saturday, the 
17th. This Indian festival was orig
inally written by Mr. Stevens and has 
been produced at Tech every year. It 
is very significant to the Plebes as it 
terminates the hostilities between 
them and the ruling 'Sophomores.
The cast of characters has not been 
determined as yet. The important 
characters are the Senior chief, the 
Sophomore chief, and Plebe chief and 
the four chieftains. The four chief
tains signify the North, East, 'South 
and West, and in the play they will 
represent the four colleges of the in
stitution. Jack Williard is the direc
tor of the pageant this> year and every 
thing indicates that it wiiK.be very 
successful.
This festival gives the Plebes their 
first opportunity to show,their spirit 
Fifty Plebes are wanted to take part 
in it and all those who can possibly 
do so are asked to meet on the ath
letic field at 1:30 Saturday. If you 
are a Plebe and cannot take part in 
it, be sure to be present at 8:30 p. m. 
Saturday because it will be to your 
advantage. All stiidertts and their 
friends are cordially invited and the 
upper classmen are also urged to be 
present.
Start the year off right by attend
ing this festival and Plebes see that 
the Sophs Bury the Hatchet."
M. M. D. ALUMNAE
SCHOLARSHIP DANCE
The Margaret Morrison Alumnae 
having achieved such a success with 
their Athletic Scholarship Dance of 
last year, have decided to inaugurate 
a similar dance . to take place on 
the night of the first football game 
which will be against Thiel College 
on September 24. The money that 
is obtained as the result of this 
dance will be used as was the case 
last year to provide scholarships for 
the most needy of the Tech athletes 
those favored being selected on the 
basis of scholarship, activity and 
need. The dance last year which 
was very successful completely filled 
the Union and in order to take care 
of the bigger crowd that is expected 
this year, it is planned that several 
dances will be given simultaneously, 
making use of the Union, the Arts 
Foyer and perhaps the Langley Lab
oratory.
Considerable interest has been 
.shown among the Alumni who are 
familiar with, the preparations and 
the affair promises, in view of the 
fact that it will be the first large 
dance of the school year, to be one 
of the biggest ever staged on the 
campus.
Ticket will be sold for $1.50 and 
can be obtained from Miss Stewart 
of the Alumni office or mtmbers of 
the committee.
PENN STATE
EXCURSION
Whathol Whereaway? Every
body aboard? When the Penn 
State Special" leaves Pitts
burgh for the Tech-Penn State 
 game It ought to carry the lar
gest crowd of Tech people ever 
visiting a game played on a for
eign field.
What is this, newcomers may 
ask, how can I get there, when 
is Jt? Here is the dope, answer
ing all questions which may 
come up:
November fifth, the Carnegie 
eleven will stack up against the 
strong Pennsylvania State Col
lege football team on the latters field. In prder that the 
Tech people may see this im
portant game It has been decid
ed to run an excursion for this 
purpose. Anybody at Tech may 
go, and a record crowd is looked 
for.
The price may seem prohibi
tive to some. An easy matter 
to remedy! On registration 
day, let everyone buy a folder 
and a stamp, which will be on 
sale at that time, for this trip. 
These folders will have room to 
contain 56 twenty-five cent 
stamps which may be purchased 
at any time, at several agencies 
on the campus, including the 
cashier's office. When these 
Penn State folders are filled, 
they entitle the holder to a 
round trip ticket aboard the 
Tech special train, to the game. 
Is this not a simple and econom
ical solution of the expense 
problem?
Certainly no better plan than 
this could be devised, whereby 
every student at Tech may go. 
Ask anyone who went to the 
Bethany game, at Wheeling last 
year, if they had a good time. 
It's a sure bet that everyone of 
them will be along on this trip, 
too.
Dont miss the best treat of 
the season. Get your folder and 
every time you have a quarter 
without a home, just make 
tracks for the nearest stamp' 
agency and invest.
This trip will be an invest
ment which you will remember 
long after you are out of school. 
Let'3 make that the longest 
train leaving Pittsburgh, th.e 
Carnegie Tech-Penn State Lim
ited; what do we care If It takes 
a dozen engines to haul it?

LAST YEARS SQUAD INTACT
Camp Louise Carnegie, September 15.After two weeks of pain and 
Charley-liorse the Carnegie Tech football team will be practicing on Tech 
Field. The squad came through the preliminary work-outs at Camp Louise 
Carnegie with the minimum amount of injuries, and is, even now, in good 
shape for the opening game with Thiel College on September 24, at Tech 
Field. So, it is entirely safe to predict that by the time for the referee's 
whistle the team will be in fine shape, and ready to wade through the season 
with a perfect record.
Prospects for a great team are far brighter than at any previous time. 
There are more letter men back to slip on the harness and gears; there is
much greater array of promising 
pTnprp TT?QT?Q material from* the high schools, and
HA 1 JL X VyU ZINGZRE on top of this, the training period is
ULU /fp T *ong enough to get the men into goodUUlVJLh 1U iJbCli condition.
Of last years team, the entire 
squad is back with the sole exception 
of Itog" Marshall, and ho would bo, 
back if it were not for the injury to 
his shoulder suffered during the 
Washington & Jefferson game last 
season. His physician adviser order
ed him to drop football this season, 
and for that reason alone, he is not 
back. This augers well for tlio future 
of Carnegie Tech football. Among 
thoso present, are Captain Al Irwin, 
Rod Godden, last -years captain; 
"Gy Comfort, "Skitch Henderson, 
"Al Wierman, Pittman, Rosonbloom, 
Sprinkle, liable, McCloan, Wittmor, 
Grlllln, Robertson, Brumbaugh and 
Taylor. Thoso men make a splondld 
nucleus around whom Coach "Wally 
Stollon can build a team. Captain Ir
win, while the lightest man on tho 
squad, proved, himself to be a born 
ieador and tighter, by the convincing 
manner In which he, led tho team dur
ing the time Godden was occupying 
tho bench with injuries. TO a center, 
Captain Irwin has very few equals. 
Ho is notod for his coolness when un
der lire, and for his ability to diag
nose his opponentsplay, and thereby 
break them up. In former! Captain 
Godden, Tech has as fine an end as 
could be wished for, combining spend 
with enthusiasm born from courage 
and light. Godden played In the baolctlold last year, but with the largo

stars, always in tho midst of tho light, 
and ever shouldering a groat parti of 
the burden of opening up holes 
through which the backs plunge for 
neat gains. . Henderson, at guard, 
proved to bo a staunch supporter of 
liis position, and worked wonderfully 
on both dot'enso and offense. Roson
bloom, transplanted last season from 
BueknOll, was a demon on both de
fense and offense, always showing tho 
courage, stamina, and fight of true 
Tech men. Sprinkle, tho big tackle,

of the triangular enclosure were built in the year that 
Columbus discovered America. Much of the history of 
Russia a dark tale of intrigue, mystery and bloodshed

The present Great Palace dates back only to Napoleons

Otis Automatic Push Hutton Elevators in the Great Palace. 
There is anodier Otis Elevator in the Nicholas Palace. 
This is significant of the world-wide scope of Otis activi

About forty-five men, candidates 
for the 1921 football team are at 
Camp Louise Carnegie. Most of the 
boys came Sunday, September 4. 
and commenced practicing Monday 
morning. This is the location of 
the School Engineering camp at 
Glencairu, Pa., about twenty-five 
miles from the city. This is an ideal 
place for football training because 
there is a. good practice field and 
a five-mile road for cross-country. 
Also adjacent to the Allegheny liver. 
The men are housed in the old man
sion which is a large house accom
modating fifty to sixty men. In the

A CARNEGIE EIGHT
The Tennis Club was organized for 
the sole purpose of maintaining the 
tennis courts and equipment, as well 
as for the purpose of developing var
sity tennis material.
If you are a tennis player, join the 
[ club so as to assure the success of 
this t organization. . The membership 
fee for the season ending June 15,
1922, is $2.00, whether you join now 
lor next May. Get in early.
The fee of members picked for the 
[varsity squad will be refunded when 
; the squad is picked.
REMEMBER:
Only students regularly enrolled are 
| eligible for the club.
All persons using the courts must 
be club members.
j Students not members found using 
the courts will be recommended for 
disciplinary action.
Membership cards of players must 
[be shown to the caretaker or mem[ bers of the tennis committee upon 
j demand.
j Membership cards may be had at 
the cashiers office on and after Sep
tember 19, upon payment of the fee.
A sport lacking at Tech, so very popular at other colleges, is rowing. 
Can there be any more exciting contests than those small, trim craft, manned 
by the husky crews of rival schools, flying over the water? The person who 
has witnessed such races claims not even football can surpass it.
Rowing is a major sport at all colleges having teams, great efforts being 
made to produce good crews, as much stress being placed on this as on the 
football and other major sport teams.
With Pittsburgh so admirably situated on the rivers, it seems the facili
ties for the development of a crew at Carnegie are most convenient. This 
suggestion may seem rather premature, but in order to produce a crew for 
the spring, training for the'entire winter would be necessary.
Isnt it.possible for Tech to expand her athletic program and include in 
it, a regatta either in Pittsburgh or Techs entry in the annual Poughkeepsie ?
THE NEW GYMNASIUM
In a short time the ground for the new gymnasium will be broken. This 
will start the fulfillment of the dreams of all Techites, who have realized, 
that to be highly successful in athletics, a gymnasium vastly superior to the 
present one must be available.
The gift of the Carnegie Corporation of $400,000 for this purpose is the 
realization of the efforts of several years of those interested in the develop
ment of better athletics at Carnegie. The gymnasium which this sum will 
build will be far superior to the gymnasiums of other colleges, something of 
which Tech may be justly proud.
This will mean that the attendance at basket ball games will not be 
limited, due to lack of sufficient space to accommodate all spectators. The 
swimming pool will assure Tech of a team in that sport in the future, an
other great source of satisfaction.
A bright future in these sports is bound to prevail, thanks to the new 
gym. __________________________

DUES PAYABLE IN OCTOBERTAU BETA PI DELEGATES
Owing to Iho changes made in .the 
Constitution of the Alu'mni Federa
tion, it will be necessary to revise 
the Constitution of our own associa
tion in order that it may not conflict 
with that of the Federation.
Under the now Federation Constitu
tion, the dues have been increased 
from $1.00 to .$1.25, of which amount 
$1.00 is for ALUMNUS expense and 
the balance, 25c, for Federation over
head. As the duos in the Margaret 
Morrison Association are now only 
$1.50,, tiiis would mean that only 25c 
would be available for running the 
affairs of our own association after 
paying $1.25 to the Federation. There
fore, at our October business meeting, 
the question of increasing our dues to 
$2.00 will be voted upon.
Until definite action lias been taken, 
no bills for dues will be sent out to 
Margaret Morrison members. When 
the question has been decided, the 
bills will be mailed from the Alumni 
oflice and all checks should be made 
payable to G. L. Tiibrook, Treasurer 
of the Alumni Federation. The Fed
eration office will at the proper time 
remit to the Margaret Morrison treas
ury its share of the amount collected.
WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE ALL

WOODROW WILSON FOUNDATION
New York, Sept. 15.A committee 
of college presidents, and professors 
is to be one of the major groups to 
assist in' the work of the Woodrow 
Wilson Foundation, according to an 
announcement just given out from 
the headquarters of that organization 
at 150 Nassau street, New York. 
Hamilton Holt, editor of the Inde
pendent and executive director of 
the foundation, announced that 
Stephen P. Duggan, director o the 
Institute of International Education 
of New York is to be chairman of 
what is to be called the Educational 
Committee of the Foundation and 
that Professor Duggan has already 
outlined his committee and is re
ceiving,' acceptances 4for membership 
on lit.
It is the hope of the Woodrow 
Wilson (Foundation to rally to its 
support the largest possible body of 
college graduates and undergrad uatos, says Mr. Holt's statement. The 
purpose of the foundation is to hon
or and perpetuate the ideals of Mr. 
'Wilson, and .to use the words defin
ing its purpose, it. is ,to be created 
by public subscription in recognition 
of. the national and international 
services of Woodrow Wilson, twice 
President of the United States, who 
furthered the cause of human free
dom and was instrumental in point
ing out effective methods for the'co
operation of the liberal forces of 
mankind throughout the world.
The Award or Awards from the 
income of the foundation will be 
made from time to time by a nation
ally constituted committee to the in
dividual or group that has rendered, 
within a specified period, meritorious 
service to democracy, public wel
fare, liberal thought or peace through 
justice.
It is proposedto give the founda
tion an endowment of one million 
dollars or more, to be subscribed as 
a free-will offering from all parts of 
the country and firom all classes-, of 
its people, the sum to, be kept, per
manently intact and the income' to 
be used as an award or awards 
somewhat like the Nobel prizes, 
one of which Mr. Wilson, himself, 
holds. The money is to be raised 
without the usual campaign or 
drive methods, since the committee 
feels that such a means of moneyraising in 1liis instance will be un
necessary so long as their purpose 
is only to afford Americans an op
portunity to pay tribute in lasting 
form to the democratic ideals of an
other American who served his 
country and the world, and who 
achieved greatly and suffered great
ly.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, President 
Wilson's assistant secretary of the 
Navy, is. chairman of the National 
Committee of the Foundation, and 
Cleveland li. Dodge is chairman'of 
tlio Executive Committee, which is 
composod of the following members: 
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Frank I. 
Cobb, Stephen P. Duggan, Mrs. J. 
Malcolm Forbes, Edwin F. Gay, Mrs. 
J. Bordon Harriman, Edward M. 
House, Frederick Lynch, Henry Morgentliau, Adolph S. Ochs, Frank L.

Caroline Ruutz-Rees, Mrs. Charles E.

and Mrs. H. Otto Wittpenn.

PLAID SQUAD LOOKS GOOD
(Continued From ' Page One.) 
Kiski; Szold, Gary, Indiana; Phillip 
White, Washington, Pa., and Fleahman, Martins Ferry, Pa.
Quite a number of thesei men have 
already shown promise of developing 
into great football men. There are 
men such as Ave, weighing 220 
pounds; Moessner, 210 pounds, and 
Newman, Alexander, Mills, Calabish 
and Byers, eadh weighing over 190 
pounds. Lewis and Newman are 
showing up as' good punters, and 
ought to carry the burden of that de
partment of the game in a most cred
itable style. In Sawyer, Gove, Dix 
and Ford we have a nice lot of fast 
backs, while such men as Moessner 
shoulddevelop into a great battering 
ram for gains through the line and 
off tackle.
All in all, the team seems to have 
wonderful prospects, and there is no 
reason at all why the results should 
not be such as to promote the great
est enthusiasm.

CLAN NEWS
PITTSBURGH CLAN
The first after the holiday luncheon 
was held last Thursday in the Assem
bly rdom of the Fort Pitt Hotel with 
lots o Tech pep made possible by 
45 loyal sons and daughters. - It was 
indeed a great beginning and prom
ises to be the big year for the Clan.
President DeMuth opened the meet
ing with a short talk to the members 
present from the 1921 class. Secre
tary Batman gave a brief outline of 
the work for the coming year and 
emphasized the necessity for true 
Tech co-operation. Alumni Secretary 
Tiibrook made a survey of the Alumni 
standing at the present time, showing 
that it was necessary for every clans
man to get on the job and,enlist every 
member possible. Mr. Tiibrook fur
ther stated that the Federation must 
have 2,500 members this year. If YOU 
help, it can be done.
Graduate Manager Haaren then ap
proached the subject of football, 
which was received with much ap
plause. After a few~remarks for the 
coming season, Mr. Haaren introduced 
"Bob Waddell, assistant football 
coach and former Peabody High 
School and Buclcnell star. Bob 
stated that Wally Steffen was a 
mighty busy man at camp and ex
pressed regrets that he could not be 
at ftie luncheon. Bob then gave a 
survey of happenings at the football 
camp and from what we heard, it is 
going to be, Watch Tech when we 
play Penn State and W. & J.
It can be safely said that the Pitts
burgh Clan is-going to be a near 100 
per cent organization this year from 
the demonstration of last Thursday.
Lets continue the good work and 
have a full house for the October 
luncheon.
LETS GO, CLANS!
We have a goal to reach, so begin 
now.
What promises to be the greatest 
year in the history of Tech is just 
beginning, and it is up to every clan 
to get on the job and make it the 
greatest year from an Alumni standpoint.
Tech Clans are our only agents 
through which we can success
fully reach our Alumni* out of the 
Pittsburgh district, and are, therefore, 
among our most / important organiza
tions. However, we cannot work effi
ciently until every clan is willing to 
add its working power to the great 
machine and help keep the portion of 
our Alumni that is scattered 
ganized.
In order to expect quick results, it 
is very important that you get your 
members together at once, and start 
operations for the coming year. The 
member lists of the various clans are 
now being checked in the Alumni of
fice and will be forwarded to you 
within two weeks.' However, do not 
let this list keep you from< getting to
gether now.
Just as a reminder, Techs greatest 
prospective football team is now In 
camp and it is up to every one of YOU 
to watch every move. Your interest 
muSt be with the team and we hope 
that many of the Clansmen can be 
on deck for some of the games.
GET ON THE JOB! Pay your $2.00 
dues and be entitled to all the privi
leges of an Alumni member. Start 
the year right and you will have no 
worry for the future.
The Clan directory will appear in 
an early issue of the Tartan.

Alumni, have you yet considered 
your responsibilities to Tech?
Then this is your cue to get busy.
The Carnegie Corporation and 
Board of Trustees have done their 
bit; they have assured Techs future 
for. years, as well as made our fond
est dream a realitythe gym. At the 
present time, plans are being prepar
ed and the final details of this struc
ture are being worked out.
Some of the problems which Tech 
Alumni have been called upon to help 
solve are:
1. In what manner should the Fu
ture Tech develop in its vari
ous departments, Athletic, Edu
cational, Activities, Financial, 
etc.
2. What location seems most desir- able for the new gymnasium?
3. Does a combined gymnasium and 
stadium seem feasible?
4. If activities other than athletic 
should be given room in the new 
gymnasium, which should 
taken in?
5. What type of building would 
you consider as more nearly 
meeting these requirements?
Get active in this alumni work and 
repay the debt you owe our Founder 
and Benefactor by helping to carry on 
the work he left in trust with you. 
a real factor in Techs upbuildingwe 
want your support, your ideas and 
opinions in all of-this work.
There are about 2,500 graduates 
who should be back of Tech. Of this 
number less than 50 per cent were in 
good standing in' the Alumni Federa
tion last year. In addition, about 10,- 
000' former students are eligible for 
associate membership. Notwithstand
ing this, thejotal paid up membership 
for the year 1920-1921 was 1,392.
WE MUST HAVE YOUR SUP
PORT.
2,500 OR BUST FOR 1921-1922 is 
our slogan.
The dues are but $2.00 (whether 
paid now or next May) for the year 
ending June 30, 1922. Join now and 
receive the Tartan weekly in addition 
to the Alumnus. You owe it to Tech 
as well as to yourself to join at onceFollow the athletic teams in person, 
if you are in the Pittsburgh district 
and through the columns of tlie Tar
tan if you are out of town.
Do not act as though you were 
ashamed of your schooltalk Tech all 
the time. Write your old schoolmates 
and see that they are active. Above 
all, get back to the campus at every 
opportunity. Plan now to be with us 
next May for Campus Week.
