Crowded to its maximum capacity 
the Union, Saturday was the scent; 
of Tech spirit at its highest. Ming
ling among the students boys, were 
a group of very loyal girls, who add
ed a realization of Carnegie Tech 
as our school. The Alumni headed 
by the band marched over from 
their banquet and these three groups 
joining together in their exaltation, 
arid with the aid of Buddy Over
end and several entertainments 
marked it a night, memorable to 
Carnegie Tech.
Coach Steffens expressed his re
gret at leaving, but promised he 
would be back in the spring to get 
next years team started. Compli
menting the team for their loyal tv 
and whole heartedness, in their work, 
also in their loyalty to him, he ex
pressed his farewell to the team in 
a way that menat more than coach 
and trainer, but as pal to pal.
Al. Irwin, he said was one of the 
most unusual players he'd ever seen 
for his size, and was pleased that 
the men had chosen him as nexl 
years captain. He also classed Cy 
Comfort as an All-American, possi
bility for next year.
Coach Iddings said a few words 
about the Plebe team and the com
ing basketball season. Duke Casey, 
president elect of the Varsity Clan 
said the Clan would co-operate any
thing that the athletic authorities 
asked.
Buddy" Overend opened up on 
the spirit of the girls and said it 
was the best thing hed ever seen 
in his carrer. Buddy" said he had 
helped Andy and Hanning found the 
school and the team, was the best 
ever in the school history. In a few 
words direct to the team lie said 
he wanted them back next year, ami 
that every help that they rendered 
would be given them.
The crowd then adjourned to the 
faculty club room, the girls goins 
out first under one arch, formed by 
out-stretched arms of their admirers.
Kid Clark of Culver fame and Bat
tling Red Carmin went five minutes 
for a no fall decision. Both of these 
boys worked hard, and gave a good 
exhibition. Micked Donovan offici
ated. Sampson and Deliah a Good
rich production, depicted the fa
mous story in a burlesque manner 
was well met.
The East Liberty A. A. furnished 
two boxers, who went three rounds 
of three minutes each in some fast 
battling. The fight was good, but 
it didn't last long enough. Follow
ing this the male Hula dancer, twis
ted and turned and shooked, did a 
little Frisco and then some Oriental.
Following this, well well let that 
stand.

Saturday night Tech campus was 
the scene of an unusual demonstra
tion by the women students. Ru
mors were current that pep was 
lacking in their make-up, but they 
proved that it was a dominent qual
ity. The wonderful results of the 
game had its effect on everybody. 
We know how Tech and W. & .1. 
felt about it, but few knew how the 
other half of Tech" took the 6-0.
The' idea originated in tho Mellon 
Hall and the parade started from 
there. In formation a la snake, tin; 
lassies circled up Forbes and down 
Woodlawn, The line increased with 
every step and the singing grew 
louder as they traveled toward their 
goalthe Varsity Clan Banquet.
When they reached the beanery, 
their nerve failed them; they got 
stage fright or something similar 
because it was an, unheard of thing 
to enter a Varsity Clan Banquet: A 
few brave ones, however, rallied 
around the gang and led . them in. 
Whe they entered, the old pep re
vived and the beanery rocked with 
their cheers and yells.
The girls were invited -to attend 
the smoker (also an unheard of 
thing). Because of the enthusiasm 
of Dean Scales and her loyal Tech. 
spirit, they were permitted to ac
cept the invitation. Consequently, 
an hour later, members of all' the

to everlasting fame, and glory last 
Saturday when they rose out of the

victory marks the opening of a new 
era in Plaid athletics, being tin; .first 
time in the history of the school 1

recognized first rank on the gridiron
The glorious and sensational event 
happened shortly after the begin
ning of the fourth period, and th<> 
wild cheering and pandemonium that 
broke loose during the few seconds 
the play was being enacted and for 
ten minutes thereafter has never 
been witnessed before on Tech field, 
The ball wu.v in W. it Jpc'3:,.cr..,.:n

ickson dropped back to punt. He was 
slow in handling the ball and before 
he could get it away Comfort was 
.in front of him and blocked tlu; kick. 
The ball fell directly in front of 
McCIean, who had been at Comfort's 
side, and he scooped it up out of 
the slime and raced across the Pres
idents goal line. He covered just 
16 yards for the greatest run in his
tory. Other Tech men have made 
longer and more spectacular dashes 
to their opponents goal, but they 
had never meant victory for the 
Plaid. Yells and cheers came from 
the stands, while gathered around 
McCIean between the posts stood 
Steffen's crew hugging and kissing 
cach other in a delirium of joy.
It was a full minute before Mc
CIean could get away, then CyV 
Comfort tried to boot the soggy ball 
between the uprights, but had be
come so unnerved and excited that, 
'the ball skidded along the ground 
where it was easily stopped by the 
W. & J. men. "Cy was so disap
pointed at this error on his part 
that he wept as he walked back 
down the< field, showing how the 
Tartans were fighting for their hard 
earned victory.
Except for the first few minutes 
of play when their old stage fright 
seemed to grip them, the Plaid war
riors out-played the Morrow ma
chine. The field was covered with a 
slimy mud to a depth of six inches, 
while the. weather was ideal. Bat
tling in this muck the Tartans held
their heavier opponents scoreless for 
three periods, until they made their 
own break" and were on the job 
!to take advantage of it to tho full

McCIean will get the lion's share 
jo? the credit for the victory, but the 
whole team without exception de
serves the highest praise. They all 
worked like a well oiled machine, 
'each individual performing his part 
'to the fullest.' extent of his ability 
and showing to the last man that 
fight and grim determination which 
brought them out on the top side 
of the score. In addition to McCIean 
some of tho 'other men on the team

Viewpoint. jimmy Robertson was 
One of these, who brought the Tech 
stands to their leet and put life in
to his team mates by tearing off 
several large gains. He was put into 
the game in Pittmans place in the 
second quarter;-and taking the ball 
on the first play ran thru the whole 
vV. & J. team for a gain of 27 yards. 
A slippery mud hole was his undo
ing or he would have gone through 
for a touchdown. Twice again he 
hit the line carrying the ball to the 
five yard line. Here Tech only able 
to try two plays, both of which 
failed, .before the whistle ending 
the first half blew. During the sec
ond period he distinguished himself 
by returning two punts, one for 2i. 
and the other* for 12 yards.

ling the team in good fashion Wierrrtan deserved his share of the cred
it. The muddy condition of the field 
was a great handicap to him and he 
was able to get away only Mice for 
one of his end runs which has made 
him famous throughout the season.

For PresidentWally Steffens
The annual Varsity Clan banquet 
held in the cafeteria Saturday night 
after the \\\ it J. game was by far 
the most brilliant and successful 
ever given to a Tech Football team. 
It had a perfect right to be. because 
it was the culmination of the most 
successful football season in tho 
school's history. There was never u 
dull moment from tho time the al 
fair commenced until President Ov 
erend's closing remarks, and that fa
mous Tech spirit was manifested 
throughout.
"Speedy" Rush, was the premier 
speaker of the occasion and deliver
ed himself of an oration high in its 
praise of the Plaid team and its 
coaclv, Walter Steffen, lie said he 
had heard much of Techs spirit and 
Coach before coming to Pittsburgh, 
but hadn't realized until ho saw 
them how great they were. "Block
ing a punt is not 1 break in the 
game," he declared, but something 
that has to bo planned and the men 
on tho team coached how to turn 
tin' trick. .Heating a team of the 
.''cHbve of W. & J, unib'i any e 'edi 
tions is a mighty dil'fieuli font. I 
hear that Mr, Steffen Is something 
of a politician in Chicago, and I am 
going to propose him for tho high
est political job in the land, I'res
ident of the United States.
Coach Steffen who shared the he
ro's place with McCIean all evening 
was next to speak, and after being 
introduced by Toastmaster Ovorond 
as the best coach in tho world, he 
began his talk relating how lie luid 
exhorted the team to light, in this 
game every chance he had for sever
al days up to the time of play. "I 
am mighty proud of this year's team, 
and delighted .with the way they 
have come through the season. In 
all my experience as a coach I have 
never had a bunch of men who wore 
harder workers, and more willing to 
go out on the field and fight to the 
limit of their ability. I could see 
in the first half of the game that 
the men were in there to fight until 
they won,-and it was only VV. it J.s 
good fortune that wo did not score 
upon them in the first half. Between 
halves I did not need to talk to the 
boys to make them go out and con
tinue the fight, but could see in 
their attitude that they were eager 
and impatient to get out on the 
field and continue the game.
"I hope every one of the men on 
this years team will be back next 
year. If they return we can begin 
where we left off this year and con
tinue to develop a winning team, 
This .year I had to spend a great 
deal of time in teaching the men 
fundamentals of the game and could 
not develop plays we had to their 
fullest extent. I am sorry I have to 
leave for Chicago tonight and cap'1,

the country appears well for our

IN RETROSPECT
The Washington and Jefferson victory marked the close of the 1920 
football schedule and the temporary cessation of athletic activities. The 
season has not been one of uumixed glory; nevertheless both team and 
supporters acquitted themselves creditably.J.o the Plaid Gridders, who have so well carried the spirit of Carnegie 
Tech through every contest of a heavy schedule, the Tartan, in behalf 
ol the student body, extends its heartiest appreciation and gratitude. 
The lot ol a football man is not anoasy one. His task, is one ol sellsacrifice and hard work; born of a desire to give of his best, and sus
tained by supreme loyalty to his Alma Mater. His reward is practically 
negligabie, lor very lew ever ruceivu recognition commensurate with the 
effort put forth.It is the spirit of battling for a principle, not for any selfish gain, that 
makes l'ootoall the groat American game mat it is. Baseball lias been dealt a 
blow from which it will not soon recover by the exposures ol' last 
summer, but to the mind of the football spectator never comes the 
thought of sucJi possibility with regard to his lavorite sport.
The example ol' loyalty and seli-sacriiicc which each member of the 
team holds up to his associates 111 Tech is one which all of us would do 
well to keep in mind and emulate.

INDUSTRIES INTERESTS
Industries Assembly
Industries held their weekly as
sembly last Wednesday. Coach Stef
fens was the first speaker and 
stated that out of the fifteen men 
who earned their foot-ball letter 
this year, nine were Industries men. 
Every man on the squad should be 
back next year, as none are seniors. 
Plans are under way to make the gym 
a model training house. From all 
appearances next year should be a 
banner year in foot-ball.
President Hammerschlag came to 
the assembly direct from the teach
er's meeting. He said three phases 
of life must be considered,general 
study and honest application on the 
part of the student. "Get into the 
game, anytime, anywhere.
Wolters announced that the rifle 
club will shoot three times a week, 
at the 18U1. Regiment Armory.
A three school central regulation 
committee has been appointed. This 
board is composed of a Senior from 
each of the Schools. The object is 
to see that the Plebes get their just 
punishment in the future.
P. D. Good stated that the Athlet
ic Council authorized him to le'1, the Rifle Club to go ahoad with 
their plans. The council will take 
action at a later date. P. D. further 
said that all who liked to shooL 
should go right ahead) as he could 
do a little in that line, himself,
NEW PLEBE RULING
A mooting of the Sophomore Class 
was held Friday, noon. President 
Fisher gave a short talk on the len
iency of Sophs toward Plebes in the 
past. He ' urged that the Sophs 
should give the Plebes a little more 
consideration. The Sophs, being al
ways efficient, devised a new nile 
to care for "all" the Plebes. Each 
man in the Sophomore class was 
given the names of throe or four 
Plebes, to keep tab on every day. 
In this way none of the Plebes can 
get beyond control. Another rule 
was also devised prohibiting the 
Plebe from carrying a civilian hat, 
or a cap besides his Plobe hat. "Woe 
be unto those who do so. These 
rules are in effect all times and are 
a part of "Freshman Regulations."

Tech girls will have a varsity 
Basket Ball team. Such was the 
good news that reached the writer 
for at last the co-eds arc not only 
with us but are also out to do 
something big for Tech. This has 
come about as a direct result of 
the new Athletic Association, of the 
activity of Dean Scales and finally 
of the general pep and real Tech 
spirit so in evidence this year among 
the othre half of Tech.
The new Athletic Association 
opened a drive for membership last 
week, both in Design a nd Margaret 
Morrison and will continue through
out this week. A creditable number 
from both schools have joined and 
the present outlook is towards a 
large membership.

"fondly embracingdont get ex
cited nowthe loving cup offered 
by Mrs, Alderdyce is also forstalled 
'till springtime.
In the meanwhile the closing of 
the foot-ball season has turned the 
attention of the girls to the mould-, 
ing of a first class basket ball team 
Last year inter-class contests were 
held within the division of Margaret 
Morrison and as a result the Junior 
Class team won the championship. 
The team was composed of Misses 
I. Winner, II. Reed, Gene Aiken, M. 
Smith, 1!. Frost, M. Sn.il 1. It is prob
able that these six will make a 
strong bid for a position on the var
sity team, llwcver with the partiocipation of Design there will bo 
others eager for a place on the 
team and competition will be keen. 
Misses Ilulda Garaweldy and F. Bur
roughs are both experienced players 
and will strive hadr to repescnt De
sign on the team.
The schedule has not as yet been 
completed. A little sparrow flew 
down from Pitt Hill and informed 
the scribe that Pitt was anxious for 
a game and so arc wo all but Ath
letic relations have not as yet been 
resumed so the chances there are 
still doubtful. Heres hoping some 
fixes things up and lots give the 
girls the honor of handing Pitt the 
firts. Anyhow' theyll do their best 
and Pitt may have to travel the 
same road that W. & J. is jiow trav
ersing.
A contest with the Pennsylvania 
College for Women is assured and 
there Tech will run up against a 
strong team. P_ C. W. has all her 
letter "women" back and promises 
to put up an "interesting" battle.
All games will be played at home 
and we hope that all Tech may at
tend. The support of'the first half 
of Tech" is assured for with the new 
spirit shown by the co-eds the best 
wishes of all for a successful season 
will be with them.

Tech Students on Rampage
Wild Eyed Tech Men Exceed | BASKETBALLERS ATTEMPT Mardi Gras-Armistice Day m N. Y.
Monday Morning One of Greatest in Tech History. 
Plaid Followers Set Precedent in Pittsburgh 
by Celebration.
Co-eds Play Big Sister
Say you aint heard nothingyet! 
Ive seen a New Orleans Mardi Gras 
and I saw New York on Armistice 
Day but the greatest celebration 1 
ever laid eyes on was that of Mon
daya la Tech. Spirit was high on 
Saturday but it remained for Mon
day to bring forth the real pep of 
Tech when everyone wanted to show 
that he was from Tech! Heres 
h6w it all happened.
Officially it was announced Sun
day evening that classes would cease, 
at 12:30 the following day, but un
officially and on the Q. T. we all 
had a different idea about things. 
Everyone started for their usual 8:30 
all prepared, not in the usual sense 
but prepared to make that class a 
thing to be forgotten and not to be 
achieved. A handful of Plebes had 
qerve enough to invade the sombre 
halls of Science and therein they 
counted the score. As they emerged 
a small band of uppers" entered 
and, armed with a pair of husky, 
by now well trained lungs, a few 
dish pans and other "band imple
ments, they duplicated the perfor
mance of the Plebes in every cor
ridor. It was no use, classes had to 
be dismissed and any delinquent 
Prof. found himself taking to the air. 
Here's where we take our hats off 
to Prof. Goeckler for it is rumored 
that he had his door locked.
With added numbers the next 
place invaded was Industries where 
the small army of Bolshevists was 
joined by additional band members 
and students of yesterday and to
morrow, but Tech men of to-day. 
Design school was third on the list 
and not a minutes peace was given 
to those hovering over drafting 
board and easle until they too had 
joined the pee-rade. Then! Then! 
"Maggie Murpli next" was all that 
could be heard and dont think we 
had the slightest hesitation about 
going there. Here the army met its 
first oppositionno it wasnt any of 
the co-eds who opposed but just a 
harmless one historically entranced 
and armed with the most terrible, 
weapon Thou shall not pass! Even 
that plus a swinging door proved 
a small barrier to a dish pan and a 
horn and once within the rest was 
easy, for M. M. turned out to a wo
man. By now the scholatic morale 
of Tech was at its lowest for the 
day and not even a steam roller 
could have stopped us.
With the girls in our midst it 
was decided to give them a treat so 
the parade scoured Science once 
and the last of the students joined 
the crowd. The janitor locked the 
door and hung up a sign "Return 
at 7:30 P. M. Then we started off 
1800 strong, strong in spirit, strong 
in voice and determined to show 
Pittsburgh what it meant to be a 
Tech student. Across the bridge, 
past the library and over to Fifth 
Avenue the joyous army moved. 
Down Fifth, Oakland was soon 
| reached. Here the march was halt
ed while Safety scaled a skyscraper 
and from a lofty position led some 
cheers. But the downtown section 
was bur goal so no time was wasted 
in starting.
For a time it was thot that "rules 
and regulations would force the 
girls to leave us but the powers that 
be were soon induced to give their 
| consent and were they glad? But 
say, were we glad? I felt like hug; gi-ng the whole crowd of them but 
was reminded of the fact that I had 
I a dish pan to beat so decided to wait 
until later. Back on Fifth avenue we 
moved and by this time the side 
shows had started. Preceeding the 
army were the scouts laden with 
chalk and every available place was 
I marked Tech 6, W. & J. o, I ven! ture to say that there is not a street 
car in town that is not beai'ing this 
insignia, no not even a cops coat 
was sparedif he hung around Ion: 
enough. Its a long and tiresome walk 
I down town but the spirit of Tech 
that followed us nothing could stop 
the crowd,
As the scouts reached Diamond St, 
the parade followed. First came sev I eral autos laden with students and 
I a "fair one or two proudly perched 
"IT the radiator. Four girls distaining the use of any vehicle preceeded 
| ilie band, which was followed by a 
I disli pen ensemble. Then came the 
| girls.
"Why co-eds at Tech? is a ques 
I tion that had often boen asked but 
[ those pondering over that question 
[ never saw any REAL, CO-EDS so let 
I them rave on. They have the Tech 
I spirit now and are out to show it 
[ ancl their presence added a touch of 
I colour and distinction to the scene. 
I youve hoard of Pincetons Tiger and
of Yales Bull Dog but Tech has 
something truly alive and they are 
the "co-eds!
Following them came the male 
students four abreast the line ex
tended back for six blocks. All the 
down town section dropped work for 
Tech was out to celebrate a victory 
and having waited for several years 
for the opportunity they were out to 
do things up in style. Pittsburgh 
just stopped everything to gaze on 
a real spirited crowd as the parade 
.loved down Sixth Ave. to Liberty 
At the junction bafety again sought 
the lofty heights and more cheers 
ensued. The line of march was again 
resumed and at the Fourth Ave. sta
tion the parade disbanded. Possession 
was taken of a car and care taken 
that the girls would reach home in 
safety.
But that was by no means the end. 
.t two it was annunced that a dance 
.-ouId be held in the Union at three. 
In each Dormitory "Mellon Hall line 
formed on the right and Forbes Hall 
line formed on the left and again 
the co-eds responded greatfully. This 
time playing the part of "The Big 
Sister. At three the dance started 
and it to was a real TECH affair. A 
Tech orchestra plus Tech students, 
high in spirit, is a mighty enjoyable 
affair and the best dance of the year 
was the experience of all those pres
ent.
The festivities pf the day were 
ended with a huge bon-fire on the 
athletic field in the evening after 
which all turned to the more serious 
thots of the yearscholastic studies.
Say what you like about the day 
the celebration had to come, it was 
inevitable. But best of all it was 
an orderly one, a colourful one and 
at least one in which Tech spirit 
llow'ed to the limit. We may forget 
our Math and we may forget our 
Chem but there is one thing that 
will live in our minds forever and 
that is TECH 6, W. & J. o.
Prospects are bright. Hamman, 
Lynn, Allen, Godden, Gibson 
are back, McCaw and An
derson from Plebe team.
THE ACE OF 
TECHSJOML DECK
New York Sun placed Weirman 
on honorary roll of ballfield 
players.
There is hardly a person at Tech 
who has not heard of Al Weirman, 
the boy who is doing wonders at 
Tech this year in football. Hes the 
fellow who ran 73 yards in that Le
high game for Techs only touch
down. Besides that he has distingu
ished himself in many ways on the 
gridiron with his spectacular plays.
Weirman hails from Sharon High 
School, where heplayed in the baclclield, as quarterback for four years. 
He has a record equalled by few, as 
he had never missed a down in all 
the four years of playing, and nevei 
got hurt. He was captain of this 
team for two years, and led his team 
in scoring.
Westminster then attracted the 
backfield man, and he went there 
for a year, where he distinguished 
himself as he had in high school, by 
spectacular playing and outscorc-d 
all his team mates. Daniells, the 
sporting editor of the New York 
Sun, gave him a place on his honor
ary roll of backfield players, in the 
Eastern Colleges.
Weirman is an Industries, Machine 
Production man and if he can pro
duce the machines the way he plays 
football hell be a winner. We are 
looking for big things from him on 
the gridiron the rest of this year 
and hope he will be back with us 
next year.
PLEBE FOOTBALL TEDIVI
A schedule comprising 27 games 
with such teams as Yale, Lehigh, 
Georgetown, Penn State, Lafayette, 
Colgate, and others of lesser rank in 
college circles, test the strength of 
any college to its capacity. Hal hi
dings Techs resident coach, has the 
problem this year of turning out a 
floor combination to cope with this 
extensive schedule in a creditable 
manner.
Two long trips have been schedul
ed this year, the team playing four 
successive games on each one. Such 
a strenuous amount of playing 
against good teams will require men 
in good physical condition, and the 
call for early practice was in all 
probability a means of preparing 
the men to do their best.
The schedule shows that 11 games 
will be played at home and 16 
games away. Howevei*. this does not 
mean that all good teams will be 
played away for most of them are 
scheduled to appear on our . floor. 
A balcony is under construction at 
present in the gym and the now 
seating arrangement is planned to 
take care of approximately 1200 peo
ple or more.
From the material on hand at 
present the concensus of opinion 
tends toward a light fast team to 
represent Tech this year, consisting 
mainly of experienced men in col
legiate basketball. About 40 men 
have been practicing every night in 
the gym in two separate squads, one 
at 4 oclock and one at 5:30 o'clock.
With the close of the football 
season Saturday, there will be new 
material on hand. Anderson, last 
years Plebe captain and guard 
stands a good chance for a berth, 
Pittman, a new man .at Tech this 
year and a star in football, will 
probably be out after his hip is in 
shape. "Cy Comfort may also be 
out seeking a position as guard or 
center, as will Godden, who showed 
up wfcll in several games last year.
Last years roster remains practic
ally intact this year with the ex
ception of Carey and Moon. '1 lie 
center position left vacant by Scoops 
is being fought for at present by 
Dosoy, McKenna and Swan. Dosey 
has had more experience an seems 
to have a slight edge at present ai
tilo McKenna is a good shot and 
seems to have a knack of getting 
loose. Swan is a big man and fair 
shot and will give the others trou
ble.
For guards, we still have Lynn 
from last year, who did such com
mendable work at foul shooting. 
"Windy is fast, covers up quickly 
and is an excellent floor man. Then 
there is Allen, also a varsity man 
and with two years experience at 
Dennison. "Lefty" is a strong guard 
and handles the ball beautifully, 
and great things arc expected of 
him. Other guards are Nichols, God-, 
den, Levine, Leete and Trimble, all 
capable men and hard players.
At forward, Capt. Hamman and 
Gibson are the only men from last 
years varsity who are out. They 
have several good men opposed to 
them, who will continue to make 
them fight for their positions. Other 
candidates for the forward position 
are McCaw, Sandomier, Jones, and 
McPhee of Youngstown. To date 
McCaw, has shown an uncanny eye 
in shooting baskets, as was the case 
on last year's Plebe team, and shows 
promise of making a position. San
domier has been alternating at both 
guard and forward and is very cap
able at either position. Jones and 
McPhee, new men at Tech, are also 
doing ood work and giving com 
petition to the others.
Tech will no doubt have a basket
ball team representative of her true 
fighting spirit, as the scrimmages 
so far have indicated. Most of the 
men have players of equal calibre 
opposing them. It is up to the team 
this 3rear to make the most attrac
tive schedule and to make a name 
for themselves in the floor game, 
which from present indications they 
will do.
POEM
Again old winter takes the stage, 
The streets are filled with snow 
and slosh,
And once more greets our startled 
gaze
The galloping galosh.
The skirts are shortened to the knee 
The summer furs are laid to rest 
And flapper raiment soon will be 
The low-neck dress.
But 011 these foibles place a ban?
I hardly dare to scold,
For truth to tell, it is the man 
Who has the cold.
The Varsity Must Have a Good 
Team to Practice with 
Plebes share part of 
the glory.
The Freshman or more commonly 
known as, the Reserves football team 
has finished a season, of varying 
amount of success. During the sea
son of five games played, only two 
were placed 011 the win side of the 
ledger, while the remaining three 
were lost. But, in glancing at those 
teams which managed to win out 
over the reserves, it is noticed that 
they were especially good teams, 
won by a score of 48-0; Indiana Nor
mal won 21-0, while Bellefonte Acad
emy won-out to the tune of 19-0. 
Each of these three teams made 
most enviable records during the 
past season, and the fact that the 
Tech Reserves lost to them is not 
at all surprising. There are very 
few preparatory schools that are able 
to cope with the fast teams always 
put-out by Kiski, while there are 
many colleges that are defeated by 
the same team. The Indiana Normal 
game can be classed the same way. 
This team defeated the Pitt Fresh
man, and played a very close game 
with the State Freshman. The In
diana team is blessed with one of 
the best Quarterbacks in this part 
of the country.
In noticing from whom the Re
serves won from-both teams being 
High School teamsa very good gen
eral statement can be drawn regard
ing the status of the Carnegie Tech 
Reserve team. This team was far 
in advance of the average high 
school teams, and somewhat behind 
the standard of the "Prep" schools 
of this district. To the writer this 
seems to indicate that it would be 
a good policy of the management of 
the Reserve team to place only high 
school teams ou the Reserve sched
ule. There is this in support of the 
ibove. One of the main purposes 
of the Reserve team, is to furnish ad
vertisement among the high schools 
of Carnegie Tech. A team that fails 
to.,win a majority of its games sure
ly is a poor medium of advertise
ment, consequently, it scepis that it 
would be a good policy to get games 
with the teams that are more in the 
class of the Reserves. Such would 
seem to be tin; best policy at the 
present time; at least until a time 
has arrived when it will be. consist 
tant with Carnegie Tech to place in 
operation the one year rule. As 
things are standing now, the Fresh
en or Reserve team is sorely hand
icapped by the fact that whenever 
a .good man is developed, the Var
sity takes him. Likewise, there are 
many men who by fact that they
 Freshman, ought t<> be1 playing 
on the Reserve team, but instead 
are so good that they have always 
played with the varsity.
But the Team, even though it fail
ed to advertise the school, has per
formed its other functions admira
bly. It has acted as good "provingground, and developer of new men. 
In this respect'its-work can hardly 
be magnified too greatly, and at the 
some time, it might be very easy 
to minimumize its work in this re
spect. An idea of just what good 
work the Reserve team does along 
this line might be gained from the 
fact that such varsity men as An
derson, and Brumbaugh received 
their initial training and develop
ment while serving on the Fresh
man teeam of last season. No doubt 
there will be many of this years 
team who will graduate to the var
sity next year.
So, taking as whole, the team was 
a success, even though it did lose 
three-fifths of its games, because it 
succeeded in giving experience to 
the new men.
Among the men who will receive, 
their insignia that special mention 
should be made of are Captain Smith. 
Half Back; Schillinger, guard; Me 
Pliee, Half back; McCollum, full 
back; Rex, tackle; - Berglund, tackle; 
Donley End; and Swann End. liv
ery one of these men performed in 
a most creditable manner. They 
were always in the midst of the 
game ever fighting with the old 
Tech fight and spirit, and game 
to the core.
The others that will receive their 
insignia are Griggs, Williams, DonJones, Berryman, Larew, Petersor 
ahue Mertz, Bissell, Fritz, Gibson 
and Manager Martin.
In both of the above groups are 
some very promising varsity mater
ial for next year.

On tire Plaid Screen
By Fred L.Jinowles.
SPEEDY RUSH SAYS 
Speedy Rush, ranking second to Walter Camp in the football world says, 
Of all the shifts Ive ever seen in my time, the shift used by Wally Steffens 
is the best. The quickness with which it operates and the power of con
centration, the discernment produced in the opposing team, makes it the 
most effective shift I have ever had a chance to see.
THE END OF A BEGINNING
Topping Carnegie Techs fifteen years of football, the present season 
closed with a bang and resounds back to Techs beginning and will echo 
to all future protegees of Andrew Carnegie. The W. & J.. game was the 
end of a beginning. An end which was characteristic of Tech. The ac
complishment of a program as planned is far greater than one which just 
happened. It goes to prove that we can do anything, if we but try? Tech 
is out for greater honors and we'll have them. Coach Steffen remarked 
after the game. "The only regret 1 have is that we didn't beat Pitt 
instead of W. & J. but somebody in the background piped up "we're 
granting 110 favors today." All credit in the world to the coach and the 
team but remember those who "keep the home tires burning," principally 
Frank 11. llaarcn, our graduate manager.
HOW MANY FOOTBALL MEN WILL BE BACK?
Three men from hist years squad placed on the football team this 
year? How many of this year's squad will be back next year? Not one 
of them graduates and all of them eligible to play two more years. If 
Steffens has to develop green material next fall, whose fault is it?
There arc two reasons why football players leave Tech, one of them 
is the faculty, the other is the attraction of other schools. The first 
is supplementary to the second. If a man is interested enough in Tech, 
ne can keep up in his studies. The real problem isInterest the football 
men so that other schools cannot entice them away.
BASKETBALL AND ORGANIZED CHEERING
Now that winter has come and the gridiron warriors have put their 
pigskin away, we turn our attention to basketball, perhaps also to hockey, 
if it can establish itself as an inter-collegiate sport for Carnegie Tech! 
The football team this year was hampored by inexperienced material, but 
the basketball squad has a host of experienced men to be picked from 
and under the care of Coach Hal hidings, indications are for the best 
team of which Tech can boast, But here is the point -after the football 
is over all organized cheering is abandoned, even the bands fail to make 
a showingwhy quit when football is over? Football is the biggest sport, 
but it isnt the whole show-The Basketball teams needs your support! 
so back them as you have backed the football team.
ICAN POSSIBILITY-STEFFENS
In George Lloyd Comfort, Coach 
Steffen found a very suitable man to 
fill the big, gaping'hole in his line 
made by tinineligibility of "Vet" 
Williams. Comfort is a real star, 
fact is, the biggest star on the Tech 
Team at present time. It is due to 
his wonderful work in the line that 
enables such men as Brumbaugh. 
Anderson, Wierman and others of 
the backfield to plow through Tac
kle for big gains. And further, it 
is to his credit that practically no 
gains are made by the oposing back
field through the Tech line. Too 
much praise cannot be given to 
Comfornt for his all-round good and 
"bang-up game, always in the midst 
of the light, and ever putting his 
whole strength, heart, and soul into 
the game for the sake of Carnegie 
Tech.
TECHS NEWEST HERO 
LEFT-END, HAROLD McCLEAN
AL. IRWIN, CAPTAIN-ELECT 
ALSO BASEBALL PLAYER
Al, Irwin, Tech center, was cho
sen Captain of the 1921 football 
eleven Saturday night it the Varsity 
Clan banquet, and thereby given the 
highest honor it is possible for his 
team mates to bestow upon him. 
Irwin is the lightest man on the 
squad but weights 3.-*. ounces to the 
pound, and is always leading the 
team in its (lighting spirit. During 
Capt. Goddens enforced absence' 
from the line-up this year, lie has 
been acting captain and has dis
tinguished himself by his qualities 
of leadership and cool headed ness. 
In addition to knowing football from 
the ground up, "Al" has that rare 
instinct of following the ball and 
being at the critical place when 
things are happening there. There 
is no harder or surer tackier on the 
team and he has stopped Techs op
ponents from making . many long 
runs this year.
To Tech's list of gridiron heroes, 
Harold McClean, added his name Sat 
urday in large letters. Picking up | 
the ball when the Presidents punt.
was blocked, and dashing sixteen 
yards thru the mud and muck for 
the only scroe of the game is enough 
to make any man famous. Add to 
this the fact that it was the first 
time Tech had ever scored on W. & 
J. and the first defeat they had ever 
handed a first class team, places 
"Mac" on the very pinnacle. His run 
and the result will go down in his
tory and be something. never to be 
forgotten.
McClean came to Tech from Pea
body High School where he played 
tackle for three year. He started to 
p'ay that position here last year, but 
on account of his weight, was chang
ed to end. He soon showed great im
provement in his playing of the cor
ner position and has been kept there 
ever since, It is a difficult thing to 
change to a different position after 
learning to play one, blit "Mac" put 
his heart into it and strived to learn 
with a determination which ha. 
made him one of the best ends in 
these parts.

As is well known, an "inning" in

They enjoyed the speeches, liked 
their proximity to the stellar foot

the tribute paid their presence by 
Mr. Nichols. His sincere remarks 
will not soon be forgotten, nor the

CLAN AND ALUMNI MEMBERS 
TO PAY DOES AT ONCE
VARSITY CLAN BANQUET OVERFLOWS WITH TECHSPIRITTEAM FEEDS 
(Continued from page 1.) 
gret and that is that we werent 
playing Pitt today.
While the dinner was still being 
served about one-lnindred girls from 
the dormitories came marching into 
the beanery in a snake formation 
where they received a rousing wel
come. They sang Dear Old Tech 
and gave several cheers for the team, 
then circled around the players ta
ble in a regular snake dance. Their 
presence at the banquet was a sur
prise and their spirit in coming over 
was most commendable.
President Ilamerschlag made 
short address, in which he euologized Coach Steffen and Capt. Godden ns well as the whole team. He 
made a plea to keep the men up in 
their studies and have them back 
for next year. To the cries of A 
holiday Monday which had been 
set up by the undergraduatesand 
band present, he declared he would 
shed 110 crocidile tears if the fac
ulty saw fit to suspend classes for 
the day, blit he could not give his 
permission at that time.
The results of the election for the
1921 football captain were then read 
by Mr. Overend, who said that A1 
Irwin, center, had been unanimously 
elected to that position by his team
mates. Yells and cheers greeted this 
annuoncement and "Al" was boosted 
up on a chair to make a speech. He 
thanked the squad for the honor 
they had conferred upon him and 
said he could have made a better 
talk if given a little more prepara
tion. Captain Goddcn spoke and 
gave a fine tribute to the substitutes
011 this years team, who he declared 
and taken the hard knocks all year 
without the glory. He said nothing 
could have made him happier than 
to be Captain of the team which had 
defeated W. & J. and he hoped Irwin 
would be captain of the team which 
would defeat Pitt.
Graduate Manager Haaren thanked 
the men who had helped to male 
this year such a notable one in the 
football annals of Tech, and told 
every one to keep an eye on th 
basketball team. He announced that 
the following men had received let
ters: Wittmer, Comfort, Henderson, 
Irwin, Rosenbloom, Sprinkle, MeClean, Ilaible, Griffin, Wierman 
Godden, Marshall, Pittman, Robert
son, Anderson and Brumbaugh. The 
following received the minor C 
for cross-country: Cavette, Code, Mil
ler and McDonald. Unsinger receiv
ed a major C as manager of the 
football team and McGill a minor 
for managing cross-country. He then 
announced the results of the elec
tion for officers to the Varsity Clan. 
Pres., Casey; xst Vice Pres., Colmery; 
2nd Vice Pres., Alferdie; 3rd Vice 
Pres., Elleran; Athletic Council for 
two years, Overend; for one year, 
Hengstrom; Secy-Treas., Hirsch. The 
Athletic Council elected Blesch to 
be manager of football for next year.
"Bert Munhall was called upon 
to make a long speech, but gave a 
very short one instead in which he 
congratulated the team and coach 
upon their splendid showing Satur
day. Unsinger then made a few re
marks, a nd Dean Tarbell closed the 
speaking with a plea to keep to
gether and work to-gether all year 
in the same spirit which had per 
vaded everyone at the banquet.
Music was furnished by the C. 1. 
T. Band and the Design orchestra 
a,nd their efforts to make the eve
ning a success were greatly appre 
ciated. The student waiters came in 
for their share of the praise and 
were thanked for their effecient ser
vices.
Members expected to do mission
ary work among promising 
prep school men.
A clan roster has been forwarded 
to all clan secretaries showing w'hich 
of the clan members are in good 
standing in the Alumni Federation. 
Since the constitution of the Fed
eration requires that all Tech men 
wishing to become clan members be 
in good standing in their Alumni 
Association, a little personal cam
paign in your own clan will soon 
make it a 100% paid up organiza
tion. Forward a check for dues to
G. L. Tilbrook, Treasurer Alumni 
Federation. Receipts for the dues 
will be returned at once.
All Tech clans or separate alumni 
an do Tech an immense amount of 
good by missionary work among 
promising high school students, 
not only to secure athletic material 
but to secure good scholastic mater
ial of the type which we like to des
ignate as good Tech men.
I trust that every alumus and ev
ery clan organization will co-operate in every way possible to make 
this a banner year in alumni work. 
Keep us informed of address chang
es. Do some real missionary work in 
securing former students and grad
uates as members of the Alumni As
sociation and by securing real high 
school material for Tech next year. 
Yours for Tech,
G. L. TILBROOK, 
Alumni Executive Secy.

SCIENCE MEN, ATTENTION!
Second statements were issued last 
week for alumni dues. Why make 
this necessary . There are a few 
men who forward their dues im
mediately upon presentation of a 
bill, while others require two and 
tree statements before finally re
mitting. This issue'of two and three 
statements is very expensive, both 
in material and time. Please help 
cut the cost of collection by paying 
your dues promptly for the year 
ending June 30, 1921. Make two
and three statements unecessary in 
the future. Thank you.
TECH6 W. & J.0
(Continued from page 1.) 
in their possession, Marshall had his 
collar bone broken, when he tackled 
Lawrence who was returning a punt. 
1-Ie left the game immediately and 
was replaced by Anderson. With ten 
minutes of the second quarter gone, 
Pittman slipped in the slime and 
threw his hip out of joint, and he 
had to be carried from the field. Be
fore this accident he had been play
ing an excellent game and doing the 
punting for Tech.
Nothing pleased the Tech men 
more than to see Captain Godden 
get into the game during the last 
quarter. He had been out since the 
Grove City game with a bone brok
en in his ankle, and his entry into 
the lineup came as a big surprise. 
Red felt so good about being able; 
to play that at the first opportunity 
he made a spectacular dive for Dun
bar, upsetting him completely for 
what was the hardest tackle of the 
game.
The whole team ran wild for what 
was the greatest day in their lives, 
despite the mud and water-soaked 
condition of the field. There were 
eleven stars, and each one shown 
brilliantly. If space permitted a
paragraph .could be written about 
each one. Anderson distinguished
himfself by his brainy interference, 
and punting, sending the ball low 
and fast along the field, and was hard 
to handle. Wittmer was down un
der every punt and fell on the ball 
to keep W. & J. backs from return
ing it, in addition to holding down 
his extremity of the line in master
ly style. As was told before Comfort 
blocked Ericksons kick, and Sprink
le on the other side of the line play
ed his position well. Rosenbloom 
broke through the line several times 
, once downing Erickson before he 
could get started for a loss of eleven 
yards. Henderson again displayed the 
grit and stamina which has made 
him a tower of strength in the line 
all season, and was in the thick of 
every play. Last but not least is the 
Captain-elect of next years team, Al 
Irwin at center. He was all over the 
field at the same time, following the 
ball with rare instinct, and playing 
his usual scrappy game. Although 
the ball was wet and slippery all 
through the play, he never once 
made a poor pass to the backfield.
The game was a great boost for 
Coach Steffen, who already has the 
reputation around Western Pennsyl
vania of being one of the best coach
es in the country. Men who had not 
seen the Tech eleven in action be
fore this season were loud in their 
praise of the smooth machine he 
had built from the material avail
able. He was the center of a con
gratulatory group in the gymn after 
the game and wore a smile which 
would not wear off.
