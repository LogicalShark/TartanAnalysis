Fraternity Delta Upsilon moves off the Quad; sorority Delta Gamma moves in
The Panhellenic Council is the governby Amanda Cole ing body of the Panhellenic Association
Staffwriter (PHA), which is composed of representa
tives from all five sororities on campus.
The PHA exists to develop and maintain 
relations between sororities on campus, 
as well as the larger campus Greek com
munity, according to Carnegie Mellons 
Greek life website.
The Panhellenic Council, under former 
president Amy Shields, held a forum to 
determine the best candidate. Ultimately, 
they decided that Delta Gamma was the 
most logical choice since the sorority is in 
need of more space for their members.
It just made the most sense since 
[Delta Gamma was] already planning 
on expanding, said Kerra Doyle, current 
Panhellenic Council president.
Delta Gamma sisters had planned to 
knock down a wall in their current house 
in order to expand to fit more members.
Moving into Delta Upsilons house will 
save them this work, since the house is 
bigger and has more beds.
The Panhellenic Council presented the 
recommendation to Michael, who agreed 
with their choice in his final decision.
This is not the first time that 
Delta Upsilon has had to leave ? 
the quad. The chapter lost its lease 
for the 2005-2006 school year due to 
an underage drinking violation. The 
university allowed the fraternity to move 
back into the house last summer  a re
turn that proved to be short-lived.
It is also not the first time that a so
rority has been asked to move into 
a vacated fraternity house: Kappa '-"irM 
Alpha Theta moved into Delta Tau 
Deltas house on the fraternitjjp 
quad in the fall of 2005.
While the details surrounding if 
Delta Upsilons move off the quad ms 
emerge, Hippensteel and Bebie 
confirmed that the fraternity 
be leaving for financial reason^fM 
and Delta Gamma will take theife  
place.
The fact that Delta Upsi|||
Ion isnt coming back is not 
secret, said Hippensteel.
Representatives from 
Delta Upsilon and Delta 
Gamma could not be reached 
for comment. -fffijSB1 ji
This summer will bring a major change 
to the fraternity quadrangle. Fraternity 
Delta Upsilon (DU) will not be renew
ing its lease for the upcoming school 
year, vacating its house on the fraternity 
quad. Sorority Delta Gamma (DG) will 
take up residence in the house once DUs 
lease expires, according to Student Life 
representatives Monica Bebie and Holly 
Hippensteel.
Delta Gamma will be moving into 
5031 Forbes Avenue this summer and 
will be signing a new lease, Hippeni steel said.
feoi The decision was made by Tim 
Michael, director of Campus 
Services, who effectively 
By^^feves as the landlord of 
^^^^;i^feek housing. However, he approached the 
Panhellenic Council for 
a recommendation as to 
who should live in the 
house next year.

U.S. News ranking error bumps university from top 10Linguistics

all, were mistakenly placed on the 
top-10 list so that they appeared 
to compete with programs at MIT, 
Stanford University, and the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley, 
which hold the top three spots, 
respectively.
The mistake prompted officials 
at UT-Austin to call U.S. News, 
demanding an explanation as to 
their exclusion from this years 
rankings. Instead, the university 
ended up calling the publications 
attention to what they realized 
was an error.
The misprint also caused PSU 
to submit a press release an
nouncing the success, which the 
university later had to retract.
Consequently, the U.S. News 
guidebook was recalled, the 
rankings on the magazines on
line edition have been corrected. 
In addition, next weeks print is
sue will include the corrections.
While I hate to see our pro
gram not among the top-10 list, 
I have full confidence in our pro
gram and see it as much more 
than one annual misprint in its 
ranking, said Joey Cordes, a firstyear graduate student in electri
cal and computer engineering.
However, there was no mistake 
in U.S. News rankings of gradu
ate-level engineering programs 
overall, which placed Carnegie 
Mellon at number six.
U.S. News rankings are deter
mined on a scale of one to five,
with five being the best score. 
The cut-off for this years top-10 
list was UT-Austins score of 4.1.
The lowest score published by 
U.S. News is 2.5. Both PSU and 
UT-Arlington had ratings below 
this cut-off, which made them 
ineligible for placement on the 
list. Nationwide, 73 programs re
ceived scores of 2.5 or above.
U.S. News stated in an April
5 press release that the mistake 
was a data glitch due to reli
ance on computer printouts.
However, this is not the first 
time that U.S. News has made an 
error. The rankings fiasco comes 
on the heels of an incident with 
Sarah Lawrence College that 
occurred just last month. The 
publication was unsure how to 
place Sarah Lawrence in its rank
ings because the college no longer 
collects SAT scores, one of the 
seven categories on which each 
school is judged. U.S. News de
cided to rank the school based on 
the assumption that its average 
SAT was one standard deviation, 
or 200 points, below the average 
of its peer institutions.
Sarah Lawrences ranking, 
based on this information, was 
to be published in the U.S. News 
annual guidebook, as well as in

Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members have combined 
efforts to create an interde
partmental linguistics major, 
which they believe will further 
strengthen language study at 
the university.
The new linguistics major 
will provide students with a 
comprehensive understand
ing of the use of language and 
the importance of language in 
society.
Faculty involved with the im
plementation of the linguistics 
major say that the rich presence 
of language study at Carnegie 
Mellon will make this a strong 
program.
Weve been running the lin
guistics minor for many years, 
said Mandy Simons, a philoso
phy professor and director of 
the new major. And we have 
wonderful resources here for 
providing a linguistics major. 
The new major will consist 
of courses in the departments 
of English, modern languages, 
philosophy, and psychology in 
H&SS as well as the Language 
Technologies Institute in the 
School of Computer Science. 
By offering a variety of courses 
that all concern the study of 
language, the major will give 
students the opportunity to 
study language from several 
different perspectives.
The study of language has to 
be a cross-disciplinary study, 
said Simons. With research, 
your view has to narrow, but 
on the undergraduate level 
you want to have the op
portunity to explore it from 
different directions. It lets 
you get a multifaceted view of 
language.
Students pushed for the lin
guistics major to add to the 
resources already available at 
Carnegie Mellon.
A number of students who 
had completed the minor in lin
guistics had expressed the wish 
that it was possible to continue 
their study to lead to a major,, 
stated G. Richard Tucker, the 
head of the department of mod
ern languages.

major will not be halted by the

The TVC is hosted by the Un
dergraduate Entrepreneurship 
Association (UEA). The goal of 
the UEA is to foster the entre
preneurial spirit, said Anand 
Durvasula, a junior in economics 
and social and decision sciences 
and chair of the TVC.
The money that the students 
receive for winning projects is 
meant to be used for marketing, 
business planning, and product 
development.
The TVC benefits more than 
just the students themselves; its 
also good for the Pittsburgh area 
as a whole. Most of the funding is 
provided by SMC Business Coun
cils, a trade association for small 
businesses in Pennsylvania.
SMC has an interest in devel
oping the newest businesses in 
the area, and $10,000 is a small 
price to pay for that, Durvasula 
said.
The UEA accepts student pro
posals for the TVC from all over
Pennsylvania, but most of them IB1;  
come from students m the Pitts
burgh area. This year there were - ,r
six competing teams from four  i
universities: Carnegie Mellon,
the University of Pittsburgh, AlJmjJM
legheny College, and Grove City f|||||p T ' jfl
college.
The applicant pool has been 
slowly growing in the eight years , , s? W
since the TVCs inception, Durvasula said.
Although many of the com. .:;;v
panies represented were tech f ,
companies like MyMave and 
AbbyMe, other competitors 
included Cephas Stone Care, 
a business that would provide 
cleaning and sealing for houseV
hold marble and granite, and

H&SS announces new 
major in linguistics
Kurt Vonnegut, novelist and former CIT student, dies
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
Kurt Vonneguts official web
site currently features a framed 
picture of an open birdcage, 
drawn in his trademark squig
gly black ink, with his name 
and life span beneath. The site 
has no links to a short biogra
phy, bibliography, tour dates, 
or contact information. Like his 
novels, Vonneguts website was 
both simple and profound in de

Wednesday, writer Kurt Von
negut died in Manhattan. He 
was 84.
The author of novels such as 
Slaughterhouse-Five, Cats Cra
dle, and Sirens of Titan died as a 
result of brain injuries sustained 
during a fall several weeks ago, 
according to an April 12 article 
in The New York Times.
Vonnegut is known for his 
lighthearted approach to ques
tions that have plagued human 
existence, chronicled in the 14 
novels that bear his name. A 
World War II veteran, he wit
nessed the Dresden firebombing 
that burned thousands of civil
ians alive, which is a central topic 
in one of his most well-known 
novels, Slaughterhouse-Five.
Vonnegut briefly attended the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
to study mechanical engineering 
in 1943.
He was his own man  
one-of-a-kind writer, said Hil
ary Masters, a Carnegie Mellon 
professor of English and creative 
writing. Masters recalled en
countering Vonnegut at a PEN 
writers association party in New 
York: He was doing his Mark 
Twain imitation  baggy white 
suit, bushy hair, and flowing 
mustache.
Vonnegut appeals equally 
to the current generation of 
students and contemplative 
thinkers.
The first time I took seriously 
a meaning for life was when I 
read Sirens of Titan, said sophomdre fine arts major Brenda 
Battad.
Screenwriter James V. Hart 
told MTV.com on April 13 that he 
and Vohnegut recently adapted 
Sirens of Titan for film.
Vonnegut was born to Kurt 
Vonnegut Sr., an architect, and 
Edith Vonnegut in Indianapolis 
in 1922. Vonneguts brother Ber
nard, a physicist, died in 1997. In 
his early 20s, Vonnegut attended 
Cornell University, Carnegie In
stitute of Technology, and the 
University of Tennessee to study 
the sciences before shipping
off to Europe with the army in 
1944, according to The New York 
Times.
After the war, he married Jane 
Marie Cox and settled down in 
Chicago. As he worked to pro
mote his writing, Vonnegut took 
many jobs. En route to getting 
turned down for a masters de
gree in anthropology by the 
University of Chicago, Vonnegut 
worked as city police reporter.
In 1947, his family moved to 
the Northeast, first Schenect
ady, N.Y., and then to Cape Cod, 
Mass. He worked in public rela
tions for General Electric, wrote 
for Colliers magazine, taught 
emotionally disturbed children, 
and started a Saab auto dealer
ship while trying to catch his 
first break in the publishing 
world.
His early novels were very 
conventional. and nothing spe
cial, Masters said.
In the 1960s and 70s, Von
negut reeled off a series of novels 
that would establish his reputa
tion among college students and 
opponents of the Vietnam War, 
beginning with his acclaimed 
Cats Cradle.
Even decades after the war 
that inspired his career, students 
seem to look to Vonnegut for 
moral guidance. .
His writing was a simple 
thing about bigger, more inter
esting topics, said Jeremy Neuberg, a sophomore studying soSee VONNEGUT, page A4
U.S. News error shifts ECE program ranking
RANK, from A1
rankings.
Sarah Lawrence officials al
leged that U.S. News had no right 
to make such an assumption and 
report it as fact in the magazines 
rankings.
There is a bigger issue here 
regarding how much importance 
we should put on these U.S. News 
rankings, Schlesinger said. We 
need to keep this in perspective 
since one single number cannot 
quantify a college or university 
program.
Fellow colleges and university 
administrators agree. At least 10
liberal arts college presidents 
are preparing letters to be sent 
to their colleagues at hundreds 
of other colleges and universi
ties nationwide proposing a new 
set of policies to challenge the 
role of the rankings, according 
to the online news source Inside 
Higher Ed.The proposal includes 
ceasing to cooperate with U.S. 
News and refusing to fill out its 
reputational survey, which 
represents 25 percent of the 
magazines ranking formula.
The ranking formula judges 
each school on seven broad fac
tors: peer assessment, reten
tion and graduation of students,
faculty resources, student 
selectivity, financial resources, 
alumni giving, and graduation 
rate performance.
U.S. News places more value on 
output factors, such as gradua
tion rate and reputation, than in
put factors, such as entering test 
scores. Only about 50 percent of 
nationally accredited universi
ties and their programs make it 
to the coveted list, according to 
Inside Higher Ed.
However, according to the 
magazines website, rankings 
are only one of many criteria 
students should consider in 
choosing a college.
Students and faculty agree 
that there are countless other 
factors at play. They feel that 
no matter what its ranking 
turns out to be, their program is 
strong.
I think school rank is a small 
factor in peoples decisions to 
apply to or attend a particular 
graduate program, said James 
Downey, a graduate student in 
the universitys electrical and 
computer engineering program. 
There are much more important 
factors, such as graduate spe
cialty and advisor choice. Rank 
mainly contributes to bragging 
rights.

major will give students more 
freedom in their study of lan
guage, Tucker noted.
We have faculty who do really 
exciting work in linguistics or in 
hyphenated areas of linguis
tics [such as] psycholinguistics, 
sociolinguistics, computational 
linguistics, Tucker said. The 
breadth of the interests and the 
depth of the expertise is quite 
amazing, and we are well po
sitioned to offer a very exciting 
program.
The majors core curriculum 
is divided into the studies of the 
sound, structure, and meaning 
of language. Students are also 
required to complete at least two 
semesters of foreign language 
instruction. After receiving a 
foundation in language study, 
students can narrow their fo
cus with specialized electives 
in different concentrations. The 
program culminates in a thesis 
study at the end of senior year.
The senior year capstone re
quirement is a unique aspect of 
the major that allows students to 
focus on a specific interest that 
may have developed over the 
course of their undergraduate 
career.
Partly because of interdisci
plinary nature of the field, there 
is a need for a final scholarly 
experience to sum up the study. 
Students can look back through 
the project, said English profes
sor Paul Hopper.
The far-reaching scope of 
the major is intended to spark 
interest across colleges. Those 
involved with the creation of 
the major feel that students of 
different majors will choose to 
combine linguistics with an
other concentration to gain an 
in-depth understanding of how 
language relates to their area of 
study.
Simons praised the major for 
its flexibility and feels that it 
will be fairly easy for students 
to broaden experience with the 
assistance of what they learn in
the major.
The program will also prepare 
students to enter a wide range 
of fields 'after graduation. Even 
several of the faculty members 
behind the establishment of the 
major are linguists who have 
branched out into other fields.
Careers go from humanitar
ian to business to academic to 
government, said Lori Levin, a 
professor at the Language Tech
nologies Institute who was also 
instrumental in the creation and 
approval of the linguistics major. 
Careers that accommodate lin
guistics majors can range from 
national security intelligence 
analysts for the government 
to assisting international busi
nesses, she said.
If you know language tech
nology and linguistics and you 
work for a company with a lot 
of international business, you 
can help this company tremen
dously, Levin said. Students can 
also turn to teaching and trans
lating as possible career options, 
but Levin assures students that 
there are not only academic 
careers available for linguistics 
students.
Perhaps one of the most ex
citing parts of the new major is 
the enthusiasm of faculty mem
bers to make Carnegie Mellon as 
well-known for linguistics as the 
university is in other areas.
We have faculty who are in
terested in applied linguistics 
and, in particular, in the area of 
language acquisition, individual 
differences in second-language 
learning, the development of 
bilingualism, the development 
of pragmatic competence, the 
development of reading and 
writing skills, etc., so we are 
well-positioned and extremely 
interested in contributing to 
the success of the new major, 
Tucker said.
Carnegie Mellon is the type 
of place where linguistics will 
thrive, Hopper said. Were ex
cited about it and look forward 
to working with students inter
ested in the program.
Students interested in the ma
jor should contact Simons for 
more information.

Novelist Kurt Vonnegut dead at 84
VONNEGUT, from A3
cial and decision sciences.
In addition to his appearance, 
the potent American satire in 
Vonneguts writing helped draw 
comparisons to Mark Twain. But 
the alternate universes and par
allel dimensions found in some 
of Vonneguts novels owed just 
as much to his training in the 
sciences as to creative word play 
and political engagement.
Vonnegut once reportedly re
ferred to George W. Bushs as
cendance to the presidency and 
control of the federal govern
ment as a Mickey Mouse coup 
dtat.
I think we are terrible ani
mals and I think our planets 
immune system is trying to get 
rid of us, as it should, Vonnegut 
said once as a guest on The Daily 
Show with Jon Stewart.
Carnegie Mellbn English pro
fessor Alan Kennedy recalled 
a Vonnegut guest lecture he 
heard while at the University of 
Edinburgh, around the time the 
film Slaughterhouse-Five was 
released.
It seemed clear that Von
negut didnt like the movie,
Kennedy said. He claimed 
that he had tried to get the di
rector to insert a little smiling 
picture of Vonnegut in the upper 
right corner of every frame, so 
the audience would remember 
that there was an actual per
son behind this production. The 
movie is terrible and would be 
much better if it had included a 
personal touch.
Kennedys assessed Vonneguts 
writing more positively.
He became probably the most 
inventive, imaginative, and fresh 
storyteller of the second half of 
the 20th century, he said.

questions.
The competitions faculty ad
visor is Arthur Boni, director of 
the Don Jones Center for Entre
preneurship at Carnegie Mellon. 
Boni emphasized the learning 
aspect of the challenge.
This should be an educational 
process, he told the assembled 
competitors during the awards 
ceremony. Entrepreneurship is 
all about perseverance. Take our 
feedback and learn from whom
ever you can.
One of the events judges was 
Tom Jones, a representative for 
venture capital firm BlueTree 
Capital Group, LLC.
If you dont win, dont take it 
personally, Jones told competi
tors. Revise your proposals and 
come back again.
The competitors seemed just 
as excited for the professional 
feedback as for the prize money.
Advice from the judges was 
really great, Kroleski said. That 
kind of feedback is the best you 
can get.
Kroleski took second prize as 
co-founder of Bare Apparel, a 
business that would print cus
tomizable and college-specific 
T-shirts.
Winners of the Tepper Venture 
Challenge have proven that hard 
work pays off. Tressler, a junior 
in business administration and 
co-founder of MyMave, said that 
their team works 20 to 30 hours
a week in addition to classes.
My friends dont know what I 
look like anymore, said Salame, 
who took home the first-place 
$10,000 check.
Salame just returned from 
winning second place in the Uni
versity of San Francisco Business 
Plan competition. She recently 
qualified for the Moot Corp 
Competition at the University of 
Texas at Austin.
Aside from being a lot of work, 
for these students, their busi
nesses are their lives.
Every check just goes back 
into the business and our invest
ment in us, Kroleski said.
Its so much fun  people 
dont understand, Salame said. 
Entrepreneurship is the life. Im 
actually living the dream.

Pitt Alum receives Grainger Award for water filter system
by Michael M. Whiston
Science & Technology Editor
In an attempt to help people 
effectively respond to a nuclear 
threat, engineering and public 
policy professors Keith Florig 
and Baruch Fischhoff have pub
lished an article in Health Physics 
called Individuals Decisions Af
fecting Radiation Exposure After 
a Nuclear Explosion.
The articles intent is to provide 
individuals with information not 
offered by the government about 
nuclear blasts.
Florig, the lead author of 
the paper, said that there is a 
problem with how the United 
States government organizes 
information on nuclear blasts. 
In particular, he said that gov
ernment officials do not ask the 
public about what they are inter
ested in knowing.
That [information] goes out 
pretty much as unfiltered ad
vice, he said.
Florig and Fischhoff hope 
to help people make decisions 
about how to prepare for and 
respond to a nuclear blast with 
their paper.
Florig said, That kind of in
formation thats very simple to 
produce is just not available.
In their paper, Florig and Fis
chhoff considered whether it was 
worth purchasing the emergency 
supplies recommended by the De
partment of Homeland Security. 
The Department of Homeland 
Security recommends purchas
ing such supplies as food, tools, 
bedding, and clothes, in case of

Pitt alum Abul Hussam was 
recently awarded the Grainger 
Challenge Prize Gold Award by 
the National Academy of Engi
neering (NAE) and The Grainger 
Foundation for his invention of 
the SONO filter, which removes 
arsenic from drinking water.
NAE President Wm. A. Wulf 
stated in a National AcademThe authors found that the 
supplies cost $465 for initial 
stocking and $250 per year to 
maintain. Moreover, the authors 
found that there is only a slight 
probability that these supplies 
will actually be used  less than 
1 percent.
This probability is based on 
several other contingencies, how
ever, including whether the 
wind will be blowing in the indi
viduals direction, whether that 
individual is home, and whether 
that individual finds out about 
the threat in time to react.
Environmental Health Admin
istrator for Allegheny County 
Anthony Gaglierd said that there 
are many different types of nu
clear incidents, each of which 
has different ramifications and 
appropriate responses. The least 
severe incident, he said, is the 
exposure of individuals to a ra
dioactive source.
Thats basically going to af
fect the people that are there, 
said Gaglierd.
Dispersible radioactive iso
topes, on the other hand, are 
radioactive sources that contam
inate an entire area.
If the device explodes, [the] 
explosion is probably going to 
be the biggest problem, said Ga
glierd, injuring or killing people 
in the area.
In the case of a dirty bomb, 
or radiological dispersal device, 
which consists of both explosives 
and radioactive materials, Ga
glierd said that public officials 
must assess radiation and con
tamination levels. They would

of the $1 million prize is to ac
celerate the development and 
dissemination of technologies 
that enhance social and envi
ronmental sustainability for the 
benefit of current and future 
generations.
This year, the theme of the 
challenge was to design, de
velop, and test a water purifier 
system that is both workable and 
capable of lasting for a long time. 
The filter is meant to be used in
developing countries, such as 
Bangladesh and India.
According to the NAE, the 
drinking water in Bangladesh 
and other countries contains up 
to 50 times the amount of arsenic 
that is safe to drink. Such high 
levels of arsenic heighten an in
dividuals risk of developing skin 
cancer and or brain tumors.
Arsenic is undetectable by 
taste or smell. Water that appears 
crystal-clear can contain arsenic. 
People who consume unhealthy
amounts of arsenic can develop 
lung disease decades later. This 
prospect led Hussam to act.
Hussam began developing this 
filter in 1987 when he found that 
the drinking water in his home
town of Kushtai, Bangladesh was 
contaminated with arsenic. With 
the help of his brother, he set up 
a testing site and began the de
velopment of a filter that evolved 
into the SONO filter.
Hussam stated that his re
search and teaching in analytical
chemistry and chemical equilib
ria, as well as his knowledge of 
the basic chemistry of arsenic, 
have helped him create a system 
that measures and controls arse
nic levels.
These [experiences] helped 
me to design a better filter. 
Measurement is the key in this 
development, and I have the 
key, Hussam stated.

The dyes can be placed in 
window panes to be used as a

How Things Work: Roller Coasters
Jun Xian Leong
Roller coasters are truly a lesson in 
physics, as most roller coasters involve 
momentum, inertia, and gravitational 
acceleration, with outside propulsion 
provided only at the very beginning of 
the ride.
The concept of a roller coaster began 
with Russian ice-slides, which were tall 
platforms built during winter with a long 
ramp coming down on one side. People 
would then cover the ramp with a layer 
of snow, and sliders could climb up the 
ladders on one side and slide down the 
snow-covered side on large sleds.
By the year 1817, Les Montagues, the 
first roller coaster with cars that locked 
onto rails, was built in France, and roller 
coasters have been a source of wild ex
citement worldwide ever since.
Even today, roller coaster cars are, 
essentially, little more than sleds with 
wheels. The basic car does not contain 
any electronics or motors, and some
times, does not even have brakes. The car 
is towed up the initial incline by means of 
an external conveyor, or sets of motored 
gears. From thereon out, though, its pure 
physics at work.
Potential energy is stored as the cars 
are towed up the first incline, reaching a 
maximum as the car arrives at the top. As 
the car goes over the peak, gravity accel
erates the car down the incline.
This acceleration is a conversion of po
tential energy to kinetic energy, meaning 
that the car accelerates. The car gains 
speed and momentum as it rolls down 
the hill, and this built-up momentum is 
all that propels the car around the bends, 
loops, and twists that make riding a roller 
coaster an exciting experience.
By the laws of conservation of energy 
and momentum, however, the total en
ergy of the car cannot exceed the initial 
given energy. Hence, the first hill must 
always be the highest, and each subse
quent hill cannot exceed the height of the 
one before it if the car is to successfully 
*go over the peak. 
Corey Werner/Art Staff
Humans experience a thrill from riding roller coasters from the fight or flight response.
Furthermore, friction and other dissi
pative forces cause the car to constantly 
lose energy to its surroundings in the 
form of heat and sound, and this means 
that each hill must be strictly lower than 
preceding ones.
The concept is similar to that of a ball 
rolling down a hill. As long as the incline 
of the hill is downward, the ball will con
tinue to roll down, even if it encounters 
bumps that launch it upward at times.
The first public roller coasters were 
constructed out of wood, and even today, 
many of these wooden roller coasters re
main in use worldwide.
Wood is a much weaker substance than 
steel, however, and wooden roller coast
ers cannot hope to match steel coasters
in terms of height, incline steepness, and 
track length. Most wooden roller coast
ers do not have loops.
Steel roller coasters were not widely 
built until the mid-1900s. However, the 
beginning of steel roller coasters marked 
an entirely new age in roller coaster con
struction. Steel is much stronger and 
more malleable than wood, and it allowed 
for the creation of loops, corkscrews, and 
other features that are commonly seen in 
modern roller coasters.
Among some of the most important 
things that designers must pay attention 
to when designing a roller coaster are the 
acceleration, the rate of change of accel
eration  jerk, and the rate of change 
of jerk  snap. ^
The acceleration is extremely im
portant in determining if a ride will be 
exciting and sufficiently scary without 
being uncomfortable. Jerk and snap 
measure the forces present upon vari
ous parts of the coaster at each point in 
its movement, and are pivotal in roller 
coaster safety.
Maintaining reasonable levels of 
jerk and snap ensure that neither the 
users nor the building framework are 
subjected to abruptly large forces, which 
could cause bodily harm or structural 
collapse.
Todays most modern roller coasters 
incorporate many new features, includ-. 
ing accelerator pads midway to prolong 
the ride and reversible tracks through 
which cars travel both ways during a 
single trip.
Furthermore, improved methods of 
propulsion such as magnetic accelera
tors or compressed air launcher systems 
are currently being used to launch roller 
coaster cars up to speeds of 100 miles 
per hour in a few seconds, and the high
est roller coasters in the world can tower 
up to over 400 feet high. The Kingda Ka 
at Six Flags in New Jersey, for instance, 
drops 418 feet and is accelerated to a 
maximum speed of 128 MPH in just over
3 seconds.
Neurologically, because a roller coaster 
is thrilling, it triggers the fight or flight 
response within the human nervous 
system by presenting it with situations 
perceived to be dangerous. This sense of 
danger induces the release of adrenaline 
and dopamine in the brain, which acts as 
a reward for having survived. Hence, 
the more dangerous a roller coaster 
seems to be, the greater the rush one gets 
from riding it.
Because they are built to simulate 
dangerous situations, roller coasters are 
built under the strictest regulations pos
sible for the safety of the users. Six Flags 
conducted a study in which researchers 
found that there is a less than one in oneand-a-half billion chance that a rider will 
be killed from injury. |

chemistry and M.S. in physi
cal inorganic chemistry at the 
University of Dhaka, in Dhaka, 
Bangladesh, in 1976. In 1982, he 
completed his Ph.D. in analyti
cal chemistry at the University 
of Pittsburgh.
Currently, Hussam works 
as a professor of chemistry 
and biochemistry at George Ma
son University in Fairfax, Va.
Hussam has published over 90 
scholarly articles. His research 
aims to understand the chemis
try behind arsenic in water and 
how a filter can be built to re
move this arsenic.
As explained by the Mason 
Gazette, the SONO filter is a 
three-bucket (or kashi) system 
that filters out arsenic from 
drinking water. The water enters 
through the top bucket, which is 
filled with river sand that filters 
the water.
Next, the water enters the sec
ond bucket. In addition to river 
sand, this bucket contains wood 
charcoal, which filters organic 
substances, and brick chips, 
which remove fine particles 
in the water. After the second 
bucket, the water enters the 
third bucket, where it is ready to 
be used.
According to a Washington 
Post article, the filter contains 
20 pounds of iron, which bond 
with the arsenic. This bonding 
ensures that the arsenic does 
not enter the filtered water in 
the presence of oxygen.
According to Hussam, the 
SONO filter is currently being 
installed at a rate of approxi
mately 200 filters per week in 
Kushtia, Bangledesh.
Hussam stated, It is satisfy
ing to see people use our filter 
and feel a sense of well-being. 
When I drink this water at my 
home in Kushtia, Bangladesh, I 
know exactly the water quality.
The cost of each filter is be
tween $35 and $40. Each filter 
can provide water to 400,000 
people.
The filter can produce 20 li
ters of water in an hour. Newer 
models can produce more than 
50 liters per hour. With the use 
of the prize money, Hussam 
plans to scale down the filtration

system to make a tabletop unit 
and also scale it up to create a 
system that can be used nation
wide in the United States.
According to Hussams web
site, there are over 10,000 of his 
purifying water systems present 
in Bangladesh.
When asked about the bridge 
between science and society, 
Hussam stated, In this country 
the news media is overselling 
the potential of some of the ex
otic technologies.... This has
diverted resources from devel
oping sustainable technologies 
by using known solutions. The 
issue of water and health in most 
underdeveloped and developing 
countries can be solved through 
simple but local initiatives. 
Hussam is also developing a

also need to quarantine the af
fected area.
While dirty bombs do not 
create self-sustaining nuclear re
actions, Gaglierd said that they 
might contaminate individuals 
with plutonium or uranium, or 
damage surrounding buildings.
If radioactive contamination 
travels through the air as a re
sult, it may reach homes outside 
of the immediate blast area. Ga
glierd said that people near the 
affected area will probably not 
have time to evacuate and should 
seek shelter in their basements.
According to Florig and Fischhoffs paper, a person 20 to 50 
kilometers away from the blast 
would experience a 2 percent
cancer risk if sheltered, com
pared to a 20 percent cancer risk 
if unsheltered.
Florig said, The gamma radi
ation from these particles is very 
penetrating. According to Flo
rig, the typical basement blocks 
90-95 percent of gamma rays.
In light of the basements 
sheltering capability, Gaglierd 
suggests keeping a bin of canned 
food and water ready for emer
gency purposes. Gaglierd 
suggested preparing for a nu
clear threat just as one would for 
a flood or snow storm.
Youre acquiring stuff every
day, Gaglierd said. When you 
go shopping, buy an extra box of 
cereal, a couple of extra cans of 
ravioli.
In regard to whether it is
worth the money to purchase 
emergency supplies, Florig said, 
Each person needs to do that 
calculation for themselves.
Additionally, the paper pro
vides information about how 
long a person should remain in 
a shelter after a nuclear blast. 
According to the paper, such a 
decision depends on both the 
basements level of protection 
and how long it takes an individ
ual to cross the contaminated 
area.
Such information, Florig 
hopes, will allow individuals 
to make informed decisions 
when faced with the threat of a 
nuclear attack.
All of these questions ought 
to be worked through, Florig 
said.

Election platforms: How do 
your candidates stack up?FromTheEditorialBoard
ited scope of Weinstock-Jains platform. 
Some of their Facebook statements seem 
to be aimed specifically at WeinstockJains second initiative, which would 
create a cultural organization commit
tee that will get independent cultural 
organizations to work together on larg
er, more successful projects.
The downside, as articulated by 
Sternell-Hudock on Facebook: cultural 
clubs, and other organizations under
stand their needs better than any of the 
candidates up for election this year. Our 
role is to empower and enable these 
leaders... acting as a catalyst for success 
and not a roadblock.
It is not clear how they think other 
tickets are acting as roadblocks, though 
I tend to agree with Sternhell-Hudock 
on this issue. Weinstock-Jains proposal, 
which is echoed with less clarity by 
Eaton-Fasehun, looks like a shinier and 
more invasive version of the Committee 
on Student Organizations (CoSO) direct
ed specifically at cultural organizations.
Admittedly, the initiative could work 
in the same vein as TartanWiki and the 
CoSO to promote the passing of knowl
edge between expert parties and make 
stronger organizations. But the commit
tee could consist of preachy organization 
leaders who drop in every few weeks to 
bother you about your parties and hassle 
you about your lack of collaborative 
spirit. The idea of a group of people with 
conflicting opinions coordinating events 
among dozens of semi-willing cultural 
organizations screams of bureaucratic 
pain and hardship.
The only reason I can criticize 
Weinstock-Jain, however, is because they 
have the most articulate and concise 
platform. Its hard for me to scrutinize 
Sternhell-Hudock, because they plan on 
continuously developing and modify
ing their platform. Ostensibly, that is 
perfect, but it also means they have pre
sented us with no issues to debate, no 
plan to critique, and no way to measure 
their progress throughout the year.
Though all of the candidates have 
outstanding credentials, one of the most 
impressive candidates on the market is 
also the most recent. Coming in late in 
the game, Serge Egelman and Joe Arasin 
stake their hopes on their political expe
rience. Serge was the only Carnegie 
Mellon student to testify at the Port 
Authority hearings and meet with politi
cians. He has a strong experience in lob
bying on issues that are pertinent to our 
students: not nebulous issues like pride 
and collaboration, but issues like federal 
financial aid and student tax burdens.
Unfortunately, Egelman and Arasin 
are both graduate students, which makes 
one wonder what, their commitment 
is regarding undergraduate concerns. 
Their platform is also nowhere near as 
streamlined and accessible as WeinstockJains, or even Eaton-Fasehuns. I see a 
few hints of substance  a committee 
for Pittsburgh involvement, driving peo
ple to the polls, etc.  but they present 
no clear plan, which is a serious detri
ment when facing candidates who do.
A few things to take away from this 
election are that clear platforms, whether 
they have five, 10, or 100 planks, are the 
only way that we are going to be able to 
have any sort of discussion on the issues. 
Considering that only half of the candi
dates have websites, few have a made a 
strong appearance on campus, and the 
debates are the day before we vote, this 
election has occurred almost exclusively 
over Facebook. This means that sup
port will be measured not by general 
agreement on the issues, but by how 
many Facebook friends you can coerce
 which makes this election more like 
an election for Homecoming King and 
Queen than student body leaders.
Andrew Peters
Since the student body presidential 
debate wont occur until the day before 
before the election, Id like to offer a 
discussion of this years issues. If the stu
dent body president and vice president 
candidates Facebook groups are any 
indication, then we might improve on 
last years rather blas elections.
Without a doubt, the ticket that has 
broadcast its message with the most 
strength is Sean Weinstock and Adi Jain. 
Their neon posters, clean website, and 
persistent use of Facebook messages all 
suggest strong and concerted leader
ship. The duo contends that their goal is 
to create actual change, and not focus 
on issues that are out of the student 
body presidents hands or already 
being worked on by the staff of CMU. 
Yet a quick look at their five platform 
issues suggests that some of the ideas 
are not as radical as their neon fliers 
would have you believe.
The first issue of their CMU 5 deals 
with the improving the library. I whole
heartedly agree with Weinstock-Jain. 
My views were articulated in an edito
rial in the November 6 issue of The 
Tartan, which was met with a kind reply 
by Gloriana St. Clair, dean of University 
Libraries, who has been working on the 
problem for a while through focus groups 
and student advisory committees. So at 
least one-fifth of the platform is actually 
already being worked on by the staff of 
CMU, which, given the smaller scope of 
this tickets goals, is unfortunate.
The thing that is really revolution
ary about the Weinstock-Jain ticket is 
that they were the first to come out and 
admit the limited role of the student 
body presidency and set, for the most 
part, attainable goals. Of the five ideas, 
the most helpful in the long run and the 
most likely to succeed in creating actual 
change is the tickets proposal to improve 
TartanWiki. Institutional memory is the 
bane of the college organization, and 
the TartanWiki effort is a great way 
to share knowledge. The ticket should 
be commended for its inclusion of this 
overlooked resource.
Turning to candidates Alan Eaton and 
Abiola Fasehun, I must say it appears 
this duo have bitten off more than they 
can chew. Their policy outline covers 
most of the issues raised in WeinstockJains CMU 5 and much more.
One of their worthwhile ideas is the 
enforcement of the moratorium on 
classes from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m, which 
was designed to give students a chance 
to break and also to give student orga
nizations a clear window to schedule 
meetings. However, some colleges 
sought exemptions from the moratorium 
and have classes during that window.
Other parts of the platform are down
right noxious. Perhaps the most topical 
change they have proposed is the instal
lation of Homecoming King and Queen, 
which, distressingly, is probably the 
easiest change to institute. Were not in 
high school and we dont go to Pitt. At 
Carnegie Mellon, I fear, this proposal 
will cause more giggling than pride. A 
real change these two could enact would 
be to put pressure on the university to 
hold the Homecoming game at Carnegie 
Mellon instead of Cleveland.
Coming in after the elections dead
line was extended, Colin Sternhell and 
Lauren Hudocks position seems to be 
a response to both of the other tickets, 
which, if the case, is an encouraging 
show of non-apathy.
While it is clear that this ticket is 
antagonistic to issues on both of the two 
previous tickets, their statement in last 
weeks issue of The Tartan indicated that

Students uninformed about upcoming elections
may have a chance to hear about the 
elections. Making the elections success
ful isnt the sole responsibility of the 
candidates, though. The Student Senate 
needs to work hard this week to get stu
dents into the voting mindset.
More importantly, student govern
ment needs to find a way to make sure 
future elections dont suffer from the 
same problems next year. First, the elec
tions are mandated to take place during 
March or April; a policy prohibiting 
elections from immediately following 
Carnival would go a long way. More 
importantly, student government and 
the Elections Committee must commu
nicate with the student body in a timely 
fashion. They should advertise the elec
tions early and make sure potential 
candidates can find the information and 
resources they need by keeping the elec
tions website up-to-date.
The number of candidates running in

to those of the past few years. There are 
four tickets running for the student body 
president/student body vice president 
office, four candidates for the student 
body vice president of finance office, 
and 35 candidates running for office in 
Student Senate. Last year, only about 20 
candidates were on the ballot.
Still, the date-change undermines 
the elections. If last years elections  
which were also postponed until after 
Carnival  is any indication, turnout 
levels are likely to be dismal. Last year, 
a mere 1287 students (about 16 percent 
of the eligible student body) cast votes 
for student body president. In 2004 and 
2005, more than 2100 voters cast bal
lots. Its too late to do anything about 
the date change, but the candidates and 
the Student Senate Communications 
Committee need to work hard to avoid 
another embarrassing year.
The range of candidates could be the 
saving grace for election turnout. With 
more variety in the candidates than in 
recent years  mostly thanks to the 
graduate student ticket of Serge Egel
man. and Joe Arasin  more students
Every year, the student government 
elections turn out to lack candidate and 
platform variety, student body inter
est, and student involvement. This year 
has the potential to be different, but the 
candidates and the elements of student 
government responsible for publicizing 
the elections have their work cut out for 
them.
In the notorious tradition of recent stu
dent government elections, this years 
election run-up got off to a bad start. 
While the date for the elections was orig
inally set to be April 9, those responsible 
for facilitating the process neglected to 
publicize the event to attract and inform 
candidates. Furthermore, the Elections 
Committee faltered by failing to make 
information and the required candidate 
petition forms available. As a result, 
only a handful of student senate candi
dates were set to run.
The Elections Committee pushed 
back the date and managed to make the 
important information and resources 
available; the candidate pool quickly 
filled. This years election is somewhat 
remarkable in that respect, compared
Imuss career ended by media-sawy public
On April 12, NBC News canceled out
spoken media personality Don Imuss 
show after a 28-year run in the morning 
rush-hour slot. CBS Radio, Imuss main 
employer, issued Imus a two-week sus
pension from the air.
The suspension was a result of a 
racially offensive remark Imus made 
on April 4 about the African-American 
women on Rutgers basketball team, 
whom Imus referred to as nappy
headed hos. The networks decisions 
were a response to the backlash from 
people of all races that emerged on the 
womens behalf, led by figures like the 
Reverend A1 Sharpton, Illinois Senator 
Barack Obama, and New Jersey Senator 
and Rutgers alumna Nia H. Gill.
Executives of both networks apolo
gized for the incident, but thats not the 
point. The Rutgers incident is only the 
most recent of a continuum of offensive 
remarks that have brought a certain 
brand of fame to Imus since the begin
ning of his career. Imuss career should 
have been nipped in the bud after he 
referred to African-American sports 
columnist Bill Rhoden as a New York 
Times quota hire and PBS anchor Gwen 
Ifill as a cleaning lady more than 20 
years ago.
But Imus is an equal-opportunity dis
criminator. He has been caught on the 
air calling Arabs ragheads, the em
ployees of publishing company Simon 
and Schuster thieving Jews, and re
peatedly using derogatory terms to refer 
to women, gays, Catholics, and others.
Imuss recent stint generated a spell 
of radio rubber-necking by the Ameri
can public at large. Like drivers who 
cant turn away from a gruesome car 
wreck on the side of the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike, listeners couldnt help tun
ing in to catch the fallout from the inci
dent. The morning following the show 
in question, 624,000 people did so, a 
50 percent increase from the size of the 
shows typical audience. Imuss abhor
rent behavior pushed the ratings of Imus 
in the Morning on MSNBC to their high
est level in months.
The question still remains  after 
decades of offensive behavior, why does 
Imus get the ax this time? Because of 
an increasingly media-savvy, not to 
mention desegregated, public. So many 
people tuned into Imuss show the day 
after the incident not just to gossip 
about it, but for reasons of genuine pub
lic concern for the impact of the media 
on groups that dont have the name or
the fame to talk back quite as publicly. 
These people  of all races, no less  
lent their voices to fight back on behalf 
of the African-American women on Rut
gers basketball team. Had there been 
such a public to stage a backlash of the 
same degree 20 or 30 years ago, Imuss 
career would have been extinguished 
before it began.
Editorial Dissent
Don Imuss career is a quest for can
dor in a society that is politically correct 
to the point of self-deception. He said 
publicly what millions will only think 
or say in the most private of settings. 
He forced people  famous and influ
ential interviewees and listeners alike
 to face the music. Each time someone 
was taken aback listening to his show 
and asked Can he say that?; Imus 
succeeded. Imus wasnt fired for mak
ing derogatory remarks on air. Our so
ciety has no problem with that  open 
discrimination against homosexuals, 
women, blacks, Arabs, and dozens of 
other groups is condoned in the media 
continuously. But now that Imus has 
been fired, we can all get back to hiding 
our darker side.

Perspectives
Uniting forces to 
combat student 
complacency
-----
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Carnival is our greatest tradi
tion at Carnegie Mellon. Yes, we 
really do get days off for this. 
This is our homecoming, our big 
celebration. And believe me, you 
dont want to miss it.
During Carnival, you will 
most likely see some of our can
didates for student government 
campaigning. You should think 
about voting for the candidates 
who seem like theyll do the best 
job, and who care enough to try 
to get your vote.
Both Senate and Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA) have 
really done a fantastic job this 
past semester (the best weve 
ever seen, by a long shot)! This 
is largely because of the people 
who have elected to join student 
government this past year, as 
well as new leadership. We can
not state strongly enough the 
impact Joel Bergstein and Beth 
Ayers have made as Senate Chair 
and GSA President, respectively. 
And, even better, they are sup
ported by the strongest Executive 
Committee chairs weve seen. 
Senate and GSA committees are 
the new face of student govern
ment.
But, no matter how praisewor
thy, these efforts are simply not 
enough. Officials become com
placent when getting elected 
is definitely a sure thing. If you 
dont know the candidates, ask 
why, and make it your responsi
bility to find out. Vote for leaders 
who will not only get things done 
but who will also make student 
government a more visible part 
of campus.
Were proud to have served 
as your executives for the past 
year. We dramatically increased 
student governments visibility 
and we got a lot done along the 
way. But what we could do wont 
be good enough. The next execs 
must continue to raise the bar for 
student leaders. Execs should not 
limit their goals  they should 
be continual problem solvers 
looking to meet any goals their 
students want them to achieve.
The next execs should not be 
as involved, as issue-driven, or as 
active as us. They should be more 
so. Vote for the candidates who 
are competent, who will make 
an impact, and who will bring 
even greater visibility to student 
government.
At Carnegie Mellon, we work 
hard and we play hard. The last 
thing we should do is forget it 
all and slide backward into com
placency. So, after Carnival is 
over, when you sit down to check 
your e-mail and hit the books, 
make sure you take the time to 
VOTE. Take time to consider 
candidates platforms and most 
important issues. Then vote 
wisely next Tuesday, April 24 
through Wednesday, April 25 at 
elections.andrew.cmu.edu.
This Thursday begins what is often touted as Carnegie Mellons most famous tradition  Spring Carnival. So we asked,

Major dilemma: Pick a major you love and dont let it define you
Marissa Miracolo
First-year Ph.D. 
Mechanical engineering
Booths, theyre for kids.
Sarah Mogin
Whats your major?
Youve heard this question 
before. You heard it at Playfair, 
amid a giddy sea of meetings and 
greetings. You heard it on the 
first day of class, when a profes
sor asks introductions of every 
student around the room. You 
even heard it at parties, shout
ed over beer pong or indiscreet 
dancing. Its the Whats your 
sign? of the 21st century. Its 
your first impression. Its... you.
Maybe.
You might have blocked this 
part out, but youve been think
ing about your major since at 
least your senior year of high 
school. Nearly all college applica
tions request an intended major
 and besides, it can help you 
get in. You might be a girl inter
ested in computer science. Maybe 
you want to major in chemistry 
and English at MIT. Or, perhaps 
you intend to pull a triple major: 
vocal performance, information 
systems, and... math?
Whatever the circumstances, 
to prospective colleges, a major is 
like a promise: This is what Ill do. 
This is who I will become. Its not 
set in stone, but its a start.
And suddenly, its orientation 
week, and Whats your major? 
is the first thing everyone asks.
Whats my major? For most of 
my first year, I was doubling in 
physics and English, and I would 
answer the former, the latter, or 
both  depending on my audi
ence. In Matter and Interactions, 
I was a physics major. In British 
Lit, I was English. To my friends,
I was both. At parties, I was, 
What? Lets keep dancing!
Every major has a certain con
notation (some more vivid than 
others) that is impossible to 
escape. Whether youre such a 
typical CS major or so not what 
youd expect from a CS major, 
youre still a CS major. Even if 
you break the stereotype, youre 
still tied to it.
So declare it already. Most of 
Carnegie Mellons colleges have
declare dates set during the first 
year (mid-spring), though some 
allow you to wait until youre a 
sophomore. Either way, it seems 
a little premature.
By mid-spring of your first 
year, youve taken, what, four or 
five classes? And half of four or 
five others? Oh, and CSW. You 
havent had time to take cours
es in general relativity, organic 
chemistry, literary theory, group 
theory, decision analysis  the 
topics that might make you ques
tion your love for a given sub
ject. Moreover, you havent taken 
Principles of Economics, Intro 
to Psych (or Anthropology, or 
Programming), Survey of Forms: 
Anything, Concepts of Math  
the classes that might introduce 
you to a major you never knew 
you wanted to pursue.
Ive heard this story too many 
times: A student discovers the 
major he or she should have 
declared  too late.
Too late. By the time you figure 
out the subject you want to be 
your major, youve already taken 
a handful of courses for your 
old one. Maybe your new major 
is in a different college. Maybe 
you chose this school specifical
ly because of your old majors 
department. Maybe your parents 
wont approve.
But screw your parents, screw 
paperwork, and screw phony 
departmental prestige  this 
is your life. Okay, I know: Life 
is long, and life is complicated. 
Theres grad school, finding 
jobs, losing jobs, marriage, kids, 
quarter-life crises, mid-life crises. 
Considering all that, whether 
you choose history or econom
ics doesnt seem like that big of 
an issue.
Still, your decisions matter. If 
you settle now  during your 
crazy college years  youre set
ting a lousy precedent. Are you 
going to pass up Mr. (or Ms.) 
Right because you found some
one not-so-right first? Are you 
going to turn down a new job 
because youre afraid of leaving 
your old one? You might not be 
your major, but you are what 
you do.

ground knowledge: where they 
live, where theyre from, what 
theyre doing over the summer.
Your real friends, on the other 
hand, should mean more than 
such petty facts. Frequently, I find 
myself forgetting what states my 
friends live in, what theyre study
ing. When youre dealing with 
true-blue, shoulder-to-cry-on, 
hold-your-hair-back, laugh-tilyou-snort friends, their majors 
can seem, well, minor.
Naturally, it works both ways. 
If you change your major, your 
friends may not even notice, let 
alone care.
Going back to this too late 
debacle  I think we say too 
late too soon. With four years 
and the possibility of summer 
courses, you should find the time 
for a couple of false starts. It 
can be painful to relinquish those 
units you spent months attaining
 to admit that you took a class 
for no reason at all  but its 
necessary.
Ijnean, I ate Lucky Charms for 
breakfast this morning. I chose 
jeans over khakis. I took Diff Eq 
last semester. None of these deci
sions is going to help me to earn 
my degree dujour (double major 
in creative and professional writ
ing), but I dont regret them.
If you try to reduce everything 
to units  things you can col
lect and redeem like the tops of 
cereal boxes  youll go crazy. I 
know, its easy to think like that. 
Carnegie Mellon makes you want 
to think like that. But not every
thing is redeemable  all of it, 
however, is valuable. ,
So, heres where you come in:
if impotent debate turnout was 
explained away in the past with 
the excuse that student govern
ment doesnt do anything, then 
students should be eating their 
words now. We have clearly seen 
that student government has an 
impact on campus life. For the 
first time in Carnegie Mellons 
history, guys and girls can room
campus this year, and with every 
year to come.
Though the president and vicepresident failed in adequately 
planning the campus bike pro
gram, at least the two executives 
actually accomplished some
thing.
Weve seen what type of impact 
a go-getting president and vice
build a piece of public art us
ing marshmallows and gummy 
bears. While comical to see what 
the candidates created, it didnt 
serve any specific purpose. This 
debate will not be a waste of the 
audiences time or effort. I plan 
to allot a portion of time for an 
open forum, so that the audi
ence can let the candidates know
Why should next years president and vicepresident try to accomplish anything, if the 
student body appears to not care at all?
together under the new co-ed 
housing option. Furthermore, 
the fleet of communal bikes made 
a forceful entrance on campus as 
all the bikes were used within 
a day of their arrival amongst 
speculation that all of the bikes 
would be stolen after a week.
While it is probable that most 
of those bikes will never turn up 
on campus again, we can be sure 
that another student govern
ment election will take place on
president can have on this cam
pus. But why should next years 
president and vice-president try 
to accomplish anything, if the 
student body appears to not care 
at all? Students need to attend 
the debate, and they need to 
make their voices heard.
As moderator of the upcom
ing debate, I have the unique 
opportunity to decide the for
mat of the debate. Last years 
moderator had the candidates
what is most important to their 
respective campaigns.
The debate is especially im
portant this year, because it will 
also include the candidates for 
student body vice-president of 
finance (VPF).
For those who dont know what 
the VPF does, its simple: He or 
she manages the money that stu
dent government controls. The 
VPFs duties range from advising 
the student body president on
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
Do what you want. If you dont 
know what you want, try every
thing. And, stop asking, Whats 
your major? I can think of plen
ty of better questions: What are 
your hobbies? Whos your favor
ite author? Whats the Skibo 
frozen yogurt flavor of the day?
If all this sounded preachy
 the exorbitant use of the 
second person, the look-at-meTm-a-sophomore wisdom, etc.
 keep in mind: Im speaking 
partly to myself. I can rattle off a 
list of four or five majors Id love 
to attain (most of which I find 
myself loathing at least some of 
the time), and Im okay with 
that. Ill make and re-make the 
decision about my major(s) a 
couple more times between now 
and graduation. And, whatever
I decide, itll be exactly what I 
want.
SarahMogin (smogin@) is having 
trouble applying for internships 
because she doesnt know what 
major(s) to put on her resume.

It was a warm day in April
2006 when three sets of stu
dent body presidential and vicepresidential candidates debated 
in the student government elec
tions. But what wasnt warm was 
the turnout of people interested 
in the debates  a total of 37 
people were in attendance, in
cluding the 6 candidates.
The lack of student turnout 
needs no verbal explanation, 
the figures explain it all: On a 
campus of approximately 10,000 
students, only .37 percent of stu
dents cared enough to attend 
the debates. This years debate 
needs an adequate amount of au
dience turnout. The candidates 
will debate at 5 p.m. on April 
23 in McConomy Auditorium. 
Debating in an empty audito
rium would be a travesty, and a 
complete debacle for Carnegie 
Mellons student government.
I often hear students com
plain that student government 
doesnt actually do anything, but

Golf team finishes fifth at regionals
GOLF, from A12
Coming off a win at the 
Westminster Invitational and 
now a fifth-place finish at the 
Mid-Atlantic Regional, the Tar
tans are positioning themselves 
well for the remainder of the 
season. They were scheduled to 
compete at the Edward Jones 
Shootout at the Links-Spring
Church in Apollo, Pa., this past 
weekend, but it was postponed 
due to weather.
Our goal is to still make the 
national tournament, Smith 
said. Were not really sure how 
the selections going to work since 
theyve changed' the process this 
year. I think we still have a shot, 
and realistically we need to win 
out. We think if we win out the
next three or possibly four tour
naments we have an argument. 
The Carnegie Mellon golf 
team will next compete in the 
Saint Vincent Invitational at the 
Latrobe Country Club in Latrobe, 
Pa., on Thursday. The UAA cham
pionships will follow, on April 22 
and 23, at Orange County Na

Tartan track and field competes at three meets
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
On Tuesday, the Carnegie Mel
lon track and field team hosted 
Seton Hill College, Waynesburg

Mens and womens tennis teams win two apiece
by Erin Gagnon 
Sports Editor
After the Tartans dual 
matchup against Grove City Col
lege was postponed on Tuesday, 
the mens tennis team traveled 
to Albion College in Albion, 
Mich., on Friday to compete at 
the Great Lakes Mens Tennis 
Championships. In addition to 
the Tartans, the tournament 
included teams from Albion, 
Calvin College, Denison Univer
sity, DePauw University, Hope 
College, Kalamazoo College, Ke
nyon College, Oberlin College, 
Wabash College, and the College 
of Wooster.
On Friday, Carnegie Mellon 
defeated the Calvin Knights 5-3.
In the number-one singles match, 
first-year James Muliawan beat 
Knights player Ricky Tilton 7-5, 
0-6, 6-4. Fellow first-year Jon 
Spero also won his singles match 
by a score of 6-1, 6-4. Sopho
more Yiran Liu defeated Knights 
player Steve DeMaagd 7-5, 
3-6, 6-4, and junior Andrew 
Clearfield beat his opponent
6-1, 6-0. In doubles competi
tion, Clearfield and Liu defeated 
Dan Volkema and David Sneller 
8-3 to secure the Tartan victory.
On Saturday, the men won a 
close semifinal match against 
Albion 5-4, before falling to the 
eighth-ranked DePauw team 0-5 
in the championships. The Tar
tans dual match record moves 
to 17-4.
[Albion] was really a great
win, senior Jordan Koslosky 
said. We got down early in the 
doubles 2-1, and once again we 
had to fight back. However, dur
ing that time there wasnt any 
sense of panic with any of the 
players. I feel that even though 
we have a young team, all of the 
close matches this season have 
made us extremely match-tough, 
and even though we were down, 
we had confidence in ourselves 
and the rest of the team that we 
would end the day with a vic
tory.... [Depauw is] a very tough 
team, and I think most of us were 
mentally and physically burned 
out after our tough match versus 
Albion. All in all, it was a suc
cessful weekend for the team. 
We were seeded third and ended 
up placing second.
Next the mens team will host 
Washington and Lee University 
on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
On the womens side, bad 
weather on Sunday moved the 
Tartans home matches to the 
indoor courts at Club 4 Life in 
Monroeville, Pa. The women 
faced Saint Vincent College and 
West Liberty State College. The 
Tartans defeated both teams, 
sweeping Saint Vincent 9-0 and 
taking West Liberty 7-2. The 
wins move Carnegie Mellons 
season record to 10-7 in dual 
matches.
The womens team will travel 
to Cleveland this weekend 
to compete at the University 
Athletic Association cham
pionships, hosted by Case 
Western Reserve University.

Junior Staffwriter
As the assistant director of ath
letics for university programs, 
Mike Mastroianni is an impor
tant part of Carnegie Mellons 
sports. He schedules facilities 
for fitness, aquatic, physical 
education, intramural, and club 
events. Also, Mastroianni re
cently received the Boys Coach 
of the Year award for coaching 
and turning around the Bethel 
Park High Schools basketball 
program. This week, The Tartan 
sat down with Mastroianni to 
talk about his role within Tartan 
athletics.
Tartan: What brought you to 
Carnegie Mellon?
Mastroianni: I have a busi
ness degree and a masters in 
sports management, and I did a 
graduate internship where I ran 
intramurals at Slippery Rock 
/University. I always wanted to
get into athletic administration 
at some level, and there was an 
opening here so I took it. I have 
been here for 21 years.
T: What is unique about intra
mural and club sports?
M: We try to create an atmo
sphere where the intramurals 
and clubs are varsity games. 
Not everyone can play at the 
varsity level, so we try to keep 
that atmosphere for those stu
dents.
T: What does your job entail?
M: We schedule all of the 
facilities, the games, and con
tests. We run everything on a 
daily basis. We have 40 different 
activities going on during the 
academic year, and there will 
be a lot of crossover with events 
going on at the same time. It is 
continuous, so it really never 
ends during the academic year.
T: What have you personally 
done to improve our athletic 
programs?
M: When I cam here, there 
wasnt an official club and there 
was individual scheduling. We 
made it more serious, making 
the games more important. We 
enhanced the whole intramural 
atmosphere by having officials, 
by making it a big ordeal. We 
created a womens IM All-Sports 
trophy that is awarded to the 
team that wins the most points 
throughout the course of-the 
year. That is great because it 
hel}> increase participation and
keeps people interested, keep
ing them active.
T: Do you try to balance the 
amount of mens and womens 
teams?
M: In intramurals, we offer 
everything for men and women. 
If We dont, women can partici
pate on the mens side. We wont 
limit them because there arent 
enough numbers. Women can 
play in an all-womens league, 
but then play minors with a 
combination of some guys  
women would play against an 
all-male team just to enhance 
participation.
T: What is your favorite 
part about being in charge of 
CarnegieMellons athletic pro
grams?
M: There are always new ac
tivities going on. IMs are really 
popular. They are avenues that 
help release the demands of the 
day academically. There are only 
400 campus varsity athletes in 
the 17 sports we offer, but then 
we have another 6000 who get 
their release through IMs.
T: Are there any sports that 
you would still like to add?
M: We have a student board, 
so if it is recommended to us 
and there is student interest, 
then we will add it. We have 
added and taken some sports 
away over the years based on 
participation. We added pickle 
ball and euchre, and things of 
those scftts.
T: Do you think that some 
clubs could eventually become 
varsity sports?
M: We are restricted by our 
facilities because we are land
locked in the city. I think we ask 
our stadium and our intramural 
fields to do more than they can 
handle.
For us to add more outdoor 
sports  for instance, mens 
lacrosse  we couldnt do it. 
Because of Title IX we would 
have to add two sports, and two 
sports becomes very demanding 
of our facilities, [and] right now 
our demand is already at its 
highest level.
Club sports roller-coaster 
depending on participation of 
the students and how active the 
student leaders are. Our club 
sports are strong now, but when 
club sports ask me to become 
varsity, they lose what is special 
about club sports: flexibility. 
Practicing three times a week 
with a club sport at the type of 
school we are at, and being able 
to play a game on the week
end, may be a perfect match, 
whereas the demands of a var
sity athlete may be too much for 
most. Sometimes what you wish 
for is not always what it seems.
T: Have you considered in
corporating your coaching skills 
into Carnegie Mellon athletics?
M: Coaching has a lot to do 
with who you are dealing with 
and managing personalities. I 
use my coaching skills on a daily 
basis just doing my jc/b.
Golf team rebounds on 
second day to take fifth
by Doug Fricker
Senior Staffwriter
Last Monday, the Carnegie 
Mellon golf team competed in 
the final day of the two-day MidAtlantic Regional and finished 
fifth out of the 15 teams there. 
The event, held at the Hershey 
Country Club in Hershey, Pa., 
saw the Tartans make up for 
their less-than-stellar perfor
mance on Sunday by rebounding 
on Monday to turn in the secondbest team score, shooting a 309 
during Mondays round.
Franklin & Marshall College 
won the team title with a twoday total of 624, thanks to a low 
score of 304 on the second day. 
Last years champion, Allegheny 
College, finished second with a 
score of 628; the Tartans score 
of 641 placed them fifth.
Sophomore Alex Timmons, 
last weeks University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Golfer of the 
Week, led the Tartans with a 
two-day total of 160, including
a 78 on Monday. Junior How
ard Smith turned in Carnegie 
Mellons lowest round of the 
tournament on Monday with a 
75. Smith and first-year Chris
topher Lee both shot two-day 
totals of 161. Sophomore Joshua 
Chen contributed to the team 
score with a 78 on Monday, to 
leave him at 162 overall, and 
first-year Brett Cannaday carded 
a two-day total of 176 (83, 93).
This was one of our biggest 
tournaments of the year and 
all the top teams of our region 
were out there, Smith said. 
The course was pretty tough; 
the weather played havoc on 
everybody. Scores were really 
high the first day and we didnt 
shoot well. The second day we 
came back strong, with the 
second-lowest round. We really 
played well, but it was too little 
too late to be in contention for it. 
Overall we did a good job bounc
ing back the second day after a 
tough first day.

SDC: If you can fix your transi
tions, you might find the trophy 
at the end of the rainbow.
Fringe: Races are in the morn
ing. Whats the point of making 
your new wheels glow-in-thedark?
SPIRIT: Youre a shadow of your 
former selves.
Sig Nu: The king of spades 
doesnt beat the ace.
AEPi: Was your new buggy built 
by the 5-year-olds who fingerpainted it?
PiKA: Your A-team buggy
must be really fast, because we 
havent seen it at the finish line 
this year.
CIA: DragForce =-(l/2)pv2ACd 
... aerodynamics?
Pioneers: Your buggy drowned 
fording the river.
Phi Kap: Sweepstakes, this is 
the last year we will be doing 
this. Its not you, its me.
KDR: Mel Brooks said it best: 
Shes switched from suck to 
blow.
Sig Ep: Can a balanced man bal
ance both Booth and Buggy?
Beta: So easy a caveman can do 
it.
This is not the year for set
ting records. Once again we see 
the unavoidable affects of bad 
weather and a deteriorating 
course.
On race day, expect to see 
inexperienced drivers and un
perfected lines.
Pushers as well as drivers will 
have to bear the weather on race 
day. With cold temperatures 
that havent been seen this late 
in years, blame global warming 
and not push teams for slower 
times.
Looking to the womens races: 
With respectable teams coming 
out from KDR, Fringe, and Beta, 
the race still comes down to two 
teams.
With a near win last year, ex
pect the veteran push team of 
SDC A to be fast this year. How
ever, odds are still with PiKAs 
women. Along with very expe
rienced pushers, PiKAs depth of 
technology will ensure a win.
Moving on to the men: Dont 
expect the one-horse race we 
saw last year. This year there 
are three strong teams, which 
will result in one of the most in
teresting races in recent history. 
Fringe appears to be tapping all 
of its technological resources, 
proving they realized that you 
cant teach an old wheel new 
tricks.
Even with a push team to keep 
it interesting, Fringe is going to 
learn what it feels like to lose to 
another independent.
If its good to finish a streak on 
top, PiKA did just that last year.
Last year, despite PiKAs onetwo finish and mens B course 
record, SDC A will be the team 
to watch this year. I bet the fog 
isnt the only reason that PiKAs 
A team buggy from last year 
wasnt finishing the course at 
rolls. My dark horse pick rests 
with SDC. SDC has been lurk
ing in the shadows, but finally 
tfyeir team has caught up to their 
technology. With pushers giving 
SDC the advantage, transitions 
are the only thing that can keep 
them away from the trophy this 
year.
As far as the other races go, 
expect good runs from Sig Nu 
and SPIRIT. Sig Nus pushers 
are keeping them competitive, 
and consistent technology will 
keep them in the top five. With 
potholes that could blow a car 
tire, SPIRIT should tread lightly. 
Assuming no mishaps, look for 
them to round out the top five.
Despite the poor weather and 
craters in the road, dont expect 
the excitement of the race to di
minish in any way. With three 
teams making this a race, expect 
conditions to affect times but not 
the competition.
New spectators will be spoiled 
with a close contest this year, 
something that most people 
havent been lucky enough to 
see in recent history. This year 
we will see strong finishes from 
experienced teams, despite the 
lack of free rolls this semester. 
Look for problems from teams 
that could have used the benefit 
of rolls.
Best of luck to all the teams. 
And al for race day, Ill se| you 
out there, but will you see me?

Visions of Hell
Emio Greco | PC performs at the Byham Theater
Everything you need to know
Presented by the Pittsburgh Dance Council,
Emio Greco | PC (a contemporary dance 
company based in Amsterdam) presented its 
latest performance-based construction, Hell, last 
weekend at the Byham Theater. Internationally 
acclaimed for its innovative pieces, Emio Greco 
| PC, founded by Emio Greco and Pieter C. 
Scholten, offered an unconventional and startling 
new interpretation of contemporary dance.
The piece revolved around a central theme 
exploring hell, and through its abstractions 
of movements and themes, it catered to the 
principle of a free audience. Without any imposed 
story line, the movements and dance numbers 
were independent entities: they were only 
loosely connected to each other, despite smooth 
transitions, and allowed room for viewers to adapt 
the piece to their own interpretations.
The opening to the show had a slower pace 
than the content that followed. With slow 
movements and deliberate, drawn-out beats, the 
dancers displayed sharp, staccato movements 
characteristic of the performance. Permeating 
throughout was a general sense of frustration, 
which could be seen in the companys 
movements on stage. The emotional roots of 
the motions were simple to recognize, in the 
twitching movement of a foot in pass, the 
-jerking of the arms, or the billowing cigarette 
smoke that would occasionally drift from the 
mouth of a dancer. The general idea was to 
interpret the daily frustrations of life as a kind of 
hell, an urban hell of responsibility and deadlines.
The latter parts of the show consisted of faster 
movements and freer motion, allowing the 
dancers to fling themselves into the choreography 
in controlled abandon. There was a very precise 
limpness to the steps, except for breaks within 
some of the numbers, when classical music 
interrupted the scene and the performers altered 
their style of dance accordingly. Bright spots in 
the choreography, opposite the starker, more 
minimalist styles of dance found in the opening 
number, included a dance in which clean lines 
came through in complete clarity. Performed in 
the nude, this section of the show offered both 
synchronized and contrast dancing (where a 
minority does something opposite a majority in 
choreography).
Close to the end of the show was the most 
striking presentation of movement, incorporating 
the concepts of paired dancing with the addition 
of a "seventh wheel. The pairs survived, and 
the seventh died. The dancers rose and fell in 
great numbers, the pairs broke apart under the 
influence of the seventh, their members switched
 a tango of sorts occurred. The movements 
remained loose but angular, and Hell took on a 
feeling of lust, desire, loss, and solitude in its 
efforts to caress the viewers consciousness.
In concert with the movement were the 
performance's concepts in lighting. The opening 
number capitalized on the reflective properties 
of the stage's surface, which created the 
effect of depth and odd skews on dimensional 
perspectives. The effect was reminiscent of 
abstract art in a museum. The lights also played 
in numbers, sometimes representing and 
mirroring the flow of movement on stage, and 
sometimes providing outlines of formations for 
the audience's convenience.
The set of the stage was bare, with a single, 
leafless tree and a glowing archway whose lights 
were lost within the show. The music was a 
strange mixture of haunting natural sounds, parts 
of which seemed to be Japanese-inspired, and 
snippets of Beethovens Fifth Symphony. But 
the most salient parts of the performance were 
when the music dimmed to a low, barely audible 
hum, and the sound that took the forefront was 
only the dancers' breathing. The stomps, the 
landings, the brushes and sweeps of legs and 
arms against the reflective stage floors  all 
of these could also be distinguished, but the 
breathing, sometimes ragged and individual, 
sometimes in synchronization between all the 
dancers on stage, was resounding and worthy of 
goosebumps.
Despite its. generally abstract content, Hell was a 
solid and cohesive performance in which themes 
held fast while interpretations were given free 
reign. The contemporary style of dance, sharp 
and unapologetic, may be best suited for an 
audience knowledgeable about contemporary 
dance. Presenting a fresh twist on a theme often 
belabored, Emio Greco | PC's performance of Hell 
was enough to send viewers away refreshed, a 
little bemused, and pondering their own versions 
of hell.

About first-year friendships 
Dear Janet,
Im a first-year and I guess Im 
having an all right time at college, 
but I feel like I havent made any 
really good friends yet. I hang out 
with people on my floor, but we just 
kinda sit around, get food together, 
and complain about homework. I 
usedto have real conversations with 
friends from high school. But even 
that is weird now. What happened 
to all the great people and good 
conversations? Sometimes I feel 
like I talk to people on MMORPGs 
more than I do in real life.
Weary of Waiting
Dear WoW,
You know, I remember finding myself 
disappointed toward the end of 
my first year too, missing my best 
friends from high school and worried 
because equally important ones 
hadnt developed in their places. But, 
think about it: You knew the people in 
your high school for years, depending 
on when you moved there. Those 
friendships from home that you cherish 
didnt just spring fully formed from 
the ether: they developed, through 
coincidence, hard work, serendipity, 
and compassion  like all friendships.
Remember this as well: For most 
people, the beginning of something as 
daunting as a new school is a lonely 
time. Personally, I have trouble starting 
conversations with people, and I also 
find it hard to really let my guard down. 
If you find it hard to even start that 
initial conversation, well, the entire 
process obviously becomes a bit more 
troublesome.
Did you know?
But whether this part trips you up or 
not, how do you meet these wonderful 
people who, by everything weve 
been told, are supposed to become 
your lifelong friends and toast you at 
your wedding? Ive learned the best 
way to meet amazing people is to do 
amazing things. Find something youre 
passionate about and do it. It doesnt 
matter what it is, if you enjoy it. Just 
make sure its something where you 
come into contact with people. The 
living of life itself, as long as you actively 
choose to live it, will put you in contact 
with the cool people you seek.
And when you do meet someone you 
think is really awesome, what do you 
do? Just go for it. Reach out. Let things 
develop naturally. On the other hand, 
also recognize that were all busy, and 
there are some who are chronic flakes. 
Learn to recognize them and decide 
if theyre cool enough to be worth the 
trouble. ;
But honestly, I would just work harder 
trying to seek out the interesting people 
that are surrounding you now, in the 
school and the city at large. Theres 
no law saying youre married to your 
floormates, you know. Almost everyone 
hangs out with their floormates in the 
first year, or people in their buildings, 
but they were put there by a lottery. Or 
something. I dont really know how it 
works, but its complicated and mostly 
random, and certainly'not designed 
with an eye toward who your best 
friends forever ought to be.
Janet

Somebody took the Porter Hall sign that hangs in the

make a mesmerizing memento. But my question is this: Had 
the culprits already stolen all of the typical signs that people 
generally like to lift (Stop signs, the Beeler Street sign, no 
smoking signs). Or do the thieves just love Carnegie Mellon

The ins and outs of AB Concerts
How to find the right bands at the right prices
AB Concerts co-chairs Brian Belardi and Eileen Angulo have 
plenty of reasons to be angry. Dealing with recent budget cuts 
resulting in a loss of about $10,000, not to mention continued 
pressure from students and the community to put on a 
enjoyable and flawless production, Belardi, a junior chemistry 
major, and Angulo, a junior psychology major, have had to 
grind extra hard to make this years Carnival concert come 
together. Having selected Spoon, Oakley Hall, and Weird Paul, 
the two hope to balance the wants of the Carnegie Mellon  
student body and their responsibility to Pittsburgh's music 
scene  while still keeping the show free of charge. Read on 
to hear what Belardi and Angulo had to say about the logistics 
of making an AB Concert from start to finish, as well as the 
upcoming Carnival concert.
Tartan: Where and when do you start planning for an AB 
concert?
Angulo: We try to have a show booked 3 to 4 months before 
the actual date (this years show, for instance, was booked 
at the end of December). However, logistical issues like 
reserving venues for the show have to take place at least a 
year in advance  purely because it's difficult to reserve 
space on campus.
Belardi: The first thing we do is get a group of students 
together who are committed to working at making a concert 
happen; then we start looking into the band itself, setting up 
the stage and other technical issues, doing publicity for the 
show, and getting all the appropriate contracts signed. Its a 
lot of logistics that require months and months of work.
Tartan: Who decides what band to try to get?
B: In past years, it had just been the chairs of AB Concerts 
who had ultimate authority. This year, it's been different; we 
got our committee to vote oh who they think would be best for 
campus.
A: AB Concerts itself has a fairly large and eclectic committee
 around 70 people from all years, all majors.
B: After consulting this committee, we also "contact student 
organizations and see what they think of the bands the 
committee has voted for  we really try to make sure we're 
booking bands that students like.
Tartan: Do you have industry contacts that help you book 
shows?
A: No, just a middle agent. Middle agents are the 
intermediaries between us, AB Concerts, and the bands 
booking agent. They generally have enough power to get the 
foot in the door and make the initial contact, so that bands 
and booking agents will fairly negotiate with us.
B: These agents also assist us in determining who is available 
when, how much certain acts cost to bring to Carnegie 
Mellon, etc.
Tartan: Do you feel a responsibility to get a band that is 
appealing to a certain style or demographic?
A: Yes, AB Concerts has one of the largest budgets out of all 
student organizations; but with that comes the responsibility
of having to satisfy as many members of the student body 
as possible. Even though Brian and I do have our own 
preferences, we still have to book, A) something musically 
accessible enough that people would want to go to and,
B) a solid live performer, regardless of whether theyve heard 
of the artist before. At the end of the day, the goal wed like 
to accomplish (and I feel we can achieve by years end) is 
finding acts that are college-appropriate.
Tartan: How about a responsibility to bring in acts that 
would be good for the city (not just the university)?
A: Yeah, for sure. Its difficult to book a 2000-person show 
in Pittsburgh, which is the ideal AB Concerts crowd. This 
implies that the show should be a large enough draw for the 
community, not just Carnegie Mellon students.
File Photo
Last year's Spring Carnival concert featured Phantom Planet 
(above) and The Secret Machines. Performing this year are 
Spoon, Oakley Hall, and Weird Paul.
B: We try to find bands that are bigger than a show you would 
see at Mr. Smalls or the Rex, but smaEer than your Mellon 
Arena-sized audience. We think Spoon fits these criteria 
perfectly.
Tartan: How has ABs budget cut affected AB Concerts 
booking of bands?
B: In the past, AB Concerts funded shows had typically been - 
free to students. However, in the fall, we dedicated our efforts 
to appealing to a wide range of students, and subsequently 
brought Blackalicious, a hip-hop act and Andrew Bird, a 
rock/folk/orchestral act. Thus, this choice and the budget cut 
forced us to charge people for the fall concert. Right now, after 
paying for Spoon, an extremely expensive act, were about 
$6,000 in debt even after additional funding.
A: The budget cut definitely put a different spin as to how 
we interacted with the various levels of organizations this 
past spring. The early half of this semester was spent drafting 
budget proposals and appearing before funding bodies, in an 
attempt to scrape together enough money to cover production 
(which is money that ordinarily would have been there). We 
also had to look within Coffeehouse (an AB subcommittee) to 
help us fund openers for this spring.
Tartan: You mentioned that this fall was the first time you 
charged for tickets. Why do you try to keep the shows free?
A: AB Concerts does receive part of the student activities 
fee to present a show, so we have the philosophy of the free 
show. I like the idea of being able to give back to the students 
unconditionally, especially because several other events on 
campus go overboard with pricing tickets for other events.
B: We really-dont want to have to charge students unless 
its absolutely necessary. We might not be able to get U2, for 
instance; without charging, but student activities fees are 
already high. Ideally, we would like to make the most with the 
money allocated to us, instead of making students pay even 
more.
Tartan: Do you ever have bands turn you down? If so, why?
B: It really comes down to who is available on our allotted 
concert date, and how much money it costs to bring them 
to Pittsburgh. Even issues like whether or not they can 
physically make it to Carnegie Mellon can be a problem; 
Pittsburgh is an awful routing city, so bands will often go to 
Philly, D.C., and then skip directly to Cleveland, not leaving 
any room in their schedule to play a show here. In other 
words, there are an unfortunate number of factors that are 
beyond our control when we are trying to find acts.
Tartan: Some students complain that our bands arent big or 
cool enough, etc. Whats your responge to criticism like that?
B: We put on two shows a year, so its really hard to get thcfse 
big and expensive acts that everybody loves. Since were 
not charging for the concerts, we dont make any money 
back, and our budget is pretty small to begin with. For the 
Carnival concert, we feel Spoon is something that everyone 
can get into  theyre pretty accessible rock music, with a 
blend of mainstream and indie. Oakley Hall, who are touring 
with Bright Eyes shortly after carnival, has a folk and country 
influence. Then you have Weird Paul who is kind of out 
there. We really tried to bring in a little bit of everything this 
semester to keep everybody happy.
Tartan: Eileen, youve now been AB Concerts chair for two 
years. What has changed since you started?
A: The attitude of the committee, which I attribute to 
Brian, has definitely progressed. So has the committee's 
involvement with the process. Even though there are some 
things beyond the reach of our committee members, it is 
important that we follow up on what they offer, which hasnt 
always been practiced in the past.
This semester's AB Concert will feature headliner Spoon, with 
openers Oakley Hall and Weird Paul. The show is on Friday, 
April 20 at 8 p.m. on the GFA lawn (rain location: Wiegand 
Gymnasium). Tickets are free. Wristbands for the rain location 
are available at the UC Info Desk (two per person).

'Let me tell you a secret
SPIRIT Fashion Show starts strong, ends strongOn Recognizing Quality
Since 1987, SPIRIT, the student organization dedicated 
to spreading African-American awareness in the 
community, has commanded Carnegies catwalks 
for its annual fashion show, now in its 20th year. The
2007 anniversary bash, advertised under the tagline 
Let me tell you a secret," captured contemporary 
fashion from near and far. The show featured wares 
from Shadyside shops and South Side boutiques, as 
well as clothes inspired by trends in Africa. Two of the 
shows designers, Lara Akinsanya and Emeka Okocha, 
are Nigerian-born, and their designs reflect an African 
influence. Being SPIRIT, we really wanted to tap into 
the idea of what is fashion in Africa, said fashion show 
co-chair Louisa Kinoshi, a junior English major.
It's not just the fashion that was diverse. This was one 
of the most diverse model pools ever, said junior history 
major Thomas Lloyd, a co-chair for SPIRIT. According 
to Lloyd, the models represent a variety of ethnic and 
racial backgrounds, in addition to multiple areas of 
study within the university. The model pool was also 
uncharacteristically small this year, yielding only 35 
models. Weve worked with [the models] since last 
semester, said Lloyd. [With a small pool] youre really 
able to shape and mold them.
Let me tell you a secrefwas split into two acts, each 
including several scenes. The scenes in the first act 
were all death-related, ranging in interpretation from 
serious to light-hearted. The first scene, Die Another 
Day, was extremely entertaining; inspired by the film 
Interview with the Vampire, the scene's models entered 
dramatically, wearing black capes. Then someone hit 
the music, unleashing Madonna's Die Another Day. 
Models started to emerge from a giant coffin in the 
middle of the stage  doing what can only be described 
as a jerky, mummy-like walk which matched precisely 
the beats of the song. The pace was lightning-fast, 
which didn't give a lot of opportunity to admire the 
fashions, provided by the United Colors of Benetton.
For those that prefer entertainment over high fashion, 
Die Another Day was perfect. The pace slowed down 
a bit for the rest of the act, beginning with "The Soiree 
de la Morte, a scene based on Carrie. The scene 
included both an "In Crowd" and an "Out Crowd, and
 of course  a wildly possessed Carrie who strutted 
out in a white dress with red accents. The act finished 
with a scene sponsored by the School of Drama and 
choreographed by Roberta Burke, a junior drama major. 
Titled The Loud Silence, the eerie scene employed 
designs with an old-fashioned theme and carried 
distinct references to the lynchings that occurred in 
antebellum America. The scene was slower-paced, and 
again drama took center stage over fashion. A male 
model posed as if being hanged while he was slowly 
stripped of the black bands of cloth he wore on his arm.
The second act kicked off with a hip-hop number and 
started out strong. The scenes were a little less distinct 
in theme and certainly less cohesive than the previous 
act, but the models strutted with equal confidence. 
Between the second and third scenes was a fabulous 
African-style dance routine. In the rest of the act, 
models wore everything from sweet little dress numbers 
in the first scene (which featured fashions by South Side 
boutique Jupe) to daring lingerie from Victorias Secret 
and Fredericks of Hollywood. In the lingerie scene, 
"Angels, the designers made the wise decision to 
leave more to the imagination than Lunar Gala. Models 
donned fewer butt-baring bits and did more confections 
exploring color and sparkle, from underpants to baby 
doll pajamas to a very little black dress.
The final two scenes of the performance featured 
African-inspired designs, starting with the stunning 
patterns of L-Shandi designs, created by Akinsanya. 
Mainly dresses, the color and patterns used by L-Shandi 
were nothing if not new, and seemed like they would 
wear beautifully at a club or dinner party.
The show ended with as much power as it had at its 
start. The dramatic fourth scene began with a brief 
remembrance of the horrors of Hurricane Katrina. The 
models emerged afterwards, wearing designs by Spirit 
Africa and carrying a single sign of protest including 
the words, "BUCK FUSH, PEACE NOW, and FREE 
MUMIA. Part protest, part dance, part fashion show, 
the final scene woke the audience up. As Lloyd said,
We wanted to creatively ignite the passion of people.

Last week I read online in The Washington Post about world-famous 
violinist Joshua Bell, who decided to play in the Washington, D.C. 
metro for change. Bell hit the subway on January 12 of this year, and 
the experiment was certainly thought-provoking. To provide some 
background, Bell played for about an hour and made around $40. He 
was recognized by exactly one person, and a few others stopped to 
listen out of the hundreds that rushed by during the morning hour.
Immediately, what I thought about was the way I listen to music and 
how it affects my opinions. If a friend sits me down with their pick 
of the week, I'm in critical mode. If Im reading the I Love Music 
forum online and someone raves about the latest Michael Mayer 12,
I get excited and think Ill probably like it. Im not sure where these 
predispositions come from, but  more importantly  I cant even 
tell how much they influence my opinions of what I hear.
Should we experience certain music in the seclusion of headphones, 
or in a club with sweaty people? I think it definitely makes a 
difference, but shouldnt be a concern. I recommend having a sense 
of trust in your own judgment and response. The article in the Post 
emphasizes the fact that many people failed to recognize the talent in 
Bells performance, but I feel that many of the passers-by may simply 
not be interested in the music, regardless of when and where it is 
performed. If the best Tuvan throat singer came and performed for 
me, Im not sure Id find it interesting. Similarly, in this situation I think 
that the organizers of this experiment took for granted the universality 
of classical musics appeal and drew the wrong conclusion.
The people at LEnfant Plaza, where Bell performed for a little under 
an hour, should not be put down for having the wrong priorities and 
for being unable to appreciate "beauty. They should be studied and 
questioned to see what they find beautiful instead.
My sister is a violin performance major. Ive heard her play for 
countless hours back at home, and have watched her ability grow 
over the years. I can tell a good violin performance from a bad 
one, but thats about as far as my abilities go. I doubt I would have 
noticed anything world-famous in Bells performance, and it doesnt 
really bother me because I dont care to recognize the thousandth 
performance of the same old music by yet another violinist of the 
latest generation. I prefer a new music untainted by the staleness of 
repeated listening and criticism of centuries.

Poetry month
Events on and off campus
When T.S. Elliot wrote that April is the cruelest month," 
he must not have heard about National Poetry Month, a 
celebration of writing that has inspired events all over 
Pittsburgh.
This evening at 7 p.m., students from both Carnegie Mellon  
and the High School for Creative and Performing Arts 
(CAPA) are gathering at the CAPA Black B<px Theatre for a 
reading. Those participating will be sharing their poems, 
which are part of a collaborative project between the two 
institutions where students, created work for publication. 
Simultaneously, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh will 
host "A Multiplicity of Voices, A Celebration of National 
Poetry Month, a presentation by both the library and the 
Carnegie Mellon drama department. A second performance 
is set to take place from 6 to 7 p.m. on Tuesday.
For those 21 and over, a group of poets and musicians 
is throwing a fundraiser for James Deahl, a poet born 
in Pittsburgh. The fundraiser will take place 6 p.m. on 
Tuesday at the South Sides Club Caf.
This Friday, Flannery O'Connor Award-winner and fiction 
writer Kellie Welles will give a performance as part of the 
Gist Street Reading Series. Welles will read alongside poet 
 Jason Schneiderman, author of Sublimation Point. Check it 
out at 306 Gist Street, 7:30 p.m.
Junior English major Julie Brown is one of the many 
students who have read their work at events organized 
by the creative writing department. "The reading 
opportunities are very useful," Brown said.- "They give us, 
as student writers, a chance to share our work with the 
community and a chance to read our poetry and talk a little 
about it."
Brown is not the only student who has found poetry 
reading events to be beneficial to her writing. A senior 
BHA' student with concentrations in piano and creative 
writing, Adam Jaffe has also read his poetry in student 
readings on campus. Poems take on a different life when 
they are read out loud, and thats why its important to 
practice performing poems in front of a live audience,
Jaffe said.
Jaffe is one of the performers for the upcoming senior 
reading, scheduled for April 27 in the Adamson Wing of 
Baker Hall. The senior reading is open to all senior creative 
writing majors.

Suburbia, meet Disturbia
Beware of the serial killer next door
Three months under house arrest. Whats the best way to 
waste your time? Spy on the neighbors  obviously.
Last Monday, McConomy Auditorium hosted an advanced 
screening of Disturbia, a new horror flick that hit theaters 
last Friday. The film was worth its price  free  but 
probably not much more. Inspired by-Alfred Hitchcock's 
classic 1954 thriller Rear Window, Disturbia, tackled the idea. 
that someone is always watching and that every killer has to 
live next door to someone.
The movie stars Shia LaBeouf, best known for his role as 
Louis Stevens on Disneys Even Stevens. LaBeouf plays Kale, 
a teenager under house, arrest (ankle bracelet and all) after 
punching his Spanish teacher. For Kale, extreme boredom 
results in fascination with the lives of his neighbors, . 
including a sexy new neighbor. The neighborhood is the 
epitome of suburbia. But picture Wisteria Lane; much like 
any typical suburb, everyone has a secret.
Kale quickly becomes familiar with his neighbors' comings  
and goings. Setting out binoculars at most of the windows of  
his house, Kale spends entire days glimpsing other peoples 
lives. Soon, Kale begins to suspect that his creepy next' door neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse, Detective Tritter 
on House) might be a psychotic axe murderer with a thing 
for redheads. Eager to leam more, Kale enlists the help of 
his best friend Ronnie (vaguely reminiscent of John Chos  
character from American Pie), and, eventually, Ashley  the 
aforementioned girl next door.
What began as suspicion turns into a full-fledged 
investigation on the part of Kale, even as his mother and
probation officer insist that he rnind his own business. The 
last half hour of the movie reverts to typical, slasher-film 
style, with the standard nonsense. For example, why is 
it necessary to go into the neighbors house when he is a 
suspected killer? Obviously, thats the smartest thing to do.
The casting choices in this movie were rather... interesting.
A Disney Channel comedian (Labeouf), a California Pacific 
Sunwear model (Sarah Roemeras Ashley), and a Penn 
graduate playing the stereotypical "stoner Asian" (Aaron . 
Yoo, as Ronnie) starred alongside SAG Award nominees 
David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss (the Matrix trilogy), who  
played Kales mother. Lets be serious: Can anyone really 
imagine Carrie-Anne Moss as anything except a bad-ass 
chick in tight leather and dark sunglasses?
Although definitely not worthy of any awards, Disturbia is 
decently entertaining  sort of a happy medium-where 
. Hostel meets Club Dread. And lets not forget about the teen 
romance; it was a PG-13 movie after all. At one point, Kale 
confesses to Ashley that hes been watching her since she 
moved in. He describes, in detail how he's come to know ' 
her through her daily habits (reading on the roof outside her 
-bedroom window, working on her tan beside her pool in a 
bikini).'Naturally, Kales borderline-stalker behavior warrants 
a long-awaited make-out session. Creepy? Yes. Far-fetched? 
Definitely. Entertaining? Sure  break out of your ankle 
bracelet and give Disturbia a try.

In Factory Girl, acting trumps a flawed script
Sienna Miller assumes the role of tragic beauty Edie Sedgwick
Director George Hickenloopers biopic Factory Girl documents 
the rise and fall of the iconic Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick 
played by Sienna Miller [Casanova). The film follows Sedgwick 
from her beginnings as a sculptress at Harvard through her 
heyday as a Factory celebrity, and up to her untimely death at 
the age of 28. Though many parts of the film are fictionalized, 
several scenes featuring Sedgwick and Warhol, played by an 
unnervingly odd Guy Pearce [Memento), contain dialogue 
based upon actual.phone conversations and audio footage 
that Warhol accumulated throughout his career.
Sienna Miller  who prepared for the role by studying hours 
of footage taken from Sedgwicks short-lived film career
 seamlessly portrays Sedgwick, from her speech patterns 
to her characteristic swan-like movements. However, Millers 
noticeable effort taints her performance, and an hour into the 
film moviegoers lose patience and remember that she has yet 
to make a high-grossing or critically acclaimed film. Although 
Millers every choice as an actress is evident in her rendering 
of Sedgwick, Millers specificity detracts interest from the 
fascinating socialite she plays. Technically precise, Sienna 
Millers performance ultimately falls short of spellbinding.
Many Andy Warhol enthusiasts may find Guy Pearce's 
rendition of the artist strange and disappointing. Like Miller, 
Pearce captures Warhol's peculiarities, namely his lazy drawl, 
short attention span, and hardly charming capriciousness, 
but fails to intrigue the audience. Pearces overworked
interpretation barely exposes the layers beneath Warhols 
captivating exterior, and the overall performance comes off as 
forcefully indirect and unnatural.
Another insufficiently explored characteris the folk singer 
played by Hayden Christensen [Star Wars). Though never 
specified, Christensens character clearly alludes to Bob 
Dylan, who basked in a brief flirtation with Sedgwick before 
leaving her to marry another woman. This scandal forms 
the basis for the films most traumatic scene, the boisterous 
argument between a highly intoxicated Sedgwick and an 
apathetic Warhol in a New York City restaurant, a scuffle 
that ended their infamous comradeship. Here, Miller plays 
a battered, hopeless, drug-addicted Sedgwick at the lowest 
point of her burnout. Following this scene, the remainder of 
the movie plays like a poorly fabricated documentary about 
an era in pop culture so influential and compelling that only 
the most multidimensional and experienced actors could 
convincingly reenact it.
Factory Girls most damning flaw is the factuality that 
Hickenlooper [Dogtown) overlooks in structuring the film.
The screenplay shifts between Sedgwicks Factory days 
to the end of the era, when Sedgwick is committed to yet 
another rehabilitation facility. Instead of the incoherent and 
distant Edie Sedgwick featured in 1972s Ciao, Manhattan!, 
her unfinished, semi-autobiographical film, the post-Factory 
scenes in Factory Girl show a vivacious, optimistic, and
presumably drug-free Sedgwick. Aside from this technical 
error, the filmmakers creative choices and the sub-par 
screenplay elicited some harsh criticism. In an article for the 
New York Daily News, Lou Reed described the script as "one 
of the most disgusting, foul things Ive seen ... in a long time. 
Incensed by Christensens inaccurate portrayal, Bob Dylan 
threatened to sue the filmmakers.
Barely crossing the $1.6 million mark in domestic ticket sales, 
Factory Girl is neither a financial, nor an artistic triumph, 
though it could easily be Sienna Millers magnum opus. The 
casting eludes all cinematographic logic, with Jimmy Fallon 
playing Sedgwicks pal Chuck Wein, Mena Suvari appearing 
as Richie Berlin (who in fact was not part of Warhols 
entourage of superstars), and an uncredited Mary-Kate Olsen 
attempting to fit into the glitterati of a Factory party scene. 
Though Miller upstages the rest of the cast as an effervescent, 
alluring, and eventually vulnerable Edie Sedgwick, Factory 
Girl sparkles on screen for but a short time until it fizzles into 
cutting-room-floor oblivion.

The International Film Festival 
marches on. This time, we get 
an Italian movie about a young 
boy who learns to appreciate 
the art of film thanks to an old 
projectionist at his village theater. 
Tons of archival movie bits, 
plus a healthy dose of longing 
for an old flame  and all of it 
set in the Sicilian countryside
 means that this movie is 
probably extremely beautiful in 
every sense of the word. Plus, 
Italian movies just sound fancy 
and intelligent; just sitting in the 
theater may raise your IQ several 
points. So do yourself a favor 
and celebrate the official start of 
Carnival 2007 by sitting down 
and reflecting on how great 
movies really are.

Closing the International Film 
Festival this year is the Chinese 
film Together, which examines 
the dichotomy between city life 
and country life, told through 
the eyes of a 13-year-old violin 
prodigy. The movie is a pretty 
typical coming-of-age tale, with 
the boy learning the meaning 
of love, individuality, and where 
music really comes from (heres 
a hint: Its probably the heart) 
as he tries to find success in 
Beijing. That being said, the 
score is supposed to add a 
great level of complexity and 
beauty to this film, and if youre 
at all intrigued by classical 
music, it will almost certainly be 
a fantastic experience.

Friday, April 20
You should be out having fun at 
Carnival  take a break from the 
movies. I hear Midway is pretty 
extreme. Or, you could go to bed 
early and get up at the crack 
of dawn to watch the buggy 
races. Or, if you want to be a 
real maverick, you could lock 
yourself in your room and use the 
extra time to catch up on your 
homework.

Darren Aronofsky, director of 
both Pi and Requiem for a 
Dream, tried something a little 
different for this one. Instead of a 
haunting and depressing tale of 
madness and/or addiction, we 
got a haunting and depressing 
tale of forlorn love. Flugh 
Jackman [X-Men) and Rachel 
Weisz [The Mummy) star in 
three different yet mysteriously 
similar stories spanning across 
three time periods (the age of 
conquistadors, modern day, and 
the far future). Its visually rich 
and has a plot thatll make you 
think; so, if you need to exercise 
your mind a bit as Carnival winds 
down, this is a good option.

a great way to prepare yourself to 
start careening headfirst toward the

feres the art?
art on campus is easy.

With a-gallery crawl coming up next Friday exhibits 
rolling in and out of the Carnegie Museums every 
couple of weeks, and the Summer of Glass less than 
two months away, its easy to want to hop on a bus and 
head downtown in search of local art. But if you think 
that's local, think again. Last week, the Carnegie Mellon . 
campus offered-student art in three of its galleries  all 
within walking distance of the Cut.
Findings
What do latex balloons, gold-leafed paper plates, and a 
remake of "Push It by Salt-n-Pepa have in common? 
Theyre all art, and theyre all part of Findings, the 
School of Arts 2007 MFA Thesis Exhibition, which 
opened Friday evening. Occupying all three floors of 
the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery in Purnell, Findings 
is home to the work of six creative, experimental, and 
otherwise quirky artists. "Its really a lot to do with the 
fact that were all kind of investigating, said David W. 
Halsell, one of the MFA students.
 "It's really tough because we all do our own work, 
added Lauren Frances Adams, another of the artists. 
Combining six different installations into a cohesive 
exhibit is a difficult task, especially without a curators 
guidance. According to Adams, Findings is atypical of 
most gallery shows, which would have a curator offering 
suggestions to the artists (where to hang their paintings, 
for example). Though the art in Findings is the result of 
several months worth of work, the six artists had only 
one week for installation. "There are some things that 
have been in the works for a year, said Adams.
Jan Descartes: Utilizing the entirety of the Miller 
Gallery's ground level, Descartess installation was 
a study in facades. Everythings fake, basically, 
Descartes said. Fake stuffed animals stick halfway into 
fake trees; next to a fake log cabin adorned with fake 
wood grain. The result is something Descartes calls 
an adolescent aesthetic, an innocent, experimental 
style of decor. In addition to covering facades,
Descartess installation addresses the role of the media, 
particularly that of television. Its kind of inspired by 
my upbringing, she said. Growing up in the country, 
Descartes got her earliest ideas of social norms from 
watching TV. I think its a really relevant issue.
David W. Halsell: Halsell's installation combines 
video and sculpture to explore the world's most subtle 
sounds. Part of his installation mimics a record player, 
but not the kind that could play your grandmothers 45s. 
A metal rod with piezoelectric film tabs attached to its 
end rotates against a wall, effectively playing the minute 
vibrations and inconsistencies in the plaster. Visitors are 
invited to take a listen via headset. Generally, what all 
artwork is about is a relationship with the environment
around us, Halsell said. Also in Halsells installation 
is Extra-Sensory Wave Device, a video of two circles 
projected on a wall. The effect looks something like 
binoculars, and the projected images change in reaction 
to pulses of sound, traveling through both the air and 
floor. This is all below our hearing range, Halsell 
explained. .
David Tinapple: Tinapple gives the phrase awkward 
silence a whole new meaning. Also'on the second floor, 
Tinapples installation features two video projections, 
one of which contains footage of the 2004 presidential 
debates, edited to only include shots of the candidates 
breathing. The other projection focuses on the silences 
in television programs, showing a black screen 
whenever the original included sound. Tinapple made 
his own software to automatically edit TV footage for 
this purpose. Sometimes, he said, he watches television 
that way at home  observing only the silence. The 
videos are playing on the silent pauses of television," he 
said. Tinapple's installation also includes an interactive 
portion: Visitors sit in a chair while pressing a button 
at the end of a metal rod. After five seconds, the rod 
releases a mild electric pulse, which hits the visitor just 
as he or she is watching the previous visitors reaction 
on a television monitor. Theyre really funny, Tinapple 
joked.
Gunnhildur Johndottir: Johndottir also created a 
video installation, a work in three parts. "It's questioning 
into memory," she said. The installation demonstrates 
the blurry line between fiction and memory, how true 
stories can acquire a mythical presence. The videos 
tell stories from the artists experiences in Iceland, her 
native country: The first is a still shot of a computer 
drawing; the second is an animation; and the third is a 
video, a close-up of a stream in the Icelandic glaciers. 
Combined with her own narration, each video is 
reminiscent of a campfire tale.
Ian Ingram: Pop! Within 10 minutes of Findings 
official opening, a 3-foot-wide latex balloon lay depleted 
on the hardwood floor of Miller Gallery's third level. 
Electronic birds' feet writhed underneath the rubbery 
remains, part of Ingram's Birds Leap to Fly." Im 
going to let it die, said Ingram, whod expected his 
floating creation to last at least 30 minutes. Sharing the 
third level of Miller Gallery, Ingram combined balloons, 
feathers, eggshells, infrasonic sensors, and a handful 
of other unexpected materials to create his installation. 
Visitors could step on foot-shaped pads to control the 
electronic legs  the ones attached to the un-popped 
balloon, anyway. Ingram found his inspiration in nature: 
Some birds, like albatrosses, have to speed up to fly, and 
others need to climb before spreading their wings  but 
there's a third category. Certain birds just take off, he 
explained, appreciative of the metaphor.

---------------------------------------------------

Lauren Frances Adams: Adamss installation, 
called "Pushing Sisyphus," integrates Greek 
mythology, political propaganda, and Playboy. Serving 
a punishment from the gods, Sisyphus was fated to 
push a giant boulder up a hill for all eternity; the rock 
continually slipped downwards, preventing Sisyphus 
from ever reaching his goal. Adams's installation 
includes an outline of a mountain on the wall, in 
addition to a painted border, Labor Procession, 
created in the style of black-figure pottery (another 
reference to Greek culture). "Pushing Sisyphus" 
also contains a gourd-turned-speaker, which plays 
a recording of a former phone-sex operator reading 
transcripts of Rush Limbaugh. Additionally, Adams's 
exhibit includes a-form called agit-porcelain, where 
plates meet politics. Using glass paints, Adams 
decorated paper plates in appropriated Target designs. 
Interested in creating opposition, Adams adorned the 
back of each plate with a golf-leafed political slogan; 
one of them says, "Proletarians of all countries unite."
Monomania
Friday night around 7:30 p.m., while the opening 
reception for Findings was winding down, that for 
Monomania was just getting started. The latest exhibit 
to hit The Frame, Monomania is the collaborative effort 
of seniors Lisa Huyett, Jen Mills, and Juliet Pusateri.
The three have been living together since their 
sophomore year, all the while feeding off of each other's 
support, inspiration, and talent. We all connect so well
 just as people, said Mills, an art major. "My favorite 
works of theirs are the works that I can see them in."
Like the name might suggest, Monomania deals with 
obsession  what Mills called the artists' "obsession 
with life." While planning for their exhibit at The Frame, 
Huyett, Mills, and Pusateri realized that their work 
typically revolved around a few central themes. A 
lot of the work that I produce now is based on certain 
iongings that I have currently, Mills said. "It becomes a 
lot more metaphorical.
One of Mills most memorable pieces is a portrait of 
Juliet Pusateri, Monomanias third artist. It's so weird 
to see pictures of yourself on the wall, said Pusateri, a 
BHA student in art and creative writing. Pusateri had 
one particularly striking painting, an abstract work in 
deep shades of red. Quite unexpectedly, as the painting 
hung from the wall, its upper half succumbed to gravity, 
dripping down toward the floor. The result was close to 
serendipity; it looked like an intended artist effect, not a 
mistake. Also capturing hues of red and maroons were 
three of Huyett's stacked clay sculptures. Lisa works so 
well with this organic form, Pusateri said.
In addition to paintings, pottery, floral prints, and glass 
work, Monomania contained one sculpture that utilized 
a rather unexpected medium: pipe cleaners. Huyetts 
S.E.M. Rose (which stands for Scanning Electron 
Microscope Rose) involves tens of thousands of pipe 
cleaners. The piece depicts a rose petal magnified 
hundreds of times  capturing the bulb-shaped 
structures that line the petal's velvety surface. Originally 
on display at the Childrens Museum of Pittsburgh, 
S.E.M. Rose now occupies The Frames annex, the 
space of which required Huyett to alter the shape of her 
art; The original installation was more of a plane, she 
said, her hands cut from manipulating pipe cleaners.
A major difficulty in arranging an exhibit in The 
Frame is the necessary constraint on time. The three
artists were unable to begin arranging their work until 
Thursday evening, only 24 hours before the show would 
open. "We really discussed each and every piece that 
went up on the wall, explained Huyett, also an art. 
major. "It's actually really well dispersed. Each wall in 
the main gallery contains at least one work of art from 
Huyett, Mills, and Pusateri.
Free paintings by Ali Spagnola
Turtles, bunnies, robots, and toilets  you want it,
Ali Spagnola will paint it. A senior in the School of 
Art, Spagnola is taking requests for "12" by 12" acrylic 
paintings  free of charge. The philosophy? Art is 
priceless. Plus, Spagnola hopes to gain experience in 
painting by fielding as many requests as possible. "Im 
a sculpture major, so we don't usually do paintings, she 
said. I'm getting faster at it.
Spagnola started giving away her art after taking a 
trip to Italy; she had to leave a collection of sculptures 
behind because she couldnt take them back on 
the plane. Giving away artwork isnt had, Spagnola 
explained, as long as you don't get too-attached.
Spagnola is willing to recreate one of the paintings 
she's already made (available at her online gallery, 
alispagnola.com), in addition to starting something new. 
Some [requests] are more frustrating than others," she 
said. Done on canvas, Spagnola's paintings all reflect 
a pop art influence (bright colors, cheerfulness), and 
depict, for the most part, a mix between cute animals 
and inanimate objects.
As for public interest, Spagnolas endeavor has proven 
a success. Shes been doing well with donations, which 
she accepts both online and in person! About half 
of her requests are from art fans outside of Carnegie 
Mellon, the farthest yet coming from Washington state. 
And good for them  Spagnola pays for shipping 
costs as well. Spagnola is preparing to take down her 
exhibit in the UC Gallery, but it looks like other people 
have done most of the work for her. With Spagnolas 
permission, visitors have taken free paintings directly 
off the wall  someone even took the sign that said 
"free paintings." Spagnola continues to take requests, 
but keep one'thing in mind: She probably wont get to it 
until after Carnival.
The Regina Gouger Miller Gallery is open Tuesday 
through Sunday, 11:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Findings will run 
through May 4.
The Frame is open daily 12-5 p.m. Monomania will run 
through Wednesday at 5 p.m.

As the School of Drama gears toward a more progressive . 
repertoire, this seasons production of The Oresteia Project 
is a breathing example of cutting-edge theater. Each show 
reflects a trend in experimental theater, and the whole 
construct is a creative process of collaboration, innovation, and 
experimentation. The trilogy takes place in unconventional 
locations: the Purnell lobby, the Philip Chosky Theater, and the 
backstage of the Chosky. With tastes of Butoh and Kathakali 
dance, Sufi spinning, medical procedures, sacrificial rituals, 
rappelling, demons, and 1960s home life, this trilogy literally 
and figuratively transcends time, space, and reason.
The Oresteia, written by Aeschylus in the 5th century BCE, 
is the only Athenian trilogy to survive completely. The trilogy 
follows the curse on the house of Atreus through generations 
of rape, deceit, incest, murder, sacrifice, feeding people their 
own children in a stew  basically chaos. Under the meddling 
guidance of Apollo, each of the deceased must invariably kill 
another member of the family. The curse comes to a halt when 
Orestes avenges his fathers death by killing his own mother. 
The question arises: Must he be avenged for killing his mother, 
or was he simply ending the curse by avenging his father?
Agamemnon, the first part of the trilogy, focuses on revenge, 
blood, and sacrifice. Taking place in the Purnell lobby, the 
show leaves little to the imagination. The lobby is cloaked 
with, a tapestry of crude and bloodied baby clothes meant to 
symbolize the spilt blood of innocents in the house of Atreus.
-While the "gld man" chorus orates most of the story, the
directors, Jed Allen Harris and Matthew Gray, chose to create a 
demon chorus to visually explain the curse.
The Choephorae follows in the style of avant-garde director 
Robert Wilson, who studies autistic children. Autistic children 
have no sense of empathy; they are unable to separate 
impulse from action. Slow, and elegant movement relates this 
association between Orestes and an autistic child. As for the 
setting, The Choephorae is performed in an intimate version 
of the Chosky. The costumes, movement, and music are each 
a fusion of cultural elements from Nepal, Tibet, India, Russia, 
and Bulgaria. Encompassing a smattering of cultures, The 
Choephorae creates an unprecedented conversation between 
the gods and the mortals. We see a visual introduction of 
Orientalism in the juxtaposition of western and primitive 
characters; the gods and Aegisthus are clothed in modern-day 
suits, whereas the Greeks are in Japanese and Middle 
Eastern clothing. These seemingly disjointed symbols in The 
Choephorae justify themselves in the final show of the trilogy.
The Eumenides is an examination of shame culture.
Orestes, the tragic hero, shoulders the guilt of the whole 
community. Based on the work of the Wooster Group (an 
avant-garde theater company), the performance is by far the 
most controversial of the three. The original text is undeniably 
misogynistic and, when performed in the 21st century, 
such issues cannot hide. The direction was an unexpected 
manipulation of the text that confronted these gender issues 
and modernized the conflict. For example, the male musical 
theater majors played the furies in drag. The production is set 
in the backstage of the Chosky theater, and what results is an 
interesting collage of different media and time periods. From 
references to both movies and YouTube to scenes imitating 
game shows, The Eumenides is quite modernized.
The Oresteia Project is the child of so many ideas and 
perceptions  its a spirited manifestation of postmodernism 
and the avant-garde at its best. While this production may be a 
time commitment, each installation is a visual feast and should 
inspire days of contemplation.

Judge a book by its cover
Designer John Gall visits campus
They're simple: facts that we are meant to read, take in, think 
about. Books published in 2006:180,000. Books that have really 
nice covers (according to the American Institute of Graphic 
Arts): 50. Books covered in human flesh in the Harvard Library: 
two. Jumping off that fact, he begins, "So, I design book 
covers."
Brought to campus this past Thursday as part of the Design 
Lecture Series, Gall is the vice president and art director for 
Vintage/Anchor Books, an imprint (a brand name under a 
publishing company) of Alfred A. Knopf. Alfred A. Knopf is a 
publishing group within Random House Inc., a company 
owned by Bertelsmann Corporation. Gall's imprint publishes 
approximately 200 books per year.
man with a floating, dismembered head. According to Gall, if 
you read the book, these will each make sense.
Another story he tells begins with the idea of reprinting each 
of Vladimir Nabokov's novels for the 50th anniversary of Lolita. 
Three years after the original proposal  and after Gall had 
designed the entire set, each disguised as a specimen box 
(alluding to Nabokovs collections of butterflies), the entire idea 
was thrown out; the publisher would only be reprinting Lolita.
Following this setback, he then "retrenched and came up 
with a Lolita cover that he calls one of his favorite designs of 
all time: all the text classically boxed in the lower third of the
Gall keeps a mental archive of all the feedback he has been 
given and the reasons that covers fail, from: Can that platypus 
look more human? to The authors psychic likes the image 
but thinks it should be more blue. Sometimes, however, - 
authors actually do love the designs; a quote from one of his 
clients: "I love it, it made me pee!
Gall has two methods for designing covers. The first exemplifies 
what we think of as art; it is purely conceptual, a mode that 
allows him to stare out the window all day and have people 
assume he is thinking really deep thoughts. The other, for when 
the windows of his office fail to inspire him, is to sift through the 
treasures of things hes collected over the years.
He moves through slide after slide quickly, 
providing a constant flow of imagery from 
classics to modern masters. He is able to 
describe the work he does as allowing 
him to create covers, with unicorns, with 
Mountain Man Dance Moves (part of the 
McSweeneys series), and even covers 
that practically design themselves, like 
the classic picture of suburbia on the 
cover of Allan Gurganuss White People.
But throughout, he fills in the details of what makes him 
successful: Have a clear concept  say what it is, and 
possibly contribute to the editorial content  and aim to 
attract attention. He tells us that he reads nearly every book 
he designs, and we trust him. The audience loves listening 
to him; he is quiet and somewhat quirky. You can tell that he 
would be much more comfortable with a stack of books in his 
office than here in front of this room.
But regardless of his reservations, he walks the audience 
through several of the possible designs for The Verificationist 
(Donald Antrim), including large graphic pancakes, a crying 
baby, two men who ... may or may not be wrestling, and a 
compromise between the aforementioned giant pancakes and 
the Bruegel painting that graced the original hardcover. He 
then showed the final design for the paperback: a pictogram
The authors psychic likes the image but 
thinks it should be more blue.
cover, and the rest taken up by perfect, porcelain lips, rotated 
90 counterclockwise. But he says, "After a day or so everyone 
started to get a little queasy looking at it, myself included.
So they took out the twist, and put the face on straight  a 
cover that was later described by the New York Post as Lolita's 
"raciest cover yet.
We can see that the reworking process is constant. Gall says he 
is convinced that secret meetings are held among higher-ups, 
which further add to the complications of accepting a covers 
design, on top of the already laborious approval process. Gall 
sends his designs to the editor, to the editor-in-chief, to the 
associate publisher, to the publisher, to. the author and the 
authors agent and the authors spouse, and really anyone else 
who might have something to say about the proposed cover
 each viewer gets to voice an opinion.
A perfect example of the latter is Galls cover for Thomas 
Lewis's A General Theory of Love, designed around a 
photograph of chairs, one leaning against the other in just 
that loving nudge that allows two stark wooden chairs to 
give you the same warm fuzzies as pictures of puppies.
^According to Gall, he has a file of these photographs that 
are just waiting for the right book to be written. Of the 
5000 he claims to have, this is the first that has paid off.
But even with rejections behind him, Gall says all is great 
because he is "a very well-known designer in Korea. He 
jokes, [Im] so popular now that people will call me and ask me 
to do work for free! 1
Speaking of his own work, Gall recently published his book, 
Sayonara Home Run!: The Art of the Japanese Baseball Card, . 
which he wrote with Gary Engel. Gall also designed the cover, 
offering a collection of his collages, all re-appropriated from 
covers of other books, while also touching on a few other 
projects he has worked on: a banner for'AIGAs Urban Forest 
campaign as well as a collection of skateboards, which hedescribes as skateboards that kids will never buy (they are 
a variation of his collage work, and look a little too much like 
book covers).

Aftertaste
Kazanskys DelicatessenBeer in the Burgh
All the booze thats fit to print
In cold, rainy weather, nothing beats a bowl of hot 
soup  just one of the options for lunch or dinner 
at Kazanskys Delicatessen,
Kazanskys Deli is a small restaurant and deli 
located on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill. 
Kazanskys is a short bus ride away from campus
 a few buses even stop right across the street. 
Getting off at Forbes Avenue requires a bit of 
walking, but the walk is mostly downhill and the 
food is definitely worth the trek.
Kazansky's fare includes custom-made 
sandwiches, Jewish specialties, and hot meals. In 
addition to traditional sandwich fillings, Kazanskys 
offers some more unique items, such as tongue 
and chopped liver. The deli also sells a large 
selection of domestic, imported, and specialty 
beers.
At Kazanskys, you can seat yourself in the 
restaurant area in the back. The room is decorated 
with pictures and banners of Pittsburgh sports 
teams, and the room boasts a big-screen TV, 
convenient for those who want to watch a game. 
The atmosphere is laid-back  not ideal for a big 
date or an exciting night out. Kazansky's is downto-earth and welcoming, great for both family 
outings and casual get-togethers. The meals are 
delivered quickly, making Kazanskys a great -onthe-go spot.
However, the beef short ribs were disappointing. 
The ribs were lacking in flavor (and barbecue 
sauce), and, while the accompanying mashed 
potatoes weren't horrible, the gravy is something 
to avoid. Don't judge too readily here, however: 
This is a deli, not a barbecue house.
The sandwiches are hearty and filled with plenty 
of meat (I recommend the roast turkey) and can 
be served either hot or cold (plus, each comes 
with a crunchy dill pickle spear). The bread is fresh 
and the meats are high quality, making for a great 
meal half the price of an on-campus sandwich.
Kazansky's also offers a variety of soups, including 
chili, borscht, and several varieties of chicken 
soup. The matzo ball soup is a particularly 
delicious choice, and its appropriate for a cold, 
rainy day.
Overall, Kazansky's is worth the money. For under 
$10, you can get a filling meal and friendly service. 
Next time youre in the mood for a sandwich 
or bowl of hot soup, head over to Kazanskys 
Delicatessen.
Amanda Cole | Staffwriter
Kazansky's is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Monday through Friday and from 8 a.m. to 10 
p.m. on weekends. Its located at 2201 Murray 
Avenue in Squirrel Hill, and can be contacted at 
412.521.4555. Parking is available, and credit 
cards are accepted.
Carnival is coming, and what could be more relaxing than a cold 
one at a local bar? Below are some suggested locations for your 
drinking pleasure. (And, if youre under 21, there should be soda 
fountains, as well I)
Fuel and Fuddle
Long famous for its half-price food after 11 p.m., Fuel and Fuddle 
on Oakland Avenue is the closest place from campus to get a 
good brew. Fuel and Fuddles Beer Bible offers a list of beers 
(100 in total, excluding the rotating selection of drafts) that 
one must finish in order to get a little plaque. This marketing 
gimmick really isnt worth the effort as a result of some 
less-than-desirable beers (read: Smirnoff Ice, not even a beer). 
Contracting out two house brews with Pennsylvania's TroegsBrwery, Fuel and Fuddle offers a pale ale and brown ale at very 
low prices. Perhaps the gem that may not.be available anywhere 
else is the Scottish Skullsplitter.
Sharp Edge
With one of the finest selections of beer anywhere in the 'Burgh, 
Sharp Edge has half-off Belgian drafts at happy hour (Monday 
through Friday, 4:30-6:30 p.m.). Along with walls of drafts and 
bottles, Sharp Edge serves up some tasty burgers and beerenabled selections. Although the trip to Friendship isnt exactly 
convenient, Sharp Edge is a must for any beer aficionado.
Bites and Brews
If you're looking for some pizza and a beer, Bites and Brews is 
your destination. Connected to The Elbow Room on Ellsworth 
Avenue, Bites offers a largely American selection, with a 
rotating selection of microbrews on tap. Watch the game on 
the projection television or just relax; Bites and Brews has a 
laid-back atmosphere that does not cross over into cheap sports 
bar.
Church Brew Works
For the awe effect, Church Brew Works offers the best visual 
stimulant for drinking. The brewpub, a converted Catholic 
church, serves some good old Pittsburgh classics like pierogies. 
Unfortunately, the house brews are mediocre and the rest of the 
selection is dismal. However, it is worth at least a sampling.
Mad Mex
Offering Tex-Mex food down in Oakland and an admirable 
selection of brews, Mad Mex is often packed. It does offer a 
$12 take-out six-pack on some of its selections, which is worth 
taking home for some further oral stimulation.
Squirrel Hill Caf
Neighborhood corner bar with a street-level attack on the - 
senses, this cafe offers a small but respectable selection of both 
microbrews and imports at a fairly decent price.
Rock Bottom
If you're down at the Waterfront and need something refreshing 
to drink, then look no further than Rock Bottom. Although a 
chain, it offers some interesting concoctions brewed on-site. Its 
winter seasonal porter was quite tasty.
John Harvard's
Another chain brewpub, John Harvards in Monroeville offers its 
own creations for the thirsty shopper.
Bockstown
Bockstown flashes its selection up front with a wall of 
refrigerators containing everything from Belgian imports to 
Pittsburgh-native East End microbrews. Offering one of the 
better selections outside the city, Bockstown is definitely worth 
a stop after some shopping at the Robinson mall.
Fat Heads
Almost always packed, Fat Heads is'the place for beer in the 
South Side. The Burghers cannot be beaten and the selection 
is extensive, offering many microbrews on tap and always 
something new in the rotation. Fat Heads, like Fuel and Fuddle, 
offers a contracted house brew, which comes with branded 
merchandise.
Smokin Joes
Although this South Side bar doesnt compare with Fat Heads 
in terms of selection and ambiance, Smokin' Joes offers a 
sensible alternative if you need a beer but dont want to sit 
through the hour-long wait at Fat Heads.

After Carnival, you will never find your right shoe again. Your pants will 
also go missing, but that will be on purpose.
For only the second time all semester, you will actually turn in an 
assignment on time. In other news, Im hoping that Harry Potter 
dies in the last book.
Your friends will come up with a new, but rather insulting nickname 
for you. You will then proceed to bludgeon them with a fire 
extinguisher.
This horoscope contains the mandatory banana reference: The stars 
say you will eat one.
Don't trust the group of dolphins you meet at Phi. They want to get 
you involved in a pyramid scheme.
Despite the official rules, rock will beat paper.
Attempting to put a lime in a Coke will result in getting citric acid in 
your eye and a hefty lawsuit.
No one will say anything when you wear the same shirt three days 
in a row. You will, however, get a call from your mother discouraging 
the practice.
Shortly after declaring its intention to run for Student Senate, a flying 
pig will be killed when you run it over as you rush to class. And thats 
why you dont hit the snooze button.
You will learn the hard way that fire is, indeed, hot.
Not only will you forget how orient quotation marks work, you will break 
two of your fingers trying to describe what they are.
In defiance of your mostly unused printing quota, you will spend 
hours printing blank pages and becoming mesmerized by their 
pristine glow.
