ASSEMBLY TO 
BE ADDRESSED 
BY DR. CURTIS
Director of the Allegheny 
Observatory is on Program 
Together With the M. M. 
Stringers
TO DISCUSS ECLIPSE
Dr. Heber Doust Curtis, Director b 
the Allegheny Observatory, will he 
tlie speaker at General Assembly to
day. The subject of his address is 
"The Eclipse in Mexico. Other fea
tures of the program will be the play
ing of the Stringer's and recitations 
by Mary Power of the Drama Depart
ment.
Dr. Curtis is a noted astronomer. 
His experience in his chosen field 
has been long and varied. He is a 
graduate of the University of Michi
gan and, as a young man was a pro
fessor of Latin, mathematics and 
astronomy. He lias for many years 
devoted himself to astronomical work. 
He was ai member of the United 
States Naval Observatory Eclipse Ex
pedition to Sumatra in 1901, was in 
charge of the Lick Observatory 
Eclipse Station in Labrador in 1905, 
and was chief astronomer of .the D.
O. Mills Expedition, to the Southern 
Hemisphere, 1906 to 1909. From 1909 
to 1920 Dr. Curtis was astronomer 
of the Lick Observatory. In 1920 he 
assumed his present post.
The Stringers have been coaxed 
at other times this year to play at 
General Assembly, but they could 
never be enticed to the point of 
actual appearance. If reports are 
true, their music is worthy of the 
closeness with which they cherish it. 
The dulcet strains of the M. M. 
strings ought! to tickle tlie ear drums 
pleasantly.
Mary] Power has been heard 'by but 
i few of the students. Her recitations 
have the reputation of being very 
entertaining and with her personal
ity to vivify them, they are expected 
to receive a warm welcome.

Cafeteria
Preliminary Tickets 
On Sale After Jan. 3
Junior Assessment Must be 
Paid Up by Friday
Due to an error last week, announce
ment was made that the. sale of pre
liminary tickets for the Mens Junior 
Prom had started. This was a mis
take as the sale of preliminary tick
ets will not begin until after Christ
mas vacation.
The Junior assessment of $1.50 
must he paid before this Friday. The 
preliminary tickets will he $4.00, but 
if the assessment is paid, they will 
be sold to Juniors at ?2.50. The final 
ticket will cost $5.00 plus the prelim
inary ticket, so that the entire charge 
for the Prom will be $9.00. Each 
Junior who pays his assessment will 
be given a card signed by the treas
urer of the class, stating that he is 
paid up.
The Prom committee lias definitely 
decided on the favors anil the orch
estra. Both of these will be surprises. 
However it may be said that both will 
be far beyond the expectations of 
those attending the Prom.
As announced before, the Prom will 
be held at the Hotel Schenley on the 
evening of February 1. The best en
tertainment ever seen by Carnegie 
Tech students will be offered that 
night.
All Juniors and Seniors are eligible 
to attend this Prom. Better start sav
ing now for that Prom ticket.
A great many rumors have been 
floating about the campus regarding 
the use to he made of the Field House 
after the completion of the new gym. 
Investigation shows that nothing def
inite has been decided, but that sev
eral plans are under consideration.
The most prominent rumor states 
that the Field House will be turned 
into a womens cafeteria. The one 
on the top floor of Maggie Murplis 
would be moved to the new location. 
It is thought that certain advantages 
would be the result of this action. The 
foremost of, these is the convenience 
it would afford the girls living in the 
dormitories. The new location would 
work no hardship on the girls living 
in,the city. It would also be possible 
to accommodate more students and 
give them better service.
Another rumor is that the building 
may be used as a storehouse. This 
rumor does not haye as substantial 
a foundation as the first mentioned 
however. It is also rumored that the 
structure may be converted into a 
dance hall.
Langley Lab. will probably' be 
closed when the new gym is com
pleted, so that floor space for dancing 
will be reduced. It has always, been 
necessary to use the Union, tlie Arts 
Foyer and the Langley Lab. during 
the Mardi Gras and other big dances. 
Some weight then might be attached 
to the dance hall rumor.
Another story says that the Field 
House will be used to house some of 
the school work shops, perhaps tak
ing the place of the carpenter and 
paint shops at tho rear of Langley 
Lab.
Si Hoenniger has suggested that the 
Field House would make good mate
rial for a huge Are. It would make a 
great bonfire and Si thinks it ought 
to arouse a great deal of pep and en
thusiasm. Howevor, Mr. Orbin might 
object to this latter plan.
These are just a few of the many 
rumors floating around. Perhaps in 
a few weeks well know the fate of the 
old Field House.

ALMOST GET REVENGE
The capture of the Freshman presi
dents may or may not have prevent
ed the holding of the Freshman ban
quet last Friday night. The Sopho
mores are sure that it did; the Plebes 
refuse to acknowledge as much. At 
any rate, the efforts of the Sopho
mores to make the banquet an im-, 
possibility by tying up the expected 
guests occasioned a beautiful scrim
mage all over the campus.
The Sophomores gathered at the 
Field House at 1:30, according to a 
pre-arranged plan and immediately 
went into action against the not 
wholly unsuspecting Plebes. Parties 
of vigilant Sophs partrolled all parts 
of the campus ready to recive with 
open arms any unfortunate Freshman 
who happened to step outside a 
class room. In some cases aggres
sive tactics were adopted. One 
Freshman group locked itself in 
Room 115, Science, at tlie end of the 
1:30 period, and the Sophomores had 
to knock out the window in tho door 
and dive through the opening in or(Continued on Page Two.)

THISTLE BOARD ASKS 
FOR CAMPUS PICTURES
The Thistle Board is sending out 
a call for snap shots. There are 
many students on the campus who 
have interesting pictures of school 
scenes, football trips or other hap
penings. It is to these students 
that ihe board sends its pleaa plea 
for pictures of every description 
whether taken in Pittsburgh, Detroit, 
Washigton or elsewhere just as long 
.s they are Carnegie pictures.
Pictures of Poverty Day costumep, 
class fights, parades, scenes of Plebe 
razzing during opening days of 
school, and all other campus scenes.
Those who have pictures which 
they are witting to submit are re
quested to send their films to The 
Tartan office, care of F. C. Smith 
After prints are made the films will 
he returned to their original owners, 
therefore be careful to mark the 
films properly.
ANNOUNCING WINNERS OF

Poster Contest have been announced, 
and the judges have awarded prizes 
of $5, $3 and $2 to the winners. Mar
garet Weiland walked away with the
I first prize, Jack Frost with second 
and J. M. Early third. Some very 
clever designs were submitted. The 
best of them have been posted on the 
bulletin boards about the campus.
The Junior Girls in tho College of 
Fine Arts are going to hold p. rum
mage sale, somewhere In Soho, just 
before Christmas vacation, to help in
crease their share of tho funds for 
the WomensJ Prom.
Pennies, nickels, and dimes are not 
so hard to collect, but dollars are dif
ferent. The juniors had a meeting 
last Tuesday, December fourth. They 
decided definitely to have a rummage 
sale. This sale is only one of the 
numerous things the Arts girls have 
planned in order get together their 
quota for the Prom.
Dot Diamond, chairman of the Arts 
Committee spoke at the meeting. She 
said, Girls, we just have to have 
money. Go out and beg, borrow, or 
steal something for this sale. It must 
go over and we must make a success 
of it. Some of their slogans are 
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU 
DONT NEED BRING IT AROUND 
KOLLECT KLOTHESROUTE 
FOR THE RUMMAGE RALLY.
If you have, or know anyone who 
has any stray or unnecessary clothes, 
shoesetc. stored away in their 
rooms, bring the articles around this 
week or let a Junior girl know about 
them.
League of Women Voters 
Hold First Regular Meet
The first regular meeting of the 
League of Women Voters was held 
yesterday at 12:30 in Room 308 of 
the Margaret Morrison Building. The 
girls bought their lunches in the M. M. 
Cafeteria and carried the trays down 
to Room 308 where luncheon was com
bined with a discussion on the World 
Court. The discussion was led by 
Miss Spillman who graduated from 
Margaret Morrison in 1915. Miss 
S'pillman has a most charming per
sonality,. and the girls who attended 
the meeting are quite enthusiastic 
about the program outlined by her for 
future meetings.
CAPT. SHERRILL REPLACES
WALKER OF SIGNAL CORPS
Dr. Bakor spoke at the banquot of 
the American Society of Civil Engi
neers which was held at tho William 
Penn Hotel yesterday. The men of 
the Carnegie Student Chapter wero 
guests at tho meeting which was hold 
at 8 p. m.
The subject of Dr. Bakers speech 
was "The History of the Idea of Pro
gress and follows in part:
I shall show that this conception 
is a comparatively modern thought, in 
fact the belief that human advance
ment was assured and had its start 
about tho same time as the begin
ning of modorn scionco.
Tho ancients had llttlo or no con
ception of progress. We are led to be
lieve that they had no thought that 
tho growth of knowledge would nec
essarily improve humanity. In tho 
Middle Ages tho minds of tho people 
were not much occupiod with tho 
thought of human improvement; their 
minds wore llxod rather upon a lifo 
after death.
"It was not until tho time of Sir 
Francis Bacon that mon began to porceive that enlightenment and scienco 
would bring with them tho possibility 
of greater happiness. In the eight
eenth century, especially In France, 
the idea of progress became a convic
tion. The philosophers of this period 
felt that progress would be assured 
through the power of the human rea(Contlnued on Page Four.)

hand performances, and fancy danc

DEPARTMENT OF PRINTING
RECEIVES VALUABLE GIFTS
An article in the last Issue of The 
Tartan reported the Department of 
Printing and Publishingas having 
received gifts and loans of equip
ment of the value of $1,897.
The above statrnent Is erroneous 
as the Prosawork Division alone of 
the Department of Printing has re
ceived gifts and; loans of the value 
of $7,740. This represents equipment 
acquired through gifts and loans 
during tho past six months and is 
distributed as follows:
I Molhlo Vertical Press..............$2,010
1 Miller High Speed Press.... 3,800
I. Cross Continuous Feodor.,.. 1,800 
20 Pounds of Printing Inks... 30

The gifts and loans received hy 
the entire Department of Printing

chasable auywliero around school by 
Thursday or Friday. The material 
has been assembled, polished, boautified, aud sent off to tho printers, in 
whoso hands it now libs.
In the past, tlioro has been the 
criticism that the material put in tho 
Shilling has boon too morbid to bo or 
interest to tho studout body as a 
whole. This issue corrocts all that 
admirably. Tho poetry of Charles Mc
Carthy Is bound to bo liked by ovory

tho Broken Throad is really excel
lent. Tlio twisting Is dono so well 
that ovou tho girls will ho intorostod, 
although It is primarily a story to intorest; mon.
Tho Return, by Knthorlno Myers, 
Is another lino bit of writing, i\nd 
although It has to bo Consldorod a 
tragedy, yot it Is so interesting that 
oven tho Seniors, who oonsldor trage
dies childish, will like it.
Tho hook reports and editorials slip 
a llttlo learning and morals In on you 
unawares with tho result that when 
you lmvo finished reading tho magaln/., you Tool as though you had boon 
to a satisfactory movlo. had from

church orvlco, had moved along to a 
musical comodiy, aud had finished up 
at one of Dr. Ersklnos lectures. As 
tills Is all accomplished for twentyfive cents, you can readily soo that It 
is a wonderful, invostmont.
Tho magazine Is for Carnegie mon

STUDENT BODY OPINIONS
What'is a student body? What are its powers? What are its 
functions? To what extent should its opinions be respected? What 
are its duties? Is it passive or is it a seething pot oil activity?
These questions arc such that they never will be answered to the 
complete satisfaction of everyone, so great is the divergence of opin
ions of different people. To all questions there aro at least two sides. 
Again it can easily be said that there are two sides onlythe right 
and tho wrong, and ofliimes there is no clearly defined line between 
them. ...We may say what a student body should be, but it is only our 
opinion. Wo could define its power, but after all, somebody will 
surely give it additional powers and maybe take away some that we 
gave it. We may define its functions, but somebody else comes along 
and says were entirely 1 did', and tho funny part of it all is that wc 
probably arc.
But just the same, wo are going to take a chance. It is our 
opinion that a student body is a seething pot of activity, with ideas 
and determinations, and is always interested in seeing them function. 
It should bo more than a group of students. It should have an in
terest in all activities pertaining to tho college. It should have this 
intorost to such an extent that it is willing and desirous of taking 
part. It should have an intimate knowledge of all tilings pertaining 
to itself.
The very fact that there is a divergence of opinions on existing 
conditions should indicate that all is not well, anti when the student 
body with its heartfelt interest for tho good of Carnogio over upper
most, finds fault, surely thero is reason for deliberation and investi
gation.
Thoro aro mon in authority hero who say many studonts cannot 
advance sensiblo ideas on important matters, and for this reason 
many student disturbances aro ignored, and when important matters 
como up for action tho docision is loft to a chosen few who havo 
proven their ability.
Truebut why? Tho idea will bo advanced that tho students 
aro .just naturally ignorant and disinterested. Thoso students'admit 
that thoy aro somewhat ignorant, but never, never will thoy admit 
that thoy lack intorost. .And why, might it bo aslcod, aro thoy ignor
ant? Tho answer is in tho old, old contention that doors aro too 
often kept closed.
hast year certain articles in this paper mado a plea for an open 
door policy. As a result today many doors which; mod to be closed 
are open. But thero remain still a few closed, doors and it is bocuuso 
ol! thoso doors which aro closed today that certain discontent has 
arisen. In other words, by keoping these doors shut, tho student 
body does not know, and it (tho student body) is therefore proving 
to bo restless,
Along this matter there has come a question of policy within the 
ranks ol! tho Carnegie Tartan. Shall we express student opinions? 
Wo have arrived at the conclusion that we shallprovided it is for 
the good of Carnegie. And where will our line be drawn in this 
matter? What is for tho good ol! Carnegie and what is not? Two 
weeks ago an editorial came out that was not, but at the time it ap
peared perfectly innocent. After the article was printed it became 
evident that it was undesirable publicity. UNDESIRABLE PUB
LICITYtherein lies the answer! If tho printing of opinions lead to 
undesirable publicity, they should not be printed; If not, they should be printed.
Along this matter, let us consider the circulation of the Carnegie 
Tartan. It travels to every state in the union. It goes to practically 
every important college in the country. It usually finds its way into 
tho hands of numerous newspapers of many large cities. And therein 
lies tlie answer. We cannot let it be thought that conditions at Car
negie are considered bad, when nine times out of ten, these beliefs are 
a product of an uninformed mind, which has not received sufficient 
nutritionand nutrition in this case is information.
And so, as in the past, it continues to be the policy of this paper 
to get information from behind closed doorsy and we believe, that 
through constant effort, we are nearing a victory.
But, the Carnegie Tartan welcomes and even goes so far as to 
ask for communications stating student opinions.

SOPHS-PLEBES TAKE PART
IN MERRY COMBAT
(Continued From Pago Ono.) 
dor to cupture tlio lower classmen. 
Tho first ones through got a warm 
reception.
Tho Freshmen who had boen cap
tured woro confined in the basements 
of the dorms, sans trousers and with 
wrists bound. One Plebe provided a 
sensation by escaping and running 
ovor the campus in his underdressed 
condition. Tho Sophomores on guard 
had a tough time keeping their pris
oners in subjection, as they were 
continually) freeing themselves from 
their bonds and organizing rebellions. 
By four oclock aibout two hundred 
Plebes had been incarcerated. At that 
time a student council member dash
ed upon the scene to request that 
the prisoners be released. The Soph
omores agreed, the trousers were re
turned, and nil the Freshmen were 
given (their liberty, with the excep
tion of their officers. No one knew 
where they were.
But almost immediately trouble 
broke out anew. The Sophomores 
tried to compel the Plebes to remove 
a 27 from one of the girls' dorms. 
One Soph threatened to use a. paddle. 
A Freshman grabbed it. Other Soph
omores tried to take it from him. 
More Plebes came to his assistance. 
And for half an hour a heaving mob 
of ovor a hundred tore up the sod 
hoaldo tho Field ITouso in an eifoit. 
to got that, paddle.
Suddenly Sophomore Presidents 
O'Connor and Goodwin appeared on 
tho scene. They had been away for 
tho benefit of tholr health for a eou 
pie of days. For a, short time they 
looked oil at tlvo tussle without being 
molested. Then the Plobos noticed 
them and started down Woodlnwn 
avenue on tho run, the presidents 
with a lead of tvbouit twelve* yards. 
OConnor escaped, but Goodwin way1 
caught along Forbes street, and an
other half hours scrimmage ensued, 
with Goodwin this time taking tho 
place of the paddle. Finally the 
Sophomores worked the ruso of 
"Lets go home; its all over, and 
Mike escaped in a Ford.
The Plebe presidents were released 
that night, but not until they had 
been subjected to the ignominy of 
having their picture taken with the 
bracelets on.
DRAMATS PRESENT 
LEAGUE OF YOUTH
Play by Ibsen Will be the 
First Comedy Given This 
Season
Tho Dramats will maKe their third 
bow of tho season next week in 
Ibsen's comedy drama, tho "League 
of Youth." A dress rehearsal was 
held Monday and performances will 
begin on WedneHday.
It will bo the largest and most am
bitious production attempted so far 
this year and will probably appear 
attractive to many in that it borders 
upon tho farcical and does not pos
sess that sad ending which has char
acterized tho previous plays of tho 
year.
Like most of Ibsens, "Tbe League 
of Youth" Is a problem play dealing 
primarily with tbe political conditions 
of tho seventies. The plot is very in
tricate and displays somo very clever 
technique. The Drama Department 
is bonding all its efforts upon tha 
successful production of this work 
and under the skillful guidance of 
Professor Stevens it is progressing 
rapidly and promises to be ono of 
tho most effective of tho season.
Tho story deals with Stensgord, 
an ambitious young Norwegian, who 
leaves his native city, Christiana, 
aud goes to tho provinces to aeek 
h/is fortune. To further his political 
aspirations, ho organizes a league, 
of youths, designed to abolish tbe 
corrupt and aristocratic system of 
government. Since this plan does 
not fiourish quite as he had expected 
he becomes a partisan of the aristo
crats for tho sake of "getting on.1 
The play deals with his adventures 
after this move and is brilliant ex
ample of Ibsens ability .to fascinate 
an expectant audience.
The cast, which is extensive, in

Nkjht School Plays.
Four offe-act plays will also be 
presented by the night students of 
tho department on Thursday and Fri
day of this week. The program in
cludes "The Intruder by Maurice 
Maeterlink. "Op'-O-Me-Thumb by 
Frederick Fenn, "Clan Flarey by 
Daniel Corkory, and "Tho Dear De 
parted by Stanley I-Ioughton. Tbo 
work is being directed by Che?tov 
Wallace, Hazel Bock andi Mary 
Brown. The night students do not 
often havo an opportunity to display 
their skill and these performances 
should prove weld worth attending.
Tho following comment was re
ceived oil tho night school plays given 
last week:
"Tho worst thing one can say of the 
Night School plays may as well bo 
said at once: Thoy distinctly suffer
by comparison with tho plays of tho 
day school studonts. Well, what else 
could wo oxpoct, consldorliifr the 
amount of time the two sots of stu
dents can dovoto to tholr productions 
and t.o tho preliminary training.
"Tho Intruder was a hard play to 
got across. Maeterlinck ought to be 
loft to finished 'professionals, except 
that professionals will not do him of
ten enough. This production had two 
quite good characters, Verner Wasson 
as tho Grandfather, and Margaret 
Myers as.tlio first daughter. Tho oth
ers rather broke tho spell of Maeter
linck with tliolr American voices.
" Op-o-me-Thunib. was easier. Mar
garet McCarthy was distinctly the star 
of the piece, but tbo ensemble was 
good.
Clan Falvey was a poignant and 
subtle play of Irish idealism. It takes 
for granted some knowledge of Irish 
literary values; but with a picked 
audience such as the School of Drama 
draws, we ought to be able to take 
something for granted. To lovers of 
the Irish drama as the Abbey Thea
ter has interpreted it, this play is pure 
joy. Its lyric speeches stay with us 
like refrains of old songs. The com
bination of realism and a wistful at
mosphere of dreams and lost causes 
is something to which no other na
tion can attain. It is high praise for 
the Night School that they could give 
such a play adequately. Only the 
slight tendency to indistinctness of 
speech (chiefly in the otherwise well 
acted part of Hugh) left one wishing 
that the Night School had as much 
time to give to training as the Day 
School.
The last play, "The Dear Departed 
was slighter than the others. Prob
ably it was chosen with some idea 
that it might be easier. But after all, 
a mans,reach should exceed his 
grasp is a sound principle to hold 
to In choosing plays.-- Certainly the 
actors'did no better in this feebler 
play than they did in Clan Falvey 
and The Intruder. and tbe impres
sion on tho audience was not so 
good.
Still, taking tho bill as a whole, wo 
congratulate tho Night School stu
dents on tholr work, and flie School 
of Drama on Its Night 'School stu
donts.
CLUB MEETINGS
COMMERCIAL CLUB
The rejuvenated Commercial Club 
will start tho year with a smoker to 
be held this evening. A smoker Is 
a smoker, but a Commercial Club 
smokerah, that is the acme!
It is not onlythe privilege but tbe 
duty of every Commercial Engineer 
student on the campus to attend this 
smokerand this includes those af
filiated \tfith the Commercial Engi
neering1 Department. The gathering 
Is in charge of tho following men: 
A. P. Scheinman, chairman; H. N. 
Smith and L. H. Harris.
Part of the time will be allotted 
to a short business meeting during 
which a number of things are to bo 
taken up, chief among which is the 
design of the new emblem. Prelim
inary designs show promise of some
thing new in tho form of a key 
which those at ithe smoker will 
see it.
C. M. E. S.
The members of the Carnegie Me
chanical Engineering Society, at its 
meeting last Tuesday, had the pleas
ure of hearing Mr. L. J. Lamberger, 
of the Duquesne Light Company, give 
a talk on the "Factors Which Deter
mine the Cost of Central Station 
Power.
Mr. Lambergers subject was new 
to the majority of those who heard 
him speak, and the result was that an 
interesting discussion ensued after 
the talk. There was a large attend
ance at the meeting. Among those 
present were several night school stu
dents. It is hoped that the night 
school men will continue to show an 
interest in the C. M. E. S.
Just before the close of the meet
ing, S. Hahn, V. Senlcus, and A. Grod
ner were elected as new members in 
the organization. In regard to the 
C. M. E. S. recognition pins, it was 
stated that those desiring them may 
now place their orders with August 
Stigler, junior mechanical.

NON-DEGREE MEN WILL 
HOLD SMOKER THURS.
On December 3, 1923, the annual 
meeting of the Non-Degree Associa
tion was held for the purpose of elect
ing officers for the coming year. The 
election results were as follows: F. K. 
McKlveen, president; D. Eichelberger, 
vice president; F. Duvicari, secretary; 
Wm. Gooby, treasurer.
With the co-operation of the entire 
organization, together with the offi
cial representatives great things can 
be accomplished in this organization 
in the way of activities and social 
functions. The first social meeting 
will be a smoker held in the Union, 
on the evening of December 13.
At this smoker plans and prepa
rations will be made for the social 
calendar of the coming year. It is 
hoped by the committee in charge 
that an unusual number will be pres
ent. Added special attractions will 
feature the entertainment, and plenty 
of eats and Bmokes will be on hand.
Theyre off! cried the old lady, as 
she viewed the inmates of the insane

The first meeting of the Society of 
Industrial Engineers, was held in the 
dining room of the M. M. C. C. on 
Wednesday evening, December 5. A 
delicious supper was served, after 
which the speaker of the evening was 
introduced.
Mr. Francis Feelian, a representa
tive of labor gave a very instructive 
talk on present labor problems and 
the possible solution of them. He 
outlined several systems which are 
now in use and which are giving sat
isfactory results.
Because of his intimate knowledge 
of both sides of the labor problem and 
his wide experience in this field, Mr. 
Feelian is a very capable man to deal 
with this subject. He has been a fac
tor in settling many labor disputes 
both National and local. At present 
he is connected with the Department 
of Labor and Industry in Pennsyl
vania.
The keynoto in Mr. Feehans talk 
was "Fairness of Employer to Em
ploye. Tills, be states, is the ulti
mate and only lasting solution to our 
labor problems.
Tho S. I. E. plans to have speakers 
representing capital and neutral par

The organization was fortunate in 
having Mr. A. N. Cartwright, trails 
mission superintendent of the West 
Penn Power Company, as its speaker. 
He dolivored a very comprehensive 
talk on' the design and selection of 
materials for transmission lines, 
touching upon tbe various unforeseen 
.difilcultles and methods of overcom
ing them.
As Illustrations of some of these dif
ficulties and methods of overcoming 
them, he covered the complete con
struction of two of the West Penn 
Power Companys most recent high 
tension lines from preliminary survey 
to completion.
Following Mr. Cartwrights talk, 
there was a lively discussion, during 
which he cleared up many points 
about which the members were in 
doubt. Refreshments followed the ad
journment.
TEKNON CLUB
Miss Parret and Mr. Rich, of the 
European Student Relief Drive, were 
visitors and speakers at Teknon Club 
last week. They gave a brief outline 
of the proposed campaign to be 
launched here later in the winter. At 
the same meeting were representa
tives of Pitt and P. C. W., who were 
very enthusiastic over the coming 
campaign in their schools.
It was very interesting to hear first 
hand information of conditions in 
European schools and colleges. Just 
at present this relief committee is 
planning reconstruction work which 
will enable the students to help them
selves in thenear future.
A committee was appointed for Car
negie Tech, with Chas. James as 
chairman.
The meeting this Thursday' will be 
the last before Christmas and it is 
hoped that all members will sign up 
and be present.

The Neiv Architecture
A DISTINCTLY new tendency is apparent in architectural 
thought and design today. Architects are designing in 
masses  the great silhouette, the profile of the building has 
become of far greater importance than its detail.
There is a new vigor and ruggedness even in buildings which arc conven
tionally classic in their detail. Masses mount upward, supporting the tower,, 
accentuating its height. The new architecture is tending toward great struc
tures rather than multiplicity of detail.
Certainly modern inventionmodern engineering skill and organization, 
will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture of the future.

Floor GamePlebes Are 
Called Out
The Carnegie Tecli basket tossers 
are rounding into shape for the first 
game which is to be played a few 
days after Christmas recess. A stiff 
practice during the next few weeks 
will put the floormen in condition be
fore the vacation days, and Coacli Lublc is expecting to have short prac
tices during the vacation to keep the 
men in good shape.
Many of the football men are now 
out on the floor and showing up well. 
Among the best is Jimmy Robertson, 
who is keeping up his prestige as an 
athlete on the basket ball floor as he 
has done in all the other sports. Mefort and Goodwin are also doing fine 
floor. Mohrman has reported for 
practice, and with Captain Jimmy An
derson yet to come, prospects for a 
good team are exceptionally bright.
It is urged that more candidates re
port at the next practice, because 
Coach Lubic is intending to carry a 
large squad tliis year and chances to 
earn a letter are good. There are 
many men on the campus who should 
come out and try at least to malco 
the squad, because it is only by this 
kind of spirit that the students will 
build up Carnegie Tech into a biggor 
and better school.

At the suggestion of Buddy OvorED GILBERT
end a motion was passed to raise a

for a, tablet to the memory of Frank 
H. Ilaaren to bo placed In the now

which they expressed regrot at their

CAPTAIN GILBERT
Like a shy kid, lie arose at his place at the table and tried to address 
the multitude who were noisely applauding his election to tho greatest honor 
a team can bestow on one of its group. Maybe he messed the speech up, 
but he left the impression in the minds of all who saw him that he is a 
man who will lead his men on to the greatest of which they are capable.
Eddie seldom got his name in the big headlines of newspaper accounts 
of the games, but he was in the line fighting all the time, and the men who 
fought with him. knew whom they were choosing Saturday when they selected 
him to be their pilot for the coming campaign. Quiet, unassuming, but a 
steady man of courage, he has won the respect and admiration of the entire 
student body.
Congratulations, Ed, and may success attend you in your leadership!
ABOUT THE COACHING SITUATION
Judge Steffen, in his speech Saturday, declared that he would be willing 
to come back to us next fall in the same capacity as this year, that of ad
visory coach; and further that he would be willing to continue his relations 
with us on that basis until a satisfactory coach could be obtained to take 
over the reins of leadership on a full-time basis.
Now, while few people in touch with the athletic situation at Carnegie 
favor the advisory system as practiced the past season for a permanent 
arrangement, its continuance has this advantage. It will enable the Athletic 
Council to take its time in careful consideration as to who should succeed 
Steffen as Skibo mentor. A new coach of the required calibre will be se
cured if possible by next season, but if none such is available, we can get 
along very well indeed under the present system for another year, or until 
a satisfactory coach can be secured. That would he much better than hur
riedly signing up one'who would not be of the desired type.
Wally is as sorry to leave us as we are to see him go, but he Is anxious 
to have a definite coaching policy Instituted at Carnegie, a policy which will 
include a high-grade resident coach.
BOOM BASKET BALL
Have you noticed how the basket ball schedule in arranged to link, up 
with the opening date for the new gymnasium? Take a look at the cagers' 
program and note the almost total absence of. home games before the date 
set for tho opening of the main floor of the gym; and the fact that the TMII; 
game is slated for the first battle in said gym; and also the great numbor of 
home games toward the latter part of the season.
The current season should he a banner one for basket ball. Marty good 
players have reported for practice, and Coach Lubic Is highly pleased with 
the showing thus far, his chief worry being tho effects of the stringent study 
requirements.
It is now up to tis to see that no available material of varsity calibre Is 
J permitted to hide its light under a bushel. The tendency has sometimes 
j been for fraternities or other groups to discourage one of their number from 
! going out for the varsity in order that he might bring more glory to their 
| particular group in Intra-Mural competition.
Put Carnegie first! Dont play fraternity or dormitory basket ball when 
! you might be on the varsity, if only as a substitute. When fraternity and 1 dormitory competition is placed above that of the college, then it is that 
I the former becomes an evil, and ceases to be sportsmanlike in character. 
(RememberCarnegie Tech above all!

Look them over. A first-class bunch, we'll say. You have seen them often before, but not exactly in this light. You have seen 
these boys on tho gridiron, struggling for the glory of their Alma Mater, and bringing glory In more ways than one. Relatively 
light, they nevertheless have played hard, clean football all through the season. Never once did an opponent complain of unfair tac
tics. Our team is universally known as a gentlemanly one, led by a gentleman and 
coached by gentlemen. This makes our highly successful season a most worthy one. And no one will deny that tho season was tho 
best In tho history of Carnegie Tech.
Hats off to Coach Wally Steffen! Best little football mentor of the scrappiest football tenm within a radius of three billion miles of Pittsburgh. Any instructor of the 
math department can prove that by integration. We do not know how good Wally is as a judge, but if we were to learn that he can 
handle divorce cases as smoothly as he does
a football team, we would like to be his graphite dealer, for that is what ho would havo to use.All thoso who have not henrd of Captain Jimmy Robertson, please stand up. We want to ask him from which plnnet he just dropped in on us. It is rumored that inhabitants of Mars have not yet learned whether Jimmy takes sugar in his coffee or not. But it is common knowledge thero that Jimmy pulled the stunt which trimmed Pitt; also, thnt he made some runs against Notre Dame which mnde Rocknos sprinters look slow.
No one needs an introduction to Jimmy Anderson, who was captain of the tenm last year. He played a whale of a game this year, 
and as it is hiB last in school, his place on the tenm will be very difficult to fill: Jimmy wns one of the best interfering hacks 
of the year, and also out-punted most of the opponents he went up against. A man of Andersons calibre is hard to find on any team, even with tho use of a microscope, telescope.
gyroscope, horoscope, finest kind of fine-tooth comb, or whnt not.Obia Newman was Andersons running 
mate until Obio hurt his leg badly late in tho season. Wo missed him in the Detroit 
and Noatro Dame games, but there is some consolation in the fact thnt O. B. will be 
with us another year.
Mefort had a bad start this season on account of injuries, but after ho was able to get into the games at all ho sure tore through 
the opponents on ,tho end-around falays. The big fellow ought to be at his best by next year. Heros luck to you. Whang.Tho fact thnt Eddie Gilbert transferred 
from Science to Architecture did not seem to nfleet his playing at guard this yenr, for he played as well as ever. However, those Science men who might think othcrwiso will 
have something definite to say about this after next season, for by that time Eddio will 
hnvo become thoroughly acclimated to his now surroundings.
Dutch Zelt will bo sorely missed on the lino next season, as will Cy Comfort. Both 
of these men have been fixtures on tho team for a long time, and it is with genuine regret 
thnt we will sea them go. Dutch was always there with n cool, level head, while Comfort's !>op and Inspiration wns a source of profit to the team. Comfort's educated toe was also n big factor in Carnegie Tech football. Cy could always be depended on when it came to kickofTs or goals after touchdowns.
Every good team has some Individual on It 
who can make it laugh, and the boys nssert Doo Tnylor could make the dummy of Ramoses II laugh till it 'waB black in the face. 
But in a game thero was not a more serious or determined player than Doc. Ho played the center position to perfection.
Because Yoder 1T to be found in tho Dramn Department when not playing tackle does not mean that he only nets football. The way 
ho tears into the opposing lino would bo enough to convince the most skeptical. By
the way, Yoder is one of the heaviest mon .on tho toam, and great tilings aro expected 'ot' him next year.Purl Anderson may bo tho last man to 
nrrivo for an appointmentin fact. Purl nearly missed tho train on several trips this yearbut when ho gets into n game, or at 
meal times, thero is nothing slow about him. Como back early next fall. Purl, as wo will need you badly on tho line.
"Big Bon" ICristof proved that a tackle can be converted into an end in caso of necessity. 
At least Pitt thinks so. Ben received the forward pass that made a gain of fifty-llvo 
yards and paved tho way for tho touchdown that mado history. By the time next season rolls nround Benny will be n polished end, and then watch out, opponents IWhy woro Steffens plays so deceptive and effective this year? Mont everyone knows 
they were, but do not know the real reason 
why. Well tell you. Because Steffen had a man of Brumbaugh ability to work thorn.
Brummy could handle tho ball bottor on a fake play than any fullback in tho country. And ho had the speed to carry on onco he got loose. Wo would liko to havo you with us n couplo of moro years. Chet,
For home-grown philosophy or good storloB wo refer you to Chet liable. It made no difference what happened, Chet always had 
an explanation for it. Injuries did not stop Chet, but ho kopt right on plugging. That trait with hla expert knowledge of tho game 
made Hablo a very valuable end thin year.We don't know why Max Bastlnn did not go out for tho hurdles last spring. Ho gave 
a fine exhibition of hurdling in tho Carroll game. It is said that between halves tho 
Carroll conch discussed tho probability of sending an aeroplane up after Max to bring him to earth. Bastlan wns a vory valuable 
man on tho tenm thiu year, alternating between halfback and Quarterback.Pittman did very creditable work in n rollof rolo, both at tho halfback and quarterback
positions. Ho was a sure tackier, and for n 
little follow conld take out men fully an well

with an evon loss promising nick
name, namely Bernard Szold, who up 
fill last June was widely and affec
tionately known as just "Dummy." 
We looked forward to great things 
from him, but this Is rather taking 
time by the forelock, Hero itr what 
ono of tho Birmingham, Alabama 
newspapers say about him:
"The most Important step In Bir
minghams Littlo Theater movement 
has been takenthe selection of a 
director. Of course, a completed 
membership Js a desirable thing, but, 
unloss plays are properly produced, a 
capacity audience  could not compen
sate for the loss, because the Little 
Theater stands for an ideal, and In
artistic performances are a death blow \ 
to Idealism.
Bernard Szold, New Director.
The hour and. the man have met 
In tho person of Mr. Bernard Szold, a 
Russian by birth, an American by 
adoption, an artist by nature, and di
rector of Birminghams Little Thea
ter by choice.
"Mr. Szold is young, good looking, 
talented, artistic, energetic, painstak
ing, and competent. What more 
could be asked for from any man in 
any capacity? Ho was brought to our 
notice first by the man who has done 
such wonderful work in this line in 
New Orelans,' Mr. Hlnsdell. Down

that Le Petite Theater now owns its

"To return to Mr. Szold, for he is 
really tho big noise these days and 
hereabouts. Mr. Hlnsdell said Mr. 
Szold was the right man for Birming
ham and was so convincing in his 
praise that the board felt it just must 
have Mr. Szold to make the work a; 
success, so they sent a delegate down 
to Jacksonville, Texas, who caught 
him just in the act of signing a con
tract with that city, but who then 
spoke so convincingly and eloquently 
of Birminghams advantages over 
Texas that he dared not tempt fate 
by declining the offer made and so 
signed up then and there to steer our 
dramatic craft.

ing. Ho was co-director at North
western University in coaching their 
campus players, and the Betty Ross 
puppy players.
Studied at Carnegie.
"After leaving Northwestern, he 
took a threo year course at Carnegie, 
where ho distinguished himself great
ly. Under Mr. Thomas Wood Stevens, 
general director of the Drama Depart
ment there, and nationally known pa
geant-master, ho did notable work, 
taking leading roles in most of the 
plays presented.
"Carnegie seems to bo a great 
place to loarn the arts of the drama 
for to learn these one must practice 
them in a repertory theater, whero
they are practised in the greatest di
versity. When Galsworthy came 
there to see his "(Silver Box, in which 
Mr. Szold appeared, he pronounced 
the Little Theater at Carnegie the 
WORLDS FOREMOST THEATRIC
AL SCHOOL, which, of course, is a 
praise well worth having.
While a student at Carnegie, Mr. 
Szold did extensive outside work 
coaching the Womans Club of 4,000 
members, and The Twentieth Century 
Club, of Pittsburgh. He has taught
makeup, and has studied and experi
mented with all the new methods of 
stage lighting and scenic effects.
Star Quarter-Miler.
Fearing, (wo are still quoting our 
contemporary), that the men might 
consider him too much of a hi-brow to 
be capable, it must be told that he is 
also an athletic star. When the Car
negie coaches discovered his track 
ability, lie was immediately placed on 
the teams. Summing up his record in 
athletics at Northwestern and Car
negie we find that he was a member 
of the winning American team at the 
Inter-Allied track meet, and is holder 
of the Iowa State record for a quartermile, the Northwestern College for 
the quarter-mile, and the Indiana 
state collegiate record for the same 
distance. Inspite of these distinc
tions in a somewhat different line, Mr. 
Szold says: I am interested in the
production of plays, and shall devote 
the greater part of my time to that 
end. 
More power to you, Dummy, we are 
all watching you.
A Record Still U nbroken
At 5:20 P. M., March 8th, 1920, Westinghouse Turbine Established Worlds 
Record for Continuous Running.
Wliat Engineering Owes 
to Good Workmanship
r IIEN Wcslinghousc in^ .ailed a 40,000
K. W. Turbine in 
the power house of the Nnrrngnnsctt 
Electric Light Company, Providence,
R. I., early in December, 1919, there 
was no thought of more than the 
average weekly power house run. 
Abnormal weather conditions, how
ever, brought so steady a demand for 
power, that the unit was not shut 
down until March 8th, 1920, after a 
continuous run of 84 days, 11 hours, 
and 36 minutes.
This was especially remarkable in 
that the unit consists of two turbine 
generator sets, each of which operates inde
pendently of the other, so that the result was 
the mechanical equivalent of operating a 
single machine continuously for 109 days.
If space permitted, many astounding figures 
could be citedabout the K. W. 11. generated 
during this period, the water arid coal used, 
tho cooling system, the oiling system, etc.
For exn triple, to keep the genera tors cool, over 
18,000,000,000 cubic feet of air passed through 
them, which equals 2,000 times the total 
weight of the generators and their bed plates.
46,000 K. IF. U'estinghouse Cross-Compound Turbine Unit at the Station of the Narragamett Electrio Light Company, Providence, ii. 1.
Equally impressive, oil was pumped through 
the self-contained lubricating system to the 
bearings at the rate of 600 gallons a minute. 
Had the oiling system failed for only 30 sec
onds, the bearings would have been wrecked, 
and other parts of the unit harmed!
There is interesting history back of the 
operation of Wcstinghouse Turbine Units of 
3,000 Iv. W. and higher. Notable records have 
been made in many of the worlds great power 
plants, performance that,is a tribute to remark
able engineering and good workmanship.
