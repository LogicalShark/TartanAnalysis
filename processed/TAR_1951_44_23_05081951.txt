EditorialsAn Old Question
Theres an old question around campus thats never 
really been answeredwhy are the activities at Carnegie at 
such a low ebb? The question is especially pertinent now, 
when it seems that the slump has hit a particularly low 
spot.
We could give the usual platitudes concerning the situ
ation, reciting again the high percentage of commuters, the 
heavy work load, lack of spirit, etc., but the problem seems 
more fundamental than this. Other schools with character
istics similar to those of Carnegie have a high degree of stu
dent participation in activitiesstudents compete with each 
other for the privilege of belonging.
The fundamental problem seems to be one of communication.
To the average student, campus organizations are hazy entities 
whieh hold a conference or meeting now and then, probably do 
some good around campus, and get their new officers published 
in the Tartan once or twice each year. He has very little knowl
edge of the functions and purpose of the group and even less idea 
of how to go about joining even if he wanted to do so. This state 
of affairs is largely the fault of the organization involved and 
not the student himself.
A possible solution to the problem is an intensive activi
ties indoctrination program for the entering freshmen next 
fall. The student fresh from high school has a certain quality 
of class spirit which, if transferred to the college commu
nity and properly cultivated, could mean an end to the 
downward spiral of Carnegies school spirit. If there is no 
well-planned program, or if the channels of communication 
between student and organization are tenuous or non-existant, then the freshmen soon fall into the departmental blocs 
and most are never heard from again.
The responsibility next year will be with the activities 
heads. Some organized system should be set up next fall 
to prevent the loss of the all-important initial advantage.
Granted, the handicaps are great. Students entering next 
fall will be concerned primarily with the high marks neces
sary to avoid the draft. Freshmen and upperclassmen alike 
have a jammed schedule during the opening weeks. Yet 
activities cannot be overlooked.
It is no wonder that the communication and personnel re
cruiting programs of most organizations have broken down 
When some few individuals are called upon to do all the work, 
there is a tendency to do first things firstget the immediate 
work doneand let those projects slip which will only bear 
fruit in the future.
Suppose a semi-interested student does join one of the 
more active campus organizations or publications. For the 
first few weeksor monthshe runs the risk of being almost 
totally ignored because those responsible are too busy try
ing to carry the weight of the organization on their own 
shoulders. It is only natural that he becomes a member in 
name only for, with nothing to do and little prospect for 
advancement, he feels the activity is worthless to him.
And when it comes time to replace old officers with new, the 
organization finds it has almost no members qualified for the 
positions of responsibility. Thus the activity declines even further 
and those who do carry on the work have an even greater load 
to bear.
There is no simple solution to the decline of activities 
on campus. However, an efficient program of freshmen in
doctrination and recruiting on the part of the affected organ,  . , ,, ^ I years. For instance, there was veryizations would do much to remedy the lack of members, and little that anyone could do about
Late Spring, Damp Weather 
Reason For Campus Neglect
May 4, 1951
Editor, the TARTAN:
I read with considerable inter
est and no little surprise Justin 
Davidsons Sportscope column in 
the May 1 issue of the TARTAN.
The administration of Carnegie 
is pleased with the understanding 
way in which he wrote about our 
athletic policy. It would seem that 
the conditions under which Car
negie is operating its athletic pro
gram looks better every day.
On the other hand, I wish that 
Mr. Davidson had taken the trou
ble to think a little bit about the 
problems he brings up concerning 
the dirt piles, condition of the cut, 
tennis courts, field house, track 
and football field. -At least he 
might have checked with some of 
the people responsible for phys
ical facilities; namely, Messrs. 
Overend, L. H. Miller, Halferty or 
Baker, before going off the deep 
end.
The primary difficulty in keep
ing our athletic facilities up to par 
this year has been the unusually 
late spring, coupled with more 
rain than we have had in many
consequent lack of efficiency, which these organizations now 
face.

the dirt piles on campus when one 
considers that there have been 
less than four working days when 
the fill was dry enough to put 
back. In spite of this fact, the cut 
has all been back-filled and it was 
to be dragged today but the rain 
last night prevents this operation 
until the soil is drier.
The one point Davidson raises 
about the manhole covers is per
haps a legitimate complaint. They 
were supposed to be covered dur
ing the contests and it is possible 
that there has been some slip-up 
on these arrangements. Eliminat
ing them entirely is not feasible 
at this time because of the great 
expense of putting in a new drain
age system. After all, the cut was 
not originally meant to be a play
ing field and the administration 
has done a great deal to make the 
conditions there as good as possi
ble in spite of many difficulties.
Again, the tennis court situa
tion is due primarily to inclement 
weather and the high cost of the 
Har-True surface which we have 
used for many years. It is a transi
tion year for the tennis courts in 
that we are changing from the old 
surface to asphalt necessitating 
thirty working days when the 
moisture is out of the ground suf
ficiently to work.
On April 1, and each week 
thereafter, the maintenance and 
operation department has treated
the areas where rats frequent, in
cluding the field house. Accord
ing to the best information I can 
get, the one which was caught re
cently in the field house is the 
first that has been seen there in 
some time. At present we are us
ing the most efficient extermina
tor on the market and I am sure 
everyone who knows about the sit
uation will agree that this condi
tion has improved tremendously 
of late. Of course, there will be an 
occasional rat here and there but 
unless the city is rid of them com
pletely, I do not think we can ex
pect a much better situation than 
at present. We are, however, con
tinuing frequent use of extermin
ating materials and there is every 
likelihood that our war against 
these pests will be more successful 
as time goes on.
Mr. Davidsons comments about 
the condition of the track do not 
agree with those of Coach Hal
ferty, who reported it to be in the 
best condition in many years.
A football practice field almost 
always need attention because of 
the very nature of the work which 
goes on in such an area. I would 
suggest that Mr. Davidson some 
time take a look at the practice
Guest Writer
An Artists 
View
By Thomas Sedgwick
The second of a series of articles 
by students and faculty was writ
ten by Mr. Sedgwick who spent 
three years as a radar instructor 
in the U. S. Air Force. He at
tended Clemson College, Clemson, 
South Carolina, before coming to 
Carnegie Tech to study in the de
partment of painting and design.
If any part of the contemporary 
world should ^ . ...
be aware of its Si
own wonderful
potential for 
creative 
achievement in 
all realms of
human experi
ence, the Amer
ican people cer
tainly should.
And yet it 
should not seem 
strange that the Sedgwick 
phenomenal growth and rich en
dowment of institutions and phys
ical wealth of this nation have 
shaped the motives of its people. 
For, above all else, America has 
become a people dedicated to the 
desire for the biggest, the richest, 
and the fastest of earthly goods.
Function and Fashion
We measure our achievements, 
our very aspirations, by their 
physical rather than their non
physical dimensions. Even within 
our immediate community our 
status as individuals depends, for 
practical purposes, upon the ton
nage of masonry and steel con
tained in the places where we 
dwell and work, rather than in 
our status as human beings. Where 
function and fashion are the tests 
of every product, very little is

areas used by other colleges and 
by comparison, I think he will find 
our conditions quite satisfactory.
The question of a new drainage 
system is a major one and his sug
gestion that it is needed is one 
which would require considerable 
study. Personally, I have never 
been aware that the football prac
tice area was in need of additional 
drainage, except following periods 
of excessive rain.
I think it is a healthy indication 
when students are interested 
enough in the physical facilities of 
the institution to make construc
tive suggestions. I only wish that 
Mr. Davidson had checked, around 
with the people vitally concerned 
with these facilities before he took 
his pen in hand. Perhaps, for the 
good of all concerned, he will 
consider this in the future.

Think It Over
By Richard A. Ahlstrom
This week we ^hall discuss more 
practical matters such as:
How to Write a Term Paper 
The first thing to be done is to 
select a topic which will com
pletely bore or baffle the instruc
tor. This is especially necessary in 
order that the profound cogitations 
of the writer might be placed in a 
medium befitting their general lack 
of depth. If the instructor obtains 
any pleasure from reading the pa
per, it may unequivicably be stat
ed that the paper is a colossal 
flop, inasmuch as such pleasure 
would color the instructors ob
jective observations and would 
tend to raise the grade which the 
writer would receive. The abhor - 
ance of this thought alone should 
be convincing proof of the sound
ness of the basic premise of the 
soundness of selecting a boring 
topic.
Quiet
When the topic has been select
ed, it becomes necessary to find 
sources o material. By this is
meant that the student, we^honor 
everyone who pays his or her 
three hundred dollars with this 
title, must wander, usually con
fusedly, into some library. If the 
library is a well stocked one, such 
as the one here at Carnegie Tech, 
the student will probably wander 
around for two or three minutes, 
gazing with wonder at the amass
ed volumes of profound thought 
written by a lot of jokers who 
never had to write a term paper, 
and therefore learned how to 
write books. But sooner or later, 
the students scuffling feet will 
bring a quiet matrofl, all librarians 
are, to his side, with a screeching 
Quiet! The alarm naturally 
shown by the student will bring 
the realization to the librarian that 
here is a new lamb. A quiet smile 
(everything is quiet in the library) 
will light her face, and she will 
sooth the frightened researcher. 
Then with motherly affections, she

will show the wonders of literary
reference to the seeking one.
Large Cards Scarce 
With 12 inch thick periodical 
indexes to thumb through it is 
easy(?) for the student to collect 
a mass, fifty might be an average 
figure for a simple paper, of au
thors and -titles on small three by 
five cards (large three by five 
cards are out of circulation due 
to the emergency). With these he 
goes to the card catalog of the 
library and, if the library is wellstocked, like the one here at Car
negie Tech, he will probably be 
able to find a book or two from 
among the fifty or so, relevant to 
the subject under investigation.
Be Original 
Now, with the source books in 
hand, it is easy to write the term 
paper. The necessary data, such 
as the title, author, subject, pub
lisher and date of publication may 
be obtained from the title page. 
And with this information com
pletely and accurately in hand, the 
book may be closed and the writ

On Friday afternoon, weeks of 
planning and hard work on the 
part of fraternities will take form 
in the very colorful Float Parade. 
The theme of Mardi Gras is ex

this years parade, which many 
people in the past have claimed 
to be practically professional.
Preceding the Float Parade on 
Friday afternoon will be the Cor

Queen and the calls of the five 
class activity honoraries. The 
Queen will be one of the court 
of seven senior girls which was 
elected by the male student body 
two weeks ago.

The record-setting time was 15.3, 
one-tenth of a second better than 
the old mark. Holders of the for
mer record were Hammann, Jim
my Robertson, former football 
halfback, and Tommy Coulter, a 
man known for his performance 
as a Canadian Olympic hockey 
player.
Carman Outstanding
Hammann also won the low 
hurdles and figured in a threeway tie for second place in the 
high jump. His time of 13.5 was 
fast enough to win over Taylor 
and Welsh of Allegheny. All the 
others placing in the high jump 
were Gators.
Bob Carman was another stand
out for the Tartans, taking fhst 
honors in both distance events, 
the mile and the two mile funs. 
The times were 4:43.5 and 10:23.5 
respectively. A teammate was 
close behind Carman in both 
races, with Murtland placing third 
in the mile and Cooper copping 
second in the two mile run.
Johnny Luchok was victor in 
the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds

winner of the half-mile in 2:06.9 
minutes. The Gators took second 
but Alexnader of CIT placed third.
Tartans Drop 220
For the first time this season 
the Plaid did not sweep the 220 
yard dash. The best they were 
able to do was to place Frit Wil
son third. Fielding of Allegheny 
was the winner in 23.6.
Carnegie did not take first hon
ors in the 440 but managed to take 
both the second and third places. 
Boic was first, Price second, and 
Valias third. The winning time 
was 51.9.
The Tartan squad broke even 
in the field, taking three of six 
first places. Taylor threw the 
discus 113' lOVs" and was followed 
by Bateman of CIT and Spears of 
Allegheny.
CIT Sweeps Pole Vault
The Carnegie squad also took 
one-two in the pole vault with 
Biumfeldt and Bateman finishing 
in that order. Sapper of Allegheny 
was third. The winning height 
was 11' 6".
In the broad jump, Milligan 
managed to take top honors with 
a jump of 20' 5Vi". Mclndoes 
jump was good enough for second 
for the Gators while Luchoks 
jump won third position for CIT.
Three More Meets
The Gators made a clean sweep 
in the javalin with Respek, 
OCamp, and Kozicki. The throw 
was 171' 7". In the shot put the 
Gators also took first with a 
heave of 40' 9%". The Plaids 
Taylor and Richards were second 
and third respectively.

1 TUESDAY, MAY 8, 1951TAVANPage 5
by Justin Davidson
As was affirmed in the statement of policy only a few 
weeks ago, this column will gladly accept just criticism of 
its comments and will publicly admit any errors that it has 
made. Therefore, as Mr. March, Director of Public Relations, 
has pointed out, we must take the responsibility for failing 
to check with the individuals that he listed in his letter on 
page 2 before publishing the editorial of last week.
This column appreciates the problems of Mr. March and the 
Public Relations office in attempting to present as favorable an ac
count of Carnegie Institute of Technology as possible. Surely, if 
a check had been made, the comments concerning the rats in the 
Field House or the condition of the track would not have been 
made or would not have been given what is now seen to have 
been a one-sided account. For this we are to blame and we are 
sincerely sorry. ^
, Ideas, however, are not born in a vacuum. The criticism 
when made was not intended as an unprovoked attack upon 
the administration, nor was it made upon the spur of the mo
ment to fill an editorial column. The criticism grew directly 
out of the complaints which had come to the attention of 
this column from the student body. Especially in the cases 
concerning the condition of the Cut, the football field, and 
the tennis courts, it was felt that these were conditions ex
isting which should not exist.
In commenting upon these conditions, this column does not 
think it has overstepped the bounds of good editorial policy. The 
, error, which we admit, is not the fact that we commented, but 
that we failed to cover both sides of the issue. This column wel
comes Mr. Marchs letter, for by presenting his side of the argu
ment, the students, who are most directly concerned, can resolve 
their questions.
Whether Mr. Marchs letter completely justifies the ad-1 
ministrations handling of the situation is a matter for the j 
students to decide. On the one point Mr. March admits neglij 
gencethe danger of tKe manhole coverthis column hopes 
that something positive will be done. Whether the Cut was 
constructed for a playing field or not, the fact remains that 
it is being used as such.
Buggy PushingRegarding people on probation, the school rule has been
that no student on probation can participate in two intra
mural sports simultaneously. By the decision that a person 
on probation cannot push a buggy in the annual Spring Car
nival Sweepstakes and participate in an intramural sport at 
the same time, the annual buggy race has almost been 
elevated to the rank of an intramural sport. Whether recog
nized or not, the annual grunt and groan derby with the 
pushmobiles requires as much time and effort as any IM J 
sport. The mankiller push up the hill in front of the gym 1 
is the equivalent of any football game.

Plaid Defeats Geneva, 
Deadlocks Westminster
The Tartan gulf team proved to 
be poor hosts last Tuesday after
noon, May 1, when they enter
tained the Geneva College squad 
at the Pittsburgh Field Club. 
Playing in perfect golfing weather, 
the boys from CIT romped to a 
convincing 15-3 decision over the 
Covenanters.
Carnegie got off to a poor start 
when captain Dick Johnson lost 
his match by a 1-2 score. The 
usually reliable Johnson faltered 
to an 84 on a course which he 
usually plays in the seventies. 
However, Roy Ryabik came back 
to take his opponent by a 2-1 
count, and from there on it was 
all Tartan. Ed Denberg, Don 
Myers, Joe Holland, and Walt 
Kuehn all copped their matches 
handilyeach winning by a 3-0 
count.
Medalist honors for the day 
went to Denberg, who shot a 42 
on the out-going nine, but recov
ered in fine style to blast out a 38 
on the back nine, making his to
tal for the day a very commend
able 80.
Carnegie Techs perfect record 
on the fairways was marred on 
May 4, by a good Westminster golf 
team. Rallying to overcome a six 
point deficit, the Titan linksmen 
made a clean sweep of the last 
two matches of the day to earn a 
nine to nine tie with the Tartans.
The first two matches having left 
the score at 3-3, the Carnegie boys 
seemed headed for their third 
straight victory as Ed Denberg and 
Joe Holland each scoring three 
points to give the Plaid a 9-5 edge.

Tennis Team Downs 
Titans And Grove City
The Carnegie tennis team served up two big wins this week as 
they defeated Westminster College, 7-2, Wednesday, and Grove 
City, 5-4, Saturday, in away matches. The Tartan record now stands 
at two and one after an opening day defeat handed them by Duquesne.
In defeating Westminster, the*
Plaid swept the three doubles
intramural contests in years.
The remainder of the game was 
played in scoreless fashion, both 
teams exhibiting perfect defensive 
play against equally determined 
offenses. Bill Oxley for the losers, 
and Don Braun and George Pyle 
for the Delts were the outstand
ing athletes in the game.
Neither Could Score 
The TX ball club had several 
good chances to tie up the game, 
especially in the third and fourth 
periods when the Delt forward 
wall seemed to tire a little. How
ever, the stellar ball-hawking of 
George Pyle, the Delt goalie, plus 
the efforts of fullbacks Mac Mc
Nally and Derrick Van Schoonhoven combined to thwart these 
attempts. On the other hand the 
Delts just barely missed scoring 
again several times themselves, 
but they couldnt seem to get 
around big Bill Oxley and his 
teammates for that clincher.
National League Tie 
The winners finished the reg
ular season in the National League
in a tie for first place with Emanon, both teams having a 4-1 
record. Sigma Nu, with a 3-1 
record, was in strong contention 
until the last day of league play, 
but in their game with the twicebeaten Kappa Sigs, they were un
able to score, and after two fruit
less overtime periods, the game 
had to be called with the final 
score a nothing to nothing tie. 
Tom Craig, the Kappa Sig goalie, 
turned in a very outstanding per
formance as he made seemingly 
impossible saves again and again.
Delts Down Eman
On the same day, the Delts and 
Emanon played another tight 
game that required an overtime 
period to decide the winner. The 
Delts emerged the victors, how
ever, by a 1-0 score, thus earn
ing their position in the cham
pionship game.
Theta Xi was undisputed win
ner of the Amex-ican League 
championship, having chalked up 
a regular season record of five 
wins against no defeats.

The number one man of the 
Westminster squad, Whitmer, took

heels with 81s were Johnson, Ryabik, Denberf, and Holland of Car

Intramural Softball Leagues 
End First Weeks Competition
Faculty Team Shows Promise In Downing
Hard Fighting ATO And Kappa Sig Squads
The Intramural softball season got into full stride this week 
with a little help from the weatherman. The Faculty, Emanon, Beta 
Sigma Rho, and Beta Theta Pi each show a 2-0 chart as the result 
of hte weeks play. Nine other teams remain undefeated after playing
their first game.
The Faculty bested the ATO 
B squad 7-3 in their opener 
and went on squeeze by the Kappa 
Sig B 7-6. Sgt. Brown was 
the winning hurler as the losers 
rallied to score three runs in 
their half of the seventh. How
ever, a Faculty double-play ended 
the rally before it did real dam
age.
BSR Takes Two
The Beta Sigs had little trouble 
disposing of ASCE, 13-4 in the 
opener, but found the going a lit
tle rougher against the Citcom 
* B as they eked out a 7-5 vic
tory to grab the lead in the Tar
tan League.
Emanon looked impressive in 
pasting the TX B 17-8, and the 
Architects 28-7. Their victories 
gave them the Skibo League lead. 
Beta Theta Pi grabbed the Thistle 
League lead with victories over 
Sigma Nu B 10-4, and the
Dramats 6-4.
Sigma Nu Triumphs
In other Plaid League encoun
ters, the Tau Delts handed the 
Kappa Sig B a 6-2 defeat in 
the seasons opener and then 
dropped a 7-3 decision to the 
Newman Club. Theta Xi A 
squeezed by the Phi Kap nine in 
a 5-4 thriller.
Sigma Nu A pasted an 18-2 
defeat on the SAEs in a Tartan 
League battle. The DU's edged 
by the Raiders 8-7 in a thriller 
that was not decided until the last 
inning. In the only other Tartan 
League game, the Indians decitioned the ASCEs 7-5.
ATO Downs PiKA
The ATOs hung a 7-3 defeat on 
the PiKAs in their Thistle League 
opener. Webster gave only two 
hits to the losers and Bozo Rich
ards hit a home run to lead the 
ATO attack. The Kappa Sig A 
squad walloped the Grad Chem 
E's 17-1 and the Dramats bested 
the Sigma Nu !B' nine, 13-4.
The TX B squad rallied in 
the last inning to overcome a 9-7

Beta Sigs Lead 
As Pool Season 
Draws To Close
The intramural pool season 
neared completion this week with 
the Beta Sigma Rho A and the 
Sigma Nu cushion squads setting 
the pace. The Beta Sigs have 
swept aside all Eight Ball league 
competition to post a 4-0 record 
while the Sigma Nus have kept 
the same pace in the Scratch 
league.
The Beta Sigs won matches 
over the Scratches, the Dorm 
Dukes, PiKA, and the Beta Sigma 
Rho D squads to establish their 
supremacy. The PiKAs were the 
only team to score against the 
Beta Sigs, the final score of that 
match being 2-1.
Sigma Nu won matches over 
the Phi Kaps and Beta Theta Pi 
via the forfeit route. They also 
showed victories over the Beta 
Sig B 2-1, and the ATO A 
2-0.
The Raiders took first place in 
the Cue Ball League without 
playing a single match. Their
2-0 chart came as a result of for
feits from the Delts and the Alpha 
Tau Omega B team.
In second place in the Cue Ball 
league with a 2-1 record is Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon. SAEs only loss 
came at the hands of the Beta Sig 
C team which is holding down 
the third position. Both the SAE 
and the Beta Sig teams have yet 
to play the Raider*.

Biography Will Appear 
In Final Technical
Miss Edna Yost, a professional 
biographer, has written a sketch 
of the life of Dr. Robert E. Doh
erty. It will be part of a book 
containing biographies of great en
gineers to be published in 1952 by 
the J. B. Lippineott Co.
Material for the sketch was 
gathered by Miss Yost from in
formation furnished her by Car
negie Tech. She also obtained some 
previously unknown information 
about Dr. Dohertys life in an in
terview with him shortly before 
his death. The sketch has been 
carefully checked by school of
ficials to insure its correctness.
Although Dr. Dohertys life is 
sketched in its entirety, special 
emphasis is placed upon his engi
neering career at General Electric 
and his development of the Car
negie Plan of Education. Miss Yost 
presents a clear picture of what 
Carnegie Tech is trying to do in 
the field of education.
Because of its special interest to 
Carnegie Tech students, special 
permission has been obtained from 
the author to reprint the article. 
Students will be able to read the 
sketch in the next issue of the

Campus Still Split 50-50 On Removal Issue;
Eisenhower Gains As ?52 Election Favorite
The most recent public opinion survey conducted on the Car
negie Tech campus indicates that the speeches by General Mac
Arthur have had little effect on student opinion. The answers to 
the question, Do you favor General MacArthurs removal? for 
the two surveys are as follows:
Survey I Survey II
Yes.....................41% 45%
No.......................41% 47%
Undecided ___18% 8%
Survey I was conducted April 
17-18, inclusive, and before MacArhturs address to Congress. Sur
vey II was conducted April 25- 
May 2. This provided a means of 
measuring opinion before and 
after the speeches by the Old 
Soldier.
No Change
In addition to the above, four 
other controversial questions were 
asked. No significant change of 
opinion was revealed by the sec
ond survey, except that the pro
portion of undecided seems to 
have decreased. The results of 
these questions are as follows:
Do you believe that the ground 
war should be restricted to the 
Korean Peninsula?
Survey 1 Survey II
Yes .....................60% 62%
No.........................25% 24%
Undecided ....15% 14%
Do you believe that the air war 
should be restricted to the Korean 
Peninsula?
Survey 1 Survey n
i Yes .......................38% 43%
No .......................49% 40%
Undecided ___13% 17%
How far should the air war be 
extended? (Asked only to those 
answering no to the above uestion).
Survey 1 Survey n 
As far as neces
sary ................11%
Manchurian bas
es and sup
plies ......52%
China proper .21%
At the discretion 
of the mili
tary ....................16%
Do you favor the use of Chinese 
Nationalist troops against the Chi
nese mainland
Survey 1
Yes .....................45%
No ......................38%
Undecided ___17%
In addition the survey group at
tempted to predict the presidenial 
favorite in 1952. In the first surSurvey n 
49%
38%
13%
vey Eisenhower was named by 
19% of the students, Taft by 13%, 
and Truman by 2%. The second 
gave Eisenhower 23% of the votes, 
Taft 7%, and Harry failed to get 
a single vote. Other students nam
ed Warren, Stassen, Douglas, and 
Duff.
Both these surveys seemed to 
indicate a degree of irrational 
thinking on the part of the stu
dents. For example , a further 
breakdown of the results showed 
that one-fourth of the students 
who were opposed to MacArthurs 
removal' wanted the ground war 
restricted to the Korean Peninsula. 
These students were admittedly 
against MacArthurs ideas, yet 
they j did not favor Trumans ac| tions.
Irrational Thinking:
Time restrictions made it nec
essary to ask the questions so that 
the person interviewed had little 
opportunity to explain the reason
ing behind his answers. It is ad
mittedly that sound arguments 
may be found to support a seem
ingly irrational response, as the 
one just sighted. However, a lew 
students, found more frequently 
among the women, seemed to have 
given little consideration to this 
important national issue. In the 
same token, some male veterans 
of the Pacific theatre favored Mac
Arthurs removal regardless of the 
issues involved.
Prevent War
Many of the students specified 
that they want the policy and ac
tion to be directed toward the 
prevention of World War III. They 
further indicated that their an
swers were based on what they 
had heard through public sources, 
while more detailed facts may 
change their answers.
It may be of interest to the read
er to compare the results of this 
survey with that of Dr. Galluus, 
which was published in last weeks 
Pittsburgh Press. In Gallups over
all public opinion survey the ma
jority opposed the Generals re
moval.

Carnegie Cops Two Awards 
At Detroit ME Convention
Fuel Injection Paper Wins Cash Prize;
Edema Takes Region 5 Man-Mile Trophy99
Carnegie Tech made a clean sweep of Detroit Convention of the 
American Society of Mechanical Engineers by taking the two top 
awards offered.
Last week over four hundred students and professors from lead
ing engineering colleges in north 
east United States and southern 
Canada met in Detroit for the an
nual Region V convention. They 
competed for two major awards
(1) cash prize for the best tech
nical paper delivered by a student;
(2) the Region V Man-Mile Tro
phy for the most active student 
chapter of ASME. For the first 
time in history a -single school
CITtook first honors in both 
categories.
Study Fuel Injection 
Archie Newton won 50 dol
lars by outclassing last years win
ner, Toronto University, with an 
outstanding speech on Fuel In
jection for Gasoline Engines."
Newton, with Ralph Snyder and 
several other senior mechanicals, 
has done extensive orginial re
search on this subject in addition 
to working closely with Gulf Re
search Laboratories. His test work 
has been done in the senior me
chanical engineering lab under the 
supervision of Mr. J. F. Osterle.
Carnegie Most Active 
Marius Edema, chairman of Car
negie ASME , was awarded the 
coveted Region V Man-Mile Tro
phy at ceremonies following the 
Convention banquet. Carnegie had 
more than thirty men at the three 
day convention and displaced Uni
versity of Detroit as the most ac

ELAN Offers 
Scholarships To 
Canadian Camp
ELAN, an international organ
ization which sponsors Education 
for Living Among Nations, is of
fering a number of scholarships to 
their summer camp at Shawnigan 
Lake in British Columbia. The 
scholarships, available to students, 
teachers, artists, and workers, will 
cover approximately half the cost 
of a summer at the camp.
In exchange for the scholarship, 
the recipient contributes his par
ticular abilities and interests to 
the group life at the camp. Some 
operational duties are also requir
ed such as food preparation, gar
dening, library service, and gen
eral maintenance.
Scholarships are awarded on the 
basis of the applicants attitudes 
and skills rather than age or aca
demic experience, but good health 
and a basic knowledge of French 
are necessities. Participation for 
less than the entire 8^ weeks for 
the session is seldom acceptable.
ELAN also sponsors travel 
abroad and related activities for 
interested students and teachers. 
Literature explaining the activities 
of this group and the available 
scholarships can be obtained by 
writing to: Miss Dorothy Punderson, president: 947 Portland ave

been taken as yet, the Board is seriously considering several of the 
proposed changes.* * * *
In all of the nations colleges intramural athletics have come to
play an important role in the life of the campus. At Carnegie and
other professional type schools they have become so prominent that
they now dominate varsity athletics. Their growth and development
have solved many problems for4------------------------------------------------------
modern day educators.
Here at Carnegie the program 
has made large and rapid strides 
in the last few years. The current 
arrangements have the quantity 
and quality to rank among the 
best in the nation. There are, how
ever, certain weaknesses in the 
plan as it stands today. It is the 
purpose of this paper to bring out 
some of these and to propose 
methods of arriving at solutions.
Public Relations Important 
One of the major problems con
fronting the intramural depart
ment is the establishment of good 
public relations. All too few of 
the students are familiar with the 
activities of the department and its 
branches, such as the Intramural 
Board and Managers Club. It is
largely lack of information or perj en override a decisionhaps misinformation which has j . ,, .J* ,, .... of the Board by a vote of two-led to the disputes and criticisms J, ,, thiras or some other suitable marfollowing suggestions are made to 
the Intramural Board:
1. To arrange schedules so that 
little or no overlap occurs. This 
fault is particularly noticeable in 
the Spring when soccer and soft
ball on occasion push the latter in
to final examination week.
2. To consider arranging the 
schedule so that the touch football 
championship may be played on 
the Friday afternoon of Home
coming.
3. To establish a new proced
ure for handling protests. A more 
affirmative approach seems desira
ble if the dignity of the organiza
tion is to be maintained.
4. To revitalize the Managers 
Club. In this connection it is sug
gested that the Managers be givOn Your Mark99 
Latest Playhouse 
Musical Revue
The latest edition of the Pitts
burgh Playhouse annual musical 
revue, On Your Mark, is an in
timate topical revue featuring the 
music of George Bauer, the lyrics 
of John Rox, Leonard Gershe, Al
bert G. Miller, and Robert 
Schleihauf. The sketches are the 
work of David Crantz and William 
Putch.
Frank Wagner is staging the 
musical numbers and choreogra
phy; Fred Burleigh is handling 
sketch direction, and Bauer is do
ing the musical direction, assisted 
by Margaret Jones. A cast of fif
teen young singers, dancers and 
actors will bring the original 
songs, dances and sketches to 
Pittsburgh Playhouse-goers.
On Your Mark will run from 
May 5 through June 9.
of the different divisions of the 
department. The publishing of the 
Intramural Handbook did much to 
alleviate this condition. It appears, 
however, that further education of
the student body is desirable. , membeto act as an orean It is suggested that the Board ; J 
establish another officer, the pubgin in their own organization. This 
would require a closer check on 
the voting eligibility of the Man
agers Club than is now enforced.
5. To attempt to secure a faclic relations officer, to be incor
porated in the executive commit
tee. His general assignment will 
be to publicize the intramural pro
gram and its activities in such a 
way that interest in the program 
on the part of all students shall 
be increased.
Suggested Duties
Some or all of the following du
ties might be delegated to this of
ficer or his assistants:
1. To act as a liaison between 
the sports editor of the TARTAN 
and the intramural department. In 
such a capacity all releases from 
the department, i.e., announce
ments of championship games, re
sults, records, etc., would be clear
ed through him. The latter point 
avoids duplication and insures cor
rect information.
2. To require publication of 
dates upon which entries are due 
in the TARTAN at least one week 
prior to the closing date. This fol
lows .closely Student Councils 
regulation regarding announce
ments of elections.
3. To publish a mimeographed j 
newsletter regarding the activities 
or proposed activities of the de
partment.
4. To arrange to display early 
in the year in some prominent spot 
the trophies which will be award
ed by the Board.
5. To employ a statistician, at 
nominal pay, to keep individual 
and team records.
6. To insure that the actions of 
the Board and Managers Club 
receive proper publicity.
7. To arrange special publicity 
activities such as a Senior-Faculty 
softball game.
8. To organize Intramural 
Night in conjunction with the 
Managers Club. In addition, an 
open house for the physical edu
cation department, i.e., the gym, 
pool, and offices, on ths same night 
might be put to advantage publicity-wise.
9. To investigate the advisabil
ity of petitioning Sigma Delta Psi, 
national athletic honorary, to es
tablish a chapter on the campus. 
This honorary requires successful 
completion of fifteen tests of phys
ical skill for membership.
10. To be prepared to release 
a statement from the president of 
the Board on any controversial isJ 
sue which may arise. In certain in
stances the release of such a state
ment should be made to the TAR' 
TAN even without a request.
Suggestions to Board #
In addition to tKe^ establishment 
of a public relaiiofns thcer, the
Member of the Associated College
izer for independent individuals, 
i.e., those students unaffiliated 
with any group whatsoever. These 
people would file their names with 
the faculty member. He would 
initially organize the team after 
which they would become separat
ed from him.
Expect Manpower Problem
Another serious problem which 
may confront the problem in the 
near future is the one of manpow
er. The expected decrease in male 
enrollment will undoubtedly alter 
some plans. Should the situation 
become even more acute than is 
anticipated, some plan should be 
ready.
The following suggestions are 
made with the idea that they may 
help to formulate such a plan.
1. Establish a co-educational 
program. The support of the Wom
en Athletic Association is probably i
not sufficient to make such a plan 
succeed. If the support of the so
rorities, Citcom, and the dormitor
ies could be solicited, a strong bid 
for such action could most assur
edly be made.
2. Consolidate the present pro
gram. This might involve elimina
tion of the less popular sports and 
a tendency towards sports which 
require teams small in number. 
Perhaps a merge of the Intramural 
Board and Managers Club might 
be required. * <
3. Merge organizations. Frater
nities might well be willing to 
unite their forces. Machinery 
whereby this could become legally 
possible should be set up if it is 
believed that mergers are in order.
4. Whatever plan is devised, it 
is well to remember that a small 
well-organized program is highly 
superior to a large loose-jointed 
one.
Details Avoided
Some of the proposals set forth 
in this paper will be found im
possible or inadvisable at this time. 
Others will be found more feasible 
if they are compromised. The de
tails have been purposely avoided 
in all cases in the belief that they 
can best be worked out by those 
who inaugurate concrete action 
and to allow for major changes in 
plan.
It is well to remember, however, 
that any action taken, no matter 
how trivial, will yield far more 
satisfying results if it can be ef
ficiently brought to the attention 
of those it concerns.

High School Teachers 
Get CIT Fellowships
Between 20 and 40 fellowshipseach valued at $250will be 
awarded to secondary school science teachers who will participate 
in a special six weeks summer program at Carnegie Tech.
Announcement of the program was made by Dr. J. C. Warner 
and A. C. Monteith, vice presidents------------------------------------------------------
of the Westinghouse Electric Cor 
poration and chairman of the 
Westinghouse Educational Founda
tion. The fellowships have been 
made available by the Foundation, 
which is maintained by the West
inghouse Electric Cohporation.
Stress Fundamentals
Dr. Warner said that the pro
gram of study will stress the im
portance of fundamental concepts 
in chemistry, physics and mathe
matics, and will provide a survey 
of recent developments in the pure 
and applied sciences.
Throughout the program, em
phasis will be placed on teaching 
methods, in which the Carnegie 
Plan of Professional Education will 
be featured, Dr. Warner said. 
The academic program will con
sist of lectures on such topics as 
radio-activity, nuclear research, 
synthetic rubber, petroleum, and 
applied mathematics.
This program will be supple
mented by visits to Carnegie Techs
research and teaching laboratories, 
and to some of the many great in
dustrial establishments of the 
Pittsburgh area.
The university president added 
that the program will provide six 
hours of credit for teachers who 
are seeking credits for an advanced degree. Full-time staff memv 
bers of the college of Engineering 
and Science will have charge of 
the course.
Unsung Teachers 
Explaining his firms interest in 
the Fellowships, Mr. Monteith 
pointed out that much of the credit 
for Americas supply of top-flight 
engineers and scientists can be 
given to the nations unsung sec
ondary school science teachers.

It seems like ages ago since we 
last dubbed in a News and 
Views column, but just to prove 
that we are still capable of gossip 
we will insert a few choice items 
concerning evening students.
Seen at the recent engineering 
banquet were evening school grad
uates Mike Gittens, John Miller, 
John Betza, and Karl Schartz. All 
had a grand time.
Betty Zelinski, Council Secre
tary, is sporting a new sparkler 
on the proper finger. Betty is one 
of Councils faithful workers, and 
we wish her much happiness.
Bob Ellstrom, genial social 
chairman of Council, has moved 
into his new home in the Fox 
Chapel district. Bob is soon to be 
a proud papa.
Congratulations should be in or
der to George Schussler for the 
fine manner in which he handled 
Council duties at the Engineers 
Banquet. George is gaining much 
experience from his duties as 
Evening Student Council presi
dent.
Incidentally we met Patricia

Word Of Thanks
The success of the 36th Annual Evening School Engin
eering Banquet was due in great measure to the streuous 
efforts of the two Co-Chairmen, Messrs. Byron May and 
Bill Bartolli. Yet we must recognize that the gentlemen had 
the help of many members of the evening school body, plus 
the good will and drive furnished by Evening Student Coun
cil.
The girls of Phi Gamma Pi were responsible for most 
of the stenographic work connected with the affair. Will 
Schnarrenberger handled ticket sales and records with his 
usual efficiency, and was aided at the door by George Dawes. 
Tony Miscimarra, Dick Gomrick, Floyd Byers, George Dawes, 
Chuck Keller, and Paul Brannen helped pack the souvenir 
bags the afternoon of the banquet. Kathy Galligan printed 
the programs, and a mighty fine job she did.
Evening Council 
Elects Byron May 
New President
At its monthly meeting held 
Sunday, May 6, President Schuss
ler presiding, Evening Student 
Council climaxed its school year 
with the election of the following 
officers: president, Byron May;
vice-president, Charles Keller; 
secretary, Kathy Galligan, and 
treasurer, Will Schnarrenberger.
Council approved a picnic co
sponsored picnic by Phi Gamma 
Pi, and Sigma Delta Phi to be 
held June 23, at North Park.
Treasurer Schnarrenberger gave 
a favorable report concerning the 
outcome of the Engineering Ban
quet.
Miss Martha Latza was ap
pointed Hand Book editor with 
LeRoy Rowland as her issistant.
Bill Bartolli was appointed So
cial Chairman by the new presi
dent. All of the new officers are 
to take office at the beginning of 
the 1951-52 school year.

Machine is Symbol
It is easy to see why such a 
society should identify itself with 
so material and time contained a 
symbol as the machine, for the 
interplay between the dynamic 
and restricting elements within a 
machine ideally describe the kind 
of society which America pos
sesses.
The machine employs force dy
namically but limits the direction 
in which the force can be applied. 
If ever there was a land where 
initiative was left free to develop 
dynamically it is America, and 
yet, the same land limits by law 
and custom the direction of the 
development.
Artist is Isolated
Needless to say, those whose 
ideas and efforts are not easily 
related to this particular orienta
tion experience an enforced de
tachment from the rest of society. 
From his isolated and rejected 
chamber in this mechanical struc
ture, the artist has become acutely 
aware of his own more meaning
ful value. And out of the limita
tions of his present environment, 
he envisions the America whose 
dynamic qualities will fulfill the 
promises given of a great future.
