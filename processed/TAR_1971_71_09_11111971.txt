Stever Urges Immediate 
Budget CutbacksBoard Of Trustees' Minutes
Reacting to what he terms the 
Universitys pressing financial 
problems, President Stever has 
requested that all CMU budget ad
ministrators act immediately to 
cut the current years Educational 
and General Operating expenses.
In an effort to reduce the esti
mated $1,070,000 deficit for this 
year, he has asked budget admini
strators to take the following 
steps:
 All non-personnel expense 
items in the Educational and Gen
eral Operating Budget for 1971-72 
are to be cut by a minimum of two 
and one half percent. Any budget 
administrator who feels that this 
cannot be done must receive a 
written approval from the Vice 
President for Academic Affairs or 
the Treasurer for maintaining ex
penditures at the 1971-72 bud
geted level.
 No new positions may be 
created in any part of the Univer
sity for either 1971-72 or 1972-73 
without the approval of the Presi
dent or Vice President for Aca
demic Affairs.
 Present positions in any part of 
the University which become va
cant may not be filled without the 
approval of the President or Vice 
President for Academic Affairs.

University funds and from outside
Election to 28 available Stu
dent Senate seats was held this 
week, with 86% of the candidates 
winning.
Over 30% of the people elected 
didnt especially want a seat on 
Student Senate, but were awarded 
one anyway as a result of write-in 
voting.
Of the 21 candidates, 3 lost, 
including the infamous Mr. Myron 
Staroschak, who ran on the one 
turd in the toilet bowl of reality 
platform.
Roughly 450 students voted in 
the election. Full term seats go to 
the greatest vote-getter in each 
constituency. The names of the 
winners, listed according to the 
number of votes received, follows:
COMMUTERS: Joan Kodish; 
Leslie Bram; Thomas KJopack; 
lames Naughton; Robert Luckie 
ind Dennis Brandi; Mark Green.
sponsors are to be carefully moni
tored and analyzed to see to what 
extent outside research funds can 
be used to alleviate Educational 
and General Operating Budget 
pressures. Commitments to out
side sponsors must, of course, be 
carried out.
 All existing cost-sharing agree
ments are to be studied carefully 
to determine if a portion of CMU 
cost-sharing can be borne by the 
existing Educational and General 
Operating Budget rather than ab
sorbing such cost-sharing against 
overhead recovery. All new re
search proposals are to be analyzed 
to determine that, to the extent 
possible, cost-sharing shall be ab
sorbed in the existing E&CO bud
get rather than plan for its absorp
tion against overhead recovery.
 Any plan to contract for con
sulting or other special services 
from an off-campus agency is to be 
brought to the President or the 
Vice President for Academic Af
fairs for review and decision.
During budget year 1970-71, 
the University incurred a one mil
lion dollar operating deficit. For 
this reason, the Administration 
and Trustees are especially con
cerned about increasing the budget 
deficit by another million dollars.

The Board of Trustees has di
rected that the proceedings of 
Board meetings be published for 
the information of the CarnegieMellon University community. 
The following are the proceedings 
of the meeting held on October 18, 
1971.
Report on Program in Engineering 
and Public Affairs
Professor R. W. Dunlap des
cribed from the perspective of an 
engineer the new program in Engi
neering and Public Affairs, a joint 
program by Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, the School of Urban 
and Public Affairs, and the Gradu
ate School of Industrial Adminis
tration leading to the bachelors 
degree. The Sloan Foundation has 
made a four-year grant of 
$442,000 to support it. Beginning 
in the late 1930s, a revolution oc
curred in engineering education 
with the introduction of humani
ties and social sciences as about 
one-fourth of the work in the 
bachlors program. Another revo
lution occurred in the late 1950s 
and early 1960s with the emphasis 
on engineering science, instead of 
engineering practice. Now in Engi
neering and Public Affairs we are 
beginning a new revolution that is 
reemphasizing the application of 
engineering and problem-solving. 
It involves both the engineering 
and social aspects. Examples may 
be seen in our Transportation Re
search Institute, Environmental 
Research Institute, and Process 
Research Institute.
Professor G. H. Lewis com
mented on the program from the 
perspective of a social scientist. 
Carnegie-Mellon University is 
unique in the nature of our social 
science program. In GSIA, SUPA, 
and H&SS, the faculty have a 
major background in analytical 
and statistical training, and they 
are productive in relevant research. 
Such a faculty together with those 
in engineering means that Carne
gie-Mellon University has special 
potential for developing this in
novative and urgently needed new 
program.
Organization of Libraries and 
Appointment of Director
There are four libraries in the 
University: The Hunt Library, The 
Hunt Botanical Library in The
Hunt Institute for Botanical Docu
mentation, the library in Science 
Hall that houses most of the engi
neering and science collection, and 
the library in the Mellon Institute 
Building. Professor Kenneth H. 
Fagerhaugh was appointed as Di
rector of University Libraries. He 
is responsible for the administra
tion of these four library units.
Report of the Budget Committee 
and Annual Financial Report for 
the Year Ending June 30,1971
Mr. Fisher presented in some 
detail an analysis of the financial 
results of the year 1970-71 and 
commented on the Annual Finan
cial Report. The gist of his presen
tation:
The year ended with a deficit of 
^1,409,000. In addition, we 
deemed it prudent to write off our 
investment in Penn Central Trans
portation Company commercial 
paper in the amount of $954,000, 
although legal action has been 
taken against the broker. Expendi
tures for on-going operations were 
close to the budget, but new activi
ties added expenses. Interest on 
the construction advance for 
Science Hall was $219,000. Ex
penses for maintaining Science 
Hall were $75,000, and $315,000 
represents alterations and im
provements of facilities formerly 
charged against plant funds. The 
deficit problem was for the most 
part due to a drop in income. Com
pared to the year before, tuition 
income was $400,000 less, income 
from short-term investments was 
$268,000 less, and overhead re
covered on sponsored research was 
$156,000 less.
Endowment income utilized to 
support annual operations was up 
$965,000.
As of the end of the year, there 
were 251 fewer full-time faculty 
and staff members, a reduction of 
11.1% as economy measures were 
taken.
For the current year 1971-72, a 
drop in enrollment will mean a re
duction of about $688,000 in bud
geted tuition income.
To cope with this problem, 
steps are being taken to maximize 
income and reduce expenses.
The CMU Fund and Progress 
Report on the Fund for 
Distinction
Gifts and pledges to the Fund 
for Distinction now amount to 
$35.4 million, and major proposals 
totaling $6 million have been 
made. To seek to increase annual 
giving for support of the operating 
budget to $750,000 a year within 
three to five years, the CMU Fund 
has been established. Annual gifts 
are being solicited from alumni, 
trustees, parents, and friends of 
the University. The trustees for
mally recorded their commitment 
to give support to this piogram.
Buildings and Grounds 
Committee
(a) Properties on Craig Street 
authorized for sale have not yet 
been sold, but discussions are to be 
held with representatives of area 
institutions to explore their pos
sible interest, (b) As authorized by 
the Executive Committee, final 
plans and specifications for Phase I 
of the Drama Complex are being 
developed, but final decision to 
build awaits full funding, (c) We 
are investigating the possibility of 
having the Hornbostel-design 
campus buildings registered as his
toric landmarks, hoping thus to 
obtain financial assistance from 
the government to restore them, 
(d) The Administration will pre
pare a minimum mandatory bud
get for building renovation and 
maintenance to be reviewed by the 
Buildings and Grounds Commit
tee.
Educational Affairs 
Committee
In the absence of Mr. Charpie, 
Dr. Schatz reported that this Com
mittee has noted the action taken 
by the Engineers Council for Pro
fessional Development accredi
ting all our engineering programs 
and had considered the reports of 
visiting committees in 1970-71, 
copies of which had been sent to 
all Trustees. It also considered and 
discussed a separate report by the 
Visiting Committee for Architec
ture. (Copies were distributed to 
the Board at this point.)
Mr. Dahlen Ritchey, a member 
of the Visiting Committee for 
Architecture, commented on the 
highlights of the report, empha
sizing the urgent need to rebuild 
the Department of Architect by 
providing more space, better sala
ries to attract faculty, and a

Letters
Editor, the TARTAN:
It has recently come to my at
tention, through the experiences 
of a good friend and recent gradu
ate of CMU, that certain professors 
hire student help for certain of 
their ongoing projects under verbal 
contracts. In this particular case, 
my friend accepted such employ
ment with a professor last spring 
for which he was promised a parti
cular sum for work performed. He 
has been paid for exactly half of 
the work he performed; the profes
sor has refused to pay him for the 
other half of the work performed
(over $100).
This professor has since 
acquired a reputation for reneging 
on verbal contracts.
The point of this letter is to 
warn students against accepting 
work with the school under a 
verbal contract. Such contracts are 
rarely worth more than the paper 
they are riot written on. Further, 
the school ordinarily does not hire 
anyone except on the basis of a 
written contract; offers of work 
with a professor under verbal con
tract should be viewed very suspi
ciously, unless the professor has a 
solid reputation for keeping his
promises.
Frequently the only recourse 
for students with a complaint of an 
unfulfilled verbal contract with a 
professor is to write a complaint to 
the professors department head, 
the college dean, and the dean of 
students. While such complaints 
may not cause fulfillment of the 
contract the complaints are kept 
on file and have bearing on the 
decision of renewal of that pro
fessors contract.
Yours truly,

Current Grading Practices: 
A Summary And Review
The following article is a sum
mary and review of the evidence 
and opinions published recently 
concerning grading practices. It 
was written by Jonathan R. War
ren, a research psychologist at the 
Educational Testing Service in 
Berkeley, and should provide some 
valuable information for those in 
H&SS, as well as CIT, who are con
cerned with their grading system.
Grades are considered neces
sary to prod students to study, to 
guide their learning, to reward 
those who have done well, to keep 
a check on academic standards, 
and to sort students for later se
lection to graduate schools and 
obs. Grades are also considered a 
deterrent to effective learning, a 
cause of cunical game-playing in 
place of productive study, and an 
inducement to docile plodding 
rather than imaginative indepen
dent thinking. They are said to 
make adversaries of faculty and 
students instead of collaborators 
in learning and to contribute to a 
stifling academic rigidity. The ex
tent and intensity of views for and 
against grades probably account 
for the large number of experi
mental modifications of grading 
systems now going on, for the 
|imited nature of most of them, 
and for the great apprehension 
hat has accompanied the intro
duction of new approaches.
About half the colleges and uni
versities in the country have intro
duced some modification into 
heir grading system in the past
ive years. Students and faculty 
lembers have pushed hard for the 
change and have spend countless 
committee hours in deliberation. 
The most common consequence 
has been the introduction of a 
pass-fail option that permits stu
dents to take one course per term 
on a pass-fail basis if the course is 
not in the students major field. 
Students who choose to use the 
optiontypically about half the 
student bodycomplete their col
lege careers with about 10 percent 
of their courses graded pass-fail. 
Yet graduate schools, individually 
and in associations, have expressed 
alarm over the threat to their 
selection processes if the pass-fail 
method is permitted to spread.
Present concerns over grading
tend to have two unexpected char
acteristics. First they arise from a 
large body of firmly held opinion 
and little objective evidence. Se
cond, relatively unimportant is
sues are given great attention while 
far more fundamental ones are al
most ignored.
The first characteristic is clear 
from the volume of literature on 
grades that consists mainly of sum
maries of opinion and broad infer
ences from questionable observa
tions. That students taking one 
pass-fail course give more atten
tion to their other courses, for ex
ample, leads to the inference that 
multilevel grading is necessary to 
make students work. Observations 
of how students actually spend 
their time or of what they accom
plish under different forms of gra
ding have been rare.
The neglect of fundamental is
sues while lesser ones are pursued 
in evident in the band-wagon 
spread of pass-fail grading. Its ef
fect is to remove the distinctions 
between several levels of accepta
ble performance while adding no
thing to a grading system widely 
acknowledged to be inadequate. 
Tinkering with the machinery of 
grading leaves the more fundamen
tal assumptions underlying its pur
poses unexamined. Grades are in
tended, for example, to be useful 
descriptions of student accom
plishment. But is the certification 
of accomplishment an appropriate 
function for teaching institutions? 
This question has received less at
tention than whether performance 
should be rated on two or five 
levels.
Some other important issues 
that have been lost in the concern 
with the external form of grades 
are: How well do grades, of what
ever form, serve the purposes ofr 
which they are intended? Do those 
purposes merit the enormous ex
penditures of time and energy in
volved in grading? Are alternative 
ways of accomplishing the same 
purposes available? What are the 
unintended consequences of gra
ding practices for students, for in
dividual colleges, and for society at 
large? What do grades represent?
NEW FORMS OF GRADING
One of the frequent arguments
against reducing the number of 
grade categories is that the evalua
tion of student progress would be 
hampered. There is little to sup
port this view. Student perfor
mance can be evaluated and its re
sults communicated to students 
with no reference whatever to 
grades. Evaluation occurs through 
a variety of processesreading pa
pers, giving quizzes, lab exercises, 
and exams; asking questions; 
listening to discussions; observing 
the quality of student questions. It 
is through these processes that fa
culty members arrive at judgments 
about student accomplishment. 
Grades are the symbols that for
mally indicate a students general 
level of academic performance af
ter it has been evaluated. They can 
take a variety of forms, but their 
effect on evaluation is small.
PASS-FAIL GRADING
The pass-fail option, limited to 
one course per student per term, is 
the most common departure from 
the traditional five level A through 
F form of grading. It was adopted 
primarily to encourage students to 
take courses they would otherwise 
not risk for fear of jeopardizing 
their grade-level average. This 
purpose has not been realizes to 
any great extent, for researcn indi
cates that three-fourths or more of 
the students who use the pass-fail 
option would have taken the 
course anyway.
The major effect of the pass-fail 
option is to give students greater 
discretion in allocating their study 
time and effort among various 
courses. They frequently slight the 
pass-fail course to give more time 
to their other courses. An increase 
in grades in other courses-a result 
that might be expected-has not 
been observed. This strengthens 
the view of some faculty members 
that pass-fail grading is an invita
tion to indolence. Yet uneven al
location of effort to different 
courses seems desirable. Students 
differ in their reasons for taking 
certain courses, and courses differ 
in their importance and interest 
for different students. As might be 
expected, students overwhelm
ingly, though not unanimously, fa
vor the pass-fail option and gener
ally urge its expansion to permit

more students to exercise it in 
more courses.
The major objection to pass-fail 
grading is not that it encourages 
student indolence, but that it pre
sents problems in determining ad
mission to graduate school. Yet 
that objection is serious when a 
substantial part of a students re
cord consists of pass-fail grades, 
something that occurs in only a 
few colleges. The experiences of 
graduate of the University of Calif
ornia at Santa Cruz, where virtu
ally all grades are pass-fail, show 
graduate school admission to have 
been affected to some extent, 
though probably not substantially. 
Most of the graduates who applied 
to graduate school did get 
admitted, although not always to 
their first-choice school. The pos
sible loss of fellowships as a result 
of presenting transcripts having no 
grades other than passes may be a 
more serious consequence of passfail grading than failure to get ad
mitted to graduate school.
PASS-NO RECORD: 
NONPUNITIVE GRADING
A complication in pass-fail gra
ding is the tendency on the part of 
some faculty members to raise the 
proportion of failing grades. Some 
grades that would be Ds under the 
five-letter system become Fs un
der pass-fail. For students doing 
marginal work in a course this may 
refute one of the purposes of passfail gradingreduction of anxiety 
over grades. A grading modifica
tion directed more explicitly at re
moving the fear of failure and the 
punitive consequences of failure is 
the passno record system, un
der which a failed course is re
moved from the students record. 
Acceptable performance may be 
graded simply pass or A, B, or C. 
Several institutions have either 
started or are considering such a 
system. Experiences in junior col
leges indicate that students graded 
this way do not stretch out 
inordinately the time spent 
accumulating enough credits to 
graduate.
A common consequence of 
failure in the traditional grading 
system is that a students 
cumulative grade-point average 
may fall below the point required
for graduation or for retention in 
the college. Failed courses require 
better-than-acceptable perfor
mance in other courses if a student 
is to graduate. Making the hurdles 
higher as performance gets lower 
seems unreasonable and punitive. 
Pass-no record grading avoids that 
situation.
DESCRIPTIVE GRADING
In descriptive grading, the in
structors evaluation of a student is 
reported as written comments or 
phrases that describe performance 
in whatever terms the instructor 
thinks most appropriate. Descrip
tions of the nature of the performance lead in turn to judgments of 
excellent, good or poor and are the 
major strength of descriptive gra
ding as well as the major distinc
tion from symbolic grading.
Drawbacks to the descriptive 
grading are the time required to 
write the descriptive comments, 
and the difficulty selections com
mittees face in making quick and 
simple comparisons of prose de
scriptions of performance, and the 
administrative awkwardness if non 
standard reports. Forming a judg
ment about which letter grade to 
assign a student is often easier and 
less time consuming than writing a 
descriptive comment about a stu
dents performance. Comparing 
the capabilities of two students is 
also easier if each is described by a 
numerical grade-point average. But 
while the process of comparing is 
simpler with grade-point averages, 
the information on which the com
parisons are based is probably far 
greater with descriptive com
ments. Even Terse, barren com
ments such as good student are 
at least as informative as B.
The administrative problems in
troduced by descriptive grading 
could be substantially reduced 
with further advances in the com
puterized handling of prose. From 
cumulative stored descriptions of 
student performance, a computer 
could select relevant aspects of 
performance and merge them into 
a standardized summary that 
would suit whatever purpose was 
intended. Selection criteria for 
honors at graduation, for a fellow

In Carnegie Music Hall
The following are excerpts 
from the final report of the Com
mission on the Status and Needs of 
Women at CMU. The report which 
was issued last week cites discrimi
natory practices in several major 
areas of university operations. 
Copies of the summary of the 
report are available in the Publi
cations Office, Baker Hall:
.. . where programs have more 
than 50 percent women, they tend 
to be discontinued (Social Work, 
Library Science, MMCC); where 
programs have more than 50 per
cent women applicants, discrimi
natory admissions policies tend to 
develop (H&SS, CFA); where pro
grams have less than ten percent 
women applicants, no efforts are 
made to attract more women stu
dents (CIT, MIS). The Commission 
concludes that a bias against 
women students exists in CMUs 
overall educational practice . ..
Housing:
The Commission investigated 
housing costs and dormitory regu
lations. It discovered that women 
in Morewood Gardens pay an 
average of $120 more per year 
than men in the Hill dormitories; 
the increased cost is attributable to 
the presence in Morewood Gar
dens of a paid residence staff, night 
security guards and a heating sys
tem which necessitates salaries for 
five maintenance engineers. The 
Commission recommends that a 
referendum of women students be 
conducted to insure that women 
are aware of the extra costs and are 
willing to pay them.
Although dormitory regula
tions have been rapidly disap
pearing during the past five years, 
women students continue to allege 
that regulations prohibiting men in 
the womens dormitories are more 
likely to be enforced than rules 
prohibiting women in mens 
dormitories; the matter may be 
one of rumor rather than fact, but 
it should be clarified ...
Classroom Bias:
The Commission solicited anec
dotal evidence of classroom dis
crimination against women 
through individual and group in
terviews held with graduate and 
undergraduate women. Such bias, 
when it was reported, usually took 
the form of comments reflecting a 
professors low opinion of 
womens ability (especially their 
mathematical ability), or his belief 
that women are not serious stu
dents. Noting that such comments 
may well become self-fulfilling 
prophecies, the Commission 
recommends the development of 
programs to promote an awareness 
among CMU faculty and staff that 
stereotyped ideas of appropriate 
roles for women can be education
ally detrimental to students, many 
of whom are struggling to evaluate 
their own potentialities and are 
influenced by their professors 
opinions.
Women Employees, Faculty:
... Women are underrepre
sented on the faculty whether one 
uses as a base level their repre
sentation in the University work 
force, the percentage of women 
faculty in higher education nation
ally (22 percent) or fhe percentage 
holding Ph.D. degrees throughout 
the country. Compared to men, 
CMU faculty women are underrep
resented on non-Senate commit
tees, are paid less, are more likely 
to have short-term contracts, are 
less likely to be tenured and if 
tenured are less likely to be full 
professors, are more likely to leave 
the University, have lower levels of 
fringe benefits and are less likely to 
apply for and to receive University 
supported leaves . ..
Salaries:
Men have higher average salaries 
than women faculty members in 
nine of the 11 possible compari
sons between men and women in 
the same departments with the 
same rank. The range of differ
ences is from $144 (for the one 
comparison where womens 
average salary exceeds mens) to 
$5,750 in favor of men ...
Contracts, Tenure 
and Terminations:
. .. Contracts for women tend 
to be shorter than for men. Thus, 
28 percent of the 17 women assis
tant professors have one or two 
year contracts, compared to 5 per
cent of men with such contracts in 
the same ranks.
Although women are 10 per
cent of the full time faculty, they 
are only seven percent of the ten
ured faculty. There is a suggestion 
of a trend for tenured women to 
hold the rank of associate profes
sor (12 associate professors out of
16 tenured women) rather than 
full professor. The data suggest the 
possibility that tenure may be 
given as a substitute for promotion 
to women ...
Salaries (Women Employees,
Staff and Administration):
... Women are paid less than 
men in each of the 11 job cate
gories in which comparisons were 
possible. There were other cate
gories in which comparisons were 
impossible because no women held 
positions in these categories: exec
utives and officials, senior fellows, 
skilled craftsmen and laborers. The 
amount of salary inequity is appal
ling. For example, women depart
ment heads earn about half as 
much as men in that category, 
women in general management 
positions earn about $5,000 less 
than men, and women nonacademic professionals earn about 
$3,000 less than men ... 
CONCLUSION:
Through six months of investi
gations, data analyses, discussions, 
thought and study, the Commis
sioners have come to perceive 
CMU as a place where women do 
not enjoy full equality with men. 
Documentation of this conclusion 
fills most of this report. We have 
also come to realize, however, that 
the inequities which exist result 
not from evil intention and deli
berate injustice but rather from 
oversight, from a failure to 
examine our traditions in light of 
our values and to a large extent 
from a general fogginess about 
what sex discrimination is ...

lectual qualities, for admission to a 
particular graduate department or 
for eligibility for athletic participa
tion can all be expected to vary. 
Computer generated summaries of 
prose descriptions could be tai
lored to these and other purposes.
MULTIDIMENSIONAL
GRADING
Course grades and grade-point 
averages are, on the whole, quite 
reliable. The charge of unreliabi
lity often made against grades may 
be valid when applied to grades 
assigned a particular paper or ex
amination, but end-of-term grades 
show a high degree of consistency 
across instructors, subject matter, 
and time. Thus grades appear to 
reflect a composite of many quali
ties. Determining these qualities 
and how they are combined at dif
ferent institutions, in different 
fields of study, by different profes
sors could lead to a substantial im
provement in grading.
A multidimensional grading 
procedure has been proposed that 
would permit the kinds of perfor
mance incorporated into grades to
be specified, while avoiding the ex
cessive time and the lack of stan
dardization involved in descriptive 
grading. The procedure starts with 
specifying, at a particular institu
tion, the attributes considered im
portant in student performance in 
any department. Requests to fa
culty members to suggest the stu
dent attributes each considers im
portant are likely to produce a to
tal of 100 or more. These should 
be reducible, through the combin
ation of similar attributes, to a 
more manageable grouping of 20 
or so. Rating forms for these dim
ensions of performance could then 
be distributed to the faculty. Each 
faculty member would select the 
dimensions he considers appropri
ate in describing a particular stu
dents performance. In some situa
tion, students may be permitted to 
select the dimensions on which 
they are to be judged. In either 
case, the evaluation or judgment 
would, as at present, be entirely up 
to the individual faculty member.
Averaging would occur only 
with respect to a common dimen
sion. Good performance resulting 
from doggedness would be distin
guished from performance at a 
comparable level reached by in
tellectual acuity. Professors who 
prefer to make their own overall 
judgment of student performance 
could be provided one scale on 
which to do so. Those reluctant to 
treat widely varying kinds of per
formance on a single scale of merit 
would be freed from doing so. Dif
ferent purposes of grades could be 
served appropriately by different 
kinds of judgments. Students 
would be described with respect to 
a variety of forms of academic per
formance.
GRADING PRACTICES 
AND PURPOSE
Those who advocate changing 
the system of grades seem to be 
largely concerned about what they 
perceive as undesirable side ef
fects, such as the constraints 
grades are said to impose on 
learning. Proponents of current 
grading procedures respond by 
pointing out that the suggested 
modification would jeopardize 
some purpose grades serve, such as 
getting students admitted to gra
duate school or informing students 
of their level of performance. But 
the purposes themselves, some
times asserted and sometimes only 
implied, are rarely examined 
closely. The purposes most often 
attributed to grades, either expli
citly, are to motivate students, to 
provide students with information 
about their progress, and to pro
vide a basis for selection to more 
advanced educational programs.
MOTIVATING STUDENTS
Students and faculty alike as
sert that grades are important be
cause they induce students to en
gage in academic tasks they would 
otherwise avoid. Studies of op
tional pass-fail grading, student ac
counts of their own behavior, and 
observations of student behavior 
all support the view that grades do 
indeed influence student behavior. 
Less certain is whether the induced 
behavior is more desirable or less 
desirable than the behavior that 
would have occurred without 
grades.

The high*pressure champion of free enterprise revealed in Las Vegas by two young film*makers.
Im like a rolling stonegathering moss, says Murray, 
one of suburban New Yorks most successful insurance 
salesmen. With such artful self-description KING, 
MURRAY begins its modern-day Odyssey of making 
it in contemporary America. From Long Island to Las 
Vegas, we travel with Murray as he peddles insurance, 
wines and dines potential clients, ogles girls and looks 
into himself as a human being.
The form of KING, MURRAY is something new in 
movies. The makers of the film call it spontaneous 
fiction. It is, in fact, a highly successful hybrid of 
documentary realism and dramatic reconstruction. The 
subject is a real man who became rich by selling insur
ance to his friends and neighbors in suburban New 
York. Incredible as it seems, his personality and life
style is just as it appears in the film; he is the per
sonification of the high pressure, loud, obnoxious 
salesman, as Murray himself puts it. But during the 
course of following this man, he is revealed in all his 
humanity, greed and confusion.
KING, MURRAY is hilariously funny. Its humor 
stems from the recognition of the Murray-like elements 
that are in everyones experience and its value lies in 
letting us express that recognition as laughter. For the 
conflict and the message of KING, MURRAY hits at the 
heart of the alienation felt by the contemporary gen
eration when confronted by the naked capitalist ethic
King Murray 
I Am Curious (Yellow)
of materialism, acquisition of wealth and the callous, 
anti-human behavior that results.
KING, MURRAY was made by young film-makers 
and is aimed at the young audience. In a sense, Murray 
and what he represents is the Enemy. The whole world 
of Las Vegas, guilty sex and money mania is the root 
of the futureless world that the young are trying so 
desperately to change.
One astonishing side issue has been the tremendous 
international acceptance of KING, MURRAY. In Swe
den, at the Cannes Film Festival and throughout Eu
rope, what we previously had seen as an indigenous 
American phenomenon turns out to be a universal 
human experience.
David Hoffman and Amram Nowak are among Amer
icas best-known documentary film-makers. Their film, 
A DAY WITH TIMMY PAGE has become a classic in 
American schools. Their vision of Murray and his 
world prompted Garson Kanin to say, KING, MUR
RAY is an enthralling experience. Sitting before it, you 
are not so muoh seeing a film as meeting a man; not 
only meeting him but coming to know him in all his 
human fascination and complexity. I wish I had made 
it. I look forward to seeing it again and again.

appropriateness can be questioned 
and should be examined in relation 
to the purposes of the selecting 
institution and to social considera
tions beyond the academic system 
itself.
HOW WELL DO GRADES 
FUNCTION?
The effectiveness of grades in 
accomplishing their stated pur
poses is questionable; they can be 
neither damned nor praised with 
any confidence. Yet grades are 
familiar and may be comfortable 
for that reason alone. They may be 
innocuous in the sense that they 
do no more harm than good, while 
doing some of each. They help 
some students find structure and 
purpose in-their academic pursuits 
while discouraging others who 
may be better candidates for learn
ing. They provide information 
concerning general academic per
formance to external agencies that 
want a convenient global evalua
tion of students for selection pur
poses, but they dont give much 
information back to students.
Eliminating distinctions of vari
ous levels of academic success gives 
students greater discretion in their 
study activities. Eliminating the 
grade of failure gives students still 
more latitutde. Improving the ef
fectiveness with which grading ac
complishes the variety of purposes 
for which it is intended, however, 
is likely to require a substantial 
increase in the flexibility and com
plexity of grading procedures.
Multidimensional forms of grading 
offer some alternatives to present 
methods. But basic questions about purpose and function, parti
cularly as they involve the social 
consequences of grading, will re
main cloudy until they are given 
some of the attention now concen
trated on questions of form.

lows.
One conclusions that seems 
' justified and should hardly be sur
prising is that different kinds of 
students respons differently to dif
ferent pedagogical procedures. 
While some students need struc
tured direction of effort and the 
formal affirmation of accomplish
ment that a final grade gives them, 
others find the constraints of 
grades onerous. Whether a desire 
for formal certification of achieve
ment is a more important incentive 
to study than the self-satisfaction 
arising from competent perfor
mance cannot be determined from 
available evidence. The desire for 
competence, however, as assessed 
by the student himself and as re
vealed in a variety of ways by 
teachers and by other students 
seems to provide a level of motiva
tion that is not augmented appreci
ably by the assignment of formal 
grades.
GRADES ASCONVEYORS 
OF INFORMATION
Grades are often described as 
important aids to learning because 
of the information they give stu
dents about their performance. 
But grades themselves give stu
dents very little new information. 
Most students know reasonably 
closely, as a result of the variety of 
evaluative processes that occur 
both formally and informally, 
what their grade will be.
The periodic evaluation of pro
gress that guides a students learn
ing takes a wide variety of formsoccasional tests and quizzes, evalu
ation of written work, instructor 
reactions to student comments 
and questions, and many other ac
tivities that include student beha
vior and instructor response. Most 
of the time no grade is involved, 
but the informal evaluation that 
occurs gives students valuable in
formation about their perform
ance. The grade assigned at the end 
of a course conveys information 
largely to persons and agencies 
other than the student and in
structor who were parties to the 
learning.
formance depends on the similari
ty between the two programs, the 
length of time between prediction 
and performance, and peculiarities 
of the person and situation to 
which the prediction applies.
Educational selection based on 
previous grades has also been criti
cized for its constraining effect on 
the economic and social advance
ment of members of the lower seg
ments of the social class structure. 
The academic achievement that 
grades reflect is more readily at
tained by members of the middle 
and upper segments of society. 
Grade-based selection offers the 
opportunity for further educa
tional development to those al
ready most highly developed and 
increases the gap between the low
er and upper segments of the popu
lation with respect to whatever 
benefits education provides. As 
those benefits become mwe 
strongly associated with power 
and prestige, educational selection 
that depends heavily on grades 
may exacerbate already serious 
social inequities. The contention is 
not that grades are inappropriate 
selection criteria, only that their
GRADES

promising students. But two-thirds 
of the major graduate institutions 
in the country reported that merit,

test scores, was the basis for admis

earning good grades is accepted as 
the most justifiable basis for select
ing graduate students, problems 
still remain in the use of under
graduate grades for selection. They 
just dont predict graduate school 
grades very well.
Studies relating undergraduate 
grades to first-year grades in gradu

the past 20 years and in all kinds of 
programs have shown correlation

Clint Eastwood appears to be 
mellowing, for lately his movie 
roles have contained far less vio
lence and action than did his ear
lier efforts. His current feature, 
PLAY MISTY FOR ME, even 
makes Eastwood out to be a pretty 
nice guy and thats quite a long 
way from the sadistic roles which 
brought him his popularity. The 
only bad thing about this softening 
is that while the Eastwood image 
may be changing, the grade of 
motion picture in which he is ap
pearing is remaining the same. 
Since the audience is now no 
longer distracted by sadistic acts of 
violence being done by or to East
wood, they have more time to con
centrate upon the plot, and the 
glaring flaws which it contains.
All things considered, one 
would have to be pretty damn gul
lible to wholeheartedly swallow 
everything which one would have 
to in order to thoroughly enjoy

suspension of disbelief is one 
thing, and most film audiences will 
readily engage in this, or they 
wouldnt be in the theater in the

just plain ridiculousespecially 
when these incidents are being 
played straight. For example, who 
would rush off to rescue their girl
friend from a knife weilding

without first calling the police and

These events and others in the film 
go a long way toward destroying 
any suspense which the film has 
managed to generate along the 
way.
The suspense which is gener
ated in the film is done by means 
of stock scenes which have been 
thoroughly overworked by this 
time. So many of these scenes are 
used that they make the film 
highly predictable for anyone with 
the intelligence of the average 
third grader. PLAY MISTY FOR 
ME contains no real surprises for 
everything in the film happens just 
where it is supposed to. Naturally, 
this has the effect of killing a large 
amount of the suspense which the 
film should be generating.
As if having scenes which could 
stretch the credulity of an eight 
year old along with a plot that 
telegraphs all its twists a mile 
ahead isnt enough, this film takes 
things one step further by in
cluding scenes whose only func
tion seems to be to fill time, coup
ling them with scenes of great 
lyrical beauty and trying to fit 
them somehow into the plot. 
Leaving the filler aside, the beauti
ful scenes almost do more to hurt 
the film than anything else. These 
scenes are quite good in them
selves, but are about as useful in a 
thriller as an abortionist is in Vati
can City. The whole purpose of a 
thriller is to keep the audience in 
suspense. Beautiful landscapes and 
shots of a young couple in love are 
fine, but when they are overdone 
they tend to destroy the emotional 
impact of the film.
Clint Eastwood is both the star 
and the director of this picture. As 
far as his acting goes, it has not
THEBEACH BOVS
gotten any worse, nor has it really 
gotten any better either. Con
cerning his directing, the best thing 
that can be said is that while East
wood does manage to show 
promise, it is very apparent that he 
yet has a great deal to learn. It is 
easy to see that Eastwood was ex
perimenting with different tech
niques during the course of the 
film, but unfortunately his experi
ments failed. As a result of this 
PLAY MISTY FOR ME turned out 
to be a severely disjointed film 
lacking the sort of direction thril
lers need in order to be successful.
Admittedly, this film did not 
have much going for it at the out
set, but it still could have come off 
a lot better if Eastwood had been 
far more economical in his style. 
Had he chosen to replace large por
tions of the film with more mean
ingful scenes, he would have kept 
building the suspense which the 
film needs. Instead, he repeatedly 
lets the audience off the hook by 
giving them large stretches to let 
them forget the terror lurking in 
the shadows. This is not to say that 
with just a little work this film 
could have been anything really 
great-that would take an exten
sive overhaul of everything from 
the screenplay through to the 
editing. While it is no masterpiece, 
in more experienced hands the 
film could however, have turned 
out to be at least a little more 
bearable.

Board of Trustees continued from p. 
working library for architectural 
students. The Adminsitration has 
provided some additional space as 
temproary relief, has hired 5 new 
faculty at improved salaries, is get
ting new equipment for the work
shop. In other words, some moves 
are already being made in the di
rection recommended by the 
report.
The Trustees voted to endorse 
the report of the Visiting Commit
tee on Architecture designed to 
strengthen the Department, and to 
ask the Administration to present 
a plan to the Board of Trustees at 
its January meeting for the imple
mentation of the Visiting Commit
tees recommendations. Trustees 
were invited to read the report 
later and to send any comments or 
suggestions to Dr. Schatz or Presi
dent Stever.
Finance Committee
The following are the highlights 
of this report:
Inventory value of endowment 
managed by investment agents in
creased by $24,000 while market 
value decreased by $1,401,000, or 
1.25%, during the quarter ended 
September 30,1971.
Total income received during 
the past three months was 
$1,127,000. Estimated annual in
come as computed at September 
30, 1971 is $5,340,000, 5.1% of 
inventory value, a per annum in
crease of $6,000 from June 30, 
1971 projection.
In accord with authorization 
from the Finance Committee, the 
Treasurer made an investment of
c
$500,000 of endowment funds in 
The Common Fund as of Sep
tember 1, 1971. The Common 
Fund now has, as of October 1, 
1971, 135 charter member institu
tions and deposits have passed the 
$100,000,000 mark.
The Finance Committee will be 
discussing with out Investment 
Agents possible ways of increasing 
income to help to make up the 
1971-72 budgeted deficit.
Student Affairs Committee
The Committee heard a report 
from Dean Swank and Steve Fuld 
on student housing. During the 
summer all aspects of three studies 
made over the past three years 
were consolidated into a position 
stating that no additional Univer
sity housing is needed for the im
mediate future. Certain improve
ments including plumbing, electri
cal and room arrangements will be 
planned this year and undertaken 
to the limit of housing financial 
resources on an annual basis. There 
is currently sufficient housing for 
all students who wish to live on 
campus.
The Committee reviewed the 
first years experience of student 
and faculty on Trustee commit
tees. The results were favorable in 
the four committees that had such 
participation. The Chairman of the 
Board of Trustees was in atten
dance and indicated he will discuss 
participation of student and fac
ulty with the chairmen of the com
mittees that do not now have such 
participation. The Student Affairs 
Committee voted to increase its
student participation to four stu
dents and strongly recommended 
two year appointments to provide 
continuity. It also recommends to 
year appointments to all commit
tees which have student partici
pation.
The Committee was asked to 
react to student interest in the ex
tension of visitation hours in dor
mitories. Discussion centered on 
the needs of those students who 
chose not to use extended visita
tion hours.
The Committee recommends to 
the President that the current level 
of varsity sports be maintained and 
that the University consider join
ing an appropriate conference. We 
understand other campus groups 
are preparing position papers on 
this matter in order to assist the 
President in deciding the future 
place of varsity atheltics in the 
range of opportunities afforded by 
this University to its students.
There was an informal dis
cussion of the level of campus 
security.
Report of Chairman 
of Faculty Senate
Professor Daniel Re snick, 
Chairman of the Faculty Senate, 
after describing the make up of the 
Senate and five Senate Councils, 
reported on the operation of three 
Councils. The Student Affairs 
Council has on its agenda four 
items: the University athletic pro
gram, the functioning of Student 
Advisory Committees with the de
partments, an evaluation of health 
care and counseling services, and a
study fo the distribution of res
ponsibilities within the Division of 
Student Affairs. The Faculty Af
fairs Council has explored with the 
Administration the problems of 
the wage-price freeze and concur
red in the decision to freeze the 
salaries of roughly one-quarter of 
the faculty at last years levels, a 
committee of faculty and admini
strators having been appointed to 
adjudicate grievances; it has also, 
on the basis of a questionnaire, 
established the high priority as
signed by faculty to restoring the 
faculty chidrens scholarship grant 
program to the level of a year ago. 
The Research Policy Council is ex
ploring the relationship of tenure 
policies to long-term research and 
the administration and financing 
of research programs. The Plan
ning Council, after vacancies oc
curred in two vice presidencies, is 
presently concerned with recom
mending a revised administrative 
structure of the University. The 
Faculty Senate has met twice this 
term on matters of general interest 
and to hear reports and motions 
from the Councils.
Report of President 
of Student Government
Mr. Vincent Misitano, President 
of Student Government, discussed 
the change he has observed in the 
activity patterns of CarnegieMellon University students. (1) 
Student activism and militancy, 
which started about 1966, seemed 
to peak in 1969-70; it cut off 
sharply then. (2) As for the drug 
problem, there did not seem to be
one in 1968, but it began to build 
until the smoking of marijuana was 
blatant and open in the fall of 
1970. Now it seems to be tapering 
off, and what there is is kept under 
cover. In both areas the pendulum 
seems to be swinging back. 
Todays students are less inter
ested in service-oriented activities 
like Student Government; they are 
devoting nearly all their efforts 
toward their education, which is a 
healthy trend, long overdue.
Gifts and Grants
The Chairman reported on the 
list of gifts and grants received 
during the month of September 
amounting to $296,000 including 
$216,000 for the Fund for Dis
tinction and $11,500 for the new 
CMU Fund.
Presidents Report
The President curtailed his re
port to a few remarks: The wageprice freeze has frozen salaries of 
one group of the faculty who were 
not working at their new rate be
fore August 15. The mood of the 
campus is more like what it used to 
be; students are smiling more. With 
two vice presidencies open, it 
seemed an appropriate time to re
study the administrative organiza
tion of the University; I called a 
meeting last June to open the sub
ject, and the Planning Council of 
the Faculty Senate is now studying 
this topic, as Professor Resnick 
mentioned. A series of luncheons 
are being held for officers and re
search people from corporations 
to talk with our people and see the

EPC Meets
Last Monday, for the first time 
in quite a while, the Educational 
Policy Council met. There were 
three items of business on the 
agenda: pre-registration, library 
hours, and the goals of the univer
sity.
Questions had been raised as to 
the general usefulness of pre
registration. After lengthy debate 
of the pros and cons, it was de
cided to hold pre-registration for 
next semester. The earliest this can 
be done is probably December 6th. 
No classes will be canceled to allow 
students to participate in pre
registration, but the registrar is get
ting word out to the faculty, so 
that tests will not be scheduled 
that day, and so it will recognize 
that some students may not be 
able to be in class.
Student Senate has requested 
an extension of library hours for 
Friday and Saturday evenings. At 
present, both libraries are closed at 
5 PM, and students have com
plained that there is no quiet area 
on campus to study on weekend 
evenings. Several questions could 
not immediately be answered: Do 
students just want a quiet place to 
study, or do they require the refer
ence books? Are both libraries 
needed? What will this cost; Do 
students want just references or do 
they want to check books out?
Starting December 6 through 
the 16, the library hours will be: 
Mon-Fri 8 AM2:45 AM 
Saturday 9 AM2:45 AM 
Sunday 1 PM-2:45 AM
The goals of the university were 
briefly discussed and will be taken 
up at the next meeting. The idea 
here is to set up a list of priorities 
so that the money that is available 
will be spent in the high priority 
areas.

Virgil Fox is universally recog
nized by the largest audiences in 
the history of organ music (clas
sical and rock alike) as that instru
ments foremost virtuoso. But, 
breaking the rules of generations, 
Fox has explored and developed a 
wholly new tonal spectrum and a 
totally new style of playing, giving 
the organ hitherto undreamed of 
dimensions.
He gives as many as 70 recitals a 
season. New Yorks Lincoln Cen
ter chose him to inaugurate the 
new organ in their Philharmonic 
Hall. Last winter he took his 
unique Rodgers touring organ to 
New Yorks Fillmore East for two 
SRO concerts of Heavy Organ, 
an all Bach program accompanied 
throughout by an environmental 
light show. It was recorded live at 
the rock citadel by Decca, in
cluding the enthusiastic shouts and 
cheers of the audience.
Fox has appeared as soloist 
with many national symphonies 
such as the N. Y. Philharmonic and 
in Europe with the Paris Opera and 
others. He has performed in practi
cally every important center in the 
world, including Notre Dame de 
Paris and the Royal Albert Hall.
Accompanying the Heavy 
Organ act of Virgil Fox is the 
Pablo Light Show, a group of en
vironmental artists seeking to cap
ture the varying moods of music in 
light, color, and motion. Each Pab
lo show is unique and precisely 
programmed to the needs of the 
individual presentation. They have 
provided shows for such locations 
as Fillmore East, Carnegie Hall, 
and Madison Square Garden.
Prepare yourself for this multimedia concert involving the mas
terpieces of Bach, the powerful 
organ wizardry of Virgil Fox, and a 
beautiful light show of swirling 
patterns and colors on a huge 
screen.
Heavy Organ is sponsored by 
the CMU Activities Board. Tickets 
are $4, $5, and $6 and are available 
at CMU, Pitt, Duke, Hornes, and 
Kaufmanns. Ther performance 
will be presented November 20 at 
the Syria Mosque.
A certain number of what

Campus Parking
The Carnegie-Mellon University

general interest to the campus 
community.
It agreed to make the first order 
of business for this academic year a 
review of the point system through 
which spaces are assigned to fac
ulty and staff in the parking lots on

campus. Second, it instructed its 
members to reinstitute commit
tees from their constituencies so 
that its decisions could be made 
with better reference to the needs 
of the segments of the campus 
community now represented by it. 
Third, it decided that permits 
would be issued to staff members 
for spaces in the metered lots on an 
exceptional basis after a survey of 
their use by students has estab
lished the number of spaces which 
can be made available.
The Campus Parking Commit
tee consists of three members who
represent faculty, staff, and stu
dents. They are: Professor James 
Romualdi, representing the fac
ulty; Mr. Ray Colgan, representing 
the staff; and Mr. Jerry DiGennaro, representing the students. It 
is chaired by Mr. Ronald Taylor, 
Director of Security Services. The 
Committee recommends policies, 
procedures, facilities, allocation 
and assignment of space and regu
lation and control of parking facili
ties provided for campus use. Its 
recommendations are subject to 
approval by the Vice President for 
Business Affairs.

Sports
Editorial
Rumor has it that the white, 
middle-aged gentlemen who run 
the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) are spon
soring an anti-drug campaign with 
the motto, Get High on Sports, 
Not Drugs. This particularly 
caught my eye because this same 
subject came up at the last Athletic 
Board meeting. As we were evalua
ting the purpose of varsity sports 
on a college campus, one of the 
faculty members came up with a 
similar statement. Think back to 
your parents ideas of Keep the 
boys busy; keeps them off the 
streets. Yeah, its much the same 
vein of thinking. Seems that
coaches and parents alike (and the 
NCAA) believe that an athlete is 
also, by definition, a redblooded, clean-living, truth-telling, 
prepared patriot. Its the old allAmerican-boy syndrome. As I re
member the experiences of all my 
firends in jockland, (this is back in 
my high school days when drug use 
was hush-hush), their first contact 
with drugs was right there on the 
athletic field. If Johnny cut his 
hair and turned out for school ath
letics, he was in safe hands.
Sigh! Lets redefine athletics. 
The truth of the matter is that 
todays coaches have been feeding 
their athletes all kinds of wonder
ful things; anabolic steroids, am
phetamines, muscle relaxers, tran
quilizers, painkillers, and almost 
any other drug believed to aid ath
letic performance. Lets just say 
that Ive done some homework on 
said subject. Its sad but true, in 
athletics the stress is on winning 
and artificial stimulants, with no 
forethought by coaches and me
dics as to possible after effects on 
the athletes. A most striking exam
ple of this appears in Octobers 
Ramparts (sports section), and I 
quote, an athletic idol like Bill 
Toomey recently admitted to 
using drugs to aid his performance. 
. .Toomey, who comes across like
Mr. Clean on the CBS telecast. . 
.swore off drugs in 1968. . 
.returned to them in Mexico City
Olympics___I didnt take them to
get ahead of anyone, I took them 
just to stay even.
His statement on drugs rings 
true in every major college and 
high school power in the country. 
To stay even means the admini
stering of all the forementioned 
drugs by athletic coaches. I mean, 
how else can a team win? I say, 
what happened to the honest en
joyment of sports, the excitement 
of just being on the field?
What all this leads up to is a gold 
star for the CMU Athletic pro
gram. Other schools produce win
ning teams through mechanized 
athletics, and we refuse to con
form to the mold. Although Carne
gie teams arent tops on the field, 
our athletes win games without the 
aid of drugs. Through a program of 
honest athletic ability and good 
old-fashioned sweat, Carnegie 
teams relive sports traditions of 
the past. And I say, traditions like 
this are truly worthwhile. 
President Stever, does this give you 
some idea of the value our athletes 
and coaches place on varsity 
athletics on our campus?

Varsity Football Walloped
It had been 5 years since the 
CMU football team had been shut 
out. But when it did get shut out, 
last week, the Plaid made it a mem
orable occasion. Unfortunately, 
the bitter taste of Saturdays 50-0 
shellacking by Westminster will 
linger throughout the winter, com
pounded by the memory of the 
Tartans first losing season in 7 
years.
Usually, a sportswriter empha
sizes his own teams highlights, but 
this week, sadly, there were few, if 
any.
The game started out on a 
happy note, with the Tartans 
defense stopping the Titans the 
first two times they had the ball, 
once, 5 yards from the goal line. In 
the first quarter, CMUs offense 
moved well on the ground, but 
proceeded only to slow down.
Then, the defensive dam burst. 
Westminster drove 64 yards on 
four plays for a touchdown, the 
big play being a 40 yard Gene 
McNamara to Bill Cole scoring 
strike. John Ebersberger fcciked 
the point, and moments later con
nected on his second field goal at
tempt to put the Titans ahead 
10-0.
Westminsters Joe Veres then 
scored on runs of one and nine 
yards, putting the Titans ahead 
23-0 at the half.
Convinced that they still had a 
chance for victory, the Tartans 
looked forward to a second half 
comeback. But Westminster stop
ped the Tartans, first drive and re
turned the punt 60 yards fo* 
another touchdown, putting the
game out of reach.
Before 10 minutes had passed 
in the third quarter, Westminster 
scored 21 more, with two touch
downs scored on teh ground and 
one through the air. At the end of 
the third quarter the score had 
been completed, with Westminster 
scoring 50 to CMLP s 0.
The Tartans almost broke the 
shutout late in the game, marching 
to the Titan five yard line on pass 
receptions by Brian Carlock and 
Dan Maletic. However, a goal-line 
interception stopped the Tartans, 
and the gun sounded, ending the 
game.
With only the Case-Western 
Reserve game remaining, the Tar
tans are hoping to finish with a 
win, some consolation for a losing 
season.
In August, with perhaps the 
most talented offense to play here 
in quite some time and a strong 
defense, the team had looked 
ahead to an undefeated season. 
Somehow, the Tartans never put it 
all together. I look for a super ef
fort this Saturday as 8 CMU 
seniors play their last game, the 
toughest one to lose.
From the Bagpipe:
The Titans took their toll of 
injuries Saturday, too. Dan Maletic 
has re-injured his knee and John 
Radic has a severe muscle pull 
which could possibly shorten their 
season by one game. Everyone else 
is healthy, although still groaning 
frotp their most brutal game yet.

element of proof that soccer has 
been successful and is here to stay. 
In the last two years, the soccer 
team has won eleven, lost six and 
tied three, surpassed only by 
CMUs superb tennis team. How
ever, like the tennis team, it has 
been denied a chance to partici
pate in post season play. Is it that 
CMU has lost its interest in athletic 
competition, or is it simply afraid 
to find out how good some of its 
teams really are? Specifically, the 
tennis and soccer teams could have 
participated in NCAA or NAIA 
regional tournaments and done 
quite well. Its something to think
On The Right Track
about, for such competition could 
put a great deal of excitement back 
into campus life in the fall and 
spring.
The soccer team again wishes to 
thank its seniors for a job well 
done, Coach March Krotee for en
gineering the team with persis
tence and insight, and all its loyal 
supporters for the hours spent to 
that end. Next game is Saturday, 
September 27, 1972, against St. 
Francis. See y o then.

Imagine a CMU athletic team 
competing with the likes of Pitt, 
West Virginia, Syracuse, Ohio U. 
and the U. of Cincinnati. In most 
cases the results would be as ludi
crous as last weekends 50-0 loss to 
Westminster. Not so with the track 
team, one of CMLPs so-called 
minor sports. Last May at the 
Pitt Invitational Track Meet the 
Tartans fielded a small team of 
runners who surprised everyone 
(including themselves) by placing 
in total points ahead of Syracuse 
and nosing out West Virginia in 
two sprint relay races. To add to 
this, CMUs Tony McKay took on 
Pitts nationally ranked quartermiler, Smitty Brown, and finished 
only a few steps behind him in the 
^kne of 47.9 seconds. Mcfey was 
not even recruited for track at 
CMU.
: The point is clear: Carnegie has 
the potential within the student 
body to compete in track with 
major college powers and still 
maintain its de-emphasized atti
tude towards sports. Coach Gary 
Meckley has, in two years, deve
loped CMUs track program to a 
point where a college conference 
track championship is possible 
(PAC) and where CMU runners can 
compete with some of the better 
eastern track powersall the time 
stressing academics before athle
tics. Case-Western Reserve can do 
it, Harvard, Princeton, why not 
CMU? the track program is one of 
the least expensive and most flexi
ble in the athletic department, one 
in which no pressure is place on the 
student athlete.
So a word to potential runners, 
jumpers, weight men: On Monday, 
Nov. 15, at 4:30, a meeting will be 
held to discuss next semesters 
track program in the cross-country 
locker room beneath DonnerHall. 
Who knows, with a good student 
response, a so-called minor 
sport can continue to produce 
some very major results.

Anyone interested in being ma
nager for the track team leave a 
message for Coach Meckley in the 
Athletic Office, ext. 414. Also, for 
those who missed the Nov. 1st 
meeting, there will be another 
track meeting November 15, at 
4:30 behind Donner Hall near the 
Track. If you cannot make it but 
are interested, leave a message for 
Coach Meckley in the Athletic Of
fice.

CMUs varsity rifle team has 
done it again by defeating Geneva 
1265 to 1233.
The top five shooters were 
Wray Paul (259), Steve Roth 
(255), Ozzie Kemp (253), Elsbeth 
Weichsel (251), and Lewis On 
(247).
The teams next match is 
against Indiana University of Pa. 
and will be the toughest match of 
the season.
Elsbeth Weichsel
Victory is sweet, and a shutout 
is even sweeter, but Saturdays 4-0 
trouncing of Washington and Jef
ferson University had particularly 
saccharine overtones. Last year, 
CMUs soccer had played to a 0-0 
tie with W&J in a game marred by 
poor officiating. The booters were 
indeed eager and capable of assert
ing their superiority this year, and 
with the help of Goran Bencics 
hat trick, did so very handily. CMU 
dominated the game thoroughly 
and set up Bencics golden foot on 
three beautiful plays whil John 
Lape and his defense preserved the 
shutout.
For seniors Juan Neffa, Kenny 
Kern, Bobby Moroz, Jiri Dadok, 
David Gaudino, and Fred Yosua,
the game was a gratifying, fitting 
end to their collegiate careers. 
Each has given tremendously to 
soccer at CMU and for this the 
members of next years team are 
deeply grateful. Especially note
worthy and deserving of thanks is 
the selfless dedication which Ken
ny Kern and Bob Moroz displayed 
all season. Juan Neffa, showing his 
true concern for the team, left the 
football team and was instrument
al in his play and leadership as the 
booters won five and lost one after 
his return. Soccer has come a long 
way at CMU; Juan and his class
mates are greatly responsible for 
its successes.
Finally, CMUs authoritative 
victory over W&J is yet another
