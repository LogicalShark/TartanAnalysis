SWEEPSTAKES CUP
The program for the 1924 Senior 
Week has been carefully planned, 
and is just about in its final stage. 
A. R. Patton, general chairman, has 
been ably assisted by his sub-com
mittee and by the administration, j 
and the result is one of the most 
interesting and versatile series of 
events in which any class of Seniors 
has had the opportunity to take part.
The program has been mapped 
out so as to give the Seniors the 
best time they have ever spent at 
Carnegie. Included in the program 
are s athletic events and social af
fairs, along with the commencement 
address and the baccalaureate ser
mon.
The baccalaureate sermon will be 
delivered by Dr. William Chalmers 
Covert, general secretary of .the 
Board of Christian Education of the 
Prsbyterian Church of the United 
 States. Dr. Covert, a graduate of 
Hanover College and of the McCor
mick Theological Seminary, comes 
here on the recommendation of Rev. 
Hugh T. Kerr, pastor of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church. General 
Easker H. Bliss, United States 
.Army, will give the Commencement 
Day address.
Senior Week begins on Tuesday, 
June 3, and ends on Tuesday, June 
10. On Tuesday, June 3, the tennis 
courts will be reserved all day for 
the Senior men and women. The 
Senior Picnic will take place from 2 
to 6 oclock on Wednesday after
noon, June *4, on Neville Island.
On Thursday, June 5, there is 
scheduled the Womens Luncheon at
1 p. m. The swimming pool will be 
reserved for the Senior men from

Mingle at Mardi Gras
At nine oclosk Friday night the 
Mardi Gras of 1924 started off with 
a bang. Carnegie Tech ceased to be 
a school of hard working students 
und became a mass of pleasure seek
ing students and alumni. All of the 
old boys and girls from '09, 12 and 
all the rest of them were back 
Everybody threw himself in heart 
and soul for an evening of carefree 
fun.
Both the Langley Lab. and the 
Gym were cleverly decorated, the 
Lab. with gay colored streamers 
and the Gym with a wonderful re
volving globe that sent colors of 
all kinds scurrying over the floor 
and walls. Sometimes this globe 
would forget and leave a spot on the 
floor entirely dark for an instant. 
It is most peculiar what would hap
pen to a dancing couple in those in
stances.
The crowd was the same good natured crowd that we have at each 
Mardi Gras. It seems that it takes 
a Mardi Gras to make them that 
way. Their spirit was Eat, drink 
and be merry. There were lots of 
hot dog and all kinds of other stands 
to help them to do this. A continu
ous stream of people flowed between 
the two dance floors. The evening 
after a rather rainy start became 
perfect. The music continued, get
ting better and better; the crowd 
became gayer and gayer. One oclock

PICNIC SENIOR WEEK 
TO BE GRAND AFFAIR
One of the biggest events during 
Senior Week will be the Seniors pic
nic. This year the class lias decided 
to surpass every other class that has 
ever had a picnic. Extensive investi
gation has disclosed that they will 
probably make good at their attempt.
To start with, the picnic will be 
held on Neville Island, a most ro
mantic spot for anyone, let alone a 
Seniorplenty .'of shade tr|ees and 
room enough to enjoy oneself to his 
hearts content.
But that isnt all. Knowing that 
every one doesnt go into delirium 
over a picnic, with only the flies buzz
ing over their pie and cake, the com
mittee has picked a place that should 
please every one.
In the first place, there will be 
dancing. There is a large dancing 
pavillion on the grounds, with some 
of the best music obtainable. Then, 
there is a large fresh water swim 
ming pool on the lot. Besides these 
two big assets to the picnic, there is 
also a large baseball diamond, tennis 
courts, swings and plenty of sparking 
space(pardon us, we meant parking 
space).
The bunch wrill be rounded up 
Wednesday moving, and squeezed 
into some of the rolling stock of the 
Pittsburgh Railways, which will carry

Interclass Chess Tournament Fails' 
When Contestant Employs Slide Rule
The Inter-class Chess Tournament 
is apparently doomed to be a dismal 
failure due to a hitch in the rules. 
Having met with little short of dis
aster in its establishment, it appears 
that its brief life must be utterly 
blasted, and it is doubtful if it can 
ever recoup its position after this last 
disaster.
The plana for the tournament were 
fostered by Jimmie Robertson, who in 
the past several years has gained con
siderable fame about school for his 
activities in this particular sport, and 
was sponsored by Dr. Esquerre whose 
maxim, Athletics for everybody, 
and led him to advocate intra-mural 
contests for the physical development 
of the students.
Considerable trouble was at first ex
perienced in securing sufficient mate
rial to make up the teams, no men in 
Industries professing sufficient ac
quaintance with the game to risk 
their records against the intrepid 
players from Arts. This was finally 
remedied by making the Maggie 
Murphs taking House Making eligible
to enter through the Building Con
struction Department.
The next hitch was encountered 
when one of the rooks was found 
missing and the tournament had to 
be delayed until the Student Council 
furnished funds to purchase another. 
This matter having been remedied, 
the first two matches were played in 
the Skibo Inn last Sunday night, when 
the Science Seniors lost to the Amal
gamated Freshmen Class 6-0, 6-2 and 
G-0. The Margaret Morrison Fresh
men were hard pressed by the Science 
Seniors losing the first round G-4 but 
in the second half the Science men 
were penalized for holding and fell 
before the onslaught of the M. M. 
line. In the last lap, each side was 
determined to make up and the Mag
gie Murphs with doreens open, made 
such a vigorous attack, that their op
ponents line broke and only the un
timely closing of the Skibo saved the 
Science Seniors from demoralization.
Having so successfully opened the 
season, little doubt as to the efficacy 
of the tournament remained, until 
(Continued on Page Four.)
The Fifth Campus Week has turned 
out to be the best Carnegie has ever 
known. There was some disappoint
ment at first on account of the weath
er but each day the sun shone a little 
brighter, and the crowd waxed a little 
more enthusiastic. The Sporran, our 
Campus Week Gloom, put a damper 
on everyone who read it; we think | 
the editor and the weather man were 
in cahoots.
The vaudeville show on Thursday 
drew a capacity crowd. From the 
facetious five little prologues to tho 
more sober melodrama enacted by our 
husky football stars, each act was re
ceived with tremendous applause. The 
passionate Spanish Tango, executed 
by Anna Lurie and Warren Kimble 
was copied with variations at the 
Mardi Gras.
Qualification exercises were, as us\ 
ual, impressive, with the welding of 
the linkthe Plebe procession, ana 
the Kaper of the Kilties. The crown
ing of the Queen wras a triumph of 
loveliness, surely surpassing in beau
ty all former coronations.
The Blue Bandana proved a thrill
ing success. The audience sat tense 
on the edge of their seats, gasping 
as Chester Wallace showed himself 
to be a quick-change artist.
Friday morning the County Fair, 
with its display of live-stock and side 
shows was an appropriate setting for 
the wedding that took place. Crowds 
flocked from far and near to witness 
the ceremony but the blushing bride 
was self-contained and able to pro
ceed with her part, fearing only that 
the greasod pig would bo turned loose. 
Where were there ever to be found 
more graceful bridesmaids or dain
tier flower girls than this country 
brides attendants! Tho advent of

Mens Senior Banquet 
Will be Held on June 5
Graduating Men Will Eat at 
Lincoln Club
The 1924 Mens Senior Banquet 
will be held at the Lincoln Club on 
Thursday, June 5, at 6 oclock p. m. 
Preliminary tickets for this banquet 
will be out on the campus this week. 
Senior Banquet tags will be as much 
a mark of distinction for the men 
Seniors as the nice gray hats with 
the Plaid hands on them.
This will be tho last class banquet 
for the graduating Seniors, and will 
climax tho series of class banquets, 
which all have attended throughout 
their school career. They liked their 
peppery and secret Plebe banquet; 
they had a lot of fun at their noisy 
and important Sophomore banquet; 
they enjoyed themselves at their 
sophisticated Junior banquet; but 
they never fail to attend their 
Senior Banquetit eclipses all the 
others.
Beany Lowstutter still remains 
silent as to the innovation which 
will be a feature of this years 
Senior Banquet. Practically a 100 
per cent representation of all the 
men of the Class of 1924 is expected 
to be present at the Lincoln Club 
on the evening of June o. This will 
be the third day of Senior Week, 
and the banquet will serve to whet 
their appetites for the remainder of 
the Senior Week program.
The Senior Banquet will mean 
more to the men of the Class of 
1924 than any. of the other class 
banquets, inasmuch as it wrill be the 
last time they, will all be together, 
intimately. Here will be .their final 
splurge before their embarkation out 
into the world to steer their own 
ship.
CARNEGIE SONG BOOK
FINANCIAL REPORT
OF FIRST EDITION
Below will be found a financial 
statement issued by the Song Book 
Staff, covering the affairs connected 
with the issue of the first thousand 
Song Books to bear the name of 
Carnegie Tech.
As will be seen, a deficit was in
curred. That was to be expected. 
It is further noticeable that the big
gest cause for the deficit is due to 
the item, Stamps and Announce
ment Cards, $28.10.
That deficit is due to a vain effort 
to get Almuni to give a response 
worthy of their numbers. One Hun
dred and Fifty Orders from ThirtyFour Hundred People.Ho-hum.
A chance will be given Alumni to 
redeem themselves at the Annual 
Luncheon. In the meantime the 
book will be on display at the Regis
tration Desk. Take a look at it:

The sun shone brightly Saturday 
morning on the heads of the 
Sweepstakes Committee, who were 
desperately endeavoring to complete 
the last minute details necessary for 
the success of the Interfraternity 
Sweepstakes of 1-921. At the early 
hour of eight they could be seen 
marking off the course while the 
rest of tho world was sleeping off 
the effects of the Mardi Gras. 
Finally everything was completed 
and the event was run off as seeduled.
The first event of the morning 
was the Girls Dormitory Kiddy Car 
race. At 9:30 the starters gun 
cracked and they were off. The 
cars started in front of Central 
Building, went down to Margaret 
Morrison, then turned and finished 
in front of the Hut. The winning 
car was pushed by Gypsy Spears 
with Frances Talbot at the helm. 
Gypsy pushed like a veteran and 
won by a good maijgin. Forbes Hall 
now has a ' handsome cup to adorn 
the mantlepiece.
As soon as the girls sweepstakes 
were over the cars from tho various 
fraternities were judged for design. 
In doing this mechanical features 
and beauty were taken into consid
eration. This important task fell to 
the lot of Professors Leeds, Am
brose and Ashe. After much delib
eration they returned their verdict, 
with Delta Tau Delta first and Beta 
Thettt Pi second. Tho cars then 
wore taken to Machinery Hall where 
they were weighed. Each car Avas 
required to woigb nt loast sixty 
pounds. From Maohinory Hall tliey 
paradod up to tho starting point in 
front of Margaret Morrison. Tho 
camera man was busy all tho time 
with his picture machine. At the
starting point the cars drew for po
sition andtook tlioir place on the 
lino. Doc Marks then produced a
handsome ni.ckel plated revolver and 
repeated the magic words Talco 
your marks; got set; Bang." Off

last car had passed over tho brow 
of Toch Streot Hill. There wore

Blue Bandana Takes

Chester Wallaces Dual Role 
is Feature of Show
Campus Comment
By SARA MAE EVERETT
Nov/ is a good' time to consider 
next Campus Week, 6 C. W. 5 C. 
W. is past history, but what his
tory! Next year, what are we going 
to do and how?
Did you like the present arrange
ment of events.? Here is what some 
of the girls think:
I liked everything excepL having 
the show on Thursday and a dance 
on Saturday. It is a much better 
thing to have the show on Saturday 
night, when one can just sit still 
and be entertained. It is next to im
possible to be entertained on the 
last night of Campus Week. 
Another girl says:
"The show should be on Saturday 
and the. dance on Thursday, because 
after the Mardi Gras we are all too 
tired to dance.
The girls are not the only ones 
who dislike the present aiTangement. 
There are some of the men, too, who 
would rather see The Blue Ban
dana," etc., on the last night of the 
celebration week.
The argument the administration 
put forth in favor of having the 
show on Thursday is that they think 
it too hard on the girls to dance 
three night straight. I think, how
ever, that this wont hold, because 
it isnt dancing that tires one, its 
lack of sleep, and one loses just as 
much sleep at a theater as at a 
dance.
It is the concentrated opinion of 
the student body that will get the 
thing across the way it should be 
done. Which arrangement do you 
like tho best?
We can consider this phase of our
C. W. again) later on. Would Jt not 
be fitting to devote a little space 
to a eulogy on the Campus Week of 
?924? No one will say that Jt wan 
not a success. We will rather agree 
unaminously that it was, and if 
there were a few resolutions and 
amendments to the constitution brok
en, we all have next year to keep 
them, a little, better.
Each year brings its own oppor
tunity for developing a stronger 
mind.
Thoro was a apodal squad of 
pollcomen at. tho Schenloy Thoator 
to witness tho doings of tho actors 
depicting tho Blue Bandana! Tho 
management was under a. groat 
strain during tho porformanco, for 
fear that tho house and its occupants 
would bo plnchod. Thoro Is a. rea
son! Somoono lot out tho dope on 
.the play in such a mannor that tho 
city authorities and the dotoctlvos, 
police, lawyers and judgos got tho 
idea that tho original Blue Bandana 
Gang would bo uncovorod. Mr. Osborno was visited In tho morning by 
a detective but, after getting rid of 
him, he thought ho was through, al
though, he wasn't. An attorney came 
to him with a statomont that if any
thing which would give any news to 
thejury was shown in tho play, tho 
show would be closed. Well, every
one was fooled.
At 7:30 the house was being beseiged, and while the ushers were 
busy moving a piano, the man in the 
box office was holding back the 
crowd. Thedoors opened violently, 
and the rush was on. By 8:43 every 
seat in the house was filled, and the 
show began. Gradually, the people 
began to. leave their seats, rising 
right into the air, due to excitement. 
For a moment, in the first act, the 
audience was altogether unseated, 
for they werent sure whether Mr. 
Wallace was himself or some one 
else. Then, after they found out he 
was him, nad neither of the other 
two, they subsided.
The chief role, or the dual role, as 
given by Mr. Wallace, was a piece of

A USEFUL CATALOGUE OF
SELECTED MILITARY BOOKS
To R. O. T. C. students is of spe
cial interest a Descriptive Catalog of 
Selected Military Books that is now 
being distributed gratis by the Quar
termaster Association, 1024 II Street, 
N. W., Washington, D. C. The books 
are arranged according to subject 
(strategy, tactics, military history, 
physical training, infantry, cavalry, 
etc.), only a limited number of stand
ard works being listed under each 
heading. After every title are given 
the name of author, year of publica
tion, number of pages, and a brief de
scription of tho book. Because of its 
arrangement, this catalog, which In 
the first of its kind that has ovor boon 
published, Is also a splendid, reliable 
guide to military literature. It will 
be of great help not only to military 
men, but also to civilian librarians, 
who will be especially interested In 
the complete and admirable manner 
in which the subject of military his
tory is covered. Copies can be ob
tained gratuitously upon application 
to the Quartermaster Association.

this phase of tho Senior Week Pro
gram is planning to make it attrac

undorgraduato body.
The Commencement Ball will bo

DAI) WHYTE RETURNS 
FOR C. W. FESTIVITIES
Of tho many alumni and others 
who returned for Campus Wook, 
Dad" Wll I to was the oldest and one 
of tho most Intorontlng. Dad used 
to bo Mechanician of tho Machine 
Shop, and left Carnegie last Novom* 
her bocauso of sickness in his fam
ily.
Dosplto advice to tho contrary by 
doctors and moinbors of his family, 
Dad White camo all the way from 
Grand Rapids, Midi., for tho fifth 
Campus Wook. Ho carried tho silvor-hoaded cane which was present
ed to him at tho Industries Assem
bly before ho left, as a token of re
membrance.
Mr. Whyte was here1 at school In 
the same position (Mechanlcan of tho 
Machine Shop) for 17 years. He 
was always a great friend of every
ones, and was always anxious to 
help the students in every way he 
could.
Dad enjoyed every minute of his 
visit during Campus Week. Es
pecially did he enjoy seeing all his 
old friends again. Students and 
faculty were glad to see Dad come 
back for interest, such as he shows 
in doing so, is the thing that de
velops spirit quicker than anything 
else.

pvlzo 'or the best costumo.
After many wodts o. atronuom 
practlco In riding and pushing the 
baby conveyancos tho girls had be
come quite adopt in handling those 
go^buggios. So at tho time of the 
gun Saturday morning It was easily 
soon that tho competition would bo 
koon, but some of the entrants must 
have become oxcitod and lost tholr 
skill In handlingtheir machines m> 
a few casualties wero noticed as 
tho race proceeded.
The girls started in front of Cen
tral Building, went down Woodlawn 
avenue as far as the Maggie Murph 
building, where the pusher and rider 
changed places, then returned to the 
front of the Hut where the race 
ended.
The race was all over in a few 
minutes but was exciting while it 
lasted. Ail of the costumes worn 
by the girls were clever and added 
greatly to the general appearance 
of the race.
Last Issue of Technical J6urnal for 
Year to Appear on Campus Tomorrow
The last issue of the Technical 
Journal for the year will appear on 
the campus tomorrow noon and a 
number of articles worthy of note 
have been incorporated in it. This 
number is boing put out by the new 
staff and hence should bo of interest 
bocauso of the now ideas it must of 
necessity contain.
Perhaps the outstanding feature of 
the issue is the excellent quality of 
tho articles embodied in it. Of par
ticular interest In a discussion of 
Chemical Engineering Education by 
Dr, .T. H, James which brings out a 
number of horotoforo undlncussod 
points and accents various conditions 
which have been frequently over
looked by onglnoors.
Mr. H. 'I'. Houlo of tho Taylor In
strument Companies gives a detailed 
explanation of tho automobile regula
tion of temperature In Industrial pro
cesses showing tho various systems j 
now In use and pointing out their | 
good and bad features.
The relation of the engineer to pa
triotism is a somewhat new concept 
brought forth by Professor Follows of 1
the Commercial Engineering Depart
ment in that he presents the engineer 
as the greatest patriot of all in his 
function of eliminating waste and pro
ducing economy.
Dr. Rlttman and Ely, Consulting En
gineers of tho Giant Power Survey, 
after much persuasion, prepared the 
first report of their findings and this 
report should he of groat interest, to 
anyone at all associated with manu
facturing because of the possibilities 
shown for Industrial development.
An explanation of our pseudograveyard beside Machinery Hall ex
plains the error of the belief that un
fortunate Plebes aro consigned here, 
but that a now building material of 
romarkablo ponnlbllltlos Is boing de
veloped here and tho various tents 
employed to establish the host meth
ods of manufacture to give maximum 
strength aro outlined.
With this group of articles the 
Journal is able to present what Is 
perhaps the best issue of the year and 
tho staff wishes to thank the students 
for the assistance and support they 
have tendered the Journal.

CHAPTER OF A. I. C. E. IS 
INSTALLED AT CARNEGIE
Alter this issue oi the SENNIOR,GNTY TARTAN the present editor 
will again become irresponsible. Each year there comes a time when 
tho old steps down and the new step up. Beginning next week n new 
light will shine out in place of the comparative dim one which lias 
struggled xor expression for the past year. May this new light shine 
brilliantly, and perform all that everyone hopes for it. May its suc
cess as an important factor in the welding together oi alumni, lacnlty, administration and students into one unit for the good of 
Carnegie surpass any which lias.gone before. May he prove the wis
dom oil his choice.
And now in passing, may the outgoing editor take this oppor
tunity of thanking all who have co-operated with him and appeal to 
those who have for some reason or another withheld theirs; may he 
thank tho members ol! the staff who so loyally gave him and Carnegie 
their best, and may lie also express his sincere apologies to everyone 
concerned for any mistakes which ho has made.
As to our mistakesand they are not a few eitherthe present 
editor asks your indulgence in remembering the frailties ol! the hu
man mind, and to please remember that even though we slipped 
a few times, wo were ever trying to write for the best interests ol! 
Carnegie.
As for the incoming Editor-in-Obiof, Fred C, Smith, ho is good. 
This is a simple word; but as bad can express a multitude of sins, 
so can this word express a multitude ol! virtues, ~lo will work for the 
good of Oarnegio, and what moro do wo ask'll
AN APPRECIATION
)>*' ' ------------------Despite tho fflet that tho Spomm, gloom shoot ol! Campus Week, 
was most emphatic in its denunciations ol! the oommittoomen who 
performed such bonqlleial labors for the good of Carnegie Spirit and 
fellowship, the fact must be known that this same group of committoomon did clo great work, and not only are they due the sincere 
thanks of tho student body and alumni, but they are duo all con
gratulations that we can urge upon them.
This is tho writers ilfth Campus Week, and he can truly say, 
that it fully came up to tho standards Of those set before. Wo won't 
say that it was hotter, but as long as it equals tho high standards 
set by those which have gone before, tliero can possibly bo no kick 
whatever.
Cy" Comfort and his loyal band of co-workers .justly deserve 
that their names go down in tho annals ol! Carnegie men and women 
who do.
As for ad verso criticism, there are none that can be made. 
Despite the fact that many students are inclined to criticize tho com
mittee for putting the Sweepstakes on Saturday morning after Mardi 
Gras, this paper believes it was for the good of all concerned in that 
it gave an added attraction to Alumni Day. Without a doubt, this 
event is one of the unique and unusually attractive features of Cam
pus Week, and in order to give those alumni who could only return 
to the Campus on that day an opportunity of getting all thrilled 
with the student body over them, it cannot be helped but realize that 
the change was a good one.
We were especially glad to see the enlarged number of alumni 
who returned. This fact in itself is a most potent argument that Car
negie Alumni are becoming more and more a solid and loyal group of 
men and women.
And so we close with the simple word addressed to the commit
tee: CONGRATULATIONS.
Every fraternity man in America 
ought to read this little book, says 
M. L. Burton, president of the Univer
sity of Michigan, in the preface. 
"What are you here for? "Why 
study? "How To Study, and "The 
Fraternity; Millstone or a Mile
stone? are some of the subjects Old 
Man Dare discusses In a pungent, di
rect fashion that allows of no evasion 
by ovon the most unthinking under
class man, or fraternity alumnus. 
"You aro here, he says, "to acquire 
stamina, sympathy and scholarship, 
"You are here to store culture and to 
create power.
."Old Man Dares Talks To College 
Men," by Howard Bement, has re
cently been added to the Carengle 
Library, and would be valuable read
ing for every one, whether In school 
or out.

looked so much alike, and he fooled 
everyone so completely. Mr. Os
borne was even fooled once! He 
thought Dlclc was Jim, but it wasnt 
so.
Miss Ellen Lowe, Mr. Wallaces 
"partner in crime. was exceptionally 
good. She carried the audience 
along with her through all of her 
terrible' trials, and wonderful ex
periences. We pitlod her, we envied 
her, wo wondorod for hor, wo help
ed hoi1invisiblyand wo chQorod

real heroine;
Austin Coughlin, as Dugan, valet 
do chambro to Richard Haskell, 
portrays In a delightful manner, the 
trials and tribulations of protector 
of tho master's strong box, and 
cleverly relieves the tension after 
every qltinas. Coughlins performance 
was of decided merit and rivals his 
Richmond In Richmond 111.
Bon Weinblatt, tho detective, was 
almost professionalwe mean pro
fessionally detective, for Ills acting 
was professional. With Ills accent, 
his brogue, his appearancemake

would easily be mistaken for a Pitts 
burgh detective.
On the whole, the show was the 
best thing that has been presented 
on the Campusso say the students! 
This is a real fact, and everyone has 
voiced his or her opinion favorably 
on the show. Mr. Osborne says lie
wrote in in eight days, and had a 
great deal of fun with it. We dont 
see yet how any person could get his 
characters into such a tangle and re
member where they were well 
enough to straighten it all out again. 
To Mr. Osborne goes much glory, 
and to New York goes the luck of 
having this show' next season!
Both nights were big affairs, 
Thursday the Students packed the 
house and Saturday the Alumni 
filled the theater. We are unable to 
say which was the better perform
ance, but we are a student, and 
hence, we aro prejudiced in favor of 
the Thursday night show.

The ceremony last Thursday of thej

us Weok was a very beautlfut one. 
The many colored frocks of the 
ladles-in waiting, the striking bril
liancy of the Archbishop's robes, and 
the aroyal beauty of the Queen 
herself succeeded in fulfilling tho ex
pectations lor this most artistic 
Campus Week traditions. Miss Gib

ered as befitted one of so proud a 
rank.
Paul McGrath, as the Archbishop, 
carried his goregeous cerise.ecclesias

nity. The herald sounded his an

the court in front of Resign School. 
First came the malds-of-lionor, in 
rainbow-shaded gowns of the Eight

GOOD EVENTS FEATURE
FIFTH CAMPUS WEEK

tho groasod pig was something en
tirely now on tho Campus. Nobody 
know quite what to do with him or 
how to capturo him until ono enter
prising youngster approached cau
tiously with a salt-sellor, and having 
succoedod In overpowering the crea
ture, was In turn, overwhelmed by the 
eager mob. Medical aid was needed 
and Bert Munhall was paged. Later, 
ho was awarded the prlvilego of bear
ing homo tho uncooked pork as a 
mark of appreciation.
The aftornoon tennis match and 
the track meet proved unfavorable 
to Tech, but the Mardi Gras came up 
to everyones expectations. Langley 
Lab. and the New Gym. were a mass 
of riotous colorboth decorations and 
costumes were rare and unusual in 
design. The Myriad Mirror Moon, in 
the Gym. a new 'feature, was a de
cided attraction, shedding its bright 
spots of color fitfully over the dancers.
The morning afterwell, of course 
the Kiddy Kar race couldnt start on 
time, but nevertheless it was a good 
race. Forbes Hall, with the superior 
agility of Gypsy Speers and.Frances 
Talbot, came in first. The Sweep
stakes was as exciting as usual. Del
ta Tau Delta took the cup for beauty 
of design, and Kappa Sigma for the 
second time, came to the finish ahead 
of the rest, with the exception of that 
remarkable vehicle steered by Tom
my Griggs and pushed by the Cops.
The Girls Banquet, an annual event 
that never fails to attract both flie 
students and alumni of Margaret Mor
rison and Arts, was held in the Com
mons, on Friday evening. As a last 
touch of excellence, the Blue Ban
dana was ropeated for tho alumni, 
and all who were not exhausted as a 
result of tho strenuous week, attendod the finale Hop, held in tho Gym. 
and Lab.
So tho G C. W. camo to a close. I 
Nothing lo do now, but wait until! 
noxt year.
As the old grads rolled on to the 
iqampUtt on Fridjay mqmin,g they 
were attracted by the crowd which 
was scurrying out Woodlawn toward 
Forbes street. Following the crowd 
they found themselves plump in the 
center of a big country fair. Row 
after row of tents and stands dec
orated the grounds. The bellowing 
of cattle mixed with the grunting 
of sleek porkers and the neighing of 
horses gave the fair the final 
touches.
Because of such large crowds it 
was almost impossible to get around 
to all the booths but those who were 
adept at getting through started off 
by getting a supply of Rieck bal
loons. Then came the Velvet tobac
co display which furnished every
thing for a smokers fancy except the 
inclination. Freak displays of all 
kind could be seen by entering the 
different tents. Chief among these 
was The horse with his head 
where his tail should be and "The 
Bad Egg. Other features which 
attracted much attention were the 
fancy dancers, tho wedding, and 
horse back riding.
The County Fair has been pro
nounced by all A raging success. 
It has been reported that the girls 
in the domitories have a stock of 
Colgates sufficient to last until next 
year. It has also been stated that 
Bill Pfouts and Cap Dorsey have 
plenty of Velvet to last until fall.
SENIORS WILL HOLD
BIG SWIMMING PARTY
A new feature of Senior Week will 
be the swimming parties in the new 
gym. They wilL more than likely be 
one of the most popular events dur
ing the entire week.
The Senior Mens swim is sched
uled to be at 2:00 p. in., Thursday, 
June 5. After a week of frivilous 
gaiety, a swimming party should 
look good to our tired and wornout 
Seniors. Later in the afternoon the 
women will have their swim, namely 
te 4:00 p. m.
Friday, June C, will be the big 
eventthe combined men and worn 
ens swim. This will have many 
interesting features. Numerous con
tests will be held and prizes will be 
awarded for racing and fancy div
ing. The committee lias taken it up
on themselves to secure the most re
liable judges that could be had.
You neednt worry about anything, 
for each praticipant will be provided 
with a locker key, and if anything 
goes right towels may even be sup
plied. Announcement of the later 
will be made next week.
Tho swimming parties are a new 
innovation and it is hop'ed that every 
Senior will take advantage of the 
opportunity to swim in our new pool. 
More about this next weok.
LOST AND FOUND
A garbardiue top-coat was left at 
the Sigma Epsilon Phi Fraternity 
house, - 4929 Forbes street, last 
Thursday evening at the Migratory 
danco and one taken in its place. 
In tho coat taken there was a pair 
of glasses. Will tho person who 
made the mistake please call at the 
Sigma Epsilon Phi IIouso and iden

F. C. SMITH TO HEAD
TARTAN NEXT YEAR
Campus Week is over again. We 
welcomed it, of course, for it means 
a period during which studies can be 
forgotten and fun and frivolity taken 
up in real earnest. Those of us who 
have experienced a Campus Week be
fore knew what to expect. To the 
plebes who had not had this oppor
tunity it w*as something new and 
something that they will never forget. 
The fantasy of the Mardi Gras, the i 
thrill of the coronation ceremony and ' 
the struggles in the athletic contests I 
all go to make up the most enjoyable I 
week of the year for the undergrad-1 
uates.
But Campus Week Is not alone for, 
the students. It also performs a great | 
service to Carnegie for it is a means : 
of drawing back to the campus a large ! 
body of our alumni, who might not; 
otherwise come, and thereby increase I 
their interest and pride in their Alma I 
Mater. This is the primary function I 
of CampuB Week and every year a I 
larger and larger number come back. I 
It is an inspiring sight to see the old 
grads meet on the campus and to hear j 
them talk over the old times again, j 
And as the years go by and the num
ber of alumni increases Campus Week 
will come to mean more and more. '
Campus Week has become a tradi-1
tion at Carnegie. And embodied In 
it are other traditions such as the 
Qualification Day ceremonies, the Call 
and others. It is a tradition as Pleba 
Regulations or Fools Day celebration 
are traditions. And traditions are 
rather important to any college for 
because of them there is a distinction 
between what we call our Alma Ma
ter and a place where we might go 
to acquire knowledge.
We grow to love our college by its 
traditions for they are inherently sen
timental and any college which does 
not produce some sentiment or emo
tion in the hearts of its students is not 
worthy of the name. It is rumored 
that there is considerable opposition 
in the faculty here to Campus Week 
on the grounds that it takes the stu
dents mind off his work too much. It 
does take the students mind off their 
work, but isnt that a good thing to 
do once in a while? While all of ua 
are here presumably to learn some
thing yet there are very, very few 
who have such an insatiable thirst for 
knowledge that they cannot stop oc
casionally for a little fun. They 
would do it whether we had Campua 
Week or not, and by having Campua 
Week we not only have fun but there 
is also some good comes to our Alma 
Mater.

came and the spirit of the crowd 
was at its zenith. That last short 
hour betwreen one and two slipped 
away all too soon. Shortly before 
two the orchestra drifted into the 
strains of  Home Sweet Home and 
the Macdi Gras was over. We all 
think that this was the biggest 
and best real fun. We want this 
event to continue to bo the big event 
of the year, at a time when every
one forgets study work and every-1 
thing j\nd throws himself into the 
spirit of fun.

Victims, But Latter Stages

PLEBE TOSSERS LOSE TO 
UNION H. OF KNOXVILLEOn the Plaid Screen
In their second match of the year, 
the Freshman tennis team by dint of 
good playing and hard work defeated 
the Westmont High School team of 
Johnstown Dy a 4-2 score. The match 
was played on the Westmont Tennis 
<Jlub courts of Johnstown, last Tues
day. ,
In winning this tournament the Car
negie Plebes were compelled to play 
fast and accurate tennis, and they are 
due congratulations for their success. 
Westmont boasts of the OLoughlin 
brothers, of whom Davy was at one 
time National Junior Champion, and 
has also held the State Junior Cham
pionship. Davy took over the fresh
mens number one man, Tiffie McWil
liams in straight sets, but before he 
accomplished this feat, was compelled 
to play real tennis for McWilliams 
also played well. This match was 
scintillating throughout, featured by 
the accurate and hard ground-stroking 
of both players. McWilliams lost not 
because he played poorly but because 
Davy OLoughlin played exceptionally 
good. His playing was faultless.
The only other match won by West
mont was when the two OLoughlin 
brothers paired in doubles, present
ing team play that was not to be de
nied. Their parallel play was fault
less, with John OLoughlins overhead 
game deadly. McWilliams and Rudisill chose to play a lobbing game 
against their famous opponents, but 
practically always lobbed short; only 
to have them killed with almost ab
solute precision.
The freshmen took the remaining 
three singles and doubles. RudisiLl, 
playing number two accounted for 
John OLoughlin in two hard sets. His 
accuracy was more than the brilliancfe 
of OLoughlin could cope with. Coover

PITT RUNNERS TOO 
FAST FOR TARTANS
Showing the results of the lack of 
practice since the Indiana Normal 
game, the Plebe baseball team lost to 
the Knoxville Union High, Friday, by 
the score of 12-8.
The incessant rain of the past few 
days has kept the squad idle for a 
long time, and this with the superior 
pitching of the opponents was the 
cause of the downfall of the Plaid 
yearlings.
Just before the game, the squad 
held a meeting and elected Webster 
captain of the team. Webster is reg
ular catcher of the nine, but due to an 
injury did not play in the Union 
High game. He was formerly at 
Syracuse University, where he played 
on the Freshman team of that school.
The first inning started out with the 
Tartans being retired in 1, 2, 3 order. 
Union, however, found Harmon, and 
hammered him for four runs, before 
being retired. The latter team also 
scored two markers in the second 
frame, leaving the visitors with their 
usual circular score. The third inn
ing livened up, for Carnegie got three 
men on the bases, but no runs were 
scored.
In the fourth, Esclier replaced Har
mon on the mound, and succeeded in 
holding the enemy down, but the fatal 
first inning lead could not be over
come by the Skibo swatsmiths. The 
Union High pitcher was quite good 
and kept the Plaid bingles pretty well 
scattered. Diffley, Lynch and Bowser 
did the best work for the Plebes. The 
lineup of the Plebe team was as fol
lows:
Pitch, Plarmon, Escher; catcher, 
Diffley; first base, Lynch; second 
base, Bowser; third base, Snyder; 
short stop, Voigt; center field, Plum
mer; right field, Scliweinberg; left 
field, Stoner.
in number three, playing a hard and! 
accurate driving game, practically 
won through letting Leahey defeat 
himself. Leahey was plainly off-form 
in his drive, sending them, outfor 
points favoring the Carnegie player. 
Hughes completed the singles by de
feating Hinkel of Westmont. The 
plaid number four man made good use 
of a very deceptive drive and good 
net work.
When Coover and Hughes went into 
the final sets, the score sfood 3-2 in 
favor of the freshmen. A defeat 
would mean only a tie match, and 
a victory assure the plebes of a tour
nament victory. Realizing their bur
den, the freshmen players literally 
tore into their high school opponents, 
Hinkel and Leahey, and vanquished 
them without much ado, 6-2, 6-1.
In defense of Westmont it must be 
admitted that they were slightly offform due to lack of practice, this be-, 
ing their first match of the year. At 
the same time, due credit must be 
given to the freshmen in that they 
surely played tennis as was necessary 
in order to win.
PLEBES BEAT PITT FROSH
After Carnegie Tech had been van
quished in three events by her an
cient rival, the University of Pitts
burgh, the pleT)es upheld the name of 
Carnegie by overwhelming the strong 
Pitt freshman tennis team by the 
score of five matches to one.
This one was lost by McWilliams, 
the Plebe captain, who was defeated 
by Cable of Pitt. The match was hard 
fought and Cable was victorious in 
straight sets, 6-3, 6-4. Rudisill, a for
mer West Point Cadet, took McQuiston of Pitt over by the score of 6-2, 
8-6. Incidently, McQuiston played for 
the Allegheny varsity last year, which 
speaks well for Rudy. Coover, play
ing number three men for Tech, was 
carried to three sets by Colvin of 
Pitt, but the Tech Plebe was not up 
to the form he displayed at Johnstown 
on Tuesday. Hughes made it three 
out of four in the single matches for 
Carnegie by defeating Gordan of Pitt 
to the tune,of 6-4, 8-6. In the doubles 
McWilliams and Rudisill defeated 
Cable and McQuiston 6-3, 6-2. The 
Tartans had. everything their own 
way, advancing to the net and smash
ing kills for sure points time after 
time. Rudisills ' volleying in this 
match was remarkable. In the final 
match of the afternoon Coover and 
Hughes won their second match of 
the afternoon by defeating the number
2 Pitt doubles team in straight sets.
WESTMONT GETS REVENGE
They came, saw and conquered the 
Carnegie Tech Plebes. The score was 
3-1. The Westmont High School of 
Johnstown arrived Friday night, saw 
the Mardi Gras, played Pitt at 2 
oclock and Carnegie Tech at 5, and 
went home with two victories.
The Plebes suffered their first re
verse of the year in a match which 
brought into action the famous 
OLoughlin boys.' Davey showed with 
particular brilliance in disposing of 
McWilliams, 6-1, 6-1, while John was 
not quite good enough for Freddy 
Rudisill who won the only match for 
Carnegie, 6-2, 8-6. Coover was way off 
form and was defeated by Leahey In 
three lrard sets. Hughes seemed to 
have a sure victory in his hands, tak
ing the first set 6-2. However, he 
lost the second set 6-3, and the third 
set was anyones until Hinkle broke 
through and won the set, 8-6. The 
match was called after McWilliams 
and Rudisill had defeated Dave 
OLoughlin and Leahy, 8-6 in the first 
set, so that the higlj school boys 
could attend the Campus Week show 
at the Schenley Theater.

CONGRATULATIONS C. W. COMMITTEE
Each succeeding Campus Week seems to be better than the one before 
and this one was no exception. The only thing we have to kick about is the 
rain, which forced the cancellation of several athlotic events. However, the 
events which did take place were of such high caliber and so interesting that 
the unfortunate omission of one or two contests did not make much differ
ence in the program as a whole.
Among the notable events of the week was the appearance of Judge 
Wally Steffen at the Alumni Banquet on Saturday. Steffen was received 
with wild acclaim by the Alumni and gave a typical Steffen speech. We did 
not hear it. but from the comments, it must have been good. We should 
have been delighted to hear Wally address the entire student body, but he 
could not be in town for the entire celebration, and such an occasion could 
not have been conveniently arranged.
It must have been a treat, though, to the old grads, for Steffen has been 
the idol of the campus ever since he took over the responsibility of running 
the Plaid football team.
It is unofficially reported that Bob Waddell, assistant coach, was on 
hand for the greased pig chase' in order to get a line on future football ma
terial. But it so, happened that said pig did not know his stuff so well, and 
Bob was frustrated in his efforts.

TO INTRODUCE THE NEW SKIPPER
It is the natural order of things that youth should be served, and each 
year at this time, the various positions on the Tartan staff are subject to 
change. The older members step up or down, as the case may be, and new 
ones step in to fill their places. But the organization is preserved, tlfe paper 
keeps on improving with the passing of each year.
The athletic editorship of any newspaper is a position of responsibility. 
It is especially so on the Tartan, for the holder of that postion conducts the 
Plaid Screen, the most important column in the paper outside of the regular 
editorial column, conducted by the Editor-in-Chief. The wrong man in such 
a position could do immeasurable harm to the school and to the paper, for 
the Athletic Editor is practically king of his department and its policies.
What we are driving at is the fact that this page will be conducted by 
Joe Christoff from this time on until he in turn relinquishes his hold to a 
worthy successor. Joe has worked on the paper for two years, and besides 
being an athlete himself is in constant touch with the athletic situation 
through being employed part-time in the office of the Graduate Manager. 
He s a writer of ability, and to the best of our knowledge is a clear thinker.
The present Editor retires from his chair with the feeling that a com
petent man is taking his place. Good work, Joe!
CAMPUS WEEK SPORTS
The week in sports was not so good. Two victories out of eight events 
is the record. The varsity tennis team lost to the Uinversity of Pittsburgh, 
and to the Alumni team. The Plebe team turned in the only victories of the 
week, having defeated the representatives of Westmont High School and the 
Pitt Freshmen; Westmont High evened the score by winning from the 
Plebes in a return match on the home courts, however.
The Plebe tossers lost to the Union High of Knoxville nine, and the 
Varsity and Plebe track teams lost to the corresponding teams of our neigh
bor, University of Pittsburgh. The Plaid athletes need feel no sense of clisgrace, however, for it is generally conceded that this is a leanj soason for 
the Tartans in the world of sports, and coaches are building for the future.
-.The Showing of the track team was rather surprising at that, for our 
rivals had not conceded us a chance of winning anything but Howdy Dykemans event. The fact that our varsity captured first place in the mile run, 
both hurdle events, the quarter mile and the javelin throw would seem to 
indicate that our rivals rated us rather too low.
It is interesting to note that Mefort broke the school record twice in the 
same day in the javelin throw. His official mark, made in competition, was 
176.4 feet, a school record. But at the end of the regular competition, ho was 
allowed another try, in the nature of an exhibition, and on this uttempt 
hurled the javelin through the astonishing distance of 180.5 feet.
Howdy Dylceman won the mile run in great stylo and nearly won the 
two-mile event. It is agreed by most who saw the race that ho would have 
won the latter event had he not also ran the mile but a short time before.
Congratulations are due the Alumni tennis team. They have been striv
ing for a long time for this taste of glory.
MARD! GRAS GROPINGS
A cheering section formed in the bleeohers of Toch Field shortly after 
dark, but due to absence of a cheer leader, no cheering was done.
The police force is to be congratulated on their efficient guarding of the 
automobiles. To the best of our knowledge, not a one was stolen.
The lighting effect in the gym was one of the best things wo have seen 
for some time in the way of novel effects.
We have been trying to think of a few words to say about some of the 
costumes, but they dont seem to cover the subject very well.
Due to the incessant rain of the past few weeks, the Mardi Gras was 
not as dry as it might have been.________
SENIORS BEAT JUNIORS 
29-18 IN BASEBALL GAME
Saturday afternoon marked an
other stirring item in the history of 
five C. W. when the Maggie Murph 
Seniors beat the Juniors 29 to 18 
in a most thrilling baseball game.

The game was slightly late in 
starting but that gave the specta
tors time to gather and set their 
nerves before the excitement began. 
The Juniors put up a plucky fight, 
and were playing at a disantage be
cause one of their star players had 
been hurt on Saturday morning. The 
high lights of the game were sev
eral runs which were really home 
runs because the players took the 
counsel of the spectators and went 
from base to base with only slight 
hesitations. There were a number 
of flies also, that were too elusive 
to be caught.
One of the players unfortunately, 
became confused in the directions 
of the bases and ran from second to 
first in her mistake.
ALUMNI ARE GAYEST 
OF GAY AT MARDI GRAS
Another Mardi Gras lias rolled 
around and has been added to the 
history of Carnegie. Jupiter Pluvius 
was rather undecided as to whether 
he would allow another big event 
to pass without his trade mark on 
it. Accordingly he decided to make 
it a wet party but upon seeing the 
event was already damp he aban
doned the wet idea and let the rev
elers revel. They reveled from nine 
till two under the enchanting music 
of the Imps and Steel City Six.
It was a merry frolicking bunch 
that crowded the new gym and 
danced under the flickering light 
from a scientilating sphere as it
slowly revolved in the colored 
beams of light.
Alumni showed spirit and pop 
which rivaled that of the most jubi
lant and Buddy Ovorond says tlio 
spirit was not that of liquid nature. 
The Alumni camo in gay and color
ful costumes and colobratod as In 
flays of old. Although tired, they 
stuck until the last with their old 
time pep.
NOTICE TO VARSITY

peting In the Pitt Intercollegiate 
meet this Saturday at Schenley Oval

Friday proved an eventful day tor 
the Tartan track team. Defeat at the 
hands of Pitt, to the tune of SI to 45 
explains how powerful tho visitors 
were. The plebo team fared no bet
ter than the varsity, being triumphed 
over by the decisive score of 97 to 
19%. Carnegies only chance for vic
tory lay on the cinder path, where 
the Skibos annexed 31 points against 
Pitts 41. In the field events tho Pan
thers were too strong, registering 40 
points to our 14. Tho Plebes were 
so badly outclassed in tho fiold that 
they barely managed to get SMii points.
The event that brought the greater 
part of the spectators down onto the 
field, wasthe defeat of Howdy Dylceman by Ted Corbett of Pitt in the 
two mile run. With all due credit to 
Corbett, who showed wonderful form 
throughout the whole raco, and espe
cially in the last lap, one must con
sider that scarcely an hour before this 
run, Howdy won a strenuous mile. 
Had he not decided to enter the five 
lap event, he would have probably 
beaten the Panther. Corbetts early 
lead proved disastrous to Dykeman, 
who was unable to make it up until 
the ninth lap. Howdys clmnco for 
revenge comes next Saturday whon 
he will meet Corbett again In the Pitt 
Inter-Collegiates.
. Danny Kramer gave a great exhibi
tion of running when he out-steppod, 
very decisively, the Pitt entrios In the 
quarter-mile. Kramer took the load 
at the end of the first straightaway 
and steadily increased it, showing re
markable form on tho homo stretch. 
Jimmy Robertson carried off top lion* 
ors in the high and low hurdles. He 
was not pressed at any time in the 
high hurdles, and in tho low ho load 
over Smith of Pitt by a comfortable 
margin.
Mefort brolco his own rocord in tho 
javolin when ho throw tho stool-tipped 
spear a distanco of 176 foot 4 Inchon. 
A few minutoB later, In an oxhlbltlon 
toss ho. sot up a bettor record of 180 
feet 5 Inchos. Bill Robusch, Pitt's 
famous pole vaultor, easily cleared 12 
feet in nnothor exhibition of skill.

Old Timers Triumph by 
5-2 Score
Friday was a disastrous day for Car
negie in more ways than one, for not 
only did the Pitt track team trim our 
boys, but tho Panther tennis team 
was in excellont form and triumphed 
over Captain Smith's crew of racquet 
wleldors by a scoro of 5-1. Georgo 
Beecher was the only Tartan who 
could muster enough skill and con
sistency to omorgo victor ovor his 
man during the afternoon. Incident
ally, Beecher yet remains to bo de
feated in intercollogiato competition.
Captain Smith was Just beginning 
to hit his stride against Silverman of 
Pitt lato in their second set, but tho 
latter managed to pull through with 
a victory. Rogers put up a good fight 
against Linton, but could not seem to 
solve the Pitt mans deceptive service, 
which annoyed Rogers considerably.
The bright spot of tho afternoon 
was tho decisive victory of Beecher 
over Sperber. Tho Tartan had to 
display everything ho had in order to 
win. but at no time did his opponent 
get into the load.
The hardest fought match of the 
entire affair was the doubles between 
Silverman and Linton of Pitt against 
Smith and Beecher of Carnegie. Tho 
visitors took the first set 9-7, but lost 
the second 2-6. They captured the 
third, however, after a gruelling bat
tle.

ALUMNI 5, VARSITY 2
That the tonnls stars of tho past 
are superior to those now cavorting; 
about tho courts for tho glory of Carnogio was clearly shown Saturday aftornpon whon tho alumni dusted off 
tho varsity by a 5-2 scoro.
But It is no disgrace for tho varslty to ioso to tho alumni, for tho lat
ter can boast of somo of the host tonnls mon in Pennsylvania and it Is only 
necessary for thoso satno men to prac
tice a little in ordor to he able to 
copo with tho host In tonnls circlon. 
Tho mon who uphold tho honor of tho 
alumni during tho fifth Campus Weelc 
woro such stars as Connio -Schwartz, 
captain of last years' team, Jimmy 
OConnor, who went through tho soa
son practically unscathed last year, 
Toots Davis, tho Stanton Height 
ace, Wolf and Sohuchman.
Tho varsity men playod a great 
game against their renowned oppon
ents, but with tho oxcoption of Smith 
and Rogers, could not bring homo tho 
bacon. Captain Smith took ovor tho 
famed .Timmy OConnor, who appeared 
In togs for the first tlmo this year. 
Howover, tho way Smith wont after 
his man with heavy drives and ac
curate chops ho would have glvon 
OConnor it run had tho latter boon 
at top form. Rogors surprised ovon 
his closost frlonds by decisively trim

THE TELESCOPE
CAMPUS WEEK
The annual clbration lo over and the otudcnt body hao again octtlcd 
down to the final opurt which shall carry them over the top In the final cx-i 
aminations, which begin very soon.
In general, wo believe it must bo 
Httld that tho fifth Campus Week was 
a decldod JVMMUBJG On tho wholo, 
tlio affair wus managed Just a lit
tle better, thing ran off Just a little 
Binoothor, co-oporutlon was jtiBt a 
little more evidenfc than in former 
years. That 1b but natural. 13von 
youth .L able to profit by experience 
and oftentimoB dooB.
The Couinty Fair.
Enumeration of tho vu'rious events 
1L too laborlouB, but special mention 
1L doBCrvod by tho people responslblo l'or the County Fair. The whole 
thing waa a litigo buryoaquo, of 
coui'Bo, but that waa to bo oxpoctod. 
It waB LU welt received by tho spectatorB, that we can hardly eoncelvo 
of a C. W. in tho future without 
this adjunct aa one of the featuroa.
The Quoen.
Especially improaaivo thia year, 
waa tho coronation of tho Queon of 
tho Campua. Tho picturoa taken by 
moving picture concorna can not pos* 
aibly do her justice. She ia, in 
every aenae of tho word, a poach, 
and no miatako about it. The whole 
ceremony proceeded without a hitch 
and left nothing to be doaired except 
a stage where the affair can take 
place and yet be viewed by' the 
populace. We should like to auggeat 
that if Mr. Orbln will agree, the 
campus green be left intact until 
after the festival next year, and that 
the coronation take place on tho 
mops of Machinery Hall.
Pitt
Tho athletic eventa were not ao 
successful as tho rest. Tho inclem
ent weather and the small attend
ance provided a lltting scenery for 
tho disastrous contests. It must 
not lie thought that C. I. T. did not 
contest tho visitors from tho hill, 
but unfortunately wo can never liopo 
to p'ut in tho tlmo and effort in 
training for athletic eventa that 
must bo put in to havo a successful 
team against oppononts from institu
tions whore such tlmo is available. 
At any rate, wo will allow Pitt that 
they boat us squarely and fairly. We 
will BXU you noxt fall and we will 
'bo back In tho old grandstand too, 
every mothors son of us. Win or 
Lose.
The Luncheon.
Tho Alumni events passed off llko 
clock work. The luncheon was a docidod Buoooss and tho women's ban*
(juet 3VL equally pleasing. Tho 
new gym provided a setting with
out' parallel for tho gathering of 
Seniors und Alumni to hoar I>r. 
Baker and Wally apeak. Any who 
believe that all Alumni havo ioat 
Intereat in tho school are mistaken. 
Carnegie Alumni are for Carnegie, 
and when wo have the WhoJo gang 
together noxt year lot us raise the 
roof. Onward, Alumni our numbers 
aro increasing next year. Now 
blood will bo added at tho end of 
this year. Get thoir spirit. Make 
your motto: FOIt THIS GOOD OF
CARNEQlJfl.

Due lo a general paucity of money 
about the campus during Campus 
Week, about two hundred Sporrans, 
the C. W. daily, of the Friday and 
Saturday Issues are available for 
Alumni who wore not fortunate 
enough to make their pilgrimage.

It is up to tho Clans now to be

fall about getting the new members 
out. The/ (graduating claaa want

know of none more effective than 
getting young pooplo with tho aeal

Oh yos, make them work. Make

The over-incroasing number of 
Alumni and Alumnae, who return 
bach year for Campus Week assure 
us that before long, wo will havo all 
of them back, but there is a terrible 
difference between tho number eliglblo to register at the Registration 
Dock and those who' do. We cant 
all bo back, but wo can nil try to 
got back. Campus Woolc is Alumni 
Woolc, and it should not be forgotton 
that without tho Alumni, Campus 
Wook would auffor an untimely dowlso. Lot us got busy now. Wo can 
do aome thing toward getting a vory 
much larger number boro for next 
year, no let us begin to do It now.
An organization meeting was held 
recently by tho Johnstown Alumni. 
Detaila of the affair havo not reach

Orders for one hundred and seven

tho Carnegie Song Book Staff at the 
Alumni luncheon which was held in 
tho New Gymnaalum Saturday, May 
17. Tills makes a total of two hun
dred and fifty hooka of the aecond 
edition which have already been 
Bold to Carnegie Alumni. ThiB num
ber comparea favorably with one 
hundred and fifty hooka of the first 
edition which were secured by the 
Alumni. Samples of the hooka were 
on display at the luncheon and ap
proval of the second edition of the 
Song Book was heard on all sides.
Twenty-five girls of the Margaret 
Morrison and Arts Colleges aided 
the Staff in conducting the sales at 
Alumni luncheon. These girls are to 
be commended and thanked for their 
hearty co-operation in giving their 
services and their time for this pur
pose.
The bookB ordered by the Alumni 
will be mailed Boon so that their 
recipients will have plenty of time 
in which to brush up on their Carne

Glory of Carnegiebefore the 1924 
.football season rolls around.
Copies of tills second edition of 
tho Song Book are free from the 
several typographical errors of the 
first edition copies. A careful sur 
vey and scrutiny was given the en
tire contents in order to eliminate 
all errors.
The Otto Zimmerman Company of 
Cincinnati, Ohio, publishers of the 
first edition of tho Song Book, have 
been working overtime on' tho sec
ond edition, and wore able to send 
through two hundred and fifty books 
in time for Campus Week. These 
have all been sold to the Alumni.
In order to enable those students 
who failed to secure a copy'.of the 
Song Book during the first sales 
campaign in March, tho staff Is going 
to conduct another student sales 
campaign before Memorial Day. The 
book will bo hero In time for these 
sales and delivery will be made 
immediately upon the payment of 
tlio priceono dollar per copy.
Every student will thus bo en

share by knowing their cheers and 
songs, and giving thorn with that 
whole-hearted confidence* which 
comos from knowing how to receive 
victory and how to accept defeat.

DIRECTOR BREED 
DELIVERS ADDRESS
On American Association of 
University Women at 
Annual Banquet
Last Saturday evening the Com
mons was the scene of a wonderful 
reunion of students, and Alumnae at 
the Womens Banquet. The Alumnae 
present totalled 150, members of 
every class since 1909 being repre
sented.
Tables were resecved for the re
spective classes, at which the for
mer Arts and M. M. co-eds gathered 
and talked of old times, never to be 
forgotten.
Helen B. Johnston was toastmistress. A talk on Tech Spirit was 
given by Dean Brown. She spoke in 
an interesting manner on the manipu
lation and development of the spirit 
which has given Carnegie her name 
for better or for worse. Miss Brown 
dwelled particularly upon the develop
ment which she has witnessed during 
the past two years.
An address on "Then and Now, by 
Miss Millicent Leech, 15, was en
joyed alike by students and Alumnae 
alike. Some of the incidents related 
brought forth hearty laughs from the 
present students or "the Nows, as 
Miss Leech called them. She suc
ceeded in bringing home that, after 
all, the bonds which exist between 
the Thens and the Nows are so 
strong that it is difficult to distin
guish one from the other. 
Perhaps, the most interesting part 
of the program was the address by 
Miss Breed, on "The American As
sociation of University Women. Di
rector Breed related the arguments 
which had been presented against the 
admittance of alumnae of Carnegie 
to this association, and how.they had 
been overcome. During the last five 
years the Margaret Morrison director 
and others have been working very 
hard to gain admittance for Carnegie 
women. The goal is in sight now. It 
is up to tho alumnae to justify the ef
forts made in their behalf. No 
alumnae will pass up this proposition 
without giving it very serious con
sideration,, we feel sure. This is 
another step in the effort to make 
Carnegie known in her true light. 
Your help will be needed.

Civil Engineering is now usually 
considered to cover three related 
fieldsRailroading and Highway En
gineering (including Surveying and 
Geodesy), 1-Iydraullc and Sanitary 
Engineering and Structural Engi
neering.
The first deals with the location, 
construction and maintenance of rail
roads and highways; the second con
siders such subjects as canals, riv
ers, harbors, water-power, irrigation, 
water-supply, sewerage, drainage, 
sewage-disp'osal and purification of 
water; the third includes the design 
and construction of bridges, build
ings, dams, retaining walls, founda
tions, arches and culverts. City En
gineering, comprising many features 
of these fields, may be added to the 
above.
The Civil Engineering curriculum 
may be grouped under three import
ant heads. First, the fundamental 
subjects; second, the technical sub
jects; third, a background of cultural 
and business courses. The funda
mental subjects are Mathematics, 
Chemistry, Physics, English, Draw
ing and Mechanics; the technical 
subjects include, in part, Surveying, 
Curves and Earthwork, Railroad En
gineering, Highways, Materials, Hy
draulics, Water-Supply, Sewerage, 
Steel and Reinforced Concrete 
Structures. In addition to these, 
minor courses in Electrical and Me
chanical Engineering are required. 
The cultural and business courses in
clude Economics, Accounting, Con
tracts, Business Management, In
dustrial History and an elective.
The fundamental subjects form the 
foundation for all engineering 
courses. The technical subjects pro
vide a thorough grounding in the 
three fields of Civil Engineering, 
mentioned previously, and enable the 
student to enter any of these fields. 
If lie later plans to become a speci
alist, he should take a post-graduate 
course in his specialty.
While, in the past, the Civil En-. 
gineering graduate has confined him
self very closely, and perhaps too 
closely, to the more technical work, 
the trend at the present time for 
many is to broaden out and qualify 
for positions which are semi-busi
ness and semi-technical in character.
In order to better equip students for 
these positions, the business and 
cultural courses have been included 
in the curriculum.
The Civil Engineering graduate se
cures his first position, which is 
usually technical, because he is 
qualified to do a particular kind o 
technical work, but he does not 
necessarily have to continue in 
purely technical work, unless he de
sires. For example, one of of recent 
graduates, who has designed steel 
and concrete structures for a short 
time, is now offered an * opportunity 
to act as resident engineer on con
struction work. Civil engineers must 
not be considered only as designers. 
Among the graduates of this depart
ment are successful contractors, 
superintendents of construction, in
spectors, resident engineers, sales
men and district managers, as well 
as men who are engaged in the 
more technical phases of Civil En
gineering.
Civil Engineering, at least for the 
younger men, usually requires a 
great deal of work in the open, and 
is a healthful and pleasant occupa
tion for those who enjoy the out
doors.
From this discussion of the fields 
of Civil Engineering, it may be seen 
that the civil engineer is essentially 
a builder of works and usually has 
to deal with construction. It may be 
the building of a highway, the fur
nishing of a city with water, the de
veloping by irrigation of a desert in 
the West, the bridging or tunneling 
of a river, the improvement of the 
commerce of a port by the construc
tion of wharves or the dredging of 
the harbor, or the erection of a sky
scraper of steel or reinforced con
crete.

Thousands of students and teachers are sailing for Europe 
this summer in the third class cabins of United States Lines' 
ships. Separate exclusive space has been reserved on the
S. S. President Harding - June 24th 
S. S. Republic - - - July 2nd
S. S. Leviathan - July 5th
Similar reservations have been made on other eastbound 
ships and also on westbound ships (including the Leviathan) 
for your return.
College women are invited partic
ularly to make reservations on-the 
S. S. Republic sailing July 2 as 
special third cabin accommoda
tions are available under proper 
chaperonage. Women will also 
be especially chaperoned on the 
other ships listed above and on 
the return trips.
Third Class Cabin on United States 
Lines' Ships Is Not Steerage 
Third class cabins on these ships 
accommodate 2, 4 or 6 persons. 
They are clean, airy and comfort
able. The berths have soft, sani
tary mattresses and clean linen;
