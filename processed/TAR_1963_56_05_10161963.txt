Fall Festival is nine days from 
today, Friday, October 25, classes 
will recess at 12:30 for the week
end, which will swing through 
until 3 a.m. Sunday morning. The 
following schedule of events has 
been organized for the weekend:
The first activity to open the 
weekend will begin at 1 p.m. Fri
day with the intramural football 
championship games at the intra
mural .field. Then from 3 until 5 
p.m. students will have a chance 
to see a Panhellenic skit and at
tend a jam session in the Skibo 
ballroom. Panhel, Council of Fra
ternity Presidents, and Mens 
Dormitory Council are sponsoring 
the session.
Starting at 7:15 that evening 
a torchlight parade will be taken 
to the football field for the crown
ing of this years Festival queen, 
fraternity pledge class cheers, 
pep rally, and honorary calls.
Immediately after, a Hoote
nanny wil begin in the gym. Bud

climaxed Saturday night with a 
dance in the Skibo ballroom at 9

Pan-Hel Plans 
Lively Skit
Once again the Panhellenic 
Council is joining in and adding 
to the festivities of the Fall week
end on October 25-26. In keeping 
with the tradition that was begun 
last year, all of Techs seven 
sororities are joining together to 
present a bigger and better PanHel skit. Up until last year, each 
sorority presented its own skit, 
the driving force being competi
tion rather than co-operation. Al
though the plans are still tenta
tive, this years skit is scheduled 
to go on during the intermission 
of the jam session, which is to be 
co-sponsored by Pan-Hel, C. F. P., 
and the Mens and Womens Dorm 
Councils. All of this activity will 
take place on Friday afternoon, 
October 25, in the Skibo Ballroom.
Adina Rosenfeld, Alpha Epsi
lon Phi, has been chosen director, 
and Gail Drake, Delta Delta 
Delta, is in charge of props. There 
are also seven writers, one from 
each sorority, and these include 
Bonnie Kliot, Alpha Epsilon Phi; 
Pam Mayer, Chi Omega; Karen 
Smith, Delta Delta Delta; Diane 
Brown, Delta Gamma; Nancy 
Jenks, Kappa Alpha Theta; Jane 
Simson, Kappa Kappa Gamma; 
and Carole Brewer, Sigma Kappa. 
Each sorority has one representa
tive to work on costumes, and 
each will send three representa
tives to perform. Although plans 
are still indefinite, the skit prom
ises to be an enjoyable affair.

On Monday, October 7, $1200 
worth of photographic equip
ment was stolen from the Car
negie Tech yearbook office. Most 
of the equipment was owned by 
the photo editor, some by the 
Tartan. The loss, however, was 
not confirmed until Friday of that 
week.
The events which led to the 
discovery of the theft began af
ter a Thistle staff meeting on 
Monday evening.
Tuesday at noon, Thistle edi
tor, Tod Johnson had difficulty 
fitting his key in the cupboard 
lock in the yearbook office. As
suming that the photo editor had 
changed the lock, he thought 
nothing more of it until he re
ceived a call the following day 
from Jim Pawley, the photo edi
tor, Jim, too, had trouble with 
the lock and similarly thought 
that Tod had changed the lock.
Since neither of them knew of 
no change in the lock, they merely 
suspected that the*" lock had 
jammed. They forwarded a note 
to Dean Strick to have a main
tenance man remove the lock. The 
lock was sent to Dean Stricks 
office.
Thursday night, when Jim re
turned to the Thistle office, he 
found that most of the photo
graphic equipment was gone. His 
first thought was that another 
staff member had replaced the 
equipment for safe-keeping, as 
there was no lock on the cabinet. 
No one had any information to 
support his belief.
Friday morning, upon question
ing the janitor, Jim learned that 
nothing in the cabinet had been 
touched since the lock was re
moved. Under these circum
stances, it became evident that 
between the time of the meeting 
on Monday evening and Tues
day noon, the $1,200 worth of 
equipment had been stolen.
It was presumed that the door 
and cupboard locks had been 
picked and that the burglar had 
substituted a new lock on the 
cupboard, which was confirmed

Hootenanny 
Gives Guitar 
As Door Prize
Watch for a special gimic with 
Fall Festivals Friday night Hoot
enanny. Besides seeing Bud and 
Travis and Judy Henske, students 
will have a chance to win a guitar.
The instrument, donated by the 
Goya Guitar Company, will be 
given as a door prize to the stu
dent who holds the ticket stub 
bearing a number drawn at ran
dom by Judy Henske during the] 
performance. The guitar is a 
Greco model, six string classical) 
instrument, valued at eighty dol

Only those students who attend 
the Hootenanny will be eligible to 
win the instrument.
by the difficulty that the two edi
tors encountered.
Dr. Ellis, Dean of Men, and 
Mr. Young, Supervisor of the 
Security Office, were immediately 
consulted by Jim Pawley when 
ht discovered that the lock in 
Dean Stricks office was not the 
one that he had installed.
Later that day, upon Mr. 
Youngs suggestion, the Pittsburgh 
Police were called to the school. 
Detectives recorded descriptions
of the stolen articles, which wer 
verified through serial number 
obtained from Jims home if* 
Ben Lomond, California.
Some of the items stolen were: 
a Rolliflex 3.5 Camera ($300), a 
Nikon F Reflex Camera ($200). a

Press Man Addresses 
Tuesday Assembly
The Tech assembly program re
turns on Oct. 22 to the Wherrett 
Lounge with speaker Derek Prag. 
Mr. Prag is Chief of Publica
tions for the Press and Informa
tion Service and European Com
munities including the Common 
Market and Euratom. Mr. Prag, 
one of the few British members 
of the European Communities 
executive staff, will give his per
sonal views on the future course 
of European unity and on the 
events of the past few months, 
 including the suspension of ne
gotiations for British membership 
in the EEC and General de 
Gaulles policies toward European 
* integration and nuclear weapons.
An economist and journalist, 
Mr. Prag has been an official of 
European Communities since 1955. 
In his present position, he is re
sponsible for all information 
publications of the Common Mar
ket, Coal and Steel Community, 
and Euratom. Mr. Prag was born 
in 1923 in South Wales. He was 
a scholar in residence at Eman0 ual College, Cambridge, in 1941- 
42 and studied Slavonic langu
ages and history at London Uni
versity in 1942-43. From 1943-47, 
Mr. Prag was a British intelli
gence officer on active service in 
Egypt, Italy, and Austria. In 
1947, he returned to Cambridge. 
He received his bachelors degree 
in modern languages and eco
nomics the following year. He 
has since received a masters de& gree from Cambridge. From 1950- 
55, Mr. Prag was a correspon
dent and editor for Reuters News 
Agency in London, Brussels and 
Madrid, specializing in interna
tional and European organiza
tions. In 1955, he joined the In
formation Service of the Euro

sels. He speaks seven languages, 
including fluent French, German, 
Spanish, and Italian.

Benny Fiddles 
For Symphony 
^ At Benefit
Pittsburgh (Oct. 11)  The 
three Bs of music traditionally 
are Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms. 
Now, the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra has altered tradition to 
suit its own purposes for concerts 
planned in the next fe wweeks. 
For this weekend and Monday, 
November 4 at Syria Mosque, the 
phrase should read: The, Five 
Bs  Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, 
V Barenboim, and Benny.
Daniel Barenboim, the sensa
tional young Israel pianist ap
pears at Syria Mosque this week
end with William Steinberg and 
the Pittsburgh Symbhony Orches
tra. He will perform on programs 
of music written by Bach, Beetho
ven, and Brahms. Barenboim will 
play Beethovens exciting Emporor Concerto. So much for four 
of the five Bs.
Jl The fifth B naturally refers to 
Jack Benny who comes to Syria 
Mosque Monday evening, Novem
ber 4 to perform with William 
Steinberg and the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Benny 
will not play the music of Bach, 
Beethoven or Brahms. In fact, it 
hardly matters what he will play 
although the expected capacity 
audience probably will be sur
prised to find that Mr. Benny does 
right well with the music of Men
delssohn.
Bennys appearance in Pitts
burgh November 4 is the high
light of the current Pittsburgh 
Symphony season. The special 
concert will benefit the Pension 
and Symphony funds of the or
chestra. Mr. Benny, William 
Steinberg and the entire orchestra 
are donating their services for 
the event.

Tech Internationals 
Hunt Ideas, Friends
Todays schools and youth are 
the highest hope of international 
understanding. They alone can 
banish the prejudices that pro
duce dissension between people. 
They have declared a justified 
war against ignorance because it 
is the chief cause of blunders. You 
cannot assume a stand without 
examining the cituation, and you 
will never know a nation unless 
you know its people. Your ideas 
are worthless until you find some
one to discuss them with.
There are millions of people on 
this earth and many nations. Our 
world is becoming so small now, 
that the understanding of all 
these people is becoming an es
sential part of our lives. For all 
these reasons the International 
Club of Carnegie Tech was 
founded. Through its discussions, 
it hopes to achieve a mutual un
derstanding. The topics may vary 
from international and domestic 
relations to problems such as the 
influence of women, if any, on 
the society. Newspaper inter
views and TV debates serve as 
a means to express our views 
through a different medium. As 
a member of the Collegiate Coun
cil for the UN, the club is rep
resented in many sessions 
throughout the U.S. In Canada 
our role is apparent in the sense 
that the assembly passed all the 
resolutions recommended by the 
clubs delegate. And for the first 
time an Institute of Technology 
is represented by four indepen
dent delegates working in a field 
which is not of the field of their
studies. Through the P. C.I. V, 
F. P. A. or other similar organi
zations, the club is utilizing an
other media of communication.
Social activities are considered 
of vital importance. They supply 
the light touch to the more soi ber purposes of the club. The 
WINE and CHEESE parties,
; which are defined as American 
mixers in the international man; ner, the Mardi Gras, and the 
I Annual Ball are different sides 
! of these activities. On the other 
hand, there is a soccer and a 
; cricket team, but the footbnll 
team is unfortunately under
staffed.|
We have come to meet on this 
campus, not only from many dif
ferent countries, but also from 
; all over the United States. We 
like to think of ourselves a 
friends who are fortunate in hav
ing this chance to win the bat
tle against ignorance. As the 
French say, Look around and 
you may find a woman or an 
idea. They both are worth objserving.

Heavens Above Comes Falling Down
by Stillwater Pierce
(Editors Note: This marks the first airing 
of a weekly column devoted to reviewing 
current cinema at near-by movie houses. 
Seated at the critic's desk is Mr. Stillwater 
Pierce, who recently journeyed here from 
England where he studied film-techniques at 
the London School of Cinematrophy. Mr. 
Pierce has himself been responsible for 
eleven feature movies, among them 6V4, 
Cleopatricia Meets The Invisible Man and 
the award-winning documentary. Go Home. 
Yankee, The Ballgames Over! No stranger, 
then, to the wiles of filmland, Mr. Pierce 
bases his ratings on the four-point grade sys
tem. Comments on his reviews are welcomed 
though unanticipated).
Heavens Above 
(Shadyside Theatre on Walnut Street: show
ings at 7:35 and 9:50 p.m.)
Hating: 2.0
In Heavens Above Englands famous Boul
ting Brothers take on the Anglican Church 
and wind up somewhat the worse for their 
attempt. Peter Sellers is cast as a naive 
idealistic vicar who, though an imbroglio of 
mixed identity, assumes leadership over a 
small rural parish. The towns people owe 
their livlihood to a factory manufacturing 
tranquilizers, now under the control of one 
exceedingly rich, God-indifferent widow and 
her son. The plot is more than a little cliched: Sellers goes to the town, preaches the 
Bible in earnest, stimulates no-one into salva
tion from their material concerns until, per
chance, the widow descends her lofty man
sion, meets the vicar and is instantly spur
red into more heavenly pursuits. She bands 
with him to spread the wealth, under the 
name of Christianity, and in the course of
rn5tWe5IH
their do-gooding they manage to almost de
stroy the town and John Bull himself.
Sellers occasionally plays the vicar, but 
only when he stops playing himself, which 
is quite frequently. Better is Isabel Jeans as 
the widow and Cecil Parker as the Archduke. 
Still, even superlative acting would not turn 
this essentially tasteless satire into a truly 
humorous movie. The Boultings have set 
themselves to easy a task; even a dolt can 
sense a certain hypocrisy among the clergy; 
it takes little artisty to mock do-gooder; the 
stinking rich have been satirized so often by 
now that if we saw an honest portrayal of 
their society we would probably lable it false.
In short, even target of disparagement in 
Heavens Above has already been worked to 
death. .The Boultings might have salvaged 
their enterprise, of course, were they able 
to instill the movie with fresh comic situa
tions and characters. But instead we get a 
vicious scorn no more subtle in excution than 
the cry of a mating Elk. A few nice lines 
(Doctor to Archduke: Yes, you have many 
psychologically abnormal people in your pro
fession, but somehow most of them wind up 
as saints) and a few funny bits, but not 
much else.
Just as in the Boultings Im Allright, 
Jack, which was a satirical re-working of an
other serious English firm, The Angry 
Silence, Heavens Above seems to draw its 
basic idea from a serious movie treatment of 
the same themenamely Bunuels Viridiana. 
We have, for instance, a full ensemble of 
heathen derelects who take advantage of the 
vicars idealism and other items recalling the 
Buuel masterpiece. But in its pervasive 
vulgarity Heavens Above stands quite apart, 
a wart unto itself.
Carnegie Dust Bowl
The male students of Carnegie Tech are very fortunate 
to have such a fine intramural athletic program at their dis
posal. Twenty-two different sports provide enough variety 
that anyone, no matter what his athletic ability, can find 
competition on his individual level of play. This is evidenced 
Techs men participate in intra-^
murals. The program is very wellorganized and runs smoothly by 
the Deparement of Intramural 
Athletics, the Intramural Board, 
and the Managers Club. The suc
cess of this program has induced 
many schools to contact E. L. 
Boyer of the Intramural Depart
ment to determine how various 
aspects of Techs program could 
be incorporated into their setup.
Yet m spite of this success, in 
spite of the large percentage of 
participating students, and in 
spite of the five overall organiza
tions, there is one thing that 
threatens to severely limit, if not 
ruin Techs program. This is the 
lack of a decent outdoor playing 
field.
The facility presently being 
used is the area located just above 
the TECH bowl. This dust bowl 
cannot be described as a playing 
field. A better description would 
be a hard, uncared for open area 
that has been designated as the 
location for all outdoor intra
mural sports.
The ground has been baked 
brick-hard by a dry summer and 
fall. What grass there is has been 
completely dried up, leaving the 
field half covered with parched 
patches of grass and the other 
half covered with a thick layer of 
dust, that sends football players 
back to the showers looking like 
coal miners. Small rocks are scat
tered over both football fields.

They had a mass meeting of the large night class and Dr. Hamerschlag addressed them. Among other things, he 
stressed the difficulties some of them had in managing to 
attend. Two of them he mentioned were 10 to 13 hour days 
and 7 day weeks. That was only fifty years ago. Further he 
mentioned that Tech was a leader in this sort of work. It 
would appear that the present day Carnegie has gone a 
little backward on this seore. Indeed, if the modern uni
versity is to be a large factory, where one enters, then chugchug-chug-think-think-think-work-work-work, then leaves 
with a grey flannel cap and gown plus a brand-new plastic 
diploma, the diminishing night school which would insure 
round the clock production is a retrogressive movement. 
The modern university could also have periods set aside for 
people to meet and to try to influence one another as best they can according to the iron clad rules of human engineer
ing. Tech overcame Waynesburg 18 to 0, and the Tartan 
included sketches of how each of the touchdowns was made. 
A person advertised as Sailor the Tailor; he worked at the Peoples Bank Building at the corner of Wood and 4th avenue. For those who wanted to go out, there was at the Grand Opera House an act which featured the telegraphic power of Mercedes and Mile Stantone. Also on the bill was an elaborate one act play.
There are holes from last years 
softball season and several stakes 
left protruding about an inch 
above the ground.
This field is not potentially 
dangerous. It is dangerous. Many 
Tech students, including this edi
tor, still bear scars and marks 
from sliding on these fields last 
softball season. Football and soc
cer games, in which falls are in
evitable, are sure to produce 
more cuts and abrasions than 
softball, especially now that the 
fields have had the entire summer 
to dry and bake hard. Any player 
who leaves his feet stands a good 
chance of leaving some of his skin 
on the field. If someone could fall 
and hit one of the protruding 
stakes, an unnecessity, serious in
jury could result.
Late in August, the Pittsburgh 
Steelers scheduled two practices 
on this field. However, when the 
coaching staff saw the condition 
of the field, they refused to allow 
the team to practice there, even in 
pads, saying it was too dangerous. 
The Steelers would not practice 
here in pads, but Techs students 
are expected to play on this field 
without the benefit of any padding 
at all.
The Intramural Department 
does everything in its power to 
safeguard the health of partici
pants. All players must wear high 
top shoes and carry insurance. In 
football, three officials are pro
vided to eliminate rough or dirty 
play. But nothing can be done 
about an inadequate playing field 
that makes injuries inevitable.
Something must be done now or 
the field will soon deteriorate to 
the point that they will be com
pletely unsuitable for outdoor 
sports. That something is obvious. 
The present field must be reseed
ed. Then it must be cared for and 
watered so that it will not again 
deteriorate to its present condi
tion.
This could be done without dis
rupting any of the activities that 
go on in the intramural area. The 
intramural field is not limited to 
intramurals alone. The football 
team, the physical education 
classes, ROTC, and the band all 
use this field for drill and prac
tice. If some of these activities 
could be transferred to other open

Food For Thoughtc?
Many criticisms have been leveled against Stouffers for 
their operation of Skibo. But perhaps that is not what should 
be done. After all, Stouffers is not concerned about students. 
Why should they be? They will serve the food, and the stu
dents will eat it whether they like it or not. The criticisms 
should -be directed to the administration. (Although the 
powers that be are aware of what is thought of Skibos 
food, they have never condescended to reply to any of the 
many criticisms.)
Perhaps the problem is that the administration does not 
know what to do. In case of this eventuality, a workable 
practical plan will now be presented. This plan will elimin
ate the present method (hoping that changes will occur if 
sufficient complaints are heard) in favor of an automatic 
and considerably more responsive mechanism.
Simply, the plan is to lease out the schools equipment 
and space in each of the cafeterias and snack bars separate
ly. These leases would go to the highest bidderexcept that 
no firm would be allowed to operate more than one cafeteria. 
Thus each side of Skibos cafeteria would be operated by a 
separate firm and the snack bar by still another firm. Per
haps Morewood Gardens could participate in this plan too, 
although the administration may have reasons (not good 
onesbut thats another column) for keeping the sexes seg
regated. Minimal standards and regulations could be placed 
in the leases before the bidding begins. It is hard to see 
how such a system would be worse than what now exists.
And the possibilities for improvement are enormous. 
Students would have several choices instead of one  the 
fortunes of each establishment would vary with the student 
bodys opinion. If the Economics courses taught at Tech 
(and the book written by a Tech professor) are to be be
lieved, the establishment of competition would hasten inno
vations, tend to maximize value received for money, and 
give students what they want (within the limits of what 
they are willing to pay).
Even if every cafeteria were owned by a separate firm, 
perfect competition would not exist. But at least there would 
be alternatives to Stouffers, and the managements of the 
cafeterias would have to be more responsive than the pres
ent management (that is if the aim of the companies is 
making money).
G. L. Bach has written . . . it is the customer who is 
willing and able to buy who directs production in a priv
ate-enterprise economy. Would this not be better than hav
ing Stouffers (or anyone) choose what to serve?

Over fifty Tech students from 
all three colleges have volunteered 
an hour and a half of their time 
once a week to tutor elementary 
Ifend high school students on the 
North Side, a slum area across 
the river from Gateway Center. 
They will tutor in all high school 
subjects and in primary reading 
and arithmetic.
The project began this summer 
and many of the students who 
were tutored arecoming back. 
Carnell, a hard-core 12 year 
^>ld, wants to be tutored again and 
^vants more and more of his 
friends to be in the program. Vin
cent, one of eight brothers, wants 
to be tutored because, its fun. 
and he liked his tutor. Anna Mae 
enjoyed acting, as did Raymond, 
who was tutored at the same time. 
All of these children come from 
one of the most crowded schools 
on the North Side  and 
and  many other students, this 
summer was the first time that 
Someone really cared about what 
they did, what they wanted to do, 
and what happened to them. Two 
chronic truants came twice a week 
for eight weeks, not missing a 
session. Many went to a farm 
want to go back; several got 
brary cards and proudly display 
them, simple, common-place ev
ents for a middle class child  
not so for those in the North 
Tutorial Project.
^ Each tutor will have two stu
dents and will meet with them 
church, community center, or 
school any afternoon or evening 
during the week or anytime on 
Saturday. There is no plan that 
the tutors must folow, but they 
are left to decide what would be 
most beneficial for their students.
If anyone is interested in the 
program or has any questions,

areas on campus, the intramural 
program could be limited to half 
the playing area while the other 
half is being reseeded.
By other open areas I mean 
the cut, the mall, and the Tech 
Bowl. It seems that the admini
stration regards these well-water
ed grassy areas as green emeralds, 
only to be looked upon but not 
trod upon. If these could be 
opened up for such things as 
ROTC drill, womens field hockey, 
and marching band practice, the 
problem would be solved. The 
football team could practice in the 
bowl, the physical education de
partment and the intramural de
partment could manage using half 
the field, and the other half could 
be repaired and reseeded.
The only objection to this pro
posal would seem to be that by 
utilizing the cut, the mall, and 
the bowl, these green areas would 
be torn up, detracting from the 
beauty of Techs campus. How
ever, with all the space available 
next to Skibo, in front of the Fine 
Arts Building, and between Ad
ministration and Engineering 
Halls, and the few activities that 
need this space, it doesnt seem 
likely that one or two hours of 
use a week would leave any mark 
at all.
Something must be done now, 
for if the field is allowed to de
teriorate much farther it will be 
useless for any activity. Then 
what will the administration do 
with the varsity football team, 
ROTC, the intramural teams, and 
the physical education classes? It 
will either have to allow them to 
use the cut, the mall, and the 
bowl, or it will have to discon
tinue these activities completely. 
The question, therefore, is not IF, 
but WHEN will the intramural 
field be repaired.

The International Students 
Committee has extended invita
tions to all campuses in Pitts

the INTERNATIONAL WEEK 
will provide the students of the 
different campuses with an excel

thus prepare the ground for bet
ter understanding and co-opera
tion between them.
To establish better communica
tions among the student commu
nities of the different campuses 
and to foster mutual cooperation 
among them, is only one of the 
objectives of the INTERNATION
AL WEEK. The other aim, equal
ly important, is to bring together 
the foreign scholar and his Amer
ican host. Recently Pittsburgh has 
become a very important center 
of cultural and educational ex
change for men and women from 
all over the world. The University 
of Pittsburgh alone has over 350 
scholars and students from more 
than 70 different countries. The 
INTERNATIONAL WEEK has 
been planned to create an aware
ness among the people of Pitts
burgh about the increasingly im
portant role which the city is 
playing as an educational center 
of the world. The committee is co
operating with voluntary organi
zations like the P. C. I. V., the 
Y. M. and Y. W. C. A., nad other 
similar agencies to promote and 
exchange good will and ideas be
tween people of different cultural 
backgrounds.
Terrorize Tech Campus
By Chris Makosco
At Cal Tech overworked undergrads release tensions 
smashing pianos, at Princeton they march down the main 
street, but several freshmen at Carnegie have found a new 
way to vent their emotions. When Wenoos chemistry lectures 
and Western Civ Tacitus assignments become too much, 
these youths release pent-up# 
shaving cream from aeresol cans.
Friday morning at about one 
oclock a dozen dark forms crept 
stealthily across the Skibo park
ing lot toward the Forbes Ave
nue fraternity row. They wore 
black windbreakers and sneakers 
for disguise and silence. Several 
had even blackened their faces 
with grease paint like Marine 
Commandos. All were heavily 
armed.
The week before ATOs, Betas,
DUs, Kappa Sigs and TXs had 
awakened to shaving cream greet
ings inscribed on their walls and 
windows. On Thursday astute 
psychologists among the Greeks 
accurately predicted that this 
again would be a good night for 
the release of shaving cream 
emotions. All the victims of the 
previous week were duly warned.
A brilliant idea of hanging lan
terns from the roof of Skibo 
(one if by the cut, two if by 
Forbes) failed to pan out.
Shortly oefore 1:00 a.m., several 
Betas, having finished their home
work, shipped out into the Skibo 
lot to catch the Burmashave Ban
dits from the rear. The alert 
Kappa Sigs, keeping vigil from 
their hill, spotted the Betas and 
zealously mistook them for the 
Rapidshave raiders. Several of 
their Pershing Rifle brothers led 
a brilliant charge which syept 
down over Forbes into the park
ing lot. This set off similar le
gions from Beta and DU. TX, 
led by their valient boxer, Duke, 
swung across Forbes into the 
thick of the battle. General von 
Twistern closed the right flank 
with the ATO division.
At the opposite end of the lot,
12 glisten-eyed, besmudged faces 
dropped in amazement as they 
saw the welcome party streaming 
to greet them. Sweaty hands 
dropped cans of Gillette Foamy 
and psychological problems with 
C705 were quickly released with 
tensions being channelled into 
swiftly running legs. With their 
headstarts 11 made it back to base 
camp. But fleet-footed forward 
Sam Cupps managed to run down 
one unfortunate raider. A hoarse
cheer went Up in 200 throats. The 
shame-faced youth was brought 
to justice.
After serious deliberation, court 
passed sentence and a pajamaclad barber emerged from the 
Beta crew, clippers in hand. The 
Beta barber managed to fash
ion the freshmans head into a 
resemblance of a pious Franciscan 
monk. He was given a crown of 
shaving cream and TXs Duke 
kissed the little bandit good night. 
He left penitently vowing to study 
hard the rest of the evening.
Just like the U.S. Cavalry, the 
rent-a-cops arrived as the fra
ternity men were heading for 
bed. One retiring bystande/ in
nocently informed the officers he 
was counting trolleys. A Boss 
Hall dorm counselor, Mike Echols, 
making sure his boys were ali 
tucked in bed, pointed out several 
constellations to the officers.
The next afternoon the smooth
faced (and scalped) raider, doning a freshman dink, returned to 
apoligize to the fraternities con
cerned. He thanked them for the 
free haircut and they, in turn, 
wished him the best of luck on 
mid-term exams.
We all make mistakes...

Your Man 
In Congress
Margaret Morrison St, Wilson Grantsn , . n . . . , AvailableParking Restricted
Octobers Happy Congress was one of the most optimis
tic meetings in this writers memory; it ended not with a 
whimper, but with a bang, or perhaps we should say a Cock|fr-doodle-doo! Anyone questioning this should take a look 
at the agenda. The minutes of Executive Council were read 
as the first order of business; and^
Patterns has been give one more 
year of grace. Patterns is a phe
nomena almost as incongruous on 
this campus as our very conserva
tive fine arts students in the ultra
modern setting of the Fine Arts 
Building. That the only all-cam
pus literary-arts magazine should 
be so poor  and so small 
^hould be a shock to anyone who 
can see the tremendous talent on 
this campus. But that year after 
year it has no sales manager, no 
sales campaign and no profit, is a 
crime. Congress seems to be try
ing to give it a sort of extreme 
unction transfusion  a stay of 
execution for the eleventh hour.
Let us hope that it works.
One does not need to look far 
to find a similar situation. Carjiegie Techs Radio Station, WRCT,
 rvides a great many invaluable 
services that no one appreciates, 
and some very good programming 
to which no one listens. When 
WRCT does make its presence 
known, as it will very soon, this 
situation may be remedied. But 
when it must go to congress to col
lect money promised to it last 
Spring for technical servicesand 
must account to Congress for each 
^item in its Fall Festival Bill, which 
t$s mandatory to the fuctioning of 
Fall Festival, something is wrong.
If Congress represents the school, 
i.e. the 750 fellows who will actu
ally lay down 5 of their hardearned dollars for a ticket to Fall 
weekend, surely it will do every
thing possible to assure its success.
The second item on the Execu
tive Council Minutes was the Fall 
Festival Budget, in which this 
extra $200 for WRCT was contest
ed. Any students interested in the 
economics of entertainment on a 
semi-grand scale would do well to 
look at this budget. The amount 
for taxes alone is somewhat 
frightening.
Committee Reports this week 
included urgent reminders from 
Activities Committee to register 
your activity as active, or it wont 
be; Fall Festival announced its 
previews of coming attractions,
^ind Rules Committee laid down 
its rules for absenteeism of mem
bers. This last has existed as a 
problem since 1000 A.D.. so its 
rather doubtful that our rules 
committee will be able to solve it; 
but one thing Student Congress 
does is try.
The Congress unanimously de
clared the Cameron Choir Concert 
January 10 an all school event, 
which means that no house par
ities may be given at the same 
xime; fortunately, the weekend is 
the one before finals, and no one 
will be at any house parties any
way. Why, then, did Congress do 
this? Probably from a genuine at
tempt to support CITs all-department chorus. I am sure the choir 
appreciates its new status, but it 
is observable that the concerts
The traffic division of the Pittsburgh Police Department 
last week declared it illegal for cars to be parked on the 
north curb side of Margaret Morrison Street between the 
driveway at the Home Economics House and the Fine Arts 
parking lot. ? 
given off-campus, more than twice 
as many as are given in the Ball
room, draw much larger crowds 
than those given here. This is a 
situation Congress can do little 
to remedy.
The motion for all-campus 
election of Congress lingers on, 
making characteristic noises, 
which may become coherent and 
will certainly be significant, for 
this Thursday 17th there will be 
an open meeting in Skibo Room 56 
at 4:30 to hear student views. In
terested people should see Bob 
Hawkins.
Give thanks unto Roger Powell, 
for lo, he has seen the unrest of 
the miserable people of CIT, and 
his soul was moved to pity them. 
And from the General Campus 
committee he called together the 
Chief Priests and Scribes and said, 
Well, it seems that its an awful 
long time between September 18 
and Christmas. I sort of feel that 
the Marginal Efficiency of classes 
on the Friday after Thanksgiving 
will be lower than usual. Lets 
ask the administration to reinstate 
Friday as part of the vacation in 
1964 period. And the Chief 
Priests and the Scribes rose from 
their seats in great astonishment, 
and pondered long, for such an 
idea had not occurred to them. 
They searched their hearts and 
meditated at great length; and 
after an hour, lo, they rose as one 
man and cried upon the name of 
Jack Turk, General Campus com
mittee chairman, and said, Let it 
be done. And it was so.
And the members of the Gen
eral Campus Committee took their 
record books, and went out among 
the common people, to ask them if 
they would care to comment. And 
this day was the day which is 
called Friday, November 29, in 
your land. And lo, there were 
none, all had departed to their 
homes; and the administration 
wept, and donned sackcloth and 
ashes, and there was gnashing of 
teeth all over the campus.
The meeting was adjourned.
 M. H.
The No Parking signs were in
stalled a week ago yesterday, 
October 9, by the traffic division, 
and the action was immediately 
followed by a communication 
from Dean Brown that the school 
was in accord with the new regu
lation. The message from Dean 
Brown served as a warning to 
those who drive to school, because 
no announcement had preceded 
the installation of the new signs. 
Violators of the new regulation, 
however, will not be prosecuted 
until Thursday morning, October 
18. This was arranged by Mr. 
Young, Supervisor of the Car
negie Tech Security Office, so stu
dents could have the opportunity 
of acquainting themselves with 
the circumstances which led to 
this action.
PART OF OAKLAND PROJECT
It was learned from Mr. Young 
that the move was motivated by 
the recently announced policy of 
meter installation in Schenley 
Plaza at Carnegie Library, an
other step in the over-all Oak
land Redevelopment Project.
Although the Pittsburgh Police 
had not informed the school as to 
when the signs would be installed, 
Carnegie Tech had been consulted 
prior to the action. The school 
based its support on several rea! sons.
First, parking on the inside 
curve of Margaret Morrison Street 
poses a tremendous visibility haz
ard. Secondly, with parking at the 
entrance to Donner Hall (consid
ered by local laws to be a load
ing zone), two lanes of obstructing 
traffic are necessitated for the 
function of both parking and load
ing operations. The third reason 
is that the area has a heavy 
pedestrian flow with three major 
crosswalks serving eight residen
tial buildings.
The new regulation allows for 
maximum visibility, safe pedes
trian flow, and expedient, uncom
plicated service for Donner Hall.
The total number of parking
spaces affected by the new re
striction is 18. There has been no 
change to Frew Street parking 
regulations.
Nominations for the 1964 - 65 
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships will 
be made by individual members 
of the Carnegie Tech faculty dur
ing the month of October.
Seniors of outstanding prom.se 
interested in college teaching as 
a career are eligible for nomina
tion. The awards, primarily f<ur 
students in the humanities and 
social sciences, are also granted 
to majors in art history, music
ology and music composition. 
Science and mathematics majorsACTION BY THE CITY
It was further emphasized by pianning on college teaching may

IM Football Season Nears Close
As the intramural football season draws to a close for the 
fall of 1963, and the all-important play-offs become the sub
ject of campus conversation once again, the two teams most 
frequently discussed around the Skibo snack bar and frater
nity dining halls are Alpha Tau Omega and the Grand Eagles. 
The question uppermost in thee-;-------------------------------------------------------
minds of most observers is 
whether the depth and balance of 
a well-drilled ATO team will 
match the hulking size of the 
well-epxerienced grads when the 
long-awaited clash occurs.
In league play this week, ATO 
sewed up the title in the Eagles 
league by whipping the Trojans 
37-14 and the Marauders 48-7. 
Five different Taus scored against 
the Trojans, but the play of the 
day occurred on a touchdown 
pass to center Tom Huhn when 
the Trojans had everybody else 
covered, including one referee. 
The battle for second place in 
this league seems to be the issue 
in doubt. The Grads B nipped 
the Marauders 8-6, the Marauders 
turned around and beat the Tro
jans 10-7, and then the Trojans 
surprised everybodys by beating 
the Grads B 18-11, as John 
Regan caught 3 TD passes from 
Jerry Meier. All three teams end
ed league play with identical 2-2 
records, and a play-off will be 
necessary to determine second 
place. The Kappa Sigs found this 
league a little on the tough side 
as they dropped one to the Tro
jans 22-9, and one to the Ma
rauders 18-16.
In the Steelers league the Grad 
Eagles A dominated everything. 
With a roster including such var
ied personalities as rookie Howie
SAE 18-7. SAE, meanwhile, vir
tually clinched ssecond place by 
beating DTD 25-12. The Delts as
sured themselves of a third place 
finish by whipping the Dunkers 
37-23, and the Beta B team 40- 
27 on the strength of four touch
downs by Jay Early. ATO B 
put themselves in the win column 
by beating the Dunkers 25-13, but 
found BTP B a little stronger 
and lost a 25-17 decision.
The big game in the Browns 
league was BTP A vs. DU with 
first place at stake. At the end 
of the first quarter the Betas held 
an 11-1 lead, and they protected 
it the rest of the way to claim 
a 1918 victory. DU then clinched 
second place by beating the 
Whales 27-16 behind Pavlik and 
Kosko, and followed this one up 
by trimming PKT 35-16 as Bill 
Crookston scored four touch
downs. The under-manned Phi 
Kaps finally got into the victory 
column with an 11-1 decision over 
the Browns.
In the Giants league the spot
light focused on the Sunday af
ternoon clash between unbeaten 
Sigma Nu, and top-ranked TDP. 
The Tau Delts hit paydirt in the 
opening minutes on an end run 
by Karl Schneider, but Sigma Nu 
stormed back for a first-down 
and then put five more ponts on 
the scoreboard on a Blue to 
Pifer (4 years of I.M. experience) I VandeLinde pass. Except for a first 
and Fred Kosofsky (n-factoriali down by Sigma Nu. the middle 
years of I.M. experience), they i quarters were all defense, and 
rolled over the Dunkers 29-0 and \ going into the final quarter it
was still anyone's game. Then 
Blue began to click on the long 
ones and, after a first-down, hit 
Logan for the score. The Tau 
Delts came back to tally in the 
closing seconds, but when time 
ran out Sigma Nu had a 13-11 
victory and first place in the Gi
ants League. The Finks B vir
tually clinched second place with 
a 17-12 win over TDP, and a 13- 
10 victory over BSR. The Dorms 
whipped Theta Xi 30-11, but lost 
to the Tau Delts 16-7 and to Sigma 
Nu 28-4 as Lagon scored three 
times for Sigma Nu in that one. 
BSR dropped one to the Tau Delts 
16-8, and one to Sigma Nu 12-10, 
while Sigma Nus final victory of 
the week came against an under
manned TX team 28-12. Second 
place in this league will be de
cided when the Finks B face 
the Dorms. Should the Finks lose, 
a three way tie will develop 
among the Dorms, the Finks, and 
TDP, but a victory, as expected, 
will put them into the play-offs.

Techs cross - country teams 
swift spikes cut down Grove City 
21-38 and Stubenville 15-50 in a 
double dual meet Saturday morn
ing on Flagstaff Hill. The Tartan 
harriers led again by freshman 
Harry Burkholder scampered over 
the hilly Schenley course to their 
twelfth straight victory.
Burkholder loped down to the 
finish opposite Administration 
in 23 minutes 52 seconds. 
Sophomore Chris Macosko in a 
half minute behind with two 
Grovers, Doug Logan and Jim 
Shaver, panting at his heels. The 
home fans cheered as four Tech 
runners then crossed the finish 
line in quick succession, taking 
fifth through eight places. The 
consistant Tech combination of 
front strength and solid depth 
again proved unbeatable.
Little Mike Engle, a 5-ft-6-in. 
freshman, finished strong, taking 
three sport senior Andy Niedra, 
for fifth. Right behind were 
6-ft.-6-in. senior Tom Bednarz 
and junior George Crawford. Paul 
Fackler, Ken Phillips, and Herb 
D'Alo swiped eleventh, thirteenth 
and fifteenth from Grove City. 
At the back of the pack fresh
man Chuck Bounds, Dave Simon 
and junior Don Stockard ran 
their own race with the big Stu

endurance over the four miles in
dicate the Barons are more in
terested in shaping up their bas

Cross country meets are scored 
by adding up the place finishes 
of the first five men from each 
squad. Thus, like in golf, the low 
score wins. The 15-50 victory over 
Steubenville represents a shut 
out. If Tech takes the first seven 
places, eight through thirteen are 
automatically given to the oppoPhoto by Walter GraymaaJLNnIRDF^N xEOH CRN
