New caf to open 
on first floor of 
Hunt Library
by Patrick Pettibon
Staffwriter
Staying in the library all night 
might taste a little better next fall 
when the Maggie Murph Cafe opens 
on the first floor of Hunt Library. 
The new campus eatery will serve 
coffee and grab-and-go sandwiches 
and salads.
Alumni, along with the University 
Libraries and Dining and Housing 
Services, are working together on 
the project.

Maggie Murph Caf will open next fall 
on the first floor of Hunt Library.
Its a great partnership between 
the library and Dining Services, 
said Tim Michael, director of Hous
ing and Dining Services.
Putting coffee shops in libraries is 
pretty common on college campuses, 
and theyre doing it in response to 
student demand, Michael said.
Alumnae from Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College, the Universitys 
former womens college that the 
caf is named for, began express
ing interest in funding the project 
last fall. Lami Grubb Architects have 
completed the design for the space, 
which features service and seating 
areas as well as dedication panels 
funded by alumni. Suzan Lami and 
Robert Grubb are both alumni of 
Carnegie Mellons School of Archi
tecture.
[Margaret Morrison alumnae] 
are so excited to have a place in the 
library, said Erika Linke, associate 
dean of University Libraries.
Housing and Dining Services. 
have not yet selected the vendor 
for the new caf. Michael plans for 
it to be open for longer hours than 
most campus dining locations, pos
sibly from 7 am to 11 pm. The menu, 
he said, would be suited to serving 
breakfast and lunch blocks on the 
meal plan.
Michael is excited about the 
options at Maggie Murph. The 
highlight will be the Starbucks 
coffee, he said. Well have a full 
cappuccino machine there.
Dean of University Libraries Gloriana St. Clair hopes the caf will 
increase student satisfaction with 
the library. Our real vision for this 
is that the library will become an in
tellectual commons, she said.
According to St. Clair, there are 
just over half a million visits to the 
library each year.
Linke and St. Clair predict a 
positive impact on the campus 
community stemming from the in
creased convenience to studying the 
caf will provide.
Typically, when people have 
eaten, they do better, said Linke.

Filled with problems and 
plagued by low turnout, stu
dent government elections
ended last week after two days 
of voting. Karl Sjogren and An
drea Hamilton won the election 
for student body president and 
vice-president, defeating each 
of the two other tickets by mar
gins of over 300 votes. Problems
in the process, however, bring 
these results into question.
Last Monday and Tuesday, 
1287 students  about 16 per
cent of the eligible student body 
 participated in elections. 
Among these students, 621
voted for Sjogren, a junior in the 
social and decision sciences and 
human-computer interaction
programs, and Hamilton, a 
junior in the bachelor of human
ities and arts program.
When we did get a great ma
jority of votes ... [we felt] like 
we had a bit of a mandate even 
if most of the campus [had not] 
voted, Hamilton said. Sjogren 
and Hamilton said that they

After 10 years of burgers, peanut-oil-bathed 
French fries, and increasingly clogged arteries, the 
Original Hot Dog Shop is leaving. The O, as many 
students know the first-floor University Center 
eatery, is the only food venue on campus open after 
midnight.
Sales at the O have dropped significantly this 
year, and the reason identified for leaving was fi
nancial, i.e. declining profits, said Tim Michael, 
director of Housing and Dining Services. Michael 
also noted that the O faced labor difficulties in the 
fall.
In a meeting with the University last Wednes
day, the O confirmed it would not renew its fiveyear lease before it expires on June 30, according 
to Michael. Parkhurst Dining Services conducted 
negotiations on behalf of Carnegie Mellon, with 
Michael involved in the process.
Students complaints started to increase, Mi
chael said, referring to the service at the O.

Poll shows opposition to bill f rights
by Shawn Wertz
Assistant News Editor
Campus Conversations met last 
Tuesday to discuss the results of their 
second round of deliberative polling, 
which affirmed overwhelming oppo
sition to the Student Bill of Rights at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Twenty-six participants in the poll 
were asked to share their opinions on 
certain issues. Their viewpoints were 
tallied on a scale of one to five. The 
average of the scores was recorded 
before and after the participants had 
a chance to learn more about the issue 
in question.
The focus of this poll was the pro
posed Student Bill of Rights, which
We hope that with a 
larger response rate, 
this could lead to policy 
changes.
 William Brown
would codify the prohibition of 
professors using their courses as a way 
of sharing personal political views 
with their students.
The participants were also asked 
how much they felt outside factors like
politics, corporations, and faith af
fected their educational objectives 
and course content.
The results of the poll suggested 
that the participants had changed 
their minds after learning about the 
issues through Campus Communi
cations.
Psychology professor Michael 
Bridges is responsible for collecting 
the data from the poll. Relative to 
the previous poll, we have had more 
of an effect with this one, he said at 
last Tuesdays meeting.
Bridges also noted at the meeting 
that in some of the categories, sig

between the participants preSee POLLING, page A3

Democratic debates
by Andrew Peters
Staffwriter
Hoping to supplant Catherine Baker Knoll 
as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant 
governor of Pennsylvania, three Democrats 
gathered in Hamburg Hall last Wednesday to 
outline their views and discuss their qualifica
tions.
Candidates William Hall III, Valerie McDon
ald Roberts, and Gene Stilp participated in the 
debate, which Knoll, the current lieutenant 
governor, did not attend.
In a letter to Suzanne Broughton, president 
of the League of Women Voters and coordina
tor of the debates, Knoll explained that her 
schedule had to remain open for events in 
the capital, leaving her no time to travel to 
Pittsburgh.
The expert panel in charge of questioning 
the candidates consisted of dean Mark Wessel of the Heinz School, dean Carolyn Ban of 
the University of Pittsburghs Graduate School 
of Public and International Affairs, and Tim 
Stevens, chairman and founder of the Black Po
litical Empowerment Project.

Student organizations 
hold Day of Silence
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
Last Wednesday was the quietest day of the 
year at 4000 schools across the country. Not 
because of a natural disaster or a national 
holiday, the silence was a result of the 500,000 
students who participated in the 10th annual 
national Day of Silence.
The day was one of the largest student-led 
movements in American history, according to 
an April 26 press release by the Gay, Lesbian, 
and Straight Education Network.

Tribute to The Tartans 
graduating staffers
f BrBradford Yankiver
As I think back over the past year,
I am astounded by the progress The 
Tartan has made. Impressed, but not 
surprised. Thats because the people 
who make this organization work are, 
hands down, the most diligent and im
pressive people I know.
More than 200 people have given 
their time and energy to The Tartan this 
year  that makes about 3.7 percent of 
the undergraduate student body.
The writers and editors of The Tartan 
have composed and edited more than 
1800 typical essay pages worth of 
articles and editorials. The Tartans pho
tographers have shot more than 25,000 
photographs. The Tartans artists have 
created several hundred cartoon strips 
and pieces of art. The Tartans busi
ness staff has sold over $86,000 in 
advertisements. All together, I estimate 
that our volunteer staff has dedicated 
over 23,000 hours to their work at The 
Tartan. I am eternally inspired and reju
venated by my colleagues.
All of us at The Tartan work so closely 
together that its easy to take each other 
for granted for most of the year. But 
as we wrap up the year, its impos
sible to forget that were losing some 
of the most dedicated and influential 
members of our staff.
First, I would like to extend best 
wishes to expert illustrator Jimi 
Okelana, The Tartans comics editor; to 
a wonderful mentor for The Tartans de
signers, assistant layout manager Reina 
Takahashi; and to former Pillbox editor 
Mandy Flynn. Jimi, Reina, and Mandy 
will be studying abroad next year. May 
your travels inspire and enlighten you
 and bring you swiftly back to us.
As always, graduation takes its toll 
this year. We reluctantly say farewell to 
dedicated and meticulous copy editors 
James Auwaerter, Anne DiGiovanni, 
Greg Price, and Arthur ODwyer, tal
ented journalist Laura Palotie, eternally 
creative Max Kaufmann, and to photo 
gurus Marcus Gho and Dexter Hu.
To the members of our editorial 
staff who will be leaving us in cap and 
gown this year, I offer a special thanks. 
These are people who created what The 
Tartan is now. These are the people 
whose vision for The Tartan will remain 
central to its essence for years to come.
Jackie Brook and Radha Chitale, for
mer editors of the Forum and Science 
& Technology sections, respectively, 
stepped directly into editorial positions 
upon joining The Tartan. Their insight, 
experience, and dedication have shaped 
the content and focus of this news
paper. I wish them the best luck as they 
continue their careers in the publishing 
world. Greg Prichard, former comics 
editor, built a comics section that made 
us all laugh every week, and hes cre
ated a slew of compelling content, 
such as this weeks Pillbox feature. Jim 
Puls, former online editor and systems 
manager, successfully implemented his 
vision that The Tartan would be one of 
the most technologically advanced col
lege newspapers in the world. Haseeb 
Qureshi, assistant business manager, 
has given his time and energy to The 
Tartan over many years in many ways.
Filially, I wish to thank and commend 
J.T. Trollman, former editor-in-chief of 
The Tartan. J.T. has been the most 
steadfast contributor to The Tartan in 
all of my experience with the organi
zation. It is rare to find such vision, 
professionalism, humor, and charisma 
in one person, but these qualities are 
natural to J.T. The Tartans current 
strength would have been impossible 
without his leadership. To a lifelong 
friend and teacher, I extend my most 
heartfelt gratitude.
To the many other supporters of The 
Tartan throughout the Carnegie Mellon 
community, I thank you for a wonder
ful year.
Bradford L. Yankiver, publisher of The 
Tartan, welcomes all responsible ques
tions and comments, which may be sent

Integrating math into global applications
From derivatives to diseases, mathematics becomes increasingly interdisciplinary
Candidates 
debate for 
primaries
GOVERNOR, from A1
for President with the Reform 
Party. Hall focused on Medicaid 
reform and property tax relief 
as the two main planks in his 
platform.
I wanted to see change in 
this country. I feel that people 
were unfairly represented, 
Hall said, stressing the need for 
common people to get involved 
in politics. This should be a 
country of the people, not of the 
politicians.
Roberts, the Allegheny 
County recorder of deeds, is the 
first black woman to be elected 
to countywide office. If she wins 
the election for lieutenant gov
ernor, she will be the first black 
person elected to a statewide, 
non-judicial office.
It is not about the party. It is 
not about me. It is about the peo
ple. It is about how I can serve 
the people in the best interest of 
the people, Roberts said.
Stilp, of Harrisburg, is a lob
byist and political activist who 
has been lauded by Ralph Nader 
for his use of large pieces of art 
to call attention to public policy 
issues.
I like the practice of legisla
tion  creating the fabric of 
legislation, Stilp said. I have 
the leadership skills, the vision, 
and the courage to promote that 
vision.
When Ban raised concerns 
that the candidates might split 
the votes and end up losing 
the election, Hall answered 
that he and Stilp had discussed 
stepping down to reduce the 
number of candidates.
We discussed that one of us 
should do that, but neither one 
of us probably would do that, 
Hall said.
Roberts reminded the audi
ence that she was the first to 
announce that she would be 
challenging Knoll.
One of the constitutional du
ties of the lieutenant governor 
is to preside over the State Sen
ate, which prompted panelist 
Mark Wessel to raise concerns 
over the current legislatures 
size and effectiveness.
According to Stilp, the legisla
ture is out of control. Given its 
cost to taxpayers, Stilp argued, 
it may be time to think about 
adjusting the size of legislature.
If the legislature were a cor
poration, it would be bankrupt, 
and the heads of the legislature 
would be in jail, Stilp said.
Hall and Roberts took a more 
moderate stance on the issue. 
According to Hall, the issue is 
not so much the size of the leg
islature but the effectiveness of 
the representation, which he 
thinks could use some work.
For Roberts, the issue is a dou
ble-edged sword. She explained 
that reducing the size of the 
legislature would make it hard 
for rural voters to communicate 
with their representatives.
They dont get the chance to 
interact with their representa
tives and elected officials in the 
same way people from urban 
areas do, Roberts said, indicat
ing that such rural voters could 
use even more representation 
than they already have.
Candidates also disagreed 
on what role the lieutenant 
governor actually plays in the 
government.
According to Roberts, the 
lieutenant governorship is a 
bully pulpit because it is an 
elected position. She plans to 
use her position in part to in
crease the number of women 
and minorities in government 
positions.
My vision is to make sure 
that the office is not just cere
monial, said Roberts, who sees 
the lieutenant governorship as a 
role of advocacy.
Stilp disagreed. It is crucial 
to realize that the lieutenant 
governor has to be in the boat 
with the governor, he said. If 
the lieutenant governor goes out 
and starts his own programs, 
that could have a disruptive in
fluence on the governor.
The event was a joint venture 
between the Heinz School, the 
Graduate School of Public and 
International Affairs at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, the Black 
Political Empowerment Project, 
and the League of Women Vot
ers of Greater Pittsburgh.
Primary elections for Lieu
tenant Governor are on May 16.

Past the piles of calculus 
homework and old theses strewn 
across the floor, a look into the 
Department of Mathematics 
at Carnegie Mellon provides a 
startling surprise: Math is in 
everyone elses business.
Whats no surprise is that 
Carnegie Mellon values an in
terdisciplinary environment. 
Though it is the product of many 
generations, interdisciplinary 
research formally became part of 
the Universitys Strategic Plan 
in 1998.
In the 21st century, mathemat
ics at Carnegie Mellon is travel
ing not only to different depart
ments, but out of the offices of 
Wean Hall and into the global 
centers of science and industry.
This is happening all over the 
world
According to David Kinderlehrer, professor of mathematics, 
the mathematics department at 
Carnegie Mellon and its peers 
at universities around the world 
have been doing a lot more ap
plied math in recent years. For
Kinderlehrer and his colleagues, 
applied necessarily means in
terdisciplinary.
Most often, I find myself in the 
company of colleagues who are 
not mathematicians, Kinderleh
rer states on his website. We are 
learning together what we could 
not do in our native disciplines: 
new science.
Though journals of applied 
mathematics line his shelves, 
Kinderlehrer cannot give a con
cise definition for applied math 
 because there isnt one.
[Mathematicians] are trying 
to get math into the laboratory 
to answer questions in biol
ogy, in mechanics, in physics, 
Kinderlehrer said, describing 
the implications of the move 
toward applied mathematics. 
This is happening all over the 
world.
According to Kinderlehrer, 
however, math should never be 
a service to other disciplines. 
The collaborative efforts of 
mathematicians around the 
world should serve to make 
mathematics a richer field of 
study. We are working with 
[scientists] to create new science 
for them and new math for us, 
Kinderlehrer said.
Kinderlehrers breakthroughs
are in materials science, and he 
uses mathematical simulations 
to control natural conditions in 
various materials. He is working 
to discover how to manipulate 
the granules present in almost 
all materials, elements that are 
often only few microns across.
About two years ago, Kinder
lehrer discovered a rational 
relationship to the composi
tion of granules where there 
was previously thought to be 
no relationship. The discovery 
has far-reaching implications 
for materials science. With the 
knowledge of how materials are 
composed, Kinderlehrer and his 
partners can start to understand 
how to mold materials to do what 
they want.
We do our tango
One of Kinderlehrers col
leagues, professor Irene Fonseca, 
works on both the mathematics 
of materials and computer vision 
and imaging.
Mathematics is present in 
everything around, from [in
formation technology] to biol
ogy to non-invasive surgery,
Fonseca said. The challenge to 
mathematics is that more and 
more the old way, [in which] you 
work with a pen and a pad, is no 
longer.
Fonseca stresses the need to 
break down barriers and work 
across disciplines to create a new 
breed of mathematicians capable 
of tackling many different types
of problems.
Its a long process, Fonseca 
said. We are all aware there are 
things that need to be changed in 
the curriculum.
Mathematical education is one 
of Fonsecas biggest concerns. 
She is worried that modern meth
ods of mathematical instruction 
 the computing environment 
and programming language Matlab, for instance  are changing 
the wdy students of math think 
and closing them down to differ
ent methods of creative problem 
solving.
Are we creating technicians 
or thinkers? Fonseca asked. 
We cannot replace thinking cre
atively with all the gadgets.
To tackle emerging issues 
in mathematical education, 
Fonseca will attend two differ
ent conferences in the coming 
weeks.
She will travel first to the 
Georgia Institute of Technology 
to discuss the potential for more 
effective kindergarten-throughcollege math curriculums. From 
there, she will travel to Lisbon, 
Portugal, to meet with business 
and industrial leaders and dis
cuss the role mathematics is playSee MATH, page A4

discussion opinions and their post-discus
sion opinions, which was what Campus 
Conversations was hoping to find.
The program seeks to gather infor
mation through deliberative polling, in 
which members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community are asked to learn about cur
rent issues through discussion groups.
The Southwestern Pennsylvania Pro
gram for Deliberative Democracy created 
Campus Conversations in collaboration 
with the Coro Center for Civic Leadership 
and University Libraries.
Campus Conversations can be an 
amazing tool to get information from 
the students, said Student Senator and 
contributor to Campus Communications
Michael Bueti. Everyone on this cam
pus has issues communicating, and using 
this could be used to aid in 
communication.
The first deliberative poll at Carnegie 
Mellon, which focused on campus diver
sity and moral values associated with 
file sharing, was conducted last Novem
ber. This first poll also included 90 par
ticipants more than those in the most 
recent poll.
Were dealing with small sample sizes, 
Bridges said. The fact that theres any
thing significant is interesting.
Biology professor William Brown, who 
is a member of Faculty Senate and 
attended the meeting, added, We need 
to do a better job educating people on the 
issues.
One significant change in participant 
opinion was on the actual proposed bill. 
Opposition to the Student Bill of Rights 
went from just under 50 percent before the 
poll was conducted to above 75 percent 
after the poll.
Maybe [the participants] were neutral 
before, but with the process of discussion 
they became interested, said Liz Style at 
last Tuesdays meeting. Style is from the 
Southwestern Pennsylvania Program for 
Deliberative Democracy.
Yet Bridges expressed reluctance in 
concluding that the deliberative poll 
expressed the general view of everyone 
on campus because of the sample size.
If we could get a response rate of 50 
percent of a 200-person sample size, Id be 
happy to talk about this generalizing the
situation, he said.
Brown also expressed the desire for a 
larger sample.
We hope that with a larger sample 
response rate, this could lead to policy 
changes, he said.
But some form of action is expected to 
arise from the polls results. Bueti gave his 
report of the results to Student Senate last 
week. He felt at the meeting that the re
sults would allow Student Senate to forget 
about the Student Bill of Rights.
Theres now an overwhelming opinion 
associated with the numbers that people 
dont want this here, Bueti said. If people 
dont want it, then we shouldnt be work
ing on it.

THE TARTAN  MAY 1, 2006
Day of Silence, Holocaust remembrance give voices to minorities
SILENCE, from A1
However, Wednesday wasnt 
the only day last week in which 
student organizations chose 
to highlight minority issues 
on campus. The event coin
cided with a SALSA-sponsored 
lecture on immigration last Tues
day and Hillels name-reading of 
Holocaust victims in honor of 
Holocaust Remembrance Week.
ALLIES, the organization that 
arranged the Day of Silence on 
campus, understood the need 
for recognition of all minority 
groups. Their goal for this years 
event was to reach more minor
ity groups on campus than ever 
before  not just those of sexual 
orientation.
The organization wanted 
also to focus on ethnic and re
ligious minorities that empha
sized the voices of their own 
groups not always heard on 
campus.
Artistic, race, religious, or 
sexual  all these are differ
ent forms of silence, said AL
LIES president Vijay Jesrani, a 
senior in English and social and 
decision sciences. Most people 
tolerate differences on campus, 
but there are still some students 
who feel discriminated against.
Wednesdays Day of Silence 
was the fourth at Carnegie Mel
lon for Jesrani, but this year 
ALLIES increased efforts to make 
the event more inclusive for all 
campus minorities.
Were all on the same level, 
said Jesrani, who reported a pos
itive response from most groups 
on campus.
ALLIES collaborated with a 
host of other organizations rep
resenting minorities on campus, 
including Multicultural Council, 
SPIRIT, SALSA, SOHO, and sex
ual assault advisors.
Like the Day of Silence, the 
immigration lecture and namereading were also intended to 
transcend their typical audiences 
and resonate with those beyond 
the minorities who are directly 
affected.
The immigration crisis that is 
going on in the U.S. is affecting 
more than just Latinos, stated 
SALSA secretary Radiris Diaz, 
a junior in business administra
tion and modern languages, via 
e-mail. Tuesday nights event 
should have been more of a uni
fication than a lecture.
The event was a presentation
by guest lecturer Enrique Mo
rones, president and founder of 
the Border Angels, a non-profit 
humanitarian group that pro
vides aid to immigrants crossing 
the Mexican border. The goal of 
the organization is to prevent un
necessary deaths of individuals 
traveling between Mexico and 
California.
Mariana Achugar, assistant 
professor of Spanish and second 
language acquisition, agreed.
Usually immigrants appear 
as less than human, represented 
through images or words that 
characterize them as a threat 
to the nation or different from 
us, Achugar stated in an e-mail. 
These images make it easier for 
people to distance themselves 
from those who are being af
fected by these legislations and
debates.
That distance is something 
that Deena Zytnick and David 
Rush, co-presidents of Hillel, un
derstand well.
While the Holocaust affected 
Jews, it also affected a lot of 
other minorities, said Zytnick, a 
junior psychology major.
For several hours on Wednes
day, Hillel representatives stood 
outside of Doherty Hall and read 
the names, ages, and places of 
death of Holocaust victims 17 
years old or younger. It puts a 
name to the statistics, Zytnick 
said.
Still, the group was only able 
to read a small selection of the 
names. Reading the information 
of all child victims would take 
80 days, 24 hours a day, Zytnick 
said.
These children were too 
young to have their voices 
heard, she said. She said that 
todays teenagers and college 
students are the next generation 
of people responsible for continu
ing to commemorate the lives of 
the Holocausts youngest vic
tims.
Thats what the Day of Silence 
was doing  symbolically giving 
those groups voice, said Rush, a 
junior in psychology and humancomputer interaction.
As for the overarching goal 
of all the minority groups that 
were in the spotlight last week, 
theyre all trying to stop being 
silent, Rush said.
Theyre trying to get people 
to think about what happened 
in the past and change it for the 
future.
The O to close shop
ORIGINAL, from A1
of the first Original Hot Dog 
Shop in Oakland, posted notes 
at the campus location last week 
with a message addressed to the 
students of Carnegie Mellon. The 
notes claimed that Parkhurst 
and Carnegie Mellons contract 
was way out of line, with a 
postscript declaring that the O 
would only accept a contract 
identical to the contract signed 
last year.
We were number two or three 
on campus in terms of volume
 or thats what they told us, 
said Simon, referring to the ven
dors profit rank among campus 
eateries. They gave us a list of 
insurances that weve never had 
before, that my insurance agent 
said we dont need for a food 
court. I think its -an unleveled 
playing field.
Simon also said that Parkhurst 
prohibited the O from raising 
prices, when costs have gone up 
35 to 40 percent in the food in
dustry.
Tim Michael was a little 
rude, he added.
Simon attributed the decline 
in profits to labor shortages.
The problem was with the 
help. We worked hard, but some 
managers quit, and we had calloffs, and we apologize for that. 
I dont think [the new vendor] 
will try as hard as we did, said 
Simon.
Simon also felt that increased 
competition played a role in de
clining profits.
Michael noted the decline in 
profits may be attributed to a 
growing interest in healthier 
dining and lifestyles.
The 0s specialty is ham
burgers and French fries. Their 
most famous item is their bag 
of fries. While theyre delicious, 
theyre probably not the healthi
est things for you, Michael said. 
The 0s menu has not changed 
to reflect the change towards 
healthier eating.
Michael claims that he and 
the Parkhurst staff offered assis
tance to the 0s management in
reviewing their business model. 
This included reviewing the 
menu, the staff, and the hours 
of operation for efficiency and 
customer appeal. Ultimately, 
they hoped to discern the reason 
for dropping sales, but Michael 
claimed the 0s management 
never responded to requests for 
a business plan.
According to sources at the 
Original Hot Dog Shop offices, 
the current economic climate is 
creating difficulties for everyone 
in the restaurant business.
I dont think he knows the 
first thing about food, or the 
food business, said Simon, re
ferring to Michael.
On May 9, at the last meet
ing of a Dining Advisory 
Committee, asubsidiaryofDining 
Services, there will be a discus
sion about filling the vacancy 
in the University Center in the 
wake of the 0s departure. 
According to Michael, this 
meeting will include a group of 
students, faculty, and staff rep
resentatives who provide input 
and feedback on campus dining 
operations.
It makes me sad. Weve al
ways come to the O late night, 
said Rebecca Obley, a junior in
formation systems major and a 
Pittsburgh native. My dad went 
to Pitt and used to talk about go
ing to the O late night.
According to the 0s website, 
Sid and his wife Essie opened the 
first venue in Oakland shortly 
before the 1960 World Series 
in which Bill Mazeroski hit a 
game-winning home run for the 
Pirates, only a few blocks away 
at Forbes Field. The O has re
mained in Oakland for 47 years 
and at the University Center for 
10 years. 
Michael said that it is his 
intention -to continue to meet 
the demand for a late-night 
food venue in the University 
Center.
CMU students were a plea
sure to have as customers, Si
mon said. Of all the stores I 
have, I really appreciated those 
kids, and I know my employees 
did too.
Maggie Murph Caf to open in Hunt Library
HUNT, from A1
We see how student needs have been chang
ing. Were looking as well to build some group 
study rooms.
Additionally, the opening of the caf 
marks a change in the librarys policy regard
ing food. Students will now be permitted to 
eat throughout the library, except in the fine 
and rare books room. Keeping the building 
clean will be a priority for the library staff, 
but they hope students will pitch in, Linke 
said.
At least one student on campus vis eager 
for Maggie Murph to open.
Ill be happier to spend a lot more time 
in the library, said Jack Meade, a sopho
more art student. And with all that time in 
the library, I might even learn to read next 
year.This first-floor area of Hunt Library will become the Maggie Murph Caf next fall.

Professors take math to new levels
MATH, from A3
ing in the global marketplace. On a broader 
level, the conference will deal with the ways 
in which the state of the economy impacts the 
educational curriculum.
To what extent are industries interested 
in universities? To what extent is that neces
sary? Fonseca asked, indicating the need for 
an information pipeline between industry 
and academia to properly inform a study of 
mathematics.
It is a dance. We do our tango, we show 
what we have to offer, and they present their 
problems, Fonseca said.
What kind of math do I use?
If anyone knows the tango, it is professor 
Shlomo Taasan. He has been working closely 
with biologists and physicians at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), 
trying to understand diseases by using math
ematical tools. Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh received a shared 
grant from the National Institute of Health in 
September to pay for this kind of research.
Taasan is trying to develop mathematical 
models that will describe the progress of dis
eases and the inner workings of the immune 
system.
Once we know about it, we can stop it, 
slow it down, accelerate it, Taasan said.
Though he is trying to answer some of the 
most daunting questions in immunology, 
Taasan doesnt have any degree in biology.
Ive had to review my statistics, Taasan 
said.
In addition to his work in immunology, 
Taasan also works on understanding men
tal illness, specifically depression. He had a 
hunch that the ups and downs characteristic 
of mild depression could be studied with a set 
of pre-existing simulations  the ones used 
in the stock market to measure fluctuations. 
Taasan took some computational finance 
courses and borrowed the math he learned 
for use in his own biological computations.
This research has made me learn areas of 
math I didnt know, Taasan said. Im trying 
to use all the areas of math I ever learned. 
The question is, what kind of math do I use?
Like Fonseca, Taasan explained that every 
discipline has its own language and its own 
code. To cope with the language of biologists, 
Taasan has tried to take a qualitative ap
proach to math, moving away from math that 
uses just real numbers and toward math with 
only a few levels. According to Taasan, bi
ologists just do not speak and think the same 
way as mathematicians  and vice versa.
Its not simple to convince them to change 
the way they are doing things, Taasan said. 
I will change anything I need to.
According to Taasan, the best way to get 
a feel for what scientists do is to make regu
lar trips to medical research laboratories and 
communicate with scientists at work.
The purview of many fields
Across the Mall from Taasans workspace
is the office of dean John Lehoczky, who, 
in addition to leading the school of Humani
ties and Social Sciences, holds positions in 
both the statistics and mathematics depart
ments.
Lehoczkys work in computational finance 
has him running into many of the same dif
ficulties that Taasan faces at UPMC  the 
same ones that Fonseca is crossing the pond 
to talk about in Lisbon. He has to communi
cate mathematical research to the giants of 
finance through intermediaries who do not 
share his understanding of mathematics.
Just like Taasan and Kinderlehrer, Lehoc
zky uses mathematical models to solve inter
disciplinary problems in finance. According 
to Lehoczky, his collaborative work forms the 
basis for Carnegie Mellons master of science 
in computational finance, the first program 
of its kind anywhere in the world.
We combined the statistics department, 
the math department, Tepper, and the Heinz 
school into a seamless program designed for 
students, Lehoczky said, explaining that 
while Wall Street had barely heard of Carn
egie Mellon a decade ago, computational 
finance masters are now in high demand.
Lehoczky attributes the program to the 
universitys interdisciplinary nature of 
academics. According to Lehoczky, it is a 
model of academia toward which other institu
tions are moving out of necessity.
This is the era of big science projects, 
Lehoczky said. The projects are not the 
purview of any [one] field; they are the pur
view of many fields.
Sjogren and Hamilton elected to executive positions
Olga Strachna/Photo Staff
Karl Sjogren and Andrea Hamilton were elected the student body president and vicepresident in last weeks elections.
RESULTS, from A1
were not happy with the voter turnout, 
but they were happy with the results.
Kirk Higgins, a junior mathematical 
sciences major, won the race for student 
body vice-president for finance, with 
over 55 percent of votes cast.
This years turnout is a throwback to 
the turnout of 2003 and is a decrease 
from the peak participations of 2004 
and 2005. In 2003,1249 students voted, 
while in 2004 and 2005, over 2100 stu
dents went to the polls.
You cant always expect elections to 
be phenomenal, and its sort of fine that 
they werent phenomenal, Hamilton 
said. So basically, this was an average 
year.
Daniel Papasian, a senior political sci
ence major and Senates chief technical 
officer, feels voter turnout is not easily 
interpreted.
Is this a regression to the mean or 
a decrease in turnout? I dont really 
know, he said. But students seem more 
apathetic.
In addition to low turnout, two 
problems came up in the middle of the 
voting period. First, the system only 
listed students who pay the student 
activities fee and have over 35 units of 
coursework as registered voters. Elec
tion rules recognize all students who pay 
the student activities fee and have over 
19 units of coursework as voters, so un
til noon last Tuesday, about 70 students 
were incorrectly unable to vote.
Elections officials fixed the problem 
after one student communicated his 
inability to vote. They e-mailed the af
fected students at noon last Tuesday, 
and all but five voted. In light of this, 
the Elections Board decided that if the
margin between the two top tickets was 
within five votes, the results would be 
invalidated.
Second, Justin Berka was the first 
student since the advent of the online 
voting system to run for both student
body president and Student Senate. The 
online system automatically associated 
Kelly Duncan, his running mate, with 
his Senate nomination. Thus, when stu
dents voted for Berka for Senate, they 
automatically cast a vote for Duncan as 
well. The Elections Board quickly fixed 
this issue.
That was not that big a deal, said 
Franklin Williams, a senior social and 
decision sciences major and chair of 
the Elections Board. There werent any 
problems other than the ones online, and 
those [had] not been dealt with before. 
Williams commended the Elections 
Board for fixing problems not found in 
previous years.
The student government elections 
process faced more problems than those 
the Elections Board fixed last week. Be
fore elections began, candidates missed 
petition deadlines, and the board pushed 
back the platform deadlines. Williams 
said the board did not feel that these 
problems justified an invalidation of the 
results.
The board also considered the breach 
of another rule in March. Student Sen
ate did not confirm an Elections Board 
until March 23, almost a month after the 
February deadline set by elections 
rules.
The late confirmation date ... trig
gered a series of problems. We were put 
in a position where we had to either not 
give sufficient notice or have elections in 
May, Papasian said. A lot of issues come 
up if we have elections after May 1.
Election rules state that there must be 
at least 30 days between the confirma
tion of the board and elections.
Current Student Body President Tom 
Sabram, a senior majoring in chemical 
engineering, believes that the scarce 
amount of campaigning also caused 
problems.
Had I not actually been in student 
government, I dont think I could [have 
told] you who was running, Sabram 
said. He also felt the candidates could 
have taken advantage of the huge 
crowds at Carnival to campaign and get 
their messages out.
The list of new Senators has not been 
finalized. Over 40 write-in candidates 
are eligible to enter Senate, and they 
will be screened by Senate over the next 
few weeks.
Student Senate ratified the election 
results last Thursday, and the Graduate 
Student Assembly will vote on result 
ratification this Wednesday.
Next year, Sjogren and Hamilton 
hope to improve the image of student 
government in general. Sjogren aims to 
increase visibility and accountability of 
student leadership.
The problem is that when [students] 
think of student government, they dont 
think of that as an outlet for any sort of 
interest, Sjogren said. When students 
see student government as a functional 
entity, theyll want to be a part of it.

CMU team 
wins digital 
game grant
by Todd Blose
Junior Staffwriter
Last fall, mtvU and Cisco 
Systems set out to find college 
students with innovative ideas 
that could help develop digital 
content for the next genera
tion. A team of Carnegie Mellon 
graduate students, Arnab Basu 
and Vance Wallace, have been 
awarded a $25,000 grant to do 
exactly this.
Their winning program, 
among nine others, came from 
a call for submissions issued 
last year from mtvU; the cho
sen greenlit programs are a 
combination of short-form 
programming, gaming, blog
ging, instant and text messag
ing, and other forms of interac
tion that can enhance the digital 
mainstream on mtvU. These 
innovative and original projects 
will be featured on-air, online, 
and on campus for the next six 
months.
mtvU is a 24-hour college 
network owned by MTV. Their 
intention with the contest was 
to select one group of individu
als from the entire naiton to help 
develop the broadband content 
of tomorrow that their network 
thrives on. The company offers 
opportunities for students to 
help improve and program mtvU 
as they see fit. Their partners in 
this effort, Cisco Systems, are a 
worldwide supplier of network
ing hardware and software.

by Hanadie Yousef
Science & Technology Editor
Danith Ly is an assistant professor in the 
department of chemistry. His lab focuses on 
research and development at the interface 
of chemistry and biology, with emphasis 
on the development of chemical tools and 
the application of genomics and proteomics 
technologies to better understand the foun
dations of biological problems.
A molecule at the center of his research 
is peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a synthetic
analogue of DNA and RNA. PNA expresses 
a unique ability to form sequence-specific 
hybrids with complementary DNA and RNA 
strands in accordance with the Watson-Crick 
base pairing rules. The resulting hybrid ex
hibits stability to temperature, nucleases, 
and proteases. PNAs most important use is its 
ability to silence the expression of a targeted 
gene at the mRNA level. There are currently 
some problems to overcome before PNA can 
be used as an effective tool for therapeutics, 
diagnostics, and basic research, though. 
Undergraduates in the Ly lab are currently 
working on a variety of projects involving
PNA, with the goal of eventually creating an 
efficient molecular tool.
A major obstacle to the success of PNA in
volves its ability to permeate the cell mem
brane and be effectively taken up a cell. PNA, 
due to its molecular structure, has both hy
drophobic and hydrophilic properties. While 
the hydrophobic elements are able to pass 
through the lipid bilayer, the hydrophilic 
part gets lodged in the lipid, eventually caus
ing lysis, or destruction, of the cell.

Feeling the beat: movement influences infant rhythm perception
by Radha Chitale
Contributing Editor
Rhythms are vital from the 
beginning of our lives. Consider 
that the first thing a fets feels 
is his mothers heartbeat. Later, 
upon developing ears, the baby 
hears the murmured voices of his 
parents. What is the response to 
rhythm? A kick or twist: in other 
words, movement.
Rhythm perception and move
ment response is a humans first 
mode of communication and 
continues to develop as the per
son grows. New research by 
Jessica Phillips-Silver, a Carn
egie Mellon alumna, has shown 
that movement is connected to 
beat perception and encoding. In 
other words, how you move is in
fluenced by the rhythms you hear
and remember.
Phillips-Silver, a PhD candir 
date at McMaster University in 
Hamilton, Ontario, tested her hy
pothesis with seven-month-old 
infants, exposing them to ambig
uous beat patterns and bouncing 
them in various beat combina
tions. For example, some infants 
were bounced on every second 
beat and some on every third 
beat. Previous experiments had 
been done on adults, but one of 
the goals of this experiment was 
to determine the multisensory 
experience of music and how that 
develops earlier in life, PhillipsSilver said.
Infants were tested for their 
rhythmic preferences by expos
ing them to a variety of rhythm 
patterns. Based on how long the 
infants listened to the pattern be
fore turning their heads away or
getting distracted, Phillips-Silver 
could tell what they liked. In
fants listen to what they like more 
and what is familiar, Phillips-Sil
ver said. The infants consistently 
chose to listen longest to rhythm 
patterns that matched those pat
terns with which they had been 
physically bounced to.
To ensure that the infants were 
encoding beat perception based 
on sound and motion rather 
than learning the beat patterns 
by watching the researchers 
bounce with them, Phillips-Silver conducted another set of 
experiments similar to the previ-. 
ous ones, only without moving 
the infants at all. Instead, a re
searcher bounced in front of them 
to ambiguous beat patterns while 
the infants were held still. In

How Things Work: Hypnosis
George Diabes
Even though it originated 
in India during the late 15th 
century, hypnosis is a psycho
logical phenomenon that is still 
not fully understood by scien
tists and doctors today. From 
quitting smoking to sheer enter
tainment, hypnosis has a wide 
range of applications that offer 
an interesting technique of con
necting to ones subconscious 
on a deeper level.
Many people mistakenly be
lieve that when under hypno
sis, inhibitions are lost and a 
sleeplike state commences in 
which the subject will perform 
every whim of the hypnotist. 
While brain waves are relaxed 
and heart rate may decrease, 
a state of hyperactivity begins. 
Individuals become extremely 
concentrated on the task at 
hand proposed by the hypnotist 
and can zone out other distract
ing stimuli  making it seem 
that they may be sleepy. Fur
thermore, while inhibitions are 
lost and many people will per
form embarrassing things while 
under hypnosis, people do have 
a choice and hypnotists do not 
have the power to make people 
perform things that they do not 
want to do.
In the late 19th century, 
French neurologist Jean-Martin
Charcot' implemented hypnosis 
for the first time as a treat
ment for hysteria. This first 
application in medicine led to 
a plethora of studies performed 
by psychologists throughout 
Europe and America seeking 
to better understand hypnosis 
and its usefulness in medicine. 
Emile Coue, a French pharma
cist, sought to understand the 
theory behind hypnosis and 
consequently popularized the 
current term the power of sug
gestion. His modification of 
past hypnosis theories included 
three major laws: the Law of 
Concentrated Attention, the 
Law of Reversed Effect, and the 
Law of Dominant Effect.
Under the Law of Concen
trated Attention, Coue pointed 
out that when an individual 
dwells upon one topic repeat
edly, it often will spontaneously 
appear in ones conscious mind 
later when similar conditions 
or a primed word or activity is 
experienced. In the Law of Re
versed Effect, Coue emphasizes 
that the harder an individual 
tries to do something, the 
smaller the chance of success for 
that individual. Lastly, the Law 
of Dominant Effect states that a 
stronger emotion or suggestion 
will tend to replace weaker ones 
while under hypnosis. Coupled 
with previous hypnosis theory,
Coue helped to better describe 
the effects and power of hyp
nosis throughout the early 20th 
century.
Current studies on hypnosis 
provide detailed analyses on 
brain activity during hypnotic 
states using electroencephalo
graphs (EEGs). EEGs can proAriane Simon/Layout Manager
vide data measurements for 
electrical activity in the brain. 
Some studies claim that while 
under hypnosis, individu
als experience an increase in 
low-frequency waves that are 
associated with sleeping and 
a decrease in high-frequency 
waves that are associated with
heightened levels of concentra
tion, alertness, and wakefulness. 
This data disproved many 
earlier theories that did not 
consider the possibility that 
hypnosis was a sleeplike state; 
however, this data confirms 
that the conscious mind does 
become subservient to the sub
conscious mind.
Along with brainwave data, 
researchers studied the effect of 
hypnosis on the cerebral cortex. 
Studies have shown that while 
under hypnosis, activity in 
the left hemisphere decreases 
and activity in the right

heightened under hypnosis.
In the modern day, hypnosis 
has been accepted and endorsed 
for medical and therapeutic 
purposes by many professional 
organizations, such as the Brit

to treat many psychological ill

Haplotype Mapping 
Project is underway
A new project based of off 
the human genome project 
is currently underway to provide 
a public database of human 
species variation. It attempts 
to map the genetic evolution 
of certain human characteristics. 
Scientists compare DNA patterns 
to determine genetic factors that 
relate to disease and resistance. 
The HapMap project identifies 
tiny genetic disparities, called 
SNPs, which describe traits such 
as hair, eye color, and disease 
resistance. Results of the project 
are speculated to provide bettertargeted drugs.

Hurricanes caused 
by global warming?
The intense debate over global 
warming has led to speculation 
that the increased frequency 
of hurricanes in last years 
hurricane season may be caused 
by global warming conditions. 
Warmer waters and increased 
winds are thought to be due to 
greenhouse gas accumulation. 
Some experts disagree and 
contend that natural cycles cause 
these fluctuations of events. 
No matter the case, increasing 
temperatures are a current 
climate trend. In fact, emissions 
and gas accumulation patterns, 
have grown steadily since 1970. 
Scientists expect an increased 
number of hurricanes this year 
as well.

Bacteria and beans 
are better for you
A new study shows that 
fermenting beans with certain 
strands of bacteria draws out 
more nutrients from them and 
increase their digestibility. Beans 
are naturally hard to digest. 
Fermentation causes a reduction 
of indigestible compounds and 
fibers in beans. The breakdown 
of fibers in the fermented 
beans allows increased nitrogen 
absorption, a necessary nutrient 
process for survival, and reduces 
methane released by bacteria 
within the stomach.

Kimberly Kicielinski, a senior 
chemistry and psychology major, 
will leave Carnegie Mellon this 
May to attend medical school at 
Penn State. Kicielinskis three 
years doing research at the UPMC 
Hillman Cancer Center have not 
only helped her in deciding her 
future career plans: They have 
also contributed to further cancer 
research.
Kicielinski was able to isolate 
a certain type of enzyme, known 
as the CYP3A4 enzyme. It is part 
of a family of enzymes, called 
cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which 
normally metabolize chemicals 
entering the body. The CYP3A4 
enzyme was found in both the 
tumor cells and normal cells of 
kidneys. This enzyme is involved 
in the deactivation of carcinogens 
and the activation of certain anti
cancer drugs, specifically benzaldehyde dimethane sulfonate. The 
structure of this drug consists of 
two branched side arms that can 
cross-link DNA and prevent DNA 
replication of cancerous cells.
The procedures taken to isolate 
CYP3A4 were not simple. One of 
the main goals was to identify 
the enzyme that made the key 
metabolite, an N-dealkylation 
product that is characterized by 
a 258 mass to charge ratio (m/z) 
(as detected by mass spectrom
etry). First, mice liver cells were 
centrifuged and viewed through 
a spectrophotometer, which iden
tifies compounds by weight. The 
microsomes, which are small par
ticles in the cytoplasm consisting 
of fragmented endoplasmic re
ticulum and attached ribosomes, 
produced the most metabolite.
The different cofactors NADH 
and NADPH, which are energy 
sources for the enzyme, were 
added to mice liver enzymes. 
An m/z of 258 is most produced 
in NADPH, which pointed to 
the presence of CYPs. Next, the 
reaction was run in a nitrogensaturated and then a carbon mon
oxide-saturated environment. 
The production of metabolite 
with an m/z of 258 was minimal 
in both, which also pointed to
wards the presence of CYPs. With
Kimberly Kicielinski, a senior chemistry and psychology major, was able to 
isolate the CYP3A4 enzyme, a potential key player in anti-cancer drugs.
the presence of a heme group, 
CYPs require oxygen to func
tion. In oxygen deprived environ
ments, the expected outcome of 
decreased metabolite production 
was seen.
If CYP activity is inhibited, 
then the production of metabo
lite, m/z 258, should be present 
in minimal amounts. Different 
chemical inhibitors, 3A4, 2D6, 
and 2C9, were added to human 
microsome. The 3A4 inhibitor 
showed the most inhibition. This 
result was supported by another 
experiment performed with 
commercial antibodies; CYP3A4 
produced the most metabolite.
Knowing the enzyme respon
sible for metabolism provides 
insights into the kinetics of the 
drug, Kicielinski explained.
Kicielinski was one of 79 
(among 300) selected to pres
ent her research at the Posters 
on the Hill event on Capitol Hill 
last Monday and Tuesday. Kicie
linskis accomplishments, from 
her scientific discoveries to be
ing a supplemental instructor for 
chemistry, exceed more than just
academics; she is also on the cross 
country team. She is receiving 
scholarships from the chemistry 
department and Phi Beta Kappa.
I think being an SI leader 
was one of my most important 
involvements. I really enjoyed 
it and it helped me gain useful 
skills, especially being able to 
explain concepts on a bunch of 
different levels, Kicielinski said. 
She also added, Being on the 
cross country team also exposed 
me to health-related problems, 
like orthopedic injuries. It also 
helped me with time manage
ment. I work better when I have a 
schedule.
Kicielinski plans on becom
ing an oncologist. Although she 
enjoys being a researcher, she 
would rather be a clinician and 
have patient contact.
Her advice to undergraduates 
interested in pursing a science 
related career is: Always do what 
you want to do. Dont do some
thing just to build your resume. 
Sometimes I do things, even if its 
to the detriment of my grade. Do 
what makes you happy.

The use of marijuana for 
medical purposes has been de
bated for many years. While 
some consider the plant to be a 
phenomenal ailment reliever, 
others believe that the 
psychoactive and harmful ef
fects overpower the possible 
benefits. In the most recent 
chain of events, on April 20, the 
FDA rejected medical use for 
marijuana. Although a number 
of states have passed legisla
tion allowing for marijuana to 
be used medically, the FDA says 
that these laws are inconsistent 
with the new rulings.
Canada has taken a different 
route from the U.S., however, 
and has allowed for medical 
testing and prescription use 
of the substance. Canadian 
researchers have recently dis
covered that marijuana can 
cause the neurons in the brain 
to regenerate.
Marijuana has been on the 
medical scene in the US since 
the beginning of the 19th cen
tury. Doctors recommended 
that it should be sold over the 
counter as a pain reliever, but 
it soon lost popularity with the 
development of aspirin. In 1937,
Congress passed the Marijuana 
Tax Act, which eventually led 
to use of the substance being 
criminalized. The American 
Medical Association was 
the solitary opponent to this 
legislative step. Since that time, 
marijuana has been outlawed 
by the federal government and 
has been banned for medicinal 
use.
In the 1960s, marijuana was 
found to reduce intra-ocular 
(internal eye) pressure and 
helped patients with glaucoma, 
helping to prevent blindness. 
It was also found to eliminate 
the nausea experienced during 
cancer chemotherapy. Lastly, 
marijuana was found to control 
muscle spasms associated with 
spinal cord injury.
The part of marijuana that is 
responsible for the high con
dition associated with the drug 
was found to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. The 
chemical compound was iso
lated, approved by the FDA, and 
sold under the name Marinol. 
Marinol had too many side 
effects and was too expensive 
for the common person. Smok
ing marijuana also immediately 
releases THC into the blood 
stream, while taking a capsule 
took an hour before relief was 
finally felt.
In 1996, California permit
ted patients to use marijuana 
for medical purposes. This 
led to political contradictions 
because a state law conflicted 
with a federal law. The pub
lic disagreed with laws that 
restricted patients use of mari
juana. The federal government 
then decided to modify their 
policies. They did not change 
their perspective on outlawing 
marijuana, but allowed for more 
marijuana research in order to 
better understand its effects.
The reliability of medicinal 
marijuana research has been 
questioned. This is because an 
effective placebo for marijuana 
cannot be created, as traditional 
research methods require. A 
placebo is an inactive substance 
that is given as a control and has 
no therapeutic effects. Using 
humans as subjects, two groups 
would have to be created, one 
that received marijuana and one 
that did not. The psychoactive 
properties of marijuana cannot 
be replicated in a placebo, and 
thus prevents such an experi
ment from being conducted.
The debate and controversy 
surrounding the use of medici
nal marijuana is expected to 
continue until a successful com
promise between researchers 
and proponents is reached.

A malfunctioning dysbindin-1 gene, which has been linked to cognition 
and schizophrenia, causes a disturbance in a neuron synapse.
by Disha Shah
Staffwriter
How did she do that? Have 
you ever wondered what allowed 
your roommate to do better than 
you on that particular test, even 
though you studied together? 
Dont you just love to put all the 
blame on the hard test or the pro
fessor who is clearly out to get 
you? Now you could also just 
blame it on your genes. A recent 
study done at Feinstein Institute 
for Medical Research in Glen 
Oaks, N.Y., traced intelligence to 
a gene that seems to be a major 
influence on cognitive abilities.
The researchers showed that 
cognitive abilities are directly 
linked to a certain gene, 
dysbindin-1. It is found in key 
brain regions linked to cognition
 specifically learning, problem 
solving, and judgment  as well 
as memory and comprehension. 
More than 11 previous studies 
have associated this gene with 
schizophrenia, a mental disor
der that causes people to hear 
internal voices that other people 
dont hear or to feel extremely 
paranoid, thinking that people
are going to harm them in some 
way.
Researchers at the Zucker 
Hillside Hospital along with 
Harvard-Partners Center for Ge
netics and Genomics in Boston 
studied 213 patients with schizo
phrenia and compared them 
with 126 healthy volunteers. 
They not only studied their cog
nitive abilities but also examined 
six DNA sequences known as sin
gle-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs). They found one specific 
pattern of SNPs that was asso
ciated with general cognitive 
ability, impaired in the group 
with schizophrenia and the 
healthy volunteers who were car
riers of the risk variant.
A robust body of evidence 
suggests that cognitive abilities, 
particularly intelligence, are sig
nificantly influenced by genetic 
factors. Existing data already 
suggests that dysbindin may 
influence cognition, said Kather
ine Burdick, the studys primary 
author, in a sciencedaily.com 
report. We looked at several 
DNA sequence variations within 
the dysbindin gene and found 
one of them to be significantly 
associated with lower general
cognitive ability in carriers of 
the risk variant compared with 
non-carriers in two independent 
groups.
Scientists speculate that 
dysbindin-1 plays a major role 
in communication between neu
rons in the major brain areas 
associated with cognition. Since 
the gene also promotes survival 
of these neurons, an alteration 
would cause failure in protect
ing the neurons from dying,
ultimately leading to poor intel
ligence and cognition.
While our data suggests 
the dysbindin gene influences 
variation in human cognitive 
ability and intelligence, it only 
explained a small proportion of 
it  about three percent, said 
Anil Malhotra, a principal re
searcher in the study. This sup
ports a model involving multiple 
genetic and environmental influ
ences on intelligence.

incubating the GPNA with zebra 
fish embryos, we wish to uncover 
many genes that are essential 
in the developmental process in 
vertebrates, said Hsieh.
One of Lys major projects and 
the underlying theme of the lab 
involves the development of a 
molecular tool that uses PNA to 
better understand the relation
ship between human embryonic 
stem cells (HESCs) and tumorigenesis.
Lys interest in HESCs lies at 
the heart of a novel hypothesis 
that outlines a direct causal re
lationship between cancer cells 
that form tumors and the mal
functioning of stem cells.
The hypothesis states that, 
cancer cells that develop into 
tumors are a direct result of mal
functioning HESCs. Stem cells, 
during their relatively short 
existence, are regulated by a 
pathway known as the Wnt sig
naling pathway. When turned 
on, this pathway tells the ESC to 
continue dividing, or differenti
ating, without regard to repara
tions. In this stage, damaged cells 
can be ignored because only one 
cell will make it past this stage 
and into maturation in order to 
form a human cell type.
The Wnt signaling pathway 
turns off at the maturation state. 
But if it doesnt turn off due to 
mutations, it can lead to can
cerous cells that form tumors. 
This hypothesis is supported by 
the fact that the Wnt pathway 
is turned on in both embryonic 
stem cells and cancerous cells, 
although it is turned off in nor
mal adult cells. Also, tumors 
are made up of a heterogenous 
mixture of cells. This is a strong 
indication that tumor cells can 
differentiate into other cell 
types. This goes against the stan
dard belief that cancerous cells 
that form tumors are caused by 
the uncontrolled reproduction of 
a single cell, which would result 
in a homogenous mixture.
This new discovery would 
make sense of why cancer drugs 
are often not effective on tumors. 
These cells prelude cancer 
drugs. Taxol, for exampl^, works
by binding to microtubules, ar
resting cell differentiation at the 
G2M stage. With ESC, there is 
not a site where Taxol can detect 
mutations, due to the Wnt sys
tem, said Ly.
Ly hopes to one day be able 
to use PNA as a molecular tool 
to address this hypothesis. Spe
cially engineered PNA molecules 
could be used to short-circuit the 
Wnt pathway in cancer cells by 
turning off expression of certain 
genes in the pathway and ana
lyzing its effect on cancer cell 
production. PNA is a tool were 
developing to solve the question 
of human embryonic stem cells, 
said Ly.
The PNA molecule must be 
further modified before it could 
be used to study this hypothesis. 
A current problem that exists is 
in the penetration of ESC. Those 
cells are significantly more dif
ficult to penetrate than regular 
cells due to a specialized pump 
system that actively removes 
foreign material from them. 
Ly is trying to engineer these 
molecules so that they can pen
etrate the cellular membrane of 
ESC cells. This could be done by 
designing PNA in such a way to 
knock out the membrane pump.
PNA technology competes with 
current technology being co-developed to silence genes, known 
as RNA interference (RNAi). The 
advantage of PNA is that it does 
not need any chemical enhanc
ers to stimulate its activity inside 
a cell. RNAi relies on intracellu
lar enzymes, whereas PNA works 
independently, said Armitage.
PNA is already being used by 
researchers at the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center to 
downregulate epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) in pa
tients with head or neck tumors. 
This gene was found to play an 
important role in tumor aggres
siveness, and PNA-regulated 
silencing of the gene has resulted 
in tumor shrinkage.
The use of PNA as a molecular 
tool to study gene function and 
the relationship between tumor 
cells and stem cells holds great 
promise. \
GRANT, from A5
The student groups on our first 
Digital Incubator development 
team are pushing the boundar
ies of digital media, and were 
proud to hand over our network 
as a laboratory for their creative 
passion, said Stephen Fried
man, the general manager of 
mtvU, in a Cisco Systems press 
release.
Scheduled to be released in 
September, the idea proposed 
by Basu and Wallace involves 
an online game creation tourna
ment that would be populated 
with games cultivated and pro
moted by college students from 
across the country. Each entry 
will be submitted to a competi
tive bracket where advancement 
will be determined by how often 
the game is played and the num
ber of votes it gets from college 
students. The top four will be 
showcased on mtvUs Gamers 
Ball tour, which will be visit
ing campuses across the United 
States in the fall. Their main
concern with this idea was to 
make this tournament a success
ful national platform for college 
students to promote games they 
have developed.
Basu believes that mtvUs 
collaboration will help shape 
the broadband technologies 
of tomorrow. Broadband pro
gramming is becoming more 
mainstream than ever before. 
Consumer demand has reached 
a critical threshold where viewership warrants watching only 
the money shots. We are excited 
to provide a platform for col
lege students, who are at the 
threshold of defining the next 
generation of gaming and en
tertainment, to showcase their 
game development prowess. 
said Basu when describing his 
involvement. Our ultimate hope 
is that the Gamers Ball Devel
opers Tournament becomes an 
annual fixture in the calendars 
of game development programs 
and universities across the na
tion for students to compete for 
the title of the best student-proRhythm links movement

these cases, the infants showed 
no preferences for arty beat pat
terns. Phillips-Silver proved 
that observing movement does 
not reinforce the accents in the 
sound. So what does it take to 
recreate in the mind the rhythm 
you heard and felt? PhillipsSilver asked. It requires subject 
movement.
Phillips-Silver became highly 
interested in the connection be
tween movement and rhythm 
perception as an undergraduate 
in the Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts program. With a dual 
major in psychology and music, 
Phillips-Silvers undergraduate 
work laid the foundation for 
her doctoral work. My term pa
per went on to become my PhD 
thesis, Phillips-Silver said.
Working with seven-montholds became a personally 
interesting study for PhillipsSilver on how infants respond 
to music. Babies giggle to 
the rhythm. They roll them
selves, trying so hard to dance, 
Phillips-Silver said. Her evi
dence on rhythm encoding in 
infants shows that humans must 
have an innate ability to respond 
to rhythm. The way people move 
shapes what they hear, and 
though this is a learned process 
that occurs early in life, skill in 
the area can be acquired with 
practice. Hopeless cases are 
very very rare, Phillips-Silver 
said. All types of adults have 
been tested and even with naive 
subjects, the effect was there. 
But cultures that do it more are. 
better at it.
Phillips-Silver also dispelled 
the myth that playing classical 
music for babies will make them 
more intelligent, saying that 
it is not founded on credible 
scientific evidence. However, 
music is emotionally and per
ceptually rich for babies and 
movement makes it richer due 
to the encoding that occurs in 
the brain. Play whatever [to 
babies] you like, Phillips-Silver 
said. But move with it.
PNA, from A5
increase the cellular permeabil
ity of PNA without inhibiting its 
ability to freely diffuse through 
the cell and hybridize with RNA 
or DNA, said Brian Belardi, a 
sophomore chemistry major who 
is currently working on a proj
ect to tackle the issue of cellular 
uptake. This [modified PNA] 
involves the use of a disulfide 
linker molecule, which contains 
a modified positively charged 
guanidinium group. The posi
tively charged PNA will increase 
the cellular uptake, and then ... 
the reducing environment of 
the cell will reduce the disulfide 
bond, cleaving the positively 
charged group. Thus, this will 
hopefully allow PNA to diffuse 
freely through the cell without 
any electrostatic interference.
What makes Professor Lys 
research so nice is that he takes 
groups of peptides that are im
portant, and attaches them to the 
backbone of PNA. This is a novel 
approach to nucleic acid analog, 
said Bruce Armitage, a profes
sor in the chemistry department 
who is also working with PNA. 
Currently, Armitage is collabo
rating with Ly to develop PNAs 
that can be used as anti-cancer 
agents. The specially designed 
PNAs will block the expression of 
three specific proteins involved 
in cancer.
A derivative of PNA, known as 
GPNA, has already been devel
oped. It is less toxic than PNA, is 
cell-permeable, and can regulate 
gene expression. Its synthesis 
required the incorporation of 
the guanidinium functional 
groups into the PNA backbone. 
Currently, Andy Hsieh, a senior 
biology major, is working on 
utilizing this molecule to bet
ter understand gene function. 
I am trying to apply the GPNA 
in our lab to a model organism, 
specifically vertebrates. A zebra 
fish is externally fertilized and 
translucent, making it easy to 
manipulate and observe under 
a microscope. We can identify 
gene function by knocking down 
a specific gene using GPNA. By

At the close of every year, The Tartan 
reassesses the years events. We present 
here a list of the people and happenings 
that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go 
to people and events that had a positive 
effect on the campus community; thorns 
go to those that have negatively impacted 
the campus.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon for 
hosting 26 Tulane students who 
were displaced after Hurricane Katrina. 
Going away to college is stressful enough 
without environmental catastrophes, 
and were proud that CMU was able to 
lend a helping hand to some of Katrinas 
victims. Its telling of our hospitality 
that after spending a semester here, 
many Tulane students wanted to stay.
A black and gold thistle to the 
Stillers for showing us that for once, 
theres something that can bring us all 
together.
A thorn to Facebook users for ever 
thinking that it was a private site. 
Listen, fellas: If youre really surprised 
when your RA busts you for red-cupping 
it in 73 photos your friends posted, then 
were not even sure how you got here.
A thistle to CMU sports teams for 
doing us proud. With mens basket
ball having the best season in the history 
of the school, we have reason to cheer.
g&j A thorn to Student Senate for consistent incompetence. Senators should 
be passionate and knowledgeable, but 
this year they were uncommunicative 
and uninformed. When Optimus Prime, 
Mao Yisheng, and readme became seri
ous write-in candidates, we knew that 
this years student government was re
ally one big joke.
A thistle to Faculty Senate and 
members of the administration who 
took a stand against neo-conservative 
activist David Horowitzs egregious Aca
demic Bill of Rights (ABR). In particular, 
we commend professor Michael Chemers for writing the Faculty Senate resolu
tion that formally protested the ABR and 
paved the way fo,r the Faculty Senate to 
make that protest public.
A thistle to the Activities Board 
(AB) and its chair, Andrew Moore, 
for not giving in to the sensationalism 
that arose after AB showed Pirates. Sex
ual matters have become American 
medias most likely to hype topic, and 
were proud that bqth AB and Moore did 
not let a few Puritans interfere with a 
popular campus tradition.
An especially prickly thorn to 
KDKAs Marty Griffin for his coverage of Pirates. All Griffin managed to do 
was uncover was a campus tradition, 
sensationalize the story, and get his facts 
wrong. If over 3000 people showed up 
to watch it (during three showings in an 
auditorium that seats 400), then how 
can the majority of the 5000-person stu
dent body be offended by it?
A thistle to Carnegie Mellons green 
. practices. We are consistently 
ranked among the top 25 campuses for 
recycling, and all of our newest build
ings are LEED-certified. When it comes 
to environmentalism, CMU leads by 
example.
#
A thistle to Computing Services for 
the new printing system. While we 
think the quotas themselves are unfair, 
the new kiosk system and pop-up print
ing from anywhere are outstanding 
improvements for both users and trees.
A thorn to the administrative pow
ers that be for doing nothing to 
make up for the loss of the Drill Deck as a 
performance and practice space. Worse, 
plans for a new exercise/dance space in 
the Highlander Caf were scrapped in 
favor of adding another dining facility. 
Existing rehearsal spaces are already 
constantly overbooked, and now it will 
only get worse.
lfi|| A thistle to the Oakland Review, 
which after a brief hiatus and a 
slightly problematic first year back in 
2005, has returned with a bigger staff 
and a greater commitment to quality. 
Were pleased to see the publication rise 
from non-existent two years ago to the 
great read it is today.

We would give athorn to JFC 
for their failure to appropriately 
distribute money among student organi
zations on campus, but we misallocated 
it to another, less deserving group.
0$% A thistle, two sides, and a drink to 
^ the newly combined Housing and 
Dining Services. Even though we feel en
titled to complain perpetually about 
campus food, we must admit that its fi
nally getting better. Were glad somebody 
finally had the spine to stand up to 
Parkhurst and push for quality./
Even though they fell to Stanford in 
the final DARPA Grand Challenge, 
a thistle goes to Red Whittakers Red 
Team Racing for driving CMU into the 
national spotlight as a leader in techni
cal innovation. Now if only he could fix 
the chronic paper jam in the Morewood 
Gardens cluster.
||| A thistle to special-interest firstyear housing at Carnegie Mellon.
Jenn Kennedy/Art Staff
Places such as Forbes House and Global 
Studies House have fostered meaningful 
first-year communities built around 
scholarship and intellectual discourse, 
and are a proud addition to campus.
#
A thorn to Student Affairs for let
ting two deposed fraternities return 
to their newly renovated houses on the 
Quad next year. Reportedly, millions 
have gone into these two houses. While 
we understand all buildings should 
eventually be renovated, these two de
linquent fraternities got the express fix 
despite bad behavior.
t
A. 100-foot-tall thorn goes to Jill 
Kraus, the CMU trustee who do
nated Walking to the Sky and the 
Kraus Campo. Do we really have to ac
cept every steaming pile of art that 
Kraus thrusts at us? Were sorry if Presi
dent Cohon says differently, madam, but 
these eyesores just arent welcome.'
A thistle to Mack Scogin Merrill 
Elam, the architecture firm in 
charge of the new Gates Center. Scogin 
has visited the CMU campus monthly 
(sometimes weekly) to make sure his 
firm is taking every possible aspect of 
our campus into account. If only Jill 
Kraus could follow his example!
Despite sub-par PR, a thistle (and 
applause) to the School of Drama 
for a smashing season, including the first 
amateur production of Urinetown (rated 
by many critics as better than the Broad
way production) and a performance of 
Nathan the Wise simulcast to our col
leagues in Qatar. Drama at CMU is 
making a significant contribution to our 
global university.
^
A thorn to the planners of the 
Beaux Arts Ball. If you want to 
treat students of legal drinking age like 
criminals, completely botch the slate of 
entertainers at one of the venues, serve 
nothing but pretzels, and water down a 
grand campus tradition into something 
lame, at least dont charge $40 a ticket.
The thorn to this years student government elections is pointed mostly 
toward Student Senate, for failing to 
even appoint an elections committee on 
time. Every deadline was bungled: All 
three candidate teams seemed to forget 
that they should probably get their plat
forms in before, say, the night before 
elections began. Like maybe two weeks 
before, when they were due.
A preemptive thistle to whoever 
^ first climbs Walking to the Sky. 
We know someone will do it eventually, 
and whoever you are, you have our ad
miration. Hows the view from up there?
The West cannot abandon 
Hamas, Palestinian people
Hanadie Yousef
The subject of Palestine dominates 
United States foreign policy in the 
Middle East, but subtly: It is the ex
tremely influential Israeli lobbying 
committees on Capitol Hill that incor
porate their personal interests into 
our American foreign policy, much to 
our.detriment. Those interests do not 
benefit U.S. national security; instead, 
Israeli interests cause further chaos, 
and Americans must bear the brunt of 
it all. 
Israel has engineered an American 
national agenda by funding groups 
as public relations agents, includ
ing the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee (AIPAC). Like successful 
advertisements on television encour
aging you to buy into their product, 
lobbies for Israel have mastered subtle 
psychological techniques that convince 
Americans they are protecting their 
own national interests by supporting 
Israel. Recently, they have done so by 
focusing their greatest effort on disil
lusioning Americans perceptions of 
Hamas, the newly elected Palestinian 
government, as a tool to stop finan
cially supporting Palestinians.
Israeli officials have sought to 
capitalize politically on the outcome 
of the Palestinian elections, divert
ing the attention of the international 
community away from Israels viola
tions of international Jiuman rights 
and humanitarian law in the occupied 
territories and refocusing it on the 
newly elected Palestinian government. 
But Israel refuses to recognize the 
new government of its closest neigh
bor. While there is no international 
legal obligation on Israel to recognize 
the Palestinian government, its ag
gressive measures to undermine the 
government constitute an attack on 
the right to self-determination by the 
Palestinians. This right is recognized 
by the UN Charter and upheld by the 
UN General Assembly, Security Coun
cil, Commission on Human Rights, and 
the International Court of Justice.
By freezing funds, lobbying against 
international assistance, and impeding 
Palestinian security services, Israeli of
ficials have been starving the Palestin
ian economy. Comparing these actions 
to an appointment with a dietician, 
the special adviser to the Israeli prime 
minister, Dov Weissglas, stated that 
the Palestinians will get a lot thinner, 
but wont die.
In the last 17 years, Hamas has grown 
very strong as a resistance movement 
among mainstream Palestinians who 
have been brutally occupied by Israel. 
Though it is a democratically elected 
government, Hamas has lost almost all 
international support and essentially 
all of its assistance. As a result, and as 
Mahmoud Abbas made clear in an April 
21 BBC article, Palestinians are facing 
a humanitarian catastrophe.
This international abandonment 
casts doubt on the credibility of our 
drive for democracy in Iraq and the rest 
of the Middle East. After all, former 
U.S. president Jimmy Carter led the 
Carter Center/National Democratic 
Institute observation of the Palestin
ian elections in January and concluded 
that officials were elected in a fair and 
honest manner,, sticking to American 
democratic values.
This plays perfectly into the hands 
of Israel. By cutting off all contact with 
the Palestinian government, the United 
States is only dialoging with Israel. Lack 
of communication with the Palestinians 
promotes the stereotype and illusion 
that Hamas is a radical Islamist terror
ist organization, which is untrue. This 
is best put in a recent article written by 
the Council for the National Interest
Foundation (CNIF): Many Americans :: 
do not understand that Hamas is a typi:q 
cal anti-colonial insurgency responding to an Israeli occupation and whatamounts to government terror against 
Palestinian civilians. It is not at all ren 
lated to al-Qaida or 9/11.
Americans do not see or read about u 
how for a year Hamas has held a unilateral ceasefire with Israel even though .,, 
Israel continues its illegal and immoral. 
assassinations, called extra-judicial T 
executions, that have killed more inno.! 
cent Palestinian civilians than supposed r_T 
militants. If an American majority knew i * 
of these activies, it would be outraged. >- 
Moreover, Israel continues its illegal, 
internationally renounced, exclusively 1 r 
Jewish settlement expansions into what-, 
is left of the Palestinian , homeland. In d 
fact, as the CNIF noted, Our $3 billion 
of direct aid to Israel each year is be-bl 
ing used to destroy any peace process.^ 
It is being used to build illegal Israeli ,3- 
colonies in the West Bank that will ;; 
soon contain eight percent of the Israeli':: 
population (around 400,000 Jewish Is-~r 
raelis) and take over 25 percent or more'*; 
of the West Bank, the heartland for a fu-" 
ture Palestinian state. This is the singles 
greatest obstacle to peace. . ,H
Lobbies for Israel have shaped Ameriu 
can policy by influencing Congress and, , 
albeit indirectly, the public at large. 
How have they possibly managed to;*, 
manipulate the minds of Americans, to . 
convince us that helping Israel is more!; 
important than our own national interests and our own safety? According to r 
a recent study by professors at Harvard  
and the University of Chicago, AIPACs  
success is due to its ability to reward leg
islators and Congressional candidates 
who support its agenda and to punish. 
those who challenge it. Money is critical . 
to U.S. elections and AIPAC makes sure^ 
that its friends get strong financial sup.. . 
port from the myriad pro-Israel political:: 
action committees.
Is it truly in our best interest to cut off': 
funding to Hamas or, for that matter, for  
the rest of the Western world to do the-n 
same thing? This only endangers our 
security and national interests, because . 
isolating Hamas encourages the group to * . 
do what starved people must do to sur-J 
vive: find financial aid from any source 
for its people. Hamas history has shown 
its commitment to the health and care of 
its people; is it supposed to grovel to the 
rest of the world, compromising its peo0 
pies integrity, just to provide for them^- 
what every human deserves? Of course n 
not  Hamas will turn to the only other  
countries that are willing to give them -Ti 
aid: Syria and Iran. b
This will further isolate the United 
States from key Middle Eastern countries 
and escalate animosity due to mis' 
communication and the United States 
unwise foreign policy that is heavily 
biased toward Israel. Daniel Levy, the ' 
former advisor to prime minister Ehud o 
Barak, summed up our foreign policy 
quite nicely in a Haaretz interview: De
fending the occupation has done to the 
American pro-Israel community whatn 
living as an occupier has done to Israeli 
 muddied both its moral compass and*,, 
its rational self-interest compass.
From September 2000 until March 
2006, 3982 Palestinians and 1084 d 
Israelis have been killed in the conflict, - 
and this includes many children: 708 
Palestinians and 123 Israelis. It is time ' 
for us to put our foot down, start an > 
open dialogue with the Palestinian goviy. 
ernment, and do what is in everyones ;J 
best national interest. As Ismail Hani[j 
yeh, the Palestinian Authority prime., 
minister, stated, We in Hamas are for 
peace and want to put an end to the 
bloodshed. Though we are the victims, 
we offer our hands in peace, but onlyj 
peace that is based on justice.

Approaching 
the future

Tom Sabram
I have been honored to serve 
as your student body president 
for the year. This year, we have 
witnessed many interesting 
events, such as the selection of 
a new dean of Student Affairs, 
outrage over public art on cam
pus, the showing of the Activities 
Boards TBA films, minor student 
government conflicts, and the 
campus reaction to Hurricane 
Katrina  just to name a few. 
These events are sometimes one 
of the perks of the position but 
can also be extremely time-con
suming. I wish I had more time to 
go back and work on many of the 
initiatives I talked about during 
my campaign for student body 
president.
I am proud to say that the area 
of campus life that has seen the 
largest improvement is dining. 
Though some still complain, the 
results of a survey showed that 
most students think the campus 
food is neither good nor bad, 
but acceptable. The renovations 
to the area formerly known as 
Highlander Caf, as well as new 
additions to the dining system, 
should help the upward trend 
continue.
As Nicolette, Nick, and I pre
pare to graduate and conclude 
the year, we must ensure a 
smooth transition for the new 
leaders of student government. 
On Wednesday, the Graduate 
Student Assembly should confirm 
this years student government 
election results. Despite the low 
voter turnout, Karl, Andrea, and 
Kirk will do an amazing job ful
filling the duties in their new 
positions. Outside of the tran
sition process, I will list a few 
suggestions to alert the entire 
campus community about initia
tives that need to be worked on.
Communication desperately 
needs to be improved on campus. 
I would love to see a new and cre
ative way for the announcement 
of events on campus. Hopefully, 
the idea of adding events moni
tors to the University Center will 
finally come to fruition. Also, the 
administration needs to find a 
better way to pass along impor
tant messages to students other 
than using only e-mail.
The campus community needs 
to be more open to the ideas be
hind change. Be willing to allow 
something to happen prior to 
complaining about it. This is 
the only way we can change the 
campus and try to remove some 
of the apathy.
I would like to congratulate all 
of the seniors who will be gradu
ating, and wish good luck to all 
students who will be returning 
next year. I encourage everyone 
to work with Karl, Andrea, and 
Kirk, for they will have a lot of 
work to do, but will be great for 
the positions.
Tom (sbp@J is excited to gradu
ate in three weeks. If you have any 
questions feel free to e-mail him.
Carnegie Mellon opens doors to franchises at expense of culture

Immigration article prejudiced against HispanicsTerrorism has neither religion nor nationality
I cannot believe that U.S. policies of 
entitlement allow immigrant freeloading 
[April 17] was published in our schools 
newspaper. As a Hispanic immigrant and 
a scholar at Carnegie Mellon University, I 
felt this article was a slap in the face to me 
and those like me.
The article was blatantly racist and 
lacked knowledge. [Author Benjamin] 
Hacketts statement about Social Secu
rity, welfare^ Medicaid, and Medicare as 
a means for immigrants to ignore indi
vidual labor was extremely snotty and 
obnoxious.
Hispanics are not the only people in 
the United States that benefit from these 
programs, which were set up to help all 
Americans. Furthermore, Hispanics pay 
taxes just like everyone else in this coun
try, so we deserve the right to have access  
to these programs.
His claims about immigrants not being 
hard workers were ridiculous. My mother 
and I have worked extremely hard in this 
country just to get by. She works a meager 
janitorial job in a hospital. It barely pro
vides for everything that we need and yet 
she does it with a smile. As for me, I came 
to this country as a child and have proved 
that I can achieve anything through hard 
work. My mom and I have struggled long
and hard in this country, without any 
form of government assistance, and for 
Hackett to belittle our struggle is to be
little our existence.
Hacketts emphasis on the need for 
Hispanic immigrants to assimilate into 
American culture clearly expresses how 
oblivious he is. The United States is not 
a homogeneous nation. It is composed 
of one of the most diverse groups of 
people in the world. Hackett states that 
European immigrants have been able to 
assimilate, but the presence of Italian, 
Russian, and other European communi
ties is strongly felt in this country. These 
immigrants brought their respective cul
tures, languages, and practices to the 
United States, just as Hispanics have done 
and will continue to do.
Hackett fails to realize that this is an im
migrant nation. Even those who made up 
the original history of this country were 
immigrants just looking for a better gov
ernment and a better life. The American 
dream should not be denied to anyone, no 
matter how many racist and ignorant ar
ticles like this one are published.

I would like to thank The Tartan its 
coverage of the Saudi Open House on 
April 19. The article [Saudi Students 
House holds event to promote national 
awareness, April 24] was quite nice; 
however, I want to raise concerns about 
using the following sentence in the be
ginning of the article: Pamphlets laid on 
tables provided information about Islamic 
terrorists.
The pamphlets contained statements 
made by many Saudi officials, scholars, 
and intellectuals condemning terrorism. 
They also contained statements from 
U.S. officials, including the 9/11 com
mission report that commended the level 
of cooperation of Saudi Arabia with the 
international community in combating 
terrorism. So I really dont think that the 
words Islamic terrorism are an accu
rate description of the contents of those 
pamphlets.
In addition, terrorism has neither a re
ligion nor a nationality because there are 
fanatics within every ideology around 
the world. There are people who blow 
up abortion clinics in the name of Jesus 
(peace and blessings of God be upon him). 
We cant call them Christian terrorists; we 
cant even refer to those actions as Chris
tian terrorism because the teachings of
Christianity are exactly the opposite of 
these actions. We cannot accuse the en
tire faith of the actions of a few people 
who want to advance personal interests 
and agendas through twisted interpreta
tions of religion.
Islam is a religion that is followed by 
1.5 billion people around the world, and 
it does not teach terrorism. The Quran, 
which is the word of God revealed to the 
prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings 
of God be upon him), teaches us that kill
ing one soul is like killing all humanity.
The whole purpose of our event was 
to educate the audience about our val
ues, our customs, and our culture, and 
to show how distant they are from the 
stereotypical images usually displayed in 
the media.
I truly appreciate the efforts made by 
The Tartan in providing a good coverage 
for the event, but I am very concerned 
with the negative image that might ap
pear in the minds of those who see the 
association of Islam as a religion with ter
rorism. We are a people for peace, and our 
faith, values, and culture are innocent of 
terrorism.
Nazeeh Alothmany 
Saudi Open House Organizing Committee
At Carnegie Mellon, we might 
not have good weather, athletic 
prestige, or a suitable male-tofemale ratio, but  lets face it 
 were loaded with personality.
As far as Im concerned, a col
lege campus isnt successful until 
it starts to feel like its own little 
world. And Carnegie Mellon has 
certainly pulled it off. If you were 
around for this years Carnival, 
you know what Im talking about. 
I dont think any other schools 
have birthed a 1200-pound 
Death Star dome or even know 
the proper meaning of the word 
Buggy. Well always be a little 
eccentric, but Im not complain
ing. Carnegie Mellon isnt just 
100 acres a few miles from down
town Pittsburgh: its a culture.
But changes to our campus 
facilities are threatening that 
culture. Whats the problem? In 
a word: chains. Kinkos recently 
took up residence in the base
ment of the University Center, a 
move that may supplant Print
ing Services in the future. The 
UC houses the Carnegie Mellon 
book, art, and computer stores; 
Entropy; and staples of campus 
dining such as Skibo, Andys, and 
S Seor. Amid such personal es
tablishments, a Kinkos seems 
more than a little out-of-place.
. Think thats bad? Rumor has it 
that Dining Services is also ready 
to make room for a franchise. I 
suppose theres no sense in start
ing small: Next year, we might be 
getting a Starbucks.
And then what? How can we 
be sure that Starbucks will be 
the only food chain to invade our 
campus? Our dining facilities 
cover a lot of the standard fastfood niches; it would be easy to 
replace them. Asiana could be
come a Panda Express; E Street 
Deli, a Subway; Si Seor, a Taco 
Bell. Everybody loves fullness 
from a value menu  how about
from a meal block? What hap
pened to the good old days, when 
the closest thing Carnegie Mellon 
had to a chain was the O? When 
our only franchise was Gingers, 
with its two little siblings in 
Baker and Purnell?
Not every corporate triumph 
has to be a tragedy. Chains offer 
one thing everybody likes: lower 
prices. But when youre talking 
campus dining, the food is go
ing to be a ripoff no matter the 
server. Carnegie Mellon might 
make more money, but there 
will be no financial benefit for its 
students.
All this worrying might sound 
a little unrealistic. Its hard 
to imagine a Carnegie Mel
lon flooded with chain eating
food franchises. In fact, it seems 
a rather appropriate addition to 
an academic environment. Its 
conducive to work and even in
tellectual banter. But once we get 
used to a Starbucks on campus, 
other chain restaurants will in
variably seem less offensive. Its 
hard to un-pop a precious cam
pus bubble.
Let me tell you what Im not 
worried about. Im not worried 
about corporate chains taking 
over the mom-and-pop opera
tions of the world. This isnt 
about Starbucks vs. Kiva Han 
or McDonalds vs. the O. If any
thing, its the world vs. Carnegie 
Mellon.
We have one thing at stake, and 
thats the worth of our campus. A
establishments. Wait  is it? 
Maybe were taking the -integ
rity of our campus for granted. 
Maybe weve been spoiled by a 
precedent of commercial-free 
dining. America is loaded with 
colleges and universities whose 
food courts all mirror the inside 
of an airport. On our campus, a 
McDonalds would be an eyesore. 
But students at multitudes of 
other schools walk by such fastfood restaurants every day with
out batting an eye.
That would be the worst-case 
scenario: if corporate restaurants 
on our campus somehow made 
their way into the norm. From a 
business perspective, Starbucks 
is the perfect gateway chain. Its 
less loathsome than most other
university has the opportunity 
to be a bit of a sanctuary for its 
students. If you want a campus 
that spills into its surrounding 
commercial neighborhood, try 
the University of Pittsburgh or 
NYU. Theres something pre
cious about the Carnegie Mellon 
bubble, including its charming 
selection of restaurants that no
bodys ever heard of. Lets hope 
we dont join the ranks of other 
schools who have surrendered 
their personalities for profit.

Supersize that Big Mac meal. Get that

And then, when youre all done, try 
taking on Americas most megalithic, 
over-inflated company: the General 
Motors Corporation.
As students, the rise and fall of our 
countrys biggest slow belly-flop is a 
prime lesson in precisely what not to 
do. Were at a stage where analyzing 
our mistakes is a matter of course. And 
if theres anything in American culture 
that screams to be fixed, its the bigger 
is better mentality that affects not only 
our consumers, but our corporations 
too.
Hungry Jack TV dinners arent the 
only over-indulgent things the country 
is gobbling up. And weve been doing it 
for decades.
General Motors is a mirror of our cul
ture. In 1955, it became the first Ameri
can corporation to make over $1 billion 
a year  an enormous achievement 
in the post-war boom where your car 
was your status symbol, and the more 
chrome the better. From 1954 and on 
and off through the 90s, GM ballooned 
to become the largest U.S. corporation in 
history. Even today, as the worlds larg
est auto manufacturer, it sells one out of 
every four vehicles sold in the States.
Its too bad, then, that in 2005 GM lost 
over $8.6 billion, and that it loses money 
on nearly every car it sells in the U.S. to
day.
GM is a culture of excess, of mam
moth proportions and corner-cutting 
engineering. You dont need to look any 
further than its brand garage to gauge 
its girth: The General has owned or 
had a partnership in over 18 car brands 
worldwide. As you read this, it still has 
three brands abroad and eight sprawling 
brands in the U.S. alone: GMC, Cadillac, 
Buick, Hummer, Chevrolet, Pontiac, 
Saab, and Saturn. Its enough to make 
you wonder what theyre doing with all 
of them, considering at least two (Saab 
and Saturn) have never even made De
troit a dime.
The rebadging bungles, manage
ment inflation, brand identity loss, and 
a culture of follow-the-industry (in
stead of leading it) are just the tip of the 
iceberg.
Before we get ahead of ourselves, lets 
look at just how much GM has made us 
buy into the supersized culture. And to 
do that, theres no better decade to look 
at than the disco era: when your parents 
were sporting bell bottoms, and when

THE TARTAN  MAY 1, 2006Ail
Gospel of Judas shows betrayer in new lightOur new student leaders 
must seize opportunities
We must not lower our expectations for student governmentCan you discover the depths of God? 
Can you discover the limits of the Al
mighty? (Job 11:7)
No, you cannot.
The recent publishing of the Gospel 
of Judas is a perfect example of exactly 
why.
The problem: The discovery and 
translation of the 1700-year-old man
uscript contradict much of what the 
Christian church has established. It is 
a direct threat to its sovereignty, being 
referred to as a heretical text.
For the past 2000 years, Judas has 
been regarded as the ultimate betrayer. 
His love for money pre-empted his love 
for Jesus and resulted in Jesus capture 
and crucifixion.
The Gospel of Judas, however, illumi
nates Judas as having the most intimate 
relationship with Jesus of all the disci
ples. Judas is told by Jesus, Step away 
from the others and I shall tell you the 
mysteries of the kingdom. Jesus saw 
Judas as a prodigy with a capacity for 
understanding and servitude much 
greater than that of the other disciples.
In the Gospel of Judas, Jesus even 
laughed at the disciples when ,asked 
about a fundamental truth of faith. 
When his disciples heard this, they 
started getting angry and infuriated 
and began blaspheming against him in 
their hearts. When Jesus challenged 
the faith of the disciples, they all said, 
We have the strength. But their souls 
dare not stand before [Him], except for 
Judas Iscariot.
So Judas reviled depiction cast in 
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts 
could, in fact, be a result of a jealousy 
within the disciples for Judas aptitude 
of understanding and the resulting at
tention provided to him by Jesus.
After Judas death, the 11 remaining 
disciples invited Matthias to become 
the 12th, and Judas would then be 
associated as the 13th, permanently 
one step away from the righteous group 
of 12.
According to the Gospel of Judas, 
Jesus informed Judas that this is what 
his legacy would become. You will be
come the thirteenth, and you will be 
cursed by other generations  and you 
will come to rule over them. In the last 
days they will curse your ascent to the 
holy [generation].
Judas actions would then not be a 
lasting example of a depraved man 
smitten by a weakness for the worldly 
desire of greed, but that of a man of the 
highest caliber  a man who was most 
revered by Jesus and willing to sacrifice 
his own name and life for the greater 
good of mankind.
Does it not make sense that such 
a large responsibility  ensuring 
Jesus be crucified, the cornerstone of 
Christianity  be entrusted to his most 
worthy of disciples?
The kiss of Judas, the kiss of be
trayal given by Judas to Jesus before 
His death, is thus not a kiss synonymous 
with betrayal but with the final show of 
affection from an enduring friendship.
If these claims are valid, then the 12 
disciples, not Judas, in fact represent a 
lesson in the limits of man.
By its very nature and the fact that 
the text has survived as long as it has, 
one could claim that it is God trying to 
manifest himself to a world which has 
lost its way. His manifestation would 
act contrary to a perpetual human 
force trying to suppress such episodes 
that act contrary to established be
lief systems and threaten to unhinge 
a persons window of faith. Once this 
window becomes unhinged, a person 
loses their protection and is exposed to 
the raw elements on the other side. One 
could say man resists change to avoid 
such experience in an effort to secure 
the special interest of worldly under
standing and control.
When man accepts change, it allows 
for new belief systems and interpreta
tion. One successful example is Martin 
Luthers ability in the 1500s to embrace 
and promote change from the norms 
set in place by the Catholic Church, re
sulting in a sweeping movement which 
lead to the eventual construction of the 
many Protestant denominations.
It is a matter of control. The thought 
is if one asks the right questions and 
narrows their beliefs, then one will 
ultimately find the truth. Therefore as 
one gains information, it narrows and 
forms a pyramid with a point on the 
top resulting in the answer. For Chris
tians, this answer is Christ. This results 
in the assumption and deduction that 
there are absolute correct answers and 
that there is only one way to look at a 
problem.
Using control is an extremely useful 
and convenient methodology of faith, 
as it allows one to have a very comfort
able and finite belief system, useful,
yet very limiting to a persons spiritual 
growth.
If one never challenges and attempts 
to go beyond his or her established set 
of beliefs, what does that say about that 
persons spiritual journey?
One can liken the history of Christian 
thought to the emergence of Coperni
cuss heliocentric model of our solar 
system. Before Christs crucifixion, 
people who later became Christians 
were in the same place as those trying 
to map the movement of the planets via 
a geocentric model.
For these people, it seemed like it 
should work, but in reality was not an 
effective means of explanation.
Once Copernicus moved us to a he
liocentric model, the sun became the 
focal point around which the solar 
system revolved. This allowed for the 
slow discovery of new things about the 
solar system and the earths place in the 
grander scheme of the universe.
With Jesus crucifixion and the emer
gence of Christianity, Christians had 
a basic and fundamental truth with 
Christ serving as the focal point for 
their understanding, a point around 
which to revolve their faith.
As the planets revolve around the 
sun, the planets themselves are ex
posed or illuminated in different ways 
and at different times, and a Christian 
who has his or her center in Christ 
should experience these same types of 
exposure with the intention of garner
ing a better understanding of his place 
in the world and the many wonders that 
comprise life.
The result is instead of having a 
pyramid coming to a point wherein lies 
the answer, everything emanates from 
the answer, as does light from the sun, 
from which millions of unique episodes 
emerge, not necessarily possible to be 
observed or fathomed.
Whether the Gospel of Judas is valid 
or not is immaterial. The fundamental 
truth of Christianity has not changed; 
Christ is still at the center. What can 
change is a persons ability to interpret 
his own place in the makeup of the 
greater scheme.
Even though a wise man thinks he
 can comprehend it, he wont be able to 
find it (Ecclesiastes 8:17). However, it 
is the attempt and the search that take 
him somewhere greater.

(XKifiOAlexandra Kilduff
Earlier this week, I was having a con
versation with a friend of mine who is 
also spending the semester in Washing
ton, D.C. Both of us are heavily involved 
with campus organizations at Carnegie 
Mellon, organizations that benefit from 
working with a strong, active student 
government, and we were disappointed 
to hear about the disastrous state of stu
dent elections. I confided to my friend 
that I hardly expected to see grand 
presidential platforms and heavy voter 
turnout  maybe the fact that student 
government is not as visible and active 
as we would like is because its not meant 
to be. Maybe, I said, we should just lower 
our expectations.
My friends response surprised me. 
Maybe youre just giving in to their ar
gument, he told me. In other words, just 
because student government has, in my 
time at Carnegie Mellon, not taken strong 
initiatives doesnt mean it doesnt have 
that capacity. And if I lower my expecta
tions, then Im not supporting change, 
only stagnation.
His comments certainly got me think
ing. Of course its possible to elect into 
office motivated, powerful leaders. But 
do the candidates themselves realize 
their potential for change?
I hope these are questions that Karl 
Sjogren and Andrea Hamilton are ask
ing themselves. Ive known both Karl and 
Andrea since my first year at CMU, and 
they are both amazing individuals. I ad
mire their work ethic and their interests, 
and I am always impressed at how they 
make efforts to welcome everyone.
Poor voter turnout, a disappointing 
debate, and missed deadlines are lessons 
to be learned for next year, but for right 
now theyre through. Its time for Sjogren 
and Hamilton to focus on what they call 
their vision for the campus and to make 
every concerted effort to follow through 
on their proposals. Since they stressed 
learning about what the campus com
munity wants from them, here are a few 
suggestions to consider:
We all love to talk about improving
communication, but do we ever stop 
to think about what actually means? I 
would love to see the student body presi
dent and vice-president make a point 
of publicizing and attending events not 
only in their own departments, but in all 
colleges; grab some space on Carnegie 
Mellons website; utilize campus media 
organizations; contact the mailing lists 
of organizations who might be interested 
in events they otherwise wouldnt know 
about; and help student groups poster, 
table, and publicize. Also, a comprehen
sive events calendar would be amazing.
Another word we love: diversity. Lets 
have the student body president and 
vice-president really throw their weight 
behind cultural organizations and raise 
awareness. The less-than-lovely truth of 
Carnegie Mellon is that while we hear 
constantly about diversity, certain groups 
of students still feel alienated. There may 
only be a handful of people in the student 
government, but its their prerogative 
and duty to make sure they get to the root 
of all student concerns.
If theres one thing Carnegie Mellon 
seems to lack, its advocacy and educa
tion about social issues. We dont put 
much investment into Pittsburgh, nor do 
we encourage students to participate in 
service or work toward making any kind 
of serious difference in peoples lives. 
Why not? If were so bright, lets use our 
talents to help some people. The SBP and 
SBVP could definitely set an example and 
encourage this kind of involvement.
In his book On Leadership, John W. 
Gardner writes, Most men and women 
go through their lives using no more 
than a fraction  usually a rather small 
fraction  of the potentialities within 
them. Among the untapped capabilities 
are leadership gifts.... We can do better. 
Much, much better. I hope Sjogren and 
Hamilton take this into account as they 
step into their new positions.
I, for one, am going to hold them to 
extremely high expectations, and I have 
faith that they can and will deliver. I look 
forward to seeing what changes they 
make next year.

Carnegie Mellon lacrosse travels to Michigan for the playoffs
Junior Tomo Gibson helped the Tartan offense last weekend by drawing out 
defenders and putting two shots in the back of Ferris States net.
and Dayton went into Saturdays 
game much more relaxed. Both 
teams came into Saturday with 
mutual respect, McMullen said. 
There was less pressure, but it 
was a better, harder-played game 
for both teams.
Saturdays game was an even 
match-up, with Carnegie Mellon 
and Dayton exchanging the lead 
throughout the game. It was a 
good game, back and forth, said 
Stamatopoulos. We pretty much 
dominated possession. But it 
was Dayton who ultimately came 
out on top, winning 12-9.
The game was tight from the 
start. Dayton ended up lead
ing 2-1 after the first quarter. 
Carnegie Mellon came back to tie 
the game to 4-4 at the half. The 
score was 8-7 with the Tartans 
in the lead going into the fourth 
quarter when Dayton scored two 
quick goals to pull ahead, where 
they remained for the rest of the 
game.
Carnegie Mellon sophomore 
Matt Schulz had long goal from 
back on defense to start the 
Tartan offense. Knecht, Adams, 
and Broglie each had two goals. 
Senior Troy Cox found the back 
of the net once and McMullen 
had a goal and won 14 out of
23 faceoffs. Spiegel had 20 saves 
throughout the game.
In the championship game, 
Calvin went on to upset Ferris 
State 14-6, earning them an 
automatic bid into the national 
tournament in Dallas, Texas.
Despite coming in fourth in 
the tournament, four Tartans 
received recognition for their in
dividual performances. Knecht 
was named to All-Conference 
Attack second team, McMullen 
and Cox were named to the AllConference Midfield second 
team, and Schulz received an 
honorable mention to the AllConference Defense second team. 
Stamatopoulos also received the 
co-coach of the year award for 
the conference.
Although the Tartans came 
away from the postseason disap
pointed, Carnegie Mellons first 
year in the CCLA was a success. 
It was a great season, DAndrea 
said. The quality of the games 
and the practice schedule were 
at a level that the team has never 
seen since Ive been here, but we 
responded to every challenge.
[The weekend] was really 
disappointing, McMullen said, 
Were taking it personally, and 
were already thinking about next 
year.
Editors Note: Christian DAndrea 
is a staff member at The Tartan.
Carnegie Mellons loss paired 
them against Dayton in Saturdays 
consolation game, a match-up 
that Carnegie Mellon had been 
predicting. We knew we were 
going to be playing Dayton, said 
McMullen. We just thought it 
was going to be in the champion
ship.
Without the pressure of a 
championship hanging over 
their heads, Carnegie Mellon
Sophomore Zach Teeple (white jersey) had 11 goals and two assists in the 
regular season. He added two goals to his total over the weekend.
LACROSSE, from A14
DAndrea. We only had six play
ers coming off the bench at any 
given time; this hurt us more as 
games wore on.
It was a night for upsets; earlier 
in the evening the undefeated 
and lOth-ranked University of 
Dayton was defeated by 17thranked Calvin College in the 
other semifinal game.

GOLF, from A14
just pop it out, he said. It was 
probably like the best shot I ever 
hit, especially under that kind of 
pressure. I popped it out, put it on 
the green to like 20, 25 feet.
After Simone and Goodridge 
made pars on that hole, the two 
matched each other birdie for 
birdie on playoff holes two and 
three, then par for par on the 
fourth hole.
It basically just turned into 
a dogfight, just who could sur
vive longer, Simone said. Its 
tiring enough to play 18 holes 
in a tournament when youre 
concentrating for four straight 
hours  youre walking, youre 
carrying your bag, youre trying 
to steer your ball around a course
which is pretty tight, pretty dif
ficult. After like the third hole 
we were both fairly mentally ex
hausted.
By sinking a bogey on the parthree fifth playoff hole, Simone 
prevailed and won the second in
dividual conference title in school 
history.
Hes been a great kid for the 
team. Hes been a great player for 
us, and one of the probably great
est players ever here at Carnegie 
Mellon, said Erdelyi.
Erdelyi and who assistant 
coach Joe Rudman won confer
ence co-coaching staff of the year 
honors. It was just a great way to 
cap a career.
Simone, who was named to the 
All-conference first team, real
ized the significance of the win.
Its a special feeling especially 
being a senior in probably my last 
tournament.
The Tartans had been flirting 
with a spot in the national tour
nament all spring season, but 
the fourth-place finish will most 
likely deny the team a spot in the 
post-season.
However, based on the experi
ence the younger players gained 
and the depth of next years ros
ter, the future remains bright for 
Carnegie Mellons golf program 
despite losing the strong play and 
leadership of seniors Simone and 
Straub.
I think this program is going in 
the right direction, Smith said.

Tartan mens lacrosse team 
sees first CCLA postseason
memSI
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Last weekend, Carnegie 
Mellons mens lacrosse team 
made its first appearance in 
the Central Collegiate Lacrosse 
Association (CCLA) regional 
playoffs, which took place in East 
Grand Rapids, Mich. Out of the 
10 teams in Carnegie Mellons 
division, four made it into the 
postseason.
In the regular season, Carnegie 
Mellon went 4-1 in division play 
 good enough to secure them 
a spot in the playoffs, along with 
the University of Dayton (5-0), 
Ferris State University (4-1), and 
Calvin College (3-2). 
On Friday night, Carnegie 
Mellon faced Ferris State 
University (Mich.) in the 
semifinals. With high expec
tations, the Tartans failed to 
overcome the pressure and fell 
to the Bulldogs 14-20. Weve 
responded to pressure pretty well 
for the most part all season, said 
junior Rick McMullen, but not 
this time.
The game was evenly 
matched, said head coach 
Anthony Stamatopoulos. It was 
a big upset; Ferris played very, 
very well.
Leading the Tartan offense 
was senior Alex Knecht, who had 
four goals throughout the game. 
Sophomore Matt Adams added 
four points with three goals and 
an assist. Junior Chris Broglie had
two goals and an assist. Junior 
Tomo Gibson and sophomore 
Zach Teeple each had a pair of 
goals. McMullen rounded out the 
Tartan offense with a goal and an 
assist. McMullen also won 17 out 
of 28 faceoffs. First-year goalie 
Jake Spiegel had 25 saves during 
the game.
Despite a strong offense, the 
Tartan defense was unable to shut 
down the Bulldogs. We had trou
ble containing Ferris shooters, 
said senior Christian DAndrea. 
In particular, Ferris State sopho
more Austin Freshour, a recent 
transfer from Butler University (a 
Division I school) racked up nine 
goals for the Bulldogs.
It was a first line defensive 
breakdown, Stamatopoulos said. 
We won almost every faceoff, 
but they got pretty much all of the 
ground balls.
After the first quarter, the score 
was 4-3, the Tartans only trailing 
by one, but the Bulldogs widened 
the gap, scoring seven goals to the 
Tartans five and going into halftime with an 11-8 lead. Carnegie 
Mellons lack of depth got them 
into trouble late in the game as 
fatigue lead to 12 penalties com
pared to Ferris States eight. We 
got a lot of penalties towards the 
end, said McMullen. We were 
just so tired we got desperate, so 
they scored more, so we got more 
desperate.
Most teams in the playoffs 
were about twice our size, said

Doug Fricker
With the school year coming to 
a close, I could take a moment to 
reflect on the past year in sports, 
but Id prefer to look to the fu
ture. In two weeks, well all be 
going our separate ways for the 
summer, and therell be a pleth
ora of exciting sporting events 
to watch from May to August, so 
heres a preview of what to look 
forward to this summer in the 
wide world of sports.
The National Basketball 
League (NBA) and National 
Hockey League (NHL) playoffs 
are currently in progress, but 
they seem to drag on forever. 
If youve been too busy to pay 
attention, dont worry  tune 
in next month and you wont be 
too late.
The Spurs and the Pistons are 
both leading their respective 
series, so a rematch of last years 
NBA finals could be in the cards, 
but I wouldnt count out Kobe
The U.S. soccer team is looking for wins at this summers World Cup.
and the Lakers or Shaq and the 
Heat just yet.
There is nothing more dra
matic than an NHL playoff 
game in overtime. With the 
sudden-death format, ties are 
no longer an option. There 
have already been four games 
that have reached double over
time this year, with two in the 
Detroit-Edmonton series. The 
Ottawa Senators and the New 
Jersey Devils are looking strong 
in the East, while the West is up 
for grabs, as the best team in the 
regular season, Detroit, is on the 
brink of elimination.
This Saturday is the Kentucky 
Derby, with Brother Derek, 
Lawyer Ron, and Barbaro pegged 
as the favorites leading up to the 
race at Churchill Downs. Expect 
a fast start from these horses 
with strange names in a race 
that will be attended by almost 
150,000 people.
With June comes soccers 
World Cup. Germany is hosting 
the tournament; matches will 
start June 9 and last for a month. 
Defending champion Brazil will 
look to repeat after defeating 
Germany to win the World Cup 
four years ago. The U.S. made it 
to the quarterfinals in 2002, and 
they hope to equal or improve 
on that performance this year. 
The U.S. is in a tough group
with the Czech Republic, Italy, 
and Ghana. Only the top two 
teams from each group advance, 
so every game carries major im
plications.
Tennis fans will get their fill 
as the French Open takes place 
in early June with Wimbledon 
following in early July. Roger 
Federer looks to win his fourth 
straight Wimbledon singles title. 
Last year, Federer overpowered 
Andy Roddick, winning the final 
in straight sets. On the wom
ens side, Venus Williams had 
her back against the wall against 
Lindsay Davenport, only to per
severe and come from match 
points down to defeat Davenport 
and win her third Wimbledon 
title.
The Tour de France runs from 
July 1 to July 23; the big news is 
that somebody with a last name 
other than Armstrong will win 
this year. Lance Armstrong has 
won the past seven Tours, but 
he announced after last years 
competition that he would not 
race in another. Armstrongs feat 
is truly remarkable, but his re
tirement gives everyone else an 
actual chance at winning.
Pittsburgh will host the Major 
League Baseball All-Star game 
on July 11 this year, which will 
mark the first time all season 
that two good teams will be play

ing in PNC Park at the same 
time.
The ballpark, overlooking 
Pittsburghs beautiful skyline, 
has been ranked as one of the 
best parks in baseball; unfor
tunately, it usually doesnt get 
much recognition because the 
Pirates havent had a winning 
season since 1992.
Lastly, as if coming back to 
school in August isnt enough, 
weve got the Little League World 
Series spanning August 18-27 
in Williamsport, Pa. It gives 11- 
and 12-year-olds with squeaky 
voices the opportunity to be
come famous for a short time as 
they all vie for the coveted World 
Series championship. Its a relief 
to see athletes playing for the 
sheer love of the game, instead 
of for money or glory  as is 
evident at times in professional 
sports today 
Consider yourself prepared for 
the upcoming months now; the 
sun never seems to set on the 
sports world, and this summer 
will be no exception. Whether 
youre a diehard fan or just a 
casual spectator, there is some
thing for everyone in the months 
to come.

Screenwriter's find an outlet
Carnegie Mellon students
At Carnegie Mellon, talent doesn't like to keep 
to itself. From drama performances in Purnell 
to student art on display at The Frame, theres 
always something to see. And despite the wealth 
of creative outlets already available, students 
are constantly finding new ways to express 
themselves. Whats the latest in campus artistry? 
Film. Stop by McConomy on Friday to see two 
movies written, directed, and produced by 
Carnegie Mellon students.
It all started in the English department. Professor 
Sharon Dilworth picked six students from her 
screenwriting classes to participate in a year
long film project. "I felt like the opportunity just 
fell into my hands," said junior English major Alie 
Kolb, one of the chosen writers. Dilworth divided 
the students into two teams, which were each 
charged with the ambitious goal of creating a 
screenplay.
The first step in the process was selecting a 
pitch. Each student proposed an idea to Dilworth, 
who chose the two with the most potential for the 
screen. From there, the team members worked 
together to create a treatment, a detailed outline 
of the story that precedes the creation of a script. 
After receiving feedback on their treatments, it 
was time for the first draft.
Sometimes it felt like we didnt know what 
we were doing, said Kolb. Though the writing 
process was difficult, good team chemistry and 
respect for each others ideas kept it from being 
impossible. For Kolbs team, whose film is called 
Gmace, the primary challenge was in settling on 
a well-defined idea. Their script started out as 
the story of two fallen angels, one of whom was 
unfortunate enough to be in love with a demon.
But the initial concept is nowhere to be seen in 
the final screenplay, which turned into a murder 
mystery about a reporter. It might seem like 
Kolbs team entirely abandoned their original 
idea, but Kolb insists that the evolution of Gmace 
was only the result of a lot of little changes.
The other team found it difficult to write 
consistently due to the constraint of multiple 
authors. Three writers is about the max," said 
senior English major Brian Leahy, who worked to 
create the screenplay for RuLtes uf Wl^ Hluwems.
In the beginning, Leahys team created a card 
for every intended scene and divided them 
at random among the three writers. Though 
efficient, this method wasn't exactly practical. 
None of the transitions would work, said Leahy. 
Eventually, his team settled on a routine in which 
the writers took turns taking the script for the 
night, during which time they would both edit 
and add content.
RuLtes uf Wl^ Hluwems chronicles four strangers 
in Pittsburgh trying to make it downtown on a 
day when the buses aren't running. Labeling it a
make their own movies
"dramatic comedy," Leahy compared his script to 
Hemms BLellem's Day Off in its style. The idea was 
definitely practical, especially since both of the 
crews were confined by their location.
Leahy was less than enthusiastic about shooting 
in Pittsburgh: We had to," he said matter-offactly. "Pittsburghs really pushing to get filming 
done here and its not gonna work, he added. In 
Hollywood, a crew would be much more likely to 
use a studio set of the 'Burgh, perhaps traveling 
to Canada when in need of a more realistic 
environment.
Kolb, a Pittsburgh native, did not see the city as 
such an obstacle. We had some good locations, 
said Kolb. Her crew filmed at one of Pittsburghs 
Pamelas diners and the Forward Lanes bowling 
alley in Squirrel Hill. For both teams, Pittsburgh 
provided the entirety of the films' casts. In 
Leahys film, three of the four starring actors are 
Pittsburgh residents, while the fourth is a student 
at one of the citys other colleges.
All six of the writers are current Carnegie Mellon 
undergrads. Originally a psychology major, Leahy 
said that when he entered the creative writing
 program he knew that his primary interest was 
screenwriting. He recommended Dilworth's 
Survey of Forms: Screenwriting class, in addition 
to the Screenwriting Workshop, which he's taken 
twice.
Kolb came to Carnegie Mellon intending to major 
in creative writing, though did not discover her 
fondness for screenwriting until taking Dilworths 
class. Kolb admitted that originally she only 
signed up for Survey of Forms: Screenwriting 
to avoid the poetry section. Unlike fiction and 
poetry, Kolb pointed out that most students are 
not exposed to screenwriting in high school. Still 
a junior, Kolb plans to go through the process 
again next year with a brand-new script.
This is the first year anything like this has 
happened at Carnegie Mellon, and so far the 
project has been a success. For Leahy, his most 
rewarding experience to date was witnessing the 
table read for his script. After casting, all the 
actors assembled to run through the screenplay 
aloud for the first time. Leady was impressed 
when they delivered the lines he had written with 
immediate intensity. It was just really cool to be 
in the room, he said.

A survey taken by Carnegie Tech addressed the

the most popular response was housewife. Who

use toasters and vacuums?
Bruce Carter, a CFA professor, had a display at 
the Hokkaido grint Association Exhibition in Japan. 
His work was controversial, as it depicted the 
experiences of victims of the Warsaw ghetto and 
Wounded Knee. The Japanese shunned his work 
because of the strong artistic commentary, and in 
response Carter stated, If one generation does 
not pass this [message] along to the next one, 
theyve committed a great injustice. Im trying to 
do it through my artwork. To me its too much risk 
to assume that someone else is taking care of it. 
Obviously, his heart was in the work.

published a 'Top Ten DORK Pick-Up Lines Popular

things never change. Or not.
When students were asked, How will you survive 
the last few weeks of school? the responses 
ranged from Having no fun" to Loading up on 
Mountain Dew to Im not going to survive  Ill 
live here forever." Again, its good to know some 
things never change. But now we know who that 
person is camped out in the back of Hunt...
On April 10 it was discovered by officials at the 
Tepper School of Business that an online intruder 
had broken into a number of computers. It was 
estimated that as many as 6000 students personal 
information had been compromised. Students were 
notified campuswide on April 20. Some speculated 
that the delay was partly because SquirrelMail kept 
logging the administration out every time they tried 
to notify the student body.

The 2006 Russian Film 
Symposium will show films 
that address issues of race 
and identity.

Russian Film Symposium hits Pittsburgh
Issues of race in Russia are theme for this years symposium
The annual Russian Film Symposium has arrived. Through 
Saturday, students interested in Russian history, film, and 
sociology will be able to see several Russian films daily at the 
Cathedral of Learning and in the evening at the Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers' Melwood Screening Room. The films include 
classics of early Soviet cinema from the late 1920s and 1930s, 
and also several new films from 2005. The symposiums theme 
this year is "White Russian, Black Russian: Race and Etlmicity 
in Russian Cinema."
Recent years have seen racism on the rise in Russia. The Sova 
Center, a Russian think tank, reported 28 racially-motivated 
murders in 394 attacks across Russia in 2005. Neo-Nazi 
skinhead groups often claim responsibility for the attacks in 
Russia, which include the victimization of ethnic minorities, 
tourists, and foreign students. Skinhead activity has recently 
been on the rise outside of Russia, as well.
Racism in Russia has a complicated, centuries-old origin. 
Russia has always been a multinational state  the USSR 
was made up of 15 different republics in Europe and Asia. 
Many had to be violently brought into the union, giving rise 
to tension. Within the republics, there are also many ethnic 
and racial sub-groups. The Russian people were perceived to 
be favored above all others, and of course most local Soviet 
leaders of importance were Russians. This favoritism created 
much friction, which persists to this day. The Communists 
had been suspicious of nationalism as a rival to their MarxistLeninist ideology and suppressed nationalist feelings, local 
customs, traditions, and culture.
Though the phenomenon persists in both countries, the 
issue of race in Russia is different from racism in America.
The Russian Film Symposium's director, Vladimir Padunov, 
a member of the University of Pittsburghs Slavic studies 
department as well as associate director of the film program 
there, said, "Racism is not reflected upon in Russia. It is still 
seen as natural." The Moscow Times reported Friday on racist 
websites in Russia and the authorities' efforts to crack down
on them. One site posted a "Manual of Street Terror, which 
described how to quickly turn ethnic targets into porridge 
on the streets.
The consequence of this lack of reflection is that racist groups 
in Russia still act out violently against peoples of other 
races. We reflected about racism in America around the civil 
rights movement, so its more insidious now," Padunov said. 
American racism now occurs more subtly, but the attitude 
is still pervasive in American society. If you are swarthy in 
Moscow, a cop will walk up to you and ask for your papers. 
Send a black person into Squirrel Hill, bet you they get 
stopped, Padunov said.
The persuasiveness of film has not been used to reflect on 
racism in Russia. Films show how ethnicities are represented 
and what is taken for granted in that portrayal that produces 
a stereotype. How does that validate already existing 
stereotypes?" Padunov said.
The Russian Film Symposium is unique among film festivals. 
The discussions and introductions which accompany the 
films will not solely focus on the issue of race; the symposium 
also examines the films from an artistic and cinematic 
viewpoint. Padunov described the symposium: It uses a 
national cinema to address a bunch of interdisciplinary 
issues, some of which are Slavic, film, sociology, anthropology, 
[and] music.
The symposium will have numerous guests, including 
faculty from the College of William and Mary, the Russian 
State Humanities University, and UCLA. The symposium 
was put together by faculty and graduate students at Pitt in 
collaboration with the Pittsburgh Filmmakers. A full schedule 
of the films can be found at www.rusfilm.pitt.edu/2006/ 
schedule.htm.

Primal worship challenges intellectual
Drama schools Equus forces audiences to reflect
Theater performances will often seek to provide audiences 
enlightenment or entertainment, but last week, the School 
of Drama directly confronted, challenged, and disturbed 
the audiences who entered the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio 
Theater.
The small space with audiences on all four sides of the stage 
was home to the production of Equus, a controversial play by 
Peter Shaffer. Laura Gross, a graduate student in the drama 
schools directing program, directed the production. She 
presented this as her graduate thesis, the hallmark of her 
studies at Carnegie Mellon.
Equus originally premiered in 1973 in the National Theatre at 
the Old Vic in London. It received a 1975 Tony Award for Best 
Play, and in 1977 it became a feature-length movie starring 
Richard Burton and Peter Firth that was nominated for three 
Oscars. Shaffer went on to write the hit play Amadeus, which 
became the popular film starring Tom Hulce.
Set in a fictional psychiatric hospital, the play tells the story 
of Martin Dysart, a child psychiatrist played by senior drama 
major Anderson Davis, who analyzes Alan Strang (junior 
drama major Jeffrey Omura). Alan has blinded four horses 
with a metal spike before the play began, and the plot of 
Equus revolves around the detective-like search for the 
source of his problems. Ultimately, Dysart finds that Alan 
idolizes the horses and, to do his job, must destroy the teens 
intense and unnatural passions. Alans crime is motivated 
by an unsettling amalgamation of situations. Is it possible to 
pinpoint one cause for what he did? Shaffer says no, but one 
can see how different Alans passion is from the boring dayto-day movements of modem society.
Gross, who graduated from Bennington College in Vermont 
with a degree in theater and psychology, knew she wanted to 
direct Equus for years. She said that the powerful script and 
message amazed her. In her words, it kicked my ass."
Its about the idea of having to destroy the extraordinary 
to become ordinary. The whole idea broke my heart, said 
Gross. Our lives are primarily ordinary, and when we see the 
extraordinary, we have to destroy it and make it fit in.
Equus challenges audience members to re-evaluate their own 
sense of worship. Dysart wrestles with his patients passions 
and his own bland life, and his moving monologues that 
describe that inner battle between duty and desire invite his 
on-lookers to reflect on those struggles within themselves.
The play does not characterize Alans primal passions as an 
anathema; in fact, it seeks to redefine the concept of "primal 
altogether and juxtapose it with modem worship of brandname consumerism.
This is the unsettling tension between the rational and 
the irrational, and Gross production explores that tension 
very well. J. Patrick Adair, a graduate student in scene 
design, sought to create a theatrical space that encouraged 
audience members to reflect on themselves. For instance, he 
suggested the four-sided audience setup to foster that selfconsciousness.
It's confrontational because of the idea of this boy having this 
unnatural relationship with a horse and the violence
that comes out of that, Adair said. You come ... face-to-face 
with that in a really small space.... You cant help but feel 
uncomfortable at times."
For the basic layout of the stage, Adair placed rigid, 
geometric shapes in four comers around a circular stage 
with hay flowing out of its bottom. The representation of the 
intersection between the animalistic and the intellectual 
complemented the action on stage, which Gross staged in 
order to further elicit audience response to the tension.
Gross led a strong team of actors who propel the sensual 
rawness of the action on stage. With the character of 
Alan Strang, Omura used fierce body movements and an 
impressive array of facial expressions. Spit flew from his 
mouth as he forcefully confronted other characters, and 
even if his accent slipped a bit, Omura's performance of the 
untamed and brutal young boy who goes from flippantly 
singing commercial jingles to cowering, naked, in Dysarts 
arms was poignantly provocative.
As the representation of intellects battle with the primal, the 
mental thrust and parry of Alan and Dysart in the hospital 
required a lot of the two actors who had to perform for an 
audience all around them. Davis has had an immensely 
successful senior year in the School of Drama, and his 
performance of the troubled psychiatrist never faltered. With 
amazing dexterity, Davis rapidly jumped from the role of 
cunning doctor to the role of bitter husband sick of normalcy.
"There is now, in my mouth, this sharp chain  and it never 
comes out, Dysart says at one point. Davis delivered these 
difficult monologues to an audience stunned and disturbed 
by his anguish, for his attempt to "account for the archetypal 
god Equus is a mirror of the worlds attempt to contain 
passion.
The horses, turned into deities by Alan, carried with them 
much of the plays creepiness. The light and sound team 
signaled the presence of the horses with a remarkable 
atmosphere of sinister dimness. The actors who played the 
horses had to go into strength training to wear the hoof-like 
shoes in performance, and their hard work showed. Gross 
decided to have the four horses enter from the four entrances 
to the theatre, and they slowly put on their masks each time 
they came in. It was a tasteful, hair-raising weirdness.
The plays rapid shift between times and scenes demanded a 
well-coordinated ensemble performance with a strong grasp 
of the dialogue, and Gross and her team decided to use as few 
props as possible to let the play's script speak for itself. Three 
wood pieces were all the actors had to work with, and they 
thought that was just fine.
I applaud her for that, said Michelle Wong, a junior acting 
major who played Hester, a magistrate. [The props] are 
all very appropriate. The script can stand alone, and to put 
anything in its way is a disservice. Wong said the actors 
could relish in Shaffer's words and allow themselves and the 
audience to enjoy them.
I wanted to rip tears out of people, said Gross. Her 
production of Equus was a transformative and moving 
experience that engaged the audience and invited them to 
consider the ramifications of appropriating the extraordinary 
and to consider the definition of ordinary.
Why would this production have a place in a university?
At Carnegie Mellon, where students hope to be more than 
ordinary, the primal rarely meets the academic, but maybe 
 Shaffer meant for Equus to challenge that.

Big Als Metal Shop
Summer shows offer something for every metal fan
Dear Readers,
This being the last column of the semester, I want to mention 
a few of the nice things coming our way this summer. Of 
course, there is Ozzfest. The annual metal day camp hits town 
in July, and you can expect yet another rock-hard second 
stage. My favorites, like Strapping Young Lad, Full Blown 
Chaos (FBC), and A Life Once Lost all open for the mighty 
Black Label Society. With Ozzy taking it easy this summer, it 
seems Zakk is taking it in stride by playing the sweaty, sun
burnt crowds earlier on and fitting in a few extra cold ones 
before nightfall. Or so Im guessing.
In the few times I witnessed the fury of FBC, I stood wayyyyy 
in the back. Yes, I am old, and I know a good thing when I see 
it. Musically, FBC comes from the same school of hardcore 
that spawned Hatebreed, Sworn Enemy, Madball... you get 
the picture. Namely, an equal love of Cro-Mags and Slayer,
Bad Brains and Pantera, DRI and Sepultura. It all makes for 
compelling music and frightening circle pits. With Hatebreed 
graduating to the Main Stage, its nice to see them blazing 
the path for bands like Sworn Enemy and FBC. With a dense 
set of bands, all competing for tour slots (and your attention), 
the cohesiveness of this scene never ceases to amaze me. The 
thought of a hardcore band on Ozzfest a few years ago, when, 
say, Korn or Limp Bizkit were headlining, was far-fetched. 
Now, FBC  with one awesome album under their belt and 
another on the way this summer  has a serious platform to 
offer an alternative to lame music.
Then again, if Ozzfest isn't your thing and you crave a little 
Slayer in your diet, you can check out the Unholy Alliance 
tour in Cleveland at the end of June. With Lamb of God, 
Children of Bodom, and others, this is the ber-thrash metal 
re\nval youve been waiting for. That this summer will also see 
Slayers first album under the original line-up since Seasons 
in The Abyss is also noteworthy. There is something about 
Dave Lombardos drumming that sets him above all else.
That almost jazz-like touch, combined with speed that laid 
down the backbone of Reign in Blood and South of Heaven, 
is incomparable. In the time he was away, Dave worked with 
avant-garde artists like John Zom and Mike Patton among 
others, and the result was far from ordinary rock; how that 
translates back into Slayer remains to be seen.
If you're still not convinced, then I suggest the Sounds of 
the Underground tour, also hitting Cleveland this summer. 
Coming off the stellar Kill, Cannibal Corpse have inched death 
metal slightly beyond its tight existence. Slowing down the 
jackhammer attack for impact works very well on this album, 
and it doesnt lose the aggression inherent in Corpse. Since 
they headline this years fest, you'll get a chance to compare 
the old and the new.
Finally, before classes let out, two shows of interest hit Mr. 
Small's. First, on Wednesday, is Brave the Fire opening for 
Every Time I Die. As I mentioned a couple weeks ago, there 
is a buzz building for Brave the Fire locally, mostly due to 
their work ethic and musicianship. If youre curious about the
local Pittsburgh metal scene, this is as good a place as any to 
start. Saturday night brings Arch Enemy and Clevelands own 
Chimaira, a perfect pairing in my opinion. Take Mike Arnotts 
honed guitar sound and put it up beside the best of the New 
Wave of American Heavy Metal, and Chimaira is certainly a 
contender.
Its all out there for you to explore  this year is shaping up 
to be a defining year for the scene in this town. Please go out 
and support!
I would like to dedicate this article to Ronaldo and the Selecao 
Brasileiro for this years World Cup. Much respect to Ronnie 
for disregarding the experts" who say hes off his game. And 
to all the pundits who doubt the Beautiful Team will bring 
home the Hexa this year, lets see who raises the Jules Rimet 
trophy come July.
Till next time, 
much love and respect.

Full Blown Chaos is one of 
the bands opening at this 
year's Ozzfest. You can look 
forward to a new album by

Bringing literature and art to the city of Steel
Pittsburgh ranks as eighth most literate city and as third-best mid-sized arts city
Pittsburgh has long been known as "Steel City, but new city 
rankings suggest it might be better referred to as the 'Burgh 
of Books or the Area of Art. Pittsburgh was recently ranked 
the eighth most literate city in the United States and the 
third best mid-size city for art.
In a study conducted by Central Connecticut State 
University in 2005, Pittsburgh was ranked the eighth most 
literate city out of 69 ranked. But Pittsburghers shouldnt feel 
bad that Seattle came in in first place: It rains so much there 
that nobody has anything better to do than read anyways!
The rankings from this study were based on a number of 
factors. First off, researchers took into account the number 
of bookstores, libraries, newspapers, and periodicals in each 
city. They also looked at Internet usage and the educational 
level of residents. Of course, the fact that Pittsburgh is home 
to more than 60,000 college students from the University 
of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne 
University, Carlow University, and several other smaller 
institutions must be taken into account when looking at 
these ratings. Pittsburgh may have an inflated number of 
newspapers since there are many colleges that publish their 
own newspapers.
Interestingly enough, 2005 was the first year that this study 
included an Internet resources factor "to better gauge the 
expansion of literacy to online media, explained Central 
Connecticut State University president John Miller in a 
letter published online. The inclusion of this factor probably 
helped boost Pittsburghs ratings since the major colleges in
the area all have extensive online library resources. Thanks, 
Cameo, for making our city a better place to live.
Our ranking might not seem like a big deal, but this 
annual study has had profound effects on some cities in 
the past. "The value of this study, I believe, lies less in the 
absolute accuracy of the rank orders and far more in what 
communities do with the information. It is heartening to 
see a city like El Paso, which did not rank well on last year's 
edition, launch a citywide literacy campaign, where, among 
other community initiatives, 'Read El Paso Read' distributed 
some 95,000 books to community members at various events 
designed to encourage literacy, explained Miller on his 
universitys website.
Unfortunately, not everyone in Pittsburgh exemplifies the 
love of books implied by this survey. Senior math major 
Orest Sopka jokingly noted, "Does their literature contain 
the word 'yinz? Sopka also joked, "Aint need to read good 
to know numbers. I will be pulling more than 60K next year; 
that wouldn't have happened through books.
Echoing this sentiment, Preeti Farooque, another senior 
math major, said, Honestly, I think CMU stunts peoples 
literacy. Certainly, heavy course loads and time-consuming 
extracurricular activities put a damper on students 
free time, but it is unlikely that going to college actually 
decreases literacy rates.
Students from other majors had differing opinions on literacy 
in Pittsburgh. Simi Singh, a junior ethics, history, and public
policy major, said that she reads magazines and other books 
during vacations and outside of class.
Pittsburgh was also recently ranked the third best mid
sized city in the United States for its art exhibits. In a poll 
conducted in the magazine American Style, Buffalo, N.Y., 
came in first place, followed by Albuquerque, N.M. Only last 
year, Pittsburgh was in 10th place in the same survey.
What caused the ranking to improve? According to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, this improvement in ranking is 
due to an unlikely source: glass. Glass has been gaining 
attention in the city lately  Pittsburgh will even be home 
to the annual Glass Art Society conference next July. The 
buzz from this conference has already had a positive impact 
on art exhibits in Pittsburgh because "anywhere that 
conference goes brings dozens of exhibitions with it. The 
Pittsburgh Glass Center has been instrumental in that and 
has really focused on it, reported Christine Kloostra, a writer 
for American Style, in an interview with the Pittsburgh PostGazette.
While not everyone on campus has a high regard for books 
and art, Pittsburgh's seems to be on the rise, getting a lot 
of positive attention that may translate into even better 
rankings next year.

Amlie
Wednesday, May 3 
1012:30
If you havent seen this movie, 
youve either been living under a 
rock or thought you were so super
indie-cultured that you were above 
obscure-turned-popular movies. 
Well listen here, buddy: Amlie is 
one of the most beautiful movies 
ever made. Not only is the color 
brilliant throughout, the story is 
touching, and the acting is superb. 
A euphoric soundtrack by Yann 
Tiersen moves the film along. This 
is the movie that launched Audrey 
Tautou (Sophie Neveu in the 
upcoming Da Vinci Code) into the 
spotlight. Go see it this Wednesday 
on the almost-big screen and get a 
little bit of your dignity back.
Match Point
Thursday, May 4 
7:301012:30
Match Point is a Woody Allen film 
that makes up in drama what it 
misses in Woody Allen comedy.
The story is not too original: A 
guy (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has 
to choose between love and lust, 
wealth and mediocrity, and Emily 
Mortimer and Scarlett Johansson. 
He spends the whole movie figuring 
himself out and leaving the rest 
up to chance. That being said, 
it is well written and well shot in 
classic Woody Allen fashion, and 
the characters are deeply and 
darkly developed. Speaking of 
developed... Scarlett Johansson is 
a good actress.
Munich
Friday, May 5 
101
Steven Spielbergs latest piece isnt 
about aliens or robots or sarcastic 
archaeologists or even Tom Hanks. 
No, in fact, Munich is about the 
aftermath of the terrorism that took 
place at the 1972 Olympics. Eleven 
Israeli athletes were killed in Munich 
just days before the games started 
that year, and this movie tells an 
inspired by a true story tale about 
a team of spies and assassins that 
the Israeli government employs to 
get revenge on the terrorists. It was 
nominated for five Oscars, so if you 
want a touch of culture on your last 
day of class, check it out.
Editors Note: The student-made 
film Routes of Wild Flowers will be 
shown at 7 pm.
Underworld: Evolution
Saturday, May 6 
81012
Underworld came out in 2003, 
and it was immediately met with... 
pretty much nothing. It was 
forgettable and sort of generic, 
but at the same time, who doesnt 
love Kate Beckinsale in skin
tight leather? Also, vampires and 
werewolves are fun. In Underworld: 
Evolution, Kate Beckinsale the 
vampire must team up with Scott 
Speedman the half-werewolf-5halfvampire to defeat a crazy new, 
hyper-evolved hybrid of vampires 
and werewolves and uncover the 
secret history behind the birth of 
their species. Oh, and the bad 
guy has wings. Its a good time, 
especially for just a dollar. And no 
one will judge you if you just want 
to see a little leather.
Night Watch
Sunday, May 7 
81012
More vampiric love comes to 
McConomy. Night Watch, the first 
in a trilogy of Russian fantasy films 
that is still in production, is about 
the forces of light that keep the 
forces of dark in check at night. Its 
all very complicated and more than 
a bit ridiculous, and it does, indeed, 
require reading a lot of subtitles. But 
its worth seeing the movie that has 
toppled every Russian box-office 
record. Also, you can talk to your 
friends for hours afterwards about 
just what the hell was going on.

The lost campus
Henry Hombostel's 1906 revision of the campus plan (below) 
included four towers, the largest of which was where today's 
Hamerschlag Hall tower stands (inset). None of these towers 
were ever built, and it took several years before a very 
different-looking tower was built atop Machinery Hall.

Porter Hall and Henry Hombostels forgotten buildings
F by Greg Prichard [ Contributing Editor J
On Friday, Carnegie Mellon University and its department 
of civil and environmental engineering held a ceremony at 
Porter Hall to commemorate the building's centennial. It was 
an unusual acknowledgment of campus history, but it was 
appropriate, considering Porter is the first building on campus 
to pass the century mark.
The ceremony was a mix of historical recognition and 
Disney World-style showmanship. After a reception in a civil 
engineering department lab, a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
took place at Porters Frew Street entrance, with remarks 
from University president Jared Cohon, H&SS dean John 
P. Lehoczky, and professor Pradeep Khosla of electrical and 
computer engineering. The crowd, consisting mostly of 
civil engineering students, was soon joined by a likeness of 
Andrew Carnegie, brought to the site via horSe and buggy. A 
group photo was taken to simulate the large class pictures of 
the early 1900s, and the ceremony was continued in Gregg 
HaH.
After "Camegies remarks about his life experiences, school 
of architecture professor Charles Rosenblum addressed the
audience about the historical influence of Henry Hombostel 
and the architectural importance of the usually overlooked 
Porter Hall. Rosenblum detailed many aspects of Hombostels 
work, from other campus buildings to. competition entries to 
bridges. It was the combination of Hombostels "Beaux Arts 
training and his strong engineering background that made his 
designs unique, Rosenblum said. Examples of this styling can 
be found in Porter's wrought iron lighting fixtures. They are 
ornate and very distinctive, yet also industrial in appearance.
What Could Have Been
Though much attention is being given to Porter Hall this year, 
few may realize that the building was just the beginning of 
a grand campus plan, one that was only partially executed. 
Upon winning the campus design competition, Hombostel 
continued to refine his building designs for the school to fit 
the fluctuating budget and needs of the school. His original 
design was nearly perfect in its aesthetic unity, layout, and 
scale, yet the funds for creating such a grand campus were 
limited. It was therefore logical to make the first building on 
campus act as not only adequate educational space but also 
as an appropriate entrance to the school. The Frew Street 
entrance was the first focal center of the school and was
used for class pictures, inspiring the re-creation taken during , 
Fridays ceremony. i
Since the redesign of Porter Hall  then called the School of ;
Applied Industries  changed the character of his overall ;
design, Hombostel rethought the entire rest of the campus, i
His next revision included a number of new features, most j 
notably a large tower reaching down into Junction Hollow on ; 
the current site of Hamerschlag Halls tower. This tower would] 
have served as one the campuss most prominent features < 
and also as the schools main power plant. Two smaller towers i 
would have flanked the main tower, approximately where i 
the entrances of Wean and the northwest side of Porter Hall j 
are today. A fourth tower would have gone where todays ]
CFA building stands as part of what Hombostel called the ] 
Museum and Auditorium in the plan. In the ravine adjoining^ 
the school where Newell-Simon Hall stands today, Hombostel ] 
proposed an athletic stadium.
Another notable feature of this plan was the Womens School, i
which would have had its own complex of buildings and ]
quad. This idea was modified drastically that same year, as ]
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall was built in the general i
vicinity of the proposed quad. ;

---------------------------------------------------

According to later designs, Margaret Morrison Hall was 
never completed the way Hornbostel wanted it. The west 
side of the building was extended dramatically a few years 
after the original portion was built, but Hornbostel intended 
an extension equal in size to the front portion to be attached 
to the rear of the building. This new rear wing would have 
included a side rotunda mirroring the existing one, still an 
architectural curiosity today. On the other side of the building, 
dnext to today's "Donner Ditch, Hornbostel wanted to create a 
grand entryway, which would have relegated the impressive
3 rotunda that we are all familiar with into a simple side 
entrance. Needless to say, funds for this huge project were 
impossible to come by, even from Carnegie himself. Things 
hardly change over a hundred years; a project to add a new 
modem-style east wing to Margaret Morrison has been in the 
jworks for years, but has been put off because priorities have 
been reananged for larger projects such as the Gates Center.
Another building that Hornbostel  and the school  
considered essential to the campus was an administration 
building. One design that made its way through the time's 
prominent architectural journals was a huge building with 
columns and statuary. It was intended to face Frew Street 
and act as a main gateway to the campus. When it became 
possible for an administration building to be constructed, 
its execution was about one-quarter the size of this design.I
 Today it is the library-facing end of Baker Hall and provides no 
grand entryway to the campus but for a lone sidewalk.
Henry Hornbostel was an architectural genius, but it seems 
that the scale and magnitude of his designs were much too 
elaborate for the realities of educational funding to accept. His 
constant revisions created a somewhat disconnected campus, 
and the holes that were left open early in the campuss history 
were to be filled in by later generations with drastically 
different tastes (Wean Hall being the biggest example).
I
 With events such as the Porter rededication, the University 
shows that it not only has the ability to look to the future of 
campus architecture by expanding our west campus, but 
it also can recognize the extraordinary mind of an architect 
who has impacted the everyday experiences of thousands of 
students.
Hornbostel's Administration building (top) would have served as a major gateway to the campus from Frew Street. The 
College of Fine Arts (above) is one of the few designs where the final building ended up larger than the initial concept.
feature Q
pillbox 5.01.06
The design of Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall changed rapidly in a short period of time. The original design (left) would have led visitors to a central women's quad. Hornbostel's later 
proposed additions to the building (above and below right) would have given the hall a grand new entrance from the lawn to its east.

Stick It to the critics
The latest teen movie may be better-suited for TNT
Concerned about your safety? You should be, because 
the entire Pittsburgh SWAT team was out in full force 
last Wednesday to watch some undersized teen queens 
handspring, roundoff, and flip-flap their way to victory. 
Walking into the advanced screening of the new film Stck 
It, I was stopped outside of theater 10 to have my Puma bag 
searched by some man who didnt even ask where I bought 
it!
Making the first cut, I was accosted by an outstretched 
wand ready to caress my inner thighs. Not beeping in any 
strange places, the wand allowed me to keep my course.
All I wanted was to find my seat and bask in the movie, an 
encore performance to writer and director Jessica Bendinger's 
life-changing Bmng It On (if for no other reason than that 
so-damn-catchy DAAAMMMN IT SMELLS IN HURR" tribal 
chant). But I couldnt even do that! At least, I couldn't do it 
before I was intenogated on whether I had smuggled tapes, 
CDs, DVDs, video cameras... into the theater. Yes, I happened 
to bring along my extensive collection of Salt-N-Pepa cassette 
tapes. All I needed was a swinging light bulb and a good 
cop/bad cop routine and the scene would have screamed 
Guantanamo.
I shouldnt be so tough. I mean, they were looking out for 
my safety, right? Just making sure I wasnt carrying an
explosive. If only they had put Touchstone Pictures through 
the same investigation  they seem to be the ones who really 
smuggled in the bomb.
What do reviews of Stck It and house-training my familys 
new puppy have in common? Both involve a waste of 
newspaper. Realizing Stck It's target audience isnt much 
of a stretch of the imagination. The prepubescent girls 
surrounding me at the movie's screening (the same ones 
screeching for a free T-shirt to be thrown their way by some 
disc jockey known only as Jorge) dont care what Roger 
Ebert has to say about their flick  they just wanna know 
when the sequel is coming straight to video!
Heres the story anyway. Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is 
busted for trespassing after playing some makeshift X-games 
on private property. (Aw, man! Cops suck!) The judge (that 
funny elderly woman from Mms. DuLbtSme) sends her off to 
VGA, an elite gymnast training facility, for some Olympicstyle reformation. Oh! Haley used to be a world-champion 
gymnast, before she bucked it all at "Worlds" and tarnished 
her career. The skeleton hanging next to the black shirts in 
her closet explains that one.
VGA is run by Burt Vickerman, played by veteran actor Jeff 
Bridges. Well, "veteran enough for you to wonder, "Wait.
What the hell is Jeff Bm^ges doing in this movie? when hes 
introduced during a sequenced pan of spread-eagle gymnast 
thighs. Other critics have called Bridges the film's saving 
grace  a perfect-10 performance in a pool of mediocrity
 but I was too distracted by his starched popped collar to 
notice. He rides around on an old tractor while the girls train, 
and it is never explained why.
See? I cant really tear this movie to pieces, because I know 
its going to put you and me in the same position someday
 not moving as we pick it up on TNT and cant tear away 
until the credits roll and were left with the all-too-common 
I-just-spent-75-minutes-of-my-life-watching-a-movie-on-TNT 
guilt complex.
The critic is supposed to tell you to go see other, more 
"important" movies than Stck It. Movies that dont play like 
a 90-minute Pussycat Dolls video, or at least dont feature 
computerized sequences of synchronized floor exercises. But 
I cant do that. Not for this paper, not for this movie. Because 
we, my fellow students, are the Kerri Strug generation. Come 
on! You remember!

Despite your love for Scientology and Joey Potter, we still 
kind of love you deep down inside. We've seen M:I-2 more

An A'emcan HaLntng - May 5
Most honor movies just dont work. Theyre not scary  
theyre just mildly disturbing. This one, however, looks like it 
'ght be worth your time. Its based on the only documented 
U.S. case of a ghost causing someones death. This probably 
means its the type of scary thats scarier because it could 
actually happen. That is, if youre afraid of ghosts. We 
certainly dont check our closets before we sleep... that would 
be crazy, right?
The Da Vnc Cu^e - May 19
Depending on who you ask, the book was good. The movie? 
Well, maybe Tom Hanks isnt the best choice for Robert 
Langdon. Our first thought when we see him is, "Life is like
a box of chocolates. So is this movie. Were not quite sure 
what were gonna get. AH we know is Gand  we mean, Ian 
McKellen  makes one awesome Teabing.
X-Men: The Last Stan^ - May 26
Remember Leopold, Catwoman, and that kid from the 
short-lived Disney channel series In a Heamtbeat? Theyre 
back for part three! This time, a cure has been invented 
to make mutants normal. The characters need to figure out 
whether they want to be human or keep their powers. More 
importantly, the big question is finally answered: Will 
Wolverine finally get his yellow spandex suit? Guess you have 
to see it to find out.
SLpem'an RetLmns - June 30
Five Reasons Were a Bit Anxious About This Movie:
1. Wheres Tom Welling?
2. Wheres Tom Welling?
3.-5. WHERES TOM WELLING?
This disturbs us immensely. However, this movie should still 
be interesting. Hes saving the world while trying to fit in, and 
he wants the girl. Wait, this sounds like Sp^em'an 2. We 
hope its half as good.
The Devl Weams Pma^a - June 30 
Not a big-budget action movie? Whaaaat? ChickLit! If you 
need a break from explosions and superheroes, check out this 
one. Weme not paying $10 to see this one  we'll wait for 
McConomy. On the other hand, The Nanny Dames, which is 
also coming out soon, may be a lot better.
Pmates uf the Cambbean: Dea^ Mans Chest - July 7 
Pirates have been getting a lot of exposure at this school. 
Despite what it sounds like, though, ths pirates movie is 
wholesome family fun. Seriously. Between Johnny Depp, 
Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley, this movie has so much 
eye candy that you'd have to be asexual to miss it.
Snakes un a Plane - August 18
Do we really have to convince you to see this? Shouldn't you 
want to with all your heart and soul? Samuel L. Jackson (a.k.a. 
Shaft) signed up for this movie based on the name: Whats 
it about? Snakes. On a plane. If you couldnt figure that one 
out, how are you still at Carnegie Mellon? It's a bit sad that 
it comes out so close to the end of the summer and that we 
have to wait so long for it. On the bright side, this means well 
have something to talk about when we get back.

Sometimes you might think, Hey. Itd be cool to have a tail. And it

pants.

Your attempt to rewrite the first three Star Wars movies will fail miser

your opinion that the second two movies needed more Gungans and 
Ewoks.
With the O threatening to close down, youll have to seek out a new 
source of cheap greasy late-night food. Lucky for you, 24-hour Geagle 
sells Crisco in family sizes.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, making them 
much like every other person. I mean, how often do you say to yourself, 
"Ive got to go and throw some stones? Thats right, you don't.
Excessive metaphors make your prose difficult to follow. Clean, simple
