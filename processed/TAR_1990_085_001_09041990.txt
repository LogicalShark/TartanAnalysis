CMU debt 
reaches $50M
y NICOLE BROCKMANN
TartanNews Editor
When Robert Mehrabian, suc
ceeded Richard Cyert as CMU's 
president, he also inherited a $50 
million debt.
According to Vice President for 
Planning and Business Affairs Pat 
Keating, though, the situation is 
under control.
This is not a new issue, said 
Keating. People are just focusing 
on it now due to the change in 
administration.
Keating says that the debt has 
been incurred gradually over the 
past eight or nine years due to 
rising costs and falling revenue. 
The main causes are general reno
vations and large purchases, in 
addition to approximately $13 
million in costs remaining from 
improvements in Wean Hall and a 
complicated transaction involving 
the sale of computers in the early 
1980s.
According to Keating, the Univeri ity has accrued a total of $170 
million in debt. $87 million is cur
rently available in reserve funds 
for repayment.
Of the remaining $83 million of 
debt, approximately $37 million is 
from projects which Keating calls 
self-financing, meaning that 
these projects will eventually make 
up their own debt. The new resi
dence hall and the new parking
garage are two such self-financing 
projects.
The remaining $46 million, plus 
covering the costs of finishing the 
new sport fields and other smaller 
projects, is the problem which the 
University must now address.
Keating said that Mehrabian has 
promised to develop both a balanced 
operating budget and a balanced 
capital budget for the 1991 fiscal 
year, and to develop a comprehen
sive plan for dealing with the debt 
and with any future interest pay
ments which may accrue from it.
What Ive inherited is a very dif
ficult budgetary constraint. Its my 
policy to have a balanced budget, 
and I dont want to borrow money, 
Mehrabian told The Pittsburgh Press 
August 16.
Keating stressed, however, that 
the University will handle the debt 
over a long time. There is no imme
diate risk or urgency, he said.
He also pointed out that dealing 
with the debt does not necessarily 
mean eliminatingit. Rather, he said, 
dealing with the debt may mean 
maintaining an appropriate level of 
debt.
We may find that having zero 
debt is unadvisable, he said.
Currently, there are no specific 
methods on the table for repaying 
the debt. Keating mentioned the 
possibilities of increasing the en
dowment or setting up special re

Tartan Senior Staffiuriter
In a press conference last Tuesday, Vincent Eirene  
the man who Carnegie Mellon Police Sergeant Ricci once 
called CMUs resident protestor  accused Carnegie 
Mellon of conducting military and defense research.
While Eirene is known principally for his opposition to 
Carnegie Mellons Software Engineering Institute and its 
involvement with Defense Department contracts, his latest 
arrow hit a new target, charging that the School of 
Computer Science is involved in defense-related opera
tions of its own.
Speaking in front of the Clock outside Doherty Hall, 
Eirene cited a report by the Computer Science Depart
ment titled Final Report on Supercomputer Research, 
which details the departments collaboration with the 
Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) on an artificial 
intelligence system for use on the USS Carl Vinson.
The purpose of the system, called Command Action 
Team (CAT), is described in the report as to monitor and 
assess potential threats against a carrier group and to 
recommend possible actions for countering those threats.
At press time, A. Nico Haberman, dean of the School of 
Computer Science, Duane Adams, associate dean for 
research, and Anthony Lapuzza, public affairs officer for 
the NOSC, were out of town and could not be reached for 
comment.
When asked about the project, Carnegie Mellon Provost 
Angel Jordan stated that although he was not familiar 
with the project, he didnt feel it violated the Universitys

Student Senate slashes organization budgets 14%
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Most student organizations 
funded by Student Senate will 
sustain a 14 percent budget cut 
this week because of the failure of 
an April referendum to raise the 
student activities fee.
It was the best solution that 
we could find, said Student Sen
ate Chair Chris Neighbor. Four
teen percent was the amount with 
which all the organizations will 
hopefully still function.
Over the summer, Senate Fund
ing and Recognition Committee 
Chair Sateria Venable decided 
that the 14 percent cut was the 
best solution. I wanted to make 
as small a cut as I possibly could. 
In addition to the across-theboard budget cuts, some groups 
will be denied planned capital 
expenditures. To determine 
which clubs were denied capital 
expenditure funds, I tried to get a 
feel for those areas where debate 
over the expenditure existed and 
where it seemed organizations 
could hold off a year in purchas
ing certain items, said Venable.
As a result, AB Techs sound
system, with a cost of $33,000, 
will only receive $10,000 for main
tenance; WRCT will only get one 
piece of equipment costing $2100 
rather than two; the Student Un
ion, already having computer 
facilities, will have to wait on its 
$3100 Mac II; the Computer Club 
will have to wait on its $2100 
piece of equipment; and the Ex
plorers will have to wait on their
$750 windsurfer.
Neighbor hopes organizations 
will be able to fill in the gaps with 
fundraising. It would increase 
their membership and improve 
the quality of life on campus  
more students would get involved 
in the different clubs and organi
zations, he said.
During the summer my job was 
to come up with a system to cor
rect the budget, said Venable. I ! 
contacted two F&R committee 
members, one other senator, and 
was in close contact with both the 
dean and assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs, Michael Murphy and 
Anne Witchner. All F&R commit
tee members were notified. Be
fore anything was implemented I 
met with and got support from all

Mellon pledges arts center
By D. A, HENDERSON
Tartan Darkroom Manager
The Carnegie Mellon capital 
campaign has surpassed its goal 
through a $5 million gift from 
Paul Mellon, son of Carnegie 
Mellon benefactor Andrew Mel
lon, for a new performing arts 
center. Mellon opened the cam
paign with a $10 million gift in 
1986.
I want this commitment to 
challenge and inspire alumni to 
join in our fund raising efforts for 
the performing arts center, which 
will be a vital addition to the
Oakland campus, Mellon said.
Paul Mellons exciting gift will 
make a center for the performing 
arts on campus a reality, one of 
my most fervent wishes, said for
mer Carnegie Mellon President 
Richard M. Cyert. Im especially 
delighted that this gift put the 
campaign over the top since it 
was his gift to the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
and the College of Fine Arts that 
started off the campaign four 
years ago.
The campaign, a year ahead of 
schedule, has raised $204 million 
dollars, $4 million above its origi
nal goal.
According to David Maloney, 
vice president for development, 
the Board of Trustees is in the 
process of deciding how to best 
utilize the remaining year of the 
campaign.
Already included in the 
campaigns improvement projects 
are the new student center, the 
new Electronic Materials Tech
nology Center, the expansion of 
the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration, and the new 
performing arts center.

United States forces may attack Iraq
Although the administration still 
holds out for a diplomatic solution, New 
York Newsday reported last Friday that 
the Bush administration plans mas
sive military attacks  mostly by air 
against Iraq within four to ten weeks if 
United Nations negotiations are unsuc
cessful and the ecoonomic embargo fails 
to work.
 Newsday quoted senior sources in the 
Bush administration as saying there 
was no debate on whether air strikes 
against Iraq should be used, but only 
atrout the timing.
! The newspapaer said U.S. forces in 
the Persian Gulf would reach a pla
teau in about a month, but world accep
tance of military action against Iraq 
was also a consideration.
Newsday said there would be no effort 
by the U.S. to engage in separate nego
tiations with Iraq, and that diplomatic 
overtures would be handled by the U.N.
Iraq may have 6 million men
^Saddam Hussein claimed last Wed
nesday in an interview with French tele
vision that he has more than six million 
men under arms, six times more than 
Was generally believed.
Today there arent just a million men 
behind me, but five and a half million 
more, the Iraqi leader told the TF1 tele
vision network in Baghdad.
Iraq makes secret offer
Also last Wednesday, Iraq told the 
White House that it would withdraw 
from Kuwait and allow foreigners to
leave if certain demands were met.
Newsday reported that in its secret 
offer, Iraq said it wanted United Nations 
sanctions lifted, guaranteed access to 
the Persian Gulf, and sole control of an 
oil field that dips into Kuwait.
White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk refused to confirm or deny the re
port.
A former high-ranking U.S. official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said he was unsure whether the proposal 
was a serious offer or floating some
thing to see whether youre going to bite 
or not.
However, Newsday quoted an uniden
tified administration official who spe
cializes in Mideast affairs as saying that 
the proposal was serious and that the 
package was negotiable.
That official said it was significant 
that Iraq made no mention in its pro
posal of a precondition that the United 
States pull its troops out of Saudi Ara
bia.
The official said earlier Iraqi proposals 
had contained what he described as 
impossible demands, such as linking a 
pullout from Kuwait with an Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza.
Hussein releases women, children
Iraqs decision last week to release 
foreign women and children was made 
to preserve the image of Arabs, accord
ing to a statement from Iraqs Revolu
tionary Command Council as reported 
by the official Iraqi News agency last 
Tuesday.
Some of the several thousandWestemers in the country have been sent to key 
military and civilian installations to deter 
any attack by U.S. forces stationed in 
Saudi Arabia.
Last Wednesday, Iraq confirmed that 
foreign women and children were free to 
leave the country as of that day. The 
Iraqi News Agency (INA) said that the 
decision applied to all families which 
Iraq decided to host.
But as of later that day, the White 
House said it had no evidence that Iraq 
had allowed women and children to leave 
the country.
At a press briefing, White House 
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that 
the U.S. charge at the embassy in 
Baghdad had been informed that minors 
and women would be allowed to leave, 
but we are still looking into the details 
of what this means, he said.
The State Department did, however, 
praise Iraqs offer, saying the action, if 
implemented, would represent a signifi
cant step toward easing tensions. De
partment spokesman Margaret Tutwiler 
said an Iraqi diplomat in Washington, 
D.C., confirmed that the offer had been 
made and noted that Iraqi officials in 
Baghdad have issued preliminary regu
lations governing the exit of all Western 
women and children.
This announcement, if implemented, 
is a step in the right direction, Tutwiler 
told reporters. We hope Saddam Hussein 
has the decency to live up to his words. 
The preliminary regulations require 
U.S. officials to list the names of all 
women and children wishing to leave  
a requirement that Tutwiler acknowl
edged carries some risks. When asked 
whether giving out the names of women 
and children could endanger them, Tut
wiler said, the Department is aware of 
such a possibility.
On Thursday, Iraq demanded that 
foreign planes wishing to fly to Baghdad 
to airlift stranded Western women and 
children would be allowed to land only if 
they carry food and medicines.
Otherwise, the evacuees will travel in 
convoys overland, most likely to the 
Turkish border, 373 miles north of 
Baghdad, said diplomats in the capital 
who insisted on anonymity.
They said in telephone interviews that 
by noon Wednesday in Baghdad local 
time, no exit visa had been issued for any 
Westerner, pending a response from 
foreign governments to the demand for 
food and medicines.
No one expects any development be
fore Saturday, said one senior diplomat.
According to this diplomat, the evacu
ees may head for Turkey rather than 
Jordan because the journey north was 
more pleasant and almost the same dis
tance.
U.S. troops will stay in Middle East
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Colin Powell said that the U.S. must 
maintain a deterrent force in the Middle 
East no matter how the current crisis is 
resolved. It is essential to remain en
gaged in the Middle East once Hussein is 
defeated, Powell said.
We must maintain a deterrent force, 
he said. This is a world where ready 
armed forces will continue to be essen
tial.
Saddam must release hostages be
fore the U.S. engages in active nego
tiations on a pullout of U.S. forces 
from the Middle East. Powell said 
Hussein will not prevail.
Powell also said that Iraqs August
2 invasion of Kuwait reinforces the 
U.S.s responsibility as the free world 
super power. When someone needs a 
cop to come restore peace guess who 
gets called. We do. We need forces 
that are light and mobile, that are 
easily airlifted.
General Norman Schwarzkopf, com
mander of the U.S. forces in the Per
sian Gulf, said at a televised news 
conference last Friday that the 
buildup of troops in the region was 
ahead of schedule.
He added, however, that there were 
no weaknesses that he could see in 
the deployment to date.
The U.S. now has upwards of60,000 
troops in the region.
Asked about Iraqs stated intention 
to use chemical weapons, Schwarzkopf 
said the U.S. troops have the best 
equipment in the world to protect 
them. He said Iraq will pay big time 
if it uses chemical weapons.
When asked by one reporter if the 
U.S. troops would retailate with nu
clear weapons, he said that wasnt a 
question that could be answered by 
someone in my pay grade, indicating 
that such a decision would rest with 
President Bush and the Pentagon.

Ultrasound scans accurate
' BOSTON (AP)Ultrasound 
-scans can be accurate enough to 
take the place of amniocentesis
- for checking fetuses for spinal 
abnormalities and some other 
severe birth defects, research
ers say.
Amniocentesis, while gener
ally safe, carries a small risk of 
triggering a miscarriage. Ultra
sound poses no known risk to 
the growing fetus.
However, amniocentesis is 
often recommended when rou
tine blood tests given to preg
nant women raise the possibil
ity that their unborn children 
have major birth defects.
The blood test checks for ele
vated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. While many things can
cause this protein to be higher 
than normal, there is a 1 per
cent chance that it means the 
baby has a defect.
To make sure the fetus is 
healthy, doctors frequently 
withdraw a sample of amniotic 
fluid with a needle to see if it, 
too, contains elevated levels of 
alpha-fetoprotein, a sign of 
spina bifida, abdominal wall 
malformations and other seri
ous birth defects.
The new study, published 
Thursday in the New England 
Journal of Medicine, found that 
by using ultrasound to take 
pictures of the fetus, doctors 
can see these defects directly 
and accurately judge whether 
or not the fetus is healthy.
Brokerage firm sues Exchange
PHILADELPHIA (DJ)  Usu
ally its the small investors who 
gripe that securities industry 
arbitration is unfair. But now a 
few financial industry titans claim 
they are getting a raw deal.
In an unusual lawsuit, the New 
York brokerage firms of Paine 
Webber Inc., Bear, Steams & Co. 
and Neuberger & Berman are 
accusing the Philadelphia Stock 
Exchange and its executives of 
cronyism and prejudice in han
dling an arbitration case brought 
against these firms by irate op
tions traders.
The exchange simply chose 
sides in favor of its hometown 
boys, complains James C. Tread
way Jr., a PaineWebber execu
tive vice president and former
member of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
The legal wrangling erupted 
after a charge by the exchanges 
disciplinary committee that Paine 
Webber, Bear Steams and Neu
berger broke exchange rules and 
federal securities laws. Specifi
cally, the committee alleged, the 
firms violated an exchange dead
line for using stock options to 
capitalize on late-breaking news 
that boosted the underlying stock 
of Farmers Group Inc., a Califor
nia insurer. Other companies that 
lost money on the trades have 
lodged claims totaling more than 
$1 million against the three firms.
By counterattacking in court, 
the three brokerage houses shat
tered a hallowed securities-industry code: To avoid expensive liti
gation and bad publicity, member 
firms at financial markets agree 
to arbitrate disputes internally.
If the suit succeeds, It might 
become common to challenge the 
arbitration process, which would 
run counter to the whole intent of 
exchange arbitration, says Ed
ward W. Morris, vice president 
for arbitration at the New York 
Stock Exchange. Brokers warn 
that individual investors might 
ultimately bear the added costs of 
litigation.
In their suit, now pending in 
federal court in Philadelphia, the 
New York firms accused exchange 
officials  including President 
Nicholas Giordano and General 
Counsel William Uchimoto  of
prejudging the three firms guilty 
and then tainting the proceed-j 
ings by conveying their views to 
arbitration committee members.
Thats just not true, Uchimoto; 
says. The exchange has gone out; 
of its way to make sure the proc\ 
ess is fair.
Giordano declined to comment.

CMU, NASA launch new project
ly DANIEL DE GRANDPRE
Tartan Calendar Editor
..Carnegie Mellon researchers 
are working in conjunction with 
NASA to develop a new robot 
which may take more than one 
giant step for mankind.
The Ambler is a six-legged 
autonomous rover prototype being 
developed by the Mars Group, a 
part of the Robotics Institute. 
According to Takeo Kanade, co
director of the Institute, the pur
pose of the Ambler is to autono
mously navigate natural, rugged 
terrain to perform a given task. 
This includes sampling materials 
from other planets.
The 5100-pound, 12-foot tall 
Ambler can step over obstacles 
three feet high, climb 30-degree 
slopes containing meter-wide 
ditches, plan the best route be
tween two points, and correct its 
course to adjust to changing con
ditions.
The Ambler must be almost 
completely autonomous in navi
gation because any communica
tions between Earth and Mars 
take thirty to forty minutes, an 
unacceptable time lapse for real
time decisions.
There is no way you could teleoperate any machine on Mars, 
said Brian Albrecht, a graduate 
student working on the Ambler 
project.
However, the human element 
will not be totally removed from 
the system. In the short term, it 
is realistic for a human scientist 
to decide where the Ambler should 
go, said Kanade.
The robot must, though, have
the capability to safely navigate 
using its own initiative, says 
Kanade.
To accomplish this, said Ka
nade, three design/engineering 
specifications must be fully inte
grated before the Ambler can be 
implemented.
First, the Ambler must have 
extensive mechanical capabilities; 
that is, it must be able to handle 
rugged, tricky terrain. Amblers 
six legs are grouped into two sets 
of three to provide a stable plat
form. The robot moves in what is 
described as a circulating gait 
whose actions are similar to an 
eggbeater, hence its original nick
name, the Legbeater.
The body is propelled in a 
motion similar to cross-country 
skiing, said William Red Whit
taker, director of the Field Robot
ics Institute. A single leg reaches 
out in front of the others, places 
itself firmly on the ground like a 
ski pole and then pulls the ma
chine forward.
The Amblers mechanism was 
designed by civil engineering 
graduate student, John Bares, 
along with six other undergradu
ate students, said Albrecht. The 
robots electronics were also de
signed by a team of Carnegie 
Mellon graduate and undergradu
ate students.
Because the drive motors that 
support the Amblers body are 
separate from those that propel 
it, the robot remains level whether 
it is walking on flat or rugged 
ground. The design provides a 
stable platform for sensors, scien
tific equipment, and sample ac
quisition tools.
Another necessary ability for 
the Ambler is the capacity to see 
its surroundings. A laser rangefinder mounted on the top of the 
unit constructs three-dimensional 
maps of the surrounding topogra
phy and objects it might be inter
ested in sampling, allowing the
where it is and see where its 
going.
The version of the Ambler cur
rently being developed, while 
actual size, is really a prototype 
designed for use on Earth. A real 
Ambler, which would be designed 
for Martian specifications, would
Ambler to pick its path at a rate of be made of materials lighter than
one meter per minute. Without 
the rangefinder, the robot can 
move at speeds of up to five me
ters per minute; however, it would 
be unable to maneuver around or 
over obstacles.
Sensors in the Amblers legs 
allow it to test its footing by ap
plying weight to the ground un
derneath the leg. If the ground 
gives way, the Ambler attempts 
to find another place to walk.
Additional sensors, such as 
cameras, infrared, and sonar, may 
be used in addition to the laser. 
Radar may be particularly useful 
to determine the density of the 
ground in front of the Ambler, in 
case of a hollow area below ground 
that could cause a cave-in.
Finally, the Ambler must be 
able to plan an optimal path and 
make critical decisions, such as 
distinguishing which of two or 
more objects should be retrieved 
and how to retrieve it.
The Amblers unique software 
control system, called Task Con
trol Architecture, enables it to 
plan for the selection of stable 
and safe steps.
The system is designed for 
robots that operate in dynamic 
and uncertain environments, 
explained Mitchell. It uses a 
variety of sensors with different 
ranges and resolutions to know
the aluminum used on the cur
rent model.
Another difference between the 
prototype and a Mars-spec ver
sion is power supply; Ambler is 
currently powered from a wall 
socket. The version of the Ambler 
sent to Mars will probably pow
ered by a nuclear battery, which 
will require more space, but the 
entire system will fit inside a stan
dard payload bay of either a 
shuttle or a Delta rocket.
In the near future, Albrecht 
wants the Ambler to perform a 
mission by having it walk 
around the building on its own. 
Currently, the Ambler is sup
ported by a five-ton crane as a 
precaution, and Amblers support 
team must be more confident that 
Ambler can handle itself without 
tipping over before letting it out 
alone.
Albrecht hopes that the Ambler 
will be able to go outside for a 
demonstration sometime in late 
1991, but the system must first be 
fully weatherproofed and tested 
for stability.
We want to make the Ambler 
an appliance that you can turn on 
and run by itself, said Albrecht.
In the last two and a half years, 
the Field Robotics Center has 
spent $4.5 million on the Ambler 
project, said Albrecht. Funding
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Contributing Editor 
The Ambler robot's six-legged design makes It ideally suited for 
exploring lunar terrain.
renewals are done on a yearly 
basis, and so far, he affirmed, 
NASA has been pleased with the 
work thats been done.
The Ambler is only one of the 
concepts being evaluated under 
NASAs Planetary Rover pro
gram, which is focused on un
manned rover technology with 
both legged and wheeled options 
under development.
For instance, the Ambler must 
compete with another machine 
known as Robby, a six-wheeled 
system which is being developed 
by researchers at the Jet Propul
sion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
California.
In a sense, this is a competi
tion,  said Albrecht, but ideas 
are exchanged and concepts are 
shared freely.

traditional orientation performance.
This year, the Freshman Camp was 
eliminated in favor of weekend trips to 
the zoo or to a baseball game, a move 
which was generally well-received.
The weekend trips were really great, 
said counselor Mike Fugaro. A sopho

Counselor Kick Grimes agreed. There 
seemed to be a lot of participation, he 
said.
Grimes, a junior electrical engineering 
major, was also a counselor at last years 
orientation. He said that this years 
program went more smoothly than last 
years.
It was mostly because they had more 
time to plan it this year, he said. We 
knew what to expect. And not going to 
camp made things a whole lot easier 
administratively. Theres just not really 
anyplace thatyoucan take 1,200 people. 
There was always something to do, 
said incoming freshman Mike Keller. It 
was basically pretty good.
Freshman Teresa Chang disagreed, 
however. I thought it was really good in 
the beginning, but it was too long. By the 
end, everyone was really bored. The small 
groups were good at first, but towards
the end, nobody went to them. Also, they 
mixed CIT and CFA [students] together, 
but they had nothing in common. 
Chang suggested that the ideal length 
of orientation should be no more than 
four or five days, rather than a week.  
Grimes said that for next years pro
gram, counselors should give more at
tention to talking about AIDS and sexu
ally transmitted diseases.
Make sure these things get aired and 
talked about  then hopefully more 
freshmen will be aware of them and they 
wont have the it cant happen to me 
syndrome, he said.
Fugaro said that the weekend trips 
should definitely be kept in the program 
and that more informal small group time 
should be added.
Keller said he would have liked to have 
a good map of the area near campus. 
Also, breakfast should be later, he said.
Music department welcomes bagpipers
By KATHLEEN GUGER
Tartan Staffwriter
; The Carnegie Mellon music 
iepartment has opened up new 
opportunities for students by 
ijncorporating an undergraduate 
tyagpiping degree program into 
i$s curriculum. This is the first 
degree of its kind to be offered by 
any university.
' To major in this new program, a
student must take music theory, 
music history, piano, voice, and 
all other core courses required by 
the university for instrumental 
majors. In addition to this train
ing in the fundamentals of music, 
an aspiring piper must take pri
vate studio instruction in bag
pipes and further, is required to 
participate in classes designed to 
teach the history and mainte
nance of the instrument.
All of the new courses specifi
cally designed for the bagpipers 
will be taught by one man, James 
McIntosh. He is an internation
ally known performer and teacher 
in the art of piping. According to 
Marilyn Taft Thomas, the head of 
the music department, McIntosh 
is considered to be one of the best 
bagpipers in the world.
Thomas went on to say that 
with McIntoshs skills readily

available on campus, it was a 
logical step to simply design a 
degree for him to assist in teach
ing.
McIntosh has done much to 
further the awareness and accep
tance of the bagpipes as a per
formance instrument. He estab
lished a teaching program for 
bagpipes in Scottish public schools 
and released his own music un
der two recording labels.
McIntosh has been on campus 
working with the Kiltie Bagpipe 
Band and has been helping to get 
the new degree program on its 
feet. He has also been assisting in 
the development of an adjudica
tors program for bagpipers in the 
eastern United States.
Accordingto Sharon Johnston, 
director of student services in the 
music department, we have had 
a great deal of interest about the 
program come in. There have been 
a number of inquiries from this 
country and from around the 
world  Canada, Australia, and 
Scotland. We are not certain well 
have students this semester, but 
we expect some next semester and 
certainly, by next fall.
Sig Tau wins award

tional Man of the Year run
ner-up award. The Man of the 
Year award is the highest 
which can be bestowed upon an 
undergraduate member of 
Sigma Tau Gamma.
To qualify for such an honor, 
Sitar maintained an Honor Roll 
QPA and boasts a long list of 
activities including being a 
resident assistant, membership 
in the American Society for 
Metals, membership in the 
Student Advisory Council, and 
numerous fraternity offices.
It was quite an honor, said 
Sitar.
Another important aspect of 
the fraternity is their pledge 
program.
PresidentRay Atkins stressed 
that the SigTau National likes 
to show other Sig Tau houses 
around the nation our pledge 
program.
Aron . Temkin, another 
brother, added that we create 
opportunities during the pledge 
program for the brothers and 
the pledges to do things together 
with the specific intention of
teaching the benefits of the 
group.
The principles of the frater
nity are what we really stress, 
said Sitar.
Atkins commented on the 
newsletter as another focal 
point for the fraternity's suc
cess.
We put out a total of three a 
year and they describe what we 
have been doing with rush, 
pledging, homecoming, Spring 
Carnival and all of our plans 
and ambitions. We also have a 
place for alumni to write in.
As for their scholarship 
awards, Vice-President of Edu
cation Russell Boyd said, We 
have educational programs for 
the brothers. We help people 
with scholarship. We have 
people in charge of scholarship 
so if they need help with a 
subject or if they just need 
motivation, they can be direct 
to somebody whos had a cour 
We also have programs abo 
alcohol awareness, career ori
ented educational policies and 
things of that nature ... so its 
not just a pledge program.

in the early development stages, 
will be built mainly for the use of 
the College of Fine Arts, but the 
hope is that expanded program
ming in music, drama, and the 
Visual arts will provide opportu
nities for all students to broaden 
their cultural experiences.
We want at every level pos
sible to overcome the feelings that 
CFA is isolated from the rest of 
the University, said CFA Dean 
Lowry Burgess. One of our big 
Remands for [the performing arts 
center] is that it requires interac
tion, and interferes, in a way, 
with life in a very positive way on 
campus, so that every student 
who has dwelled here for four 
years or eight years or whatever 
cant say they havent encoun
tered art in all its forms.
Burgess hopes that in addition 
to the 600-seat theater which is 
already planned, the new center 
will also include some student 
galleries, a cabaret theater, and 
other small theater and film fa
cilities.
'First of all, we think of the 
notion of building a performing 
arts complex or center... as a way 
of empowering the whole output 
othe College of Fine Arts, to 
make It better, more aggressive, 
more capable all the way around, 
S'aid Burgess.
According to Burgess, the crea
tion of the new center is part of a 
recent effort to create an appre
ciation of the aesthetic of the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
Proposed sites for the new cen
ter include the plot of land be
tween Warner Hall and Doherty 
Hall and the plot between Marga
ret Morrison Hall and Donner 
Hall; however, according to 
Maloney, no site has been chosen 
yet.
'As to speculation on the com
pletion date of the new center, 
Burgess would only say that Presi
dent Mehrabian is very eager to 
see the ground start moving next 
summer.

research policies.
We dont do military research, said 
Jordan. Asizable portion ofthe research 
we do is funded by the Department of 
Defense, but all of it is unclassified.... 
There are no significant strings attached 
to it.
According to the report, the research 
was sponsored by the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency ofthe Depart
ment of Defense, and was monitored 
under contract by the Space and Naval 
Warfare Systems Command. The au
thors note that one ofthe chief problems 
they had in conducting the research was 
that much of the actual domain knowl
edge was classified... we had to build the 
system using false data whose similarity 
to the real data we could only guess.
According to Jordan, all research proj
ects themselves are not classified, though 
he confirmed that there are many people 
at Carnegie Mellon, including himself, 
who have access to classified informa
tion. He says the University does not 
conduct what he calls mission-oriented 
research, not because it is improper, but 
because we dont have the facilities.
Eirene also claimed that the CAT sys
tem on board the USS Carl Vinson is 
being employed in the Persian Gulf. 
According to Lieutenant Mark Walker,
an action officer with the Navy News 
Desk at the Pentagon, however, the ship 
is currently in safe harbor off the coast of 
California.
But according to military sources, that 
still doesnt negate the possibility that 
the system will be used to aid ships 
involved in military maneuvers in the 
Gulf. Although the report only cites the 
systems application in the Carl Vinson, 
sources at the Naval Air Force Pacific 
Fleet (AIRPAC) in California say that 
such a system would most likely be used 
throughout the carrier fleet, rather than 
simply on board the Carl Vinson.
It would be a little unusual for it to be 
used just on that ship, said Senior Chief 
Bob Howard. Were real sticklers for 
continuity.
According to the report, the CAT sys
tem identifies possible threats through 
an artificial intelligence system which
uses a method of progressive categoriza
tion. The first, and most general level of 
identification is accomplished via con* 
cept nodes, which identify potential 
threats according to broadly-defined 
categories, such as aircraft, ship, of 
submarine. .
From the concept nodes, the item being 
monitored is then identified according to 
more specific object nodes. The reportcites, as an example, that the concept 
node aircraft connects with object nodes 
bomber, fighter1, helicopter1, reconnais
sance, and tanker.  ,m
The process may then be further re
fined by predicate nodes, which can 
more completely describe an objects 
length, size, type, speed, course, or 
maximum range.
According to the report, once a poten* 
tial threat is identified, the system will 
recommend a possible course of action.

will be named after him and will contain nearly 75,000 square feet of 
classrooms, laboratories, and equipment.
I am pleased and honored to be able to assist in this worthy project 
so that Carnegie Mellon, a major university and one that I love and 
admire, can provide a state-of-the-art facility where students and 
faculty will work together in this important area of materials re
search, Roberts said.
The building will house research focusing on future technological 
needs, including the growth and processing of high performance 
semiconductors, the tailoring of magnetic properties for very high 
energy product applications, and investigation of the structure and 
properties of semiconductors and of magnetic and superconducting 
materials.

; serves, but no courses of action 
 have yet been chosen.
In the past, the university was 
able to increase its income through 
; a process called arbitrage.
! Under this system, the univerI sity could issue bonds at tax-ex
empt rates, resell them at a later 
date, and invest the profits at tax
able rates.
Its a perfectly legal process,
. said Keating. Its a strategy used 
; by most private universities.
Under the 1986 tax laws, how
ever, the University can no longer 
utilize arbitrage as a way of gar
nering income.
There will also be some large 
; projects which will tax the 
universitys monetary resources 
in the near future. These new 
projects include the University 
Center, the newbuildingfor GSIA, 
the Electronic Materials Technol
ogy Center, the Performing Arts 
Center, and renovations of the 
undergraduate chemistry labora; tories.
These are our five key projects 
for right nowthey are the focus 
of our fundraising, said Keating.
There are also annual capital 
needs such as routine mainte
nance and small-scale renovations 
to be considered. But Keating 
thinks that, due to costs, less of 
these operations will go on in the 
near future.
We will have to be more con
strained in this type of thing, he 
said.

Senate slashes spring budgets 14 percent
continued from page 1
of them.
According to Witchner, student 
organizations subject to the cuts 
were notified over the summer.
I think it [the 14 percent cut] 
was fair, F&R Committee Mem
ber Scott Zucker said. Sateria 
did a really effective job. Shes 
been thorough and careful. It 
seems that everyone in F&R 
agrees with what shes done. 
The budget cuts represent 
Senates latest attempt at 
straightening out a fiscal night
mare which dates back to last 
January. The original error oc
curred last spring due to a lot of 
miscommunication about the 
amount of money we thought we 
had available and the amount we 
actually had, said Neighbor. 
Probably the major reason this 
happened in the first place is that 
some things had changed in 
Warner Hall with their account
ing system.
Only full time students (stu
dents who take 19 or more units 
each semester) are charged for 
the student activities fee, but the 
administration included all stu
dents when they estimated how 
much money the Senate would 
receive, according to Neighbor.
Last year we had a surplus 
which we used up, with no reali
zation by either the Funding and 
Recognition committee [F&R] or 
the Student Senate, he said. As 
a result, the contingency fund does 
not exist this year.
The referendum would have 
increased the activities fee an 
amount that would have allowed 
the [organizations] budgets to 
stay at the amounts they received 
for the 89-90 year. Because it 
was not passed, we had to cut 
down to 588-89 standards and 
actually, some budgets are below 
that level; newer and successful 
organizations formed since then 
such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters
Had the referendum passed, none of 
this would have happened and no 
cuts would have had to be made.... 
Students will hopefully vote more in
telligently should a referendum arise 
in the future. 
 Scott Zucker, 
IM Student Senator
and the Womens Center require 
funds, said Neighbor.
Had the referendum passed, 
none of this would have happened 
and no cuts would have had to be 
made, said Zucker. There was 
the implication that the Greeks 
would get the full benefit of the 
activities fee increase. But, thats 
not the case and as a result all the
organizations are suffering. 
Understanding this, students will 
hopefully vote more intelligently 
should a referendum arise in the 
future.
Senators are hopeful that the 
student body will pass the fee 
hike under different circum
stances. According to Neighbor, 
Senate will probably attempt to
raise the fee again this semester, 
in time for the springs bill. The 
proposed raise must pass a stu
dent referendum in order for it to 
be presented to the Board of I 
Trustees.
To prevent further budgeting 
problems within the different 
organizations, a financial train
ing seminar is being planned for 
later this month.
We feel that financial officers 
and the presidents of organiza
tions dont know enough about 
financial management, said 
Neighbor.
The training seminar will cover 
topics such as reimbursement 
requests and reading accounting 
sheets. Student organizations will 
work closely with Anne Witchner 
to learn about budget manage
ment.
There will be a special budget 
meeting on Thursday at 7 pm in 
the Skibo Ballroom to discuss 
these budgets.

New prices leave students hungry
Were bothered by this years 
increase in both meal plan and 
menu prices without a correspond
ing increase in contract meal al
lowances.
Over the past few years, there 
has been a pattern that cash prices 
in the Tartan Grill, the Morewood 
Gardens cafeteria, and other a la 
carte facilities have grown faster 
than meal allowances, reducing 
th amount of food that students 
on a meal contract can buy with 
one meal.
This year the pattern has gone 
too far. Even after an average 
meal plan price hike of 9.5 per
cent, students cannot get as much 
food per meal as they could before.
Most people would say that a 
cheeseburger, large fries, a large 
soft drink, and a piece of fruit 
constitute a reasonable lunch. The 
price of this meal at the Tartan 
Grill is $4.10, more than the $3.95 
lunchtime meal allowance.
Carnegie Mellon Dining Service 
Director James Gurley told The 
Tartan that the changes have 
stemmed partly from the sub
stantial mortgage payments 
which CMDS owes for the new 
Highlander Cafe. He also pointed 
out that the cash allowances are 
usually larger than the student 
cost per meal of most meal contracts.
All of this really misses the point. 
Students and their parents buy 
meal contracts expecting that they 
will receive a reasonable amount 
offood. Its unacceptable that they 
dont.
Gurley noted that the Tartan 
Grill offers a contract allowance 
special during each meal period 
which provides a specific combi
nation of food discounted to the 
amount of the meal allowance. 
But Dining Service admits that 
historically, these specials have 
not been heavily used. It seems 
that any one combination only 
appeals to a fraction of students.
Gurley correctly believes that 
specials have potential to provide 
complete meals on meal allow
ances. He promised The Tartan 
that specials will be created at 
Morewood Gardens and that he 
will look into increasing the 
number of specials offered.
We endorse this plan as a way of 
allowing students to remain 
within their meal allowances 
while still eating full meals.
If it works, Gurley deserves 
credit for quickly responding to a 
pressing problem. However, if the 
specials offer too little food or prove 
unpopular, he will need to try 
again.
The new dorms are not quite done
Carnegie Mellon deserves a 
round of applause. The new resi
dence halls are everything they 
said the administration would be 
 and perhaps a bit more.
The new stadium has already 
shown that it will become a valu
able part of campus life, and the 
very location of the new buildings 
has opened up a part of the cam
pus that was previously under
utilized. Thebuildings themselves 
are beautiful, well-built, and ob
viously the result of a great deal of 
time and effort.
But like any nearly-completed 
project, there are a few kinks 
which need to be worked out of the 
system before all the construction 
workers pack their bags and head 
for other projects:
Inadequate water pressure. In 
the morning, water pressure in 
some rooms in the new dorm is 
often too low to take a real shower. 
Although this problem may elimi
nate itself as students start skip
ping morning classes to sleep in, 
the plumbing in the new building

needs to be able to support its 
population throughout the entire 
school year.
Inadequate ventilation. The 
new residence hall was obviously 
designed from the start to be air 
conditioned, yet Housing decided 
that the air conditioners and, 
worse yet, the fans intended to 
move air throughout the other
wise unventilated building should 
be turned off. It is understand
able that air conditioning is ex
pensive to run, but how about 
turning on the ventilation fans?
 Inappropriate furnishings. The 
shelves in the new dorm are too 
low to hold many textbooks, there 
is only one mirror per suite, and 
the closets have no doors. Hope
fully, Housing still has enough 
money in its budget to fix these 
minor irritations now.
Poor acoustics. The circular 
portion of Highlander Cafes seat
ing area is a certified nightmare. 
How about some acoustic tile 
designed to blend in with the new,' 
impressive decor?
Editor:
Welcome back to 
Carnegie Mellon. Ive 
been taking a crash 
course for the past two 
months, tryingto learn 
as much as I could about this great uni
versity.
One thingthathasbecome abundantly 
clear since I started as President on July 
1: Carnegie Mellon is blessed with hard
working, dedicated students,faculty and 
staff. It?s included among the nations 
best institutions because of the un
equaled level of commitment you find on 
this campus.
It is my goal this fall to visit all of the 
colleges and departments, to tour educa
tional and research facilities, to get a 
better understanding of the University 
and its components.
This learning process is helping me get 
the facts I need to make decisions, estab
lish priorities, and set long-term direc
tions.
Of course, I began this process with my 
own vision for the immediate future of 
the University. And Id like to share with 
you a few of the specific areas Ive tar
geted as priorities for the coming year:
Enhancing Quality of Life: One of 
my priorities is improving the quality of 
life on this campus. When I discuss the 
quality of life, Im not simply referring to 
those activities we do for fun. Im sug
gesting broadening the educational ex
perience for students.
We want programs and activities that 
help us explore our cultural diversity, 
programs and activities that stimulate 
students to interact across college and 
departmental boundaries.
Among Americas colleges and univer
sities, Carnegie Mellon represents arare 
combination of business, science, tech
nology, and the fine and liberal arts.
Will you as a student in chemical engi
neering, for example, graduate from 
Carnegie Mellon having experienced the 
arts at your university? Will you have
developed a greater understanding of 
and appreciation for the work of your 
classmates and professors in artistic 
fields?
Will you as a student in design, for 
example, graduate from Carnegie Mel
lon with a knowledge of science and tech
nology? In an increasingly technological 
world this knowledge will be important 
to all of us, whatever our field.
Encouraging this interaction, provid
ing these opportunities at a university is 
as basic as bread and butter.
Improving Facilities: Im commit
ted to building the University Center  
a key quality of life componentas soon 
as possible. A great deal of fundraising 
work has already been done and were 
optimistic that well be able to raise the 
money we need to get this building 
started. Architects are at work on final 
designs for this structure. Well keep you 
updated on this project through The 
Tartan and through open campus meet
ings.
Well also build a Performing Arts 
Center. A generous gift of $5 million 
from Paul Mellon has been earmarked 
for this center. Another major gift of an 
equal amount would put us in position to 
move ahead on this project. A Perform
ing Arts Center will be symbolic of the 
Universitys rich heritage in the arts.
We hope to break ground sometime 
next year for the new addition to the 
Graduate School of Industrial Admini
stration. A $6 million gift from alumnus 
George Roberts has moved us very close 
to startup on an Electronic Materials 
Technology Building.
Fundraising for these buildings, as well 
as improvements in undergraduate labo
ratories and other facilities, is our first 
priority.
The beautiful East Campus project  
the residence halls, football stadium, 
intramural fields, and parking garage 
sets ahigh standard for future construc
tion. I hope youll all join us on Septem
ber 15 when we dedicate the stadium
during the football game with the Uni
versity of Chicago.
Improving Undergraduate Educa
tion: This university needs someone who 
wakes up each morning thinking solely 
about the quality of undergraduate 
education.
I see this person as part of a new 
Provosts Office. We announced this 
summer that Dr. Angel G. Jordan, our 
Provost since 1982, has decided to return 
to teaching and research after eight years 
of distinguished service. We began a 
national search for Dr. Jordans succes
sor. The new Provost will be the 
Universitys chief academic officer.
Expanding Educational Opportu
nities Abroad: We must prepare you 
for leadership in the next century, lead
ership in what will be a global environ
ment for business, science, technology, 
humanities, social sciences, and the arts. 
Therefore, weve begun work toward 
initiating a major Education Abroad 
program. This includes enhancement of 
our existing exchange agreements and 
new opportunities for those students who 
are interested in spending one or more 
semesters abroad.
These are just some of the important 
areas Ive identified. Like you, Im here 
to learn this fall. Im counting on student 
leaders and others to help us focus our 
energies and resources on programs and 
activities vital to student interests.
You and your work build the enduring 
reputation of this university. My ad
ministration is committed to enhancing 
the educational experience at Carnegie 
Mellon so that youlike valued alumni 
before you  will leave this institution 
prepared to make important contribu
tions to the world.
I wish all of you a successful, enjoyable 
and productive academic year, and I look 
forward to meeting many of you on 
campus.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor: O^ii
Welcome, first-year 
students and welcome 
back returning stu
dents! I believe we have 
a wonderful year ahead 
of us, and I want to raise a few important 
issues as we begin the fall semester.
Above all, I want to ensure that we do 
everything we can in the Division of 
Student Affairs to make this a great year 
for you. Throughout the year, I would 
like to hear from you as to the ways in 
which we can continue to develop the 
services and support that you need and 
want. Working together, we will main
tain the vitality of our exceptional uni
versity community.
I want to suggest to you a few ways in 
which I think you can make the most of 
the year:
First, you should take the time to enjoy 
the rich blend of individuals on this 
campus. To take full advantage of the 
Carnegie Mellon community is to engage 
all of its members. This is an opportunity 
to deal with men and women of varied 
ethnic origin, religious belief, sexual 
orientation, national origin, vocational 
interest, and various other characteris
tics in an intense way which will not 
likely be replicated in your life. Take 
advantage of this piece of the university
experience.
Second, I urge you to get involved in 
student organizations. We have over 100 
organizations on this campus, and more 
being established every year. We have a 
strong intramural program, a vital Greek 
system, club sports, academic clubs, and 
a variety of other groups to provide sup
port, an opportunity for learning, or just 
plain fun. This is important for first-year 
students, but equally so for upperclass 
and graduate students who would like to 
increase their campus involvement.
Third, know that if you run into diffi
culty, you have somewhere to turn. We 
want this to be a comfortable and sup
portive environment for each of you. If 
you face an academic or personal con
cern, take advantage of our academic 
and non-academic support services. Let 
us help when youre in need, and always 
feel free to let us know how we can help 
others.
Fourth, the diverse university commu
nity carries with it a shared culture of 
openness and acceptance. As in the larger 
community, however, incidents may 
occur which deprive an individual stu
dent of taking full advantage of the 
community. If you feel at any time that 
another member of this community has 
created a hostile environment for you or 
has harassed you in any way, I want you
to speak to me personally. Our discus
sion will be held in confidence and we 
will work together to remedy the situ
ation.
Fifth, study hard and have fun. You 
have many goals in your life, and I know 
that you will at times feel that the com
peting demands for your time and en
ergy are overwhelming. Always keep your 
extraordinary talent in mind, and give 
everything you can to make you and our 
community grow.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Three years 
ago, I wrote a 
letter to the edi
tor at The Tar
tan concerning 
plans for the University Center, 
then in their infancy. Below, I 
quote a portion of that letter:
My conversations with people 
who have been involved in plan
ning for the University Center, 
and my viewing of the model and 
drawings of the plan which was 
selected as winner of the design 
competition both point toward an 
apparent decision which I regret. 
It looks to me as though, at best, 
'the indoor track which has been 
contemplated will be crammed 
into a building too small to ac
commodate anything but a jog
ging track with relatively square 
comers and many laps to the mile. 
My understanding is that what 
has been contemplated would be 
cantilevered from the outside 
walls of the building, high above 
some interior space, with an open 
hole in the area inside the track. 
I have been assured several times 
Ithat no final decisions have been 
made, but the member of the 
committee working directly with 
the architectural firm who chaired 
a subcommittee on athletic and 
recreational needs has told me 
that he considers an eight lap to 
the mile track on the same level 
as interior space to be infeasible 
and unjustified by our needs at 
CMU.... My own impression, ad
mittedly quite biased by my own
interest in running, is that there 
are a great many people in the 
CMU community who consider a 
well-designed, high-quality in
door track to be a high priority in 
the design of a new athletic facil
ity....
After that letter appeared, two 
petitions (neither of which I had 
any part in writing or circulat
ing) were circulated by Cameigie 
Mellon students. One went as fol
lows:
The design for the new Univer
sity Center should include an 
indoor 1/8 mile track. Currently, 
there are no similar facilities to 
train on during the winter 
months. In addition to being used 
by varsity athletes, the track 
would also be of great use to the 
campus community as a whole. 
The current plans to build a much 
smaller jogging track seem to be 
more of an inconvenience than a 
benefit. The smaller track would 
be overcrowded and the shorter 
laps and sharper turns would 
provide a greater chance for run
ning injuries. The design of such 
a facility would be a waste of the 
Universitys money. I ask you to 
reconsider your design plans for 
the University Center so that it 
includes an indoor 1/8 mile track. 
1187 people in the CMU commu
nity signed that version.
The second petition (in the form 
of multiple copies of a letter to 
persons involved in the planning) 
read:
As a concerned member of the 
CMU community, I hereby give
my support to any motion, idea or 
design that would include a oneeighth mile indoor track as part of 
the new University Center ath
letic facilities. Such a facility 
would be useful to the University 
as a whole, since it would be 
available to faculty, staff and 
students alike for the purpose of 
recreation and fitness. At the 
present time, there is no facility 
on campus that can be used for 
winter running (or walking), so 
there should be one in the plans to 
improve this campus. I would also 
like to withdraw my support from 
the proposition of building a jog
ging track that, with its short 
distance and tight turns, would 
be useless for anyone even re
motely serious about fitness. This 
type of track presents a constant 
risk of injury to those using it. 
Also, these tracks become very 
impractical when there are more 
than a few people using them at 
one time. I believe the population 
of this university deserves the 
best it can get from the new Uni
versity Center. A one-eighth mile 
indoor track would fulfill the 
needs of the University admira
bly. A small jogging track, as it 
has been proposed, would simply 
be a waste of money. 499 addi
tional CMU people signed that 
version.
The signers included a dean, 
department head, faculty mem
bers, graduate students, under
graduate students and staff 
members  a broad and diverse 
cross-section, and a significant
percentage of the entire CMU 
community. In addition, 14 people 
wrote individual letters to me, 
expressing their agreement with 
and support for my position. I 
received one letter expressing 
disagreement, saying that we 
have more pressing needs to at
tend to.
During the past three years, I 
have attended planningmeetings, 
met with senior administrators of 
the University, and served on the 
Schematic Design Committee 
for the University Center, in each 
case trying to convey the need for 
a high-quality indoor track to 
serve a broad spectrum of people 
with a broad range of abilities 
and interests in running and 
walking, and the senselessness of 
including a joggers track in the 
design.
Recognizing the many interests 
which the building must serve 
and the severe budgetary con
straints, I have expressed my 
personal opinion that, while a 1/8 
mile track would be most desir
able, a 1/10 or even a 1/12 mile 
track, if very well designed, would 
be worth including, but that a 
sharp-turned narrow joggers 
track would be a waste of money, 
destined for very limited use.
Despite repeated assurances to 
me from Vice President for Uni
versity Planning Pat Keating that 
other faculty members and I who 
have expressed interest in the 
track issue would be consulted 
and informed prior to any final 
decision, last year the indoor track
was eliminated from the Univer
sity Center program. Subse
quently, Senior Vice President Ed 
Schatz was appointed chair of the 
Schematic Design Committee. To 
his credit, but after the die was 
cast, he asked the committee to 
consider whether a 1/10 or 1/12 
mile track might be reinstated in 
the program.
The verdict is now in, and I feel 
obliged to report it to the Univer
sity community. I quote from a 
memo from Dr. Schatz, dated July 
30,1990:
The additional cost of a 1/12 
mile track proved to be too high. A 
lot of that cost involved bowing 
out of the gym cavity to accom
modate the track. So the 1/12 mile 
track is out, but we have asked 
the architects to design the gym 
cavity in such a way that a joggers 
track could be installed at a later 
date. Such a track would be ram
ped, but its rectangular profile 
would make it largely unsuitable 
for serious runners.
Dr. Schatz also told me on 
August 14 that there are a num
ber of people who disagree with 
my assessment as to the worth of 
a joggers track, but that he could 
not tell me who they are. He prom
ised to arrange a meeting in which 
I can talk with them.
I cant help but feel extremely 
frustrated by the decision-making process that I have observed 
here. I believe that the architects 
and senior University adminis
trators have been opposed to 
anything but a joggers track
from the start, and that they have 
had little interest in seriously 
considering the tradeoffs between 
a high-quality track and a 
joggers track. I believe I have 
been viewed as an irritant to them, 
a track zealot who should be tol
erated, but not be taken with se
rious consideration.
Their argument now seems to 
be that, with all the building has 
to do (at the last count to which I 
was privy, about 42,000 square 
feet of student activity space, 
21,000 square feet of dining serv
ices space, 11,000 square feet of 
retail function space, and 46,000 
square feet of recreation and fit
ness space), that the addition of a 
track just isnt feasible.
My reply is that a track has 
been part of the discussion from 
the very beginning; it is now an 
addition only because it was ig
nored and/or belittled through
out the planning process.
If we are stuck with plans for a 
building which will not accommo
date a high-quality track, its 
because that is what the archi
tects and administrators chose to 
design. It is my fervent hope that 
the decision-making processes in 
the new administration will be 
much more open, based upon 
broad consensus, and less subject 
to the interests, biases, and whims 
of a few people in positions of 
power.

At first I thought it would be hard to 
adjust to a life away from home. My main 
problem was how much I missed every
thing back home in Garden City, New 
York. Many of my friends are a year 
behind me, and as a result are still in 
high school. This made it very hard to 
leave my little world on Long Island, 
since I knew that most of my friends 
would be going into their easiest school 
year while I was beginning my toughest 
away from them. My attitude over the 
first few days was that I was entirely 
ready to return home and repeat my 
senior year of high school over and over 
into eternity because it was easy and I 
knew the people in my classes.

This idea ended during Orientation. It 
took much less effort to meet people than
I had anticipated, even girls  I was 
dreading the fabled 70-30 ratio. I think 
Orientation actually helped the social 
process. Going to the meetings was a bit 
of a downer, but I did meet two people in 
my group and strike up friendships.
It was only after orientation had ended 
that I began to acquaint myself with the
other guys on my floor. At first, I felt a 
little unwelcome, but after a few days, I 
found that the ostracism.I had been 
feeling was not really there. In fact, I 
just needed to get to know the guys a 
little better. Soon, I was meeting people 
that they had already met, and was mak
ing even more new friends. I began to re
alize that I was getting over my home
sickness.
Whether or not homesickness is some
thing that will continue remains to be 
seen. Today is Friday, and so Im getting 
ready to go out and party the way I did 
last week, during Orientation Nights. I 
feel much better now, and I feel much 
more confident about my ability to meet
people. I realize that I dont actually 
have anything to be nervous or scared 
aboutthe worst that can happen to me 
is to be completely ignored by the pretti
est girl at this party, or the DJ at that 
party.
Who cares?
Ive made friends here. Im ready to 
accept that people here are basically the 
same as they were at home. Why should 
I go on being depressed about having lost 
some of my best friends, when, in reality, 
I havent lost anything? Instead of losing 
friends, I have been given a chance to 
make new ones, and I intend to make the 
best of it.
Soon, with any luck, I will feel as
comfortable here as I did in my last year 
of high school. Even though I knew my 
friends at home for years, and Ive only 
known the people here for just a few 
weeks, Im sure I will be just as broken 
up about leaving them to go back home 
once the year ends and the summer ar
rives. I have learned a few things in the 
past week. Some of them were about the 
rigors of this school, but most were about 
the people of this school. Now I can truly 
believe that people are the same no 
matter where they are from.

Diversity can lead to misunderstanding if not properly initiated
Recently, issues about equality 
land race relations again made 
|national news. The incident con
cerned the casting of a white ac;tor in a role that was supposed to 
;be Eurasian, a person of Euro
pean and Asian ancestry.
Miss Saigon, an award winning 
! British theatrical show, was sup
posed to make an appearance on 
Broadway, but along the way, 
; several actors and American 
; Actors Equity, the actors union, 
; condemned the casting of Jon
athan Pryce, a white British ac;tor, in the role of the Eurasian 
! Engineer.
! The issue here isnt one of legal
ity. That is, did Actors Equity
 have the jurisdiction to rule that 
; Pryce be barred from playing the 
role of the Engineer because it 
;was contrary to their equal op; portunity policies? The issue isnt 
really one of color-blindness ei
ther. The issue at hand in the
controversy surrounding the Miss 
Saigon production is really one of 
race relations and how thye should 
be conducted. This controversy is 
a symptom of the problems of how 
race relations are conceptualized 
and practiced in the country 
today.
Diversity is a word used often 
by many people concerned with 
the continued prevalence of race 
discrimination in American soci
ety. Diversity to these particular 
people means that society ought 
to have many different ethnic 
groups living amongst each other 
and that their existence should 
be promoted rigorously as a means 
to foster equality.
In the need to redress minority 
grievances in society, many mi
nority/ethnic groups have begun 
to organize themselves in order to 
participate actively and power
fully in todays political arena, so 
that minority issues will be adLui Sieh
dressed  mainly the continuing 
problem of race discrimination. 
This has had a powerful influence 
on how race relations are con
ducted. As ethnic groups become 
more vocal and outspoken about 
their concerns, the fabric of Ameri
can society is becoming more 
strained. That is because each 
ethnic group is merely concerned 
with its own members and its 
interests. Often, these interests 
clash with interests of other eth
nic groups.
The state of race relations in 
America is one which I would char
acterize as confrontational. It is 
not merely minority vs. white 
which has an inherent value
judgement that whites are some
how superior to other minorities 
both culturally and politically, but 
also minority vs. minority such as 
African-Americans vs. AsianAmericans or African-Americans 
vs. Hispanic-Americans.
The problem which arises from 
this increased consciousness of 
ones own ethnicity is that the 
African-American, Asian-American, or the ethnic-American has 
slowly begun to lose the Ameri
can. People in general are begin
ning to perceive race relations as 
a system in which different eth
nic groups strive for and compete 
against each other for equal at
tention and status. That is, no 
group is better than another, and 
all groups are equally important.
However, while stressing ones 
ethnicity, such as Asian Power or 
African Power, the American in 
everyone gets buried and cast 
aside. American society is being
conceptualized as not composed 
of Americans but of people of dif
ferent ethnic groups competing 
against each other. While it is 
true that America is a nation in 
which many ethnic groups live to
gether, it is still a nation of Ameri
cans. Somehow, the idea of being 
American has been equated with 
white and because of this, people 
feel that they must therefore over 
stress their ethnicity to show they 
arent white and to show soli
darity with their own kind. This 
belief is erroneous.
In any event, this notion is 
dangerous for amiable race rela
tions. As illustrated by the Miss 
Saigon controversy, the empha
sis was on the type of person the 
role required, a Eurasian. The 
focus was on the color of the role. 
Hence, the cry was that the actor 
playing that role should conform 
with the color required of that 
role. This then, is a tendency to

here a few days, I realized that

Now, I know that may be an 
unfair thing to say, but everyone

Little things: dryers that took 
three turns to get things ade

to Scobell and see if theyre bettei); Physical Plant needing 
months to fix the Yards blenders 
(although that little problem has 
been taken care of); all the little 
things that pump a dangerously 
high stress level a few points

I was so impressed when, on re
turning to campus, I found every
where the signs of University 
money spent on us. The school 
looked nice. There were flowers, 
new stairs, landscaping, a defi
nite lack of manure on the cut, 
and, of course, the new dorms.
Ah, the new dorms: what neat 
buildings. The look good, theyre 
built well, and (after a year in The 
Hotel Scobell) a great place to 
live.
Almost.
Ya see, this is the official state

would make, and that I am seri
ous about making. When we ar

over-emphasize the differences 
between people. There is an in
herent contradiction that does not 
work. It makes a mockery of a 
cherished notion that individuals 
from the most important fabric of 
society both socially and politi
cally, and that people should be 
evaluated individually and not 
through any associations with a 
larger group. To do so would be 
stereotyping.
The groups interests have 
superceded the individuals inter
est. By promoting differences, one 
cannot hope to create an atmos
phere that is conducive to ami
able race relations and the accep
tance of others. Yet, this is the 
effect that advocacy of diversity 
has. It is a noble intention gone 
astray.

IM. 
Allan Bourdlus
3 It is time for a new generation 
; of leadership to cope with new 
. problems and new opportunities.
 For there is a new world to be 
won, a world of peace and good
will, a world of hope and abun. dance, and I want America to lead 
the way to that new world.
, Those were the words of Sena
tor John F. Kennedy during his 
presidential campaign of 1960. 
Even though those words are over 
thirty years old, they are more 
true today than they were then.
Today we live in a more dy
namic and a potentially more 
dangerous world than ever be
fore. The next decade will be a 
time of great turmoil and widesweeping change that could con
tinue well into the 21st century. 
We must find a new direction for 
ourselves and for the world to 
guide us through the danger that 
can truly belong to everybody.
The danger we face as we move 
into the 21st centurv is twofold. 
First, the disintegration of the 
bipolar political world (East vs. 
West, Democracy vs. Commu
nism, call it what you will) has 
left a shaky framework behind.
The true multipolar political 
world we have today is poten
tially explosive. In the 45 years 
since the end of the Second World 
War, the strong arms of both the 
Soviet Union and the United 
States pretty much kept the world 
in check. Whenever there was 
upheaval, we usually brought it 
on ourselves. Todays multipolar 
system lends itself to the Third 
World strongman, as the present 
Persian Gulf crisis proves. The 
loss of the bipolar system means 
there is no longer any such thing 
as a Soviet or American client in 
the world. In a sense, the Soviets 
and ourselves have created a mon
ster; a monster we must subdue.
What makes the present situ
ation particularly volatile is the 
proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. Im not in favor of 
eliminating our nuclear or chemi
cal weapons, nor do I think the 
Soviets should, but such a capa
bility in the hands of a man like 
Saddam Hussein is unacceptable. 
We must remember that Iraq is 
not the only Third World nation 
with those capabilities.
I believe the second great dan
ger is that we are gettingtoo much, 
too fast in the way of change. This 
is particularly true in Eastern 
Europe. I am truly excited about 
the potential for increased free
dom in that region, but I have 
little faith in its longevity. The
people of Eastern Europe want 
their nations to Westernize, and 
they want it to happen now. 
Realistically, that just is not pos
sible. Too much damage has been 
done by years of self-destructive 
communist doctrine.
If you look at the region from a 
historical standpoint, there are 
virtually no democratic traditions 
east of the soon-to-be defunct 
inter-German Border. These 
people have been ruled by one 
autocratic form of government 
after another for thousands of 
years. That is not a history that 
can be overwhelmed overnight.
If changes do not occur as fast 
as the citizens of Eastern Europe 
want (and that seems to be the 
case) the potential for and likeli
hood of civil war is very great. I 
even see a potential risk of civil 
war in the Soviet Union. The 
Soviets are heading towards dis
union faster than the United 
Stateswasinthel850s. Soon, the 
Russian Federated Socialist 
Republic will find that it has 
become a tiny and naked island in 
a potential sea of revolutionaries.
How should we move forward 
through these times of widesweeping change? We must move 
carefully, slowly, and most im
portant, firmly pn the path to
wards the time when the world as 
a whole is one community. Our 
past experiences have shown us
that we cannot give freedom and 
democracy as a gift. Every time 
we have tried to, we have failed. 
Freedom must be earned. Free
dom must sometime be won with 
terrible costs. Our job should be 
to direct the world towards this 
new tomorrow that we all want so 
badly.
If we can dedicate ourselves as 
a nation to this, we will bring out 
the best in ourselves and in 
humanity as a whole. In our quest 
we must be firm and steadfast in 
our track. If necessary, we must 
apply our strength to stabilize 
and direct the world.
Kennedy also summed up how 
to direct ourselves towards such a 
goal: Above all, words alone are 
not enough. The United States is 
a peaceful nation. And where our 
strength and determination are 
clear, our words need merely to 
convey conviction, not belliger
ence. If we are strong, our strength 
will speak for itself. If we are 
weak, words will be of no help.
This is J.F.Ks legacy. He never 
spoke those words; an assassins 
bullet saw to that. Let the word 
go forth! Join with me, and to
gether we can head for the new 
and better tomorrow. What will 
come is up to us.

Hello, and welcome back to yet 
another exciting school year. 
Rather than tell you how I actuEilly spent my summer, I will tell 
3rou how it might have turned out, 
had things been a little flifferent.
I could have been in jail.
Yes, that's right, I almost com
mitted a crime. Noble, but evil.
In July, I read in one of the 
Pittsburgh papers that Dr. 
Mehrabians wife has six horses.

Susan Abrams
And I thought it was something 
special to have two dogs. Silly 
me.
I also read that the Mehrabians 
wanted to move into a mansion, 
and I figured they were going to 
use our money to do that. I guess
they didnt realize what poor 
underlings we really are until they 
peeked at our financial statuses.
But they decided not to move 
into a mansion after all. I figure it 
was due to bad publicity, and who 
in their right mind would want to 
set a bad example of oneself to a 
group before he or she even meets 
that group? Whew, they are one 
lucky family. If I found out they 
were using my money, I would

PRESS PASS
by Dan Erhard
Wingen takes CMU basketball helm
IM Assistant Director Mastroianni assumes secondary post
! As I am sure you are all 
'aware, the Pittsburgh Steelers 
began their 1989 season with a 
51-0 drubbing at the hands of 
the loathsome Cleveland 
Browns, followed by a 41-10 loss 
to another AFC Central foe, the 
Cincinnati Bengals.
! Throughout these weekend 
'debacles, the only memories 
quarterback Bubby Brister 
evoked were those of Cliff 
Stoudt, Scott Campbell, and 
Mark Malone. The fans were de! kpondent. The entire Steel City 
Was calling for the Emperor (or 
were they calling him the 
-Antique?) Chuck Nolls resigna
tion.
; However, while the press and 
public cried for changes, the 
players endured, and the 
!coaches kept the faith. With a 
week three rout of the Minne
sota Vikings, the Steelers 
appeared to be turning the 
tables on not only the competi
tion, but also the fans.
^They ended the season with a 
respectable record of nine wins 
versus seven losses, culminated 
by a playoff victory.P "-After such a long drought of 
playoff seasons, a new era was 
on the horizon. With a talented 
backfield, former Rookie of the 
Year and All-Pro wide receiver 
Louis Lipps, dependable tight,end Mike Mularkey, sure
handed Derek Hill, and the 
addition of the shotgun forma
tion in 89, and the Steelers 
would surely contend for the 
AFC championship once again.
; Bengal coach Sam Wyche led 
the praises of opposing coaches 
calling for Noll, who had supervised this young talent so well, 
'to be named Coach of the Year. 
Even Jerry Glanville, who 
'coached the Houston Oilers in 
their playoff loss, sang the 
praises of the Bubster, saying 
he was destined to be one of the 
leagues stars. So what could go 
Wrong in 1990?
! Enter Joe Walton, ex-head 
coach of the New York Jets, as 
the new offensive coordinator. 
To be quite honest with you, 
Walton didnt get that exin 
front of his name for nothing.
; My first reaction was rather 
Simple. Huh? Thats like draft
ing an overweight, underfast, 
unproven tight end in the first 
round. Why hire Joe Walton? 
He couldnt win in the weak 
AFC East division with his oftfrnaligned offensive system, 
headed by million-dollar quar
terback Kenny OBrien, that 
had been rumored to be harder 
ito learn than Greek.
Said the Emperor, I didnt 
expect it to be this hard [for the 
players]. Well, Mr. Noll, it is. 
Witness the 20-9 loss against 
the Dallas Cowboys in the third 
pre-season game. Bubby was so 
stymied by his own plays, he 
only threw for eighty yards 
against the powerhouse Cow
boys, the same team that 
rumbled to a 115 record last 
season.
I I cant write the Steelers off 
; for this year. Noll appeared to 
he incapable of handling the 
team last year and they were 
playoff contenders. However, 
now, rather than the team 
building momentum on last 
seasons success, theyre build
ing frustration on this years 
ineptitude.
Noll decided to shake things 
up this year, and by doing so, 
played around with what 
seemed to be a winning combi
nation, and is now total confu
sion. Well, you know what they 
say, if you shake it more than 
once, youre playing with it.

Former University of the South 
head coach Tony Wingen has been 
named to replace Larry Anderson 
as basketball coach. Anderson re
signed after the 1989-90 season, 
starting a two-month search proc
ess that went through almost 100 
candidates before selecting Win
gen.
Wingen comes to Carnegie 
Mellon with two seasons of Divi
sion III coaching experience at 
the University of the South in 
Sewanee, Tennessee. He compiled 
a 21-28 record in his two years, 
including last years 11-14 mark. 
He was a South assistant from 
1986-88.
Wingen got an early start in 
coaching, becoming the assistant 
coach of the womens team during 
his junior and senior years at 
Springfield (Mass.) College, 
1980-82. He then moved on to the 
position of mens assistant coach 
from 1982-85. Next season, he 
was the mens assistant at Brown 
University before moving on to

the University of the South.
Tonys got a great basketball 
background, said CMU Athletic 
Director John Harvey. Through
out his career, Tonys been re
cruiting and working with the 
same kind of student-athlete we 
have here. I also talked to coaches 
who coached against him, and the 
reports were Strongly favorable. 
Wingen was attracted to the 
Carnegie Mellon opening almost
immediately. The UAA was a 
definite attraction; I think its the 
best conference in the nation at 
the Division III level, he said. 
Also, Carnegie Mellon is a worlqlclass university. Its more visible 
and better-known than the Uni
versity of the South, so I felt this 
was a step up professionally. Also 
its a chance to move closer to 
home; my wifes family lives in 
Baltimore and my family lives in 
Connecticut, so were certainly a 
little closer to them.
In addition to its location, 
Wingen is also impressedby Pitts
burgh itself. Its a great city, he 
said. Id never spent much time 
in Pittsburgh before taking the 
job, and I see somethingnew every 
day and theres just so much to do 
here. My wife Kris likes the city, 
and theres going to be a lot of 
opportunities for my kids as they 
get older.
The transition between coaches 
went smoothly, according to 
Harvey. Most of the recruiting 
had already been taken care of, so 
there wasnt any problem. It would 
have been nice to have him on
...we need to get the campus ex
cited about basketball. If we get the 
team attitude, and the excitement 
and support of the campus, then I 
think we can win some games."
CMU basketball coach Tony Wingen
board earlier, but the timing just 
didnt work.
Wingen agrees that the move 
wasnt as difficult as it might 
seem. From my standpoint, re
gardless of what teamy ou have or 
what school youre at, the prepa
ration is the same. You have to 
get your recruiting off the ground; 
you have to plan your offense and 
defense and plan the way youre 
going to play.
Its going to be different for the 
players, though. My system is very 
different from what theyve been 
doing before. Were going to be 
very aggressive; were going to 
run the fast break and press on
defense; were going to be very ag
gressive on both ends of the floor. 
It will be fun for the players to 
play that type of game and it will 
be fun for our fans to watch as 
well. Its a very exciting style of 
play.
Wingen has not yet had much 
opportunity to work with the 
team, but is excited about what 
hes seen so far. He held his first 
organizational meetinglastTuesday and 30 players showed up. 
Wingen is particularly pleased 
that he has a real good mix of 
upperclassmen andfreshmen; 12

Former CMU soccer star Eddie Park 
selected in second round of MISL draft
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
When Eddie Park, CMLFs leading 
soccer scorer in 1989 graduated this 
spring, the Tartans knew they were 
losing a top-notch player. This sum
mer, they found out how good a player 
he really was. Park was drafted by the 
Baltimore Blast in the second round of 
the Major Indoor Soccer League draft. 
Park joins former Tartan Charlie Lockhead as the second CMU player to be 
offered a shot at the pros, and is the 
first to be drafted by a MISL team.
Park got his chance at the pros in late 
July, when the MISL held its senior allstar game, the USF&G College Indoor 
Soccer Showcase. Playing for the West 
all-stars, Park scored a pair of goals in 
his teams 5-4 victory.
Parks success was made even 
sweeter by the fact that he was one of 
only two Division III players invited to 
the game. Chris Scaglione,Washington 
Universitys goal keeper, was the other 
Division III participant but was not
I was very surprised. I just wanted to do 
the best I could. I wasn't expecting to get

 Eddie Park
drafted by a MISL team.
I was very surprised, said Park. I 
just wanted to do the best I could. I 
wasnt expecting to get drafted. 
Others were not so surprised. I 
wasnt that surprised, saidjunior Alan 
Horn. Hes a lot better indoor player. 
Hes got great ball control, good moves, 
and a good shot.
Its definitely his game, added 
Tartan coach Nick Gaudioso. Hes got 
quick feet, good ball control skills, and 
hes a tough player. Hes made for the 
indoor game.
To get to the College Indoor Soccer 
Showcase, graduating seniors were 
sent through one of six regional com
mittees for evaluation. Park made it
through the regional selection process 
despite a lack of experience with indoor 
soccer. I hadnt played indoor a whole 
lot, he said, only in the off-season. The 
outdoor game is slower, while the in
door game relies on technical ability.
Park isnt out of the woods yet; he has 
yet to pass the Blasts two-week tryout, 
which starts September 24. Should he 
make the cut, his first professional game 
would be October 20. Park isnt too con
cerned about his future in professional 
soccer; hes happy enough with the 
success hes attained so far.
Im going to see what they have to 
offer, he said. I didnt expect to be 
drafted', so Im just going to do the best 
I can and see what comes from it.

Football team anticipates exciting return to campus
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Tartan football team, un
der the guidance of fifth-year head 
coach Rich Lackner, has returned 
to campus after a two year ab
sence! Returned to a new stadium, 
a million-dollar field, and fine 
training facilities, the team will 
begin the new decade in a new 
conference and in a community 
excited about Tartan football.
This will be a season for the 
record books. The Tartans were 
the 15th winningest team in Divi
sion III in the eighties, posting a 
69-22-3 record in the past ten 
seasons. This season, they have a 
chance to notch their 16th con
secutive winning season and break 
the Division III record for most 
consecutive games without being 
shut out.
But 1990 will also be a season 
of question marks. The Tartans 
have left the familiar faces of the 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
behind, and have joined the Uni
versity Athletic Association. 
While the team finished first in 
the UAA last season, a perfect 3-0 
in conference play, there is no 
guarantee that they will repeat as 
conference champs.
I think the competition in the 
UAA is excellent, said Lackner. 
Any thoughts that its not as 
strong a conference as maybe the 
old PAC was, I think are wrong.
The Tartans schedule shows
* r ' -- ;Eras*...-. . ..........
Practicing in the newly-completed 
to an exciting year.
some familiar names, including 
UAA rivals Washington Univer
sity, Chicago University and Case 
Western Reserve. But there are 
several names as unfamiliar to 
the Tartans as they are to the 
fans. Names like Adrian, Woos
ter, Coast Guard Academy and 
Geneva.
It is tough, said Lackner. You 
do have a little bit of doubt as to 
whether the quality of the other 
teams is good or bad because you 
havent played them in the past.
One team the Tartans will miss 
playing is PAC rival Washington 
& Jefferson. Most of the players
Ignatius Sasmita/Photo Staff Manager 
Gesling Stadium on the CMU campus, the Tartans are looking forward
regret having to drop W&J from 
the schedule and lose the intense 
rivalry. Last season, the Tartans 
beat W&J, 17-7.
I liked the PAC because of the 
rivalry with W&J, said senior 
halfback Scott Bamyak.
Offensive Outlook: Last season, 
the Tartan offense set a school 
record for most points in a season 
(300) and was ranked twentythird overall in Division III (40.2 
points per game). With veterans 
filling all of the skill positions, the 
big question mark right now is 
the offensive line. If the line can 
dominate as it has in the past,
look for the Tartans to improve on 
last seasons ranking.
Quarterback: Senior Billy 
Snyder, a UAA honor team selec
tion last year, is back to lead the 
offense this season. Last season 
Snyder completed 55 of 92 passes 
for 860 yards and eleven touch
downs to lead the team in passing 
yards before injuring his knee dur
ing the W&J game. But Snyder is 
better known for his running 
game. He was fifth on the team in 
rushing last year with 202 yards 
and has been classified as pri
marily a roll-out quarterback.
I dont think when Im in the
game that there isnt a play in the 
offense that I cant run, said 
Snyder.
Junior Steve Patemo is known 
for his strong arm and accuracy. 
Last season he completed 41 of78 
passes (52.6 percent) for 601 yards 
and 4 touchdowns.
There are things in the offense 
that are specifically designed for 
Bill Snyder and there are things 
in the offense that are specifically 
designed for Steve Paterno, 
Lackner said.
With two highly capable quar
terbacks, and a third veteran in 
junior Sam Mangano, the Tar
tans should have no problem 
racking up yards through the air. 
Running Back-. With a slew of 
talented halfbacks and fullbacks, 
the running game should be in 
top form again this season. Last 
season the Tartan rushing game 
was ranked 15th in Division III 
football, averaging 252 yards per 
game.
Look for senior All-American 
Scott Bamyak to turn more than 
a few heads this season. Barnyak 
is currently the fourth-leading 
rusher in Tartan history with 
1,530, but he needs just 336 yards 
to take over the lead.
There may be a little bit of 
pressure on me to have a good 
season, Bamyak said. But Im 
looking forward to just getting 
out there, and I know the other 
backs are looking forward to it

CMU soccer looks to new 
players for success in '90
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Anyone who believes solely in 
numbers would feel that the CMU 
soccer team has an impossible 
task ahead of it. After an 8-71 
season, the team lost its best goal 
scorer, its defensive captain, and 
its starting goal keeper.
Its a very young team; 10 fresh
men are listed on the roster, while 
only one senior will be playing 
this season. However, head coach 
Nick Gaudioso feels his team could 
surprise a lot of people.
Were a much more technical 
team than last year, said Gaudi
oso. Everyone on the field can 
keep up with the technical side, 
and thats the biggest and best 
advantage in this sport.
Were more intense and more 
together, added sophomore 
sweeper John Stivoric.. 
Everyones been playing well, 
playing good team ball.
Working as a team is a domi
nant theme of this years Tartan 
team. One of the major problems 
with last years team was that too 
many players tended to be one
dimensional, sticking to either 
offense or defense.
Everyone plays both halves of 
the game well this year, ex
plained Gaudioso. The UAAisso 
tough that you have to have that 
good mix to be competitive.
A good soccer team starts with 
its goal keeper, and Gaudioso has 
given the nod to freshman Dave 
Shapiro as his starter. Shapiro 
made the New Jersey state team 
in his senior year of high school. A 
trio of freshmen, Dan Warren, 
Brian Sanders, and Kurt Luitwieler, will serve in backup ca
pacity.
The defense looks to be the most 
solid facet of this years Tartan 
squad, as all four positions may 
go to returning lettermen. Junior 
Doug Jotzke, and sophomores J.R. 
Yakubisin and Stivoric anchor the 
unit, and junior Mike Yonas re
turns after missing the 1989 
campaign due to injury.
The offense has a few question 
marks, but should be solid this 
season. Juniors Alan Horn, Young 
Kang, and Rob Schaeffer and 
senior Chris Kasabach are proven 
starters, but the remaining spots
are still up in the air. Sophomore 
transfer student Terence Sibiya 
and freshman Min Chong, a high 
school All-American, are also in 
the running for starting roles.
The Tartans will be helped this 
year by the opening of Gesling 
Stadium. Not only are the Tar
tans pleased with the luxury of 
playing home games on campus, 
but most are impressed with the 
quality of the surface.
Even though its easier to play 
on natural grass, its a good field, 
said Gaudioso Its got a low 
crown,, the drainage is really good, 
and the turf isnt as abrasive as 
we thought it might be.
I like it, added Schaeffer. You 
never get a bad hop.
Its not bad for turf, com
mented Stivoric,  but Id rather 
play on grass.
In a final analysis, Gaudioso 
knows exactly what the Tartans 
must do to be successful.
If we can stay healthy, well be 
good, he said. I dont know how 
good until I see the other teams. 
We can play, thats not the prob
lem. The UAA is such a tough 
defensive conference that one goal

iii almost always the difference. 
Were not going to get blown out; 
we just have to play good defense 
and keep the lead once we get it. 
The Tartans open their season 
against Hiram tomorrow at 7 pm. 
The game was originally sched
uled for today, but problems with 
the stadium forced the delay. 
Hiram won their conference last 
year with a 12-3-2 overall rec
ord.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
cross country team extended its 
NCAA record to 105 unbeaten 
dual meet wins Saturday against 
intra-city rival Robert Morris 
College.
Junior Jonathan Frieder 
steamed over Flagstaff Hill in 80- 
degree heat to claim first place in 
26:45. Senior Dan Holland took 
second in 27:14, while freshman 
Dave White followed close behind 
in 27:16. Gary Harrison, also a

in sixth place, making the Tar

freshmen, and there is only one 
senior.
W e will be very young this year, 
which, from my standpoint, is very 
exciting. Coming into a new 
school, a new situation, anew city 
with young players that are eager 
to learn and to adapt to my sys
tem. Thats exciting, and I think 
thats exciting for them, too.
Serving as Wingens assistant 
will be Mike Mastroianni, who
will still retain his duties as as
sistant director of intramural 
athletics and director of club 
sports. According to Wingen, the 
choice of Mastroianni was made 
right away.
Even during the interview 
process, Mike and I hit it off, and 
Dr. Harvey suggested that he 
would make a good assistant. Im 
very fortunate to have a guy like 
Mike because hes got a good 
coaching background in high
school, and hes been on campus 
for four years.
Mikes a good guy, said Har
vey. Through his work in the 
intramural program, I can tell 
that the students like him. Hes 
popular and works well with 
people, and thats the most im
portant thing. It was also a chance 
to have our first full-time assis
tant in recent times.
When asked about, the upcom
ing season, Wingen doesnt have
any predictions as far as wins or 
losses go because if you say youll 
win a certain number of games, 
you tend to back yourself into a 
comer. Wingens major goal for 
the seasonis to improve the teams 
attitude. The biggest thing we 
have to do is create a competitive 
attitude, a winning attitude, and 
also an attitude of team unity. Id 
also incorporate aggression in 
there, too.
I also think we need to get the
campus excited about basketball, 
added Wingen. If we get the team 
attitude, and the excitement and 
support of the campus, then I 
think we can win some games. 
Its not fair to rate any coach in 
his first year on the basis of wins 
and losses, added Harvey. What 
well look at is the satisfaction of 
Tony and the players that theyve 
made progress and developed 
their basketball skills.
In addition to his duties as
coach, Wingen has his share of 
classes and administrative work 
as well. Wingen is currently teach-; '* 
ing a racquetball class and will 
teach a basketball skills course 
next semester. He is also respont, 
sible for scheduling CMUs out
door facilities. mi
In his free time, Wingen enjoysplaying golf and basketball, but 
admits that spending time with 
his family is his primary off-hours 
activity.

Junior Laura Sibley placed 
third in 17:50, followed by team
mate freshman Megan Greig in 
18:16. Sue Sparks, the only other 
nior on the team, completed the 
jerfect 15 point score in 18:58. 
i Only one Robert Morris runner 
broke up the team by placing sixth,
T
while Junior Emily Burke and 
Junior Lois Raska anchored a 
sweet victory, placing seventh and 
eighth, respectively.
Coach Dario Donatelli was 
especially pleased with his teams 
performance. They always make 
me proud, he said. Our greatest 
challenge, however, is in two 
weeks at the Allegheny College
Invitational.
The team is laden with young 
talent. Most of the top runners 
are juniors and will provide 
needed strength and experience 
throughout the rest of the season.
I believe very much in my team 
and I know they will run smart 
races in the future, he said. That 
is what counts most to me.
ATTENTION H&SS SENIORS, and OTHERSDOING H&SS DOUBLE MAJORS OR 
MINORS:
Imagine that someone offered you $13,000 and a 
year to study something that has interested you for 
a long time, that excites you a lot, and that would 
require travel abroad in one or more cultures different 
from your own. Would that interest you, and what 
would you do?
A WatSOil Fellowship can make this possible for you.

Football returns to campus
continued from page 13
too. You always want to run the 
football.
Other halfbacks to watch are 
juniors Drew Pizzurro and Greg 
Marino. The Tartans may also 
look to Pizzurro for kickoff re
turns.
Senior fullback Fran Bellante 
will join Barnyak in the start
ing backfield. Bellante, an 
Academic All-American and 
Honorable Mention All-PAC 
last season, was the secondleading rusher with 411 yards 
and five touchdowns.
 Tight End: The only return
ing tight end is junior Josh 
Hvizdos, who took over last 
season for injured Marty 
Stovar. Hvizdos caught five 
passes for 69 yards and three 
touchdowns and now, in a start
ing roll, will be a likely target 
for both Snyder and Patemo. 
Backing up Hvizdos will be 
junior Greg White.
 Offensive Line: All four start
ers graduated last May, and 
Lackner and offensive coordi
nator Rich Erdelyi had the 
crucial task of filling some 
pretty big shoes.
Im going to put a challenge 
to those guys (on the offensive 
line), Lackner said.
I have no worries, said 
Snyder. The guys that are in 
there right now want to play 
and they have it in their hearts 
and thats the only thing I ask 
out of my line.
Possibly the biggest disap
pointment for the line this 
season has been the departure 
of junior Bill Barry, a potential 
starter at offensive guard. 
Behind Redman and Wilson, 
the rest of the teams guards 
are freshmen.
 Wide Receiver: With the loss of 
Mike Beresford, last seasons 
leading receiver, the Tartans will 
look to seniors Wayne Carson and 
Don DeCaro to pick up the slack. 
Between the two, the Tartans will 
have a lot of speed at the position.
People think that we might 
not be as strong at receiver with 
Breeze gone, Snyder said. But I 
have a great rapport with Wayne 
and Don. I know what those guys 
are going to do because Ive worked 
out with them a lot and we have a 
very open relationship.
Kicking: The placekicking game 
is solid again this year, with for
mer soccer player Joe Schwerha 
taking care of extra point conver
sions, field goals and kickoffs.
Wayne Carson averaged 32.8 
last season on punts and had a 
long punt of 50 yards. He will 
undoubtedly get the call again 
this year, but dont look for him to 
be the only punter.
Defensive Outlook: The team re
turns six starters from last years 
20th ranked defense, 14th against 
the rush and 19th in scoring de
fense. Ten of the eleven starters 
this fall are seniors.
I think the defense looks really 
good and I think we have a lot of 
talent, said senior linebacker Bob 
OToole.
 Defensive Line: The Tartans usu
ally go with a five man front and 
three down linemen. Seniors 
Carlos Rodriguez, Jim Rose and 
Marvin Germany will anchor the 
line this year.
Were not real big guys, Ger
many said. But were quick and 
we can cause problems for the 
offensive line.
Linebacker: Senior inside line
backer Bob OToole, a two-time 
Academic All-American and UAA 
honor team pick, was second on
the team in tackles last season 
with 67, including 39 solos. 
OToole, a pre-season AllAmerican, has three varsity let
ters to his name.
Outside linebacker Chris Balouris, also a senior and three
time letterman, was sixth on 
the team in tackles last season 
with 39.
Returning to football after a 
pre-season foot injury kept him 
out all of last season, senior 
Mike Hession will try to make 
up for lost time, backing up 
OToole at inside linebacker. 
Defensive Secondary: Seniors 
Mark Imhoff and Jack 
OSavage are the returning 
starters at strong safety and 
strong corner respectively. 
They are joined by returning 
lettermen John Riesmeyer, 
Brian Lippert, Bryn Marelli, 
Jeff Palaima, Drew Helms, and 
John Fratto.
Imhoff, a College Football 
Preview pre-season National 
Scholar Athlete, had 29 tackles 
last season and led the team in 
caused fumbles with two.
Position by position, the Tar
tans have one of the strongest 
teams around. But team unity 
is more important than indi
vidual performances.
The team is going to have to 
worry about the team and not 
about individuals, Lackner 
said.
Everybody on the football 
team is going to contribute this 
year and they have to under
stand their role and work hard 
to be the best role-player that 
they can be, whether that role 
is as a starter or not. And thats 
the key to winning, this year or 
any year.

Volume 85, Issue 1The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University. Pittsburgh. PennsylvaniaSeptember 1990Oakland's Carnegie cleans up its act
Ignatius Sasmita/1 artan nnoto stan Manager 
The Carnegie receives its first cleansing. The difference is clearly seen as the workers slowly circle the building.
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Some people feel that it should have 
been left alone.
I dont mind them trying to clean up 
tradition; my only concern is that they 
will change it in the process, said Drew 
Maxwell, an MCS junior.
After standing for nearly a century in 
the soot-blackened air of Pittsburgh and 
accumulating a layer of dirt one-eighth 
of an inch thick, The Carnegie is clean.
Although some, like Maxwell, dont 
welcome the bath, others are happy with 
it. Im quite glad they did it, said John 
Fiala, another MCS junior. It looks nicer 
and you can see things on the walls that 
you couldnt see before. Although the 
cleaning process is almost complete, a 
concession to the dissenters has been 
made  a small panel of the music hall 
wall facing the parking lot has been left 
dirty.
The Carnegie, a long-standing monu
ment to human knowledge located be
tween CMU and Pitt, will be completely 
clean within the next few weeks. The 
buildings sandstone surface, once char
coal grey, has been returned to its origi
nal color and the inscribed names of fa
mous thinkers once buried beneath the 
layer of filth can now be read again.
But the cleaning process hasnt been 
short work. Begun in the summer of 
1989,the building in its restored form re
calls the grandeur of Old Pittsburgh, but 
aesthetic value is only one reason which 
made the cleaning necessary.
According to R. Jay Gangewere, editor 
of the Carnegie Magazine, head of the 
restoration project, and an English pro
fessor at CMU, The Carnegies porous 
sandstone makes it unusually vulner
able to the elements which cause dete
rioration. The dirt encrusted on the 
surface of the building held water close 
to the stone for years and caused signifi
cant structural damage.
The cleaning of the Carnegie also aided 
the workers in locating other problems 
which had previously been concealed 
beneath the layer of dirt, including bro
ken and chipped stones.
The cleaning process itself involves 
many steps. The chemical prewash is 
brushed on and left to break down the 
dirt for several hours. It is then rinsed off 
with water under pressure. Next comes 
a low-pressure application of afterwash 
which is also allowed to sit before it is 
removed. Much care is taken to avoid 
putting too much pressure on the 
buildings surface; excessive force on the 
stone can be detrimental.
When the cleaning has been finished, 
the next steps in the restoration of the 
building can begin. First, the irrepara
bly damaged stone will be replaced by 
new sandstone mined from the original 
quarry. Then the discolored mortar will 
be repaired and the building will be 
protected by a chemical sealant. Finally, 
new lighting and landscaping will be 
added, thus completing the restoration 
of the building.
The cost of the entire renovation pack
age has been estimated at $150 million.

 Charles Mennell, last year's 
project manager
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
Late last May, four students 
climbed into a U-Haul truck with 
a 130 pound car that largely re
sembled a buggy. At that time, 
the four didnt know that their 
first attempt at victory in a com
petition would be thwarted by 
something as simple as a blown 
tire.
The students, members of Car
negie Mellons Society of Automo
tive Engineers (SAE), were 
headed to Ontario, Canada, to 
compete in the Shell Fuelathon. 
The fuelathon is an annual event 
that brings together academic in
stitutions from around the world.
How does 900 miles per gallon 
sound?
CMU-1, the aptly named car, 
passed all ofthe safety tests an 
incline test, brake test, and a mini
mum turning radius test  but 
during the actual competition a 
tire blew, forcing the team to for
feit.
The team returned to campus
to prepare for the next competi
tion, which was to be held in a 
couple of weeks. During the in
terim period, Charles Mennell, 
last years project manager, 
deemed the fuel injection system 
undependable and a carburetor 
was put in as a replacement. The 
car has a carbon composite, a 
fiberglass and steelbody that rests 
on an aluminum undercarriage. 
Without the driver, the car weighs 
130 pounds.
Again the team piled into the 
U-Haul and set off for northern 
territory. This time, it was the 
Eaton Corporation Proving 
Grounds in Marshall, Michigan. 
For the second time the car made 
it through all of the safety tests. 
This competitipn, however, saw a 
better finish: fifth place out ofthe 
25 competing teams.
A big part of the competition is 
just getting there, says Phil Heil, 
this years project manager. In
deed, 11 of the original 25 teams 
in the Michigan race did not com
pete at all, for various reasons.
The actual race consists of
having the vehicle run six laps 
around a 1.6 mile track using iso
octane as fuel.
To insure that each team starts
with the same amount of fuel, 
Shell Oil gives each team a fuel 
cannister with the fuel in it. The 
cannister is weighed before and 
after the race to determine how 
much fuel was consumed. By 
knowing the weight of the fuel 
consumed, one can compute how 
many miles per gallon the vehicle 
gets.
Carnegie Mellon came in fifth 
place with 360.31 miles per gal
lon. In first place was the Univer
sity De Sherbrooke with 951.85 
mpg. In second place, the Univer
sity of British Columbia obtained 
820.24 mpg. Third and fourth 
places were captured by Ryerson 
Polytechnical Institutes two cars. 
Their first car, Olympus got 
756.96 mpg and their second car, 
Pegasus got 655.77 mpg. Carne
gie Mellon had the best fuel con
sumption rate of all the American 
teams.
As far as buggy technology help
ing SAE get an edge in competi
tion, Mennell said, [Buggy tech
nology] has the potential, but no 
one is willing to give away the 
information. [Buggy] also draws 
away a lot of talent. Its sucking 
our people away.
We used some of the [buggy 
technology]. Some helped, some 
hurt. The wheels killed us. John 
Wiss, professor of mechanical en
gineering and faculty advisor for 
SAE, added.
In addition to the fuelathon car, 
SAE also has a Baja car that it 
hopes to start competing with. 
The Baja cars frame was built in 
1988 and is now being welded to
gether. The engine is a stock 8 
horsepower Briggs and Stratton 
engine. The Baja car must travel 
on land and water. SAE managed 
to build their car so that they use 
the traction of the back tires to 
propel it across the water.
For the next fuelathon competi
tion, to be held in the spring, Heil 
hopes that the team will do much 
better. We have the fuel injec
tion system and the microproces
sor all ready. All we have to do is 
put it in, he said.
According to Heil, an engine is 
much more fuel efficient with a 
fuel injector as opposed to a car
buretor.
Wiss also has sethis hopes high. 
I dont think its unreasonable to 
think of 1000 mpg. Thats not our 
goal, thats our fallback level."
The Society of Automotive En
gineers will hold its first meeting 
Thursday at 4:30 in the third floor 
lounge ofScaife Hall.

: -Well, school has started once
| again. Unfortunately, because of 
the shock which the beginning of 
the-school year brings on me, Ive 
had a bit of a mental block, and 
have been unable to write a col, umn.
Luckily, Ive been able to per
suade my grandfather, Jerimiah 
Grizzelby Smith, to donate an 
article for this weeks column. 
Grandpa Jerimiah is famous in 
our family for the wonderful sto
ries, or yarns as he used to call 
them (before I was bom, he was 
the family wit). How well I re
member sitting around the din
ner table at Christmas, when he 
would lie down and tell us a story 
from his youth. Soon we would all 
be lying down. This goes to ex
plain why people would always be 
refusing invitations to our family 
dinner (actually, I think I minded 
the snoring the most). Without 
further ado, I give you one of my
JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
grandfathers favorite stories: 
First of all I would like to 
thank my grandson, Jason, for 
allowing me to tell one of my 
favorite stories. If I may be al
lowed to digress for a moment, 
Jason has always been my favor
ite grandson and its a littleknown family secret that he was 
named after me; but not many 
people know this, because our 
names are so different. But then, 
Im sure you find an old mans 
waxing eloquence very uninter
esting, and Im not even sure why
I brought it up, except that I 
havent had the brain surgery yet. 
But I digress.
Whenever I see young people 
pitching woo to each other, I feel 
a special kind of feeling in my 
heart. To be sure, I am not what is 
known as a romantic, nor a wit, 
but I feel sure that this amusing 
tale will help to illustrate the folly 
which sometimes goes hand in 
hand with true love.
This amusing incident hap
pened when Iwasamereladof30 
or40.Iwas still too young to work 
in my fathers glue factory, so I 
had taken a job at kindly old Mr. 
Roberts taxidermy shop. Mr. 
Roberts was a good sort, and 
always very generous to any 
people, animals, or plants whom 
he might meet, and it was a rare 
day indeed that he did not meet 
any.
To my young eyes, he seemed 
to be always running into people
and things with his car and dis
cussing politics with them. I sup
pose the young people of today 
would call him a senile old luna
tic. In that day, though, we didnt 
have such colorful metaphors, and 
so we only insisted that he ring a 
bell as he walked down the street.
As I mentioned previously, 
though, he was a good sort. He 
evenpaidme steady wages, twelve 
cents a week, which in those days 
was practically nothing (however, 
after I had been working there for 
ten years, he raised my salary to 
fifteen cents, which just goes to 
show the value of hard work).
One summer I met a girl named 
Mary, who I thought (if I might be 
allowed the witticism) was the 
cats pajamas. I was highly grati
fied to discover that she felt the 
same way about me, in spite of 
the fact that she made me cover 
my head with a burlap bag when
ever we went out in public. I used
to invite her to all the big town 
events: the bam dances, the lynchings, the greased pig festivals, 
and the like.
One day, she saw a plate of 
gum drops in Mr. Morris candy 
store window. I wanted to buy one 
for her, but I had foolishly wasted 
my wages on a few rocks and 
rubber bands. I thought about 
borrowing the money from Mr. 
Roberts, but then I remembered 
what an awful thing it is to be in 
debt (a lesson which I often think 
about while making the monthly 
payments to the Luigi Brothers 
Finance Company). I decided to 
earn the money to buy the candy.
Without my parents knowing, 
I enrolled in night school. It was 
difficult, but I thought about 
Abraham Lincoln, and perse
vered. After fifteen years of hard 
work, I got my doctorate in nu
clear physics.
But, I was a wise enough young
lad to know not to rest on my lau
rels. I immediately set out to get 
a job at a nuclear power plant, - 
which was not an easy thing to do 
in 1928.
As a youth, I believed that K 
was crafty enough to have fooled 
my parents. But they were wide
awake people and I feel sure that 
they must have suspected some
thing, especially after I became 
radioactive.
Finally, after long and diligent 
work, I saved up enough money to 
buy a gum drop. Imagine my 
surprise when I found out that'1 
Mr. Morris Candy Store had 
burned to the ground and Mary 
had to leave town following a 
scandal.
What a laugh we had over that 
one."

Im not saying that we are 
squeamish, or that images of war 
are so thoroughly shocking that 
we recoil from them. After all, the

priving millions of topic hungry 
Americans the privilege of hav

Whether or not our efforts in Iraq 
are justified is not as tragic as the 
fact that for many, the conflict in

CMU student spends asemester as an intern in the city of politics
courtesy of American University
By DAN HOLLAND
Tartan Staffwriter
 The excitement built as I drove 
into Washington, D.C. for the 
beginning of a new semester. I 
suppose it was the thoughts of 
being away from Pittsburgh, 
exploring a new city, meeting 
fresh faces, and no more Carnegie 
Mellon. As I unpacked my clothes 
and books, I felt a new beginning. 
It was almost like being a fresh
man again  starting on a clean 
slate.
But I was a junior. I knew the 
routine: checkin, say hello, setup 
house, and wait for the work to 
begin.
It was January at the Tenley 
Campus of American University. 
It was the start of the 44th year of 
the Washington Semester Pro
gram, designed to allow students 
from'many schools around the 
world to study selected fields 
through a three-pronged, semi
nar, internship, andresearch proj
ect program for one semester. For 
those of us from the most aca
demically challenging schools to 
the party powerhouses, this was 
a chance to clear our heads from 
the dull routine of our home 
schools, see a new city, meet dif
ferent people, and experience a 
little bit of life. If that meant 
going to a bar once in a while, 
then so be it.
The Washington Semester is 
organized around seven different 
fields of study: American Politics, 
Economics, Foreign Policy, Jus
tice, Art and Architecture, Jour
nalism, and Peace and Conflict 
Resolution. I had chosen the larg
est and most popular program, 
American Politics, hoping that it 
would provide some direction to 
my misguided life. Besides, D.C. 
is the place for politics.
Each section engages in a three 
day a week seminar series which 
features guest speakers ranging 
from lobbyists and law clerks to 
congressmen and senators. The 
internship is two consecutive 
days, usually at the beginning or 
end of the week.
Finally, the research project, 
required for us at CMU, covers 
the entire semester, and should, 
ideally, reflect a semesters work. 
These three components sound 
like a lot but once you get the 
hang of it, the work becomes 
routine.
Before each seminar section 
there was a 20 minute Metro ride 
downtown which became all too
common. My professor, Dr. 
Christine DeGregorio, structured 
the seminars by the divisions of 
government: the judiciary, the 
legislative, and the executive 
branches, as well as interest 
groups and the media. Unfortu
nately, my expectations exceeded 
my first impressions.
The seminars started out slow 
and boring; just sit, listen, and 
take notes ... and maybe a few 
sleepy nods. But as the semester 
continued, the speakers became 
more exciting and more engag
ing.
Some of the more outstanding 
people we heard included: Ed
Meese, former Reagan aide and 
member of the Heritage Founda
tion; Alixe Glen, Bushs assistant 
deputy press aide; Congressman 
Bob Wise (D-W.Va.), Murray 
Dickman, assistant attorney 
general for the Civil Rights Divi
sion and CMU alum; Marty 
Franks, vice president for Wash
ington CBS, Inc.; Richard Cohen, 
columnist for The Washington 
Post and a staff correspondent 
with the National Journal; and 
Tony Mauro, a reporter for USA 
Today who covers the Supreme 
Court. *>*
On the last day in February, 
Congressman David Price 
(D-N.C.) invited us into his of
fice. He was friendly and spoke a 
bit slow, but not without his tef
lon shield. Price pulled out hi's 
wallet and showed us his elec
tronic voting card. My thoughts 
were racing. Wow, I thought. Will 
I ever hold one? Will this be My 
office? I had many questions astl 
sat in the office ofa U.S. congress
man.
The best part of the prograifi, 
academically, was the internship. 
This was a break from boring 
books and research, and a chance 
to get out into the real world. 
Plus, it was a great exercise 'in 
resume writing and interviewing, 
something we would have to~do 
all too soon.
I finally narrowed my search 
down to the U.S. Department of 
Commerce in the Office of Inter
governmental Affairs, the liason 
office between the states and the 
federal government. The woman 
who hired me hailed from Pitts
burgh  already my sentiments 
for home were wearing thin. yN
I rode the Metro on Thursday 
and Fridays at 8:30 am with itfy 
hair still damp and my suit'in 
need of a dry cleaning. I had a 
leather attache and tried to look 
professional. Yet, I was an intern 
 the lowest form of Washing
tonian life. Much of my intern
ship was spent at the photocopy 
or fax machines, or playing 'gdpher, but it included some r&Efl 
work, and there were perks. iTC>
I had a sense of autonomy arid I 
worked with the feeling that tins 
job was only a temporary step
ping stone to bigger and better 
things. I went to receptions wi|h 
free food and drink, and attended 
Congressional hearings and othSr 
official functions.
The highlight was a cordial 
meeting with Deputy Secretary 
of Commerce Thomas J. Murrfn. 
He is a former Westinghouse VS3 
and a guest speaker at CMUj so 
we had a common bond. Muriel 
sat nobly in his office overlook! 
the Mall and the White Housg, 
picking his teeth with a foldeH 
piece of paper, giving me a rather 
tepid view of Washington. Butat 
was worth the visit and the hand
shake.
The least pleasurable part^f 
the semester was the research 
project. We were supposed:;#} 
choose a topic prior to the semes
ter. But, as I found out from too 
many revisions and lack of direc
tion, the hardest part of research 
is deciding what to research, 'j;
I finally chiseled down my topic
I finally chiseled down my tope 
to A Case Study of the Steel 
Import Stabilization Act of1984} 
I interviewed legislative directors, 
congressional staffers, and lobby
ists, including the chief lobbyist 
for the steelworkers union wtjo 
offered me a summer job. TJie 
best advice I can give you is lov^r 
your expectations and dont count 
on researching what you origi
nally intend to. You may find some 
surprises along the way.
Naturally, the most outstand
ing and most memorable part^)f 
the semester was, by far, the life 
away from books and tests. While 
D.C. is a very clean, vibrant, his
toric city with romance (and 
yuppies), my lengthened stay 
removed its glamorous facade.-;
The homeless are at every MeJjo 
subway entrance with an out
stretched wrinkled hand. 
people ignore them, while a feiv 
plop down pennies or dimes irit&a 
tattered cup.
Gradually, I realized that people 
catch Potomac Fevr in their 
bloodthirsty quest for money. 
Despite the insipid heat sgjd 
humidity, Washington can be;/* 
very cold, shallow city. I was 
beginning to put CMU into per
spective. Its not so bad from" a 
distance.
But, for a semester of great 
memories, new friends, an im
pressive resume and transcript 
and a greater appreciation of this 
place we call hell, it was worth it.

Caroline Clark Hayes earnsworlds first robotics PhD
"Robotics is all about automation.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A Caroline Clarke Hayes
By TRUPTI PATELTartan Staffwriter
Caroline Clarke Hayes, a 
.member of the Robotics Institute 
faculty at Carnegie Mellon, re
cently became the first person ever 
4o receive a PhD in the field of ro
botics.
Although Hayes emanates a 
very down-to-earth attitude about 
fher work and her achievements, 
she has quite an impressive back
ground. She graduated from the 
University in 1983 with a BS de
gree in mathematics and comiputer science. When she gradu
ated, Hayes says, she had no in
tention of working in robotics and 
actually knew little about it.
Hayes continued her work at 
CMU in order to earn an MS 
degree in a program known as 
knowledge based systems. I was 
mainly interested in the artificial
intelligence field and the manu
facturing aspect of it. I decided to 
sort of create my own master's 
program, a type of interdiscipli
nary program, involvingmechanical engineering and computer 
science, says Hayes. The double 
masters program in mechanical 
engineering and computer science 
was dubbed the knowledge based 
systems masters when the two 
were combined.
Although mechanical engineer
ing and computer science are the 
areas of study which Hayes spe
cialized in, there are a vast array 
of fields which can lead one to a 
career in robotics. According to 
Hayes, there are people from 
almost every field of engineering, 
mathematics, computers, and 
even some from business and 
other specialties.
Working for two years with the 
Robotics Institute after obtaining
a masters degree is what really 
began to spark Hayes interest in 
the field of robotics. She explains 
that many people have a number 
of misconceptions about robotics 
itself simply because the general 
public is often uninformed about 
such topics.
Most of the students at CMU 
right now grew up on sciencefiction movies such as Star Wars 
and have come to believe that ro
botics involves the building of 
creatures such as the notorious 
R2-D2 and C-3P0.
However, Hayes states that 
although robotics does involve the 
use of robots, these robots are 
very different from the myths pro
longed by science-fiction block
buster films.
There are about five robotics 
laboratories scattered around 
Carnegie Mellon. The laboratory 
located in the rear section ofWean
Hall contains two different types 
of robots. According to Hayes, 
one of the robots is ingeniously 
built because of its precision. The 
robot does not have a moving 
arm, but simply has rotating 
tools which allow it to do accu
rate work without all the trouble 
of adding as many joints as there 
are in an armed robot.
Robotics is not just building 
robots though, says Hayes. It 
encompasses three different 
fields: artificial intelligence, ro
bots, and manufacturing. Robot
ics is all about automation.
Hayes speaks quite positively 
about the effects of increasing 
robotics technology on the jobs of
skilled workers in the United 
States and around the world. 
Machinists are very skilled work
ers who work in manufacturing, 
she says. What I did was observe 
machinists working and try to rec
reate their thought processes in a 
computer program for robots. How
ever, the machinist will still be 
vital to manufacturing because 
they are familiar with the tools 
used as well as with the use of the 
computer which controls the ro
bot.
I dont foresee [robots taking 
over skilled workers jobs]. If we 
ever even see such a thing happen, 
it will be a long, long time before it 
happens. The robot is a tool which
multiplies the amount of work a; 
machinist is able to do. It aug
ments a machinist's skill rather 
than replace it.
CMU began its degree program 
in robotics only one year ago. Ac
cording to Hayes, it is a quickly 
growing program with over 200 
faculty and staff members as well 
as $10 million in funding from 
national as well as local organiza
tions.
Although there are not any 
other PhDs in robotics, Hayes 
thinks that there are many people 
from other fields who have a great 
deal of knowledge about robotics 
and will perpetuate the success of 
the field.
The future looks good for this 
program, says Hayes. Especially 
when I was looking for jobs, I felt 
very much in demand. I think the 
graduates in this program are 
going to do very well.
Pagans dance in Hell as angels overpopulate the heavens
One fine day, Brother Jed and 
Sister Cindy showed up on my 
doorstep and asked me if I thought 
that the world was anywhere near 
ending. Of course, for the sake of 
fun, I told them that I completely 
agreed with them and that the 
world was on the verge of total 
collapse. However, before they 
could get in a word on the state of 
my soul, I gave them my reasons.
I mean, a pagan like myself 
cant get anywhere on this planet 
without being harassed by a bunch 
of sleazing little soul-savers. 
Personally, I cant wait until

point I smiled evilly, but I did.) 
You believe that through becom
ing a Gods Will Witness, one has 
opened the door to heaven for
ones soul. Is that correct?
Brother Jed nodded and looked 
at his wife, who seemed belliger
ently ready to command a holy 
lightning bolt to strike me down.
I continued.
How many of Gods Will Wit
nesses are there in the U.S. 
alone?
Over two million and risin, 
he drawled.
How many will be saved and 
taken up to heaven at the end of

One hundred and forty-four

But isnt heaven supposed to 
have room for two million? I 
asked.
And suddenly, you could almost 
see the rusty unused wheels start 
to turn in his mind, and the collar
on his new suit started to look 
very tight. His wife was cata

I looked at my watch. Well,

A Chorus Line kicks off the semester
By TERRI KASCHTartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Just one week into the fall 
j semester and already the cast and 
j crew of A Chorus Line are hop
ping.
Its Friday afternoon, and they 
have less than three weeks left to 
put this intricate, grand-scale 
musical together before the show 
opens for previews on September 
20.
At the center of all this action is 
(director John DeLuca, who never 
; seems to have a moment when 
j hes not in demand to solve a 
; problem or make a decision.
By late afternoon DeLuca looks 
slightly worn, and his voice is 
going, but these are the only indi
cations that he has spent all day 
in rehearsals and will get only an 
hour break before starting up 
again.
After working on the shows 
finale, One, with the entire cast, 
DeLuca goes into a smaller room 
with senior dramats Natascia 
Diaz and Mark Brettschneider, 
who play Cassie and Zach.
The two actors rehearse a scene 
and, as they are about to leave, 
Brettschneider turns to DeLuca 
and asks, What are we doing 
tonight, John?
DeLuca seems not to under
stand the question. He waits a 
beat before responding. Rehears
ing. Then he adds playfully, 
What do you want to do? Do you 
want to go out? Do you want to get 
a beer?
While going out on a Friday 
night is not unusual for most 
students, it is a ludicrous thought 
for these CFA juniors and sen
iors. They have too much work to 
do, and so little time.
Im sure someplace somewhere 
they do Chorus Line in a week, 
DeLuca says, shaking his head. 
Im sure it happens.
DeLuca would prefer to have
more time, but he remains confi
dent that everyone will be ready 
come opening night. Four weeks 
would be ideal. We have three 
and well just do it.
It helps that DeLuca already 
knows the show well. In 1978 he 
joined the cast ofA Chorus Line in 
the role of Greg, and stayed with 
the show for several months. 
However, he remembers having 
little freedom to interpret the 
character in his own way.
Its hard when youre recast
ing a show, keeping it fresh, keep
ing it alive and still remaining 
close to the original so they tried 
to make the [new] people do the
same things that the original 
people did... every gesture, it was 
really inhibiting.
Although DeLuca saw ways to 
improve the show, he was unable 
to experiment as a cast member. 
Now, as director, he can do it the 
way that I want to do it. This 
includes changing parts of the 
choreography that he has wanted 
to alter since starring in the 
musical.
Other changes were made out 
of necessity. Since A Chorus Line 
requires many people to dance on 
stage together, Kresge was a little 
small for a standard production. 
We cut two characters, Connie
and Don. Theyre both easily cut 
and otherwise we couldnt fit them 
across the stage, DeLuca says.
However, he sees this as a re
turn to the roots of A Chorus Line 
the original production in New 
York was also done in a small 
theater, about the size of Kresge. 
So this will be like the original, 
original Chorus Line.
Working with students as op
posed to professionals does not 
really make a difference in 
DeLucas approach to directing. 
Indeed, this is not his first experi
ence working with students. He 
taught dance at Boston Univercontinued on page L13
Phil Collins gets Serious
By MICHAEL T. ROSETartan Managing Editor
Dont believe all those nasty things 
you hear about Phil Collins.
Sure, hes incredibly rich, riding 
the profits from his group efforts, hit 
solo albums and countless sound
track tunes. Sure, he has a tendency 
to blow off the band that made him 
famous (thats Genesis, folks) when 
its original lead singer (Peter Gab
riel) left for stranger, greener pas
tures. Sure, hes irreverent and his 
music occasionally has a fluffy, in
substantial feel. All that granted, 
the man can still put on an incred
ible show, as he proved last Wednes
day at the Star Lake Amphitheater.

of his latest album But Seriously, is 
anything but. He soared though most 
of his recent material with his trade
mark energy, shining especially on 
new songs like Another Day In 
Paradise and the infectious Some
thing Happened On The Way To 
Heaven. With his new band, Collins 
sounded less like an aging crooner/ 
drummer and more like the rakehell 
heard on early Genesis songs like 
The Cage and Turn It On.
He also managed to include a 
generous helping of his older mate
rial, including the anti-anthem In 
The Air Tonight with a spectacular, 
pounding double percussion riff 
(performed by Collins and longtime 
drum partner Chester Osborne), and 
his popular cover of the Supremes 
You Cant Hurry Love.
Although some of Collins songs 
tend to sound the same live as they 
do on record, many do get changed 
for performance. He treated the 
audience to a balladized version of 
Doesnt Anybody Stay Together 
Anymore, a catchy but overly loudand-fast cut from his No Jacket Required album. On stage he performed

Hotlicks burns up the competition
 Restaurant Review 
???V2 HOTLICKS. Located at the Motor Square Garden on Walnut Street. 
Appetizers range from $2.95 to $7.95; salads $2.95 to $6.25; sandwiches 
$2.50 to $5.95; entrees $4.15 to $19.95. Call 363-8333 for hours.
By DAWN BROSONSKITartan Asst. Diversions Editor
When you walk down Walnut 
Street -towards Hotlicks, you can 
smell the ribs at least half a block 
away. Its more than enough to make 
you forget where you were going and 
march right in for some of the best 
food youve ever had.
At Hotlicks, youre treated to fast, 
friendly service. You can begin your 
meal with an appetizer (though the 
plate of chips and salsa you receive 
upon seating may be plenty). There 
is a pleasing variety, from vegetables 
to chili to chicken nachos.
If you want to spend a little less 
money and eat a little less than the 
average entree, Hotlicks offers a 
selection of salads and sandwiches. 
Play it safe and have a chicken or 
steak salad, or try something new in 
a grilled swordfish salad; mesquite 
grilled swordfish served on a bed of 
mixed greens, with red onion, olives, 
and cheddar cheese.
The sandwiches are hearty meals
in themselves, served with Hotlicks 
own homemade potato chips (deli
cious!). Be tempted with a mesquite 
chicken sandwich, a hot vegetarian, 
or perhaps a chicken burrito. There 
are nine varieties of sandwiches in 
all.
On to the specialty! Yes, its the 
ribs, and they are deservedly the 
pride and joy of this establishment. 
Hotlicks ribs are meaty and tender. 
In preparation they are tenderized, 
smoked with mesquite wood, and 
coated in barbeque sauce while on 
the grill.
Then comes the pleasure of choos
ing from three barbeque sauces: 
Mild, Hotlicks, and Zebs Screamin 
Killei-Wilier Sauce, rumored to be 
THE re-hot sauce for rib-lovers in
Pittsburgh. Warning: it lives up to 
this reputation. Stock your table with 
plenty of water glasses in case of 
emergencies.
As far as the ribs go, you can choose 
a half or a whole rack of regular or 
Monster ribs. Only choose Monster 
ribs if you take the saying I could 
eat a whole side of beef literally. 
Theres also barbequed or marinated 
chicken to try. A personal favorite of 
mine is the combo, which offers a 
sample of both ribs and chicken, 
coated in your choice of sauce.
If youre not in the mood for ribs, 
Hotlicks also offers fresh fish en
trees, with a fresh catch offered daily. 
And if all that doesnt appeal, you 
can always have a burger.

CMU mourns the loss of a theater
;By MIKE SHAPIRO
iTartan Staffwriter 
;and DAWN BROSONSKITartan Asst. Diversions Editor
' MCS Junior Kurt Schaefer is 
asked if he ever frequented the 
King's Court Theater in Oakland.
Yeah, all the time. I used to go 
down there a lot. I havent been 
there in a while. Ive been mean
ing to go.
I Schaefer is informed that the 
itheater closed in July.
| Youre kidding me! Just last 
night I said to my friend, Hey, we 
should go down to Kings Court; 
we havent seen Rocky Horror in a 
long time. I cant believe it!
! Located smack in the midst of 
Pitts semi-sprawling campus, 
and a javelins throw from CMU, 
the Kings Court Theater was an 
age-old source of cinematic enter
tainment, as well as a social focal 
point of the Oakland area. Though 
unquestionably grungy, the thea
ter had a pervasive, eccentric 
charm. Nothing exemplified this 
more than its unique interior 
decor, with details ranging from 
the ancient posters that Uttered 
;the walls to the armored breast
plates that served as makeshift
lamp-shades.
The theater devoted its week
ends to performances of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, a long-time 
favorite of college students. The 
shows featured live actors, often 
local students, in lavish costume, 
and paralleling the on-screen 
action with scrupulous accuracy.
But on July 19, the theaters 
lease expired. The owners chose 
not to renew the lease, explained 
Jeff Lewine, president of Cinema 
World, the movie agency that 
utilized Kings Court. They de
cided that they wanted more 
money than a movie theater could 
give them. Lewine cited rising 
rent costs as another probable 
factor that led to the owners 
decision.
Disbelief seems to be the popu
lar reaction among CMU stu
dents. Kings Court was a mere
15-minute walk from campus, and 
with its demise, students are left 
with only two other theaters to 
choose from: The Manor and the 
Squirrel Hill Theater.
There were the occasional sour 
comments from CMU students 
about the theater. Its not a great 
tragedy, said GSIA graduate 
student Dave Greene. I never
thought of Kings Court as being 
part of anyones college experi
ence.
And a student who chose to re
main anonymous offered more 
bluntly, They only showed one 
movie, and they would show it for 
like three months. They played 
bad movies, and I never went 
there.
Many made a point of remark
ing on the theaters unsanitary 
conditions andjust howmuchthey 
would not be missed.
The floor always had movie 
grub all over it, remarked H&SS 
Junior Joseph Traub. It was not 
a clean place.
But for the most part, CMU stu
dents seem very disappointed and 
even angry about the loss of the 
closest theater to campus.
I was so upset when it closed! 
exclaimed H&SS Senior Elynor 
Helman. It was so close by. Where 
are we going to see Rocky Horror 
now?
I think its too bad that its 
closed, said H&SS Junior Susan 
Gondran. Its a historic building 
thats been used for theater for a 
longtime. CIT Senior JadNehme 
remarked, It was a place me and 
my friends used to go together. It
was, for me, sort of a student life 
thing.
Im sorry it closed, added 
Joseph Traub. Its a shame to see 
it go, since it was so close to CMU. 
But theres not much we can do 
now.
Weve effectively cut our selec
tion of films within walking dis
tance back by a third, commented 
H&SS Junior Rick Harris. At 
least as far as mainstream mov
ies go. Now you really need to get 
access to a car to get out to 
Monroeville, for example, to get a 
wide selection of films.
Some cited the Courts crowded, 
boisterous nature as a virtue to be 
missed. Im from Philadelphia, 
commented CIT Senior LeRoy 
Jones, and Im used to the rowdy 
crowds. It was a lot like home.
But by far, the most popular 
comments concerned the loss of 
the only nearby venue for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Now 
there is no location in Pittsburgh 
that runs Rocky. I think its re
ally sad that Rocky Horror isnt 
going to be shown near here any
more, observed CFA Senior Me
linda Klump.
I never got to see Rocky Horror, lamented H&SS Freshman
Jason Digman/Tartan Photographer
kings Court, the now-defunct movie theater that so many students 
frequented over the years, now stands abandoned and up for rent.
Heather Broud. I met about five 
friends here who told me how 
great it was.
Its been very annoying for me, 
said MCS Junior Tom Smith. I
took last year off, and came back 
just as the theater closed. I really 
miss Rocky. I spent last year learn
ing all the parts, and now its 
gone. And I want it back again!

An Oscar for The Donald?
First there was Tarzan, the Ape Man, the one where she said I 
think Ill take a bath now and 
wouldnt let Miles OKeefe talk.
Then there was Bo Lero, the 
one where she spent two hours 
trying to get rid of her virginity 
and finally told a matador I will 
make that thing work again. (The 
matador had been gored by a bull.)
And now, just when you thought 
it was safe to braid your hair 
again, comes the finest collabora
tion between a husband and wife 
team since Ferdinand and Imelda 
discovered Geneva bank accounts.
You know what I'm talking 
about. Its Bo. Shes bodacious. 
After six years of silence, Bo Is it 
time to get nekkid again, John? 
Derek returns to the big screen 
with the most sensitive portrayal 
of her career: Ghosts Cant Do It.
When you see that title, if youre 
like me, you think, Does that 
mean ... nawwwwww, it couldnt 
mean that. What do you think? 
Naw, that would be stupid.
So I should tell you right up 
front: it means what you think it 
means.
But thats not whatll get you 
about this movie. The more im
portant thing is:
Bos co-star is Anthony Quinn? 
I had to get inside the drive-in 
before I found this out, though, 
because Anthony Quinns name 
is not on the poster, not on the 
marquee, not on the press kit  
its almost like someone said,
. Take Anthony Quinns name off 
this movie. People dont wanna 
see that guy. They wanna see Bo. 
Anyway, as I was about to tell 
you, the husband-wife team of Bo

you anyhow:
Bo Derek and Anthony Quinn
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
are married, living on a ranch in 
Montana, but Tony keeps falling 
off his horse, and then Bo lets him 
bite her lip like a horse until he 
feels better. He wants to know 
what shell do if he dies.
I will not cry, I will not wear 
ugly black, and I will go forward 
with your strength, she says 
while wearing a designer ski cap 
and a fur parka.
Next thing, they find out An
thony cant get a new heart, be
cause hes too old. So Bo dresses 
up in an Indian blanket and sits 
in the snow until Anthony wants 
to bite her lip again.
The Bo puts on a silver fox hat 
with the fox-head still on it.
Then they go cross-country 
skiing and Anthony gets out of 
breath.
Youre scaring me, Great One, 
says Bo.
Im not making up this dialogue.
Then one night, in bed, Anthony 
cant make the sign of the triplegilled attack weasel. He cant even 
make the sign of the sea slug. So 
he kills himself with a shotgun 
and leaves her a suicide note: 
You always said that you would 
forgive me.
Bo starts crying and-says, Its 
not necessary that you love me 
and hold me, Great One.
It gets worse.
In Purgatory, Anthony starts 
flirting with a bimbo angel with a
butterfly strapped to her 
hand.They watch Anthonys fu
neral, where Bo shows up with a 
couple of dead poodles on her head. 
He cant stand it anymore, so he 
appears to Bo. She tells him all 
she does is take care of her teddy 
bears and cats and watch her 
Great One on videos all day long.
You couldhave taken the pills, 
she tells him.
Real men dont eat quiche, he 
answers.
Next thing, Bo decides to do what 
most widows do  go to the 
Maldive Islands and scuba-dive 
in a coral reef. She jumps up and 
down on the beach, rips off her 
bathing suit, and starts scream
ing at Anthony. She wants sex, 
she says.
Ghosts cant do it, he tells her. 
Its that simple.
Youblew your head off! I didnt! 
she screams back at him.
All the guys enjoy watching Bo 
jumping up and down nekkid 
screaming like a madwoman. They 
dont know that Anthony Quinn is 
talking back to her through one of 
those LSD camera lenses that 
looks like they smeared Vaseline 
and cranberry juice on it.
Then this hunkaroonie named 
Leo Damian sees her sunbonnet 
with colored beads, on it and falls 
in love. Unfortunately, Leo 
Damian has the personality of a 
grapefruit.
Are you romancing me? she 
asks him.
Yes, your beauty demands it.
Next, she stores her two-billiondollar pearls in a safe hiding place 
and takes a bath.
Anthony begs her to zap him 
and use his body  meaning kill 
Leo Damian so Anthony can seep 
into his hunky bod from Purga
tory.
So Bo goes out on a raft and discusses it with Leo. My dead
husband wants to possess your 
body, she tells him, adjusting 
her sunhat and shades.
Now Don Murray show up, still 
looking for his first decent role 
since Bus Stop, and explains to 
Bo why Anthony had to blow his 
head off: What else could he do? 
He loved Hemingway.
Theres more.
Time to get to Hong Kong.
Time to get to Hong Kong for a 
business meeting with Donald 
Trump!
Yes, its really him!
Are you following this?
They sit across this big board
room conference table, and Bo 
says, This city will be reduced to 
dust before you best me.
Youre too pretty to be bad, 
says The Donald.
You noticed? says Bo.
Then Bo and Don Murray start 
dancing on a wharf, skinny-dip a 
little, and then she says Will you 
kiss me?
Next thing, a guy with a gun 
breaks into Bos hotel room and 
forces her to take sleeping pills, 
so shell miss her big meeting 
with Donald Trump, but Don 
Murray shows up in time to slap 
her back awake.
Time to go back to the Maldive 
Islands! Bo flies the plane her
self, and tells Don Murray, The 
Great One is here in the plane 
with us, and he thinks love is 
our word.
The Bo gets doused with water 
and dances for the natives, until 
the Catholic priest screams out 
In Gods name, I command you 
to stop! and calls her a shedevil.
Then Bo puts on a straw hat 
and rides around on an elephant.
Then some tourists come on a 
train to see Bos two-billion-dol
lar pearls.
Then a White Witch shows up
Bo Is it time to take a bath again, John? Derek in an electrifying 
moment from Ghosts Can't Do It.
and says: Is he looking for a 
body?
Then Bo mixes up a rat-poisonand-papaya-juice cocktail and 
gives it to Leo Damian, but before 
Leo drinks it, he pulls a machine 
gun and steals her pearls. Bo has 
to kung fa him on a pool table, but 
at the last minute, she decides 
not to kill him. Anthony is very 
p.o.ed.
Im outta here. Im history, 
Anthony tells her.
In order to console herself, Bo 
plunges her head in the hot tub.
He has my heart, she says. 
How can I five without a heart? 
Anthonys bimbo tells him, 
Theres no way out of eternity. 
Youre stuck with it.
So then Bo tells Anthony that; 
okay, sure, she wants to kill Left.
It could mean hell forevei! 
Anthony tells her.
Were going for it! shouts Bo.

For DeLuca, constantly switch

does not phase him. Its like 
changing skin. A different part of 
me comes out.... I love what Im 
doing, whatever Im doing. You 
know, when Im playing tennis, 
Im nothing else but a tennis 
player. Im not thinking about 
cooking or shopping or acting or

After A Chorus Line the future 
remains uncertain for DeLuca. 
Ill be totally honest and totally 
humble and say I dont know. I 
dont know whats happening next

excitement and with a kind of

shows planned for the Kresge 
Theatre this year. Following ChorusLineis the Sophocles trag
edy Antigone, which arrives at 
Kresge in mid-November. Here, 
the story of a woman and her 
brother challenging a political 
system comes to the stage under 
the direction of Yossi Yzraely.
In February, CFA presents the 
Stephen Sondheim musical Into The Woods. This charming show 
brings characters from the fairy 
tails Cinderella, Little Red Rid
ing Hood, Rupunzel, and Jack and the Beanstalk all into one 
story.
Finally, the season comes to an 
end with director and choreogra
pher Billy Wilson staging Jesus Christ Superstar. Wilson, a 
member ofthe drama faculty, last 
showed his talent with the 1989 
musical revue I Hear America Singing. Superstar was written 
by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim 
Rice and tells of Christs followers 
during the last days of his life.
Tickets and season passes are 
available by phone or by visiting 
the CFA box office, so set aside 
four evenings during the year to 
see some unforgettable theater.
Collins gets Serious at Star Lake
continued from page LU
song that improved drastically on 
the original. Collins is a singer 
who sounds good at any volume, 
but his emotional power and range 
are enhanced when he quiets 
down.
 Other updates didnt fare so 
well. Collins did perform some of 
his well-known duets with standifts from his backup group, and 
the results were mixed. On Sepa
rate Lives (originally performed 
with Marilyn Martin on the
soundtrack to White Nights), the 
song came out quite nicely if a bit 
subdued, but on Easy Lover 
(originally performed with Phil
lip Bailey of Earth, Wind, and 
Fire fame) the two backup men 
called in for the difficult high parts 
simply couldnt match the ex
travagant falsetto of the recorded 
version.
Collins stage show takes place 
on a primarily white set that is 
given color and character by one 
of the finest light shows in con
temporary music. Collins utilizes 
the same VariLight systems seen 
on the most recent Genesis tour, 
and the results are fairly spec
tacular. Beams and bright spots 
circle, whirl and shift colors in 
exact programmed synchrony 
with the music, resulting in dis
plays and effects that had the 
audience hypnotized.
Even though most of Star Lakes 
seats are too far from the stage 
to see much of the individual per
formers, the highly visible video
monitors let the audience follow 
most of Collins stage patter. He 
was genially funny, introducing 
six consecutive band members as 
returning to their hometown of 
Pittsburgh.
Collins may not be the first art
ist you think of for an open-air 
concert, but he gave the crowd 
their moneys worth. With the Star 
Lake season rolling to a close this 
month, he showed us that sum
mer pop can still hold up this 
close to Labor Day.

Show me the 
way to Star Lake
By MICHAEL T. ROSETartan Managing Editor
Tired of the Civic Arena, 
Syria Mosque, and Graffiti? 
The Star Lake Ampitheatre, 
Pittsburghs newest concert 
venue, is certainly the most 
uniquemusicalsettingintown. 
It features a respectable stage 
complex fronted by a small 
reserved section with real 
seats. Behind that, the seating 
arrangements are slightly less 
formal, as the bowl of the 
amphitheater stretches up into 
a massive general admission 
area  the tickets are marked 
lawn, and thats exactly what 
you sit on.
You quickly get used to sit
ting on the grass at Star Lake; 
on a clear night the twinkling 
points overhead beautifully 
complement the music. Advice: 
bring a blanket, bring binocu
lars (Star Lake rents goodones 
for $5 a pair), be prepared for 
inclement weather (sorry, no 
umbrellas allowed  but they 
do sell ponchos), and come early 
for good seats  once it gets 
dark you risk stepping on 
people.
In fact, youd better come 
early anyway. Although Star 
Lake is architecturally pleas
ant and acoustically adequate, 
its a good forty minutes jour
ney by car from the CMU 
campus, andthelimited-access 
parking available means that 
traffic backs up for some dis
tance along the highway be
fore you get to the parking lots. 
(Helpful hint: the right lane 
will back up first. Ignore it. 
Stay in the fast-movingleft lane
until you see a trooper waving 
cars onto the access ramp for 
parking.)
Star Lake encourages car 
pooling by giving free parking 
to cars with at least four pas
sengers, so bring friends. Con
certs usually start at 7:30 pm; 
if you dont leave campus by 6 
or so you risk missing the start 
of the show, and you certainly 
wont be anywhere near the 
stage if youre sitting on the 
lawn. This, by the way, is an improvementwhenBillyJoel 
inaugurated the new facility 
this summer, the bumperbundle was so bad that some 
people who were on the road at 
7:30 missed the entire show 
while sitting in their cars.
The next performer coming 
to Star Lake is the perfect man 
for the jobJames Taylor. He 
will be hosting a party under 
the stars on Saturday, Septem
ber 15 at 7:30 pm. Seats are 
available at National Record 
Mart or by calling 333-SEAT 
(reserved, $26.50; general ad
mission, $23.50).
PhilCollinsconcert last Wed
nesday was punctuated early 
on by lightning flashes in the 
clouds behind the stage, light
ing up the dark sky as if to 
announce the concert to the 
neighborhood like megawatt 
searchlights. With luck (and 
an early start) you can see 
James Taylor and a few more 
artists brave the great outdoors 
before the falling mercury 
closes Star Lake for the season. 
In any case, if they arent going 
to use it in the winter, that 
sloped grass bowl would make 
an incredible traying run.

Escape from the generic video game
Video games are a wonderful thing. 
They help you relieve stress (or create it, 
depending on which games you play), 
theyre fun to watch, and, most impor
tantly, theyre awfully fun to play. 
However, theres one small problem with 
most video games these days  theyre 
pointless, mindless, and stupid.
Now dont get me wrong, there are 
plenty of challenging and thought-pro
voking games out there. The problem is 
weeding those gems out from others that 
were written for that eight year-old kid 
who just saw Batman for the two-hundredth time. Thats where I come in.
I will attempt to. track down a few of 
these games (on every single system 
currently on the market) which a college 
audience would find interesting and 
worth buying, and then report my find
ings to you. I will also try to provide 
thoughtful and truthful insight about 
these games, as opposed to the tickytacky that most of those video game 
magazines dish out to you. And now that 
the introductions are out of the way, lets 
get on with the show....
First up to bat is a gem of a game for 
the Nintendo system, Solstice. The story 
is your basic story  guy gets girl, guy 
loses girl to evil sorcerer, guy must find 
and kill evil sorcerer to get girl back. 
However, what makes this game truly
PRESS START
by Stephen Glicker
different from other games of this genre 
is the way in which you must get the girl 
back.
Instead ofthe usual hacking and slash
ing through hoards of beasties found in 
so many games of this type, all you have 
to do in Solstice is navigate through 
more than 250 various rooms, solve 
puzzles and avoid dangers while you 
search for the six pieces of the Staff of 
Demnos which is needed to destroy the 
evil sorcerer.
Each room in Solstice poses a different 
challenge. In some rooms all that is 
required of you is to decide which door 
you would like to exit through. However, 
most rooms arent this kind. Most of the 
rooms consist of patrolling guards, float
ing platforms, and poisonous spikes 
which line the floor from wall to wall. All
are depicted in a 3-D perspective, which 
is a pleasure to look at, but takes awhile 
to get used to when it comes to navigat
ing through via the control pad.
Another nice touch is the Magic Map 
feature, which is just an overhead map of 
all the rooms youve traveled through. It 
might not sound like much, but this little 
feature will save you hours of mapping 
with the old-fashioned pen and paper.
For a Nintendo game the graphics and 
animation are pretty amazing. The col
ors are crisp (I havent seen a flicker on 
the screen once) and the characters move 
with astonishing smoothness. Solstice is 
up there with Batman and Super Mario Brothers 3 when it comes to the graphics 
department.
Now, Ive never been a big fan of the 
monaural sound capabilities found on 
the Nintendo system, however, Solstice 
seems to be the exception to the rule. To 
put it in a nutshell, the music is spec
tacular. Like most games, Solstice has 
only a few songs which are played over 
and over again as background music, but 
unlike most games, you probably wont 
get bored after listening to the music for 
the six hundredth time. If Solstice had 
an album soundtrack Id buy it.
The game has a continue feature which 
is dependent on the player. Throughout 
the game there are coins that will allow
you to continue the game, but you must 
continue from the room in which you 
found the coin. There are about six or so 
coins which can be found throughout the 
game, all of which are placed in fairly 
convenient locations, so as not to make 
your life too hellish.
The only real problem I found in the 
game, besides the use of the controller 
throUgh-the 3-D rooms, is the fact that 
the game doesnt take all that long to 
win. It only took me about a week of 
intense play to win this game, but that 
week might become more like amonth or 
. so for the average college student with a 
full load of schoolwork.
If you go to any Games & Gadgets (in 
Century III or Monroeville Mall), you 
can purchase Solstice for only $30, $15 
off the regular price. This offer is only 
good until September 9.
For the final evaluation, on a scale of 
one to ten I give the graphics a seven, the 
sound and music a ten, and the playabil
ity an eight. Overall I give Solstice an 
eight.
Tune in next week for a review of Populus for the Sega Genesis system.
Tartan Diversions Editor Stephen Glicker does participate in other semisocial activities besides video games. We think.
Hotlicks 
offers the 
ultimate ribs
continued from page Lll
Dont forget to have some dessert, 
if you have any room left. Go for the 
traditional hot fudge sundae, or 
sample some hot apple cinnamon 
pie. Whatever you choose, it will be 
the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
The only thing about Hotlicks that 
isnt perfect is the space it occupies. 
This restaurant does not boast an 
ideal location, being tucked into a 
tight comer of the Motor Square 
Garden building. There are about 
eleven tables downstairs, with only 
three or four upstairs. Sometimes 
you cant help feeling like someone 
elses ribs are staring over your 
shoulder. During rush, the backlog 
of people waiting for tables can be 
distracting, since they have to stand 
so close by, lined up near the dining 
area and on the stairs.
Dont let this deter you. Hotlicks 
is within walking distance from cam
pus and will give you high-quality 
food at reasonable prices. Get there 
early and enjoy all this restaurant 
has to offer.
ARE YOU AN A.C.O.A.? 
Is Someone Close to You An A.C.O.A.?
Adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) seldom acknowledge the pain they experience as children. They groe 
up believing that feelings of anger or sadness are wrong, and they learn to suppress their rmemories and 
repress their emotions. Recovery requires that they find the truth about their childhood, and experience the 
feelings that the truth stirs up.
Roseanne Hickey and Glen Sherman from the Carnegie Mellon Counseling Center will present a short 
video about life as a child of an alcoholic. They will also name resources, on and off campus, which can 
facilitate A.C.O.A. recovery. All members of the campus community are invited.

In the small town of Flint, Michigan, just about 
everyone is employed at the local General Motors 
factory. Life couldnt be better in Flint, until one 
day the unthinkable happens  the plant shuts 
down. Without the General Motors factory, thou
sands of unemployed people panic.
That is, all-except for one man: Michael Moore. 
Instead, Moore steps out of the crowd and with fiery 
determination vows to confront Roger Smith, Gen
eral Motors chairman, and give him a piece of his 
mind.
The film, shot mostly by Moore himself, displays 
how imperative labor relations are in order to avoid 
recessions within a community and tension amongst 
workers. Not since Norma Jean has a film truly 
exposed the economic hardships of the working 
class. Catch this highly controversial movie if you 
can.

For those dissatisfied with the video game, the 
comic books, the television show, the Burger King 
cups, and everything else sporting Michelangelos 
good looks, heres Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
The Movie. The screen production answers the 
questions the American public has been asking for 
months  how did these turtles get a black belt in 
martial arts, how did they learn to talk, and how 
did they acquire such a taste for pizza? Set to the 
rap music of Partners in Crime and Technotronic, 
Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo 
perform death-defying stunts fighting the powers 
of evil while at the same time stressing the simple 
theme that good guys always win.
Shell out those four quarters you were saving for 
the arcade and head over to DH 2210.

Who says money cant buy love? Richard Gere 
portrays an affluent businessman who has just 
broken up with his girlfriend. Soon after, he meets 
a prostitute, played by beautiful Julia Roberts, and 
becomes intrigued with her looks and refreshing 
personality. He signs a check for $3,000 and buys 
her companionship for a week. Over time he trans
forms her into an elegant woman and she, in turn, 
changes his views on relationships and commit
ment. Although the plot is the basic Prince Charm
ing meets Cinderella, the characters are refresh
ing and the chemistry between Gere and Roberts is 
perfect. The soundtrack also shines with music by 
such artists as Go West, Roxette, and the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers.

Has Darth Vaders husky voice been on your 
mind lately? Princess Leias hairdo? Or how about 
that little green guy, Yoda? If you crave only to 
learn more of these characters, then weve got the

space adventure starring Mark Hamill, Harrison 
Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams, in his

Hut is still hunting him down. If the characters and 
action arent enticing enough for you there are 
always the 1980 Oscar-winning special effects to 
help keep you spellbound. Let The Force guide you
