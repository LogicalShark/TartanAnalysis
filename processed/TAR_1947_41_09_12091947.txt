New Alma Mater Still 
On Trial-Dr. Doherty
Versions of Alma Mater Topic of Discussion 
At Presidents Student Conference Dinner
The new version of the Alma 
Mater is still on trial, and if it 
does not pass muster with the stu
dents it certainly will not be ac
cepted, said President Robert E. 
Doherty at a dinner meeting of 
the Student Conference commit
tee held Wednesday evening, De
cember 3.
Although the Alma Mater oc
cupied the main portion of the 
evenings discussion, the meeting 
of the president and a number 
of student activities leaders found 
time to discuss and propose for 
further investigation an injury 
compensation plan for intramural 
football, some unfavorable 
changes in ground rules for the 
coming Pitt-Theta Xi intramural 
championship football game, and 
shortages of athletic equipment.
The public speaking aspect of 
the social relations program also 
came under discussion, as good 
food and the relatively small num
ber present made the meeting the 
most pleasant and informal of the 
year.
Running comments on the Alma 
Mater began when Council pres
ident George Marshall stated: The 
students like the new music,' but 
not as an Alma Mater.
Dr. Doherty replied that he had 
heard similar opinions.
Some parts are almost bril
liant, he said, and it is off the 
beaten track. But it is still too 
much.
The Alma Mater should be sim
ple and yet distinguished.
In defining the requirements 
for the ideal song for the pur
pose, the president noted that 
simplicity is the key to a good 
Alma Mater. It must be something 
that sticks in your mind.
Reinforcing the presidents opin
ion, George Bickerstaff, president 
of Interfraternity council, ex
plained that the Kiltie Band was 
unanimously against the new ver
sion.
They sort of liked the old mel
ody, he noted.
After other members of the com
mittee had indicated similar 
opinions, Dr. Doherty summed up 
one of the more troublesome mis
takes made in solving the prob
lem, attaching new music to old 
words, and outlined a tentative 
plan for testing the new melody 
before a final decision is made.
The Glee club will try it and
see what they think. If their opin
ion is negative, then that would 
presumably end it. But if they do 
like it, then it will be given to the 
students once again at a big as
sembly.
The president emphasized that 
both the new music for the Alma 
Mater and the method of obtain
ing the campus opinion of it are 
tentative, and that he is still in
terested in further suggestions as 
to a course of action.
When the subject of compensa
tion for injuries received during 
touch football games was intro
duced, the point was made that 
the injured players themselves 
are now bearing the burden of

CIT Meets 
Grove City
Opening Game of Year 
Will Be Played Wed.
Swinging into a nineteen game 
basketball season, the 1947-48 
edition of the C.I.T. quintet will 
entertain Grove City tomorrow 
night, in the gymnasium. It will 
be the opening game for both 
teams.
Last years tussle with Grove 
City proved to be the Tartans 
only decisive victory in an other
wise dismal season. This year 
however, Coach Bill Donahoe and 
his assistant Mel Cratsley have 
a potentially good team which 
may need only a spirited student 
bodys support to start it off on a 
successful season.
The following Saturn v night 
will find the Skibo courtmen tak
ing the floor against Westminster. 
The Titans, considered to be one 
of the finer basketball squads in 
Pennsylvania, twice topped CIT 
last year.
Coach Donohoes charges will 
return these visits by traveling to 
Grove City and to New Wilming
ton later in the season.
All home games will be played 
in the gymnasium and will start 
at 8:30. The students idtentification card will serve as an admis
sion ticket.
Tartan Notice
Promotions in all depart
ments of the Tartan staff with 
the exception of the business 
department will be announced 
at a meeting to be held at 7:30 
p. m. Friday, December 12, 
in the newspaper office in the 
Union.
A lecture on the writing of 
summary leads for news and 
sports stories will also be giv
en at this time, and opportunity 
will be provided to ask ques
tions concerning problems met 
in journalistic writing and in 
the coverage of beats and as
signed stories.
Council Elections 
Set For Dec. 18
Three CIT Magazines 
Appear In One Week
Cano9 Technical, Scottie Staffs Publish 
In Quick Succession; Pitt Gets Leftovers
This is Publications Week for Carnegies three magazines 
the Technical, the Scottie, and Cano. Cano appears today, the Tech
nical tomorrow, and the Scottie on Wednesday, December 17.
Cano will be replete with the best in student creative writing, 
plus Classroom Thoughts on Teaching Literature by Dr. John A. 
Hart of the English Department. Student contributions include

shopping, posed by Dave Crantz 
and Bob Chalander, and an old 
fashioned girl gowned in the style 
of the new look, in its Christmas 
issue.
The Tau Beta Pi edition of the 
Technical will present two articles 
on the engineers relation to so
ciety entitled Your Responsibil
ity for Atomic Energy Control, 
and Should Engineers form 
Unions?
The magazines will all be sold 
in the foyer of Skibo and Admin
istration hall, with Cano priced 
ten cents and the others a quarter. 
The Scottie and the Technical will 
also invade Pitt.
Free Dances 
Follow Games
Dorm Women Receive 
Extra 11:30 Privilege
Free informal dances in Thistle 
hall after five of this seasons 
home basketball games will be 
sponsored by Alpha Phi Omega, 
national service fraternity, under 
a plan worked out last week. Dor
mitory women will receive 11:30 
permissions to attend these func
tions.
The first dance of the series, 
upon which the fate of the other 
four depends, will be held after 
tomorrows game against Grove 
City. Dancing will start immedi
ately after the game ends and will 
continue until 11:15.
The administration was re
quested to permit the dormitory 
hours to be advanced to 12:30 for

6Tecvets Has Served Its Need 
Harry Thor9 Jack Steiner Agree
Half Of Offices Open; Petitions Must 
Be Completed Week Before Balloting
An all-school election to elect members of Student Coun
cil for the coming spring and fall semesters will be held 
Thursday, December 18, between 11:30 a. m. and 1:30 p. m. 
at polling places in each of the three colleges.
Robert Shapiro, chairman of the Elections committee of 
Student Council, has announced that all candidates petitions,
------------------------------------------------? now available in the Dean of
Mens office, must be returned to 
that office before Thursday, De
cember 11. Regulations governing 
eligibility have been posted on 
the campus bulletin boards.
According to Mr. Shapiro there 
are a tptal of eighteen positions 
on council to be filled at this elec
tion, eleven of them being in the 
College of Engineering. Sopho
mores, juniors and seniors are 
eligible for these offices.
Three positions on Council are 
open for students of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie college, but 
only to members of the junior 
class. In the College of Fine Arts 
four positions are open to first 
semester juniors enrolled in that 
school.
Following the election, Student 
Council will be composed of thir
ty-seven voting ^members and 
four non-voting members, figures 
which are based on the present 
official enrollment total of 3617 
[ full-time day students.
Mr. Shapiro further noted that 
before the new Council can be 
officially installed, the resignation 
of two Fine Arts representatives 
who are now members of Council 
must be obtained. This action will 
be necessary in order to comply 
with the regulation which re
quires that half of the Council 
must be elected each semester.
Tentative polling places for the 
election are located one near the 
main entrance of Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie college, just out
side of the Directors office in the 
Fine Arts building, and in the 
front end of the first floor of Ad
ministration hall. To avoid con
gestion, a fourth polling place 
may be installed at another loca
tion in Industries hall.
Kiltie Calendar 
Sale Will Aid 
Band Fund
Tecvets has served its purpose, and there is no reason to con
tinue the organization any longer.
Harry Thor, speaking before the small group which responded 
to the Tec vet reorganization meeting, asked that since the old mem
bers lack interest, and the original purpose of the organization has 
been accomplished, Tecvets should be dissolved.
Jack Steiner, leader of the group wanting to revive Tecvets, 
was greatly disappointed by the*----------------------------------------------------
response to the meeting. He said 
that in view of the turnout at the 
meeting, Tecvets should be allow
ed to disintegrate. He also added 
that he would make no more at
tempts to push the organization.
Steiner feeling that there is a 
need for a veterans organization 
on campus, wanted to revive Tec
vets and restore it to its old po
sition, attracting new members
by putting an emphasis on ath
letics and social functions. He in
tended to establish a political 
organization preparatory to pre
senting a slate for the coming Stu
dent Council election.
Approximately twenty persons 
were present at the meeting, and 
of these only three were previ
ously members of the organization. 
Only four of the otjiers who at
tended submitted their names for
membership. There are almost a 
hundred names on the rolls of 
Tecvets, and all were notified of 
the meeting.
Thor said that the main purpose 
of the original organization was 
to help veterans on the campus 
as a whole, and that this was the 
basis of its constitution. He said 
that present members would rath
er see the organization dissolved 
than have an outside group take 
the reins. There would be no rea
son for its existence under the 
present constitution, and because 
of the lack of interest, it would 
be better for the organization to 
be discontinued.
Thor will give the constitution 
to Student Council during its reg
ular meeting tomorrow.
Illustrated desk calendars will 
be sold by the Kiltie Band on 
Wednesday, December 10, in Ski
bo and in the book store. The price 
of the calendars is one dollar, and, 
as the bands director, Mr. Wil
liam A. Schaeffer, points out, 
they will make excellent Christ
mas presents.
The object of the sale is to raise 
a fund to buy new uniforms and 
concert instruments. jSome of the 
bands uniforms have been in use 
since the Kilties were first organ
ized 25 years ago. The Kilties in
tend to sell these calendars each 
year before Christmas.
Measuring approximately six 
by seven inches, the calendar 
shows two weeks at a time when 
it is opened.
The front cover is handsomely 
finished and shows the Kiltie Band 
at Cleveland this year. On the back 
cover is a panoramic view of the 
campus. Throughout the calendar 
are collegiate cartoon cuts and 
fifteen photographs of the football 
team in action, the school build
ings, the Kilties at the Sugar 
Bowl, and students at work and 
at play.

Editorial
A New Kind of Spirit
Another winless football season has come 
to an end. Prospects for next year appear to be 
better, but the name of CIT will still not re
ceive extravagant praise from the local sports 
editors.
Another season of pep rallies is also gone, 
and the student body has once again demon
strated that it does not consider yelling ones 
self hoarse to  be the best use that can be 
made of a pre-game Friday evening.
And so we still dont have that good old, 
do-or-die college spirit. But if you can forget 
for a moment the liberal arte conceptions of 
school spirit, then take another look at the 
events of the past few weeks.
Carnegie Day Was Successful
The Carnegie Day ceremony of November 
25 was the best attended event of any type (in
cluding elections) held at Carnegie Tech in 
many years. Attendance totaled 1600, with 
students^ not specifically requested to be pres
ent making up well over 1000 of that total.
The exercises themselves were well planned, 
diversified, and in sympathy with the interests 
of the students. The warmth and informality 
of the presidents speech was especially well 
received by the students wrho were delighted 
to obtain first hand information about their 
school, delivered directly by its head in an 
almost personal fashion.
As a result of this drastic and favorable 
change in the nature of these ceremonies, Car
negie Day, 1948, will probably unfold before 
a completely full Music hall.
Carnegie men and women may further lack 
the spirit (and perhaps the time) to engage 
in wild, post-game escapades, but when their 
generosity was tested by Dr. Dawes energetic 
Community Fund campaign, they were the only 
student body in the city to respond with con
tributions in excess of their quota.
Agronsky ProgramWhat Students Wanted
The recent presentation of Martin Agron
sky in an assembly program completes this 
trinity of examples. The program was good 
(even if Mr. Agronsky did insist on contain
ing Russian atomic rockets with economic, 
moral, and esthetic superiority), and the Lit
tle Theater overflowed in consequence.
Thus Carnegie students are willing to sup*t big and well-planned events. But these 
ttts will not be supported indiscriminately 
CIT does now have a fair spirit, which

Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
It is a matter of general knowledge that on De
cember 2, 1947, commentator Martin Agronsky 
spoke to an overflow audience of Camegie Tech 
students. But it is not well known that Colonel 
Rutherford McClintock that very evening gave a 
talk to the Camegie Im For Me patriotic or
ganization.
He said: Gentlemen, we must 
fight such drivel as that deluded 
radiator mouthed this morning. 
Imagine saying that it is morally 
wrong to atomize the Russian 
people before they have the 
Bomb. After all, it is perfectly 
vbvious to anyone whose mind 
isnt defiled by red propaganda 
that it is either our lives or 
theirs, and I would much rather 
see the Russians atomized than 
our own people. And his state
ment that we cant defeat the Russians! Why, arent 
we descended from Old Zip Coon and
Daniel Boone, the Im For Mes intoned 
reverently, Thats the spirit. Colonel McClintocks eyes gleamed. Remember gentlemen; we 
must convince our fellow Americans that the only 
road to peace is to.
Atomize the Russians, came the answering 
chant.
Now, the McClintocks and the IFM people 
are by nature very ardent proselytisers. Two years 
did not pass before many patriotic politicians real
ized that they could express popular sentiment 
most clearly, and at the same time assure their own 
election by advocating the IFMs program. Thus by 
1949 two thousand American bombers were poised 
for an atomic thrust at Europe. It was only after 
American leaders reassured the citizenry, however, 
that the impending slaughter was entirely for the 
sake of world peace, that the telegraph key was 
pressed which gave the final command.
Two days later, in direct contradiction of the 
dim views of such pessimists as Martin Agronsky, 
Colonel McClintock announced to a wildly cheer
ing national audience that The Russian problem is 
solved.
But it wasnt as simple as that. After a few 
months had passed, business men realized that 
with our high standard of living we couldnt com
pete with nations like India and China in foreign 
trade. Yet the six percent of national income de
rived from foreign trade is the margin of profit 
necessary to keep this country a going economic 
concern. Many anxious conferences passed in Wash
ington before it was decided that the best interests

Right Face
By Robert Charpie
In the midst of great price pressure on all sides 
one of the most critical markets is new and used 
cars. The latest economic forecast issued by the 
Survey of Current Business indicates that the 
present high level demand for new cars will con
tinue at least through 1948.
The automotive industry has been running at 
full capacity for many months. The number of new 
cars coming off the assembly lines is comparable 
to the number produced in the best pre-war years. 
Still we all know just how hard it is to get a 
new car of any popular make from a dealer.
Many people have been waiting over a year for 
a new car. From month to month they have been 
told the same story. Your name is near the top 
of the list and youll get your car next month for 
sure. Lots of them still havent gotten their cars. 
Why?
The answer of course is that the inelastic market 
is too attractive an apple to go unpicked. The peo
ple want cars. In many cases they would rather 
pay a premium for a car now than wait for de
livery at the legal price.
When a dealer gets a franchise he agrees to sell 
cars at f.o.b. Detroit prices. Therefore, he dorsnt 
dare risk losing his dealership by being caught 
marking up the prices of new cars. However, noth
ing in his contract says anything about the prices 
of used car, so if he can obtain almost new used 
cars he can sell them for whatever the market 
will bear. This is the crux of the used car racket.
One widely used ruse is the intermediate pur
chaser. The dealer sells a new car to a friend. 
The friend drives the car a few miles, rarely more 
than fifty, and then sells it back to the dealer. The 
car is a new used car and its price is probably 
from $200 to $1000 over the original price.
A more recent embellishment is the trade-in 
system. If you have a 1947 model of a popular

Not Our Style
Fascinating Printers World 
Is Complete Maze of Gadgets
By A. Starke Drischell
Just pause for a moment in 
your busy day and try to imagine 
the world without the mechanic
ally printed word.
Think of any field of accom
plishment, and try to imagine how 
far it would have progressed by 
our times without books to aid in 
developing the knowledge respon
sible for that progress.
And try to think how much you 
yourself would know if you had 
never read a book, or the people 
who taught you had never read a 
book.
Such reflection prompted me, a 
layman, to inspect the printing 
department here at CIT. The 
guided tour provided for me was 
even more impressive than I had 
anticipated.
For the printing department is 
a fascinating world. Within its 
rooms are housed intricate ma
chines that make Rube Gold
berg look like an amateur, 
racks of lead type that must total 
a weight high in the tons, and 
piles of paper (printers will quake 
at this terminology) that would 
make any P & D turn shades of 
color with envy.
So complex are the elements of 
printing that the students in the 
department spend four years 
learning how to use them, and 
even then are quick to admit that 
they have gained only a ground
work upon which to specialize.
But now for some facts garnered 
from this field of printing.
The most basic process of print
ing is the letter press method. 
Let us take this process and fol
low an item through the mill of 
production. The item to be print
ed is a blotter, let us say. So 
here we go.
First it is designed. Here the 
science becomes the art. The lay
out is planned, and though I 
touch upon it lightly, it is evi
dent that this first step is of the 
utmost importance. All the 
knowledge of the designer must 
be brought to a focus. The ma
terials available to work witi: 
must be considered; the cost of 
production as compared with the 
number of pieces to be printed, 
the freedom of personal expres
sion that the designer is allowed, 
the style of type to be used, these 
and many others are the consid
erations of the designer.
The design completed, our blot
ter is to contain a picture of a 
house and several lines of writ
ing.
In order to print the picture 
chosen, it must be made into a 
plate. So the picture is prepared 
and checked, then sent to the en
graver.
Next the type is set. It may be 
assembled from individual type 
kept in racks; or run through 
the linotype which molds whole 
lines of type at a time; or the 
monotype caster which molds in
dividual pieces of type. It all de
pends upon which method the 
printer can use most practically.
The set up type is then rim 
through a hand press and an im
pression printed. This is proof
read for errors and corrections 
are made if necessary.
When the plate with the pic
ture comes back from the en
gravers it is checked to see that

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Commentator Agronsky Urges 
Acceptance of Marshall Plan
ODK Initiates 
News Analyst
Over six hundred couples heard Skitch Hendersons band 
with its Swish dance tempos at the Delta Skull sponsored Junior 
Prom in the Mens Gym last Saturday night. Nancy Reed, the 
Smoky City native was the featured vocalist. The decorations 
were excellent but were slowly annihilated as the men strove to get 
balloons for their dates from the large basket at the ceiling.
Student Council Admits Need 
For New Election By-laws
Marshall Opposes CIT Affiliation With NSA, 
Says 66We Have ISothing To Gain By Joining
By-law amendments affecting 
the Student Council election and 
a discussion of the National Stu
dent Association occupied the ma
jor part of the seventh meeting 
of the Stuaent Council at the Car
negie Union, 4:30 p. m. Decem
ber 3.
During the discussion of the 
rules governing the elections it' 
became evident that the by-laws 
needed extensive revision. Many 
loopholes were pointed out by 
Council members, both in the re
visions that are currently being 
discussed, and in other parts of 
the by-laws.
President Marshall, during the 
last section of the hour and a 
quarter meeting, presented his 
personal views of the worth of 
the National Student Association, 
placing himself on the record as 
being averse to Camegie Tech 
participation in the organization 
on the grounds that we have 
nothing to gain by joining.
Following the approval Decem
ber 18 as the date for student 
council elections, Negley Reed 
opened the discussion of the by
laws revisions by stating that it 
was his opinion that the section 
of the by-law amendment pro
posed by Mr. Seward dealing with 
the method of tallying the ballots 
was not properly included in the 
by-laws. He declared that it was 
not proper to bind any future 
elections committee to any one 
method of tallying the ballots.
After an extended discussion of 
this and many other phases of 
the by-laws governing the elec
tions, the section of the proposed 
amendment concerning the meth
od of tallying the ballots was de
leted, and Mr. Seward then gain
ed permission to table the amend
ment for another week to rewrite 
certain parts of it.
Next the lengthy discussion fo
cused on the need for a rule pre
venting a voter from giving all 
his points on a ballot to any one 
candidate. Mr. Reed proposed an 
amendment to the by-laws ful
filling the need, which was ap 
proved by council and tabled for 
one week for final approval.
Near the end of the meeting 
President Marshall asked for five 
minutes of councils time to dis
cuss the National Student Asso
ciation. He declared that the NSA 
is nothing but a student union 
.' . .to encourage student gov

Martin Agronsky, news com
mentator and recent visiting lec
turer at CIT, joined twelve mem
bers of the senior class in their 
initiation into Omicron Delta Kap
pa, held at 5:00 p. m. December 
1 in the Union.
After the initiation, the senior 
mens activities honorary adjourn
ed to the University club for a 
banquet. At the conclusion of the 
dinner, Charles Duffett, ODK 
president, introduced Mr. Agron
sky to the organization and its 
guests, and opened an evening 
of informative discussion which 
lasted for three hours.
"Mr. Agronsky ^poke of his 
early newspaper experiences, his 
switch to radio reporting, and of 
the life of a radio journalistic 
whose beat is wherever his 
home office thinks that the news 
will break next.
Although the commentators re
marks covered many serious sub
jects of national and international 
importance, such as Russian for
eign policy and the Palestine dis
turbances, he managed to include 
from his repertoire of anecdotes 
enough tales of unusual events 
with a humorous coloring to keep 
his talk thoroughly informal and 
amply supply the members of ODK 
with after-dinner jokes.
The commentators wide-rang
ing talk was followed by a discus
sion period during which his chief 
arguments concerning American 
and Russian foreign policy was 
thoroughly reviewed, and apapproved or disputed in accord
ance with the views of his audi
tors.
Sharpest disputes were produc
ed when Mr. Agronsky explained 
his views on American action
The Marshall plan in West
ern Europe must work or we 
are cooked, asserted commen
tator Martin Agronsky before 
an overflow crowd of Carnegie 
students in the Fine Arts build
ing last Tuesday, December 2.
Presented as the first of sev
eral prominent speakers to be 
brought to the campus, Mr. Ag
ronsky, Washington news an
alyst for the American Broad
casting system, attracted students 
from all of the colleges. They fill
ed the Little Theatre far above 
capacity and necessitated the use 
of a public address system for the 
crowd standing outside.
Mr. Agronskys address, The 
United States, the Congress, and 
the World, covered the problems 
of peace and the responsibilities 
of the American people and their 
Congress.
There are two hopes for 
peace, he said. They are the 
United Nations and the Marshall 
Plan. Pointing out that the Unit
ed States has so far evaded its 
responsibilities in the U.N., Mr. 
Agronsky went on to explain how 
the Marshall plan can work and 
must work to avoid an atomic 
war which no one can win.
Quoting the words of General 
Beedle Smith, recently returned 
from Moscow where he served as 
ambassador, Mr. Agronsky point
ed out that the greatest mistake 
made before World War II was 
permitting Hitler to think that 
he could conquer the world. He 
further noted that no leader, re
gardless of how vicious he might 
be, would start a war he did not 
think he could win.
We must not let Russia make 
that same miscalculation . . .
Democracy must be strong at 
home and abroad . . . strong
economically, politically, and ide
ologically. If totalitarianism pre
vails in Western Europe were

icy. He held strongly to the State 
Department policy that a contain
ment of Russian imperialism by 
means of our present economic 
superiority was the only practical 
and moral course of action.
When several of his listeners 
questioned the feasibility of such 
a course of action, one of them 
calling for an immediate preven
tive war against Russia, the com
mentator retorted sharply: You 
are my enemy and anyone with 
that point of view is my enemy, 
as he reiterated the moral inde
fensibility of such an action.
When asked to discuss the pres

marked that he thought both sides 
to be in the right and that the 
compromise of partition was the 
best that could be done with an 
impossible situation.

Pitt PiKA s Beat TXs In Intramural Contest
Confusion About Rules, Doughertys Playing 
Prove Too Strong For Fighting Theta Xi
Matmen Still 
Have Openings 
In All Classes
The touch football season for both Pitt and Carnegie Tech came 
to an end as the Pitt PiKAs beat the Carnegie TXs by a 19 to 7 
score. The game was played last Friday, December 5, in the ankle 
deep mud of the cut.
The game was similar to last years tussle in that there was 
considerable confusion about the rules that govern play at the dif
ferent schools. The decisions of the referees led to much bitter com
ment by the several hundred rab-* 
id spectators.
The game got off to a slow start 
as all players had difficulty main
taining motion on the soggy grid
iron. In the second quarter the 
TXs began to move and broke 
the deadlock when Kaelin crossed 
into paydirt for six points.
The PiKAs were quick on the 
rebound and, inspired by Dough
erty, they pushed up the field to 
s 're before the half ended. Both 
teams scored on their extra point 
tries and the Pitts picked up a 
first down to put them ahead by 
an 8-7 count at halftime.
It was an alert and inspired 
PiKA team that rushed on the field 
in the third quarter, and before 
the TXs could build up a defense 
the Pitts had scored two first 
downs, a touchdown, and an extra 
point to pull far into the front 
by a 17-7 advantage. The PiKAs 
stopped every offensive thrust the 
TXs could muster and held them 
scoreless for the rest of the game.
The Pitts later added two more 
first down to give them a 19-7 win 
and possession of the all-city tro
phy for the second straight year.
Greene and Kaelin were the 
standouts for the TX team but 
Pitts Dougherty was head and 
shoulders above the rest of the 
players on the field. His shifty 
running and accurate passing were 
too much for the Skibos. The best 
play of the game was a 50 yard 
rup down the sidelines by Greene 
nat ended when a PiKA pushed 
him into the spectators just short 
of a touchdown.
Some twenty-five men are now 
busy practicing the manly art of 
wrestling each Monday, Wednes
day, and Thursday afternoon in 
Thistle hall under the guidance of 
Coach Alexander and his assist
ant, Mr. Dee.
Most of the grunt and groan 
boys have had little or no previ
ous experience and are learning 
the fundamentals of the sport for 
the first time. They are all hard 
workers and are learning quickly. 
There is training space for more 
candidates and the coaches will 
gladly give all men who are in
terested a chance to display or 
develop their latent physical tal
ents.
Teams have not yet been form
ed and there are openings for 
hopeful muscle-tuggers in each of 
the weight classes  123 pounds, 
128 pounds, 135 pounds, 145 
pounds, 155 pounds, 165 pounds, 
175 pounds and heavyweights. 
One proposed plan would have 
each campus group which usually 
participates in intramural activi
ties enter a four-man team. This 
plan would bring out over fifty 
men.

Bowling Ends First Week, 5 Teams Unbeaten
During the past week table tennis, volleyball, and bowling fur
nished all the action in intramural sports competition but the wrest
lers and basketball players were practicing while waiting for action. 
Amid all this the intramural football season came to a roaring fin
ish when the TXs lost to the Pitt PiKAs by a 19 to 7 score.
The action in the volleyball league has progressed to a point 
where several teams dominate the play. The Kiltie league is offerT artan Cagers Prepared 
For Grove City Opener
Coach Donohoe Has Not Named Starting Five ;
Lettermen, Newcomers Fight For Positions
The Tartan cagers embark on another season by opening 
at home against Grove City college Wednesday evening, De
cember 10th. Coaches Donohoe and Cratsley have their charges 
in condition and waiting for the opening whistle.
Although the hoopsters have been practicing since Oc
tober, Coach Donohoe has not yet selected a starting lineup.
? in fact, a starting lineup would 
not mean too much since present
ing by far the best competition. 
The Emanons are undefeated 
with a record of four wins, the 
ATOs are close behind with five 
wins and only one defeat. This 
defeat, however, came from the 
Emanons who defeated them de
cisively in two straight games to 
take the match. It is impossible 
for any other team to cap the 
title but the Emanons must win 
the next two if they are to pre
vent a tie.
In the Scot League the TXs 
continue in quest of the all points 
trophy with four straight wins 
and no defeats. Their team is well 
organized and should be favorites 
to take this section of the league.
The red hot SAEs moved closer 
to the Tartan, league title with 
five straight wins. Theirs is by 
far the best team in the league 
and seems to have the title sewed 
up.
The table tennis league com
petition has not been very active 
because most of the teams have 
been unable to agree on dates for 
matches. Mr. See wants all teams 
to get the games played off so that 
a winner can be determined. At 
present the Unknowns led the 
Skibo league with tjiree wins, 
while the TXs top the Plaid 
league with two wins. Neither 
team has been beaten so far this 
season.

Intramural bowling got off to a 
fast start last Saturday as the two 
leagues, the Strikes and the 
Spares played four matches each.
Ratings this year will be based 
on the number of games won and 
not the number of matches won, 
as has been the case in the past. 
This is a more representative way 
of computing winners and should 
prove to be successful
In the Spare league, the SplitEmanon group finished with the 
highest single game score and 
highest game average for the day 
when they defeated Sigma Nu No. 
2 with scores of 791, 870 and 859. 
Fred Prices 168, 211, and 207 
gave him individual honors for 
the day and contributed consider
ably to his teams total.
In the other games in the Spare 
League, the Delts No. 1 team took 
three straight from the ASCEs; 
the TXs took three from the Beta 
Sigs, and the SAEs took two out 
of three from the Tau Delts.
In the Strike league the Betas 
and the DUs took three games 
apiece from the Kappa Sigs and 
Phi Kaps, respectively. Weinreighs 213 for the Betas was the 
high individual game for the day.
The other two games in this 
league found the ATOs taking 
two out of three from the Delts 
No. 2 and Citcom taking two out 
of three from the Sigma Nu No. 1.
Futility Bowl 
Bids For CIT
plans call for the use of about 
eight men who will be rotated 
to determine the best combination.
In the late practice sessions the 
men used most often on the first 
five have been: Theodore, Katselas, Riehl, Chetlin, Matsey, El
lies, Beanchi, and McCullough. 
The first five mentioned are let
termen holdovers from last years 
squad, while the remaining three 
are newcomers.
The rest of the squad is made 
up of men with some previous ex
perience either at Carnegie or in 
high schools. Fastuca, Mruk, 
Heiles and Dunn were all members 
of previous wartime Tartan 
squads. The other two members 
of the 14 man squad are Yarian 
and Johe. Two freshmen, Hammann and Koos, have been work
ing out with the varsity but will 
probably start the season with the 
freshman team where they can 
play more regularly.
During the past week Coach 
Donohoe has been placing em
phasis on speedy ball handling 
and setting up fast breaking plays 
against both zone and man-forman defenses. Riehl and Chetlin 
have been used as feeders while 
Mike Theodore works at the pivot. 
Katselas and Matsey have been 
hitting the hoop well from the 
comers while Ellie has been a 
deadeye under the basket.
The opening encounter with 
Grove City should give the Plaid 
their best opportunity for a win 
this season. The Grovers have 
practically the same team as the 
one which the Tartans trounced 
last year by a 72-47 count. This 
[Continued on page 11]
The rush of bowl bids finally 
found Carnegie Tech last week as 
the Tartans were picked as one of 
the teams to play a post-season 
game in the Futility Bowl. Ac
cording to a dispatch carried by 
the Uhited Press, the other partic
ipating team will be Kansas State 
University.
Kansas State qualified for the 
invitation by losing 26 straight 
games and rolling up 71 points to 
their opponents 263 points in los
ing nine straight games this year.
Carnegie became eligible as they 
amassed a total of 47 points, hold
ing their opponents to 141 in los
ing six games during this season. 
They also had the additional hon
or of not having won in 18 straight 
games, the streak lasting over a 
period since 1942.
If both teams accept the invita
tion, it is expected to be a battle 
royal to see who can keep their 
streaks intact. However, here in 
Pittsburgh it is expected that the 
Executive Board of Carnegie Tech 
will disapprove the invitation on 
the grounds that it is not in keep
ing with the high standards con
nected with the schools name.
The only trouble is that the Fu
tility Bowl is mythical!
CIT Swimmers 
Begin Tune-Up 
For First Meet
Opening their second month of 
practice, the Carnegie Tech swim
mers have begun a final tune-up 
for their first meet with Slippery 
Rock State Teachers College on 
December 17 With Coach Sofield 
being busy determining the start
ing lineup for the meet on the 
basis of time trials and intra
squad duels.
The teams freestyle strength 
has been considerably increased 
by dash man Bob Sapper. He is 
undefeated in the 50 and 100 yard 
freestyle time trials. The back
stroke outlook is also good with 
Paul Schroeder and Robin Molny 
being counted on for one-two in 
almost all of the meets.
The return of the Tartans three 
ace breaststrokers, Dave Luckey, 
Bill Ferguson, and BiU Zoller, as
sures the Skibo mermen of points 
in this event also.
Captain Luckey will also swim 
the 300 yard medley relay as the 
team attempts to eclipse its best 
record of 3:19.7. The winning of 
meets depends heavily on the 
teams strength in this event. 
Probably swimming the 440 yard 
freestyle are Ames Penfield, John 
Dowd, and Lee Vogle.
The Tartan swimmers will be 
fighting the odds in their attempt 
to avenge last years loss to Slip
pery Rock, but if this seasons 
squad lives up to the traditions 
set by Carnegies teams of previ
ous years, the meet will be a bat
tle all the way.

Opening Game With Grove City 
Should Provide Win For CIT
Joe Pash Memorial Grid Trophy 
Awarded to Center C. B. Groom*
Now that the moleskins and 
cleats have been tucked away and 
Carnegie has received a bowl bid, 
we can officially consider the foot
ball season at an end. Right on 
its heels comes 
the basketball P ' ^
season, which j 
opens tomorrow 
night in the SkiHI; 
bo gym where a
the Tartan hoopsters play host^'TF; Wl|
to Grove City, ""nr*
This is then an iNfl! 
opportune time pf 
to look over theJ \
Last season, Bill 
Donohoes first Pete Cregut 
year at the helm, could hardly be 
called a screaming success, as the 
Tartans won only three games 
while losing sixteen. But while 
the record tells most of the story, 
it does not tell it all. The brand 
of basketball played during the 
first half of the season did not 
compare with that played during 
the second half. And the reason 
for the difference was in the ad
dition of two players to the squad, 
Leo Clougherty and Mike Theo
dore.
Leo and Mike proved to be just 
the sparkplugs who were needed 
to pull the team out of its losing 
complex. Unfortunately Leo found 
it more opportune to transfer to 
Duquesne at the beginning of this 
semester and hence will not be 
back. But Mike will be and should 
develop into the big offensive gun 
on this years team. In recogni 
tion of his abilities Coach Donohoe has appointed Mike the cap
tain of the team, a choice which 
should be quite popular.
Another advantage wnich this 
seasons squad will have is a 
longer pre-season practice period
There was no assistant coach last 
year to do the job Mel Cratsley 
has done this year and official 
practice did not start until the 
end of the football season. Most 
of the team managed to get out 
to run around the floor occasion 
ally, but it neednt be pointed out 
that this kind of practice cant 
take the place of organized ses 
sions. This year the team has 
been practicing since October as 
unit and the difference should 
be evident during the early part 
of the season.
Another factor in Carnegies 
losing season last year was the 
caliber of competition. It is not as 
easy to reduce a basketball sched
ule to the same class B caliber of 
the football schedule. And yet the 
same reasoning as Doctor Doherty 
has applied to football holds for 
basketball. With the exception of 
two or three teams, any of the 
squads on this years schedule 
might turn up with a team cap 
able of playing in Madison Square 
Garden. As an example of this 
consider the dropping of West 
Virginia from the schedule this 
year because they were continu
ally out of Carnegies class. So 
Lawrence Tech was added to the 
schedule and they have turned up 
with one of the best teams in the 
midwest. They have yet to lose 
this season and ran up a score of 
114 to 46 against Percy Jones last 
week. This same thing might be 
true of Pitt, W&J or Westminster 
at any time. We firmly believe 
that the Tartans have neither the 
coaching nor the material to play 
such potential powerhouses. But 
we must also admit that there is 
no immediately apparent solution.
We see a definite improvement 
in this years squad for three rea
sons. First, because the men who [Continued on page 10]
As a final note to end CITs football season, C. B. Groomes was 
presented the Joe Pash Memorial trophy during the intermission of 
last Saturdays Junior Prom.
In presenting the trophy, Tom Popielski, president of Phi Kappa 
fraternity said, Last year, we of the Phi Kappa fraternity made 
the initial presentation of the Joe Pash Memorial trophy as a me
morial to Joe Pash, a former gridiron star. While here at Carnegie 
Joe had the reputation of being ?-
one of the most courageous play
ers on the team. Everyone who 
saw Joe play was impressed by 
the fight the little guy showed 
while on the gridiron.
After leaving CIT Joe entered 
the Navy and was later reported 
missing in action. Joe typified the 
spirit that we all like to see when
ever the Tartans take the field. 
No matter how badly they have 
been beaten, we want them to be 
in there fighting.
This years selection by the 
coaches and the players, Popiel
ski continued, "is an outstanding 
lineman. He gained the respect of 
his opponents and his teammates 
by his formidable playing. I would 
like, at this time, on behalf of the 
Phi Kappa fraternity, to present 
this trophy to a great center and 
a great guy  C. B. Groomes. 
The applause that greeted this 
announcement attested to the ap
proval of the student body of the 
choice of C. B. as the most val
uable player on the 1947 squad.
C. B. as he is known to his 
hosts of friends, began his foot
ball career as a fullback on the 
Springdale, Pa. high school 
He then left Springdale for Kiski 
Prep where he was converted to 
center, the position he now

he played center on the varsity 
as a freshman. He was then called 
into the Army from which he was

to CIT where he soon assumed 
the duties of center on the foot
ball squad in 1946.
This year, C. B. has been espe
cially outstanding in his defensive 
work as a line backer. There were 
few tackles made anywhere on

echnical Rehearsal Marks 
Umax of Pre-production Work
Upon entering the Little The
atre last Thursday night for the 
technical rehearsal of the current 
drama production, The Wingless 
Victory, one would have found 
the theatre alive with all kinds of 
dramat technicians busily engag
ed in preparations for the re
hearsal.
The technical rehearsal is an 
>ortant preliminary step taken 
fhe production of a play. Its 
purpose is to assimilate the many 
activities of light, property, cos
tume, and stage crews in order to 
make the dramatization as pic
turesque and artistic as possible.
Members of the freshmen crew 
. ho didnt have any particular 
job to do were lounging around 
taking things easy while Bob 
Clark, stage work instructor com
monly referred to as the whip, 
eyed them suspiciously.
Dave Clark, property crew 
chief,, was yelling orders to Emy 
Firontino and Bill Heller who 
were dragging out nineteenth 
century chairs and couches and 
acing them in position on stage. 
Back stage in the light gallery, 
Lucy Appleton was busily throw
ing switches in an effort to get 
exactly the right kind of light in 
exactly the right places.
Upstairs in the make-up room, 
Felice Orlandi struck a comic 
pose as Judge Urquardt, with 
something added in the way of 
nose design.
In the green room, director 
Mary Morris was consulting ac
tors on last minute correction in 
stage business, as Roger Braun, 
personifying the villainous char
acter of Rev. Phineas, posed be
fore the mirror.
Later on when the actors came 
out on the stage to have costumes 
and make-up checked under the 
lights. There was a glimpse of 
Nancy Wickwire in the exotic cos
tume of princess Oparre, and Jim 
Harkey, a handsome sight in the 
colorful garb of Captain Na
thaniel.

vantage of the feudal economy of 
the Arabs to foster either com
munism or democracy.
In discussing the attitude of the 
American people and their Con
gress, Mr. Agronsky questioned 
the wisdom in appropriating 70 
billion dollars in one year for 
war and then refusing to spend 
the one billion a year for peace, 
which the Marshall plan requires 
to ensure the peace.
Mr. Agronsky told the engi
neers and scientists of Carnegie 
that one of the most encouraging 
things he had seen in Washington 
was the acute awareness of their 
world responsibilities on the part 
of the young physicists who made 
the atomic bomb and later ap
peared before the Congressional 
committee on atomic energy.
These men, in spite of their 
youth, greatly impressed the elder 
senators and were largely respon
sible for the removal of atomic 
power from military control and 
placing it in the hands of a ci
vilian commission.

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Post Art Exhibit Displayed 
This Week In Hewlett Museum
The Saturday Evening Post Art 
exhibition will be shown in the 
Hewlett museum, Fine Arts build
ing, Monday through Friday, from 
9:00 a. m. to 10:00 p. m. and Sat
urdays from 9:00 a. m. to 12:00 
noon. The show is scheduled to 
run from December 2 through De
cember 19.
The exhibition is a collection of 
28 outstanding examples of the 
art of illustration that have ap
peared at one time or another in 
the Saturday Evening Post. In
cluded among the men whose 
work will be shown are Floyd M. 
Davis, Stevan Dohanos,. Robert 
Fawcett, A1 Parker, and Norman 
Rockwell.
This is not an exhibition of great 
paintings, but rather an exhibition 
of great illustrations. Quoting from 
Kenneth Stuart, critic of paint
ing, A great painting is one in 
which a skilled painter has suc
ceeded in combining line, form, 
color, and so on, into an har
monious and balanced whole. A 
great illustration is ... a good 
painting . . . employed to serve 
the ends of emphasis, and the 
emphasis is upon a story idea.
This exhibition was assembled 
in response to recent requests from 
universities, art schools, art 
groups and art institutes. In a
recent exhibit of magazine illus 
trations at Radio City, a conimittee of artists selected 117 pic
tures for the show as being tiie 
best in the field. Almost half Qf 
the 117 appeared originally in the 
Saturday Evening Post.
CIT Exceeds 
Chest Quota
Carnegie Tech has achieved the 
honor of being the only school in 
the county to reach and exceed 
its Community Chest quota. When 
all the returns were in on the 
closing day, November 13, tabu
lations showed that the students 
and paid staff had over-subscrib
ed the quota of $6500 by about 
$100.
Dr. Norman H. Dawes said, I 
think the students of Carnegie 
Tech may be very proud of hav
ing met and exceeded their quota. 
This is particularly commendable 
since there are so many veterans 
in school. I wish to congratulate 
the students for their support. It 
shows that they are taking their 
civic responsibilities seriously.

treatment for such injuries as dis
located shoulders and fractures.
The Intramural Board levied a 
small assessment against each 
player participating in this years 
games as a means of building up 
a fund which would defray med
ical expenses to the extent of 
$15 per man. The board is with
holding distribution of these 
funds, however, in the hope that 
the school will pay for charges 
incurred as a result of intramural 
injuries.
Dr. Doherty commented that the 
Intramural Boards proposal seem
ed to be a just one, and that he 
would investigate further.
General discussion of social re
lation courses, perennial topic for 
the committee, filled the final por
tion of the meeting.
The problem presented was that 
of the need for more public speak
ing practice and instruction for 
engineers. And Dr. Doherty was 
amazed to find that instructors 
in social relations courses spoke 
so much.
He emphasized that every time 
a student recites, he is making a 
public speech, and that if he tries 
to do well, He will eventually 
get it.

Printing Is
linued from page 2] 
lg^-ver has made no misand now our blotter be
gins to take shape. The plate 
is carefully locked with the type 
in a metal frame to align it 
with the printed matter.
Now we are ready for the step 
in procedure which most laymen 
think of first in connection with 
printing: the actual press work, 
ut it would be impossible to go 
> a discussion of the operation 
he press in an article of this 
*ort. There are all sizes, shapes, 
and makes of letter presses, and 
one has only to look at a press in 
operation to realize how compli
cated and exacting is this phase 
'f production.
The utmost care is required in 
watching the presses at work to 
see that no snarls develop, the 
inking is even, the paper is feed
ing straight, and so on, and so on. 
One press, the Miehle Vertical 
press, intrigued me when I saw it 
in operation because of a small 
device that was attached to it.
It was a gadget so regulated 
that it blew a fine cloud of corn 
starch under each sheet of paper 
before it dropped onto the pile 
after being printed. The purpose 
of the corn starch was to separ
ate the printed sheets just enough 
so that wet ink from one sheet 
did not touch and spot the next. 
This minor point indicates how 
technieallly perfected the science 
has become.
When the printing step is fin
ished, our objective has been ac
complished. But we have made 
only the simplest of blotters. We 
did not use a combination of col
ors which would have required a 
separate setup for each part to 
be colored and as many runs 
through the press.
And we printed only one blot
ter at a time when we might have 
made a row of identical setups and 
printed perhaps eight blotters in 
a string. And had our item to be 
printed been a several page book
let we would have had to send 
the work through folding ma
Professional 
Attitude Must 
Be Adopted
We must have a professional 
attitude toward professional 
work, said Director B. Kenneth 
Johnstone of the College of Fine 
Arts on November 18 in an ad
dress to the Fine Arts students.
He further stated that 50% of 
what college students learn to
day will be discarded in the fu
ture because of the constant pro
gress which is being made in the 
professions. Twenty years from 
now there will be new techniques 
in acting, architecture, and all 
other professional fields.
Dr. Johnstone believes that the 
responsibility of the student is to 
make continuous progress in his 
professional work. Significance 
does not lit in the end resulta 
new building or a perfected act
ing techniquebut in the progress 
the student has made.
The four years a student spends 
in college are years of guid
ance. He is taught to think pro
gressively, to establish beneficial 
habits, and to develop a profes
sional attitude. After such train
ing the student should be capable 
of self-criticism and should have 
an objective point of view, Dr. 
Johnstone stated.
Professional people, according 
to Dr. Johnstone, are experts in 
the fields of music, art, medicine, 
or science. Their training does not 
cease with formal education; they 
must climb steadily upward to 
success. Their minds must be open 
to fresh and new ideas and they 
must understand the contempor
ary views of youth.
He said that those who refuse 
to advance, and who are resistant 
to new ideas will find success im
possible, but people who believe 
they are neither too old nor too 
intelligent to progress are assur
ed success.
The keynote, therefore, of Di
rector Johnstones address was 
that making constant progress in 
ones chosen professional work is 
essential.
Committee Has 
Carnival Plans
Sororities Drop Roller 
Derby For Vaudeville
The Spring Carnival committee 
has made a few tentative plans 
for the carnival next May 14 and 
15. A few changes have been sug
gested.
Instead of participating in a roll
er derby, the sororities are to put 
on a vaudeville showeach to give 
an act of fifteen to twenty min
utes. It is hoped that the show 
will be held on Flagstaff hill, but 
in case of rain it will be held in 
the Little Theater.
Before the holidays there is to 
be an all-school vote on which 
orchestras will be asked to play 
and on whether or not to replace 
the Friday night informal dance 
with a masquerade ball. The Sat
urday night dance will continue to 
be formal.
Math Club Will 
Hold Meeting 
On December 11
The recently inaugurated Car
negie chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, 
national mathematics honorary, 
will hold its first open meeting on 
Thursday, December 11, at 4:30 
in IH 104. Harry Weiss, a teach
ing assistant in mathematics, will 
speak on Finite Differences and 
Statistics. Everyone interested is 
cordially invited to attend.
The chapter is at present mak
ing plans for the coming semester. 
It expects to induct new members 
in March, to hold a banquet 
shortly before graduation, and to 
make a suitable presentation to 
those members of the chapter who 
are graduating in June. In addi
tion it hopes to bring in an out
side speaker to address the group 
meeting sometime during the se
mester.
ever before!
A Maze of Gadgets
chines and then through binding 
machines.
Yes, its complicated work. And 
let me mention at this point one 
impression I received during my 
tour which must not be overlook
ed. It strikes me that there is one 
supreme prerequisite to being a 
good printer.
He must, of course, be skilled 
in his work. That goes without 
saying. But if any printer is to 
pursue his profession and enjoy 
a measure of success he must have 
volumes and then some of that 
ancient virtue, patience.
The machines that the printer 
uses are temperamental fellows. 
They have a habit of stopping, 
snarling, breaking down at the 
most aggravating moments. And 
when that happens, as it is bound 
to do many times during the 
course of a printers career, he 
must be able to pause, take a deep 
breath, and start on the some
times long and arduous business 
of tracing the source of the trou
ble.
In closing let me mention three
final facts about the printing de
partment that are unique.
The first of these is that the 
printing department maintains a 
most extensive contact with its 
alumni. Every graduate of the 
printing department is kept up 
to date with everything that the 
Department can find out about the 
profession.
New advances in the field, news 
about openings in the profession 
that might be helpful to a grad
uate in bettering his position, 
news about what every man is 
doing, anything and everything, 
the department tells the men who 
have gone on from CIT. A stag
gering correspondence is kept up 
at all times.
Secondly, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology is the only college 
in the United States that gives a 
bachelor of science degree in 
printing.
And thirdly, according to my 
count from the bulletin of the de
partment, there are 953 individ
ual items of equipment in the de
partment of printing.

and a magician will be on hand 
to display his skill.
Physicists may obtain their 
tickets from Walter J. Smith, 
Arnold Slifkin, Wallace Parr, and 
several other physicists.
The Proteus Clan is also con 
templating a field trip to the long

of world civilization  which is 
98% American anywaywould be 
served by atomizing nations which 
can sell cheaper in the foreign 
market than we can.
Two thousand bombers again 
took to the air and within a few 
days Colonel McClintock was able 
to announce that The American 
people have outdistanced all com
petitors in the foreign market.
Nevertheless, it seemed that no 
sooner was one problem solved 
than another arose. It became a 
matter of general concern that 
what with the new atomic moral
ity, every other nation was de
veloping atomic weapons to de
stroy us. This fear plagued the 
national conscience so desperate
ly that, after another thunderous 
campaign by McClintock and the 
IFMs, the command was given 
to the atomic squadron to atom
ize all foreign nations. This was 
done posthaste, and the enthusisatic cheering of the Im For 
Mes drowned out the misgiv
ings of some old fogey philoso
phers.
Now yet another and deeper 
fear swept the country. Rumors 
circulated that the OCSPOnly 
Chocolate Soda Partywhich con
sidered anyone who had ever tast
ed vanilla a theat to world peace, 
was preparing to annihilate all
opposition. Some American sci
entists sided with them, some 
with the opposing vanilla group, 
and the nation was divided into 
two atomic arsenals. After the 
horrifying civil war that followed 
only two people remained alive 
in the entire World: a young man 
of the Chocolate party and a 
young woman of the Vanilla 
party.
These two public-spirited citi
zens decided that things had gone 
far enough. They would unite their 
efforts to rebuild a new world, 
this event to be formally celebrat
ed by a peace party with both 
chocolate and vanilla sodas for re
freshment.
But deep-seated animosities are 
indeed hard to eradicate. The 
young man put arsenic in the va
nilla sodas, and the young woman 
put fluoride in the chocolates.
And after that party the world 
was indeed at peace.

Professor Smith, one of the pion
eers in this new concepts of pro
fessional education, stated, you 
cant isolate a professional man 
and restrict him to his own pro
fession. We want to make him 
more of a man, much less of a 
technician.
Believing that colleges are at 
the crossroads, the Provost point
ed out that the new idea in edu
cation is to get away from cram
ming and to teach the students the 
fundamentals which will make it 
possible for him to keep learning 
for the rest of his life.
The old style of education, 
Professor Smith continued, was 
exploded by the war, which 
knocked some of the old methods 
to pieces. The war also added so 
much knowledge that the student 
cannot now be expected to learn 
all that he needs to know. He must 
pick up the knowledge as he goes 
along.
CIT, by pioneering in this new 
idea of education, has gained in
ternational reknown. President 
Doherty spread this fame further 
last spring when he explained the 
new methods to English educa
tors.

Thats what you can earn after completing 
one year of pilot training and winning your wings 
in the Air Force.
It is a good deal from the start. While you're 
an Aviation Cadet you draw $75 per month, plus 
food, quarters, uniforms, medical and dental 
care. After successfully finishing the course, you 
are commissioned a Second Lieutenant, Air Force 
Reserve, and assigned to active duty with the 
Air Force at $336 a month (including flight pay), 
with excellent chances for further increases as 
promotions come through.
In addition, you get an extra $500 for each 
year of active duty, and will be given a chance to 
compete for a commission in the Regular Air 
Force if you are interested in a service career.
This opportunity, which cannot he duplicated 
anywhere else at any price, equips men for wellpaid, responsible positions throughout the avia
tion industry, at high pay from the beginning. It
is open to you if youre single, between 20 and 
26^/2 years old, and have completed at least onehalf the requirements for a degree from an 
accredited college or university (or pass an exami
nation measuring the equivalent). Ask for 
details at your U. S. Army and U. S. Air Force 
Recruiting Station, or write to Headquarters,

Though it might appear that he is 
spreading himself too thinly over 
Student Council, Tau Beta Pi, 
ODK, welfare chairmanship of 
Citcom Clan, presidency of the 
Chemistry club, .and the other 
parts of his pattern of activities, 
Gus is known for somehow at
taining his objectives.
A quick review of the situation, 
then a headlong plunge consti
tute the Gustavsonian approach 
to new jobs and new problems. 
Success as an executive and as an 
organizer follows rather from this 
enthusiasm, and the clearness of 
his perception than from any in
spirational qualities.
But this perceptive power could 
hardly be deduced from his out
ward appearance. His amoebic 
peregrinations between classroom 
and Skibo table, and his loung
ing detachment during those 8:30 
social relation sessions give him 
an appearance of composure not 
normally assigned to one with his 
responsibilities.
There is, in fact, just one de
fect in this seemingly perfect 
anomaly. Gus is a confirmed 
moaner.
A special Christmas chapel will 
be held in the foyer of the Fine 
Arts building at 11:30 a.m. on 
Tuesday, Dec. 16th. This is a cus
tomary program of Christmas 
greetings to the student body 
from the school.
The program has been set up 
as follows:
Reading of the Christmas Story 
from the Scriptures, Henry F. 
Boettcher, Head of Drama 
Dept.
Prayer, Prof. H. K. KirkPatrick, 
Christmas Greetings, B. Kenneth 
Johnstone, director of the 
College of Fine Arts.
A music department choir will 
lead the students in the singing 
of carols and will give a special 
selection. Decorations, including 
the brightly trimmed tree, will 
be provided to add to the beauty 
of this program.

CIT Libraries Provide 
Reference Matter
Every Building On Campus Except Skibo9 Gym 
Has Libraries For Evening Students To Use
If anyone in the evening school needs reference material, he 
would do well to visit the various libraries found here on the cam
pus, for no building (except the Gymnasium and Skibo) is without 
one. Each library has a wide range of material relative to the classes 
which are taught in its particular building.
The main library is in IH 240 and is well stocked with author
ized dictionaries, the better periodicals, and works concerning phil
osophy, education and literature.*
It is open Monday through Friday 
from 9:00 a. m. to 9:00 p. m., on 
Saturday from 9:00 a. m. to 1:00 
p. m. Also in Industries hall, hav
ing the same hours but in room 
327-R, is the social relations li
brary, replete with volumes con
cerning history, economics, re
ligion and some on philosophy.
For a varied choice of scientific 
reference material, the science li
brary, EH 115, is well supplied.
Books on physics and chemistry 
comprise the bulk of material to 
be found here, but information on 
mathematics, engineering, bio
chemistry, geology, mineralogy, 
and metallurgy can be found here.
Many bound volumes of scientific 
journals dating quite a few years 
back are part of the science li
brary. It, too, is available Mon
day through Friday from 9:00 a. 
m. to 9:00 p. m., and on Satur
days from 9:00 a. m. to 1:00 p. m.
The engineering library, lo
cated in MH 100, specializes in 
reading matter dealing with elec
trical, mechanical and aeronau
tical engineering. All phases of 
electrical theory, motors, heatpower generation, machine de
sign, radar, radio and shop prac
tice are covered. The hours are 
from 9:00 a. m. to 12:00 noon, 
from 1:30 p. m. to 5:00 p. m., from 
6:00 p. m. to 9:00 p. m., and on 
Saturday from 9:00 a. m. to 12:00 
noon.
Fine arts library, in FA 110, is 
made up of material concerning 
architecture, sculpture, painting 
and designing, music, drama, in
terior design, and industrial de
sign. On Monday through Fri
day, from 9:00 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. 
and from 6:00 p. m. to 9:00 P. M.;

One of the best known and most 
genial evening students on campus 
is Chester Biscup, who has assist
ed in evening student organiza
tions for the past seventeen years. 
No matter where you see him, he 
always greets you with a ready 
smile, and if you have some prob
lem on your mind, he has the time 
to pause and offer a helping hand.
Originally, he enrolled in elec
trical equipment and construction 
in 1929. After that department 
was discontinued he transferred 
to electrical engineering which 
cause he hopes to complete in the 
coming year.
Ches has been married about 
seven years. He has one child 
who will carry on the Biscup 
name and probably will enroll in 
CIT about 1960.
In 1930 Ches was selected for 
membership in Student Council 
as a representative from electrical 
engineering. In 1945 he was 
elected president, a post which he 
held for two years. He now holds 
the office of advisor to Student 
Council where his wise counsel 
provides a sound background for 
decisions of this group.

Here we are back again, folks, 
and of course with the latest news 
here goes
An interesting occurrence goes 
on practically every night on the 
roof of Industries hall directly 
outside of Room 209. Everyone 
welcome!
Elvira Maiorana, a student in 
Mr. Ellis sculpturing class and 
whose hobby is ceramics will 
have some of her work on display 
in the Hobby Window of the Far
mers Bank Building. Quite in
teresting, I hear.
More about Industries hall. We 
hear a chicken-hawk crashed 
through a window on the first 
floor and narrowly missed our 
Drama editor; then someone 
picked it up and sent it on its way 
not knowing there is a $4 bounty 
on chickenhawks.
Say, fellas, have you seen that 
cute little gal in painting class on 
Mondays and Thursdays? Just 
walk up to the fourth floor of the 
Fine Arts buildingif you can 
make it.
Our fair lassie by name of Ma
rian Vaughan would like to stir 
up a little interest about our 
Thanksgiving dance. Seems that 
she has some tickets for sale.
Results from last weeks call for 
lost and found articles was very 
favorable. Hooper located his 
slide rule on the ledge of the 
backseat of his car.
Karl Matthes learned a little 
chemistry the hard way last Wed
nesday evening. Water and gaso
line just will not support com
bustion in a 41 Buick motor.
R. Rowland had a little difficul
ty in obtaining an order in a res
taurant the other day. He asked 
the waitress for peaches and 
cream, and on being the recipient 
a half-hour later of a dish with 
cream in it, and peaches placed 
in the center like an island, he be
came irritated. He told the wait
ress, he had asked for peaches 
and cream, not peaches with 
cream.  To the sarcastic remark, 
Well, whats the diff?, he re
plied, You figure out the differ
ence between a woman and a 
child and a woman with a child. 
Paul Brannen shouldnt ask 
questions that get him into trouble 
or else he should keep quiet be
cause of the answers he gets. One 
day he asked a bartender, Do you 
serve women? He gave a good 
answer, No, you bring your own. 
Everyone seems excited about 
the coming Thanksgiving dance, 
wondering which dress to wear 
or which boyfriend to take. (Its 
quite a decision.) Take your best 
boyfriend, girls and have a good 
time! BUT BE THERE!!

The students enrolled in the Evening Classes this semester can

The short-range commuters who represent about 20% of the stu

Student Ideas
Editor of the Plaid:
Complying with your request 
for student opinion, I herefore 
submit this letter.
I have no objections with the 
student council; I think they are 
doing a commendable job. But in 
contrast, I think that the student 
council should support more and 
varied activities, create more stu
dent interest and expand public
ity.
May I suggest that we have a 
student assembly on some con
venient date to acquaint the stu
dent body with the activities of 
the school and outline a program 
that would prove to our mutual 
agreement.

plaining about the lack of parking 
space near Industries Hall.
Middle-range commuters are 
members of the largest group in 
Evening School. They come from 
every point outside Pittsburgh but 
in Allegheny County. About onethird of these come from the com
munities of Brentwood, Etna, Mc
Keesport, Mt. Lebanon, Swissvale and Wilkinsburg. The latter 
lead the list, being second only to 
Pittsburgh in the number of stu
dents. The above list is by no 
means complete. Almost any 
small town, township or borough 
you can mention has some repre
sentation in Evening School. In 
fact, there are 95 communities, ex
clusive of Pittsburgh, that furnish 
students to Tech.
The long-range commuters come 
from far and wide. Uveir points 
of origin may be found in Arm
strong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, 
Lawrence, Washington and West
moreland counties in Pennsylva
nia; Jefferson County in Ohio; 
and Hancock and Ohio counties in 
West Virginia. Although this 
group, which consists of about 
10% of our students, is the small
est of the three listed, it is to be 
congratulated. It includes men 
and women who commute from 
places such as Butler, Ell wood 
City, Greeinsburg, Latrobe, Mt. 
Pleasant and Uniontown, Pennsyl
vania; Steubenville, Ohio; Holli
days Cove and Wheeling, West 
Virginia.
The three groups listed com
plete the enrollment in the Even
ing School. Whether the student 
comes from far or near, he de
serves credit for being ambitious 
and hard-working, for if he was 
not, he would not be among us.

Executive Board is necessary for 
this purpose. Such an action will 
be recommended if the attendance 
at tomorrows dance is large 
enough to indicate a student in

Bill Poirier and Robert Owens, 
who are managing the affair for 
APO.
This is the beginning of a new 
series of service projects by the 
Kappa chapter of Alpha Phi 
Omega to promote school spirit 
and general morale, Owens stat

was the dissolution of the Fine
