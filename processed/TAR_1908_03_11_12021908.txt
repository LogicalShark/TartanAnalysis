VOL III, No. 11 PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1908 TEN CENTS
THE W. & J. GAME
The last game came and passed into history last 
Thursday. We were defeated, but the stand made 
by the team the first half did lots to re-instate them 
for the poor showing that has been made lately with 
so many cripples on the list. The 5 to 0 score at 
the end of the first half was certainly cause for selfcongratulation and didnt give promise of what was 
to come later.
The last half saw a great deal of substitution and 
the defense gradually weakened as the game pro
ceeded. Straight foot-ball was the rule almost en
tirely throughout the game and W. & J. didnt try 
any new formation on us. We only made first down 
once in' each half, but W. & J. was forced to do a 
great deal of punting the first half. In fact, after 
the first score made there was almost a punting due, 
and Pinky certainly held up his end.
Frampton opened the game by kicking off to W. 
Marshall, left halfback, who came back for 30 yards. 
The visitors tore off 15 yards in two downs, but were 
penalized 15 yards for holding the line. Duffys punt 
was fumbled by Roura and Wimberly recovered the 
ball on the Tech 20-yard mark. i In four plunges 
Wimberly shot across for the visitors first touch
down. It proved the only score of the half. Tibbens heeled the puntout, but Duffy missed goal.
W. & J. was forced to punt immediately after the 
next kickoff, and the rooters went wild as Frampton 
tore through for four and Roura for five yards. The 
visitors took the ball on downs, with only six inches 
to spare. Hittner's 9-yard run on a fake kick netted 
us our longest gain for scrimmage. Roura and Hittner staved off the W. & J. scoring by cleverly break
ing up forward passes.
Duffy, the W. & J. kicker, attempted a field goal 
from the Tech 30-yard mark but failed. We had to
put in a new pair of ends, Patterson and McCorkle, 
for Critchlow and Beeken, before the half was over.
The Tech eleven trotted out for the second half 
and immediately made second firstdown of the game. 
Dowling making plunges of eight and one yards, and 
Roura adding the remaining distance. An exchange 
of punts followed.
W. & J.s first score of the half followed the re
covery of a punt fumbled by Tech on its 25-yard 
mark, by Sutter, the Red and Black quarterback. 
Measurements were required to determine whether 
the visitors had made their distance, as they ad
vanced to the 5-yard mark by short plunges by Wim
berly and W. Marshall and Sutters short run. Three 
attempts were necessary for W. Marshall to carry 
the ball over the last four yards. Duffy kicked the 
goal. W. & J., 11; Tech, 0.
The visitors began tearing the tiring Tech team 
to pieces. Patterson, of Tech, at one stage got away 
for 20 yards on a forward pass from Dowling, but 
officials called the ball back. Tech fumbled a punt 
on its 20-yard mark, but recovered. A forward pass 
went wild, and the 15-yard penalty put the ball with
in Tech's five-yard mark. Framptons punt from be
hind the line was blocked and he fell on the ball for 
a safety. Score, W. & J., 13; Tech, 0.
Within a minute after the kickoff, Wimberly cap
tured Techs onside kick on its 30-yard mark. An
derson tore off 13 yards in two tries. Wimberly put 
the ball on the seven-yard mark. Two plunges were 
stopped, but then Anderson was hurled across for 
the touchdown. Duffy kicked goal. W. & J., 19; 
Tech, 0.
Wimberleys great sprint up the field for 90 yards 
from the kickoff enabled the W. & J. scoring machine 
to make its next touchdown in six attempts. Fol

lowing the run Tibbens and Wimberley put the ball

After a short see-saw in midfield, Wimberley got 
loose for 25 yards to the Tech 15-yard mark, being 
do ,/ned by Hatcher. Wimberley made five yards 
more. Tibbens was pushed over for final touchdown. 
Duffy missed the goal. Score, W. & J., 30; Tech, 0.
Kime was substituted for Kochen by Tech. The

ple was an em big people telled us what our essuns 
was and what rooms we was to do to. When wTe dot

We had what em call science first. Some of us dot

THE TARTAN5
Wednesday being the real sesqui-centennialof the 
naming of Pittsburg, Miss Harding gave us a short
1 istory of the founding and growth of the city. No 
woman in Pittsburg is so able to do this as Miss 
Harding, and since hearing her civic pride has grown 
apace sbb our hearts.
HUSBANDS.
Husbands are the natural product of most civliized 
countries. They are plentiful in most of the United 
States of America, being scarcest in Utah and Mas
sachusetts, where each lady owns but a fraction of 
a husband or none at all. These owning no more 
than a morbid interest in a husband are called old 
maids.
Although the best husbands in the country are ac
knowledged by experts to be indigenous to the soil, 
those commanding the highest market prices are the 
imported varieties because of their expensive labels. 
The Crown brand brings the largest figure.
The husband is a wary and elusive animal, fleeing 
for safety at the first noise like a skirt to his lair in 
clubs, offices, and other remote caves of his habits; 
but he may be cajoled forth by an appearance of in
difference on the part of the trapper, as his curiosity 
can always be aroused by the strange creature who 
could remain immune to his charms, after which he 
may be easily caught anywhere in bro?d daylight 
(though a white night light or a moon calcium is, 
preferable) in a trap composed of fron-fron talcum, 
golden locks and flattery.
There is a tradition to the effect that the earliest 
husband catcher was a clumsy contrivance made of 
fine hand-sewing, attached to a spinning wheel, dec
orated with home-made preserves put up in a sirup 
of sweet disposition and sealed in common sense 
jars.
Once secured with a matrimonial halter tied in a 
diamond hitch, the husband usually becomes quite 
tame and will eat from the hand and sign checks at 
will. There are more than fifty-seven varieties of 
husbands at large and in community, but they are 
broadly classed as good and bad by their respective 
owners or keepers called wives. Since the wife is 
so constituted that she can believe anything she sets 
her mind to, she can easily persuade herself that a 
bad husband is a good one and vice versaa merci
ful provision of Providence for marital happiness.
The American husband is called by his trans-Atlan
tic compeers a beast of burden, to which he may 
very justly retort that the trans-Atlantic husband is 
a beast of prey, or otherwise, but always a beast, any
way. All of which proves that the highest grade 
husband extant has his permanent habitat in these 
United States ^f America.

THE TARTAN7
FIRST ARCHITECTURAL SMOKER A SUCCESS.CALENDAR.
The first smoker of the Department of Architecture 
for the year was held last Tuesday evening, Novem
ber 24th. The drawing room was bedecked in red 
and the lights were decorated with shades of the 
same color, the stools and tables being arranged in 
such a manner as to make the centers of attraction 
show off to the best advantage. After tobacco had 
been liberally passed around the following program 
was begun:
Professor Hornbostel, wearing one of his famous 
ties, began his speech amidst thunders of applause. 
He spoke chiefly of his recent trip to Europe and 
finished with a number of interesting stories.
Dean McGoodwin followed with a speech, in which 
he presented the prizes won by Seidner and Stockwell in the recent competition for a Gateway design 
for the Kingsley Home.
During the evening Render gave a number of violin 
solos, accompanied by Gardner. Professor Perrand 
loves all ze boys, all his remarks were confined to 
thrilling experiences in Paris. Mr. Zeller then made 
his entree. In a few moments he had everyone en
tranced by the marvelous manner in which he re
counted his initiation into the Beaux-Arts Society at 
Paris.
The dull red glow from the lights, the circular tier 
of faces and the hushed strains of oriental music 
were conducive to something theatrical. To satisfy 
the wishes of the crowd Nicols gave his Salome 
dance. This was followed by Joey Ihsens imita
tion of a man doing the clog dance. In the midst of 
an outburst of song, Mr. Hewlett was bodily carried 
into the room on the shoulders of a committee sent 
to find him. Placed upon one of the tables he began 
a speech, apologized, and finished his stunt by giv
ing several splendid selections on the piano. Robling sang two songs to Mr. Hewletts accompani
ment. Mr. Connelly was ushered in and forced to 
make a speech. Among the things he told were 
some of his fishing experiences with Professor Horn
bostel. More stories and songs rounded out a pro
gram of a most enjoyable evening.
Refreshments were served on the drawing tables, 
and only when the lights blinked at midnight did the 
first thoughts of leaving occur to any one. The af
fair was in charge of a committee consisting of 
Rigaumont, Shaub, Burkhart, Robling, Rodgers and
Bruton. _______

its faithful students when Death claimed 
Paul J. Muhr at the home of his mother, 
Mrs. Emma S. Muhr, at 2026 Wylie Avenue, 
on Monday morning, at 6:40. Always ap
pearing to be in delicate health, he was out 
some time this term on account of sickness, 
and was last present about a week ago. Grad
uating from the Pittsburg High School three 
years ago, he entered Tech and this year 
was a Sophomore Architect. The funeral 
services will be held from the family home 
this afternoon at 2 oclock. Services at St.

WM. PFOUTS.
Said the first old soldier will you give me a chew, 
so the old rhyme goes; said the second old soldier, 
well the most of us know what he said. But as has 
often been remarked before, there are times and 
times and we could, if pressed, recall the time, the 
place, and the man who if he didn't use the exact 
words mentioned above, certainly would agree with 
the sentiment of number one. And as we have said 
there are times and this would be one of the times 
when it would pay to conquer an inborn prejudice 
against donation parties and produce the package 
of Red Band or the plug of Piper Heidseick as none 
are barred.
But some might ask where are all these things 
liable to happen and for the unfortunates who have 
not learned by experience and for those who have 
forgotten this early, some of the expressions of the 
first years we elaborate more fully on the dramatic 
setting.
Can you not see a tall black-haired man standing 
in the upper corridor at. a spot where a good view 
of the pattern shop might be obtained, and can't you 
see that same man incline his head to signify that 
you might stand and deliver as per request of the 
veteran mentioned early in the article? Could the 
request and the stage setting conjur up any picture 
but that of Mr. Pfouts? And after you had complied 
with his request and seated yourself in his office 
chair wouldn't you be repaid for your generosity? 
For let it be known Mr. Pfouts has ideas and while 
not giving voice to them at all times, if pushed, is 
at no loss and leaves his hearer at no loss to under
stand his meaning. The topics? well they cover a 
range that we will not attempt to name, but he has 
opinions on them all. He Avas intended by nature 
to be a soldier and only the mere fact that our short
sighted country did not furnish us a war until he 
had become the head of a house prevented him from 
being one. But the old desire for danger is latent 
and lately a way was opened for him to mingle with 
his fellow men and still be in imminent danger. 
On the only occasion when our foot-ball team left, 
the city this fall he, in comapny with a couple of 
boon companions, went to the Pittsburg Indian 
and seating themselves in the midst of Pittsburg's 
rooters whooped it up for the Indian. If that isn't 
bravery, let's have an example that beats it.
While telling of the man we have almost forgotten 
the occupation. WellMr. Pfouts came here to in
struct aspiring youth in the mysteries of dovetail 
and mortise joints and how to make the foundryman 
gweep out all the molds. He had had a varied ex
perience as foreman of patternmakers with several 
of our largest machinery firms, the last being the 
Wm. Todd Machinery Co. Under his direction every 
Freshman has made one good wrench and quite a 
few have progressed to the point where they couldnt 
be told that knew nothing of patternmalving.
THE FOOT-BALL SEASON OF 1908.
Now that its all over, we can pause and look back. 
It has been a losing season, due to no fault of the 
team or those in charge. When everything is con
sidered, all Tech has reason to be proud of the result 
of every game that was played. During the past 
season we have played all kinds of teams, those of 
whom t.ieir college can be proud and those of whom 
they can't, and these are all the kinds of teams there 
are. The only satisfactory game is the one played 
with men who go in it for all there is in them, and 
when its over, you want to go up to every man on 
the team and say, I want you to know. I wish you 
played on our team. The fellows in the game know 
all about this, but this desire, caused by a clean 
game of foot-ball, is so contagiuos that all the grand
stands and sidelines know and understand, too.
Our schedule was a hard one and the team L'ght. 
The management is to be -congratulated on being 
able to play and bring to Pittsburg, teams of such 
standing, that the mere fact of having them on

our schedule, a school so young, is sufficient to give 
us the best standing with the other and older schools 
and colleges in the country.
This is the fourth year of the Schools and the 
third of the foot-ball team, and the first in which 
there has been any system about running the team 
and coaching it. To Knox is due the credit of intro
ducing and directing the systematic arrangement 
of things. There were more than double the number 
of men out for the squad this year than appeared 
last season; for this he is largely responsible. To 
the coaches who assisted with the work, Prof. Aude 
and Mr. Snitzer, is due a large portion of the credit 
for the carrying out of the aforementioned policy. 
We cannot refrain from making special mention of 
the services of the latter. Having no connection 
whatsoever with the Schools and receiving no recom
pense for his time and services, he faithfully attend
ed the practices and made himself extremely valua
ble, all for the pure love of the game. The spirit 
displayed by the student body in attending the games 
as well as they did, the services of the band, and the 
general improvement shown during the season, are 
all most commendable.
Although we lost a majority of the games played, 
the season was a successful one. When we defeated 
teams with comparative ease, that we could have 
scarcely considered a tie possible with a year ago, 
the advancement made speaks for itself. No doubt, 
but that at times we did fly a little high, and as we 
said before, were proud of it. If next years season 
shows the improvement this one did, there will be a 
likelihood of some persons we could mention, sitting 
up and taking notice.

Prof. James (on two meanings for see)You can 
see very little in Chemistry.
Class (in chorus)Your right, professor, we 
haven't been able to see anything(But it was a 
dumb class anyway.)
Prof. (in English)Define an interrogation mark, 
and give an example.

The class-pin committee has certainly worked hard 
and very successfully to obtain a satisfactory em
blem at a minimum cost. They deserve the thanks 
of the entire class for their efforts.
Dean Leets little at homes in the Registrars 
office are said to be splendid successes. The social 
elite of the class express themselves as very much 
gratified at the brilliancy which these affairs impart 
to the whirl of high society. However, strange to 
say, our invited guest never shows any signs of joy 
over hij elevation to aristocratic prominence. Per
haps they don't like pink tea.
How remarkable that the letter F which often 
ornaments our exam, papers, should be the first let

meant by it?
WINTER EVENING.
The moonlight gleams on the frozen ground,

On the wonderful picture framed, in light, 
Wrapt in the glory of the silent night.

It is customary at this time to announce the fact 
that Thanksgiving is history, and that we have re
turned to school. To introduce a little variety, we 
will let the reader discover it for himself, and go on 
with our narrative, which is about a first-year man, 
who was heard to make the following bright remark: 
Gee, but Im glad I have a good memory, why I can 
kill a case of blues just by dreaming of the good 
Mine I had yesterday.

PLEBE CLAS TEAM.
The class entering this year in Applied Science 
certainly should be given credit for the commendable 
spirit and enterprise they have shown, ihis is the 
first year that an attempt has been made to maintain 
a Plebe team, and the fact that this class has main
tained a successful team throughout the year is a 
matter for congratulations. The team played eight 
games, winning four, losing two and tieing two. The 
team scored a total of fifty-nine points to its oppo
nents fifty-four. Among the players in the cut print
ed in this issue there are several that are expected to 
make the Varsity next year. The games played and

GLOEKLER HELD UP.
(Special Cable to the Gazette Times.)
Paris, Nov. 27.Karl Gloekler, a student from 
Pittsburgh, had an unprecedented experience in 
Brussels ten days ago, where he was relieved of 400 
francs in a confidence trick. Mr. Gloekler came back 
to Paris a poorer but wiser young man. This morn
ing while sketching in the Louvre he became con
scious that a man behind him was watching his 
work. He turned around and saw one of the confed
erates of the bunco man who had robbed him in 
Brussels. The bunco man took him to a secluded 
corner and said: Look here, we hated to take your 
money, but you see we were in the green goods busi
ness for a living, so you must not blame us too 
much. Then he handed Mr. Gloekler 400 francs in 
notes and tP francs extra.
Gloekler has been in a sort of a trance ever since. 
He has deposited the extra 50 francs with the Amer
ican consulate, explaining that he couldnt keep it 
because it didn't belong to him.

Karl Gloekler is aged 21. He is a son of Charles 
A. Gloekler, of 5132 Friendship avenue, East End. 
Last June he won a scholarship at the Carnegie 
Technical School in a drawing competition, which 
provided for his education in achitecture in Brussels. 
He was in Hanover, November 12, where he wrote 
his parents that he would be in Paris November 14, 
and would come home immediately. His mother 
says she has been expecting him each day. She was 
happy when she learned from The Gazette Times 
that his money was returned.
CRAFTSMEN CLUB.
Mr. H. Zellman called a meeting of the Craftsmen 
Club to be held in Assembly Hall Friday evening, 
December 4th, 08, at 9.30 sharp. All journeymen 
students are requested to be present, as new mem
bers will be received and officers for the present 
year will be elected. A jovial time is assured all 
who attend.
Much credit is due Mr. Zellman, who presided, as 
he conducted the meeting par excellence, and after 
the meeting, members of the Craftsmen Club ren
dered a few songs, much to the credit of their Glee 
Club.
The attendance at the meeting was larger than 
was anticipated, so the supposition is that it will be 
much larger next Friday evening.
Zellman was about to call the Craftsmen to order 
when he asked, Has the Bricklaying Class been dis
missed?
Chorus-Yes, hes here.

1912 NightNotice.
The annual election of class officers will be held 
on Wednesday evening, December 9th, 1908, at 10:30 
oclock, sharp, at the regular class meeting in the 
Assembly Room.
A girl I once knew in Duquesne,
Who lived at the end of a luesne,
Received a bouquet
On a bright, summer duet,
But her quest for the sender was nuesne.
The lass said: I'm called a coquette;
And, though I flirt some, you can buette
It is only for him
And never a one
Can I get out out of my suette.
There was once a dudelet named Tate,
Who dined with his girl at eight eight,
But Id hate to relate what this dudelet named 
Tate,
And his tete-a-tete ate at eight eight.Ex.
Weber (in a downtown restaurant)Bring me a 
Welsh rearebit, two broiled lobsters, a bottle of im
ported ale, a pieqe of mince pie, and a tooth pick. 
WaiterWill you please write out that order and 
sign it, sir?
Weber"What for?
WaiterAs a sort of an alibi for the house to 
show the coroner, sir.
Didnt we tell you?
1913 was attended to Thanksgiving.
While on the road last summer, Stuart was asked 
by a kind lady of whom he had asked a favor what 
had been his last occupation. In response to his 
reply that he had been a valet in a sawmill, she 
exclaimed, A valet in a sawmill! Gracious me,
what sort of a job is that? What were your duties? 
I had to dress undres'sed lumber, was Stuarts 
witty reply.
Both Had Wheels."
It was a vehicle marriage
And this heading none could reproach;
She was a girl of graceful carriage
And he was a college coach.
1912 Defeats 1913, 75.
Last Thursday morning the annual foot-ball game 
between the two younger night classes was played 
on the Schenley Oval, 1912 again winning the con
test. Last year the 12 team defeated thell team 
and this year they have attended to the younger 
class.
The game was an interesting one from start to 
finish and as both teams had a host of rooters to 
cheer them on, feeling ran high.
1913 kicked off to Weber, who returned the ball 
ten yards for 12. After three downs Wayman car
ried the ball for 30 yards. Serrenda was tackled 
for a loss of about six yards and Wayman kicked 
over goal line. 1913 kicked from the 25 yard line, 
the ball, however, going out of bounds. 13 re
kicked, Wayman getting the ball and going 50 yards 
for a touchdown, but going out of bounds on the 
25 yard line. Time up. Score 0-0.
1912 kicked to 13, Farrell getting the ball. 13 
was forced to'kick, but Robison recovered the ball 
for them on bSs five yard line and on two attempts 
went over fqr a touchdown. 1912 kicked to Farrell 
for 13, who was tackled behind his own goal line.
1913 kicked to Wayman from their 25 yard line and 
he went for a touchdown. Score 7-5. With only a 
minute to play, 1913 kicked to Weber who returned 
the ball five yards. Time up. Final score '912, 7; 
1913, 5.
The playing was somewhat loose all through, 1912 
having put up a far better game than on previous 
occasions. Weber and Wayman were the stars of 
the 12 squad while Robison and Farrell did good

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FUTURE APPLI
CATION OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS.
(Concluded from last week.)
For irrigation service, the centrifugal pump sup
plies a definite demand among farmers. Belted to a 
gasoline engine and pumping into pipe lines distrib
uted over the fields in which sprays are inserted, the 
centrifugal pump is a boon to the truck-farmer, al
lowing crops to be raised on otherwise unproductive 
land. On a larger scale, centrifugal pumps of enor
mous capacity have been used for irrigation, water
ing whole acres of desert land by methods which 
only the centrifugal pump has made possible. I 
might mention here several such pumps in irrigation 
service at the Dale Stock Farm, Montana. These 
pumps which I had the privilege of designinng, con
sist of two double bP-inch outfits, with a combined 
capacity of u;PPP gallons per minute, and two single 
outfits each of 3,000 gallons per minute. All are belt
ed to Diesel Oil Engines, making an installation un
rivaled for economy of operation. This is one iso
lated example where a steam-driven or power pump 
was out of the question owing to vast difficulties in 
the way.
The United States Reclamation Service is now 
making large use of centrifugal pumps for irrigation, 
in extremely large units as a rule, and they have 
been found to be the best outfits procurable. These 
pumps must go into desert lands far from the ma
chine shops of civilization and only the simple and 
easily repaired manchine can be used. Irrigation 
problems are solved by these pumps which permit 
of no other known solution. The fact that the Gov
ernment, well known for its exacting requirements, 
prefers these pumps, is a certain guarantee of their 
value and superiority.
Again, the brewer finds the centrifugal pump val
uable in his work. Breweries are, as a rale, models 
of cleanliness, and no other pumping machine is so 
easily accessible, or so easily cleaned, as a centrif
ugal pump. Its comparative noiselessnes3 when in 
operation also commends it. There is installed in 
the N. Thomas Brewery at Dayton a 4-inch Brooks 
pump which raises 280 barrels of hot beer and hops 
direct from the brew-kettle to the Lop-jack, a 
height of 65 feet in 25 minutes. It replaced a wellknown make of rotary pump, common in breweries, 
which took nearly an hour to do the same work and 
was constantly requiring repairs. Its operation 
made such a terrific noise that conversation was 
utterly impossible in its vicinity. As a contrast, the 
Brooks pump does the work in half the time, com
paratively noiselessly, and, though it has now been

in operation considerably over a year, has never 
had any repairs. For cleaning it, this pump has a 
large drain placed at the lowest point so that steam 
can be blown through at intervals, keeping the in
terior sweet and clean.
The National Board of Underwriters, a most con
servative body, has now under way the preparation 
of specification for the use of centrifugal pumps for 
fire-service in factories and mills, and we will shortly 
see these pumps replacing the heavy, cumbersome 
unreliable steam duplex fire pumps hitherto used. 
As an instance of the economy of space combined 
with high efficiency which the centrifugal pump 
possesses we might mention the three-stage, onethousand gallon pump now being built for the Amer
ican Ship-Building Company to be installed on board 
a large lake boat for maintaining a fire pressure in 
their sprinkling system. This pump is to be driven 
by a 150 liorse-power Kerr steam turbine, making a 
most compact outfit.
A newer application of centrifugal pumps is in 
connection with a vacuum-cleaning system for clean-~ 
ing carpets, rugs, etc. Several of these outfits have 
been recently completed for a well-known New York 
firm. The pump used is a 120 gallon machine directconnected to an electric motor. A minimum space 
is secured by screwing the pump impeller on the 
motor shaft which is extended for the purpose. This 
makes a most compact and efficient outfit. The 
pump draws water from a small tank and discharges 
through a nozzle into the same tank. One opening 
from the nozzle is attached to a cylindrical drum in 
which a vacuum of from 27.5 to 20" of mercury is 
produced. From this drum a hose leads to the 
sweepers and the dust taken from the carpets is col
lected in the drum. The entire outfit is so small 
and light that there is no doubt it will &oon super
sede the old-fashioned air-pump driven by a heavy 
gasoline engine, now a familiar sight on our streets.
b have recently designed and now am having built 
a Brooks pump for handling a saturated solution of 
chlorine which is at a temperature of 60 deg. C. 
This pump will be so built as to have evei'y part 
coming in contact with the liquor covered with hard 
rubber. There is every indication that the experi
ment will prove a complete success, and if so, the 
easy, economical and satisfactory handling of all 
acids and acid liquors which attack iron or composi
tion metals will be assured. A concern in Germany 
is also perfecting a pump built entirely of stoneware 
for the same purpose, which they claim is proving 
successful. Our Company also has under way the 
lining of Brooks pumps with porcelain enamel to 
serve the same purpose.
One of the latest innovations of the same company 
is a centrifugal pump lined with carborundum. This 
pump will prove invaluable for handling sand, gravel 
and similar gritty materials. Probably the first ap
plication of it will be in the Florida phosphate dis
tricts handling the phosphate rock, which is proba
bly one of the most difficult substances known to 
pump, since it is almost as hard as a diamond.
