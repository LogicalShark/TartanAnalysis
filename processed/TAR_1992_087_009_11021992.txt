At Tuesdays Student Senate meeting, more amendments to the new bylaws of the student body were adopted. They included Student Senates fiscal policy concerning the funding of booth and buggy for independent organizations such as FRINGE and Pioneers. The changes in the proposed bylaws,
which originated in Senates Constitution Committee, chaired by Senator Greg Haverkamp (CIT), included stipulations that a new buggy may be funded by the Activities Fee once every four years (up from three years), and that Activities Fee money will fund no more than 50 percent of the cost of an organizations booth per year (down from 67 percent).Three proposals were made amend to Article VI, Sections F
and G of the proposed new bylaws. The first proposal was made by Senator Michael Loomis (GSIA) to change the time for funding of a new buggy from three years to four years, which passed by a vote of 13-6-1. Loomis says, [The proposal] was suggested to me by other people.... We read the proposals that were given by the Constitution Committee and basically cut the cost to what the

GSIA ranking plummets
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
Tartan Staffwriter
Because of low ratings from students, Carnegie Mellons GSIA is no longer among the nations 10 best business schools, according to Business Week's biannual 
survey.Student dissatisfaction among the class of1992 caused the business schools rankingto drop from ninth to 17th place, the largest drop of any of the top 20 schools ranked by Business Week in its October 26 issue.
Even though students found the administration to be the least responsive to student concerns of any of the schools in the top 20, GSIAs rating was bolstered by its high standing among corporate recruiters, who ranked the school ninth in the country, up two notches from the previous survey.To arrive at a schools rating, 
Business Week combines results from a questionnaire sent to graduating students from that school and results from surveys sent to 352 companies who recruit business school graudates.Robert Sullivan, dean of GSIA, said the precipitous drop in student ratings was caused by the changes taking place at the school.In the last few years, said Sullivan, We had the largest class with the smallest amount of space and no dean.We lost our biggest piece of the old GSIA building. We had an outgoing dean, then an interim dean in a caretaker sense.... The students wanted to send us a

Post-Gazette company buys Press
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Staffwriter
On Thursday, Blade Communications of Toledo, Ohio, the owners of the Pittsburgh PostGazette, announced its plans to purchase the Press Co. from Scripps. The Press Co. owns the 
The Pittsburgh Press and handles production and circulation of the 
Post-Gazette under a Joint Operating Agreement (JOA).The JOA is a complicated legal document signed by the management of the papers in 1961 designed to protect the weaker newspaper (the Post-Gazette) while ensuring that competition would survive. Under the agreement, the Press Co. is responsible for controlling advertising
sales, printing, and circulation of both newspapers. The Post-Gazette does not own any of the items necessary to produce and distribute a newspaper.Helen Kaiser is a 14-year veteran of The Pittsburgh Press newsroom, and although she enjoys writing her Ask the Press consumer advice column, she admits that morale at the Press is not very good right now.The mood of the editorial staff changes constantly, says Kaiser, Were sort of on a roller coaster ride right now.At a news conference Thursday, Blade Chair William Block Sr. said that the company feel(s) a great responsibility'to restore metropolitan journalism to the Pittsburgh area, but that there
are a lot of steps to be taken before that can happen. Blade Communications is a privatelyheld corporation owned by the 
Block family.Blade will first have to hold new contract negotiations with the unions that represent Press Co. workers before November 30. Scripps has said that if that deadline passes, it will shut the company down for good. Then, the Blocks will have to obtain financing necessary to purchase the 
Press. Scripps asking price for the Press Co. has been estimated at $95 million. Finally, the purchase will have to be approved by the Department of Justice to see if it violates the terms of the JOA.All of us are pretty subdued

THIS JUST INIII
Voters face difficult choice on Tuesday
WASHINGTON October 30 (DJ)  Voters going to the polls Tuesday will choose among the known, the unknown, and the unfathomable.After four years in office, George Bush is a familiar figure to most Americans. Despite his conservative campaign rhetoric, he is a moderate. He instinctively rejects claims from opposite sides of the ideological spectrum that government is either the cause of, or the solution to, most of the nations problems.If re-elected, he can be expected to labor more on domestic policy than he did in his first term, but will still face an enormous challenge dealing with an unfriendly and sometimes disrespectful Congress. He offers a steady hand on foreign policy, and would see to it that changes he has helped unleash on the world stage would proceed at a measured pace.A vote for Bill Clinton, on the other hand, is a gamble. As the first Democratic president in 12 years  and the first Baby Boom president and the first one elected after the end of the Cold War  he would have a rare opportunity to define a new course for the nation, much as Ronald Reagan did in 1981, Lyndon Johnson did in 1965, and Franklin Roosevelt
didin 1933. But if he succumbs to his tendency to want to please all, he could be pushed by powerful and competing special interest groups into a congressional muddle that would leave the nation worse off than before he started.Meanwhile, a vote for independent candidate Ross Perot is a leap into the dark. Perot talks like the ultimate pragmatist, without ideology. But events of the last few weeks have raised questions about whether he has the temperament to hold the nations highest office.Whoever is elected will face great uncertainty on the world stage, most notably the prospect of unrest during the coming politically turbulent winter in Russia. At the same time, the next president is likely to preside over a better economy than that which has saddled Bush for the past four years. Low inflation, low interest rates, corporate streamlining and reductions in consumer and business debt burdens have left the economy primed for a recovery some time in the next couple of years.But the real challenge for the next president will be addressing longer-term economic problems. Since 1973, the productivity of
American workers has grown at only a third of the pace of the 1950s andl960s and their average earnings have been stagnant. Its that poor performance that has led many people to question whether the steady rise in living standards that characterized the first four decades after World WarII is going to continue.Governor Clinton has proposals to take on that task by increasing government spending on education, training, public infrastructure, and research.Getting a Democratic Congress to boost spending in those areas wont be difficult. But for the program to succeed, a President Clinton also would have to demonstrate he has the spine to stand up to some powerful forces that have the potential to destroy his program. Whether or not he can resist them may well determine the success or failure of his presidency.If elected, Clintons first test will come within days of his inauguration. Will he propose a tough, credible, multiyear deficit reduction plan as part of the initial economic stimulus package he intends to propose? Or will he offer the goodies first and merely promise to do deficit reduction later?
Governor Clintons campaign proposals dont come close to addressing the deficit in a satisfactory way and many of the academic economists who advise him say deficit reduction can be put off until future years. But budget experts in Washington say a President Clinton would only have sufficient clout to wrestle with this thorny problem in the early days of his presidency.Economists agree that some wise public investments could help address both the economys short-term and its long-term problems. But in order to keep his program from turning into just another congressional porkbarrel, Clinton would have to stand up to some powerful legislative interestsmost notably Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who has delivered a cornucopia of federal projects to his home state.Another hurdle for Clinton would be Representative Richard Gephardt and other trade hawks in Congress. They wanted Clinton to pledge to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement and he resisted them. But there would be a constant struggle of Clintons avowed freetrade views against forces that, among other things, want to com
pel Japan to end its trade surplus with the U.S. or face automatic retaliation.A President Clinton would also have to face up to lawmakers from his own party who want to either raid the defense budget, or use it to finance unneeded but politically popular weapons programs. Many Democrats want to cut defense spending much deeper than does Clinton.Bush is bargaining, of course, that Americans will conclude that the kind of predictable, incremental change he offers is a safer bet in the new world that he has helped create in the last four years.Bush would try to revive the economy with increased tax incentives for private investment, a cut in the capital gains tax and, perhaps, an across-the-board income tax cut. He pledges renewed war on government regulations. And to stimulate the economy in the short run, he promises not a Democrat-style jobs bill, but rather more rapid expenditure of his already-enacted plan to spend billions on transportation construction.Bush promises neither the allout assault on the deficit that Perot advocates, nor the more laid-back deficit-cutting approach
of Clinton, but rather a continuing chipping away at the spending imbalance.And, as much as anything else, Bush bases his vision for domestic and foreign policy in the next four years on a spree of free-trade agreements in Europe, Asia, and 
Latin America to match his North America Free Trade Agreement.Perot, if elected, would come in with the clearest commitment to reducing the budget deficit through higher taxes and spending cuts. But whether he could get Congress to go along with his politically painful plan is far less clear. And even if he somehow succeeded in getting lawmakers to enact his plan, the net result could well be a rapid contraction of the economy  which then would antagonize lawmakers eager to escape blame for that outcome.The one thing an election of Perot would do is send the most unmistakable signal in the history of American politics that there must be an overhaul in the way government is run, not mere tinkering around the edges. But on the world stage, the combination of the uncertainty and Perots rhetoric of economic nationalism would shake up friends and foes alike.Polls indicate a tight Presidential race
WASHINGTON October 30 (DJ)  Support for Ross Perot is slipping, and where it goes probably will determine whether George Bush can pull off an upset in Tuesdays election.The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll gives Governor Bill Clinton a 44 percent to 34 percent lead over President Bush among registered voters, with Perot at 15 percent. Among those who vote regularly, Clintons lead drops to six points, 43 percent to 37 percent, with 13 percent for the Texas billionaire.The poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, with the only significant change between the two days being the decrease in the strength of Perot, the independent candidate.Though Perots share of the electorate is declining, his impact on the struggle for the White House may still be substantial because the waning days of the race are, at least in part, a campaign for voters who once found allure in Perot.Right now President Bush is benefiting most from Perots descent. The president has made gains with Republicans and with independents, among whom
Bush has climbed from third place into first, taking 32 percent as opposed to Clintons 30 percent. But voters who now are only loosely committed to Perots election favor Clinton as their second choice over Bush, 53 percent to 40 percent, suggesting a possible advantage to the Democrat if Perots support erodes further.Democrat Peter Hart and Republican Vince Breglio, the pollsters who conducted the survey for the Journal and NBC, say that the momentum of the trial heat favors George Bush.But they note that in the end, elections always come back to the fundamentals. And they say that the fundamentals of this election favor Bill Clinton.Clinton himself, in an interview, said that Im not all that distressed to see a tightening of the polls. But, he added, I need a big turnout, especially among young voters.In reporting the Journal/NBC survey, pollsters Hart and Breglio emphasize that it may be misleading to focus solely on people who vote regularly, because
this election could also drawmany people who vote less frequently.For that reason, the Journal is reporting the results among both registered voters and regular voters, which under the polls definition eliminates anyone who hasnt voted in half the elections in the past three years.The poll suggests that Bush still faces formidable challenges if he is to overtake the Arkansas governor in the campaigns final weekend. 44 percent of voters, asked to choose among a menu of elements that would affect their presidential choice, selected the economy as the top factor. At the same time, Bush is rated the voters third choice as the candidate who would do the best job on economic matters, winning the endorsement of only 21 percent of voters, compared with 33 percent who give the top rating to Clinton and 28 percent who choose Perot.There is no way to predict with certainty whether Perot will continue to slide and, just as important, whether Perot voters slip into the Bush or Clinton columns or decide simply not to vote.
Bush touts better economy
WASHINGTON October 27 (DJ)  President Bush said the 2.7 percent growth rate for third quarter Gross Domestic Product is very good news that will make it very hard for the nay-sayers and the pessimists opposing him on the basisofaweak economy.In an appearance on NBCs Today Show, Bush said the GDP growth report is about 30-some percent higher thanmostoftheestimatesanditshows that this economy is moving.Weve had unemployment down for three straight months and this is very good news for the American economy to have grown like that, Bush said. It is four times as much as the growth that Japan had in the same period. Referring to Democrats such as presidential rival Governer Bill Clinton who opposes Bush on grounds that he is responsible for the weak
economy, Bush said its going to be very hard for the nay-sayers and the pessimists, who can only win by convincing people how bad things are, to refute the fact that this is very encouraging for America.Bush remains a long shot, according to numerous analysts, however. With only a week to go, and allowing for those states that are beyond the margin of error, polls show Bush winning just four states with a total of 22 electoral votes.Asked to comment on the gloomy prospects for his re-election, Bush said All I know is, theres a sea of change in the country, and I feel it. Everybody traveling with us feels it...Theres something happening out there. Bush also announced that he would veto a $27 billion tax bill that supports Urban Enterprise Zones.

They found him sitting inside the Jeep and, since the man appeared very intoxicated, they assumed he was looldng for a place to sleep. They told him to get out and they watched him walk down Morewood Lane to Morewood Avenue. The student then called Campus Police. The man could not be found by responding police.

Pittsburgh daily news stili on holdThieves burglarize CFA studios
PRESS, from page 1and concerned not only about our future but the future of the Press," Kaiser said on Friday.Publication of the Press and the separately owned Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette was suspended on May 17 when delivery drivers for the Pittsburgh Press Co., represented by the Teamsters, walked off the job over a breakdown in 1 contract negotiations. The Press Co. wanted to eliminate 450 of 605 union jobs by putting a new distribution system in place.The strike is the longest in Pittsburgh newspaper history. The Press Co. is owned by the E.W. Scripps Co. of Cincinnati. Local media observers were shocked last month by Scripps announcement that it plans to sell the paper.Bill Deibler, managing editor of the Post-Gazette, said that the mood there is better than at any time since the strike began.We here at the Post-Gazette are very optimistic, Deibler said, but were not out of the woods yet. The owners of the paper have a major battle ahead of them try
ing to negotiate with the unions.Eric Devereux, an assistant professor of political science and public policy at the Heinz School, said that the chances of Pittsburgh remaining a two-newspaper town are very slim.Throughout history, every time one newspaper has purchased a competing newspaper, the result has been that one of them has been shut down, Devereux said. The long-term trend has been for every city to have only one newspaper.Even the Scripps Co. was dissatisfied with the profitability of thePressoperation. The economics of the situation are such that [Blade Communications] would make money by operating both papers, but not as much, said Devereux. Increasingly, the newspaper induBt)7isdominated by the profit motive. Its not about just making money, but maximizing your profit.Devereux believes the distribution problem is a major obstacle to be overcome. Its hard to distribute anything in Pittsburgh, ho said, and Pittsburgh is one of the few cities still using the antiquated system of delivery that it does. The distribution problem was another reason that the Post-Gazette might survivo instead of the Press, he said, because it's easier to deliver a morning paper than nn evening paper. Tho circulation of the evening paper is significantly larger than that of the morning paper, but this is not the case in
most major cities.The Justice Department might block the sale of the Press Co. to the Blocks on the grounds that it violates anti-trust laws, but Deibler believes that is highly unlikely.The number one obstacle I see will be reaching an agreement with the unions, said Deibler, but Im highly optimistic. The unions have been been sending out signals for weeks that they would welcome the opportunity to talk with the Blocks, [who] have an excellent history of labor negotiations.'The unions have been saying all along that they wanted to do business with the Blocks. I dont know why, said Madelyn Ross, the managing editor of the Press. Theyve never done business with the Blocks before ... and it seems to me that if you only have one newspaper to deliver, you need fewer newspaper deliverers. She added that she hasnt understood anything that the unions have done.My personal opinion is that the Block family will shut [the 
Press] down. That would be a shame, Ross said. We were fortunate to have two competing newspapers in this town. When you have two competing papers, you have the town well-covered. It seems pretty obvious that they wont need two newspaper staffs, and a lot of excellent people will be going elsewhere, and thats a shame.We spent the last 10 years putting together what is probably one of the best newspaper staffs in the country, Ross said. The Press has won two Pulitzer Prizes for journalism. Block said at the news conference that the 
Post-Gazette will definitely be hiring editorial staffers from the 
Press. Some sources estimate that between 50 and 75 Press staffers would join the new operation.Long-time Post-Gazette columnist Peter Leo called the situation a real reversal of fortunes.We at the Post-Gazette are quite happy that the Block family has stepped in, Leo said, because the JOA was about to expire at the end of the century and its likely that the Post-Gazette would have been out ofbusiness."We're basically 140 journalists and a nameplate, Leo said. Were tenants. Before, we were just along for the ride. Everyone assumed that we were the weak sister in the partnership.... We couldn't negotiate with the unions, we were just held hostage.Deibler agreed that the economics of the situation probably
dictated Pittsburgh becoming a one newspaper town. However, in his opinion the best of all possible solutions would be that both papers would continue operating.I think that it has occurred to everyone that this is the last opportunity to save the newspapers in this town, Deibler said. If this goes down the drain, youre not talking about losing 200 jobs [atthePress], youre talking about 1,200 jobs and possibly leaving Pittsburgh without any newspapers.As the strike dragged on, the members of the editorial staff at thePress mounteda petition drive to express their support for the continued publication ofthe citys two dailies. Their campaign was called Save the PresB, and they have collected approximately 15,000 signatures of area residents concerned for the future of the papers.The [Save The Press campaign] is not a management thing, or a union thing, said Kaiser, one of the leaders of the group. We just want to give the commu
nity a chance to say what the newspapers mean to them.According to Kaiser, the movement was designed to make the Press Co. more attractive to prospective buyers. We wantto show that the community cares about the paper, and that the staff is dedicated to it.Kaiser said that the newspapers provide an invaluable service to western Pennsylvania residents. The strike has proved to be a majorinconvenience. People miss the analytical background that the newspapers provide, says Kaiser. I think that the papers serve as part of a wellrounded information service to the community... when you need to know the depth of the issues, you will turn to the newspaper.I think that the Save the Press committee cannot help but feel positive about the fact that a newspaper voice is coming back, Kaiser said. So our campaign was realized in that regard. But everyone here is pretty downhearted [about the future of the Press]. Save the Press activities are on hold for the time being, but Kaiser said that if anyone still had petitions circulating that they were welcome to send them in.Deibler said it might be a while before Pittsburgh gets its dailies back.Its going to be a long battle getting back into business after five or six months, he said. It is very unlikely that we will be able to resume publication before January 1.
CFA, from page 1
Campus Police often failB to secure the doors at those times, according to some students.Junior art major Sherri Johnson thinks that security should be tightened.I have never found the doors locked at any time, said Johnson.Christine Cocca, a senior art megor, suggests patrols be increased.In three years that Ive had a studio in Doherty, Ive never seen Campus Police in the
halls, she said.Campus Police declined to comment.Even though seniors and students taking advanced courses are eligible for studio space, some students opt not to accept a studio, preferring to work elsewhere instead.Faye Levine, a senior illus
tration mtyor, said, I didnt want a studio space, even though I was entitled to one this year. When I was a sophomore, my classmate had her drawing damaged and the roll of paper it was attached to stolen. The same year my friend had his studio vandalized by other art students. What kind of working environment is that?

Senate enacts new booth, buggy rules
SENATE, from page 1
Constitution Committee has decided, so we did it in a way that wouldnt have much of an impact on independent organizations. Senator Michael Tomblyn (MCS) also favored the first proposal. I feel that the Student Activities Fee can be put into much better use and fund a greater number of
independent organizations agree that the change in the fiscal policy is very minor in terms of booth and buggy funding. As it stands, I really dont think a significant burden is being placed on organizations, says Jay Laefer, student body treasurer.
Toscano of FRINGE agrees that the new fiscalgroups and quality activities that will benefit the policy is not going to make a major difference entire campus rather than 20 students in one Welding of Pioneers says, Its unfortunate but we organization getting $6,000 to build and maintain could have gotten a worse end of the deal. Im glad particular booth or buggy. Larry Toscano, chair that the outcome of buggy happened the way it of FRINGE, adds that the proposal will not make did._ HifTorpnPii Tf irnn Vioi4-nnV.a major difference. If you dont have a'new technology, you dont build, [and] if youre building every four years, youre actually paying less to build.The second proposal made about booth and buggy during the Senate meeting was to lower the percentage that independent organizations had to pay for the cost of buggy. The proposed bylaws stated that organizations must provide at least 50 percent ofabugfgys cost from non-subsidyincome. The proposal restored the amount to the percentage in the current fiscal policy  33 percent. The amendment passed by a close vote of 9- 8-4. Tomblyn, who voted against the new proposal, says that the reason some Senators voted for the proposal was that they thought funds had already been taken care of by the first amendment.I didnt think that went far enough, says Tomblyn. Id like to see a time where independents can actually be independent and that they dont have to rely on Senate. A lot of people thought that hitting them with both [amendments] would be too severe in too short of time, and thats why the proposed bylaw failed. Loomis, who abstained from voting, says that independent organizations
Concerning the new fiscal policy, Haverkamp says, I think it will require more fundraising, but were more than likely to pass a provision ... to allow groups to keep anything that they earn. According to Haverkamp, Student Senates proposed bylaws are expected to be voted upon on Tuesday, November 24.Altmann says that the bylaws are an improvement. In the past, there were separate documents________________________________________ for the Con-stitutionand the fiscal policy. Then, the first thing Student Senate did was have a Constitution, Senate Bylaws, and the fiscal policy, and it was unclear why the division was made between the Constitution and the bylaws. So now, we have them all in one document, so they can go out in packets to the organizations. That enabled getting a lot of the redundant stuff out.Loomis agrees that as a whole, the bylaws are really good. However, in response to the entire booth and buggy issue, Tomblyn says, Enrollment is dropping across the nation, and its dropping at CMU. Its either becoming a little more fiscally responsible or raising the Student Activities Fee." Welding says that Student Senate is a wasteful
One of the things that bothers me 
about booth is the amount of waste, 
and thats why I strongly supported the 
reduction of funds by Student Senate.

iireally cant afford to pay more than one-third of organization. He says, I wish that they couldi
their buggy. I favor keeping the percentages the control their spending in other ways. same, because what we had already done is we have effectively reduced the amount of funding last year.Booth funding was the subject of the third pro' posal made during the Senate meeting. The proposal lowered the percentage of booth funding by independent organizations from 50 percent to 33 percent, thus making Student Senate contribute two-thirds, instead of one-half, of their booth funding. This amendment did not pass, with a final vote of 5-11-3. Tomblyn also voted against this proposal, saying that Senate is throwing a lot of money into [booth] that benefits directly only a small amount of people. Senator Erik Altmann (SCS), who also voted against the proposal, says,One of the things that bothers me about booth is the amount of waste and thats why I strongly supported the reduction of funds by Student Senate. However, Paul Welding, the president of Pioneers, was angered by the booth cuts. We dont ask for that much money, but now, we are going to have to twist arms to get funding.Overall, both Senators and representatives from

CLINTON, from pngo 1
packin back to Texas,"' You cant veto this Bill, I love Ozone Man," Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual people belong to families just like yours, Bush is the past. Clinton is the future, and Read my lips. No more Bush were among some of the signs at the rally.Clinton shared the stage with a sign language interpreter. Speaking on the major themes familiar from his months of campaigning, he covered topics including his national service proposal that would allow people who want to go to college to obtain the money to do so in exchange for two years of domestic service after graduation, and his plans to increase the number of American jobs.
Ho took tho time to address tho concerns of tho USAir employees in the crowd, explaining that he did not wholeheartedly support, the USAir/British Airways merger as it presently stands, because he wants to obtain the same kind of access to British markets for American companies that British companies have to American markets.Clinton called putting the American people first and rebuilding the middle class the goals of his administration. His statement, I'll make mistakes cause Ill get up every day and do something," brought a loud roar from the crowd. Clinton also addressed the name-calling and mud-slinging coming from the Bush campaign.
Responding to Bush characterizing Clinton and his running mato A1 Gore as bozos, Clinton said, Bozos make people laugh. Bush makes people cry. People are going to be laughing on Tuesday.He expressed outrage that the  Bush administration was investigating his mother's passport files, describing three men in expensive suits searching through dusty passport files after hours, saying, Thats the only time theyve worked till 10 o'clock in their lives.Wofford said, WhenI put John Kennedy on the plane 30 years ago, I got this tingly feeling in my spine, knowing that the next time Id see him he would be the President-Elect.

University construction continues
By MIKE WALKER
Tartan Staffwriter
According to President Mehrabians October 8 state of the University address, there are currently between $105 million and $110 million worth of capital projects in varying stages of completion either on the CMU campus or CMU-related.In the latest GSIA Building Addition Design and Construction Update, it was reported that the addition to and renovation of the GSIA building will be completed early next year, both on its budget of $13.7 million and on time. Most features of the addition are more than 75 percent completed.Mehrabian reported in his address that CMU has committed
to build, through state funding, the $16 million Pittsburgh Technology Center.Completion of the Center will allow for a relief from overcrowding of departments including MCS, CMRI, Supercomputing, Technology Transfer, and Extensive Educational Programs.Renovations to tho Naval Building, costing $2.5 to $2.6 million, are required because new space is going to be needed for displaced activities and organizations during the construction of the new University Center.All plans are complete and bids are now being taken for the new $40 million University Center. Phase one of the construction, which includes the relocation of the tennis courts, is set to begin November 9.
The beginning of phase two, which includes the transferal of student organizations to the Naval Building, is dependent upon numerous fundraising issuos coming into placo on schedulo.There are a number of planned projects which have not boon begun duo to a lack of funding.Among thoso aro plans for nn Electronic Materials Technology building, for which $10.0 million of an estimatod $15 million has boon raised; plans for an Art Contor, for which $5 million of tho $18 million prico has boon raised; and $8 million worth of desperately needed renovations and upgrading for tho chomistry lab, where $1 million has already boon raised but $1.5 million more will be needed to begin the first phase of renovation.

We want a practical 
University Center
For the past 10 years, the administration and the University 
Board of Trustees have prom
ised us a University Center. 
Skibo has been scheduled and 
rescheduled for demolition. Now 
the word is that work on the 
tennis courts will definitely start 
next week. Weve heard this be
fore, and we hope its really go
ing to happen this time.
What it comes down to is this: 
We want a University Center. 
The reason its been delayed so 
many times is that gifts have not 
come through to fund the project. 
The University has planned a 
$40 million building. This is ex
cessive, and the design is for a 
building that will not meet stu
dents needs.
For the same amount of money 
or less, we could have a building 
thats better than Skibo without 
unnecessary perks. For example, 
the University Center design 
includes athletic facilities that 
belong in the gym, not the stu
dent union building. Overhaul 
the gym and put a better pool, 
the indoor track, and racquetball courts there.
We do need other types of fa
cilities in the University Center 
to serve the needs of the campus 
community  facilities that ei

allows for about the same amount 
of meeting space as is available 
in Skibo. Any member of a stu
dent organization who has tried 
to reserve a meeting room and 
found none available knows this 
is inadequate. We need lockers 
so off-campus students have a

Wed like to see Entropy ex

of food and household goods, as 
well as newspapers and maga

Office should be moved from 
Baker Hall to the University 
Center, so theyll be centrally 
located.
An auditorium, a quiet study 
lounge (where there are no ar
cade games within hearing), and 
an improved ballroom are in
cluded in the design of the Uni
versity Center, and thats great. 
Unfortunately, there are mis
placed facilities included in the

us what we need without being

time to make a choice
Tomorrow is November 3, the 
day all Americans who are regis
tered to vote go to the ballot box 
and make their voices heard, 
demonstrating their support for 
the person they think will run 
their country in the best possible 
way.
In theory.
: The fact that voter turn-out for 
any given election is so damna
bly low can shake any persons 
faith in democracy and the 
American form of government. 
When power and decision-malting is entrusted to the citizenry 
rather than the elite, those citi
zens have a responsibility to tell 
the government what is working 
and what is not. That power is 
embodied in the vote.
When you cast your vote for an 
incumbent office holder, you com
municate your satisfaction with 
that persons policies, ideas, and 
actions in that office. You do not 
think the challenger could do 
the job better, and you would be 
happy with the incumbent in his 
or her position of power for an
other term.
When you cast your vote for a 
person other than the incum
bent, you are expressing your 
dissatisfaction with current poli
cies, ideas, and actions in the 
contested public office. You think 
this challenger could do the job 
better than the incumbent has 
done the job, and you think you 
would be happier with the chal
lenger, with whose potential poli
cies you agree, in office.
When you do not cast a vote, it 
means you hold no opinion and 
no preference for either side. You 
do not care that the people in 
power can shape your standard 
of living, your representation, 
and your taxation.
Change must be for good, 
not just for its own sake
Letter to the Editor
You do not care that the people 
in power can indiscriminately 
take away your job or your edu
cation on a misinformed whim. 
You do not care that the people 
in power can sell their power, 
curry favor to special interests, 
or make illicit money in other 
ways because of their position. 
You do not care that people in 
power can abuse that power if 
they are not checked by those 
who elect them.
When you do not vote, you have 
no right to complain when the 
person in power enacts laws or 
policies that hurt you or the way 
you live. When you give up your 
vote it means that you also give 
up your hold on power in the 
country as a whole. When you 
forfeit your right to vote it means 
that you are not represented, and 
that you willingly subject your
self to the whims, desires, and 
decisions of a small group of 
people who may not know or care 
about problems in your state, 
community, or home. When you 
abandon the right to vote, you 
lose any and all influence on the 
events and decisions that govern 
your country.
Arguments against voting, like 
the futility of the electoral col
lege, the immensity of the popu
lation, or the fact that America is 
a republic and not a democracy 
dont hold any water. If you ex
amine the elections of Kennedy 
and Nixon, you see that in each 
voting precinct, only a few thou
sand votes made the difference 
in how that precinct reported its 
vote as a whole to the state, and 
then to the nation. The above 
arguments do not invalidate the 
importance of every single vote, 
they only hide it.
Go vote tomorrow.
Editor:Americans are fed up, and we are not going to take it anymore. The government cannot or will not do anything about the dire problems of the nation. We need a change. How many campaign platforms of the 1992 election have been built around the theme time for a change? Each of the three major candidatesevenBushthe incumbent  played on this idea to some extent, some more than others. When everyone starts talking about the same thing, the original point tends to get distorted; so, what brought us to this need for something different, and will a set of all-new ideas really make our problems solvable?We decided we need a change, but what kind of change? New political catch phrases echoed throughout the recent debates: Bush looks forward to the new House, while Perot prefers the more general cleaning house versus slow dancing with the issues. These terms do not necessarily spell out the guidelines for a change maker. What do dissatisfied voters want in a candidate? Certainly not political experience. Anyone, they say, who has worked in a governmental position is either a contributor to, or a product of the system, and we certainly cannot have that. But our candidate, they continue, has to know how to get things done. This person has to do what is necessary to get the country revitalized, and this person must please the populace while achieving these goals. This person must have new ideas but also hold specific opinions on certain key issues. Why dont we ever have any candidates like that?Our responsibility as voters is to consider, reasonably, the choices before us. We cannot go to the polls or fill out our ballots with the mentality that choosing the lesser of two or three or fifteen evils is going to produce some idealistic political upswing, just as we cannot expect a single candidate to encompass all of our prerequisites. Now that the nation is relearning the importance of the vote; we cannot allow our power of dissatisfaction to overshadow what is good for the country as a whole. Even if we are fed up we cannot afford to lose our heads.

Clinton simply doesnt 
have ideas or experience
Letter to the Editor
Editor:Why does Clinton deserve my vote? Let me point out what Clinton did for Arkansas. Economically, Arkansas is 50th in average hourly earnings for production workers, 48th in disposable income, and 47th in per capita income. Since investing in Arkansas didnt work, why would it work for America? On education, Arkansas ranks 50th in college graduation rates and 49th in high school graduation rates. What has Clinton actually done for education? On the environment, Arkansas
The Institute for Southern Studies, The Green Index, 50th in governmental action to protect the environment, 41st in per capita ozone depleting emissions, and 41st in clean rivers and streams.So what is it that people like about Governor Clinton? Maybe its the fact that hes balanced a budget. In Arkansas exists a balanced budget amendment. Good idea, right? Bush proposed a balanced budget amendment. The democratically-controlled Congress vetoed this measure. It seems Congress likes to spend our money with no limits. According to Paul Harvey, Gore, in all his days in the Senate, has never voted against a spending increase!So what has Bush done? On economic growth, Bush, in 89, asked Congress to lower the capital gains tax in order to stimulate investment. In January 92, he again asked for a lower capital gains tax plus incentives to small businesses to create jobs and provide a $5000 tax credit to the middle class buying their first home. Congress did nothing good for three years. What did Congress do? They raised taxes on small businesses and offered a tax cut to the middle class. Did Congress finally do something right? Well, if you consider a 55 cent per day tax break a good way to help the economy, then I guess they did.Do you want Bill Clinton to do for America what he couldnt even do for his own small state? Before voting, keep in mind who has the better ideas, who has the proper experience, and whom do you trust.

Student calls for votes for 
Bush, not Slick Willie
Letter to the Editor
Editor:As election day draws near, I would like to make a request for votes for President George Bush and votes against Slick Willie.I admit, Bush has made some mistakes in his governing of our beloved country, but nowhere as bad as the major media and the liberal weirdos out there would have you believe. Bush has presided over our nation with dedication and good will, attempting to guide the world into the next century with a strong hand and a clear vision of what the future should hold. He has stood up for the American dream by keeping those tax and spend Democrats away from the taxpayers pocketbook, save the Budget Deal of1990. (Bush even recognized this mistake of giving in to the irresponsible Democratic Congress and apologized for it.) On the other hand, Slick Willie loves taxes so much he could slap a tax on a galloping horse. Quite a remarkable feat I must admit but not uncommon for a Democratic presidential aspirant. (I believe their party has a litmus test on this issue.)Bush has been a world leader in a vast number of issues. Hes stood up to unprovoked aggression by Saddam Hussein, hes fought for the lowering of agricultural subsidies in the current GATT negotiations, and hes helped accomplish the unbelievable  the fall of the Soviet Empire. The only time Slickconsistently ranks lowest according to Willie has ever set foot on foreign soil
was to smoke some wacky * protest lithe election of Slick Willie our world respect will ccrease and with Slick ___helm, the President of the U.S. longer be the worlds leader * today. (Even more than that, i that if Slick Willie wins, we paying taxes through the nose _ turn me on either.)Th 1992 election should properly. titled, Slick Willies campaign of saying anything he can to get elected. Lets not elect a pathological liar with a terrible record on the issues of character and trust, or a person who has absolutelyno involvement in foreign affairs.Please vote for a man who has pro^gR his ability to be a world leader, and ^ a man who will only follow the evjfty whim of a tax and spend, and sock it,to the middle class democratic congress,,,

Bush administration restricts legal procedures
Abby Schiff
I The question of abortion is a ^engitive one, an issue over which nation finds itself increas
ingly polarized. Yet the flood of 'controversy over whether abortion. is right or wrong has convinced many Americans, myself included, that any attempt to resolve the issue through debate is hopeless. It is a circular argument. Neither side can prove its j:ase, and even as a pro-choice Advocate, I will resist the temptation to try. Instead, Id like to focus on the Bush administrations record of imposing restrictions on choice and on abortionrelated issues, for this record may prove even more important than 'abortion issue itself.
\ First, the facts: abortion is le^Hn the United States. WhetherE
usla likes it or not, abortion has een a legal option throughout his Presidency. Thousands of jggmen have exercised this right Jtarmg each of his four years in 
pffic.emeaning, for better or for Bfifcge, that a lot of abortion procedures have been performed despite vocal opposition. In the Face of these facts, Bush, pro-life for "the moment, has had to make an important choice: restrict the stapgly of abortions or reduce delitand for them.'"It"isnt too difficult a task to pinpoint the direction Bush chose. Afw notable examples of the Bush-Quayle legacy are: the gag rule, which forbids doctors at federally-funded clinics from even mentioning abortion as an option for1 their patients; a ban on renh using fetal tissue from Abortions; and support for a SupFeMe Court ruling that allows states to impose waiting periods findparental notification/consent restrictions on women seeking abortions. The Bush-Quayle pattern thus reveals to us two things: first; Bush considers womens rights a low priority; and second, his administration suffers from an utter lack of respect for all
The gag rule is perhaps the most alarming example of Bushs indifference to womens rights. Although abortion remains a legal option in America, poor women who go to federally-funded clinics wouldnt know that because their doctors arent allowed to tell them about it. This means that poor women dont have the same rights  or as many options  as women who can afford the luxury of paying for a private gynecologist. The fact is, abortion is a lawful option; forbidding doctors from telling their patients the truth simply because certain people object to it is indefensible. Ignoring tjie law of the land and telling doctors what they can and cant say also poses a severe threat to the quality of womens health care; the last time I checked, neither Bush nor Quayle had a degree in medicine.The Bush-Quayle administration clearly places a higher priority on restricting abortion than it does on womens access to quality health care, and it doesnt think much of a womans ability to make her own decision in regard to which legal medical procedure she will undergo. Regardless of ones stance on the issue of abortion, this is cause for alarm. Considering the grave dangers it poses to womens access to non-politicized health care, there is absolutely no justification for the gag rule as long as abortion is a safe and legal medical procedure.Bushs stance against fetal tissue research is also disturbing. Few people are pleased about the high number of abortions performed in the United States, but at least some good might emerge from it: use of fetal tissue has shown promising results in the treatment of Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and a host of other diseases that' claim thousands of lives each year. But Bush firmly opposes using fetal tissue from abortions for research, claiming that women will be more likely to opt for an abortion if they know it might help save the life of a Parkinsons victim. Instead, Bush supports research on fetal tissue from miscarriages and ectopic
pregnancies for disease treatment  even though most scientists insist that it is usually worthless for this purpose.If Bush really believes that women will get more abortions if fetal tissue is used to save lives, he has a lot to learn about womens intelligence and strength of morality. First of all, getting an abortion is not a frivoown.Apparently, Bush and Quayle think abortion is some kind of spur-of-the-moment decision, complete with Buy One Get One Free promotions and high-pressure sales tactics. If only they would realize that it is anything but the walk-in appointment operation they make it out to be, they might realize that women
Men and women everywhere must

the motive, the intentional undermining 
of womens access to a legal procedure 
is wrong.
lous choice for any woman. A lot of careful thought and soulsearching is involved with a decision as serious as this one. The reason behind a womans decision to choose abortion is, first and last, that she does not want to continue the pregnancyend of story.In response to Bushs implicit assertion that the lifesaving capacity of aborted fetuses will influence women who would otherwise continue with the pregnancy, I contend that a woman with an unwanted pregnancy is at least as virtuous as anyone else, and will trust her own convictions no matter what. Women should be alert to the fact that Bush feels they cannot be trusted to make intelligent decisions should fetal tissue research become a factor. His lack of faith in women is so strong, in fact, that he is willing to let thousands of Alzheimers and Parkinsons patients die needlessly rather than trust women to think carefully about their actions.Finally, Bush applauded the recent Supreme Court decision allowing states to impose severe restrictions on womens access, to abortion. He supports a Waiting period of 24 hours, from the time a woman requests an abortion to the time her request is granted  again calling into question a womans ability to give the issue serious thought on her
think about it regardless of a waiting period, and that such a measure will only cause women more trauma and hardship once they have already made this difficult decision.Parental consent is another restriction supported by Bush, the Supreme Court decision, and, surprisingly, Bill Clinton (in some form). Remember, though, that Clintons support for parental consent is probably more open to modification than Bushs, due mainly to the differences in their respective constituencies: moderates and liberals on the one hand; conservatives, reactionaries, and religious fanatics on the other.The justification for parental inform and consent is that a girl under 18 is not mature enough to make the decision to abort (she 
is, however, mature enough to raise and support the child should she decide to continue the pregnancy). This measure is basically a solution for a problem that hardly exists; most young women in this situation do in fact tell their parents about it, and theres ample reason to believe that the ones who dont do so have a fairly good reason. Pleading her case before a judge only makes the procedure all the more traumatic for a young woman, and there are documented cases of teenagers who have sought illegal abortions in order to avoid parental notification or having to obtain judicial bypass. Young women have even died as a result of these botched back-alley procedures. Is this what Bush wants? Apparently, this is exactly what Bush wants. Its clear, looking at his record on abortion restrictions, that he thinks very little of womens moral and intellectual capabilities. He also lacks a clear understanding of one of the principles upon which our nation is based: equal treatment under the law. His administration has succeeded in undermining access to abortions, which, in Bushs eyes, is the next best thing to outlawing all abortions.Even if abortion should be made illegal, as Bush and Quayle believe, it must become the official law of the land  not what is right according to Bush. He has no grasp of the difference between what is and what should be, and the restrictions he has placed on abortion demonstrate this clearly. Bush even vetoed or threatened to veto Congress efforts to legislate protection to women from these unjust policies.According to the Bush administrations doctrine, women need a lot of people telling them what they should and . shouldnt do when they choose to exercise their legal rights. Women cant be trusted to give the matter of abortion much thought; that burden falls upon Bush, Quayle, and other great minds of the 20th century.Lets put aside, for the moment, the issue of whether abortion itself is right or wrong. Men and women everywhere must realize that no matter how righteous the motive, the intentional undermin
ing of womens access to a legal 
procedure is wrong. A fact of immediate concern to all Americans, regardless of their stance on abortion, is that women deserve a lot more credit than Bush is willing to give them. Remember it when you vote on Tuesday.

The Editors Notebook
- JI will be immensely relieved when this election is over. I enjoy politics, and political debates and arguments have provided hours of amusement for the past fewmonths. But I am absolutely sick and tired of the mud-slinging, character-trash
ing, dirty tricks-accusing of all the candidates. No one is immune, from the Presidential candidates to those running for spots in local government  as their advertisements display so clearly.Political candidates are sadly underestimating the intelligence of the American public, and I, for one, am insulted. By focusing on negative images in their advertising, the impression is that candidates would rather sling mud than talk issues. Well, what these people are really interested in are National Enquirer headlines. So why should we bother with Wall 
Street Journal issues? Heres a hintits
because those issues will determine the way people vote.I dont care who slept with whom, or who can spell, or whether Millie the dog should be the next Secretary of State. I care about what the candidates are going to do about education, how they propose to deal with children living in poverty, how they will accomodate the fact that elderly people are the fastest growing population in the United States. I want to know how they will balance jobs and the environment, if I will have a job when I graduate, and, yes, how their stands on abortion will affect me.This year is the first time I will vote for
the President of the United States. I want to elect a candidate who will answer these questions honestly and not spend all of his time telling me what a horrible person the opponent is. Unfortunately, what we get every time we turn on the television is another dose of negative advertising, peppered with innuendo and the dire consequences of electing one of the other candidates. Whether the candidates I support are elected or not, Tuesday night will be the welcome end to a disappointing trend of negativism in political advertising at least until next time. M.K. Rodgers

Senator calls for 
editorial fact checks
Editor:-As an indi
vidual Senator,
on
not necessarily Letter to 
the^eweofthe the EditorEntire Senate, I would like to respoiid to several allegations and 
^representations circulated in last weeks editorials.the first editorial, it was stated that a referendum was H&eessary whenever Senate is JTing to get away with somehing.... The implication that ehdte would try to slip anything y the student body is reprehenWe, and I have not seen one instance of such an event during my^enn on Senate. Also , it almost seems according to the edi
torial that the Senate is in agreement with the proposed bylaws and is debating with them with the student bodyuntrue, since Senate has totaled over 12 hours in deliberating said bylaws.In the second editorial, the allegation was made that Senate has been fiscally irresponsible because we did not take into account the fact that enrollment is down this semester, and that we therefore have less funds to spend as a result. The truth of the matter is that we allocated the majority of the money for this semesters budgets during last semester, and did not discover the fact that enrollment was down until less than a month ago. The Tartans misrepresentation of Senate in this case is reprehensible  even in an editorial, it is standard procedure to check your facts, is it not?I would like to point out that the majority of Senate money goes to keep the public informed  for Public Relations, Copying & Reproduction, a salary for the secretary (so that we have minutes of public record), and telephone usage. If we cut our budget to attempt to cover the deficit incurred by lower enrollment, we would fail to inform our constituents of our proceedings, which
(judging from the amount of vacant seats) is still currently a problem with Senate.In the future, I call on the Editorial Board of the Tartan to check their facts and be honest with the student body, rather than slurring over important details, fabricating false implications, and attempting to deceive the students.

Letter to the Editor
Editor:Again, the Tartan Editorial staff has failed to look before it leaped.It would greatly benefit The Tartan, Student Senate, and the student body if the editors would try to obtain correct information before they spout their anti-Senate tainted misinformation. The issue I am addressing concerns the proposed new Bylaws of the Student Body of Carnegie Mellon University.Bylaws allow an organization
to exist; they create positions, functions, etc., of a body. The current Constitution granted Senate the sole authority to amend the Constitution; that is precisely what is being done. According to 
Roberts Rules of Order, Newly 
Revisedx as soon as a bylaw amendment is passed, it immediately becomes effective. In the case of the new bylaws, as soon as they are passed they become the new law. These bylaws would then be the rules that grant the presidential veto power. It would be impossible to veto the very rules that grant a power. In addition, the idea of a presidential veto power over something as important as the bylaws is ridiculous. What sort of system would grant one person the power to make a decision concerning something as important as the bylaws over the decision of 34 people?The editors of The Tartan who have attended the meetings of Student Senate seem more concerned with preventing Senate from passing an improved set of governing regulations for the student body than they are concerned with passing false news of gloom and doom. Not one positive point has yet been printed. A great deal

of effort has gone into these bylaws with one purpose and one purpose only: to make the rules more coherent and more uniform.As a final note, this letter originally contained much more substance and considerably more backing for its points.

PRESS PASS
by Paul Platosh
Pulling the 
punch from 
the NHL
The year is 1975. In Philadelphia, the streets are cold and empty, but somewhere, in the distance, faint shouts and cheers float plaintively on the wind to anyone who remains on the deserted streets. The source of the ruckus is the Spectrum, where the whole city came to watch a toothless Bobby Clarke score with i bleeding forehead on a sprawling Ken Dryden.Minutes later, George The Hammer Shultz with his characteristic snarl and sideburns down to his ankles pummels a surly Dave Topachenko into sweet oblivion with his taped fists. This is the era of the Broad Street Bullies, and the ice belonged to Philadelphia.But not always. Beware, because always lurking around the corner was Dave The Tiger Williams from Vancouver, or Terrible Ted Green. The Hammer didnt have an easy job. Sure, beating the brains out of Chicagos Stan Mikita would have been a piece of cake, if only he didnt have to get through Bill The Butcher Butters. And The Butcher had an innovative technique for removing ones block without using anesthetic.This was hockey. The intimidation, the senseless violence, the swollen fists, and bruised faces were a part of the game since its conception. In fact, the first recorded hockey game, in Winnipeg Manitoba, ended in a brawl which the police had to break up. A witness recalled, Players fought and hollered, women swooned, and people fled in general confusion.... What can you do with a sport with such a rich tradition?You let it continue. If people dont like the way the sport is being played, then I tell them not towatch. Though,Iveneverbeen to a hockey game where, during a fight, everyone didnt stand to get a better view, and the level of cheering rose 10 decibels. Lets face it folks, the human race is a violent one.I was watching the Penguins - Senators game the other night, and I saw a healthy Mario Lemiuex carry the puck from the defensive zone, to the offensive al crease, and park it there for more than a minute, with nary a Senators defenseman laying a hand on him. He didnt even get checked. I dont care if he was the Virgin Mary standing on the goal crease. He should have been checked from Ottawa to Kingdom come. That would have never happened in 1975.As Rangers tough guy Tie Domie said, Its already a sissy game ... soon well be skating in skirts. And the new rule changes only make it worse. Players cant touch a guy without being ejected for instigation or some other 
happy horse crap like that.I dont understand this new wave hockey fan. Instead, I cast y weary eyes toward yesteryear, back to the days when the Bobby Orrs, the Phil Espositos, Md the toothless Bobby Clarkes kept us on the edge of our seats, while the Terrible Ted Greens, Hammers, and the Tigers kept Us frightened. Those were real en and that was Old-Time Hockey. Thats the only kind of hockey I know.

Soccer upsets Washington U.
Mens team hopes for first-ever playoff selection with 12-4-1 record
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Staffwriter
As the clock ran out on an October that saw heroes made of unsung players like Francisco Cabrera, Ed Sprague, and Mike Timlin, the Tartan mens soccer team added two more names to that list: junior goalkeeper Dan Warren and junior back Michael Brazinski, who led the Tartans to a 1-0 victory over UAA rival Washington University.
Warren, who a year ago was in the hospital for 20 days after breaking a rib and tearing his spleen in half against Grove City College, replaced injured starter and All-UAAjunior David Shapiro after Shapiro broke a bone in his back on October 23 against Emory University. The talented but inexperienced reserve, whose career was once in doubt, made seven tough saves to record the shutout. Meanwhile,Brazinski, who had not lettered until this season, tallied his sixth goal of the year on a breakaway to provide the margin of victory.I just wanted to make sure we didnt lose because I made a mistake, Warren said. I didnt make any mistakes today, though. Shapiro played well all year, and Ive been waiting around. I got my chance, and Im happy with the way I played. I came back because I just wanted to play, and it turned out well. Its a big turnaround from being in the hospital.He played super for goaltending without any time this year. Thats why you have a good backup. He did a great job, head coach Nick Gaudioso said.Its the best feeling Ive ever had,Brazinski said of his goal. It was great. We all hustled as a team and we knew that we had to win this game, and we all gave it 100 percent.
It was a counterattack, he described. I just hustled up the sideline. I challenged the guy, and he played the ball off me, and I stole it and just sprinted down the line and snuck it past the goalie.CMU and Washington battled back and forth for the entire first half, with both teams having several scorPhll Joyco/Tartan Artist

ing chances, most notably one for CMU about 15 minutes into the game. Brazinski collided with Bears goalie Tim Stewart, but while Stewart lay injured on
the field, the Tartans could not score on the empty net. However, with just under 15 minutes gone in the second half, Brazinski deflected a pass, outsprinted one defender, faked out another, and beat Washington goalie Patric Santo Pietro.After that, the Tartans held the ball and played tough defense throughout the last half-hour of the game, with Warren coming up big time and again, once jumping over a Washington player to make a save, and several times pouncing on the ball in a crowd. Carnegie Mellon also had their chances, but Santo Pietro stopped them several times on breakaways resulting from clearing passes over the Washington defenders.Unfortunately, the Tartans had to wait to find out their fate and see if their playoff dreams became a reality. The playoff invitations were not given out by the NCAA until nine this morning. However, Gaudioso said the odds were in their favor.[Our chances to make the playoffs] are very good. The only tiling the committee can look at is strength of schedule, ho said. "The other team and us both liavo the exact same record [12-41 overall]. Theres no question in my mind wo liavo a stronger schedule, but its how the committee looks at it.Of course, his enthusiasm was tempered by what could liavo boon: If wo hadnt lost an earlier game wo thought wo could have won, wo could havo clinched an automatic bid tonight. This conference [the UAA] has an automatic bid to the tournament.Were playing well, though. Woro doing everything we can do. Were playing at the top of our game, and there arent going to be any teams tougher than the one we played tonight.

Football grinds Grove City
By JOSH LINDER
Tartan Sports Editor
On a day which could be considered as having perfect football weather, the Tartans football team put on a perfect showing of their talent for the Carnegie Mellon parents by defeating the Grove City Wolverines by a score of 35-14.The 48-degree weather did not chill the Tartans, as they finally have shown that they can compete in the first half. The defense did an excellent job in preventing the Grove City Wolverines from gaining a first down until the end of the first quarter, and the offense scored on their first possession a 17-play drive that ate up 10 minutes on the clock. Fred Harding continued to be effective, completing all five of his extra point attempts. The CMU defense came back after the initial touchdown drive to stop the Wolverines again, with sophomore safety Steve Voytovich breaking up a key Grove City pass. He also finished with five unassisted tackles, making the school almost forget about the injured John Fratto.The second quarter opened up much like the first, with the Tartans dominating. Captain Andy Helms intercepted a pass from Grove City quarterback Tom Miles to end the Grove City drive. Only a few seconds later, junior wide reciever Andy Van Sprang caught a 21-yard pass for a touchdown. Grove City quickly recovered from the second CMU score by driving 63 yards to cut the Tartans lead to seven points. The Tartans came back from the score to increase Grove Citys deficit with a 10-yard touchdown run by Ed Ruland, who finished the game with 112 all-purpose yards.The second half didnt begin as promising as the first half, for the Tartans accumulated 33 yards of penalties within two minutes. Grove City capital
ized on CMUs mistakes, with sophomore tight end Andy Sems catching a 30-yard touchdown pass. Andy, the younger of the Sems brothers, finished the game with 53 yards recieving, while his older sibling Rick, the flanker for the Wolverines, finished with 134. The Wolverines would only get within seven points, for the rest of the game was dominated by the mighty Tartans.To start the fourth quarter, the Tartans scored quickly, with sophomore quarterback Chris Dee scoring on an eight yard run. They were pumped up after that, with the defense preventing the Wolverines from scoring. Ben Burtons second sack of Grove Citys Miles put the quarterback in his place, after his post-touchdown antics angered many of the players and fans alike. Jason Grusky, quiet throughout the first three quarters of the game, came on in the fourth period to finish the game with 127 total yards, 115 of those coming on the ground. His efforts earned him the co-Blockbuster Player of the Game Award. The defense prevented Grove City from scoring, sealing the score at 35-14 and giving the Tartans a 5-2 record.The defense had a very good day, with only a few mistakes made. Junior linebacker Chad Wilson had 10 tackles and a key pass breakup. He played his position very well, as he almost intercepted two passes. Senior inside linebacker Jim Cooke had six tackles, but he has given up his kicking career since the Chicago game. Defensive tackle Ben Burton, who was the second Blockbluster Player of the Game, played a superb game, with five tackles and two key sacks, one which prevented Grove City from scoring late in the game.The team finishes its season against Catholic University next week and Case Western on November 14.

Last Tuesday, the volleyball team concluded their successful regular season schedule with a 31 victory over Chatham College. The win improved Carnegie Mellon's record to 1914 while Chatham dropped to 3-12.The match was used by the Tartans to prepare for the UAA Championships, scheduled on October 29-31 at the University of Chicago. Our main goal to
night was to work on our plays and different rotations, and do everything as hard as we could to prepare for the tournament,  said Lisa Leonardo, a 5 ' 10'' senior who dominated play at the net where she recorded 16 kills and assisted on four blocks.Game one, a 15-8 win for Carnegie Mellon, saw them start out strong with a 70 run. Chatham battled back to close within one at 7-6. Carnegie Mellon took control and wrapped it up with the precision serving of sophomore Molly Brennan, who served the last five points of the game.The second game went to Chatham 15-13. Again the Tar
tans got off to the quick start, leading 8-1. A timeout by Chatham helped them to regroup and they rebounded with four straight points. A few minutes later they called a second timeout, after which they ran off five more points to close the gap to 11-10. Both teams traded points and sideouts before Chatham prevailed.The Tartans dominated games three and four, winning both by scores of 15-6 and 15-3 respectively.
When Leonardo was asked to assess the teams performance, she said, I was really happy with how we played today. Transition was good, we worked on our serving. They didnt have any blockers, so we really had no obstacles to go around.The Tartans were led by the setting of senior Lisa Devlin (16 assists) and Brennan (21 assists). Senior Ann Feng led the defense with five digs and also hit three service aces. Senior Elizabeth Rowlands had a strong performance at the net with nine kills and assisted on two blocks, as did senior Heather Thompson, who recorded seven kills and hit two service aces.

14The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  2 November 1992
Soccer ends on positive note, team finishes much improved
By GARY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
The womens Boccer team finished up their season this week with a couple of well-played home games. According to coach Julie Shackford, Im pleased with the season. We anticipated a difficult season, but we have shown a lot of improvement.If Tuesday nights game was pny indication of the level the team has reached, then yes, they have shown a great deal of improvement. The team shutout newcomer Grove City by a score of 2-0. CMU dominated the majority of the game, but couldnt manage to put the ball in the net. fl was pleased with our attack. We got over 30 shots. I just would have liked to get a few more goals, said Shackford.The game opened up surprisingly, as Grove City created a good deal of pressure. They kept driving in, only to bounce off the CMU defense, drawing a few questionable penalties early on. However, after only a few minutes, the tide turned and it became quite obvious who the better team was. CMU managed to control the ball well, but couldnt formulate any mcgor offense. This seemed to show that they were not used to attacking that much.The CMU midfield managed to keep the ball in Grove Citys end for the better portion of the period. At one point, the ball did not
cross half for over 10 minutes, giving goalie Trish Henrich some valuable time to catch up on her studies. When Grove City finally managed to clear the ball, the CMU defense would just calmly take back what waB rightfully theirs and boot it back down the field.The only real excitement of the first half came on a couple of Bhots by junior captain Rachel Bourn. Twice in the half, Bourn collected the ball, turned, and fired shots on goal, only to be eaten up by the goalie. According to Bourn, Overall, we played well and had a lot of good combinations. We could have won by more but we couldnt finish our offensive plays. Well have a great play but we just cant finish. The first half ended 0-0. As Shackford said, We played a little Bloppy the first half. We made a few mistakes.The action did not slow down after the initial goal for quite some time. Aboutl 5 minutes into the half, a shot was fired off the post, commencing an exciting display of confusion. After knocking the ball around for awhile, senior fullback Tracy Howard beat the goalie with a swift shot, but she couldnt beat the backup goalie. Grove City halfback Bridget Patrick assumed the roll of keeper as shp knocked the ball off the goal-line with both hands. A penalty shot was called and Patrick was thrown out of the game. In
the words of the linesman, She played a hell of a game! Senior fullback Sonya Chmielnicki was awarded the penalty shot. The Grove City keeper did her best impression of Lots wife, as she had no reaction to Chmielnickis perfectly placed goal.The rest of the game featured some more exciting action, and plenty of scoring opportunities for the CMU offense. The best opportunity came with about seven minutes remaining. Junior midfielder Jessica Strieker headed the ball over the goalie, only to be broken up once again on the goal-line by the Grove City defense, only this time legally. Jennifer Komon of Grove City made an outstanding save by heading the ball over the crossbar.Despite a furious series of attacks, the game ended 2-0. Overall, Shackford seemed quite pleased with the teams effort. Obviously we dominated the play. It was hard to penetrate because they tightened up on us. All their defenders were hanging around and we just couldnt get it through. She later said, We did have some really good combination play.The Tartans closed their season Saturday night against Washington University. As Shackford said, they wanted to play them the same way as we played Emory: win individual defensive battles and play tight man-toman defense.Shackford was equally satisfied with the teams overall performance this season as she was with their efforts this past week. One of the things that may have hurt the team was having no preseason. While other schools have a couple weeks of training camp, CMU was permitted only one day,
due to the schools early start. Shackford is hoping to have the legislation changed to make it fairer for the team.Bourn shares Shackfords enthusiasm about the season. Our record doesnt really say much. If you ask any of the players, we definitely dont feel like were playing for a losing team. Bourn
feels the team did a good job overall in their first season in their division. We established ourselves as a good team in the UAA We are looking to move up and improve on things next year and to let other teams know that we have a strong program.The women finished up the season with a record of 6-10-1.

Lets go Shannon, I say.
Wait a minute, Paul, for Gods sake thats die tliird time youve rushed me. Cant I 
get a jacket first? Jesus Christ youre impatient."
Ifwe hit traffic, Ill be pissed."
Fine. When Im shivering, youll give me your clothes.
Wc walk over to my '72 Impala, which is parked across the street from Shannons 
apartment building. Even the sunset cant make this town or my c.ir look any better, 
the light cant get dirough the buildings on the horizon. Shannon thinks this place is 
beautiful. She would. I hate the fact that I have to live in her place, even though shes 
my lady. I feel like a kid. (Ever)' time I approach my car, I wish it were a convertible. 
The only tiling I can do is roll down die windows and dream. Shannon always 
complains.) I drive out to 33 and onto die turnpike; Shannons messing with the maps.
Do you know how to get diere, Paul?
"Pick a number between one and ten, I say.
,fWhy? Heres die Jersey map. Wc need Pennsylvania. Do you have one in this mess 
somewhere?
I dont believe in keeping anything clean and she knows that.
"Just pick a number.
Why? You pick a number. Youll never be able to get to your interview tomorrow if wc 
dont find the map.
She loves looking at maps. Makes her feel smart.
Cant you just pick a number? I yell at her. Jesus Christ, Shannon, cant you just do 
what I say? Pick a number!
Whats die matter with you Paul? I just thought it was strange diat you wanted me to 
pick a number for no reason.
Whats die number? I say. Im trying real hard to hold bade I get so frustrated everyday 
with her, like acid burning my chest. Shes great when it comes to being trustworthy and 
honest, but she rarely says anydiing that interests me. Shes convenient.
Ok, seven. Seven has always been lucky for me. I was born on the seventh.
Seven, fine, good.
What do you need a number for?
I dont answer, instead I roll down die window some more.
Im cold.
Theres a jacket in die back.1 dont see why you have to have the window down all the time, diis heap will never be a 
convertible.
I pull out a cigarette. There she goes, destroying my vision again. I can see the open 
road, and me in a convertible, just flying. She brings me back down, always.
And I certainly dont see why you have to smoke in the car.
What arc you my modier? Shut up already, will you please?
What die hells the matter widi you, Paul?
Look Im not dirillcd about going to your mothers okay? Ive had a long day. Just go to 
sleep. Its true I had a long day, but mosdy I dreaded riding in the car with her, and 
going to her mothers.
I hope youre not like this when wc get to my mother s. I dont know why you two cant 
just
Shannon, I whisper to her, Just shut up, please? Just shut the fuck up.
I drive for an hour to get to Pennsylvania, over the Scudder Falls bridge and up Route 
Nine on the riverside. I hate long, long Pennsylvania, but Im having a good dream 
now. I once drove from Harrisburg back to New Jersey and I thought about blowing
Volumeolu
my brains out when I got home. Home never got any closer, and by the time I got 
there, I fell asleep at the wheel right after I parked in front of the apartment.
Sometimes Im awake but I feel like Im sleeping and dreaming while Irn on the road,- 
especially on fast highways in die dark.
Shannon sleeps while I grumble to myself about her. I want her and then I dont want 
her. She wants me, diough Ive never been able to figure out why. I dont want her 
family or friends. Theyre a waste of time. Most of all I dont want her mother. All 
week Ive been dreaming of diat impossible ditch on the side of the road. Its a 
recurring theme in my dreams. Every time I try to back out, my car falls deeper.
Finally, I turn off Nine toward Shannons mothers house.
I pull up the driveway and park die car. I give Shannon a shake.
Wake up, were here.
She doesnt wake. I give her a pinch on the thigh, open the door and get out.
Owwww! Damn you. I can see her glaring at me and sharpening her eyes.

---------------------------------------------------

The worst thing, the worst thing in the world, would be for her to go to sleep and 
leave me with Linda. Ive devised some escape plans in my head. Wc walk up the path 
to the door. Shannons mother comes before wc get in. And there she is, raging 
beauty, and I cant look her in the face. I get flashes of shame and desire.
Hello Paul, I see you made it safe and sound for once.
Hi, Linda, nice to see you, too.
Not a one or two for the road I hope?
Mother, Shannon breaks in.
Oh, he knows Im just needling him a little, right, Paul?
Whatever. I say.
I notice right then how much Shannon looks like her mother. Maybe thats why I stay 
with her. A substitute. But the similarity is only physical. Shannons mother is 
strong, and only forty-one to Shannons twenty-five. She had been doing aerobics that 
time when I came over and Shannon was out shopping. Ill admit that she was beyond 
beautiful, and I screamed at myself in my head. She wore a tight body suit, and the 
sweat beaded from her tight muscles. The light was behind her and it shown through 
her blond her and it wisped in her face. She was a goddess. I couldnt help it. Really.
She could have helped it but she had that grip around my arm and I couldnt shake it. I 
remember what she whispered in my car as I got up from the bed, feeling sick;
Is this what you do to Shannon? Lucky girl.
It was too good.
Shannon goes straight up to the bathroom so Im left sitting with her in the living room. I 
know shes just staring me down, I can feel it on the back of my neck. Im one of those 
people who always leaves a silent room, especially when the other person makes me sweat. 
What am I supposed to say? It1 s been about a year and a half. Am I supposed to just sit 
and talk now?...Howya doin?...What are you working on?...Do you want to fuck?
Paul, Im going to tell her. I cant keep it inside anymore, she says.
I stare at her for awhile thinking I want to kill her and that I love her. I know shes serious 
and not playing games. Shes going to ruin my whole scene, and Im going to pick up and 
start all over again. I guess that wouldnt be so bad.
Tell Shannon I went for cigarettes, I say.
1 have some Marlboros in the kitchen.
I need Parliaments.
Im out the door before she can say anything. I have that feeling in my gut, like 
something is trying to punch its way out. I want to vomit. Sometimes I lay in bed 
while Shannons asleep and I get myself worked up. I go in the bathroom and hang 
over the toilet until something comes up.
I get on the road and blow by the 7-11 on the corner.o-^o-o
Seven, I say, sevens all the way down.
My window is all the way down now, and the air is getting chill and nothing is getting 
closer. But nothing is stopping me. I look at the maps left on the front seat. One 
reads, Eastern United States. I take all of them and tlirow them out the window.
Maps arc just a trap to keep you in the country and within boundary lines. My life is a 
trap. I told this to Shannon and she told me I was paranoid with a big P. The tank is 
full and I have all the time that would ever be in front of me.
My old man once said, As long as you have gas in the car, youre never lost.
Exit Seven creeps up. Ive been thinking about it since I saw the sign for Exit Six, on 
the bottom it read, Next Exit: 47 Miles. I am within two now. I hate how they put 
signs up for the exit every half mile, from five miles away. It makes the last stretch an 
eternity. It measures it. I hate all the signs that tell me how far because I always think I 
am getting closer than I really am. I never seem to get closer to where I really want to 
go. I dont have a clock in the car, and I am bad at estimating how long I have been 
driving. The signs seem to say, Wrong again, Jack
I break off the turnpike at Exit Seven, and after I pay the toll, Im headed toward 
Washington. I wish J, didnt see the signs. I have the nasty realization that after the 
hundred dollars I cashed from my paycheck is gone, Im scrapped.
Now I need a credit card, I laugh.
I dont believe in credit. I think Id run into too much trouble with it. Buying drinks 
and such. I remember Shannons gas card though. I have it in my wallet. She gave it to 
me after she wrecked her car, but I never use it.
Shit, why did I remember that? I thought.
Now Shannon is in my mind. I was able to keep from thinking about whats going on 
back at Lindas. All the while Id been making plans for myself: to ditch the car and 
hitchhike to Mexico. To get to Seattle and start my own garage. So much had come to 
be while I waited for Seven to come along. Dreams of becoming my own man, dreams 
of meeting pretty girls in Texas, and them digging me. Shannon comes into my mind 
and its like shes a character on a movie screen. Shes only two-dimensional to me, as if 
she completely didnt matter if I cant feel her. Just a side show.
I dont need her anyway, I try to convince myself.
I know that is wrong. I imagine myself the tough guy, just leaving town, going my own 
way. I imagine not needing anybody and how easy that would be. But when youre 
alone there arent enough distractions from yourself and Ill get those feelings in my 
stomach all over again. I should have stuck it out and been a man. My old man might 
have done that; he was a man. But he got into an accident they said and left us, done. 
God knows where I am now. Maybe that ditch on the side of the road.
PENNSYLVANIADoug Smith
Lucky Sevens
The turnpike is only a couple of miles north on Nine. I speed the whole way. After I 
get the ticket, there it is in front of me, long, long Pennsylvania, measured by exits on 
the highway. Thats the only way you can get off. I bet if I keep on driving Ill keep 
going and there will be more exits and Ill never get out of Pennsylvania. Each exit is a 
possible world.
I exit on the next Seven, and the next Seven, and I'm getting sucked down into the 
arterial catacomb of roads. Like a moth on a spider web, connected to everything, but 
cant get anywhere. I know Ill be on the map somewhere, but maybe I can find a 
place far enough away so Ill never be found. The gas is running low, and I pull out 
the Mobil card, hoping to see a station soon.oo
I turn toward the Harrisburg and West ramp, and speed onto the straightaway going 
on and on. Night has come down heavily, there are no lights on the road. The 
arching trees make the highway seem like a tunnel to me now, sloping downward, 
pushing me toward the void miles below. I dont mind that so much as I cant see 
through to the end of it. I dont know where Im going.

. She was quiet. Frank was-afraid hd #  
sounded like he was trying to get her irf bed. Inhis mind he repeated the words he'd said to her 
to judge how they sounded: "I think we may 
have to stay at Guy's tonight..."
But the thought of them sleeping in Guy's 
living room excited him. He wasn't so old, and 
he was still thin. His face was long and strangelooking, but not actually ugly. Perhaps she 
would feel grateful to him for rescuing her car.
He imagined her asleep on the sofa.
"We don't have to stay there," he said 
against his better judgment. "I mean, if you 
really need to get home. I'm just afraid I'll fall 
asleep at the wheel, that's all."
She said nothing for a moment. "No, I 
guess it's okay."
Frank felt a tremor of adrenaline. Did that 
mean she wanted to sleep at Guy's? He had 
offered her a way out, and she didn't take it.
Maybe she was only worried about him 
crashing the car. Still, she would sleep there.
Suddenly he asked himself: could she be 
afraid of him? A pang of fear struck him. He 
hadn't meant to scare her. What was he 
thinking, dragging her upstate to sleep at a 
stranger's house?
Perhaps she wasn't scared. She had agreed 
to go along, after all.
He yawned and behind him he heard Mona 
lightly snoring. He wrestled with the possible 
consequences for the rest of the drive home.
At quarter to one the VW bug pulled into 
Guy's driveway in Blandburg. Guy got out of 
the car, opened the garage door and pulled the 
tarp off of Frank's red Ford pickup. Frank hadn't

_ Mona jerked awake and 
gasped.  \ 
"Why don't you cutthat out,"
Frank said.
"What?" Guy said with his palms up.
"Get your bag, Mona," Frank said.
"You two have a safe ride, okay?" Guy 
said, pulling out his keys.
"I thought you said we could stay here," 
Frank said.
"You kidding? Bertha'd have a cow if I let 
you and her sleep here."
"God damn it, Guyl I'm exhausted!"
"What? It's a two hour drive. Big shit."
Frank looked back at Mona. She walked up 
the driveway towards the truck.
"God damn it."
"What do you want me to tell you? Drive 
her to her car. Hell," Guy said quietly, "I figured 
you'd want to drive her."
"Shut up," Frank said. Frank pulled his 
keys from his pocket. "Thanks for keeping my 
truck."
"Yeah." Guy unlocked the front door and 
went inside.
Frank walked up to the garage and opened 
the door for Mona, then got inside and warmed 
up the engine. He pulled out of the garage and 
stopped. Frank opened the door, hesitated, 
then slammed it again.
"He can close his own God damn garage 
door," he said and pulled out into the street.
Frank drove out of Blandburg and headed 
north towards Scranton. Mona dozed again and 
he envied her. A half an hour later, still 
sleeping, she slid down the seat and leaned 
against his shoulder. When he passed a car,
Frank was careful to keep his right arm still, 
turning the wheel with his left hand while 
letting it slide through his right.
Strangely, he discovered a bar right on the 
highway. In the middle of a forest of black 
trees, the bar's neon sign glowed: "Chip's." 
Impulsively, Frank turned into the parking lot.
"Mona," he said softly. She didn't respond. 
He shook her knee and she jumped awake, 
pulling back against the passenger door.
"What are you doing?" she asked.
"Nothing! I just wanted to see if you 
wanted to get a beer."
"A beer? Right now?"
"Yeah, well, you know. Just a beer." He 
glanced at the bar. Three or four cars were 
parked in the lot. "I think it's going to be closing 
time pretty soon."
"No, that's okay."
"Sure? I'll buy."
"No. Thanks."
Frank nodded and got out of the truck. He 
didn't have much desire for a beer if she wasn't 
coming along, but now he was obligated.
He walked into Chip's and ordered a beer at 
the bar. There were two men at the bar and one 
at a table, but the place was small, so it looked 
half full. He hoped that if he stayed there long 
enough, Mona would get bored and come 
inside.
As he finished his beer, he felt guilty for 
leaving her alone in the truck. Maybe she was

She opened the flap and brought out the 
menu. Frank glanced at it. It was cheap papercoated plastic, like any diner menu, but it was 
in French. Mona slowly scanned the pages. The 
menu suddenly seemed exotic to Frank.
"Anyway, I got back about two weeks ago."
"Really?" Mona asked. "God, I've never 
been anywhere. How long were you there for?"
"Six months. I stayed with a friend of 
Susan's."
"Wow," she said. "I've never been 
anywhere."
Frank felt like he'd lived a thousand years 
longer than Mona. He was wise, experienced, 
and weary.
"I'm tired," he said. "That beer's putting 
me to sleep."
"You going to be okay?"
"Yeah. It should only be another half hour."
They reached route 81 and followed it to 
the exit Mona had taken. A mile from the 
highway they found the supermarket. The 
store's lights were all out and the parking lot 
was clear except for Mona's green Dart.
"Oh thank God," she said. "I was afraid 
they'd tow it or something."
Frank could barely keep his eyes open. He 
parked beside the Dart.
"I need to sleep," he said. "I'm sorry. I'm 
going to have to sleep first."
Mona looked alarmed. She pointed out the 
windshield at her car and said, "But it's right 
here! Can't you just fix it first so I can go 
home?"
Frank shook his head. He probably could.
h.er .
pleadings were 
waking him up, but he 
wanted to sleep beside her 
and he hoped she would at least nap 
in the passenger seat.
His wrist watch read eleven o'clock when 
he woke up. The supermarket parking lot was 
full of cars. Mona was not in the truck. Frank 
was seized by the fear that she had left while he 
was sleeping, but her car was still parked next 
to his. She was sitting on the hood.
Frank got out of the truck and said, "Good 
morning!" Mona had dark circles under her 
eyes.
"Didn't you sleep?" he asked.
She shook her head. He was crestfallen.
She had been too scared of what he might do 
to her in the night. He was an old man to her, 
and he felt humiliated.
"Get up," he said. "I have to check under 
the hood."
Mona moved to the driver's side and 
watched him. He nodded and said, "It's the fan 
belt all right. There might be a gas station 
around here somewhere."
"No, wait," she said, and ran around to the 
trunk. She pulled out a package of three fan 
belts. "Are these them?"
Frank blinked. "You already have some?"
She handed him the belts. "I guess. I don't 
know howto put them on. My dad puts all this 
stuff in the trunk. He's a mechanic."
In fifteen minutes, Frank had replaced the 
fan belt. Mona started the car and it gave a 
healthy growl.
"Oh, thank God!" she shouted. She let the
car run in park and got out to shake F rank's 
hand.
"Thank you so much. I don't think I would 
have gotten the car back if it wasn't for you."
Frank shrugged. "No big deal."
Mona reached into her car and took a pen 
and an old paycheck envelope. "Here's my 
address in New York," she said. "If you're ever 
there and you need a place to stay, you can find 
me."
She shook his hand again. "Thank you so, 
so much." She got back in her car and backed 
out of the space. She waved to Frank, and he 
raised his hand. She pulled out of the parking 
lot and turned right towards the highway.
Frank sat in his truck and looked at the 
address on the envelope. She lived in Ozone 
Park, in Queens. He thought of following her 
there and winced.
On the passenger seat was the Paris 
postcard. He picked it up and wrote:
Dear Mona.
I thought you'd like this postcard. I hope 
you got back to Now York okay. I think I 
will go hack to Paris soon. Maybe if 
your car breaks down again I'll come 
and rescue you.
Love,

Wrong Cha nnels
Sleeping in the car aint no fun. Ive been doing it night on night for awhile. I cant 
decide what to do. Im in Nebraska from exiting at Sevens and I think I might end up 
crawling. Im starting to tliink that I might be making a huge circle and Im gonna end 
up back at Lindas doorstep somehow.
I might set a real course, to get Linda off my mind. I keep remembering how Shannon 
asked me about the scratches on my back. They were Lindas. I made up a story.
I continue on my course and I'm sixty-five miles out of Lincoln, and there the road stops 
leading me downward. Nothing to do here but think. Even if I wanted to drive off a 
cliff, I couldnt. I couldnt even run into a building. I'd pull off into some field and just 
keep on going.
I can see Lincoln in the distance, and I try to imagine what will happen when I get there. 
Maybe I would get a job and everything would be okay. Maybe Id meet somebody 
connected and set myself up in Mexico, on the shore, run a fishing boat, sell hats on the 
beach. Or maybe I could find someone to trust, or a friend like I used to have. That 
wouldnt be so bad.
The radio is the white noise I need to keep my head on, but now it seems to filter out of 
the background. I don't know the station so I listen for the song. The jockey comes on 
and says Here's one from Smokcy Robinson and the Miracles on Oldies Ninety-Eight," 
May-be you wanna give me kiss-es sweet.
Perfect. I dig Motown. Fitting song.
Ooh, if youfeel like giv-ing me, a life-time ofde-vo-tion, I second that e-mo-tion.
You got it wrong, Smokcy, I say, Nothing, is ever gonna make me stay.
I flip through the static until voices come up. Commercials. Lincoln still in the distance, 
nobody on the road. The voices cloud my head enough so I dont have to think. But then 
I cant stand being told where to go on the weekend, where to buy things, and what beer 
to drink anymore, so I flip the dial.
Welcome to the gospel hour. Tonights question comes from the Book of Job: Why 
do good people suffer in a just universe?
Gospel wont do cither. Ive given up on that. Besides God probably isnt too happy 
with me. I find a frequency with a good dear static signal and leave it there as I 
survey the blackness all around.
Sundown Motel, Lincoln
I find the cheapest motel I can find on the outskirts of town, and Im happy not to be 
sleeping in the car. I might even come to call this place home. The Sundown Motel 
was off the highway on the way into Lincoln, and I didnt see anything of the sort as I 
cruised into town, so I turned around and came back. The neon sign that says Vacancy' 
in the window throws flickering reds into the otherwise dizzying space 
above and it lights my way to the door. I look up at the sky in Nebraska and I want 
to fall down.
I open the door and ring the bell at the desk. Nobody appears for awhile and Im 
getting impatient. Finally a man in a white tank top comes out of a door behind the 
desk. His glasses are thick and black, which matches the color of his unruly hair and 
mustache. This man is pale white, a ghost, with hair stretching up his arms from 
around liis armpit, and flowing from back to front.
Just one? he asks. A mouth has appeared just under the bristles of his mustache.
Yes."
Strange."
Do you have a room?
Hourly or daily rate?
Daily.
Hmmin The man turns around and studies the cubby holes along the wall. Yeah, 
14B around the corner.
He holds up the key. I go to take it.
Twenty bucks. And sign this release form."
I might be staying more that one day."
Dont matter. Pay as you go. Sign the form.
It absolves the motel and the owner of all liability for occurrences on motel grounds 
and holds guests responsible for damages. I sign it, wondering what would be the 
occurrences on motel grounds." I take the key from the man.
"Bar across the streets open till two. You still got a few hours to grab a drink. And 
from the looks of you, you need one. The man turns toward the door. Night pal.
I drive around to my room and the minute I get in the door, I flop down on the bed.
I stare up at the cracks in the ceiling and Im able to see animals and faces that the 
cracks make. I notice every detail about the spindly lines that run across the plaster.
I focus my attention on one crack and see nothing else. I follow the line of the crack 
all across the ceiling, past the water stains, down the corner and the side wall, and it 
disappears somewhere behind the mirror that I find myself looking into.
I sec my face in the mirror and say Who arc you and what arc you doing here?
This might be the land of what am I doing here?"
I grew haggard from the trip, not enough to eat, not enough sleep, endless driving. I 
cant prevent the word older" from entering my mind. I know Im not a kid. The 
mirror reflects a man back at me, a resdess one that might die real young and Im not 
digging that feeling.
I fool myself into believing I have the energy to get up and go out. I pretend to brush 
my hair and tidy myself up by splashing some cold water on my face. I check out my 
wallet and see the dwindling bills, a twenty and some ones, but I bolt out the door 
anyway and head toward the bar.
Another Turn
She is sitting across the bar and I cant help looking at her. My eyes are tired and I 
cant see her that well, but I know she is beautiful. I keep swilling beer, but Im 
trying to make it last. She hasnt looked at me yet, at least I dont think so. What 
could I say? Im not ready for this. But maybe, as I sharpen my eyes to see the lines 
in her face, shes seen some of what I have. Her brown hair is straight and long. It 
probably reaches all the way down her back but I cant see from where Im sitting.
The bartender puts a drink in front of me and says A whiskey from the lady on the 
comer down there." He passes me a note written on a napkin: Tve been on the road 
too, Jersey Boy.
My plates. That feeling in my stomach returns. I go over.
Lets go." I say.
Maybe this is the possible world thats possible for me. Get on the road and just keep 
going. All the answers are down the line. We get into my car and hit the highway, 
windows down.

to the Future
kar*neg*e

---------------------------------------------------

editor's first words:
I have to admit, I once called the Jean Dixon psychic hotline to find out what the future held for me. I got the 
same answer every sucker who spends a buck forty-five a minute found out  I will experience great love (dealing 
with 1,000 pick up lines a night at single bars), I will be praised for my work (my mother will stop calling my position 
"middle management"), and I will straighten out all my financial problems (collection agencies will lose my home 
address). Face it, sometimes it's not worth even being a little curious about these things.
The moral of the story is don't search blindly for information about the future . Look at what is unfolding 
around you  not at the heading "psychics" in your local yellow pages. Science and technology have progressed be
yond the conventional microwave. Genetic diseases may soon be eradicated, artificial limbs and organs will enable the 
handicapped to finally lead active lives, computers will make our lives even more efficient, and who knows  we may 
finally make contact with "other beings" (although some have already claimed to).
The heart of the future lies at CMU. With its advanced art, science, and technology programs, our University is 
sure to be the best contender as we race towards the known and the unknown. The students that come through this 
"learning mill" will someday build the brave new world and in so doing will contribute to the nature of education at 
this school. This is one prediction Jean Dixon has no ability to make....

---------------------------------------------------

Two years ago at Homecoming, I interviewed Norma Shea Langworthy, a woman who graduated from CMUs 
Drama Department in 1940. She told me how things had changed from 1940 to 1990  how there were no graduate 
programs at all; how scandalous it was that she had spent 15 minutes in the "boys'" dorm; and how the craziest thing 
anyone ever did, even those kooky CFA students, was smoking a cigarette or having a beer.
Hopefully, when I return to CMU in 2042, and a nice little freshman woman interviews me for The Tartan, she 
and I will be able to see similar change in other areas. Hopefully, when I tell her about the military's discrimination 
against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, and about the person who painted "gas the queers" on the Fence, she'll be ap
palled. No, I take that back. I hope she laughs, because in her day, fighting over sexual orientation will be laughable, as 
will obsessing about differences in gender, race, religion, and all sorts of other stuff.
And, hopefully, that will be the end of that discussion and we can move on to other, more fun things. Like rock 
and roll. I'll have to tell her about Nirvana, of course, how they paved the way for all of my favorite music to hit the 
airwaves. I'll tell her what a pain it was to have twelve-year-olds liking my favorite bands, but how it was kind of cool, 
too. I'll tell her about MTV back when they still played videos at least some of the time, and I'll explain to her the idea 
of moshing, which she'll either think is extremely odd, or laughably tame, depending on the specific directions music 
ends up moving in.
I'll tell her about the return of the '60s, and she'll laugh when I say, "Yes, I really did wear flannel shirts and big 
black shoes, and some of my friends had pink hair." We'll sit in the newly-completed University Center (of course, I'll 
tell her the stories about that), and she'll ask me what we did for fun. So I'll tell her about fraternity parties and PHI 
and Super Saver movies, and she'll agree with me that, really, there is nothing to do in Pittsburgh.
I'll tell her how we all hated Wean, Hunt Library, and Donner because we thought they were ugly and datedlooking, and she'll tell me that she and her friends feel the same way about Resnik, the West Wing, and the GSIA 
building. She'll think that the way we do buggy was really strange, because they'll have devised some ingenious 
method of doing it, probably involving laser beams or superconductors. I'll tell her that we did, in fact, carry paper 
and actual books, and how, though everyone did a lot of stuff on computers, my friends and I made fun of the kid 
who took his freshman psychology notes on a laptop.
I'll tell her about the male-female ratio, I'll describe the Yard's nachos and blender drinks, I'll talk forever about 
how much fun my friends and I had living in Donner freshman and sophomore years (honest). She'll tell me about 
her parties and hanging out with her friends and how they all order out for flavored seaweed chips and drink carbohy
drate-enhanced coffee when they have to stay up all night.
It will be cool to talk to my twenty-first century counterpart. Of course she won't be able to understand every
thing that I try to explain, and I'm sure that by the time I'm 69,1 won't understand why the kids insist on wearing 
those totally impractical buckets as hats and going around saying that they just can't dance to the Red Hot Chili Pep
pers' music. But I have no doubt that we will connect. No matter how big the generation gap seems, people mostly go 
through the same things  people always fight with their parents, fall in love with great books, and change their 
minds.
Sure, things are always going to change, but probably not as much as we expect.

By JAMES ALTUCHS
Research Fellow lor StutBo ol Creative Inquiry
We want a new drug. A drug that allows us to breathe life into our daydreams. We want to be able to fly and go 
against the laws of physics without recrimination. Technology whispers to us that anything and everything is possible. 
My dream is this: to live inside a virtual reality (VR) which constantly changes according to my needs and desires 
while my "real" body is fed, supported intravenously for years, and then eventually withers away inside some VR 
chamber in the so-called real world. This reality must be so strong, so engaging, that I must never miss the paltry 
reality which I lived in prior to entering the VR chamber.
Wait a second, you might say. That's sick. And maybe it scares you that someone might think this way. Maybe 
you might think I'm kidding. OK hotshot, you say, go ahead and do it. Live inside a VR chamber for the rest of your 
life.
Only thing is, I know that there is no way for me to do this anytime soon. Despite the predictions of movies like 
Lawnmower Matt and Total Recall, the science of virtual reality is still a long way off from providing people with fully 
interactive, immersive experiences. There are several reasons for this. First of all, what makes you think that the world 
you inhabit is real?
For starters, the five senses play a strong role. Vision, combined with an inuitive understanding of the physics 
that works around us, provides us with important clues that the world we see around us is, in fact, the real world. For 
the reality detective - touch, hearing, smell, and even taste, also provide us with tools to test out any reality which is 
only posing as our reality or even a distant cousin of our reality.
From a purely simulation point of view then, a VR system must incorporate some knowledge of how the 
senses are transmitted through the body and how to best recreate those transmissions through technological 
means. Current VR systems (for instance, the Virtuality game which passed through Pittsburgh a few 
months ago), simulate 3-D vision by letting the user wear a helmet with two TV screens attached near the

---------------------------------------------------

eyes. A sensor above the user's head determines which direction the user is looking and a computer calculates the 
image that should appear on each screen. The simple turn of a head could potentially require millions or even billions 
of calculations for the computer to determine the new images that should be displayed on the TV screens. Fine. Com
puters are fast and they are getting faster. Current VR systems have very slow graphics when compared with the speed 
by which humans process the visual information around them. However, with computers doubling in speed every year 
it remains conceivable that computers can catch up to us before long.
Things become more difficult, however, when you want to actually put things inside your world. For instance, 
a human body. The movement of a human body is a very difficult object to model, what with our hundreds of bones, 
muscles, tissues, etc. all interconnecting and moving simulataneously throughout the world. VR systems currently give 
the user a fake body, one with only a few joints, if any, that make it easier to model. Again, though, over the years, as 
computers become faster and graphics systems become more sophisticated, it will become increasingly possible to 
model the body and all of its components as well as other objects that are just as difficult to currently model.
Since vision has proved to be such a difficult sense to implement, the other four senses have been pretty much 
ignored by VR designers. Smell and sound may not be so difficult. By maintaining a huge library of smells and sounds 
inside the VR system and releasing them according to the virtual environment the user finds himself in, a VR system 
may be able to simulate these senses. But the other two senses remain a problem. How do you simulate the senses of 
touch or taste? First we would need an exact understanding of what electrical signals pass along the nerves from our 
fingertips to our brain and from our taste buds to our brain. Then we Would need to implement this inside the com
puter.
Still, though, as computers get more powereful I expect that these problems will perhaps become more readily 
solved. So should I be making my last good-byes and getting ready to enter a VR tank and enter the worlds of virtual 
reality forever? Not so fast. Suppose I arrive in a visually amazing VR world, filled with smells, feelings, sounds, and 
sights that I have never experienced before. There's one more thing that I would like and that's virtual companion
ship. Where are the people in this VR world?
Here is where the study of artificial intelligence steps in. Artificial intelligence (AI), pioneered by two CMU 
professors, Herb Simon, and the recently deceased Allen Newell, as well as MIT professor Marvin Minsky, is the study 
of how we can simulate human behavior and human thought processes inside the computer. Forty years ago, the 
mathematician Alan Turing posed a simple test for future AI researchers. Sit in one room and type questions into a 
console. In another room is either a human or a computer typing back answers to your questions. If you cannot tell if 
the respondent is a computer or a human and if the respondent is, in fact, a computer, then that computer has passed 
the Turing test.The Turing test has never been passed with any degree of success but VR poses us a much more complicated 
Turing test. Right now let's make a little list. Imagine all of the abilities a computer-simulated human should have in 
order for it to fake you out arfd convince you that it is real. Here are some of the things that AI programs cannot do 
with sufficient regularity although they have made great gains in the past twenty years. Recognize your image, under
stand your voice, understand the meanings behind a short story or a poem, laugh at a good joke, or cry when hearing 
a tragic story. And these things would be just the basics of creating a simulated and believable VR citizen. This is not a 
criticism of AI and again, there are AI programs out there that are doing amazing things. However, in order for me to 
agree to spend the rest of my life in a VR chamber there has to be some pretty significant successes in this field and I 
feel this is where potential VR researchers should be spending their time. If for no other reason 
than to provide me with a new drug.

Writer's note: I thought that a short story would be better than a grim tech report in predicting how the field of robotics will affect CMU in the fiiture (Ha! The editors o/'Karnege didn't know that I was also an English major and have long had lame and unfulfilled 
pretensions towards literary creativity). Below is a short visit into the slightly unfamiliar life of an atypical CMU student in the year 2042.
The middle of April was Ernie Jones' favorite time of the spring semester. It's not that he suffered from seasonal depression, because winter didn't depress him, but the fresh air that April brought always made him a little bit more extroverted and considerably more annoying to those around him who were trying to get some serious work done.
"She's lucky I'm coming to class at all," said Ernie to nobody in particular, "on such a beautiful day as this."
The lanky would-be sculptor cut across the grass in front of the student center and managed, for the first time in a 
week, to get sprayed by organic fall-out from the slightly under-engineered and unfortunately named "Lawn 
Supervisor Drones," more affectionately known as LSD's. The designers of the glorified lawn-mowers had gone so 
far as to keep the robots from mowing people instead of the lawn, but in a typically myopic manner, had neglected 
to consider that most college students, while hardly fashion superstars, resented wearing the local vegetation to class. 
Ernie truly wanted to believe that this flaw of the LSD's wasn't intentional, but he still couldn't decide if that would 
make him feel better.
Brushing off the last of the lawn trimmings from his black silk shirt, Ernie crossed Forbes Bikeway to the Old Campus, 
and wound his way towards the College of Fine Arts. He briefly chastised himself for stopping to watch a game of 
pick-up basketball in the courts next to the gym and proceeded into the building.
"Mr. Jones, how nice of you to join us!"
Ernie shrugged, smiled innocently, slumped into a chair, and hoped to hell he wasn't blushing. The worst thing one 
could do when one was 15 minutes late for one of Dr. Magnuson's classes, was to make it looked as if you were 
sheepish. If acted out correctly, the one act play in which neither party acknowledges the faux pas could be quite 
educational. A real creative exercise. The lines were the same every time, but the performances varied.
"Yeah, well, I don't really have any more pressing appointments for a bit," he projected while casually glancing at 
his watch with a slight from.

I "Good." stated Dr. Magnuson, "Then, of course you'll have all the time you need for presenting your latest work."

ay, Ejlus it wefi already being fabricated in the stereo! sjie would be not even a little bit amused. Most of 
embarrassed to present them now.
Fuck. That wasn't in the script. Several people in the class giggled at his momentary blank stare. He fidgetecl once in 
the chair, nervously touched the wristwatch-sized cyberlink on his right arm, mentally called up the virtual room 
containing his latest sculptures, sighed at the vastly unfinished state of all of them, straightened up, and sail-, "Sure," 
in the course of approximately half a second.
Dr. Magnuson half-nodded and smiled as she gestured for the young man to take the floor. His classmate 
of Ernie's penchant for rather large holos, pushed their chairs back towards the edge of the large circular
Ernie cleared his throat. Ernie stood up. Ernie nervously adjusted his collar. But mostly, Ernie wished he colild find 
one of his works that he could present and that his BS was strong enough to overcome his stupidity at forgettii g about 
the presentation.
To stall for time, he concentrated on his cyberlink and accessed the classroom control to dim the lights. Tfien he 
summoned three CAR's (Classroom Aid Robots) to move the professor's desk and one of the chairs. Physical 
manipulation was a great time-eater.
"We're waiting, Mr. Jones." spoke the sculpture professor.
Damn. She knows my tricks too well. What to show? The "Ode to Internal Combustion" piece was awaiting CAD Specs
S . v,jp } ..V j*from his friend Mark in civil engineering. He hardly wanted to present the work as-is with hismind's-eye sketch of 
his Grandfather's old sports car. Ernie just didn't want to be mistaken for a cybist. f
"The Last War" was a powerful piece, he thought, with a bit of self praise, but not especially topical, btofiody had 
been interested in this genre for a generation. He wasnt sure he could talk that pnejhto the assignment, "A Look 
Inside" especially on such a beautiful day when conflict was the last thing fqjffnd.
The sudden laughter of the class drew Ernest from his reverie, and/] 
accidentally summoned a holo of the lawn outside. Even Dr. Magnu:

Then his mind performed a small quantum leap as his internal agent suggested the one work he wouldn't have 
considered on his own. The agent, working via the cyberlink, had merely associated attributes of the various requests 
he was making of the sculpture curator system, and had offered up this one piece on a list of suggestions.
He smiled mightily. He activated the room's own curating intelligent agent, who appeared in the holo as a well 
dressed, aged British man.
"Please activate the manual, real-time holo-servo system." Ernie said as the class looked on in slight confusion 
"As you wish sir," spoke the kindly voice, and within a heartbeat, Ernie felt the power in his arm surge.

---------------------------------------------------

When Ernest was much younger he had considered having been born without a left arm to be a curse. Inevitably, 
other children would be childish (hence the etymology) and cruel, and he had sunk down often into pointless selfpity. Moreover, he had frequently resented his parents for it.
But as he grew up, he first learned to live with his one arm and to forgive his parents for what was in no way 
preventable. Then, miraculously, upon finishing his physical growth Ernest had been a recipient of one of the most 
advanced synthetic limbs available. After coming to grips with just one arm, having two was like waking up with 
every day being Christmas.
The most use he got out of the synthetic, though, was in his sculpture. He had become involved in sculpture, as he 
now believed, as an act of rebellion against a universe which had told him, "No." This was dumb in a sense, because 
the universe just sat there passively and happily while he got himself all worked up about it, but in a larger sense, 
that's what being young is often about, or so Ernie said late at night when trying to explain to his friends - and 
occasional non-friends  why he did what he did (while they sat around pretending to be more interested in what 
he was saying than in getting some sleep).
"This piece is for a friend of mine," said Ernest as he summoned what appeared to be a solid block of marble 2 meters 
high and 1 by 1 meter wide. The class took some interest at the serious tone of his voice.
Ernest then walked into the holo, and held out his arm so that only the tip of the synthetic limb emerged from the 
block. With the computers constantly reading the kinematics and dynamics of the arm via the cyberlink, Ernest 
began to strip away the outer layer of the block. Of course, he could never control his arm with enough precision 
or resolution to sculpt "real-time," but his arm directed the computers in their revealing of the next layer of the stored 
piece. He felt as if he were conducting a symphony, and decided to summon some quietly powerful background 
music.
The surrounding room was immersed in black, and Ernie moved his hand in a series of helical motions from top to 
bottom, to reveal a sculpture of his friend, Zita, whom he had met in the Robotics Engineering Department while 
having his cyberlink upgraded.
The realist nature of this layer distracted some of the class members, and a few shuffled uneasily because they felt 
let down, but Ernest merely held up his hand to say, "Wait!" and slowly his programmed sculpting began, and Zita's 
image began to sparkle and dissolve, and the virtual mass of her body swirled and reformed in a holo of himself as 
a boy.
The boy, without changing repose, grew in size and aged, and then sparkled and dissolved into swirling clouds which 
chased each other around in the same helical motion his hand had traced earlier.
The masses separated into two larger clouds, which chased each other in an endless circle, and, echoing the Grecian 
Urn, assumed the forms of a man and woman with hands twice on opposite sides of the circle, and the chase slowed 
as the background music assumed lower harmonics, until just he & Zita were standing, both hands linked in a circle. 
Then the whole scene dissolved into a burst of sparkles and stars, with just a brief hint of some words suspended in 
the air, before the whole illusion faded, and just Ernest stood in the middle of the empty room.
The class stood to applaud, Dr. Magnuson nodded and smiled briefly, and Ernest sat down quite happy with himself.
He just hoped that nobody had read the words that had appeared in the air just before he cut off the performance, 
because he felt that the show would have lost its effect had the class/audience known it was just a birthday card...

Future exploration of the mind
By ALEXANDER HAWKINSON
Junior in Cognitive Psychology
When most people think of psychology, what commonly comes to mind is an image 
of an old man with a beard, sitting in an armchair and relating mental state to sexual 
desires. Far from the truth, this stone-age view of the cognitive sciences has got to go. This 
misconception can be easily dismissed with one walk around the third floor of Baker Hall.
A peek in one room reveals not human beings, but computers that are learning without 
programming to do everything from read to drive a car down the highway. A look into 
another office displays a person playing a video game while their eye movements are 
tracked and recorded. Yet another nook of third floor Baker holds people huddling over 
magnetic resonance images of a person's brain. The psychological research going on today at CMU today is far from 
the misconceived Freudian armchair, pushing the field of cognitive science ahead at an incredible pace  in other 
words, it is the future.
Over the past few decades, the study of the mind has been broken up into a number of different approaches. 
There has been Neuropsychology, studying the brain from inside by looking at patients with brain damage and their 
behavior. There has been cognitive psychology, which has studied human performance on various empirical tasks and 
tried to make inferences about what is going on inside the head. There has been the Information Processing approach, 
attempting to model human behaviors symbolically as computer programs. More recently, there has been 
connectionism, working with neural networks that simulate networks of brain cells and learn without being taught 
the "rules."
After walking around the Psychology Department a bit and talking with some of the professors and researchers 
that can be constantly found there, some of the characteristics of the department that give it it's energy become obvi
ous. With a effort that is ahead of it's time, the Psychology Department here at CMU is bringing all of these different 
approaches to the mind together into one cohesive whole. With faculty working in all of these methods of research 
and bringing their ideas together, there is an air of excitement and expectation for the future that can be felt in the air.
The future of cognitive science is brighter than ever. The different fields of cognitive study have been approach
ing an understanding of the mind from all angles. Bringing the methods and findings of all of these fields together, 
the CMU Psychology Department is full of real promise. As the late Allen Newell instantiated in his last book, the time 
is ripe for moving from the many hypotheses about particular aspects of human thought to new unified theories of 
cognition and a real understanding of the human mind.
...And what will become of the artist? IDJ"
Artists as a whole, are optimists, they have utopic visions of the future  a future that shall be made for and by 
the creative. Finally the artist will no longer live on the fringe, finally they'll be able to support themselves, the people 
will come to see their work and it shall be accepted and understood. When asked about the future, many artists will 
make a reference to that glorious moment when art and life merge and become one.
Art is life and life is art. How this will manifest itself can only be speculated. The hope is that artistic creativity 
will become part of our everyday life, that the engineer and mathematician will be as concerned with beauty and 
insight as the visual artist or performer.
The curriculum at a school such as ours will have many of the same concerns as now, most importantly how to 
blend the new technologies with the established traditional forms of art. The artist will not be allowed to live ignorant 
of the possibilities of computers, robotics, and the new and varied media formats that will arise. Secondly, the artist 
will be taught in a different environment. Today the art student is influenced by the professors, the lecturers 
that visit, the local art scene, and the people with whom they share studio space. In the future the artist will 
hopefully be able to communicate with students and professors across the globe. The state of the art in Paris,
New York, or whatever is the new hip art center will be instantly accessible by the student through com
puter and video. If only the art critics are able to grow in their scope also....

This election season, campus has been filled with posters, buttons, and other 
paraphernalia advising prospective supporters of candidates viewpoints and 
track records, both good and bad. The 1992 Presidential race has been a 
particularly exciting one and has invited the support of everyone and anyone 
with an opinion.
Many students have even gotten their hands dirty in the political process this 
fall, including junior ECE major Kevin Boyle and junior political science/policy 
and management major Julie Malone, both of whom support President Bushs 
i-eelection.
Boyle, vice president for public relations for the College Republicans, has 
spent the last several weeks volunteering for the Bush campaign. Boyle has 
worked at Bushs Pittsburgh headquarters, the Westin William Penn, doing 
ptione-banking(askingpeople to donate theirtimeandmoney to the campaign) 
and sending out literature to local voters.
Boyle also brings back information on Bush policies to distribute on campus. 
The volunteers are a nice group, all working for a common goal.... We feel that 
the best candidate will win and that the best candidate is George Bush.
Malone, second vice chair of College Republicans, also volunteers downtown 
at the campaign headquarters and hands out information on campus. Malone 
also helped ran the College Republicans voter registration drive at the 
beginning of this semester.
She says, I have a complete philosophical difference with the Democrats.... 
I feel that Governor Clintons policies are socialistic in nature  people dont 
know what theyre getting into.
Both Boyle and Malone attended the Victory 92 rally with keynote speaker 
George W. Bush (the Presidents son) a few weeks ago. Boyle also attended last 
weeks Veterans Rally with Oliver North, and the Clinton rally in Market 
Square on Friday. We wanted to try to sway those who have gone astray, he 
said. Neither attended the Perot rally, which had a $3 admission fee.
When asked why they favor Bush in the upcoming election, both students

Its extremely unusual for a third party 
to successfully enter in.
According to Stroh, Bushs positive 
support tends to edge down, and
Clintons tends to bounce around, [but] 
Perots support is by far the most inter

charted, says Stroh.

There are aspects of all three candi
dates that appeal to voters, but no one 
candidate that incorporates all these 
aspects. 
 Patrick Stroh, 
director of political science program
has surged upward since his return. 
This surge has come as a result of two 
things  both his extremely effective 
ads and his impressive performance in 
the debates, says Stroh.
Eric Devereux, a guest lecturer and 
assistant professor of political science 
agrees. But Perots shooting blanks,
Devereux says, theres no real chance of 
his being olocted with such a volatile 
political record. There are aspects of all 
three candidates that appeal to voters, 
but no ono candidate that incorporates 
all these aspects.
Howover, the candidates' platforms 
are similar in some important regards.

When a man who has never 
held public office suddenly ap
pears on the ballot in all fifty 
states for the office of President 
the United States, thats inter
esting. When that man is consis
tently getting the support of 20 
Percent of the electorate, thats 
ews. And when that man is Ross 
pt. thats remarkable, 
freshman CIT major Frank 
hnson, who worked on the Perot
campaign this summer, says, I 
dont expect him to win, but the 
fact that a fifth of the people are 
going to vote for him shows some
thing about the attitudes the 
country has toward the political 
process in general.
Johnson worked in his home
town of Titusville, Penn., to get 
Perot on the Pennsylvania bal
lot. I basically went around town 
and got signatures of the peti
tion, he says.
He was also very disappointed 
when he dropped out.... The reason he gave was that he didnt 
want to throw the country into 
turmoil if the election was a plu
rality and went into the House, 
which looked possible. 
Supporter reaction to Perots 
dropout ranged from, There was 
no way he could possibly win, to 
He didnt have the guts to go 
through with it.
But when Perot came back last 
month, Johnson says he was, sur
prised and pleased, because it 
gave another alternative to Bush 
and Clinton. Thats when I looked
at his book and thought about 
what all the candidates had said, 
andl decided that for all his faults, 
Perot really was the best candi
date.
Johnson shares many specific 
ideas with Perot, and this is why 
hes casting his vote for Perot.
I believe that the biggest prob
lems facing our country rightnow 
are the national deficit and debt, 
and the loss of manufacturing 
jobs. I feel hes the only candidate 
whos addressing these issues, 
says Johnson.

Although some of us may consider ourselves 
pronounced political views, how many of us can 
done anything to stand up for them? We may 
Republican, Democrat, or independent, but hav< 
worked in the public to gain support for our cause?
Most of us will only be represented by a vote tomor 
Christy Moore, junior social history major, and CS c 
student Justin Boyan will be able to cast their votes for a ticket 
they actually worked to support.
Moore worked as an intern at the Clinton/Gore Campaign 
Headquarters in Western Pennsylvania this election year. She 
helped the deputy field coordinator, organizing door-to-door 
campaigns and banking funds for the ticket. She also served as 
a liaison to the headquarters on campus, pushing influence for 
the Clinton/Gore ballot.
Boyan serves as the head of CMU for CJ.intioj 
through that 250-member organization, helps the cam] 
phone-banking, working closely with the downto 
ters, and doing everything else he can to drum up 
ticket of choice.
Moores genuine, personal support of this ticket led to her 
desire to work for the campaign. I do believe in these candi
dates, she says. Many times, people will automatically vote for 
the Democrat no matter what, if they are Democrats, but I can 
truly say that I have looked at the candidates and chosen the one 
I believe will do the best job.
On the issues, both Moore and Boyan agree that, Clinton and 
Gore have a much better understanding of what it will take to 
create jobs, as Boyan puts it. He also says that the Democratic

ticket is much more mainstream in issues of choice and environ
ment.
Increasing voter registration and turnout has been a big goal of 
CMU for Clinton/Gore  as Boyan says, We want to do everything 
we can.... We want to get out the vote on election day, even if youre 
for the unthinkable candidate.
Clinton and Gore, Moore says, have made attempts to reach 
college-age voters, as well. Both Clinton and Gore even appeared on 
MTV to speak and take questions from younger voters, a move that 
Bush claimed was beneath the Presidency. Perot has also de
clined the invitation to appear. The effort by Clinton, which was 
also repeated by Gore, is a sure sign of his interest in young voter 
support.
Bushs current jump in the polls has made the race a bit tighter 
in these last few weeks, but both Moore and Boyan are positive that 
the Clinton/Gore ticket remains safe. Im sure well still pull 
through, Moore says. The media often pulls for the underdog at 
the last minute. President Bush isnt much of a threat, she says. 
Ross Perot can be considered just as threatening [due to the fact 
that he is taking Democratic votes].
Boyan says he is more cautiously optimistic, recognizing that it 
isnt over until it is, indeed, over.
The current CNN/Gallup Poll shows Bush beginning to bridge 
the gap between his popular support and that of the Democratic 
leaders (Clinton leads by two percent), but it is the electoral vote 
that will make the difference. Clinton currently has 38 states in his 
favor, only needing 27 for the win. I think Pennsylvania is the key 
state in this election, says Boyan. We can make or break the 
candidates.
Well see what happens Tuesday, says Moore. At least I can say 
I have justified how I will vote. [Working for the campaign] makes 
me feel like Im making a difference.
Boyan says, If theres one message that I want to get out, its that 
every vote counts. If you want a change, vote for Clinton/Gore.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  2 November 1992
Time editor discusses predictions for election
TIME, from page LI
you will see some fading [in Perot] but 
theres no election yetImay be wrong. 
Despite the lack of scandals this elec
tion has spawned, Cloud still character
izes 1992 as the most extraordinary 
political year in my memory.
He believes that this campaign has 
really focused on the issues and less on 
personal attacks: This has been one of 
the very best campaigns  very issueoriented, though there were some rough 
patches at the beginning. If you were 
listening you should have learned a lot 
about health care and the deficit. 
Cloud presented his own personal char
acterizations of the three major candi
dates.
Cloud said he was really quite sur
prised when Clinton chose Gore as his 
running mate. He then described the 
young pair as two yuppie southerners 
and a white-collar yuppie ticket with
Perot received an even harsher char
acterization: Perot with his paranoia, 
the Viet Cong running across his front 
lawn and so on.
Bush was simply described as down
cast and unhappy, paying for four years 
of slight-to-zero attention to domestic 
policy.
The last part of the lecture Cloud en
titled The Wonderful World of Presi
dential Politics and How We Choose.
Though Cloud feels the American sys
tem of electing a President is not the 
best, it will take a major effort on the 
part of all Americans to correct the prob
lems. The problems as Cloud describes 
them are too much television and too 
much money.
Cloud advocates public financing of 
elections and strict limits on campaign 
spending.
Money is the mothers milk of poli
tics.... Public financing with limits on all 
campaigns will relieve candidates of the 
need to raise money, he said.
Another problem Cloud sees with the 
current election process is television, 
which he believes shortens what voters 
learn about the candidates to a 10-sec
ond clip.
Pictures, Cloud says,' are not al
ways worth a thousand words. Some
times they are worth about the 10 words 
of a sound bite.
Though Cloud criticizes televisions 
role in Presidential elections, he does 
think that press coverage is better this 
year than it has ever been before.
Currently, the media is engaged in a 
systematic review of the candidates ads 
and we [the media] have gotten off the 
[candidates collective] bus. We now 
send people in and then they come out 
we are much less controlled by the can
didates.
Cloud finished his lecture by enter
taining questions from the students. 
When asked about the role of college 
students in this years election, Cloud 
said that it remains to be seen.
Students have been registering in 
record numbers (reversing a 20-year-old 
trend of decreasing registration) and, if 
they all vote this year, this may be the 
long-awaited year of the Youth Vote.
Cloud credits the rise in youth regis
tration in part to MTV and their mas
sive Choose or Lose drive, as well as the 
music industrys Rock the Vote cam

him, the public is

What the public is really looking

says, is simply disappointed.
The campaign is mostly driven by

public perception, and advertisements 
in the visual media have beou very 
influential in disturbing the dividing 
line between fiction and truth.
In the early days, the candidate is 
_______________ running for Presi

he cant get there, 
he cant get to the 
White House, says 
Roddy.
After Tuesday, 
though, all the 
smear ads and 
sound bites wont 
make a bit of dif
ference.
In the good, the 
bad, and the ugly 
world of politics 
there can be only 
one winner, and 
this Tuesday that 
winner will be chosen to bo the 42nd

Boyle also says that the recent 
economic slow-down was not a

had four straight quarters of eco

Bush is also in favor of the

In addition, Boyle says, I do

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  2 November 1992L5
Mr. Fraternity offers crazy men chance to 
compete in togas, evening wear, talent

By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Staffwriter
The giddiness is tangible as 
the contestants get ready for the 
opening competition. Everyone 
has worked hard to reach this 
pointprimping and priming to 
become glamorous enough to be 
chosen the 
winner.
The pres
tige of this 
title is such 
that the 
contestants 
consider 
this more 
than just 
another
beau-ty contest. It is the combin
ing of beauty, talent, and intel
lect. Yes, its the sixth annual 
Mr. Fraternity contest, brought 
to you by Kappa Alpha Theta.
The event opened with the 
beach wear competition. This 
ranged from men flexing their 
muscles to guys bopping around 
in scuba outfits. Some of the con
testants looked as though they 
had just finished lifting weights, 
while some looked like they had 
just finished lifting a pitcher of 
beer and a large pizza. Obviously 
this was an equal opportunity 
contest.
Mike Arajakis, from Beta Theta 
Pi, stood out from the rest of the 
competition in a costume that 
would make all serious cross 
dressers drool with envy  it 
included fishnet stockings and 
pasties.
The beach wear competition set 
the pace for the rest of the 
evening, with each fraternity 
member trying to out-bizarre the 
others.
One might wonder why all this 
frivolity was going on. In 1984, 
over the Thanksgiving holiday, 
Theta sister Karin Johnson died 
of Sudden Asthma Death Syn
drome, a problem which affects 
teenagers and young adults that 
are afflicted with asthma. Hence, 
the sorority has this event every

weights while some looked like they 
had just finished lifting a pitcher of beer 
and a large pizza.
year to raise money for the Cen
tral Ohio Lung Association and 
the Karin Johnson fund. It cer
tainly seemed successful. Skibo 
Ballroom was packed.
Toga wear followed the beach 
wear competition. Once again, 
Mike Arajakis wins for original
ity with a duct tape toga (ouch), 
followed closely by the saran wrap 
model (by Theta Xis Victor 
Carter). There was also the popu
lar scuba look in lieu of toga, 
sported by Alpha Epsilon Pis 
Brian Shevelenko. It cant be easy 
to be original with a toga, but 
these men found a way to do it.
The talent competition was an 
experience that is hard to de
scribe without using one word  
homoeroticism. Tutus and power 
tools were the highlights of this 
competition.
Roy Devine, Alpha Tau Omega, 
performed (sort of) a sparingly 
light ballet.
A chain saw took center stage 
as Jason Grabarczyck did either 
an imitation of Tim Allen or of
Bob Villa and cut out Kappa 
Sigma letters from plywood. 
Dressing in womens clothes 
seemed to be the thrust of the 
talent competition, if not the event 
as a whole. I got the feeling that 
either these men were extremely 
secure, or not quite.
The event closed with the for
mal wear 
competition 
and the an
nouncing of 
the winners. 
Each contes
tant was 
asked a differ
ent question,
________________ and some actually an
swered coherently. Nothing too 
surprising here.
Out of all the silliness that hap
pened during the evening, there 
was something that I thought so 
ironic, I had to write about it. Tjie 
whole event was to raise money 
for the Central Ohio Lung Asso
ciation and at intermission half 
of the crowd (including myself) 
was outside sucking down ciga
rettes. Go figure.
The envelope please ... and the 
winners are as follows: Mr. Con
geniality goes to Arajakis of Beta 
Theta Pi. Third place belongs to 
the house of AEPi and Sheve
lenko. Grabarczyk, Kappa Sigma, 
took second place and (drumroll 
please) Mr. Fraternity 1992 is 
Stephen Lightfoot of Phi Kappa 
Theta.
I asked Lightfoot, Youve sur
passed all competition, and 
proven yourself a man among 
men. What are you going to do 
next?
Im going to Disneyworld, he 
said. Honest, he really did.

Can't afford to save for retirement? ' 
The truth s, you can't afford not to. 
Not when you realize that your retirement 
can last 20 to 30years or more. Youll want 
to live at least as comfortably then as you 
do now. And that takes planning.
By starting to save now, you can take 
advantage of tax-deferral and give your 
money time to compound and grow. 
Consider this: set aside just $100 each 
month beginning at age 30 and you can 
accumulate over $192,539* by the time 
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and 
you'll have to budget $227each month 
to reach the same goal.
Even if youre not counting the years to 
retirement, you can count on TIAA-CREF 
to help you build the future you deserve 
with flexible retirement and tax-deferred 
annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of invest
ment choices, and a record of personal 
service that spans 75 years.
Over a million people in education and 
research put TIAA-CREF at the top of 
their list for retirement planning. Why not.

The Prodigal Son dances 
into Benedum Center
By SYD RODRIGUEZ
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theater 
brings to the stage a modern mas
terpiece in George Balanchines 
The Prodigal Son. The Russian 
choreographer retells the parable 
of a rebellious young son who 
leaves his family for the excite
ment of city life, only to come 
back to his father begging for 
forgiveness.
City life had betrayed the son 
and left him without friends, 
home, or money. Balanchines 
retelling is less traditional than 
the original parable because of 
the inclusion of the sons adven
tures in the city.
Balanchine left Russia in 1924 
and was immediately invited to 
join Serge Diaghilu as a dancer, 
choreographer, and ballet mas
ter for the prestigious Ballets 
Russes. Balachines stay with
Ballets Russes served as anl 
apprenticeship for the youngj 
choreographer who had al-] 
ready earned a reputation as f 
a dazzling dance master. His u 
time with the dance compnay i 
was fruitful due to the cre
ation of Apollo and The Prodi
gal Son. These works, now j 
considered masterpieces, 
premiered in 1928, 
when he was only 25 j 
years old.
The Prodigal Son 
was a major collabora
tion between the com
poser Sergei Proko
fiev, designer Georges 
Rouault, and chore
ographer Balachine. Cuttinge d g e and 
ahead of its 
time when it premiered, the choreography re
mains just as imiovative today. 
Critic John Martin wrote in 1950: 
It is a sturdy, substantial, and 
meaty piece of choreography, with 
just enough fresh and creative 
material in it to supply 10 bal
lets. It is gauche and cruel, funny 
and nave, lascivious and 
tender... .It moves with direct and 
dramatic force, through fantastif cally perceptive and darV ing episodes, to a conclu
sion of irresistible emo
tional character.
The Prodigal Son is being 
performed at the Pittsburgh Bal
let Theater from November 5-8. 
The Pittsburgh Ballets Rush Pro
gram offers tickets to students at 
50 percent of regular seat prices. 
Tickets are available only at the 
Benedum Center box office on 
Seventh Street at Penn and Libr erty Avenues.

Tartan Diversions Co-Editor
Robert Perdziola (Drama, 1983) has awed audiences, mainly 
opera, with his beautiful costume and set designs. His story is one of 
a Pittsburgh boy who struggled to survive in a big city but overcame 
the difficulties that are part of the business. The result is his fame. 
His costume and set designs are at a premium for many operas, 
ballets, and currently, movies.
He started by scene painting for the theater on and off Broadway. 
Two years later, he began scenic designs for the Metropolitan Opera. 
Since then, the doors have been opening for Perdziola.
Perdziola has ventured into projects that include costume and set 
designs for the San Francisco Opera Company, Santa Fe Opera, 
Saint Louis Opera Theater, Canadian Opera Company, Glimmerglass 
Opera, San Francisco Ballet, the Manhattan School of Music, and 
more.
Perdziola was involved in an update of a Greek tale, La Calisto. He 
costume-sketched this 1989 production for the Santa Fe production. 
It is a story of the god, Jove. He descends to the earth in order to 
seduce Calisto, a faithful follower of the goddess, Diana. Diana is the 
goddess of the hunt, virginity, and the moon. Calisto practices purity 
and does not succumb to Joves passes. So Jove transforms into a 
Diana look-alike, in order to attain Calistos attention. (Calisto and 
pseudo-Diana have an affair. So, Im assuming lesbianism does not 
count as losing ones virginity.) Joves wife, Juno, finds out about 
Joves unfaithfulness, becomes furious, and turns Calisto into a bear.
Jove pities her and places her in the 
sky as a constellation, making her 
safe from his wifes fury. The stereo
typical way to costume this Greek 
myth would be to design togas and 
grapes. But this opera was imple
mented in order to play on the 
sexual sides [through] high couture 
and futuristic things, Perdziola 
says.
A period piece for the scenery in 
the up-and-coming Martin Scorsese 
film, The Age of Innocence, was re
cently completed by Perdziola. The 
film, starring Daniel Day-Lewis,
Michelle Pfeiffer, and Winona Ryder, 
will be released next year. As assis
tant art director in the movie,
Perdziola recreated New York City 
in the 1880s. This entailed repro
ducing the no-longer-standing New 
York Academy of Music, originally 
located on Fourth Street. Perdziola said much time and 
research was necessary in order for the entire composition to 
come together.
But what was more interesting was that he gained a

By KRISTEN BEVERIDGE
Tartan Staffwriter
With the 1992 Presidential election 
well at hand, what could be a more 
appropriate thought-provoker than CFA 
graduate student Andrew Johnsons in
stallation, Presidents Day Sale, cur
rently on exhibition at the CMUs 
Hewlett Gallery? This installation is 
one in which viewer interaction and 
participation is vital. Dont expect to 
walk into the Hewlett and experience 
Presidents Day Sale without being 
challenged to think aboutcurrent Ameri
can government and political issues and 
how each individual has a personal re
sponsibility in promoting progress and 
change in the U.S.
In the front room of the gallery, 
Johnson has three TV monitors, each 
running a separate video involving fire 
and flames which have occurred during 
Bushs presidency. One depicts fires from 
the Gulf War, another from the L.A. 
dots, and the third from an Act Up AIDS 
rally during the Republican National 
Convention. This room has also been 
split into two vertical sectionsthe top 
half of the room is separated from the 
bottom by a sheer screen.
In the center if one looks upward, 
there is a small tree representing George 
Bush, and around the moulding of the 
Wiling the phrases EDUCATION 
PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL 
PRESIDENT, KINDER AND lwp
tDn NATION AND WE ARE THE 
DREAM TEAM written in large, gold 
letters. The screen, says Johnson, is 
used to show the separation and inaccessibility of government, especially the 
President. Directly under the tree on 
the wood floor is a pile of elephant dung, 
^gnifying what the American people 
mean to the President and how they
perceive themselves in the eyes of poli
ticians.
The second room of the Hewlett is also 
divided into two sections by scaffolding. 
There is a sign at the dividing line that 
reads, Maximum Occupancy 1% of the 
Population, which means that only a 
few can be on the top of the scaffolding 
at a given time. These people are sym
bolic of the small population of wealthy 
elite. Underneath the scaffolding on the 
ground are gold plates on which are 
written American social statistics since 
1988 when Bush was elected President, 
like Americans Unemployed for Six 
Months or More up 133%. National Defi
cit up 157%. Americans on Death Row 
up 22%.
The scaffolding can be ascended by 
stairs, and it is here that the viewer is 
truly asked to participate. First of all, as 
in the first room, there are gold letters 
around the molding that read JOIN 
ME IN OUR NEW CRUSADE TO REAP 
THE REWARDS OF OUR GLOBAL 
VICTORY. In this section of the instal
lation, individuals are invited to answer 
four questions on a questionnaire. After 
it is completed, the individual must walk 
around the scaffolding, examining other 
peoples questionnaires which have been 
completed and dropped into frames 
hanging on the walls.
A shade can be pulled down over the 
responses with which the viewer dis
agrees. When viewers find responses 
similar to their own, they can slide their 
sheet into place over top of it inside the 
frame, which causes the composition of 
this section to change continually. This 
is one of the artists chief aims in the 
piece.
The four questions asked: What do 
you think are the most important prob
lems facing the U.S.A. today? What are 
you personally doing to improve these
situations? What in your opinion in
hibits resolving these problems? What 
image do you have of the U.S.A.? He 
also calls for a self -description, al
though this is optional. Many of the 
answers given by the viewers are simi
lar  many people have written in 
response to question one that the defi
cit, racism, poverty, education, and la
ziness are the major current problems 
facing us. Sometimes there will be a 
very original answer. One person wrote 
that the major problem is that fact that 
he is not famous yet, and continued to 
say that our difficulties will be resolved 
when he becomes famous. In terms of 
question two, not many people seem to 
be doing anything right now to change 
our situation. Most said that they are 
active voters and some are involved in 
community service, but thats about 
all. Question three, asking for Ameri
can inhibitions, derives ideas such as 
bureaucracy, politics, and lack of faith 
or hope in the country. Ego problem is 
a common view point for question four 
on the image of America, along with 
the fact that our leadership is poor. 
One person said that his image of 
America was that it looks like a steak. 
There are probably many more inter
esting responses in the boxes Johnson 
has collected since the opening of the 
installation on October 16.
Even if you cant make it to the 
Hewlett Gallery to experience this 
thought-provoking exhibit, these issues 
are ones which we all need to be con
templating, especially at this point in 
our nations life.
Hopefully it will encourage people to 
take these problems in America to 
heart and to start acting to promote 
change in our society. These are cer
tainly things that artist Johnson is 
asking us to ponder.
Sampling African art at Carnegie
By MEGAN GURGON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
A Mercedes Benz-shaped coffin, red 
and green molded plastic dolls, and a 
pair of Chi Wara headdresses are a 
few of the 130 innovative objects visi
tors can view at The Carnegie Mu
seum during the exhibition, African 
Explorers: 20th Century African Art, 
which runs from this Saturday through 
January 10. The broad selection of art 
reveals the rich and 
complex modem cul
ture resulting from 
the merging of many 
different forms of vi
sual, intellectual, 
and historical dimen
sions.
The exhibition 
challenges two wide
ly held misconcep
tions abgut 20 th cen
tury Africa: that its 
traditional art be
longs to a culture glo
rious but extinct; and 
that there is no mod
ern African art, 
merely a second
hand version of 
Western art, says Susan Vogel, cura
tor of the exhibition and executive 
director of The Center for African Art, 
New York, where the travelling exhi
bition originated.
Western contact has been influen
tial in 20th-century Africa addi ng ideas 
and imagery to the matrix of already 
existing African art forms. The broad 
range of expression presented in the 
exhibition demonstrates the continu
ing vitality of traditional art, which 
coexists today with modern art 
uniquely African.
courtosy of Carnegie Museum of Art A pair of Chi Wara Headdresses made of wood and raffia.
Contrary to popular belief, African 
societies are not static; they are con
tinually changing. European political 
and economic presence during the co
lonial period introduced numerous 
changes for African society and cul
ture. Repercussions from these influ
ences echo throughout the 20th cen
tury since most African nations be
came independent during this period. 
These changes have had a profound 
effect on artists of Africa, and is re
flected in the styles 
of expression. Much 
of 20th century Afri
can art attempts to 
define the character 
of contemporary Af
rican culture and to 
negotiate Africas re
lationship to the 
West, to Islam, to 
Christianity, and to 
its own artistic heri
tage. The artwork in 
African Explorers re
flects an assortment 
of media and styles, 
and is arranged into 
five categories pro
viding a conceptual 
framework for de
scribing African art in the 20th cen
tury. They are called New Functional 
art, Traditional art, International art, 
Urban art, and Extinct art.
In celebration of African Explorers, 
The Carnegie Museum is hosting an 
array of lectures and events focusing 
on the historical, social, and artistic 
implications of the exhibition. More 
information on the specifics can be 
obtainedduringmuseum hours:Tuesday through Saturday from 10 am to 5 
pm and Sunday from 1-5 pm. Admis
sion is $3.

L12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  2 November 1992
Either/Orchestra spices up coffehouse
By TINA L. URSO
Tartan Production Manager
When I hear  big band, it us
ually calls to mind a picture of 
silver-haired men sitting up on 
the stage of a local dance hall 
swinging to the tunes of Goodman. 
With all due respect to Benny 
Goodman, its not exactly the pin
nacle of avante garde jazz sound, 
if you know what I mean.
. The 10-member band Either/Or
chestra, a big band by all technical 
terms, certainly ripped through 
the seams of this ill-fitting defini
tion when it blew into the Tilted 
Square this past Monday at 8 pm, 
promoting its most recent release, 
,The Calculus of Pleasure.
As the name implies, Either/ 
'Orchestra is able to give listeners 
the best of both worldsinterest
ing new music with the full sound 
of big band orchestrations. The 
performance Monday night proved 
that not only can it play the clas
sics with life and beauty but also 
innovative new songs with lots of 
interesting, whacked-out sounds.
. The band opened with Grey, 
(composed by Bob Nieske, the 
bands upright bass player who 
was not present at Monday 
evenings performance) a beauti
ful soft ballad which featured a 
bass solo by John Turner and an 
incredibly moving flugelhorn solo 
by John Carlson (which just goes 
to prove that brass instruments 
really can sound great if theyre 
played right).
Other songs performed in the 
first set were The Look of Love, 
a Burt Bacharach tune of James 
Bond fame; a brand new song 
called H.A.C., which featured 
some really interesting percussion 
support and a trombone solo by 
Russel Jewell; and Theres a Bus 
Thats Leaving Soon for Alvin 
Bergs House, a tune almost as
interesting as its name, in which 
the band pulled together tight 
enough to make this one of the 
best performances of the first 
set.
After a short break during 
which the band members came 
down off the stage and mingled 
with the small coffeehouse 
crowd, they opened up with 
Bennie Motens Weird Night
mare  my favorite song from 
their latest releasewhich fea
tures a bass clarinet that lopes 
at an elephants pace through a 
dream world created by the rest 
of the band. The band continued 
the second set with two arrange
ments of more classic jazz tunes: 
Duke Ellingtons Prelude to a 
Kiss, which featured an excel
lent sax solo by Andrew dAngelo 
and McCoy Tyners Vision, 
which featured many good solos 
by various members of the en
semble, and was also one of the 
most together pieces of the 
evening.
The band seemed to be get
ting better as the 
evening pro
gressed, and 
left its best 
performance 
for last. Circle 
Bad, the bands 
strange mutated 
synthesis of 
Miles Davis
Circle in the 
Round and 
Ellingtons I 
Got it Bad 
and I Got it 
Good, was, with
out a doubt, the hottest piece of the 
whole night. This 
long piece began with 
an absolutely amazing 
free-form improvisation by 
Turner on upright bass that
went on for a full two minutes 
before any other members dared 
to stop him. The rest of the en
semble came in, gradually build
ing from a whisper, playing 
calmly, but this proved only to be 
a set-up for a musical shouting 
match between dAngelo on sax 
and Tom Halter on trumpet, 
which resulted in high but wellcontrolled musical screams from 
each and shouts of admiration 
from their fellow group members.
After cooling off from this 
heated debate, the ensemble came 
back in full force and built from 
there, creating a mass synergism 
of sound and frenzy that just 
wouldnt let up. A sort of chaotic 
madness that, in the end, seemed 
somehow to relate a kind of musi
cal reason. It left me with goose 
bumps for a good three minutes 
after it was finished.
Then, after a wave of applause, 
the band broke into a soothing 
rendition of Dylans Lay Lady 
Lay  a much-needed depres
sant after the energy of Circle 
Bad  before it said 
goodbye and promised to 
come back to Pittsburgh. 
I once was told that 
white jazz musicians 
could never be any 
good because they 
have no soul. After seeing these 
guys, I dont 
think Ill believe 
that ever again. 
Make sure you 
see them the 
next time 
they come 
to Pitts
burgh. I 
promise it 
will be 
worth the 
wait.

A Ford development team examines a flexible fuel 
vehicle at the Dearborn Proving Grounds.
PERDZIOLA, from page Lll
different perspective within the drama industry 
because the pace in a movie was faster .He says it 
is miserable and difficult [due to the] artistic 
temperament and insecurities as well as the 
time constraint. For example, there is the prob
lem of meeting the preconceived high expecta
tions of the director, or if one [director] has bad 
taste. In other words, it appears to be more like 
a psychological game where one must convince 
the director of the artists visual sense. Also, 
flexibility is needed in order to combine the 
designers and directors visions.
A period piece differs greatly from designing a 
kitchen because a period piece entails acquiring 
information and being able to take the informa
tion and reproduce it in a his
torically correct and visually 
pleasing way. The end result is, 
as Perdzioia states, one vision 
which seems as if it is the ex
pression of one person, although 
it is the consensus of the group, 
the director, the actors, and 
more.
In the case of the Scorsese 
movie, there was the problem 
of the different environment in 
the 1880s in terms of lighting, 
drapery, and wallpaper. Also 
tremendous amounts of antiques were needed, and were not readily available.
A costume designer is different from a fashion 
designer because a costume designer investigates 
the historical and geographical placement of a char
acter in order to capture the look of the character. 
Fashion designers design for the public and do not 
have to, as Perdzioia mentions, realize a character; 
A costume designer recreates a sense of history.
All of this adds to the excitement of the film, arid 
it pushes an artists limitations in order to create tH!e 
best possible work within the time frame. Perdzioia 
believes one must rise to the occasion, so a project 
becomes fun. He also feels the most fulfilling work 
was the result from a good working environment 
because one creates better that way.

Where Angels Fear To Tread
E.M. Forsters Where Angels Fear to Tread was called a stinging comedy of manners by Rolling 
Stone magazine. The name E.M. Forster should ring a bell. He is the author of the beautiful and .brilliant novel, A Room With a View.Here director Charles Sturridge has captured Forsters wit and wisdom, the essence of the novel. This elegant comedy of manners stars Helen Mirren as Lilia, a strong-willed widow who becomes enamored with her Italian lover. She impulsively marries him despite the disapproval of her conservative upper-class in-laws. Where Angels 
Fear To Tread also stars Helena Bonham-Carter, Judy Davis, Rupert Graves, Barbara Jefford, and Giovanni Guidelli.So if youre a Forster fan or simply in the mood for sophisticated sappiness, Where Angels Fear to 
Tread is great entertainment for your dollar. ; At 6, 8, and 10 pm.
Friday, November 6
Batman Returns
What I think happened here was that there were eight or nine proposed screenplays for this movie, and somehow they all got mushed up into one, and then someone used about half the pages for a shopping list. The producers decided to compensate with Danny DeVito and many explosions. The end.In this sequel to the wallet-vacuuming 1989 blockbuster, Batman takes on the villainous Penguin and Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfieffer, for reasons that are never made particularly clear.The fast-paced fun of seeing a favorite hero onscreen is completely overwhelmed by the absolute absurdity and unfollowability of the storyline. Subplots fly out of the blue and disappear without . jurther mention.Dramatic action is nil or less, because the Caped Crusader is never in danger for more than 30 seconds. The dialogue makes one wince. See this one only if youre obscenely bored.At 5, 7, 9,11 pm, and 1 am.
Saturday, November 7
Lethal Weapon 3
Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Joe Pesci are together again in Lethal Weapon 3. This time our favorite cops, after indulging in some pointless police brutality by harassing a jaywalker (which is unsettling in the wake of the Rodney King trial and the L.A. riots), take on a former cop gone bad.Rene Russo plays an officer in the departments internal affairs department who joins Gibson and Glover on this case, since the bad guy is stealing weapons confiscated by the police and selling them on the street.Predictably enough, Russo and Gibson get romantically involved. The big question is whether or not shell make it to the end of the movie alive or kick off like Gibsons love interest in Lethal Weapon 
2 and his wife before the first Lethal Weapon.If you liked the first two, youll like the third one. Its the worst of the three, but not bad, especially if youre feeling bloodthirsty. Worth the dollar.At 5:50, 8,10 pm, and 12:15 am.
Sunday, November 8
Heavy Metal
Evidence that you dont need to take screenwriting courses to graduate from animation school, Heavy Metal embodies the definition of gaudy sci-fi. This cult favorite is divided into several loosely-related mini-stories, some of which are amusing, and others of which are exercises in mass gore.Most are drenched with overblown sexual fantasy that suggests that the animators really needed to get out more. Dont expect much plot, but theres enough amusement value and good one-liners to warrant spending a dollar to see it  once.At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

PREVIEW
Lemonheads will be doing that 
funky Lemonhead thing this Fri
day night, November 6, at 
Metropol. July will be the open
ing act. The show starts at 7:30 
pm, and it's all ages. You do, 
however, have to pay them $8 in 
advance, or $10 at the door (plus 
service charge).
Lemonheads got their first taste 
of big-time alternative success in 
1990 with the release of their 
debut album, Lovey, which made 
the top 10 on the U.S. alternative 
charts. It was also huge in Ger
many. Their next album was the 
CD5 maxi-single, Favorite Span
ish Dishes, which contained some 
quirky cover songs and a couple 
of songs written by singer/guitar
ist/songwriter Evan Dando. Their 
newest album, Its a Shame About 
Ray, combines pop, folky strums 
and heavy rock dynamics to 
achieve their post-modern 
sounds.
Dando, the only remaining 
charter member of the six-yearold Lemonheads, wrote the al
bum while on a solo tour in Aus
tralia with co-writer, Tom Mor
gan. Dando was inspired to write 
the song when one moring we 
were reading the paper and [Tom] 
brought to my attention this story 
about a kid who couldnt stay in 
school or something and it said in 
the last paragraph, Its a shame 
about Ray. We just freaked out 
about it. Having been sufficiently 
freaked, Dando headed back to 
the states and hooked up with 
drummer David Ryan, who 
played on Lovey, and bassist 
Juliana Hatfield.
If you want to get in on all the 
folky strums and post-modern 
sound Lemonheads have to offer, 
tickets are on sale now at se
lected National Record Marts, 
Cogos, Homes Downtown, and 
the Palumbo Center box office.

The Ramones are coming to 
Carnegie Mellon on Friday at 7 
pm and will play in our own 
humble Skibo Ballroom courtesy 
of AB and your Activities Fee. 
Opening will be Overwhelming 
Colorfast and Social Distortion.
This legendary quartet has just 
released a new album, Mondo 
Bizarro, which Joey Ramone calls 
the best Ramones album ever. 
Marky Ramone puts in his two 
cents, saying, Its a real Ramones 
album, and I think that sums it 
up. So do I.
The Ramones have been around 
forever  18 years, which is 
pretty much forever to the aver
age college student. They are per
haps one of the most influential 
rock bands to ever grace the 
planet. Spin magazine raved 
about the group: No group in the 
last 18 years has been more im
portant or influential, including 
the Sex Pistols (who probably
couldnt have existed without 
The Ramonos).
Their 1976 self-titled debut al
bum is often heralded as a musi
cal landmark. Ifthats notenough 
to make you fall in love with 
them, their 76 tour of England is 
cited by many punk historians 
as the spark that ignited the 
British punk explosion.
The two opening acts for this 
legendary, ground-breaking, 
trend-setting, influential, revo
lutionary group are not too 
shabby themselves. Social Dis
tortion is the only band to come 
out of L.A. in the 1979-1983 era 
that has survived and flourished. 
Overwhelming Colorfast is a 
relatively new band from the San 
Francisco Bay region and is, I 
suppose, showing much prom
ise.
Social Distortions musical 
style is best summed up by its 
founder and songwriter, Mike 
Ness: The music I wanted to do 
was a mix of blues, country, and 
Ramones-y punk. Whether or 
notRamones-y is actually a word, 
Mike Ness and his band have 
put out some darn good songs, 
such as Ball and Chain and 
Story of My Life. Their new 
album, Somewhere Between 
Heaven and Hell, is produced by 
Dave Jerden, who has produced 
for Janes Addiction and The Red 
Hot Chili Peppers. The album is
best described by the eloquent 
Noss who says, Its like a 
soundtrack to thoso old toonage 
exploitation films. Bikor hot rod 
rock n' roll marijuana orgy films. 
And its about love. Dangerous, 
desperate lovo. Sounds fun.
Overwhelming Colorfast hails 
from Antioch, California, a town 
that boasts a very smelly paper 
mill that natives claim could 
shrivel the brain of a hippo. Not 
to say that their music stinks, Im 
sure it doesnt, but one must won
der what influence the smelly 
paper mill has had on groups 
musical style. Actually, it can be 
described as a collage of sounds 
spanning the last three decades 
 Black Sabbath to Soul Asy
lum and Husker Du meets the 
Beatles. Overwhelming Colotfasts latest album is a self-titled 
LP produced by Butch Vig, who 
has produced for Smashing 
Pumpkins and L7. Front man 
Bob Reed says, We just set out to 
make the best power-packed 
music we could. Listen and be
lieve.
Dont miss this musical extrava
ganza happening right here in 
the Ballroom. If you want to be a 
part of this revolutionary, ground
breaking, marijuana-orgy-fihning, listoning-and-belioving, pa
per mill-smelling music-fost, tick
ets are on salo now for just $1 at 
tho Skibo Information Desk.
