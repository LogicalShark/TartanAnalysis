Society to Give 
Evening Lecture 
At Carnegie Hall
The Academy of Science and 
Art, an organization of Pittsburgh 
men and women interested in the 
advancement of science and art, 
will present an illustrated lecture 
by Arthur C. Pillsbury, Thursday 
evening at 8:15 in the Carnegie 
Lecture Hall. The lecture, Life 
in and Under the Sea, will be 
sponsored by Dr. Walter B. Scaife, 
a member of the organization.
* Mr. Pillsbury will show many 
startling pictures of how, without 
the ability to swim or without a 
weapon of any kind, he walked 
over the ocean bottom in the har
bor of Pago Pago, American 
Samoan Islands, set up his tripods, 
and pictured the coral and fish. 
He studied these under-water ani
mals in their natural habitat and 
sketched them as he found them. 
With a color chart that he made, 
Mr. Pillsbury registered their won
derful colors, and gathered speci
mens for lapse time pictures in the 
aquarium, where their life stories 
were pictured under the micro
scope and camera.

in the competition are: Benjamin 
Hoffman 34, second; Albert M. 
Travis, third; Albert Priddy, John 
G. Zeedick, and Arthur K. Yost,

Since the designs for both con
tests had to express some phase 
of life on the Planet Mars, the gen
eral theme of this years-Arts Ball, 
most unique and imaginative ideas 
were revealed .at the judgment. 
Participants, anxious to keep their 
presentations completely in ac
cord with the unusual. aspect of 
the competition, made use of a 
great variety of mediums to ren
der their  soliitions, some using 
Tempera, some air-brush and some 
cellophane. A jury composed of 
instructors in the. College of Fine 
Arts judged the entries on the 
basis of simplicity, uniqueness, and 
economy. Prizes will be awarded 
to the winners of each con Lest.

Chemistry. Dr. Barrett lectured 
before the American Society for 
Steel Treating in Philadelphia 
.January 6 on Radiography by

Margaret Morrison Girls Engage in 
Childish Games as Exams Approach
Did you ever, in the course of
>ur first childhood, indulge in an 
vixhillarating game of Three-Deep? 
Isnt it fun? Well, the Maggie 
Murphs those sophisticated young 
women who have frequently been 
appearing in print of late, may be 
observed at almost any time dur
ing the day playing Three-Deep in 
front of the official bulletin board 
bearing a big flasfiy sign on which 
appear the words final exam 
schedules. Not o$ly foolish 
freshmen and supercilious sopho
mores, but jealous juniors and 
sneering seniors have been caught 
in the crowd. No one is too high 
or too low in scholastic standing 
to enter competition, for this is 
how the game is played in the re
nowned School - With - the-NewDoor:
There is no rule-book, stylebook, hand-book, or what have you. 
Each girl is out for herself, unless 
her best friend, who is well toward 
the rear of the crowd, wants the 
' lisformation relayed back to her; 
in ifivat case, everyone suffers. An
other o\dd featureof the "game is
By LITTITIA LYTTELE
the depth of the long, irregular 
rows of lassies, which usually ex
ceeds the original two or three 
rows that the game requires. In 
fact it is usually quite impossible 
to discover any rows at all. (Per
haps it might be a good plan to 
rename the Maggie Murph version 
of the game Mob Scene.)
There is one striking similarity 
between the two versions, how
ever; as each participant finishes 
her copying of subjects and hours, 
she leaves the front'line, and the 
mob moves forward, filling up the 
wee space just vacated. Instead 
of screams of laughter which are 
usually heard on a crowd of 
Fems. groans and various ex
clamations of delight or dismay 
fill the air.
Special advice to the visiting 
engineers, by special permission of 
the copywright owners, is to ob
serve all this excitement from a 
distance, .or from the little white 
drinking fountain. Why? Be
cause engineers are still sufficiently 
infrequent advents in Margaret 
Morrison to cause a small stam
pede.

Dr. Schoen Maintains That Theology 
Is Primarily Contrary To Religion
Architects Receive
Beaux Arts Awards
In the recent judgement of Class 
B Design projects at the Beaux 
Arts Institute of Design in New 
York, three students of the Depart
ment of Architecture were award
ed honors. Edward M. Craig re
ceived a First Mention Placed, 
which is the highest award given 
in Class B while Thomas L. Orgill and Robert L. Schell received 
First Mentions. The problem was 
An Architects Residence and Stu
dio.
Dr. Max Schoen, head of the De
partment of Psychology, made a 
direct attack on theology as a fac
tor of religion in his address in 
Trinity Episcopal Church on Sun
day, January 22. He upsets a 
hitherto acknowledged theory 
when he maintained that theology 
the science of the existence and 
character of God and of his laws 
is primarily contrary to religion. 
Great interest was aroused by his 
contradictory assertion that physi
cal science, not theology, reveals 
the sole truths that will continue 
to promote Godliness in man.
The basis of the attack was Doc
tor Schoens opinion that theology 
is an enemy of truth. He con
tends that if men could break away 
from falsehood, exemplified in the
ology, they would be unhampered 
in their quest of true knowledge. 
Theology, then, is to be dealt with 
sternly, since It has undoubtedly 
been shown an. obstruction to the 
pathway of truth.
Doctor Schoen gave a worthy 
definition of religion, which, he in
sists, is an end . rather than a 
means. It is a passionate hope 
of a time to come when men will 
live in the consciousness of broth
erhood, a hope  fortified by an 
equally passionate conviction that
Raymond Barger 
Given Memorial 
Sculpture Award
Continuing his fine work in the 
field of sculpture at Yale Univer
sity, Raymond Barger; 32, Depart
ment of Sculpture,. was recently 
awarded second prize in the Yale 
Memorial Plaque competition. The 
contestwas conducted for the 
purpose of selecting a memorial 
plaque which will be hung in 
Pershing Hall in Paris to commem
orate the 227 Yale men who died 
in the Great War, All graduates 
and students in the Yale Depart
ment of Sculpture were Invited to 
submit models. In addition to the 
commission of the plaque by the 
winning sculptor second and third 
prizes of seventy-five and thirtyfive dollars were offered.
The winning plaque was execut
ed by George H. Snowden, a Yale 
graduate and a holder of the Prlx 
de Rome. Bargers model was ad
judged as the second best of the 
28 works which were submitted. 
The interest in the competition 
was exceptionally keen and Bar 
gers showing in a field of expe
rienced graduates, winners of the 
Prix de Rome, and instructors ot 
sculpture, is illustrative of his ex
ceptional skill and talent.
While at Carnegie, Bargers in
terests were numerous and varied, 
1-Ie was. prominent on the 
athletic field both as a cheermaster and as captain of the track 
team. 1-Ie is the holder of the school 
record for the pole vault.
Y.W.C.A. Cabinet 
Discusses Plans
The Y. W. C. A. Cabinet met last 
Wednesday todiscuss the plans 
for the coming semester. Alice 
Work, the president, urged the 
members of the cabinet to support 
the Womens . Scholarship Organi
zation' in its undertaking, the spon
soring of the opera, Rigoletto, 
in the Syria Mosque on February 
25. Members of the Freshmen Y 
cabinet will sell tickets and Cwens 
will usher and sell candy for this 
affair.
Tho Y cabinet plans to hold a 
dinner some time in March, at 
which religious discussions plan
ned for this year will be con
tinued.
Last Thursday a meeting of 
the Freshman Y cabinet was held 
in the Inn. The departmental 
speaker for this luncheon meeting 
was Dorothy Shults 33, Depart
ment of Secretarial Studies, who 
spoke on the advantages and disadvantages of her department.
the hope can become a reality pro
vided that, in some way, man can 
attain the truth about himself auu 
his world. To discover and re
move the disguises which obscures 
truth is, the problem to be faced.
The scientists method of acquir
ing knowledge is thorough investi
gation, after he first removes from 
his mind preconceived ideas and 
prejudices about the subject on 
hand. Scientific knowledge, Doc
tor Schoen continued, means de
pendable knowledge, knowledge 
that' gives control, power, simply 
because it makes prediction possi
ble.): It follows, therefore, that all 
progress man has made in control
ling his euviroment and himself 
is the direct result of scientific re
search. Theology, on the contrary, 
applies fiction, claimed to be of 
supernatural origin, to facts; if 
the facts, conform to the fiction 
they1 are accepted. Otherwise, they 
are rejeced or twisted into con
formity. Theology, Doctor Schoen 
believes, is of great value to the 
individual, but is valueless as im
personal fact. He stood firmly on 
the fact that theology, is distinctly 
irreligious because it is an obstruc
tion,' rather than promotion, of 
the supreme ideal of a kingdom of 
God on earth.
Dept. Ox-ganizes 
Student Branch 
Of Engineers
Students of the Department of 
Heating and Ventilating Engineer
ing met last Tuesday at 11:30 for 
the ;purpose of organizing a stu
dent branch of the American So
ciety of Heating and Ventilating 
Engineers.
. The business of the meeting con-1 
sisted of appointing a temporary 
chairman and several committees. 
Louis' Karges was appointed tem
porary chairman and the followirig committees were appointod: 
Committee for Nominations: John 
Ingold, chairman, Victor Mathis, 
and John Richmond; Committee 
for Constitution and By-Laws: 
Robert Smith, chairman, Everett 
Opperman, and Clarence Wright; 
Committee for Membership: Milto 
Simkin, chairman, and Ernest. 
Price.
The .purpose of the organization 
is to afford students in this depart
ment a chance to meet and hear 
members of the parent organiza
tion, and to permit members of tho 
upper-class to present papers.
A meeting for the election of 
officers will be held at 11:30.to

present.
Streamline Tests 
Disprove Theories
, The four graduate students who 
are working under the direction 
of Professor Blalsdell on air re
sistance tests in the Aeronautics 
Laboratory announce that they are 
making progress on the develop
ment of laws in the theoretical 
practices of air resistance. Two of 
the four students are making tests 
using an automobile on whichthey study the air resistance of 
tho different parts with the object 
to reduce this resistance to a min
imum; the other two work in a 
water tank, checking the results 
and recording by photograph the 
conclusions of the men who are 
using the automobile.
The students have proved that a 
theory on the reflection of air in 
which two models were placed to
gether backwards to produce the 
same result as a single model, Is 
incorrect. Although they proved 
that the former theory on the re
flection of air was untrue, and that 
air resistance could not be meas
ured by the old method, they 
have made no definite conclusion 
of their own.
CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Dean Keeble, chairman of the 
Faculty of the College of Fine 
Arts, wa3 born in Pittsburgh and 
received a private education in 
New York City with men connect
ed with the Chase School of Art. 
Among these men were included 
Henri in painting and Miller in 
music. Although most of his time 
was spent in 
painting, h e 
w-as chiefly 
interested in 
music; the 
principal fac
tor in this 
situation was 
his disinclin
ation to fol
low music as 
a profession. 
H i s liberal 
arts educa11 o n was 
rounded out 
Dean Keeble by wide read
ing, which such an educational 
plan favored.
After spending a year abroad in
similar study, Dean Keeble re
turned to Pittsburgh in 1911 to be
come Art and Music Editor of the 
former Gazette-Times, in which ca
pacity he served for nine years. 
Meanwhile, when in 1914 it was de
cided to increase the music en
semble at Carnegie to orchestral 
proportions he gave his assist
ance to this work. In 1923 he 
terminated his newspaper con
nections  to become temporary 
chairman of the faculty, and tho fol
lowing year lie assumed the per 
manent chairmanship.
In addition to his executive 
work, Dean Keeblo teaches a sen
ior course in musical analysis in 
which the aesthetic side of. the 
compositions studied is particular
ly stressed. His ability to imhue 
the subject with interest is the 
logical result of his own early 
zest for musical study, his critical 
training, and a thorough back
ground in the history of music.
He appears to be conservative in 
his reaction to the present day 
arts, but thoroughly alive to its 
possibilities; he believes there is

Student Directory Contains Much
Material for the Playful Punster
By M. Me
 With the publication of the Stu
dent Directory, comes an annual 
opportunity for the campus wits 
and punsters to seek out long 
names, short names, common 
names, odd names, solemn names 
and silly names. This year the 
hunting will be easy. Between Albrlno and Zollinger, we have every
thing from A to Z.
First there is foodFudge, Fish, 
Mellon, and best of all Evans 
Glieosoman from Coffoyvllle. Wo 
havo all kinds of plantsRoses, 
Flowers, Mosses, a Bower In which 
to grow thorn, and a Gardener to 
care for thom. (Wo liopo that tho 
Frost wont Wilt them). Then the 
animals, enough of thom to III! a 
menageriea Campbell, a-Lamb, a 
Baer, a Dormaus, a Hart, a Fox, a 
Roach, Herron, a Kuhn, a (Mot), 
calf, a Whalo(y), and a Dragon(Jac). Close in their wake are a 
Hunter, a Fisher, and a Trapp.
A further search reveals a Hus
band, a SIngel man, a Batchelor, 
(but no spinster, a Ladd, (but no 
lassie), a King, a Warden, a Squire 
and a Plummer. We also provide
a place to board them-------a House,
Shacks, and a Church.
and D. A.
Anticipating the repeal of the 
18th amendment, we have a Brew
er, a Stein, and two Beers and a 
Benderand perhaps as a result, 
a Shiner or Spots before the eyes. 
Wo have further dissipation in 
Dice and Gamble (ing), but In 
spite of it all, still have a Hale and 
a Hardy.
For more serious purposes we 
have some presidents  Grant, 
Hoover, Lincoln, Adams, and Wilson-and automobilesa Studobaker, two Fords, a Hudson, and 
Just a Kahr.
;rhore aro enough colors to make 
a Scotch Plaida Groon, a Black, 
a Gray, a Brown, a Scarlet, and a 
Black. There Is also another 
Black, a French black,Noir.
Get yourself an Atlas and See 
tho Soltz. You can take a Holiday 
In Paris, England, Glasgow, or if 
youro broke, out in Hazelwood. 
Do your Duty and Romp around

Carnegie Basketeers 
Lose To Duquesne; 
Nosed Out By Geneva
BECAUSE CARNEGIE STUDENTS were charged admission to tho 
Duqucsnc-Carncgle basketball game, several false impressions were 
crcatcd around the campus. To clarify these impressions Mr. Overend would like to make tho following statement:
"I would like very much to clarify a false impression that has 
been going around the campus in connection with the basketball game 
playod on January 27 between Duquesne University and Carnegie Tech 
in the Carnegie Tech gymnasium. This was Duquesnes home basket
ball game and was originally scheduled to be played in their gymnaeium, and upon their request, they were allowed the use of our gym
nasium to stage the game. Duquesne University managed the game 
entirely, supplying the ticket takers, ticket sellers, and paying for the 
officials."The game to be played on March 3 is Carnegie Techs game and 
will bo played in our gymnasium and all of our students will be ad
mitted free to this game. At this time Carnegie Tech will manage 
tho game, paying all expenses of officials, etc.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) CLARENCE OVEREND.
Dukes Easy 37-25 Win 
, Gives Them Lead in 
City Title Race
SLUMPING SKIBOS 
LOSE TO OLD RIVALS
CO-CAPTAINS FERGUS AND BOB SMITH hale found the going rather 
tough for tho Plaid quintet (luring the past several weeliH. After three 
straight victories, Pitt started the tide rolling In the opposite direction, 
and against Geneva and Duquesne the Tartans have failed to stop the 
enomy attack. So at the present time the Carnegie scorebook reads 
three victories and three defeats for a percentage of .500. On Monday 
night It looked for a while as if the undefeated record of the Coven
anters was going to be marred, but a late rally gave Captain Manning 
and his cohorts a 32-31 victory. It was a last minute heave by Art 
Grahame that provided the winning point. It was a tough game to 
lose, especially aliter the Plaid had compiled a 19-9 lead at the half.
ON FRIDAY NIGHT'COACH CHICK DAVIES of Duquesne brought to 
the Tartan gym a team which was as good as any seen in these parts 
In years. It was fast, clever, accurate. It really looked like a machine 
when their offense began to work, and it usually ended up by someone 
slipping under the hoop to score two points. Marty Reiter, diminu
tive Duke guard, was the center of the passing attack, but it was 
Birch, a sophomore, who usually did thei scoring. Birch accounted for 
eleven points against nine for Bobby Smith. Once more tough luck 
prevailed against the Scots when they were in the vicinity of the hoop. 
Many of the shots just rimmed the basket but wouldn't go in. It was 
a bad day for the foul shooting average of the boys, because they 
missed ten out of nineteen shots from the free throw line. The biggest 
factors in the 37-25 defeat, seemed to be that after losing the ball 
under the basket, the Tartans were slow in getting back into de
fensive position; for time and again the fast-breaking Dukes had the 
ball in scoring position before anyone was there to stop them.
It looks as if the Hannumites are going to have a hard time get
ting back into the winning column, because the next game is tomor
row night with the Tartans meeting Notre Dame out at South Bend. 
And those Hoosiers, with big Ed Krause playing center, have one 
eweet outfitl
COACH ERNIE SESTOS MITTMEN stood up berore the Dukes of 
Duquesne on Saturday night, and when the last'bell had rung it was 
found that tho Tartans had eked out a 4-3 decision for their first boxing 
decision of tho year. It was a well-earned victory considering the 
fact that the Tartans had only two veterans to use against their more 
experienced opponents. Atlas scored the first victory for' tho Plaids 
when ho won a decision in the 125-pound class. Captain Carr gave 
warning to his future opponents that they had better watch their step, 
alHo their chins, when they encounter him, for the Sldbo captain complotoly trouncod his Duquesne opponent. Bill Kulesz put on an excel
lent bout for a newcomer in tho ring game. He won his bout nicely 
and seorod the third point for Cavnoglo. Shoits Croissant, Carnegie 
light-heavy, had such a scowl on his face that ho frightened away all 
would-be opponents; so tho Sldbo footballer won Ills bout without op
position.Mux Hannum, that man of, many occupations, has added a now 
one to his fast-growing list. From now on Dor Maxle may ho known 
as that silver tone" tonor whoso charming voice put a velvety touch 
to that rough and roady gamo of boxing. Max was in the official ca
pacity of radio announcer for tho nmtchosand ho did do a. good job 
of It.
THE PLAID SWIMMERS HAVE THEIR FIRST MEET on February 
17 when they encounter Pitt In the Panther pool. Until then they will 
bo nunk deeply by their exnmn and our only hope In thnt enough of 
them will i)o resuscitated In time to enter the opening onngement. 
On Friday Conoh Rlnodorph had a practice meet within the squad. 
Throe teams formed the opposition: tho Whales, Seals, and the 
Sharks. Tho first named won by a whale of a score; so the Sharks are 
thinking of taking up cards Instead, and tho Senls have decided to 
clone their season for good.

Covenanters Overcome Ten 
Point Advantage to Take 
Close 32-31 Game
Tho annual Carnegie Tech midseason basketball slump accom
panied by its usual uncomforta
bly long crippled list, has descend
ed upon the Tartans a little earlier 
than is customary this year, and 
consequently Carnegie followers 
are wishing it a speedy farewell. 
Last week Fate added defeats at 
the hands of Geneva and Duquesne 
to the one previously administered 
by Pitt, leaving Carnegies season 
standing at three wins and three 
losses, and pushing the Plaid into 
the cellar position in the City 
championship race.
Last Friday, Duquesne had little 
trouble in handing the Skibos a 
37-25 trouncing and, much aB Carnegians resented the unsportsman
like attitude of the Duke follow
ing; keen as their disappointment 
was in Carnegies poor fortune un
der the hoop; and little as their 
respect Is for officials who allow 
the now rules to confuse them, 
nevertheless in all fairness it must 
bo admitted that Duquesne pre
sented a vastly superior team and 
one which is well on its way to re
tain the championship. The Tar
tans could at no time hit theiT 
real stride and, in addition to 
missing numerous free throws, re
peatedly permitted the fast-break
ing Dukes to drop many short onos 
in from under the basket.
On Monday preceeding the 
Duquesne affair Carnegie lost one to 
Geneva that might more nearly be 
placed In the jinx or tough luck 
section. Tho Tartains piled up a 
19 to 9 lead at ihe half time and 
had the Covenanter hoodoo all sot 
for a fade-out when the Tri-State 
Conference leaders put on a sec
ond period spurt and walked off 
with a 32-31 decision.
Disappointing as it lias been to 
drop three hard games to old riv
als, Carnegie followers neverthe
less sympathize with Max Han
num who has been working under 
every adverse condition that the 
crafty Dame Fortune could possi
bly conceive for a basketball 
coach. The students aro confident 
hat Maxlos basketeers aro duo for 
a change of luck ALLC and with the 
ailing mombors back in harness, 
Pitt and Duquesne will not have 
thlngB so easy next time.
Skibos Face 
Notre Dame 
On Wednesday
Ilannum Machine Hopes 
To Avenge Gridiron 
Loss to Irish
After an unfortunate week and a 
half in local territory, Carnegies 
courtmen are preparing for the 
last game of the current semester 
tomorrow night. Notre Dame's 
great aggregation of Green Ramb
lers will furnish the opposition, 
and the game will be played at 
South Bend.
Victory would sound mighty 
sweet to Tartan ears Wednesday 
night in view of the way the Irish 
mowed down this institution in 
that rather strenuous game called 
football. Revenge will not be the 
only motive for a hard Plaid drive, 
however, for Maxie Hannum's 
crew will be fighting to get back 
into the winning column; in the 
last three starts, they have finish
ed second no less than three times.
Notre Dame has also found the 
going somewhat rough this season, 
although they are supposed to 
have a great collection of cage 
stars on their roster. Purdue, 
Northwestern, Pitt, Marquette, and 
several other schools have laid the 
Irish low this year, but an equal 
number of other big-time teams 
have been 111 turn laid low by Mr. 
Krause and his mates.
In this aforementioned Mr. 
Krause, the Green have a very 
colorful and sterling performer. 
Being somewhat of a football player 
during the fall of the year, he 
makes an impressive sight 011 any 
court. To be sure, lie is a. com
paratively short runt, only stand
ing about six foot four, but he 
makes up for such deficiencies in 
sheer bulk.

One of Napoleons soldiers rose to fame on the Burn
ing Oven trick. A roaring fire was built in an oven 
... the temperature rose to 600 F. Into the oven 
walked the fire king, M. Chabert, carrying several 
raw steaks. A few minutes later the doors were flung 
wide and out he stepped ... safe and sound ... with 
the steaks thoroughly cooked.
thesrvricovf
Heat rises. When Chabert entered the oven he hung 
the steaks above the fire, in the center of the oven, 
then dropped to the floor at the side, covering his head 
with a hood made from his shirt. He breathed through 
small air holes in the floor. When the steaks were 
cooked he threw back the hood, grabbed the steaks, and 
stepped out in triumph.

Over Dukes
Duquesne Scores Three 
Knockouts But Loses 
By One Forfeit
Carnegie scored victory over the 
Dukes in the Intercollegiate Con
ference boxing meet last Saturday 
night.
Jack Croissant, Techs lightheavy entry, saw his mitt raised 
by Referee Schinton after climbing 
through the ropes for his bout, 
breaking the tie up to which Du
quesne had pulled in the sixth 
fight, in which John Cliapalla won 
by a technical knockout score over 
William Hart in the 165_-pound 
class.
Two additional knockouts were 
recorded, in the 115 and 145-pound 
classes. Fred Vitulla, Duquesnes 
lightest entry, showed the punch 
of a heavyweight when he pounded 
John Comuntzls to a nine-count in 
the second round.
Freddie Moore, last years East
ern Intercollegiate 145 - pound
champion and captain of the Du
quesne team, showed himself as 
one of the classiest fighters in the 
ring by scientifically putting 
away Tom Lowry after one round.
In the 135-pound class Henry 
Carr, Tech captain, earned a threeround decision over Dick Ehrlich, 
Duquesne contender.
William Kulesz, Tech 155-pound
er, showed some fine foot work in 
his win over Matt Rumoca of Du
quesne.
The Tech entry in the 125-pound 
class,, Ralph Atlas, won a decision 
after three rounds with Bob Gibb.

Simultaneously, last Friday aft
ernoon, the Womens Rifle team 
shot tlieir second and third match
es against the University of Neva
da and the Portsmouth, Ohio, Y. 
W. C. A. Once again, two of the 
outstanding members o the team 
turned in perfect scores. Leah 
Voegtly repeated her performance 
of the previous week, and Mary 
Wettacli succeeded in bettering 
her record by the single point nec
essary to make a perfect score. 
The rating were in the order an 
follows:
Voegetly ................................100
Wettach ..................................100
Schmelz .................................. 99
iLowrey .................................. 98
Schultz ............:................... 98
Due to the onset of examinations 
the team will be forced to give up 
shooting in favor of! cramming so 
that the next match will not be 
shot until February 25.
The credit for compiling the 
scores from the bowling season j 
just past is due to the manager, 
Monnie Watters. For the last 
week Monnie labored over the 
decimals and fractions until she 
finally announced that the Soph
omore team was high with 96.6 
points. The Freshman team -was 
second with 95.4, and the Seniors 
placed third with a score of 82.4. 
All of which proves that that 
smart Sophomore class is trained 
to kill. Fifteen girls from these 
classes received one hundred 
points towards their letter, and 
seventy-five points were awarded 
to several others. Jayne Hender
son ranked first of all individual 
scorers for the entire season.
News comes from Betty Wise 
Captain of the Freshman basket
ball team that their class has at 
last found a jumping center in the 
person of Betty Austin. Since 
this is the only position that the 
Freshmen were trying to fill we 
take it that they are thoroughly 
satisfied with the other five on 
the team. We wonder if it is go
ing to be like the Notre Dame 
squada high school captain to 
fill every position and six captain
substitutes. It wont be long un
til we find out.
Those three little shorties in 
the Sophomore class continue to 
run circles around everybody else. 
Poppy Warner, Marg Griffin and 
Ronny Kloos a*e threatened with 
extinction if they dont stop drib
bling under Ginny Linns and Mon
nie Watters arms. Its a disad
vantage to be short most of the - 
time, but again it looks like a gold
en opportunity!
As soon as exams are out of the 
way the old Sen.or team will be 
out to make up all the lost prac
tices. Marion McNary, Alma 
Busse and Kay Wlioley are set to 
make up for lost time and we are - 
depending on them to stop that 
threat of triplets that the Sopho
mores are boasting about. Thenumber of practices attended by 
all competitors for the class 
teams will be published nextweek. Til then!

Its fun to be fooled__
...its more fun to KNOW
"The Burning Oven" is an old illusion which has played a leading role in cigarette advertising. Its modern name is Heat Treatment. 
xpndadlbuaf All cigarette manufacturers use the heat-treating process.Cheap, harsh, raw tobaccos require intensive processing under high temperatures. The more expensive tobaccos, which are naturally mild, call for only a moderate application of heat.The first Camel cigarette was manufactured under the heat-treating process. Every one of the billions of Camels produced since has received the necCAMCLS
essary heat treatment. But remember' that heat treatment never makes cheap, inferior tobacco good. It is not in heat treatments, but in more costly tobacco and fine blending, that Camels find their appealing mildness and flavor.
It is a fact, well known by 
leaf tobacco experts, that 
Camels are made from finer,

Night Arts to Report 
In Thistle Hall Sat,DIDJA NOTICE
THAT last weeks ordeal 
seemed to be worse than a 
Spanish Inquisition to many. A 
good many of us are somewhere 
between relief and despair; re
lieved because it is all over, 
and despair because of what 
fate holds for us.
THAT the second term has 
just begun. Cheer up, fellow 
sufferers, the worst is over, for 
a few months at least.
THAT the last Council dance 
was about the swellest thing 
this year.
THAT because of the Arts 
Dance this Saturday p. m. the 
Arts school enrollment has 
more than doubled.
THAT a certain well known 
citizen is walking around these 
days with a far away look in his 
eyes. Its either heart trouble 
or a mild case of indigestion.
THAT you can always tell 
when Pop Manson has a good 
one on his mind by the way he 
smiles and gets a merry twinkle 
in his eye.
THAT the night art students 
are getting all worked up over 
the coming Arts Ball. Well, 
who wouldnt, even if it was 
only just to find out what an in
habitant from Mars looks like.
THAT a certain Industries 
boy is a gallant Don Juan and 
drives two little girlies from 
school to the wilds of the South 
Hills these nights. Well a cou
ple times a week anyhow.
THAT there wil be very little 
social life for the next few 
weeks on the night campus. Oh 
well, we need the rest.
THAT some of those cold 
winds blowing up the Cut" 
certainly makes us think of the 
comfortable friends we left at 
home and the good radio pro
grams we are missing.
THAT the S. P. C. A. is neg
lecting its duty by not taking 
care of our heroic campus 
steeds, those erstwhile horses 
that guard our campus so faith
fully.
THAT thats that and Ill be 
seenya.
Students of the Night College of 
Fine Arts interested in earning 
points toward an insignia award 
are asked to report in Thistle Hall 
this Saturday afternoon at 3 
oclock. Preparations for the dance 
to be held that evening are to be 
made and so that everything can 
be taken care of students are 
asked to report promptly. This 
notice applies to night arts stu
dents only.

This week marks the beginning 
of the second term of the present 
school year. It is the half-way 
point of our work and we may do 
well to pause and look back at 
what we have accomplished in the 
weeks that have just gone by.
Examinations are all over and 
we can breathe much easier, for a 
while at least. The results may 
not be as gratifying as we thought 
they might, but regardless of that, 
they will serve a good purpose. 
We can now calmly review the 
past, and in the cold light of pres
ent, results plot a course of proendure to follow in the future. A 
little more effort here and there 
may suillce to gain the desired 
end.
On the other hand some may 
have just completed a particular 
course and can now start on some 
other phase of their work. Care
ful deliberation coupled with the 
experiences we have already gain
ed should aid materially in making 
a wise selection.
In reviewing the past we may 
find that too much stress was 
placed upon certain subjects and 
too little upon others with the re
sult that, we may now be forced to 
change the procedure. The neces
sary change can now he made and 
we can go along our chosen course 
with the feeling that we are really 
accomplishing something as well 
as gaining knowledge.
Our troubles are not all class
room problems however. Old man 
winter seems to be trying his best 
to discourage that long, cold walk 
across the campus with the wind 
howling all around. To do this and 
keep doing it is a true test of de
termination and if by any cnance 
we have been wavering in our. zeal 
now is the proper time to brace up
Soft lights and enchanting music 
were the reasons why the PostHoliday dance, the most recent so
cial function held by the Night 
Student Council, was such a tre
mendous success. The large num
ber of students in attendance at 
this affair and their praise certain
ly indicates that there can be noth
ing better than a night school 
dance when one is looking for real 
entertainment and pleasure.
The huge mens gymnasium was 
transformed into a veritable ball
room with the aid of many colored 
spot lights and pennants. The 
lighting scheme was so synchron
ized with the orchestra that at 
every change of number and tempo 
the effect was reflected by the 
glow and intensity of the lights. 
The dreamy waltz numbers were 
extremely popular and the orches
tra willingly obliged with many 
 encores.
The whole affair was outstand
ing from every point of view. 
Those in attendance showed their 
appreciation and enthusiasm by 
entering to the festivities on this 
occasion, departing at the refrains 
of the final number with a feeling 
that the evening had been all too 
short. Another success can thus 
be written into the books of the 
Night Student Council.
Life on the Planet Marswhat 
can it be likewhat do the inhab
itants look likewhat do they 
wear  how do they live  the 
theme title and the unending ques
tions which such a title would sug
gest, have gripped the night and 
day students in the College of Fine 
Arts so intensely that this is all 
you hear talked about. The sub
ject is so fascinating that ones imr 
agination runs rampant with the 
possibilities and conjectures of 
what takes place on that myste
rious planet of Mars.
All this discussion has been 
caused by the fact that the Arts 
Ball to be held soon will have for 
its theme, Martian Life. The usu
ally sedate night student, stop 
those snickers, is deeply absorbed 
in this interesting subject. En
thusiasm mounts daily, or nightly, 
whichever the case may be, and 
one hears from all sides, Are you 
going to the Arts Ball? In most 
cases the answer is in the affirma
tive, the others have not quite 
made up their minds but there can 
be no doubt that they will fall in 
line and succumb to the lure of the 
Arts Ball.
Coming as it does only every 
other year, the students look for
ward eagerly to participation in 
this unusual event. The night stu
dent anticipates attendance at the 
party just as eagerly as the day 
student and, if present indications 
mean anything, they will be well 
represented on that eventful even
ing.
Ticket sales for the night school 
are being taken care of by J. Paul 
Stevens, assisted by Andrew N. 
Evans. Tickets may be purchased 
in two installments, $2.00 down 
and a final payment of $1.50, mak
ing a total cost of $3.50 per person. 
Each student will purchase his or 
her own ticket for the affair. This 
is an ancient arts custom and 
must be adhered to. Students 
wishing further information on the 
ball should consult the student 
men named above. They are reg
istered in the P. & D. department 
and can he found at school most 
any night. Anyone desiring to 
participate in the painting and 
construction work in making ready 
for the ball may do so by reporting 
to Mr. Stevens.
Frolic to he Held Saturday 
Night is Second One 
Held by Group
The traditional process of reju
venation of night art students is 
about to begin, under the guise of 
a dance to be held on Saturday 
evening, February 4, at Thistle 
I-Iall. It is claimed that as the 
result of this phenomena, all night 
art students present at this affair 
will become so imbued with the 
necessary inspiration to carry 
them triumphantly through the 
second semester.
If history repeats itself, then it 
is a foregone conclusion that those 
inhuman mid-term exams have 
wrecked havoc among this group. 
It is also a well known fact that 
such bedraggled people are unfit to 
begin the second lap in any kind 
of a race without inspiration to 
spur them on.
That familiar atmosphere of gayety and color, friendships and care
free youth, which is the envy of 
all other night groups, will again 
prevail. The smooth floor of This
tle Hall will once more reflect the 
feet of the dancers, tripping and 
gliding along, under the dim lights 
of the overhead reflectors and will 
arouse a. feeling of happiness.
The Venetian Serenaders have 
been engaged to furnish the music 
for the dance, and this group of 
musicians enjoy an enviable pop
ularity as a local dance unit. Their 
syncopated rhythm is enjoyed at 
every party and on each occasion 
new admirers are added to the 
growing list.
The chaperons for the affair 
will be Mr. and Mrs. Raymond 
Simboli, Mr. and Mrs. Karl Malclierek, Mr. and Mrs. E. W. Hick
man, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Squltiere, 
and Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Rosen
berg.
Admission will be by night arts 
registration card or by ticket 
which can he secured from the of
ficers of the Night College of Fine 
Arts. The dance Is restricted to 
the night students of this college.
There you are, the editor told 
me to cut down on my articles last 
week because there was not much 
space in the issue as most of the 
paper was already taken up. Ima
gine how I felt when the paper 
came out showing at the bottom of 
my column a whole lot of hoey 
about those people who dont know 
how to take care of their things, 
or something. Yes, I have lost 
things, sometimes because I was 
not careless, and sometimes be
cause I was careless, the latter 
cases being the most predominant. 
I have also found things and these 
finds are mostly the result of other 
peoples carelessness, so there you 
are. I have to stop writing just to 
let those careless individuals try 
to recover their lost ground. From 
now on I am going to hold onto all 
I have, even to this column, be
cause after all this is all I have on 
the campus, and if one doesnt as
sert himself somebody else will, 
leaving you out, yes, out in the 
cold.
Lee Taylor Casey, a notable 
writer for The Pittsburgh Press, in 
commenting upon technocracy, 
warns that it is doubtful and dan
gerous to permit the "experts to 
take control of our industrial life. 
To substantiate this claim, he 
writes that the scientists and en
gineers have been responsible for 
the position in -which the world 
finds itself today as a result of 
widespread unemployment. This 
unemployment, he contends, is the 
logical outcome of the labor-saving 
machines and new industrial pro
cesses that have been devised.
The conclusion that the prime 
cause of unemployment is the re
cent great technical advance is 
possibly true. But the possibility 
of error in the statement that 
members of the engineering pro
fession are solely to blame for our 
critical state must be admitted. If 
Mr. Casey had considered the mat
ter a little more, he might have 
concluded that the blame rests not 
necessarily upon the machines or 
the men who designed them, but 
perhaps upon those relatively few 
individuals who employ the tech
nical menthe so-called American 
industrialists. It is because of 
these advocates of the price sys
tem that the working force in 
practically every factory has been 
reduced steadily since 1918. Pro
duction, on the other hand, con
tinued to increase until 1929. Since 
October of that year, flooded mar
kets, low prices and crowded ware
houses have been common place. 
As fewer workers were to be paid 
while production rose, it is obvious 
that profits to. owners and opera
tors increased greatly. Yet, the 
wages of the men still fortunate 
enough to retain their positions 
had not been raised in proportion. 
Those men who had been displaced 
had their income cut off altogether.
Consequently, even though prices 
were slashed to unprecedented low 
levels, it was impossible that the 
great quantities of manufactured 
commodities could be consumed. 
The result was inevitablea com
plete breakdown of our industrial 
and economic system..
In an issue of a well known pe
riodical recently published, a sur
vey of present economic conditions 
in the United States, by E. Francis 
Brown, reveals facts that form a 
gloomy picture. One learns in 
reading it that, after a slight up
turn in September and October of 
the past year, during which busi
ness activity increased noticeably, 
it again suffered a steady decline.
Who is to take control and an
swer the demand for industrial 
leadership? Those men who are 
masters of the machine, who are 
familiar with industrial processes 
could aid immensely. How often 
does one hear the question: Where 
are our learned men in this crisis? 
They should be capable of getting 
to the root of our troubles and of 
formulating and leading the way 
to the time when any person will
ing to work will have employment. 
The prominent engineers, scien
tists and professors of engineering 
subjects in our colleges have the 
greatest opportunity to join in the 
work. It is their duty, when the 
time comes, to do everything in 
their power to aid in leading the 
country out of this impasse which 
is the result of an obviously misdi
rected industrial system.
and exert renewed effort. These 
are trying times and we can show 
our sincerity of purpose by contin
uing, determined that the weather 
at least shall not balk us in our 
effort to get an education.

I see that we have another type 
of ocracy added to the already 
growing list of ocracies. This time 
it is the tax question. The new 
term is taxocracy and everyone 
who pays taxes can become a 
member. This should include every 
individual since there are only 
two things ccimmon to the Ameri
can people, one is taxes, and the 
other is, well I dont have to tell 
you, you know.
Night Students Can Reg
ister for New Courses
Registration can be made during 
this week for the second semester. 
Several openings exist in the sub
jects taught at night and students 
can enter these courses as long as 
the quotas are unfilled.
By applying to the Registrar's 
office any night this week informa
tion may be obtained as to the pro
cedure of matriculating. The tui
tion rates are less for the semester 
than they would be for the full 
year so this should give an oppor
tunity to some niglit students to 
pursue some courses to make up 
for lost time.
Those night students who are al
ready registered, except in a very 
few subjects, are not required to 
re-register for the second semester 
as our system of registration in the 
night courses call for one registra
tion in most cases. However, if 
you have any acquaintances who 
are interested in the subjects of
fered on the campus at night you 
would do well to mention it to 
them that there are openings and 
have them come out for Informa
tion and interview at the registra
tion office in the Administration 
Hall.

Speaking of organization, I no

and I am sure some club or group 
is about to do some dirty work

Draws CriticismHave you heardThat was the 
worst exam I ever had, or The 
prof. turned the book loose on us 
just to show how much he knew, 
or I knew what he was driving 
at, but I failed to put it down, 
these and many other famous epi
taphs directed at the innocent in
structors are going the rounds 
now. I surely would like to be be
hind the doors to hear what the 
profs have to say about the papers. 
Cant conceive what their reaction 
would be like. Anyhow, the whole 
question of examinations is bunk 
to me. If I had my way, but I 
dont, I would put everyone on an 
even footing and then there would 
be no argument.
Everyone is asking, what are 
you going to use for money? 
Money ought to be a medium of ex
change, but it seems to have al
most lain down on the job. The 
banks are full of it, the big cor
porations have great reserves of it, 
millions of dollars are idle, Uncle 
Sam can borrow unlimited amounts 
of it for practically no interest, 
and yet, theres something wrong. 
Money is not circulating.
Money for the first time in his
tory, is out looking for work. But 
it cant find any. Strange, but 
true!
People are just beginning to rec
ognize the absurdity of the fact 
that, for instance, while there is 
an abundance of food stuffs in Qne 
section and an abundance of coal 
in another there seems to be no 
way for any two products of this 
sort to get together or make ex
changes. Coal can be bought In 
West Virginia for twenty-five cents 
a ton, and corn sells for twentyfive cents a bushel. A bushel of 
corn would exchange for a ton of 
coal at these starvation rates, sbut 
farmers are burning corn for fuel, 
not because it is good economy, 
but because its the best they can 
do.
The existence of sucli instances 
has brought many suggestions for 
new units of value to take the 
place of money. An English econ
omist has an elaborate plan for 
using wheat as the international 
specie of exchange. Our silver 
men are urging the use of silver 
along with gold, on the old Bryan 
basis of 16 to 1. Those silly tech
nocrats say the price system is a 
failure and that everything should 
be exchanged on a basis of the 
energy involvednamely, the num
ber of "ergs involved. The elec
tricity wizards argue that a better 
unit would be the kilowat.
Each person is apt to favor -as a 
unit the article he is most familiar 
with and most interested in. May
be the time will come when the 
words "dollars and cents will 
be forgotten and people will barter

I see that our congress has elim

perches. After this year those 
monstrosities will no longer be 
able to filibuster on their game 
legs. It does seem like a poor 
policy to have to wait thirteen 
months before a new group came 
into office. I suppose this death

Model Economic Disarmament Conferences
It ia proposed by the Intercollegiate Disarmament Council 
that model economic disarmament conferences he held on1 col
lege campuses this year to arouse student interest for the World 
Economic Conference to be held in London next spring. At a 
recent meeting of the council it was agreed that disarmament 
cannot be realized unless critical international economic prob
lems, such as tariffs and debts, are tackled first.
If the outcome of the World Economic Conference parallels 
that of most of the international conferences held in the past, it 
will be no surprise to the mildly interested an.d frequently 
cynical student. It is said that college students should be more 
interested in economic and governmental affairs and that more 
of them should prepare to enter politics. As a matter of fact, 
there is not much incentive for college trained men to enter 
politics, especially in the localities which are controlled by po
litical machines headed by i*aeketcers and greedy politicians.
The proposed student model economic disarmament confer
ences might do much to awaken student thought and animate 
student sentiment about important international problems, pro
vided the conferences are not controlled by propaganda groups 
not an uncommon situation in student conferences. Too often 
resolutions embodying sweeping statements are passed at such 
assemblages by sentimental students who are guided by impas
sioned moral rationalizing rather than sound economic and po
litical reasoning. When resolutions demanding total disarma
ment or total cancellation of war debts are born at conferences 
of college students who are supposedly representatives of stu
dent bodies and student thought, the people who have studied 
economics, government and politics, international banking and 
finance, and other related subjects and who have had their 
study flavored with tho pepper of experience will take little

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
Words, like their users, have 
biographies. Some o them are 
very Interesting; colorful, long, 
and vivid; others are dull, drab, 
and commonplacethey have a 
worn look about them, as IE they 
had experienced hard usage. Still, 
others have passed on, died, or 
become outmoded from long dis
use, and lies In the lexicograph
ers grave-yard with what corre
sponds to a Here lies," namely, 
the word obsolete.
The origin of some of our com
mon words, like that of ancient 
and well known heroes, Is found 
in myth and legend. For example, 
tho word amazou Is shouded In 
the mists of antiquity. Today, it 
means a tall, strong, masculine 
woman. It is derived from the 
name of those mythlogical vira
goes, tho Amazons. According to 
the1 traditions associated with 
these warlike women, In their 
hardihood they removed their right 
breast In order to facilitate the 
casting of their spears and the 
shooting of their arrows. The 
Greeks, from whose early litera
ture we have taken the word, 
fought with these feminine war
riors repeatedly; and in the ety
mology of the word we discover 
their description, "without breast 
from a meaning without. 
and mazon meaning breast. 
Through the ages the word lost its 
descriptive significance and took 
on an allied meaning, namely, 
one that characterized the temper
ament of the people to whom it 
was originally applied.
In like manner the life history 
of the very common word world 
originally spelled weorold 
which comeg from our own AngloSaxon language, contains that 
which is expressive of depth of 
meaning and wealth of association. 
Its etymological descent is from 
the union of the words wer 
like tho Latin virmeaning 
man and old meaning 
"aged. The combination of the 
two, the present world, tliereforce, means man-aged, and con
tains in Its richness of meaning 
what has beeii aptly expressed as 
the sum of human concerns. It 
Is the term that embodies man
kinds history, religion, art, and 
whatever else constituted the ac
tivities and thoughts of the races 
of men from the beginning. In this 
sense it Is obviously not synonym
ous with earth/ which describes 
lie globe in its planetary rela
tions.
Thus the lives of words,- their 
biographies; contain the record of 
their noble, or as often,-their low 
origin, their growth with usago, 
their survival. Often there Is 
beauty, and as often, sordidness. A 
study or them, especially of those 
expressive of mankinds most 
fundamental concepts, will repay 
even the most casual research.

Aftor yours of whining and weep
ing on tho part of tho Philippine 
Reprsentatives for freedom tho 
United States government has ar
ranged for the Islands to receive 
their Independence after ten or 
moro years. President Hoover votoed the bill when it was first pre
sented to him because lie could not 
see tho advisability of the Islands 
being free.
The independence bill provides 
for the writing of a constitution by 
a committee to be selected by a 
Philippine legislature. After the con
stitution has been drafted it must 
be submitted to the United Staes 
and approved by a majority vote, 
otherwise the Islands will continue 
in their present status. One of the 
provisions of the constitution must 
be a bill of rights. The president 
of the new government is to be 
directed to negotiate treaties witli 
foreign governments which will 
give the Philippines perpetual 
neutralization.
Ten years after the new govern
ment has been established under 
tho new constitution, the Unltod 
States will withdraw on the Fourth 
of July, thereby giving both na
tions tho same Independence day. 
As a token of good will, Congress 
has intimated that a reciprocal 
trado arrangement might bo worlcod out between tho United Statos 
and (ho Philippines boforo tho 
Islands receive their comploto independence.
It is vory difficult to prodlct 
what tho ultimate outoomo of tho 
situation will bo. Should tho Phil
ippines bo unable to establish a 
strong enough government to stand 
by itself, ovon aftor tho expiration 
of the ton yoar period, It Is vory 
doubtful If the United States would 
talto the clianco of allowing any 
other nation tho opportunity of 
snatching up as critical a parcel as 
the Philippines. Tho ontlro case ot 
Philippine independence is now in 
tho hands of the residents of Phil
ippines themsolves. It is up to them 
to make good.
aftor another. First l.hoy wore forced 
to call the flve-your plan to an un
timely end, and now tho Cossacks 
are rising against tho Soviet gov
ernment In open revolt. Tho 
governmental troops have suffer
ed defeat in almost every encount
er with tho rebels. Many of the 
Cossacks are trained soldiers who 
were at one time known for their 
valor in serving their leaders who 
often came from Russian nobility. 
At the time of tho revolution they 
broke away from the Imperial regi
ments as did many other soldiers. 
They live in the northern part of 
the Caucasian region. These re
volts were a direct result of the 
Soviets hording of the none too 
plentiful food supply. The de
mands of the Cossacks for food 
were refused and the Ogpu, or So
viet secret police, were sent to spy 
amongst them. Outraged at this 
treatment and in dire need of food, 
the Cossacks revolted. Right now 
the Soviet govenment is in a seri
ous position and needs all of the 
support it can get. It does not seem 
reaonable that a government 
which continues to spy upon the 
people in the nation which it rep
resents can ever have the faith of 
its citizens.
The Cossacks sprang to arms 
When they had no food to eat. 
Although the Soviet tried to win 
They went down in defeat.
TheSoviet government seems to 
be bumping into one misfortune
Adolf Hitler had a helper,
I-Ils name was Gregor Strasser. 
Financiers filled Adolfs coffer 
And out walked Mr. Strasser.
When Gregor Strasser left the 
ranks of Adolf Hitler, Herr Hitler 
lost the only man in his party who 
can talk clearly and coherently 
about economic relations. Ono of 
tho ehlof reasons for tho lift may 
have been due to the fadt tliat Hitlor has been roeoivlng largo sums 
of money from capitalistic sourcos 
to further his cause. Strasser be
lieved that the strength of his 
party was with tho middle class 
and small merchants. This would 
bo an anti-capitalistic attitude and 
would not quite ill. In with gifts 
given to Hitler by his new patrons, 
the financiers.
Gregor Strasser is much tho 
same typo of man as Stalin, who 
was such an important factor in 
Russia's revolutionizatlon. He has 
shown that lie desires to be one of 
the powers behind the Nazi throne. 
Since Hitler is vory much indebted 
to Strasser for the many favors 
done by the latter in his behalf, 
there is no doubt that Hitler will 
try to effect a reconciliation. Stras
ser will probably remain aloof un
til Hitler accepts his more radical 
and pro-Bolshevik attitude.

FjEMCE
FOR DEAR OLD DELTA SKULL
Last Monday night the jolly old Delta Skulls, 
heretofore known as the mens junior class hon
orary, had a meeting chiefly to decide what could 
be done about the Junior Prom,, but as is the 
custom at every Skull meeting year after year, 
the matter of the grand old habit of wearing 
dinks on Tues
days and Fri
days was also 
debated at 
great length. 
The results of 
this particular 
discus sion 
bore more 
fruit than 
usual, for the 
next noon hour found at least one dink in serv
ice. Jane Anderson was the only one observed 
sporting the terrifying skull and bones.
MR. BRUCE'S LATEST STAND
It all started at the basketball dance Friday 
night. Mr. Jack Bruce, the Campus Week sen
sation, furnished the music, and no one could 
recognize Thistle Hall with all the brand new 
spotlights scattered hither, thither and yon, cre
ating beautiful and brilliant effects. Of course, 
the basketeers were there in force. Bobby Smith 
and Sally Ochiltree, Lou Jagnow and Marion 
Baughman, Bradley Edelblut and a Miss Smith, 
Joe Milim, and Ed Stentz. To think, Jimmy 
.Leonard and Angus Fergus stag, both on the 
same night. The Senior Commercials once more 
in full force led by Hutchison and Liglitfoot.
Next night Mr. Bruce made his all that I am 
and all that I ever hope to be farewell from the 
platform and brought tear to the eyes of the 
stiff shirt and low back dancers. The speech was 
followed by the introduction of Junior Prom 
Slater to the assemblage. Mr: Slater in turn pre
sented Mr. Teddy Black (and if you think Its 
Guy your crazy, quoth he) by means of victrola 
records while the dancers closed their eyes and 
imagined they were up on the seventeenth floor 
of the Hotel William Penn.
Many of the boxers were on hand, led by 
Coach Sesto and Captain Carr, who by the way, 
gave a great exhibition of fast and furious foot 
work that even made "Toots Bailey blink in 
amazement.*****
OBSERVATIONS
Max I-Iannum at the microphone during the 
boxing bouts Saturday. Poor Max takes a drub
bing because of his hair or should we say lack of 
it? After the Geneva one point defeat, both Bill 
Farren and Ed Sprague commented on it. Just
like everything else, the scarcer it is the more 
its talked about.
Lots of pictures being taken in the labs of en
gineering students at work. Some of the boys 
have an awful job trying to look as if they, knew 
what it was all about.
John Kronenberg sitting in the hut with a con
tented look on his face reading Good Housekeep
ing. Is it as bad as that?
Becky Linn, one of a long line of Forbes Hall 
Linns, and famous for her bannister sliding epi
sodes, left the practice house for the peace and 
quiet of Mon City, while poor little Robby stagged it to both the big Jack Bruce dances.
Speaking of Robby naturally brings to mind 
Bill. Bill Informs us that his Puppet is going to 
carry a new scandal column for the fifst time in 
the next issue and also mentions that the author 
is probably the one person on the campus who 
gets all the dirt. The next issue is the true love 
issue. Jt ought to be good!
Johnny Lowes, after all these years, has final
ly g<me that way about a certain Maggie Murph 
plebe, and despite his earnest efforts, has failed 
to find out who she is. And the Junior Prom 
less than two weeks off.
Would you believe it? A certain young lady 
in Cedar Plall has a perfect horror of hearing 
electric light bulbs smash.*****

Few plays there are which after 
the final curtain leave with their 
audiences the deifying conviction 
that they have looked into the 
very lives and emotions of real 
people, rather than with the un
easy suspicion that they have wit
nessed mere puppets maneuver
ed according to the man-made plots 
of skilled dramatists. The De
partment of Drama presented one 
of these few plays In the Little 
Theater the first three days of 
last week: The Vultures by
Henri Becque.
The Vultures very markedly 
reflects the unusual personality of 
Its author. I-Ienrl Becque was ab
normally misanthropic; he took 
keen delight in making cruel at
tacks upon his colleagues and up
on humanity in general. I-Ils fail
ure to achieve success as a play
wright in a popular sense he atributed to the III will or persecu
tion of theatrical managers. As a 
rosult of his liate-filled, distrustful 
attitude his plays, of which lie 
wrote only seven or eight, were 
all attacks upon some subject 
which had chanced to arouse Ills 
antagprilsm.|
Written In 1S82, The Vultures 
assailed court procedure in 
France. At the rise of the curtain, 
M. Vigneron is found happily en
joying a few minutes of companion
ship with his family before leav
ing for his factory. The forced 
gaiety in celebration of the betro
thal' of one of the daughters, 
Blanche, is suddenly hushed.short
ly after Vignerons departure 
when he is carried in dead of apo
plexy. Mme Vigernon, distracted 
and incapable of protecting her 
own interests, is preyed upon by 
her unscrupulous lawyer abetted 
by M., Tessier, the sixty-year-old 
half-owner of the Vigeron factory. 
Tessier became anamored of the 
daughter, Marie, but she repulses 
him when lie makes dishonorable 
offers. Tessier, however, is very 
pleased with Maries shrewdness

in business matters. At . length 
Tessier proposes marriage to lier, 
and Marie finally accepts his offer 
to save her family from abject 
poverty.
The action of the play is hardly 
exciting as this summary shows. 
There Is not a sign, of color or a 
bit of the theatric to give it life 
just simple, hard realism, small 
souls rendered to perfection. Yet 
Mr. Sollers, who staged tills play, 
achieved a smooth, engaging pro
duction which compelled attention 
by its simple veracity and by the 
sincere, controlled emotion of its 
acting. The characters, devoid of 
honor or principle, were not inhu
man monsters, but villains so nat
ural and so unconscious that it 
seemed proper for them to conduct 
themselves as they did.
Thomas Gorman made his Vig
neron a gruff business man who 
expressed liis affection for his fam
ily in somewhat awkward jesting. 
Tessier, Vulture par excellence, 
was consistently and convincingly 
characterized by. RobertGill in 
one of his best performances of 
the year. Lefort, the architect, aB 
played by Barry ' Mulligan seemed 
to he too immature.
.Wan Dahl sustained and devel
oped the character of Mme Vigne
ron with nice restraint. Henriet
ta Siskin, as Marie, did a serious 
part with lier usual surenessex
cept in the first act. Blanche was 
played by a newcomer to the Little 
Theater programs, Mary Ann Mil
ler, in a Avay that gave promise.- 
Mrs. de' Saiut-Genls, stiff, cold, 
calculating, was just that in the 
hands of Suzanne Bennett. Mar
jorie. 'Eshelman, as Judith, display
ed a pleasing personality, but re
cited most of her lines.
The costuming, as usual, was ex
cellent.
The setting, representing a 
Parisian living room of 1882, was 
obtrusive because of its color, a 
characteristic unusual in Little 
Theater scenery. The - lighting, 
too, was definitely noticeable be
cause of the alternating bands of

Use of Models in Research Proves 
Many Accepted Theories Erroneous
In a talk before the Student 
Chapter of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers, R. W. Adams 33, 
Department of Civil Engineering, 
pointed out the necessity for the 
Use of models in solving compli
cated engineering problems. Sev
eral examples were cited, proving 
that the theory, particularly that 
concerning arch dams, is incorrect 
in several details.
One example given was that of 
the Calderwood Dam in Tennes
see; A model of this dam was 
constructed of specially de
signed rubber, and the be
havior of this model was 
compared with.that of the actual 
structure. This test brought out 
serious defects in the ordinary 
mathematical theory of arch dams, 
and will result in increased safety 
and economy in the design of fu
ture dams.
Further tests were made in the 
Hydraulic Research Laboratory at 
Carnegie concerning this same pro
ject. A model of the dam, as de
signed, was constructed in the 
testing flume. Tests concerning 
the Hydraulics of the project were 
carried on, which yielded informa
tion from which important changes 
in design were determined. These 
changes led to a safer design than 
that originally planned.
Further work carried on in the 
Hydraulic Research Flume con
sisted of tests run on the spill
way for the Chute a Caron project, 
one of the largest power projects, 
in the world, to determine the best 
design for a spray wall. This wall 
was necessary to protect the pow
er plant from damage due to the 
spray from the spillway. The 
model tests showed the most ef
ficient style of wall to use for this 
purpose. It would have been elmost impossible to solve this prob
lem by mathematical computations. 
Tests on the obelisk, the great 
dam which was built on#end and 
tipped into place, a part of this 
project, were also carried on here. 
From the information gained from 
these tests certain refinements of 
design and control were made pos
sible which could hot otherwise 
have been obtained. The action of 
the obelisk itself substantiated 
the results obtained by tests on 
the model.
Another model tested in the 
flume was that of the Ariel Dam 
near Portland, Oregon. The prob
lem here was to determine the 
most satisfactory type of spillway, 
one which would not wash the 
gravel, with which the valley 
abounded, back Into the power 
house. Tills problem was one 
which could not have been solved 
by computation, but which was 
solved very satisfactorily by this 
method. Here, again, the spill
way proved the truth of the results 
obtained from the model tests. It 
was in connection with this test 
that a student made a suggestion 
concerning the design which re
sulted in greatly improved condi
tions of flow.
The model which is in the 
flume at the present is that of the 
Flathead Dam. The problem here
is to test a new design of deflector 
at the base of the dam. The action 
of the water in this deflector is 
very complex, and'almost impossi
ble to predict by theory. The con
struction of this dam will convert 
hundreds of square miles of desert 
land into irrigated land, and it Is 
estimated that the model tests will 
enhance the safety and economy of 
the project.
Reference was also made to a 
great many other model tests, and: 
the economies made possible by 
each were pointed out. A signi
ficant quotation from John -R, 
Freeman, well known authority on 
Hydraulic Laboratory work, was 
given relative to one of the model 
testing laboratories in Europe. 
This to the effect that with each 
practical major problem that lied 
been taken from out-of-doors into 
their river-structure laboratory, 
the saving in structural cost due 
to the information thus gained had 
been more than equal to the en
tire cost ofthe laboratory build
ing, apparatus and research.

telephoneliome each week!
Think of the thrill it will give your Mother and Dad 
of the joy it will be to hear their voices each week! 
Its more than a substitute for cut-and-dried letters. 
A telephone chat with home is next best to being 
there.
Get the telephone habit. Its surprisingly inexpen
sive especially after 8:30 P. M. That is when low 
Night Rates go into effect on Station to Station calls. 
For 35 cents you can then call as far as 100 miles 
away!
To take advantage of the night-time reduction, be 
sure to make a Station to Station call. (Just give the 
home telephone number and do not ask the operator 
for any specific person.) If you like, of course, 
charges can be reversed.
