best booth of Spring Carnival 1962 
was awarded to Beta Theta Pi for 
its interpretation of Salem, Mas
sachusetts. Second place honors 
were given to Phi Kappa Theta, 
whose booth was inspired by the 
city of Moscow, and third place 
was taken by Tau Delta Phi, who 
chose Tokyo for its theme.
The Beta booth based its game 
on the Salem witch trials. Against 
the background oi an old Salem 
house, visitors to the booth at
tempted to prove the unfortunate 
Beta witches guilty by rolling a 
ball into a hole, lliose who suc
ceeded in proving their case got 
the long-awalied pleasure of 
watching the witch dunked into a 
tub of water, as well as a button 
stating I dunked a Beta.
The Phi Kap booth displayed a 
large revolving globe wtih a model 
city of Moscow in its center. Con
testants at this booth attempted 
to throw peace doves (badminston 
birdies) or war bombs (ping-pong 
balls) into the section of the city 
marked as Red Square.
Tau Delt modeled its booth after 
a Japanese style house. At the 
center of the house was a bridge 
which crossed over a goldfish 
pond. People stood on the bridge 
and tried to catch the fish by 
means of a net on the end of a 
long pole. The better fishermen 
were allowed to keep their catch.
Judging of the booths took place 
from 6:30 to 8:30 Thursday, May 
10. Winners were chosen for the 
effectiveness, appropriateness of 
theme, and design of their booth. 
Awards were announced on Sat
urday, May 12 at the Spring Car
nival dance.

ATOS Golden Goose tops hill 1
ATO Golden Goose Wins Again
The Spring Carnival Sweep
stakes, or just plain buggy races, 
were held this year in the midst 
of a great feeling of competition. 
Everyone was out to beat the 
perennial champ, the Golden 
Goose of ATO. The preliminaries 
were held last Friday with ATO, 
SAE, and PiKA qualifying for the 
finals the next day.
The final race was close until 
the free roll, where the Goose 
pulled far ahead. Coming up Frew 
Street though, the Shark of PiKA 
tightened up the race, but it was 
a lost cause. The Golden Goose 
won handily by fifteen yards with 
the Shark second and SAEs bi
cycle third.
In the design judging BTP took 
first place and ATO second.
The preliminary and final times 
were:
ATO 692:26.4

a bit of dirty playing and mud 
slinging, the Sigma Nus came 
through with their fifth consecu
tive victory at plank jousting. 
Phi Kappa Theta took second j 
place again this year. Plank 
Jousting consists of two contest
ants standing on a low, narrow 
board over a mud puddle aiming 
a mud soaked pillow at his op
ponent, trying to make him lose 
his balance. If one of the con
testants falls off, the victor must 
stay on the board for three sec
onds, or the contest is considered 
a draw.
The other teams participating 
were Theta Xi, Delta Upsilon, 
Beta Sigma Rho, Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon, Tau Delta Phi, Delta Tau 
Delta, Beta Theta Pi, and Alpha 
Tau Omega.
Also participating in the plank 
jousting were Chi Omega, Sigma 
Kappa and Kappa Alpha Theta, 
but they were not eligible for 
awards.

Women Sign As 
Big Sisters
Carnegie Tech women students 
who plan to be at Tech next year 
may sign up through the Y.W.C.A. 
to be an upper class sister to a 
freshman or transfer woman stu
dent. This program is designed to 
help incoming women students 
with their personal questions, to 
know that there is one specific 
person who is personally con
cerned that she feels at home on 
campus. It is not intended to take 
the functions of the dorm coun
selors or the academic counselors, 
but rather to supplement them. 
Upperclass girls are urged to 
write the freshman that is assign
ed to them during the summer, in
vite her to the Y Sister Tea the 
Sunday before registration, help 
her in the early days of the sem
ester and in whatever other way 
she can find that is useful. Ap
plications and collection envelopes 
are to be found in Margaret Mor

CRAM COURSE NO. 5: SHAKESPEARE
Continuing our series of pre-final exam cram courses, today we 
take up the works of William Shakespeare (or The Bard of 
Avon as he is jocularly called).
First let us examine the persistent theory that Shakespeare 
(or The Pearl of the Antilles as he is affectionately referred 
to) is not the real author of his plays. Advocates of this theory 
insist that the plays are so full of classical allusions and learned 
references that they couldnt possibly have been written by 
the son of an illiterate country butcher.
To which I reply, Faugh! Was not the great Spinozas 
father a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac 
Newtons father a simple second baseman? (The elder Newton, 
incidentally, is one of historys truly pathetic figures. He was, 
by all accounts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but 
baseball, alas, had not yet been invented.) It used to break 
young Isaacs heart to see his father get up every morning, put 
on uniform, spikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind 
second base, bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting, 
waiting. Thats allwaiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers 
and yelled, Good show, Dad! and stuff like that, but every
one else in town used to snigger and pelt the Newtons with 
overripe fruitfigs for the elder Newton, apples for the younger. 
Thus, as we all know, the famous occasion came about when 
Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his 
feet, shouted, Europa! and announced the third law of 
motion: For every action there is an opposite and equal 
reaction!
(How profoundly true these simple words are! Take, for 
example, Marlboro Cigarettes. Light one. Thats the action. 
Now what is the reaction? Pleasure, delight, contentment, cheer, 
and comfort! And why such a happy reaction? Because you have
rfid busebdlsb, Wwtyet hen me/fetf: 
started with a happy cigarettea felicitous blend of jolly to
baccos, a good-natured filter, a rollicking flip-top box, a merry 
soft pack. As Newton often said, You begin with better 
makins, you end with better smokins. Small wonder they 
called him The Swedish Nightingale!).
But I digress. Back to Shakespeare (or The Gem of the 
Ocean as he was ribaldly appelated).
Shakespeares most important play is, of course, Hamlet (or 
Macbeth, as it is sometimes called).,This play tells in living 
color the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night 
sees a ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he 
sees: I have a first folio edition that is frankly not too legible.) 
Anyhow, Hamlet is so upset by seeing the ghost (or goat) that 
he stabs Polonius and Bare Bodkin. He is thereupon banished 
to a leather factory by the King, who cries, Get thee to a 
tannery! Thereupon Ophelia refuses her food until Laertes 
shouts, Get thee to a beanery! Ophelia is so miffed that she 
chases hep little dog out of the room, crying, Out, out damned 
Spot! She is fined fifty shillings for swearing, but Portia, in 
an eloquent plea, gets the sentence commuted to life imprison
ment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen Mab proclaim a festi
val-complete with amateur theatricals, kissing ^ames, and a 
pie-eating contest. Everyone has a perfectly splendid time till 
Banquos ghost (or goat) shows up. This so unhinges Richard 
III that he drowns his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a 
lively discussion during which everyone is killed. The little dog 
Spot returns to utter the immortal curtain lines:
A lack, the play forsooth was sad and sobby,
But be of cheertheres Marlboros in the lobby!
C ,V62 Iax TbvD01*.
As the slings and arrows of outrageous finals loom closer, 
perchance the makers of Marlboro are not untoward to offer 
this friendly suggestion: Get thee to u library 1

If I Were President . . .
Faculty vs. Administrators
By Paul B. Farrell, Jr.
I never thought it would happen!
Last Tuesdays rebellion by a number of our faculty 
deserves a round of applause. Yes, applause! These men 
have earned my lasting respect and admiration.
Contrary to the timid belief of many of the conservative 
members on our payroll  these demonstrators deserve, not 
a reprimand, but praise! They have shown themselves 
worthy of the name educator!
This has been a growing concern of mine in recent years. 
The individual faculty member has become less a part of 
the university over the past decade, and, consequently, more 
a disinterested clock puncher with a so wrhat? attitude to
ward his colleagues and university.
It is evident that most members of our faculty have a 
secret fear of any public display of their ideas. How unaca
demic!
I suppose this timidity is a result of fear  fear of 
jeopardizing their promotion or tenure. How unacademic!
It is also a fear that the administration does not want 
controversy on the campus. How unacademic!
Such fear breeds selfishness  a lack of concern for the uni
versity or the faculty as a tangible entity. Such people are not 
professional educators, they have abdicated their professional re
sponsibilities!
These traits in our faculty are a disastrous contradiction. An 
educator must teach students and also continue to learn him
self. He does this by strict criticism of himself and his total environ
ment. This is a responsibility of his profession!
How strange it is that his university escapes such scrutiny by 
the faculty member. The center of a faculty members life he un
questionably accepts like a sheep! How unprofessional!
Worse yet, those who do question our educational policies have 
apparently been too squeamish to be publically vocal and too cow
ardly for positive action  rather fowl than faculty.
Kudos for the mutineers!
This is truly a turning point. We are now becoming a univer
sity, for our faculty are accepting a long neglected responsibility.
A true university has only two elements  the faculty and 
the students. There is no third party. Administrators can be neither 
educators nor dictators except to the destruction of the idea of the 
university!
Too many American faculties have passively relinquished the 
privilege of academic freedom. And they also only passively com
ment upon the unfortunate situation of administrators (who are 
actually non-educators) assuming control of the university. Well, 
someone has had to do the job that the faculty shirked!
This increasing selfishnes on the part of an individual faculty 
member toward the university has resulted in a dissolution of a 
bond within our faculty as a group. This decentralization is a failure 
in the faculty and a failure in the university.
A great university must be directed by its full time educator 
teachers!
Indeed, the integrity of a university depends upon the integrity 
of each member of the faculty to personally fulfill not only the 
narrow responsibilities of the classroom, but the larger responsibili
ties of guiding the philosophy of the university. This means action  
public action!
This revolt is most amazing to me because I can not under
stand why nothing has been done before this action. No matter, 
the tide is turned, and my heart fired to see our faculty stand 
firm on their feet and demand the responsibility of establishing 
educational policy at Carnegie University. A university must be 
active  and action we have seen!
Henceforth, then, Carnegie University will have a Faculty 
Senate composed of full time instructors and professors who will 
have control and responsibility of academic affairs. The academic 
vice president will serve under their direction.
In the future, I hope to see more expressions of opinion and 
belief on the part of our faculty, and I know our recently grown 
conservative students will follow and their education benefit.
This then is what a university must be  a group of scholars 
and students who continually analyze and criticize their total en
vironmentand then express this criticism positively and publically 
in words and actions.
A university must be non conformist, unconventional, contro
versial, critical, and a creator of problems for a society which con
tinually grows complacent.
Gentlemen of the faculty  my applause  we will now 
have a university because you are willing to accept your responsi
bility as educators.

New Approach To Pledge Policy; 
Merits Of Present Policy Debated
EDITOR'S NOTE: The following 
is a copy of a report given to the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
through its Committee On Pledge 
Training. C.F.P. requests that it 
be published in an attempt to 
inform the campus community as 
to what steps are being taken in 
Tech fraternity system to elimin
ate older, time-worn methods, 
replacing them with newer, more 
radical concepts of fraternity 
living.
A fraternity on the Carnegie 
Tech campus recently completed 
a "final orientation week for its 
pledges which is felt will help 
give direction to the new pur
poses and goals of this fraternity 
and to the Tech fraternity sys
tem as a whole. It is further felt 
that the publication and wide
spread discussion that this hell 
week will stimulate and be very 
benificial to these goals. First, it 
will allow the different groups 
on campus to be enlightened as 
to what is being done and what 
directions are being adopted in 
our fraternity system. Second, it 
will encourage debates as to the 
merit of such directions by other 
members of the system, possibly 
resulting in an examination of 
their philosophies and practices. 
This will mean that those who 
encourage the old type hell 
week along with physical hazing 
will have to defend their position 
01 re-evaluate it.
Ln contrast to the weeks held 
previously, this period was seen 
as a chance to introduce these 
men to the problems and new 
directions of the fraternity sys
tem, rather than firing them with 
philosophy of the week that 
pledging is to make good actives, 
not good pledges.
It was attempted to get up 
what was considered an ideal 
week filled with discussion, selfenlightment, and much learning 
on both sides. The topics discussed 
were first attacked on the level of 
life in general, .its goals and 
purposes; then funneled down to 
college and its role; and finally 
applied to fraternity and its 
meaning. Whenever possible, tc.- 
ics were discussed on their broad
est level before applying them to 
the immediate present. An exam
ple is the discussion on capital 
punishment which, after a 
healthy debate, turned into a 
discussion of the merit of pun
ishment and fines as a corrective 
measure in the fraternity house.
It might be pointed out here 
that the intent of the discussions 
was not to find an answei and
decide whether capital punishishment is right or wrong, but 
rather to stimulate thinking on 
this and related topics. A discus
sion on Birth Control proved 
to be very good along this line, 
as it was discussed very intelli
gently and stimulated probably 
the most interest of the week. 
Many pledges were happy to hear 
the opinions of their pledge 
brothers, and also to see that 
they had an open mind that 
would allow this to be discussed 
so frankly. Other such philosophi
cal and ideal-provoking discus
sions were Goals and Purposes 
in Life and The Aftermath of 
a Nuclear Attack. More realis
tic, yet informative, talks includ
ed the discussions of the chapter 
constitution and the possibilities 
and importance of chapter public 
relations.
Similar to these discussions was 
the brainstorming of local prob
lems, the purpose of which again 
was not so much for the value of 
the solutions suggested (although 
many turned out to be worth
while) but rather to make the.n 
feel that their ideas are welcomed 
and their opinions respected and 
to make them aware of these 
problems. Such problems were 
presented as House Mainten
ance, Pledge Training, Im
mediate Rushing. and Party 
Ideas. It was seen that by ex
amining the problems of house 
maintenance, for example that 
there was an immediate reaction 
to keep the house cleaner on the 
part of the individual. Also by 
discussing party ideas it was 
found that the spirit of the in
dividuals was heightened and 
that their interest and excite
ment for future activities was 
sparked.
Oecassionally after dinner cer
tain pledges were asked to give 
five minute, impromptu talks on 
assigned topics. This proved in
teresting to the audience of 
brothers and also gave the pledges 
experience in this type of ex
pression.
At the beginning of the week 
research topics were assigned 
each pledge to report on at speci
fied times during the week. It 
was felt that an individual could 
learn a great deal more by study
ing problem areas that are close 
to him, rather than being lec
tured to on the good and b * 
habits in these areas. In addition 
to the knowledge gained by their 
own research they were able to 
trade ideas through the reports 
of their pledge brothers. Topics
studied include: Communication 
of Ideas, Personal Hygiene and 
Sex Education, Proper Ward
robe, Nutrition, and Table 
Etiquette.
Since this week involved a 
new philosophy of pledge train
ing it was also felt that the 
pledges should feel proud of their 
fraternity praticipation and should 
display it, rather than be ashamed 
to let any outsiders view the 
proceedings. For this reason all 
social and fraternity events were 
held as usual, including the visit 
of a sorority pledge class for din
ner. Also to favoralby publicise 
the proceedings and for training 
reasons, the pledges were re
quired to be neat all day, wear 
coats and ties to class, and shave 
and shower every morning.
Furthermore, it was attempted 
to have the pledges utilize their 
time more efficiently by encour
aging them to study during free 
hours and have every minute 
serve some purpose, even if for 
relaxation. It was found that with 
abundant time allowed for studies 
and with the time taken out for 
the events of the week (discus
sions, research, etc.) there was 
still time for each man to re
ceive at least six hours sleep per 
night. This seemed to be an ob
vious stipulation since a man 
could not take advantage of the 
events planned for the week un
less he was rested and alert. Al
so this factor erased the constant 
criticism of faculty members 
towards such pledging practices, 
as did the rule that no cutting 
of classes would be tolerated.
In general it is felt that_ the 
repitition of such a week (with 
minor problems ironed out) will 
have a very positive and lasting 
effect in introducing a man to 
four years of fraternity life. Need
less to say, this program met 
with some opposition from the 
members of the house that tried 
it. This is inevitable with any
thing new and controversial, es
pecially something that contra
dicts that which has become tra
dition over so many years. How
ever, it is hoped that this pro
gram will be acknowledged and 
discussed and possibly experi
mented with in every house on 
campus, so that the systems ideals 
and recently evaluated purposes 
will become reality.
Only with the sincere effort of 
the members of the Tech frater
nity system will this goal be at
tained. Then, perhaps, this sys
tem will be the first to lead the 
college fraternity into a meaning
ful position on every college cam
pus.

Editor, the Tartan:
Probably the only tradition re

Recently, I went for a swim 
in said pond (quite unwilling) 
and upon righting myself in the 
water (?), I discovered I was 
standing up to my knees in mud.
While attempting to clear a path 
through the derbis blocking my

effective mass demonstrations 
against apathy the campus has 
seen in a long time. At the final 
performance of Scotch n Sodas 
Viv I saw exhibited such en
thusiasm and dedication to task 
that I began to wonder how, just 
^one year ago, the main topic of 
discussion in these columns was 
student apathy and the demise 
of extra-curricular activities.
It was indeed reassuring to 
sit with an audience that was 
similarly enthusiastic in its re
sponses and to observe what was 
probably the most spirited and 
well prepared production Scotch 
n Soda has ever brought forth. 
Every member of the cast and

At the meeting of Student Con

the revision of the constitution 
was passed. Also, the motion con
cerning a new parking program 
was approved. The motion stated 
that At registration before each

ter will be given the opporunity 
to purchase, at a nominal fee, a 
sticker or identification of some 
form permitting the holder to park 
his automobile on specified campusowned lots provided the lots 
are not filled. This permit, therefore, provides the holder with the 
right to park on specified cam

space to any permit holder. It is 
to be understood at the time of 
purchase that the permit provides 
only the opportunity to search on

of permits sold is not to be limited 
to the number of available spaces.
Be it further mo'ed that Stu

has been most rewarding, and 
the program will continue for

S n S Earns Profit And Raise;
Selects New Board After Viv
In playing before two capacity 
houses  Wednesday and Thurs
day  Scotch N Soda presented 
what has been generally acknowl
edged as the best show in at least 
three years. Some long-time mem
bers of the faculty have even said 
ten years.
It was a great, fulfillment to the 
more than 100 students who 
wholeheartedly dedicated them 
selves to proving to the administratin and students of Carnegie 
Tech two things: Of primary im
portance was Scotch n Sodas per
ennial financial problem. It was 
made known to the Board in the 
beginning of the year that at least 
breaking even was imperative. In 
the April 11 issue of the Tartan, 
Business Manager R. J. Levinson, 
speaking for the Club, vowed that 
Viv would produce a profit.
Working on a budget that was 
half of what had been lost (let 
alone spent) last year, the club 
carefully planned where every 
cent would go. All unnecessary 
publicity, extravagant sets and 
costumes, etc., were eliminated 
completely. Maximum use was 
made of previous supplies, and all 
work was done by Club members. 
The result: despite a reduced
theater size, and despite some still 
existing apathy, a profit of nearly 
$500.
The front page headline of the 
Tartan on February 28 was, 
Scotch n Soda Predicts An Out
standing Production. This S n S 
has also lived up to. The many 
members of the faculties of the 
English, Music and Drama De
partment who saw Viv are very 
much in agreement that it was a 
fine college musical.
Helping to make it just that  
an amateur college musical were 
the special surpi'ise guests each 
night. A different well-known 
professor played the one-line of 
Howard Hotchkiss on each of 
the successive (and successful) 
nights. They were: Professors
Robert Schwarz of Historj7, Rob
ert Lepper of Painting, Design and 
Sculpture, Hugh Young of Physics, 
and Beekman D. Cottrell of 
English.
The end of Thursdays perform
ance brought tears and embraces 
from many of the people in the 
show. For everyone it was hard to 
believe that Viv was over. No 
one wanted it that way. For near
ly everyone  including Faculty 
Advisor Jim DeBlasis  it was 
the most enjoyable, most fulfill
ing experience of their lives.
But there was still a lot to be 
done. With the show over, every
thing had to be dismantled and 
returned to its place. Technical 
Director Ed Kant estimated that 
strike night would last until 
about 5:30 a.m. But the same 
teamwork that produced Viv 
was still evident in taking her 
apart. The night ended at 3:30.
At 1:30 a.m. everyone took a 
break. At this time traditionally 
the new Board of Directors of 
Scotch n Soda is announced. Pre
ceding the announcement, the 
President Stu Warshawaky pre
sented Faculty Advisor Jim De
Blasis with a gift. With contribu
tions from everyone in the Club, 
a savings bond for his three-yearold daughter was purchased. Any 
bond would be much to express 
the Clubs gratitude.
Each year the Board of Scotch 
*n Soda selects its successors. To
fill the shoes of the outgoing 
Board will be difficult. But they 
do feel confident in their choices, 
and believe that they will carry 
on strongly the new tradition be
gun this year.
Two changes in the nature of 
Board memberships were made 
last fall with the adoption of a 
new constitution. The Secretary to 
the Board is now a voting mem
ber, and there has been added an 
Advisory Board  non-v o t i n g 
members whose technical know
how and advice is invaluable to 
the Boards decision making.
Succeeding Stu Warshawsky as 
President is Regina Ress, only a 
sophomore. She has been with the 
Club two years as a cast member, 
and served this past year on the 
Board. She was the unanimous 
choice of the outgoing Board.
Vice-President for next year, 
following Pat Moore, is Lois 
Crcco, a junior Business Studies 
Major. She has served faithfully 
for three years. She has worked 
hard at anything she has been 
asked to do, and she has served on 
the Board thsi past year. She has 
been invaluable on costume and 
curtain crews.
Drama Representative is Dean 
Brown, one of this years co-writ
ers, and the costume designer. 
Also from the Drama Department 
is Dinah Mathias, who has been 
choreographer for two years. 
Both are juniors.
Cast representatives are Shelley 
Kaplan and Carol Haber. Shelley, 
a junior P&D has been a cast 
member for three years, while 
Carol, a sophomore humanities 
major boasts two years of cast ex
perience. Shelley was seen this 
year in the role of Seymour and
Carole was in the chorus.
Sue Flip Gronich, this years 
paint crew head, has been ap
pointed as the painting represen
tative. She is a junior P&D.
Wendy Bers, a sophomore Busi
ness Studies, major, assumes the 
new position of Secretary. She has 
been in the cast two years, this 
year in the chorus and on the 
board.
Fortunately the Board was able 
to find four talented freshmen, 
three of whom will be filling key 
positions. Erroll Butch Davis, 
freshman Physics, will succeed R. 
J. Levinson as Business Manager. 
This year he was Ticket Manager.
Richard Elkman will succeed 
Richard Pressman as Publicity Di
rector. This year he worked on the 
program Booklet. Richard is al
ready well known for his efforts 
with the Carnegie Ceiledh and 
several other organizations.
Succeeding the very large shoes 
of Dave Stock will be Richard 
Moore as music representative. A 
freshman music major, he was 
seen this year in the role of 
Scotty Buzzell.
Rounding out the Board is 
freshman General Studies major, 
Jean Renaud. This year she served 
as Stage Manager, which is quite 
an accomplishment for a fresh
man. But she proved to be highly 
efficient in her vital job, and the 
outgoing Board believes her to be 
one of the strongest new members 
of a very strong new Board.
Two invaluable people have 
been appointed to the newly cre
ated Advisory Board. They are Ed 
Kant and Bill Boag. Ed, a junior 
chemical engineer, was this years 
Technical Director. Bill, a junior 
EE, was head of Lighting Crew.

For the second consecutive year,

the new champions with a throw

Jim Deblasis, faculty advisor of 
Scotch n Soda, started the work 
on Viv and did much to keep 1 
the driving force behind it. Al! 
though he modestly decrys all j 
credit, he was the unifying force 
that inspired the whole club to 
produce the spectacular results 
that the campus enjoyed. He went 
to the Board of Directors with the 
problems of finances and Tech 
apathy towards Scotch n Soda. 
The Board realized the problems 
involved to stand behind Jim in 
anything he asked. Working long 
hours on jobs that they were not 
required to do, the Board pre
pared the way for Viv. Next 
the cast joined the fight to prove
to Tech that students could, on 
their own, produce a good, origiral musical comedy and make a 
profit. After long hours of re
hearsal, the cast was willing to 
I help on crew. When the final,
| hectic push of the last few weeks 
came, some of the cast did join 
the greatly undermanned crew of 
the all-night work sessions. The 
crew mounted what seemed in
surmountable problems that they 
faced using the ballroom and the 
new stage. Equipment was begged 
or borrowed, not bought thanks 
to the profit-minded R. J. Levin
son, from Pittsburgh and sur
rounding area. Then the job of or
ganizing it and the new crew fell
to the loud, capable technical di
rector, Ed Kant. Armed with a 
bullwhip and a banana, Ed swung 
from the scaffold until the work 
was done. For weeks before the 
opening of Viv, he could be 
found on the right hand of Jim 
DeBlasis every night, all night at 
work sessions. Many others, too 
numerous to name, could also be 
found in Skibo ballroom almost 
all of the time. Bill Boag, a trans
fer student from Ohio Wesleyan 
and a Sigma Nu, was the dedi
cated head of the lighting crew 
who worked with a crew entirely 
composed of novices, none of 
which were listed in the program. 
His endeavors earned him an honorary position on the board. An
other person deserving of recogni
tion is Bob Dappaort, head of 
running crew. Bob came from that 
big dirty sky scraper known as 
Pitt to help the understaffed pro
duction. Jean Renaud, a fresh
man,put her wholehearted atten
tion on her immense job as Stage 
Manager and proved to be one of 
the best workers Scotch n Soda 
has had in years. She also did 
much to unite the crew and cast. 
After months of grind at their 
own jobs, the cast, Board, and 
faculty advisor helped the crew 
above and beyond their call of 
duty in the last few weeks to give 
Tech a show to be proud of.Get Lucky
the taste to start with...the taste to stay with
What makes Lucky Strike the favorite regular cigarette of college smokers? Fine-tobacco taste. 
The taste of a Lucky is great to start with, and it spoils you for other cigarettes. Thats why

The Tech track squad, after be
ing edged by Westminster for its 
fourth loss, bounced back into the 
victory column with a convincing 
win over Waynesburg, to give the 
team a five and four record.
The Westminster meet was a 
battle down to the wire, with 
neither team sure of victory until 
the end of the last event. As 
usual, Tech eked out more first 
places than the opposition, but the 
superior depth of the Titans gave 
them a 68-63 win.
Andy Niedra turned in an ex
cellent performance in the 880 
with a time of 1:59.8, easily beat
ing Pekich of Westminst , last 
years WPC 880 champ Tony 
Williams came very close to the 
schol record in the pole-vault 
with a valid jump of 124. Wil
liams went 128 on an unofficial 
jump to top the school mark, 
though it cannot be recognized.
The mile-relay team of Niedra, 
Tom Terpack, Hank Werronen, 
and Dennis Gary won with a good 
time of 3:32.2, their best of the 
season.
In the Waynesburg meet, the 
Tartans took an early lead and 
held it to eabt a highly-improved 
Yellow-Jacket squad, 78V2 to 51^. 
The meet produced no outstand
ing exhibitions, but was a good 
team showing. The Waynesburg
track, a 370 yard oval, did not 
lend itself to record breaking ef
forts.
This Friday and Saturday, the 
West Penn Conference champion
ship track meet will be held at 
the Tech Field oval. Though 
Techs record in the WPC this 
year was a disappointing 2-3, the 
Tartans have an excellent chance 
to walk away with the first place 
trophy. CIT was beaten by very 
narrow margins by Grove City, 
and Westminster. In the WPC 
meet, however, Tech will be in 
the thick of the race for the cham
pionship with these three teams. 
Waynesburg and St. Francis, the 
other two WPC schoools with 
track, are not likely to offer much 
competition.
Dennis Gary, in the sprints; 
Andy Niedra, in the 880; Tony 
Williams, in the pole-vault; Bob 
Diskin, in the broadjump: Jim 
Sharkey, in the high-jump; Jon 
Borofsky, in the shot: Mike Camp
bell, in the two-miel; and the 
mile-relay team all have excel
lent chances to take first place 
medals.
Anyone interested in seeing a 
good track meet is invited to take 
in the WPC meet at the Tech 
Field Oval. Admission is free, 
and the meet begins at 1:30, this 
coming Saturday.
