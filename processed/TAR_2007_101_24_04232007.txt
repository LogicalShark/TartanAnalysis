Virginia Tech massacre
Mellon explains how its keepmg camjjp safe
by Sarah Mogin
Pillbox Editor
Wednesday night, students 
and faculty gathered by the 
Fence. In the midst of the cold 
and windy weather, 70 hands 
cupped 70 flickering flames as 
the Carnegie Mellon commu
nity mourned the victims of the 
Virginia Tech massacre.
Last Monday, 23-year-old Vir
ginia Tech student Seung-Hui 
Cho killed himself and 32 oth
ers in the deadliest shooting 
executed by a single person in 
United States history. The at
tacks occurred in a dormitory 
and an academic building, both 
located on the Virginia Tech 
campus.'
The vigil by the Fence is only 
one example of the ways in 
which colleges and universities 
nationwide are coming together 
to honor those slain.
Students totally took the lead 
on creating this opportunity to 
express themselves after the
ViraMteapTech shootings, said'li 
Jonafnan Kroll, honsefellow for * 
Morewood Gardens. I think it 
definitely helps writh the griev
ing process.
The vig i 1 bega n at 9 p.m. wi t h a 
moment of silence. As the group 
grew in number, participants 
continued to light the candles ? 
of those who gathered along the 
periphery of the crowd.

Carnegie Mellon purchases Holiday bar; plans to knock it down in June
Foreign grad applications 
to U.S. schools increase
by Sabrina Porter
Assistant News Editor
For many foreign graduate 
students, the campuses of Amer
ican universities have become 
their new backyards. According 
to the April 2007 figures from 
the Council of Graduate Schools 
(CGS), foreign graduate applica
tions to American universities 
are continuing their upward 
trend.
The CGS findings are part of 
an annual three-part survey 
that measures international 
applications, admissions and 
enrollments. The number of in
ternational student applications 
for the fall 2007 semester rose 
by eight percent, following a, 12 
percent gain last year.
The CGS obtained responses 
for the third consecutive year 
from 145 schools, eight of 
which are among the 10 schools 
with the largest international 
populations.
The CGS is a nonprofit 
coalition composed of colleges 
and universities that together 
annually award more than 95 
percent of all U.S. doctorate and
85 percent of all U.S. masters 
degrees.
However, while numbers con
tinue to increase, the growth 
rate has started to level out; ap
plications are growing, but by 
less and less each year.
The largest number of appli
cations the study ever recorded 
was in 2004, in its inaugural 
survey. This year marks the 
third consecutive year where 
the growth rate has decreased. 
Currently, the growth rate is 
down nearly 20 percent from 
the year 2003, when institu
tional estimates placed the rate 
at 25 percent.
It all goes back to economics, 
said Ling-Fong Li, Director of the 
Carnegie Mellon physics Gradu
ate Program. As more and more 
countries develop their econo
mies, less of their students will 
come to the United States for an 
experience they cannot find in 
their own country.

graduate students in the Phys
ics Department has fluctuated

The decades-old bar Holiday, located near Forbes Avenue and Craig Street, will be demolished in June.
by Cecilia Westbrook
Junior Staffwriter
After more than half a century 
of history, on April 29 the land
mark bar Holiday is closing its 
doors for good. Carnegie Mellon 
purchased the building and will 
demolish it in June.
Once one of very few gay bars 
in Pittsburgh, Holiday has long 
been a nexus for the gay commu
nity, both as a night spot and as 
an active contributor to charities 
focused on gay welfare.
The bar is located just down 
Forbes Avenue from Hamburg 
Hall.
Aside from Holidays gay affili
ation, the bar has become known 
to patrons both gay and straight 
as just a nice place to hang out. 
A number of the patrons are female Carnegie Mellon students 
who want a break from the 
. dating-oriented bar scene.
Its the perfect place to go 
when youve just dumped some
body or been dumped, said 
Genevieve Barbee, a senior art 
major. You get to be surrounded 
by men, but theres no pressure. 
Barbee, who is also a bar
tender at the Panther Hollow Inn 
(PHI), said she started going to 
Holiday because it was across the 
street and afforded a change in 
atmosphere.
I still love PHI bar, but its 
more college-oriented. Holidays 
clientele are older and just want 
to relax, she said.
In the 1950s, the bar was a 
beatnik coffee shop frequented 
by Andy Warhol. In fact, a mural 
on one of the walls inside was 
commonly attributed to Warhol
for a number of years. Last year, 
the bar owners discovered that 
it was actually painted by David 
Byrd, another Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus and acquaintance of 
Warhol, as a tribute to the artist.
Holiday became a gay bar in the 
1960s. Despite changing owner
ship several times since then, it 
has remained an important part 
of the gay community. The bars 
current owners, Chuck Honse 
and Chuck Tierney, bought the 
business in 1977.
Back then there werent that 
many gay bars, and this was the 
best one, Honse said. Many of 
the bars clientele are longtime 
patrons, old faces who know the 
owners.
Holiday was also a major re
cruiter for the Pitt Mens Study,

Suspicious package causes chaos on campus

A suspicious package was iden
tified Thursday afternoon on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus behind 
Hamburg Hall. The package, a 
three-foot-tall silver and green 
metal cylinder, was spotted by 
another student in the backseat 
of a white Toyota Echo belonging 
to Joel E. Chestnutt, a Ph.D. can
didate in philosophy. The student 
immediately called 911.
At about 12:30 p.m., a car be
longing to the Pittsburgh Bureau 
of Police chased the suspicious 
vehicle into the Forbes Avenue 
driveway and pulled it over in 
front of Newell-Simon Hall. 
Shortly thereafter, several un
marked police cars barricaded the 
suspicious vehicle in front of the 
Collaborative Innovation Center.
The university did not issue an 
official evacuation notification, 
but police briefly locked down the 
campus while they conducted an 
investigation.
The Allegheny County Bomb 
Squad, the Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Police, Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity Police, and University of Pitts
burgh Police were all present on
the scene.
The bomb squad investigated 
the package and confirmed that 
it was a facsimile of a weapon of 
mass destruction. Though the 
squad declared the package harm
less, the squad also checked the 
interior of Hamburg Hall and used 
bomb-sniffing dogs to ensure that 
there were no hidden bombs in 
the area.
Chestnutt was arrested by the 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and 
charged with disorderly conduct 
and possession of a facsimile of a 
weapon of mass destruction. He 
faces a preliminary hearing on 
Thursday.
Students on the walkway 
between the Collaborative Inno
vation Center (CIC) and Hamburg 
Hall were detained inside the CIC, 
according to a student. The stu
dent and her co-worker were only 
able to exit the building when an 
employee of the CIC showed them 
how to exit the building through 
the garage.
Police also rerouted traffic on 
Forbes Avenue between Craig 
Street and Morewood Avenue.
At about 2:20 p.m., Police con
firmed that the bomb threat was 
negative and cleared the area.
University Police declined to 
comment on the situation.
Officials investigate a suspicious package found behind Hamburg Hall.

E&S and Hunt libraries will 
undergo changes this summer
Starting this summer, all 
books in the Engineering & 
Science and Hunt libraries 
will be renumbered to convert 
them from Dewey Decimal 
Classification system to Library 
of Congress Classification 
(LCC).
This change has already 
taken place in libraries of the 
Mellon Institute, Qatar, and 
the Software Engineering 
Institute.
The upcoming reclassifica
tion will affect about 500,000 
books among the two libraries.
The changes will allow the 
Carnegie Mellon library sys
tem to translate easily into
other academic environments. 
Once students and faculty 
learn the system, they will be 
able to use the same skills in 
other libraries, making it eas
ier to perform research.
Library staff will deliver 
ongoing project updates via 
campus media, in the librar
ies, and on the University 
Libraries website at 
www.library. emu. edu.

Carnegie Mellon students are 
richer and more qualified than 
ever before, according to a new 
survey. They are also more ambi
tious, applying to more schools, 
and are less likely to have ap
plied to Carnegie Mellon as their 
first choice.
These are only some of the 
conclusions about higher edu
cation gleaned from American 
Freshmen: Forty-Year Trends
1966-2006, the results of a 
survey administered to each 
entering class for the past 40 
years at hundreds of colleges 
and universities nationwide.
The study, released April 9, 
was part of the Cooperative In
stitutional Research Program 
(CIRP), run by the Higher Educa
tion Research Institute at UCLA. 
It aimed to document the char
acteristics and values of college 
first-years on both national and 
local levels by asking students 
about family finances; study 
habits; social and academic per
formance in high school; life 
goals; political, religious, and 
racial ideologies; and reasons for 
attending college.
Weve been participating 
since the 1960s, said Stacey 
Lopez, the director of Carnegie 
Mellons Institutional Research 
and Analysis, of the survey. Each 
year, 80 to 90 percent of Carn
egie Mellon first-year students 
complete the survey during Ori
entation, she said.
Now, officials can see the
results of 40 years worth of la
bor  and finally receive some 
answers to some of higher edu
cations touchiest questions.
In 2006, nearly 70 percent of 
Carnegie Mellon students esti
mated their parents total annual 
income at $75,000 or more, ac
cording to the CIRP report. This 
is well above the national me
dian of $46,326. In 1971, college 
families made only 46 percent 
more than the national median 
average.
Education is a really strange 
business. Why do we do all this 
studying? Because we think it 
is good for society. What are 
we doing if only the richest kids 
can pay to come, though? said 
Indira Nair, the vice provost for 
education.
I dont think we have truly
poor kids anymore, Nair said.
These figures matched those 
of colleges nationwide. Over
all, the median parental income 
for entering first-years in 2005 
was $74,000, 60 percent higher 
than the national average, ac
cording to a press release from 
the Higher Education Research 
Institute.
My concern is that were 
going back to a time when edu
cation was more for the elite, 
said Susan Ambrose, the associ
ate provost for education and a 
teaching professor in the history 
department.
In its gradual transition away 
from being a regional workingclass institution since the turn 
of the century, Carnegie Mellon 
has attracted a more geographi
cally diverse student body. In 
1975, Carnegie Mellon was 
within 500 miles of homes for 
approximately 80 percent of its 
students; now, 80 percent hail 
from 100 miles away or more, 
including 40 percent who reside 
over 500 miles away.
Its been a mixed blessing 
for Carnegies dream for a true 
working-class institution, Nair 
said.
Fifty-four percent of Carnegie 
Mellon students reported that 
developing a meaningful philos
ophy of life was a very important 
aspect of their education, more 
than 15 percent fewer than in 
1975. The survey put the national average for this figure at 
44 percent.
When youre technological 
and product-oriented, philosoph
ical discussions probably do not 
seem as necessary, Nair said.
To promote this kind of discu
sin, the university is considering 
an initiative to implement peri
odic faculty-led philosophical 
discussions in first-year resi
dence halls, she said. Fifty-eight 
faculty members showed up for 
a meeting regarding the discus
sions, which would be moderated 
on a volunteer basis.
The study showed that while 
students are more qualified and 
higher-performing than ever be
fore, more want academic help 
and support. In 2006, 75 percent 
of Carnegie Mellon students 
reported that they typically re
ceived As in high school, a 35 
percent increase since 1975.
Nevertheless, Academic De
velopments tutoring programs 
are overwhelmed with requests, 
according to Ambrose.
More people are reporting 
learning disabilities. The provost 
has increased the resources for 
[tutoring] programs, [but] still 
not enough to meet demand. The 
hard question is, what skills are 
students without when they come 
into college? Ambrose said.
A lot of people say its the 
high-stakes testing becoming

Popular entertainer Bill Cosby 
has accepted Carnegie Mellons 
invitation to deliver the keynote 
address at this years commence
ment, to be held on Sunday, May 
20.
Cosby is a popular speaker 
and a Pennsylvanian, which 
makes him an interesting choice 
for Carnegie Mellon, said Teresa 
Thomas, assistant vice president 
for media relations.
The university strives to 
choose a keynote speaker who 
reflects the attitudes and prefer
ences of the entire student body.
Ideas are solicited from the 
campus community, and from 
those ideas a speaker is selected 
and invited, Thomas said.
Student responses to this 
years decision were overwhelm
ingly positive.
Hes Cosby. Everyone loves 
him, said Karl Sjogren, student 
body president and a senior 
social and decision sciences 
major. I think Cosby will be a 
great keynote speaker. Hell be 
able to deliver a humorous, in
sightful, and well-intentioned 
commencement address to be 
remembered.
Sjogren and fellow students 
were excited at the prospect of a 
big name speaker on campus.
Cosby is an international 
name; his speech is not some
thing to be taken lightly, 
Sjogren said. Furthermore, the 
university has now set a very 
high standard for who a com
mencement, speaker should be.
I think its awesome Carnegie 
Mellon is getting more and more 
famous speakers. It reflects on 
our school and the recognition 
as more than just an engineer
ing school, said Amrut-Pati, a 
senior chemistry major. Its a 
real positive for our school and 
students. Bill Cosby is one of the 
few people who built themselves 
into success coming from nearly 
nothing. So Im very excited to 
hear what he has to say.
While students may not be 
aware of Cosbys credentials out
side comedy and entertainment,

Cosby, who has a Ph.D. in educa
tion, has dedicated much of his 
time and money to education. 
Cosby received the Presiden
tial Medal of Freedom in 2002 
and the Bob Hope Humanitar
ian Award in 2003. He has also 
received honorary degrees from 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
the University of Cincinnati, and 
Baylor University.
Cosby has used his talents as 
an actor and comedian as edu
cational tools, playing one of the 
lead characters in the childrens 
television show The Electric Com
pany and creating the cartoon 
series Fat Albert and The Cosby 
Kids, a humorous show about a 
young group of friends facing 
the challenges of growing up in 
the city.
Cosby, along with five others, 
will receive honorary degrees 
from Carnegie Mellon during 
the commencement ceremony.

CMU buys 
out Holiday
HOLIDAY, from A1
which has gathered informa
tion and blood from thousands 
of gay men since the 1980s that 
ultimately helped explain the 
AIDS virus.
Since becoming a gay bar, 
Holiday has taken its fair share 
of abuse and hate activity. The 
criss-cross brick facade was 
erected during the 1980s, when 
the bar was a frequent target 
of bricks and stones thrown 
through the windows.
It was hell on earth back 
then, Honse said. Sometimes 
we had to fight in the streets. 
The bar was hidden in plain 
view, keeping a low profile to 
avoid drawing too much atten
tion, he said.
During that time, Carnegie 
Mellon was one of few institu
tions in the area that stepped 
up in Holidays defense by mak
ing sure students knew that 
they would face severe con
sequences for vandalizing or 
otherwise abusing the bar, the 
owners said.
Times have changed for the 
bar, and Holiday has since be
come frequented by both gay 
and straight clientele.
When the [Pittsburgh gay 
rights] ordinance passed in 
1990, everything changed, 
said Honse.
However, despite its commer
cial success, Tierney and Honse 
decided to sell the bar.
Its just time in our lives to 
move on, Honse said.
Carnegie Mellon, which has 
been acquiring property along 
that stretch of Forbes, bought 
the building before it went to 
market. It will be demolished by 
the end of June, and plans are 
in place for new construction on 
the current site.
As for Holiday, last call will 
happen on April 29. The own
ers plan to throw an open party 
starting at 6 p.m., during which 
they will sell all of the bars dec
orations and donate the money 
to charity.
The city of Pittsburgh has 
proclaimed April 24 Holiday 
Bar Day.

SNILE FOR THE CAMERA
Carnegie Mellon students gather at the Fence Wednesday night for a candelight vigil to commemorate the Virginia Tech tragedy.
SHOOTING, from A1
one of whom was an alumna of 
Virginia Tech, took turns speak
ing informally.
Two hours earlier, the Hillel 
Jewish University Center (JUC) 
of Pittsburgh hosted a vigil led 
by rabbi Jamie Gibson of Temple 
Sinai.
Gibson led those attending in 
song and prayer, and students 
read prayers as well. During the 
vigil, Gibson gave personal at
tention to each of the departed.
We knew that we wanted to 
read the names of every single 
person whose name had been re
leased, said Sahar Oz, the JUCs 
assistant director. And we also 
wanted to say a few things about 
them.
Students lit candles for each 
of the known victims: Liviu Librescu, a 76-year-old Holocaust 
survivor; Reema Samaha, an 
18-year-old first-year; Kevin 
Granata, a biomechanics re
searcher and a leader in his field; 
and 26 others.
The group also lit three can
dles for the victims whose names
had not yet been released.
Oz found Librescus death par
ticularly troubling. Librescu, a 
professor at Virginia Tech, was 
shot while protecting his stu
dents by guarding the entrance 
to his classroom.
He was murdered on Holo
caust Remembrance Day, which 
is an occasion observed around 
the world, Oz said. It sent shock 
and a tremendous sense of loss to 
the Jewish community.
The tragedy resonated in par
ticular with several Carnegie 
Mellon students in the JUC who 
met Virginia Tech students last 
May while on a Birthright trip to 
Israel.
One of the things we did im
mediately was try to reach the 
eight students who went on this 
trip from Virginia Tech, Oz said. 
All eight were unharmed.
We had that added element of 
emotional proximity, Oz said.
The modern languages de
partment is also making plans to 
reach out to Virginia Tech, in part 
because so many of the shootings 
took place in foreign-language 
classrooms.
We feel closer, said Sono 
Hayes-Takano, a Japanese 
professor.
Weve been brainstorming, 
Hayes-Takano said. People in 
MLSAC, [Modern Languages 
Student Advisory Committee], 
theyre thinking about raising 
money for [the victims] memo
rial fund.
Beyond the campus commu
nity, the Internet has helped 
many feel connected to the Vir
ginia Tech victims.
I think the Internet in this 
case has been a tremendous as
set, Oz said. I think Facebook is 
a great example.
Profiles of victims on Facebook, in addition to those on 
news sites such as CNN and BBC 
News, have helped humanize the 
tragedy.
We dont want these victims 
to become statistics, Oz said. 
Keep it personal.
But with such accessibility, 
fear is often not too far behind.
There is this sense of, It could 
happen to me, Oz said.
Students feeling vulnerable 
might benefit from becoming
familiar with Carnegie Mellons 
security policy.
We have trained a certain 
number of people ... in every 
building, said Madelyn Miller, 
director of Environmental 
Health & Safety (EH&S) at the 
university.
RAs, building marshals, and 
other qualified individuals are 
among those who have received 
training, she said.
EH&S has had a system called 
AlertNow in place for the past 
couple of years. AlertNow en
ables EH&S to make 5000 phone 
calls in about a minute, which 
could help alert floor marshals of 
a campus emergency.
Not everybody knows that we 
have these procedures in place, 
Miller said.
In the past, EH&Ss procedures 
were kept online behind a fire
wall. The procedures were priva
tized because they included the 
cell phone numbers of various 
staff members, in addition to the 
locations of hazardous materials 
throughout campus.
After Virginia Tech, EH&S de
cided to make the procedures
available to the public  without 
the information regarding cell 
phones or hazardous materials.
Carnegie Mellons urban cam
pus is an asset in the event of an 
emergency, Miller said. The uni
versity is within close reach of 
city, county, and state police.
I think it makes us safer, she 
said.
Moreover, RAs are trained to 
recognize suspicious students, 
which could help prevent a fu
ture incident, Kroll said. Concern 
from other students is often cause 
for immediate action.
Undoubtedly, we take that 
very seriously, he said.
For more information on uni
versity security, there will be a 
townhall meeting today at 7:30 
p.m. in the Connan Room in the 
University Center.
There will also be a vigil to
night at 8:30 p.m. outside the 
Cathedral of Learning on the 
University of Pittsburgh campus. 
The event; is open to the Pitts
burgh community, and attendees 
are encouraged to wear orange 
and maroon or black helps with 
the grieving process.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 23, 2007
More foreign graduate students choosing to enroll in American universities
STUDENTS, from Al
conditions in their students na
tive countries.
The Taiwanese student popu
lation in the U.S., at its height in 
the 1970s, is now dwindling as 
Taiwan continues to strengthen 
its economy. A similar situation 
occurred in China in the 1980s.
Currently, the majority of for
eign graduate students in the 
physics program hail from East
ern Europe, Turkey, and India.
It is so rare to see students 
from Japan and Great Britain, for 
example, since these countries 
have already clearly established 
themselves, Li said.
In the 1980s, each graduate 
physics class (about 15 students) 
tended to be 70 to 80 percent 
American. Today, its 15 to 20 
percent.
The graduate population of 
the department of chemistry 
is similar in composition. The 
department is composed of 43 
percent domestic and 57 percent 
international students.
As we are talking about rela
tively small numbers (76 students 
in the department, 14 in the en
tering class); it would be hard to 
say that international students 
dominate the department, said 
Linda Peteanu, co-chair of the 
graduate program committee for 
chemistry.
Frank Pfenning, director of
graduate programs in computer 
science, agreed.
I would not at all characterize 
the department as one domi
nated by international students, 
he said.
When I stop to think about 
it, my program does have a lot 
of international students, said 
Henry Towsner, a graduate stu
dent in mathematics. But its 
not something that comes up 
that often.
The CGS also tracked the 
growth rates of applications in 
individual areas of study.
The volume of applications 
grew 8 percent for graduate pro
grams in engineering and earth 
sciences and 13 percent for those 
in life sciences. Applications in
creased 7 percent for programs 
in business, 8 percent in educa
tion, and 12 percent in arts and 
humanities. The number of ap
plications for programs in the 
social sciences did not increase.
International students tend 
to choose long-term careers like 
pure sciences and engineering 
instead of shorter-term careers 
such as philosophy, history, and 
business, said Li.
Student preferences may also 
be a question of finances.
Departments such as physics 
and computer science are able 
to employ students as teaching 
assistants for first-year under
graduate courses and eventually
as research * assistants to the  
department, allowing them to 
receive a stipend. While students 
still have to pay tuition, the de
partment can provide financial 
assistance depending on the case 
of the particular student.
In contrast, departments 
in the College of Humanities
& Social Sciences have fewer 
openings for such positions 
and therefore fewer stipends to 
give out. Additionally, these de
partments generally have less 
financial assistance to offer proT 
spective students, which may be 
a deterrent.
However, foreign graduate 
students may be attracted to U.S. 
universities for more than finan
cial reasons.
International students are 
attracted to first-class research 
and teaching, visible through 
the quality of the faculty and the 
ranking of the various schools 
and programs, Pfenning said.
Todays international students 
may have to work harder than 
ever to enter and remain in the 
United States without problems. 
Due to the Immigration Act of 
2003, a response to the events 
of 9/11, students have had to 
confront stricter immigration 
policies.
Correspondingly, the survey 
showed that the rate of foreign 
graduate applications hit its 
peak in 2003 at 25 percent and
has since been declining.
In addition, Pfenning worried 
that the psychological effects 
of 9/11 and the U.S.s role in 
the war in Iraq would make for
eign students feel unwelcome at 
Carnegie Mellon.
I was very concerned about 
this, but it has not been substan
tiated by our numbers in the 
Ph.D. program, Pfenning said.
I feel like the international 
population we mostly deal with 
at Carnegie Mellon, mainly In
dian, some Asian, and Eastern 
European countries, have never 
really had much trouble, Li said. 
The biggest issue is usually a 
visa coming a little bit later than 
the student wanted.
However, Peteanu is still wor
ried about the effects of stricter 
U.S. policies on the future of in
ternational students, as well as 
the university.
I have anecdotal evidence 
that more students from Asia, 
Eastern Europe, and South Asia
 our three dominant sources 
of foreign students  are start
ing to look to graduate schools in 
Western Europe rather than the 
U.S., partially for these reasons, 
said Peteanu. As science spend
ing in other countries increases, 
making those countries more at
tractive to graduate students, I 
think the impact of immigration 
issues on the U.S. graduate pop
ulation may increase as well.

Survey reports trends in first-years
FIRST-YEARS, from A3
more important, she continued, 
referring to the battery of tests 
mandated by the Bush admin
istrations No Child Left Behind 
Act. The need to teach to the 
test, she said, has forced teach
ers to de-emphasize skills that 
are crucial for college work.
These new teaching methods 
cause students to come to college 
with a different set of expecta
tions than in the past, Nair said.
Students seem less inclined 
to try before giving up, she said. 
Willingness to fail is gone. You 
give a kid a C and it is seen as an 
unacceptable grade.
Statistics show that these students attitudes may be due to a 
perceived increase in academic 
competition. From the inception 
of the study, four-year institu
tions have been experiencing 
unprecedented increases in ap
plications and enrollment, many 
receiving almost double the 
number they received in 1967.
This could have to do with 
the Common Application, Lopez 
said. The Common Application 
gives students the ability to ap
ply to many institutions with 
just one application.
Carnegie Mellon applicants 
reflect this trend. In 2003, 53 
percent of Carnegie Mellon ap
plicants applied to six or more 
schools, compared to only 8
percent in 1975.
In addition, students are get
ting choosier  in 1975, 77 
percent of enrolled first-years 
cited Carnegie Mellon as their 
first choice versus less than 50 
percent today.
Accordingly, Carnegie Mellon 
has received record numbers of 
applications for the past several 
years. As of last February, the 
university had received a re
cord 22,052 applications, a 19.2 
percent increase over last year 
alone, according to a university 
press release.
The study predicted that the 
volume of applications will 
continue to grow until at least 
2015.

Carnegie Science Center holds event for Earth Day
Earth Day event features global warming presentation and films to raise environmental awareness
by Christine deBriffault
Staffwriter
Filled with movies, presen
tations, and environmental 
activities, the Carnegie Science 
Center hosted its Earth Day event 
last Saturday.
Bill Perkins, a lecturer from 
the Climate Project, a nonprofit 
group dedicated to raising global 
warming awareness, was one of 
the presenters at the event. His 
presentation, entitled Its time 
to Act: The Reality of Global 
Warming, discussed the causes 
of climate change and its impact 
on peoples quality of life.
Greenhouse gases in the at
mosphere contribute to global 
warming because they absorb 
heat that reflects off the Earth, 
thereby warming the Earth. 
Greenhouse gases include car
bon dioxide, which is emitted 
from the burning of fossil fuels, 
and methane, which is produced 
in the process of making coal.
Global warming threatens 
to melt glaciers in the Arctic, 
potentially increasing Arctic 
temperatures by several degrees. 
Melting icebergs will also in
crease water levels, and they may 
also influence ocean currents by 
causing freshwater to enter the 
ocean.
Furthermore, this process of 
heat absorption by icebergs is 
self-perpetuating. When an ice
berg melts, the leftover water 
absorbs sunlight, which causes 
the iceberg to melt even further. 
Thus, global warming enacts a 
positive feedback loop that leads 
to even more glacier melting.
A key point that Perkins made 
in his presentation was that Hu
man beings have become a force 
of nature. In other words, popu
lation growth, as well as humans 
continual reliance on technol
ogy, has led to global warming.
More specifically, as the hu
man population grows, the 
demand for resources and land 
increases. As more people clear 
trees to make room for homes 
and farmland, there are fewer 
trees to control carbon dioxide 
levels through photosynthesis. 
This results in increasing 
amounts of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere.
Deren Guler/Photo Editor
Last Saturdays Earth Day event focused on the influence of humans on the environment. The Carnegie Science Center plans to hold this event every year.
Increasing population leads to 
greater energy demand as well. 
This demand is mostly for coal, 
which emits more carbon diox
ide into the atmosphere than any 
other energy source.
Perkins also talked about how 
technology has allowed humans 
to move from manual labor to 
machine labor. Although ma
chines produce more products 
over time, thus satisfying the in
crease in product demand from 
population growth, they often 
use fossil fuels for energy, thus 
emitting greenhouse gases.
In his presentation, Perkins 
dispelled the notion that there is 
nothing one can do to help solve 
the self-perpetuating problem of 
global warming. In fact, Perkins 
said that this misconception only 
adds to the problem of global 
warming.
According to Perkins, humans 
already have everything they 
need to curb global warming, 
including renewable energy 
sources and passenger vehicle 
efficiency. He also said that the
measures needed to stop global 
warming are not only cost effec
tive but also easy to do..
He said, Use compact fluo
rescent light bulbs, inflate tires, 
check water heaters, use lowflow shower heads and take 
shorter showers, reduce garbage, 
plant a tree, and tell your legis
lature to pass Earth-saving bills. 
All of these things combined can 
save up to 5500 pounds of/:arbon 
dioxide.
In addition to Perkins presen
tation, Earth Day at the Carnegie 
Science Center consisted of environment-based films. The movies 
were shown in smaller theaters, 
and two movies, Stormchasers 
and Coral Reef, were shown in an 
IMAX theater.
- There was also an 18-foot in
flatable Earth in UMPC Sports 
World across from the Science 
Center and a RiverQuest pro
gram for people interested in 
searching for various aquatic or
ganisms in the nearby river.
The films seemed to be the 
highlight of the day for Penn
State students Max Staplin and 
Eric Gruebel.
Gruebel said, In addition to 
Earth Day events, watching the 
Coral Reef movie in IMAX put it 
all into perspective. Before Earth 
Day, I didnt realize how big of a 
problem global warming was and 
how rapidly it was happening. 
Gruebel said that the Earth 
Day event has even led him to 
consider certain career options. 
Gruebel said, As an engineering 
student, it makes me think of go
ing into green engineering. 
Staplin said that the one thing 
he learned was that the planet 
was better off before we got 
here.
According to Hall, the Earth 
Day celebration and the Rachel 
Carson Environmental Film Fes
tival will become an annual event 
at the Carnegie Science Center.
The Rachel Carson Envi
ronmental Film Festival is a 
collection of films about the 
environment that span a wide 
range of genres, including com
edies and thrillers. Hall said that
the film festival will continue on 
the first Saturday of each month, 
June through December 2007.
In addition to hosting Earth 
Day, Hall stated that Carnegie 
Science Center will be focus
ing heavily on the environment 
in the next several years as it 
advances its project Eco.Experience. Eco.Experience is still in 
the planning stages, but accord
ing to an article in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, this project will in
volve an expansion of the current 
center, including the addition of 
new facilities.
According to Hall, the Carn
egie Science Center is currently 
incorporating environmental is
sues into its endeavors.
Hall stated, Our caf contin
ues to support local farms, our 
outreach programs continue to 
develop environmental educa
tion curricula and our rivers and 
environment will be a critical 
part of our development over the 
next several years  embodied 
in the project we are calling Eco.

How Things Work: Lasers
Michael M. Whiston
A laser is a device that can read data 
from a CD, provide a light spectacle, and 
even produce a concentrated, coherent 
beam of light capable of cutting through 
materials.
A laser (Light Amplification by 
Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is 
essentially an energy emitter.
Atoms have different energy levels, or 
orbits, containing electrons. When these 
electrons are in their lowest energy orbit, 
the atom is considered to be in its ground 
state. When an atom absorbs energy, its 
electrons transition from lower-energy 
orbits to higher-energy orbits. When 
these electrons return to their lowest 
energy orbit, they produce energy that 
takes the form of light or, in this case, a 
laser beam.
Lasers feed atoms energy, causing 
electrons in the atoms to transition to 
higher energy orbits. The source that 
feeds atoms, called the source of excita
tion, may be a light or another laser. The 
source emits energy in pulses or a con
tinuous wave.
The material that absorbs energy from 
the source of excitation is called the lasing medium. The wavelength of light 
depends on this material, which varies 
from laser to laser. Alexandrite lasers, 
for instance, use gemstones as their lasing mediums, whereas dye lasers use 
dyes that are dissolved in a solvent.
This resulting wide range of light 
wavelengths allows lasers to be used in 
a variety of disciplines, including medi
cine, tattoo removal, and electronics. 
Carbon dioxide lasers, for example, emit 
infrared light that is hot enough to melt 
steel. A ruby red laser, on the other hand, 
emits visible light that is suitable for re
moving freckles.
Laser beams have unique character
istics when compared to light emitted 
from a light bulb. First, laser beams are 
monochromatic. The color depends on 
the amount of energy produced by the 
atoms electrons. Second, lasers produce
Courtesy of FORCE Technology
Lasers produce a beam of light using stimulated emission, or a cascade of energy emissions.
light waves that are coherent, or in phase 
with one another. In other words, the 
parallel light waves travel in sync. Last, a 
laser produces light with a concentrated 
beam. This beam is produced by a pro
cess known as stimulated emission.
In stimulated emission, an atom emits 
a photon of energy, which interacts with 
another atom of the same material, caus
ing it to emit a second photon that has the 
same amount of energy as the first pho
ton. This process propagates throughout 
the material, leading to a cascade of en
ergy emissions.
Lasers also contain mirrors that re
flect the photons back and forth. As the 
photons reflect between the two mirrors, 
more electrons return to their lowest en
ergy level, thereby producing more light. 
Light passes through one of the mirrors 
to exit the laser.
In medicine, lasers operate based on 
the technique of selective photother
molysis. This technique involves the 
removal of target tissues and preserva
tion of surrounding tissues by using the 
appropriate energy and wavelength of 
laser light.
In vision correction, for instance, excimer lasers (which produce ultraviolet 
light) are used to eliminate corneal tissue 
around the eye. This procedure improves 
the eyes ability to focus light. To correct 
nearsightedness, excimer lasers flatten 
the cornea, moving the eyes focal point 
closer to the retina. In farsighted vi
sion correction, excimer lasers create a 
steeper slope about the cornea, moving 
the eyes focal point closer to the retina.
Dye lasers are used to remove vascu
lar lesions. One type of vascular lesion 
is a port-wine stain, which is a deformed 
part of a blood vessel that connects arter
ies to veins. These deformed blood ves
sels appear during birth, but they can be 
removed by dye lasers without harming 
skin tissue.
In addition to providing medical treat
ment, lasers are also used to remove 
tattoos. When laser light shines on a 
tattoo, the pigment absorbs the light, 
causing the ink to segment into tiny 
pieces, which are removed by the bodys 
white blood cells. Q-switched lasers are 
often used to remove tattoos without 
scarring skin. These lasers emit short 
pulses of energy at a high voltage. The 
lasers effectiveness, however, depends 
on the pigment color. Green and blue 
laser pigments tend to absorb red light, 
whereas red and orange laser pigments 
tend to absorb green light best.
Many electronic devices, on the other 
hand, use lasers to read data off of a disk. 
In particular, CD players contain small 
lasers. These lasers read music off of the 
CD based on a pattern of bumps that ap
pear on the CDs aluminum surface.
As the CD spins, the laser beam reflects 
off of the CDs aluminum surface and en
ters a light sensor. The sensor detects the 
presence of a bump on the CD when the 
laser changes its reflection angle. The 
optical sensor converts these readings 
into a digital signal, which is then turned 
into musical sound.
Lasers have many other uses, including 
the creation of holographs, measurement 
of distances, and the cutting of steel. La
sers are also used in physics to study the 
properties of plasma, a gas that contains 
free electrons and composes most stars.
From objects as large as stars to de
vices as small as CD players, lasers allow 
doctors, artists, and engineers to per
form tasks that could not be performed 
with conventional technologies.
SciTechBriefs
Brain views images 
past borders
Researchers from the Uni
versity of Delaware and Yale 
University recently performed 
a study showing that the brain 
uses boundary extension to 
process certain images. Bound
ary extension is the process of 
predicting features that exist 
beyond the images borders 
(i.e., beyond peripheral vision).
In this study, researchers pre
sented participants with pairs 
of images. In some conditions, 
the images were identical, but 
in other conditions, one of 
the images showed a close-up 
shot whereas the other image 
showed a distant shot.
Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) 
scans, researchers observed the 
functioning of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) in the 
brains of participants.
Researchers found that in 
most conditions, the PPA exhib
ited less activity for the second 
image than for the first. This 
finding suggests that the brain 
does not process all features of 
an image if it is viewing that im
age for the second time. Instead,

Ethanol vehicles 
pose health risk
Stanford University profes
sor Mark Jacobson created a 
computer model showing that 
the use of bioethanol cars in 
2020 will cause ozone levels to 
increase in some United States 
locations. Ozone is a pollut
ant that can lead to respiratory 
problems.
The simulation compared air 
quality 13 years from now un
der two conditions. In the first 
condition, cars were filled with 
gasoline. In the second condi
tion, cars were filled with 85% 
ethanol.
Jacobson found that there 
were higher ozone levels in 
some United States locations 
when cars were filled with etha
nol than when they were filled 
with gasoline. According to the 
study, this increase would cause 
990 hospitalizations due to re
spiratory problems.

Robot to be used in 
brain surgery
A group of researchers, led 
by Garnette Sutherland of the 
University of Calgary, has de
veloped a surgical robot called 
NeuroArm. The robot is intended 
to be used for neurosurgical pro
cedures.
NeuroArm uses MRI scans 
to obtain images of body parts. 
These images allow doctors to 
control NeuroArm at a micro
scopic level from a computer.
The major benefit of Neu
roArm is that doctors no longer 
need to use their hands in surgi
cal procedures. Doctors hope to 
perform NeuroArms first surgi
cal procedure this summer.

Virus kills fish in 
Great Lakes
A virus called viral hemor
rhagic septicemia (VHS) has 
killed thousands of fish in the 
Great Lakes area due to hemor
rhaging and organ failure. The 
virus does not have a known 
cure, and it may be spreading to 
Lake Michigan.
Scientists first identified VHS 
in 2005. Since this time, the vi
rus has spread to Lake St. Claire, 
Lake Ontario, the Niagara River 
and other bodies of water in the 
Great Lakes area.

Booth and Buggy are not the 
most fun Carnival traditionsFromTheEditorialBoard
Rachael Clemmons

Weilte

Everyone tries to convince you to drive a 
buggy, or push a buggy, or build a booth.
a super-fun event filled with entertain
ment and no class and rainbows and 
butterflies. Everyone tries to convince 
you to drive a buggy, or push a buggy, 
or build a booth. So as a first-year, al
though I wasnt tricked into driving a 
buggy (and still havent been, thank
fully), I had this grand, though vague, 
idea that Carnival would be all about 
the long-standing Carnegie Mellon tra
ditions of pushing little girls down hills 
and building shacks in a parking lot. 
Then Carnival happened. And it was a 
delicious and ridiculous extravaganza.
We certainly do deserve a rest. Carn
egie Mellon has the tendency to break 
peoples souls (as though breaking our 
wallets isnt quite enough). Carnival is 
a welcome pause from the insanity of 
papers and exams, presentations and 
projects. But then comes the ridiculous
ness of Carnival: The rides close early 
and are too pricey to even consider, and 
Pittsburghs horrific1 weather system 
ruins everything. When my friend got
to Booth and Buggy. It takes a lot to get 
up that early in the morning and push 
a person inside one of those things, or 
to stay up all night using power tools. 
You all may not be the lucky ones who 
can get trashed while watching Oprah 
mid-afternoon, but you still deserve 
kudos. (Except, again, for those of you 
who wake us Morewood residents. Keep 
it down!) To assuage any jealousy you 
avid participants might feel, let me as
sure you that most students will down 
more than enough shots for you. So 
dont you dare feel neglected.
The real festivities of Carnival guar
antee a good time. Carnival is ridicu
lous! Ridiculously glorified. Forget what 
Carnival is supposed to be  rides? 
Booths? Not at all! Embrace our inter
pretation of it instead: PARTY!Internet plays powerful role in wake of Va. Tech
Amid the chaos of what is already be
ing called the Virginia Tech massacre, 
the Internet was a steady flow of fairly 
accurate information. Blogs  typir 
cally the anti-news source  were what 
helped piece together the events of early 
last Monday. Facebook  the social 
networking site of the century  was 
what helped friends and family know 
loved ones were okay. AIM idle times
 usually an annoyance to anyone who 
wants to talk to someone  were identi
fiers to possible whereabouts for specific 
times. Wikipedia  what you shouldnt 
quote in your class paper  garnered 
a timetable of events from the afore
mentioned online sources. News sites
 reliable sources  assembled infor
mation about victims from their online 
profiles.
Most of us were affected by the shoot
ings at Columbine in April 1999; as 
middle schoolers and junior high stu
dents, a high school shooting wasnt 
something to which we could easily turn 
a blind eye. Yet the shootings at Virginia 
Tech seem different, as we are all more 
closely linked by our similarities  we 
are all college students  and by our 
constant connection to the Internet.
As we have seen with the deaths of 
students on our own campus, a Facebook wall can become a memorial; and
as students who dont know the deceased 
read the walls, its often an additional 
cause for legitimate sorrow. Facebook, 
and the Internet as a whole, lets us get 
a little bit closer to knowing the people 
who have died, and lets us understand 
what victims friends are going through, 
too. The walls of the Virginia Tech mas
sacre victims are experiencing the same 
flood of visitors, and a lot of it stands to 
show that as a generation, we are capa
ble of coming together to support each 
other.
ABCNews.corns April 16 article about 
online developments included bits 
from some students online postings; 
one included a request for a Facebook 
group that calls to keep the facts of the 
incident straight. Another posting from 
ABCNews.corns article said that people 
from all over the world were solicit
ing videos of personal reactions from 
students via the Internet. The way the 
Internet has been utilized by our gen
eration for the Virginia Tech Massacre 
is telling. While great in some ways, the 
Internet cannot be. a substitute for ac
tion or an acceptable replacement for 
tasteful behavior.
The sheer volume of people expressing 
condolences is amazing and, perhaps, 
comforting. At the same time, the del
uge of Internet gestures makes each
one progressively more meaningless. 
A group search for Virginia Tech and 
pray on Facebook returns over 500 
results. Except for two groups, at least 
the first five pages of search returns for 
just Virginia Tech are some kind of 
remembrance groups. Th sentiment 
is spectacular if its based in fact or ac
tion, but it is important to remember 
that starting a Facebook group does 
not necessarily solve problems or incite 
real action. Ultimately, human contact 
is what will help us all move on from 
this tragedy, not staring at a computer 
screen.
The varied uses for the Internet in the 
case of the massacre backs arguments, 
from both sides about the Internet: It 
globalizes, but also singularizes; brings 
people together, but also prevents actual 
involvement. We encourage students 
to use the Internet to help grieve and 
show support for the Virginia Tech com
munity. When grappling with such 
terrible loss, the Internet is an excellent 
tool  it just shouldnt be the only tool. 
Good things come from the Internet be
ing used to its fullest capacity, and so 
do weaker things. We are the Internet 
generation. We just need to learn to har
ness the power of the Internet, to use it 
to unite, but to not expect impossible 
things from it.

Graduate student candidates to address all students concerns
I am writing to respond to Mr. Peterss 
assertion that Egelman and Arasin are 
both graduate students, which makes 
one wonder what their commitment is 
regarding undergraduate concerns. 
Joe and I are deeply committed to ad
dressing the concerns of all students 
on campus, both graduate and under
graduate. With Joes three years of 
experience in Senate, and my two years 
as an officer in GSA, we understand the 
issues across the broad spectrum of stu
dents at CMU.
The question that should be asked is, 
What are the other candidates com
mitments to all students? Unlike the 
other candidates, every part of our 
platform applies to both graduate and 
undergraduate students. We need lead
ers to represent all Carnegie Mellon 
students equally.
Our issues are not graduate issues or 
undergraduate issues. They are student 
issues. We plan to promote civic partici
pation through voter registration drives 
and rides to the polls; promote commu
nity participation by getting students 
involved in off-campus volunteer activi
ties and taking advantage of all that the 
Cultural District has to offer; promote 
community accessibility by continuing 
to lobby for public transportation; and 
promote student interests on the state 
and national levels by continuing our 
efforts to lobby legislators. We plan to 
unite the campus, rather than simply 
make promises to the 55 percent of the 
student body that consist? of under
graduate students.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 23, 2007
Presidential
Perspectives
Get out and vote 
for meaningful 
representation
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Each year our campus com
munity entertains certain new 
public discussions: How do we 
encourage diversity within 
student activities? How do we 
engage an apathetic campus? 
This time of year, the questions 
inevitably turn to, How can 
you increase student turnout in 
campus elections? When will 
students recognize the impor
tance of student government? 
But these arent new questions, 
this isnt a new discussion, and 
we dont have a new answer.
Certain things just are. Stu
dents care about campus, but 
that level of concern can vary 
with the weather, the,amount of 
school work, and, in the case of 
student government, the people 
in office. This year, we didnt 
seek to provide or become an 
answer to the fundamental ques
tion. We just wanted to alter the 
perception and the reality of stu
dent government.
This year, we sought to re
define the meaning of student 
governments capacity. We think 
weve got a lot done toward 
that goal and we hope students 
agree.
Thats why this election is so 
important to us. Election turnout 
can be interpreted in two ways: 
as a reflection on the value of 
the current administration or 
on the controversy of a poten
tial administration. This year, 
the candidates are all engaged, 
passionate individuals, and free 
of controversy. So, ultimately 
this election tests whether or not 
weve convinced you of a basic 
idea: that student government 
can and should serve a meaning
ful purpose on campus.
Whether you approved of 
the Mixed-Gender Pilot or 
not, you can recognize that it 
was a student-driven change. 
Whether or not you ever read 
TartansWiki.org, you can recog
nize that it can be a tremendously 
useful tool for students. And 
whether or not you like the bike 
program, you can recognize that 
instituting such a program means 
having a vision, a goal, and an 
ability to act in the interests of 
students. Thats the capacity 
and importance of student gov
ernment. We think thats really, 
really important. We hope you 
do, too.
So from Tuesday to Wednesday, 
please vote, because this election 
is more than just the issues and 
more than just the candidates. 
Its about the capacity of student 
government to do something 
meaningful for students. Were 
not saying it will; were not say
ing that any of these candidates 
are the ones to git-r-done; but 
we want you to say that theres 
the potential. And if that doesnt 
hold meaning, please just vote 
because were asking you to.
This years Carnival theme was "Small Things Made Large. So we asked,
What small thing would you like to see made large?A PERSONS OPINION
Compiled byJ.W. Ramp
Vonnegut dies at age 84; His sharp American commentary lives on
Environmentalism is a concern that should bridge party lines
______________Jessica Thurston
Recently, the issues surround
ing the climate crisis and the hu
man populations contribution 
to global warming have finally 
gained social and political 
grounding. Environmental poli
cies and rhetoric are infiltrating 
the daily lives of even us college 
students, as the credibility of 
cultural products and commu
nities is beginning to rest upon 
that elements ability to sustain 
the earth. Green technology 
and the ability of neighborhoods 
to become LEED-certified are 
becoming important factors in 
assessing the legitimacy and re
spect of a given community in 
the intellectual world, as is the 
potential for such products as 
household cleaners and personal 
vehicles to contribute to the 
green cause.
The significance of being green 
aware  of understanding that 
the burden to save Gods green 
Earth falls upon us, humans, the 
Earths most powerful inhabit
ants  has finally crossed into 
the realm of politics. Recently, 
the Supreme Court stressed the 
impact of carbon dioxide emis
sions on global warming, add
ing that the U.S. can and has 
contributed to the movements 
damaging effects. The Courts 
admitting of the fact that a re
duction in domestic emissions 
would slow the pace of global 
emissions increases, as written 
by Justice John Paul Stevens in 
the majority opinion, signals the 
necessity of the powerful politi
cal body in advancing the U.S. 
fight against global warming 
and greenhouse gases. In many
ways, I think it is necessary to 
have politics on our side to really 
cause change on a mass scale in 
our seemingly bureaucratic soci
ety. But when does political jar
gon overwhelm and hide the real 
issues at stake?
California, along with 11 
other states, challenged the En
vironmental Protection Agencys 
(EPA) non-stance on the issue 
of dangerous chemical tailpipe 
emissions. So far, the EPA has 
offered a laundry list of rea
sons not to regulate [tailpipe] 
emissions, according to Ste
vens, as reported in an April 3 
article titled Court: Do some
thing about global warming on 
CNN. corns online Law Center.
In challenging the agency, 
California apparently expected 
to raise awareness of the U.S.s 
contribution to global warming. 
Although such a proposition is 
incredibly important and should 
take next to no convincing of 
the general (and especially edu
cated) population, the very act of 
challenging the EPA is what set 
off the Courts dissenters and is 
what is making the issue of sav
ing the environment more of a 
red-and-blue political fight than 
a humanitarian issue.
If were going to save the world, 
it has to happen now. What the 
CNN.com issue brings to light is 
the uneven mix that results from 
the contrast between real-life 
environmental issues and the 
ambiguous, intangible realm of 
political jargon. This also relates 
to an important point that lies at 
the heart of distinguishing the 
humanitarian from the political: 
We cannot let the issue of car
bon dioxide emissions and their 
resulting climate crisis become 
a Democrat versus Republican 
issue.
Moreover, we as members of 
the human race need to be able to 
look past the political and legal 
red tape and delVe into the heart 
of the issue. It is Chief Justice 
John Roberts, one of the justices 
holding a dissenting view on the 
Courts position, who seems to 
be doing exactly the opposite, 
and as a consequence, is holding 
us back from solving the climate 
crisis. The article reported that 
he insisted on investigating the 
right or non-right of the states to 
question the EPA, and even said 
that his dissenting position in
volves no judgment on whether 
global warming exists, what 
causes it, or the extent of the 
problem.
How can he say this and be 
proud of his position? It seems 
to me wholly ignorant to still 
want to ignore the environmen
tal issues at hand and focus on 
the nitty-gritty, conservativeversus-liberal Constitutional 
interpretation side of the issue 
when there is so much evidence 
about the dangerous U.S. con
tribution to global warming that 
is screaming at us to finally do 
something. The U.S. political 
bodies need to break free of the 
ever-constricting red tape and 
into the diminishing rainforests, 
into the depleted ozone layer, 
and onto the melting ice caps. 
This is not an issue to be solved 
on paper; this is an issue to be 
solved in a hands-on manner. 
We need political and legislative 
bodies to move issues along and 
make them public, but we can
not allow those bodies to halt 
important ethical investigations 
in favor of staying inside the red 
lines.
The issue of admitting our 
contribution to global warming 
and working to solve it is about
the physical Earth. It is about 
the walk down Forbes Avenue 
to class, the hike youll take with 
your friends after May gradua
tion, the trip to the grocery store. 
Its about that breath of anxiety 
that sets in like a chill as you 
quicken your pace when late to 
class, its about getting the per
fect grip to pull yourself up onto 
the next mountain boulder, its 
about feeling the weight of the 
thin, plastic grocery bags dig
ging into your palms.
The climate crisis is not about 
50-page reports or stuffy suits. 
The climate crisis is about faceto-face communication and 
connecting with the person 
next to you. We cannot get from 
one place to another without 
the natural balance between 
land and water, earth and air. 
Maintaining this sense of con
nectivity will take more than a 
handful of lobbyists and a wellplanned campaign commercial, 
although these are necssary 
steps to take toward change in 
our increasingly bureaucratic 
world. While legislative back
ing can and should be a catalyst 
for widespread change, we (and 
Roberts) need to realize that sav
ing the world is about saving the 
here and now, and respecting 
the connections we are still able 
to make with other people and 
other forms of life on the planet.
The Earth existed before 
the red tape, before the nine 
Supreme Court justices were 
installed, before a file cabinet 
housed at the EPA became filled 
with under-exposed, overly or
nate environmental reports. And 
the Earth will exist after all of 
that  as long as we can look 
past political inequalities and 
legislative discrepancies and 
come together to incite legislative and judicial action to protect 
what is really outside, and what 
really needs help  the air, the 
land, the water, the walk to class, 
and the trip to Giant Eagle. Sav
ing this way of living  saving 
this Earth  will take a healthy 
balance between legislative sup
port and overwhelming political 
debate, similar to that of the del
icate relationship between man 
and nature.
I applaud the Supreme Court 
for acknowledging this issue. 
I applaud the CNN.com article 
for underscoring the discrepan
cies between the humanistic and 
legislative efforts to deter carbon 
dioxide emissions. But the incon
gruity between the dissenting 
justices opinion about respecting 
man-made law over the delicacy 
of nature is alarming. The article 
further mentioned the dissent of 
Justice Antonin Scalia, who said 
that the Court does not have the 
right to force the EPA to create 
any standards on tailpipe emis
sions  or to do anything at all, 
presumably  no matter how 
important the underlying policy 
issues at stake.
It is time to hang up the law 
and really pay attention to what 
is at stake. It is the Earth. We 
are in it. It was here first, be
fore the law, and its survival or 
demise will be decided based 
on our actions outside of the 
political jargon of the Supreme 
Court or the EPA or the state of 
California. If we dont limit tail
pipe emissions, global warming 
will in fact be largely the fault of 
the U.S., but aside from fault, we 
will lose the most powerful force 
that we have  nature.

As I stare at the copy of 
Bluebeard sitting on my desk, 
I cant help but feel an over
whelming sense of sadness. Kurt 
Vonnegut was a voice for gen
erations of the disaffected  a 
voice that spoke and wrote so 
eloquently and with such passion 
that nothing else in the world 
could match it.
Listen: Kurt Vonnegut was 
in an underground bunker in 
the city of Dresden, Germany, 
in the 1940s, when the Allied 
forces firebombed it. The city 
was destroyed and everyone was 
killed, in what most regard as a 
pretty dumb move on the Allies 
part. The city had no military 
operations except for the POW 
camp. Bombing Dresden bene
fited only one person, Vonnegut 
said. I am that person. I wrote 
Slaughterhouse-Five.... One way 
or another, I got two or three dol
lars for every person killed.
During the summer before I 
started college, I rode the train in 
Germany. Before we crossed the 
border into the Czech Republic, 
the train stopped in Dresden. As 
I stared out of the cabin win
dow trying to get a better view, I 
imagined what Vonnegut himself 
felt staring out over the rubble 
just over 60 years prior. The city, 
a safe haven in the tumultuous 
state of Germany, lay before him,
a vast expanse of wreckage, most 
of it still on fire.
Slaughterhouse-Five was cen
tered on Vonneguts experience 
in Dresden and fully demonstrat
ed the absurdities of war and 
how it affected soldiers and citi
zens alike. In it, Vonnegut draws 
a tombstone for the main charac
ter. The epitaph on the tombstone 
reads, Everything was beautiful 
and nothing hurt. Really? In an 
anti-war novel? Oh, Vonnegut, 
you are too clever.
Vonnegut spent most of his 
adult life watching the world 
around him crumble at the hands 
of men: World War II, the Nixon 
administration, global warming. 
Whatever the subject, Vonnegut 
infused his writing with his 
own take on the world. After 
Vonnegut, science fiction novels 
were almost expected to contain 
a deeper message about the ills 
of society.
Vonneguts first novel, Player 
Piano, reflected his belief that 
in the future, everything would 
be mechanized and industrys 
use for people would dwindle. 
Vonnegut once said, Human 
beings will be happier  not 
when they cure cancer or get 
to Mars or eliminate racial 
prejudice or flush Lake Erie, but 
when they find ways to inhabit 
primitive communities again. 
Vonneguts world was a throw
back to simpler times, when the 
polar icecaps werent melting, 
when people were unified, and 
the government was just. He got
Our endowment.
this message across, not just in 
Player Piano, but also in novels 
like Jailbird, Cats Cradle, and, of 
course, Slaughterhouse-Five.
Did Vonnegut draw inspira
tion to write Player Piano from 
his time at Carnegie Mellon? 
Probably not, but interestingly 
enough, Carnegie Mellon hap
pens to be an institution that 
regards technology very highly. 
Thankfully, and I think Vonnegut 
would agree, it values people 
more.
Vonneguts novels were power
ful, but they didnt change the 
reality of things. Wars raged, 
people died, and the environ
ment suffered. Vonnegut, who 
failed at suicide in 1984, reflected 
on the death of friend Ernest 
Hemingway, saying, When 
Hemingway killed himself he put 
a period at the end of his life; old 
age is more like a semicolon. 
But Vonnegut had a backup plan. 
He tried to smoke himself to 
death. It didnt work. In a Rolling 
Stone interview given last year, 
Vonnegut revealed his plan to sue 
the Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Company, saying, Im 83 
years old. The lying bastards! On 
the package Brown & Williamson 
promised to kill me. Instead, 
their cigarettes didnt work. Now 
Im forced to suffer leaders with 
names like Bush and Dick and, up 
until recently, Colon.
Vonneguts last book, a col
lection of short essays titled A 
Man Without A Country, was 
so named because the America

of Vonneguts youth was gone. 
He was a stranger in his own 
country, alienated by politics, the 
government, and society. Most of 
the essays in the book are about 
Vonneguts beef with these same 
things.
Vonnegut was much more than 
a person. He represented a time 
and place when America was 
losing faith in itself  a time 
that parallels our own. Vonnegut 
gave a face to what countless 
disillusioned Americans were
Henry Huang/Art Staff
slowly coming to realize. Weve 
fucked the planet, and ourselves. 
Theres no way to fix it. Vonnegut 
said it straight. He didnt try to 
shelter his readers, or tell them 
everything was going to be fine, 
because it wasnt. People real
ized that fact too late.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 23, 2007
Womens tennis finishes second in the UAA for 
the second year in a row; men lose to W & L 3-6
TENNIS, from A12
New York University in the thirdplace match.
The mens tennis team came 
up short against the 17th-ranked 
Washington and Lee University 
3-6. The Wednesday afternoon 
match was scheduled to be 
played at Carnegie Mellon, but 
was moved to the Greensburg 
Racquet Clubs indoor facili
ties in Greensburg, Pa. The loss 
moves the Tartans to 17-5 for the 
season, while the Yellow Jackets 
improve to 18-2.
In the singles competition, 
first-year James Muliawan de
feated Washington and Lee 
player Tim Ross in the numberone singles by a score of 7-6 
(7-4), 7-6 (7-5).
Fellow first-year Jon Spero 
won his singles match against 
Seth Feibelman 3-6, 6-2, 6-0, 
while junior Andrew Clearfield 
defeated opponent Jamie 
McCardell 7-6 (7-5), 6-0 to win 
the number-five singles. Carne
gie Mellon was unable to secure a 
win in the doubles competition.
It was a tough loss to Washing
ton and Lee and that will make it 
tough for us to make the NCAA 
tournament, which is a shame, 
but hopefully we can rebound
During the UAA championships over the weekend, junior Amy Staloch won all three of her singles matches.
and do well at UAAs, Clearfield 
said. I think it is reasonable to 
get second place [at UAAs].
We went into the match as the 
favorites so we were disappointed 
with the result, Spero said. We
felt that we played well in singles 
but the fact that we lost all three 
doubles matches really put us 
at a disadvantage. We hope to 
rebound next weekend at the 
UAA tournament.
The Tartans will head to Case 
Western Reserve University 
this weekend to compete in the 
mens UAA championships. The 
matches will begin on Friday and 
run through Sunday afternoon.
Tartan track and field 
teams compete at UAA
TRACK, from A12
In the throwing events, firstyear James Hulley won both 
the shot put (14.71 meters) and 
discus throw (42.54 meters). 
Sophomore Chris Fornataro 
(38.17 meters) finished in eighth 
place in the discus throw. In the 
hammer throw, Mike Reggie 
took first with a season-best 
throw of 49.63 meters. Senior 
Rory Kaclik came in eighth with 
a throw of 39.10 meters. Junior 
Chris Uhrinek finished sixth in 
the javelin throw with a throw 
of 48.77 meters.
The 4xl00-meter relay team 
placed third with a time of 
43.00, and the Tartans secured 
the championship title with a 
fourth-place finish in the 4x400- 
meter relay (3:24.31).
We didnt know we were go
ing to win until the last event, 
4x400-meter relay, Harvey 
said. It was only in the last 100- 
meters that we knew were going 
to win [the championship].'
For the womens team, firstyear Diane Mattingly finished 
third in the 400-meter hurdles 
with a time of 1:07.56, and junior 
Ashley Bakelmun took eighth in 
the 800-meter run with a time of 
2:39.76.
Sophomore Jessica Meng took 
fourth in the high jump with 
a jump of 1.53 meters. Meng 
also finished seventh in the tri
ple jump with a jump of 10.54 
meters.
In the pole vault, first-year 
Anna Lenhart placed sixth with 
a vault of 2.70 meters.
Senior Becky Metier won the 
hammer throw with a throw of 
46.09 meters. Metier also placed 
eighth in the discus throw (34.23 
meters).
Senior Lizza McGregor threw 
for 28.01 meters to finish sixth 
in the javelin throw. The 4x400- 
meter relay team (4:08.43) 
finished in fourth place, while 
the 4xl00-meter relay team took 
seventh (53.18).
The womens team missed 
some points by one or two places, 
but everybody ran pretty well, 
Bakelmun said. Im really ex
cited for the [mens team]. They 
had some great performances.
The mens team win is the first 
outdoor UAA championship title 
in over 10 years. Although the 
track and field teams seasons 
are winding down, some mem
bers of the teams will compete 
throughout May at Dr. Keeler, 
Baldwin Wallace Twilight, and 
the NCAA championships.

SPOSTS COMMENTARY
A-Rod is clutch? Not so fast, my friend
I hate to burst your bubble, but 
clutch abilities dont exist.
Doug Fricker
Alex Rodriguezs torrid start to the Major 
League Baseball season has given him the league 
lead in home runs and runs batted in, on top of 
hitting two game-winning walk-off home runs. 
Rodriguez is the first player in American League 
history to hit 10 home runs in his clubs first 14 
games. The New York Yankees third baseman 
brings up the much-debatable and controversial 
topic of whether or not athletes have the innate 
ability of being clutch.
I hate to burst your bubble, but clutch abilities 
dont exist. Rodriguez could hit four more walkoff home runs next week and I still wouldnt 
change my story. With the Yankees down by three 
runs, he could turn an unassisted triple play in
the top half ------------------------------------
of the ninth 
and then hit 
a walk-off 
game-winning 
grand slam 
in the bottom 
of the ninth 
one-handed 
while blindfolded, and I would be amazed and TiVo the re
play, but I still wouldnt say hes a clutch athlete.
Let me clarify the terminology here. Clutch 
means performing well under pressure. The 
two game-winning home runs Rodriguez hit 
were clutch because of their importance, but he 
possesses no innate ability to perform in pres
sure-filled situations. Being clutch is not some 
skill that some players possess and others dont.
Rodriguez is a perfect example to back up 
the argument. We are talking about the same 
player who last year struggled at the plate and 
in the field, was booed by Yankee fans, and hit 
rock bottom during the Detroit Tigers sweep 
of the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs. 
He wasnt very clutch then; whats different 
now? Oh I know, he took some clutch classes 
during the off-season at a nearby community 
college and hired a tutor to help him improve 
his clutch skills.
Sports analysts have studied the concept of 
a clutch play, and they were paid to do it. (Talk 
about living the dream.) Writer, historian, and 
statistician Bill James is one person who is 
skeptical of a player having the skill of being 
clutch. His argument is: How can a player who 
possesses the skills (reflexes, batting stroke, 
knowledge, experience) to be a .260 hitter in
normal circumstances magically become a .300 
hitter when the game is on the line?
Up to this point no one has found a process to 
explain this situation. Most studies done show 
theres very little, if any, carryover from one 
year to the next of a players stats in clutch situ
ations (runners in scoring position, late in close 
games).
In fact, studies conclude that a (widely con
sidered) clutch players career stats in pressure 
situations are strikingly similar to those of a 
player whos been deemed to choke under pres
sure. Apparently a clutch players reputation 
precedes him.
This doesnt stop the media from calling play
ers clutch. The Boston Red Soxs David Ortiz 
(a.k.a. Big Papi) is one such example. His perfor
mance in the 2004playoffs when the Red Soxbeat 
-------------------------------------- the Los An
geles Angels 
of Anaheim, 
then came 
back to beat 
the Yankees, 
and then de
feated the St. 
Louis Cardi
nals in the
World Series was incredible.
In case any Angels or Yankee fans have for
gotten, Ortiz first hit a walk-off home run in the 
10th inning of game three to complete the sweep 
of the Angels. Next, in game four of the Yankees 
series, with the Yankees on the verge of a fourgame sweep, he hit a walk-off home run to win 
the game in the 12th inning. In game five, he 
hit a walk-off single in the 14th inning to score 
Johnny Damon and win the game. Ortiz was 
later given a plaque naming him The Greatest 
Clutch Hitter in Red Sox History.
Ive just focused on baseball, but this same ba
sic argument that being clutch is not an innate 
skill can hold true for other sports like football 
and basketball. Joe Montana, Brett Favre, Robert 
Horry, and Gilbert Arenas are considered clutch 
players by many, yet its not as if they are all of a 
sudden better players because it is crunch time 
instead of earlier in the game.
Next time Rodriguez comes up in the ninth 
with the game on the line, dont think hes 
magically been transformed into a better player 
compared to who he was in the first inning. 
Yankees fans, you shouldnt let this news make 
you lose confidence. Regular and everyday Alex 
Rodriguez is scary enough as it is for opposing 
pitchers and managers.

Mens track and field team secures UAA title; women finish sixth
Womens tennis takes second at UAA championships; men fall at home

Whats in a theme?
From Some Like It Rough to Lure of the Sea
Carnivals most attention-grabbing element, 
the one hardest to ignore, is Midway. Midway 
triggers all the senses: Theres the smell of the 
traditional carnival foods (cotton candy and 
funnel cake, yum), the sound Of side-tent bands 
and screams from spinning Carnival-goers on 
rides, and, of course, the sight of the booths. 
These big, bright, hard-to-miss structures adorn 
Morewoods parking lot for three full days, all the 
while competing for a place in booth history, but 
theyd be nothing without the cohesion provided 
by the yearly Carnival theme.
Each year, the Carnival theme sets standards that 
ultimately manifest themselves only in a logo and 
the booths, but thats no small feat when some 
of the most talked-about Carnival memories deal 
with the years best booths. Some themes pose 
challenges for booth makers, while others offer 
more variety in end results.
" How Things Work was a great theme, because 
it gave a lot of flexibility and you saw a lot of 
variety in the booth ideas, said Cara Heller, 
a senior biology and psychology major. How 
Things Work, the theme for Spring Carnival 
2005, inspired booths that ranged from SigEps 
rock and roll booth to TriDelts magic booth, not 
to mention booths explaining the function of the 
government, diamond mining, submarines, and 
time.
For Spring Carnival, the years have seen themes 
that have been diverse in idea, scope, and 
glitz. Few themes repeat, but this years is an 
exception to that rule  Small Things Made 
Large was also the theme for Spring Carnival 
2001. Some themes have been a bit more 
straightforward, like TV Shows (1997) or "Board 
Games (1996), and others have been deceptive
in the potential of.their scopes, like New York 
City" (1980). Still, the vagueness of the more 
recent Carnivail themes is nothing new  1983's 
theme was Some Like It Rough. And while 
some themes sparkle in the very images they 
conjure, like Hollywood (1986), others are far 
less glamorous, like "Literary Themes (1991).
Each year, the Carnival Committee sets a theme, 
and each year, booths are built to follow suit. 
Some organizations have more success following 
the themes  the past few years have seen 
consistently strong performances from the Asian 
Student Association and SigEp, in particular.
Some organizations aren't remotely affected 
by the Carnival themes, though. The Activities 
Board, for instance, cant plausibly schedule 
musicians and comedians that fit themes like 
1982s "Lure of the Sea. The performances for 
Carnival are often not influenced by the themes 
set by Spring Carnival Committee, said Andrew 
Moore, a masters student at the Entertainment 
Technology Center and former AB chair. Ralphie 
May and The Shins, for instance, didnt have 
too much to do with How Things Work, and 
Demetri Martin and Spoon arent exactly Small 
Things Made Large.
Carnival themes may regulate only booths, 
but booths regulate Midways appearance and 
make Carnival what it is. Besides exercising the 
creativity of fraternities, sororities, and other 
student organizations, and sparking months' 
worth of laborious, hands-on work, the theme is 
part of what gets people to come back year after 
year  or at least to show up in the first place.

Everything you need to know
About sexy instruments and long-distance love
Dear Janet, Dear Janet,
Im graduating this year,-and my 
boyfriend, who Ive been dating 
for about a year, has a year left. 
Immediately after graduation Ill 
be starting the summer session 
of my grad school (about an 
eight-hour drive from here). We 
havent talked about whats going 
to happen between us, mostly 
because I dont know what I want. 
Hes made comments in the past 
about when we have kids and 
stuff like that, just joking around, 
but I have no idea how he really 
feels. I dont know if staying with 
him is something I want, or if its 
just the easiest thing to do.
Seriously Tired of Really Extreme 
Sensitive Stalemate
Dear STRESS,
The end of senior year is tough going. 
Honestly, I think life would be better 
served if people worried a little less 
about labels and spent more time 
appreciating their time together. That 
being said, sometimes . everybody 
needs the stability of a label.
So, what do you do? Do you stay 
with what you know and love, or give 
him up for something new? I cant tell 
you that. Just think about the drive to 
grad school. Think about how youll 
feel if youve broken up with him, 
and think about how you'll feel if you 
havent. Fornow, thats all you have 
to decide. You're not determining your 
entire future here. If you stay together 
and it doesnt work, well, thats life!- 
Remember: You dont know what he 
wants yet. You need to figure out why 
youre feeling so ambivalent, because 
thats what Im getting from your 
letter.
Were getting to that age where 
people are starting to put their chips 
on the table: moving in together, jointly 
owning pets, and getting married. Im 
not saying that you have to do any of 
these things, now or ever, with this 
guy or anybody. But if this is a guy 
with whom youd consider a year-long 
long-distance relationship, is this a guy 
you love? Is this a guy you'd possibly 
be willing to move to cities for? Is this a 
guy you might possibly want to move 
in with/own pets with/etc.? Just some 
food for thought.
Janet
Whats the sexiest instrument? Im 
thinking of picking one up, but any 
one of them takes years to learn, 
and I want to make sure I get the 
most bang for my buck, so to 
speak.
- Bass, Axe, Shred, Sax?
Dear BASS,
There are a couple layers to your 
question, so I'll tackle the surface issue 
first. What is the sexiest instrument? 
There isnt one. There's no doubt that 
there are some insidiously unsexy 
instruments (the tuba, accordion, 
and kazoo fall into this category), but 
almost every instrument, if you own it, 
can be made sexy. Even if you pick a 
more unconventional instrument for a 
rock band (fiddle, banjo, lead piano), if 
you run with it and dont look back  if 
you jump in feet first  it'll be sexy.
But something tells me that you werent 
thinking of taking up the banjo. I'm 
guessing you meant more in the vein 
of drums, guitar o'r bass, right? The 
basic three? Theyre good choices.
Quick disclaimer: I dont want to 
discourage you  I just want to tell 
you that learning an instrument is 
actually quite hard, and if the hope of 
some tail' is all thats propelling your 
studies, you may not ever get to a 
point where you're good enough to 
actually attract anyone of the opposite 
gender. And then you'll be out all that 
money and time with only the calluses 
on your fingers to show for it.
That being said, I think you should 
go for it. Personally, when I read 
your question I thought about it and 
decided that I think bass players are 
the sexiest. Then again, I realized a 
couple minutes later that Ive had 
long-term relationships with drummers 
and guitarists, so who knows. I think it 
just means that people who can play 
their instruments well are sexy. Just 
throw your heart into it.
Janet

Demetri Martin: A fans perspective
Light on the vulgarity, heavy on the passion
Last Thursday at 5 p.m., senior David Rush sat squarely in 
front of the entrance to Wiegand Gymnasium waiting for the 
doors to open. The show started at 8 p.m., three hours later. 
Unlike Rush, not all students made it to the UC Info Desk in 
time for free tickets. Some scoured misc. market, while others 
sat contentedly outside of the gym for the entire show. What 
was the big deal? One name: Demetri Martin.
Martin gained renown in the comedy clubs of New York City, 
though he is now recognized throughout the United States. 
Jon Stewart's The Daily Show features Martin in his own 
series called "Trendspotting. Hes also appeared on Conan 
OBrien's show and has a stash of much-watched videos on 
YouTube.
Martin is famous for his lack of vulgarities; his jokes are essen
tially random thoughts. Rush, a human-computer interaction 
and psychology major, admired Martin for this technique. "He 
doesnt rely on dirty jokes, Rush said. He turns the 
mundane into something really cool." Additionally, Martin'sshow is formulated around a series of different agents of 
comedy, whether it be jokes, music, or drawing.
On Thursday night, Martin touched on a variety of topics, 
ranging from absolute zero to Goths in rural areas. "I just carry 
.notebooks and think about stuff," said Martin after the show. 
"If it makes me laugh, I write it down. Martin adjusts most of 
his material according to his audiences reactions; if it makes 
people laugh, its good.
In line with this philosophy, a lot of the jokes that Martin 
presents in each of his shows are actually brand new. Every 
time he tests a line, that audience is the first to ever hear it. 
You really need an audience to figure it out. To quote Woody 
Allen, The audience teaches you how you are funny,'  he' 
said. Even though-he's been at it for a while, Martin 
continues to feel the rush of performing in front of a live
audience. [There is] part of it that will always be mysterious. 
Can I get laughs from people I dont know?"
Martin started his show with a few jokes centered around 
Carnegie Mellon  in particular, its reputation for being savvy 
in the sciences. I have to realize that Im at a school where 
I cant actually get away with a lot... He just said torque ... 
what does he think he is doing?" Martin joked, imitating a 
student.
Next, Martin performed alongside his infamous pad of paper. 
Many of his fans were used to this routine from Martins 
online clips; he uses a giant pad of paper to illustrate funny 
concepts, such as his product ideas for a baby silencer. True 
to his comedic risks, he actually draws all of the sheets 
backstage before his show  by the time Martin gets on 
stage, he just has to go with it.
Martin followed this act with a segment on his keyboard. He 
shared jokes while members of the audience bobbed their 
heads to the music, which gave the show's atmosphere a very 
original feel. Martin also plays the guitar and harmonica. He 
used these as he sang a song titled Me versus You. A song 
of revenge, "Me versus You did well to amuse the crowd. 
Throughout the tune, Martin made such parallels to 
"owning an adversary as: Me: a pigeon with explosive 
diarrhea; you: a statue," and "Me: an angry rapper; you: the 
English language."
Martin didnt learn to play to guitar until the age of 24. It 
wasnt out of passion, he explained; rather, it was to aid him 
in performances. Martins original intention was to compose 
his own scores for his comedic animations. This, for him, was 
a practical decision; it would save money in the long run.
Becoming a comedian is a big risk on its own, and Martin 
went one step further. He dropped out of law school at NYU
to pursue comedy. "It was scary, you know... I wanted to be 
a lawyer since middle school," he said. "My dad was a priest 
and my mom was a nutritionist. I didn't know any adults with 
creative jobs.
What made him take the jump? He needed to stay true to his 
passion. Though he worked hard to get the GPA and LSAT 
scores necessary for law school, Martin found the dynamics 
of graduate school overwhelming. [I had a] feeling of dread 
when I went to class that first month, Martin said. I just 
didnt feel inspired... So I thought to myself, if nothing really 
mattered  if money didnt matter  what would I do? And 
that was comedy." Besides, Martin explained, many 
occupations offer a clean slate from the start; A year after your 
job, nobody will ask you about your college GPA.
Perhaps Carnegie Mellon can take something away from 
Martins performance. Ten years from his days at NYU, Martin 
is a top-tier comedian, and all from doing what he wanted. 
Life cant just be decided by results, he said. "You have to 
be more process-oriented."
Martin is a risk taker, both in comedy and in life. To rely on 
what David Rush details as a combination of music and 
short, witty jokes, is a tough task for a profession dominated 
by vulgarity. Abandoning a pursuit dating back to middle 
school is a tough decision, but Martin made it, and his 
success is a testament to how far your passion can take you.

Philharmonic to play in Cleveland
Student musicians present all-Hindemith programOn the best of 2007
On May 3, the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic will travel 
to Severance Hall (home of the Cleveland Orchestra) 
in Cleveland, Ohio. The orchestra will play an entirely 
Paul Hindemith program, including "Symphonic 
Metamorphosis on Themes of Carl Maria von Weber, 
Kammermusik Number 1, "Five Dances from Der 
Daemon," and Symphony Mathis der Maler under music 
director Juan Pablo Izquierdo.
In considering the concert program, Izquierdo 
researched the last seven years worth of concert 
programs of the Cleveland Orchestra and found that 
the orchestra had not played Hindemith in any of those 
concerts. Seeking to stir memories of the championship 
of Hindemith by George Szell, the Cleveland Orchestra's 
music director from 1946 to 1970, Izquierdo selected 
pieces written by Hindemith in the 1920s, '30s; and '40s.
The Philharmonics trip to Severance Hall is a 
continuation of a history of successful tours, including 
two visits to Carnegie Hall in New York, the Kennedy 
Center in Washington, D.C., and Symphony Hall in 
Boston, in addition to performances at Heinz Hall in 
downtown Pittsburgh.
We want to expose the orchestra," Izquierdo said. The 
orchestras goal is to present itself to new audiences and 
to prospective students; Izquierdo called it a way of 
inviting" the best players to the university. For students 
in the orchestra, playing concerts in venues away from 
home also "enhances the learning very much  thats 
the most important thing," Izquierdo said.
The School of Music has been promoting this concert by 
posting flyers in Margaret Morrison and other buildings. 
Additionally, the university is offering free tickets and 
transportation to Cleveland (more information below).  
The School of Music has also teamed up with WQED 
Multimedia to advertise the concert. Izquierdo said that 
working with WQED has helped the orchestra reach a 
larger audience.
Attendance at Philharmonic concerts in Pittsburgh 
can be unkind. Izquierdo described a downward trend 
in attendance of Philharmonic concerts at Carnegie 
Mellon, typically held at Carnegie Hall. He said, Here in 
Pittsburgh, we have an audience thats very faithful, but 
very small.
Izquierdo feels that promotion for the concerts is lacking. 
He said, Turnout [at concerts] is not the priority of this 
institution. Perfection is priority."
In other words, why promote something that isnt 
the best it can be? The music must be perfect before 
it can be advertised. However, the Carnegie Mellon 
Philharmonics excellent concerts this season have 
done well to showcase the talents of its students. This, 
coupled with Hindemith's music, makes for a promising 
show in Cleveland.
Hindemiths music is accessible and exciting. Despite 
Schoenberg and Weberns leading music toward 
serialism (a modern musical theory, where the 12 
pitches of the chromatic scale and eventually dynamics, 
articulations, and rhythm are ordered in a particular 
way, and then manipulated) in the 20th century, 
Hindemith continued to compose in the style of a 
late-19th-century composer  a great 19th-century 
composer. "Symphonic Metamorphosis (1943) and 
Mathis dei Maler (1934) both have melodies and 
recognizable harmony, not to mention soaring string 
lines, heroic brass lines, and shimmering chords.
John Williams probably lies awake at night, wishing 
that he had written the last movement of Symphonic 
Metamorphosis, with all of its energy and forward 
propulsion.
Of Hindemiths music, Izquierdo said that for the 
players, its a joy to play Hindemith. It's very demanding, 
but with good results." Indeed, for Hindemiths music, 
you need power, precision, and good ensemble. The 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic has all of these and has 
been rehearsing rigorously. In fact, the group already 
played the Mathis der Maler at Heinz Hall on April 11. 
Overall, the Cleveland concert should be worth the trip.
The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic's concert at 
Severance Hall in Cleveland will be Thursday,
May 3, at 7:30 p.m. You can reserve a free ticket and 
transportation by e-mailing
cleveland-trip@andrew.cmu.edu by Monday, April 23. 
The bus will leave from the UC turnaround at 3 p.m.

Below is a list of the years best releases (so far).
Battles  Mirrored
Math rock meets heavy electronics. Battles is simply a powerhouse 
of talent that manages to somehow put it all together and become 
greater than the sum of its parts. This is the bands first album, 
coming out soon on Warp Records. Battles combines beautifully 
intricate guitars with intense drumming, complex time signatures, 
and vocals filtered through trippy effects. Definitely one of the most 
original releases of the year.
Blonde Redhead  23
Blonde Redhead expands on the melancholy shoegaze formula from 
its previous album and stretches things in many directions at once. 
Tracks like "Dr. Strangeluv are reminiscent of My Bloody Valentines 
guitar textures, while the horns on Sw sound like The Beatless 
Penny Lane. This will definitely be one of the pop records of the year.
Gui Boratto  Chromophobia
Borattos first full length on Kompakt is a fantastic combination 
of minimal techno beats and beautiful melodies that expand and 
contract over time. The album is great in morsels and as a whole.
Id say its also a great introduction to minimal electronics for those 
who-traditionally enjoy music with more guitars and vocals due to its 
varied sound and its luitability for both headphones and the dance 
floor.
The Field  From Here we go to Sublime 
Axel Winners debut, also on Kompakt records, is an entirely different 
affair from Borattos. The first track, Over The Ice, sticks to a twosecond loop for a few minutes. The song almost builds a wall around 
you the more you listen. I found myself getting lost somewhere in the 
middle of the album; every minute change in the music felt like an 
erupting volcano. Id recommend this release for those who are more 
eager to deal with intense repetition.
Of Montreal  Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?
Of Montreal serves up an intense, exciting indie-rock album in the 
vein of previous releases, but not without some crazy surprises. The 
standout is the completely out-of-place 12-minute mountain of a 
track titled The Past is a Grotesque Animal. The song itself is an 
intense emotional journey, which feels much more serious than the 
surrounding tracks  fun to have in the middle of the album.

Pippin returns to Carnegie Mellon
Scotch n Soda performs its annual Spring Carnival show
Carnival weekend was filled with talk of booths and buggy 
races, but there was another event to get people talking: 
Scotch n Sodas performance of Pippin. Scotch n Soda is 
Carnegie Mellon's student-run theater group  that includes 
acting, directing, costume and set design, and tech crew. 
According to director Matt Joachim, there were 85 students 
involved in this weekend's presentation of Pippin.
Pippin was originally written for Scotch n Soda in 1967 
by Ron Strauss and Stephen Schwartz, both of whom were 
Carnegie Tech students at the time. This year marks the 
40th anniversary of the original premier. "Scotch n Soda 
has a special connection with Pippin: we were the first in 
the world to produce it," said Joachim, a junior in business 
administration.
The show was originally called Pippin, Pippin, and is an 
entirely different show than we have today, according 
to music director Matthew Aument, a first-year music 
composition major. The show was rewritten for Broadway in 
the early 1970s, but, according to Joachim, the story of why 
and how certain parts were rewritten is largely speculative 
and will differ depending on who tells the story.
What is known for sure is that a new script was written 
by playwright Roger O. Hirson (WalkingHappy) and that 
Schwartz rewrote the music. While the reasoning behind 
Hirson's script is unknown, there is a basic idea of how the 
changes happened. According to Joachim, Schwartz says 
that the second act was written only after director Hal Prince 
encouraged Schwartz and Hirson to elaborate on some-of 
the title characters adventures, after seeing an audition of 
the show. Eventually, director and choreographer Bob Fosse 
[Chicago) was hired to direct the show, and some believe 
that he "significantly altered the script and added in a lot of 
the cynicism that remains in the work today, according to 
Joachim.
As promised in the opening musical number, "Magic to do," 
Pippin has elements of intrigue, humor, romance, sex, illusion,
and war. It's not the most together show," said Aument, "but 
its fun, its entertaining, and the storys cool.
Pippin began with Leading Player (senior English major 
Kami Smith), who invited the audience to enjoy the show 
in the opening musical number. Smith's voice and posture 
suggested that the Leading Player was not as innocent as she . 
seemed. The number is performed by the Players together as 
they introduce the show.
Pippin tells the story of King Charlemagne's son, Pippin, 
who is a recent college graduate. Played by first-year vocal 
performance major Ian McEuen, Pippin is in search of a 
fulfilling life, and pursues this goal throughout the play. It 
isn't until the end of the play that Pippin realizes that he isnt 
destined to be extraordinary; he chooses a simple life over one 
that's unforgettable and dangerous.
In a powerful scene, the Leading Player attempts to convince 
Pippin to participate in the final act of the show  the 
grand finale." [The] Leading Player [kind] of manipulates 
Pippin throughout the entire show so that he will perform in 
the grand finale, explained Smith. "Essentially, this finale 
is Pippin killing himself. When Pippin refuses, the Leading 
Player, now angry, orders the set to be removed and the 
orchestra to leave. The orchestral pit is exposed when the 
curtains fall, and the audience watches as the musicians 
pack up and exit the stage. The Leading Player challenges 
Pippin to "try singing without music," then leaves the 
stage. Pippin and Catherine (Pippins lover, played by senior 
English major Danielle Griswold) leave together, while Theo 
(Catherine's son, H&SS first-year Noah Levin) is left behind.
In a dark ending, the Leading Player takes the young boy as 
her next star" and a willing participant in the grand finale. 
Presumably, the story will repeat itself.
Particularly memorable scenes include Welcome Home," in 
which Pippin and Charlemagne (played by first-year music 
composition major Scott Wasserman) talk after Pippin returns 
from college; With You," where two women (played by
first-year vocal performance major Alexa Devlin and Danielle 
Griswold) seduce Pippin; and Prayer for a Duck," where 
Pippin tries to cure a young boy's duck by praying.
Scotch 'n' Sodas presentation of Pippin has been in the 
making since early February when the show was cast. 
Joachim estimates that around 800 hours of rehearsal and 
work have been put into the show  all for eight hours of 
performance. All members of the cast were expected to be 
what Joachim calls "triple threats," meaning that they can 
sing, dance, and act all at once.
Pippin was performed in Rangos Hall in the University Center. 
The set was minimal and included a throne and black boxes, 
which served at varying times as a bed, a table, chairs, and 
platforms to raise actors higher off the stage. The stage 
had audience seating around three of its sides, making for 
a technically difficult performance. The unique staging of 
this production has made every part of our tech crew have to 
overcome obstacles around every corner," explained Joachim.
All of the cast members were vocally strong and perfectly 
cast. The technical staff and pit also provided a great deal 
of depth to the show, adding creative lighting and musical 
accompaniment. The choreography was thoroughly executed 
as well, and the actors made full use of the stage. The 
directors made good use of the undertones of the show, 
as well. In "Spread a Little Sunshine, Fastrada (Pippin's 
stepmother, played by first-year BHA student Shannon 
Deep) sings and dances while holding onto different murder 
weapons, which could lead to the death of either Pippin or 
Charlemagne.
At one point in the show, Pippin goes to his grandmother 
Berthe for advice about feeling empty and vacant. Played 
by economics sophomore Alex DiClaudio, Berthe responds 
with a song, No Time at All, and the audience was 
encouraged to sing along during the choruses; some of 
the actors even danced on stage holding Pippin programs, 
which included lyrics. A college-aged male playing a

graying old lady, DiClaudio showed off his acting skills while 
embodying Berthe, who told Pippin to live a little and do some 
frolicking."
Through the rest of the show, the impressive staging, 
dancing, and singing captivated the audience. The actors 
were charismatic and energetic, keeping the crowd engaged 
throughout the show. "I have never worked with a group of 
people so set on the common goal of making one damn good 
show, said McEuen. "Matt Joachim is an outstandingly 
talented director...[and] Courtney Kochuba is a better 
choreographer than some professionals that I have worked 
with.
While Pippin was a huge success, it does not appear as if 
another alumni-written work will be produced soon by Scotch 
'n' Soda. .What is important to recognize is that Scotch n 
Soda was founded to premiere student-written work and I feel 
like we are getting back on track to producing more student 
written plays and musicals in the upcoming seasons, said 
Joachim.

Its The Odyssey, sort of.
Only its in the south, set in 
the 1930s. Sound intriguing?
The Coen brothers, known 
for their work on Fargo, The 
Big Lebowski, and Raising 
Arizona, tackle one of the 
greatest stories ever told with 
a distinctly American fl&ir.
Instead of Odysseus, we get 
three escaped prisoners, one 
of whom is conveniently named 
Ulysses (George Clooney), and 
instead of finding their way 
home, they are searching for 
buried treasure. The links to 
The Odyssey are there, but if 
youre not familiar with the story 
a lot of the references might not 
register immediately. Its still a ' 
damn good movie, and how else 
are you going to fill your weekly 
banjo quotient?
Perfume: The Story

The story looks good on paper: 
Man develops a super-sensitive 
sense of smell. Man becomes 
an expert perfume maker. Man 
starts to go crazy and kills 
women to create perfumes. 
Alright, so maybe it doesnt look 
quite that great on paper. Just 
think of it as an evil version of 
Chocoiat and youll be fine. This 
movie is based on a novel, which 
probably means the book is 
better than the movie. However, 
you have to ask yourself: Is 
watching a movie about a 
murderous perfume maker better 
than reading a book about a 
murderous perfume maker? I 
think the jury might still be out on 
that one; but seriously, according 
to IMDb.com this was rated R for 
aberrant behavior. How often 
c|o you see that?

the hot Penlope Cruz instead 
of Swayze. Cruz is haunted by 
the ghost of her dead mother, 
who has returned to fix up her 
family  and fix some hair in the 
process, while impersonating a 
Russian. Its by Pedro Almodovar 
[La Mala Educacin, a.k.a.
Bad Education), who is an 
exceedingly famous director, so 
you can almost guarantee youll 
be entertained and possibly even 
enthralled. Mystery, intrigue,

this movie atypical Friday fare; 
it might impress your date a lot

Thirty years after Rocky gave 
Sylvester Stallone his first big

screen for one last Rocky-based 
hurrah (he will be starring in a 
new Rambo picture, tentatively 
titled John Rambo, in 2008). 
While there is no Apollo Creed 
and likely dangerously low 
amounts of music by Survivor, 
the movie is essentially 
everything you remember about 
the Rocky movies. Except that 
instead of a blue-collar boxer 
with something to prove, hes a

a post-apocalyptic Earth. Nuclear 
holocaust has ruined most of the 
planet, and what little of humanity is 
left has had to struggle to survive. 
Giant monsters of both the plant

This year's Carnival theme, "Small Things Made Large, 
became uncannily appropriate in the case of the booth 
competition. Tiny problems like wind, rain, and snow became 
very large obstacles for booth-building crews. Nevertheless, 
after organizations from all around campus survived a week of 
almost every kind of weather Pittsburgh has to offer, the sun 
came out, and Carnival crowds enjoyed the nicest few days in 
weeks. Plus, the booths were done.
Travis Brier, a senior in electrical and computer engineering, 
was on virtual 24-hour alert for the week leading up to 
Carnival. As Midway chair, he needed to make sure 
everything went as smoothly as possible, and Mother Nature 
was not cooperating. Building week saw heavy winds, heavy 
rain, and even a seemingly perpetual dusting of snow. The 
winds were so intense that they caused the SDC Mudge 
blitz booth to collapse, injuring one of its builders, who was 
temporarily trapped inside.
Despite the inclement weather, construction continued 
unfettered for the most part. "I was up on the roof [of our 
booth] at 4 a.m., tarring it in the snow, said Carl Misitano, 
a sophomore philosophy major and brother of Sigma Phi 
Epsilon.
behind them as well as the masterful construction surely 
helped earn the trophy.
The brothers of Kappa Delta Rho took a different path while 
building their booth. The theme was "Inside the Human 
Body, and it was designed with a hospital motif. The games 
covered a range of different categories, ranging from a 
medical standpoint (things like "Stitch the wound!) and other 
more anatomy-based activities. Still, the stand-out feature 
was the outer construction, which looked like an ambulance. 
Jared Gargano, a senior in mechanical engineering, was put 
in charge of figuring out how to incorporate an ambulance 
into their booth. He spent weeks searching for ambulance 
scrap yards, and then outlined a plan to buy a box truck and 
modify it to look like an ambulance. When this proved to 
be too costly, Gargano checked eBay on a whim. If youre 
looking for something weird, that's the place to find it, he 
said, and find it they did: The brothers won the ambulance 
auction for only $600. Just one problem  the ambulance 
was in Philadelphia. Winning it was only the first of many 
battlessaid Gargano. Anything that could have gone wrong 
went wrong (at one point, the steering wheel even came off). 
Eventually, the ambulance arrived in Pittsburgh, and Gargano 
began the process of cutting it apart for use in their booth.
Big fun at Small Things Made

competition
The reigning booth champions at SigEp themed their booth 
after video games  specifically, classic Nintendo games.
The booth featured virtual-reality Duck Hunt as well as a 
Nintendo trivia game. Structurally complex, the booth was 
modeled after a stack of old Nintendo games, with a giant 
replica of a Nintendo Entertainment System on the top. This 
added flair fit in with the revised rules for booth construction 
put in place this year by Brier, including the possibility of 
designing a three-sided booth, as well as allowing decorative 
elements to stand higher than the 20-foot height limit, or 
to extend beyond the borders of the booth's plot, as long as 
they were more than eight feet off the ground. Misitano said 
that the brothers decided to "use the new rules to [their] 
advantage," and the added flexibility may have helped the 
fraternity win its second first-place victory in a row. The 
booth was a crowd favorite as well, and thanks to its complex 
games, the line to enter the booth was nearly an hour long at 
times.
The sororities stuck closer to the theme of "Small Things 
Made Large, with two booths about insects and two others 
about small everyday objects. Kappa Kappa Gammas giant 
gumball machine was complete with a giant inflated bubble 
up top. The booth was on the smaller side and featured games 
that were just simple enough to be easy, but still engaging.
Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta Delta Delta both themed their 
booths around the insect world, but took two very different 
approaches. The Theta sisters seriously impressed visitors 
with an intricate, towering beehive booth chock full of fun 
facts, cool games, and a beautiful lighting system that used 
white Christmas lights filtering through waxy honeycombs. 
The booth was the only other booth besides SigEp's that took 
advantage of a three-sided plot. The games included a 
"build-a-bee" game that was easy for youngsters to get into,
Misitanos dedication was echoed throughout the 
participating organizations, and what resulted was what Brier 
believed to be one of the most consistently high-quality sets 
of booths in years.
The competitive booths (booths built by fraternities, 
sororities, and several other campus organizations) were 
epically large, as usual. The brothers of Alpha Epsilon Pi 
built a two-story pinball machine, which took a relatively 
big item but recreated it on an even larger scale. Though it 
didnt create the most educational booth, AEPi was mindful 
of the time visitors would likely spend waiting to get to the 
main game on the second floor. Smaller games like a maze, 
a ball-drop, and a light-up puzzle kept those on the first floor 
occupied; the crowning glory, however, was a massive pinball 
machine made to look like Carnegie Mellons campus that two 
people could operate (one paddle apiece). The game was very 
popular and the booth was consistently crowded. The judges 
liked it, too, and the booth won a surprise second-place 
victory in the fraternity category.
Another very impressive competitive booth entry was the Phi 
Kappa Theta cuckoo clock. The two-story clock was replete 
with beautiful woodworking and looked very professional, 
while the inside featured great details like giant gears 
featuring the fraternitys letters. PhiKap used the different 
parts of the clock (like a pendulum and gears) in its games, 
which ended up being simplistic, fun, and educational.
The pice de rsistance, however, was a computer game 
in which the player had to guide a cuckoo out of the clock, 
dodging gears and other obstacles. The game used a modified, 
controller from a Nintendo Wii, and it was technically 
impressive as well as artistically unique. PhiKap won third 
place, and despite the fact that many of their games suffered  
a lot of wear and tear by the end of Carnival, the concepts

Second place went to TSAs booth, "Toy Chest. They took the 
same basic concept as ASA and went in a different direction; 
the sight of giant toys at every turn was heartwarming and 
the technical execution was admirable. The booth had 
a second-floor balcony that looked out over the rest of 
Midway, which just added to the artistic feel.
Fringe's booth.came in third, and was themed after the 
board game Mousetrap. It was simple but got the point 
across; it was immediately recognizable as the game.
It was a colorful diversion that greeted visitors as they 
entered Midway.
Blitz booths are constructed in the week immediately prior 
to Carnival. They have smaller plots than the other booths 
and are typically less complex. However, Brier said that 
the overall quality of the blitzes was better than previous 
years. This was due in part to the fact that this year, blitz 
booths were able to select themes and plots at the same 
time as all the other organizations, using the same lottery 
system. The earlier,an organization picks its theme, the 
later they can choose their plot. This year, mixing the two 
categories caused some themes to be used up early by 
blitz booths. "Everyone wanted Legos as a theme, said 
Brier. The theme went to SDC New House early in the 
selection process.
Another SDC booth took home the Chairman's Choice 
prize, which is the only prize awarded to blitz booths. 
The SDC Hamerschlag pirate ship was well-crafted and 
interesting, even if it barely conformed to the theme of 
Small Things Made Large."
and a remote-control bee-racing game for more advanced 
visitors. The Theta "Hive" won first place in the sorority 
category as well as the People's Choice award  and 
according to Brier, fell just short of gaining more votes from 
the judges than SigEp's winning booth.
The other insect-themed booth was TriDelt's "Underground 
Adventure. The booth, which gave visitors an inside look 
at a young insects birthday party, excelled in the details, 
such as the birthday presents, which were all appropriately 
insect-themed. This booth was one of the best to demonstrate 
the theme of Small Things Made Large; walking through it 
really placed visitors in an alien world that was far larger than 
it should be. The TriDelt booth took home third place in the 
sorority category, but the sisters also won the award for booth 
T-shirt design.
Other notable blitz booths included Virus Hunters," from 
the Biological Sciences Student Advisory Council (BioSAC), 
"The Big Bang" by the Astronomy Club, and ALLIES's clever 
twisting of the Small Things Made Large" theme by having a 
booth about the issue of nontraditional families (a small issue 
made large). BioSAC's booth bathed its visitors in blacklights 
and featured simple games that capitalized on the altered 
lighting for the purposes of visibility, including yellow ping 
pong balls, which would have been hard to see otherwise.
The Astronomy Clubs big bang was really just two-player 
skee ball, but they tied it to Carnival's overall theme by 
pointing out that the big bang was something very small 
that became something very large (the universe). The Open 
House booth from ALLIES was almost purely educational, 
but it was a refreshing take on the theme and on booths in 
general.
Delta Gammas booth, which explored the nooks and crannies 
of the rainforest floor, had great detail work, which kept it 
looking very much like a forest floor. The games were a mix 
of nontraditional activities, like giving visitors a chance to 
plant seeds in their own personal garden-in-a-dixie cups, 
and traditional ones, including using a slingshot to launch 
beanbag flying squirrels into holes in a tree. The booth was 
also educational, with a map showing deforested rainforests, 
as well as other factoids spread throughout. The sisters of DG 
and their booth placed second in the sorority category.
This year ended up seeing a fair amount of booth themes that 
overlapped, and many booth themes that strayed curiously far 
from the overarching theme for Carnival 2007. People chose 
creative names for their themes to disguise what they 
were, said Brier. Even so, the crowd this year was as 
big as it ever has been  possibly even larger than 
usual thanks to the good weather.
The independent category saw more playful booths; the 
Asian Student Association and the Taiwanese Student 
Association took first and second place, respectively. ASAs 
booth theme was board games," and it proved to be a 
nostalgic trip into the past with recreations of childhood 
games. Monopoly, Life, Jumanii, and Candy Land were just 
some of the games featured, and the booths game was a 
recreation of the magnetic fishing game from ages past, 
which was just challenging enough to give its players a sense 
of accomplishment.

Floating the taco. Superman steering. Bagging the course. 
King and Queen of the Hill.
This weekend, those words floated over the heads of Carnegie 
Mellon students, Pittsburgh locals, and out-of-town alumni 
at the 2007 Sweepstakes competition. After a season of poor 
weather, Buggy participants finally had plenty of sun and 
warm temperatures for race days. The crowd scattered across 
Flagstaff Hill and the intersection of Tech and Frew Streets, 
now able to catch the action on all five hills on television 
monitors. But as the unfamiliar terms and intense team 
support show, Buggy is more than a Saturday morning outing. 
Buggy involves a committee of dedicated chairs, budgets of 
thousands of dollars, sponsors, dozens of-pages of rules, and 
intense devotees. And, as its participants say, its a major but 
ultimately rewarding commitment.
Pushers, drivers, and mechanics
Erica Krivoy is considered somewhat tall to be a buggy 
driver, but that hasn't stopped her from driving for Sigma Phi 
Epsilon. "A lot of my friends are SigEps, and they needed a 
driver and I agreed to it, she explained.
Driving a buggy might not seem like something to readily 
agree to. Drivers must first be small enough to fit inside the 
torpedo-shaped vehicles. They are loaded in through the 
front of the buggy, and once strapped inside, they have little 
room to maneuver other than to use the steering mechanism. 
Drivers must pass a capability test that checks their ability 
to brake, tilt, and have at least a 90 field of vision. They 
have to be willing to spend weekend mornings in winter on 
the outskirts of Schenley Park, either inside their buggies or 
waiting in tents or nearby cars. But Krivoy, a senior physics 
major, wasn't daunted by the idea of sailing down hills or tight 
spaces. I love roller coasters, she said with a smile. And 
although SigEp didnt place in the top six for the mens races, 
she didnt mind. In her three years of driving, Ive never 
made it past second day, so it was great." Driving SigEp's 
new buggy, Pandora, Krivoy helped take the organization to 
_ finals, where they made a time of 2:19:19.
Recruiting drivers and pushers is not always as easy as it was 
with Krivoy. Senior physics major and Sigma Nu Buggy hair 
Philip Lawson described one of the hardest parts of Buggy as
getting athletic pushers." You're constantly thinking about 
it; youre constantly worrying about it," he said.
In fact, recruitment strategies vary between Greek 
organizations and their independent counterparts, such as 
Fringe, the Carnegie Involvement Association (CIA), and 
Student Dormitory Council (SDC). Sweepstakes chairman 
Michael Rem, a senior mechanical engineering major and 
a brother of Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA), said that fraternities, 
sororities, and other Greek organizations often have 
established traditions of Buggy that make it easier to generate 
enthusiasm within a Greek organization. However, most 
members of those teams are limited to fraternity or sorority 
members. Independent organizations have a greater pool 
of members to choose from, but may have a harder time . 
generating enthusiasm for Buggy.
Fringe Buggy chair Steve Huber agreed, saying, "Getting 
pushers to come out is probably at a bit of a disadvantage 
if theyre not living with you. People who offer to join 
Buggy are placed on a roster that is submitted to the official 
Sweepstakes committee roughly one month before races, 
and the final teams are then chosen from that roster. Most 
pushers, drivers, and mechanics are recruited "through 
friends, Huber said. Huber, a senior mechanical engineering 
major, was no exception to that strategy when he joined 
Fringe buggy his first year. "There were Fringe people on my 
floor freshman year; [they] convinced me to come out, and I 
liked it.
As for race day, Huber said, I was happier on the first day 
than on the second one. On Friday Fringe, an organization 
that participates in intramural sports and Booth as well as 
Buggy, finished first in the mens division with a time of 
2:08:25. On Saturday, they came in second place in mens 
and third place in womens, shortly behind PiKA and SDC, 
respectively.
Safety first
A major factor for Greek and independent Buggy 
organizations alike is safety. It can also be a crucial factor in 
recruitment and participation. The Sweepstakes Committee 
includes a safety chair. This year that position was occupied 
by Jon Kaufman, a senior physics major and a member of

Sigma Nu. Kaufman described his job as merely making 
sure that "buggies conform to the rules," which actually take 
up about 100 pages. According to the official Sweepstakes, 
rules and regulations, the safety chairman makes sure that 
all buggies and Buggy organization members adhere to the 
requirements and regulations and that the course is deemed 
safe for races. The safety chairman receives help on race days 
from the judges, according to Adam McCue, Sweepstakess 
head judge this year and a psychology major. During practices 
and race days W3VC, the Carnegie Tech Radio Club, also 
monitors the course through their Safety Net program. W3VC 
makes sure to post several of its members, armed with 
personal amateur radios, around the course to make sure that 
any emergencies or accidents are promptly reported.
Catherine Crawford, a Carnegie Mellon alumna (H&SS 02) " 
and an active member of the radio club, said that working 
with W3VC was a great way to become involved with Buggy 
on a noncompetitive level." She herself has been involved for 
nine years, and admitted that she was "addicted to Buggy." 
Crawford and W3VCs dedication was much appreciated, 
according to Rem, who awarded them the Spirit of Buggy 
Award this year. This years races were also notable for their 
lack of accidents, with only one minor crash involving SPIRIT's 
buggy Seraph.
Successes and challenges of 2007
One of the major triumphs this year, according to Rem, 
was almost unprecedented cooperation" between Buggy 
organizations. He also noted an increase in safety awareness 
and communication with the Sweepstakes Committee. 
However, Rem also said that the majority of organizations 
have entered less teams than the year before, and that there 
were fewer races this year. He credits some of that decrease to 
a difficulty for new or starting organizations to quickly acquire 
everything to be competitive: mechanics, buggies, pushers, 
drivers. It is a huge commitment to have a competitive 
organization in Buggy," he said.
PiKA took first place for the sixth year in a row, but there were 
notable performances by other organizations, particularly 
Alpha Epsilon Pi, which built a new buggy and shaved 25 
seconds off their time. Rem called this accomplishment 
unfathomable" and awarded them the Chairmans Choice
award, which earned the fraternity huge fjfelrs
during the awards ceremony. Fringe took infill111111second and fifth place with their buggies Igf 
Banyan (unveiled this year) and Bantam, 
and SDC led the womens races with the 
impressive time of 2:31.
If there were any changes Rem wished to! 
see next year, they would be incrasj 
participation and more organizati 
getting involved. I think that we, ^ 
and cmuTV and WRCT, were 
successful in increasing the 
raw number of people exposed 
to Buggy," he said. However, 
he added, the more people 
who chose to become 
involved, the better.
McCue agreed, saying,
More competition would be
Clockwise from right:
SDC races the SigEp women's 
team; a Beta pusher rounds 
Flagstaff Hill on his way toward the 
finish line; a KDR pusher prepares to hit 
the ground after several hundred feet of 
devoted running; a female PiKA pusher; the 
Fringe men's A team, which won second place.

A weekend of music at Carnegie Mellon
Touring bands and student* acts play on campus for Carnival
It was this sense of bloated mediocrity that irritated many 
a student. The band didn't have that much songwriting 
talent," said sophomore Information Systems major Steve 
Hillaneus. There was no innovation there; that bored the hell 
out of me."
What Spoon did bring to the gig on Friday night was high 
energy and a good stage presence. And when you're looking 
for a fun Carnival show, sometimes that's the best formula.
 As the band broke into older tunes like The Way We Get By" 
(from 2002s Kill The Moonlight), fans jumped, sang along, 
chugged beers, and, of course, celebrated 4/20. "The good 
majority of people enjoyed themselves, added Hillaneus. 
"They definitely did have energy.
Although Spoons music is at times mind-numbingly boring, 
its upbeat energy, simple rock vamps, and catchy melodies 
are just right for an outdoor college concert. It looks like 
campus music snobs just have to suck it up.
Oakley Hall
Oakley Hall fit perfectly as the warm-up act for Spoon. 
Dressed in denim shirts and tight jeans, the group played 
through a set of mostly country rock tunes, appropriate 
for the outdoor weather and spring vibe. Although 
the group hails from Brooklyn, its sound has more of a 
relaxed, southern feel than it does hustle-bustle. It was a 
nice big-city-meets-cornfields mashup.
"The last time we came here, there were Bunsen burners 
on either side of us, said Spoon lead singer and guitarist 
Britt Daniel. He was talking about Spoons performance at 
Carnegie Mellon several years earlier, when the band played 
in Doherty 2210, a lecture hall used mostly for engineering. It 
was clear on Friday night that the band has come a long way 
since then; Spoon's gig at the CFA lawn was packed, filled 
with Carnegie Mellon students, eager high schoolers, and 
local fans from all over the city.
The diverse fan base shouldnt come as much of a surprise, 
since Spoons music is as simple as rock music gets. The 
bands songs are often based around catchy grooves, basic 
chord changes, and poppy vocal melodies. On the shows 
opener, My Mathematical Mind, bassist Rob Pope thumped 
away at an aggressive bass line as drummer Jim Eno laid 
down an edgy blues-rock groove. The heavy rhythm section 
quickly got the crowd dancing and head-bobbing.
But then something happened. Or really, nothing happened. 
Five minutes later, the groove to My Mathematical Mind 
had not changed nor had the song structure been elaborated. 
There wasn't even a chorus or bridge. Nothing! Finally, after.a 
few verses, Daniel stepped forward to take a guitar solo. Bad 
idea, Mr. Daniel. Despite being a good-looking dude, this man 
simply cannot play guitar. His solo consisted of him twitching, 
hitting a few wrong notes, twitching again, and then cueing 
his band back to the verse.
The scenario was no different a few songs later when the 
band rocked through I Turn My Camera On." Its a basic 
indie-rock song with simple drums, Strokes-y guitar licks and, 
needless to say, a dwindling vocal melody. The only difference 
here was keyboardist Eric Harvey, who took the noise-infested 
solo toward the end ofthe song, as opposed to Daniel.
Like Spoon, Oakley Halls music wasnt particularly 
progressive, but the band's chemistry and well-crafted tunes 
made up for the lack of innovation. Rachel Cox, Oakley Halls 
backup singer and guitarist, added a nice color to the mix; 
her voice had a nice balance of smooth and grit that sat 
nicely behind lead singer Patrick Sullivans relaxed singing 
style. The rhythm section of hipster-bassist Jesse Barnes 
and Greg Anderson made for a solid rock rhythm section. 
Although no bass lines or drums beats jumped out at you, 
the two gelled well and got the crowd smiling and dancing.
Now opening for Bright Eyes on a nationwide tour, the 
band members of Oakley Hall are playing it safer than they 
probably should. They have good songwriting chops and even 
better chemistry. So, as their fan base starts to increase with 
this upcoming tour, they hopefully will push themselves as 
musicians and develop their slightly generic sound.
Weird Paul
Surprising as it may sound, Weird Paul was the nights most 
interesting act. Sure, he's not going to sell any platinum 
records any time soon, but he was the only person who made 
art that was actually provocative. A pasty white guy from 
Pittsburgh, Paul Petroskey sang songs that spanned from the 
extraterrestrial "Robot Armor to the high-cost-of-low-living 
qualms of everyday life in I Got Drunk at Chuck E. Cheese. 
His music is chock full of fuzzy guitars, cheesy drum loops, 
and really, really irritating synthesizers.
Besides the fact that his music is different, Petroskey's 
appeal also comes from the contagious fact that he doesn't 
take himself seriously. While Oakley Hall and Spoon acted like 
they were the saviors of rock music, Weird Paul just had fun. 
And so did everyone one else.

Last years Carnival concert left students in the dumps; not 
only did the poor weather force the show into the 
disastrous-sounding Wiegand Gymnasium, but the two 
headlining acts disappointed students, who were hoping for 
a more college-appropriate show. This year, however, brought 
beautiful weather, allowing the Carnival concert to take place 
at its intended spot, the CFA lawn. On Friday night and 
throughout the weekend, students, alumni, and families 
flocked to musical happenings, ranging from student bands 
to the big momma show. Read on for a review of some of this 
weekends performances.

CMU 4:30 Jazz Ensemble
Taking up its annual performance at Spring Carnival, the 
Carnegie Mellon 4:30 jazz band flexed its muscles for family, 
alumni, and students on the main stage of Midway. "We've 
played at Carnival every year for the past six years; its a great 
opportunity for alumni to hear the band, since oftentimes they 
don't get to see the concerts during the year, said conductor 
and Director of Jazz Studies Dave Pellow. The group played 
older charts from the Basie era up through more contemporary 
pieces, including Charles Mingus's Nostalgia In Times 
Square. Making the event extra special was the guest 
appearance of jazz faculty member Eric DeFade, who plays 
tenor saxophone.
Marian Mareba
Having been confined most of the semester to gigs at 
fraternities and other not-so-optimal locales, singer-songwriter 
Marian Mareba finally felt at home on Thursday night at her 
performance on the Side Stage of Midway. "Despite the hectic 
vibe of rides and games all around, the feeling [on stage] was 
much more upbeat," said Mareba, a sophomore majoring in 
creative writing. "Its different from the average show with the 
dark lights and quiet crowd." The relaxed nature of the show 
gave her room to play new songs like Burning Sky, a dark 
but beautiful tune that showed immense maturation as both a 
performer and a songwriter. Other highlights included "Cells," 
another original tune that Mareba recently recorded.
Tennessee Whiskey
Whereas some performers during the weekend, including 
Jamais Vu and Tim Dimond, focused on original tunes, student
band Tennessee Whiskey reeled in its audience 
with cover songs. Performing on the side stage, the 
group focused on classic rock, with tracks like The 
Whos Baba O'Reily, but also dipped into more 
modern tracks like Sublimes "What I Got. Were 
trying to get away from the 1970's influence, said 
singer and guitarist first-year H&SS student Nathan 
Zoob. But right now the best we can do is to get 
the crowd going, and we felt like those type of 
songs could really do that. Interspersed between 
funky tracks like "Superstition and crowd pleasers 
like "Hotel California" were original tunes that 
highlighted the chemistry within the band. 
Although instrumental and heavy in improvisation, 
Zoob said the group composes small ideas" and 
uses these as frameworks for these jams. Although 
the group is still working on its repertoire, 
Tennessee Whiskeys gig on Friday was promising 
on a level of both songwriting and performance.

Counting on bad weather
Plan B sweeps the 13th annual Mobot races
Selena Beckman-Harned | Staffwriter
The second day of Carnival dawned unexpectedly sunny, and 
robot builders across campus cursed the beautiful weather, 
which threatened to derail the 13th annual Mobot races. Its 
so bright out  which is so not Pittsburgh," said Leigh Ann 
Sudol, Ph.D. candidate in computer science, crouched on the 
sidewalk next to her robot, True, which was refusing to move. 
This is the one event where we're counting on bad weather.
To win the Mobot races (Mobot is short for "mobile robot), a 
robot must complete a 14-gate course in under four minutes. 
The course is a curvy white line, painted on the sidewalk 
outside of Wean Hall. "Most robots use video cameras, 
photoreceptors, or other sensors to detect the white line," 
said Ben Brown, project scientist at the Robotics Institute and 
commentator. The reason bright sunlight can wreak havoc 
with the robots' navigation systems is that it's much easier 
to discern the line on a cloudy day than on a sunny day when 
dark, confusing shadows loom around every corner.
The race consists of two courses joined together, explained 
Catherine Copetas, assistant dean for industrial relations 
in SCS. First, the robots must pass through eight gates 
(like oversized croquet wickets) following a curvy
painted path. Then, at the bottom of the hill, the path splits, 
and the robots have to pick the correct turns to pass through 
the last six gates (these are called "decision points") before 
finally reaching the finish line. The robots must be completely 
autonomous  their creators can only watch from the 
sidelines.
Racing mobots is no easy task. No undergraduate team 
completed the course until 2002, said Dan Bothell, alumnus 
and research programmer, who has run his robot DJB in every 
race. The simplest way to complete the course is to build a 
robot that can see the white line painted on the concrete and 
thus travel through each gate, but they're not required to 
follow the line, Bothell explained.
Past years have seen some memorable entries. Bothells 
favorite was the rat that someone had trained to follow the 
line. The race's rules allow well-treated, non-primate animals. 
The rat, unfortunately, turned out to be more interested in the 
recently seeded grass at the edge of the sidewalk than the 
race, and mechanical entries once again reigned triumphant.
Robots can be entered in three categories  undergraduate, 
open, and'exhibition. Entrants in the open category include 
graduate students, staff, and faculty. Those who just want 
to show off their robots, not run them, enter the exhibition" 
class.
Out of this years eight entries, only four robots turned out
to be functional. Ryan 
Sakauye showed the 
judges Clipboard, his 
not-quite-finished entry
(it lacked a connection between the sensors and the motor). 
I called it that because its made from a clipboard, Sakauye 
explained. Maybe Clipboard will return next year, fully 
finished.
Two robots were stuck behind the starting gate, dubbed 
Gate 0. Next to the stranded True sat Pikachu alongside its 
creator, mechanical engineering alumnus John Palmisano. 
Pikachu won first place in the open category last year, but this 
year, the little robot wasnt cooperating. Palmisano crouched 
over his laptop, frantically trying to fix the problem. When a 
bystander asked if this was the new and improved" Pikachu, 
he answered, Well... maybe not improved."
As for True, the robot was roving, confused. "It's found the 
line!" Sudol cried. "Its found the line! Its lost the line."
Robotics Institute lab assistant Jason Winterss entry, 
Ghostrider, a modified toy race car, was having trouble 
getting started as well. Winters decided to enter Ghostrider in 
the race only the day before, when he finally fixed the robots 
electrical problems. However, some problems remained: When 
Winters placed it on the starting line, Ghostrider zoomed off at 
high speed  straight into the registration table.
Bothells robot DJB, which has run in every mobot race, 
wasnt feeling up to it this year. The paperback-sized vehicle 
made it to the second gate before stalling at a crack in the 
sidewalk.
Four robots left the rest in the dust: Plan B, FIWG, and Whisk 
in the undergraduate category, and Dodgy II in the open 
category. As the robots trundled down the twisty course, 
computer science professor Greg 
Armstrong cheered them on, donning a 
kilt and brandishing a broadsword.

robots code couldnt 
handle going quite 
that fast. Still, Dodgy II 
shot down the course 
at an impressive clip.
The robot, which won
first place in the open category in.2005, might be a future 
contender to beat the course record (1:01, set by Joshua Pieper, 
then-ECE master's student in 2004).
In the end, Plan B was the only robot that managed to complete 
the course  although not speedily enough to count. But Plan 
B took home the first prize ($1000) anyway, managing 12 gates 
in 3:46: Dewey and Gannon won last year also, with a robot 
named Pajamas. Whisk came in second ($500), reaching gate 
10 in 2:18. In third place ($250) was FIWG, reaching gate 7 in 
3:41. James Bruce won first place in the open category ($250), 
his robot Dodgy II reaching gate 7 in one minute.
In previous years the competition also included MoboJoust, a 
separate contest where robots would fight to the death, based 
on the TV show BattleBots. But due to some reservations about * 
hurting the poor little robots and the disturbing tendency of 
JoustBots to fly into the crowd, the Mobot committee decided . 
to hold off on the jousting this year.
As furt as the 13th annual Mobot races were, Brown admitted 
the turnout of participants was "a little sparse." Hes 
brainstorming ways to attract more contenders, including 
a race held in the fall, or a Mobots 101 course. Brown 
underscored that the race is a great way for students to 
showcase their talent to sponsors Lockheed Martin, Harris 
Corporation, and Morgan Stanley, as well as to faculty and 
fellow students. The Mobot committee hopes to get more 
students involved across campus, including engineering, 
computer science, and even design students.

Junior Daniel Dewey and sophomore 
Joey Gannon, both computer 
science students, walked alongside 
their creation, Plan B, as it skillfully 
navigated the course. Plan A, Dewey explained, had been a 
modified RC car with a video camera mounted on it, but theyd 
had to scrap it two weeks ago due to physical problems. Plan 
B steered by bouncing four beams of red light off the concrete 
and measuring the amount of reflection  the painted 
white line reflects much more light than the concrete. These 
beams of light were protected by a sunshade of cardboard 
and egg-crate packing foam, which made the robot look, as 
Dewey said, "kind of like a sheep. The robot also featured an 
arm, ending in a "finger borrowed from a virtual reality glove, 
which counted the gates the robot passed through.
Cornell Wright, a senior in ECE, explained that he and 
Justine Rembisz, a junior in mechanical engineering, had 
built their robot, FIWG, in nine hours the day before. The 
tiny, two-wheeled vehicle featured a pair of skis that helped 
the robot manage bumps and would have come in handy if 
the race had been snowed under. Wright and Rembisz were 
hesitant to explain what their robots name stood for but finally 
revealed the secret after Brown threatened to revoke any prize 
money until they did so. It was a saying at our lab, Wright 
said. The last two words are were going, the second word 
is it; you can figure out the rest. Wright and Rembisz called 
FIWG their blitz robot since they had built it so quickly.
Somchaya Liemhetcharat, a senior in CS, said that he and < 
Jonathan Wang, a junior in CS, had named their robot Whisk 
because it sounded fast. The vehicle is basically "a laptop on 
wheels, Liemhetcharat said, with a webcam mounted on top. 
Thanks to some last-second changes to the Java algorithm 
running the robot, Whisk had no problem with the unexpected 
sunlight. At the end of each run, Liemhetcharat scooped up 
the robot, beaming like the proud father that he was.
The open class contender, Dodgy II, raced down the course 
on three wheels. Its top speed, creator James Bruce, Ph.D. 
student in CS, explained, was 10 meters per second, but the
This year's Mobot races were foiled by the 
good weather, which made it more difficult 
for the robots to detect the white course 
lines on the sidewalk outside of Wean Hall.

Is Buggy worth all the hype?
Overall no, but it really helps to cure general apathy in our 
school. BD
Buggy makes me really nervous, and I cry a little about it 
sometimes. I mean the concept of buggy is just odd to me.
A little person  like myself  driving this little thing while 
huge men run and push it? Im really confused. Im also about 
to have a panic attack. RC
Did you enjoy this year's Booth theme, Small Things 
Made Large?
Yes, but Carnival Committee really needs to work on its logo. 
BD
This one seems too similar in concept to How to be a Kid 
Again, and just happened in '01. Possible themes for Carnival 
are infinite, so why not choose something a little more daring, 
unique, or specific? KL
Which was your favorite booth? Which was your least?
Any booth with a ball pit or the giant pinball machine; the 
refrigerator. BD
SAE's battleship was pretty cool. Also, I definitely didnt mind 
seeing a giant ocarina (once I learned what it was). I don't like 
picking least favorites. SM
I liked Betas... thing (booth?). Simple, modest, punchy. MS
What was your most romantic Carnival, moment? What 
about your most embarrassing?
I was with a friend at a side-stage show, and he was talking to 
me about a professor pretty loudly, so I could hear him over the 
music. He continued talking, and when the music died down,
 all the entire crowd heard was, "...GREASY HAIR! KL
Ha, romantic? My friend who has a boyfriend proposed to me, 
and she gave me a ring with a K on it. My name is Rachael 
though. Embarrassing? When I fell off a seat at Ritters while 
trying to eat my bacon cheeseburger. RC
Watching a boy and girl toddler dancing on Midway. Man,
I wish I could dance. I was pretty embarrassed when I tried 
dancing with them and they made fun of me. MS
I proposed to Rachael Clemmons on her bed while I was 
dressed like a six-year-old ballerina. She totally said yes. KC
What was the best part of Carnival?
The best part of Carnival was definitely the food. Fried Oreos 
and funnel cakes are the best. AC
Finally getting to party! KL
What was the funniest thing or person you saw at 
Carnival?
I didnt actually see it, but a friend of mine saw a llama on 
Forbes Avenue. He took a picture of it. LS
Demetri Martin. Hands down. KL
Which was your favorite stage performance, both main 
and side? Your least favorite?
Marian Mereba rocks my world with her electric blue guitar. 
Literally, sometimes. RC
Anna Vogelzang was amazing, and she was amazing last 
Carnival, too. SW
Spoon was a little too mellow. I like their music, but I was 
disappointed in the live show. KC
Did you watch any musicals or plays? What did you 
think of them?
I saw Pippin, and I thought it was fantastic. The actors, tech 
staff, pit, and everyone else involved did such a good job in 
putting the show together. AC
Suggest a theme for next year.
Oblong Things Made Rectangular. LS 
Presidential Candidates. LK
Reading Rainbow: Everyone uses a story of some sort and 
makes a booth! BD
Cereal! How sweet would it be to see huge boxes of cereal on 
Midway, like Lucky Charms or Trix. Okay, just kidding. KL
[Things] in a Box. SM
How are you going to survive these last two weeks of 
classes?
Work. Drink. Realize that it's almost over and that I might as 
well do the best I can without complaining too much about it. 
LK
Im going to nurse this hangover. Actually, its gone. Im going 
to sleep a lot, and Im going to hurt a lot of people and Im 
going to be inspired by Walking to the Sky for all my poetry 
and fiction pieces. RC
Caffeine pills, caffeine drinks, energy bars, and an empty 
wallet. KL
Hopefully some sunshine therapy. Come on, Pittsburgh. -KC

Carnival top fives
Hangovers, bands, and everything in between
Did you know?
Another Carnival, another compilation of top-five lists 
about the hots and nots of this fabulous weekend  that's 
right, we're seriously channeling Rob Gordon here. Lets 
kick things off with the five best aspects of this years 
Carnival:
5. Spoon. Phenomenal and so much better than Phantom 
Planet. I dare you to openly disagree with me on this one.
4. The alums. I missed some of yall. Good to see you 
again!
3. The rides. That unlimited rides thing on Thursday 
was 10 different kinds of fantastic. I know these are 
around every year but nothing compares to stuffing 
yourself with funnel cake and then spinning around until 
you puke.
2. The booths. Whether you spent day and night on 
Midway building one or scampering in and out of all of 
them over the weekend, you probably had a good time.
My personal favorites were the giant cuckoo clock (Phi 
Kappa Theta) and the gumball machine (Kappa Kappa 
Gamma).
1. The weather. Did.you venture outside this weekend? 
Im starting to strongly suspect that there may be a team 
of maniacal engineers building a weather machine in the 
seedy underbelly of Wean. Five bucks to anyone who can 
prove me right.
Top 5 Carnivalicious Hangover Cures
The only problem with a theme such as "Small Things 
Made Large is that the drinks tend to come in large, extra 
large, and magnum sizes. Actually, this is not a problem, 
but the morning after is a different story. Whether you are 
a Carnival-bender veteran or a tenderfoot holding on to 
that toilet bowl for dear life, here are five ways to make 
that bumpy ride a little smoother.
5. Dont drink caffeine. The diuretics will only 
increase the dehydration, making your head hurt worse.
4. Sleep it off. Sure, you have Tear-Down at three, but 
you might as well just nap til then. It's not like youre
going to be oh-so-productive anyway.
3. Stop drinking for a while. This may seem a tad 
obvious, but a little restraint goes a long way.
2. Banana milkshakes. I suppose I could make up an 
explanation, but can't you just take my word for it? It 
works. Really.
1. Greasy fries and a bacon cheeseburger. This is 
where the 'O would come in handy... and an unwrecked, 
loving, compassionate roommate whos willing to go pick 
it up for you.
Five bands that I would love to see at Carnival
I love Spoon. My last.fm account will tell you that I listen 
to them fairly often (It will also tell you that I listen to the 
Backstreet Boys, but that's irrelevant. And a secret.) and 
Im glad that AB managed to bag them. I really am. But 
if I had had my way, these are the bands that wouldve 
rocked Carnival 2007.
5. ABBA. Matching jumpsuits. Unrivaled choreography. 
Hot Swedish chicks. Need I say more?
4. Rammstein. They're large, German, and a little 
intimidating, but v/e'd totally be the most hardcore school 
in the universe.
3. Justin Timberlake. This one has nothing to do with 
my love for music, just hormones.
2. 2gether. Remember the MTV boy band parody that 
was actually better than most of the actual boy bands? 
Remember calculus? You know, You + Me = Us? Yeah, 
them. Not only musicians but shrewd scholars of the 
human condition, these are the men who keenly observed: 
"The hardest part of breaking up is getting back your 
stuff.
1. Journey. Thats right  Im serious. Likeanyone 
wouldnt want to chill on the Cut listening to "Dont Stop 
Believing. In the words of the incomparable Adam West, 
I love it when amateurs sing the lyrics.

The Promenade Committee suggested that 
the engineering societies select a corner 
of the dance hall and decorate it with their 
insignia and colors on prom night. This, they_ 
hoped, would solve the decoration problem 
and be a unique feature. Sounds like a great 
plan. Except why would anyone want to go 
to a prom after high school?
According to one Tartan writer, the start 
of Carnival put an end to the incessant 
questioning of first-years about what to 
expect. Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 
annual event with many a jovial student 
enjoying the time off from formal classes. I 
sure bet those lucky little lads and lassies 
learned some life lessons, though! Also in the 
news, many students absent from Monday 
exams, suffering inexplicable headaches and 
retching.
Organizations proudly named their buggies. 
Here are some of the years entries: The 
Cyclone, Falcon, Streak, Diffusion, Flying 
Buttress, Leroy, Pegasus, Blue Haze, Dj 
vu, Black Mgic, Black Death, White Witch, 
White Lightening. The less successful entries: 
Slow Death, Not Yet, Shadow, Solar Shadow, 
Land Shark, and Python. If youre going to 
name a buggy, at least name it something that 
sounds fast: Cheetah, Gazelle, Autobahn, or 
RUNYourPantsAreOnFire.
Carnival was underway and there were 
activities for all audiences: Pika and Fringe 
placed first and second, respectively, in 
both the mens and the women's buggy 
competitions. Delta Upsilon, Kappa Alpha 
Theta, and the Asian Student Association 
won for booth. Others participated in Holi 
and slip and slides. It was one of the few 
times that year that the majority of Carnegie 
Mellon students were not busy at work.
An officer responded to reports of a rowdy 
fraternity. Upon arrival, the policeman saw a 
stuffed chair on fire on the patio  while the 
brothers of the house attempted to beat it with 
boards and douse it with water. It was 4:24 
a.m., and the brothers stated that a cigarette 
or something had accidentally dropped on 
it and set it alight. The house was issued an 
internal citation for the external fire.
Five people staged a protest outside of the 
Collaborative Innovation Center. One was 
banging on a drum and another was using 
a bullhorn. Their plan, they told the police, 
was to be stationed there for a few days. 
They had a permit for both the bullhorn and 
the drums. Now that is some responsible 
collaborative innovation.

---------------------------------------------------

Nine simple steps to succeed post-Carnival
Improve your term papers during these last few weeks of classes
5. Stick with what you know
Keep it simple, stupid. If you dont know proper 
semicolon usage or the difference between i.e. and e.g., 
dont try to learn now; trust me, youll screw up, i.e., fail. 
Stick with the basics youve known since grade school: 
Use simple vocabulary  errr, words  and end every 
complete sentence with some kind of punctuation.
6. Divide and conquer
Heres a really easy hack: Use descriptive subheadings 
at the beginning of major sections or ideas. Put them on 
their own lines and make sure they say something more 
informative than "My first point. Subheadings tell your 
reader whats coming, make your document easy to scan, 
save you the trouble of thinking up slick transitions, and 
take up space that you would otherwise have to fill with 
more original thoughts and ideas. Win win win win.
Its like cheating, but it looks smooth and classy  like 
Ocean's 11.
7. Abuse cognitive psychology
Heres a list of Beatles albums: Abbey Road, Rubber 
Soul, Yellow Submarine, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, Let It 
Be. Now, repeat those albums without re-reading them. 
You probably had no problem recalling the first and 
last items, but got a little muddier with the ones in the 
middle, right? Thats how memory works: The first and 
last items stick better. You can abuse this fact to make  
stronger-looking arguments. Say you have three pieces of 
evidence that support your thesis. Two are very strong; 
one is just OK. Put the weaker one in the middle when 
you write your paper. The reader will focus more on the 
points that you put first and last and your paper will look 
better. Its science.
8. Fix the little things that instructors hate
Dont forget page numbers. Please run spell check; it 
takes like five minutes. Graders go ballistic when they 
see the words "very unique." Youre means you are 
while your signals ownership. Check your paper.before 
you turn it in to unearth a bunch of other typos that got 
lost in the fog of coffee and tears.
9. Chop it down
Run your text through the Online Clich Finder 
(http://cliche.theinfo.org) to find worthless phrases like 
leave no stone unturned or "pursuit of excellence and 
eliminate them. Finally, try this exercise: Attempt to cut 
your paper in half. When you believe with conviction that 
every single word adds something valuable and cannot 
be removed, turn it in. Youre done.
Lee Reamsnyder | Staffwriter
Your writing sucks. There, I said it. And its not because ' 
youre an engineer or in computer science  I simply 
think that if your name isnt Faulkner or Joyce or Eggers, 
you're probably not writing the next great American 
novel. Nothing personal.
Unfortunately, in the coming weeks, no matter what kind 
of class project you've been working on, you'll almost 
certainly have to write about it. Fact of life: You could 
have the best idea in the world, but if you cant write a 
decent paper about it, your QPA is boned.
Im here to help. Ive suffered through courses in 
grammar, style, and professional writing so you dont 
have to. Heres a list of tips and tricks you can use to 
easily write papers that will earn a better grade without a 
lot of extra effort.
1. Write an outline first
I know. Youve heard this so many times that it has lost 
all meaning. Well, is it really that crazy to think about 
what you want to say before you write it down? Just get 
a piece of paper and jot down some of your ideas and 
thoughts. Ten minutes of thinking could save you hours 
later on.
2. Love your writing
David Kjos | Art StaffTeachers basically guess how long your paper should be. 
Ignore them. Trying to fill that page count will probably 
leave you with a paper of, well, filler. They want to see 
how you think,- not read 20 pages of hot, steaming 
garbage. State your thesis, provide your evidence, make 
your conclusions, and get out. Youll write better if you 
don't stress over the length. As the Drive-By Truckers 
say, "Just cause I dont run my mouth dont mean I got 
nothing to say. Also, avoid double negatives.
4. People Do (Things)
Remember this: People do. Sometimes, People do 
things. Subject, action, maybe an object. In that order.
In probably 90 percent of your sentences. The circuits 
failed. We repaired them, is so much clearer and 
cleaner than, The circuits, having previously failed, 
were repaired by us. There, I fixed most of your writing 
problems and took you from a C to a B+ just like that.
Although I just told you that your writing sucks, you need 
to love it. You were involved with this project or research. 
You want to. show your professor evidence of all your 
hard work. You should take ownership and responsibility. 
Put yourself in the paper. Use I" and "we" liberally. 
Handwrite your name on top. Leave a lipstick mark on 
the paper. Whatever it takes to feel proud of your writing.
3. Ignore the page or word requirements

Ha Jin Choi | Art Staff
Earth Day happened  did you care?
Carnival had a whole weekend; the planet only gets one day
Although one shouldn't expect the Carnegie Mellon website 
to have Google-esque illustrations for each holiday, the home 
page included only one reference to Earth Day (which was 
Sunday, April 22), in the form of a School of Design poster 
competition. Its mention also was absent during Carnival.
Is Earth Day really that important? Originating in 1970,
Earth Day aims to raise awareness of the plight of the world 
environment. Concerning many issues from human health 
to habitat destruction to the fashionable global warming,
Earth Day remains a low-key event year after year. This is 
a long way from the original Earth Day 37 years ago, when 
20 million demonstrators and thousands of schools and local 
' communities participated. But with A1 Gore winning the 
Oscar for Best Documentary Feature this year, one would 
expect that Earth Day would receive more attention.
Though Earth Day may not be overtly celebrated, the 
university does not fall flat on its face. In a study conducted 
by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, which releases 
reviews of campus and endowment policies at universities 
throughout the country, gave the university a C+ for its 
practices. However, the breakdown of results indicated that 
this less than stellar performance was largely due to issues of 
investing its limited endowment.
Awareness on campus is growing through programs such as 
Eco-Reps said Alexa Huthof the Green Practices Committee. 
E co-Reps are students living in dorms who educate peers in 
their house community on how to live in a more sustainable 
way. The Green Practices Committee, which consists of 
faculty, staff, and students, oversees university environmental 
initiatives. All new university buildings, for example, are to be 
LEED-certified, a standard of building sustainability.
Green Practices was responsible for installing solar panels on 
South Craig Street. It has set a goal of providing 20 percent 
of the university's electricity through renewable resources
(largely wind and landfill gas) by 2008. The university also 
takes part in RecycleMania, a recycling competition among 
peer institutions. Still, Carnegie Mellon has yet to place in the 
top five in any of the categories.
Carnegie Mellon is also home to student organizations that 
support environmental practices. "I think people are aware 
of recycling, but that's about it. People pay little attention to 
other things like their carbon footprint [how much carbon 
dioxide they emit through fossil fuels]," said Andy Stocchetti 
of Sustainable Earth, a student organization that works 
to raise awareness of environmental issues. Stocchetti 
continued, "People don't care."
But has Carnival brought attention to issues of the 
environment at all? Earlier this week we had tree planting, 
where we gave away seedlings in plastic bottles. We used 
that to raise awareness," Stocchetti said. We put most of our 
focus [to raise awareness] on RecycleMania."
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship invited Care for Creation, an 
evangelical group that focuses on environmental stewardship 
from a Christian viewpoint, to speak on campus. Ed Brown, 
executive director of Care for Creation will present a lecture 
"Jesus and the Environment," which will take place in the UC 
Connan Room this Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. An urban farming 
lecture, with Penn States Bill Lamont is scheduled for the 
same day at 5:30 p.m. in UC Rangos.
There were several events off campus such as Saturday 
evening's second annual Environmental Film Festival, 
presented by the Sierra Club in Phipps Conservatory's Botany 
Hall. Several of the films related to food issues. The Carnegie 
Science Center had Drive Cleaner, Drive Greener for its annual 
Earth Day festival.
Academically, the university also offers a multitude of 
environmentally focused courses (over 100 in total across all
university colleges), like the department of Engineering and 
Public Policys Energy and the Environment and Air Quality 
Engineering. New York Times columnist and author Thomas 
Friedman once called for every college engineering student to 
be required to take one course in green design; the university 
has taken steps in that direction.
Carnegie Mellon, along with the University of Texas at 
Austin and Arizona State University, established the Center 
for Sustainable Engineering in 2005. With the support of 
the National Science Foundation and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the center promotes the incorporation 
of environmental considerations into engineering designs 
satisfying future demands (imagine the environmental impact 
if everyone around the world had American standards of 
living), while using the Earth's resources more efficiently.
The university's attention to environmental issues does not 
stop there. The Carnegie Mellon Green Design Institute is 
an interdisciplinary research effort focused on improving 
environmental quality through green design. The University 
of Pittburgh's Mascaro Sustainability Initiative hosted  
Engineering Sustainability 2007: Innovations that Span 
Boundaries, on April 15 through 18, 2007 with Carnegie 
Mellons Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education 
and Research.
Is all this enough? "We can definitely improve [awareness], 
and that is my mission and that of Green Practices, Huth 
concluded.

Everything must go  and you should too
Future Tenant hosts work by second-year MFAs
Running through Thursday, April 26, Future Tenants 
Everything Must Go exhibit features the work of six 
second-year Master of Fine Arts candidates from Carnegie 
Mellon. Though the title might sound more like a closeout sale 
than a gallery exhibition, Everything Must Go is something 
else entirely. The translation is literal; everything must go 
(i.e. function), and the visitor is the one that has to make that 
happen.
For an installation called "Lost broadcast," MFA student 
Eileen Maxson placed a podium full of microphones in one 
of the windows at the front of the gallery. Visitors are invited 
to step right up; when they speak, they are effectively 
addressing the street. This setup presents a contradiction: 
Though the speakers are in plain view of the public, they are 
silenced by the glass window.
Behind the speaker hangs a bright blue curtain, making the 
setup look real  almost. If youre looking at the podium 
from any angle besides head-on, you can see past the 
curtain and into the gallery, and the artifice is revealed. The 
effect is intentional, Maxson explained, and in line with the 
Everything Must Go mentality that in order for things to go, 
you have to first see how they work.
Once inside the Future Tenant gallery, its hard to miss 
the open black umbrella  hopefully spinning, but that all 
depends on visitor involvement. The umbrella is part of a 
piece called Stormy Weather: Nomadic Experiment #2" 
by MFA student Ally Reeves. "I try to make things that get 
me talking to people," said Reeves. And thats exactly what 
Stormy Weather does; throughout the opening, Reeves 
fielded questions from visitors: "What do I turn? Where do I 
look? Is that part from the inside of a music box?"
"Stormy Weather" is art on wheels, vaguely resembling a 
street cart  Reeves even built in a cup for donations. (A 
man with an accordion alongside a dancing monkey would 
not seem out of place.) Moreover, the piece is meant to travel,
and Reeves plans to take it out to Schenley Parkin the future. 
"So far, its only crossed the street," she joked, explaining 
that Stormy Weather" is only a couple of weeks old. At the 
front of Reevess piece are two eyeholes, which give access 
to a two-dimensional landscape inside of the cart. As the 
crank turns, the umbrella spins, the bells ring, and the interior 
landscape also animates-, creating an effect akin to The 
Science of Sleep, a film Reeves cited as an inspiration for her 
work.
Over the chimes of Reevess Stormy Weather, you can hear 
thunder and rain  either that, or metal sheets and grains of 
rice. A Storm At Sea, by fellow MFA student Ben Kinsley, 
implores visitors to animate a scene and create its sound 
effects. Come on, I need your help! You!" Kinsley shouted 
from behind a partially drawn curtain in the back of the room. 
Here, visitors turned cranks, sifted rice out of a colander, and 
flapped thunder sheets to create a tempestuous ocean scene, 
which was projected on a screen on the other side of the 
curtain.
I was doing these live videos with little props ... and I really 
wanted to add sound to it," Kinsley said. For A Storm At 
Sea, he researched the techniques used by old radio shows 
to create the same effect.
Slightly less demanding of the visitor was MFA student 
Michelle Fried's "Ulceration, a video project starring herself
 and her stomach. Its about a reoccurring stomach 
problem, Fried said. In its whimsical, exploratory style, 
"Ulceration is something like a cross between Being John 
Malkovich and an episode of The Magic School Bus. Fried, 
suffering from an ulcer, ventures inside of her stomach, where 
she discovers  and destroys  the offending ulcer. Shots of 
"Ulceration also include the stomach personified, which Fried 
constructed out of papier-mache.
In its final moments, the ulcer blasts off the screen in the form 
of a comet, which Fried described as a personal symbol. On a
deeper level, she said, "Ulceration" is about finding the root 
of a problem.
Everything Must Go had its official opening last Friday 
evening to coincide with a gallery crawl in the Cultural 
District. About 1800 Pittsburghers visited Future Tenant 
during its four-hour opening, according to co-director Abigail 
Santner. We obviously love the crawls, said Santner.
Santner is an arts management student, part of a 
interdisciplinary program between the Heinz School and 
CFA. Since 2002, arts management students from Carnegie 
Mellon have been running Future Tenant year-round. "'[Future 
Tenant] is a. really amazing place for our program as arts 
managers," Santner said. Were a multi use space."
The gallery has hosted installations, performance art, one-act 
plays, and even a hockey game (sans ice) back when the'
NHL was on strike. For art students to put on a hockey game 
is pretty unusual, but people seemed to enjoy it," said Jerry 
Coltin, director of the arts management program. Future 
Tenant has a distinctly unfinished interior (bare ceiling, 
concrete floor, and walls halfway between plaster and brick). 
"When we saw it, it was a lot worse than it is now, Coltin 
said. "There arent too many spaces like it around."
However, in a couple of weeks, 801 Liberty Avenue may soon 
begin to blend into its surroundings. According to Coltin, 
Future Tenant is in for a move. Coltin is unsure of the gallerys 
upcoming location, though he suspects it will be within a few 
blocks of where it is now. A coffeehouse will most likely take 
Future Tenants place on Liberty, Coltin said. "It really is a 
pretty resilient space," he said. Over time, I think we grew to 
love it. But, like the exhibit says, everything must go!
