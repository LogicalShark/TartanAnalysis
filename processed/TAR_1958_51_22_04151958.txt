NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTAS
On April 23 there will be a meeting between Carnegie 
Tech officials, and representatives of the Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare in Washington to discuss a 
proposal made by congressman James G. Fulton, Jr. of this
city. The proposal concerns the transfer of the U.S. Bureau
of Mines property on Forbes Street to Carnegie Tech. Ac
cording to the plan, the property ?------------------------: :------
would be given free, and the Budetails regarding a transfer andreaus operations would be trans
ferred to Bruceton in Snowden 
Township, where most of the bu
reaus activities are being carried 
on at present. Mr. Fulton added 
a condition to his proposal that 
Tech increase its faculty so that 
the new facilities can be used to

expand enrollment in the College 
of Engineering and Science.
With regard to the plan, H. 
Russell Bintzer, Techs vice presi
dent in charge of planning and 
development stated, The discus
sions thus far between Tech and 
the Bureau have been purely of an 
exploratory nature. We merely 
have tried to see if the buildings 
could be had if the Bureau ever 
decided to move. We have not 
gotten down to a point of specific

ment as yet.
President Warner had this to 
say in a letter to the Congress
man, Your proposal would be of 
far-reaching benefit to Carnegie 
Tech and the thousands of stu
dents who look to us each year for 
j undergraduate and graduate edu
cation. I commend you on your
I action in behalf of higher educa[ tion and offer every assistance 
with the power of Carnegie Tech 
to achieve the results. President 
Warner added that the mines 
property would help solve Techs 
serious space problem in its en
gineering, science, and research 
programs.
The new buildings would en
able Tech to accommodate from 
700 to 1000 more students as part 
of the antional expansion in sci
ence and engineering education 
and would be in line with Presid e n t Eisenhowers scholarship 
program, which is designed to in
crease the number o fstudents in 
these fields.
The Bureau of Mines property 
includes a main four-story build
ing with six separate buildings be
hind and considerable free space 
for parking. The Mines Bureau* 
Headquarters has a scientific li
brary of 30,000 volumes which 
should be of great benefit to sci

THE POSTMAN COMETH
I have recently received several letters from readers which 
have been so interesting, so piquant, so je ne sais quoi, that I 
feel I must share them with all of you. The letters and my 
replies follow:
SIR:
Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years 
ago. On my very first day I got into a bridge game in the 
student union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never 
gone to class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do 
is play bridge.
To explain my long absence and keep the money coming 
from home, I told a harmless little lie. I said I was in medical 
school. This made Dad (my father) terribly proud. It also 
enabled me to keep playipg bridge. We were both very happy.
But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended when 
I came home for Christmas vacation. I arrived to find that 
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen. 
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was 
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by 
a hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.
Oh, never mind, chuckled Dad (my father). Harlow (me) 
will fix Sister (my sister) 
Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a 
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging 
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school 
which would be a dirty shame just when I am beginning to 
understand the weak club bid.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. I got Sister 
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself completely 
at a loss as to how to put her back together again. Can you 
suggest anything? Theyre getting pretty surly around here.
Sincerely,
\ Harlow Protein
Dear Harlow: 
Indeed I do have the solution for youthe 
solution that has never failed me when things 
close in: Light up a Marlboro! Knots untie as 
you puff that fine rich tobacco. Shade becomes 
light as that grand flavor comes freely and friendlily through that splendid filter. Who can stay 
glum when Marlboro gives you such a lot to like?
Not I. Not you. Not nobody.
SIR:
Just off the campus where I go to school there is a lake 
called Lake Widgiwagan. Thirty years ago when my father was 
an undergraduate here he went fishing one day in Lake Widgi
wagan and dropped his Deke pin in the water. He dived for 
days but never found it.
Just yesterdaythirty years later, mark you!I went fish
ing in Widgiwagan. I caught a four-pound bass. I took the 
fish home, cut it open, and what do you think I found inside?
You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dempsey-Firpo fight.
Sincerely,
Willis Wayde

Some Editorial Thought
Faculty, Students, READ!!
By Michael Kennedy 
Notre Dame Scholastic, December 6, 1957 
WHAT IS A TEACHER?
This is a question that we must ask ourselves, not only 
because some of us will become teachers in high schools and 
colleges in the future, but also in order to understand the 
kind of relationship that exists or should exist between teach
er and student. What must a teacher be before his students 
what should his attiude towards them be?
Because a teacher is an artist with a very special material 
to work with he must have % special attitude towards the in
tegrity of this material, the human personalities under his 
care, as well as something to express it in. What distinguishes 
a really great teacher from the plentiful scholars who have 
a large store of knowledge and perhaps even the ability to 
express it intelligently? Ithink the first and rarest attribute 
is love for his students; not only willingness and respect, but 
love. Students can get their facts and theories, their culture, 
from many teachers; indeed if they have the will they can 
get culture from books without the help of interference of 
other agents. But only teachers with love can make them 
wise, and if they can glean a measure of wisdom from the 
other, loveless offerings then it is only through their own un
guided efforts.
The question should be askedwhat is a student? This 
has been discussed quite often and the answer should be well 
known. But it is doubtful whether the teacher can love stu
dents who are really not studentswho, instead of enthusi
asm for learning, have only the desire to learn as little as 
possible while fulfilling the requirements for a degree. There 
must be love on both sides; on the part of the student, not 
only love and .respect for the teacher, but, more basically, 
love of wisdom. That this is not always present in the modern 
student is, perhaps, not entirely his fault. It may be that the 
same loveless scholars are to blame. It seems that they cre
ated grades and degrees in large part to insure the preserva
tion of their positions among the elite of intellectual society, 
and now the degrees are necessary to any man before he can 
teach in college or even in most high schools.
The ideal situation might have been possible once: the 
combination of love and wisdom in a man makes him in
evitably a teacherhis wisdom attracts learners around him 
and by love he calls forth their enthusiasm and puts them in 
a state of mind to become wise because he is wise. Plato tells 
us that Socrates did so, and perhaps the great universities of 
the Middle ages were built around such men. Even now there 
are some, but they are hampered by the system forced upon 
them, and we cannot now come to them as children eager to 
become men.
Teaching is creation and an artperhaps the greatest, 
most awful, most ofter profaned of the artsbecause the art
ist's material is not canvas and paint or words, but it is his 
own human kind that he shapes and determines, not charac
ters in a novel but real lives. It must be that those who pre
tend to teach, who DARE to teach, without live for their stu
dents or awe for their own art, do not realize the full re
sponsibility or consequence of their position. Scholars who 
can make their living in no other way than by teaching in a 
university and do so only for that reason are not really teach
ers. They have no wise song to sing except to themselves.
(Editors Note: The above article is reprinted because it ex
presses so well an academic spirit which must manifest itself in 
the heart of every individual participating in the educational 
process at Carnegie and from there flow over into our relation
ships with one another. This may seem rather ethereal to many 
engineers and hard-headed individuals, but a mans reach 
should exceel his grasp or hell never grow in ability or achieve
ment. This academic spirit is generally missing from the lives 
of Carnegie Tech students.)

Fall-Out Ban
Editor, The Pittsburgh Press:
The New York Times of March 
17 reported a suggestion of Dr. W.
F. Libby, a member of the U. S. 
Atomic Energy Commission, to re
strict atomic bomb tests by means 
of an international pact. Such 
pact would bind the different na
tions not to exceed a certain pre
assigned quota of fall-out radia
tion.
Dr. Libbeys idea of introduc
ing fall-out quotas is very inter
esting and worthy of public sup
port. .
With this constructive sugges
tion Dr. Libbey recognizes the 
possibility of a workable agree
ment on atomic tests; he departs 
somewhat from his previous atti
tude according to which any 
agreement was meaningless since 
the Russians would explode their 
bombs in secret.
As long as we cannot find a 
way of stopping them, we must be 
resigned to the fact that both the 
Russians and Dr. Libbey might 
explode their bombs in secret. But, 
by all means, let us stop .them 
from contaminating the air which 
we breathe and the food which we 
eat. Let us start controlling those 
explosions which produce fall-out 
and which, therefore, cannot be 
hidden.
It is easy to establish the quota 
of fall-out allowable to each na
tion: exactly zero.
Dr. Libbeys suggestion, with 
the proviso of a zero quota, could 
become a strong weapon in our 
psychological battle with the Com
munists. We have here the occa
sion of taking that initiative that 
so often escapes from our hands. 
Our government could be the first 
to make the commitment to stop 
contaminating with radioactivity 
the atmosphere of other nations: 
at least as long as our own at
mosphere is not contaminated 
from sources beyond our border.
Such a move would increase our 
prestige in the world and improve 
our internal position more than 
any test. It would not weaken us 
in any manner since our atomic 
bombs are already sufficient to 
destroy the world; furthermore, 
our pledge would end if disre
garded by our opponents.
A commitment to stop contami
nation could be undertaken today, 
since it requires no agreement 
with anybody, no trust in any
body. It would be a challenge to 
the Russians, and to their peace 
propaganda.
If, despite our cessation of fall
out producing tests, the Soviets 
were the first to contaminate the 
air anew, they would be exposed 
before world public opinion.
If, on the contrary, they ac
cepted our challenge to sensible 
behavior, a first step on the road 
toward sanity would be made.

Buggy Seminars?
Editor, the Tartan:
The shroud of secrecy which 
surrounds the buggy races each 
year defeats one,of the purposes 
of this event. Even within a fra
ternity few members khow any
thing about the design and en
gineering of the buggy. A few 
very interested people spend 
weeks working on their contrap
tions and schoolwork suffers mea
surably. I would like to propose 
a buggy symposium in which 
every fraternity participates to 
discuss the theoretical aspects of 
buggy design and the possible im
provement of the racing condi
tions. Safety measures and course 
maps could be discussed, and much 
unnecessary individual work eli
minated. Several buggy chairmen 
have exhibited interes. in this 
type of program and they do not 
represent the*losing fraternities. 
Interested fraternities may con
tact me through Box 275 or the 
Tartan.

Observations
Why Does The VS 
Assume The Defensive?
By Richard Block
Today the United States is deep in a marathon, 
chasing the Soviet Union along economic, scientific, ^
and various other tracks. Our goals are primarily 
to catch up with the Russians in some fields and 
keep up with them in others. We scrutinize their 
economic plans, we speculate on their rpilitary po
tential, we try to anticipate their next sociological 
move, and so forth. The general concensus would 
seem to be that we are behind.
What country has the largest number of peo
ple getting higher education? asked Khrushchev 
in a recent Hungarian speech. Answer, the 
U.S.S.R. What country sent the first sputnik into 
the cosmos? They were socialist sputniks. Who 
wants to overtake whom in science? - The United 
States of America would like to overtake the Soviet 
Union?
Higher Education
The answers to the first and third of these 
questions are meaningful. The second is of dubious 
value. Youll note that Khrushchev said getting 
higher education not people in college. While 
we have more people in colleges we have in
finitely fewer receiving higher education. { (
And yet I ask, why are we so defensive? Why 
cannot we act objectively and independently? Why 
must we base so much of our action and reaction 
upon Soviet movement?
Counter Soviet Russia?
Programs good for themselves and good for 
United States objectives and prestige are invari
ably sold to Congress and the country primarily 
as measures to counter Soviet Russia. For example:
Secretary Dulles asked the senate foreign relations 
committee to approve the foreign aid program #
on the grounds that Moscow was making pacts with
16 non-Communist countries for a total of two 
billion dollars in economic and military aid.
Deputy Undersecretary of State Dillon asked 
the house ways and means committee for a fiveyear extension of the reciprocal trade program 
because the Soviet Union was using trades as a po[continued on page 5]
Letter To The Editor
Block Superficial
Editor, The Tartan:
For the past few weeks the readers of the Tartan have 
been subjected to the observations of Richard Block, and al
though his writing shows the imaginative workings of a wel^ 
intending mind, the latest products were a little too rash and 
unthinking. I admire the attempt to instill some curiosity other
than alcoholic, athletic or sexual^-----------------------------------------------
into the thoughts of Tech students, I scream to the wor]d that he doeg
but this is hardly an excuse to 
present rather impetuous and shal
low opinions in print. The author, 
I feel, does not completely under
stand the responsibility that he 
assumed when he undertook to 
write his articles.
Way of Thinking 
I think Dick Block falls into a 
wsfy of thinking that is too com
mon among Americans. We have 
a habit of thinking that our freedooms and democratic privileges 
are possessions and inalienable 
rights, ours by birthright and not 
to be earned by effort on our part. 
This is not correct. Our right is 
one that allows us to earn a free
dom of speech; our freedom is one 
; by which we limit our freedoms. It 
j is impossible to imagine complete 
freedom for this would be com1 plete chaos.
The word freedom has very litj tie value in itself; it only has value 
j when we lack itnot when we 
; possess it. We are an amazingly
lucky people to have the choice 
that we do; when we choose to 
limit our freedom, it is by a free 
choice not forced by an oppressive 
state or economy. We, for the most 
part, never had to earn this free
dom and we take it for granted, as 
we do our right to free speech.
Personal Integrity 
This then leads me to examine 
what this right entails. Does the 
very fact that any man can open 
his mouth and utter sounds give 
him this right? Is it the right to 
blaspheme and play the dema
gogue or the Menckenite? Does 
the fact that some fool would
not believe in God shpw anything 
but a terrible misunderstanding 
of what the concept of God means 
to the human race? We can ac
cept the right to free speech, but 
not without accepting the responsi
bility to use it wisely. It is a mat t 
ter of personal integrity. And in
tegrity is what makes man heroic.
You might wonder why I have 
written all this for it seems that 
this type of attitude is the same 
one that interests Dick Block; at 
least he seemed to be in favor of 
it in his last column which attack
ed the abuses of the McCarthy 
era and the misinformation of our 
present age.
Well, that much seems certaij * 
he seems to be for a correst 
way of presenting facts and 
for a protection of our right to 
free speech. But his words belie 
his hopes. The columns during the 
past few weeks have been excel
lent examples of the misuse of this 
right and perhaps of the right of 
free press too. '
Historical Truth
Benedetto Croce thought that 
historical truth had to be detei I 
mined by placing the historical 
facts in their proper context of 
time, mood and place. Only then 
could the truth of a situation be 
approached. When one then ex
amines the causes of the Span
ish American War, they might 
appear to be somewhat different 
from the farce and glory and the 
territorial expansion that at first 
glance might appear obvious. And

General Twining, chairman of

fo*4 retaliatory capacity against 
Soviet aggression. (The right

Dont for one minute think that 
we should not pay any concern to

wise to watch and counter an op

depend upon what They do.
Blessing in Disguise
Many people have said that the 
Soviet first in satellite launch
ing was actually a blessing in dis
guise for it woke us up to the 
needs of our present system. Why 
on earth should we have to have 
our necks literally threatened in 
order to realize that we are stag
nating in the status quo? Why 
should our only provocation for 
improving our education system 
be to catch up with the Russians? 
Why should we be satisfied with a
grossly inadequate schooling sys
tem until we find out that we are 
behind the U.S.S.R.? Is war, or 
the defense against war the only 
cause to which Americans will 
contribute their tax money? If it 
is then we are living with sadly 
distorted values. Is there no pride? 
Is there no self-appraisal?
The Navy is now buying singleengined jet fighter planes costing 
$9,900,000 each; the F-8U3. Ima
gine how much could be accom
plished if for every one of these 
planes bought, the government 
would give the same amount to

Tartans Defeat Jeannette Harriers; 
To Meet St. Francis Wednesday
Carnegies track team won their^ 
first dual meet of the season by 
upending the Jeannette Harriers, 
a track club of ex-college stars, by 
a score of 69 Vi> to 46^.
The Tartans proved extremely 
strong in the running events win
ning every one of them except the 
low hurdles, but on the other hand 
were weak in the field events as 
they have been in preceding years.
The phenomenon of the meet 
was 45-year-old Russ Thomas of 
Jeannette who was National Decathalon champion some twentyfive years ago. Thomas, in excel
lent physical shape won the broad 
jump, shot put, low hurdles, and 
took second in the high hurdles. 
Poor Weather
The meet was run in a cold rain 
and the track was extremely mud
dy accounting for the poor times 
turned in, in several of the runn
ing events.
Eric Ottervik and Dick Hamil
ton are going to prove a hard 
combo for other teams to beat in 
the mile and two-mile events. 
They won both events yesterday 
in easy fashion and should go 
through the season in the same 
manner.
Freshman Ty Porter won the 
100 and 220 yard dashes and also 
ran an excellent leg in the mile 
relay event. Ty should prove a 
mainstay on this years team.
Veterans Eric Suggs and Bill 
Whitman won the 440 and halfmile events respectively in good 
times, while Milt Miles copped a 
first in the high hurdles.
Coach Jim Farsons troops are 
looking forward to their first West 
Penn Conference meet next Wed
nesday against St. Francis of Lorretto. The meet is a home event 
and a good crowd is hoped for if 
better weather appears.

Printing Courses 
Will Be Offered 
In Summer School
Summer school courses in print
ing and printing management will 
be offered by Carnegie Institute 
of Technology in a six week ses
sion running from June 23 to Aug
ust 2 this year. They will be un
der the direction of Professor R. 
Burchard, Assistant Dean of the 
School of Printing Management.
The program will include skilldevelopment courses in typog
raphy, principles of production, 
layout and design, machine com
position, graphic arts processes, 
presswork afid photolithography. 
It will also include management 
courses covering estimating and 
cost analysis, accounting and sta
tistical controls, sales organiza
tions, operation analysis, and a 
management seminar.
Fees
Fees for individual courses 
range from $43.20 to $64.80; stu
dents may take any number of 
courses. An applicant will be ac
cepted without regard to previous 
education, training, or experience, 
if he feels he is capable of hand
ling the work. Applications may 
be made to the director of the 
summer session at any time be
fore classes begin.
The summer printing classes, 
Professor Burchard points out, 
are identical with those of the 
regular academic year. They carry 
college credit and offer the same 
advantages of Carnegies modern 
printing facilities and profession
al faculty. They provide an excel
lent opportunity for printing 
teachers, employees of commercial 
printing plants, and others involv
ed ir graphic arts work to acquire 
new techniques, refresh old 
knowledge, and increase earning power.
Cafeteria and dormitory facili
ties are available on campus dur
ing the summer session.

Tech Football 
Shows Promise
The Tartan football team has 
been working out for over a week 
as Coach Eddie Baker is putting 
them through spring training 
drills.
The team has been given a 
break by the weather and few 
practices have been called off due 
to the usual spring rains. Again 
coaches Hirshberg, Burns and Ir
win will assist Dr. Baker in bring
ing the team into shape.
Sveral lettermen return from 
last years team to bolster especially the line positions from tackle 
to tackle, and halfback positions. 
Returning linemen include Love, 
V a n T y n e, Hammer, Chalupa, 
Temmel, Benner, Yarborough and 
Kohan. Backfield veterans are 
Zinni, Majeski, Muth, MacElhennie, Doxtader, Jones, Luppi and 
Wilson.
Dr. Baker .can be very optomistic about next years team and 
Tech should prove a strong power 
in the West Penn Conference. 
There will be an eight-game foot
ball schedule which includes only 
two contests with West Penn Con
ference members  Geneva and 
Westminster. Unfortunately Tech 
will not be eligible for the WPC 
championship.
Block[continued from page 4] 
this is the basis of my complaint 
against the Block-analysis of 
world affairs. His is a static inter
pretation.
It exists at one instant of time 
and from only one point of view 
and that view is sometimes pain
fully shallow and uniformed. We 
can validly deny that Harold 
Stassen was fired for speaking his 
mind; he was fired for being un
able to understand his position. We 
can deny that Americans are 
force-fed platitudes and halftruths and generalized false in
formation because they eat only 
what they want to and they have
the opportunity to get as correct a 
picture of their country as no 
country ever before.
Sensitive and Rigorous
Only they have to work for it; 
they have to be intellectually sen
sitive and rigorous. They cannot 
allow themselves to swallow halftruths just because so much in
formation is available. They must 
have sensitive digestive systems, 
able to selectively vomit away 
that which reeks of oversimplifica
tion and undersophistication.
What about Dr. Edward Teller? 
Is he the crude and blustering 
man that was presented to us sev

make an original contribution to 
a field that exists in a rarefied at
mosphere inhabited only by the 
most sensitive and understanding 
of intellects. He realizes the full 
horror of the implication of nuclear 
war for he helped in the develop
ment of the first atomic bomb and 
willingly shared the blame for its 
misuse.
But the bomb was built 
Teller himself pushed the develop
ment of the even more destruc
tive hydrogen bomb. Did he do 
this because he dwells in sadism 
and wants to unleash this holo
caust on the world? Or did he 
realize that upon the control of 
this ultimate weapon rested the 
fate of the free world? He knows 
what totalitarianism means and 
he does not have a short memory. 
He can remember the past failu^ i 
of weak free nations in their strug
gle for peace. He knows the Rus
sian menace and he cannot forget 
atrocities like the recent Hun
garian Revolt as some can in their 
wishful thinking of a peaceful 
world.
Stakes High
The stakes are high nowthe 
fate of the free worldand Dr. 
Teller knows this as well as any 
man. The solution is not in ( e 
cessation of atomic tests, for even 
if they could always be detected, 
what could one nation do to pre
vent another from testing their 
bomb? What except start a war 
to end all warsto end all civiliza-, 
tion. All we can do is to remain 
strong and hope the stakes are 
high enough that countries can 
forget ideologies and nationalistic 
drives and combine finally into 
one international human rq )i. 
Appeasement of double - edged 
Russian proposals can neved do 
this. They want to control the 
world; we mfist keep it free 
this is our destiny.
Dangerous Thing
Knowledge is a dangerous thing. 
In the hands of those who do not 
know how to use it, it becomes a 
force for evil. Facts are like build
ing blocks; they require a welltrained man to transform them ivio 
meaningful things. And they &Ai 
be arranged to form an internallyweak and false structure, no mat
ter what the intention was that 
set them in place. Dick Block cer
tainly has the material, but he 
has not yet shown any deep in
sight into the construction of a 
meaningful order out of it. There 
are many faces of a brick as there 
are many ways of looking at facts. 
It would be worth his time to ex
amine them.
I do not think that his brand of 
freedom of speech is a good thing; 
it lacks the refinement of a rigor
ous critical examination; in short, 
it lacks good taste. If he wants to 
speak his mind, ' nothing and I 
mean nothing, can stop him in this 
country. But if he wants to be re
spected for what he says, he ought 
to examine his words and inten
tions more carefully. When he 
asks why we are not demand! 
our right to free speech, I can only 
answerWhy arent we earning 
it
