Rushing Rules Nothing 
- - But a Compromise
D
EAN TARBELLS latest refusal to grant 
the requests of Interfraternity Council 
is-conclusive proof that he is entirely out of 
sympathy with the fraternity system at Car
negie. Instead of helping he hinders. The 
Councils requests were entirely- reasonable. 
Fraternities should be allowed to contact men 
in the halls provided they enter no classrooms.
. . -. And there is no reason why the dean should 
Object to fraternity men entering the rooms of 
freshmen. .ba reasons are weak and uncon'Vineing.
Rushing rules are not representative of the 
'desires ' of Interfraternity Council. They are 
 compromises between the Council, which has 
.to take what it can get, and the dean who has 
some decidedly strange ideas about the frater-. nity problem which he claims to be familiar 
. . with, but his actions show him to be entirely 
unsympathetic. j
His attitude shows that he is unaware of the 
'.contributions which fraternities make to the 
: moral, social,- cultural, and residential life of 
~ Carnegie students. If Dean Tarbell does not 
care to handle the fraternity situation then the 
-Administration should secure another man who 
can co-operate sympathetically and construc
tively with Interfraternity Council.
. Ideals Are 
Grand ThingsTjpHREE hundred representatives of sixty 
jjjfl.''fraternities attended the National Interfraftermty Conference in New York last week. The 
 purpose of these' representatives was to trans' -late lit recognized fraternity ideals into action. 
V Briefly, these ideals are: first, to create fra'terhities in accordance with the aims of the 
college in which they are located; secondly, to 
impress'fraternity men with their primary loy
alty to the college as a group^; third, to pro
mote conduct consistently with good morals 
and taste; fourth, to create' breach chapter an' 
atmosphere of intellectual achievement; fifth, 
>~.:-.to promote sanitary and wholesome conditions 
r-in.all fraternity buildings; sixth, to inculcate 
j -sound business methods,in managing them.
Ideals are grand things. It is a wonder that 
- some enterprising Tushing chairman didnt 
have a copy of these words hung on the walls 
of. his fraternity.
 In-the fraternity that you and you and you 
want to join, these ideals will not be hung in 
i .. i>laui.tsight.',' .Ypu-ll have ..to dig t discover 
. them. In your digging, you might uncover a 
. few skeletonsmark them well! If you dont 
find the ideal you seek, consider your chances 
for creating that ideal and making your bunch 
 adopt it.
Season or War? (
;^,;|ri:LAMOROUS rushing season with its dia: >J, bolical unreality .and flexible rushing
t . rules brings forth both extremes of quality, in 
jr ; fraternities. Idealism of interfraternal bonds 
:-3;-:,5:folishly stilted by jealousy and unsports'^VTtianlike rivalry which tends to quicken the uiiereurrent of ill-feelings, that has 110 place in 
^'vfeternity circles. Why is such poor spirit 
Vi >?: displayed by fraternity men during this pev l-^iod: Svhen of all times their mutual interest 
should dictate greater congeniality and respect 
for each other? Could it be that thev fail to 
..realize the value of a more altruistic view
point? Certain it is that the superior social 
, culture, upposedly symbolic of fraternity men 
r-. .^general,- is sadly eclipsed by their belligerent 
feelings toward each other. Their gentlemen 
bvvvagreem^nts, rushing rules, are broken so fre/quently that eventually the old system of an

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?
Last year we sighed with relief ae we viewed the prize-winning'picture of the International. No traditions had been violated. The picture was the type everyone eapected to win; it was the type to excite people, to make th'em express opinion, to deride the judges, and, in general, to  make the Exhibition famous. .Peter Blum has another Jigsaw picture in this year's exhibit and there are other paintings which' are deserving of prizes, but what happens? You may tell us that Mussolini has abandoned Ethiopia and we will not be astonished, you may inform us that Little Annie Rooney escapes ,for good;,irom Mrs.;Meany and we will not be surprised; but you cannot make us believe you are anything but a prevaricator when you tell us that this year's prizewinner is one which cap be understood at first glance! How does the committee dare to depart from accepted standards In choosing the prize picture? Do they not know that this logical and level-headed attitude which they have adopted will only bring oblivion to tbe Exhibition? Do they.Lhink the reputation of the International so well established that they can bo prosaic about the slection of prize-winners and yet have'people Sock to see tKelr choices? Can they 1
being skeptical, donned our squeaky shoes visit the exhibition and satisfy ourselves that there had been a mix-up in the newspaper office and a pboto of Joe Louis and his bride bed been placed under the wrong heading. We stood before the prize-winner in amazement, unable to move,, and, as happens before sbop-windows when one pauses to gaze into them, a mob Immediately crowded about us, pushing and shoving in nn endeavor to discover what we gaped at. Had we found the traditional mystery of the prize-winner? Had we found that for which they had hunted for daysthe unreal quirk
ed natural; we particularly admired the real- ness of the string of beads she wore and the almost photographic clearness of detail. The crowd bared their teeth at us; they had expected one of our* serious demeanor, one who studied the picture with such apparent concern, to. find at least some fault with it, some unreal bit
their thoughts. We pointed out faults galore in the second prize-winning picture. We orated on the stiffness of the trees, the falseness of the coloring.. Still the ominous muttering continued. Wo pointed out the flatness and ugliness of the third prize picture in comparison with the other sea picture in the exhibit
What were we going to do? Obviously our position was a ticklish one. Not only was our- person In danger, but our reputation as a great . art critic was toppling. We could find nothing wrong wlththe prize picture! In desperation we turned once again to the picture. The figures were not grotesque; the subject w&b not impossible; the details were splendid. Certainly this picture was not deserving of a prize. Of all the ;mnterfal from which the committee might have made a selection, why did they have to choose Ihe only painting with which we could find no fault? There must be something wrong with It of course. Something that even we could not fathom, but what? Why could they not have chosen one more obvlousTy ;absurd like the Garden Areoplane Catcher" "r th ham-and- eggish "Napkin Ring? What prize-winners theyd have been!The. murmur of the crowd Lad become a roar rage. Mobsters tore at our garments and
perate glance at the prize-winner. The picture is too large for the canvas, we hazarded. They were satisfied.

THE ROVER BOYS AT THE ART EXHIBIT
Where have you been, my dear Roscoe? asked the sweet little old lady by the window, laying down her knitting and. gazing with delight on the fresh and noble countenance before her ' Roscoe Royor. a perfect snecimnn of >1 that 19 best In American young manhood, wiped his
with the simple dignity that' made him the joy ' of his schoolmates and the Ideal of his friends, Mother, I have been to the Art Exhibition!The mention of religion brought the little lady
paintings of landscapes and of the sea. George liked It, also. Did you not, Goorge?, Rosette's,1brother, who had-.entered the room at -  that moment,' declared that he :had enjoyed the I- exhibition Immensely.Yes, continued Roscoe, and how amusing was the picture which was awarded the first prize! It was of two blackamoors seated upon a sofa. They were adorned and dressed like white people.. I thought it a bit futuristic.Roscoe!
Roscoe had the good grace to blush and to be?
Rover sighed. I suppose It is that school which you .attend,"' 3he said. I'm sure you never heard your father or me use aucli language."Oh, no, no, protested both the boys and each promised to abstain from all such obscene words in the future. Roscoe moved to the window and covered his face with his hands. His handsomp, manly form made all the young ladles who dwelt across the street and who gazed out of the win- dow to catch a glimpse or him, swoon with Joy. He turned to his heat and flung It at her feet as he promised to forego the tainted speech of college life.
Mrs. Rover felt that her son was punished enough and drew him to her to kiss his noble brow.  George, whose mlschievlous nature was his gravest fault, tried to relieve the tension of the situation by crying, and Mother, how Roscoes shoes squeaked! Everyone started and
'stared" at "liar".......................The young men continued to describe the paintings and of the wonders of the art galleries, their bright eyes glowing. So eager were they to impart thteir observations to their mother that they occasionally forgot themselves so far as to interrupt each other, but always, upon . realizing .their .breach of . etiquette, they each stopped and begged forgiveness of the other and ' Roscoe, being the elder, proceeded with thetale.When they came to the end of their breathless adventures in the galleries,-Roscoe produced 1
tlie book. had been looked through 'In slleuce. For answer Mrs. Rover picked up her knitting needles and-plunged them, into .the-hearts of each of her beautiful sons. As their rich, red life-blood spurted over , her lap,, she . cried, God forgive me, but'they who are rutned. are better , dead, for at: least thev can not now contaminate others-with their obscene, knowledge of life'   VIRGINIA-MATHER

CANCER CURE 
What may prove to be another 
milestone towards cancer cure has' 
been uncovered by Dr. W. F. Bruct 
Instructor and research worker In 
the chemistry department of Cor
nell University. He has Isolated a hydrocarbon called metbylchlora f thene, whose ability to Initiate cancer he demonstrated positively when pursuing an Investigation be-1 gun by English scientists on the I
Iywood than In Alaska, said Fathej Hubbard, the Glacier priest and geologist. In an interview at Syra- University. Furthermore, ot the S,000 Eskimos in this northern section, not a one knows whs Igloo looks like. And as for . the.ther, why its colder here In Syracuse than in most parts of Alaska. In Juneau, the capital, tbe low- temperature ever recorded i-s six below, and In the summer, it varies between 50 and 80 degrees. 
Father Hubbard Is prominent for s contribution to geologic study in 1931. when he trapped chlorine gUB from the eruptions of an active volcano. This discovery led to the be lief that loss of life in volcani. iptlons is often caused by chlor 1 content in the volcanic action Among his experiences <n Alaska.told of descending into *n active volcano, where the temperature rose to 1080 degrees Centigrade.

The Italian Caus  Editorial
Appearing in This Weeks . i Issue
Presenting the Italian Cause
' (Editors note: The follow- . lag article -was -written by a night stndeDt of Italian extraction/ -who amended military school in Italy prior to entering Carnegie. The Plaid -would welcome a similar article pre* senting the Ethiopian side of -.-tie.iquestlon.)
Patrick' Henrys famous expres
sion, Give me liberty of give me 
death,? is somewhat remodeled in 
Italy.today, where the cry is, Give 
. os land, where we can employ our
selves In a good deed for the good 
of mankind or give us death." This 
is the story of a people who must 
find a place to emigrate. None of 
that fantasy one reads in the pa
pers' ahout Italian Imperialism in 
Africa. That fantasy, I am sure, is 
in no Italian heart today. "What Italy 
wants is what any living people would want if they were Uar position. Italians dont like wars, but since war is the only way, out, why not light? History tells''us that Italy has contributed ijiuch toward civilization and-civil- ' ization does not favor wars but  civilization falls to see the Itallai side, of needed expansion. The ; Italians thus must jflght because to fight is to live and to live 1_ 4-flSht.
. .The League of Nations covenant ' has prevented Mussolini from asking for what he wanted In Ethlopa, El? that to start the war he has v blamed the Qctions of the Bthio- i- plana os being detrimental to Italian, interests on the Eritrean frontier. The covenant of the- League of Nations was made Just to protect ' certain interests and not to pre- yent .wars. The covenant, has worked for awhile but experts ; international affairs are of the opinion that its end Is near. The .. League, of. Nations, is only a private - tribunal where one states his : case and then admits he is right arid the rest are wrong.UV,There  are only three financial unite .in the world today, namely he British Empire, Franco and out . 'own United States. Germany and- ,? Italy do not figure as such. In ' .Germany, Hitler has expelled the
Jews and made room for some Germans. In Italy, however, which Is chiefly populated by Italians there is no one to expel and so .it becomes necessary for Italy to expand beyond her borders. Italy haB a total area of 117,982 square miles and a population of 45,000,000. England has a Parser population but she also has a greater area.
Mussolini is really a man of ac* 
tlon, and selfishness Is not a part of his make-up. He believes in glv* ing everyone a chance to prove their worth and for this reason the 
Italians are 100 per cent behind him. Likewise he has the Italians such a high pitch that even his political enemies are admiring him. Regardless of the consequences, Mussolini feels that war is the only mean* of solving his problem- p the League of Nations refuses to recognize the right of Italian
Italy has been a major influence to civilization and it Is impossible to keep her In the background any longer. Fifty nations, many or them under pressure, agree that

that if it were' not for Fascism, Italy would be a Bolshevistic na* tlon today. Italy has been censured for breaking treaties but what about Japan, Germany and the

Mussolini cannot be bluffed and eventually Italy will conquer Ethiopia. Italy not only failed to receive her just sharo of the /war spoils following the last world conflict but the very nations which ehe assisted are now campaigning against her. To the Italians, name such as Mussolini has match In world history and they feel that anything he does is for the good of the nation. The Italian people not only , have faith In
