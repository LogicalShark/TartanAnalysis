Drama Dept. 
Is Presenting 
The Vultures
Production Directed By 
Graduate to Obtain 
Higher Degree
PLAY FIRST GIVEN 
IN FRANCE IN 1882
French Court Procedure 
Attacked; Family Life 
Also Portrayed
"The Vultures," a play written 
by Henri Becque, opened last night 
in the Little Theater under the di
rection. of John F. Sollers, a grad
uate student in the Department of 
Drama. This production Is being 
offered by Mr. Sollers to satisfy 
in part the requirements for his 
Masters Degree in Drama.
The Vultures represents one of 
the most important steps in the 
history of the naturalistic move
ment in France and has become a 
lassie of modern French drama. 
The play was first produced in 
Paris at the Comedie Franaise in 
1882 where it was very coldly re
ceived. Later it met with great 
success and has become-part of 
the permanent repertory of the 
Comedie Franaise. The play lias 
seldom been produced in America 
and probably never before in Pitts
burgh.
Like Brieuxs The Red Robe, 
the play is an attack on the court 
procedure in France. It pictures 
the Vigneronsa happy, prosper
ous, bourgeoise familywho are 
rendered without guidance by the 
death of the father. The family is 
helpless in the hands of supposed 
friends and well-wishers who to
gether with a horde of other vul
tures proceed to plunder the 
estate of the widow and orphans.
The delineation of characters is 
especially interesting in providing 
interesting examples of the dra
matic technique employed by a 
French pioneer in the naturalistic 
drama. No one could forget the 
lovable Papa, Vigneron, who ap
pears only in the first act and 
whose chief pleasure is to be alone 
with his family. The Vultures 
developes quietly like many Amer
ican plays dealing with middleclass life, turns to satire and irony, 
and uses melodramatic situations 
to promote intensity.
The cast is:Mrs. VigneronJean 
Dahl ; Blanche VigneronMary
ann Miller; Judith VigneronMar
jorie Eshleman; Marie Vigneron 
Henrietta Siskin; Mr. Vigneron

the present season.
Since his appearances on the

many engagements at popular 
dance spots throughout Pennsylva
nia, Ohio, and New York, including 
fourteen weeks at the Showboat in 
Pittsburgh; eight weeks at Waldeman Beach in Erie, Pa.; twelve 
weeks at Celeron Park, Lake 
Chautauqua, N. Y.; two weeks at

Despite the popularity of the 
orchestra and its reputation
Those who plan to attend 
both the athletic contests 
and the dance Friday or Sat
urday should check their 
wraps in the Thistle Hall 
check room. Entrance may 
be gained to gymnasium 
through Thistle Hall.
Sorority Formal 
Will Be Feb. 24
The intersorority Formal, fourth 
major affair of the spring semester, 
will be held at the Pittsburgh 
Country Club on Friday evening, 
February, 24. The formal is given 
by members of the four sororities 
at the College of Fine Arts.
A reduction of seventy-five cents 
has been made in the assessment, 
tickets being priced at $2.75, in
stead of $3.50 per couple.

cause of the large attendance ex

both dances will remain at the 
customary $1.00 per couple. Stu
dents of Duquesne University have 
been invited to attend both dances, 
and the members of the Duquesne

be admitted free of charge.
The custom of formal attire at 
the boxing matches, so popular -at 
last years affaiis, will be continued 
this year. Ringside seats will be 
reserved for those who wear formal 
dress. This custom is being uni
versally adopted for collegiate box
ing matches, and it is felt that 
formality of dress , lends a dignity 
to the college matches a contrast 
to professional bouts.
The dance Saturday night will 
be mainly formal although formal 
dress is not necessary. Dancing 
will start both nights at 9:00 for 
couples who do not attend the ath
letic events and will continue until 
1:00 Friday and 12:00 Saturday.
New spotlights have been or

been completed by the time of the 
dance Friday night. A new deco

will add to the pleasure of those 
who attend the dances.

COUNCIL ADVISER
Allen E. Risedorph, instructor in 
the Department of Physical Educa
tion, has consented to assume the 
position of adviser to the Inter
fraternity Council. In this unoffi
cial position Mr. Risedorph will 
act as a liaison between the ad
ministration and the Council. 
Pertinent questions affecting the 
fraternity system can thus be re
ferred directly to a member of the 
faculty.
At its meeting Saturday, the In
terfraternity Council discussed the 
advisability of having a uniform 
Hell Week. At present Hell Week 
for the twenty-one social fraterni
ties is scattered over a period rang
ing from three to four weeks. The 
Council, by concentrating Hell 
Week over a definite period for all 
fraternities, seeks to obtain a cer
tain degree of cooperation from the 
administration in regard to scho
lastic work.
To establish the eligibility of 
their pledges, fraternities must 
send to the secretary of the Coun
cil, W. P. Hoffman, a list of pledges 
carried over from last year and or 
new men pledged since and during 
rushing week. The names are to 
be in by Saturday morning, Jan
uary 28.
All intramural competition will 
be handled in the future by an In
tramural Board consisting of three 
faculty members, three Council 
representatives and one dormitory 
man. Professor Edmond Esquerre, 
Mr. Risedorph, and Mr. Frank W. 
Moses are the faculty men. The 
following Council representatives 
were appointed: Charles C. Schatvt, chairman; Roland E. Land and 
George O. Myers.
President James Stahl appointed 
a , committee to confer with Mr. 
Risedorph on the revision of the 
Constitution of the Interfraternity 
Council. Bernard I. Everson and 
William Burns compose the com
mittee.
The Contract Bridge League lias 
been dropped until the beginning 
of the new semester, when a plan 
will be presented to the Council.

Maggie Murph Overwhelmed With 
Overnight Appearance of New Door
By ANNA LADD
Another door:
Last Spring, May 24 to be exact, 
an article appeared in the Tartan 
which was headed like this: Un
manageable Doors on Campus 
Bring Envy, Wrath, Chivalry In 
Students. As the article went on 
and on enumerating all the trouble
some doors on the campus there 
was one particular paragraph that 
took my eye: Another door which 
almost excites us to wrath is the 
front door to Maggie Murph. 
Theres something queer about it; 
we dont quite trust double doors 
of which only one opens. We have 
a feeling way down deep, that 
when we come back as alumni, 
well make the horrid mistake of 
pulling on the side of the door that 
is firmly and permanently closed. 
That was last yearnearly eight 
ijvhole months ago.
Imagine my surprise when, on 
arriving back at school after a per 
fectly glorious Christmas vacation, 
I saw a man standing out in front 
of the main door of Maggie Murph, 
playing traffic cop. No, he really 
wasnt directing automobile, bicy
cles, motorcycles, or horses and 
wagons. He was merely telling 
everyone to please use the side 
doors, and was gracefully waving 
his arms toward both doors at the 
same time. Of course, like a very 
obedient Maggie Murph, I entered 
by one of these side doors, but my 
curiosity was aroused (just like a 
woman.) So-o-, I proceeded to in
vestigate.
What do you think I found to be 
the cause of the detour? They 
were putting up another door in
side of the building. about three

Thistle Awards 
Contract; Cover 
Design Unusual
The printing contract for the 
1933 Thistle has been awarded to 
Judd and Detweiler, master print
ers', Washington, D. C., who ac
cording to the Thistle staff, have 
the largest and most modern pub
lishing plant in the South. They 
possess a national reputation for 
producing quality books and maga
zines as well as prize-winning year 
books. One of their best known 
publications is the National Geo
graphic Magazine.
The cover design of this years 
Thistle is to be kept secret until 
the appearance of the book on the 
campus. The entire cover will "be 
a distinct change from those of pre
ceding years. Instead of the usual 
Fabricord material, which is found 
on the majority of year books, the 
cover will be of a new substance 
which has not yet been used for 
annuals.
The remainder of the group pic
tures will be taken this week and 
next week in the Union between 
4:30 and 5:30 each afternoon. For 
appointments, call Regis Joyce, in

Metallurgists Address 
Deals With Future 
of Young Men
Dr. Mehl, director of the Bureau 
of Metallurgical Research at Car
negie, spoke over Station KQV at 
9:00 p. m, last Wednesday. His 
subject, A Future for a Young 
Man, gave a brief outline of the 
history of metallurgy and specified 
requirements for the research me
tallurgist. He elaborated on the 
facilities offered at Carnegie for 
the training of metallurgists.
Research calls for more than a 
knowledge of scientific facts, he 
said. It calls for a quality in the 
research man which might be call
ed research spirit, a combination 
of imagination to help him see new 
things, of initiative to test his 
thinking, of criticism to prevent 
him from fooling himself and 
others, and of great interest to absorb him in his work.
Dr. Mehl published, in the cur
rent Carnegie Magazine, an article 
on the Bureau'of Metallurgical Re
search, explaining the work of this 
bureau. He says that the bureau 
has for its object the prosecution 
of scientific metallurgy, hoping 
that its efforts will contribute 
something to the body to data and. 
theory which constitute metallur
gical science. He advocates the 
forming of an organization which

Womens Glee Club Offers 
Group of College Songs 
For This Program
Today at 11:30 Dean Mary Wat
son Green will speak to the girls 
of Margaret Morrison College in 
the Assembly Hall. The Womens 
Glee Club will furnish the musical 
entertainment with a selection of 
college songs.
Each year at this time Dean 
Green takes the opportunity to ad
dress ' the girls as a group 
to discuss their common 
problems. As her topic for 
today she has chosen College 
LifeWhat Is It? The theme of 
the address will be based on Dean 
Briggs adequate quotations. "At 
college, if you have lived rightly, 
you have found enough learning to 
make you humble, enough friends 
ship -to make your hearts large and 
warm, enough culture to teach you 
the refinement of simplicity, 
enough wisdom to keep you sweet 
in proverty and temperate in 
wealth. With this as her text, 
Miss Green will depict for the girls 
just what their college life should 
embrace. She would like to map 
out for the girls some plan where
by they may enjoy their college 
life and benefit by it to the fullest 
extent.
Friendship, Dean Green feels, is 
one of the most important re
quisites for a successful and happy 
college career. Girls must maice 
contacts, must feel that college is 
more than a place for studies, for 
it is at this time of their-life that 
their minds and personalities are 
developing. Since the girls of 
Margaret Morrison are largely a' 
local group they should also be 
made to comprehend something of 
national and even foreign life. A 
little encouragement given in the 
right way would probably help 
them to make these contacts.
It is well for the girls to stop at 
the close of their first, third, fifth 
or seventh semester of their col
lege curriculum, and consider what 
part of their ambitions they have 
fulfilled. If they pause every so 
often to take stock of the success 
or failure of their ambitions, they 
will be encouraged to continue in 
their pursuit. Yesterday, Dean 
Green introduced Dr. PI. S. I-Iower, 
head of the Department of Physics, 
at a meeting of the Monday Lunch
eon Club. The topic of Ills ad
dress was American Glass.
Meryon Etchings 
To Be Exhibited 
Through Feb. 26
An exhibition of etchings by 
Charles Meryon, one of the great
est of French teachers, according 
to art critics, will continue through 
February 26. There are fifty-one 
etchings on three drawings in the 
exhibition. The exhibition is in the 
Department of Fine Arts.
Mr. Meryon, born in Paris on 
November 23, 1821, was the son of 
Charles Lewis Meryon, an English 
physician and secretary to Lady 
Esther Stanhope, and of Mademoi
selle Pierre Narcisse Chaspoux, a 
lancer of the opera. He spent the 
early years of his life in school at 
Passy, entering the French Naval 
school at Brest in 1838.
Mr. Meryon had little notice or 
public support during his lifetime, 
and, in the face of hunger and dis
couragement, his mind became Af
fected. In 185S he was taken by 
his friends to the asylum at Cliarenton, where he remained for 
fifteen months. At the close of 
the year 1866, it was again neces
sary to confine him at Charenton, 
this time he remained until -his 
death on February 1, 1868.________

Hard Battle 
To Panthers
Carnegie Attack Halted 
By Poor Shooting; 
Plebes Beaten
Doctor Carlsons great aggrega
tion of basketball players from 
across the park put on a fine de
fensive exhibition last Wednesday, 
but from all indications such a 
tight defensive was almost unne
cessary. To urn up the whole situ
ation In very few 111-chose^i word, 
it was just not a Carnegie night. 
Max Hannums collection of deadeye marks men missed their buck
ets equally well from any angle. 
Even Bobble Smith, as sure a shot 
as has played in Pittsburgh in 
many a year, was apparently de:serted by the gods.
The Tartans drove hard at all 
times and on several occasions 
seemed to have the gold and blue 
on the run, but luck and ill-timed 
breaks ruined each opportunity to 
get out in front. The final score 
was 30-24, hut the game was tighter 
than even the score would indi
cate. Frequently missed set-up 
shots were all that saved the 
Panthers in the late stages of the 
game.
Playing without the services of 
Ted Rigg and Red Silverman, the 
Skibos lacked their customary 
finesse, and after Bob Smith had 
countered the opening tally with a 
foul shot, the Pitt boys took a 
slight lead and held onto it 
throughout the game. The score 
at half-time was 16-12 in favor of 
Pitt.
Stent/- was ejected from the 
game early in the second half on 
personal fouls, but Ewalt seemed 
to have almost equal success in outjumping Oclisenhirt, so the big fel
lows absence was not as sorely 
noticed as it might have been. 
While lie was in there, though, the 
Clairton boy put on a whale of a 
battle.
Pitt started strong in the second 
half and piled up a commanding 
lead, but the Tartans returned the 
compliment with a hard rally that 
brought the teams only four points 
apart. The Panthers called time 
out at this time, and they reorgan
ized their forces very effectively. 
The Skibos continued t.o drive 
hard during the remainder of the 
game, but Dr. Carlsons boys man
aged to hold their lead.
Fergus and Jagnow were easily 
the classiest iloormen present, but 
their efforts were largely nullified 
by the poor shooting of the entire 
team. If these lads get clicking In 
the second engagement with those 
Panthers, it looks as if gold jersied 
boys will bo snowed under if the 
Tartans sink half of their shots.
Pitts success offensively seemed 
due to two causos. One was, of 
course, the usual Carlson tactics 
of holding onto the bull as lonir as 
possiblo. The other was tlint they 
were not disinclined to shoot from 
out on the floor when the oppor
tunity presented itself; Old Man 
Percentage told In their favor.
Both tennis prosonted an ironchid two and three /.one defense, 
which made scoring under the 
basket; extremely difficult.
Tn a preliminary to the varsity 
game, the Plobns dropped a fast 
battle to the Pitt freshmen, 39-30. 
Pitt led nt half time, 24-8, but the 
Plobes finished strong.

AT THIS TIME I want to thank the boys on the staff for getting the 
page out last week on such short notlcc. I also want to thank Jim 
Halfcrty for pinch hitting for me in the column. He did such a good 
job of it that it might not be a bad idea to let him continue doing it; 
at least that is what most of the students told me. Anyhow, I found 
that it doesnt pay to play hide and seek with another automobile and 
a blinker light. You always lose out in the end. My sojourn at the 
hospital was not so bad. As a matter of fact, It was rather pleasant. 
The nurses you know are rather nice. If you don't believe me, ask 
Clyde Heinzer.
WE HAVE FREQUENTLY heard about that famed Wash-Jeff Jinx, 
but the longer Im around this Jnstltooshun, the more I think It Is 
overshadowed by the Pitt Jinx. At least the Panther Jinx is more 
effective. Yes sir, for on Wednesday night the Golden Cats from 
across the hill once more walkod away with the basketball .victory. 
This time it was by a 30b24 score. It wouldnt be bad to lose a game 
]ike that to anyone else, but to Pittwell, it is hard to take. The 
first half was a nip and tuck affair until a few minutes before the 
whistlo blew when the Carlsonites ran up a five-point lead. They in
creased this to eight points in the second half, but the Tartans, put 
on a scoring spurt which netted three two pointers and reduced the 
lead to two points, but that about ended the scoring of the Plaids. 
In the second half the Tartans really outplayed their opponents. They 
were more aggressive; they followed the ball better, and had pos
session of it more than the Panthers. Maxie Hannums boys seemed 
weak in only one department, and strangely enough, that one depart
ment seemed to be the basic one of the game. That is, the getting of 
the ball through the hoop. As much of It seemed to be tough luck 
as anything, because the ball seemed as If it would go any place but 
in the bucket. It would roll around, over, and under but never where 
it should have for the two points. Well, you cant win unless you 
throw them in, and that it what the Plaid five found out Wednesday.
FRIDAY NIGHT THE TARTANS meet probably the toughest team in 
the district when they play the Duquesne Dukes in the Plaid gym. The 
Dukes have lost but one game this yeara close one to the Westmins
ter five, but against that they boast of a 26-25 victory over Pitt. And 
the score doesnt indicate just how badly they did take the Panthers 
into camp. Chick Davies, the hilltop mentor, has a veteran com
bination. He has the same team which last year won the city cham
pionship, and in addition to that, ten men who are of varsity caliber. 
But it must be remembered that the Tartans were the only team in the 
district who could bump the Dukes off last year, and there is that 
old saying, what can be done once, can be done again. If Max Hannum can get his cripples from the field house to the gym floor, it will 
be a good ball game.
ON SATURDAY NIGHT the Tartan boxers will knock the lid off the 
fistic campaign when they meet the leather punchers of Duquesne Uni
versity in the Carnegie gymnasium.
Although Ernie Sestos boys will answer the bell for the first time, 
it will be the second engagemnt for Coacli Millers team, and they 
will bo out after their second victory. Last Friday night the Bluflites 
K. O.d the Proxies from W. & J. by a 4-3 score. The Dukes, in Freddy 
Moore, have one of the best and hardest hitting 145 pounders In the 
district. Fred applied the haymaker to his W. & J. opponent in the 
third round. Ho aims to keep his knockout slate intact, but if he 
meets up against Mike Reptalno on Saturday nigljt ho might find the 
going rather difficult.
Pitt scored a 4-3 victory over Temple on Saturday night in Phila
delphia. Tills victory puts them in a tie for first place with Duquesne 
for the load in the Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing Conference. Schriclier 
and Gongloff of Pitt won their bouts by the ten count method. Well, 
it looks as ill the opposition is getting tough.
STUDENTS AND SPECTATORS at the match will attempt to elevate 
the good old lie mans game to the white collar class by appearing 
In formal n-tlre at the bouts. As was the custom last year the choice 
neats will bo snved for those who come In the well-known soup and 
fish. And the co-eds will be sporting their new ovening gowns for the 
first time this year. It should bo good.
Lest ye forgetsuch rude things as applause nnd cheering are bar
red during the course of the fight. Imagine n boxing match without 
those famlllnr phrnses such as: Come on you big bum, or Get up
you pug. Well, times hnve changed.
THE INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL SCHEDULE got under way last 
Monday night and from all indications it looks as if the race for the 
championship is going to bo closer than ever boforo. From now until 
tlio middle of March the gym will put on the uppenrunco <of a threering circus with each of the courts going full blast every night, The 
first upset of I,ho season canio when I,lie Phi Pols defeated Pi Kappa 
Alplm In four ovortlnio periods on Wednesday night, It sure was a 
thriller.

Carnegie Meets Duquesne 
In City Championship Tilt
Tartans Battle Defending Champs in Gym Friday 
Night; Dukes to Present Veteran Team 
Boasting Victory Over Pitt
Max Hannums basketeers are 
guests in their own home Friday 
night when Duquesne is met in the 
Tartan Gym in a game that was 
originally scheduled for the Bluff. 
Chick Davies Dukes are the de
fending City Champions and just 
how to stop this fast, veteran ag
gregation which is already well on 
its way to another title, will be one 
of Der Maxies big worries for the 
next few days.
The impending floor show Is the 
third in the history of the two 
schools. Last year Duquesne 
caught the Skibos in the throes of 
a mid-season slump and walked of! 
with a decisive victory in the first 
meeting between the two teams. 
The return engagement found the 
Tartans in their real stride and the 
Dukes were sent home soundly 
trounced, though still a "champion
ship team.
This year, so much was written 
and expected of Duquesne by the 
local press and fans in the pre-sea
son predictions that the Bluffmen 
started their schedule with a com
plexthat of going through an un
beaten season. The Dukes had 
little trouble defeating Adrian in 
their opener but during that game 
Davies passers reached those lofty 
mental heights that only a defeat 
can overcome. And that defeat 
came soon after, rudely and sud
denly, when the Towering Titans 
of Westminster slipped into town 
and carried away Duquesnes 
hopes for an unbeaten season.
After the Westminster game the 
Dukes came down to earth and 
played real basketball while whip
ping a strong Grove City outfit and 
a mediocre George Washington 
team. Duquesnes greatest victory 
thus far of course, is the one they 
gained against Pitt. That torrid 
battle, which gave them the lead' 
in the City race1 ended 26-25 al
though the Dukes were superior 
throughout and lead by a much 
wider margin at the half.__________
The man who holds the reins of 
the Duquesne bandwagon at pres
ent is one Paul Birch, a sophomore 
from Homestead who won his way 
into the starting lineup and carried 
off the lions share of the scoring 
honors, notably in the Pitt affair. 
Paired with Birch at the forward 
posts is Art Feldman, a veteran 
of the team who hails from Monessen. Captain Bunk McGeever and 
Jim McDougall share the tipoff 
post although , lately McDougall 
has been getting the call. Marty 
Reiter, former Fifth Avenue flash, 
and Dudley Moore, form a pair of 
capable and experienced guards 
who should cause the Plaid offense 
no end of trouble. Irv Brenner, 
the general utility man of the 
Dukes, plays any position equally 
well, although he usually works in 
as a guard.
In the preliminary contest Fri
day, Jimmy Leonard's Plebes, who 
went over big in the second half 
of the Pitt freshmen game, tangle 
with the Duke frosh. As the two 
teams appear to be pretty evenly 
matched, early arrivals will not be 
wanting for entertainment.
Hockey Aspirants 
Start Practice
The hockey aspirants got into ac
tion last Saturday and held their 
first practice in the Duquesne Gar
den. The practice was scheduled 
at the very early hour of six in the 
morning and the whole group 
showed up at that time with the ex
ception of Tom Coulter who came 
later with several interesting ex
cuses.
The fact that tweniy-nve or more 
fellows are sufficiently interested 
in hockey to appear so early In 
the morning speaks well for its 
chances as a regular sport. Dur
ing the practice it became appar
ent that some of the candidates 
have considerable ability and they 
will form the backbone of the new 
sport.___________________________________

Ernie Sesto Selects Team 
To Open Tartan 
Mitt Season
Carnegies first boxing meet of 
the season will be witnessed at 
8:15 next Saturday evening, with 
the Duquesne maulers opposing. 
The team is under the captaincy 
of Henry Carr, who was captain 
last year also. The lineup shown 
below'-wpuld lead one to believe 
that the team is strong enough this 
year, and in the words of Coach 
Sesto, the boys make a scrappy 
bunch. But since this is to be the 
first meet of the season, Mr. Sesto 
remains silent as regards the 
probable outcome.
The Duquesne boxers opened' 
their season last Friday night with 
a 4-3 victory over W. & J., winning 
in the 115-pound, 125-pound, 135- 
pound and the 145-pound bouts. 
The opening meet of the season 
was virtually saved for the Dukes 
by a knockout punch dealt by Fred
die Moore, of the 145-pound class. 
His was the only knockout fur
nished on the Friday night pro
gram, but from all reports the de
vastating right uppercut Mooro 
gave his opponent, Osborne, of W., 
& J., was decisive enough to be 
worthy of note. Osborn was re
vived some ten minutes later.
The Tech-Duke lineup for Satur
day is as follows:

Mitzie Gray and Leah Voegtly 
certainly have an eye for the 
target! For last Friday afternoon 
in the Rifle range they both shot 
a full round of ammunition straight 
through the bulls eye. Mary Wettach followed with an almost per
fect score of 99, and Peggy Schultz 
tied with Eleanor Duffy for a 98. 
This first match of the year was 
shot against Washington Univer
sity, St. Louis, Missouri. Since the 
highest score they have submitted 
is much below that of the Carne
gie squad, the possibility of a vic
tory for our team is almost certain.
While current sports such as 
bowling and basketball have been 
absorbing the attention of feminine 
athletes this little group has 
worked steadily in an attempt to 
perfect their shooting tactics. 
Sergeant Somers expresses high 
hopes for a successful season, for 
he claims they have the best ma
terial in this years team that he 
ihas seen for a long time. W. A. A. 
offers first congratulations of the 
season to the new rifle team, and 
wishes for them the best season in 
their history.
Interest is always felt concern
ing the identity of the Freshman 
high scorer until the first scores of 
the season are announced. Peggy 
Schultz, M. M. plebe, has few rivals 
for the title, for as evidenced ES 
.ridays match she is up there and 
shooting with the best of them. 
Heres hoping for a steady arm in 
the next match, Peggy.
It was unfortunate that the roller 
skating party was scheduled for 
the same night as the Pitt-Tech 
game. Nevertheless, a few skaters 
were on hand and from all reports 
they seemed to have better time 
because of the extra space allowed 
per person. We hope that Mary 
Kelly keeps her promise to have 
another party in the near future.
Jayne Henderson has developed 
a powerful swing in her right arm 
since bowling season opened. The 
score of 111 that she turned irt 
last week makes the rest of the 
title seekers just long to smasb 
enough pins to top that record. 
But they will have to wait until 
next year for Monnie Watters is 
already busy collecting scores 
from the tournament matches, and 
.next week she. will be .ready to an
nounce the winning team.
Although this is gossip for Mr. 
Fence we feel that it is not beyond 
the scope of this column to talk 
about some-sport that was recent
ly inaugurated at Forbes Hall. 
There is a peach of a bannister in 
the front hall, and a trip from the 
second to the first floor is fine for 
trimming off the edges of the 
figure. A certain little swimmer 
who got her Senior Life Saving 
Badge last year must think it is 
time for her to get in practice for 
the swimming season. Shes been 
eating from the mantle for the 
past week! If the cut is flooded 
by rain again this spring we might 
suggest a new method for getting: 
W. A. A.- points. Becky Linn is 
hereby nominated for manager!
LOW-PRICE RENTALS 
TO STUDENTS
Next was the cut. We knew that fine 
tobacco burnt hot because it burnt so 
fast. You could hardly hold your pipe in 
your band, it got so hot at times. So 
remembering how folks used to "whittle 
their tobacco we cut GRANGER just like 
"whittle tobacco"Rough Cut. It 
smokes cooler, lasts longer and never 
gums the pipe.
So far, so good. Now we wanted to 
sell this tobacco for 10c. Good tobacco
 right process  cut right. So we put 
Granger in a sensible soft foil pouch 
instead of an expensive package, knowing 
that a man cant smoke the package.
GRANGER lias not been on sale very 
long, but it has become a popular smoke. 
And we have yet to know of a man who 
started to smoke it, who didnt keep on. 
Folks seem to like it.
Ticket Exchange 
For Duquesne Game
Since the Carnegie-Duquesne 
basketball game this Friday is 
Duquesnes home game it will, 
be necessary for students who 
wish to be there to exchange 
their student tickets at the 
Graduate Managers office, plus 
fifty-five cents, for admission to 
the Carnegie floor. This way 
be done Wednesday, Thursday 
and Friday during regular office 
hours. Positively no exchange 
may be made the night of the 
game.

All races of people since the beginning 
of time, so far as ive have been able 
to read, have had some kind of a pipe 
and have smoked somethingwhether 
they called it tobacco or ivliat not.
A ND since smoking a pipe is so different 
X- from smoking a cigar or cigarette, 
we made a most painstaking, scientific 
study in an effort to make, if we could, 
a tobacco which was suited to pipes.
We found out, first, that there was a 
kind of tobacco that grew in ihe Blue 
Grass section of Kentucky called White 
Burley, and that there was a certain kind 
of lliis tobacco which was between the 
tobacco used for cigarettes and the to
bacco used for chewing tobacco. It is 
this tobacco which is best for pipes.
We found out that Mr. J. N. Wellman, 
many years ago, made a pipe tobacco 
which was very popular. But it was 
never advertised and after be passed 
away nothing more was beard about it. 
We acquired this Wellman Method and 
that is what we use in making Granger.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24. 1033
Yes, I have several liobbies to 
ridewouldnt be natural if I 
didnt, and who doesnt want to be 
natural. The first hobby isno 
. you are wrong. I knew you 
wouldnt guess it. Of course, it is 
the yellow horse which comes in for 
his usual space in these columns. 
Not one, but four horses are con
cerned, and; although I mentioned 
the color as being yellow, I should 
have said white since last year 
their coat was changed to this 
hue. What I am interested in most 
. f all at this time is their care. 
Poor things, I wonder if anybody 
! ever thinks they need a rest, or 
that they get cold standing out in 
all the elements. Then there is the 
question of feeding. Does any
body ever stop to give them an 
occasional apple or two. I think I 
will canvass the situation^ and 
when I have the information I will 
let all in on the secret.
The next hobby isyou thought 
I was going to saybut I wasnt, 
it is the Exam. . question. Now 
there is a hobby and I don't mean 
maybe. This is the week we will 
know what our fate is and where 
we stand in so far as! our value n 
the educational scheme is concern
ed. I dont know what to think 
about the whole question, but I do 
know what I would do if I had any 
say in final grades. There would 
be only one grade given and that 
would beguess I better not men
tion it, because I am quoted ex
tensively.
Speaking of grades brings to my 
mind a recently invented machine 
which is supposed to be the last 
word in marking papers. As I un
derstand the contraption the victim 
is given a list of questions upon 
which he can exercise his choice 
as to answer. A series of numbers 
accompanies the questions and the 
answer thought best is punched at 
the corresponding number. A test 
card is then inserted in the ma
chine and the answers are tabu
lated according to the perforations. 
That's all well and good, but where 
does the human side come in. We 
are not all machines, and if we 
were, who would care to be. classed 
as such. I-Iere we are again faced 
with the technocracy question.
Wonder if I will have to wait un
til those photographers get their 
state permits to operate. I noticed 
that the Thistle staff has been ap
pointed for the night section of the 
Thistle and as this is a photo
graphic venture pure and simple, I 
am concerned on the question be
cause I would not want to have 
my likeness taken by anyone ex
cept a licensed practicioner. You 
know there is lote of fun having 
your picture taken for the Thistle, 
especially when those groups come 
from the arts building. I can hard
ly wait until the notice is printed 
for the time, so when it does, keep 
on the lookout for yours truly.
I noticed in last woelcs Tartan 
that intelligence is not enough to 
make one successful. There are 
other things equally as important. 
Originality seems to be in the front 
ranks when it comes to success. I 
am glad to know this because if 
there is anything I like better than 
being original it is being more 
original. One doesnt have to look 
very far 'to note the successful ef
forts of our original night students. 
No, I am not thinking of the first 
night students who attended Car
negie, but rather those night stu
dents who have been original in 
their thoughts and efforts; those 
who have worked steadily to put 
over the successful affairs and 
have put our night school in the 
first rank with the other leading 
night schools of the country.
Well, boys, cheer up, the worst 
is yet to come,, and if you don't be
lieve me, observe the faces of all 
those night students you see leav
ing classes all thi week. You 
could write a book based on the 
glances cast. Ah me! its a tough 
world anyway. Here I am, limited 
in space again. The editor told 
me that there wasn't much space 
for me this issue, so I guess I bet
ter sign off. That was the Idle 
Night Student signing off until this 
time next week. The Tartan bids 
you all night.

Dr. Baker Believes America 
To Be Cradle of New Culture
In Address Delivered Before Haus der Presse, 
Berlin, He Declared That American Mind Is 
Too Much Dominated by Feminine Element
can continue only so long as it 
gives the public what it^wants, and 
it is successful today because it 
provides something that holds the 
, attention of all types of minds. 
We are a nation docile in the 
realm of ideas and bound to con
ventionalism, said Dr. Baker. In 
affairs of a practical nature, the 
American mind is independent, 
intrepid, ingenious and even highly 
imaginative. In dealing with ques
tions that are not practical, it is 
bound by conventions. The Amer
ican will plan a skyscraper, or the 
development of an industrial plant, 
or a financial coup with great orig
inality and daring, but, concerning 
the fundamental issues of politics, 
religion, moralsanything of a 
philosophical nature, he is apt to 
be orthodox to the point of docility 
and we are therefore a race of con
servatives. We are not protestants.' We get little satisfaction 
from protesting if the case is hope
less or impractical. The youngest 
of the great is a traditionalist par 
excellence.
This characterization hardy 
rhymes with the popular concep
tion of the American. He is sup
posed to be pushing, restless, 
progressive, venturesome. All 
these adjectives may be applied to 
him truthfully. It is only in the 
realm of ideas that he seems to 
lose his courage and become docile, 
hesitant. Why? Primarily be
cause the American is a man of 
action.
Dr. Thomas S. Baker, president 
of Carnegie, in his speech entitled 
"The American Mind which he 
delivered before a distinguished 
audience at the Haus der Presse 
in Berlin declared that the Amer
icans are a race of conservatives.
Europe, said Dr. Baker on 
opening, attempts to understand 
the American mind and is of two 
opinions. To one onlooker, little 
is revealed except crass material
ism, selfishness, a heedless chase 
after unworthy goals. Other ob
servers see a new spirit, an ardor, 
a freshness, a confidence, a youth
fulness which is accompanied by 
an abounding faith in humanity 
and in the value of human effort. 
We produce, we create, we enrich 
the world by developing the crude 
forces of nature, by turning raw 
materials into things that are use
ful. In making a cult of produc
tivity, we are apostles of a new 
order.
In speaking of the vigor and 
physical energy of the American 
people which leads to the yearning 
for success and the striving after 
big things, Dr. Baker said, In gen
eralizing about the American mind 
and character, it is just as unsafe 
to make the sweeping charge of a 
nation of materialists as to read 
into our actions a high degree of 
spirituality. Our most precious 
possession is our vitality and our 
capacity for enthusiasm for what
ever we undertake. Our intellec
tual and even our spiritual life 
may some day be enriched by the 
qualities that have marked the 
other phases of our living.
The American lives often with
out a fixed objective, but he feels 
lie must move forward; his goal 
may be uncertain but he must nev
er stop, whether times are good or 
bad, he must keep on, he must be 
aggressive, he must forge ahead.
Closely linked with the Ameri
can idea of progress, Dr. Baker 
said in referring to the physical 
conquest or nature, is the Amer
ican idea of personal success. 
Since human progress is achieved 
by increasing industrial production 
and the general accumulation or 
upbuilding of wealth, individual 
progress is achieved by helping to 
increase the production and by the 
acquisition of wealth. Personal 
success is a matter of objective ac
complishments.
It is the Americans ambition 
not to be, but to do. He is more 
concerned with enhancing the 
property values than the personal 
values. His efforts are devoted to 
improving his circumstances rather 
than himself. With a continent to 
clear and the worlds largest indus
trial organization to build, he has 
not had the leisure to adjust his 
mind to philosophical attitudes.
The man in the street has come 
to cherish the belief that success 
is possible to the individual if he 
can only find the key that will un
lock the door that opens out on a 
prosperous career. If he lacks the 
originality and the ideas that lead 
to prosperity, he atempts, one 
might say, by main force, to com
pel wealth by analyzing, codifying, 
systematizing the ideas of others., 
He is a seeker after a formula of 
success.
American Lives for Present
The American wants results but 
his chief happiness consists in get
ting them and not in enjoying 
them. He lives for the present 
not for the future', President 
Baker declared: He insures his
life for the protection of his wife 
and family after his death and is 
rarely moved to provide for him
self an annuity that will give him 
an old age untroubled by work or 
worry.
In a mechanical age, the Amer
ican has pushed the mechanization 
of existence to the most advanced 
point. But he is never content. 
He makes his engines bigger; he 
increases his supply of power; he 
hopes for an existence untroubled 
by hard labor.
"America will be the first coun
try that will be called upon to 
solve the question of the machine. 
She has done most to create it; 
she is more completely dominated 
by it than any other nation. She 
will be required to decide whether 
the domination shall be beneficent 
or perniciouswhether the increas
ing freedom from burdensome phy
sical tasks will create a new and 
higher culture or whether the de
pendence upon mechanical contri
vances will weaken the vitality of 
the race and destroy its creative 
power.
We Are Nation of Conservatives
Dr. Baker mentioned the stand
ardization which is so prevalent 
even in our methods of thinking. 
Our methods of living, our opin
ions, our amusements, are being 
prescribed by a comparatively 
small number of persons, who are 
in a sense our mental dictator/

Lois inscribed thereon. Will finder

room, as this instrument is valued 
a keep-sake.'
What America has so far ac
complished has been due to its be
lief in the idea of progress which 
is measured by physical achieve
ments."
Lauds American Generosity
President Baker praised, us for 
our generosity and told of one of 
our financial geniuses who twentythree years ago gave up one of the 
highest positions of profit to de
vote the whole of his energy to
ward making America a better 
place for his children and grand
children to work in and to live in.
Certainly no land gives of its 
riches more liberally to religion, to 
education, to alleviate human suf
fering, even to art, than America. 
Along with its extravagance there 
is also a national strain of gener
osity. The American may not be 
liberal in small things, but as a 
rule he feels a certain responsi
bility to his neighbor, ^ sense of 
dependence upon those who sur
round him.''
Woman's Influence Too Great
As we discuss the American 
mind, declared Dr. Baker, we 
must, observe the large influence 
that is exerted by women. The 
political influence of women is dis
appointing. Since they have re
ceived the sufferage we can per
ceive no marked change, certainly 
no marked improvement, in our 
methods of administering govern
mental affairs.
I must not overlook the femi
nine element in American educa
tion . . . Nearly every child in 
the United States^ male and female, 
is taught by women exclusively up 
to its twelfth year and many be
yond that age. Foreign observers 
. . . because primary education is 
in the hands of women . . . be
lieve that some of the restlessness 
in our manner of thinking is ex
plained. /
AmericanCaptain of His Soul
It is possible, Dr. Baker re
marked, further analyzing the 
American mind, that some of the 
rush and bustle of American life 
is due to a certain subconscious 
dissatisfaction. We are not com
pletely at peace with ourselves and 
in our search for self-satisfaction 
we drive- ourselves in many direc
tions in the hope that we may in 
the end find the right road. If we 
were asked to define or describe 
our philosophy of life ... we 
would doubtless discover that the 
keynote of the Americans attitude 
of mind is that he is the master of 
his own fate, the captain of his 
soul.
We hight say that the American 
is ever striving to acquire greater 
individual powerpower over the 
forces of nature, power over the 
circumstances with which -human 
beings are surrounded, power to 
control his destiny. He finds it 
difficult .to theorize about his striv
ings, but unconsciously he is dim
ly aware of a disharmony with 
some of the traditional expressions 
of religion, art and philosophy. It 
is in his search for a harmony be
tween the hard realities of an in
dustrial civilization and the world 
of the spirit and the imagination 
America will some day find a way 
to express its emotions and aspira
tions.
AmericaCradle of New Culture
America may well be the cradle 
of a new culture. Our joy in liv
ing consists largely in the spend
ing of strength and when this su
perabundant happiness in accom
plishment can be employed on ob
jectives that are higher than the 
creation of things, we may hope 
for a greater flowering of the in
tellectual life.
President Baker said in conclud
ing his address, If America is to 
have a form of culture as imposing, 
as significant as her material ac
complishments, it cannot be 
achieved by laboratory methods or 
compelled by exterior force. It 
will come as the natural, instinc
tive expression of the mood of the 
people . . . Americans riches can 
only aid in its intellectual progress 
insofar as they liberate human be
ings from material cares and give 
them larger opportunities for sprltual enrichment.
The intellectual greatness to 
which America aspires will be 
achieved more quickly as we over
come the present ideal that to do 
is more important than to be.
Night Arts Will 
Hold Dance Soon 
In Thistle Hall
Just what you have been waiting 
for, twenty words, many more, no 
less. A dance by the Night Col
lege of Fine Arts is to be held in 
Thistle Hall soon. To merely say 
that they are holding a dance is 
little indeed, but to say that it will 
be in Thistle Hall is something 
else. Of course, dear boys and 
girls, this is of interest only to 
night art students, for this is their 
dance and the possibilities of any
one else attending is very remote, 
to say the least.
In case you have been wonder
ing about the date, and have for
gotten that your little green hand
book contains the information, we 
hasten to remind you that it is Sat
urday, February 4. There, now you 
know the time and the place which 
is most important, except for the 
name of the orchestra to whose 
music you will dance. That is 
something we can!t tell you yet for 
we dont know outselves. You can 
rest assured however, that it will 
be a good one.
The social committee is busily 
engaged in making plans for the 
affair, and promises everybody a 
good time.
As in the past, all regularly reg
istered night students in the Col
lege of Fine Arts are entitled to 
attend. Admittance will be gained 
by a night arts registration card 
or by tickets which will be distrib
uted by the night arts officers.
Phi Nu Fraternity To 
Hold Initation Jan. 28
Phi Nu, night social fraternity, 
will hold an initiation and business 
meeting in the Dutch room of the 
Fort Pitt Hotel 011 Saturday, Janu
ary 28. A number of pledges are 
to be welcomed into the organiza
tion and the social committee 
promises an interesting program 
which includes music by The 
Orchestra and a talk by Karl B. 
Weber, who is a graduate of the 
night course in architecture, will 
describe his experiences on a 
Windjammer. Members will 
need no urging to avail themselves 
of this opportunity to aid in wel
coming the pledges, and to enjoy 
the program which has been pre
pared for them.-
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT a good many night 
owls in the industries and en
gineering school are breathing 
kind of hard these days. No, 
not because they have been 
running for elusive street cars. 
They got that way trying to 
solve some of those easy exams 
the profs insist on giving.
THAT certain other students 
are breathing hard only because 
of the uncertainty of what this 
Saturday P. M. holds for them.
THAT tho unexpected rain 
the other night spoiled the fun 
of a certain group as they sent 
some innocent pledges through 
their paces, and were the 
pledges thankful? But we are 
rather fearful of the conse
quences of this enforced delay.
That our comment about 
those two dagger slinging art 
students caused quite a furor. 
Hey Winchel, look to your lau
rels.
THAT our comment about 
about the party on Nut crack
er hill. We were not there, 
but did we get the dirt on some 
certain individuals? Heh, heh, 
dunt esk, especially those sway
ing, folded arm singers.
THAT some of our better 
known night citizens were seen 
headed for Thistlo Hall one 
evening last week. Kinda step
ping out, eh boys?
THAT the night arts are 
again participating in the Arts 
Ball this year, and am 1 green 
with envy? Would that I 
were an art student just for a 
night.
THAT the Art school night 
students are having another of 
those intimate dances next 
week. Maybe I could be an arts 
student for a couple of nights, 
but Ill crash this dance if it 
kills me.
That those clever signs ad
vertising the last Council dance 
were pilfered soon after their 
appearance on the bulletin 
boards.
THAT thats that and ill bo 
seenya.
Prompt Return of 
Tickets Is Urged
Ail night students having tickets 
for the Post-Holiday dance are re
quested to make full returns to 
John F. Simpson, Treasurer, Night 
Student Council, Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. No postage will bo 
necessary if the returns aro 
dropped in the inter-school mail 
slot of the post office in the base
ment of the Industries building.
Japanese Tactics 
In China Scored
The Chinese have at last banded 
together in an effort to. repel the 
newest Japanese invasion. In a 
previous article, the writer stated 
that possibility of unification in the 
face of danger was great. The 
prediction has come true, and Jehol 
province is being flooded with 
Chinese troops, determined to repel 
the Nipponese at any cost.
Japan has ignored the far-famed, 
but ineffectual, League of Nations 
rebuke, and has warned the Chi
nese to cease invading Chinese 
territory, or take the consequences. 
With little aid or justice to expect 
from outside sources, China has 
prepared to take the consequences 
of fighting for what is theirs. 
Although they are less wellequipped than their enemies, the 
Chinese have' determination on 
their side, and that lias often de
cided the outcome of many one
sided struggles.
The coming war, official or unde
clared, will be interesting to fol
low, both from the viewpoint-of the 
militarist and the strategist, as 
well as from the humanistic side.

Silence of Night 
School Students 
Puzzle Observer
Somo people seek thrills by rid
ing tendem bicycles, others climb 
old man Bigelows statuo to give 
vent to their emotions. But leave 
it to the fair P. and D. students in 
day school to discover a new 
brand of thrills.
When a day has been uneventful 
and uninteresting, and the fair P. 
and D. is feeling like the prover
bial last rose of summer, what does 
she do for excitement but pick up 
her drawing board aud charcoal 
then proceed to get the thrill of 
her life by pretending to be a night 
student.
But alas, she does not last long. 
Before an hour or so lias elapsed 
she throws up her hands in utter 
dispair, amf complains to tho in
structor that the prevailing silence 
is terrifying and unbearable, that 
shell soon bo getting a nervous 
breakdown, aud she cannot con
tinue. She then borrows a cigar
ette and smokes away the rest of 
the evening.
Perhaps night art students feel 
that silence is golden in the sense 
that it is fertile atmosphere for tlie 
development of genius; or that in
spirations are more readily appre
hended under such conditions. Per
haps theirs is a problem the sig
nificance of which only the analy
tical mind of a psychologist can 
fully camprehend.

This very old illusion was invented by Indian 
fakirs. The secret was unearthed in 18+9 by the 
great magician, Robert-Houdin. At that time, ether 
had just been discovered, and little was known 
about it. Houdin claimed that he had discovered 
that this new anesthetic could make people light as 
air. Tb prove it, he caused the subject to rise into 
the air and float apparently suspended. He passed 
a hoop around the body to show there were no 
wires or supports.
EXPLANATION:
There are many, many explanations for this old 
trick. One is that the girl wears a concealed harness, 
which ends in a socket between her shoulder blades. 
This is attached to a piston below the stage. The 
piston is pushed up from below, causing her to 
rise in the air. The piston is invisible, because it 
is covered with mirrors which reflect surrounding 
draperies, similar to the background. The magi
cian can pass the hoop over her body because it 
is cut in one place. It can be pulled apart for a 
second when it passes the piston.

Its fun to be fooled__
...its more fun to KNOW
Another magic show is cigarette adver
tising.
One of its greatest tricks is the illusion 
that cigarettes can be made miraculously 
"MILD" through manufacturing methods.
hNe eVulthLTtr All popular cigarettes 
today are made in modern sanitary factories 
with up-to-date machinery. All are heat 
treated some more intensively than others, 
because raw, inferior tobaccos require
more intensive treatment than choice, ripe 
tobaccos.
The real difference comes in the tobaccos 
that are used. The better the tobacco, the 
milder it is.
It is a fact, well known by 
leaf tobacco experts, that 
Camels are made from finer, MORE 
EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other 
popular brand. \
This is why Camels are so mild. This is why 
Camels have given more pleasure to more 
people than any other cigarette ever made.
Its the secret of Camels rich bouquet 
...their cool flavor...their non-irritating 
mildness.
All the natural, ripe goodness of Camels 
tobacco is kept fresh for you by the famous 
air-tight, welded Humidor Pack. Dont 
remove it.

More About Collegiate Golf
The importance oJ: golf as a tool in the chest of the college 
graduate is again emphasized in a recent editorial in The Chris
tian Science Monitor which tells about the inclusion of a course 
in the history and technique of golf in the curriculum of a col
lege. This type of course is most unusual and marks a further 
step in what is called learning to live while at college.
According to the editorial, a competent instructor super
vises the field work and gives suggestions 100 the proper 
stance and stroke, how best to tee oft and follow through, 
and what golf clubs to use to meet every emergency in the 
game.
The editorial goes on:
At first glance it might appear that the addition of golf 
proficiency to the equipment of a college-trained man possesses 
little educational value, but when one considers the larger 
measure of leisure now available to everyone, likewise the 
growing importance of planned recreation as an adjunct to 
daily living, the experiment, perhaps, takes on new significance. 
An education based solely, on acquisition of facts and 100 voca
tional dexterity is apt to be cramped and lopsided.
An ability to give oneself at certain times unreservedly 
to play is probably quite as desirable these days as the eager
ness for productive workand as rewarding.
The cultivation of enjoyable hobbies, the art of knowing 
how to travel intelligently 100 a thin wallet, the strengthening 
of musical and literary tastes, constitute the inner citaMel of a

doplay cards and golf. These two forms of recreation can do

An Examination Of Technocracy
All of the current bubble about technocracy is to bo put into 
a huge pot, a ton oh ol! investigation added, and the real nugget 
prooipitatod, il! Tho Nation, weekly current event magazine, has 
its way. This dynamic publication lias undertaken an audit of 
technocracy and has appointed a committoo oJ! ongineers, po
litical scientists, economists, and staijisticians to gather broth 
for the pot. Already the people have tired of hearing about 
the theory of the technocrats, which is by no means new, and 
such an investigation, ill it would reveal all the facts and pro
sent them so that they could be understood, would be welcomed. 
Heaven forbid more vagueness and demogogic rambling 1 Let's 
get the facts, read them impartially, and place them 100 the

THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
Little Cliiaa man 
Siltin' on liis wall,
'long came old Japan
And made him happynot at all.
The Japanese are at it again in 
the Orient. In reply to League o 
Nation's demand that they accept 
the reconciliatory measures offer
ed by this country and the League, 
the Japanese*emissaries answered 
that they would consider them as 
soon as the state o Manchukuo 
was recognized. By doing this 
Japan has turned an ultimatum in
to a lever by which they will at
tempt to force the League to ac
cept the new state over which they 
have virtual control. This land 
was practically wrested from the 
Chinese and the protectorate set 
up.
A short time ago Japan made 
similar inroads into Shanhailcwan 
and captured it. They have been 
noilhor caroful nor diplomatic in 
their relationship with foreigners 
in the disputed territory. Ah Amer
ican plant was blown up by Japan
ese and several pooplo wore in
jured and killed in the explosion. 
Dosp'to tho numerous protests of 
neutral nations, Japan has not 
soomod to lighten her attack and 
slow but suro is occuputing north
ern China.
Should Japan withdraw from tho 
League of Nations sho would bo 
free to follow any plan of arma
ments sho should sou lit. Tho 
League now has tho chance to 
show exactly what it can do. If it 
is unable to cope with the SinoJapaneso misunderstandings (one 
must call them misunderstandings 
because no state of war has been 
declared) other nations will lose 
their faith in the League and cause 
it to be marked down as another 
noble experiment gone wrong. 
However, should they succeed in 
straightening out the problem the 
League will be respected and its 
decisions looked up to and obeyed 
in the future.
Hoover the budget tried to balance, 
But Congress wouldnt let him 
do it.
Though Herb argued only for a
chance,
The Democrats want Roosevelt
to do it.
Herbert Hoover wanted to at
tempt to Balance the Budget a 
short time ago. The Democratic 
leaders in Congress would not give 
him the chance: They intimated
that they had a plan to save the 
taxpayers considerable money. 
Now that they have deprived 
Hoover of his chance to try and 
organize this mythical budget, the 
Democrats are plenty worried 
about delivering the plan which 
they promised.
After a meeting with President
elect Roosevelt, the committee is
sued a statement implying that the 
income tax would be raised. This 
was not received very well by the 
people of the nation, since It nas 
been difficult to collect the full 
value of income taxos in the past 
because tho influential men of the 
country receive tremendous exemp
tions, thereby, so the middle-class 
man says, making the little follow 
carry tho burdon. Tho Domocrats 
unconsciously save Hoover a lot of 
ombnrrassmont and placed thornsolves in in uneasy position.
Hoover invited Itoosovelt
To tho White House for somo toa.
Blit Frank refused to come.
"No war-dobts," said ho, for mo."
Tho French nation is overjoyed 
as a whole at Roosevelts refusal to 
have anything to do with Hoover's 
manipulations for the payment or 
the war-debts. Roosevelts contin
ued refusal has given the French 
a chance to carry out their mean
ingless Watch and See" plan. It 
is inevitable that tho Democrats 
will have to develop somo kind of 
a new plan for the payment of the 
debts since England and other na
tions which have made their pay
ments intimated that this last pay
ment would be the last they would 
make under the present plan.

POOR JOHN
John E. Soyring, Kingfish of Scobell Castle, 
heat engineer, member of Pop Trinks "Four Ss" 
(Smith, Scbwelger, Spangler, Soyring) and for 
lo! these many moons, a very regular visitor to 
the West Penn Hospital Nurses Home, is cur
rently heart broken.
It seems that the visitee at the nurses home 
has been called to New York for three months, 
and Soyring, with the light of his life dimmed by 
distance (intensity varies inversly as the square 
of the dis
tance) has 
been finding 
life very, very 
hard.
Ills loyal 
friends, the 
S c o b elllans, 
s y mpathizing 
deeply with 
John during
his period of sorrow and suffering, composed 
some jolly little verses which they sing boister
ously in an effort to bolster his flagging interest 
in life and enable him to weather the storm and 
stress of these trying times.
One of these verses, sung to the tune of that 
rollicking ballad, Sailing, Sailing Over the 
Bounding Main," is:
Soyring, Soyring,
All that he does is gripe 
And itll be a good three months 
Before the time is ripe.
The singing of these verses, of which there are 
now more than a dozen, has proved very helpful 
to John. He 110 longer dares to worry In public! 
If he does, the suggestion Is immediately made 
that we cheer him up with a song, and if you 
have every heard a dormitory shower-room tenor, 
you would readily understand why John does not 
relish the cheering up process. John has reached 
the point where a life which is just one long ser
enade, with Wiberg singing soprano, is not 
worth living, and so he has given up mooning, at 
least in public.
*****
ABOUT CAMPUS
The same bunch mentioned in the preceding 
paragraph pulled a fast one the other night when 
Mr. Soyring got a cake from home. They took 
said cake down to the grill and used Mr. Orbins, 
best silverware and china to put on a feed. They 
even asked for water.
Jimmy Stahls latest accomplishment is popular 
song writing. At present hes working on one 
that promises to make a hit, called "Close In 
My Arms. Weve heard part of It and wonder 
why Jimmie has been hiding all his latent ability.
Forbes Halls inseparable Pegs, Misses Morin 
and Weidlein, spent a very pleasant Tuesday aft
ernoon last week having tea with Doc Marks. 
Imagine Miss Joyces surprise when they came 
walking down the hall with a pot of tea and some 
cups. Tis rumored that there was a formal in 
said hall last Friday. How should we know?

nomics, wagers that if technocracy comes into

THE JOURNALISTS
The first journalists ball found several jour
nalists and several non-journalists tripping the 
light fantastic to the tunes of Daum-Saundersons 
orchestra. It nearly turned out to be a Pi D. E.- 
Pi K. A. joint convention. Mr. and Mrs. Lawler 
were on hand seeing what the situation was 
with the local campus couples, as Mr. Lawler 
put it. They saw Tartan Editor John Ladd with 
Tip Varner, ex-Tartan Editor Jack Boyle with 
Norva Heater, Puppet Editor Bill Lazarus stag, 
and Thistle Editor Ed Rhodes with an attractive 
Theta from Pitt. The Puppets Mr. Stankey with 
Marg Griffin and The Butterick Company's Mr. 
Chervenak with Betty Mackey (by the way this 
couple claims the distinction of having attended 
more Thistle Hall dances this year than any of 
its competitors). Among competitors present 
Friday were Jean DuBerry and Harry Krider. 
Puppet Ad Manager John Fox, plus his secretary, 
Mary Wettach, and Exchange Editor Rog MiddleKauff also helped things along a bit.

PRE-ARTS BALL
The Arts Ball had its first get-acquainted party 
last Wednesday in the mud room. Music was 
furnished by an eleven-piece orchestra and Vir
ginia reeling was led by Mr. Ellis.
A big bar set up in the end farthest from the 
door and refreshments flowed freely. Some Sculp
tor or Sculptress must have been to good old 
Greenlch Vil
lages Barn' 
judging from 
the placards 
that were 
draped about 
the various 
casts. The 
first day was 
very much a 
success with
the date bureau relieved of several customers. 
Mary Lou Mehler finally got up enough courage 
to ask him that afternoon while Julian von der 
Lanlcen and Betty Farrell got tilings fixed up. 
Plenty of engineers -were on hand also trying to 
get dates. Wont they be surprised?
LITTLE THEATER REVIEW
Seldom is there presented a play 
which is exactly adapted to the 
rare abilities of Carnegies Depart
ment of Drama. The recent pro
duction of The Virgin Goddess" 
in the Little Theater proved to be 
one of these unusual combinations. 
Generously given the use of the 
play by its author, Mr. Rudolph 
Besier, the Department of Drama 
enthusiastically anu sympathetical
ly set'about preparing what was to 
bo the Initial presentation of this 
English author's particular play In 
America.
The swiftly paced story of this 
drama sweeps unfalteringly to its 
tragic close. Cast in classical 
form and observing the unities, Mr. 
Besier's play does, however, intro
duce some variations which serve 
to modernize its form. The suc
cess and power of this combination 
was reflected in the absorbed at
tention tho audience accorded to 
its presentation.
His warriors lost at sea, Crosphontes, King of Artis, weakly 
turns to prayer rather than defend 
liis city against the leagued forces 
of tho revolting cities vassal to his 
own. Contemptuous of such weak
ness, Althea, the Queen, secretly 
sends for tho King's brother, 
Ilophaestion, who, though gfreatly 
honored by the people of Artis, has 
been exiled by Cresphontes be
cause of the King's jealousy. 
Althea and I-Iephaestion, masking 
their human love in the guise of 
patriot love, plot to kill the King. 
Artemis, the Virgin Goddess, to 
whom I-Iephaestion had dedicated 
himself, decreed that to save Artis 
Hepliaestion would have to kill the 
woman he loved, Althea, with the 
same sword he had used to kill 
the King. Forced to obey the de
cree by the Queens devotion to 
her people, Hepliaestion slays 
Althea and the avenged goddess 
saves the city through the miracu
lous return of the lost ships.
In The Virgin Goddess, Mr. 
Besier has written a drama i:i 
verse which deserves more con
sideration than it lias received. 
The limited appeal its production 
had when offered in the Adelplii 
Theater in London back in 190G 
might indicate that The Virgin 
Goddess" cannot be successfully 
run in the commercial theater; but 
the approval and interest elicited 
by this same play when produced 
by the Department of Drama sug
gests the probability that Mr. 
Besiers drama would be favorably 
received by the Little Theater 
audiences that have been develop
ing throughout the country.

tipn was novel in that the sky, the 
pediment of the temple, and the 
capitals of the temple pillars were 
painted upon a drop whose lower 
edge hung quite some distance 
above the stage floor. Four pillars 
connected the lower edge of the 
drop to the top of the temple steps, 
the steps descending in widening 
single-step degrees to the stage 
floor where they spanned the en
tire proscenium opening. Wings 
erected on both sides of the stage 
were so designed and painted as to 
blend into the trees painted upon 
the temple drop. Under the ably 
executed lighting and aided by the 
extremely high curtain line, the 
ilusion of a temple standing out 
from the sky and surrounding trees 
was nearly perfect. The temple 
was historically accurate, too, In 
that it was in colors rather than, 
as commonly conceived, in white.
The performance itself, using 
past productions of the department 
as a standard, was not so carefully 
done. When the larger difficulties 
of working within a definite pro
duction schedule with a group <not 
intensively trained in the presen
tation of drama in verse are con
sidered, however, it Is easy to ex
cuse noticeably varying pronunci
ations and an occasional awkward 
bit of stage business. Perhaps the 
very nature of'the play served to 
draw attention to little details that 
would ordinarily go unobserved. 
Descriptive-' passages, beautiful in 
themselves, were hurried unduly; 
possibly this Was done rather than 
risk losing attention.
Fern Ball and Marcia Leety as 
the Queen and the blind mother of 
the King, shared the honors in re
spect to the best individual per
formances. Emanuel Breakstone 
handled the difficult part of the un
fortunate King, Cresphontes, with 
a certain steady sureness that gave 
his performance a finish. William 
Roos, on the contrary, carried him
self too tensely and in the emo
tional scenes over-acted to such an 
extent that he was no longer con
vincing. His trick of rolling his 
Rs added to this artificiality. 
Harry Schofield lost distinctness by 
his nervously rapid speech. A 
large cast of minor characters 
added color and impressiveness, 
aided especially in this respect by 
the exceptionally fine costuming 
characteristic of the entire produc
tion.

feet in from the afore-said door. 
A storm door, at that! Now. tell 
me. Who ever heard of a storm 
door on the inside of a building?
The door is prettyreally very 
pretty. It is painted and varnished 
in the most expert manner, and 
shines "like everything. You cau 
almost see to powder your nose in 
it, girls. There are two doors 
double doors, on of which is per
manently closed to correspond with 
the original once. There are also, 
two side pieces, forming a little 
vestigule in which three people 
can almost turn around. . Both the 
'doors and side pieces have nice, 
big pieces of glass in them so that 
you can see everything that is go
ing on.
The first, day or two the movable 
doors had the cutest little wooden 
knob for a handle; and, if you were 
good, you could get the door open 
by pulling hard enough on tills 
knock. Then, all of a sudden, a 
flashy brass handle and plate ap
peared In place of the knob. One 
little jerk, and the door Is open!
Who cares what the door loos 
like, anyway? Its the object of 
the thing that worries me. Is it a 
storm door? If it is, why doesnt It 
storm some time soon so we can 
get the full benefit of the door.
What will the alumni say now 
when they come back for a visit?
REMEMBER WHEN?
Maggie Murph in the good old days when all, the co-eds wore 
bustles and hoop skirts and rode to school in gas buggies. Maggie 
Murph, one of the early units of Carnegie, was built in 1907. The 
wings were completed a year later. The Fine Arts building was 
well, just where was it? The dirt road is an early edition of Woodlawn avenue. Imagine the traffic congestion during the -noon hour.

The current issue of the Puppet

bound in red leather and cloth and

The trade edition is printed in 
the same type on egg-shell finish 
paper, bound in boards, fall cloth, 
and stamped in gold on the back
bone. Most of the text was hand
set by Mr. Phelps.
It is hoped by this work to es
tablish the Voyageur Press as the 
publication medium for the many 
Minnesota and northwest histori
cal treasurers that now lie buried 
in the archives of state societies.
The second part of this book is 
as interesting as the first. It con
tains a collection of letters written 
between 1834 and 1844 by Sibley 
to Ramsay Crooks, who succeeded 
Astor as head of the American Fur 
Company. With Mr. Blegens able 
introduction and notes, they bring 
Sibleys character and personality 
into high relief. Here is a man, 
who on the edge of the wilderness 
surrounded by uncouth, uneducat
ed men, burdened by affairs, has 
time and interest enough to ask 
his employer to send him Pres
cotts Conquest of Mexica. Hallams Middle Ages, and Thiers 
French Revolution. The books 
bespeak the man.
The autobiography covers some 
thirty-two pages in type; the let
ters about twenty-eight pages. Ad
mittedly, it is incomplete and frag
mentary and of far more interest 
to the scholar and collector than 
to the general reader. But there 
are lights and shadows here. The 
spirit of high adventure lurks in 
these pages. Perhaps a wider au
dience than the publisher antici
pates may be found for Governor 
Sibley as an author. It is to be 
hoped the work will succeed, if 
only as a foundation stone for 
further letters, memoirs and 
diaries now unknown outside a 
small and professional circle of re
searchers and historians. This ar
tistic work is earning Mr. Phelps 
an enviable place in the realm of 
printing.

EDGEWORTH SMOKING TOBACCO
English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
The charge of having literary 
ghosts to write their speeches and 
to prepare their official .pronounce
ments has often been made against 
politicians. How substantial the 
foundation for this accusation is 
we cannot say. When, therefore, 
Governor John G. Polland, a poli
tician, wrote a book and gave him
self a new title, -we could only give 
credit on the basis of what the 
title page contained.
The governors text is a new dic
tionary of word meanings that are 
the product of our contemporary 
life. Using the principle that 
every important word has to carry 
around, in addition to its diction
ary definition, the meaning that 
each one of us has attached to it 
as a result of his life's experi
ences, he has compiled a list that 
is in its own way not only difinttive but also critical. Some of the 
more interesting examples defined 
are:
Alimonya fine levied on a man 
guilty of matrimony. (An older 
and better definition is taxation 
without representation.)
Bankinglending out other peo
ples money and keeping the inter
est for yourself.
Criticisma thing that may be 
avoided by saying nothing, doing 
nothing, and being nothing.
Diplomat a man who remembers 
a womans birthday and forgets her 
age.
Depressiona period of time in 
which we have to do without whatrour parents never had.
Gentlemanone who can dis
agree without being disagreeable. 
(This term was defined better by 
the very careful Newman as One 
who never inflicts pain.)
Prohibitiona thing that will 
never be successful until it has 
been tried. (This reminds one of 
the phrase, A noble experiment.)
The governor forestalls his own 
critics by giving himself a newly 
coined and newly defined title. 
As a pseudo lexicographer lie be
comes a connotator, the editor 
of a connotory, which he defines
