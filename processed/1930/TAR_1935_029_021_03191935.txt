In previous years PI Delta Epsilon has conducted on annual contest among the papers of the Pittsburgh junior and senior high schools.

The largest of tbe models is that ol the Tygert river dam. The Tygert river reservoir will cost $15,- 000,000, and will provide flood protection for Pittsburgh, and improve dry weather'navigation on the Mo- nongahela' river. It will be the largest coucreto dam east of th Mississippi river, its total height balng^SO feet. . It. is to ..be. pierced by ten-'large outlet conduits. At the top of the.dam.is a spillway to pass severe floods.

THE CARNEGIE POOL WILL CONTINUE TO BE KEPT on the map

rial competing for important honors.- And tfie week following, on the 
same day. will find the pool entertaining the W. P. I. L. meet. But the 
real big one will he the Y. M. C. A. National Championships, April 26 
and 27, with unlimited talent and a lot of excitement.
Tbe Eastern Collegiate Swimming Association, meet, which was 
held in the Carneglo pool two weeks ago, will be held either at LaFoyelte or Manhattan next year.
DOBMJTE BAUER WAS ELECTED MANAGER of the Intramural 
swims at a meeting of tlie swim managers last week, with 
only one vote against himhis own. Some wise crackers may pull the 
one about the fraternities not triietlng the lodging of responsibility In 
any other fraternitys hands, but-Bauer was really elected In appre
ciation of dorm talent, and as an expression of friendship between 
the dorme and the fraternities.
Details of the Intramural swim appear elsewhere on the page, but 
there Is the matter of registration of entries which bears repeating, 
Team Managers please note; Lists of entries must be In the hands of 
Coach Rlsedorph or Manager Bauer today. '
As to the outcome of the swim, you may take it from'me that 
the Betas have an eager eye out to keep the trophy which balances

Victory Over Pelts 
Finishes Gage Season
Winners Name Inscribed with Delts, Betas on Cup 
Which T. X-s Will Keep for Ensuing Year; 
Three Wins Give Permanent Possession
By Johnny Weinberg
Tlieta Si reigns supreme in the intramirnl basketball world 
of Carnegie Tech. This team gained the title of 1935 cham
pions by defeating Dalta Tau Delta in a one-sided game lost 
Thursday evening. The score was 20-10 and as these figures 
indicate, the outcome of the game was never in doubt. The 
new champions exhibited their excellent defense again andthe Delts attempted6am the tide against them. As inmouuting ist of the ies played this season by tbe winners, the starring roles were played by BUI Splaak and Johnny Green, although no man on the Theta XI squad went unnoticed.
In the semi-final contest between McGill hall and the Theta XI Quintet, an overwhelming victory, was the result for the latter with a score of 30-9 as the total result of the boys efforts. Delta Tau Delta drew a bye in tills stage of the game.
By. winning the championship, the Theta Xi fraternity gains one leg on the miicii sought Intramural up. Delta Tau Delta and Beta
>f the cup, three victories tie won, and one may expect i quite a season next year
when these three teams once more compete to secure a firmer grasp on this very much coveted trophy.The past season was one marked with upsets and surprises. Beta Theta Pi, one of last years league champions, hampered by loss of
quintets. The McGill hall t which little was known before the season actually began, showed amazing scoring ability to run away -with their league championship. in the Federal league, the Delts and the Kappa Slgs ran neck and neck throughout the entire season climaxing It with a tie game which three overtime periods failed to break. This tie game was Anally played off,- with the Dells .finally emerging the winners; and repro sedatives of the 'Federal league.

NTERFRATERNITY council's decision to

Prudence nrevailed over hot-headedness.
Student council assumed control over the

exercised has served its purpose. The new 
plan submitted by Interfraternity council in

control is devised to prevent all possibility of 
graft. The petition, too. offers reasons that 
are sound and justifiable.

The Rah-rah boy who went to college to enjoy life and obtain some social luster, strain -ocal chords in tbe cheering, and offer to
ed Jn world affairs, government, and social and political economy, is taking the campus play-boy's place.
This is tbe encouraging announcement of Dr. Walter A. Jesaup In his Srst report as President of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. It is concurred in number of university and college editors who were queried by .The Literary Digest.
Add this evidence to tbe indications brought out by tbe Literary Digest peace poll (that serious-minded
the weight of testimony is overwhelmingly in support.->f Doctor Jessup's reporL
report, said the New York Times, furnishes profitable reading for I he presidents, trustees, teachers, and graduates of the more than 800 colleges and universities in the United States. So valuable are Its ten pages in general review of the work of the year . . .. that they should be given wider circulation/'
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland there than twenty-live.
Already, he said, there were some .American institutions which were so far from fulfilling Ihelr function that they might as well abandon the struggle. There would be others, he predicted,..which would lose ground, and some 'hich would disappear.The Issue of the struggle, asserted Doctor Jessup, will not depend on money. Survival 111 be'conditioned by intelligent leadership, high morale, and the courage to be sincere ih the students by selecting and educating em only in the Held of Institutional com- tency and in that field doing a genuine arid significant- jpb.
In the long run, colleges will be evaluated by their success in maintaining themselves as ats of learning for students and staff."
Of special Interest to parents whose eons e in college or preparing to matriculate is Doctor Jessups description of the campus-hoy of today; He Is no longer the blase, sophisticated student of the 'twenties; he is a bard -king, serious-minded person who demands -e of.the college library, the laboratory and tbe Instructor than did his brother of a decade 
>o.Views of Student Editors
Student editors from widely scattered can lses agree. In reply to The Literary Digest question, D. B. Hardeman, Editor of The Dally Texan, student publication of tbe University of Texas, said tbe rah-rah days
Mr. Hardeman, who is also president of the lotercolieglale Dally Editors' Association, wrote: Greater use of libraries, betterduct of students, demand of newspaper rea<Jathletics, greater Independence of thought; less reverence for existing; Institutions, show illege man is thinking more and playing less.
'The passing of tbe 'rah-rah' era Is a blessing of hard times, replied Albert Kosek, Editor of The Minnesota Dally, University of Minnesota. Students now want dollar for dollar values in education.
'The student has been taken down froi pedestal and is no longer expected toaglclan. If universities can adhere"to true liberalism and remain out of the clutches of politicians, they may yet save us from selves.
'The depression killed Joe College, wired Chandler Harris, Editor of The California Dally Bruin, of the University of California Los Angeles. Economic necessity has forced thought into the life of college students. Foolish hazing and tradition, exorbitantly expensive fraternities, excessive drinking and gambling disappearing. Serious thought on nomlcs and political problems Is increasing."
Equally- emphatic was the reply- from Jona; than B. Bingham, chairman, of The Yale Daily who said that the most conclusive evidence of the change In student type is that rah-rah is now a term of derision. Yale rious-nrindfcrtness is .shown by tripling regis- tration In government economics'courses,' a demand for small classes, and individual structlon.

>XOlUSton-Qf v,1oJn doHaroqthere is great progress in students awareness and. thinking.
TM. reaenLment expressed by. Mr. Bingham
A Marked Trend
The statement Is borne out as It concerns the great university at Chicago. Chicago is distinctly leGS rah-rah* since the depression and new plan, wived Howard P. Hudson, Editor of The Daily Maroon.
There is a marked trend toward academi political and international discussions by st dents, rather than the campus politics of old
Less positive, but.encouraging, Is the sage from the University of Virginia. The '"rah-rah* era ended here years ago, replied Murat Williams, Editor of College Topics. It scttt' prevails iartier South, and in sozae-Vir- glnla collges. 'Rah-rahlsm has been turned Into superficial sophistication, which may be worse. However, the. new-era shows astrong. minority Interest In public-affairs" ;

THE ANIMAL THAT LAUGHS
One day Emil Ludwig noticed a New York elevator boy reading his life of Napoleon.
So you are reading that book, are you?" remarked Hen- Ludwig. Does It interest
resemblances to my own charThis anecdote explains in part tbe appeal which biography makes to readers, it serves to explain us to ourselves. Napoleon was ambitious; I, too, am ambitious. Our problem will be somewhat the same: how to achieve that ambition, whether to let consideration for otberg deter us, or to ride roughshod over difficulties. We seek
sloiy of a superior man, be is still a-man,, so that we find In him something of ourselves. At the same time he often suggests a more heroic and noble solution to our problems than any which we would have tbe courage to conceive. We realize that others feel the same uneasiness, passion, worry, and doubt as we do. For-this reason, biography should be made the core of our 6Cheme of education. Together with psychographice, it should be put on an equal footing with our primary reading, and our high'echool and college history. Many biographies could be advantageously studied as higher English texts.
The only difference between history and biography Is that one deals with the past of man as a member of society, while the other is concerned with Individuals. -However, the history of society is tbe history of individuals because.society Is tbe creation of Individuals. If multitudinous benefits are derived from a knowledge of man's customs, Ills inventions, or his institutions, what far greater gains could' be bad from a sludy of the men who created these organizations  their inmost..plans and hopes, their alms and Ideals? A biography lays bare their souls for study and scrutiny. We can find the shade which caused the tree to lean, or the sunshine anu water which kept it straight. We cannot come from hours with Napoleon, Florence Nightingale, or Benedict Arnold, end be quite the same person. Our powers of observation, of sympatby, of reasoning, of imagination have been stretched, yet we have rccognized identical elements In ihelr problems- and ours, and have studied and compared their solutions with our own standards of right and WTong. -
In reading biographies you will -make new friends. A life of Thomas Jefferson, or Paul Sabatiers Life of St. Francis will give you a place in the best society of the worid. You will find how others mastered or compromised the experiences common to us all. If you are facing life with a handicap, you will find comfort. Beethoven composed his ninth symphony after he was so deaf thot he never heaTd a note of it. Professor Fro6t, retlredhead of the great Yerkea Observatory, has; been

Queen-Elizabeth has a high batUng-average among queens, yet medical records ascrlbje eyestrain, fits, "achy" teeth, smallpox;;: stom- ach ulcers,- dropsy, rheumatism, antfigout to her, not to mention occasional complete . breakdowns. There areso many financially handicapped among the great that one wonders If the first step to fameimight not be securing release from all bondage to property. No matter wnat your.handir cap is you will find others with the*, same symptoms if you will but open th door of biographies. ;
Even though your interest be purely fictional, you will find ihe'diversion you., seek In biographies. You will discover General Grant earning a dollar at a circus by riding a wild pony three, times around- the Ting. Though he was only twelve years old, he succeeded after two failures by jumping on backwards, gripping his short legs around the ponys belly and holding on to the tall, to the extreme delight of the crowd and tbe discomfiture of the clown.\

Night Courses 
To Be Changed
Graduate Curriculum To 
Be Longer Next Year;
. For several years the Administra
tion officials have .been consider
ing some changes in the Carnegie 
night school schedule. These 
changes would include an increase In the length of the school year, 
and corresponding decrease In the 
number of years necessary to com
plete the degree requirements. 
Such a change would mske day and jiight. courses exactly .equivalent,
would eliminate th -double standard which now exists in courses, and which advantage the school.
While no changes h uate courses are to be present, the graduate courses be changed next year.
