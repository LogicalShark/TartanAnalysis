Play Written By Milne
This year they present Michael and 
fylory, the New York success by A. 
A. Milne. In the leading roles arc 
iMadge Kennedy and Terrence Neil, 
a well-known English actor. Miss 
Kennedy is familiar to thcatcr-gocrs 
ior her work in Paris Bound and 
! Love in a Mist. Before her stage 
succcsscs, she had won considerable 
tfame on the screen. There is a cap
able supporting cast with the juvenile 
lead in the talented hands of Clinton 
Sundberg.
The plot of this play, which has 
been described as one of the most 
I moving love stories ever portrayed 
I on the stage," concerns itself with 
a ydung woman, Mary, who hap been 
'deserted by her husband; and a 
. .*.';,1p?.t1vy:ic young man, Michael who 
.conics yo her aid. In after years,
1 Miry# Husband fcturns and attempts 
tpy/rilackmail Mary and Michael, who 
{./the meantime has become a suc
cessful author. The ensuing scenes 
'prbvidc excitement, pathos, anti-milch 
(dramatic suspense.
Neatly Painted Humor 
! J. Brooks Atkinson, of the New 
.York Times, says of Michael and 
''Mary: "It is a constantly engrossing 
play with considerable charm and 
ingenious surprises. Mr. Milne paints 
entimcnt and humor as neatly as 
Barrie, and listening to it you find 
yourself subsiding into a fatuous 
content about the world in gcncrall"
The price of tickets will range. 
\ from $2.50 for orchestra seats to 50c
ifor second oalcony seats. As usual 
ithere will be a pre-sale ' on the

Ben Iden Payne to 
Present Unusual 
Play
B. Iden Payne, former head of 
the Drama department, who has 
visited Carnegie in the role of 
visiting director every year since 
his departure, is at present work
ing nvith the department on a pro
duction of St. John Hankins play 
The Charity That Began at HomCi" 
The play is a product of the Man
chester School of Playwrights of 
which. Mr. Payne was the original 
director.
A Happy Ending
This play . is one of a group 
which Hankins called four plays 
with a happy endingan ironical 
styling of each one, for as it turns 
out all end, with the breaking of 
an engagement. The first product 
tion of the play was by Granville 
Batker in 1906 at the Cort. thea
ter ijn London. It is practically 
the only play where the' author 
portrajrs himself as the lead, a 
pleasure seeker with this love of a 
carefree existence as a deliberate 
philosophy of life. At the time oi
ks first appearance, it ' was stag
gering to those who had not in
terest from a scholarly viewpoint. 
It was bewildering and strange that 
a man and woman should carry on 
a dialogue on the stage, and it is 
surprising the change' in attitude 
toward a .play, of this sort in the 
25 years since, its first' production. 
Hankins had achieved characteriza
tion' of. the most delicate texture, 
showing a penetrating knowledge of 
psychology and reactions. This is 
like Hankins who had a natural and 
most delicate type and wit. He 
was undoubtedly the coming play
wright of the age when his career 
was cut short by his early death* 
but lie is acclaimed among writers 
and the intelligentsia, although lie 
died too early to r<^iclf the public. 
Hence his work has become a 
criterion to. writers of a certain 
school, and Hankins has virtually 
become a mind for a number of 
playwrights. ~ Hankins in his time 
was a very well known figure in 
London. It is agreed that lie af
forded the original for St. John 
Hotchkiss in Shaws "Getting Mar
ried. .
Cast Is Well Chosen
The : cast includes A r-a im inta 
Gully, Elizabeth Drake, Freda Ca'zcn, Ella Iiaith, Isobel Yealjr, Fran
ces 1-I.eckcrt, Elizabeth Lamb, An
nette Dull, Eleanor Lewis, Helen1. 
Sisenwain, Dojm Bonhoff, Leo Daslibacli, Burt McKee, George Kounlz, 
Clancy . Cooper, George" Hildebrand, 
McCcllan Shinn and Edward Kelly. Q
The play will be presented-Feb
ruary 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 in the 
Little Theater.
Phi Kappa Fraternity 
Basketball Teams Lead 
Newman Club League
Tomorrow evening, 'at 7:30, the 
Plvi Kappa1, fraternity . basketball 
teams, Rlio chapter, of Carnegie 
Tech, and Mu chapter of Pitt- will 
play in the Cathedral High School 
auditorium, Fifth .aA^enue and Craig 
street. Both teams, members of 
the Newman league,, arc undefeated, 
and the winning :team will be the 
favorite to win the - tournament. 
They have practiced diligently and 
arc primed for this most important 
game.
The rivalry of the Pitt and Tech 
chapters of the fraternity has been 
traditional in the Newman Club 
League. This season with both 
teams undefeated, the rivalry has 
reached its peak and a great bat
tle is expected. The Carnegie chap
ter has an unusually strong aggre
gation this year with\ such mem
bers as Wall, MacG.uire, Schultz, 
Binder and Graveno: The Pitt
chapter also boasts of an unusually 
strong combination.
This game will be the last one 
before the tournament rounds are 
started in which the clrampion of 
the league is determined. To the 
members of the winning team small 
gold basketballs will be awarded 
as of previous years.
Immediately after the game to
morrow night the third of an un
usually pleasant scries of basket
ball dances will be held. Admis
sion' will be granted only to the 
member's and their guests. The

Committee On Song 
Contest Postpones 
Awarding Of Prizes
The chairman of the Carn'cgic 
Song Contest corpmlltce is sorry 
to announce that no awards of 
prizes shall be miftlc until the be
ginning of next semester. The de
lay is caused by the inability 'of 
the committee to convene as a 
group to give the final awards. 
Each member of the committee, 
howcvcn, has chosen five songs 
which lie considers the best, but 
the final awards must be made 
by the committee as a whole. The 
committee is comprised of Dr. Charles HeinrOth, Dean Glendinning Keeble, Mr. J. Vick OBrien, 
Dr. Will Earheart, Mr. Sullivan 
and Harold Yeager* chairman..
Methodical Maidens Manage the
Maneuvers in Modern Man-Hunt
Sally Jane was not the least bit 
c^nscicntious, but she was clever 
and-peppy. When exam time came 
around, she drew, with impudent 
delight, a scVics of cartoons that 
illustrated the theories of Berkley 
with zest and humor, instead of 
laboriously compiling the conven
tionally stupid term paper for Phil
osophy. Ginny was feeble at pars
ing and most uncertain about Greek 
accusatives, but she had a feeling 
of intimacy about the week-end 
parties up at the Sabine Farm. 
Grace, although sublimely uncon
scious of dates, was considered A 
most intelligent girl by the head 
of the Department of History, merely 
because of the passion of indigna
tion to which she was aroused be
cause Hannibal was such a grand 
person and the cards were so stack
ed against him.
But Sally Jane and Ginny and 
Grace went to college fourteen or 
more years ago, when, according 
to Agnes Rogers Hyde, writing in 
Harpers, studying spilled over into 
play. Those were, moreover, the 
years when women were free from 
the competition that spontaneously
springs up when men come into- the 
picture. These men arc the under
lying causes of the modern college 
girls insistence upon vocational 
training, and . her definite concen
tration upon one vocation in par
ticularbeing '^popular with men. 
Not only that, but thejr are indirect
ly responsible for her more serious 
attitude toward her class work 
parents to the contrarysince per
mission to go out on the precious 
^veekends is contingent upon her 
good 'scholastic standing.
Now we wonder ....
In the days when collcge girls 
played games, ran magazines, put 
on plays, sang in the glee club, and 
busied themselves with sclf-govcrnincnt and intra-mural sports, the 
mcmbc-' of the Socialist Club up
held the theory of co-education 
where young men and women 
mingled daily in earnest work. In 
fact, they held to the Utopian be
lief that when young men and 
women, mingled 1 daily they would 
jdr nothing but work. At what?
Nor is her hard-boiled attitude 
toward the business of learning how

CREDENTIALS OPENS 
AT Y.M.H.A. PLAYHOUSE
Play Brings Out Conflict Be
tween Old Russia and 
New
Those who are fortunate enough 
to attend a performance of Cre
dentials, which begins ya two night 
run at the Y. M. and W. H. A. 
Playhouse tonight, will witness a 
most unusual and interesting drama 
staged in a uniquely suggestive 
manner.
Since the play is centered chiefly 
about the conflict between the old 
Russia and the new regime, the set
tings are designed to convey; a 
suitable atmosphere, and in so do
ing Frank Stout has succeeded re
markably well.
A balcony has been erected over 
the rear stage, with stairways at 
either side; From the front of the 
balcony arc suspended papcrmache 
!figures of men prominent in the 
old Czarist .Russia. As the play 
progresses-, and' the conflict between 
the old and new is portrayed in 
the speech and actions of the char
acters, the. whole revolves to show, 
in the rear, the figures of such 
modern Russians as Lenin, Trotsky 
and Stalin. Encircling the whole 
stage is the Moscow River, which, 
for the satisfaction of those who 
insist on the genuine thing, is .con
structed with real water. To the 
right, extending out over tlie stage, 
is a gallows, whereon, during the 
course of the play, one" of the 
characters is hanged.
In addition to these unusual set
tings, Russian dances, under the 
direction of Madame Susan Kar
pova, instructor of dancing at Car
negie Tech, will be presented. The 
Russian atmosphere wil.1 be further

Collection of African 
Woodcarvings On 
Exhibition
Messrs. Kindred McLeary and 
William Perkins of the Department 
of Architecture have loaned their 
collections of 'African Avood carv
ings for an exhibition which began 
Wednesday, January 21, in the 
small museum, Collcge of Fine 
Arts. The objects included in this 
exhibition came from African dis
tricts on, the West coast, the Congo, 
Gabun, Iyory Coast, Guinea, Niger, 
and perhaps other Negro territories.
Negro art has been dead for up
wards of one hundred years, be
cause of the stifling influence of 
the encroaching stream of the 
white race upon the indigenous 
life and customs of the Negro. 
The art shown in this exhibition is 
a product of the period when the 
Negro lived free from foreign pres
sure. The predominant objects in 
the exhibition are masks used ,in 
the religious dances of the tribes 
by sorcerers or fettish makers, to 
inspire te'rror and awe in the hearts 
of beholders. There are many fulllength statues, probably fcttishcs, 
supposed to protect huts in which 
they were enshrined from inroads 
of evil spirits.

Prize Bathroom Plans 
Exhibited in Art 
School
There is now in the main exhibi
tion room in the Art School, an 
exhibition of . plans for bathrooms, 
sponsored by the Standayl Sanitarjr 
Manufacturing Company of Pitts
burgh.
Wliy shouldn't the bath room v be 
given as much consideration, as an 
interior, as the other rooms of the 
home? Just a year ago the Stand
ard Sanitary Manufacturing Company 
asked the question and, to make pos
sible an affirmative answer, intro
duced new fixture designs, and colors 
of real artistic worth.
Contest Considered 
These new forms and colors have 
inspired a new consideration for 
the long neglected bathroom. Be
ginning as a converted hall -end or a 
large closct, it becamc a room in its 
own right, essential but of no archi
tectural or decorative importance. To
day the homeowner is eager to 
realize its possibilities as an interior.
Naturally then the homeowner 
looks to the architect for a definite 
statement of these possibilities, for 
designs which will broaden the use
fulness of the bathroom and make 
it, architecturally, a worthy part of 
the home.
And so the Standard Sanitary 
Company, after consultation with a 
committee from the Pittsburgh Chap
ter, American Institute of Archi
tects, sponsored this friendly com
petition to stimulate interest and 
originality in designing a new inter
ior, the bathroom.
The committee from the Pitts
burgh Chapter, believing that a con
test of this scope would attract 
competitors from all sections of'the 
country, recommended that architects 
from Boston, New York, Chicago, 
New Orleans and San Francisco be 
asked to serve as a Jury of Award.
Members of the jury were selected 
by the directors of the Chapters of 
tl^e American Institute of Architects 
from these cities, and the profes
sional adviser was nominated by the 
directors of the Pittsburgh Chapter.
Prominent Jury 
The Jury of Awards was com
posed of the following architccts: 
Wm, H. Beers of Beers & Farley, 
New York City; Addison B. LcBoutcllicr of Ripley & LcBoutcl^ 
lier, Boston; Eugene H. Klabcr, 
Chicago; Louis C. Mullgardt, Saii 
Francisco; Allison Owen of . Diboll 
& Owen,. New Orleans.
The competition was open to archi
tccts and architectural draftsmen. De
signs could be submitted as the 
work of one or more architccts, of 
a firm of architccts, or of oijc or 
more architectural draftsmen.  /

Dr. Barrett To Talk 
On Tamest Africa
At Carnegie Institute
Dr. S. A. iir'rett, director of 
the Milwaukee Public Museum, will 
speak in the Lecture hall of the 
Carnegie Institute ' on Thursday, 
January 29, at 8:30 p. m. His lec
ture, which lie entitles Tamest 
Africa;, illustrated by lantern slides 
and motion - pictures, will tell of a 
very interesting trip which lie made 
to Africa for the purpose of study-, 
ing animals under their normal,
undisturbed condition.
Dr. Barrett on his trip took nu
merous pictures of - wild animals 
under' natural surroundings. No 
firearms were used, and the animals 
were not aware of the presence of 
man. As a result of his daring
work, Dr. Barretts set of pictures
is regarded as one of the most 
natural and interesting sets of pic
tures .of wild animals ever taken. 
It is this set that he will show
during his talk.
The lecture is free to the public,

A Ll M N I' NEWS
Plaid Five Drops 
Fast Contests To 
Pitt and Geneva
First Consecutive Defeats 
Caused By Thrilling 
Come Backs
CARNEGIE HAD THE. EDGE during 34 of the 40 
minutes of play in the Pitt game, but fell by three points before 
a closing spurt effected by the Panthers. Whether the Plaids 
suffered a momentary let-up, or whether the Pittites hit a chance 
scoring stride which yielded them the advantage, cannot be 
passed upon conclusively. It is evident, however, that no single 
factor lost the game for the Carnegians.
The first attempt made by the Carlson quintette to penetrate 
the Tartan defense resulted in the total bewilderment of the 
entire Panther machine. The demonstration was accepted by 
the spectators as a rare treat, so perfectly did the Plaid defense 
deflect the efforts of the opponents. From the very start, the 
game was branded as a close battle spurred on by the rivalry 
existing between the contenders. It was a battle, and one to be remembered among the best even though Carnegie did lose.
The championship must be decided by the outcome of only 
one more engagement, which means that if the Tartans win, 
each side will hold one victory. But the comparative scores and 
the brand of ball played will necessarily weigh heavily /in decid
ing whos who.* * * * *
THE PLEBE QUINTETTE, under the direction of Ray 
Buckley, has demonstrated that they are doing their hare to 
elevate the quality of basketball at Carnegie. No doubt remains 
.but that both 31 outfits deserve the recognition aifd support 
accorded them, but on the Yearling team rests _a great share of 
 the responsibility associated with future Varsity aggregations.
The team as a unit outsmarted the Pitt Ereshmen and dis
played a style of dribbling, passing, and shooting superior to 
their rivals of not only this year,- but for three years to come. 
It is a satisfaction, indeed, to know that Carnegies future in the 
sport has a bearing; such as Buckleys team appears to.be.
* * * * *
Carnegie will meet the Genevians again March 10 on the 
gym floor in the closing game of the season. It is certain that, 
with their pet advantage of a miniature floor left at home, the 
Beaver Falls cagers will experience new and manifold difficul
ties when they meet the Tartans that night.
A team, having practiced and played on a standard floor, 
cannot be expected to do its very best on a small space which cramps formations and hinders their style of play. The Tartans, 
in the return engagement, will be at home and play their best 
to finish the season rightand to prove what they can do on a 
good floor.* * * * *
BIG ED STENTZ certainly upset the dope last Wednesday in the, Pitt encounter. "Buzz Albright, Panther center, was 
heralded as the one man who would prove a deciding factor for 
the Blue and Gold. Eocal newspapers proclaimed him as the
sophomore star surpassing all othei*s, meaning of course our
own trio of Stentz, Smith, and Fergus. The scribes conceded 
him the tip-off by a wide margin, and couldn't add enough 
about His scoring ability.
vStentz, who has frequently been referred to as the weak 
link, came through, nevertheless, in fine style and got the tip- off consistently. He also scored three points against Albrights 
four. Whats more, Ed played a big part in the new zone 
defense and his teamwork FEB. unsurpassed.
* * i< * *
TRACJC AND TENNIS PROSPECTS have taken a boost lately due to the recent announcement that spring football 
training is to be abandoned. The ten-day practice period hardly gave ample time to accomplish much, and the coachcs arc of 
the opinion that the calibre of next seasons team will not be 
affcctcd by the decision.
* * * * *
SPEAKING OF SPRING SPORTS, a number of the track 
men are already hard at work. Several of the more prominent 
members of the squad are working out regularly over at Pitts 
indoor track in the hope of. entering some of the indoor meets in the near future.
The privilege extended! the Carnegians by the Pit'i officials is to be recognized as a courtesy indicative of the fine, relation
ship existing between the two schools in spite of the keen rivalry in all sports.
CARNEGIES SOPHOMORE FLOORMEN
For the first time this season, 
Carnegie's basketball team dropped 
two conscoutive games. Saturday night 
the under-rated Geneva College five 
staged a whirlwind finish to hand 
the Tartans a 32-26 setback. The 
other defeat was suffered at the 
hands of the Pitt cagers and was 
likewise caused by a rally in the 
closing minutes which enabled the 
Panthers to capture a 25-22 verdict.
Playing on a two by four high 
school gym floor, the Carnegie team 
got of to a good start against the 
Geneva five by piling up 12 points 
before their opponents broke into 
the scoring. Stcntz was getting the 
jump consistently for the plaid and 
the tcani was clicking 'off ,plays in 
fine style. *
Seeing that their opponents were 
stronger, the Geneva boys adopted 
the gct-thc-ball and shot method, 
and although many of their shots 
Were freak1 attempts, the law of 
averages wits not to be ignored and, 
despite the fact that the percentage 
of shots that went for points, was 
small, the Covenanters brought the 
score to 19-17 as the half ended. 
Although the Pittsburgh boys . were 
still ahead they suffered a big loss. 
Ed. Stcntz was forced to leave the 
game on personals. Merten, who re
placed him, failed to get the jump 
consistently and the chances for team 
play on the part of the Tartans 
was diminished.
The Geneva boys continued their 
reckless shooting and managed to! 
stay abreast of the Tartan five 
throughout the early part of the sec? 
ond half. The scorcs was finally tied 
with eight  minutes of play remain
ing. The Covenanters got by the 
Carnegie defense for a field goal and, 
added a foul to their total to bring; 
the score to 29-26. At this stage 
the Geneva boys started to stall ajjd j 
when the Plaid tried to cover they 
slipped by for three more points 
making the final score 32-26.
Captain Ncasc was the'star of the! 
game from the Carnegie standpoint. 
George got the range on the basket 
once more and lead the evenings', 
scoring, sinking four field goals and 
three fouls to capture the honors 
from Aultman of the visitors who 
had a 'like number of field, goals 
but only a, single free throw.
The much heralded Pitt-Carncgie; 
game proved to be all that .{. had 
been talked up to be. A close guard
ing, cautious type of ball was play
ed by both teams throughout the 
largest part of the game, the lead 
see-sawing back and forth with 
neither outfit able to gain a dccided 
advantage until the closing ' minutes 
of play when Pitt jumped ahead 
and emerged a three point victor, 
25-22.
The Carhcgic five, flashing a fiveman /one defense, for 'the first time 
this season, had the visitors helpless 
throughout the major portion of the 
contest, and it was not until the 
Plaid had adopted the man-to-man 
method that the Panthers pulled out.
The Tartan five got away to an 
early lead, scoring on three foul 
throws, while the Pitt quint failed to 
register during the first eleven min
utes' of action. After the Panthers 
finally got started the game balanced 
back and forth, neither team able 
to muster any kind of a lead. The 
half ended with the Tartans leading 
9-8.
The fine early season showing of this years Tartan floor squad has been due in no small measto the steady play of the Sophomore members of the squad. Smith, Fergus and Stentz are all mem
bers of the starting five and Sicgal is Coach Hogans most used reserve. Bob Smith has lead the
scoring for the Skibos in the majority of contests to date, while Fergus has attracted much atten
tion by his fine guarding and expert foul shooting! Stentz, the third members of the starting trio,
seems to be the solution to the center position problem that has been worrying Tartan coaches for 
a long time. Siegal has been teaming opposite Fergus when Jimmy Leonard isnt in the game and 
has given a good account of himself under fire. Curly has quite a reputation as a long range bas
ket scoring artist but hasnt had much chance to demonstrate his skill this season._________________
TWO HUNDRED GAMES is the quota set for the Inter 
Fraternity-Dormitory Basketball League. Now that the schedules have been defmitefy arranged and the opening date an
nounced, practice sessions have become a serious matter with most entrants.
The twenty-six teams are divided into three groups, the 
National and American Leagues each being composed of nine 
teams, and the Federal outfit of eight. It also happens that the 
three teams who won the league titles last year will have a 
chance to repeat the stunt again this season, each one being ii a different combine. e
One of the dorm teams needed another player, so the eligi-  bility rules have been altered slightly. Several teams, however, 
will benefit by the new rulings which should also speed up the brand of ball in some of the contests.

At the start of the sccond period 
the Panthers went ahead, 10-9, but
their lead was short-lived for the 
Skibo quint registered a two-pmntcr! 
and held the margin until, with but,
five minutes to go, they had the
Panthers 16-13. The Pitt squad led 
by Lowry alid Arturc, then came 
through with rapid baskets and once 
more went intg the lead, With their 
opponents ahead and the last seconds 
of play rapidly ticking by, the Tar
tans were forced to abandon the 
five man defense that had been so 
successful to this point. As' soon as 
the Carnegie boys left their air tight 
formation the Pitt five went ahead 
23-16.
Then with the original  five back
in' the game, after some desperate 
juggling by Coach Hogan in an at
tempt lo stop the Panther rampage, 
the Carnegie boys staged one 6f the 
greatest comebacks ever witnessed on 
the Tartan fl<?or and sunk three 
basketsvin rapid succcssion to bring 
the score to 23-22. With less than 
a minute to play, the.. Carnegie team 
staked all on the next tip-off, but 
Albright got the jump and Lawry 
had little trouble- scoring the final 
points, for both Carnegie guards had 
gone down the floor on the play.

Four Opposing Teams 
In Opening Encounter
Carnegies 31 rifle team started the 
season off with a bang by defeating 
its four opponents by, a score of 
1826. The total, although low for a 
winner, bettered North Carolina 
States tally of 1824 by two points. 
Rose Polytechnic was a distant third 
with only 1798, and Georgetown and 
Johns Hopkins brought up the rear 
with counts of 1782 and 1790 re
spectively.
 The results 'of the meet, Shot dur
ing the week ending, January 17, 
were compaied  by mail. Manager 
Bcamer had at first expressed dis
appointment in Carnegies scorcs, but 
when compared with the opponents, 
he found his team the victors. The 
squad has been seriously liandicapped 
by the lack of practice during the 
period of reconstruction at the range. 
Moreover, several new candidates arc 
expected to turn out within a few 
days, which should materially 
strenghten the squad.

We may consider Carnegies win
ter sport program well under way 
when the Dorm and Fraternal orders 
get down to serious work and ex
hibit some of the various methods 
of playing basketball. The commit
tee in charge of this Inter-Mural 
activity has set forth the rules 
and likewise a schedule which con
tains no less than 200 games.
A total of 26 teams are in the 
competition, the Plii Della Taus be
ing the only new-comers for this 
year. Each team plays about one 
night a wjcck beginning February 17. 
Winners of the three leagues will 
be definitely known by the middle of 
April, at which time the triangular 
round robin will be held.
With the growing (interest in prac
tice sessions, it is expected that 
the usual top-notch competition will 
prevail. There are, no doubt, several 
dark horses in the making right, now 
some of which will remain that color 
even until next year, while others 
will cast a few shoes into that ring 
which is sacred to the winners. The 
latest reports show that one team 
of the fraternal type has reached 
their minimum training requirement 
of two packs of cigarettes and one 
cigar per day. This is a wise step 
for the fifteen-minute halves will be 
crowded with the fastest kind of 
play.
It is with astounding interest that 
we note the incident which occurred

NEXT ARTS DANCE TO 
BE HELD FEBRUARY 7
' I . see they are paging another 
contrib of the Plaid, H. A. P. I 
am wondering where they will find 
him. Possibly under too many 
books, etc., and when I think of 
books, the next question which sug
gests itself is the Book Review. I 
hope we will have one of these 
soon. You know, this, in a way, 
is like a literary lunch, you get all 
the facts in a short space of time, 
and time to the night student is 
a very valuable consideration. I 
read the book review of that night 
student E. DeL. and I dont have 
to read "the books. Concentration, 
and how. It is just like conserving, 
no I doni mean Forests, but they 
too should and- do receive some 
consideration as indicated in the 
Jast Plaid page. I, however, like my 
Christmas Trees, and hope nobody
will pass a law which will prohibit
the cutting of them.
Starting this week we go into
the second semester, and there will 
be. some new students on the
campus who have just registered. 
They will see this column for the 
first time, and will wonder how a 
night student could be idle. Well 
they have a lot to learn and heres 
hoping they don't take a long time 
to learn it. The week starts on 
Monday and ends on Friday and, 
with class attendance and assign
ments, tthey wont find time to be 
very busy. A little advice, it dont 
cost anything, dont miss any as 
signments, because if you do, they 
arj hard to catch up with. I know, 
because I am so far back now that 
I cant tell where to start. If you 
dont think so, ask somebody who 
has done it.
Well there is a new pastime on 
the program now since the commis
sion has reported its findings. This 
glorious occupation is Wickershamingnow dont that sound 
handsome. If you get into a tight 
pinch, all you have to say is you 
arc Wickcrshaming. These com
mittees are all a lot of bunk. . It 
seems' all they do is start some
thing, make a voluminousthats a 
five dollar wordreport, and slide 
out. of the picture when something 
big. and startling is expected. Id 
like .to be on one .of those com
mittees, Id . show them something, 
and it wouldnt be Wichcrshaming.
The Night College of Fine Arts 
will hold its second dance on Feb
ruary 7 in the Union. The com
mittee has a novel scheme for this 
affair, one -which has not been tried 
before, so they will not let us in 
on the secret, but at all events we 
know that is is going to be good. 
The orchestra \vill measure up to 
any that has been engaged for their 
dances, and from that we know it 
will be a good one.
Tickets are being distributed to 
the night art students, and these 
together with the registration card 
will secure admission. Reserve this 
dateFebruary 7for the dance 
and be sure to be out for the 
festivities.
Notice to Night Arts Workers
The members of the Social Com
mittee of the Night College of Fine 
Arts, together with those who arc 
working on these arts affairs are 
expected to be out on Saturday 
afternoon, February 7 at 2:00 p. m. 
at the Union to put the hall in 
shape for the dance in the evening.

Winning Drawings Of 
Bathroom Contest 
Exhibited On Campus
There is a very fine exhibition of 
the principal prize drawings which 
Were submitted in a recent com
petition sponsored by the Standard 
Sanitary Manufacturing Company of 
Pittsburgh in the exhibition room 
of the College of Fine Arts, Car
negie Institute of Technology. The 
showing will continue until Jan
uary 31.
The competition became interna
tional in scope when' contestants 
from Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Eng
land, France, Austria, Germany, 
Sweden, Japan, in addition to the 
United States, sent in their, draw
ings.
Considerable interest was created 
in the design for a bathroom for a 
small house as well as a plan for 
one of unrestricted treatment. Sev
eral prizes were offered for the 
solution of the problem, and the 
drawings arc well worth a visit. 
announces the rcccnt death of L. 
A. Dietz, a former night student 
in the Department ,of Industrial 
Education. We offer our deep 
sympathy to the members of his 
family.

And there will be a grand influx of ma

In an endeavor to get an idea 
of the status of the unemployment 
situation in this district, a census 
is being taken by the United States 
Bureau of the Census. The enum
erators have been selected from 
those men and women who were 
employed in taking the population 
census last April. The plan in a 
general way is as follows:
Each enumerator is required to 
visit every family residing in the 
district to which he is assigned. He 
is to ascertain the name of the head 
of the family,-the number of per
sons in the family, including room
ers and lodgers. He is also to in
quire whether there is any person 
in the family who usually works at 
some gainful (money-earning) oc
cupation, and, who for any reason 
is not working at the present time. 
If they are hnemployed, the anSwer 
should be "yes for any such per
son who, for any reason, whether 
because of inability to find work, 
sickness, -etc., was not working on 
the day preceding the enumerators 
visit, Sunday or holiday excepted.
If there is no such person in the 
family, the enumerator will make 
no further inquiry. However, if 
there is some person or persons 
Who usually work at a gainful oc
cupation but is not working at the 
time, the enumerator is required 
to obtain information regarding that 
person which includes the industry 
and occupation at which he usually 
works, whether lie lias a job or 
not, the length of time he had been 
laid off or out of work or without 
a job, together with other facts 
and information needed to give a 
true and correct understanding of 
the conditions which exist as re
gards unemployment at the present 
time in the district.
The families of the night students 
will, no doubt, be visited by these 
enumerators in-the next few weeks 
and the Plaid is publishing this in
formation so that as much co
operation as possible will be ex
tended to these enumerators of the 
Government'when they call at their 
homes.
EXAMINATION WEEK
After perusing this weeks batch 
of books, all I can say is that S. S. 
Van Dincs new book is still anxious
ly awaited by at least one- alleged 
book-rcvicwcr. Nothing like a couple 
of murders later" explained in the 
fifth dimension, to cure one of the 
clouded mind resultant of reading 
the current literature. Get on.
THE OTHER HALF is by 
Charles Francis Coc. In ease you 
dont know, its another gangster 
story. The only redeeming feature 
about the book is that Coc wrote it. 
I like his writing but too much is 
enough. The plot is negligible' but 
one wonders if so much lawlessness 
is really current in our citics, or is 
oiie being naive in saying so? Any
way, when Scarvak, the hero, is sent 
daisy-picking youll get a thrill. Its 
about the best account of a gang
sters killing that Ive read in a long 
while.
THE BORGIAS; OR, AT THE 
FEET OF VENUS is by Vincent B. 
Ibanez. Personally I prefer, The 
Rollo Boys at Dear Old Curry; or, 
Do They Get Their Man? by 
Corey Ford, but who am I? Then 
again you might like Ibanez. The 
Borgias ought to make a gr-r-r-and 
novel but Ibanez, who must be a 
local censor in his home town, has 
excluded almost all that might be 
construed as pernicious wickedness, 
leaving only doings that any amateur 
psychoanalyst could defind as repres
sion, heredity, etc. Well . . .
NAKED ON ROLLER SKATES' 
(what a title, what a title!) is by

BETTER HOMES
PARKING REGULATIONS
Now that the examinations arc 
over, or most of them, we feel that 
honorable mention is due those who 
survived the semi-annual version of 
the night schools worst period. 
Exam., week is our "hell week, with 
an entirely different, meaning than is 
attached to the day school function 
which goes by that name.
While it is largely our own faults 
if a poor grade 'is made, it would 
seem that there arc some extenuating 
circumstances in many cases which
alter the aspect of the flunk so
much that there is good reason to
examine closely those details which 
can affect our grades. Leaving cir
cumstances beyond our control out 
of the question, such as illness, busi
ness duties and the like, we attempt 
to get to the heart of the trouble 
by investigating those matters which 
seem to be remediable.
Too many of us are prone to
blame the school for the fact that 
our too often self-styled brilliancy is 
not allowed a tinkers chance to 
show itself. Grant that. Standarization of thought to enable the pas
sage of as large a body of graduates 
as possible seem to be the motive 
of schools at present. This is oc
casioned mostly by the pitiable over
crowded conditions' of most of these 
schools. Fortunately, high standards 
arc maintained here. In most col
leges, mass, production and line as
sembly of knowledge seem to be 
forging ahead of the now antiquat
ed (?) ideas that produced some of 
the worlds greatest minds. The 
condition cannot be rectified. In the 
past, a college graduate was a rarity. 
Now that they are being turned out 
as fast as Fords, there is little de
mand for them and they are left 
with - the impression that somebody 
has been reading Hans Andersen, 
Vols. I and II to them for quite a 
while.
Undoubtedly, when better methods 
of education are- to be had, this 
country will lead in their adoption, 
but until that time, we fear that 
the general public is going to accept 
the movii version of the college man 
as the type form, and give them just 
as much recognition as this type de
serves.
Why doesnt sombody start a 
Cafeteria College? McG.
For the benefit of all students 
Who drive to school the Plaid is 
again publishing the rules and regu
lations concerning the parking of 
automobiles on the campus. New 
students who arc registering fjr the 
second semester arc especially re
quested to study these rules so that 
they will bccomc accustomed to them.
Although the city officers who 
patrol this section are very lenient 
at times and have given warnings, 
it is, nevertheless, necessary for 
tliem to do their duty with the re
sult that many tags have been dis
tributed since Jast fKll. By adhfcring 
to these rules, the night students can 
save themselves a good many dollars.
On page thirty in the Night Stu
dents handbook we read:
Special parking rules have been 
established and the night students 
arc expected to abide by these rules. 
This course has been decided upon 
in order to safeguard all concerned. 
The following rules apply as to 
parking:
No parking is permitted on the In
dustries side of the drive paralleling 
Industries and Langley Lab. (The 
name of this drivct, is Frew strict 
and it continues up the hill to the 
Park Mansions).. However, right 
angle to the curb parking is permit
ted on the Park side of this street, 
from the gym down past the In
dustries building. Machines should 
be parked with the rear to the em
bankment. They should also be park
ed reasonably close together so that 
as large a number as possible can 
be accommodated. Parking at any 
time on cither side of Frew street 
from the gymnasium up the hill to 
Park Mansions is prohibited and any 
car parked there will be towed away. 
This rule is strictly enforced.
No parking is permitted on the 
Quadranglenor between barriers on 
this drive at any time. This > rule 
must be strictly observed.
No parking is permitted on the 
drive between the Fine Arts build
ing and Langley Lab.
Parking is permitted on both sides 
of Woodlawn avenue, from Forbes 
up to the intersection with Frew, 
street and the Park driveway.* Fire 
hydrants and driveways, however, 
must be kept clear. Parking is per
mitted along the Park driveways ex
cept where there are no parking 
signs posted. The intersection of 
Frew street, Woodlawn avenue and 
the Park driveway must be kept clear 
at all times. This is a dangerous 
intersection and any car parked pafet 
the yellow curb lines will be towed 
away.
These rules are in force at- all 
times; dances, smokers and basketball 
games bring many cars whose drivers 
are not acquainted with the regula
tions. Make your visiting friends ac
quainted with these rules and you 
may save them the price of a green 
tickct.
G.
A yearly nation-wide competition 
has been established to promote and 
encourage the building of small 
homes. Three gold medals arc offered 
annually as rewards for the best 
small homes erected during that 
year. This movement has the en
dorsement of Dr. Wilbur, Sccrctarjr 
of the Interior, and president of the 
society, as well as President Hoover, 
who is credited with the idea, and 
who is the present , vice: president. 
These men arc assisted by a com
mittee of five prominent architects 
appointed by the American Institute 
of Architects;
That this is a movement in the 
right direction, must be acknowledged. 
The foundation of our nations great
ness is in the small home and the 
higher the standard of the home, the 
more secure will be our national 
prosperity and greatness. In rcccnt 
years, we have seen a bigger trend 
toward individuality and individually 
owned homes. This is a gratifying 
situation, especially so to the archi
tectural profession. Apartment houses 
seem to spring up all around us. 
and the building of individual homes 
is a pleasing contrast.. \
To stimulate the betterment of 
design and construction of small 
homes is the direct aim of the pro
fession in establishing these awards 
and the reaction within the ranks 
of the architects themselves is most 
noticeable. The public is becoming 
more aware of the fact that good 
architecture is both pleasing and de
sirable and the steady demand for 
the architects scrvicc is the result. 
Building speculation without the serv
ices of an architect is diminishing 
rapidly, and this is especially noticc
ablc in our own Pittsburgh district. 
This should not be wondered at very 
much, because right in our midst we 
have our own college which sets a 
very high standard in construction 
and design. Included in the ranks 
of the foremost architects arc gradu
ates of Carnegie Tech and they 
reflect favorably on the profession.

BLACK FOG
Not many weeks ago, the world 
was not only startled but mysti
fied to read of the fog that had 
spread over sections of Belgium, 
and was reputed to be causing the 
death of men and Cattle in the 
affected districts. Many theories 
were evolved at the time of the 
occurrence, but it was not until 
the .excitement had subsided that 
any progress was made.
Among the numerous theories that 
were advanced was the loosening 
of the gases from an old ammuni
tion dump that had befcn long for
gotten since the war; poisoning of 
the drinking water, coincident with 
the fog; the passing of the comets 
tail, and a host of other suggcstioh$ each more fantastic than the 
last.
The guess that seems to be the 
most probable, and widely accept
ed, is the fact that there is a pos
sibility tha.t sulphur dioxide from 
the mills and factories around the 
region, might have combined with 
the water vapor composing the 
fog, producing sulphuric acid.
This theory is born out by the 
data collected on the effects of the 
fog on those affected. The acid 
would affect the throat, would be 
pungent, would cause the yellow 
marks described and would be 
more likely to affect the aged or 
already weakened than the young 
or strong. These qualifications 
seem to make this guess the most 
probably correct, although noth
ing certain can be determined, dw/ 
ing to the lack of forethought on 
the part of those on the scene 
when they neglected to bottle a 
few samples1- of the atmosphere for 
analysis. McG.

FREAK COMPRESSED
AIR WELLS
About five years ago, near Snyder, 
Texas, a drilled hole which was a 
potential oil well suddenly went hay
wire. Instead of the expected gush 
of natural gases, and possibly oil, 
which was expected a gusher was 
started that produced the queerest of 
all subterranean productscompres
sed air. With the temperature at the 
surface between ninety and one hun
dred degrees, the air rushing out of 
the well was so cold that the der
rick was soon covered with frozen 
moisture. The flow was finally 
brought under control for safetys 
sake, and as usual someone thought 
that there was no apparent sense in 
letting such a supply of rcfrigcrativc 
gases go to waste, so preparations 
were made to use the cold gases in 
the refrigeration of meats and vege
tables. Since then, several similar 
wells have been brought in.
After some time, another use was 
found which has many more practical 
applications than that of freezing 
things. The air proceeding from the 
wells is naturally under quite a pres
sure, and some fertile brain devised 
the idea of turning the gases into 
the boilers of local industrial plants 
as a substitute for steam. Now, near
ly all the supply is being used for 
this purpose, with eminent satisfac
tion being registered by the users.
The scientific explanation of the 
wells is still to be formulated, al
though many eminent scientists have 
examined and tested the wells and 
their products. At first, the gas was 
thought to be helium, but analysis 
showed it to be pure oxygen. One 
of the suggestions offcrtd is that the 
corc of the earth is frozen, but since 
this is so directly opposite to the

The Womens Scholarship Organization
Once more the Womens Scholarship Organization is 
brought to your attention. We cannot remind you too 
often of the worthiness of this organization and of your duty 
to support its activities. Too much can never be said by us 
or by anyone else on this sco're.Next month they are presenting A. A. Milnes splendid play, 
Michael and Mary, starring Madge Kennedy. If one can believe the critics and the theater-going public, attendance at this 
play will resemble a duty in no way, but is more liable to be 
one of the outstanding theatrical pleasures of the season.More than ever, at this time, potential scholarship holders' 
need your aid. Helping someone through one more semester may be sufficient to tide her over current financial distress and 
will, in all probability, be the factor in deciding whether she will 
be able to complete her course at Carnegie.Surely everyone goes to theater at least once a year. For 
the sake of your own enjoyment and your obligation to your 
sister students let this be the time to go. It is such an easy 
way of being philanthropic.

INTER-MURAL CAGE
(Continued from Page Two) 
fwent through the proceedings, and 
I the fact was revealed to him that 
a balance of $4.59 remained on the 
books from the Inter-Mural Basket
ball League of 1928. The committee 
,was convinced of the situation, and 
no time was lost in passing' a mo
tion to acccpt the belated bequest. It 
is rum or eel that this amount will be 
used to furnish the referees with 
; chewing gum, to save wear and tear 
on the whistles.
This years eligibility rules were 
altered a bit from those of previous 
seasons. . For the coming InterMural schedule, a man is ineligible 
to play if lie is a member of the 
varsity or freshman squads when the 
first league game is played. Men 
 who have participated in any varsity 
game this season arc ineligible, and 
likewise those who have earned a 
letter in basketball at any time arc 
; nlsrt ineligible. However, this ruling 
nllows any non-letter men who have 
played varsity basketball in seasons 
previous to the present one, to play 
an the coming Inter-Mural games.
Games may be postponed by the 
mutual agreement between the mali
ngers of both teams. This agreement, 
must be 'approved by the President 
of the/1. F. D. B. B. L. before 5:30 
p. m. on the day precccding the 
game. The postponed game must be 
played, within two weeks of the 
original, date.
Messrs. Risedorph and Moses 
(will carry the official duties with an 
additional referee to be selected. The 
entrance fees take care of the cups 
. for the three league winners and the 
;winner in the finals. It is the custom 
for the winners and runners-up0 at 
Pitt arid Carnegie to finish up' the 
season with a city championship game.

Howdy, You All!
The Sophomores, led by Charlie 
Schatvet and Harry Hower, succeed
ed in giving the frosh the run around 
Friday night when they held their 
annual banquet at the Show Boat 
Club Sixth street and Duqucsne 
way. About half of the freshman 
class went out to the Penn Lincoln 
Hotel in Wilkinsburg, on a wild 
Soph chase. The freshman almost 
spoiled the party when they abscond
ed ^ith John Kronenbcrg, who was 
supposed to tell all the Sophomores 
at the last minute where the ban
quet would be held. He just man
aged to get the word to the crowd 
in time.
, The management of the Show Boat 
understood that the banquet was to 
be a fraternity affair. When the boys 
arrived and someone said something 
about "Freshmen, the managerial 
cars stood up, because the Show 
Boat is accustomed to refined, order
ly gatherings; only. That is, on Fri
day nights! Impressed by the inno
cent smiles of Charlie and Harry, 
however, the management permitted 
the proceedings to go on, and the 
Sophomore Class of 1931 to be a 
success.
The basketball team lost to 
Pitt but Carlson and the Panthers 
havent gotten: their breath back 
yet. The Tartans fought hard Wed
nesday night because they had a 
wonderful example of courage and 
sacrifice set before them. The lit

ed character and fighting spirit 
that is seldom seen, by his act 
that night. We appreciate it, Jim

The rifle teams, mens and wom
en^, have started their season and 
arent missing manjr. Ed. McCloskey 
says girls arc asked to come out for 
the womens team, the only require
ment being that they .he nice looking. 
If nice enough, they  can be taught 
to shoot. Ed. McCloskey, D. H. E. 
Genter, and Paul Pludson arc some 
of the coaches, girls. D. H. E. must 
be tired . waiting . for candidates, as 
lie sat with the Betas cook at. the 
Pitt game.
The rifle range seems quite a birth
place for romances. Kay Boyd and 
Alex Fisher of last years class be
came quite good friends after Kay 
shot Alex in the leg one day, and 
she wasnt seeing a red Itace cither,. 
Its just a modern version of Cupids 
arrow. All you have to do is go 
out for. rifle and shoot them in the 
leg,: girls, and they fall for you, 
quick-like.
Libby. Lilley is captain of the 
Womens rifle team. She has quite 
an advantage over the other girls, 
since, hailing from Chicago, she has 
a chance for lots of summer train
ing. Her motto is, "Go out for'rifle, 
and never fear, the racketeer!
Since. this is the last time we get 
together T until after the massacres 
called exams, a pep talk would be 
proper. You cant give a pep talk, 
however, if youre scared to death, 
so just try Kelloggs much adver
tised breakfast food and hope for the 
best.

'Til Then
Think It Over
The January issue of the Ameri
can Mercury contains an editorial 
which discusses the merits of modern 
inventions. Mencken devotes a good 
part of the article to explaining his 
particular dislike for the telephone.
 What we call progress/ said 
Havelock Ellis, is the exchange of 
one nuisance for another nuisance. 
The thought is so obvious that it 
inust occur now and then even to 
the secretary of the Greater Zenith 
Booster League. There may be  per
sons who actually enjoy the sound 
of the telephone bell, but if they 
exist I can only say that I have 
never met them. It is highly probable 
that the telephone, as it stands to
day, represents more sheer brain 
power than any other human in
vention. A truly immense ingenuity 
h'as gone into pcrfccting it, and it 
is as far bc3Tond its progenitor of 
1900 as the Europa is beyond Ful
tons Clermont. But all the while no 
one has ever thought of improving 
the tone of its bell. The sound re
mains intolerably harsh and shrill, 
even when efforts are made to damp 
it. With' very little trouble it might 
be made ! deep, sonorous or even 
soothing. But- the telephone engineers 
let it remain as it was at the' start, 
and millions of people suffer under 
its assault at every hour of the 
day.
The telephone, I believe, is the
greatest boon to bores ever invented. 
It has set their ancient art upon 
a new level of efficiency and enabled 
them to penetrate the last strongholds 
of privacjr. All of the devices that 
have been put into service against
them have failed. I point, for ex
ample, to that of having a private 
telephone number, not listed in the 
book. Obviously there is nothing here 
to daunt a bore of authentic gifts. 
Obtaining private telephone numbers 
is of the elemental essence of his
craft. Such things arc swapped by 
bores as automatically as New York
ers svvap the addresses of speakeasies.
Thus the poor victim of their pro
fessional passion is beset quite .as 
much as if he had his telephone 
number, limned upon the sky in 
smoke. But meanwhile his friends 
forget it at critical moments and he 
misses much pleasant gossip  and 
manj* an opportunity for vinous re
laxation.
It is not only hard to imagine a 
world without telephones; it be
comes downright impossible. They 
have become as- necessar}1- to the 
human race, at least in the United 
States, as window glass, newspapers 
or bicarbonate of soda. Every'" now 
and then one hears of a man who 
has removed to some remote village 
to get rid of them, and there pro
poses to meditate and invite his soul 
in the manner of the Greek philoso
phers, but almost always it turns out 
that his meditations run in'the direc
tion of rosicrucianism, the Single 
Tax, farm relief, or some other such 
insanity. I have mysclF~ordered my 
telephone taken out at least a dozen 
times, but every time I found urgent 
use for it before the man arrived, 
and so had to meet him with ex
cuses and a drink. A telephone big
wig tells me that Such orders come 
in at the rate of scores a day, but' 
that none has ever been Executed. I 
now have two telephones in my house 
and am about to put in a third. In 
ten years no doubt there will be one 
in every room, as in hotels.
Despite all this I remain opposed 
to the telephone . theoretically, and 
continue to damn it. It is a great 
invention and of vast value to the 
human race, but . I. believe it has 
done me, personally, almost as much 
harm as good. How .often a single 
call has blown,1 up my whole, eve
nings work, and exacerbated my 
spirit and diminished my income! I 
am old enough to remember when, 
telephones - were very rare, and ro
mantic enough to believe I was hap
pier then.

PRESIDENT BUTLERS
ATHLETIC RECORD
Excerpts from Letter by J. MeKccn Cnttell.
-----2------
In a press release or interview, 
widely published on January 10, the 
president of Columbia university 
said that he had received more than 
6,000 clippings about his report on 
athletics. Now he will receive m'offc, 
including this one. Dr. Butler said 
in his release You rarely hear from 
me and The American-public and 
press lack a sense of humor, in 
which latter respect, however superior 
in others, he appears to be a mem
ber bf the. public. When in 1902 I 
asked President  Eliot his opinion 
of our then new president lie said 
onlyI think that lie would have 
approved my now making the quota
tion-^Dr. Butleris- a veryenter
prisingyoung man. . . . ..
As- I ani about to make some 
frivolous remarks about Dr. Butler,
I should like to state that I regard 
him as a man of unusual ability, who, 
if his ambition' had 'been, fulfilled, 
would1 have been a. better' president 
of the United States' than some of 
those who have held, the office, iriuch 
better than Mr. Harding, for whose 
nomination Dr. ' Butler ' claimed the 
credit after the Republican National 
Convention. As I remember it he 
said in effect that as the --.French 
soldiers at Verdun had sacrificed their 
lives for their country, so had he, 
in handing for the sake1 of;'harmony 
to Mr. Harding the nomination that 
he could have had, sacrificed his 
future for the welfare of the party, 
and the nation.
Dr. Butlers scheme to abolish gate 
receipts and depend-ion gifts from 
the alumni for the support of athle
tics is about- twent3--fivc jears1. out 
of date.; I made ; a -similar proposal, 
as did others, that long 'ago, together 
with one that I regard :as of more, 
consequence, namel3r, that there be, 
for example, twenty football patches 
between Harvard and Yale, played 
on the same day, half;'in Cambridge 
and half in New Haven,  as many 
simultaneously as fields (there .were 
no stadia in- those days) would per
mit. I tried to make such an ar
rangement between the University of 
Pennsylvania and Columbia, two city 
universities having similar problems. 
This plan would, abolish objection
able professionalism, .would, allow 
many students to train and compete, 
and would, ishould suppose, make 
a large appeal to the public. 
Dr. Butlers account of nis part in 
the athletic situation at Columbia is 
doubtless correct, but it is not com
plete. lie says that football was 
abolished at Columbia in 1905 on the
First Church of Christ

advice of the committee on athletics. 
He docs not tell us that he appointed 
a small committee of three instructed 
to do this. At that time >thcrc had 
been several deaths on the football 
field and a confcrcncc of university 
presidents had been called to con
sider the subject. Dr. Butler appar
ently assumed that football of that 
kind would be abolished, and that 
lie would get the credit for kicking 
the cat in the direction that... it 
jumped...................
There seems to' be no objection 
whatever to crediting toward a' de
gree the time students spend on 
football. In my day Columbia did 
so, for it required gymnasium work 
and credited it> toward the degree, 
very properly excusing from the 
drill of the gymnasium students 
who spent the time in out-of-door 
games. Wc should have schools of 
athletics, as avcII as schools of jour
nalism and of business, ;tnd should 
give'academic-honor's and Phi Beta 
Kappa'-keys to students who exccl. 
The question of -the 'degree is Sim
plified by the circumstance that 
B.A. stands for. bachelor of athle
tics. Not only coaches, but also 
professors of physical training and 
athletics arc needed-. It is a pro
fession as honorable,- and in the 
case of the. coaches as well paid, as 
that of the criminal lawyer or uni
versity president.
It may seem- unbecoming, almost 
sacrilegious, to. speak without rev
erence of a man so . prominent as 
the president pfv^oluriibia Univer
sity. He, however, has set the ex
ample,'' for. he called President 
Roosevelt a demagogue and Pres
ident Wilson a- charlatan. Of 
General Wood and- of Mr. Hoover v 
he spoke in terms that I do not 
exactly recall, but I do remember 
that General Wood, replied, desig
nating, Dr. Butler as a fakir and 
the uttcrer of a lie, and that Dr. 
Butler then made a public apology. 
Poor me he called a cancer in 
the cutting part of which the 
Trustees collectively acted the part 
of. surgeons . with admirable skill." 
This, however, appears to have 
been an illegal operation, for they 
later contracted to pay me an an
nuity of the value of $45,000 on 
conditions that my suits for libel 
be discontinued. . ...
So I am drily .followingWn the 
footsteps ,of Dr. Butler,, and a long 
way behind, . in gently criticizing 
the press releases--of what the con
scientious 'shpwman called the 
biggest elephant .in, the world ex
cept itself.

Charting tomorrows telephone needs
Looking ahead  laying a firm founda
tion for tomorrows telephone service 
 has long been a keystone policy of 
the Bell System.
To illustrate: business starts creeping 
into a residential district  a sign that 
greatly increased telephone facilities will 
be required. Through intensive studies, 
commercial engineers forecast the needs
of five or more years hence with scien
tific accuracy. Additional 'exchanges, 
cable ducts, equipment of all kinds arc 
planned and built. When the call comes 
the telephone company is ready.
So long as the nation continues to 
change and grow, the plotting of its fu
ture telephone needs will never grow 
dull. The opportunity is there!
