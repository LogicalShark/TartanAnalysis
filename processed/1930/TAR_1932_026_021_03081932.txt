Captain Edgar G. Hamilton will 
be the speaker at the Student As
sembly in the Carnegie Union on

ever, the course in mining but 
transferred to the Industrial Edu
cation course.
The Captain showed an interest 
in student activities at school and 
held the position of managing -edi
tor of the Tartan. At the begin
ning of the World War, Captain 
Hamilton left school to- join the 
French Ambulance Service. He did 
not stay long in this service, for 
he shortly afterwards joined the 
Lafayette Escadrille of the French 
Flying Corps. It was in this unit

tinction of being the only Amer
ican officer with the Foreign- Le
gion, which is. the African unit of 
the French army, He is stationed 
with the Legion at the base in 
Morocco. No doubt few Carnegie

the last appearance of the boxing 
team * this year and. those in charge 
of the sport and the dance hope that 
the support given them will be as 
good as it has been in the past.
In order 'to' add to lie formal 
aspect of the match many fraterni
ties will hold formal dinners before 
the match at their respective houses. 
This custom, although new is. ex
pected to add greatly to the popular
ity of the sport.

and Mrs. A. E. Fisher, Dean Mary 
W. -Green, Glendinning Keeble, Mr.

Spring Fashions Predict Feathered
Hats and Pink Garters For Males
Empress Eugenie,, having placed 
ridiculous feathered hats on half 
the feminine population last fall, 
now turns her attention to men, 
commanding that they don hats of 
pastel shades fitted with tricky 
feathers. Whether the feathers will 
be of the perky chicken type or 
of the slinky plume type will de
pend on the tastes of the wearer. 
Besides the feathered hats, the 
mythical well-dressed man will 
wear pink garters and lavender ties 
on dazzling shirts glistening under 
creamy white suits. The crowning 
note of his invasion into the field 
of color will be polka dot, zippered underwear.
These are not mere idle specula
tions of a fanciful mind, but the 
decision of an association of re
tail clothiers in Chicago. They 
claim that men have worn sombre 
colors so long that their state or 
mind has been affected by it. And 
now Chicago ' will clothe its beer 
barons and cow kings in lovcljr 
pale shades. It will not be easy 
to learn "which of the campus no
tables will don the pink garters 
and polka dots. We might inspect 
wash lines on balmy Mondays, or 
have some sort Of understanding; 
with a sympathetic- laundry man.
While we hesitate to scorn the 
possibilities of these revealing 
fashions, we willingly forego theih 
in contemplation of dazzling shirts 
and pale feathered hats, the 
thoughts of which even strike ter
ror to our conservative soul.
Having thus vented our ill-nature 
it must be ill-nature which makes
us wratliy about mens harmless, 
even though idiotic fashionswe 
turned to see what Patou, Chanel 
and Worth have -designed for the 
worshippers at feminine shrines of 
fashions. In a very gay and 
sprighty manner, i we began to in
spect the pages of a fashion maga
zine, the kind which gives its read
ers advice on everything from cor
rect shoc-strfngs to suitable bridal 
attire. As we gazed upon the first 
page, the sprighty air turned to one 
of amazement, then to one of sor
row. There was displayed, as a 
particularly desirable material for 
the coming season, - a Cotton cloth 
known as "Searsucker, a crepcy 
substance out of which were made 
our childish underwear aiid nighties 
it was before the pajama era. 
We vehemently hated it, but our 
mothers reveled in it, because it 
didnt have to be ironed.
Somewhat subdued and a little 
apprehensive, we looked further, 
but found nothing to make us gay 
or hopeful. In 1932, Miladys 
dresses will swathe her as securely 
as a mummy, then in the most 
astonishing places, the}1- billow and 
swirl like an unfurling flag. Sleeves, 
instead of beginning respectable at 
shoulder seams, begin at ones neck 
or ones elbow; and those which 
do not fit like ones skin, are ruf
fled, tucked and gathered to enor
mous proportions. Hats grow less 
and less head shaped and we fear 
than they will*have to be anchored 
with hat pins or chin straps.
Each of these  noted details will

PUPPET OFFERED 
TIME ON WWSW
Already on the air once a week 
in a news broadcast by the Tartan, 
Carnegie Tech has been given the 
opportunity for an - additional pe
riod sponsored by the Puppet over

Thistle Staff Plans \ 
More Modern Year Book
The Thistle, this year, is 
being planned not only as a 
year book, but rather as a 
specimen of fine commercial 
printing. Every detail of 
workmanship is the highest 
that can be procured. The 
staff is endeavoring to make 
this years Thistle finer in 
every way.
The ornate treatment of 
most year-books has been dis
carded in favor of a modern, 
sophisticated treatment, with
out the usual trite material 
and manner. The color 
scheme is green and silver, 
employing two shades of the 
green. On both the front and 
back covers" will be a thistle, 
reproduced in green and oxi
dized silver. The word this
tle will not appear.
The price of the Thistle 
this year has been reduced to 
$4 for those who subscribe, 
and $4.50 for those who do 
not. The staff is .anxious to 
have as many as possible 
subscribe for the book, which 
will probably be ready for 
sale some tinje in May.
According to . Jacl^ Stone, 
Editor ''of' Carnegies year
book, the "Thistle, all write
ups for pictures to be. put 
in the book must be in the 
Y" office by next Friday, 
March 11. This week also is 
the last' week for group pic
tures since the photographer 
is leaving the school on Fri
day.

75Senior and' Sub-Senior 
Architects Sign 
Petition
FACULTY APPROVES
W. C. Holloway Appointed 
General Chairman 
of Festival
At a recent meeting of the Stu
dent Council a ruling" was passed 
to change the date of this years 
Spring Carnival which will be held 
from Thursday evening, May 19, 
to Saturday evening, May 21, in
stead of during the same period 
from May 12 to 14 as last year. 
This change has been approved by 
the Faculty Executive Board.
The movement for tjic changc in 
dates was the result of a petition 
submitted to the Student Council 
signed by some 75 senior and sub
senior architects. Because the 
originally planned dates fell during 
a scheduled charctte period for stu
dents who had not been able to 
attend a Spring Carnival since they 
came to Carnegie, they requested 
a changc. . There are no night 
school functions during the newly 
set dates as has been the case for 
the past few years.
The only interference which will 
arise during the newly set period, 
as reported to the Student Council, 
is a production by the Department 
of Drama in the Little Theater. 
Endeavors arc being made to re
arrange the track and tennis sched
ules so that meets in these sports 
will not conflict with the Spring 
Carnival period.
Willard C. Holloway, *32, has 
been appointed by Student Council 
as- general chairman of this year's 
festival. His aides have  not yet 
been named. Mr. Holloway is 
president of the senior class in the 
College of Engineering, a member 
of ' Sigma Nu social fraternity, 
Dragon, senior class honorary, and 
Scabbard and Blade, military hon
orary, and is student colonel of 
the Carnegie R. O. T. C. unit.
During the Carnival it has been , 
the custom to hold an elaborate 
coronation of the campus queen 
selected by popular vote. Arrange

Last -week the Carnegie Wom
ens team fired in competition with 
the following university teams: 
University of Maryland, University 
of Vermont, University of Wash
ington at Seattle, and University 
of South Dakota.
Sickness has depleted the ranks 
of the team somewhat, and there
fore the number of girls compet
ing for place on the team has been 
greatly decreased. The following 
scores were turned in by five of 
the seven girls who shot for place
ment for last week:
Voegtly_____________I_________ 08Brooks ________________________ 98
Roberts ._;____________________ 07Lowery_______________________OSSchmelz _______________________ 96
Team Score ______________ 485
This score is not up to the stan
dard that the Carnegie girls have 
maintained for the past few years, 
and every person interested in 
Rifle sincerely hopes that a better 
result is obtained during the re
mainder of the season.
Virginia Artz, who took part in 
the Womens Individual Intercol
legiate Match that was sponsored
The much deferred and discussed 
Carncgie-Pitt swimming meet has, 
at last, bccomc a reality. After 
countless delays and setbacks the 
contest - has finally been scheduled 
for Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 
in the Tartan'pool. The meet to
morrow" will mark the high spot 
of Pittsburghs collcgiatc swim
ming, as it. brings together two of 
the best aggregations in the East, 
both undefeated and both1 eager 
to rcmainjin that enviable state.
Considering the meet, either 
from a comparative score basis, or 
from the standpoint of individual 
performance, Carnegie will be, de
cidedly, the underdog. Pitt holds 
victories over many of Techs vic
tims, by much higher scores than 
were turned in by the Tartan team. 
In addition, the Panther swimmers 
have recorded lower times than the 
Carnegie splashers, in almost every 
event.
Despite this gloomy outlook, the 
Tartans arc certain to display that 
determination and fight that has 
thus for kept their record spotless, 
and the members can be counted 
upon to give their best until the 
last.  .
Pitt Very Strong
The Panther swimmer counted 
upon to give Tech the most trou
ble is Haiftia. This luminary swims 
both the 100 and the 440 free 
styles, and has a habit of winning 
both events. In the 50 yard free 
style, Addlesburg must be beaten 
ere Tech can register a first here. 
Pitt is comparatively weak in the 
backstroke but boasts of the 
Schmielcr brothers, champion 
breaststrokcrs, and Carrik, diver 
extraordinary. These are the stars, 
and others, whom the Tartans 
must overcome to gain the coveted 
victory over Pitt.
Plaid Defeats F.-M.
Friday afternoon, in what was 
undoubtedly the most exciting and 
hardest fought .meet of their sea
son,. the Carnegie natators took a 
well-earned . victory over Franklin 
and Marshall College. The score 
of this., thriller was 32 to 27 and 
the contest was not decided. until 
the last event.
To Pal Miller, Tartan spicdstcr, 
must go the hero laurels. Pal 
came through in Merriwell fashion 
with an all-important first' in the 
100 free style, the final race, to give 
Tech the meet. Miller also won 
the 0 free and swam anchor man 
on the victorious relay team. Ted 
Eastabrooke got back in the first 
place column in the F & M en
gagement by taking the fancy div
ing event, Thompson further griev
ed the visitors by winning the 
breaststroke, in commendable fash
ion. F & M took first and second 
in the 440 free style and Chalmers 
of the Lancastcritcs easily de
feated Boyer, in the backstroke.
Saturday night, Pitt broke three 
pool records while defeating Frank
lin and Marshall, 39 to 20. This 
meet should serve to furnish fur
ther comparison between the Skibo 
and Panther swimming teams.
The high powered Carnegie Tech 
Basketball team brings its season 
to a close this week after meeting 
two strong opponents. The Plaid 
squad journeys up to Beaver Falls 
tonight to encounter the fast Ge
neva outfit. Then on Friday night 
Penn State send its team to the 
Tartan Gym to play the Skibos 
in the closing contcst of the year.
Coach Hogan will not be able to 
let his boys coast through the last 
two games; in fact, lie will have 
to signal full speed ahead if lie 
expects the boys to come through 
with victories. The game with 
Geneva tonight will probably be 
one of the toughest of the year. 
Those boys from Beaver Falls 
know their basketball as the Tar
tans found out one night when 
Jimmy Leonard and his mates fell 
victims to their attack. Geneva 
has the advantage of playing on 
their own floor but that Plaid out
fit is going to be out there fighting 
to. attempt to keep their winning 
streak intact. In Aultman, Mont
gomery and Manning, Geneva has 
three of the strongest boys of the 
district and it will be up to Car
negie to stop them.
CloBe Season Friday
The finale with Penn State on 
Friday night should be a .thriller. 
ThoSe boys' from Stat College 
have one of their best quintets in 
years and they have a very fine 
record for this season. Last year, 
Penn State with one of their poor
est teams in recent times, forced 
Carnegie to the utmost and it was 
only by a last minute rally that 
the Tartans were able to eke out 
a onc-point victory. If this is any 
indication of what the contcst will 
be like Friday night, it will cer
tainly be well worth seeing.
Tartans Down Dukes
The basketball team extended its 
winning streak to six straight when 
they downed West Virginia- 011 
Tuesday' night and Duquesne on 
Friday night. The score of the 
West Virginia contcst was 45-31 
and those boys from Morgantown 
never,had a chance. The big vic
tory of the season came on Fri
day night when the Tartans downed Duquesne 29-24. Duquesne, who 
had previously defeated the Plaid 
when Tech was in a slump, and 
who were conceded to be flic class 
of tho district, fell before the 
clover playing of Carnegie in the 
Tartan gym.
The first half was a nip and tuck 
affair, with neither team being more 
than two points ahead. At half 
time tho Scotch were out in front 
by the scoro of 12-11. After this 
point, Duquesne was never ahead 
and at times were behind by seven, 
points. Carnegies second half at
tack was so fast and deceptive 
that Duquesne was continually on 
the defense. All in all it was a 
very cxciting game, but the Plaid 
outplayed their rivals and deserved 
the well earned victory.
THIS Ii>EA OF REVENGE sccmbd to perme-M
ate the campus activities in the sport world last 
week. The 29 to 24 victory over Duquesne 
heads the list, and somehow were inclined to 
feel that we have the last-go-swap on the 
Dukes, since they were successful in their first 
) attempt..
The second win of the week was that more 
decisive decision over the erstwhile Mountain
eers who won from the Skibos earlier in the 
season. These results even accounts with two 
questionable opponents, and it is very likely that Geneva will 
pay the penalty of their former three-point win when Captain 
Leonard and his gang oppose the Covenanters on their home 
floor tonight.
Coach Risedorphs swimming team supported the weeks 
winnings with their hard fought victory over Franklin-Marshali. Their 32 to 27 margin was reached only after Pal Miller 
dashed off a fast 100 yards in the final race.* * * * *
EVERYTHING POINTS TOWARD another good game 
in the gym this Friday night with Penn State. The Panthers 
meager four-point win over the Lions will give the Staters that 
small bit of confidence whicji may crop out in Friday's contest. 
f.But if the Plaid quintet can keep up that onslaught that down
ed the Dukes, Coach Iiogan Will cjose the season with twoithirds of his. games won.
However, Lou Jagnow^ knee injury has taken the form of 
that dark person in the lumber pile for it is very improbable 
that this stellar forward will appear in the lineup again this 
season.*****
SOMEBODYS CLEAN RECORD is bound to be blemish^ 
cd tomorrow afternoon when the Pitt and Carnegie tank men 
gather in the Tartan pool for tjieir annual meeting. Although 
the odds are as much in favor of the Plaid team as has ever 
been experienced, the Panther natators should manage to scrape 
through with a bare margin of success. No matter what the 
results may be the Skibos have enjoyed the most profitable 
season so far. ******
A FULL TEAM bF PLAID BOXERS is cxpccted to put 
in an appearance against Pitt this Saturday evening. The place 
of meeting will be announced sometime this week. The Pan
thers weak victory over West Virginia presents the only com
parative inkling that could give Coach Scstos battlers more 
than half a chance to win.
Jerry OToole and Bert Pouncey, Plaid football players, 
liave joined the squad, and, with the aid of Fraser Hcllcgers, 
who has returned to good standing, will fill the gaps in the 
Skibo lineup. Atlas boils arc expected to be out of the way 
by Saturday, and the three regulars, Waldron, Carr, and Wertz, 
are due for a creditable performance.* * * *  *
INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL LEADERS arc simmer
ing down to a few select teams, and within another week more 
definite dope on the winners of each league will be available. 
The closest: race has been provided by the National League 
where the D. U.s. can produce a thrcc-corncrcd tic between 
themselves, the Alpha Sigs, and the Senior Architects by de
feating the latter in their game Wednesday night.
The winners of the Federal League will be decided in the 
game a week from tonight between the Pi K. As and the Kap
pa Sig's. Both of these teams have defeated their league op
ponents with more or less regularity.
Englebrcchtn team,, representing the wandering spirit of 
last years Wclch Hall, has sewed the American League first 
place up for themselves with five straight wins and two easy 
games to be played. The final play-off of the league winners 
is scheduled to take place before the Easter recess.* *' * * *
INTRAMURAL ATHLETIC REPRESENTATIVES will 
meet this afternoon at 4 ;30 in the Trophy Room for a discus
sion on the soft ball competition which will begin during the 
first week in April. This sport created a powerful lot of inter
est during its first season of activity last spring.
JfM . Guntsp1
With Jim Fergus in the lineup Coach Buzz Hogan is assured that the largest half of his, defense problem is solved. Jim has earned this reputation by his consistant work in disrupting the opponents offense. Fergus never fails to join in a scoring rally, and when everything is apparently blocked up he comes through with his timely dribble to the basket for two more points.Fergus was the unanimous choice for All-Western Pennsylvania guard last year, and has just been named on the All-District team for the present season. The fair-haired Angus, his more personal name plate, has one more year to play for the Skibos.
Alumnae Invited To 
Womens Jr. PromAlumni Urged To 
Pay Dues For Year
The -women of the class of 
32 extend a cordial invitation 
to alumnae to attend the

Penn Hotel on March 18. 
The price has been reduced 
to $.5. Kay Kaysers popular 
radio and recording orchestra

Prom may secure tickets 
cither from members of the 
Prom Committee or through 
the Alumni Association.
Members of Carnegie Alum

four dollars. However, a new 
system is being initiated, by 
which the alumni may pay 
only two dollars for the re

PLEBES END SEASON 
WITH PENN STATEIntramural Wrestling competition ' 
is scheduled to begin April 4, soon 
after Easter vacation, and will last 
for two or three weeks.
Mr. Riscdorpli and Mr. Rintclcn 
have been working on Intramural 
Wrestling for spmc time. They 
are expecting to make the meet an 
annual affair and feel confident 
that it will hold an increasingly 
large place on Carnegies , sport 
program.
Negotiations for suitable awards 
arc now being made. These awards 
will probably consist ' of a rotating 
cup for the winning organization 
and medals for individual con
testants.
Each group entering the com
petition will be represented by 
four or five men instead of the 
usual eight-man team. However,
there will be open for entries eight 
classes, as follows: 115 pounds, 125 
pounds, 135 pounds, 145 pounds, 155 
pounds, 165 pounds, 175 pounds, 
and unlimited weight class.
All those who intend to enter 
the meet must see Mr. Riscdorpli
for registration some time before 
Easter vacation begins.
Notice is given that any en
trants who may desire to do so 
may practice at any time in the 
apparatus room. Mr. Rintclcn will 
be there in the capacity of coach 
on Tuesday and Thursday after
noons at 4:30.
Men who are not nicmbers of 
any fraternity or. do not live in 
one of the dormitories are also 
eligible to enter a squad in the 
tournament.
The Plcbe Basketers set out 
this week armed to clash with the 
Geneva Reserves at Beaver Falls to
night and then to close the season 
with Penn State here Friday night. 
This will be a preliminary game to 
the varsitys clash with the Lion var
sity.
The strong Geneva Reserves will 
not have an easy time with the Stub
born Skibo yearlings. Both teams 
anticipate a hard game.
The Penn State Freshmen arc sure 
to put up a good fight,, but if the 
Carnegie first year men snap out of 
their slump, a real exhibition is 
guaranteed.
The.; Plebes were beaten twice last 
week. The West Virginia Frosh 
triumphed. 30-24, and the Duquesne 
Freshmen came out on top at 45-17. 
The little Mountaineers led most of 
the way in last Tuesdays tilt, but 
were hardprcssed by the Plaid fresh
men throughout the game. Carlson 
and Stydhcr were the mainstays for 
their respective teams.
Ragged play on -the part of the 
Plebes and equally flashy a perform
ance' on the part of the Duquesne 
freshmen characterized their fray 
last Friday night. The Duklcts did 
some spectacular shooting that ma
terialized to a great extent during 
the first half.
Navy Wins Close Match;
Sherba Shoots Best Score
The long winning streak of the 
strong Carnegie rifle team was 
brought to an end by the Navy 
at Annapolis Saturday, 1401 to 1377. 
This marks the final shoulder-toshoulder meet o the year for the 
Skibo shots.
Scherba, Tartan ace, led both 
teams in scoring with an excep
tional 287 out of a possible 300. 
Shooting was done from prone, 
kneeling and standing positions.
This was the closest call the 
Navy has had this year, the Mid
dies having beaten West Virginia 
and George Washington by dccisivc scorcs.
This has been one of the most 
successful rifle seasons in many 
years for the Plaid marksmen. In
cluded among their victims have 
been West Virginia, Penn State 
and Pitt. \

Talking about the moon is a very 
appropriate topic for the night

Moon, in last weeks issue of the

the old notions about the moon

if I did have some green cheese

yellow, just so it was cheese). Bet 
the girls in the Arts are jealous 
about Lady Moon and her pumice

Well, the country is now in the 
midst of celebrating the bicenten
nial' anniversary of the birth of 
that illustrious father of our coun
try  George Washington. Two 
hundred years certainly is a long 
time to look back upon. Why, 
that is a longer time than our 
country is old, but then Washing
ton had to be borri in order to 
make the United States possible. 
iThere are quite a number of dis
plays all over the city _ showing 
relics, mementoes, souvenirs, keep
sakes and whatnots about Wash
ington and his times. I wonder 
how much of a display is shown 
at the Carnegie Institute during 
this celebration? This is an ideal 
place to have a real exhibit, a cen
tral place in which to show the 
memorials. None are better equip
ped for display purposes and, as it 
is a civic center controlled by the 
city, the Institute should assume a 
commanding position. I am going 
over there the very first opportu
nity to view what they have to of
fer as I have seen the ones on dis
play downtown.
* * * *. *
I see they are endeavoring to 
{eliminate the lame ducks down at 
[Washington. That is about the 
best thing that could happen to 
ithe country. Think of waiting 
mAntks and months before the new 
legislative body can get into ac
tion. We have certainly outgrown 
the antiquated ideas which prevail
ed' at 'the time those early-Con
gresses convened. It will be in
teresting to see which state will 
ratify the change first. And while 
they are at it, it -wbiild be another 
good idea to take up that old 
thorn in the side, Prohibition. One 
' gets sick and tired of seeing that 
pot-boiling, pan-handling activity 
bootleggingwith all the side is
sues, which arc flourishing all over 
the country. It is about time the 
country which Washington helped 
to make,.possible would cease to be 
the - laughing stock of the world 
and get down to business. Even 
Washington wouldnt tolerate such 
a condition. He had a well stock
ed wine cellar. It' was no dis
grace in those days, so why should 
it be one now. Prohibitionmight: 
as well admit there aint no such 
'word.*****
No, Im not kicking, but I am 
glad some other night student 
voiced his opinion about closing 
the Hut during the interval_ of 
second semester registration time 
for the day students. As I view 
the situation, the hut is there to 
serve all students and it does seem 
illogical to close the edifice to a 
group of students who come out 
nightly for classes and possible re
search. If there is use for ft one 
time surely' there is use for it at 
another time. Maybe next year a 
new schedule will be arranged so 
that the Hut will remain open 
during the whole night term period. 
We shall see.
THAT a day student travels 
700 miles a week to school, an
other champion, but try work
ing all day and then travel 450 
miles weekly to school, yep, our 
night champion is still Icing.
THAT the night engineers arc 
subsituting a dance for their 
usual smoker, another Arts school, 
idea plaguarizcd.
THAT the Plaid is looking for 
news contributions from students, 
lets give them some, whats say.
THAT the sheep skins will be 
smaller this year,, what difference 
does it make, people usually keep 
them in the attic anyway.
THAT Dad Manson and 
"Foam-blowcr Fritz have been 
getting as much publicity as a 
Ziegfield Hot-Cha star.
THAT the ."i'll be secnya 
habit is gripping the campus, as 
usual were always starting some
thing.
THAT thats that and Ill be 
scenya!

Associated Artists 
Exhibition Attracts 
a Night Student
The, Associated Artists Exhibition 
now running at the Carnegie Insti
tute Galleries, acquaints us with the 
superior caliber of local talent, and 
provides the prime test of ones 
capacity for esthetical pleasures. I 
have just come from there and can 
vouch for the truth of the aformentionod facts.
We need have no fear of associat
ing with the associated artists, be
cause they arc apparently inoculated 
against the ravages, of Fauvism and 
the other isms; even the prize 
winners lack the earmarks of genius, 
which is the modernist definition for 
extreme insanity.
There is not a single paipting 
after the manner of Picasso, Duffy 
or De Sagonzac, and if a slight 
tendency toward the modern is evi
dent, it is really praiseworthy and 
wholly unobjectionable.
Upon entering, the first picture to 
attract my attention is the winner 
of first honor Mexican Market at 
Night by Richard Crist. To me it 
is a colorful night scene faithfully 
done in subdued tones that give an 
aspect of reality; perhaps its con
venient size suggests that the artist 
originally intended it for his own 
home. As I look around The Blue 
Costume by- Louise Pershing re
veals deftness of brush by her treat
ment of a gypsy girl in picturesque 
raiment. Haunted House by Pattison is a painting in green mono
chrome of an old vacant house 
veiled in mystery, so delightfully 
reminiscent of early childhood thrills.
To try and take in everything at 
a glance in this fascinating gallery 
as I am trying to do for writing 
purposes, is as useless as a humble 
night students effort to acquire a 
complete art education in four years. 
How. can one pass up Mr. Simbolis 
commendable Still Life without 
speaking of its excellent composition 
and color-harmony, or Mr. Vogels 
Old Books without commenting on 
the fundamental tone that makes 
those inanimate objects so appealing?
Also in this same gallery is Re
pose" a solid nude by William Shulgold, and it is typical of lys numer
ous works in this exhibition. Al
though all of his portraits and ntidcg, 
regardless of the medium used, pos
sess a certain charm, they reveal a 
technique that covers his subjects 
with a pale dusky skin like that of 
a mulatto.
Moving slowly into the main gal 
lcry, I stopped for a moment to 
study with half- closed eyes, the 
allegory in Cereus a large canvas 
by Mrs. Pershing. I marvel at the 
scope of her talent and active im
agination. Similarly Grape Pickers 
by Mildred Schmertz attracts me 
with its intense but charming colors.
I find to my delight that the 
faculty of Carnegie Tech Arts 
School is well represented here, 
There is Mr. Hydes comprehensive 
Fantasie en moir dore. Notice the 
swirling movement of its strong 
governing lines, and its few but 
forceful tones. "Stormy Afternoon 
by Mr. Rcadio is a splendid land
scape, and Mr. Dowdens American 
Scene" is characteristic of his inter
esting type. Mr. Rosenberg has a 
remarkable, work called November 
Pittsburgh" and it seems to have 
many admirers.
Some artists have - the ability to 
beautify their models; after viewing 
Nude" and "Young Woman" by Mr. 
MacGilvary, Im sure every .one will 
agree that he has that gift. E.
The smoker scheduled by the Night 
College of Engineering to be held 
on March 19, 1932 as listed in the 
Night Social Calendar on page eleven 
of the Night Student Carnegie Hand
book, has been cancelled, and in 
place of this activity, the officers 
of that college have substituted a 
dancc and card party. This changc 
has been made with the idda that 
more interest will be shown in the 
activity than if a smoker were held. 
The attendance at the smokers spon
sored by the Night College of Engi
neering has been small, and the dancc 
and card party should be a means 
of stimulating more interest in the 
activities of this college.
Thistle Hall will be the scene of 
the function and it will be' the first 
time the hall is used by the Night 
College of Engineering for any of its 
activities.
Various committees have been ap
pointed to make arrangements for 
the party so that the students regis
tered in this college will be able to 
enjoy a pleasant evening and get 
away, ffom the usual grind of study. 
Mark this change and plan to at
tend the affair.

The night group pictures of the 
three night colleges for the 1932 
Thistle will be taken during this 
week. All these pictures will be taken 
in the Union. A schedule has been 
arranged and will be announced in 
the class rooms. The various groups 
arc requested to report at the time 
specified so that there will be no con
fusion, and everyone taken care of. 
The Union is loeated 011 the third

All night students who expect  to 
finish their courses this year are re
quested to send in their names im
mediately to. the Night Thistle Staff, 
Box 137, C. I. T., giving the course 
they are registered in. The Night 
Thistle Staff hopes to have a com
plete history of the night group in 
its section and are expecting the 
night student body, particularly those 
students who expect to finish their 
courses, to co-operate with them in 
making it so.
CLANS HOLD MEETINGS
THROUGHOUT COUNTRY
There will be 14 meetings of C. I. T. alumni this year on Clan Day, which will be next Saturday, March 12. At the time messages from Dr. Baker and from the president of the alumni association will be read. The groups will range in number from 10 to 75. The alumni office is planning to send out copies of the Tartan to the secretaries of all clans to be distributed to those attending, the Clan Day gatherings.
The Alumni office inaugurated this plan of having all Carnegie Tech Clans arrange meetings to be. held simultaneously two years ago. The idea met with such enth.usiasm that Clan Day has become an established event on the alumni calendar. It is the one day of the year when we endeavor to have Carnegie Tech men and women in all parts of the country meet and the groups seem to feel that these annual C. I. T. day is very worth while.

THE DECLINE OF
STUDENT THOUGHT
RETREATING
It is interesting to contrast the uni
versities and colleges of today with 
similar institutions of the past. Aside 
from the growth of the curriculum 
where a few subjects were taught 
to the most rigorously planned course, 
there is also the question of the 
growth or decline of student thought. 
We find that the old universities in 
Greece1 were nothing more than a 
handful of men of all ages who 
gathered at ccrtain places in order 
to discuss the problems of the day.
All these men' were interested 11 
life and what was going on about 
them. There was 110 limit to what 
they could discuss or how they were 
to discuss it. Anyone who had any 
opinion on a subject had a perfect 
right to present it to the rest of the 
group.
As centuries went by things 
changed. More and more knowledge 
was being gathered together and it 
was necessary to teach the students 
this knowledge. There still persisted 
the practice of free discussion. At 
the present time the courses offered 
by colleges and universities lead to 
a degree and it is necessary to fol
low rigoriously the prescribed sched
ule of studies. What has become of 
free discussion? It seems as if the 
acquisition of a mass of facts is 
more valuable to a person than the 
ability to properly discriminate be
tween right and wrong, and good 
and bad. It is true that debating 
clubs still prevail. The few students 
participating in this activity, how
ever, together with the almost total 
lack of interest shown by others, 
makes this form of free discussion 
almost worthless.
Recently, the editor of a college 
newspaper was suspended from that 
office because he frankly and freely 
expressed his views on the subject 
of our present day marriages. Grant
ing that the subject was a delicate 
one, it appears that it is not de
sirable that existing evils bp brought 
to light. The prevailing tendency 
seems to be to hide the sore until 
it becomes inflamed. Would that 
same editor have been treated in this 
manner back in the days of the 
early Greeks, or would he have been 
listened to with attentiorl and re
spect as one having something vital 
to say?
The policy of some schools of the 
present time is to have an official 
of the school act. as a censor and 
anything which, is said or done that 
is not in accordance with the views 
of those who control the school is 
thrown out. Is this the freedom of 
thought which our constitution is 
supposed to have provided for us? 
Is this the freedom upon which the 
very ideas of the university was 
founded and which should be its 
guiding spirit? It appears that one 
group of students learn one thing 
and arc taught that everything else 
is wrong, then again another group 
is taught the reverse. This should 
not beall questions should be dis
cussed from a liberal, unbiased point 
of view. Perhaps Plato, Aristotle 
and many of the other old Greeks 
were not accurate in the facts they 
advanced as we sec them, but they 
at least made no attempt to teach 
their students that only the point of 
view propounded by them was right 
while all the others were wrong.

In a monograph rcccntly pub
lished- by a printing house in Lon
don there appeared the philosophic 
and scientific views of four of the 
leading scientists of the world. The 
views expressed on modern ad
vances in physics, religion, philo
sophical views of the universe and 
some history of physics and rclig* 
ion.
The first to express himself was 
Eddington, famed English scientist 
and astronomer. Eddington has 
collaborated with other famous 
continental scientists iii forming 
some of the theories advanced by 
Einstein. The main question that 
Eddington discussed was his per
sonal views of the universe and 
the existence of a God. Page after 
page of words were set down, 
and in summing all of them up no 
one could find 'any coherence. It 
seems that Eddington in his anx
iety to appease the demands of 
the churches in England has at
tempted to express his belief in a 
God and has done so by couching 
his profession in a scientific vein, 
which only succeeded in keeping 
his true thoughts from his inquisi
tors. Alas! poor churchmen. How 
were they to know that a man 
would claim that there is a God 
and yet put his claims in words 
that were directly opposite in 
meaning?
Then Huxlcjr, another famous 
English biologist and scientist, glad
dened the hearts of the people by 
admitting his belief in God. He, 
too, went through a long brainwearying process to prove his con
tention only to emerge smilingly 
with the knowledge that no one 
knew rightly what his idea on the 
subject really was.
After these two brilliant dis
sertations on nonsense, Sir James 
Jeans waded into the argument. 
Jeans had his back up against the 
wall. He feared to openly avow 
his atheistic principles and in or
der to set everyones mind at case, 
lie explained his idea of a mathe
matical God. This seemed to sat
isfy. Is it not better to have a 
mathematical God than 110 God at 
all? Both Jeans and Huxley were 
a storm. Both had in their lec
tures in their respective universi
ties stated their disbelief in a God. 
Yet, when called upon .in public, 
they sought to retreat from their 
former position.
The book ends with Einstein, 
the mathematician and philosopher. 
It is lie who committed the ex
treme heresy of setting forth the 
theory of relativity. Like Coper
nicus, lie is being condemned and 
110 doubt like Copernicus lie will 
be eulogized by some future gen
eration. Ah, ycsl he has a God. 
He believes in the God of Spinoza. 
Those of you who have an ele
mentary idea of Spinozas philoso
phy know that his God was no 
god at all. Still it suffices when 
one says that he possesses a god 
when his words plainly speak oth
erwise.
Throughout the book the editor 
of the monograph constantly flays 
the expressed beliefs of the first 
three men mentioned. It is unfor
tunate that great men of science 
cannot speak forth boldly, but 
must answer yes to a question they 
mean no, and1 then turn around 
and write at considerable length 
to show that they arc sincere all 
the while giving adequate proof 
that they really mean otherwise. 
Are- men of science retreating? 
Arc they still firm in their beliefs 
and only take this method of hood
winking the people in order to 
save themselves from popular con
demnation?

The annual meeting of Nu Sigma

Saturday evening, March 12, 1932, 
in the Carnegie Inn. The meeting will 
be preceded by a dinner, which will 
be served at 6:30 p. 111. Reservations 
arc now being received for the din

Arrangements will be made at this 
meeting for the honorarys annual 
spring dance which will take place 
in April. Other activities to rcccivc 
consideration will be the annual picnic 
and corn roast, sponsored by the 
fraternity.
Is this an
IDEA?
Many college people have told yG that, 
with the "repression what it is, they 
feel they muet economize this sum
mer and that they are going to Europe 
to do so. Now, that may not sound 
like economy, but it is.
Remember, American dollars are big

living costs abroad are almost incred

Educating the Engineer
Recently Tau Beta Pi, the scholastic engineers honor
ary, held a meeting to which it invited the heads of all de
partments in the engineering school. The gathering, the 
lirst of its kind sponsored by the society, was tor the pur
pose of presenting, in an open forum, the opinions of the 
students and faculty on the problems coincident with the 
scholastic education of engineering students. Some inter
esting and valuable ideas blossomed from this group and 
shall be reviewed here.Students Opinion oi the Engineers Curriculum 
All expression of the opinions common to most stu
dents taking the four years of engineering at Carnegie was 
delivered in somewhat outline form by a. student. Quoting 
from this address:"The undergraduate schedule, in the opinions of 
many, has two major ills; the student has not enough 
time for work other than his classroom preparation, 
wherein to care for his physical and cultural educa
tion; the other is that, the desire of the student, for 
studies giving him a more-rounded background, can
not be met due to overcrowded schedules.^
An alternative suggestion, which is on trial in some 
schools and under discussion in most others, is the five 
and six year engineering course outline. A live year 
course would perhaps add a few extra subjects and 
lighten schedules somewhat but would hardly accom
plish its purpose. By going into a six year course 
many possibilities present themselves. One in particu
lar is the plan whereby three years of cultural train
ing arc taken at the start, and then arc followed by 
the three years of mainly technical work.
"The desire for a more general experience upon 
graduation is quite natural. Our work n6w fits us 
more for jobs as technicians, than for positions requir
ing a greater wealth of information than the knowledge 
of formulas. The problem of expense has so far kept 
the proposals for longer courses from being at all suc
cessful. A suggested plan to make it easier for gradu
ates of four year courses to return to school of their 
own volition, is the elimination of the expense of tui
tion ..............Technical or General Training First?
The suggestion was made for, splitting the engineers 
course into parts such as liberal arts training followed by 
the professional school work, as in the case, of law and 
medicine at present. The freshman in college is often 
times mainly interested in getting the technical training by 
which he believes his salary wild be measured. His appe
tite for the general subjects is much greater in his junior 
and senior years, and by graduation he usually realizes the 
need for further study. Perhaps if he were given three 
years :of his major course first, and then made to follow 
liberal arts work the benefits personally woyld be much 
greater. Commenting on this last prop<?sal Professor Trinks 
says:
We had some experience with night students when 
we had the old five year diploma course. The plan of 
giving general studies in the. last two years of the di
ploma course was rejected by the men themselves. The 
typical attitude was expressed by one man who came to 
us and said: The last course we. get is psychology on 
how to study.
However, there is a possibility that summer school 
classes in the general studies could be given those stu
dents really desiring, the training. In this manner the 
present schedule could be lightened somewhat.
In favor of the plan for general training before coming, 
to technical schools Dr. Janies declared:
We are. trying to give boys an education and a pro
fession in four years and it cant be done. We are try
ing t.o put six gallons in four gallon containers. Engi
neering should be put on the same plane as other pro
fessions with degree holders only as its student body. 
Trying to give too much in a limited time results in 
very poor compromise.
Graduate WorkWhen Should It Be Taken? 
Graduate work is definitely a benefit to the individual 
when measured in the terms of incomes over a life span. 
Averages compiled from various sources generally indicate 
that the advanced degree holders do have an advantage 
on the basis of financial returns. The chief difficulty lies 
in the fact that students on graduation are more concerned 
with ready returns on their four year investment and gen
erally accept jobs as soon as possible. 
The additional consideration as to when is the best 
time for graduate work, brings up the question whether or 
not a student should secure several years practical experi
ence before attempting to select a field for advanced study. 
Commenting on this problem Professor McCullough says: 
I feel very strongly that graduate work is of value 
and that it will be of increasing benefit as time goes 
011 and the number of college men increases. Men will 
need more specialized training. However, in general, I 
advise our graduates, even the most able men, to ge't a
FROM THE FENCE
What a Time!
The 1932 Intcrfraternity Ball has gone down into history as a huge success. Couldnt have been nicer. In the first place, very nice program-favors. Then a grand band that played marathons. I-Iow they could swing from one piece into another! Don Bigelow, quite the sophistocated maestro Buzz Kountz had his hands full with part of Hot- Cha so didn't bother leading the band. Didja notice the fire-extinguisher locatc_d under the piano? They nearly had use for it during the rendition of "Ill Be Glad and several other terribly torrid tempos. One could easily imagine the instruments bcco m ing red hot and the hall filling with smoke. Several Dramats entertained with a few rounds of Ring Around a Rosey and Folk Dancing. Toots Bailey and Dotybribed the editor to keep us from saying anything about his torrid dancc steps. So we cant tell you about them keeping a hole in the sky. The basketball team was well represented in spite of having just had a stiff workout in taking the Dukes. Sig Holvcrstott managed to reap some ferns from the band stand. Fortunately no attempt to run off a Grande Marche. ICinlcy seems to be slowing down (on the dancc floor at least). There were five minor revolving door casualties during the course of the evening. What an improvement the indirect lighting effect with the lighted crystal chandeliers. As a grand finale a most ungodly press at the checking room. And so to bed. .Oh. yeah! . .* * * *
Odds and Ends
After these' many long years the 8:29 short-cut to Engineering Hall has been paved, thus cutting the time to a class in that hall by one minute and thirteen seconds. . . . The Laurel lasses had a baby to play with last week. They did their daily good deed by sheltering a mop-like canine from the rigors of the belated winter weather. . . . Supcr- schnozzle Jalonack claims to be able to put out a column much superior to our humble efforts. Go ahead, were not afraid of competition. No plumbers type humor tho, please. . . . Professor Mike 
Schonvizner's wife made her first visit home after a mere half dozen moons of married life. The average is a much longer time than that. . . .
Scraps
Following the example of the Physics Department the Hydraulics-MechanicsSurveying office has installed a ping pong outfit for the benefit of the brighties who manage to finish their experiments early. . . . Miss Veneer Chessj new Carnegie recruit from Wilson College, unfortunately misinterpreted some well-meaning -publicity last week. We hate for anything so rare to go to waste. .. The Phi Kaps failed to tune in their radio one night when they got some free publicity over the Tech broadcast. They have a man stationed at the set all the time now. ... Room 6, Mellon Hall, craves publicity but theyll have to create a scdjic or something before we can accommodatc
them. ... Red Jones just dotes on children. Didja sec him at W. Va. game? A great poppa liell make. . . .* . * * *
Coming Attractions
Winter perhaps. Several days ago a number of robins decided that there wasnt going to be any winter so returned North. What will poor robin do now? There was Prexy Dana doing a 440-dash after a hat riding high on the March wind. Perhaps the outstanding local collegiate dance.of the year will be the Pitt Military Ball with Emerson Gill and Henry Busse in ,the 17th floor of the pill Penn. The list of patrons includes the officers of the Carnegie Scabbard and Blade. Gov.- Pinchot is also 011 the list. . . . The boxing team promises- not to disappoint this week so well don formal clothes again next Saturday in order to., get in. those coveted ringside seats. Several. fraternities are having formal dinners before the bout-. Just a year ago the school gingerly attempted an informal dance following a'boxing bout and now look what we have! . . . Then on April Fools Day is the Intcrfraternity Sing contcst. Formal dress and six minutes for each team to execute their song and dancc. There arc to be five disinterested faculty members as judges. Can they find that many disinterested judges? . . .* * * *
Congratulations
To the Drama Department on the success of "Hobsons Choice. A fine play done in top notch style. Particular bouquets'to Miss Drake for her performance. . . Cheers also for the basketball team for the practically continuous fine showing they have made. Best of luck for the few remaining contests. ....

CLUB NOTES
China and Japans Peculiar Struggle
HB Fsc rmNySi B. Ross
The Japanese went to Shanghai, 
"Thoroughly imbued with high moral 
purposes, to maintain peace etc., says 
Major Hirala.
This gives us our pictttrc of the 
noble Nipponese landing at Shanghai 
filled -to the , eyes with international 
virtue. But before a day passes the 
Japanese major makes a fearful dis
covery; the Chinese are unethical. 
He reports to the New York Times 
correspondent that Like' your Chi
cago Gangsters, Chinese snipers are 
paid so much a head. Heaven for
bid I It smacks of professionalism. 
Who coi|ld have fore-seen such 
depravity?
.indeed with 400,000,000 Chinese as 
compared with only 64,000,000 Japan
ese no fair minded person could 
expect the Japanese to compete 011 
a straight piece rate basis. The year
ly deficit of several hundred mil
lions in the Japanese budget puls 
them at a sufficiently great disad-r 
vantage. With the firing of each 
cartridge the Japanese approach that 
much nearer bankruptcy and the 
Chinese So much nearer victory. If 
the Japanese cannot restrain their ex
travagant impulse toward shooting 
Chinese they may go home badly de
feated.
There may be an undiscovered rela
tion between head hunting in Chi
cago and traffic, for the innocent 
Japanese in an effort to meet the un-. 
expected danger from snipers propose 
a safety zone.. If a hit made in the
safety zone, does not count, the 
chagrin of the Chinese sniper who 
makes a futile bullseye will only be 
surpassed by the satisfaction of the 
wily Jap that misleads his enemy into firing.
Now we have our wrong impres
sions corrected. The Japanese came 
to Shanghai to establish a safety 
zone whereas we had believed they 
came, to establish a war 'zone. That 
illustrates the ease with which in
ternational misunderstandings arise.
 On top of this we learn from 
Japanese sources that the Chinese 
wantonly and wilfully caused the 
destruction of Cliapei when the Jap
anese were doing there best to save 
the Chinese city. In other words the 
Chinese are the most difficult people, 
to help and protect. They delight in 
double crossirig themselves.
Let us put aside for a moment 
these hypocritical and absurd pieties 
which slightly anesthetize the pain of 
blood letting among the masses and 
arouse disgust.' among the discern
ing, but .which in 110 case conceal 
the shameful fact that although hu
man beings have discovered fire, 
control of conception, the x-ray and 
the radio, and although they can pro
tect themselves against destruction by 
armies of microbes, they cannot pro
tect themselves against destruction by 
each other.
Faced by a world of danger and 
deception in which more than one in
ternationalist of Wilsonian stature has 
been hood-winked by the Clemenceaus
few years experience in order to crystalize their views. 
After that experience they choose more wisely in pick
ing graduate work.
I believe if the college man is rated as a man of 
promise by his employers he will be permitted to re
turn to school' after several years and devote his time 
towards additional training. It is true that in this case 
the program for his graduate work will be narrowed 
to technical fields.
Concerning Graduate School Expenses 
The proposal for granting free tuition to those men who 
have completed four years at a college and -wish to take ad
vanced work is being considered by a number of schools 
throughout the 'country. A few have granted their gradu
ates a rebate on tuition as a measure to keep their men 
occupied during the depression. Director Mott when ques
tioned on this plan replied:
Such a plan would be of value up to a certain point. 
To say to all graduates, You may come back and enter 
our graduate school, seems to be of doubtful benefit. 
Giving the faculty the right to decide whether the man 
in question merits the additional study would make the 
plan rational. Some men are better off when they en
ter business at once on graduation.
Certainly there is a number of every class that are 
restricted from graduate work solely on a basis of fi
nances, but how are you going to pay the bill? This 
school has an income that covers but one half of its 
operating expenses. The other half conies from student 
fees. Should the school receive funds to establish a 
proper graduate school, with provision for . granting 
free tuition, there would .be 110 reason for not adopt
ing the proposal.
Thus it may be seen that modern educators are con
stantly meeting problems in their complex mass production 
of college graduates. Excellent theories may be evolved 
but applied only after the practical considerations are met. 
Carnegie is not in any serious plight, on -the contrary her 
condition is better than most of her contemporaries. * Still 
discussions such as these where the students and faculty 
meet Jtor mutual exchange of ideas are of great value to 
the school, as well as the individuals concerned, and per
haps will point the way for future developments. K.
arid Lloyd Georges of. hardened civil
izations, what' should be the Arnercan policy in the present crisis?
We should evacuate United States 
citizens, soldiers, and battleships from 
the entire Shanghai area for two 
rcasbhsfirst such a coursc would 
preclude a conflict and would be less 
expensive than war. Second it would 
allow us to remain on friend^ terms 
with Japan and at the same time 
give her' a better chance to commit; 
economic hara-kiri.
If our government feels bound to 
guarantee American investors- against 
loss when they gamble 011 political 
stability in a notoriously disorganized 
country such-, as China, let' us pay 
the Texaco Oil Comfriiny, arid other 
concerns for their property losses al
though there is no more reason for 
doing so . than thdrc is ; for the 
'government to guarantee the investor 
in tlie stock market against loss.
Our non-interference with the Jap
anese program ' will allow them to 
continue an expensive and disastrous 
policy. The perspicacious Trotsky 
predicts that China will become 
Japans Morocco . and there is much 
to support his view's. The deficit in 
the Japancs budget in recent peace
ful years amounted to more than 
250,000,000 dollars annually, or- more 
than a quarter of the . total national 
expenditures.
In case of continued hostilities 
Japan will be compelled to finance 
herself by borrowing, but she cannot 
expect help from Great Britain, the 
United States or Germany. France 
the only remaining country capable 
of lending financial support appears 
to be in secret harmony with Japanese 
policy in an effort to establish an in
fluence embarrassing to us in the 
East which could at the opportune 
inoment be revealed and used to 
bargain for cancellation of the war 
ciebts. .
Thus b}' remaining, out of the fight 
we allow Japan to continue- on her 
way toward a financial debacle which 
may- possibly result in a revolution 
at homeland the overthrow of the 
present military clique. In - addition 
we deprive France of an opportunity 
to increase her bargaining power at 
our expense when we refuse to be
come alarmed over the Shanghai 
properties.
Until we generate a few diplomats 
of the Franklin type capable of bor
rowing money from France, the less 
we entrust our national destiny to 
boycotts, international police forces 
arid diplomacjr, the better off we 
will be.
Eta Kappa Nu
Eta Kappa Nu, National Elec
trical Engineering Honorary, held 
its first meeting of the semester 
last Thursday. It was decided at 
that tin.e to award each year 
to the highest ranking junior a 
suitably engraved hand-book for 
Electrical Engineers. These awards 
.will be sponsored by Eta Kappa 
Nu together with A. I. E. E. 
Each time the. man will, be chosen 
by the faculty members of the 
Electrical Engineering Department 
and the officers of the organiza
tions making the award. The 
choice will be determined by the 
sophomore standing of the student. 
His general attitude, activities, and 
scholarship will be the influencing 
factors.
It is planned that this award will 
be made each year on Carnegie 
Day. Awards are to begin in 1932 
and take place each year thereafter.
Eta Kappa Nu is an Electrical 
Engineering Honorary whic !i 
chooses its members from the most 
outstanding juniors and seniors. A. 
L E. E. .is. an organization for all 
Electrical Engineers. Its purpose 
is to investigate and to make fa
