Varsity Basketeers 
Annex Three Wins 
In 1929-1930 Season
Entire Squad With Exception 
of High Eligible For 
1931 Season
The basketball squad has ended 
(he present floor season during which 
they were able to annex the scalps 
of but three of their rivals. Coach 
Hogan started practice shortly before 
the Christmas holidays with over 
twenty men on the squad. On Decem
ber 27 they journeyed to Youngs
town where they adminisiercd a 
severe drubbing to the Y. M. C. A. 
From here they went to Toledo and 
were again successful, this time at the 
expense of St. John's University. 
The outlook seemed bright for a 
good season; but the hopes of 'he 
student body were short-lived, for 
West Virginia beat the varsity very 
decisively at Morgantown in the next 
game. Following the game with the 
Mountaineers the Tartans met Pitt 
at the home gyni and were nosed 
out by six points in the second half. 
In this game the members of the 
squad reached a peak of perfection 
that was never again attained for 
the rest of the season. January 11, 
the team entrained for  State Col
lege where they met with another 
defeat. Washington was the scene 
of the next tilt, in which W. & J. 
proved they had a better team than 
we had. After the game with the. 
Presidents the Skibos returned to 
Pittsburgh where they met with two 
reverses on their own floor at the 
hands of Michigan State and Grove 
City. Geneva College won the next 
game from the Skibos after a hardfought, interesting game at Beaver 
Falls in which the score was even 
at the end of the regular game, but 
the Presbyterians forged ahead in 
the extra period. The Tartans then 
met the great Pitt team and failed to 
make a showing comparable with 
that of the first game, and were 
again defeated. January 29 was the 
date of the Westminster game which

Airport Designing Lecture Interests Seminar Students
"The most important considera
tion in the design of a landing 
field is the selection of site. The 
selection is a highly technical prob
lem involving knowledge of avia
tion, city planning, transportation, 
meteorology, .finance and law.
With these words, John J, Kilmitski, senior, began his civil semi
nar lecture Wednesday.; The sub
ject of his paper was Require
ments, Design and Construction of 
Airports."
The speaker stated further that 
the site must be flat, or nearly so. 
Open spaces arc desirable to wind
ward of the field, for most acci
dents occur immediately- after the 
plane leaves the ground. Welldrained soil, not too dry, is essen
tial, if wind or dust is to be avoid
ed. The field must be in a locality 
where haze and fogs arc nearly ab
sent. Strong or shifting winds are 
also objectionable.
The sizes of landing fields as re
quired by the Department of Com
merce vary from 1320 to 2500 feet 
of landing area in, all directions. 
Landing strips must .be 500 feet 
Avide and from 1600 to 2500 feet 
long, and so arranged that landing 
is permitLed in . at least eight dif
ferent directions. These strips must 
cross each , other or converge in 
not under 40 degrees jn the case 
of the large fields, while a 60 de
gree minimum is permitted in a 
smaller field. :
( Airports arc of several types. 
The ground may be a graded and 
drained turf surface, a gradient of 
5 per cent to 2 per cent. Selected 
. soils, sandy-clay, gravel, crushed 
stone and cinders arc used also in 
some cases. Still another surface 
may be prepared by oiling the 
ground, while asphaltic concrete, 
roncrcte, or sheet asphalt arc some
times used. .
The last, part of Mr. Kilmitskis 
lccturc was on the lighting of air
plane fields. He declares that ex
periments in the illumination of 
airways began in this country in 
1921, but it was not until three 
years later that the first night air
way was inaugurated by the Post 
Officc Department. Today there 
is a pathway stretching almost 
across the continent to guide the 
night mail pilots. More than 800

Accusations Fly Thick And Fast
When The Students Speak Out
Theyre at it againthese awful, 
radical, communistic, idealistic, rat
tle-headed, inexperienced collegc 
students 1 This time The Students 
Speak Out through the medium of 
i symposium from twenty-two col
leges, published by the New Re
public. Down through the cen
turies, as the political speaker says, 
students have been accusing the 
older generation of not educating 
them properly. The chances are 
theyve all- been right;certain it 
is that cach generation finds the 
preceding one unbelievably, preju
diced, conservative, and impossible; 
At any rate in The Students Speak 
Out, the students procccd to pour 
out the iusual concoction of wild 
Utopian schcmcs, embittered com
plaints, impassioned pleadings for 
the uplift of the soul, and rivers 
ai rivers of pure tomniyrot. 
H ow-som e-cver, thars gold in 
them tliar--rivers.
Nothing -'onncctcJ with college 
escapes the thoroughness of these
out-spoken accusations, denounce
ments, and hopes for future up
heavals.
Ninety per cent of all text
books have verbal apoplexy, factual 
malnutrition, rir.d ideational 
sterility.
The larpest portion of what is 
taught is tommy-rot, and it is 
taught back/ards. ,
"A subway commute- who 
n ,'er been to sea '^nnot tcach a 
sailor navigation, nor can a teaciicr 
who has never lived cach the ;.rt 
of living/
I suspect thcrV is as' much 
pleasure in gcttinn drunk with t'-r 
f.ce-thinkcr across ti c hall as with 
a "brother in the bond.
The faculty has became a haven 
foi mediocre talent, worn-out or 
timid spirits, and retired missionsrics.

his reports at the meeting last 
Thursday, March 6, after the in
stallation of the ncwly-electcd offi
cers. In his report to the conven
tion on the Carnegie Chapter,

which his chapter held its meetings, 
its high scholastic requirements, 
and its financial condition, which 
was the best in the history of this 
chapter. Dodges report of the con
vention to the Chapter was char
acterized principally by his state
ments about the exceptionally high 
quality of the delegates and the 
recommendations by the conven

Tom Skeyhill Will 
Be Lecturer Tues., 
At Belleeld Y
Noted Traveler, Playwright 
and Author Will Close 
Lecture Series
Theodore Roosevelt once said of 
Tom Skeyhill I would rather be 
on the platform with Tom Skey
hill than any other man 1 know. 
Pittsburghers will have the rare 
privilege of hearing this most pop
ular and sought after young lec
turer when Skeyhill comes to speak 
from the platform of the Morris 
Kaufmann Memorial next ,T ucsda^, 
March 18. The tenth and last 
speaker in this season's lccture 
series at the Y. M. and W. H. A., 
Skeyhill is best known as an au
thor and orator.
.V.; a result of his being stricken 
stond-blind while fighting Arabs in 
the Dardanelles, Skeyhill spent 
three of his last fourteen years in 
total darkness, but miraculously 
recovered his sight at Washington, 
D. C., in 1918. Having traveled 
over a million miles, visiting every 
country in Europe except Portugal, 
and having been in the thick of 
three revolutions, Skeyhill has taken 
personal interest in world affairs 
and obtained first-hand knowledge 
of the subjects which, he discusses.
His fame as a lecturer extends 
back to 1924, in which year he 
delivered 300 addresses. In that 
year lie also made plans for an
other European trip. In 1926 he

Roller-Skating And Top-Spinning 
Become Popular At New Haven 
4s Spring Affects Yale Seniors
New Haven, Conn.Though the 
year is young, spring is here and 
the sap is in the trees. And with 
the coming of spring the Yale 
Carppus is alive with top-spinning, 
hprseshoc-pitching, and, on the 
paved portions, roller-skating. In
dulgence in these amusements it 
seems, is a custom holy to seniors 
in Yale College and this years 
crop of B. A.s and Ph. B.s are 
adhering to-custom for all theyre 
worth.
The curious thing about, the topspinning is that it is performed .by 
what used to be known as the 
girls method in the good old 
days. That is, it is done by an 
underhand movement.
Whether or not the seniors use 
roller-skates merely- to move be
tween lectures or whether they 
spend their spare time at that sport 
is hard to determine, but at any 
rate, the casual walker about the 
campus and adjacent university 
territory must look lively in order 
to avoid being knocked over by a 
sedate senior.
It also appears that the seniors
are the only ones privileged to 
move about with their heads un
covered. They tell a story of a 
certain professor in the Sheffield 
Scientific School who went abroad 
by day without his hat, feeling, no 
doubt, that New Havens balmy 
air would do him good, and who 
was caught in the act by a num
ber of seniors. He was reported 
to the Dean, and so tradition has 
it, was severely reprimanded.
Shop-windows all over town are 
full of roller-skates and tops of all 
sizes, shapes and colors. This is, 
the tops, not the roller-skates. A 
brisk trade is being done in these 
articles.
Other amusements of the mo
ment arc poking fun at the new 
quadrangle plan, for - which Yale 
received a gift of about 20 million 
dollars recently, and going to. New 
York for the week-end. The latter 
city is but an hour and 40 min
utes away; the fare is but $2.61 
and hence from Friday afternoon 
till Monday morning, New Haven, 
in the. neighborhood of Yale, is 
almost entirely deserted.
PLEBE BANS WILL 
BE LIFTED TODAY 
BY COUNCIL ORDER
Regulations Drawn Up to 
Govern Conduct At 
Plebe Prom
Recent Vacancies Filled
West Virginia Permitted to 
Use Carnegie Song in 
Song Book
Mr. Ycrina, chairman of the Plcbe 
Regulations Committee of Student 
Council, rccommendcd at the meet
ing of Council 011 March 4 that 
plebc regulations be discontinued 
today at noon. Last year regula
tions were discontinued previous to 
the Christmas recess, but owing- to 
the fact that such a short period 
of regulations did not allow the 
freshman class to become unified, it 
was decidcd that the period of 
regulations should be extended until 
the spring. After some discussion 
the recommendation of Mr. Ycrina 
was approved by Council.
Mr. Ycrina also read a letter to 
be sent to Dean Tarbcll containing 
recommendations to govern the con
duct of next year's Plcbe Prome
nade. These regulations were drawn 
up so that next years regulations 
chairman might have something 
definite by which to govern the 
freshmen.
Further business concerning the 
freshmen included the appointment 
of Mr. Bunker as chairman of a 
committee to draw up sugggestions 
for Freshmen Week. This com
mittee will confer with the Dean 
of Women and the Dean of Men.
A letter from the compilers of 
the West Virginia Song Book ask
ing permission to use the song, 
Fight for the Glory of Carnegie, 
in their new book, was read. A 
motion wan carried that West - V-ir^| 
ginia be granted permission to use 
this song.
In the absence of Mr. Ashwcll, 
chairman' of the Spring Carnival 
Committee, Mr. Yerina gave the 
report for that committee. He re
ported that the complete program 
had been presented to the deans 
for approval, but owing to the 
fact that there was some dissatis
faction with the events scheduled

LEADS ORCHESTRA AT 
WOMENS JUNIOR PROM
Twenty=Two Students 
From Foreign Lands 
Enrolled At Carnegie
The report of a rcccnt census 
shows that there are-now 22 for
eign students working for a de
gree at Carnegie T ecli. Of the

of the College of Engineering. 
Four are Engineering and Indus
tries freshmen, one an Industries 
student and two arc enrolled in 
the College of Fine Arts.

hampered by a strange language 
these students always maintain a 
high scholastic rating. Most of 
them leave their homes in distant 
countries for a four-year period 
attending classes during the regula
tion school year and working at 
various occupations during the 
summer months and the holiday 
seasons. Several of them do out
side work along with their school

Alumnus Addresses Chemistry Seminar 
On Non-Corrosive?
At a rcccnt meeting of the 
Chemistry Seminar, W. I. Sivitz, of 
the Class of 1908, now the Pitts
burgh representative of the Durcr011 Company, delivered a lcctiPrc 011 
the subject of Non-Corrosive Ap
paratus. Mr. Sivitz has been per
sonally conncctcd with the commer
cial development of corrosion-resisting materials, among which is 
duriron, a combination of silicon 
and iron, the qualities of which lie set forth.
In his lecture Mr. Sivitz dis
cussed non-mctallic and metallic 
materials, as well as alloys, as 
substances being used for the con
struction of apparatus to serve as 
containers for acids and other cor
rosive chemicals. Among the vari
ous interesting alloys considered 
are aluminum bronze, Monel Metal, 
chromium alloys, and Duriron.
 A feature of the instructive lec
ture. wrere the numerous peculiar 
phenomena, which Mr. Sivitz de
scribed, of the actions of the cor
rosive chemicals, on the containers. 
In the case of aluminum as a ves
sel for. glacial acetic acid there is 
a remarkable difference of the ac
tion of slightly'' impure and abso
lutely pure acid on the metal: 100 
per cent pure acetic acid will cor
rode the aluminum container nearly 
1,000 times as fast as will the 99.99 
per cent pure acid. Another illus
tration was that of the behavior of 
concentrated sulfuric acid on an 
iron or steel,, container. As long 
as the ferrous sulfate is formed 
no corrosion will take place, since 
it forms a protective wating on 
the container; however, if the fer
ric salt is allowed to form by ex
posure to the air, corrosion will set 
in because of the oxidizing char
acter of this salt.
In his discussion of Duriron, 
Mr. Sivitz claimcd. this to be an 
exceedingly resistant material to 
acid solutions. Duriron, conse
quently, is being widely used where 
corrosive chcmicals arc handled and 
is meeting with considerable success. Mr. Sivitz gave particular 
attention to the chromium alloys, 
among which arc stainless steel, 
Durimat A and B,' and Nirosto. 
The last named alloy is supplanting 
chromium plating for use as radia
tor shells, since it has an attractive 
finish and has no plating to be worn off.

creative force from a vital interest 
in human personalities.
His first play t. be produced was 
The Return Half (called in Amer
ica "The Round Trip), which Mrs. 
Martin Browne, to whose help he 
owed much, directed in London in 
1924. "Young Woodley," written im
mediately afterwards, v/as banned Sy 
the English censor because it dealt 
with the Public Schools; first pro
duced, therefore, in New York, it 
made a big success, and afterwards, 
the bail being removed, duplicated 
that success in London. This was 
the first of those studies of boys 
and young men which have been Mr, 
van Druten'fl most valuable wo.k

tained in After All." Following Ibis 
came Chanco Acquaintance," a light 
comedy; Diversion/' a tragedy shot 
with delicate humor; The Return of 
the Soldier, a tensive war drama, 
and finally, After All.
After All" is receiving its first 
American production, at the Little 
Theater. This play is the most faith
ful piecc of naturalistic Writing ?'t\ 
van Druten has ever' produced. It 
deals with the family life of middleclass London, Thu six Scenes ate 
separated by considerable distances in 
time, and no climax is reached in 
the play. Rather is it a play of r^il 
life, without beginning, without end, 
conceding nothing to the theater's de
mands, yet positively exciting on the 
stage becaUBu its people are so alive 
and its situations sO true. There is 
a thread' of serious reflection which 
cuts down to the very root of family 
life, and shows up in faithfully inti
mate detail the eternal cleavage be
tween parents and children. They've 
got to grow up, and weve got to 
grow old, as the- last of the play's 
fathers puts it. But there Is also a 
wealth of comedythe aunt with her 
everlasting adage, "Dear me, how 
time flics"the family servant, the 
mother who can't re '* saying, -You 
might at least wait until I'm dead." 
At which last, one of the auditors 
at the first performance describes 
himself as giving a yell compounded 
of a mixture of laughter with O 
Cod, how often have 1 heard that I 
That is the delight of the play 
what a critic called its impassioned 
realism. And that is the reason why 
one believes that Mr. van Druten has 
a fine future before him. He sees 
life truly, and also he loves life; he 
has a passion for understanding it 
and interpreting it. Of such ma
terial is the goodeven the great 
dramatist made.

E. Marlin Browne, sTager of this 
play, gives the following sketch of 
van Druten: John van Druten is one 
of the outstanding English dramatists 
of the younger generation. On the 
production of his third play in Lon
don, Herbert Far jeon, one of the 
leading critics of the town, went so 
far a V to say that he 'may now ba 
definitely ranked atnoiig the foremost 
living English playwrights,' His rise 
has been as swift as that of Noel 
Coward, and like Coward, he has 
enjoyed a success in America parallel 
With that in his own country. Few 
Pittsburghers will have forgotten his 
Young Woodley, as Glenn Hunter 
and Hotel! Cahagan played it, and 
few; who heard him will have failed 
to be attracted I. his personal charm 
rtK a lcciurcr on his visits o 1926 
und 1927."
Mr. van Druten is u Londoner 
borti and bred. Contrary to the ex
pectations of mort people. Young 
Woodley was not written from ex
perience, for his education was like
wise given him in London, and many 
o the features of the boarding school 
system, which he seems to under
stand so well, were absent from his 
school, to which he went daily from 
home. After graduating in Law at 
the University -of London lie went 
as Tutor in Law to the University 
of Wales at Aberystwyth. His vaca
tions, however, were spent entirely 
in the theater, and ho was a de
votee of the famous experimental 
theater, The Everyman at Hamp
stead. In his leisure moments he 
early began .to write plays, He is 
blest j witfi a memory of acute ac
curacy and apparently inexhaustible 
capacity, and everything he sawand

Night Student Pictures of Groups

Being Taken.

Of course you arc going to put 
your feet on the new rug in the 
Club room in Industries Building. 
You havent seen such a roomwell, 
you dont know what you are missing. 
Better go over to the first floor 
down by the Y office and take a 
look, pictures n everything. And, of 
coursc, you are NOT going to put 
your ashes on the said rug. They 
have furnished ash receivers for c^ir 
convenience and these no doubt will 
be used. Dont let it be said that 
night students arent appreciative even 
if you should be tempted to forget 
once in a while. Speaking of the 
rug, however, it surely is an addi
tion. I suppose you would call it 
Wine Color or Burgandy or what, 
you tell me. It ma'de me feel that I had 
stepped into some palace instead ot 
Industries. See what a little fixings 
here and there will do. At all events 
we are thankful' for the raise.
Pictures and more picturesthe 
Thistle photographer is here and he 
seems to be a busy mortal. I wonder 
where all those night students came 
from. On Monday night I thought 
all of Pittsburgh was trying to get 
into the Union, and when I reached 
the place I found that the Photograph
er was taking Thistle Pictures. They 
tell me thirteen pictures were taken 
on Monday evening alone. I dont 
know how many were taken on the 
other evenings, but I am sure that 
the response was equally as enthus
iastic. Judging from the response 
the night men, and when I say men, 
I mean women too, made to the call 
they received.
Saturday afternoon I came out to 
:hc campus, and just as 1 reached, 
'.here a very serious accident had 
occurred at Morewood avenue and 
Forbes street. A Lincoln car ran 
up  on the pavement into the iron 
trolley pole which is along side of 
the Shelter Pavilion. If this pole 
had not been there one of the shelter 
booths would have been demolished. 
The fbrce with which the car struck 
the pole Was certain to make a dint 
in the masonry. The whole front 
of the machine was wrecked. The 
accident was caused when two, cars 
came into the same territory to
gether, one from Morewood aVcnue 
and the other down  Forbes street, 
going towards town. Now I am 
certain this would not have occurred 
if the safety light had been erected 
at this junction. This is the second 
accident which I have seen this year, 
and both of them could have been 
avoided. Traffic should be regulated 
at this point. Last Monday night it 
took me five minutes to cross the 
street here. Think of itfive min
utes, and five minutes of my < time 
isn't very valuable, but multiply this 
by five and then by thirty, or per
haps you better get your slide rule 
out "engineers please note," and you 
will see what time is lost by each 
student who is delayed while cross
ing. Moralget the Safety Light 
working and stop waste.
While on the Campus last Satur
day afternoon, I noticed that the 
grass had started to . spring up. The 
quadrangle was a carpet of vivid 
green. Sure is a pretty sight, to 
behold. The trees have not as yet 
started to bud out, but it wont be 
long now until they will start to 
leaveI mean leaf. We have a very 
beautiful campus setting and the night 
students should be proud .of it, even 
if they do go to school by the light 
of the moon.
And Group Pictures 
For 1930 Thistle
During the past week and con
tinuing this week pictures of Night 
Students will be taken for the 1930 
Thistle. Several group pictures 
have already been taken, and the 
Night College of Engineering group 
pictures arc scheduled to be taken 
Wednesday evening, March 12 at 
10:10 oclock in the Union. All 
night engineers arc expected to 
come over for these pictures and 
make a good showing for their 
college.
Announcements have been sent 
out relative the individual pictures 
which are necessary for the grad
uates. These men are urged' to see 
the photographer who is located in 
Room 2, Industrie's; Building. He 
will make sittings on Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday, March 
10, 11, and 12 of this week, be
tween 6:00 P. M. and 8:30 P. M. 
If you are in doubt as to whether 
you will finish this year or not, 
consult your instructor and he will 
let 3'ou know if you have fulfilled 
all requirements for certificate or 
degree.
The group pictures which have 
been taken arc the most satisfac
tory which have ever been taken 
at night before. This condition 
was made possible only bjf the co
operations which we received from 
the night students. To begin with 
we had only a very short notice 
and equally only a short time in 
which to schedule pictures, and un
der this handicap, the response 
which we received from the in
structors and night student body 
is commendable. It certainly shows 
that the night students arc inter
ested in this publication. We hope 
that the individual pictures which 
are scheduled for this week will 
be equally as successful. Remem

It is a greater act to restore 
than to create, to-bring the diso
bedient will back to obedience than 
to will it into, existence, to recon
cile enemies than to create wor
shippers, to redeem than to make.
Men should often renew their 
good resolutions, and not lose 
heart because they are tempted 
against them.

With the Washingtons Birthday 
Dance, now a thing of the past, there 
are several weeks that the social 
activities of the, Night Students arc 
in a sort of unconscious state from 
whence they will recover about the 
last week of this month. This period 
of inactivity comes as a relief to the 
officers of the Night Colleges and 
the members of the various commit
tees besides giving everybody an op
portunity to devote their time un
interrupted to their studies.
The end of March will see the 
revival of things entertaining when 
the Night Engineers hold their final 
smoker of the year on March 26 
in the Union. Next on the program 
comes the Second Semester Smoker 
of the Night College of Industries. 
This function will be held in the 
new gym as usual and indications 
arc that this affair will surpass any 
thing ever put on by this group.
.The Night Arts have a dance 
scheduled *in the Union, and it won't 
be surprising if this enthusiastic 
group doesnt sponsor one of the 
finest hops ever held on the Campus 
when they get together for their 
last dance of the j-ear on April 5.
Of course it is only natural that 
th final function on the Night So
cial Calendar should be the greatest 
of them all. If you havent guessed 
it,,we refer to the Inter-Night School 
Dance of the Night Student Council 
to be held in the new gym on May 
9. This affair will be a fitting climax 
to a very successful year as far as 
Night Student Council Danccs are 
concerned. The first. dances held in 
the gym were more or less experi
ments in one way or another but all 
difficulties have been overcome and 
if the Washingtons Birthday Dance 
can be taken as an example, we are 
assured of the finest conditions pos
sible and a very enjoyable time at 
all future dances.

"One Lovely Moron (Doublcday, 
Doran), by Lucian Cary, is a cam
pus romance done in approved 
stylewhich all means it is heartily 
recommended by this campus pen 
pusher.
"Unmarried Life (Dufficld), by 
John North, is a nicc enough novel 
about a family totally confused in 
their attempts to marry and unmarry each other. Youll wonder 
what its all about in the end. Good 
enough.
"Pure Gold (Harpers), by O. E. 
Rolvaag, is done in the best Rolvaag style. A brief review of any 
of Rolvaags books could1 be this: 
A man, a.woman, a house, a Middle 
West prairie, loneliness, grimness, 
epic quality and Rolvaag. Mix the 
lot, presto, a story. Take it or 
leave it.
"Dancc, Little Gentleman (Same), 
by Gilbert Frankau is about a 
gigolo who loves living, and not 
money. The situation being un
usual the book is saved from fall
ing into the pack of gigolo books 
that have been published lately.
Hollywood Gold (Macaulay)', is 
by Phyllis Gordon Dcmarcst. Stay 
about two thousand miles away 
from this tome, and if the stench 
reaches you, run like hell!
Incidentally, didja notice that 
some columnist is gonna get 
good punch in the nose if they 
don't step mentioning this review. 
Sounds fishy to me. Gr-r-r-r.

STOP AND THINK
Have you ever-stopped to think 
of the possible outcome of this 
machine age in which we arc liv
ing? What the fu'Furc holds for 
the working man is problematical 
in view of the ever increasing num
ber of labor saving dcviccs.
Not so many years ago it was 
possible for a man to get employ
ment almost anywhere but in re
cent years this has become quite 
a task unless the man is an. ex 
perienccd machine operator or a 
skilled craftsman. Another condi
tion that, exists to make the em
ployment question more difficult is 
the increase in population of our 
country. The births outnumber the 
deaths while the immigration of 
willing workers and skilled crafts
men from foreign countries doesnt 
help to dear the situation in the 
least. Many farmers in our own 
country are,...being attracted to the 
city by the so-called big wages' and 
their entrance into the industrial 
ccntcrs together with the invasion 
of foreign workmen have more 
than filled the demand for labor and 
they are a bit reluctant to return to 
their homes after becoming accustomcd 
to the more leisure life of the city. 
Many of these become public 
ward who are keut by the tax
payers of the community.
It has been said that "necessity 
is the mother of invention and, 
to those mortals who have the 
foresight to recognize a need and 
the ingenuity and determination to 
carry their idea to a practical end, 
all crcdit is due. Their invention, 
while profitable to themselves, may 
be a boon to their fellow workmen 
or it,, may be a means of putting 
countless numbers out of employ
ment.
This seems to be an era of 
specialists and with this thought in 
mind it becomes the duty of each 
and every one of us to excel in 
that phase of work we have choscn for our lifes work. We are 
all here in school for that purpose, 
although perhaps you have never 
thought of it in this way. The 
students who see their own need 
of a better education arc/bound to 
become more skilled than their 
fellow workers, who are satisfied 
to go as they please with no 
thought .of the-future, and- thereby 
increase their value to their em
ployers, themselves, and to society.
TREASURER
Mr. James S. Geyser, whose pic
ture appears above, holds the office 
of treasurer in the Night Student 
Council. Like the other officers 
whose pictures have been published 
during the past few weeks, he has 
been a student on the Campus fot 
several years. He is registered in 
the Night College of Industries 
and enrolled in the Typography 
course and kindred subjects.
Mr. Geyser is the news editor of 
the Plaid this year, and served in 
the capacity of associate news edi
tor for the College of Industries 
last year. He was also editor-inchief of the 1929-30 Night Student 
Carnegie Handbook. All of these 
night student undertakings have 
been handled in a manner which 
shows considerable ability.
He has also taken keen interest 
in all Night Student Activities and 
is the big man when it comes to 
arranging the bouts which Indus 
tries put on at their Smokers. He 
has the Wrestling art down to a 
finish, and has Won many prizes in 
contests in which he has been 
engaged.
A WORD ON SPORTS
Once in a great while there is 
something on the "Plaid page with 
reference to sports or athletics. Why 
there is not more o'. it, we. say lot 
the night .student body is just as 
much athletic minded as any other 
group of people.
The. Gariiegic-footballers never play 
a home game without. a large as
sortment of night, students being on 
hand * to root for  their favorites. 
Many night students take in the 
basketball games when possible to do 
so without interfering with their 
classes.
The Night Student Body joins the 
rest of the Carnegie supporters in its 
congratulations to John E. Dreshar 
on the occasion of his reappointment 
as captain of the Carnegie football 
team for 1930. He has been an out
standing linesman on the Skibo team 
for the last two years and his re
appointment exemplifies the high 
esteem that the coaches have of his 
playing ability and as a leader of 
men.
Coach Hogans first' year as Car
negie basketball mentor was no great 
success as far as games won and 
lost arc concern. I but in the next 
couple years after lie gets his sys
tem of play functioning we can look 
fo> brighter results from his squad.
By the way, there was some talk 
last year. of Carnegie going in for 
wrestling as a College sport. We 
havent heard anything about it this 
year and have been wondering wliat 
happened that the matter-was drop
ped.
DIDJA NOTICE
Didja notice that a model is a 
model, even if she happens to be 
an heiress, and it doesnt make any 
different to Carnegie Tech?
Didja notice that Greta Garbo 
doesnt have the accent you might 
expect, and makes quite a success 
of her first talkie?
Didja notice that. hes still in 
town?
Didja notice the silly look on 
most of the Nitc Arts the last few 
nights? Theyve been having their 
pictures taken.
Didja notice how really good the 
book review is getting?
Didja notice that exhibition down 
at McCrccrys?
Didja notice that one of the 
Nite Arts (female) in Mr. W.s 
class thinks a flying fish has 
feathers?
Didja notice that you can slide 
down the bannisters very nicely 
now that they have been waxed?
Didja notice that model doing 
the Highland Fling a week or so 
ago in the Hall (Arts)?
Didja notice that the following 
is quite a tasty dish? You mix 
chopped dates, marshmallows, Pe
ruvian nuts, and chushcd Graham 
crackers, separately into thick melt
ed chocolate. The result, chillcd 
and served with whipped cream or 
banana ice cream makes a darn 
good dish. For full particulars

SOME FACTS ON 
THE LIFE OF JOHN
WHITE ALEXANDER
Alexander was born in Pittsburgh 
in the year of 1S56. Restless with 
ambition, he went to New York 
when very young and applied for! 
work with Harper and Brothers. 
Upon being refused, lie developed 
a scheme for improving the. penny 
valentine. He was finally given 
the position of office boy, and after 
eight months of faithfully perform
ed drudgery, obtained work in the 
Art department. As soon' as he 
was financially able, lie went to 
Paris to study. liindcrecl by his 
ignorance of the French language, 
he moved on to Munich, where lie 
won his first medal. From that 
on. his career was a scries of tri
umphs. Soon he was recognized 
as a leading artist on both sides of 
the Atlantic. He spent six months 
of the year in Paris and six months 
in the United States. He combin
ed, successfully, his American origi
nality and vigor of treatment with 
the best elements of the French 
technique, which has contributed 
so much to the modern school of 
painting. His principal works arc 
portraits and mural decorations. 
Perhaps his most famous work is 
the Evolution of the Book," paint
ed in six epochs, on the walls of 
the Congressional library. An
other one of his interesting decor 
rations may be seen by the stu
dents in the corridors and stairsways of our own Carnegie Insti
tute.
The artist delights to illustrate 
a single idea, and, when it is a 
rare and mysterious one, as in the 
case of the "Pot of Basil, it gives 
freer scope of his genius. In thi 
picture, .the long flowing lines, the 
veiled tones, the subdued colors, 
the absence "of detail, and th 
dense background, all contribute to 
the feeling of mystery; The very 
lines of the girls figure in its 
grace and unconscious pose appeals 
to us. "Much of the tenderness ex
pressed in every line of the face 
and figure is due to the lighting of 
the picture, which is from below 
bringing out most prominently the 
pathos of the sensitive mouth and 
chin. Alexanders paintings, espe
cially his mural subjects, are treat
ed in a highly decorative manner, 
The "Pot of Basil" has. the Japan
ese decorative quality in color, line, 
and treatment. The beauty of tin 
picture is'extremely formal. The 
subject, a girl, who is the embodi
ment  of silent, hopeless grief, cxcites sympathy. Her young life 
seems so blighted, that she appears 
hardly to live in this world.,'
PLEBE BANS WILL
BE LIFTED TODAY
There arc hundreds of ways of 
being considerate. Being careful 
means something more than being 
courteous.

For over sixty years we 
have been helping young people with their financial affairs and showing them how a^ sound banking conncction aids them on the way to succcss. Your future prosperity depends on thrifty > habits in spending and saving; a bank account will teach you to handle money, wisely and will give you a.

Rev.Galbreath To
Speak At Chapel
The Rev. Robert Galbreath, 
pastor of-the Bellevue Presby
terian Church, i? the speaker 
at the Chapel services which will 
be held today at 12:30 in the 
Little Theater. The subject of 
his address is, "World Peace and Religion.
Mr. Galbreath has spoken here 
before and is very popular with 
the student body. A graduate of. 
Westminster College, he held a 
charge in Colorado for a few 
years before coming cast and 
taking a church in Aliquippa. 
During the World war Mr. Galbreath- was in France with Mr. 
Davis of the Y. M. C. A.
The program also includes 
Miss Lcota McNemry of the 
music department, violin soloist,, 
and Miss Thelma Smeltzcr, or
ganist. The Chapel exercise this 
week is the last that the Fresh
men Y. M. C. A. cabinct aids in 
sponsoring, and it is hoped that 
the service will be well attended.

Harnessing Niagara Falls 
to the washing machine
Cheaper power! Groping after this modern 
touchstone to wealth, deluded inventors slaved 
over perpetual motion machines ... informed 
inventors evolved the turbine... broad visioned 
men harnessed the rush of waters... engineers 
raised pressures and temperatures to producc 
more power without corresponding increases 
of cost.
While, step by step, this progress has taken 
place, the many men who have contributed to 
it could not know what far-reaching results it 
would have. Now the ultimate boons grow 
clear. Water power development becomes 2 
national policy, steam bids fair to rival water 
power for cheapness, economically produced 
power brings more plentiful goods, lights houses 
and hauls crowds in cities, is carried to rural 
sections to lift washday drudgery from farm

Among the many industrial victories that are 
behind this revolution, none is more important 
than wider knowledge of piping materials and 
better materials. One of the highly prized 
chapters of our history is the contribution that 
Crane research and valve engineering has made 
to the general advance. The results of this 
research are embodied in a Crane book,P/W<?ringin Scteuce. It is a fascinating story of engi

work for engineering students. A request will 
bring you a copy.

(Continued from Page One)
Several years of study in Europe 
and travel in the Orient enabled 
her to bring unusual knowledge 
and culture to her chosen field, 
and in the colleges where she 
taught she raised the course of 
Costume Economics to. the dignity 
of one of the fine arts. She was 
Assistant Professor of Household 
Arts and Head of the Department 
of Textiles and Cothing in Teach
ers College from 19Q9 to 1921. In 
1921 she was called to Carnegie 
Tech to be Head of the De
partment of Costume Economics, 
and at once made herself a loved 
and respected member pf the 
faculty. Her many friends in 
Pittsburgh will remember her not 
only for her achievement, but for 
the vividness of her personality 
and the high courage with which 
she bore physical suffering.

devices to operate prior to the 
transmission of electrical speech 
waves. Such a system already is 
iu operation in the trans-Atlantic 
radio circuit, delaying the speech 
about two one-hundreds of a sec
ond.
A device which produces scramf 
bled or inverted speech was de
veloped about the same time the 
delayed speech mechanism was per
fected. Inverted speech is unintel
ligible to a listener and is an interr 
esting illustration of methods for 
obtaining secrecy in radio com
munication.
Mr. Grace also will demonstrate 
the new super-magnetic, metal 
known as perminvar, which has 
what engineers \ call a .constant 
"permeability over a wide range 
of magnetic force, and is to be 
used in the prospective sub-Atlantic 
telephone cable.
While scientists in the... .Bell 
laboratories, naturally are devoting 
their energies to inventions which 
will, directly benefit, the telephone 
users of the nation, much of their 
research work' has proved' of in
estimable value from purely a 
humanitarian point of view. From 
this phase of research has come 
the artificial larynx, which enables
people who have lost their laryxes 
through surgical operations .to talk 
again.
There are several hundred per
sons in the United States who have 
been deprived of the- power of 
speech, and the Bell laboratories, at 
the request of a surgeon, undertook 
the task of developing an artificial 
larynx. Today nearly 200 afflicted 
persons use this layrnx, which 
enables them to speak clearly with 
a well-modulated voice.
COLLEGE ON THE SCREEN
From an article in College Humor, entitled "Collegiate Morons it appears that the writer of the article, James Weber Linn, a university professor, has been attending too many of the rcccnt screen versions of college life.
In his article Mr...Linn says.:"Now the trouble with the (average college student is that he has too little curiosity and too little concentration. Ic does not know the rules for what we used to call having fun with your mind, He goes to class and reads assignments, and takes notes and answers questions in . a quiz 1 or lie plays football, and listens to the coach and he does as lie is told, often effectively enough; or he joins a fraternity, and associates four years with more or less interesting human beings on terms of such intimacy as he will never
have an opportunity for again perhaps, and about all he finds out about them is their particular capacity 
or lack of it to hold gin, their batting average on the college .baseball team and the n?-cs of their girls. All of which is sad.
This sort of thing is a duplicate of the impressions that the parents of college- students must get when they witness a moving picture with university or college life as the theme. Doubtless many of the things portrayed are true, but most of these things arc exaggerated' to a certain extent. A still larger part of the pictures arc false and in no way represent the actions of students on this campus.
How often have college men and women sat disgustedly through a sound picture of college life only to enjoy the themesong'and the, ignorant, caustic comments of parents who arc sitting nearby? The false impres
sion gained by parents can only bs changed by students themselves.Mr. Linn goes on tj say:He has not wasted his time. But he has missed something of grcal value, for all that; something he might have had without a sacrifice, and something which as he grows older it will be more and more difficult to acquire. He has not learned to reflect.
This accusation is no doubt true. It needs no explanation.  The Athenaeum.
Are you careful of other-peoples 
feelings?
I- am, jrou are prompt to reply, 
but, arc you sure about it?
When tribulations, infirmities, and 
contradictions come, we mut not 
run away in fright, but vanquish 
them like men.

WHAT YOUNGER COLLEGE MEN ARE DOING WITH WESTINGHOUSE
Special cars were needed...
railway tracks had to be lowered\ to handle 
the transformers these men built
AT Conowingo, Maryland, is the 
second largest hydro-electric devel
opment in the world. Power generated 
there at 220,000 volts will be fed into 
lower voltage transmission lines of the  
Public Service Electric and pas Company 
at Roseland, near Newark, New Jersey.
The transformers that will perform 
this transfer of energy are physically the 
largest ever built, for their capacity is 
sufficient to serve the home lighting 
needs of a city of a million people. 
Four in number, each is larger than a 
house, weighs when empty as much as 
a large locomotive and holds three
tank cars of oil. Four specially built 
railway cars and fifty-two standard cars 
of various types were required to trans
port them from the factory to the job.
At one point the railway tracks had to 
be lowered so the units would clear an 
overhead viaduct, so great was tKeir size.
When spectacular jobs like this 
come up, it is natural that they go to 
an institution like Westinghouse. Pio

TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 1930.THE CARNEGIE TAR,TAtfPAGE FIVE
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH Dame Football just wont stay 
out of the picture. She takes the stage, at odd intervals, from 
January until December. Her latest appearance was in the way 
of a social visitat Dr. Bakers tea held for her disciples, the 
gentlemen of the gridiron. Last Saturday was the time and the 
Presidents offices the place. According to those who were pres
ent, a good time was had by all. Dr. Baker was assisted by 
Mrs. Lanahan and Mrs. "Buddy Overend, who acted as host
esses. Mr. Buddy was there, too, and made quite a name for 
himself as a chair-shover. Rumor has it that Mr. Shanahan., of 
"Fireproof Storage and Long Distance Hauling fame is busily 
engaged in persuading him to give up athletics and go intd the 
moving game in a big way.* * * *
OH, YES! AND IF the young man who scribbles off that 
column that appears on the back page doesnt stop making wise 
cracks about our Mr. George PI. Suitt, we 11 give Georgie a 
couple of columns in our little corner to use as he sees fit.
* * * *
DURING THE NEXT FEW days (or rather the next few 
weeks, if Jupiter Pluvius acts as he has been acting) the -har
bingers of Spring will be putting in their appearance. When we 
say harbingers, we mean the robins, and the track teams, and 
the kites, and the roller skates. The track candidates have all
signed on. the dotted line and Coach Guy Halferty has issued
the shoes and sweat suits, etc. Now the stage is set for the 
scampers around the highways and byways of Schenley, -so if 
you should happen to see any odd-looking specimens of human
ity flittering around the park looking like nothing human, be as
sured that they are not the latest candidates for Dixmonttwill 
be merely Carnegie Techs cinder path warriors.
CARNEGIES SWIMMING TEAMS are coming into their 
own this year. The latest Varsity victories are those over Case 
and Western Reserve. The Plebes, too, are holding- their win
ning stride, having defeated Schenley High last week.
Coach Risedorph is to be complimented on the showing 
made by his teams this year. Carnegie never lias been endowed 
with exceptional swimmers, the excellent_ coaching- of fair ma
terial being responsible for this seasons victories. If the string 
of wins is extended still further, Carnegie will have had a ban 
ner year. As it stands now, 1930 has been the best swimming 
year in many moons.
HAPPY SPLASHES, COACH RISEDORPH*

THE INTRA-MURAL basketball .teams are still fighting
it out. Thus far, the casualties have been few, but if you know 
anything at all about these league games, the worst (or best) 
is yet to come.- This week marks the half-way point in the 
schedules, and before next Tusday rolls around, the leading 
teams will be well established in their positions. Then come 
the real gamesthose . intra-league brawls. In the meantime 
drop around to the gym some night. Youll see one or two 
eyefulls.

THE RIFLERS journeyed down to precincts of Uncle
Sams Midshipmen last week and fought matters -out, side by 
side. The Navy boys rose victorious at the end of the match, 
firing 1,375 against Carnegies 1,352. The trip to Annapolis was 
quite a journey, for a rifle teammost of the matches are fired 
at home and the scores telegraphed to the opponents. The squad 
made the trip by bus, leaving early last Thursday morning.
So we see that even if the delegates to the Naval Con.ference wont let Uncle Samuel build ships for his pupils to 
play with, they can still take to the rifles. But we ask you, 
wouldnt Rear Admiral Byrd look out of place on the poop deck 
of a row boat,;giving the command "Right shoulderARMS 1" 
to a firing squad of pop-guns.1

AND NOW, we have the weeks weakest pun, to wit: If
all the paper towels used in Engineering Hall in one day were 
laid end to end,-the janitors would think that someone was try

Thats all until next week.
MUSIC NOTES
It is interesting to see what can 
be done, in a symphonic way, by 
students worshiping at the feet of 
the musically eminent gods and 
administered the sacrament by a 
priest of these gods. Things are 
looking up, may We say, on the 
Mezzanine in the College of Fine 
Arts. If they keep looking sky
ward, the P & Ds will soon have 
their- domain usurped, their easels 
replaced by music stands, their 
models, by conductors. Their sky
lights will allow our dusky Pitts
burgh sunshine a new pleasure, one 
of receiving light for light, and 
new colors for old.
If you heard the symphony Sun
day night you heard a composer 
who can be delightfully modern in 
a Victorian way. He is not pre
tentious. He is modest and artisti
cally conscientious. The Franck 
symphony, the only one Franck 
wrote, is as pleasant as a warm 
sultry night, under a grape arbor, 
with the crushed grape tang in the 
air, whose pleasant stickiness is 
broken by a sharp thundershower. 
In the second movement the strings 
executed the muted overhanging 
cloud that drifted in whisps back 
and forth with such feeling one 
was surprised but pleased. We 
 have an idea, since the tempo of 
the third movement, allegro non 
troppo, did not click or seem to 
fit in with the scheme of things, 
that it was a bit too fast. It seem
ed a shame not to linger a shade 
longer on certain poignant bits of 
melody. They were rushed through 
with almost metronomical accuracy.
"When words fail one, they tell
you break into a^song." I feel like 
floating a tone out of the top of 
my head.  I feel like floating away 
on it. You see, Ive just heard 
Wagner. And he always affects me 
to such an extent that it doesnt 
matter -how it be played, I natur
ally defy all laws of gravitation 
and float toward the clouds. But 
I do remember that all depart
ments of the orchestra outdid 
themselves, perhaps carried away 
as I, was with the wonder and the 
magic of the master mind that con
ceived it all.
Louis Crowded carried away indi
vidual honors with his playing of 
the Piano Concerto with Orches
tra, by Tchaikovsky. Carried them 
away with three encore hands 
which werent nearly enough. He 
was marvelous, and of course, I 
have in mind that he is only a 
young musician. He must have" a 
world of soul, to speak, for he 
says it so beautifully. He caressed 
the keys as though he loved them 
and they responded as if they lov
ed him. They spoke a language 
never before heard by this poor 
person, from the midst of our stu
dents. He is the grandest thing 
in the school.
One suggestion I have to make, 
and it was fostered by the hearing 
of Wagner, Franck, Tchaikovsky 
and Dvorak handled capably for 
the most part by these students 
who are learning, first and fore
most, not to be inadequate, music
ally. Here is out point pertinent.'

Lose To Navy In 
Meet At Academy
The Tartan riflers were added to 
the list of those defeated by the 
crack marksmen of the Naval 
Academy when the Middies outshot the Plaids 1375-1352 in a 
small bore shoulder-to-shoulder 
match at the Navy range, Satur
day. The squad, composed of Cap
tain Kasehagen, Bcckert, Scott, 
GctUer, Clithbet1!, Hopkins, Hagenlocher, Rhoades and McCloSky left 
for Annapolis by bits early Thurs* 
day morning. .Sergeant Evans ac
companied the squad as coach. A 
match to have been shot with the 
University of Maryland team was 
called off. The visitors were housed 
at the Academy, barracks while at 
Annapolis.
Thus far, the Tartan riflers have 
fallen behind the record of last 
years team. Although no National 
Rifle Association matches have yet 
bc-en lost several other intercol
legiate honors have been carried 
off by the opposing squads. The 
week ending March 1 sdrved to 
continue the sway of the jinx over 
the Tartarts. Of the three matches 
fired, the Plaids suffered three de
featsStanford University, iii a 
four position encounter, nosed the 
Techitcs out by oilly two points, 
the final scores being 1844-1842. 
The University of Washington, in 
a three-position match, handed the 
locals a more severe defciit1388- 
136S, and Iowa State, following its 
western neighbors, trounced the 
Skibos 1883-1842 in a four position 
contest.
Regardless of the various scores 
made against the opponents . other 
than those in the Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, and West Virginia Inter 
collegiate League the Tartans have 
kept a clean slate against its
League opponents. Last years 
championship team won the cup
offered by the combination, and, 
although the results of the season 
thus far arc not over-cncOUraging, 
the marksmen hope' to take the
tiophy again tills year.. The stand

Most young musicians do not hear 
enough, they do not read enough, 
they do not play enough. The 
curriculum should be made to in
clude, instead of one full orchestra 
rehearsal a week, six or seven. 
It is not enough to practice a 
symphony for two hours and a half 
-one Sunday afternoon, tear ones 
self away from the  atmosphere 
conjured up by the playing of it 
and then totally forget about it 
for a whole week, and whoever 
heard of a student obtaining a 
book written by a composer, where
in he sets forth the ma,nner and 
method he would use in interpret
in his own work, and reading it. 
Dont you think they should? 
What do you think opera stars do 
in preparation for their different 
roles? Learn to sing their arias, 
recitatives, memorize their cues and 
then suck a lemon waiting for the 
performance? Indeed nol They 
read what manners and customs 
dictated the actions of people in 
general in the age and period 'in 
which the opera is Lid. They find 
out hpw others have sung the 
same roles, they pick up flaws in 
others performances and improve 
upon^ their own. And then . . . 
they mix their own individual in
terpretation and art with that 
groundwork and render a reading 
as beautiful as it is original and natural.

Clevelands eoliegiate mermen re
ceived a drubbing from our own 
visiting natators in two dual meets 
last week. Carnegie swimmers mount
ed up the majority of points in each 
meet, and showed that they can come 
through in a pinch. The Case tank
men were submerged With a count 
of 39-36. The Western Reserves suc
ceeded In getting only 30 joints 
agr.inst Carnegies 45.
The 'triumph over Case was an 
exciting and close scoring mecti 
Points were evenly divided at tlW 
start of the last race; Here a medley 
relay team, cotnp~^d of King, Sang 
ster, and Shafer, gained for the 
Techites the necessary points to 
clinch the meet. Shafer accounted 
lot- first in the 220-yard free style 
and helped with the lbO^yard relay. 
Redding and Edwards boosted the 
scoring in the 100-yard and 40-yard 
dashes. These VacCs Wefa Very close 
and any misplacement Would have 
made a difference- in the final score. 
Although hindered by a low ceiling, 
Easier and Fuller copped first aiid 
second iii the diving events. Cap
tain Sangster came through With a 
second place in the breast stroke.
The Plaid tankmen won from 
Western Reserve With d little more 
ease, the score being 45-30. Practical
ly all of the men who placed in the 
Case meet also liUlig Up points for 
Carnegie in the Reserve tilt.
Plcbe spashers supported the weeks 
winnings with a close Victory over 
Schenley High. The yearlings massed 
30 points against 27 of their yoUngCr 
opponents. Competition Was keen, 
and the winner was not decided until 
the - finish of the last race. The 
freshmen took four first places m the 
'six events. Coulter, Cadmus, and 
Franke were unbeaten in their ef
forts. In the final event, Higuchi, 
With second placc, added the ncces
sary three points to defeat the 
Schenley nierbabes. The Plebes have 
stepped out this year with more vic
tories and lesa vivid defeats. It is 
hoped that they will gain revenge 
Upon tile Pitt freshmen on Wijdnes 
day.

Greeks, Dorms And 
Classes To Fight 
For Swimming Cup
Fun and plenty of it is in store 
for those entering the annual in*- 
tra-Mural Swimming Meet. Bar
ring. the Varsity and Flcbc teams 
of this season, the field is open 
al all day students who are in
clined to show their seaworthiness 
in the form of dissociated atoins 
exerting earnest energy Upon the 
ripples of good old fresh Water.
Competition will come from all 
sorts of notables on the CampUs. 
We will see in action everything 
from the famous drugstore cowboy 
who ricles the senior fence, down 
to the Wizard who can sleep in 
the bufikcn seat of a club-roOm 
chair. For those not living iii a 
fraternity house or dorm, a pro
vision is made for them to repre
sent their class in school. The 
Greeks Will go into solution for 
the proverbial purpose of weight
ing dowti their mantel-plecc With 
another silver cup. Of course the 
team making the most points ac
quires possession for oiic year. 
Three such victories will result in 
permanent possession.
The Kappa Sig's Were the vic
tors of last year's Watery encoun
ter. But Intra-Mural swimming is 
one sport that brings a new Win
ner with almost every year. With 
lio sure winners and points for the 
litst four places, it is obviotiS that 
ally team Will have a job to Walk 
away with the meet. Friday, March 
28, marks the day of the big splash. 
Any team that is desirous of mak
ing a good showing should join 
the rattks of those already practic
ing on Monday, Wednesday, Fri
day,; and Saturday.
This aniiUal SWiMining gala Will 
border On the bounds of a circus. 
For as in past years, many new 
styles of fin flipping Were discov
ered, and an infinite number of 
thrills result from the unheard of 
feats performed 1 the so-called 
fancy divers. To help matters 
along, five of the seven evciits 
can be won in any style providing 
the entrant traverses the distance 
in the water. Free style Is the 
place to try olit all the latest in
ventions. Rumor has it that Sortie 
a.re practicing to sink to the bot 
tom, and .hold their breath while 
they mn the 1 .iglhs in true track 
form. And still we may, see some 
hopeful come along with the idea 
of gaining firs' placc With the 
flying-fish or tadpole method.

The Scrub Who Had No Fear
At one of the middle western universities there has been a 
statue erected in honor of The Scrub. The idea behind this 
statue will stick in the mind of the hearer ev.en though he may 
not remember what school thought of this fine gesture. The 
man who is usually honored by his school is the one who makes 
the touchdown in the last minute or knocks a home run with 
the bases fullthe college hero.
But the scrub is lowly, inconspicuous, and unheeded. Day 
after day he sacrifices himself, has time and energy for.the team 
he may never make. He takes the batterings, the slams, the 
 abuses and when the time comes for a game, he sits on the 
bench hopeful, longing for a chance to prove himselfperhaps 
that time never comes, yet he goes on giving his best, faithful, 
loyal, and even hopeful. When the team is praised the only 
honor that is his is that of reflected gloryhe searches in vain 
for his name in the sport columnhe is merely a scrub.
Theres a little school out in Texas which is immensely 
proud of a pair of old, worn and ragged football pants. Are 
these the pants some hero wore when lie beat So-and-so col
lege single-handed? No. The card above them reads: "In mcm. ory of Grandpa White, the scrub who . had no fear. This me morial is far more sincere than any panegyric we have ever 
. read. It is a wonderful tribute to one man and a million others 
like him.
At one time it was suggested that this old pair of pants 
'be taken,down. Varsity men and scrubs protested with equally 
strenuous force. The pants are still there.
In sportsmanship you can not match the scrubhis spirit 
is without parallel. He is the basis of the team. The scrub 
himself may not realize it, varsity players may not, but there 
are a few coaches who do not. There is something inherently 
heroic, in him, and it is the spirit of thti scrub that makes the 
star.McGill.
VARSITY BASKETEERS
(Continued from Page One) our opponents won after an interest
ing con test,
Following the Westminster games 
Ihe squad look time out for exams 
which all the varsity men passed;' 
hut two much-needed substitutes were 
lost to the team because of ineligibil
ity. Thiel was our first opponent 
after the short vacation, and the 
Tartans clearly showed I hat I lu; lay
off had clone them no good for they 
lost the. game to a team that they 
night have beaten. After Thiel came 
W. & J. again. This time they were 
without the services of two regulars 
but some clever work by the subs 
gave them another victory. Penn 
State was nexl and although they 
had won the first game rather de
cisively the Tartans more than 
doubled their rivals score which gave 
Carnegie their third victory of the 
year. The Skibos then started east 
to play three games in four days 
with such opponents as Army, City 
College of New York, and New 
York University. Three hard games 
with no rest proved to be too much 
of a strain for the already tired 
team so there is little wonder that 
they lost all three tilts. After their 
return to Pittsburgh the Plaid team 
lost their third game to Pitt. The 
game was very interesting from 
every point of view, but perhaps the 
best thing about the game was the 
fact that it was the last time that 
Hyatt will play against a Carnegie 
team. March 1 was the date of the 
last game which we lost to Geneva 
by a close score. The Tartans look
ed impressive in the first half but 
were unable to keep up their fast
pace.
The season as a whole was un
successful if only games won or 
lost are considered, but to see cour
age and loyalty manifest itself game 
after game when the squad was up 
against insurmountable difficulties 
made the season at least .creditable. 
Coach Hogan has a system which re
quires some time for a fair trial
and it usually takes more than one 
season for the men to familiarize 
themselves with tjio intricacies of a 
new attack, With the entire team
back with the exception of Wayne 
High, and the support of the bril
liant Plebe team, the Plaid sup
porters may cxpect a most success
ful season in 1931.
A new rushing, system has been 
introduced at Ohio Wesleyan. 
Freshmen write down the names 
of from one to five fraternities 
they would like to visit. Fraterni
ties, likewise, indicate new men 
they wish to have visit them. 
Later, a clearing house is estab
lished so that fraternities and can
didates arc able to co-operalc with
out having conflicts in dates.

"If the course is a scientific om

THINK IT OVER
A Chinese attached to the present 
Nationalist Government once called 
upon Madame Sun Yat-scn at her 
grccn-shuttcred house in the French 
Concession and said, in cfiect: "If 
you were anyone but. Madame Sun, 
wc would cut your head off. And 
she replied, 'smiling cheerily at her 
sullen visitor: "If 'you were the
revolutionists you pretend to be, 
youd cut it off anyway!"
After only four brief years, Dr. 
Sun Yat-scn has already, been ele
vated to tile status of a Chinese saint 
whose doctrines, like those of Christ, 
arc excellent to use as wall mottoes 
but "too impractical for serious, guidj 
ancc in the workaday; worldi Madame 
Suns intransigence lies in her refusal 
to believe that Dr. Suns ideas, will 
not work. The peculiar obnoxiousncss 
of this attitude lies in the fact that 
she is not merely a sorrowing widow, 
hut in her own right a staunch inr 
dividual who is keeping the words of 
Dr. Sun alive.
Fully to understand the reasons 
why Madame Sun as a Left-Wing 
leader i3 particularly harassing to the 
present.decidedly Right-Wing govern-, 
mcnt, it must be borne in  mind how 
closely she is linked with that govern
ment by tics of blood. First of all, 
she is the sister of the former* Sooiig 
May-ling, now Madame Clnang Kaishek, wife of the President of. the. 
State Council. Likewise is she the 
sister of Soong Tsc-voo, Minister of 
Financc and close to Cliiang himself 
in importance. She is sister to 
Madame Ii. H. Kung; Kung is 
Minister of Industry, Commerce, andLabor, as well as being a direct de
scendant of Confucius. Sun Fo, only 
child of Dr. Sun and at present 
Minister of Railways, is Madame 
Suns step-son.. Against all these 
and the things they stand for 
Madame Sun set herself firmly in a 
statement issued in Hankow on July 
14, 1927, and she has never once 
since that time stirred from her 
position. The statement began thus:
11 We have reached a point 'where 
definition is ncccssar}' and where 
some members of the party executive 
arc so defining, the principles and 
policies of Dr. Sun Yat-scn that they 
seem to me to do violence ,to Dr. 
Suns ideas and ideals. Feeling thus, 
I must dissociate myself from active 
participation in carrying out the new 
policies of the party.
"In the last analysis, all revolt 
tions must be spcial revolutions, 
based upon fundamental changes iii 
society; otherwise it is not .a revolu
tion, but merely a change of governiment.
The statement then pointed out that 
Dr. Suns third vital principle; that 
of the "livelihood of  the people, 
was at stake in the existing crisis', 
and it was emphasized that' Dr. Sun 
had felt this principle' to be basic 
in the revolution.
".In this principle [said Madame 
Sun] we find liia analysis of social 
values nnd the place of the laboring 
and peasant classes defined. These 
classes become the basis of our 
strength in our struggle to over
throw imperialism, cancel the unequal 
treaties that enslave us, and effective
ly unify, the country. These arc the 
new pillars for the building up of a 
free China. . Without their support 
the Kuomintang, as a revolutionary 
party, bccomcs weak and chaotic andillogical in its social platform ;' With
out their support, political issues are 
vague. If wc adopt any policy that 
weakens these supports, we shake the 
very foundation of our party, betray 
the masses, and arc falsely loyal to 
our leader. ...
"Wc must not betray the people. 
Wc have built up in them a great
hope. They have placcd in Us " a 
great1 faith.'
And there is' a bit about- the backferoiiiid of Dr. Sun :
"Dr. Sun was, poor. Not until lie 
was /.fifteen years old did lie have 
shoes for liis feet, and lie lived in 
a hilly region where it is not easy 
to be a barefoot bo3'. His family, 
until lie and his brother were- grown, 
lived almost from hand to mouth 
in a hut. As a child lie ate the 
cheapest foodnot rice, for rice was 
too dear. His main nourishment 
was- sweet potatoes.'
"Many 'times Dr. Sun tolcl me that 
if was in those ' early days as a poor 
son (if :i 1)0(11- Pf.'isant family that he 
became a 'revolutionary. He was de
termined' that' the lot of the .Chinese 
peasant should not continue to he so 
wretched, that little boys in China 
should have shoes to wear and rice 
to Cat. For this ideal lie gave forty 
years of his life.
"Yet today the lot of the Chinese 
peasant 'is even more wretched than 
iii those days when Dr. "Sun was 
driven by his great sense of human 
wroligs into a life of rcvdliition. And 
today men who profess to follow his 
banifer talk of classes and think in 
(crihs '-of a revolution that would 
virtually disregard the sufferings  f 
those millions. .
In giving out ' the Hankow state
ment Madame Sun. was doing-a hard 
aiid dangerous thing which meant 
notf only /a risk-of life(which would 
mean little to i\ woman of such caliiherbut also the breaking of family 
tics and a generation of great enmity. 
Almost two years of voluntary exile 
followed the issuance of the Hankow 
declaration. Then in Berlin on May 
6, 1929, Madame Sun announced:
"I am proceeding to China for the 
purpose , of attending the removal of 
the remains of Dr. Sun Yat-scn to 
tiit Purple' Mountain where lie de
sired to be buried.
"In order to avoid any possible mis
understanding, I have to state that 1 
emphatically adhere to m3' declaration 
made at Hankow on July 14, 1927, 
in which I announced my withdrawal 
from active participation in the work 
of the< Kuomintang, on account of 
countcr-rcvolutionary policy and r.ctivities of .the central executive com
mittee.- . . ,
"It .must therefore be abundantly 
clear that my attendance, at the burial 
wall not mean and is npt to be in
terpreted as in any sense implying a 
modification or " reversal of my de
cision to abstain from a|i}r direct .or 
indirect work of the Kuomintang so 
long as its leadership is opposed to 
tlie fundamental .policies of Dr. Sun; 
namely, the policy of effective antiiniperialism,- the policies of co-operatim with Soviet-Russia and Workers 
'and Peasant poltc3r. When these poli
cies were the moving forces of the 
revolution we made rapid progress 
toward the realization of the prin
ciples. of the part3'. Now that the 
three policies have been discarded, 
our party has again become the tool 
of militarists and countcr-rcvolutionaries..........
In spite of her absence from the 
country, Madame otm had been elect
ed to the ccntral executive commit
tee of the Kuomintang at its handpicked congrcss of last spring, Upon 
her arrival at Peiping to start the 
long funeral journey from the West
ern Hills to the new mausoleum just 
outside the city walls of Nanking, 
"Madame Sun made it abundantly clear 
that she had 110 intention of lending 
her name and reputation to the 
government or part3\ Keeping her
self apart even from members of 
her family, she went through with the 
long and trying ceremonials, saw the
caskct safely deposited in its milliondollar resting place, .and returned to 
her house in the Rue Molierc in 
Shanghai. For spme time she main
tained silence. Then, on August 1, 
she fired a. shot which would have 
echoed throughout the country had 
not suppression, intervened. This 
took the form of a telegram sent 
to the Anti-Imperialist League in 
Berlin 011 the occasion of the inter
national anti-war. day. In; view of 
the Sino-Russian tension, the mes
sage was timcl. to say the least. 
Untimely appears to have been the 
word favored b3r various frenzied 
callers who presently came to ask 
repudiation, rctracti-ii, or at least a 
promise to be good in future. The 
telegram in question read:
While the oppressed nationalities 
today form a solid front against 
imperialist war and militarism, the 
reactionary Nanking Government is 
combining forces with the imperialists 
in' brutal repressions against the 
Chinese masses.
"Never lias the treacherous charac
ter of the countcr-rcvolutionary 
Kuomintang leaders been so shame
lessly exposed to the world as toda3'. 
Having betrayed the Nationalist rcvo: 
lution, they have inevitably degen
erated into imperialist tools and at
tempted to provoke war with Russia.
"But the Chinese masses, uhdauhled 
by repression and undeceived by ly
ing propaganda, "ill fight only 011 the 
side of revolution. Terrorism will 
cnly serve to mobilize still broader 
masses ai.d strengthen oiir determina
tion to triumph over the present 
bloody reaction. . .
Although her house is watched, al
though visitors to it arc followed, 
although the tick-tacking of licr type
writer at night has been mistaken for 
"a secret wireless to Moscow," 
Madame Sun is serene and without 
bitterness or dejection. Her feeling 
today is the feeling of two years 
ago, when* she wrote: "There is 110 
despair in my heart for the revolu
tion. My dishcartenmcnt is only for 
the path into Which some of, those 
who had been leading the revolution 
have strayed.

INTRA FRAT DORM
(Continued from Page Five) to 8. The first half the game was 
close, the winners being ahead
7-3, but they entered the second 
half with a flash of speed, and ran 
up a 20-5 score during this half. 
Rivet, for the winners,, was, the 
leading scorer, making six field 
goals and two. fouls.Running up -a. strong lead, the 
first half, the A- T. Os were able 
to down the Lambda Chi team by 
die score of 26-9. The.A. 1. Os 
v,ere ahead throughout and were 
never threatened. Buckley of the 
A. T. Os was the star of the 
game, accounting for 12 of his 
teams points.The Kappa Sigmas wlio had been 
undefeated, lost their first one by a 
close score to the. League, leading 
Beta Sigma Rlios by the score of 
18-15. At the end of. the half the 
winners were ahead by one point,
8-7., Klein and Goldberg of the 
winners, and Leslie and .T. l*lanagan of the losers were the out
standing players of the game.
McGill hall, last years winners 
of the cup, met their second . de
feat of the season, this time, at the 
hands of the Kappa Sigmals. The 
score Wets 19-9. Tlie Kappa Sigmas 
ran up a 10-4 score at the end of 
the half. L; Flanagan of the Kap
pa Sigmas and Walenta of. ,thcv 
McGill Hall outfit were the high 
scorers of their teams..
In a contest between two dorm 
tcanis; Henderson and Scobel Halls, 
ihc Henderson Hall .quintet. fp,und 
little difficulty in defeating their 
rivals by the score, of -40-6. Hen
derson hall, at the end of the half, 
was leading 17-3. Carson, forward 
for the. victors was high: scorer 
with six field goals to his credit.
The Phi Kappas continued their 
winning streak and no,scd out the 
Welch hall team 25-15.-- At the 
end- 'Of the half tliC3r were ahead 
13-6 and the Welch Hall- team 
found this lead too great to over
come. Ostrosky lead the team in 
scoring; . lie accounted for.'4 field 
goals. ^It is. interesting to note the 
groupings of. the teams in- the two 
leagues printed jn -todays Tartan. 
Due to a misplacement the third 
league schedule has. been omitted. 
However, it will appear in tli.e 
next issue.:In the American league the Beta 
Sigma Rlios having hurdled , their 
two most dangerous opponents, 
McGill and the Kappa Sigs seemed 
destined for the league, champion
ship unless the S. A. E.-s', the dark 
horse - of the* league, .can pull a 
surprise win. This ,.scems highly 
improbable, however, since , the' 
Betas seem to function as the 
smoothest team in all three leagues.
The Federal league looks to be 
a walk-away for the Beta. Theta 
Pis who have no serious competition.
Iii the National league the Phi
Kappas, and the Pi Kappa Alphas 
sport exceptionally well-balanced 
teams. They do not have a walk
away however, since the remainder 
of-the league is fairly strong. In 
fact if either of the above - men
tioned, teams do lose a game or 
two they are apt to find the Sig
ma Nus pressing them for the 
league leadership.
As in the past, the league cham
pions will participate, in the play
off series, the survivor receiving 
trophies and the right to play the 
Pitt' Champions at the close -of 
the season.
