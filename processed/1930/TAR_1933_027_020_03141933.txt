Dr. Baker Addresses 
Assembly at Carnegie 
Music Hall Today
Present Political Crisis 
In Germany Will Be 
Theme of Talk

CONDUCT MEETING

Reserved for Members 
O Honorarios
A special assembly at which Dr. 
Baker will tell about his visits to 
the German Universities will be 
held today at -11:45 in the Car
negie Music Hall. Dr. Baker will 
peak of the present political crisis 
in Germany and will emphasize the 
German University Students in
terest in politics, which he says 
is sadly lacking in our American 
techical schools.
This assembly'is held under the 
.-supervision of the student council 
whose president, Josef Lentz, 
will preside.
Special seats will be reserved 
for the live class lionoraries and 
members of Delta Skull, the Junior 
Honorary, will act ap ushers.
Dr. Baker made numerous perti
nent observations and acquired a 
great deal of first-hand information 
about the chaotic conditions exist
ing among the students in Ger
many today. The present student 
body is being trained in an at
mosphere of revolt. ... A con
siderable proportion of them are 
adherents of Hitler. He will not 
be able to satisfy their expecta
tions either as to their careers or 
as to their political ideals. They 
will be disappointed becaiise no 
one man can carry out all the 
promises that he has made . . . 
The students of today may, ten 
years hence, be socialists of an ex
treme type."
The mood of the German stu
dent, according to German profes
sors, has become since the war one 
of cheerlessness and gloom. The 
students are increasingly conscious 
of the political and less concerned 
with the academic side of their 
lives; according to Dr. Baker, aca 
dernic freedom has b.een curtailed 
by the high-handed methods which 
Hitler has allowed to bo used. I-Ie 
has urged the students to create 
a new nationalism, which has in
creased their feeling of im
portance.
"At present, Dr. Bnlcer says,

nance of the political leaders in

Dr. Frocht Originates New Method 
For Study of Stress Distribution
A new optical method for the 
study of stress distributions has 
heen originated by Dr. Max M. 
Frocht of the Mechanics Depart
ment. and is being developed in tho 
photo-elastic laboratory this yoar. 
The photo-elastic method, founded 
by David Browsher in 1S1G, makes 
it possible to obtain stress pat
terns of the loci of points of equal 
principal stress difference or of 
combined maximum shear. How
ever, in ordor to determine the 
two principal stresses themselves, 
additional data, usually obtained 
by a poiqt by point exploration 
of the changes in the thickness of 
the model, must be made. By means 
of Dr. Froclits new method it is 
possible to obtain a stress pattern 
of the whole model at once, repre: 
senting the loci of points along 
which the sums of the principal 
stresses are constant exactly anal'vpgoiis to the plioto-elastic fringes 
a^png which the stress-difference 
j3\?onstant. It should be noted 
that\this method does not replace 
pliotc'-elasticity but supplements it,
the two together making the op
tical method of stress analysis 
complete.
An interesting aspect of this 
method is found in the fact that 
it can be applied directly to models 
of structural material such as 
steel or copper, whereas photoolastlcity is inherently limited to 
transparent materials such as 
glass, celluloid, or bakelite, al
though the results are independent 
of the material as long as it is 
homogeneous. The now method is 
based upon the formation of interference-fringes on the surfaces of 
the model due to lateral changes in 
the dimensions of it
These interference fringe pat
terns may have other applications 
besides the one mentioned here.
Dr. Frocht reports the new meth
od and theory in a paper On the 
Application of Interference Fringes 
to Stress Analysis, which will ap
pear in an early issue of The Jour
nal of The Franklin Institute.

Mock World Economic Conference 
May Be Held on Campus Next Month
By DR. SAMUEL B. ROSS
Probably few events could have 
so Well illustrated the anachronism 
of our federal'"system of govern
ment as the banking crisis.
In point of economic change we 
have moved far in the last ninety 
years, but the organization of our 
government in its major structure 
remains practically unchanged. 
Since 1789 banking has grown from 
a neighborhood to a nation-wide 
and even a world-wide business 
and yet we still allow forty-eight 
different states to dominate about 
12,000 of the nations 18,590 banks 
as though banking were still a lo
calized and comparatively isolated 
undertaking.
Banking and industry are the 
warp and woof of our national 
economy. On this continuous
fabric which stretches from Maine 
to California, state lines do not set 
off divisions in function. Instead 
they, are arbitrary geographical 
boundaries designed for an agra
rian economy of the eighteenth 
century when transportation moved 
at the pace of stagecoaches and lo
cal life was to a high degree selfsufficient. Today the interdepend
ence of localities is an inexorable 
fact. Until now the structure of 
our government lias largely ignored 
it. In the fields of banking, child 
labor, womens minimum wage leg
islation and unemployment the ills 
have been accumulating.
The closing of the banks in the 
state of Michigan instead of isolat
ing the ills of a disintegrated sys
tem drained the deposits from the 
neighboring states. The banks of 
those states in turn withdrew their 
deposits from New York to meet 
the local demand. This passed on 
the shock to the New York banks 
over the national network of 
finance, and millions of depositors 
learned for the first time that 
banking was a national not a local 
enterprise.
A major shock in any locality is 
(Continued on Pago Four).
In the Tartan issue of March 7, 
the Y. M. Q. A. of Carnegie an
nounced that it contemplated spon
soring a World Mock Economic 
Conference on Carnegies campus. 
Twenty or more students will be 
needed to participate in the con
ference as planned.
Within the past few weeks, there 
has been a great deal of interest 
shown by' the istudents in the class
es and on the campus in national 
and world economic affairs. Since 
the conference as planned will be 
a general survey of the conditions, 
it will help the students interested 
in these affairs to collaborate their 
ideas on the various subjects. 'Such 
a conference will not only help to 
broaden the outlook and under
standing of those participating, of 
the largest problem facing the 
United States and the world today, 
but also any student interested 
enough to attend the sessions will 
derive many benefits.
If the plans materialize, the conT
ference would be held on Friday 
evening, April 21, from 7:30 to 
10:30 and Saturday, April 22, from 
8:30 a. m. to 5 p. m., with a short 
session Saturday evening for a re
port of a resolutions committee.' 
Each country represented will be 
given about thirty minutes for 
speech and discussion. The proba
ble topics would be "Gold and Fi
nance, Trade Barriers, and 
War Debts and Reparations. Tlie 
students will be divided into 
groups and each group will repre
sent one of -the major foreign na
tions. It is planned to place the 
reading and work of the partici
pants under the .direct'supervision 
of the faculty members of the de
partment of economics who have 
agreed to cooperate fully with the 
Y in making this conference a 
success.
[ All students interested in this 
conference are asked to meet with 
the committee on arrangements in 
the Y club room Tuesday, March

neering Foundation of New York 
City, and gives information con
cerning the field of engineering in 
general as well as the particular 
fields of civil, mining, metallurgic
al, mechanical, electrical, and 
chemical engineering.
Four other curricula of the Col
lege of Engineering, not represent

Debating Teams 
Will Be Formed 
By Fraternities
Intramural dobating, under the 
supervision of Professor Leo T. 
Lawler and a committee appointed 
by the Interfraternity Council, will 
be inaugurated shortly at Carne
gie. This committee, which 
is composed of three mem
bers, Charles Schatvet, chairman, 
Henry S. Carr, and Nathan L. 
Fleckenstine, has conferred with 
Mr. Lawler regarding the plans 
and has Come to an agreement on 
the schedule, rules, procedure, and 
subjects. .
Twelve fraternities have already 
signified their intention of partici
pating and it is hoped that the va
rious dormitories will take part. 
The teams, which are to be select
ed by the various houses in any 
way they see fit, will consist -of 
two members and an alternate.
A meeting will be held next 
Thursday at 12:30 in Room 104, 
Industries, for the purpose of mak
ing pairings for the elimination de
bates and for discussion of debat
ing practice. At that time the sub
ject will be announced.
The elimination contest will be
gin on May 29 and will proceed on 
successive days until ail the elim
ination debates are finished. Re
sultant winners will meet in semi
final and final debates to determine 
the winning team.
These debates, says Professor 
Lawler, provide additional oppor
tunity for students to participate 
in another extra-curricular activ
ity. The various z-epresentatives 
form the nucleus for a debating 
club which may provide a means 
for Carnegie to enter into colle
giate debating.
The judges will be selected from 
among the members of the faculty.

day, March 7, in the College of 
Fine Arts. On the same day E. 
Bradford Hollingsworth, sopho
more in the College of Engineer

chairman of the recent Arts Ball.
Mr. Hollingsworth is also promi

a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, 
social fraternity, and was a cross
country and, tennis man in his 
freshman year.
Beginning tonight and continu
ing through next Monday night, 
with a matinee Friday afternoon 
at 3:30, the Department of Drama 
will present under the direction of 
Chester Wallace "Alisons House, 
by Susan Glasspell, the Pulitzer 
Prize play of 1930-31. It is a play 
in three acts and was first present
ed December 1, 1930, by Eva Le 
Gallienne at the Civic Repertory 
Theater in New York City.
The story, around which the 
play is built, is supposed to be that 
of Emily Dickinson, the New Eng
land poet, about whose life there 
have been conjectures since there 
is little that is actually known. 
The period of the drama is Decem
ber 31, 1899, and the first and sec
ond scenes are set in the library 
of the old Stanhope homestead in 
Iowa, on the Mississippi. The third 
scene is in Alisons room after the 
death of one of the characters.
The plot is an absorbing story 
with tremendous human interest. It 
tells of the family of Alison Stan
hope, famous American poet, who 
has been dead for eighteen years. 
Her old home, rich in traditions 
and filled with memories, is about 
to be sold just at the close of the 
nineteenth century. Her sister, 
her brother, and her brothers fam
ily gather In the old house to take 
their last farewell and to share in 
the distribution of the precious be
longings, which have been pre
served by her aged sister, Agatha. 
Agatha however, dies with the dy
ing'century, leaving a secret which 
she has guarded faithfully since 
Alisons death. The secret Is em
bodied in a series of manuscript 
poems which reveal the inner life 
of the poet, and in seeking to keep 
this from the eyes of a new and 
prying generation, Agatha nearly 
destroys the house Itself.
Miss Glasspell. the writer of the 
play and an active participant jn 
the Little Theater movement in 
America, is very much interested 
in the work of the drama school. 
She would be here for the opening 
performance were it not for the 
fact that at the present time she 
is in Mexico. She is a personal 
friend of Mr. Wallace who is di
recting the following cast:

Made Regular Social 
Event Under Council
Letter From Arts
Ball Committee
AttendanceTo Be Limited 
To Arts Students And 
Arts Alumni
To the Editor:
Since the controversy be
tween the Arts Ball Committee 
and Student Council has been 
settled with satisfaction to both 
sides, I believe it only fair to 
the committee to remove the 
blame from its shoulders.
The whole matter hinged 
upon questions asked by the 
committee and answered by the 
Student Council. Question: 
Upon what does Student Coun
cil base its request for compli
mentary tickets? Answer: Pre
cedence. Question: How many 
shall we give to Student Coun
cil? Answer: Not how many
you will give but how many we 
will take.
We feel that the charge of 
lack of co-operation was not 
well founded and that misman
agement was hardly the term 
for the few mistakes which we 
made. However, through arbi
tration, we have arrived at an 
understanding mutually gratify
ing.
Signed:
CHARLES L. DIETZ,
Chairman.
Students Give 
Psychological 
Survey Tests
Case Histories and Tests 
Will be Used in Giving 
Vocational Aid
Members of the junior and sen
ior' classed in the Department of 
Industrial Education are making a 
pliychologlcal survey of nearly 500 
students enrolled in the courses 
for employed young men and wo
men conducted by the Downtown 
Y. M. C. A. and the Central Y. W. 
C. A.
Those courses are offered to high 
school graduates who are unem
ployed, and who wish to continue 
their education. No tuition fee is 
necessary to enroll in the courses 
and classes are conducted in any 
subjects for which there is suffi
cient demand. Credit will not be 
given for any subjects taken. The 
large number of young men and 
women who are enrolled In the 
courses offer the members of Pro
fessor Cleetona classes in Voca
tional Education and Guidance an 
{excellent opportunity to conduct 
an .intensive survey.
The individual case histories of 
the unemployed students will be 
compiled by officials of the Y. M 
C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. Carne
gie students will administer psy
chological tests for the purpose of 
determining the mental ability, 
personality traits, and vocational 
aptitude of the students enrolled 
in the courses.
Results of tho tests and the 
knowledge obtained from the casi 
histories will be used in advising 
the students on subjects such as 
choosing a vocation, correcting 
personality defects, and vocational 
preparations. These results will 
also be use'd by the Y. M. and Y. 
W. C. A. in classifying students 
and admitting them to certain 
courses.
Two First Mentions 
Received on Project
In. the recent judgment of the 
Class "B Design IV project, First 
Mentions were awarded to Francis 
OConnor Church and Arsene A. 
Rousseau. Carnegie students were 
also awarded thirteen Mentions 
which is an unusually large num
ber for any single problem. Tho 
title of the problem was A Ferry 
Wharf.
UNANIMOUS VOTE 
OF COUNCIL GIVEN
Council Constitution Change 
Recommcndcd to Next 
Years Council
The Arts Ball has been re-iustated as a rgular social event 
under Student Council.
The re-instatement was made by 
unanimous vote of the Council at 
a special meeting last Thursday 
evening after agreement for settle
ment had been made with the rep
resentatives of the Arts Senate. 
Re-instatement had been provided 
for by the motion which abolished 
the Ball two weeks ago today, pro
vided 300 Arts students would peti
tion for its re-instatement.
In conjunction with the rein
statement' motion, another was 
unanimously passed which recom
mends to next years Council that 
the matter of complimentary tick
ets be placed in the hands of the 
Arts Senate. This recommenda
tion entails a change in the con
stitution of the Council.
The re-lnstatement motion reads: 
I move that the Arts Ball be re

Prof. Howell Collaborates on Study 
Of Emergency Relief Activities
Professor James W. Howell, of 
the Department of Economics, has 
collaborated with Major Philip 
Mathews, of the Bureau of Govern
mental Research, and Dr. Francis 
D. Tyson, of the University of 
Pittsburgh, in making a compre
hensive report on the activities of 
the Allegheny County Emergency 
Association. This organization
came into existence in February, 
1931, to meet the unemployment 
crisis in the Pittsburgh district. ^ 
In dealing with the unemploy
ment situation in Alleghny County, 
the report emphasized the fact that 
there was present a lagging 
tendency in the unemployment 
trend. Marked decreases in em
ployment did not occur here until 
the fall of 1930, although the de
cline appeared in other parts of 
the country much earlier, and sub
sequent decrease in employment 
have been slightly less than for the 
country as a whole. This lagging 
tendency was explained in part by 
the lack of industrial diversifica
tion in the Pittsburgh district, and
in part by the plan of staggered 
employment which was adopted 
here more generally than else
where.
According to the report, there 
were 89,000 persons out of work in 
the county in November, 1930; A 
year later the number had in
creased to 101,000 and two years 
later to 210,000. At the present 
time about 40 per cent of those 
normally employed are out of 
work. By October 1932, the index 
of payrolls had fallen below 40.
The work of the Emergency As
sociation was divided into three 
parts: work relief, diroct relief, 
and long-range planning. The 
work relief program was made pos
sible through work projects ob
tained from local government 
agencies and semi-public institu
tions. The guiding principle in the 
selection of work projects was 
that they would be of a perma
nently useful nature but could not 
be undertaken at that time unless 
the labor were paid for by the 
Emergency Association. No pro
ject could be of a profit making

In India, the fakirs present a spectacle to tourists. 
Two lovely performers break bottles and lamp 
chimneys before the eyes of the audience,and throw 
the jagged pieces into a box already filled with 
broken glass. They step barefooted into the box 
and do an Oriental dance'in the glass without in
jury.
EXPLANATION:
The performers toughen their feet in a strong so
lution of alum water arid thoroughly rub them 
with pulverized resin before they appear. They 
throw the freshly broken glass around the edges of 
the platform. The glass on which they actually do 
dance is very thick, heavy, and filed or ground so 
that the sharp edges are rounded off. The girls 
just pretend to dance on the sharp glass.

Sylvia Waide, the Volleyball 
Manager, will have charge of the

everyone to have luncb and make 
a one-thirty class on time. Thats 
a big promise, especially for those

To Cop Again; Ilave 
Brilliant Record
Carnegie Tech still has one gold
en opportunity to change a seem
ingly mediocre basketball season 
into one of overwheming glory. 
This Friday at the Stadium Pavil
ion they face for the second time 
their old jinx, Dr. H. C. Carlson. 
For the past three years it lias 
seemed to all hardened observers 
of the game that the Tartans had a 
somewhat superior team to the 
Panthers, but each time the Plaid 
has come out on the short end of 
a very, very close score. This 
time the Pitt cohorts enter the 
game as overwhelming favor
ites, but the Hannum machine has 
at times shown unexpected power 
this year, and Max is hoping and 
possibly praying that his boys will 
have one of those good evenings. 
If they are onlook out, Doc, but 
if they are off, you can merely re
lax and watch a debacle.
Just what combination will play 
against the gold and blue is open 
to conjecture. In the last two or 
three games there have a couple 
of combinations that have looked 
plenty good. One of these is to 
place Jagnow and Silverman at 
the forwards, Smith-at center, and 
Fergus and Rigg at the guard 
posts. Another scrappy combina
tion is Smith and Jagnow at the 
forwards, Edelblut at center, and 
Fergus and Silverman at guard.
Pitts cagers have enjoyed one 
of \ the most successful seasons in 
several years. The one blot one 
their record seems to be a double 
setback a_t the hands of Duquesne, but after seeing the Dukes 
perform one begins to wonder if 
the amateur team exists that can 
stop the Davies machine. Pitt has 
split with Purdue and Notre Dame, 
and they have defeated strong 
teams from almost every part of 
the county.

Fergus Seores 23 Points 
In Conference Tilt; 
Score is 43-41
Pittsburgh basketball teams 
seem to have little or no ldck in 
playing the national capital. A 
few weeks ago Pitt, apparently win
ners of the Intercollegiate Basket

expected defeat, at the hands of 
the Georgetown University squad, 
and then to tOD it off the Hoyas 
stopped Max Hannums Carnegie 
.Tech club there Saturday by a 
43-41 count. When they played in 
Pittsburgh earlier in the year, the 
Washington boys looked like fish 
for either of the above named out
fits, but on their own ball park 
they are evidently a vastly differ
ent club.
Mr. James Campbell Fergus, a 
redhaired gentleman of some 
notoriety 011 the Tartan campus, 
was by far the most outstanding 
man on the floor. By far the 
flashiest floorman in the confer
ence, he entered new fields for a 
guard by accounting for no less 
than 23 points - in one evening. 
Nine baskets and five fouls com
prised this total.
Local loop fans were treated to 
one of the most exciting games of 
the year last Tuesday when the 
Skibos nosed out the classy 
Geneva club, 37-35, in an overtime

victory seemed very sweet indeed

Boxing Meets 
Cancelled for 
This Season
Eligibility Difficulties 
Influence A. A. in 
Drastic Action
Graduate Manager " B ii d d y  
Overend has wisely decided to can
cel the remaining boxing matches 
for the current season. The ab
surdity of allowing a game though 
inexperienced group of boys to 
compete in such a highly individu
alized sport was never more clear
ly shown than in the recent Car
negie-West Virginia match. - To 
complete the. schedule with the 
present array of green material 
was to invite permanent injury to 
the Tartan participants and perma
nent harm to the sport itself.
The spectators at the West Vir
ginia match experienced no enjoy
ment at seeing their fellow, stu
dents stand up and risk all kinds 
of dangerous punishment merely 
that the existing schedule might 
run its course. College boxing, 
when skilled contestants are com
peting, is a healthy and desirable 
sport to have but Mr. Overend and 
Coach iSesto realized the futility 
of imposing upon the school spirit 
and physical well-being of their 
boys and have therefore elimin
ated the remaining engagements 
with Pitt, W. & J. and Bucknell.
It was through Mr. Over
end that Eastern Intercol
legiate Boxing Conference came 
into being. Buddy conceived of 
and instigated the necessary oper
ations which brought the Confer
ence into existence, and also spon
sored its first tournament in the 
gym last spring.
Exams Wreck Team
The sport caught on quickly 
around sphool and plansvwere laid 
by the Athletic Association for 
expansion of the Conference mem
bership to include some of the 
larger Eastern schools.
The current boxing team was 
the victim of one of tho most com
plete knockouts ever administered 
by mid-semester grades. With an 
extremely promising squad and a 
wonderful chance at the cham
pionship, Coach Sesto saw his en
tire first team with one exception, 
eliminated via the exam route. Plans 
for reorganization were immediate
ly laid and the students responded 
nobly, but after two disastrous 
starts the boxing team was dis
banded untilnextyear.____________

Alpha Sigs and Belas 
Top Their Leagues 
With No Losses
WITH THE INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL champlonahip playoffs but 
a little more than two weeks away, there seems to be greater activity 
by competing teams than ever before. Nearly half a dozen teams arc 
striving to get a look In on tho playoff games, and. before the week is 
out there arc going to be several disappointed teams. In only one 
leaguo is the championship sewed upthat being the Federal League. 
Since tho Betas defeated the Senior Architects in the opening game 
by one point, they havo had little trouble with their remaining con
tests. In the American League, the Alpha Sigma Phir. have a perfect 
scoro so far, but there arc several other teams hounding them close 
and trying to shake them down from their perch at the top of the 
league. In the National League, tho race is closer than in either of 
the other two. The Kappa Sigs and the-Theta Xis have each won five 
contests, and each seem to have a strong team. Well, the outcomc of 
that league championship will bo determined Wednesday night at 8:30 
when these two teams meet.
WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING OF INTRAMURAL SPORTS let me re
mind you Greeks that there aro several other sports Bneaking up 011 
you and you had better beware or you will be lost in tho hustle and 
hustlo of tho last minute activity. First 011 the list is the wrestling 
contest which begins 011 March 27, and lasts to March 31. All entries 
for this meet must be in by 5:30 on Thursday, March 16. All men 
who expect to enter the contest must be out for practice for at least 
two weeks before the opening day. This is to help each man get into 
fair condition and to make it more even for everyone concerned. A 
cup will be given this year to t>a team winner the same as was done 
last year.
The Interfralernity swimming meet begins the week after the wrest
ling with the trial heats being held 011 April 3, 5, 7. and the finals on the 
tenth. All entries for this must, be in by 4:30 Friday, March 24. The 
rules this year are slightly different from those of last year. In the 
trials, the winners of'first and second places will qualify for the finals, 
but the points gained ill tho trial heats will count 011 the final score. 
There will be a meeting of the managers of the swimming team in 
tho trophy room today at 5:00 o'clock.
Entries for the Softball League must be in by March 2-1, to enable 
tho drawings to be made at the earliest possible date. It is expected 
that the rules will be changed somewhat this year; so there will be a 
meeting of team representatives 011 March 28 in the trophy room. * * * *
THE TARTAN BASKETBALL TEAM closes its very difficult cam
paign this week when it meets West Virginia here on Tuesday, and 
Pitt in the Pitt Stadium Friday night. The chances for scoring a tie 
with Pitt in the Intercollegiate Basketball Conference were eliminated 
Saturday night when the Plaid five lost to Georgetown in Washington 
by a 43-41 score. It was a close game throughout but the Hoyas man
aged to eke out a two-point victory. Co-captaln Angus Fergus scored 
enough points to win most any game alone, but it was not quite 
enough for this one. Red accounted for nine baskets and five free 
tosses for a total of twenty-three points.
Probably the most interesting and exciting game played here this 
year was the one on Tuesday night with Geneva in which the Skibos 
scored a 37-35 overtime victory. Although it was far from a well 
played game, it was so exciting that many a hair turned grey In the 
last few minutes of the game. The Tartans were away behind at the 
half but they started going in the second half, brought the score even 
and then forged Into the lead only to have it evened up just before 
the final whistle blew. The extra period was even worse than the 
game Itself with the lead which the Tartans had gained early in the 
five minutes being cut to nothing, but two buckets just before the 
whistle blew sewed up the contest. Bob Smith and Cliff Aultman were 
the stars of the game. Jim Fergus for once had his hands full guard
ing the Geneva flash.
the CAME wMi PITT FRIDAY should bo Interesting despite the 
fact that the Panthers havo already copped one contest this year. The 
Tartans were at. their worst'against tho city rivals in their first en
gagement, so they will bo out for blood this time. Not since'back In 
:i.A27 have the Plaid forces booh unable to gain enough points to come 
out ahead against their deadly rivals, and this will be the last chance 
this year. Pitt has the hotter record and will be the overwhelming 
favorite but favorites moan 111,tie in one of those games. Tho fact that 
the Panthers play 011 tlioir homo floor will bo tho greatest advantage 
for thorn. Tho stadium floor is one of the most; difficult In this vicinity 
to play 011.
GRADUATE MANAGER OVEREND noted very wisely when ho can
celled the remaining boxing matches of the season. With the fairly 
experienced squad which opened up the cnmpnlqn with a victory over 
Duquesne, the schedule could have been completed with good success, 
but Ineligibility of most of the team 'meant* the shoving of Inexperi
enced men Into the lineup. The results of two meets under these con
ditions prompted Mr. Overond to cancel the sohedule. Ho felt that It 
would bo a detriment to the game as well as to the men themselves 
If they wore allowed to meet more crafty and skilled opponents.
SINCE IT HAS BEEN DEEMED NECESSARY and advisable that 
intorfrafonilty contract, bridge should go on the sports pago, wo think 
If fitting that some mention of if should bo made In this column. 
,1'lvon your scrlbo has fallen so low as to become a member of one of 
tho loams, and Judging from his shins If would havo boon much tho 
wiser plan for him t.o steer dear of such a sporr,.
But after two weeks of the parlor pastime, 1 am convinced that, it; 
belongs on this psgo because if carries the necessary requisites for any 
sport. It lakes lots of condition (of a certain kind), quite a bit of luck, 
and....inueh-rvory much self control.
Tho material necessary to equip a team would even startle our 
Graduate Manager Mr. Ovorond', and put the A. A. into bankruptcy. 
After studying tho matter thoroughly 1 havo prepared a list or neces
sary Items for any team. They aro: four men, eight chairs, two tables, 
four packs of cards, a hall the size of Madison Square Gardens to 
accommodate all the willing kibitzers, one carload of cigarets, ton 
gross of matches, several pounds of Chase and Sanborns coffee, four 
pairs of shin guurds, one bale of cotton for stuffing the ears, two ex
pert accountants for keeping score, one adding machine, plenty of 
spare time, and a set of signals, one dozen Victor recording records 
to record the discussion following the match so that it could be played 
regularly for. the week following tho match.
After the above has been acquired all that is necessary Is to learn 
how to play the game.
With tho champions of two of 
the leagues practically decided, 
the big contest lies between the 
Kappa Sigs and the Theta Xis for 
the title in the National League. 
Both teams undefeated they will 
moot for the decision tomorrow 
night at 8:30 for the deciding 
game.
The Alpha Sigma Phi team leading the A/nerican leftgue will have 
to win two tough games to retain 
an unblemished record as they 
come up against the Delts and the 
Sigma Nub yet. The Pi K. As 
obligingly defeaLed the Delts last 
week in a thrilling game which 
leaves the Alpha Sigs 011 top of 
tho pile.
The Betas practically have a 
space cleared off on the mantel for 
their cup as they have only one 
more game to play and that 
against the cellar team in the 
league.

Scarab Honorary Hears 
Architect After Lunch
The Night Thistle Staff urges all 
possible graduates to make a spe
cial effort to have their pictures 
taken this week in accordance with 
the instructions which were mailed 
to them.
It is the earnest . dsire of the 
staff to have this years annual 
contain a picture of every night 
graduate, and as the charge for 
the setting and cut is very small, 
the student is urged not to allow 
this to interfere with the publica
tion of his graduation picture.
The staff takes this opportunity 
to solicit orders for this years 
Thistle. The size of the annual 
has been enlarged, and the editor 
promises something new in the 
way of setup. Every graduate will 
be proud to have one of these in 
his library for future reference. 
Mail your orders to Mr. A. J. Lois, 
Business Manager, Box 137 C. I. T. 
Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Members of Scarab, architec
tural honorary fraternity, had an 
informal gathering and luncheon at. 
tho^ Commons last Thursday with 
Edward B. Lee, noted Pittsburgh 
architect, as guest, speaker., In a 
brief after-dinner talk Mr. Lee dis
cussed depressions of the past. 
Twonty-tive members and Mr. Rob
ert Schmertz in the capacity of 
faculty adviser were present. 
Scarab intends, in the near future, 
to hold another dinner with a 
noted speaker to which all the ar
chitects will be invited.
At the hist meeting of the Wo
men's Glee Club, nominations for 
next, years officers were made. The 
election of the otlicers will take 
place Tuesday afternon, March 14, 
in the assembly room of Margaret 
Morrison at 1:30 p. m. The nomin
ations are as follows: manager, 
Evelyn Gamble 34, Gertrude E. 
Landis 34. Evelyn L. Williams 
34; assistant manager, Gertrude. 
Iv. Breakstone "35, Catherine M.

The student body is to be con
gratulated for its fine support of 
student activities under the present 
conditions. Reduced income from 
activities fees due to reduced reg
istration struck a hard blow at the 
committees in charge of activities 
in the various colleges. However, 
the scale of the affairs given so 
far, instead of being reduced, has 
been enlarged.
New ideas, and more lavish dec
orations have added materially to 
the cost of the night social affairs. 
And it lias been gratifying to see 
that the student body has risen to 
the occasion and shown its appre- j 
iation by continued support.
The student body owes a great 
deal of pleasant enjoyment ob
tained at these night school affairs 
to the voluntary workers who pre
pare for them. The students are 
to be congratulated for giving these 
workers the encouragement they 
have by turning out for the dances 
and smokers as they have. It is 
to be hoped that this show of ap
preciation and support will con
tinue. The better each affair is at
tended the better success the next 
one will be. The increased rev
enue. and good encouragement, 
have beneficial effects on those 
who .do all the hard work attend
ant to arranging one of these af
fairs.
Nu Sigma Alpha Holds 
Annual Meeting Sat.
The Department of Drama ex
tends to the night school an invi
tation to attend the weekly mati
nee performances that the drama 
students are giving in the Carne
gie Union throughout the semester. 
There have been many requests 
recently by the students for tick
ets to the performances in the 
Little Theater, but as the demand 
for these greatly exceeds the sup
ply, the department has planned to 
supplement these by giving Friday 
matinees of the Little Theater 
plays? and performances in Carne
gie Union of groups of one-act 
plays. There are no tickets of ad
mission required for these plays 
and it is hoped that a great many 
students will attend them. This 
week there are- two matinees in 
Carnegie Union, beginning at 3:30 
and presenting several Shakesperean scenes and a group of oneact plays. On Friday there will 
matinee of Alisons House in the 
Little Theater at 3:30.
Many of the students of the col
leges of Industry and Engineering 
have broken away from the monot
ony of their own schools and have 
invaded the Arts school to see S.CDN 
art students live. These expedi
tions have been anything from 
mere walks through the building 
and peering-into studios to attend
ing functions intended for Arts 
students only.
I have always wanted to see a 
play at the Little Theater from be
hind stage and finally got the op
portunity when a friend invited me 
to tsee a performance of The 
Ivory Door" by sitting up in the 
flies or else standing behind one 
end of- the steel curtain.
I got to the back stage entrance 
about eight o'clock, and threaded 
my way among dramats who were 
lounging around and talking. The, 
stage itself was empty. Soon somecalled out the time Two more min
utes. for curtain. Where is every
one? A bewliiskered fellow in 
kings attire -strode out upon the 
stage followed by a girl dressed in 
boys clothes of some by-gone pe
riod. They took their places on 
the throne in the room and looked 
at each other with expressions that 
they were to assume^when the cur
tain went up.
Action Starts Suddenly
Steel going up, a voice hissed. 
Suddenly, through the darkness a 
spot flashed and reArealed a girl 
crouching on the stage. Once there 
was a kingthen the light flick
ered out, the girl disappeared into 
the darkness, and tile curtain went 
up for the prologue.
It was interesting to watch the 
players standing around back stage 
having a good time, and then see 
them a few minutes later trans
form tliemselves into the .charact
ers they were to represent.
Changing scenery was a night
mare to me with the curtain 
down, some of the scenery starts 
skyward. Large pieces were push
ed back, and others unfolded and 
pushed into place. In a few min
utes, it was all over. The crew 
worked like lightning.
The end of the play brought the 
act curtain down, and then the 
steel curtain. Most of the cast 
had disappeared above, and I fol
lowed. Towels covered with grease 
paint and dirt were discarded and 
pounced upon by crew girls and 
carried away to the ward robes.
Bits of talk about almost evei*3rthinggood audience>so and so 
were therewell see you at Sldbo 
got your History of the Theater 
finished?and sooh all but the 
very slow were dressed after a 
fashion and had left.
Thus ended my peep behind the 
scenes in the Little Theater.
Speaking over radio station 
KDKA recently in a program spon
sored by the Pennsylvania State 
Education Association. Prof. Glen 
U. Cleeton, head of the Department 
of Industrial * Education, flayed 
those who seek to reduce taxes by 
slashing the budget and payrolls of 
our educational system. Suggest
ing that "Those.who are critical of 
school costs would do well to study 
school expenditures and their re
lation t.o other public and private 
disbursements before arriving at. 
conclusions, Professor Cleeton 
urged that the tree of, American 
education be saved from the illdirected axe of the tax cutter.
Observing that school costs 
have increased rapidly, organised 
groups, seeking economy in govern
ment have frequently asserted 
th&t present school costs are exor
bitant. To explain this increase 
in operation costs Professor Clee
ton pointed out. The enrollment 
of elementary and high schools has 
increased 34 per cent. Regularity 
of attendance lias increased G5 
per centand the average length 
of the school year has increased 
nine per cent. Twenty years ago 
many schools were make-shift. 
buildings, which were little more 
than unsanitary flretraps. The 
school plant of today in most com
munities is a modern, well-equipper, fireproof structure. Building 
and maintenance costs have in
creased 25 per cent. Increase in 
the cost of schools today over the 
cost of maintaining schools twenty 
years ago can l?e accounted for 
largely in the improvement in serv
ice rendered and for the greater 
demands for training with which 
the schools are confronted.
Employing statistics  Professor 
Cleeton ridiculed the Idea,that pub
lic funds were being squandered. 
In Tour of our .large statesPenn
sylvania, New York, Ohio, and 
Michiganstate and local taxes 
for maintaining civil government 
exceed in sum the total amount 
spent for public school education 
in all forty-eight, states. Figures 
show that we are spending moro 
paying for past wars and prepar
ing for future wars than the en
tire cost of the educational pro
gram of the nation. Scaling down 
figures we find that "for evory 
hundred dollars rocelved in in
come leSB than four are paid out 
as taxes for public oducatlon. 
During the year wo spend four and 
one-half times as much to operate 
the family autojnoblle, twice as 
much for tobacco and amuse
ments, and one and one-half times 
as much for insurance aa wo pay 
for the education of our son a and 
daughters. Professor Cleeton chailongos the critics of school costs 
Are our public schools loss Im

On March l'J the Mayfair Bridge

may be played from 4 to G. Those 
desiring to make reservations

Recent Art Show 
Draws Fire from 
Local ExhibitorsDIDJA NOTICEFirst its Pittsburgh that cries 
about the Art Exhibitiona sort 
of annual affair held for the slingers of the paint on paper or can
vass. Sort of funny name for that 
artistic temperature which moti
vates those gifted people known as 
artists. But once their enthusiasm 
is stirred up there is no telling 
where they will stop.  Some disa
gree with the choices of the award
ers, suppose that -name will vdo as 
good as any, for after all what do 
judges do but make awards. Then 
others think that the show is, 
what shall I call it? No, I am not 
up on hesthetics so I better let 
those who are qualified give the 
verdict.
THAT since we have been 
dealt a new deal we are all on 
the same basis, everybody's 
broke.
THAT the after effects of 
that famous Arts Ball were so 
great that the bank holiday 
seemed insignificant in compari
son.
THAT our spy No. 777 was 
informed the other night that 
those remarks concerning the 
Industries boy and girl were 
cruel. Accept our apologies, 
please, but remember, me and 
Winchell have our eyes on both 
of you. We see all, know all, 
and hear all.
THAT when you see Pop 
Manson confidentially whisper
ing in someones e*ar its a sure 
sign that he has more than just 
an arm up his sleeve, and from 
the smile on his listeners face 
it must be some story.
, THAT our campus guardians, 
those grey horses on the drive, 
are doing quite well despite ad
verse weather, moratoriums 
and lack of publicity.
THAT Lent seems to have 
put a crimp on all social activ
ities both on and off the cam
pus, or is there another reason?
THAT a certain he-man over 
in the arts school seems to 
have made quite a hit with the 
fair ones these days but is hold
ing up very well under the 
strain.
THAT Dame Rumor has it 
that a contest for night stu
dents only is to be announced 
soon. Rest assured that well 
dish you all the dirt fresh from 
the heap.
THAT they are going to take 
pictures of the night graduates 
for the Thistle soon. If you are 
one of this group practice up on 
your favorite grin and.come out 
and get shot.
THAT that's that and Ill be 
seenya.
The Womens Athletic Associa
tion is planning a swimming party 
to be held Saturday evening. April 
1, from S to 10 oclock in the gym
nasium pool. As an addod feature 
of tho evening there will be aquatic 
performances by the mens swim
ming team. Card tables will bo 
arranged for those who prefer play
ing bridge to swimming.
Convparo this to private schools 
which offer a similar service at a 
cost ranging anywhere between 
$300 and $1,500 a year. Such dif
ferences in cost suggest that our 
public schools are well managed 
financially.
The relation of teachers salaries 
to the total taxes is so small that 
even a drastic reduction in sala
ries would savo only two-thirds of 
each tax dollar. Salary reductions 
would benefit the taxpayer little 
and would work hardships on many 
teachers. The teacher is seldom 
overpaid. Teachers salaries have 
been reduced in many communities 
not to lessen the burden of the tax
payers but to prevent actual clos
ing of schools. As a public serv
ant tho teachers contribute liber
ally to community welfare needs. 
To cut tho salaries of our teachers 
Professor Cleeton believes would 
be a crime. Why rob Peter to pay 
Paul?
Closing his broadcast Professor 
Clooton said, What most of our 
public schools need Is not. taxi re
duction, not abrogation of exist
ing legislation, but financial as
sistance which will make It possi
ble for them to carry on the worth
while work which is boing accom
plished under difficulties.
Professor Cleetons broadcast 
was printed, in full in tho March 
Issue ol! Education Bulletin, the 
official publication of tho Ponnsylvanla State Education AHBOclatlpn.
The regular annual meeting of 
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity will be 
held this Saturday evening at tho 
Carnegie Inn on Woodlawn ave
nue. From the returns which are 
being mailed in, a large turnout of 
membership is indicated at the 
nieeting.
Preparations are now under way 
for the spring dance which the fra
ternity will hold on April 1. The 
popular Thistle Hall has been re
served for the occasion and the in
vitations have been sent out. 
Since this is an open dance held by 
the fraternity, members have tho 
privilege of extending invitations 
to their friends to attend the party, 
which is always a colorful affair.
Purdue University students are 
being asked to enter tho 1933 Pur
due Egg and Chick show. The en
trance requirements are very strict. 
banning anyone who does not 
oat, or market eggs._______________ .
The next thing in the arts line is 
the Arts Ball. We certainly are 
having our attention called to the 
big hop which took plilce a couple 
of weeks ago. I am finding out 
that some did crash the ball, and 
there I was trying my might to 
get in and the best I could do was 
the post affair. No. I didnt go to 
that, I simply fooled them and 
stayed away. From all the recom
mendations which have been made 
after the affair is over, one would 
think that they were going to 
have another one next year, but 
the head lines say Arts Ball is 
Abolished. Im a bear for head 
lines so we shall see wlien the 
time comes.

 The present sad state of the 
economic situation has caused 
many educational institutions, Car
negie among them, to retrench and 
economize. An earlier article on 
this page requested the students 
to conserve supplies, and to avoid 
careless handling of apparatus and 
equipment so as to avoid future re
placement costs as far as possible.
It has recently been necessary 
to dispense the paid problemcheckers in some departments, and 
all departments are earnestly re
questing their students to econ
omize as much as possible. The 
faculty does not make unreason
able demands. Economies that 
would affect the quality of the stu
dents work have " been avoided. 
All they ask is care in -the use of 
school equipment, and .avoidance 
of unnecessary waste.
It is up to the students. If they 
are willing to accept the conditions 
of a reduced teaching staff, in
creased tuition fees, and strict 
rules governing the use of equip
ment and supplies, they need only 
disregard the requests of their de
partments.
The student body should coop
erate all possible with the faculty 
in reducing operating expenses, 
and be as careful and conserving 
as possible in, accordance with 
good work.

A Satisfactory Settlement
Till) re-instatenie'nt of the Arts Bull us a regular social 
event under Student Council by a unanimous vote o the body 
is indicative of the general attitude of the Council towards the 
Arts Ball as a traditional campus function. The drastic steps 
taken by Council two weeks ago were the result of seemingly 
unnecessary misunderstandings about the relationship of ilie 
Arts Senate and the Student Council regarding the Ball. The 
fairness of the Council towards the Arts students is revealed in 
the abolishing motion which provided for re-instatement on the 
social calendar of the Council if 300 Arts students would peti
tion for its re-iustatement.
The sympathy of the Council towards the Ball as a tradi
tion. (oi the campus and its attitude toward the Arts students 
as a group is further indicated in a motion passed on January 
10 which transferred the profits from the Ball of two years ago 
to Dean ICeeble to be used for a student loan fund for Arts stu
dents. The Council was in no way obligated to take this ac
tion ; the money could have been held in reserve to pay off 
deficits of future Arts Balls, should any occur. This action 
was taken in spite of the fact that the present economic condi
tions made it somewhat dubious at the time as to whether or 
not the Ball bis year would be a financial success. If there 
had been a deficit, it would have had to been met from the gen
eral .Student Council funds, which means that the profits, if 
any, from other social, functions on the campus and the funds 
paid to the Council by publications and by students through 
the activities fees would be used to meet the deficit. If such 
a condition should exist, it means that appropriations for pub
lications, musical organizations, and the like would necessarily 
have to bo cut to adjust the budget of the Council. A. deficit: 
resulting from any social function efi'eels the entire student 
body, since funds which are appropriated for other things must 
be used to meet it. When these facts arc realized it is apparent 
why the Counoil is concerned with the eloso eo-.opcrnt.ion of 
every committee and manager of every organization on the 
campus.
The Student Council is bound by a eonstilution to exercise 
certain authorities and tlio members of the Council would bo 
shirking their duties if they did not assort the powers granted 
thorn, h'rom the actions of the Council in other matters, if is 
evident thill any change in the constitution which is warranted 
would receive file fullest, consideration. Tile constitution formed 
in 19211, amended to its present form in 1920, is in 110 respect a 
product of any one council group, and it is obvious that the 
officers of the Council are obliged by the fact that they have 
licen elected lo the ofllcerHhips they hold lo perform the duties 
tin trusted to them.
It the Council is t.o be respected by the student body, flic 
group must base its actions upon the constitution handed down 
to it by preceding councils. 1C any exceptions are to be made 
1,0 the constitution, the only possibly channel is through amend
ment:. The fact that the. Council unanimously went on rcooxd 
as favoring a change in the constitution which will grant, a 
special privilege in the ease of the Arts Ball because of the fiadition behind the event shows that the body is disposed to act 
in accordance with the best interests of 111e student body. 
There is no reason why ibis change could not, have been made 
before the Arts Bail if it had been desired at the time.
The Council 1ms taken steps to clarify the whole situation 
in an endeavor to eliminate any recurrence of friction be
tween future committees and.councils.
The Arts students should appreciate file stand of the Coun
cil in this matter, inasmuch as the Arts Senate representatives 
have expressed their satisfaction with re-instatement provisions.
A Statement
During the past week rumors have run rampant regarding 
the attitude of the Tartan towards the Arts Ball situation. It 
is reported that certain news articles about the Ball were pre
sented but not published and that unfounded statements were 
made in reporting and commenting upon the action of the Stu
dent Council in abolishing the Ball. It is only fair that the 
students be informed about the facts.
Ill presenting the story about the Ball, an attempt was 
made to present all of the facts which would show why the 
Student Council took the action it. did. The articles about the 
history of the Ball, flic one about the action of the Executive 
Board ill 1927, and the list of recommendations of the Arts 
Ball Committee were published to give uninformed minds a 
true picture of the situation.
As t.o the report, that news articles telling about the Ball 
supposedly submitted but not. aeeeptod for the issue of the 
Tartan published following the Ball, a statement regarding this 
should abet the rumors. It. has been the policy ol the Tartan 
for at least the past, four years not to publish so-called post 
mortem articles about social functions, except in From the 
li'cnee. On no other occasion this year have such articles been 
published, except in the column mentioned. Over one-third of 
flic space occupied by From the Fence in the issue following 
the event was devoted to a post mortem about five Arts Ball.
In regards to the statements made in reporting the action 
of Council, it can be said that only facts which had sufficient 
backing to warrant publication were given and that no effort 
was Made to exclude any of the discourse which was carried 
on at the Council meeting. This fact, accounts for flic large 
amount of space devoted to the article about the Student Coun
cil action.It might be of interest to Tartan readers to remind them 
of the stand taken by the Tartan regarding student opinion 
which was published in these columns in the February 14tli 
issue.
It is sufficient to say that contributions are welcomed and 
that there will be no bar to publication if they are signed by 
the writer.
CONTRI BS
All contrlbn must be signed by 
the writer. They are published a3 
sentiments of the writers.
The following letter was re
ceived Friday and apparently 
it wan written before the Stu
dent Council in el, Thursday 
evening. It 1h published, nevertheleBH, an the sentiments of. 
an Art student.
The fact that capricious prosper
ity Is still refusing to turn the cor
ner around which if. has been lurk
ing for the past three years, is a 
source of worry to each little Car
negie Kate, whether she is express
ing herself In Arts. School, or re
pressing herself in Maggie Murph. 
Almost every day her mythical 
budget Is strained to produce 
funds for chiffon hose, for cleaning 
formal gloves, and for any number 
of things, the aggregate cost of 
which would send her into bank
ruptcy.
Budgets prepared by the United 
States Department of Labor, or by 
the Home 13c. students are value
less to her, because she Is not a 
family of ilvej, nor has she time to 
scutter about for bargains at the 
food markets. Where can she buy 
six cents worth of soup,, two cents 
worth of spinach, and a nickels 
worth of dessert, Some one, it 
seems, should give the little girl a 
handhelp her out.-'
All this has been a preamble to 
what we mean to sayWhat this 
campus needs is a 5c piece of cake. 
Each little co-ed is making this 
plea Couldnt, the Grill possibly 
cut those huge slices of cake in 
half, and charge live cents for 
them? If this change could be af
fected, Carnegie0Kate could save 
ilve cents a day, twenty-five cents 
a week, as much as you save in a 
month by using a certain .brand of 
tooth paste. She would also save 
time each day, and run less risk of 
acquiring deadly pounds.
From newspaper accounts, we 
read that the daily lunches of 
Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, and 
Nora Shearer cost from fifty cents 
to a dollar. And here is Carnegie 
Kate trying to be glamorous, de
vastating, alluring, and thrifty, 
Doesnt slie deserve a break?
Eddie Cantor, cant you do some
thing about it, now that Roosevelt 
Is inaugurated and youre in Wash
ington?
In writing this letter I am, I be
lieve, reflecting the -attitude of a 
great many Art students in regards to the Arts Ball. It is a 
tradition for us. The Arts Ball has 
its part along with all the other 
things which school represents, 
and we feel justified in asking for 
a better reason than has been 
given, before iet make the conces
sion demanded of tus.
In spite of any action on the 
part of the Arts Ball Committee, 
and the consequent disturbance 
with Student Council; in spite of 
ignorance of rules) of petty preju
dices, placement of authority, func
tioning or laclc of functioning of 
councils or committeesin spite 
of all this, hasn't the entire affair 
boon a childish muddle? .After 
reading in last weoks Tartan the 
detached account of that almost 
dramatic council meeting it was 
hard to convince ones self that 
Mils Is ono of the most outstand
ing schools of the country, whore 
a select student body Is governed 
by an oven more select student 
group. 11! someone has made a 
mistake, it would seem much wiser 
to admit or overlook It. If the 
Arts Hall is to be abolished be
cause the Arts Ball Committee and 
Student Council failed to co
operate, It hardly soonis fair that 
everyoneoven those Svho havent 
yot. entered school -must suffor 
for their disagreement.
On the other hand, If thoughts 
of abolishing the Ball are prompt
ed by an unbecoming conduct that 
night, we have only to say that 
those who made any untasteful RSSun 
pluy have suffered In the esteem of 
the restand this In itself is their 
worst punishment.
In this chaotic relapse one might 
forget tluit no end of i people 
thought the evening entirely suc
cessful, and certainly the decora
tions and costumes were a credit 
and stimulus to any art school. 
We are united against its abolish
ment. Is it necessary to give up 
all Arts Ball because of the one 
unfortunate trip to Mars?

felt instantly throughout the land. 
Although national authority can 
not prevent financial peccadillos in 
the states, the whole country must 
suffer with the sinners. After a 
state has succumbed to exliuberant 
indiscretions in banking, a self im
posed quarantine does not protect 
the rest of the country.
Of course one may take comfort 
from the fact that the President is 
now in charge. This however is 
only an emergency act that gives 
the semblance of centralization. 
Indeed even some features of this 
may be ultimately declared uncon
stitutional.
Competent observers have long 
felt, that wo need fewer emergency 
actions and more premeditated 
programs. As a basis for those 
they suggest constitutional amend
ments and legislation that will en
tirely subordinate the states to the 
national government in banking, 
industry and commerce. This 
would divest the states of the 
power t.o break the natural con
tinuity of national economy into 
forty-eight, parts.
Such a program would constitute 
a legal revolution and a rather 
painful ono to some interests, but 
the pangs of readjustment should 
not be permitted to obstruct a 
salutary change.
Whether we will or not, we are 
in the midst of change and also of 
hope. So we may at least, hope 
among other things -for a change 
in the structure of government 
that will allow Congress and the 
President to give depositors com
prehensive protection before emer
gencies as well as during emer
gencies. The same solicitude 
would be equally appropriate to 
the child laborers, the underpaid 
women workers and the unem
ployed.
THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
Many of the students who daily traverse the 
cut have noted the appearance of a stuffed 
giraffe, sometimes known as a stuffed camelopard, 
In a certain window of Forbes Hall. This is no 
ordinary giraffe, it is a gift, a Christmas gift 
from oiie D. 
U, to another 
wearer of the 
pin. Nor does it merely 
serve a decor
ative purpose, 
it is used to 
cheer passers 
by, one in par

Most of the work performed by 
the Association came from local 
government agencies and might be 
characterized as outdoor labor 
projects, consisting of repair work 
on streets and roads in the cities 
and towns of the county.
The Association selected work
ers as far as possible 011 the basis 
of need. Each application for 
work contained information about 
the number of dependents, the 
period of unemployment, and the 
length of sorvico given to the last 
regular employer. Thus it was 
possible for the Association to de
termine whether the applicant was 
actually In nood of relief, a resi
dent of the district, and an em
ployable worker. Preference was 
given first, to heads of families and 
then to persons who wore support
ing dependents.
According to the report, employ
ment was given to t>,73(> persons 
during the spring and summer of 
1981. The program lasted from 
February to September. In the 
second year a total of 13,925 men 
and women received employment. 
The program began in November, 
1981, and continued until August, 
1932.
The wage rate at first'was .$0.50

eight hours a day, six days a week, 
but alternate weeks. Wiien a 
worker had received a total of 
.$100.00 in earnings, he was re
placed by another worker. The 
wage rate for women employed by 
the Association was $2.25 per da}r. 
They worked five days a week un
til the, limit of $100.00 in earnings 
was reached. The, foremen, time

permanent jobs, receiving in wages 
amounts varying from $1S.75 to 
$15.00 per> week.
In order preserve the normal

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
The use of any but the nomina
tive form of the pronoun I as 
a complement to the various forms 
of be has aroused almost as 
much controversial discussion as 
the determining of the origin of 
nature. Like the latter with its 
monkey business jests, it has ap
peared in humorous phases. The 
story is told of an applicant at the 
gate of Heaven who, because he 
identified himself with It is I, 
was ordered below with the cryptic 
There are too many college pro
fessors here already. This -per
son was evidently a fundamental
ist. In using I he followed the 
purists rule that the forms of be" 
have the same case after them as 
before them. He was also in ac
cord with a long line of fundamen
talists. This sort of fundamental
ism, however, has its limitations. 
He couid not accurately reason 
from the first premises of gram
mar that It is you is logical, for 
here you" is derived from the 
Anglo-Saxon accusative plural 
vowthe initial e becoming 
y, and the w being variantly 
written as u. Strictly speaking 
his usage should be It is thou 
the thou coming from the early 
nominative form, thu." The 
you, however, has been estab
lished by long usage; consequent
ly it is correct.
What, on the other hand, is to 
be said of the modernists It is 
me.'1 When one realizes in the 
light of linguistic history that me 
sometimes appeared in the sub
ject position, as in the expression! 
me thinks,- there seems to be 
ground for its use in the predicate 
complement position. Also, in com
parative. philology we find the 
verbal equivalent of me" com
pleting lie forms. For example, 
it is found thus in French. 
Furthermore it is true that the 
accusative form is usually consid
ered the more emphatic formit 
would be especially appropriate as 
a sentence close. Even more than 
these reasons in favor of me is 
its usage-7-that which justifies 
you. It must be quite obvious 
that It is mg has an extensive 
current usagemore in oral than 
in written English, because the 
former readily inclines to infor
mality. \ As to its acceptation and 
correctness in formal discourse, 
there remains some doubt. And 
very likely so long as there remain 
fundamentalists in English usage, 
those die-hards who cannot for
get to insist on what they were 
compelled to learn in their youth, 
our language etiquette will require 
It is I.

academic affairs; the fomenting of 
racial enmities; antiforeign agita
tion; preaching of a militant Kultur and finally the limiting of aca
demic freedom.
It is interesting, continues Dr. 
Baker, to observe the zeal of Hit
ler for German Ivultura man of 
110 education and few intellectual 
interests. Student outbreaks and 
demonstrations, and impassioned 
speeches 011 the streets by beard
less youths are quite frequent oc
currences. The enthusiasm of the 
students, . . . their idealism-is ad
mirable. If only their zest for cul
ture, jvere less .political and more 
intellectual. . . . The German stu
dent feels .that the future of the 
state is in his hands and that patri
otic universlty-men must work to 
promote the national spirit. It 
would be a catastrophe if the 
American University were invaded 
by politics, but the indifference of 
our students to questions of 
government and international af
fairs goes too far.
And as a summary of his ob
servations, Dr. Baker states that 
 . . . the present turbulent state 
of the universities is only one 
element . 7\. an important one . . . 
in the wrhole complex of German 
conditions . . . intellectual polit
ical, financial, social, and educa

the downtown Y. W. C. A. to col
lect used textbooks for needy stu
dents attending a night school in 
which tuition is free and courses 
in many college subjects are given. 
Because of the expense entailed in 
the purchase of college textbooks, 
the Y has appealed to Carnegie 
students to donate any books used 
in various subjects, regardless of 
the date of their use.
Students in all the schools may 
bring any textbooks dealing with' 
literature, languages, history, 
science, or psychology. Books 
dealing with secretarial work, 
household economics, social work, 
and arts, will also be of great 
value. Books should be placed on 
the table in the front hall of Mar

Arts Ball Revived

made by the Arts Senate. This 
provision removes one of the in
definite aspects surrounding- this 
years affair, according to Council 
members, art'd places the matter of 
whether or not Arts alumni may 
attend .the Ball with anyone other 
than Arts students or Arts alumni 
in the hands of the Arts Senate.
In a petition signed by 45G Arts 
students presented to Council last 
Tuesday evening, certain powers 
were demanded for the Arts Senate 
which the Council is not empow
ered to grant, and because of this 
it was impossible for the Council 
to take re-instatement steps at that 
time, the matter being referred by 
the Council to the Executive Board 
of Carnegie.
In addition to the demands made 
in the petition, it was also stated 
that the representatives of the 
Arts Senate were given the author
ity by the signers to agree to any 
satisfactory settlement. Rather 
than referring the matter to the 
Executive Board as provided for 
Tuesday by  the' Council, the Arts 
Senate representatives agreed to 
re-instatement of the Ball as a 
regular Student Council supervised 
function, with the exception that 
attendance be limited to Arts stu
dents and Arts alumni
According to a Council ruling 
made in 1929, the Ball is to be held 
every two years, and although 
there will be 110 Ball next year, it 
was felt by the Council members 
that the recommendations should 
be made in order to avert any recurence of the misunderstanding 
w'hich arose this year.

Little whales.
Lots take action at once. Got him 
a good pipe and a Im of good tobacco. 
We all know a pipe smooths out the 
wrinkles, clears the mind for its best 
thinking. And we all know what 
smoking tobacco goes best in a good 
pipb. For a recent investigation 
showed Edgeworth to be the favorite 
smoke at 42 out of 54 leading colleges.
Next time you 'cram for an exam, 
light up a pipeful of Edgeworth. Ah! 
See how that different blend of fine 
old burleys makes even the toughest
problem a whole lot easier.
Buy Edgeworth anywhere in two 
forms  Edgeworth Ready-Rubbed 
and Edgeworth Plug Slice. All sizes 
 15ff pocket package to pound hu
midor tin. If you would like to try

TAMING LIGHTNING
A crackle, a deafening crashand a gigantic 
streak of man-generated lightning leaped 30 
feet. Thus, was 10,000,000 volts, the largest 
artificial Hash ever produced by man, dis
charged at the G-E high-voltage laboratory. 
To produce this enornrous voltage, a 
50,(jOO,000-lcw. lightning generator imitates 
nature. Hundreds of small capacitors take 
the place of natures clouds. They are charged 
by transformers. When the voltage is built 
up, the capacitors are discharged in series to 
produce 10,000,000 volts. Sounds simple, 
doesnt it? However, the power output of the 
generatorduring the infinitesimal period of 
the flash-is nearly twice that of all Lhe gen
erating stations in the United Suites.
F. W. Peek, Jr., a Stanford grad of 05, was 
ohiefiy responsible for this achievementin
cidentally, he is now the chief engineer of 
the G-E Pittsfield Works. Lightning tamer, 
his old classmates would iprobably call him. 
And rightly proud of him they should be, for 
in the field of transients and dielectric phe
nomena be is second to no one.
ATOM CHASER
On December 10th Iasi, a mild-mannered 
scientist stood in the Great Hall in Stockholm 
and received the Nobel Award in Chemistry 
for 1932. Then he went skiing with his wife 
and daughter, seemingly unmoved by being 
the second American chemist in 31 years to 
he so honored.
In 1909, Dr. Irving Langmuir, a 03 graduate 
of Columbia University, came to Schenectady, 
to the G-E Research Laboratory, to ask ques
tions about tungsten wire, its behavior in a 
vacuum. He stayed, just looking around 
and wondering why the bulbs of incandescent 
lamps blackened so easily. He found out, and 
thus developed the gas-filled lamp. It saves 
Americans a million dollars every night.
Then he wondered about atoms cooperating 
with electrons and produced the high-vacuum 
electronic tube, making possible radio broad
casting, which created an industry. Inciden
tally, he.contributed a new type of welding 
atqmie-hydrogen.
They call him atom chaser, electron driver. 
The Swedish Academy'of Science rewarded 
himnot for lamps, radio tubes, or welding 
methods, but for achievements in pure 
science. For just "wondering.
25 MILLION THERMOMETERS
You may have heard about our new power 
plant at Schenectadythe first of its kind 
ever built. In it theres a 20,000-kw. mercuryvapor turbine. The plant uses mercury vapor 
for power, the exhaust vapor producing super
heated steam.
270,000 pounds of mercury will be needed for 
the boilers. Thats enough for 25,000,000 ther
mometers. Perhaps you wonder why we dont 
use water. Well, the new process makes it 
possible lo obtain about thirty per cent more 
power from coal than heretofore. And we 
dont expect that those boilers will be refilled.
W. L. R. Emmet, an 81'graduate of the U. S. 
Naval Academy, is the inventor of this mcrcurv-vapor process. That isnt all hes done, 
either. In his capacity as a consulting engi
neer of G.E., he developed the steam turbine 
from a small beginning to a place of domi
nating importance, and he first applied electric 
power lo ship propulsion.
