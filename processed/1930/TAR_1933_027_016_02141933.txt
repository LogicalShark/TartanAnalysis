Student Council Committee 
Chosen to Select Bands 
And Sign Contracts
At the last meeting of Student 
Council it was decided that a'committee composed of the executive 
secretary and the chairman of the 
social committee for Student Coun
cil will in the future have charge 
-of the hiring of orchestras for all 
social functions under Student 
Council.
The list of some of the dances 
under these arrangements Avill in
clude the Senior Ball, the Wom
ens Junior Prom, the Mens Junior 
Prom, the Soph Hop and Campus 
Week dances.
It has been customary in the 
past for the respective dance com
mittees to select and hire the or
chestra for their dance with the 
final approval of Student Council. 
In the future the executive sec
retary and the' chairman of the 
social committee for Student Coun
cil will deal directly  with some 
large musical organization, select 
3. list of orchestras that re avail
able and come under the dance 
budget, and then submit he list 
to the committee chosen for the 
dance. The dance committee will 
make their choice from the sub
mitted list and have it approved 
by the Student Council committee 
who will have .the power to . sign 
the contracts.
 It was suggested by a member 
of- the .Student Council committee 
that by this new method it will 
probably be possible to hand out a 
single contract to some nlusical 
corporation for all the main dances 
under Student Council for the year 
and in that way secure a good 
selection of orchestras at a low 
price. It would then be possible to 
give the students a reduction on 
the ticket prices. for the dances 
signed under this single contract.
One of the causes for the plac^ inc. of. the arrangement of the or-chestras into the hands of a Stu
dent Council committee was that 
the respective dance committees 
has considerable trouble and un
certainty in dealing with booking 
agents. The new committee will 
deal directly with the bauds.

Just recently there has been pub

Petty which will probably be of in
terest to many Carnegie students 
since Dr. Petty, the former minis

Originally the book was given 
as a series of radio talks over 
KDKA. The titles of some _oi the 
chapters are Courage, Hope, Suc

articles retain quite as much spirit

Well-Known Architect Dissertates 
Upon Modernism in Architecture
By WILLIAM
C. Grant La Farge, well-known 
architect who lectured last Friday 
night at the Carnegie Union, at
tempted, in his discourse on Mod
ernism in Architecture, to an
alyze the controversy now en
suing between the conservative 
group and the modernist, or socalled radical group. Presenting his 
lecture in the form of an argu
ment, Mr. La Farge preceded his 
talk with a series of lantern slides 
in which direct comparison of fine 
examples of traditional architec
ture and examples of the present 
modern styles, the International 
style in particular, was obtained.
The apostles of modernism ad
vance functionalism as an exclus
ive claim oi' the New Style," Mr 
La Farge states. Defining func
tionalism as meaning that the plan 
of a building suits its use, its in
herent qualities being stated by 
its materials and its structure and 
design boing logical and in ac
cord with the function of the 
building, Mr. La Farge goes on to 
declare the excellencce of such an 
ideal but is it such a new thought? 
Is it not true of all good, sound, 
logical architecture and has it not 
been striven for by architects 
throughout the ages? The Greeks 
w'ere functional, their temples hon
est,. sound, logical. The French 
Goth?^ was consistently and pur
posefully functional. But the 
Greeks &nd Goths could not be 
satisfied \with mere functionalism. 
They felt it necessary to adorn 
nd embellish their edifices, and 
/
LANDSBERG
their structures attained a mag
nificent, everlasting beauty that 
has rarely been equalled.
The modernists propose to severe 
all connections with the past  to 
shake off the fetters of tradition 
and attain a new freedom of de
sign that is more in accord with 
an age so greatly influenced by 
the machine. But what is tradi
tion? asks Mr. La . Farge. Does 
it mean slavery to certain form
ulas of design or is it tho clever, 
successful adaptation of all that 
is good in the past to present day 
conditions? Art through the ags 
has been a continuous flow of 
aesthetics. Are we then to be
lieve that a sudden, abrupt de
parture is for the better.
The exponents of the Interna
tional Style, declares Mr. La 
Farge, in their desire to achieve 
a new freedom of design, are im
posing a set of rules as rigid, as 
strict and as, binding as anything 
they are trying to supplant and 
are instituting a standardization of 
design as tiresome as that which 
they are trying to escape from. 
Since the time of prehistoric man 
who decorated the sides of his 
cave with pictures of animals there 
has always been present in man 
the instinct to adorn. That feel
ing has persisted to the present 
day and there is every reason to 
believe that it will always per
sist. For that reason we must 
reject stark fuctionalism since it 
is aesthetically out of accord with 
the nature of man.
Final arrangements have been 
made for the completion of details 
for the Arts Ball which will be 
held Friday  night in the Main 
Foyer of the College of Fine Arts. 
The decorations, said to be the 
most colorful ever to be set up at 
any previous Arts Ball, include a 
very intricate system of lighting 
and ornamentation.- The center of 
attraction in the decorations will 
be a huge mask of some fantastic 
monster in the.center of the main 
hall directly in trout of the main 
office. This mask, besides having 
large weird-loolcing eyes,'will have 
an over-sized mouth from which 
great clouds of smoke will issue. 
The lower lip of the monsters 
mouthwill be so arranged that it 
drops down and reveals a stage. 
About three times duriiig the even
ing this lip will be lowered, and 
a group of dancers and entertain
ers will appear on the stage.
The entire first floor is being 
wired for these decorations, and 
contrary to former years, no one 
will be able to see the finished 
decorations until the night of the 
Ball, for the side Avails and ceil
ings are to be covered with 
screens during school, hours.
The music for the Ball will. be 
furnished by tlie Penn. State Var
sity Ten. This orchestra is very 
well known around this section of 
Pennsylvania, having played at 
several Pitt dances and several of 
the Penn State dances, besides 
many other outstanding affairs.
The Ball is to be charcteristic of 
life on the planet Mars, and all 
decorations and costumes are to be 
in accordance Avith this Jdea.: - In

Our Changing Occupations, 
statistical survey comparing th 
problems of unemployment in the 
United States, Pennsylvania, and 
Pittsburgh, has just been written 
by Messrs. John D. Beatty and 
Herbert L. Grau of the Bureau of 
Recommendations of Carnegie In
stitute of Technology. This stiidy 
has been conducted under the aus
pices of the Pittsburgh Personnel 
Association. The policy of this 
association has always been to ad
vance the understanding of the 
principles, policies, and methods of 
creating and maintaining satisfac
tory human relations in commerce 
and industry in,the Pittsburgh dis
trict.
The occupational classifications 
selected for this study represent 
only a part of those for which sta
tistics are given in the Federal 
Census reports for 1910, 1920 and 
1930. These were selected because 
they are the classifications in 
which the broad occupational 
changes have occurred in the pe
riod studies. It should be kept in 
mind, in interpreting the informa
tion presented, that the census 
classifications of 1930 vary some
what from the classifications of 
1910 and 1920; the classifications 
are described in the Thirteenth, 
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Censuses 
of tlie'United States. Eaph-per-.. 
sons own experience will' permit 
him to draw conclusions from a 
study of these figures.______________
The Federal Census of Unem
ployment for April, 193-0, showed 
that 5 per cent of the normally 
gainful workers of the United 
States were out of work and look
ing for jobs, and that an additional 
l.G per cent, normally with jobs, 
were on lay-off without pay. At 
that early date in this depression 
the greatest declines were notice
able in such branches of tlie man
ufacturing and mechanical indus
tries as the building, automobile, 
iron and steel, and textile indus
tries. The mining industries also 
showed evidence of continuing in 
tlieir previous state of depression.
In Pennsylvania the percentage 
of unemployment as shown in the 
April, 1930, Census was, as would 
be expected, slightly higher than 
in the United States as a whole. 
Five and six-tenths per cent of the 
normally gainful employed were at 
the time out of work and looking 
for jobs, and an additional 3.2 per 
cent were on lay-off without pay. 
The figures for Pittsburgh showed 
that 7.3 per cent of the normally 
gainfully employed were unem
ployed, and an additional 2.1 were 
on lay-off without pay.
The drastic declines in employ
ment since April, 1930, can be seen 
from a study of the graphs which 
adcompahy; the book. These 
graphs show in index numbers the 
fluctuations in employment in the 
various fields in the United States. 
Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh.

32 Post-Season 
Pledges Secured 
By Fraternities
List of New Pledges Follows 
This Artcile
Since the last compilation of the 
social fraternity pledges was pub 
lished in the December 13 issue of 
the Tartan, 56 names have been 
added to the list swelling it from 
a mere 156 to a grand total of 212. 
Contrary to all predictions this final 
number of pledges shows an in
crease of 5 per cent over last 
years total at this time although 
the original number was much 
smaller. The best that could be 
boasted last season by the frater
nities in the Tartans final check

Included among these 56 names 
are those of the pledges of the Alpha 
Sigma Phi, the Alpha Phi' Delta, 
and the Lambda Ulii Alpha frater
nities Avho failed to report their 
neAV men in time for the first pub 
lication. Excluding the 14 men of 
these three fraternities, there are 
32 new pledges, six more than the 
total number of post-season pledges 
at this time last year. No doubt 
the final decision has rested more 
fully upon the families of the men

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Prof. C. L. Willibald Trinks, 
head of the department of Me
chanical Engineering, is the oldest 
living appointee to the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, and one 
of the four original ones remain
ing. He was born in Berlin and, 
inheriting a taste and talent for 
music from his father, studied pi
ano formally until the age of 19, 
and' composition during the latter 
part of this period. His teachers 
Avere the Schanvenka brothers.
In 1S93 Professor Trinks entered 
Cliarlottenberg Poly-Tecli, from 
Avhich he graduated Avith honors in 
1897 Avith a mechanical engineer
ing degree. It Avas during his col
lege days that he decided to folCHA engineering  instead, of music 
as a profession. With the inten
tion of returning to Charlottenberg 
to accept a teaching position after 
having acquired some practical ex
perience, he Avorked first in the 
Ruhr valley and. then in England 
at design. Other short-term posi
tions as Avell as his original in
tention ceased Avlien he became 
chief engineer for the Wm. Todd 
Co. of Youngstown, O., in 1902.
Professor Trinks came to Car
negie in the busy days of 1905 as 
head of the department of Me
chanical Engineering. He recalls 
that one of .his first jobs here Avas 
the design of an A-frame, Avhich 
still stands in the Industries build
ing, Avhere the. department wras 
then located. Meanwhile he has 
become Consulting engineer for 
several well-knoAvn organizations 
in the Pittsburgh district.
In addition to his magazine con
tributions, Professor Trinks is the 
author of the following books:
Governors and Governing Primemovers (1918), Industrial Fur
naces (vol. 1, 1923; vol. II, 1025), 
Industrie Ofen (1928, in Ger
man), Roll Pass Design (1930), 
and Shaft Design, in collabora
tion Avith Housum. Reprints from 
his work have been published in 
Kents Mechanical Engineers 
Handbook.
Professor Trinks is a member 
of Tau Beta Pi, the American So
ciety of Mechanical Engineers, the 
Society of Automotive Engineers, 
the American Institute of Iron and 
Steel Engineers, the Society for 
the Promotion of Electrical Engi
neering, the Engineers Society of 
Western Pennsylvania, the Ameri
can Iron and Steel Institute, and 
two German engineering societies. 
He is also a member of the Pitts
burgh Athletic Association.
Although Whos Who in Amer
ica lists his recreation as Avork, 
his hobby, music, might well be 
substituted, for his love of the art 
still persists. He likes to play 
four-hand pieces Avith Professor 
Ely another member of the de
partment. Among his favorite com
posers are Liszt, Wagner, Chopin 
and Debussey; Beethoven, as he 
brings out in an interesting dis
cussion, is often tiring; Brahms a 
bit heavy, except for his Hungarian 
dances.
Professor Trinks is as Avell re
garded as an instructor for his 
straight and forthright thinking 
as for his charitable regard for 
students limitations. His lectures 
are often brightened by witty ob
servations; outside of class his 
conversation shows a fun-loving 
disposition. And, too, he is a very 
ablo punster.

Effect of Depression 
Noted in Lowering 
Of Wage Scale
Questionnaires wore submitted 
by Miss Burnett, head of the De
partment of Social Work, in Octo
ber, 1932, to 124 graduates of her 
department and 113 replies Avere 
received by February 1, 1933. It 
Avas found that the total number 
of full-tim.e positions reported this 
year is 64 as against 58 in 1932 
and 52 in 1931, In addition seven 
married graduates are employed in 
part-time or in full-time positions 
for a part of the year.
The effects of the depression are 
principally seen in the somewhat 
larger number, of person 3 available 
for posiLions avIio are not employ

yearand the larger number of 
salaries that appear in the lowest 
group, namely, (hoBe salaries un

gory this year is 5 as comparod 
Avith 2 in 1932. There have also 
been small losses'in the higher 
salaried groups, indicating the Cal 
that persons have received salary 
cuts in these groups and that no 
other individuals have beoii ad
vanced into those categoiios. On 
tho other hand, the total of 45

Who Threw That Nasty Earthworm? 
Is New Mystery in Maggie Murph
With the booking of detective 
thrillers in so many of our local 
theaters Carnegie science students 
pop up Avith their own little mys
tery. No solution has yet been of
fered Avhich can serve as a logical 
ansAver to the question, since sci
ence students, Avliose minds are 
trained in the conngurations of ro
tational inertia and detraction, of 
electrons, are not accustomed to 
dealing with the ordinary problems 
of life. One does acknowledge 
that the mystery, perhaps because 
it is a mystery, is a little out ot tho 
ordinary; yet, when ono wishes to 
classify it, one readily ECCE that It 
is mainly a psychological problem, 
based upon the emotions and ac
tions of the ordinary human being.
Tho question is, briefly this: 
Who threAv an earthworm at Betty 
Co-ed as she stepped out of the 
biology lab? Perhaps a revieAV of 
the facts leading up to the event 
av ill help to give some clue to the 
solution of the mystery. On Mon
day afternoon Eetty Co-ed, with 
some twenty of her sophomore 
classmates, had been dissecting 
eartli-Avorms to trace the digestive 
system. As the time approached 
tAventy minutes past the hour, Betty 
Co-ed cleaned and put away her 
dissecting kit, tied her name-tag to 
her worm, and placed It, with the 
Avorms of \er classmates, into a 
jar of fc ldehyde preservative.
By LITTITIA LYTELLE
She powdered her nose (witnesses 
of her. departure cannot recall 
AVhether or not lipstick Avas used), 
picked up her books, and Avalked 
tOAvards the door, skillfully timing 
her arrival at the threshold Avith 
the ringing of the dismissal bell. 
Since Betty Co-eds departure was 
quite legal, the students paid no 
more attention to her, and returned 
to their own pursuits. Just two or 
three second after interest in her 
had waned, her heart-breaking cry 
rang through the building; and 
Betty became the cynoaure of the 
class, for ensconced upon her per
manent Avave Avas an earthworm, 
slung to its height by a deft hand, 
the hand of the unknown offender.
Jacques Salstoufi, famous ama
teur detective, has volunteered the 
opinion that the Avorm was placod 
upon the head of tho unsuspecting 
student as a Avarning from a local 
blackhand society.
Miss Co-ed Avas undoubtedly as
saulted by a criminal of the most 
vicious tendencies, one in whom 
the dislike and distaste for earthAvorms causes uncontrollable reac
tions, is the assertion of Profes
sor Confab, a member of the psy
chology department.
Solutions of various other in
structors and of prominent per
sonages in the city depend upon

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1933
THE
PLAID SPORTS 
SCREEN 

BY JOE BRONSON
Tartan Swimmers 
Season Against
Open
Panthers
Skibos Lose 
To Reserve, 
Notre Dame
THE CARNEGIE ATHLETES HAVE BEEN ENJOYING A SOMEWHAT quiet period for the laot wock or two with little If anything to 
occupy their minds except the final examinations. These examina
tions, however, which seem to be the pet perversion of many of the 
professors, gives the dean of knowledge his chance of sclf-asscrtlvcness, 
the result of which Is to the student often times more formidable than 
the most worthy opponent. At the present time neither the student nor 
the coach knows just where he stands, and when the sad news comes 
qut In a day or two many a mentor will have a lot of rebuilding to do.
But as I said above, before my thoughts became distracted, that 
the last week has been sort of a quiet period, but It is just the lull 
which precedes the storm. Beginnihg now, oach of Carnegies winter 
sports teams enters Into several weeks' strenuous activity with few 
breathing spells until the season Is over.
COACH HANNUMS BASKETBALL TEAM approaches the half way 
murk of what lias proven to be a difficult and treacherous campaign. 
After falling to come out ahead In the last live starts, the Plaid live 
will attempt to break their losing Btreak In the contest wlh George
town Saturday night In the Tartan gym. The Skibos will have to gain | 
a victory to enable them to remain In second place In the conference; 
the Temple Owls having drawn up to an even position by their vic
tory over West Virginia.
The Tartan's last two encounters have resulted In rather* close de
feats, the kind that are quite hard to take. The Notre Dame Ramblers, 
by virtue of a last second basket, managed to eke out a 37-35 victory 
in South Bend last week. There was quite a bit of dispute regarding 
the validity of the basket. The Notre Dame timekeeper said that the 
basket had been made after time was up and just us the gun was 
shot off. The officials ruled that the gun is what counts; so slowness 
at the trigger meant death to the hopes of revenge over the Irish.
If you are used to riddles you might work this one for me. Pitt 
heats Tech, Notre Dame beats Pitt, Tech play Notre Dame even, Pitt 
downs Western Reserve, Western Reserve trims Tech. Something 
seems amiss somewhere but that is how it goes. The Western Re
serve Red Cats were on Saturday night and in no uncertain manner. 
Eddie Finnegan, the pride of Cleveland (if you dont believe me ask 
him), finally gave his public something to cheer about. Mr. Finnegan 
scored eight baskets and one foul for a total of seventeen points. The 
final score was 40-33.
Bad Decision Gives Irish 
37-35 Win; Finnegan 
Stars for Cats
PROSPECTS FOR THE BOXING MATCH WITH PITT on Thursday 
night seemed quite good especially after the Dukes, who had been 
previously defeated by the Skibos, took the Pitt Panthers into camp 
by a 4-3 score. But the last minute inside information has It that at 
least two or three of the stalwart leather pushers of the Plaid squad 
were KOd by the semester exams and will be ineligible to compete 
on Thursday night. The information received has not been confirmed 
so we cant give out the names, but that Is the dope anyway. If such 
proves to be the case, Coach Ernie Sesto will certainly be on the 
spot. It is not exactly an easy job to reach In the old grab bag and 
produce three boxers who can successfully fill the shoes of their more 
unfortunate teammates. Just where he could get these men is quite 
hard to say, but If worst comes to worst, maybe Ernie can put on a 
disguise and go in there himself.
The Panthers by no means have a weak team. They have been 
steadily Improving since the middle of the season, and against Duquesne they flashed several good men. In the 115, 135, 145, and 155- 
pound classes they have men who will give any one a good fight. 
Cowboy" Siegal who fought his first fight of the year In the 165-pound 
class has an awful wallop and should be better in his next fight than 
he was In his first.
TIIE VARSITY SWIMMERS WILL COME INTO THE) LIMELIGHT 
tor the first time this year on Friday night al. which time they will fry 
to splash tlveir way to a, victory over the Pittsburgh Panthers In the 
Panther's pool. It will be the first moot of the year for the Tartan 
swimmers, and Captain Norm Franke will ho out there trying to load 
his mates to a victory. Ho will bo at a. disadvantage because the 
oppononts havo already had four moots In which to got Into shape, and 
from the times made in theso meets if looks as if the Panthers should 
havo the odgo. Dosplto tho fact that they lost to the strong teams 
of Yalo and Harvard, they came hack to defeat Delaware and Franklin 
& Marshall. Coach Rlsodorph Is having a, hard time replacing tho 
positions loft vacant by tho graduation of Tod Estebroolc, diver, and 
Captain Edwards of last year's team. Dosplto thoso handicaps, the 
moot should bo Interesting and should glvo tho team a chunao to meas
ure Its strength against futuro oppononts.
A MISTAKE WAS MADE IN THIS COLUMN several weeks ngo re
garding tho day that tho wrestling conch would be on hand to glvo 
Instruction to ntudentn, and wo desire to make the necessary correc
tions. Conch Joe Rlntelen will be in tho wrestling room on Tuesdays 
mid Thursday from 4:30 to 0:00 and wishes any persons who are 
Interested In tho mat game to see him at that time. In addition to tho 
Intramural moot whioh will bo hold this year as usual, Coaoh Rlntolon Intends to form a wrestling club out of tho squad. This club will 
try to schedule matches with teams In this vicinity and perhaps with 
a few out of town teams. At tho olose of tho season a special Insignia 
will bo awarded to tho mombors.
MIRACLES DO HAPPENovon In this day and ago! Tho good old 
game of football which has undergone so many changes during tho 
past, few years seems destined to carry on next year In much tho 
same manner as if did last year. It seems that I he wise men of tho 
game have gotten together and after much deliberation they have at 
last come to tho conclusion that tho gumo Is alright as it Is and needs 
very little changing.
Tho rules committee of the American Football Coaches Associa
tion which makes suggestions which it gives to the National Rules 
Committee, offered but one notable change to last years rules. It 
suggested that in a case where the ball was carried within ten yards 
of the side line, it should bo moved to a point ten yards from that lino 
and put into play there. To me, this is a very constructive change, and 
I think the game will benefit by it. Too often a team has lost a scor
ing chance because they have had to lose a down in getting the ball 
into a playing position. The loss of. a down deep in the opponents ter
ritory often times means the difference between victory and defeat.
So, when the National Rules committee gets together we hope 
that they follow the example of the coaches committee; pass upon 
the constructive measure offered to them, and let the game rest us 
it is for a year or two.

Plaid Tankmen Lead by 
Capt. Franke Will 
Meet Pitt Friday
TWO 1932 STARS 
LOST FROM TEAM
in the between semester lull, the 
plaid courimen took part in two 
buttles und lost both by heart
breaking scores. Maxie I-Iannums 
boys are still squuwldng very 
loudly ubout thut Notre Dame 
game, and the Western Reserve 
tilt wus dropped becuuse one man, 
Finnegun, just couldnt be stopped.
The Notre Dume mlxup wus 
somewhut unusuul und caused 
quite a furore for a while. With 
less thun two minutes to pluy it 
looked as if the Tartuns hud the 
gume in the proverbiul bug, but u 
long shot und a foul knotted the 
count ut 35-35. At this point the 
gume reully ended, but the time
keeper's gun jummed und failed to 
go off. While, the official was 
wildly waving his hands at the 
referee, Moose Kruuse took 
long 'shot ut the buclcbourd und 
through the loop for whut de
veloped into the winning counter. 
After considerable urgument over 
whether or not the busket counted, 
the officiuls were prevulled upon 
to give the gume to Notre Dume. 
At South Bend, evidently suckers 
urent the only ones who fail to 
get un even breuk.
The Western Reserve gume wus 
a thriller throughout, und the 
spurkling type of bull dlspluyed by 
both tennis sent the Clevelund 
funs home very well sutislied. The 
Red Cuts started out in high gear 
und rolled up it 9-1 lend before the 
Skibos knew thut the gume hud 
started. At this point in the pro
ceedings Messrs. Smith und Fer
gus began to make things very 
tough und the hnlf ended with 
the score tied ut 22-ull. In tho 
second stunza Reserve uguin got 
off to a good start, und this time 
they piled up an udvuntuge so 
lurge thut the Plaid simply couldnt 
overcome It. Finngun made the eve
ning very miserable for the Car
negie, defense, for. he scored no 
less than 17 points, which is quite 
a nights work. Fergus and Smith 
both played exceptional bull 
throughout the gume, but their 
efforts were of no nvail, and the 
Clevelanders left the floor with a 
40-33 decision under their bolts.
PantherB Show Good Form 
In Victories Over 
Delaware, F. & M.
The Tartan natators have their 
first official clush ut 8 oclock next 
Frlduy evening in the Trees Pool

competition thut is sure to be of

far the Tech swimmers have met

Hannum Will Attempt 
To Defeat Prexies 
At Washington
After a disastrous five game los
ing streak, the Plaid basketeers 
will uttempt to get buck into the 
winning column this week by taking over Wush-Jeff and George
town. The Prexy encounter is 
scheduled for Wednesduy on the 
Little Washington floor, und the 
Georgetown gume will be played 
ut the Curnegie Gym on Saturday 
evening.
From all Indications the break
ing of this losing streak should 
not be so very difficult, for locul 
funs can remember that earlier in 
the year Max Hannum seemed to 
have at least two teams that were 
superior to any Prexy combina
tion. Calling games in advance is 
never good practice, however, and 
a bad Carnegie night or a good 
W-J night might make quite a 
difference in the outcome. When 
a team is in a slump, there are 
times when no team can fail to 
beat you, or at least thats the 
way it seems.
Just how tough Georgetown will 
be is open to conjecture. Pitt 
completely routed the Hoyas in 
their opener here, but since then 
the team from Washington, D. C., 
has taken a close decision from 
West Virginia. The visitors will 
be spurred on to better efforts in 
an endeavor to avenge a humili

Hamper Skibos in 
Second Match
Ernie Sestos gloved gladiators 
meet their second big test of the 
season when Pitt is faced across 
the squared ring en Thursday 
night. The Tartan boxers journey 
to the Stadium, holding a victory 
over their other city rival, Duquesne, and as the Dukes have in 
turn defeated Pitt, it would ap
pear as though Carnegie was all 
set to snatch one from the Pan
thers. However, the colored gen
tleman in the fuel pile at the 
present time is Old Man Eligibil
ity and unless all indications fail, 
Coach Sesto might make the short 
trip Thursday night minus a few 
star performers.
The dependable Captain Henry 
Carr is a sure starter and hopes 
to add to his victory string with 
u win over Giunnati, although the 
latter'has been going at a fast 
clip for the Panthers and may 
provide u strenuous evening for 
the Sltibo leader. In the 155 class, 
Bill Kulas, the newcomer who im
pressed the fans so favorably in 
the Duke affair, stacks up against 
Jack Shricker, the Conference 
Champion, and Bills ability will 
undoubtedly get the well known 
acid test. Comuntzls, who is also 
a first-year varsity member, is 
again set to start at 115 pounds. 
His opponent will either be Pearla 
or Chailes Junge, both capable 
performers.
The feature bout of the evening, 
providing both boys are able to 
start at the weight, will be the 
renewal of the OToole-Seigel 
fued, which started last year when 
the Cowboy has handed a taint
ed decision over Curnegies fa
mous Buttleship. The other 
entrunts for Curnegie ure as yet 
undecided.
Pitt hus already lost to Duquesne and West Virginia, al
though they hold a 4-3 decision 
over Temple. Thursdays match

but if any of the boys, dont make

The company issuing this policy 
was recently organized by a group 
of leading sportsmen especially for] 
the sports fraternity. The policy 
was drawn with a view of offering 
at a minimum premium cost ade
quate protection against expenses 
incident to student accidents in the 
field of sports.
Officials of the company have 
perfected a series of accident pol
icies that cover such student sports 
as football, baseball, basketaball 
and hockey.
The policy is issued in two 
forms. One form covers all acci
dents however and wherever sus
tained with a few exceptions pro
vides for full reimbursement CS. 
medical bills with special benefits 
for fractures und dislocations. Theother form is a modified form of 
reimbursement policy for student 
athletics, providing full reimbursemeit for injuries sustained whiles 
practoicing for or participating in 
any form of recognized sport.
The Sportsmens Mutual Assur
ance Company is a national organ
ization and a co-ordinated mediums 
for the assembly and study of all 
statistics relative to sports.

has to be a different kind of 
tobacco from that used in 
cigarettes... and it has to be 
made by an entirely different 
process ...
OUT in Kentucky, where they have 
pretLy women, fast horses, and 
blue grass, there grows a tobacco called 
White Burley. It doesnt grow anywhere 
else in the world.
There is a type of tliis While Burley 
that is best suited for pipe smoking. It 
is neither too thick nor too thin. It is 
not light and chaffy; at the same time, 
it is not rank or strong. "U. S. Type 
31 is the 
for White Burley.
Since no other pipe tobacco has yet 
been found which seems to equal White 
Burley, this is what .we use in making 
Granger Rough Cut.
Next, we use the Wellman Method, 
a famous 1870 method of making pipe 
tobacco, to give Granger its fine flavor 
and fragrance. Then, too, Granger is 
"Rough Cutjust like they used to 
"whittle their tobacco off a plug with 
a jack-knife. It smokes cool, lasts longer 
and never gums a pipe.
And finally, we want to sell Granger 
for 10 cents. Good tobaccoright pro
cesscut right. So we put Granger in 
a sensible soft foil pouch instead of an 
expensive package, knowing that a man 
cant smoke the package.
Granger has not been on sale very 
long, but it has grown to be a popular 
smoke. Folks seem to like it.

Right before your very eyes the man of magic draws
Well, here we are, back again on 
the air after two weeks of silence. 
Sort of felt queer not to have any
thing to write about. Of course I 
could write, but then what would 
be the use if nobody reads it, 
which may be the case all the 
time, but then who cares. But 
theres the rub. Let me fall down 
once and watch the editor climb all 
over my frame. Maybe it does 
mean something to be an Idle Night 
Student, always popping off at the 
wrong time, and saying nothing at 
th right time.
Guess all of the citizens of the 
night school are glad their grades 
have been received. I should have 
qualified my statement I suppose, 
and should have said, those who 
passed, because I know those who 
received R. F. and I. grades have 
something else to say. But then, 
that is the way of the world. You 
cant please all the people, and 
those whom you please at one 
time, are displeased at another 
time. Ah me! this is a great world 
if you dont weaken.
Speaking of grades, I noticed re
cently, that a new system of grades 
has been established for the- epi
cures. It seems that in Brookline, 
Mass., the eating emporiums are 
graded according to the marks 
which their establishments rate 
when they are inspected. What an 
idea. Tile grades established are 
excellent, good, and fair. We 
couldnt adopt any such system on 
our campus because all our eat 
 shops are excellent and the class 
of food they offer, well try to beat 
it anywhere. I give up.
In the same line, that is along 
the same line of thought with eats is 
drinks. And when we think of drink
ing, intoxication comes into our 
minds, not always, but sometimes, 
The funny part of the whole ques
tion is serving intoxicated drinks 
to our autos, in other words, intoxicated fuel is sought by some 
advocates for our chariots. Gee, 
wouldn't that be fine. It appears 
that some solon in the government 
proposes to introduce a bill at 
Washington which would make 
anti-prohibitionists out of automobilists. What a combination? The 
measure proposes that all motor 
fuel be required to contain at least 
ten per cent of alcohol manufac
tured from farm products. The 
claim for the liquored gasoline 
would be that it would give the 
cars more pep and also help the 
farmers. As regards the farmers, 
I don't know how much it would 
help, but the automobilists, I am 
sure would have a jolly good time. 
Lets hope the bill goes through.
Workers to Report 
In Gym February 22
All night students interested 
in earning points toward an in
signia award are requested to 
report in the Mens Gymnasium, 
Wednesday afternoon, February 
22, at 2:30 o'clock. Preparations 
for the dance to be held that 
evening will have to be made 
and as the time is very limited 
all those who possibly can do 
so are urged to be out and help 
with the necessary work.
ChangingT emper 
Of People Urged 
By Famous Men
In the ever changing evolution 
of civilization there are long pe
riods when traditional ideas and 
principles flourish with little or no 
change. The sum total of the 
customs, morals, actions, and 
thoughts of the people form what 
is known in simple language as the 
temper of the times. Thus over a 
period of twenty-five to fifty years 
ideas remain with people because 
they have been brought up in an 
atmosphere fostering those ideas.
Suddenly something happens, or 
perhaps that something is the re
sult of the covered up evils over a 
period of many years, and a change 
in spirit is noticed. Gradually this 
change in spirit sweeps from one 
level of society to another until 
that which has caused the change 
in spirit is replaced by something 
else.
Conditions In tne past four years 
have gripped the nation, and the 
world, in a vise of fear. All dur
ing this time there has been a 
group who preached the gospel of 
sitting tight and waiting for things 
to change. The idea was that 
everyone was to live on as low a 
level as possible to sustain life and 
hope for conditions to change. This 
is exactly-what most people did.
As time went by and no change 
took place, there arose a few indi
viduals here and there who no 
longer had faith in the policy of 
waiting. They set about to think 
and act. This change in a few 
characterizes the beginning of the 
so-called change in temper of the 
people.
Unfortunately for this country 
the three foremost men engaged in 
this work are natives of England, 
Shaw, Wells and Russell. It would 
seem that we have no great figure 
heads who peer into the future 
while at the same time working 
along somewhat different lines but 
all are leading in the same direc
tion, a more sane and reasonable 
system of living. Wells is one of 
the foremost men in this work and 
calls change in temper the open 
Conspiracy. Shaw is definitely mold
ing current thought, and so is Rus
sell. 1
Night Engineers 
To Hold Banquet
The next function to be 
sponsored by the Night College 
of Engineering will be held on 
March 11. The plans have been 
changed from a dance to the an
nual banquet which this college 
holds, and which was postponed 
from the Christmas holidays.
The officers of the college are 
working on a program to have this 
banquet as successful as any held 
by the college. The cost of the 
assessment will be kept to the 
minimum, but the quality of the 
affair will not be affected. Tickets 
will be distributed shortly. Note 
down in your hand book March 11 
and make tne necessary reseivations. More details will he given 
in later issues of the Tartan.
Queer what ideas people can 
get into their heads. I am still 
thinking of the pepped up gasoline. 
Wouldnt it be a grand sight to 
the night students chasing around 
Schenley Park with pepped up gas
oline. Wouldnt need the slip stick 
to figure out where they got it. I 
am anxious to see what will happen 
to the bill when it reaches con
gress. Maybe some 'of the sena
tors and congressmen need some of 
the intoxicated pep to help them 
along.
About the end of this week there 
Will be a large number of night 
students riding on the planet Mars. 
At least that is the inference I 
could gather from the conversa
tions heard recently. I am going 
to try to get in on the affair even 
if I have to look out from Jupiter 
or Saturn. I am sure it will be a 
great party. Certainly will be en
tertaining even if for no other rea
son than to see what other peo
ples ideas are about Mars and her 
inhabitants. If you have been in 
the Arts Building the \past week 
you would know that something 
was about to happen from the net 
work of wires and scaffolding erect
ed to hold the contraptions. Every
one over there is agog  about the 
affair.
The Night Council is also getting 
in the lime light with their annual 
Washingtons Birthday Dance 
which I notice from the handbook 
is scheduled for February twentysecond. How strange, they both 
should fall on the same daybut 
then that is Washingtons Birth
day isnt it. I have been at the 
two previous affairs and had a fine 
time, so I am looking forward to 
this next affair with anticipation. 
Hope I see all my working friends 
there.
True Love is the title given to 
the next issue of Puppet. Ill bet 
that Is a ding hummer. I have lost 
out on the last two issues as they 
were all sold when I went to get 
my copy. Ill fool them this time 
and buy mine from the first sales
man I see.
For the past few days, the pa
pers have not. carried anything con
cerning tho much written about 
technocracy. It is a littlo refresh
ing to be able to get away from a 
subject which has bedn constantly 
before us for some time. The pa
pers were full of tho idea. And, 
not to Iio cutdone. out at Carnegie

Japan and League 
Play Quiet Game
The game of tag, with Japan 
hiding, and the Leugue of Nations it, is progressing nicely, 
feeneva has devised new methods 
of stalling for time, Japan is hold
ing her gains, China, is going bank
rupt keeping an army in the field 
and, as usual, our fair nation is out 
on a limb, wishing it had minded 
its own business, but too proud to 
admit it.
Hitlers recent rise to power in 
Germany has startled the League 
into some form of action and many 
nations, whose viewpoints were 
hazy, have now definitely had to 
take a stand, in view of the little 
Nazis ideas about things.
Lets hope that this recent 
change of attitude will result in 
quick action for, as long as the 
matter rests where it is, there are 
too many explosive possibilities 
connected with the whole busi
ness. And, if we interpret foreign 
comment right, America would 
seem to be on the spot just as 
long as the argument continues un
settled.
Notify Staff of
Changed Address
From time to time the circula
tion department of the Tartan re
ceives notice that the weekly is not 
being delivered to some of the 
night students. Upon investigating 
it has been found in most cases 
that the complaint comes from stu
dents who have not filed a mailing 
address, or if they did, their ad
dress has been changed and no no
tice of the change has been sent to 
the staff office.
When night students register 
mailing address is provided for 
them on the registration blank and 
unless this blank is filled oui by 
the student no paper can be sent. 
The Plaid will assume that all stu
dents are receiving the Tartan un
less advised to the contrary.

Nu Sigma Alpha 
Initiates Eighteen
Terminating a period of pledging 
and informal initiation, Nu Sigma 
Alpha fraternity welcomed eight
een night students into the organ
ization -when the initiation Titual 
was administered on Saturday 
evening, January 28. The pledges 
had been undergoing a series of 
tests which would eventually qual
ify them for full membership and 
when the final time arrived the 
new men were eager to become 
members.
Gathered at the banquet table 
spread in the beautiful banquet hall 
of the Carnegie Inn were the two 
faculty members of the organiza
tion, Professors Robert B. Leighou, 
and H. K. Kirk-Patrick and the 
largest group of members ever as
sembled to witness a formal initia
tion. Professor Leighou gave a 
very fine talk on the loyalty to our 
school and alma mater and Pro
fessor Kirk-Patrick reminisced 
on some of his experiences while 
abroad and his meeting up with 
Carnegie students in the most un
expected place.
Following the banquet, the new 
men were prepared for the ritual. 
Those who assumed the abligations of the organization were: C. 
R. Brown, B. D. Cametti, R. K.

No Classes in Session 
Feb. 22, School Holiday
Washingtons Birthday, February 
22, is a school holiday, therefore 
there will be no classes in session 
either in day school or night, 
school. Night student should 
make a note of this and arrange 
to attend the dance, which is 
scheduled for that evening in the 
mens gymnasium.
February 22 means more to the 
average night student than just a 
date or a holiday. It is the day 
on which the annual Washingtons 
Birthday dance is held and what 
an-evening this is going to be.
On that night the Night Student 
Council will launch its third 
dance of the season and from all 
indications it will be a huge suc
cess. Council dances are never 
anything else, but this one prom
ises to out-do all its predecessors.
The social chairman assures us 
that he and the committee will 
have something new and different 
to contribute to the gayety of the 
evening and that the gymnasium 
will be decorated for the occa
sion, entirely different from any 
previous function. Knowing the 
ability of these hard workers we 
are sure that the student body is 
in for a surprise.
To further prove their conten
tion that the evening will be one 
long to be remembered, the chair-, 
man has announced the selection 
of Will Ryshanek and his N. B. C. 
orchestra to furnish the music for 
the occasion. Little need be said 
of the ability of this musical group. 
Will and his boys will be remem
bered as having furnished some 
of the best music ever heard on 
the night campus last year. Since 
that time he has played over the 
N. B. C. hookup and has broadcast 
many radio programs over radio 
station KDKA. His orchestra has 
been in great demand and the com
mittee has been very fortunate in 
securing his services  for this af
fair. His appearance will mark 
the second time this year that a 
famous radio orchestra has fur
nished music for our dances.
Since the event falls on a night 
on which there is no school, it is 
expected that the affair will *be 
well attended. Signs already In
dicate that a capacity attendance 
will be on hand.
Tickets are now in the hands of 
all the night school salesmen and 
all students who have not already 
secured their tickets are urged to 
do so. The assessment for the af
fair is as usual $1.00, well within 
the reach of every one.
The council has invited the fol
lowing faculty members to be the 
guests and act as chaperons for 
the evening: Mr. and Mrs. J. B.
Ellis, Mr. and M,rs. D. M. GoodfelWage Cut Prevents 
Business Revival
One of the leaders of the steel 
industry recently declared against 
further wage cuts, saying that the 
workman had already borne his 
share of the burden. While it must 
be admitted that wage cutting was 
the onty salvation of many organ
izations, it is equally true that 
some companies carried the process entirely too far. In fact, some 
of the most drastic 'cuts were 
entirely unwarranted.
It was further stated by the same 
party that additional cuts, irre
spective of what industry is af
fected, will only result in greater 
price cutting and smaller volume 
of orders. It is only natural since 
a buyer will feel that any reduc
tion In manufacturing . costs ef
fected by wage cuts should be re
flected in lower prices. And, in 
many cases, the buyer will with
hold an order for an indefinite 
period, waiting for the inevitable 
drop in prices following an ex
pected wage reduction.
It is to be hoped that the logic 
of the foregoing statements will 
go far towards preventing any fur
ther cutting of wages which are 
already too inadequate.

Art Dance Draws 
Crowd; Affair is 
Very Successful
Deep snow and cold, biting 
winds are no barriers to the suc
cess of a Night Arts dance. The 
hejuvenation of Night Arts stu
dents despite these adverse con
ditions proved to be a tremendous 
success last Saturday at Thistle 
Hall. This copyrighted process 
was so inviting and pleasuresome 
that a state of mirth and glee 
reigned supremo throughout the 
evening.
The simple dignity of Thistle 
Hall was a most appropriate set
ting for this affair. Diffusing rays 
of light from overhead reflectors 
created a most entrancing tinted 
mist, so symbolic of night student 
atmosphere.
A new innovation in the dec
orative scheme was the arrange
ment. of spot, lights, so as to form 
an interesting pattern above the 
entrance to the hall. Other spots 
designed to throw shafts of light 
upon the darkened dance floor cre
ated a most unusual effect. A huge 
heart design served as an appro
priate background for the , orches
tra and a reminder of the coming 
holiday.
Boccliicchio and his Venetian 
Serenaders, who furnished the 
music for the occasion, proved to 
be a drawing card. This music 
unit has completely reversed its 
original style and has adopted a 
new and, fascinating rhythm, 
which has undoubtedly Avon them 
many new followers.
Forgive us if we seem boastful, 
but we cant help saying that after 
all there is nothing that compares 
with a night arts dance.

Explosion Recalls 
Local Disaster
The recent explosion of a gas 
holder in Neuenkirchen, Germany, 
recalls a similar catastrophy which 
occurred in Pittsburgh soino few 
years ago. The loss of life, and 
property damage in this recent ac
cident, however, were so enormous 
that our local explosion was quito 
inconsequential when compared 
with tho German explosion.
Tho occurrence of these gas hold
er explosions which are fortunate
ly rare have at various times, 
throughout tho worlds industrial 
districts occasioned much loss of 
life and no littlo property damage. 
The legislation that lins boon 
passed in various localities requir
ing almost tho same care and dis1 lances in installation that are roOn Saturday, January 2S, mem
bers of Phi Nu Fraternity gath
ered .in tho Dutch room of the 
Fort Pitt Hotel 'to welcome into 
the fraternity six new members. 
Five undergraduate night stu
dents, John Horuak, Edgar A. 
Hendershot, Roy O. Knight, Hu
bert H. Krebs and Robt. A. Woods, 
were honored by calls to member
ship, and Dalziel McKelway, as
sistant to the registrar at Car
negie Tech, accepted an invitation 
to become a special associate of. 
Phi Nu.
In an impressive ceremony Mr. 
McKelway was officially placed, in 
lus new position and. at the same 
time the fraternity members were 
impressed with the sterling qual
ities and determination of this 
new addition to their organization.
The entertainment for tho eve
ning consisted of singing, selec
tions by the .orchestra and a talk 
by Karl B. Weber, a graduate of 
the night course, in architecture. 
Webers talk was the first of a 
series of such features in which 
various members are going to tell 
about unusual and interesting per
sonal experiences. In all it was an 
enjoyable evening, and even tho 
pledges could enjoy parts of tho 
entertainment.
Now that examinations aro over 
and we have found whore wo 
stand, it is a good time to check 
up 011 ourselves and plan for tho 
rest of tho year. If wo have al
ready done well, perhaps wo might 
do better. If we have not shown 
to ourselves that wo have done 
our best, now is the time to buck 
up and get our plans in good work
ing order so that the second sem
ester will be more gratifying than 
the first, as far as results go.
It has been very pleasing to noto 
that the grades of most classes 
have been very satisfactory, inoro 
so, in fact, than in better times. 
Perhaps it is because of fewer so
cial obligations. 01* it may bo mere
ly an outflai'o of the spirit that 
makes us willing to sacrifice our 
spare time to get an education, and 
an indication that wo just wont 
be stopped.
If you made good grades, con
gratulations, if- not, condolences, 
but irrespective of what Is past, 
lets all get together and give tho 
faculty a big shock at tho end of 
this semester by showing them 
what we really can do if we try.
To be sure, times are bad, and 
we have all sorts of worries, but 
why not bury ourselves in our 
studies and try to forget? Worry
ing wont help in the loast, and 
the good results that an honest 
effort will make perhaps givo 
many of us a new grip on ourselves 
and a firmer determination to 
carry on.

Property damage, when compar

but tho timo may como whon even 
this unfortunate loss may bo pre

The assorted rabbits, babies, carrots, cabbages, rib
bons and other magical props are not created by 
magic. The tub has a false bottom that is conveniently 
displaced, and numberless wonderful things spring to 
life in the magicians nimble fingers. They do liter
ally spring because they are made to compress into 
the bottom of the tub, taking their natural shape as 
the magician lifts them out.

Tricks are legitimate on the stage but not 
in business. Heres one that has been used 
in cigarette advertising...the illusion that 
blending is everything in a cigarette.
SoNrHwHhaCwi Blending is important...but 
it makes a lot of difference what is blended.
Inferior tobaccos can be blended to cover 
up their humble origin. But your taste soon 
detects the trick.
The proper use of blending is to bring
Copyright, 1933, B. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
out the full round flavor of mild, highgrade tobaccos. Its the costliness of the 
tobaccos, as well as the blending, that counts.
It is a fact, well known by 
leaf tobacco experts, that 
Camels are made from finer, MORE 
EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other 
popular brand.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have 
been spent by others in the attempt to 
discover just how Camels are blended. 
The blend is important.
But all the while Camel spends millions 
more for choice tobaccos... to insure your 
enjoyment.
Light up a Camel. Relax, while the deli
cate blue smoke floats about you. Enjoy 
to the full the pleasure that comcs from 
costlier tobaccos.
Keep Camels always handy...in the air

Give Your Support!
One week from next Saturday night, Februar# 25, the Wo
mens Scholarship Organization will sponsor its annual benefit 
at the Syria Mosque. At that time Verdis famous Italian 
opera, lligoletto, will be sung by the International Opera Com
pany. George Trabert, Pittsburgh, tenor and former Carnegie 
student, is returning from Europe to make his debut as the 
Duke. It is only on rare occasions that students are given 
an opportunity to witness such a production.
This presentation ol! Eigoletto marks the culmination of 
one of the mostworth1while movements on the campus this year 
the Womens Scholarship Organizations drive for funds. The 
.groups annual benefit is the embodiment of a plan conceived 
some years ago when a group of students manifested a desire 
to help, some of the less fortunate students obtain an education. 
The undertaking places tremendous responsibilities upon the 
undergraduate group of women who are giving generously of 
their time and energy that the benefit may be a sueccss.
Friends of the school are responding wholeheartedly to 
. their appeal, and it is hoped that the students will respond in 
a 3iIce manner. To the student there is a glamor connected with 
college life that can be attributed, no doubt, to the social, ath, letic, and other activities which hold a certain position in the 
program, of every institution of learning. Because of this, we 
: are apt to forget that there are many students who. are upend
ing all. of their available time earning part or all ol! their col
lege expenses. This year there is an exceptionally large num
ber of women struggling against terrific odds to stay in school 
and. it is through the Womens Scholarship Organization that 
it will, be possible for some of these women to be aided.
Today the campus sale ol! tickets opens. Let it be hoped 
that the student body will give liberal, support to this years 
undertaking.
A Commendable Action
By eliminating the middleman in orchestra booking, the 
Student Council has demonstrated its willingness to take steps 
toward reducing dance admission prices and eliminating much 
oP the usual routine work connected with orchestra booking. 
In the future, all. booking ol! orchestras for large dances will 
be handled through a Stud on I; Council committee, which will 
act as the agent between the dance 'committee and the national 
booking agent or the manager of the orchestra. Under the 'new 
arrangements, the dance committoe will select the orchestra it. 
desires and the Council, committee will handle the booking de
tails. To further aid the committees, the now ruling calls for 
the compilation of .information about orchestras, which will be 
filed in the Student Council office.
This notion of the Council is not to be interpreted as a ro/lootion on any ol! the dance eommittoos,- Bather, it is a definite 
move to dispens with the unnecessary go-betweens and to net 
up a direct channel for booking. !lt should be possible to nave 
considerable money in securing nationally-known orchestras, 
and this saving, in turn, should result-in a reduction in admis
sion i trices.
Tlio preposterously high prices which are still demanded 
by nationally-known orchestras are not in keeping with other 
depression prices. Orchestras which have built up national 
reputations are in a position to ask large sums, but it is Home-. 
 times hard to see much difference between the music of a $200 
and a .$600 orchestra. Figured in the amount usually paid are 
the local and the national booking agents commissions. Strip
ped of its redundant parasites, these orchestras should be ob
tainable for considerably less than is customarily paid.
The Student Council is to be complimented .for its foresight
The Halfway Mark
This issue of the Tartan is the first in the new semester, 
and in keeping with the progressive attitude adopted by the 
stall at the beginning of the school year, another mechanical 
improvement has been made. The columns in this issue have 
been made one-half inch longer in order to .give a better propor
tion to the page.
During the first semester an effort was made to carry out 
new policies. The success of these policies must be determined 
by the readers, and the staff would lilte to receive comments 
about its endeavors. Criticisms and suggestions are always 
welcome.
The columns of the Tartan are always open to student 
opinion and it is not the desire of the staff to continually reflect 
the opinions of any one individual or group of students. The 
Tartan should be a mirror of student news and student opinion, 
and with this in mind, the staff enters a new semester with re
newed energy to make the Tartan a publication that will bring 
honor to Carnegie and its student body.
TOE SURROUNDING WORLD

The world today is In the midst 
of a tremendous turmoil. In n ka

England, a legislature in . Franco 
opposed to paying their debt to 
this country, and most important 
of nil a stato of universal depres

country is squirming around in an 
attempt to better its position, even 
at til expense of another nation. 
The League of Nations has met its 
first major problem in the ShloJapanese situation.
This country' is also in a state of 
unrest. We are on the verge of in
augurating a new president. What 
his position on international* af
fairs will be is a subject for debate. 
Although Franklin D. Roosevelt 
has done a lot of talking he has not 
made very ma-ny definite statemonts.
Tlio Emperor of Japan reviewedhis troops In regal splendor as they 
nuirched past him on their victo

peoplo cheered and the drums boat 
as the thousands of soldiers 
marched past. In Russia, Stalin 
reviewed1 his comrades as they 
passed him in an endless chain 
which lasted 'for an entire . dijy. 
Tanks, guns,, mounted small quicltflre guns together with all of the 
modern war paraphernalia were ex
hibited as a symbol of Russias 
progress and security.
This all does not seem logical. 
The world is supposedly crying for 
peace and disarmament and at the 
same time nations spend millions 
for guns and battleships when their 
citizens are starving. The eternal 
self-preservation idea makes itself 
evident again and again, Yes! dis

in her department.
During the course of the evening 
there will be a room set aside for 
all those who wish to have their 
pictures taken In their costumes. 
A photographer will be there the 
entire evening for this purpose.
In order to stir enthusiasm for 
the Ball, several rally meetings 
have been held in the .Little Tlieaiter. These meetings were held 
especially for the benefit of the 
freshmen and sophomores, since 
the next Arts Ball will not he held

An organization Is established to 
settle disputes between countries 
and all of the nations think that It

just except, the nations who are af
fected by its actions. Somo say 
that the Leaguo needs some enforc

we wander In endless circles; each 
nation suspecting tlio otherSome say that economically a

thing was said before the last war. 
We say that we dont want wav, 
then the drums' beat and the trump

all arent the Japanese doing just 
that.
People honestly dread war deep 
down iu their hearts but yet this 
war sickness creeps up 011 us like 
a plague. It is a kind of a madness 
which civilization has not taught 
us haw to cure. Most of us^ really 
want peace to continue throughout 
the world and it is our sincere 
hope that our wish comes true. We 
must not hope we must act. Pub

THE ANNUAL EVENT
Once each year the entire student body pulls 
into the shell and does nothing but grind, which 
in turn makes it kind of tough on the poor guy 
that has to grind out gossip. Of course things 
arent completely at a standstill. They started a 
new game at 
Forbes I-Iall, 
Arts Ball dec
orations are in 
progress and 
so on but to 
get a typical 
picture of just 
what went on 
during the 
past week 
youve got to imagine a student studying, some
thing very much against the average engineers 
principles.*****
UNSOLVED MYSTERIES
Who was the author of that touching little note 
that wo found pinned to the door of the Hut right 
in the middle of exams? It went something like 
this, "Ducky (they mustve ment you), I cant 
be here at three, but Ill come soon as I can. 
Love will find a way, even in such trying times.
It was a cold and snowy night and the hands 
of the clock were slowly creeping on to the hour 
of four. There was much merriment within, great 
gobs of silence without. Then out of the night 
came a wanderer, bearing with him a white bun
dle which he noiselessly placed on the doorstep 
and retreated over the same path. Soon the mer
riment within ended and the guests departed. 
Several couples walked past the package not no
ticing it but soon it was discovered and brought 
into the warmth and shelter of the house.
An expectant crowd gathered for the opening 
and were very much startled at what came out. 
The mystery: How did the Delts big silk ban
ner find its way to the Betas front porch in the 
wee small hours following the Junior Prom?* * * *  *
SOLVED CAMPUS MYSTERIES
For everybody, Will I make the Deans List? 
If you missed dont worry they have two kinds 
and one is very easy to make.
Just why Jerry OToole and Hook Sample spent 
Christmas vacation in Elyria, Ohio. Vas you at 
the Junior Prom?
Heres one for you. Why did Ira Kuhn receive 
a corsage to wear to the Junior Pro'm? And 
Maxine Piekarski a nice white carnation.
How that swanky radio-victrola found its way 
into Skibo. The boys talked a downtown music 
house into letting them borrow it for a week. 
Some people have faith!
Who made those rather odd sounding records' 
that were on exhibit with the aforementioned 
radio for a short while? Yes, sir, it was Rudolph 
from behind the counter. You missed a real 
treat if you didn't see him crooning into the 
mike.*****
THE JUNIOR PROM
What a prom! Everybody was there, almost. 
Delta Skulls fresh from their banquet, debonair 
Dragons bedecked with fancy vest ribbons, had 
one left over so.Lloyd Huntley got it. The Urban 
Room made a colorful setting for the many beau
tiful growns, mostly crepes with white and the 
 lighter shades predominating. Varying tempera
tures were in order, from hot to cold and back 
again. The whole show stopped while the good 
old Skulls had their picture taken, with their best 
foot forward of course.
Those who were there reads like a list of Car

Ready, aim, fire. It looks like the Manchurian situation but its 
much nearer homo. In fact Its the Carnegie R. O. T. C. engaging in 
tactics during the war days. The cut was a veritable no-mans land, 
honeycombed with trenches such as this. Officers and men were 
quartered in temporary barracks while they received preliminary mil
itary training. All of these hastily-built structures were later torn 
down with the exception of the Y. M. C. A. building which was remodeled and Is now the Carnegie Library or popularly the Hut.__________

deciding to decorate the fraternity 
house for Christmas, got a fine 
Concolor fir at the college nur
sery, brought it back :to the house, 
and set it up in the lounge. But 
before long, the forestry depart
ment, noticing that the rare Concolor pine was gond, found out the 
guilty fraternity and notified it 
that Concolor pines cost $50. The 
brothers decided that Concolor 
pines do not add to the festive 
spirit of Christmas.
At Syracuse they take their ex

of 26 who experienced no reduc
tions as compared to 17 who re
ported cuts. Salaries in full-time 
positions in social work have been 
compared by four-year periods, and 
the interesting point in this tabula
tion appears to be that whereas 
the upper limit of the salary range 
advances markedly, the lower 
limit is much the same in each 
group. This fact is partially ac
counted for through the entrance 
of some of the older graduates into 
the field of emergency work where 
salaries are uniformly low.
The following marriages in 1932

Statistics further show that out of 
a total of 58 married graduates, 33 
are not employed outside the home 
and 25 continue to hold positions 
either for full-time or part-time; 
and of 20 who have 110 children 14

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
As the English speaking people 
grew in experience and became 
richer in thought, they quite natur
ally sought new terms with which 
to express their new' ideas. Some
times tliejr coined from their own 
words, but more frequently they, 
borrowed from one of the parent 
languages, such as Greek or Latin. 
Some of these borrowings show 
several curious results. For exam
ple, the doublets provide inter
esting speculation for the philolo
gist. They are words which ^ome 
from a common form, but which 
by the strange processes of ety
mological evolution now have dif
ferent forms and in many in
stances very different meanings. 
Who would think that the sacred 
and holy tabernacle with all of 
its refined and aesthetic connota
tions was ever in any way asso
ciated with the unholy and unre
fined tavern? The truth is, how
ever, that both come from the 
Latin taberna, meaning hut. In 
the first instance, "tabernacle is 
derived from the diminutive tabernaculum, which is quite descrip
tive of a little hut; and in the 
second instance, tavern is quite 
directly taken into English. It 
seems as if., on tjie one hand, the 
off-spring entered the ministry; 
and 011 the other, the public life 
of business and trade.
Probably even more interesting 
than these arp the biographies of 
the doublets, shirt and skirt. 
It is difficult to say when the dic
tators of fashion first brought the 
two together, but the etymologist 
finds little difficulty. in showing 
that they come from one common 
ancestor, the' German word 
scliurze, meaning apron. The 
first of the two, shirt, immi-. 
grated to England in the guise of 
"scyrte, arid in the course of 
events assumed its present form, 
in accordance with modernizing 
tendencies in spelling. The sec
ond, "skirt, leaving the same 
home, took a more northern than 
direct route to England, for it set
tled down among the Scandina
vians as skyrta; and it didnt 
appear in its present home and 
present form until sometime later.
In like manner, who would sus
pect that cancer arid chancel
lor were once acquainted; or 
"bench and bank: or dignity 
and "dainty? Such growths arid 
developments indicate how chang
ing is our language.

Wooden soldiers
in the war against decay
To conquer the forces of decay which attack 
telephone poles, scientists of Bell Telephone Lab
oratories carry on a relentless campaign.
They study many kinds of wood, test many 
preservatives. They isolate wood destroying fungi 
and insectsstudy them in the laboratorysearch 
for a practical means of combating their attack. 
They have set out armies of stub poles in Mis
sissippi, Colorado and New Jersey where altitude, 
climate and soil vary widely. At regular intervals 
they inspect these poles to learn which woods and 
preservatives are best.
Such scientific thoroughness is one reason why 
Bell System plant becomes more efficient each year. 
And why telephone service is so dependable.
