CARNEGIES GRID SEASON TO CLOSE WITH WASH-JEFF TILT AT PITT STADIUM SATURDAY
Time Honored Football 
Rivals to Battle For 
Charity
PRESIDENTS STRONG
Many Carnegie Players to 
Don Uniforms Last 
.Time
Next Saturdays postponed battle 
with W. & J. will be the twelfth 
game since the resumption of rela
tions in 1919. In the eleven games 
played since then, the Presidents have 
emerged the victors six times 
while the Tartans have two wins 
to their credit with three of the 
contests ending as tics.
In 1920, our Bowl was the scene 
of the first Carnegie . victory. The 
battle took place in a sea of mud, 
and the spectators were treated to 
one of the greatest mud fights ever 
i staged by. a Carnegie outfit. The 
Presidents boasted a fine ball club 
that year and were generally favored 
to win in a. walk. Charley West, 
star Wash-Jeff back, had romped 
through the best teams in he land 
and was expected to add to his al
ready large point total in the Car
negie game. The mud smeared, gray 
jcrscycd lads of Skibo not only held 
West in check, but played an alert 
Vfcnstve game. During the last 
vrtcr the Tartans took advantage 
a Wash-Jeff fumble to score the 
lone touchdown of the game. Al 
Irwin, now Assistant Graduate Man
ager, was the star of the game, 
handling the slippery ball in a fault
less manner from his position at 
center. I It was mainly due to his ex
cellent Way in this game that lie was 
clected ito captain the team the fol
lowing/season.
{ 1925 Game Called
The] year of 1925 took the game 
to Little Washington arid resulted'in 
a scoreless tie. Thr'u'gh''Ut-. the first 
half, the teams battled'on even terms. 
The Skibs opened the third period 
with a march down- tlie- field which 
brought the spectators to their feet. 
In the fury of excitement the old 
wood n bleachers on the West side 
of the field collapsed sending the 
occupants in a heap below. The 
game was called at this stage be
cause of the many people who were 
injured in the mishap. The final 
score entered the records as it stood 
when the play was stoppeda score
less tic.
The past two years, the Tartans 
have registered a tie and a victory 
over the old rivals. In the game 
played at Forbes. Field, the Plaids 
pounded the stubborn President team 
into submission and gained a three 
touchdown victory, winning by a 
19-0 score. Last years game resulted 
in a tie with both teams playing 
strong. football. The Carnegie play 
wjis superior but their golden op
portunity to score was lost with a 
penalty and an intercepted lateral.
Wilson is Threat
Next Saturday the Presidents will 
again go on parade with the greattest hope for victory, for such a 
result would make their season a 
successful one. The Red and Black 
outfit will present a well balanced 
team with the triple-threat star, 
Stuart Wilson. During the past sea
son Stew has won several games 
for the Presidents with his excellent 
kicking, passing, and runninghis 
successful trys for extra points be
ing the margin of- victory in both 
the Bucknell and the West Virginia 
games.

Dramatic Dept
La Princesse Lointaine 
of Rostand Opens 
Nxt Week
A new production of the depart
ment of drama, La Princesse Lointainc, by" Edmund Rostand, opens 
a week from tonight in the Little 
Theater at 8:15 oclock, and will be 
staged for a week continuously. It is 
one of Rostands earlier plays and 
was written originally for Sara 
Bernhardt.
The play is being presented in the 
Russian manner under Boris Glagolin, 
the guest director of the drama de
partment this month. Glagolin is an 
artist of the highest order, who 
adheres to the school of Russian 
Constructivism. He will be remem
bered at Carnegie for his production 
of The Gardeners Dog last Christ
mas in the Little Theater. In an 
interview given at this time, Mr. 
Glagolin explained the ideas of the 
Constructivists. I In post-Revolution 
drama, the method of the Russian 
was a complete change from the 
artificiality that had previously char
acterized the plays of the Russian 
stage. All superficiality was forgot
ten. The drama,! however, was not 
merely a mirror of the intense real
ism of the times. The producers 
kept in mind the change in the mem
bers of the audience. They were no 
longer the select few, the aristocrats, 
but now they were the masses, the 
peasants, and as such they were made 
component parts of the play on a 
basis as important as the players 
themselves. The style of acting drop
ped all effusive gesticulation, which 
was formerly thought proper, and 
brought in its place rigid restraint, 
mechanical to a point where all the 
suppressed emotion was released, not 
to the thin air, but to the heart and 
mind of the audience.
La Princesse Lointaine is a tale 
of romantic love in mediaeval days, 
in the times of the troubadors. 
Lloyd Wcningcr has designed the 
scenery .which is extremely intricate 
and elaborate, in order that it.may 
be in keeping with the setting. A 
large chorus of dancers is being 
trained under Doris Portman. The 
production will be something that 
has had no precedent in the Car
negie Little Theater. It will be en(Continucd on Page Two)

RAYMOND FOSDICK, IN REMARKABLE CARNEGIE DAY ADDRESS, PORTRAYS 
BUSINESS DEPRESSION AS A MALADY INHERENT IN THIS ECONOMIC WORLD
Declaring that we are trying to 
run a 20th Century industrial world 
with 18th Century political ideas, 
Raymond B. 'Fosdick, 'New York 
lawyer and publicist, addressed the 
students ana faculty of the Car
negie Institute of Technology at the 
annual Carnegie Day exercises held 
in the Carnegie Music Hall.
The World Is Sick
The world is very sick. It is a 
world that engineers and technolo
gists have created. They have given 
us radios, telegraphs, airplanes, auto
mobiles, and other marvelous methods 
of transport. Their gifts have knit 
the world together into a new kind 
of unity. They have made -possible 
the whole organization of produc
tion and distribution on a gigantic 
scale. They have increased the stand
ard of living far beyond even the 
dreams of our fathers. They have 
resulted in higher wages, shorter 
hours, lower prices, and larger pro
ducts. And yet, I repeat, the world 
we live in today is very sick. If 
anyone doubts this assertion,' let him 
feel the pulse and take the tempera
ture of our present civilization.
Depression Widespread 
All over the world production is 
declining, commodities arc falling, 
bankrupts arc increasing and the 
figures of the unemployed arc mount
ing, almost multiplying. From twelve 
to fifteen million men are today 
walking the streets all the way from 
Washington to Australia looking for 
a chance to work. In a world that 
is bursting with goods, that has limit
less capacity to produce, we are 
haunted by this spectre of compul
sory' idleness with its fingers on the 
throat of our industrial life.
Mr. Fosdick, in speaking on The 
International Implications of the 
Economic Depression, deplored the 
fact that the United States still
clings to the idea that it can maintain 
political insolation in a world in 
which economic isolation has disap
peared. Citing the-rush of trade 
and finance that has blotted out geo
graphical lines, the speaker said : 
Everywhere economic forces have 
broken through old barriers and are 
seeking common levels- Around the 
world prosperity and depression keep 
the same rhythm. There are no good 
times that can be confined to one 
country and no bad times that can be 
permanently isolated. / Our 20th Cen
tury industrial  world is a cogged 
machine; and President Hoover in
adequately portrays the situation, it 
seems to me, when lie is- led to say, 
as he did in his addrer.s before the 
American Bankers Association : We 
can make a very large degree of re
covery independently of what may 
happen elsewhere.
Suggests Tentative Reforms 
Now, I have no doubt that there 
are many things that could be done 
and are being done here in the 
United States which would and will 
improve our internal situation. The 
revision of our anti-trust laws as 
suggested by Mr. Thomas W. Lamont, with their unfortunate con
sequences in terms of duplication of 
plant and equipment, ' might very 
materially encourage o r economic 
recovery. The repeal of our recent
ly enactcd tariff law with its vicious 
boomerang against our national trade 
would undoubtedly help. The estab
lishment of a National Industrial 
Planning Board, as outlined by Mr. 
Stuart Chase, which would act as 
an economic general staffa factgather and adviser both for govern
ment and industry i relation to every 
major economic undertakingmight 
be of great assistance in articulating 
the development of business and thus
meeting the challenge of the Rus
sian formula. Similarly, we could 
and probably should have legisla
tion establishing a nationaj_. system 
of employment exchanges, unemploy
ment insurance, advance planning of 
public works, and other emergency 
remedies.
Advocates International Economic 
Laws
But when you have eliminated all 
the legal obstacles to industry in 
this country, and have set up all the 
machinery you tan think of for its 
stimulation and emelioration, the 
germs of the disease will still be 
alive in the world; and other epi
demics, probably of increasing fre
quency and severity, will sweep 
across our boundaries and prostrate 
us again.
How can we expect to maintain 
our industrial health when we are 
linked like Siamese twins to nations 
in which industrial disease is ramppant?
I have no special competence'to 
answer these questions. My only sug
gestion might be that we might try 
to adapt our political ideas and ac
tions to our new economic inter
nationalism.
"The fundamental difficulty with 
our present situation is that two 
distinct principles are struggling for 
mastery. In spite of the fact that 
the economic tides are overflowing 
the world, we are still trying to 
maintain our old nationalistic water
tight compartments. Our political con
ceptions have not caught up with 
our machines. The - band has got
ten far ahead of the procession. In 
a new age of- interdependence we 
are hugging desperately our old 
definitions of sovereignty.
U. S. Unwittingly Out-of-Date
It all comes to this: we are try
ing to run a 20th Century industrial 
world with 18th Century political 
ideas. The tremendous technical revo
lution of the last hundred jears has 
as yet made little impression upon 
our institutions or social beliefs. The 
United States, for example, con
tinues to live in the intellectual at
mosphere of Jeffersonian individual
ity. Its administrative system is 
roughly the same as it was in the 
days of Jackson. Its philosophy of 
international- relations is inherited 
from' Hamilton. It repeats the Dec
laration of Independence as if noth
ing has happened since 1776.
Obsolete Political Policy Prevails 
The United States is trying to 
live in two different worlds at the 
same time. A leader in everything 
that relates to the technical aspects 
of economic interdependence, it re
fuses to face up to the political im
plications of its own acts. It does 
not easily grasp the fact that this 
new world of specialization and 
mutual dependence cannot live side by 
side with a world of Monroe Doctrines 
and tariff wars. It does not seeat 
least it will not admitthat the 
advice contained in Washington's 
Farewell Address is as obsolete as 
the stage coach in which he rode 
/rom New York to Philadelphia.
A Change Necessary 
We must bring our politics 
abreast with our economy. We must 
bridge, the gulf which our machines 
have made between politics and 
economics. Our enormous potential 
consumption capacity will certainly 
assist recovery but .he attacks will 
come again. They will come with 
increasing severity, for some of the 
medicine which has been suggested 
will be bitter. But there seems to 
be no other method of permanent 
cure. And the world is very sick.

Tartan Marksmen Begin Drill Today In Renovated Ran^e
IT SEEMS THAT GOOD FOOTBALL WEATHER js 
not to be expected any more 'this year. The postponement of 
the W. & J. tilt until next Saturday seemed a wise move at the 
time, but from all indication^ 01* Man Winter intends to hold j 
his sway.
The* postponement was justified by the meager possibilities 
of a good attendance which seemed inevitable last week-end. 
It was hoped that the inclement spell would give way to better 
grid weather and that a larger attendance would add to the 
gate receipts which are to go toward the benefit of the un
employed, so that the Graduate Managers had in mind the 
welfare of the unfortunates at the time. The game, however, 
will be of interest to more than the unemployed in that it marks 
the closing of careers for twelve Carnegie griddcrs including 
Captain Dreshar, /Dutch" Eyth, Karcis, Rosenzweig, Highberger, Pete and Slats" Flanagan, Selinuppe, Morbito, Carlson, 
Ivrack and Sketres, which means that next years team will be 
less experienced as a whole than the '30 combination.
Saturdays game will be well worth seeing regardless of 
the weather conditions because of the rivalry which exists be
tween the contenders and because it affords the last opportunity 
to. witness the play of so many mainstays whom we have 
followed through four years of Tartan football.
**** 41
LAST YEAR THE ATHLETIC COUNCIL APPOINTED 
BUZZ" HOGAN to assume the duties of basketball coach 
at Carnegie. Hogan, who played guard at Iowa University and 
who was named on the Big 10 All-Conference Team, was chosen 
from numerous applicants for the job.
With the coming of a new mentor, many cage fans expected 
a miraculous change in the tide of the court game for the 
Tartans, and when the basketeers.didnt win every tilt, the new 
coach, of course, was to blame. They seemed to forget that 
material even entered into the making of a championship team, 
and that such a change in affairs would necessarily require some 
time and experimentation. Although the scores turned in did 
not indicate an especially successful season, the work of the new 
coach was generally considered to be very satisfactory by those 
who were in a position to review the season with a critical eye.
This year, however, Coach Hogan will present one of the 
best floor teams ever to represent Carnegie. True, the material 
with which lie has to work is exceptionally good, but good 
material must be well coached, and judging from the practice 
games thus far, Hogan has proved himself a capable and worthy 
mentor.
The season opens during the Christmas vacation, so that 
by the time school resumes, the cagcrs will be well under way. 
(t will be interesting to follow the team and Coach Hogan 
through this season, which might justly be expected to be one 
of the Tartans best.
WITH THE COMPLETION 01- THE REMODELING 
which has been going on for some time in the basement of 
Margaret Morrison, the Plaid' ritiers will get under way for a 
two weeks concentrated practice. The renovated range,- we 
arc told, will be one of the best among eastern schools, includ
ing the Naval Academy at Annapolis.
Few upper classmen, and practically no freshmen know how 
the riflers meet the teams of other schools. Although the 
schedule calls for several shoulder-to-shouldcr matches in which 
the two teams meet and shoot; it out on the same range, the 
majority of the matches are carded for a comparison of scores 
only. Each, team shoots its targets under supervision on its 
own range and the scores are telegraphed or mailed to the 
competing team for comparison, so that the Tartans might shoot 
against schools over the entire country. .Ride, in that way, is 
ii unique sport.
It might be of interest to those who have never visited the 
range, or who know little about the sport to drop around some 
evening and watch the marksmen. The Ride Club, an organiza
tion to promote interest in the target game and to help furnish 
equipment for the range, is open to all. Membership it) the 
Club carries with it the privilege of using the range during 
scheduled practice hours with targets and ammunition supplier!

A HUMOROUS CONTRIBUTION
Golf is a form of work made expensive enough for a rich man to 
enjoy it. It is physical and mental exertion, made attractive by the 
fact you have to dress for it in a $200,000 Clubhouse.
Golf is what letter carrying, ditch digging and carpet beating would 
be if those three tasks had to be performed on the same) hot afternoon 
in short pants, and colored socks by gouty looking gentlemen who 
required a different implement for cach mood.
Twenty-five years ago there was one golf club to a community. 
Today there is one to a block. This shows what can be done with a 
sport, once you create the idea that two blackballs will be sufficient 
to keep any man out of it.
Golf is the simplest looking game in the world when you decide to 
take it up, and the toughest looking after you have been at it for 10 
or 12 years. \ 
It is probably the only known game a man can play as long as a 
quarter of a century and then discover that it is too deep for him in the 
first place.
The game is played on carefully selected grass with little white 
balls and as many clubs as the player can afford. These balls cost 
75 ccnts to $2.50 and it is possible to support a family of 10 people 
(all adults) for five months on the money represented by the balls lost 
by some golfers in a single afternoon.
A golf course has 18 holes, 17 of which are unnecessary and put 
iq to make the game harder, A "hole is a tin cup in the center of a 
"green. A "green is a small parcel of grass costing about $1.98 a 
blade and usually situated between a brook, a couple of apple trees and 
a lot of unfinished excavations.
The idea is to get the golf ball from a given point to each of the 
18 cups in the fewest strokes a-ud the greatest number of words. The 
.illy thing about it all Is that after you have been all afternoon poking 
the ball around the lot you find that the eighteenth hole is right in 
tront of the clubhouse from which you started,
The ball must not be thrown, pushed or cnrrlcd. It must be pro
pelled entirely by about .$200 worth of curious looking implements, 
especially designed to provoke the owner.
Each Implement has a specific purpose and utlimatcly some golfers 
get to know what the purpose ii. They are the exceptions.
After the final or eighteenth hole the golfer adds up his score and 
stops when he has reached 87. He then has a swim, sings "Sweet 
Adalinc" with six or eight other liars and calls It the end of a perfect 
da /.
The initial rifle practice of the 
year will be held this afternoon in 
the basement of Margaret Morri
son on the nevC'ly remodeled range. 
Practice sessions have been held back 
this year due to the improvements 
that were being made on the range 
during the .past few weeks and now 
only two weeks remain for the 
varsity shooters to get in shape 
for their opening competitive match 
which is scheduled immediately 
after Christmas vacation.
All men who have any intention 
of going, out for the team should 
report to the range as near 4:30 
this evening as possible. New can
didates are, particularly urged to 
try out, for the team and all those 
who were on last year's Varsity 
and Freshmen squads are expected 
to report tonight in order that rifles 
may be assigned and practice ses
sions can get under way without 
delay.
All assistant managers are ex
pected to be on hand and all can
didates for the job of rifle man
ager are requested to report to the 
range this evening. The riile team 
affords an excellent opportunity for 
freshmen desiring to become man
agers, and those reporting this 
evening will be candidates for var
sity manager, which position car
ries with it the awarding of a var
sity letter.
Candidates should remember that 
at the opening of the season there 
is often a number of inexperienced 
men on the range and that it is 
especially important that all safety 
rules should be strictly adhered to. 
Both loaded and unloaded rifles 
are to be kept pointed at the tar
gets while on the firing line* Be
fore leaving the firing line all bolls 
should be opened. Accidents arc 
inexcusable and all safety meas
ures sho.uld be followed closely.
Anyone interested in rifle work 
should join the Carnegie Rifle Club, 
an organization formed for the pur
pose of promoting interest in 
shooting and to help furnish equip
ment for the range. Membership 
in this organization carries with it 
Hit/ privilege of using the rang* 
during the scheduled practice hours 
and the club furnishes its members 
with targets and ammunition dur
ing these periods. The club has 
been a valuable asset in develop
ing material for the championship 
teams of the past and it is hoped 
that any freshmen with aspirations 
to become marksmen will take ad
vantage of the opportunities which 
the rifle club offers. Anyone who 
wishes to join the club can do so 
by reporting to the range any 
afternoon during practice sessions.
The following list gives the 
schedule of practice hours and the 
assistant managers in charge:
Monday5:30-6:00, Achley.

Subterranean Hockey
The outstanding difference be^ 
tween ice hockey as we played it at 
Dartmouth back in 1867 and your 
modern hockey," writes Corey Ford, 
"The Grand Old Man of Hockey," 
in the January College Humor, is 
that in our days wc never had ice; 
As a result, due to the weight of( 
our skates, most of the game was 
necessarily played under water. To 
be sure, this method of playing
hockey had its disadvantages, such  
as drowning, but on the other, Hand i 
there were several distinct ad
vantages of our method over the 
modern version. In the first place, 
the fact that the water was not 
frozen made it a great deal warmer 
and consequently wc did not have 
to wear so many thicknesses of long 
woolen underwear under our hockey 
uniforms, thus speeding up the game 
considerably. In addition, the soft 
surface of the water saved us many 
a nasty bump on the forehead when 
tripping over an extended hockey 
stick. Chilblains in my day were 
virtually unheard of.
'The idea of freezing the water in 
the rink first occured in 1849. Up to 
that time the majority of the games 
naturally took place on the bottom 
of the rink, but spectators began to 
complain that it was almost impos
sible to follow. the finer points of 
the contest. Various experiments were 
tried in an attempt to freeze ice, 
including artificial refrigeration (cool
ing the water by pouring it into a 
saucer), building all hockey rinks 
hereafter in some cold country like 
Baffin Land (a method Which was 
later abandoned owing to the dif
ficulty of transporting audiences to 
watch the games), or tossing in 
lumps of ice until, the water in the 
pool reached a point where it would 
freeze itself. The rink at Dartmouth 
was frozen in this j.. iner and was 
the first all-ice rink in America."

gressing, and from all appearances 
will reach the goal of six hundred 
dollars, set 1927 in the original
Dollar Day .1 by John L. Por

This annual drive affords a chance 
for all alumni and former students 
to contribute one dollar toward the 
endowment fund. The "two for one" 
plan whereby the Carnegie Corpora
tion has agreed to pay the school 
eight million dollars in 1946, pro

before that time, should be remem

The campaign closes on December 
15, so that there is still plenty of 
time for those desiring to add to 
the Fund. Make all checks payable

NIGHT ARTS DANCE, 
CARNEGIE UNION, 
DECEMBER f>
Thanksgiving has come and gone, 
at least, as far as the day is con
cerned, but it should, and. with me 
it does, in fact, linger on and on. 
Just think what a wonderful school 
we have on the edge of Schenley. 
Isn't that something to be thankful 
for? And then when we night-stu
dents look at the advan&ges which 
we have at our disposalisnt that 
something more to.be thankful for? 
' I know there arc some who will 
say that we do have a tough time 
of it, but look how much more will 
be derived from the sacrifices which 
are made, and how much, more the 
obtaining will. be appreciated and 
valued, at the extra cost of time 
and effort. - Take for instance wthe 
large enrollment which we have this 
year. This indicates that we surely 
.must have something worth while 
to attract such a large number. 
Constantly . improvements and 
changes are being made and we are 
benefiting by them. We have the 
Shelter and the Traffic Lights at 
The Cut/ which add in no small 
way to our comfort. Many other 
things have also been accomplished 
during the past year on the cam
pus, which should impel us to unite 
in orip thought of Thanksgiving.
The twenty-fifth anniversary of 
the founding of our college has 
been fittingly observed during the 
past week and it is a coincidence 
hat. it should come during the 
\ "hanksgiving season. When we 
(intemplate on the wonderful 
gnwth our institution has had in 
thee 25 years, starting from 
Vs.ci?.tch" until  now, one of the 
leadhg colleges in the country, 
this 'ars group should look back 
with icle at this wonderful record, 
and b*. thankful that they were en
abled fo enroll as night students 
in -such a glorious institution and 
forcv.eil s"1 the praises of Fair 
Carnegie:
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater
Stands for progress, peace and 
' right!
Do you remember any of the 
scenes and pictures which appeared 
in the last issue of the Tartan? 
Do they ,bring back any memories? 
Yes. there are some former night 
students who are thrilled at seeing 
these pictures once again. Do you 
remember the annual hatchet trarlition of the student body when 
the campus-citizens donned the re
galia incidental thereto? Does it 
' not give you a feeling of pride to 
say that in the progress which has 
been made our group, the night 
students, has organized and estab
lished an exceedingly successful 
student organization * the Night 
Student Councilan. organization, 
now in its seventh year, which has 
always endeavored to promote the 
welfare of Carnegie.'

The first dance of the year to be 
sponsored by the Night College of 
Fine Arts will be held on Decem
ber 6 in the Union. Everything points 
to a'very successful affair. The com
mittee in charge of the party was 
announced in last weeks issue of the 
Tartan, and the majority . of these 
students arc veterans 011 night school 
work.
Music will be furnished by En. 
Bocchicchio and his troupe, and this 
is all that is needed to make a dance. 
You simply can't keep your feet 
still. Dancing will be from 9:00 until 12 midnight.
Novel decorations have been de
cided upon and other surprises too 
so be sure to attend if you are a 
regular Night Art Student. Tickets 
are being distributed by the Commit
tee to those holding a registration 
card all this week.
For the information of the new 
night art students the Union is on 
the third floor of the Administration 
Hall. If you attend one- of these 
affairs you arc sure to be present 
at all the others.
NIGHT STUDENT COUNCIL 
ELECTS OFFICERS
NIGHT ARTS WORKERS 
TO BE ON HAND SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON,DECEMBER 6
All the night students in the Col
lege of Fine Arts who have been 
appointed on the Night College of 
Fine Arts Social Committee are ex
pected to be on hand Saturday after
noon, December 6, at 2^)0 o'clock in 
the Union. In addition, those Night 
College of Fine Arts students who 
have sent in their names, as wanting 
to work will be-given an opportunity 
by showing up 011 Saturday also.
At the November meeting of the 
Night Student Council the follow
ing officers were elected: James S. 
Geyser, president; William R. 
Hodder, secretary, and Edward E. 
McDonald, treasurer. The four 
representatives which each college 
elects constitutes the Night Student 
Council, and this body elects its 
own officers. 
Henry E. Mauro was appointed 
social chairman for the year 1930- 
31. James J. Leindecker was ap
pointed Night Editor and Henry E. 
Mauro was appointed Night Busi
ness manager respectively for the 
1931 Thistle.
A motion to repeal a by-law ef
fecting eligibility to Council was 
tabled. Council had received a 
large number of letters from 
night students expressing interest 
in the work of the Council and 
offering their assistance in further
ing the various projects of the 
Council. The offers were accepted 
and these night students will 
be given an opportunity to work.
The Carnegie Song Contest 
which is being sponsored by the 
Day Council was given the hearty 
support of the Night Student Coun
cil and approval given to any plans 
which the committee in charge may 
adopt.
The attention of Council was 
caller- to the fact that-some of its 
actions were being misrepresented 
to the student body and took steps 
to stop this practie by a motion 
to this effect.
A request to change the book 
store schedule and move the open
ing hour forward in order to en
able students to purchase books be
fore classes was presented bj' Coun
cil to the Administration.

MORE WET WEATHER
Professor Hill, head of the Chemis
try Department at Yale, was faced 
with the embarrassing fact that the 
grain alcohol of the department was 
disappearing too rapidly, not through 
regular physical or experimental chan
nels', but; rather down the gullets of 
graduate .students . and, research fel
lows.
As a preliminary to taking severe 
action, the professor warned all and 
sundry that the practice was not 
only unlawful, but a distinct breach 
of faith with the University.
It is hoped that business condi
tions will be reported better by the 
New Haven bootleggers now that 
this leak will be stopped.
WASTE UTILIZATION
This phase of modern industry 
has quietly grown to amazing pro
portions. Few lUymen realize that a 
large percentage of what was once 
considered useless scrap is now be
ing reworked into not only usable, 
but highly valuable products.
Most unusual of all, however, is 
the fact that dliring the process of 
rehabilitation of scrap, many by
products are formed that are absent 
in the original process. Scrap iron 
and steel have always been con
sidered as salvage, but in recent 
years, largely through the persistent 
research work of industrial chemists, 
many other forms of waste material 
have been' utilized with more than 
gratifying results.
Many organizations devote all their 
efforts to salvage, rather than pro
duction from raw materials, due to 
high percentage of profit gained 
through the sale of the product it
self, as well, as the usually attendant 
host of by-products. A noticeable 
instance of the extent to which waste 
is prevented and turned into an 
asset is forcibly set forth by one of 
the largest explosive manufacturers 
in the world, and undoubtedly the 
largest manufacturer of this com
modity that this country boasts.

FRATERNITY has several things in 
view for the affair. The' plans are 
not as yet final but they expect to 
complete them shortly when full in
formation will be available.
ganization has been able, through the 
assistance of what is probably the 
most efficient group of research men 
in the industrial world, to perfect 
a host of by-products that have for 
their base and principal ingredient 
substances once thought worthy of 
being discarded.
Imitation ambers, celluloid, varnish* 
es, lacquers, transparent paper and 
many other well-known and widely 
used articles represent the enormous 
field that is opened by intelligent and 
persistant studies of the utilization 
of so-called waste matter. This of 
course is only one well established 
instance. Proper classification of this 
new art would require several 
ably be antiquated before the ink 
was fairly dry, du<j to the gigantic 
strides taken, and the processes de-, 
veloped almost overnight by the 
chemists.
The manufacture of sulphuric acid 
as a by-product from smelters, the 
collection of the large volumes of 
hydrogen and other gases given off 
during many commercial fermenta
tion processes are well-known and 
comparatively recent evidences of the. 
unexpected sources of valuable ma
terials that required in the past a 
well ordered industry of their own 
for their manufacture, disregarding 
the waste attendant to this manu
facture.
Hence it is seen that waste utiliza
tion not only consumes much once 
discarded matter, but also materially 
reduces the losses that wjre regarded 
as necessary to the production of the 
product from raw materials, and 
automatically becomes a conservation 
project that could not-.be deliberate
ly enforced.

Beginning this week the eve
ning hours of the book store in the 
basement of Administration Hall 
will be 6:15 to 8:45 (instead of 
7 :G0 to 9:00). It is felt that this 
change, requested by the Night Stu
dent Council, will make a better ad
justment between the hours of the 
book store and the hours of the 
students schedules.
HEAVY SCHEDULES
In line with . the modern con
cepts of mass production and 
speed, many students attempt to 
overload themselves in the matter 
of scheduled subjects. In the writ
er's knowledge there have been 
several men of promise, that have 
failed in their studies chiefly on 
account of their misguided impres
sion that they were capable of 
carrying more than seemed advis
able. In this respect, the average 
man is similar to a machine. If 
one can find the ideal operating 
speed, and the proper load, the 
efficiency of the machine is great
er in the end than if overloads and 
excessive speeds are induced.
While there arc men who can 
carry more than the average stu
dent, these student's form a class1 
by themselves, and it is not ad
mitting mental inferiority to 
choose a lighter schedule that is 
more compatible with the indi
viduals ability. It seems that 
light schedules tend to draw out 
the number of years necessary to 
the completion of a course, and, in 
a chronological sense, they do. 
But in a more material way, they 
do not.
The effccts of overwork have
much farther reaching effects than 
the average person cares to admit. 
Perhaps out  of three subjects
scheduled, the student finds that 
with his best efforts and concen
tration he is not only unable to
pass in all three subjects, but the 
material that is deserving of a
passing trade is far from standard. 
This does not take into considera
tion the effects that the grind had 
on the students physical and menI tal condition.
j From these considerations it 1 would be better to carry a lighter 
'schedule and make excellent grades 
in these few subjects, in the mean
while protecting the interests of 
physical well-being, than it would 
be to have to admit defeat in at 
least one subject, and to have the 
quality of that work done in the 
remainder of the schedule suffer.
Also, when one considers that 
we arc moved primarily by a dc*- 
sire to better our own interests in 
the way of education, in order 
that our earning power wil)\ be in
creased to the .extent where wc 
will be able to enjoy life in a bet
ter than average way, it will be 
undoubtedly better if wc take suf
ficient care of ourselves1 physically 
and mentally so that we may be 
able to appreciate fully the fruits 
of our endeavors.
McG.
Gradually things are shaping them
selves up for the Night Engineering 
Banquet which is scheduled to be 
held on December 13. A banquet hall 
has been reserved at the Fort Pitt 
Hotel in which to hold the affair. 
The price of the ticket has also been 
set, and this is to be $2.50 per
plate. 
The entertainment is being selected 
with great care, and when the de
cision has been reached it will be 
one which will leave no room for 
dissent. Other new and novel ar
rangements are being completed 
which will add to your enjoyment.
Tickets have been sent out to the 
salesmen, and the night engineering 
students should patronize these men 
who arc working to put the affair 
over in a big way. No better way
can be shown that you appreciate
their efforts than by buying a ticket 
alid then coming to the banquet. Re
member this is your annual get to
gether affair and the larger the turn
out the better success you' will have. 
Set this date aside for fun-making:; 
youll never regret it.

PLAID VS OWLS
Is
Wc live in a land bounteously en
dowed by nature with rich resources 
of those materials nccessary for the 
preservation of, life and the promo
tion of human happiness. From this 
wealth of field and mine and forest 
a great industrial civilization has 
been developed, the equal of which 
has no parallel in any previous so
ciety.
Yet, in spite of the enormous 
wealth of our country, wc behold in 
vivid contrast the poverty of the 
larger part of its inhabitants. This 
condition has become accentuated by 
the growth of ^industry. Mont of us 
have learned to accept this' poverty 
as an unavoidable evil' which we 
ourselves might escape by energetic 
effort to whatever work our hands 
and minds found to do! But the 
present economic situation of our 
country gives us cause' to"pause and 
wonder. We see 011 one side the 
great want for sufficient food, proper 
clothing, and decent homes for the 
largest part of our neighbors, We 
see 011 the .other side, great surpluses 
of raw materials to supply these 
wants, and the skilled workmen to 
fashion this material, and the trained 
minds ready to supply the technical 
knowledge. But the workmen stand 
idle, and their families suffer from 
provcrty.
If you inquire why this should be, 
you are told that there has been an 
overproduction of goods. That is, 
those who own all these resources 
and the tools for utilizing them 'no 
longer find it to their advantage to 
manufacture more goods because- the 
workmen who produced the wealth 
could buy a small portion of it back 
with their wages. So the supply of 
goods they could not purchase ac
cumulated until it was no longer 
necessary for them to produce more 
for the purpose of bringing profits 
to the owners. And now they must, 
out of their meager savings, pur
chase and use up that accumulation
A good deal of credit is due to 
the' first staff and originators of 
the Plaid for the originality mani
fested in selecting a fitting and 
descriptive liatne for the night school 
page.
Somewhat hastily gathered statis
tics show that nine out of every 
ten night school publications have 
the word Owl incorporated in the 
name. While wc must admit that 
the name- Owl is a very proper 
name for such a publication, we 
must also admit that there is some 
satisfaction in being apart from the 
crowd.
Of course every school doesnt 
have the traditions '.0 choose from 
in the same quantity as Carnegie, but 
even so, it gives a distinctive touch 
to the night school to have it in 
a name class bv itself.

of goods. When that has happened, 
the cycle will have been completed, 
prosperity will have returned, and all 
the wealth which the labor of the 
great majority of men had created 
will have become the- property of 
that small group of men who own 
the materials and machines.
Why is not all the wealth and skill 
and knowledge which exists in this 
land utilized for promoting the'good 
of all? The difficulties involved in 
effecting the social, political and 
economic changes to secure such a 
society appear hopelessly complex. 
Yet it is essential that these prob
lem be solved, and they should be 
the concern of every intelligent man. 
Let us not only train our hands and 
minds to produce wealth,but let us 
also endeavor to bring about a so
cial system such that our efforts "'ill 
be to the gain of society at large in. stead of to the profit of a few iuI dividtials. Under the present social 
j system all inventive genius and 
engineering ability has but served to 
strengthen the hands ot wealth and 
reduce the workers steadily toward 
automatism. This must be remedied.

Centuries of Light Years Distant
(TTy< MEANS of a new vacuum tube ailed a low-grid-current PlioJL) tron tube, astronomers can gather the facts of stellar news 
with greater speed and accuracy. In conjunction with a photoelectric 
tube, it will help render information on the amount oflight radiation 
and position of stars centuries of light years away. It is further 
applicable to such laboratory uses as demand the most delicate 
measurement of electric current.
So sensitive is this tube, that it can measure 0.000,000,000,000,000,01 
of an ampere, or, one-hundredth of a millionth of a billionth of an 
ampere. This amount of current, compared with that of a 50-watt 
incandescent lamp, is as two drops of water compared with the entire 
volume of water spilled over Niagara Falls in a year.
General Elcctric leadership in the development of vacuum tubes has largely 
been maintained by college-trained men, just as college-trained men are 
largely responsible for the impressive progress made by General Electric in

More About Riots
The iollowinE in a letter received from a friend of the school as a result of the 
iditorial that appeared in the Tartan on November 11, entitled "Student Riots.
November 18th, 1930.
NANCY C. NEWMAN, Editor-in-Chief,
The- Tartan,
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
My dear Miss Newman:
,  I quite agree with you that traditions are not made up of 
hoodlum tactics used in celebrating any kind of an eyent, at 
any kind of a College, and if anyone can give me a reasonable 
excuse for the inane actions of thirty or forty students in start
ing a disgraceful row with the Police and Firemen of the City, 
following last Saturday's game, I would /be very pleased, in
deed, to hear their defense.
To me the most regrettable part of the whole situation is 
that the students who were mixed up in this affair and guilty 
of really riotous acts, did not have the courage to ling up 
before Dean 1 Tarbell and own up to their participation in this 
scandalous action.
_ Two students who owned up, and who, yet, displayed a mis
taken loyalty to the other students- in the crowd, have been 
otpp^ec}1 to leav, School under suspension; they might have 
told the names of . every participant, and are still in position to 
do so, and I am just wondering if the consciences of the fellows 
who lied are not pricking them pretty sorely.
In my opinion, had the whole number of participants come 
buf frankly, and told Dean Tarbell that they were engaged in 
this affair, there is scarcely a doubt in the mind of anyone but 
that they all would have been punished lightly and none dis
missed.
As it now stands,' the lives of two really honorable men 
may be ruined for all time to come.
Think it over fellows; there is a big lesson in this incident 
for all of you.
Nothing of the type of the above ever makes traditions for 
your Institution, for your Fraternities, your Classes or* your
selves, because they are things which you would rather forget, 
and to those of you who participate and allowed your punish
ment to be centered on two of your number, .let me suggest 
chat the least you can ever do in mitigation of your error, is to 
raise your hat in deference to the names of the two. fellows who 
lost out because of this dishonor.
GROUCHO MARX A FATHER
"Only too Well do I know how a 
screaming baby can disturb a 
mans bed-life, writes Groucho 
Marx in the January College Hu
mor. I can remember, as though 
it were last Michaelmas, those days 
When I had to get up in the-mid
dle of the morning because mjr son 
took a notion to yell until lie was 
picked up. But^I cured him of 
that habit. It all came about like 
this. I was curled up in "my little 
bed one September noon, dreaming 
that St. John Ervine was chasing 
me out, of a theater with a portable 
typewriter, while Alex Woollcott, 
Hey wood Broun and Percy Ham 
mond sat in an upper box singing 
Im Just a Vagabond Lover. Sud
denly I heard my .son screaming 
and the sound saddened me. Should 
I, was the question I put to myself, 
'should I pick the brat up again 
and pace the floor? I was about 
to.-answer the customary Yes! 
when my manhood asserted itself. 
No, 1 finally replied. No! I'll 
scream for awhile and let the brat 
carry me and see how lie likes it.
,, So I began to yell. Surely 
enough, the 'baby came and picked 
me up and carried me around the 
room until I ceased making noise. 
(Maybe Im just a foolishly proud 
father, but it seemed rather wonder
ful when you realize that the lad 
 was scarcely ten months old and I 
was feeling close to a hundred.)
I repeated this performance for 
eight successive mornings, until the 
neighbors complained. You see, 
being a pretty strong fellow who 
eats his roughage every evening 
and drinks plenty of milk, I was 
able to cry about twice as loud as 
the baby. Da}r after day Id scream 
the brat would crawl out of his 
crib, pick me up and pace the 
floor.
Eventually, of course, he got 
pretty tired of the' whole business. 
And although he wasnt talking 
to me at the time, there was a 
silent understanding between us. If 
he wouldnt scream, neither would 
I. And I can only say that no 
Marx ever breaks his wordex
cept maybe to an employer, the 
landlord or a dame.
Hello Folks!
Having eaten too much turkey 
(even as you and lie), having had 
to dash wildly down the tracks in 
Youngstown to get back on the 
train, carrying my bag and bag
gage, and having returned for a 
mythical game between Carnegie 
Technical schools and Wash.-Jeff., 
this conductor is not in a very con
ducting mood. I hope Dave Genter and Bill Gcsling, the big "ad 
men, can fill up the bottom of this 
column with toothpaste ads.
The weather'man certainly play
ed a dirty trick on Buddy Overend, 
on the boys and girls who sold 
their tickets before going home for 
the holidays, on the football playeds like Ted Roscnzweig and 
Dutch Eyth who cant start their 
social season for another week, on 
the rushecs who cant mingle with 
their heroes of the gridiron for 
a while, and on me, who shoveled 
two and three-quarter tons of snow 
in two days in Cleveland, the 
Vacation City.

tinct rush a week ago Saturday. 
When "Hitlen Dale Knouse, Chief 
Vigilante, blew his ivhislle in front

distinction for having been first in 
the door of. Scobell UalU It zclas 
not, until * he rcache'd the fourth 
floor that he realized he was* in the 
wrong hall. The Theta Xis decorated 
him that same .evening.
Jimmy Leonard was first man in 
Boss "Hall, having jumped the 
gun" by about five yards. Quite 
few of the boys are still wondering 
who sent the ambulance along 
Woodlawn about thirty seconds be
fore the signal to go.
The freshman class that has been 
mentioned befo'rc, threw A dance a 
week ago Friday that made con
siderable money, upsetting fresh
man traditions on dance profits. 
Old man Pillsbury, chief Keeper of 
the Gates, was very efficient that 
evening, being very reluctant to let 
even Dean Tarbell in without a 
iticket stub.

"Out from; the Connecticut Val
ley, where Jonathan Edwards once 
held congregations terrified with 
his famous sermons on A Sinner in 
the Hands of- an" Angry God, 
emerges in our time a .college pro
fessor to tell us that the word sin 
should'be dropped from our vocab
ulary. .It is losing its scarlet color. 
Church' congregations no - longer 
see red when the pulpits denounce 
it, says Ralph W. Sockman in his 
article The Vanishing Sinner in 
the November issue of Harper?. 
All this is a good sign for it 
means that civilization has ad
vanced beyond the old, inflexible 
conception of morality as being 
adherence to a definite set of rules 
of conduct. We no longer attempt 
to define morality, but rather we 
try to explain it.
L L L
At the present time wc can dis
tinguish, quite definitely in our own 
minds, an old morality and a new 
morality. The distinction of course 
is, variable and two thousand years 
from now our customs will b: in
cluded in the old morality. Bu: 
for present purposes it seems best 
to adhere strictly to our twentieth 
century conception. Firm convic
tion and implicit faith ar.e char
acteristic of ignorance. The farther 
back we go, the stricter and less 
impeachable we . find the moral 
codes. , Men once felt they were 
under the eye of an all-powerful 
spectator . . . .The moral problem 
for each man was to make his will 
conform -to the will of God. Thi 
is what Walter Lippman say^s in 
his book, A Preface to Morals. 
A large, general, all-inclusive idea 
like' the ancient notion of God at 
one time meant security for man. 
Pie had no reason for disbelief and 
therefore found complete satisfac
tion in belief.

But utter' certainty must have 
been short-lived. Man was ever

With increased knowledge came 
doubt and unbelief. The advance 
showed that wer,e the orbit of the 
earth around the sun the size of a 
pin head, there would still be 
worlds . larger than ours eighteen 
million miles away, radical changes 
were made in the old idea of the 
personal God of man. And with 
this change came the realization of 
the .futility of trying to make a 
code of morals purely to please 
what had now become a very vague 
and indefinite- being. The differ
ence between good and evil must 
be a difference which men them
selves recognize and understand.

it must be willed out of personal 
conviction and desire. . . . The.

Will conform to^the will of God 
but to. the surest knowledge of tho 
conditions of human happiness, 
says Mr. Lippman.
The* so-called rebellious youth of 
today is merely the inevitable nroduct of increased knowledge and 
rational thinking. lie refuses- to 
accept a definite code of morals 
for he realizes that morality must 
be . adjusted to . its environment. 
The difficulty is that, having 
broken down all these time-honored 
'conventions, order has not as yet, 
been brought out of the' chaos 
which resulted. Old prejudices and. 
worn 'out- ideas must be removed, 
and all people must sooner or later 
recognize the change. It will be a 
new morality in -which a personal 
code will replace the old grjup 
morality. 'Everyone will recognize, 
the necessity of individual ethics 
and will understand and readily 
tolerate . differences in individual 
moral codes. It sounds a lot like 
Utopia, but it seems to be Ihfe 
goal toward which our present pro
gress' points.

Basking in thc only unripped

the real man glimmers through the
