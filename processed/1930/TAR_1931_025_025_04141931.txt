CARNEGIE PLANS 
ANNUAL EXHIBIT FRIDAY, APR. 24
Experimental Psychology 
Class to Be Novel 
Feature
PRES. BAKER TO RECEIVE
R.O.T.C. to Hold Parade; 
Kiltie Band to Give 
Program
With all the modern world talk
ing about psychology, and modern 
colleges and universities putting 
more and more strces on the ps3rchological reactions of individuals 
to  set conditions, the Annual Ex
hibition of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, to be held on Fri
day evening, April 24, will feature 
a demonstration of Experimental 
Psycholog3r. Under the direction 
of assistant professor Lau ranee 
Shaffer, a class in Experimental 
Psychology will be conducted in 
Margaret Morrison. A color-mix
ing demonstration showing the hues 
which result from mixing various 
proportions of primary colors will 
be giArcn. It is commonly believed 
that when blue and yellow arc mix
ed together, they give green, but 
in reality, they make gray. This 
will be proved. Color blindness 
tests will also be conducted on 
guests who suspect that they may be 
color blind. Another special test 
to be demonstrated is the Reaction 
Time experiment. The equipment 
used for this experiment measures 
the length of time taken to perform 
an act after seeing a signal. The 
apparatus used records time to 1/50 
of a second.
Students to Work
On Exhibition Night, all the 
buildings on the campus will be 
opdh to visitors. Students will be 
at work in the various shops, lab
oratories, and studios of the several 
'"fiifiileg'C!*;' The library school- at 
Carnegie Institute will also be 
open for inspection. No tickets' of 
admission arc required and a cor
dial invitation is extended to all.
President Baker will receive visi
tors in the Deans Office in Ad
ministration hall from 7:30 to 9:30 
p. m.
A dress parade will be given by 
the P. O. T. C. on the cut opposite 
the Morcwood avenue entrance. It 
will begin at 7:00 and will last for 
one-half hour. The Kiltie Band 
will play for the parade. Following 
this, the Kiltie Band will give a 
program in the outdoor theater. 
If the weather is not favorable, 
the Kiltie Band program will be 
held in the mens gymnasium.

' DR. DARWIN TO SPEAK 
IN UNION NEXT WEEK
Professor At Edinburgh to 
Lecture on Wave 
Mechanics
Three lecturers sponsored by the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
will address public audiences in five 
lectures next week on the Carnegie 
Tech campus. On. Monday and 
Tuesday evenings in the Union, Dr. 
C. G. Darwin, professor of Natural 
Philosophy at the University of 
Edinburgh, will speak on Wave 
Mechanics, a subject of interest 
to physicists. Prof. Darwin is a 
grandson of the eminent scientist, 
Charles Darwin, and a nephew of 
Mrs. Herbert DuPuy of Pittsburgh.
Of particular interest to Pitts
burghers will be the lectui*e on 
Wednesday evening by Mr. M. C. 
QBalcom, consulting engineer of New 
York City who^designed the steel 
work for the Cathedral of Learn
ing. Mr. Balcoin is well qualified 
to speak on this subject, Tlie 
Development of Modern City Build
ing, by virtue of the fact that he 
has served as consulting engineer 
on the Empire State Building, the 
City Bank-Farmcrs Trust Company 
Building, the new Waldorf-Astoria 
Hotel, and twenty-five buildings in 
the Grand Central group in New 
York City.
The third lecturer is Dr. John H. 
Williams, professor of Economics 
at Harvard University, who will 
appear on Thursday and Friday 
evenings. On Thursday evening lie 
will speak on "Federal Reserve 
Policy and on Friday evening his 
subject will be "Gold Movements 
and the Business Dcprcsisons. Dr. 
Willian\s was at one time economist 
of the American Bankers' Associa
tion, and formerly Westinghousc 
professor in Italy. He is the author 
of. Argentine International Trade 
under Paper, Balance of Interna
tional Payments of the United 
States, and America and World 
Finance.
All five lectures arc open to the 
public. They will begin at S:30 
oclock. The first three will be 
held in the Union, and the last two 
in Room 209, Engineering Hall.
Campus Queen Vote 
To Begin April 16
The first vote for Campus 
Queen will be held Thursday, 
April 16, 11:30.to 1:30, in the 
halls of all the schools. Only 
senior girls arc eligible for 
Queen. Fifteen arc chosen by the 
first ballot, the second ballot lim
its the number to three and the 
girl having the greatest number 
of votes in the final .balloting is 
elected Queen. The Cwens arc 
in charge of the affair and Ade
laide McClosky has been ap
pointed to take charge of the 
coronation.
Freshman Class 
To Give Dance 
In Union May 1
Organize Dating Bureau 
With Headquarters 
in Y Office
Tentative plans have been made 
for an all-freshman dancc to be 
held on May 1 from 9 to 12 oclock 
in the Union.
A novel feature of this dance is a 
Date Bureau at which all freshmen 
who wish to do so .may obtain 
dates. The purpose of the Bureau 
is to acquaint the members of the 
freshman class with each other. 
Instead of bringing a guest who 
does not attend Carnegie Tcch, a 
student may attend with a member 
of his own class.
An applicant for a date must 
fill out a blank stating his name, 
address, height, weight, color of hair, 
and color of eyes. The Bureau will 
then make the date, arranging all 
details.
Mary Husband, president of the 
freshman class in Margaret Mor
rison, is the chairman of the Date 
Bureau. Her committee will con
sist of the social chairman and 
three other representatives from 
each of the four schools.
The^ Bureau will have its head
quarters in the Y ^office in the 
industries Building. , Two or more 
members of the  committed will be 
here from 11:30 a. m.'tti' 1:30 p1. m. 
each school day from April 14 to 
May 1.
Dean Green has announced that 
out-of-town students may secure, 
accommodations for 50 cents in 
the dormitories if they make their 
reservations in advance.
The price of admission will be 
$1.50 per couple, although it is 
understood that each girl and boy 
who makes a date . through the 
Bureau will buy his own ticket.
C. Stoody Chosen To 
Compete For Rome 
Prize\_________
Clyde A. Stoody, a senior in the 
department of Architecture, -has 
been chosen as, one of- five to com
pete for the coveted Rome Prize 
in Architecture. This selection is 
the result of a preliminary competi
tion in which there were cightyciglit entrants from various parts of 
the country.
The placing of the entrant in the 
final competition for this prize puts 
Carnegie Tech in the enviable posi
tion of having a finalist in the two 
major architectural competitions 
which arc open to students in the 
United States, sincc D. R.: Jones, 
a graduate student, is entered in 
the finals for the Paris Prize which 
carries with it a .stipend of $4,000 
and a trip to Paris for advanced 
study. The Beaux Arts Institute 
of New York sponsors these com
petitions, in which Carnegie Tech 
is the onty institution to have an 
entrant for both prizes.
The subject for the preliminary 
competition was A  Reception 
Basin Treated as a War Memorial. 
Stoody is a member of the Delta 
Upsilon social fraternity and Scarab 
and Tau Sigma Delta honorary 
organizations.
Students Parents to Visit 
Here On Day of Exhibition
Several thousands of persons arc 
expected to visit Carnegie Tech on 
Parents Day, . which will be held 
this year on April 24, the same day 
as that of the exhibition. Six hun
dred and forty invitations have been 
sent out to the parents of freshmen, 
who will be special guests of the 
school.
The purpose of Parents Day is 
to give the fathers and mothers an 
opportunity to see Carnegie Tcch and 
become more familiar with the 
surroundings in which their sons and 
daughters are to spend four years. 
Formerly all parents were invited but 
bccausc of inability to take care of 
so large a number of visitors, the 
school is limiting its invitations this 
year to the parents of freshmen.
Freshmen should get in touch with 
their parents and arrange to meet 
them in the Exhibition Hall, College 
of Fine Arts, at . 3:30, on Parents 
'Day.
FRATERNITIES TO HOLD 
INTRA-MURAL TRACK 
MEET NEXT MONTH
To Have Athletic Council 
For Intra-Mural 
Athletics
At a meeting of the Interfratcrnity Council held recently, the 
Council decided to have the Intcrfratcrnity track meet in May. The 
date was decided after a recom
mendation by the interfraternity 
track committee, which was em
powered to write new rules for the 
meet and forward these to all the 
fraternities.
Mr. Roscnswcig was appointed 
to see the coaches of the various 
athlctic squads and discuss with 
them the feasibility of having one 
athletic council for all intra-mural 
athletics  during the school year, 
lie is to act in conjunction with 
the track committee so that an 
amendment to the constitution may 
be drawn up regarding the future 
policy on athletics.
 It Avas decidcd that the dormi
tories entering teams in the track 
meet be assessed two dollars as 
their share of deferring expenses 
in the meet..'
The Council is now at work try
ing to form an indoor baseball 
league. Mr. Bryant,was appointed 
to work on the plan, and if possi
ble to make arrangements for such 
a league.
There was considerable discus
sion of having an interfraternity 
migratory dancc this 3'ear, ( but 
in view of the fact that a migrator 
would cause undue hardship upon 
many fraternities, it was voted 
down at the meeting.
Engineering Faculty 
Awards Fellowships 
For Year 1931-32
Chosen Men Come From 
Seveh Different 
Universities

Seniors to Talk At 
A. I. E. E. Meeting
The Carnegie branch of the A. I.
E. E. will hold an important meet
ing on Wednesda3r, April 15, in 
room eleven, Machinery Hall at 
7:30 p. m. The election of offi
cers for next* year will be held, 
and two seniors will read papers 
on the branches of the electrical 
'field in which they are particularly 
interested.
Carl J. W. Long will give a 
paper oh Sound Pictures, and 
Thomas E. Zima will discuss 
Underground Cable. Both talks 
will include exhibitions. Mr. Loiig 
will illustrate his paper with motion 
pictures, while Mr. Zima will ex
hibit sections of underground cable.
Because of the election of officers 
for next 3rcar, Chairman Merle W. 
Smcdbcrg requests that as many 
as possible turn out for the meet
ing. The nominations arc as fol
lows: for chairman, Walter B.
Wigton, Elmer L. Jarrett, and 
Howard A. Wagner; for secretar3r, j 
Joseph F. Pock and Frank A. Lcnnberg; for treasurer, Stuart J. Myers 
and Samuel J. Hyle. A list of the j 
nominations has been posted in 
Machine^ Hall. Further nomina
tions ma3r be made up to the date 
of the meeting.
Engineering is commonly supposed 
to be based 011 natural science and 
upon mathematics. The abstract 
science of mathematics certainly is 
the same 011 both sides of the At
lantic, and natural 'science including, 
of course, physics and chcmist^, is 
quite the same everywhere, because 
steam is steam, iron is iron, copper 
is coppor, no matter where thc3r are, 
wholty independent of the location..
And yet those who have traveled 
and have 'had the opportune to 
study engineering - and engineers on 
both sides of the Atlantic find notice
able differences. Many features of 
engineering arc without doubt the 
same, but others arc so different'as 
to make the difference conspicuous.. 
Closer study of the differences proves 
that they arc due .to three conditions 
economic, climatic, and geographical.
The feature in our manufacturing 
methods at which foreign visitors to 
our shores marvel is mass production 
of standardized articles, whereas, in 
Europe small quantity production and 
extensive catering to the detailed 
wishes of the customer is the rule.
I11 mass j production such as we 
have in this country,- the designing 
engineer takes a rather subordinate 
position. After the machine or other 
equipment that is to be manufactured 
has been designed and tried out, and 
after the machinery for producing it 
in large quantities has been installed, 
the designing engineer drops from 
the picture. This docs not mean that 
engineers arc 110 longer needed from 
that time on. Quite on the contrary,
Committee Chooses 
Hotel Schenley For 
Senior Ball, May 1
The annual Senior Ball will be 
held in the Schcnlc3r Hotel on Fri
day, May 1, from 9 until 2 oclock. 
For the past three 3rcars this dance 
has been held at the Pittsburgh 
Country Club, but this year, in 
6rdcr to accommcdatc the large 
group, it will be- held in the ball 
room of the Hotel Schenley. The 
Senior Ball is held by the com
bined-senior classes of the f<?ur 
schools each 3'car during the spring 
term.
Several nationally popular or
chestras arc being considered; among 
these the b.est-known are Coon 
Saunders, Slecp3r Hall, Ray Iva3-- 
scr and Karl Kempt.
The committee is made up of 
representatives from the four col
leges- and includes Bill Br3rant, 
Sigmu Nu, chairman of the com
mittee and delegate from Engineer
ing; Ruth Licbcrman, a member of 
Mortar Board, delegate from Mar
garet Morrison; Dalilon Ritche3r, 
Kappa Sigma, delegate from the 
College of Fine Arts;1 and George 
Nease, Beta Theta Pi, represents 
Industries. The committee hopes 
to announce soon the orchestra and 
the filial plans for the Ball. The 
usual admission fee of $5 will' be 
charged..
Senior Booklets Go 
On Sale Tomorrow
The senior booklets which take 
the place of invitations for com
mencement Will be on sale in the 
front hall of the Administration 
building from 11:30 to 1:30 oclock 
011 April 15, 16 and 17. '
Imogcne Scliory is the chairman 
of the committee in charge of the 
booklets. She will be assisted by 
Mortar Board. These booklets ma3r' 
be obtained from the committee at 
any time.
The booklets will be of two 
kinds: one, of dark navy blue
leather, will cost fifty cents; the 
other, of white cardboard, Will cost 
twent3r-five cents. Each will con
tain the names and colleges of the 
graduating students, 'the commence
ment program, pictures of the class 
officers of the four colleges and a 
picture of each college. Both da}' 
and night school students are in

Phi Mu Alpha Holds 
Initiation And Election
On Sunday, March 29, Phi Mu 
Alpha held jts formal initiation in 
the Little Theater of the College 
of Fine Arts.
The following men were initiated, 
Ernst Stocker, Ted Estabrook, 
Wendell Jones, Jack Morris, Ra3rmond Metzger, and Frederick 
Schmidt. Dr. Karl A. Malchcrck 
was initiated as an honorar3r mem
ber.
Immediate^' following the initia
tion, a banquet was held at the 
Fairfax Apartment at which the 
following officers were elected: 
Ronald C. Taere, president; Leon 
Worle3r, vice president; Tom 
Young, secretar3 Ted Estabrook, 
treasurer; Roger Ingham, supreme 
councilman; Wendel W. Jones, 
warden; and Frederick W. Schmidt, 
historian.
thc\' are needed in conjunction with 
research operation, testing, and sales. 
In conscqucncc, we find in the United 
States a large number of engineers 
cmplo3cd in the sales offices and a 
comparatively small number in the 
designing offices, whereas, in most 
European countries it is the' other 
way round. It might be thought 
that the sales engineer docs not need 
a thorough technical training. Any 
such idea would be far from the 
truth for the following reasons: The 
designing engineer takes conditions as 
thc3' arc and designs a new machine, 
apparatus, structure, and the like, to 
fit into these conditions, whereas, 
the sales engineer looks at conditions 
as they arc and tries to fit into them 
that standard machine, apparatus, or 
structure- which fits best into the 
given conditions. In doing, so, he 
often modifies the existing conditions 
in order to make it possible to in
stall, or sell the standard equipment 
built b3r his company. Doing this 
work successfully requires not only 
sound judgment but also a good 
technical training.
Another great difference in engi
neering here and there has been 
brought about by the different wage 
rates. Wages in the United States 
are from two to five times as high 
as the3r arc in Europe .The. induce
ment is, therefore, very great with 
11s to save labor. On the other hand, 
fuel is rather dear in several Euro
pean countries, . and in those coun
tries the desire to save fuel is para(Continucd on Page Four)

SPORTS AND ALUMNI NEWS
A SURVEY recently conducted by the Athletic Association 
to determine how Carnegies athletes compare with the rest of 
the student body in class roorii work shows that tlie boys who 
double up in sports and studies certain- ~Tlv need no excuses to make for their / DCWSYO oy&tAwp 
scholastic standing. (Six varsity teams were considered \J^T -4YO :DI 
in the survey, and their averages were compared with those attained by the seventeen 
mens fraternities and the five mens dormitories.The representative athletic teams averaged better 
than cither the fraternities or the dormitories.Cross country, swimming, basketball, rifle, football, and 
boxing carried the banner for the athletes. Tennis and track 
were not considered because competition has not yet started in those sports. The six surveyed have been in competition at 
various times since the opening of the first semester.The fraternity average was 3.37, the dormitories attained 3.5, and the athletes 3.G3. To the varsity cross country team 
goes the honor of being the best collective group of student- athl'etes with a mark of 3.99. Close on the heels of the harriers 
came the swimmers with a 3.93 average.Figures on the entire group are:
Teams P. QsVarsity cross country .......-................................... 229.5Varsity swimming ...........................-................. 224.4
Varsity basketball ................................................* 200.23

Ratio 3.99 
3.93 3.73 
3.50 
3.34 3.28
The highest fraternity was Beta Sigma Rho, with 3.76. 
Two athletic teams surpassed that mark, and basketball was close to it. The highest dormitory was Boss Hall, with 3.69, 
a mark surpassed by three athletic teams. The lowest athletic outfit attained a better average than either the lowest fraternity 
or the lowest dormitory.The athletic department, through Clarence Ovcrend, Graduate Manager, has expressed keen pleasure in the showing of the athletes, and considers the cold figures sufficient proof that 
there is no dangerous over-emphasis on athletics at Carnegie.* * * * *
SEVERAL TRACK RECORDS seem almost certain to 
fall during the coming season if the practice performances of il; least three men are continued in competition. John Karcis, who is throwing the discus for the Plaid sincc spring grid 
practice has been abolished, is at present, heaving the discus farther than the school record of- 127 feet 3 inches set back 
in .1.923,Captain Ray Barger should boost, )iis. own pole vault record 
set last year if his steady improvement continues. In breaking !:he school record, Barger established a new high over a measure 
aMl feet <1: inches set back in 2:1.Coach Iialfcrty also believes Tom Coulter, Captain of last 
years Plcbe team, capable of breaking the hurdle records. Should Coulter set a new mark in the lows, lie will be breaking a record of twenty-two years standing set by Coach Iialfcrty 
himself.* * * H< ><
THE GENTLE ART of wrestling has sounded its knock 
at the door of Carnegies sport department, and the question of whether or not the mat game will appear on next years pro
gram is now under consideration. If enough interest is developed, and the material shows sufficient strength, the sport 
will in all probability be worked into a recognized activity. At present, Mr. Rintelin, an instructor in the chemistry department, is coaching about thirty candidates. To judge from the manly 
builds about the campus, wrestling will have an abundance of likely candidates, and to judge from the reception accorded 
boxing, it should win fans without any trouble.

PRACTICE MEET WITH 
P.A.A. SATURDAY TO 
OPEN TRACK SEASON
Completed Varsity Sched
ule Announced; Cincin
nati Newcomer
This Saturday Carnegies 1931 
varsity track team will make its 
first formal appearance when they 
take on the strong Pittsburgh Ath
letic Association squad in a practicc 
meet at the bowl. Pre-season 
meets with the P. A. A. have long 
been a means of testing Tartan 
track teams of the past and the 
meeting Saturday should furnish 
some basis on which to predict
the futlirc of what promises to bo 
one of the best teams in Carnegie 
history.
The Athlctic Club team is com
posed i mainly of former college 
stars and is one of the finest
amateur oUt'fitS in the country, 
.which fact alone-should bring out a 
good crowd for the opening meet.
The regular season gets under 
way on the following Saturday 
when Western Reserve sends- her
squad here for the first time, tho
only previous meet with the Red 
Cats having been held last year 
in Cleveland. The only other dual 
meet on the home schedule will 
be held the following Saturday 
when Cincinnati, a newcomer to 
the Skibo sohcdule, will furnish 
the competition.
The next Wednesday the Plaid 
squad .goes on the road meeting 
Geneva on her home track. Then 
after a short breathing spell the 
curtain is rung down with meets 
against Pitt and Grove City May. 
19 and 22, both meets being held 
on foreign tracks.
Tartan Marksmen 
Finish Fourth In 
Intercollegiates
To climax an already successful 
season, Carnegies crack riflemen 
annexed the district championship 
Saturday, and at the same time 
carried off fourth place in the Na
tional Intercollegiate Champion
ships. The Tartans scored a high 
1340, eleven points higher than any 
oilier- .team in the district. West 
Virginia took second honors with 
1329, followed closely by Cincinnati 
with 1328'. Penn College of ClcvcJand trailed with 1220.
Navy won the National Cham
pionship, scoring a phenomenal 
mark of 1382, while George Wash
ington took second by shooting a 
good 1370. Iowa State came in 
third with 1355. Pitt, shooting in 
the Navy district,1 garnered 1320 to 
place eighth.
Scherba, who was first among 
the Carnegie shots, rang up a 
strong 277, taking sixth place in 
the individual scoring. Wecbcr of 
Iowa State carried off first honors 
with a mark of 283.
This year the team enjoyed one 
of the most successful seasons in 
many years. They were always 
up among the leaders in the tele
graphic meets, and on three occa
sions finished first. They also won 
two out of their three shoulder-toshouldcr meets, losing only to. the 
Navy. Next year the prospects 
ar,e even better than they were this 
season, as there arc very few 
varsity men graduating. There are 
likewise many promising freshmen 
who will be available next year.
Red Cross Life Saving Class
Coach Riscdorpli will conduct in
struction classes for the Senior 
Red Cross Life Saving Test begin
ning Wednesday, April 15, at 5:10 
p. m. All interested should report 
in the pool at that time. Classes 
will be held Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday for the following two 
weeks. At the end of this time 
the regular test will be given for 
Senior Red Cross Life Saving.

Summoning 
a Ghost to your 
bidding
The chemist Van Helmontin 1609 discov
ered an invisible substance, an emanation 
from coal, that he named Cfgeist, meaning 
ghost, shortened in English to gas.
Only now do its miraculous possibilities 
begin to be glimpsed. Only now can mod
ern industry, like a latter-day Aladdin rub
bing his lamp to summon a vaporous genii, 
turn a valve and order this Ghost to any 
one of a hundred tasks.
From the beginning, the problem was one 
of piping. When Crane Co., a half century 
ago, set itself to develop and produce the 
right materials for every gas and oil purpose, 
it began an incalculably valuable contribu
tion to the solution of problems that had 
held back the gas industry since the Chinese 
used hollow bamboo.
So in the development of the natural and 
manufactured gas industry, as in practically 
every other industry, the Crane line of 
valves, fittings, fabricated piping, and 
specialties have played an important part. 
No matter what branch of industry you 
enter, you will find Crane materials playing 
a similarly important part.

Fortunately, the evening turned out 
to be a huge success bpcausc the 
toastmaster forgot to wake up from 
his usual Saturday afternoon nap 
and missed the party. J. M. (Jim

and the newer alumni brought the 
picture right up to the present date. 
The Clan wishes to acknowledge 
receipt of telegrams from the Pitts

Johnstown Clans. These telegrams 
were surely appreciated and they 
helped considerably in making the 
Spirit of the occasion more pro

little white celluloid sphere. However, 
New Yorkers have nothing on the

TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1931.THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
IdfelooglijsIfllefeitmm
Yes, I was fooled. I camc out for 
night classes on Thursday, April 2, 
sincp I read in the Tartan that 
Easter Vacations were cancelled. I 
am wondering how many more did 
the same. My friend the watchman 
with his Where to, young fellow 
greeted me on this evening and I 
sure did want to plug somebody, 
didnt matter who. Well thats what 
an Idle Student gets for not being 
on the job. I should have read about 
the cancellation of vacations on page 
two since that is where the story 
was printed. Next time I will make 
sure.
This sure is a real Scotch institu
tion, and I dont mean maybe. The 
other day I saw those wonderful yel
low horses put to other uses than 
just prohibiting those gas chariots, 
that is i you arc not privileged to 
drive in when you want to as I 
notice some do now and then, from 
driving through the quadrangle. And 
this is how they were utilized. There 
is a game played in which you Love 
510, sounds like the five, and ten 
cent store, but no, . I mean tennis. 
There were a couple of students 
playing this game over the yellow 
horses. Gee that was an idea. The 
horses acted as a net and the two 
players served the ball between them 
just like it was nobody's business. 
It was quite a combination tooall 
the colors of the Plaid were repre
sented-the yellow horsesa red ball, 
they couldnt have any other color, 
the green grass on the Quad and 
the heavenly blue sky, representing 
the Margaret Morrison College, the 
Arts College, the Industries' College 
and the Engineering College. After 
that? Im sure you will agree with 
me that it is a Scotch Institution.
Another sport being indulged in 
at the present time is that of roller 
skating. The young blood is cer
tainly careening about the Campus 
in great style. They arc, no doubt, 
{practicing for some tournament, and
NU SIGMA ALPHA 
FRATERNITY TO HOLD 
DANCE APRIL 18
Nu Sigma Alpha Honorary Fra
ternity is sponsoring a dance on 
Saturday evening, April 18, in the 
Union. The program will commence 
at 9 p. m. and will continue Until 12 
midnight.
The Town Tattlers Orchestra has 
been secured to furnish the music 
and very little more need be said 
about this group of musicians. They 
arc one of the outstanding groups 
of musicians which have been fur
nishing music for the night groups. 
This is the same orchestra which 
played at the annual dinner dance 
held by the fraternity December 27 
at Kuhns Rittenhousc Hotel.
During the evening a call will be 
made to several night students whom 
the organization wishes to honor at 
this time and these men will be 
pledged to the fraternity.
The dance will be an open dance, 
and all students on the campus arc 
welcome to attend the function. 
Assessment is $1 per couplc.
from the way they are going about 
it I am sure to bet on the winner. 
It must be nice to be able to go to 
day school when you can have all the 
fun in the evenings on your skates. 
The only skates I can manage to 
put on, well you know.
' By the time this will be read the 
Arts Ball will have come and gone, 
but not the memories of the day 
after the night before. We had a 
bullova of a time there, everybody, 
without exception, and there werent 
very many without. The committee in 
charge of this Ball certainly did ^ 
everything up in great style, except 
the Bull fight, and for this they 
should have called upon me, because 
when one of these is to be staged 
I am right there with the bolerio" 
or whatever you call those sticks the 
matadors use to persuade the bulls 
to bull. Anywa}', the setting was 
ideal, being held in the Arts, you 
couldnt be disappointed, and the 
only ones who missed anything were 
those who didnt attend. It sure was 
a huge success, and I am going to 
duplicate the occurrence on the next 
evening at the Post Arts Ball, maybe 
there will be something more to re
late.
INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
ASSOCIATION TO HOLD 
DANCE APRIL 17
The Industrial Arts Association of 
Pittsburgh and vicinity will hold a 
dance and card party on Friday eve
ning, April 17, in the Union. Fes
tivities will commence at 9 p. m. 
and continue until 12 midnight.
All students on the campus and 
friends arc welcomed to attend this 
dance and party and arc assured a 
very enjoyable evening. Many valu
able prizes will be awarded to the 
winners at cards. The assessment will 
be 75 cents per person.
Carl Ludwigs Orchestra has been 
sfecurcd, and this will insure a splen
did musical program for the danccrs.
INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
DINNER SCHEDULED 
FOR APRIL 25
- The Industrial Education group of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
will hold its annual dinner on Satur
day evening, April 25, in the Car
negie Inn Dining room.
Preliminary plans arc now being 
made for the affair and complete in
formation will be available by next 
week.
This group is a unique one as it 
comprises both 'the night students and 
the day students in one course and 
permits of a very .diversified schedule.
All students who arc registered in 
the course, night or day, will be 
sent invitations to the function, and 
they arc urged to send in their 
reservations promptly in order that 
a place be reserved for them.
NIGHT COLLEGE OF FINE 
ARTS TO HOLD FINAL 
DANCE APRIL 25
The last social function of the 
Night College of Fine Arts will be 
held on April 25 in the'Union. The

Timken will help to 
solve your future 
bearing problems
When your college days are over 
and you take your place in industry, 
bearings will be one of your biggest 
problems, whether you are concerned 
with the designing or selection of 
machinery.
Then you will find a thorough 
knowledge of the construction and 
application of Timken Tapered 
Roller Bearings one of your most 
valuable assets.
In order to appreciate how widespread 
and how profound the influence of 
Timken Bearings is throughout all 
industry, it is 
only necessary 
to consider that 
there is hardly 
any type of mod
ern machinery
in which Timkens are not used. Th 
reason is found in the ability of 
Timken Bearings not only to reduce 
frittion to the  vanishing point, but 
to carry radial loads, thrust loads or 
both together in any combination at 
the same time.
Timken Bearings also hold shafts in 
alignment, and keep gears meshing 
smoothly and quietly.
Their use is both a protection and 
an economy, for it is an established 
fact that Timken-equipped machin
ery costs less to operate and main
tain and gives 
many extra 
years of service.

Suddenly the industrial leader awakes to take stock of 
his plant. He finds that, under his very nose, it has grown 
antiquated. New daysnew ways. Each new machine 
rings the death knell of old ones now in use. And the 
steady stream of new and better tools often takes indus
try by surprise.
American Machinist has taken it upon itself to stave off 
this day of reckoning in our metal-working plants. It has 
appointed itself an advance guard of modern industry;;; 
scouting for the new :;; bringing word of it to the lead
ers of industry... pointing out to them the wrinkles and 
signs of age on our industrial brow.
It doesnt wait for them to take stock of themselves. 
Every five years American Machinist takes stock for them; 
And it brings them the cold facts through an exhaustive 
and rigid nation-wide survey. In 1925, it pointed out 
that 44% of all machine-tool equipment was obsolete. In 
1930, its census set that figure at 48%. It placed that 
data before responsible men. And it showed them how 
to bring their plants up to date.
There is probably a McGraw-Hill paper covering the in
dustry you intend to enter. Get the jump on your first job' 
by keeping abreast of what its leaders are thinking and 
doing now. Most college libraries have McGraw-Hill 
Publications on file.

WASHING COAL
The new coal washing plant of 
the Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Cor
poration, at Covcrdalc, was recent
ly inspected by a large group of 
executives from various coal com
panies operating in and around 
Pittsburgh. The plant is credited 
with having the capacity to clean 
forty-five hundred tons of coal in 
an eight hour working day, and 
employs the Chase flotation pro
cess developed by Major Chase of 
Philadelphia.
The plant is expected to go into 
full operation at once, and is ex
pected to keep the one thousand 
men employed at Covcrdalc steadi
ly at work. The installation is 
commendable from this point of 
view, and, it is hoped, will fully 
come up to specifications in this 
respect.
The new plant is only one of 
the many projects utfder way at 
present, started by various com
panies, that will help to relieve to 
a great extent, the unemployment 
situation here.

Petty Thieves
Several cases of theft from the plebes locker room in the 
lower corridor of Industries have been reported in the last two weeks. This is a regrettable condition and one which should 
not exist at Carnegie.The lockers are of the absolute wire mesh type and their 
make-up is conducive to stealing for anyone who has that inclination. Perhaps the thieves are not students, but rather 
loiterers who frequent the campus on various occasions. The 
location of the locker room is such that it is easily accessible to outsiders without their having to traverse much of the 
campus. It might be well for those in charge to install the 
new type of locker with the regulation combination lock and thus insure the safety of valuables stored in the lockers.
Spirit
Last Friday night one of Carnegies long forgotten tradi
tions, the Arts Ball, was revived. The revival was interesting, 
not only because it provided a good time, but because the spirit of friendship and co-operation necessary for its success will aid 
laterially in developing another campus necessityschool spirit.The proper school spirit has been lacking the past several 
'ears particularly in the colleges of Engineering and Industries. ,Vith crowded schedules and the long hours necessary for outide preparation it is probably difficult to find time for extra- rurricular activities, but surely some could find the time, per
haps even the ambition, /to put to them. The student activities 
are in need of new and ambitious talent, and there are a number of openings for those who are willing to work.

Howdy, Yo All!
Hoping the Easter vacation has 
made you forget somewhat that last 
monstrosity called "The .Tartan,' we 
greet you. We feel sorry for anyone 
who believed anything in that last 
issue. It was just a nightmare of a 
feeble-minded staff. However, all 
night-marcs arc interesting, for 
awhile. It was somewhat likp the last 
Puppet in that respect. Eddie Ashe 
and his lackeys finished up a success
ful regime by poking .fun at this 
feeble-minded staff. It seemed sort 
of cowardly to do so in their last 
official act, but we suppose we cant 
protest if there is so much of a 
field for fun-poking. Boy! Can we 
take 'em! We must say, {hough, that 
the Puppets werent as bad as usual 
this year. Youre welcome, Eddie!
The new staff, with Harvey Col
lins in the' role of figure-head, puts 
out an issue soon. There will be no 
more Greek feossips in this direction, 
because Bill Conway will be responsi
ble for said column, and Bill knows 
better. Paul Wiles strange actions 
as Greek Gossipcr could be explained 
by the fact that lies just another 
Commercial Engineer, like Frank 
Foote, the Fender Bender.
From zvhal the Printers and Engi
neers I ell us, the Arts Ball Friday 
night ivas one of those things. The 
return of an honored tradition )o the 
campus ivas welcomed with open 
arms. The flood-gates of jollity were 
loosed and the only ones who didnt 
have a good time were the Engineers 
zuho could have gone and didnt. No 
one was dressed as a hot tamale, al
though some of the costumcs were 
pretty warm. All in attendance were 
Arts students except Steiner, Magnuson, Cooke, Boylt, Estabrooke, Cad
mus, Simpson, Peg Shaffer, Gillilan, 
and some others. For the first Arts 
Ball in history Dean Greene didnt 
have to reprimand anyone for unbe
coming conduct. The hangover called 
the Post Arts Ball lackcd much of 
the color of the original article, be
cause sixteen barrels of torn decora
tions, paper napkins, pieces of cos
tum c, and bric-a-brac were carried 
out of Arts School Saturday morn
ing. There were no costumes at the 
Saturday . night dance, either, al
though Jim Baushkc, Chuck Miller, 
Jimmy Leonard and Jim Corrigan 
wire disguised pretty well.
The first ballot for the 1931 Cam
pus queen will be taken Thursday 
next. Three dollars * to a doughnut 
says the next Queen of-the Campus 
will be a Maggie Murph. It is like
ly that the first three will be from 
the same school. Dont feel bad, 
though, Arts School, because its 
merely a coincidence. Maybe its be
cause there arc too many queens in 
Arts School. Adelaide McCloskey is 
Chairman of the Coronation commit
tee and is taking precautions that the 
boys dont vote two  or three times 
in different schools, as in the past. 
This will be the first election in 
Pittsburgh in years that is on the 
level. We want Adelaide McCloskey 
for Mayor!
Last week produced conclusive 
evidence that Spring is all-around us 
at last. When the Architects begin to 
loaf on the lawn across from the 
tennis courts, when Harry Kolb 
roller-skates in female company up 
and down Woodlawn, when the 
athletes strut their newly-won sweat
ers, when the trad:, men chase each 
other around the Bowl, when the 
hired help begin to scrape the ten
nis courts, Sprigg had cub. When 
the co-eds discard their coats and 
then worry all day about the tricky 
winds, Spring is here. When all the 
boys come coatless and hatlcss to 
class of a Friday morning, and swim 
home through a down-pour on Fri
day evening, it must be Spring!

Little Girls
The Public Nuisance was so as
sailed by his gentlemen friends with 
threats of dire bodily violence after 
his publication last month of What 
little Girls think about little Boys, 
that lie had to promise to continue 
the forum another issue and give 
the males a chance to rebut.
In the first place, they (the little 
boys) say they dont think, half 
so much about the girls as the girls 
do ab.out them. Girls, they para
phrase Mr. Byron, think of nothing 
except boys. To men, however, 
women are just another thing, 
since males possess many interests,
Howsoever, the boys admit that 
girls arc a biological necessity, 
pleasant' enough on occasion. But 
leaving sex strictly out -of this 
discussion, girls are total flops. 
Girls are hypocrits, they are crook.cd, they arc insincere, they are 
fakes, they are prodigal liars, they 
arp cats, they arc supremely selfish, 
they perpetually pretend. These 
are harsh statements and the .Public 
Nuisance asked for proof.
Well, it appears that one gentle
man observer caught three young 
ladies off guard. . He happened to 
be spying on them when they were 
ignorant of the presence of any 
men. They were happy, carefree, 
natural. Hola! as the Puppet would 
have me say. A man entered the 
place. The three maidens straight
away changed their characters, ac
quired a dozen quick feminine man
nerisms, and became as totally un
natural as a synthetic fur coat.
Criticism Number Two. Girls 
look at all men as potential hus
bands; a mans got to be on his 
guard every minute of the day and 
every second of the night, else 
some sly vixen is liable to put . a 
noose about his neck and drag him 
into the holy bonds of matrimony. 
The entire life of a woman de
pends- upon the perfection of the 
snaring technique. Peggy Hopkins 
Joyce, were it not for a factor or 
two, would be the feminine ideal.
Criticism Number Three. Girls 
really arent interested in the things 
that men are. They pretend to be, 
they shout at football games, they 
manifest an interest in politics, 
they play tennis, they talk .about 
finance and big businessbut they 
really dont care. Its all part of 
the trapping device.
Women are liars, theyre poor 
sports, they wont bac each other 
up ifi anything personal is at stake. 
Take two of the best girl friends 
in the world, stick in a man that 
theyre both interested in, and ask
proaches to a good place to dine 
and dance . . . All the Cwens vacated

Girl One about Girl Two, and 
youll find that her feet are cold 
and that she gets letters from a 
traveling salesman in South Bend 
every other day. Boys interested 
in the same women will metaphor
ically strip her, lay her on the dis
secting table, and correlate their 
investigatory procedures. But let 
the girl ask Boy One about Boy 
Two, and all she'll learn is that lie 
is "a great guy, and not a whisper 
concerning .the temperature of his 
feet or the femme he picked up at 
Wool worths.
Girls lack critical judgment. If 
they like you, everything you do 
or say is fine and wonderful. If 
you keep quiet, you are "deep; if 
you jabber, you are clever. But if 
they dont like you, no matter 
how good you really are, they 
wont admit it and will run you 
down at every opportunity..
Girls possess no reason. They 
perform insane deeds with no possi
ble rationale. They live by in
stinct and intuition, and all too 
often these are wrong. In con
clusion, the only thing you can 
be sure about a woman is that you 
are never sure what shes going 
to do or say, and often you aren't 
even certain o^ that!
Well, thats enough.

Engineering Here And Abroad

mount and overshadows everything 
else, v In consequence, Europe excels 
in fuel-saving equipment, and the 
United States in labor-saving equip
ment.
Our high wages in conjunction with 
labor-saving equipment have brought 
about a large output of work per 
man. In consequence, the worker, with 
his high wages has purchasing power 
and can afford to buy the many 
articles which arc produced by high
ly paid labor operating very efficient
ly complicated higli-production ma
chinery. This situation brings us right 
back to mass production. High wage 
rates have compelled.engineers in the 
United States to design, labor-saving 
machinery and to standardizethat is 
to say, to make  as. few different 
sizes and grades of .any ;onc' kind of 
equipment as possible. Labor-saving 
machinery and- standardization have 
made possible our mass production, 
and mass production- finds a ready 
market on account' of a high wage 
rate. Mass production and standard
ization have bceiv sneered at by cul
tured. Europeans as depressing .the 
level of spiritual culture arid'- placing 
too much emphasis on material things. 
Nevertheless, the European nations 
envy our mass-proditction prosperity 
and arc endeavoring to imitate it, as 
far as Europoan conditions permit.
Not every article of use or every, 
machine, however, can be made by 
mass-production methods. I might re
fer to rolling mills, large-hydraulic 
turbines, large steam turbines, large 
high pressure boilers, and similar
equipment which  cannot be sold 
across the countcr and which must 
be more or less specially designed in 
each case. In the building of that
equipment the designing engineer 
comes into his own here the same 
as he does in Europe. Only a very 
small number of engineers among, the 
total number of engineers in the
country, however, is required for this
specialized design work.- American in
stitutions of technology and universi

deeply into the teaching of highly 
specialized subjects. I tv Europe, and 
particularly ip Germany and Sweden, 
a great deal of this work is taught 
in technical universities, because the 
student who enters a technical uni
versity is as far along as the sopho
more is m the United States after 
lie has been in college about a year 
and a quarter. Since many technical 
courses, in Germany for instance, 
take four and pne-half years for 
their completion, and since the vaca
tions arc shorter than they arc in 
the United States, the European stu
dent has approximately two years 
more of intensified- specialized 'tech
nical training than our students. This 
situation is probably the principal 
reason. why specialists for this type 
of .design work arc very frequently, 
imported from abroad. Our drafting 
rooms and engineering officcs are- full 
of men . who have immigrated, from 
abroad .and who furnish the special-: 
ized knowledge for advanced, design 
in the detail field; add to that the 
facts that European .engineers arc 
willing to work for comparatively 
low salaries and that our technical 
graduates have a great dislike for the 
drafting room.
Of course, that situation, will some 
day be changed, because immigration 
will be restricted, arid .because the 
slogan, "America for the Americans, 
will arise. When that time arrives, it 
will become necessary tq give highly 
specialized tcchhical . instruction here 
in the United States,; but we arc 
too , practical a people to do that 
teaching as it is done in Europe. We 
revolt at the thought of making each 
year 100,000 technical students learn 
that which less than one per cent of 
them ' can use. Highly specialized 
technical instruction must be given 
after graduation, at a time when the 
student knows exactly what he wants 
and needs. It must be taught partly

by correspondence and partly in 
residence by a few selected schools 
who draw students from the whole 
country. The sncccssful carrying out 
of this comprehensive scheme re
quires the co-operation  of practically 
all the engineering schools and col
leges, for without that co-operation 
the plan cannot mature.
As previously stated, the necessity 
for highly specialized technical in
struction 'is not vet upon us, but in 
ten or fifteen years conditions will 
be different, and it is hoped that a 
conccrtcd start for specialized post
graduate instruction will have been 
made.
In the meantime, our students re
ceive a broad, fundamental technical 
training, upon which specialized tech
nical training can be built at any 
time.
(Professor Trinks is admirably 
qualified to contrast engineering at 
home with the same profession on the 
Continent, for lie has had opportun
ity to* experience the prevailing con
ditions -from  both viewpoints. Edu
cated at the University of Charlottcnburg in his native country and later 
associated with the famous Krupps, 
he has learned the' American side, of 
the engineering . situation through 
training many young men for that 
calling. Professor Trinks, one of 
the pioneers of the engineering 
faculty at Carnegie, is head of his 
Department, and it - is to such men 
that Carnegie owes its enviable 
reputation as a technical School.)
