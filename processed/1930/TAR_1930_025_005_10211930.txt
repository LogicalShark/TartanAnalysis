STUBBORN SCOTCH RESISTANCE YIELDS TO BRILLIANT ATTACK 
OF ROCKNES FIGHTING IRISH
Eyth Scores Lone Touch 
down As Hopes "For the 
Title Are Dimmed
IRISH UNDERESTIMATED
Plaid Injuries Force First 
Stringers Out of Action 
Early in Contest
Carnegies bid for an undefeated 
. season and the 1930 National Cham
pionship, were severely and seriously 
jolted last Saturday when the Skibos, 
untrue to their' form, were defeated 
by a powerful Gold and Blue team, 
one of the best that the South Bend 
school has ever * put on the field; 
Rocknc, who up to the opening 
minute of the game was pessimistic 
as to the outcome, sent a team 
against the Plaid which was very 
much better than the Scotch anti
cipated, and when the final gun 
barked, and the count was made, it 
wasfound that the Irish had-run up 
an -amazing score ,of 21-6 in exactly 
one hour of playing.
Comes As Surprise 
It was a cruel blow, that game 
on Saturda}'. Everything seemed to 
go wrong. The first quarter was 
one of interest to the Scotch fans, 
but the tide turned in the next 
period, and the unexpected happened. 
The Carnegie line failed to hold up 
it was expected to do, but it is diffi
cult to say whether this was due to 
its own failings or to the outstand
ing playing of the Irish.
Two of Notre. Dames, touchdowns 
camc through forward passes which 
sifted through Carnegies secondar}' 
defense into the waiting arms of 
the Irish. The other came when a 
bad pas? from center caused Car
negie to fumble op their own 4 
yard line and Notre Dame recovered 
.and put the ball ciyer on the first 
play. Eyth saved the SWbo hopes 
early in the second half when he 
charged through left tackle, Reversed 
bis field through. the secondary de
fense, and ran 72 yards for the only 
Plaid ' touchdown.
Notre Dame-Stars 
Notre Dame really, did not have 
any individual starsevery man oh 
their whole team played like 
veteranhut if outstanding sizars are 
to be picked, Schwartz, Savoldi, and 
Caridco would carry the lead. These 
three boys really played a wonderful 
game and deserve every bit of credit 
that is given to them. It i3 due to 
the former that the Irish scored' 
two of their touchdowns, and his 
passes were the spectacle of the day 
Carideo, the boy with the wonder toe, 
sent three straight balls between the 
posts, one after each touchdown, 
while Savoldi hit the line time after 
time for consistent- gains.
However, the Plaid was not with' 
out stars even though they were de
feated, and were not able to gel 
started. "Little Dutch, who made 
the only touchdown, played a real 
. game of ball, and did a lot of gain
ing in both line plunging and end

SCHOLARSHIP HIGH
An article, the Development of 
the Welding Department at Car
negie Institute of Technology 
by Prof. Samuel E. Dibble, is in
cluded in the current issue 
| Welding, a monthly publication 
dealing with the welding industry.
In his article, Mr. Dibble traces 
the development of welding at Car
negie from 1916, when the first 
classes were held, to the present 
time. In 1916, lie said, t'w 
oxy-acctylcnc torches were made 
available, as compared with til 22 gas and 12 arc-welding stations 
now a part of Hie equipment.
He also discussed the work done 
during the. Wg'rld war by group: 
of soldiers.
Varied Classes Scheduled
In discussing the various classes 
receiving instruction, Mr, Dibble 
said: The department today ha
a varied roup of classes. Th 
large groups in the day classes 
are composed of freshmen taking 
engineering courses. * In addition, 
we have the 3roung men'who arc 
studj'ing automobile maintenance, 
aviation, steam. fitting, sheet metal 
trades, and. building construction 
Eadi group requires special train 
ing along its particular line inso
far as welding is-concerned. Eve
ning classes arc continuous from 
6:30 to 8:30, and from 8:30 to 
10:30, five night a week.
"Saturday mornings arc sched
uled for the members of the Local 
Union of Stcamfittcrs. These men 
come in groups of 60 at a time 
for a period of 20 weeks, and the 
elements of welding pipe arc prcsented to them. Saturday after
noons arc reserved for a.group of 
aviation mechanics who arc study-- 
ing welding from the standpoint 
of the airplane. This makes very 
interesting groups . of . young men 
with varied purposes for studying 
welding.  A total number of ap
proximately 600 students are taught 
welding each week. At registration 
last fall for the evening classes 
in - welding, only Jabout 130 men1 
could be accommodated each week, 
and at the end of registration there 
was a waiting list of about 150. 
Future Development Seen
With regard to the future de
velopment  in the department Mr. 
Dibble continued: "The.''next dc;
vclopmcnt in the welding depart
ment will be that of starting ar 
advance coursc. This course will 
consist of three groups of studies: 
First, a course of lectures on the 
structure of >metals; second, mak
ing of sample welds, using various 
types of material, filler rods, and 
electrodes; third, testing these 
sample welds for strength, com
paring with the parent metals.

LECTURE BY DELL 
AT Y. M. & Y. W. C. A.
Floyd Dell, noted author and 
playwright, will speak on Love 
in the Machine Age, on Tuesday, 
October 28, at 2:15, in the audi-. 
torium of the Y. M. and W. H. A. 
Bellefiield and Fifth aveni\es.
"Mooncalf,' which was suppress
ed, as most of his books have 
been, is one of^ Mr. Dells best 
known works. Mr. Dell, a true 
bohemian in character, has a typi
cal Greenwich villagers, attitude 
toward' life. Most of his subject 
matter deals with people and cus
toms of Greenwich village.
Mr. Dell, one of the important 
modern dramatic contemporaries, 
started a literary revolution a few 
years ago. As a result, every au
thor gained the privilege of writ
ing on any subject he desired with
out serious condemnation on the 
part of the critics or the public.
This- meeting will be open to 
the' public. A very cordial invi
tation is extended to all who are 
interested in the best in modern 
iiterature and modern psychology, 
in both of which fields Mr. Dell 
has distinguished himself.
The Look Before You Leap 
slogan bids fair to be continued 
long after the annual Safety Week 
has passed, though in a different 
field of activity. Some enterprising 
soul with the maternal Dorothy 
Dix attitude, and with all the sym
pathy in the world for -advice-less 
boys, has ingeniously devised a set 
of questions relating to' the -future 
wrifc.
The young man hesitating about 
the choice of a permanent .girl 
friend, or wishing to check on the 
merits of the otic he already has, 
will find ample room for thought 
here. All the admirable qualities 
with which blind love so gcu:rously 
cndow,s the One and Only arc 
mercilessly quartered, dissected, and 
classified into ten major classes, 
each of which has ten questions 
relating to it. Scorc ten for cach 
point if she is perfectand if her 
total score be 950 or over, seize 
her while }-ou may, young man, 
for shes, of this description arc 
rarely found, and it is jrour boundcn 
Duty to take advantage of Oppor
tunity before somebody else beats 
you to it!
Looks, he says, is . the first 
quality of merit, and it may be 
found by several niorc methods 
than the cyc-cm-up-n-down one. 
How does she look in a bathing 
suit? Arc her stocking scams al
ways straight? Does she wear 
suitable clothes, or docs she bcdock 
hcrsclf in an evening gown for a 
football game? How well can she 
dress on a limited income? And, 
are you proud to introduce her to 
your friends?
Health is the second item, and 
if your Susie doesnt have a clear 
complexion, hankers after bad 
liquor or the weed, isnt fond of 
exercise,, or doesnt have lots .>f 
pepthen, look tthat rascal Cupid
square in the eye and tell him to 
goelsewhere.
That niuch-talked-of, elusive qual
ityCharmmay easily be cata
logued. How consistent arc her 
manners, how good her sense of 
humor, how controllable her tem
per, and how intelligently can she 
talk on subjects which arc of in 
tcrcst to you and others, but which 
arc not necessarily of interest to 
lfcr? These arc but a few of the 
ways in which to determine if she 
is an IT girl or not. Disposi
tion, we think, might well have 
been included under the category 
just.outlined, but it is given fourth 
placc here. How free is she from 
jealousy? Ts she a spoiled child? 
If she Is wrong how often doc: 
she admit it? How well contented 
is she with what she has and can 
afford?, How lightly docs She take 
her troubles?
We all like a good sport, and it 
is the possessionor lack of itthat breaks up many homes. Test 
her with these: How free is she 
from bearing long grudges? Mow 
willing to try new methods of do
ing things? Will she enjoy a show 
if she has to sit in the second bal
cony? (Wc ask you, would any 
;bpdy?) How far can you trust her 
to keep a secret or promise? How 
willingly docs she keep an engage
ment at home with you if a chance 
to go out with someone else comes 
along?
In this modern arc ,of Effici
ency, this quality is much sought 
after. The housewife has turned 
domestic economist, and with her 
evolution has come new standards. 
How capablc is she of getting work 
done on scheduled time?. Docs she 
put off things until tomorrow? Is 
her wardrobe kept in readiness for 
any occasion? Can she conccn(Contintied on Page Four)

Maggie Murphs Remain After School For
Football Practice and Study of Tactics
Maggie Murphs, it is said, are 
simply killing themselves with work 
this year, according to observers. 
They report promptly at 8:30, and 
dont leave the building until 4:30 
or later every day.
Wellif were not going the manchewdog story one betterMaggie 
Murphs work!
It is truetheyre doing research. 
Profound* study is being expended 
by Social Workers, Secretaries, and 
Scientists upon the form and 
methods'of playing football, as well 
upon curly heads. The students 
peer through M.M.C.Q windows, 
while the instructors gallop in- the 
Bowl. And don't think its all 
plcbes alookingsome seven seniors 
spend whole days doing nothing else. 
For that matter, certain otherwise 
staid and intelligent faculty mem
bers often pause and gaze calculatingly at the usual fifty beautiful but 
brainless (please take one grain 
NaCI) specimens of humanity below.
The idea of practice football as 
differentiated from Stadium football, 
according to those talcing the coursc, 
is to boot the ball in as aloof a 
manner as possiblethe 'other fel
low being permitted to catch the ball 
if he cares to. He may then let 
it slide through his fingers and 
come to a gentle stop upon the 
greenswardji In. this maneuver re
taining the ball between ones hands
for more than 5 seconds upon catch
ing is not approved, nor is giving 
the ball a healthy kick considered
ethical.
Comfort is essential for good prac
tise psychology. The wearing of 
track suits is not condemned, and 
the use . of belts or suspenders is 
strictly prohibited. Curtains have
been hung and electric lights wired 
in to make the boys feel more at 
home. Red velour camp stools and 
a piano have been ordered and arc 
expected to arrive in about two
weeks. The management regrets not 
being able to afford book cases.
Among the minor procedures at 
practice is the trick of projecting 
into the ball with hue's foot a high 
parabolic direction; then collecting
the dust raised by the ball when it 
hits, and calculating the kinetic 
energy of the man kicking, from 
which data is determined his ability 
as a toucbdoWncr. One of the most 
important exercises is the counting 
formation. One man counts, usually 
getting stuck at about five, while the 
rest of the squad plays a puzzling 
mixture of "Going to Jerusalem and 
Tlidc-and-Go-Scek, the object be
ing to keep the ball in a state of 
bewilderment.
If the red jerseys face N.Y.U. 
with their usual practice bag of 
tricks, who can say whats what 
unless it be the M.Ms?
Pablo Picasso's painting, "Portrait 
of Mine. Picasso, won the first 
prize of $1,500 at1 the International 
Exhibition of Modern Painting, which 
opened Thursday, Octobef- 16, at 
the Carnegie Art Museum.
Although Picasso was born in 
Malaga, Spain, he is classed as a 
'French .artist, probably because lie 
has lived and worked in Paris since 
l^j was twenty years old. He began 
his . training under his father, learn
ing art with astounding rapidity. 
About 1907, Picasso, in conjunction 
with Braque, developed the form of 
art that bccamc known as Cubism. 
This abstract painting continued for 
ten years, at the end of which period 
lie reverted to classicism.
Accomplished Artist
At one moment lie is the 
most perfect of academic drafts
men ; at another the most savage 
and violent of abstract innovator-:. 
His energy is colossal, i^ot only in 
the field of painting, but also in jtlie 
graphic arts, as a sculptor, and as 
a stage director. Picasso is one of 
the great figures in European Art.
Of the fifteen nations represented 
in the exhibition, practically all the 
prizes were won by artists from the 
United States and France. There 
were six awards made to American 
artists, two to French artists, and 
one to an Italian. Alexander Brook 
who was awarded second prize, .and 
the Lehman prize; Henry Lee 
Fec, first honorable mention ; Mauiice 
Sjcrne and Niles Spencer, honorable 
mention, are the Americans. ^Picasso 
and Charles' Dufrcsne, who won the. 
third prize, arc French. The other 
honorable mention was awarded to 
Giuseppe Montanari, an Italian.
American Artist Second
The second prize and also the 
Lehman prize, each worth $1,000 and 
$2,000 respectively, were awarded to 
Alexander Brook. The painting which 
won him these prizes is called 
Interior." Mr. Brook is one of 
the most interesting of the younger 
American artists. He believes Hint 
the artist in America today is 
fortunate in that it is not imperative 
for him to go abroad either to 
study art or to see good pictures. 
'He holds that American artists 
should become interested in their own 
surroundings and in their own par
ticular brand of civilization. His 
work is representative of the newer 
quality in American art. It admit,i 
our debt to French influences, but 
at the same time establishes itself 
as a personal and native statement 
of the newer trends in our painting.
"Still Life, a painting by Charles 
Dufrcsne, won the Third Prize of 
$500. This artist is represented in 
the Luxembourg, and in many other 
museums and private collections in 
France. Dufrcsne pays little atten
tion to construction and balance.

3?AGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1930.

ALUMNI NEWS
AN UNDERESTIMATED IRISH TROUPE surprised the 
football world, including themielves, at South Bend, Saturday. 
Practically every coach and sports writer conceded Carnegie an 
edge of at least six pointsuntil after the first' few minutes, of 
play when the polished Rockne machine proved that they were 
capable of .managing the unexpected. Even Coach Rockne 
showed, his respect for the Tartans, by starting his first-stringers, 
which is a tribute to any team.
The Plaids certainly were not at their best, and to make 
things worse, injuries farced substitutions in the lineup while 
thc contest was still young. Notre Dame, on the other hand, 
appeared to be in their prime and went about things in a 
calm way.
^ * * * * *
ALEX DUNCANIS WAS PUT ON THE 
\ SHELF with leg injuries early in the game, 
i Duke has been playing stellar ball all season 
any way you take it, but has received little 
I credit. The pivot position is one of the most 
exacting on the line, both offensively and dcI fcnsively, yet seldom does a spectator watch 
\ what goes on there. Dukes record for accur, ate passing from center is hard to beat and 
; it is nothing short of a compliment when we 
j say that lie made but one bad pass all last  year. I
S * * * * >K
WITH A SMALL PART of the-pre-season training period 
behind them, the Plaid swimmers are none the worse and con
tinue their work despite the drop in temperature. The initial 
call netted a squad of 59 plus one humble Plebe aspirant for 
the managerial position. Additional fcandidates should report at 
once to Coach Risedorph in the gym. lie is also on the market 
for more freshmen managers.
This week tlie more prominent part of the Carnegie water 
works will plunge into the water for the official wetting of the 
year. Both Varsity and Plebe squads arc well balanced and 
;i program of hard work in the. water should produce fairly 
good teams by the time the season rolls around. The group of 
first year mcrbabes looks better than last years squad providing 
none of them get lost in the ripples of the pool.

runs to hold up the fame that he 
has already received. "Pete" Flana
gan, who has been playing good 
ball this year, held down his wing 
position, without a flaw. Besides play
ing a nicc defensive game, Pete 
showed some pretty field work, 'ind 
a number o times took the ball for 
some goodly gains.
Game Not Brilliant 
The contest did .not produce the 
brilliancy that was previously ex
pected. Notre Dame played steady, 
hard football, while Carnegie was 
erratic, its line loose and its secon
dary defense lax on breaking up 
passes and meeting the Irish backs.
It,, was bitter cold and the crowd 
of 40,000 were frozen by the time 
the. game was over.
This game, however, does not spell 
a bad season for Carnegie. There 
arc some big games just coming on 
and these will probably be more ex
citing than the one with the Irish. 
Carnegie had a bad day last, Satur
day, and something was definitely 
wrong. IE the team had played as 
they did two weeks ago, it is lilg)i|y, 
probable, that the result last week 
would have, been very much different. 
Notre Dame was at the crest if the 
wave, and who knows but that they 
may fall in the wake in a short
time, thus depriving them of what 
we were so anxious to grasp.
WcHtcrn Rciicrve Next 
Next week; the team will travel to 
Cleveland to battle with Gordon 
Locke's Western Reserve outfit. Judg
ing by the size of our Schenley
Park rivals score we should not
have very much trouble, and the 
second string men will probable see 
a lot of the game while the first 
team rests up for the big battle
the coming week.

coal so that he can utilize it to 
the best advantage. The results of 
experiments in coal research, lie 
predicts, will bring the industries 
related to coal close to the mine, 
and those .regions where soft coal 
is found will enjoy an increasing 
industrial activity in the future.
The present abundance of oil 
and gas has retarded coal research, 
but when the supply of petroleum 
begins to fail, coal will again be
come an important factor in in
dustrial development. The foreign 
countries without the abundance 
of the raw product have gone far 
in finding new use? for coal, and 
new methods of treating it:. The 
necessity for a cheap supply of 
motor fuel in the future may 
lead to the conversion of coal into 
a synthetic petrolcuip in this conn-, 
try.
In explaining the organization of 
the coal research laboratory at 
Carnegie Dr. Baker cited the fact 
that coal touches almost: every 
phase of modern life. It: will prob
ably always be our source of power 
and our cheapest. The field of fuel 
technology presents infinite pos
sibilities which research can go 
far to solve.

Pitt-Carnegie Frosh Fight Bitter Battle To A Scoreless Tie
While that old hag, Dame For
tune, was busy scowling -on the 
Tech varsity at Notre Dafne Sat
urday, she dispatched her old 
faithful lieutenant, Father Time, 
to give a hearty frown for the 
Plebes. For it was nothing but 
the whistle for the half that pre
vented the Carnegie first year men 
from scoring on the highly touted 
Pitt yearlings, and consequently 
from winning the game.
Chilled by a cold stiff wind, both 
teams fought desperately to break 
the icebut every time one team 
or the other came within scoring 
distance, the opposing line tight
ened up like a Scotchman in a 
night club. No less than three 
times Pitt had the oval within a 
few yards of the Plebcs final 
stripe, but each time the Tech 
line was more than equal to the 
occasion.
Early in the first period Pitt 
carried the ball to the Carnegie 
four-yard line on a forward pass, 
Matcsic to Sebastian. Here the 
Plebes held, and1 'lesser knocked 
Pitts final pass over the end line 
for a touchback. The ball was 
put in play on the Tech twenty 
yard marker, but Tcsscr fumbled 
on the first play the Panthers re
covering it. Again Pitt was held 
for downs. This Avas the last 
time they threatened during the 
first half.
Techs big opportunity came late 
in the second quarter, when two 
forward passes and two beautiful 
uns carried the ball to the Pitt 
three-yard line. As the Carnegie 
boys were coming out of the hud
dle to try and put it over, the 
siren bellowed, and the Tartans 
groaned.
In the last "half the Panther 
Cubs' made a determined effort to 
score, but they found the Carnegie 
line was to strong. Lead by 
Matcsic, , a young man who 'teiirs 
olf yardage through the line with 
discouraging1 precision, Pitt' scored 
three consecutive first downs only, 
to lose the ball by poor passing,. 
Toward the end of the game the 
University boys again worked the 
ball to the Tartan's four^-yard' 
mark and for the third time fail
ed to count. The whistle ended 
last: minute passing attack by Car
negie in midlicld.
Again, as in the Kiski game, 
Teasers punting stood out and 
came to the rescue every time th 
Tech goal line was threatened. 
The work of Forcsman and Lewis, 
workink together on the right side 
of the line,' likewise was outstand
ing.

CROSS-COUNTRYMEN DEFEATED BY GENEVA
The Tartan cross-country team 
fell before the powerful Geneva 
varsity in the first meet of season 
at the Geneva coursc to the tune 
of 20-25 last Friday afternoon. De
spite the biting cold, good time 
was recorded for the enlarged 
Geneva coursc, the time being 
27' 9" with a dead heat for first 
place, with Hunter and Douthctt 
fighting it out for the first posi
tion. The-'two Geneva men were 
closely followed by Captain Pricc 
of Tcch, who was unable to over
come an early lead stacked up by 
the Geneva runners. Inglefield of 
Geneva finished third,., while Ralph 
Frank of Carnegie finished fifth. 
Two more Geneva men, Rcistcr 
and Wilson, took six and seventh 
places, while Lord, Ramsey and 
Silvers, wearing the Plaid, finished 
eighth, ninth and tenth, respec
tively. Only one of the Geneva 
representatives entered in the meet 
failed to place among the coveted 
ten.
It takes a mighty good team to 
triumph on the newly extended 
Beaver Valley coursc, and the Gold 
and White representatives deserved 
to win over the Scots on the 
gruelling coursc, for they present
ed a plucky, determined team.
Following the meet, the Car
negie team was feted to a dinner 
at the college. Plans had been 
made for the team to be the guests 
of Gcnt'va College at a night foot
ball ganrt that evening, but owing 
to the soggy field, the game Was 
postponed until a later date.
Saturday Coach Halfcrtys speed
sters will entertain the Westmin
ster harriers on the Schenley Park 
Course. Little is known about the 
Presbyterians this year, but judg
ing from the past, the New Castleites will have plenty of work 
on their hands.
 The Plcbcs will meet Schenley 
High school in the inaugural meet 
of the season on the Schenley 
Park three-mile coursc. The Year
lings will have a strong team this 
year, with Jones, Wilson, Allen,

WOMENS ATHLETICS
W. A. A. BOARD MEETING
The regular monthly night meet
ing of the Womens Athletic Board 
was held Monday, October 6, in the 
M. M. C. C. Recreation Hall.
The tennis, archery, and hockcy 
managers reported that these sports 
were now in full swing and that 
much enthusiasm has been shown 
by the participants.
Recommendations for the W. A. 
A. Scholarship, which is awarded 
annually, were made. Other sug
gestions are to be turned in to 
Ruth Buckwaltcr, W. A. A. pres
ident. Tips scholarship is awarded 
to a -worthy Carnegie woman on1 
the basis of high scholastic work, 
character, financial circumstances, 
and interest in athletics.
"The Sportwoman, a womens 
athletic magazine, will be available 
to all Carnegie women this year; 
it will be placed on the magazine 
rack in the M. M. C. C. Recreation
hall. This is a very interesting
magazine for the athletic girl; , it 
not only contains new and worth
while' sports for women, but it 
gives accounts of. what other col
legiate institutions arc doing in 
the athletic world.
The list of the total number of 
points received by the members of 
the W. A. A. has been posted on
th<^ W. A. A. bulletin board. All
complaints will receive due attention 
if presented in written form to 
Lois McGregor, vicc president of 
the W. A. A.
It was decided by the board to 
acccpt the proposition of the Phy
sical Education Department to sub 
stitute W. A. A. practice periods 
for gym classes, under the jurisdic
tion and supervision of the Physi
cal Education department.
Archery
Much interest has been shown in 
one of the most delightful of fall 
sports, archery. About twenty-five 
girls report regularly for practice. 
All inexperienced archers must prac
tice during the regular periods, but 
those girls with experience may 
practice other convenient times if 
the time is approved by Dorothj' 
Shulls, archcry manager.
Hiking
Aulma Blessing, hiking manager, 
is planning many organized Satur
day and week-end hikes. Last year 
the girls spent a Saturday and Sun
day at Sky High, a cabin in the 
woods near Butler, from which they 
took short exploring tramps. It is 
hoped that several trips of this 
nature may be made this 3rear.

,VU dont have to make any X one of the teams to have 
"Athletes Foot. The glee club 
probably has some victims. The 
man who gets all his exercise 
out of differential calculus, not 
to mention the "crammer and 
the "plugger, may be wonder
ing about that redness between 
the toes, 'with i-t-c-h-i-n-g. Or it 
may show up with a thick, moist 
skin condition. Or again, with 
tiny blisters on toes, or a dry
ness with scales.
The fact is, all these symptoms 
point straight at the ringworm 
germ known to the boys in 
Science Hall as tinea trichophy
ton. This tiny parasite of the 
vegetable kingdom has infected 
about half the men in college, 
according, to many authorities. 
, The U. S. Health Service reports 
that "at least half of all adults 
suffer from it at some time. 
Universities as far apart as Cal
ifornia and Pennsylvania have 
found 50% of the men infected. 
And the co-eds get it too. Little 
tinea trichophyton has made it
self a campus pest.
It lurks in the very places
where we all go for cleanliness 
and healthon the edges of 
swimming pools and showers{ 
in gymnasiumson locker-and 
dressing room floors. In spite of 
modern sanitation (you have to' 
boil socks 15 minutes to kill it)i

NIGHT INDUSTRIES SMOKER 
OCTOBER 25 
MEN'S GYMNASIUM
Idle*mm
Yes, I received my copy of the 
Plaid, so that definitely establishes 
me as a registered night student, 
even though idle, at Carnegie, and 
it also relieves me of the necessity 
of having to write to the Plaid 
office for my copy.
The last Plaid/stated that'thc 
Night Industries and Night En 
gineering Colleges would hold 
their Smokers on October 25. I 
suppose they will hold them in 
different places, at least they are 
scheduled so in the handbook, and 
it also said that the next issue 
would give particulars which, by 
the way, should reach us not later 
than Tuesday. But why should I 
worrythey dont" have smokers in 
Arts, and since I am an Art Stu
dent, -that lets me out altogether.
Speaking of handbooks, did you 
evbr see such a fine little book to 
write indates, addresses, ; notes 
anil phone numbers? You can just 
bet mine will be full by this time 
three weeks; that is, allowing 
time , out for adjustments, etc.
Went down to the book store 
room last week, and to my sur
prise, I found as big a line as 
they had at registration, or nearjy 
so,; I thought the registration was 
over, but it seems like it is just 
beginning. It might be a good 
plan to establish a new system 
here like they did in the Gym. It 
looked as if there was a bar
gain sale on, just as one sees at a 
department store. They arc surely 
wild for knowledge. You, cant 
keep those night students down.
The tag system has extended to 
the lockers also. I suppose that 
is what is indicated by large tags 
being suspended from various 
lockers . along the corridors of the 
buildings. Some of the students 
evidently thought one locker was 
just as good as another, so when 
lie" got his lock he hied himscli 
tc; the nearest locker and started 
to appropriate it for . his own use. 
I understood that the system em
ployed- was - that- you -secured an 
assignment of a locker after you 
purchased the lock, and then your 
next problem was to find the lock
er. However, a better system was 
used this year, because the lockers 
were given out with a view of lo
cating you as close to your work 
as possible. I have my locker, 
and it is the right number, too, so 
if they tag me, I know what I 
will do.
One would think from the list 
of improvements which were made 
on the Campus the past summer 
that we would see a transformed 
Carnegie, but no such good luck. 
While'"'they were doing the reno
vations, they should have gone a 
little farther and performed an 
operation on the roadway, a sort 
of face-lifting or. .some such trans
formation. I am speaking of the 
yellow horses, which so artis
tically adorn the quadrangle. These 
arc truly eye seres, especially 
when they arc so close to our 
wonderful Fine Arts Building. If 
the roadway is not supposed to 
be used, why in the name of Car
negie dont they put some sort 
of barrier which would reflect with 
favor on us. A memorial gate at 
cac i end of the drive would be an 
idc; 1 way out of this predicament. 
These gates could then be shut.
Night Industries Smoker
Industries Men to Frolic in 
Mens Gymnasium 
October 25
The first semi-annual frolic of 
the Night College of Industries 
will take placc on Saturday eve
ning, October 25 in the Mens 
Gymnasium. To the former stu
dents of Night Industries, this 
function needs no introduction. 
Hpwcvcr, the new students on the 
campus for the first time in Indus
tries will be greeted With a wel
comed surprise when they attend 
this affair.
This function is known as the 
Night College of Industries First 
Semester Smoker and Assembly. 
The affair will be held in the 
large auditorium of the Men' 
Gymnasium, and the festivities 
will start at 7:30 p. m.
Surprises arc' in store for all 
those who attend, and while the 
Committee who is working up the 
affair will not divulge all of the 
particulars, we have it that there 
will be a splendid entertainment 
smokes and a lunch. The Kiltie 
Band in all its splendor will be 
there to help us make merry, and 
you know what a successful or
ganization this band is. Drawings 
for door prizes will take place 
also.
Tlie< Smoker is free to , Night 
Industries men, and tickets of ad
mittance are now being distribut
ed. These tickets will be used for 
the door prize drawings and all 
the Night Industries men should 
secure their tickets . in order to 
participate in the drawing. You 
arc also requested to bring your 
registration card with you for 
identification.
While this affair is called a 
Smoker, it docs not follow that 
only those who smoke will enjoy 
themselves. Entertainment is sup
plied which will meet the require
ments of those students who do 
not smoke.
In the invitation to attend the 
officers of the Night College of 
Industries includes the members 
of the faculty of this college, and 
sincerely hope that as large a 
number of their instructors as pos
sible will attend.-.
An effort is being made to reach 
all the Night Industries men to 
give them their tickets both in 
the class rooms rind in the corri
dors, but if you should be missed, 
you can obtain your ticket at the 
Gymnasium at the time of the 
Smoker by showing your registra
tion card. Dont forgetSaturday, 
October 25, Mens Gymnasium.
Change of Schedule
At this time the Plaid wishes to 
call the attention of the night stud'cnt body to the schedules which 
they .decided upon at the time of 
registration. We are now entering on 
the third week of school, and there 
is possibly some shifting in classes 
and schedules because the original 
selection did- hot meet the require
ments or conditions of these night 
students. A change is no doubt 
neccssary to enable these students to 
obtain the correct instruction, but
Night Engineering Smoker Postponed Until November 1
The Plaid in last weeks issue 
of the Tartan announced the sched
uled election smoker of the Night 
College of Engineering to take 
place on October 25, as' outlined 
in the' "Night Student Carnegie 
Handbook. This smoker was in
tended to be held in the Union.
We regret to, advise that this 
affair will not be held as sched
uled on Octo.ber 25 because some 
of the officers in charge of the 
Engineering Colleges activities fail
ed to make the necessary reserva
tions-for the function. As a last 
minute substitute, the Mens Gym
nasium has been secured for the 
following Saturday, November 1, 
on which to hold the smoker.
We sincerely hope that our 
previous announcement will not 
cause any confusion to the Night 
Engineering men as the Plaid was 
not advised that the Union had 
not been reserved for the Engi
neering Smoker.
The Night Industries Smoker 
will be held as scheduled on Octo
ber 25 in the Mens Gymnasium, 
but the Night Engineering Smoker 
will be postponed until the follow
ing Saturday, November 1. We ex
pect to be able to give you more 
particulars concerning this Smoker 
next week.
There is an announcement rela
tive to the Night Industries Smok
er which WILL be held on Octo
ber 25, elsewhere' on' this page.
Plaid News Contributors
From time to time the Plaid has 
been receiving news contributions 
from the night student body which 
have not been published. This con
dition exists because of several' rea
sons. The most important one is 
lack of available space on our page, 
and the articles, while timely when 
they were written, become useless at 
a later date. Then we have contri
butions which- arc not signed by the 
contributors. In every case the articles 
must be signed by the author, as 
cvidencb of good faith.
We are glad to receive these 
articles, and credit will be given for 
good work, even though we arc. not 
able to use all of the . article as 
submitted. If, therefore, you do not 
see your contribution published, do 
not become discouraged and stop 
sending in more articles, but con
tinue to write, as effort will be 
recognized. While on the subject, the 
Plaid would be glad to receive ar
ticles on subjects which might be of 
interest to the night student body, 
and all those who have ability to write 
should make an effort to comply.
NIGHT STUDENT 
CARNEGIE HANDBOOK 
WELL WRITTEN
By this time every night student 
no doubt has .received their copy 
of the Night Student Carnegie Hand 
book. If you have not, there is one 
for you, provided you have paid the 
activities fee.
Leafing through the pages of this 
handbook causes one to express a 
great deal of praise and admiration 
for the manner in which the author 
has compiled it.
It is bound in red fabricoid, and 
is just the right size to fit neatly 
in ones pocket. There arc a number 
of excellent pictures and views which 
arc entriely new, particularly the ones 
on the fly leaves of the cover, and 
which should be of assistance in 
locating the various buildings on the 
Campus. The contcxt of- the book 
is concise and well gotten up, and 
then too, the diary in the back part 
of the book is very useful.
Mr. James S. Geyser, the Editor 
of the book certainly gave us a very 
fine little handbook, and to him wc 
owe a great debt of gratitude .for 
the pains which, he must have taken 
to edit such a successful book. Mr. 
Geyser, )vc congratulate you.
PLAID MAILING LIST
At the present time the Plaid Mail
ing list is undergoing its yearly 
checkup. This checkup is necessary 
because there arc a large number of 
night students who have changed 
their addresses since their last regis
tration, together with the fact that 
our enrollment of new students con
tinues to swell the list, and also 
that it is necessary to drop those 
students from the list who have not 
returned.
Wc arc making every effort to soc 
that the Plaid is mailed to all the 
night students who have paid the 
Activities Fee, and while it is a 
big undertaking, wc arc making rapid 
progress in securing the new list, 
and the large majority of night stu
dents should be receiving the Tartan 
by this time.
When the record was being made 
out by the students some of them 
failed to give their mailing address,

STEPPING INTO /V MODERN WORR.Es
Scientist and Salesman
THE MODERN PARTNERSHIP
Like every other modern industry, the Bell 
System requires the combined effort of scien
tist and salesman. The commercial man has 
again and again shown the public how to use 
new products of the telephone laboratory, 
and how to make new uses of .existing 
apparatus.
Transmitting pictures arid-typewritten mes- "
sages over telephone wires are services right 
now being actively promoted. Scientific selling 
by long distance is among many ideas origi
nated to increase the telephones usefulness.
In short telephony is a business, with prob
lems that stimulate commercially minded men 
and a breadth of opportunity in step with the 
fast moving world of industry today.

A New Red Menace
Dean Annie Hickinbottom of Hunter College has withdrawn 
the invitation presented to Mr. Heywood Broun, the Socialist 
candidate for Congress from the 17th Congressional District, to 
speak at Hunter College. The reason given by Dean Hickin
bottom was that Mr. Broun was a scheduled speaker at the 
Rand School which she, according to a news item in the New 
York Herald Tribune, described as a "very radical Socialist 
School.It is not for us to argue about the rectitude or evils of 
Mr. Broun's political affiliations; nor is it for us to discuss his 
engagement at the. Rand School which numbers among its 
lecturers such men,as Professor Morris Cohen of City College. 
Dr. Norman Thomas, who is, among his > other attributes, a 
highly educated man, and many other leaders of social and
philosophical thought; but it is for us to raise the issue of
free speech in a city-controlled institution such as Hunter 
College is.Supported by city funds, by taxpayers, who arc persons 
of various political faiths, a city institution should provide an 
open forum for any. one who has something of value to say. 
lias the phobia of socialism in this country' of ours reached 
such a level that, wc should be afraid of listening to a man 
whose daily articles, are read by millions? Have we come to 
a point where wc can cast by the wayside the rights of free 
expression. of opinion, so cherished by those who lifted this
country from servitude and made of it a haven of liberty?
It: has bccomc a sorry state of affairs when an invited 
speaker is refused permission to speak because he is scheduled 
for a lecture on Modern Drama at another institution dubious 
ly classed as dangerous. It is shameful to admit the Jac 
that a person of education, a dean of a widely-known college, 
.should exhibit such narrow-mindedness, such lack of liberality 
especially in an institution unencumbered by the inhibitions, of 
a privaIely-cndowcd college.
The Daily News wishes to place itself on record as proud 
I the action of New York University in having invited Mr. 
I.roun to speak, without any limitations upon the subject of 
his talk, Mr, Broun has already appeared twice at-the Wash 
ingtoii Square College, and will speak again at the Senior 
Chapel at the 'Heights on Monday, according to an announce 
ment .by Dean Thorne. The Daily News congratulates th 
authorities upon their exhibition, of liberality and broadminded 
ness in an institution which* has, in the past, been unjustfully 
accused of prejudice. But, the action of the Dean of Hunte 
College can only be condemned. Not only has the right of 
taxpayers been abused, but the established right of free spcfpi 
has been violated by an institution which should logically 
support that inalienable right; and Dean I lickinbottom should 
not point with pride to this record on the scrolls of Hunte 
College. New York1 University. Daily News.

definite lines in which it is to be 
used. For instance, a coursc in

to be offered to those who wish

Think It Over
Hello Folks I 
All this week the boys and girls 
..ill be recovering from the latest 
South Bender, (apologies to Nancy 
Newman) which died hard Sunday' 
morning for those on the Special, 
nd ever since then for those who 
drove. "That tired feeling around 
the campus isnt due to anything 
j^l.se except the wear and tear on 
Tech constitutions caused by allnight sessions on the train or on 
the road.  .By the shadows under 
their eyes shall you know them, 
those invaders of Indiana.
Jimmy Leonard and Logan (Legs) 
Webster tried their best to get 
the students in good chcering conition on the first section of the 
Special. Cheers led by the two 
were given to Carnegie, the team, 
the policemen, Miss By/d, the por
ters, the Betas, and the Dclts. The 
cheers for the policemen were re
tracted later in the evening, oi 
rather the morning.
Jim Corrigan and Chuck Miller 
ccognized one of their fraternity 
brothers from a Southern chapter 
(not Bobby Jones), but they could
nt understand why he wore the 
white coat with bright buttons. He 
was quite sunburned too.
Phil Magnuson and Jack Boyle 
decided about three aic cm that 
Phil would take out Savoldi and 
Jack would take out Caridco, just 
to help Wally out. Caridco was 
taken but all right, but the only 
one who took out Savoldi was 
Rockne, - according to Jack. Phil 
must have been watching someone1 
n the stands.
Captain Barger of next years 
track team believes in color 
schemes, from the hue of. the 
pyjamas lie paraded around car 
No. 604. They w.ere of a peagreen shade, to go with the darker 
green of the curtains.*
Lin I-Iolveck thought fast .when 
lie told the girls who surprised 
him that he was out for. cross
country. The girls probably knew, 
owever, that no cross-country 
team would wear white shorts with 
orchid stripes.
Nancy Newman received the rush 
from the fatter of the two police
men on the train. She promised to 
let hint call her. uji late some 
stormy afternoon.
It was certain suicide to go 
through, the Kiltie car in thfe dark 
without a body-guard. The funoving Kilts were lying in wait 
with folded newspapers to crown 
the unsuspecting. Thats why dirty 
aughs were heard from several 
spots when the hare-kneed gentle
men faced the icy winds of the 
Notre Dame stadium.
Having come away , from hom< 
without his handkerchief and rub
bers, Harold (Pete) Weitzel de
clined the light green scented hand
kerchief of Miss Byrd to accept 
the large red bandanna of- Mary 
I-Iolveck.
For a promise to name Root 
Knoclcncc, or rather Knutc Rockne, 
in the Who's Whoocy number of 
the Puppet, Charlie Ackenhcil 
watched the game from the glassenclosed press-box, and helped cat 
the sports-writcrs' sandwiches and 
coffee. The Puppet will cost 26 
cents next issue to help pay for 
the editors trip and incidentals.
The chcer-lcadcrs with the stocking-caps and Woolworths gloves 
followed the example of Messrs. 
Widmer, Boyle, Flaherty, Kolb, and 
a few others who had ventured in
to the West without proper equip
ment. Loretta OToole bought a 
stocking-cap too, but she put her 
feet in it at the game. After all,- 
it depends upon where your cir
culation is poorest.
Grace Borgcrding certainly got 
her moneys worth from the trip, 
coming home with one mans glove, 
one "Quiet sign from a Pullman, 
one stocking-cap, and a lot of Notre 
Dame napkins for Mellon Iiall
Betty Steele was entertained 
throughout the trip by Frank
"Should science take a holiday? 
asks Sir'Arthur ICeith. G. K- Ches
terton bclicveS that such a thing 
would be impossible, and he tells 
us why in the magazine section of 
the New York Times of Octobcr 5.
"The curse of the modctn world 
is not merely that every man as
sumes that lie must go on working 
his own machine. It is that he 
assumes that his own machine musf 
go on working him. The motor 
drives the motorist. The type
writer dictates to the typist. Each 
person assumes that the elaborate 
mcchanistn with which lie or she i^ 
conncctcd is bound to go on with 
a sort of iron immortality of its 
own. Wc repeat that the Sabbath 
was made for man and not man 
for the Sabbath, but wc.do ;i:)t 
really feel like ttjat about the work
ing day.  Sunday was made for 
man; but man was made for Mon
day.
"Now one of these machines, 
which men .assume that they must 
work, merely because they arc 
there to be worked, is the great 
machine of modern science. It is 
assumed that science cannot^ lc^ve 
soils unsifted or stars unseen; just 
as it is assumed that The Daily 
Boost cannot leave any cclebrity 
unintcrvicwcd or any crime With
out its glory. It is taken for 
granted that the scientist  must 
carry his investigation to the fixed 
stars if he call; just as it is taken 
for granted'that the salesman must 
sell his sewing machinc or vacuum 
cleaners in the Cannibal Islands if 
he can. In both cases the real 
feeling is that the man must not 
stop, because tlijp machinc must not 
stop. ?
Tlic . detached philosopher also 
has his weaknesses, no doubt; and 
it is an old but fair joke against 
him that (like the man in the 
anecdote) sometimes he sits and 
thinks; and sometimes he just sits. 
But it is a fair retort to say of 
the progressive pioneer, in his rnotimcs he only goes. He only goes 
because the. thing must be kept 
going.
Mr. Chesterton secs the scientist 
as a misguided or rather unguidcd 
individual, continually going on his 
own momentum, and leaving be
hind him suffering and destruction. 
He believes these unthinking per
sons should cease their unharnessed 
activities for a moment in order 
that' they may. think rationally 
about the things which they arc 
doing.
"What is needed is a halt, 
truce, a counscl, a common human 
consideration of what shall be done 
with these things, and especially o'f 
what shall not be done with them. 
But nothing can be done so long 
as the normal citizen remains as a 
merely passive recipient'' of the 
work of the abnormal specialist, 
who has himself no morality ex
cept the monomania that his own 
machinc must be kept working and 
his own particular wheel continue 
to go round.
In stating his facts Mr. Chester
ton seems to have overlooked the 
achievements of science which have 
benefited the world. It is difficult 
to believe that the radio, the air
plane, and Polar expeditions are, 
getting us nowhere fast, and'arc 
merely the result of surplus energy 
or morbid curiosity. It must be 
realized that each one of these is 
only a step; not an end in itself 
but a means to an end. Science 
is not a blind and aimless activity, 
hut is purposeful and controlled. 
For almost everything that is dis
covered, something must be sacri
ficed, and too often the sacrifice is 
mistaken for the result. The sci
entist does not need to call a holi
day to stop and consider what lie 
is doing; he considers as he goes. 
It is the lay public which must be 
educated to protect1 the work of 
science from misuse by the un
scrupulous,-and to iise it as the 
scientist intended it should be used

Dear Sir:
There arc ways and ways of get
ting attention; usually, however, 
some form of display. Attentiongetting is the, only possible motive 
to which I can contribute ypur 
article entitled, "The Social Serv
ice Menace, but your form of dis
play is- unusual. You resorted for 
your exhibit to startling stupidity. 
How fortunate that you can re
main incognito and save your face! 
If anyone knows who you arc, you 
had better bribe him not to tell, 
or you will be disgraced for life.
It is astounding to find a collcgc 
student and above all a Tcch stu
dent (I presume you arc) who 
hasn't the slightest notion of the 
Social Scrvicc or its function as a 
recognizcd profession. What 
more phenomenal is that you have 
the audacity to condemn some
thing which you obviously know 
nothing about. It would be use
less to tell you wherein you are 
wrong, for.,there wasn't a true 
statement in your article.; But it 
might interest you to know that 
Carnegie boasts a high-rating de
partment of Social Work which it 
might profit you to visit. Or, 
considering your present distaste 
for social workers due to some 
distorted misconceptions, you would 
do well to go' toy the library and 
read up on the.subject.
At any rate, I suggest that you 
take immediate steps to prevent 
any similar display, of your ignor
ance. And, being big-hearted, Ill 
start your education by telling you 
that social workers dont take 
blood counts.

It so happened that -wc drove 
East the other day, . and at the 
urgent behest of a charming young 
lady stopped off at Bryn Mawr 
to witness what is called "Lantern 
Night. Wc were very glad we 
did so.
Never have wc seen anything 
quite s6 beautifully and mystically

after a drive through the Main 
Line territory, ancient stronghold 
of families steeped^ in Revolution-, 
ary valor. The. .concrete roadi is. 
bordered by magnificent estates, 
acrcs of well-kept Ja\yps and shrub

which would shame a Hollywood

friends, and standards of livin

does she get along with her own 
familythe people who, -after all, 
know her best?
So there you are, John Doc, with 
a concrete standard by which to 
judge womankind. But we beg of 
you not to be too stringent in 
your ratings, and to remember that 
youll never find a perfect female, 
so be content with, the old love if 
slve he anywhere near the 900 mark!
you find yourself standing on . a 
roofless, toi,vcr under the stairs.
Below is a black square, bordered 
by four Gothic arched cloisters. 
There is a long 'silence broken 
only by the Aistle of the leaves' 
the trees. . . "
And then, gradually and very 
faintly comes a low and distant 
chanting. It ebbs and floods and 
then disappears; and then amplifies 
with new strength and volume, it 
draws closer. Now you can recog
nize a chorus of young women's 
.Voices chanting plaintively ancient 
Grecian melodies.
And then -a long,. mysterious rdW 
of tiny purple-violet lights appear, 
moving in sinuous lines. The . 
chanting increasesits tempo,, now  
filing the whole square. Four 
?golden lanterns-' appear in the 
corners of the.clois't',ers, illuminatcacli a majestic, female figure 
draped \ in a white robe. The 
lanterns rise and fall rhythmically 
with each beat of the song. 
f. The line of purplc.-violct flickers 
moves. Shrouded shapes sway 
solemnly. The. procession of the 
neophytes has begun. And all the 
time, the primitive, .beat of maiden 
voices,-; of ancicrit .Grecian melody, 
of rhythmic lantern waving, of sil
ver moonlight, fuse, into the wierd 
symphony of the night.
The purple-violet flickers form 
fantistic designs against the dark
ness of/ the square. Tli'c gowned 
forms march majestically; the pat
terns change; and all the time tjie 
chant beats on. Then the flickers 
begin to pass between the arches 
of the cloister-,:, and each Gothic
frame reflects a living shrouded 
portrait.
And. suddenly, the chant ebbs 
and disappears, Hie last purpleviolet lantern vanishes, and wc are 
left again with the darkness -of
the Middle' Ages. . . .
Until the whirring propeller and 
guide' lights of the night mail plane 
against the stars, call us back to

It is a fact proven by sales figures that

Is such leadership ever an accident?
You know the answer. These sophisti

like Sheaffers individualized pen points, 
that they like the comfortable Balance0 
designed into Sheaffers, that they like 
the streamlined, modem contour of the

Learbury Designers 
Never
..... They Find Out First
Dont look for the bizarre, the freakish style in 
a Learbury model ... it is never to be found. The 
personal whims or ideas of designers are com
pletely absent. Instead, Learbury goes right to the 
leading campuses of the coufitry and assures cor
rectness for its style by consulting college leaders 
and adopting their style preferences.
The success of this plan is proved by the fact that 
authentic college clothes mean Learbury wher
ever you go.
