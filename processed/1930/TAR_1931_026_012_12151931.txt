A COLUMN OF CURIOUS COMMENT 
BY NATHAN MILLER 
This recent flair for freshness 
what may it denote? We refer to 
the amazingly widespread interest 
in pristine-pure, unsullied commo
dities packed, so that no human 
hand may touch them, the nonrefillable container, the unbroken 
seal, dated coffee, etc. And the 
epitome of all this technique is 
that ingenious, film-like diaphanous 
substance which spreads its diseasedefying layers about packagescel
lophane.
Manufacturers vie with each oth
er in purveying a more immaculate 
and transparent layer of this ma
terial about our cigarets, /food, 
clothes, and. where it will end, no 
man knoweth. Soon new houses 
will be delivered straight from the 
maker all ensconced in the purity 
of the new born babe. Undoubt
edly, we must seek deeper sig
nificance and import in this revived 
passion for the emblems and outer 
tokens of antiseptic virtue.
^Perhaps it may connote the fact 
that the world is- returning again 
to the ascetic ways of life and js 
turning away from the grime, the 
 dross and the filth of the work
aday world. Perhaps this groping 
for. cleanliness has its roots in the

ETA KAPPA NU 
CALLS NEW MEN
On Friday evening, December 11, 
Sigma Chapter of Eta Kappa Nu, 
Carnegies electrical engineering 
honorary fraternity, made its formal 
call in the banquet hall of Carnegie 
Inn. The men who received their 
pledge colors are: Richard S.
Smithley, Sr., Walter E. Osborn, 
Sr., John E. Hardy, Sr., William H. 
Nichols, Jr., and Wilfred R. Uffelman, Jr.
Sigma Chapter requires a 4.0 
scholarship average as a qualifica
tion for membership. Members are 
chosen from men in the junior and 
senior classes who by their attain
ments in college or in practice 
manifest exceptional interest and 
marked ability in electrical engin
eering. The fraternity is designed 
for closer co-operation among, and 
mutual benefit to, students and 
others in the electrical profession.
The pledges have already started 
work on their duties and it is the 
hope of the chapter that the formal 
initiation may follow directly after 
the Christmas season in order that 
the seniors may have as long an 
active membership before gradua
tion as is. possible,

STUDENTS VISIT 
HERE SATURDAYS
THISTLE PLANS 
VIEW SECTION
The staff of the 1932 edition of 
the Thistle is planning an unusually 
interesting view section for this 
years Thistle. Several processes 
are being considered by the staff, 
particularly a type of Rotogravure 
and Fulltone process.
Among the new and interesting 
views which have been taken are 
views from the top of Park Man
sions, a new view of Machinery 
Tower, and others as equally un
usual. Altogether, the new view 
section will contain about 13 pic
tures.
Samples-of the section will be on 
the campus soon. If the demand 
becomes large enough, these sec
tions will probably be sold sepa
rately and at a very reasonable 
price,
The Saturday morning visits to 
oUr engineering laboratories by 
high school seniors, which were 
introduced this fall, were very suc
cessful during the month of No* 
vember. Delegations from the fol
lowing high schools were received: 
October 31, Perry High; November 
7, Bellevue High; November 14, 
Edgcwood High; November 21, 
Wilkinsburg High.
The groups average about 25 in 
number and arc limited to students 
who are interested in technical sub
jects. The vocational guidance of
ficers of the high schools report 
that there is a marked interest in 
these Saturday morning visits and 
that the experiment is a valuable 
par.t of the vocational guidance pro
gram on the high schools. It is 
planned to  continue their visits 
throughout the winter and spring 
months.

COUNCIL URGES 
REDUCTION OF 
HOLIDAY CUTS
Executive Board To Judge 
1931-32 School Yar 
As A Trial
CO-OPERATION NEEDED
Return To Penalty System 
May Result From 
Increased Cuts
The Student Council, in view of 
the 50 per cent increase of the cut
ting of classes, has issued a warn
ing and plea to the students urging 
them to better the attendance rec
ord before and after the Christ
mas holidays. The Councils ap
peal is as follows:
Due to the increased number of 
absences before and after holiday 
periods, it is necessary to inform 
the student body that if this con
tinues in connection with the 
Christmas recess it may mean the 
adoption of a severe penalty for 
cuts. We appeal to all the stu
dents of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology to help prevent a re
turn to the penalty system by not 
abusing the privileges we all enjoy 
now.
.(Signed) Student Council.
For .the trial period which lasts 
during the 1931-32 school year the 
customary practice of giving a 
count for an uncxciiscd absence has 
been discontinued in order to es
tablish definitely whether or not a 
penalty system is necessary to sus
tain attendance before and after 
vacation periods. These absences 
are being reported so that at the 
end of the year they may be judg
ed by the Executive Board, who 
will make a decision on the basis 
vf these figures.
i Similar difficulties are bfcing en
countered at most American col
leges and universities, and are met 
by-measures of varying stringency, 
including financial assessment, low
ering of grades, reduction of credit 
for the' semesters work, exclusion 
from a final examination, or the 
dropping of a course.
DELTA SKULL TO 
HOLD TEA DANCE
A dance, to be known as the 
Junior Prom Tea Dance; will be 
sponsored by the Delta , Skulls to
morrow afternoon at the Union 
from 4 to 6 oclock. The Black 
Cat Orchestra will furnish the mu
sic for the affair.
Tickets for the dance may be 
purchased either from a member 
of the Delta Skulls or at the door 
at 25 cents for women and 50 cents 
for men.
Joseph Bronson, chairman, has 
arranged several novel features for 
the afternoon. These include a 
lucky number prize of a ticket for 
the Men's Junior Prom and a 
booth where detailed information 
may be obtained on the orchestras 
being considered for the Prom. A 
vote will be taken on the orches
tras which will determine the final 
selection.

Betty Co-ed Disapproves Of Sharing 
Cost Of Date With Joe College
What kind of food do you order 
after an evening* of dancing and 
laughter? Is your appetite keener 
at 2 a. m. than at 8 a. ni.? Perhaps 
a cup of. coffcc and a minced ham 
sandwich will tide you over un
til morning, or maybe your diges
tive system dotes on chicken sand
wiches and pic a la mode. But 
whatever the preference, Joe Col
lege and Betty Co-ed always take 
time out for a bite to cat before 
saying good-night. ("Always" 
may not be the correct word, be
cause now comes the news that the 
depression has caused the cds of 
many universities to limit the co
eds in ordering refreshments.)
The hot special, so popular at 
Gammon's Hilan house, would 
prove far too expensive for the 
men who date a certain sorority at 
Ohio State. The members of this 
organization (sorry, but wc cant 
satisfy your curiosity) have pledg
ed themselves not to cat more 
than 15 cents worth of food when
their boy friends take them into 
campus beaneries. And a foot
note to the news says that the 
girls are some of the most popu
lar femmes on the campus. An
other sorority at the University of 
Missouri has gone one better. 
These girlies pledge themselves to 
a five-ccnt soda fountain bill when 
on a date with a college man. 
(Thank goodness, someone devised 
Coco-Cola for a nickcl.)
The depression has certainly 
caused many changes in the social 
relationships of Mr. and Miss CoEd. The men of Southern Califor
nia University have formed a 50-50 
club, with the understanding that 
the girl pay for her share of the 
date. But now the dear girlies have 
squelched the men by refusing 
to date gigolos. The students of 
the University of Utah have de
vised a different arrangement. It 
is known as the Arizona Plan 
for the relief of romantic but finan(Continucd on Page Two)

Professor Kalman has spent five 
ydars studying mathematics, phys

spent -four years in the field of 
civil engineering. Although he has 
done some work in surveying and 
railroad construction, his main ef
forts have been almost exclusively 
devoted toward reinforced concrete

TECH GUILD AIDS 
NEEDY FAMILIES
Gives Direct Financial Aid During Holidays
The Guild, womens philanthropic 
organization of Carnegie, has ap
propriated $50 for the Family Wel
fare Association of Pittsburgh in 
an effort to bring happiness to sev
eral needy families during the com
ing holiday season. Social workers 
have studied the cases of large 
families in which the father is sick 
or unemployed and will distribute 
the money according to the needs 
of the family.
Baskets are no longer given as 
Christmas gifts, because social 
workers have found that the con
tents are often not exactly what is 
needed and because the pride of 
the family must be considered. 
Direct 'financial aid by an organ
ized charitable society is more ef
fective and more efficient than 
individual contributions. The money 
will be given to the family by the 
worker in change of the case with 
suggestions for its use. Miss Meyer, 
instructor in the Margaret Morri
son Social Service Department, has 
been directing the members of the 
Guild in their work.
The Guild has accomplished many 
philanthropic purposes since its or
ganization at Carnegie. Two years 
ago a room was furnished at the 
Kingsley Settlement House; last 
year milk was provided to several 
lidmcs; this year, in addition to the 
Christmas project, milk will again 
be given to needy families. TheGuild is forming plans to conduct 
supper meetings during the coming 
season, and to hold a dance in 
order to increase its fund for 
broadening the scope of its philan
thropic activities.

Objections Are Raised To 
Shortened Rushing 
Season
FACULTY APPROVES
Is Successful In Reducing 
Rushing Season 
Expenses
Carnegies one week rushing sea
son, initiated this year as an emergencjr measure in order to alleviate 
fraternity expenditures, ended Sun
day night with the pledging of 175 
new members to the 19 campus 
fraternities. As Ava's anticipated, 
this number represents a decrease 
over that of last year, although 
when those pledges who have de
layed their final decisions until 
after Christmas vacation have been 
added to this list, the total may 
be increased considerably.
From the reports received from 
the various fraternities there are 
indications to believe that the ab
breviated rushing season was suc
cessful in accomplishing its primary 
aim, that of reducing the financial 
expenses; but in other respects, 
however, several objections were 
raised by both the fraternities and 
the rushccs. The fraternities are 
of the opinion that the intensive 
one week rushing period docs not 
enable them to become sufficiently 
acquainted with the rushccs, who, 
in their desire to visit each fra
ternity at least once, cannot pro
long their visit to any one frater
nity. With only six nights, the 
rushccs must visit at least three 
fraternities per night, in order to

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, DECEMBER' 15, 1931.
TARTAN SPORT, S PAGE
CARNEGIES OFFICIAL BASKETBALL SCHEDULE 
will begin to unravel on Thursday evening as the majority of 
the student body entrains for the popular Christmas recess. 
This Southern invasion into certain sunny Spots of the court world will begin Wednesday night when Coach Hogan leaves 
with a dozen Skibo stars to engage two strong Kentucky 
teams.Much interest is connected with the opener against Ken
tucky Wesleyan for the Southerners believe they have the best 
team in the history of their school, but this pebble is not the only one on the beach, because Plaid followers, who have 
watched their team closely, believe that this statement can be applied with more truth to the Tartan floor men. While in 
the same vicinity, the University of Kentucky will entertain 
Hogans tossers with a game on Friday night. The results of this contest should favor the Plaid by a comfortable margin.
The St. Xavier game this Saturday could provide plenty 
of trouble, and a Skibo victory would be well worth it, for the Saints rate high in their Ohio conference. With the foregoing 
conclusions it seems very possible that Carnegie will enter the Yale game with the confidence of victories over three fair teams. 
And before we read another Tartan, Buzz Hogan expects to double the winning column.*****
AS' FAR AS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL con- dition go the varsity floor men possesshealthy share of both. A fighting spirit, typical 
of that shown by the football squad, has been, carried to the gym where each player has set 
himself for an all-Carnegie season. It is also expected that the Plaid quintet will pull several 
of their games out of the proverbial fire, for
there is already evidence that the boys can get
* liotV in staging a come-back.Among his minor problems Coach Iiogan
must select his starting lineup from a group of six first stringplayers. This becomes quite a job when such men as Captain
Leonard, Smith, Jagnow, Radabaugh, Stentz and Fergus must 
be considered.*****
PLEBE BASKETBALL PLAYERS announced their in
tentions of a successful campaign when they defeated the Y. M. H. A. reserves, 45 to 28. With a consistent offense and fair 
defense, the freshmen will arrive at the beginning of their regu
lar schedule in good condition.*****
TWO OF THE BOXERS had a chance _ to test: their 
wares in the front line trenches at the Motor Square Garden 
last Friday evening. This benefit performance brought out the 
fact that there arc two Skibo ring m<?n with much more than just.mediocre ability. Jeff Burke required but'one minute and a half to put his opponent out of the way in the JGO-pQund 
' class, while Tom Waldron tarried for two minutes and forty 
seconds before his partner took the gate. These boys put their idea of boxing across in fine style, and their performances this 
winter will make a big difference in the coming: schedule.Jeff Burke, the sophomore Dramat, justified his trip to the 
international amateur tournament in Boston last week. Jeff 
easily won his first bout, but a close decision gave Baillargcon, of Montreal, the verdict in his second attempt. The accounts 
credit (lie Slcibo star with superior form throughout' his matches.
More plans are being completed for the home contests in the boxing line. A demountable ring will be available in the 
center of the basketball court so that (he existing bleachers will hold the spectators. It is very probable that one section 
of the ring side will be reserved for those in.the formal attire. This intercollegiate tradition is very nearly a requirement at 
some colleges, and is consistent with the brand of sportsman
ship that is portryed in such places.
* * * * *
DURING THE COURSE of the Thanksgiving Day game with New York University this season the Carnegie Institute 
presented the Violet authorities with a set of miniature bronze goal posts to commemorate the fine spirit of the meeting three 
years ago.The 1928 clash for the championship of the East resulted in a Violet victory with the score of 27 to 13. It may be 
remembered that Pittsburghs Finest rose to nation-wide fame 
when they proceeded to jail the N. Y. U. students for dislodging the Carnegie goal posts. Although the "hams of the law 
arc unchanged, the feeling between the two schools has improved greatly, and the New Yorkers are gratified by the recent 
exhibition of friendship.*****
WITH THE BASKETBALL TEAM advancing in fine style, an interested 
party ^ has made the suggestion that organized cheering at the games would 
add to the moral of the team. The poor attempts of the past might have 
been justified by the teams of those------------------ days, but now the student body hassomething to shout about. It is also thought tiiat the well- known Kilty Band could put on some sort of an exhibition 
between the halves, and thus, make a Carnegie basketball game friore of an event.
* * * * *
INTRAMURAL COURT TEAMS are beginning to prepare for an active season. A schedule should be ready by thefirst of the year. Seven minute quarters were the order of last
years games, and Mr. Mosses is especially anxious that each 
player be in good physical condition so that a fast game of basketball will prevail.

dally embarrased males. Dates 
are not to cost more than $1.98, 
and the girls must share the cost 
on an equality basis. As a conces
sion, the men voted that under 
the equality plan, co-eds could with 
propriety ask for dates instead of 
waiting to be asked in boom titries! 
(Imagine dear sisters, going to 
your Suppressed Desire and asking 
him for a date with the under
standing that you would pay onehalf of the cost.)
Fearing that the slump might 
mean a depression in dates this 
winter, Boston University girls 
have organized a back-to-thc-dormitory movement for their men

promises to be as popular again

Courtmen Set For Opener
SIX CONTESTS ON 
HOLIDAY SCHEDULE
Kentucky Wesleyan Sends Strong Five Against Tartan Clan
Carnegie Techs basketball team 
opens its 1931 basketball season 
Thursday night in Winchester, 
Kentucky, where they meet Ken
tucky Wesleyan. It is the first of 
a series of 26 games, and after 
the opener the squad will get little 
rest until the season is over. The 
Tartan squad has been out prac
ticing for nearly a month and dur
ing that time Coach Hogan has 
been working hard to bring his 
men into shape for the opening 
games. The results of his work 
cannot be foretold, but from all in
dications the Tartans should have 
a banner year.
During Christmas vacation the 
Skibo team will meet six strong 
teams. In their short southern jaunt 
they engage the University of Ken
tucky and St. Xavier,* in addition 
to Kentucky Wesleyan. The first 
home game is scheduled on De
cember 23 with the strong Yale 
five. After a few days intermis
sion for Christmas, Coach Hogan 
and his team journey to Buffalo 
and then to Chicago, meeting the 
Universities of these two cities.
Defeat Y. M. H. A.
So far Carnegies quintet has 
had two warm-up games, winning 
both. The last one was Thurs
day night with Y. M. II. A. in 
which Jimmy Leonard  and his 
mates were trailing at the end of 
the first half, but by a last quar
ter rally, were finally able to 
emerge victorious. The store was 
41-31. At the end of the half the 
Tartans were behind 21-16, but in 
the second half Bob Smith got his 
eagle eye working and scored 11 
points, which put his team ahead 
and enabled them to win the game. 
Louie Jagnow was the high scorer 
in the first half. The starting line 
up was: Stentz, center; Smith and 
Jagnow, forwards; Leonard and 
Raudabaugh, guards. Jim Fergus, 
who had been confined to his home 
on account of sickness, is back 
with the squad and will be ready 
for action in the first game.
Skibo Court Mentor
COACH BUZZ HOGAN
Coach Ralph Buzz Hogan, for
mer Iowa star, who starts his third 
season as floor coach at Carnegie 
this year.
Since the advent of the Hogan 
system at Carnegie, Skibo floor 
squads have once more assumed 
a ranking position in district bas
ketball . circles. Taking over an 
outfit that had won but four games 
in three seasons Hogan scrapped 
the old system and installed one 
of his  own. The new system is 
oiie of the most diversified and 
sparkling employed in this district 
and always insures a good game 
for the spectator.

PLEBES PREPARE 
FOR HARD GAMES
Defeat Y. M. H. A. Reserves, 45-28; McDonald High Next On Schedule
Having tucked a victory for the 
first gamft in the bag, the Plebe 
basketballcrs are now gunning for 
another practice game and then for 
a flock of conference tilts. They 
meet McDonald High in a prelimin
ary to the Carnegic-Yale varsity 
game on December 23.
A fairly smooth functioning of
fense put the Plcbcs on the. better 
side of the Y. M. C. A. reserves 
last Thursday by a score of 45-28. 
McLanahan, playing forward, was 
able time and again to sink the ball 
from beneath the hoop. The op
ponents, on the other hand, were 
restricted the whole game to trying 
long shots. There was a good bit 
of running up and down the court on 
the part of both teams, but the 
Plebcs often punctured the enemy 
defense with pot-shots.
Smooth passing on the offense wi.t 
help the Plebes game immensely, and 
no doubt this department will be in 
better shape for the next whistle. 
Coach Ncase has scheduled workouts 
over most of the vacation to iron 
out the irregularities in time for the 
conference debut.
McLanahan chalked up the major 
part of the Tech score with Carlson 
as his running mate at the forward 
post. Riggs and McCalnyon did jus
tice to the guard position and Ewalt 
played a good game at center. Riggs 
acted as captain for his teammates.

COACH ERNIE SESTO
Ernie Sesto, who is beginning 
his second year as the Tartan 
boxing coach, was at one time an 
Olympic champion of the 125 pound 
class. He is also connected with 
the Pittsburgh Lyceum.
Coach Sesto is solely responsi
ble for the progress of Skibo box
ers. His material has been fair, 
and in many cases he has brought 
an experienced man to the 
heights of a worthy opponent. 
Even with their tough schedule, 
Ernie has confidence that his squad 
will make a creditable showing. 
Hes a man for action, and further 
demonstrates his instruction, by 
putting on the gloves.
team to a point last year, for the 
first time, where the Tartans won 
the majority of their games. This 
was most gratifying in view of the 
fact that th# team met the best the 
country had to offer.
Plaid Boxers Open 
Season With West 
Virginia Janaury 16
Carnegie Mitmen Impressive In Bouts At Motor Square
Carnegie Tech is about to begin 
its second venture into the collegiate 
boxing world. Putting a team in the 
field for the first time last year, the 
Tartan clan early established itself 
as definitely above the setup class.
One significant point demonstrating 
the popularity of the sport was that 
the W. and J. match last February 
outdrew any other athletic function 
on the campus with the exception of 
the football games. In spite of the 
Skibos failure to win a single meet, 
the attendance grew with every 
match.
If boxing can make such headway 
in one year with such handicaps as 
Coach Sesto and his msn had to 
work with, the sport should grow 
phenomenally with capable mat;rial 
and a schedule such as the figlung 
Scots have this season, Opposed to 
them this year will be such veteran 
teams as West Virginia, Yale, Syra
cuse, Bucknell, Pitt and Wash.-Jeff.
That ^Carnegies team of inexpe
rienced mitters should be able to 
cope with such a formidable array 
of talent sounds unbelievable, but the 
fact remains that the Tartan squad 
is not entirely made up of novices. 
The one round knockouts scored by 
Jeff Burke and Tom Waldron out 
at Motor Square Garden last Friday 
evening are indications of what may 
be expected from these two capable 
boys during the season. Carr has 
also gained much, valuable experience 
during the last twelve months, and 
Coach Sesto is banking heavily on 
him. Wertz and Atlas, two impres
sive boys from last years freshmen 
squad, also look like good bets. 
Ineligibilities, of course, have ham
pered the Tartan mentor.
Boixng is one of the most interest
ing of college sports to watch. Dif
fering radically from professional 
boxing it is a sport in which one 
man has to do. all his own thinking 
and acting. Fast, shifty action pre
vails throughout, and uneven con
tests are stopped before any damage 
is done.
Whether or not Alex Ducanis, cap
tain of last years squad, will come 
out for boxing this season is still in 
doubt. AJcx was the one man who 
consistently made trouble for his 
highly-touted rivals during the la3t 
campaign. He won two decisions 
and fought two draws out of five 
bouts.
General Manager Bill Tauriello, 
who has had much experience in 
training boxers, js working hard to 
round his boys into perfect condition.

Anyone who wishes to take part in 
this activity is urged to come down 
to the range now. Matches will 
begin about the last of January.
Bowling 
The bowling season of 1931 is 
over; the tournaments were played 
off last week. Since very few girls 
came out for bowling the girls hav
ing the required number of practices 
were placed on three color teams, 
Red, Blue and Green. The Red team 
won the bowling contest with an 
average score of 84, the Green team 
was second with an average score of 
77, and the Blue team was last with 
an average score of 75.
The members of the Red team

NIGHT ENGINEERING 
BANQUET TO BE HELD 
ON DECEMBER 17
Webster Hall Selected 
For The Scene Of The 
Seventeenth Annual
On Saturday next the Night 
College of Engineering will hold 
the seventeenth annual banquet, 
time when the night students reg
istered in this college will dine 
and make merry, forgetting their 
daily grind, and nightly, too, of 
calculus, mechanics, physics, et al.
Nothing has been left undone by 
the officers to make this get-togcther party a real success. They 
promise you the best two dollars 
worth you have ever obtained. 
Some well known artists and en
tertainers have been secured to 
help you enjoy the bounteous meal 
which will be set before you, and 
which we understand will be fit for 
a king.
The banquets which have been 
offered each year for the entertain
ment of the night engineers fur
nish an opportunity of meeting 
your various classmates and have 
been well attended, and it is hoped 
that this years affair will show 
the usual enthusiasm and large atteiidance. You can forget the seri
ousness of life for the evening and 
indulge in frivolity and be the 
wiser for having done so. Ask 
anyone who attended last years 
banquet and you arc sure to pur
chase a ticket right now. Even 
if you had made a date a long time 
ago, cancel it, as you are dated for 
this affair at Webster Hall Hotel. 
No other function can take its 
place; 110, not even the girl friend. 
Just tell her, and she'll excuse you 
for the evening.
A thorough canvass of all the 
night engineers is being made by 
ticket sellers and they-are working 
to make the affair a complete suc
cess; help them to do it. Remem
ber, that the price is only two dol
lars and you are promised the best 
entertainment ever. Let the slogan 
of the night engineers be See you

Masons (iretftmr*ONCE more the holiday season is upon us. Those 
days when tolerance towards our fellow man becomes more of a reality than at any other 
time during the year. The season when we 
feel a little more kindly toward everybody and everythingwhen our smile seems to have a 
little more meaning and peace on earth and 
to men of good will make the world a better place in which to live.
The Plaid, through the members of its 
Staff, wishes to take this opportunity to wish for all the student body, night and day; for 
those of the teaching faculty, and for those of the administra
tion, the merriest of Christmases and the happiest of New Years. May this-Christmas season and the coming New Year see the fulfillment of }-our fondest dreams so that yours will be a life 
of joy and happiness.*****
Night College Of Engineering Banquet
Not many more daysi remain before the Night College of Engineering will get together for the^annual banquet. This is a 
night campus function which has become dear to the night engi
neering men and the holding of the affair is campus tradition, 
and well it should be. In the march of time groups have come 
and gone and new men have taken hold where those who have gone before left off. In this onward march it is inevitable that 
improvements should be made since the first holding of the 
banquet seventeen years ago, and they have. Many uphill 
obstacles were encountered but the march went onward until today the officers of the Night College of Engineering are once 
more ready to offer their classmates the traditional banquet.Are the night engineering students ready to support these 
officers in helping them make a success of their efforts? They 
have worked to have this banquet a fitting companion of other 
years and let it not be said that they worked in vain. It is a fact that business conditions are not what they should be and 
many of the night, students have been forced to economize, but it is also true that a large number of night engineering students 
could spare the cost of a banquet ticket from their budget.
There is nothing so discouraging to those in charge of an affair than to receive a slow response^to the appeal made for 
support. You are promised a' very fine banquet both as re
gards the plate which will be served, and the incidental enter
tainment. Are you going to co-operate? Of course you are, and you are going to secure your ticket this week, then on 
Saturday evening your attendance at Webster Hall will show 
in a concrete way that your officers have not worked in vain.

CARNEGIES LONG 
DISTANCE TRAVELER
The contest is on and the excite
ment mounts higher and higher. It 
looks as though wc may have to 
call out the state troopers and the 
national guard to maintain order. 
Claiments from New Kensington 
had their dreams rudely shattered 
by the vociferous clamoring from 
Grecnsbitrg, including Red Onion. 
No quarter is asked and none isgiven; pay your own train fare, 
its a war to the finish with the 
winner very much in doubt. Wp 
have a feeling that it will be a 
dark horse; theres a dark horse in 
every race, but we dont know 
whether it will be a Pcnnsy flier or 
a B. & O. express. You guess, 
wc feel kind of tired.
Do wc hear someone ask what 
this is all about? Tsk, tsk, dont 
you read the poipers? Why, you 
must be behind the times, not to 
know what this great contest -is 
all about. Now here is the low 
down: The Plaid is conducting a 
contest to find Carnegies cham
pion long distance traveling night 
student and wants to hear from all 
the commuting boys and girls, 
bless em. We are forccd to limit 
this contest to night students only 
since its sinister purpose can be 
carried on only under cover of 
darkness. Send in your traveling 
membership; you might be the 
winner. Yes, you might get the 
surprise package, this much sought 
after title, hooray 1
Drop a note to the News Editor

INTERESTING AFFAIR
First Night Arts Dance Of Year At Union Attracts Colorful Crowd
One of the most colorful night 
social features on the campus was 
inaugurated last Saturday, Decem
ber 5 at the Union, with the hold
ing of the first Night Arts Dance 
of the season. It was a gay and 
friendly crowd that threw care to 
the winds, and danccd to the mer
ry tunes of the Rythm Ramblers.
These affairs which arc free to 
those night students who arc reg
istered in the College of Fine Arts, 
have attracted much favorable com
ment in the past, and last Satur
days dance was certainly over
whelming assurance of their con
tinued popularity.
That gay, friendly atmosphere 
which always prevails at these 
dances, is fast becoming tradition, 
and was more than evident last 
Saturday.
If a smile is the gauge with 
which to chcck the evident pleasure 
of the masses, then this gathering 
rated ninety-nine and nine-tenths 
per cent. Yes, we observed two 
sad-eyed young ladies who were 
obviously bored by tlicir escorts 
inccssant shop talk between sips of 
punch.
Two great canopies formed by 
streamers, were the b^tsis of a nov
el decorativc scheme which was 
carried out in pleasant green and 
white, and added much to the gaycty of things.
Every intermission brought pn 
a veritable stampede to the punch 
bowls, where cakes and delicious 
punch mixed to the kings taste, 
were being served to the thirsty 
revelers.
Chaperons for the occasion were

POLLOCK TALKS 
ON LITERATURE
Playwright Declares Modern Writers Concerns Are Materialistic
Channing Pollock, a well-known 
American playwright, dispelled the 
sordidness of life pictured by most 
modern writers and planted new up
lifting thoughts in the minds of the 
mixed audience who heard his talk 
on Modern Literature last Wednes
day.
Mr. Pollock understands literature 
to mean books, playsyes, and even 
the motion picture. Some of the 
gleanings of his talk arc:
"Modern writers lack imagination 
and have too much concern for ma
terialismthey give facts of life 
which we can sec every day on the 
street instead of giving the truths of 
life which wc must unearth even as 
the miner must remove top layers of 
debris to find gold 
"The fact that out of 211 plays 
produced last year 173 dealt with 
crime and sex shows how deep in 
the mire, our modern literature is 
'that' standing, in the gutter, denies 
us the right to look at the stars.'
"Literature should be a reflection 
of public thought which, if presented 
as the trutlVs of life would never be 
ugly; whereas modern literature re
flects the thoughts and actions of a 
peculiar group of people who repre
sent a small percentage of the popu
lation.
In reply to a question by a Tartan 
reporter at an interview following 
the address as to whether any im
provement had been noted in the type 
of literature, Mr. Pollock stated: 
"It is improving; the sale of good 
books is improving, and the vigorous 
authors of the day arc aiding in a 
move toward fine literature again. 
With such ideals as these Mr. 
Pollock has built "The House Beauti

Players at the Alvin this week.

Student Opinion
The editorial columns of a camps newspaper are not 
intended to reflect the opinions of one person or one group, 
but should prove the means of expressing and co-ordinat
ing the convictions of the interested majority. Should the 
occasion arise where an injustice is done a group by an 
opinion published as an editorial expression, the fact should 
be known.
Since the editorial last week dealing with tHe football 
situation at Carnegie, the football team and the Athletic 
Council have come out unanimously in favor of retaining 
the present coaching staff. -Presented here is ac sttemeiit 
from the captains of the football team who are representing 
the entire squad:
"The varsity football squad wishes to take exception 
to the editorial in The Carnegie Tartan, issue of Decem
ber 8. .
Never has a football squad and its coaches been closer 
to one another than during the season just closed. Never 
in Judge Steffens long and honorable-career at Carnegie 
did he command any mor respect, confidence and affection 
than was tendered him by the 1931 team members, and, 
in return, we believe that he has a high regard for. us. He 
has so told us.
The squad has been much disturbed by the Decem
ber 8 editorial. It feels that it has .been done an injustice. The squad is tremendously interested in having Judge 
Steffen reconsider his decision, and return in- 1932, and 
just as long thereafter as he finds it possible.
As representatives of the squad, we have talked to all 
the players, and this represents their unanimous sentiment.

Vacations and Absences
Vacations from school Work are seemingly arranged to 
come at just the time when the 'harassed student is in most need of relief. Sometimes it happens that the over
anxious anticipate their vacation to the extent of leaving a day or two in advance of the schedule date. In the past 
years a penalty, purporting to be severe, was attached, to 
an unexcused absence from'any class on the day preceding a . holiday or following its conclusion.  -
The penalty, being ineffective; has been waived this year, and a survey is to be taken to determine if: the num
ber of persons who take cuts on the days in: question necessitates any action. In case the 'class attendance is not 
seriously affected the penalty will be permanently revoked. Should any action be necessary, no .doubt some procedure 
more effective than the prior system- will be forthcoming. 
Perhaps the five dollar fine provision at some colleges or some similar forfeit undesired by the students will, be 
imposed, should little'heed be given, the request of student 
council for full attendance until vacation actually begins on Thursday evening.

Newspapers
If all the newspapers in the world were wiped out and all the colleges left, there would be very little/educa

Bored
The McGill Daily
In large universities there is no reason whatsoever for a person being bored to death; it is only a sign of laziness. 
There are countless activities ... in which university under
graduates may interest themselves and find an outlet for
their enthusiasm which must exist in them.
Sophisticated people, no matter what they may say, 
have feelings like their more native brothers . . . But unfortunately the new lingo and attitude have become acult. 
It is now, in the best circles, indecent to be decent, shame
ful to be shy, offensive to be courteous, suspicious to be simple. The sophisticated even go so far as to. say that 
enthusiasm is a symptom of prolonged adolescence and that to appear bored is maturity.
Why must the young people clothe themselves in this sham and strive to cover up their originality, when it is 
admitted that it is the easiest thing in the world to find life agreeable and to live naturally?

dent Council,, moved rushing season back of mid
semester, shortened it and in general did what 
they could to make it easier for all concerned. It 
was understood that in return the faculty would 
at least try not to ask for too much work. As 
usual the students went under and anyone will 
admit that last weeks assignments were not a bit 
easier or shorter, in fact some departments came 
right out .with quizes to make things nicer. Techs 
rushing system is in need of a total revision. A 
thoro study' sTiould'be made of systems of other 
schools. Many, of them are quite successful com
pared to ours. . .

fraternity by the prospective 
pledges can only be a hurried 
visit.
The principal objection of the 
pledges, according to reports from 
number of participators, is that 
one week is not sufficient time to 
secure advice or consent from 
home and to act judiciously upon 
other details.
The administration and faculty,
on the other hand, have manifested 
whole-hearted approval of the 
shortened season. Scholastic diffi
culties, usually caused by the lack 
of preparation of assignments by 
large groups of students were mini
mized this year, and many instruc
tors were inclined to be lenient 
with such students, when they 
realized the conditions would not 
be prolonged as in previous years.
The complete, list of fraternity 
pledges that have been reported to 
the Tartan will be found at the 
bottom of- this page. The total 
number amounts to 175, as compar
ed with 210 that were listed last
year immediately after the season 
closed.
