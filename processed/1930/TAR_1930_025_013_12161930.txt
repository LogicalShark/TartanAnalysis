The.- annual Ghrishn?.s chapel ser
vice will lake place today at 12:30 
in the Arts Theater. Each year the 
chapel program before the Christmas 
holidays is devoted to the 'singing 
of Chris'.mas carols by the students. 
It is customary for President Baker 
to conduct this chapel but bccausc 
of his absence from Pittsburgh, on 
a European trip, Doctor Watkins will 
preside, at the services. A speaker is 
not .engaged for the occasion be
cause it is felt that the students catr 
gain- the true Christmas spirit by 
singing carols, for thirty 'minutes, of. 
the exercise. The program has. been 
arranged by the music, department 
and a member ,pf .the. department 
will play the ofgan accompaniment 
for the singjtig. 
AH students are invited- to attend 
the service and take part in the' sing
ing. In the past Christmas chapels 
have been largely attended. This year 
there have been few chapel services 
due to the inierference of holidays 
and there is every reason to ex
pect a large attendance at this chapel. 
The program is as follows:

RUSHING RULES UPHELD 
BY PRESENT INTER
FRATERNITY COUNCIL
ROBERT RIPLEY VISITS TARTAN
The Interfraternity Council, act
ing upon the infringement of rush
ing season rules by two , fraterni
ties, has permitted an exception to 
the rule pertaining to the loss of 
the pledge in question. Since the 
pledge is not always at fault, the 
Council has ruled that Delta Tau 
rDelta be penalized but permitted 
to keep their pledges.. Usually the 
pledges are lost by the fraterni
ties.
The Council also moved that 
those fraternities fined must, post 
a new bond before January i5,
1931. Delta Tau Delta will be 
fined $50 for each of -two pledges, 
while Pi Kappa Alpha will be fin
ed for, one pledge, according to 
the Fraternity rushing rules. PhiKapp Psi has also broken the 
rul.es, but the Council will consid
er their case at a later date. 
Rushing rules for next year will 
probably be changed, allowing the 
fraternities to keep their pledge or 
pledges when the rules are broken.
President Merle Smcdberg, hav
ing  attended the National Inter
fraternity Conference which was 
held .in. New York, reported the 
following: 1.; It is generally recom
mended that fraternities cut down 
on Hell Week and substitute a 
probationary period. 2. Scholar
ship is on the rise and in many 
schools the fraternity average is 
above the general average of the 
men. 3. Fraternity obligations 
yield to school obligations and 
there is considerable co-operation

Maggie Murph Freshman Declares
Robot Answers the Man Problem
A Maggie Murph freshman has 
proffered an answer to that much 
debated question, What constitutes 
the ideal man? Here it is:
The robot would eliminate many 
'marital quarrels. There would be 
less exchange of custard pies, furni
ture, or other missiles during little 
^differences. Indeed, why. should an 
irate ^Vife hurl a pic if she would 
have to clean the custard from her 
spouses cars later? A  monkeywrench, directed ; at the wonder's 
mechanistic stomach, would* more 
effectively create peace by shortcircuiting1 the gentleman. Of course, 
wJien a tide of remorse had com
pletely drowned, out the wifes pas
sion, she could get out her tool 
kit, and, by a few deft twists of a 
scrcw-driver and a few love taps 
with a hammer, could produce a 
humble and subdued man. The; 
judicious use of the oil can would 
reduce any protesting groans, 
grunts, squeaks, or other objection
able voices to a. gentle purr. The 
"in-law question would be solved. 
No inquisitive mother-in-law would 
be around to witness the fallen 
cake, or the rubber-like biscuits; 
no'maiden aunts would be .dropping
in to see how matters were coming 
along in the little nest; no pov
erty-stricken relatives -would be on 
hand to share, in the payroll.
Insurance for Mr. Robot w'ould 
be entirely unnecessary.. A "rainy 
day fund which would cover ex
penses for motors and spare parts 
would be sufficient. The ideal man 
would, do as he is bidden, vouch
safing no idle remarks. lie would 
put out the cat and the milk bot
tles at night, and would not com
plain if the cat scratched or if the 
milk bottles fell on his dainty toes. 
This desirable quality would enable 
the wife to indulge in which is 
generally credited to be her favor
ite pastimechattering.
But if all these admirable qual
ities paled in the eyes, of Mrs. 
Robot, she could quite easily junk 
her spouse, and set him out in the 
yard to await the next visit of 
the scrap-and-iron man. Then, 
after relegating him to the Jjack 
pf her mind and labelling him a 
little bit of heaven, she could set 
out on a more turbulent sea of 
matrimony which involved a hus
band with more pesonality, vitality, 
aiid reality.

On his tour of the campus lie was also introduced to the Tartan 
staff and the' above picture'was secured at the publications office.

the Old Gold Cigarette Company and beside, his visit to Carnegie in
cluded public appearances at downtown theaters..  The sponsors of this 
tour were conducting their 'famous blindfold test yesterday on the 
campus, and at various fraternity houses.
DANISH SCHOOL TRIES 
COMPANIONSHIP IDEA
Danish Summer School Open 
to Students From All 
Nations
(NSFA) In 1921 the Interna
tional. Peoples College; Elsinore, 
Denmark,' was -founded as a sum
mer school for students of all na
tions. The purpose of the school 
is to instruct in the ways and cus
toms of various nations, for, ac
cording. to John R; Barton, (perma
nent: professor at the college, 
Jorily by developing a genuine ap
preciation -. and discrimination of 
folk characteristics and national 
traits A:an we be prepared to rise out 
the storms of group feeling when
ever avc fear or suspect the group 
of people who are different. The 
opportunity for' broadening the 
scope of knowledge is . excellent 
here, for 29 nations have been rep
resented in the enrollment.
The school is an outgrowth of 
the . Danish Folk High School 
movement, and retains many of 
the essential features of the sixty 
Danish folk colleges. One of these 
idealsthe companionship of stu
dent with teacheris encouraged 
by the restricted number- of the 
students, usually about one hun
dred at each session.
The curriculum contains such 
subjects as International Relations, 
History, Psychology, and Sociolo
gy;, instruction is giveri~in English, 
German and Danish. In addition 
to a permanent teaching staff, there 
is e/rery year a group of visiting 
lecturers and instructors, men of 
note, from many countries. Sir 
Rabindranath Tagore, Professor H> 
J. Fleur, and Professor Paul 
Passy have recently been among 
this number. " ('Further information 
about .the school may be- obtained 
from John ,R.. Barton, care of the 
Institute of International Educa
tion, 2 West 45th. street, New 
York City.)

Present Conditions Should Be 
Able to Offset De
pression
"There are many reasons for feel
ing certain that good progress will
l.tt' madc-in business cf all kinds be
fore manjf months have4 passed, 
stated E. M. Herr, vice-chairman of 
the Westinghousc Electric arid Manu
facturing Company, in an address of 
"Progress which he delivered before 
a meeting of the Mid-day Club held 
at Springfield, 111.
"With a splendid record of indus
trial progress just behind us, said 
Mr. Iicrr, with out banks arid other 
financial institutions in a very strong 
position, with the largest supply of 
gold in the world, with our inven
tories at a low figure, and with! our 
credit and transportation facilities in 
splendid condition for efficient scrviGe, no one can doubt that the 
present depression in business, will 
soon be over and that still greater 
progress is before us.
The business world has been driv
ing ahead at too fast arid reckless 
a pace, according to Mr. Herr. The 
past decade of prosperity in this coun
try was ,duc to the industrial 
paralysis of Europe following the 
war, but Europe has now sufficiently 
recovered to resume her proper place 
in the world of coiijmcrcc arid in
dustry, and .as a result we find- our
selves compelled to adjust ourselves 
to new conditions of restricted de
mand. Largely on this account, we 
arc now passing through a cycle of 
business depression.
FearS that the use of labor-sav
ing machinery will reduce wages and 
increase unemployment are* ground
less, said . Mr. Herr. On the con
trary, the more labor-saving ma
chinery there is, the more* work there 
will be for people willing and able 
to work. He quoted U. S. Census 
figures to show that a worker of 
today, aided by machinery, is doing 
work done by three men in 1899, and 
is -receiving wages of - all three; and 
.that, in spite of this increased pro
ductivity and compensation, a greater 
percentage of ouij population is need
ed to provide goods and services

Clarication of the Count 
As a Penalty for Absence
Numerous reports as to a 
change in the regulations con
cerning the penalty known as a

the actual provisions.
A count is incurred in two 
ways, either as a result of an 
uncxcrcised absence before or 
after the vacation periods of 
Thanksgiving, Christmas or Eas
ter, or in special eases a count 
may be used as a disciplinary 
measure by the faculty. In 
either case -there . is no fine 
connected with the penalty.
The large number of persons 
receiving counts as a result of 
uncxcused absence at Thanks-,

Chenkin, Dramatic 
Impersonator, At 
Music Hall, Dec. 18
Talented Russian Famous 
For Performance as 
Singing Actor
The talented ^Russian, Victor 
Chenkin, who is coming to Carnegie 
Music Hall on December 18, is' 
unique among foreign artiste who 
have invaded the American theater, 
for he had practically, recreated the 
difficult role of the singing actor. 
He gives life to a superb group of 
characters, familiar to varios cor
ners of Continental EurOpe, making 
eaclr character the voice of the folk 
ljorc of an ancient'people and deal
ing in drhniatie t mood rather than 
dramatic inci.dent. , i ,,
Chchkiiv is,' abo'vC till,- an actor. 
Without an innate knowledge of 
the . dramatic, craft, lie could never 
ive .reality to his varied im'pefson* 
ations, nor .extend tjiat reality into 
th illusion of setting and support
ing cast. But his singing voice is 
by no means to be overlooked. A 
flexible organ, lie easily bends it 
to his, will, whether he requires 
the 'sonorous intonations 'of the 
Jewish rabbi singing the laments 
of his people, the liquid tones of 
the Italian boy, or the crii'dc, earth
ly'voice-of the kranian peasant. 
If lie appears in five changes of 
costtipe, he is; five different per
sons, and each personality is' in 
kturn assumed or shed with the 
garments that represent- it, for each 
new garb means an inner'as well 
as an outer' transformation. ..Arid, 
even -though they do not know the 
language, the audience understands 
him perfectly -through his remark
able, mimicry and graceful gestures.
Chenkins rcital is sponsored by 
the Art Concert Bureau, and the 
,Manager, S. Ashkcnzy, announces 
that the tickets are priced from 75c 
to $2.50, and are one sale at 
Hirschs Book Store and Schiffs 
Music Shop. It is .a rare opportun
ity, and one that music-lovers will 
avail themselves ; of, for hearing 
him is secondi best to a trip around 
the world. <
But the subtlest effect he achiev
ed is -through: the medium of  his 
strangely expressive* hands, and if 
it were possible to black out the 
entire stage, training lights only 
on his gesticulating hands, the 
audience would still see a draniatic 
.performance. A series of varying

M. M. C. C. Dress Designers Give
Fashion Display of New Frocks
Costumes from Ldlong, Vionnet, 
Augustabernard, Chanel, Lanvin, 
and other famous Parisian dress 
designers appeared Monday in the 
Blue Room of Margaret Morrison. 
That, is) they appeared by proxy. 
There is no higher tribute than 
imitation, and the senior girls in 
the Costume Economics Depart
ment paid this tribute to these 
reat designers by adapting noted 
models for personal use.
However, do not give too much 
credit to the Parisian couturiers 
for the finished loveliness of the 
evening dresses our .own girls 
made. Suppose a tall, thin young 
lady chooses a Vionnet pattern of 
Grecian simplicity, with long, flowliries of clinging satinthis 
young'lady must alter the pattern 
to fit her own focm, so that she 
doesnt look like , a, draped pole 
instead of a human person; she 
must soften and widen the lines 
this is just , one of the; many'prob
lems she must solve. Neither can 
. short, s'.out girl who needs a 
itrenuous e:ghteen-day diet. ' ke, in 
fc  &...
toto, a Chanel model of white lace 
and satin, all ruffled and billowy 
from waist to ankle. She would be 
the proverbial "fleecy white cloud 
with none of -the distinct outlines 
that are necessary in the mpdern 
mode.' '
These girls again proved them
selves .wise by working out the 
model they chose in a cheap ma

the setting for the next production 
of the Drama Department, aefcording' ..to the Rev. Mr. Barnabas 
Dicnes, author and director of 
Two Checks To Slap, which will 
be produced in the Little Theater . 
about January 13.
Suppose, Mr. Dicnes says, "a 
man should turn up in Pittsburgh 
who realizes how much misery 
there is in the world and wants to 
make existence better for them, 
lie .tries to love people. The play 
then tells what liappen's to him, 
when lie is a steel worker and 
wli.cn he is owner of a mill. His 
final solution is the,last scene of 
the play.
Mr. Dicnes is a graduate student 
with the , Drarna Department, and 
is personally directing his play 
which was written in the dramatic 
composition class of Mr. Chester B; 
Wallace. lie has been ' writing 
plays as long as he can remember, 
practically, so he tells, ever since 
he knew what a phi}' was. He was 
born in Hungary and studied in a 
number of cities in Europe. Even 
then, he was acting in and produc
ing plays, both as a part of his 
work and for pleasure, xlis favorite 
plays were from the works of 
Maeterlinck, Ibsen, and Paul Clau
del. At the outbreak of the World 
War, lie was a student in Paris; 
and lived in the artist colony vof 
Raymond' Duncan, the brother of, 
the famous dancer Isidore Duncan.
Merely because of nationality, 
he was made a civil prisoner of 
war three weeks before hostilities 
really began. He, with his friends, 
was shipped, away ninety miles from 
Paris to K small town where Mr.. 
'Dicnes said, for a month, in com
parison to what followed, life was 
idyllic. Then came -the march on 
the Marne and immediately, the 
.prisoners wefc sent to the south of 
Francei to live in an abandoned 
leper hospital. Life here, was a 
nightmare. On arrival, they were 
each given straw to sleep on, noth
ing riio're than dry bread to cat, 
and small picccs of soap as 'the 
only vestige of cleanliness. Gypsies 
from everywhere, professors, street 
walkers of Paris, Students, a- motley 
crowd' of human beings from all 
walks of life Were all brought to
gether in a space 74 feet long and12 feet wide, surrounded'.by a pal
ing fence, barbed wire, and guarded 
by soldiers withi fixed bayoriets,. 
Fevers broke out and life was one 
sordid depression. Four months 
Were spent in this miserable place,

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTAN
ALUMNI NEWS
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1930.
A TEAM, composed of what a group of Carnegies veteran 
griddcrs consider their best opponents during the past season, 
includes players from six of nine rival teams. The selection, 
although made by those who arc in a position to know by ex
perience, docs not tally with the All-American team in some 
choices, nor with all individual opinions. It must be remem
bered, however, that the standings are rated in particular on 
the showings made against the Tartans, and in that view, the 
opponents named are entirely worthy of being considered an 
All-Opponents team. The line-up consists of McNcal of W. and 
J., left end; Marec of Georgia Tech, left tackle; Leonard of 
Thiel, left guard; Daugherty of Pitt, center; Metzger of Notre' 
Dame, right guard; Jesse Quatse of Pitt, right tackle; Jerry 
Nemeck of N. Y. U., right end; Carideo (of course) of Notre 
Dame, quarter; Schwartz of Notre Dame, left half; McNamara 
Df N. Y. U., right half; and Savoldi of Notre Dame, fullback.
FROM ALL' INDICATIONS, the piebe basketeers will 
have another good year. Baldy Buckley, who has been assist
ing Coach Hogan in priming the yearlings, has given them a 
blocking defense which works unusually well even against the 
varsity. Bueks quintette will open January 10 
with the Johnstown Junior College in the local gym. 
Other teams carded include Kiski, W. and J. FreshJi men, Pitt Freshmen, Geneva College Reserves, 
 Shadysidc Academy, West Virginia Frcshmcn> and 
[the Penn State Freshmen.
Although the new cage material this year/is outstanding, the 
Combination that will finally be called the team now lacks ex
perience. By the close of the season, hwevcr, Buck will have 
a squad ready to step into varsity shoes for the 32 season.
LOOKING AHEAD A BIT, we find that the CarnegieW. and J. track meet, to be held at Washington, May 9, comes 
on the Saturday of the fraternity sweepstake finals. Unless 
some re-arrangement is made, many of the best pushers will 
necessarily be absent, and the buggy races will not be repre
sentative of the competing fraternities.
It is evident that one of the schedules should be changed, 
and since the sweepstakes must come during the time set aside 
on the official school calendar for the Spring Carnival, it would 
seem logical to card the track meet for some other time if 
possible.
EYTIi HAS BEEN SELECTED to play on ai* all-star 
baseball team during Christmas vacation* Dutch will play as, 
an infielder on Lcs Gages College Humor team which is 
scheduled for two games in the West Indies during the 
holidays. And after a taste of the diamond and what not, ivc 
expect to sec him in one of the new basketball uniforms.
TWO MORE CARNEGIE PLAYERS have been chosen 
to compete in post-season games.1 John Karcis and Pete 
Flanagan have been invited by Jack McBride, former Syracuse 
fullback, to play on his all-star Northern team in the NorthSouth Charity game at the Yankee Stadium, December 27.
Tl\l> ROSENZWE1G AGAIN MAKES "THE ,LIME
LIGHT in the Alf-Amerlcan selections. Ted received an 
hononible mention as end by. the Rockne-A'V.'irner-AlexanderJones foursome. During his sophomore yeitr, he was also in
cluded in the All-American Boards selection.'
Not to change the, subject, or talk behind his .back, but we 
heard that he has his wardrobe all: set to harmonize with the 
movie star fashions. You know, lie is on his way to Frisco 
right now to play in the All East-All West game December 27.
Varsity And Plebe | Varsiiy Track Schedule
Swimmers Prepare Announced; Cincinnati 
For Coming Season University Newcomer
With a good many weeks of practicc behind them, Carnegies repre
sentation in the swimming world is 
rounding into a shape that will prove 
to be a dangerous obstacle in the 
way of all opponents. Coach Allen 
Risedorph reports the squad in good 
shape, but at this time any predic
tions for the coming meets are some
what of a mystery which is partly 
to be unraveled by the mid-year 
grades.
Mondays practice meet climaxed 
the training season for this year. In 
January, the boys will be hard at it 
again to absorb the finishing touches' 
for the opening of the campaign. 
Assignments for places on the varsity 
and freshman teams are still in 
doubt ar.d further trial meets are 
scheduled to bring out the cream of 
the crop.
Carnegies second annual Inter
scholastic Relay Swimming Meet will 
take place March 28, 1931. Announce
ments have been sent to seventy 
schools and, judging from the inter
est shown last year, the entry list 
will include about fifty schools.
The Plcbes have responded with 
a squad that is probal.ly superior 
to any former ones. They have a 
large variety of good splashers who 
can give the varsity a merry chase. 
In February, the freshmen will open 
their season which includes meets 
with Langley High, Schenley High, 
Taylor Aldcrdice High, South Hills 
High, Academy High of Erie, Uni
versity School of Cleveland, and Pitt 
Frosh. The Plebes will remain at 
Jaome for all meets with the excep
tion of the dual with the University 
' School at Cleveland.
The varsity card reads:
February 13, F. & M. at Lancaster, 
Pa.; February 14, University of; Dela
ware at Newark; February 20, W. 
& J. at Pittsburgh; February 25, 
Pitt at Carnegie; February 28, West
ern Reserve at Pittsburgh.
March 6, W. & J. at Washing
ton, Pa.; March 7, Case at Pitts
burgh; March 14, University of Cin
cinnati at Cincinna.',
Six-dual meets have been sched
uled for the 1931 Carnegie track 
and field lean), making one of the 
stillest schedules the cinder pound
ers have yet attempted. Three of 
the meets arc to be held at the 
Bowl, while the squad will make 
short trips to Washington, Pa., 
and Grove City to compete in 'two 
others, with the Pitt meet at the 
Stadium to round out the sched
ule. The only newcomer on the 
card is the University of Cincin
nati about which little Is known.
In view of the good season the 
squad experienced last year, and 
the very few losses by graduation, 
the team should make one of the 
best records of any Carnegie track 
team.
The -track events should present 
a tower of strength for the Plaid. 
In the sprints, George Noase, 
present holder of the schools quarter-mile record, will find keen 
competition in the 100 and 220 
events in Sigmund, of last years 
Plebe'outfit.1 In the quarter, Nease 
will also find stiff opposition in 
another sophomore, To'm. Coulter, 
last years yearling captain. In
cluded in the list ..of events in 
which ho shines aro the two hurdle 
races, the school time for which 
he is cxpcctcd to eclipse , during 
the coming season. "Phil Magnuson will be on hand to take care 
of the half-mile race,,' which is all 
that need be said about'that event, 
In the mile and two-mile races, 
the team suffered its greatest loss 
by graduation, in "Don" Shafer. 
Jess Price, present holder of the 
schools cross-country record, will 
probably hold sway in the ^twomile event, while Ramsey, one of 
the outstanding sophomores, is 
ahead in the anile. 
The field events are as full of 
ifs as ever. If Armentrout and 
Karcis are out, the team will ba 
considerably strengthened in the 
weight events. John is one of the 
best discus men the school has 
had in some years, and would unTARTAN CAGERS TO

Six New Opponents In
cluded Among Nine
teen on Card
While the students of old Car
negie arc at, home enjoying a big 
Christmas dinner and playing Santa 
Claus to their kid brother*; and sis
ters, the basketball team will be in 
the gymnasium 'eating up their pre
liminary practice sessions in prepara
tion of the opening game with the 
Youngstown Y. M. C. A.
The first game oi flic season is 
at Youngstown the day after Christ
mas. From every indication, the Car
negie five should repeat their vic
tory of last year, not that the game 
will be a sfct up, blit that the Plaid 
team will be in excellent shape for 
the opening game. After the Youngs
town game, the squad will journey ti> 
Buffalo to meet the fast University 
of Buffalo Quintette. The Carnegie 
Quintette will then go to Cleveland 
to match their wares against the 
strong Western Reserve outfit; West
ern Reserve has already decisively 
defeated Pitt this year. Returning 
home from their road trip, the team 
will cncomUer the five from Lehigh 
University, who arc making a tour of 
Western Pennsylvania, playing Pitt, 
DuqUcsnc and several other schools.
The Plaid squad should be in good 
condition to meet all their foes. 
They have been practicing faithfully 
since the middle of October and in 
the last two weeks have been round
ing into good form under the coach
ing of "Buzz Hogan. The team has 
played a number of practice games 
so fare and has been Victorious in all 
of them. The last practice game was 
Friday with the Plebe team. Tl)e 
varsity in the last half showed un
expected strength and won 51-19. The 
line-up for the opening game is in 
doubt. Coach Hogan has been experi
menting with several Combinations 
and1 is undecidcd oil his opening line
up. However, the one he seems to 
favor is that of Stcntz at center, 
Captain Nease aiid Bob Smith at 
forward, and the Jimmys.Leonard 
and Fergus at Guards, Others who, 
arc on equal terms with these men 
and wlio will sec plenty of action arc

SHOWN AS CARNEGIE 
INAUGURATES BOXING
Squad of Fifty Works Out 
Under Direction of 
Coach Sesto
doubtcdly add plenty of points to 
the Tartans total. Army, alias 
Big Train" Armctitrout, .is a star 
performer in the shot and hammer 
events, having been a prep school 
record holder in the latter event. 
Ex-captain Spike" Merten should 
continue to pile up points in the 
broad jump and he and Captain 
Ray Barger shohld have things 
their own waj in the pole vault. 
Barger set a new school record -5(1 
this event last spring, which lie 
should equal or better this season.
A number of the men are. work
ing out . consistently :at present, 
but: no organized practices will be 
held for soine time. The season 
gets under way April 25, when 
Western Reserve invades the 
Bowl in an attempt to revenge the 
defeat the Skibos handed them last 
year. This meet is followed by 
one with Cincinnati, which will 
also he held at the bowl. The 
next Saturday, the boys will break
away from the May Carnival for a 
meet with W. & J. at Little Wash
ington. The final meet at the 
Bowl comes May 16, when the 
Gchcvians will furnish the opposi
tion. The dual meet season comes 
to an end the following week with 
the annual Pitt meet at the Sta
dium, Wednesday, and a trip to 
Grove City to ring down the cur
tain Saturday 22.
Carnegie will enter the collegiate 
boxing ranks this year for the first 
time' in the history of-the school. 
The boxers, about fifty in number, 
have been practicing almost un
noticed during the last month, but 
with the opening of the season, 
they will undoubtedly attract con
siderable' attention. Coach Sesto, 
Olympic champion at 125 pounds, 
has been obtained , to coach the 
'squad. It is evident from the w^y 
in which he handles the aspirants 
that Carnegie will have a surprise 
in store for its fans, So'sto has 
been connected' with the Pitts
burgh Lyceum anti holds a title 
equivalent to the world's amateur 
championship.
Boxing at Carnegie will no doubt 
appeal more. to the men than the 
women of the school in that it is 
a one-man sport. The contenders 
have but one opponent at a time, 
and receive more individual atten
tion than is usually accordcd team 
players.
Reports from the office of the 
Graduate' Manager indicate that in
terest in the coming sport is uncxpcctcdly keen. The schedule has 
not yet been completed, but it is 
hoped that the majority of the 
scraps will take place in the gym.
The squad was strengthened 
last week by the appcarancc of 
Alex (Duke) Ducanis, who is in 
fine shape from football training. 
In the few workouts he has attend
ed thus far, Duke looks like a 
real find. He is an old-time mitslingcr from Bellefontc who has 
the tricks already in his gloves. 
At present lie weighs in at 170, but 
it is expected that he will enter 
the ring at 175.
Burke is another old-timer who 
is good at demolishing beaks and 
ringing eyes. He has been partici
pating- in amateur bouts in. this, 
section throughout the season and 
has won most of them .by. the 
knockout rbute. '
Other candidates who look like 
tough customers in their weights 
are King, Ashe, Mike Rcstaine, 
Fred Lang, Emil Affcttranger; 
Tom Waldron and John Kelley.
The water bucket, towels, ban
dages, and raw steaks arc capably 
handled by one . S. J.  (Billy). Tauriello and another, William Clinediust, both of whom have had pre
vious experience in repairing ec
centric snoots and closed eyes.
No definite schedule has yet 
been arranged, but it is hoped that 
it will be announced soon. Coach 
Sesto also hopes to classify and 
possibly cut , the squad .within a 
few days.

Womens Athletics
Tehnis
Dorothy Anderson and Maxine 
Pickarski secured the womens 
doubles championship by defeating 
Maybcllc Steele and Eleanor Lemon 
in a hard-fought match. It was 
necessary to play three sets to 
determi'nc the winner; the set 
scores were 5-7, 6-3, and 10-8. Due, 
to the unfavorable weather conditi6n the final match was played in 
the womens gym. This was a 
great handicap to the players as the 
side and back walls arc very , close 
to the court line. Much Credit 
must be given to these fotir play
ers in continuing the match to 
the end.
Swimming
Forty women, mostly Margaret 
Morrison freshmen and sophomores, 
report regularly on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays at 12:30 in the pool for 
sw'imming practices. These prac
tices are conducted under the per
sonnel supervision of Miss Russell 
and Miss Konich, the womens gym 
instructors,
Mary Jane Grey, W. A. A. swim
ming manager, urges more stu
dents to attend these practices. As 
there have been only .five practices 
so far, and since the season con
tinues until March, it is not too 
late to begin. It is necessary to 
attend one-half the total number 
of practices to make the team. To 
those who are eligible for the. team, 
100 W. A. A. points arc given, 
Those who attend one-half of the 
practices receive 50 points, while 
75 points are awarded to those at
tending thrce-foUrths of the prac
tices.
The season is concluded with a 
swimming meet between M. M. 
C, C. class teams and the Arts 
school team. Throughout the year, 
various stunts arc being taught at 
the swimming practices; those 
stunts will be an interesting feature 
of the aquatic meet which will be 
held about March 1.
According to a regulation made 
by the W. A. A. Board, swimming 
practiccs may be substituted for 
shimming classes with the consent 
of Miss Russell and Miss Konrich. 
This concession should be of in
terest to all the girls.

Just as I expectedwe could 
lardlv go through a season without 
v.2 proverbial accident on the 
campus. The other evening I hap
pened along in time to near bom
bastic expostulation of words, the 
occasion nf which was obvious. You 
see it was jirt.like this. /e learn 
that two bodies cannot occupy the 
sanie space at the same time, night 
engineering students notwithstand
ing; the result was presto 
smash. Either somebody has poor 
eyesightor else this somebody is 
. so engrossed within himself that 
only he, himself, counts. The driver 
who did the hitti-g was, entirely in 
the wrong as usUal, rUshing pell 
mcll, without a care for the other 
fellow, and lie admitted too that 
he did it. "He couldnt see, or 
sjme such silly remark was the re
tort to the injured partys remon
strance. The argument waxed high 
until one of "Pittsburghs Own 
came u; n the scene and threaten
ed to make an arrest, whereupon 
the culprit started to color under 
the "gills. How did I see this 
change take place? Well, I am a 
night student, and have trained my 
eyesight accordingly. A suggestion 
to this night student who did the 
.hitting ishave your eyes examjined; passing this test, resolve that 
jmaybe the other fellow has some 5/ights too, and that you' will put 
into practice some of the theories 
ftvhich you have learned at night in 
Engineering.
Yes, I was at the Night Arts 
Dance and did enjoy myself? Well 
;yoU should have been there, that 
is providing you are a night art 
student. We surely did have the 
ime of our lives/ Those horns 
ftVcijt over big as did the balloons 
and' everything. Ill take my hat 
off to the committee. Im ready 
right now for the sccond affair.
Lat'eiy, I have missed the "Book 
Reviewof what the Night Arts 
are reading, it is lfard for me to 
keep track of ,this group if I don't 
get a report once in a While, i I 
also notice, that "Didja Notice has 
gone on a ] r-.longcd vacation or 
solnetliing of the like. The elusive 
personality has certainly given us 
the slip, or it may be ! it possibly 
she is saving up for a renewal after 
the holidays. Once in a while r. 
little let up seems, to be just the 
thing needed to get a new start 
and that, perhaps, may be the oc
casion of our extended vacation 
period. Yes, it is a little longer 
tliAh usual, because it. staV.'.s on the 
18th of December, and ends on 
'Monday, January;. 5th at 6:30 p. m. 
when all classes beginfor thb new 
year,
Wonder how the change of loca^ 
tion of .the downtown library branch 
is meeting the needs of its patrons. 
Some day I am going in to the 
Union Trust Building -- and look 
.the place over. Maybe they will 
have the sort of books I like to 
read in my spare time. YoU know, 
if I havent told you before, that 
I have a-lot of spare , time and I 
endeavor to use this to good ad
vantage. . Classes begin, at 7:00 p. 
m. r-ost of the time. in Arts* and 
la. until 10:00 p. m., and maybe 
longer, who knows, So .by the time 
the equipment is. put away it is 
half-after tlie hour, and then yOU 
start o-' your happy way home 
across the "Cut to one of Pitts
burghs famous "pack erds winch 
come along at intervals of un
determined length. You are lucky 
to get one and maybe by 11:30 or 
12 m'dnight you are entrenched 
within the;- portals of your own 
home ready for a couple of hours 
of study so that you can safely 
say that you burn the proverbial 
Midnight oil.
WellChristmas.. is just around 
the corner" from us now and it 
seems to be one grand scramble 
to know what to buy this one and 
that one. I "don't, I just close my 
eyes and pick the first thing I see. 
However, be that as it may, and all 
jokes aside, this is the time for the 
exchange of. good wishes, and jrour 
Idle Night Student wishes to ex press ihis feeling to  ail on the

of the greetings. Until we meet 
again next yearMerry Christmas!
POST-HOLIDAY DANCE 
TO BE HELD JANUARY 10
The Post Holiday Dance will be 
the next social offering of the 
Night Student Council. 'T'his dance 
will be held on January 10, the 
first affair to be scheduled in the 
new year, in the Mens Gymnasium.
During the Christmas Recess 
period the committee in charge will 
organise a program for the occa
sion which, judging from the prev
ious activities of thj^ group, prom
ise.; to be successful. At this time 
the orchestra has not been engaged 
but one will be secured which will 
compare favorably with any which 
has appeared on the campus.
Tickets will be sent out during 
the recess period to the workers 
for distribution. The price of a 
ticket is $1.00 per couple and when 
one compares what the Night Stu
dent Council gives for this low 
price with otlict- functions it is no 
wonder they have such a large 
turnout.
All the workers are expected to 
be on hand in the afternoon ofJanuary 10 when they-will be as
signed to the various operations 
Which arc necessary for the dance.
This is the only announcement 
which can be made. before the 
dance as the next issue of the Tar
tan will not appear until January 
13. So keep the date in mind and. 
plan to attend this function..

DECEMBER MEETING
, A,t the December. meeting of the 
Night Student Council a letter was 
read front Dr. Ilirig advising that 
the request .which the Council had 
made for. change of hours of the 
hook store-room had - been grantedv 
Notice of this change has been pub
lished in the Tartan.
Tlie tabled motion to repeal a 
By-Law effecting eligibility to Coun
cil was lost by a majority vote of 
council. *Thc President of each col
lege was given the r.atnes of those 
students who had expressed a will
ingness to support the Council. These 
night students would be given an 
opportunity to work;
Information w.^s /requested as to 
the formation of a night basketball 
team. A connnitke was-"appointed- to 
investigate the possibilities of this 
question.
The Council ;asscd a motion 
officially recognizing.Nu Sigma Alpha 
Fraternity as the Night Activities

CHRISTMAS RECESS
The night studcwlr. Christmas 
Recess will commence Wednesday 
evening, December 17 at 10:30 
oclock and will continue until Mon
day evening January 5 at 6:30 
oclock when classes will resume.
In the "blood and thunder section 
of one ofr-thc local newspapers re
cently an article describing the last 
will' and testament of a welUto-do 
westerner., appeared Who, it Would 
seem, was a confirme.1, if self-styled, 
woman hater.
Among many of the provisions of 
tile will, including the late lamenteds 
reasbns J'or disliking the -weaker (?) 
sex, was a. bequest to the people of. 
the town wherein he lived. This be
quest was a library; not public, as 
usual, but open- to men only.
The will stated in very exact 
language that women Would ; at no 
time be permitted to associate' them
selves . with* the library, either as 
patrons, or assistants; On the face of 
the matter, the bequest looks queer, 
especially since the building is not 
to be started for a long time, speci
fied in the will.
Deeper down, however, the "womanlcss library is not only queerit 
is absurd. The donor fails to realize 
that while books written by women 
can easily be excluded, it will be all 
but impossible to find books, parts 
of which, at least, have not been 
made by women who arc employed 
in almost every book binding and 
printing shop in the world. This fact 
alone removes all. hope of a posi
tively unfeminine library.
With this thought in mind, it is 
hard to take the balance of the 
statements and bequests- seriously, 
and it seems only just that the rela
tives of the deceased should at
tempt to break the will on grounds 
which are only too apparent.

HOLIDAYS
We are now in the midst of the 
holiday season which, strange as 
it may seem, comes about this 
time every year. It is that time of 
the year when every one of us arc 
about ready io throw everything 
pertaining to our studies into the 
ash can for a while and take a 
little vacation. Its great to have 
a little respite from our tedious 
task of pursuing an education. If 
you arc behind in your studies 
and have been having trouble in 
meeting your assignments, the 
Christmas recess is just the oppor
tunity that you -need to catch up 
and to prepare for the mid-year 
exams, which come a few weeks 
after the first of the new year.
Thanksgiving has come and 
gone and with it went many tur
keys, pumpkin pics, cranberries and 
other victuals which help to make 
a thanksgiving dinner what it 
ought to be. Of course no one 
could write about this day without 
some mention of the Night Stu
dent Council, Thanksgiving Recess 
dance which was held the evening 
after the annihilation of turkey. 
What an, affair that dance turned 
out to be. The most . successful 
social function ever sponsored by 
that organization was voted the 
best ever by the several hundred 
couples who attended. Last year 
the Council moved over to the 
gym to hold their dances because 
the Union was not large enough to 
accommodate the growing attend
ance at these affairs and, if the 
dances continue to grow, it looks 
like the Council will soon be rent
ing Motor Square Garden or some 
other large hall in which to hold 
their future dances.
According to the official sched
ule in the little rfed handbook, 
Christmas recess begins immedi
ately after classes on the evening 
of December 17 and continues Un
til Monday evening, January 5. 
The Night Social calendar' shows 
the next Council dance to follow 
on January 10, so there are plenty 
of good times and recreational pe
riods coming in the next month or 
so and' its up to us to make the 
best of them.

THE LINDSAY-MANNING 
AFFAIR
After . being forcibly ejeited from 
the cathedral of St. John the Divine 
in New York City, Judge Lindsey, 
ex-jurist from the wild and wooly 
wCst, has been contemplating a 
damage suit against Bishop Manning. 
The regrettable affair was caused by 
the Judge taking spontaneous objec
tion to a sermon the Bishop Was 
giving on the subject of companion
ate marriage.
It is truly unfortunate that the in
cident occurred, and little reason can 
be found for the fracas. Both Bishop 
Manning and Judge Lindsey arc Well 
known for their grasp on current and 
contemporary happenings and theor
ies, and both have their supporters, 
cac!i set of which will claim that an 
injustice has been done to their 
favorite.'
The Judge, -even though incensed 
by parts of the scrmoti, should have 
realized that a cathedral is certainly 
not the place for an open discus
sion, especially such a spontaneous 
one as it promised to become.
^vcn though one does not agree 
with another's views, he should re
spect the dignity attached to an ec
clesiastical building.
The ejection of the Judge was the 
only momentary solution of the 
quandaiy, and the refusal of the 
Bishop to answer from the pulpit 
speaks well for his self-control and 
desire to preserve the .dignity of his 
position.

CHRISTMAS AND HOME
Christmas tiu*
Christmas Tide is here once again and with it 
comes that almost indescribable feeling of good fel
lowship and good cheer. Our thoughts are turned from 
the everyday things of life to those of a different 
plane, unconsciously, no doubt, but nevertheless true. 
Everything about us seems to be animated by a spirit 
of love and happiness. We pause and contemplate 
upon the things of this life and what they mean. We 
ask ourselves, have we done something worth while 
have we made life any easier for our fellow beings?
Imbibed with this spirit of friendliness and good 
cheer The Plaid Staff" wishes to take this occasion to 
express a feeling of goodwill to all the student body, 
night and day, to the members of the faculty, and to 
those of the Administration. May your Christmas be 
a very merry one, and the New Year hold for you 
health, happiness, and good cheer.
STANDARD TIMES 
BIRTHDAY
November 18 was the forty-seventh 
anniversary of the institution of 
standard time zones which have 
greatly simplified the railroads prob
lem of correlating the times used in 
the various districts wherein sta
tions arc located. Before the stand
ardization took place, every town of 
any considerable size determined its 
own time from meridian observation.
Prior to the advent of the rail
road, this difference in time between 
nearby points was inconsequential, 
but .after this' mode of transportation 
made general travel possible, coiir 
sidcrablc confusion resulted. The 
railroads did their best to obtain 
order from chaos by taking the time 
of certain large cities on their lines 
as standards for nearby stations on 
the line.
However, it was not until 1S83 
that the members of the general rail
road time convention decided upon 
the * introduction of standard time. 
NaluraUy, business. men and others 
who found it ncccssary -to travel a 
great deal were impressed, and the' 
change-was adopted.
The convention decided to let cer
tain meridians .of longitude de
termine the location of definite belts, 
all points in each belt to have the 
same time standard. The meridians 
chosen to define the time zones were 
the sixtieth, seventy-fifth, ninetieth, 
one-hundred and fifth, and one-hun
dred and twentieth west of Green
wich, England. The time in cach 
successive belt determined by these 
lines arc four, five, six, seven and 
eight hours respectively slower, than 
Greenwich time.
East of the sixtieth^ meridian, the 
standard is called Colonial Time, 
and the others in order are respec
tively Eastern, Central,. Mountain and 
Pacific time.
The simplicity and effectiveness of 
the system enabled the, public . to 
adopt it without delay or confusion, 
and the plan has been in effective 
operation since.

NIGHT ARTS DANCE
GREAT SUCCESS
The first dance of tlie season to 
be given by the Night College of 
Fine Arts Was held oil December 
6 in the Union. A large turnout 
was on hand to celebrate the occa
sion;
The colorful decorations com* 
bined with  the wonderful music 
furnished by tlie Venetian Screnad* 
ers added to the enjoyment of the 
dancers. The climax of the eve
ning came when the balloons, 
Which served As decorations, were 
lowered. A scramble started' and 
it was' thoroughly enjoyed by all 
those present. Succeeding this, fa
vors Were passed out consisting of 
various types of noise makers. 
The excitement and din became so 
great that even the orchestra could 
not be heard at times. Finally the 
novelty of the affair quieted down 
and the dance went om All too 
soon, as it always does, the strains 
of the last dance were heard clos
ing one more successful affair giv
en by the Night Arts.
The committee which had ar
ranged this dance is ,to be con
gratulated for the successful work. 
It wa^ evident that they under
stood and knew how to satisfy the 
demands of the dancers* a critical 
body at that, because eVcry feature 
was attended to. And here is a 
little secret: This committee has
promised something new and dif
ferent for you at the next Arts

Potts have said that during the

nearest to what liis Cr.cator tUcant

his neighbors and how they May be 
made more happy. Selfishness 
scehis to diminish or entirely dis
appear. We begin to think of tlie 
yearS gone by and of the timis 
we were warned to be good or 
Santa" wouldn't come. These 
memories become mofc precious 
as time slips by and We think of 
home tnore often.

"Home aint a place that gold call

Not only the rich are happy blit

than Was needed 30 years ago. 
Furthermore, machine-prodUction has 
decreased the relative cost of manu
factured products and therefore has 
helped to raise our standards of 
living.
But notwithstanding the progress 
made in the betterment of working 
and living conditions, we do have 
periods of great unemployment,1* con
tinued Mr. Herr. "This is generally 
due to violent changes in industrial 
and commercial conditions which can 
not be quickly adjusted, and Until 
they arc adjusted, production in nearly 
every line must slow up, During such 
periods, both government and indus
try should endeavor to furnish em
ployment by speeding up work which 
might, under normal conditions, be 
delayed.
 Great progress is also to be seen 
in our railroad development, tlie in
crease in the use of electricity, for 
power, the electrification " of ' our 
farms, in the extension of our use 
of telephone, automobiles, and, 
especially, the spread of higher edu
cation.
"Those of us who have been for 
many active years in business have 
passed through similar pdriods ot 
depression and know that they do 
dome to an end and are followed 
by good times. Because of our pro
gress, such periods arc less severe 
and destructive than they formerly 
were and tend also to be of short

Merry Christmas and the Depression
Another year has passed, and it is time once moVe for 
everyone'to get the feeling of that Yuletide spirit. ^Always, at 
xthis season it is customary and appropriate to remember those 
who lare less fortunate, and most people take some-time, from 
their merrymaking to give assistance where it is needed.
This year,, more than ever, is the need for such activity 
felt'. .So much has already been said on this score that it is 
perhaps unnecessary for us to mention it. It is impossible to 
pick up a.magazine or newspaper, to~atterid the theater, or even 
to walk the downtown streets withput being constantly re
minded of what is commonly termed, the -depression. It is, in
deed, so widespread that many students have to think no further 
than of themselves in order to realize the condition. Christmas, 
it appears, will not be the same'for them either this year.
To the majority of people at Carnegie, however, Christmas 
will go on as usual, and it is therti that we wish tp remind that 
merry Christmas is shadowed for many by the depression. It 
is not hard to find some way to help. There are so many ways 
that the difficulty probaT51y lies in knowing which one to 
choose.- In selecting any one of the more. familiar ways you 
are making no mistake and. the more of them that you are able 
to include the better.
We do-not? wish to overshadow the holidays with a feeling 
of depression-cbnsciousness, nor do we wish te arouse in the 
more fortunate a feeling of guilt. If, however, you find it neces
sary to cut'your Christmas budget this year, dont let the cut 
come , from that portion/of it that was formerly dedicated to 
those .who .otherwise cant have quite such a^rrierry Christmas.
PLAY REVIEW
; There was once a would-be novel
ist who wrote a novel or two. He 
callcd them The Dubliners, and A 
Portrait of the Author.' Both were 
utter failures, and the explanation 
Was simply that he lacked the na
tural ability to be an author. But 
he-was clever. He was also, it seems, 
a personal showman, ' and a good 
psychologist. So he compiled a book 
full of words, some sufficiently ob
scene,. Which' he called Ulysses. 
When it came out, it was a. puzzle. 
No one could understand it;, but, 
of course, no' oiic said so. If they 
admitted incomprehension, others 
might think them lacking in aesthetic 
taste. Si they called it safely, an 
urbane product of genius. Thus, 
suddenly, the world neard, of a 
James Joyce, a name' now of inter
national fame.
In the other arts, the same clever-, 
ness has been repeated. In poetry 
with, the imagists, in music with the 
jazz-classicists, and in painting with 
the modernists. In the drama
Last Tuesday night The Far Prin
cess of Rostand ,was produced con1 
, structivistically at the .ittlc Theater. 
It was not a play, but an experi
ment. And as an experiment it was 
a bore, thus contradicting its every 
excuse for'being. It was a Pi'rric 
victory; for the actors, and a dis
mal failure as a" production. As a 
result it was ^either one thing nor 
another. One felt cheated, for hav
ing come at.all.
If this is constructivism as prac
ticed by Meierhold of Russiathe 
only place where true constructivism 
can ever mean anything if on - under
stands the reasons for its origin 
then the textbooks by men who 
know, are wrong. For the affair be
ing perpetrated at the Little Theater 
is not re^l constructivisfh. True, it 
does have some of the elements of 
constructivism, but that doesnt make 
it so. It has no right to the name. 
Three quarts of water' and a: quart
of milk dontj make a gallon of milk 
any day in thp week.
Constructivistic acting calls for 
stylization. But in The Far Prin
cess -jt was not evident. Instead 
there were writhings and contortions, 
brcast-heavings and staring eyes, all 
strdngly reminiscent of the old-time 
foreign pictures we used to see years 
ago. It was nothing less than' old, in
flated Continental acting which never 
needed inflation, heaven knows! 
Glagolm is a Russian and Russia is 
on the continent.* Was he once an 
actor? :
And the diction. The least said the 
better. Leave it with one question 
and \a comment. Where were the 
perfectly understandable - voices of 
The Faithful and "The Wild 
Duck? Perhaps in this brand of 
constructivism intelligibility is not 
necessary.
In' summary* someone some where 
is having -his leg. pulled. Who is it? 
It may . be the audience, and again 
it may not. At least, it cant be all 
of the..audience, for some of them 
have heard about' the would-be novel
ist who once wrote .two novels. He 
called them The--Dubliners and A 
Portrait of.the Author. Both were 
failures, and the explanation ....

Its easy to see that Christmas 
is almost upon, us, with the co-eds 
smiling sweeter than ever, with 
the boys around the campus be
ginning to cool gradually N toward 
their numerous girl friends,, and 
with Betty Steele writing composi
tions, or rather themes, oh Wfi^t 
Santa Claus would do if he should 
come to Pitt.sburgh. We person
ally cant see why Santa Claus 
would even consider Pittsburgh, 
with places like Cleveland and 
Poughkeepsie to go to, but maybe 
even he is fooled.
It wont be long now before 
the popular girls of the campus 
will add to their collections of 
fraternity bracelets, necklaces, etc., 
new trophies of the hunt. Fraterfiity brothers probably will re
ceive lots of ties as presents this 
year after the visits made to to 
Carnegie fraternities by that un
usual tie .salesman last week. A 
quantity of his products greeted 
the campus Wednesday morning. 
When you can buy six presents 
for $1.50, its not such a bad 
Christmas  after all.

Among the greatest^ benefits to

"There was a time not so long 
ago, when parents had an undis
puted place in a well-ordered 
world. They were regarded as 
highly necessary and as wise and 
experienced enough to take a large 
share in the general education of 
their children. In the American 
horrte parents usually had complete 
control; they knew what was what 
and there was no one to reason 
why. Their - ine'thods of bringing 
up their offspring may have been 
rough and ready, but they were 
effective. This was, of course, in 
the . days before the American 
home came under suspicion of be
ing a mere filling station.
An old and much discussed ques
tion is "What shall be done for 
the nations children? However, 
ins his article "The Wayward Par
ent Brought to Book" in the New 
York Times , Magazine of Novem
ber 30, 1930, Mr. George H. Cope
land turns to a new query, "What 
Shall be done for the nations 
parents? The situation described 
in the paragraph quoted above has 
vanished, but with no gradual 
let-down. The change occurred 
suddenly with the onset of "the 
feminist movement, the World war, 
the new education, and the many 
mechanical contraptions to change 
home life. The,parcnt .disappear
ed from the home and was as 
completely out of it as he had' 
been in it' before.
"Such a situation, of course, 
could not last. It was too easy; 
parents must be brought back to 
the fold, if by the scruff of the 
neck. The psychologists, child 
^experts and new educators took 
hold and decided that parents must 
learn more about their jobs. They 
niust go to school again. They 
must be. re-educated ' to educate 
their children; they must' be 
brought up to bring up their chil
dren properly. And now the,well 
brought up parent, learns his p'-; 
and q's in lectures, summer schools, 
correspondence courses, even 
through listening to radio talks.
. Study has shown that the 
causes 'for faults in the children 
are remarkably often accountable 
for by behavior traits of the par
ents. Parents are very slowly re
turning to that picture which they 
so suddenly left, but with a very
different Attitude, "It lilay be that, 
the tendency of parents to take a 
back scat in the bringing up of 
their youngsters is partly due to 
an inferiority complex, a feeling 
that modcrtv schooling is beyond 
them. Father gasps when Johnny, 
aged 6, tells the name of practipally .every mptor car that passes 
along the streets, and explains the 
inside workings of the ' postoffice, 
museums and' railroad terminals. 
He is stunned, however, to see 
ho\v little the small boy may
k-now of the regulation three Rs, 
and lie recalls that when lie was 
about that age he had to stay after 
school and write, the Word whis
pering 300 times. Johnny is nev
er bothered with whispering In 
any form. His communications 
arc never "sotto voce.
But the business of bringing up 
parents is still in the experimental 
stage, and the forming of "do"
and don't rules for them is, a 
difficult task. The more it is 
studied, the more situations arc 
found that do not seem to come
under any rule. For there seem
to be as many problems in bring
ing up children as there arc chil
dren, as . many parcnt-'problems as 
there are parents. And as for the 
number of , pitrcnt-children-problemsthat is a matter for higher 
mathematics.

will appear January 13, 1931.

each were favored. These were to 
be based on a natural, unrestricted 
grouping, a veritable Utopia o' 
collegiate democracy. Students are 
to be required to live in such dbiA 
mitorics for at least the freshman 
and sophomore years. Just where 
the third and fourth years were to 
be spent, received, no commcnt, 
but if wc had our our owil choice 
we would vote for' small private, 
apartments, absolutely unrestricted 
by the university authorities. De
spite much- talk-'to the  contrary, 
the vast majority of questionnaires'" 
favored the continuance of the -fra
ternity system; ' wWv
Here, 'hoNvtyer; there was con
siderable argument, sonic favoring 
fraternities " building and . running 
their own houses; others believing 
that u n i ( o r m \accommodations 
should be.. furnished each fraterni
ty by the university as .part of; its 
dormitory system; and .still others 
desiring to-do away with fraternity 
houses, restrict these organizations 
to small chapter rooms with 'jlio 
living accommodations. .
Student activities: at siicji a uni
versity, - should include a  well-balanced  (program of ihtercollegible 
and intramural athletics with as 
much emphasis on the latter as on 
the former;- and a reasonably pro
portioned distribution of other lic-j 
tivitics ^uc.h as-' debating, jourital-j 
ism, .art) and imisic. Tlic bene-i 
lits of ,student . managership j of]
undcrgraduiite tictivities were c6n-' 
sidercd sufficient to be worth re-j 
taming despite the many political

The great dam of the Walerville Development
The Wa I er vi 11<* Development
mdre hydro-electric power 
for the South
How dynami tc was used 
in the construction of 
this great project
T
ub Carolina Power and .Light 
Coinpnny needed more electric 
power to serve llie territory in,which 
it operutoH. The rcBiilt wan the 
Waterville Development ... a vHt 
hydro electric project located in the 
Croat Smoky Mountains.
The actual working of this projcct 
involved the erection of a constant 
arch dam, jfl.'l feet high . . . three 
tunnelfl varying in length from 5,000 
to 16,000 feet . . . three penstock 
tunnels 600 feet in length ... a verti 
cal shaft known as a gap shaft . . . 
and a surge tank ahaft.
From the Walerville Development, 
transminHion lines carry the current 
to many pointB in Carolina and 
Tennessee. The tremendous power 
of the Great SmokicB serves to turn
the wheels of industry and light the 
. homes of thousands of people of the 
South.
Such a development woidrl not 
have been possible without the nee ot 
dynamite. Du Pont explosives were 
used for all blasting operations.
The engineer of tomorrow needs to 
know all there, is to know about 
dynamite . . . tho toot that helps 
to build skyserapers, bridges, dams, 
subways, tunnels, roads and railroads.
How can you know more . . . now 
*. . . while youre still in college? 
Write the du Pont Company for a 
copy of the "Blasters Handbook. 
This booklet contains a wealth of 
information about explosives ... in  
formation1 gathered iu twenty-eight 
' years' experience in making and im
proving explosives. It is compact 
. . . handy. It is used in tho class
rooms of leading technical institu
tions. Your free copy is waiting for 
you. Write for it.
