Results of^rtanfHnor Roll Snry.ey
The results of a': surrey of Honor-Boll stu
dents conducted by the Tartan during tbe sum
mer shows that the average student should 
practice the following rules of study if he 
would get the most benefit out of his course 
at Carnegie. The percentages quoted show 
how- the voting was divided on every question*.
1. Systematically review the textbook 
. and notes before final exams and quizzes.
97%; .
2. Spend the night before a final exam 
in study rather than relaxation. 53%.
3. Systematically review the textbook 
when facts previously learned are needed. 
81%.
4 Read over an assignment rapidly to 
get a general idea of the authors treat
ment and then study in dctaiL 65%.
5. As you read keep notes in some sys
tematic way, such as in a notebook. 61%.
6.. Budget your time for each subject, 
and follow a fairly definite study sched
ule. 72%.
7. Explain problems and processes for 
other students when there is an opportu
nity to do so. 9S%.
S. If you do not understand how to 
proceed in solving a problem, try to reason 
out tbe procedure rather than looking up 
the solution of other problems. 83%.
9. In general check each problem by 
reworking it after it is completed. 52%.
10. Cheek each operation in a problem 
as it is performed. 68%.
11. Bead the textbook relative to the 
subject matter of a laboratory experiment 
before doing the experiment. 90%.
32. "When doing an experiment, read 
through and try to understand all the di
rections before beginning to work; do not 
merely read the directions as the experi
ment progresses. 93%.
By the indicated percentages the following 
study habits whrefi are often recommended to 
students were voted a waste of time or other
wise not applicable to the subjects taught at 
Carnegie:13. Systematically review the textbook 
daily or at least weekly. 69%.
14. After studying an assignment recite
the lesson to yourself, either alond or in a 
whisper. 76%._______________________________
15. After studying an assignment write ' 
out a summary r outline of the matrial 
read. 57%.
16. ..'Write up experiments in the labor
atory with the equipment all set up, rather 
than taking notes and results of the experi
ment and : writing., up the experiment at. 
home. 69%.
' A large number of students recommended 
tbe following study rules as being worth while 
and valuabie :
17. Make an effort to really concen
trate while studying. Some students sug
gested keeping tab with a watch to see 
that one does not Say dream too much in
stead of studying.
13. Do your work as it is assigned, 
since it is dangerous to fall behind, even
for ti day.
Get plenty of sleep on .week day 
nights and before quizzes since grades at 
Carnegie are based entirely on the stu
dent's ability to think efficiently and 
quickly during quiz periods.
20. Do your own work, both daily as
signments and laboratory reports.
Tbe following habits were suggested by i 
smaller number of students:
21. Study assignments on the same day 
they are assigned. ,
2. Be sure to ask the instructor either 
in class or afterwards about any point 
which is not dear. .
23. Listen intelligently and attentively 
in the classroom, and make the notes as 
complete as possible.
26. Cultivate broad reading habits 
along the line of your course and if possi
ble on world problems.
27. Study, discn&s, and compare notes 
with a classmate of your own ability.
28. Go over each evening the notes 
taken that day, checking for mistakes.
29. Have a regular place to study 
where you will not be interruptedespec
ially by the radio.
30. If a student- has real trouble with a 
subject even though be studies hard it is 
probably because he does not understand 
its relation to his course. He should make 
every effort to find out why the subject 
was included in his curriculum and' then 
try to et. at the real heart of the subject.

BY JERRY HANSONwi/n\
Ing last, the iron sky-pie seasons football opener staff certainly picked the right kind of weather for the initial appeal ance of its eccentric head-gear, for the day reminded one of dear old*. London town.
! BUT WHETHER THE WEATHER is to be blamed for the showing the Carnegie grid machine made, or didnt make, in the Jilt with the Coventers, rests in the hands of the censors. It is true the Geneva field T?as in miserable shape, and it took only a couple of minutes of play to find the members of each team well covered with mud. But both fwpnis were under the same handicap, so it is doubtful that Llie condition of the field may be held responsible for the failure of the Skibos to show the -widely-touted edge they were expected to have over the team coached by Dyke Beede. Incidentally, Beede is a former Plaid star, like Harpster, and is al60 coaching a former Harpster team.
DESPITE CURRENT REPORTS that the goal-gaining play early in th< second quarter of the Carnegle-Geneva game was a premeditated trick, It was undoubtedly a fluke.  It appeared to be a well-executed play, since It was so nearly perfect and so very effective. . However, credit Is due only for the exercise of some very decent football h< was exhibited by the players directly responsible.' Sputzy" Terebus, who played like a Trojan throughout the first half, was unable liver a pass safely to any elegible man, so he cut down the side As in a miracle, he emerged from'a mass of Geneva players Into the open field. And then the long run for the goal line. Sputzy*' was clever In picking and getting through the hole, but it was due 0 the teams one perfect exhibition of blocking that the path to the goal was made possible.' George Goodrldge was the man on the job, for he neatly blocked two on-coming Covenanters at the kernel of the excitement, thus providing the key for the miraculous exit. Mlhm. and Lewis were prominent In the defensive, Mihms long spirals taking the Sklbo aggregation out of a number of tight situations. The complaint which was voiced most by the members of the team themselves was that there was an extreme lack of co-operation among the clan players, which factor has been the means of ruining many an otherwise first rate ball club of the past.
brand of ball. The Geneva threat was wrapped entirely within this man, and he -was the'mairi spring of almost all of the oppositions successful plays. Though injured twice during the game, he stuck the fight out valiantly to the last. Johnson played in the fullback position. Rather interesting testimony to the merit of the Geneva corpp is the fact that Beede did not order a single'substitution throughout the entire game. This situation was contrary'to the usual Beede program of heretofore, and in the gan_______ . ___y. the Covenanter freahnvarsity contests.
WHAT REALLY CHEERED OUR SPIRITS and made the day a cc ful success was the appearance of the Kiltie Band.
