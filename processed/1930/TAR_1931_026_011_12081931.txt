FELLOWS CHOOSE 
RESEARCH TOPICS
Dr. V. Krivobok Directs Graduate Students In Investigation
Extensive research programs arc 
being conducted by graduate stu
dents .in the Metallurgical and Min
ing Departments on a variety of 
technical subjects which include the 
study of special'- steels, coal by
products, slag systems, and other 
materials of commercial importance.
Altogether there are ten investi
gators who hold fellowships in the 
Mining and Metallurgical Depart
ments. These , men,  who were se
lected from a list of 60 applicants, 
have chosen their research topics 
from the general subjects of the 
chemistry of coal and coal prod
ucts, coal mining and preparation, 
and ferrous mctallurgj'.
Under the direction of Dr. V. N. 
Krivobok, professor in, the Depart
ment of Metallurgy; Philip Daily, 
Miles. Smith, and Roy Tindula arc 
studying' rus't-rcsistirig steels. Tri 
their investigation these men arc 
giving special attention to the gain
ing of a much needed scientific 
knowledge of the substances pre
sent in certain steels which make 
them immune to the attacks of 
oxygen. Mr. Daily is a graduate 
of Purdue University, Mr. Tindula 
graduated from Oregon State Col
lege in. 1,929, while Mr. Smith rcccivcd his B.S. degree from Grove 
City College and his M.S. degree 
from Carnegie Tech.
Seven of the research fellows are 
working at their problems at the 
United States. Bureau of Mines 
Station on Forbes street. James 
Clclland, a graduate of Grove City 
College, is studying "The Stand
ardization of the Agglutinating Test 
for Coal. Walter Kembcl, who 
received his B.S. degree from Wash-, 
ington >Statc College, is investigat
ing The Occluded Gases in Coal. 
The Effects of Electrical and Mag
netic Fields on Flame Propagation" 
is the- research topic of Clarence 
Kreutz, a graduate of the Univer
sity of Denver.
Robert Smith, who was graduated 
by Lehigh University,- has selected 
for his research topics The Com
position of Low Temperature Tar 
and The Stability of Symmetrical 
Xylenol. Herbert Strickler, a 
Carnegie Tech graduate, is conduct
ing an examination of The Chem

STATEMENT OF 
HOLIDAY CUTS
Alan Bright States Views 
Of Various College 
Penalties
ABSENCES INCREASE
Executive Board May Use 
Count System For 
Next Year
Unless the class attendance im
proves at the Christmas and Easter 
holiday periods there is likelihood 
that Carnegie will return to the 
count, as a penalty for cuts before 
and after holidays. The. absence re
ported at the Thanksgiving holiday 
period indicated a 50 per cent jncrease over the absence reported at 
the corresponding period of last 
year.
The  absences will be reported 
throughout the present year at the 
holiday periods arid at the end of 
the year a decision will be reached 
as to whether or not the extent of 
such absence demands that a penalty 
be again imposed. By action'of the 
Executive Board the awarding of 
counts for these absences was dis
continued for the year 1931-32. 
Hitherto one count was given for 
each uncxcuscd absence at holidaj' 
periods. Upon receiving a third 
count the rccorcl of the student was 
reviewed by the Discipline committee 
and lie was subject to being either 
expelled or suspended.
At most, American colleges and uni
versities the matter of class attend
ance at holiday periods has presented 
a serious problem. A review of the 
methods used to rid the problem 
shows that penalties of all forms arc 
imposed. Some use financial assess
ment, others the lowering of grade 
and the reduction of the amount of 
credit for the work 6f the semester, 
and still others by excluding the stu
dents from the final examinations, or 
compelling them to drop the sub
ject.

Seriously Speaking
A Column of Curious Comment
By NATHAN MILLER
Vaudeville or Justice
The most irresponsible scenariowriter or screen director could 
hardly have devised a more out
landish situation than that which 
transpired in San Francisco last 
week. Iiis Honor, the dapper, 
scintillating and wise-cracking James 
T. Walker, Mayor of New York, 
pleading for the embittered and 
prison-ridden victim of class jus
tice, Tom Moonoy!
For fifteen years, Mooney has 
been incarcerated in San Quentin 
prison and has aroused ceaseless 
efforts of organizations to expunge 
this blot upon our judicial ways 
and erase another cause celebrc. 
For*fifteen months or more there 
has also arisen a determined effort 
to oust the playboy Mayor of New 
York from his high office. In fact, 
an investigating committee is now 
hot on Walkers trail in the exami
nation of the mischievous conduct 
of his position.
The country has greeted the 
Mayors trek to California with 
amazement. Naturally, one seeks 
motives for an act of this. sort. 
Undoubtedly, since Walker is noted 
for political shrewfdness, it is not 
beyond reason, to suppose that he 
seeks to restore political favor 
through this gigantic publicity 
stunt to overcome unsavory revela
tions which arc promised at home. 
The yield in publicity ("that most 
precious -commodity of modern 
4-imes) will be enormous.
Still, if Walker is successful in 
freeing Mooney, undoubtedly much 
will be (and has already) been for
given him. But the implications 
will be devastating; that injustice 
can only be retrieved by sentimen
tal, Hollywood stage setting and 
stunts. Political and social rights 
mean less than ballyhoo and tearjerking. And for the years that 
Mooney lias lost we offer the con
solation only that a brilliant clown 
gave him the key to his freedom 
(if he gets it).
Many Carnegie Students Vote In
College Disarmament Poll
In connection with the student poll which is being taken at col
leges throughout the country by the Intercollegiate Disarmament 
Council, four hundred Carnegie men and women voted recently on 
several phases of national defense, disarmament, and World Court 
attitude. Ballots were passed in economics and commercial law classes 
in the college of engineering, and in economics classes in Margaret 
Morrison. A total of 356 men and 41 women voted. The results ob
tained from the ballots are tabulated as follows:
I. If all nations join in similar reductions in military and naval 
establishments intended for use against each other, how much 
disarmament would you favor? (Check the approximate figure 
desired).
75%74; 100%106. 
delegation to the General Disarminitiative in calling upon all nations

III. Do you favor our setting an example for other nations by re
ducing our expenditures upon; armaments?

IV. Do you favor American adherence to the World Court upon the 
basis of the Root Protocols?

V. Do you favor compulsory military training in colleges?
Yes68 No337.
VI. Do 3rou favor' dropping military training entirely from the col
lege curriculum?
Yes83 No310.
Although only a small percentage, approximately 12%) voted, a 
fairly comprehensive view can be obtained from the ballots of these 
few, as several different classes and courses are represented. Of the 
356 men who voted 230 are sophomores, 6*1 juniors and 9 freshmen. 
Of the women, 39 are juniors and .5 seniors.
More detailed results of the poll proved to be informative and 
rather surprising. As a'whole, the group is equally divided between 
50% or 100% disarmament, with the understanding that all nations

dents enter .Carnegie until they 
graduate, how the Bureau looks 
after them as alumni, and how the 
department keeps in touch with 
them for the rest of their lives, 
thus recording information which 
can be used for the guidance of 
future graduates.
The blanks which will be given 
to the seniors at this . meeting 
should be filled out as carcfully as 
possible so that intelligent employ
ment leads may be furnished. The 
pcrsonal-history information which 
one of these blanks obtains is

DR.MILLER WORKS 
ON ENCYCLOPEDIA
Will Review H. G. Wells Latest Book For Periodical
Dr. Nathan Miller, of the Depart
ment of Economics of the College of 
Industries and Margaret Morrison, 
accomplished many achievements while 
on. his leave of abscnce during the 
school year 1930-1931. His editorial 
work for the Encj'clopcdia of Social 
Scicnccs, which was performed in the 
company of about fifty students in 
various fields, involved close contact 
with modern literature in the realms 
of Economics, Political Science, Law 
and Anthropology.
In preparing' material to be pub
lished in the Encyclopedia, which 
appears every four months, Dr. Miller 
and his associates first compiled a 
digest or outline of each topic. Men 
eminent in their respective fields 
contributed. When the manuscripts 
had been received they were edited 
severely before publication, not only 
for their literary form and content 
but for their adequacy to the sub
ject, and for the bibliography em
ployed.
Dr. Millers work was principally 
in the fields , of the history of re
ligion, and 'in anthropology, most of 
which was done in the Columbia 
University Library, and tjie - Public 
Library of New York City.
Two prominent men with whom 
Dr. Miller worked during the sum
mer are Dr. E. R. A. Scligmann 
of Columbia University, who is 
Editor-in-Chicf of the Encyclopedia, 
and Robert Briffault, an English
writer, who has to his .literary
credit The Mothers, a scientific
and historical book.
For an early issue of the Sat
urday Review of Literature, Dr. 
Miller is at present reviewing Ii. 
G. Wells latest book, entitled
.The Work, Wealth and Happiness 
of Mankind. This book contains 
about one thousand pages, being 
nearly as large as the "Outline, 
aiid is well illustrated. The date 
of publication is November 23; Dr. 
Millers article, which,will be more 
or less in . the form of an essay, 
containing some synopsis, but prin
cipally comments, will appear soon 
afterwards. ^This work is parallel 
to his work for "The Encyclope
dia in that it covers approximately 
the same scope of work. ,
Besides this review, Dr. Miller 
has written Initiation, which will 
appear in the Encyclopedia, Vol
ume 7, early in 1932. He will 
hive an-article entitled "Birth Con
trol in Primitive Society in The 
Birth Control Review appearing 
soon; and The European Heritage 
of the American Family for the 
next number of the Annals of the 
American Academy of Political and 
Social Sciences wrhich will appear 
in the spring.
New Student Directory Reveals
Many Amusing Name Groupings
Titles, Professions; Geographical Locations, And 
Colors Found In Name List Of Students 
Enrolled At Carnegie
The new directory is out again 
and from Abel to Zubritsky the 
name, address and telephone num
ber of each student of the Institute 
are listed alphabetically.
As usual, these names reveal a 
startling number of similarity and 
groupings that produce some inter
esting results.
The Smiths, numbering twenty, 
lead the field, with eighteen Da
vises running a close second.
If you see Black, Green, Brown, 
Gray, Rose and Scarlet in front 
of your eyes dont blame it on 
last nights party. We hav.e lots of 
them on our campus.
Speaking of titles, lets bow to 
our King, Prince, Marquis, Lord, 
Eric, Knight and Kaiser.
It seems as if men of other pro
fessions are turning to Engineer
ing and Arts. Looking over the 
list tve see that we have a Painter, 
Plummer, Stoker, Carpenter, But
ler, Cook, Porter, Miller, Fisher, 
Taylor, Barber, Baker and a Weav
er. The depression sure is on!
But .we also have our presidents
in: Grant, Buchannan, Jackson, Lin
coln, Munroe, Taft, Wilson and 
Hoover. Re-incarnation?
Or would you rather have a 
writer? A two cent stamp sends 
you one of these: Hardy, Holmes, 
Hart, Burns, Cooper and Gold
smith.
In fact,- we have all sizes of 
people: Long, Lyttle, Broad and 
Stout. Take your pick.
If the museum is in need of any 
specimens we can supply them 
with a Wolf, Fox, Lyon, Fish and 
Swan.
If. you arc planning to take a 
vacation, consider the following 
places first:
Paris', Milano, Glasgow, Boston, 
Babylon, Reading, Richmond, Kent 
or Wooster. We assure you ex
cellent scrvice on our liners. Or 
should you prefer an automobile 
we are at your service with a 
Ford, Hudson, Maxwell or Studcbaker. We stop ON all railroad 
crossings.

ARRANGING FORMAL
Intermural B a s k e t b all 
Will Begin Soon After 
Christmas
At is meeting last Wednesday 
evening, the Interfratcrnity Council 
made a few additions and correc
tions to {he rushing rules which 
arc to govern the rushing season 
which opened last Saturday morn
ing.
The silent period, which was to 
terminate at 10 a. m. Sunday, De
cember 13, will now continue until 
l-p.Vm. on the same date. How
ever, freshman may accept bids any 
time after 10 a. m.
The ruling which called for the 
loss of the pledge in question for 
the period of one year in the case 
of an infraction of the rushing 
rules was also changed. The new 
ruling states that the fraternity 
may keep the man, but that it

in order to eliminate ambiguity, 
also ruled' that the only time that 
fraternity men will be allowed to 
be with freshmen off campus is on

Guild Announces 
Holiday Activities
The Carnegie Tech Guild, under 
the leadership of Dorothy Carey, 
Guild president, and Miss Meyer, 
faculty adviser, has begun definite 
plans for its Christmas charitable 
activities.
Although all arrangements have 
not been completed, it seems prob
able that about $40 will be given 
to the poor by the Guild this year. 
Carnegies philanthropic organiza
tion will  give to poor families, 
whose financial conditions and gen
uine want have been reliably 
vouched for, either the provision of 
milk for several months, several 
dollars each in cash, or relief in 
any of a number of ways, depend
ing on the particular ease of each 
family. It is uncertain whether or 
not clothing will be among the 
donations this year.
The money donation will pro
vide the families, with the oppor
tunity for doing their own Christ
mas buying, all donations taking 
the place of Christmas baskets, 
which will not be given this year.
Both Dean Green and Miss 
Meyer, instructor in the Depart
ment of Social Work, arc co-oper
ating with the Guild in forming 
plans for the Christmas season. 
Definite arrangements will be made 
at a meeting to be held by the 
Guild this week.

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, DECEMBER' 8, 1931.TA R TA N SPORTS PAGE
CARNEGIES ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION staged tHcir annual graduation cxcrciscs for the 1931 football squad at the 
P. A. A. last Saturday night, The interest of the evening centered about Hook Sample and George Kavel who were 
appointed co-captains of the next Plaid team by Coaches Steffen and Waddell. The fine playing of Hook, on the line, and 
George, in the backfield, during the past two seasons, has certainly warranted .their selection. But above all, they have set a noteworthy example by their clean, hard playing. In wishing 
them the best of luck, we hope their training season begins 
with every candidate on the eligibility list.Further tribute was bestowed upon the Skibo grid squad 
through the speeches of Steffen and Waddell. They both 
agreed that they enjoyed working with their squad more than any other in their history, and with just as much truth we add 
that it was more of a pleasure to watch this squad lose a game 
than to see certain previous ones win.# * * * * *
COACH HOGANS ARRAY of talented basketballers 
ripened the home season with a win over the Y. M. H. A. team. 
A scrappy game was the order of the night, and the Plaid 
players proved themselves more than-equal to the situation. 
A return scrimmage is scheduled on the visitors ildor for 
Thursday night. Tl*c Plebs will warm things up with the 
Y, M. H. A. reserves as a preliminary game.* * * * * ' %
SO MUCH HAS BEEN SAID about the various All 
Mythical football teams that we act in a feeling of self defense 
and of course, with due respect to the efforts of our worthy opponents in the naming of- the Tartan All-Opponent team. 
These players have been chosen for their creditable work in only the games that were on the Plaid schedule. They arc as follows: Center, Miller, Purdue; guards, Hoffman, Notre
Dame, and Firstenburg, New York U.; tackles, Kurth, Notre 
Dame, and Quatse, Pitt; ends, Judd, Temple and Vavra, New York U.; quarterback, Pardonner, Purdue; fullback, Iiecker, 
Purdue; halfbacks, Schwartz, Notre Dame, and Reider, Pitt.

SUMMING UP THE VIEWS of the outside world on 
Carnegies grid play during the past season we find Armen trout, 
Flctcher, Sample and Ducanis receiving honorable mention on 
many of the recognized All-American teams. The following 
schools have selected these Skibo players for their all-opponent 
teams: Pitt, Kavel; W. & J., Armentrout; Temple, Stewart,
Ducanis, Kavel; N. Y. U., Ducanis.* * * * *
JEFF BURKE, one of the bright spots on the Tartan
boxing team, represented Pittsburgh in the International Amateur Boxings tournament at Boston last Monday night. The 
results are too late to print, but were sure that any unlucky 
b(?xer who drew Burke for an opponent was certain to cxpc- ricncfc three rounds of genuine boxing. Jeff is in that one 
hundred sixty pound class where they hit hard and work fast.Coach Sesto has offprcd the services of his most promising 
jnit-mcn for the .Charity exhibition matches to be held at the Motor Square Garden on Friday night. The squad has bccii progressing in good shape, and they will probably indulge in a 
few more pre-season bouts before the regular schedule begins.

THE I. D. B. L. OF THE C. I. T., or the more com
monly known intra-mural basketball scramble will be discussed 
at a meeting' of the team managers this .afternoon in the 
Trophy .Room. A schedule must be arranged, and competition 
is expected to begin during January.

CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNERS added the finishing touches to a fairly successful season when they elected General Grant 
Wilbur Ramsey to captain the 1032 team. His consistent traveling over the six-mile course made him number two man on 
the harrier squad. Ramsey also runs the mile for the track team.
But after all, the generals demotion to the ranks of a 
captain is a wise move, for we arc told, a captain sees more action than a general anyway.

STATISTICAL PROOF THAT THE GOLF BUG about 
Carnegie has evidently died of starvation was obtained last 
week. It now remains for a healthy post-mortem to revive any 
thoughts of a team in the future.
Three replies from the request for scores were received. 
These candidates would be a benefit to any mans golf team, 
but it requires many more than three to make up an entire team. * * * * * *
DUQUESNES FOOTBALL ANTICS of. last Saturday meant as much to them as a victory, but we must fall back 
on the figures and facts surrounding the case to get the slightest 
bit of satisfaction. The Plaid team resembled a powerful machine that was stuck in the mud, while the Dukes showed a line that held when nedessary.
A puzzling point occurred when the ball left Kavels arms and sailed past the end zone. Since he was not over the goal
line and no Duquesne player touched the oval, then a touch-back was scored which brought no points to Carnegie.
Rie Squads Continue To
Pump Lead Into Targets
Carnegies rifle team is in full 
swing. The varsity schedule hasnt 
5)cen completely formed as yet, but 
it should be ready for the next is
sue of the Tartan.
Coach Sommers will hold ' two 
placement matches, one for the 
varsity and one freshman. The 
varsitys placement match will be 
in three positions: prone, kneel
ing and standing. The freshmens 
match will be shot in prone posi
tion. These placements determine 
the ranking of the' men on the 
two squads.
A few notes of importance arc 
ihat nine new rifles have been 
added to the squads artillery; 
Hudson and Irons have shot the 
possible prone scores; Center and
Hudson are thoroughly enjoying 
their job of coaching the girls 
rifle squad.

four newcomers filling in the string 
of opponents. Instead of opening 
up with Buffalo, as was the ease,

Western Reserve, Washington Uni

Probably .one disappointment of

Dukes Line Holds
Under the amazed eyes of over 
40,000 frenzied football fans the Du-, 
qucsnc eleven held the Carnegie' ma
chine to a 0-0 tic last Saturday in 
one of the most succcssfnl charity 
games ever to be held. Five times 
the Plaid pushed down the field to 
the BluiTmcns twenty yard line only 
to lose the ball on downs. Time 
after time the Carnegie backs slashed 
through tackle, or around end for 
nice gains, only to be held when 
they neared the Dukes goal. The 
old punch, which so oftentimes this 
season was displayed when in the 
enemics territory, was decidedly 
lacking and directly resulted in their 
inability to put the ball over.
The Duquesne eleven came in the 
game with nothing to lose and 
everything to gain, and were primed 
and set for every Tartan attack. 
Their vicious tackling was a point 
in their favor tliroughout the game, 
and every; gain made through rhclr 
set line .was rough going.
The Carnegie line, on tit? other 
hand, played a brilliant defensive 
game and the yards gained through 
them were extremely scarce. Only 
once during the entire game were 
the Hluffmcn able to go beyond lltcir 
35-yard line, and that was late, in 
the last quarter when a long pass 
netted them one of their few first 
downs and put the ball on their own 
40-yard line.
PLEBES FACE
BIG SCHEDULE
The Plcbe eagers are rapidly 
polishing up for a heavy schedule 
of sixteen games, with the official 
opener slated for January 6. George 
Ncasc, star forward and captain of 
Carnegies fine team of last year, 
has taken over the coaching posi
tion and reports that his team is 
in good condition.
Coach Ncasc has fourteen men 
on his roster, all with considerable 
experience from prop school play
ing. The guards arc Riggs, of 
Pittsburgh; McCalman, of Pitts
burgh; Stitt, of Pittsburgh; Mihni, 
of Pittsburgh, and Goodridgc of 
Washington,, Pa. Contenders for 
forward positions arc MJcLcnahan, 
of Pittsburgh; Carlson of James

Notre Dame, and Dubin, from New 
Jersey. The centers arc Ewalt; of 
Pittsburgh; Sharp, of Lorrain, and 
Latimore, of New -Jersey.

Sample And Kavel 
Named Co-Captains 
By Steffen, Waddell
At the annual Carnegie football 
banquet held at the P. A. A. Sat
urday night, William E. ("Hooks) 
Sample of Middletown, Ohio, and 
George Kavel of Irwin, Pa., wereelected co-captains of 1932 team. 
Sample, a guard, who is one of 
the mainstays of the Tartan line, 
and Kavel, outstanding running 
back of this season, have both 
seen two years of varsity service. 
Both surprised the fans by making 
the first string their sophomore 
year, a season during which the 
amount of- available veteran ma
terial was unusually plentiful.
Judge Steffen, head coach, indi
cated that lie was going to retire, 
but had not yet arrived at a def
inite decision. Among the other 
speakers were Al Irwin,'Dr. Marks 
and Clarence Ovcrcnd.
Those awarded letters arc Armentrout, Fletcher, Ducanis, Bcvevino, Forsman, Ostrosky, Sample, 
Kavel, Ducgcr, OToole, Stewart, 
Drcshcr, EWing, Potts; Pounccy, 
Jones, Heinzcr, Vorderbtirg, Gravcno, Kcbc, Lewis, Ziglcr and 
Trcon. t
see much action during this 
season. Riggs hails from South 
Hills High; Ewalt flayed on the 
II. U. Hoyle team, and McLcnahan 
conics from Schcnley .High. Carl
son, Goodridgc, Mihm and Stitt 
have just finished the season on 
the Plcbe football team. Pre-sea
son estimates point to another suc
cessful year for yearlings, and the 
Plcbcs arc cxpcctcd to turn in a 
record to comparc with last years, 
and at the same time keep pace 
with the showing the varsity is cx
pcctcd to make.
TARTAN CAGERS 
DEFEAT Y.M.H.A. 
IN FIRST GAME
Piiid Team To Play 
Return Engagement 
On Thursday
In the first basketball of the pres
ent season last Tuesday the Carnegie 
Tech team decisively defeated the 
strong Y. M. H. A. quintet by the 
score of 36-15 The visitors, although 
they put up a stiff fight, were unable 
to gain much headway against 
Jimmy Leonard and his team-mates. 
This being the first game of the 
year the offensive work of the Tar
tans was not as smooth as might 
be looked for later in the season, 
but the defensive play was very good. 
So well were the opposing players 
guarded, that they were unable to 
score in the first seven minutes of 
the second half.
Jim Fergus, the stellar guard from 
last year, was out of the !inc-up be
cause of illness, but he will be in 
shape fdr the first collcge game on 
December 17. The-opening lineup for 
the Plaid team consisted of Jagnow 
and Smith at the forwards, Stentz 
at center and Capt. Jimmy Leonard 
and Radabaugh at the guards.
Tn the preliminary game the Y. M. 
Ii. A. reserves defeated the Carnegie 
Tech reserves by the scorc of 17-13.
Practice Game Dec. 10
The Carnegie Tech team has one 
more practice game before they begin 
their regular schedule. It is a re
turn game with the Y. M. II. A. on 
December 10. The freshman team 
will play their first game at this 
time with the Y. M. Ii. A. re
serves.
The first regular game of the sea
son is with the strong Kentucky 
Wesleyan team on December 17. It 
is tire first of a 26 game schedule 
which includes some of the strongest 
teams in the country. During Christ
mas vacation the Plaid 'outfit plays 
six games. After the first game they 
play the University of Kenutckj1, on 
December 18, and the St. Xavier 
of Cincinnati .on December 20.
On December 27 one of the most 
attractive games of the season will 
be played in the Carnegie Gymn 
when the Tartans meet Albic Booth 
and his cohorts from Yale. Then on 
January 1 the Slcibos journey to 
Buffalo tj meet the University of 
Buffalo team and the next day they 
encounter the, University of Chicago 
quintet in Chicago,
Team Must Improve
In order to make a good showing 
in the first games Coach Hogan has 
his work cut out for him. Although 
the ...team played good ball in the 
first practice game they , lack some 
co-oi'dination ajid team work which 
can be added only by practice. But 
with two weeks to go .the coach 
should be able to iron out these 
minor faults and have his team, on 
edge fdr the first game. With a 
26 game schedule the team will have 
to be kept on edge, week in and 
week out, during the whole season 
because there will be no chance for 
a let up.

ALUMNI URGED TO 
MAKE DOLLAR DAY 
CONTRIBUTION SOON
More than 60 additional contri
butions, have been reported to the 
Endowment Fund, as the Dollar 
Day Drive enters its. third week. 
The total is not as large as usual, 
however, so that it is hoped that 
all alumni will make an especial 
effort not only to contribute but 
also to interest their friends and 
friends of Carnegie.
Nearly four million dollars needs 
to be raised within the next 12 
years, if Carnegie is to take ad
vantage of the "2 for 1 plan 
whereby the Carnegie Foundation 
will give $2 for every one raised 
by the school. The alumni have 
a definite share in this project, and 
it is hoped that through the annual 
Dollar Day Drive a considerable 
sum can be raised.

tributed this year are: James F.

Problem: how to answer a 
million a day
Users of Bell System service ask Informa
tion more than 1,000,000 questions every 
day. Providing facilities for answering them 
promptly, correctly, was one problem put up 
to engineers of the Bell System.
So effective was their solution that this 
prodigious task is now a matter of smooth 
routine. They designed desks which enable
each operator to reach quickly the listings of 
some 15,500,000 telephones. They developed 
apparatus which automatically routes calls to 
operators not busyand should all operators 
be busy at once, it stores up calls and releases 
them in the order received!
Efficient telephone service depends upon 
working out interesting problems like this.

from the bulletin boards there are 
still some marauders who are prowl

Engineering Banquet 
Tickets Now On Sale
Why the different colored tick-, 
ets for the annual Engineering 
banquet? This question has been 
asked of the officers and the men 
connected with activities so often 
that an explanation seems to be in 
order. The explanation in itself is 
a sad tale- of a broken dream. It 
appears that the officers of the 
Night College of Engineering de
cided to select two teams in an 
effort to stimulate sales. These 
two teams were called the "Reds 
and the Blues, and tickets of 
corresponding colors were sent to 
the respectively selected teams. In 
addition, there was to be another 
group whose tickets were white 
and this group was to consist of 
the four officers.
The idea in itself, while not an 
original one, might have been a 
good one to obtain larger sales of 
tickets which, it is expctcd, would 
not sell as fast as in previous 
years. However, there was a good 
deal of opposition raised on ac
count of the selection of the teams 
due to various differences of opin
ion and the plan has been definitely 
abandoned. From this it will- be 
seen that the colors of the tickets 
liavfi; nosignificance whatsoever.
Although the two teams are not 
able to compete for the prizes 
which wbre to be offered by the 
officers of the college, this docs 
not mean that the force of sales
men will be substantially reduced. 
In fact, the men who had been 
chosen for the teams arc expected 
to sell tickets anyhowr, and anyone 
else for that matter, who wishes to 
try his salesmanship is perfectly 
welcome to their ranks. Tickets 
can be obtained from any of the 
usual sources, and credit on this 
work will be given towards the 
Council Insignia Award.
The fact that there will be no 
teams attempting to break each 
others records should not materi
ally affect the number of tickets 
sold. The spirit of the salesmen 
does not arise naturally from a 
desire to beat the other fellow, 
but rather from their desire to 
make the banquet a bigger succcss 
than ever before. No matter what 
your opinion of the matters leading" 
to the abandonment of the idea 
was, dont forget that ,the banquet 
is the only opportunity the night 
Engineers hav<? to get together as 
a body except for the two smokers, 
which by the way, arc seldom well 
attended.
So lets all show more interest 
in the banquet than we do in the 
smokers, and put the affair across 
in a big way. Dont forget that 
the s.uccess of the banquet depends 
more than ever before on the num
ber of iickcts bought AND PAID 
-FOR, due chiefly to the drop ir 
registration -which cut down Engi
neerings pro rata allowance on the 
Activities Fee which we paid at the 
beginning of the year.
Now, it is up to the Night En
gineers to show all and sundry 
that wc arent going to allow mere 
differences of campus opinion to 
turn the banquet *into a farce. Even 
if money is tight, make a spccial
WHO IS CARNEGIES 
LONG DISTANCE 
NIGHT STUDENT?
A rcccnt newspaper article told 
of a mid-western student who trav
eled weekly a total of 175 miles to 
attend night school and claimed 
for him some kind of a record. 
But here at Carnegie we know that 
this is mere childs play, for there 
are no doubt scores of night stu
dents who not only equal this rec
ord but greatly surpass it. The 
question now is: Who is Carnegies 
champion long distance traveling 
night student?
The Plaid is planning to conduct 
a contest to find out just who this 
person whose thirst for knowledge 
is who travels so many miles in 
search of an education. Students 
from all over the surrounding ter
ritory nightly attend classes at 
Carnegie but one of them can 
make the record of this mid-west
erner look pale in comparison. 
Let?-hear from these students and 
maybe well award a prize.
The results of the contest will 
be published weekly as they come 
in and some time after the first of 
the year the winner will be officially 
declared a champion. All of you 
commuting night students arc urg
ed to enter into this novql contest 
for the title of Carnegies Cham
pion Traveling Night Student.

Camels are Kept Fresh!
You probably know that heat is used in 
the treatment of all cigarette tobaccos.
But you know too that excessive heat 
can destroy freshness and fragrance.
Thats why there could be no truly fresh 
cigarette except for scientifically developed 
methods of applying heat.
Reynolds is proud of having discovered 
and perfected methods for getting the
benefits of heat treatments and still avoid-, 
ing ever parching or toasting.
With every assurance we tell you, Camels 
are truly fresh. Theyre made fresh not 
parched or toasted and then theyre kept

Football and the Coaches
The 193.1' football' season at Carnegie is- ended and in the matter of success, as measured in the number of vic
tories, this years efforts indicate no special achievement.The team placed on the gridiron this year has been 
more near the typiqal college squad, as regards ambition 
and spirit, than the majority of the teams of the district. Consequently a greater number of moral victories has been 
publicly accorded Carnegie this year, than heretofore has been thought possible. Congratulations are due the cap
tain and the members of the squad only, as they have done 
their share quite well.Last years unusual combination of stars had a disappointing season,while this year's squad gave an intcrefiting but unsatisfactory showing. The previous group had 
experience and ability, the present squad had, enthusiasm 
blit neither revealed any evidence of exceptional coaching.Carnegie, expressly a scientific and practical school, 
retains a most unusual situation in its football coachipg. 
The arrangement whereby one man trains a squad for an 
entire week and then steps back to allow another to handle the team during a game is unique but undoubtedly illogical. 
In fact the entire organization of the coaching staff is illogical, for in each case the school is competing with 
business or politics for the coaches' time. A man who can give his entire interests to the job of coaching and 
who realizes the importance of securing. good ,auxiliary 
coaches, especially a good line coach, is the apparent need 
at Carnegie. Other colleges have found that complete reorganization, in case of an unsatisfactory arrangement, has 
in practically every case.proven a great improvement. Why not apply such experience to our own campus?
Conch Steffen, having served an exceptionally long 
period during which time he has' become prominent: as it successful conch, has indicated that he is unable to further devote his time to the guiding of the Carnegie team. 
.Recent years have found him able to spend less and less time here in his official duties, and doubtless realizing the 
futility of a system centered about a commuting coach, lie has declared this year to be his last.
At present a number o"f the older members of the 
athletic council, the usual number of -alumni, and other friends, are trying to persuade him to remain. The major
ity of the students and players themselves are in favor of a change but as yet have made no active indication of their convictions. The opinion of the former, group is influenced 
to a great deal by sentimental interests; that of the mem
bers of the school by a more impersonal outlook. Which should be of the greatestbenefit to the school?
Interfraternity Council
Revision of the Interfraternity Co'uncil rushing rules, 
as suggested .last week in this column come in time to pre
vent any injustice occuring to' the innocent party, the 
rushee. The increased fine for each violation of the established regulations should have the desired effect of. making 
the fraternities think twice before taking a chance on attempting a violation. . Especially with the excessive drain 
on the fraternity budget this year, the prospect of the loss 
of' one hundred dollars should prove sufficient reason to prevent the foolish practice of breaking the rules.
No International Next Year
The International art exhibit, just concluded at Carnegie Institute, may not be continued next year because of 
unusual economic conditions. It is to be regretted that 
Pittsburgh will lose, next year, an exhibition which is a great stimulus to the development of art. The Interna
tional is of further value in that it reveals to the outside 
world that Pittsburgh, the legendary home of soot, dirt, and things purely mechanical, really occupies a place in 
the world of culture. The directors of the Institute must have sufficient reason for their action, but it is to the 
interest of the people of Pittsburgh that some sacrifice be 
made to retain the exhibit which, beside securing international attention, attracts over 200,000 visitors.
Peace Above Party
Whenever an international dispute arises, no matter 
what party is in power, demand at once that your Govern
ment offer to refer it to arbitration, and if necessary break with your party. Peace is above party. . . . Concentrate 
your efforts upon the one question which carries 'in its 
bosom the issue of peace or of war. , . It is by concentrat
ing upon one issue that great causes arc won.Andrew Carnegie.
Much has been said of the value of experience. It is considered a requisite for success in any undertaking. Some 
men obtain it by the old and costly trial and error method. 
Such a method though perhaps ultimately effective takes too' 
long, besides being expensive. The new way is to utilize 
the experience of others, to read and study the methods of 
those who have achieved distinction in their own .field.
RUSHING SEASON
'JusT A -ic.u
FROM THE FENCE
The Battle of Dormitory Hill
About 9 a. in. of Dcccmbcr 5 the attacking 
force began to mass in front of the Inn. The mob 
was steadily augmented for half an hour. By and 
by well nigh ten score good men and true (not 
saying how'good and true) had lined up on the 
starting line and strained forward -waiting tensely 
for the signal which would announce 9:30 Helava 
time. About two seconds before the dead line a 
couple of fellows lost their balance and fell over 
the line. That precipitated the gold rush and the 
race was on. A seething mass of humanity swept 
up over Scobcll 
Terrace and the 
McGill Boss 
steps. Chet 
Williamson was 
first to touch 
base. It cost 
him three 'but-, 
tons. If anyone 
ever had the 
idea that fraternity men were sophisticated or 
dignified the sight of the pell mell rush and the 
sound of the savage cries of hunters in sight of 
the kill would sadly explode thein impression. 
Soon cries of "Aw you can cut some of those 
dates for me! What ever you do, .brother/ get 
liim for all day Saturday, thats what counts. 
Say, I'll take care of you all week. And thus 
dear children starts the actives Hell Week. Long

Singers Dance
Tho Glee Clubs threw a very nice dance up 
in the Union last l\'riday. Uuz/.y Kountz, alias 
led Lewis Kountz, dragged some Avcrra werra 
nice music out of his band. With the dull glow 
furnished by the colored Hood lights the corners 
'of the Union were almost as dark as the tunnels 
when you cant find the light switch. An investi
gation iu one corner revealed H. D. and N. N. 
holding hands. J.he. clink of glass on glass came 
ever and anon from behind the curtain behind the 
orchestra. Fred Latham went up to the stage 
after the dance tii claim a lamp ho had loaned 
to the orchestra. Someone inquired if Freddie 
needed the lamp to find his way home.

All For Charity
A new game, this of the members of the foot
ball team paying to play. Wc thot that' it was 
stage money they were using for the benefit of 
III; newspaper pictures but were really glad to 
learn that it was shore 'null currency out of 
their own pockets. Oh well, they get afree meal 
now and then so should be able to afford it as 
well as anyone. The Kilty Band gave an exhi
bition between the halves that stole the show 
from the football men. If any college, bar none,
has a better band than our own Kities well have 
to see it to believe it. The game looked like a 
set up if there ever was one but it kept the cash 
customers 011 the edge of their scats which of 
course was the important thing. A1 Minetti, as 
usual, was responsible for the only decent Tech 
cheers. The police pull some grandstand stuff by 
bowing to the ovation they received from their 
friends (?) in- the Tech sections. As a result of 
a wager at the game about 30 Tech men are 
cultivating upper lip growths from now till 
Christmas.* * * * 
Doins
The Hut Library is so comfy and homelike (?) 
that students forget tliemselvc.s and think that 
they are at home and leave their apple cores, 
chewing gum and mint wrappers, crackers boxes 
and other items of rubbish deposited on the tables 
and window sills. If that is feeling at home they 
must live in barns. There arc plenty of waste
baskets in the Hut . . . The mens musicians 
union of Art School celebrated with a party 
somewhere in East End the olncr nitc. Several 
of the fellows, not used to such entertainment, 
overdid themselves and came to rue that nitc . . . 
The'other evening the Athletic Association ten
dered the football men a bigger and better meal 
at the P. A; A. A number of the city fathers and 
Sponsors of Football at Carnegie were present 
and each made a gorgeous speech about what a 
nice guy the previous speaker was. Wally Steffen 
paid-a splendid tribute to Capt. Airmen trout, then 
made an appardnt farewell address, but finally 
wound up by saying lie didnt know whether lie 
would come back next year or not. And guess 
what, folksies! What? Bert Munhall got himself 
a wife a spell back and kept the deed under 
cover until the banquet. Dont see why he would 
want to hide that light under a bushel . . .

CONTRIBS
THAT MYTHICAL ACTIVITIES 
BUILDING
Just when the students of Car
negie first gave voice to their de
sire for an activities building is 
also a matter of ancient history. 
Far back in the Carnegie Tartan 
files numerous articles and editori
als can be found that were written 
in an attempt to - induce interest 
and to initiate the first necessary 
steps. Indeed; during the year 
1928-29 there was an- earnest cam
paign during which the Student 
Council and various other campus 
organizations set aside approxi
mately $14,000 solely for the activi
ties building. Still, nothing' really 
tangible has materialized. Why?
The customary answer is that 
funds are lacking; the basic reason 
may be that a planthe kind that 
fosters interest, enthusiasm and 
finally, supporthas been lacking. 
In general, a reputed educational 
institution encounters only' minor 
difficulties in securing funds for 
worthy projects when a meritori
ous, carefully work-out plan can. 
be presented. Those that have 
been suggested thus far for the 
new activities building arc meager 
and superficial, but one scheme 
still in its infancyseems to be 
worthy of more serious considera
tion.
Essentially, this plan proposes 
that the new activities building 
be located on the site now occu
pied by the Commons and be con
structed of sufficient size to con
tain a. large student lobby, *a com
prehensive librarj, offices and fa
cilities to centralize student extra
curricular activities, possibly a new 
cafeteria in .the basement, and a
general assembly hall. The gen
eral appearance of the building 
would conform to the present 
white, brick structures, while a high 
clock-tower, facing the Administra
tion Hall at one end of the build
ing, would lend a genuine univer
sity atmosphere to our campus. 
Incidentally, the Hut and the Com
mons, both mislocated leftovers 
from the war, would be displaced.
Such a building would centralize 
campus life and enhance the value 
of Carnegies social affairs. In this 
building chapel services could be 
held, public lectures given, and the 
entire student Tjody could assemble 
for its meeting. Perhaps the Drama 
department could use an auditorium 
of ample size to seat its audiences, 
which have loiig since outgrown 
the Little Theater, the Student 
Council, the Y. M. C. A., the pub
lications staffs, the honoraries, and 
other functions that arc now locat
ed in scattered and cramped offices, 
could move into more comfortable 
headquarters. This enumeration 
lists only a few of the possible 
services of an activities building 
such assuggested by this plan.

Golf
The question as to whether or not 
Carnegie shall have a golf team has 
been more or less in the limelight 
for several semesters. Pitt and Duqucsnc Have had golf teams for quite 
a while, while Yale and Princeton 
have participated .11 intercollegiate 
golf for severaldecades. Shall Car
negie Tech lag. behind? The willing
ness of the student body to try out 
for new athletic activities was 
evinced by the marked enthusiasm 
which created our, scrappy boxing
team. If a golf team were to be 
organized, I feel confident that it 
would prove a popular and interest
ing extra-curricular activity.
It Would be possible for me to 
ramble on indefinitely' in this talk 
about golf at Carnegie. However, 
what is needed is not flpwcrly. words 
and effervescent phrases but action. 
It seems to me that a good plan 
would be for someone possessing 
the authority to call a meeting of all 
students interested in golf. At this
CLUB NOTES

is the cantata by George B. Neviri, 
The Adoration.
The Choral Club, an organization 
of 30 voices, has been spending the 
past two months in preparation for 
this program, and it is certain to be 
worth hearing. An invitation is ex
tended to all who desire to come, 
whether members of the Oxford Club 
or not.

Ballots Show Women Favor Compulsory Military

400 Students Vote
(Continued from Page One) 
join in similar reductions. In the second question, the vote is evenly 
divided between "None and 100%. There is a definite viewpoint ex
pressed in this count, for both seniors and sophomores, representing 
the majority of the voters, turned in equally balanced ballots. As for 
the third question on disarmament the 400 have voted decidedly 
against the United States as a mo.del nation in regard to the reduc
tion of armament expenditures.
Military training in the college curriculum was the subject of the 
next two questions. Again the entire group voted together. It is quite 
evident that although military training is extremely popular among the 
entire student body and although they are in favor of its being re
tained on the college curriculum, still their votes prove just as em
phatically that the students resent compulsion. It is also a curious 
and amusing fact that the greater per cent of the women who voted 
favor compulsory military training in college. Perhaps this is due to 
a well-known phase of feminine psychology.
Length of military training experienced by the male voters previous 
to taking of this poll varied from one month to twenty years. The 
average length of previous military\ training was approximately ten 
months per man.
STUDENTS PLAN
(Continued from Page One) 
dium will be used for picturing the 
races of the -world in conflict with 
such gigantic forces as war, dis
ease, poverty, and ignorance. A 
specially-arranged trip to Niagara 
Falls will be among the added at
tractions which will help the stu
dents combine a. real holiday trip 
with a most/ significant student 
convention.
The Student Volunteer Movement 
is a student missionary association 
which gives its members a chance 
to better ' understand modern for
eign missions with intelligence. Its 
conventions, serve the,: purpose of 
guiding the thmking-of the present 
college generation.

TELEPHONE
Date with Home
OME FOR CHRISTMASwhat Could 
be better! Nothing, of course, 
except more of it and oftener. 
Then why wait for holidays to visit Mother 
and Dad? Reach them tonight by telephone 
its next best to seeing them.
Thousands of college men go home each 
week by telephone. Thats one date theyd 
never cut! Try it yourselfyoull soon see 
why. For a lasting pleasure you cant beat a 
voice visit. And if it gives you a kick, think 
of the thrill it gives the home-folks !
FOR THE LOWEST COST 
AND GREATEST EASE
Set your "date for after 8.30 P. M. and take ad
vantage of the low Night Rates. (A dollar call is 
60c at night; a 50c call is 35c.)
By making a date the folks will be at home. Thus 
you can make a Station to Station call rather 
than a more expensive Person to Person call.
Just give the operator your home telephone num
ber. If you like, charges can be reversed.'
