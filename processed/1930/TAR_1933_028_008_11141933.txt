Guild Sponsors 
Collection of Toys
i The Carnegie Guild is beginning 
its annual toy collection this week. 
In previous years, the ' toys which 
have been collected at Christmas 
time, have been sent to missions. 
This year the Guild is planning to 
give the toys to families in Pitts
burgh. It is believed that the gifts 
will have more significance if they 
come from the hands of the par
ents.
The toy collection has been start
ed early this year because the mem
bers of the Guild Board, working 
with a freshman committee and the 
handcraft department, have under
taken to repair the toys. The Guild 
wishes to emphasize the fact that 
the toys do not have to be in per
fect condition to be acceptable.
Boses for the toys will be placed 
in the front hall of Margaret Morri
son and the lower hall of the Col
lege of Fine Arts.
Art Critics Commend 
Kostellows Painting
Professor Kostellow is receivin; 
much praise for his painting,. After 
pinner. which won honorable 
mention in the current Carnegie In
ternational Exhibition.
Edward Alden Jewell of the New 
York Times says. -His modern, intellectualized 'Holy Family, com
posed, I should say, quite flawless
ly, is reminiscent in every brush 
stroke of the ateliers of twentieth 
century Europe.
The following comment by Har
vey Gaul appeared in the Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette: Mr. Kostel
low won an honorable mention for 
his compact canvass, After Dinner 
and if you ask us, he should have 
received a higher appraisal. The 
work is solid and it also has its 
moments of elemental humor. He 
knows the value of distribution and 
he binds the whole work with flats 
and contours. He trowels in paint 
and underneath that thick pigment 
is capital drawing."
Penelope Redds criticism in the 
Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph is equal
ly laudatory.  After Dinner by 
Kostellow is entirely self contained 
without reference to psychology, 
illustration, or accidental mood. 
There is a livingness about this 
painting which makes it, for me, 
the most vital canvas in the entire 
exhibition.
Dr. W. Evans 
Will Address 
Next Chapel
President Baker Presides 
Over Third Service 
In Little Theater
ALL FRESHMEN ARE 
URGED TO BE THERE
Musical Program Includes

Dr. Evans has always been a 
great lover of sports and during 
his undergraduate career at col

with the Los Angeles Athletic,

active membership in this organ

Drama Dept. 
Will Present 
Play Tonight
Man and the Masses 
Tollers Best Play 
Critics Claim
SOCIAL REVOLUTION 
IS THEME OF DRAMA
Greatness of Play Depends 
On Creative Artistry 
Of Its Producer
The second major production of 
the Department of Drama, Ernst 
Toller's Man and the Masses 
(Masse Mensch) under the direc
tion of Professor E. W. Hickman, 
will open in the Little Theater to
night and continue for six evening 
performances. One matinee per
formance will be given at 3:30 011 
Friday for which 110 tickets of ad
mission will be required.
Critics Praise Play 
Man and the Masses is a trag
edy of the social revolution which 
some critics claim to be Tellers 
best work. It offers a great op
portunity for artistic production, 
for the true greatness of tills play 
depends so much upon the crea
tiveness of the producer. Equally 
important for the Department of 
Drama, it is also valuable as an 
omotioual exercise for tho training 
of its students In acting.
As far as can be discovered, the 
production of Man and tho 
Masses to be staged in tho Little 
Theater will be tho sixth in the 
history of this play. Tho original 
production was staged In Berlin by 
Foliling. Others followed In Lon
don, in Liverpool, in New York by 
the Theater Guild, and In Pough
keepsie, N. Y., by the Vassal* Ex
perimental Theater.
Written In Two Days 
Although Toller is an ardent 
Communist' and Man and tho 
Masses Is a play of tho Com
munist revolt, It Is really a poets 
profound questioning of revolution. 
The author relates that I10 wroto 
the play In two and one-half days. 
He had been thrown Into prison 
and subjected to extremely brutal 
treatment, and his furiouss rosentinont took form I11 this drama.
Toller was not granted permis
sion to attend tho production of 
his play In Borlln, and was forced 
to content himself with writing 
letters in answer to tho criticisms 
It received at that time,
The characters In the play are 
more than human; they are uni
versal. The protagonist. Is a 
woman, and the only Individual 
personality of all tho characters In 
tho play. She Is profoundly con
vinced that 110 cause can bo really 
won If it Is won at tho price of war 
and bloodshed. She charactbrlzes 
tho human soul, swayed by desire 
and fear, ambition and pity. 
Against her stands hor husband, 
representative of the State, who 
tries to dissuade tho .woman from 
the Communist leadership she has 
assumed. Other characters com
plete the symbolization of tho in
evitably tragic conflict botwoen 
man, the Individual, and the needs 
of the mass, a conflict which Is es
sentially in tune with the spirit of 
present times.
Unusual Setting Used 
The production here will bo done 
after the expressionists manner 
on a stage hung in black velours. 
The varying moods of the play will 
be co-ordinated with chorus group
ings and mass movements under 
the direction of Miss Cecil Kilcat, 
instructor in Eurythmlcs. Light
ing effects will bo planned to male 
extensive use of color, with quick 
changes to mark sudden transi
tions in the tone of the play.

Educational Senate Is First Group 
To Be Explained in Tartan Series
Editors Note: There are a num
ber of groups on the campus whose 
actions and decisions are of vital 
Importance to the administration 
and activities of Carnegie. Since 
the parts played by a greater ma
jority of these groups are un
known or vague to most students, 
a series of articles, this being the 
first, will be published explaining 
the selection and functions of these 
groups.
The Educational Senate is the 
legislative body which, with the 
concurrence of the President and 
Trustees, has final responsibility 
in determining policies regarding 
admissions, courses of study,, and 
standards of scholarships; re
quirements for graduation, degrees; 
and, in general, ail purely educa
tional matters.
It Is particlarly charged with 
jurisdiction over all educational 
legislation affecting two or more 
colleges, or affecting the institu
tion as a whole. It considers 
questions of educational policy 
raised either within Its own mem
bership or the membership of its 
committees, or referred to it by 
the President; Executive Board, or 
by the general faculty, or through 
their representatives on the Sen
ate.
It also has the power to initiate 
recommendations to the President, 
the general faculty, and the college 
faculties on other matters not ex
clusively educational, but which 
have a bearing on the educational
work of the institution.
The Educational Senate is con
sidered a committee of the geneual 
faculty, and its elected member
ship is subject to recall by action 
of the general faculty or the col
lege faculties which they repre
sent. But it Is understood that the 
general faculty delegates to the 
Educational Senate its authority 
and power regarding educational 
policies, and that the actions of the 
Educational Senate do not re
quire confirmation by the general 
faculty.
The Educational Senate confines 
its deliberations, as far as possi
ble, to the consideration of general 
education policies leaving to the 
Executive Board, the standing 
committees, the college faculties, 
and the departments concerned to 
carry out the policies In detail.
Whore the representatives of one 
college takos exception to any 
action of tho Educational Senate, 
the Senato, on request of such rep
resentatives, defers action until 
the following regular meeting. In 
case any college ^objects, through 
one of its representatives In the 
Educational Senate to any action 
of the Senate, the minute of such 
objection made by the objecting 
member is sent to the President, 
with the action of the Senate.
The Educational Senate consists 
of the Directors, Registrar, and the 
Head of the R. O. T. C., ex-officio, 
together with the two representa
tives elected by each college and

Finding a suitable code for tho

the most difficult tasks of the NRA 
administration. The present pre

erable discontent among the em
ployers and Its final acceptance is 
doubtful. Because of these diffi
culties, Mr. John J. DeViney, sec
retary of tho United Typothetao of 
America, has been forced to re

will be unable to speak as origin
ally scheduled. Mr. Elmer J. Koch 
has been secured to speak In his 
place.
The Department of Printing is 
now engaged in the production of 
the current issue of Printing Edu
cation, the official publication of 
Education of the United Typothetae of America. Professor David 
Gustafson, head of tiie Department 
of Printing, is associate editor of 
the magazine.
Production of the publication is 
under Llie supervision of John C. 
Martin, Charles W. Pltlcln, and 
George F. Thomas, instructors. 
About 2,600 copies of Printing Ed

2THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY. NOVEMBER 14, 1933
THE 
TUESDAY 
QUARTERBACK 
 
BY JACK LOWES
MR. GRAHAM McNAMEE, WHO DID M03T OF THE ANNOUNCING 
FOR THE NBC in tho Purduc-Carncglo game, wao not pronouncing the 
name of our alma mator corrcctly during the first half, but In the sec
ond stanza It wao noticed th.it ho wao getting the accent on the "NEG"
in proper style. Moasro. Boyer and Rhodes, who wore sojourning at 
Ponn State for the week-end, were directly responsible for this sudden 
improvement. Tiring of the evil practice, thoy dispatched a telegram 
to Mr, McNamce about tho llttlo mattor.* * * * * *
THIS SATURDAY THE TARTANS WILL HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A 
BREATHER, bul thon you can never toll about till game of football. 
On top of that, Carnegie Tech ha never looked good against these 
BO-called breathers. AgalnHt Xavier, tho local lad looked very bad 
both this and last year. W. &, J. Ih another team that make the skibos 
look very Had. Last year the Tartan topped off a disastrous eaon 
by drubbing tho Washington lad to the tune of 51 to nix, and what 
the result will be till time 1 hard to anticipate.
In 11)28 Georgetown had a great deal to ay about ;|ut who would 
represent the east in the Rose Bowl tournament, it eerii as If Car
negie, N. U., and Georgetown had jut about the three bet team in 
tho section. A three-cornered draw resulted, and Georgia Tech made
the trip and Incidentally won, 8-7. Carnegie beat the Hoyas without
much trouble, 13-0, bul tho latter then turned around and smacked tho 
Violet by a 7-2 core. N. Y. (J. promptly retaliated and routed the 
Carnegie lads In the eaonH finale, 27-18.* '# * * * *
WITH THE SEASON NOW TWO-THIRDS OVER, the Carnegie Tech
griddcrs can still either make or break this season. Of the three re
maining games to be played, N. Y. U. and Pitt stand as two of the 
teams that Coach Harpsters men would like most to beat. Tho great 
game N. Y. U. put up against the highly touted Fordham last Saturday 
seems to indicate that the Violets are greatly underrated. Of course, 
the Fordham-N. Y. U. game is very similar to the Pltt-Carnegie battle 
in that almost anything can happen.
Pitt showed that they have everything that has been claimed for 
them when they outclassed the Dukes in the Stadium.* * * * * *
WHILE LAST SATURDAY'S GAME MAY HAVE BEEN A DISAP
POINTMENT to a number of fans, I am Informed by good authorities 
that the battle In reality should lend encouragement to Carnegie sup
porter. Due to improved blocking, the running began to function 
somewhat better. The Michigan State- ends were being blocked out at 
loast occasionally, and Terebus took advantage of tills by getting off a 
number of good runs. Tills Terebus would be a mighty sweet ball 
carrier If he got even fair Interference. * * * * m
THAT EIGHTY-YARD BOOT OF JOE MIHM'S from behind his own 
goal line must have boon a mighty nice play to watch. Mlhm is just 
beginning to come Into his own this season, and a lot should be heard 
from him before this year's curtain is rung down. * * * * *
IT SEEMS AS IF THE SOPH ARCHITECTS PLAYED THE PLEBES 
of the same department last Saturday. The second year men came 
off with a 15-2 decision for no good reason whatever. Botli teams were 
rewarded with a number of bruises and stiff joints for their efforts.******
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT A CERTAIN NOTORIOUS PUPPET 
COLUMNIST was somewhat slowed down in the last issue? It seems 
as If he is becoming aware of that People who live In glasses houses" 
Qatl-******
COACH R1SEDORPIT, director of hydraulic activities, is feeling better 
about his prospects now. He has found that ho is going to have a 
pretty hot foam after all. Although he will miss several stars from 
last years squad, he will bo blessed with a bettor balanced unit tills, 
season. Last your ho had llttlo trouble taking most' of the firsts, but 
the Plaid swlmmors just couldn't got enough of those oilier places.

nl'ter a iiorlo of very tough giiiuon, 
It Is not llltoly that tho Washing
ton boy will offer any strenuous 
opposition, and Tech should come 
through with a comfortable mar
gin. Thus far Gorgotown  lias 
failed to hold its own against 
mediocre competition. Previous to 
last Saturday when Western 
Teachers of Kentucky piled up 2-1 
points to Georgetowns goose-egg, 
Western Maryland and Boston Col
lege found easy victory with scores 
of 20-0 and :?i)-0 respectively. In 
one of the earlier games of the 
season Georgetown managed to 
hold Manhattan to a 20-20 tie.
N. Y. U. should offer a little 
more competition on the following 
Saturday when Tech plays in New 
York, although this game will also 
be somewhat of a rest in prepara
tion for the Thanksgiving battle 
with Pitt. N. Y. U. has showed lit
tle promise this year, after a weak 
West Virginia Wesleyan team de
feated them 3-0 at the opening of 
the season. However, the Violets 
eked out a 13-12 win over a fair 
Lafayette team, but lost to Colgate 
and Georgia. One of last Satur
days surprises was the unexpected 
stand which N. Y. U. made against 
Fordham, holding the Rams to a 
20-12 victory. Fordham Is rated as 
one of the first class teams in the 
country and had hopes of a perfect 
season until St. Mary's handed 
them their first, defeat a week ago, 
18-6. Consequently, tho New York 
U boys seem' to bo showing some 
much noodod improvement.
Pitt ran true to form and crashed 
tlio|r way to a 7-0 victory over tho 
previously uiulofoatod Dukes, in 
splli' of doubts as to tho Panther's 
ability to hold the powerful hoys 
from tho Blu.lU, Pitt Is favored to 
take Tech when they moot on

may happen and Tech Is hoping, 
for tho host.

Stewart and Terebus Chief 
Scotch Threats; Plaid 
Line Shines Again
The Carnegie Tartans and the 
Michigan State Spartan battled 
through four quarter which re
sulted In a corele tie at East 
Lansing, Saturday. In six inches 
of enmuns and now, two powerful 
defensive lines fought to repeli any 
coring chance. Both teams had 
several opportunities to get over 
tin? final chalk line, but when they 
got within a few yard of the goal 
they met a solid brick wall.
In the second period, the Spar
tans carried Lhe ball on a long, 
march from their 15-yard line to 
within Inches of the Plaid goal, 
where the Tartans received It on 
downs, On a blocked punt, the I 
Skibo got tho ball on the State 
30, and carried It to the 8-yard line, 
but here the Michigan boys stopped 
them and.polled one more chance 
for a score.
One of the outstanding features 
of the game was the punting duel 
between Milim and Armstrong. In 
tills battle of beautiful kicks, Milim 
had the edge over Armstrong, av
eraging 47 yards on 15 punts, while 
the State back averaged 44 on 10 
attempts. Mlhm got off some mar
velous punts, several times getting 
the Tartans out of danger.
The outstanding player on the 
field was once more the stellar 
Tech guard, "Bunny Burzio. As 
in Lhe previous encounters of the 
season, lie nt credited with break
ing up most of the oppositions of
fensive plays. In fact, the guard? 
of both teams were playing beauti
ful ball, but Burzio was playing the 
most beautiful of all.
The whole Tech team deserves 
much credit for its good work. 
Charlie Splsalc received his first 
major assignment when he was sent 
In at quarterback. Lib Lewis final
ly broke hi jinx and managed to 
play through the whole four quar
ters. Captain Red Stewart was 
right u]) and in there, playing right 
up to ills usual strong game. Tere
bus was outstanding, being directly 
responsible for most of the gains 
in the Plaid marches toward tho 
Spartan goal.

By SCOTTY CHARLES
Joe Mihm is just a local boy who 
is making good. I-Ie came to Car
negie with quite a reputation as an 
athlete and lias maintained it in 
spite of tougher competition. He 
is one of the most versatile lads 
that ever stepped on a gridiron for 
the Plaid school. Weighing over 
two hundred pounds and not being 
very tall, he is surprisingly fast 
and naturally hard hitting. On the 
offense he is capable of doing 
most everything. His line plung
ing is notoriously ferocious, his 
kicking is the best in the district, 
and Ills blocking Is among the best 
on the squad.
He was a regular fullback in his 
sophomore year but did little other 
than kick and block. This year he 
is doing his first ball carrying and 
doing it well. Mlhm through the 
line always means a couple of sure 
yards. In the Purdue game he dis
played his surprising speed when lie 
made a spectacular intercep
tion and raced down the field 
for a touchdown, even sidestepping 
two tacklers on the way. His kick
ing ability speaks for itself after 
last Saturday. With a wet, slip
pery ball on treacherous footing in 
the biting cold, Joe averaged 45 
yards to a kick which is swell punt
ing under the best of conditions. 
This put him right at the top of the 
local heap as  we notice that our 
rivals on the surrounding hills av
eraged 42 and 35 yards for their 
booting under the same conditions. 
On the quick kicks Mihm is always 
dependable, not havng had one 
blocked yet. 1-Ie is also a fine run
ner of interference as his superior 
weight usually manages to smash 
nil a couple of the inrushing tack
lers.
Mihm, paired with OToole or 
Terebus, is an excellent line back
er and strenghtens greatly the Tar 
tans defensive play. His sterling 
play in this position and as a short 
pass breaker has won him a reputa
tion as one of the most dependable 
and versatile backs in the dis 
trict.

This has been the Tartans, 
toughest season as there are only 
two breathers on the Plaid sched
ule. The first' with Xavier wasnt 
as much of a push over as was ex
pected, for the Cincinnati lads 
made it tough for the Tartans by 
being primed for the game. Next 
week, however, the Plaid should 
find the going easier against a 
team which has shown little or 
nothing all year. Georgetown was 
scheduled as soft pickings and it is 
hoped that they will be just that, 
as the Carnegie gridders need a let 
up in their intensive campaign 
after battling Notre Dame. W. & 
J., Purdue, and Michigan State on 
successive Saturdays.
Georgetown will, undoubtedly, be 
set for the fray as this is easily 
their biggest game. Even this 
should not help much against the 
strong Plaid line and snappy pass 
attack. They have won one game, 
tied one, and lost four to teams that 
are not notably strong. Mt. St. 
Mary of Washington fell before 
them but the next week they lost 
to Canisius. The ManliattanGeorgetown game ended in a 20-20 
tie. Then in quick succession 
Western Maryland, William and 
Mary, and Boston College took the 
measure of the Washington lads. 
This week they take the Tartans 
on and then finish up with West 
Virginia. The defeats have all 
been rather decisive and little scor
ing strength lias been shown.
The Georgetown team has yet to 
chalk up a single victory over the 
Plaid squad and this does not seem 
to be their year to do it. . The first 
time they played the Plaid was vic
torious by a 13-6 count. Last year 
the Pittsburgh school cleaned up 
to the tune of 51-0. This year 
Georgetown will be primed to pre
vent a repetition of last years 
marathon. It is up to the Plaid 
to buck this stubbornness and take 
the boys in hand. The odds are all 
with them and they are expected to 
come through with another win.

The Carnegie Tech harriers did 
some very decent running last Fri
day afternoon in the meet.,with 
Pitt. A rather crippled running 
crew it was that met the powerful 
Panthers on the snow covered 
Schenley Park course, yet the Skibos placed two men out of the first 
four and five out of the first ten, 
holding the strong Pitt runners to 
a margin of only nine points vic
tory, which is narrower than has 
been effected for several years.
A beautiful running exhibition 
was given by Frank Giolma, who 
crossed the finishing line first after 
traveling the four and one-half mile 
course through the snow in 23.52. 
For three-quarters of the course 
Giolma maintained his position be
hind four of the Panther runners 
and then as the course was 
leaving the golf grounds he spurt
ed to the front. He maintained 
this position to the finish of the 
event.

Social Season

Balcony Studio 
Witli Gay Party
Cider, doughnuts, music and 
many other features did their bit 
for the housewarming held by the 
sculpturing students when they in
augurated the two new balconystudio rooms last week.
No studio is lit to use unless 
properly warmed and there are no 
better warmers than art students, 
particularly mud students, sculpturs in case you don't understand. 
The combined day and night class
es pooled their funds and decided 
to do a bit of warming, and how it 
was done provided many a laugh 
and much applause (not apple
sauce) for the audience as well as 
the performers.
The evening started with the de
scent of the instructor from his 
lofty perch, led by such a person
age, whoso knack for Impersona
tion puts some so-called actors to 
shame, the party gained great mo
mentum. Stories, music and reci
tations followed in rapid succession, 
each bringing down ' the house. 
Then a temporary lull was called 
and everybody indulged in cider, 
doughnuts, apples and marshmal
lows, which, after all, was the most 
Important part of the program.
A few more songs, more Addle 
and accordlan music and the even
ing came to an end. Everybody ad
mitted it was a great party, even 
those who came dressed in costume. 
(Some of them wore cute, to say 
the least.)_____________________________

Personal Effort
Change in Number 
Of Council MailboxIdle Thoughts 
of an 
Idle Night 
Student
It seems that the engineers owe 
a vote of thanks to someone for 
that parking space and handy en
trance at the north end of Engi
neering Hall. It is a great conven
ience tobe able to step out of ones 
car and directly into a warm, well 
lighted corridor leading to the 
classrooms. In previous years the 
engineers could park no closer to 
their classes than the drive beside 
the Industries Building, and in 
some cases were forced to search 
as far as Woodlawn avenue before 
they found room to squeeze into a 
parking place. This inconvenience 
was particularly apparent on cold, 
rainy nights when the wind was 
howling across the Quadrangle, 
and the mere thought of a long 
sprint in the blustering weather 
was enough to discourage the most 
ambitious. However these dismal 
occurrences are things  of the past 
and peace and comfort now prevail.
If there are any students who are 
unfamiliar with the entrance to 
this parking place it is very easily 
found. Simply enter the Machinery 
Hall driveway and take the branch 
to the right leading under the 
steps following this to its end. 
Another drive will be found lead
ing to the right and parallel to the 
Quadrangle. There is ample room 
for a line of cars on 6acli side of 
this driveway and at- its end will 
be found an entrance to the first 
basement of Engineering Hall.
An example of the trend of 
thought among industrial leaders 
appeared in a brief Quotation in a 
current issue of a technical maga
zine. The quotation embodied 
most of the changes necessitated 
by conditions of the last three or 
four years. The thought expressed 
by the author was that the days of 
individual advancement through 
the reflected glory of a subordi
nates work are past.
A few years ago, It was possible 
for a man possessing a pleasing 
personality to work himself into 
his employers confidence without 
the exercise of a large amount of 
technical knowledge. It is true 
that many men have established 
their reputation through hard 
work, but. it is also true that many 
other well trained 111011 have failed 
to achieve success simply because 
they did not possess some small 
social accomplishment, which could 
have no bearing on their technical 
ability
Night students sending corre
spondence to the Night Student 
Council are asked to send their 
mail to box 136 instead of box 
137. This change has just re
cently been made and students 
are asked to mark the change 
in their handbook and address 
ail future mail properly so that 
there will be no delay occasionThe first inter-college dance of 
the Night School social season will 
be held in the Gymnasium 011 De
cember first, the day after Thanks
giving. As the tickets ror this af
fair will soon be in the hands of 
the salesmen, it might be a good 
idea at this time to review the 
rules governing sales on the cam
pus.
If the students who are working 
for an Insignia will turn to page 
twenty-six in the Night Handbook 
they will find there a rule which 
forbids the sale of tickets in the vi
cinity of the hall in which the func
tion is being held on the night of 
the dance. The penalty for break
ing this rule is the loss of all points 
earned for that activity. However, 
good sportsmanship, not the penal
ty, Involved, should dissuade the 
workers from infringing on this 
rule.
The purpose of mailing these 
tickets to the students is to in
crease the popularity of these 
dances. It is exrpected that the 
recipients of the tickets will sell 
them to their fellow students and, 
also, to their friends outside the 
school. Those students who at
tempt to sell their tickets at the 
door on the night of the dance are 
actually defeating the purposes of 
the Council.
It is quite certain that the men 
who have indulged in this practise 
have not considered the signifi
cance of their actions. However,
 as an evidence of their good faitli. 
it is suggested that they extend 
their fullest cooperation in the fu 
t.ure.

Thursday Nigli I
Believe it or not, but the fact re
mains that we still have in our 
midst those who are not satisfied 
with what privileges they have. 
They want more. Its like this. 
The other day we had white lines 
painted on the drive in front of the 
Industries Buildings indicating 
stalls for our gas wagons. Well, in
stead of being satisfied with their 
own ample space, some of the parlcers have appropriated part of the 
next stall, and what does this 
/mean? Well, it means that if 
enough did it, the balance of the 
parkers would be without places to 
park. Guess we will have to police 
the place and take the numbers of 
all those who forget the other fel
low and turn them in. This would 
be a good problem for a vigilance 
committee to take up, and pending 
further developments. I am going 
to look around and see how many 
numbers I can get which are over 
the line.
A recent article appearing in the 
Tartan mentioned there were sev
eral vacancies in the Kiltie Band. 
It may be of interest to the night 
student body to become members 
t)f this organization, provided they 
meet the necessary requirements.
In the past several years a few 
night students have always been 
members of this famous band and 
gone on the trips that the boys 
make from time to time. The band 
plays at all athletic events and 
many other functions of importance 
in addition to making several trips 
during the year.
The night school, through the 
Night Student Council, has always 
shown much interest in the Kiltie 
Band. At one time the Night 
Council donated several uniforms 
to the band and just last year the 
Night College of Industries outfit
ted each member of the baud with 
an individual blanket of special de
sign and weave. This year two 
night students collaborated In de
signing and making stainless steel 
emblems which they gave to the 
band. These emblems added con
siderably to the attractiveness of 
the Scotch Kilt.
Any night student interested in 
trying out for the band may do so 
by reporting to Harvey Harrod at 
band pi'actice in the Womens 
Gym at 7:30' p. m.f any Thursday 
nifent.___________________________________
The ambitious student, look
ing ahead to a successful ca
reer in business or profes
sion, will find that a connec
tion with a reputable bank
ing institution is a real step 
forward. Plan to make such 
a connection while you are 
in college  the Mellon Na
tional Bank welcomes ac
counts of any size and our 
oUlcers are always ready to 
Interest themselves in your 
problems.
Of course, there will be times 
when parking over the white lines 
will not be an infraction of the 
rule, for instance when it snows. 
That would be a justifiable excuse, 
that is, if the said snow were left 
on the ground, but wait. How about 
snow plows? That's an idea. An 
excellent opportunity for employ
ing some of our worthy unemploy
ed. Better get your name on the 
list for the job, and then hope for 
snow, snow, and more snow.

Pittsburgh, Pa.THAT the Arts-lndustries-Engineering dance held recently 
was a huge success.
THAT trying to keep these 
dances confined to students of 
one particular school is harder 
than selling fans to an Esquimo.
THAT some Night Council 
big shots were seen visiting the 
Arts school the other night. 
Come, boys, what kind of a con
ference was it? Whats the 
telephone number?
THAT the Arts school seems 
to have quite an attraction for 
the Industries and Engineering 
boys and it certainly can't be 
art alone that has such a 
strange power over them.
THAT the first Student Coun
cil dance will soon take place 
and here is a tip, get the best 
girl friend lined up for its go
ing to be a swell affair.
THAT the sculpturing stu
dents held a studio warming 
party last Thursday night that 
from all indications was a howl
ing success.
THAT day and night students 
participated in the above event. 
That's the spirit, lets have more 
get-together affairs because 
we're all members of one big 
family.
THAT all the loud huzzas 
about the white parking lines 
on the drive don't mean a darn 
thing to us pedestrians.
THAT the No Tickets" sign 
is always in evidence when 
night students try to get those 
coveted pasteboards for the 
Little Theater.
THAT that's that and I'll bo 
seenya.
I am not certain, but I have 
heard, at least some of my fellow 
associates (?) tell me so in conver
sation, .that so far this year park: 
ing is not the problem it used to 
be. It is hard to say what the rea
son is, but I feel it in my bones 
that the white lines certainly have 
)een a big aid in this direction.
Cheated again. There was a 
school holiday last Saturday and 
/ve night students didnt participate 
n the layoff. Why can't the school 
lolidays fall on the night we have 
lasses. It certainly seems that 
/e are in for1^ hooking all the time. 
Take the Monday following the big 
(lefeat handed Notre Dame. There 
Were .no day classes, at least the 
flay students thought so, so a holilay was taken, unofficial of course, 
put a holiday nevertheless. Not so 
for the night classes.. We had to 
blug right along with our class atendance, shop, lab, whatever have 
ou. Thats the cost of education.
I tell you, those Kilties are at it 
;ain. Did you see them in the 
arade last Saturday. It certainly 
fas a sight to behold that Tartan 
mtfit doing their bit for the suc:ess of the parade. And the way 
they held the line; well some of the 
potball squads of the country 
Diould have been there to get pointRs. Best of all was the way they 
tooted their horns. Surely' was 
Ine to hear our "Dear Old Tech,

ilayed while in the line of march, 
tvho wouldnt be proud of such an

Perhaps no more aHinine practice 
Is to be met In college than that o 
paddling pledges by fraternities. 
Despite the fact that it is a relic 
of the Dark Ages, a carry-over of 
a medieval time when punishment 
was universal, despite the facts 
that it is Inhuman and Ineffective, 
It Is still a popular disciplinary 
measure on the B.C. campus.
It Is to bo regretted that Intel
ligent fraternity men cannot see 
the 111 will, the feeling of tension, 
antagonism, anger, distance that 
paddling Instills in a pledge. The 
crack of the paddle never encour
ages that brotherly attitude which 
fraternities seek to develop in its 
neophytes. Instead there is noth
ing but Indignity; rebellion Instead 
of cooperation is the result of using 
this antiquated method.
Monday night a pledge to a lead
ing Southern California fraternity 
fainted after a barrage of swats. 
Is this instilling a fraternity spirit? 
We wonder. There are more in
telligent and much more effective 
means of developing a cooperative 
attitude and there are more rea
sonable ways of making "men out 
of pledges than by paddling.
Not only does the obsolete prac
tice create a social distance be
tween the pledge and other mem
bers of the fraternity but it 
destroys all the illusions of fel
lowship and brotherhood that have 
been built up in his mind during 
rush week. It defeats its own pur
pose, despite all the argument of 
fraternity men that It binds the 
neophyte more closely to the house 
and to its own pledge brothers.
Whatever worthy purpose cor
poral punishment may have, if any, 
It falls far short of accomplishing 
It.The Dally Trojan.

are Arts School freshmen ... to whom are 
being revealed the inner workings of big league

waging the annual battle . . . preliminary to the 
fraternity melee which comes all too soon.
Festivities began last Friday . . . the Beta 
Tau Lambdas gave the young ones a tea at the 
Pines . . . the Tri Gams brewed the leaves 
closer to liome^-at the Schenley Hotel . . .
Friday eve was Beta Pi night at the Brown Man
sion . . . much of the evening was spent in ad
miring the lovely young ladies whose pitchers 
adorned the walls ... if you liked pictures - . . 
silly similiesas successful as a Beta Pi press

We saw an awfui lot of people (not a lot of 
awful people) but we cant remember just where 
they belong . . . think it was at the Alpha Kap 
affair that Libby Carlin was the head person 
. . . also, programme-passer Betty Farrel with 
Jack Landau, Tommy Ryder and Kay Doty, A1 
Friddy and Margy Bateman . . . Sue Fuller and 
Tim McCoy were around somewhere and we saw 
Brad (Three Wheel) Edelblutwith an oprey

Beckey Williams and fiance Fred Rankin were 
doing there bit ... the faces of Mary Jane Pro

. . . the B.P.8s were accused of spiking the fruit 
salad with punch . . . you ended up in the
kitchen if you tried to slip in a swolce in the 
Brown Mans . . . everybody wound up at Gam

see the day when theres someplace else to go 
after a dance.
Plans are already under way for the most gi
gantic Pep Meeting in the history of the school 
. . . the Rally before the Pitt game . . . the 
object is to have every student attend ... it has 
never been done before on this large a scale . . . 
it couldnt be done in a school less famous for 
its spirit than Carnegie . . . every Carnegian 
who wants to lick the old Panthers will be there 
. . . which means that none of us will stay away 
. . . that's our contribution to a potential vic
tory . . . how about it?
If you seniors havent been there yet, youll 
get a big kick out of the passport methods they 
use in taking your picture. We were getting the 
old poison-ality smile worked up for the first 
snap and they told us we were all through. 
That's the first time weve ever been in moving 
pictures.If you hear Goodridge humming a song to him
self, its probably that one about, You've got to 
be a football hero to get along with the gals."

year ago there were perhaps four oi us making the rounds. 
Now there are at least forty persons who go from one rubbish 
can to another. You can see them with all sorts ol: vehicles 
baby buggied, wheelbarrows, kids express carts. Down at the 
commission houses they just swarm and scramble for vegetables 
and fruit. The most pitiful sight is when it starts to get dark 
and there arc few lingerers around the commission row. Then 
you see men and women who would be ashamed to do it in day
light, slinking around like coyotes, going through the leavings, 
literally going through slop'cans. They dont seem to be as 
hardened as we are and their clothes are better looking. In
stead of carrying a sack as we do, they have handbags and seem 
to bo shocked when they see some one observing them * *
This excerpt from a letter written to the editor oi: The Nation, 
explaining why the writer must drop his subscription, paints a 
vivid picture of the conditions under which many of the people 
in this country are existing today.
We as students must awake from, our drowsy mental out
look on the worldbreak down the bars that separate us from 
a true knowledge of present conditions in our country and shock 
ourselves when we sec how our fellow beings are living. Not 
one, or a thousand, but hundreds of thousands of our people are 
becoming petty thieves, gutter snipers, and are becoming 
morally degenerated.
How much longer will this condition last? The Americans 
are a docile people. They, led by the spirit of the pioneers that 
have paved the path for a nation, and by the spirit ol! the brave, 
immigrants who, with great sacrifices, crossed the Atlantic to 
stail; life anew, can take mimy blows and adjust themselves to 
conditions but there is n limit and when a docile nation 5s 
aroused they can become fierce.

No professor hovers over you at

down the aislesmuch in the 
manner of a suspicious guard in a 
Sing Sing cell block. You sit there 
free to do as you like.
That freedom is guaranteed be
cause Alabama men and women 
have banded together under an 
Honor System. That system gives 
them a full measure of self-esteem. 
They are trusted. The University 
Is risking the value of its degree 
011 the students honor. And Avliilo 
the bit of parchment may not 
menu much to the student who 
pumps gasoline after graduation, 
it means a great deal to the Uni
versity.
The Honor System places every
one 011 Ills or her honor. But overyone cannot bo trusted. The brutal 
way would bo to penalize all for 
I,I10 possible dishonesty of a few. 
University men and women have 
not followed that course. Tlioy havo 
chosen tlio gentleman's way. Any 
student who in seen cheating Is 
noted by ills follow-classmatos. He 
In marked as unfit; nnd either 
loaves tlio University at Ills own

theory remains only a theory, tho 
System will follow tho Bonfire to

RIDE EM COWBOY! Every sccond is crowded with danger 
for Eddie Woods,, twice all-round cowboy champion at 
the famous Calgary Stampede. It sure takes healthy 
nerves to stay on board a fighting bronk I Camels arc 
my smoke, says Eddie Woods. They never 
jangle my nerves.
Much can bo said pro and con for the consorvatist but the 
prime fact, remains that the conservatives have ruled I lie world 
and governed our actions. The radicals have opened the high
ways to new fields and theories and the conservatives havo de
veloped the dreams of these men who have faced the brunt of criticism unafraid.
Man has little choice in his status. Conditions do much to 
bring out ones characteristics along the lines mentioned but 
the real attitude comes from within the mind. The radical 
often does not live to see the fruits of his labor. His re
imbursement being spl^satisfaction and presence of mind for 
having done that which he considered right.
Tlio conservative! follows the beaten path reaping tlie re
wards of 1he pioneer who preceded him and often building a 
name for himself oil the grave of one who died nnthanked.
Find tlie man who combines the two and von have a real 
success. The world will look up to such a man but has no place for extremists along any line.

ON SECOND THOUGHT
By Will Landsberg
Finallyrepeal.
After thirteen years of trial, 
America is ready to relinquish her 
noble experiment and atone for 
her sin. For undoubtedly, it is a 
sin on tho part of any government 
to dogmatically persist in enforc
ing a law so evidently contrary to 
the will of the people. Back in tho 
years 1919-1020, prohibition, rising 
011 a wave of righteousness and 
solf-sacrliloo following tho war, 
carefully manoouvored itself into 
tho Constitution. For thirteen un
lucky years, it pursued its narrow 
path, sowing tlio soods of many of 
the nation's Ills 011 tho way. Excopt, porliaps, for its very early 
stages, it. is doubtful if there over 
was a. timo when it fulfilled tho 
wish of the majority. Beginning 
as America's noble experiment, 
it eventually resolved itself into 
Americas Crime, giving impetus 
to an ugly, nncontrolHable crime 
wave, fostering a. llngmnt disre
spect for tho nations laws, and de
priving tlio federal government of 
a sizeable amount of revenue. The 
intensty of the oppostion to it is 
clearly shown by the almost unan
imous demand for its repeal. Now, 
one year after the election of a 
new administration, we prepare 
prohibition for its grave, once and 
for all. And its demise is 1111- 
mourned but not forgotten. Prohi
bition shall remain as a constant 
reminder to the American people 
that never again must they allow 
any such restriction on their lib
erty to find its way into their Con
stitution. Prohibition has admin
istered a lessonand in doing that 
it bestows its only benefit.
Actual repeal goes into effect De
cember 5. Will the country be 
plunged into sudden chaos and de
bauchery then? I11 all likelihood 
the next two or three years will 
bo a period of experimentation in 
liquor control. Ten states have al
ready passed control laws and 
others are calling special sessions 
to do likewise. Out of this ver
itable laboratory a satisfactory sot 
of liquor laws for oaeli region may 
ho evolved. Stress Is being laid on 
distinction botwoon boor andwino, 
011 the one hand, and hard liquor 
on the other. A minimum regula
tion of the former and a maximum 
regulation of the latter, will do 
much to promote temperance, it 
is sufficiently realized that;, though 
the control of liquor may supply 
t he government with a. badly need
ed source of revenue, attempts to 
overtax would only invito smug
gling and bootlegging.
The most important factor in the 
success of this liquor control ex
periment will bo tho attitude of 
the people. It is regretable that 
repeal should have to come at a 
time coincidental with tho release, 
to the workingman, of more hours 
of leisure, because of NR A. If lie 
doesn't use his added leisure time 
to form new or revive old vices 
if, in other words, the nation 
adopts an attitude of moderation, 
a successful solution to the liquor 
problem will have been found.

better. Most important of all, 
Camels do not jangle my nerves, 
even when I light up one Camel 
after another.
If you ai-e nervous... inclined 
to fly off the handle... change 
to Camels. Your own nerves and 
taste will confirm the fact that 
this milder cigarette, made from 
costlier tobaccos, is better for 
steady smoking.
bven a bnow Man 
would get "that way
if you Ret fitted in Nisleys 
 and how beautifully 
they do fit !
Eddie Woods, one of the top 
hands of the cowboy world, says: 
Ten seconds on the back of 
an outlaw horse is about the 
hardest punishment for a mans 
nerves that anybody can imag
ine. To have nerves that can take 
it, I smoke only Camels. Ive 
tried them all, but Camels are 
my smoke! They have a natural 
mildness, and I like their tasteNo one who boupht tics like this for campus 
wear will ever worry nbout their shoes in 
btul wcnthcr. Shown in brown or blnck.
