Seniors Urged 
To Return Blanks 
Before Vacation
Seniors are urged by the Bureau 
of Recommendations to return 
their employment blanks as soon 
as possible, preferably before the 
Christmas vacation. At the pres
ent time about one-third of the se
nior class has submitted the forms.
Care should be used in the re
cording of information on these 
forms, as quite frequently employ
ers will use the employment infor
mation sheets to make a prelim
inary survey of prospective em
ployes.
When filling in the personal his
tory record on the line marked 
'Name and address of some rela
tive or person who will habitually 
mow your address, be sure to 
>ut the name and address of some 
Pittsburgh person. This will prove 
ii great aid in future years to the 
Alumni Recorders office in search
ing for lost addresses.
If there are any seniors who 
vere not present at Mr. Beattys 
alk a week ago and consequently 
lid not receive the necessary 
orms, they may obtain them and 
other information at the Bureau 
)f Recommendations, Room 155, 
lollege of Industries, any day be
tween 9:00 in the morning and 
5:00 oclock. Seniors are invited 
when they turn in their blanks to 
discuss their problems and pros
pects with members of the Bureau 
staff.

Phi Kappa Phi 
Initiates New 
Members Wed.
Dr. Clausen To Speak 
At Dinner Following 
Annual Ceremony
The Carnegie Chapter of Plil 
Kappa Phi will initiate its new 
members tomorrow at five oclock 
in the Carnegie Inn. A dinner will 
follow the initiation, and a short 
address will be made by Rev. 
Bernard C. Clausen, ,D. D., the new 
pastor of the First Baptist Church 
of Pittsburgh.
Phi Kappa Phi was officially in
stalled on the Carnegie campus 
Saturday, June 3, 1932. This hon
orary is a society for students and 
faculty members who are scholas
tically outstanding. Its purpose is 
to foster learning in the life of the 
undergraduate by offering him 
membership on an equal basis with 
members of the faculty.
Selection to Phi Kappa Phi is 
based entirely upon scholarship 
and character. A student, selected 
from any department, must have 
finished at least three years of a 
regular four-year course leading 
to a Bachelors degree or higher, 
and must be in the upper one-fiftli 
of his class scholastically.
Director Jewett pointed out, in 
his address given when Phi Kappa 
Phi was granted a charter, the 
fact that because of the approach
ing extinction of Alpha Tau, Col
lege of Industries scholastic hon
orary, the new honorary would not 
conflict with any other existing 
campus organization.
Tho local chapter's constitution 
provides that only one-half of tho 
upper fifth of the graduating class 
in any college may be selected, and 
che national ruling provided that 
ten or more faculty members must 
petition for installation of a chap
ter. The members of the faculty 
and administration staffs who peti
tioned and became charter mem
bers are: President Thomas S.
Baker, Director Arthur C. Jewett, 
Prof. Thomas D. Mylrea, Prof. 
Charles 'C. Leeds, Prof. David Gus
tafson, Dr. Lawrence R. Guild, 
Prof. Allen II. Blaisdell, Prof. Glen 
U. Cleetoii, Prof. Robert B. Lelghou, Prof. William F. Hitchens, 
Dr. Charles Watkins, Dr. Webster

Clifford G. Dunnells. Prof. Willi

Miriam Busch Wins 
First Prise for Doll
Three prizes and three honora
ble mentions were given by Kaufmanns for the best dressed dolls 
in the fashion show which the Cos
tume Economics Club held last 
Wednesday. The first prize was 
awarded to Miriam Busch '35; sec
ond prize to Evelyn Gillespie '36; 
and third prize to Martha Moss 
'35. Honorable mentions were 
made to Marjorie Jane Fitz Hugh 
3G, Geraldine -Stoll 36, and Fran
ces Callahan 35.
Kaufmanns department store is 
displaying the dolls- in a window 
this week,
The dolls are now on sale. Some 
of the money from the sale will 
be used to buy dolls for poor chil
dren for Christmas. The rest will 
be set aside as the nucleus of a 
scholarship fund from which schol
arships will be given to members 
of the club.
Play Is Work Behind the Curtain

ing the training and experience 
which enables him to pace and 
mold the plays succession of lines 
into a -meaningful unity; back 
through the one, two, three, or 
more years when the plays actors 
were absorbing the training which 
made them responsive instruments 
able to recreate every varying 
nuance demanded of them, by its 
author and director; back through 
the years when its technical work
ers were acquiring the specialized 
knowledge which makes it possible 
for them to suitably mount the 
play.
Ignoring this antecedent prepa
ration, a plays present history in 
the department is still quite com
plex. Rehearsals begin usually
about five weeks before a play is 
scheduled to open. Within two 
weeks everyone in the cast is renuired .o have memorized all his

Mary Provost 
Elected New 
W. S. O. Pres.
Organization Will Give 
Nine Scholarships 
During Year
MAKE FIVE AWARDS 
STARTING NEXT FALL
Recommendation Suggested 
By Former Officers 
Is Adopted
Mary Jane Provost '35 has been 
elected president of the Womens 
Scholarship Organization for the 
year 1934-35. The organization held 
its final meeting of the year last 
Wednesday. Miss Provost, who 
was elected at that time, is a ju
nior in the Department of Painting 
and Design; sheis president of 
Beta Pi social sorority, and was 
one of the two vice presidents of 
the Scholarship Organization this 
year.
The election for president was 
held early this jrear in accordance 
with recommendations from last 
years officers that the new presi
dent be elected at the close of 
the years activities, in order to al
low ample time for the arrange
ment of the following years pro
gram. The remaining officers will 
be elected early next year from 
the new members of the organiza
tion.
Nine scholarships will be award
ed during the next year by the 
Scholarship Organization to de
serving women on the campus. 
From available funds of over $900, 
four $100 scholarships will be 
awarded next semester, and five 
$100 awards will be given at the 
beginning of the fall and spring 
semesters next fall. These five 
scholarships will be given in sums 
of $50 each semester. $197.42 of 
the entire fund was earned by the 
benefit performance on October 
31 of Helen Hayes in Maxwell 
Andersons Mary of Scotland.
Several recommendations have 
been contributed by this years or
ganization. It has been suggested 
that the president name a com
mittee whose function it will be to 
make out a new mailing list.
The suggestion has also been 
made that, instead of having the 
Scholarship Organization function 
as a whole in raising money, the 
various organizations represented 
have their own project, each mak
ing some money individually, and 
then contributing what they make 
to the Scholarship Fund.

O'Brien) will preside over the fes
tivities in which everyone will par

work on a new campus revue 
which will be presented next 
spring during the Spring Carnival. 
Under the direction of Regis Joyce, 
Polly Rowles, and Audrey Kelly, 
of the Department of Drama, the 
organization hopes to offer a pro
duction of higher caliber than has 
been previously attempted.
The directors wish it to be 
known that this revue is an allcampus affair, not merely the pre
sentation of one department. An}'- 
nne having material for skits, 
lyrics, or music is requested to get 
in touch with James H. McNaughton 35. Choruses will be assem
bled later in the year.

Early Figures Forecast 
Decrease In Number 
Of Men Pledged
MANY INFRACTIONS 
OF RULES RUMORED
Competition Is More Keen 
This Year With Fewer 
Out-of-Town Men
At a late hour Sunday night 
available lists indicated that 147 
men had been pledged by 18 fra
ternities as a result of tho fall 
rushing season which ended offi
cially at 1:00 Sunday morning.
While these lists are not com
plete, comparison with similar fig
ures from last year forecasts a sub
stantial decrease this year in tho 
number of men who luivo pledged. 
Early lists last year carried a total 
of 170 pledges, 1G per cent more 
than this years preliminary total.
Humors of widespread Infrac
tions of the rushing rules have 
multiplied rapidly, and if they ma
terialize many formal charges will 
probably bo laid before In tor fra
ternity Council. That body this 
year made a number of changes in 
tho rushing rules which were In
tended to eliminate this umlosirablo element. The lack of coraploto co-operation among the fra
ternities, however, has brought 
forth tho announcement from intorfratornlty Council that further 
rovlslons will bo made in the rules 
for noxt year.

Campus Library Affords Students 
Solutions to Educational Questions
By VERONICA KLOOS
A diminutive yet compactly ef
ficient unit is our campus library 
at Carnegie. It is difficult for us to 
realize, so interested are we in fol
lowing our individual lines of re
search, that the library provides 
adequate and practicable informa
tion for every one of the college 
courses. Not only on the shelves, 
lined with old and new reference 
volumes and textbooks, but In the 
maga/Jne racks, filled with tech
nical periodicals, journals, and 
monthly publications, may students 
find solutions to educational ques
tions, All the best writers of fic
tion and poetry aro likewise Includ
ed In tho collection, although theso 
are far fewer than tho reforonce 
books.
Each month tho library adds upproxlmatoly one hundred books, 
many unbound volumes/ portfolio 
works on the arts, and pamphlet 
lo Its collection. The selection of 
these Is based almost entirely upon 
requests made by the students. 
Among the books added during the 
past month are several of general 
interest to us, such as The Shape 
of Things lo Come by H. G. 
Wells; Mellon's Millions by Har
vey OConnor, and "Requiem by 
A. E. Fisher, of our English Department. Of special interest Is 
the book Aluminum by II. St. C. 
Deville. It was written In 1859, but 
recently translated into English 
for the first time by P. J. Ander
son. Before aluminum became so 
indispensable to tho world at largo, 
Deville wrote the book in an ef
fort to bring tho vital Importance 
of the metal before tho public. The 
flno points of tho authors style 
and the excellence of his ideas 
have only recently boon approelated.
But students may spend hours in 
the library for recreation rather 
than for work. Current magazines 
such as Harpers Bazaar, Rend
ers Dlgost, Vogue, and 'Life 
are adequate amusement for an kilo 
hour, Costume Economics stu
dents may find inspiration for 
smart clothes In all the popular 
fashion magazine, whllo Drama 
students can Iceop In touch with 
their favorite artists through simi
lar medium.
Perhaps the most curious feature 
of our library is the small part 
very seldom seenthe attic. This 
is a dim, musty, leathery-smelling 
little storehouse for out-of-date 
magazines and possibly ancient 
textbooks. Up here the literary

GAME IN NEW YORK 
TO BE FOR CHARITYFROM ALL APPEARANCES THE TOURNAMENT OF R0SE8 "champlonohlp" game this coming Now Year's Is going to bo nothing moro 
than a laugh. In past years the game han boon moro or loos of n.na
tional championship game In which the champions of tho east played 
the champions of tho Pacific Coast. This year tho eastern representa
tive, at .least, can hardly bo classed as championship callbcr.
Columbias selection for this honor Is no crcdit to Stanford. It 
glvoo tho Impression that tho Cardinals woro deliberately picking a 
pushover In order to koop tho honors on the coast. 
STANFORD'S Why they should havo to look around so far for one 
SHAME is beyond mo, for any team that takes over Southern
California and California shouldn't have to ask any 
quarter from anybody.
Stanford, as viewed by tho man in the street, does not have an 
cxtromcly Impressive record, Inasmuch .as they havo been tied onco 
and beaten once, but the fact remains that these westerners have 
beaten two of the most powerful machines In the country with a sopho
more team. This decision, then, does not soom worthy of the team 
they boast.******
LET US CONSIDER COLUMBIA'S SHOWING FOR THIS SEASON. 
After heating Lehigh easily, they nosed out Virginia, 15-G, a team that 
had been beaten by Ohio State 75-0 the previous week. The next Sat
urday the Lions were soundly thrashed by Princeton, 20-0, Since then 
tho Bltie and White have defeated Pehn Slate, Cornell, Navy, Lafayette, 
and Syracuse, none of whom have had even a fair season.
Columbia, therefore, is practically an untried eleven who has had 
but one real test all year, and In that one test they wero In no way 
equal to the occasion. Stanfords giving them the bid thus seems very 
foolish ,Indood.
Great Play of J*laid Accs 
Attracts Attention 
Of Many Coaches
By JERRY HANSON
It has been rumored In reliable 
circles that Captain Colin "Red" 
Stewart and Bernard "Bunny Bur
zio of tin* 1933 Carnegie football 
team will he tendered bids to play 
in the annual North-South game, 
which will be played this year in 
tho Yankee Stadium In New York 
City on Christmas Day. Official an
nouncement that the Tech hall 
players will receive bids has not 
yet been made.
Stewart Is Great End
"Red" Stewart, candidate for 
left end, has been playing the var
sity end position in the Carnegie 
line for the past three years. He 
Is recognized as one of the best 
ends in this district, his playing 
being occasionally flashy but al
ways consistent. Stewart excels 
at receiving passes, and he is also 
excellent on the defense.
Red" has received several men
tions for berths on All-American 
teams, and a mention on the AllEast team. Stewart is yet a possi
ble candidate on the latter team.
Captain Stewart is a senior in 
school and will be leaving at 
the end of the year. His position 
will be a difficult one to replace, 
and his los will be felt generally 
next year.
Burzio One of Best
Bunny Burzio is one wno' might 
ho termed "a natural at the art 
of playing football. Though weigh
ing only 170 pounds Burzio is like 
the proverbial stone wall as far as 
the opposition is concerned. He is 
one of the best defensive guards 
In the country. This recognition 
has come to Bunny in spite of 
the fact that he has for nearly tho 
entire season been handicapped by 
a back that was strained early in 
the year. He has played every 
game with an adhesive cast sup
porting the weakened part of his 
body.
Burzio was a contender for AllAmerican honors this year, and ho 
was mentioned In tho All-East 
team, I-IIs talent was best display
ed In the Notre Dame game, dur
ing which he made 38 of the -J3 
lackles. Most of the teams 
against which Carnegie Tocli play
ed after the Notre Dame game 
laid for Bunny, and in some 
games, such as that with N. Y. U., 
two men were placed against him. 
Burzio Will also he lost to the team 
next year.
Craig and Forbes 
OaklandON THE OTHER HAND STANFORD WAS FACED WITH A DIFFI 
CULT PROBLEM. All the really strong teams were tied by confer
ence agreements which forbid them to partake In post-season games. 
Pitt was the only exception. The Panthers were one of the strongest 
teams in the country and certainly deserved the bid, but circumstances 
were such that it would be impractical to Invite them. On the past 
two invasions of the coast they have fared very badly, and It Is prob
able that they would not be the drawing card they should be. Pitt 
was massacred 47-14 by U. S. C. In 1920, and last year the same team 
took them over by a comfortable count of 35-0.
Columbia is an old school of high scholastic reputation, and the 
prestige connected with the New York institution was largely instru
mental in their surprising bid to represent the cast in this widely pub
licized battle.
Intramural Fans 
Will See Classy 
Boxing Tourney
Intramural boxing, under the di
rection of Coach Ernie Sesto, will 
begin competitiively tomorrow, De
cember 13, when the first prelim
inary bouts will he run off in the 
Carnegie Tech gymnasium. The 
second group of preliminaries will 
he run Friday, preceding Christmas 
recess, and the final bouts will 
start during the week of school 
following Christmas.
The training for intramural box
ing competition has been going on 
lor a couple of weeks now, and the 
Interest shown by prospective par
ticipants has developed to a high 
pitch. Practicing has been com
prised of an hour's workout each 
day. About fifty members of the 
fraternities and dormitories have 
been training consistently. Even 
during the week of fraternity rush
ing there was no great slackening 
of interest in the sport on the 
parts of the members of fraternal 
organizations who have been train
ing. The boys from the dormito
ries are working with a will, and 
they will be able to offer some 
stiff competition In the bouts to
morrow and in those which follow 
later. With fifty participants and 
I ho Interest which has been shown 
to dato a very interesting tourna
ment is assured to be exhibited to 
tlie Tech students. The bouts will 
occur after the day school hours 
on the days mentioned above.
Varsity Boxing 
Varsity boxing will be a prominent 
sport on the Tartan campus this 
year. It is now a certainty that 
tliis sport will be offered to the 
students of Carnegie Tech again 
this year. A rather unlucky sea
son in this field last year secured 
an amount of agitation against the 
sport, but plans for better man
agement have dispelled all feeling 
against Tech's competing in var
sity boxing tourneys.

Thyratron-tuhe control for resistance seam

using Thyratron tubesan important part of 
the control. Industry obtained a new high
speed production tool.
This control, when applied to line- or spotwelding machines, permits 1200 current in
to mint lorn per minute. Thus, it makes 
possible the stitching together of thin metal 
sheets to form ^as-lignt and water-tight seams. 
Thyratron-controlled machines will weld stain

materials. Steel barrels, pails, milk cans, and 
gasoline tanks are just a few of the many 
products now produced faster as a result of

Idle Thoughts
ofan
Idle Night 
Student
I almost said everything, but 
here was a hitch. You know, a 
lance wouldn't be a dance without 
ome refreshments, or sumpin. The 
efreshment part was there, but 
:he sumpin was not. Please, 
nlster, wont somebody page the 
rozen aqua. The punch would 
slip down a bit more pleasantly, 
and then one could enjoy it more.
The Thanksgiving Dance from all 
iccounts was a big success. So 
here you are, we do have somehing to be thankful for after all. 
Ve are assured that the social 
unctions are not going to be cut 
nd that we can go on having a 
:ood time. The loud speaker sysem was the event of the evening. 
)ne did not have to put on ear 
hones to hear the rhythm, or 
hould I say feel the rhythm. Any
way, we danced and had lots of 
oom and
No, I didnt see any big casual
ties after the bars were lifted and 
the colored stuff began to flow (le
gally?) for after all, it did flow 
all the time. Dire misfortune was 
predicted by some of the know 
everything but some how all the 
publicized calamities didnt mate
rialize. Strange, the rank and file 
of the people arent given any cred
it for being sensible. Its the elect 
few who are endowed with all the 
brains, and the real lionest-tojoodness thinking people (horse 
sense if you wish) have to listen 
o their jargon. I wonder whether 
;hese select . few realize how' 
;mall they really are after all. Why 
:ant they pay attention to their 
Dwn habits and the let the other 
iellow alone. Perhaps a little sane 
;hought on the prohibition quesion on the part of the wiseacres 
ivould reveal how unjust the whole 
measure wa j. I have seen some 
of the most ardent advocates of 
he measure take their share when 
he door was closed and excuse the 
ransgression with the expression 
Prohibition is all right for the 
ather fellow but I know how to use 
lie stuff. Funny isnt it what 
Strange mortals we are.
Well, Christmas is just around 
he corner and this means more 
ime for us away from the campus, 
'hese two holiday periods are comng close together. If it keeps up, 
ve will be having more holidays 
han class periods and then 
wouldn't I be glad. Yes sir, Friday 
ight will be the last time for s. 
ear that we will have to report 
;or night classes. So heres hoping 
/ou have a big time, lots of fun 
neverything. Merry Christmas to 
/ou, and you, and you, and may the 
New Year be what you want it to 
oe, lucky.

Student Workers 
Called for Dance
Students who are willing to help 
in preparing for the Night College 
of Engineerings Christmas Dance 
are requested to report in Thistle 
Hall on Saturday, December 16, at 
two oclock. Points toward an in
signia award will be awarded for 
all work done at this time. The stu
dent is reminded that a part of the 
work done to obtain this award 
must be performed at functions of 
the college in which he or she is 
registered. Therefore, this dance 
will provide the engineers who are 
interested in activities, and who 
are anxious to earn ther keys to 
turn out for an affair of their own 
college and earn part of the credit 
that they are so anxious to get to
ward the coveted pin.
Stolen Car of Night 
Industries Man Found
The Night College of Industries 
student whose car was stolen re
cently has cause for deep rejoicing. 
His automobile was recovered by 
a radio cruiser not two ,iundred 
feet from where it had bee.i stolen 
fourteen days earlier. The police 
are to he commended and the stu
dent congratulated upon the suc
cessful termination of the search 
for the car. Since no further 
thefts on or near the campus have 
been reported, it seems very safe 
to assume that the recent theft 
was an isolated case that will not 
be soon, if ever, repeated.

clever lines become dull and ap

Rehearsals are often trying and 
exhausting. Every moment the 
actors mind must be intensively 
guiding, directing the creation of 
a character which may be very 
foreign to him in years, tempera

process which demands the utmost 
.in directed concentration: relax
for a moment or fail to take the 
pitch given by the others in the 
scene and all is lost.

Engineers Will 
Hold Xmas 
Dance Dec. 16
Officers Promise Gayest 
Function of Year to 
Those Attending
On Saturday evening, December 
16, the Night College of Engineer
ing will hold its annual Christmas 
Dance in Thistle Hall. This dance 
is, in keeping with the season, a 
Christmas gift to the engineers. 
No mere murmuring of Meiry 
Christmas by the engineers. They 
are going to celebrate the holiday 
season with a dance that will be 
the liveliest and gayest function 
on the years entire social calen
dar.
The officers have engaged Billy 
Weitzel and his orchestra to fur
nish melody, harmony and rhythm 
of the calibre necessary to a really 
good dance. The combination of 
this delightful orchestra and the 
beautiful, appropriately decorated 
Thistle Hall assures the engineers 
of a most enjoyable evening.
The first Christmas Dance was 
held two years ago in place of the 
traditional Christmas banquet. The 
banquet was not dropped, how
ever, but was held in the spring, 
as it will be this year. The tre
mendous success of the Christmas 
Dances of the past years showed 
that the majority of the engineers 
preferred this type of function for 
the holiday season. For that rea
son, the Christmas Dance is no 
longer on a trial basis, but has 
earned a permanent position on the 
Night College of Engineering so
cial calendar.
As usual, admission can * be 
gained upon presentation of your 
registration card. If you have any 
friends that would like to join you 
they will also be admitted at the 
nominal price of one dollar per 
couple. The dance promises to be 
a big success, and the bigger tlio 
turnout, the bigger a success it 
will be. So, be sure to come your
self and bring all your friends. You 
are guaranteed a good time.

study of several years at PURDUE

Public Commended for 
Repeal Night Sobriety
It is greatly to the credit of the 
American people as a whole to look 
back upon the first few days of 
the repeal era. The orgies, auto 
mobile accidents, and crimes that 
were expected to materialize by 
the drys were not in evidence. 
This district, for instance, had no 
disturbances whatever. In fact, re
peal night was just another night 
as far as the police were con
cealed.
The group of individuals who at
tacked personal liberties to the 
extent of forcing prohibition on an 
unwilling nation, and did their best 
to enforce a worthless law in its 
dying days, should feel somewhat 
nonplussed. They are apparently 
as rabid as ever, it would seem, 
for their predictions as to what 
would occur when liquor did come 
back could easily be misconstrued 
as an insult to the intelligence by 
the American public. But, since 
the public has shown that it does 
not consist of a witless group, the 
implications of those who would 
legislate salvation into the souls of 
men can well be ignored.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT we are going to get a 
nice long vacation starting next 
week. No more school until 
next year. Yours truly is going 
to catch up on a lot of lost sleep 
and take life easy . . . maybe.
THAT the holidays hit just 
right this year. Three days in 
a row in each case . . . not 
bad.
THAT one of the night organ
izations has something big on 
tap for the holidays and every
body knows about it but the 
members.
THAT the Engineers are 
throwing a clutch and shuffle 
party this Saturday night. You 
see mates, theres more in life 
than learning what keeps 
bridges up and makes street 
cars late.
THAT they are going to need 
some help in order to get 
ready for the above mentioned 
sole warmer, so come out and 
give us a hand.
THAT no casualties were re
ported among the night group 
for the evening of December 5. 
Everybody was too busy to cele
brate or maybe it's smart to 
be legal.
THAT we are wishing you the 
finest Christmas you have ever 
had, and may the coming year 
shower you with blessings and 
prosperity that will entirely 
erase the memory of leaner 
days.
THAT that's that and Ill be 
seenya.
Ask Students to 
Send News Items
In one of the early issues of the 
Tartan a request was made for 
contributions of articles from the 
night student body by the Plaid 
staff. While the response to this 
request was fair, the volunio of 
uews items received has since di
minished considerably.
Five night students compose the 
staff of the Plaid, the night school 
section of the Tartan, but anyone 
having an article of general inter
est to the student body is urged to 
submit it for publication. Marked 
writing ability is not necessary as 
the staff will be only too glad to 
assist the student in writing his 
article if the facts concerned are 
brought to their attention. All mem
bers of the staff are regularly reg
istered night students and as such 
have classes to attend which makes 
it impossible for them to complete
ly cover the whole school. Hence 
any contributions from the students 
would not only help the staff but 
would also aid in making the paper 
more interesting.
Any mailed contributions for the, 
staff will reach their destination if
Prompt Ticket 
Return Asked 
Before Holidays
So that the treasurer of the 
Night Student Council can make a 
report of the last dance all stu
dents are requested to make 
prompt returns of all sold or un
sold tickets. In order to avoid any 
conflict with future events it is 
urged that this be done at once. 
It is also necessary that this be 
done immediately so that proper 
credit can bo given toward an in
signia award as there is a time 
limit placed on the entering of 
these points. Returns should bo 
sent to Robert Lalir, Treasurer of 
the Night Student Council, Box 136 
and dropped into the inter-school 
mail slot of the post office. It is 
especially necessary that these re
turns be made before the Christ
mas vacation as no business will 
be conducted until school starts 
again next year.
Students Requested to 
Observe Campus liuling
The attention of the student body 
is called to the regulation regard
ing tho use of intoxicating liquors 
on the Campus. Despite the fact 
that tho National Government has 
permitted the use of alcoholic 
beverages, the use on tho (Campus 
of Carnegie Institute of Technology 
is still absolutely prohibited. It is 
urgently requested that the student 
body remember and strictly observe 
this regulation.

Mit incluir EditorA little cable dispatch from 
China the other day emphasizes, 
as few items ever do, the incred
ible age of the civilization of that 
mysterious land. It recorded the 
fact that a woman in Peiping can 
trace her ancestry directly back 
to none other than old Confucius 
himselfand that she is his sev
enty-seventh lineal descendant.
Since Confuscius was born in 
551 B. C. the family,is now a little 
bit less than two thousand five 
hundred years old; and a record 
like thatnot at all uncommon in 
Chinaeven when confronted by 
the most pretentious of western 
genealogies must look utterly in
significant.
In the face of this triumph of 
genealogy, the American who 
proudly traces his ancestry back to 
the Mayflower is merely pathetic 
and even Norman blood does not 
seem quite so blue.Dakota Stu

A NEW DAY BREAKING
Back in 1516 Sir Thomas Mores 
book, Utopia," predicted the fourhour day. Nov/, some four hundred 
years later, that dream is in a failway to being realized.
Machines and labor-saving inven
tions have freed man from the 
necessity of continually toiling to 
produce enough of the worlds 
goods.
Centuries ago, ten men would 
have had to labor from sun-up to 
sun-down to wrench from the soil 
a bare sustenance. Now, one man 
can produce enough to feed and 
clothe the other nine. The remain
ing nine thus liberated may turn 
their hands toward the things 
which are of lesser importance but 
which make this world a more 
pleasant place in which to live.
Many men are now available to 
raise the cultural progress of mankind to somewhere near the same
All-Carnegie Sororities
Sororities al; Carnegie arc unlike fraternises in that their 
membership is not open to all the Carnegie students. It is com
monly known that for several years the girls in Margaret Mor
rison have wanted to have their recognized sororities. At pres
ent there is one organized but it, for some unknown reason, is 
not recognized by the Intejsorority Council. At the same time 
the girls in the College of Fine Arts have wanted to have 
their sororities join with some national organization. This will 
always be opposed just so long as they do not work together 
with the Margaret Morrison College, recognize their desires, 
help them to organize and get recognition for their sororities, 
or open up the membership in the present recognized sororities 
to all women students at Carnegie.
Tlie present stand is in opposition to the true spirit of 
sororities, that of banding the girls together for a more inti
mate acquaintanceship. It has promoted hard feeling between 
the girls of Fine Arts and Margaret Morrison and has drawn a 
definite line between their friendship. Fraternities draw their 
members from all colleges at Carnegie in which men are en
rolled and find that the result forms a harmonious group. 
There is no mre difference in degree of interest between a 
Margaret Morrison woman and an Art school woman than there 
is between an engineer and an Art school man.
When all women students at Carnegie are eligible for mem
bership in recognized sororities and work together to join a na
tional organization, then perhaps some day some of the pres
ent empty girls dormitories will bear the sign of a national

Noel Coward's comedy, The 
Young Idea," which the students in 
tho Department of Drama are pro
ducing in the Little Theater this 
week, gives the excellent enter
tainment usually expected of a 
Coward piece. Being one of the 
earlier plays, it is not quite as 
novel or venturesome in its plot 
as his latest one, but it does have 
the same detached amusement seen 
in most of Mr. Cowards satires on 
social conventions.
The play is, in plot, the conven
tional triangle in one of its varied 
forms. But Mr. Coward, building 
up on this a great deal of light 
witty dialogue and creating char
acters whose actions are extremely 
exaggerated, has skillfully devel
oped a sparkling comedy, particu
larly pleasing because it needs no 
pondering over before digestion. 
With the coming of the two chil
dren of George Brent Into the 
home of Brent and his second wife 
there is a feeling that something 
Is going to happen and as the play 
unfolds, one knows that Brent and 
his former wife will bo reunited. 
This is the expected conclusion of 
tin ploci* hut sufficient sus
pense is created in the character of 
Jennifer to make an audience won
der just what type of a person 
she is.
The play was In large part wellacted. In addition, being a draw
ingroom comedy, it offered the wo
men of the cast the opportunity to 
wear some very artistic costumes, 
and if Janet Patrick was a mean 
hard wife, she was at least a dig
nified one. William Beal as George 
Brent, made a very stoical hus
band, considering that he was con
cealing his love for his first wife 
and that his second one was be
having very badly toward him. 
Audrey Kelley as Gerda, one of 
Brents children, was delightful in 
her naively deliberate misbehav
ior, but George McCalmon as 
Sholto did not make the most of 
his opportunities. It took him un
til he reached Italy to become 
warmed to his part. Jane Prancey 
gave a realistic portrayal of Mrs. 
Hockleberry and Dorothy Devlin 
as Jennifer was the right kind of 
a mother for Gerda and Sholto.' 
Donald Gallagher as Rodney was 
miscast in his role of the lover of 
Cicely._________________________________

One of lifes great surprises was tho quiet manner in which 
repeal of the 18th amendment was observed last Tuesday even
ing. Instead ol! boisterous crowds there wore only a few people 
celebrating publicly. Perhaps it was because 3.2 beer had been 
legalized, or that alcoholic drinks had never been a novelty 
with tho people. It was just the case ol! it being a little easier 
to get a better drink. Instead of walking around tho corner to 
Joes, you went to Pierres and paid the same price and per
haps waited a little longer for your order. What was the use of 
going out when all ono had to do was reach in the closet for 
a drink, a thing that could be done at any time!
Tho disastrous scenes the drys drew with I lie repeal of the 
181,li amondmenl; will probably never appoar, As much as a 
farco as the 18th amendment was, it has dono some good. It 
had made tho people satisfied with government control of liquor 
sales, Under control, drinking will be no move dangerous than 
it has been for the last decade. Saloons havd gone for good. 
In their place stores with liquor for homo consumption, and 
bars soiling drinks until a sot hour, will put a stop to excess 
public drinking.
