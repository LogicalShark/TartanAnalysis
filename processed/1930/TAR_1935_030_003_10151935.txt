"Tlie school, he id, "has in the past tried to allow as much time- as possible before Christmas so that those who wish lo may secure employment in merclijmtile establishments posi offices during the holiday rush.

Mrs. Mary Clark Burnett Suggests Cash Be Given

Magazine Mrs. Mary Clark Burliett, who la the head of the Department if Social Work, wrote an article entitled State Aid For Private Agencies."
Mr6. Burnett aays that Pittsburgh has tbe "doubtful dlstlnc- of having Its own state relief -a very confusing one. T____slon was so evident thatspecial committee was appointed lae tbe state of affairs, neither advocated nor condemned the aid system but gave eeyen principles wHIch would lead-to ia better' irgaulzatioR- and. a.."better, allocation ot.aproprlatlons/v These facts extend to every' . state where the eystem Is in operation, but the implications made are intended mainly 'or Pittsburgh.
The first principle . states that No institution or agency should re*. :elve -state aid unless the- service- it renders is one; for which there, exists a generally recognized need. The second polnt states the . fact that-'nO'1nstitutiot:-sbould-bc given state-aid which does not actually need financial help. -If theaq .two principles would be acted upon, improper and Inefficient,organizations would be disbanded and useful Institutions'would receive the needed
Mrs. Burnetts . third statement 'ery: clearly says that no iQBtltur Ion or agency should-receive state- aid unless.a.coordinated statewide program: will be promoted by. the
services of such agency."v Mrs. Burnett further shows that an institution performing a given service can not be eligible for state aid, and that "no . institution or

Community FundS
OMETIME in the next week you are going to be 
approached by a student volunteer worker ask
ing you to pledge your financial help to tbe Com' 
munity Fund. What will yon do?.
 Before you answer this question it would be well 
to understand just why your money is needed and 
what your, little bit will help to accomplish. 
/.'The Community Fund'was formed to accomplish
. in one drive what Its 82 members achieved by con
tinuous petitioning and door bell ringing. However,
 it is more than a campaign: It is a 365 day-per-year 
organization which is applying efficient methods of 
nance feed administration to a $3,000,000 charity 
program. The financial'goal set by the Fund is de tenuined by a careful budget. This budget is based 
lifton.a thorough study of Ihe budgets of the social 
/agencies which it represents. Thus instead of hap
hazard relief methods we are insured; that our money 
-will be used efficiently in a sound, intelligent program ofvsoclal relief.
' The paid executive staff of the Community Fund 
'Vis 'mall-anil: the Funds management Jies directly 
: with business, and professional leaders who recog niz this as a community job. Its total overhead 
amounts to only 4.5 per cent. - 
V  jo Pittsburgh today there are compJiated domesItic .problems which threaten to disintegrate families, 
warp personalities, and make children dependent 
 upon public welfare. Trained workers from family
 service societies are-skilled in' adjusting these prob lems,, maintaining family, life, and keeping it normal 
/ end; wholesome.
Community' Fund statistics point out that it-costs. 
'aboutten dollars to give a boy or girl trained le^d;-.-ersblp and.supervised recreation. It costs rom $300 
}. i : to ;$B0(|: to ..care for the same child in Correctional 
'.institution.
This, then, is the worlc of the Community Fund 
{to keep children out of such institutions and nourish 
: . them and their parents.
-Carnegie Institute ol Technology has been given 
v the opportunity to lead this great community en. deayor.- Tour pledges, large or small, will assure 
^K'ttsburgh .that .the students of Carnegie -Tech, are' 
 yitally Interested ia the,welfare ot their less for'tnat_fellow-men.
for the conrealence of the^tndent body or the men
tal wellbeing of'the staff. Too often is the entireblamo for this ^condition 'thoughtlewly-'lald to the 
staff of The Thistle. A large portion of the cause 
may be traced directly lo the atudent body itself. 
Individuals .and organizations who fall to meet- the 
deadline for. the taking of pictures, which constitute: 
the most important Item In ttie volume and signifi
cance: of he yearbook, so retard the production pro* 
cess-that It Is impossible for the; book to meet a 
proper date of release. This does more than create 
a dissatisfied market: It endangers the editorial
success of the book inasmuch as the staff, in Its 
effort to quicken production, must execute much of 
Its work without proper'attention to detail; It en
dangers the financial success of the book In that 
many prospective purchasers have- left tbe campus 
by.tlie time It Is off the press..
When an announcement is made by The Thistle 
that pictures are to be taken on or before a certain 
date, it is to tbe Interest of each campus individual 
and organlzaion and to the student body os a whole, 
that the deadline be met This is not offered as an 
excuse for a tardy yearbook, but as a preemption 
wfifoh will'bring a better yearbook":to. the students? 
of Carnegie, on time.
.. Election ChangesI
 T LOOKS as though-there will be a New Dsai in 
.operation .when, freshmen cast their votes for 
;; class officers next Tuesday.'
 >': In the College of Engineering a trial system of 
.-balloting will be In effect. An area will be blocked 
' off and only those casting ballots will be allowed
near the ballot box. This will be unwelcome news 
 for the .'politicians who take such .keen delight in 
.marking other peoples ballots.
!.'> ."Wien Mr. Greiner as chairman of elections an' Bounced the change in procedure, he termed it purely.:experimental/' But why experiment only in the 
^College of Engineering? A record of past voting 
/ ahowH that the women Irave had tiieir share of ballot 
i'box trouble.. Why do.a thing in halves, let tlie woV;'ihen in on the experiment. 
';The new system wont eliminate electioneering,
 vbut.it will,make- It possible to mark a vote without 
:i the. aid of tbe kibitzers, back-slappers, .friends, and 
liigh-pressure artiste.

would install Voting- machines.

Anne Walsh'plunked down the dishes in the

account book in his hand. "Tony," she began, 
Im Bon-y, but I cant pay you today.
"Well, any; time-that Im around will do, Mrs. 
Walsh.
'im afraid you wont have to come around 
any more, Tony. We just'bought an electric re
frigerator. Ill have to pay you in installments 
because we will have to make payments on it, 
too. Will that be all right? Just then the baby 
began to cry, aud she left him without giving

' As Anne fed Joyce she thought about tbe pay* 
ment. on the new electric stove, that was due 
that day. She had some money. If she made 
the payment, however, she could not very well 
get the.new permanent she needed so badly. 
She hadtoget a new pair of shoes, too; perhaps 
they..couidLhe charged at GardB. If the manage^

Coming out of her reverie, Mrs. William Walsh 
scrambled into street clothes,' chucked her 
daughter Joyce into her clothes, and dashed to 
the corner .for a street car. Arriving.atGards 
she calmly executed her plan and left. Lo, the 
poor managerhe had to grit his' teeth and 
watch her walk coolly into the store across the 
street, with three packages that had just been 
charged.
. The manager of Blums was more difficult .to 
bring around.. Anne had to say rather sharply 
. that bards had given her a charge account, and she couldn't see  * * Here she was rewarded, and-half an hour later she was still trying on - dresses, whllie Joyce walled on a nearby chair wlthva saleslady.fussing over her. Finding what . she. wanted,. she; rode home triumphantly withv.ij.- WatH

Bill would :probably groan when he saw the prices; she could always answer by counting the new ties and' shirts he had bought lately (they usually werent cheap). Since he had promised her a new dress for a month, he couldn't very well say anything about it. Her silent soliloquy went on as she: made beds, washed dishes, and tended to Joyce. She had lunch and cleaned the house before she went to the grocery store. On the way there she planned the dinner and refreshments. When she entered, Mr. LauderhofT- looked up and came to wait on her. As he laid the bread on the counter, he paused. Anne recognized the. signs.
Four pork chops, please. As he wrapped them, he began, Mrs. Walsli, about your bill * * *> is it getting large?" asked Anne innocently. *Tli have to see to it. A can of corn and a can of peaches. '

She left . All the time she cooked dinner and * arranged for the' supper later,' she thought bit-' terly of Mr. Lauderhoff. At least ten dollars would have to be taken out of Bills check; and . paid to him- By the time Bill came home she was cross. So tlie two fought during the meal. Bill hlamed Anne, of course. He claimed that if she hadnt run up such bills at other places, the grocery-bill could hare been paid before. Anne  -'retaliated.'- She .was sure it was-BJU'-s-fault the:- bills1 were so high. He spent too much on cl- garets and clothes; he was always
.piled u> and washed the dishes.
Afterwards they wandered amicably down to the drug store on <he corner,, pushing the baby irriage.' Here'tliey talked to Tim, the
- of clgarets and a pack. of bridge cards, said Bill. ..-
"And a bag of.tulats, added Anne.
That .brings your bill to nine dollars and twenty cents, said Tim. - Bill hesitated, and, bringing out a dollar, pushed.it across to him.

She had thought Bill did hot have much moneyi and ytt ne paid a uoiiar 'on something that could have been charged. He had spent-that dollar carelessly: Anne could have-used it.

TARTAN 
SA U C E
By Scotty Charles
N.Y.U. Passes 
For 25-6 Win V vOver Tartans
IT WAS A RATHER DESULTRY TARTAN TEAM that fell before 
aerial onslaught of the Violets of New York University last Satyrjay to tbe morbid anthem' of 26-6. The local lads have been accused of 
onterlDg the fray with a touch ol swollen cranium, being generally fa
vored to take the tUBBle. They started badly and before they knew, they 
ell bad strained Adam's Apples from watching the Knickerbocker passes 
pare tbe way to two touchdowns.
the ONLY TIME THE SKIB09 REALLY STRUTTED was In that 
third period: touehdown-march, during which It, looked like a chance to 
hit the sawdust trail to redemption. However, this rally was nipped 
and the boys slumped back Into their reclining position. The opinion 
has been expressed that they could have won In hand had they been 
fltying the brand of football they showed last week to the Notre Daroi 
squad it half.
MANY EXCUSES HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR THE SLOPPY 
eibibitionsuch as late train, no rest, and playing away. In spite of 
Ihe handicaps, Carnegie has a team this year of high enough caliber to 
take this competition without perspiring if they are really ready for 
them. The Plaid paes defense was about as airtight as an economics 
proi, the Violets completing seven skywards in succession and ending 
up with a record of eleven out ot. fourteen.
THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR TOUCHDOWNS that the Tarians could have scored had It not been for several 'Ifs." .Dropped 
passes and slow lnterference*hlndered the Plaid progress on the offense 
>and made the score Just that much more cockeyed. The blocking was 
poor and the moving Inlorference wae too alow, tlelng up the rabbit 
backs, when they got In the dear. N. Y. U.s line was weak but their 
fast backs eaueed the Pittsburghers plenty of trouble, especially when 
the Sklbos were not crashing through fast enough. -
PITT HAS BEEN DEFEATED by the piebes so there is still some
thing to cbeer for. One of the things that baffles ye scribe Is! the fact 
that the Tartan frosh Visually manage to- hold the Panther yearlings 
erery yearending with'either a victory or a tie;- However,-a year or 
two later the Gold-cladB romp gaily and without effort over th local 
prides and joys. I dunno . . . ; 
THE FROSH PLAYED STRAIGHT FOOTBALL and played It well. 
Davies gave them a bunch of old plays which they executed admirably 
and effectively. They used the old pinners, the Michigan flea flicker 
lateral, the short man play on a kick, In fact, everything but th< 
Statue of Liberty, to trounce the Panthers. '
THE COMING CONTEST WITH TEMPLE promises to go down In 
history as Harpstera Headache. The Owls will come to Pittsburgh 
next week as odds-on favorites to. take the1 Tartans, easily. We have 
seen the Cherry and White-in action and they areplenly. good. Pop 
Warner went lo Temple to turn out a college' with a. football name and 
they are giving him the players who can do it.
Smith's Tosses Swamp 
Plaids; Line Faulty 
On Offensive
New York University , lost no 
time on Saturday fa setting down 
the Tartans from Carnegie, 25-6, to 
even the score for the Sklbo vic
tory last year. Early in the first 
quarter, after Coleman KopBcak 
had punted out on his own 34-yard 
line, the Violet backs turned on 
the beat and rammed over a touch
down. ' it took Quarterback Machlowltz just five plays to cross the 
line, five plunges in which he 
lagged^ the ball the entire distance 
himself. Shortly after, when 
Matelan, who replaced Kopscak 
when the latter was Injured, kicked 
to the Violet 83, the New York team began Its second march. Smith, whose passing kept the Plaid worried all afternoon, did most ot the work In the second scoring threat. He carried ball to Carnegie's 15 In two long jaunts through the lii faded back to whip Klein, who waited in the end s id touched the leather to ground to make the score 12-0. Soon after the second quartor under way, the New Yorkers

Column Against Carnegie Saturday
Pop Warner Has Unbeaten 
Team to Brmg, Against 
Tartan Warriors
Lae Owls have already sewed the game. .The question Is, "Can tne Sklbos stop the Cherry and White?'
It was under these same circumstances that Pop Warner brought 'iiis boys to Pittsburgh two years ago. They were thon slated to win with ease. However, the tables were turned  quickly and Terebus ran wild to help the Pittsburghers chalkup a 25-0 victory. Last year,
through to last winter when they 
defeated In ;the post season' 
Sugar Bowl- game by a strong 
Tulane eleven. This year they 
have gone through four games tin* 
beaten and untied. This is one rec
ord that they do not intend to have 
broken by the Tartans as the Phil
adelphians are murmuring Bose 
Bowl with-the accent on Temple.
Pop Warner is coming to town with victory in mind. Hieboys 'iig and fast and well-coaohed. There -is sure to be an abundance of fancy ball-handling In the Owl
around' a strong fullbackDave S'muckler is the man at the time. His" ability is much publicized, Saturday. will be the opportunity
Since that time. Temple has been beaten only ouce. Their, winning streak started in 1933 and went

leges. The successful- candidates 
wjll automatically become i

tereBts of the students in the col
lege from 'which they.were elected.
In the past few year?, very little Jntereet has been shown In the subject otelections. ' It ie impossible to hold a truly representative elec- - tion in any college unless a majority of the electors are - present at .tbe*-election. The Night student council has often' been criticized ' for -its actions but . the students have failed to remember tbat it was their votes which elected the various Council members. That is why the elections are important . And should be attended by the entire student body.
It is the duty of every Nlgbt student who is registered In a regular course in anv of the three, colleges- to attend the elections and cast his vote. Moreover, it is the duty of every: Night student to elect capa-  ble men and women who have the necessary qualifications, regardless of - race, creed, or political affiliation. - Petty differences should be ^discarded and a candidate should be~ elected on his record only.; If the students bear this thought In mind at the coming elections they mav rest- assured tbat they will . have elected candidates wfoo will best-serve their interests and that the. incoming. Night Student Council -Will be a strong and efficient organization. Only through the cooperation of every Night student can the high standard of the Night Student Council be maintained.

ow, when it comes to a cigarette that 
will suit you... you want to think whether 
its mild, you want to think about the taste
That Chesterfields are milder arid taste better is no 
accident..
The farmer who grows the tobacco, the ware

will tell you that it takes mild, ripe tobaccos to <

In making Chesterfields we use mild ripe home
