Anoni Club Shows 
Student Paintings
The Anoni Club will present an exhibition of paintings in the Exhibition Room of the College of Fine Arts, beginning tomorrow. The Anoni Club is an organization founded for the purpose of presenting for public inspection, student paintings which are not in connection with any school problem. The club is independent of the school, although a majority of its members are students at Carnegie. The officers are Lorin H. Thompson, president, and James D. Demarchi, secretary.
Paintings may be submitted by any student in the Department of Painting and Decorating. A jury consisting of two faculty members, Prof. Russell T. Hyde and Mr. Samuel Rosenberg, and two students, Lorin H. Thompson and James D. Demarchi, will pass judgment on the paintings and select those to be exhibited. At the conclusion of the exhibit, another jury, as yet unnamed, will choose the outstanding pieces of work; these will be sent on a traveling exhibit. A press view was held Monday, October 17.The Anoni Club has done much to promote the Depression Art Show on the lawn of the Hotel Schenley.

resent Discoveries At 
Chemists Meeling 
In Cleveland
Dr. J. C. Warner, assistant pro- 088,01 of Chemistry, and Mr. Leon- ird C. Flowers, instructor in draw- ng and descriptive geometry, represented Carnegie at a recent meeting of the Electro-chemical pocioty held at Cleveland, Ohio, 
September 23, where they disclosed discoveries made as a result of extensive experimentation with nickel plating solutions.Nickel plating solutions are vital to the industrial world today, be
cause they are used to build up a base for chromium plate. Plated cliromium, possesing a highly polished metallic luster and a high resistance to corrosion, is used for motor car trimmings, domestic utensils, golf clubs, and other articles in common use. It was found that the nickel-plate undercoating eliminated porousity, which 
had caused the chromium plate to scale off.
It has been the practise in the nickel plating industry to conduct the plating process in a cold, slightly acid solution, using a low current density. The results were satisfactory, but slow. With -the ever-increasing demand for chromium plate, the necessity for a speedier process became evident.Dr. Warner and Mr. Flowers are experimenting at the present time with a solution in which the acidity has been increased. This solu
tion, was developed in the General Motorss laboratories by a scientist there. However it can not be used in the plating of deep orevices.In the Carnegie investigation it 
as found that when a high tem- srature, about 50 degrees was com- -ed with a high current density, throwing power of the solu- was greatly increased..t the present time, Dr. Warner Mr. Flowers are directing r investigation toward an in- use in the throwing power of plating solution now in use, introducing it into other sub- nces.

Professor Robert B. Leighou, 
head of the Department of Indus
trial Science at Carnegie, has 
been appointed director of the 
Summer Session by Dr. Thomas

His subject, Five Years of the Typotlietae Foundation at Carnegie Institute of Technology, will summarize the progress in (he Department o Printing at Carnegie,The United Typotlietae of America has contributed $22,500 a year to Carnegie as the only American college giving instruction in printing. Professor Gustafson will show that the enrollment of printing students for the past five years has been approximately twice that of the preceding five year period. The average number of graduates from the department for the years 1927-1932 has grown from 5.0 to 19.2 per year.Among the other speakers at the convention is Mr. Fred J.

The production session will be under the direction of William D. Hall 21, a graduate of the Department of Printing.
Drama Dept. Entertains 
Nixon Players And 
New Students
By ROY Ml NET
I'd love to. be a student here in your Drama Department! said 
Miss Helen Flint, one of the stars in the Theater Guilds production, The Pure in Heart, which played at the Nixon last week. If only I 
could spare the four years from my professional career. To me, its so wonderful that your stu
dents are made to study every phase of the theatrical business. 
You see, so much is lost by those who start out professionally 
which I did through the Ziegfield Follies and then in stockbecause 
they never have the opportunity or the time to get the broad train
ing you give here. There are so many interesting things to know about electricity, and lighting, 
and scene designing, and costume making, and directingso many 
things that are really a part of the theater and which add so much to an actors understanding. Then, too, Id like to write, and Id like 
to be in a school atmosphere.
And you have the most fascin
ating group of students. I could just feel their enthusiasm! Witn 
such a love of the theater, and with such a charming and beautiful atmosphere in which to work well, they certainly ought to be 
successful.
Your lovely Little Theater, why just peeping into it made me want to dash right up onto-the 
platform and do a monologue! And Im positively envious of the mar* velous costumes you have in the Poel and in the Mansfield collections.Miss Flint and eight other prom
inent members of the Guild company were guests at a . reception 
and tea given in the College of Fine Arts at 4:30 on Friday afternoon for the new students in the Department of Drama. Over a hundred personsguests, faculty .members, and studentsenjoyed 
the intimate atmosphere created by curtaining the windows in the Round-Table Room and lighting it only with tall candles. Tea, sandwiches, cookies, cakes, and mints were served, thereby adding the 
final element to one of the most successful and most enjoyable social affairs ever held T>y the department. It is reported that other similar social events will be held 
throughout the year, not only to provide entertainment, but to af
ford drama students the opportunities for becoming acquainted in professional circles and with professional viewpoints.Edward F. Kelly and Mary Hamilton, president and secretary of 
the Department of Drama, respectively, were in charge of arrangements. Miss Elizabeth M. Schrader, Instructor in Stage .Costume, 
acted as hostess. The reception 
committee was composed of Janet W. Feather, Mary E. Rowles, Janet 
Patrick, Eloise M. Campbell, BoydS. Crawford, John M. Wilkoff, Ray
mond M. Neyhart, George A. Mc- Calmon, and William G. Beal. The refreshments were prepared by Marcia E. Leety, Dorothy Neu
mann, Patti Littell, Viola Sayles, Vernon Crane, Robert H. Gill, and Edward J. Palkot.
Studio Performances Will Be 
Organized And Supervised 
By Directors
By ROY MINET
Presenting a bill of three one- act plays in its Studio Theater in the Union at 3:30 Friday afternoon, the Department of Drama in
augurates a series of fifteen scheduled programs which will 
provide Carnegie 1 students and other interested persons .with ail unusual opportunity to see the pro
ductions of nearly sixty one-act 
plays. Tickets are not required for admission.
Professor Hickman, who is supervising Fridays program, has selected Maraine Hay thorn to direct Janet W. Feather, John G. Dawson, and Barry Mulligan in a comedy; Edward F. Kelly to direct Mary E. Rowles, William G. Behrse, Robert H. Gill, Donald J. Gallagher, and Edward J. Palkot in a tragedy; and Jean Dahl to direct Audrey L. Kelley, I. Jean Cowan, William G. Beal, Edward V. I-Iarmle, and William G. Bales in a farce.
In using a secondary stage. Carnegie is in step with the lead
ers among schools and theaters everywhere. Russias prominent 
Moscow Art Theater, the famous Abbey'Theater of Dublin, our own Yale Theater, Pasadena Playhouse, and Goodman Theater use a similar arrangement for experimental productions.
During the past twenty years many great one-act plays have been written. This shorter drama is an independent art form, worth while and enduring in itself; yet in the professional field it is used very infrequently. Twenty-five years ago it was the custon in London to use a one-act play as a 
curtain raiser, but even this practice lias died out. As a consequence, the performances of these modern one-act plays in the little theater on the top floor of the Administration Building will be especially important and significant.
Each studio performance will be organized and supervised by a faculty director, but all productions will be essentially informal and without elaborate settings. Through these matinees, student directors working under the supervision of Professors Chester M. Wallace and E. W. Hickman will 
secure practice in the staging of plays, student actors will gain valuable training, and student stage managers will secure additional technical experience.

Tau Beta Pi Holds 
National Convention
The annual convention of Tau Beta Pi, national engineering honorary fraternity, was held at Washington, D. C., on October 13, 14, and 15. William J. Burns 33, a student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, attended the convention as a delegate of the local chapter. Discussing and voting on the petitions of the University of Southern California and Marquette University was one of the main issues before the convening engineers. Much business of interest to the local chapters and to engineers in general was also discussed.
Tartan To Sponsor Straw 
Vote; Students And Faculty 
Will Ballot In Classrooms
By LAWRENCE C. CARD
The next general assembly which 
is under the direction of Delta 
Skull, junior class honorary, is to 
be held at the Carnegie Music 
Hall on Tuesday, October 25, the 
date having been changed from 
November 1 on account of the 
Tartan Presidential Poll.
The program, which is under the 
i supervision of a committee con
sisting of Samuel C. Wicks, chair
man; Charles F. Slater, Charles E. Davis, and Libbus Lewis, is to be 
quite extensive, consisting of a 
speaker and musical entertain
ment.
The committee is trying to ob
tain a prominent political writer 
from one of the Pittsburgh daily 
papers who will talk on the presi
dential platforms of the Republi
can, Democrat, and Socialist par
ties. The purpose of the talk is 
to set forth the aims of the parties 
in a non-partisan manner in or
der that students may cast a se
rious, unbiased vote at the Tartan 
Poll which is to be held on Wed
nesday, October 26.
The musical entertainment will 
be furnished by Robert L. Maurer 
of the Department of Drama, who 
plays a theremin, an instrument 
known as the electro-voice. (Mr. 
Maurer will be accompanied by 
Mr. Edward H. Jolie, who is an 
outstanding organist in the music 
department.) Mr. Maurer has had a great deal of experience playing the theremin and claims the intercollegiate championship. He has played with prominent dance orchestras in Cleveland and broad- cast with the Rennselaer Symphony. Orchestra over WHAE, Troy, New York.The theremin, as an instrument, is very interesting because it. has 
no visible means of producing music such as keys or strings. It is actuated by moving the liiinds at varying distances from two metal rods. One hand controls the volume of the sound and the other produces the pitch but neither touches the instrument. There are about two hundred and fifty 
llieremins but only a few are actually in use.

THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
As election day draws nearer we find nearly every one of political importance either making a speech or taking a poll. According to the Literary Digest Poll and the Hearst Poll, Roosevelt is leading by a small, yet comfortable margin. However, not enough 
time has elapsed since Hoovers first campaign speech to see its effect on these straw votes. Another thing to be taken into consideration is the fact that a great number of Hoover supporters can not be reached through the above mentioned mediums. In a great many states where Roosevelt has been winning a majority of straw votes the Republican registration has been leading that of the Democrats at the pools. As things stand at the present it is still anybodys election.A great many interesting letters are received by the conductors of straw votes, most of which seem to indicate* that the individual is more interested this year in his welfare than in the balljdioo of political speakers. As a result of this, I again predict the following: a large spite or protest vote for Norman Thomas, who is leading the minor candidates by a large margin; a decline in the total balloting due to poll taxes in many states; and general disgust at the major party platforms by 110 small number of individuals.While on the way to Cleveland to make a campaign address last
Saturday, Herbert Hoover made eight platform speeches. He seems to have forgotten that his personal campaign was to be limited to three speeches. No doubt the extreme exuberance of FranklinD. Roosevelt, the candidate who seemss to be riding pretty far on a big smile, has thrown a scare into the sedate occupant of the White House. Perhaps the unemployment situation has become so tense that Hoover looks toward 
November 8 with little ease of mind.Out in the middle west, where all that the farmers have left is a mail order catalogue and a vote, Odgen Mills is taking care of that vote by tearing Roosevelts
speeches and promises to pieces. In fact he is doing such a good 
job that Franklin D. himself is going to make another trip into this territory which has recently and effectively been injected with a strong dose of Republicanism.Hanford McNider, who was a contender for the Republican nomination, is doing his share in mak- this his fellow legionnaires lean toward Hoover. On the other hand Roosevelt's allies have been banding together. The Democratic New' York State convention forced A1 Smith to shift his support to Roosevelt rather than split the party. The Democrats hailed this reconciliation as significant as did 
the Republicans the endorsement

A "silence period of three days beginning at midnight on Sunday 
evening, November 7, and ending at 4:30 on Wednesday afternoon, 
November 10, will terminate the 
rushing season. The sororities write bids to the girls they wish to pledge. If a bid is not answered by the rusliee before 4:30 on Wednesday, November 10, it will not be accepted until -the end of a twomonth period. During the period of silence there shall be no communication of any kind between 
rusliee and sorority members.Intersorority Council is com
posed of the four recognized social sororities on the Carnegie campus. Tligse are: Alpha Kappa Psi,
Gamma Gamma Gamma, Beta Pij and Beta Tau Lambda.Evelyn Gamble 34, a member of 
Beta Tau Lambda, is chairman of 
the committee for the Intersorority tea. The members of her committee are: Margaret Varner 35,Alpha Kappa Psi; Betty J. OToole

Inasmuch as interest in the com
ing Presidential election has been 
running high at Carnegie, the Tar
tan has decided to sponsor a straw 
vote among the students and fac
ulty. The poll will be held on 
Wednesday, October 26, in the 
class rooms during the 9:30-10:30 
hour in co-operation with the ad
ministration. That hour was se
lected as the majority of the students are in classes at that time. By means of the class room poll a large percentage of the students and faculty will vote and thereby allow an accurate reckoning of which presidential candidate Carnegie leans toward. The ballots will not only record the name of the candidate preferred but also the sex and college of the voter. The results will be printed the following week.In conjunction with the straw vote, Delta Skull plans an assembly on Tuesday, October 25, the day before the poll, which will he 
addressed by one of the major political writers in the Pittsburgh district. It is hoped that many of the students will avail themselves of the opportunity to hear a clearcut summary of the political situation before they vote. A definite
Roosevelt Speaks 
At Forbes Field
Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate for Pres- dent, will make one of the major speeches of his second campaign tour before a mass meeling at Forbes Field tomorrow night. His Pennsylvania campaign headquarters have not announced the subject of the speech, but re* port that he will not speak about the1 bonus.

announcement of the speaker and the place of the assembly will be posted 011 the bulletin boards it the plans are completed.Straw votes taken at other colleges indicate many interesting items. At. Antioch College, in Ohio, Norman Thomas polled the greatest number of votes, leading Hoover by three ballots and al
most trebling the vote alloted to Roosevelt, while at University of Pittsburgh, in a poll taken during registration, Roosevelt led by a large majority. The Literary Digest poll, which is not yet complete, showed that Roosevelt started out with a large lead but Hoover has been gradually gaining on him during the last few weeks. The Hearst Newspaper Poll has been showing results which differ very little from those of the Literary Digest. Since all of these straw votes were taken before the Hoover campaign was fully under way no estimate can be made from them of the possible outcome o the Tartan Poll.
Art Students Enter 
Beaux Arts Contest
Eight students from the Department of Sculpture have completed trials for this semesters first Beaux Arts Institute of Design problem. These problems, clay sketches of synagogue doors, will be judged on November 7 at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York City.The students who submitted de

they might, every bit of. strategy 
they could think of seemed to go 
wrong, for the Panthers managed 
to turn two Tartan errors into 
touchdowns and thus givo them 
the verdict, 12 to nix.
For a while it looked as if the 
Plaids crippled squad might sur
prise everyone, including them
selves, and make a truly miserable 
afternoon for the cubs from across 
the park. The tide turned, how
ever, late in the first period when 
Pitt recovered a fumble on the 
Carnegie 20-yard stripe and pro
ceeded to pass and plunge its way 
for the initial score.Pitts second and last tally came just before the final whistle when an alert end smothered a last desperate Skibo pass deep in Tech territory and ran IS yards for a touchdown. Both Pitts tries for extra points were blocked.Carnegies young hopefuls twice had the Panther hanging on for its life, once in the third quarter and once in the final stanza. The first 
time, a series of passes placed the oval on the seven-yard mark, but a fumble intervened and robbed the Plebes of their best opportunity to score. Again in the fourth period, the Big Dogs charges advanced to within striking distance of the goal only to lose it by a penalty.The showing of the plebes, in spite of defeat, was truly remarkable. Injuries have crept in regularly all season, and the shortage of material itself has handicapped the coaching staff from the first. Spisak, brother of the Varsitys star broken field runner, played sensational ball all the way through. His passing was amazingly accurate, and he was considerably aided by having an end, Schmidt, who apparently had glue on his hands, to catch them.
WHAT A WHALE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENCE ONE POINT MAKES! 
Usually one point in a football game means little, but one point in 
Saturdays conflict would have meant victory. However, that one point 
was missing and the game ended in a 6-6 deadlock. Once again the 
Prexies from little Washington brought with them the well known Jinx, 
which has been a thorn in the side of the Tartans for many years, and 
succeeded in marring Carnegies record for the first time this season. In the first quarter it looked as if the Plaid attack was at last going to function properly, when, despite several serious penalties, the Skibos marched up the field for a touchdown. The line was making huge holes for the ball carriers and the interference was better than anything we have seen this year. .On two beautiful runs George Kavel succeeded in planting the old pigskin over the final chalk mark for what proved to be Carnegies only score, but which at the time looked to be just the first of a series of touchdowns. But the Prexies were not disheartened, in fact they went back in there more determined than ever to even the score which they did before the half was over. In the second half neither team had much advantage over the other one; the Tartans getting down to their opponents twenty-yard line early In the last quarter, but that was the closest they got to the W. & J. goal line.
FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THAT COACH HANK DAY HAD A VERY STRONG TEAM out there on the field and that it was do disgrace for the Tartan's to come off the field with a tie score. The Presidents had a big and veteran line; it outweighed the Plaid forward wall eight pounds to a man and their backfield had a similar weight advantage. In addition to this they had strong supply of good reserve material which Hank Day used frequently throughout the contest. The visitors lone tally came in the second quarter immediately after several substitutions had been made in the Tartan line which seemed to materially weaken the defensive ability of the forward wall, and before the regulars could be rushed back into the game W. & J., with the aid of Deacle, a powerful fullback, succeeded in battering their way down 
the field for a touchdown.The hidden ball offense of W. & J. was interesting to watch and was quite effective in the first few minutes, but after the first half the Plaid linesmen succeeded in breaking up many of the plays before they got started. It was a clever trick, that of painting the ball white. It. would have been much more difilcclt to have detected the ball carrier if he had been toting the ordinary brown ball.
THE GALLOPING IRISH ARE GALLOPING AGAIN, seemingly with more vigor than ever before, and have already given warning that they are out for National honors once more. The team which happens to be the opponent of that Notre Dame Outfit any time this year is going to have its hands full and that goes for our gallant Tartans next week. The annual Scotch-lrish conflict which comes about Saturday out in South Bend has become one of the seasons football classics and this year it will be no exception. So far the Plaid team has not shown the strength of teams of 1926, 1928, or 1930, but past experiences have shown that pre-game dope means little in this conflict. Almost anything can happen. To the Tartans goes the credit of being the first team to ever conquer Notre Dame on their own stamping grounds and followers of the Irish have not yet forgotten the jubilation of that 27-7 defeat, and they are not apt to for some time to come. In addition 
to that Coach Hunk Anderson remembers a certain Saturday in November back in 1926 when he brought his team to Pittsburgh, a previously undefeated team, and took them back to Knute Rockne severely trounced by a 19-0 score. It will take him quite a while to forget the passing and kicking of Harpster, the plunging of Letzeler, the sweeping end runs of Bill Donahoe, or in '28, the end around plays of Rosensweig, and the tearing apart of his line by Karcis and Letzeler. Yes, sir, those Irish mentors are still after revenge.

It will be the canny Scotch 
against the Fighting Irishdespite 
the Carideos, Schwartzes and 
Yarrs who annually grace the latters football horizonwhen Car
negie invades South Bend this Sat
urday for its perennial Notre Dame encounter. The prominence and prestige which comes from beating Notre Dame, plus the natural rivalry existing between the two schools, has served to produce a game second only in importance in Carnegie football realms to the Pitt battle.As the W. & J. melee produces its jinx, and the Pitt contest provides that supreme ultimatum, so does the Notre Dame-Tech game usually prove the most spectacular. Ever since football relations began back in 1922, the Tartan-Irish meetings have seldom failed to produce Merriwell results.For example, in 24, when Carnegie stopped dead the running attack of the famed Four Horsemen and matched the visitors point for point in the 13-13 first half. It was only Rocknes un- fathonable aerial game which gave his charges a 40-19 victory and sent the on-lookers home with that what-a-game feeling. And those who saw it can ever forget that cold, dreary, November afternoon when an inspired band of Tartan warriors rocked the sports world with a decisive 19-0 victory over an unbeaten Irish aggregationthe game of which Wally Steffen later said, It wasnt an upset, it was a set-upreferring to the courage and ability that his boys displayed 
that day for Carnegie.And then in '28, Carnegies mightiest machine, headed for the National championship under the All-American leadership of Howard Harpster, invaded South Bend and 
handed the Irish her first home defeat in 24 years. Scoring three 
plays after the kickoff, coming back a few minutes later with another tally, and leading 20-0 at the half, that great Tartan football juggernaut went on to win by a 27-7 score before a rain-soaked crowd of 35,000 wildly excited spectators.Sandwiched in between these epoch-making victories came losses, but the most crushing and disappointing of all was the 21-6 defeat our potentially great 1930 aggregation received. A powerful Notre Dame combine which later won the National laurels, "pointed for the Carnegie encounter and could not bo denied.
For those who believe in it, this W. & J. football jinx is still with us. And in its shadow the latest chapter of Carnegie-Washington and Jefferson gridiron history was written last Saturday, in a game that started out like a whirlwind and ended up in a 6-6 gentle breeze.Hardly had the spectators settled in their seats when the Tartans, with Kavel carrying the ball, tore off in succession two perfectly executed plays which netted 64 
yards and a touchdown. The Tartan offense had begun to click and Carnegie supporters at last breathed a sigh of relief. Even when another perfect playthis time a passfailed to score, Tartan supremacy reigned so high that little doubt of the outcome remained in the minds of those who watched. Then suddenly, as though some magic wand was waved, the Big Red team lost its scoringstride and was forced to battle oneven terms for the remainder of the contest.
The plays preceding the Skibo score were indeed a revelation to watch. With the ball on its own 36-yard line, the Carnegie offense engineered Capt. Kavel into the clear and past all except the W. & J. safety who downed George on the 30. McCurdy went out ofbounds for no gain and then Kavel, on the same play as previousstepped through a yawning gap in the line, cut back and raced the 30 yards behind perfect interfer- ference to score. Stewarts kick for point was wide but at this 
juncture the miscue seemed of little importance.In the second quarter the Presidents put on a scoring drive themselves which started on the Tartan 48 yard stripe and concluded when 
Fullback Bob Deacle bucked his way over the final marker for a 
6-pointer. The Skibo forwards saved the day by blocking Fifes try for point.
Carnegies only other scoring threat ended on the W. & J. 21- yard in the third period. The Presidents quickly kicked out of danger and kicked so well that the ball bounded clear down to the Plaid 2-yard line and practically 
ended Carnegies scoring hopes.For the Tartans Co-Captain Kavel and Red Jones stood out. Kavel was the only consistent ground-gainer of the contest, while Jones played a bang-up defensive game at center and was quick in diagnosing and frustrating many of Wash-Jeff's deceptive advances.After watching the much-disThe Tartan Cross Country team 
opens the season next Saturday

The course will be three and onelialf miles long over flat territory, 
a direct contrast to our own hilly

been stressing speed, and last Fri
day time trials were held. As a 
result of the trials Bob Schell, 
Shorey Allan, Emil Stankey, Roger 
Burke, H. Neff, and W. Neff were 
chosen to make the trip.

ONLY TWENTY-FOUR LETTERMEN ARE BACK ON THE IRISH SQUAD THIS YEAR and out of a small squad of 110 men, the Notre Dame coach is spending many a sleepless night wondering where he can find a suitable team to put on the field. He mourns the loss of Marcliy Swartz, Tommy Yarr, Nordy Hoffman, and Dick Mahony and wonders what he will do to replace them. Yes sir, we agree with Hunk that ho is in a tight spot. After the first two games only one hundred and thirty some odd points- have been scored against their opponents and an attitude of gloom prevails on the Notre Dame campus.
ONCE MORE THE TARTANS WILL BE OUTWEIGHED AT THE LINE, AND EVEN IN THE BACKFIELD, because the total weight of the Irish forward wall is 1,335 pounds which makes an average of over 190 pounds per man. The first team backfield will average about 178 pounds and when the substitutes begin rolling on the field the weight will not decrease one bit. The two heaviest men on the line are the two tackles, Krause and Kurth, the former weighing 212 pounds and the latter 204. The lightest man on the line is Captain Paul Host who 
tips the beams around 175. The backfield will consist of four nice 
Irishmen who answer to the names of Jaskwhlch, Lukats, Brancheau, and MeJInkovlch. And if anything happens to them Koken, Sheeketski, and Banas arc right on the bench waiting to be called upon. Steve BanaB, who was out of the lineup most of last year because of an In-' jury, has been playing a great game so far this year and may get the call over the veteran Melinkovich. Lukats, at the left halfback post, has been making some brilliant runs which would have been of credit to the great Swartz himself. Well, it is going to be a good game, because no matter what the odds are the Tartans always make a great showing against Notre Dame.
AS THE SEASON PROGRESSES IT LOOKS AS IF THE PLAID TEAM is going to have a tough time of It during the remainder of their schedule. The old Pitt Panther journeyed up to the Hudson river and trimmed the great Army 18-13. Aiid Notre Dame had an easy time with Drake in trouncing them 62-0. Georgetown sauntered to NeAv York only to take a sound drubbing from the violet team from New York University. And on Friday night Temple really got started and defeated the strong Bucltnell team 13-0.

THE TARTAN PLEBES LOST THEIR FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON ON SATURDAY when they met defeat at the hands of the Pitt Frosh by the score of 12-0. The game itself was much closer than the score would indicate. Pitt scored their first touchdown in the first quarter when they recovered a fumble on the Plebes 15-yard line. Twice in the second half the Skibo freshmen were up to the 15-yard line only to lose the chance to score, once by a fumble and next by a penalty. Pitt scored their second touchdown when Vaughn intercepted a pass in the last minute of play and ran twenty yards for a touchdown. The highlights of the game were the passing of Spisak, the catching of passes by Schmidt, and the excellent defensive work of Trbovich, Spencer and Moore.______________________________________

Lockers Puzzle 
To Old And New 
Students Alike
Well, the call is issued for 
-yorkers for that big army of the -Tight Student Council. Guess this 
s as important as any other kind 'f work, so I'll bet the registration ne composed of those who wish > enter their names will be a rep- .tentative one. The Council 
ems to secure quite a number I willing workers. There must be omething fascinating about the 
'ork and council to attract the 
tght students. I wonder if there ould be any place for an Idle iglit StudentI can't do much ex- ept possibly loaf on the job, es* 
eeially after such assignments as i have received during the past week.
Speaking of assignments brings ie to the all important question of 
ext books. Now, that is a point, specially when one considers that he cost of tuition still remains the ame and all the extra money one  is used up by buying gasoline 
r the car, if you happen to be so ifortunate as to own one; the rtunate ones still use the street irs. The question of the text book is all important in that even 
though you may have a friend who jsed such and such a book five /ears ago and he has volunteered :o let you use this book for your class, you are due for a sad awakening because the book has been 
:hanged, or some other author has >een substitutedTheres an effort 
i economize vanquished. The day . ay be saved, however, if one is fortunate enough to be able to secure books from one Pillsbury (not flour) who has a number of used books for sale. I need several and am going to try my luck with Pillsbury.
I mentioned the unfortunate 
ones who drive cars, and well I should. Did you ever ride in a par to the campus, either your own, or some other persons, and note the large spaces available for parking? There you have the point. Driving around with no 
place to park is an interesting game at Carnegie especially between the hours of 6:30 and 8:30 p. m any night during the week. Yes, the fortunate ones are really 
those who park their troubles with the street cars after they arrive at the "Cut.
And, believe it or not, as I came 
upon the campus last week I noticed one of the beacons stationed at one of the prohibited places flashing a green light. I rubbed my eyes to ascertain if I was seeing double, or whether it was the efiection from Morewood avenue it the Cut. No, I saw right. Tho 1 ight really flashed green in front )f Langley Lab. Now this is a bit mcouraging as eventually we may 
lave through traffic in this part of he campus.
A novel way to settle the park <ng question at Carnegie would be to establish a system as has been 
put into practice at Amherst College. The plan is to make the drWlng of a car a privilege. This privilege would depend upon tho 
grades secured by the students. Scholastic average of 75 per cent or bettor is essential in order to seen ro the right to drive a car at Amherst. The stand is taken that motor cars are, in general, a dis- tracton rather than an adjunct to 
the primary purpose for which tho students attend Amherst. Gee, wouldnt that system be fine 
Carnegie. You could tell at fiance all those who made a grade or 75 per cent or better. Guess I 
better park myself on the street cars and secure a permanent pass, because I am sure to go below 75 per cent. Wonder what those night students would do who come from Greensburg, Walkerville, Goblers Knobb, Bridgeville, Alli
ance, and the other distant places. Guess we wont have such a system at Carnegie. Ill bet the night 
students will agree that those in authority at Amherst are wrong when it comes to a distraction especially when driving a car is the only means of getting to the camp' us.
Were you able to find your class rooms? This used to be a big factor when the night students first came out. I didnt notice so many running around as usual so 
pose that the rooms are easy find. In the good old days, how 
ever, many an hours time was spent in finding out that such and such a room was anywhere except where you thought it was. Thanks 
to those who were responsible in rePfisigning numbers.
hings are getting into full ig with the first week of school 
r and all settling down for tho rs work of study and all that 3 with it. It is good to note tho nber of students who are back 1 the instructors who come out 
lit after night to lend a hand In instruction of the night studs. Wo do have a wonderful .ool and an excellent corps of inuctors to guide us and I take hat off to them, even if I dont ee with them all the time,
Aside from the renewing of old 
acquaintances and making new 
ones, the first night of classes in 
the Arts School is ironically known 
to P. and D. students os a night of 
experimentation.
It is generally believed by cer
tain classes that people with artis
tic leanings have no mechanical 
instincts. The disciples of this 
unaltruistlc theory would no doubt 
have rejoiced with diabolical satis
faction, had any of them been 
present in the P. and D. corridor 
as the new contingent of prospective night art students bore down 
ruthlessly, but with little success, 
on the tricky narrow combination 
lockers assigned to them for stor
ing their drawing and painting 
paraphernalia.
An impartial observer, however, 
would have had nothing but praise 
and admiration for these frantic young men and women, who with rare display of perseverance made repeated efforts to unravel those perplexing combinations.Even veteran locker openers with many years of experience on this particular variety failed embarrassingly on many occasions as good samaritans. It is obvious that the ranks of the safe-cracking profession will never be recruited from art students.Experience has shown that tho best way to open one of these obstinate contraptions is to pound upon it incessantly with the bare fists until the mind becomes dazed and one loses all sense of animation. Then while in this lackadaisical trance, go through tho prescribed combination on the dial, and the locker opens as if by occult magic.It is estimated that approximately three weeks of this practice is necessary before one can acquire that essential mechanical acumen that will enable him eventually to open his locker on first try and thereby arrive at class on time. ,

Hold Smoker In Union Sat. Evening
The annual election smoker of 
the Night College of Engineering 
will be held in the Union Saturday 
night, October 22. It will be noted 
that the location is the Union, on 
the third floor of the Administra
tion Building, and not in the 
Gymnasium, as. announced in the 
social calendar. The arrangements 
for holding the affair in the Gym
nasium were only tentative, and 
the final plans include the use of 
the Union, which is better adapted 
to the purpose.
Notwithstanding the depression, 
the officers promise the usual good 
time for those attending, and it is whispered about that the affair will be in no way inferior to the smokers of the past. Anyone who can possibly arrange to attend should do so, if for no other reason than to cast their vote in the election of officers for the present year. Aside from the interest to be found in the election, the entertainment provided will make it well worth while to attend. Iu keeping with the times, a free lunch will be served, which is another inducement for attending. 
Free lunches are scarce these days.Admission will be only upon presentation of your registration card, no other ticket or pass being necessary or acceptable.As points towards an insignia will be awarded for work done, engineers who are interested in obtaining part of the points 'which must be earned at functions of their own college, in addition to those earned at Student Council 
events, are requested to come to the Union at six o'clock, or a little earlier, in order to assist with preparations foi the affair. Lets have a good turnout.
Niglit Handbooks 
Still Available
Experiments conducted at Purdue University over a period of two years to determine the effect of class size upon student learning, effort, and attitude toward instruc
tor and toward teaching procedure, reveal that size of class is not a significant variable in the achievement of students.Many other popular delusions regarding the effectiveness of mass education have been found to be wrong and baseless as the result of three different types of experiments with classes ranging in size from seventeen to fifty-four students.
It was found that student attitude in the small classes unanimously favor the small class and also that student attitude as measured by ratings of the Instructors are not greatly effected by class size.
Class size does not. significantly affect the average amount of time spent in preparation as reported by students in the experiment.During the survey it was developed that the cost of instruction may he significantly reduced and 
the effectiveness of the instructors Increased without affecting the student's achievements. This could he done without increasing the burden upon the instructor by having some of the paper work done by competent students.
Although many students who did not obtain copies of the night student handbook at registration 
came to the Night Student Council office and received them, there are still many who have not taken 
advantage of the offer made in the previous issues of the Tartan on this page. This should not be, for the handbook is a really valuable aid to any student, in that it an

Making telephone equipment presents many 
an interesting problem to the engineers of Western 
Electricmanufacturer for the Bell System.
A case in point is the drying of telephone cable 
before putting on the protective lead sheath. This 
step is of utmost importance, for the tiny copper 
wires cannot carry your voice properly unless their 
paper insulation is thoroughly dried. To this end, 
Western Electric engineers devised special drying 
ovens in which the air is thirty times drier than 
desert air!
The same ingenuity and thoroughness go into 
every step of making cable, telephones, switch
boards and many other kinds of telephone equip. ment. The dependable apparatus that results is 
one reason why Bell System service is dependable.

No doubt many night students who drive to school have already exhausted their vocabulary as they hunted a very elusive parking space. Due to a somewhat limited parking area and to certain parking regulations with which some students are not familiar the Tartan publishes, herewith the regulations in force on and around the campus. The students are asked to obey these rules so that no misunderstandings may occur.
No pa'fking is permitted on the Industries side of the drive parelleling Industries and Langley Lab. However, right angle to the curb parking is permitted on the Park side of this drive. Machines should be parked with the rear to the embankment. They should also be parked reasonably close together so that as large a number as possible can be accommodated.
No parking is permitted on the Quadranglenor between barriers on this drive at any time. This rule must be observed.No parking is permitted on the drive between the Fine Arts Building and Langley Lab.Parking is permitted on both sides of Woodlawn avenue, and on 
both sides of the drive between Fine Arts Building and the Gymnasium. Driveways, however, are to be kept clear.In order to accommodate as 
many cars as possible, please park your car as near as possible to the one next to you. This will eliminate much waste space. Obeying all the above regulations will work to everybodys advantage. Please do your part.

Smoker Report At Union
Night engineers who are desirous of earning points to be applied towards the insignia award will report at the Union Saturday evening, October 22, to assist in pre
paring for the smoker to be held that evening. The time for gathering has been set for six oclock. 
As the smoker will not begin until about half past eight there should be ample time for all preparations if the turnout of workers is as good as it lias been in the past.
At the University of Melbourne, Australia, the men are asserting their superiority again. They have taken up knitting as a protest against the coeds who have adopted . football as one of their major sports.
Military Ball Number 
Of Puppet Out Oct. 25
The next issue of the Carnegie Tech Puppet will appear on Tuesday, October 25. This will be the 
Military Ball Number and judging from the good start which .Puppet made this year, this one should be a sell-out. The price per copy is only ten cents and is a real bargain for a college humorous magazine. See the night salesman who is soliciting your order for your copy.
Night Sales Staff Of 
Puppet Being Organized
All night students Interested in 
selling Puppet, the college humor
ous magazine, should send in their 
name and address to E. McDon
ald, box 137 C. I. T. Post Office, or leave the Information at the Night Student Council Office, Room 144-C Industries Building. Ten issues of the magazine are published during the college year. The numbers sell for ten cents per copy. Stu
dents interested should send in their name at once so that no time will be lost in selling the remaining numbers.
A new system of grading Is In 
practice at the University of California. An objective exam is given at the end of four weeks, and those students making a percentage of 95% or better and having an A average in class work will be released from the course. But thats not all. A refund of $5 on tho course will.be given. It seems to pay to study.
Talking from the sky 
on a beam of light
'THE huge U. S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles, is roaring 
-* above the General Electric Research Laboratory at Sche
nectady. On board the airship, an almost invisible beam of 
light is aimed at a 24-inch mirror-target a half-mile below. 
The mirror, turning as it follows the dirigibles course, catches 
the slender beam. Voices transformed into electric impulses 
in the airship are carried to the mirror by light waves. A 
photoelectric cell picks up these waves and they are recon
verted into sound, which is broadcast to the world by radio. 
A "voice on the air," with a "voice from the air"the offi

is taking place. One millionth of a wattgenerated from the 
blast of a police whistle in the dirigibleis transmitted to 
the ground on the beam of light and to a Thyratron tube. 
The tube magnifies the whistle energy 50,000,000,000,000 
times to operate the switches that start the transmitter, five 
miles away.(Insert) John Bellamy Taylor, General Electric research engineer, operating projecting apparatus

future will demonstrate its commercial value. Elec

electrical industry and are helping to maintain General 
Electrics leadership in this field.

Freshman Regulations
The miserable failure of the half-hearted attempt of the 
sophomores to enforce Freshman Regulations this year should 
be seized' by the Class of 1936 as a splendid opportunity to show 
any class spirit they might have. With the existing, freedom 
the freshmen enjoy, it is apparent that they do not realize that 
there are traditions at Carnegie which must be perpetuated.
Of course, this unconeernity manifested by the Plebes is 
not entirely their fault. Have they been instructed enough, 
about the regulations? Surely they can read them in their 
bible, yet what incentive have they to follow them? No oppor
tunities have been offered this year for pre-game football pep 
meetings, which are so vital in stirring up school spirit. Some 
upperclassmen have shown complete indifference when spoken 
to by freshmen. Here arises but another challenge to the 
freshmen to show their congenialty among themselves and to 
those upperclassmen who are not bored with school life and 
with such silly things as class spirit.
In past years, the Cwens and Druids have directed the en
forcement of regulations. While the Cwens have attempted to 
fulfill their one obligation to Carnegie this year, the Druids 
seemingly are unaware of their very important responsibility. 
The blame for this condition, however, falls upon the shoulders 
of last years Druids, since the members of this years group 
have not yet been initiated into the society. Regardless of this 
fact, the members of this years group have not shown any desire 
to find out the present status of the society as a campus honorary. 
Even some of the members are not interested enough to attend 
meetings. Despite the fact that a Student Council committee 
is investigating the status of the organization, there is no ex
cuse for the obvious lack of interest shown by the members to
ward Freshman Regulations. When such a condition exists, 
there is no necessity for the existence of such an honorary, and 
the Student Council should take steps to annul the Druid char
ter il! the group does not fulfill its duty to the school.
Freshman elections are being held in all schools today and 
the yearling class will choose the men and -women who are to 
lead them throughout the remainder of the year. As yet, the 
freshmen have not done anything as a group to show that they 
arc unified and interested in demonstrating to the lethargic 
sophomores what class spirit really is. The fact that the sopho
mores do not have any interest in their school lil!e should not 
discourage the Plebes. It will be up to the new freShman 
officers to stir up some class activity.
The Tartan Presidential Poll
This issue ol! the Tartan carries an announcement'that .the 
Tartan will conduct a presidential straw-vote next week among 
the students and faculty of Carnegie. So much interest is being 
shown over the coming election'that the Tartan believes it will 
be interesting to learn how the students and faculty aredis
posed toward the various candidates and party platforms. The 
Administration has very willingly co-operated with the Tartan 
in allowing the poll to be held during a class period when the 
greatest number of students at any one time during the week, 
will be in classes in order that as many as possible of the students and faculty will be covered by the poll. It is through 
jthis co-operation that the Tartan hopes to avoid an outstanding 
fault of the usual student pollthe undesirable situation where 
only a few students vote ancl results are published as the senti
ment oi! the entire student body.
In order that the students will clearl}1- understand the plat
forms oi: the various parties; a man well-versed in political af
fairs will speak on this subject at a special assembly which will 
he held next Tuesday. Next weeks Tartan will carry several 
articles about the present campaign and the candidates.
The Tartan will co-operate with the Daily Prineetoniair of 
Princeton University in conducting a nation-wide college poll, 
the results of which will be published in connection with the 
Carnegie returns 011 Tuesday, November 1. Tliirty-four papers 
of leading colleges and universities will conduct polls similar 
to the Tartan poll.
Inasmuch as the Tartan straw-vote, under the present ar
rangements, will be the only one in Pennsylvania included in 
this nation-wide college poll, it will be interesting to see how 
the Carnegie student returns representing this state will com
pare with those from other sections of the country.

Music Guild Has 
Special Student 
Concert Rates
The Music Guild of Pittsburgh for the first time is presenting the String Symphonic Ensemble of Pittsburgh under the direction of Signor Oscar E. Del Bianco in a 
series of six concerts at Carnegie 
Music Hall. The Music Guild offers three classes of membership: Patron, $25.00; Active, $10.00; Student, $2.50. Each subscriber, upon payment of above dues is allotted two reserved seats for the series of concerts. Student membership is available upon sub
mitting evidence of enrollment in an educational institution. The concerts will be given at 8:15 on the following evenings: October20, November 25, .December 29, 
January 27, March 9, and April 20.The String Symphonic Ensemble is at present composed of twenty- eight string musicians to which a 
group of woodwinds, and horns is added as needed. This is the Ensembles third season. The group 
is dedicated to the production of chamber music. classic and modern. Its conductor, Oscar del Bianco, a pupil of Antonin Dvorak, has conducted such famous musical groups in Europe as the Symphony Orchestra of Naples and the Opera of the National Theater in Rome; in America, the Manhattan Symphonic Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Symplionietta.

of Hoover by Coolidge. Speaking of Coolidge, we find him having 
quite a few words to say in his own peculiar, vague, meaningless way about the coming election, the achievements of the Republican candidate, and the importance of 
party unity.
To summarize the entire situation at the present time when the political jamboree- is at its middle October height, I should say that Herbert Hoover is in a much more favorable position than that in which he found himself a few weeks ago. I expect to see him continue to improve his position so that by election time it will be a toss up as to who the next president will be. As Hoovei is strenghening his hold, Roosevelt, 
who looked very strong for a while, is beginning to weaken under the frank, straight forward speeches of Odgen Mills and other Hoover backers who are still young enough to realize the position of the United States at the present time. By next week I 
anticipate a great increase of Hoover votes both straw and bonafide.
FRQM THE FE-MCE
AT THE OLD SWIMMING HOLEAn imposing array of Carnegies bathing beauties and beach adonises took to the water one last time before they called a halt for the present season, and after a most successful splashfest sponsored by the W. A. A., went home to pack 
away the old swim suit and hang up the coat of tan for another season.Every conceivable diversion was in order from Culbertson to balloon busting. Exhibitions by members of the swimming team with Walt Derdeyn and Pal Miller free styling and Ira Kuhn and I-I arry Lebherz fancy diving. Bob Ackley woundup the demonstration with a bit of. what he termed Chinese life saving that had the crowd 
in an uproar.Ann Warden and Marian McNary did some fancy tandem swimming while they waited for Harry Madsens suit to arrive. Sturgis Stentz presided over a table of bridge - most of the evening. Everybody was diving for the balloons and only a few managed to save their hard won laurels from pinching fingers. Betty Preller, Hazel Gough, Leah Voeghtly, Dorothy Schultz, and, in fact, almost the entire W. A. A. was on hand. Doctor and Mrs. Neeley in appropriate at
tire chaperoned.*****
IN CASE YOUVE WONDEREDWhat makes Betty Ailes cheeks  so rosy? Every night at Forbes Hall she has a dish of bran 
instead of dessert.Why Beckey Williams always seems to see you first these days? Its those new lorgnettes.What connection that picture of a young lady wringing a young mans neck had with this column last week? The censors finally caught us.What fraternity is making a bid for the title of High Hatters? The Beta Sigma Rho boys now have two colored maids to assist at their 
dances.What that new society is up at the Phi Kap House? They call it the M. A. S'., which to those in the know 'signifies Mutual Admiration Society. Beta chapter, so they say. Ed Keller has been named the new field secretary and has been assigned the Cleveland territory as his first job. Former Editor Jack Boyle also has his finger in 
the pie.Its really true. The Pi K. A. boys have some -new pledges. Five innocent gold fish and some very lazy snails constitute the pre-season haul. Call out the vigilance committee. They thought

The present year marks thetwenty-seventh in the existence ofCarnegie as an accredited institution of higher learning. As ages 
of schools go, Carnegie is still young. Among the establisheduniversities and institutions it stands as an infant. Older schools have grown strong with thestrength that comes of age.have become firm and stable with experience and secure in the real
ization of their accomplishments. Their principles have become determined and established with age, and the records of their graduates stand as definite proof of the 
quality of their teachings and their worth to the commonwealth. Furthermore, the older schools have developed traditions that have become integral parts of their structure  traditions which, in their effect upon the student, have 
enriched the schoolss more than it is commonly realized.The fact that a student has once studied at a school does not furnish a bond strong enough to instill in the student the genuine love and feeling for Alma Mater that he naturally should have. A stronger tie is needed and can only be supplied by a wealth of tradition and background. It is this bond which Carnegie, in its present state, lacks. The great majority of the students at Carne
gie spend their entire four years neither having gained the feeling 
of loyal nor having experienced the close tie between himself and Alma Mater that is usually evident in a graduate of an older school.This, of course, is inevitable. Carnegie cannot bemoan the fact that it is young. It should, though, come upon the realization that it is leaving its infancy and, perhaps, rejoice in the promise it holds for the future. The. character of 
Carnegie is as yet undertermined, and its background has not mellowed long enough with age to provoke a feeling of reverence in the student. However, it is the present student body and the ones 
in the years immediately following that must affect the transition of infancy into manhood successfully. Carnegie is passing from th haphazardness and thoughtlessnes of infancy into the thoughtfu 
seriousness of manhood. Tin. student must adopt the same attitude in regard to his Alma Mater 
by becoming more serious abou its traditions and more . cognizan of the glorious background ol Carnegie. It is true that students of a technical institution are study ing with a definite purpose ir. mind. This characteristic of the students should reflect tho ctiarac ter of the institution they attend-- just as the so-called type reflects the character of huge state universities. W. L

The Last Mile Opens 
Thursday At Fulton
One of the truly great problem plays of the day, The Last Mile, reaching heights of suspense and emotionalism previously untouch
ed- by a motion picture, opens Thursday at the Fulton Theater.Is capital punishment justified? 
The relentless and ruthlessness of The Last Mile is holding audiences spellbound in its mighty 
dramatic answer to one side of the question as it drives home like a sledge hammer the prisoners side of the machine of man-made justice called capital punishment.With a cast of stage and screen players which includes Preston Foster, Howard Philips, Daniel 
Haynes, Alec B. Francis and many others of equal note, Sam Bischoff has directed this World Wide production of The Last Mile to a terrific, smashing climax.
