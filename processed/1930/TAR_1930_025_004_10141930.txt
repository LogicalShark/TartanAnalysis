Inspite of Handicap 
in Weight
The Golden Tornado of Georgia 
Tech which swept northward last 
week with full intent of devastat
ing a certain ter
ritory around 
Schcnley Park, 
suddenly turned 
tables and limped 
southward after 
one of the most 
crushing battles 
ever- seen in the 
Stadium between 
two of the coun
trys major football teams. T h e 
visitors never had 
 E.STH - a chance. When 
v ever Carnegie had thcT ball, which 
'was most of the time, they sifted 
thi rough the line with some of 
tilec most brilliant playing ever 
scc'hp in these parts for some 
ycai.rs. Sweeping end runs, slabs 
off'] guard, plunges through tackle 
numerous passes, lateral, for
ward and triple, made the Yellow 
Jacjlcets bewildered and lost. Only 
a [few times- did they show any 
rcajl strength, and that was in the 
fin-iil period when the Tartan team 
was composed mostly of second 
ancjl third string men.
Offensive Stars 
- -As in the two previous Satur
days, the Stcffcnite offense clicked 
with precision and nearly every 
play showed a champio'nship team 
marcliing on its way -to victory 
and fame. j 1
"Little Dutch Ey'th played one 
of the most brilliant brands of the 
pigskin game in his football career, 
and time after time brought the 
stands -to their feet applauding his 
prowess. His speed and cutting 
in ability netted him a startling 
score of yardage, and time after 
time placed the Carnegie team in 
scoring distance as avcII as donat
ing touchdowns. All we can . say 
is that if Dutch* keeps this kind 
of work, up we will not be a bit 
surprised to see his name> 011 one 
of those fancy shingles in Bud-1 
dys office along with Howard 
Marpster and Lloyd Yoder.
! Bull Karcis also did : some 
fancy toting, which revealed and 
surpassed his 192S form. Only a 
few-, times did he fail to gain 
through the line and in numbers

MODIFICATION OF HELL 
WEEK IS PLANNED BY 
INTERFRAT COUNCIL
Dates of Rushing Period 
Decided Upon Satur
day At Meeting
At a meeting of the interfratcrnity council, held in the ,(Y club' 
room on October 11, modification 
of "Hell Week was discussed at 
length. Mr. Magnuson, chairman 
of the committee to study the sit
uation, made a report that the ad
ministration desired "Hell Week 
to be so modified that the fresh
men would be able to study, and 
that there be no activities on or 
off the campus that would cause 
unfavorable comment or that would 
endaifgcri life of freshmen. - 
The council was in favor of the 
committee consisting of Messrs. 
Magnuson, Ware . and Smith to 
draw up rules concerning the prob
lem and that  definite action be 
taken at the next meeting of the 
council to change conditions dur
ing "Hell Week.
Mr. Bryant, chairman of the 
committee to report on the proba
tionary period of Tau Delta Phi 
Fraternity, reported that this fra
ternity did not have a faculty ad
visor, and since the council consti
tution requires every fraternity to 
have a faculty advisor before being 
recognized as a voting piembcr, a 
motion was carricd that the mat
ter. of recognizing the Tau Delta 
Phi fraternity as a voting member 
be tabled until a faculty advisor 
be obtained.
The council decided that it was 
in favor of having November 22 
through December 6 as rushing 
dates for this year. A committee, 
composed of the following, was 
appointed to see that rushing rules 
are not violated: D. Knouse,
chairman, W. W. Ware, C. Silsam, 
W. Worland and J. T. Smith.
The council decided that the $50 
rushing bond must be posted in 
the hands of the treasurer of the

DR. VAN ETTEN TO 
SPEAK AT CHAPEL
The first Chapel Exercise of the 
year will be luld today at 12:30 
in  the Little .Theater in the Col
lege of Fine Arts. Dr. Edwin J. 
Vaii Etten, of the Calvary Episco
pal Church, will deliver the ad
dress. Last year Dr. Van Etten 
spoke very cleverly on "Old Shoes, 
and this year lie will speak 011 a 
subject which should be of interest 
to all students, for Dr. Van Etten 
is very much interested in stu
dent welfare. A program of musi
cal selections has been prepared 
by the music department. Miss 
Suzanne Sciger, accompanied by 
Mathew Frey, will present several 
numbers. As customary, the as
sembly will be presided over by 
President Baker.
All plebe women arc required to 
attend chapels, while plcbe men are 
urged to take advantage of the 
spiritual opportunities offered by 
the addresses and. musical pro
grams given. The programs last 
abo.ut one-half hour, and so there 
is ample time to attend the chapels 
even if one only has an hour for 
lunch.
The chapel exercises, which are 
sponsored by the Y. W. and Y. M. 
C. A. cabinets, arc held every 
other Tuesday during the lunch 
hours. Prominent ministers of the 
Pittsburgh district arc invited to 
address the students about topics 
of popular interest, ..
PITTSBURGH COLLEGES 
CURRENT REGISTRATION 
SHOWS SMALL INCREASE
A survey of the four colleges in 
Pittsburgh, Carnegie, Pitt, Penn
sylvania College for Women, and 
Duquesne University, reveals that 
the enrollment figures are approxi
mately the same as last year, with 
the grand total nearing fourteen 
thousand.
Registration at Carnegie for the 
first semester shows a total of 
2,457 students; at the University 
of Pittsburgh a total of 10,931, in
cluding all the colleges, downtown 
divisions, and off campus ccntcrs, 
and at P. C. W. 313 students, ap
proximate^ the same . number en
rolled at the same time last year.
Carnegie Shows Increase 
I11 each case there is only a 
slight, expansion over last y'cars 
enrollment, with the greatest in
crease showing in the freshman 
class in the College of Industries 
and Engineering at Carnegie. The 
freshman total for the first semes
ter, 1929, in these college?, was 
366 students, which has grown this 
semester to 406. This is t'nc larg
est freshman class in the history 
of Carnegie.
According to Alan Bright, regis
trar, "this registration is remark
able, considering the general finan
cial condition . of the, country, and 
I sincerely doubt if any college 
has such an optimistic increase as 
is represented by our freshman 
class.
Academic Quality Improves 
Although tlie total enrollment 
shows, no astounding increase, Mr. 
Bright observes a higher academic 
quality among the new students. 
Those who formerly attended Har
vard, Dartmouth, Vassar, and the 
like, are now coming to Carnegie. 
"This, to me, is a" greater ad
vantage, and shows a higher de
gree of progress than a larger 
number of students with lower 
scholastic standing.
Statistics compiled by Mr. Bright 
and his staff show that half the 
student body at Carnegie is drawn 
from Pittsburgh and Allegheny 
county, while 70 per ccnt come 
from Pennsylvania, and about 28 
per ccnt of the. entire student body 
live in Pittsburgh proper.
Cosmopolitan Student Body 
Represented among the day stu
dent body are 43 states, (lie. Dis
trict of Columbia, Alaska, the.Canal 
Zone, the Philippine Islands,  and 
eight foreign countries. Ohio, rep
resented by 230' students, ranks 
next to Pennsylvania, while New 
York falls into third place with 
128 students on the Carnegie cam
pus. Next, in > order, is West Vir
ginia with 51 students, New Jer
sey with 39, Cpnnccticut with 35, 
and Illinois with 25.
Entering the freshman class in 
engineering are, four students from 
Canada, one from .Alaska, and two 
from the Canal Zone. Of the for
eign students, two come from India, 
one from Palestine, three from 
Mexico, and one each from New 
Zealand, Turkey, the Piiillipiri.es, 
Germany, and Scotland.
Engineering School Largest 
On the Carnegie campuc the 
largest group of students, 675, is 
enrolled in the College of En
gineering; the College of Fine Arts 
ranks second with 606 students, 
while M. M. C.. C. has an en
rollment of 507, and the College 
of Industries has 263 students.
At the University of Pittsburgh 
the under-graduate ' total is 4,204, 
with the largest -group, 1,246, in 
the freshman class. Sophomores 
rank next with 919 students, juniors 
with 837, and seniors with 776. 
Specials, unclassified, and parttime students number 426. Of the 
graduate students, 327 have entered

Martha Burry Will Be 
New Student Director 
Of Womens Glee Club
Martha Burry, 32, has been 
chosen Student Director of the 
Womens Glee Club for the present 
year to succeed Helen Weber, 31, 
who recently resigned the position 
because of' illness . in her home. 
Miss Weber conducted two very 
successful concerts since the open
ing of school. Due to the clubs 
splendid performance at the Slieradcn club, they received requests 
for three future concerts. Two of 
these will be held in Pittsburgh 
and the third one will be an out 
of town performance. Miss Burry, 
the  new Student Director, is a 
member of the honorary musical 
sorority, Sigma Alpha Iota; Beta 
Tau Lambda, social sorority; and 
is a former Cwcn.
Fifty-four new members were 
admitted to the Glee Club during 
the past week. At their first try
out, thirty-five freshmen women 
were present and twenty-five more 
attended the second test which was 
held October 7 in the assembly 
room of Margaret Morrison. After 
being accepted, the girls were class
ified according, to their vocal range 
and the weekly practices began 
immediately.
Carnegie Techs Famous Kiltie Band 
Through the Eyes of Its Drum Major
Whenever the football season 
starts and the team is discussed, 
ihcsc subjects also bring to mind 
one of Carnegies most interesting 
activitiesthe Kiltie Band, which 
makes its appearance aljhost every-, 
where the team goes. The. uni
forms and appearance of the band 
so colorfully represent the tradi
tions of the school that they very 
effectively meet the public's dc-j 
mand for pageantry at the football 
games.
Many of us can call to mind the 
thrill which comes after watching 
the visiting band go through their 
paces, especially when we arc a 
mere handful among strangers 
away from home. The Kilties, 
playing one of those stirring 
marches in regular Kiltie style, 
then swing out on the field with 
their snappy" step and flashing 
knees. It is then that our hearts 
start to tingle', and we get that 
feeling of Now well show them. 
Not only do the display and music 
impress us, but they have given to 
the band a popularity which is 
widespread. Last year word was 
sent to New. York University that 
it would be -impossible for the 
band to come 011 account of in
sufficient funds; New York Uni
versity wired back asking how 
much was needed to bring the 
band, and later supplied some $700 
to make the trip possible. This
By F. T, MUELLER
year % the athletic association is 
very generous in making it possi
ble for the band to have three 
trips. They will include trips to 
South Bend, Cleveland and Phila
delphia.
The boys themselves get a great 
deal of fun out of^their jobs, par
ticularly when they are on trips. 
Just ask an^' of the members how 
we landed in Morgantown with a 
bang. In fact it was a little too 
much of a bang to suit some when 
the special train ran into a switch
ing engine in the yards, causing 
dust and people to be thrown 
around like in tlie molecular the
ory. The bad part was that the 
Kilties had to parade through 
Morgantown with dirty knees. This 
made it . especially embarrassing to 
the bo3rs since it kept their dim
ples froin showing up in their us
ual. perspective.
Hotel accommodations also give 
the Kilties considerable trouble at 
times. For instance, they find it 
necessary .to take spoons, which 
they consider as medicinesome
thing to be' taken after meals. The 
boys always think the floor maids 
very polite because they ask the 
guests if they have left anything. 
The Kilties are always" proud of 
the fact that they can answer in 
the negative.
But they arent quite so well

ROSS REVIEWS FRENCH 1 FOUNDERS DAY TO BE 
ECONOMIC SITUATION NEXT THURSDAY, OCT. 16
Economics Professor Find; 
Employment Conditions 
Quite Favorable
France has reached the high 
tide of prosperity, and the ebb ,of 
world depression is beginning to 
be felt, asserts Professor Samuel 
B. Ross, of the Economic dcpartmcn, who has jus.t returned from 
Francc.
Professor Ross had an oppor
tunity of interviewing business 
men in the principal cities and 
provinces, and says that unem
ployment, except in Paris, -seems 
non-existent. Several business men 
reported themselves unable to ob
tain employes to do their work.
Professor Ross was interested 
mainly in study of the influence of 
French wine producers on French 
politics and foreign relations. He 
found the industry woll organized 
for the protection of the market 
through political pressure and eco
nomic action. The grape growers 
throughout the wine producing 
regions unite in electing deputies 
and senators favorable- to the in
dustry. This results in a- wine 
bloc of about 230 members in the 
Chamber of Deputies. By working 
through this bloc, the industry 
has been able to dictate legisla
tion protecting the market from 
adulterated wines, over-production, 
and competition of imported wines.
Professor Ross finds that in 
several cases the wine producers' 
organization has even been able 
to protect its foreign market by 
dissuading countries from adopt
ing prohibition. This was ac
complished in one case by a 
veiled. threat to raise the French 
import duties on fish and lumber 
coming from the Scandinavian 
country in question.
Luxury Trades Decline
In regard to other  trades, the 
luxury trades, for instance, begin 
to show signs of decline with a 
real possibility of other trades 
following. This is particularly 
the case since the recent German 
elections threw the German pay
ment of reparations into the realm 
of uncertainties and created a state 
of nervous apprehension in Freuch 
business circles.
Some European bankers who are 
in a position to kriow the facts, 
such as Sir Arthur Du Cros, of 
London, and Mr. Perry, of Vienna, 
express the fear that Germany may 
cease to pay reparations and may 
default on the non-postponable as 
well as the postponable payment.s 
under the Young Plan. Such an 
eventuality would seriously endan
ger the value of German issues in 
this "country and would further 
embarrass international trade anti 
credit the world over.

COMBINED DINNER OPENS 
Y MEMBERSHIP CAM
PAIGN TUESDAY, OCT. 21
The campaign for members of 
the Carnegie Tech branch of the 
Y. W. and Y. M. will open next 
Tuesday, Octobcr 21, with a com
bined Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. din
ner in the Commons at six o'clock. 
Dr. Petty of the First Baptist 
Church will be the main speaker 
of the evening.
The enrollment drive this year 
will be carricd on ini a different 
manner than last year. Campaign 
Chairman, Robert Kleine from the 
College of Industries has devised 
a divisional plan whereby each 
school will have its own drive 
head. The separate school heads 
will have department chairmen un
der \ them who, 11 turn, will have 
class workers under them. By such 
a plan, the heads of each school 
and the campaign chairman will 
have a definite check on the prog
ress being made by the rest of 
the solicitors. The cabinets also 
expect, the plan to bring a quicker 
and more direct contact with the 
students. John Alins will act, as 
chairman in the Arts school; Frank 
W. Mueller, in the School of En
gineering; Frank Stengel, .in the 
School of Industries; and Floy 
Sample, in Margaret Morrison.
Preceding the opening of the 
drive, the members of the Cam
paign committee, of which there 
will be about three hundred, will 
attend a banquet in the Commons 
on Monday evening, October 20, 
at six oclock. Dr. Albert E. Day, 
minister of the Christ Methodist 
Episcopal Church and one of five 
speakers of the Forum held at 
Carnegie Hall last Tuesday even
ing, will be the main speaker of 
the evening.
A big feature of the-three dollar 
subscription for the men this year 
is the fact that it entitles the hold
er to the full privilege of the 
Downtown Y. M. C. A. Heretofore, 
a five-dollar membership card was 
required to enjoy the same facilities.
The downtown Y. M. C. A. is 
located at the corner of Wood 
street and Fourth avenue and has 
numerous athletic facilities open 
to' its members.
Chairman Kleine asks that any 
men who are interested in working 011 tlie drive report to Mr. Davis 
in the Y;. M. C. A. office as soon 
as passible.
In ' conjunction with the drive, 
the Y. W. C. A. held a Big and 
Little Sister tea for the freshmen 
women in order to acquaint the 
new women with theY. W. C. A. 
and its activities.
The Y. W. and Y. M. C. A. 
cabinets will each send one dele
gate to f' the Annual Religious Re
treat at Oglcbay Park near Wheel
ing, W. Va., to be held during the 
we.ck end starting Saturday, Octo
ber 18.  The retreat is sponsored 
by the Y. W. and Y. M. C. A. or
ganizations of the University of 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania College 
for Women, and Carnegie Tech 
each year for the purpose of dis
cussing religious work on the three 
cam puses.
Miss, Ruth Brooks, treasurer of 
the Y. W. C. A., will attend the 
Middle Atlantic Field Council as a 
representative of Carnegie Tech. 
The Council will be held this 
week-end at Trinity Manor, Ex
port, Pa.
Interesting Programs 
re Being Planned For 
Industries Assemblies
A news reel and brief talk on 
a subject of general interest to 
Industries students is to be offered 
at the College of Industries As
sembly periods this year, in an' ef
fort to. present in an entertaining 
way information on current topics.
Students in the technical - col
leges commonly carry such heavy 
schedules of courses directly relat
ed to their professional choice that 
they have "no time to keep inform
ed on those matters of general in
terest with which every educated 
man should be familiar. Recogniz
ing this condition it is planned to 
obtain a speaker for each assem
bly who may be able to pfesent a 
15-minute talk of entertaining and 
informational value.
Opportunity will be taken also 
to present the various department 
heads of the College, in order that 
the students may become acquaint
ed with all of these men.
The program for the Octobcr 
2lst meeting, which will be held 
in Room 104, College of Indus
tries, follows:
11:30 to 11:35, Music. 11:35 to 
11:40, Student Council, Mr. Traa 
presiding. Introduction of the 
Assembly by Director Jewett. 
11:45 to 12:00, Some Pf rsonalitic? 
in the Industries, Professor C. G.

CARNEGIE-NOTRE DAME 
DANCE TO BE HELD IN 
UNION SATURDAY NIGHT
The fourth football dance of the 
season will be held in the Union 
on the night of Saturday, October 
18, from 9 p. m. until 12. This 
dance falls on$ the night of he 
Tech-Notre Dame game andj it is 
anticipated that this event will be 
in celebration of another Tech 
victory.
Preparations arc being made to 
take care of a large crowd. A 
local orchestra, Boccliicchio's Ve
netian Sercnadcrs, who have gained 
considerable popularity on previous 
similar occasions, have been ob
tained, so that good music is as
sured.
The usual admission fee of $1.25 
will be charged. Tickets may be 
purchased at the door on the'cvcning of the dance. Everyone is 
invited to these dances, especially 
the freshmen. It is one chance 
for them to become better ac
quainted with the uppcrclassmen. It 
is also hoped that many of the 
upperclassmen who have not here
tofore been present will attend. It 
is one way of showing the foot
ball team that we arc behind them 
if we turn out and give our sup
port to these football dances.

JOHN ALMSCarnegie Tech's football team, 
now an established threat for na
tional honors, will wind up their 
strenuous preparation for t'he Notre 
Dame game tomorrow. Playing 
for the first lime at the new South 
Bend stadium, the boys will at
tempt to repeat their 1928 feat and 
hand the Irish their first home 
defeair It will be recalled that the 
Skibo lads look the measure of 
the Roclcne crew that year 27-7 in 
administering the first defeat the 
famed /South Bend team had ex
perienced oh its home field for a 
period of over two decades. 
The Tartans still have a number 
of the boys Who aided in this re
markable victory, among them be
ing Captain John Dreshar, RosenzWeig-, Schnupp, Highberger, Eytli, 
arid the Flanagans. That year the 
playing of "Ted" Rosenzweig gain
ed him a position on Rockne-Warner-Jones selections for All-Amer
ican honors. Last year, despite a 
7-0 defeat at the hands of the 
Irish, Highberger and Dreshar were 
selected as members of the AllNotre Dame opponents team.
When the Ski bos go into battle 
they will be meeting a team that 
can boast of-two of the greatest 
full backs in football. Moon" 
Mullins who opened the season as 
the regular fullback was injured in 
the Southern Methodist game and 
was not able to play against the 
Navy, but Roclcne expects to have 
him on hand '.Saturday. ' Savoldi 
however has been making a name 
for himself during the absence of 
Mullins. In. the Southern Methodist 
game lie turned in- the longest fun 
to date when he ran back a kickoff some ninety-five yards for a 
touchdown. In the Navy game 
Saturday ;he was once again the 
outstanding performer,; scoring three
There is a story about that just 
before the game Saturday Coach 
Allison gathered his yearlings to
gether and intimated rather subtly 
that unless they won  that game, 
they wcujd be put on the hog and 
hominy diet that the Gawgia Tech 
bccfers are .nursed on.
"Oli, not that, not/ that!" cried 
the Plebes to the man as they 
rushed into the fray with intentions 
of mayhem.
After two hours of bone crush
ing and hard tackling, the tally 
was computed, and it was found 
that the Frosh had been spared the 
agonies of hog and hominy, by' a 
2-0 count. To say that it was a 
hard encounter is to put is a bit 
too mildly, Both teams fought, 
and fought hard, from opening 
whistle to final gunor rather to 
that ungodly foghorn.
Kiski kicked oii to the Carnegie 
thirty marker. On the second play 
a long run advanced the ball twentyrfive yards, but. after that the 
game quieted down into, an ex
change of punts for the remainder 
of the quarter. Tcssers kicking 
for the Plebes was longer and high
er in general than the Kiski punt
ers, but good luclc on the bounds 
and accurate shooting out of 
bounds enabled the prepsters to 
keep things even.
Shortly after the start of the 
second quarter, Dreshar broke 
through and blockcd a Kiski kick; 
the ball bounded oil his chest find 
rolled over Kiskis goal line where 
it was recovered by one of their 
backs for a safety. Tech 2, Kiski 0. 
Tile rest of the quarter was un
eventful, except for a moment when 
Saylcs ciric near losing his pants, 
at. which time the tape squad was 
called out for his relief.

Basketball Candidates Open Season Friday 
Tomorrow Afternoon | With Geneva Contest
The first crSs-couiitry cohlcst of 
the season will bCs held at Geneva 
next Friday afternoon, bringing old 
rivals together once again. Gen
evas course is about two miles 
shorter than the Schciiley Park 
route, and because of this, Coach 
Halfert'y's proteges should find go
ing a little easier than usUal, blit 
on the other baud, the Carnegie 
runners will .compete with a speedy 
bunch of harriers from the Beaver 
Valley school, and Coach Halferty 
looks forward to a close contest. 
The Carnegie cprcsciitati'vs won 
the ruii hist year on the Plaid 
course by a score of 15 to 40.
At time trials last Friday, Cap
tain Price, Ralph Frank, Krebs, 
Silver, Lord-, Slaiikey, Gideon, Ram
sey, Neff, and Worley finished in 
the order named. It is likely that 
these men will represent the 
varsity at Geneva, although several 
changes ma be -made before the 
meet starts.  Stankey, . Ramsey, 
and Nci arc newcomers to the 
varsity, and already they are forc
ing the- Veterans 'to extend them
selves.
With football season just getting 
under w'ay, we hear the startling 
news from 1 Coach Ralph Hogan 
that the basketball teams are going 
to begin practice this week. jft 
fact,, the Coach wants to see 'all 
the students,, i Varsity and Plebes, 
Avlio arc interested in basketball, in 
the gylii tomorrow afternoon 
between 4:30 arid 5:30. The meet
ing will be merely a gfct-to-gether 
for the Coach to size up his 
material. Practice will really be
gin Monday, October 20.
The Plebes will practice Mon
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays* 
while the Varsity will have the 
gym on Tucsdas and Thursdays. 
One reason for the early practice 
is to get the team in perfect con
dition, so that when daily practice 
begins November 15, the tcairi will 
be pliysially fit to start in earnest. 
The coach doesnt plan to liaVe liis 
Varsity men loaf the nights of the 
week that the Plebes arc practicing, 
so he is ' inaugurating a system 
w|iich is new in all annuals of 
coaching. He intends to have the 
Varsity men coach the Plebes. 
Each Plebe will be givfcii individual 
coaching in blocking, pivoting, 
dribbling, shooting, and passing. 
This will not only be .of great 
benefit to the Plebes, but it_ will 
also give the older i>0s experience 
in teaching, which will no doubt 
help their own game.

How can I read what I write, 
when I dont receive the paper. I 
feoen waiting all week for it, 
and up- to this time (Tuesday of 
next week);-1 have not received it. 
Surely they have ine on the list of 
night students, or maybe they 
think I cant read and dont bother 
sending the paper. Ill wait anoth
er week, and then just listen to 
me if the Plaid doesnt make its 
appearance at my mail box.
I notice that the night students 
gav $243 last 3rcar to the Car
negie Endowment Fund. This 
surely shows loyalty on the part 
of we night students (here I throw 
out my chest, for am I. not aii Idle 
Night Student), but anyhow, we 
could not give to a better cause, 
and it' is certainly gratifying to 
 Carnegie Tech officials I ani sure 
when they receive this kind of a 
token from the night studentbodj-. 
Lets keep the good work up every

The Arrogant Attitude
There can he no doubt in the mind, of anyone who was at 
the game last Saturday that Carnegie lias an excellent team 
We have heard comments from outsiders, some impartial ob 
servers and some who would he expected from point of loyalty 
to favor other teams, and all have nothing but the highest praise 
to express. With the/adoption of this attitude by others, it is 
only natural to assume that Carnegie students would be excep 
tionally proud of their team.When making this natural assumption, however, one should 
distinguish between pride and arrogance, between loyalty and 
conceit. Everyone knows how offensive is the spirit of bravado 
often assumed by supporters of very fine teams, 'these ' howwe-are-going-to-beat-you people are certainly more objection
able than those who are entirely lacking in that rather ^indefin
ite and over-discussed quantity known as "school spirit. . I hey 
.ire disagreeable to their co-rooters and superlatively offensive 
to their opponents. They arc annoying as only a smug person 
can be annoying.The editorial columns of this paper have never been re
served for athletic forecasts, nor do we at any time attempt 
lessons in good manners. We do feel, however, that in view of 
the future probabilities and past experience, some few words of 
warning should be forthcoming in regard to this attitude of 
arrogance. .It is a thing that can spread as rapidly as an epidemic, 
but unlike an epidemic of the more common plagues, there 
is no known specific that can be applied for its prevention.
All the support that can be given to the* Carnegie team is 
certainly its due, but remember that a victory is better cele
brated after than before a game. N. C. N.

the most formidable elevens in the

game has the marks of deciding 
illo eastern champions this year 
and to all Indications it will be a 
wonderful battle of two of the 
nations foremost teamd.
The Scotch and I lie Irish met 
'way back in 1922 for the first 
time. That was when the Plaid 
was just starting toward national 
importance. Notre Dame won that 
year and again the next, with the 
famous "Four Horsemen," and re
peated once more in 1924, to make

it thrice in a row. In. 1926 the 
Tartans snapped out of it, and 
startled the football world by ad' 
ministering a 19-0 defeat to til 
Irish. Then again in 1928 they 
made it two straight by winning 
27-7, and having the honor of be
ing the first team to beat Notr 
Dame on their own field in two 
decades. Then last year ,befo: 
capacity crowd Notre Dame was 
forced from gun to gun before it 
was able to extract a 7-0 victory.
This year's game wlH bo in th 
new Noire Dame stadium and will 
have two teams as powerful as any 
predecessor. The Irish have lost 
Elder, Cannon, Twomcy and 
host of others, while Tech has lost 
Schmidt, English and Kennedy. 
Many of the Carnegie men who 
featured in the 27-7 defeat oVcr 
Notre Dame will be in Saturdays 
lineup.

"Local Boy Enters Carnegie 
Tech
The homc-town favorites were 
sent off to collcgc this fall with 
due celebration, according to the 
clippings that rested on the Em
ployment bulletin board last week. 
It's easy to sec who arc the 
'Prides of Main Street" by the 
clippings from the Uniontown 
Herald, the Peoria Star, and the 
Clarksburg Exponent. Both the 
Mail and Herald, of Hagerstown, 
boasted that William T. ITassett 
and Roger D. Middlckauff had left 
home to seek succcss.
Fraser Hcllcger's departure was 
acclaimed in the Passaic News, 
while C. I, Sawyer was given g 
send-off by the Lowell CourierCitizen. A headline in the Ncwburyport News and Herald read 
"Soars Enters Carnegie. We hope 
the paper may say, four years 
from now, "Enters Carnegie, 
Soars."
There was no clipping, appar
ently, from the Shamokin Daily 
Bugle. The folks at home have 
ceascd to hope for William Al
phonse Conway, formerly the toast 
of Shamokin (until he got so much 
crust).
Another all-night party starts Fri 
day evening when the special pulls 
out for South Bend. If the ride is 
anything like the one two years 
ago, merry will certainly be made. 
The Notre Dame Pittsburgh stu
dents always have a welcoming 
party at the station in South 
Bend. If they didnt, some of the 
boys might continue on to sec the 
Illinois-Michigan game at Urbana.
The only thing, missing in the 
line of music at the game Satur
day was "Jerry McGcorge and 
Music, (quoting from a tca-dancc 
sign.) When the Killies, began to 
scpcratc. before that "C, .numer
ous onlookers feared that at last 
the Kills had messed up their sig
nals and were breaking up into 
numerous bands. Then they found 
out that it was xmly some more of 
Will Worland's trick stuff. He 
promises by the Pitt game to have 
the clarinet players walking on 
their hands while the band plays 
Happy Feet."
The tca-dancc last Thursday (or 
was it Cwcnsday?) was the best'of 
year so far. A larger crew'd 
attended than at any similar func
tion last year. With the $74 clear
ed, the Cwcns should be able to 
buy that grey sweater.
The first spring football play
ers wore the Bands kilts last 
Thursday to have their pictures 
taken for one of Max I-Iannurhs 
picccs-dc-rcsistance. Tank" Highbergor made a good Scot, although 
must have forgotten some articlc 
of Scotch clothing, according lc 
the boys watching him do a chor
us girl's kick. "Tank" always was 
an expert with the Scotch, any 
way.

Should human life be sacrificed 
in the perfection of a commodity? 
Is it right /or a worker, in most 
cases unknowingly, to endanger his 
health in making a more saleable 
product from which his employer 
can reap the gain? The PostGazette of October 1 quotes Dr. 
William S. Wadsworth, coroner's 
physician of Philadelphia,- who ad
dressed one of the groups of the 
National Safety Council which met 
in Pittsburgh last week. He stressed 
the need for the availability of data 
concerning the hazards of industry.
"But tell me whore such can- be 
found concerning the poisons of in
dustry when the Journal of the 
American Medical Association pub
lished a false and misleading plea 
written for the manufacturer as to 
the harmlcssncss of nitrobcnzol; 
when poisonous habit forming 
drugs arc advertised in the daily 
press as safe; when employees of 
industrial plants are forced to sup 
press accounts of poisonings of the 
most severe type; when chemists 
can be hired any day to pose as 
experts to cover up poisons?
"Our medical dictionaries arc full 
of nostrums, our medical printed 
matter is overloaded with them, our 
medical school ,prof essors arc 
bought up by manufacturers.
"We arc told that dangerous 
drugs known to form habit and 
cause death are not poisonous be
cause they do not kill promptly, if 
used in small amounts. So indus
tries use an endless list, of substances, the bodily effects of which

That-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s all I
touch our lives every' da^ is a 
common thing. We take an active 
interest in the many measures 
which have as their main endeavor 
helping us to "stay alive." With 
the growth of industrialism new 
dangers have comc into being of 
which the average person knows 
very little. Of course we hear a 
great deal of the extensive health 
programs and facilities of the mod
ern factory and there is no qucstioii that much has been done al
ready to decrease the hazards of 
industry, especially in the field of 
accidents. But there is another 
phase of the problem with which 
people arc less familiar. It is the 
one discussed by Dr. Wadsworth 
concerning the poisons of industry.
Most of these poisons have comc 
into the process of manufacture to 
cheapen the product or improve it. 
Oncc in a while, though too sel
dom, a case comes before the pub
lic eye and action is taken. One 
of the best known instances was 
the use of phosphorous in matche: 
A substitute was found and by 
eliminating its.mdst widespread use, 
the danger of phosphorous poison
ing was greatly lessened. Another 
well-known cSse is that of the ra
dium poisoning suffered by women 
who painte'd radium watch dials. 
There are many other poisons of 
which less is known. The hazard 
of lead, one of the oldest, has been 
greatly decreased, but it is still a 
menace in the manufacture of such 
things as paint, pottery, aiuk stor
age batteries. Benzol is a new 
poisoning found in the rubber tire 
industry, canning, cleaning and dye
ing. It was recently found that 
tetra-ethyl lead greatly improved 
gasoline, but the effect on the 
workers engaged in the manufacture 
of the gasoline was disastrous.
Admittedly it is a great tempta
tion to the manufacturer to clicapen 
Or improve his product. It is nat
ural that lie should wish to produce 
the best in his field in the most 
efffcieiit manner. What he fails to 
sec is that in the process of manu
facture he is destroying part of his 
equipment. He would become 
greatly concerned if he foiwid that 
a certain acid in his product was 
eating away the metal in his ma
chines. He should show a greater 
concern for his human tools. The 
workers should at least be aware 
of the dangers to which they are 
exposed. Safety measures in this
THE PUBLIC NUISANCE
THE SOCIAL SERVICE 
MENACE
There has lately been a disease 
affecting tlfe college maidens which 
I. can do naught but, as the ancient 
editorial writers would phrase it, 
view with alarm. It is most singu
lar in that -it affects only the 
upper strata of socicty. It is a 
disease which is at oncc insidious, 
ubiquitous, and .disastrous. With 
fatal certainty it attacks and lays 
waste the very finest of our. under
graduate femininity. I refer speci
fically to that odious infection of 
the devil which for want of a bet
ter term, I shall callThe Social 
Service Menace,I refer to that dread fever which 
assails young ladies of the best 
classes and forces them to spend 
their summers in sticky hospital out
patient departments instead of basic 
ing in a hammock with a box of 
fudge in their laps, a novel*in their 
amis, and the plans of attack for 
the male campaign that evening in 
their heads.
What particular pleasure they ob
tain from probing into the filth of 
social service investigation, I am 
at a loss to conjecture. There is 
the thrill, of course, in hearing 
naughty words and seeing them in 
print; there.is the adolescent de
light, too, of talking ,lo a woman 
who has really lived and hearing 
the talcs of masculine frailties from' 
herown non-too-ascptic lips. There 
are, let us be charitable, a sincere 
few - wlio really believe they arc 
being helpful to the unfortunate 
mob.
But the great -inajorily o.f the 
maidens perform the sacred rites of 
social service simply, I believe, well 
simply because it is the prevailing 
fashion. Stung- by the virus of whatit-is - proper-for-cvcry-nicc-young-girlto-do they become these bluc-smockcd 
pests of the hospital corridors. They 
scurry through the halls looking for 
all the' world, as if they iverc im
portant, with perfect coiffures, and a
soft swing to their bodies that utterly 
demoralizes the internes long since 
grown accustomed to the stiff starchi
ness of the nurses.
With ardent enthusiasm and 
twenty-dollar sterling fountain pens 
thoy upbraid mothers of eight with 
twenty-dollar a week incomes, for 
not taking out husband desertion 
insurance. With fierce eye they 
fill out countless requisition blanks, 
doubling the work of the.twelvehour-a-clay nurses who must tact
fully tear them up. They, clog the 
laboratories, they pester the doc
tors, they are a hindrance, to hos
pital efficiency.
But the effects on the maidens 
themselves arc the worst 'things to 
contemplate: With the first order
for a blood count, they lose whatever 
dclicqlc female qualities they might 
have had, and become heartless Ama
zons. Their feminity boils aivay in 
the crucible of the laboratory; the 
nice ingenue smile of the -debutant, 
becomes as smugly mechanical as 
that of ,a hotel hostess.
They do not necessarily becomc 
hard, but they lose their softness. 
Where, h where, are the women 
of yesterdaythe sweet young 
things who could actually blush, 
whose thoughts were above the 
belt, who possessed, really pos-/ 
sessed that elusive quality kiiqwir 
as charm. Are there no nice girls 
any more? Have they all bien 
seared by the dread spirit of s'ocal 
service? Is femininity, not in the 
prudish sense, but in the pristine 
meaning of. the word, a lost art?
O tempes, 0 mores! It would[ be 
a distinct pleasure some time to-have 
a dale with a young lady who .would 
not know the difference between a 
IVasserman and a leucocyte count!
phase of industry can only be ef
fected by bringing the facts dear
ly before the public.

.... says U. S. report
YOU may call it toe itch, golf 
itchthe "doc may call it 
ringwormmillions of people 
who catch it, call it "Athletes 
Footbut all of them are the 
same. A ringworm parasite, 
tinea trichophyton by name, 
causes that redness between the 
toes with i-t-c-h-i-n-g. Tiny 
blisters or a thick, moist skin 
condition may be another symp
tom. Again dryness, with little 
.scales, is a signal.
*"At least half of all adtdts 
suffer from it at some time, 
says the U. S. Public Health 
Sendee. In universities as far 
apart, as Pennsylvania and Cali
fornia 509o of the men have it. 
And the co-eds are not immune 
either.
It lurks in the very placcs 
where we all go for cleanliness 
and health  on the edges of
