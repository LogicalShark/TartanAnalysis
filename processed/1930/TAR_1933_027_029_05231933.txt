Contract Renewal
Student Council has renewed 
the contract of Rollin V. Davis as 
executive secretary of the organ
ization. Mr. Davis, who is execu
tive secretary of tlie local branch 
of the Y. M. C. A., organized the 
Student Council at Carnegie four 
years ago, and has held his posi
tion since that time.
Mr. Davis lias been at Carnegie 
since his installation iu 1921 as 
secretary of the newly-organized 
Y. M. C. A. In 1928 he assumed 
his duties with Student Council, 
-which involve supervision and ad

activities. The actual work on 
campus, Mr. Davis asserts, is done 
"by the students under the direc

Clarion Teachers College, and at

tenant in the SOth Division, 320th 
Infantry.
The war, said Mr. Davis, was 
a great experience, but I would not 
want to see any more wars. Howover. I have . enough respect for 
the possessions and systems of 
this country that I think we have 
in this country something worth 
lighting for. Mr. Davis is an hon
orary member of Scabbard and 
Blade, military honorary.

Many Interesting Facts and Figures 
Revealed About Campus and Bldgs.
This year, for the first time, the 
members of the first year short 
course in Printing published and 
distributed a paper on Exhibition 
Night known as the Exhibition 
Gazette. This paper was publish
ed not only to exhibit the work 
done by these students, but also to 
inform the public about Carnegie 
in general. It gave a short account 
of the work being done by a num
ber of the different departments of 
the school and also listed a num
ber of interesting facts and figures 
that perhaps very few people ever 
knew before.
Many people have commented 
on the beauty of the campus in 
the springtime when everything be
gins to get green and flowers be1C)4n to bud, but few ever realized 
ppiat there are forty acres of green
grass that cover the lawns. This 
grass must be carefully cut and 
cared for all the time.
Windows seem to be just anoth
er item that has become a part of 
our life, but when one of them or 
even a part of one, is broken or 
covered up we realize how really 
necessary they are. In all the 
buildings on the campus and in all 
the dormitories there are 1,200 
rooms, and in the classrooms alone 
there is a total number of 3,000 
windows which consist of 75,000 
panes of glass.
Ten thousand electric light bulbs 
illuminate the rooms and halls, 
and 800 large electric motors are 
required to furnish power for them 
and for all the other electric ap
pliances. Two thousand radiators

Dr. Baker Urges 
M.I.l. to Extend 
Uses for Coal
Dr. Thomas S. Baker In an ad
dress before the Mine Inspectors 
Institute of America at their ban
quet In tho William Ponu Hotel, 
last Tuesday, expressed tho belief 
that fuel technologists, having 
loarnod how to economize on fuel, 
should now center tlioir efforts in 
a search for new uses for coal. In 
his address ,Dr. Baker said: Sci
entific resoaroh can not work any 
magic in an industry that lias 
been greatly neglected by sci
ence. Serious competition with 
coal has come from oil and gas, two 
industries that have called upon 
scientists to aid them.
Furthermore tlie great users of 
coal have utilized the best engi
neering skill available in order to 
learn how to economize on fuel, 
with a result that now a pound of 
coal under the boiler of a modern 
power-house produces the results 
for which five pounds were re
quired a generation ago. It is 
high time that science should help 
the coal mon. Its chief objective 
should be to find new uses-for coal, 
and it can do so. Coal as a raw matrial for the chemical industry will 
Increase In importance and will in 
time call for a large tonnage.
There are many other oppor
tunities for fruitful research in the 
various phases of the coal Industry 
and It is my belief that as the sci
ence of fuel technology advances 
those regions where coal Is found 
will grow in importance."
Years of Planning Make Carnegie 
Campus a Pittsburgh Showplace
Even the most casual Inspection 
of tho Carneglo campus Is suffilent to convince ono that the num
erous trees, plocos of shrubbery, 
and acres of lawn did not, llko 
Topsy, "Just grow.
The beautiful campus, probably 
more appreciated by tho visitors 
than by those to whom It 1 a fre
quent sight, is tho result of yoars 
of planning and construction. Dr 
Baker, with a view toward making 
the campus a showplaco of the 
city, has long been active In the 
direction of tho actual work of land
scaping.
The adoption of a definite plan 
for landscaping the campus was im
possible in tho early days of the 
school and It was not until the 
main service tunnel and other .un
derground. structures we|ro con
structed and the gymnasium built: 
that any progress could be made 
on a coinprohonslvo landscaping 
plan.
After tho street paralleling tho 
Commons had been cut through, 
thus Improving tho whole campus 
and particularly traffic conditions, 
a landscape architect was rotainod, 
plans developed and construction 
work was begun.
The tree and shrub planting op
erations since 1918 include the 
planting of 15,000 trees and a num
ber of deciduous shrubs. Nearly 
5,000 of the trees are deciduous and 
Include maple, oak, elm, poplar, 
larch, linden, and willow. Over 
70 varieties make up the shrub to(Continusd on Page Two)

2THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, MAY 23, 1933
THE
PLAID SPORTS 
SCREEN 

TH EWhe tryau
IT HAS BEEN A VERY TRYING WEEK for Coach Halfcrty and hio 
trackmen, for In two mccto they have met .opposition that wan much 
too clasGy for them. Pitts strong team trimmed them on Tuesday by 
a 95-40 count, and Saturday at Philadelphia Temple ran wild and piled 
lip a 100-35 margin over the Schenley Park squad. Even Captain Coul
ter found the going rough, for tho best he could do was a first and two
seconds in each. On both occasions, however, he coppcd the 220 
against a very strong field. Johnny Sayles was the only other man 
to win a first against Temple, the hammer throw being his specialty.
* * * * *
ATTENDANCE AT AFTERiNOON CLASSES ban boon somewhat poor 
the last week. The probable answer is that the Pirates are back In 
town, and how can any lab expect to compete with tho Waner brother? 
MohL Carnegie sports fan are yelling loud and luBtlly l'or the Hues 
to cop the Hag till time ho that a few world series game might be 
taken in nexL fall. If the big league mogul8 keep up the present Hcale 
of price for the spectacle (10.50 for three gamesnot sold separate
ly), however, 1 cant see where anyone will get the opportunity of see
ing a game unless it be by television.
#  * * *
IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY EARS THAT MR. SPISAK, Carnegie Tech's star running halfback, was led astray last Wednesday 
evening. For particulars I suggest you see Mr. Forsman, who is re
ported to be In the know.

WHEN THE TRACK TEAM GOT UNDER WAY FOR PH ILLY FRI
DAY it looked uh if. the team would havo to sit on the roof after all 
the managers and well-wishers had boarded the bus. It seems as if 
everyone with any friends, relatives, or prospects in the Quaker City 
was going with them. In fact several of my more ardent supporters 
were quite Insistent that I also make the trip, but since I could not 
exactly figure why they were so anxious to get me out of town over 
the week-end, I .thought it might be best to stick around. The bus 
finally got under way around 1:15 with a number of cheers from the 
field house loafers On turning the corner, Tom Coulter, who had been 
relegated to a rear seat, was heard to blare forth in Ills Homewhat 
carrying voice, "This is a ftXX** of a way to treat one of the kings 
Olympic men!
Incidentally the sports staff was Avell represented at the Temple 
meet, for both Cliff Carr and Scotty Charles made the trip on some 
excuse or other.
*
THE MUSHBALL SCHEDULE HAS JUST ABOUT RUN ITS COURSE 
and this week will undoubtedly sec the first of the playoff games under
way. At present the lineup looks to be the same as published last
week. The togas will probably be captured by the Rho Dammit 
Rhos, the T. X.'s, the Kappa Sigs, and the Betas. The Rho Dams met 
unexpected'opposition in the Beta Sigma Rhos and found it necessary 
to go into two extra frames before winning out, 7-6. The Rho Dams 
had a comfortable lead going into the seventh, 6-3, but the notorious Vic 
Mathis tried to ease up, and they connected with his floater in no 
uncertain terms. He tightened up later, but the damage had been 
done. All those in the know, though, still have their dough on the 
dormitory boys to cop the bacon.

IT WAS CALLED TO THIS DEPARTMENTS ATTENTION a week 
or 3T ago that the Tartan had published the account of tho Pltt-Carnegle wrestling meet in its accustomed stylei. e. wrong. This In
formation Wan handed to the reporter covering that sport by tho 
manager himself, ho I cannot see where he can be blamed. While 
on the subject, however, if might be well to mention that tho actual 
Hcoro was 17-13 in favor of Carnegie Tech, and not. <1-3. The Plaid 
grapplers captured Jive out of the eight matches, and in all divisions 
made an exceptionally line Hhowlng. Coach Rintelens throe years 
of hard work In attempting to got. wrestling on an accepted basis in 
tho Carnegie sports program seems at lant to have borne fruit. It 1 
hopod that next year wrestling will become a regular part of the 
school's intercollegiate competition. Mr. Rlntolen has announced that 
tho following wrestlers have boon awarded Insignia by the Carnegie 
Wrestling Association; Mlehner, Munn, Hill llodenborg, Kulo/,, Mc
Curdy, Spencer, Forsihan, and Worry.

CARNEGIE TECH'S NETSTERS MET DISASTER AT THE HANDS 
OF PITT last: Wednesday afternoon, the Panthers capturing all nine 
matches. Captain Rufus Hartlg lost a heartbreaker after three gruell
ing sets, and bin mates .had no better success. Coach Hoovers netmen 
have boon greatly handicapped this season by lack of practice, the 
three weeks of almost continuous rain practically ruining the season. 
It has boon a good many years since the varsity has been limited to 
so few matches through the Intervention of old J. Pluviua.
*i # # * *
IT IS RIDPOltTlflD THAT MAX HANNUM has boon attempting to 
hold spring bsiikotball practice but that he has bail little success In 
getting anyone Interested In It, Without a doubt If Is very dllllcult 
to got anyone excited over haslcefball right now, but Max Insists ho 
in going to have a great foam Home day If he ban to Kill everyone In
cluding the players. Ho refused to answer when questioned us to 
whether the "everyone included referees. Has anyone heard of a 
basketball coach who has boon satisfied with the oillclatlng This 
department will present an extra copy (autographed) of this publi
cation to anyone who can present this species of coach.

WHEN THE BETAS ENGAGE THE PHI GAMS OF PITT this after
noon In a pushmoblljo race over the well-known Schenley Park course, 
who knows but what another tradition will be Initiated. The Phi 
Gams have promised to be right on the line at 4:30 providing they 
can raise enough dough to buy two now wheels to replace those 
wrecked In the Pitt Interfraternity race. This race will be somewhat 
different In that there will be four instead of the usual five pushers 
and the track men will be eligible to compete. The Carnegie frater
nity may have a slight advantage due to the fact that they are more 
familiar with the course and probably have a faster rolling buggy.
# id * * *
MR. OVEREND HAS INSTRUCTED MR. HANNUM not to attend any 
of Carnegie's golf matches in the future, for it stands on record that 
every time Max has stayed away the Plaid has emerged victorious, 
while every time he has been on hand to kibitz they have taken one 
on the lug.

WHEN THE NEWS CAME OUT THAT THE SWIMMERS had again 
come out first in scholarship, Mr. C. R. (Mercury) Boyer, holder of 
several world's records in distances that no one has every heard of 
before, Is credited with the following quip: Well, we may not be
able to beat Pitt at swimming, but we can certainly outsmart them. 
Wise guy, eh! On close scrutiny of the records it was found that Mr. 
Boyer had fallen way below the average of his t^am mates with a 
miserable 4.3.

Girl Athletes 
Are Honored at 
Qualifications
By GLORIA KLOOS
The high scorers of the Wo
mens Rifle Team were rewarded 
for their seasons work at the re
cent Qualifications Day. As is the 
custom, the Men's Rifle- Team 
chose that day to award to these 
prize marksmen the bronze medals 
that may be won only once by any 
member of the team. The recipients 
of the awards included Mary Jane 
Gray, Ruth Schmelz, Elizabeth 
Lowrey, Mary Wettach and Mar
garet Schultz. Mary Jane is a 
Senior in (Margaret Morrison Col
lege, Manager of the Womens 
Swimming' Team and a recent win

Dragons, senior mens honorary.
He resides at Engelbrecht Hall | 
and has innumerable friends on 
the campus.
Mr. Ford was appointed to this 
position to ill I a vacancy left by 
Samuel C. Wicks, Jr., resigned.
Mr. Wicks, the newly-elected treas
urer of Student Council for the 
year 11)83-34, found it impossible
A week ago today the Carnegie 
track team took It on the chin 
from Pitt to the tune of 95 to 40. 
The only bright spots in the meet 
were Coulter, Allen, and Burke, 
who came through with first places 
for the Tartans. Coulter, in his 
usual flashy manner, breezed 
through to an exciting win in the 
220. Allens victory in the high 
hurdles came as somewhat of a 
surprise to most Tartan fans. It 
iserves however as a fairly good in
dication of what may be expected 
from him in the future. Burke, 
Carnegie's star half-miler, came 
through with his usual first place. 
The defeat, however, was not as 
bad as the score indicates. Car
negie showed great strength in all 
running events, winning three first 
places, but ga.ve a poor showing in 
the field events. This shows a lack 
of halance on the part of the Tar
tan squad, which may be remedied 
in the not so distant future.
Owls Are Too Tough 
Sill groggy from the Pitt en
counter, the Tartans invaded Tem
ple the following Saturday and 
again met defeat; the score, 100 
to 35, in favor of the Owls. In this 
encounter Coulter and Sayles were 
tiie only Carnegie men to capture 
first places. Coulter duplicated his 
victory of the preceeding week in 
tlie 220, and Sayles threw the 
hammer far enough to cop a first 
place 'in his event. Burke, Tartan 
half-miler, was defeated for the 
first time this season. Bob Schell. 
Carnegie star miler, was defeated 
at the Quaker City, in the good 
time of 4:34. This is Bob's first 
season as a miler for Carnegie, and 
thus far he has performed very 
creditably. We may expect much 
from Bob next' year when lie be
comes accustomed to the longer 
distance. Coulters comparative
first places in receut

Lowrey is at present manager of in his specialtiesthe hurdles and 
the Archery team and has boon ap-jtlie 440, Tom has been shifted to

with Peggy Schultz formed the] 
freshman representation on theriile team this year. Both girls 
were high scorers in many of the 
Intercollegiate matches. Peggy 
Schultz was awarded the Begin
ner's cup for the highest scoro of 
all boginnors tills season. This 
cup which was won by Ruth 
Schmelz last year was awarded, to

Arts.
-Mr. I-Iornbostel, who expects to 
arrive in Pittsburgh the last part 
of this week, is now occupied in 
making drawings for two impor
tant international 'competitions 
for city-planning in Paris. While 
at Carnegie, as at the ' Ecole in

Golfers Are 
Beaten; Pitt 
Wins by 5 Vfc-3 V2
Burgoyne and McKenzie 
Win Matches; Reese, 
Kay, Fergus Lose
Golfing fans will be treated to a 
rare sight this Saturday when the 
Carnegie Tech varsity golf team 
will take on a pickup team com
posed of members of the office 
force, trustees, and faculty of our 
fair institution. Manager Bevevino reports that the stakesor 
should lie say steaksfor the 
event will be very large. A num
ber of famous stars of other days 
have been rounded up. Among 
these are Max Hannuin, Buddy 
Overend, Howard I-Iarpster, and 
A1 Irwin. Of course the varsity 
is not conceded an outside chance 
to win, but they claim they will 
be right in there fighting.
The varsity will probably be rep
resented by Haverstick, Fergus, 
Kay, Reese, Burgoyne, and Mc
Kenzie.
This match is not the only one 
tap for the golfers, for they play 
two regularly scheduled matches 
besides. On Tuesday they take 
on the Dukes in a return match, 
and Thursday they will attempt to 
turn the tables 011 Pitt. The Tar
tans have already gained one vic
tory over Duquesne, and they will 
be out to make it two straight.
Pitt upset the dope last Monday 
by beating the Plaid turfmen by a 
5Y2 to 3% count. Kay and Fergus 
lost their singles matches and also 
dropped the best ball foursome. 
Haverstick halved his singles 
match while Reese was dropping 
his, and the two of them were 
beaten in the foursomes. Bur
goyne and McKenzie both won 
their singles matches, and the two 
of them also copped a doubles 
event.
To date the golfers . have been 
able to get no better than an even 
break in their matches. They de
feated the Dukes in their first 
meet, and they upset the strong 
West Virginia team at Morgan
town, 5-4, but they have since 
dropped decisions to both West 
Virginia and Pitt.

4:30 over the Schenley Park 
course. The Carnegie fraternity is
sued a challenge last Wednesday, 
and the Pitt fraternity has agreed 
to race if they can raise the money 
to make some necessary repairs on 
their machine. The Pitt course is 
very hard on buggies, and it is un
derstood that the Phi Gam car 
broke two wheels in copping the 
Pitt classic.
To conform with the Pitt rules, 
four men, instead of the customary 
five, Avili push for each team. One 
man will push up the hill in front 
of the gym and will then proceed to 
ride with the car to the bottom of 
the hill, where he will be relieved 
by Pusher No. 2. From there on 
the stations will be the same as is 
customary in the Carnegie race.
Under the Pitt rules, track men 
are eligible to run, so there is a 
strong possibility that Tom Coulter, 
captain of the Plaid tracK team, 
will be pushing for the Betas. 
Other pushers will be chosen from 
Biggin, Croissant, HoAver, Edelblut, Goodridge, and Anderson.

llepight
Well, another spring carnival 
has come and gone and the event 
is history now. To say that the 
activities of this festive occasion 
were not patronized by the student 
body would be presenting some
thing Which would be untrue. 
Each year different conditions 
have to be met with by those who 
sponsor the activities of the spring 
carnival and this year was no ex
ception, in fact, many conditions 
were present which in other years 
were absent. It is therefore a 
source of gratification to yours \ 
truly to report that from an Idle 
Students viewpoint this years 
spring carnival was the equal, 
everything taken into consideration, of any ever held and it is an 
indication that the students will 
patronize their activities if they 
are given a chance to participate.
Committee Requests 
All Ticket Returns
So that the Insignia Award 
Committee may complete its 
work of tabulation of points for 
awarding the Night Student 
Council Insignia, all students 
who are still holding tickets for 
any dance are requested to 
make immediate returns to 
John F. Simpson. Treasurer, 
Night Student Council, Box 137, 
Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, Schenley Park, Pitts
burgh, Pa.
Greater Activity 
Noted In People 
As Times Better
I suppose the calls issued by the 
fraternities on call day caused a 
great deal of comment, throwing 
out of chests, raising of hopes, ex
pectations, and whatnot for the re
maining days to come. Bet some 
of those who received calls are 
anxiously waiting for the day of 
doom when they will answer the 
call to come prepared, etc., etc., 
etc., for that all too prevalent in
formal ------------------. Glad I am not
among those who are called, and 
anyway who would want an idle 
person around?
The last dance of the Night Stu
dent Council has come and gone 
and there remains nothing to look 
forward to now in the school activ
ities until next fall when the bell 
will ring again indicating that the 
doors are open for another school 
year. Speaking of the dance, how
ever. I certainly enjoyed myself, 
and I am sure all those who were 
present did likewise. All of us had 
plenty of room to strut our stuff in 
the big gymnasium and from the 
way some of the dancers were 
spinning around I wonder how they 
managed to tread the fantastic 
when the place was crowded. No 
doubt the reason for some of the 
emptiness of the place can be 
ascribed to the weather.
And as for the weather, did you 
ever see it rain so hard as it did 
on the night of the Inter-Night 
Dance? Seems as if all the water 
was held for that occasion and at 
the appointed time, presto the 
faucet was turned on, and the 
deluge started. There was no 
ducking the drops, you just had to 
take your medicine.
The panics gone. The boom is 
on. (We hope!) At any rate, it 
would seem that the depression' has 
finally decided to leave for Mars 
or Jupiter, or some place, and 
plague the .inhabitants there while 
we gasp and grunt and try to re
cover from the shock of his long 
extended visit to us. There is no 
doubt that hopeful signs of an in
crease of buying has put in its ap
pearance, and with this increase 
has copie the natural speeding up 
of the wheels of industry to supply 
the demand.
The change has come upon us 
while we slept, as it were. Many 
of us had fallen into the reprehen
sible attitude of regarding the sit
uation as a necessary evil. We 
were content to lay back and groan 
about hard times. We had watch
ed carefully for signs of an up
swing, and every time that the 
curve of business rose, we re
joiced, only to be plunged into 
gloom in a short time as the slight 
rise lost its impetus, and the curve 
fell back to what was too often a 
new low level.
But, this present improvement 
in conditions seems to be more 
permanent than the others. A bet
ter spirit is seen among the peo
ple, and hope is being born again 
in the hearts of even the rankest 
pessimists. Instead of a sudden 
spurt, as was characteristic of 
all other gains, this change has 
taken place in a quiet, gradual 
manner, so quietly, in fact, that its 
magnitude is not appreciated until 
a survey of the entire economic 
field is made, and it is appreciated 
that the rise .is general.
Let us hope that our recent 
gains will not be lost. Let us hope 
that this Summer and Pall will see 
the complete'and healthful recov
ery of the pulse of our country and 
its industries. And, above all, let 
us hope that we have learned to 
profit by our past experiences of 
the last three or four years, and 
that a finer and newer feeling of 
co-operation will displace the greed 
and selfishness that was largely 
responsible for our downfall.
Tts an ill windbut if the rain 
-v-ftsr.t good for the dance, it was 
for something else much to the 
.............ask Fritz, hell tell you. Any
way, the yellow flowers are com
ing along nicely these days and it 
wont be long until we have a yel
low lawn instead of the green one 
we are accustomed to. The beau
tiful flowers are springing up 
everywhere. Soon the army of 
pickers will be doing their stuff 
and bringing in the  harvest. 
M,aybe Fritz will have a different 
story to tell about the R. O. T. C. 
tramping on the lawn, for I am 
sure that some of the flowers were 
nipped in the bud at least while 
the tramp, tramp, tramp, of the 
soldiers was under way. How about 
it, Fritz?
I see that there is another class 
of night graduates scheduled to go 
out in the world and show what 
we do out at Schenley. I read 
where these students were the 
guests of Dr. Baker at a dinner the 
other evening, and I certainly 
envy this group. I would like to 
be able to attend one of these din
ners, but I guess that time will be 
a long time in coming for me. 
When you hoar of students coming 
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and even longer, one year atter an
other. those of us who are young 
in the game and have attended 
classes a couple of years certainly 
have along road to look forward to. 
Suppose it is all right though, as 
nothing is worthwhile without an 
effort, and going to night school, 
year after year surely is an effort.

PRESIDENT ELECT
ALEXANDER JOHN LOIS
Alexander John Lois, registered in 1 
the Night College of Engineering i 
in the Department of Electrical En- j 
gineering where he is a candidate j 
for the Night School Diploma in 
1934, was elected president of the | 
Night Student Council for the 1933- i 
34 school year.
Upon graduating from Schenley j 
High School in the spring of 1922, 
Mr. Lois registered in the Night 
College of Industries the following 
fall for a Mechanical Drafting 
course which he completed in 1926 
when he received the college cer
tificate. In the fall of that year 
he registered in the Night College 
of Engineering for the Electrical 
Engineering Course and has con
tinued to the present time. He is 
a member of Phi Nu social frater
nity.
Entering the extracurricular ac
tivities of the Night Student Coun
cil in 1930-31, Mr. Lois was elected 
treasurer of the Night College of 
Engineering for the 1931-32 school 
year, and the president of this col
lege in 1932-33. Upon his election 
to each of these two offices he be
came a member of the Night Stu
dent Council. He is also the night 
business manager of the 1933 
Thistle.
Mr. Lois has received two schol
arships awarded by the Institute, 
and one awarded by the Night Stu
dent Council.
Mr. Lois will assume the office 
of president of the Night Student 
Council in the fall when the 1933- 
34 school year begins. The Plaid 
takes this occasion to congratulate 
Mr. Lois upon his election and 
wishes him success during .his 
term of office._____________
German Unrest 
Felt in Classroom, 
Says Dr. Baker
The current unrest in Germany 
has not been without its repercus
sions in the university class room, 
Dr. Baker writes in the current is
sue of the Carnegie Magazine. Dr. 
Baker lectured in German univer
sities during the winter under the 
auspices of the Carl Schurz Memo
rial Foundation.
The University has grown in 
importance, lie says, but it is no 
longer a center of calm, cloistered 
scholarship. It Is a focus of polit
ical and social unrest.
Under the Hitler regime the 
German students In their own opin
ion at least, have a more Impor
tant place in the sun, the Carnegie 
President said. Hitlers appeal to 
them has flattered their vanity and 
increased their importance in 
their own eyes.
They enjoy the militant meth
od of extending German Kultur 
and the quasi-military system, the 
uniforms, the discipline, and the 
fervid rhetoric of their Nazi lead
ers. The high-handed methods 
which Hitler -* encourages-or at 
least condones are sometimes 
tragic in their results, and his in
fluence has dealt a serious blow' to 
academic freedom.
Apart from their work their 
chief interest is in politics. I was 
surprised to learn from a former 
minister that in his opinion from 
75 to 80 per cent of the present uni
versity students are anti-capital
istic.
They feel that the present 
capitalistic system is a failure and 
must be changedalthough only a 
small number are Communists.
Hitler has stirred their imagin
ation and has fired their enthusi
asm. Many of them look to him 
not only to save their country but 
they base their hopes of earning a 
livelihood on the changes that he 
will make, both in government and
Social Season 
Ends With InterCollege Dance
With the final strains of the 
music of the Inter-Night College 
Dance came the end of another 
typically successful social season 
of the Night Student Council. Al
though the attendance at all the 
functions held this year was 
smaller than previous years, there 
'was no decrease in the enthusiasm 
on the part of those present. 
Everyone did his best and gave 
old man Depression a good knock
out blow under the chin.
The Inter-Night College Dance 
savored somewhat of the Spring 
Carnival that was in progress dur
ing the week-end. The huge gym
nasium still contained many ban
ners and decorations that had been 
used for the two previous func
tions. so when the night students 
moved in to do their own decorat
ing, they supplemented and aug
mented what had already been 
done, making, a symphonic assem
blage of the whole, and the unique 
pennants designed by one of the 
night students certainly deserved 
notice.
A small but very enthusiastic 
group of happy couples gaily 
danced to the music of El Gitzen 
and his orchestra. Between num
bers the usual congregating about 
the refreshment booth attested to 
the popularity of this thoughtful 
service rendered by the committee.
The inevitable end finally came 
and the tired couples departed 
wishing each other a pleasant sum
mer and I'll be seenya next year.
Guests and chaperons for the 
evening were Mr. and Mrs. Win. 
Pfouts, Mr. and M.rs. William Ii. 
Dosey, and Mr. and Mrs. Raymond 
Simboli.
Request Students To 
Empty Lockers Now
Since the regular session of 
night school has ended, it is time 
to give thought to the lockers 
which were used during the school 
year. Since these lockers will be 
used again next year, and new 
assignments made, it is necessary 
that they be emptied of their con
tents. A request is therefore made 
that the night students who were 
assigned lockers vacate these lock
ers now so that when the time 
comes for the usual checking it 
will not be necessary for the school 
authorities to empty them. The 
contents of these lockers will be 
lost to the former owners if they 
are not vacated before the dead 
line which comes in the early sum
mer.
Return of Employment 
Bureau Forms Asked
During the past few weeks the 
Employment Bureau sent out ap
plication blanks to those students 
who are finishing their courses 
this year. The bureau requests 
that these blanks be returned 
promptly, it would therefore bo 
appreciated if the students could 
mail these within the next few 
days so that the records could bo 
completed.
Summer School 
Finds Corridors 
Empty At Niglit
Now that the old grind is ended, 
and the post mortems on our 
grades have been duly held, the 
peace of the gods descends on the 
campus every evening after the 
last of the day students have left. 
Of course, there are a few of the 
old guard that found enough money 
in the old copper kettle under the 
rafters to manage to get into a sup
plementary term course, but they 
are so broken down by this time 
that they are incapable of making 
any^noise.  As a consequence, the 
aforesaid peace and quiet reigns 
over the campus.
It seems odd to come out to 
school during the present season, 
and find that there is not the usual 
hustle and bustle about the corri
dors, even though the bells relig
iously sound class time, and the 
watchman is as busy as ever keep
ing the halls safe for democracy. 
The lack of students lends a rather 
somber, depressed air to the whole 
district. The few night men en
gaged in supplementary term work 
enhance rather than diminish the 
effect of loneliness.
To those who often have thought 
about such things, the entire cam
pus gives the same effect that must 
be produced on a lone traveler 
that enters an old city and finds it 
deserted, a fact which -was not ap
parent from afar. The absence of 
the fellows that we have associated 
with in many classes, the lack of 
someone to talk to besides the in
dividual whom you came purpose
ly to see. and the general lack of 
industry, are good reasons for 
avoiding the campus during the 
summer.
If anyone is sorry that school is 
over for the time, let him come out 
some evening at dusk, and roam 
around. It will teach him the im
portance of the friendships and the 
good fellowship that exist during 
the school term, and he will be 
surprised to find that many of 
those individuals who were merely 
classmates during the rush of the 
school year are missed, and their 
absence is deeply felt, now that it 
is all over, and the tumult and 
the shouting have died.
Praises Workers 
For Successful 
N. S. C. Affairs
The men and women who so 
well supported the activities of the 
Night Student Council during the 
past school year are worthy of the 
highest praise and the commenda
tions of the entire night student 
body. They certainly did do won
derful work, and, in spite of re
duced budgets, presented enter
tainments that were even bigger 
and better than in the halcyon days 
of 1929.
Their sacrifices of time and ef
fort to provide the many activities 
of the night campus with color and 
dash were very successful. The 
turnout at every affair was very 
good, in spite of existing condi
tions. They at least had the en
couragement of seeing that their 
work did not go unnoticed, as was 
apparent from the atendance.
However, many of the guests at 
these night school affairs seem to 
forget that, behind the scenes, 
there must be someone to do all 
the work, and to plan for their enjoyipent. These affairs are not 
hastily planned, and the decora
tions thrown on the rafters with
out any regard for beauty. Every 
detail is carefully planned, and as 
carefully executed. (
The amount of work necessary 
to these dances, smokers, and so 
on, is enormous, and the student 
body.owes a note of thanks to the 
members of the Activities Commit
tee and their assistants, who toiled 
so hard to provide them with such 
flue entertainment.

A Job Well Dona
Farewell to the retiring stall. They are justified in leav
ing their positions with the delightiful satisfaction that follows 
when a job is well done; for through their efforts the Tartan 
has been raised from a paper of mediocre quality to a college 
weekly that stands a one of the finest of its type in the 
United States.Introducing and carrying out this year an entirely differ
ent style of typography and high standards governing the news 
columns, the'results of the retiring staffs work won for the 
Tartan .the rating of All American-Superior and Pace
maker among college weeklies. They may be said to have 
made some of the greatest contributions to the Tartan since the 
paper was established.If the retiring staff applies the same principles to their 
work in. the business world that tliey have carried out in the 
Tartan, that of making changes, however large, if a change is 
justified and the results are good, they are bound to go far.
The new staff in bidding the retiring staff farewell 
promises a sincere effort to publish a paper worthy of the 
students it represents.
Welcome to Phi Kappa Plii
The installation of a chapter of Phi Kappa Phi at Carnegie 
on June 3 will mark the arrival of an honorary that recognizes 
and binds together students of high scholastic standing from 
many colleges and universities.
Among tlie outstanding features that Phi Kappa Phi will 
bring are the absence of restraining ties which dictate that 
members should he selected only from certain courses, and the 
fact that the objects of the honorary will be carried out by fac
ulty officers. Because of these features, Phi Kappa Phi is in 
a class of its own in reference to the honoraries now established 
at Carnegie.The entrance of Phi Kappa Phi will not add to the num
ber of honoraries at Carnegie but will be replacing one in the 
(College of Industries that is fading in importance because of 
the transfer of several courses to the College of Industries.
The members of the faculty who petitioned for the installa
tion of a chapter of Phi Kappa Phi made a judieious move in 
choosing an honorary that is comparable with Phi Beta Kappa 
and other prominent scholastic honoraries in academic schools.
Theta Tau Aivard
Of recent years columnists have taken great delight in 
ridiculing the practice of many college graduating classes ol 
choosing the man or woman who is most likely to succeed. 
Their criticism is perhaps justified when such Selections are 
made by students themselves on the basis of social standing, 
activities and personality.
However, when a selection is made by members of the fac
ulty purely on the basis of scholastic achievement and engi
neering promise then the criticsm is not just.
Such is the case with the Theta Tau plaque awarded this 
year to Arch Rhodes Matteson, a senior in the Department of 
(iiyil 18nginoering, by I lit* faculty of the College of Engineering 
on the basis of distinguished scholarship, engineering ability, 
breadth of interest, unselfish activity, leadership, integrity, de
pendability, and regularity. The award was made for the first 
time last year and so carefully have the recipients been chosen 
that the Theta Tau award now represents the highest 
honor that can come to a member of the graduating class in the 
College of I'lnginceriug.
Certainly a fine college record is no absolute indication of 
future success. There are exceptions, of course, and brilliant 
students have had a mediocre afterr-collcgc record and just as 
often, perhaps, the* average student has risen to the top in his 
profession. On the whole, however, it is not unreasonable to 
expect that those same qualities which lead to success in col
lege work will also make for success in later life._____________
Pioneering American Life Portrayed
Drama PlayIn Distant Drums,
Dan Totheroh, one of our young 
American playwrights, in Distant 
Drums gives tlieater-goers an ex
cellent social portrayal of early 
American life. The play, which is 
being presented in the Little 
Theater starting tonight, has as a 
background the intimate life and 
associations of Mr. Totheroh him
self, who, when a child heard fire
side stories of pioneer life.
It was from his relatives who 
had been pioneers that the author 
gained his 'first impressions of the 
conflict and struggle for existence 
between early settlers and Indians 
in the Middlo and Far West, and 
through them was encouraged to 
explore further into the fascinat
ing life of that period. He read 
the (totalled, illuminating diaries 
that were willed to him with groat 
caro and talked to various people 
who .still recalled the covered 
wagon days vividly. One of those 
poraonH was an old man la his 
eighties who told Mr. Totheroh 
that it was really true that the In* 
dlivjis are fascinated by the Amer
ican woman, the so-called "white 
B(inaw, and that the young white 
women aro also drawa to them. 
Tho Indians would try to buy 
white wives, but as this was im
possible, they would lure them 
away by the monotonous beating 
of their drums. Mr. Totheroh has 
handled his theme in a beautiful 
fashion, retaining the subtlety and 
witchery of the situation.
The part portrayed so well last 
spring by Pauline Lord in New 
York in Guthrie McClintocks pro
duction will be taken in the Car
negie performance by Jean Dahl 
and - Fern Ball alternately. Mr. 
Wallace, who is directing the phiy, 
has worked it up to a thrilling 
crescendo and the appearance of
actual covered wagons on the 
stage makes a realistic and inspir
ing setting.
The play, which will continue 
through Memorial Day, will be at
tended during the performance of 
the week by several private par
ties. On Thursday night there will 
be a number of members of the 
Pittsburgh branch of the American 
Society of Chemical Engineers and 
on Memorial Day there will be a 
group from the Pittsburgh Divi
sion of Veterans of Foreign Wars.
R.O.T.C. Holds
Review Exercises

of the U. O. T. T. at Carnegie by 
President Thomas S. Baker took

Dempsey, Commander of Co. E, 
winner of tlio competitive drill was 
also presented a. saber for his fine 
work and leadership. * Captain 
George L. Reymann received an 
award of merit for being the best 
drilled cadet in the training camp, 
and the members of Company E're
ceived bars of merit for their ac
complishments in winning the com
petitive drill.

VAS YOU DERE?
It Is very doubtful if anyone missed the. Car
nival. At least so it seemed when one went to 
get ones coat at the check room. The Carnival 
committee Is certainly to be congratulated on the 
fine way in which they overcame the financial 
and climatic handicaps which beset them. Fergus 
and Co. spent a great deal of time and prepara
tion in giving Carnegie one of its finest Festivals 
in years and the results were accorded that allimportant hearty student approval on all three 
nights.* * * +
HEY DAY
Old Man Jupiter Pluvius put the kibosh on the 
R. O. T. C. Review and also made the Greeks 
postpone their sweepstakes for a few hours. 
When the race finally got under way Dutch Croft 
gave the Kappa Slgs a lead up the first hill and 
the opposing rooters got all lclnda goose pimples 
for fear that trim-looking rejuvenated Clyde 
Street buggy was going to roll. The K. S. cart 
did roll but Bill Dilks frictionless wonder, which 
is just about the smoothest thing on wheels 
around these parts, went away out in front going 
down the long grade and sewed things up again 
for the Betas.
The Theta Xis won the design cup again al
though the Delts had a snappy red and aluminum 
wagon which came close to taking the prize. 
This is only the fourth year in succession that 
tlie T. X.s have copped the design cup. Each 
year they complain that the award is getting 
smallerbetter get someone on that cup com
mittee next year boys.* * * *
GENTLEMEN (?) VS. STUDENTS (?) 
Great furor accompanied the faculty-senior 
musliball game, but the biggest surprise of all 
came last Tuesday when the score was published 
In the-. Tartan. The spectators were positive that 
no one kept score after the third inning. The 
seniors accused the faculty of general all-around 
cheating, bribing the alleged scorekeeper, taking 
five or six outs per inning and then quitting when 
they were ahead, but the silver grays won even 
if they did have to use some questionable strategy 
and after all, it isnt whether you won or lost 
that countsits whether you won.* * * *

HERO
We have a hero in our midst though hes too 
modest to claim the title or broadcast the facts. 
A student in the Building Construction Depart
ment (name furnished on request) decided to cut 
classes yesterday morning and take a stroll in 
the park. On his way across the Panther Hol
low bridge he noticed a girl climbing up the rail
ing. A man nearby rushed up to pull her back, 
but lie was getting the worst of the deal and it 
looked as though both were going over. Hero 
Building Construction, a muscular lad, rushed up 
and saved them both from destruction.

AFTERTHOUGHT
Did you hear the one about the officer taking a 
taxi to pull his box? Well, a few Beta boys did 
one better last, week when they grabbed a cab, 
went around the block, and hopped on a street 
car. Then theres one about the T. X. boys who 
threw a soft ball through a passing car wind
shield. They claim they are laying low for a 
while.
REMEMBER WHEN-?
this toam defended the honor of Carnegie Tech? The majority of us 
probably do not recognize all of the players, though some of us see 
one or two familiar faces. The first man on the left end of the rear 
row is Ralph Merrill, student manager of the team, and brother of 
Grace Merrill of the Student Employment office. Next to him stands 
York Cocken, and the last man in the rear row is Ray Rodgers, as
sistant student manager. Then In the front row, the first man on the 
left end is Walter Close, who is seated next to Alan Bright, now reg
istrar of his Alma Mater, and to whom we are indebted for this pic
ture; third in the front row is John Charles, captain of the team. Is 
his face familiar? It might well be; his son, John Scotty Charles 
36, is now attending Tech. Last on the front row is Ralph Leety, and 
there is at last one person to whom the picture is familiar; his daugh
ter, Marcia Ellen Leety, is a sophomore in the Drama Department.

U. S. Bureau of Mines on corrosion 
and its effects.
Late in 1916 he joined the A. M. 
Byers Company as consulting 
metallurgist, and has been identi

A. M. Byers Company, which has 
created a $10,000,000 plant at Ambridge for the manufacture of iron 
pipe by his process.
Professor Aston came to Carne

and metallurgy and head of this 
department. Since then he has 
given a considerable share of his 
time to educational worrk.
In recognition of his outstand

inventor, Professor Aston was 
awarded the Robert Woolston 
Hunt Gold Medal, given annually 
by the American Institute of Min

called the Italian aof such words 
as arm, father, palm, and 
far. This letter a is pronounc
ed with the mouth and throat open 
the tongue lax. It occurs most 
often before r but in calf 
half 'salve and the like, it is 
the accepted sound although an a 
which is longer in quantity and a 
little less open is also common in 
such words.
This letter a is the one that 
presents the problem. Many teach
ers of diction hold that the short 
'vowel of father is the only 
usage of educated people. Explain
ing the correct pronunciation, how
ever, Websters states that the 
a of staff, dance, com
mand, chant, ask, last," 
path, and the. like, is not the 
short form of the a in art. 
Rather, it is medium or long in 
quantity and variable in quality 
between the limits of a in art 
and a. in am, usually more 
nearly resembling the former, but 
articulated somewhat further for
ward in the mouth. It is used by 
many cultivated speakers in such 
words as are here mentioned, as a 
compromise between the a of 
art used by some and the a 
of am used by others.
It must be apparent that the 
discovering of what the exact 
usage is is very difficult. iSome 
cultivated speakers use the Ital
ian a; others use the flat a 
(am); and still others keep the 
sound somewhere between these 
two. It seems, therefore, that the 
taste of the individual speaker 
governs the correct pronunciation 
of the a which we have been 
discussingof course, within the 
extremes indicated.
An instructor in the Polytechnic 
Institute of Brooklyn tells his
classes that students should not
complain when they receive heavy 
assignments, because they are
really getting more for their
money.
