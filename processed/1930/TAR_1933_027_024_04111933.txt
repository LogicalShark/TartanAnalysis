Plans For 13 th 
Spring Carnival 
Near Completion
Plans for the Spring Carnival to 
be hold May 11-12-13, have nearly 
been completed. Committee meet
ings have been held, but details 
are being withheld until a later is
sue of the Tartan.
The price of the tickets has 
been tentatively set at $1.50. The 
Carnival events wiil in all prob
ability parallel those of last year.
The1 Spring Carnival was origin
ated in May, 1920, as an oppor
tunity for the students to have a 
holiday and a home-coming for the 
alumni. The faculty, petitioned for 
a weeks holiday, granted two days.
The first carnival included many 
of the stunts that are traditional 
today and many others that have 
almost been forgotten. The sweep
stakes, which played an important 
part of the Carnival, were then ac
companied by several handicaps. It 
was necessary to have the reaT 
wheels of the sweepstake buggies 
inter-changeable in order to stop 
in the middle of the race and -put 
the left wheel where the right 
.wheel belonged. Only four-wheel
ed cars were allowed to compete.
A circus was another feature of 
the first Carnival. Ferro, the iron
skinned, defied the points of a bed 
of spikes; a two-headed horse puz
zled those interested in biology; 
and a prehistoric man puzzled 
everyone.
The theme of the second Spring 
Carnival was a Mardi Gras cele
bration, and it was at this that the 
first campus queen was crowned 
and another tradition was born. 
This campus queen was chosen as 
now by the popular vote of the stu
dent body. Her picture appeared 
in the movie magazines and in the 
news reels all over the country. .
Many strange things appeared on 
our campus during those early 
Carnivals. In one an 88,000 candlepower search light graced the tow
er of Machinery Hall, and in anoth
er a 20-foot dragon guarded the ap
proach to the campus at the cut. 
In all of them, musical comedies, 
vaudeville shows, and melodramas 
played an important role. Famed 
among the early productions were 
The Blue Bandana, A Dispar
ate Woman, and The Devils 
Den.
The Carnival remained an affair 
for both students and alumni un
til 1927 when the Alumni Federa
tion Board voted to withdraw from 
Campus Week and to establish a 
new home-coming at the time of 
the Pitt football game. Since then 
it has been entirely in the hands 
of the students. That year a 
sweepstakes for the girls was start
ed and prizes were given to those 
who could round the curve near 
the Commons on rollerskatos with
out serious mishap. This year, too, 
the first prize was given for the 
best designed puslimobile.
The Carnival of 1928 inaugurat
ed the Coronation Ball which has 
been traditional ever since, but 
overstepped itself a little bit so 
that in the following year there was 
no celebration. In 1929 a petition 
was received from the student 
body and they were again given 
permission to have a Carnival.
Offer Reduced 
Railroad Rates
The Passenger Department 
of the Trunk Line Association 
has announced that reduced ex
cursion farefc have been author
ized by the leading railroads 
from Pittsburgh for college stu
dents, covering the spring vaca
tion period of 1933. A reduced 
fare of one and one-ninth of the 
one-way far for the round trip 
has been authorized./ Those 
wishing to take advantage of 
these reduced rates must secure 
from the registrars office an 
identification certificate for pre
sentation to the local ticket 
office. More detailed informa
tion is available at the general 
information desk in the Regis
trars office.

the twentieth annual Shakesperean 
production at Carnegie. The first 
production, Two Gentleman of 
Verona, was presented in 1914 
when the department was just a 
year old, under the direction of 
Donald Robertson. ' Since then 
nearly all of Shakespeares plays 
jhave appeared in the Little Thea
ter, and several have enjoyed re
vivals.
Mr. Payne returns each year as 
guest director to put on the Eliz

Physics Instructor 
Builds Detector
For the past year, Mr. J. W. 
Ballard, instructor in the Depart
ment of Physics, has been build
ing cosmic ray detectors in the 
physics laboratory. Miliilcan in 
America says these rays are waves 
given off when atoms are formed 
in interstellar space, the birth 
cry of matter. In England it is 
believed they are produced when 
atoms are destroyed, and so con
stitute the death knell of matter.
Mr. Ballard has a brass tube 
with a tungsten wire stretched 
along its axis and all sealed in a 
glass tube. The whole is evacuat
ed and filled with dry gas at low 
pressure. A 1,000-volt potential 
difference is applied between the 
wire and the cylinders. A current 
passes from the cyUnder to the 
wire when a cosmic ray passes 
through the tube.
Various experiments have found 
that cosmic ray detectors get 
sick and at the present time Mr. 
Ballard's best detector is sick. 
He hopes to have it in good condi
tion by next week. If so, those in
terested may hear cosmic rays ar
riving in the Physics Laboratory, 
Room 204, on exhibition night and 
see a neon tube flash as each 
cosmic ray passes through the de
tector tube.
Application Blanks Due 
At Employment Office
Mr. John D. Beatty of the Bu
reau of Recommendations urges 
seniors in the Colleges of Engi
neering and Industries who have 
not turned in their employment 
application blanks to do so imme
diately. The information request
ed is to be used not only by the 
emplo3rment bureau, but by those 
who will wish to have it for future 
reference.

with many of the greatest prints 
in the history of the graphic arts. 
Not only will all the important 
print makers of five centuries be 
represented, but the exhibition 
will also illustrate the different 
types of prints such as woodcuts, 
engravings, etchings, lithographs, 
mezzotints, dry points, and aqua
tints.
The exhibition is on the balcony 
of Sculpture Hall and in the four 
galleries on the second floor.

Coal R esearch 
Study Directed 
By Mr. Lowrey
'Tho work of tile Goal Ronoarch 
Laboratories, according to Mr. H. 
II. Lowry, tholr director, has boon 
almost ontlroly concerned with the 
Investigation of ono groat prob
lem, tho mochanlsin of tlio thermal 
decomposition of coal. Ho nays 
that a thorough understanding of 
this process should load to results 
of groat value slndo- thermal de
composition may bo regarded as a 
chemical process fundamental in 
tho utilization of coal. This un
derstanding Involves a knowledge 
of tho chomlcal constitution of tlio 
coal and It Is towards tills prob
lem of finding tlio chomlcal constit
uents that somo of tho Investiga
tors aro turning their efforts.
There aro two methods which 
aro generally employed to study 
tho chemical constitution oT coal. 
The first of these, which deals 
with the determination of tho 
structure of the complex coal mole
cule, resolves Itself Into a study 
of its roactions. The second is tlio 
study of the effects of tho thermal 
decomposition itself.
One of the most important reac
tions is that of oxidation which 
lias led to the discovery of much 
interesting information. A study 
of the oxidation products obtained 
at moderate temperatures has led 
to the viewpoint that coal may he 
regarded as a natural condensation 
resin of the general nature of 
bakelite resins. Lowry says, We 
are particularly interested in the 
mechanism of this mild oxidation 
and besides learning more about 
the constitution of coal from the 
study, we hope to understand .bet
ter the nature of spontaneous com
bustion and its possible control by 
the use of anti-oxidants which 
have been so successfully used in 
the rubber industry. If acidic 
enough there is also a possibility 
that these products may be used 
in the fixation of ammonia for use 
as fertilizer.
Thermai decomposition, the sec
ond means of determining chemic
al constitution, is less satisfactory 
because the products obtained that 
can be identified represent such a 
small per ce.pt of the original ma
terial. Distillation at very low 
pressure is one of the more im
portant methods of studying this 
decomposition. Because only low 
temperatures need he used linger 
a vacuum, the products formed are 
more nearly the primary prod
ucts of thermal decomposition, 
little breaking down of the com
plex molecules taking place.
Gas and coke being tho most 
Important by-products of thermal 
decomposition play a major part 
In the study of this procoss. Tho 
true densities of tho cokes under 
study are being found by a new 
method of displacement of gase
ous helium and a method for deter
mining a reactivity co-offlclent 
which Is truly dependent on the 
nature of the coke Is being devel
oped. A process by which coke 
oven gas can be enriched so as to 
approach natural gas in heat con
tent is another problem under in
vestigation at the Coal Research 
Laboratory. This may be of great 
value when the supplies of natural 
gas become depleted.
Mr. Lowry believes that the ex
tensive work being carried on is 
justified: he says, only when we 
get the most from coal will we get 
the most for coal.

Intramural Softball Games 
Start After Easter Recess
Betas Win Court 
Title by Beating 
K. S. in Playoff
Tho Betas eked out a 13-12 vic
tory over the Kappa Sigs for the 
championship of the intra-mural 
basketball league. The game was 
more of a football contest with 
Stewart, Sample, Croft, and Burns 
participating with much zest.
Ehrich was able to untangle 
himself often enough to gain high 
scoring honors among the Betas. 
That wasnt very often as the 
score, indicated, the young lad 
lacking about fifty pounds in his 
tussles with the gridmen.
In the Pitt-Tech playoff, the 
Betas dropped a slow and uninter
esting game to Phi Delta Theta, 
17-13. As in the case of most anti
climax games, the teams did not 
seem to have much appetite for 
the battle, the Betas being espe
cially off form. Carnegie took the 
runner-up honors, however, when 
Alpha Sigma Phi from the plaid 
institution stopped Alpha Phi 
Delta, 21-16.
Womens Athletics by Gloria KloosTHE
PLAID SPORTS 
SCREEN
Volleyball is more popular this 
season than ever before. Even the 
Seniors are playing every day at 
the noon practices. Sylvia Waide 
has announced mat mere will not 
be any practices held this week 
due to the fact that the Gym must 
be used for tap dancing classes. 
But a whole week of practices will 
be held prior to the class tourna
ments which will begin the week 
of May 1. Whether it is due to 
the coaching or not we dont know 
but the class teams this year are 
stronger than ever before and the 
champions will have a hard time 
defending their title.
Mitzie Gray has not yet heard 
what Carnegie's standing was in 
the recent Intercollegiate Matches, 
but judging from the practice times 
we think that it ought to be pretty 
good. Art School has several good 
swimmers this year in Jane Bell, 
lone Gaul and M,ary Martin all of 
whom placed in the match. Mitzie 
Gray, Veronica Kloos and Beth 
Lowrey were among those who 
represented Margaret Morrison in 
the swim.
Since the Fence has ignored list
ing all the notables present at the 
Swimming Party on April first 
maybe we can substitute for him. 
It was the best one yet and every
one is sorry to see the last one of 
these parties for the year. Marion 
McNary, Anne Warden, Mitzie 
Gray, Betty Preller, Hazel Grough, 
Pauline Bevand and Evelyn Gam
ble were there besides heaps and 
heaps of other people. Those who 
missed it may have an opportunity 
of attending a similar one at the. 
University of Pittsburgh next Wed
nesday afternoon. W. A. A. has 
been invited to send fifteen repre
sentatives to a unique pool party 
which will include games,- waterstunts and a parade..
The annual W. A. A. Awards 
Party will be held on May third. 
This party will be of special inter
est to Freshmen because it is 
given as an opportunity for them 
to meet the board members for 
next year and learn something 
about the program that they are 
planning. From all indications 
there will be only one letter 
awarded this year but there wilt 
be several pins and many numerals.
The recent siege of inclement 
weather has put the crimp in 
Coach Halfertys pre-season track 
program and unless the next few 
weeks contain some of those good, 
hot days no necessary to early 
spring condition, the opening meet 
with P. A. A. 1 going to leave 
some of the trackers pretty well 
winded at the end of their jaunts.
Less than two weeks remain un
til the first pistol shot rings out 
and starts another cinder campaign 
on I Is way. However, Carnegie's 
initial collegiate meet, that with 
Western Reserve, does not come 
up till the following Saturday, and 
the Tartan's first real test, when 
Geneva journeys here on May 13, 
Is more than a month away. Given 
a month, and remembering that 
other district teams are being 
hampered just as much as Carne
gie by the late spring, Captain 
Coulter and his mates feel confi
dent that they will bo set when 
the occasion demands.
Despite heavy losses via gradu
ation and ineligibilities, a com
fortable number of veterans and 
promising sophomores are strug
gling for places on the team. For 
the third successive year the team 
will he molded around its Olympic 
hurdler and present Captain Tom 
Coulter.

INTERCOLLEGIATE COMPETITION FOR CARNEGIE being at a 
atnndctlll, wc will have to confine our diocunoion in this column to lntcrfratcrnlty athletics of which there seems to bo an exceor, of material. 
Basketball soanon is over, and track and tennis have not started, so 
it is a bad time of the year for the sports department, or rather it 
would be if our Advertising Manager were not so energetic. But our 
business representatives arc on tho job and have taken most of our 
available space.
IT WILL PROBABLY BE OF CREAT INTEREST to many of our 
readers, especially some of. the alumni, to learn that Jimmy Robertson 
has recently been appointed head football coach of Geneva College, 
The former Tartan halfback was chosen from over a hundred applicants and II- 1 51,1 honor both to Jimmy and to the school to have 
him picked for the position. The ability of Robertson as a player is 
undisputed. His runs against Pitt and W. & .1. still stand out in the 
sport history of tills district; and he proved to be a nemesis to most 
all of his opponents, Robertson has had little experience as a coach, 
but with the aid of Gus Schmidt, former Plaid lineman, he should be 
able to carry out his duties at the Beaver Falls Institution almost as 
well as his predecessor, Howard Harpster. Well, Jimmy, we wish you 
luck.* * * * 
THE BETAS UPSET THE DOPE BUCKET when they defeated the 
Kappa Sigs 13-12 in the playoff for the intramural basketball cham
pionship. To say that the game was exciting is putting it in mild 
terms, A football contest was nothing beside that; as a matter of 
fact the A. A. is seriously considering holding the future football 
games in the gym and playing tho Interfraternity basketball contests 
in the stadium. It is much safer.
In the playoff with tho winners of the interfraternity basketball 
championship at Pitt, the Carnegie toam was defeated by Heller and 
Company of the Phi Delta Theta's by a 17-13 score. However, the 
Alpha Sigma Phi's evened things up by scoring a 21-16 victory over the 
Alpha Phi Deltas who were the Pitt runner ups.* * * * *
THE S. A. E.s ONCE AGAIN WON THE INTRAMURAL WREST
LING championship, nosing out the Theta Xis by five points. Harry 
McCurdy of football fame proved just as competent on the mat as on 
the gridironas most of his opponents will tell you. Mac was crowned 
champion of the 165-pound clasB. NBlll Kulesz was the other point 
scorer for tho winners; the former boxer being the leader in the Im
pound class. The Theta Xis produced three champions but failed to 
score as many points as the victors. Their three winners were: 
Clinger in tho 135-pound; Cadmus in the 1-15-pound, and Foresman in 
tho unlimited classes. Hollingsworth of the Pi Kappa Alphas suc
ceeded in copping tho 125-pouncJ division, and Tantum of the Kappa 
Sigs received the title in the 175-pound class.W * + * 9
DIRECTLY AFTER EASTER THE SOFTBALLERS will be found run
ning around the cut and utilizing every spare square foot of ground in 
their attempt to get into shape for the coming season. Schedules for 
the leagues will be passed out at a meeting of the representatives on
Tuesday, April 18. There will be several changes in the rules and in
the method in which the sport will be conducted this year. Each team 
will be composed of the regulation ten man team instead of nine men 
as was the case formerly. The action of the representatives in adopt
ing the use of members of the various organizations entered, to act as 
umpires, is very commendable. Opponents of the movement have said 
that the students would not be capable {ind that it would cause many 
disputes and III feeling between the fraternities. We believe any 
group of college men should be able to accept the decision of one of 
their fellow students. If they cant, It would show that the real pur
pose of Intramural athletics is a failure, at Carnegie, and it would be 
best to break up tho league.

HEN we started to make Granger 
Rough Cut we knew that fine tobac
co burnt hot because it burnt so fast. It 
kept your pipe hot. You could hardly 
hold your pipe in your hand, it got so 
hot at times.
Then we remembered that some folks 
back yonder used to "whittle their to
bacco. So we made GRANGER just like 
"whittle tobacco  "Rough Cut. It 
smokes cooler and lasts a lot longer. Arid 
also, youll find it never gums the pipe.
So far, so good. Now we wanted to sell 
this tobacco for 10c. Good tobaccoright 
processcut right. It was a question of 
how to do it for the price.
So we pul GRANGER in a sensible soft 
foil pouch instead of an expensive package, 
knowing that a man cant smoke a package. 
We gave smokers this good GRANGER 
tobacco in a coinmon-sense pouch for 10c.
GRANGER has not been on sale very 
long, but it has grown to be a popular 
smoke. And there is this much about it 
we have yet to know of a man who 
started to smoke it, who didnt keep on. 
Folks seem to like it.

Exclvange Servicetyping by wireis an example.
For some years Private Wire Teletypewriter Ser

Due to the Easter Recess no 
night classes will be in session 
Thursday or Friday evenings, 
April 13 and 14, of this week. 
All classes will resume as usual 
on Monday evening, April 17, 
next week.
Something entirely new and different is promised the Night Arts 
students for their next social function to be held late this month. But 
before the program under consideration can be completed a May Queen 
must be found. To do this the Night students in the Arts School are 
asked to cast their votes for the girl they wish to bestow this honor 
upon.
This is the first time a contest of this nature has been attempted 
in the night school and considerable enthusiasm has been aroused con
cerning this innovation.
The contest rules are simple, only Night Art students are allowed 
to vote, only Night School girls are eligible as candidates for the honor 
and all voters must sign their names on the ballot cast.
Clip the ballot printed below, or make one of your own, and drop 
it in the inter-school mail box on or before Wednesday, April 19.

Mendelssohn Choir to 
Sing Next Tuesday
The Mendelssohn Choir will pre
sent a concert Tuesday evening, 
April IS at Carnegie Music Hall. 
The featured selection of the eve
ning will be 'Belchazzars Feast" 
by William Walton, a young Eng
lish composer of modern music. 
"Belchazzars Feast was presented 
last Saturday by the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra under the direc
tion of Cusovesky. Its presenta
tion by the Mendelssohn Choir will 
be its ,second occurrence in this 
country. "Gods Time is This" by 
Johanne Sebastian Bach, a cantata 
will also be rendered.
The Mendelsohn Choir is com
posed largely of trained voiees un
der the direction of Mr. Ernest 
Lunt. Earl Michel will accompany 
the choir at the organ.
Its one thing to be a good 
imitator, and its another thing to 
try to imitate and fail. In the last 
issue of the Tartanthe foolish 
number of April 4, somebody tried 
to imitate my style but the- dis
guise was hopeless. You could 
read between the lines, and what 
lines they were, Ill leave it to you 
to guess. If the author got any 
real pleasure from saying some
thing out of nothing, Ill take my 
hat off to him, but I wonder?
The champion night, school long 
distance traveler has not yet been 
found, at least the letters received 
so far have shown no one travel
ing any great distance as compared 
with last years record. But the 
contest goes merrily on.
Letters are coming in each week 
which will pile up a mass of fig
ures and will show how much 
energy is being consumed by night 
school students in traveling. Sort,

our own. Maybe after it is all 
over well give our findings to the

its third week and we feel that as
BALLOT
NIGHT ARTS MAY QUEEN
Theyre the largest water-wheel generators 
ever built. Incidentally, it was some achieve
ment. considering the enormous weights, to 
ship the G-E generators and transformers 
nearly 6000 milesand then to put them in
to operation successfully. Even engineering 
veterans were astonished.
Running all through the issue, 
as if propelled by the same force, 
one could read into the lines, 
"caution, or some such controlling 
factor. Was this the result of the 
new deal one hears so much about 
these days, or is it the old deal in 
disguise, turned upside down, when 
one really finds out whos what, 
and whats who without even as 
much as batting an eyelash.
Night Industries 
Holds 2nd DanceDIDJA NOTICE
THAT . . . whew . . . are 
we dizzy over that outburst
last week . . . oh! me ... it 
was a lot of fun though . . . 
hope you liked it . . . and
didnt take it too seriously . . . 
we must have our fun, you
know . . . anyhow, the farm 
situation in Punxsutawney is 
all settled now.
THAT everybody seems to be 
enjoying (?) the present lull in 
social activities just now.
THAT the Industries romance 
of not so many moons ago has 
now become a triangle with the 
Arts School finally becoming 
involved in it.
THAT the Bunny is working 
over time just now for all 
youse boys and all youse gals.
THAT April 7 was all wet, 
beer-ly speaking, as far as the 
weather was concerned.
THAT were going to get a 
vacation this week-end. Here is 
a good tip, use it to catch up on 
some of that night work you 
have been neglecting; you know 
the kind I mean.
THAT robins are filling the 
air with song these several days 
back. Telling us all about the 
wonderful spring weather com
ing our way, donja know.
THAT claimants for the trav
eling championship are falling 
over each other the last few 
days.
THAT the notorious arts lady 
has been showered with affec
tion by a number of the canine 
family. This makes a certain 
guy . see green, whereupon he 
proceeds to show that hes a 
man for a that.
THAT thats that, and Ill be 
seenya.
COUNTING COSMIC HAYS
Wo hear a lot about cosmic rays, but know 
little about them. Some believe the rays aro 
the birth erics of new matter, photons, which 
arc like light rays. Others believe theyre 
electrons, the death rattle of matter as it 
radiates itself away. But whatever the rays 
are, they come to us from every direction, 
night and day.
One of our engineers, Chester liice, a MO grad 
of Harvard,.didnt think cosmic rays were so 
mysterious. He even perfected a device to 
count them. Imaginecounting cosmic rays! 
lie counts them with a nickel cylinder de
tector that is suspended in a low-pressure 
tube. Its shielded by a housing of lead, 'I in. 
thick, to keep out the effects of radioactive 
material. The rays, passing into the cylinder, 
initiate corona discharges, which are fed into 
an amplifier, then through a radio loud
speaker. The rays can be heard as distinct 
clicks. The small cylinder has a count of eight 
rays per minute
The function scheduled to be 
held by the Night College of Indus
tries on April 22 has been changed 
to a dance instead of the usual 
smoker.
Plans are shaping up for a suc
cessful affair, and more details will 
be published in the next issue of 
the Tartan.
The last dance held by the Night 
College of Industries was such a 
success that the officers decided to 
change the remaining  smoker to 
another dance as this seemed to 
be the popular choice.
Pending final arrangements, 
which will be announced later, the 
students registered in the Night 
College of Industries should mark 
the date on their social calendar 
and make arrangements to be 
present on April 22 next.
SENIORS
About the only legitimate things 
in the issue "were the ads. One 
could read these and know that 
they really meant what they said. 
For instance we have the tobacco 
ad which shows the big gun 
stopping a cannon ball to the edi
fication of an audience of several 
hundred people. Or if you were on 
the verge of pulling a boner, all 
you need to do is smoke a good 
brand of weed. Sure itll light up.
MEET THE PIIANOTRONS
Boston, proud guardian of the Beans and the 
Cods, has been harboring another celebrated 
family, lately. The name is Phanotron; [resent 
condition, that of lusty infancy; job, rectifying 
alternating current.
Housed in the Salem Street substation of the 
Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 
downtown Boston, this equipment is chang
ing alternating current at 13,800 volts, 3-phase, 
60 cyclcs, into direct current at 238 volts. 
Listed advantages: no moving parts, silent 
operation, high efficiency, economy in lloor 
space. Six tubes, with a combined rating of 600 
amperes, are employed. They are an outgrowth 
of the vacuum tube used in radio sets, hut 
have a current capacity 100,000 times greater. 
The Phanotron rectifier, a highly desirable 
neighbor, comes from good old G-E stock, in
cubated in the Research Laboratory in Sche
nectady. Incidentally, Harry Steiner, a Uni
versity of Kansas grad of 26, is largely 
responsible for its engineering ami design 
development.
Order Your Degree Rings
Large Ring, 10K Gold.............
Small Ring, 10K Gold.............And then, believe it or not, a 
number of students were observed 
to. have inverted the last page to 
get a birds eye view of the cow 
crossing Fifth avenue. Of course, 
this was done when nobody was 
expected to be lookinghow we 
mortals can be deceived, and I 
,<lont mean maybe.
Rings paid for in full before May 15 will be delivered on Com
mencement Day.
Deposits of $*1.00 on the large rings and $2.f>0 on the small 
rings will he required on all orders. Rings on which deposits 
only are made will be mailed C. O. D. for the remainder of the 
cost after graduation.
Night Staff Aids In 
Organic ing New Paper
The night student paper staff 
was gratified to receive a request 
from the staff of the "Ys Owl, 
the paper of the Y. M. C. A. de
pression college, to aid in the re
organization of their working units. 
The kind attentions shown to the 
representative of your paper who 
attended were much appreciated. 
It was a real pleasure to aid these 
students in their efforts to create 
a newspaper in the face of 1 the 
same difficulties that faced the 
night students when they under
took the task of editing their own 
page. It is to be hoped that con
tinued success will attend their re
organized staff, and that their 
paper will be widely read* and ap
preciated during the period that 
the "depression college exists.
The problems with which the 
students of the depression college 
have to deal are very similar to 
those of the night student. Their 
efforts to create a group of activi
ties and to edit their own school 
paper certainly indicates that while 
they may be theoretically down, 
they are certainly not out.
DNEPROSTROY
On October 10th last, the largest masonry dam 
ever built was dedicated in Russia. Its part 
of the tremendous Dneprostroy hydroelectric 
development. There, Charles Thomson, who 
completed his engineering course in 13 at the 
South African School of Mines, Johannesburg, 
Transvaal, was honored by the U.S.S.R. He 
received the Order of the Red Banner of 
Labor for his nkill. His had beim the job of 
erecting all the electric apparatus. And Home 
job it was!
As a construction engineer for General Elec
tric, he spent 18 months iu Russia. Ho pul 
into operation the nine enormous 77,500-kv-a. 
generators, five of which were built by G.E.
The urge for education is such 
that even the foot treads of time 
leave their imprint. This fact was 
brought to my mind in a very con
crete fashion the other evening 
when I had occasion to ascend from 
the first lloor to the second by 
means of a stairway located in the 
older section of the Industries Col
lege. Midway between the flight, 
is a landing, and what do you sup
pose has , happened. Just this. 
That the constant urge for educa
tion, little by little, has worn away 
that stone slab until nothing re
mains but a hole. This is remark
able in so far as no one would sus
pect that the human foot would 
finally erode a stone slab jiist as 
nature does.

Faculty Co-operation Needed
Several months ago the Interfratemity Council net aside 
tliis week and next as the period which would be recommended 
to the .fraternities as a time when initiations should lie held. 
It was felt that greater co-operation could be secured from the 
faculty in the matters of giving examinations and heavy assign
ments during this period. In .adopting the uniform period, the 
council hoped to place it at a time when work could be light
ened and, by urging 1 lie fraternities to hold their initiations 
during this period, to eliminate some of the usual disturbances 
that interrupt classroom work during a prolonged period.
Not all of the groups will hold initiations during these two 
weeks, but a good many will and it will be most encouraging 
to the council members to know that the faculty are co-operat
ing with them.
George P. \Vasmuth Jr.
George AVasmuth has set up his last tripod and has worked 
his last math problemhis slide rule and. his log book lie on 
his desk undisturbed. Last Thursday George died from a blood 
infection in the Presbyterian Hospital. A junior in the,De
partment of Civil Engineering where he had achieved success 
in his work, George had many friends among the students and 
faculty.More than a week ago it was necessary to make a blood 
transfusion in an effort to save his life. One oil the finest dem
onstrations of human sacrifice and sympathy was shown by resi
dents of the mens dormitories that day. In less than an hour 
after the need was known, thirty-one men had reported at the 
hospital to donate what blood they could to save Georges life. 
The esteem in which he was held in the eyes of his friends could 
not be more adequately demonstrated. And one will have to 
go far to And a more splendid spirit and display of human 
sacrifice than that shown by tho thirty-one boys who were will
ing to give their blood to help George fight a most gnawing 
enemy.

SORRY
We slipped up on the April first boys because 
of the nature of last week's issue. When we 
turned the column over to someone else for the 
week, we forgot to tell them that the secret of 
Harold Pressmans peculiar behavior during the 
past three years had finally been discovered. Its 
a fact he was born on April First. They crowned 
him King for the Day at the Beta Sigma Rho 
mansion.
The D. U. freshman had different ideas about 
how an April Fool should be treated. When they 
discovered that Carl Boehme was another year 
old on that day of all fools, out came the hose 
and Carl.

change in season had come to pass was brought 
about by observing the changing fashions. For 
further details see Reldy.

THE MAN HUNT
The husband - hunting, young woman is not 
going to be caught napping, the headlines of a 
recent article in the evening paper boldly an
nounced in conjunction with the pictures of sev
eral of Carnegie's better known co-eds.
Dorothy Robinson, Ruth Nye, Marjorie Wittaker and Gloria Kloos were the. victims of this 
pre-Mortar Board dance announcement. The 
whole gist of the story is that the girls are learn
ing to cook and sew over at the Practice House. 
The writer forgot to mention some of the other 
advantages of practicing home making, didnt she, 
Gloria? Well, the story gave the wife-hunting 
young man a chance to find out that some girls 
are still interested in cooking and sewing. Thats 
something!*****

Its the Woman Who Pays was the slogan at 
Thistle Hall last Friday when the Mortar 
Boards sponsored a you ask him for a change 
dance. Many of the girls made the evening com
plete by making the boy friend ride in the 
family buggy instead of his own.
The dance was quite a success and you've got 
to hand it to the Mortar Boards for getting a real 
idea. Prominent among those present were the 
sister Mortar Boards from Pitt. Our betterknown campus couples were also in evidence 
Marg Daugherty and Jim Deely, Betty Cooper and 
Slcippy Mitchell, and Gloria with Jimmy, Marian 
McNary with Jimmy Traaa, Betty Preller, Kay 
Whooley and the rest ol the Motor Boats in full 
force
Charley McCormicks music, deviated from the 
soft, sophisticated style to the snappier tunes of 
the day, and even Emil Stankey and Marg Griffen 
(they arrived too late to be named in the preced
ing paragraph) proclaimed the band o. k.
AND MORE
The same uiglit the Mellon Unit gave their 
annual Spring Formal (remember the snow),

Among those present were Robby of Bill and 
Robby fame, Barnacle Bill Miller just returned 
as an able-bodied seaman, Alden Hutchison and 
John Liglitfoot, our budding young commercials, 
Ted Zenlc, Harold Cadmus, and Bill Holliday 
all making the hearts of certain sweet young 
things skip beats. Boots Kelley of It's a beau
tiful day fame, was sporting a'brand new cham
pionship medal for the evening.

tem remove
rom the tobaccos use
mCl,ester
That's a very simple question to answer. 
The stem in a tobacco leaf, like the stem 
in most other plants, is "wood)'. It hasnt 
any of the flavor or the aroma that you 
want }vhcn you smoke. And it doesnt 
burn right.
So after tobacco has been properly aged, 
one of the first things to do is to remove 
the stems.
But what has this to do with your enjoy
ment of Chesterfield cigarettes? Just this, 
it means that we start right when we make 
Chesterfieldthe right kind of leaf with 
the stem removed, the right manufacture 
 everything that science knows that can 
make CHESTERFIELD a milder cigarette, a 
cigarette that tastes better.
Thats why people say They Satisfy.
