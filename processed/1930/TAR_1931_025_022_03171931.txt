SENIORS MUST TURN 
IN PICTURES AT ONCE
Five Companies Schedule 
Their Interviews For 
March 18 to 25
Seniors who.have not turned in picjtures to the Bureau of Recommend
ations, are warned that a small 
matter like this may cost them a 
position. . This year probably more 
than ever before promptness will 
be a deciding factor in the- choice 
of candidates for positions.
Recently several seniors were 
asked for pictures which were to 
be forwarded to a company. The 
last of the pictures were turned in 
a week later, after much urging by 
the Bureau. Business men do not 
.tolerate such delinquency in' their 
own organizations, and do not ex
pect it from men who are in quest 
of positions with their companies. 
Seniors are urged strongly, there
fore, to keep your appointments on 
the dot, return application forms 
promptly, and give any information 
or data as soon as they are able 
to obtain it. Nothing makes an 
impression on a business man so 
much as being business-like.
Interviews are scheduled with 
companies according to the follow
ing dates: General Electric (Com
mercial), Wednesday, March 18; 
American Steel and Wire Co., Wed
nesday, March 18; Standard Oil of 
N. Y., Thursday, March 19; Leeds 
and Northrup, Friday, March 20; 
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., Wed
nesday and Thursday, March 25 and 
26.
The Bureau has also received 
inquiries from several additional 
companies concerning Seniors. The 
Bailey Meter Company will receive 
Applications from Mechanicals until 
March 21. Details and blanks may 
be obtained at the .Employment 
Bureau. Union Carbide and its 
Subsidiaries has openings for Chcmkals, Metallurgists, and Mechani
cals. The National Tube Company 
of McKeesport "will send application 
blanks in the near future for its Training .Course, 1
Scabbard And Blade 
Will Hold Smoker
Scabbard and Blade, the na
tional military honorary society, 
.will hold its annual smoker for 
all members of the local Re
serve Officer Training Corps in 
the Carnegie Union on Wed
nesday, March 18, at 7:30 in the 
evening. It is held each year 
for the purpose of promoting 
and encouraging military train
ing among the students. Among 
the speakers are Major Hub
bard of the Ninety-ninth Divi
sion of Calvary, and Colonel 
Fairley of Carnegie T ech. In 
addition there will be moving 
pictures. Refreshments will be 
served and smokes furnished.  
There is no admission and all 
members of the local unit are 
urged to attend.
Y.M.&W.H.A. TO OFFER 
CLASSIC MELODRAMA 
ON MARCH 24-25-26
Y Playhouse to Present 
Around the World in 
Eighty Days
With all its classic melodrama, 
which includes an Indian attack 
upon a train, a ship wreck, the 
burning of a Hindu widow on a 
funeral pyre, Around the World 
in Eighty Days will be presented 
at the Y. M. and W. H. A. Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday, 
March 24, 25 and 26.
The play-, is adapted from the 
novel by Jules Verne by Wood 
Stevens, former head of the Drama 
Department at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology and director of the 
Goodman Theater, Chicago.
B. Iden Payne, who took part in 
the play when it was produced by 
the Goodman Theater with great 
success and popular approval, will 
play the lead.
Mrs. Frank Wertheimer will be 
the entracte soloist who will give 
the play the old-time melodramatic 
atmosphere by singing the senti
mental ballads of 1872. A male 
chorus will sing several sturdier 
barroom ballads and dances of the 
vintage of 1872 are to be included. 
There will also be an ensemble of 
fifty voices. An outline of the play 
follows:
Philcas Fogg, an Englishman, 
belongs to a famous" club of ec
centrics. Membership to this so
ciety depends on the applicants 
ability to do at least one ultraeccentric deed.
A robbery had just occurred in 
the Bank of England and in the 
club that evening Phileas makes 
the statement thar the robbers can 
easily escape. He says that the 
world has grown small and can be 
circled in eighty days.
This statement is challenged by 
his fellow members whereupon 
Phileas makes' a $5,000,000 wager

Three Honoraries 
Plan To Replace 
Scholarship Cup
Carnegie honorary fraternities, 
Tau Beta Pi, Alpha Tau, and Tau 
Sigma Delta are making plans to 
replace the scholarship cup which 
is now in the permanent possession 
of Alpha Rho Chi. A similar cup 
is annually presented to the frater
nity with the highest scholastic 
standing. This fraternity r.ctains 
the cup permanently if it is earned 
for three consecutive times; other
wise it must be given up when an
other fraternity earns the right to 
hold it.
A high spirit of rivalry exists 
between Carnegie fraternities in re
gard to the holding of the cup as 
it is an open recognition of the 
scholastic ability of their members. 
These honorary fraternities select 
their members from the highest 
ranking men in the College of In
dustries, College of Engineering, 
and the Arts School.
Tau Beta Pi will make its spring 
call during Campus Week. It is 
rumored that the local chapter of 
Tau Beta Pi has invited the na
tional chapter to hold its annual 
convention at Carnegie next fall. 
If the desire is realized, the stu
dents of Carnegie next fall will 
have a chance to acquaint them
selves with men who are attending 
other schools throughout the coun
try, thus broadening their outlook 
and enlarging the number of their 
acquaintances.
The election to an honorary or 
professional fraternity means pub
lic recognition of exceptionally fine 
work in the field from which the 
honorary chooses its members. 
This fact should be an incentive 
for students at Carnegie to do their 
utmost in their ^school work so 
that they may reap the benefits 
to be derived by close association 
with men of high scholastic stand
ing.

Pricc Stabilization Problems 
Continue
.Within the last week James C. 
Stone, who replaces Mr. Lcggc as 
chairman of the Federal Farm 
Board, announced a continuation of 
the Farm Boards pojicy of pricc 
stabilization in the wheat market. 
The Farm Board is the Republican 
Partys solution for agricultural de
pression. If its success or failure 
tests the partys ability to solve an 
economic problem of first rate na
tional importance, the projeed will 
bear examination.
. The object of stabilization by 
governmental intervention whether 
by the Farm Board or other agency 
is to bolster up'prices by withhold
ing goods from the market. The 
methods employed run all the wav 
from government purchases of sur
plus production to the discourage
ment of production itself. Such a 
manipulation of supply and demand 
is supposed to put a sick industry 
on its feet even in these days when 
the strongest are staggering under 
the burden of overproduction.
The Farm Board introduces no 
new principles in stabilization. Sim
ilar schemes have often been tried 
and have frcqucntljr failed. After 
the war, stabilization first caught 
the worlds attention when the 
British launched the now famous 
Stevenson Rubber Restriction 
scheme in 1923. At that time rub
ber production by expanding from 
80,000 tons in 1910 to about 600,000 
tons in 1923 had outrun consump
tion at remunerative prices! The 
British Governments solution for 
low prices and overproduction was 
also stabilization.
Under the Stevenson plan,, pro
hibitive duties were placed on ex
ports of rubber from British planta
tion in excess of a fixed # quota. 
Since British owned plantations con
stituted 75 per cent of the total 
area devoted to plantation rubber, 
Britain controlled a majority of the 
production.
Mr. Stevenson estimated that this 
restriction of supply would main
tain prices at a higher level than 
the 21-ccnt price then prevailing 
and that by 1930, demand would

Drama Students 
, To Present Four 
Plays, March 19-21
Productions Written and 
Staged By Drama 
Students
The Drama department will pre
sent a bill of four original one-act 
plays in the Little Theater on
Thursday and Friday nights and
Saturday afternoon, March 19, 20 
and 21. These plays were written 
in th.c playwriting class conducted 
by Professor Chester M. Wallace. 
They arc being staged by the au
thors under Mr. Wallaces general 
direction. Those that have been
chosen for production arc "Even 
You, Giovanni, by Barnabas 
Dierics, who wijf be rcincriibcrcd 
for his play, Two Cheeks To
Slap, given carlicri in the season; 
Gun Play, by John Wilkoff; 
Children of Nobility, by  Burtt 
McKee, and The Afternoon of a 
Movie Star, by R'ichard Burrell.
The general conccption of the 
work done in the Drama depart
ment is that training is given only 
in the technique of acting and in 
production work. For those who 
arc interested, this work of playwriting is just as important as the 
other. It is valuable as well when, 
as an actor menfber of a company, 
one who has had the training given 
in this course, can tell the value 
of a play and judge its possibilities 
in production. Having had prac
tice in writing plays himself, the 
actor can sympathetically analyze 
an authors work, and can crcatc 
an understanding between himself 
and the author, the lack of which 
is the cause of so many near fail
ures in the course of staging a 
play.
This class has every year put 
on a program of one-act plays, 
and this years selection includes 
a wide enough variety of themes 
so that the audicnccs should be 
large. This time the plays arc 
given for the campus alone and 
plenty of tickets will be available..

Leon S. Moisseif, consulting en
gineer from New York City, will 
discuss the Kill van Kull Arch 
this evening at S :30 oclock in the 
Carnegie Union.
Mr. Moisseif is a graduate in 
civil engineering from Columbia 
University, class of 1S95. After 
graduation lie spent 18 years with 
the Department of Bridges of the 
City of New York, 12 years of 
which were spent in cliargc of 
plans and designs of 'bridges. The 
Manhattan and Quccnsboro bridges, 
the plans for the reconstruction of 
the Brooklyn bridge, and the 
strengthening of the Williamsburg 
bridge arc -some of his outstanding 
works during this period.
Sincc he began his consulting 
engineering practice in 1915, Mr. 
Moisseif has been engaged in the 
planning and construction of many 
large and well known bridges 
throughout the country. Among 
them may be listed the Delaware 
River bridge, the Ambassador 
bridge, and the Golden Gate bridge.
At present lie is employed as 
advisory engineer to the Port of 
New York Authority on the Hud
son River and the Kill van Kull 
bridges; as consulting engineer for, 
the Commissariat of Transportation, 
U. S. S. R., and for the Chicago 
Worlds Fair Exposition of 1933,
On Thursday, March 19, at 8:30 
p. m., there will also be a lccturc

Woman Politician To 
Lecture Tonight At 
Y. M. And W. H. A.
Mrs. Belle Moscowitz, popularly 
known as one of the outstanding 
women politicians of the country, 
will lccturc on Women in the 
World of Politics this evening at 
the Y. M. and W. H. A. 'audi
torium on Bcllcficld avenue.' Mrs. 
Moscowitz, in addressing her . first 
Pittsburgh audience, will try to 
show that parents of today will 
have grounds to liopc^ to see the 
pictures of their daughters on $5 
bills. To prove this, she will call 
upon the experience of her many 
years in local and national political 
arenas.
The qualities which led to Mrs. 
Moscowitz/s advancement arc those 
popularly supposed to be exclusive-' 
ly masculine. She has often 
demonstrated her capacity for capa
ble, efficient management in pol
itics, in social service work, and 
in industrial mediation. She' has 
become widely known because of 
her work as publicity director of 
the Democratic National Commit
tee during A1 Smith's campaign fpi1 
the Presidency. Ever sincc that 
time her services have been widely 
sought as a speaker.
Mrs. Moscowitzs political carccr 
dates back to the days when woman 
suffrage was the countrys most 
dominant issue. Through hcr, A1 
Smith, then a ncwcomcr in politics 
on a big scale, lent his support 
to her project. In return, lie got 
the backing of many influential 
women of New York City. Smith 
and Mrs. Moscowitz remained cloSc 
friends during all his campaigns for 
governor, and she served his ad
ministration at various times in 
the roles of, social service secretary, 
and of secretary of a labor dispute 
bo^rd.
In the latter position she was 
instrumental in aiding the governor 
in settling several serious strikes 
which occurred at that time. In 
the recent Presidential campaign 
Mrs. Moscowitz kept her place as

dominant note has been Scotch.- The 
propaganda of something being dif
ferent has been heard many times, 
in many places, orr many subjects, 
but this time the Thistle editors 
mean it. It will be more full of 
news, . concerning student life and 
campus happenings with campus pic
tures in an effort to stressschool 
spirit.
It is being kept a secret to whom 
the Thistle has been dedicated. The 
editor wishes to keep this bit of 
information unknown until as late 
as possible.
Athletics will feature as a large 
part of the 1931 edition. Graphs of 
four major football games arc some
thing new. There will be the' usual 
write ups of the various activities, 
and pictures of classes, committees 
and teams. Much of the material has 
gone to press but there arc still 
some organizations who arc delay
ing the completion of the work, which 
is in charge of Sam JWilson, as 
Editor, and Ray Knopf, Business 
Manager.
The soliciting and selling of ad
vertisements is proceeding splendid
ly under the direction of Ray 
Knopf. With the backing that these 
ads -will give the publication, it re
mains only for the Student Body to 
add its support.
The cover, usually the most prom
inent feature of the Year Book, will 
be novel since  Thistle symbols arc 
appropriately employed with modern
istic painting. The price of this 
years Thistle is $5, which will be 
taken by subscription. _

memorable than before.
ARTS BALL PARTY TO 
BE HELD THURSDAY
Sculptors and Decorators To 
Be Hosts At Dance 
In Mud Room
The bi-annual Arts Ball is well 
under way. Tickets arc selling 
with an amazing rapidity and there 
is every sign that the committee in 
chargc of decorations, under the 
leadership of Ralph Kruck, will 
soon be nailing wood and splash
ing paint in the foyer. For those 
who arc already planning their 
costumes, it is suggested that any 
vivid Moorish color might be used, 
such as blue, red, yellow, green 
and gold. The prize sketches of 
decorations for an Arts Ball will 
be on display in the small exhibi
tion room. These sketches were 
chosen from a group submitted for 
competition by the students in the 
Department of Architecture and In
terior Decoration.
The orchestras under considera
tion arc Dan Gregory, Tom Carr 
and Zac White. All of which in
dicates that the' music will be good 
at any cost.
The series of teas which the 
various departments have sponsor
ed in connection with the ball arc 
proving to be successful in promot
ing a more social feeling between 
the various groups in the school. 
The first of these teas was given ' 
in the Round Table Room by the 
Drama Department, at which Miss 
Schrader poured. The second tea 
was given in the form of a punch 
party under the P. and D. sky
light; punch and cookies were 
served. An enthusiastic group at
tended. They were congenial in 
the atmosphere of cxcitcmcnt and 
informal surroundings of the paint
ing studio.
The Sculptors and Decorators arc 
entertaining Thursday at four-thirty 
in the mud room. Rootbccr and 
pretzels arc to be served in this 
beautiful room (that is, beautiful 
after several layers of mud are re
moved and the easels pushed back). 
With refreshments of this calibre, 
everyone is assured a happy hour or 
two.

SEVERAL SCRIBES apparently did not agree with Captain Nesses All-Opponent selection in that lie named but one 
Pitt man, Eddie Baker, on his second team. During- the past' 
season, the Tartans met several of the best tea'ms in tills dis
trict and in the east, and showed up w6ll against them. N'ease who certainly knows Jjaskdtball well enough to spot an outstand
ing performer when in action against him, named men whose 
performance against the Plaids would justify their berths on the All-Opponent team. It seems strange that his selection can
not stand without mild apologies for not placing more Pitt men among the mnking opponents of the year.

BERT POUNCEYS SHOWING against Joe Moran of 
Syracuse was evidentally better than most fans considered it, even though the referee stopped the fight 
toward the middle of the second round. Fightin Joe recently added Davis, Navys middleweight, to his record of consecutive knockouts 
to bring the total to thirteen. Whats more, 
Pouncey lasted longer than several of Morans 
other victims.It is also interesting to note that the Syra
cuse boxers defeated the Navy mitt-men, 4-3,
arid that the points scored were all in the lighter weights, just as 
Simmons* men worked- it at Carnegie. Incidentally, Syracuses 
victory was the first to be scored against Navy in the past 
twelve years.* * * * *
THOSE PLEBE SWIMMERS OF OURS added the fin- i ishing touches to an already successful season by adding three
more victories to their string during the past week. In additionto trouncing the mermen From Schenley and I/angley Iiighs, 
the yearling splashers accomplished a feat none of their prede
cessors have been able to achieve when they downed the strong 
Kiski Prep teaim
Just prior to the final meet Harry Miller was elected Captain of the team. Harry is a star performer in the 50 and J.00 
yard frec-style events and is looked upon as the man to fill the shoes of Captain Bill "Redding, who is the only man the 
varsity squad loses this year.
Several other members of the Plebe team can be counted 
on to; furnish plenty of competition for 'varsity berths next 
season and the strongest team in Carnegie history is not un
likely. It also happens that next' season will be our first, in the Intercollegiate Swimming Association.

meet has not been taken as seriously in the past as it should 
be, with the result that a few teams generally capture all the 
liohors.
This year, Coach Halferty has hopes of uncovering a few promising men in this meet and will have his eyes on the quar- tcr-milcrs and broad-jumpers in particular. Heres a chance for unknowns to break into track.

PROSPECTIVE CHAMPIONS ARE IN VIEWin each 
of the three leagues of the I. F. D. B. B. L. But one team remains undefeated in each circuit as the teams pass the halfway mark.
Welch Holl remains on top in the National League having 
been ijclle during the past week. The Pi K.A.s strong team took undisputed possession of first place in their league by 
downing last years champs, the Betas, 21-20 in a thrilling overtime contest. In the Federal League the Kappa Sigs kept 
their hold on the top rung when the handed the S.A.E. boys their first defeat 26-21.
The brand of ball played this year lias been typical of the leagues of the past and many closely contested contests arc in 
prospect during the coming weeks with a concentrated effort being centered on unseating the league leaders.
President Jalonack has called an important meeting of the 
team managers for this afternoon at 4:30 in the Trophy Room. 
Every team is urged to have a representative at the meeting as several important matters are to be considered.* * * * *
TANKERS TOP 
WOOSTER TO 
END SEASON
Captain Reckling Stars As 
Plaids Splash to 
43-32 Win
The Varsity tankmen cffcctcd a 
happy ending to the history of "the 
1931 swimming campaign by defeat
ing a strong W6o$tcr ohtft with 
a 43-32 score last week. The meet 
was staged in the Ohio town where 
the populus turned out and created 
more interest per square inch than 
that which is found at a tea danc6. 
The Plaid naviagtdrs w,cre equal to 
the reception and gave a fine ex
hibition of swimming and 'how it 
should-be don.e for maximum speed.
Captain A1 Redding, the only 
senior on the team,, bid a fair fare
well to the collegiate swimming 
lanes by taking his usual first places 
in the 50 and 100-yard dashes in 
addition to performing well in the 
clean-up position on the winning 
relay. Al has been a big asset to 
the tank teams of the past three 
years, and his place next year will 
be a hard one to fill.
The timely efforts of Bill Ed
wards were accounted for in the 
200-yard swim. Bill  traversed , the 
distance in great style, leading tlie 
way across the finish line. His 
help in the free style relay was 
also of no mean consequence. Cad 
mus scored a well needed first 
place in the back stroke, and was 
followed by Hazelwood,
Ted Estabrooke, Skibo-s fanciful 
diver, shared in the scoring with 
second places in the diving and 
2d0ryard swim. Franlce splashed 
through with a ifccOnd in the breast 
stroke, and also started the relay 
off on a winning pace.
The meet was /held in a crowd
ed room that gave a slight resem
blance of a monkey cage, it being 
necessary for latc-comers to hang 
on to windows, _pipcs, and miscel
laneous objects. After Al Redding 
made ilie first unexpected splash 
into the water it was common prac
tice for any crowded spectator to 
find additional room in the watery 
tank. In accordance with the post
season custom, the return trip was 
made in a cloud of smoke. Estabrookc,. with his moth-eaten pipe, 
was concecded the puffing .honors,

PRESIDENT BOXERS FRATERNITY-DORMITORY 
DEFEAT PLAIDS, 5-2 BASKETBALL STANDING
Burke and Atlas of Yearling 
Team Only Carnegians 
to Win Bouts
Carnegies boxers went down to 
their fourth successive defeat of 
the season Saturday night, claim
ing but two of the seven bouts 
between the Tartans and the W. 
and J., pugilists.
Although the Tartan squad 
Was handicapped by the absence of 
several of the regulars, the Proxies 
had the situation well in hand all 
the way, walking off: with a 5-2 
count. The bouts *werc held in 
the Carnegie gym before a crowd 
of well over a thousand.
The disappointment of the home 
fans was partially offset, however, 
by Jeff Burkes brilliant victory 
over Kistlcr, President football 
star, in the 165 pound class, Burke 
cooly fought off his opponents 
rushes and gave out terrific pun
ishment in the infighting, at which 
he scented to have a big advantage. 
All three rounds were jammed
full of action, making by far the 
best bout of the evening.
The evening's finale also proved 
to be a thriller, Alex Ducanis los
ing' a doubtful decision to Dcmctowicz, a big Russian boy who was 
built along husky lines. Duke was 
easily the classier boxer, making
his man miss frequently and at 
times look foolish but the Wash
ington boy had a right punch like 
a pile driver. In the third  stanza 
Dukes left began to tell, and most 
of the fails thought he had Avon.
Another bout that was well ac
cepted by the Crowd jc the ban
tamweight scrap between' (Kansas' 
Wertz, Carnegie freshman, and
"Sparky, Adams, popular Pitts
burgh - boy who was fighting for 
W. arid J. The fighting was fast 
and close all the way, but Adams 
was awarded the judges decision.
, Carnegies first .victory came 
the 125 pound class whcri Atlas, 
subing for Eddie Ashe, outsluggcd 
and outpushed Jennings of the 
Washington,' Pa., school. Atlas is 
one of those fighters who gives a 
full minutes warning before taking 
a swing, but when one of his 
roundhouscrs connccts, the thud 
can be heard to echo and re-echo.
The home teams chances of 
taking the meet were lost when its 
best bet, Mr. Mike Restainethey 
all sdem to be "Misters' in this 
racketopened up an old cut 
around one eye and the referee
stopped the bout in the second 
round. Mike looked like a sure 
winner at tlief time.
Kummcr, Tartan welterweight, 
apparently lost control of his feet, 
which were continually slipping 
from under him at very inoppor
tune times. His opponent, Gard
ner, a husky boy with a sock in 
both hands, scored a technical 
kayo in the third round.
In the 155 'pound division, OsW. and J. o n t c las s c d Bert
aions thus far indicate that the an
nual affair will possess its usual 
amount of interest and excitement, 
Contestants arc reminded that
swimming suits will be very much 
in order for the afternoon.

SMOKING TOBACCO
T
HE men who go to the univer

know tobacco . . . they see how it 
grows and what makes it good.
So when Virginia students, and 
the men who stroll down old South 
Limestone Street in Lexington, 
pack their pipes with Edgeworth, 
their choice tells volumes about the 
cool, slow-burning quality of this 
favorite smoking tobacco.
Its the same story everywhere 
North, South, East and West. In 
42 out of 54 leading colleges and 
universities, college men prefer the 
smooth, fragrant burley blend of 
Edgeworth. Try Edgeworth your

would like is some swdet gentle

I registered in Arts, because only 
art students can go, which is a

chines parked on tlie Park lawn 
around the curve of the road by 
the lower end of Industries. I 
think I saw. where there was a no
tice to this effect in the Plaid a 
few weeks ago. Well, I guess all 
there is to it will be some dras
tic move by Pittsburghs Own" 
in the near, future. If the offend
ing car owners persist in trespass
ing, as they have been doing, it 
will not be a surprise to me to 
notice some night students weeping 
and wailing about their stolen gas 
buggies. Investigation will disclose 
that the city has some vesy nice 
tow-trucks which they put into 
V.rvice and hauled .the wrongly 
parked gas chariots to the lockup. 
Now this is exactly as anyone 
with a sense of reason could ex
pect, so, if you wish to avoid any 
trouble, and you are one of those 
individuals wlio are. doing the deed, 
better mend your ways, because 
you have been warned in the Plaid, 
and that's that.I see where our neighboring edu
cational institution just concluded 
a contest with the idea of securing 
a king and queen for the campus. 
Well, a contest like that for the 
. night students would surely be a 
great idea, and I am going to talk 
it up, because I am sure I would 
win at least one of the positions 
and I am certain that I would be 
placed after judgment by the art 
critics. You know you can never 
tell what these- things will lead 
to, and there is nothing like a little 
competition. Who knows, I may 
become famous over night. And 
that in itself should be an incen
tive for a date for the Arts Ball. 
There I go again talking the Arts 
Ball. Well, if you were as en
thusiastic as I am about it, and 
you should be, I am sure you 
would not delay another second, 
but would make your first deposit 
for the ticket right now.
On Saturday evening, March 21, 
the Night College of Engineering 
will hold the last social event of 
the 3rear for this college. . Prepara
tions have been under way for 
some time and plans arc made to 
have a very fine program.
The "Carnegie Tech Glee Club 
quartet has been secured to render 
selections as only this group can. 
They have been on the air several 
times this year and you jLre as
sured of a big treat when you 
listen to them. . Listed - in the 
program are other acts which. will 
come as surprises. However, we 
do know that there will be some 
student talent which Will be unique 
and should not be missed by any 
night engineer.
Smokes will be available to 
everybody, and a lunch will also 
be served at the conclusion of the 
affair. The smoker will be .held in 
the Union on the third floor of 
Administration Hall, and the pro
gram wili commence at 8:30 p. m.
Night engineering students Who 
wish to work for this affair are re
quested to be on hand at 6:30 p. 
m., - on Saturday, March 21, at the 
Union , in order to make the nec
essary preparations.

WORTH THE RISK
The Arts Ball Poster Contest 
just held in the Night College of 
Fine Arts brought out some very 
finely executed work by the night 
students and showed the interest 
Which existed among the night 
group. The posters submitted 
compared Very favorably with any 
that had previously been turned 
in.
The first prize, a free ticket to 
the Arts Ball, was awarded to 
Robert Boston for his poster of 
a couplc dancing. S. Wyllifcyston 
carried away second and third 
prizes With two well presented 
clown cartoons giving slogans for 
the Arts Ball. The two students 
certainly showed marked ability in 
their^ originality of design.
Interest in the coming event is 
growing steadily as evidenced by 
the sale of tickets. You can hardly 
go anywhere in the building with
out hearing something about the 
affair. The Arts Ball is the topic, 
and the next question is the date, 
but. this should not worry any 
night student because there is a 
committee ready to. fix this ques
tion for you; just make your wants 
known ahd you will be supplied 
with a charming partner.
, April 10 is going to be a red 
letter day in the Arts College, and 
the night students arc certainly 
coming across with their orders 
for tickets which indicates that a 
big representation will be on hand.
Several students, connected with 
a local institution, recently under
went a series of tests in the atmos
pheric room of the Society of Heat
ing and Ventilating Engineers, lo
cated in the Bureau of Mines. The 
tests were part of a study which 
the society has beCn conducting 
for several years, intended to show 
the effects of heat on workers in 
various industries.
While it is admittable that a 
good deal of general knowledge 
(Specialized/ perhaps) can be ob
tained, it seems hardly possible 
that the tests made under such 
ideal conditions would have much 
practical value.
In the first place, the average 
industrial worker does not have 
the sensitive physical and .mental 
makeup of an average student, 
however "tough the student may 
regard himself.
Again,- it *is one thing to sit in 
a comparatively quiet chamber with 
nothing in particular to do, and 
quite another thing to operate or 
watch the operation of the variou? 
machines in any industry. The 
mental and physical strains induces 
by industrial work cannot be exact
ly duplicated by synthetic tests.
In this regard, it seems reason
able to inquire if it is wise, not 
only for these men, but for all 
those wholehearted people working 
for the advancement of any par
ticular science, to risk their health, 
and possibly their lives, in what 
often seems to be superfluous tests.
Experiment has doi^c a great 
deal towards making the world 
the more or less comfortable place 
it is. It would be highly unthink
able to: discount the advantages of 
carefully conducted arid intelligent
ly observed experimentation. How
ever, with almost everyone ex
perimenting with something or 
other (a keeping up with the 
Joneses attitude) it would be ad
visable to keep the investigations 
within a safe, close margin, and 
more definite good will result from 
the few facts discovered than from 
the mass -of unrelated data now 
being collected. ' McG.
SIX NEW MAGAZINES
(Continued from Page One) 
the present time the speaker has not 
been announced, but Mr. Davis 
promises that he will be one who is 
popular with the students. A male 
quartet from the Music Depart
ment will sing, with Mr. Matthew 
Frew as organist.
GYM TO BE USED FOR 
NIGHT INDUSTRIES 
SMOKER MARCH 28
The second semester smoker of the 
Night College of Industries will be 
held Saturday evening, March 2S, in 
the gymnasium. This affair, a tradi
tion of that college, is the final 
smoker of the year. All industries 
students arc eligible to attend;
The program has not been com
pleted but the officers and committccmcn report that entertainment will 
not be lacking. From past experi
ences (we have attended for several 
years) the student body of Industries 
can rest assured that there wiH also 
be plenty to cat and smoke; for what 
Would a smoker be like without these 
two most necessary items of pleasure.
More information should be avail
able for next issue, but at present all 
we can suggest is that you mark the 
date and plan to be there. Saturday 
evening, March 28, 7:30 p. m. to 11:00 
p. m. Admission free, but you MUST 
show your registration card and have 
a ticket which will be distributed 
through the corridors of Industries 
between now and the 26th. G.
FIND ANGELS FIGURES 
BURIED IN GRIME
INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS
From the figures obtained during 
a survey of working conditions in 
eight of the Eastern and Southern 
statcs^thc United States Womens 
Bureau has found that a larger per
centage of the women injured in 
industrial accidents arc in the 
younger classes, b6twecn seventeen 
and twenty. This seems to be an 
unusual finding in moSt cases, for 
labor statistics show that in most 
of the districts studied, sometimds 
less than twenty percent of the 
women employed Wef'e under tho 
age qf twenty.
The survey also revealed that, 
while fewer girls were injured than 
boys, the proportion among the 
younger classes was larger for 
women. This can hardly be ex
plained by any iron bound state
ment, for there is no reason to be
lieve that girls arc more careless 
in their work than men.
One of the most interesting finds 
of the study . was the fact that 
most of the accidents caused by
machinery were inflicted on the 
younger groups, both merj. and 
women, while those mishaps due 
to falls and similar normal slips 
were usually participated in by tlie 
older men and women.
The survey will probably result in
the narrowing down of the fidld that
is constantly being gone over by
safety experts in an attempt to 
prevent the occurence of any acci
dents which arc in any way pre
ventable. -

From London comes the report 
that when workmen were scrambling 
over tlie sides and top of West
minster Abby, giving this famous edi
fice its first scrubbing in ccnturlcs, 
two marble figures of angels were 
uncovered which were apparently 
carved during the Thirteenth century. 
The figures were exquisitely enameled 
in colors, but were hidden under a 
covering of grime and dirt onfi inch 
thick.
Covered with the dut of centuries 
I' Wonder what unknown treasurers 
of art arc hidden itf the SaiUe way 
in other places. Treasures which are 
priceless, dating back to theera 
when Greek and Roman art was at 
its height, no doubt lay hidden in 
the ruins of some long lost and fprgotten city. ArcheolbgiSts in their 
search for inklings of past civilization 
have brought to'light many fine ex
amples of early art. These discover
ies are of great value, not only be
cause of their antiquity, but bccause 
they give us a better insight into 
the past, thus enabling us to recon
struct the .civilization of prehistoric 
times.
In the centuries to come, it is not 
a far fctchcd thought, to wonder 
how mticli of our present civilization 
and inode of living Will live oil, or 
how much will be lost, temporarily, 
only to be rediscovered, at some 
future time and thus make "finds* 
for the then archcologists. <
LOST
During the past week a set oE keys 
in a black leather ease was lost on 
the campus. It would be appreciated 
if the finder of these keys would 
bring them to the lost and found 
department lotated in the Lockcr 
Key Room, Basement of Administra
tion Hall.
The Plaid has published several 
notices relative to articles which 
have been lost or found on the 
campus by Students, An effort is 
made to have the rightful owners 
located by the school, and the co
operation of the Students is solicited 
in order that this service may func
tion to the fullest. ^ You arc therefore 
requested to bring, articles which 
have been found to the department 
and also to report any articles lost. 
The department has several articles 
awaiting identification so it might 
be a good idea for those who have 
lost property to inquire at the Key 
Room. Perhaps they may be able to 
reclaim their lost articles.

What the NEW
HUMIDOR PACK
means to Camel Smokers *
C
OMPARE a package of Camels with 
any other cigarette and note the 
difference in the technique of packing.
Note that Camels are completely en
closed in an outer transparent cover of 
moisture-proof cellophane and sealed 
air-tight at every point.
We call this outer shell the Humidor 
Pack. It differs from the ordinary cello
phane pack and while it is egg-shell 
thin, it means a lot in terms of cigarette 
enjoyment.
It means, for instance, that evapora. 
tion is checkmated and that Salt 
Lake City can 
now have as good 
Camels asWinstonSalem.
While Camels are 
made of a blend of 
the choicest Turk
ish and mellowest 
domestic tobaccos, 
it is highly impor
tant, if you are to

The Pittsburgh Tenting Laboratory chart above 
graphically shows you that only tho Camel Humidor 
Pack delivers cigarettes to you in prime condition
The Humidor Pack insures that. It 
prevents the fine tobaccos of Camels 
from drying out and losing any of their 
delightful flavor.
Aside from cheap tobacco, two fac
tors in a cigarette can mar the smokers 
pleasure:
Fine particles of peppery dust if left 
in the tobacco by inefficient cleaning 
methods sting and irritate delicate 
throat membrane.
Dry tobacco, robbed of its natural 
moisture by scorching or by evapora
tion gives off a hot smoke that burns 
the throat with 
every inhalation.
We take every 
precaution against 
these factors here 
at Winston- Salem.
A special vacuum 
cleaning apparatus 
removes dust and 
now the new Humi
dor Pack prevents 
dryness.
this quality, that these cigarettes come 
to you with their natural moisture 
content still intact.
Cheek the difference //ourself
It is a very simple matter to check the 
difference between Humidor Pucked
Camels and other ordinary dry cigarettes.
First of all you can feel the difference 
as you roll the cigarettes between your 
fingers. Camels are full-bodied and 
pliable. A dry cigarette crumbles under 
pressure and sheds tobacco.
If you will hold a cigarette to each ear 
and roll them with your fingers you can 
actually hear the difference.
The real test of course is to smoke them. 
And heres where the new Humidor Pack 
proves a real blessing to the smoker.
As you inhale the cool, fragrant smoke 
from a Camel you get all the mildness 
and magic of the fine tobaccos of which 
it is blended.
But when you draw in the hot smoke 
from a dried cigarette see how flat and 
brackish it is by comparison and how 
harsh it is to your throat.
If you are a regular Camel smoker 
you have already noticed what proper 
condition of the cigarette means.
But if you havent tried Camels in 
the new Humidor Pack you have a new 
adventure with Lady Nicotine in store.
Switch your affections for just one 
day, then go back to your old love 
tomorrow if you can.

Student Admissions
Before the recent combined production of the Music and Drama Departments was presented, it was announced that, 
owing to faculty demands and requests by friends of the Drama 
Department, no tickets would be available to students for the evening performances. A student matinee was, however, sched
uled for Friday afternoon. The Drama Department was certainly thoughtful to provide a student matinee, but they^ evidently 
failed to realize that, owing to late classes, only a limited number of students would be bie to eje the production. The 
students are usually free from scholastic-tasks on-Friday and Saturday evenings and it seems only fdii* that they should have been admitted on those nights. The production ran Thursday 
night and last night and certainly that was ample opportunity 
for faculty members to witness it. As for outsiders, it is entirely inconceivable that they should be given preference over the student body. The students make the school and, while 
they would probably come on foot and not in Packards, nevertheless, their sense of appreciation and enjoymiit is just as keen 
as that of the blue-bloods of Pittsburgh.The Athletic Association, also," has taken dvantage of the students on several occasions.  During football games they are 
placed on the 20 or 30-yard line while the general public is admitted to the choice seats in the center sections. At the re
cent home basketball game with Pitt, the students were shunted to the end sections or made to stand, while the cash customers 
ivere given the best seating accommodations.We arc not opposed to commercialized projects to a certain 
degree, but when the student is neglected to the edification of outsiders, it is time to call a halt. The Drama Department and

Resolution VI, as recently adopted at the Mid-West 
Student Conference held at Carnegie, presents a problem of timely. interest to the. entire undergraduate body. This ex
pression of student opinin reads as follows"Resolved that this conference shall go on record as being in favor of a student 
assessment paid with the registration fee, to go to the support 
of student publications, and to permit distribution of copies of such publications. <
Applying this statement directly to Carnegie would mean 
that through a fixed assessment paid with the activities fee the entire student body would receive free copies of the Thistle, Puppet and Student Directory. The Tartan is already being 
handled under such "a plan-and the degree of success achieved in this case could be appreciated if an attempt were made to restore it to a basis of charging for each copy.
Here at Carnegie the adoption of the plan would mean 
several desirable changes could be made. At present the Thistle is in a precarious financial condition due to the fact that the 
average sales in recent years has only been' about six .hundred copies in a school with an enrollment four times that number. Perhaps the five dollars now charged for this publication limits 
the distribution more than anything else. The immediate effect of a plan resulting in every student receiving a copy of the Thi'stle would be to permit publication of a year book of even increased quality at half the present price.
The Puppet, now fairly stable financially could offer copies at a price greatly under the present rating. The Student Directory, an increasing necessity among the undergraduates, could and should be given to every student under this combined plan 
with the major publications. The rediiced price per copy will not be the only financial change made as increased advertising 
with the greater circulation would make conditions easier for the various staffs.
A general view of the situation is this; for an .addition of perhaps five dollars to the activities fee everyone will be entitled to a Thistle, a Student Directory, and each issue of the 
Tartan and Puppet.  The annoyance caused by student salesmen will be greatlj'- diminished and these men freed for. more 
necessary work bettering their own product. Interest in school affairs as presented in the publications will become more prevalent with greater numbers reading each issue.

DR. ROSS CONTINUES 
DISCUSSIONS
(Continued from Page One) 
have so far outrun supply that a 
stable- high price would be auto
matically set without the artificial 
support of stabilization.
Within' two years rubber rose to 
83 cents a pound and then fell 
with a thud. Today instead of rub
ber selling at 21 cents which the 
British considered low, it is quoted 
at nine cents per pound. Obvi
ously something went wrong.
In this - example of stabilization, 
the prices that came as the first 
result of restriction stimulated pro
duction in the Dutch colonics. This 
more than offset the restriction, of 
production in the British colonies, 
and resulted in a free ride for the 
Dutch at British expense.
This failure naturally brings the 
question: Arc stabilization schemes 
such as: we have seen in the last 
ten years in rubber, coffee, .copper, 
and wheat ' ' economically sound? 
Judging-from the experience of the 
past, the answer is no. The chances 
are at least, ten to  one against 
success: . Coffee and copper stabi
lisation furnish two, more' examples 
of failure.
'Coffee Problems Encountered
For: years a condition of oversupply 'existed. in Brazilian coffee 
and here, as in the case of- our 
own wheat crop,. the government 
made an effort to solve the prob
lem by stabilization. Beginning 
with 1921 tliej Brazilian Government 
working through the Coffee In
stitute: which corresponds to our 
Farm. Board lifted millions , of sacks 
of; coftee from the market.
By ; 1930 . this accumulated stock 
of coffee withheld from the market 
by the.". Coffee Institute was suffi
cient.'to ;;fill jll the coffee cups of 
flie world for a year without the 
production of another bean. At 
this, juncture, the government found 
Itself unable to borrow the money 
necessary to carry the 1930' sur
plus crop. The Coffee Institute 
had to unload. Coffee prices, Bra
zilian bonds,, and even the Bra
zilian'Government itself went down 
in one of the worst debacles of 
the decade.
