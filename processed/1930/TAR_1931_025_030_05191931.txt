ELECTIONS DISCUSSED
Committee Suggests New 
Regulations For 
Plebes
Student Council at its meeting 
on Tuesday, May 1, approved the 
list of resolutions for next years 
counpil which was presented by 
Frank Mueller, chairman of the 
.resolutions committee.
The list includes a recommenda
tion that the 1933 junior class of 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege be assessed separately for each 
Womens Junior Prom, that is, each 
member of the class will pay the 
tax for the Prom of the current 
year. This recommendation would 
eliminate the necessity of paying 
for two dances at one time. Th 
change is possible due to the fact 
that the class of 1931 is leaving a 
surplus of $500 which may be used 
to pay for the tickets of the mem
bers of the class of 1932 '"ho have 
aiready paid for next years Wom
ens Prom. The approval of this 
recommendation by next years 
council would put the Pror on a 
sounder, financial basis and would 
ei.courage many to ' attend who 
otherwise would not, owing to the 
uncertainty of their attendance the 
following year.
The committee also suggested 
that the Plebe Regulations be strict
ly enforced until Thanksgiving and 
then be withdrawn for the remain
der of the year. In the past it has 
been found that the main objectives 
of Plebe Regulations, teaching the 
plc.be respect, relieving him of his 
cockiness acquired- as a senior in 
high school, and making him feci 
a part of the school, may be ac
complished in this period. It is 
also recommended that the regula
tion forbidding freshmen to speak 
to members bf the opposite sex be 
abolished in the future.
With regard to elections, the fol
lowing recommendations were pre
sented by the committee: that' the 
treasurer of the juni.r class in each 
school be the treasurer of the 
senate in that school, that the sub
seniors in the Arts School have 
the same powers of voting as have 
all other fourth year students, that 
the students in the fifth year at 
Carnegie regardless of the course 
in which they arc enrolled shall' not 
be eligible" to participate in any 
non-athlctic activity o'her than the 
organization of the fifth year class, 
and that the vice president of the 
scnoir class in Arts School be the 
vice president of the senate.
It was also recommended that an 
attempt be made to revive interest 
in monthly student assemblies as a 
means o^ fostering school spirit by

Greek Letter Fraternities Exceed
Other Men In Scholarship Average
"Fraternity men, for the first 
time in history, exceeded the all 
mens average in scholarship, ac
cording to the report made by the 
scholarship committee chairman at 
the twenty-second annual Interfraternity Conference held at the 
Pennsylvania Hotel in New York 
City. This announcement, the high 
spot of the convention, has re
ceived much attention in .educa
tional circles throughout the United 
States.
Of importance to advocates of 
fraternities is the fact that nqt 
only did the scholastic average of 
fraternity men surpass that of nonfraternity men, but that it is now 
even better than the all mens 
average. The Interfratcrnity Con
ference reports that "records of 
,200,000 students in 125 colleges and 
universities show the scholarship 
of fraternity men to average 1 
per ccnt better than the average of 
all undergraduates and 2 per ccnt 
better than for non-fraternity 
men.
This announcement has been fol
lowed by much flattering publicity.
The New York Sun, in a recent 
editorial said, "The Greek letter 
fraternity has often been under cri
ticism; not only has it managed to 
survive, but it has succeeded in 
growing stronger with the years. 
That it can be made an instrument 
for cultural and intellectual de
velopment as well as for social ad
vancement only its bitterest foes 
will deny.
Acting in an advisory way the 
Interfratcrnity Conference has suc
ceeded in "co-ordinating the efforts 
of various national fraternities to 
improve the standing in scholar
ship of their members. The edi
torial writer of the Sun further 
points out that Wherever a local 
chapter is as eager for its mem
bers to win Phi Beta Kappa keys 
as to get varsity letters in sports, 
its average of scholarship is likely 
to be high. Intensive and intel
ligent efforts to stimulate, eager
ness of that kind have been sys
tematically supported by some of 
the national organizations. This 
commendable work, it is evident, 
now is beginning to bear fruit.

IMPROVEMENTS ON 
CAMPUS TO EXTEND 
THROUGH SUMMER
Program Includes New 
Organic Chemistry 
Laboratory
Many physical improvements 
about the campus are being under
taken by the department of Build 
ings and Grounds, and if all arc 
accomplished the beauty of the 
campus arid utility of the buildings 
will be greatly enhanced.
Included in this improvement 
program, which began early in the

He pointed out that the telephone 
industry was one of the few cases 
where research work began imme
diately on the birth of the industry. 
Today the telephone laboratories 
employ 5,900 engineers and research 
workers of all kinds.
Among the many interesting 
laboratory researches described by 
Mr. Slocurh was the testing of 
materials, for telephone, He - told 
how many machines have been de
vised to twist telephone cords and 
then stretch them; this is repeated 
until the cords fail. Other ma
chines lift receivers and slam them 
back on the hook in order to imi
tate the hard usage they receive
when wrong numbers arc obtained.
Mr. Slocum also told of some of 
the "by-products of the telephone 
laboratories. These include the 
orthophonie vietrola, the clcctric 
stethoscope, the artificial larynx, 
and many other devices. At the 
conclusion of his talk Mr, Slocum 
showed some films to demonstrate 
the operation of the automatic tele
phone.
E. G. Stone, vice president of
the A. I. E. E.; spoke on the aims 
and purposes of that organization. 
He said that electrical engineers 
should consider the A. I. E. E.

THE VARSITY TRACK MEN slipped out of the short

supported with a collection of competent performers in certain 
field events.The outstanding star was Tom Coulter, classy sophomore 
flash from across the northern border. Tom took only four 
first places mainly, because he was just entered in four events. His ability is magnified by the fact that two of the races re
sulted in new track records, and a tie with another. Fifty seconds is the new record for the 440 in the Plaid Bowl. How
ever, George Neases time of 49.8 seconds still holds for the 
school record made elsewhere. . Coulter equaled the school record in the 120 high hurdles, but reduced the time in the low sticks to 13.0 seconds. A final trial in the broad jump gave

Tartans Drop First Track Meet Of Year To Geneva
The Covenanters of Geneva Col
lege journeyed from Beaver - Falls 
down to Pittsburgh Saturday aft
ernoon and administered to the 
fast moving Carnegie track team 
its first defeat of the year. The 
meet was held in the Tartan. Bowl, 
and the .score -was 81-54. Geneva's 
superiority in the track events 
gave the visitors their margin of 
victory. Geneva won all the first 
places in the track events with the 
exception of the Quarter Mile. 
Carnegie showed its strength in 
field events, but even though the 
Tartans ran up quite a few points 
here they were unable to over
come the lead gained by their op
ponents on the track.
. Tom Coulter, star Sophomore 
performer for Carnegie, -was by far 
the outstanding man of the meet'. 
Tom alone scored 20 points for 
the Plaid, winning four first places, 
a feat which probably has never 
been equaled in the history of 
Carnegip. Toms four first places 
were no meager' performances^ He 
broke one school record, tied one, 
and broke a track mark. In his 
first event of the afternoon he 
equaled Jimmy Robertsons high 
hurdle mark of 15.4 seconds. In the 
quarter, Tom fought his# way to 
the front and won in the remark
able time of 50 seconds flat. Then 
in the low hurdles, Coulter was 
forced all the way by a dusky op
ponent, but Tom showed enough 
reserve to win. The time was 13 
seconds, a new Tech mark. After 
theV low hurdles lie entered the 
broad jump, and on his last leap 
made almost 21 feet, thereby win
ning first place.
In the 100 and 220 yard dashes 
Geneva scored both first and sec
ond places. George Nease was 
third in each race. The time of 
the 100-yard dash was 10.2, wlticli 
was- won by Sauer., Thomas won 
the 220 in 22.61 seconds. Geneva 
took a first and second in the half 
mile, Frank of Carnegie finishing 
third, Wilson of Geneva took the 
mile; lie was closely followed by 
Ramsey of Carnegie;. Jess 'Price 
failed to place: in the two mile, all 
three places going to Geneva.
The shot put proved to be the 
Tartan's biggest -point gainer of 
the meet, all nine points going to 
the Plaid entries. This event was 
won by Scyboth, who was closely 
followed by, Karcis and Blaine. In 
the hammer and the ^discus, the 
Plaid field men scored first and 
second places. Armentrout won 
the hammer and Murray was sec
ond, while in ttyc discus,- Karcis 
again took first place, and Blaine 
second.
This week our track team closes 
the season with two tough meets. 
Today they meet Pitt over at the 
Stadium, arid, by the way, this 
should be a fine contcst to wits. Friday night the team goes 
to Grove City for the final meet
f the selison.

Bout Tomorrow
Night
Something rather informal in the 
way of a wrestling bout will get 
under way on Wednesday night at 
8 oclock in the gym. The entry list 
includes students from all parts of 
the college, many of whom partici
pate in other branches of sport. The 
purpose of these matches is. to de
termine whether the atmosphere 
about Carnegie would support a Plaid 
wrestling for next year. Interest has 
not been lacking among the con
testants, and it is very probable that 
the bout tomorrow night will draw 
a large crowd, admission being free 
to everyone.
There will be eight or ten matches 
in the different weight classes. The 
entries in the middle-weight di
visions arc so plentiful that it will 
be ncccssary to hold elimination 
matches, and follow up with the 
finals to determine the winner. It is 
probable that the final victors of 
each weight class will be presented 
with the numerals of their gradua
tion year.
The inter-collegiate rules call for 
a ten minute match which can be 
ended sooner by one wrestler effect
ing a fall. A. fall is earned when 
one wrestler holds the two shoulders 
of his opponent on the. mat for two 
seconds. If there is no fall the win
ner is determined by the points 
gained in. the time advantages.

The Plcbc track men resumed 
their winning habits last week by 
adding two more teams to their 
string of victories. Last Tuesday 
they again defeated Peabody High 
School with a score1 of 70 to 46. 
The school boys were much 
stronger than they were at the 
first of the year, liaA'irig developed 
such stars as Mornian in the 
hurdles.
The Plebes, as usual, weie ter
ribly weak in the sprints, They 
earned but six out of the 27 dash 
points, five of which came as a 
result of Carrs . winning the 440. 
Allen took first  in the mile, and 
Edelblut broke the tape in -the
hurdles. Biggin earned his usual 
first in the high jump, while Fprsman scored heavily in the weight 
events. The strong javelin trio of 
Ford, Hiltz, at)d Heinzer effected 
a clean sweep in their event.
Friday an over-confident Plcbc 
team almost went down to defeat, 
finally winning by the close score 
of ,63 to 59. The surprisingly 
strong opposition was furnished by 
Shady Side Academy, vcr^ often a 
weak team.
Shann, with his broad jump of 
19 feet 4 inches, was the Frank 
Mcrriwcll of the day. His last 
leap in the last event enabled him 
to gain the much needed second 
place, thus placing the Plebes 
ahead.
The Skibo yearlings continued 
thfcir failings in the 100 and 220 
dashes, but camc back strong in 
the 8S0 and the mile. Allen won 
the mile and placcd second in the 
8SO. Schcll had little trouble win
ing this latter event, Both hurdle 
races were won by Graham of 
Shady Side, a very promising prep 
school runner.
Biggin again took the high jump

Rain featured last weeks schedule 
for the varsity, coupled with a 
crushing defeat at the hands of 
Georgetown in Washington, D. C. 
Pitt was scheduled to meet the Tar
tans on Monday, but J. Pluvius was 
in no mood to allow such an engage
ment, and the meet was cancelled. 
On Thursday the team started on its 
aiiriup!' eastern invasion and was 
rained out at Buckncll and Temple 
on consecutive days. Saturday, how
ever, dawned fair enough, and the 
Georgetown meet went off as plan
ned. After taking a 7 to 0 trouncing 
there, it seems as though the boys 
got little more than a nice ride out 
of the trip.
Losing to Georgetown is no dis
grace, for they arc considered one 
of the strongest teams in the coun
try. The only match that they have 
lost this year was one to Pitt earlier 
in the season. The Georgetown de
feat was the first that Carnegie team 
has suffered this season.
Monday Pitts strong outfit will 
visit the campus for a meet, and 
Wednesday the team will journey to 
Washington, Pa., for a! return meet 
with W. & J. Friday the season 
will be officially closed, with Bethany 
furnishing the opposition.
This year Coach Hoover liais en
countered many difficulties in getting 
a .strong team together. The chi,cf 
trouble was finding time to prac
tice; rain cut into the playing days 
so much that the. team did not have 
time to get thorough^ into condi
tion. To offset this, the material 
was excellent,, there being seven or 
eight players between whom there 
was little to choose.
McCloskcy will be the only letter 
man graduating this year. Captain 
Morris, who did not play in his 
sophomore year, is enrolled in a 
five year course and will be available 
again next year. This years array 
of sophomore starsGroves, Bcrghane, Dueger, Ferguswill ;ill be 
back and several nctmcn' from the 
present freshman squad will extend 
the regulars if they wish* to keep 
their berths.

ALL RETURNS FOR DANCE 
TICKETS MUST BE MADE 
PROMPTLY
Inter-Night 
College Dance
The Night Student Council has 
just concluded its last social func
tion for the night college year of 
1930-31 with the traditional InterNight College Dance. The dancc is 
the grand finale of the night college 
year and is the time when all the 
night students gather for a general 
celebration of the closing of the regu
lar night term.
All the privious efforts of the 
Council to give a successful function 
have been dimmed by the glowing 
success of the affair which was held 
on May 9 last. The whole program 
was an outstanding success. Every
thing was elaborated upon and those 
who attended the party arc loud 
in praise for the wonderful time.
The Committee headed by Social 
Chairman Henry E. Mauro certainly 
had its hands full to make the dancc 
ready for the final windup of the 
Campus Carnival as there was a 
cabaret dance in. progress during the 
afternoon, and work to prepare the 
Gymnasium for the night dancc 
could not be started until after the 
end of the dancc. It was surprising 
the amount of work accomplished 
by the committee. The lighting em
ployed was unique and produced a 
very wonderful effect.
Art Giles orchestra furnished the 
music, and nothing more could be 
desired from this group of musicians. 
We hope that we will hca- more i 
from them.
The whole affair was just like ~ 
dream. One of those wonderful so
cial functions one reads about but 
rarely is fortunate enough to enjoy. 
The evening was just right for such 
a gathering and during the intermis
sion, several parties took, occasion 
to enjoy a stroll along the plaza at 
the upper entrance of the auditorium.
Amid the dimmed colored lights 
playing upon the crystal ball, the 
dancc continued until the end, and 
climaxed a social 3'car that will go 
down in history as being an out
standing one.
YOUR GRADES
Just about this time a large num
ber of night students arc wonder
ing how they made out in their final 
examinations. Some, 110 doubt know 
their success or failure, tut the great 
majority do not. As the time goes on 
and nothing is heard about the 
grades, students arc prone to call 
up their instructors or department 
heads. This is not a very desirable 
practice* and only very limited in
formation is securcd.
When we take into consideration 
the enormous number of grades to 
be approved and entered 011 the stu
dent's records at the Registrars office 
it is surprising that wc receive the 
information so soon after the finals.
A large number of night students 
have enrolled for the supplementary 
terms, and this registration has to 
be taken care of in addition to the 
regular routine of the office. Then 
there is the question of tlie day 
school with almost one month to 
go. Just about this time everything 
about the campus focuses upon the 
grand windup of the school year.
Taking all these things into con
sidration, it would seem that a 
fair and sane course to follow, and 
one which would be fair to all con
cerned, would be to wait until the 
graded arc mailed out. In this way 
nobody would be imposed upon, and 
the office in charge of the school 
records would not be handicapped in 
compiling the data.

New Tartan Staff
The Plaid wishes to take this oc
casion to fclicit the newly appointed 
Tartan Staff for the coming year, 
and wish for them succcss in their 
undertaking. Any assistance which 
can be rendered by the, Plaid will be 
cheerfully given.
The relationship which has existed 
between the two staffs has been ideal 
and successful in every way. Each 
year has seen a continued spirit of 
service and co-operation manifested 
and in appreciated the Plaid extends 
to the retiring Tartan Staff of 1930- 
31 heartfelt thanks for the splendid 
manner in which this staff has car
ried 011. They have completed a suc
cessful year in college journalism, 
and have left a goal for the new 
staff to aspire to. Adieu retiring 
members of 1930-31 staff.
FLYING FEET
The recent ilight of a large body 
of planes over Pittsburgh inspired 
many of the inhabitants of  the city 
with such various and conflicting 
thoughts that it was quite amusing 
to be in a location where one could 
hear the various audible observations.
During the day, aside from the 
rush hours, the Forbes street cars 
present an attractively assorted cross 
section of the city, more so perhaps, 
than any other of the various lines. 
Enscounccd 011 a precarious perch in 
one of these conveyances, many- of 
the excited and inspired "ahs and 
"ahs" of the passengers were noted 
by the writer as the fleet went over.
RETURNS FOR DANCES
Night students who have not made 
returns for the Inter-Night College 
Dancc tickets which was held on 
May 9, should make their returns 
this week. Returns sliould.be sent to 
E. E. McDonald, Treasurer, Night 
Student Council, C. I. T. Schenlcy 
Paark, Pittsburgh, Pa. Several tickets 
are outstanding, and these should be 
cucarcd promptly. Your co-operation 
is expected in order that the ac
count can be closed.

StPQit
Were you, or were 3rou not at the 
Campus Carnival, and the subsequent 
finale of the Night Student Council 
the .Inter-Night College Dancc? No, 
well you dont know what j'ou mis
sed. Yes, then youll agree with me, 
the Idle Student, that it was some
thing, and how. You could hardly 
realize that such things could happen 
at Carnegie. So many dances, and 
functions, it kept you on your toes 
all the time. I am speaking of the 
evenings, because those are the times 
I manager to get around, with tli 
possible exception of the crowning 
of the* Queen . on Thursday. But 
then this formality came off on 
Fridaj', and judging from the crowd, 
Miss Steele was rightly crowned in 
the full prescribed manner and style 
of a queen. I wonder who the king 
is? I think Ill'make a canyass of the 
situation. I have it on my agenda 
for the following fortnight, and if 
I dont find the Brutus, then Im no 
idle night studentfigure that out, 
I cant.
The last issue of the .Tartan had 
several amusing titles on the Plaid 
Page. They read similar to this: Re
flections  Vacation Time  Under
standing Music  Speculation  Para
phrasedMathematics, and What is ,a 
Teacher? You ask me. Well, from 
that array of titles, one would think 
that Reflecting upon Vacation Time 
would give you an Understanding 
of Music, which by the way would 
be Speculation upon a Paraphrased 
subject such as Mathematics, and 
this all leads to What is a Teacher 
in this subject. Well, I dont know, 
except that if you happen to be un
fortunate enough to pass a course 
in Mathematics }rou wont have the 
extreme pleasure of having to con
front a certain individual who will 
^aufh-you- to < scorn at your simplcmindcness in being so adroit (thats 
a five hundred dollar word) as to 
dodge him and his hackneyed expres
sionas a musician,- etc., etc.
You know there is a certain group 
of words used on the campus fre
quently and I dont know hardly how 
to interpret them. They read as fol
lows "Make your reservations at thp 
Y office. Well you sec it is like this, 
I am speaking of a night student 
now. When you go to Y office, 
it is dark, and nobody around, ex
cept in the student council room, 
where you might find some night 
student council worker and he will 
try to fix j'oti up. No doubt the 
signs arc meant for the da}' stu
dents, but it should be remembered 
that the night students arc accustomcd to reading signs in the dark, 
having learned the art from at
tendance at night classes. I  think 
a good idea, yes, I have another idea, 
would be to put the hours, whether 
' a. m. or p. m. or n. p. m. the par
ties will be at the "Y" to receive 
callers on the posters and bulletins, 
so that the night students will not 
be confused. Two recent questions 
were the commcnccmcnt booklets, and 
the Carnegie Tech Excursion to 
Akron. Nobody around to give in
formation or fix you up. And thats 
that.
At all events we are now enter
ing the last lap of the year, and it 
wont be long until the finale will be 
sung and the curtain rung down 011 
all activities for the year. If you 
havent weakened thus far, it is a 
sure sign that you arc a glutton for 
punishment and deserve all you get. 
But then thats what is to be ex
pected when you attend classcs at 
night, and are idle into the bargain.

HENRY E. MAURO, NIGHT 
SOCIAL CHAIRMAN CON
CLUDES SUCCESSFUL YEAR
The Night Student Council had 
just completed a very succcssful so
cial year. Notwithstanding the gen
eral tendency to slow up all around 
011 account of general depression, the 
tireless workers for the council ex
tended themselves more than usual 
to put the affairs over in the pro
verbial Night Student Council style.
The social committee, headed bjr 
Henry E. Mauro, of the Night Col
lege of Fine Arts was always ready 
to give assistance and make the par
ties enjoyable for all those who at
tended. Mr. Mauro was very re
sourceful and many unique innova
tions were employed during the func
tions.
HENRY E. MAURO
Each dance established a record 
which seemed impossible to equal, 
but in every case the record was ex
ceeded and surpassed, both in novel
ties and attendance for the particular 
affair.
In addition to being Social Chair
man, Mr. Mauro is the president of' 
the Night College of Fine Arts, and 
Night Business Manager of The 
Thistle. Mr. Mauro has beenf.a .loyal' 
worker ever since he has been regis
tered in the night college and noth
ing has been too, much for him or 
too small to receive his attention. 
The night student body owes a great 
vote of thanks to Mr. Mauro for his 
efforts to supply them with a little 
social activities to relieve a tedious 
and tiresome term at night school.

Introduction
This issue marks the introduction of a new board of 
editors who will serve to direct the affairs of the Tartan 
for the coming scliool year. The change in personnel also 
marks the start upon the second quarter of a century of 
existence for the Tartan, as the twenty-fifth volume lacks 
but one issue of being completed.The problems met in this span of years undoubtedly 
represent the most severe as regards the existence of a 
newspaper, and the past staffs are to be more than con
gratulated for their excellent service in providing the pres
ent Tartan. The current problem is apparently not one of 
striving for existence but rather one of maintaining present standards and contemplating and executing improvements.Concerning the editorial policy of the new staff no astound
ing changes are contemplated, although there is one special 
desire that whatever the policy be, it is of little importance and practically no avail unless it be a true reflection of the beliefs 
of the entire student body. With no encouragement of freelance editorials among'others than the staff, it may be possible 
to minimize occasional elements of discontent, by co-ordinating 
the opinion of the students and the administration.A collegiate newspaper is unfortunate in that by the time 
a group of persons become experienced and really valuable to 
the paper, they must graduate and talce with them this knowl
edge. The absence of the present senior staff and the loss of several contributors, including H. R. Wall, whose weekly column 
was of general interest, leaves large gaps to be filled immediate
ly. In this position it is fortunate that a goodly number, of 
underclassmen have shown the ambition to do their part.The twenty-sixth staff of the Tartan assumes their posi
tions without any extravagant promises for the future, but con
fident as a result of their own sinceritybut quite in accord 
with I In- prominent columnist who declares that while no man is entitled to acclaim on the basis of sincerity alone, with such 
u basis his future may be viewed with optimism.
The Tartan Platform
The Tartan Platform as presented for the first time by 
the present senior staff represents one of their most valu
able inovations. It purports to secure organized reforms 
by calling attention to definite improvements of desirable changes which affect both the students and the administra
tion. The new staff plans to compile a series of such ob
jectives upon which to base its editorial attitude and to 
publish this platform at the start of next year. A number of probable topics arc reviewed here:
An Activities Building 
While most everyone realizes that the only major objection 
towards creating an activities building at Carnegie seems to be on the basis of financial reasons, the matter will no doubt con 
tinue to be thrust aside unless the problem is commonly con
sidered as a necessity. The importance of furnishing a building 
to the students which would offer club rooms, recreation rooms, 
an improved library, and centrally located offices for student activities, should be of considerable interest to the administra
tion as^vell as to the students. When such a time has come to pass this project may be lifted from the limbo of the financially unable. \
. K.Support of the Year Book
Perhaps discussion on this question will be unnecessary as 
the student council has already passed, and the executive board is at present considering the advisability of raising the activities 
fee slightly, giving that sum to the support of the Thistle, and 
in turn giving every student a free copy of the year book. In 
case the project is held up this year the agitation for its in
auguration will no doubt continue, and the Tartan will offer its aid in sponsoring the movement.
Engineering Curriculum 
In the same breath with the complaints of too heavy a schedule for the engineering students, there comes the com
plaint of a curriculum, while fine in its technical background, 
but somehow lacking in subjects which will aid the student in becoming more than a technical grind. Perhaps the 
occasion for speeches by the .graduating seniors at recent, 
banquets has brought home the realization that many of 
these men are totally unprepared to present to the world the 
benefits of their technical knowledge. In this one field of public speaking a great deal could be accomplished by mak
ing more universal the discussion type of seminar calling for student leadership.
Inter-Mural Sports 
The recent broadening of the scope of inter-mural sports 
at Carnegie has called attention to the rather inefficient man
agement of this field of activity. The Interfraternity Council should be-released of the support of this activity and freed to 
devote its time to problems more involved in fraternal organiza
tion, and a definite board established to sponsor the sports. An 
athletic board comprised of fraternity and dormitory representa
tives, together with members of the school athletic board could give the sports the impetus they desefve.
Honorary Fraternities
The Washington and Jefferson campus newspaper has for 
'I the features of its platform, the elimination of needless 
rv societies and the strengthening of worthy ones. Perthe disapproval of the large number of honoraries is not 
lccted at the worthiness of their aims or purpose but rather 
a result of the over-commercialism in this field, where personal greed often results ip unjust fees levied in payment for the honor bestowed.-
From the Fence
Howdy, Yo All!
In the middle of the last week be
fore the final exams, the campus has 
that quiet, tense atmosphere that pre
cedes a storm. A lot of people arc 
wishing they had studied more dur
ing the early part of the year, while 
a lot more, including most of the 
seniors, arc just passively and bliss
fully ignorant. The seniors received 
letters last week telling them what 
to do to graduate, PROVIDING the 
little informalities of next week arc 
successfully passed through. Recep
tion of a letter doesnt mean gradua t i o n, but its psychologically 
strengthening.
The drive is on for new members 
of the Alumni Federation. Member
ship includes such adavntages as a 
subscription to the Carnegie Alumnus, 
first choice of fpotball tickets, in 
case any graduate has enough money 
by next fall to buy tickets, and a 
subscription to that never-failing 
source of entertainment and educa
tion, The Carnegie Tartan. (Kindly 
show that rowdy the door, Officer I) 
All those prospective graduates who 
have $2.00 will please step forward 
and submit said quantity of money, 
to receive in return one  beautifully 
engraved identification card and one 
white button. We say "prospective 
graduates" because their $2.00 
just as good as anybody elses, 
whether they graduate or not.
The American Institute of Electri
cal Engineers, Carnegie Chapter, held 
their annual banquet at the PcnnLincoln Hotel Wednesday evening. 
This is the only occasion of the 
year when' the students may make 
fun of the professors and get away 
with it. Denny" Dennison, with the 
aid of some of his hot air, made a 
monkey out of a piece of rubber, 
instead of one of the seniors, as is 
his custom. George D. C. Porter 
was told that lie was getting thin 
and now is merely-a shadow of the 
Graf Zeppelin. Doc Work was 
cuscd of "absent-minded professor 
tcndehcics.
The girls in Cedar Hall enjoyed a 
three-day vacation last Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday, whin they were 
quarantined for scarlet fever pos
sibilities. The situation caused com
plications of surprising kinds. Luck
ily, no gentleman hdbituc of Cedar 
Hall was there when the Health 
Officer arrived, so the quarantine 
was limited to girls. They made the 
best of things by sitting and danc
ing on the front porch in what look
ed to us like P. Js, or overalls, 
while the male friends parked in a 
row on the lawn. The kindliness of 
fate, or somebody, let the girls out 
of quarantine in time to attend the 
Mellon Formal Saturday night.

Unwarranted Publicity
Censure in some measure is due the Pittsburgh papers 
for the type of publicity given Carnegie in regard to the recent murder of Roy Sloan. To seize upon the fact 
that this person once had a minor connection with Carnegie 
Tech, and use this basis for screaming headlines which 
would lure the public, is a measure which if true, would still be a questionable character.
A special edition of one of the daily newspapers appear
ed and was sold on the steps of this college to students attracted by the fact that the headlines proclaimed a scandal 
concerning an ^ Ex-Tech Student. Proper investigation 
into the .collegiate career of this individual reveals that a number of years] ago lie was registered as a night student 
and then only for a period of three months, until he was 
dropped because of failure to attend classes.
We recognize that the attitude of the Pittsburgh .papers 
was not meant as personal affront, but doubtless a result.of the desire to furnish the public with a sensation and to en
hance sales by supplying stories with personal interest. Legally 
the local press was within its proper bounds, but is it not true 
that glaring misrepresentation of facts is a poor policy for any 
paper. The effect of such policies on the reading public is to develop an element of distrust towards other newspaper material which may prove to be more genuine.

1,000 different varieties of shrub

boys and girls dormitories, and 
approximately 90 shade trees have 
been placed in various sections 
about the campus. Along with 
provisions for filling, .grading and 
draining the new field behind the 
girls dormitories on Woodlawn

a line of lilac, honeysuckle and

SENIORS URGED

Thomas S. Baker, President 
"I wish to urge jupon the mem
bers of the graduating class of 1931 
the desirability of joining immedi
ately the "Alumni Association. The 
Carnegie alumni body now numbers 
about six thousand. It is a splen
did group of energetic men and 
women whose influence throughout 
the country is becoming every year 
more potent.
The advantages of a feeling of 
solidarity among all Carnegie grad
uates are obvioqs though it is ad
vantageous not'only to the institu
tion itself but also to each individ
ual alumnus. It is .therefore most 
fitting that each man and woman 
should ally himself immediately 
with the Alumni Association and 
\york with his fellow graduates for 
the advancement of Carnegie. 
Director A. C. Jewett 
A diploma from, the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology is an asset 
of value to every graduate. You 
can increase the value of this asset 
by helping to advance your AlmaMa.cr and improve her reputation. 
There is no better way for you to 
do this than through membership 
in your Alumni Association. Join 
for mutual profit.

it is hard to realize that a few 
months may mean such a complete 
break with Alma Mater as occurs 
so often in the life of the recent 
graduate. It seems axiomatic that 
a relationship which has been so 
natural will continue without any 
ipecial effort on ones own part.
, "Experience has demonstrated 
that this is not thecase and it is 
only by a positive effort on the part 
of the majority of the graduates 
that they will maintain even a 
moderate amount of interest in 
their college.
Perhaps this condition applies 
especially to engineering graduates 
bccause the nature of their employ
ment is 'such that they soon be
come scattered far from the home 
campus and often are forced to live 
in out-of-the-way places.
It is equally certain that in later 
years a desire will arise to re-visit 
the campus and renew old friend
ships and memories.
"Possibly a reference i$ needed, 
advice on a technical problem is 
wanted, or any one of a dozen rea
sons may arise which makes it de
sirable to get in touch with the office 
of the Alumni Association.
"No surer way to guarantee con
tinuity of interest in this associa
tion exists than to establish this re
lationship at graduation . and one 
never knows how early in' his ex
perience it may be necessary to call 
upon the officers of the association 
for aid.

THE PUBLIC NUISANCE
Dear Old Public Nuisance:
With the passing of your column, 
there passes from existence the most 
worthwhile innovation of the aca
demic year on the Carnegie Tech 
Campus. Although I agree with only 
a minority of your viewsprobably 
thaj holds true for many of those 
who. have read your column con
sistentlyI believe that you have 
succeeded in. performing a task that 
has been tried unsuccessfully many 
times by various people during the 
part of my life which I have spent 
here at Carnegie. It is this: you 
have stimulated thought in others. 
Few there arc, I grant, who would 
be willing to admit that one with 
your peculiar "mental,quirk, as you 
choose to call it-, could influence 
them in any manner whatever. 
Those mail}' doubters, however, often 
have  been seen glapcing , critically 
down your column, with wide-open 
eyes and slightly wrinkled brow, 
wondering just what they might find 
in the way 6f new words and new 
ideas, which were destined later to 
become the subject of a traditional 
collegiate bull-session.
I hive-been asked to try to carry 
on tlie work -which has been found
ed, has developed itself, and has 
come to be of foremost interest, all 
within a year. Mahy arc the topics
pupil is too. important on both sides 
to be lightly'sacrificed.

which, for want of time and space, 
have been left untouched; perhaps 
upon the presentation of some facts 
dealing with such subjects, campus 
eyes may be opened to a few things 
to which they arc still blind. It is 
my desire, however, that it be left . 
to the public itself whether or not 
the Public Nuisance shall be con
tinued. If individuals and organiza
tions on the campus consider the 
column to be worth the space it occupics, it would be fitting for them to 
voice their opinions in the form o 
letters. It is the suggestion of one 
student that the "Public Nuisance 
become a campus tradition along with 
the fence, the freshman regulations, 
and what have you, in order that 
it may be remembered as an integral 
part of the college life of every Carnegian. The amendment was made-'to 
that suggestion that each writer of 
the columnit bcring traditionally 
anonymoussign his character name 
followed by the proper Roman 
numeral.
If interest is shown in the column 
by readers of the Tartan, I shall 
do my best to maintain, even to de
velop further, that interest, although 
^ shall have to do this with a more 
limited vocabulary than that pos
sessed by its founder. I shall not 
consider the difference between the 
right and the wrong  side of any 
debatable questions to be of primary 
importance. You have built up the 
column with the sole purpose in 
mind of making it a "thought and 
idea stimulating function. So may it 
continue, and so may you continue 
in .life. With a wish that the best 
of luck may be yours, goodby!
