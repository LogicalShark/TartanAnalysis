Forbes Hall Fannex, the present 
possessors of high honors in wall 
smoking, roller skating and pulchri
tude, are proudly and defiantly an
nouncing their latest challengethe 
completion of an entire dress 
through the combined, efforts, of 
three Home Economics students, 
Ruth Elaine Nye, Becky Linn and 
Bernice Converse.
Actual proof of this challenge 
is unfortunately lacking at the 
present, but the girls  themselves 
loudly proclaim the assertion and 
demand the credit due them. Tire
some ' afternoons spent tramping 
through the various shops of town, 
long evenings spent plying the. 
needle, and then that final - week 
of charette when no one dared 
disturb the intense atmosphere 
broken only by the hum of the 
sewing machine. Such ordeals arc 
decried by these girls now recciv 
ing popular acclaim.
When questioned as to how thejr 
managed to stand the torrid pace 
that permitted- this remarkable 
achievement, the girls were unani
mous in their answer that after 
two years in chemistry lab they 
could stand anything. Tlie recent 
addition to Fannys Fannex in the 
form of bright red burglar alarms 
were also mentioned as aiding in 
restoring confidence to the gi;-ls 
 that they might obtain their rest 
undisturbed. Gone was the neces
sity of sleeping with one eye open 
so as not to be asleep if any un
announced midnight visitors ap
peared. It might be mentioned, 
however, that in connection with 
this idea, the girls pn the. second 
floor, accentuated by jealousy or 
other motives, declare the repeated 
stories of robbers arc coming from 
girls often guilty of bragging, and 
furthermore the upstairs girls de
clare they believe that the day of 
the second-story man surely must 
be passing.
Carnegie Guild Squanders Tag 
Day Receipts
Righteous Students League 
Demands Resignation 
of President
President Buys Cadillac
The resignation of Miss Elsa 
Weber, president of the Carnegie 
Guild, and her* Board of Directors, 
including Agnes Harmon, Ellen 
Vandcr Yoort, and Janet McClelland, 
has been demanded by the Righteous 
Students League of Carnegie, includ
ing Joe Cooke, Margaret Accipiter, 
Bill Bryant and Marian McNary, 
after an investigation of the ap
propriation of the $50,000 funds 
realized from the recent Guild tag 
day on the Carnegie Campus.
The investigation was spurred when 
Miss Weber appeared shortly after 
the tag day in a jrcllow Cadillac 
roadster which was fitted with cusr 
tome built tires and a blazing gold 
monogram.
A visit to the Guilds palatial 
suite in the William Penn Hotel re
vealed that the apartment was fur
nished lavishly. Oriental rugs and 
tapestries covered the floors and 
walls. Luxurious divans, lounges, and 
lamps were scattered everywhere. 
The .Guild Frigidaire contained the 
rarest of delicacies. The committee 
Avas most astonished by the uniformed 
butler who greeted them at the door.
Although seven bids were ** made 
for the Guild tags, ranging from
$1,000--to $5,000, the order was given 
to the highest bidder, Student Coun
cil being unaware of the other of
fers.
When the committee visited- the 
foundling home maintained by the 
Guild, they were astonished by the 
dire hunger of the waifs. When
the daily menu of . Miss Webers
Pekinese poodle was compared with 
the daily menu of a foundling the
following were the results:

Police Raid Mary Greens Apartment
Federal Agents Find Large 
Supply of Contraband Goods 
During Mortar Board Party
Raid Follows Investigation of Rumors About 
Frequent Tea Parties Given By Miss 
Green in Her Apartment
A large supply of contraband goods were seized by Federal agents 
in a raid on,the fashionable Oakland apartment of Mary Green, widely 
known educator, traveler, and social leader. The raid was the first in 
a series. planned to break up a highly organized and powerful ring 
which supplies a high grade of contraband to wealthy people in the 
larger cities. Police for the past six months have been investigating 
rumors of frequent so-called "tea parties given by Miss Green in her 
apartment for Pittsburgh society folk and for prominent members of 
the Carnegie Tech student body.
Conclusive evidence that precipitated 
the raid was obtained by a Secret 
Service operator who gained admit
tance to a party given by Miss Green 
for the Student Council by posing 
as the President of the Industries 
College Senior Class. His guise was 
perfect since the students never 
know who the class officers arc.
The raid was ' made at the height 
of a party given for the Mortar 
Board Society which is made up of 
the female politicians of the Senior 
Class. Miss Green, gowned in her 
elaborate Chinese wrap, was presid
ing and had just dispensed a quantity 
of her famous contraband from her 
equally famous Chinese tea pot, 
when the Federal agents broke in.
Miss Green and her guests were 
herded into patrol wagons and rush
ed *to the Oakland police - station.
The Mortar Board members were re
leased . because of their tender age 
but Miss Green was held under 
$50,000 bail.
Police officials thought that per
haps other members of the admin
istration and facult. might be in
cluded in the ring scandal but in
vestigation disclosed that Mary 
Green was the only member who 
had .any connection with the ring.
President Baker was absolved of 
suspicion bdcausc he has spent most 
of his time in Paris.

LEPROSY PLAGUES 
MARGARET MORRISON
A sudden epidemic of leprosy was 
3'esterday reported to the Board of 
Health following diagnosis of the dis
ease among all the senior students 
in the Margaret Morrison Science 
Department. The cases arc traced to 
exposure to the germ suffered re
cently when the girls were, required 
to make a study of the disease in 
a class conducted by Miss Martha P. 
Eggers, M.S., University of Pennsyl
vania. .
In interview, Miss Eggers refused 
to make a statement. She said, I 
cant understand how such a thing 
could have happened. We hoped that 
it might occur, but n<&er dreamed 
that our hopes would1'be realized so 
promptly. Our reason for the at
tempt was the unusually large num
ber of seniors in the department 
this 3'ear. We could not hope to find 
jobs for all of them and thought 
that this was the easiest way' not 
to disappoint them. We are consider
ing several very nice leper; colonies 
where we expect them to. continue 
research in their chosen fields.

POLICE SMASH 
DORM m RING
Arrest Drama Students in 
Raid on Welch 
Hall
A national college rum ring and 
chain of gambling joints were smash
ed last night in a raid on 110 Welch 
Hall when ^ City . police arrested two 
Drama Students, confessed owners 
of the joint. From police records, 
they have been identified as Clancy 
Cooper and Leo Daschbacli, ring
leaders of this college syndicate. This 
hang-out was discovered to be fre
quented by the members, of the 
Drama Department faculty 'and stu
dents.
At the -time of the raid, the archi
tects, who were there by special in
vitation, were found sitting at the 
far end of the room' drinking CocaCola and playing Honeymoon Bridge. 
Dick Burrell, henchman of Cooper 
and Daschbach,. was standing beside 
a large roulette wheel raking in the 
coin. Booze Kountz was managing 
the drink concession and was caught 
rcdhanded doling out Gordon gin 
and Golden Wedding.
T h e police discovered i n a 
closet George Kimberly gagged and 
bound. In an explanation by Bur
rell, he has been "on the spot for 
a long time for running his racket 
into the Cooper-Daschbach territory, 
and when he was caught skulking 
outside the door last night, he was 
seized for a killing. Police of Scot
land Yard and members of the 
French Intelligence System have been 
looking for Kimberly, alias TwoFaced Al, for the past year as 
assassinatorof the Austrian archduke, 
Francis Ferdinand. Lloyd Wenniger, 
Dean Curry, and Bob Atkins were 
arrested on the grounds as suspicious 
persons and were later identified by 
Cooper as Kimberlys body guards, j 
It is feared that if they arc re
leased on bail, members of the 
Cooper-Daschbach outfit will bump 
them off. Bertha Thompson is being 
held for jumping arrest at the Uni
versity of Michigan where she was 
the gun-woman of the branch joint 
there. Everybody in the room was 
arrested. Blackjacks had to be used 
to subdue two members of the 
Drama Faculty, E. W. Hickman and 
B. Idcn Paine, the- latter resisting 
arrest with well-aimed cane.
The Kimberly and Kountz-Daschbach-Coopcr-Btjrrel! outfits were ex
posed by Burt McKee, according to 
patrons of 110 Welch, came in earlier 
in the evening and made friends. 
He was rackctecred for $1,000, and 
in a fit of apparent rage he tipped 
off the police. The Drama Depart
ment, usually a scene' of activity is 
deserted this morning due to the raid, 
practically the whole department
being held or trial.
ARTS BALL OPEN TO ENGINEERS
The annual Arts Ball, the one time when the Dramats are 
accepted as correct companions, has finally conic lo sane con
clusion in throwing their party open to the remainder of the 
school. All engineers, even commercials, and. industries stu
dents, with the exception of printers will be admitted free, pro
viding , they bring a dcaccnt date and their own liquor. The 
printers-being used to a type of their own must remain on the 
probation list until such men as Social Lion Conway" improve 
their taste in women. . ,
Hal Brennan, the big shot behind this years ball, states defi
nitely that all must attend in Spanish costume, even if only a 
shawl can be found.' In case one finds trouble getting to
gether a costumc, just come late and pick one out of the check 
room. Hot music will not be lacking with Mary Green lead
ing a colored band in a. rendition of the famous Tiger Rag. 
Also Buzz Kountz absolutely promises not to wear tails" and 
to leave the orchestra alone.

NIGHT CLUB ENTERTAINER,SHOT BY J
Two Tech Professors 
Held; Faculty of Car
negie is Horrified
Miss Minnie Helm, 22 3rears old, 
a night club entertainer, whose 
professional name is Mintiie 
Holmes, was shot in the large 
phalanx of the right foot in front 
of the recently opened Paradise 
Regained Club, 70 Best Amour 
street, yesterday morning. Her as
sailant, a tall, bald-headed man,

The shooting occurred during an 
altercation between Dr. Harry 
Seitz, who had spent the previous 
evening and morning at the club, 
and the gunman over which 'one 
should take the girl to Carnegie 
Tech, where she teaches.
The shot was fired after Scltz 
had rudely removed the girl from 
the taxi in which the interloper 
had placed her, Scltz, who claimed 
that lie abhorred physical fights, al
lowed the gunman to escape ' and 
then drove the girl to the Mercy 
Hospital.
Questioned by the police there 
Miss Helm refused to identify the 
man who had shot her other than 
that he was an admirer named 
Hymic. Supplied with informa
tion from several Carnegie Tech 
eds, the detectives, under the 
direction of Chief Charlie Stanton, 
assisted by Detective Grouchy' 
Alexander, famous cross-examiner,

Pool Room Fiends 
Hold Blowout At Risedorph Shanty
The Carnegie swimming team held 
its annual post-season party at the 
home of Coach Risedorph last week. 
Plans were carried out on a strictly 
liquid- basis, and by the time the 
night was over everyone had a sous
ing good time. It was reported that 
they, played bridge and old maid the 
entire evening, but a later inspection 
proved that no bridge was built, and 
that the boys left the domicile well 
aware of their masculinc qualities.
It was necessary for the members 
of the team to climb to the roof 
and dcsccnd through the chimncy for 
the Riscdorphs had pointed their 
placc with six feet of water. The 
boys took to the tactics that they 
had learned in the Boy Scouts, and 
manuvcrcd abuut the rooms with '.he 
frce-stylc or back0 stroke. However, 
it was annoying to some of the 
visitors*, to loose the crease in their 
pants. But AI Redding never gave it 
a thought for he had no crease to 
begin with.
The card tables were floating 
around in various places, having lost 
their anchors when the radio let 
loose with "Anchors Awcigh. The 
monotony of bridging was interrupted 
when Ted Eastabrookc discovered 
that the King of Spades had drifted 
out the window with the Queen of 
Hearts. The scandle turned for the 
worse when Jcrgc returned from the 
rescue with the eloping pair and an 
additional ducc.
A ccrtaii amount of interest was 
centered about Bill Edwards for lie 
was juit crowned the* captain of the 
next year'. swimming club. Bill was 
sailing along in great style through 
the bridge game until those hairs of 
his mustache became drcnchod. This 
was most unfortunate for the burn; 
cork was washed away and tho?e 
present seized the opportunity to 
make an actual count of the number 
on ea..h side. The results were most 
astounding.
Cadmii, took first prize in the higli 
point column for the evening. The 
secret of his success is due to the 
fact that he played dummy for each

SEEINS BELIEVIN
The deeper emotions of Murray 
Giles were searched, with startling 
results, for the true story of his 
desire for increased wealth. It 
seems that at the very bottom of it 
all is a woman, and the worst of 
it is, she is a teacher. Whether 
the teacher has taught him well 
is a remote question, but, from all 
accounts, Army has developed into 
the most attentive student of late. 
This situation is linked with the 
frequent appearance of Giles in the 
Carrick neighborhood. Draw your 
own conclusions.
Armcntrout is interested in an 
enlarged dollar mark also because 
of his extensive plans for a sec
ond round-the-world trip, taking 
place next summer. Ho made such 
a noble impression upon the crowncd heads of Europe and the black
heads of Africa on his first visit 
that his friends have invited him 
for another stay. For additional

Course Of Events Is Moved Ahead Four Hours
Last Saturday afternoon the Car
negie pool preformed a notnblc serv
ice to the communities of Pittsburgh. 
It afforded a means by which1 350 
high school kids received a thorough 
Saturday night cleaning, or more 
widely known as Carnegies second 
annual swimming relays.
The meet was run off in round 
teaks of the junior and senior 
classes. Twenty-six teams took to 
the water, fifteen and one half 
crossed tiic finish line, a dozen were 
pulled out with the hook, and the 
rest arc swimming this very minute.
Duqucsnc High was awarded the 
team cup in the senior class because 
they won some of the races some of 
the  time.
Langley High won the junior cup, 
holding two and three-quarters pints 
by weight, simply because their men 
seemed to get back before the rest 
of them. .
For the reason that he worked 
everything into running order, Coach 
Risedorph was automatically the 
meet director. Of course Henry 
But* was the clerk, and the rotund 
Henry Blum over-filled the positions 
of decider and beginner.
As an added attraction John Joseph 
Boyle, the editor of this very pamph
let, gave a special exhibition of 
his gun-boat shoes which propelled 
him through the water at will. This 
is an vinvqntion of Jacks that he 
claims will revolutionize ocean travel

JALONACK SPIRIT
Bulletin: Special lo the Tartan 
MR. IRWIN GEORGE JALO 
NACK, head of the committee in 
charge of tho Inter-Fratcrnity-Dor* 
mitory Basketball Leagues, star 
basketeer of the Welsh Hall quin
tet, and famous conversationalist, 
announced last nifcht that lie 
would run the 100 yard dasli' and 
high jump for the Tartans this 
year. Mr. Jalonack will go into 
training at once.
At present the Carnegie campus 
is in a state of turmoil and excite
ment. The. underlying motive is based 
open the astounding fact that faculty 
and stuHents have been swept by the 
gigantic tide of the fascinating game 
of Pjng-pong. A growing interest 
has been noticed for the past few 
weeks, and today Carnegie cats and 
sleeps in' the realm of Ping Pong.
Our own Dean Tarbcll is an ardent 
lover of the sport and has prescrib
ed a game each morning before 
breakfast to creatc an appatitc and 
to waken the-mind. Coach Hover has 
designated Ping Pong as the off
season training for his tennis stars, 
and there is danger of it sub'-planting 
the outdoor game altogether. It was 
also' revealed that cach fraternity 
house has a sub-basement where the 
members secretly and seriously en
joy the enticing game of Ping-Pong.
The purpose of this articlc is not 
to give an explanation of how to 
play the game, hut it will contain 
just a mere glimpse of the true story 
of Ping-Pong and how it has climb
ed to the heights of ,a national pas
time.
The entire credit for the invention 
of Ping-Pong belongs to the Jong 
brothers who were twins, in fact 
they still arc to ll is day. For the 
sake of simplicity we will just call 
them Mr. First Jong and Mr. Sec
ond Jong, for tjicir appearance was 
surely in that oidcr. Their initial 
rise to fame resulted from their in
vention of the old" ladies game, 
"Malia Jong. Since that time the 
Jong brothers have been activc 
civic and circular circles.
The essence of Ping-Pong occurcd 
to Mr. First Jong while he was 
watching two Italian fruit venders 
engaged in a heated argument 
across a table. Evidently the heat of 
the argument was not great enough 
for the two peddlers so they began 
throwing onions at each other. In
stead of dodging the missiles, the 
victims battled them down with their 
hands. Being fresh spring onions, 
they bounced too and frow. The 
wheels began to click and then all 
was plain.to Mr. Jong. He visioned 
a net between the two men with 
racqucts in their hands, and so his 
life work was cut out.
The Jong brothers realized that in 
order to make Ping-Pong a national 
pastime it must be a fast ganic. They 
were after a sport that would with
stand the gaff pf the mighty foot
ball playct and, at the satne> time, 
appeal to the fcmirtattty of society 
To accomplish this the ball must be 
of a type that wili afford the least 
possible res.st.ince so as to'- give 
very fast movements.
The incident of how the Jong 
brothers discovered such a ball, 
described above, is indeed an inter
esting one. It was in the wet-Fall of 
1918 when the twins were hunting 
for an unknown species, eillcd 
dungus fromoci, in the wilds of 
South Africa. Their efforts were re
warded one day when they come 
upon rlie nest of a bird by the native 
name of Wing-wang. in this nest 
they found queer idepoifts which, 
strange as it seems, have turned ou: 
to'be the high and mighty Ping-Pong 
ball of today.
The Wing-wan,-; bird has tlu habit 
of flying batkwards to keep the dust 
out of its eyes. In a few weeks the 
laying capacity of a single (?): Wingwang is able to satisify over half 
the ranking ping-pongcrs of the 
Architect's Department. This egg is 
suitable for its conforms to the es
sential requirement of being filled

with air. Of course all dggs can not 
be pcrfcctly spherical,, so if you 
come across a lopsided Ping-Pong 
ball yoli will know the reason why !
The eggs of the Wing.wang bird 
have an average life of approximately 
5,000 bounces, that is, when used in 
the game of Ping-Pong. Profes
sional Ping Pongists will use only 
balls of thci:vcry lat'dst stbek, iftid 
loud curses arc heard 'when tii'c 
sphere will not rebound to its 
iginal height. When reaching its last 
bounces the Ping-Pong ball will 
gradually cliangc its sound. The 
genius of the game will immediately 
realize this when he no longer hears 
the sweet ping and pong of the 
ball, but listens to a decided punk.

In the years to come the Spring 
of 1931 will always be remember
ed by Carnegie Students as the 
time of a gigantic merger of two 
dynamic forces on the Carnegie 
campus. The Music and the Athr 
letic departments have: made a de
cided step toward the -welding of 
two courses into a single one, 
thereby gaining more efficiency. 
These results were reached after 
lengthy bickerings between Vick 
O'Brien-, the music master,' and 
Buddy Overend, supported by his 
able assistant Dubby Endovercnd.
The present plans call fbr experi
mental work with the track candi
dates. The music students will 
bring their instruments and acces
sories down to the bowl every 
afternoon t,o bow or blow any note 
that may be in their hand or
mouth, whichever the case may be. 
The theory Of the practice is that 
the melody will keep . the runners

rhythm will give him the urge to 
Coach Halferty has studied 
the ins and outs of everything, and 
has acclaimed this the most bril*- 
liant step toward producing a well 
groomed , cir\dcr-poundcr.
The leader will strike up the 
band, and then the Plaid runners 
step out with the same time
the music. Faster pieces with 
6-S, or even 12^-17^2 .time will
be needed for the short sprints, 
while we still cxpect to see Jesse 
Price coVer the half mile to the 
tunc of a waltz or possibly a fox 
trot. Spectators should not be 
alarmed to see a fiddler drop 
work and take to the track; it  is 
all in being an artisi,
The musicians will play an im
portant role in the meets. They 
will tunc up with the runners, 
play a typical piece during

know what to expect. The trumpetccrs will announce the events as

the coach will' give the signal to 
the leader who will speed Up the 
tempo. Now the runner is requir
ed to step lively to keep up with

of ten he will win the race. This 
modern strategy throws the oppo

victory.for Carnegie.
All drummers work hand in hand

that Karcis .and Armcntrout are 
liable to throw their equipment out

musicians.

Eighteen prominent faculty mem
bers arc in the Bastile today, 
thanks'to-the efforts of the Scalds' 
Detktivc Agency. The Scalds 
men have been working for three 
\Yceks on this case, and, until 
last night, were completely balTlcd. 
The mystery is now solved, how ever, and many night students may 
expect a public apology:
It would seem that these eight
een villians were suspected of dis
connecting the city drinking water 
.supply during exam, week and 
substituted instead a supply of 
their own from a secret source, 
which water contained sufficient 
drugs, chiefly laudanum, to 
put the large majority of their 
victims in such a lethargic state 
that almost all who drank the wa
ter flunked their tests;
Doc. Warner was the first person 
to noticc anything strange. He 
found' that his gin exploded, upon 
being mixed with the water dur
ing that period only, and conse
quently started an investigation.
The clue leading to the solution 
of the crime and the apprehension 
I of the criminals was divulged, at 
a whoopee party' in Dr. Bartos 
office. The statement that "this 
liquor is worse than- the water, 
was," was overheard by the night 
watchman who promptly died* of, a 
broken heart, after writing, a full 
story.of what lie had heard.
Speech Made By Prime 
Minister of Ruralia At 
Kings Farewell Party
The Prime Minister's speech has 
-many sterling qualities and was' as 
follows:
"To. his royal Highness, King of 
Ruralia, Blodge and Stroftn, Em
peror of Engs wedge, Giotz and 
Hiedstrach; Duke of Trans-Bipthulo, Organt and Stopft; Prince, of 
Schlcppit-Blatz, Esquilph and Buntif; Protector of Qunrtbndolle, 
Crown Prince of Mcliontizapxt; 
ruler of Etaoin-Shrdlu, and the De

Many times during the spccch, 
the Prime Minister was forced to 
stop loy several hours to allow- the 
commotion due ,to the / applause to

the king with a gun and a bottl 
of Potasium Cyanide, and, After 
expressing the wish that he would

REMISSION
Announcement that all students 
who failed in Mathematics this 
semester will be omitted to repeat 
next year free of charge has arous
ed a good deal of resentment, es
pecially among the night engineers. 
This group feels that the faculty 
is playing them for fishes, consid
ering that there hasnt been a 
"Math, flunk in engineering fot 
eighty-four years, come Michaelmas, 
due to the generosity of O. T. 
Geckler, et al.
There is sonic possibility, how
ever, of the ruling going into ef
fect in an effort to keep the math
ematics profession happy. The 
professors peace of min'd varies di
rectly as the"flunks and inverse
ly, as the square of the passes, so 
with this added incentive towards 
plunking, the students should be 
willing to do their bit to make 
these poor men happy.
The plan will include the pur
chase of sedatives, opiates, and 
rubber hammers to enable tile pro
fessors to keep Mr, Gecklers hil
arity within porper limits after 
more than seventy-five per cent of 
the engineers calmly flunk.
NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Investigation of the Tcnpercentoff Theory has proved that four 
out of five have it and the fifth 
man is a liar. In all cases, -the, 
use of a hammer is frowned on, 
unless the watch reacts with 
hydrogen sulphide, causing the air
plane to take a deeper cut, which 
allows the fork to be tuned with 
an axe.
Use of the Brzyspnk formula for 
integrating expressions containing 
infinity has been sanctioned by the 
Ancient and Honorable Order of 
Unnattf'ral Philosophers. M. Brzyspnk has not yet started to work 
on the theory, but promises that 
there will be prosperous times 
soon.
Metallurgists will be interested in 
knowing that a new type of baking 
powder recently developed will pre
vent rolls fr.om becoming sticky 
before baking.
Investigation of the continued 
frequency of sand-storms in many

proved that a large number 'of

DEAN SCOFFS AT 
IMPENDING ROMANCE
Rurgors that Dean Tarbcll in
tends to separate his other wives 
and announce his engagement to 
Mrs. Mary Grcnc have been lent 
credence by . an astounding discov
ery made a few days ago. The 
Dean was found looking through 
a Sears-Rocbuck catalogue, and 
seemed very interested in the lat
est models of the ducky new two* 
seated bicycles. He refused to be 
quoted, however, and merely an
nounced that there was no truth 
in the recent rumor that he and 
Prof. Lcighou had been arrested 
recently for upsetting apple-sellers 
stands while in a toxic moodc. He 
insists that President -Baker, and 
not Prof. Lcighou, was his accom
plice.
Mrs. Greene, with her usual 
tact and diplomacy, assumes a very 
reticent and innocent attitude. It 
has been very hard to obtain any 
information from her since she was 
rudely interrupted by the Night 
Student Council as she was about 
to elope with a greasy little hound 
that was bounced from the last 
Council dance for being shrunk, 
and whom she befriended. '
It is suspected that Dean Tarbell's place will be filled by Mayor 
Kline, after the Deans distracted 
honeymoon. The Mayor has had 
his eye on Mrs. Greene for. quite a 
while, and there is some talk that 
the Dean will retire in the Mayor's 
favor as something of a compro
mise.

it is against the law. They said I 
could write oh College studies, nearbeer, sarsaparilla or mother-in-laws, 
but not on intoxicant or spiritous

There arent as many mother-inlaws now as before prohibition.

Dean Tarwell Seeks Safety From 
Night Student Council Riot
Night Student Council President Assassinated
M. Crawford, radical wing of 
tile Night Student Council, was 
hailed dictator by the councilors 
after the foul murder of Pres. 
Sjuisonctti. Acting officially, Pres. 
Sansonetti called for order during 
a hot discussion and was promptly 
stabbed by Councilor Crawford. 
The wcopon used was the official 
Night Student Council scissors, 
with which Councilor Crawford had 
been trimming Bill Hoddcrs hair 
prior- to the assassination.
Crawford was immediately chal
lenged to a due by McDonald and 
Werner, and after an exchange of 
crcam-puffs at 600 yards, Crawford 
was declared victor. The losers 
paid for the crcam-puffs, and the 
remaining council members ate 
them.
A great deal is expected from 
the new dictator and the loving 
students presented him with a 
bronze tablet declaring their loy
alty and warning-him that they can 
stand only so much,
Dear . Miss Barefacts: I am a
yolllig boy of '43 summers arid ditto 
number of winters. I am a nigilt 
art student arid have fallen deeply 
in love with a fair co-ed 15 years 
my senior. She isnt very beautiful, 
but her old man's got piles of 
dough and several big cars. She 
doesnt give me a tumble. What 
can I do to win her love.
For Arts sake, 
Architect Dick.
Dear Artichoke  Dick: Her most 
strenuous exercise is avoiding your 
glances. May i suggest Listcrinc.
Dear Miss Bcarfacts: Yesterday I 
catch my Katrina wid the icemans 
lap she sill on. I mak sore at me, 1 
should do what?
Yakah Volgcrschlootz.
Dear Yakah Volgcrschlootz: Your 
kalrina loves only you. If you arc 
ever troubled with icemans lap again, 
use the same treatment as prescribed 
for housemaids knee.
tomorrow? Now what do you think 
of the "Mechanical Woman idea?"
Well anyway the following Mon
day, while visiting a friends office, 
I was attacked with a terrible tooth
ache. My friend informed me that 
the window directly across the air 
shaft belonged.to a very good dentist. 
Looking over I saw the Doc. getting 
ready to leave so I picked up the 
phone ill hopes of catching him and 
getting some relief. I could see him 
pick up the phoneand after my 
requestsay No, I cant give you an 
appointment this afternoon, I have 
eighteen cavities to fill and then I 
saw him turn, pick up his-golf clubs 
and go out.
Oh! what spring will do to the 
world. Look what its done to/me.
(Editors NoteThrough a highly 
developed "grapevine system this pa
per had heard that the Night Stu
dent Council ivas to hold a special 
meeting at which several important 
faculty members were to be present 
to hear valuable testimony on a much 
mooted question. Desiring to have 
all this information made public, a 
reporter was secrctcd in the coun
cil chamber, disguised as a cuspidor, 
to secure a true report of the meet
ing, which folloius here.)
Pres. Sansonetti: This meeting
is now called to order. We will 
dismiss reading of the minutes of 
the last meeting for the benefit of 
our guests. (Aside, swell idea, eh, 
Doc.) The purpose of this meet
ing is to consider expulsion of the 
Administrative Board from Car
negie Tech. The question is open 
for discussion.
WernerHey, Jim, how about 
getting this gang to install more 
lights along Engineering walk? It's 
so dark we cant read the Puppet 
over there.
Graham"I object.- Bright lights 
always make a bad joke look 
worse.
Fitzgerald"Aw, you guys dont 
know when your well off. I wish 
they would take some away from 
the arts school.
Pres. SansonettiYou . fellows 
quit worrying about lights and 
lets get down to business.
CrawfordNo kidden, Mr. Pres
ident, but I think We, as a body, 
should endorse the placing of 
more phones in Machinery Hall. 
Why, evcrytitnc I want to call my 
friends and collegucs I have to 
walk over to Industries and thus 
waste too much time.
Simpson"Watsa matter, Matt., 
tant lame d,ucks walk that far? 
Hudale"How about some re
freshments-with those puns? Hey 
Buzz, lets put on a dance act 
ior these bums.
Doci Baker"Now, boys, I in
sist that I be allowed to join you. 
During my last visit to Paris, I 
learned the latest dance of the 
season; boy, is it hot? heh, lieh. 
Let' me show you..
Ihrig"Look here, Tommy Ba'cer, lets go about this in the right 
jvay. First well call up Miss Sav\ge and get her to send up those 
rough riders she had at the En
gineering banquet and then 
Lcighou"And how about giving 
the boys some good . wrestling 
holds like those Geyser knows. 
Pres. Sansonetti. "Now look 
here, you there. If you dont sit 
down and behave, well deduct ten 
per c.cnt from your salarylaugh 
that off.
BakerAw, now wc didnt mean 
my harm-y-wc only
McDonold"Dont let him kid 
you Doc. Ill do the dance with 
you, and how.

order to thrust his thorny This

sion until an undertaken had to be 
called to carryx out the remains.

voucher for funeral expenses. 
GeyserMr. PresidentI object, 
as a member of this body, I object. 
Ever since the' Revolutionary War 
and down through turbulant-^history to the administration of Char
lie Kline and our illustrious co
worker, Buck McGovern, have such 
bodies as ours championed the 
cause of the down trodden. This 
procedure is fundamentally wrong 
and I ,will read a paper I have 
prepared citing my reasons 
why ...
Geyser got no further, a well 
aimed shot from Pres. Sansonetti's 
gun made him stop rather ab
ruptly.
HodderSay, Jim, does that go 
in the minutes?
After a heated discussion in 
which the chairman finally laid 
down the law, council decided to 
Strike this from the minutes.
PhillippiI hereby challenge 
Sledgehammer Baker to a sixround boxing match to decide the 
champion of the 400-pound class/ 
of C. I. T."
(P.C. Editors NoteFrom this 
point on the account is somewhat 
scrambled. From what is gathered, 
Doc. Baker accepted the challenge 
and immediately the rest of those 
members present separated into 
two opposing factions arid the 
match started. As the fight be
came more furious several other 
members became active participants 
until the reporter could stand the 
strain no longer, and decided to 
join the festivities himself.)

It doesnt'seem possible that of

at an institution as rank as Car

Endowment Fund to Be

CONTROL CAMPUS WEEK
BEHIND THE FENCE
Dragons Adjourn Meeting 
Setting New InterCollegiate Record
The grand condlavc of the Coun
cil of Exalted Plcnipotcntarics, com
monly known as tlie Student Counconvcncd in solemn assembly 
yesterday at the last stroke of 
seven. Marvin Fox, the grand 
exalted Kingfisher, announced that 
the first question before the august 
body was the consideration of the 
deposition of the endowment fund 
which was unexpectedly increased 
by the profits from the Women's 
Junior prom.
Kingfisher. Simpson moved that 
the endowment fund be turned 
over to the Dragons. Dragon Cooke 
seconded the motion. A discussion 
followed in which it developed that 
the Dragons had worked very hard 
all year for the good of the school. 
Much of their precious time from 
'dating had been given over to 
special meetings in which every 
matter of importance was properly 
hashed over and settled before 
presentation to council. Hence, it 
was felt that the Dragons should 
be given something to remember 
their Alma Mater by. Just a lit
tle remunerationenough to buy 
a new Suit, a shccpskiri, a degree 
ripg, and the price of ka Saturday 
night at Pirate Hall. A vote was 
taken, but it was a tic. According 
to Parliamentary law, when a tie 
occurs the president must vote. 
Marvin Fox put in 'his little aye" 
and since he, too, is a Dragon, 
the question was settled that the 
endowment fund should be turned 
over to that great and exalted 
bodythe Dragons.
Marvin Fox next appointed : 
committee to take care" of Campu 
Week.' The committee consisted 
of nine members, including eight 
Dragons. Since there arc only ten 
Dragons, Foxy regretted that he 
was unable to make the committee 
larger. At any rate, Ruth Liebcrman, the only member of the com
mittee who is not a Dragon, will 
not be able to voice an opinion 
since she is a member of th 
senior Mortar Board, which doesnt 
mean a thing.
Council meeting adjourned at six 
minutes after seven, as the meeting 
had already lasted three minute 
longer than customary.
Howdy, Yo All!
Your attention is respectfully called to the numerous features added to 
the Tartan by the enterprising (?) staff for your, and only your, entertain
ment. Severalnew columns and special features, such as Advice To The 
Lovc-Worli," by that eminent specialist in diseases of the cardiac organ, 
Dr. Nccllcy, have been added. tGrcat effort was expended to obtain the 
sage advice of this great man for Tartan readers. That his advice is ap
preciated may be easily seen f,rom the letters written to him by troubled, 
love-sick rcadcrs./It is hoped that other readers willnot let this opportun
ity pass in vain, but will submit their problems so that Dr. Nccllcy may 
pour out balm upon their troubled hearts. Do not be back-ward about, lay
ing bare your most secret thoughts, for even Dr, Nccllcy had his taoubles in 
his day. In addilion to this feature you will notice throughout the paper 
articles of, the greatest interest, including last minute dispatches. Yours for 
a bigger and baddcr Tartan.**********
4,nothcr of the Faculty party braivls was held Saturday night in the 
Union. As usual, the Faculty tried to keep the gathering a secret; and it 
was not until we happened to hear the noise while zualking near the Hut 
that we knew they had broken loose again and were disobeying campus 
ordinances by having a good time, and even shouting! Approaching the 
scene of disorder we noticed that the noise grc7U rapidly greater, until at 
the door of the Administration building the raucous shouts and guffaws 
-were clearly distinguishable. Intensely interested by such behavior, we 
climbed the stairs to the Union and looked on the proceedings, braving the 
glares and haughty glances that inevitably greet any student near a Faculty 
celebration. At the time, a play was going on, in the Union, with several 
faculty members comprising the cast. IVe were somewhat surprised to see 
the players merely going through the motions, with someone else reading 
the dialogue, but then we remembered that the faculty-playcrs had too many 
important things like Physics and Mathematics to remember to be memor
izing plays. The ghouls we had heard ivcre coming from several of the 
more rowdy among the audience, who. were audibly expressing their dislike 
for the proceedings. You can imagine our embarrassment when one of the 
rowdies came out with what is known among the "hoi polloi as a "razzberry." or birdie." We arc not sure, but we think the culprit luas a certain 
well-known Alatli prof. who has a reputation for not passing anybody ex
cept his acquaintances. on the street. Unable to bear any mor< of such be
havior, we left. Our sensibilities were outraged. IVc think it high time that 
such actions be stopped* on this campus and wish to rccommcnd that the 
instigators of any similar activities in the future be brought before the 
Student Board of Discipline and may Justice take its course! If there be a 
Justice, let it be known!*****~*****
The Arts Ball will be held before this strip is written again. (Maybe 
lots more will happen before this strip is written again!) As you will per
haps have noticed in adjacent strips, all Engiricers and Industries students 
have been invited to the Ball. At first it was planned to have it a closed 
affair, but since tlie committee couldnt sell enough tickets to pay .for the 
paints to make the decorations,'it was decided to have open house. The cos
tumes, (which arc required, you Engineers!) will be Boorish in theme, al
though you may add your own embellishments. Those who -cannot obtain a 
suitable costume will please see the Costumo Committee, which is com
posed of Jack Hawning, chairman; Helen Ley. first assistant; A1 Hall 
second.assistant; James Mitchell, third assistant, and Harold Miller, boobie. 
If that committee cant costume you. you shouldnt be shaped like that. (But 
youll justhave to become accostumed to it!)/ **''********
Any time you feel jaded, as you no doubt sometimes 'do, even at Car
negie, and if you be male, or male impersonator, drop around to one of 
the Night School Smokers. They arc held in the Gym, as any other place 
on the campus zuould explode under such pressure.' There is simply no end 
of enjoyment available, at such a party. You will be surprised to sec movies 
that you havent seen since the days <of Pearl White . and William Duncan 
and Elmo Lincoln. If you are lucky, you will stand up front in the food 
line and will receive three sandwiches, ice cream, and milk.. If you arc not 
lucky you ivill stand way back in line, will see Bill Taurialo and Ted Zcnk 
parade past you to food, and will gel perhaps a sandwich and milk. The element of chance makes it extremely interesting. The crowning"event of 
the evening, liowevcr, and the one at which the boys have the most fun, is 
the game called "Lower The Balloons, or "You Break Mine and Ill Break 
Yours. When one, or two, of the balloons is inflated with Water, the game 
is especially good.**********

Fraternity Pledges
Cut throat competition between fraternities was recently displayed 
in tlie pushing season terminating last Saturday. After the smoke and

the following collection of pledges was given for the exclusive printing 
of the Tartan:

whose pedal extremities have been 
damaged.
The admission price will be

purchased from anyone wearing a 
white rose and a top-lofty expres
sion. All the half cents from the 
admission fees will go toward a 
fund for building a Wing on to the 
Activities Building. The function 
of this wing will be to house a 
home for dyspeptic Grill caters. It 
is hoped that .with such a worthy

Ex-Poughkeepsie Resid e n t Accomplishes 
Little in Many Years
Mr. Joseph Leonard Cooke, the 
austere treasurer of Student Councilwas born in Poughkeepsie; New York, 
many, many years ago. So many, in 
fact, that he conveniently forgets 
them. J. Leonards sensatiorial rise 
to fame on the Carnegie campus is 
due, no doubt, to his early training 
as treasurer of the Sekrctary Hawkins 
Club in Poughkeepsie, where Har
vard and Yale row, and Kay Palen 
lives. Judging from Miss Palen, J. 
Leonard should have remained there, 
but maybe tlie Poughkeepsie nurses 
didnt suit him, or was it the beer?
When lie matrikcled at' Carriegic 
those Deltsthe dirty dogspledged 
hiju and .ever sincc, they have held 
safely to the bottom positions in the 
fraternity scholarship ratings. Of 
course, Mr. Cooke is not to blame 
for this because he possesses a mind 
cluttered with figures (hut wait, he 
is not an Arts student.)

Last year J. Leonard was merely 
another Buildernow he is the 
Dragons orator in Student Council, 
the pansy of Delta Tau (he inheri
ted this from Jimmy Ashwell) and 
Rosalind Mitshelen's boss. Luckjr 
boy! Wednesday afternoon he and 
Betty Steele lock the door of the 
Council office and get down to the 
serious business of looking over the 
books? On Monday evenings he cats 
Bill Bryant and George Nease under 
the table at the Dragon carousals 
and on Saturday nightsno one has 
ever been able to find him. *
Last spring Cooke had himself 
elected to Student Council on a no 
graft platform and he has remained 
true to the electorate. He is a 
nowned teetotaler and spends his idle 
hours trying to reform Bob Rinakcr 
from the state of intoxication into 
which Dorric Mather c has placed 
him.
Next year Mr. Cooke will be work
ing, we hope, but his mcmorj-r-wcll, 
it is pretty bad.
Dear Dr. Neelley:
I am a freshman music student and very much in love with 
a junior commercial. I think he loves me but I am not quite 
sure. He stares at me with sort of a mooney look but he 
doesnt say much. His eyes are babyish-blue, and he has the 
nicest red complexion when he blushes. He is a Phi Kap, but 
does that mean anything? They do have good-looking pins, 
though.
I took him to my inter-sority formal so that I would be sure 
and get to the inter-fraternity. He was a very good boy and 
crashed through with an invitation. That was nice of him, dont 
you think? Do you thinic he loves me?
He has asked me for a house-date several times, but I am 
not allowed to take him home because my mother doesnt like 
engineers. What do you think about engineers, especially com
mercials?
His first name is Eddie and everybody calls me Little Eva.
I cancelled our names and it comes out that both of us love 
each other. You knowfriendship, courtship, love and mar
riage. Of course, I forgot to consider the word hate because 
we shall never hate each other.
I am only 17 and this is my first love affair. Do you think 
it will be a happy one? Mother wont tell me what love is, but, 
dear Dr. Neelley, I know that you have had so much experience 
in such affairs, so will you please tell me, what is this . thing 
called love?
Little Eva.
My dear Litlle Eva:
You arc playing your cards well. Inspitc of the fact that your 
boy friend is a member of the Phi Kappa fraternity, he may be nice. 
Besides their pins arc not nearly as nice as some other fraternity pins,  
although harder to get.
However, sincc he is a C. E., lie must be intellectual. Tell your, 
mother that this course maintains such a high standard that only those; 
with a very high mentality rating may enter. You may take him home: 
without worrying.
Eva dear, I have implicit faith in your method of cancelling names.- 
I have always' maintained that love will find a way to assert its omni
potent presence and if the cancellation said love, it must be love. 
Perhaps Blushing Eddie has a reason for his silencc because after 
all /actions speak louder than -words. Give him time and encourage
ment, and his .mooney. look^ may develop into something more serious.
You arc not too y'oung to be really in love. Just last year I had 
a love affair with a fifteen-year-old Schenley High School student, and 
I was convinced that age means very little.
Your mother w'as right in not telling you the meaning of love, and 
I, in spite of-my experience, also refuse to tell you. However, I am sure 
Eddie is the most capable person to really explain to you the intricacies 
of this magic spell.
I am sure youwill both be very happy, and you may always coun*^ 
on me if you need marital advice. I .
. Your pal,
> ' ' 1 . Dr. Neelley.
Dear Dr. Neelley:
I am a Senior Commercial and have been for the last three 
years. Lately, I have been very much bothered by my fellow 
classmates because they think I am handsome and should give 
some of the Maggie Murphs a treat. Now Dr. Neelley', /ou are 
such an old social lion yourself I know you can help me. I 
really want to have a date but I cant believe any girl would go 
out with me. Maybe I am only bashful, but I cant help it if 
Im a Beau Brummel. I have written to several agencies and 
have read all the pamphlets on Love Making in Ten Lessons, 
but Im still uneasy. In addition I can play a saxophone. Now, 
as I said before, Im awfully anxious to have a date-, but Im at 
a loss as to how to go about it. Shall I sweep some lassie off 
her feet, or shall I drop my handkerchief where she might no
tice it and pick it up? Tell me what to do, doctor, and Ill 
never say another harsh word about the math department.
Yours without skirts,
Emory H. Sutch.
Dear Emory:
You donVmind. me-calling you. Emory, do you? You-know'1 I al
ways feel more like giving, advice when I. call my. clients by their first 
names. Your problem is unusual . in that you arc both good looking 
and bashful. Most good looking boys can't make the gfrft; let them 
alone. Look at Koultcr. Zeiglcr for example. Sincc you arc a Commer
cial, your problepi is a little, easier. If I were you, adopt the sar
torial of King George . Follows.. Then, I'd ask Joe Well-Dressed Man 
I-Icrbst as to manner, to adopt. The first thing you need, of course, 
is to accustom yourself to the presence of a lady. If I were you, Id 
pick out . some pretty girJ and hit her over the head with a cold chisel. 
I hen; grab her hand,- and, while she is regaining consciousness, non
chalance will, assert ,itslf..and the rest will be easy. ' I know just-how 
you feel as I. was not. always a social lion, as you so coyly put it.
, . . Your pal,
 Dr. Nccllcy.
