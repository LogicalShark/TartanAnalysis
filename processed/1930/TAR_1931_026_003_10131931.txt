Seriously Speaking
A Column of World News Events 
By NATHAN MILLER
A New Enterprise in the 
Social Sciences
We have become exceedingly 
proficient and audacious of spirit 
in the natural sciences but remain 
timorous and hidebound when it 
comes to a problem of govern
ment, economics or ethics (and we 
are beset with a good measure of 
these latter, God knows). This fact 
has been reiterated to the extent 
that we all believe it thoroughly 
and do nothing about it. The 
field of social science remains 
open territory for the designing 
demagogue, the mediocre student 
and the ilambuoyant crack-brain 
of all denominations.
We have casually entrusted 
democracy with the task of re
solving the tremendous issues 
which our clever engineers and 
captains of industry have laid at 
our doors. The avowed theon' 
being that anyone who can spell 
his letters and read the daily
prints becomes forthwith capable 
of settling the ills of his social 
world. The corner druggist, the 
gabbling barber, the smug capital
istall are supposed to receive 
mysterious enlightenment or sub
conscious whisperings that enable 
them to pierce through these dif
ficulties. Public opinion is sup
posed to emanate or exude from 
a democracy like the issue of the 
therapeutic properties of our or
ganic glands.
The fact of the matter is, of 
course, that Mr. Common Man is 
utterly at sea, is altogether per
plexed, or else rushes into the 
open arms of the first likeable 
chap who promises him balm for 
his wounds or surcease for his 
sorrows. and t h e ambitous 
climber who can adorn a "phrase 
picked up somewhere or who can 
make a sufficiently pleasing mon
key of himself in the public eye 
becomes the leader of his folk, 
ready to pass a law or distribXC.ontinued on Page Four}.___

Educational Revolution To Threaten
Future World With Crucial Crisis
College Will Be Realiza
tion of Fanciest Utopian 
Visions
By Roy L. Grant
Speed! Speed! Speed! At last edu
cation has been sucked into the 
maelstrom of twentieth-century rush 
and tear. College graduates, meeting 
order specifications of being cultured, 
polished and thoroughly educated, arc 
being turned out like Fords out of 
Henrys factories.
Overproduction in education looms 
as the primary cause of the next 
world's crisis; but nevertheless in
numerable suggestions for increased 
speed and efficiency of our present 
educational system continue to ^ be 
ardently offered and blindly put into 
execution. The sum cffcct will prob
ably result, in a few. years, in a 
clogging of our market for college 
graduates and a reccntralization of 
the wealth of the nation into the 
hands of a few executives of the 
big colleges. ,
The radio, sound pictureingcnious mechanical devices, and the ap
plication of radical pedagogical 
theories to the field of learning will 
soon lurch the impending educational 
revolution into a visible world-wide 
movement, That an educational rev
olution is inevitable is upheld by the 
fact that our present conventional 
system has not appreciably changed 
in 200 years. Already the gigantic 
University of Chicago has taken a 
courageous step to break this twocentury death grip by the adoption 
of a Five Year Plana plan 
which bestows absolute freedom upon 
the student, permitting him to at
tend classes when he feels he should, 
and to take examinations when he 
believes lie is capable of passing
them. By such a scheme, it is con
jectured that a genius will snatch his 
degree in four months, while a bright 
student will win his in two years I 
And thus the University of Chi
cago has put the educational revolu
tion under way, and its restless
rumblings are beginning to be heard. 
From Washington comes the report 
that .Congress. has passed a bill to

adopted for use in classes at Car
negie. Two of them are being 
used in the Department of Printing, 
one of them in the Sophomore 
Chemistry Materials Course and one 
in the Freshmen Engineering and 
Industries Chemistry Course.
The two books for use in the 
Department of Printing have been 
recently written by members 
of the teaching staff of Carnegie 
and have appeared in the last few 
weeks. The Department of Educa
tion of the United Typothetae of 
America requested Mr., Walter B. 
Gress, Head Instructor in Typog
raphy, to rewrite a text boolf on 
Hand Composition which had been 
in common use for a number of 
years and was rapidly going out to 
print. This new volume, under the 
Advanced Typography was publish
ed and printed during the summer 
under the direction of Mr. Gresa 
and Mr. Fred J. Hartman of the 
United Typothetae of America, ft 
presents interesting information re
garding the principles of Typogra
phy and their application in the 
composing room. The book is well 
illustrated and has been adapted 
particularly for use in departments 
of printing conducted by vocational 
schools and high schools.
A new text for use in the Survey 
class conducted by the Department 
of Printing has been written by 
David Gustafson, Professor of Print
ing and Head of the Department of 
Printing. It is entitled American 
Printing Industry Bulletin No. 1 
the Importance of the Printing In
dustry: Printing Firms and Plants/' 
and contains information regarding 
the size and importance of the 
graphic-arts industries in the United 
States and the organizations of 
printing firms and plants. It is the 
first of a series of bulletins intended 
to cover important aspects of the 
largest of the small-unit manufac
turing industries in the United 
States. The course in which it is 
being used is probably the first of 
its kind to be organized anywhere 
in tlio English-speaking world, and

EORGIA TECH WAS GREATLY UPSET by 
the stellar ball playing of the seventeen Skibo 
gridders last Saturday, but those of us who have been following'the Plaid team closely will 
agree that they arc equal to every inch of the 
victory, and most deserving of it. From all 
accounts Steffans men played a whale of a good game, both on the offense and the de
fense. Their effective passing game opens the 
opposing defense so that the running attack___functions with a degree of perfection, and as
long as quarterback Ducger pitchcs this tunc in the correct key, 
Carnecie will harvest some more healthy gridiron laurels. 
*****
THE rOTENT FACTS in back of the Plaid victory arc 
mumlcd on the excellent work of the linemen. It is only when 
their duties arc well done that the backs arc able to tote the pigskin to the fore. Sample, Fletcher, and Ducanis, playing in 
the middle of the line, rang the, Southern bells time and again 
for considerable losses. Lib Lewis, a very capable sophomorc at right end, also put in a creditable day for the Tartans. Incidentally, Captain Armcntrout and George Kavcl each rung tip six counters with their usual display of flashy broken field 
running.
AN ASSORTMENT OF MINOR SPORTS will swing into 
action this week by the appearance of swimming, boxing, and 
wrestling candidates with their respective managers. ..All'swim
mers will begin with gym work, following the Wednesday meet
ing in the Trophy Room at 4:30.. Varsity and freshmen candidates for the boxing teams 
should report in the gym some afternoon this week. A few of Coach Scstos men arc well along in their training period now, 
but an abundance of vacancies gives opportunities for many ncwcomcrs. An intramural competition in the ring is being 
planned as a thorough method of elimination for positions on 
the teams.The proposed wrestling team is making preliminary call for 
athletes interested in this sport. Experience is not necessary, 
and much can be gained from the workouts that will be held every Tuesday and Thursday from 4 to 6 p. m. At these times, 
Messrs. Rintclcin and Sommers will be in the gym for in
struction purposes.

CARNEGIES PLEBES AND THE PANTHERS CUBS will scramble on the gridiron next Saturday to decide their annual contest. The Pitt Froshs IS to 0 win over the W. & J. [ yearlings compared with the Plebes 13 to 0 win over the same

Skihos Go Marching Through Georgia
SOUTHERN TEAM 
OUT CLASSED BY 
TARTAN ELEVEN
By John Lowes 
Down in Atlanta last week, 
hopes were high that an old jinx 
was to be broken. Never in foot
ball history had a . Georgia Tech 
eleven been able to stop a Pitts
burgh team, and this year chances 
for revenge looked very good in
deed.
But the Golden Tornado sup
porters had not properly rated the 
ability of Captain Armcntrout and 
his band of sophomores and for
mer second stringers, for the Tar
tans from the Smoky City all but 
laid the Yellow-jackets among the 
proverbial swcctpeas. When the 
old foghorn had scared the .spec
tators out of their wits for the 
final time, it was found that Car
negie had triumphed by the com
fortable score of 13 to nix.
Yellow Jackets Improved 
Coach Bill Alexander, one of 
Americas most outstanding coaches, 
presented a much improved aggre
gation over that which was masacred at the Stadium last fall, 
but even that was not enough to 
stop a determined Tartan clan. 
Georgia Tech was outplayed, in
every department of the game, 
nd at no time threatened the 
laid goal
Especially outstanding was the 
work of the Skibo's line. Half .the 
time the Steffen forwards seemed 
to be in the rival backfield be
fore the ball, and at no time could 
the Southern school make any 
sustained offensive. Sample was
by far the most impressive man 
the team; his playing on the 
defense stopped the Georgia backs 
before they could get started.
Those who know, claim that lie 
played the greatest game of his 
career.
Tartans Drive 78 Yards 
Carnegies first touchdown came 
early in the second period after a 
sustained offensive, begun on the 
Skibo 22-yard stripe. After re
ceiving Flower's punt on his own 
22 and running it back to the 28, 
Ducger broke through the center 
of the line for a first: down on the 
41. Kavel picked up three at left 
guard, and on on the next !play 
Armcntrout, accompanied by per
fect interference, carried the , oval 
to the Georgia 30-yard marker. 
Oi. two plays Kavcl and Ducger 
gained nine yards, and Armentrout made it first down on the 
Yellow Jacket twenty. On a sc
ries of plays, Kavcl, who seemed 
unstoppable, carried the ball to 
the Southerners' three and a half 
yard line 1 as the first quarter 
ended. He then plunged through 
right tackle for the touchdown. 
Sample misled the extra point.
Army .Scores 
The second Plaid touchdown
Shadows of Coming Events
was also the result of a long of
fensive drive, with Armcntrout this 
time bearing the brunt of the at
tack. In the fourth period, Duegcr received a Georgia Tech punt 
the Carnegie 48, and ran it 
back to the Jacket 45 before he 
was run out of bounds by Hart. 
Halfback Kavcl then tore off 
three yards at center, followed by 
Armcntrout with a four yard gain 
at right tackle. On third down, 
the Big Tra,in broke through the 
line for a 17-yard bonus. Shortly 
afterwards, he again got away, 
this time not being stopped until 
he had reached the Georgia Tech 
five-yard chalkmark. He then 
dashed around right end for the 
touchdown. Stewart placed a 
beautiful kick right between the 
uprights and the score stood 13 
to 0.
Carnegies final drive late in the 
game was halted by the gun on 
the Golden Tornados 30 yard 
line.
Fletcher and Forsman, star Ski
bo tackles, were injured in the 
last quarter. Elssaeser replaced
Forsman, but Flctchcr was forced 
to continue, as Coach Steffen was 
hardput for reserves. Flctchcr
finished the last ten minutes of 
play on his nerve alone, and the 
Plaid team was playing with only 
ten men in good condition.
Passes Effective
The entire team played, with the 
same brilliance that they showed 
against the powerful' Washrjcff
eleven the preceding Saturday. 
The attack, however, was much 
more polished, and the recklcss 
passing, which spelled defeat in 
the Prexy contest; was very con
spicuous for its absence. Most of 
Ducger's passing consisted of rifle
shots. over the center of line, 
which were capably handled by 
Stewart, Lewis, Ostrosky and 
Pottf?.
Coach Bill Alexander used 26 
men in trying to stop the Scotch 
onslaught but all to no avail.
SKIBO PLEBES AND 
PANTHER FROSH 
TO MEET IN BOWL
Teams Evenly Matched As 
Plebes Play Final Home 
Game
The Carnegie Tcch Plcbc football 
team takes on their old rival, the 
Pitt Freshmen, nCxt Saturday morn
ing in the Bowl. The game will be
gin at ten-thirty.
The game this year promises to be 
very interesting. Last year the two 
teams fought to a scorclcss tic over 
in the Stadium. So far this season 
neither team has been defeated. Both 
teams have defeated the' W. & J. 
frosh. Two weeks ago the Tartan 
Plcbcs downed the W. & J. team 
13-0 and last week the Pitt Frosh 
turned the trick again with a 1S-0 
scorc.
By advance dope the Pitt team is 
unusually strong, and have a fine 
array of backfield talent. Their . two 
half backs are supposed to be ex
cellent ball carriers. But against 
them will be a strong Carnegie line, 
two shifty backs in Terrcbus and 
Spisak, and a hard hitting full back 
in Mihm.
This is the final home game for 
the Plcbcs this year, their remain
ing opponents being West Virginia 
Freshmen at Morgantown, and Iviski 
at Saltsburg.
An open date occurs this Satur
day, giving Wally Steffen two 
weeks to prepare his charges for 
'murderers rowPurdue, Notre 
Dame and Pitt. This trio, along 
with N. Y. U., are rated as three 
of the most powerful elevens in 
the country, and to defeat any one 
of them should be considered as 
giant killing job.
Womens Athletics
The W. A. A. Board elected four 
new members to replace vacancies 
due to'the resignation of the Hockey, 
Socccr, Rifle,  and Archcry man
agers. The new members arc as fol
lows : Hockcy, Alice Thompson; Soc
cer, Kay Wholey; Rifle, Leah 
Voegtly; and Archcry, Caroline 
Schmidt. These new managers will 
assume their duties immediately.'
Soccer
The socccr * game which was 
scheduled to be played off Friday; 
October 9, was again postponed. As 
was the trouble last spring, the 
rainy season is . proving a hindrance 
to all outdoor sports. If all goes 
well, the game between the Red and 
the White teams will be played- the 
latter part of this week.

NIGHT STUDENTS.
NIGHT ENGINEERING 
TO HOLD SMOKER
Not so early this time as on 
previous years for registering. It 
seems queer to start registering a 
whole week late, but they know 
what they are doing at TECH and 
so yours truly signed on the dash
ing line and presto, will be an idle 
might student for another year at 
least. That is provided I am able 
to maintain my classes in a suitable 
manner and with the proviso that 
I fail to flunk all exams, which is 
ps it should be but isnt.
Speaking of registration, well yon 
just have to hand it to those peo
ple for being able to shove the stuff 
at you in one night. First you went 
here and then yon went there and 
at last you. were in a line ready 
for the all important inspection to 
ace if you had complied with all the 
requirementsif you hadn't you had 
better look out for those eagle eyes 
{it the table surely got you. I must 
have [been OK because I didnt come 
flying back' to the preliminary table 
but just went on ahead and finally 
had my pockets touched to the tune 
of a dollar or two for education at 
flight.
It is a good thing the registration 
didnt last more than an evening for 
each student because if it did you 
.would have to supply yourself with 
a carry all or something to hold 
all the dope they handed out. And if 
after signing that mile-long strip 
'"with the color border you didnt con
tract writers cramp, wellyour a bet
ter student than I. I simply had to 
rest up and come up for air. Gee 
Im glad that there werent any wills 
to make out or papers to witness be
cause if there were I simply would 
liave to call in the doctor for an 
examination to determine whether I 
had writitus, tircditus, or some 
such ailment.
And did you see that cute little 
envelope they gave you? I was won
dering what it zuas for when sud'denly I folded my registration card 
and sure enough it fitted perfectly. 
What an idea, and they say that 
CARNEGIE is a Scotch Institution 
>10/ after giving you that little en
velope for your registration card. It 
surely will keep your card clean. 
'Speaking of registration card, I 
guess it would be a good idea to 
carry it with me all the time so as 
'to have it handy when called upon. 
Yes theres another idea, and before 
long I hope to have. more. What's 
the use of going to night school if 
you dont get ideas.
I was out on the first night 
Tuesdayand judging from the num
ber of cars parked and the small 
'available space left to put mine, I 
am sure that the registration is go
ing to be big. Then, too, the crowds 
in the Gymnasium certainly made 
(that big hall look small. The Union
On October 24, the Night Col

New Structure to Connect 
New York and New 
Jersey
When the new George Washing
ton bridge across the Hudson is 
opened on October 24th, New York 
City and Fort Lee, N. J., will be 
basking in the sunlight of the honor 
of being at the opposite ends of 
the longest suspension bridge in 
the world. This structure is the 
latest of a long series of engineer
ing triumphs recently completed by 
enterprising American engineers.
Containing five times the number 
of parallel wires in the main cables 
as compared to the Brooklyn 
bridge, and nearly nine times the 
weight of wire employed in tlv 
construction of the Brooklyn span, 
the George Washington structure 
is by far the most massive example 
of suspension construction ever at
tempted, and will probably be long 
a mark "to shoot at.
Two hundred and ninety-four daj's 
were required for the placing of 
the giant cables which approximated 
56,600,000 pounds in weight. The 
length' of the bridge* represents an 
increase in length of 100 per cent 
over the Delaware river bridge, 
built in 1926. Previously to, 1926 
the increase in length of suspension 
bridges over previous construction 
had amounted to only 12 per cent 
in forty-three years between the 
building of tjhe Brooklyn bridge and 
the completion of the Delaware 
river .project.
These figures evidently belie the 
apprehensions that were felt in the 
early days of suspension construc
tion, and undoubtedly, arc merely 
indications of what is possible in 
the future; When practicable, the

Expensive Pledges
School registration .may not feel'-the effects of the pres
ent financial crisis, but it is quite evident that fraternities 
do expect a decrease in revenue or even a definite loss this 
year. Consequently some of these organizations have of 
their own accord made economy moves to lighten their 
burden.
One of the biggest items of expense to a fraternity 
is the amount spent on\rushing season. One thousand dol
lars or more may be spent by some houses during the two 
weeks allotted to the campaign for pledges. Even when 
times arc normal and perhaps twenty men are secured on 
such an expenditure the investment seems high; but with 
the indications that this year pledges must be fewer in num
ber, such an investment is utter folly!
In nearly every college in this section where rushing 
season has closed already, the number of men joining fraternities has dropped considerably. With no indication'-that 
Carnegie will be an exception' to this rule,, should not some 
steps be taken to prevent fraternities from wasting money 
that they will most certainly need later.
Voluntary reductions in the budgets at some fraternities 
constitute one step that is being taken. A proposed meeting 
of faculty advisers and alu'mni of the fraternities to plan 
budget cuts is another move, There is one big factor pre
venting any great benefit accruing from either of these moves As long as rushing season continues for the full 
two weeks, and competition rcmuns so keen, fraternities 
must invest heavily or lose out completely! When the time 
comes for eliminating a few of the parties and dances and thus taking a chance on losing valuable men, the fraternity 
has no alternative.
Only through shortening the period of rushing consider
ably can the financial burden for each house be lessened. Reducing the allotted time to but one week would give less 
time to encourage expense and at the same time less days l>st from studies. A well-managed program would still 
allow sufficient time for the Creeks tp judge the barbs and 
for the latter to form their opinion.
Considering a change in the dates for rushing season 
in order to obtain'one 'week'that is free from, other events 
there are two weeks1 open. Either the second-week of the proposed season might be retained and rushing begun the 
Monday following the Thanksgiving vacation, or else the week from Saturday, November 1L to the following Sunday 
be substituted. Tlie latter date permits starting on a Saturday and interferes with but one affair, the Freshman-All 
Carnegie dance. Even this need not be considered an inter
ference if a plan could be worked where each fraternity subscribed a flat rate to support of the dance, and the affair 
be held in the Gym. Granting the freshmen free admission would thus permit the Greeks a chance to meet with the 
entire group giving both bodies a chance to consider each 
other by comparison.
Whether or not this last suggestion is of value, the 
problem of revising our rushing program remains. The 
Interfraternity Council can take all necessary action, and the fraternity groups arid advisor)'-, groups should extend 
themselves in order to prevent the imminent spending orgy, 
with its sad hangover written in red ink! K.
Northwestern students proximity to A1 Capones shoot
ing quarters has left its impression, and that .sensible student body thinks no more of Scarf ace Al than it does of 
its own Purple Parrot when it squawks too loudly. Capone 
and henchmen attended the Northwestern-Nebraska football game at Evanston, and when the crowd found this out they 
began to boo. They booed and booedso loudly, in fact, 
that Capone iniagincd the boos were cheers. But his powers 
of perception soon came to his aid and he recognized the 
boos for what they were, .liven Capone isn't made of iron, 
so after an hour or so of intermittent sounds of disapproval from the stands, he and his henchmen left, followed by a 
crowd of four hundred to make his exit a speedier one.
Which all goes to show that even if the police and 
public arc in a continual state of apathy, t^e students eyes arc opened to the state of affairs. Three cheers, Northwestern ! S.
If all the newspapers in the world were wiped out and all the colleges left, there would be very little education. So says Dr. Iienry B. Rathbone, head of the department of 
journalism at New York University. As a matter of fact, education being a process of selective assimilation, neither 
one of the present systems is infallible. It is the student 
who must glean from the pell-mell offerings of both what will most benefit himself. In fact, it is a case of individual 
effort, and even if both colleges and newspapers were erad
icated from the present scheme of things there would still 
be plenty of educated men in the' worldto argue about things just like this. S.
ETA KAPPA NU 
MEETS AT ITHACA
The twenty-seventh annual conven

He is treasurer of Thcta Tan and 
the A. I. E. and a member of 
Kappa Delta Rho, social fraternity.
Members of Eta Kappa Nu arc 
chosen from the junior and senior 
classes in the Electrical Engineering 
Department. Men arc selected who

ENGINEERS SALARIES
The question as to what groups 
in the engineering profession re
ceive the beet salaries is a very 
important. one in educational ccn 
tcrs. Likewise, the comparison of 
the salaries of the engineering 
graduates of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology with the salaries of 
graduates from other engineering 
institutions is very interesting to 
the Carnegie students. But, since 
almost everyone is accustomed to 
express himself on this matter 
without reference to any data, ii 
should be thought very commend
able to offer an 6pinion that is 
supported by objective evidence.
Such an opinion is voiced by 
John D. Beatty in his pamphlet, 
Relation Between an Engineering 
Education and Income. Mr. Beatty 
is secretary of the Bureau of Recom
mendations at C. I. T., and his 
opinion is based on the records of 
the office.
This information show's that the 
average yearly salary of Carnegie 
men for the first ten years out of 
school was higher than the average 
salary of other engineering gradu^- 
ates. Various statistical tables arc 
included in Mr. Beattys report. Iiv 
spcction of these tables show that 
the highest salaries were received 
by the graduates of the Metal 
lurgical, Commercial and Meehan 
ical Departments, and the lowest 
by the Mining and Civil Depart 
incuts. It also shows that the 
total income of Carnegie, engineers 
over a twenty-year period compares 
most favorably with the incomes 
f the members of other profes
sions.
Mr. Beattys contribution to this 
much discussed theme is extremely 
valuable as well as encouraging, 
for it indicates among other .mat? 
(its that only 3, or.'I per. .cent ..of 
the alumni aro presently unem
ployed, while estimates of the.per
centages of the total number of 
unemployed workers in the United 
Slates vary from 10 to 25 per cent.

vation of a minimum number of 
broadcasting channels for the ex
clusive use of educational institu
tions in accordance with a new plan 
of the National Committee on Edu

development is the completion at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology of a glorified "adding ma
chine" which converts brain-tangling 
mathematical problems into beams 
of light, and then, according to Dr. 
T. S. Gray of the Electrical Engine
ering department of the Institute, 
"analyzes the light to find the an

of talking motion picture tests per
formed in Washington during the 
summer will produce on our present 
educational system we cannot fore
tell. Front these tests, which were 
under the auspices of the United 
States Commissioner of Education, 
it was determined that a gain, of 3S 
per- cent in knowledge of a subject 
was registered by children after look
ing once at a sound picture con
cerning the subject. Arc not these 
developments acceptable symptoms 
that our present, educational system 
has reached adolescence and is ex
periencing growing pains? Do they 
not indicate that the basis of future 
education .will not be quality, points,; 
but rather speed and mass produc

There is no end, however, to the 
illuminating predictions that can be 
made appertaining to the devastating 
eruptions that may be brought about 
in our present system within a few 
years.

cal principles. Dr. W. A. Sutton says 
the child of the future will read, 
150 pages as rapidly as he now reads 
20 and yet have a more vivid and 
accurate retention of what he reads." 
Acorcting to this, the future Carnegie 
Student with such a dexterity for 
reading will find himself in one of 
two incredible positions: (1) to com
plete his four year college course in 
approximately seven months, or (2) 
to pursue a four year course and to

Alumnae Reune
The Maggie Murpli alumnae threw a darned nice 
Welcome Reception for the Freshman girls in their 
Recreation Hall last Friday nite. It was the first; 
time that the Rcc Hall has been used for dancing j 
and it proved to have a much cozier atmosphere with 
its floor lamp decoratibns than the Union with its 
cute black girders and atrocious wall designs. Mr. 
and Mrs. Chairman' (Ginny Page and George Purucker) 
made a fashionable late arrival. Ruth Liebcrman 
whispers in the orchestra leaders ear the first thing 
upon her entry. Seen as they passed .through one of 
the lighted spots: Peggy Keenoy, Caroline Eyster,
Mildred Bastian, Dot Yingling, and Rosalind Wilson, 
chicfiy with non-Tech men. Of alumnae who have 
changed their names, Mr. and Mrs. Austraw (Jean 
Roy) and Mr. and .Mrs. Harold (Mrs. Harold is 
president of the Alumnae Association) were among 
those present. Other couples were Queen Betty 
Steele and Prince-Frank Foote, Sally-Hall and Larry
McGuire, Grace Borgcrding and Harry Hower, Alice 
Mae Long and V. McBride, Peg Jackson and R. E. 
Campbell doing spins, Margie Parsons and Harry 
Glover. Hazel Gough, Lu Ross, and a flock of Fresh
men were among the undergrad Maggie Murplis. 
Stohl Libby and partner endangered the lives of all 
present with their high kicking and speed. Everyone 
felt real snooty getting to ride up in the elevator run 
by a uniformed attendant.* *

As an added attraction to .their Plebe trials one 
of the men dorms has each prisoner, take on a -wad

It seems that a few of the Plebes that have not ac

at having to emulate the bovines by cud chcwing and 
complained to the powers that be that the practice 
was not . conducive to a stable condition of the 
stomach. Sid Krasik, hauled'on the carpet by the 
powers, explained that it was an ancient custom, in 
fact, a tradition. Sid had to take to cover tho when 
he encountered the retort; Surely it isnt one of our 
NOBLER traditions. No, perhaps not.* if if if

worlds most eminent sociologists, 
economists, jurists and historians 
which is now taking shape as The 
Encyclopaedia of the Social Sci
ences. Uultimately this work will 
comprise fifteen volumes. Tive 
have already appeared, carrying 
the topics through the letter E. 
Before it is completed (which will 
take three more years), these vol
umes will have been compiled at 
a' cost of over one million dollars.
These facts- are not intended to 
impress in the typical American 
manner of boasting of the size of 
the population of ones town and 
the like, but are intended to ac
quaint those who are not familiar 
with the project, with the magni
tude and sincerity of the effort. 
Picking a volume at random, we 
find: such topics as the following 
treated-, each by a notable ex
pert: Brokers Loans; Brook
Farm; Bubbles, Speculative; Bud
dhism; Building Relations; Bureau
cracy; Business Cycles; By-Law; 
Cabinet; Calvinism; Cannibalism; 
Canon Law; Capital Punishment, 
etc. , Complete bibliographies are 
appended for the benefit of those 
who wish to /pursue their particular 
interest further.
It is not to be presumed that 
this particular venture offers a 
Way out of the lamentable state 
mentioned above'but it does rep
resent one of the first efforts to 
grow out of the pernicious obscur-. 
antism and amateurish fiddling 
while Rome burns, which damns 
our social thinking today.
