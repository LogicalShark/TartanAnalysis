the Freiburg Passion Play at the 
Syria Mosque will be limited to 
six nights and two matinees, run

operation of 725 churches of Pitts
burgh and surrounding territory is 
making possible the coming of the 
Freiburg Passion Play, direct from 
Freiburg, Germany, on its first 
American tour. This play, the 
worlds oldest, beginning in 1264, 
was started to increase religious 
interest in the church through a 
dramatic interpretation of the last 
seven days of Christs life on earth, 
and has grown through the cen
turies from a small beginning to 
a large cast of characters and a 
complete setting of scenery and 
equipment, according to Fred J. 
Ilardistv, who is director of local 
activities arranging' for the coming 
of the play.
Adolf Fassnacht, heading this 
c:tst of famed players who inherit 
their roles and arc trained from 
childhood, is the seventh genera
tion of his family to interpret the 
Christus role. He was born while 
his parents were on a Passion Play 
pilgrimage of Europe and first ap
peared as the Babe in the Manger, 
then a? the 12-year-old Christ, 
teaching in the Temple. He fol
lowed in the role of St. John, and 
upon the death of liis father, he 
play.cd the role that is the ambi
tion of the children of this family. 
With Mr. Fassnacht arc his wife 
and daughter, as Mary the Mother 
and Mary Magdalena, together with
large caxjt of original players.

STUDENTS REPORT 
ELECTION RETURNS
The Bureau of Recommendations 
has met with considerable success 
recently^in the matter of part time 
employment for students. In addi
tion to the regular type of odd 
jobs which come in, several un
usual opportunities offered them
selves in the past few weeks.
The recent .election provided an 
evenings employment to about 240 
students, and a full days employ
ment to 13 night students, which 
netted total earnings of over $500. 
This large order came from the 
Pittsburgh Press, which used the 
students to report the votes from 
the various polling places. The 
students co-operated well with the 
paper, as a letter to Miss Merrill, 
from the Press officials indicates, 
in which they state that they "only 
hope that the results were as satis
factory to you and the students as 
they were to us. The system 
worked beautifully. At least to 
such an extent that we were able 
to score scoops on the other pa
pers, and that was the idea of the 
whole thing. \
Plebe, Beware Of Being The Fattened 
Calf In The Approaching Slaughter
Pietiesa fraternity is an organ
ization that 'annuallyby hook or 
by crookpledges as many of your 
unsuspecting kind as possible. It 
docs this by hook during rushing 
season, and by crook all the rest 
of the time. So beware of the 
wily upperclassmen with the con
spicuously displayed badges.
Should you acccpt their, invitation 
for a free feed, do not judge their 
rating by the quality of food served 
you there. Just remember your 
Mother Goose and the cruel old 
woman who fed the chicken, only 
to kill and eat it later. Their food 
is not ever thus, and had you been 
there a month ago it would have 
been as mush and hash. "And theji 
do say that therc-arc certain mem
bers who live at the house only 
during rushing, seasonfigure o\it 
why yourself). Disdain high-pow
ered rusherstheyre only trying to 
dazzle you into seeing stars (even 
as did Brother Blotto whose pic
ture graces an obscure corncr of 
the dining room). And then pcr-|
haps you will be treated to a 
glimpse of the fraternity scrap
book, where a page is allotted to 
each member, and which Duty and 
Honor compel him to fillagain by 
hook or by crookby the time 
the school lets go of his coat tails 
and shoves him out into the 
world.
Develop a killer handshake, Plcbc, 
and go unmolested.  Also practice 
on the roommate in extricating 
yourself from the bone-crushing 
grip youll soon encounter. Prac
tice a manly boyish grin of pleas
ure even though all the bones in 
your little finger arc mangledfor 
such is the measure of men. Have 
you a Physique? 1 f you would 
fraternize, develop one, for what 
eating-house craves weakling 
pledgesthese pledges who will 
soon be their spring houscclcancrs 
and furniture movers.
For dances it would be better to 
furnish your own date, for the of
fers of chance acquaintances in-.

Not. only the alumni but. the

this campaign for raising money

it is felt that the students will con

Fourth Annual Drive Be
gins With Carnegie 
Day Celebration
Oh Tuesday, .November 25; the 
fourth annual Dollar Day drive will 
commence in connection with the 
celebration of Carnegie Day. At 
this time all alumni and former 
students are given an opportunity 
to contribute one dollar toward the 
Endowment fund. Coming as it 
does on the day that is commem
orated to Andrew Carnegie,.. this 
date takes on an added significance, 
for by this small contribution all 
alumni can materially aid the school 
that was. founded by Carnegie.
The plan for Dollar Day was 
originated by John L. Porter in 
1927. His idea was to raise money 
for the Endowment fund with the 
alumni office acting as sole agent. 
The siim of $600, the amount of 
the. first year's . contributions, will 
total, it has been estimated, $1,608 
in 1946.
It will be well to bear in mind 
the "two for one plan of the 
Endowment fund. Tlie Carnegie 
corporation Ijas made an agreement 
whereby, if the school raises four 
million dollars for endowment by 
1946, the corporation will double 
the amount. This will make the 
total endowment' for Carnegie 
twelve million dollars. Since the 
first agreement a further proposi
tion has been offered,' namely, that
Plaids Primed for 
First Grid Clash 
With Temple
Philadelphians to Present 
Strong Defensive 
Combination
The Plaid gridders will have their 
hands full this week end when they 
tackle the strong Temple outfit at 
Philadelphia. The Quaker City 
lads have the strongest team in 
the annals.of their schools gridiron 
history and are primed for. the 
Carnegie game Saturday, feeling 
that a victory over the. Skibos 
would be a big. help in rounding 
out their list of conquests.
Tlig Temple,outfit already holds 
victories over such strong teams- as 
Bticknell, W. & j. and Lafayette. 
In fact, their record for the season 
stands at seven victories and but 
one defeat. Villanova administered 
the 'only blemish oji the Owls rec
ord when they nosed out an 8-7 
victory.
"Swede", Hansen is heralded .. as 
the big offensive threat in the 
Temple backfield. Tlie flashy half
back is the leading scorer for the 
Cherry and White and many of the 
more prominent sport writers who 
have, seen him inV,action say that 
he would b6 a sure bet for AllAmerican honors if he were on a 
team demanding wider recognition. 
However,-the .Tartan defense is, be
ing primed to stop his sweeping 
runs and the chances are Bonner, 
th.e , Teiyiple fullback, will,, be 
groomed to (lQ#,most of the 'gaining 
against the Skibos. He was the 
big gun in the Owls victory over 
Lafayette last Saturday and proved 
that lie will be a hard man to stop, 
particularly if the field is as mud
dy as - it was for the Lafayette 
game. In piling up a 46-0 margin 
in this game, the Cherry and White 
used forward passes infrequently, 
but when this mode of play was 
employed it was very successful. 
Long gains were made in this man
ner which placed the Owls in scor
ing position several tiriics.,*.
On tlie defense the .Philadelphi
ans arc at their best. In the eight 
games they have played, their goal

The Northern New Jersey Q?n 
is planning to hold a football 
smoker at the, Wilkin's Coffee Shop,
7 WcsV Park Place, Newark, on 
Friday, November 21, at S:.10;p. m. 
As th,is date is the night  before 
the Carnegie^Temple game at 
Philadelphia, Othis affair will afford 
an opportunity -for all who arc 
planning to attend the game to get 
together.
The Wilkins Coffee Shop is easi
ly reached, being in the heart of 
Newark almost opposite the Public 
Service Terminal.
All alumni in. the vicinity are in
vited.
Still pursued by old gentleman' 
jinx, Coach Halferty's cross-coun
try harriers were unablt to stave 
off defeat before the powerful West 
Virginia team at Morgantown last 
Saturday,
The plaid wearers fell before the 
Southern boys^to the tune of 20-35. 
After a somewhat disheartening 
trip, which necessitated the Car
negie men to go without eating 
for six hours, the team arrived, at 
Morgantown only to learn that the 
meet was scheduled for a later 
hour tlian had first been decided 
upon.
Captain Jesse Price, who. was .re
elected captain for next year after 
the meet, was the first Tech man 
to, finish. He was barely beaten 
out for second place and finished 
one feecond later in third place. 
Brand, of West Virginia University, 
garnered first position in the good 
time of 29.54 minutes. Leuphart 
and Robinson of West Virginia 
University, finished second and 
fourth, respectively. Ramsey of 
Ticli, was the next man to gallop 
in, with Heiijeel, .'Boley, Hoult and 
Zimmerman, of YV. Va. U., crossing 
the line , after him. The next five 
men to finish were wearing Skibo's 
colors, Stankcy, Ralph Frank, Krebs, 
Cress and Silvers completing the 
jaunt in the order named. Brown,1 
of. West Virginia . University, 
brought up the rear. Johnny Lo,rd, 
one of Techs consistant winners, 
was forced to drop from the race 
because of an accutc attack of 
cramps when the runners were 
about at tlie half-way mark.
The season has not been as 
successful a it was hoped it would 
be at the first of .the year. Out; of 
live meets, tlie Carnegie boys 
were only able lo be victors once. 
Geneva collegc was the first win
ner over, the Scots on the Geneva 
course. On the following .week,' 
the Tech runners triumphed over 
the Wcstmister harriers on the 
Schcnlcy Park course. New York 
University proved the winners the 
next week oh the same course! Pitt 
reversed the tables this year and 
won the annual city get-together, 
while West Virginia University 
spread rack 'and ruin in-the Jlast 
meet of the season.
Coach Halfcrty was not blessed 
with a wealth oT material this 
year, but with Caplain Price, Lord, 
Stankcy, Worley and Ramsay, left; 
for next year and1 some very promJOHN ALMS
THE GRADUATE MANAGERS OFFICE issued a state
ment some time ago that the gate receipts of the Carncgic-W. 
and J. cncountci: would go toward the relief of the unemployed, 
and now word comes from Temple that similar plans have been 
made for this Saturdays game. The University of Pennsylvania 
has donated the use of Franklin Field where tlie game will be 
played instead of at the Owls new stadium as was originally 
planned.

COACH HOGANS BASKETEERS continue to take vic
tories in their practice games. Last week the cagers added the 
strong Fintex quintette to their growing string of victims. The 
entire scjuad,saw ac.tion in the contest and had little trouble in 
scoring a .'18-25 win. A combination of zone and man-to-man 
defense lits worked exceptionally well in the practice games, 
and it is not unlikely that the* Tartan rofcters will follow one 
of the best teams ever to wear the Plaid.

JESSE PRICE has been re-elected to the captaincy of the 
cross-country team for next year by his running mates. Jesses 
performances throughout the season have placed him among the 
best of all time Carnegie harriers. His best showing was made 
against N. Y. U. over the Schcnlcy Park six-mile course which 
he covered in 28' and 28".
game. The eight -points, Villanova 
scored in defeating the Owls is tlielargest point total any of the Cher
ry and Whites competitors have 
amassed, this season. The .defense 
has been groomed for the past 
few weeks to stop the dashes of 
yth and the plunges of Karcis, 
but since the scouts brought back 
stories of Kayels dashes against 
Pitt the coaches have ,bccn con
centrating on stopping the reverse 
plays which are the Plaid .-half; 
backs specialty.
The Temple team features the 
Penn, style of play, as taught by 
Heine; Miller, former Al ^American 
end at Penn. He has two Penn 
aides, . Bert Bell, , backfield coach, 
and Bob Pike, Freshman mentor. 
The line is handled by John Da 
Grossa of Colgate, ,and one time 
.assistant to Lou Little, at George
town.
The Carnegie team has once 
more resumed hard work .after a 
brief lay-off following the Pitt 
game and the entire squad, with the 
exception of Fletcher, is in fine 
condition for Saturday's game.. The 
knee, injury which. Do^ suffered 
in the N. Y.' U. game is coming 
around very slowly and may keep 
him on the bench the rest of the 
year. Concentrated practice will 
end on Wednesday,' with light 
workouts being held on Thursday 
and . Friday. Tlie team is anxious 
to win this game, for another de
feat would spell a disastrous sc;7* 
son for the Plaid.

STEEL under 
he microscope
Burnished mirror-bright, etchcd in an 
acid-bath, a shiny square of steel is placed 
in the projector microscope in the metal
lography room at Crane laboratories.
To the layman, the j:exture disclosed is 
surprising as the filigree design of magni
fied snowflakes. Sometimes it is like a 
relief map of mountain ranges, sometimes 
like finely veined marble, sometimes like 
tumuitius clouds.
But to the scientist in metals who judges 
it with a connoisseurs eye, the surface 
tells a far wider story. It discloses coarse 
uneven or beautiful-fine grains, tells of 
disproportions and proportions of con
stituents in the alloy, peaks volumes 
concerning malleability, ductility, hard
ness .. . gives a key to action of the metal 
in service, all based upon knowledge of 
the product.
Careful metallographic records of all 
metals used in Crane valves and fittings, 
painstaking microscopic examination of 
all new metals offered for possible use, 
are a part of the check and double check 
and triple check which is routine in Crane 
research and manufacturing.
The full story of Crane application of 
chemistry and science to metals is told in 
a fascinating book,Pioncefingin Science. 
It is a valuable reference book forstudents.

him to govern -without nagging or 
without fraternizing.
Although social activities . do not 
interfere with a sensible students 
.schedule, there arc many who real
ize that a dance or a necking par
ty is preferable to a Math or 
Physics assignment. Sooner or 
later they realize the error of their 
ways and combine their social ac
tivities to a reasonable portion of 
their time, otherwise they arc for
cibly removed from their studies 
by1 the powers that be on the 
grounds of poor acadcmic stand*
jng.
While there, arc schools at pres
ent that are primary interested in 
getting large enrollments with an 
eye- to the large gate receipts, they 
arc fortunately few, and the stand
ard of college work of the remain
ing men and vfomen is as high as in 
any of the past classes. If the pub
lic would realize that, except in a 
few isolated, cases, the officers of a 
respectably appointed college. are 
anxious to ,kecp the standing of 
their institution as impeccable, as 
possible and that the wild affairs 
they read about in the papers usu
ally result in the dismissal of the 
evil doers, they would probably 
have more, respect for the students 
that arc not. to blame.
It has always ,bccn the. ease,, even 
befpre colleges were incorporated, 
that a man's usefulness and respec
tability increased in. a direct ratio 
to his education, and that there 
w.cre always bums who put their 
time iand knowledge to nefarious 
uses. We firmly believe that ah 
accurate survey of campus condi
tions in any college would result in 
finding that the. only thing that is 
even questionable is the total lack 
of regard for a lot of mid-Victori
an conceptions of living and mor
ality, and,/too', they would find that 
on a pro-rated basis, there is less 
> vice and lawlessness among the 
students than there is among any 
other similar heterogeneous body 
to be found in the average "re
spectable" community.
McG.
In a recent statement by -the 
head of a western college, the class 
of people that are usually regard
ed as the coming captains of in
dustry arc right roundly berated 
for their lack of the necossary 
ambition, or perhaps the lack of 
grey matter, required to producc 
original thought.
This feature has been remarked 
by more than a few .business men 
in the past, and if the man was in 
a position to be regarded as a soloh 
or other type of wise head, a brisk 
controversy always resulted. It 
would seem that the general public 
has a mean habit of trying to be
little the collcge man without any 
good reason. It is 'true they do 
have, their escapades, shocking or 
otherwise, but on the- average, we 
would say that they are merely the 
usual run of breezy American citi
zens.
When one stops to consider that 
there arc few, if any, cases of inay.- 
hem, massacre, robbery, or any of 
the other types of ; misdeeds that 
give the precinct inspector the 
creeps charged against college stu
dents, we must say that there is 
not as much cause for comment as 
the general public seems to think. 
We must admit that there are not 
many infant prodigies produced in 
our brain foundries, but we must 
also admit that there are,some of 
the outstanding social lionp, M. C.s 
and orchestra leaders turned out 
every year.
'1 lie social side of college life 
unfortunately plays a more impor
tant part than the pursuits of learn
ing, but while primarily a college 
education is intended to fit a man, 
for his life work, men who have 
the hiring and firing of their com
panys personnel will tell you that 
a wall flower in collcge rarely 
makes a good man to send out to 
meet people, entertain buyers, or 
keep his underlings keyed up to a 
proper respectful pitch that enables

ly opened recently by Phi Mu Alpha 
to secure new songs for the Car
negie Song Book is now in full 
swing. This contest is open to the 
night students on the campus and 
they should make an effort to enter

who could write songs and we would 
he glad to hear from them. The 
rules governing the contcst arc as 
follows:
1. The contcst shall open Tuesday, 
November 4, and elose midnight, De
cember 9.
2. The contcst is open to day and 
night students, and alumni.
3. First prize shall be $50; second 
prize, $25, and fourth and fifth prizes
$5.
4. Songs with verse and .chorus 
shall not be less than forty measures 
or more than sixt}r measures, and 
those with chorus only shall not be 
less than twenty measure or more 
than thirty measures in length.
5. Songs shall be submitted with

For some time there has been a 
movement on foot to change, the 
numbering system employed in desig
nating the rooms in the Collcgc of 
Industries. At last this task has been 
completed and the new numbers- ap
pear now on the rooms. The old sys
tem was entirely inadequate and it 
caused no end of confusion. The big 
pastime in Industries, at night at 
least, was trying to find your class 
room. It was just like Topsy, it 
grew up, but there was no thought 
as, to how it. grew. When new rooms 
were.added a ncjv number was as
signed. Consequently if you tried to 
locate say room 264, your first bet 
was to look for room 263, but room 
263 was nowhere to be found, it 
didn't exist. Now this is all changed.'
During the summer a force was 
at , work rc-dcsignating the room's 
and numbers until now it is a very 
easy problem to find your room if 
you can get the key. To help the 
students along there arc several 
charts hanging on the walls of the 
corridors and if you arc in doubt 
just consult the chart and you will 
be able to locate your room with 
ease.

Would you believe ityesI do Ury 
to study, but what is a poor idle 
student going to fio when there arc 
no books to be had anywhere. Books 
everywhere, but not one to be found 
which you can use. Everybody seems 
to want the same book, or at least 
that is >vhat it seems like when you 
go to the book store and try to buy 
the book which the prof. assigns 
for the course. Wouldnt it be a fine 
idea to publish a menu of the books 
that are on salc^and when they are 
all eaten up, just write along the 
side of the list OUT, to be re
plenished later. This would save time 
when you arc waiting in line for the 
said book.
The library seems to be suffering 
from the same ailment. Try as you 
will any book which you need, and 
you ccrtainly need it at night when 
there) is an assignment made, is out.

First Social Function of 
the Combined Night 
Colleges
The officers clectcd to represent 
the Night .College of Fine Arts in 
the. Night Student Council are all 
night students who possess un
usual qualities. They have had 
long experience on the camps and

work of the College,* as well as 
that of the Night Student Council.

Mauro, president; Mr. James I. 
Lcmdeckcr, vice president; Mr. 
Martin B. Hudalc, secretary, and 
Mr. Wilbur J. Fitzgerald, treasurer.
Mr. Mauro has spent six years 
on the campus and for the past 
four years has aided the Council 
in every project which it has at
tempted. He was vice president of 
lijs collcge last year and secretary 
of the Night Student . Council, 
which position lie filled in a very 
capable manner. In addition lie 
has been the author and designer 
of all the. sketches which have been 
used for the decorative work of the 
Council. These were designed and 
executed with a skill which only a 
true artist possesses. His work as 
night editor of the Thistle also' 
deserves considerable praise, as he 
has made this section the most 
outstanding one the Council, has 
ever had. He served on the Social 
Committee and his work was great
ly responsible for tlie success of 
the Washington's Birthday dancc. 
He is registered in the P. and D. 
Department, and is now in the ad
vanced life class. He - is a mem
ber of Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity.

and the Night College of . Fine 
Arts danccs were aided in every 
way by his work. He is a member 
of the Nu Sigma Alpha fraternity.
Mr. Hudalc, also a six year man, 
is registered in the Architectural 
Department, and lie is a most ac
tive and willing worker. He has 
been a member of the Social Com
mittee for the past two years and 
has aided the Council in 'its work 
in every way possible. In addi
tion, lie has been on the night 
sales staff of the Carnegie Puppet. 
Nothing ha^ been too much for
On November 28 the Night Stu
dent Council will hold its first social 
function of the collcge year 1930-31. 
The Council used the Mens Gym
nasium last year for the first time 
for these functions and' the spacious
ness of the auditorium afforded the. 
necessary space which was denied1 b}' 
the use of tljc Union.
Each year the Council Dances have 
grown until now they arc the out
standing functions on the Campus 
at night. The Committee in charge of 
the affair is working up a program 
and wc expect to have full details 
for publication in next peeks issue 
of the Plaid.
As usual the price of admission is 
$1.00 per couple and if you have 
ever attended one of the affairs you 
will certainly have to admit that you 
get your moneys .worth. Tickets re 
now on siilc and you should see 
one of these night students and get 
yours. They arc working to serve 
you, and you can show your ap-. 
predation by make the necessary 
purchase of the ticket. 
The dance is held during the 
Thanksgiving Reccss period and is 
so arranged that it docs not interfere 
with your. studies. You better make 
your date for this affair right now.
The FAVORITE

Dartmouth man
IF you want to know the Dart
mouth man's favorite tobacco 
watch him as he loads his pipe be
tween classes in front of Dart

strolls along Wheeloclc Street and 
pulls the familiar blue tin of Edgeworth out of his pocket.
A pipe and Edgeworth-this ia 
the smoking combination that has 
won the college man. Harvard, 
Cornell, Michigan, Stanford, Illi

Natural merit has made Edgeworth 
the favorite srooking tobacco in

SMOKING TOBACCO
G. E. Marchand, of the National 
University Society, rcccntly remarked 
that the present wave of unemploy
ment would result in increased num
bers of registrants at the various 
institutions of learning throughout the 
country.
With this thought ,tn mind, it is 
really gratifying to .think that .Car
negie is never troubled with small 
registrations, Republican prosperity or 
no. In fact, ever since the organiza
tion of the Night .School, there has 
been a large turnout every year, 
and the men and women who took 
part in the activities of the Night 
School realized the need for selfimprovement without the spur of 
hard times."
This thought should be , gratifying 
to those who sometimes think that 
their efforts are fruitless? for they 
should realize from Mr. Marchands 
statement that education is generally 
regarded as the key to successful 
undertakings. And, besides, wc 
shouldn't .forget that realizing one's 
own weaknesses is half the battle of 
overcoming them.
Most of us started at Carnegie
because wc wanted to increase our
earning,'power by studying newer 
and better ways of doing, our old job, 
or simply .for the personal gratifica
tion of being able to say that wc
knew more than the average person, 
and that we would probably he
'better .fitted for our position than the 
less educated man or woman. And 
when one stops to consider that by 
starting voluntarily wc have any
where from one to fifteen years start 
on the rivals who .arc starting under 
pressure, wc can lean back and emit
At the last Smoker, held by the 
Night Collcgc of Industries the night 
students had the pleasure . of hear
ing the world famous, at least as far 
as these United States arc conccrncd, 
band of Carnegie Tech. This group 
of students is ccrtainly a wonderful 
organization. They seem to be ani
mated with one spirit and aim, that 
is scrvicc.
They were in attendance at the 
.Carnegie Tech-Western Reserve Foot
ball game at Cleveland, and as soon 
as. the game was over they left for 
Pittsburgh in order to be on hand 
to help the Night Collcgc of Indus
tries entertain at its Smoker. All 
those who were there, and if you 
were not you missed one grand af: 
fair, know what a splendid spirit 
they displayed, Nothing was too much 
for them to do in the way pf play
ing, and could .they playwell, just 
listen to them some time.
The night student body of Indus
tries is indebted to these musicians, 
and .it behoves t;s ,to do, something 
to jjnowt our appreciation for the 
wonderful work they have done for 
us, not to. mention anything about the 
work, they arc doing for the whole 
school.
This convenient supply room is 
such a big help that it would seem 
that .there is some honorable mention 
due to the operations of this room. 
The gentlemen in chargc are always 
ready to fill our orders promptly 
and courteously and upon this con
sideration wc should do everything 
possible to show our appreciation by 
giving them all the assistance wc can.
him to do. He is a member of 
Nu Sigma Alpha fraternity.
Mr. Fitzgerald has spent five 
years on the campus and is regis
tered in the P. and D. Department. 
At the present time he is studying 
special design work. Like the 
other three workers of his college,, 
he is always ready to help the 
Council to succeed. He was a mem
ber of last years Social Committee, 
and anybody who attended the Car
toon dance last year knows what a 
successful affair it, was. Mr. Fitzger
ald, affectionately known as Buzz, 
was the author of these Cartoons. 
He was also a member of the night 
sales staff of the Carnegie Puppet, 
and as a salesman he ccrtainly 
lcftva mark for others to aspire to. 
He is a member of Nu Sigma 
Alpha Fraternity.
The first function of the Night 
College of Fine Arts will be a 
dance which is scheduled to be held 
on December 6. The dance will be 
held in the Union, and promises to 
be a successful affair, especially 
since it is sponsored by the four 
night students, of the ealiber out
lined above* More details of this 
affair will be published in the next 
issue.

A Word to Freshmen
Concerning rushing and its companion subject, pledging, 
much has been said from year to year. It-has been discussed 
and debated so often that there seems to be no new angle from 
which we can attack it. Greeks . have, spoken : their-opinions, 
Barbs have given vent to theirs, and impartial participants have 
tried to make peace between them. To anyone who has been at 
Carnegie for more than one year all .of this is .old stuff. They 
can no longer even feign interest in hearing it repeated. In 
spite of the well-informed majority, however, 'we feel  that 
the new-comers who are the ones most intima-tely . concerned 
deserve a summary of the, situation..
In beginning we might say that: no one disputes, the right 
of the freshman to ignore rushing. His reasons^ for. doing so 
are usually sound, and the original choice lies entirely with him. 
He will never be happy in an' association which carries with it 
financial responsibilities that are too great for him or one that 
he feels has no reason for existence. He must, however, have 
clear in his mind his'opinion on the subject before taking action 
in either direction.
The person' to whom this editorial is primarily'directed is 
the one who has a desire to affiliate himself with a fraternity. 
He must school himself in the beginning ginst the glamour 
that is connected with that X,NVo9O at most prpratory schools. 
YVe do not deny the worth of such organizations, the pleasure 
that can be derived from the contra,desliij) they offer, or the 
mutual benefit that members often offer each other, but. we do 
denounce as the rankest folly joining such' an organization 
purely for the purpose of being knowiv as ' a fraternity man. 
The reason must obviously be more profbund: than that. It is 
i matter of deciding that these nien,3rour'.fraternity brothers, 
are the ones whom you wish to make your intimates during 
your stay at Carnegie. They must be men whose conduct, 
:bllectivel.y. is such that you are willing to be known as. their 
associates'. Do not 'be blinded by the 'achievements o seniors 
:hat belong to the organization as With these men /you will have 
inly brief contact. It is to the sOphmorcs and juniors that you 
must look. Consider their potentialities ratlier than the ac
complishments of the older group. Nor should you be blinded 
by the national reputation of the organization. This may be 
such that it either under or over estimates the.calibre of the 
local group.
Caution should be the key note of your choice. It is diffi
cult, but not overly so, to recognize a group .with which you 
will be compatible. Be positive that you sec this quality before 
accepting a bid, and do not take one that is offered to you un
loss it is your first choice. Uncertainity can result only in, mis
fortune and unpleasantness for both you and the fraternity in 
consideration.
Wear Your Tag
Tomorrow or the day after blue and .silver tags will be put 
on sale, and it should be plainly , understood that; these arc no 
ordinary blue and silver tags or buttons. They are being offer
ed for sale by the Student Council in order that the student 
body can have its own special way of celebrating the .twentyfifth anniversary of their school.
The fund to which the receipts will,go needs no publicity. 
A Student Activities building should by now be recognized as 
a necessity by everyone. Surely this important anniversary 
could be commemorated by no more appropriate gift than a con
tribution to such a fund.
Remember that to be, seen without a button will be to be 
scorned, by your fellow students. -

Hello Folks!
"With Colonel Mueller and Captain 
Ware giving their speeches -without 
a flaw, the Military Ball of 1930 
proved to be an unexpected success 
If the boys hadn't dipped the par
affin cups inf-the punch and if the 
officers boots had arrived, fr.om the 
factory, everything would have been 
perfect. Lack of boots, however, 
meant lack of spurs, happily.
The newspapers took almost all 
possible views of the Honorary 
Officers. Finger prints were about 
the- only classification they missed. 
The new commanders arc Betty 
Steele, Ida May Campbell, Dorrie 
Mather, Gertrude Young, Nan Sloan, 
Kay Palen, Martha Lou Clarke, 
Carol Reese and Peg Kunkle. The 
soldiers can ccrtainly pick em!
Chairman Ben Stepaniok arrived 
about an hour late, with the secret 
as to tlie whereabouts of the pro 
grams. Tux cuffs p ovided programs 
until then. Committeeman Bert Pounce y came without goggles. Former 
Colonel IVorland and 'Ex-Honorary 
Colonel Icky Sheppard lent ' the 
traditional touch to the affair. Ed 
McCloskcy arrived in a Pierce-Ar
row i that couldnt possibly have be
longed to Kissel-Skiics.
Joe (Himself) Cooke must hav.c 
put saddle-soap on the bottoms as 
well as the tops of his boots, or 
else he felt tremendously elated when 
called .to Scabbard and Blade, as his 
little two-stcf) in the midst of a 
dignified march, surprised onlookers 
greatly. Dave Center carried three 
extra medals for having been half
shot three times.
Harry Kolb pulled a quarter-back 
sneak, coming from under the ropes 
for the - Scabbard, and Blade call. 
Frank Foote was present (on a 
free ticket)., without bells  or horns 
of any kind.
Like the Army of Occupation will 
the horde of fraternity salesmen de
scend. upon the startled and be
wildered Plebes next Saturday mprning to inaugurate, another rushing 
season. Before the .freshmen can 
realize whats happening, they s..will 
have promised to attend a lunch, , two 
dinners, and three dances on almost 
any night.
Two quick changes in a short two 
weeks will take place in the Plebe's. 
life. From the doubtful status of a 
Plcbc he will become on Saturday 
morning at 9:30 the most sought\after man on the campus. For two 
weeks he will reign supreme. Iben, 
at the end of the season, lie will be
come a pledge. Why say more?
Thursday will mark the ' beginning 
of the sale of tags for tlie benefit of 
ihc Carnegie Endowment Fund. The 
tags may be bought from any of the 
pretty salesgirls in heather sweaters 
and red skirts. Anyone who doesn't 
puy a tag can't come back as an 
alumnus -and* enjoy the eight mil
lion with a free conscience.
Oakland policemen once more shoived what sleuths they are zulieji they 
took . everybody except those zoho 
lucre doing the damage to the lock
up before the Pill game. The boys 
zvho were doing lab refjorts and 
those :'i bed or under showers seem
ed to be the particular criminals. 
The fad that three milk bottles found 
tlieir marks and that two firemen, 
spent the night in Seobell basement 
appeased the cclcbrators s6mcwliat.
The cops'"got. the last word, how
ever, as theyve \)een distributing $10 
tags along Woodlawn ever since the 
melee, on the cars without parking 
lights. The boys ought to keep the 
tags for souvenirs.
Lost and Found Department
Lost: One hat, size seven, brown 
felt, probably in Beanery Thursday 
noon. Initials: W. R. L. Finder may 
recover his own slightly inferior hat 
in' exchange for the above by calling 
at the Tartan office Frida}' afternoon.
Lost: One Cwen pin, belonging to 
Kay Wholey. Anyway, she claims 
she lost it. Finder will be rewarded 
by meeting Miss Wholcv. Call' Ma

Splinters * * *
Our Printing students are going 
to be journeymen printers, -if they 
keep going to Travelers Inn . . . 
All are not athletes who belong to 
the Twelfth Ward Athletic Club . .'. 
Three more cops hit  the campus last

The Village of Fraternal AmourThis particular article is address
ed solely to you fortunate ones who 
expect to attend the Temple game 
this Saturday. As a frcqticnt visi
tor to the Village of Fraternal 
Amour, we have a fc.w suggestions 
for the neophyte who has never 
set foot on Philadelphia soil.
One of the most dominating in
fluences there is the Pennsylvania 
Railroad. Youll probably take it 
anyway, but if you dont by all 
means take ' a look at the new 
Broad street Suburban Station. Its 
the hugest and most amazing raildoublc houses, and even mansions 
arc often built with a mirror image 
of themselves smack up to their 
walls.
If youre musically inclined, wc 
recommend the Philadelphia- Or
chestra Concert at the Academy of 
Music, Broad Street, Saturday 
night, S:20 sharp, and this means 
sharp. La creme dc la creme of 
Philadelphia society patronizes these 
Saturday evening concerts, and in 
the town theres a huge circle of 
people who live and breathe on

points of interest, the most salted, 
probably, being Independence Hall.

STEPPING ! NTO A MODERN WORS.H
It looms up large in their lives
The telephone has a big place in the daily lives 
of most people today, but its place will be even 
bigger tomorrow.
Its importance has been fostered by the work 
of men in all phases of the telephone business 
and no little part has been taken by those en
gaged in selling. They have helped to effect. 
an increase of more than three and a half mil
lion Bell telephones in the last five years. In 
the same period they have been instrumental 
in making the public realize more completely 
the telephones'usefulness. Result: an in
crease from . 49,000,000 calls per day to 
65,000,000.
For men with a leaning toward sales pro
motion, the opportunity is there!
