this ballroom deserving o f its 
name. The ballroom may also be 
transformed into an open air pa
vilion. There are two upper decks, 
the top one being a "starlight 
deck, while the .lower .is a covered

PUPPET ADOPTS 
NEW 15c PRICE
Special Carnival Number 
on Sale Today; Next 
Issue May 24
Starting with the Carnival Num
ber, which is on sale today, the 
Puppet is adopting a new price 
policy - of IS cents a copy for the 
remainder of the school year. Both 
the Carnival Number and the Com
mencement Number, to be issued 
on May 24, will be sold for the 
new price. The reduction of price 
from the customary one of 25 
cents a copy is in keeping with 
general price reduction by many 
of the college comics throughout 
the country.
If sales for the last two issues 
this year show that such a price 
reduction is warranted, in all 
probability the 15-ccnt price will 
be permanently adopted for all of 
next j'cars issues.
The Puppet staff emphasizes that 
the reduction in price 1 does not 
mean a reduction in the size of 
the magazine. The new price is 
being adopted solely as an attempt 
to increase circulation.
This is the first time in several 
years that the Puppet has publish
ed a special issue for the Spring 
Carnival. The issue on sale to
day has many features pertaining 
to the annual gala campus event. 
Of especial interest is the date in
formation blank for dateless co-eds 
as well as a strikingly different 
cover design by the new art editor.

CHANGES MADE 
IN RULES FOR 
SWEEPSTAKES
Buggies in Competition 
For Design Cup Must 
Be Entered in Race
TRACKMEN INELIGIBLE
Finals of Intramural Mushball League May Be 
Part of Carnival
The rules and regulations for the 
Interfraternity Sweepstakes, the de
tails of which will be published at a 
later date, were discussed at a meet
ing of the Interfraternity Council last 
Saturday morning. The rules are, in 
general, the same as those of previous 
years. with the exception of a few 
changes.
To eliminate the possibility of fra
ternities entering pushmcbiles with 
poor racing qualities and an elaborate 
design for. the purpose of winning 
the design cup, the council ruled that 
in order for a buggy to be in com
petition for the design cup it must 
be entered in the race.
Another change in the rules is one 
with reference to eligibility, concern
ing that of men on the track squad. 
The rule for this year is as follows: 
All men who have earned letters in 
track or cross-country or who have 
points toward letters or numerals in 
the above mentioned sports for the 
current season will be ineligible for 
competition. This does not apply to 
men who have earned their letters 
solely in field events or to upper
classmen who have earned their 
numerals, but who have not made any 
points toward their letters.
The finals of this event, which will 
be run off on the morning of the 
Saturday during the Spring Carnival, 
will be prcceeded by the Presidents 
review of the Carnegie R.O.T.C. unit. 
At' this time the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, of which Colonel Fairley will 
act as commander, will again present 
awards to the highest^ ranking officers 
in the unit. A sabre will be presented

Hell Week Proves Amusing For 
Brothers, But Is Hard On Initiates
Silly Pranks, Queer Noises 
Are Major Part of 
Activities
"Hell Week has swooped down 
upon most of the Carnegie frater
nities, and many innocent pledges 
have had to bear the brunt of silly 
pranks provided by amused broth
ers. Its heaps of fun for the 
brothers, but for the initiates. . . ,
* * * *
The Delta Upsilon pledges were 
obliged to issue a funny little 
cuckoo" every time they entered 
the house. To fit his nationality 
one indignant pledge was asked to 
imitate a Yiddish police dog.
Out at the Pi Kappa Alphas 
one group- of pledges became pro
ficient at eating food with stub
bles of broomsticks. They found 
that the most successful method 
of transfering peas to the mouth 
was to first smash them, and then 
convey the clinging pulp to an 
open mcuth held very closely t<? 
the plate.
The pledges of Kappa Delta Rho 
were treated as dogs. In fact, 
they had to bow-wowr on the 
porch each time they entered.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon celebrated 
Hell Week" with a small bon
fire in the backyard. The new 
men were then hurried to the 
scene to put the fire out with 
mouthfuls of water carried from 
the house. (It is important to men
tion that the water was a blended 
solution of pepper, onion juice, 
castor oil, shaving cream and sev
eral kitchen spices.)
Over at Lambda Chi Alpha no 
pledge was permitted to laugh at 
the table. If they did, their pun
ishment was to stand on the chair 
and tweet cuckoo. A rat-trap
ping contest was also conducted 
among the initiates in order to see 
who could catch th<? most rats and 
mice. Since no rat could be caught 
twice, one pledge was given the 
responsibility of burning the dead ones.
Delta Tau Delta spent a very 
quiet initiation week, confining the 
pledgeship obligations to feats of 
wall scrubbing, dusting, andwe 
ask you to believe it  an ac
celerated spurt of evening study!
The Kappa Sigs compelled their 
pledges to enter through the cel
lar. Upon coming upstairs the 
initiates had to bow upon knees to 
and kiss the hand of the House 
Mother. (It is necessary to know 
that Kappa Sigs House Mother 
is a marble statue.)

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MAY 3, 1932.
W. & J. Trackers Here Saturday. 
Varsity Notters Play Hero 
Wednesday and Saturday.
Entries For Inter-Fraternity 
Track Meet Are 
Due This Friday.
WITH A HANDFUL of engagements this week the Tar
tan athletes should continue their onslaught in the track and 
tennis world without a mishap. The opponents ability docs 
not measure up to the Skibo brand, and the experience gained 
can well be used in next weeks battlcB against stronger teams, 
such as Geneva, Pitt, Grove City, and Temple.
As the W. & J. meet of next Saturday draws near it is not 
the fourth victory that is being looked forward to so much as 
the stellar performances of Captain Coulter, Sigmund, Price, 
Ramsay, Schell, Barger, Brindel, Forsman, and Armentrout. 
These men have contributed the heavy scoring to date, and 
their efforts will continue to decide the fate of the five remain
ing meets.******
APRIL SHOWERS, which have the habit of falling in 
May, can cause the postpomncnt of three tennis matches this 
week, and the varsity could still claim an undefeated season. 
Their earnings show an 8 to 0 win over the Dukes together 
with a very probable decision over the W. & J. netmcn in yes
terdays match.
The real test of the season comes with the Pitt match next 
Monday on the Panthers courts. Coach Hoovers chance for 
a victory is worthy of mention in spite of the renowned Jacobs, 
who fills number'onc position with no difficulty for the Blue 
and .Gold.******
CARNEGIE'S TRACK TEAM profited by their ten-hour 
bus ride to Cincinnati, not only in the matter of a seven point 
margin over the Ohio cindcrites, but in the elimination of a 
years doubt that resulted from, a meet between the two col
leges last season. At that time the Skibos defeated the Cin
cinnati team by a very few points, the opponents leaving with 
the idea that they could win with a mile relay and no hammer 
throw event in the meet. This order of events was followed 
on their home field last Saturday, but the Cincinnati trackers 
lost to the Plaid by a greater margin.******
. FAMILIAR FOOTBALL SHADOWS CAST a faint out
line of Carnegies hopes on the gridiron for next fall as twentylive candidates gathered to learn about the- rule changes and 
tq, get the last minute instructions from Head Coach Bob Wad
dell., Final adoption of the new rules has not been accom
plished by the CoachsAssociation and the Rules Committee. 
This fact makes it difficult for definite plans to be made, and 
as a result, a more intensiyc training period will be in order 
next fall.
The major changes in the rules relate to the kickoff, ruling 
of dead ball, and the use of the'hands on the line. The future 
Idckoffs will measure the '.ability of the kicker more than the 
formation of a thundering attack by the receiving team.
The game will lose one of its greatest thrills in limiting the 
activities of a broken field runner. The, new rules state that 
the ball is dead when the runners knees touch the ground.
The defensive linemen probably suffer most from the new 
legislation. They are almost forced to follow a "laisscz fatre 
policy in order to last the game. put.
Trackers Approach Fourth Win As
W. & J. Appears Here Next Sat.
Skibos Repeat Last Years 
Small Margin Win 
Over Cincy
The Carnegie track team will go 
after its fourth successive victory 
of the season this Saturday when 
W. & J. is met in the Bowl. With 
two successful, attempts to their 
-crcdit, the trackers feel confident 
that the first collegiate home meet 
will turn out just as well. Last 
year the Tartans had little or no 
trouble in trimming the Presidents 
and unless W. & J. has a much 
improved team, which seems un
likely, Carnegie should score their 
fourth straight win,
Last Saturday in Cincinnati, Car
negie laid at rest all doubt that 
was still rambling in the hearts of 
the Cincy runners when they de; 
featcd the Ohioians, 69 to 62, in a 
meet that was not as close as the 
score indicates. Despite the run
ning of the relay and the elimina
tion of the hammer throw, one of 
the Plaid's strongest events, the 
Tartans managed to pile up enough 
points to gain the decision.
Captain Coulter was a busy man 
and high scorer of the meet. Tom 
earned IS points as a result of 
firsts in the 440, and high and 
low hurdles. Sigmund ranked .sec
ond as a result of a first in the 
100, and seconds in the 220 -and 
broad jump.
Points mounted so evenly that 
no indication of the winner ap
peared until the last few events. 
Coulters first in the high hurdles 
was followed by a first and second 
in the mile by Ramsay and Allan

Plebe Runners Strive
For Win Over Kiski
Tomorrow the Plebe track team 
journeys to Saltsburg to take on 
the strong Kiski outfit. Kiski has 
always been one of the toughest 
opponents for the Tartan Plebes in 
every sport, and track is no excep
tion. Last year these boys jour
neyed down to Pittsburgh and 
gave the Plebes a decisive deft. 
This year the Tartans expect to 
turn the tables and avenge last 
year's, downfall With Perin to 
take care of the dash events and 
Brown to match strength and skill 
with his opposing weight throwers, 
the chances for the Plebes ' emerg

Tartan Netmen
Beat Dukes, 8-0
Duquesne, Alumni, Pitt On 
This Weeks Card
A high-powered Carnegie tennis 
team opened its season last Wed
nesday with a decisive 8-0 victory 
over the Duqucsnc netmcn. The 
Tartan racquet wicldcrs had the 
situation well in hartd in every 
match, although several players 
were carried into three sets. Six 
singles and two doubles matches 
were played. Everett Groves, Skibo 
No. 1 ace, came through with a 
classy straight set victory.
On Saturday the varsity was 
scheduled to tangle with Grove 
City on foreign soil, but old J. 
Pluvius intervened and the meet 
was postponed.
Wednesday the Plaid racquetmen 
play a return match with the Bluff 
team here, and . on Saturday they 
meet the Alumni in a practice 
match. Monday finds the team en
countering Pitt in the first of the 
annual series; this meet will be 
played on the Pitt courts.
The Plebes also showed class
in winning over the strong Shadyside Academy team by 5-1 margin. 
The Shadyside men were able to 
win but one singles match. A 
match with the Duqucsnc frosh 
scheduled for Wednesday was can
celed due to wet grounds. The
Plebes seem to have another pow
erful combination this year, and 
Coach Hoover is looking forward 
to plenty of wins for his first year 
men.
Wednesday the freshmen take on 
the Duke frosh, and Friday  they 
are scheduled for a return match 
with Mt. Lebanon High school. 
Mt. Lebanon has an unusually 
strong team this season, having 
beaten the Skibo yearlings 6-1 in 
the first meet a week ago. The
poor showing of the Plebes may
be partly blamed on lack of prac
tice, for they had been out only 
one day before the meet. Monday 
they face another tough tarn in 
the Pitt frosh, this match being 
played hre.
Three Close Games 
Mark Second Week 
Of Softball Season
The final games o the first brackct 
in the Intcrmural Mushball league 
were played off last week and several 
interesting contests took place. The 
games between the Scavengers and 
the Beta Sigma Rhos; McGill Hall 
and Delta Sigma Lambda; Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon and Kappa Delta Rho 
were the most exciting as the scoring 
was close throughout the seven in
nings of play.
Monday the Scavengers defeated the 
Beta Sigma Rhos 12-10. Tuesday 
night Rho Darnit Rho and Tau Delta 
Lambda engaged in a close contest, 
Rho Darnit Rho winning by the score 
of 13-7. On the same evening, the 
Theta Xis romped away with Hen
derson Hall by the score of 23-1. 
This game was called at the end of 
the fourth inning because of the 
fifteen run rule. Wednesday night 
the Kappa Sigs had little difficulty 
in trouncing the Delts. The final 
score at the end of four innings was 
18-2. The same evening McGill hall 
defeated Delta Sigma Lambda in a 
thrilling game by the score of 10-9. 
The Phi Kappas started their season 
off in fine style when they downed 
the Pi Kappa Alphas 13-4. In the 
other game on Thursday night the 
K. D. Rs. put up a stiff battle but 
were finally subdued by the strong 
hitting S. A. E. team by the score 
of 10-9.
Much enthusiasm has developed 
from this newly organized sport in 
Carnegie, and there is going to be 
some stiff competition for the cham
pionship trophy. All the winning 
teams play each other within the next 
two weeks. At the end of that time 
some idea of a sure winner will be 
available.

DO YOU INHALE?
Why is this 
vital question so much 
avoided by other cigarettes?
E
VER since Lucky Strike created 
that special process for purify
ing fine tobacco and told the full 
facts about cigarette smoking 
the industry has been in an uproar. 
For Lucky Strike has dared to 
mention things that were con
sidered "taboo in the cigarette 
trade.
You may have noticed a striking 
avoidance generally of the word 
"inhale in cigarette advertising. 
Why? Goodness only knows! 
For everybody inhalesknowingly 
or unknowingly! Every smoker 
breathes in some part of the smoke 
he or she draws out of a cigarette.
Thats why its all-important to be 
certain that your cigarette smoke 
is pure and cleanto be sure you 
dont inhale certain impurities.
Do you inhale? Lucky Strike has 
dared to raise this vital question 
for it gives you the protection 
you want. .. because certain im
purities concealed in even the 
finest, mildest tobacco leaves 
are removed by Luckies famous

that process. Only Luckies have it!

Carl Ludwig to Furnish Music 
For Final Party of Season
With the Inter-Night College dancc 
to be held Saturday evening May 14, 
in the Mens Gymnasium the curtain 
will drop on the most successful so
cial season ever enjoyed by the night 
student body.
That this final affair will be the 
most brilliant of the season is assured 
with the announcement by the com
mittee that they have engaged Carl 
Ludwig to furnish the music for this 
occasion. This group of local mu
sicians' enjoy an enviable reputation 
and arc widely known for their mu
sical ability. This is onty one of 
the many things planned by the social 
committee to make this affair one that 
you will not forget. Several nvcl 
features will be offered in addition 
to the unique decorations that are em
ployed to transform the huge gym
nasium into a brilliant ballroom.
Coming one week after final exams 
and at the close of night school this 
last dance will be the best attended 
party of the year. It furnishes the 
last opportunity of wishing our - fel
low students a happy summer. Tickets 
are now in the hands of the various 
salesmen on the campus and are sell
ing at the usual assessment price of 
one dollar per couple.

THAT, with everybody en
grossed in exams this week, 
peace seems to reign supreme, 
at least outwardly.
THAT, due to the above we 
have entirely forgotten the de

THAT nobody raised a kick 
when the big shots announced 
that next years tuition would 
not be raised as previously 
planned.
THAT Plerr Fritz secmccl to 
be greatly worried as to the 
condition of the campus after 
the curious public had their 
fling on Exhibition Day.
THAT that's that and Ill be 
secnya
The annual spring dancc held by 
Nu Sigma Alpha, the activities hon
orary on the night campus, was a 
big success in every way. Thistle 
Hall seemed to take on an unexplain
able something as the members, guests 
and friends intermingled during the 
dancc program. It may be bccaUse 
of the rythmic music of the orchestra ; 
it may be because of the exquisite 
color of the carnations which were 
presented as favors, red ones to mem
bers as this is the fraternity flower, 
and white ones to guests and friends, 
or it may be the simplicity with 
which the whole affair was carricd 
out; it would be hard to say what 
was the controlling force which made 
the party such a success. The very 
walls of Thistle Hall seemed to be 
animated with the spirit of the 
dancers.
During the evening the fraternity 
made its call to those night students 
whom it wished to honor at this 
time by offering membership for 
faithful - work. The students who 
were callcd for plcdgcship are: A. W.

I have heard that the leopard is 
unable to change his spots, that 
the giraffe is unable to reduce his 
neck, that the ostrich is unable 
to hide his body by burying his 
head, but when it comes to yellow 
horses turning into zebras, well, jrou 
have to hand it to our old nags 
on the campus, for the camouflage. 
I had to wipe my eyes several 
times to make sure I was at Carnegie rather than in Africa. The

A unique collection "of tacks is on 
view in the P and D corridor of the 
Arts School. All who are thrilled 
or fascinated b}r the unusual should 
see it, because many rare specimens 
and unisolatcd spccics of tacks are 
shown. One finds it nccssary to 
whistle some of the highly technical 
names by which various specimens 
arc known. The most unique of all 
, is the Tackus Larvae i Fungii show
ing tacks in the chrysalis stage prior 
to development to tackhood. Hope 
the "Taekusologist who assembled 
this collection wills it to the Car

On May 10 and 11 night students 
in the Department of Drama will pre
sent for one-act plays. The plays 
to be presented arc Drums of 
Oridc, "Joe, "Women Folks," and 
"The, Warriors Husband.At the end of cach semester the 
night students of the Department of 
Drama take part in the casts in order 
to obtain experience which is im
portant in this type of work. The 
plays are given in. the Little Theater 
on the Campus, with all the correct 
stage setting. These students have 
b'ecn taking training and their work 
ranks with the best. Some of the 
most successful students in the day 
group arc former night students who 
have transferred to the day courses.
Talent of any kind needs inspira
tion and this is furnished by means 
of an audience. So if'you desire, to 
see something worthwhile, sccure 
tickets for these four plays at the 
Registrars Office and plan to attend 
the plays on either May 10 or 11.
While visiting Engineering Hall last 
Friday during the exhibition, were 
you fooled by the vanishing lamps 
and singing tubes? I dont under
stand the mystery, but Im convinccd 
that they are a fraud. Ill bet the 
lamp doesnt really vanish. Oh if 
only Houdini were alive today hed 
expose all of those physics profcs-. 
sors.
Wonder how the ticket design 
contest for the football paste
board is progressing. If I were 
an art, student, instead of an en
gineering student, I surely would 
enter ray hat in the ring. It must 
be wonderful to have artistic ability 
I suppose that is what they call 
it when you get an inspiration 
but thin my inspirations come 
from the Math. Dept, at the zero' 
hour, when the august being de
scends with his all powerful wand 
to call me back to earth. Another 
pipe dream shattered when I 
though I had mastered all the 
problems the Math. Dept, had up 
their sleeve.
Never try to pass yourself off as 
an art student if you arc not, when 
crashing a Night Arts dancc, even 
though you have an honest-to-goodncss Night Arts registration card as 
proof. You sec arts students arc 
not very prone to forget the names' 
of their instructors whom they sec 
at least three times a week for over 
seven months, and there is that syr 
chological identification label so ob
vious to any old timer.

To the Members of the Student Body
I wish to express my thanks to all those members of 
the student body who assisted in making the annual ex
hibition a great success. It was one of the most admirable 
demonstrations of the work of the Institute of Technology 
that has ever been held. The visitors were enthusiastic 
about the variety and the excellence of the various items on 
our- program. On all sides I heard enthusiastic comments 
ton the courtesy, the-helpfulness and the friendliness of the 
students. The praise that was given them is well deserved.
The annual exhibition is an important event in our 
calendar and serves to make many friends for the Insti
tute. I am deeply indebted to all those who contributed 
. to the splendid success of the afternoon and evening.

Carnegies Election System
A satisfactory elections system is a major problem in 
any self-governing student body. No standard plan has .yCt 
appeared that completely satisfies the question, as the con
ditions under which the system opcnites differs with every 
school.
The traditional attitude for the average college student 
in regard to student government includes i vague concept 
. of injustice and a lazy disinterest in the outcome. There 
arc bound to be some really concerned and anxious to do 
their share. But there are also bound to be some "gripers 
who disparage the existing order, whether good or bad.
Carnegie has made a splendid advance with her elec
tions in recent years. The persons vitally concerned with 
the government have recognized the improvement. The 
others seem to be losing their distrust and unconcern. 
Student council control has proven reliable. But m'ost note, worthy is the increased interest of the student body. The 
best men arc becoming candidates for offices and their 
classmates arc showing enthusiasm as supporters.
The number of- nominees for the general elections on 
Thursday is the largest in many years'. The pendulum has 
been displaced, from its extreme position, which was char
acterized by disinterest, The change is to a more healthy 
state. Should the pendulum swing beyond the normal and. 
into the furious, ovcr-cmpahsizcd state of polities now dis
rupting many. campuses, Carnegie would be worse, off than 
before. A word of caution is introduced in order to avid 
any future trouble which might destroy the highly satis
factory system now in our hands.
* * * *
Revive the Womens Guild
Before the time of any of Carnegies present under
graduates a certain organization flourished on the campus, 
an organization which had a definite and splendid purpose, 
a purpose which was upheld by a group of eager and en
thusiastic' women. Philanthrophy was the purpose of this 
group, but tliis was something' different than the charit
able intent of many similar collegiate organizations. A 
definite link was established between Carnegie and the out
side world. The members realized that not all life was as 
'sheltered as the one led by a college student. The suffer
ing ad poverty which existed in th reas outside the 
campus were perceived and acknowledged by these women 
who attempted' to partially relieve suffering. Although it 
may seem strange, such a humane cause was the only tan gible connection between Carnegie and other people.
. Out of 'their enthusiasm, the charter group of women 
conceived the idea of building a settlement house some
where off the campus. Through the medium of dances, 
'bazaars, teas, and dinners several hundreds of dollars were 
earned, and. the profits were immediately invested in sound 
securities, After the first fervor had dwindled and sane in
vestigation was made, it was discovered that the undertak
ing of building a settlement house, although a Very excel'lerit and benevolent idea, was too gigantic for these women.
Although' the members werestill. ardent and still of 
noble; intent, their .projects became less and less pretentious, 
keeping up a room in a hospital for one year, furnishing a 
playroom in a local settlement house, supplying milk to a 
poor family for a limited length., of time, and distributing 
Christmas gifts to poor families.
During the current school year a great blow was 
wrought on this organization when, because of conflicting 
elenvents, its only source of revenue was denied. The an
nual tag day was.relinquished for one year at least. And 
with the abandonment of this last medium, the campus 
forgot about the Guild. A meager governing board has 
struggled to placc the organization into-.prominence again 
arid failed miserably to do so;
The Womens Guild should be a vital organization at 
Carnegie, if for no other reason than present necessity in 
the outside world. In this time of need the Guild has 
failed the most'. Two things arc necessary before any at
tempt at action may be taken. New blood must replace the 
present inactive "board; a new purpose must be evolved, 
not necessarily an imposing one but rather an attainable 
one. Complete reorganization must happen in order to 
place this much needed organization into action once more 
and forever. A challenge has been issued. Carnegie women 
must pick up the gauntlet.
