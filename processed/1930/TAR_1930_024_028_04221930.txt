Campus Improvements To Include 
New Field, Grading and Planting
.Many improvements about the 
campus are being undertaken by . Col. 
Fairley and his Department of Build
ings and Grounds, and if all are 
accomplished they will greatly enhance 
the beauty of our campus. Included 
in this improvement program is the 
enlargement of the grounds around 
the boys' dormitories, the develop
ment of the field behind the girls 
dormitories on Woodlawn avenue, the 
planting of several shade trees of 
different variety together with shrub
bery, the cultivation of permanent 
grass along the Cut, the construction 
of steps and sidewalks around the 
. Cement Shed in the rear of Engineer
ing Hall, and the installation of new 
windows in the Mining Laboratory in 
Engineering Hall which will greatly 
improve the lighting in that lab.
Some difficulty has been experi
enced in the cultivation of a lawn on 
.the Cut along Forbes street and Col.
Fairley asks the co-operation of the 
students by keeping off the grass 
freshly planted parts until a good 
turf is. developed when trampling
will not harm it.
This department has been working 
for nearly three years on that ground 
behind the girls dormitories which 
they intend to develop into a large 
playing field for both boys and girls 
dormitories along Woodlawn avenue. 
Before it was filled, this section, 
which is being graded at the present, 
was r. large hole from thirty to forty 
feet deep. After several years time 
to allow the dirt, to settle, it is hoped 
that this field "for outdoor games
will be ready for the use by next 
fall. This field "will eliminate the
necessity of using Woodlawn avenue 
for playing ball when a springtime 
whim seizes the boys in the dormitor
ies, as has been the case this year.

Plans for County 
Fair Being Formed 
By Robert Wright
Preparations for the County Fair 
are progressing rapidly under the 
direction of the lommiltee chairman, 
Robert Wright. Letters have been 
sent out to the presidents of the 
various sororities,, fraternities, and 
dormitories inviting them to par
ticipate in the affair.
As tentative .plans now stand, the 
county fair will probably take up 
the greater part of the afternoon, 
It is hoped that it will be possible 
to run several side shows, in addi
tion to the main show, which will 
consist of vaudeville offerings and 
skits. The booths a.id tents will be 
erected in the bowl, which provides 
an ideal situation for an affair of 
this kind. In case of rain the gym 
will be utilized.
The organizations who are planning 
to take part are urged to send in 
the application blanks immediately in 
order that the committee may se
cure the needed equipment'.
In a pre-season meet staged at the 
boWl Saturday, the winged head war
riors of the Pittsburgh Athletic Asso
ciation took the measure of the com
bined Carnegie Varsity and Fresh
men sprint stars to the tunc of 71-45. 
The Tartan squad was severely handi
capped by the absence of many of 
the varsity mainstays who were out 
of town during the Easter vacation 
period.
Easily the outstanding star of the 
meet was Work, a^ former Purdue 
luminarj', who captured three first 
places for the invaders. Close on his 
Schnelbach with victories in the 100 
heels for scoring honors was 
and 220. Merten, the Plaids Cap
tain, was high scorer for his club, 
capturing the broad jump, and finish
ing second in his specialty, the pole 
vault, as well as capturing second in 
the high jump. The only other 
Plaid trackman to win his .event was 
Coulter who gapturcd h'is event the 
quarter in eas}' fashion.
In the track events the Plebes 
showed signs of strength, with 
Howcr capturing second in the i00 
and 220, being lead to the tape in 
both events by Schnelbach, former 
Duquesne University flash, and pres
ent . champion. of the Allcgehany' 
Alountain Association of the A. A. U, 
Coulter, rangy Plebe quarter milcr, 
came within four-tenths of a second 
of the track' record In the 440 when 
after trailing Roy until they rounded 
the final curve, he finished with a 
rush and easily outdistanced-the field. 
Ramsey,' while only capturing a third 
in the mile, made the fast time of 
4:47 which should win many firsts 
for the freshman club iii their com
ing dual meets.
One of the closest races staged on 
the cinder path in the bowl for many 
a moon was the half mile event. 
During the race five different men 
held the lead for a brief period, 
with the closing stages becoming a 
duel between Newton, P. A. A. star, 
and Magnuson varsity luminary, the 
former gaining the verdict by a 
strong sprint in the last few yards.

Psychrometry and Air 
Conditioning Will 
Be Subject
"Psychrometry and Its Application 
to the Industrial Use of Air will be 
William H. Carriers subject, when 
he speaks in Carnegie -Union, April 
30 at 8:30 p. m.
Air conditioning started as all in
dustryin 1902. In that-year .a man 
in New York engaged in the color 
proccss business, asked the Buffalo 
Forge .Company why he was having 
so much trouble with his colors. The 
Buffalo Company, assigned Mr. Car
rier to solve the problem. He found 
that air humidity was the answer.
Working both on the drafting board 
and in the machine shop, lie was 
able to manufacture . weather. As 
soon as lie secured sufficient capital, 
he formed the Carrier Engineering 
Corporation which has -grown until 
now it is valued at something over 
100 million dollars.
Manufactured weather benefits 
many industries. Without ' manu
factured weather there would be no 
rayon. Tobacco would be' sggy and 
poorly cured. The movie industry 
would be troubled by atmospheric 
conditions. The powder, flour, baking, 
and candy industries would be great
ly hampered and restricted.
Mr. Carrier, who brought about 
this industry, was born November 
26, 1897, at Angola, New York. He 
had to struggle to , t an education, 
and taught school while preparing 
for college. Having . secured a 
scholarship to Cornell University, he 
was able to go through, graduating 
with honors in Mechanical Engineer
ing. He is an internationally known

Omega was shown as having a 
ratio of 2.26 in.the first semester 
scholastic standing of the fra
ternities. This was an error and 
should have read 3.26, thus plac

are now at work preparing it for 
the printer. Among the many fea
tures of this years book wrtl be 
the prodigous grecn-inlc sketches 
of the- campus, the gorgeous purple-hucd cover, an augmented Night 
section, a large athletic division, 
and a large number of photographs 
of the fraternities, the band, the 
football and basketball teams, and 
other organizations.
The flaring green-ink sketches of

Carnegie Annual Exhibition Night
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
will hold its annual exhibition on 
Friday night, April 25. The event 
is witnessed each Spring by be
tween 15,000 and 20,000 persons.
Several unusual features have 
been planned for this years "open 
house. The masonry shop in In
dustries Building will be attractively 
planned. The furnished bungalow 
of p^st years will be replaced by 
a village square containing four 
structures, all built by students in 
building construction. In .the base
ment of Machinery Hall a wind 
tunnel will be in operation where 
model aircraft structures may be 
tested. Here steady gales of wind 
up to a velocity of more than 150 
miles an hour can be produced, and 
the effect on different models de
termined. /
Another ilew laboratory, on the 
north side of Engineering Hall, will
be open to the public on exhibi
tion night. In this new addition is 
located the hydraulics ' research 
laboratory. There one may observe 
water flowing over small models o! 
dams. River beds, shore, and dam 
are all worked out to a fixed scale, 
and the flow of water simulates 
that of the stream on which the 
full-sized dam is to be built.
The program of the exhibition is 
scheduled to begin at 6:30 p. m., 
when the R. O. T. C. will present 
a Retreat Parade ' on the campus 
adjoining the Morewood avenue 
entrance. A staff of cadet officers,

Varsity Squad To Open Track SchedL Against Reserve
The varsity truck squad v/ill'forinally open the 1930 campaign when they 
meet the Western Reserve team in a 
dual nice', on the Clevelander .track 
Saturday. Tliia iB the first competi
tion v/ith the Red and White outfit 
.and is another step in the new 
rivalry recently developed v/ith Swim
ming meets and football games. The 
jaunt to Cleveland affords the team 
its only out of town dual meet of 
the season and ,111c boys have been 
training hard in hope of gaining a 
position on the team before the 
Jirsi meet.
The team this year will be com
posed chiefly of vetern material. In 
the sprints, Kennedy looks as good 
as ever, and George Ncasc has been 
turning in some fine times in the 
220 and the quarter after a belated 
start caused by the extended Basket
ball season. Magnuson looks like a 
consistent point scorer in the half 
mile. The mile has a wealth of ma
terial headed by Brown and Schaf
fer. Schaffer was a member of the 
squad last season but tried the sprints 
and hurdles with'little success; since 
changing to the distance events, 
however, lie has become a consistent 
performer in the mile and two mile 
runs. Price is another likely look
ing candidate in the distance events.
The field events arc built around 
Captain Merten who stars in the 
pole vault, high jump, and, broad 
jump. Barger of last year's Plebe 
outfit is another vaultcr of ability, 
while Wilson is far better than 
- average i- the high jump. The weight 
events have always been a weak 
point of the Tartan Track teams in 
the past and the present outlook is 
far from rosy.
Coach Halferty refuses to become 
optomislic over the seasons outlook, 
but although the team meets the 
leading schools in the tri-state dis
trict, there is every reason to be
lieve that the Skibo squad will hold 
their own with the best of them.

Sixty Companies Interview Seniors
Practically All Graduating 
Seniors Have 
Positions
FOX, MAGNUSON
With commencement still two months 
off, two-thirds of the seniors in 
the .College of Engineering and 
Industries at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology have been offered 
positions for the coming year, ac
cording to John D. Beatty, secre
tary of the Bureau of Recommen
dations which secures positions for 
almost all of the graduates of 
Carnegie Tech.
To date, the bureau which Mr. 
Beatty runs has arranged more 
, than 1,000 interviews between ctn: ploying companies and prospective 
graduates. Representatives of GO 
companies have visited the Tech 
campus to secure candidates for positions.
The proverbial difficulties of getting a job once the sheepskin had 
; been secured seems a myth to the 
CarliCgic seniors. Of the 181 men 
in the two colleges who are candi
dates for a degree in June, 122 
Jtave definite offers for positions. 
In many cases, one man has re
ceived more than one offer, since 
the /122 students offered placements 
have received 200 blJs.
In three departments, of, the Col
lege of Industries, namely, Heating 
and Ventilating, Printing and In
dustrial Education, every man has 
a definite offer. The 18 seniors in 
the Department of Works Manage
ment have held 158 interviewsTSvith 
personnel representatives, and 16 
of the class have received 42 offers.
The Department of "Electrical 
Engineering has the largest num
ber of seniors. * The 30 candidates 
for degrees in this department have 
been interviewed 182 times, and 
21 of the men have received.,42 
offers, an average of two positions each.
Besides the 60 companies that 
sent representatives to the campus, 
35 other firms have written Mr! 
Beatty asking him to vinform the 
seniors that applications for em
ployment would be accepted by 
mail. Of the 63 men who havt 
not received offers on the campus, 
half are carrying on negotiations 
with these outside firms, Mr. Beatty staled.
"The men from the Civil Engin
eering and Building Construction 
departments make up about half 
of the seniors who have not re
ceived offers of employment. This 
condition is not peculiar to this 
year alone, but is due to the sea
sonal character of the building and 
construction industries; which, ab
sorb most of t lie graduates of 
these two departments. Many of 
these men will be .placed between 
now and the time of graduation," Mr. Beatty said.
"Despite the unemployment situa
tion, openings for our graduates 
are as numerous as in past years. 
It i:, particularly gratifying to the 
institution to feel that industry is 
coming to recognize the value of 
the technically ' trained man. A 
close contact has been built tip be
tween the engineering schools and 
the industrial world, and a con
stant interchange of ideas and 
,problems has enabled the under
graduate to become familiar with 
the principles necessary for suc
cess in industrial life, Air. Beatty continued.
I his year several new companies 
sent representatives to interview 
prospective graduates'. Among these 
were the Air Reduction Sales Com
pany, Grinnell Company, Interna
tional Harvester Company,  Pure 
Oil Company, Shell Petroleum,
Fostoria Glass Company and the
Imperial Paper and Color Corporation.
Among the larger companies that 
regularly seek employes at Car
negie are the General Electric
Company, Bell Telephone Com
pany, Westinghousc Electric and

Plebes Compete In Only Home Meets On Wed. and Sat.
'Dilis week affords cinder path fol
lowers their only opportunities of see
ing the Plebe team in action. The 
first year men meet Schenley High 
on the home cinders Wednesday and 
clash with the Union High outfit on 
Saturday. These are the only home 
attractions on the Plebe card and all 
those who wish to look over, the 
future varsity material, and we have 
it on good authority that .there is 
plenty of it, should drop around to 
these inegts and watch the Frosh per
form.
These home contests are followed 
by meets at Indiana State Teachers 
College, Sliadyside Academy and 
Pitt. The Plebes have one of the 
strongest outfits that ever represented 
the Tartans and are looking for
ward lo an unbeaten season.
The club is particularly strong in 
the track events. Ramsey looks like 
a sure bet in the mile and two mile 
runs. The former Washington High 
lad has been stepping right along 
with the varsity men during the trials 
and much is expected of the diminu
tive bespectacled star. .While 110 one 
seems to hold an edge in the half 
mile event il will be.capably handled 
by some of, the lads who made their 
numerals in cross country. The 
quarter presents a tower of strength 
in Tom Coulter, who can also be 
counted on for his share of the 
points in the broad jump and the 
hurdles. Coulter stands well over the 
six foot mark and makes full use 
of his long legs when traveling 
around the track. Hower, a high 
school teammate of Coulters, who 
also stands, above the six foot mark 
is being depended on to care for the 
100 and 220. Sigmund, rounds out 
Halfcrty's star assemblage, being a 
timber topper of . U as well as' a 
good 100 yard man. These outstand
ing men are supported by a num
ber of rapidly improving Plebes who 
will undoubtedly come in for their 
share of point scoring.
In the field events the teams 
strength is uncertain, being com
posed for the major part of inex
perienced men, However, the shot 
put is in the hands of a capable per
former when lhe husky Elsasser is 
tossing it. The discus performers arc 
headed by Ed. . Stcntz who also 
showed well on the Basketball court 
for the Plebes, Whitcy Schmidt, 
former Kiski star, is a capable pole 
vaulter and should score heavily for 
the Plaid in the coming meets. The 
only glaring weak spots are the high 
jump and hammer throw and any 
plebe possessing' ability along these 
lines should hasten to make it known 
to Coach Halferty. The club this 
year is unusually Well balanced and 
should conic through the season with 
an 'enviable record.

was in charge of all freshmen ad
missions.
Miss Lawrie, after her graduation 
from M. M. C, C., became associated 
with the registrars office at Car

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT 
(Continued trum Page Une) Because of the constantly passing 
automobilesand pedestrians, we wish 
to emphasize the danger of'this prac
tice. Such a field will also increase 
the opportunities for the adoption of 
intramural sports such as exists at 
most other large colleges.
Twenty-five or thirty if hade trees 
will be planted about campus along 
with shrubbery which will be placed 
in the rear of the shelter houses on 
Forbes street. Another desirable im
provement will be the planting of 
grass and shrubbery and the con
struction of sidewalks and steps on 
the grounds around the newly-con
structed Cement Shed in the rear of 
Engineering Hall.
As soon as work on the new steam 
line leading into Boss Hall is com
pleted, the grounds around the boys 
dormitories will be enlarged and im
proved. This new high-pressure 
steam supply line is lo enter the 
basement of Boss Hall where a main 
regulator will be installed for the 
steam lines leading to the other 
dormitories. This improvement will 
greatly improve the efficiency of the 
steam heating system of the boys 
dormitories.

Yes sir, I am going to give ray 
$1.00 to the Endowment Fund. / You 
see, the charge of $1.00 for the 
locker for a whole year appears 
to me to be ridiculously small 'con
sidering-what convenience one derives 
from the use of the locker, and you 
can bet that I am willing to let the 
school have the $1.00, I am also 
not going to forget to return my key 
either.I notice that we are going to have 
an Exhibition on Friday * evening, 
April 25. I visited this exhibition 
last year, and surely did see a great 
number o wonderful things.. I also 
notice that they have the Kiltie 
Band and the R. O. T. C. On 
Parade. This was a very fine irinoevation last year, and I am glad to 
note that they will duplicate it again 
this year. Better b'c on time to see 
this performance, and also get 
good start, before the' crowds arrive, 
for from what I saw last year, I 
believe half of Pittsburgh .was on 
the Campus at this Exhibit.
I wonder how riiany signed up for 
the Supplementary Term which begins 
May 5. There isnt much time left 
now, so I would advise all those who 
are contemplating this dose to get 
in line and sign up so that you can 
be assured of a place in class in 
case there is a large enrollment. 
This certainly give a chance to get an 
irregular course straightened out.

E SEngineers Feel Slighted
Phone Booths Requested For 
Engineering and Machin- 1 
ery Hall
The Engineers feel that they arc 
being slighted. No, it isnt any
thing serious; just a little addition 
to Engineering and Machinery 
Halls, which would make it a trifle, 
more convenient for us without any 
more expense to Carnegie Tech.
A telephone booth on the main 
floor of each of these buildings or 
some other suitable location, Which 
I think can be secured for the ask
ing by calling the Bell Telephone 
Company, is all that is requested.
At present the only pay station" 
phones on the Campus are on the 
basement floor of the Industries 
Building. For this reason the In
dustries students have probably 
felt this need of more phones less 
than the Engineers; Of course the 
Art School is co-cducational and the 
students over there never have to 
make phone calls; and the "Maggie 
Murphs being the recipients of 
calls couldn't use a "pay station" 
phone for receiving them even if 
they had otic.
The author of this article is not 
certain that there are no phone 
booths in Arts or Margaret Mor
rison, but he is certain that there 
are none in Engineering nor Ma
chinery Halls. So help us Engi
neers and give the women a break 
by providing a couple of phone 
booths.
P. S.Maybe several more booths 
conveniently placed on the campus 
would, also be appreciated even 
though the users were not as gal
lant as the Engineers.M. A. C.
EXHIBITION FRIDAY 
NIGHT, MAY 25
The annual exhibition will bo held 
Friday, April 25, starting with a 
parade on the Campus by the R. O. 
T. C. at 6:45 p. m. The major por
tion of the exhibition will open at 
7:30 p. m. and will contniue until 10:30 p. m.
Various shops and laboratories will 
be thrown open to the students and 
public and this forms 'a very inter
esting side line on how things are 
done at Carnegie.

As much as I'd like to enlarge 
on the theme of the whys and 
the wherefores of these ten best" 
books, space is limited and so for 
the notice this vignette has to suf
fice. Here goes.
Omnibus of Crime, because 
Miss Savers has here compiled a 
collection of crime stories that is 
unrivaled, and range from old fa
bles to the latest and best.
Lincoln, by Emil Ludwig, be
cause he has fearlessly if a little 
worshipfully written this biography 
in approved Luchvig fashion.
"Year In, You're Out," by Sam
uel Hoffenstein, because it is a 
book Of poems that are matchless 
in expression, and new in thought.
"Coronot, by Manuel Komroff, 
because every ten best has to 
have one of these epic1' books, and 
this will do as well as any other.
Woman of Andros, by Thorn
ton Wilder because it is sadly 
beautiful, rich in content' and 
Thornton Wilder.
All Quiet on the. Western 
Front," by Erich Maria Remarque be
cause it was the first and the best 
of the latest bunch of war books 
and was written by a German, 
proving that the war did not affect 
only the Alliesif you know what 
I mean.
A Farewell to Arms, by Ernest 
Hemingway, because it is really 
what is described best by saying, 
"Compelling and powerfully mov
ing.
And now for a group, of out and 
out novels which have here a placc 
because they are the best in their 
class:
Jews Without Money, by Mich
ael Gold, because it is realistic, a 
sort of novelized, human Street 
Scene."
Iron Man," by W. L. Burnett, 
because he has lost none of the 
swiftness of his earlier book, and 
bccausc of the ending.
Young Man of Manhattan, by 
Katherine Brush, bccausc I am es
sentially frivolous and prefer her 
to anyone of the above.

Night Student Council 
President Appeals 
To Night Students
In the--following letter, James H. 
Sansonctti, President of the Night 
Student Council makes an appeal to 
the night student body to aid the 
Endowment Fund.
Dear Fellow Students:
The Night Student Council haS 
recently launched a campaign to raise 
additional money for the 1946 En
dowment Fund. This years cam
paign differs slightly from previous 
ones. Heretofore the student body 
was solicited to donate the balance of 
the breakage deposit returnable to 
them. This method enabled the Coun
cil to raise a very substantial amount 
for the Endowment Fund. How
ever, sincc the Administration did 
not impose a breakage deposit fee 
this year, we are unable to solicit 
on this score. To offset this loss, 
Council is asking you to donate your 
lockcr key deposit.
During the remainder of this 
school year you will be approached 
by various council officers and other 
agents who will seek your signature 
authorizing Council to collect your 
locker key deposit and turn it over 
to the Endowment Fund. You are 
urged to sign this blank and do your 
part in making Carnegie Tcch the 
greatest school in the world.
The donations which we' obtain 
will be applied to an Activities 
Building for all student activities, a 
center which is sadly lacking on the 
campus. Already the available halls 
have been found inadequate for our 
purpose, and the sooner we obtain the 
funds, the sooner we will be able to 
start our building. Remember the 
Shelter pavilion which was securcd 
last year, and . which has been a 
much' needed improvement.
The night student body has al
ways shown its willingness to co
operate with any projects sponsored 
by the Night Student Council to aid 
in developing Carnegie, and I feel 
confident that they , will, give this 
present move their whole hearted 
support and carry it to a great suc
cess.
Sincerely,
J. H. Sansonctti, 
President, Night Student Council,;
FIRST LOCKER KEY 
DONATIONS RECEIVED
In response to the. solicitation last1 
week in the Plaid,, the Night Student 
Council has received the first dona
tions to the Endowment Fund through 
the Lockcr Key Refund. This is 
very gratifying and we hope the 
example set by these early donations 
of the night students will be fol
lowed by a goodly number of our 
body.
All you have to do is sign the 
slip which was printed in last weeks 
issue of the Tartan, or sign one 
when you arc approached to do so, 
and either give the key to the, 
solicitor or, return it to the Lockcr 
Key Room, and your signature will 
be authority to turn over the $1.00 
to the Endowment Fund. The 
locker key must be returned in order 
to make your signature valid, other
wise the fee is forfeited. \
The Why Of The Dollar
On another part, of this page you 
will- find an article requesting the 
Night Students to subscribe the 
dollar which they deposited for 
their lpcker key to the 1946 En
dowment Fund.
There may be a question in the 
minds of some of the night stu
dents 'as to the purpose of this 
subscription. A short explanation 
of the purpose of this campaign 
will not be. amiss and may succccd 
in inducing you to do your bit to 
help this worth}' project.
Each year the Night Student 
Council has sponsored a campaign 
to solicit funds from the night stu
dents for the endowment fund to 
be applied toward the cost of con; structing ncccssary buildings on 
the Campus. Last year the amount 
collectcd went toward defraying 
the cost of construction of the 
Shelter Pavillion and the proposed 
Student Activities Building. Dur
ing the summer the Shelter House 
was built and is now filling a long 
needed purpose.
We are still in need of. a build
ing to be used for Student Activi
ties. This building would contain 
assembly halls, a dance hall, stu
dent publication offices; in fact, 
every' phase of collcgc social ac
tivities would find a home in this 
structure. Numerous colleges in 
the country have Student Activi
ties buildings and, with few excep
tions, the cost of construction was 
met by student and alumni con
tributions.
It is for this project that we 
are asking you to donate the dol
lar that you deposited for j-our 
locker key. It is a small amount 
and sincc you have already spent 
the dollar you will not be out any
thing when you are asked to sign 
a contribution card that will be 
distributed during the last weeks 
of the school. The money previ
ously contributed to this fund by 
Night Students is credited to the 
1946 Endowment Fund, but that 
does not mean that we will not 
have our Activities Building before 
that time. Money donated for 
buildings and applied to the En
dowment Fund can be used for 
that purpose at any time.
It is up to every Night Student 
to show that we as the Night Studcn body arc willing to assist in 
any campaign that is beneficial to 
Carnegie. Therefore, we asic that 
you donate your lockcr key dollar 
deposit to the Carnegie 1946 En
dowment Fund to be applied to 
the Student Activities Building project. G.
Carnegie To Observe 
Daylight Savings
Beginning next Monday, April 28, 
all classes- will begin at the usual 
hour on daylight saving time. This 
is in accord with the practice es
tablished several years ago and will 
continue for the balance of the 
school year.

University of Minnesota as yes men, 
the comment is too obvious to de
mand setting down in this limited 
space. He might have included many 
others among our most noted uni

beside president Elliott of Purdue and 
heard him say that he regarded the 
R. 0. T. C. unit of Purdue Uni
versity as the finest single influence 
in the university upon the life of 
the cadet. This page might be filled 
with similar testimony.
Again make no mistake. To furnish 
the force behind government is no 
fun. It is however a necessity if that 
government is to continue to exist, 
You can hire a man to run your 
store or your factory or your farm 
but where will you go to hire de
fense for your nation? To England, 
France, Germany,,. Japan 1 No, there 
is a burden of citizenship, and it is 
a burden, which rests, or should 
rest, on the shoulders of every

must have and which she cannot 
purchase elsewhere. These United

not take care of them no one else

COMMENTS ON EDITORIAL
Why An R. O. T. C. At Carnegie?
Editors Note:Following1 arc two of the best (or worse?) 
answers to last weeks editorial. We would advise the writers 
of these comments to read the editorial again and then con
demn. Both writers are military men and their attitude is 
typical to the extreme. Data for the editorial was taken from 
the report of President Hoover's Budget Committeewe did 
not advocate pacifism and neither did we advocate dissolution 
of the army, navy, air service or cavalry. The entire object 
was to show the fallacy as well as danger of such training as 
practiced in college and C.M.T.C camps. They accuse us of 
waving a red flag which is trite and idiotic, to say the least, but 
we expect an accusation any day from the Pitt Weekly exposing 
our acceptance of Communistic gold. However, read these com
ments carefully and examine their arguments for the weak 
points, misquotations and accusationsthere re plenty of them 
in each.

Editor, The Carnegie Tartan:
Indianapolis, Indiana, 
Dear Sir: I note your editorial of 
April 15, 1930 entitled Why an R. 
O. T. C. at Carnegie? I trust your 
spirit, of fair play will give these 
. comments equal prominence.
In the first place I would that the 
writer had signed his or her full 
name. "L" looks so much like the 
writer did not have I he courage of 
his convictions, In the accoml jflo.ee 
I would that the writer, L" had been 
a little more temperate, and less in
sulting to the Carnegie young ladies; 
and that he had been more necurate 
in his statements,
Then one wonders whether or not 
the writer is related in any way to 
the author of the communist tirade 
against the R. 0. T. J. which was 
distributed among Carnegie students 
recently at the beginning of a school 
year, A signed name, instead of an 
initial would permit us to determine 
that. It is a curious and startling fact 
that the religious radical, and the 
communist, '1 radical, both combine 
in trying to hamper the governmental 
program of military instruction. The 
announcement that Columbia had 
abolished the compulsory feature in 
her R. O. T. C. unit was received 
with great acclaim at a communist 
assembly. When one who may think 
himself possessed of high ideals 
finds himself advocating the same 
measures as a group advocating 
anarchy, atheism and free love it is 
at least time to stop and think.'
Mr. "L charges or asks why girl 
sponsors of the R, O. T. C. unStoop to this form of advertising. 
Refers to them as "Some little lady 
from frog hollow, and as seeking 
notoriety and publicity that goes 
with the positions. Permit me to 
remark that it is such intemperate 
insults that make war between nations. 
This may be another reason for the 
\ signature with a mere L." One would 
hardly have expected such war pro
ving words and sentiments from 
\an of pcace.
\ L. intimates that second lieuV will Stand in a safe area 
Whg others." And he speaks of 
uniforms costing $4.25. 1 hope his 
other statements and quotations are 
more accurate. 1 have been through 
three wars and 1 have never seen a 
sale place for second lieutenants or 
a uniform costing as little as $4.25.' 
There is no safe place in war: but 
the most unsafe place of all is fol
lowing a leader who it not trained 
lo lead, which is apparently what 
Mr. "L" is aiming at. Let me set 
you straight. Any man who has seen
war will tell you that Sherman was
right, War is hell." He will advise 
you to do everything possible lo. keep 
your nation out of War, short of 
surrendering your power to protcet 
her citizens in their right lo life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
But he will also remember the thou
sands of lives .'which unprepared 
loaders cost us, lives which would
have been saved had our people had 
leaders of the caliber and attain
ments of the present R. O. T. C. 
graduate.
Then, too, I challenge Mr. Ls 
intimation that the preparation for 
war as had in the R. O. T. C. tends 
0 make our people war minded and
to bring on war. If making prepara
tion against a thing tends lo bring 
it on, then China, the least prepared 
nation on earth, ought lo' be the 
most peacefulread your newspaper I 
And Switzerland, the country where 
every man in the nation has to bear 
his military obligation and is taught 
how to - it, ought to be the most 
war ridden: but if you will read 
your history before going IT half 
cocked oi\ ibis proposition you will 
find that Switzerland, the best pre
pared nation on the face of the 
earth, is the only nation which has 
not had a war for a hundred years. 
If this logic is correct, better hurry 
home and take off your locks and 
padlocks, before you arc led to de
sire lo have your property stolen; 
lake your money and valuables from 
banks and safe deposit boxes ere 
you want to lose them; fire your 
pollccmon and constables and sheriffs 
less they lead you to desire the de
predations of thieves and burglars 
and bandits; do not take oul life in
surance; it will most assuredly cause 
you to want to commit suicidc, and 
some fools do just that; do not lake 
out fire ihsurance or you will desire 
to burn your property. Why, then, 
should taking oul national insurance 
make us want to burn up our na
tion 1 But what soui. ! business man 
docs not take out insurance 1 
And the R. O. T. C. is a part of 
that national insurance which furnish
es the power behind the government 
that enables it to set the course of 
the old ship of state as our wise 
men think it should be set, and to 
keep it there. It is also far more 
than that. Its close order drills and 
military routine constitute the best 
habit formation system known to man 
for the inculcation of habits of ac
curacy, promptness, team work and 
obedience to authority. That is but 
natural. These habits are basically 
vital to succcss on the battlefield. We 
have found that out on that battle
field when a man is tired,' maybe 
sick, hungry, most certainty half 
scared to death, that the only things 
he can be depended upon to do, arc 
the things he has learned to do 
habitually. The army officer there
fore has had, through the centuries, 
been  compelled to make a closer 
study of habit formation, systems that 
the instructor in any other profes
sion, for the very simple reason 
that the inculcation of the above 
habits are matters of life and death 
to him. And that he has been suc
cessful in his habit formation work is 
amply proved by the fact that the 
R. O. T, C. graduate stands out 
among others of the student body be
cause of these habits. While others 
hear them talked about lie, the R. 
O. T. C. cadet, has LIVED them in 
his drills and daily military habit 
formation routine.
Mr. L" insults the intelligence 
of the American people when he in
timates that the growth of the R. O. 
T. C. units is due lo the mach^avelian 
machinations of any partisan group.

April 17, 1930. 
The Editor,
The Carnegie Tartan.
Dear Sir: We do not know
whether you arc sufficiently openminded or unprejudiced to publish 
the inclosed reply to your recent 
editorial, but it is submitted in the 
hope that such may be the ease.
Yours truly, 
Frank C. Mason,
We offer the following set of 
answers not because we think they 
will be especially appreciated by 
the one who elicited them, but be
cause they arc the natural spon
taneous production of a number of 
rather preposterous rhetorical ques
tions, the solutions to which were 
very generously left to the in
telligence of the reader. It is not 
our intention to imply, in the rcmotcst degree, that said reader 
lacks sufficient intelligence to ar
rive at the correct answers, but 
we arc merely following the classic 
example of the problcm-book writ
ers whofor some inexplicable 
reasonforthwith proceed to com
pile a set of approved solutions. 
Our questioner, too, has interpolat
ed between his questions a deal of 
inapplicable matter calculated to 
lead the student astray, which 
tempts us to wonder if this isnt 
possibly his subtle way of taking 
a poke at some Physics tcxtbc\ok 
writer. But having arrived at the 
conclusion that this is doubtless a 
bit too far-fetched for our matterof-fact mental processes, and de
cided that lie was serious in his 
catechising of his public, we will 
proceed to do him the service of 
compiling his answer-book.
Why should Carnegie tolerate 
military instruction?" The PT 
student should not,, it may he well 
to state parenthetically, attempt to 
answer this, any more than an ar
chitect could be cxpectcd to know 
what the stresses arc in a crank 
shaft. Having personally submit
ted to four years military instruc
tion in both the ROTC and CM 
TC, we feel that we are more or 
less .competent to offer a solution, 
but, at the same lime, we are par
ticularly desirous of gaining the 
confidence. of our rcacrcr at this 
early point in our treatise, so we 
shall seek a higher authority to 
throw light on the subject. Gen
eral Pershing has condensed most 
of the possible answers in an ad
mirable. style: . . . It will develop 
the .physical vigor and manhood 
of. our youth . and sharpen their 
mentality. It will leach self disci
pline and respect for constituted 
authority. As recent experience 
has shown, it encourages initia
tive and gives young men confi
dence in their abilities. . .-Associa
tion with men from all walks of 
life strikingly emphasizes its dem
ocracy. The training broadens the 
views and. increases the value ol 
our youth as citizens. . . Our ex
perience in the war proved that in 
the association, pf young men to
gether for a common purpose 
there was developed not only a 
new sense of patriotic obligation, 
but a very high moral attitude to' 
the individual. We believe that 
General Pershing has had more 
background from which to. draw 
the answer to our question than 
perhaps any other American, and 
although his opinion may he color
ed by the orthodox teachings of 
his profession, we think there are 
few who will question his ability 
to speak on the subjcct or the 
sincerity of his words. To state 
that the training imparted by our 
national preparedness system is 
ridiculous serves only to indicate 
the lack of information or intellec
tual incapacity of the speaker. An 
observer who bases his comments 
on'a casual glimpse of ROTC 
units going through infantry drill 
movements on the campus should 
maintain silence if lie has the best 
interests of his country in mind. 
Yet we cannot understand 'how 
even so incomplete an understand
ing of what constitutes military 
training, could not impress one 
with the benefits in the form of 
developed powers of co-ordination, 
sclf-confidcncc, and leadership. 
Twcnly-three per pent of the in
fantry platoon is vested with some 
degree of responsibility and lead
ership, the diligent exercising of 
which leads to something better 
We will commit the crime of ask' 
ing a rhetorical question by in
quiring what the deleterious effects 
of such a system are.
It is gratifying to note that the 
fact is recorded that military 
training, aside from the benefits
R. S. V. P.
R. S. V. P. arc the letters of four French words meaning will you kindly reply. These letters arc used on formal invitations, though they have now lost some of their original significance.
In earlier days when communication was ;morc difficult than now, letters and invitations were often sent by hand of a private 
messenger, and R. S. V. P. was added as a polite invitation to answer by the returning messenger. And so R. S. V. P. has come down to us as an ancient heirloom and has become a part of our present day formal invitation.
Butshould it be necessaryin these days of . easy commun- ciation, of fountain pens, two ccnt stamps, letter boxes everywhere 
and several collections as well as deliveries each day, to say nothing of the telephone in every home. I say, should it be necessary to place R. S. V. P. on any invitations? Is not the lady who is gracious enough to think of me and send me an invitation entitled lo the courtesy of an immediate reply'1 Why, of course, she is!. I 1 But how docs this idealOf course she is worlc out in practice? Here is an example:
A certain lady invited sixty-eight guests to her party. -She wrote all the invitations, addressed and mailed them. She expected answers, of course, otherwise how could she order and plan her party? But here is what happened. Out of sixty-eight invited guests, twenty-three, answered, twelve accepted and eighteen arrivedeighteen husbands and wives with the hostess, made a party of thirty-seven. Perhaps it was better so. It was certainly a delightful party. Of course, quite a number of guests were invited Avho were not expected, that often happens. Perhaps some were too far away and others for various reasons were unable to come. But how about those who failed to show any appreciation of the courtesy bestowed upon them. Who failed to help their hostess arrange her partywho failed to recognize their obligationan obligation that goes with every social invitation?
R. S. V. P. written or unwritten has ahVays existed-----existsnow, and always will exist throughout all social life. That being so would it not he better to omit the formal R. S. V. P. from all invitations and scar into our personalities the everlasting obligation which these letters imply.
heretofore mentioned, produces | 
clean young men, and it is fur
ther gratifying to find that this 
trite expression was correctly - in
terpreted, even amplified with lov
ing care. If, by any chance, any 
insinuations were intended ancnt 
the value of warm baths and clean 
teeth, we arc glad to know enough 
to keep our distance hereafter.
To answer the inquiry into the 
where for of our large military ex-, 
penditurcs, we fear it will be nec
essary to introduce a few figures. 
It is stated that $700,000,000 wilj 
be spent for military purposes in 
the present year, a figure we are 
Unfortunately unable to confirm or 
deny, but from data for the pre
ceding year we are inclined to be
lieve it includes everything re
motely connected to Avar, particu
larly expenses incidental, to  t|u* 
World war. The War Department 
spent about 321 millions last year, 
out of a budget of three and a 
quarter billions, or about 10 per 
cent of the total budget. In eohr 
trafct to this,'Britain spent 14.2 per 
ccnt, Italjr 23.4 per cent, France 
2S.8 per cent, Poland, 38.7 per cent 
and Turkej' 40 pcr cent; these are 
truly analagous figures. This main
tains a regular army in the U., S. 
of about 140,000 men, in the Brit
ish Empire of about 330,000, in 
France of about 570,000 men, in 
Italy of about 370,000. Thee funds, 
also support reserves and prepara
tory units in all countries, and the 
very,, nature of the data we have 
presented indicates how our coun
try fares in this respect. In addi
tion, most European countries 
spend enormous funds for physical 
educational purposes, which are 
not, of course, included in the 
military budget, though they strict
ly should be.
We arc met with the statement 
that the question of pacifism is be
ing completely ignored in the de
velopment of the discussion,.which 
produces an impulsive dash to 
Webster to refresh our1 memory 
of what the word means. If this 
wholesale casting of aspersions on 
the present system of military 
training in our schools is not pure 
pacifist propaganda, well agree to 
subscribe to the Nation, and find 
out what the genuine article looks 
like. We do not think such a lineof thought is. at all called for. from
a citizen of one of the 19 countries 
out of the worlds 56counting 
cach state in the British Empire a 
countyin. which compulsory mili
tary training of all its males is 
not cnforccd. 'Were this France, 
in which all males of from 21 to 
49 must perform military service, 
or Italy, where the war depart
ment starts its roster at the cradle 
there might be some' excuse for 
sympathy.
But in ' the United States the 
posing of such a series of ques
tions sound like rumbles from Len
ingrad; instead of our educators 
being drupes of the jingoes, the in
nocent protageoriist of such views 
is being inadvertently of infinite 
service to the Soviet cause. The 
thirty Pioneer camps held, last 
summer in .the country under the 
auspices of the U. S. S. R., in op
position to the Boy Scouts, car
ried such advertising slogans as 
Fight Against the ROTC, Fight 
the CMTC, War is Coming. Join 
the Young Pioneers, and in these 
camps boys were taught, the Soviet 
creed when they should have been 
getting the physical benefit of a 
Boy Scout or CMTC camp. John 
Steele in the Red Daily Worker, 
states that When the proper ap
proach is made to the National 
Guardsman it is a v.crj>- easy matter 
to find recruits for the League or 
Party and . to completely demoral
ize the organization and wc must 
guarantee that the National Guard 
knows what direction to turn its 
guns. This, too, is an attitude 
that is rcpcllant to most of us, 
and military training as it exists in 
the U. S. strengthens opposition 
to it, thereby ensuring the contin
ued existence of our country.
We have the unpleasant fecliny 
that wc arc creating an anti-climax1 
when wc give our answer ,as to 
the relation of military training to 
sex appeal and the young ladies, 
but at the same time' wc arc under 
the impression that this is the key
note of the dissertation in ques
tion, so it would be unbecoming 
of us to pass it up, . even though 
it be a rather more frivolous sub
ject than we are in the habit of 
discoursing upon. Speaking- in 
large terms, -the -objects-of life are 
to Render Service and Gain Hap
piness, and regardless of what or
der WC assisil to these- liaDDUieS5
looms large to all of us. Th 
pretty lady who is honored with 
the title of Military Queen is 
overjoyed with- the distinction and 
those who bestow it upon her 
arc equally delighted to be able 
to pa homage to beauty. The 
only ones who do not gain 
pleasure from the cercmony are 
the soiir-grapcs bitter-sweets, those 
who begrudge the popularity ac
cruing to the ROTC from the 
event, and perhaps some of the 
less noble-minded of the distin
guished ladys boy friends. And it 
is our opinion that few Will waste 
their sympathies on any of these; 
at all odds, the net result is an in
crement of joy on the face of the 
earth, which is the most we can 
hope for.
It is difficult to contemplate ra
tionally some of the scntcnccs that 
await our comment. We arc sup
posed, it seems, to be highly 
alarmed at the existence of a sys
tem calculatcd to keep that 
anachronism, War, constantly in 
the minds of our youth, through 
subtle means of fascination, such 
as gay uniforms, brilliant parades, 
medals, bands, and so on. In the 
first placc, anyone but a hopelcs: 
idealist knows that word anachrO' 
riism" has been misused; and in 
the second placc we will wager 
that evcp . our. worthy reactionary 
has at some time been thrilled by 
the inspiring sight of waves of 
oli^c-drab figures marching in step 
to the music behind the emblem of 
their country, the Stars and Stripes. 
He may call that hokum if lie de
sires; it isnt, because it is some' 
thing wc cannot control or modi
fy; it is a part of our higher na
tures. To allow the youth, of our 
nation the privilege of strengthen
ing ' this patriotic urge, allowing 
them to take their, share of the 
thrill of a parade at sunset, is hot 
exploiting the weaker emotional
ism of mankind, nor leading 
these .boys and girls to act irra
tionally and foolishly on matters 
of international relations. It- is 
merely giving them a portion of 
the better side of life, teaching 
them to better themselves and 
those in contact with them, and 
insuring our government from dis 
truction. Military training teaches 
the realism of Avar to a nation 
much better than a routine life 
that ignores it; just as General 
Summerall has stated that it is not 
our army that makes Avar, but 
rather the citizen, and the army 
must thereupon finish the Avar, so 
the more the doctrine of military 
training in our schools spreads the 
iriore the nation Avill know of Avhat 
Avar really is, and the more quickly 
a Avar may be ended, once it has 
becomc inevitable. No, to recog
nize the last question mark, we do 
not belieArc Dr. Baker recognizes 
the insidious implications" in our 
system of training the youth of 
America for preparedness as he re

has been brought to light by Mr.

Due chicfly to the great amount 
of interest crcated iii the campus 
activities revealed in the April Fool 
issue of the Tartan, preparations 
are being made to handle the larg
est crowd in school history at the 
exhibition this Friday night. Each 
and every department, is doing its 
utmost to put its best foot fonvard, 
Avith the result that here Avill be 
many new and novel exhibits which 
we had no idea existed.
For example, take the all-im
portant Commercial Engineering 
Department. For the past month 
these likely lads have been de
vouring Milton Works precious 
volumes and will entertain all 
comers with the hoA\r and Avliy of 
biidgc. Visitors to the realms . of 
the countrys foremost salesmen 
will have an opportunity, to lcarti 
of the Loxterman finesse, the Kamback act, and will, in addition, see 
the budding young newspaper 
men in the act of blossoming: 
Arrangements have also been made 
to place Dodo Wright in the cen
ter ' of the hall, on a platform, 
Avhere his manly, intriguing profile 
may be viewed from all angles. 
Then, of course, Emery Sutch Avill 
explain the reccnt Benson mystery, 
Avhich should prove interesting.
Over in Arts school there Avill 
be a concert1 given by the Mens 
Glee Club, Avith Miss Mary Eliza
beth Hoffman as bass soloist. John 
Barnes, of course, Avill accompany 
hereArerywhere. They Avill feature 
FoiloAving You. The drama de
partment is going to forego the 
usual one-act playlets this year; 
but, as a substitute, will offer 
Buzz Ivountz in My Picture in 
the Paper, or What the Well 
Dressed Man Will Wear for a 
Cash Consideration." Jack Bur
roughs, the first printer to. turn 
dramat in two Avceks, will also be 
there.
The civil engineers Avill do their 
bit, too. The remarkable civil 
senior Avlio obtained the job will 
be bedecked in his Sunday best, 
Avhile Charles Sclsam will be on 
hand, purple, tie and all. Then, too, 
there is Harold Pole Wcitzel, 
who cant be missed.,. In addition, 
Doug Seely, will deliver his.unusual 
Seminar address in his usual unique 
fashion. .
Thistledown will be on hand, too, 
having prepared an excellent ad
dress on How to Hate the Grille, 
Yet Be Able \o Eat There Every 
ay, Avhich he Avill deliver over 
the voice of the diaphragm.in.order 
to keep secret his identity.
Of course, Joe Hcrbst Avill usher 
the people into Cedar Hall, for no 
one on the campus is as familiar,
Avith that place as he is, while 
Koultcr Ziegler will do the sanie 
thing at the Annex. Visitors should 
not be surprised if they have to 
ring the doorbell more than once.
At Margaret Morrison, anything 
rqay happen. We hear that the 
Costume Economics Seniors are 
going to dress Jack Horning up 
in his purple shirt and red tic, 
which they have given him because 
lie is the . only one Avith nerve 
enough to Avcar it, and will offer 
a prize to the person making the 
elosest guess as to what he repre
sents. The sccrctarials Avill all be 
there, typing as only sccrctarials 
can. These girls arc trying to figure
