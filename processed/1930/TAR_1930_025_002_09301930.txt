Good Form in Running 
and Passing
In opening their 1930 football 
season the Tartans decisively 
trounced any traces of even fair 
football material in Buffalo, and 
in doing so, emphasized the fact 
that it takes more than beef and 
brawn to make a good football 
team. The teams were matched 
in size, but Carnegie exhibited that 
aggressiveness and stamina which 
are so necessary for class. Oppo' sition was lacking and our flashing 
Steffenites enjoyed the proverbial 
tijack meet in the Bison's back
yard. The lopsided score of 75 
to( 2 was typical .of the game, flic 
big Bisons presented a game fight. jg team which was naturally out
classed by a . driving ^ squad of 
Scoots that romped at will to touch
downs.'Carnegie rang up a score that is 
oijly significant of early football 
.games. One-way traffic,, which re
versed. each quarter, was the ordcjr of the day. The. man on the 
scjore board was required to use 
alll the numbers in his vocabulary, 
arid was certainly guilty of put
ting in a days work.
For the sake of safety, the 
Bisons were awarded a total of 
two points and a complete white
wash for their trying efforts dur
ing the game. It is also intcrestibjg to note that, with a delegation 
ok 36 players, enough points were 
scored so each man could have 
' l^vo to send home and there would 
still be some to boot. While, on 
 the other foot, it took the entire 
lluffajo squad to amass a twin 
"count.
" Tlie alTair was not a howling 
naricial success, and the natives 
ere naturally disappointed in 
icir team. However, the populace 
of Buffalo was treated to a good 
simple of classical football and 
how it is played in a city where 
a tackle is a tackle and street cars 
can run any time or place they 
desire. 
Eyth and Roscnzwcig Effective 
pie; game was marked by the 
clcivcr maneuvering of Dutch Eyth 
and Ted Rosenzweig, the accurate 
kicking of Captain Dreshar, and 
frclquent penalties. Eyth made four 
ruins averaging 35 yards each, and
d ur 
lent
that time he gave an excel 
exhibition of throwing off
ladders and reversing his field. In 
the course of his play, Dutch 
crossed the goal line four times. 
Rose_nz\veig is responsible for sev
era of the seven passes completed 
by the Tartans. Teds timely gains 
slonved the Buffalonians that the 
Clii-negie outfit was no one-horse 
'affair. In the opening minutes of 
plyay we find Ted chalking up the 
iii)fst Slx counters which were mag^niffitfd a dozen times before the 
fijlial whistle blew.
McCurdy, at quarterback, cmpl oyed straight line plays for the 
most..part with a smattering of 
p asses. Many times the Tartans 
crossed the goal by drives begun

Opportunity Takes the Dollar Bill Aspect to 
Carnegies Vacationing Co-Eds and Eddies
The unemployment crisis had not 
such telltale effects on Carnegies 
Co-eds and Eddies the past sum
mer, if one is to believe figures 
numerical ones. T rue, more for
sook the city streets for distant 
spots, not because they coveted the 
honor that supposedly accompanies 
increased milcagci but because op
portunity with a dollar-bill-halo 
beckoned.' And while the more 
fortunate vacation<jd at leisure, 
these hustlers were on the up-andup pulling down the payroll. Such 
diversity of employment as recorded 
is startling when one considers the 
scope of the average individual, but 
each one generally followed the 
occupation for which his course at 
Cajnegic prepared him; this hitch
ing ones wagon to a nearby at
tainable star is ample proof of 
their levelheadedness.
A P & D, for instance, didnt 
start out planting corn and toma
toes (a change heartily advocated 
by; health authorities), but rather
hied himself to the boardwalk, the 
rolling ocean, and the level sands, 
which were his working material. 
Here the artist fashioned sandlikenesses of his audience, egged 011 
by the musical clink of, silver 
shekels and stray collar buttons 
flung from dizzy heights in pay
ment. He aimed to please, had 
sufficient target practice; and bang 
hit the bulls-eye of popular ac
claim.
Among the fifty-odd boys placed 
by the bureau, varied positions 
were held, covering every phase of 
human activity but sidewalk sax 
tooting or window pancake flop
ping. Two boys braved the in
terior of girls' camps, each a lone 
representative of his sex among 
the deadly species, each emerging 
from the wilderness alive and sane, 
with an address book filled to over
flowing. Opportunity, thou knockest 
but onceand what is so handy 
,at that point as a pad on which to

Extraordinary Plebe Antics Result From
Modern Vogue Toward Endurance Craze
Well, theyre here again; new 
recr.uits annually trying for record 
flights, three point landings, et al. 
Funny that the style doesnt change: 
something like an old car with a 
new paint job.* * *
Reports are out that nearly every 
plebe has remarked to the effect 
that lie, she, or it is going out for 
marks the first year. (Were laugh
ing). That's not all. They still 
think the Grills a grand place to 
eat.* * *
And speaking of reCord flights;
will the usual percentage take a 
noserdive after mid-semesters, or 
will the gliders keep on gliding? 
Who knows? Aiany a good joy 
stick gets out of control at record 
altitudeand plenty of endurance 
fliers have slept at the switch. But 
Lindy didnt get there without 
plenty of figuring either.* * *
And while doling out the skepticism, maybe the fledglings could 
Use some nice wholesome encour
agement, peppered with a smile and 
a pat on the b^ck. What say?* * * *
The usual welcome plebes is in 
the last throes of a timely, demise 
so thats OUT. They know they're 
welcome (ask the boys who were 
in the pajammer parade). The re
ception wasnt so ambassadorial as 
the usual trans-Atlantic fliers, but 
it was just as noisy. And besides 
being welcome they provide con
venient emotional outlets for the 
vengeful sophs, (cf. Dr. Schocn).* * *
Then, too, they say such "cute 
things. One was actually overheard 
saying she loved her teacher. From 
one look at her, were willing to 
change places with the prof and 
slip him a couple- of dollars to 
boot.* * *

Aeronauts Bid For Buggy Ride But Pretty 
- Co-Eds Engaging Smile Captures Prize
Fall is a buggy timelong-suf
fering flies, locusts, beetles, and 
grasshoppers ^iclp to make life 
pleasant-or miserable, depending on 
whether or not one likes bugs. 
Last Friday a bigger bug than any 
of the aforementioned nuisances 
made its appearance on the Car
negie campus: the tempting gliding 
bug visited Schcnley Park anti great 
was the damage which followed its 
appearance. Not only were several 
of the mighty engineers bitten, but 
one slim young co-ed received 
quite a severe jolt.
The scene yof the action was the 
long slope of Flagstaff Hill. Betty 
Co-ed and Tom, Dick and Harry 
all had a tussle with the bug. 
Sometimes they glided, but more 
often the bug gave them a taste, 
of broncho tactics and the glide 
was merely a series of bumps and 
jerks.
Betty Co-eds' struggle with the 
bug was the most interesting of 
?.ll. Bravely! she hopped on the
insects back, and, after being 
pushed and taunted by those he 
had conquered, the glider declared 
war. Action started. He swooped 
and swerved in a vain endeavor to 
upset Betty, but kicking him glee
fully with her .heels Betty remained 
immovable. Such a total disregard 
for his authority roused the bug to 
one final effort. Swooping madly 
and careening furiously on one 
wing lie managed to partially un-. 
seat his valiant rider. In a noble 
effort to regain her balancc, Betty 
threw all her weight on one of his 
wings. The contact between head 
and wing w-as too much for the 
bug! With a sigh lie crumpled 
silently to the ground, the injured 
wing hanging limply, like an or
gandie dress that has been sub
jected to a drenching rain. The 
engineers rushed up, expecting to 
find Betty with a cut and bleeding 
head, but Betty, smiling com
placently, jumped from the gliders

Need of Modern Equip
ment Realized in Eu
ropes Scientists
Dr. Krivobac of the department of 
metallurgical engineering has just re
turned from a trip' to Europe, where 
lie was sent to survey the graduate 
courses in metallurgy given by the 
leading universities.
Among the schools and universities 
visited by Dr. Krivobac were the 
University of Grenoble, the Uni
versity of Berlin, the University of 
Paris, the Sorbonnc, the School of 
Arts and Sciences in Paris, and 
various Italian universities. He found 
that they differed widely from our 
schools in their methods of conduct
ing the graduate courses and in their 
equipment.
Equipment, in the schools abroad, 
is much less modern and complete 
than that found in colleges here. 
However, they are aware of this 
condition, and extensive improvmcnts 
arc being planned.
Rigid Degree Qualifications 
Post, graduate workers in metal
lurgy, who are usually given a free 
hand in their experimental research 
in this country, have much less free
dom of choice in the European 
school, and arc often given definite 
assignments. Here, on the other hand, 
students follow their own bent in 
the matter of research and generally 
work alone, with the occasional guid
ance of their superiors,
Another feature of the European 
system is the rigorous oral examina
tion to which every degree candidate 
must submit. This is in addition la 
the regular reports and these which 
constitute a part of the work oft 
graduate students in the United 
States.  The degree awarded is that 
of doctor of science.
Graduate Course I-Ierc 
The metallurgy department at Car
negie has established a graduate 
course in that subject. The department 
has grown very rapidly, and it 
present has the largest .enrollment; of 
aiiy school with a department of this 
kind, according to James Aston, head 
of the department of metallurgy.
As Dr. Krivobac explained, there 
arc three types of graduate students. 
The first type consists of young 
men who spend all their time doing 
original research, and who pay all 
their own fees and expenses. The 
second type arc those who hold 
what is known as a teaching fellow
ship. These men teach a total of 
perhaps six hours a week, and spend 
the rest of their time in original re
search. Those who hold research fel
lowships constitute the third cla^s, 
spending all their time in research.
This year the United States Navy 
has sent four men to Carnegie with 
research fellowships in metallurgical 
engineering. This fact, together with 
the increasing percentage of students, 
augurs well for the high esteem, 
with which Carnegies department is 
regarded everywhere.

JOHN ALMS
Tuesday, September 23, marked the 
closing of the Tartan training camp 
after three weeks of arduous work
outs. During this period the Tcch 
bowl witnessed some of the bloodiest 
scrimmages and fighting in its his
tory, and many a son of "Wally and 
Bob" can vouch for this with their 
euliflower cars, broken noses, black
ened eyes, twisted legs, and numer
ous "Charley horses.
Labor day was the formal open
ing of the camp, although for some 
odd days before, the linemen . had 
already reported, and were going 
through a series of workouts, wljich 
included calisthenics and fundamen
tals, although there was very little 
use of the latter.
No time was wasted in swinging 
into the practice routine, and within 
a week the fight for positions had 
begun in earnest. Only eleven men 
were to be picked from 6 ends, 9 
tackles, 7 guards, 3 centers, and a 
host of backficld men, and as scrim
mages continued many a. veteran lost 
sleep wondering ii^ some flowering 
sophomore or junior would cop his 
position. The open guard position 
was the most keenly fought for, with 
Bert Pouncey, Bill Sample, and 
"Bunny Burzio holding the lead, 
while the center position held a 
close second as Alex Ducanis and 
Red Jones, captain of the 1929 
Plebe team fought it out between 
themselves.
The second w'cck of the camp saw 
little letup in the fighting spirit, al
though some of the veterans as 
Captain Dreshar, Pete Flanagan, 
"Tank I-Iighberger, Ted . Rosensweig, 
Slats Flanagan, HarrjA McCurdy, 
and, "Dutch Eyth had little to worry 
about.
However, at the beginning of the 
final period things began to get com
plicated again, when after a scries 
of fierce encounters "Slats Flanagant 
"Army, Kcrmit Ewing, and "Bunny" 
Burzio added their names to the 
hospital list. This gave some of the 
small, but fast sophomore backficld 
men a chance to show' their stuff, 
Kavel and Gravcno. took full ad
vantage of this and in a few days 
gave the coaches an exhibition of 
line plunges, and open field running.
The last few days of camp were 
used entirely for running plays, and 
scrimmages, and flashes of a cham
pionship team were seen at times. 
With few exceptions, all the men 
were in the* pink of condition by 
this time, and promised to give foot
ball fans a treat this season. With 
three full teams on the bench at all 
times, and the Buffalo game already 
under the belt, an.I securcly tied, 
Carnegie Tcch. should witness' one of 
the greatest seasons in the reign 
of football at this school.
The Carnegie Tech freshman 
griddcrs opened the season with a 
win over the hard fighting eleven 
of the Indiana State Teachers' Col
lege Saturday at the Teachersnew 
field by a score of 19-0.
The Indiana lads put up' a stub
born fight from the opening whis
tle and kept the Plebes out of the 
scoring zone throughout the first 
quarter. In the second period the 
freshman outfit came back strong 
and rushed the teachers off their 
feet. In this chapter Sayles the 
big gun of the Baby Tartans 
backficld, carried the ball across 
for two touchdowns. The Plebes 
other score came-in the final stan
za after a march down the field. 
Sayles added the point and the 
scoring for the day was ended.
Next Saturday the Plebes tackle 
the strong first year club from W. 
& J. at the Stadium. This is the 
first home showing for the Tartan 
squad and the young Presidents 
from Washington will find a prim
ed eleven. This years Plebe out
fit is'the big powerful type and 
should outweigh most of their op
ponent throughout the season. 
With a big line and a fast set of 
backs they should put up a battle 
next Saturday that will certainly 
be worth seeing.

"Dutch Eyth, one of the cleverest little ball carriers that ever wore the plaidjust watch, you'll hear lots of Dutch this year . . .
As the many activities swing in
to co-operation, -so the noisy end of 
-Carnegie has been at work to bring 
about a successful season in the 
cheer-leading business. Extensive 
and worth-while plans are being 
completed, and with the help of the 
student body it is certain they will 
make an impressive showing this 
season, both- on the field and in 
the stands.
Six varsity chccr-lcadcrs have re
turned for duty, and four freshmen 
have been added to the squad. -The 
call is still on for more fre'shmen 
who can imagine themselves mak
ing one or more people yell their 
heads off. Fall is the big season 
fcr this activity and now is the 
time to get started in it. The first 
ten good freshmen that report to 
tho Trophy Room these afternoons 
will be given instructions and be 
tried out. Pat Jacobs, head cncerleader, is planning to use about 20 
men in the stadium games. It is 
an active job, and good substitutes 
are necessary. An average, of five 
cheer-lcadcrs will be taken on each 
football trip and in the course or 
four years, two . .letters may be 
earned. These organizers of noise 
arc really more important to the 
college than the mastcr-of-cercmonics are to the movies, for they 
arc the connecting link between the 
students and. the team while on the field."
All first year students will enjoy 
a new freshman privilege at the 
games. An entire' section will be 
reserved for their cause, and in 
return they will give a unique 
demonstration in color and noise 
under the guidance of the cheerlcadcrs. .Each freshman will re
ceive an oil-cloth jacket to wear 
during the game. While this piccc 
of apparel is guaranteed to give 
protection under the dripping 
clouds and, pop bottles, its real 
purpose is to form a white back
ground, which will bring out the 
colored demonstrations' with the 
greatest clarity. The success of this 
depends upon the ability of fresh
men to follow directions. It is hoped 
that' they will outlive their reputa
tion and do the corrcct thing at the right time.
At 11:30 this morning the fresh
men will be given a chance to re
view the song; and yells. By re
quest of the cheer-lcadcrs, and.probably the entire collegc, we hope to 
get some new yells for Carnegie. 
Set your noodle to working and 
lets produce a fewr snappy original 
cheers that will make people take
With the opening match of the 
season less than three weeks away, 
Coach Guy Halfcrty is bearing 
down on his cross-country aspir
ants, and is sending them over the 
tough course in Schcnlcy Park daily.
Although only a few men were 
lost by graduation last year, Coach 
I-Ialferty will not make any pre
dictions about the success of this 
years squad. Carnegie has always 
had good cross-country teams and 
this years team will not be an 
exception,, as the men have had ex
perience and are improving daily. 
Captain Price is< doing his best to 
help the. Coach inakc the season a 
success.
The schedule this year is very 
difficult and beside the opening 
match with Geneva on Octobcr ,15, 
it will include meets' with West
minster, New York University, 
Pitt and West Virginia.
The Plebe team has just , started 
to practice and it is impossible to 
tell what kind of a team they will 
have. Coach Iialferty wishes to 
announce that any freshmen inter
ested in cross-country should re
port to- him any day in the gym. 
So far, only a fewr first year men 
have reported for practice and 
there is an excellent chance to 
make the team. A tcnative sched

Nevertheless the Lutheran boys

than last week's encounter. Thiel, 
with no visions of beating Temple, 
held them to a 13-6 score. This 
sounds well, but after. next Satur

IN MEMORIAMARRANGEMENT
It is with deep regrets that the 
Plaid announces the deaths ot two 
students who were registered the 
past year, Carl Hultman .and L. 
P. Cuip.
Carl Hultman was a night studcntt 
in Mcchanical Engineering. L. P.' 
Culp was a student in Night Indus
tries, being in the second year Gen
eral Studies.
We extend our sympathy to the1 
families of these departed night stu
dents.
We are also sorry to report the 
death of Mrs. John Manson, wife ot' 
Mr. John Manson, head watchman, 
who died during the past week. In 
your bereavement Mr. Manson, you 
have the sympathy of the whole night 
student body of Carnegie.
A new arrangement has been 
put into, effect in regard to the 
lockers. Plerctoforc the Institute 
placed at the. disposal of the stu
dents a lockcr upon the deposit of 
$1 for a key. This fee was return
able provided the key was surren
dered at the close of the school 
year. This practice has been dis
continued starting with this year, 
and the following procedure ob
tains.
The Institute will sell each stu
dent a patented combination pad
lock for $1, and upon presenting 
the card and padlock which is is
sued to the locker key room in 
the basement of Administration 
Hall, the student will be assigned 
a locker which is located as near 
as possible to his section. These 
padlocks will be sold at the book 
store in the basement of Adminis
tration Hall. No lockers will be 
assigned unless* the student pur
chases the padlock and secures the 
assignment card. The Institute 
expects your co-operation in mak
ing this new arrangement a "suc
cess.
Points to be remembered: Pur
chase your padlock, secure your 
assignment from the Locker Key 
Room, locate the posjlion of your 
locker. Students must secure their 
correct assignment before a locker 
is available to them.

Published oncc every week during the collcgc year by undergraduates of Carnegie 
Inatltuie of Technology. Entered In Ihc Pittsburgh Post Office a* iccond-class matter.
Years of controversy over these 
two cases finally ended with favor
able results about two years ago 
and both are now allowed. What 
the men at the head of our city 
government fail to realize is' that 
the majority of people need, more 
than spiritual recreation on Sun
day. They desire mental and 
aesthetic stimulation which they 
cannot get during the six working 
days of the week. Mr. Duffus ex
plains, The logic behind the op
position was simple and old-fash
ioned. People ought . not to be 
entertained on Sunday. They ought 
to think about their souls. They 
ought to be bored.
In his lasT criticism Mr. Duffus 
blames the city for failing to recog
nize local talent. He speaks of 
the immigrants who attend the art 
exhibits. Children of these immi
grant races come to Carnegie T ech 
to study the fine- arts, though if 
they show ability and are gifted 
with horse, sense they generally 
go somewhere else to practice 
them. At least they go sonlewhere 
else to' get a reputation. If they 
then come home with a New York 
or Parisian O: K. Pittsburgh is 
willing to look at their stuff." It 
is rather unfair to single out Pitts
burgh as unique in this fault. In 
any city a local artist gains a real 
reputation only after lie has been 
recognized elsewhere.
Mr, Duffus does not, however-,, 
see the situation as being beyond 
remedy. He believes that in time 
Pittsburgh culture will come into 
its own. Already progress is being
made in that direction. New
figures are coming up_ Edgar Kaufmann, son of a Jewish peddler, has 
just completed wliat is perhaps the 
most beautiful department s,tore in 
the United States, if not in the 
world. . . . Father Coakley has 
set a new standard for all de
nominations by his Church of the 
Sacred Heart.' Frank .Nicola long 
ago projected the beautiful Schenley Farms development, hear the 
park given to the city by Mrs. j
Mary E. Schenley some forty years 
ago. Pittsburghs newest bridges
have received awards for their aes
thetic merits.' Two boulevards 
going up the hills from the heart 
of the city afford picturesdUfe views 
of the valleys of the Monongahela 
and tlie Allegheny. He believes 
that A truly civilized Pittsburgh 
\yi 11 be built by the races they 
thought only good enough for the 
sweat arid dirt of the mills.
Apropos of the article discussed 
in last . weeks column concerning 
crime and corruption in Pittsburgh, 
it is interesting to note another 
bombardment aimed at our city 
not so severe as the first one but 
well worth consideration. The 
article referred to is the one by 
R. L. Duffus . in the Octobcr issue 
of Harpers entitled Is Pittsburgh 
Civilized? Immediately the answer 
comes back,  Of course Pittsburgh 
is civilized, and whats more, highly 
civilized. But the title is a bit 
misleading, for it is at.our lack 
of culture that Mr. Duffus aims 
his arrows of criticism. He sees us 
first as an overgrown machine 
town with our interest in indus
trialism overshadowing the other 
phases of life.
The city of Pittsburgh is a 
lurid example of that supreme 
paradox of the modern agethat 
our civilization rests upon coal and 
iron and that in almost every spot 
where coal' and iron are brought 
together civilization is blighted and 
begrimed. So it has been in that 
region which used to be called 
Merrie. England. So it is in West
ern Pennsylvania. The blight is 
not 'Pittsburghs alone. Pittsburgh 
is only a larger Braddock, Hom.e.- 
stcad, or McKeesport. From whatr 
ever direction one approaches the 
once lovely conjunction of the 
Allegheny and the Monongahela 
the devastation of progress is ap
parent. Quiet 'valleys have been 
inundated with slag, defaced with 
refuse, marred .by hideous build
ings. Streams have been polluted 
with sewage and the waste from 
the mills. Life for the majority 
of the population has been ren
dered unspeakably pinched and 
dingy. Too obviously the people 
have served the machines, not_the 
machines the people.
This constitutes Mr. Duffus first 
angle of attack. The second cause 
which lie cites lies in -the fact that 
there is aiv aristocracy of a certain 
religious sect in Pittsburgh whose 
straight-laced ideas have been a 
deciding factor in inhibiting the 
natural development of culture in 
the city. Pennsylvanias 'antique 
Blue Laws have proved an effective 
yoke in preventing the materializ
ing of the cultural ambitions and 
aspirations, of Pittsburghs masses. 
Mr. Duffus points out what are 
probably the two most outstanding 
instances, namely, the lending of 
books from the public library on 
Sunday, and Sunday concerts.

Hellow Folks!
Even our Carnegie co-eds are 
daily becoming more masculine 
than the males. In the official 
sophomore reception for incoming 
freshmen and freshwomen, which 
occurred last Tuesday noon, the 
girls received by far. the more 
vigorous reception. Long after 
the plebe men had run away from 
their welcomcrs, the war-painted 
armband-bearers toiled and per
spired. Its a good thing those 
Cwens didn't hive baseball bats 
instead of paddles.
One poor girl, exhausted after 
the calisthenics led by Kay Wholey, 
fled into the arms of Bud Murray, 
a bystander (as usual). The war
paint came off. Besides Bud, Frank 
Ellis (a math student, boys!) also 
carried traces of red and yellow 
around on his cheeks all day. He 
didnt get his in such a public 
way, however.
The idea of cataloging the 
plebe girls by signs around their 
necks was all right. The boys 
lining the sidewalks got lots of 
good numbers.
Were still wondering if K. L. 
Jessop heard what the boys be
hind her said when she told the 
plebe line to Beat it! From the 
way she reacted, she must have.
The Cwens were decked out in 
the brilliant ensemble they have 
lately affected. Wed be the last 
one in the world to, accuse the 
Cwens of anything out of the way, 
but we do know that the girl stu
dents in Ypsilanti, Michigan, are 
forbidden by the school authorities 
to wear red dresses on the cam
pus. Red is said to attract males. 
What do you think of that, M. 
Elizabeth McNary?
Carnegie is going air-minded! 
The gentleman who exhibited the 
glider on Flagstaff Hill, Friday 
afternoon, could have named his 
own price for rides. George Lafidgraf was the lucky one among the 
engineers. He was picked from 
the Aeronautical Seniors (not an 
inspiring group, to select from) to 
take a ride. Three times lie tried 
and was quite successful, except 
that he couldnt manage to get the 
landing wheel off the ground.
Elva Berg flew as the Margaret 
Morrison aviatrix, and damaged 
the glider with her head, on land
ing rather suddenly.
Bill Pfouts, the King of the Pat
tern shop, was offered a ride and 
was next seen in the Central 
Building, still going rapidly.
The two girls who recently in
vaded the mcsshall at Annapolis, 
thereby causing the permanent re
moval of two students, may find 
they have reversed the old order 
of things. Before long they may 
be crying to the irate parents, 
"Dont shoot, Ill marry your son!

Collegiate Chauvinism
There is one aspect of the under
graduate mind which is rather in
teresting, and I wrant to discuss it 
today under the title of Collegiate 
Chauvinism. By this, I mean a 
blind, uncritical, hyper - patriotic 
attitude when discussing the pro
fessors of ones own university 
when away from that university.
Go 'to Europe, go to an army 
camp, get a job on a construction 
gang, go anywhere in fact -where 
college boys, and girls congregate 
to have their long bull sessions in 
the middle of the night, and your 
conversations will run somethinglike this:
"Oh, hell, yes. I guess your 
brand of psychology is all right, 
but theres no doubt that Strumphelblittcrdorf at OUR school is 
the worlds leading authority. 
Huh, maybe, retorts - the Man 
from the East. But thats just 
one tiny branch  of psychology. 
For a guy wlios really ace high 
on any. kind of psychology, give me 
good old Prof. Stoncborough at 
OUR place. Hes keen, Im. telHng 
you. . .
And so , the talk ,.and argument 
goes on, and you laugh gloriously: 
to yourself, because you know that 
theyre all wrong, and that Dumpelpfeifer at your own school is 
really the big guy.1 
Now this is -really a good thing. 
The' average undergraduate is lack
ing enouglv-in reverence and.-respect 
toward hisprofessors. Listen in 
to an ardent argument, that is be
tween members of the same school, 
and you'll discover that their own 
professors arc monsters of 'ignor
ance. *

NIGHT. STUDENTSRegulations
Once again we are forced, to bring to the attention of the 
students the old cry of plebe regulations.. Either they should 
be enforced and enforced thoroughly or they should be put into 
discard for good. The necessity .for this editorial is evident 
after last weeks lamentable exhibition on the Cut.
The sophomore class, the men in particular, is to blame. 
A mere handful of second class men, most of them dressed 
too well to mix it turned out to open the yearly assault upon 
the plebes. The inevitable, of course, happened. The plebesi 
'broke and scattered in all directions leaving the bewildered 
sophomores to muster what few plebes remained into a half
hearted parade.
The sophomore women, especially the Cwens, performed 
their task very efficiently. ' To them ' go the laurels in an 
exceedingly poor demonstration of hazing as exhibited by the 
second year class. A little spunk w'ould be appreciated, soph
omores. Dont put on the nightcap until its time to retire.

Discrimination in Activities
With the opening of the school year, demands are immed
iately made upon the members of the freshman class .to partici
pate in every campus activity where use can be made of new 
recruits.
The average freshman comes to school wanting to make his 
mark, to become in terms of the vernacular, a big shot. To 
these young men and women we would like to say that engag
ing in activities promiscuously, is decidedly inadvisable. The 
scholastic demands made upon freshmen at Carnegie allow them 
time for one, or at the most two, extra-curricular activities. lie 
should .select these diseriminately arid make sure that he has 
more than a superficial knowledge of the work in which he 
wishes to engage.
i It is unjust to the leaders of an. activity to ask them for 
training, in their respective fields unless you are serious and 
conscientious in your intentions, and it is injudicious on the 
part of the freshman to imagine that he can manage competently 
an unlimited number of responsibilities.
An upperclassman receives the greatest amount of pleasure 
from holding successfully one or two important positions. To 
be recognizably capable in one field is obviously preferable to 
dabbling in so many that concentrated efforts can be given 
to no particular one of them.

Theres a diametric difference, in 
the explosive attitude regarding his 
professor when the undergraduate 
is in the sacredncss of his own 
fraternity house and when lies in 
the broadcasting arena of the rest 
of the world. Part of the feeling, 
of course, is due to the mysterious 
thing called School Spirit.
But another part can be explain
ed by a real appreciation. Remove 
the sophomoric derision complex 
which holds' on the average campus,

Student Council
The present Student Council has a task on its official 
shoulders even greater than that- which confronted last years 
group. Last year was fairly prosperous in that no loss was 
suffered, but the old. .debt from two j-ears ago still remains to 
be paid.
The new Council passed several resolutions at the conclu
sion of last year calling for the continuance of plebe regulations, 
the revival of the Science stag and a continuance of the Spring 
Festival. Two of these resolutions, if they are carried out, will 
react for the best interests of the school. . The Spring Festival 
can be, and should be, made profitable without curtailing any 
of the event's except, the Show, and that should be abolished 
anyway. Plebe regulations must necessarily be enforced or 
dropped completely, and as for the Science stagwell, it re
mains to be seen -if Council was really serious when it voted 
to revive that event. Perhaps it would be best if it wfere en
tirely forgotten or else elevated to a much higher plane than 
it formerly held..
To eliminate its debt should be Councils chief aim for 
the year but it cannot accomplish the task by itself. The man
agers of organizations,.of publications and the dance committees 
should give Council their' co-operation and all ought to be 
united in one single endeavorTo Clear that Debt.
