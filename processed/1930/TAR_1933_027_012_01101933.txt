Carnegie Head 
Urges Broad 
Study Course
Dr. Baker Says Engineers 
Need Knowledge 
Of Economics
EDUCATION SHOULD 
BROADEN ITS AIMS
jees En gi n e e r s Playing 
Important Part In 
Future Work
Excerpts from Dr. Bakers 
Speech on Page Three.
A broader basis for education 
in the United States was urged by 
Dr. Baker shortly before he sailed 
last Wednesday on the Hamburg 
liner New York to deliver a series 
of lectures in Germany.
In an interview with the New 
York Evening Post, he said that 
engineering courses should include 
more humanities and engineers 
must learn more of economics so 
that they may take from the bank
ers the function of deciding 
whether the projects they work 
out will pay when put into operation. Education in America, he
 [believes, must get away from the 
tendency to concentrate on prepar
ing individuals for a certain job 
, which they are to perform and 
must broaden its aims. Engineers 
will play a more important part in 
the future and for that will need 
a broader development. Research, 
he said, must be brought to bear 
scientifically on social, economic 
and political questions.
Aside from the lectures which 
Dr. Baker will give under the aus
pices of the Oberlander Trust of 
the Carl Schurz Foundation at the 
Universities of Hamburg, Berlin, 
Breslau, Koenigsberg, Goettingen, 
Heidelberg and Munich, he will 
speak on January 20 in Dalilem, 
Berlin, before the Kaiser Wilhelm 
Gesselschaft. His subjects will be 
the American Mind and The 
Significance of the United States 
fn.r in the Twentieth Cen
tury."

New Electrical 
Machines Added 
To Laboratories
s
During the past two weeks sev
eral new pieces of equipment have 
been added to the laboratories of 
the Department of Electrical En
gineering, which, according to 
Professor William R. Work, head 
of the department, should prove 
valuable both in the regular under
graduate and in special graduate 
studies.
A portable two-element oscillo
graph was recently purchased and 
installed, and a six-element oscillo
graph with a complete set of ac
cessories for visual and photo
graphic recording has been order
ed and will probably be in service 
within a month. This apparatus 
has an attachment for use in study
ing transient pheomena.
Another piece of apparatus pur
chased was a Fahy Simplex permeameter, which is of the tpye 
used exclusively in determining 
the magnetic properties of iron 
and steel both in mills and in the 
research laboratories of electrical 
manufacturing companies.
Important additions have been 
made to the high frequency lab
oratory. They include a shielded 
equal-ratio bridge of the Campbell-Shacltelton type and a Univer
sal bridge especially adapted to 
the measurement of inductances 
and capacitances at frequencies 
up to 50,000 cycles per second.

president of Student Council, rep
resented Carnegie.
Two sessions of open forum dis
cussions wore held daily. Such 
topics as paid athletes, student 
publications, cosmopolitan organi
zations, student government, and 
the honor system were dis

Technology and received a degree 
in 1922. For the next three years 
he was in charge of the Marine 
Design Division in the office of the 
Chief of Engineers in Washington. 
From 1925 to 1928 he was in New 
York City working on the improve
ments of rivers and harbors in the 
First New York Engineering Dis
trict. Following his work in New 
York he went to France again for 
three years with the American 
Battle Monuments Commission. 
Since his return to the United

AUTHOR GIVES UP 
ALL ROYALTY RIGHTS
Visit to America Provided 
Inspiration for Story; 
Will Open Tonight
By ROY MINET
Beginning tonight and continu
ing nightly until next Monday, ex
cept Sunday, the Department of 
Drama will present in the Little 
Theater The Virgin Goddess, 
under the direction of Prof. Ches
ter M. Wallace. The play is being 
given by special permission of its 
author, Mr. Rudolph Besier, who is 
best known for his play The Bar
retts of Wimpole Street.
This production is listed as one 
of the major offerings of the year. 
Nearly fifty students of the depart
ment take part in it.
Mr. Besier is generously permit
ting the department to produce 
The Virgin Goddess free of any 
royalties, and In addition, wishes 
the Department of Drama success 
in its production.
He relates that this play, his 
first, was written largely as a re
sult of a business trip to the 
United States. After completing 
his transactions in New York, Mr. 
Besier went to Algonquin Lake, 
Canada to escape the oppressive 
heat. The primitive beauty of 
that place moved Mr. Besier fco be
gin writing the play. Work on the 
play was not completed until after 
Mr. Besiers return to England, 
where he had it produced at the 
Adelphia Theater, London, in Octo
ber, 1906.
"The Virgin Goddess is a trag
edy, dignified of theme, swift of 
movement, and vigorous in its 
clash of passions. It marches un
swervingly to the sombre end 
within the space of one day and 
in one setting, thus bowing to the 
unities. The author introduces 
some variations from the severe 
classical form, however, which he 
uses to make his play modern in 
character.
The cast follows: Cresphontes

Sculpture Groups 
To Collaborate 
In Art Contest
The Alumni of the American 
Academy of Sculpturing in Rome 
are sponsoring a collaborative 
competition in sculpturing. The 
sculpturing department of the Col
lege of Fine Arts expects to enter 
about ten groups in this competi
tion, each team being composed of 
three students. The co-operation 
of three students in one team 
gives the student a chance to work 
out a problem where each con
tributes his ideas for the benefit of 
the group.
The students are now in the pre
liminary stages of the contest. All 
work will be completed by the lat
ter part'of February when it will 
be sent to New York to be judged 
along with work from other art 
schools in the country.
Last year an entry' from Car
negie won first place in this con
test; another won one of the sec
ond places. Two entries won first 
mention and four others won men
tion.

the sculpturing department re
ceived honorable mention in a 
competition sponsored by the 
Pittsburgh chapter of the Ameri
can Chemical Society for her de
sign of a medal to be used by the 
chapter as  an award for distin
guished contributions in the field 
of chemistry.
CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Dr. Webster Newton Jones, re
cently appointed Director of the 
Engineering School, was born at 
Rich Hill, Missouri. As a student 
at the University of Missouri, from 
which he received his A.B. and 
A.M. degrees, he was so much im
pressed with the knowledge, sym
pathy and enthusiasm of two of
____________________ his professors
that he plan
ned his educa
tion that he 
might after
wards teach. 
The following 
ten years he 
spent in grad
uate study 
and in teach
ing, meanwhile 
receiving his 
Ph.D. degree 
at Harvard 
U n 1 v ersity.
Perhaps from Dr. W. N. Jones Iove nf a(lven.
ture, he says. Dr. Jones taught 
from Maine to Montana.
During the war, Dr. Jones served 
in the Chemical Warfare Service, 
where he conducted research on 
Lewisite, the most toxic gas devel
oped. He served as chemical ex
pert on the War Trade Board, and 
now holds the commission of Ma
jor in the Chemical Warfare Serv
ice Reserve Corps.
In 1919, at the conclusion of the
war, Dr. Jones entered the J3. F. 
Goodrich Rubber Company as a re
search _ chemist. In 1925 he was 
placed in charge of the production 
chemical laboratories and the se
lection and training of young tech
nical men for the company. He 
was appointed technical superin
tendent of the processing division 
in 1927. Shortly afterward lie also 
took charge of the raw materials 
department, the physical testing 
and fabric laboratories, the cement 
and spreading departments, and 
the manufacture of chemicals.
Dr. Jones became general super
intendent of the processing divi
sion in 1928, with full responsibil
ity of all phases of the manufac
turing problems including technic
al, staff, and production activities 
of this division. For the one year 
preceding his coming here, the su
pervision of the manufacture of re
claimed rubber was added to his 
many other important duties.
His zest for personnel work and 
success in his selection of grad
uates is reflected in an article of 
his on the^ Selection and Training 
of Industrial Research Personnel, 
which treats the subject thorough
ly and in an interesting manner.
For diversion Dr. Jones enjoys 
playing all kinds of games; chess, 
contract and golf are among those 
he mentions. He is a nature-lover, 
and likes nothing better for a va
cation than to tramp through the 
Maine woods accompanied by a 
close friend.

Pi Delta Epsilon 
To Hold Dance 
On January 20
The Carnegie chapter of Pi 
Delta Epsilon, national journalistic 
honorary, is instituting a new tra
dition in holding the first annual 
Carnegie Publication Dance in 
Thistle Hall on Friday, January 20. 
This dance is open not only to men 
and women holding positions on 
college publications, but to all 
Carnegie students. The following 
committee lias been appointed to 
take charge of the dance: John
L. Kronenberg, general chairman; 
William Lazarus, James Stahl, 
and Robert Robinson.
The committee has already made 
plans for engaging a first-class or
chestra for the event. There is a 
possibility that the Daum-Sanderson Orchestra can be obtained for 
that evening. This Is the orches
tra that appeared here at the Anatole Thanksgiving Ball at the 
Hotel Schenley on Thanksgiving 
night.
The editors of all the campus 
publications including the Tartan, 
Puppet, Tri-Publications and This
tle, are backing this enterprise. 
The proceeds from this dance will 
help to defray the expenses in
volved in the annual high school 
journalistic contests, sponsored in 
Pittsburgh and vicinity by the Car
negie Chapter of PI Delta Epsilon.
Recall Coolidges 
Addresses Here
The death of former president, 
Calvin Coolidge, reminds many 
members of the faculty of the two 
addresses Mr. Coolidge made In 
the Carnegie Music Hall in com
memoration of Founder's Day in 
1921 and 1927.
In his first address he spoke as 
Vice President of tho United 
States, and in his second a Pres
ident. In the second address he 
elaborated on the history of Pitts
burgh and showed the part Andrew 
Carnegie played in making Pitts
burgh an educational as well as an 
industrial center.
The same statement that MrT 
Coolidge made about Carnegie may 
well be applied to himself: "He
was an intensely practical man.

Biennial Arts 
Ball Slated For 
February 17th
Life on Mars Theme 
Of Dance; Charles 
Dietz Chairman
Announcement has been made 
that the biennial Arts Ball will 
take place this year on Friday, 
February 17, under the supervision 
of a student committee of which 
Charles Le M. Dietz 34, is chair
man. In accordance with tradition, 
this largest of all social events 
sponsored by the College of Fine 
Arts will be held in the foyer of 
the College of Fine Arts.
The theme for tills years ball, 
life on the planet Mars, will af
ford unlimited opportunity for cre
ative design. Decorations will be 
unprecedented insofar as the motif 
for design is concerned because of 
the fact that heretofore a tradition 
or historical event comprised the 
theme and required imitative de
sign. This year the designers of 
the decorations must venture into 
the realm of the unknown. The 
problem of design has been offered 
to members of the Department of 
Architecture on a competitive 
basis, and all who submit solutions 
will be given scholastic credit on 
their work.
In order to. arouse enthusiasm 
over the Arts Ball, an informal 
meeting of the student body of 
the College of Fine Arts has been 
scheduled by the committee for to
morrow afternoon at 12:30 in the 
Little Theater. As usual, eligibil
ity will be strictly limited to reg
ularly enrolled day or night stu
dents of the college of Fine Arts 
or to any former student who had 
completed at least one semesters 
work in the College. The assess
ment has been noticeably lowored 
this year, the student rate being 
$3.50 and the alumni rate being 
$1.00.
The committee has already 
spent much time in planning for 
the affair. Members of the faculty 
have co-operated -splendidly with 
the commltee by offering helpful 
suggestions and expressing their 
willingness to attempt to eliminate

Lecturer to Present 
Javanese Island 
Screen Story 
PROGRAM PLANNED 
BY JR. HONORARY
Pictures Scheduled to Be 
Shown in Music Hall 
From 11:45 to 12:30
Burton Holmes, well - known! 
world traveler and lecturer, now 
appearing in Pittsburgh for his an
nual series of travelogues, will 
give one of his newest screen 
stories, Bali"The Last Paradise.* 
as the feature of the student as
sembly, arranged by Delta Skull, 
this morning in the Carnegie 
Music Hall. The program will 
start promptly at 11:45 and will 
end at 12:30.
Lecturing in the principal cities 
of this country for thirty-nine 
years, Burton Holmes lias gained 
wide recognition and an ever-in
creasing support from enthusiastic 
audiences. A pioneer in making 
travel films, noted for his beautiful 
color slides, he is regarded as one 
of the foremost travel lecturers of 
today.
The sci'een story to be given this 
morning, an entirely new trav
elogue prepared by Mr. Holmes for 
Ills current season, is based upon 
Ills observations in the Island of 
Ball in the Dutch West Indies. 
This island, just off tho coast of 
Java, is said by all observers to bo 
a veritablo falry-land. Isolated, a 
land apart from the modern world, 
It seems Indeod a suitable sotting 
for adventure. Its volcanos, Its 
sharp cliffs and Irregular coasts, 
Its abundant vegetation comblno 
to form a startling beauty un
touched by the onslaughts of civil
ization. Mr. Holmesi says, To 
our over-sophisticated, over-strain
ed senses, a visit to Ball Is lllco 
the peace of sunlight after shadow, 
cool water after thirst."
The Ballneso, left much to them*

For youll never realize how time 
has rolled until you don a pair of 
skates again and start -whirling 
around that oval. The party is 
scheduled for 7:30 oclock and if 
you leave when they turn the lights 
out at 9:00 youll have plenty of 
time to study. Remember, too, that 
W. A. A. is awarding ten points for 
all who participate in the event. 
Since this is the first opportunity 
that W. A. A. has given the Fresh
men to attend a roller-skating party 
there ought to be a big turn-out 
from that class. Well be seeing 
you, Freshmen.
The bowling season is almost 
over! Monnie Watters has ar
ranged a schedule for the tourna
ment to be held this week, and the 
winners will receive 100 points. All 
the information is on the Margaret

Competition Before 
Opening Meet
BY JOE BRONSON
The Carnegie Varsity Swimming 
Season will officially open with a 
meet at the University of Pitts
burgh on Friday, February 17. 
From all indications the swimming 
team is about equal to that of last 
year, but a changed and more dif
ficult program of meets makes 
forecasting of results a bit ardu
ous. The schedule takes the team 
to its first meet with N. Y. U., 
which supports a group of men 
who are heralded as experts in the 
aquatic sports.
The varsity swimmers are con
stitutionally nearly the same aa 
last year, having lost only Bill Ed' 
wards, versatile captain, and Tea 
Estabrook, who excelled in diving. 
The latter place has been success 
fully filled by Frank Jerge, who 
has returned to the school after a 
year of absence. The team is cap
tained this year by Norm Franlcey.
Throughout the season and be
fore the second semester begins 
the Tech varsity will receive com
petition in practice meets with the 
plebe swimmers," who are fast be
ing shaped into promising material. 
As a training principle the plebes 
have no official schedule, but limit 
their competitive activity to prac
tice meets. The varsity schedule 
is climaxed similar to last year 
with the Interscholastic Relays, an 
event of great and enduring inter
est. The schedule is shown be
low:
February 17Pitt, there.
February 24Western Reserve', 
here.
February 25Case, here.
March 3F. & M., there.
March 4N. Y. TJ., there.
April 8Fourth American Inter
scholastic Relays.
EACH YEAR, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING FOOTBALL SEASON, 
the ncwopapcrs arc literally filled with the rumored resignations, or 
the. aotual. resignations of various football coaches at different, colleges 
throughout the country, but heretofore these announcements have been 
of little concern to the Carnegie students. This year, however, it was a 
different story. The resignation of Bob Waddell as head coach of our 
football team was of vital' Interest to most of us, and has been the topic 
of'convcrtiation ever since. The resignation did not comc as a surprise 
to most of the men who were In the know around the institution, for 
they knew that in the past year or so the insurance business has been 
taking more and more of Waddells time and that sooner or later he 
would have to choose between tho two. He finally decided to give up 
coaching and now in his regular business we wish him every success 
in tho yvorld.
Carnegies sport fans tonight will 
get their first opportunity to see 
the 1933 edition of Max Hannums 
basketball team in action. The 
Temple Owls will furnish the op
position, and, judging from past en
counters with those pesky Phila-: 
delphians, the Tartans are expect
ed to have more than their hands 
full. The game, incidently, is a 
regularly scheduled game for the 
new eastern basktball conference; 
Pitt, Georgetown, and West Vir
ginia are the other members of the 
conference.
Temple took a 43-26 drubbing 
from Pitt Saturday evening, but 
this does not mean that the Cherry 
jersied courtmen can be counted 
upon to be a setup. They were hav
ing a very bad night against Pitt, 
and their shooting may be expected 
to improve considerably. A vic
tory over Temple would place the 
plaid warriors in a tie for first 
place with the Panthers from 
across the park.
Although Coach Hannum has not 
given out the starting lineup as 
yet, it is expected that Bobby 
Smith and Louie Blooey Jagnow 
will start at the forward posts, 
Stentz or Ewalt will jump center, 
and Fergus and Silverman or Riggs 
will handle the guard assignments.
Friday night the Tartans will 
again be in action on the home 
grounds when they encounter W. & 
J. The Prexies have lost two of 
their first three starts, but one of 
these games was with the strong 
Marquete team, which holds a de
cision over Notre Dame.
The squads three cripples, Jag
now, Fergus, and Silverman, were 
very much in evidence against 
West Virginia, and they should be 
back in their best form for these 
two games.______________________
Carnegie May 
Have Hockey 
This Season
Tartan Rifle 
Team To Be 
Chosen Soon
Facilities For Practice 
Encourage Athletes 
To Begin Sport
The chances of having an ice 
hockey team at Tech this year 
were aided considerably by the of
fer' of the Duquesne Garden Man
agement to allow the school to use 
the ice two days a week. The 
present plan is to have the candi
dates report two mornings a week. 
The ice is best for hockey in the 
morning but this time a]so pre
sents several difficulties. .Definite 
plans will be made soon and an
nouncements posted on the bulletin 
boards. If sufficient progress is 
made in a few weeks \ an attempt 
will be made to arrange a schedule.-
Last year a call was made for 
candidates > and several practices 
were held. Considerable enthusi
asm and some likely looking play
ers encouraged the Athletic Office 
to make another . attempt this 
year. Tom Coulter is an excellent 
player having received his training 
in Canada before he moved to 
Pittsburgh. - He is the leading 
spirit in the attempt to establish 
the sport.
Pitt and Duquesne are also en
deavoring to form a team which 
offers the chance of having some
Skibos to Take Part 
In National Assn 
Competition
A final placement match will be 
fired this week by all candidates 
for the varsity Rifle Team. This 
match will select a team for sectibnal, telegraphic and shoulder toshoulder meets which begin next 
week.
Again this year, Carnegie Tech. 
has entered the National Rifle As
sociation sectional and national 
conference matches. On February 
25, coach Sommer will take his 
team to Annapolis to shoot a 
match against the Midshipman 
team. Last year the Tartan 
shooters scored the highest of any 
opponents the Navy shot with, but 
were unable to win the meet! The 
Navy scored 1401 points against 
Carnegies. 1337.
Beginning on January 28, and 
running concurrently with the Na
tional Rifle- Association matches, 
telegraphic meets will be fired 
with thirty colleges in the United' 
States and Hawaii.

Miss Helen E. Wassail, M. M. 17, 
has perfected a new fatherless 
shaving cream under a Multiple 
Organic Synthesis felloAvsliip at 
the Mellon Institute, Pittsburgh.
Miss Wassell spent months in cos
metic research before discovering 
suitable shaving cream composi
tions. The first few compositions 
were distributed among the men at 
Mellon Institute for their opinions 
as to the merit of the - formulas. 
The texture and consistency of 
many of these early samples left 
much to be desired. By constant 
experimentation Miss Wassell ad
justed the cream until it met with 
popular approval. Samples were 
distributed among groups of men 
in Pittsburgh and New York, and 
the final formula was selected from 
the poll of their opinions.
Miss Wassell completed her ex
periment under an Industrial Fel
lowship from Kaufmamis Depart
ment Store, Pittsburgh, where the 
shaving cream is now on sale under the name Nodelay.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, JANUARY 10, 1933

---------------------------------------------------

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY. JANUARY 10, 1033
I noticed in the last copy of the 
Tartan I received that there -would 
not be an issue until next year so I 
commenced to lay down on the job. 
Then all of a sudden I was awaken
ed from my slumber by that pro
verbial alarm clockFather Time. 
I immediately realized that the pa
per was going to press and there 
would not be any material in it 
from your old sageThe Idle 
Night Student. Between you and 
tbe Senior fence that would be a 
calamity and a bludgeon on the 
spot of Carnegie, so I immediately 
got busy and penned some more of 
those sagacious writing for 'which 
yours truly is noted.
Here we are, back again after a 
long absence from the campus 
two long weeks of fun and merry
making when we tried to get in a 
whole year of entertainment. If 
you don't believe me, just glance 
back over the list of social affairs 
which were advertised for the un
suspecting students on vacation. 
The Anatole Club with its two big 
times at the Schenley, the InterCollegiate Ball at the Hotel Wil
liam Penn, The Southern Club 
Charity Ball, always a colorful af
fair, and many other parties, all did 
their part in entertaining the rest
less students.
The various fraternities and 
alumni groups also held parties and 
dances for their members in the 
different hotels and club houses. 
Even one of. the night school fra
ternities held a party at the Hotel 
Schenley. Certainly wish I could 
have been- there, for I am told 
they do hold very fine affairs. May
be some day I will be able to say, 
yes, I am a so and so man, but 
then, I will have to wait until I am 
asked.
While the season was intended 
to be bright and cheerful, the 
weather Gods treated us to any
thing but bright atmospheric con
ditions. Never saw such fog and 
dirt before. Seemed that every
thing was saturated with the de
pressing feeling which is all about 
us. I had to rub my eyes very 
often to see whether it was day 
time or night time. It was so hard 
to keep from getting ready to go to 
night school, habit you know, and 
I am a slave to habit. The London 
fog certainly had nothing on Pitts
burgh and this district.
Are you in the whirl or are you 
out of the whirl? You .dont know 
"That whirl well its the technoc
racy whirl. > Why every place I 
looked during the last -while back 
somebody was writing about this 
Franlcenstine. Its almost a by
word and, not to be outdone, some 
of the secret societies are using it 
for their pass word. Sounds big 
doesnt it? Well maybe it's as 
big as its small or as. small as its 
big. In other words, what is it all 
about? You ask one sage and he 
will tell you that, ahem, it is ... 
another one will.have this to say, 
. . .and still another one will vol
unteer that . . . represents what 
a technocrician really means to 
mankind. Boloney to you from 
one who knows but doesnt care 
how you feel is as good an answer 
for the sport as anything else. So 
thats this.
Ocracy, ocracy, ocracy, what does 
this all mean, where does it lead 
to, and when will it end? We know 
of democracy, hear of bureaucrocy, 
feel autocracy, etc., etc., et$., now 
let me add a few suggestions and 
maybe I will get my name in the 
papers. Why not have some pushocracy, sellocracy, Tech-ocracy,_and 
nightocracy and maybe we will get 
somewhere. I have it.
Lets start the new year with 
nightocracy and get busy with all 
our friends and get them interest
ed in Tecli-ocracyin other words 
the night school at C. I. T., is 
the best place to get an education 
and if you dont believe me ask any 
other night student and he will give 
you the same answer. So all for 
one and one for all, let us get out 
and show our friends that we real
ly have something to offer in the 
way of education. And then
Dance-ocracy, well, we have a 
dance scheduled for January 21 in 
the mens gymnasium which is 
sponsored by the Night Student 
Council. However, they dont need 
any ocracy to put their affairs over, 
they speak for themselves, but then 
if you want some real fun and 
pleasure you better arrange to be 
one of those present as yours truly 
intends to be. . . . That was the 
Idle Wight Student signing off until 
this time next week. The Tartan 
bids you all good night.

Far East Occupies 
Worlds Attention 
As Trouble Flares
The Sino-Japanese situation has 
again blazed into activity with the 
occupation of the Chinese city of 
Shankaiwan by the Japanese. The 
New Year seems to be starting off 
right for the alarmists and the 
militarists. The affair, in these 
days of mind everybody elses bus
iness, is apt to spread over the 
world in an alarmingly short time 
if not handled with tact and diplo
macy. It would seem, however, 
that tact cannot go far with the 
Japanese, who have adopted Napo
leons method of not taking advan
tage of situations, but of creating 
them. No one seems to have the 
necessary proof required to exact 
any promise of withdrawal from 
their dangerous methods of annex
ation, or perhaps the balance of 
the world feels that they are just 
looking for trouble and are best 
avoided. In any case, it is indeed 
depressing that the Chinese, who 
have been chiefly concerned with 
their own affairs ever ..since they 
were forced into contact with the 
outside world, and who have made 
every legal effort to stop the-in
roads of a jingo-led Japan, are at 
last forced to resort to practically 
open warfare to protect what -is 
theirs. Their pathetic efforts to 
gain their rights as members of 
the League of Nations have met 
with very little success! and were 
notably ineffectual during what has 
been termed the Shanghai affair. 
China Exploited 
Ever since the Chinese have had 
anything at all to do with the bal
ance of the world, they have seen 
their religion and customs under
mined, their country exploited by 
everyone, their cities patrolled by 
foreign troops, and now at last, 
are forced to Anally take up arms 
against the first nation that has 
been honest and frank about their 
robbery. The Japanese at - least 
deserve credit for being brutally 
frank. No one seems to be very 
deceived about their claims that 
they are merely protecting their 
own interests, and they do not 
seem to be particularly worried 
about whether or not anyone does 
believe them.
Situation Not Clear 
Perhaps there is more, behind 
all of the high-handedness than 
any Westerner can see. Popula
tion pressures, dangers of revolu
tion at home, ambitious leaders, 
and many other causes may be in
strumental in causing Japan to 
pursue her present coursc. With
out romanticizing one, little bit, 
the East is just as big a puzzle and 
worry as it ever was, and now that 
it has shown itself to contain 
really explosive possibilities, the 
West is noticeably chary about 
sticking its fingers in the pie, so 
to speak.. Funny what a difference 
it makes. The peaceful Chinese 
were told that their country must 
.necessarily be exploited by for
eigners, because the1 Chinese were 
either too torn by internal dissen
sion, or too peaceably inclined to 
object strenuously. But the Japa
nese, having a well armed and 
equipped army and a sizeable 
navy, both branches .having very 
capable leaders, is permitted to do 
pretty well as she pleases.
Passiveness Fails 
Perhaps China has learned that 
passive resistance is not the 
answer to her troublesome ques
tions, and the time has come when 
the example of the men of the 
Nineteenth Route Army who so 
bravely defended Shanghai against 
the invading Japanese is worthy of 
consideration. The men who died 
in the defense of Shanghai and 
Shankaiwan have not wasted their 
lives in a vain attempt to stem the 
impetuous flood of Japanese con
quest if their example will result 
in a binding together of at least 
the majority of the Chinese men 
of power in an effort to work to
gether until the time when the 
Japanese will be forced back to 
their island and their rightful pos
sessions, and Chinese can a'gain go 
back to tlieir simple lives of work
ing for what may be only a mere 
living, but which is of their choice. 
Perhaps, too, their land will! be 
freed at the same time of the large 
groups of unnecessary foreigners 
whose mother countries are very 
willing to protect the interests of 
their nationals, who are in China 
to make what they can honestly or 
otherwise, but whose same mother 
countries will let China go doAvn 
into oblivion in the final count 
rather than live up to the treaties 
that they have made previously. 
Perhaps the treaties were like so 
many other things that China has 
been fed by the outside world. 
Just promises, bags of wind, scraps 
of paper, calculated to lull Chinese 
suspicion into allowing their depre
dations to continue unnoticed, or 
at least unhampered.
Foreign trade is necessary, and 
commendable. Men of pther coun
tries must necessarily reside in far 
lands so that civilization may be 
supported in its luxuries. But it 
is not necessary that these outlanders should always represent a

Hop To Be Held 
In Gymnasium 
Jan. 7 By N.S.C.
Now that the holiday season is 
over for another year, w'e' have lit
tle else to do but settle, ourselves 
back into the routine -of school 
work that at times becomes a bitmonotonous. Mid-semester exams 
are staring us in the face and the 
thought is far from pleasant. As 
though to fortify our spirits for 
this ordeal comes the news that 
the Night Student Council is to 
hold another dance soon.
This news is welcome indeed and 
when January 21 comes around, for 
that is when the affair is sched
uled, we will find ourselves at the 
mens gymnasium dancing to the 
merry tune of a good orchestra. 
We may get caught on one of 
Zeros famous twisters or slip on 
a perfectly simple theory but we 
wont miss that dance. Am I right, 
or am I right? A dance may be 
just a dance, but a Night Student 
Council Dance is an event and any
body who would miss one wouldnt 
stop at stealing pennies out of a 
babys bank. Ah me! the Arts may 
do things for arts sake, the Indus
tries and Engineers for science's 
sake, but we all go to those Coun
cil dances for our own sake.
Just what arrangements are be
ing made, nobody wants to tell, 
but if past performances mean any
thing, you can bet your last nights 
sleep that it will be a BIG evening.
Dont forget January 7, the mens 
gymnasium, your best girl friend, 
or should I. say friend, will all go 
to make up a combination that 
means one of those real enjoyable 
evenings.
Proper Care Of 
Health Will Aid 
In Avoiding Ills
In view of the present near
epidemic of colds, psuedo-intiuenza, 
and various other of the illnesses 
that flesh is heir to, it seems fitting 
to remind the student body that 
they are only human too, irrespec
tive of what their department 
heads think. Many of the night 
students are working under a con
siderable strain due to shorthandedness at their places of employ
ment, and are therefore in such a 
physical condition that they are 
peculiarly susceptible to illnesses 
that are at all epidemic in their 
character.
The best way to be certain of 
good rating at the end of the term 
is not to overdo thiiigs. There is 
a possibility that your marks will 
be five per cent, or one grade, 
higher if you do, but there is also 
the possibility that you will be 
looking at the wrong end of next 
years turf if you permit overwork, 
lack  of care, or other factors to 
undermine your health.
The degree or diploma hasnt 
yet been awarded that is worth 
ruining one's health for, so it be
hooves everyone to realize that 
their health is the paramount con
sideration, after that, doing the 
best that can be done under the 
circumstances is all that anyone 
can expect. Dont forget that a 
week lost from .class will set you 
back farther than slowing up suf
ficiently to make up the difference 
between being pleasantly busy, or 
being overworked. This isnt ex
pected to be an opening wedge 
for an anti-work campaign, it is 
merely a suggestion that the stu
dents take  all precautions possi
ble to keep in trim.
Present Situations 
Alter Viewpoint
The holiday season is past now, 
and, considering everything, it was 
a big success. In spite of the de
pression, the pubic seemed to 
make the most of what they had, 
and while economy was the key
note of all .programs, a good time 
was apparently had by all. The 
general enjoyment of the season 
by the average family appears to 
be an indication of the fact that 
the Christmas spirit is one that 
cannot be broken, even by Old Man 
Depression.
Curtailed incomes considerably 
lightened expenditures, as was 
obvious from the glum looks- of 
those in charge of large stores. 
Smaller and less expensive items 
were the order of the day, and 
large quantities of these lower 
priced goods were absorbed by the 
buying .public.
One of the brightest spots seen 
during this extended depression Is 
the realization of many people that 
a splendid time can be had by any
one at considerably smaller cost 
than was thought necessary in 
1929. The greater appreciation of 
the smaller things in life, of old 
traditions forgotten during pros
perous times, the .revival of many 
old customs, and the generally in
creased tendency to spend the holi
days at home, all contributed their 
part to making the season more 
enjoyable than was thought possi
ble by many.
Perhaps the present economic 
conditions will teach us more les
sons on how to enjoy life on very 
little. At any rate, the past festivi
ties have taught many of us that 
the little things in life, accepted as 
incidentals before, are the real 
basis of happiness, when all the 
tinsel is taken off our methods of 
doing things.' May this realization 
help to make 1933 a really happy 
and prosperous New Year.
The 61-year old ban on dancing 
at Ohio Northern University was 
removed, and the college recently 
held its first dance since 1871.

resultant death and destruction of 
their fellow-citizens and their 
property.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT an epidemic of school 
spirit or something has hit the 
night campus. Witness the 
Plaid Ties being worn by some 
of our best-citizens.
THfT it was a tough job get
ting back into the harness after 
that swell vacation. Hope the 
holiday spirits were kind to you 
all.
THAT the end of the first se
mester is just around the cor
ner, not the one prosperity is 
around either. Excuse me,
please, but lets talk about 
something else. I would rather 
not think of what that means.
THAT the Council is going to 
hold another big dance next 
week and believe you me it will 
be as welcome as a spring rain 
coming as it does just before 
the semester call to arms.
THAT some faculty members 
are no doubt chuckling to them
selves as they contemplate the 
coming slaughter of the inno
cent.
THAT winter may come and 
winter may go but the fog stays 
on forever.
THAT even if congress didn't 
give us beer by Christmas some 
people provided for themselves 
anyhow, just in case of snake 
bites you know.
THAT by this time some of 
those good New Year resolu
tions we made have withstood 
the acid test and are getting 
along very nicely, thank you. 
The same to you, you big false 
alarm.
THAT that's that and Ill be 
seenya.
Students Requested To 
Send In Ticket Returns
There are still a number of 
ticket returns to be made for the 
Thanksgiving Recess Dance held 
by the Night Student Council on 
November 25. Points for the insig
nia award cannot be credited until 
these returns are made and it 
would be appreciated if those who 
have not reported on the sales did 
so at once. Send returns to John 
F. Simpson, Treasurer, Night Stu
dent Council, Box 137, C. I. T., 
Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Evidence of Turn 
For Better Seen
At the threshold of the New 
Year, it is superfluous to look back 
on the past three hundred and 
sixty-five days and lament their 
cruel disappointments, such as 
many of us experienced. It would 
also be silly to attempt to prove 
that 1932 wasnt as bad as it was 
painted. The thing to do at this 
time is to consider the possibilities 
of promise during 1933.
Big business admits hopefully 
that a movement upward has com
menced, a.small, slow start it. is 
true, but a beginning. Many, too, 
feel that conditions in general will 
brighten considerably after the na
tions business men have had a 
chance to find out the plans of the 
president-elect, so that they may 
chart their courses accordingly. 
The general public is bearing up 
wonderfully well under the circum
stance, in fact, although general 
optimism is lacking, pessimism on 
a large scale is lacking, too. A 
grim, dogged determination to 
carry on, and a fighting spirit of 
commendable strength seem to be 
prevalent, not of necessity, in 
which there is virtue, but because 
of a natural stlck-to-ltiveness inher
ent in the average American.
One of the French generals dur
ing the war, after  'receiving dis
patches to tho effect that his wings 
were turned and Ills center was 
falling back exclaimed, "The mo
ment is auspicious. Let us at
tack! The battle ended in favor 
of the French. Lets try to imitate 
the old generals lack of despair, 
and push forward, if not to our old 
levels of prosperity, to the point 
where even you have a job, enough 
to eat, and a happier outlook on 
life.

Merritt Haynes 
Is To Address 
Printers Today
The United Typothetae(of Amer
ica lPcture series for the current 
year, sponsored by the Department 
of Printing, will open today with 
an address ' by Mr. Merritt W. 
Haynes on Type Makiiig." All in
terested persons are invited to at
tend the meeting which will be 
held in Room 251 of the College of 
Industries at 3:30 this afternoon.
Since 1925 Mr. Haynes has been 
with the Education Department of 
the American Type Founders 
Company of Jersey City, N. J., as 
specialist in printing. Previous to 
that time he was in the Education 
Department of the United Typotliatae of America. He is now 
also a part-time instructor in the 
Vocational Teachers Training 
Courses conducted, in New York 
City by the New York State Divi
sion of Vocational Education. Mr. 
Haynes is the author of Teaching 
Shopwork published in 1924 and 
the compiler of Students History 
of Printing. He also initiated 
and edited The Printing Instruc
tor which is now known as 
Printing Education.
The American Type Founders 
Company is the largest company 
in the world engaged in the pro
duction of printing types. Mr. 
Haynes will talk about modern 
processes which are used in the 
plant.
The Department of Printing will 
in the near future issue the Direc
tory Number of the United Typotlietae of America periodical, 
Printing Education. The issue 
will contain a list of 1;200 depart
ments of printing in schools in the 
United States and European coun
tries, and a list of 2,070 teachers of 
printing and educational supervi
sors of printing in the city of Pitts
burgh and the surrounding district.
Urges Payment Of 
Debts As Aid T 
Nations Distress
One of those cases which drive 
the diplomats to strong drink and 
burlesque shows is now creating 
quite a turmoil in official circles. 
To pay. or not to pay? Europe is 
all of a bib and tucker about this 
all-important question. It would 
seem that they have studied Amer
ican business methods and applied 
them to politics, especially in re
gard, to war loans. Um, lets see, 
there was a war sometime ago, we 
forget just when, it was so long 
ago, and someone borrowed some 
money from our great and glorious 
republic. Has any ono the papers 
to prove It? They have? Well, 
whats the big argument then?
Just this. The European cred
itors of the United States have al
ways received payment of their 
drafts and due bills right at tho 
date specified, if not earlier. They 
seem to think that this is no way 
to support a sound financial inter
national system, so they have de
vised a substitute, namely, dont 
ever pay your bills, If you can get 
out of it. But how to get out oC 
it? That was easy. One merely 
threatens to default. This threat 
is intended to cause your creditor 
to reflect upon your sad financial 
condition, and then write you a 
letter telling you that it was all In 
fun, and that you wont need to 
pay. Unfortunately, Congress and 
the President didnt seem to be 
impressed that way. Naturally, we 
are regarded as a lot of old 
meanies, but just think how nice 
all that money would look in the 
Treasury.
Payment Depends On Viewpoint
Perhaps there are good reasons 
why Europe should not pay at the 
present time, from their point of 
view. But it was the American 
taxpayer's money that was loaned. 
He needs it now to run his Govern
ment efficiently, economically, and 
without impairing its credit. Lets 
hope he gets it.
If it could be definitely shown 
that non-payment would definitely 
relieve the economic pressure that 
is throttling the entire world at 
present, it would be one thing. 
But this exposition is lacking. The 
benefits advanced by the debtor na
tions are just as obscure as their 
promises to pay. So why not give 
the American citizen the actual 
proved advantage of a balanced 
budget, rather than take chances 
with some Bonanza proposition 
tlia.t is apt to fizzle out like an oil 
well project and leave us holding 
the sack for the rest of time?

CHARLES A. DANA
TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1933
Dr. Thomas S. Baker,' president 
of Carnegie, in a Spoech titled, 
The Significance of the United 
States for Europe in the Tweutieth 
Century, delivered lust Saturday 
in the Hamburg Union, Hamburg, 
Germany, said that national prog
ress in the future will depend 
upon a closer association of na
tions.
The Atlantic has grown narrow 
and the Pacific is shrinking. We 
Americans would like to devote all 
our abounding energy to the de
velopment of our richly endowed 
country, but the harder we work 
to achieve industrial independence 
and economic greatness, the more 
inevitable becomes our association 
with and our dependence upon 
other nations. That is to say, the 
more industrious and energetic 
and resourceful we are, the greater 
becomes our productive power and 
the greater the surplus of com
modities, which we must offer to 
other countries. Undisturbed by 
national rivalries in our vast sec
tor of the American continent, our 
industrial progress proceeds with 
few interruptions. As our econ
omic power increases, our signifi
cance as a world state will neces-: 
sarily follow in its train. We 
should prefer to remain isolated; 
but we cannot escape our destiny 
as a commercial, social and politi
cal force in the affairs of the 
world, lie said in the opening 
part of his speech.
Dr. Baker compared the United 
States in its relation to Europe 
with a wandering son who set out. 
from home to' seek his fortune and 
For a long time, only- vague and 
irregular reports are heard of the' 
doings of the wanderer. The tie 
with the home lands becomes 
weaker through, the years. Final
ly, however, word comes that the 
lialL-forgotten colonist has made 
Ills fortune and Is now a rich mem
ber of the family. The old rela
tionship which Had been allowed 
to weaken, or oven to lapse, is re
called, Is insisted upon . . . The 
wanderer is told how lie can and 
how he ought to help the home 
lands . . .his idiosyncrasies niust 
be tolerated, Ids eccentricities 
must be condoned, because he Is 
now the newly dlscovei'od rich 
uncle In the family of nations.
I see two forces at work, Dr. 
Baker said in advancing tho re
sults that will follow when Europe 
and the United States are brought 
in intimate contact with oacli 
other, in a sense .contradictory or 
conflictingboth of which are a 
consequence of tho shortening of 
distances, of the narrowing of tho 
oceans. First, tho bringing of na
tions together in a physical sonso 
may create or produeo moro oppor
tunities for misunderstanding. 
Tho prossuro that contracts the 
world puts into bold rollel' racial 
differences. As a result of the ap
pearance of tlicv United Stales in 
the European* sphere, America is 
the occasion of much moro fault 
finding than whon she Avas remote. 
Propinquity does not necessarily 
make for units.
But a second tondoucy Is to ho 
observed.' As science accolorated 
the speed of communication, the 
exciiango of Idoas becomes moro

nationalizing Influence.
The boundaries of nationalism 
will tend to disappear first In the 
sphere of the mind, lator in the 
field of businoss or economics, and 
last of all in the realm of politics.
T11 speaking of tho factors, that 
will tend to encumber the process 
of internationalism, President 
Baker said, There is a national 
reality, a national spirit based on 
centuries of accomplishments and 
traditions which will yield only 
slowly to any movement In the di
rection of a synthetic world point 
of view ... The highest expres
sions of a civilization are indi

business men who silently and un-A<fTriyr? c 
consciously are promoting internationalism. A world state is a 
long, long way off; but the inter
nationalizing of many, one' might 
say most, phases of human exist
ence is inevitable. Political unity,
I say, is remote; but is it not true 
that through the narrowing of the 
oceans, the bringing of nations 
closer together in a physical sense, 
peace has become moro necessary 
because war has become more dan
gerous?
We might debate the question, 
Will Europe ultimately resemble 
the United States or will the Unit
ed States resemble Europe?  Dr. 
Baker said concluding a discussion 
of the Americanization-of Europe, 
I think we are playing with words. 
It is an exaggeration to speak of 
Americanizing Europe and it is 
very debatable whether the United 
States will bo Europoanized. It is 
safer to assume that in spito of th 
growth of tho nationalistic spirit, 
in recent years there is a continual 
progress toward what may be. 
called a world psychologytoward 
a greater uniformity in tho manlier 
of living and thinking throughout 
tho world. The influence of demo
cratic ideas has been extonded and 
has brought with It as increased 
power of tho masses to makct tholr 
wishes known and felt in all coun
tries.
President Baker declared \ln op

United St.ntes is an imperialistic 
nation, We can hardly believe that,

rlence and sue;Cartrtgio Trhe Football SituationThe, At 
coach ban. .Tnsoi, acuts and alumni oi: Carnegie regret to see the 
passing oJ: tfi'G names oi! Coaches Waddell, and-Steffen from the 
roster oJ! coaelies after, their many years of service to the insti
tution. Coach Waddell will retire to a business life, while 
Judge Steffen will nerve on Carnegie .H Football Advisory 
Board.
During the time which they have been at Carnegie the 
unique system of coaching under which: these men worked lias 
attracted nation-wide attention. But like most things, there 
comes a time when a change is inevitable. Under the system 
of graduate coaching to be inaugurated next fall, headed by 
All-American Howard Harpster who was tutored by the two 
retiring coaches, it will be interesting to see what new hands 
and a new system can do with the football situation at Car
negie. The new coaches have a difficult job on their hands in
asmuch as they will be the objects of skeptical eyes.
During the past few years, the players have apparently 
lacked sufficient training in fundamentals so necessary as a 
part of the training of a co-ordinated group of players. This 
can be attributed partly to the system of coaching and the lack 
of personnel on the coaching staff. The most successful coach
ing systems developed in x*ecent years require several line 
coaches, who can work with the lines of three or four teams at 
one time, and as many backiield coaches. These coaches are 
headed by one man who has undisputed authority. The system 
which Carnegie lias had in the past would never have been Suc
cessful had it not been for the fine co-operation of Coaches 
Waddell and Steffena co-operation which probably could not 
have existed between any two other men.
Some of the most successful teams in the country have been 
trained by the use of running boxes, tackling dummies, and 
other devices declared necessary by many coaches. The more 
a runner is trained to cross-step, sidestep, and reverse his 
ilcld by means ol! improvised devices and exorcises, the more 
automatic those actions become on the playing field. A com
petent staff of coaches who will give individual attention to 
every member on the squad should be able to develop sure 
tacklers and good blockers.
One ol! the criticisms of the past season is that some mem
bers ol! the squad have not boon given an opportunity to dis
play their worth in actual competition. 01!i;en the ambitious 
sub will play a better game than the sometimes nono-too-eoneerned regular.
The new coaches have the problem of developing a now 
system and producing a team which will play as consistently 
as this year's team did in the Pitt or the Georgetown games.
THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
Technocracy, war debt, "Buy 
American and many other 
plmuioii which have boon on the 
lips of many ol! the citizen oil the 
United StatOH during, the lust part 
of the pant year are now on tho 
lipB ol! many more people. This 
may he duo to tho almost phonomeual rise ol! interest in the 
plans of the Technocrats, a group 
which was almost unheard of not 
so many weeks ago. Although 
they themselves they have not 
published much material, there 
has been a great deal ol! material 
written by economists and political 
writers. The very fact that so 
many economists are not in favor 
of the plan must show that it has 
a definite structure, otherwise they 
would not even bother with it.
One must give the Technocrats 
credit for having taken the initia
tive, in showing this country just 
how it stands. While manufac
turers, salesmen and business ex
ecutives are hoping for some type 
of a miracle, the Technocrats are 
attempting to get down to the 
fundamental ailment from which 
the world is suffering. Neverthe
less it seems fairly obvious that 
any one who tries to pass judge
ment on a plan which has not boon 
complotoly explained as yet by Its 
authors Is not giving himself or 
tho plan a fair chance. .In the 
near future tho Technocrats will 
publish the remainder of their 
doctrine; then thoro will thou bo 
plenty of time for criticism. It Is 
wise to keep In mind that hoping 
will never end tho depression.
Tho Big Stick Leaver,
On January 2 tho last, troop of 
American Marines loft; Nicaragua, 
ending our Big Stick" policy in 
that, country. The job of keeping 
peace in Nicaragua has boon turn
ed over to tho natives who wore 
trained for their duties by tho 
marinos. This National Guard, or 
Giiardia Nacional as It is called, 
is composed of 2,500 men. The 
United States hopes that it will 
not need to once more take up its 
foreign policy in Nicaragua. If 
howevei\ the conditions are such 
that American investments will 
again be in danger, the marines 
will still be on hand and will once 
more be sent hack to maintain 
peace.
Two Extraditions Fail 
Samuel Insull, one of the great
est exponents of the intrigues and
complications ol! modern big busi
ness and mergers, was recently 
saved from tho omlmrassmont, to 
put it mildly, of facing omboz/.lomont and larceny charges before 
Chicago courts when the Athens 
(Greece) Court of Appeals refus
ed to return him to the United 
States. Mr. Insulls trial, should 
it be held, might prove fatal to cer
tain American bankers whose un
stable condition would be revealed 
during the trial.
Robert E. Burns, whose name 
was thrust before readers of tlie 
American . press during his battle 
with the extradition laws in his at
tempt to save himself from being 
returned to the Georgia chain-gang, 
was finally guaranteed his free
dom by the state of New Jersey 
through Governor Moore of that 
state, who refused to return him 
to Georgia. There is a great deal 
of argument as to whether or not 
the conditions which he lias de
scribed in his book, I Am A Fugi
tive From a Georgia Chain Gang, 
and depicted in motion picture pro
duction are true. The state of 
Georgia does not deny the ex
istence of certain conditions but 
does, however, put a defense for 
her prison system. Governor Rus
sel of Georgia says that in many 
cases Georgia prisons are far su
perior to those In the North.
Pre-Civil War 
Art Exhibition 
Will Continue
An exhibition of paintings by 
David G. Blythe, painter and 
craftsman of pre-Clvll War times, 
opened on December 22 in the gal
larles of Carnegie Institute and 
will continue until January 31. 
The exhibition includes forty-one 
of Mr. Blythes works, portraits 
and general subjects, lent to the 
Department of Fine Arts of Carne
gie Institute by their owners.
Mr. Blythe, known In ills day as 
the Hogarth of America, was born 
In East Liverpool, Ohio, May 9, 
1815. His early years were spent 
at the Blythe homestead on Lis
bon Road. He was a quiet, 
bookish, rather eccentric youth, 
who, without any training, was 
able to dash off a striking likeness 
of an Individual either at sight or 
from memory.
At the age of fifteen, he came to 
the firm of Joseph Woodwell in 
Pittsburgh to learn the trade of 
woodcarvlng. I-Ie led the life of 
a painter at East Liverpool from 
1840 until about 1845, at which 
time he sttled definitely in Uniontown to make carvings and to 
paint portraits. During his resi
dence at Uniontown he painted a 
panorama of tho National Pike, a 
canvas six or eight feet in height 
and several hundred feet long.
Blythe also had a literary turn 
of mind, writing under the signa
ture, "Boots." Although out
spoken, fearless, and of great in
dependence of character, he was a 
man of fine feeling, sympathy, and 
understanding; although eccentric 
In many ways, he wus also one of 
the most companionable and so
ciable "of men, as indicated by his 
position among fellow artists in 
Pittsburgh and the welcome lie re
ceived at "mess" in Civil War 
camps during his three months 
service.
Blythe died, after a lingering ill
ness, at the Passavant Hospital on 
May 15, 18G5. He was buried 
first in the old Fifth Street -Ceme
tery, East Liverpool, and, when 
this cemetery was abandoned, his 
remains were removed to the 
Spring Grove Cemetery on the 
snot which orginlally was the 
"Gods Acre" of the Blythe farm.
The high regard in which Blythe 
was held in Pittsburgh, the city of 
Ills adoption, and the care with 
which even his slightest sketches 
have been preserved and handed 
Alown as precious heritages are 
evidences that Pittsburgh in its 
pre-Civil War times was awarethat she was entertaining a genius.

George Washington University 
lias a club known as the Wan
dering Greeks, being made up of 
fraternity men who have trans
ferred from other schools and who 
belong to a fraternity not repre
sented at George Washington U.
Every fraternity house has at least one! The 
chief cut up at the Theta XI house is none other 
than Sam Bond, with Joe Bronson as chief as
sistant. The hoys singled out poor Charley Ap
plegate as the victim the other night. It seems 
that Charley has a way of getting settled in the 
telephone booth early in the evening and lasting 
asi none of the 
other brothers 
can. This 
seems to an
noy some ofthe brothers 
who have a 
habit of prom
ising to call 
at some fixed 
time, and Joe 
and Sam took it upon themselves to blast Char
ley loose the other night. Heres what happened.
Mr. Bond is no ordinary prankster but believes 
in doing things right. For just such an occasion he 
has a ready supply of accessories such as noisemakers, Roman candleB, fire crackers, etc. Mr. 
Bronson got permission to use the arsenals big
gest cannon cracker and slipped it under the 
door with the fuse sputtering vociferously. The 
resultant explosion, however, didnt even phase 
the talkative Mr. Applegate. This was too much 
for the hitherto successful Mr. Bond and off he 
went for a whole string of dynamite crackers. 
Upon his return, he slipped them under the door, 
but in doing so, they became deranged and re
fused to react. Undaunted, Sam fished them back 
through the crack and withdrew to make the 
necessary repairs. Fearing that his previous ef
forts might have aroused suspicion, shoes were 
removed and a most cautious approach made.
The resulting explosion sounded like a minia
ture movie war, and there, could be no doubt that 
the enemy would evacuate. The jubilant Mr. 
Bond hastened up the stairs to join the boys in 
the hall and play innocent as the battle-scared 
Mr. Applegate ascended, but low and behold, there 
stood Charley at the top of the stairs grinning as 
only Charley can. Even to this day he claims 
the explosion sent him through the roof. *****
THAT VACATION
The closing of school was celebrated with what 
certainly appeared to be an All-Carnegie night at 
the Chatterbox Friday night. The Dragons, the 
Beta Pis, a couple of S. A. E. boys, a stray Alpha 
Kap pledge, a was-to-liave-been-married co-ed, and 
a couple of the Puppets outstanding columnists 
were on hand.
Imagine! Jimmy Joy, when lie announced that 
a couple of Carnegie organizations were there, 
mentioned the Beta Pis before the Dragons. 
Everybody wound up the evening singing Fight 
for the Glory of Carnegie, trying to dance at the 
same time.
All of Carnegie that was within striking dis
tance of Pittsburgh showed up for the Inter
collegiate Ball, which, despite newspaper reports 
to the contrary, was a very mild affair in com
parison to other years. Rudy proved lie knew liis 
stufT by playing Carnegie songs before those of 
Pitt and Duquesne in Ills college medley. The 
star of the evening, however, was none other 
than our own Mary Dingfelder, who stopped the 
show when she sang with the Connecticut Yan
kees. Running her a close race for honors was 
Linn Holveck, who got the distinguished Mr. 
Vallee to make the following announcement for 
them: Will tlie person that has this gentle
mans tuxedo please come forward? He says he 
will be glad to exchange with him.
It would be pretty hard to account for every
body New Years Eve. Anyhow, Tom Hower was 
the only person we heard say he had a flat tire 
on a date that night.* . * * * *
The plebes turned out en masse to make the 
Freshman-All Carnegie a big success. Zombie 
and his whole crew were on hand. The Baron 
rose to the occasion and handled the extra num
ber of hats and coats In a masterful manner. 
While everyone was there here are some couples 
worthy of mention, Bill Holliday and Marian 
Jones formed one of the few all plebe dance 
teams. Bob Fischer and Jane Beck comprised 
another, but one of the most interesting couples 
involved a junior. You know the one thats going 
to lead the Womens Junior Prom. Uh.Jiuli, Mr. 
Hughes and Miss Farrell. No, this is not a mis
print, but you really should know that the Theta 
Xis had initiation that night.*****
MR. AND MRS.
Over at Forbes Hall the girls have trouble find
ing things to talk about at the dinner table (it 
is probably deathly quiet now that Peg Weidlein and Peg Moran are on a diet}, and so now 
they have taken to playing games. As is alto
gether fitting and proper for romantic young 
souls of college age, the first game was that of 
choosing the 
ideal husband 
the one man 
that each 
thought would 
make the per
fect life part
ner. Imogene 
Patterson, as 
might have 
been expect
ed, chose Mid Zoller and Kitty Lou Jessup 
wasnt sure but she guessed maybe a fellow 
from town here would do O. K., and Reba Wag
goner mentioned George Goodridge, but on secand thought said the boy back home in Harris
burg might be better (wonder if shes heard). 
Then only the two Pegs were left. Miss Moran 
failed to falter and blurted it right out, one famed 
red head, but Miss Weidlein sighed before she 
could pronounce it, another red head, Colin 
Stewart.
We'll be seen you, but if you dont see me first, . 
you wont.*****
FIRST BASKETBALL DANCE
Last Saturday night The Virginians inaugurated 
the annual series of Thistle Hall basketball 
dances. Many of the old timers were on hand: 
Bob Robertson and Becky Linn, Tom Coulter and 
Elizabeth Carlin, Jack Stone, Bob Beatty, Emil 
Stanlcey and Margy Griffen', and Bill Uffleman. 
The other Saturday night standbys turned out in 
full force. The Tau Beta PI banquet was the 
evenings prelim. The second dance of the se
ries comes this Saturday with Dick Gaertner and 
his orchestra furnishing the music.
Long ago but not so far away. In fact it's Carnegie In the good 
old days of 1910. Of course we recognize the Kiltie Band or perhaps 
those are the Maggie Murphs doing the Highland Fling. Just notice 
the cheering section. But where are the men? Not even a dormitory 
in sight. The white building is the old field house before it was re
modeled as the Carnegie Inn. Down at the left is the Carnegie Bowl. 
The house in the center is probably a fraternity house. Who knows?
Dean Joseph Bursley of the Uni
versity of Michigan urges students 
not to starve for a college edu
cation. He says that campus at
tics are filled with starving stu
dents, and a college education 
isnt worth it. Such sacrifices, 
such struggles to make both ends 
meet leaves a mental and physical 
scar.
Some people believe in traveling 
for an education. Over two-thirds 
of the students enrolled at the Uni
versity of Paris are Americans.

Graduating from high school, I

Do the excess profits go to the

I would urge every one to buy. But, 
if the excess profits go to a private

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
Current in our newspapers are 
special features and mental exer
cises,-such as puzzles and crypto
grams, which dispel in an inex
pensive way the tedium of the long 
winter evenings. They are en
joyed in place of the expensive 
cinema, play, or danceand are a 
suitable substitute in this period 
of economic stress when the aver
age budget has no provisions for 
the so-called non-essentials.
As a part of this feature pro
gram, the newspapers have been 
calling upon those interested in 
thought expression of one kind or 
another to formulate lists of the 
ten most pleasant words. These 
mellifluersa barbarous coinage 
from the legitimate mellifluous 
meaning sweetly or smoothly flow
inghave been selecting their 
words that convey thought in a 
sweetly and smoothly flowing man
ner with a double standard In 
mind: the expressed sound of the 
letters combined in the word, ana 
the implied meaning or suggestion 
that the words call to the mind. 
For example, the onomatopoetic 
whirl has a smoothness and a 
sweetness that make for melodious . 
pleasure when it is spoken; 
whereas mother, while it may 
convey this delight in sound when 
it is enunciated, probably gives 
more mental enjoyment because 
of the pleasurable associations that 
it recalls.
The pleasure in the, sound of a 
word is suitable for all writers and 
speakers to consider. It is valued 
by poets who have a care for the 
euphony of their verse, especially 
since good rhythm should not be 
interrupted by jarring or harsh
ness.
But in the matters of tlie denota
tion or the connotation of words 
there should be even more general 
concei-n. For the fuller command 
of the powers of thought ex
pression every student of language 
composition should be acquainted 
with both what the words in his 
vocabulary mean and what  they 
suggest or imply. In the former, 
the denotative value of a word, the 
barest definition of the idea, is 
conveyed. For example, mother 
means female parentin which 
since it would hardly be selected 
as-.One of any list of pleasant 
wor.ds. But in its connotative or 
implied meaning the word contains 
much more. It is associated with 
such ideasone might call them 
overtonesas tenderness, love, old, 
unselfishness, sincerity, home. 
With these helps mother be
comes a composite idea, the recol
lection and expression of which 
are .very agreeable.

6 oclock means nothing 
to telephone service!
Bell System service must go on all the time. Day 
and night, Sundays and holidays, it must handle 
with speed and accuracy not only the usual traffic 
but also the unexpected rush of calls.
To meet this obligation, Bell System men tackle 
problems of many kinds. At Bell Telephone 
Laboratories, scientists develop new kinds of 
apparatus. At Western Electric, engineers find 
ways to make telephones, switchboards and cable 
more and more reliable. In the telephone com
panies, traffic engineers devise improved operating 
methods that make service faster, more accurate, 
more dependable.
Result: at noon or in the dead of night, the 
public reaches confidently for the telephone, 
knowing that Bell System service never stops.
