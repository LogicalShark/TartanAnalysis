Bell Tower Discussion 
Renewed by 'C6unc.il
Idea for Tower First Conceived by Prof. Wurts; 
Charles F. Slater 35, Submits Winning Design; 
Definite Plans Will Be Formulated Soon
Last Tuesday evening, at the weekly meeting of Student 
Council, the feasibility of having a campus clock tower was dis
cussed. Charles F. Slater '35, Department of Architeeturc, prcted a brief history- of the proposed project, aud a letter of 
recommendation from Edmund J. McCormick 34, former chair
man of the committee for the erection oi a clock tower.The idea of having a clock tower#--------: --------------------------:-----------was first conceived in 192B at one of the Y. M- C. A. conclaves by Professor Wurts. During the following years there were many comments made on bis suggestion.
Ira Kuhn 33- made a definite proposal, of having a clock tower as planned last spring. Later he brought it to the attention.of Student Council who approved the

-oject and incorporated it in the form of a recommendation to the 1933-34 Student Council:Appi
sisting of Rosemary Saxton 34 and Edmund/McQormick. The committee indicated that^the tower would symbolize the appreciation of the Btudents for what Andrew Carnegie presented to them.After consulting the Department of Architecture, It was found possible for a student, with faculty supervision, to design and draw working plans for a tower. As a result a nine-hour competition was held in that department. Se/eral designs were submitted as possibilities for a campus clock tower.The outstanding  designs were taken to Student Council and later to members of the Executive Board who. gave approval of the design executed by Charles Slater. Time was consumed in the study of details relative to the exact site, material, and other factors that
project.Clay Model Constructed In the spring of 1934 a preliminary clay mqdel of the proposed tower was constructed to create student enthusiasm.It was suggested by the student
students and built by the students. This would -afford many departments work for their students in .'theirv paitlculac.'.fleMs.Through' the reconimeridatibn of the past' chairman--. of' ..the clo.ck1 tower committee, " definite . plans

Amendment 
Is Proposed
Appointment of Treas. 
Suggested by Hays
It has been proposed by Clar Y. Hays 35, treasurer of Student Council, that all incoming treasurers be chosen by appointment rAther thau by election as Is done at the present time. The present method of selecting incoming treasurers is done by a majority, vote of the members of Student Council, upon the recommendation of the outgoing treasurer.Mr. Hays arrived at this conclusion because of the fact that he and Mr. Rollln V. Davis, Executive Secretary of Student Council, are the only ones who come Into actual contact .with the junior treasurers, and therefore are in a better position to judge who Is better fitted for the job than the members of; Council. Mr. Hays' proposition calls for -the appointment of all treasurers to be made by the treas- 'Q^5^'an.^*th^'*fi*.Bcut^v^r-SecrotiTy, of Student Council.Inasmuch as It is necessary that all amendments - to the constitution of Student Couhcir'inuat rest one week before being acted upon, dlscusslon of the proposal has been postponed until tonights- meeting of Council. It Is expected that a definite decision upon the suggestion.will be. reached by that time.

THE ABNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1934
THE 
TUESDAY 
QUARTERBACK 
 
BY JERRY HANSON
P
JUPITER PLUVIUS REFUSES TO RELENT it would seem,, for he 
certainly didnt do much to help the attendance to what started out like 
a mighty fine game. However, we can't blamt the rain gods foi 
manner In which the Boilermakers neatly folded the Plaid In Satur
days Homecoming blow-up. ' 
The Tartan grldmen looked good for the first halfthey do that 
habituallybut when Purdue put on the steam and burst out with the 
power that makes the Boilermakers strong contenders In the Big Ten 
Circle, the Scotch machine kinda sighed and settled down'in resigns^tlon.
['I Once the steam was up, the Plaid could do little to cover It, and 
rithinge started popping pretty fast.
^BLOCKING AND TACKLING WERE WEAK'points In the Tartan game 
J$egainst Purdue, and the boys could stand a lot of practice and coach
ing on these points. I saw a coupla nice white jerseys well-preserved 
lafter several minutes of playthats one way of telling whether or not 
s3a man's been into'the thick of the scrap.
Good old Joe was markedly the star again. His hoots are improv
ing from week to week, and hes doing darned well In the quarterback 
iositlon. He uses his head plenty, and his natural attributes go to 
a reliable man in anybodys game. Chyczewskl played 
[dandy game. Frank Is the Burzlo type guard, and be shows promise of 
"developing Into a brilliant player. He has two more years' to make 
^good lus and with the start he's Bhown already, his future looks pretty 
bright. And the same goes for Freddy Lehman. That boy is air full
backno baby about it. Freddy did a lot of. tackling in the second 
'hair against Purdue, and he was roost consistent In gaining yardage.
For the outstanding example of reliability I give you Cliff Doloway. 
[Under the handicap of a leg injured In the Notre Dame game, Cliff 
played the entire gome and gave the usual excellent account of ltli 
aolt Doloway always puts out everything lie haswhich is plenty 
and is really the only consistently good player on the Tartan squad. 
He'll, be very difficult to replace neat year.
The Plaid offensive showed practically nothing, as a glance at the. 
statistics of the game will show, with net yardage from scrimmage to
ll taled at forty-Blx. The boys might have done better to pass moro.
j WORTHY OF COMMENT Is the fact that the slate or Carnegie peni altles has been kept unusually clean this year. Last year the number 
| of offsides, etc., was appalling.
ALL INDICATIONS WOULD PLACE Carnegie in a pretty good posibounce the jinx at N. Y. U. next Saturday, aB far as the VioJ concerned. Carnegie has faced New . York University for sev
eral years with the odds In favor of the Plaid, but something has al
ways turned up to give the Violet power to cut down whatever edge 
them. ^ This will be about the last chance the Scots will 
have to bring home a pound or two of the breakfast order of salted pig, 
and ye optimistic scribe is going to try to make the trip over to digest 
portion of it on the spot.
ST. MARYS, TEXAS TECH, SOUTHERN METHODISTS/ and Callforare a few western teams, one of. which might find itself on the Tar
tan ehedtii aomt day. if we are to pay any heed to demon gossip. 
Suicide Is a strong word, but those teams are matches for the 
mightiest, and aftor- a long, trip out to meet them. Lord knows what 
they would do to an unwary Invader, especially when the caliber of the 
latter Is unestabllshed. Beware,' eez I. - "  n
SOMEONE WAS HEARD TO REMARK Uiat all the training the Plebes 
have been having has been ^fundamentalstackling, etc. This was in 
application to the statement in this column that the freshmen were 
weak on the self-same score. All I can say Is. that any accusation may 
accordingly be turned Into an admission.
The frosh are still being used mainly as bait for the varsity. They 
may bare games with West Virginia,' Pennsylvania State Prison, and 
Uuquesne; It Is all very Indefinite.___________________________________

Pitt comes across Forbes on the fourteenth for a return match with the Tartan squad. Last yar Giolma drew first blood when he crossed the Une ahead of Pitt's entries. Coach Halferty al6o mentioned the probability of Carnegie entering the 'district championship meet on the "24th of November.
The starters for the Plaid In the Saturday run are: Giolroa, Babin, Beal, McMahon, Means, Koch, and Neff.
The plebes are set to entertain five teams. Today at 4:00 oclock

For the second year ia succes
sion, the Tartans have taken It

wind and rain, the Plaid valiantly 
went down to defeat to the tune of 
20-01
The first half of the game wai 
great exhibition of good football 
the part of both teams, for they 
seemed to be very- evenly matched 
and capable of holding each other 
exactly where they wanted, In the 
last two chapters of the game, how
ever, the Tartans seemed to have 
become an entirely different team.
Lid OFT In Second Half
Although they showed real 
strength during the' first part or 
the battle, they were completely 
weakened after the second whlsLle, and did not seem to be able to hold the pepped-up Purdue outfit at all After the Boilermakers first tally, the Skibos lost their morale, and after the second Bcore they were almost in a state of pknlc.
Purdue undoubtedly outplayed Carnegie lads, for they
than the Tartans. The trick play of using two quick passes, -whl.ch the Harpster-coached outfit, was successful each time it tried, but It did not account for gains of any great length.
The passing- attacks of both iams were poor, for neither outfit got very far on passes, most of them either being knocked down missed by the player for whom they were Intended. In the third quarter, however, Purdue managed > compete a couple of passes at very vital time, and managed to get Into a position to score.

Perhaps one of the most striking players sfeen at the- Stadium in some time was little Orville Anderson.

Ail Opportunity for 
Human Service
The nucleus for the student personnel ad
visory, body which the Tartan has advocated 
In two preceding editorials Is already present 
on the Carnegie campus, What Is needed Is 
Its formal organization and authorization to 
function' as sch. We speak of the Depart
ment of, Psychology and .Education.
As the Initial move, the Tartan.suggests tbat 
a committee, headd/by. Dr. Schoen, be ap
pointed by the Educational Senate, and that 
thia-committee be authorized to organize and 
conduct a student personnel advisory service 
endiomake such further recommendations to 
th ^Senate as its experience in the work 
dictates. }
it Is not the Tartans aim to advocate the 
establishment, of a body or-committee to.su--. 
; persede or. encroach upon the.student relations 
whi<$ the departments Individually feel to be 
.rightfully their own. Rather, It Is*intended to 
supplement departmental work with respect to 
student problems which go below those sur
face difficulties which are normar solved by 
; curricular, adjustments. - .
6oine departments, recognizeand attempt to: 
meet:the* need, for student' aid. Their- efforts,- 
however, because of. natural limitations, are 
not and cannot be a substitute loria capable 
student advisory body; Where denials of this 
'-statement .are made, there you will And: an!. 
Ignorance of and a lack oft sympathetic in
sight Into the real nature of niany student, 
problems.
:. While we should hesitate] perhaps, to be
queath, a burden of such magnitude to a department already well occupied* the opportu*. 
nltles for practical and beneficial work seems 
to be justification enough in Itself, i Further, 
here are men in- that department whom the 
.-Tartan believes to be eminently well-fitted ;to 
undertake such a task, '.
Dr. Schoen,. head of the department, would, 
serve as the coordinator, the administrator,, 
".whose special duty it would be to analyze the 
nature of the student's difficulty and direct him; 
. to th proper person tor advice and,help.
To the emotionally*-maladjusted.student. Dr. 
Shaffer, could offer-hls specialized, training and. 
experience. In abnormal psychology.- And for. 
that aspect of personnel work whlch depends 
:Upo teetfl and. measurements, Professor Clee.ton could contribute the experience which has. 
- served to establish, him as an'authority In that 
isid. ; ;  - ;.
rlcular problems need an Impartial assisting 
-'agency: to which they can lum-. for trained, 
;sympati6tfe. advice leading toward-.proper. ad
justments. It may or may not be the college' 
or university's OBLIGATION .to. provide, s'uoh 
 source .oi-expert counsel, but It Is certainly 
an ' OPPORTUNITY for rendering enduring 
_human .service..
The Bell Tower
Renewal of discussion of the. Bell Tower 
. nc; again brings before the. student .body a 
mtter of prime Importance.' While this stu
dent-subject Is-familiar t all upperclassmen 
it nevertheless needs Introduction, to the fresh
men.' Forthis ttsauon a complete account; of 
the history- of the Bell Tower up Co the present' 
time Is given elsewhere in this Issue.
A true understanding of the worth- of this 
project can be obtained by viewing, it In every 
light. Both practically, and emotionally- Its 
value to the campus must be carefully 
weighed. It was origlnaliy conceived as  
monument to Andrew Carnegiej'^ That 'conceit 
lion m.ust be grasped by every student or-th 
 entire significance of the undertaking is lost.

Disgruntled Students And 
lad fferent Faculties
It Js neither a new nor an original thought 
tbat^ a close relationship between student and 
faculty-membere will bring-better results In ed-~ 
ucstlon then where that relationship does not 
exist, it is a' fact generally conceded by leading 
educators and something striven for by every 
Institution of higher learning .In the country. 
Some have taken pains to experiment with 
tutorial systems to. achieve the- deBtred end 
while others have more or less left It up to 
each Individual faculty member to break down 
any barriers that might exist between himself 
and his students and so pave the way to more 
friendly relations. Of the two methods, the 
latter Is practiced at Carnegie, The degree It 
has attained. Is somewhat' a matter of conjec
ture. One disgruntled student, whoso letter 
appears on page five, has written la no uncer
tain terms' that he considers it a dismal fallAlthough we consider- his letter -to be an 
exaggeration of the condition here, we feel 
that it is justified, to certain extent, because 
that Intimacy between faculty and. student 
does not exist to the degree tbat it might. It 
Is be expected that an instructor who sees his 
students two or.three times a week can be
come a good friend of all of them. A certain 
amount of co-operation is required oa the pact 
of the student. He must realize that the class
room Js not the only place to contact the fac
ulty. Yet there is, and always will be,, a large 
group of students who are reluctant or 111 at 
ease about speaking to their instructors concernfng' things other than their school work, 
it Is precisely with these students that the 
faculty has its biggest problem.  .
Too much emphasis cannot be laid upon tho 
need tor aolving this problem;. Its solution 19 
an essential, an almost indispensable factor In. 
any plan or education! ^t is not suEflcientthat 
an Instructor teach hiB j course and make his 
classes interesting. Unless he wins the con
fidence and friendship of his students, he will 
not have done his job well.

.the river. On these fall mornings ... first impression of the river Is one of grey* ness. Everything Is dead grey, the river, the opposite shore, the sky, the very air. The river looks sullen and- tired, like a cross old woman who Js forced to keep plodding along. It looks as though It wants to toss waves Into the air and slap them down again, but it can't, for there seems to be a film stretched taut from bank to bank that holds the water stlii. The air Is heavy with fog. In some places we cant oven see the opposite shore, it Is the penetrating grey mist that takes all the life out of the morning. There seems to be no end to it. It meets the grey sky so that we cannot tell which is sky, which* is fog. It lies In everlasting layers to all sides of us. It liquifies and becomes the river. Finally it drifts into our minds to maroon, our thoughts and to hynotlze us into useless, staring faces. We dumbly .watch the dark ehapes of bridges and buildings aa they float past. We dont think. We simply sit and stare out into the fog. Even' the conductor, with his sharp "All tickets, please, does .not rouse us from our lethargy. We are asphyxiated by rog. Then, as the train turns to cross the river, we can look strafgl-*. down from the'bridge into the water. Wv notice that-there is no fog between us and the river. There Is just cold grey space, and then the restlesB water. Now. too, we can see the thin white streamers of fog rising from the river like' uncertain ghosts. We waken' gradually from our stupor aa we leave the train and get away from the river. In town, the buildiDgs seem to disperse the fog'. The air 1b lighter, and once more our minds, shaking off the fog, are free.ELIZABETH WEST.
through the galleries, armed,Waterloo, with lorgnettes, guide books, and smug smiles of understanding assumed defensively-for the pasBers-by. Occasionally, a genuine art student enters, without pomp,or display; many.other would- be students meander about with wrinkled eyebrows and frankly bewildered expressions; while quite a few self-appointed Btudents strut ceremoniously from picture to picture, prattling glibly on what is art and what Isn't.'
Most of these sell-appointed critics think that art Is peculiar and neurotic unless ' obviously Intelligible to the humblest layman .with little or no training in appreciation. Art, they argue, shpulU be a com-  mon fount of. Inspiration for all ages and classes of people., is appreciation really so spontaneous, though? Don't people develop slowly into understanding, instead ot being born with it? In literature, A; B. C's and parts of speech precede Shakespeare; in music, scales and chords are mastered before Bach's Fugues; and In mathematics, simple addition and subtraction come? before the solution of poly
in mld-alr?
Another obsession of these tenth rate critics 1J the cult of perfectionism. That ain't art, Is hissed at whatever falls short of conventionally ideal form ot* color. Everything from cats to steel mills must be lovely, lofty, and full of sentiment before it le really art to them, and not just another daub of paint. They forget tKat painting, as well as literature, la versatile In Its scopcthat there are Chaucers, Shelleys, Rabelais! and ONeills of the brush as well as of the penand that each artist, like each author, speaks through the medium of a different personality.Many laymen'have the same attitude toward painting as toward the theater and the other arts.

This he did, and, says Time, Promptly the dam broke. Spanish radicals might be in the minority, but they were ready and tbey

Inquiring Reporters Get Student 
Opinion of Vocational Advisory Plan
Some Find Present System 
Efficient; Others Would 
Try New Bureau
an effort to check up on the general attitude of the student body ards/ the question of a person- advisory system, three Tatian reporters spent one day last week asking questions of unsuspecting undergraduates.
The question asked was "Would you approve .of the establishment vocational and personnel advisory bureau at Carnegie?

Therefore, there should )me advisory system whereby all freshmen would be talkei} to

"A bureau should be established in order that students can discuss their- problems with an Impartial person and. thereby discover the field For which they are best equipped.James Stewart.
"Yes, if used as a Brain Trust to determin the policies oE the, school and to. keep the students' schedules

 TRADITION OF REFINEMENT IN 
DRESS HAS BEEN MAINTAINED 
THROUGH GENERATIONS BY YALE 
UNDERGRADUATES AND ALUMNI.
It is therefore a significant tribute that well-dressed 
Yale men prefer trousers and slacks equipped withi 
Kover-Zip, the invisible seamline closure.
Further evidence of Kover-Zip's correctness fro in 
th standpoint of style is its approval by Yale's 
leading college tailors.
 .  famous yak and "Harvard tailor 
for over 40 ytars, saysOur custom 
tailoring establishments in New Haven, Cambridge and New 
York, always scrupulously cautious in tlie acceptance of design 
innovations, whatever their origin, are nevertheless responsive 
to every style development that is In good taste.
"Although we have been witness to  growing favor for the 
zipper fly, we could not accept the ordinary 6lide fastener as 
fit for fine clothes. The hew covered zipper, however, does 
meet our standards in every respect and we are now pre
pared to equip trousers and slacks with the Kcvcr-Zip fly.

COLLEGE MEN PREFER CLOTHES MADE WITH INVISIBLE CLOSURE
Stylq experts and fashion' authorities are 
well aware that ihe preferences of college . 
men foirn an important and dependable In
dication of the trend in men's apparel.
 One detail of mens clothing which until 
now has never been satisfactory is the fiy of - 
the trousera. The buttoned fly, no matter 
how carefully made, is bulky because of the 
extra' fold of material required; it bulges and 
wrinkles in a way that is most unsightly.. , 
ThesUde-fafltgnedflygivesa*much smooth- ' 
or and neater effect in front than' is posible 
with* buttons but the ordinary slide fastener i 
has an uncovered Btrip ol racial that Is ob
jectionable to men who take pride in being 
well-dressed.
The new inviaiblo style-line closure, the' 
Kover-Zip fly, has eveiy practical advantage . 
ot the ordinary zipper, and in addition is 
superior^ to it from the standpoint of good - 
tsstebecausenometalshowsthe units of the  
fastener are concealed by a grosgrain ribbon 
that harmonizes with the fabric of the trou- - 
sei^ and is guarnn teed to outlast the garment.
The Kover-Zip fly has beenacdaimedand 
adopted by best-dressed seniors in Amer
ica's foremost colleges, and a typical expresion of opinion about this invisible seam* 
line closure, the finest and most expensive 
slide fastener-made, is the following state
ment by Robert L. Henderson of Harvard, .
class of 1934:
The covered zipper 
for the trouser fly la :. 
the most practical and 
stylish, device yet hit v 
upon ... it does away ; 
with the objectionable v 
atrip of metal seen in V 
the ordinary .zipper.-*. ; ; 
College men every*: 
where, from Cambridgeto Palo Alto, welcomed 
the Kover-Zip fly and now demand it.alikeon dress trousers, informal suits and slacks. 
Smooth , and smart efficient and durable, 
Kover-Zip is the closure for all modem dothes :

' If the student has developed knack of critical self-analysis, he
have arrived at by study of the new data provided by the strato- sphere flights. The'most important thing he learns Is that night school Is' entirely different from any  catlonQl flights he may have taken heretofore.

Well, I guess.- I.have noticed eral of the newcomers standing- around wondering what the next turn is going to be. Yes, it Is fact that these new students have never attended a place of learning ince they finished their high school and that they are entering upon a new course of study.
That commenting upon the suggestion'made in last week's issue of the TartanPlaid to the night students  concerning the speak

That from the statistics published we still have Industries with us. The registration figures given recently indicate that there were 767 Industries students competing with 761 Engineering. I suppose it. is difficult to absorb In so short a timj such a large group as was once listed as Industries. I am wondering who will win the con* test in the lost analysis.

Carnegie Grill Is 
Ideai Restaurant
Cafeteria Offers Convenient 
Facilities to Students
While the Carnegie Grill has been located on the Campus since wuy back when, most of the students have given It a glance in passing and forgottcn-about it. Thewritei decided recently that perhaps this was not a it should be, or he wae himself: guilty of this indifference. So, a tour of Inspection was made, resulting In the conclusion that If there Is a more cleanly restaurai that offers better service or moi appetizing menus, it does not exist to the writers knoweldge. The poor patronage of the night dents is regrettable, for r of us Inconvenience ourselves by getting our meals on the wa class when we have them waiting ue right on the campus. Why give the Grill a tryout? The entence of its location and the undeniable fact that you couldnt obtain better food or service anywhere in the neighborhood are not the only points in its favor. The patrons are students of Carnegie almost to a man (or woman) and will make acquaintances . that will well repay you for doing your self a favor.
