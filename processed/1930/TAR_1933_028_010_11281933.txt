Thanksgiving Struggle Ends 
Careers of Many Plaid 
Gridiron Heroes
Oaklands long-standing gridiron 
end will be renewed this Thursday 
fterrioon when the charges of Dr. 
John B. Sutherland meet the once 
lowerful but now somewhat batftered proteges of . Howard HarpIster in the Stadium. Some 40,000 
or 50,000 football enthusiasts are 
expected to assemble in the huge 
oval to witness the festivities.
Not since 1928, when Harpster 
himself was leading Plaid forces, 
|has Carnegie beaten Pitt. Every 
ear the powerful Panthers have 
capitalized on every break and 
have taken the winners end.
Harpster has always been a 
thorn in the side of the Blue and 
Gold. Two out of the three years 
lie was in varsity competition, he 
was largely responsible for Pitt 
defeats.
The Panthers apparently have 
the advantage in every department 
:or this Thursdays important en:ounter. Pitt has defeated Navy, 
otre Dame, Duquesne, and Neraslca and has lost to Minnesota 
While the Skibos have been licked 
twice and tied twice. In weight 
Pitt has about a ten-pound advan
tage to the man, and the big Blue 
line is every bit as good as that 
forward wall which Don Lovewell 
has so miraculously assembled in 
one season.
Pitt will be well rested after a 
week and a half layoff, while Car-Inegie has not yet recovered from 
the hard battle against N. Y. U. 
last Saturday. The Plaid also will 
be inferior to their rivals in re
serve strength.
! One great advantage, on the 
pother hand, lies with the Scotclh 
They are the underdogs, and noth
ing helps a team more than to 
know it has everything to gain 
and nothing to lose.
The Thanksgiving party will be 
. the last appearance of a number 
! \f Carnegie gridiron notables. 
^Ipaptain Colin Red Stewart will 
)e playing his last collegiate game, 
is will be Burzio, I-Ieinzer, Dreshar,

Pitt Pep Rally 
Will Be Held 
At Noon Wed.
Harpster, Kiltie Band 
Will Be Features Of 
Sylvan Theater
The Pitt-Tecli game pep rally will 
take place tomorrow at one oclock 
in the Sylvan Theater. All stu
dents who have lunch or a free 
hour at twelve-thirty are expected. 
Students who have classes at the 
time will not be excused for cuts.
This arrangement will enable 
the maximum number of students 
to attend the celebration. There 
are only a limited number of stu
dents who have classes at twelvethirty. Again, under the old sys
tem of holding the rally on Friday 
evenings, commuting students 
found it inconvenient to be pres
ent.
It should be remembered that the 
rally does not affect the school' 
schedule. Regular classes ensue 
at one-thirty as usual.
Howard Harpster, mentor of the 
Tartans; Clarence Buddy Over
end, graduate manager of athletics, 
and Colin Red Stewart, captain 
of the team, will be guest speak
ers, according to Ammon Godshall, 
chairman. The Kiltie Band will be 
present to add color to the occa
sion. It is rumored that a num
ber of surprises have been plan
ned. 
This is the first time for a num
ber of years that a football pep 
rally lias been held during school 
hours. The committee wishes to 
emphasize the necessity of a large 
attendance to make the final rally 
of the season a success..
In the evening, a Pitt-Tecli pep 
rally dance in Thistle Hall will 
climax the pre-game celebration.

DEFENDS ENGINEERS 
IN ANNUAL REPORT
Will Have Even Heavier 
Responsibilities in Near 
Future, Says Head
A prediction that the study of 
engineering will ultimately become 
a graduate course and that en
gineers may have even heavier re
sponsibilities in the near future is 
made by President Thomas S. 
Baker in his annual report.
Defending engineering against 
the many critics of today, Presi
dent Baker stated:
"During the depression it has 
been customary to disparage en
gineering, to blame technology for 
many of the economic difficulties.- 
and to prophesy for the engineer 
a less important role than he has 
played in the past. The first inti
mations of industrial recovery 
seem to show that modern business 
is inextricably mixed up with 
technology and that the technolo
gists will, as far as we can see, 
continue to guide industrial prog
ress.
Have Heavier Responsibilities 
Indeed, heavier responsibilities 
may in the near future be his. 
Competition between nations in 
the world market for the sale of 
manufactured commodities will be 
keener and therefore the engineer 
who creates and directs processes 
in manufacture must not only have 
profound technical knowledge but 
also a broader understanding of 
world economics than that pos
sessed by engineers of the past 
generation. The world may make 
use of fewerengineers but it will 
place an even higher premium upon 
expert knowledge and skill.
The training of such men will 
require a longer period than that

Colloquium Hears 
Dr. Stern Speak 
At Noon Meeting
The first meeting of the Science 
Colloquium was held last Thurs
day, November 23, at 11:30 in the 
Carnegie Inn. The meeting took 
the form of a luncheon meeting, 
with Dr. Stern speaking on The 
Effraction of Molecular Rays, 
followed by a general disciission of 
:he topic presented during the 
luncheon period.
The Science Colloquium is a con
gregation of the members of the 
faculty and some of the under
graduate and graduate students 
who are interested in science. Its 
purpose is to facilitate the ex
change of ideas among those in
terested in research work and to
il acquaint members of the faculty 
(land others with specific scientific 
' investigations- which are under 
way at the present time on the
V campus.
j The Science Colloquium meets 
every two weeks, selecting its 
peakers from among the faculty 
nd research laboratories connectid with Tech. These talks inlude a report of the speakers own 
esearch, and reports of the gradiate students working under him.
The schedule of speakers for the 
remainder of the year includes Dr. 
Barret on December 7, and Dr. 
"Warner and Dr. Estermann on De
cember 21.
Y.W.C.A. to Hold

lub will be guests of honor at this 
neeting. There will be a dinner at 
five-thirty oclock, after which the 
Mens Glee Club will present a. 
Program of Christmas songs. Be
cause . of the festive spirit shown 
in these pre-holiday meetings, they 
are usually well-attended, and are 
outstanding in the series of Y

inet, was organized last Thursday. 
The officers are: Ruth Nichols,
resident; Doris Dietrich, vice

Welfare Drive Subscriptions 
Total Less Than Last Year
Campaign Is Extended Officially Until Tomorrow; 
Engineering, Industries Group Leads Colleges; 
Chairmen Should Make Returns Today
All classes will be discontinued 
for the Thanksgiving recess tomor
row at 5:30 p .m. This recess will 
include both night school and day 
school classes and will be effective 
until S:30 Monday morning, De
cember 4, when all classes will re
sume regular sessions.
Because the Pitt-Tech football 
game will be played on Thanksgiv
ing Day this year, it is expected 
that many more students will stay 
at school during this recess than 
have done so in former years. A 
number of social events have beeii 
planned for these students, includ
ing a Thanksgiving dinner, given 
by the Y. M. C. A., and dances in 
Thistle Hall on Wednesday and 
Thursday evenings.

Seeks Cooperation 
Of Rushees
The Welfare Drive on the Car
negie campus, which has continued 
for the past two weeks, has been 
extended until tomorrow. Accord
ing to original plans, the drive 
was to terminate on Friday, No
vember 24, but since last year's 
amount had not been* approached, 
and since many students had prom
ised to contribute this week, the 
time was officially lengthened until 
tomorrow.
The class and departmental 
chairmen in charge of the drive in 
the four colleges. are requested to 
make all returns to the Student 
Council office this afternoon, if pos
sible, and not later than tomorrow 
at 4:30. Definite figures of the 
amount of money obtained in the 
drive will then be available before. 
Thanksgiving vacation. Students 
planning to contribute toward the 
Carnegie Welfare Drive are urged 
to do so by today.
The Colleges of Engineering and 
Industries are at present leading 
in the contribution, with over $100 
to their credit. One group of con
tributors succeeded in an effort to 
repeat last years quota of $1 per 
person. Margaret Morrison College 
is -second, having contributed 
about $50, and the College of Fine 
Arts has given $35. The final re
sults will be published in next 
weeks Tartan.
On Friday, November 24, the 
Welfare Drive of Allegheny Coun
ty reported an increase of $274,000 
in contributions received dui ng 
the past week. Although this de
notes splendid progress, it was evi
dent that the goal of $2,S37,000 
could not possibly be reached by 
today, the closing date of the drive. 
Contributions on Friday totalled 
51,625,000, leaving $1,212,000. It 
will therefore be necessary, ac
cording to the promoters of the 
county drive, to solicit additional 
contributions from those who .have 
already given their aid. These ad
ditional contributions will be re
quested especially from corpora
tions and donors of special gift 
subscriptions.

were the teachers in city schools. 
Toward their quota of $3S.000, 
these teachers had already do
nated $26,087 last Friday. Doubt
less they will have exceeded their 
quota by a large amount before to
day. This splendid , response is 
one of the most encouraging as
pects of the entire campaign.
Up to last Friday, the sum of 
$659 had been contributed by the 
Carnegie Institute and Library. 
Definite returns have not been re
ceived from the Pittsburgh col
leges who are conducting their 
own drives, but an enthusiastic co
operation is reported by all of 
them. The seekers of subscriptions 
in the county drive are working 
untiringly, and the plans of the 
entire organization are progressing 
smoothly.
The numerous agencies which 
will benefit by the Welfare D.ive 
are hospitals, settlement houses, 
private relief organizations, homes 
for children and aged people, and
Y organizations. Unemployment 
cases are not included in this plan, 
since they are financed by federal 
and state organizations. The main 
reason for the concentrated effort 
put forth this year is the notice
able decrease in the funds of wel
fare agencies in contrast to their 
extended activities.
Carnegie Dollar 
Day Drive Opens
Today is Carnegie Dollar Day, 
the opening day of the seventh an
nual Dollar Day campaign among 
Carnegie alumni. Today each 
alumnus is asked to contribute 
one dollar or more to the Carnegie 
Endowment Fund.
Contributions during the cam
paign will be turned over to the 
Carnegie Tech Endowment Com
mittee, and will come under the 
two-for-one agreement with the 
Carnegie Corporation by which 
the school will receive eight mil
lion dollars in 1946 provided it has 
raised four million.
During the six years that the 
campaign has been held $2,500 has 
been raised by the Alumni Federa
tion, but more than half of this 
was raised the first two years. 
During the last two years the 
amount has fallen off considerably, 
and therefore the Alumni Federa
tion hopes that this year a come
back can be made, and that the re
sults. will break all previous rec
ords.
Between now and 1946 the money 
collected will be.invested and will 
draw interest, so that one dollar 
contributed now will amount to 
five dollars in 1946 when the Car
negie Corporation has doubled the 
four millions collected. Alumni 
and friends of Carnegie are urged 
to take advantage of this ability to 
increase their money so greatly 
and contribute a small amount to 
the Endowment Fund now.
Open rushing for Carnegie fra
ternities will begin at S:30 a. m. 
next Monday morning. Interfra
ternity Council emphasizes the im
portance of co-operation between 
rushees and fraternities in comply
ing with the rules which it has 
adopted.
Each year trouble arises because 
of negligence or misunderstanding 
where definite dates with rushees 
are concerned. A rusliee who 
finds that he has confused Ills 
dates can help to avert misunder
standings between fraternities if 
lie will immediately get in touch 
with the houses whose dates con
flict. The Council requests that 
fraternities have a clear under
standing with rushees concerning 
all dates. It also urges the avoid
ance of high-pressure rushing.
Until S:30 on Wednesday, De
cember 6, fraternities shall confine 
themselves to rushing only. Any 
bids offered before this time will 
be void. Rushing may not begin 
before 8:30 any morning, and must 
be over by 10:00 on a night pre
ceding a school dny.
On Sunday, December 10, the 
rushee will go to the fraternity 
house of Ills choice, become 
pledged, and receive his recogni
tion pin. This pledgesliip shall be 
honored by all fraternities.
Any infraction of the. rules 
adopted by Interfftiternity Council 
will be penalized by a fine of $50, 
to be paid by the offending fratornity, and by the loss of all in Ira 
mural competitive privileges. Fra 
ternlties having charges against 
other fraternities for breaking 
rushing rules must milte the 
charge in writing and present it to 
Interfraternity Council before Jan
uary 6.
Men who leave the dormitories 
after rushing season are urgently 
requested to co-operate with Miss 
M. E. Helm, head of the dormito
ries, in turning In their keys and 
complying with the rules for check
ing out as listed in the White 
Book.

dance which will be held Wednes
day evening from 9 to 12 in This

dance. Members of the Pitt and

of the dance, has. announced that, 
as a special attraction, a live tur
key will be given away for a door

$1 per couple as usual.
Bert Wydener has played at sev
eral dances on the campus this 
year. Among these were the W.
& J. football dance and the Cwen 
tea dance. Last year the orches
tra played at four of the major 
Pitt dances and, in addition, for 
college dances at W. & J., Penn 
State, Wayn6sburg and Grove City. 
Last summer it was sent, to Lon

Philco Radio Company.
The following chaperons have 
been invited: Lt. and Mrs. Burton, 
Lt. and Mrs. Tower, Mr. and Mrs. 
Norman H. Dawes, and Mr. and 
Mrs. Lawrence Ii. Miller.
Carnegie officials received the 
following report from the George
town University Athletic Associa
tion. It is made up of unbiased 
opinions from the four officials in 
regard to criticisms of unnecessary 
roughness and ungentlemanlike 
conduct of the; football players 
during the Georgetown - Carnegie 
Tech game on November ,1S.
The opinion of each official fol
lows :
. Referee P. P. Magoffin states: 
I note considerable publicity in 
the papers concerning alleged un
necessary roughness In the Georgetown-Caruegie Tech football game, 
played last Saturday ... As 
referee of the game I Avlsh to state 
that it cannot possibly be classed 
as an unnecessarily rough game. I 
cannot recall a single complaint 
during the game, by any Carnegie 
man, of roughness on the part of 
Georgetown players ... As a mat
ter of fact there appeared to be an 
excellent feeling between the bpposing players during most of the 
game, and there were numorous in
stances of opposing players help
ing their opponents to their feet 
after plays ... I folt well satis
fied with the conduct and sports
manship of the players of both 
teams on the field of play, and I 
feel certain that the spectators as 
a. whole felt as I did, and that they 
came away knowing that they had 
seen a game wherein the llnoplay 
was fierce and magnificent for a 
goodly portion of the game ... I 
was sorry of the incident after the 
game, and I feel that all teams befpro going on the field of play, 
should bo Instructed to allow the 
officials to take possession of the 
ball after the game and to bestow 
it upon the winning team, or In 
qaso of .a tie, to the visitlon team." 
-'Umpire Paul Menton states: I
was not only greatly surprised 
when you stated Carnegie Tech 
had accused Georgetown of rough 
tactics in the game and after the 
game.' It is hard for mo to be
lieve there Is not somo mistake. 
It was one of the most quiet, games 
I liavo worked In tills fall ... I 
really thought It a vory dull game 
imd In the dressing room following 
the contest, Mr. Gass, who sorved 
as linesman, stated ho had spoken 
to Mr. Harpster, coach of Carnoglo, 
who told him he simply couldn't 
got his boys keyod up for the 
game. That Is the reason It Is 
hard for me to bollo.vo Carnoglo 
thought It was a rough game . . . 
Regarding the fight after the game, 
I know nothing about It. I thlnlc 
It was a most silly thing for a 
player to grab the ball or attempt 
to got lt, unless he wished to pre
sent it to the Carnegie captain. I 
thlnlc I mentioned this in my re
port to Mr. Olceson, but I thought 
nothing further of the matter. I 
didnt see the skirmish but under
stood it involved spectators and 
not players.
Head Linesman S. J. Gass had 
this to say to the Washington Her
ald: The very absence of any
consistent penalizing Saturday 
ought to prove that everything 
was above board on the field .
I talked to Howard Harpster after 
the game and he wasnt perturbed 
at all. He simply said that George
towns line had played admirably 
and that the Carnegie first team 
couldnt be talked into taking the 
I-Ioyas seriously enough.
Field Judge J. G. Crowley states: 
In regard to game on November 
18 between Georgetown and Car
negie Tech, in which I was Field 
Judge, I can truthfully say that I 
didn't see any rough play or hear 
:iny abusive language. You realize 
the Field Judge is ordinarily quite 
some distance from the line of 
scrimmage and I didnt hear any
thing from the players that would 
indicate bad feeling, and, as a mat
ter of fact, on several occasions 
friendly conversations were held 
with opponents.

eggs were thrown at the motor

Carnegie Tech team from the hotel 
to Griffith Stadium and from the 
Stadium back to the hotel, a letter 
from the Traffic Manager of the 
Bus Company is as follows: "No
vember 22, 1933. On the afternoon 
of November 18th we transported 
in two of our motor coaches the 
Carnegie Tech football team from 
their hotel to Griffith Stadium and 
returned them to their hotel. Our 
drivers reported that there were 
no eggs thrown as alleged in the 
newspapers at our busses." Signed, 
C. H. Ellis, Traffic Manager. Blue
& Grey Sightseeing Tours, Inc.
Head Football Coach John L.. 
Hagerty, of Georgetown, makes 
this statement: "Concerning last
week's game between Georgetown 
and Carnegie Tech, I saw nothing 
out of the way in regards to un
necessary roughness, and, if there 
had been such tactics used, the 
officials would have surely taken 
the necessary measures to prevent 
it . . . After seeing that my boys 
were all right, I then went to the 
Carnegie Tech dressing room to 
pay my respects to Coach Harpster, but, upon being informed that 
he was not around, I then inquired 
for Captain Stewart, to whom I 
apologized regarding the football 
incident. In reply, Stewart said, 
Aw, forget about it. It was just 
one of those things.
The apology that Graduate Man
ager Gabriel Murphy offered to 
Clarence Overend, Graduate Mana
ger of Athletics at Tech, was as 
follows: "I apologize for the foot
ball player not giving the ball to 
your team. Murphy then visited 
the Tech dressing room and talked 
to Coach Harpster and his assist
ant, and apologized for the George
town player not presenting the 
ball to his (Harpsters) team. At 
that time he inquired from Harp
ster the condition of his players 
and asked if any medical treat
ment or hospitalization was neces
sary. He replied, "No treatment 
is necessary.
The attitude of the student body 
ai Georgetown, with regard to Car
negie Tech, can be best told by 
an editorial written by Thomas X. 
Scully, editor of the I-Ioya, the stu
dent paper, and Philip A. Hart, 
president of the Yard. "George
town has always considered Car
negie as a friend to be most highly 
regarded. We had thought Car
negie to entertain the same opin
ion of us. We would not under 
any circumstances risk that opin
ion.
THURSDAY WILL TELL THE TALE. Whether Carnogle Tech lo 
a Morning Glory team or In just In a slump will be docldcd then. In 
fact, it will mark the difference botwoen a successful and a poor sea
son. A victory over Pitt makes tho schedule of any toam a success, 
but this year It Is more than that. A victory over N. Y. U. would 
have made this year's record look good regardless of the 'outcome of 
tho Pitt game, but now it makes it practically imperative to stop the 
Panthers. If Pitt wins, Carnegie's season will look every bit as bad as 
last year's.******
IT CANNOT BE DENIED that tho Tartan havent shown a thing since 
tho Purdue game. Possibly tho offects of the "suicide schedule has 
taken tho toll, but that hardly explains.tho sad exhibition of bull 
carrying shown to tho cash customers of Now York City. Against Pitt 
a toam can fumble just once, and that is once too often. Dr. Suther
lands men aro noted for tholr ability to take advantage of every break 
given thorn, and if they got as many breaks as Carnegie gave the 
Violets last Saturday, tho old ball game is liable to turn into another 
track meet like tho fiasco of 1929.******
WHILE THE PLAID WARRIORS HAVE BEEN KNOWN to look very 
bad in past years against certain opponents, thoy always seem to be 
very much on tholr game against their ancient enemy. Last year the 
Skibos looked terrible in almost every game, but in that Pitt battle 
they looked like a national champion trying to hold its honors. Few 
will forget that game, when George Kavel and Hooks Sample made 
a few All-Americans look very, very bewildered.******
ONID PROMINIQNT CARNEGIE TECH TACKLE said that in tho Pur
due game the Tartan system of attack was up tho middle, around the 
end, and punt. After tho N. Y. U. gamo ho has probably changed this 
analysis to a fumble, a penalty, and an intercepted pass.******
THIS GEORGETOWN INCIDENT SEEMS TO KEEP popping up. In 
this issue we aro printing excerpts of a press release put out by the 
Georgetown A. A. defending their position. Personally I think too 
much attention was given to tho affair. Such things arc just part of 
tho game. The publicity given to the affair was most unfortunate.******
IN EITHER THE DECEMBER Rth or 12th issue of the Tartan there 
will bo published a composite All-American football team as chosen 
by thirty-two of tiio countrys loading college newspapers. This papers 
choices have already been sent into the Chicago Dally Maroon, who is 
sponsoring this project.
PLAID SHOWS LITTLE 
FORM IN DULL GAMEThe Carnegie crosscountry team 
finished its running season with a 
brilliant exhibition at Mprgantown, 
where the Tartans easily beat the 
West Virginia team 16 to 39 last 
Saturday. The Skibo harriers 
were in excellent snape for the 
run, and they took advantage of 
the fine weather and the footing 
which was offered by the Moun
taineers by placing the first four 
men and the sixth. Although the 
course was very difficult due to its 
unusual steepness, the West Vir
ginia crew could do little to keep 
the Tech men from placing in the 
favored positions. Allen and 
Giolma tied in crossing the tape 
first, time 2-1:55. Allen had taken 
a long lead way at the start of the 
lap, and Giolma caught him to
wards the finish of the race. They 
crossed the tape way ahead of any 
of the contesting runners.
The order of the finish was 
Allen and Giolma, tie for first 
Schell third, and Ramsey fourth, 
all four from Tech.. Hill, of West 
Virginia, took fifth for the Moun
taineers, and Netzer took sixth for 
Tech. I-Ioskins, Woodhull, Mason, 
and Jarvis, alt of West Virginia, 
took the remaining places in re
spective order.
The substantial victory which 
the Tartans liillcrossers took over 
the Mountaineers was a fitting 
finish to the Tech crosscountry 
season. The Tartans have had 
some bad luck in that two meets 
were called off. They ran only 
three of the five scheduled meets, 
those with Geneva and West
minster having been cancelled. 
Cancellation of meets is very dis
couraging to contestants in any of 
the fields of sport, and especially 
to the crosscountry runner, whose 
training takes the form of grueling 
practice over the course and track. 
The successful crosscountry run
ner is so because he lias dedicated 
many hours to solitary grinding 
away on the run to develop his 
lungs and legs. That the Tech 
harriers could conquer the Moun
taineers on the difficult and un
familiar course at West Virginia is 
proof of the spirit which they have 
kept flaming throughout the sea
son.
The crosscountry season was of
ficially closed by the election of 
Giolma for next years captaincy. 
Giolmas brilliant running career 
has easily won him the position.
Tartans Outplay Violet But 
Poor 13 a 11 Handling Is 
Inalai Handicap
Pitt Coach Has 
Brilliant Record
Again the N. Y. U. Jinx revealed 
Its potency as tho Violets downed 
tho Tartan squad 7-0 in the sloppi
est game of the year. The Plaid, 
odds-on favorites to take the New 
York lads, showed little or nothing 
In a game that featured fumbles, 
penalties and intercepted passes. 
Neither of the teams showed any
thing in the way of either a pass
ing or running attack and except 
for one pass which caught Carne
gie fiat-footed there was little im
pressive action. The score should 
have been a scoreless tie or, by 
the records and statistics, a vic
tory for the Pittsburgh boys but 
again they failed to capitalize on 
their breaks or show the necessary 
punch when in a scoring position.
Carnegie got ten first downs to 
N. Y. Us four and rushed the ball 
155 yards to the Violets' 48. The 
Plaid fumbled seven times with 
only three of them recovered safe
ly. The passing was sloppy and 
frequent Interceptions were fea
tured. Burzlo, needing to show his 
best form In front or the New York 
writers, was tied up by two men 
but still managed to make half the 
tackles, one time preventing a 
touchdown by nabbing an N. Y. U. 
back, who was in the clear, from 
behind. The whole line worked 
well, stopping most Violet line 
plays cold and throwing them for 
frequent losses, but this was not 
enough to win the ball game.
At the start it looked like a 
walkaway for the Tartans with 
them gaining 25 yards on the first 
three plays. After that however 
they were stopped cold, and a pass 
interception gave N. Y. IJ. the ball 
In Carnegie territory. In the same 
period the Tartans got a break, re
covering a fumbled kick on the 
homo teams 23. Again they 
muffed tholr chances when Carlson 
dropped a lateral and Sigel foil on 
it. A few successful passes and 
penalties put the Violets on Techs 
41 and then a pass from Smith t.o 
Slgol resulted-In,, the only touch
down of the game,
Torobus then took things in 
hand and started to play a hangup 
gamo, getting loose for sizeable 
gains but was unable to do any
thing as to getting clear. One time 
ho returned a punt, to the N. Y. U. 
34 and made other pretty runs. 
When ho was hurt and had to leave 
tho gamo, the fans Btood up and 
cheered him all tho way to tho 
bench. Bowser also got away for 
nlco gains but had trouble with 
fumbles. Throo times In tho last 
half tho Tartans woro within tho 
25-yard lino hut twlco lost their 
opportunity on downs and onco on 
an intoVcoptod pass.

Dr. John B. Sutherland is one of 
the most successful coaches in, the 
United States today. On taking 
over the coaching reigns of Pitt at 
the resignation of Glenn "Pop 
Warner, he has elevated his school 
to even greater heights. Almost 
every year he has placed a con
tender for national honors on the 
field.
Three times a Sutherland 
coached team has journeyed to the 
Tournament of Roses, but the 
famous Sutherland luck seems to 
fall on foreign soil. In 1927 Pitt, 
with the famous- Gibby Welch lead
ing the vangiiard, lost a hard 
fought battle to Stanford, 7-6. In 
1929 the U. S. C. Trojans routed 
the Oakland school, 47-14, and last 
year the Panthers lost to the same 
team by a 35-0 count.
Dr. Sutherland was a player 
himself, having been coached by 
Pop Warner himself at Pitt. He 
is a dentist by profession, but a 
football coach by choice. He has 
produced a number of great play
ers including Welch, Uansa, Mont
gomery, Doncliess, Daugherty, 
Parkinson, and Quatse.

of an

Student
According to a statement of Doc
tor Baker in his current annual re
port, the engineering education of 
the future will be considerably 
broader than at present In his 
opinion, the engineers of the fu
ture will reqlure not only 
a high degree of technical 
slcll but also a very com
prehensive understanding of 
world economics. This training 
will require a longer period of 
schooling and probably reduce tho 
number of graduates turned out 
yearly by our technical schools.
The opinion of prominent educa
tors is that universities will re
quire tho student to successfully 
pass a threo or four yoar courso In 
general subjects that will provide 
a. broad foundation for tho special
ized type of ongineering to bo 
studied later. Upon tho comple
tion of this course tho student will 
bo permitted to follow tho specific 
ongineering courso that ho feel3 
best iitted for.
These added studies will better 
(It engineers for positions of 
greater responsibility, and while 
the number of graduates will bo 
reduced, those who manage to get 
through will be greatly benefitod 
by theso changes in training pro
cedure.

quence, and of more significance, 
their appreciation. We have heard 
them express their satisfaction 
and their enthusiasm. We have 
heard them condemn. Many have 
failed to appreciate.
For the benefit of all these un
perceiving ones it would be wise 
to quote Mr. Homer Salnt-Gaudens, 
the director of Fine Arts of Car
negie Institute. He has written in 
his article, Presenting the Inter
national in the October issue of 
the Carnegie Magazine:
The Exhibition makes a plea 
for understanding, patience, and 
the realization that each of 
many forms of pictorial endeav
or has a reason for existenc 
and a proper audience, though no 
form should be forced upon those 
who do not care for its particular 
aspect.
If only the same liberality of 
thought, the same tasteful broad
mindedness, could be developed 
and put into use by our popular 
audiences.
It is discouraging to enter the 
French galleries looking for re
freshmentfor excellence, to walk 
up to the prize painting, St. 
Tropez by de Segonzac, and to 
find a large group of people clus
tered around it, standing at a dis
tance of perhaps two feet away 
from it. They shake their heads, 
moan and grumble. They say: 
If this is artwell then I know 
nothing about it. They usually 
say this loudly enough for the rest 
of the group to hear. There is 
just a tinge of smartnessof a 
childish desire to show offin 
the inflextion of their voices. They 
smile to themselves and walk 
away.
And now, only a few are left. 
Anger has taken the place of dis
couragement; anger- is apt to 
quicken mental activity. They be
gin to seek the pictures good 
points. They step back and away; 
they breathe a little more deeply. 
They take time to enjoy, to appre
ciate, to see and criticise color, 
tone, linear composition. They 
find themselves pleased with the 
delightful subject, although they 
know through their appreciation 
for technical excellence that this 
is of secondary importance. They 
find it a refreshing picture, a de
lightful piece of art work, and, In 
addition, a work of superior crafts
manship in organization. How 
often is such a combination found? 
Only in deserving prize pictures.
(To be Continued)
Thanksgiving recess begins olllcially on Wednesday evening at 
10:30 p. m., providing a welcome 
respite from labor to tho already 
weary night students. Classes 
will bo held as usual on Wednes
day evening, and will resume on 
Monday ovoniug, Docembor 4. Tho 
holiday, while short, will provldo 
the student body with a breathing 
spell that is well appreciated by 
anyone who over attended night 
classes.
The prospect of pumpkin pie, 
turkey, cranberry sauce and all tho 
fixlns has been in tho minds eye 
of tho student body for a sutllciently long time to make tho holiday 
more desirable than ever. The 
festivities are well placed, too. for, 
even with tho conditions that have 
obtained during tho past year, 
things could liavo been much 
worse.
Thanksgiving is unique among 
national holidays because of the 
sentiment embodied in it. It is 
extremely fitting that we should 
set aside at least one day a year 
to give thanks for tho many bless
ings and joys that life affords, 
even during a depression. Lifo 
should not be all hustle and bustle.
Appointment of Social 
Chairman Is Made, 
Assistant NamedDances may come and dances 
may Bo, but none of them can com
pare to a Thanksgiving Dance that 
is sponsored by the Night Student 
Council. Of all the night student 
tradition, the Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance is perhaps the most popular. 
Student participation and attend
ance always reaches its peak at his 
event, and from all indications 
this one will be no different than 
its predecessors.
The huge Mens Gymnasium 
will be the scene of this years first 
event to be sponsored by the 
Night Student Council. The im
mense barn-like structure will be 
transformed into a veritable palace 
of pleasure. The social chairman 
and his assistants have been very 
reluctant to divulge any informa
tion concerning the affair. If the 
budget  figures mean anything
something unusual will no doubt 
be offered the students for their 
approval.
The Council, through the social 
chairman, lias announced that 
Will Ryslianek and his orchestra 
will furnish the music for the occa
sion. This musical aggregation is 
well known 011 the night school 
campus and is 110 doubt the most 
popular orchestra that has ever 
played for any night school func
tion.
The Night Student Council lias 
invited as their guests and chap
erons for the evening: Mr. and
Mrs. H. K. Kirkpatrick, Mr. and 
Mrs. R. B. Leighou, Mr. and Mrs. 
W. Pfouts, Mr. and Mrs. W. N. 
Jones, Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Daniels, 
Mr. and Mrs. K. A. Thomas, Mr. 
and Mrs. R. D. ILepper, Mr. and 
Mrs. E. Warner, and Mr. and Mrs. 
J. B. Ellis.
Believe it or not when I tell you 
that Ripley is not the only one who 
has a monopoly on the big show 
business. Carnegie now has a 
show of Believe it or Not all its 
own. Why it is simply hard to be
lieve that such an austere, cold, 
rigid, book-learning institution 
could be so prosaic as to go into 
the horticultural business all of a 
sudden.
At the first meeting .of the Night 
Student Council. Edward White 
was elected vice president, Frank 
Kolsurn, secretary, and Robert 
Lalir, treasurer. These men will 
serve as oifficers of the Council for 
the present year.
Mr. White is registered in the 
Night College of Fine Arts in the 
Painting and Decorating Depart
ment, and was on the Student 
Council last year. Mr. White is al
so vice president of the College of 
Fine Arts. Mr. Kolsum, the newly 
elected secretary, is vice president 
of the Night College of Industries, 
where he is registered in the 
Works Management Course. He 
was a member of the Night Stu
dent Council last year. Robert 
Lahr, who was elected treasurer 
for the Council, was also a member 
of the same body last year. He is 
president of the Night College of 
Engineering and a very active 
student in the affairs of that school.
You see it is just like this 
There were three men in a boat" 
youre wrong. Anyway, some 
time during the nocturnal, vaca
tions at certain spots on the drives 
a little earth has been sprinkled, 
by whom you are at liberty to 
guess, and through the aid of one 
of the numerous fertilizing agents 
low and behold a crop of as fine 
iron mushrooms as you will find 
anywhere has sprung up. The 
spot adjacent to Maggie Murphy 
must have been exceedingly pro
lific because an unusually healthy 
variety has been produced. Just 
as you make the. ninety degree 
bend you are forced to dodge the 
new sprouts and what a jolt one 
gets. I tell you they are beauties 
and Fritz must be proud of his new 
venture in the fungi world. They 
certainly are ornamental specimens 
of traffic guides and on slippery 
nights should prove of benefit in 
PREVENTING accidents.
At this same meeting, C. A. 
Blochinger was appointed social 
chairman, and H. B. Stone, assist
ant chairman. Theso two students 
will be in complete charge of all 
social functions sponsored by the 
Council.
The Plaid congratulates all these 
men 011 the honor they have re
ceived and pledges them its 
hearty support.

Ah! after waiting several weeks

day. No Saturday or Monday

They can now put their legs un

"hardly believe that there will be

Students are Warned 
To Protect Machines
Night students are warned that 
son.a people believe that, until 
caught, there is profit in stealing 
automobiles from locations that 
provide a large selection of cars. 
On Monday evening, November 20, 
some of the predatory gentry were 
very active. They succeeded in 
one reported case in abstracting a 
Ford coupe from the Island in 
Schenley park, which takes the 
overflow from tho available park
ing spaces on the campus. The 
car was the property of a student 
in the Night College of Industries. 
A door handle broken from the car 
parked next to the stolen one was 
definite proof that an attempt had 
been made to steal it aJso.
It is advisable when parking 
your car off the campus to be 
cautious. The area surroundmg 
the- campus is rather dark, and 
provides an exceptionally fertile 
ground for the ' operations of 
weak characters. Locking your 
car will at least give you the as
surance that you did all that you 
could, and, perhaps will aid in dissuading further depredations.
Not only from our own South
land but from Turkey-from 
Greece  from all over the world  
the very cream of tobacco crops is 
gathered for Lucky Strike. And 
only the center leaves are used  no

is fully packedfirmlyrolled. Even 
the ends of the cigarettes are filled 
brimful of choicest tobaccos. No

4'THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1933
1I##GMT ON YOUR NERVES... NSVSRT1RE YOURTASTE
THE ROUNDERWATCH YOUR STEPCURRENT OPINIONON SECOND THOUGHT
By Will LandsbergLIBERAL TRENDS
If a politically-minded Rutgers 
student had pulled a Rip Van 
Winkle act in the Watchung Moun
tains on the eve of Roosevelts 
election, and woke up today, he 
would find greater changes in 
American political philosophy over 
his one years siesta than had oc
curred in Rips twenty.
We dont have to turn to the 
NRA or to the progressive trend 
in municipal elections for proof. 
Consider, merely, the changes our 
Rutgers Rip would find here when 
he returned to the campus.
Probably not even ten under
graduates could be found on the 
campus today who favor Hoover 
over Roosevelt, rugged American 
individualism over the liberal-radicalism of the "new deal. Yet, in 
the straw vote conducted by The 
Targum just before last years elec
tion, the student body voted for 
Hoover's reelection, 409 to 133.
Attendance at the four Liberal 
Club lectures this year has aver
aged well over a hundred students. 
When a Communist spoke last 
week, Geological Hall could not 
hold all the people who wished to 
hear the talk. Last year, on the 
other hand, the president of the 
club used to go a-begging at the 
library on the night of a meeting, 
lest the speaker speak to stone 
walls.
Even a cursory study of the drift 
of American thought, in college 
and out, during the past year 
makes this evident; he field of 
social battle has shifted. Govern
ment supervision of businessthis 
has come to stay. The conserva
tives have been forced to retreat 
from their once strong trenches of 
Individualism. But they are re
forming their lines in a new re
doubt, a partnership of govern
ment and business such that the 
benefits will flow in one direction, 
that of big business. The honest 
man, if he be also enlightened, is 
now in the camp of radical Repub
licans and Democrats, Socialists, or 
Communists. These groups, un
happily split, are now engaged in 
a titanic struggle to drive conser
vatism from its secondary line of 
defense.
On which side the American gov
ernment will- stand, one cannot 
yet say. When one surveys the at
titude of college men, those of 
Rutgers for example, one cannot be 
optimistic. For despite the gains 
indicated, the general attitude of 
the student body remains altogeth
er too reactionary, unthinking, un
enlightened. Good will is useless 
if blinded by stupiditywitness 
again the well meaning vote of the 
student body last year for Hoovers 
reelection.
II! support for real liberalism or 
radicalism does not come from the 
educated groups, what hope is 
there for the country? In Cuba, in 
most European countries, the stu
dents do not confine themselves to 
football games, or an occasional 
liberal lecture. They do things. 
The Targum, Rutgers U.
CARNEGIE DAY, 1933  THE 
one hour holiday  is already 
a thing of tho past and 
the fraternity men can now 
got back to the more serious 
business of making arrangements 
to pay the rent, while the Fresh
men (bless their hearts!) continue 
to wonder what 1L Js all about. In

President Roosevelts inaugural ad

Once again the nation prepares 
to celebrate Thanksgiving. This 
time I wonder if this holiday, com
ing when it does, truly reflects the 
attitude of the people. Do we feel 
that now, after the events and con
ditions of the last few years, we 
can, in all sincerity, give thanks. I 
say this because, at present, there 
is a rising tide of hostility toward 
the NRA. There are those who 
are expressing dissatisfaction, rais
ing doubts, and making covert at
tacks that are more harmful than 
frank, blunt criticism.
With the advent of NRA last June, 
business took a decided upward 
swing and conditions in general 
showed definite improvement. This 
turn for the better reached its 
peak in August and since then 
has declined. Is it fair to blame 
NRA for this drop? Seasonal lags 
have hitherto constituted a regular 
phase of industrial production and 
President Roosevelt or General 
Johnson are not to blame because 
the present one arrived on sched
ule. That is the normal path of 
recovery. The Eighteenth Amend
ment had a test which lasted thir
teen years. NRA has been in op
eration only five months and it 
may take five years before it ac
complishes its purpose. We must 
reconcile ourselves to that fact.
During the nine months he has 
been in office, President Roosevelt 
has worked marvels in restoring 
confidence in the minds of the 
countrymen. Taking command at 
a time when the moral of the 
country was at its lowest ebb, his 
inspired leadership relieved the 
fear, distrust, poverty and unem
ployment that was everywhere. 
His plan was-a daring one, affect
ing a change in government which 
some go so far as to consider a 
revolution. But it was conceived 
with foresight and imagination, and 
has, up till now, been carried out 
with strength and capability. The 
vast majority are behind the Presi
dent in his gigantic task. This has 
been shown during the last few 
months, by the amazing exhibition 
of faith and courage on the part of 
the people. If the New Deal fails, 
it will go down as a magnificent 
failure. If it succeeds, it will be a 
remarkable manifestation of the in
herent fortitude and integrity of 
the American people, and of the ca
pacity of a democratic government 
to solve the problems of the new 
industrial age without resorting to 
tactics of force and violence to af
fect the necessary changes.

most famous referee, has to keep his 
nerves healthy. He says:
 Because nothing can be allowed to 
interfere with healthy nerves I smoke 
Camels. I have tried them allgiven 
every popular brand a chance to show 
what it can offer. Camels dont upset 
my nerves even when I smoke con

the more I come to appreciate their 
mildness and rich flavor.
Many smokers who have changed to 
Camels report that their nerves are no

Camels yourself. You will find that 
Camels do not jangle your nervesor 
tire your taste.

An Editors Creed
A college editor should take an unbiased stand in man
aging his paper. He should suppress petty obsessions and be
liefs to a broad-minded view on all subjects.
The editor should eliminate all practices harmful to the 
school by airing injurious, action. He should sponsor all move
ments that he believes will further the welfare of the student 
bod}'.
The editor should be free of all shackles that bind him to 
editorial stands that he knows are hot the best. Faculty and 
student organizations should have no censuring hold on him. 
He should constantly strive to reach the point where his state
ments have not been cut by other than his own hands.
Just so long as he acts with, good judgment and uses his 
power unselfishly, let him remain in office; but if ho oversteps 
his bounds by magnifying what are only his personal views and 
sponsoring institutions harmful to the school, then he should be 
removed.
A Pep Redly
Carnegie students have a chance this week to show that 
they are capablc of acting like intelligent men and women and 
thereby embarrass numerous critics of things collegiate. In 
past years, the Pitt game has been the signal for disturbances 
ol! varying degrees. Not always have students been at fault but 
those who shake heads solemnly and view with alarm ac
tions ol! those college students rarely bother to learn the' 
true cause ol! such disturbances.
Some take particular delight in connecting Carnegies 
name with, such celebrations becanso oi! its reputation as a 
technical sehool and tho recognized seriousness of its student 
body.
College students chafe at restrictions yet at tho first excuse 
are apt to disport themselvos in a manner befitting high school 
students. Tlioso who are not too far removed from collogo 
days will recognize that football celebrations play but a small 
part in tho life ol' any student. Win or loso on tho gridiron, 
classes meet as usual, assignments aro to bo mot and quizzos 
passed.
Enthusiasm over a football game can bo interpreted as a 
healthy sign and when guided into proper channels has a very 
definite place in tho student's program, Thorp remains only 
the problem ol finding an orderly outlet1 for tho enthusiasm of 
those of tho studont body not on tho team, Tho players will 
have plenty oil opportunity to work off their enthusiasm on the 
gridiron Thursday, For tho rest, a Pep [Rally on tho campus 
has boon planned for tomorrow aftornoon. Wo boliovo it will 
(ill a well defined need.
Rushing Sham
Hushing season reaches its stride next Monday morning 
at 8:30 and continues a tiring pace until tho following Satur
day. What will tho outcome boV With few out-of-town men 
whose pledging moans tho survival of Iho house, .competition 
will bo at its keenest. Houses will make more than an ordinary 
effort to impress tho freshmen. It will bo increasingly difficult 
for the rushoo to see through fho excitement the real condition 
of tho house and the quality of its men.
It has become the fashion with tho majority of houses at 
Carnegie to drop most of the sham and adopt a frank policy 
in presenting their group to tho rusliee. But in many eases 
where it is the question of shamming to entice the unsuspect
ing victim or continuing under the shadow of the mortgage 
collector, the most obvious route is taken and the rusliee is 
carried away with false information.
To contend -with this evil, the rusliee should enter rushing 
week thoroughly equipped to interpret, through the finely, the 
true value of the houses he visits. He should not be in such 
distant relationship1 with fraternities that lie is completely swept 
off his feet when he is rushed. Perhaps a frank financial state
ment from all the fraternity houses and an accurate list of 
present membership would do much to enlighten the rusliee.
Why Deprive the School and Yourself?
As one retrospects on the events which have passed dur
ing a normal college course it becomes only too evident that 
those things which were considered all important at the mo
ment become dwarfed and insignificant when they are com
pared with the results of seemingly unimportant events. To 
the average freshman the outstanding moments of his career 
are the horrors before exams, the anticipation of vacations and 
the anxiety for fraternal relationships. Granted that all items 
are of importance, we find that tho plebe is so absorbed in these 
things that ho overlooks ono of tho major benefits of his collego 
daysextra-curricular activities,
Tho experience gained through service on publications, for 
example, gives tho studont training in linos other than aro 
offered in tho classroom and brings him into contact with peo
ple from all parts of tho school, thereby broadening his out
look on things in general, lie learns to talk to tho person he 
is interviewing and become at ease in tho company of others, 
regardless of how high a position they might occupy. Tho 
classroom offers little of this.
The managers of sports loarn tho rudiments of handling 
the finances for trips and are in contact with many of the men 
at the helm of a college. Class Offices and student representa
tion teach those interested tho qualifications for leadership.
It is unfortunate that many students who come to school 
and are qualified for participation in activities deprive both 
themselves and the student body of mutual advantages. If they 
do not fill those jobs which they are capable of handling some 
one else must. In many cases the laissez faire attitude of the 
student body forces men who are not of the best available 
material to be placed in positions of importance.
It does not seem logical that those who have ability should 
not exercise it for their own and the schools benefit.
