from the campus immediately fol
lowing the parade.
Entering Frosh Spring Carnival Promises
To Be Housed 1 
In Dormitories T. O Be The B est In Years
Dorm Council Suggests 
Doubling, Tripling, Or 
Moving Out Frat Men
The administration announced 
that all entering out of town 
freshmen will be required to live 
in campus dorms next year. This, 
coupled with the razing of the B 
wing of the barracks this sum
mer, may present a serious hous
ing problem to upperclassmen 
even though the number of fresh
men asking for rooms is expect
ed to drop.
Since the problem affects dorm 
men, Dormitory Council was ask
ed to consider it and present a 
possible solution. The solution 
the Dorm Council committee 
worked out should provide rooms 
for all the men who would other
wise be forced to find rooms offcampus.
By changing the larger tworoom suites so that, they can ac
commodate three, and by putting 
an extra bed and desk into some 
of the large single rooms, the 
committee says that 50 to 60 ex
tra men could be accommodated, 
the number expected to be with
out rooms otherwise. One advan
tage of doubling and tripling 
would be the reduction of the 
rent.
One problem yet to be solved 
is that the fraternities need to 
have their houses filled for finan
cial purposes. Previously, fresh
men were permitted to stay at 
the fraternity houses before and 
during pledging, but this will no 
longer be done. Therefore it has 
been suggested that the Greeks 
take some of their upperclassmen 
out of the dorms and into the 
houses to allow room for more 
freshmen.

Veterans!
Veterans are reminded they 
will be paid 15 days leave at the 
end of this semester, and this 
period will be deducted from 
their entitlement, unless they 
cancel the leave at least 30 days 
in advance.
Veterans desiring interruption

10. Forms are available in the 
veterans office, 132D Industries 
Hall.
Scholarships
Mortar Board is awarding a 
$100 scholarship to a junior 
woman in any of the four col
leges for her senior year. The 
scholarship will be awarded 
this spring to a girl meeting 
the qualifications specified by 
Mortar Board.
The applicant must have a
2.75 average factor for the 
two previous semesters. The 
scholarship will be awarded 
on the basis of service and 
leadership which the woman 
has shown in he* school ac
tivities.
Mortar Board has found it 
possible to award the scholar
ship this year because of the 
profit made on the King of 
Hearts ball. One hundred dol
lars of the profit has been set 
aside for the scholarship, and 
the remainder has been put in 
the scholarship fund of the 
Womens Guild.
Applications may be secured 
in the Dean of Mens Office 
on or after May 15.
Carnival Program 
Includes Dances, 
Booths, Parade
Everything is set for a great 
Carnival. From the time when the 
holiday starts with the opening of 
the Midway on Thursday after
noon to the end of the Saturday 
night dance starring Art Lund, the 
program is calculated to pro
vide long remembered entertain
ment.
The big events on the program 
are the three dances on Friday 
and Saturday nights. Friday night 
dancing will take place under the 
stars in front of Fine Arts and will 
be informal. In case of rain the 
dance will be held in the Fine Arts 
foyer. Jack Purcell will lead the 
band with Bette Smiley doing the 
vocals.
In Both Gyms
On Saturday night, dancing will 
take place in both the mens and 
womens gyms with Art Lund, 
singing star of such hit tunes as 
Mamselle and On a Slow Boat 
to China, headling the musicmakers for the evening. Milton Starr 
and his orchestra will accompany 
Lund in the mens gym while 
Walt Harper will play in the 
womens "gym.
Dress for men is optional, al
though it is expected most will be 
in tuxedos with women in formals. 
Tickets for the dances are now 
available in Skibo during the 
lunch hours for $4.25.
Old Favorites
Five rides and over twenty 
booths with prizes galore will 
provide continuous entertainment 
during the entire Carnival. Old 
favorites like the Duck-a-Beta 
and DU Eight Ball booths will 
again test the skill of all as well 
as many new ideas in games of 
skill.
Scheduled for Friday is the 
Queen coronation, preliminary 
pushmobile heats, and the float 
parade. Varsity Varieties, and the 
finals of the Sweepstakes will 
highlight the entertainment on 
Saturday afternoon.
Senior Dance 
Now Scheduled 
For June 13
Mortar Board has announced 
that the Senior Ball is expected to 
be a reality on June 13. Although 
the return of the cards sent out 
by Mortar Board is not enough to 
defray the expenses, it is hoped 
that the difference will be made 
up by others who have not yet 
I returned their cards. As yet only 
I 200 cards have been returned out 
I of the 900 sent out. 
j The dance will take place after 
j the Baccalaureate from 9:30 to 
j 12:00 p. m. on June 13 at the 
Schenley Ballroom. Tickets will 
go on sale within a few weeks at 
$2.00 apiece. Because the school 
has dropped sponsorship of the 
I dance, it is now necessary to 
I charge admission, although in pre
vious years the senior dance has 
been free to the graduating stu
dents. Tickets will be sold only 
! to senior, graduate, and graduating 
i night school students.
The dance, which is now sponI sored by Mortar Board, will be 
informal because of the inconvenj ience of wearing formal attire .o 
Baccalaureate.

TAWA1VWEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1950
Editorials
Vi liicii (koines First
The recently announced plan of housing all 
freshmen on campus for their first semester in 
school, beginning next year, has brought justified 
murmurs of dissention from both the fraternities 
and from present dorm residents.
As far as the purpose of the proposed plan 
is concerned, there can be no question but 
that housing: of all freshmen together for the 
first semester is a worthy project. Difficulties 
have been encountered in the past two years 
with the increasing numbers of younger 
freshmen enrolling at Carnegie. Lack of proer dormitory facilities forced many of these 
freshmen to move into boarding houses 
which were quite distant from campus. This 
not only gave new students a bad first im
pression of Carnegie Tech, but decreased the 
effectiveness of the freshmen orientation 
program in helping the teen-ager adjust to 
the jump from high school to college.
What must eventually be done is clear! It is 
only in the mechanics of the project that the 
proposed plan is sorely in need of adjustment. 
By keeping freshmen out of fraternities for an 
entire semester, the school administration 
would create a financial problem for the larger 
houses which must depend on six to ten fresh
men living in their house. Although it has been 
suggested that these fraternities move their upperclass members who live in the dorms into the 
house, this would not only be unfair to the men 
who prefer to live in dorms, but would not be 
a solution for the larger fraternities which are 
presently housing almost all of their members 
who live on campus.
Probably the only feasible solution, and 
one that the Council of Fraternity Presidents 
is presently working on, is for the school to 
permit freshmen to move from a dorm into 
a fraternity house during the week following 
pledging. In other words, give the freshman 
an option on a dorm which must be picked 
up or dropped by a certain date.
The problem facing junior and senior dorm 
residents is more easily solved, although it may 
present inconveniences to a few. According to 
present figures available on dorm spaces which 
will be in use next year, the total dorm and 
fraternity space will not board all the students 
desiring; housing. This means that there will be 
upperclassmen who will have to move off campus 
for rooms. A proposed solution from Iiorm Coun
cil of doubling and tripling-up in some of the 
rooms appears to provide the best solution to 
this problem.
Before definitely deciding on enforcing 
this new ruling for next year's incoming 
freshmen class, the administration must solve 
the two problems facing them. By going 
ahead without consideration for both the 
fraternities and present dorm residents, the 
administration would be stepping on the toes 
of more people than they would be helping. 
What a difference a year makes!
Big Change
It was only last year that one of the biggest 
political campaigns ever, hit the Carnegie cam
pus during the week preceding Student Council 
election. This year all has changed. Not only is 
there little of any campaigning being done, but 
there were not even enough petitions received 
to fill the council seats which will be vacant fol
lowing this semester.
Either we are losing our political leaders 
or Student Council has finally come to mean 
nothing of importance to the student body.

Letters To The Editor
Tartan Censored 
For Gross Error
A week or two ago the Tartan was the sub
ject of the inquiring reporters column. At that 
time the majority of the students interviewed 
expressed their approval of the paper. Its a 
shame that this poll was held before the issue of 
May 2! In this issue one finds in the Tartan the 
evidences of the same disease which seems to 
afflict all campus organizations, that is, the sleep
ing sickness. Someone must have been asleep 
when an article is printed on May 2 about an 
opera to be presented on April 1. With scoops 
such as this the Tartan, like Student Council, 
will soon be busy providing reasons for its ex
istence. Perhaps, like Council though, it does 
not need reasons for existence since it is dead 
already.
Sincerely,
H. Justin Davidson.
(Ed. noteThe Tartan blushed in its brightest 
red following the error which reader Davidson 
refers to in his letter above. However, it was a 
technical error in the make-up of the paper which 
allowed such a mistake to be printed unnoticed, 
and is certainly not of the magnitude nor impor
tance to permit the seemingly final stamp of dis
approval which has been indicated in his letter.
Firm in the conviction that the Tartan has 
lived up to its purpose by publishing, in news
paper form, news, notices, features, and inter
pretation of the news,, of the student body, we 
openly challenge reader Davidson to furnish the 
evidence on which he bases his charges.)
Carnival Setup 
Draws Complaint
As a member of a social fraternity on this 
campus, I would like to voice my complaint 
over the manner in which this years Spring 
Carnival Committee is attempting to make Car
nival a financial success.
My number one gripe is that the budgeting 
committee has looked in the wrong direction in 
attempting to make money. In previous years 
there were no entry fees for organizations who 
wished to participate in either the float parade 
or sweepstakes race. Instead, it was considered 
that the efforts of these organizations in putting 
out their best for the parade, buggy race*, and 
midway was more than enough. In fact, a cash 
award was presented to the winning organiza
tion in the float parade. This also has been dis
continued.
While there can be no doubt that the attempts 
of Spring Carnival Committee to send this car
nival over the top are well and good, it is also 
very clear that they are taking the easiest way 
out in throwing the added burden on the very 
organizations which have given 100 per cent 
support in the past. Why not spread the extra 
cost out more evenly among the student body.
Signed, An Irate Student.
35 Years Ago 
In The Tartan
After much discussion and'cam
paigning, the mens dormitories 
were to be built at last. Director 
Hammerschlag had arranged for 
the construction of two buildings, 
each to house one hundred stu
dents. The dorms were to be com
fortable, hygienic, and demo
cratic.
There would be no rich-man 
or poor-man units. Each stu
dent would be free to come and 
go as he pleased. Carnegie depend
ed on the discretion and sense of 
proportion of each student, to 
govern him.
The Radio Club heard Willard 
put the kibosh on Johnson in 
the 26th round on their experi
mental receiving set. This set was 
built from odds and ends brought 
in by the members.
A letter to the editor complained 
of the high cost of food in the 
so-called non-profit cafeterias on 
campus.
In' order to raise $100 for the 
Lillian Rest Home, the Womens 
Guild was to hold a carnival on 
the following Wednesday. Fortune 
telling, a fashion show, and a taxi 
dance were planned. Pictures of 
professors were to be hung on the 
walls, and students could throw 
three baseballs at the faces for 
five cents.
Princetonian frosh were not per
mitted to participate in baseball 
on campus, use the main walks, 
wear silk hats, or play marbles, 
the latter privilege being reserved 
for upperclassmen. .
In the Pittsburgh Athletic As
sociation Track Meet at the Duquesne Gardens, Jack L. King of 
Carnegie Tech broke the high 
jump record with a leap of five 
feet ten inches.

STRAIGHT JACKETS FOR CAR

Committee is cracking up under 
the strain. Bob Sinclair sauntered 
into the Dean of Mens office and 
began hanging paper airplanes 
from the lights and pasting pen

THEN THERES THE FLAG . . . 
Last week a student wrote a letter 
to the editor complaining about 
the condition of our flag and ask
ing why it was flown at half-mast 
so frequently. The flag is lowered 
at half-mast in commenoration of 
a death on campus. This year sev
en faculty members, four of the 
Board of Trustees and two stu
dents have died. Incidentally, the 
flag now waving over the Fine 
Arts lawn appears to be brand 
new.
SPRING FEVER ... A feature
writer for the Los Angeles Col

in the man-napping technique. He 
wrote, Report to the track coach 
for a few laps around the track. 
Good advice in the spring, hmm?

IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS . . .
The oval court in front of Mar

Tickets
There are a few tickets still 
available for tonight and 
Wednesdays presentation of 
Scotch and Sodas production 
Too Much. These can be 
purchased in Skibo at the 
Scotch and Soda booth.
Show This Evening Climaxes Eight Months Of Planning; 
Audiences Will Be Final Judges Of Success Or Failure
A dream or a nightmare? These last 10 days have made the Scotch n Soda cast 
and crews wonder. Today they look forward to. the opening performance of Too Much 
with mingled emotions. There is in their minds a mixture of confidence and doubt,
?of happiness and sorrow, of fever
ish excitement and complete exhaustion.
Eight months ago this day seem
ed ages off! The show was just 
in the idea stage, and the only 
ones on campus cognizant that an 
organization called Scotch n Soda 
was in operation were those on 
the executive board and the au
thors of the show. The job then 
was one of planning and prepar
ing for tryouts. Though days were 
slipping by rapidly, the jobs were 
slowly shaping up, and the second 
week in May still seemed a long 
way off.
Birth Pangs
Tryouts were held, and for the 
first time the campus became 
aware of the 1950 Scotch n Soda 
production. Since that time  with 
a few exceptions when crew calls 
went out  the work of this show 
has gone on unnoticed by the gen
eral student body. The days'coni 
tinued to slip by rapidly, and what | 
| seemed like next year became next
LOVE BLOSSOMS
Above, they have found each other at last. Love blossoms for 
Gretchen Schmertz and Jack Hill, two intellectual but socially stupid 
individuals. (Only in Too Much, of course). In the background 
are Toni Landergott, Jim Fleming, Chuck Tritlc, Marcie Helwig, 
Linda Cowan, and Bob Sitler. They are singing and strumming 
the refrain to the 4.00 Factor Blues. This skit finds Gretch and 
Jack with % mutual interest in things prehistoric.
Scotch and Soda's stage and set crews had the job of converting a 
35x15 hole-in-the-wall into a full fledged stage. Th diminutive
gym-stage gave Dave Clark, Immero Fiorentino and Joe Jennings | month, next week, tomorrow, and
a gigantic space problem.
The walls and ceiling were bar-* 
ren of any of the necessary fix
tures for setting up curtains, lights, 
etc. . . . There was also the little 
detail of designing the stage so 
that some 1200 people could see.
Must Be Small
The limitations of the gym stage 
made several hardships necessary. 
Dressing rooms would have to be 
far off-stage; several rooms were 
loaned to SnS for that purpose. 
Set pieces would have to be as 
lightweight and thin as possible to 
permit storage. This was vital 
since about 90 percent of the setpieces would have to be stacked 
right on the stage; hidden, yet 
practically under the eyes of the 
audience. To make room for the 
set-pieces, the stage frontage visi 
ible to the audience was made 
smaller. Several of the sets were 
built to be dropped into place like 
curtains. The few pieces small 
enough were stored out in the hall
way along with the props.
Production work began in earn
est shortly after the Easter vaca
tion. SnS shared the main gym 
floor with Spring Carnivals Dance 
decoration committee. The week 
before the show the gym floor was 
littered from front to back with 
piles of drapes, lumber, and odd
shaped flats. It looked like the 
aftermath of a tornado and drew
gasps from the janitors and watch
men.
One Happy
Gradually, as the ninth neared, 
order began to rear its welcome 
head. The piles of raw materials 
diminished, while the rows of flats 
and set-pieces grew.
As in most difficult projects, 
there was one person who was 
satisfied with his lot, the lighting
now  tonight. It has arrived 
suddenly, faster than anyone re
alized.
To the paying audience, Too 
Much" mustlike any other stage 
production  stand on its own 
merits. Is the music good? Are 
the skits funny? Could I hear, 
could I see? Did I enjoy the show? 
These things are of importance, 
and on such grounds the show 
will be judged.
Through The Night
Long, long hours in rehearsal, 
painting set pieces, collecting 
props, rigging lights, and the 1000

However, the question is always i 
before them  will the audience 
like it? And so there is doubt.
It is hard to describe the feel1 
ings of many of those who have 
worked on Too Much. They 
want it to be good, to provide a 
lot of laughs and a barrel of catchy 
tunes. But equally important, the3' 
want to have fun doing it. As a 
student activity, Scotch n Soda 
has no place unless it satisfies 
this requirement.
Common Cause
There is a friendship built up 
among those in the cast and on 
the crews which is strengthened 
by having worked hard together 
on a job as enormous as this. Each 
guy and gal is important, whether

As suggested by the title. We

appeared that Too Much needed 
greater length. Successive treat

his first opportunity to wield the

The skit presents as diverse a 
group of characters as appear 
anywhere in the show. Dodo Mar

both the audience and the rest of 
council with her mobile facial ex
pressions while she reads the min

on the stage. He even brings his 
own secretary (Bootsie Steven

plays the illiterate Mr. Y who 
opposes Mr. X at every turn.
Tied In Chair
Despite the obvious dislike of 
the members for organized order, 
they do have a parliamentarian 
whose duty it is to supply the 
president with pertinent proced

duty well  so well that council 
has her chained in her chair for 
full time parliainentarizing.

4TASWANWEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1950
The large number of outstanding candidates for the Car
negie Tartan Outstanding Intramural Athlete of the Year 
Award has brought to light a situation on this campus that 
is discouraging to say the least. If these intramural athletes 
are so proficient in so many sports, why are they not partici
pating in at least one varsity sport?
This question is asked not only of the 14 athletes nominated 
for the Tartan award but also of a great many other intramural 
enthusiasts who have not been considered for the honor. This 
latter group may not be standouts in several sports, but they un
doubtedly excel in one or two sports that have assumed a var
sity status at Carnegie.
Of course, it is to be expected that many of those par
ticipating in intramurals will use the excuse that they dont 
have time enough to compete on a varsity level. However, 
it is felt here that, if those students who persist in using this 
alibi were to determine the time they spend on intramural 
athletics, they would find that the total would be more than 
enough time necessary to compete in a varsity sport.
If it is recognition that these athletes desire, it is cer
tainly more feasible to expect to find such recognition forth
coming by participating in varsity sports than in intra
murals. A greater number of students definitely are more 
cognizant of the ability of a varsity athlete than of an intra
mural athlete.
This discussion is in no way a criticism of the intramural 
program at Carnegie. This program definitely has a prominent 
role in college life, and should be present for those students 
who enjoy athletics but are not equipped to participate in 
varsity sports. Rather, this article is intended to urge those 
athletes with the required ability to utilize their talents in a 
more advantageous manner, namely, through participation in 
varsity athletics.
Singer Art Lund Star Athlete
Art Lund, the featured vocalist at Spring Carnival, was 
an outstanding athlete during his college days. Standing 
six feet, four inches tall, it was inevitable that Lund attain 
sport honors in high school and college.
He attended East Kentucky State College and won letters 
in football, baseball, tennis, swimming, track, and boxing. For 
his outstanding performance on the gridiron, Lund was nominated 
to the Little All-America eleven. After graduation he was sup
posed to play football for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but a knee in
jury force} him to give-up the game.

Foul Shooting 
Championship
The intramural foul shooting 
contest was climaxed by an excit
ing play-off between Bud Pelle
grini and Hans Ackerman, both of 
the championship Phi Kappa foul 
shooting team.
The playoff, which became nec
essary when these two men both 
recorded scores of 89 out of a pos
sible 100 for the two round elim
ination matches, resulted in both 
men displaying amazing exhibi
tions of accuracy with the basket
ball.
Ackerman exhibited his usual 
cool style of shooting in the first 
half of the playoff round, record
ing a fine score of 47 out of a pos
sible 50. A few minutes later, 
however, Pellegrini came back to 
shoot an amazing 49 out of the 
possible 50. This is a record for 
the foul shooting championships 
at CIT.

Allegheny First Defeat
Led once again by Jim Andrews, the Carnegie Tech track team 
gained its second win of the season last Saturday by defeating pre
viously unbeaten Allegheny. 69-62.
Andrews tallied 17 points in pacing the Plaid to the win over 
the Gators, taking first place in*
the broad jump, low hurdles, and 
pole vault. The versatile star also 
took third place honors in the shot 
put, high hurdles, and discus.
Carnegies Connie Hammann 
broke the Allegheny track record 
in the 120-yard low hurdles by 
winning the event in the credit
able time of 16 seconds. Ham
mann also tied with Fritz Wilson 
for first place in the high jump.

Six First String Men Missing As 
Plaid Drops Pitt, Duquesne Games
In Dual Meet
The Bethany track and field 
team made a clean sweep of the 
track events as they defeated the 
Tartan thinclads 77i-531/ last 
Tuesday. Reversing the general 
procedure the Skibos swept the 
weight events.
Jim Andrews again topped the 
scoring column with a total of 20 
points. Andrews placed first in 
two events, second in three events, 
and third in one event. Fritz Wil
son accounted for 6 Vi points with 
two second places and a tie for 
third.
For the first time in four weeks 
"Wilson failed to win the 220. He 
placed second behind Davis of 
Bethany whose time was a com
mendable 22.6 seconds. Davis also 
placed first in the 100 yard dash 
for Bethany in 10.2 seconds as 
Luchock placed third.
The Plaid took first and second 
place in the broad jump, Andrews 
leaping 20'5114" and Wilson fol
lowing an inch behind. Halfertys 
men took first and second places 
in the discus throw, Andrews and 
Jim Trautman placing first and 
second respectively.
John Cooper failed to hit his 
time of 10:57 made in the two 
mile event last week and was 
forced to relinquish first and sec
ond places to Bethany with a 
10:59.2 mark. Cooper also placed 
third in the mile event. Connie 
Hamman placed second in the 220 
low hurdles and Andrews placed 
third.
Carnegie gridders put the final touch to spring training Sat
urday as they stubornly fell before the Pitt Jayvees 13-6. Earlier 
in the week the Duquesne 11 claimed a 12-0 victory over the Tar
tans. The Baker men had defeated the Duquesne Jayvees by the 
same score. ? "
In the backfield Irving Schechter and August DeGiovanni pro
vided the punch for the Plaid in 
the absence of Luchok, Dissen, 
Simcic, and Metzger. Johnny Lu
chok is suffering a leg injury as 
a result of last weeks track meet 
with Bethany, while Gil Dissen 
was out of the lineup with an 
ankle injury.
Many Out
Both Nick Simcic and Elmer 
Metzger have been absent from 
the backfield this spring along 
with linemen Floyd Wisemen and 
Larry Stovicek. End Fritz Wilson, 
in lending his talented legs to the 
track team this spring, has failed 
to appear in the last two games.
Simcic is resting from a knee 
operation while Wisemen is still 
recovering from a leg injury in
curred last fall. It is hoped that 
these men will be fully recovered 
by the end of the summer. Both 
Metzger and Stovicek have been 
too busy with their studies to ap
pear in spring training.
The first quarter in the game 
with the Pitt Jayvees was dom
inated by Pitt as they registered 
three first downs to none for Car
negie. Pitt halfback OBara ac
counted for the ground gains as 
he skirted the end for 50 yards 
on the third play.
Carnegie Scores 
In the last minute of the quarter 
OBara again went 50 yards and 
scored the first touchdown of the 
game. Halfback Fyock broke 
through for the extra point.
Coming to life in the second 
period, the Plaid 11 stopped the 
Jayvees, recovering a Pitt fumble. 
On the next play Schechter took 
the ball on a handoff and raced 45 
yards around left end for the 
Skibo tally. An attempted pass 
for the extra point failed.
One Called Back 
Minutes later DeGiovanni took 
the ball off tackle from midfield 
to the Pitt five yard line, only to 
be called back on a holding pen
alty. The final TD came in the 
last period as Pitts Fyock scored. 
The extra point attempt failed.
Pitt registered 10 first downs 
and completed four or seven pass 
attempts while the Tartans made 
only four first downs and two of 
six pass attempts. Despite the de
feats and absence of key men, Dr. 
Baker believes a great deal has 
been accomplished this spring.
This past week has been a banner week for Coach Frank Moses 
and his Tartan tennis squad. They engaged in three matches and 
emerged victors in all three.
On Wednesday the Skibos entertained the Geneva Covies for
?their opening home match and 
found considerable opposition to 
be overcome before they finally 
won by an 8-1 count.
Freshman Bob Weiderhorn, sla
ted for the first singles spot by 
Coach Moses, lived up to all ex
pectations, downing his opponent 
6-0, 6-2.
Shoemaker Wins
Ed Shoemaker quickly followed 
in Weiderhorns path by defeating 
a stubborn rally in the first set 
to win the match 6-4. Shoemaker 
solved his opponents style and 
subdued him in the second set by 
a 6-0 score.
After losing the first set, John 
Montstream, playing in the third 
singles position, came back fight
ing to win the next two sets, and 
the match, the score of 3-6, 
6-0, 6-0.
Another freshman, Tom Latta, 
quickly got rid of his opponent 
by the scores of 6-0, 6-4.
Tough Going 
A1 Moon, playing in the number 
five spot, encountered the hardest 
opposition in the entire match. 
Moon took the first set by a 6-2 
score, but he could not stop the 
stubborn comeback of his Geneva 
opponent. The match was con
cluded when Mclsaac of Geneva 
finally won out by 7-5, 6-4 scores.
Bob Bassett, playing as number 
six man for Coach Moses, recorded 
CITs fifth win when he posted 
victories of 6-1 and 7-5.
Win Doubles 
Weiderhorn and Montstream 
paired up to form the first doubles 
team, and they had little trouble 
in defeating the Covie first doub
les team by 6-0 and 6-2 scores.
In the second doubles match 
Shoemaker and Latta teamed up 
to beat their opponents by 6-1, 6-2 
counts.
Bassett and Moon concluded the 
days activities as they bettered 
the Geneva third doubles team by 
the scores of 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
Two More Wins 
Friday the Tartan netmen trav
eled to Thiel where they found 
little opposition, posting a 9-0 win 
over the Thielmen.
Grove City played host to a 
fighting squad from CIT last Sat
urday, and the Tartans kept their 
record for the week clean as they 
emerged the victors, 7-2.
The Grovers scored their only 
triumphs in singles matches. It 
[Continued on page 6]
The meet was bitterly contested 
throughout, with the outcome in 
doubt until the final two events. 
Anchor man Fred Price fought off 
a stirring, last-minute challenge 
by Alleghenys John Bozic to give 
the Tartans the mile relay win 
that sank the Gators. Andrews 
broad jump win confirmed the vic
tory.
John Cooper turned in his best 
time of the season in winning the 
two-mile run in 11:06.3. Cooper 
also placed third in the mile run. 
The other win in the track events 
was furnished by Fritz Wilson, 
who copped the 220-yard dash.
Once again the Tartans proved 
to be weakest in the weight 
events, with Allegheny taking all 
three first places in the javelin, 
shot put, and discus. In fact, the 
Gators gained first, second, and 
third places in the javelin.
George Main was Alleghenys

proved Coach Overends choice to 
be a wise one by playing Nagy, 
the Geneva ace, to a standstill.
First Men Tie 
Although Nagy fired a 73 as 
compared to Curtis 74, each won 
the same number of holes, the only 
point of significance in match
play. The draw between these two 
gave each team V2 point.
Ryabik, posting a 76, had no 
trouble defeating Genevas Rendee 
in match play. The combined ef
forts of Curtis and Ryabik against 
Nagy and Rendee were good 
enough to give the Plaid another 
point.
Rich Johnson, Tartan number 
three man, and Ed Denberg, play
ing in the fourth spot, took the 
measure of Bell and Stevens of 
the Covenanters, giving the Skibos 
three more points. Johnson played 
one of his best games since join
ing the team, turning in a 75 for 
his days efforts.
Heavy Week
Dave Dander and Don Meyers 
garnered the remainder of the 
points for the Plaid by outplaying 
their opponents completely. Dan

Race Picks Up 
Momentum
Emanon Loses Close 
Game To Tau Delts; 
Gringos Beat ATO 7-3
The intramural softball race 
picked up momentum this week 
with five games reported played, 
contrasted with three last week. 
However, the season has yet to get 
into full swing. The week after 
Spring Carnival has 30 games 
scheduled on the CIT diamonds.
This weeks games displayed 
plenty of the expected excitement, 
but little softball. In five games 
a total of 100 runs crossed home 
plate, an average of twenty per 
game. It should be safe to predict 
that in the coming weeks this 
average will be lowered some
what.
In the closest game, of the week, 
Tau Delta Phi, who lost last week 
in a close game to Theta Xi, moved 
into the victory column with a 
10-9 win over Emanon. Tiger 
Smollen, the winning pitcher, won 
his own game in the ninth in
ning with a triple with the bases 
occupied.
Perhaps the best played game 
of the week took place between 
ATO and the Gringos with the 
Gringos coming out on the long 
end of a 7-3 score.

FOUR BARBERS TO 
SERVE YOU
If Youre Particular, See the
TECH BARBER SHOP
Corner of Craig and Forbes
Andrews is number one man 
of the Tartan track team. What 
is* more, many people in the 
know feel hat he could be num
ber one man on a great many 
college . track teams. But dont 
take our word, heres evidence.
A Past Foe
A few years back a mediocre 
Geneva College team faced a fav' 
ored Tartan thinclad squad at 
Skibo Bowl. Andrews, then a 
freshman at Geneva, was making 
his first appearance for the Covies.
When the meet ended, the Tar1 
tans had missed victory by one 
Jim Andrews. The New Brighton ! 
speedster scored three first places, 
four seconds, and one third to lead 
the Covie conquest.
But now Andrews is on our side 
of the fence, and he hasnt lost ' 
his touch.
Jim Andrews value to the track 
team does not lie in his ability in 
any one event. He is a jack of 
all trades who can usually reg
ister a second or  third in any 
event he enters.
Considering that under local 
rules a man may run in as many 
events as he wants, one can easily 
see where Andrews, who is proj 
fieient in 10, is a great asset to  
any coach.
Versatility Plus
Yes, when you talk about verj 
satility, its hard to beat Andrews. ! 
So far in his short stay at Car! 
negie he has performed the disj 
cus, shot-put, javelin, pole vault, 
broadjump, high hurdles, low 
hurdles, hundred yard dash, two' 
twenty yard dash, and various j 
j relay events. In fact, the only 
j thing he has not done is distance | 
running.
Even more amazing is his track I 
i background, or lack of back! 
! ground. For Andrews, track life i 
I began at 20 (he is now 25). He ! 
I did no running at high school, i 
j nor during his pre-war stay at 
1 Geneva.
His first track competition came 
| during a two year stint in the 
| Marine Corps. There he raced 
! occasionally in inter-camp events.
When he returned to Geneva 
! after his discharge, he went out 
! for track and almost immediately 
i became the Covies number one 
man. Aided by his talented ver
satility, Geneva became a local 
power and went undefeated 
through one season. That year 
they lost the Tri-State champion
ships by one point.
The answer to Andrews brilI liance is natural ability, the sub| stance which every great cham
pion must possess. He has the 
rare gift of being almost perfectly 
coordinated and perhaps, under 
long, rigorous tutelage, could be
come a known multi-event man.
Unfortunately for Carnegie, 
Andrews will graduate this June 
to pursue a career in chemical 
I engineering. We can be pretty 
sure that the local thinclads will 
have to look a long way to find 
an athlete the equal of Jim An
drews.

Delts Win National League Title 
Tn Campus Soccer Competition
Defeat Sigma Nu, Kappa Sigs In Final Test; 
Emanon Leads Theta Xi In Amerean League
The intramural soccer program approached an end this past 
week with play ending in the National league and with only a few 
games remaining in the American league.
In the National league the Delts finished first with a record of
five victories and one defeat. Ad
vanced to the playoff round they 
are keeping alive their hopes of a 
repeat performance of last years 
soccer championship.
Sigma Nu and Phi Kappa tied 
for second place with records of 
three wins and one loss each.
Win Clqe One 
The Delts cinched the title on 
Thursday, defeating Kappa Sigma 
in a tight game, 1-0. However, 
the crucial victory in their title 
run was the 2-1 defeat on Wed
nesday of Sigma Nu. their closest 
competitor.
In a close, hard fought game 
Sigma Nu took a first half lead 
of 1-0 on a corner kick by Maxton.
The second half saw Delta Tau 
Delta come back to tie and win 
the game on two field goals, both 
by Don Braun.
Important Game 
Emanon seems headed for the 
American League title. Dependent 
upon the results, which were too 
late for publication, of yesterdays 
game with Theta Xi, Emanon with 
a present 5-0 record will have 
won the championship, or tied 
with Theta Xi, which has a pres
ent 4-1 record.
Emanon continued its winning ; Emanon 
ways during the week with its 1 Theta Xl
Xi, who had previously lost to 
ATO, hit stride again, winning 
two 4-0 games, from Pi Kappa 
Alpha and Beta Sigma Rho.
Playoffs Soon 
The playoffs for the school soc
cer champion will take place 
sometime this week with Delta 
Tau Delta meeting the winner of 
the American league. If Emanon 
wins this league, the playoffs will 
be a repeat of last year. As yet, no 
definite time has been set for the 
plaj'off.

Plaid Drops Match To 
Pitt Team By 48 Pins
During the past two weeks Car
negie Tech has been represented 
on the hardwood alleys by a team 
of six bowlers who excelled in 
this particular sport during the re
cent intramural bowling competi
tion.
Two weeks ago the Tartan 
bowlers met with an aggregation 
of Pitt men, and it was only after 
a bitter struggle that the Skibos 
lost out by the close count of 48 
pins for the three game match.
Last Saturday at Gannon Col
lege in' Erie, Pa., CIT was again 
represented in the district colle
giate bowling competitions. Al
though each man exhibited his 
best style, the combination of 
strange alleys and extremely 
rough competition proved to be 
too much for the Skibo represen
tatives.
Ray Carey and Ed Schwendner 
scored a fifth place in the first 
heat of the doubles competitions. 
In the ensuing heats the men of 
CIT were unable to walk off yvith 
any of the dinners laurels.
Along with Carey and Schwend
ner, who bowled for Emanon and 
Sigma Nu respectively during the 
intramural tournament, the team 
was composed of Paul Weber, 
Delta Tau Delta; Bill Repovz and 
Jack Collins, Phi Kappa; Ludi 
Benner, Theta Xi; and Charles 
Cooke, a freshman newcomer to 
the hardwood lanes.

Margaret Morrison, Queen Isobel' 
taught home economics in North 
Braddock Junior High School un
til she married J. B. Haines. She 
now resides in Sewickley, Penn
sylvania, with her husband and 
three children, Ann, James, and 
Bruce.
1931 and Carnival again! Eliza
beth Steele smiled at her court. 
But time, did not stand still; the 
days at .Margaret Morrison are a 
memory to Elizabeth, who teaches 
secretarial studies at Wilkinsburg j 
High School.
Secretarial Teacher
Another year, another Carnival 
and Mary McKeon was crowned
Queen in 1932. After graduation 
Queen Mary taught secretarial 
subjects in high school until her 
marriage to Harry Kolb when she 
moved to Garden City, New York. 
Mr. Kolb is employed as training 
director by the Esso Standard Oil 
Company, while Mrs. Kolb, queen 
and housewife, cares for her chil
dren, Nancy and David.
Spring Carnival of 1933 featured 
a costume dance, the Highland 
Fling, and the coronation of Kath
erine Wholey as queen. Following 
her graduation, Queen Katherine 
started on a career in fashion as 
a model, commentator, and fashion 
photographer. At present she and 
her husband, J. J. Haney, reside 
in Pittsburgh with their four 
daughters, Kathleen, Constance, 
Joyce, and Lynn.
Crown Too Small
1934, Carnival and calamity! 
Ellen Jane Bishop almost went 
down in campus history as the 
uncrowned queen of 1934. Vir
ginia Artz, an attendant, found 
when she tried to put the crown 
on the Queens head that an error 
had been made in the size, and 
Ellen almost had to wear it as 
a bracelet. Officially crowned 
queen, Ellen Bishop married a 
Carnegie Tech student, C. M. 
Stewart, also .of the class of 1934. 
Preferring a southern climate for 
their boys, Colin and Roger, Mr. 
and Mrs. Stewart traveled to Habana, Cuba, where Mr. Stewart 
became manager-airector of the 
B. F. Goodrich Compapy of Cuba.
Carnival, time in 1950! Once 
again the Queen reigns over the 
Midway, the roaring buggies, and 
the floats. Yet time never stands 
still; soon it will be 1951 and 
Carnival time and Carnival Queen!

A top scholar and ROTC Honor Graduate, Cadet Lt. Col. Nathan Adams enjoyed his final military ball in 1940, soon left for Fort Sills Field Artillery School.
Following a three month course, Lt. Adams decided the Air Force was the place for'him. He applied for pilot training, was accepted, proceeded to Maxwell Field.
He won his wings and reported to the 36tfy Fighter Group in Puerto Rico. The group soon returned to the States, giving Adam* a chance to marry his college sweetheart.
Within months Adams was overseas, flying "rhubarbs (missions against enemy transport). He flew 63 P-47 missions within seven months, returned to the States late in 1944 for rest and recuperation.
V-J Day came, and Adams decided to make the service a career. He choose personnel work as his career field, was as
signed for training to the Adjutant Generals School at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.
Now a regular Air Force Major, he heads a 32-man section at Bolling Air Force Base. He advises his Commanding Officer on selection, assignment and promotion of all officers and airmen in the command.

TAWAIVWEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1950
Dance Loss Solution 
Presented To Council
Lack Of Quorum Cramps Action;
Election Has Too Few Candidates
On May 3 President Koester called to order 16 interested Student 
Council representatives. The 13 other Councilmen apparently put 
their interests above those of their constituents and stayed far enough 
away from the Union so that the quorum of 20 could not be mustered.
Scholarships
All women who have ap
plied for scholarships should 
report to the Dean of Wom
ens office as soon as possible 
to make appointments.
The attending Council members < 
sailed into a discussion of com
mittee reports which included the 
results of an investigation of the 
financial failures of many all 
school social affairs, the coming 
election of Student Council rep
resentatives, and the present 
financial status of school publica
tions.
Dance Suggestions
The plans and programs com
mittee, headed by Fred Lunt, pre
sented its conclusion that the 
prime reasons for the financial 
troubles of the affairs were im
proper scheduling and insufficient 
advertising. The committee pre
sented the following five-point 
program for scheduling next 
terms functions:
1. Reduce the all school danc'es 
from six to five, retaining the 
Military Ball, Homecoming, 
C Club dance, Spring Carni
val, and King of Hearts.
2. Place these five dances on a 
schedule first and at least one 
month apart, keeping the 
week-ends surrounding these 
dances for smaller, self-sup
porting events.
3. Schedule the Pan-Hellenic 
Dance. Greek Sing and 
Swing, and CFP dance as far 
from these five dances as 
possible.
4. Have the social chairman 
personally contact those in 
charge of each social affair 
for the purpose of giving ad
vice on publicity and man
agement, whenever it is de
sired,
5. Give the Kiltie Band and 
Glee Club concerts protection 
by scheduling these as major 
events of the week-end, with 
no competition on the con
cert nights.
Social chairman Stewart will 
present a tentative social calendar 
to determine how closely these 
principles can be followed.
Under-Represented
The Student Council election 
on May 9 has seven candidates 
from Fine Arts vieing for three 
positions, six from MM cam
paigning for three Council seats, 
and two persons attempting to se
cure the position of assistant sec
retary. The situation for E&S, 
however, presents a problem. 
Only eight applications were re
ceived for the ten available Coun
cil seats.
Bob Carpenter, elections chair
man, asked for discussion on the 
possibility of allowing write in 
votes for the two unfilled spots, 
but Council was 11-4 against the 
move, being in favor of accept
ing the eight engineering candi
dates as already elected, subject 
only to Councils final approval.
Save Face
Councilman Moore touched off 
a volley of out of order retorts 
when he suggested Council save 
face in this farce by cancelling 
the engineering elections until 
two more candidates could be 
found. President Koester called 
a halt to the discussion by assert
ing that Council had already ex
pressed its desires on the matter.
Student Council has been ap
propriated $14,200 for the com
ing school year. This is to be al
lotted to the various organizations 
under its supervision. Budget 
chairman Art Zuch reported that 
budgets, which have been care
fully audited, will be brought be
fore Council at the next two meet
ings. Officials of interested or
ganizations will be able to super
vise Council's action on their 
budgets by contacting their repre
sentative or attending the next 
few meetings of Student Council.
Technical Profits
The Technical improved its 
financial position by making up 
half its previous losses on its latest
issue. The Fre'shmen dance 
showed a net profit of $5.14.
Student Council unanimously 
voted to reinstate Councilman 
Crowley. His scholastic standing 
had mado it necessary for him to 
withdraw temporarily. President 
Koester announced that the num
ber of members necessary for a 
! quorum now is 21.
Help!
Are you interested in pub
lication layout work? Then 
the Carnegie Technical has a 
place for you, to complete the 
graduation-depleted ranks of 
its staff. Be sure to attend the 
meeting of those interested at 
12 oclock, Thursday, in the 
Technical office, third floor, 
Carnegie Union.

SLIDE RULES OF THE FUTURE
Shown above are two of the several new electric calculators 
now available to Carnegie students. Able to solve quickly many 
of the more tedious computations faced by the engineer, the machines 
are housed in the statistics lab, IH223-E.* * ** * *
Electric Calculating Machines 
To Ease Strain On Tired Brain
Computers, Open To Students, Shorten Work;
Free Instruction Offered By Two Attendants
Even the water cooled slip stick, proverbial companion in sor
row of the engineer, is losing ground to the Carnegie plan! Several 
new electric calculating machines on campus are now available to 
students to take the dog-work from engineering problems.
Located in the statistics lab,^----------------------------------------------------
IH223-E, the computers can save 
considerable wear and tear on a 
tired Techites brain with their 
rapid fire addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. Al
though cooly indifferent to such 
matters of interest as the weather 
report or Kentucky Derby win
ners, the machines are accurate to 
several decimal places on the more 
conventional types of mathemat
ical problems.
Free Instruction 
Joe Vogan and Jim Griffith, 
who have charge of the lab, will 
be glad to acquaint anyone with 
the more simple operations of the 
calculator. Students interested in 
becoming steady patrons are ad
vised to examine one of the in
struction books to learn how to 
find square and cube roots and do 
specific types of calculations, such 
as compound interest problems or 
amortization scheduling.
According to Griffith and Vogan, 
the secret in operating the machine 
lies in setting up the problem cor
rectly. For instance in statistical
work, by using the correct pro
cedure, it is possible to find five 
answers at once  two summation 
columns, two summations of 
squares, and a cross product sum
mation!
Take Heed!
There are three different types 
of machines, Friden, Marchant, 
and Monroe, each of which oper
ates slightly differently and re
quires certain precautions in its 
use. If you divide a number by 
zero on the Friden machine it will 
have a case of electrical hysterics 
and burn" up trying to get the 
answer.
Some of the machines are here 
on loan from the companies which 
produce them, but all are avail
able for student use. Claimed to be 
foolproof, the calculators have 
lived up to expectationsalthough 
somebody did make a remarkable 
discovery recently. On the Friden 
machine, if you divide 3131313131 
by33333333333, it sounds like a 
company of ROTC men marching 
over the Cut!

Mail, Dining Rooms 
Added To Gardens
Staff Quarters, Trunk Lift Lounge
Among Matty New Improvements
Both the dorm girls and the men will find in Morewood a second 
heaven by next September. Gone will be the long treck to the Inn 
and the cramped quarters in 1A and ID. To plan for the best pos
sible facilities for dorm girls. Mr. L. H. Miller traveled all over the
country examining the layout of?----------------------------------------------------
numerous dorms. From Penn a phonograph for listening enjoyState to Purdue he compared fa
cilities and worked with the archi
tects on the Morewood plan to 
synthesize the best qualities of 
all for the Carnegie women.
Enough has been completed to 
get an over-all view of the fin
ished structure. A tour through 
the iorm would probably begin 
with the B tower entrance, for it 
will be the focal point for most 
activities.
One Mail Room
Straight ahead will be the 
package room surrounded by a 
countered partition for mail. Girls 
from all towers will receive their 
mail and packages here. To fa
cilitate easier handling and more 
efficient operation of mail, the re
ceiving room directly underneath 
is being enlarged, and a dumb 
waiter shaft put in for extra 
speed.
For the convenience of waiting 
males is a large lounge, extend
ing from B entrance to C en
trance.
Near the tower B entrance will 
also be the center for signing in 
and out. with someone on duty 24 
hours a day.
Staff Quarters
Turning left into what was 
once the first floor of Tower A. 
there is further evidence of change 
for the better. Six living rooms, 
bedroona-bath combinations have 
been made for the staff. Near by 
i." a room for meetings, to be pro
vided with tables, chairs, and a 
dignified atmosphere for the use 
of dorm council and other organ
izations. Five attractive living 
rooms and alcoves, all differing in 
shape and design will provide 
comfort and privacy for their oc
cupants.
Back in the center of the build
ing is a small room, directly over 
the kitchen with a dumb waiter 
shaft connecting. The room will 
be provided with a tea service so 
teas and social events may be held 
in the lounges.
New Music Kooni
Towards the back will be a li
brary for quiet study, which can 
also serve as a meeting room when 
the schedule is crowded.
Tower C will be an acoustically 
treated music room provided with
ment. Another innovation will be 
extra rooms on the first floors for 
visiting mothers and special 
guests.
On the first floor of C tower the 
new and improved infirmary will 
find a permanent location. Two 
rooms separated by a bath will 
adjoin the infirmary kitchen and 
nurse's quarters.
Downstairs are two dining 
rooms separted by a lobby. For ! 
the convenience of those coming j 
from the outside is a Forbes Street j 
entrance flanked by coat and book | 
racks.
New Atmosphere
The two dining rooms will be 
used according to the size of the , 
crowd, giving a homelike atmos
phere instead of the institutional
ized or Skibo feeling. A cafeteria 
line with desk rooms by each din

The food service layout is such 
that it can be used equally well 
for either cafeteria or table serv
ice. j
In the area not generally seen 
by students other improvements 
are evidence. Back through the 
cafeteria room is the kitchen, a 
health inspector's dream come 
true, with sparkling tile walls
and gleaming stoves and work
tables. For greater convenience 
the various cooking operations
have been broken into sections.
Trunk Lift
Automatic trunk lifts have been 
installed, which pick up and put 
on shelves the heaviest of trunks. 
Cars and trucks can drive right 
to the trunk room entrance and 
unload. This eliminates the prob
lem of large trunks that wont
fit into the utility rooms.
Tagged for future development 
is a play room underneath the 
dining room. Excavation has been 
completed along with provisions 
for rest rooms and snack bar.

Marvin Kolatch, senior in the 
CIT drama department, and Bill 
Heller, recent Carnegie drama 
graduate, have purchased the op
tion on Louis Adelman's play, 
Corner of God."
Kolatch and Heller, founders of 
Arnold Hirsh Productions, plan to 
produce the show on Broadway 
season.
Louis Adelman. author ol the 
play, is a senior in the drama de
partment, where he is a majoring 
in playwrighting. He first wrote 
Corner of God about nnie years 
f Dr. Frederick Dorian will j ago, but it was revised and prot the Bach B Minor Mass. J duced at Carnegie last year. Adelt soloists for the concert j man is the author of Lady, Ride

drama department, and it was
there that they got the idea of
producing it on Broadway.

Plant Trips, Lectures 
Supplement Discussion
Tuesday afternoons offer a con
trast for 35 senior metallurgical 
engineers to the mor academic 
phases of their education.
Modern metallurgical practice 
class meets there to discuss mod
ern aspects and problems of. met
allurgical industries. The approach 
is unique among the engineering 
departments of CIT in that the 
students learn through informal 
talks, discussions, and plant in
spection trips rather than formal 
classes or lectures.
Inspection Trips
Each event has a specific pur
pose for investigating a particular 
phase of metallurgical practice. 
One three-week series of pro
grams included movies on production and fabrication of aluminum, 
a talk by the works metallurgist of 
Alcoas New Kensington plant, 
and finally an inspection trip to 
the Alcoa works.
Other programs that have been 
carxied out this year include dis
cussions of the role of the metal
lurgist in the electrical and auto
motive industries and inspection 
of the model iron foundry of the 
American Brake Shoe company in 
Washington, Pennsylvania.
Grads Participate
Discussions and movies are held 
in the activities room of Carnegie 
Union and usually conclude with 
coffee and doughnuts. For the in
spection trips an engineer guide is 
assigned to each group of three or 
four men. assuring that individual 
questions can be answered com
pletely.
Carnegie graduates have partic
ipated in several of the programs. 
Many hold prominent positions in 
industries around Pittsburgh, and 
they are glad to have an oppor
tunity to talk with future mem
bers of their profession.
Programs for modern metal
lurgical practice are planned and 
supervised by Professors Ludewig 
and Hawkes of the metallurgical 
engineering department.

Reception By Doherty 
His Last At Carnegie
Amid paint brushes, easels, and tartan plaid. President Doherty 
held his last formal reception for the faculty. The exhibition room 
in the Arts building has seen many receptions, but the last, held on 
April 15, was one long to be remembered.
The faculty gave the Dohertys^---------------------------------------gifts both as a token and rememI suc^ an auspicious occasion. Walbrance of their 15 years at CIT. 
President Doherty received a 
complete set of painting equip
ment including paints, brushes, 
canvas, and easels.
To the tune of bagpipers, Mrs. 
Doherty wras given a piece of 
tartan plaid. Austen Wright, head 
of the department of English 
composed* a poem for the occasion. 
The costume and design students 
of Margaret Morrison made 
sketches suggesting uses for the 
material.
ter Blenko, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee, made the pre
sentation of Florida or Bust to 
the permanent collection of the 
Carnegie Museum. With due 
solemnity, Roy A. Hunt, vice 
chairman of the board of trustees, 
refused the gift and gave it in
stead to President-Doherty.
Dr. Doherty graciously received 
the 9 by 15 foot /work of art 
and will take it to Florida with 
him. What to do with it is another 
question. Perhaps Mrs. Doherty 
' will find the caracatures around
The remaining money left over : the frame helpful in her decision
from the gifts will go into a 
scholarship fund in President 
Dohertys name.
Highlighting the evening was 
the grand unveiling of the take
off on Old Jim entitled Flor
ida or Bust. It w'as conducted 
with due formality appropriate for
of what to do with the plaid.
To those who have known the 
President, Dr. Beatties apt in
scription well fits the occasion.

Gittens Receives Award 
Outstanding night school student.* * * * * * 
Gittens, 14 Years A Student, 
Receives Night School Award
Michael J. Gittens, the recipient of the Evening Student Achieve
ment' Award, t ill receive a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical 
engineering on June 14. He is completing 14 years of Evening School 
study at Carnegie Tech.
In 1935 Mr. Gittens came to'
Pittsburgh from Green Bay, Wis
consin, where he* was born. He 
was employed by the Pittsburgh 
Railways Company as a street car 
operator, and since that time has 
been advanced to the position of 
Traffic Engineei-. It is his respon
sibility to work out traffic prob
lems with the officials of the City 
of . Pittsburgh and surrounding 
municipalities. ,
Mr. Gittens is married and re
sides at 7739 Forbes St. He has 
one daughter, Michele. For the 
past year he has been President 
of Evening Student Council and 
Evening Student Vice President
of Eta Kappa Nu. He is also a 
member of Tau Beta Pi, the Am
erican Institute of Electrical En
gineers, the Institute of Traffic 
Engineers, and Sigma Delta Phi.
The Evening Student Achieve
ment Award is presented annually 
to one of the graduating students. 
The purpose of the award is to 
stimulate effort toward outstand
ing scholarship, to promote an 
interest in extra curricular activ
ities, and to induce personal 
achievement. It is intended that 
the possibility of obtaining the 
award will act as an incentive to 
each and every Evening Student 
to participate in the activities of 
Evening Student Council.

Some of the pictures taken by 
the Evening school Engineers at 
their thirty-fifth Annual Banquet, 
sets us to wondering if the fel

close.
This is the time of the year that 
night students become officially 
evening students. The differentia
tion lies in the fact that day light 
beams into class rooms until most 
class sessions are well in progress. 
This fact accounts for the listless 
squirming of the student who is 
only physically present in the 
class room.

Our second congratulations is 
extended to Norman Martello, 
former evening student on the 
birth of a baby girl to the Mar

Apathy
Those who attended the Evening S'chool Engineers Banquet were 
treated to an enlightening speech by a very capable speaker, Robert 
C. Downie, President of Peoples First National Bank and Trust Com
pany. His speech brought home the fact that too many of us just 
let the world go by on its merry way. We are satisfied, just as long 
as our own small egocentric world is not disturbed.
The general lack of interest of the people of the United States 
in their government has led to a condition of financial instability and 
political skull-duggery. Stern measures to avert a catastrophe are 
now necessary. The present condition of the United States would not 
have been brought about if the average citizen had taken a more 
active interest in the condition of the Country.
An analogy may be drawn between the federal government and 
the Evening Student Council.
Student Council, which dates its existence from February 22, 
1925, has made memorable advancement since that day, wThich by 
coincidence, is also the birthday-of the father of our Country. Band
ing together the various individual groups into one united colony, 
Evening Student Council became a closely knit organization. It re
ceived recognition from the administration of the school, and with 
their cooperation instituted many activities for the benefit of the 
Evening Student body.
Before the war, representatives of the Evening Student Council 
were chosen by general election held by the student body. Interest 
lagged, and for the past several years representatives have been 
chosen by vote of the Council itself. This is a definite step toward 
non-representative government, and could lead to exploitation of the 
selfish interests of those in power.
Fortunately, Student Council has had the .foresight to watch for 
evidence of power politics and picked capable men as its officers.
The comparison to be made withMhe federal government is, that 
a general apathy of the students toward the functioning of their gov
erning body might eventually result in its mismanagement.
Mismanagement of Evening Student Council would bring serious 
reprocussions from the school administration in our case. It could 
conceivably mean the end of all that has been so valiantly striven 
for since 1925. i
Let us not misplace Mr. Downies faith in the ambitious future 
of night school students. Keep your eyes and ears open on what is 
going on in the world around you and then you wont be surprised 
by the unusual or unexpected.

Council Views Election Changes; 
Proposal Made To Unify Rules
At the Evening Student Council meeting held May 7, proposals 
were received for changes in the method of electing representatives 
to Council. Announcement for acceptance of nominees as represen
tatives to Council would be posted, together with requirements for 
the office. It is further proposed^-
CAMPUS ZOO
that election of representatives 
shall follow at second semester 
registration. Council deems it its 
duty to see that truely representa
tive government is put back on 
the campus, and leaves the issue 
up to the student body.
Another proposal recommended 
that Councils operating rules and 
regulations be assembled in a con
cise form. The recommendation 
considered the fact that numerous 1 
changes in regulations have ocj 
eurred during the past several j 
years, and a comprehensive study j 
of procedures would enable Coun; 
cil to present a set of By-Laws j 
that would be beneficial in keep; 
ing the present membership and | 
their successors adequately in; 
formed. A motion was passed j 
that an outline of the proposed 
By-Laws be prepared for presenj 
tation at the next meeting.
I A report from the committee j 
chairmen showed that small losses 
i were incurred as a result of dej j creased attendance at the last j 
I dance and the Engineers Banquet. !
| This lends emphasis to the statej 
; ments made by John Miller, social | 
chairman, that more effort must I 
| be put into the sale of tickets.
I Student Council members them
selves must contact all the stu; visor<5 
dents they can and demonstrate! 
their sales ability by getting the ; wornen> 
facts of the event across to the j helping tt 
student.
Student Effort
Gave Success 
To Banquet
The success of the evening 
school engineers banquet was due 
in great measure to the strenuous 
efforts of the two Co-chairman, 
Messrs. Keller and Rowland. It 
was evident that all who attend
ed had an enjoyable time.
The gentlemen had the help of 
many members of the evening 
school body, plus the good wiU 
and drive furnished by Evening 
Student Council. The girls of Phi 
Gamma Pf were sweet enough to 
do most of the stenographic work 
connected with such an endeavoe. 
George Bogovitch handled ticket 
sales and records with his usual 
dispatch and was assisted at th 
door by George Dawes. Tony Bar
barino and Dick Van Halange^ 
last years Banquet Chairma 
were kind enough to act as ad 
visors. Many more men, arul 
were in the foreground 
to make the banquet ft 
success.
