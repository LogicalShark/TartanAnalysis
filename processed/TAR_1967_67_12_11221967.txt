USSR Economic System Faulty Applications Open to S.G. Considers Fee To Aid Activities 
Disinclination to Change
Dr. Abram Bergson, director 
of Harvards Russian Research 
Center, said in his talk at the 
Fairless lecture series, Thurs
day, Nov. 16, the Soviet econ
omic system is faculty because 
bureaucrats and enterprise man
agers have a disinclination to 
change through the acquisition 
and application of new tech
nological knowledge.
The explanation, he said, is 
that the introduction of new 
technology involves certain 
risks and requires a consider
able expenditure of time; sec
ondly, after new technology has 
been introduced, more difficult 
plan targets are set and conse
quently there is less opportunity 
for fulfilling them and receiving 
t bonuses.
Dr. Bergson said that under 
Soviet central planning, major 
changes in technology must be 
undertaken on the initiative or 
at least with the approval of 
superior agencies, where the at
titude towards innovation is no 
doubt more favorable than in 
the enterprise.
But because these agencies 
I constitute a highly complex ad
ministrative structure, an en
terprise manager who might 
otherwise have been inclined to 
propose a change in his tech
nology is often discouraged 
simply by the red tape involved, 
he added.
The Harvard economist noted 
that some 400 research and de
sign institutes in the Soviet 
' Union serve the needs of ma
chinery industries alone. More 
than half a dozen of these, he 
said, may have to be consulted 
about the design of a single pro
duct.
Even when the agencies 
themselves take the initiative 
they may be so slow in com
pleting their task tihat the ar
ticle to be produced becomes ob
solete before it appears, Dr. 
Bergson declared.
One of former Premier Ni
kita Krushchevs complaints, he 
(recalled, concerned the intoler
able slowness with which the 
superior agencies functioned, es
pecially in connection with the 
oxygen-converter method of 
uteel which was then being inProduced.
M wlenl Senate 
Freshmen Elections
Six freshman filed petitions 
for the eight seats open to fresh
man in student senate. Timothy 
Larkins, John Coleman; Bernard 
'ipubb, Ira Smith, and Larry 
Young filed for the four seats 
open to members of men's 
dorms. Carol Scheftic presented 
a petition to represent the wom
ens dorms, and no petitions 
were received for any commut
ers. Womens Dorms and com
muters had two open seats each. 
There will be an election for 
' freshmen men during the first 
wtek in December to determine 
which of the five men will rep
resent mens dorms, Carol is 
automatically a member of sen
ate.
Turning to the origin of new 
technologies, Dr. Bergson claim
ed that the heavy reliance of the 
USSR on technologies developed 
labroad, which was especially 
great during the early five-year 
plans, apparently continues, 
through in a diminished degree. 
He pointed out that although in
ventors in the USSR are com
pensated for useful discoveries, 
the rewards are limited, and 
paid in a lump sum.
Re-emipsasizing that the Sov
iet Union must rely largely on 
institutional research for the de
velopment of new technologies, 
he wondered how effectively 
the potential advantages of ins
titutional research are exploit
ed, and whether in any event 
technological creativity has not 
suffered because of the extreme 
concentration on such research 
at the expense of that of the 
independent inventor.
Dr. Bergsons Thursday talk 
the third assessing the success
es and failures of Soviet eco
nomic planningcloses the 1967 
Benjamin F. Fairless Memorial 
Lecture series.
Peace Corps to Assist 
In Draft Deferments
The Peace Corps announced 
today it will intervene on behalf 
of Volunteers seeking draft de
ferments for two years of over
seas service.
Agency Director Jack Vaughn, 
concerned by mounting induc
tion calls to Volunteers serving 
overseas, said he will take an 
active role in seeking future 
deferment cases the Presidential 
Appeal Board  the court of 
last resort for draft reclassifica
tions.
In the past the agency per
formed a largely informational 
function  advising Volunteers 
and trainees of Selective Service 
laws and procedures and con
firming to local boards the fact 
of the Volunteers service.
In future appeals, Vaughn 
will write letters to the board 
describing the circumstances in 
each case and urging board 
members to grant a deferment 
until completion of the Volun
teers overseas tour.
We have a serious, situation 
he said. The problem of induc
tion notices to overseas Volun
teers is becoming a major con
cern for us. Pulling a Volunteer 
off a productive job at mid-tour 
is unfair to the nation, the hos 
country, the Peace Corps and 
the individual.
The vast majority of Peace 
Corps Volunteers are granted de
ferments for two years of over
seas duty because their service 
is deemed by the local boards 
to be in the national interest, 
as recommended by Lt. Gen. 
Lewis B. Hershey, the -draft di
rector.
However, some local Selective 
Service boards refuse defer
ments even though Peace Corps
Philippine Project
Twenty students-and a num
ber of other interested people 
attended the meeting last Thurs
day when Bernie Dobroski, 
chairman of the Campus Ys 
Philippine Project for Summer 
1968, introduced plans for the 
program. Mr. and Mrs. Jim 
Scheirer, graduate students at 
Pitt who were Peace Corps vol
unteers at Mindanao State Uni
versity, the site of the project, 
showed slides of the school and 
the surrounding area in the 
southern Philippines and told 
of the beginnings of the Univers
ity and its efforts to upgrade 
education in an underdeveloped 
area of the country. A total of
34 students and one faculty 
member have indicated a desire 
to participate in the project.
Applications for the program 
will be open until January 25. 
By then completion of a formal 
application will have been re
quired. Between now and midFebruary applicants are wellcome to work on four t a s kgroups: travel and itenerary, 
budget and finances, orientation 
and training, and program at 
Mindanao. By mid-February par
ticipants and alternates will be 
selected, and orientation will 
take place during March and 
April. The possibility of H&SS 
credit for participation in the 
entire project is being investi
gated.
Major projects to be under
taken at Mindanao will be tu
toring in high school and col
lege math and English, partici
pation in workshops in music 
and fine arts, and working with 
Mindanao students on projects 
such as building construction, 
development of laboratories, and 
various extracurricular activ
ities. Emphasis will be placed 
upon mutual relationships with 
a group of Mindanao counter
parts, and the learnings which 
Carnegie participants will gain 
by knowing and living with the 
Filippino students.
Applications and further in
formation may be secured at 
the Campus Y office, 57 Skibo.
service does not relieve Volun
teers of their draft obligations. 
If the local board is upheld by 
the State Appeal Board, the 
case may reach the Presidential 
Appeal Board which makes the 
final decision.
The appeal process often takes 
months to be resolved and the 
Peace Corps frequently sends 
Volunteers to their overseas 
sites while their appeals for de
ferment are pending.
An activities fee is under con
sideration by Student Govern
ment. Assessed to all under
graduates, this fee would cover 
the cost of Homecoming, Spring 
Carnival and student publica
tions.
According to Thomas McPheeley, Coordinator of Student Ac
tivities, most colleges have such 
a fee. For example, at Penn 
State University a fee $20.00 
per semester is charged to cov
er student activities. Of course, 
it must be realized that their 
tuition is considerably less than 
it is here. At Duquesne Univers
ity, the fee covers the running 
of the student union, with $30,-
000 remaining to cover the cost 
of additional entertainment on 
campus. This means that the 
student government can charge 
a minimal fee for a concert, us
ing the fund to cover all losses.
The present budget for enter
tainment at C-MU is $6,000.00. 
This primarily meets the cost 
of the lecture series which has 
featured such speakers as Dick 
Gregory and Al Capp. A sepa
rate budget is provided for the
A.F.P.F. Sponsors
The AFPF has chosen to help 
sponsor Operation Christmas 
Card a Brigham Young Uni
versity project of sending cards 
to American servicemen in Viet
nam. AFPF has approached Pan 
Hel and CEF for financial back
ing of this non-partisan project.
Although the membership of 
the AFPF is primarily antagon
istic to Americas presence in 
Vietnam, AFPF has accepted 
this project as one of good will 
towards the men whom our 
government has stationed there. 
These men may be fighting an 
unjust war, but they are our 
brothers and they are lonesome 
for home on the holiday. If we 
cant bring them back, lets take 
a little Christmas to them. 
AFPF plans to have as many 
Christmas cards sent from the 
C-MU student body as funds 
will allow. As all cards must 
be printed and returned by Dec.
4, we hope that campus groups 
will give their OJi. for this pro
ject quickly.
The AFPF is also planning a 
Vietnam referendum on C-MU 
campus Dec. 7 and 8.. This ref
erendum will give the student 
body a better chance of express
ing its position than the typical 
university referendum, said 
one AFPF representative. We 
plan to have several alternatives 
outlined in the Dec. 6 Tartan 
rather than the oversimplified 
yes or no vote found on many 
such ballots.
Financial support for this referundum and the proposed for
um series of lectures and movies 
depicting both sides of the Viet
nam debate is presently being 
discussed by Student Govern
ment.
two big weekends. Homecoming 
involves approximately $12,000-
00 and Spring Carnival, about 
$13,000.00. If an activities fee 
were leveled, the cost of a week
end ticket could be reduced to 
a minimal charge of $1.00, this 
being solely for the purpose of 
limiting attendance.
According to Mr. McPheeley, 
$6,000.00 is the minimum with 
which Student Government 
could work. In addition to the 
weekends, this money would al
so finance The Tartan, The 
Technical, Patterns, and The 
Thistle which absorb about 
$3,000.00 of the budget. This 
leaves $4,000.00 to use for extra 
entertainment, which could pro
bably be stretched to $10,000.00 
by charging minimal fees at 
weekend events, his activities 
fee would be paid for by sepa
rate check at registration.
One important advantage of a 
student activties fee is that Gov
ernment would have its own 
treasury which it could use at 
its own discretion. As it stands, 
for every activity, Student Gov
ernment must submit a budget 
which must first has to be ap
proved before the money is al
located. This system makes the 
Senate a fairly impotent body. 
An activties fee would put the 
money directly in the hands of 
the students.
The proposals is still under 
consideration by the Student 
Senate and no action has yet 
been taken. ,

EDITORIAL
An Open Letter to Dr. Schatz
Well, the fellows in the Rubber Rumpus Room over at War
ner Hall have done it again. It seems that one or several of them 
appropiated some of your stationery. We received a proposed aca
demic calendar this week, and we are quite sure that neither you 
or your committee could have devised tihis plan.
Copies of this calendar were also sent to the faculty along 
with a ballot which gave the choice between the proposed calendar 
and the traditional one. We received a note from one faculty mem
ber which read, in part, It seems . . . that . . . students ought to 
be interested in the proposed calendar sprung on the faculty by 
the administration. Its many disadvantages . . . center around the 
acutal loss of vacation time without any meaningful addition to 
effective study time.
That just about sums up our feeling here at the Tartan.
However, bad as the proposed calendar may be, it does bring 
up once again the stibject of calendar revision, a subject which 
has been under consideration for several years now without appar
ent results. We looked at the traditional calendar and the calendar 
distributed to the faculty, and decided that if two ideas were good, 
three ideas were even better. So, you will find a suggested Tartan 
calendar below, along the other two.
The Tartan calendar provides for a 73 day first semester and 
a 76 day second semester. It contains the Homecoming, Thanks
giving, and Spring Carnival weekends which we all look forward 
to, without a loss of vacation time. In fact, our vacations would 
now really be vacations, for we would not have finals or papers 
due at the end of them. As well, the Tartan plan provides for read
ing time or a break between the end of class and the beginning 
of Final Examinations. In addition, our mid-terms would be over 
before Thanksgiving and Spring Vacation.
With tuition on the rise, it woiild provide one more advantage; 
summer vacation would be extended. Hence, we could all better 
afford the cost of a C-MU education. (For example, under our plan, 
summer vacation would last 15 rather than 13 weeks this year.)
We submit this plan for consideration by your committee, the 
faculty, and most of all, the student body. We feel that any pro
posal should be the result of honest effort toward improvement 
of some kind. Our proposal offers the same number of class days 
in a more rational form, this would seem to be desirable to faculty, 
students and administration alike. We hope it will be given equal 
consideration with proposals generated from any other segment of 
the campus community. We welcome criticism and hope that all 
affected parties will make their feelings known to the Tartan and 
to the Academic Affairs Committee.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
AFPF Should Work 
As Campus Group
Editor, The Tartan:
Rather than have AFPF en
gage in off campus campaign
ing, it seems more reasonable 
that they remain on campus to 
help provide political and moral 
awareness for those who will be 
the brain-power behind future 
weaponry, whether it be bet
ter napalm or orbiting nuclear 
devices. These are the people 
who muist be made aware of 
their individual responsibility 
for governmental use of the 
weapons that they helped to 
provide.
The fact that AFPF is not 
trying to cure the worlds prob
lems is not so much partisan
ship as it is a realistic position. 
They recognize that they must 
deal with individual issues such 
as Dow and Vietnam rather 
than attacking major philoso
phical problems with no more 
logic and organization than flam
ing idealism.

Goals of A.F.P.F. 
Explicity Explained
Editor, The Tartan:
In your editorial of last week 
you advise the AFPF to look 
at its goalsits reason for exis
tenceand then its activities. 
Because you seem to be ignor
ant of the basic nature and func
tion of the AFPF (and made no 
attempt to acquire such infor
mation), we feel it is necessary 
to enlighten you on these mat
ters.
Primarily, your editorial ac
cused the group of prostituting 
its ideals of an anti-war cam
paign. Although there are paci
fists in our group, the AFPF is 
not a pacifist organization, and 
does not attack all war as being 
unnecessary. But, pacifist and 
non-pacifist alike, the members 
of our group are disturbed by 
this war in Vietnam. As an antiVietnam group we view our goal 
as making our campus one of 
the better informed about this 
conflict through speakers, liter
ature, and films which will pre
sent both sides of these argu
ments.
You have condemned us for 
not going out among the people 
to spread the gospel. As a cam
pus group, however, we view 
our major goal as one of in
forming the campus communittyand feel that this alone is a 
formidable task. We would rath
er do this job well than ineffec
tually tirade among the worlds 
populace.
As our goal is to inform the 
campus community about the 
Vietnam issues, we feel that 
neither Christs solution of phy
sically destroying the contents 
of the Temple-nor Ghandis solu
tion of sitting down until we 
are draged away  will serve 
our ends. Our choice of an anti
napalm dance rally was an at
tempt to focus campus atten
tion upon the use of a weapon 
which symbolizes the damage 
being to a civilian population in 
Vietnam. Arousal about Viet
nam, either pro or con, is a 
prerequisite for making any 
member of this community seek 
gut additional information about
the nature of American involve
ment there.
We feel that the gap which 
you see between our goals and 
activities is primarily due to 
your misconception of our goals. 
We will agree with you that 
war, pestilence, fever, poverty, 
hunger, etc., are horrid. How
ever, we do not feel that our 
group can effectively attack all 
of these ills this year. Practical
ly, we do not even believe that 
it is worth a try.

Flame of Napalm
Editor, The Tartan:
After reading your editorial 
last week, it became clear to me 
that the flame of napalm is not 
the only flame we have to com
bat.

Novel Proposal 
to End Dollar Drain
Editor, The Tartan:
We would like to express our 
appreciation to Charles Haid 
and Joanne Linneroth for stat
ing their concern for the wel
fare of our student center. We 
completely agree that the 
throngs of engineers, groups 
of Maggie Murphs, crowds of 
Dramats, swarms of P and Ds, 
hippies, gatherings of profes
sors and graduate students 
(even those Mudge people) 
members of the Administration, 
huge womens clubs meetings, 
guest speakers, compueter rats, 
upward bound teenagers, mu
sicians, green men, food service 
personnel  men, women, and 
children should be barred from 
Skibo to prevent misuse of its 
facilities.
This is the only realistic point 
of view that one can take if one 
is truly concerned with the 
schools well-being during these 
trying times of famine, pesti
lence, and war. In this truly 
materialistic world, our spirit
ual haven sticks out like a sore 
thumb. The only sensible course 
of action would be to rent Ski
bo out to the Pitt students and 
thereby lower our tuition.
Two More 
Concerned Students
A.F.P.F. Faces Issues 
Very Practically
Editor, The Tartan:
Your editorial last week ram
bles quite a bit . peace and 
war, but says \ j little that 
makes any sense. To go around 
muttering War is bad, war is 
bad is not very constructive. 
Many things are badhunger, 
disease, and war among them. 
We all know this. Anyone who 
goes ringing doorbells shouting 
Thou shalt not kill would 
probably be put away.
The AFPF is being somewhat 
more practical; I think they 
would grant that war in general 
is not desirable, but little can 
be done about mans basic na
ture, save perhaps from the pul
pit (War is bad, war is bad, 
dont forget to tithe.) AFPF is 
protesting this war, and specifi
cally, the use of of napalm, 
which maims civilians and com
batants alike. If enough people 
protest the use of napalm, then, 
perhaps the administration will 
decide that it looks bad for the 
U.S. to maim and burn civilians, 
and will then stop.
How can you possibly accuse 
them of being insincere, just 
because you dont agree with 
the methods they use. And how 
can you write such drivel as 
We must not be anti-war, or 
anti - prejudice? Particularly 
when you open the editorial by 
citing the fact that war itself 
is bad. You can and should be 
anti-war, and aniti-*prejudice.
Finally, to assume that every
one on the Tech campus is 
against the war in Vietnam is 
simply naive; perhaps you 
should mingle with the natives 
a bit.
Sincerely,
Jeff Begun .

A.F.P.F. Organized 
To Present All Views
Editor, The Tartan:
Last week, a letter signed by 
one James Coyne appeared 
which seriously misrepresented 
the AFPF. I should like to set 
the facts straight: ^
1. AFPF was reorganized late 
in October of 1967 after being 
dormant for two years. It is 
impossible that members of the 
present AFPF could have parti
cipated in the demonstration 
mentioned (which took place in 
the faU of 1966) with AFPF 
sanction.

2. AFPF indeed fully intends 
to represent the viewpoints of 
the entire campus. In fact, Mr. 
Coyne has beening working with 
the AFPF to secure qualified 
conservative speakers for a 
series of formal debates in the 
C-MU fraternity system.
i
3. AFPF is seeking financial 
support through appropriate 
channels; the mentioned meet
ing with Dean Brown to request 
foundation support for future 
forums. It should be noted that 
all of AFPFs activities which 
will be subsidized by Student 
Government will also be ap 
proved by the same body.
The Young Republicans and 
YAF do not serve the campus is 
general and hence have no busi
ness asking for funds from Stu
dent Government.
The AFPF, however, is inter
ested in bringing qualified speak
ers of all political persuasion to 
the C-MU campus, so that stu
dents may judge American For
eign Policy from many view
points.
The AFPF was organized with 
the purpose of filling the in
formation gap which exists on 
this campus regarding the Viet
nam War and other controversi
al acts of American Foreign 
Policy. Given appropriate fund
ing, it will do such a job for 
the enrichment of the campus 
community. !

President Explains 
First Crazy Nite
Editor, The Tartan:
As president of Mortar Board,
I would like to bring to the at
tention of the campus some of 
the details involved in planning 
and presenting our Crazy 
Night of Nov. 10, for the pur
pose of explaining the complica
tions which occurred and to 
give public recognition to those 
who enabled us to sponsor the 
event.
I realize that the first 20 min
utes of Crazy Night appeared 
to be utter confusion. As this 
was an all-campus event, we 
had requested to have the lobby 
of Skibo closed to students by 
11:45 pm so that we could ar
range tables near the entrance 
doors and be ready to handle 
the incoming students; a mis
interpretation of our request oc
curred in the Security Office 
and Skibo was not cleared for 
us. A further complication re
sulted when the tables we re
quested were not set up at the 
time and places requested. As 
this was the first time Mortar 
Board has carried out such a
project, we did not have previ
ous records to work with and 
did not realize how specific our 
requests to such offices as Se
curity had to be.
Many students were disap
pointed when the publicized mo
vie, Lord Jim, was not shown. 
The movie, donated by Mens 
Dorm Council, was not cleared 
for release, but neither MDC 
nor we knew about this until 
the Tuesday night before Crazy 
Night. By this time our publi
city was out and we could only 
hope that the distributor could 
get a release on the film by Fri
day or could send an accept
able substitute.
If Mortar Board presents an
other Crazy Night in the fu
ture we hope that the campus 
will realize that this past event 
was planned and carried out as 
an experiment and that we now 
realize the complications that 
can arise and know what must 
be done to prevent them; i.e., 
we hope that the campus will 
not boycott a Crazy Night in 
the future because of impres
sions made by this first attempt. 
The amount collected in admis
sion fees indicates that over 350 
students attended Crazy 
Night, and we feel that any 
event that can bring out many 
students when it is presented 
as an experiment is worth the 
effort involved to present it 
again.
We would like to express our 
gratitude to Mens Dorm Coun
cil, AO, CFP and Panhellenic 
Council for their assistance and 
support. We wish also to thank 
Dean Swank, Mrs. Milligan, and 
Mr. McFeeley for their encour
agement to attempt something 
new to us and for their guidance 
an planning Crazy Night.

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular 
kinds of guys. Except bigger.
And that can he an advantage.
How? Well, for one thing, youve got more going for 
you. Take Ford Motor Company. A giant in an exciting 
and vital business. Thinking giant thoughts. About market' 
ing Mustang. Cougar. A city car for the future.
Come to work for this giant and youll begin to think 
like one.
Because youre dealing with bigger problems, the 
consequences, of course, will be greater. Your responsibilities 
heavier. That means your experience must be bettermore 
complete. And so, youll get the kind of opportunities only a 
giant can give.
Giants just naturally seem to attract top professionals. 
Men that you'll be working with, and for. Marketing and 
sales pros working hard to accelerate your advancement.
Because theres more to do, youll learn more. In more
areas. You may handle as many as three different assignments 
in your first two years.
You'll develop a talent for making hard'nosed, imaginative decisions. And youll know how these decisions affect 
the guts of the operation. At the grass roots. Because you'll 
have been there.
If you'd like to be a giant yourself, and youve got 
better ideas in marketing and sales, see the man from Ford 
when he visits yoyr campus. Or send your resume to Ford 
Motor Company, College Recruiting Department.
You and Ford can grow bigger together.

Dr. Samuel Son being escorted from Skibo after his lecture.
The static efficiency meas
ure of the USSR, as socialism 
is exemplified in its statement, 
has not the superiority of the 
quasi-isoquant system of the 
Eastern half of the United 
States, said Samuel Son, Di
rector of the Carnegie - Mellon 
University Center for the Re
search of Fuzzy Economic Is',Jsues in his Benjamin Fearless 
Lecture here last Thursday, 
day.
Dr. Son pointed out that 
studies of the use of hostility 
as channeled into active, pro
ductive pursuits such as rape 
shows that the Soviet Union is 
lagging far behind the United 
States and the other capitaistic, 
lecherous societies of Northwest 
Europe in terms of efficiency.
Explaining that static efficien 
cy refers to performance in util
izing technological possibilities 
existing at one time, Dr. Son 
pointed out that there is also 
a dynamic efficiency which has 
to do with a communitys capa
city to add to its technological 
knowledge and improve its ex'ploitation of such knowledge.
Dr. Son called attention to the 
emphasis placed on moral de
generation in the USSR and said 
that an outstanding feature of 
the Soviet socialist system is the 
transfer of responsibility for de
bauchery and other acts of lust 
and passion to a small group 
of political authorities able with
in wide limits to pursue such 
ends as they see fit.
He pointed out that under 
their infamous five year plans, 
the systems directors did man
age in an initially backward 
country to raise the level of lust 
with exceptional rapidity to nota
bly high levels rarely matched 
in the West But, he pointed out, 
so far as growth is generated 
apart from efficiency, the in
evitable corollary is esthetic 
denial to the consumer.
If the consumers are now to 
share more fully in the fruits of 
the growth of debauchery, 
grovyth is no longer achievable 
to the degree that it was under 
Stalin merely through exaction
of love at the expense of exper
tise. To a greater extent than 
in the past, growth must be 
achieved through efficiency.
Continuing h i s examination 
of efficiency, Dr. Son expressed 
his belief that static efficiency 
in the USSR is comparable to 
that under capitalism where the 
Marxist claim as to the love ca
pacity of socialism finds no jur
isdiction.
Quantative Data
Focusing his discussion on 
what he termed, quantitative 
data, dealing with comparative 
measures of national output 
per worker in this area, Dr. Son 
presented statistics proving that 
the Soviet Union stands on a 
par only with Fon du Lac, Wis
consin, and falls below all other 
capitalistic societies. Soviet out
put per man is but 22 to 38 
per cent of the average red 
blooded American boy.
He pointed out that some rea
sons for the lack of static effi
ciency are the makeup (about 
50 per cent winos) of the work
ing force, as well as its lack of 
adequate burlesque houses, and 
said that adjusting for all of 
these factors still leaves the So
viet Union behind all capitalis
tic units except Fon du Lac.
Admitting that the USSR has 
been a latecomer in organized 
crime, Dr. Son pointed out that 
it initiated its first five .year 
plan in 1928 and thus has had 
almost decades to raise its stock 
of expertise to the level of the 
capitalistic West. If theyre not 
messing around as much as we 
are, it must be agreed, I think 
that the preponderant cause 
must be, not the late start, but 
inefficiency.
Dr. Son added that in addition 
to gauging the USSRs use of 
available supplies and resources, 
one should also take a look at 
the struc ture, that is, the kind 
of women the Russian men have 
to work with. At least in re
spect of quality and assortment, 
the Soviet selection of women 
must diverge from any which
Student Congress
The meeting was called to or
der at 16:07:06 sidereal time by 
acting vice - president Shirley 
Temple Black. (Well, somebody 
had to take her.) The necessary 
plurality of a majority of a quo^ 
rum was not present, but the 
meeting was held anyway.
Committee Reports
1. Food service: Students are 
reminded that a state law pro
hibits pets and petting in the 
Snack Bar. In response to com
plaints of forks breaking in ^ 
french fries, the Food Service 
has promised to provide soggier 
french fries.
2. Rules: (1) It was decided 
that the Bookstore will purchase 
paper railed 1/ between lines 
rather than 3/8 between lines. 
(2) The dogs in Skibo will be ^ 
represented in Student Congress 
due to their increasing influence 
and number. (3) It was suggest
ed that the chairmen of all Ex
ternal Committees (hence ex
cluding Internal Committees un
less specifically named) in ac
cordance with regulations con$cerning the provisions of inter
nal committees non-externality 
shall provide for it.
3. Finance: The following ap
propriation was passed. $15.36 to 
Tony Lawrence to attendthe 
first national convention of 
Amalgamated Frozen Food 
Packers and Film Critics Asso^
ciation been held in Seacaucus,
N. J.
4. Publicity: It was moved and 
seconded that a 46 foot diameter 
weather balloon bearing the in
scriptions I like Guy and 
Lets Go Carnegie Tech be 
hositered prior to the next board 
of trustees meeting. The balloon ^ 
will be tended by Red Barron,
a member of the C-MU Flying 
Club and will be filled with hot 
air from appropriate Vents near 
Warner Hall.
Old Business: none
New Business and Remarks:
1. Dale Peschel announces that 
he and two other students will ' 
represent C-MU at Student Gov
ernment Congress in San Fran
cisco over Thanksgiving. They 
will fly by way of London and 
Paris. (Happy Thanksgiving.) 2. 
The minutes of Feb. 30, 1966 
should be corrected as follows:
1) lines 1 and 3 should have 
semi-colons instead of periods; ^
2) and under Old Business (same 
date) Nuns should be correct
ed to the proper spelling.
might be optimal. We also have 
slow women, and quite a few 
dogs, so our selection has its 
limitations, but it could hardly 
be as bad as Red Square on a ^ 
Saturday night.
The C-MU economist conclud
ed that only part of the evidence 
on static efficiency had been 
considered, and pointed out that 
his next talk, if it were not cen
sored, would point out some of 
the sources of inefficiency in 
the USSR.
I
As he left the platform Dr. 
Samuel Son was heard to mut
ter, I dont know what an econ
omist is doing analyzing mess
ing around, but it sure is fun.

I won't 
go into business when 
I graduate because:
? a. I'd lose my individuality.? b. Its graduate school for me.? c. My mother wants me to be a doctor.
Cant argue with c), but before you check a) or b)pencils up! There have been some changes. Drastic changes in the business scene. But changes in the vox poputi attitude regarding business . . . especially on campus . . . just haven't kept pace.Take the belabored point that business turns you into a jellyfish. The men who run most of the nations successful firms didnt arrive by nepotism, by trusting an Ouija board, or by agreeing with their bosses. Along the way. a well-modulated No was said. And backed up with the savvy and guts todays business demands.In short, individuality is highly prized in much of the business worldthe successful much. Even when the business is big. Like 
Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System.
We provide communications equipment for
our Bell System teammates, the Bell telephone companies. This takes a lot of thought, decisions, strong stands for our convictions, (and 
sometimes some mistakes . .. were human, every 160,000 of us).Individuality pays off. Not only in raises, but in personal reward as well. Like an engineer who knew deep down that there was a better way to make a certain wire connector and did. Or a WE gal who streamlined timeconsuming office procedures, and saved us some $63,000 a year.Rewards and accolades. For saying No. For thinking creatively and individually. For doing.Not every hour is Fun Hour, but if youve got imagination and individualityyouve got it made. With a business like Western Electric. Well even help you answer b) with our Tuition Refund program. Come on in and go for President!

Knit Madness 
Strikes Closet
The college girls wardrobe 
has caught knitzophrenia! Her 
closet is crammed with knit 
dresses, knit shirts, knit shirts 
(the real buttondown type!), 
knit coats, and most plentiful of 
all, knit sweaters.
And these knits are the knackiest ever, according to Edith 
Raymond Locke, Executive Edi
tor: Fashion and Beauty, of 
Mademoiselle magazine. Theyre 
fur blend, Shetland, or jersey, 
fitting snugly with high, skinny 
armholes. Theyre belted low, or 
not at all. The status outfit for 
the 67 coed: a Shetland skinnysweater pulled over a matching 
A-line ribbed knit skirt. Another 
standout: the fur-blend knit
dress with stand-up neckline 
and big-zip front. But the clas
sic campus favorite remains the 
simple A-line dresseither printstriped or solid.
Collegiate fashion trendsetters 
will bring their kilts back to 
campus this winter. Theyll take 
their old ones out of the moth
balls and shorten them to midthigh, and theyll buy new ones, 
mini-length of course, in solids 
and plaids worn with opague 
tights in new darkling colors.

DANGER! ALFALFA WEEVILS!
An insect alert has been sounded for area growers. Start 
watchnig alfalfa fields now for signs of the alfalfa weevil.
This pesit now ranges over 40 states and is spreading fast. Un
less steps are taken to control it, the weevil will severely damage 
many alfalfa fields this spring.
Damage to alfalfa begins shortly after growth starts in the 
spring and is caused by the larval (or worm) stage of the weevil. 
After feeding for three or four weeks, each larva spins a net-like 
cocoon on the plants or in soil debri sand later emerges ais the 
adult weevil. AD three stages are shown above. '
Feeding begins in the growing tips and developing buds of 
the alfalfa. A heavy infestation will shred the foliage, making the 
first crop a total loss. After the first cutting, larvae and newly 
emerged adults feed on both stubble and new growth, greatly re
ducing yields from the second cutting.
Extension specialists agree that alfalfa is such a valuable for
age crop that its more economical to fight the weevil with insec
ticides than to switch to another crop. A $35 a ton, a yield of three 
tons of alfalfa hay per acre has a value of $105. Even if it takes 
three sprays, the weevil can be stopped for less than $10.
Skirts: Whether theyre mini 
or maxi, this years skirts have 
detailing. Look for kilts with 
buckles and maxi safety pins, 
culottes with a pleat to let them 
masquerade as skirts, a dirndl 
(gathered skirt with a waist
band) with a rolled hem.
Sweaters: Lambswool and fur 
b.end shirt ^sweaters have but
ton-down collars and cuffs. The 
mini-sweater stops just at the 
waist; the maxi grows to 27 
inches and is belted just below 
the waist. Other details to watch 
for: buttons on shoulders and 
sleeves, pockets by the handful 
(for extra color, tuck in a hand
kerchief and giant zippers.
Shirts: The British influence 
comes on strong with muted 
stripes across pale oxford. Ex
ample: deep-blue and yellow
lines tracking a pale-blue oxford 
or green-edged yellow on pale 
peach. Shirts have plenty of 
trimming: a cut-out cuff to show
a big watch, epaulets across the 
shoulders, plenty of pockets 
(again, think handkerchief!). 
For an extra dash of British 
appeal, tuck a foulard scarf in 
at the neckline..
Dresses: As Britain influences 
the college girls shirts, so does 
France her dresses. Watch for 
French detailing like contrast
ing collars and cuffs, low tor
toise-trimmed belts. And shirtdresses pick up details that are 
important on sweaters and 
skirts: multi-pockets, big zip
pers and culottes.
Accessories: Hardware shines 
everywhereon coats, shoes, 
baits, handbags, around wrists. 
Look for buckles, suitcase and 
galosh closings, dog-leash clips, 
grommets and zippers on abso
lutely everything.
These are the details that add 
up to collegiate fashion for Fall 
67!

The keys to effective alfalfa weevile control are selecting the 
most effective insecticide and accurately timing the application. 
Start now to inspect alfalfa twice a week for signs of feeding. 
Check different parts of the field. When three to five out of ten 
plants show damage in the bud tips, spray immediately with a 
recommended insecticide. If an infestation hits at first cutting, 
spray stubble immediately after harvest.
Several materials are available that will effectively control 
the weevil without causing harmful residues in milk of meat. Of 
these, one has been especially formulated for use on alfalfa. It is 
a combination of Diazinon and methoxychoir called Alfa-tox.
Growers have found that under most conditions, a spray of 
Alfa-tox will give two-three weeks control of the weevil, and just 
about every other insect that threatens alfalfa. However, if it rains 
after spraying, alfalfa fields should be checked again, since washoff can reduce the effectiveness of any insecticide.
Entomologists agree that the battle against alfalfa weevil can 
be. won By following a careful management program and spraying 
with a recommended insecticide as soon as 30 to 50 per cent of the 
bud tips show signs of feeding, the weevil can be stopped.
...it s working out just fine.
Dick Klophaus gets real 
satisfaction from the variety 
and sophistication of 
engineering needed to 
develop, design, and manage 
the processes required to 
produce Merck products.
He and his Ch.E. col
leagues get equal satisfaction 
from the knowledge that 
the end result of their work is 
a better life for more people, 
around the world.
For many engineers, its 
an ideal combination. Add 
mobility . . . real opportunity 
for growth and promotion 
. .. real opportunity to learn 
and develop new techniques 
... Mercks liberal policies 
on benefits, graduate work,
and professional achieve
ment ... Mercks outstand
ing sales growth (122% 
since 1957) and research 
investment ($46 million 
this year).
Add all these factors 
together, and youll see why 
Merck attracts some of 
the finest engineering talents 
in the country. And keeps 
them.
How about you? Think 
about the engineering variety 
and sophistication required 
to produce the complex 
molecules used for pharma
ceutical products. Think 
about the good use these 
products are put to.
Then see your Merck 
Representative on campus.
Dick Klophaus, by the way, 
now supervises production 
of Vitamin C, Vitamin Ku 
and various sulfa products.
His responsibilities, and 
those of other young Ch.E.s, 
are described in our new 
booklet, Merck: an engineer's

learn from this booklet 
youll actually enjoy reading 
it. Pick up a copy at your
