Carnegie Mlions Student Newspaper since 1906THE TARTAN
To all of our readers and the entire campus community:
I want to apologize for the racist 
comic we publitffted on April 1 in 
our satirical issue, The Natrat. 
Printing the comic was a breach of 
journalistic ethicsand an act of 
irresponsibility on my part that 
offended many readers and mem
bers of our own staff. I should have 
made sure that I reviewed the 
entire content of the paper before 
publication. I do not blame those 
who were offended by the comic, 
and I cannot deny my mistake. I 
have committed a grave error, one 
that threatens The Tartans mis
sion, its members, and its very 
existence.
Those under me are good, hard
working people and I feel obligat
ed to take responsibility. In my 
academic career and in my time at 
The Tartan, Ive always tried my 
very best. But no matter how hard 
you try, failure is inevitable if you 
dont have what you need to do 
your job. In this case, it was time, 
but I could have prevented this 
dilemma had I the foresight. In 
examining The Tartans problems, 
I have also included myself in my 
examination of The Tartans prob
lems.
I should have realized immedi
ately that our readers would see 
things that way when I was 
approached about pulling copies 
of the paper from campus. 
Recalling an issue of the newspa
per from campus is one of the most 
difficult decisions Ive ever made. I 
thought long and hard about what 
actions I shouldve taken. It is now 
apparent that my indecision was a 
failure.
After all of this, I dont want to 
resign. If I am allowed to continue 
as Editor-in-Chief, and this is in no 
way certain, I have a plan to begin 
the process of earning your trust 
back. One of the ways I intend to 
do this is to establish a content 
review board, composed of wellrespected members of the admin
istration, faculty, and staff. I previ
ously mentioned the names of sev
eral respected members of the 
campus community. After more 
thought, it will take some time to 
determine the final form and composition of the board. It would not 
be fair t mention names when I 
dont know who will join and who 
will not. As part of my effort to 
reform the newspaper, I have sus
pended normal publication. I will 
use the following weeks to work 
with th' administration to estab
lish and~enact ttiis board. This 
panel will be aSked to examine 
material published in The Tartan 
on a regular basis, providing feed
back on accuracy, relevance, and 
impact orr the diverse elements of 
the community.
Another step I wish to take is to 
hold a regularly occurring series of 
forums on free speech and diversi
ty issues, focused on collecting 
feedback from students. This will 
bring the newspaper closer to our 
reading public and allow us to do 
our jobs more effectively. 
Modifying The Tartans constitu
tion to require these forums will 
make sure that this will be the case 
even after I am gone, whether that 
comes next week or next year. 
Also, I intend to lobby for an 
another amendment to The 
Tartans constitution, creating the 
position of an ombudsman, whose 
duty will be overseeing the general 
operating practices of the newspa
per and holding its personnel to 
the highest ethical standards. He 
or she will serve as a representa
tive of the people, ensuring that 
the newspaper stays in close con
tact with its readers.
. In light of recent events, I dont 
see a problem in accomplishing 
this. I hope these proposed actions 
are the beginning of a new era for 
The Tartan, one that sees the con
tinuation of our organization as 
Carnegie Mellons original student 
news source. Forgiveness cannot 
be taken or proclaimed; it must be 
earned and given. I hope my 
efforts are accepted in the spirit 
that they are given, one of sinceri
ty and hope for the future.

A message of apology from Editorial Board members
1 he photos on these pages are from the rally held on Saturday. University or Pittsburgh fraternity Kappa Alpha 
Psi organized the rally for community members to express their views on The Tartan, its actions, and its staff.
The editorial board apologizes 
for the pain and anger caused by 
the comic printed in The Natrat 
on April 1. We feel ashamed on 
behalf of our organization and on 
behalf of the editors who allowed 
the comic to run, and deeply 
regret that The Tartan gas failed 
to uphold its place in the comr&unity. - ~
The Natrats publication proce
dures are not as strictly con
trolled as a normal issues would 
be. That is because it is not a reg
ular paper; it is something we 
produce every year on April 
Fools Day on a volunteer-only 
basis. Many of the peopk usually 
associated with the production of 
the paper, even those with vital 
positions on other weeks, Were 
not even there that night.
As a result, we found ourselves 
understaffed and less than pre
pared to follow the normal 
checks-and-balances system that 
usually ensures quality. Five peo
ple usually inspect each page of 
the paper; that night, only one 
editor saw the comic before it was 
printed. This editor exercised 
very poor judgment in allowing 
the comic to go to print. This
breach of the publics trust was 
unacceptable. The Editor-inChief should have verified this 
page but did not have time.
The fact that a member of The 
Tartans staff would write such a 
thing and expect it to be pub
lished is not acceptable and the 
artisthas beei^fired. The fact that 
the comic made it through our 
process is -unacceptable, and 
steps are being taken to strength
en our editing system,'both inter
nally and externally, with the 
help of University administration. 
To make tinj to do^this, we will 
be suspending.regulafroperations 
for the rest of the semester. 
Suspending regular publication 
will allow us to effeGyhe changes 
necessary to start th^process of 
earning backyour trust.

Additional explanation of the comic strip from its artist:
Editors Note: A detailed analysis by the 
artist of the comics intent is available online 
at bobrost.com/comics/pearlanalysis/. 
Neither the content in this letter nor the con
tent at that website are the official opinion 
of The Tartan.
Recently, The Natrat, the April Fools 
edition of The Tartan, published a comic I 
drew that many people found horribly 
offensive, to the point that various people 
have accused me of being a racist and 
demanded that I be expelled from the uni
versity. Additionally, prompted by this and 
other recent events, a rally was held to 
bring awareness to racism on our campus.
I would first like to apologize to all 
those who were offended so much by my 
comic. I created a series of six comic 
strips, each with their own offensive 
theme. Unfortunately, one in particular 
was found by many to be way over the top. 
I did not intend to harm anyone, and I
apologize for causing such a feeling of 
racism. I am not a racist, I do not approve 
of those who are, and I attended the rally 
in full support of its purpose.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
defend myself. I feel that the content and 
context of my artwork were grossly misin
terpreted by many. In all accounts and 
opinions I have read of the situation, only 
the last two panels of the strip have been 
quoted, which indeed puts a racist spin on 
it, since, without the first panel to set the 
tone, they are taken out of context. An 
article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, for 
example, states that the goat uses a racial 
slur to brag to a mouse that he had hit a 
black person on a bike; however, viewing 
the strip as a whole, the first frame clearly 
sets the tone that it was not intentional on 
the part of the goat. Only the rat makes a 
racist statement and assumes it was not an 
accident. The intended humor of the strip 
comes from the misunderstanding
between the two characters. This humor, 
sadly, did not come through as intended.
My personal context is also important 
in fully understanding the intent of the 
comic. First of all, I have a history of cre
ating offensive comics; I have drawn 
Harold and the Other Guy each week in 
the Tartan comics section for several years 
now. The content of this comic is often 
offensive to some, and I regularly advise 
my mother not to read it. Secondly, when 
I created The Natrat comic in question, I 
realized that it might be too strongly 
offensive, so I created an alternate comic 
that I felt was less so, and I provided the 
editor on staff with an option. 
Unfortunately, we chose to use the first 
comic.
The most important context that has 
not been mentioned in any accounts of the 
issue is that the comic was a parody. Each 
week, The Tartans comics section con
tains a nationally syndicated comic enti
tled Pearls Before Swine, which often 
contains edgy content. My comic, Pearl 
Necklace, used a similar name, an identi
cal art style, and the same characters, the 
difference being that the content does not 
have the same restraint as the original. 
When creating the comic, I had felt that 
the similarities  coupled with being in 
The Natrat, as opposed to a usual paper  
were enough to signify to people that they 
should not take the comic seriously. Sadly, 
many people chose instead to take it seri
ously and found great offense in it.
I am sorry that my actions have caused 
such problems for the campus communi
ty, and I am especially sorry that I hurt so 
many people with my art.

Dear Readers:
For the past six months, I have 
worked for The Tartan as its 
sports editor and news editor. 
Needless to say, I have enjoyed 
my experience thus far.
While the events of the past 
few days have been very unfortu
nate to many members both 
inside and outside of the 
Carnegie Mellon community, 
they have also reflected very 
poorly on the individuals who 
contribute to The Tartan.
Though all members of the 
Editorial Staff are partially 
responsible for what happened in 
the April Fools Day edition of our 
newspaper  including myself 
I would like to state that I did not 
contribute to the editing or layout 
of this issue. There are other 
members of the staff who are as 
innocent as I am, and I encour
aged them to share their perspec
tives as well.
Extremely disappointed by the 
recent events, I have decided to 
take a leave of absence from The 
Tartan. Our newspaper has 
always been accepted as the lead
ing source of news on this cam
pus; I hope to return to a com
pletely new, revamped Tartan in 
the fall, which, I am confident, 
will only improve with my assis
tance.
I look forward to providing 
news to Carnegie Mellon 
University, both as a writer and 
editor, and will earnestly strive to 
prevent anything of this nature 
from ever happening again.

Former News Editor
To the campus community:
I feel the need to make events 
of Wednesday, March 31,2004, in 
their personal relation to me, 
clear. On Friday night I received 
phone calls detailing to me what 
was on the local news. I feel it is 
necessary to say that until the 
comic in question, and in fact, 
much of the paper, was in print, 
that I was unaware of it.
Though initially full of anger, 
as many were, I have decided that 
my best choice at this point is to 
help to make this paper what it 
should be  which should be 
utterly the opposite of some of 
the content in The Natrat, espe
cially what appeared in Pearl 
Necklace.
I may not return to The Tartan 
next semester as an editor; I may 
not return in any capacity, but I 
will still attempt to help this situ
ation get better. I will leave if I 
feel that things stagnate, if prob
lems are not solved in the manner 
I believe they need to be.

Pillbox Editor
Readers:
As a member of a religious 
minority, and as someone who 
believes in tolerance, I was highly 
offended when I saw a racial slur 
printed in The Natrat. I was glad 
to hear about the editors decision 
to fire the person who created 
this comic.
Still, while the editors are ulti
mately responsible for the materi
al printed, I do not believe that 
they intended any malice in let
ting this comic slip through the 
editing process.
I know the editors personally, 
and I have never heard any hate
ful rhetoric from them, and I 
believe that their apologies were 
sincere. I hope to see action taken 
to prevent such incidents from 
happening in the future, but as an 
advocate of free speech, I am wor
ried about the implications of this 
event. I am especially worried 
that people will push The Tartan 
away from political arenas, and 
from responsible dialogue that 
happens to generate disagree
ment. I have enjoyed writing 
political editorials (from the left), 
and hope that Ill be able to con
tinue to do so in the future.

Letters to the Editor
Natrat
- ... 'L--
The past few days have been 
some of the most nerve-wracking 
and strenuous of any that we 
have experienced here at The 
Tartan. I have worked at this 
newspaper for almost two years 
now on its photo staff, and for the 
past semester I have served as 
both photo editor and as a mem
ber of the senior Editorial Board.
I am utterly taken aback by the 
publication of offensive material 
in The Natrat. While I helped in 
its publication, I was not present 
when the comics section was 
pasted into its page and sent to 
the publisher. I do feel, however, 
that an important distinction 
needs to be made when address
ing this issue that has so incensed 
certain valuable members of our 
campus community, several of 
whom I saw at the rally this 
Saturday morning and consider 
good friends.
I do apologize for what we pub
lished in our April 1 edition. 
However, it is important for me to 
stress that the mistake made on 
Thursday morning as The Natrat 
was sent to the publisher was an 
editorial error. It was certainly 
not an error of personal judgment 
or racial prejudice on behalf of 
any of the editors here at The 
Tartan.
I am proud to work at this 
paper. I am proud to work with 
the people I see in this office, all 
of whom are constructive mem
bers of this community. In pub
lishing this paper every week, we 
seek to better Carnegie Mellon as 
a whole. Please know that our 
intents are always the best, and 
that we empathize with those 
who have been offended. Thank 
you for giving me, on a personal 
level, this chance to pursue what I 
love to do.

A letter to the cartoonist 
of Pearls Before Swine
Mr. Stephan Pastis,
On April 1, The Tartan pub
lished a parody of your comic 
strip Pearls Before Swine using 
the images of the characters. 
Although all of the strips were 
intentionally in poor taste, one of 
the comic strips, approved for 
printing by a member of our edi
torial staff, was racist.
We are in the process of apolo
gizing to the campus community 
and have decided to suspend pub
lication for the remainder of the 
semester. I recognize this as a 
serious violation of the trust you 
place in everyone who reads your 
strip.
I personally have a lot of 
respect for your work as a comic 
artist and hope that you will for
give this grievous mistake.

About The Natrat 
Your letter included nothing 
worthwhile. Minority groups 
were offended, yes, but the 
entire thing past page 3 was 
offensive, wildly offensive in a 
non-humorous way, to other 
comunities (such as the GLBT 
community). The ads with muppets saying I eat cock are not 
funny at all  they are a blatant 
offense and completely homophobic and immature. The page 
with the vaginas  I mean, 
come on! CMU is in the middle 
of admissions! This is not 
acceptable!
From a campus community 
member to another, I find this 
the single most utterly repre
hensible thing I have ever seen 
in my college career here at 
CMU. I will never, ever, work 
with The Tartan again, and will 
actively campaign against them 
until a formal apology is put out 
by the senior Tartan staff and 
those responsible have been 
identified.
With The Tartans current 
track record, the fact that someour staff
To the editor:
I must confess I was surprised 
by the recent controversy over 
the publication of racially offen
sive material in The Natrat, and 
not because I hadnt expected 
such filth from the Natrat staff. I 
was surprised because the out
rage of our community leaders 
was focused at one tiny comic in 
the publication, and nothing else.
No one seemed to care about 
the blatant, disgusting, and over
whelming sexual themes that 
were present, such as the huge 
ads involving Muppets Eating 
Cock or the page-size overlay of 
the female genitalia. Not one
Alexander Meseguer,
As I read your apology 
explaining how The Tartan 
newspaper published its annual 
April 1 newspaper bearing the 
Tartan name spelled backwards. 
Im having difficulty understand
ing the doublespeak in your sec
ond paragraph, as you separate 
The Tartan and The Natrat.
In my opinion, you seem to try 
to explain away, how this trash 
sheet came to be, in your phrase 
not subject to our usual proce
dures in classic Clinton-like 
fashion reminiscent of his defini
tion of the word is. If either 
newspaper, The Tartan or The 
Natrat, is an indicator of the cal
iber of the values, character, and
thing like this would be pub
lished is extremely unnerving. 
This was worse than anything 
readme has ever put out. Your 
name (Alex) was even put in 
The Natrat (albeit indirectly).
If you have never seen this 
issue, then you should never 
have published it. As head of a 
campus organization, you and 
your senior staff have a respon
sibility to represent the campus 
community. Being the campus 
newspaper, you have an even 
greater responsibility. This was 
a complete misuse of school 
funds, and a completely unac
ceptable publication.

word was mentioned in concern 
over such essentially porno-^ 
graphic material; instead, the full 
wrath of our politically correct 
community was focused on one 
racially insensitive cartoon. So 
the question is, how can these 
people draw such a crooked line? 
How can they completely ignore 
a giant picture of a vagina, and 
yet be so outraged over one 
comic? If that comic strip had not 
been included, would a single 
word of protest been spoken? I 
think not.
I think that the double stan
dards that exist in our communi
ty speak for themselves. Clearly,
integrity representative in the 
CMU student body, I would sug
gest you come clean and change 
the title of your newspaper 
(including your All Fools Day 
issue) to The Tart. This would 
alert everyone of your loose 
morals right from the top.
As a parent of three potential 
Carnegie Mellon University stu
dents, I believe all aspects bear
ing the Carnegie Mellon 
University name are representa
tive of the University. The content 
of your newspaper, The Tartan, to 
me mocks Andrew Carnegies 
Scottish heritage and disgraces 
his name. He was about giving 
something of value back to socie
ty. Where is that tradition in your

it is permissible to print any sort 
of disgusting material, as long as 
it does not cross nacial,bounds. 
Indeed, we welcome with open 
arms anything which might 
offend the religious community, 
or the sensibilities of our parents, 
but we are horrified that some
one might utter a racial epithet. 
Can you people not see that such 
disregard for traditional moral 
standards is exactly what induces 
this horrifying racism?
