Jeopardy! tapes College Championship
by Isabel Gardocki
Junior Staffwriter
Im just going to do my best, 
declared junior ECE major K. 
Elliott Fleming before being 
pulled away by a Jeopardy! stage 
manager and surrounded by 
cameramen and photographers.
Wearing a gray Carnegie 
Mellon sweatshirt with rolledup sleeves, Fleming answered a 
barrage of questions in a softspoken and confident voice, 
emphasizing that while slightly 
nervous he was still definitely 
pumped about [appearing on 
the show]. Competing along
side him at the Petersen Events 
Center this Saturday were 14 
other students from various 
colleges. Each contestant elimi
nated in the first week received 
$5000, semi-finalists were 
awarded $10,000, and the win
ner was to receive a specially 
designed trophy and a total cash 
prize of $100,000.
Fleming, a member of CMUs 
College Bowl team, considers 
himself fairly literate, espe
cially in the Southern classics, 
but sees his major in ECE as a 
distinct disadvantage because 
of the time he devotes to con
crete activities pertinent to his 
studies. Yet Jeopardy! is a game 
of finesse rather than speed, 
explained Fleming, pointing 
out that fast buzzer skills are 
an asset. According to the rulebook, players who ring in too
early are penalized with a 250- 
millisecond delay.
Before taping began, stu
dents were shown how to use 
the buzzers, sat for make-up 
applications, signed contracts, 
filmed on-air promotions, and 
donned microphones for a 
rehearsal game run by Jimmy 
McGuire, a Clue Crew mem
ber. Rehearsal questions were 
intentionally easy, to account 
for the distractions caused by 
the crew team vacuuming the 
floor, the light tests, the two 
jib arm cameras swinging back 
and forth, and the news per
sonnel snapping pictures only a 
few feet away. Occasionally, the 
famous Jeopardy! theme song 
would blast through the studio, 
a space enclosed by thick blue 
curtains and capable of seating 
3000 people.
The audience was selected 
from a pool of 30,000 people, 
some of whom applied through 
special promotions and others, 
labeled Jeopardy! fanatics 
by announcer Johnny Gilbert, 
who began lining up at 5 am. 
Typically, about 15 million view
ers watch each episode from 
home. We tape five shows a 
day and approximately six days 
a month, added Gilbert, justify
ing the four wardrobe changes 
host Alex Trebek has to make 
during hiseleven-hour working 
day. Taping occurs only twice a 
week.

Deep Rooted controversy in Pittsburgh
by Ann Wootton
Junior Staffwriter
Over the past few weeks, poten
tial controversy has been brewing 
down at the University of Pitts
burgh concerning the schools 
reportedly discriminatory policy 
against bringing in outdoor hiphop concerts. The questions arose 
surrounding a failed proposal to 
bring in The Roots, a popular hiphop group, for the Universitys 
annual Fall Fest outdoor concert. 
The schools justifications for th 
is decision made Roots support
ers question whether the decision 
was discriminatory against hiphop as a whole.
The show was to be in connec
tion with The Pennsylvania Hip4
Hop Political Convention, which 
was held at the University of Pitts
burgh during the first weekend 
in October. Since The Roots are 
largely in support of voter mobi
lization efforts, the show was also 
going to be a culminating event in 
the movement to register young 
voters before the October 4 regis
tration deadline.
An anonymous student involved 
with the Pitt Programming Coun
cil (PPC), the organization plan
ning the Fall Fest concert, said 
that Thomas Misuraca, an advisor 
to the PPC, had been advised by 
experts in the field against hav
ing outdoor hip-hop concerts due 
to risk management and safety 
issues.
Advocates for the Roots concert 
asked to speak to these advisors
in order to address and potential
ly ease these safety concerns, but 
as of yet they have not gained ac
cess to the private list of advisors 
involved in the decision.
The anonymous student noted 
that Misuraca said, I have noth
ing against hip-hop at all. I am 
not anti-hip-hop. It was just what 
I was told. Misuraca could not 
be reached to verify these state
ments.
In describing his conversations 
with university officials, Khari 
Mosley, a head organizer of the 
Pennsylvania Hip-Hop Political 
Convention, said he was told that 
extra logistical things go into hip 
hop concerts as opposed to other 
genres and that extra security

While the Presidential candi
dates prepare for the November 
election with a series of debates, 
last weekend six Carnegie 
Mellon students tried their hands 
in the political sphere by par
ticipating in mock Democratic 
and Republican conventions 
and a simulated debate at Case 
Western Reserve University in 
Cleveland.
Case Western built the pro
gram around the real VicePresidential debate, which 
was held at that university 
last Tuesday. Fifteen colleges 
attended the event, including 
Carnegie Mellon, Case Western, 
Cornell, Johns Hopkins, 
Stanford, and Ohio State. Each 
school sent a delegation of stu
dents and represented a state in 
the convention.

consisted of H&SS sophomore 
Maureen Burns, sophomore CS 
major Joe Arasin, junior chemi
cal engineering major Nicholas 
Scocozzo, sophomore music 
major Jean Lester, and fifth-year 
senior Mark Egerman.
Invitations to attend the event
were sent to student government 
leaders, Student Senators, and 
fifth-year scholars. Interested 
students had to write an applica
tion essay explaining their rea
sons for wanting to attend.
Ive never had a lot of expe
rience with American politics. 
I thought this would be good 
exposure, said Burns.

there wasnt as

On October 2 and 3 delegates 
selected their preferred politi

partys subcommittees: national 
security, domestic policy, social 
issues, and the economy. The

according to Michaels-Ober, was 
to collect the partys ideas and 
create a platform on the issue 
which would later be presented 
at the debate. We had to be real

because we knew we would have 
to debate them the next night, 
he said.
One student from each sub
committee was then selected to 
participate in the debate Monday 
night, which was moderated by 
Judy Woodruff, one of CNNs top 
political anchors.
It wasnt about who won. 
It was debating to see where 
we stand on important policy 
issues, said Michaels-Ober.
On Tuesday night, the dele
gates were invited to a VIP recep
tion from which they watched 
the actual Vice-Presidential 
debate on television, just outside 
the stage where the debate was 
held.
In our debate there wasnt as 
much cut along Democratic and 
Republican lines  and there 
were no personal attacks, said 
Scocozzo, citing the differenc
es between the real and mock 
debates. Some of the party plat
forms were similar to the larger 
corresponding party, but there 
were some significant differ

A2THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 11, 2004
As readers may have noticed 
in The Tartan this semester, our 
historically popular Crime & 
Incident police blotter has been 
diminishing in size and quality. 
The Tartan offers this space to 
Campus Police as a way to inform 
its readership of important inci
dents they need to know about. 
The piece has also usually enter
tained its readers
There are several problems in 
reporting the occasionally sen
sitive information contained in 
the incident report; agreements 
between Campus Police and 
The Tartan have limited which 
members of our staff may see 
the reports and what information 
can be reprinted. Subjects names 
are not printed unless they were 
given a citation from the city or 
state, or they are notable mem
bers of the campus community. 
Unfortunately, in such a small 
community as ours, information 
given in the reports was consid
ered by many to point obviously 
to unnamed subjects.
As with any submission to The 
Tartan, printing depends on sev
eral criteria. One is that the piece 
is relevant to the readership. A 
second requires that we not com
promise sources. The classic prob
lem with reports such as Crime 
& Incident is weighing the needs 
and rights of the community to 
be informed with the fair privacy 
rights afforded every individual, 
including those reported on by 
the police.
The Crime & Incident report 
is supposed to inform the student 
body in order to keep it safe from 
repeated events. The column, with 
its detailed descriptions of events, 
has lent caution to students about 
safety problems on campus, while 
the entertaining nature kept them 
reading it weekly. From a journal
istic standpoint, the needs of the 
community had outweighed the 
privacy rights.
Earlier this year, Campus Police 
amended its policy on dealing 
with media on campus and in 
Pittsburgh. Where The Tartan 
had once been given full reports
 naturally with overly sensitive 
information blacked out  it was 
decided that this compromised 
the rights of the subjects of the 
reports. Under the new policy, 
all media, not only The Tartan, 
have access only to abbreviated 
reports containing the nature of 
an incident, time and date, loca
tion, and, for many incidents, a 
one-sentence summary.
These new reports have made 
it impossible for The Tartan to 
produce a blotter of the quality 
our readers expect. The shorter 
reports omit information key both 
to fulfilling the safety objective of 
the piece and to narrate success
fully the story that keeps students 
reading.
This past week, a member of 
The Tartans staff was dispatched 
to the Old Student Center to 
retrieve the report and was told 
that it had not been compiled and 
would not be ready for todays 
paper. The Tartan was told at the 
beginning of the semester that 
an advantage of the new system 
was online availablity of reports 
to media around Pittsburgh. This 
h^s not been implemented. The 
Tartan applauds the service the 
police provide campus, and it 
would be remiss to imply oth
erwise, but without complete 
and timely information from our 
colleagues, we cannot continue 
to publish a crime and incident 
report for our readers.
The Tartan has not yet decided 
how to use this space on Page 2, 
but readers can look forward to 
interesting replacements as con
cepts for the space take shape. 
The Tartan hopes that policy will 
change to allow us access to the 
information our readers need, 
and looks forward to resolving 
the issue with Campus Police to 
bring improved incident reports 
to the readership in future issues.

attributed it to Neal Shyam. 
The author of this crossword

In last weeks article Pitts

Id like to talk about a trag
edy that occurred three weeks 
ago at the University of Colorado. 
Gordon Bailey, one of 27 pledges 
at Chi Psi fraternity, died from 
alcohol poisoning. While a hand
ful of college students die from 
alcohol poisoning each year, this 
situation was particularly devas
tating.
Bailey, 18, had just completed 
his fraternity initiation. The pledg
es had been driven blindfolded to 
a nearby forest, ordered to drink 
large amounts of cheap whiskey 
and wine, and then abandoned. 
The pledges were then picked up 
and driven to the fraternity house 
to celebrate.
Bailey soon passed out from the 
alcohol he had drunk during ini
tiation. Because his shoes were 
on, Chi Psi tradition dictated that 
the brothers write on his body 
with felt-tip markers. The slurs 
that covered his body have been 
described as misogynist, racist, 
and above all, vulgar.
Phrases included It sucks to be 
you, F me, and Penis ankle, 
the last drawn on his ankle and 
accompanied by anatomical por
trayals of genitalia. Furthermore, 
the words B and N were 
both written on his body. As these 
words were written, Bailey died.
In the morning, at 9 am, those 
at the party began to notice that 
Bailey was not breathing. Before 
calling an ambulance, they 
attempted to erase the markings 
from his face. When an ambulance 
was finally called, Bailey was pro
nounced dead. His blood-alcohol 
content was 0.328 percent.
If you think something like 
this couldnt happen here, youre 
wrong: It did. On December 11, 
1994, the now-defunct Pi Lambda 
Phi fraternity threw a Christmas 
party in their house on campus. 
Justin Chambers, a sophomore 
materials and science engineering 
student, was a brother of the house 
and attended the party. Employing 
a Secret Santa system, an older 
brother gave Chambers a handle 
of Jack Daniels as a gift. Chambers 
drank the whole thing, passed out 
in the fraternity house, and died. 
His blood alcohol content was 
recorded at 0.54 percent. Nobody 
attempted to revive Chambers, or 
noticed anything odd about the 
fact that he had passed out dur
ing the party. Instead of calling an 
ambulance and saving his life, his 
brothers looked the other way.
There are two lessons here and 
I hope every student pays atten
tion. Firstly, you have to look after 
your friends. Bailey and Chambers 
would still be alive if anyone had 
called the police when they first 
passed out. If you are ever in a 
situation in which a friend loses 
consciousness, take them to the 
hospital. There is no justification 
for doing anything else. Students 
have to look out for each other.
Secondly, there was no justice 
in either case. When Chambers 
died, no CMU students were sus
pended or disciplined beyond an 
alcohol citation. Those brothers 
of Pi Lambda over 21 were given 
state citations of serving alcohol 
to a minor, a misdemeanor. They 
were later acquitted.
Quite simply, just as the broth
ers of these fraternities looked the 
other way as one of their friends 
died, so too does the law look 
the other way. Many of the broth
ers of Chi Psi are not cooperating 
with the police and it should be 
no surprise that none have been 
arrested. Just as CMU did 10 years 
ago, Colorado is refusing to seri
ously discipline any individuals.
Its one thing to have a stu
dent drink too much; we all 
make mistakes. Yet what hap
pened at Chi Psi is a disgrace 
to all students everywhere. 
May we, at CMU, never accept this 
sort of behavior from each other 
again. We deserve better.

A message from your Student Body President, Erik Michaels-Ober
Michaels-Ober
The Presidential and Vice-Presidential 
debates provide a new opportunity for 
undecided students to compare the can
didates side by side, for voters who lean 
toward a particular candidate to compare 
his views to their own, and for firmly com
mitted voters to cheer on their preferred 
candidate. The debates also provide an 
opportunity for nonvoters to learn more 
about current American public issues.
The student government sponsored a 
showing of the first Presidential debate on 
a large screen in Rangos Ballroom. Many 
students attended this event and stayed 
for a discussion afterward. It was one of 
many political events on campus leading 
up to the November 2 general election.
The second Presidential debate, which
occurred last Friday, was in a town-meet
ing format in which questions were asked 
by undecided voters.
Student Pugwash, a nonpartisan stu
dent organization that promotes social 
responsibility in science and technology, 
sponsored a discussion of the debate, 
which focused on the ethics of embryonic 
stem cell research and nuclear prolifera
tion.
Student Pugwash will also be sponsor
ing a showing of the third and final presi
dential debate this Wednesday at 9 pm in 
Doherty 1112. I encourage you to watch 
and discuss this debate, which will focus 
on economic and domestic policy.
This past week, I was in Cleveland for 
the Vice-Presidential debate between Dick 
Cheney and John Edwards. Case Western 
Reserve University invited students from 
fourteen universities to participate in pro
grams leading up to the debate, including
mock Democratic and Republican con
ventions and a mock Vice-Presidential 
debate.
This was a great experience to meet 
student leaders from around the country. 
It was exciting to see so much political 
activity surrounding the Vice-Presidential 
debate, particularly among the youth.
While in Cleveland, I heard historians 
speak about the significance of politi
cal debates. Some of the first debates 
in American political history occurred 
in 1858 between Abraham Lincoln and 
Stephen Douglas, who were running 
against each other for an Illinois Senate 
seat. Lincoln lost the Senate race, but 
the debates brought him recognition that 
helped him win the Presidency two years 
later.
Presidential debates were first broad
cast over the radio in 1948, making them 
accessible to a national audience. The first
televised Presidential debate occurred in 
1960, between Richard Nixon and John 
Kennedy. This debate demonstrated the 
importance of image in addition to mes
sage: a majority of radio listeners believed 
that Nixon had outdone Kennedy, while 
a majority of viewers who watched the 
debate on television thought Kennedy 
won. s
This year, with such a close presiden
tial race, the debates are particularly 
important. The candidates performance 
in Wednesdays final debate could prove 
decisive with the election only three 
weeks away.
I hope you will watch and decide for 
yourself which candidate you prefer.
Please do not hesitate to send e-mail to 
pres@cmu.edu withyour questions or com
ments.

ing] information on Kerry [and] 
absentee ballot applications, and 
also I got information on elderly 
people in the neighborhood who 
may need a ride to the polls on 
Election Day.
Two hours after finishing his 
address, Dean spoke in front 
of local media at a pre-debate 
press conference; he informally 
reviewed his rationale for sup
porting for the Kerry campaign.
Asked to discuss his impression 
of initiatives to register voters on 
college campuses like Carnegie 
Mellon, Dean responded by com
mending the efforts, saying Ive 
never seen this level of activity 
since the Vietnam War. Voter reg
istration, however, is not enough, 
he said. The follow-up is abso
lutely essential. Students have 
got to get out the vote. Dean 
embellished this point during the 
debate, insisting, We need to 
talk not to the swing voters; we 
need to talk to our base of support 
and give them a reason to get out
and vote.
At a separate press conference, 
Reed, head of the Republican 
Party in Georgia, expressed his 
confidence in light of the recent 
Presidential and Vice-Presidential 
debates. I like where we are, 
he said.
The substance of the debate, 
hosted by the Pitt Program Council 
of the University of Pittsburgh, 
was guided by questions from 
the audience and included issues 
such as foreign policy, civil rights, 
the environment, and the ethics 
of campaign spin. Still, the debat
ers gravitated toward the issues 
they wanted to address, causing 
one audience member to call out 
in frustration, Why dont you 
answer our questions?"
Debate moderator Gordon 
Mitchell, an associate professor 
of communication and Director 
of Debate at the University of 
Pittsburgh, praised the audience, 
describing it as a Vocal audience, 
which is refreshing.
would be needed.
The question of discrimination 
has been raised concerning two 
sections of the decision to block 
the Roots concert.
First, whatever decision was 
made concerning the Roots in 
particular, Mosley feels it is un
just to generalize that decision 
into an overall policy which por
trays hip-hop as an entire genre 
in a negative light.
Secondly, it is a significant step 
to single out the entire genre of 
hip-hop as needing extra secu
rity, while in contrast implying 
that other styles of music do not 
have to go through this extra re
issues that unite: jobs, educa
tion, health care, and foreign 
policy. He said that Americans 
need to fundamentally change 
this country; he demanded a 
government for all Americans, 
every single one of us.
Dean stressed the importance 
of widespread individual involve
ment in government at all levels. 
It is easy to blame George Bush 
for everything, Dean warned. 
Instead, he argued that Americans 
must accept responsibility and 
engage themselves: Voting is not 
enough, he said. I want you to 
run for office.
Calling for people to join last 
Saturdays Million Person Door 
Knock for Kerry and Edwards, 
Dean reminded listeners, Every 
vote counts. Yuhasz said, I went 
knocking door-to-door in the 
South Side to try to see if we 
could get people out to vote for 
Kerry. This included [distribut
Kissinger featured, at Heinz Hall
of rebuilding Iraq, bridging com
parisons between this current 
campaign and the Vietnam War.
Having served as Secretary of 
State under Presidents Richard 
Nixon and Gerald Ford, Kissinger 
received the 1973 Nobel Peace 
Prize for his role in helping to 
end the Vietnam conflict. He also 
aided in developing U.S. rela
tions with China and the Middle 
East and promoted a dtente 
policy toward the Soviet Union 
during the Cold War.
Kissingers controversial past 
was brought into play, how
ever, as political writer and 
Kissinger critic Christopher 
Hitchens visited Pittsburgh the 
same night. Hitchens, whose 
appearance was coordinated by 
the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, lec
tured after a showing of Eugene 
Jareckis documentary based 
on Hitchens book The Trials of 
Henry Kissinger. These works 
charge Mr. Kissinger with com
mitting war crimes, namely in 
his support for regimes in South 
America and East Timor several 
decades ago.
Even closer to home, a hand
ful of protesters, led by the 
Pittsburgh Independent Media 
Center, demonstrated in front 
of Heinz Hall prior to Kissingers 
lecture.
I support freedom of speech 
and every persons right to 
state their opinion. Therefore, I 
embraced their action, although 
I do not agree with their state
ments, remarked Robert Morris 
University Director of Public 
Relations Mark Weinstein.
In the most revealing part 
of the night, the question-andanswer portion at the end of 
his lecture, Kissinger confronted 
these allegations by Hitchens and 
others, calling them absurd 
and out of context.
During this part of his talk, 
Kissinger also addressed ques
tions regarding French-American 
relations, future competition 
with China (which he likened 
to a game of Go), his opinion 
on how history will treat former 
President Nixon, and, perhaps 
most entertainingly, his younger 
days as a soccer player.

Former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger visited Heinz 
Hall on Tuesday to speak about 
the demands that the war on terforism has placed on American 
policy making.
Kissinger, whose lecture was 
sponsored by Robert Morris 
Universitys popular Speaker 
Series, warned his audience of 
the dangers, both new and old 
 that America faces today, from 
nuclear proliferation to the peril 
of stateless terrorists. Claiming 
that the past few years have con
tained many seminal moments 
in American history, Kissinger 
addressed the necessity of a 
fresh foreign policy, applauding 
President Bushs doctrine of pre
emption .
Shifting his focus from inter
national threats to Americas role 
in the world, Kissinger touched 
on the delicate pursuit of main
taining global power, remarking 
particularly on the complexity
Jeopardy! features student from CMU
Lori Wallach lectures on global issues
sion dealing with trade-related 
issues, was founded in 1995.
Informing the crowd that 
modern trade agreements have 
little to do with actual trade, 
Wallach focused on the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), 
a global trade body with 147 
members including the United 
States. According to Wallach, the 
General Agreements on Tariffs 
and Trade is the only one of
17 arrangements that deals with 
trade. The remaining agree
ments address the liberalization 
of finance, investment, privati
zation, deregulation, intellectual 
property, and other neo-liberal 
policies dubbed the Washington 
Consensus.
We need totally new rules for 
the global economy, Wallach 
said, criticizing the WTO for 
instituting a race to the bot
tom in labor and environmental 
standards and for being undem
ocratic.
Wallach also spoke out against 
aspects of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, a con
cord between Canada, Mexico, 
and the United States; the pro
posed Central American Free 
Trade Agreement; and the Free 
Trade Area of the Americas.
In proposing to redress t^ie 
WTOs perceived shortcomings, 
Wallach called for the organiza
tion to shrink or sink. Claiming 
that it is a political question, 
a power question, she told the 
audience, These policies will 
affect your generation. Wallach 
urged those who disagreed with 
current trade policies to start 
building power to demand for 
change.
Mark Peterson, a sophomore 
civil and environmental engi
neering major who attended the 
event, said, She had a biased 
view but she made good points. 
If I had to vote on it I would agree 
with what she said, but Im not a 
liberal or anything. She may not 
be taking into consideration all 
the benefits. She seemed more 
interested in the welfare of other 
countries instead of the welfare 
of America.

Claiming that he doesnt 
understand cubism and [has] 
no interest in it, Trebek advised 
CMU students to get a good liber

specifying too early in a certain 
area of study. He said that he uses 
his degree in philosophy to keep 
life in perspective and, if he were 
to invent a religion, would name 
it Pacificum. Trebek speculated 
that the affinity for the show is 
due to the competitive nature of 
Americans, who are searching 
for ways to compare themselves 
with bright people.

Organization? A Comprehensive 
Guide to the WTO, a book she 
co-authored with Patrick

about global trade issues and

Pittsburgh as a city with a great

Fleming agreed, describing

Today, Carnegie Mellons 
Robotics Institute will begin a 
four-day celebration of its 25th 
anniversary. Since its 1979 estab
lishment, the Robotics Institute 
has built a reputation as one of 
the premier robotics outlets in 
the country, with its research 
spanning many disciplines. As a
result, the Institute has had farreaching influence in the fields 
of medicine, autonomous tech
nology, and computer vision. The 
anniversary will bring together 
many of the most successful and 
well-known researchers in the 
country to explore the latest chal
lenges and successes of robotics. 
Activities range from tours of lab
oratories to lectures and business 
networking opportunities.
Although there are lectures

scheduled to cover advanced top
ics, not all of the events are aimed 
solely at those who are already 
studying robotics, engineering, 
or computer science. One of the 
many goals of the anniversary 
is to capture the attention of a 
new student by exposing him or 
her to an unanticipated facet of 
robotics.
A series of free lectures, 
demonstrations, and gallery 
exhibits dubbed Community
Involvement Day will take place 
around campus on Tuesday. 
These exhibits are open to the 
general public; students who are 
interested in robotics are encour
aged to attend. We have some 
great roboticists from within 
Carnegie Mellon who will be 
speaking and giving demonstra
tions.... These [talks] will be 
well worthwhile, said Robotics 
Institute Director Matt Mason. 
Tuesday will undoubtedly pro
vide students with the most 
opportunities to be part of the 
events. Over a dozen lectures 
will take place in the University 
Center, their topics ranging from 
social to microand nano-scale 
robots. The presentations will 
take place inside and outside the 
University Center, and on the 
Cut. Students will be able watch 
a video about a mobile robot 
named Zoe which has potential 
applications for Mars explora
tion, learn about the Gyrover, an 
enclosed single-wheel robot that 
has the ability to traverse rough 
terrain, or share their Tartan 
pride by hearing a robot bag
piper perform.
The artistic implications of 
robotics will be not be neglect
ed. The Tech Gallery, an exhib
it which will be featured in 
Newell-Simon Hall B Level opens 
Tuesday and closes with a recep
tion on Thursday. Its goal is to 
expose visitors to exhibits that
reflect the inspiration by and for 
research with robotics, with an 
emphasis on visual creativity. 
Furthermore, the show empha
sizes Carnegie Mellons collabo
ration between technology and 
the arts that has already captured 
the hearts of its early attendees. 
The Da Vinci Effect is slated to 
run Wednesday and Thursday. 
The show on Wednesday will 
bring the Grand Challenges of 
Robotics' Symposium, and lec
tures by distinguished profes
sors from around the country. 
The week culminates Thursday 
night with a concert by Laura 
Anderson, NASAs first artist in 
residence. Her performance, an 
eclectic mixture of many medi
ums, will showcase work from 
her latest album, the End of the 
Moon.
The events of the anniver
sary will reinforce the Robotics 
Institutes position in the com
munity and hopefully bring new 
minds into the discipline. The 
Institute believes that only expo
sure to the research underway 
will fully explain what happens 
there. The anniversary will be 
an opportunity to expose the 
population to cutting-edge tech
nology. Unless you come and 
visit, you cant really appreciate 
the scope of whats going on 
here. Its not something you can 
imagine unless you see it, said 
Mason.
CMU-UPitt LearnLab program recieves $25 million grant
by John Gross
Layout Staff
Last Utesday, the National Science Foundation jointly 
awarded Carnegie Mellon University and the University 
of Pittsburgh one of three $25 million federal grants to 
be used towards the study of learning and better edu
cation. This innovative endeavor is being co-directed 
by faculty members from both universities including 
Carnegie Mellon associate professor of human-computer 
interaction and psychology Kenneth Koedinger and Kurt 
VanLehn, a University of Pittsburgh computer science 
professor and senior scientist of Pitts Learning Research 
and Development Center.
In the beginning of the selection process, 60 different 
colleges and universities applied for grant money. Eventu
ally, the group was narrowed down to 12, and then to the 
final three. The other two awardees of the grant money 
were Boston University and a joint program between the 
University of Washington and Stanford University.
Koedinger and VanLehn together will use their grant 
towards managing the Pittsburgh Science of Learning 
Center. A major part of the center includes an educational 
facility nicknamed LearnLab, which provides technolo
gy for Koedinger and VanLehn to use to help explain why 
certain educational methods work better compared to 
other ones. I think were going to fundamentally change
how students learn, said Koedinger.
Over the next five years, experimental and obser
vational studies will occur in high school and college 
settings, with high emphasis on computer education. 
Experimenting and testing out theories in laboratory 
and classroom settings are the only current plans as yet. 
Researchers plan to try out all different approaches in 
several courses including two high-school mathematics 
classes, two college science classes, and three college lan
guage classes. The courses include algebra and geometry, 
chemistry and physics, and Chinese, French, and English. 
Approaches include learning through technology, tutor
ing systems, and tracking student processes and progress 
with the simple yet challenging goal of improving educa
tion. An added advantage with the tracking of student 
progress is that researchers will be able to see the benefits 
that arise through the tracking from the beginning to end 
of the studies.
Carnegie Learning, a currently existing high school 
program, will be involved with LearnLab. Koedinger 
stressed that there needs to be a balance between the 
realism of experiments in the classroom and the rigor of 
experiments in a lab setting.
Under the No Child Left Behind bill, each school is 
required to be able to show an improvement in academic 
performance. Thus, with this grant money, Koedinger 
hopes that proven instructional techniques can be devel
oped through this program. Koedinger stated, This is a

very timely and needed endeavor.
With more progression in the studies, Koedinger hopes 
to be able to send college students from both universities 
to various high schools to serve as role models, tutors and 
aids to the experiments. We hope to produce trustwor
thy results about education.

When you take a call on your 
cell phone, listen to the radio 
as you drive down the highway, 
or tune into satellite television 
at home, you probably take for 
granted how those signals are 
getting to you. It was Arthur 
C. Clarke who so aptly put it: 
Any sufficiently advanced 
technology is indistinguishable 
from magic. And if you took for 
granted the technology behind 
todays wireless wonders, you 
never even gave a thought to 
the policy that lets them exist. 
Welcome to the exciting world 
of spectrum policy, in which 
our representatives in the U.S. 
government have been laying 
down the law for almost 80 
years.
Spectrum policy has its origins 
in the Radio Act of1927, in which 
Congress established the the 
Federal Radio Commission, the 
first regulatory organization for 
the airwaves. It wasnt for seven 
years, however, that more com
prehensive rules were passed
Bridget Lewis/Art Staff
with the Communications Act of 
1934. One of the major results 
of this act was the creation of 
the Federal Communications 
Commission, or FCC.
The FCC, under the auspic
es of the Communication Act, 
establishes and supervises pol
icy regarding commercial uses 
of wired and wireless commu
nications in the United States. 
Over the years, there have 
been many amendments to the 
Federal Communications Act to 
keep pace with technology, but 
its spirit remains intact.
Unfortunately, the public has 
very little knowledge of what 
the FCC actually does. That is 
because the nature of spectrum 
policy is very technical, and 
the effects of such policy arent 
readily seen. When was the last 
time you cared about at what 
frequency maritime navigation 
radio or garage door openers 
operated? With just a little edu
cation, this can be changed. We 
can start with some basic infor
mation about the electromag
netic spectrum.
Most people know that light 
travels in waves. It turns out
that light is only one part of a 
continuum of electromagnetic 
phenomena; these phenomena 
are characterized by their fre
quency, which is a measure of 
how many times a wave moves 
from crest to crest in a constant 
period of time. The accepted 
unit of frequency is the Hertz 
(abbreviated Hz) one cycle per 
second.
By drawing a line that rep
resents low frequencies on the 
left and high frequencies on the 
right, one can set up the electro
magnetic spectrum and divide it 
into parts. From left to right, the 
common bands of the spectrum 
are known as: radio, micro
wave, infrared, visible light, 
ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma 
rays. These many types of waves 
are all just photons of different 
wavelengths. Over the years sci
entists have given bands of the 
spectrum different names for 
expedience. It is much easier 
to say radio waves than 500 
MHz electromagnetic radia
tion.
With a basic understand
ing of electromagnetic waves, 
spectrum policy becomes a little 
friendlier. Spectrum policy is 
primarily concerned with radio 
and microwaves ranging from 
3 kHz to 300 GHz. It is at these 
frequencies that wireless com
munication is most viable. For 
example, you wouldnt want 
to listen to your favorite rock 
station on a gamma-ray radio; 
the sheer energy these high fre
quencies carry would probably 
give you radiation poisoning 
before the song was finished.
Frequencies lower than 3 kHz 
are also impractical. Because 
their wavelengths are so large, 
they would need proportion
ally larger antennas. The Navy 
recently closed a 28-mile-long 
antenna in Wisconsin that 
allowed it to communicate with
ballistic missile submarines 
deep under the ocean.
With the battle lines drawn, 
the question remains who gets 
which frequencies. Many peo
ple compare the spectrum to a 
natural resource, like oil; its dis
tribution is very important. The 
government reserves almost 70 
percent of the usable spectrum 
for itself. Every government 
radio application, from mili
tary satellites and forest ranger 
walkie-talkies to CIA communi
cations and air traffic control, 
takes place on these reserved 
frequencies.
Not surprisingly, a separate 
agency is responsible for governmentallocationoffrequency: the 
National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration 
(NTIA). The FCC has no con
trol over use of these govern
ment frequencies. There are 
several rationales behind this: 
Reserving a wide band of fre
quencies for themselves ensures 
that the government will never 
have to pay third parties for 
communications. The NTIA, in 
the interests of national secu
rity, can keep the usage of cer
tain frequency bands classified. 
The downside of this is that 
very little oversight exists to see 
if these frequencies are being 
used efficiently.
The remaining 30 percent of 
the radio spectrum is doled out 
by the FCC. They classify fre
quencies in two ways: licensed 
and unlicensed. Unlicensed 
spectrum may be used by any
one, anytime. Unfortunately, 
there are no guarantees against 
signal interference with unli
censed spectrum. This usually 
isnt a problem with unlicensed 
spectrum because many devices 
operating on these bands are 
low power, such as cordless 
phones, EZ-Pass tags, wireless 
LANs, and microwave ovens.
Licensed spectrum makes up 
the bulk - 98 percent - of the fre
quencies given out by the FCC. 
Cell phones, radio, and televi
sion are the primary users of 
licensed spectrum, and they are 
big business. Television adver
tising revenue in 2001 was over 
$35 billion. Radio had almost 
$20 billion in revenue. With 
this kind of money, politics are 
bound to get involved, and the 
FCC hasnt escaped. Over the 
years, companies have lobbied 
the FCC for use of certain fre
quencies  say, the 2 GHz range 
for satellite radio. It used to be 
the case that companies would 
get what they wanted. Until 
the last decade or so, unused 
frequencies were still available, 
but that is no longer the case.
Today, frequencies are 
becoming scarce. Consequently, 
theyre becoming much more 
valuable. This forces compa
nies to innovate more efficient 
uses of spectrum, so weve seen 
many advances in communica
tions technology. Even so, the 
value of certain frequencies has 
skyrocketed - up to $1 billion 
per MHz for certain bands in 
cellular use. Some people have 
begun to question why the FCC 
was giving away such valuable 
frequencies as political favors, 
so they responded by forming 
an investigative group known as 
the Spectrum Policy Task Force. 
It is this groups job to evaluate 
80 years of policy and deter
mine where reform is needed, 
One recommendation theyve 
made is the increased use of 
spectrum auctions, where fre
quencies are sold to the highest 
bidder. The Bush administra
tion hopes to make over $25 
billion on spectrum auctions in 
the near future. Keep that in 
mind the next time you are on 
your cell phone and you hear 
someone say Talk is cheap.

of the cow. Researchers hope 
to publish a full version of the 
genome next year, and plan to 
use the data to improve meat and 
dairy production in cows. The 
international research team ana

Stem cells shown 
to help body heal
New research shows that stem 
cells, already known for their 
ability to turn into any other cell 
in the body, produce chemicals 
that help the healing process. 
Researcher Robert Benezra of 
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center and his team 
found that chemicals secreted by 
stem cells helped create impor
tant proteins in other cells, allow
ing them to live for much longer 
than they otherwise would have 
been able to.
The team studied mouse 
embryos that lacked a protein 
from a group known as Id, which 
prevents cardiac cells from devel
oping normally and so kills the 
embryos; with the stem cells, 
several mice survived.

Anti-spyware bills 
pass House floor
Members of the House of 
Representatives voted over
whelmingly to support two 
bills aimed at ending the spyware problem by targeting dis
tributors. The bills must still go 
through the Senate to become 
law, and supporters of the bills 
are concerned that the Senate 
will not have enough time to pass 
them before its next recess.
The first bill, which passed 
415-0, would put some convict
ed distributors of spyware in jail 
for up to five years. The sec
ond, which passed 399-1, would 
fine distributors every time they 
installed spyware on a comput
er.

Better evidence of 
Mars water found
New data from the NASA 
rover Opportunity provided the 
strongest evidence yet that water 
once existed on Mars. A rock 
named Escher, located in the 
Endurance Crater, contained a 
network of cracks that looked 
like dried mud would on Earth. 
According to NASA analysts, the 
new findings differ enough from 
previous findings that they point 
to a separate water event; the 
area was likely flooded on two 
separate occasions.

II October 2004
Likely voter metric marred by 
poor polling methodologies
The producers of the Gallup Poll are 
unlikely to read this editorial. At least, 
one can make that claim using a poor
ly designed and untenable metric. The 
producers of the Gallup Poll have been 
doing just that: for years they have been 
misrepresenting the facts by in reporting 
their polls based on a very poorly defined 
set of likely voters.
Polls themselves can affect elections, 
and none more than the quadrennial 
Presidential election poll. In doing so, 
they must reflect the actual attitudes 
of voting Americans. Gallup has under
taken so-called polls on polls, wherein 
they show the importance of public con
fidence not only in the polling numbers 
but also in the polling process; they make 
their predictions based on a randomly 
selected group of only 1000 adult citizens 
and claim that since halving the margin 
of error would mean quadrupling the 
sample size, larger samples are prohibi
tively expensive. But they may interview 
that many anyway, because before they 
select an interviewee for inclusion in 
those 1000, Gallup must mark a person 
as a likely voter.
In this election cycle, however, Gallups 
formula for selecting likely voters has 
come under attack for waxing conserva
tive and skewing results in favor of the 
President. Gallup has been predicting bet
ter performance by George W. Bush than 
most other polls, and an examination 
of its results shows why: Approximately 
40 percent of Gallups likely voters are 
Republican, and about 10 percent fewer 
identify themselves as Democrats.
Gallup determines its set of likely vot
ers based not on party percentages or 
2000 election exit polls, but on a ques
tionnaire. Questions such as whether a 
person has voted in previous elections 
and interest in politics decide who consti
tutes the group. Several of these questions
 combined with polling only household 
telephones  remove younger, and likely 
more liberal, Americans from the Gallup 
polls. Younger voters may not have been 
voters in the 2000 election  obviously 
not those 18-21  and they are far more 
likely to live in a non-land-line, mobilephone-only household. Other problems 
arise from questionable interest in poli
tics and the election. The most egregious 
disparities between registered and likely 
voters came right after the Republican 
convention, when interest among Bush 
supporters surged and their numbers 
overwhelmed likely voter metrics.
Zogby International has been one of 
the biggest critics of the Gallup orga
nization in the past several months of 
the 2004 election cycle. Founder and 
CEO John Zogby claims that the dispar
ity between the likely voter results and 
the registered voter results is due to 
an outdated likely voter model. Zogby 
is a proponent of weighting results by 
anticipated party ratios and overall likeli
ness party to vote. Gallup claims that this 
cannot be known from census data and 
refuses to consider using these data in 
any capacity for their polling, but a com
promise between the two may exist.
Gallup can weight its registered vot
ers result, not using census data, but 
by averaging likely voter questionnaires 
from months before their actual poll 
takes place. It would eliminate tempo
rally local spikes while still considering 
likelihood for any individual actually to 
enter the booth on November 2.
The Gallup Organization should 
change their polling practices to reflect 
reality. Not doing so is likely to harm 
voter education efforts and unduly influ
ence the election  naturally, within a 
margin of error.
Unisex bathrooms in UC excellent 
step to address GLBTIQ concerns
Transgender students and the GLBITQ 
community have voiced concerns with 
the current bathroom situation in the 
University Center. They feel that a simple 
male or female choice does not adequate
ly address their needs. Having to choose 
between male and female bathrooms 
and locker rooms presents them with a 
problem that they do not feel they should 
have to face. Transgender students do not 
identify with the standard societal defini
tions of male and female and can may un
comfortable being in either bathroom.
Student Body Vice-President Julie 
Beckenstein is taking the right steps in 
advocating for the existence of a unisex 
bathroom in the University Center. This is 
a low-cost solution to the problem. This 
endeavor is something that the Univer
sity should pursue more diligendy.
Unisex bathrooms may be better de
scribed as genderless bathrooms. The 
bathroom is intended for use by a single 
person, with a lock on the door. This 
bathroom would be available for use for 
any member of the CMU community, and 
would decrease waiting time for a bath
room by having several that served not 
only transgender students, but the male 
and female populations as well.
The best solution to this problem is to 
have a place where students can change 
or go to the bathroom alone. A single-use 
bathroom would address these needs, 
as well as address other concerns faced 
by the campus community including the 
problems faced by parents with small 
children. A single-use genderless bath
room would be available to all students 
and would exclude no one.
Such a bathroom could be created very 
inexpensively. There exist bathrooms on 
the third floor and basement of the UC 
which have particularly low traffic. Put
ting a privacy lock on the exterior door of 
one of these bathrooms would convert it 
into a unisex bathroom. There is no need 
to address issues of plumbing, construc
tion, or relocation.
Furthermore, nobody would be dis
placed as the original users of these bath
rooms would still be able to use them. 
The only potential problem would be 
the loss of capacity in these bathrooms, 
which could result in a short wait to use 
them.
There are already bathrooms on the 
second floor of the UC that meet the de
scription of a unisex bathroom. There 
are two in the seldom-used hallway to 
the left of the Deli across from the Grab 
n Go. One is labeled male and the oth
er, female. This situation is not optimal 
because if there are two females or two 
males looking to use the restroom, one 
would be expected to wait for the other to 
finish instead of using the bathroom pres
ently labeled for the other sex despite the 
fact that it is the exact same single toi
let and sink setup. So long as this is the 
case, those gender restrictive signs serve 
absolutely no purpose and can be taken 
down.
While there are unisex bathrooms in 
other parts of the campus, there should 
be one in the UC. The University Center 
belongs to the students and should ad
dress their needs. Unisex bathrooms are 
a simple and elegant solution; the Uni
versity should move ahead with it.

A call for a roommate revolution at CMU
Annalisa Schaefer
Haseeb Qureshi/Art Staff
The Port Authority of Allegheny 
County is facing a $30 million funding 
shortage in the fiscal year beginning 
July 1, 2004. They will resort to unprec
edented measures to offset this deficit 
if no sustainable source of funding is 
found. If implemented, these service 
reductions and fare increases will great
ly injure the local economy and cut the 
number of trips in half: 125,000 fewer 
than the current number. These cuts 
do nothing to improve quality of life or 
reduce Pittsburghers dependence on 
the personal automobile.
Complete elimination of Saturday, 
Sunday, and holiday bus, rail, and 
ACCESS Paratransit service is planned, 
along with the discontinuation of week
day service after 9 in the evening. In 
addition, an undisclosed number of 
operators will be laid off. The ones who 
would most be affected by these cuts 
would be the elderly; low-income work
ers; and certainly students. Furthermore, 
the base fare will increase to $2.50. The 
Port Authority has raised fares twice 
since April 2000, from $1.25 to $1.60 
and now $1.75 base fare. In September 
2002, a seven percent reduction of ser
vice was implemented, cutting some 
direct Oakland service and 24-hour ser
vice. Just recently the UV Loop was 
eliminated. It was the only Friday and 
Saturday transportation to the hot spots 
of the city, such as the South Side and 
the Strip, except for the 54C line, which 
quits after 1 am.

I believe it is missing one mandatory 
workshop that we desperately need: 
How to Be a Roommate.
Now, as much as Id like to believe 
that college-age people are able to fig
ure out how to live with another per
son amiably, that is simply untrue. It 
has been proven to me repeatedly, both 
in my own experience and from lis
tening to others stories, that many (if 
not most) kids just cant handle it. Its 
understandable; unless you grew up 
sharing a bedroom with a sibling or you 
lived in a one-room cabin straight out of 
Little House on the Prairie, its a bit of an 
adjustment for everybody.
Based on what Ive observed, room
mate disasters stem from two sources: 
roommate issues and interpersonal 
issues. Roommate issues include noise 
level in the room, number of friends 
in the room, and things of that nature. 
Housing has roommate issues fairly well 
covered with their roommate agree
ment form and the RAs. When I was a 
first-year, my RA made it mandatory for 
every roommate pair to complete a form 
and keep carbon copies.
The thing was, the roommate agree
ment form couldnt make my first-year 
roommate understand that sometimes 
she needed to balance her needs with 
mine. We had informally agreed to use 
the phone out in the hallway when the 
other person was in the room; I stuck to 
it, spending many hours in the hallway 
on the phone with my family and boy
friend. Strangely, that didnt stop her 
from repeatedly pressing buttons on the 
phone at 10 oclock one Saturday morn
ing while I was trying to sleep. Dazed, 
I sat up in bed and said, I thought
we agreed not to use the phone in the 
room? She retorted, Im just dialing. I 
explained to her that the buttons beep
ing was preventing me from sleeping, 
but she just gave me a stare and contin
ued her activity. I didnt understand it: I 
had upheld my end of the bargain and 
been polite, yet it wasnt enough.
This leads me to interpersonal issues. 
I firmly believe that there is a sickness

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 11, 2004
Debates emphasize candidates appearance over substance
(fin*/-D-efj/iJames Auwaerter
A Presidential candidate appears shaky 
in the first of the debates. He looks sweaty 
and off his stride. His challenger is tan and 
speaks confidently, endearing himself to 
the television viewers. When the election 
comes, the results are very close, and voter 
fraud may be the cause for the winners 
slight margin of victory. Sound familiar? 
No, its not the 2000 election  its 1960. 
And just like in 1960, people appear to be 
paying more attention to how the candi
dates appear than what they say.
The difference was so great back in 1960 
that people who listened to the debates over 
the radio thought that Nixon won, and tele
vision viewers widely agreed that Kennedy 
was the winner. While nearly all people 
nowadays watch the debates on television 
(or occasionally on streaming webcasts), 
this amplifies the focus on how well the 
candidates appear. Both sides know this. 
Among the ground rules for the debates 
(listed officially in the Memorandum of 
Understanding, available at www.johnkerry.com/pdf/pr_2004_0920b.pdf) are that 
the temperature remain appropriate 
throughout the debate, no risers or any 
other device to create an impression of 
elevated height be used, and that each 
candidate is only allowed to move about 
in a predesignated area that may not 
overlap with the other candidates. The 
complaint that the debates are little more 
than opportunities for Kerry and Bush to 
spew prepackaged sound bites at us has a 
lot of truth to it.
With two Presidential debates and the 
sole Vice-Presidential debate complet
ed, there is only one Presidential debate 
remaining this year. Kerry was widely 
seen as the winner in the first Presidential 
debate, while the Vice-Presidential debate 
and second Presidential debate emerged 
with neither side being able to claim a 
conclusive victory. The question is: What 
does winning the debate mean? More and
more, it is appearance that matters, rather 
than what is actually said.
William Saletan, chief political corre
spondent for Slate.com, excoriated Kerry 
for missing an opportunity to score points 
for candor in the second debate. Liz 
Marlantes, speaking in the Christian Science 
Monitor, said that the Vice-Presidential 
debate unfolded as people expected, spe
cifically on the definite contrast in styles 
 Cheney came across as serious, sober, 
even-keeled.... Edwards came across as sin
cere, empathetic. This was the first thing 
mentioned, even before the points that 
Edwards and Cheney raised. Certainly, a 
great deal of material was covered by the 
Presidential and Vice-Presidential candi
dates, but generally, it was buried under 
the feelings that each candidate inspired.
Certainly, there are places where style
matters. People will not take positions 
seriously if they are held by someone who 
appears mentally unstable, even if the 
position itself makes perfect sense. There 
is also an expectation of how a statesman 
is supposed to act. When one fails to do so 
 Khrushchev about to bang a table with 
his shoe at the UN, Deans scream  he 
undercuts his ability to deal with others 
both inside and outside the country effec
tively. Bush certainly showed his frustra
tion in the first debate, jumping to respond 
to a point and then having to pause sev
eral seconds to phrase himself in a way 
that wouldnt give more red meat to those 
collecting Bushisms. Whether this poor 
showing would continue was answered 
in the second debate, where the more 
informal town hall format allowed Bush to 
move around and come across much more
Lizza McGregor/Art Editor
calmly. With this came a commensurately 
better showing in the post-debate polls.
The best suggestion that I have for those 
people who are interested in finding out 
the candidates positions on everything 
from foreign policy with the Axis of Evil to 
the proper ways to handle tort reform is to 
go to the primary sourcesthe candidates 
websites, position papers, and records. The 
platforms of the candidates speak to what 
they believe in more clearly than any oneminute rebuttal ever can, and though even 
these platforms are crafted to appeal to 
the most people, the records always reflect 
what each man truly believes in.

Sterns move shows limits of free speech
Ben Hackett
The King of All Media has chosen 
a new format as his queen. After 
nearly 25 years of traditional radio, 
Howard Stern has announced his 
plan to move to satellite radio in 
2006. That means there will be 
only 15 more months of Howard 
on traditional free radio. Howard 
will leave Infinity Broadcasting for 
a 100-million-dollar-per-year deal 
with Sirius over five years. This 
move came as a great shock to the 
already embattled radio industry. 
Struggling with declining advertis
ing revenue, conglomerate pres
sure, and scrutiny from the FCC 
over content, Sterns jump could 
not have come at a worse time.
Howard Stern is a radio pioneer. 
He is the most popular radio per
sonality of all time, pushing the 
limits of free speech on the radio. 
Sterns morning radio show airs 
in 46 markets. In many of these 
markets it is the number one show 
in the key 18-to-49-year-old-male 
demographic. With his popular
ity apparent, why would Howard 
Stern leave the radio format that he 
helped innovate? Simply, Howard 
is making a timely, vivid political 
statement. Stern has been one of 
the targets of the recent FCC inde
cency crackdown.
The Federal Communications 
Commission proposed a $495,000 
fine against Clear Channel 
Communications for comments 
made by Stern. Following this pro
posal, Sterns show was dropped 
by Clear Channel Communications 
in April. In June, Clear Channel 
agreed to pay a record $1.75 mil
lion settlement with the FCC to 
settle complaints against Stern 
and other associated personali
ties. Already serving as a foil for 
the FCC, Howard also had strong 
feelings against Clear Channel for 
backing down to the FCC, saying, 
Clear Channel, you ****, I will 
bury you.
Howard Stern relishes his role as 
a free speech martyr. After listening 
to Stern while sitting on the hood of 
my car on September 11, watching 
the towers fall, I know that Stern 
cares deeply about this country. 
The human condition he embodied 
that day exposed his most sincere 
side. While his politics might lean 
a little left, Stern will find support 
across the political spectrum for his 
current cause.
Stern places blame on the cur
rent administration for the FCC 
crackdown. The FCC has author
ity to regulate content broadcast 
free over the public airwaves. This 
includes both on television and 
radio. The FCC lacks authority over 
cable television or satellite radio, 
however. Though the administra
tion may have some control over 
the FCC, there is an underlying 
issue that remains to be addressed. 
The countrys shift towards over
regulation is rearing its ugly head 
in the FCCs current crackdown on 
indecency. Stern may align him
self as a liberal, but on this issue he 
is a true Libertarian.
The arrogance of a government
body that thinks itself a proper 
judge of morality for the rest of 
the nation is shocking. Though 
there is an obvious financial incen
tive for Stern to jump-- to satellite, 
the moral reasons are worth his 
time and attention as well. Perhaps 
Stern will serve as a catalyst for 
some type of public referendum, a 
potential change in how this coun
try allows itself to be regulated to 
death.
Howard is relying on his fan base 
to propel his protest into main
stream America. Since Sirius satel
lite radio is not a free service, fans 
will be required to shell out the 12- 
dollars-a-month service fee. Unlike 
conventional radio, satellite radio 
is not bound by federal indecency 
scrutiny. Recently, shock jocks Opie 
and Anthony, kicked off the air 
for airing a sex stunt in a house 
of worship, found new life on XM 
radio. This freedom is granted due 
to Siriuss being a service with a 
subscription fee. Stern believes that 
this newfound freedom will allow 
his top-rated show to flourish fully.
Fascist-like policy in the guise of 
indecency regulation cannot and 
should not be allowed to constrain 
the evolution of free speech. On the 
day of Sterns announcement, citi
zens generated an early response in 
the greatest forum of them all, the 
free market, as shares of Sirius rose
18 percent. However, only time will 
tell if Sterns choice will impact 
policy in the United States.

PAT budget gap requires

TRANSIT, from A8
These cuts would devas
tate the campus community. 
Everyone would be limited 
to weekday travel and would 
have difficulty going beyond 
walking distance. In addition, 
students could be victims of 
increased crime because they 
will have to walk to their des
tinations when the buses do 
not run. The fare increases 
will also affect the students 
when the contract runs out 
for the free rides. Compared 
to todays $38 per semester 
charge, students may have to 
pay as much as $55 per semes
ter based on the proportional 
increase of the base fare. Even 
worse is the thought of los
ing the free ride program, 
forcing students to reach for 
$2.25 each time they travel.
Pittsburgh is not alone 
with this issue. Philadelphias 
Southeastern Pennsylvania 
Transportation Authority 
(SEPTA) proposed the same 
measures  eliminating all 
weekend and holiday service 
along with a 20 percent reduc
tion in weekday service for its 
city and suburban transit divi
sions. Around one quarter of a 
million daily riders would be 
left in the dust: 25 percent of 
their current daily ridership.
The best solution to the 
problem is to increase gov
ernment funding of the Port 
Authority. Since the early 
1990s, funding has either 
remained steady or been 
reduced each year. There are 
two bills expected to alleviate 
the problem  state Senate 
Bill 1162 and House BUI 2697. 
Both have the common goal 
of tapping into the sales tax 
revenues to increase funds 
for transit agencies across 
Pennsylvania without an 
increase in the sales tax. In 
addition, a $75 million cap on 
the existing sales tax proposal 
would be lifted to encourage 
growing subsidies for the tran
sit providers. The bill propos
es that the funds can be used 
either for operating expenses 
or for capital projects such 
as the subway extensions. If 
passed, the measure would 
eliminate the Port Authoritys 
deficit within the first year, 
and the funds would grow as 
the measure would closely 
follow economic trends.
By voicing your concerns 
to Pennsylvania legislators 
through letter-writing cam
paigns, the transit funding 
may come. Act as soon as 
possible, as the Senate and 
House sessions will end at 
the beginning of November.

Roommate issues cause 
legitimate concerns
ROOMMATES, from A8
tion. She had no answer. I sug
gested that when she went to bed, 
I would turn off my monitor and 
go to bed also, then get up early 
in the morning to finish any work 
I had left. She happily agreed.
What was I doing wrong with 
my roommates? I made it plain 
that I wanted to fix problems as 
they arose. I didnt raise my voice, 
didnt call names, didnt scold: 
My crime, it seems to me, was 
being businesslike about confron
tations. I treated them like prob
lems that needed to be solved. 
Beforehand I composed myself 
and planned out a polite way to 
approach the matter. I used Istatements, which, if you read 
womens magazines, youll find 
are considered the correct way 
to confront somebody. You dont 
tell them Youre doing this thing 
thats bothering me, you phrase 
it this way: Im having a problem 
with this thing youre doing. I 
tried to employ all the correct 
techniques, said nothing with 
hurtful intentions, and I even sug
gested possible solutions, but no 
success. They still got offended 
and refused to compromise.
I dont want to believe that my 
roommates were upset because 
anything other than their way 
was unacceptable. Maybe thats 
how it was, but whatever the case, 
I firmly believe that CMU should 
provide a mandatory workshop 
for students to learn how to con
front each other politely and to 
compromise. If you live with 
somebody (or several somebod
ies), you need to accept that they 
have different living styles than 
you do, that you may bother them 
in ways you would never have 
expected, and that they have just 
as much right as you do to have a 
restful place to return to after a 
day of classes and activities.
A combination of factors causes 
our students present impover
ished capacity for negotiation. 
Most of us are used to having 
our own bedrooms. Society seems 
to condone walking away from 
problems if you cannot get your 
way; after all, we even have a 
phrase for the silent treatment. 
These are factors which injure the 
roommate relationship, but they 
can be fixed, and I think CMU can
start the healing.
There is a big problem with 
the CMU roommate situation 
from the beginning: The list of 
questions for choosing a room
mate is extremely limited. When 
I was filling out Housing forms 
three years ago, I remember there 
being three questions: Do you 
smoke? Are you a night person or 
a morning person? How often do 
you clean your room?
I understand that Housing also 
makes an effort to place students 
with similar majors together, 
as well as pairing kids whose 
answers to those three magic 
questions match somewhat. Yet as 
a result of this quiz, I, a procrasti
nating, artsy pack-rat, was paired 
with a psychology major who was 
extremely neat and only stayed 
up late when she had friends in 
the room to socialize with, which 
was every night. There was a 
huge disparity in how we did our 
work, the noise levels we were 
comfortable with, our sleeping 
schedules, and our weekday 
social lives, which caused a great 
deal of (silent) conflict. At least 
we were both nonsmokers.
More elements need to be 
taken into consideration when 
pairing up roommates. To have 
such a limited number is abso
lutely ridiculous. Even Brown 
University does a better job with 
its eight-question survey. Ideally, 
there should be 20 to 30 ques
tions. Brown includes some 
important ones that CMU over
looks: Can you sleep with back
ground noise (music, TV, com
puter, roommates guests, etc.) 
or a light in the room? Where do 
you prefer to study? Its not that 
great, but its a start.
In planning next years 
Orientation, the Office of 
Orientation & First-Year Programs 
should seriously consider my pro
posal: Teach kids how to be good 
roommates. The skills they learn 
will help them with relationships 
for the rest of their lives.

Quantum Origins of the Classical

JOj.fi
Quantum mechanics is weird. It allows objects to be simultaneously here 
and there (quantum superpositions), and mandates strange, unusually 
strong correlations (quantum entanglement). I will discuss these 
manifestations of the quantum principles. They are by now well 
established experimentally. Indeed, quantum weirdness may soon be put 
to work (e.g., in quantum computing). But our familiar Universe  even/Tf -if, on the surface, it appears to follow laws different from these observed 
by its quantum ingredients - may well be quantum to the core.

The Carnegie Mellon mens soc

of Chicago for a University 
Athletic Association (UAA) con
test and came away with a 0-0 
tie on Saturday. Carnegie Mellon 
moves to 5-1-2 overall and to 
0-0-2 in UAA play while the 13th

Carnegie Mellon is ranked fifth

the UAA while Chicago is ranked 
second in the Central Region. 
Carnegie Mellon owns a 14-1-
2 series edge over the Maroons 
starting from their first match in 
1987. Chicago earned its only vic

score of 1-0.
Carnegie Mellon will host the 
University of Rochester on Friday

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team traveled to Chicago 
on Saturday to face the conference 
rival Maroons, and came away 
with a hard fought 0-0 draw. The 
Tartans improved their overall 
record to 6-1-3. They are 0-1-1 
within the University Athletic 
Association (UAA).
Carnegie Mellon out-shot 15thranked Chicago 11-9, in what 
Tartans head coach Heather 
Kendra labeled a fantastic game, 
with the momentum shifting back 
and forth the entire match.
Senior goalkeeper Megan 
Monroe made some clutch saves 
to ensure that her team came 
away with at least one point in 
this important UAA match-up, and 
after 90 minutes and two 10-min
ute overtime periods, she walked 
away with her seventh shutout 
of the year. Monroe is tied for the 
conference lead in shutouts.
We created some very danger
ous chances, especially late in the 
game and during both overtimes, 
added Kendra. It was a super 
game, tough to draw, but the 
girls played some fantastic soccer 
today. It was our most complete 
match to date.
Carnegie Mellon hosts two con
ference opponents this week as 
they look to get their first UAA 
win. On Friday, the Tartans host 
the University of Rochester at 
5:30 pm.

At the CMU cross country invite 
in Schenley park Saturday, the 
mens cross country team placed 
first overall with a 72-point lead 
over the second place finishers, 
St. Vincent.
It was a large race with a total 
of 14 teams and 140 runners. 
Juniata, Grove City, Penn State 
Behrend, and Geneva were the 
other schools to place in the top 
six of the competition. It was a 
strong day for Carnegie Mellon. 
Eight members of the team placed 
in the top 15. Nick End, Matt 
Meurer, and Dana Irrer placed 
first, second, and third respec
tively, followed by Geoff Misek in 
fifth, Mike Bridenbaugh in sev
enth, Chris Carroll in 12th, and 
first-year Mark Tressler in 13th.
End, a junior, set a school course 
record time of 26:05, said of the 
race: As a team, we all knew that 
the important part of the season 
started today. We focused on run
ning well and almost all of us came 
away with races we are proud of.
The course was an 8k, which is 
approximately five miles, making 
it slightly longer than the regular 
4.2-mile course that the men run 
at Schenley Park. This adds a brutal 
hill to the course before the 800- 
meter finish at the oval. Many team 
members commented on the chal
lenge of this hill, yet approximately 
half the team set personal records 
for themselves on this course.
I was feeling good throughout 
the race, and when I hit the oval, 
I dropped the ill pace, said junior
Steve Kaplan. This years immense 
success has been a bit of a surprise 
for the whole team. After losing 
several of their top runners from 
last year, most felt that it would 
take a while to build up to their 
previous strength as a team.
I didnt think it would be pos
sible to be better this year than 
last year, said team coach Dario 
Donatelli. The strength of their 
first-years, the determination, and 
the camaraderie of the team as 
a whole has brought the team to 
a new level. Without your team
mates to back you up, theres only 
a lonely trail and pain, said junior 
Khalil Snell.
Next week the mens cross coun
try team will traveling to New York, 
where the will be competing in the 
Rochester invitational against UAA 
opponents Case and Rochester.
CMU Ultimate teams attain divergent successes
uuui ui r\eeu <g?<6??
Sophomore Michael Rivera lays out during a match between the rookies and veterans of Mr. Yuk
by Christian DAndrea
Junior Staffwriter
Even with successful performances in last 
weeks Ultimate Players Association (UPA) 
Founders Sectional Tournament, the mens and 
womens Ultimate Frisbee teams at Carnegie 
Mellon seem to be heading in different direc
tions. While the mens squad, Mr. Yuk, appears 
to have its strongest team in years, the womens 
side, formerly Pansy, now known as Little Miss 
Naughty, will be entering its first season as a 
Carnegie Mellon-only entity. Until this year, they 
had teamed with the University of Pittsburgh to 
form one of the regions best female teams, but 
beginning this week they will test the waters as 
a separate club.
The UPA, who governs all ultimate play, 
stepped in this year and told us that Pansy was 
strong enough to be split back into Pitt and
CMU teams. That leaves us with some rebuild
ing to do, said third-year architecture major 
Jenna Kappelt, captain of the womens team. 
Since we lost so many girls to Pitt weve now 
got a very small roster. Our biggest goal right 
now is to recruit new players and get our num
bers and depth back to where they were. Were 
trying to create a foundation for CMU womens 
ultimate for the future, something that would 
be comparable to the mens team.
Despite the loss, Kappelt still feels optimistic 
about her teams chances this year. The good 
thing is that we didnt graduate any girls, so 
weve got a good amount of strong experience 
from our starters, and thats something that 
we can build on. Weve got some great players; 
Acadia Klain and Vanessa Hodge are both tough 
players on offense and defense, and our young 
players are getting better and better. Kathy 
Chung is one of the girls who is a great example 
of that. When she came to the team last year she
had very little experience, and now shes devel
oping into one of our key players.
On the mens side, the Mr. Yuk team has 
high expectations going into this weekends 
tournament at Oberlin College after qualify
ing for regionals last week. The team will add 
a strong core of talented rookies, including 
Junior World Championship Team member 
Tommy Hendrickson, to a squad that gradu
ated only a few key players after a successful
2004 season. Behind the leadership of captains 
Drew Hendrickson and Dean Eberhardt, Mr. 
Yuk looks to be one of the strongest teams in 
their region.
Last week we sent  mostly-rookie lineup to 
Founders, and they reamed Pitts mostly-rookie 
team 13-7, so weve built up a lot of confidence 
in these guys, said junior computer science 
major Kevin McCloskey, one of the senior mem
bers of the club. Weve got a solid group of 
experienced veterans, including a world and 
national champion teaching a large group of 
motivated rookies. Were looking forward to 
getting out of the cluster to play some ultimate. 
Or maybe moving some computers around and 
playing ultimate in the cluster?
His joke might not be that far from the truth. 
One of the biggest concerns for both teams this 
winter will be finding practice space. In the 
past, both Mr. Yuk and Pansy had access to Pitts 
athletic facilities in the winter due to the alli
ance between the schools. However, both teams 
are confined to the Carnegie Mellon campus 
this winter, and they understand that finding 
space to practice will be difficult.
Were going to suffer in the spring because 
we have nowhere to play this winter. All we 
can do is conditioning when its too cold and 
then get outside and throw when it starts to 
get warmer. The best facilities we can find here 
are at Skibo gym, and there just isnt enough 
space for us to accomplish what we need to, 
said Kappelt.

The newly-formed Athletics 
Council will be holding a Chili 
Cook-off on Sunday from 11 am 
to 12:45 pm on the Intramural 
fields.
The Cook-off will precede 
the Homecoming football 
game, in which the Tartans will 
face off against the University 
of Chicago. According to a 
press release from the Athletics 
Council, the goal of the Chili 
Cook-off is to build school 
spirit and raise awareness 
of our Athletes and Student 
Organizations.
The Chili Cook-off will be 
open to all students, both for 
entering the contest as well 
as test-tasting the chili. The 
winner of the competition 
will receive $200, with prizes 
of $150 and $100 for second 
and third place, respectively. 
Those who arent interested 
in entering chili can enter a 
tasting competition by naming 
their top three choices. The 
taste-tester who has chosen 
the same choices the panel of 
judges will also be eligible for 
a prize as well.
According to the Athletics 
Council leader Tom Matta, 
The Athletics Council is hold
ing the event to build school
spirit, let our students show off 
their culinary abilities, and get 
people excited about the suc
cesses of our athletic teams.
In addition to the chili, there 
will be more events to accom
pany the Homecoming fes
tivities. The Athletics Council 
recently received a special 
allocation from the Student 
Senate to distribute 1000 tow
els which read Plaid Power 
to students.
Furthermore, a new stu
dent section will be unveiled 
at Gesling stadium, next to 
the section where the Kiltie 
Band plays. Free T-shirts will 
be given to students who sit 
in this new section. Also, Tshirts will be launched into the 
crowd to get students pumped 
up.
The Athletics Council 
hopes to increase the number 
of students who attend the 
Homecoming football game. 
In addition to prizes for best 
chili, there will also be a prize 
awarded to the organization 
that brings the most support
ers. The winners of this prize 
will be announced at halftime.
Students who wish to enter 
their own chili concoction into 
the competition must contact 
Darbi Roberts at dlrobert@ 
today. Entrants will be expect
ed to supply chili for at least 
100 people.

Todays thrash revival owes a large debt to At The 
Gates, the Swedish band that started the oft-mentioned Gothenburg Sound. Ironically, most of the 
American bands today that are reviving the scene 
on this side of the Atlantic wouldnt be as potent 
if not for ATGs influence. Now, after the eventual 
break-up of the band in 96, came the formation of 
the lethal (and ever-EVOLVing) line-up that is The 
Haunted. With original vocalist Peter Dolving, The 
Haunteds self-titled debut caught the attention of 
European metal aficionados still sobbing over the 
departure of ATG. With breakneck precision previ
ously known only to Slayer, The Haunted frightened 
all with tracks like Three Times and Hate Song. 
Violent in its view of society and its ills, the bleak 
picture painted by Dolvings lyrics fit perfectly with 
the fretwork of Jensen & Co. Sadly, Dolving left af
ter their debut due to frustration with the situation 
with the record label, and Marco Aro of the awe
some Face Down stepped up.
Now, after two albums, Made Me Do It and One Kill 
Wonder, Aro has returned to life in Sweden and the 
beloved Dolving has returned to The Haunted. And 
what a return.
Actually, Dolvings return accompanies a slight de
parture in terms of their sound on rEVOLVEr. As 
the title hints, this is a conscious effort to prog 
ress forward, but fear not. All the anger, the frus
tration, and of course the metal remains intact.

The Haunted includes members Peter Dolving, Per M. 
Jensen, Anders Bjorler, Patrick Jensen, and Jonas Bjorler.

The Haunteds latest album, 
rEVOLVEr, will be released on October 19.
The slower speaking parts are in the vein of Forensick (off the loved debut), but yes, there are 
(gasp) melodies. Yup, but this is no sissy peaceand-love music.
The bleak gets only bleaker with the addition 
of Dolvings dirgy crooning, and it does help 
them to evolve their sound. Perhaps contem
poraries like Entombed or the Hellacopters have 
had an effect on Dolving. Swedish hard rock has 
evolved, so why not The Haunted?
If youre still wary, check out No Compromise 
and 99, then skip to Sabotage, All Against 
All, and Sweet Relief, then skip the intro to 
Burnt to a Shell, then just listen to it all. Trust 
me. This is a worthy follow-up to One Kill Won
der, and the reunion of the decade as far as the 
underground is concerned.
Until next week,

Whats in a name, anyway?
Bands names determine their place in the rock world
Falling a little outside of this paradigm is the rap game, 
where the goal seems to be to select the most ridiculous 
name possible: Puff Daddy, 01 Dirty Bastard, Big Boi, Fat 
Joe, Jadakiss, and Im not even going to get into Crunk. 
Strangely, this has little effect on the bands talent or their 
record sales, two things that are quite uncorrelated in hiphop circles. So, if your musical aspirations tend more to
wards microphone fiend than guitar wizard, no worries.
If youre one of the many college students who has been 
playing in a rock band, has just formed a band, or is even 
considering putting a group together, this column could 
very well change the course of your life as a musician. I 
sincerely urge you to take all the time youre planning to 
spend practicing, writing, arranging, playing gigs, secur
ing studio time, scoring drugs, and meeting groupies and 
apply it instead to a singularly important endeavor for 
your group: picking a cool name for your band. Because, 
as I will show you, the selection of your bands moniker 
not only strongly influences what style of music you will 
play and what kind of fans it will appeal to, but ultimate
ly the limits of the success you can achieve. Listen up.
The first reason why choosing a solid band name is im
portant is that its usually not at all difficult to tell what 
style of music a band plays just by a quick look at their 
name. Examples? Ive got plenty. The garage rock revival 
seemingly requires its participants to have The before 
their plural name: The Strokes, The White Stripes, The 
Hives, and so on. Sadly, The The doesnt exactly fall 
into this category, but you get the idea. If youre listen
ing to a group whose name contains a day of the week 
(Thursday, Taking Back Sunday) or sounds like some
thing your kid sister might title her diary (The Promise 
Ring, Dashboard Confessional), then congratulations  
youre listening to emo! Days of the week are so sensitive
 can months be far behind? There have to be at least 
600 budding emo bands named December at this very 
moment. Hippie bands (sorry, jam bands) need only to 
put some food in their name (Phish, String Cheese Inci
dent, about a million others) to fly their flag. The symbol
ism there is painfully obvious. Heavy metal bands, espe
cially the overtly morbid black or death metal subgenres, 
are by far the most easily identifiable  check out my 
colleague Albert Cohens work if you dont believe me.
doesnt govern bands whose music is so stunningly 
groundbreaking that it breaks all boundaries of genre 
and is its own entity, but of course thats pretty much im
possible. The real key for you, the aspiring band-namer, 
is to strike a balance between staying conventional, be
ing original, and  most importantly  sounding cool.
Look at the bands who have truly defined rock n roll 
music over the past few decades, omitting those who 
have done so as solo artists (pseudonyms are boring), 
and youll see that they all have stellar names. The 
groups of the British Invasion: The Rolling Stones, The 
Beatles, The Who. The bands who defined heavy metal: 
Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Metallica. The grunge all
stars: Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam. These are all 
excellent names, and Im sure I could list a ton more. 
The point is, if you really want to make your mark, you 
simply have to have a cool name. On the flip side are 
bands who probably make some pretty impressive re
cords but cant make it anywhere. ...And You Will Know
Us by the Trail of Dead have a seemingly endless supply 
of good reviews and street cred, but a name that impos
ing pretty much puts a 50,000-person cap on their fan 
base. Im sure theyre splendid, however, I think subcon
sciously a crazy moniker makes me look the other way.
So, future rock stars, your choice is clear: If you want 
to just have some fun, make some music, and meet easy 
women, then you probably didnt need to read this. But 
if you have visions of grandeur, heed my advice and put 
some serious thought into your name. It would be sad if 
you didnt make it big just because you gave yourself a 
name you and your friends thought was funny when you 
were drunk (it happens). Now, if youll excuse me, Im off 
to practice with my band, Soft Rock. We play hardcore.

Getting back to rock, the point of this little exercise is 
that youre going to have to give away a bit of your set

You cant just name yourself Satans Temple and come 
out strumming thoughtful, acoustic numbers about life, 
love, and your feelings. Theres definitely an unwritten 
pact between you and the fans, and youre going no
where if you dont at least try to stick within some es
tablished band-naming guidelines. This rule, of course,

Taking Back Sunday may look hardcore here, but the use of day of week in their name lets everyone know they are emo.

_on stage.________________
Purnell mainstage begins with Stoppards Arcadia
Blossoms in second act, but steady acting and stage directing throughout
Take notice how many people do a double take when 
they are told that Arcadia, Carnegie Mellons latest pro
duction at the Phillip Chosky Theater, is a play about 
love, sex, and chaos theory. Tom Stoppards award-winning 1993 piece mixes influences far and wide to weave a 
compelling and wholly original tale that stretches across 
two hundred years and two full sets of characters.
The central foci of Arcadia are twofold. One plot line 
follows young prodigy Thomasina Coverly, played by 
drama senior Kat Mandeville, and her womanizing 
tutor Septimus Hodge, played by drama senior Stephen 
Schellhardt. The play follows the two as they deal with 
an uproar in 1809 at Sydney Gardens, their estate. 
Septimus is accused of engaging in carnal embrace 
with the wife of household guest and struggling poet 
Ezra Chater, played by drama senior Will Reynolds. This 
struggle parallels the overhaul of the estates famous 
garden, which gives Lady Croom, played by drama 
senior Kylee Rousselot, fits as she argues against the 
charges.
The other plot arc takes place in 1993 at the same loca
tion, which has been abandoned and being combed 
through by historians and archaeologists. Drama senior 
Claudia Duran plays Hannah Jarvis, a researcher work
ing on a paper about the enigmatic hermit who inhab
ited a small shack on the estate. When her old critic 
Bernard Nightingale, played by drama senior Chuck 
Hittinger, arrives at the estate to investigate some inter
esting connections of the family to the famous poet 
Lord Byron, the insults fly even as the two realize their 
investigations are intertwined.
It is very surprising that an entire play can essentially

the meaning of life through thermodynamics.
focus on chaos theory. Young Thomasina sees the 
science behind heat transfer and entropy and cant 
explain the math; in the present, Valentine Coverly is 
looking at population curves for grouse and trying to 
derive an equation. The interesting part of Arcadia is 
that everything converges and interrelates between the 
two time periods. Valentine ends up using Thomasinas 
numbers to solve his population query. Even some of 
the minutest details tie into the theme; the gardener 
Richard Noakes, drama senior Andrew Gehling, uses an 
advanced steam engine to help landscape the estate 
in 1809, which then inspires Thomasina to develop her 
heat transfer diagrams.
Therein lies the genius of Tom Stoppards writing. He ties 
everything together with a sense of fleeting logic; many 
times during the play you get the feeling that if you dont 
pay attention, youll be lost later on. Everything has its 
perceived importance and its ties to the unexpected. The 
unpredictable and the predetermined unfold together to 
make everything the way it is, Valentine explained in 
the first act of the play. Just like his population data and 
Thomasinas numbers, Arcadia takes the same themes 
and recurses them from the simplest peripheral detail all 
the way up to the play itself  and it is an amazing feat to 
have it actually make sense on that many levels.
That is not to say, of course, that Arcadia is dry and sci
entific. Much of the plays appeal comes from Stoppards 
excellent use of humor. Arcadia is about sex as much as it is 
about chaos theory, and this lets Stoppard work in enough 
humor to draw in even the shortest-attention-spanned 
crowds. Bawdy humor and sarcastic wit share equal foot
ing, with each time period having its own blend of the 
two. An extended joke between Thomasina and Septimus 
about the definition of carnal embrace recurs through
out the first act, while the present day scenes spark with 
the vitriolic bickering between Jarvis and Nightingale.
Schellhardts Hodge steals the show. Less than ten 
minutes into the first scene, he is accused of having sex 
with a married woman and spends the rest of the play 
defending himself from the insulted husband. The 
only thing Hodge really seems to take seriously is math 
and science  and because of that, he has a special 
bond with Thomasina. To everyone else, however, he 
is simply a cocky smartass who has no respect for other 
people and lives in his own little world of numbers. But 
he is fun to watch as he dodges accusations and spins 
peoples words back on themselves, all with a sense of 
smug self-satisfaction.
Thomasina Coverly looks up to Hodge with a sense of 
admiration that, as the play goes on, becomes more of 
a childhood crush. Kat Mandeville plays Thomasina,

discovery.
easily one of the most intriguing characters in Arcadia, 
with ajnuted naivete that brings a realistic edge to the 
character. Sure, she is incredibly gifted in math and 
science, but she is still a little girl, and this is evident 
throughout the play. She discusses the nature of entro
py by using rice pudding and jam as an example. She is 
often shushed by her elders and pouts when she doesnt 
get her way. Mandeville gives the character an almost 
insatiable curiosity  Thomasina is always thinking, 
and always asking questions. Mandeville brings life to a 
unique character and does it very well.
It would be difficult to find a play that encompasses as 
many different thematic elements as Arcadia. Chaos 
theory, unrequited love, sex, gardening, Fermats Last 
Theorem, thermodynamics, determinism, iterated algo
rithms, and more all tie together to create a truly 
intriguing tale that has something to grab everyones 
attention  a great choice for a school like Carnegie 
Mellon.
Arcadia runs through Saturday in the Purnell Center.

Abay Ethiopian Cuisine
Traditional style with real substance
Kelly Duncan/Photo Staff
Chef Sergut Adgeh (left) and Abays owner, James Wallace, sit at the front window around a traditional Ethiopian-style meal. Food is eaten 
communally, and silverware is discouraged.
It has been a struggle, but Pittsburgh finally has an Ethio
pian restaurant. Abay Ethiopian Cuisine opened its doors 
on June 8 and has grown in leaps and bounds since then. 
The restaurant, whose name means Blue Nile in Amharic, the national language of Ethiopia, is the creation 
of former lawyer James W. Wallace. James claims that 
he had been thinking of the idea for a while and a trip 
to Africa prompted him to finally open the restaurant.
Abay has a muted Ethiopian-inspired decor. The walls 
are sand colored and dotted with various small objets 
dart to give the restaurant a calm, casual dining atmo
sphere. If possible, try to eat at the front table by the win
dow, which clearly has the best seats in the house. At 
these seats, diners sit on small backless African stools 
around a low straw table. Abays location, while it may 
ceem out of the way for most CMU students, is actu
ally ideal. It is positioned at the border between East 
Liberty and Shadyside (the 500 bus takes you there). 
Most importandy, Abay is right around the corner from 
the perpetually hip music and performance venue, 
the Shadow Lounge. It is not uncommon to see people 
moving back and forth between one and the other.
My group of five got lucky: On the night we chose to go 
to Abay the restaurant wasnt packed to its maximum ca
pacity. When seated, our waitress, a friendly CMU drama 
student, gave us a quick summary of eating Ethiopian 
style. For the uninitiated, Ethiopian food can only be eat
en communally, and with the hands. Abay does supply
silverware and individual plates on request, but their use 
is highly discouraged. As my relatives used to put it: eat
ing food with a fork is like making love through a sheet
 you just dont enjoy it as much. The food is served on a 
giant platter on a bed of the famous Ethiopian bread, injera. Injera is thin bread with the thickness of a crepe and 
made of fermented wheat. Its spongy texture is perfect for 
soaking up sauce and scooping up morsels of food, mak
ing it a replacement for utensils. The injera at Abay may 
not be made in house but it certainly is fresh. Owner Wal
lace admitted that due to the lack of Ethiopian food stores 
in Pittsburgh and the surrounding area, he gets his bread 
shipped in from Washington, D.C., on Greyhound daily.
Abay is a BYOB establishment but if there is anything 
besides alcohol that can lower peoples inhibitions 
while dining, it is communal eating. Everyone is free 
to sample everything and to be a little messy. Abay 
strongly encourages sampling and sharing by offer
ing reasonably priced combination platters. Reflecting 
on the half-vegetarian menu, the combination plat
ters can be composed of meat dishes, vegetable dishes, 
and, of course, a combination. You are allowed to pick 
four entrees and they come in sizes from one person 
to four people. Aside from allowing you to check out 
many different dishes, the combo platters are also very 
affordable at less than $40 for a four-person platter.
My group was very hungry, and started out with the 
sambussa appetizer. Sambussa is the Ethiopian equiva
lent of the samosa or the spring roll: a small puff pas
try triangle with spiced filling. The vegetarian sam
bussa was filled with spiced lentils and onions. The 
quality seems to fluctuate, as on an earlier trip to Abay 
the sambussa was crisp and moist whereas this time 
the outer shell was soft and the inner filling was ex
tremely dry, requiring sips of water between bites.
For an entree I shared a combination platter, choosing 
the veggie dishes of misr wat, shiro wat, kik alitcha, and 
yeabesha gomen. Wat is an Ethiopian spice blend includ
ing ground cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon and used 
on beef, chicken (such as the definitive chicken dish, 
doro wat), and vegetables. The misr and shiro wat were 
red lentils and yellow lentils, respectively, cooked in a 
wat sauce. All of the dishes that used lentils or wat were 
outstanding. Both lentil dishes were spicy without being 
the least bit too hot and richly flavored to saturate them 
with uniquely Ethiopian flavor combinations of berbere 
spices and onion. The kik atlicha, yellow lentils sim
mered in a lighter combination of spices, was a milder 
dish but equally tasty. The pure vegetable dishes on the 
menu such as the fosoila, spiced green beans and pota
toes, and the yeabesha gomen (the stewed kale that we 
ordered) seemed bland and unremarkable compared to 
the more flavorful hearty lentil dishes. Not surprisingly, 
it was the last item on the combo platter to be eaten.
Abays dessert specials were sorbet, ice cream, and baljlava. My group went for all three, choosing the coconut sor
bet and the coconut fudge ice cream. Abay also features 
spiced coffee and spiced tea (yekemen shai). Opinions on 
the desserts varied as some of my companions really loved 
them and others found them good but not noteworthy.
As described by the owner, customers at Abay fall into 
three categories: There are the natives, people who know 
and love Ethiopian food from living in other cities; there 
are the customers who have heard about Ethiopian food 
but never tried it; and there are those who dont know 
where Ethiopia is, but are hungry for something new. 
Whichever category you identify with, your needs are 
sure to be met by Abays hearty communal fare. Abay 
takes something like Ethiopian food, which can be intim
idating to first-time eaters, and serves in an uncomplicat
ed but still delicious way. Roll up your sleeves and enjoy.

The Titanic all over again
A theater show by the Titanicks
The locals got cozy in the darkness of late Friday night 
in their blue nylon fold-up chairs and plaid woolen blan
kets. A second group watched from behind the barge in 
a Gateway Clippership slowly drifting on the water. The 
closeness of bodies and the lateness of the night lulled 
the audience as they waited for the performance to start. 
They were shaken awake by the long tones of the didgeridoo, indicating boat horns, that kicked off the start of the 
performance.

ly blinding lights flipped on. An odd little old-fashioned 
European motor car zipped on-stage carrying a buxom 
and curvy lady. A parade was implied as big band music 
started up and the crew members were wheeled around 
on ladders, waving to the audience.
The lady, part of a duo that made up the pair represent
ing the Titanics rich passengers, was in turn paraded 
around with her husband as they also smiled and waved 
to the audience. She was offered a bouquet which she 
promptly threw into the audience as a parting gift. Af
ter she smashed an ice block against the ships side, they 
departed. They left in a melee of fireworks  sprays of 
white sparks and colored flares shot up into the night sky 
to finish off the grand goodbye.
Pittsburghers, college students, teenagers, children, and 
dogs all huddled together en masse on Friday night on 
the sloped lawn of the North Shore Riverside Park to 
await the opening night of Theatre Titanicks production 
of Titanic. This hour-and-a-half-long dramatic rendi
tion of the famous tragedy creates a play of the natural 
elements as fires burn in the midst of torrential outpour
ings of water.
Straight from Germany, the Theatre Titanick open-air 
acting troupe hails from Mnster and Leipzig. They are 
internationally renowned for their outlandish and unique 
storytelling of the Titanic, their use of cabaret-style costumes, and their incorporation of strange, silent humor 
in their version.
Theatre Titanicks performance on Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday are a part of Pittsburghs Festival of Firsts, spon
sored by Carnegie Mellon Universitys School of Drama 
and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Three of the master 
performers have given lectures at the School of Drama 
featuring talks on set design, acting techniques, and the 
history of their group.
This is the first time the group is performing in the United 
States. Their arrival is part of Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts 
initiative to bring to Pittsburgh international artists who 
have never showcased their work in the U.S. and to create 
a cultural hub in this old steel town. This is also the first 
time that Theatre Titanick will perform on the water. A 
special stage was created for the performances, floating 
on a barge in the Allegheny River.
The audiences curiosity was stirred as torches were 
brought out to light oil drum fires on stage. The actors 
started banging and clanging, reminiscent of Broadways 
Stomp. The first structure erected was the ships main 
steam pipe  a huge yellow-and-black barrel that was 
raised 60 feet into the air.
French exclamations were exchanged as the ships flam
boyant chef and other crew members loaded up the mov
ing kitchen into the yet-to-be-assembled boat. The 
eight actors ran around getting things ready to cast off 
to the tune of ear-splitting chords from the French horn 
and didgeridoo. Bright lights came on around the stage 
as more frames of the boat were erected using ropes and 
wheeled ladders. The assembly of the boat was part of the 
artistic performance  it was hopeful and lighthearted. 
The spinning stage sets were professionally planned and 
worthy of Broadway.
Simple pieces of the boat puzzle were rolled, pulled, 
lifted, and flung in poetic harmony on stage. To the live 
soundtrack of a three-piece band, the slow pace of wouldbe boring assembly built up anticipation in the viewers 
minds. The bow was finally fitted into place, and suddenCtppolgh 11 msiloRE 2004.

---------------------------------------------------

Water sprayed from the bow indicating the quick pace 
of the ship gliding across the Atlantic. Then the ship hit 
the iceberg. The captain cried out, warning of the colli
sion but none of the crew or passengers seemed to mind. 
Ominous creaks of metal were heard before the first leak 
appeared. The mechanic, a gimpy old man with a crutch, 
went to check on the technical difficulties, and tried futilely to stop the massive leaks himself.
Life went on for the other people on board, as they washed 
up and pulled out a white tablecloth to wine and dine the 
paying passengers. Giant metal funnels were offered to 
the diners and wine was poured into their throats. Play
ing along with the theme was the roasted pig, lavishly 
brought from the kitchen on a skewer, garnished with 
whole vegetables. The four-foot-long pink papier-mache 
pig was placed in front of the guests and promptly carved, 
starting with the vegetables. The diners ate ravenously
and food flew everywhere, including into the audience, 
to everyones delight.
Meanwhile the lame mechanic continued to bail water 
alone in the hull section of the stage while water sprayed 
and poured onto the stage. He shouted warning of an ice
berg to the captain and to the others, but they remained 
unperturbed and continued to revel in their evening fes
tivities.
More fireworks, dancing, and gallivanting ensued in the 
midst of danger. More leaks sprung up and the water was

__on the cover.__________Sustainable Students seeks continued success
A new student organization seeks to change the way environmentalism is practiced
Ann Wootton thinks that students have a great deal of 
power. She wants to do something about it. So do Isa
bella Cederquist and Diane Loviglio. Together, they are 
the three co-leaders of Sustainable Students, one of the 
newest student organizations on campus. Organizations 
come and organizations go, but few have had the imme
diate success of Sustainable Students.
Sustainable Students is an environmental-project-based 
organization. According to Wootton, Sustainable Stu
dents is a group of students who want to take on big 
projects and get them done. One of the reasons that the 
organization has caught the attention of so many people 
is that it came into being when there was already anoth
er vibrant environmental group on campus, EARTH.
Interestingly enough, Sustainable Students origins date 
back to an EARTH meeting from three years ago. A small 
group of students met to discuss the construction of a 
green roof for Hamerschlag Hall. Green roofs are living 
systems that use soil and vegetation to reduce energy 
costs and improve water management.
These discussions led a group of students to pursue a 
SURG grant. Among these students was Loviglio, then 
a freshman in BHA. She began to recruit her fellow firstyear BHA students to join the project, including Woot
ton. For the remainder of the year, this working group 
of students began to research the logistics of installing 
a green roof.
Throughout the following year, a small group of students 
continued to meet. Friends of theirs would join the proj
ect, but it still didnt have a name or a formal structure. 
Without this organizational structure in place, the group 
pursued issues that interested the members. Individuals 
focused on studying the types of birds that would fre
quent a green roof, or the types of sculptures that could 
be places in the gardens. As Wootton put it, We got lost 
on the way.
While these students may not have been focused, they 
were beginning to receive some support from various 
members of the community. According to Wootton, A 
few people in FMS [Facilities Management Services] 
were behind us and very supportive. Others didnt buy 
it. The group applied for, and received, an additional 
SURG grant to continue their study. Furthermore, they 
won an award at Meeting of the Minds for their interdis
ciplinary work.
After two years, the group had worked a great deal with
out making any major progress getting the green roof. 
Through two SURG grants and an award, the group was 
being recognized for what they were trying to do. At the 
same time, there had been no progress in the actual pro
Cederquist joined Sustainable Students at the beginning 
of her first year, when it had just become a formal or
ganization. The group was pleased with the progress it 
was making on the green roof, but as Cederquist put it, 
We wanted some way we could reach students so they 
could go home and get involved. The green roof proj
ect was a way for a small group of dedicated students to 
get involved, but Sustainable Students wanted to reach 
a larger audience.
The group filmed a two-and-a-half-minute short, focus
ing on recycling, that will be screened before AB films 
this semester. Cederquist hopes that the film will pro
vide a humorous approach to informing students about 
the variety of options they have available to them and 
the best ways they can recycle their products.
Both Wootton and Loviglio studied abroad last semester, 
leaving Cederquist and her roommate, third-year histo
ry major Anusha Balasubramanian, in charge of Sustain
able Students. (Balasubramanian is currently studying 
abroad.) Despite a change in leadership only one semes
ter after its foundation, Sustainable Students managed 
to grow throughout the year, with an increasing number 
of students attending the organizations meetings. With 
Wootton and Loviglio returning this semester, the group 
looked to continue to grow.
At the start of this semester, the group had already acx 
complished a great deal. They produced a high-quality 
short film on a small budget, had pursued a three-year 
plan to create a green roof on campus, had created two 
gardens on campus, and had received the funding and 
support necessary to make it a reality. The group had 
grown to include over 25 dedicated members who regu
larly work on projects, and 50 more who contribute to 
varying degrees throughout the semester.
Sustainable Students decided to continue this success by 
focusing on three separate projects. Each group would 
have a project leader and all would meet independently 
from the others. Sustainable Students has transformed 
from a small group of students working together towards 
a common goal into a streamlined organization that op
erates much more like a business than like a traditional 
environmental group.
Loviglio is heading up the first of these projects, which 
focuses on composting. Composting is a process in which 
individuals take food waste, such as banana peels and 
uncooked food leftovers, and place them into a large 
bin. After time, the food is transformed into a type of 
dirt, known as humus, which is ideal for many garden
ing uses.
Loviglio wants this process to be practiced campus-wide:
cess of creating the roof.
It was at this point that the students decided that the 
only way to actually make the green roof a reality was to 
become a formal organization. Sustainable Students was 
born and the green roof project solidified. Since then, 
the organization has received over $100,000 in grants 
to build the green roof. According to Loviglio, Its been 
very successful; its happening in the spring [of 2005].
At the same time that the green roof was becoming a 
reality, the founders recognized that this organization 
could be used to foster other long-term projects that 
focused on similar goals. One of the first projects the 
group undertook parallel to the green roof was a series 
of public service announcements.

Our goal is to get composting in all residence dorms. 
Her project group has planned meetings with Housefellows, Residential Advisors, and Community Advisors to 
discuss the plan. In addition to purchasing and placing 
these bins around dorms, the group hopes to work with 
students in these dorms to explain why composting is 
a better alternative than throwing away food and what 
types of organic waste makes the best compost (hint: 
dont use animal products).
The second project is headed by Cederquist. Her group 
is focusing on providing more local and organic foods 
to students on campus. For the upcoming International 
Festival, Sustainable Students has arranged for lunch 
foods to be brought by local farmers who grow organic 
produce. Dining Services chefs will cook a meal for 
students using these ingredients. According to Ceder
quist, this local foods lunch is a part of a larger goal of 
bringing local and organic foods into the campus dining 
system.
The third project, headed by Wootton, focuses on an 
off-campus issue. Wootton is trying to organize stu
dents to oppose a planned development for the Hays 
Hillside, a 365-acre plot on the Monongahela, across 
from Hazelwood. According to Wootton, a developer 
has purchased the land and plans to mine it for coal, 
level the remains, and build a racecino, a combina
tion racetrack and casino. Wootton sees these plans as 
unacceptable for a number of reasons. She feels that 
we will be affected by having^an urban coal mine, that 
pollution will hit us. Furthermore, there is a fear that 
the developer, Charles Betters, has a bad track record. 
As Wootton puts it, He did something similar in Al
toona, proposed a very similar plan, and then walked 
away and screwed the city. Sustainable Students is try
ing to get members of the Carnegie Mellon community 
to lobby City Hall to oppose this project by denying it 
the environmental permits it needs to continue.

Originally a small group of friends with common interests, Sustainable Students has flourished into a large and efficient organization with 
high hopes for success in the coming years. Pictured are the three founders, Isabella Cederquist, Dianne Loviglio, and Ann Wootton.
Sustainable Students has been transformed from a 
small group of friends to a streamlined organization 
that is capable of accomplishing many different tasks at 
the same time. Yet its rise has come in the context of a 
complicated relationship to the campus other environ
mental group, EARTH. When asked, all three co-leaders 
had something similar to say about EARTH. Wootton 
puts it this way: Our understanding of EARTH is that 
it is much more focused on the education of environ
mental values, whereas we are focused on action, we 
are focused on projects.
Is it possible that a new group could spring up without 
any competition? According to the president of EARTH, 
Ryan England, yes. We dont have one focus, we are 
generally environmentally focused. We do a little bit of 
activism, but not too much. Sustainable Students has 
given more energy to the activities we do.
EARTH is an old organization, so old that nobody actu
ally remembers when it was founded. England and oth
ers feel that the rise of Sustainable Students is a positive 
development in a struggle they share.
Interestingly enough, none of the three leaders of Sus
tainable Students or the president of EARTH have been 
to each others meetings all year. There is some discus
sion on working together, but currently, the two groups 
have only held events with a social focus. While it may 
be possible to have an environmental group focused 
on activism and another focused on education, there 
is bound to be some overlap and some contested areas. 
Both groups remain dedicated to working together in 
the near future, they have planned a series of environ
mental organic dinners together, the next one being this 
Wednesday at 7 pm in New House. The dinners are free 
of cost and open to everyone. Yet whether or not there 
can be a lasting balance between the groups will be left 
up to the future leaders of both organizations.

The Maria Chronicles
Production explores Hispanic culture from the bottom up
West Side Story lied! Columbus would never have dis
covered America without a Latina! These statements 
and many others adorned the McConomy blackboard be
hind Wednesday nights The Maria Chronicles. Teatro 
Luna, a cast of six young Latin-American women, let their 
audience step into the life of a Latina in entertainment. 
From pants that will not fit, to trying to act more spicy, 
the series of 17 short scenes hilariously explored the ste
reotypes and prejudices that Hispanic actresses must face 
when trying to make it in the industry.
Teatro Luna was created in Chicago in 2000 by Coya Paz 
and Tanya Saracho, both performing members of the cast 
and directors of the play. They, along with the rest of the 
ensemble, Nilsa Reyna, Marisabel Suarez, and Diane Her
rera, wrote, created, choreographed, and adapted every 
scene from their own life stories.
Hispanic Heritage Month has brought a slew of cultural 
events to our campus, but none have been so entertaining 
as The Maria Chronicles. Salsa classes and craft work
shops have nothing on the witty banter of the Chroni
cles cast.
After an introductory explanation that truth is stranger 
than fiction when youre a Latina auditioning in Chica
go, the first scene began by breaking down stereotypes 
in entertainment.
Two cast members played casting directors auditioning 
Latinas for High School Undercover, during which they 
asked the auditionees to act tough or more Hill Dis
trict and less Shadyside. Several of the scenes were set 
up like this, where the casting directors asked for more 
stereotypical, generic Latinas with a stronger accent so 
that they could play the exotic friend of the star or the 
quiet, sexy maid. One girl had to get down and show her 
floor-scrubbing technique.
The official statement on Jennifer Lopez had the audi
ence cracking up. One side of the stage supported Lopez 
as a role model while the other made fun of her volup
tuous curves. They even went so far as to draw her most 
famous asset on the board and cross it out, much to the 
audiences delight.
This led into several longer scenes about the infamous 
Hispanic curves. One scene, titled Piece of Ass, had the 
actresses dancing facing opposite of the audience to give 
them the best view possible. Then there was a booty 
workout in which audience members joined the cast to 
learn moves to increase their gluteus maximus. Then the
cast staged a mock protest where they carried signs pro
claiming, Nalgonas Unidas, Down with Crack, Up with 
Butts, and Big Butts Unite!
Next, one member of mixed ethnicity performed a mono
logue about her pelo malo, which prevented her from 
identifying with other Puerto Ricans. Her Africana hair 
refused to straighten and prevented her from obtaining 
Latina roles. The casting directors suggested she wear 
comrows. As one of the more serious scenes, it provoked 
more sympathy from the audience then the usual com
edy.
The play ended with a scene similar to the one which be
gan it, a breakdown of a Latina character, but this time 
there were no stereotypes. Each actress described her
self as an individual and not just as a Latina. By expos
ing the preconceived notions and prejudices of the acting 
community, they hoped to affect the larger world where 
young Hispanic women only look to movies and the me
dia for role models.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You will reach an impasse in your inter
nal identity struggle when torn between your love of vintage polyester, 
free from your grandmas closet, and your longing for prohibitively 
>. expensive but enticingly breathable organic cotton knits.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Walking in Oakland tomorrow, you will 
see a person you recognize from afar and spend the next two minutes, 
until your paths cross, desperately trying to remember how you know each other. You 
will finally decide a neutral nod is appropriate, only to realize that apparently the person 
does not recognize you anyway.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): The sooner you come to terms with your science fiction 
and romance novel preferences, the faster you and your librarian can form a warm, 
trusting relationship.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): That letter your friend" is planning to send to your favor
ite sexual advice columnist may contain a few too many personal details. I urge your 
friend" to rewrite that letter to eliminate well-known names, nicknames, street names, 
- and publicly witnessed events to avoid the extreme prolonged social awkwardness that 
will surely ensue following its publication.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Your lack of natural bingo skill will enable you to become a 
valued donor to the Pittsburgh religious center of your choice, in addition to giving you 
an excuse to let loose and go wild every Monday and Thursday night at 7:30.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): After finally starting on that month-old pile of 
dishes in your kitchen sink, you will discover a brightly speckled amphibian thought to 
have been extinct for 52 years. Twenty minutes later, after having notified the authori
ties, you will realize that in the right light, the remains of a Salisbury steak TV dinner 
can look like just about anything.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Your life may seem depressing now, but look 
closer and you will see a faint glimmer of happiness and hope. If you cannot see this, 
you should see an ophthalmologist immediately, and it will probably be incredibly 
 expensive.

SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Focus on small goals like waking up, brushing 
your teeth, and turning on your computer, and you will at least be closer to finishing 
that essay than you would be just staring dejectedly at your blank walls, quaking in fear 
of foreign threats like bibliographies, footnotes, and actually having a point to com
municate.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): A small meteor will crash down from the 
heavens and whack you in the head, causing you to trip, slip and slide down the steep, 
rain-slicked Negley hill at record-breaking speeds, amidst the crowd attracted by your 
wild howls and, you know, the flaming meteor.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Free food from catered campus lectures may 
tide you over for a while, but no one can subsist on just cookies and bottled water no 
matter how much they can cram into their backpack at a time.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You will suddenly find yourself transported into 
a superhero comic, where you will be unable to stand up due to your creatively depicted 
body proportions and begin to feel uncomfortable pinned to the ground by gravity in your 
spandex tube top and patent leather thigh-high boots.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You will call out to your friend John on the street 
tomorrow, only to realize three seconds later that it is just some guy who looks like John 
from the back. No one on the street will buy your pretending to wave to someone far 
away. They will turn around and stare at you trying to be smooth about it.

Fernando began preparing the poisoned feast for his arch
nemesis Rogelio. He decided to invite the object of his (and 
Rogelios) affection, Maria, as well. He knew that Maria 
would never eat such a barbarous food as foie gras, so she 
would be safe from the poison. Rogelio, on the other hand, 
would let his ostentatious palette get the better of him and 
scarf down the rare delicacy  and the poison! He figured 
nothing would repel Maria from Rogelio more than seeing 
him keel over at the dinner table. Maria would once again have eyes for Fernando alone. 
Once the feast was ready, Fernando went to find his dinner guests. He found them sitting 
under a tree at the edge of the pond. Seeing them together only fueled Fernandos rage 
 and his eagerness to poison Rogelio!

Chris Ware: Graphic Poetry
Two years ago the Regina Gouger Miller gallery dis
played a few original pages from Chris Wares landmark 
ndebut graphic novel, Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid 
" On Earth, here on campus as part of the Comic Relief 
show. I felt that most of the show was a travesty, dredg
ing up the worst pieces by gallery artists stealing blindly 
from a century of comics without mustering the dignity 
to even acknowledge their own lack of ingenuity. The 
Jimmy Corrigan page, however, was a tasty treat. Wares 
work has also appeared in several gallery shows across 
the country, following its successful show of his comics 
at the Whitney. Amongst art snobs who chitchat about 
hip, underground comix, Chris Ware has become 
pretty chic. The newest buzz is over his most recent 
independent comics collection, McSweeneys Quarterly 
*Concern. I think its all really good too, which is pretty 
surprising because my comic taste rarely intersects with 
that of art snobs.
At the time that Chris Ware first became widely read, the 
two best springboards for new independent artists were 
World War III and Raw. Cartoonist Seth Tobocman, who 
spoke on this very campus not two weeks ago, heads 
World War III. Art Spiegelman, the prolific creator 
of the graphic novel Maus, started Raw. Spiegelman 
invited Chris Ware to contribute to Raw. His comics 
caught the eye of Gary Gross from Fantagraphics, who 
then offered him his own series. Acme Novelty Library 
ran in the early 90s, and Jimmy Corrigan collected the 
later issues from this series.
Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth tells the 
story of Jimmy Corrigan, a 36-year-old emotionally 
impaired human castaway, who receives a letter from 
his deadbeat father he has never met. This simple prem
ise hermeneutically accesses a four-generation history 
of imagination, alienation, and defeat in the phlegmatic 
Corrigan family.
Jimmys personality is perplexing. In his rich fantasy 
life he demonstrates a grasp of human interaction, but 
in real life his autism leaves those around him with 
the impression that he isnt a capable adult. His father, 
on the other hand, appears simple to understand. His 
abandonment of Jimmys mother, his ignorant views, 
and his ego-driven lack of empathy paint him as simply 
a bastard. His awkward attempts to reach out to Jimmy, 
however, and his successful relationship with his adopt
ed black daughter would seem to indicate otherwise. 
His grandfather, as Jimmy meets him, is an apathetic 
old man, but flashbacks to the past reveal several paral
lels between the characters that are obstructed by age 
and circumstance.
Wares art is geometric, stylized, and reminiscent of 
golden-age newspaper cartoons. Even more interest
ing, however, is his poetic application of motifs and 
symbols, revealing layers of unspoken meaning to the 
story. These elements are emphasized in scenes that 
completely omit narration and dialogue, and 
contain subtle, beautiful moment-to-moment 
transitions. The expressive potential of shape, 
color, balance, and space are tapped along a 
vein that is accessible only in the medium of 
comics. In other sections his style adopts a sad 
sense of humor; he leaves the physical world 
altogether to make cut-and-fold puzzles out 
of the more tragic elements of the story.
The most important motif is Chicagos Worlds 
Colombian Exposition of 1893, which acts as 
both a backdrop and a living environment to 
the childhood of Jimmy Corrigans grand
father. More prominent aspects of the fair, 
such as peaches and birds, recur in the mute 
scenes from the present day. These references 
create subtle poetic links to the past beyond 
the obvious similarity of the characters. The 
fair acts as one of many anchors across the 
country at the dawn of American Modernity, 
a theme that echoes throughout the urban 
environment, alienating Jimmy. All of these 
symbols, past through present, are used to 
describe Jimmys sexual frustration, loneli
ness, and fear of being disliked.
Jimmy Corrigan acts as a link between artistic 
and literary circles. The book garners respect 
for its obvious merit and suffers from none 
of the usual stigmas that plague comics. As 
opposed to the wave of comic artists who try 
to push an agenda of breaking off graphic 
novels from comics as an artistically legiti
mate medium, Wares work is successful sim
ply because it is a comic that appeals across 
cultural boundaries. That kind of multilateral 
interest mirrors the across-the-board inter
est in Charles Schultzs Peanuts from half a 
century ago. Having observed this link, its 
not hard to proceed to draw several parallels 
between the stories and styles of Ware and 
Schultz, especially when one arms oneself
with The Complete Peanuts, which came out this past 
summer from Fantagraphics.
You should all go out and read both. Right now.
