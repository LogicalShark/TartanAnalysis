cently decorated by the Societ Rus
sian government for his work dur
ing the past two years in a steel 
manufacturing district of Siberia, 
according to a letter received last 
week by Dr. 'W. R. Work, head of 
the Department of Electrical En
gineering. Mr. Deesz, as an en
gineer employed by the Soviet 
.government is helping to build a 
power plant which will have a ca
pacity of 208,000 kilowatts with 
135,000 volt transmission when it 
is finished. The power plant, says 
Mr. Deesz, is located in Siberia, 
3200 miles east and 130 miles north 
of Moscow. Tho region is so far away 
from centers of population that 
it is commonly located by latitude 
and longitude. The electrical pro
ject is being constructed to furnish 
power for the iron and steel mills 
which are to be constructed to 
make use of the great iron ore and 
coal deposits of the region.
Greek Letter Men Harbor Mascots 
Of Strange and Unusual Varieties
Order of Fraternal Animals 
Mourn Departed Friend 
At P. K. A. House
By LITITIA LYTELLE
It seems that the Greek-letter 
men of this campus have been har
boring within their respective 
walls, for nigh onto a year or per
haps longer, animals of strange va
rieties and descriptions. Four
legged animals; two-legged ani
mals; animals on wheels; animals 
that swim; animals that fly; do
mestic and wild animals; even 
live and dead animals; all of these 
have been in our midst unbe
knownst to the very classmates of 
the young men with whom these 
fraternity mascots come into 
constant contact.
However, it is not the Gray 
Ghost of the Phi Kapa bungalow, 
or the lovely Adreue of 5017 
Forbes street that we here ele
gize. The famous Kappa Sigma 
house mother, Oswald; the Delta 
Sigma Lambda mascot, and the re
maining members of the affiliated 
order of fraternal animals must 
step aside for the sake of a bit of 
publicity for tlieir dear departed 
sister, Salome, late of the Pi Kap
pa Alpha dwelling on Wiglitman 
street.
Salome began and ended this 
life as a blonde dog of uncertain 
ancestry. Wien still quite a 
"young thing she chanced across 
the path of Mr. Ivannenberg, P. K. 
A., famous for his assorted collec
tion of birds (formerly) of the air, 
beasts of the land, and (gold) fish 
of the sea.
Salome lived a happy, exciting 
life. She was, primarily, fed on 
the best dog-food available. Many 
were the sugared dog biscuits 
which appeared in her dessert. 
Even the brothers thought of 
them as delicacies. Furthermore, 
the young lady slept upon the 
downy surface of a genuine burlap 
sack and did not rise until noon. 
And exercise was afforded her by 
several ordinarily dignified P. K.

Alumnus Devises New 
Chart for Railroads
Robert A. Burrows, a graduate 
of the Works Management Depart
ment in 1929, now a statistician for 
A. E. M,asten and Company, has in
dependently prepared a new rail
road chart showing at a glance the 
inter-relation, consolidation, and 
capitalization of the principal 
American railroads as of January
1, 1933. According to the Financial 
Editor of the Pittsburgh SunTele
graph, Mr. Burrows chart is an un
usual and comprehensive study of 
financial conditions. It contains a 
wealth of information, including 
earnings in the last four years 011 
common, preferred and fixed 
charges; and tabulations of capital 
set-up in percentage, mileage, fund
ed debt per mile, and operating ra
tio.

pearance on tlie campus will be the 
first since last fall when his orches
tra played for the Western Re
serves and W. & J. football dances 
on consecutive Saturdays. Wiexels 
orchestra will be remembered for 
its smooth syncopation, marvelous 
rhythm, and their humorous nov
elties. He has played at numerous 
collegiate events, including the In
diana State College Interfraternity 
Formal, the Slippery Rock State 
Junior Prom, and the Intercollegi
ate Ball on Christmas night at the 
Hotel William Penh. The genial 
leader will lift his baton promptly 
at nine oclock to start the music 
for the couples who do not attend 
the boxing matches.
The occasion of the CarnegieWest Virginia matches will again 
afford the opportunity for formal 
attire, as has been the custom at 
boxing matches. A large group at

CAMPUS PERSONALITIESy
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Total Day School Enrollment 
Expected to Set Second 
Semester Record
Rates Have Been 
Secured for Play
Special student rates of 60c 
for the $1.10 seats have been 
secured for the Friday night 
performance of the new Theater 
Guild play, Both Your Houses," 
by Maxwell Anderson.
The play is a comedy satire 
based on present day politics. 
It deals with a statesman in the 
making, who unfortunately 
takes his ideals to Washington 
with him, to find that they are 
in great danger of being com
pletely lost in the legislative 
mixup. According to Mr. Ken
yon, this is the first time this 
play has ever been presented.
Tickets may be secured by 
placing your order with Mr. 
Kenyon, Room 104, College of 
Fine Arts, as soon as possible.
Up through last Friday 9S unem
ployed graduate Carnegie students 
had taken advantage of the free 
tuition offer by registering in sec
ond semester day school classes at 
Carnegie. It is expected by the 
Registrars office that by next Sat
urday noon, the final date for regis
tration, 130 graduate students will 
have been enrolled. This figure 
according to Mr. Collins, who is in 
charge of the enrollment, is a 
larger one than was anticipated 
when the offer was made.
The distribution of the enroll
ment by colleges is as follows: Col
lege of Engineering, 28; College of 
Industries, 22; College of Fine 
Arts, 32; and Margaret :Morrison 
Carnegie College, 16.
In tlie majority the courses taken 
by the graduate students are those 
related to teachers training. The 
various psychology and teaching 
subjects have the largest enroll
ment.
The graduate registration will in
crease the day school enrollment to 
a figure closely approaching that 
of the first semester and will prob
ably set a new high total for sec
ond semester registration.
The free tuition offer, made ef
fective February 15, is applicable 
to graduate students who have se
cured their Bachelor's Degree at 
Carnegie and who are at present 
unemployed. All such students are

Winifred Wygal 
To Address Two 
Meetings Mar. 9
The Y. W. C. A. will hold its din
ner meeting in the Margaret 
Morrison Recreation Hall on 
Thursday, March 9, rather than 
March 7 as stated last week. At 
this meeting Miss Winifred Wy
gal of the National Y Board will 
speak. In the dinner meetings of 
this year, the Y has had repre
sentatives of various religions 
present their views. Miss Wygal 
will probably choose a related sub
ject on religion for her talk. Any 
girl who is interested is invited to 
attend this meeting.
On March 9, at noon in the Fac
ulty Dining Room in the Inn, M.iss 
Wygal will address a joint lunch
eon meeting of the Freshman and 
Senior Y cabinets. Alice Work, 
president of the Y. W. C. A., urges 
all members of these cabinets to 
be present, for the speaker will 
probably have many valuable sug
gestions concerning the Y and 
its work.
Mr.Archer Will Teach 
Course in Sales 
Distribution
Realizing the very great demand 
for men who are thoroughly train
ed in the fundamentals of the 
salesmanship as well as in their 
particular profession, Carnegie is 
offering a free lecture course in 
the proper psychological approach 
for sales distribution. Former stu
dents may take this work without 
charge; although the lectures se
ries began last Monday evening, 
the course is still open for regis
tration. It will be given every 
Monday evening at 7:30 oclock In 
104 Industries Building.
Mr. Beatty of the Employment 
Bureau recommends the course 
highly, believing that it will prove 
very beneficial to the alumni, 
showing not only the reason for 
the present unemployment, but 
also assisting the alumni in recu
perating from their present status. 
The lecture will aid to train men 
who are forced with the necessity 
of selling or otherwise presenting 
information to the public. It will 
be under the personal direction of 
William C. Archer, past president 
of the Pittsburgh Advertising Club 
and past president of the Sales 
Managers Club of Pittsburgh.
A series of ten meetings will'be 
held, which will include lectures, 
demonstrations and practice on the 
part of the students. The sub
jects will be covered as follows:
1." Four Fundamentals oE Sales
manship.
2. Pre-approach  Knowledge of 
your product.
3. AttentionGetting.
4. Arousing Interest on the part 
of the Prospect.
5. Creation of Desire for your 
Product.
G. ClosingTechnical Products.
7. ClosingNon - Technical Prod
ucts.
8. Call-BacksIncreasing Volume 
from Present Customers.
9. Meeting Competition  Over
coming Objections.
10. Personality  Its Development 
and Importance._____________
Decline of Confidence in Bankers 
May Bring Benefits, Says Dr. Ross
Prof. Charles C. Leeds, Head of 
the Works Management Option of 
the Department of Commercial 
Engineering, and another of the 
men who have been with the Insti
tute since its founding, was. born 
in New Richmond, Ohio, and at
tended public schools in the neigh
boring town of Amelia. During his 
apprenticeship to the machinist 
trade in the Big Four Railroad 
shops he studied at the Ohio 
Mechanics Institute, from which he 
graduated in 1895. When the In
stitute began to give degrees he 
received liis In Mechanical En
gineering in 1913.
As an employee of companies 
in and near Cincinnati Professor 
Leeds received further training as 
a machinist^ designer, and engi
neer. After a time in research 
work under Mr. Skinner at West
inghouse, he came to tlie newly 
founded Carnegie Technical 
Schools in 1905 as Head of the De
partment of Drawing. I11 1912 he 
took charge of the Machine Pro
duction Department, which includ
ed the four shops, and in 1925 -was 
appointed Head of the Department 
of Works Management.
During the early days when Car
negie had no student activities ap
propriation, Professor Leeds aid 
was invaluable in planning to se
cure means for athletic competi
tions. A year after the first field 
(now Forbes Field) had been con
ditioned, its sale for its present 
purpose forced the preparation of 
the Bowl and the necessary rais
ing of funds; to all this work Pro
fessor Leeds gave his whole-heart
ed direction. The Bowl, for a time 
was popularly called Leeds Field.
Professor Leeds has written sev
eral textbooks, and at present is en
gaged in writing another on pro
duction management methods. 
Much of this work he does at his 
summer cottage in the Adirondacks, where he spends his entire 
summer vacations. The fine op
portunity for nature study afforded 
here has led also to a strong in
terest in photography, in which 
connection he has patented an en
largement apparatus. Long ac
quaintance with Adirondacks sec
tion of New York has given him a 
thorough knowledge of its full his
toric background.

Believes Adoption of Sound 
System May Come From 
Present Mistrust
By DR. SAMUEL B. ROSS
Once again we find that confi
dence and trust may be more safe
ly imposed in the church than in 
the counting house.
From the daily accumulation of 
evidence that comes to us it ap 
pears that complete exhaustion of 
confidence in our bankers and our 
present banking system might be a 
great piece of national good luck 
in the long run. This is especially 
true if it should lead to the adop
tion of a sound system.
Let us look at a few of the facts 
in the case of one of our financial 
pilots who has just made a visit 
to the Senatorial inquisition cham
bers. Charles E. Mitchell, veteran 
chairman of the National City 
Bank of New York evaded an in
come tax payment by showing a 
loss of $2,700,000 on a sale to one 
of his family. This is not credita
ble conduct for a man occupying 
his position of public confidence 
and trust.
Although Mr. Mitchell received

Reinforced Floor 
Test Successful
During the month of January a 
new type of reinforced floor con
struction has been tested for abil
ity to withstand pressure by the 
Department of Building Construc
tion in the Masonry Shop. This 
floor was made from two sheets of 
twenty gauge sheet metal between 
which are sheets of metal bent 
lengthwise into a V shape and spot 
whirled together, making a zigzag 
effect.
The floor having an area of 
twenty-one square feet, was test
ed by piling bricks one upon, an
other so that they would not arch. 
When the bricks were piled to the 
point where the floor might buckle 
under the pressure, it was found 
that there was a total of nine thou
sand two hundred and forty 
poynds or four hundred and forty 
pounds per square foot resting on 
the floor.
This type of construction will bo 
advantageous in the building of 
residences or small apartment 
houses where there is need of very 
light construction materials.

Plaid Points for 
Dukes; Grove City 
At Gym Tonight
There will be no rest for Max 
Hannums cage team this week, 
for after returning from their dis
astrous eastern invasion they are 
facing two of the strpngest fives 
in tlie east. Grove City will visit 
the Carnegie Gym Tuesday and 
Duquesne will be on hand Friday 
evening.
In facing the Grovers tonight, 
the Tartans will have more than 
their hands full. Grove City has 
had one close game with Duquesne 
and at the present' time they and 
Geneva are at fighting it out for 
the Tri-State title.
Friday the Plaid will again be 
batHSng against tough odds, al
though overconfidence might possi
bly wreck the Dukes chances. Beydnd all .dispute Duquesne is the 
class of the section this season, 
and their 36-25 defeat of the Skibos earlier in the season seems to 
give good indication of their pow
er. They also have two decisions 
over Pitt under their belts, which 
should make any team feel happy.
Carnegie supporters point out 
last years record with Duquesne 
as an example of how little comparitive scores mean. In the first en
counter, the boys from the Bluff 
gave the Scotch an unmerciful 
drubbing, 29-14, but in the second 
game the tables were reversed and 
the Tartans won handily, 29-24. 
Such a reversal would be greatly 
welcomed this year in view of the 
lean season the sons of Skibo have 
undergone so far.
Coach Hannum will probably 
start the same lineup that lias been 
playing together most of the sea
son. Smith and Jagnow will be at 
the forward posts, Stentz and Bwalt 
will divide the center honors, and 
Fergus and Rigg or Silverman will 
take"care of the back court.
Decline in Confidence

the cancellation in 1930 of $340,- 
000;000 in Mexican bonds and in 
1927 of $127,000,000 in Honduran 
bonds, plus .the billion in other for
eign bonds now in default, the re
sponsibility of bankers for the 
present low ebb of American pur
chasing power becomes more ap
parent.
Looking at the two periods, first' 
the flush days with the purchase 
of worthless paper and the lean 
days when the need is for things 
that can be eaten, it appears that 
investors made a choice of pur
chases that amounts to a prefer
ence for cellulose to sandwiches. 
Yet this was not a conscious pref
erence. Secrecy and misinforma
tion prevented the purchaser from 
understanding the possible out
come. Those with savings acted 
with confidence and as a result a 
goodly portion of the nations pur
chasing power has passed out of 
the hands of those who. would have 
stimulated business by purchasing 
necessities for consumption.
American history shows few in
stances' in which confidence -was so 
fervently asked, so freely given, 
and so little deserved as in the in
vestment decade just ended. Skeptism not confidence is appropriate 
to a banking system that shows a. 
record of over 9,000 failures since 
1921.
If the present decline of confi
dence continues * it may finally 
reach the banking circles and low
er the confidence and morals of the 
bankers themselves. This in turn 
might pave the way for the organ

Urges Progress
BY JOE BRONSON
The Carnegie swimmers, recov
ering quickly from their defeat at 
the hands of Pitt, came through 
with decisive-victories over West
ern Reserve on Friday and Case on 
Saturday in the Tartan pool. In 
the two days, competition five new 
records were made.
The Tech iiatators experienced 
little difficulty in setting back 
Western Reserve with a score of 
44-31. In the course of the meet 
three new records were set. The 
relay team, composed of Franke, 
von der Lancken, La Chance and 
.Miller, negotiated the two hun
dred stretch in 1:44, the fastest 
time ever done by a Carnegie 
team in this event. Boyer splashed 
through the 150-yard backstroke in 
1:50.9 to set a new record for the 
pool. Weinberger, Western Re
serve star, lowered the pool mark 
for the 220 to 2:38.4.
The Tartan . splashers gained 
their second victory Saturday, 
turning back Case School 41-23. In 
this meet three previous marks 
were broken by Tech mermen, Mil
ler and Boyer. In the fifth Miller 
breezed through to an easy victory 
in the record time of 24.5 second. 
He gave another brilliant perform
ance in the hundred by navigating 
the distance in _56. Boyer took 
the 150-yard backstroke easily low
ering his record of the previous day 
to 1:47.2.
The Plaid swimmers will be 
battling around the east this week
end when they meet Franklin -and 
Marshall at Lancaster Friday, and 
New York University at New York 
Saturday.
In a recent meet with Pitt the 
F. & M. swimmers were defeated by 
a narrow margins This would 
seem to indicate a tougher fight 
for the Tartans in the fracas on 
Friday. Our chances for scoring 
another victory looks better with 
New York University whose com
parative swimming times, taken 
from recent meets,  seem to indi
cate a victory for the Tartans on 
Saturday.
To date the Tartans have won 
two and lost one meet and victo
ries in both of the coming engage: ments are necessary to insure a fa
vorable balance in the win colum.
Carnegie's basketballers returned 
home Sunday after a very uncom
fortable week-end in the East with 
little more than the train ride to 
show for their efforts. It just 
wasn't in the books for Fergus, 
Smith & Co. to win, for although 
the Tartans, put up their usual 
scrappy game and at some time in 
each of the three contests seemed 
destined for victory, were never
theless always on the short end of 
Lhe score when the regulation 40 
minutes came to a close.
Carnegie celebrated  Washing
tons Birthday in Madison Square 
Garden and treated the 15,000 spec
tators to a thrilling 35-31 battle. 
New York was on the long end of 
that score, so the Gotham fans 
went home satisfied that their fav
orites had successfully evened a 
score with an old rival.
The Skibos hopped off to an 
early lead which mounted to eight 
points at one stage, but New York 
put on the pressure and lead 19-13 
at the half. The last stanza saw 
the Plaid knot the count at 28 all 
only to fall before a successful 
Violet rally which meant the mar
gin of defeat.
Friday night Maxie Hannums 
Conference hopes received a se
vere jolt when the crack Temple 
outfit pushed our Tartans into third 
place to the tune of 35-32. The 
first half of this important fray 
was slow and rough, with most of 
the scoring being done via the foul 
route. The score at the half time 
was tied at 10 all.
At the start of Lhe final session 
Carnegie jumped to a three-point 
lead, but here Temple suddenly 
came to life and with Rosan, Oudd 
and Liebensperger on the tossing 
end, ran the count up to 27-18 in 
short order. The remainder of the 
game consisted of a series of des
perate though unsuccessful at
tempts on the part of Carnegie to 
cut down the Owls big advantage.
A tired and somewhat discour
aged Tartan busketball squad was 
forced to swallow another bitter 
pill at Mt. Nittany, where Penn 
State completed Carnegies dis
astrous Eastern invasion by squeez
ing out a 30-27 victory. Carnegie 
held an 11-9 advantage at the half 
and were leading 26-22 Avith but a 
few minutes left to play, only to 
see the Lions go out in front and 
carry off the victory.
THERE IS AN OLD SAYING that wo learn something new every day. 
What new bits of information that may have oceped , through our 
brain (don't laugh) on five of the days last week we can't remember, 
but of the other two we not only remember but wo were greatly sur
prised at the Information. The first surprise came, I think on Wed
nesday. On that day I read a notice that appeared in one of the 
daily papers dated and marked as being released in Philadelphia. In 
this article the president of Temple University said that Temple had 
not in the past, and would not in the future grant athletic scholarships. 
Ho said that It was purely sportsmanship and the love of competition 
which brought good athletes to the Philadelphia institution.
Now the statement may be all right in referring to the future, 
but somehow it doesnt click with the present and the past. My dear 
Watson, could you please explain to me how a certain boy from my 
homo town, who was a star athlete in the high school there, could 
matriculate at the Owl Institution with very little money and spend 
four years there without working? Of course ho played on the football 
team but that is beside the question. As Shakespeqre so aptly put 
it in the tragedy of Hamlet: Something is rotten In the state of
Denmark.
Hockey seems to be taking a 
firm hold at Carnegie Tech. A 
few months ago a call was issued 
for all hockey aspirants to appear 
at the Duquesne Garden for a prac
tice and since that time the puck 
chasers have gotten together eacli 
week. The astounding part is that 
these fellows have continued to get 
up at six in the morning to attend 
these sessions. There will be 
practice ' this week at the usual 
hour of 7:00 a. m.
The movement towards starting 
a team lias the hearty support of 
the Athletic Association especially 
Mr. Overend who is a real hockey 
fan. This will not be the first 
hockey team to represent Tech. 
The last time we liad a team ori 
the ice was about 1922. There will 
be no attempt to arrange a sched
ule this year, but with the coming 
of next winter definite action will 
be taken. Pitt and Duquesne also 
found the season too late this year 
but will be all set next year and 
a definite schedule and probably a 
league will be arranged.

IT SEEMED AS IF I HAD NO SOONER READ THIS and thought 
about it and tried to rationalize ray thoughts to agree with those of the 
head of the Temple University when I picked up the following days 
paper and on the same page and in the same column I read, imagine 
my surprise, a similar statement regarding the University of Pitts
burgh. Now please don't regard me as a reformer and a gossip, but 
you seo these things sort of puzzled me and I just wanted to get them 
straight. Now the story said that Pitt had formed a committee which 
would handle all applications for Student aid. And from now on ath
letes would not be discriminated for or against. And by doing this they 
said they would now be able to come under the recommendations of 
the Middle Atlantic Association, or something like that, which at the 
last meeting decided to abolish all athletic scholarships.
Now the statement of Pitts let the administration out all right; 
so next the head of the Athletic Association was interviewed and he 
said that athletic scholarshipsas suchhad not existed for the past 
couple of years and would not exist in the future. That "as such" 
clause is what gets me. Just what is meant? It is similar to the 
"due process clause of the fourteenth amendment which took over 
forty years of judicial revue to finally decide its meaning. Since this 
cannot come under any court case, it may go years before it is defined 
as we poor plebians will have to wait many years until wo finally 
know. But before I let the subject go I would like to ask one ques
tion: If they are not athletic scholarships, what are they called?
Lest anyone should have misinterpreted my ramblings I hope no
one Lhluks that I disagree or do not believe the information given out 
by our neighboring institution. Far be It from me to dubt the word 
of those more learned than I, but I happen to ho of an inquisitive 
nature and thought that some of the readers'should straighten me out. * * *  *
IT SEEMS AS IF the swimmers were the only ones of the Carnegie
athletic teams that were able to hold their heads above water during 
the past week, and even they had their ups and downs, especially the 
divers. But putting all kidding aside it really was a bad week as far 
as victories and defeats go. The natators turned In two victories against 
three defeats for the basketball team and one each for the rifle and 
boxing squads.
Coach Hannum and his boys first journeyed to the great Metropolis 
and after a good night's rest they wandered down to Madison Square 
Gardon to take on the New York University team. The strong violet 
five were a little too powerful In their own back yard and when the 
final whistle blew ending a very exciting game It was found that the 
Tartans were on the low end of a 35-31 score. The game was played 
before a crowd of nearly ten thousand howling spectators and perhaps 
the size of the crowd made the boys nervous for a while. We can 
blame It on that anyhow.
The City of "Brotherly Love wasn't so friendly on Friday night 
when tho Plaid five Invaded Mitten Hall and the home of tlie Temple 
Owls. They got revenge for the past football defeats, for the last 
three basketball defeats, and what over other victories the Tartans 
may have scored over the Owls. They scored a nice 3G-215 victory in 
basketball and 0-?. win In boxing. I oant Imagine what old William 
Penn would have said If ho could have come to llfo and soon his na
tive Philadelphians brow beating tho Sklbo mlttmon nil 'around the 
ring.And to make matters worse tho good old Nltany Lion that has 
boon our pal for tho last four years finally turned on us and made 
tho Tartans' eastern Invasion a total loss by sneaking In a couple of 
baskets In tho last few minutes to gain a 30-27 vlotory. The Skibos 
led by two points at th half and had a four-point load with only a few 
minuto to go but It failed to do much good.* * * * *
WHETHER OR NOT THE) T1QAM WON ANY GAMES most of tho hoys 
boosted their coring averages and had a good timo to hoot. .Uni tforHtui probably took In all of tho shown and revues pimi tho Empir 
Stato building. Slogai and Silverman no doubt came homo with inoro 
money than thoy started with. Those two have surprisingly poor ap
petites in Now York, hut theycertainly like the burlesques. Trainer 
Munlmll probably visited relatives In Hoboken. He usually does. The 
gossip of tho whole trip will bo out by next week so wo will wait until 
then.'

Ernie Sesto's patched-up boxing 
team run afoul of tho Conference 
loaders In the Gym this Saturday 
when Lhe undefoatod West Virginia 
Mountalnoors arrive in town in
tent on kooping their record un
blemished. Without any attempt 
at an alibi if can truthfully bo 
stated that Carnegie had a very 
good ehanco of stopping West Vir
ginia boforo tho mid-year exaniB 
took their toll of Plalu rlngmon, 
hut as things shape up now, the 
Skibos will have to perform somo 
kind of a miracle to win from that 
classy Mountaineer squad. The 
Morgantown aggregation at. prosent. 
boasts a eomi'ortablo lead in tho 
iflastern Intercollegiate Boxing 
Conforonco and will naturally bo 
big lavorltos to win.
The Tartans took a setback 
from Temple last Friday night in 
Philadelphia, 5-2. Sesto's squad 
was made up of a few veterans 
and a largo number of new boys 
who were substituting for those 
declarqd ineligible after the mid
year exams.
Captain Henry Carr was the first 
Skibo to win a bout. Although ho 
usually fights in the 135-pound 
class, he was obliged to fill the va
cancy left by Mike Restaine in 
tho 145-pound division, and from 
all indications Mr. Sesto had no 
kick coming for the night's work. 
Henry decisively outpointed Mike 
Catanzaro, tough Owl welterweight 
in three rounds.
Jerry O'Toole likewise came 
through with a win, taking a neat 
decision from George Scurris in 
the 165-pound class. The stocky 
plaid fullback looked very promis
ing in his first encounter of the 
year.
Pete D'Allessandro, intercollegiate 
champion in the 115-pound class, 
scored a technical knockout over 
Budd Scott of Carnegie in the sec
ond stanza. Those who saw this 
little Italian work last year will 
remember that he has class and 
then some.
The most thrilling bout of the 
evening occurred in light-heavy di
vision when Tom Coulter, Mr. 
Over ends man of all work, ran 
into a stiff right to the button in 
Lhe socond round. Tom 1ms only 
been boxing a short time, and ho 
states ho had anything but an en
couraging debut. Observers state 
that ho had his man in a bad way 
in tho first round but that he 
lacked tho oxporlonce and finesso 
Lo put him away.
WITH TWO TOUGH GAMES THIS WEEK, It looks an If tho Tartan 
cagora aro going to havo a hard time In getting baok to their winning 
wayo. At any rato Coach Hannum has his work cut out for him with 
Grovo City nu tho opponont tonight, and Duquouno raring to go Friday 
night. Tho Grovers have one good team for a small college as can bo 
witnessed by thoir standing In their loaguo. They defeated Geneva 
In ono of their contests and played a close gamo with Duquesne. As 
for the Dukes, well, they have about tho classlost team in the district 
and It will take a whalo of a team to slow them down. Well, the Tar
tans turned the tablos on them last year in the second gamo and maybe 
they can do It againwho knows.* #  * *
THE PLAID SWIMMERS NOT ONLY COPPED* TWO MEETS but 
went about their business in such a manner as to break no less than 
three existing school and pool records. The natators easily downed 
Western Reserve on Friday 4-1-31 and came right back to hand Case 
a -11-23 defeat on Saturday. The 220-yard relay team negotiated the 
distance in 1:44 seconds to establish a new mark. In the Case meet 
Miller cut down tlie time on two marks. He first swam the fifty-yard 
free style in 24.5 seconds, rested up a little and did the 0110 hundred 
yards in 56.5 seconds. To show liis pal Miller that lie was not going 
to be outdone by a mere teammate, Boyer paddled his way up and 
down the pool six times in the back stroke and when he had finished 
the timer's clock said 1 minute 47.2 seconds, a new record. If the 
boys do as well against Franklin and Marshall they stand a good 
chance of coming out ahead and by like performance they should be 
able to gain a victory over New York University on Saturday night.
ILLUSION:
Look at this remarkable lady ... with diree lovely and 
pcrfcct heads... all attached to a normal body. She 
appears to sit on the stage, with the lower part of her 
body concealed by flowers. She can wink, smile, and 
nod. She can talk, laugh, and singall at the same 
time. Thousands of people have seen this feat of magic 
and pronounced it a wonderful sight!Its fun to be fooled__

EXPLANATION:
Audiences used to.pay an extra fee to go behind the 
scenes to see how this trick was worked. They dis
covered that the three-headed woman was merely a 
reflection in a mirror. The glass showed the heads of 
three girls hut the body of only one. The other two 
were cleverly hidden so that only their heads showed 
in the mirror.

Friday night when the Owl mittmen got the best of the Skibos by a 
5-2 score. The Carnegie lineup, which had to be revamped because of 
ineligibilities, was quite a bit weaker than the one that defeated Duqtiesne several weeks ago. The result was that only two victories 
were recorded by Erini Sesto's men. Captain Carr kept his record 
clean for the year by winning a decision over his opponent in the 
145-pound class, and Jerry OToole, who reported only this semester, 
came through with a well earned victory. Tom Coulter, a newcomer 
to tho fight game, received a knockout In the first bout he has ever 
had, but not until ho had downed his opponent several times in the 
first round. Saturday the boys really step Into fast company when 
they meet the undefeated West Virginia leather pushers In the Plaid

Counscllor-at-Lnw
Counsellor-at-Law by Elmer 
Rice, Nixon theater, week begin
ning March 6.
The author of "The Adding Ma
chine and Street Scene present
ed two plays in New York last sea
son, ".The Left. Bank and Counsellor-at-Law. and a few weeks 
ago offered another, "We, the Peo
ple, which at last reports Is about 
to close. Both this play and "The 
Left Batik would have fared long 
and successfully if more playgoers, 
were interested in the dramatic 
discussion oC ideas. Elmer Rice 
apparently is, but in Counsellorat-Law he was willing to be more 
concerned with telling an exciting 
story and to let his ideas peep 
through.
His first act suggests that he is 
applying to a lawyers office the 
same kind of selective and minute 
observation of characteristic de
tails that made the people in the 
brown stone house of his most fa
mous play vivid with color, racial 
differences, and individual ear
marks. Office, clients and clerks 
at once take on the air of being 
typical, amusingly exhibiting the 
traits that' cause in the audience 
smiles of recognition, and convey
ing the illusion of a natural reality 
like that of any day in that same 
office. By such accumulation of de
tail and incident, shrewdly pointed 
to create-atmosphere and elicit in
dulgent sympathy with the foibles 
of tho characters, Mr. Rice se
curely leads his listeners to high 
expectancy in meeting his heroa 
Jewish lawyer, who dominates his 
world by sheer dint of brain pow
er, loyalty to his friends, readiness 
to wrest the technicalities of the
law to save the oppressed, and con
viction that tho spirit is above the 
letter. Granted that such a man 
may lack the veneer of culture,1 
may 'even be unscrupulous in at
taining a good human end by ques
tionable means; Mi\ Rice seems to 
ask whether there is not a saving 
grace about him, whether, his heart 
is not pure gold, and whether wo 
are notsuperficial in letting our 
social prejudices blind us to gen
uine values.
These points are merely Implied 
in the melodrama that starts in 
full swing with the second act and 
is at its tensest when the fiual cur
tain falls. Sentiment and villainy, 
threats and countermining, mother 
love, redeemed burglars who malto 
good-rall these are fv.eshly. woven' 
into a good plot that never lets 
down interest.or. interferes with 
the consistency of the-, people of' 
the story. True, Mr. Rice daubs 
with pitch the "elegant folk" whom 
he evidently dislikes, and he may 
thus be gotting off his chest as a 
former lawyer some remembered 
grievance, but unctiiqu's hatred of 
a villain is a righteous feeling to 
have before the excitement of a 
melodrama and in this case it is 
rationally justified.
Paul Muni as the lawyer is com
manding, resourceful in technique, 
and withal buoyant. His perform
ance, in fact, is eminently distin
guished and provides a double rea
son for attendance. The company 
in several instances has boon 
changed since the. first run in New 
York, but the play is so effective 
theatrically that there is not iilcely 
to be much noticeable-lessoning in 
the force of the general impres
sion.
Prompt returns of the ticket 
sales for the dances held by the 
Night Student Council would be 
appreciated. There are still 
some ticket returns.to be made 
for the Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance, and the Post-Holiday 
Dance. Returns should be made

Th study hall in. th College ot 
Engineering-is indeed an interest
ing place to visit. All sizes and 
shapes of engineers, or students 
hoping to be engineers, are present 
nightly before classes commence. 
The best time to view this abode 
of wisdom and quiet. thought is 
before the seven-thirty class, when 
the crowd is large and diverse.
An instance of the charm anil 
dignity that pervades this quiet 
place of study was observed one 
night last week. At the black
board located at the front of the 
rom,..three students argued vio
lently as to tiie position of a dpci: 
mal point. , At one table, several 
men were disturbed who were 
intent on their work and looked up 
from it only momentarily, and 
then to cast a glance of disgust at 
the wranglers. -
A second table was crowded with 
students of the intelligensia class, 
who could find no interest in pro
saic matters. All were learnedly 
discussing different subjects, 
among which were repeal, assas
sins, final examinations, individuals 
of the feminine gender, dogs, 
bridge, physics, mechanics, dates, 
and what have you?
The main thought and inspira
tion to be derived from this present 
writing is, unless you can concen
trate calmly in a boiler factory 
during the rush season, you had 
better do your -studying anywhere 
but in the study room. It . is too 
noisy, and it-might'be2well'-if the 
volume of noise was decreased by 
fat least one-half.
While the study. room always 
has been in the nature of a club 
room, in addition to its function as 
a place for study, those taking ad
vantage of the privilege of such a 
room set aside primarily to pro; vide ti -working place for the stu
dents should, have a little consid
eration for those who find it'ne
cessary to do their exercises there, 
and who are distracted by the un
necessary noise often present.
Much ink has been spilled since 
last otir "eloquent pen was lifted 
in panegyrical outpourings on a 
major art show. Perhaps much 
more will have to be spilled if 
such diaristic discourses are to 
cease permanently. Nevertheless, 
our tolerant attitude of a year ago 
toward all pictures has been cast 
to the winds, and we venture forth 
to pick the gold from the pinch
beck, with the scorn of a cynic.
SuOicetli to say before proceed
ing with our commentary, that de
pressions may come and depress
ions may go, but art shows will 
continue to delight and puzzle us 
forever.
The long awaited exhibition of 
the Associated Artists of Pitts
burgh is running true to tradition. 
Here society ladies and students, 
college professors and sons-o-theslums are exhibiting side by side; 
each masterpiece beckoning tho 
layman and critic to behold and 
praise the noble and gifted soul of 
my master.'
Upon entering the galleries, the 
first pictures to greet our eyes are 
the prize winners, "Liberty Bridge 
by the venerable John Kane, and 
the group pictures of Alfred Bennet, artist ex-officio and pants man
ufacturer extraordinary. Both 
men have .achieved the highest dis
tinctions ever accorded local 
artists, both reveal the same 
salient characteristics in their 
work, and both are indifferent to 
art schools.
All of which seems to disprove 
the pet theory of one of our own 
Carnegie professors, that to be an 
artist one must live and think art 
twenty-four hours a day.
Kanes Style Unchanged
About all that can be said in 
favor of Kane's picture is that it 
has good design beside a profusion 
of childish detail. Inconspicuous 
little box cars and bill boards are 
emblazoned with such frolicsome 
inscriptions as the B. & O. Rail
road and Erie Baking Company. 
Incidently his characteristic little 
cotton ball clouds have disappeared 
from his paintings.
The jury, that selected Bennets 
paintings must have been very con
servative indeed. His . House
boats is so pictorial and prosaic, 
that it would quite" easily pass for 
a photographic shot in any roto
gravure section.
Winter by Roy Hilton is a most 
captivating picture. All of Mr. Hil
tons paintings possess dignity of 
composure, and a quality and tech
nique that is distinctive. His 
choice of a variety of subjects 
probably explains why these works 
are the most popular in the exhi
bition.
While one cannot instantly grasp 
the meaning of Shadows by Rus
sel Hyde, it. nevertheless produces
Gee, did. you notice the Tartan 
last week'? That was some paper. 
I had to take a week off to read it. 
Dont remember when the Tartan 
had so much news before. Its get
ting to be a real paper these days. 
Would be fine if we could have 
every, issue as large as the last 
one. That would mean news, news, 
and more news. Sure were a great 
many tilings to write about and af
fairs to attend. It seems that the 
day students as well as the night 
students bad every inch of the 
week taken up.
Another triumph can be credited 
to the Night Student Council with 
the brilliant success of the Wash
ington's Birthday Dance last Wed
nesday evening. The mens gym
nasium which is the scene of many 
spectacular athletic events as
sume^ the dignity of a grand and 
beautiful ball room where the 
terpsichorean art a la modern 
rhythm was danced by ultra-mod
ern youth.
 Tis a far cry from the grace 
ful minuet of colonial times and 
forty years ago to the dog trots 
of today mourned one dignified 
chaperon, but its vigorous and 
entertaining and I suppose it gets 
in oneV blood," he commented 
tolerably. Nevertheless we say, a 
more fitting climax to a day of. 
reverence could not have been con
ceived.
Syncopated music of the highest 
quality was furnished by Will 
Ryshanek and his NBC broadcast
ing orchestra. This popular young 
maestro, who started his rise to 
popularity after playing at a night 
student function, is considered one 
of the foremost orchestra leaders 
in the district, enjoys tremendous 
popularity, and is in demand at 
college functions. The social com
mittee should consider itself for
tunate in having secured his serv
ices for this affair.
The entire decorative scheme 
hinged on a large revolving crys
tal ball studded with scintilatiug 
mirrors, suspended high over the 
center of the dance floor. Stream
ers of vari-coiored pennants were 
gathered at a point above the ball 
to form a great canopy completely 
enveloping the ceiling high above. 
An heroic sized head of Washing
ton in luminous violet tint thrown 
upon the screen completed the 
decorative scheme. As one danced 
under the colored streamers a feel
ing was created of being inside a 
huge gaily decorated tent.
In. this atmosphere of light and 
color the dancers could hardly do 
anything else but enjoy themselves 
and this they did to the utmost. 
Refreshments were served and the 
demand made upon the booth cer
tainly showed that it was a popu
lar place.
As is always the case, although 
unwelcomed, the end comes all too 
soon, and the dancers reluctantly 
departed after having enjoyed one 
of the happiest evenings on the 
campus this season._________________

Interest Aroused 
By Eug. Banquet
Editors Note.A communica
tion has been received from a per
son connected with the institute 
which presents an impression cre
ated by the activities of the night 
group. Believing that the corre
spondence might be of interest to 
the night student body it is being 
published, however the writers 
identity is being withheld at his 
request.
Considerable interest is aroused 
among the night students in the 
College of Engineering over the 
banquet to be bald 911 March 11 
next. This will be the eighteenth 
time the college lias held the func
tion and the officers in charge are 
determined to make the coming 
banquet the equal of any previous 
one.
Tickets are being sold by the 
night engineer students and the 
cost has been set at a very low 
figure$1.00 per plate. A very 
fine program of entertainment is 
being scheduled for the guests who 
will be present in the Ball Room 
of .the Roosevelt Hotel that even
ing.
In order to make a preliminary 
estimate of the number who will 
be present, those who expect to 
attend are requested to make their 
purchases early. In setting the 
cost of the plate at $1.00. the offi
cers were aware of the fact that 
funds are somewhat low, but they 
have not sacrificed the banquet one 
bit. So reserve March 11 for a big 
night with your fellow classmates.
With all the news we must be 
getting news-minded at Carnegie. 
Bet the old editor had his fingers 
on all the wires of the news agen
cies. Even the alumni clans were 
"clanning1' along with their contri
butionsfor instance, Philadelphia 
and Youngstown.. Must be fine to 
be in the alumni group when you 
can say that you are a finished 
product of the college. Some day 
I hope to be numbered in that col
umn and then watch me do my 
stuff. Nobody will be able to hold 
me then.
During the past week the writer 
witnessed a very striking example 
of co-operation on the part of a 
student group on the campus. 
Having had occasion to be at the 
Gymnasium during the 'afternoon 
of Washingons Birthday, I could 
not help but wonder at the manner 
in which preparations were being 
made, for a function which seemed 
to be of a social nature.
Upon inquiry it developed that 
the affair was the Washingtons 
Birthday 'Daiice which was being 
held in the gymnasium. 100 that 
evening by the. NightStudent 
Council. Groups were scattered 
at)but the large floor engaged in 
various tasks and it was not long 
before a transformation had taken 
place in the gymnasium. My curi
osity was aroused sufficiently to 
make me' return in the evening to 
see what effect would be produced 
by the work which had been done 
by these students of the night col
lege. .
The evening having arrived, I 
entered the gymnasium and my 
astonishment . was . great indeed. 
Beautiful lighting effects were pro
duced and nestled within an enclo
sure of pennants was a crystal 
ball, like a gem, revolving without 
any apparent effort or force, send
ing out lights of multi-colored hues. 
Glancing at the stage I saw a very 
unique piece of workmanship. It 
was a projection of a likeness of 
Washington in whose honor the 
dance was being held.
Everywhere were groups of hap
py dancers who seemed to be en
joying the party, for hardly an
other name could describe the 
function.; I was thrilled to see 
such a spirit existing among a col
lege group. Everyone seemed to 
enter into the spirit of the dance 
and they Avere thoroughly enjoying 
themselves. I must confess that 
this spirit of whoiesome enjoy
ment was gratifying to note. I 
could not leave the place, so stayed 
until the last dance was played 
and then went for my wraps.
The lights were dimmed and be
fore I could realize what had taken 
place a group . of students was 
again busy, this time. dismantling 
the gymnasium. Some were work
ing 100 the lights, some on the 
streamers, some on the large ball, 
and some 100 the stage. It was 
not long before the whole. audi
torium was denuded of its color
ful decorations and the cold aspect 
of the  gymnasium assumed its 
natural look again. Upon inquiry 
as to why the haste in dismantling 
the place, I was told that classes 
were scheduled the next morning, 
and basketball games would be 
played, so the decorations had to 
be removed.
Too much praise cannot be given 
to such a group of workers, and I 
wonder how those in charge could 
think up and plan such affairs in 
addition to attending to their 
studies at night. The night coun
cil certainly should be happy that 
it has students who are willing to 
help put over such a successful af
fair and those in charge of the 
dance are to be commended for 
their work. I. have heard a great 
deal about the lack of school 
spirit, but must confess that what 
I witnessed at this dance certainly 
demonstrated that there is one 
group at least which seems to have 
spirit enough to support its activ
ity. Again I must repeat that 
those .who planned the affair and 
worked 100 it to make it such a 
colorful party are to be congratu
lated for their painstaking efforts 
and their work should be an incen
tive for other groups to duplicate.

Disco 1111 led by ExpertsI see that the clans will hold the 
Clan Day on March 11. What a 
coincidence, we are .going to hold 
our night engineering banquet on 
the same night, so why not make 
it a clan night and celebrate too? 
All my fellow engineers should be 
out for the big time which we are 
going to have at the Roosevelt

over and there should be no hesita

be launched on a new era of pros

The conclusions that wero drawn 
were us follows: Aluminum does
not affoct foodstuffs in any way that 
would produce ill effects on tho

does not destroy any of tho vita

taken to undo many of tho preju

form of cooking utensils, and sim

Depression Pictures Shown
Few depression pictures have 
made their appearances in the 
present show. Apparently few 
artists are impecunious enough or 
have felt the sorrowing aspects of 
depression life to paint its gloomy 
solemnity. Estelle Thomas how
ever comes forth with .lfl.2S)-liK50, 
contrasting in somber manner tho 
two classes of leisure.
"A Family Group by Ralph 
Bowman is also a depression picturo, but. its bright reds and greens 
while decorative, certainly do not 
suggest suffering and starvation

THAT one of our first citizens

THAT the size of the crowd 
reminds us of the good old

something to do with it.
THAT those two girls who

THAT by this time you must 
be convinced that it was some

off this may continue far into 
the night.
THAT that's that and I'll be 
seenya.
I always said that a college train
ing would be an advantage and i 
am glad to note that I have some 
support to my argument. An ar
ticle in the last issue of the Tar
tan stated that an institution simi
lar to ours had traced one thousand 
of its graduates and found that a 
big percentage of them held swell 
positions. Thats the kind I am 
looking for and I hope it wont be 
long before I can get into that 
class, even if I am compelled to do 
so by getting a sponge and wet
ting itr-^that would be a swell af
fair, at least.
Yes, some people are still look
ing for the cause and cure for the 
depression. Why they only have 
to go to a laundry and they will sea 
de press on every day. What some 
of us need to do is to send our bank 
accounts to the laundry aiid get 
them ironed out these days. Then 
they might possibly stretch over the 
big gap between our deposits and 
the checks which have come back 
highly ornamented with the fa
mous NSF. But even if they do 
come back so marked we havo the 
satisfaction of knowing that we 
have company.
Who would think that there are 
college men, yes even instructors 
who cant-name the States in the 
Union. That must be interesting.
I am glad to note that we have a 
state of New Orleans, one of South
ern California, one of Omaha, and 
when one.thinks that down in 
Washington we have a state of the

they could find two more senators

Surely must be interesting for

THE OAKLAND

I note that someone seems to 
know a great deal about the loan 
banks for the homes. What I would 
like to know is when they are go
ing to give homes away. That is, 
well you know, all the homes that 
have become involved since the de
pression started. It would be a 
good thing if some real help wa? 
given instead of the proverbial red 
tape, the same tape we are told 
that binds everything but the right

in the wash when the time comes,

they get around to it. We shall 
see what we shall see.

This Business of Subsidalion
Of late, the subsidized athlete again is the center of! at
tention. What is his.plight? Is he to be a relic ol! the past? 
Thus, the questions arc /red from all sides. It is of interest to 
see some, of the larger colleges and universities oi! the country 
taking steps which will supposedly eliminate athletic scholar
ships, The trend is not new; many of the smaller colleges have 
abolished athletic scholarships during the past several years.
What is the significance of this newest development? Does 
it mean that all college athletic competition will be reduced to a simon pure basis and the athlete will no longer be on his 
Alma Maters payroll? Hardly. Obviously, the movement is a result of the extreme financial difficulties being experienced 
by collegeseverywhere.
Professionalism in college athletics has been an object of 
criticism for some time, and it has been suggested that since 
athletics in most placesfootball and basketball in particular 
liavo been placed on a commercial basis that the colleges should 
hire professionals to represent them and provide good shows 
for the students, lladical} we must say! But, why notarent 
the students more interested in a winning team rather than in 
the benefits athletics provide for the participants? A debatable 
point, to be sure, but it is quite evident, especially in the larger 
schools, that the original purpose of college athletics has been 
defeated'the purpose oi: providing physical development for 
students. This is why some colleges have set up highly efficient 
systems of intramural competition to supplement, and in some 
places to take the place of, varsity competition.
It is the bigoted person who flays the athlete as a leachJike individual who sucks his college subsistence from the cheek 
book of his schools athletic association. Athletes are en
titled to remuneration in proportion to their efforts, as are all 
other students who hold responsible positions in cxtra-curricu-. 
Jar activities.
it is evident that the present method of compensation is 
not satisfactory. It is unjust in the sense that it gives the ath
lete an unfair financial advantage over other students in extra
curricular activities. In all other activities students must work 
for two or three years before they are eligible for a salary posi
tion and then only a very small percentage ol' the student body 
is able to receive salaries because ol! the limited number of sal
aried positions available. In other activities there is a spirit of 
competition existing, which is wholesome and worthwhile, the 
salaried positions being the goals at which the competitors ef
forts are aimed. Paradoxically, this spirit of competition is 
.sometimes lacking in athletics. It is unjust in that it gives 
the subsidized athlete an unfair advantage over the students 
who desire to participate in varsity competition, yet are )iol 
given an opportunity to display their abilities. Coaches will 
protest this statement. Nevertheless, such a condition docs 
exist and it is not a satisfactory arrangement.
It is hard to soe why the athletic associations invest
ments" should be given advantages over non-subsidizod athiletes. it is most discouraging to the student who attends prac
tices regularly and spiritedly only to find that ho is being 
used as a sandbag to stave off the onslaughts of his more for
tunate team mates.
There is much to bo said for the do-or-die spirit manifested 
by high school athletes, for it teaches co-operation for a com
mon purpose-to win. At. the present time, if the school is 
represented by a team which is not a winner in most of its con
tests, despite the fact that the contests are often decided by 
one-point margins and the games themselves are interesting, the 
students are dissatisfied. It is believed that good money is being 
paid to the athletes by the student body through, /the student 
activities fees and therefore they should be entitled 1b a good 
show. To any one who knows the facts about the usual situa
tion, this beliof is far-fetched because this is not quite the true 
picture, yet the commercial tinge remains.
The glorified scrub is probably the biggest goat of the un
just system and his fighting spirit is soon dampened .by dis
couragement and disgust. But to win docs not necessarily 
mean that the investments must be the men to win. Too 
often the ambitious non-investment is more enthusiastic 
about winning than is the subsidized man. The subsidized 
athlete will offer opposition to this, but what will.he say about 
the scholarship and salaried athlete who played on one of the 
teams of a large eastern university that said that he would as 
soon sit on the bench as play because it was much easier way 
of getting his pay than wallowing in the mud. And, anyway, 
he had worked hard all week during the practice sessions. This 
type of individual is the product of a commercial system and it 
is not hard to imagine the extent of his enthusiasm while he 
played in a regular game.
Last year the Tartan advocated placing athletic scholar
ship awarding upon a competitive basis, awards to be made at 
the end of each year for each succeeding year and to be given 
only to those players who have displayed the proper spirit and 
ability. A limited number of scholarships could be offered so 
that each of the players would realize that lie must work hard 
to be included among the limited number. Some of the benefits 
which might accrue from such a plan might be summed as 
follows:
1. It would reward worthy athletes for abilities, Bpirlt, and 
effort, and would place the remuneration on a similar lovol 
with that given to student in othor oxtra-currlcular activi
ties.
2. It would provide an incontlvo for the present non-subsidizod 
atlilotos and give them an opportunity to rocolvo scholar
ships if they become proficient and display the proper char
acteristics upon which awards are to bo made.
3. It would groatly reduce the budgets of athletic associa
tions by limiting the amount which could bo given to each 
one of the selected men.
4. It would relieve college athletics from the distasteful pro
fessional taint and should restore a spirit of competition 
which has grown lethargic.
There is no doubt that it would take a few years to read
just the present situation and apply such a plan. In face of 
much opposition and shaking of heads Penn State has been suc
cessful in appl}ring a new system, as well as have other schools 
in the country, and there is no reason why a well-planned and 
well-organized scholarship plan as outlined, which would offer 
tuition or meals, not both, to athletes in all sports after the 
men had been in school for at least one school year and had 
displayed the proper qualifications to receive awards could not 
be successfully and advantageously applied.
The older generation  the one 
that got AC into the most terrible 
war that the world has ever expe
rienced, that got AC into a most 
unworkable peace as a settlement 
of that war, and that today lias us 
in the throes of the worst panic 
that was ever any age's lotthis 
generation has been wont to say 
to us in almost every emergency, 
"Use your common sense. Here 
was a touchstone, a cure all. It 
contained the answer to every 
problem; It was the light for the 
uncomprehending darkness; it was 
the polo star for the lost course; 
It was the secret path out of the 
wilderness. Its merits are here ex
pressed as of the past, for the 
great tragedies of this older gener
ation must cause us to question its 
RLESEeev and saving power. In fact 
it may be that the meaning of 
"common sense is not clear, or 
that the idea that it expressed 
never was well enough defined to 
make it anything more than a gen
eralization, used for the purpose of 
escaping reality.
The accepted definition of the 
phrase is good, sound, ordinary 
sense." Of this conception we 
may say that the "sense" here de
fined Is hardly "common." This 
meaning, however, Is substantiated 
by what the philosophers say of 
common sense: "The unreflective 
opinions of ordinary men; the 
Ideas and conceptions of a man un
trained in dialectic." From this 
statement It would appear that the 
judgments based on common sense 
are not only unscientific and un
studied, but also largely a matter 
of guess work. The "common 
sense" philosopher might be one 
with a large store of information 
which has not been properly ar
ranged; lie might, be one who is 
skilled In one trade or art, but 
who, thinking that that skill might 
have some transfer value in an
other, has not troubled himself to 
determine the extent of the rela
tionship. At best the conclusions 
arrived at, being unreflective and  
without dialectic skill, cannot bo 
considered scientific or. logical.
Perhaps one of the faults of our 
social structure is that it is built 
solidly on a "common sense" foun
dation; whereas this highly spe
cialized age, one that deals very 
extensively in reflection and re
search, needs for its society a 
foundation made by something bet
ter ordered and better planned 
than an untrained and unreflective 
mind could produce.
CARNEGIE
HONORARIES
CWENS
The Carnegie Eta Chapter of the 
Gwens, National Sophomore Hon
orary for women, was founded in 
November 11)28 as the Acloas Hon
orary Socloty and was admitted to 
the Cwons national organization 
the next yonr. Carnegie was the 
seventh school In the country to 
organize a Cwons chapter.
According to the constitution of 
tho Cwons, freshmen women who 
have high scholastic records, who 
have boon outstanding In leader
ship and service in activities dur
ing their freshman year, and who 
rank high in character are called 
to the organization on tho Spring 
Qualification Day. Tho purpose of 
tho society is to promote research, 
leadership, service, and culture 
among freshmen and sophomoro 
women, and specifically to provide 
an Incentive for freshman women 
to attain a higher degree of schol
arship, to help them to become ad
justed to campus life, and to in
troduce them to the various ac
tivities on the campus.
So far: this year the Cwens have 
carried out their purpose by ac
tivities designed to welcome fresh
men and transfer.students, includ
ing receptions, teas, dinners for 
freshmen and participation in 
freshman Play Day; by means of 
Tea Dances to which the Pitt Chap
ter of Cwens)was invited; and by 
selling candy at the performance 
of Itigoletto sponsored by the 
Women's Scholarship Organization.
The Cwens are chosen from 
Fine Arts and Margaret Morrison 
Colleges in proportion to the num
ber of women in the school. The 
membership of the society is kept 
somewhere near to IS, the present 
number. The officers and present 
members are: Eleanor Sherman, 
president; Veronica Kloos, vice 
president; Virginia Siegel, secre
tary; Madolin Vautrinot, treas
urer; Margaret Barr, Daisey 
Clarke, Virginia Cooper, Mary 
Duncan, Margaret Griffin, Julia 
Hubbard, Elizabeth Lowrey, Nancy 
McQuade, Mary llowlos, Nancy 
Shelly, Margaret Watters, Florence 
Weaver, Mary Withum and Mary 
Wynne.
FROMTHEFENCE
SPRING?
This recent spell of fair weather brought the 
signs of spring back to the campus in full force. 
Art students sketching under the trees, a crowd
ed senior fence, couples taking noon hour strolls, 
and that most famous of Carnegie institutions, 
the field house line-up have been In evidence. 
The reviewing corps was once more in swing 
with its root-ity-toot-a-root,ily-toot whistle run
ning competi
tion to the ar
chitects who 
do their ob
serving from 
the higher al
titudes in the 
Arts School. 
One p1e b e 
found courage 
enough to get DUt a spring dress. In spring, a young mans 
fancy lightly turns, and strange as it seems, so 
does a columnists, with the result that when the 
dead line rolled around we didnt have a thing 
to write about. This is our excuse for turning 
over most of tho column to our contributors for a 
change. We hope you like it.*****
FROM OUR SKIBO SCOUT
Comes the following bit of red hot news items: 
According to that ace of authorities, Vic Ma

Two of our fair co-eds are very much perplexed 
by the meaning of the term "College Widow.

class to sleep.
And a last minute observation has it that Frank 
Schneller Is circulating again.
Our scout leaves us with the-following mystery 
to Bolve, "Who Is El Toro?*****
WHICH BRINGS TO MIND
That the Theta XI boys held an "Engineers' 
Brawl" as a counter attraction to the Arts Ball.
The Pi D. E. boys had a lecture-smoker for 
some of the hard working publications boys and 
persuaded the public speaking Prof. to give a 
talk.
A large number of anonymous and interesting
letters of criticism are received by the author of 
the Fence (dont guess, youre wrong) from time 
to time. All letters of criticism are heartily wel
comed, but it is impossible to use contributions 
from unknown sources.*****
THE INTERSORORITY
The dance of dances for the art school greekesses is now past history. As usual the (lance, 
with its very select attendance, was one of the 
outstanding successes of the current social sea
son. With Dick Gaertners boys proving such a 
tremendous hit that they were forced to play al
most a half hour over the scheduled limit to sat
isfy the dancers. The old standbys were all 
there. Chairman Edmundson and Bob Schell, 
Max Plekarski. and Joe Lentz, Becky .Williams 
and Fred Rankin, Mandolin Vautrinot and Char
les Schalvet, Ray Mareness and A1 Redding (Mr. 
and Mrs. now), and Puppet Art Editor Edna 
Pearson.
The evening saw an ambition of some months 
realized for Nels Johnson, but since the Arts 
Ball nothing can surprise him. Bee Archer was 
there with Tom Wardel and Margey Bateman was 
escorted by AJ Priddy, gardenia in button hole. ' 
Sandwiches and parfet, the good old stand-bys, 
were also served to the recently re-united Hymies, Farrel and Landau.*****
AND THE OPERA
Rigoletto, sponsored by the Woman's Schol
arship organization and promoted by its hard
working chairman (or woman), Christine Leighou, was a tremendous success. Student Coun
cil was there 
in a body with 
only a few 
brave enough 
to make it a date. Tom 
Coulter, fresh 
from his re
cent invasion 
of the City of 
B r o t h e r 1 y 
Love, did a gentleman Jim act from tights to Tux 
in. twenty-four hours. Joe Lentz, Bill Lazarus, 
Jack Hiltz, and John Kronenberg were the only 
ones with dates. The girls just couldnt' get to
gether on the price they wanted for the candy 
they sold between acts.
The Phi Kappa pledges ran competition in the 
form of a pledge dance (you should see the Wal
ter Wlnchell programs) and the Kappa Sig 
pledges had their smoker. They tell us that none 
of the rival pledges were able to make off with 
the remaining cigars this year.
LITTLE THEATER REVIEW
______________________By WARD WARREN _____
In "The Ivory Door Mr. A. A. 
Milne lias written a play that 
possesses the beauty of a delicately 
conceived fairy tale. The tremend
ous difficulty of transferring such 
a chimerical piece to the stage 
must inspire an increased under
standing of the work of the De
partment of Drama in all who wit
ness the Little Theater production 
of Mr. Milnes play that is being 
repeated every night this week.
The story, whose scene is laid in 
an imaginary medieval country, be
gins: "Once upon a time there was 
a king. Depending upon your 
your point of view, this king either 
fortunately or unfortunately had it 
pervading desire lor truth. It was 
because of tills characteristic that 
this King Porlvalo on Ills marriage 
day decided to vonluro through the 
feared Ivory door that opens from 
the throne room, tho door of which 
logond says that none who have 
passod through liavo ever come 
back, that evil spirits and dovlls 
hide behind It.
The king finds nothing behind 
tho Ivory door but a long and nar
row passage, and the disillusioned 
Porlvalo finds himself at length 
beyond the castlo walls. Then it 
Is that the young king learns how 
dollcato a tiling is truth. Ho and 
his betrothed, the Princess Lillia, 
bocomo involved in a series of 
amusing complications as a result 
of his defiance of tho legend of the 
Ivory door, afid these situations are 
straightened out in the end by 
means of tho very same agency 
that caused them in the beginning.
There is little plot to this play, 
and its success or lack of It depends 
upon their interpretation and qual
ity of the playing. The perform

cape the uneveness frequently no

the painstaking direction the 
play had obviously been given.

ever, seemed to indicate that they 
were of an individual responsibil
ity.
The young Prince Perivale (Jane 
Wittmer) of the first scene was 
personable and engaging, his eager 
curiosity arousing a warmly sym
pathetic  reaction. This scene is 
perhaps one of the nicest in the 
play. The grown prince, then King 
Pericale (John Dawson), however, 
lacked those qualities, and it may 
be that much of the coldness ex
hibited by the audience was caused 
by this contrast in personalities: 
tho pattern was not carried for
ward with its original motif.
The Princess Lillia (Janet Feath
ers) fulfilled the requirements of an 
attractive and appealing heroine. 
Tliora (Mary Dingfelder), maid to 
Her Royal I-Hgliness, was played 
with nice restraint and simplicity, 
especially in her first scene with 
King Perivale.
The Captain of the Guard (Don 
Gal higher) was generally too loud 
and dangerously close to over-act
ing. His drunk scene suffered par
ticularly because of this exaggera
tion. Tho Chancellor (Robert 
Gill), high priest of state affairs, 
was played evenly, but unevent
fully.
Brand (Emanuel Breakstone) 
might have been more at ease, and 
therefore more genuine and con
vincing. The minor supporting 
characters, soldiers, townspeople, 
and "others, added much to the 
color and atmosphere of the pro
duction and in most cases capably 
did their bit toward providing a 
pleasing evenings entertainment.
As usual, the costuming was ex
cellent and authentic, except for a 
few pairs of twentieth century 
shoes that were very much in evi
dence. The three sets were very 
attractively done, especially the one 
outside the castle wall. The room 
within the castle radiated color in
terestingly, with varied colored 
light coming through the window. 
The courtyard scene, quite impos
ing and massive, was featured by 
an intricate arrangement of the 
steps leading to the lieav}- gates.
Langer to Give 
Science Lecture 
Thursday Night
The Academy of Science and 
Art, a local organization interested 
in the advancement of science and 
art, will sponsor another in its se
ries of lectures Thursday evening 
at 8:15 in the Carnegie Lecture 
Hall. This lecture, The Effect of 
Radiation in its Production and 
Cure of Diseases, will be deliv
ered by Dr. Heinz Langer, M. D., 
director of the Deep Therapy and 
Physiotherapy Department at the 
Western Pennsylvania Hospital.
In a paper written by Dr. Langer 
011 the subject, which will be refer
red to during the lecture, he 
states: The natural sunlight from 
which we derive our visible spec
trum is our source of radiation 
which is prescribed daily and is of 
great benefit In the practice of 
medicine. Science lias, in addi
tion, discovered and put to work 
the various rays with which we are 
constantly treating disease, and 
even occasionally producing pa
thology."
The lecture by Dr. Langer will 
Include a discussion of the advan
tages and tho extreme dangers of 
the sunlight as well as the advant
ages and dangers of high fre
quency radiation, ultraviolet light, 
roentgen ray, and radium.

Seniors Use Press Patterns 
In Making Spring Outfits
Members of Costume Department Demonstrate 
TliatAttractive and [Fell-DesignedDresses Can 
Be Made at a Cost of Less Tlian One Dollar
By CHRISTIN
By request of the Pittsburgh 
Press, several Margaret Morrison 
senior girls from the Department 
of Costume Economics recently 
used Press patterns to show how 
the completed new style-book crea
tions appear and how attractive as 
well as practical spring outfits can 
be made with Httle-i cost. Miss. 
Virginia M. Alexander, head of the 
Department of Costume Economics, 
showed three of the costumes, a 
young womans silk afternoon 
dress and two childrens frocks, 
that had been made in the class
room from the Press patterns.
The three patterns, "brought to 
life and each typical of a new 
spring style, were produced under 
the supervision of Miss Josephine 
Richards of the Childrens Cloth
ing courses and Mrs. Hazel Parisi 
of the professional course. A pret
ty gingham dress, sleeveless and 
with contrasting collar, was made 
by Margaret Calvin with Gloria 
Cavalier, five years old, as model. 
The dress fitted perfectly without 
alteration, and its entire cost was 
but 74 cents. Katherine Winslow 
chose another style of childrens 
dress and used a pattern for a 
smart little afternoon or school 
dress with long sleeves and con
trasting colar. It was made for 
Suzanne Burrey, five years old, 
with percale used and popin collar 
and cuffs, its total cost was 77 
cents. The jroung womans dress 
was made by RachelBoyce and 
Marion Osburn 34 was her model. 
Miss Boyce selected silk for her 
pattern to style a cliic afternoon 
frock for spring wear. The same 
pattern could be used for a house 
dress made with cotton or rayon, 
making its minimum cost approxi
mately one dollar, whereas with 
good quality silk crepe the dress 
would be worth about $5.00.________

The patterns were easily follow
ed, and the dresses were made 
without difficulty. The girls usu
ally design and assemble their own 
patterns, as classwork is of a crea
tive nature, but the Press patterns 
were so accurate that only minor 
changes were made when at all. 
Forty girls'are working for major 
credits and sixty take elective 
courses in some phase of dress
making. In the old days, girls 
learned their trade in a dress
making shop in a long, tedious 
process, but Margaret Morrison 
dressmakers receive a very differ
ent training. They are first as
signed to make a dressmakers 
form corresponding to their own 
measurements, are taught to cut 
from patterns, plan costumes and 
draft-patterns, or cut patterns 
from muslin and fit on forms and 
drape. Their first problems are 
childrens clothes, making com
plete wardrobes for infants and 
children up to the age of 14. Many 
faculty mothers supply money for 
material, and the girls-fit out their 
small children. Donations are 
often received to "buy material for 
layettes to make for -charitable in
stitutions. The - last step is the 
making of their own clothes, which 
range from fur-trimmed winter 
coats to elaborate evening gowns. 
Art courses are required in the 
curriculum,- but the object is not 
perfection in drawing or painting 
as much as in design and in sense 
of colpr and line. Batik work, dye
ing and weaving are given as spe
cial courses. Not all the girls are 
studying to be dressmakers, for a 
knowledge of merchandise, cos
tume design and styles, material, 
color and line are gained from the 
course. Miss Alexander says none 
of her proteges will ever be 
fooled on a bargain.______________
THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
Joseph Stalin has again ordered 
his Soviet soldiers to parade be
fore him in review. He points to 
the borders of Russia and states 
that the entire world is armed and 
that his people cannot take a 
chance of being caught unawares.. 
The orient is already in a state of 
chaos. That he fears Japan is evi
dent since his troops are in a mo
bilized state along the borders of 
Russia nearest Manchuria.
This militaristic display is the 
second he lias called in less than 
a month. A few weeks back there 
was a display of armed men and 
war machines which lasted from 
dawn until dark. Japan seems to 
be able to make large countries 
tremble. First China, the most 
densely populated nation in the 
world, was humbled by Japan, and 
now is Russia making evident her 
fear of Japan?
Following up our discussion of 
last week about the repeal of 
prohibition and the Blaine Bill we 
can now watch the fight between 
the wets and drys to respectfully 
speed up and stop ratification.
If the drys can stop thirteen 
states from ratifying the Blaine 
Bill they can keep prohibition. Ac
cording to statements issued by 
their leaders they will-concentrate 
their efforts on the states which 
are uncertain. Those which are 
pronouncedly wet or dry will not 
even be campaigned by the drys.
The wets have a much bigger 
problem on their hands because 
they cannot afford to concentrate 
their effort on few states. They 
must.swing the ones who hang in 
the balance, hold the already wet 
states, and try to swing some of 
the states which are now' dry.
If the present line up of the con
gressmen is an indication, the 
wets should emerge the victors, 
since they now show that there is 
a three-fourtlis majority waiting to 
greet the advocates of liquor. 
When the new Congress meets 
there will be a larger wet majority
than there was before, since all of 
the dry lame-ducks will be gone.
If you have noticed any pictures 
taken of President Hoover in the 
past few weeks no doubt you have 
noticed that many of the lines and 
furrows hve disappeared from his 
face. That winning smile he pos
sessed before he became President 
is returning. The great burden 
lifted from his shoulders has ob
viously left him with a lighter 
heart.
He has refused to make any 
statements as to what he thinks of 
Roosevelts policies. All that he 
asks of the people of this country 
is co-operation for the new admin
istration. He has made some sug
gestions for the reconstruction 
which should soon be evident. He 
asks for the gold standard in order 
that the barriers of trade can be 
reduced. Mr. Hoover lias worked 
hard and conscientiously at his 
job and deserves a happy life 
when he returns to private citizen
ship. SoHeres good luck to you, 
Mr. Hoover.
President Machado of Cuba is 
not having any too peaceful a time 
on his island republic off the coast 
of Florida. It seems as though an
other one of those revolts, so evi
dent in Cuba a few years back, is 
becoming evident. Unemployment 
is as bad in Cuba as elsewhere, de
spite the fact that men work for 
ten cents a day. The government 
has not been able to keep up the 
parks and streets and the blame 
is falling upon the president. His 
enemies are trying to force him 
out of office and there have been 
killings. Mr. Machado says that 
he would be glad to give up his of
fice but the people, his people, 
need him.

Why doesnt somebody give him a 
good pipe and some tobacco? For a 
pipe helps a man to think straight. Of 
course, its got to be the right tobacco. 
But any college man can guide him 
in that. A recent investigation showed 
Edgeworth, to be the favorite smoking 
tobacco at 1*2 out of 51t leading colleges.
Which is only naturalfor in all 
tobaccodom theres no blend like the 
mixture of fine old burleys found in 
Edgeworth. In that difference theres 
a new smoking satisfaction, a new 
comfort, for the man wlio likes to
think and dream with a pipe be
tween his teeth.
Buy Edgeworth anywhere in two
