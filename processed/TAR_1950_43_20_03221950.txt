Sophmore Class Organization 
Revived By Petition To SC
Dyer Leads Delegation To Rescind Council's Action; 
Proposal To Set Percentage For Voters Also Defeated
By Fred Sonnenberg
Grasping the dying embers of 
their class organization from the 
grave dug by Student Council, the 
sophomore class convinced councilmen that a 60 percent turnout 
at an election was not necessary 
to prove class interest; especially 
when Council only gets 27 per
cent of the student body out for 
its own election.
Lloyd Dyer led a body of soph
omores to last weeks meeting 
armed with 111 names on a peti
tion demanding Council hold an 
election this spring to elect of
ficers for the remainder of this 
school year and all of the next.
Two Resign
Councilmen demonstrated the 
intense interest present in their 
own organization by having to 
wait ten minutes to obtain a quornation of two members, John 
Steiner and Gerald Crowley.
Don Culler appeared before 
Council and submitted the new 
Delta Skull constitution for ap
proval. It was tabled for a week, 
but he managed to squeeze an 11 
to 9 vote of confidence so the hon
orary can meet until the constitu
tion is accepted.
Need Rally 
Leonard Smollen, chairman of 
Councils class reorganization 
committee who had the organiza
tion plan dropped last week be
cause of evident lack of interest, 
contended, Its a simpler matter 
to obtain 111 signatures on a pe
tition than to try to stir up inter
est for a representative election.

In Constitution
Members To Be Picked 
On Basis Of Activities, 
Upper Third Of Class
Presenting a new constitution to 
Student Council last Wednesday 
for approval, Delta Skull, junior 
mens activities honorary has in
corporated two new and import
ant revisions in their call system.
Foremost among the changes is 
the provision that candidates will 
be called from the upper one-third 
of their department. Previously 
there were no factor require
ments. The upper onethird will 
be determined on an average of 
the first three semester grades for 
all sophomores in each depart
ment.
The second important change 
affects the rule that requires all 
candidates to be participants in 
extra curricular activities. Previ
ously, only the type and number 
of activities were of importance in 
selecting members for the honor
ary. More paramount this year, 
however, will be the degree of 
participation and interest which 
a person displays towards an ac

Carnival Set To Satisfy Students
Spring Carnival

Circle in red May 12 and 13 on 
your social calendar. They are the 
dates of this years Spring Car

mittee chairman, Ted Goodson, 
this year it will follow the same 
general theme but in a new and 
satisfying way.
The committees foremost goal 
this year is to bring the price of 
tickets down to near beer-budget 
level . . . and still include all de
mands and whims of the student 
body.
Started In 1921
These spring time whims date 
back quite a few years in Car
negie history. In May of 1921 our 
campus heralded a three day 
round of social diversions called 
Campus Week. Dont be fool
ed by the name, however; it 
amounted to the same thing as 
Carnival . . . only more of it. They 
withstood the revelry for the three 
days instead of two.
At 1:00 on Thursday afternoon, 
May 13, there was a general as
sembly held at Carnegie Music 
Hall from which a parade launch
ed Carnival up Forbes street and 
onto the campus. During the en
suing three days familiar sound
ing events like the pushmobile 
race, queen coronations, and call 
day took place.
Brad Hunt To Play On Saturday
Brad Hunt and his orchestra 
will play for the King of Hearts 
dance this Saturday evening in

candidates for King of Hearts 
be present at the dance for the 
10:30 P.M. intermission.
An all-girl election will be 
held This Friday to determine 
this years King. APO is spon

event.
fice of the class president was an 
honor and nothing else. If one 
class would have a distinterested 
organization now, it would wreck 
the set-up of future classes. 
Smollen also thought the class 
should have a rally to determine 
the amount of interest present.
Interest Evident
A1 Moore tried to inject an 
amendment several times during 
the meeting requiring a certain 
percentage of the sophomore class 
to vote before the election would 
b valid. He started by asking for 
a 60 percent turnout. Fred Lunt 
amended the suggestion to read 
40 percent, and it was worked 
down to 35 percent before the 
whole proposal was defeated.
Claiming that every sophomore 
who signed the petition basked 
the organization movement, Art 
Christopher said enough interest 
was evident to warrant an elec
tion.
Sophomore Jeanne Bu .ton, 
chairman of the freshman regula
tions committee, said she had 
helped circulate the petition and 
noticed a great deal of spirit. Do
lores Mitchell, also a sophomore, 
had noticed considerable interest 
among the Margaret Morrison 
girls.
Fine Arts Snag
One of Councils visitors, Justin 
Davidson, a candidate for a class 
of 52 office, said he had been ap
proached by several students who 
asked him, Is Council really go
ing to do something about this 
petition, or will they kill it like 
they do the rest? Even the juniors 
are asking about our organiza
tion.
It was pointed out that the dele
gation of sophomores represented 
just E&S. The big difficulty in 
elections is getting the Fine Arts 
students behind the campaign. 
There was only one candidate 
for the vice-presidency of Fine 
Arts on the petitions turned in 
so far.
After hashing over the details 
of the proposal for 45 minutes 
and finally discovering who made 
the proposal in the first place, a 
vote was taken to rescind the ac
tion taken at the previous meet
ing. The sophomores got the 
green light to organize. 19-3.

2TAWAIVWEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 1950
Editorials
Chance orth Taking
Four sophomores appeared at Council last 
week to ask the governing body to reconsider 
the action taken the previous week which had 
killed all chances for a Class of 52 election this 
year. The plea was backed by a petition of over 
a hundred sophomores. After unsuccessfully 
probing for some method of insuring the good 
faith of the petitioners, Council, somewhat grudg
ingly and yet somewhat hopefully, approved an
other election for the class.
But now the sophomore class is definitely on 
the spot. They must produce a well unified 
and active class organization or seriously weak
en the entire organization plan. There will be 
many I told you sos at Council if the Class 
of 52 does not live up to its own aspirations.
If the Class of "52 does come out of itrs elec
tion with a strong class, however, it will add 
greatly to the organization of future classes. The 
next freshmen will see two classes before them 
and more naturally fall in line with the pro
gram.
The success of the election is the responsibility 
of both Council and those sophomores who signed 
the petition. Both must work together to publi
cize this election, help the class to its feet, and 
start the feet moving in the right direction.
Along another line, we wish to commend 
Council for the manner in which the petition 
was handled last Wednesday. It had ample 
reason to be cautious before approving another 
election. If the class becomes a dud after or
ganization, the entire reorganization plan will 
be weakened. No stipulations could be found 
that would provide a guarantee against this 
happening, however, and approval was finally 
given.
One Councilman made us very unhappy after 
the voting was over. He bemoaned the fact that 
the action implied Council had made a mistake 
the week before in cancelling the election. To 
this councilman we wish to point out that it is 
much better to admit mistakes and correct them 
rather than let them remain mistakes.
Mistaken
Several weeks ago we criticized the Class of 
?53 for their lack of activity. From the news
letter to the class in the adjoining column it 
appears that we were mistaken in condemning 
the entire class. The officers have been active, 
but has been hindered by a complete lack of funds 
in sponsoring any activity that would include the 
entire class. Now that Student Council has agreed 
to underwrite the class dance, we hope to see the 
situation remedied by a 100 percent turnout at 
the social affair.
Good Luck
Elsewhere in this issue the election of a 
new Tartan editorial board is announced. For 
many reasons we regret that our year is over. 
We feel we have done our best to make the 
paper informative, entertaining, constructive, 
and, most important, unbiased. Still we made 
many mistakes and did not accomplish all the 
improvements we planned when vie assumed 
our duties.
The new staff, however, has had much more 
experience than we had had when we began at 
this time last year. We believe the student body 
can expect an improved paper during the com
ing year. We wish the best of luck to the new 
staff.

First Since 1936
The officers held a few meetings, but little 
was accomplished. What were the officers to do? 
There hadnt been any since 1936 and no one 
seemed to have a good solution. The problem was 
even more difficult because a treasury was non
existent.
Cwens and Scimitars gave the officers the re
sponsibility of enforcing the traditions exam regu
lations. Personal reminders were sent to the 150 
freshmen who had not taken the exam; and when 
the exam was given again, the black list was al
most obliterated.
NEWSY NEWS . . . The Tartan broke into the Pittsburgh 
Press March 15. The Press car
ried a feature on the inquiring 
reporter question, What do Pitt 
students think of Tech? The
vealed, because the election was declared null 
and void. When the re-election was held, the 
number voting was decidedly less. A week after 
the results were announced, the officers were or
ientated at a special meeting of the class reorgani
zation committee.
The vice-presidents of each college conducted 
an election to select their advisory councils, which 
were to consist of a representative from each de
partment.
Conducted Survey
Class organization now reached into every de
partment of the three colleges. Dean David asked 
the officers if they could conduct a survey of the 
members of the class to reveal their opinions of 
the freshman orientation program. With the aid 
of the advisory boards opinions were obtained 
from a scattered group of freshmen.
No further duties came to the attention of the 
officers at their regular Tuesday meetings, and 
they took it upon themselves to create some. 
They decided to sponsor a class function in which 
all the 600 freshmen could participate.
The plans had to be sanctioned by the Dean 
of Men, the Dean of Women, and Student Coun
cil. Money had to be voted by Council. Thistle 
Hall had to be obtained, arrangements for a 
band made, etc. It took several weeks to make 
these arrangements but it is now definite that 
the 53 Borgan Party will be held.
Friday, April 14, has been set aside for the 
'53 Borgan Party. Tickets will be available to 
freshmen at 60 cents per person. Numerous forms 
of entertainment will be presented during the 
evening and the band will play until 12 p.m.

Under the direction of Ted Goodson the class 
reorganization committee drafted a constitution 
to govern the proposed organization. When the 
election notices went up, over 30 candidates vied 
for the six available positions. After a week of 
intensive campaigning the polls were opened and

34 per cent while Mike Theodore 
ranked second in foul shooting at 
64 per cent.
The Tartans registered 30 per 
cent of their shots to their oppo
nents 28 per cent. They only 
notched 61 per cent of the free 
throws, however, to trail the op
position by one per cent.
The local squad also managed 
to out-foul their rivals. Here, 
though, the margin was a sub
stantial 33 with the Tartans aver
aging 23 fouls per game.

Mike Theodore Joins Ranks 
Of Carnegie Basketball Greats
Mike Theodore, one of Carne
gies all-time basketball greats, 
will soon bid his alma mater 
adieu. The chemical engineering 
senior has led the Plaid on the 
basketball court ever since he 
came to CIT in 1944. Mike thinks 
that his biggest thrill in playing 
college ball was his debut with 
the Tartans.
That first game, with Grove 
City, saw the 6'2" Theodore gar
nering 15 points which seemed 
like a lot of points. Mike totaled 
118 points that year, playing in 
only 10 contests. In four cam
paigns the Wilmerding flash to
taled a record 1049 points in 83 
games.
The 1947-48 season Big Mike 
tallied 269 points and was select
ed captain of the Plaid squad, a | 
post he has held for the past three 
years. Hitting his peak form in | 
the 1948-49 season, Mike scored 
324 points in 21 games. In the 
Bradley Tech game, Mike hit the | 
hoop for 24 points. After the con
test the Bradely mentor compli
mented Theodore on his pivot 
man duties with the remark that 
Mike was the best center weve 
run up against all season.

rm C  ri n i finalists in the round robin tour-IM Rifle Records 
Fall In Semi-Final 
RoundCompetition
Last Wednesday was a good day 
for new record scores in IM rifle 
competition. ATO No. 1 won the 
semi-finals match 968x1200, bet
tering the previous team record of 
957x1200 fired by SAE in 1948.
Ralph Snyder of SAE set a new 
kneeling record of 91x100, a one 
point margin over the mark set 
last year by Joe Halliday of Sigma 
Nu. Joe Lux of Beta Theta Pi tied 
the prone record with a 99x100. 
Poe of ATOs 1949 champions set 
this mark last year.
Second and third in the semi
finals were the Betas (955x1200) 
and SAE (902x1200). The three 
teams will compete in the finals 
match today to determine the 
school championship.
ney. Both teams were out to pro
tect the records at stake, and the 
match was even closer than the 
score indicates. .In the first set, 
Allen of the Dukes downed PiKAs 
Mike Costa in three straight 
games, 21-14, 21-17, 21-10, to put 
the Dukes out in front. The next 
match saw former school champ, 
Dick DiPrima go .down before 
Dukes Martin Geller 3-2 after 
taking the first two games 22-20, 
21-19. As in the match with the 
Tau Delts, Geller found himself 
only after losing the first two 
games.
With two games already won 
and only one more win needed, 
the Dorm men prepared to walk 
off with the title. This was not to 
happen however, as PiKAs Tom 
Fidance set down Milton DeJean 
in three straight games, 21-17, 21- 
15, 21-18, to break the match wide 
open again. Dick Bailey sent Dick 
Emmer down in a close 3-2 set 
to force the match into the dou

Plaid Riflemen 
Meet Pitt For 
District Title
Smith Paces Tartans 
In Win Over Duquesne
Carnegie Techs improved rifle 
team will meet the University of 
Pittsburgh sharpshooters tomor
row afternoon in a match that will 
determine the district champion
ship. A Tartan victory would 
cause a deadlock between the two 
teamS and necessitate a playoff to 
decide the winner of the five-team 
league.
At present the Plaid marksmen 
trail only the Panthers, and rank 
above Duquesne, California State 
Teachers, and W&J. Coached by 
M/Sgt. E. R. Reed, the Skibos 
have posted an increasingly high
er team score with each match 
this year and rate a good chance 
of defeating the favored Panthers.
In a March 10 match with Du
quesne, the Tartan riflemen had 
little trouble outshooting last 
years national champions, winning 
by a 1376-1297 margin. Pete 
Smith, consistently the teams high 
scorer, posted a 279 total for top 
honors.
John Bachofer fired a 276 
against the Dukes, followed by 
John Monstream and John Kolbe, 
each with 274 marks. Bob Power 
rounded out the first five, firing 
a 273. 
Tomorrows match with Pitt 
gains added importance when it 
is considered that the league win
ner will compete for the state title.
The Architects, playing their 
third game in the tournament, 
claimed a 37-28 victory over the 
Dorm Dukes and a narrow deci
sion of 33-31 over Beta Theta Pi 
in the semi-finals.
Emanon, drawing a bye in the 
first round, scalped Kappa Sigma 
46-20 in the semi-finals. The Kap
pa Sigs previously squeezed by the 
Sigma Nu five 15-12 in a rough 
and tumble game in which one 
quarter showed only three points 
being scored by both teams.
Emanon moved ahead of the 
Architects early in the opening 
minutes of the game and held the 
lead several times before the Ar
chitects quintet moved out in front 
to lead 13-11 at the end of the 
first period.
In the second quarter Emanon 
remained behind as the fast-mov
ing Architects advanced their lead 
by four points and then dropped 
to a 21-17 lead at the end of the 
half.
Emanon exploded in the first 
minute of the third period with 
two field goals and two free 
throws, erasing their four point 
deficit and advancing them two 
points ahead. Fighting back, the 
Architects again took the lead but 
seconds later Emanon rallied with 
eight points as the defending 
champions lost their advantage.
Entering the final quarter with 
a 35-31 lead, Emanon remained 
in control of the game, outscoring 
I the desperately fighting Architects 
| by three points to win the much 
j sought school crown.
Ralph Burt of the Architects 
took the honors lor high scoring 
; in the playoff tournament with a 
I total of 41 points in the three 
games. High point honors in the 
final game went to Marty Chetlin 
who totaled 15 points.

TA4OTfc%rVWEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 1950^
Inquiring
IUk|Hrlcr
Carnegie students are not too 
concerned about Pitts opinion of 
them, the inquiring reporter dis
covered as she haunted Skibo in 
search of an incensed Techite to 
ask, What do Tech students think 
of Pitt?
Joseph Kruk, freshman: My girl 
goes there for 
night classes. 
There is too 
much noise and 
c o n f u sion at 
Pitt; its a little 
crowded there. 
Pitt students 
should study 
more. Im told 
Pitt's a good 
place to go if 
you dont want to work. Our col
leges get along well enough as far 
as Im concerned. Their team is 
not much better than ours either. 
Jim Alemany, sophomore: Fie on 
Pitt! I make an effort not to think 
about their ,
football team, 
but they have a 
basketball team 
youd expect 
from a h i g 1 
school. I dont 
think the rela
tions between 
our schools 
should be im
proved. Why 
should we be brothers with Pitt? 
Pitt students have rocks in their 
heads for liking to eat at Skibo. 
I had a good time at that rally 
last year; this year I was hungry 
and didn't go. Those joint rallies 
suggested wouldn't go over unless 
both colleges were in the right 
mood.
Bootsie Stevenson, junior: The
school rooms are so large. There 
is no personal contact. It is like 
a n assembly 
line. At Pitt 
there is too 
much emphasis 
o n football. I 
dont think 
there are really 
bad relations 
between Pitt 
and Tech. Peo
ple try to make 
it seem that 
way because they think it is cute 
and because it is a tradition to be 
against Pitt. I think Pitt is a 
jumbled-up mess. The Cathedral 
is a beautiful building, but it 
should be in a different place. In 
the Tuck Shop there are definite 
cliches. Pitt just thinks we are 
unfriendly so they wouldnt go 
50-50.
Jean Miller, senior: I think its 
a fine idea to have beer parties 
on the cut. I y.- ' s '3
dont agree that 
Tech is un
friendly. The 
students in the 
two colleges 
should see more 
of each other.
I dont like the 
idea of having 
classrooms i n 
one building.
For one thing the classes are too 
large. Pitt is too big to have a 
friendly atmosphere except in the 
Tuck Shop where the cliches on 
campus eat. Their scholastic record 
is nothing to brag about. Their 
degree doesnt mean as much as 
ours does. I think Tech should 
follow Pitts football policy. We 
de-emphasize it too much. Pitt has 
more school spirit than we do. 
So there!
Scimitars And 
Cwens Sponsor

For those engineers who spend 
their evenings jn<MH 102, the en

their disposal. Here again al
though the lighting could be im
proved, the comfortable old oaken 
chairs and the smoke-mellowed

fluorescent lighting, a sound ab

level, approximately one and onehalf times higher than before, will 
greatly decrease the eye strain.

this room should receive a much 
better attendance than it is at

neer from persual of his loved 
studies, the overall light level has 
again been greatly improved. The 
many tables and new comfortable 
chairs are a boon to the weary 
and an incentive to the eager. 
Also, it has been noted that in the 
evening hours, the several chargeout desks are in the capable hands 
of two very pretty young ladies. 
It might be worthwhile for the in
dustrious student to arrive early 
(it assures one a parking space) 
and make good use of the main li

SDP Members 
To Approve 
New Pledges
On Saturday evening March 25, 
Sigma Delta Phi, fraternity is 
having a social evening at the 
Carnegie Union. At this get-to
gether the pledges will be present
ed to the attending members for 
recognition and approval.
This will be one of the few 
meetings of the year to which the 
fairer sex will be invited. Tak
ing past events of thi kind as ex
amples it is expected that there 
will be a full house and that a 
good time will be had by all.
The pledges accepted at this so
cial meeting will be initiated at 
the April 16, meeting. Sigma Delta 
Phi, through the efforts of its 
present ambitious members and 
its aspiring pledges, is once again 
attaining the recognition and 
standing it enjoyed before the 
slow down in campus activity 
caused by World War II.

News
And
ViewsMajor Roy Car/son, (/.of/owa, 
lraining Executive, (/.$. dir forcef
We almost didnt make the issue 
with our news and views this 
week, but the fault was with the 
weather, and not with our inten
tions. At one instance last Friday 
(on way to Plaid Office) we found 
ourself in ankle deep water. We 
could rattle on about. the hows 
and wherefores that preceded this 
sad state of affairs, but our Edi
tor insists we do our crying out 
of print so we will just have to 
carry this sorrow silently. (Ed: 
This is not paper toweling he is 
writing on).
As mentioned in past columns 
of News and Views, Charles Kel
ler and LeRoy Rowland, cochairmen of the 35th Annual En
gineering and Science banquet, 
have done a grand job in organiz
ing the banquet plans, and at this 
printing they promise a grand af
fair for the Evening Students, 
and their friends. They vehement
ly insist that the Engineers who 
miss this banquet will be doing 
themselves a grave injustice.
Those fine decorations for the 
Evening Student Council sc miformal dance were the work of 
Ray Schwalm and his decorating 
committee.
Speaking of the semi-formal 
dance we must acknowledge that 
Mr. McKelway has once again 
sold the greatest number of tick
ets. The number of students who 
attended the dance was a fine in
dication that the evening school 
students want these affairs and 
Council should hold one semiformal dance each year.
The editing of the Evening 
School Handbook for the school 
year 1950-51 will be the task oi 
Charles Keller, and Miss Martha 
Latza. Council has made a wise 
choice in making Martha and 
Chuck co-editors, and evening
