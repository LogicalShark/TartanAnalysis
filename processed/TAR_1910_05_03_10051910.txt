CARNEGIE TECH 0
Carnegie Techs football season opened when the 
Plaid played a 00 tie with Waynesburg College 
last Saturday. The weather was much too warm 
for a really good exhibition, but in spite of this 
handicap both teams played snappy ball. The teams 
were evenly matched, although Tech slightly out
played her opponents. On several occasions fumbling 
and( penalties prevented touchdowns that were al
most a certainty. Both teams were unfortunate in 
this respect. At one time Waynesburg had the ball 
on Techs 3-yard line only to lose it on a fumble, 
while at another time Tech had the ball on Waynesburgs 8-yard line but lost it through her inability to 
stick to the pigskin.
The game was divided into four quarters of ten 
minutes each. Between the first and second and the 
third and fourth was an intermission of three min
utes, while the rest between the second and third 
was of ten minutes duration. This slowed up the 
game considerably, time being called twice when a 
touch down seemed but a question of seconds.
The changes in the rules brought out several new 
plays, the most noticeable of which was the quarter
back plunge through center. Captain Hatcher work
ed this play for good gains several times. Tech also 
worked the forward pass successfully two times out 
of three. Waynesburg did not attempt the play at 
all. In the final quarter Tech was penalized be
cause Hatcher hurled the ball beyond the twentyyard limit in making a forward pass. Tech also tried 
the onside kick twice, failing once and making a 
good gain on the other occasion. In the kicking de
partment Tech far outclassed Waynesburg. Hull 
averaged over 30 yards, while Waynesburg lost 10 
yards, on one punt and sent another out of bounds
5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.
WAYNESBURG 0
Hull, Hatcher, Taylor and Dyer starred for Tech. 
The latter was playing one of the best defensive 
games ever seen on the Tech field when he injured 
his shoulder. When Padden of Waynesburg received 
the kick-off at the start of the game and got away 
from the field for a 35-yard run, Dyer made his way 
through a line of almost impregnable interference 
and pulled down his man after a sensational sprint. 
In several instances Dewey caught the runner 
for a 5 to 10 yard loss. Taylor, Hatcher and Hull 
did good work in advancing the ball. Hatcher was 
in every play, both on the defensive and offensive. 
He gained steadily, both through the center and 
around the ends. He ran back punts in fine style 
and kept right after his men every moment of play. 
Hull made big gains through the line and around the 
end. Taylors best gains were made just outside of 
tackle. He played hard and consistently throughout 
the game.
For Waynesburg, Padden at tackle, and Biddle at 
half did the best work. Both got away for good runs 
around Techs left end and both played a good de
fensive game. Hoge also showed up well in the lat
ter respect. The plays on which Waynesburg made 
the greatest gains, were swinging end runs in which 
either the tackle or the halfback carried the ball. 
They also made good gains through the guards and 
tackles.
The officials were lenient in their decisions. Play 
was stopped a couple of times to interpret the rules 
but the questions were quickly and satisfactorily 
settled. The majority of penalties were inflicted for 
offside play and interference, although one Waynes
burg player, Porter, drew a 15-yard penalty for 
crawling with the ball. The officials seemed to have 
some difficulty in interpreting the rule which says

Class Scrap. An exciting moment in the sack rush.
that an onside kick must go at least twenty yards be
yond the line of scrimmage, several arguments 
arising over this play. However, considering the 
many changes in the rules, many of them none too 
clear, the officials handled the game well.
The Waynesburg game was Techs formal intro
duction to new football and Coaches Dowling and 
McCulloh express entire satisfaction at the outcome 
of Saturdays clash. The first few weeks of foot
ball this year will be necessarily largely experi
mental. However, Dowlings head is buzzing with 
new plays and formations and after a weeks prac
tice, Carnegie men will be in good, fighting trim. 
Techs next game is with State College, October 8th, 
when we travel across the state to meet the Center 
county lads. .The result of next Saturdays game will 
be watched with great interest, not only by Tech men 
but by other teams who will meet the two institu
tions later in the season.
The Game in Detail.
First Quarter.
Tech won the toss and chose the south end of the 
field. Hull kicked to the 35-yard line, Clutter run
ning it back 10 yards. Acklin gained 5 yards but 
Dyer caught Parkinson for no gain. Biddle failed to 
make the distance around Blanchard and it became 
Techs ball on Waynesburgs 40-yard line. Taylor 
made 10 yards outside of tackle, but on the next play, 
Tech was penalized for offside play. Taylor then 
carried the ball to the 25-yard line. Hatcher again 
made it first down but Waynesburg braced and took 
the ball on their 20-yard line, stopping Hull, Schneid
er and Taylor in succession.
Padden then carried the ball to the center of the
field, Dyer making a brilliant tackle. On the next 
play Dyer nailed Lippincott for a 10-yard loss. Ack
lin went through the line to the center of the field 
and then kicked to the 25-yard line, Hatcher taking 
the ball. Hull lost 2 yards and on the next play Tech 
fumbled and when the heap was untangled a Waynes
burg man was found lying on theball on Techs 14- 
yard line. Padden went 8 yards and then 3 more 
through the line, making it first down. Waynesburg 
then fumbled on Techs 3-yard mark and Tech re
covered the ball. Critchlow was then substituted for 
Gilkinson. Hull went to the 6-yard line and Taylor 
rushed it 10 more. Time was then called for the 
first quarter.
Second Quarter.
After the three minute intermission the teams 
changed sides, the ball going to Tech on her 15- 
yard line as it had been when play was stopped. 
Hatcher made 3 yards around Parkinson and Taylor
5 through Ross. The ball was fumbled on the next 
play but Tech regained the ball and made first down. 
Hull slipped through right tackle for 1 yard and 
Hatched carried it to the 39-yard mark around the 
right end of Waynesburgs line. Hull and Schneider 
took it 6 yards farther. Hatcher again went around 
Parkinson for 10 yards from a kick formation. Hull 
gained 4 yards but on the next play Tech received a 
penalty of 5 yards for offside play. Hull then punted 
to Waynesburgs 30-yard line and Dyer downed the 
back before he could advance a foot. Biddle went 
around Dyer for 8 yards, the latter then leaving the 
game on account of a hurt shoulder. Blanchard went 
in at end. Lippincott barely made first down through 
the line. Biddle went around Blanchard for 5 yards,

but when Biddle tried the same hole he failed to 
gain. Ross punted, the ball falling 15 yards in his 
rear where Padden recovered it. A dispute occurred 
at this point, the officials finally declaring it Waynesburgs ball and first down. Hull stopped Biddle after 
he had gained 2 yards and a Waynesburg player was 
penalized 15 yards. From there Ross punted out of 
bounds at the 20-yard line. Hull gained 8 yards 
through Ross and Tech was penalized for offside 
play. Taylor failed to get past the line and when 
time was called, Hull was back for an attempt to 
kick a field goal.
Third Quarter.
Ross kicked off to Critchlow and he carried it to 
the 35-yard mark. From there Hull punted over 
Porters head to Waynesburgs 35-yard line where the 
back was tackled as soon as he had picked up the 
ball. Porter crawled with the ball and the referee 
placed it on Waynesburgs 20-yard line as a penalty. 
Schmucker caught Biddle for a 10-yard loss and Ross 
kicked to Hull on the 40-yard line. Taylor made two 
3-yard gains and Hatcher went through Hage for 6 
more. It was then first down on the 28-yard line. 
Hull counted 3 yards through Padden. Baume was 
then substituted for Schneider. Hatcher lost 5 yards 
in two tries and the ball was Waynesburgs on their 
30-yard line. Biddle advanced the ball to the center 
of the field by a beautiful run. The ball again went 
to Biddle and he fumbled but recovered it on their 
35-yard line. When Ross punted on the next play, 
Schmucker dropped in front of an end and Tech was 
penalized 20 yards. This made it first down with 
the ball at the center of the field. Parkinson failed 
to gain around Schmucker but Biddle made 2 yards 
at the game end. Ross then kicked to Hull on the
30-yard line. On the next play Hull punted to Way
nesburgs 35-yard line. Biddle made 11 yards 
through tackle and then lost a yard. Hull, by a bril
liant tackle, stopped Biddle for a loss of 10 yards. 
Ross went back for a kick but fumbled the pass and 
Tech recovered the ball on Waynesburgs 23-yard 
line. Hull gained 3 yards and Baume was tackled for 
no gain. Here the quarter ended.
Fourth Quarter.
At the beginning of this quarter Acheson entered 
the game in place of Blanchard. Hatcher made 5 
yards but as it was third down and 7 yards to gain 
the ball became Waynesburgs on her 15-yard line. 
Clutter gained two yards around Acheson and Acklin 
made 4 yards at the same end. Ross then punted 
out of bounds on the 40-yard line. Hatcher attempted 
a forward pass but lost 5 yards. He then drove be
tween center and guard for 4 yards. Hull punted to 
the 32-yard line. This was by far the shortest punt 
he made. After Biddle and Acklin had lost 2 yards 
trying to find a hole at center, Ross punted to 
Hatcher on the fifty yard mark. Red, by a splen
did run, brought it back 20 yards. Hull failed to 
gain and Hatcher again tried a forward pass. This 
time it was blocked but was recovered for a gain of
2 yards. Hull then fumbled the ball but picked it up 
and gained 8 yards around Clutter. Taylor carried 
it to the 15-yard line and Baume and Hull failed to 
gain the necessary distance. Waynesburg received 
the ball on her 7-yard line and kicked to Hatcher on 
the 53-yard line. On the next play Schmucker made 
14 yards on a pretty forward pass. Here the game 
ended with the ball in Techs possession on the 39- 
yard line. The line-up;

GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUB.
Notice for New Men.
All new students, who have had any experience in 
singing with church choirs, church quartets or so
cieties, glee clubs or choral societies of any kind, 
and fellows who can strum a mandolin, banjo, guitar 
or any stringed instrument are most cordially urged 
to try out for the Glee and Mandolin Clubs. A fellow 
who knows how to do stunts or can both sing and 
play an instrument stands a very good show of mak
ing the clubs.
It is earnestly desired by the management, that 
the make up of the clubs shall be truly representative 
of the best there is in that line, in the school. For 
that reason every man who thinks he is capable 
should try out.
We have been unusually fortunate in procuring di
rectors for both clubs that are of the first quality. 
Mr. Scalzo, director of the Mandolin Club, is a mem
ber of the Pittsburgh Orchestra and a mandolin 
virtuoso of International repute. He has not only 
led a large mandolin club in Leipsic, Germany, but 
has made two tours of the South American Republics. 
He is well known in all musical circles in this coun
try and is rated as one of the four best mandolin 
players in the world.
Mr. Robert F. McDowell, leader of the Glee Club, 
has been with W. & J., and for four years was the 
tenor soloist of Princeton Glee Club. He has had 
large experience with College Glee Clubs and knows 
the kind of entertainment that is expected. His per
sonality has done much to cement the fellowship in 
the organizations with which he has been previously 
associated.
To be able to sing or play under the directorship 
of either of these men is an opportunity of rare find
ing and the instruction that will be received will be 
worth considerable to the individual men.
We have assurance already of several extended 
tours to be taken by the clubs during the vacations. 
Any one who has ever traveled with a college glee 
and mandolin club knows what jolly good fun it is,
The second try out will be held Wednesday, Oc
tober 5, in the Assembly Hall of the A. & J. building 
at 5 p. m. At this time the names, positions, etc., 
of the candidates will be taken and the policy out
lined.
The annual Pittsburgh concert will be held in 
Carnegie Music Hall, Tuesday, March 28, 1911.
L. H. Button,
THE COMMONS.
Since the last issue of the Tartan the school com
mons have been opened for the year. Cooked food 
has at last replaced the box lunches and the student 
and faculty alike are happy. The manager for the 
coming year is Mr. R. J. Grant. That he is fully 
competent to cater to the wishes of his patrons may 
be expected from the fact that he has had three 
years experience, at the University of Pittsburgh, 
where he at present conducts two establishments 
similar to the one at Tech. When interviewed by a 
Tartan representative he stated that it was his in
tention to pay special attention to the wants of the 
student body, as they were the ones for whom the 
commons were established.
The Cafateae system of serving will be the one in 
use. This system was originated in San Francisco 
and is said to be the quickest and most orderly yet 
devised. A passage wide enough for one runs along 
the counter. At the entrance each customer takes 
a tray and selects such food as he likes. At the 
other end is stationed the cashier. This entirely 
prevents pushing and crowding.
All food will be prepared in the kitchen adjoin
ing the lunch room. The ban has fallen on pies and 
other pastry received from outside sources. Here
after they will be cooked on the premises by a skill
ful chef under the eye of the manager. Mr. Grant 
extends a cordial invitation to come and inspect the 
place. He also states that all suggestions will be 
gratefully received.
Glee Club tryout and rehearsal Wednesday after
noon at 4 oclock, A. & J. Assembly Hall. Mandolin 
Club tryout and rehearsal Thursday afternoon at 4 
oclock, A. & J. Assembly Hall. Bring instruments; 
tenors and guitars especially needed.

Chorus:
A noble life; a useful one;
That shall have'much of service done;
May this one purpose always be.
To make mankind more glad, more free:
To make the home a place of rest 
Where peace and happiness abound;
And where the heart is ever blest,
And all loves sweetest joys are found.
Where there is sorrow, there to find 
Our greatest joy in doing good;
In trying to uplift mankind,
We shall exalt true womanhood.
So let us live that we may see

Then, we may know that life will be

The Senior class held its election this past week 
with the following result: President, Sarah Nobin; 
vice president, Luretia Kemple; secretary, Rebecca 
Shiras; treasurer, Anna Green. The class extends 
to them a hearty welcome.
The Junior officers are as follows: President,
Genevieve Cushwa; vice president ,Edna Moorehead; 
treasurer, Loma McIntosh; secretary, Dorothy Sav
age. The class wishes them a successful term.
The tennis tournament has been held back by the 
condition of the court; but drawings have been made 
and, weather permitting, the event will come off 
this week.
The Glee and Dramatic Club will be organized 
soon. Think it over, girls, and help to make these 
clubs, the best ever.
Good work Juniors! There is no doubt that all the 
classes fully appreciated the edict establishing a new 
capillature arrangement. Some of the Plebes have 
beautiful hair and it certainly showed to good advant
age hanging down the back with a green ribbon bow. 
If the Juniors continue to be go progressive, their 
class will make its mark,
INCIDENTS.
By Wee MacGreegor.
A dozen bold, bad and very naughty rah-rah boys 
from a neighboring university paid Tech a visit 
about eleven oclock Wednesday evening. They 
brought with them a plentiful supply of paste and 
a large stack of nice, new Freshman Posters. 
Wicked were their designs. They were going to be 
real devilish. College traditions must be upheld. 
They would paste nice big red, white and black
signs all over the face of the Tech School build
ings and show the world just how daring real col
lege chaps can be. Then, as in the olden fables, 
something happened.
A lonely Techite was hurrying home from school 
and spied a bunch of whispering, gesticulating 
boys. Coming closer his eyes were opened by the 
sight of a newly-pasted poster staring at him from 
the face of the barn. He promptly removed the 
offending notice. Coming closer, he accosted the 
mischievous ones, chided them for their wanton
ness, and was rewarded by having bricks shied at
him. He then hastened for help.
Fifteen minutes later, the wild and wooley wear
ers of loud hose were captured, that is, six of them 
were. Sigma Tau and Woodlawn had emptied in a 
twinkling when the alarm was turned in and it 
didnt take long for the vigilance committee to 
get busy. First, all of the posters were pulled 
down. This was easy, as the paste had not yet 
dried. Then the trembling culprits, now very weak 
and apologetic, were taken down to the engine-room 
where they were branded with an unctious coating 
of black grease and their own paste. After being 
given a severe lecture on the folly of departing 
from the path of righteousness, they were kindly 
but firmly requested to make amends for their mis
deeds by giving a series of Carnegie cheers. They 
were then turned loose a sadder but immensely 
more sapient bunch of college boys. Rah, rah, rah!
Sophomores were victorious in class-rushes at Le
high.

There is a story told of an old Jew who was cross
ing the ocean in a big liner. When the vessel had 
been out of port two days, she struck a reef in the 
midst of a fog and knocked a big hole in her hull. 
An excited sailor thrust his head in the door-way 
of the Hebrews cabin and shouted: The ships 
sinking! The ships sinking! The Jew did not 
move. Say, bellowed the sailor, crazily, Do you 
hear me say that the ship is sinking? Let her 
sink, answered the old man unconcernedly, she 
doesnt belong to me.
The anecdote is an old one, but it has a singularly 
appropriate application to the attitude which is 
taken by some Tech men. Carnegie Tech is like a 
good ship, carrying its freight of twenty-three hun
dred students through the seas of inexperience and 
ignorance. She is not sinking nor is there any in
dication of breakers ahead. But she would never 
forge to the front so fast nor run so smoothly if all 
of her sons assumed the dont-care attitude of the 
oid Jew. Reefs would soon appear on the horizon 
and the public would cease to marvel at her' pro
gress. What is the answer? you query. The solu
tion to the problem lies within yourselves. The 
ship does belong to you, and it is up to you to do 
all you can to keep her running. If her reputation 
pales you are the loser. Then how can I help 
Tech? you ask. There are many, many ways.
Carnegie Tech has enjoyed a reputation for put
ting out athletic teams of sterling worth. To do 
this requires the help and work of every man in 
Tech. Come out for the foot-ball team or the base
ball team or the basket-ball team. If you cant play 
the games, come out and learn them. You will find 
every man willing to give you a lift. The Tech 
Glee Club has issued a call for candidates. Can 
you sing? Dont know? Then hustle around to the 
try-outs and see what you can do. The Glee Club 
is going to make several extensive trips this winter, 
and in order to sustain the Carnegie standard of 
excellence, must have a cracking, good chorus. Per
haps you are just the man that is needed to fill out 
a quartette or to make up a certain part. The Tech 
Band is in need of new men. If you can play an 
instrument, here is a chance to show your spirit. 
Tech needs you. In a few months the White Friars 
will begin to rehearse a new play. If you are in
terested in that sort of work get right after a place 
in the cast or chorus and help make the show a 
good one. If you are inclined toward journalistic 
work, get out and do something for the Tartan. 
Hand in those little news items and jokes or that 
little bit of verse which you wrote the other day. 
But no matter what you do, do something!
You owe Tech a great deal. From her halls you 
are gleaning knowledge and light which will be 
worth thousands of dollars to you later in life. Get 
out and try to show your gratitude and appreciation 
for the benefits you are receiving. Do something 
which will lift up the Carnegie banner in the eyes 
of the public, something that will make her better 
and bigger. Then you will have accomplished 
something worth while.

MASS MEETING.
A mass meeting of the Science and Design Schools 
was held last Wednesday in order to prepare for 
the Waynesburg game. Dr. Savage was first intro
duced by Chairman McCorkle. He gave a brief talk 
on the duty of the student body in regard to sup
porting the team. Physical Director McCulloch and 
Coach Dowling were then called upon and both re
sponded with good, hearty man-to-man addresses. 
Following the foot-ball talks, Mr. McDowell, the new 
Glee Club Director, was introduced. He spoke 
briefly upon the Glee Club and its relation to the 
students. After the speeches were over, a Cheer 
Leader from the Science School was elected. Guy 
Hecker came cut victorious in the balloting and is 
now the official rah-rah conductor. The Design 
School and the Industrial School will also elect 
Cheer Leaders later on, a vote being taken on the 
question. After trying out the new leaders on a 
series of Carnegie yells, the meeting was adjourned.

The fiscal year for the Tartan has just opened. We 
want the girls of the M. M. C. S. to take an interest 
in their part of the paper. Dont complain that our 
school is not recognized as it should be, but write 
such fine articles for the paper that merit will gain 
recognition for us. We hope to have a system ar
ranged so that every class and every part of each 
class will have some definite thing to do. So awake 
your senses so that you may the better judge 
whether or not the Tartan is to be a credit and help 
to the school or merely a nominal publication.

On Wednesday, November 2d, will be given a 
prize for the best composition rendered in the 
Course in Illustration since the beginning of this 
year.

TRADE SCHOOLS IN THE DOMINION.
Canada is making noteworthy advance in trade 
education. The Royal Commission appointed some 
months ago to investigate the subject of technical 
education in the Dominion, began its sessions late in 
July in Ottawa and at several points in Nova Scotia. 
The commission is authorized to visit any portion 
of the world to secure information. It will travel 
from one end of the country to the other, examining 
into the needs, the equipment and the industrial 
methods of the provinces. Then it will visit the 
technical schools of the United States, and later pro
ceed to Europe. The Dominion has already a num
ber of technical schools of high efficiency, notably in 
Winnipeg, and at Kingston and Berlin in Ontario. 
McGill University at Montreal has several excellent 
engineering schools. Canada also has a number of 
agricultural institutions that are doing splendid 
work, among them the Guelph and MacDonald Col
lege near Montreal. Nova Scotia, however, is the 
only one of the provinces that has organized a sys
tem of technicalschools supported by the state. In 
this province there are trade schools for miners, for 
stationary engineers, and for other occupations, in
cluding those of fishermen. The province also main
tains a technical college of university rank, teaching 
mining, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. 
Already, it is claimed, the efficiency of the miningschool is shown in the low death and accident rate 
among the miners of Nova Scotia as compared with 
the rates in other mining communities. It is inter
esting to note that the appointment of the Royal Com
mission to make this investigation was urged by both 
the Canadian Manufacturers Association and the 
Dominion Trade and Labor Congress. The chairman 
of the commission is Dr. James W. Robertson, whose 
notable contributions to agricultural and industrial 
education while he was Dominion Commission of 
Agriculture and Dairying, were made familiar to our 
readers in the Review for November, 1907.Review

COLLEGE FOOT BALL.
The foot-ball season has opened in most of the 
colleges and although very little can be predicted 
from the first few games, some things are apparent 
to those who follow the game closely. New foot
ball is receiving a rigorous test and in the great 
majority of cases has passed creditably. The game 
is more open than before; the chance of injury ap
pears to be lessened. Whether or not the latter is 
true can be better told later in the season. The 
game is one for the individual. One-man plays will 
abound. Head work will win more games this year 
than brawn. The successful team will be the one 
which can out-guess and out-trick its opponents. 
Although beef and strength are still valuable as
sets, speed and accuracy will be the big factor in 
winning games. The forward-pass, although it has 
been little used in the early season games, will cer
tainly develop as the weeks pass. One feature of 
the new rules has not come up to expectations. The 
division of time into four quarters instead of two 
halves, as formerly, is a handicap rather than an 
improvement. Foot-ball is a game which requires 
good, red blood, heated to the point where men ex
ert the best in them. The calling of time in the 
midst of halves generally stops the game at the 
most interesting point, allows the mens blood to 
cool down and when play is resumed the game be
comes listless and slow. Besides, the players really 
gain little rest from the brief respite. The specta
tors do not like the breaking-up of the game be
cause it makes the play slow and tends to curb en
thusiasm when it runs highest. The most exciting 
moments of any foot-ball game are always near the 
- end of the halves. By the new ruling, the periods 
of play are too short to bring events to a climax 
which will fire the audience with tumultuous ardor. 
It is freely predicted that the ruling will be changed 
back to the old two-half way before the season is 
ended. The end-run will be used this year more 
than ever before and sprinting ability will count in 
making touch-downs. There is quite a diversity of 
opinion on the question of scores. Some authori
ties say that the new rules will make high scores 
and support their opinion by asserting that touch
downs are more easily gained by using a succes
sion of end-runs, forward-passes, and trick-plays 
than by the old style line-buck. Others claim that 
scores will be low due to the difficulty encountered 
through the ruling which prohibits the man carry
ing the ball from getting any assistance from his 
team-mates. Time will show which argument is 
correct. The rule allowing substitution of players 
who have participated in a previous quarter is a 
good one. It allows a man who is knocked out to 
rest without depriving the team of his services later 
in the game should he be in condition to play. The 
early season games will be slow on account of time 
being taken out frequently for the purpose of inter
preting the rules. However, when teams and offi
cials get entirely conversant with the new code, 
there seems to be no reason why foot-ball should 
not continue to be the big, exciting sport that it 
has been in the past.

THE STUDENTS LAMENT.
The hardest thing I know 
Is to go
To work. . .
Id like to shirk
These studies every one. O, gee, its slow 
In this old town.
Just think of sitting down
To study Calculus with midnight lamp aglow.
No!
Id rather see a vaudeville show.
Say, whats the use 
Of all this guff 
Were getting now?
I call it rough!
I cant see one excuse 
For turning any fellow loose 
Among such stuff.
Im mad!
Just think of coming back to school
To get a sched. of thirty cool
And lengthy hours a week. Besides Ive had
This stuff before!
What more
Does any Prof. expect? Its bad,
I say
For any man to work this way.
But wait;
I know what I will do,
Ill tell the Dean a thing or two,
And then
Just let me state,
Things may be changed again,
And work be made more seasonable;
(That is if he 
Will just let me 
Explain a thing or two 
And just be reasonable.)
Oh, ah, um!
Im getting sleepy some.
Hang this math!
Why dont somebody come
And tell a fellow how to work this rum
Old dope?
I hope
The man that wrote this book 
Could see me study.
One look
Would move the heart of anybody.
Whats that?
Its' twelve oclock! >
Shades of the Plymouth Rock!
There Ive worked three hours flat 
On this one page;
It makes me boil and rage 
To have to sit and grind like that!
Im all tired out
And still that stuffs not clear.
To me
Its plain to see
Im overworked. Without a doubt
I have been going some.
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
Oh, ah, um!

STUDENT HEALTH.
Dr. Winfield Scott Hall, Professor of Physiologi
cal Research at Northwestern University of Chicago, 
lectured to the students of the Science and Design 
Schools last Tuesday at 9 A. M. He spoke on the 
subject of Control and Individual Responsibility. 
He has a very masterly address and held his listen
ers enthralled from beginning to end. He treated 
a subject, hitherto handled with kid gloves and a 
great deal of hesitancy, in a manly, outspoken man
ner which could not fail to impress and win the ad
miration of those to whom he spoke.
Dr. Halls lecture is the first of a series of sev
enteen lectures on Hygiene and Sex Physiology, 
which will be given to the Plebe Class by an under 
the direction of Dr. Watson Savage, Supervisor of 
Athletics. At stated intervals, famous lecturers 
will be procured who will lecture to the entire stu
dent body, as did Dr. Hall. The course of lectures 
is a new idea in the field of college hygiene and is 
bound to result in much good.
