Alpha Phi Omega has invalidated 
last weeks Student Senate elections, 
held in front of Doherty Hall Tuesday 
and Wednesday, after Senate violated 
the Student Government Constitution 
six times, according to A Phi O election 
chair Mike Reed.
As a result of the poor planning, only 
4.6 percent of the student body voted 
in last weeks elections, according to

Planning was generally bad all around.
 Mike Reed, 
A Phi 0 elections chair
The decision to scratch the results 
was reached at a special meeting of A 
Phi 0, which serves as the student 
governments board of elections, oh 
Thursday night. The group is recom
mending that Senate try again to hold 
the elections early next semester.
It generally didnt seem as if the 
left hand knew what the right hand
was doing. There was very little com
munication between Senate and us, so 
we didnt know what was going on, 
said Reed, a junior chemical engineer
ing/engineering and public policy ma
jor.
One of the violations, according to 
Reed, was that Senate usurped the role 
of validating petitions, which is usually
done by A Phi 0. This means that A 
Phi O had no way of checking if 
candidates were really eligible, and 
whether the validation of candidates 
was fair and unbiased.
According to Neighbor, A Phi O 
members would have been unable to 
validate petitions in the amount of 
time which Senate had provided, so 
Senate had to do it.
Other violations, according to Reed, 
were that the announcement of the 
election date did not take place be
fore the last day of September, which 
it should have according to the ConPlease see SENATE, page 3

Student Dormitory Councils Sex Week, 
a seven-day series of programs designed to 
raise students awareness about sexual 
issues, came to a close Saturday amidst 
controversy over the organizations Suit

Under what SDC president Eric 
Hamilton calls pressure from the Division 
of Student Affairs, SDCs original door 
prize of a night for two in a Downtown hotel 
was changed to an escorted trip for two to 
New York City.
There was some pressure, said 
Hamilton. We wanted to change the im
pression, but they wanted more.
Some of the events were misinterpreted, 
said Dean of Student Affairs Mike Murphy. 
Others were not legitimate within the 
tone of the week.
The prize was won by Jennifer Boyle, a 
freshman drama major. The trip to New 
York, which will occur sometime in Febru
ary, will be escorted by a member of either 
Student Affairs or Housing, and will include 
separate rooms for Boyle and her guest.
Basically, there was a danger of a 
misperception that we were encouraging 
promiscuity, said SDC president Eric 
Hamilton. Its a bad perception, one thats 
not consistent with the message of re
sponsibility. It was done quite innocently, 
but it became obvious we should make a 
change.
After an article Wednesday in the Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette, the Division of Stu
dent Affairs received complaint calls from

alumni concemingthe Suitcase Dance; 
this forced Murphy and SDC to ne

We wanted to make sure there was 
a constant central message of re

felt that it [the Suitcase Dance] was 
frivolous, that it trivialized respon

The College of Fine Arts build
ing will be renamed Hornbostel 
Hall to honor the buildings archi
tect and first dean, if the Board of 
Trustees approves, as expected, a 
proposal made by President Rob
ert Mehrabian.
Henry Hornbostel was the 
original architect who designed 
the Carnegie Mellon campus, in
cluding what is currently the CFA 
building. He also designed Rodef 
Shalom and the Bureau of Mines 
buildings, and later became the
first dean of CFA.
The College of Fine Arts is not 
a building, it is an institution, 
said CFA Dean Lowry Burgess. 
We would like to get the building 
and the institution disengaged. 
No facility should be seen as the 
central place.
This was the first institution 
where all the arts were housed in 
the same environment, said 
Burgess. The campus design is 
used as a model by other univer
sities.
However, not all members of 
the CFA community are as excited 
about the name change as Bur
gess. Fourth-year architecture 
major Aron Temkin said changing 
the name seems unnecessary. 
The building has a reputation 
already and changing the name 
doesnt serve a purpose.
No matter what the building is 
called, people will still refer to it 
as CFA, said senior music major 
Elisa Billey. But its worth pay
ing a tribute.
Changing the name coincides 
with the completion of the niches 
and the restoration of the build
ing. We are doing the things not 
done to complete this building, 
said Burgess.

Air Force 
shrouds Gulf 
in Stealths
WASHINGTON (AP)  
The Air Force is sending more 
warplanes, including at least 
one additional squadron of F111 Stealth tactical fighterbombers, to the Persian Gulf 
area to expand U.S. offensive 
air power in the area, officials 
said last Friday.
Capt. Betsy Well of the Air 
Force public affairs office at 
the Pentagon said F-l 11 s from 
the 48th Tactical Fighter 
Wing at Royal Air Force Sta
tion, Lakenheath, Britain 
Ipegan deploying to Saudi 
^.rabia on Thursday. Citing 
^pcurity rules, she declined to 
,$ay how many planes and Air 
_F,orce personnel were going, 
n - Air Force officials said plans 
.are under way to dispatch a 
variety of other aircraft to 
Saudi Arabia, but they de
clined to provide details.
The Los Angeles Times, 
citing unidentified defense 
.Sflurces, reported in Fridays 
editions that the Pentagon is 
sending 300 more war
planes to the gulf to in
crease the total Air Force 
deployment in the region 
to about 1,200 planes.
The newspaper report said 
27 Air Force units with about 
10,000 additional personnel 
will be sent to the region.

WASHINGTON (DJ)Despite 
his use of tough war-talk rheto
ric, President Bushs authoriza
tion of high-level talks with Iraqs 
Saddam Hussein indicates hes 
at least temporarily backing off 
his previous hawkish stance in 
the face of domestic pressure.
Pledging to exhaust all means 
of diplomacy before resorting to a 
military strike against Iraq, Bush 
proposed Iraqi foreign minister 
Tariq Aziz visit Washington for 
talks next week. He also suggested 
that Secretary of State Baker
travel to Baghdad to meet with 
Saddam.
Bush peppered his statement 
with tough language pledging that 
the U.S. will act forcefully if it 
comes to military action and em
phasized that whatever happens 
it wont be another Vietnam. He 
also said repeatedly he wants the 
talks so that hes sure that 
Saddam has finally gotten the 
message that hes outnumbered 
and isolated by world opinion. But 
the reasons for the decision might 
have as much to do with domestic
politics as Saddams ability to read 
the newspaper.
The announcement came only 
hours before Bush was to meet 
with leaders of Congress where 
opposition is mounting to a mili
tary strike against Iraq. These 
concerns have been heightened 
by the UN Security Council reso
lution that gave an international 
blessing on the use of force against 
Iraq after January 15.
In the past, the White House 
has consistently rejected the idea 
of any kinds of talks between the
U.S. and Iraq since U.S. objec
tives are clearly laid out in UN 
Security Council resolutions.
At the press conference, Bush 
said he personally decided to start 
the talks because he wanted to 
go the extra mile before com
mitting troops to battle. But, 
clearly, the president now believes 
that there is something to be 
gained from talking, and the ex
tra emphasis on diplomacy might 
serve to stall critics who say he 
hasnt given peaceful options a 
chance to work.

WASHINGTON (DJ) 
The first cracks in the 
dficit-rduction law are 
already beginning to ap
pear on Capitol Hill.
House Democrats this 
week are expected to ap
prove a rule that would 
undo one of the 
administrations proudest 
achievements: a require
ment that the White 
House budget office decide 
if bills meet the pay-asyou-go canon set in the 
deficit-reduction statute.
The proposed House 
rule would require that 
any bill to alter govern
ment benefit programs or 
taxes explicitly state that 
congressional, rather than 
administration, cost esti
mates be used.
Republicans who have 
caught wind of the Demo
crats plans are incensed.
Rep. Willis Gradison of 
Ohio, who represents the 
GOP leadership on the 
House Budget Commit
tee, accused the Demo
crats of welshing on a deal 
just made.
Others suggest that any 
rule change may under
mine the credibility of the 
entire deficit-reduction
package. Its very unfor
tunate for anyone to do 
anything more to create 
the perception that we 
arent fully committed to 
implementing the budget 
agreement, the ink being 
barely dry, said Carol 
Cox, president of the 
Committee for a Respon
sible Federal Budget, a 
business-backed group.
Although little under
stood outside the small 
circle of budget authorities 
in .Washington, the en
forcement provisions are 
a significant part of the 
deficit-reduction law.
Bush concedes 
possible recession
WASHINGTON (D J) 
President Bush gave a 
strong indication that he 
too believes the U.S. now 
headed into a recession.
During the course of a 
statement devoted largely 
to the Gulf crisis last Fri
day, Bush said that at best 
the economy is in a serious 
slowdown and he went on 
to suggest that matters 
could get worse before they 
get better. He made the 
statement at the opening 
of a press conference.
Previously, Bush had 
described the economy as 
in a slowdown without us
ing stronger words such
as serious or at best, 
and his emphasis has 
tended to be on the idea 
that the downturn 
would most likely be 
relatively short and 
shallow.
Bush blamed the 
countrys economic woes 
in large part on higher 
oil prices stemming 
from Iraqs invasion of 
Kuwait.
The president didnt, 
in his prepared re
marks, call for any fresh 
measures to redress the 
economy, such as a fur
ther cut in interest rates 
by the Federal Reserve.

WASHINGTON (DJ)  After years of 
embarrassing losses, the committee 
charged with electing Republicans to the 
House can count some big winners: its top 
staffers and outside political consultants.
Their lucrative contracts have emerged 
as a main issue in a surprisingly nasty 
campaign for the chairmanship of the Na
tional Republican Congressional Commit
tee, headed for 16 years by Rep. Guy Vander 
Jagt of Michigan. In a bid to wrest control, 
Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee has 
raised the potentially explosive question of 
whether personal profits have come at the 
expense of GOP political gains.
To date, frustrated Republicans publicly 
have blamed Democrats gerrymandering 
and self-perpetuating incumbency perks 
for keeping the Republicans a minority in 
the House while they thrived in presiden
tial elections.
But with the Vander Jagt-Sundquist 
contest, to be decided today by a secret 
ballot of the 168 Republicans who will 
serve in the Congress convening in Janu
ary, the fingers of blame have turned in
ward.
In interviews and in letters to Vander 
Jagt and fellow Republicans, Sundquist 
has questioned the campaign committees 
finances in terms that suggest financial 
conflicts of interest between certain staff
ers, particularly the longtime finance di
rector Wyatt Stewart, and vendors with 
whom the multimillion-dollar office does 
business.
Vander Jagt, in turn, dodges the ques
tions, and complains that his rival has 
impugned his integrity with rumors and 
innuendo.
If just 5 percent of that was true, Id be 
in prison instead of head of the NRCC,
he says.
Vander Jagt invites Republicans to 
come to him privately. I dont intend 
to answer on the front page of the 
newspapers, he insists.
Stewart denies the allegations.
Despite the late-breaking controversy, 
even some Sundquist supporters privately 
expect Vander Jagt to win re-election. 
Thats largely because whats more dam
aging in the world of House Republicans, 
so jealous of their independence, is Rep. 
Vander Jagts contention that Sundquist 
is the hand-picked candidate of the 
White House, specifically of Chief of Staff 
John Sununu, who is hugely unpopular 
with Congress. Vander Jagt claims over 
100 commitments, more than enough 
for victory.
In his own letter to Republicans, 
Sundquists campaign manager, Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, said the commit
tee is top-heavy with fat payroll and 
fancy fees for friendly consultants on the 
good-old-boy circuit.
Giving weight to such complaints are 
the personal experiences of some newly 
elected Republicans.
They want you to use the same polling 
firms, the same media people, the same 
consultants. And if you dont do that, they 
dont want to talk to you, says Scott Klug, 
who hired local help and got no money 
from the national committee on his way to 
toppling a 32-year incumbent, Wisconsin 
Democrat Robert Kastenmeier.
Klug says the NRCC suggests a cot
tage industry to keep people employed in 
Washington. And now, based on the 
Sundquist questions, I have some fairly 
serious concerns about where the 
money went.
DoD muffs 
recruiting 
objective
WASHINGTON (AP) - 
The Pentagon released fig. 
ures last week showing that 
the military failed to reach its 
recruitment objectives in Oc
tober for the second month 
since Operation Desert Shield
began.
Some 21,800 people signed 
up for the Army, Air Force, 
Navy, and Marines, 1,600 
fewer than the Defense De
partment had hoped.
The Pentagon said the signup numbers represent 93 per
cent of the militarys objec-' 
tives.
In October 1989, the mili
tary was booming. Recruiting. 
objectives were 11 percent 
over expectations.
But the objectives were, 
lower. The military only, 
sought 19,800 people, but 
20,800 signed up.
The Army had the toughest 
time enlisting people in Octo
ber. The service only met 85., 
percent of its recruiting ob
jective: 9,400 people joined;, 
the Army had hoped for. 
11,100. Ayear ago in October, 
the Army met 111 percent of * 
its objectives.
The Army is the most heavily - 
represented force in Saudi 
Arabia under Desert Shield.
In October, the Navy, Ma
rine Corps, and Air Force met 
100 percent of their objectives.
The September figures 
show that recruitment figures - 
were high. The military 
signed up 27,600 people, 111 
percent of the number sought. 
At the same time a year ago,! 
some 31,100 people joined the"1 
military, 100 percent of the 
objective.
But in August, the month 
President Bush launchedDesert Shield, only 97 percent1 
of the recruiting objective was  
matched when some 25,400' 
people joined the services.

Senate election muddle angers candidates
By RHONDA STRUMIN GER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Many candidates who ran for 
Student Senate positions this past 
^eek find themselves frustrated 
at the outcome of the election, but 
jnost say they will probably run 
^gain when the second round of 
lections occurs.
Three of the candidates, MCS 
junior Jay Laefer, CIT junior 
ftathan Loofbourrow, and CIT 
gophomore Hugh Moore, wrote 
(jfficial complaints to the election 
joard, A Phi O, while others have 
p,een left in the dark.
I am pleased with the outcome 
hat A Phi 0 has voided the elec
tion  mostly because Student 
Senate, by failing to meet certain
requirements, caused a low voter 
turnout, said Laefer. Because 
of this, I won my seat but I might 
not have taken it while others 
may have taken theirs.
Moore planned to complain be
fore the results were calculated. 
Candidates were never informed 
if their petitions were accepted or 
not and had no time to campaign; 
the student body didnt know the 
candidates, said Moore. Nobody 
knew the election was happen
ing.... A Phi O members did not 
know they were running the elec
tion until one day before, and 
much of the student body is not 
even aware that an election took 
place.
Laefers complaint arose from 
his annoyance with Student
"Candidates were never informed if 
their petitions were accepted or not 
and had no time to campaign.
 Hugh Moore, 
newly elected CIT Senator
Senate. I was pleased with A Phi
0. Given that they had short no
tice, they did what they could, but 
with a low voter turn out, there 
wasnt much they could do, he 
said.
The only thing that really 
bothers me is that we werent 
notified of the election results 
within the three days allowed for
in the election rules I received, 
said CIT junior Elizabeth Zika. I 
dont really know what went 
wrong but unless you really knew 
what was going on, you would 
have had no idea about Student 
Senate elections.... The whole 
process needs improvement. It is 
very frustrating because it is time 
consuming to repeat the whole
process.
Loofbourrow said that he did 
not know election procedures but 
the process seemed strange. The 
elections were soon after the pe
titions were turned in and there 
was no mention of the candidates 
in The Tartan. The elections were 
skewed because the polls were 
not open when they were sup
posed to be and those voting hadnt 
known the candidates.
I wanted to determine if some
thing had gone wrong or if this 
was standard procedure before I 
complained, said Moore. I read 
a copy of the by-laws on Andrew 
and then decided to write a letter 
to the chair of the election board. 
Some of what I found was that 
petitions for candidacy have to be
turned in 14 days before elections, 
we could turn ours in up to eight 
days before the election. Fur
thermore, petitions are supposed 
to be out for 28 days and they 
were only out for 15.
Since there was a screw-up in 
the elections, it would have been 
nice if they [Student Senate or A 
Phi 0] had called those people 
running to tell us what was going 
on...if we are going to have reelections or what, said H&SS 
sophomore Dolly Shen. I guess I 
was disappointed  no one 
seemed to care.
All candidates mentioned that 
they would run again. At this 
time I believe I will run again, but 
not if elections are before next 
semester, said Zika.
Ivk/dv /Std/okt NUcG ilSao.oOok, vav.dockt
.iutoiw asDV ,I'X W
stitution, and the decision to ask A Phi O 
to be the election board was not made 
within the time frame that the Consti
tution specifies. A list of election board 
ijiembers was never submitted for apjroval to the full Senate.
Also, petitions were accepted up to 
eight days before the elections and were 
available for pickup only 15 days before 
elections. According to the Constitution, 
petitions must be submitted no later 
;han 14 days before the date of the elecijon.
; The voting tables were located outside 
Doherty Hall from 2:30 to 4:30 pm on 
Tuesday and from 10:30 to 4:30 on 
Wednesday. Tuesdays late start was due 
to the fact that Reed didnt receive the 
1st of validated candidates from Senate
until 3:30 on Monday, and needed time 
to compile the information and get it to 
the printer.
One of the largest causes of controversy 
was the late announcement of the elec
tion date and the subsequent delay in 
the receival and validation of petitions, 
so that the candidates didnt have suffi
cient time to mount a campaign. The 
eight days allotted included Thanksgiv
ing break, when many students were at 
their homes and campaigning was largely 
ineffective.
Normally Senate tells us when the 
dates of the election will be. It was kind 
of shocking to find the dates out from The 
Tartan. Planning was generally bad all 
around, said Reed.
There was a lack of communication 
between Senate and A Phi O, between
the Senate chair and the PR chair.... 
[There was also] the University schedule, 
which has always been a problem, said 
Neighbor.
I told A Phi O about the elections 
coming up, but I forgot to get back in 
touch with them after finding out the 
exact date. I apologize for that, said 
Mark Schaeffer, Senates PR chair.
This isnt the first time that Senate 
has been late in fulfilling its election 
procedure requirements. Last semester, 
Senate failed to appoint an A Phi 0 
election board in time, so individual 
members of the campus community were 
called on to validate petitions.
It was not contested last year, but it 
probably should have been, said Neigh
bor.
One A Phi 0 member, Paul Massey,
objected to declaring the elections in
valid, saying there wasnt adequate proof 
that the election schedule hindered can
didates, particularly the challengers. 
The majority of campaigning is done in 
the last few days anyway, said Massey.
The percentages were off, but it was 
par for the amount of time the tables 
were open, said Neighbor.
Its unfortunate but understandable, 
said Neighbor. Weve had a lot of prob
lems scheduling elections in the past. I 
wanted them before Thanksgiving but 
before we could get things rolling it was 
too late.
Neighbor says that next year he will 
make a strong recommendation that 
elections be held before Thanksgiving 
because new Senators should be trained 
and started before finals, during which
Senate doesnt hold meetings.
According to Reed, A Phi O has sug
gested that new petitions will be due the 
last day of finals and then elections will 
be rescheduled for the second week of 
classes next semester. Neighbor said 
Senate will meet to discuss this and 
hopefully they will agree to this sugges
tion. Neighbor added that maybe this 
will even work out better and they might 
consider scheduling elections this way in 
the future. The newly elected Senators 
will hold their positions until elections 
are reheld, most likely in the first few 
weeks of next semester.
Though it has caused most of us in
convenience, it shows that the candi
dates care and that they really want to 
be on Senate, so I dont have a problem 
with redoing the election, said Neighbor.

acre plot where the Jones and 
Laughlin Steel Mill operated un
til 1979. Once completed, the hightech center will house all of the 
research projects that are cur
rently going on in Mellon Insti
tute and three other CMU re
search facilities. Pitts half of the 
center will house bioengineering 
and biotechnology research.
Carnegie Mellons progress has 
been faltering due to high costs, 
lack of investors, cyanide in the 
sites soil, and the questioning of 
the grants conditions which re
quired CMU to locate private in
vestors to match the $17 million 
dollar grant from the URA. The 
URA reconsidered the conditions 
of the grant due to lack of interest 
expressed by private groups.
In 1988, Oxford Development 
Co. offered to put up the $17 mil
lion required under the grant. 
Problems arose after Oxford De
velopment Co. were unable to find 
even one investor. According to a 
1989 Pittsburgh Press article, the
lack of interest stemmed from the 
interior dimensions which were 
too unconventional for traditional, 
speculative office space.
World cl7ass architect Peter 
Eisenman designed the CMU 
portion of the center. Former uni
versity President Richard Cyert 
asked Eisenman to design a 
building that would somehow 
represent technology. True to his 
assignment, Eisenman designed 
a building which exemplified the 
artificial intelligence term bool
ean cube. The building would 
have been comprised of 18 inter
locking boolean cubes with the 
Mellon Institute occupying three 
or four of the cubes.
The building designed by 
Eisenman had an estimated cost 
of $22 million. In order to accom
modate the $17 million budget 
the building would have had to be 
shrunk so much that it would 
have been useless, Schillo said 
in the November/December 1990 
issue of FOCUS. CMU dismissed 
Eisenman in December 1989, a 
month after Oxford Development 
Co. dropped the architect.

Cable News Network recently 
aired a report from Carnegie 
Mellons Mechanical Engineer
ing and Materials Science de
partment about a recent break
through in the area of steel re
cycling developed on campus.
The breakthrough deals with 
separation of copper from the 
steel.
Steel is hard to recycle, be
cause a lot of it contains copper. 
Once you melt it down, the 
copper melts in and you cant 
get it out. In order to make new 
steel, you have to get rid of the 
copper, said MEMS professor 
R.J. Fruehan.
According to MEMS depart
ment head Anthony Thompson, 
a consortium of several large 
steel companies gave the Uni
versity a grant for basic re
search on steel recycling.
This process was the result 
of that research, he said.
Fruehan said, Basically, 
weve developed a procedure to 
take cheap scrap steel  which 
contains a lot of copper  and 
melt it down. We then combine 
it with iron sul fide, which reacts 
with the copper. Then you can 
separate the two and use the 
steel.
By using the process, steel 
recycled from scrap can be made 
using only 25 percent of the 
energy used to make new steel, 
according to Fruehan.
There is a large difference 
between the price of cheap scrap 
and expensive, rare copper-free 
scrap right now. As that differ
ence gets bigger, this method 
becomes cheaper in comparison 
to buying more expensive 
scrap, said Fruehan. In five or 
ten years, that may make this 
method economically neces
sary.

After receiving complaints from residents, Carnegie Mellons 
Housing Office is asking resident assistants to help evaluate the 
conditions of University laundry facilities. Packs of laundry 
tokens were distributed to each RA, and each RA was also 
assigned specific washers and dryers to use in order to determine 
which, if any, machines are not working properly.

Correction...
In Jeffrey Woodfords column (Power from nuclear fission: Is 
it really your friend, or not?, 11/5),an incorrect statement 
implied that nuclear fission plants give off carbon dioxide. 
Nuclear fission plants produce heat, not carbon dioxide.

designated and restricted 
projects. These include large 
projects, such as work on 
University Center and 
the Performing Arts center.
Money for these projects 
comes from gifts and grants. 
[The other $97.5 million of 
the capital budget is for 
sponsored research activi
ties in the colleges. These 
jnclude over $25 million for 
jjie Carnegie Institute of 
Technology and Mellon Col
lege of Science, over $25 
pillion for the school of 
Computer Science and the 
Software Engineering Insti
tute, and the remaining 
tnoney split between CFA, 
H&SS, GSIA, SUPA, CMRI, 
nd PSC.
This is a very tight bud
get, said Keating. However, 
by year end, we will be sure 
that both budgets are bal
anced.
Keating said that there 
might be a small surplus, but 
said, there will not be a 
deficit.
There is a $2 million sur
plus built into this years 
budget for contingencies, so 
that the budget wont be ex
ceeded, said Keating.
As of yet, the University 
has not started budgeting to 
pay of the $50 million debt 
that it has incurred, but 
Keating said that would hap
pen next year. The debt 
doesnt even come due for five 
more years, when the bonds 
mature, said Keating.

Freshman electrical engineer Lisa Hossaini, junior civil engineer Meri 
Tyler, and junior psychology major Julie Sterbank participate in the Sex 
in the Lobby portion of Sex Week, a student question-and-ahswer session 
which occurred in the Morewood reading room.
SUITCASE, from page 1
cisionto change the Suitcase Dance 
prize], said Area Coordinator for 
HousingTeresa Campbell, who was 
involved in the planning and prepa
ration for Sex Week. I dont really 
know the background and I wasnt 
there for the discussions between 
SDC and Student Affairs, so Id re
ally just be speculating.
Student Affairs also received 
complaint calls about other Sex 
Week events, but Murphy mostly 
discounts those complaints.
It was mostly people who heard 
about one piece taken out of con
text, he said. Some [events] prob
ably were in poor taste, but it was 
largely people just seeing bits and 
pieces. The vast majority of the 
events empahsized responsibility.
Sex Week received a lot of atten
tion in the local media; however, the 
Post-Gazette article altered the in
tended tone of the week, according 
to Campbell.
I think that the article in the 
Post-Gazette created a twist, she
said. It made Sex Week a lot more 
eye-catching than it really was and 
that created a lot of the stress. 
Despite the Suitcase Dance prob
lem, all parties agree that Sex Week 
was a success.
It was a nice series of events, said 
Murphy, especially the things done 
in conjunction with W orld AIDS Day.  
It was phenomenal, said 
Campbell. Events were well-at
tended, and it was exciting to see 
SDC plan everything right down to 
the names of the programs. I think 
they have a lot to be proud of.
I dont even think everyones con
cerned about Sex Week itself, just 
this one incident. It would be a shame 
to see Sex Week overshadowed by the 
problem with the Suitcase Dance. 
We had a good reaction, said 
Hamilton. Our intention was to do 
something to catch peoples attention, 
and I think we succeeded. People 
have been encouraged to think about 
the issues related to sex whether 
they attended or not, and thats whats 
important.

With Apples introduction of three new 
Macintosh computers, meeting the challenges of college 
life just got a whole lot easier. Because now, everybody 
can afford a Macintosh.
The MB'BiiilBBWilfflittMi is our most 
affordable model, yet it comes with everything you needincluding a hard disk drive. The BBSE3SE3 
combines color capabilities with affordability. And the 
HRSfflfflafflEB is perfect for students who need a 
computer with extra power and expandability.
No matter which Macintosh you choose, youll 
have a computer that lightens your work load without
giving you another tough subject to learn. Every Macintosh 
computer is easy to set up and even easier to master. And 
when youve learned one program, youre well on your 
way to learning them all. Thats because thousands of avail
able programs all work in the same, consistent manner. 
You can even share information with someone who uses a 
different type of computer-thanks to Apples versatile 
SuperDrive^ which reads from and writes to Macintosh, 
MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks.
See the new Macintosh computers for yourself, 
and find out how surviving college just got a whole lot 
easier.

Student Senates semesterly 
budget hearing went off with few 
hitches last Tuesday, when the 
budgets of 28 student organiza
tions were approved by the full 
Senate. Most organizations are 
not displeased with the results. 
We received the allotted 
jnount that we had asked for 
as a result, we are very 
pleased, said Ulysses Wu, presi
dent of the Carnegie Student Inilvement Association.
According to Student Senate 
fchair Chris Neighbor, Senate 
^accepted the figures which the 
Funding and Recognition Com
mittee had given them. F&R had 
cuts to come under budget 
and no further cuts were neces
"The proceedings went very smoothly 
 we had no trouble at all. 
 Mike Walker; 
president, Scotch n Soda
sary  there werent any com
plaints.
Although it is required by the 
Student Government Constitu
tion, no ad was placed in The 
Tartan, a step which is required 
by the Fiscal Policy for such bud
get proceedings, but most of the 
organizations were notified.... If 
there wasnt a representative 
there, we called them, said 
Neighbor.
Sweepstakes Chair Ray Fratto 
said that, we are happy with the
amount of money we received. 
The budget is streamlined now 
but we do have room to maneuvre 
if something bad happens.
Our hearing was very easy 
because Scotch n Soda has a good 
reputation for being reasonable 
with our budgets, said Jennifer 
Adams, managing director of 
Scotch n Soda. However, the 
new budget cut quite a bit from 
our funds; our budget was reduced 
by 14 percent.
. Mike Walker, president of
Scotch n Soda, agreed. We bud
geted for it. As always, we would 
have liked to have had more, but 
it didnt affect us that much. The 
proceedings went very smoothly
 we had no trouble at all.
I dont think we got cut, said 
Ben Schoenberg, of the Juggling 
Club. We were pretty fortunate. 
Last year we requested more 
money for equipment; this year, 
we didnt need so much.
Schoenberg, who is also a 
member of the Chess Club, said 
that the club applied for a special 
allocation for a tournament, but 
he was unsure as to whether or 
not they would be awarded the 
money, since Senate is short of 
funds.

Crime and Incident Report
11/16 HARASSMENT,
am. A fem ale C amegi e 
Mellon student said that 
while she and her room
mate were walking in a 
driveway in the fraternity 
quadrangle, they were verbally harassed 
by someone at a second-floor window of 
Pi Kappa Alpha. Campus Police spoke to 
the residents of the room in question, 
and one of the residents said that he 
would accept an internal citation for the 
actions which occurred from his room.
11/16 BURGLARY, 5:56 am. A Pi 
Kappa Alpha brother told Campus Police 
that persons unknown had entered the 
Pika house and had removed a Fender 
amp, valued at $350,- from the basement 
near the bar. The brother also said that 
before the theft was discovered, he saw a 
white male, about six feet tall, with brown 
liair and wearing a black and grey 
sweater who was hanging around Pika. 
The first time the man was noticed, he
had a blue carry-on bag, which he didnt 
have the second time he was seen. The 
bag was later found in Pikas barbecue 
pit. When questioned, the man could not 
give a good reason for being in the house, 
so he was escorted out of it. The theft was 
noticed shortly after.
11/16 DISORDERLY CONDUCT, 
11:28 pm. Campus Police received a re
port of a fight by the Morewood Gardens 
entrance desk. Responding officers en
countered a group of Delta Tau Delta 
brothers gathered around another stu
dent. Campus Police learned that that 
student and another student were chased 
from the DTD basement because one of 
them was observed urinating on the 
basement mens room walls and floor. 
The first student had been chased to 
Morewood Gardens and was caught at 
the A-tower desk, but the other student 
had escaped. After escorting the DTD 
brothers back to their house, Campus 
Police located the second student, who
appeared veryintoxicated. DTD broth
ers who were brought to the house posi
tively identified the student as the man 
who urinated on the walls and floor. The , 
incident was turned over to Student Af
fairs.
11/18 THREATENING CALLER,
5:32 am. A WRCT disc jockey called 
Campus Police to report that he had 
received a threatening phone call from a 
male caller. The caller said, I know that 
you are one of those faggots from CFA. I 
planted a bomb where you are at [WRCT] 
and you have five minutes to live. The 
caller then hung up.
A search was conducted of the entire 
area from the basement to the roof, but 
no bomb was found.
11/19 THEFT, 1:51 pm. A Carnegie 
Mellon staff member told Campus Police 
that a $20 bill was removed from his 
wallet, and that he noticed a suspicious 
person earlier whom he feels may be 
responsible. Earlier that day, a man say
ing that he was from the Physical Plant 
entered his office and said that he needed 
to check a circuit breaker because of a 
power outage. He then asked the staff 
member if he could use the phone; he 
di aled a number, then hung up the phone, 
saying that his office would call him 
back, even though he never spoke with 
anyone about the offices extension num
ber. While using the phone, the man was 
standing where he had a clear view of the 
staff members wallet, which was inside 
his backpack. Both the staff member and 
the other man left, and when the staff 
member returned, $20 was missing from 
his wallet. The staff member called 
Physical Plant, who said that none of its 
personnel had been in that area on any 
calls.
11/24 ASSAULT, 11:29 pm. A Carn
egie Mellon student notified Campus 
Police that he had been assaulted in 
Oakland. Fie did not know the exact 
place of the assault or how many people
source: Student Senate
assaulted him. Fie said that after the 
incident occurred, he stopped two offic
ers in Oakland to report it, but they 
refused to take a report of the incident. 
The student was transported to PresbyterianUniversity Hospital, and was held 
for observation for memory loss.
11/25 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 9:41 
am. Campus Police were notified that 
the change machine located on the first 
floor. of Hunt Library was lying on its 
side and money was on the floor. It was 
discovered that the electrical cord was 
damaged at the plug end, which caused

$7.60 was recovered when the machine

Senate PR caused election mess
Two-way communication. Its 
the essential part of any relationship, whether between 
friends, intimate partners, or 
family members.
Its also the essential part of the 
relationship between an organi
zation like Student Senate and its publics: its members, its elections 
board, the members of the clubs it 
funds, andmost importantly  
its constituents.
Good two-way communication between an organization and its 
publics is so important that most 
large organizations, Senate in
cluded, have a public relations arm to foster it.
Well, if the election mess Senate 
managed to create last week is any indication, Senates PR com
mittee should be renamed. Wed suggest Public Confusion Com
mittee, although many Senate 
insiders would offerSenateBlowOffCommittee as an alternative.
You see, its an open secret 
around Senate that getting your
self appointed to the PR commit
tee as a Senator is the equivalent 
to a free ride. You do no work, but 
you get to put Student Senate on 
your resume.The fact is, the PR Committee  
led, if thats the word, by CIT 
senior Mark Schaeffer  hasnt 
done anything to construct even 
one-way communication between Senate and its publics.
The result was clear: a muddled 
election, with candidates who had 
no clue what they were supposed 
to do, an elections board that had 
no idea what Senate had planned, and a voters who were never told 
elections were being held.
Consider the following public 
relations blunders:
Alpha Phi Omega, the tradi
tional elections board for Senate elections, was never officially 
voted into that role this semester, 
as required by the Student Gov
ernment Constitution. Thats like 
expecting someone to do you a favor without ever asking him or 
her to do it.
The service fraternity was 
never officially informed of the 
date of the election by Senate PR 
Chair Schaeffer; in fact, A Phi O Elections Chair Mike Reed found 
the date from reading the fine print of an ad in The Tartan.
 Petitions were not available for candidates to pick up on time, and 
the deadline for turning them in 
was only eight days before the 
election. Not only were petitions 
given out and collected late, but 
many students were never aware 
that petitions were available.As a result of late petitions, Senate again violated the Consti
tution by having current Sena
tors validate the petitions. Besides 
being a blatant conflict of interest,
they did the job too late; A Phi Os 
Reed was not given a list of valid 
candidates until the night before 
the elections, and thus did not 
have time to get ballots copied.
Most students, ourselves in
cluded, did not know there was an 
election coming up. They felt uninformed because there were no 
posters on campus, no advertise
ments or stories announcing the 
election in either the Student 
Union or The Tartan.
The PR blunders didnt stop 
with the election. After the vote 
was held, many of the candidates 
were informed by a Tartan re
porter this weekend about the outcome, although the Constitu
tion requires they be notified by 
Senat within three days.According to Senate Chair Chris 
Neighbor, the mistakes sur
rounding the election were un
fortunate but understandable.
We disagree  our under
standings been stretched a little 
too thin.
How could such confusion pos
sibly exist? Theres only one an
swer: poor communication from 
Senate to A Phi 0, to the candi
dates, to the campus press, and to 
the student body.
In short, a PR screw-up.The fault for that lies primarily 
with Schaeffer,"who hasnt seemed 
to break much of a sweat in car
rying out his duties as head of 
Senates communications arm, 
and Neighbor, who has no excuse 
for letting Schaeffer make such a 
big mess since he obviously knows 
how to do the job himself  he 
once held it.
But the rest of Senate doesnt escape without blame. Public re
lations isnt something that can 
be pushed off on a committee, es
pecially in a representative body 
like Senate. Itsevery Senators job, 
but every Senator seems to have 
taken it for granted that some 
other Senator was handling it.
Plans are underway for a new 
election date, which will probably 
be held early next semester, so 
the harm done by the elections 
mess seems to be temporary. But 
we hope the snafu was a learning 
experience for Senate, which 
desperately needs to understand the necessity of communication.
" We have two pieces of advice for 
Senators. First, Senate tradition 
to the contrary, PR isnt a passive 
task  so get off your butts and 
communicate with your constitu
ents. (Figure out what you want 
to say first  itll help a lot.) 
Second, sign up for the IM 
Departments PR course, 70-520, 
taught by Vice President for 
University Relations Don Hale. If 
public disasters like the recent election cant teach the lesson, 
maybe the professionals can.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
During the past year 
in my term of Presi
dent of the Interfratemity Council, I never 
saw it my place to use 
my position as a soap box from which I 
could address issues that I personally 
felt strongly about. But, now with six 
months left at this school and less than a 
week left in office, I would like for some 
of my feelings to be heard. I worked my 
butt off because I believed in a system 
that stands for leadership, character, 
and brotherhood but does not always 
relay this image to itself or to those not a 
part of it. Therefore, feeling so strongly 
about the system, I would like to bring to 
light some of my views in hopes that both 
Greeks and non-Greeks can reach a level 
of understanding so that we can exist 
peacefully together.
Let me begin by speaking to those in 
fraternities and sororities. As brothers 
and sisters, you have sworn to uphold 
the beliefs and values of your Greek 
organization. Those who have done so 
before you have left some challenging 
footsteps to follow, and thus your respon
sibility as a brother dr sister should not
be taken lightly. Did you know that 23 
U.S. Presidents were in fraternities? Or 
that 76 percent of the House of Repre
sentatives is Greek? 76 percent! And 85 
percent of the Fortune 500 executives 
also come from Greek-letter organiza
tions. You should know what kind of 
weight is on your shoulders by the fact 
that you bear letters on your chest.
What you also need to realize is that 
there are many problems facing the Greek 
system that are threatening to discon
tinue this production of leaders that has 
gone on for centuries. They include al
cohol abuse, hazing, acquaintance rape, 
and attitudes towards women, homo
sexuals, and minorities. If you do not see 
these problems on our campus today, 
you are quite naive.
However, if you do see the problems 
affecting our system, but do not feel it 
your personal duty as a Greek to do 
i something about them, then you are not 
living up to the expectations of your 
brothers and sisters, your national, and 
yourself. Thus, you are a walking lie.
If you are a chauvinist or a bigot, you 
do not belong in the Greek system. There 
are too many of us working too hard to 
promote the positive aspects of being
Greek and your negative attitudes are 
just bringing the system down.
I would also like to address the mem
bers of the community who are notmembers of a fraternity or a sorority. I ask 
that you understand that we as Greeks 
do not stand for alcohol and drug abuse, 
or date rape, or discrimination, or hazing.
If you come across a Greek member 
who is promoting or condoning these 
detriments to our system, challenge their 
actions and ask if he or she is living up to 
the standards of his. or her Greek orga 
nization. After all, they took an oath.
But to bash the Greek system as a 
whole succeeds in nothing except to widen 
a gap of hatred and misunderstanding 
that I should hope that no person wants 
to even exist.
So, to Greeks and non-Greeks alike, I 
ask that you listen to each others opin
ions openly, for that is the only way that 
harmony will be achieved. And, to each 
Greek, I charge you with the responsi-' 
bility of the knowledge that until no 
problems remain associated with the 
Greek system, your work is not done.

Well, the Student 
Senate elections are 
over. As usual, right LttT tO 
after the elections, FHrfrn1
people are going to be Iiie CQItor 
amazed by the low turnout. So is there 
really a campus-wide apathy problem, or 
is there some more deeply rooted prob
lem with the election process?
In fact, this was one of the worst-run 
elections I have ever heard of. It is pos
sible that Senate could have done a worse 
job, but it would have required an effort.
Students were informed that they could 
get election petitions on November 12. 
This would have allowed them one week 
to collect the needed 25 signatures. This 
is not at all unreasonable.
However, the Skibo information desk 
either did not receive the petitions, or
ran out almost instantly. By the time 
most people had read the advertisement, 
it was impossible to get a petition. Infor
mation was also not told when they would 
receive another batch of petitions.
Candidates were then not informed if 
their petitions had been accepted so they 
did not know if they needed to campaign. 
They were not even informed of the date 
of the election except by another ad in 
The Tartan. There were no phone calls, 
and not even postering. Even the A Phi O 
election committee was not informed of 
when the election would be until hours 
before it was to begin.
The election was held directly after the 
Thanksgiving break. Neither The Tartan 
nor the Student Union was able to print 
up a list of candidates, so the votfers had 
no idea of who was running. Because not 
even the candidates knew who was running, or when the elections were held, it 
was virtually impossible to campaign.
Apparently there were also several 
violations of Student Senate bylaws in 
the running of the elections. Among other 
factors, according to the Senate constitu
tion, all candidates who entered peti
tions later than November 12 (the first 
day that petitions were advertised to the 
student body) were automatically ineli
gible. The constitution also states that 
the date of the election must be an
nounced by the last day of September.
All in all, Senate managed to completely 
botch the election. I think that if there is 
any talk about student apathy, it should 
be clear where the finger needs to be 
pointed.

CMU shuttle service wheels out a bad deal

Dont give gifts you dont plan to
Many of us come from suburban 
or rural areas. Doors arent locked 
in our neighborhoods, we leave 
our cars open overnight, we forget 
things on the lawn, and we worry 
about rain more than thieves.
But were no longer in the burbs. CMU is located next door to 
Oakland, a very urban area, and 
our safety, while protected by a 
competent Campus Police force, 
is still lower than at home.Why the rehash of a story weve 
all heard before? A rash of rob
beries always tends to occur 
around the Christmas season, and
we should take precautions now 
more than ever.
Dont walk home alone.
Make sure your locks work on 
both your doors and windows, and use them, even when youre home
 last year, several people in Morewood were surprised when 
they woke up to find strangers going through their things.
Lock up your valuables when 
you leave for the holidays, or even 
better, take them with you. And 
dont leave your knapsack or 
bookbag unattended on campus.
It sounds simple, and it is. '
Editor:
Friday, November 
16, 9:17 am, outside 
Carol Apts, on Centre 
Avenue. I wonder 
where the shuttle is, 
because it should have arrived 2 minutes 
ago. Good thing its the A route only, so I 
can still make it to campus in time for my 
9:30 exam, even if it is a little late.
9:20 am. The shuttle comes into sight, 
and stops at Hampshire Hall. I am re
lieved, I will still make it until I realize 
the orange sign in the window reads AB. 
It is running the long route: at best, the 
shuttle will arrive back on campus at 
9:30, which means I will be late for my 
exam. Without a second thought, I sprint 
dpwn Devonshire St.  destination:. 
Scaife Hall.
Needless to say, I set my personal best 
in running the mile that day  and 
fortunately, I did make it to the exam on 
time, but that isnt the point. The steady 
decline in the shuttles service had gone 
so far as to almost cost me a portion of my 
course grade  and that was too far.
It is certainly a privilege that CMU 
offers a Shuttle/Escort service. For those 
of us who live in off-campus University
housing, the shuttle is a great way to get 
to campus quickly, avoid walking in bad 
weather or darkness, or just ride when 
youre too tired to walk. It is a conve
nience that is popular and appreciated 
by its users.
Unfortunately, some responsibilities 
come with operating this system. CMU 
has set a schedule for the shuttle route, 
and people have come to depend on it. 
Many people get that extra 20 minutes of 
sleep, take the shuttle, and still make 
their first class on time  or used to.
Over the past year, the Shuttle/Escort 
program has slowly declined. This year, 
the service has been especially poor. 
Though I dont have the exact figure, it is 
a fair estimate to say that there has been 
only one shuttle running for half of this 
semester. How can one call this consistent 
service? In 1990, things are expected to 
work more than half the time. If not, 
then they are discarded, as the shuttles 
themselves should be.
Both shuttles are over six years old. 
The elder has over 115,000 miles on it, 
while the new model has a mere 85,000+. 
The seats are ripped, virtually none of 
the dashboard gauges work, and the 
drivers have periodically mentioned that
there have been severe brake, steering, 
and electrical problems, and that they 
have had to drive the shuttles anyway, 
even in these unsafe conditions. I guess 
we will have to wait until the shuttle 
falls apart at the seams after hitting a 
Pittsburgh chuckhole, or has a severe 
accident before we finally get a new one.
I have asked the drivers why there has 
been such resistance to getting a new 
shuttle. The answer? Money, or the lack 
thereof. Yet, I notice that the CMU Trafc 
fic Patrol has brand new minivans. Hnwl 
What does it take to get new shuttles. 
Perhaps we should raise tuition so we 
can afford them? What do you say, a 
other $1,000 or $2,000 per year? If!? 
University cant find enough money fr$. 
the millions they collect in tuition to buj 
two new shuttle buses, then perhaps 
some people working the finances a 
W arner Hall should re-take some of then 
management classes. God forbid we 
would get some value for our $20,000.
The same argument goes for the esco  
vans. On the whole, they have beenir? 
countless accidents, the newest one 15 
four years old, and all get a rough vvorkou 
simply because they get used every da.'

Editor:
Its my 
turn, isnt it?
Ive learned a 
lot from all 
this. Ive been 
threatened by electronic mail, 
but that was settled in a gentlenian-like fashion, as this letter 
will hopefully do. Ive re^d all of 
the rebuttals to my letter. First 
of all, Ill apologize to anyone 
who was offended by the stereo
types of whites' or the shots 
"taken at MCS or some other 
things I did. I fault myself for 
writing the letter out of anger, 
instead out of reason. Thus, as a 
writer, I was sloppy. However, 
Im not. going to apologize for 
the reasons I wrote the letter, 
but for only how I wrote it.
Im not going to stand here 
and declare Im not a racist. As 
with Michael Callihans Im not 
a homophobic, I will not insult 
your intelligence by trying to 
make you believe such garbage. 
Not once in my first letter did I 
admit I was not prejudiced. 
From my experience, any rea
sonable person will admit a 
prejudice within them. It may 
range from the smallest to the 
largest degree.
With his first letter, Callihan 
insulted us all by his statement 
of Im not a homophobic. With 
his second letter, I am not con
vinced. He admits to not read
ing The Tartan that often, but 
when you see, as your friends 
called The cmuOUT Newslet
ter, then you go to the trouble to 
write a letter saying that they 
shouldnt receive so much space 
in The Tartan because youre 
tired of it. When something is 
written, there is an audience 
who will, read it. If you dont 
want to read it, then fine. Some
body did, however. Your prefer
ences shouldnt be put ahead of 
all others. You cant decide 
whats right for us to read. You 
say youre not a homophobic, 
but think of all the time you put 
into speaking against them, in
stead of leaving them alone.
I didnt appreciate the socalled noble stance you took in 
the second letter, painting me 
as the villain. Your paranoia in 
the first letter was so obvious to 
me, I was surprised that you 
denied it and others didnt see 
it. I dont see how you can deny 
the obvious. You still scare the 
h6ll out of me.
Sean OMullans letter exactly 
hit what disappointed myself in 
my first letter. The form was 
totally crap and conveyed no real 
meaning. I should have ex
panded what I thought a 
homophobic was, which is some
thing I described above, such as 
speaking out against gays and 
not admitting their personal 
prejudices. Usually, homo
phobics utilize the words faggot 
and homo to insure their own 
masculinity. However, Sean 
wanted to limit my freedom of 
speech. Lets say your letter was

If Patryk Sil

that I have 
fired and 
missed again, 
then he has picked up my stray 
round and shot himself in the

norities are not (his italics) pro
duced in the crucible of conscious
ness. However, that defies all 
reasonable logic.
The sole basis for all forms of 
discrimination is that behavior, 
appearance, or any other trait 
you care to name is found to be 
unacceptable to whatever group 
is doing the discriminating. White 
supremacists discriminate 
against Blacks because their skin 
color is different and therefore 
unacceptable. Homophobics dis
criminate against homosexuals 
because their sexual preference 
is different and therefore unac
ceptable. Discrimination can take 
the form of structural determi
nations but the basis for -such is 
the recognition of unacceptable 
differences weeding their way into 
the ruling majority. We concenSHUTTLE, from page 8
But somehow, a trip to Physical 
Plant seems enough to someone 
to fix the problem. It is a viscious 
cycle: the riders suffer from the 
system being shorthanded, the 
fix is temporary, and the service 
declines more. Its time to stop 
putting a band-aid on a lacera
tion, and time for the tourniquet.
Its really too bad that only the 
shuttle and escort drivers hear
trate too much on the differences 
between each other when what 
we should really concentrate on is 
what makes each of us alike: the 
fact that we are all human beings.
Mr. Silver, when you identify 
me with the white, male, middleclass, young, and educated group 
you seem so quick to put down, 
isnt that discrimination in its own 
right? Arent you separating me 
from the rest of humanity by 
pointing out what makes me dif
ferent from other people?
Yes Mr. Silver, I am white, I am 
male, I am middle-class, I am 
young, and I consider myself 
educated (and Im pleased to see 
that you consider me the same 
since some of your earlier writings 
seemed to suggest otherwise). 
From people Ive talked to that 
have met you, I know that you are 
white also. You are also male. 
Since the majority of the Ameri
can population is middle-class, 
Im going to assume you are too; 
and since you are a graduate 
student at this university, I can 
say that youve received an edu
cation. Isnt it very/oolish to de

drivers are very friendly, courte
ous, and responsible people and 
say nothing when we speak of the 
poor quality that the service is 
providing. They freely give us the 
facts, and provide good conversa
tion en route to our destination. 
Its amazing that they can put up 
with this bus-shuffling. I only ride 
the shuttle two or three times a 
day  they ride it 16 times.

Mr. Silver, I hate being more 
fortunate than others, I really do. 
Does this surprise you? Im not 
proud to admit that I come from 
an upper-middle-class community 
where children grow up with food 
on their plates and have a decent 
school to go to when not every
body has the same good fortune. 
Graduates from my high school 
were expected to become busi
nessmen, doctors, lawyers, and 
enter other high prestige and high 
salary fields. That made me sick. 
I dont know how many times my 
guidance counselor tried to talk 
me into being an investment 
banker or some other unsavory 
(to me, anyway) profession. Not 
all white, male, middle-class, 
young, and educated people en
joy all the benefits that you say 
weve got. In fact, many of us 
havent even got them.
I applaud your brief chronicle 
of facts about the plight of Afri
can-Americans in this nation. 
However, it would have been more 
fair and less discriminatory if you 
had pointed out the Hispanics 
Please see DISCRIMINATE, page 11
And so I appeal to The Tartan 
for action. No doubt the chances 
are slim that the University will 
fling open the safe and order the 
buses tomorrow, but hopefully 
someone will remember this need 
when it comes time to plan the 
Shuttle/Escort portion of the bud

Conservatives often refer to liberals as 
extremists. Splashing blood on people 
who wear furs. Axing all nukes. Lying in 
front of trucks to make a point ... no, 
sorry, thats the pro-lifers. But if you 
listen to some conservatives, theyre not 
all that different from those liberal flakes. 
Like this one, for instance.
So youre a conservative?
"Yup. And proud of it.
Let me ask you a couple of political 
questions.
Shoot.
How do you feel about raising taxes?
Taxes are already too high.
Why do you think theyre too high?
Because its my money, and the gov
ernment shouldnt be taking so much 
money from me so that I cant spend it on 
myself.
Should we raise defense spending?
Yes.
Why?
Because we need to keep our countrys 
defenses in shape and to replace equip
ment thats becoming obsolete.
Why?
In case we need to put a little muscle 
behind something.
Like Iraq?
Yeah.
Why are we in the Gulf?
To kick some butt and show that 
butthead Saddam that he shouldnt mess 
with the good ol U.S. of A. Plus, we need 
to nab some oil and contain aggression, 
stuff like that.
How can we raise defense spending 
and cut taxes at the same time?
Cut out that bleeding-heart liberal 
spending.
Such as?
Medicare. Welfare. AIDS research. 
Crap aimed at minorities and homos. No 
use to me.
What if you contracted AIDS?
Cant.
Why not?
Aint a fag.
Never mind. Why should we lower the 
capital gains tax?
So people with money can increase 
their investments, creating jobs, and so 
forth.
But these are people who earn over 
$200,000 a year. Shouldnt they pay as 
much, percentage-wise, as someone who 
makes $20,000 a year?
Milton Freidman says Im right.
Do you know who Milton Freidman is?
Nope.
Thought so. Some have likened the

trickle-down theory you just mentioned 
to feeding a horse. You feed the horse the 
finest hay at one end, and the feces that 
comes out of the other end is whats left 
for those who didnt get fed any hay.
Sounds about right. The horse repre
sents the rich guys, right? I guess thats 
pretty accurate. Neat way to look at it. 
How do you feel about abortion?
Im against abortion except in cases of 
rape and incest.
Why are you against abortion?
Its murder, and women use it like a 
form of birth control.
Hmph. What about rape and incest? 
What about it?
Why isnt it murder then?
Because ... because ... well, it ip. But 
its okay. I mean, if I were a woman, I 
wouldnt want to have a rapists kid. Bad 
gene pool.
But the babys still innocent no matter 
who the father is.
Well? Any comments?
Shut up.
Youre not related to Jesse Helms, are 
you?
I wish. God loves that man.
Somebody has to. Have you ever read 
Bloom County?
Tup. Hated it. That Breathed guy has 
no sense of humor. His name is obscene.
1 see. What exactly is obscene?
Anything with tit or more.
2 Live Crews lyrics dont show nudity.
But they talk about it, and anal in
tercourse and nasty stuff like that. They 
should be banned from producing music 
forever, taken into an alley, and shot.
Have you ever listened to their album 
to judge for yourself?
What? And subject myself to that 
smut?
Critics say that many of the objections 
to 2 Live Crews work are laced with 
racism.
Bunch of liars and nigger-lovers.
Nice argument. I can guess how you 
feel about the death penalty.
Fry em, I always say.
Some have said that the death penalty* 
is a Republicans idea of cheap hous
ing.
Now youre learning.
But after legal costs, the death penalty; 
tends to run more on average than,a 
sentence for life.
So lets start by executing the law. 
yers.
Should everyone have the right to own 
a gun?
Of course. That ones even in the 
Constitution.
Why do people need to own guns? , 
To hunt and for self-protection. 
Why does a hunter need handguns and 
assault rifles?
Ever tried to kill a squirrel? The suck
ers are fast. Its a hell of a lot easier to ltjll 
em with an automatic rifle or a grenade 
or some plastic explosives.
Thats not very sportsmanlike. .......
Yeah, but splatterin them is fun-as 
hell.
Can you still eat splattered squirrel? 
If you want. Makes great gumbo. 
Well.
Well.
[Silence.]
So youre a conservative?
Yup. And proud of it.

Id like to stray from my usual 
environmental agenda this week 
to discuss a topic about which I 
feel very deeply: the electoral 
process. Specifically, Id like to 
talk about the recently annulled 
Student Senate elections.
First of all, Id like to ask Sen
ate one question: Did you just 
forget about proper procedure or 
was there really conflict of inter
est involved here?
For if there really was conflict 
of interest, and the senators up 
for re-election were ignoringtheir 
own rules to try to gain advan
tages over their opponents, then 
they have violated the cardinal 
principle of democracy: rule by 
the people, not by individual 
persons. In this scenario, incum
bent senators manipulate the 
election process to serve their
Jeffrey Woodford
needsi.e., political power. This 
sort of devious influencing over 
the elections destroys the fair
ness of the election that each can
didate is entitled to and should 
not be tolerated. Alpha Phi 
Omega, the Election Committee 
for this election, had every right 
to annul the elections.
If the former is true, and Sen
ate simply forgot, then the annul
ment was justified as well. By 
delaying the elections and not re
membering the deadlines, Senate 
showed apathy and a general at
mosphere of procrastination of
holding the elections.
In this manner, Senate gives 
the impression that elections are 
not important, that Senate can 
afford to put them off with no 
extenuating repercussions. This 
attitude is totally wrong and 
should not be allowed to continue. 
If this scenario is in fact the cor
rect one, Senate should be told to 
get on the ball, so to speak, with 
election planning after this, 
annullment.
I do believe, however, that this 
scenario of procrastination is in 
fact what happened, with possi
bly a hint of the previous one 
thrown in by a few senators. I find 
it discouraging that Senate would, 
perhaps unknowingly, undermine 
an already troubled Senate elec
tion system. It has degraded into 
a popularity contest: In this past
election, in several colleges races, 
if one candidate had a bunch of 
friends who all voted for him/her, 
then that candidate would almost 
assuredly become a senator.
Elections as popularity contests 
belong in high school; elections as 
serious decisions by an educated 
electorate should be here at Car
negie Mellon, and Senate should, 
not interfere by breaking its o,\vn 
bylaws and sitting on its colle.c;, 
tive hands.
How odd it is that the arche
typal institution of democracy, on 
this campus, Student Senate,- 
shows such apathy toward the 
very process which keeps the de
mocracy alive  the Senate elec
tions.

Indifference of others incited fiery comments
SANTOS, from page 9 
the minority view and I, as the 
majority, rejectyour letter as gar
bage. If you propose such an idea, 
see how it is on the flip side. I 
learned this in a different way 
from my first letter. I dont think 
Sean has the right to speak for us 
and declare whats right to see 
in The Tartan. Mr. DeRoss should 
look at it the same way.
There is one more letter. Restifo 
and McGrath say they dont want 
to be stereotyped a3 sexist.> What 
was your motivation for this? If 
you put more energy into speak
ing out against people of other 
groups who have insulted the 
existence of white people or acted 
with violence towards you. Id be 
more concerned. I never heard of 
whites being stereotyped as sex
ist. It doesnt seem like a message 
of stereotyping, but a message to 
women that white males are okay 
to date. I would apologize to the 
fraternities, but they havent 
gotten their act together to do 
something positive for our cam
pus. They say The Tartan specifi
cally picks on fraternities in the' 
Crime & Incident Report. That
doesnt affect that they still com
mitted the?e acts, when they 
shouldnt be doing them at all.
Ill stress that these are my 
opinions, like them or not. I be
lieve I wrote them more fairly 
than last time. Im not going to 
preach to you. Yes, Im prejudiced. 
To what degree, I dont know. 
And yes, I havent still reached 
the point where I can admit who 
I am prejudiced against, but I 
know its there. Now, will any
body on this campus dare to write 
The Tartan and admit the same 
thing without the usual bull as
preaching and denial. Itll be the 
closest way to solving the prob
lem, if such a solution exists.
I learned my lesson with anger. 
This time, I feel my advice to grow 
up is backed up much better. Im 
trying to get rid of the anger. As I 
publicly admit something about 
myself to better the community, I  
hope everyone else shows me upby doing the same thing, but go
ing further. However, my predic
tion is that nothing happens.

Controversy dampens holiday spirit
If you havent heard about it 
already, Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie 
MaslofFannounced a plan to con
struct a holiday display without 
symbols that are or could be per
ceived as religious which has un
leashed the legal guns on Grant 
Street for another holiday sea
son. This plan eliminates  to 
the chagrin of most city residents
 the traditional Christmas tree 
and menorah at the entrance to 
the City-County Building.
Yuletide legal battles arent new 
to the mayor or to the city, and 
thats probably why Masloff de
cided to try to evade the legal 
issue. Court battles date back to 
1986, and the Supreme Court 
ruling that emerged when the 
smoke cleared was that Pitts
burgh couldnt put up a nativity 
scene because it was a religious 
symbol, but could display a 
Christmas tree and a menorah 
because those symbols are sup
posedly secular.
That option was not good 
enough for Masloff: She decided 
that if Pittsburgh couldnt have a 
nativity scene, then it couldnt 
have a menorah, either. Last year 
the menorah was erected only 
when the Jewish group Chabad 
House filed suit against the city 
and obtained a preliminary order 
allowing it to do so. The city and 
Chabad House settled the suit 
this fall with an agreement statMichael J. Ewedosh
ing that the city would not erect a 
Christmas tree or any other reli
gious holiday symbol in front of 
the building this year.
If this was Sophies attempt to 
make sure her legal staff didnt 
spend too much time thinking 
about Christmas trees this holi
day season, it failed: Councilman 
Baldy Regan has applied for a 
permit from the mayors office to 
erect a display that would include 
both a tree and menorah. 
Pittsburghs legal department 
examined the application last 
week and will make a recom
mendation to the mayor today. 
Regan has said that if the appli
cation is rejected, hell propose 
legislation to City Council that 
would authorize a private citizen 
to erect such a display.
In trying to keep the legal guns 
on Grant Street silent through
out this holiday season, Masloff s 
heart was in the right place but 
her head was in the sand. Last 
years compromise display of a 
menorah and a Christmas tree by 
the city was acceptable to those 
involved and was considered 
secular by the courts.
Meanwhile, Allegheny County 
has decided to keep with tradi
tion and is erecting a Christmas 
tree inside the courthouse. Its 
lawyers arent  and wont be  
tied up in court fighting over 
stringed popcorn, and citizens 
arent swamping the offices of the 
county commissioners with phone 
calls.
Pittsburghs holiday squabble 
is yet another government con
tradiction. Instead of putting up 
the symbols of peace, family, 
friendship, and goodwill  the 
symbols that this holiday season
 has come to represent  the city 
is contributing toward making 
those symbols the center of a con
troversy that does not really help 
anyone.
Pittsburghs solicitor says that 
she thinks Chabad wouldnt 
complain if the display was the 
same as it was last year: a tree 
and a menorah. If that is so, then 
why has Masloff changed it? 
Theres no need to fix something 
thats not broken. Sophies best 
move would be to move the tree 
and menorah onto the steps of the 
City-County Building. Neither are 
doing anyone any good in storage 
or in the headlines.
Michael J. Ewedosh is a junior 
IM major and wishes everyone a 
happy holiday, however it is cel
ebrated.

Just a few thoughts to close out the 
semester:
A state legislator in Massachusetts is 
,pparently planning to submit a bill as a 
response to the Milli Vanilli lip-synching 
andal. This bill would make it illegal 
for singers to pretend to be performing 
wiiile they are really only lip-synching 
someone elses work. That seems fair but 
Id like to see someone propose an 
amendment which would also make it 
illegal for legislators to have aides or 
colleagues cast votes for them.
 Im not really sure why so many 
consumers are so upset about Milli 
Vanilli anyway. Admittedly, the duo 
accepted its Grammy under false pre
tenses, but the sound of the music is still 
tile'Same as it was two weeks ago. I cant 
imagine changing my mind about 
whether I liked a song simply because I 
found out that it was performed by one
Did you ever have a hole in your 
pocket you knew about for a while 
that you never decided to sew 
until you lost something that you 
had put in it, be it money or 
something of sentimental value? 
Its becoming costly to continue 
do that any longer.
We have finals to study for, in
terviews to worry about, and 
holiday presents to buy for our 
families. So we dont have time to 
worry about little things like holes 
our pockets, right?
Wrong. We must make time.

group of people I had never met instead 
of another.
It seemed kind of ironic that 13 for
eign ministers would fly from all over the 
world to meet at the United Nations and 
vote on a crisis whose key point is that 
there is not enough fuel available in the 
world.
I have to applaud SDC for being dar
ing enough to conclude Sex Week by 
giving a couple a night in a hotel. How
ever, it seems like it would have been 
more appropriate to give ten couples an 
hour each.
 Its not often that I or anyone else has
to say this, but dean of Student Affairs 
Mike Murphy screwed up. Its very nice 
of him to provide SDC with enough money 
to send the Suitcase Dance winners to a 
New York hotel rather than one in Pitts
burgh but it would have been nicer if he 
had done itbeforehe started gettingcalls 
from parents.
Despite the fact that I agree with 
Mayor Sophie Masloffs decision not to 
put a Christmas tree and menorah on 
the City Hall steps, I hope the City Law 
Department gives City Councilman Ber
nard Baldy Regan permission to do it 
himself as a private citizen.
Its hard to define a religion so such a 
decision would open up all sorts of pos
sibilities for the rest of us private 
citizens. Once Regan puts up his Christ
mas tree and menorah, everything is fair 
game.
For example, do you worship beer? If
Do you worship beer? If you do, why not put 
up a giant bottle of Budweiser on your lawn or 
rooftop?
you do, why not put up a giant bottle of 
Budweiser on your lawn or rooftop? 
Theres a guy at Wrigley Field in Chicago 
who preaches the Gospel of the Cubs. 
How about putting a giant Cubs batting 
helmet on the steps of the Pittsburgh 
City HaH?
People wouldnt even have to make up 
religions to get in on the fun. I am sure a 
Satanist symbol at City Hall would get 
Mayor Masloff even more phone calls 
than she has gotten over not putting up 
a Christmas tree and menorah.
So sometime in the next few weeks
when you need to relieve stress, find 
yourself a religion and call Mayor 
Masloffs office (255-2626) or the City 
Law Department (255-2015) and ask for 
an application to put up your own display. 
If they give you any trouble, just call the 
City Council office (255-2142) and ask to 
speak with Regan. Im sure he would be 
happy to help you during the holiday

of us  hurrying here and there, 
trying to keep up with this or that 
that we really dont even bother 
to take time to worry about holes.. 
Yet if we dont sew up that hole 
in our pocket, we will keep losing 
things until we have nothing left 
to lose anymore. Im afraid thats 
going to happen to a lot of us.
Ever since Sophie Masloff was 
elected mayor, she had been the 
butt of jokes for residents of 
Pittsburgh. She had a rather large 
hole in her pocket that has re
cently grown bigger.
Masloff decided that City Hall 
would not display any religious 
holiday memorabilia, making her 
an even bigger target of cynicism 
and criticism. In stead of making 
things better, she has made the 
hole in her pocket bigger.
Friendship is one of the things 
we hold in our pockets. Old friends 
will soon be gone if we do not do
something about it before it is too 
late. Sending a card or giving them 
a call will say a lot. New friends 
will slowly be slipping away from 
us as well if we dont take the time 
to be a friend to them in return.
Now, amidst the holiday season, 
it is a good time to let your friends 
know how much you appreciate 
them so that hole in your pocket 
does not get bigger.
After all, little things, even 
holes, really do mean a lot.

Discrimination hides in the minds subconscious
DISCRIMINATE, from page 9
and other ethnic groups, not to 
mention all the white people, who 
have tens of thousands of 
fhtefr members in the same de;d${iit condition. Recent declines 
in'affordable housing and health 
care, federal cuts in numerous 
social programs, disintegrating 
urban and suburban infrastruc
tures, a rising consumer price in
dex, under-staffed and under
equipped public schools, and the 
lack of affordable daycare affect 
everybody Mr. Silver, not just 
e below the poverty level. 
Iveheardmy parents gripe about 
cost of living. Ive heard my 
mother complain about the need 
for more up-to-date facilities and 
lack of space in the high school 
where she works (which happens 
to be in another upper-middleclass community, by the way). 
.Some of your claims happen to 
be incredibly ludicrous. Classify
ing the United States as a domi
nant social formation that always 
jhas and still continues to function 
in the interests of a white, male, 
ruling class is incredibly naive. 
All government officials  
elected, appointed, or volunteers
 all take an oath that begins I 
do solemnly swear (or affirm) that 
I will support and defend the 
Constitution of the United 
States, not one that begins by 
pledging to save the white, male, 
ruling class. Have you ever read 
the Constitution, Mr. Silver? 
Hopefully somewhere in the pur
suit of Literary and Cultural 
Theory there is time to study the 
best blueprint for a free society 
the world has yet to write. Your 
claim of whether or not AfricanAmerican women and men should 
risk  -tting blown to pieces in a 
war that promises to preserve a 
way of life inextricably linked 
with black poverty is false to the 
extreme. About 40 percent of the 
total-force structure of the U.S. 
Armed Forces come from what 
are typified as minorities. The 
rest of them are mostly white, 
male, middle-class, young, and 
educated people who will bleed 
and die the same way as their 
minority counterparts. You are 
obviously blind to the fact that no 
matter what the background of a 
serviceman (to include women too) 
is, he or she volunteered to serve. 
Nobody forced them to undertake
the .obligation they.no w hold. They 
also took an oath to protect the 
Constitution, not the white, male, 
ruling class. You degrade them 
by claiming as such. .
Mr. Silver is trapped in 
dreamland if he thinks that my 
Americanist approach to elimi
nating discrimination is some sort 
of fascist or masculinist plot to 
insure American domination of 
the world. In no way did I ever 
suggest such a disgusting 
premise. It would be impossible 
for us to suggest to that we end 
discrimination on a world basis 
until we fix our own problems. We 
must set the example. The easiest 
way to do this is to concentrate 
our appreciation of the men and 
women along side of us on the 
basis that we are all Americans 
and therefore alike. Once we reach 
this point, then we can tell the 
world that discrimination should 
end by the sole virtue that we are 
all humans and citizens of the 
planet Earth and therefore alike.
This is not an overnight pro
cess, Mr. Silver. If we start now, 
three or four generations down 
the road we might have fixed our 
own nation. In three or four more,
hopefully we can unite the world. 
President John F. Kennedy once 
wrote, The future promise of any 
nation is determined by the 
present prospects of its 
youth....What really matters is 
the children. If we are going to 
end discrimination, we must start 
by trying to change the attitudes 
of some members of our genera
tion because we will educate the 
next. We are still a part of the 
worlds youth. The future prom
ise of humanity rests in our hands 
now but we will pass it soon 
enough to our sons and daugh
ters. Once again Mr. Silver, what 
will come is up to us. I can accept 
and appreciate your existence and 
rights as an American and as a 
human. I might not agree with 
you, but you are the same as me, 
and I cannot degrade that in 
anybody. Can you accept every
body in the same way? I hope so, 
because you, me, and all the rest 
of our generation hold the fragile 
future of our species and our 
planet in our young and inexpe
rienced hands.

ther name....
Last weekend, the Carnegie 
ellon womens basketball 
ai)i hosted its Thanksgiving 
)Umament. The fans were 
bated to a taste of the bizarre 
the competition included the 
jram Lady Terriers, the 
kvarthmore Garnets, and the 
omona-Pitzer Sagehens.
This dose of surrealism got 
e thinking about the nickunes that schools give their 
ams. It also made me lose 
at night wondering just 
Sait the hell a Sagehen was.
The Presidents Athletic 
onferencc was a nice confer
ee to be a part of. At the time 
e left, we competed against 
Bethany Bisons, Thiel 
micats, and Grove City 
rolverines. All normal names, 
eck. Wolverines was even the 
ime of my high school critterchoice.
However, the Washington & 
fefferson Presidents destroyed 
serenity. Teams with a 
storical theme are a nice 
ought, but theres no real 
hcrete mascot to rally behind, 
herefore, quite pointless.
In the University Athletic 
ssociation, only three schools 
into the safe category  
mory University (Eagles),
Jase Western (Spartans), and 
University of Rochester 
Mowjackets). Good, wholeime, warlike names that 
'eryone can live with.

Does it really matter what 
leir bears are doing? They 
uld be playing Scrabble or 
atching A Current Affair for 
111 care. We still won the UAA 
otball title.
in the case of Johns Hopkins 
diversity, the problem lies in 
egrees of severity. Birds

After a disheartening80-53 loss 
to Franklin & Marshall, Tartan 
Head Coach Gerri Seidls greatest 
concern was that her team would 
lose confidence in itself and play 
would suffer as a result. Five 
straight wins later, it looks as if 
she had little to worry about.
The latest Tartan win came 
Friday night as Carnegie Mellon 
beat the Violets of New York 
University, 58-46. The win raised 
the Tartans overall record to 61, 
which includes a perfect 2-0 mark 
in the University Athletic Asso
ciation.
The Tartans received help in 
Friday nights victory as the Vio
lets shot an ice-cold .282 from the 
floor, including an even worse .222 
second half clip.
The game started out as any
thing but a blowout; the greatest 
lead either team held in the first 
half was a mere four points. 
Carnegie Mellon shot better (.433 
vs. .333), but the Violets shot more 
(42 attempts vs. 30). When junior 
forward Amy Buxbaum hit a 
buzzer-beater to make the halftime score 29-28 in favor of the 
Tartans, it looked as if the Tartans 
were in for a nail-biter.
The Tartans went into the locker 
room with an interesting scoring 
quirk: the forwards  freshman 
Jeanine Megahan, sophomore 
Chandra Buist, and Buxbaum  
had accounted for all 29 points. 
The trio ended up with a combined 
47 points  81 percent of the 
Tartan scoring.
The second half featured a bi
zarre strategy by Seidl. All five 
second half startersBuxbaum, 
Buist, Megahan, and junior 
guards Heather ODonnell and 
Bridget Eperthener played the 
entire 20 minutes. As it turns out, 
the strategy worked brilliantly as 
the Tartan defense held NYU to 
only 18 points in the second half 
I didnt start the second half 
with the intention of not substi
tuting, said Head Coach Gerri 
Seidl, but I felt the five that were 
out there were clicking. We had 
tried a lot of different combina
tions in the first half and had a lot 
of trouble finding one that worked.
I felt we played a lot better 
team basketball in the second half 
They created opportunities for 
each other and didnt force things. 
Buxbaum had another expla
nation for the teams second half 
success. The key was defensive 
rebounding, she said. In the first 
half, we allowed too many second 
shots, and they scored a lot that 
way. We tightened up in the sec
ond half and held them. 
Megahan and Buist shared the 
scoring lead with 16 points each 
while Buxbaum followed with 15 
points. ODonnell and Eperthener 
accounted for the remaining 
Tartan scores with six and five 
points, respectively. Buist and 
Buxbaum led Tartan rebounding 
with 13 and 10, respectively.
Wednesday night, the Tartans 
won their closest game of the year, 
beating Washington & Jefferson 
on the road, 50-42. Although the 
Tartans have departed the PresiPlease see WOMEN, page 15

Head swimming coach Bruce Bronsdon 
tries to use each meet as a step forward in 
improvement.
The Carnegie Mellon mens and womens 
teams took a giant leap forward last week
end when the teams swam better this 
season than last season in the University 
Athletic Association Invitational at New 
York University, with the men coming in 
first with 111 points and the women fin
ishing third with 74 points.
The teams also swam well last Wednes
day against Westminster but lost both 
meets 145102 (men) andl28-77(women).
Since NYUs pool is in meters (CMU 
usually swims in pools measured in yards), 
the only way for Bronsdon to judge his 
teams performance was by its places 
against the three other schools (NYU, Case 
Western Reserve, and Rochester Univer
sity). CMU took seven first places and two 
pool records against competition which 
included All-Americans.
Junior Brian Zimmerman won the 1500 
meter free style, 200 meter freestyle, and 
the 400 meter freestyle. Senior Paul Moran 
won the 100 meter backstroke and 200 
meter backstroke. Moran and Zimmerman 
combined their talents along with fresh
man Todd Vandall and junior Norm 
Murray in winning an exciting 400 meter 
freestyle relay.
Zimmerman set pool records in the 1500 
meter freestyle; the relay team also set a 
pool record. For the women, senior Leslie 
McGill won the 200 meter backstroke.
In the Westminster meet on Wednesday, 
Bronsdon observed improvement of his team 
over this time last year but noted 
Westminster became very strong since last 
year, losing only one senior and gaining 
many strong freshmen.
Winning men swimmers for CMU this 
meet were Zimmerman in the 200 yard 
freestylle and the 500 yard freestyle, 
Vandall in the 200 yard butterfly, and 
sophomore Jaime Millar in the 200 yard 
breaststroke. The mens medley relay

Freshman Micahel Hosni tries to get open for a pass against NYU.
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team suffered its sec
ond overtime loss of the season 
Friday, losing to New York Uni
versity by a score of 81-73. The 
Tartans were outscored 12-4 in 
the overtime period as they 
dropped to 02 in the University 
Athletic Association and a 1-3 
overall mark.
Freshman Michael Hosni led 
the Tartans with a 22-point ef
fort, which included 18 in the sec
ond half. Freshman center Derek 
Dragisich and sophomore forward 
Lamman Rucker also reached 
double figures in scoring with 17 
and 12 points, respectively.
Although the Violets looked on 
paper to be the stronger team, the 
Tartans came out front early be
hind a 125 run. The Violets held 
close until a 92 Tartan run put 
them up by 13, 31-19, with 4:34 
left in the half. The Violets man
aged to put together a six-point 
run late in the half, but went to 
the half trailing 3828.
Halftime was the worst thing 
that could have happened to us, 
said Dragisich. We had to sit for 
a while, and I think we tightened 
up. NYU put a press on us in the 
second half, and that ended up
being the difference.
Early in the second half, the 
Tartans were hit hard by fouls 
with six in the first five minutes 
of the period. As a result, the 
Violets were able to tie the game 
at 40 with 14:34 on the clock. 
However Hosni scored nine points 
in a three minute stretch to hold 
off the surging Violets, and backto-back Hosni baskets put the 
Tartans up by seven with 7:40 
left.
Unfortunately, the Violets 
chopped six points off the Tartan 
lead in a little over a minute, 
setting the stage for the games 
climax. The Tartans, down 67-66 
took timeout with 1:58 remaining 
and proceeded to take the lead 
back with a Dragisich basket and 
a foul shot by junior Chris Dobbs. 
Roosevelt Smith, NYUs high 
scorer with 27 points, drove the 
lane with 24 seconds on the clock 
to tie the game at 69; the Tartans 
were unable to get the game-winner in the final seconds and had 
to play their second overtime con
test of the year.
Unfortunately, the extra period 
went almost completely for NYU. 
Dragisich matched the Violets 
score for score the first two times 
to knot the game, 7373, but the 
Violets finished the last three 
minutes with eight unanswered
points.
Earlier in the week, the Tar
tans won their first game of the 
season by holding on to beat Thiel, 
69-64, at home on Tuesday night. 
The Tartans held a 14-point lead 
at halftime, but were outscored 
38-29 in the second half.
The first half was mostly even 
 the largest lead either team 
held in the first 10 minutes was 
five points. However, Carnegie 
Mellon went on an 18-4 tear over 
the next seven minutes to take a 
16 point lead with time running 
out in the half.
Thiel added a pair of baskets to 
close to within 12, but sophomore 
Dan Erhard scored with 53 sec
onds left to provide the 40-26 
halftime margin.
Carnegie Mellon looked as if it 
was going to ice the game at the 
start of the second half, but Thiel 
scored eight straight points, in
cluding back-to-back threepointers by junior Juan Bravo, to 
remain within seven. The Tar
tans pushed the lead back into 
double digits over the next seven 
minutes until Thiel made an 11- 
2 run that made the score 62-58 
with 4:16 remaining.
Hosni and Rucker scored to 
push the lead back to eight, but 
Thiel came back to within two

A little more than one-third of 
the NHL season has expired. 
Currently, we find the New York 
Rangers and the Chicago 
Blackhawks at the top of the 
league.
The Rangers are at the top of 
the Patrick Division and the NHL 
with 37 points. Their record is 
16-6-5 and they are tied for the 
league lead in goals scored with 
107.
The Rangers goaltending has 
been magnificent with John 
Vanbiesbrouck and Mike Richter 
sharing the job. The two of them 
have combined for a 2.44 goals 
against average (second in the 
NHL) and a .926 save percentage 
(first in the NHL).
Second-year player Darren 
Turcotte has provided most of the 
offensive punch with 13 goals and 
20 assists for 33 total points. 
Turcotte is currently tied for sixth 
in the NHL in scoring. He is fol
lowed by defenseman Brian 
Leetch (seven goals, 25 assists, 
32 points) and center Bernie
THE PUCK 
STOPS HERE
by Allan Bourdius
Nicholls (nine goals, 19 assists, 
28 points).
Unfortunately for the Rangers, 
they have just lost two key play
ers. Left wing Jan Erixon sprained 
his knee and will be out for at 
least four to six weeks. Erixon is 
one of the toughest-playing de
fensive forwards in the Patrick 
Division.
The Rangers usually match him 
up against players like Wayne 
Gretzky or Steve Yzerman to limit 
their range and production. 
Defenseman Mark Hardy just 
began a five-game suspension. 
These two absences from the
Ranger lineup leave a significant 
hole in the Ranger defense.
The Rangers misfortune in the 
injury department spells oppor
tunity for the two teams chasing 
them: the Philadelphia Flyers 
(16-10-1,33 points) and the New 
Jersey Devils (13-10-1, 27 
points).
The Flyers are the NHLs 
miracle team this season. Nobody, 
including me, expected the Flyers 
to be as good as they are, espe
cially not with key players Tim 
Kerr, Mark Howe, Jeff Chychrun, 
Ken Wregget, and Ron Hextall 
currently injured.
The New Jersey Devils have 
played very well this season, al
though certainly not up to their 
potential. The bright star for the 
Devils so far has been Americanborn goaltender Chris Terreri. 
Terreri has a 2.68 goals against 
average and a .900 save percent
age.
While he is in the net, the Devils 
are 10-5-0. Backup goaltender 
Sean Burke, once expected to be

the starter, is just 3-5-1 and has 
given up 37 goals in just nine 
games played, compared to 40 
goals allowed in 15 games for 
Terreri. The Devils lack confi
dence playing in front of Burke 
and he is discontented with being 
the number two man in goal. The 
Devils would be better off trading 
Burke and using either Rollie 
Melanson or .Craig Billington as 
their backup goalie.
The Chicago Blackhawks play 
has centered almost totally on 
defense. The addition of Chris 
Chelios to their squad of blueliners
has made a marked improvement 
in the Hawks defense. However, 
the real story of the Blackhawks 
lies in their goaltending.
Rookie Ed Belfour has appeared 
in 22 games for Chicago. He is 
currently the best netminder in 
the NHL with a record of 15-5-1, 
2.02 goals against, and .921 save 
percentage. In those 22 games, he 
has allowed only 40 goals.
Elsewhere around the league, 
players are excelling in their own 
ways. St. Louis Blues right wing 
Brett Hull is the goal-scoring 
leader by 6 with 23 goals.
Pittsburghs John Cullen is thei 
assists leader with 33.
Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings is the overall leading 
scorer with 45 points (15 goals, 3o 
assists). A1 Maclnnis of;tfre 
Calgary Flames is the current 
plus-minus leader with a rating 
of 18. Minnesota North Stars 
right wing Shane Churla is the 
NHLs naughty boy with 143 
penalties in minutes.

my heart and not my head, so I 
took the Eagles and happened 
upon another .500 week  the 
second this semester, and hope
fully the last.
By now, you should know that 
all the division leaders lost last 
week. I would never have pre
dicted such a thing to happen, not 
with the dominance of the Niners 
over everyone else, but it figures.
Because this will be my last
rather than do next Sundays 
games predictions, Im going to 
take a few games from each of the 
remaining four weeks which I feel 
are important and tell you who 
will win  just dont put money 
on it.
First off, we have tonights 
game, for which I truly dread 
having to pick a winner, but I 
cant duck a Monday night game 
with the importance to both teams 
(particularly New York) that this 
one has. The hype was killed a 
week ago when both of them lost 
games, as did the ratings.
San Francisco has been winning 
games by the skin of its teeth, and 
the loss to the Los Angeles Rams 
was at Candlestick, where theyll 
be playing tonight. The Giants 
have taken a few close games, but 
normally they have dominated 
whoever they played. The Eagles
column before semesters end, caught them asleep at the wheelSwimmers improve 
upon last season
last week. The Niners wont  
Giants 24, 49ers 20.
This Sunday, the Redskins take 
on the Bears in a do or die for the 
Skins. The Bears have been play
ing pretty good football (exclud
ing their massacre at the hands of 
the Vikings), and of late, the Skins 
have not. I know someone wholl 
kill me for this, but... Bears 27, 
Redskins 13.
Suddenly, the downtrodden 
Vikings are in the playoff picture. 
Playing at New Jersey against 
the Giants should prove their 
undoing  New York 31, Minne
sota 23. Cincinnati needs a win to 
remain competitive in the playoff 
picture, with a hot Houston 
chasing them.
The Niners cant seem to lose 
on the road (they havent lost a 
road game since the early 88), 
and have victimized the Bengals 
throughout recent years  San
Francisco 34, Cincy 28.
Can Philadelphia hold on to 
their playoff hopes? Against the 
Dolphins the Eagles will need one 
of their better performances, es
pecially on the ground  Eagles 
21, Dolphins 17.
Next Saturday, the New York 
Giants take on the Buffalo Bills. 
Both lead their divisions as of 
Saturday, and will both be highly 
probable playoff teams. More 
important for the Bills, the game 
should be a decent one  Giants
27, Bills 24.
The Bengals take on the Raid
ers on Sunday the 16th. This game 
could kill either team  Raiders 
34, Bengals 21. Kansas City hosts 
the Houston Oilers the same day. 
Both games have major implica
tions in both the AFC Central and 
West divisions. I take Houston 
28-17.
The weekend before Christmas
there are three particularly im
portant games, especially for the 
AFC Central division. The 
Steelers host the Browns and the 
Bengals are guests to the Oilers. 
Take the Steelers over the Browns 
by 20, the Oilers by 10 to set up 
the next weeks match-up between 
the Steelers and Oilers.
And in the AFC East, Miami 
travels to what should be cold 
Buffalo near the end of December. 
Miami took one game from the 
Bills. Can they take another? I 
say no  Bills 21, Dolphins 13.
And in the NFLs final week of 
the regular season, only one game 
truly stands out at this point. The 
Steelers play at the House of 
Pain against the Oilers for what 
may turn out to be the division 
championship. Houston has 
turned it on in the last half of the 
season, but can they handle the 
Steelers?
Its another Sunday night on: 
ESPN game, as was their first! 
game, which the Steelers wonbig.! 
Dont expect another good mar-! 
gin, but expect the Steelers to win: 
37-34. Buffalo and Washington! 
face off, both teams possibly still 
trying to pin down a playoff spot 
(particularly Washington). Buf
falo 24, Washington 17.
And finally, out in the AFCi 
West, the Raiders and Chargerai 
meet, either to lock the Raiders 
into the playoffs, or for the f/l 
wild card position. Either'W, 
take the Raiders at home 3F-27.
And so, with this last conglSmeration of predictions, I leave you 
to your finals and football. And 
who knows? Maybe Ill continue 
to make some sort-of predictions 
next semester.

psychology major.

Since it is now early in the sea
son for the Carnegie Mellon 
swimming teams Bronsdon 
wishes to filter out weakness in 
his team.
Each meet at this point of the 
year is a step forward, Bronsdon 
said. [It is] a trial and error 
process to find the weakness you 
have each meet.... We try and 
learn something every meet.

Women cruise 
to 6-1 start
WOMEN, from page 13
dents Athletic Conference, the 
rivalry was just as fierce as al
ways-Unfortunately, the game was 
plagued by sloppy play and even 
iVOrse officiating. Those refs were 
aWful, said Seidl. We should 
iave brought our football pads. 
They [W&J] were really killing us 
out there.
The Tartans controlled the first 
If with runs of 11-2 and 8-2, 
and they went to halftime ahead 
31-20. A 10-2 W&J run sand
wiched between the two Tartan 
uns..and several Tartan turn
overs kept the game from getting 
even further out of hand.
The Tartans struggled near the 
middle of the second half, allowW&J to move within four 
joints, 43-39 with just under six 
ninutes left. A pair of baskets by 
enior Marybeth Armstrong, who 
edthe Presidents with 11 points, 
jeyed the W&J attack, and the 
residents Kelly Stacey moved 
V&Jto within a basket with 4:07 
Fortunately, the Tartans held 
ugh until the final minute when 
V&J was forced to foul to get the 
jallback. Buxbaum andMegahan 
iach hit a pair of free throws in 
ihe final seconds to extend the 
artan lead to the final margin of 
victory.
Megahan led the Tartan attack 
vith 13 points, while junior Katie 
iahey followed with 11 points, 
toxbaum led all rebounders with 
.5' boards; Megahan added anithei10.
Over Thanksgiving break, the 
'artans hosted and took the 
ihampionship of their Thanksjving Tournament. Carnegie 
ilellon knocked off the Hiram
Lady Terriers, 71-57, in the 
opening round and routed 
Pomona-Pitzer, 75-48, in the 
championship.
Megahan, who would be named 
to the all-tournament team, led 
the Tartans against Hiram with 
21 points, while Buxbaum pulled 
down a season-high 16 rebounds 
in addition to her 10 points. Fahey, 
who would go on to be the tour
nament MVP, notched 17 more 
points to help the Tartans cause.
In the final, four Tartans 
reached double-digit point totals, 
led by Fahey with 20. Buxbaum, 
ODonnell, and sophomore Kelly 
Sterling each scored 10 points. 
However the star player of the 
game was Pomona-Pitzers Caryn 
Cranston, a all-tournament team 
selection who scored 27 points 
and pulled down 14 rebounds.
The Tartans only other action 
of the last two weeks was a 6847 
UAA win against Case Western 
Reserve University. Megahan led 
the Tartans in their home opener 
with 23 points and 13 rebounds 
while Buxbaum added 12 points 
and 14 rebounds. The Tartans got 
help from the Spartans, who shot 
a feeble .194 in the second half.
The Tartans have a pair of home 
games this weekTuesday night 
against Allegheny College, and 
Saturday against Juniata College 
 before the winter break. Ac
cording to Seidl, theres always 
some concern about taking a 
month off, but its part of our 
schedule and theres nothing we 
can do about it.
Weve had difficulty [coming 
back from break] in the past, 
said Buxbaum, but if we can keep 
in shape and keep our rhythm, we 
should be all right.

MEN, from page 13
with 1:23 left. The Tartans put the game 
away on free throws as sophomore Todd 
Jenkins and Dragisich scored to preserve 
the Tartan victory.
Rucker and Dragisich led the Tartans in 
scoring with 18 points each. Rucker had a 
shot at 20, but it was ruled that time ran out 
before his final layup left his hand. Dragisich 
also led the Tartans in rebounds with 11.
Over Thanksgiving vacation, the Tartans 
lost their season opener against Case West
ern and dropped a one-point overtime decision 
against Pomona-Pitzer College.
In the Tartans 1990 debut, the Tartans fell 
short against Case Western Reserve Univer
sity, 79-75. The Spartans shot .582 in the 
game, but the Tartans played a much stronger 
second half and briefly held the lead late in the 
game. Hosni scored 21 points to lead the Tar
tans; Dragisich followed with 18. Ed Saxon, an 
all-conference guard last season, led the Spar
tans with 29 points, and forward GregBadowski 
added 27.
Pomona-Pitzer featured another hotshooting offense (.536), but the Tartans were 
once again able to make a game of it, coming 
back from a six-point halftime deficit to force 
overtime. Dragisich tallied 20 points and 15 
rebounds to lead the Tartans attack; Rucker 
finished with 12 points.
I think inexperience is our biggest prob
lem, said Dragisich. We've gotten ahead in 
games but havent had the killer instinct to 
put them away. That problem should go 
away with time.

"Lots of campuses are talking internationalization/' says 
Peter Stearns, head of the History Department and chair of the 
new University Committee on International Awareness.
Carnegie Mellon is no exception. Stearns' new committee 
hopes to get students involved in activities that will be enjoy
able and, at the same time, educate students about foreign 
cultures and the international forces behind current events.
"Many students don't know much about things beyond the 
United States, and given the positions they are likely to obtain 
in later life, they should," says Stearns. Because Carnegie 
Mellon hasn't had some of the international programs that can 
be found at other universities, "We have some serious ground 
to make up," Stearns says.
One example is the absence of an anthropology depart
ment here. "We don't have an anthropology department, and 
anthropology focuses specifically on introducing students to 
different cultures," Stearns says.
Recently, both the study abroad programs and foreign 
language opportunities have been expanding, but in the past a 
CMU student who wanted to participate in programs with an 
international flair had to search long and hard.
The committee stems from a recommendation from the 
International Committee of the Dean's Council regarding 
international awareness. It is also a result of President 
Mehrabian's expressed interest in giving students at CMU a 
better understanding of international issues and diverse 
cultures.
According to Director of International Education Victor 
Thacker, less than 2 percent of the students currently attending 
CMU get a chance to study abroad. Hopefully the Committee 
on International Awareness will fill in the gap.
The Committee on International Awareness will develop a 
fall festival, which it hopes to make as interesting to students 
as Spring Carnival. According to Thacker, they might schedule 
this weekend festival sometime towards the end of October so 
that it will coincide with United Nations Day on October 24.
Although the committee wasn't given a time frame, Stearns 
hopes to get the bulk of its report done this academic year, 
which will allow for a sufficient amount of planning for next 
fall.
"We would like to start with something that would be 
really interesting and a serious endeavor. The other tasks, 
deciding on other activities to recommend and mechanisms we 
want to recommend for sustaining them, will be dealt with 
later. They're all interrelated," Stearns says.
The primary goals for the fall festival, he says, are to 
sponsor "activities that help CMU students become more 
aware of international developments. These activities should 
give students a richer array of extracurricular activities." 
Another goal will be to use the knowledge that international 
students have about their own society to help inform and 
entertain other students, and in the process make these stu
dents feel more a part of things.
The committee is debating the idea of focusing the festival 
on one particular region of the world, rather than taking the 
more common approach of an international smorgasbord. In 
that case, during the weeks before and after a weekend festival, 
it might sponsor talks and symposia dealing with issues in that 
region such as education, schooling, and sexuality. "We also 
hope to encourage the arts departments to do something in 
way of performances or exhibits that would link to the theme
of the festival.," Stearns says.
The committee has also asked the campus community to 
suggest anything that might add to the festival. "We think it 
should have some competitive element, perhaps artistic 
displays, perhaps dances, some possible debate activity," says 
Stearns. "So far we don't have a literal equivalent of buggy, but 
we're looking for some activity that would have a similar 
flavor in terms of calling for student initiative and getting some 
students heavily involved."
Steams says his committee has gotten some response from 
the campus, but is especially interested in getting input from 
students. "We don't want a situation where the administration 
wants this and everybody else doesn't," says Thacker. 'That 
would just be a waste of money." He hopes that student input 
and a competitive element will draw student interest.
The members of the committee are faculty members Ilker 
Baybars, James Hoburg, Barbara Lazarus, Barbara MacKenziej 
Wood, Natalie Ozeas, and Peter Stearns; administrators Kyle i 
Fisher, Bob Kail, Michael Murphy, and Victor Thacker; and 
students Malini Agarwaal, Margaret O'Toole, and Vivek 
Raghavan. If all goes well, by next fall, the students of Carnegie 
Mellon will have a Fall "Spring Carnival" and will be sharpenj 
ing their knowledge of the world in which we live.

Ed. Note Azleena Salleh is a freshman in H&SS, and her home 
is in Malaysia. In this article, she gives a firsthand account of what it 
is like to live in Malaysia and attend a university here.
When you write about your country, what do you say 
first? Especially if most Americans either:
a) have heard very little about it, or
b) have never heard of it before and therefore don't know 
what to think.
Well first of all, for those who are in the (a) category, I'll 
dispel some myths about Malaysia.
No, Malaysia is not in Africa. It's actually in another 
tropical portion of the Big, Blue Marble down in South East 
Asia. It's squeezed in between Thailand, the Philippines, 
Indonesia, and Singapore (the wee island to the south), and 
measures around 127-300 square miles (4/5 the size of Califor
nia).
No, it's not all jungle and man-eating wild animals. Believe 
it or not, we have southeastern Asia's tallest building, one of 
the region's best road networks, and the third longest bridge in 
the world connecting Penang Island to the Peninsula. True, 
most of Malaysia is forest, especially the Eastern part located 
on the huge island of Borneo where we have one of the world's 
largest tropical forests. And a few small native cultures still 
insist on being left undisturbed in their corner of East Malay
sia. However, the urban, cosmopolitan areas in the West 
Peninsula don't lack their fair share of high-rise buildings and 
modern conveniences. The shopping in Malaysia is frustratingly cheap as well (in the U.S. dollar, that is). I have my 
shopping bills to prove that.
And for those who come under the (b) category, I'll give 
you some facts to think about.
Malaysia is in the tropical belt of the world, just missing 
the equator by a few degrees. As a result, it gets an ample 
supply of sunny, humid weather all year long.
Due to the influx of Chinese and Indian immigrants, who 
were attracted by the growing tin and rubber trade way back 
during the British Occupation, Malaysia's population is 32-35% 
Chinese and 8-10% Indian (in addition to other nationalities). 
The remaining 55% are the original natives of the land, the 
Malays and several smaller ethnic groups.
From what I've observed, visitors to Malaysia find her 
cultural blend very 'exotic'. I know advertisements and travel 
brochures on Malaysia seethe with the word. Makes me 
wonder, though. Somehow, my daily routine did not seem 
very 'exotic' to me. After all, I didn't go to school in a bullock 
cart or trishaw, garbed in a batik sarong with a bright red 
hibiscus in my hair...
When I think about what Malaysia is all about, I have to 
look beyond the 'tropical paradise' theme and tell you that it 
also includes mosquitoes (those *@!# blood-sucking insects that 
come in hordes and wail incessantly into your ear like police 
sirens all night long), killer mini-buses (irresistible for those 
who have always wanted to ride a roller-coaster in rush-hour 
traffic), sweating/perspiring/glowing (depending on whether 
you're an animal, man, or woman) in the heat and humidity, 
getting lost and/or stranded (there's a rumor that underneath 
the chaos in our public transportation, there is actually a 
system behind it all), and an overall confused state-of-mind.
Why confused, you ask? Well, that's what happens when 
many different cultures, beliefs, traditions, and what-have-you 
are lumped in a blender, with no predominant culture. Cul
tural chaos like no other.
Take a walk down the street, for example. Besides the 
different types of ethnic food being sold in the road-side stalls, 
people dress, act and speak differently. Chinese speak their 
various dialects, Malays speak Malay (the National Language 
and the medium of instruction in schools), and Indians speak 
Tamil most often. When they communicate with each other, 
the result is something uniquely Malaysian. They speak a very
colloquial Malay mixed with English, plus a dash of 
idiosyncratic ethnic flair from the language they 
normally speak.
And if a you are truly, truly Malaysianized, you 
should be stuck with a uniquely Malaysian tendency 
to use the 'lah' suffix. It's a little quirk of the Malay 
language used for emphasis or when you're trying to 
persuade someone of something. No-lah, it's not a 
swear word. You can use it almost all the time-lah. If you can 
give your 'lah' the expression of helpless exasperation you use 
when you're trying to persuade your parents of something 
("No, Mommm, I can't be seen in school wearing that"), then 
you've just made your cultural discovery of the day. Talking 
like that can get rather addictive, actually. It's true-lah. Ask any 
Malaysian.
There's also something I've noticed about the difference 
between the cultural diversity of America and that of Malaysia. 
I've noticed that second generation Asians here tend to become 
Americanized to blend in with the crowd. They're not as softspoken in class, definitely more daring in their attitude and 
fashions, and all use American slang. This surprised me at first, 
because the Asians I knew back home are fiercely proud of 
their culture and language and I thought it would apply here 
as well. Generally over here, you can tell which Asian students 
are from Asia and which ones grew up here just by talking to 
them on the phone because of the absence (or presence) of 
American slang.
Another thing that struck me when I first arrived here was 
the system of education. This GPA thing got me down at first.
In Malaysia, the education system is largely British-influenced, 
so there's a big emphasis on mid-term and final exams. In our 
elementary and secondary schools, neither homework nor 
monthly tests count towards our final Grade  it's all based on 
our performance in the final exam. So I had a painful time 
adjusting to the constant bombardment of assignments, 
projects, tests, quizzes, research papers, and critical essays 
from all directions and with such consistency. Back home I was 
so bad at pacing myself that I'd go all out for no-holds-barred 
studying every time an exam week was creeped into sight... 
but that was only twice a year.
Not to say there's no pressure there. It's funny, but in 
Malaysia there seems to be more academic pressure than in 
most universities here (well, with the exception of CMU, of 
course). Probably because over there there's this powerful, 
almost blood-thirsty desire to be top in class. In America, 
students seem to be motivated more by the desire for selfimprovement rather than for competition. Over there, exam 
results aren't as confidential as they are over here, so everyone 
knows where they stand in relation to all the prodigies in class 
(boy, how that kills one's self-confidence).
Anyway, for an American in Malaysia, there'll be a lot 
more differences than the school systems. Even though 
America may be even more of a melting pot than Malaysia, 
individual cultures don't get 'watered down' there like they do 
in the U.S.
There are Chinese lion dances, Malay weddings (you can't 
avoid these, they're everywhere), Hindu festivals, various 
traditional dances and so many more things to see and experi
ence, if you feel like you want a dose of culture. Remember to 
leave your cultural prejudices and misconceptions at home.
Malaysia can be an experience for those who understand it, 
a mystery to those who can't. But boring? Never. It must be 
one of the few countries in the world to celebrate Muslim 
holidays, Chinese New Year, the Moon Cake Festival, not to 
mention Hindu festivals and even sultans' birthdays, in 
addition to Christmas and the usual state holidays... every 
year.
Now what would you call that? Cultural chaos-lah.

When ECE junior Rich Baker first started his college career, 
being from another country didn't hinder him at all. As a 
matter of fact, it helped him in many ways.
"It was easy to meet people at freshman camp," says 
Baker, "because I was from Australia and had the really strong 
accent at the time. People noticed it right away and it was 
something to talk about."
Being from a country where English is spoken and the 
culture is almost identical to that of the U.S. made the transi
tion easy for Baker. "America and Australia are similar in 
many ways," says Baker. "Some people encounter problems 
because they're from far away countries. I had very few of the 
problems and lots of the advantages."
Baker was originally born in the United States, but moved 
to Australia when he was three years old. He lives in Rose Bay, 
which is about thirty minutes away from Sydney. Both of his 
parents are American, which explains his very light Australian 
accent.
"Because both of my parents are American, I managed to 
get an American accent, in a way," says Baker. "I seem to lose 
my Australian accent rather quickly when I come back here."
His reason to come to the states was very specific: educa
tion. "Education was the main thing," says Baker. "I'm study
ing electrical and computer engineering, and in that field the 
top U.S. universities have a lot better reputations that the 
Australian ones. I figured that I could get into one of the top 
[American] universities and I got into CMU."
Even though he also applied to Standford, MIT, Princeton, 
Brown, and the University of Florida, Baker felt that CMU was 
definitely his best choice. "I love it here, " says Baker. "From 
Australia all I could really go by were books and reputation 
and so on.
"Australians really look up to American universities," says 
Baker. "The Australian universities are really good, but Ameri
can universities, even if the education isn't any better, still have 
the reputation just because they're American."
However, even with the advantages of reputation and 
sometimes a better education, going abroad to America isn't all 
that popular in Australia. "For Australians, it's quite unusual," 
says Baker. Only one other friend of his from Australia came to 
the States for a college education.
X\
Even though America and Australia are very similar in 
many ways, a few things are bound to be different between the 
two countries, and Baker found them.
For instance, in Australia, tipping is very uncommon. "My 
roommate is from New York and when I go out with him, he 
starts at 20 percent and works down from there for each 
mistake," Baker says. "I start at 0 percent and if the service is 
real good, then I consider tipping."
The subject of American and Australian sporting events is 
a whole different ballpark. 'The sports we follow there are a lot 
different than the American ones," says Baker. "The big sports 
down there are cricket, rugby (Australian rules), golf, and 
tennis. You never see baseball and basketball in Australia."
As for trying out some of the American sports, Baker's luck 
hasn't been too kind. "I haven't really gotten into basketball," 
says Baker. "I only played it twice since I got here and one of 
the times I fractured my thumb doing it, so I haven't gone near 
it since."
But, of all the differences between the two countries, the 
difference in weather has been a major factor. Since the seasons 
in Australia are opposite of those in America, Baker is consis
tently getting bombarded by winter. "That got me the first 
year," says Baker, "because I ended up spending winter there, 
coming over here right at the end of summer and going 
through another winter, and another winter, and so on. But last 
summer I stayed in Pittsburgh, although summer in Pittsburgh 
isn't much better than winter in Sydney."
Even with all of his gripes about the weather, Baker really 
enjoys America. "Although I complain about Pittsburgh a lot," 
says Baker, "and I don't like the cold, it's not as bad as I 
thought it might be."
As for living in America after graduating, Baker says, "I 
could see myself living here, for a while at least. I liked Or
lando, Florida, it was real nice. And California was quite nice 
also. But of all the places I lived, I still think I prefer Sydney 
over any of them."
Even though Baker enjoys America and has made a lot of 
friends here, he still misses Australia. "Where I lived I was 
right across the street from [Sydney] harbor," says Baker, "and 
I could walk right across the street and rent a windsurfer, or a 
catamaran. I didn't have to think about it beforehand, I would 
just decide, 'Hey, I want to go sailing!' and I went sailing. And 
you could do it almost year round because the weather was 
just beautiful."
But even with the miserable weather, the lack of sailing, 
having to tip, and odd American sports, Baker really loves it 
here. "I couldn't have expected a better decision from a dis
tance so far away."

When people ask you where you're from, you might say 
"Newark" or you might say "Philly." You could rattle on about 
California, or you might espouse the virtues of Texas. How
ever, not too many students can look you straight in the eye 
and say, "Howdy, partner. I hail from Botswana!"
Ntona Ketsitlile, a GSIA student working toward her 
master's degree, can say it. But those who know him certainly 
can't imagine him saying, "Howdy, partner."
"Ntona Ketsitlile" is a name that's as hard to pronounce as 
it is to spell, but you'd be surprised at its meaning after experi
encing Kensitlile's humorous, mild demeanor. "Ntona means 
'boss,' " he says, "and Kensitlile refers to mood ... I am angry, I 
am detesting something."
Botswana is located on the African continent, sharing its 
southern border with South Africa. Its climate is semi-arid, 
meaning that there is little rain and the temperature remains 
high year-round. The country gets most of its water from 
dammed rivers and wells, but the region still lacks an adequate 
water supply. Botswana's chief export is diamonds.
Ketsitlile left his home city of Gaborone  "It's approach
ing 100,000 in population ... a small town by American stan
dards"  to get an education at Carnegie Mellon in business, 
supplementing the bachelor's degree he earned in Botswana. 
"Botswana only has one university, and it doesn't offer masters 
programs," he says.
Ketsitlile plans to return to Botswana after, he gets his 
masters degree and put it to use. "I'm just going to go back to 
my job and maybe look for other job opportunities," he says.
Ketsitlile admits that Botswana's population is still signifi
cantly uneducated, but notes that the situation is improving. 
"We have only been independent for thirty five years," says 
Ketsitlile. "But the educated people still have links with those 
out in the rural areas."
Besides education, Ketsitlile is concerned with white 
minority rule, but the problems that have plagued South Africa 
haven't had much effect in Botswana. "We don't keep percent
ages, but there are definitely more blacks than whites," says 
Ketsitlile. "But we are multiracial. We don't look at someone as 
being white or black. We just look at someone as being from 
Botswana or foreign. We have problems with whites being in 
charge, but it is definitely getting better."
Whites and blacks in Botswana work together for the pula, 
the country's monetary unit, which is equal to about fifty cents 
in American dollars. "The purchasing power of the pula in 
Botswana is about the same as the purchasing power of the 
dollar in America," says Ketsitlile. The pula is even slightly 
stronger than the South African Krugerrand.
"Pula," incidentally, means "rain." "We value rain so 
much that it is like money," says Ketsitlile.
Industrialized products aren't produced in great quantity 
in Botswana, but other countries sell their products there with 
few problems. "American products can be found in Botswana, 
but we import almost all our goods from South Africa," he 
says.
The economic ties between Botswana and South Africa are 
strong  so strong, in fact, that the sanctions levied by govern
ments of the world against South Africa, says Ketsitlile, "af
fected Botswana very much."
But even that link between their economies doesn't prevent 
South Africa from instigating violence in Botswana. "We have 
had problems with South Africa. South Africa has been trying 
to destabilize countries in the region, including Botswana.
They have come into Botswana and killed innocent citizens, 
claiming that the citizens were terrorists."
Because of the distance between America and Botswana, 
Ketsitlile hasn't gone home since he arrived, 18 months ago.
I've never gone home since I came here," he says. "It's too 
expensive."
In the meantime, Ketsitlile is spending time adjusting to
the culture shock that results from the weird ways of the West.
"There are a lot of differences between America and 
Botswana," says Ketsitlile. "You don't have very much social 
interaction. In Botswana, in a city of several hundred thousand, 
there are a lot of people that I know. It is our custom that when 
I pass someone on the street whom I don't know, I have to 
greet that person. Here, they are not as friendly. You get into a 
PAT bus and it's dead silence. It's harder to make friends 
here."
People from Botswana also show much greater respect for 
their elders than Americans. "In our country, if someone is 
older than you, you have to treat him like your father or your 
mother," Ketsitlile says. "For example, in class, we respect 
teachers. Normally teachers are older than students. But here, 
when the student talks to the teacher, he calls him by first 
name. Americans like using first names. We don't so much in 
our country. People refer to each other mostly by last name, 
unless they are the same age group, or they are younger than 
you, or you are close friends."
Even saying hi to "Mom" and "Dad" is different. "In our 
culture, the parents are addressed by their first child's name," 
says Ketsitlile. "To explain: Let's say our first born was Se-juon. 
My father would be Ra-juon, and my mother, Ma-juon."
Botswana is a democracy with free elections, says 
Ketsitlile. The government is similar to that of Great Britain  
the majority party of the parliament elects the prime minister
 and that makes sense: Botswana only achieved indepen
dence from the English in 1965, he says.
Ketsitlile isn't considering a career in politics, though. "The 
government back home doesn't pay as much as the private 
sector," he laughed.

AIESEC manages business majors in a world arena
AIESEC isn't just another bunch of letters that Carnegie 
Mellon created to confuse its students. AIESEC, the Interna
tional Association of Students in Economics and Business 
Management, is an independently-run, worldwide organiza
tion of students and non-students who arrange foreign ex
changes through the business community. AIESEC receives no 
funding from the university or the Student Senate; they are 
simply given a room in the bottom floor of Skibo.
AIESEC was founded in 1948, after the destruction and 
racial hatred of World War II. Young people in Europe wanted 
an organization to bridge the gaps between countries. They 
thought the best way to join nations would be through foreign 
exchanges. They organized these exchanges through interna
tional companies. As a result of their original ideas, AIESEC 
refuses to be politically influenced. Even in such cases as South 
Africa, when the American government sanctions the country, 
AIESEC continues its exchange program.
Today AIESEC of Pittsburgh, founded in 1976 by Glen 
Raiger, is one of sixty chapters in the U.S. to exchange students 
with such countries as Norway, Switzerland, Korea, Germany, 
and Poland. The chapter consists of thirty members and meets 
every Wednesday at 5:30. The meetings are open to anyone 
with an interest is business or international study. At each 
meeting, members analyze and discuss different aspects of 
business such as marketing, finance, and management.
However, AIESEC's main concern is the foreign exchange 
program. AIESEC members approach companies outside of 
their country and ask them to sponsor a student. The company 
then offers a student a position in their company. These jobs 
range in requirements, depending on the ability of the stu
dents. The foreign employee would receive a salary from $250
to $400 a week and is expected to budget his rent and house
hold expenses.
In order to become a foreign exchange student, members 
simply need to fill out an application. AIESEC reviews the 
student and matches him or her with an international com
pany. The company decides whether or not they want the 
student, and the student decides if he or she wants the job. If 
everything works out, the student can go abroad, provided he 
or she pays the airfare.
After the student has been approved, the AIESEC chapter 
in the foreign country takes over. They find the student hous
ing and make sure he or she adjusts to the different culture. 
AIESEC members also take the student out and check on the 
student's job performance every two weeks.
Don't get the idea that AIESEC is limited only to people 
who want to go abroad. Students who want to stay in Pitts
burgh could get involved with AIESEC educational confer
ences. There are international, national, regional, and local 
conferences offered. Members attend these conferences to learn 
from programs during the day and party with other AIESEC 
members at night. There is a small fee for the hotel stay and 
transportation, but it's a good deal for anyone interested in 
meeting new people.
If you're just interested in learning how a company runs, 
and you want to make some business contacts, join AIESEC. Hs 
close relationship to the business community could open doors 
for you when you are job-hunting.

"Rather than deciding that I wanted to study abroad, I 
ended up in the U.S. because I wanted to attend Carnegie 
Mellon University," says Makiko Toyoda, an exchange student 
from Tokyo's Keio University, when I asked her why she was 
studying abroad.
"I met a CMU delegate at an International Students 
Conference my sophomore year, and the way he explained 
CMU's IM program excited me," says Toyoda. 'The business 
curriculum sounded so different from my school's."
When she first got here, Toyoda could speak enough 
English to get by and have simple conversations. "I've had an 
American friend living in my house for over a year. I talked to 
her all the time, and that improved my English more than I 
imagined/' she says. "Also, when I first got here, one of my 
roommates was always around to talk to me and explain 
anything that I didn't understand." Even though her English 
was good, she had to ask people to repeat what they were 
saying because they spoke too fast. She understood most of 
what her professors said in class, but couldn't write fast 
enough in English and took all her notes in Japanese. After two 
months, Toyoda found that English had become much easier, 
and it all clicked into place. Now her notes are half in English, 
half in Japanese. Although she modestly claims that she still 
needs lots of practice, Toyoda can now talk about practically 
anything in English.
Some things about the U.S. were strange to her. Toyoda 
finds Americans very blunt. "It seems to me to have everything 
to do with language," she says. "Americans state things so 
simply, including negative things. In Japanese, we tend to be 
ambiguous sometimes. We don't clearly say no, or voice 
opposing opinions. The language has a lot of buffers, words 
that soften anything that might seem harsh or impolite."
Socializing is very different in Japan. Japanese college 
students always hang out in large groups. Toyoda is used to 
getting together with thirty or forty people after class and 
going drinking or out to dinner. Everyone heads home fairly 
early because most students commute and they have at least a 
40-minute train ride. Even on the weekends, everyone leaves to 
get on the train by ten. "The night is longer here," Toyoda says. 
"It seems that night is when everything gets done, when you 
get to see your friends."
In many ways, though, CMU reminds her of Keio. "The 
atmosphere is very similar. It's very university, very intellec
tual. Everyone studies at CMU."
She also finds that both universities share a very urban 
attitude. "Most of the people at Keio have lived in Tokyo all or 
most of their lives, and many of the people I've met here come 
from New York City."
Toyoda adjusted to CMU fast, and found it easy to meet 
people. She is in ASA, the Asian Students Association, and says 
that a lot of her friends are Asian, and she also spends a lot of 
her time at AIESEC. She volunteered to help solicit donations 
for AIESEC because of her experience in the Business and
Economics club at Keio. Besides her three roommates, whom 
she considers the best roommates she could have, she has lots 
of American friends from classes and AIESEC.
After almost a semester at CMU, Toyoda has changed in 
some ways. She had always wanted to work in a financial 
institution, ideally a huge Japanese bank. Now, she wants to be 
successful not just in the Japanese business world, but in a 
more international way, working in international finance, and 
maybe working abroad. She sees Japan a little differently, from 
an outsider's viewpoint.
"There's still lots of sexism in Japanese business," she says. 
"Things are changing, even in Japan. Companies ask prospec
tive employees if they intend to go to grad school, and they ask 
women interested in untraditional fields if they are 'willing to 
be pioneers.' But it's not mainstream for women to work in 
finance. And although I have no problem being polite and firm 
about what I want to do, the sexism is more obvious to me 
now.
"It was a big decision to come to CMU for a year. It wasn't 
too hard because I was very interested in studying business 
here. Most of my friends were a year older than me and had 
graduated, so they wouldn't have been at Keio anyway. Now 
I'm more worried about missing CMU. I think I'll be lonely 
next fall, when I can't see my friends from here anymore."

ESL clarifies English and
Ed. Note  Chuck Sabatos, an H&SS sophomore, has been one 
of the student tutors at the English as a Second Language (ESL) 
Center for a year.
One of the major problems facing most foreign students at 
CMU is mastering the language. For reasons ranging from 
basic grammar to idioms that can't be translated, English can 
be difficult to learn. However, there is a facility at CMU that 
students can turn to, if they don't know whether to say "turn 
to," "turn in," or. "turn on."
The ESL (English as a Second Language) Center provides 
free tutoring to all non-native speakers of English who are 
members of the CMU campus. The main office of the Center is 
located in Room 213 of Smith Hall, the little building tucked 
behind Hamburg Hall.
ESL students can sign up for individual 40-minute ap
pointments on a weekly schedule sheet. During the session, 
foreign students work with tutors (most of whom are CMU 
undergraduate students) using workbooks, tapes or free 
conversation. Emphasis is placed not only on learning proper 
stress in English pronunciation, but differences in cultural 
values as well. Tutors often learn as much as those they're 
assisting, or at least gain an appreciation for CMU's growing 
reputation as an international university. In the year that I've 
tutored, I've primarily encountered graduate students and 
researchers from France, Italy, Spain, Lebanon, China, Japan 
and Korea.
Help with spoken English is not the only language assis
tance offered. The ESL offers a writing clinic that helps non
native speakers with everything from grammar and punctua
tion to writing abstracts and essays. According to Peggy 
ITeidish, director of the ESL Center, academic writing is more 
than just a language change for some foreign students.
"In general, foreign undergraduates can speak English 
fairly fluently, but when they have to write a paper, they aren't 
familiar with the style," she says. "For example, many foreign 
students, undergraduate and graduate, aren't used to taking a 
stand in their writing, or arguing a point. They come from 
cultures where the proper writing style would be seen as 
indirect and flowery here."
The ESL Center also offers classes, workshops and group 
activities. They have had two workshops this semester. One of 
the workshops was about, believe it or not, football. The 
workshop began with an explanation of the rules of the game, 
then everyone watched some football and discussed the game.
The job interview workshop covers cultural skills that 
foreign students should have in order to compete with their 
American counterparts. "An interview involves more than just 
questions about your qualifications; a lot of it has to do with 
your personality," says ITeidish. Students coming from cul
tures where being modest is the norm have to adjust to this 
cultural difference before competing for a job here. "These 
students need to learn how to highlight their strengths and not 
be modest."
In the Speaking and Listening class, foreign students learn,
culture for non-natives
according to Heidish, "the kind of language skills they'll need 
in the classroom." These skills will improve their ability to 
follow lectures and present their ideas in class. For foreign 
students who are or will be TAs, the class will improve their 
ability to communicate with students in their classes.
The ESL also offers a TA Training Workshop, in which 
non-native speaking TAs work to improve their teaching skills 
by improving nuances like using examples in their explana
tions and stressing key words when they speak.
"Stress is linked to meaning in English," says Heidish. "It's 
difficult for native English speakers to understand sentences 
spoken in a monotone voice. Even someone with a heavy 
accent can be easy to understand if he or she uses the right 
stress patterns." The}' even practice using non-verbal commu
nication to convey ideas. Everyone in the workshop is video
taped teaching a class, and the tape is used to help the student 
spot his or her weaknesses. "Many foreign TAs are skilled 
teachers, they simply don't know the American style of teach
ing."
In addition, the ESL held a workshop at this year's orienta
tion on non-native speaking TAs and how to communicate 
with them more effectively. Communciation between non
native speaking TAs is even more of a problem when the 
students are freshmen, and are less likely to discuss the prob
lem with the TA. As a result, fundamental concepts being 
taught in the class are unclear, and everyone becomes con
fused. "I think it's an important part of the mission of the ESL 
to reduce misunderstandings between foreign TAs and their 
students," says Heidish. "There are more and more non-native 
speaking professors and TAs all over the country."
Next September, non-native speaking faculty and TAs will 
be required by Pennsylvania state law to take a test of their 
language aptitude in order to teach. The manner in which the 
ESL Center operates probably won't change much, but the 
certification, according to Heidish, "will be a state law, and not 
just internal policy."
The ESL is currently part of a joint effort with modern 
languages to start a conversation program American students 
who are studying a foreign language are paired with a foreign 
student who speaks that language. The modern languages 
department, who suggested the idea, is working with the ESL 
to get the program off the ground. The pairs that have been 
formed so far converse in Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese, 
German and Russian. They'll meet independently about once a 
week, spending half of their time speaking in a foreign lan
guage, the other half speaking English. "We started late in the 
semester, but we'd like to continue," says Heidish. "People 
paired together could go to plays and musuems, and talk about 
cross-cultural differences."
For more information about any of the programs 
offered by the ESL or the conversation program detailed above,

Study abroad offers a world of opportunities
In the past, options for study abroad have been scarce at 
Carnegie Mellon. Senior professional writing major Thea 
Brandfon says when she wanted to go abroad a few years ago, 
"CMU offered very little in the way of help and in the way of 
programs, and their information about outside programs was 
basically a box of books."
But things here are changing rapidly, according to 
Brandfon. "The climate has definitely improved," she says 
"First of all, there is a real place on-campus for you to look for 
real options." She also mentioned that the people now working 
in the International Education office can offer the help and 
advice that she wanted when she was trying to decide on 
where to go.
Another boost to study abroad at CMU came from Presi
dent Mehrabian's creation of the University Committee on 
Study Abroad. Barbara Freed, chair of this committee, says 
"The purpose of this committee is to, (1) promote international 
education, (2) establish new programs and study abroad 
opportunities for every department in every college, and (3) to 
help revise and modify and adjust the policies so that students 
can go abroad without penalty."
The committee has representatives from every department 
and every department in every school has appointed study 
abroad coordinators. Their goal isto have 10 percent of CMU 
students going abroad by the '90s, according to Freed. Among 
the faculty there seems to be an appreciation of the value of 
going abroad.
"It's so easy to get caught up in academics, but there is 
something to be gained outside of book knowledge," says 
Brandfon. She participated in Denmark International Study 
Program (D.I.S.) for a semester. This particular program is run 
by Danes and is not affiliated with any particular university, 
except for using some of the facilities and professors of the 
University of Copenhagen.
Brandfon stayed with a Danish family for a semester and 
took classes taught in English. She was thrilled by the whole 
experience of going abroad, and even though she didn't 
associate much with Danish students, she learned a lot about 
Denmark from the weekend tours around the country. She also 
learned a lot from the one week study tour of Russia the 
program included.
"You're not going to find a better academic education than 
an American university, with some exceptions," says Brandfon, 
"but the reason you go abroad  and I know this sounds 
corny, but it's true  the reason you go abroad is to expand 
your horizons and deal with situations you wouldn't normally 
face. It's little things that have to do with a person growing in a 
different way."
A student interested in going abroad basically has three 
different options. The first one is a CMU administered pro
gram. According to Victor L. Thacker, director of International 
Education, Carnegie Mellon offers seven special programs.
 The newest of the programs, located in Tours, France, 
currently supports students in H&SS and CFA. However,
Freed emphasizes the fact that plans are being made to expand 
it to all CMU students. This will be the first university-wide 
program that will be open to all departments as well as stu
dents from other schools. Applications for this program will be 
available in December, and will be due in mid-Febuary or early 
March.
 Another program is in Switzerland, the Ecole
Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne. It is designed for sopho
mores in MCS and CIT and third-year Architecture students.
 A relatively new program created for students in H&SS 
and IM exists at Keio University in Japan.
 GSIA and the Art department both have special pro
grams in France, while Design has one in the Netherlands and 
one in Switzerland.
Another option is a CMU co-sponsored program. The 
quality of the courses in such a program would be okayed by 
different departments and the credits for any of the classes in 
the program would automatically transfer. Currently, CMU 
does not have such a program.
And finally, students can participate in an unaffiliated 
program, either by applying directly to a foreign university or 
participating in a program like D.I.S. When students have 
chosen what courses they wish to take while abroad, they have 
to consult their academic advisor about which credits will 
transfer. However, credit from special programs administered 
by CMU automatically transfers. "It's easy to think 'I'll never 
get credit if I study abroad'," says Brandfon, but most depart
ments make an effort to accommodate you because most 
faculty members think study abroad is a valuable experience.
Getting involved in study abroad at Carnegie Mellon is 
quite simple. In fact, according to Victor L. Thacker, director of 
International Education, it's a four step process. To begin, 
students must visit International Education to find a program 
which they like. They must then check with their academic 
advisors to confirm that their credits taken abroad will transfer. 
A visit to Financial Aid is next, where information on aid for 
the study can be found. The final step is to actually apply to the 
program.
When visiting the International Education office, located in 
Smith Hall, students are offered a database of over 3000 
programs. The programs can be accessed by simply entering a 
major, the area of the world the study is to be done in, and a 
few other facts such as the foreign language used by the 
program. After this information has been entered, the database 
spits back a list of programs, including some facts about them 
and an address to send for complete information if the Interna
tional Education office doesn't already have it.
All special programs run by CMU offer the same financial 
aid package that would regularly be offered. After a trip to the 
Financial Aid office to determine if financial aid is available, all 
that is left is to apply to the program.
"There are so many choices you have to make, you really 
need help in choosing unless you have something specific in 
mind," says Brandfon. She heard about D.I.S. from a friend at 
home who was participating in it, and then actually went to 
University of Pittsburgh's study abroad office and talked to a 
D.I.S. representative.
Most study abroad programs require that the student be a 
junior, though some sophomores and seniors are accepted, and 
being in good academic standing. It is also helpful, but not 
necessary, to know the language spoken in the program 
country.

Carnegie Mellon has a long way to go to attain a truly international student body. In fact, in the fall semester of 1989
 the latest for which figures are available  87% of the 7,090 students here claimed American citizenship, with 
most of the foreigners being graduate students. Only 3% of the undergraduate student body had citizenship outside

Many people believe that moving to the United States from 
the Soviet Union would be a big change, with many problems 
to overcome. According to Audris Mackus, a first year gradu
ate student from Lithuania, this belief is not true. Mackus, who 
is 26, has been in the U.S. for three months now, taking gradu
ate courses in the Statistics department.
Mackus began his college career by entering the Physical 
Technical Institute in Moscow when he was 18 years old. He 
chose the institute because of its prestige and its emphasis on 
research. Most colleges in the Soviet Union are a lot like 
American schools; they have a structured curriculum and 
classes are taught in the same way. Audris' school, however, 
was different than the typical college American students and 
Soviet students are used to, as it emphasised research. For the 
last three of his four years of college, he was mostly on his 
own, working on theses and other projects. In this way, he 
structured his own learning, concentrating on topics that 
interested him.
Mackus says he came to the U.S. mainly "to see what 
things looked like from another point of view." Professor 
Kadane from the Statistics Department at CMU, however, was 
ultimately responsible for Mackus coming to this school to 
study. The professor was attending a conference in Europe and 
talked to Mackus about the Soviet Union's new exchange 
program that was slated to begin in 1989. "It was hard to 
apply," says Mackus. "It was the first GRE given in the Soviet 
Union." Also, getting the information for applying was diffi
cult because of the inefficient mail system in the U.S.S.R. and 
because information on U.S. colleges is not easily available.
Even before he could begin the application process to come 
to CMU, Mackus had to pass many Soviet qualifications. He 
had to be a member of the Communist Party, and he had to 
have a good school status. For the first GRE, only eighty 
students from the U.S.S.R. took the test and participated in the 
exchange program.
When Mackus first came over to the United States, he says 
he didn't have much problem adapting to the way of life here. 
Most of his problems were little ones that people take for 
granted, such as using banks. "It took about a week to get used 
to things," he says. "Otherwise, it wasn't hard."
The only major change that Mackus found was in the way 
his classes are conducted. In college, he was on his own most of 
the time, doing his own research. Now that he is here, how
ever, he has to get back into the groove of classes, homework, 
and tests. "I liked doing what I wanted," he says. "The classes 
here are much more structured."
In his old college, Mackus was able to learn just as much as
he is learning in the structured courses. But learning used to be 
up to him. "About half the students would try hard and the 
other half wouldn't try as hard," he says.
In the social scene, Mackus has not found anything here 
different from the things to which he is accustomed. Usually, 
exchange students can find people from their home country to 
relate to and hang out with. Although Mackus is the only 
student from Lithuania at CMU, he has met students from East 
Europe and Asia but does not restrict himself. He is very 
interested in learning things from new perspectives and 
therefore finds people from different places interesting.
Mackus also noted that the political differences was not a 
big change. Since 1985, there was a growing movement for 
more personal rights, and the fall of the Eastern Bloc simply 
mirrored this. And even before this, not much information was 
supressed. The average life, he noted, is much the same for 
Soviets as Americans. The only major difference between the 
two countries is that the American economy is stronger at this 
point.
Mackus is not sure what he is going to do later in life. He 
wants to continue at CMU and get a PhD. After that, he is not 
sure.
"I cannot plan that far ahead," he explains. "It depends on 
many different things."

Mechanical Engineering graduate student Helgi 
Hjalmarsson doesn't think he'll stay in the United States after 
his visa runs out.
In fact, Hjalmarsson probably won't stay here long after he 
graduates.
You can't blame him. To hear Hjalmarsson, a native of 
Iceland, talk about his homeland, Iceland is a veritable para
dise.
Iceland only has a population of about 250,000, maintains a 
high standard of living, and has low unemployment and crime 
rates.
His hometown of Kopavogur has a population of only
15,000  "you would hardly notice it," says Hjalmarsson  
and to say that moving to Pittsburgh has been a change would 
be an understatement. The weather, although never any colder 
than about 10F and never any hotter than around 70T in the 
summer, can be very dynamic in a very short period of time. 
These changes can wreek havoc with the fishing, Iceland's 
major source source of income. "About fifteen people die every 
year because the weather changes while they're out fishing, 
and they don't have the time to make it back to shore," says 
Hjalmarsson. "A storm can come in a matter of hours."
Conversely, the length of the day in Iceland is as erratic as 
the weather is here. Right now, the sun rises at about 11 am 
and set at around 4 pm. During the winter Skammdegi season, 
the days can be as short as 3-4 hours long and may not come at 
all in some areas, and the coming of the sun means sun pan
cakes. During the summer, there is a season similiar to the 
Russian white nights when "the days last much longer, and the 
children are allowed to play longer." There's even a golf 
tournment there where games can be held all day and all night.
The atmosphere in Pittsburgh compared to Iceland's seems 
as different as day and night. Hjalmarsson describes the 
difference in the crime rates in Iceland and the United States as 
"the biggest difference you feel when you come." He brought
his wife Helga Waage and his one-year old daughter Hrefna 
with him, and he is mainly concerned about his daughter's 
safety. When he and his family first arrived here, they had to 
stay in a dorm room while they looked for a place to live. "It 
was me, my wife, and a baby, all in this little room overlook
ing Forbes Avenue," he laughs. "There was a lot of noise."
Initial difficulties aside, however, Hjalmarsson is at ease 
with the change. One of the biggest reasons he is so welladjusted after only three months of living here is that he has 
been preparing for this point in his life for so long. The 
University of Iceland, the only university on the island, has 
no graduate program. "Since there are no graduate studies in 
Iceland, you have to go abroad," says Hjalmarsson.
In Iceland, it's customary for students to travel abroad to 
visit companies and consider colleges. Hjalmarsson had 
already been to the United States twice  once in 1987 to 
California and Hawaii and again in 1989 to Florida - when 
he came three months ago to CMU to study mechanical 
engineering. Out of his graduating class of thirty students, 
six came to the United States to continue their studies. 
According to Hjalmarsson, a roughly equal number of 
Iceland's graduate students choose to study in the United 
States and Denmark, about 30 percent, but "the United 
States is catching up," he says.
In addition to being accustomed to the idea of travelling 
abroad, Hjalmarsson speaks English fluently. In Iceland's 
educational system, everyone studies English in Grunnskoli 
(which is, in principle, equivalent to primary and junior high 
school in the United States) between the ages of twelve and 
sixteen. Hjalmarsson studied English for another three years 
in Menntaskoli (the secondary and final school), and took in 
lots of American and British movies and music.
Despite a constant stream of information from other 
countries, Iceland remains relatively isolated from the rest of 
the world. According to Hjalmarsson, the language has 
remained so uninfluenced by foreign cultures throughout the 
centuries that anyone who speaks modern Icelandic "can 
read old scripts straight."
Since its independence from Danish control in 1944, 
Iceland rarely appears on the world news front. It is politi
cally unique, however, in that it currently has its first female 
president, Vigidis Finnbogadottir, and its all-female political 
party, the Kvenna listinn, now holds 10 percent of the parlia
ment. Hjalmarsson gets two newspapers from home to keep 
him up to date, and estimates his phone bills to average 
about $200 each month. Although it only takes a week to 
send a letter here from Iceland, the mail often takes longer to 
get arrive there from here. "Once my mail went to Ireland 
first because of the one-letter difference," Hjalmarsson 
laughs.
Hjalmarsson hasn't seen much of the States, though, and 
he plans to do more travelling. "I've been to Fallingwater 
once," he says, "but mostly, I'm too busy." Aside from his 
academic work and the projects he is involved with through 
the EDRC, it's difficult to find a babysitter, especially since 
he's just gotten here. If they stay during the summer, he and 
his family will have time to see more of the country. "I'd like 
to go to the Rocky Mountains," says Hjalmarsson. "They 
look very beautiful."
Hjalmarsson plans to finish his master's degree in two 
years and he and his family will return to Iceland. "When I 
go back to Iceland, I'll probably be overqualified for what I 
want to do  there's not much high-tech there," he says. 
And while he finds CMU challenging, the change in pace 
from here to home probably won't phase him.

"There are so many different peoples, religions, and 
cultures mixed together in America," says Rudi Stouffs, a 
graduate student in architecture from the Belgian village of 
Overijse, near Brussels. "On one hand, you have this huge 
melting pot, but if you look a little closer you'll see a lot of 
separation within. It's difficult to see what lies at the heart of 
American society  the melting pot or the separation."
Stouffs came to Pittsburgh nearly three semesters ago as a 
graduate student to study Computer Aided Design and get a 
masters degree in architecture. "In Europe, there's a negative 
impression of U.S. undergraduate studies," he says. "European 
countries offer a much broader base, but for graduate studies 
the U.S.'s specialization is an advantage."
Stouffs preferred studying abroad to going to a Belgian 
school. "There's not really much difference between the major 
Belgian universities," he says. Of the six Belgian universities, 
the three in the north were Flemish speaking and the three in 
the south were French speaking.
People generally choose their university based on its 
political orientation; they're all fairly equal educationally. "I 
don't choose a school for its orientation, I choose it for the 
studies."
Since coming to Pittsburgh, Stouffs has lived in both South 
Oakland and Squirrel Hill. "Looking back at my time in South 
Oakland, it was terrible. But I spent almost all of my time on 
campus, so it didn't bother me. I like Squirrel Hill. It's calm 
and quiet. And the bike ride through the park to campus is 
very nice."
But his home in Belgium is simply "paradise." "There's 
about 20 thousand people, not really a town at all, with lots of 
history near a large forest," says Stouffs. "I really like it."
One of the best things about Belgium life is the closeness of 
the people. "In the villages of Belgium, everybody knows 
everybody," says Stouffs. "The whole village is like one big 
family, and you really aren't accepted unless you're born there. 
Moving outside of your village is almost unheard of, and there 
are very few foreigners outside of the cities." He says that, 
outside the cities, people with different racial and cultural 
backgrounds are very difficult to find. "People outside the
cities seem to have a very negative attitude towards anything 
that would change their day-to-day lives."
Some of the smaller differences between the two countries 
are also apparent. "Belgium has all sorts of little shops," says 
Stouffs. "Every corner and every neighborhood has a little 
general store, bakery, or deli. Downtown Pittsburgh seems 
kind of empty in comparison. We don't have any big shopping 
malls. Here, people can go to the malls and get anything they 
want. Why would they want to go anywhere else?"
Stouffs relates a story about a busload of American tourists 
that stopped in Brussels. "They got out of the bus, cowboy hats 
and all, and made straight for the McDonald's. They had 
'Americans' written all over them."
But Belgium shows little of the animosity towards America 
that's often reported in the U.S. media  the Belgian opinion 
of the United States is mixed. "We're not in favor of American 
politics, but we really don't have anything against American 
individuals," says Stouffs. "We really don't know that much 
about the people. The only way you can find out is to go there 
and experience it.
"They say that the U.S. is a free country. In the broader 
sense it is, but they are much more strict about many specifics," 
he says, citing censorship of TV shows and strict movie rating 
guidelines. "You have to decide for yourself what you or your 
kids will see. The government doesn't decide for you.
"It's amazing how strict they are about beer here," he 
added. "It wouldn't be possible to imagine the U.S.'s laws in 
Belgium  the pubs are really the center of social activity. And 
we really couldn't imagine a speed limit of only 55."
Overall, Stouffs has enjoyed America, including his trips to 
Connecticut and Washington, D.C. But he still enjoys returning 
home. "I like it here, but it gets frantic at times. It's good to go 
home."

New department will diversify language study
CMU has a new department this year, Modern Languages. 
What?!? Hasn't Carnegie Mellon always had a foreign lan
guage departriient? But its true. About 10 years ago, Carnegie 
Mellon abolished its language department and Modern Lan
guages at CMU turned into a program under the history 
department. Now all that is changing.
"CMU maintained language instruction," says Barbara 
Freed, director of the new Modern Languages department,
"but there was no research identity or focus of the depart
ment." She says there was no real cohesive aspect to what was 
going on.
Since she's been here, Freed has spent a lot of time "jump
ing into everything at once." She has spent a few weeks 
looking at the graduate program; she has looked at possibly 
introducing a proficiency test to place students in the correct 
level of language course; she has spent some time with study 
abroad; and she has looked at what kinds of research direction 
the language department should take.
Freed has also spent some time looking at whether or not 
foreign language is a rigorous enough major. She is looking at 
the possibility of including requirements to different disci
plines for the language major. By the fall of 1991, she hopes 
there will be enough added classes and outside disciplinary 
requirements added to allow an independent language major, 
something which CMU doesn't have.
The language department is not only there to offer courses 
in the grammar of foreign languages. "Teaching language and 
learning language is not limited to the acquisition of grammar. 
The diversity of courses that we will offer in the future is going 
to expand," says Freed. "For example, I foresee a time when we 
will have the best and most innovative translation program in 
the United States."
"We hope very much to be able to unite with other disci
plines and other departments," Freed says. She thinks that the 
study of language is applicable to many different disciplines. 
She cited cognitive sciences, machine translation, and artificial 
intelligence as fields that relate very much to modern lan
guages. She doesn't think the study of language should be 
fragmented across different departments.
"Throughout the country, most departments of language 
focus on literary criticism, there are a few programs that focus 
on language teaching, but there is no program that will do 
what we're going to do," Freed says, referring to her idea of 
working with different disciplines and particularly high 
technology extensively. "And, of course, we want to provide 
students the most innovative way to learn languages as 
possible."
Freed talks about expanding the program a lot, but Mod
ern Languages has run across budgetary constraints. She says 
two things will be necessary to do the things that she has in 
mind. First of all, Freed hopes to bring in some revenue from 
faculty grant proposals, "but the other part is going to have to 
be something that comes form the administration. It has to be a 
partnership."
Freed wants to take Modern Languages into a whole new 
arena. She doesn't want to copy other departments at other 
schools, she wants to take the department in a new and innova
tive direction. She wants to make the buzzword at Modern 
Languages "interdisciplinary."

Eight years ago, Susan (whose 
name has been changed at her re
quest) was told she would die within 
a year.
Today, she is devoted to educat
ing people about the illness which 
was to have been her death: Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
When I was diagnosed, I was 
made to feel that my life was over, 
Susan said in a talk she gave at the 
CMU Womens Center in conjunc
tion with last Saturdays World 
AIDS Day. Susan has been living 
with her illness  and the subse
quent fear  without major reper
cussions. HIV can lead to AIDS 
Related Complex (ARC), and then 
full-blown Acquired Immune Defi
ciency Syndrome.
At the time of her diagnosis, little 
was known about the virus and its 
treatment. I turned to the gay 
community, because nobody else 
really knew anything about it, even 
the health care workers I talked to 
about it, she said. Nobody knew 
anything then. But I got myself 
educated. I went to anything that 
had to do with [AIDS]: lectures, 
seminars. I attempted to do some 
volunteer work, but you can only 
do so much. I had to balance my
self...
I guess the major turning point 
for me in accepting and dealing 
with [HIV] was getting myself 
educated, she said. I think it gave 
me strength, understanding, the 
power to make decisions for my
self.
Susan will never be certain of 
how she contracted HIV. It could 
have been sex, it could have been 
drugs, she said. I was an active 
addict at the time. I was trying to 
get clean. But getting [HIV] didnt 
make me get clean.
I was really trying to get my life 
together.... I kind of put the infec
tion in the back of my mind until I
was off the drugs. It probably saved 
my life, she said.
Because Susan was diagnosed so 
early in the outbreak of AIDS, she 
was also victim to medical falla-r 
cies. After I was diagnosed, I was 
in the hospital with pneumonia. 
They told me that if I had AIDS, I 
would have been dead, so I didnt 
worry about it. I dismissed it.
Yet, after she dealt with her ad
diction, she was able to start coping 
with the reality of her illness.
Confronting her fears was a large 
part of this process. I had a lot of 
fears I had to conquer, she said. 
One was coming to terms with 
what I thought about God and 
death.... I really wish I could believe 
in some kind of afterlife, but I 
dont.... I just think when youre 
dead, youre dead.
Her infection has made her deal 
with problems and ideas which she 
might not have considered before. 
With the threat of sickness and 
death hanging over her constantly, 
she has had to confront these things 
in order to keep her sanity.
I guess we all have to go through 
these confrontations eventually, but 
[HIV] really forced me to confront 
them, said Susan. It made me 
come to terms with things I really 
didnt want to face.
Susan did deny her illness for 
quite a while. When youre in the 
shower and feeling good, its really 
hard to believe that theres a disease 
running through your body. You 
dont want to believe it.... You have

"The population loss does not mean the city is less at
tractive, but the economy of the 21st century will be 
more diversified." Mike Aquiviva, 
Pittsburgh Labor and Industry Department _______________________________deputy press officer
By DAN HOLLAND
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Counting people can be an 
arduous task, especially with an 
estimated 250 million people in 
the United States. Accuracy is 
the hardest but most important 
part of the census-taking 
process because the results will 
have a tremendous impact on 
the political, social, and eco
nomic future of states and cities 
including Pittsburgh.
The preliminary numbers for 
the.' city and county populations 
were announced in late August, 
and showed that Pittsburgh 
reported a loss of 14.1 percent of 
its population, or nearly
100,000 people, since 1980. The 
steel producing areas were hit 
hardest: McKeesport lost 16.8 
percent of its population; 
Homestead,18.7 percent; 
Braddock,19.0 percent; and 
Olairton, the worst loss, 21.42 
pjercent of its population in the 
tn-year span.
The census results are crucial 
to Pittsburgh and other cities 
that lost population because the 
data will determine the amount 
of federal and state funding 
they will receive, how city and 
business programs will proceed, 
and the reapportionment of 
congressional districts.
The census provides a 
snapshot of where the country 
is now, what the future holds, 
and where it has been, said 
USA Today demographics
reporter William Dunn. The 
census is vital for planning and 
it provides information for the 
design of public and private 
programs, and will affect social 
problems and progress.
The official state totals are 
due on December 31, while city 
and county official totals will be 
announced on April 1,1991. 
These results will have immedi
ate political consequences in the 
reapportionment process. 
Redrawing congressional 
districts is controlled by state 
legislatures who may draw the 
district lines to their political 
advantage.
It is like musical chairs, said 
Dunn. He feels that this process 
must be fair and mindful of the 
needs and rights of minorities, 
a group often misrepresented. 
Pennsylvanias odd-shaped 
congressional districts reflect 
the political haggling for party 
control of a region. Politicians 
can draw cockeyed boundaries 
favoring their special interests, 
diluting power of the opposing 
party, Dunn said.
The preliminary census
numbers indicate that the 
typically Republican South and 
West stand to gain political 
power at the expense of the 
more commonly Democratic 
Northeastern portion of Penn
sylvania. In 1992, Pennsylvania 
is expected to lose one congres
sional district, most likely the 
18th districtof suburban Pitts
burgh, recently won by Rick 
Santorum over incumbent Doug 
Walgren. In addition, New York 
and Michigan are expected to 
lose two seats. By contrast, 
California, Florida, and Texas 
will gain several congressional 
districts.
This trend of population loss 
from the Northeast is not new. 
Pittsburghs population has 
slowly been declining during the 
last 30 years. The city reached 
its peak in 1960 with 676,806 
and has dwindled to an unoffi
cial 364,379 people in 1990.
We anticipate this figure to 
be higher when the results 
become official, said Mary Hall, 
City Plannings trouble-shooter 
on the census. Hall also feels 
that this number represents the
low point for population loss. 
We knew we had been losing 
population over the decade, but 
the loss was not as great as 
some predicted. Ultimately, we 
would like to reduce the rate of 
loss to zero, then turn the 
corner, she said.
Other city officials were more 
skeptical about the decreasing 
population. The City of Pitts
burgh challenged the Census 
departments results, as did 
6,600 other cities. John 
Connolly of the Census Bureau 
said, The mayor was critical of 
the results.
But the citys challenge of 200 
missing city blocks, or 5,202 
housing units, was small 
compared to New Yorks chal
lenge to 11,957 missing blocks 
or Philadelphias unaccountable 
3,194 blocks. However, the 
Pittsburgh results had major 
glitches, such as the omission of 
the Trimont tower residents on 
Mt. Washington.
It really seems that some
body blew it, said H&SS Dean 
Stephen Fienberg, an expert on 
statistical analysis of census
data. However, Fienberg said,
[I trust] the professionals who 
are doing as hard a job as there 
is in this country.
The general public, however, 
was not so cooperative with the 
Census Bureau. Some ignored 
the forms, while others hid or 
lied to enumerators. Others 
became violent toward govern
ment workers. In New York 
City, an angry resident shot an 
enumerator while he was trying 
to enter a building. Another 
census worker was bitten on a 
front porch in Alton, Illinois by 
a woman who thought she was 
a fund-raiser.
Happily, said Hall, there was 
no violence toward enumerators 
in Pittsburgh, [largely due to] 
indigenous hiring, or hiring 
people from their own commu
nity, preventing much of the 
violence.
Another big problem with 
counting people is that some 
people are difficult to find. The 
toughest group to account for 
tend to be inner-city minorities 
and the homeless. The lower on 
the socio-economic scale you go, 
the more problems you have 
with government cooperation, 
says Fienberg.
Historically, minorities have 
often been misrepresented. 
Black men are the most 
undercounted in the country, 
said Hall. This is proven time 
and again over several cen
suses.
This periodic undercount, she
claimed, is largely because of 
their attitude toward the 
government. There is a lack of 
trust in the government, she 
said. Low income people are 
unhappy with government 
programs and they fear losing 
aid or grants. There is a feeling 
of hopelessness.
The census results will also 
determine Pittsburghs future 
in business growth, particularly 
in the suburban region. The 
preliminary figures indicate a 
population rise in outlying 
areas: Franklin Park had a 
60.9 percent increase in popula
tion since 1980, and Marshall 
Township reported a 52.2 ;
percent increase.
These results suggest a bright! 
future for the city. Pittsburgh  I 
will have more of a 
regionalization of the economy 1 
rather than a city-based one, J ; 
said Mike Aquiviva, the deputy | 
press officer for the states 
Labor and Industry Depart. ; 
ment. There is a ring [of j
businesses] growing around th ! 
city. The population loss does : ! 
not mean the city is less attract j 
tive, but the economy of the 
21st century will be more 
diversified.
It is safe to speculate from the J 
preliminary census results that ! 
Pittsburgh will witness a vital ! J

base, job market, and political ! !

Tartan Asst. Features EditorMaking that first call to CareBreak
Having a disabled child can 
be physically, mentally, and 
emotionally draining for par
ents and siblings alike. Often, 
the effects of such strain can 
have devastating ramifications 
including family disintegration 
and divorce. CareBreak pro
vides an extremely necessary 
sfgcvice, considering that no 
other agency across the country 
does anything quite like it. 
CareBreak is a non-profit 
organization that provides 
respite care for physically 
l)T>dicapped children under the 
{gg of 18 who are mentally 
LSrt. The purpose of respite 
care is for a volunteer to provide 
family with a physically 
(SBabled child with a break from 
oaring for the child. Many of the 
disabled children have debilitat
ing diseases such as Spina 
Bifida, Muscular Dystrophy, 
and Cerebral Palsy which often 
render them speechless or 
incapable of any type of physical 
movement whatsoever.
But these children are isot 
diagnosed as mentally retarded; 
in fact, some of them are brilll&it.
 '.I have gotten so much out of 
my time shared with Lynda, my 
little friend with Spina Bifida. 
Never having been exposed to a 
handicapped child before, ...I 
was apprehensive, Lorraine 
Mutschler wrote in a letter 
about her CareBreak volunteer 
experience. I tried to learn all I 
could about her special needs 
and problems. Nothing could 
have prepared me for our first 
meeting. Lynda cried when she 
learned I was to start coming to 
see her until we reassured her 
that I was not a nurse  just a 
friend there to spend time with 
her and have fun together. I 
stayed for two hours that day 
and when I left she asked me 
How soon I could come back. 
Then I cried.... Making that 
first call to CareBreak was the 
best thing Ive done.
' ^Mutschler wrote this letter to 
Igt; people know that there are 
S11 some things that can bring 
aTot of happiness into a life.
Carol Hertz, executive direc
tor and co-founder of 
t\ t
was the best thing I've done.
 Lorraine Mutschler, 
CareBreak volunteer
CareBreak, began the organiza
tion in January 1986 with 
limited funds and uncertainty 
as to whether the idea would 
work.
Five years later, CareBreak is 
a resounding success, training 
over 165 volunteers and servic
ing 80 families this year.
Program director Debbie 
Smith said, We are always 
looking for new volunteers. 
There is always a need.
Both Smith and Hertz agree 
that college students, such as 
those at Carnegie Mellon, are 
ideal candidates for volunteers, 
especially since some of the 
older physically disabled 
children desire college-age 
companionship.
Smith said, CareBreak is not 
a baby-sitting service. Were 
pretty flexible about what we 
do...sometimes a volunteer will 
just sit down and talk with a 
parent who needs it and some
times they will take the child 
out somewhere  whatever is 
necessary.
According to Hertz, Volun
teers are the lifeblood of the 
organization. Anyone over 18 
can be a volunteer. Each volun
teer is screened by the staff at 
CareBreak and then matched 
with the family of a physically 
disabled child.
Both the volunteers and 
families are evaluated each 
month to ensure that the child 
and parents are compatible 
with the volunteer. For the sake 
of convenience, volunteers and 
families in the same general 
vicinity are usually matched, 
because respite care takes place 
in the home of the family.
Volunteers undergo a brief 
training and orientation before 
they begin their work with 
physically disabled children and 
their families. Often, volunteers 
receive additional training 
depending on the needs of the 
child; however, no medical 
background is necessary to
participate in the program.
Parents provide the final 
training for the volunteers 
because they are the most 
knowledgeable about the needs 
of their child.
CareBreak requests volun
teers to make a six month 
commitment to the organization 
and spend just 35 hours a 
week with their respective 
families. Hertz says, The whole 
purpose of care break is to 
provide the finest quality 
support we can.
Another program which 
CareBreak provides is called 
Special Friends. Special Friends 
allows physically disabled 
children the opportunity to 
spend time with other children 
under the age of fourteen. The 
children meet every Saturday 
and play games, take fijeld trips, 
or just hang out.
According to a CareBreak

college students. This is a big cave, said 
Cale, But its a fairly tame cave. This 
allows us to let people to go through who 
normally dont do this.
You can take a guided tour if the 
thought of independent exploration gives 
you the willies. They leave every twenty 
minutes from the Visitors Center and 
give a rundown of the local geology. But 
this is kind of like travelling to the 
Fountain of Youth to do your laundry. If 
youre going to make the trek all the way 
there, you might as well come out with 
some juicy trauma that you can share 
with your analyst.
Upon entering the caves, one is im
mediately struck with how alarmingly 
vertical they are. Devils Staircase, one 
of the first passages youll have to nego
tiate, descends over 35 feet, and as you 
lower yourself down the rocky crawlspace 
youll appreciate as never before just 
how ridiculous the idea of Santa Claus 
is. Theres a tad of irony to the matter, 
however, since the caves are situated on
a mountainside, and their murky depths 
are still far above the surface of the 
Earth.
Theseus used a roll of thread to navi
gate Minos dungeons, but nothing short 
of eight miles of steel cabling would be of 
much use to you here. Youll wander 
through ghostly corridors hundreds of 
feet beneath the Earth, ease yourself 
along thin parapets above yawning cra
ters, splash through sandy underground 
streams, and squeeze your gasping body 
through cracks that would daunt the 
Incredible Shrinking Woman.
The caves are humanized with en
dearing names like Liberty Tubes and 
Hall of the Mountain King. The walls are 
splashed with boastful graffiti, some 
dated from decades past. Despite these 
shadows of civilization, the underworld 
is simply not the place for the claustro
phobic or those incapable of rigorous 
physical exertion.
The owners couldnt agree more with 
this sentiment. It is mandatory for ex
plorers to be equipped with safety hel
mets and required to sign a waiver of 
liability. Furthermore, anyone under 18 
must have his or her parents sign a form 
of consent beforehand. These somber 
precautions aside, nobody has ever suf
fered a serious injury on one of the administration-approved expeditions.
If you do decide to venture to the cav
erns, bring reliable flashlights, $15 per 
capita for admission, and heavy clothes 
that you were going to tear to shreds 
anyway. You can get more information 
on any aspect of the caverns by calling 
the offices at 329-5968.
Caving is a commitment to covering 
yourself in grime and sweat. Youll be 
utterly exhausted when you emerge from' 
your journey, but will doubtless enjoyrar< 
residual sense of triumph and fulfillm ent  
as well. Laurel Caverns may not be as~ 
overtly hazardous as Minoss labyrintih: 
but are a source of genuine adventuTe 
nonetheless, and, Im sure, would evoked 
a respectful whistle even from Theseus.w

flo image in mythology causes more 
ests to swell and eyes to glaze over 
ith visions of adventure than that of 
>ung Theseus, navigating the maze of 
j] King Minos in pursuit of the 
[inotaur. Minotaurs being somewhat 
arCe these days, Man has had to 
wnplay the homicidal aspect of 
ieseus feat, but still finds venue for his 
^oratory urges in recreational caving. 
Laurel Caverns, located an hour and a 
^lf south of Pittsburgh, is essentially 
hat youd get if you inclined the Labyith of Minos at a 45 degree angle: over 
 o miles of Gaeas contorted limestone 
wels, all lying in wait for you.
If this strikes you as more enticing 
an suicidal, then pack your bags for 
niontown and phone your friends with 
rs, because Laurel Caverns is open 
ery weekend  all week during the 
jrjng __ and offers the rare chance to
volitionally plunge hundreds of feet into 
the Earth and emerge both exhilarated 
and with as many limbs as you brought 
in with you.
The main feature of an extensive 430- 
acre park and campground area located 
high in the Appalachian Mountains, 
Laurel Caverns isnt a cave, according to 
a brochure. Its a maze-cave, which 
translates to having a flashlight in one 
hand and a map in the other in an en
vironment that requires having both 
hands free at all times.
Similarly, youre not going spelunk
ing. Caving is high adventure, said 
Laurel Caverns owner David Cale, 
People who do this all the time call 
themselves cavers. Spelunker is almost 
a camp term. If someone says, -Im a 
spelunker, we know hes not really a 
caver.
People who do this all the time not 
only includes grizzled old mountaineers, 
as you might expect, but boy scouts, 
school groups, and of course, hordes of

Being constantly misnamed is one of 
the many unpleasant realities of my life. 
Dont touch that dial now; this isnt going 
to be a long bitch about some problem I 
alone have to struggle with. This is Who 
is Jaui, after all, and not Movie of the 
Week.
In any case, if I were to bitch about this 
I might catch flak from those who claim 
that the verb to bitch is unfair to women 
as it presents a negative activity as in
trinsically female. In truth, there is no 
male equivalent to the verb to bitch, 
with the possible exception of to 
bullshit, which has similar negative 
connotations as well as the added detri
ment of stench.
Perhaps these terms for excessive 
complaining and lying like a rug, are 
misidentified in having gender attached 
to-.them. And while it is devastating 
enough to have ones sex identified with 
an^unsavory activity (and I am in no way 
prepared to make a judgement about the 
ggfjder against which the spread is 
S.t#fiked most unfairly) much more dev
iating is having ones individual iden
tity, attached to a single quality which 
supposedly defines one as a whole.
For centuries, novelists have exploited 
this idea in creating characters with 
names like Bounderby, Filch and, of 
course, Pussy Galore. The trend toward 
naming characters after significant at
tributes of their being was later echoed 
i&,the work of cartoon makers who en
dowed their creations with surnames 
such as Bunny, Coyote, and Duck.
Characters in fiction never seem to be 
affected by the descriptive nature of their
WHO IS JAVI?
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
name. Novels and cartoons seldom ex
plore what real life would be like if one 
were forced to go through it bearing a 
name like Ma Joad or Tennessee Tux
edo. A more realistic version of The 
Grapes of Wrath would doubtlessly fea
ture a long section detailing the destruc
tive role that bearing the name of Ma 
must have played in that poor womans 
love life. And by the way, thats Mr Tuxedo 
to you, bud. Similarly, being a real per
son who has to pass through reality with 
a name or label which supposedly en
compasses the whole of ones being can 
be a traumatic experience.
A good, real-life example of being 
misnamed lies in being identified as a 
part of another persons life. Most of us 
have had to go through that embarrass
ing party/family reunion/public hanging 
in which, by the end of the evening we 
are solely referred to by a label such as 
Buffys boyfriend, or Biffs daughter, 
or even that Hispanic columnist. Worse 
yet, these labels often cling together into 
the most uncomfortable of conglomera
tions. Anybody who has ever had to go 
through a party bearing the name of 
Biffs daughter Buffys Hispanic colum
nist boyfriend knows exactly what I am
talking about.
The odd thing about having a foreign 
name is that this in itself is seen as a sign 
of open season for misnaming. In cor
recting people who insist on pronounc
ing the name Javi with an English J 
sound, rather than the H sound which 
Js receive in Spanish, I have often been 
told that this is America, and that I 
should do as Americans do. Apparently, 
many view the United States of America 
as America, a perception which surprises 
those of us who were raised in Central 
America, South America or even Mexico 
and Canada.
If pointing this out fails to convince 
whoever it is who is mispronouncing my 
name I merely replace the constituent 
parts of their name with their appropri
ate Spanish counterparts. Consequently, 
I am acquainted with quite a few Hohns, 
Hims, and even Hoans and Hessicas.
Besides, if I were to translate my name 
directly into English, it would quite liter
ally mean Xavier Cricket. And I dont 
do When You Wish Upon A Star. I have 
yet to find an appropriate translation of 
Marxuach from the original Catalan, 
although I have it from a not too repu
table source that the name can be very 
loosely translated into Help, theres a 
hog in my kitchen. Laugh if you will, but 
thank the star you wish upon that for
eigners dont judge you by the literal 
translation of your name.
Nevertheless, judging people by their 
name can be a tricky endeavor. This is 
even true of a persons Christian name, 
because using the term Christian name 
can be, in itself, a gross misjudgment of
many. Seeing as most people have as 
much choice over the name they grow 
into as they have over who their parents 
are going to be, taking someones name 
as a character reference might put one a 
generation behind. In judging a person 
by name, one might also be stuck divin
ing what mood the guy from Ellis Island 
was on that day; however, making that 
assertion about anybody constitutes la
beling them, perhaps erroneously, as im
migrants of a certain kind.
Ultimately, there is no alternative to 
being called a name. Obviously, some 
names are more flattering than others. 
Personally, I prefer Javier GrilloMarxuach to arrogant stuck-up bas
tard. As limiting as the language may 
be, the dream of a limitless space in 
which to define ourselves is an impos
sible one. Some argue that self-definition 
is completely impossible within the realm 
of any language. I am not one of them.
Personally, I harbor a vision of an ideal 
world in which all that there is is re
ferred to in a manner which truly reflects 
the essence of that person or thing. Call 
it an appeal to a desire for the clarifica
tion of complex moral issues in the form 
of language, but somehow, the thought 
of walking into the polls and being given 
the choice between two-faced, promisebreaking, anti-intellectual and twofaced, promise-breaking, anti-intellectual, appears to be a liberating one.
However, in more practical terms, this 
world-view would turn the simple state
ment I am taking my girlfriend to Bobs 
Big Boy restaurant before heading for 
home and watching Twin Peaks into the
ponderous I shall be assembling with 
significant other of the opposite gender 
with whom I mate frequently in the f00{ 
distribution center which Robert ha< 
named after an oversized prepubesceni 
male child before perambulating to 
place of dominance in order to view - 
television program named Two Larg( 
Genetically Identical Mountains
Even in the seeming clarity of thi< 
Utopian Realm, all that the languagj 
system can truly accomplish is the label; 
ing of everything and everyone in a man', 
ner as judgmental and biased as that o 
any other language. After all, no one can 
speak for the large prepubescent chile 
whom Robert has robbed of the faculty o; 
self-definition, a state of affairs which 
not too far from that in which Pussy 
Galore, Tennessee Tuxedo and ever 
Javier Grillo-Marxuach find themselves
In any name, then, there exists an 
unspoken judgement. If in using the lan 
guage there exists the danger of compli 
ance with a system which judges an 
individual, then there also exists the 
possibility of judging and changing tha 
language in the same terms in which i 
has been used against us. Barring th< 
invention of a portable deep-well-of-be 
ing-revelation-system, judgement is in 
evitable, as is the responsibility for th( 
quality of those judgements - somethin 
which may or may not be mislabeled 
judgement call. And thats Mister Tux 
edo to you, bud.

Drosophila Eye-Specific 
Proteins and Cloning the 
Genes that Encode Them, 
with professor John Pollock. 
His project deals with the 
cloning of genes that make 
proteins important to the 
development of a fruit flys 
eye. Burkman said informa
tion about proteins and 
cloning discovered by experi
menting with fruit flies could 
later be applied to humans. 
Burkman is using his grant 
money to buy materials such 
as filters, chemicals, and 
petri-dishes.
Sophomore Jennifer Phillips 
is conducting a project with 
the English department under 
the sponsorship of Kristina 
Straub called, Implications of 
the 18th Century Medical and 
Popular Discourse on the 
Socially Constructed Aspects 
of1 Melancholy. Phillips 
project will examine the ways 
in which medical and popular 
(^course may have contrib
uted to the actual construc
tion, or, at least, to the
solidification of existing forma
tive constructions, of feminin
ity in the eighteenth century.
Phillips said I took Catherine 
Griggers Introduction to 
Gender Studies as a freshman 
and since that time I have 
investigated feminism through 
various means, among them, by 
continuing to take related 
courses, like John Champagnes 
Film, Sex, and the Body at 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, and 
Kristina Straubs Discourse 
and Historical Change. Phillips 
has also been active inthe 
Womens Issues Collective and 
in the Womens Center on 
campus.
While these grants do open 
opportunits that would other
wise be unavailable, Jon Swartz 
said that students are required 
to take much initiative on their 
own and must have a welldefined project before receiving 
a grant. He feels however, that 
this program says a lot of good 
things about the universitys 
attitude towards research and 
towards undergraduate educa
tion.

Brent Lowe, a junior drama 
major, will play the important 
role of jester in making sure that 
the evening of Renaissance flows 
smoothly. The key to it all is the 
jester, said Witchner. He pre
pares the script. In addition to 
comic relief, Lowe controls the 
flow of the program as it goes 
from course to course.
As a jester, Im pretty much 
the master of ceremonies, said 
Lowe. I introduce all of th e 
guests. I welcome all our visitors, 
the courts, the lords, and all of the 
entertainers for the evening. 
The jesting wont come easy, 
though. Its, pretty much improvisational, said Lowe. I have to 
know how to react and how to 
respond with the audience on the 
spur of the moment. Ive got to be 
on my feet the whole time.
The choir will perform a concert 
at the end of the feast. Chadley 
Kelderman, a junior drama ma
jor, will mime. And a magician 
will also add to the array of min
strels and performers.

to be careful, though, because you 
could really hurt somebody with 
,that denial.
Probably the worst problem she 
has encountered has been the 
prejudice directed against her be
cause of having HIV. She was 
even fired from a housekeeping 
job because of her employers ig
norance and fear. The sad partis 
that these were corporate law
yers, educated people who should 
know better, said Susan. I just 
hate to see people so [casually] 
disregard it, as if its not their 
problem, she said. She still faces 
the ignorance of many that the
illness is a gay illness. Ive known 
... straight women whove died 
from it.
This year, the focus of World 
AIDS Day was on women, both as 
victims and as caretakers. In both 
roles, women have not been rec
ognized; one of the fastest grow
ing groups of AIDS victims is 
women. Susan said, I dont re
ally know that many women [with 
AIDS] in this area. I knew six. 
One of them is dead. Two of them 
are very sick.
There are more issues for 
women that havent been ad
dressed ...I think women should 
be considered at high risk [be
cause they are more susceptible]. 
A lot of women were experiencing 
fatigue, vaginal infections, and 
health care workers werent look
ing at these as symptoms of the 
virus. The difference between the 
gay community that was origi
nally affected, she said, and the 
population thats being affected 
now is that they were white, 
middle class men, they had good 
jobs, and good insurance. Its a lot 
different sitting in a clinic all day 
waiting for treatment than it is 
making an appointment with a 
private doctor.
Through her involvement with 
the other AIDS victims, Susan
has seen foreshadows of what her 
death might be. The sad thing is
 and dont get me wrong, Im 
going to live as long as I can in 
hopes there will be a cure  but I 
see a lot of people living horrible 
lives because ... medicines keep 
them alive.... Its a horrible death, 
and thats definitely not how I 
want to die.... The dementia, the 
pneumonia, the little viral infec
tions all over ... I cant imagine 
being that sick.
I dont know [if Ill live to see 
one]. Only God knows. Id like to 
wake up one morning and hear it 
on the news and see everyone in 
line at the clinic for treatment.
Susans everyday life has defi
nitely changed, but her life has 
still maintained some likeness to 
normalcy. I get tired a lot and I 
have to make sure I rest and eat 
right, but, for the most part I feel 
great, she says. Susan is now 
attending college and feels very 
strongly the will to live. When I 
was seventeen and eighteen, I 
tried to kill myself because I just 
didnt want to live. Now Id do 
almost anything to survive. 
Giving talks about what it is 
like to live with the AIDS virus is 
difficult for Susan, but she also 
believes it to be very necessary. 
The reason Im here... is because
people know so little about the 
disease ... and I know for myself, 
an awful lot of my fear went away 
when I got myself educated about 
the it, she said. Education is 
important for both sides of the 
problem [those with the disease 
and those without it].
Education is the strongest tool 
against HIV, ARC, and AIDS. It 
is also what is needed to help 
victims cope with the viruses. 
People think it cant happen to 
them, they think its certain 
peoples disease, and its not. Its 
gone too far a long time ago for 
that to be true, Susan said.
Its everybodys disease. .,

afflicted by the virus. In an interview 
Friday, Hughes brought some pertinent 
issues to a personal level.
I think what most people dont under
stand about AIDS is that AIDS itself is 
not a disease, he said, but what AIDS 
does is allow you to get diseases that you 
would not normally get. The most com
mon one, pneumocystis, is actually an 
animal disease; people dont generally 
get that. But when your immune system 
is lowered, youre opened up to things 
that would not normally occur in a 
-healthy person. Its justwhat the acronym 
says, Acquired Immune Deficiency. 
Unlike most victims of the virus, 
Hughes foresaw his diagnosis. Mine was 
a bit of an unusual circumstance because 
my partner was diagnosed with AIDS 
first, he said. I automatically assumed 
I had to be positive. It was only until I 
started having health problems that I 
went and had the tests done.
Hughes explained that even minor ill
nesses can be serious to those diagnosed 
with HIV. This summer I managed to
pick up Athletes Foot, 
which everyone thinks of 
as an incredibly minor 
annoyance, he said, but 
for someone with an im
paired immune system, 
it can be very serious, and 
its very difficult to get rid 
of.
While having HIV has 
not slowed him down,
Hughes has felt its toll in 
small, everyday ways. He 
is grateful to his employ
ers for their understand
ing of his condition. It 
makes it a little difficult, because when 
youre in a situation like Im in with 
ARC, you have good days and bad days, 
he said. Most of the time you feel very, 
very normal, you feel there is nothing 
wrong. But when you have a bad day, you 
know, its not uncommon for me to wake 
up on a Monday morning with a 104 
fever. And you know whoever you hap
pen to be working for has to be terribly 
understanding because I probably call

off work at least once every other week. 
However, not everyone has been so un
derstanding.
I would be less than honest if I said we 
[Hughes and his partner] havent lost 
friends as a result of this because obvi
ously some people are more tolerant, are 
more understanding than others. Its a 
matter of knowledge, he said. If people 
know and understand it, they know that 
theyre perfectly safe. But there is still a
paranoia. Ive lost some 
friends, but then in a 
sense, you also find out 
who your really good 
friends are.
Emotional support is 
available in Pittsburgh, 
though, through the 
Pittsburgh AIDS Task 
Force (PATF) and the 
Percod Center. PATF has 
a special fund for victims. 
It wont pay for medica
tion, said Hughes, be
cause that would get to be 
too expensive, but [if] 
someone is going to lose [his] car or lose 
[her] apartment because they cant afford 
to pay for it, then the task force will give 
them that money.
Both his work with PATF and his sup
port from Percod have helped him. Ev
eryone copes with it differently. Ive been 
fortunate in that I saw it coming, so its 
not the devastating blow that it is to a lot 
of people. I see a counselor at Percod 
because I get depressed every once in a
50+
while. Its not an easy thing to live with'.1
In addition to emotional strain, 'tlYe' 
financial strain that AIDS exerts ddif 
devastate some victims. One thing tKaft 
a lot of people dont understand... is'li< 
financial aspect of it. And thats one 
reason that the task force does so muchto try and assist people, he said. A [two 
week] prescription of AZT costs about 
$200. Before I knew of no avenue for 
help, we ran up our charge card charging' 
AZT.... So it can be financially devastating' 
to any one whos HIV positive or has 
AIDS just to get the medication.
Researchers are coming closer every
day, but a cure is only a possiblity in the 
very distant future. Until then, Hughes' 
promotes the practice of safe sex, some
thing he and his partner hadnt heard of 
until after it was too late. Lastly, and 
perhaps most importantly, Hughes em
phasizes that understanding is neces
sary, for everyone.

Do the Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity libraries haveadequa te 
resources for your research?
Carolyn Duran 
Junior, Mems
Yes, its had what I need. At 
least, the E&S [Engineering and 
Science] library."
Cliff Snider 
Senior, CFA
Well, the problem Ive found 
is that the professors take out 
research books that I need for the 
whole semester.
Michael Nappi 
fifth year, Mems/EPP
No It doesn't really...and It's a 
nuisance, too, that all the really 
good dot matrix printers are not 
accessible.
Aaron Benjamin 
Senior, H&SS
Yes, it does, but that's 
because my department [psy
chology] has a lot of money, so 
they fund It."
Michael Shea 
Junior, MCS/CS
My research really hasnt' 
been all that extensive, but when' 
I did research, information was' 
there, and it tended to give rise to 
more Interesting topics which 
were not available."

The Far Side is a daily feature in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette,The party-goers were enjoying themselves 
immensely  unaware that, across the street 
in the shadows, a killer waited.
Fleaboys
"Hold still, Omar.... Now look up. Yep. 
You've got something in your eye, all right 
 could be sand."
And so it went, night after night, year after year. 
In fact, the Hansens had been in a living hell 
ever since that fateful day the neighbor's 
For Sale" sign had come down and a 
family of howler monkeys had moved in.
'That story again? ... Well, one stormy night, when 
the whole family was asleep, your grandfather 
quietly rose from his bed, took an ax, and made 
aaaaaall you little grandkids."
In a recurring nightmare, Arsenio Hall sees himself 
walk onstage wearing golf clothes.

hTT / dcl.p cN Misery dc PclU pcaoT/P .pvvU
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Sports Editor
Ifyoure feeling extraordinarily 
happy and festive this season, 
and you need an antidote to the 
holiday cheer, dont worry  it 
can be taken care of.
Just go catch the movie Misery. 
Its a pretty potent remedy to the 
sheer joy of the season.
This latest adaptation of the 
Stephen King novel of the same 
title delivers everything its 
brooding title promises. All the 
elements are intact  mystery, 
suspense, and some humorand 
theyre all in the right places. 
Misery is an excellent film that 
'grabs the viewer from the first 
scene and doesnt loosen its grip 
until the credits roll.
Although lacking a star-stud
ded cast, Misery is backed by the 
talents and reputation of director 
Rob Reiner (The Sure Thing, The
 Movie Review 
? ??? MISERY. A popular ro
mance novelist meets his biggest 
fan and discovers that the price of 
fame is higher than he thought. 
Starring James Caan and Kathy 
Bates. Directed by Rob Reiner.
Princess Bride, When Harry Met 
Sally...). And even though she is 
not well known in the movie busi
ness, Kathy Bates delivers an 
impressive performance opposite 
James Caan.
Paul Sheldon (Caan) is a novel
ist famous for a series of books 
revolving around a heroine named 
Misery Chastain. However, hes 
sick and tired of writing romantic 
novels and wishes to start writ
ing serious novels.
So he holes himself up in a cabin 
in the middle of Nowhere, Colo
rado, writes his serious novel, 
and begins his long drive back to 
New York. However, before he 
can get the only copy of his latest 
manuscript to his publisher, he 
has a horrible car accident during 
a blizzard.
Lucky for him, Paul has a 
guardian angel. Still alive, hes 
pried out of the car and carried 
away to safety. He wakes up two 
days later to find himself with a 
broken arm, two broken legs, 
numerous scratches, and under 
the care of a sweet lady named 
Annie Wilkes (Bates).
Fortunately, Aimie is a nurse. 
Well, Annie was a nurse. She lost 
her job and was sent to prison for 
killing babies in a hospitals nurs
ery ward. But Paul does not know 
this, and at first he trusts this 
woman who constantly says shes 
his number one fan and idolizes 
Misery, to put it mildly.
At first, everything is kosher.
This latest adaptation of the Stephen 
King novel of the same title delivers 
everything its brooding title promises.
Annie feeds Paul at his bedside 
and gives him medicine. Shed 
take him to a hospital, but all the 
phones lines are down, and the 
roads are impassable. No one 
knows where he is.
Then Annie reads Pauls newly 
completed Misery novel, and 
oops!, he killed off Misery in the 
last chapter.
Uh-oh. Hell hath no fury like a 
woman whose favorite character 
was just killed. No one knows 
Paul is there, and hes defense
less in his condition. Torching the 
original manuscript, Annie tells 
Paul he will write his master
piece, in which he will resurrect
Misery. By now, Paul has deduced 
that his number one fan is a 
full-fledged psychopath.
Paul is in no mood to write a 
whole novel, but the idea of stay
ing alive is appealing enough to 
him, so he plugs away. At the 
same time, he engineers some 
pretty creative schemes to'escape 
the wrath of Annie. Several times 
throughout the movie it looks as 
though hell outwit her, but you 
know he wont, because the movie 
would be over prematurely.
Be prepared when you go see 
this movie  there are some 
pretty stomach-wrenching scenes. 
But Reiner took the conservative
route on the gore and blood, which 
is refreshing amidst the barrage 
of slasher movies such as Childs 
Play, or Friday the 13th. Al
though I witnessed a few scenes 
through the spaces between my 
fingers, and my movie companion 
complained about the fingernail 
indentations I .left in his palms, 
most of the movie is bearable.
Get ready for some great laughs 
too. For example, Annie Wilkes 
despises swearing, so she invents 
such words as cock-a-doodie for 
those moments when shes really 
frustrated. Well, I guess you had 
to be there. There are some truly 
funny moments in Misery, which 
balance nicely with the suspense.
Put Misery on your list of mustsees while youre home for the 
break  you wont be disap
pointed. Take a friend to hang 
onto also. But dont lean back too 
comfortably in your seat, because 
youll be on the edge of it soon.

What can be said about Madonna, 
ubiquitous pop empress of the last decade, 
that wouldnt be gross overgeneral
ization?
Whether you cite it as artistic diversity 
or stylistic diarrhea, the fact remains 
that her songs trod across the toes of so 
many genres that it seems that their 
only common denominator is their vocal
ist and that monotonous perk that un
mistakably qualifies them as pop.
Can one truly claim to like or.dislike 
Madonna? Condemning her early hits 
like Lucky Star as lobotomized glamor 
puts one in an awkward position when 
presented with psychologically-drenched 
pieces like Live to Tell; and snorting

defenseless against being dragged onto

Consequently, a compilation like 
Madonnas recently-released Immacu

thematic whole than a chronology of the

December  the month of heated de
liberation for television networks across 
the country. Its time to decide which TV 
programs shall live and which shall die. 
Let us take a brief glance at what is still 
being offered for viewers out in TV land.
Amen is back. For those of you who 
have felt a little odd and out-of-sync for 
the past few months, the absence of Amen 
is probably the reason. Thats right, folks: 
Sherman Hemsley, that lovable, huggable man from The Jeffersons, is finally 
back for a fifth season as Deacon Frye. 
Rejoice, for the world is whole again.
Saturday Night Live just isnt 
funny anymore. At a recent showing of 
said program, a full 100% of the viewers
present failed to laugh once (and 50% 
actively frowned through the last fortyfive minutes). Chevy, John, Gilda, Jane: 
come back!
An hour of laughs when you need 
it most!??! Come on  is there a living 
being in this World who finds Mamas 
Family even remotely entertaining? More 
than one episode in one sitting is liable to 
cause ones dinner to reverse direction.
Zoom back in time with the 
Robinson family. Remember that allAmerican family that was Lost in Space? 
Relive those magical moments, complete 
with the Robot (Danger, Will 
Robinson!), weekdays at 10 am on USA. 
Camp in the extreme.
Andy Griffith is leaving Matlock. 
Tuesday nights just wont be the same.
Them toons is everywhere. Bugs
Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and/or 
their offspring seem to be on TV all the 
time. (You can find em on channel 53, 
Nickelodeon, and TNT every day.) Is this 
too much of a good thing?
Watch the beginning of Growing 
Pains. Theres a neat new a cappella 
version of the theme song. Very cool.
Just when you thought it was 
safe to turn on the TV again.... USA is 
running repeats of Just the Ten of Us 
weekday afternoons. You have been 
warned.
Theres some worthwhile stuff on 
channel 22. This station is pushing 
Classic TV, including four of the best 
sitcoms ever produced. Catch em if you 
can: Taxi weekdays at noon, All in the 
Family weekdays at 12:30 pm, The Dick

Human life could not exist 
without music. Neil Diamond 
would never have crooned his way 
through the Jazz Singer. Julio 
Iglesias would not have made our 
mothers drool. Crystal Gayle 
would not amaze us with her ag
ile ability to avoid stepping on her 
Rapunzel-like hair.
Okay, so youre not a big fan of 
Crystals Dont It Make My 
Brown Eyes Blue, but dont un
derestimate yourself. Our taste 
>n music is always changing. 
Someday you may even appreciate Pat Boone.
My first experience with music 
ls what every six-year-old would 
tall a Sesa?ne Street nightmare. 
While Mom and Dad went out on 
the town on a Saturday night, 
Grandma Molly would teach me 
about culture. She made me watch 
the Lawrence Wellz Show.
Watching ole Larry in his little 
blue polyester suit did nothing to 
heighten my musical insight. After all, the highlights of his show 
Were the accordion player who 
yodeled and the Geritol vitamin 
commercials that were cast with 
several members of the band. 
Obviously, the show was
DOING THE TIME WARP
by Marni Borek
to an older and more sophisti
cated audience.
When Grandma Molly decided 
she was not being paid enough 
money to watch me, my parents 
hired a babysitter. Thank God! 
This meant I could watch the 
Mister Rogers reruns and 3-2-1 
Contact on Channel 21.
I was dead wrong.
Dawn was one of those promis
cuous sixteen-year-olds who al
ways talked about what a nice 
butt Donny Osmond had. Hey, I 
was only six  I only knew of the 
important biological functions of 
a butt.
I was coerced into watching the 
Donny and Marie Show. The 
brother and sister team sang such 
songs as If I Make You Feel
Groovy, Ill Be Groovy Too. Of 
course their rendition of the tune 
did nothing to promote the image 
of an incestuous relationship!
After several more nightmar
ish musical experiences with The 
Barbara Mandrell Show and 
Barry Manilow in Concert, I was 
fed up. Would I be stuck for the 
rest of my childhood years lis
tening to the horrible sounds of 
performers who sounded like 
Kermit the Frog going through a 
voice change or only belonged on 
the dentists office radio sta
tions? It was time to take action. 
It was time to do what us Top 40 
six-year-olds called boogie down.
On any seventh birthday I was 
given a transistor radio. It was 
small, orange, ugly, and extremely 
cheap, but it was all my Grandma 
Molly was willing to give me. But 
hey, at least she didnt give me 
her autographed copy of Lawrence 
Welks Greatest Hits. I began lis
tening to the popular music sta
tions.
The sounds that first hit my 
naive ears were the screeches of 
Blondie. Call me ooohhh, you can 
call me call me anytime. Then 
there was Donna Summer. Last
Would I be stuck for the rest of my 
childhood years listening to the hor

sounded like Kermit the Frog going

stations?
chance, last dance tonight...Then 
Dionne Warwick emerged. Walk 
on by... oohh walk on by... if you 
see me on the street walk on by.
By age ten I wanted to focus on 
only a small variety of music. I 
wanted a tape recorder. After 
begging my parents for weeks 
during their favorite segment of 
The Tonight Show, I was finally 
granted my wish.
When I came home from school 
after a tedious multiplication test, 
I found a shiny red tape recorder 
on my bed along with two cassettes
 Michael Jacksons Off the Wall 
and Kool and the Gang. The house 
was pervaded with the sounds of 
music in its true forms. Celebrate
good times come on! Its a cel
ebration....
Everyday I would bring my little 
red tape recorder to school and 
play music during snack time. 
Quickly I became The Most 
Popular Girl In The School. My 
ego was most certainly boosted:
Soon I bought some more cas
settes, such as The Village People 
and Pat Benatars Get Nervous. A 
group of girls and myself would 
hold dance contests near the 
hopscotch board during recess. 
We would jump around to Pat 
Benatars Shadow of the Night 
and do the hand motions to the 
Village Peoples YMCA with the 
school bus drivers who were eat
ing lunch in the cafeteria. Life 
was pure bliss. I had my group of 
followers and my shiny red tape 
recorder.
Tragedy struck when the boom 
box became affordable to the 
middle class. Joanna Ellwood 
brought one to school in sixth 
grade and took over my position 
as The Most Popular Girl In The 
School. I was up in arms.
I tried to bringing in some more 
updated cassettes like Michael 
Jacksons Thriller and the 
Flashdance soundtrack. Every
one was excited by my new col
lection, but requested that the 
tapes be played on Joannas boom 
box. I was hit with preteen de
pression and everybody contin
ued to dance. Shes a maniac 
maniac on the floor. And shes 
dancin like shes never danced 
before....

Dear Santa,
Lately Ive been feeling a little 
blue, so could you please give me 
the following comic books to bring 
some cheer back into my life? Not 
just any comics, but funny comics. 
You know, the kind that bringjoy 
to the world, the kind that put 
smiles on everyones faces. Santa, 
bring me the gift of laughter!
Theres this one comic book 
called Flaming Carrot which is 
guaranteed to leave you Ho Ho 
Ho-ing. The premise of the story 
is that a nutty guy once was bet to 
read 5,000 comics all at the same 
time. He of course accepted the 
challenge and successfully com
pleted the bet, but the effects were 
dramatic and everlasting.
When he awoke to look in the 
mirror, he saw that his head had 
been replaced by a flaming carrot! 
Any other man would have stuck 
his head in a Cuisinart and ended 
it all, but this man was no normal 
man. No, he turned tragedy into 
triumph and became a bonafide 
super hero! Now you can see him 
flying through the dark night, 
with only the flame erupting from 
his carrot head to light his lonely 
path.
The basis of other humor comCOMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
ics seems to be superhero parody. 
The laughs essentially come from 
making fun of the traditional 
concept of a superhero. Youve 
seen the joke where the comic 
book character proclaims some
thing to the effect of Gosh, what 
do you think this is, a comic book? 
Humor comics like these are es
sentially based on this one joke. 
After youve seen it told a million 
different ways, its bound to leave 
even Frosty the Snowman feeling 
cold! Ha!
But writer/artist Bob Burdens 
presentation of Flaming Carrot 
seems to have avoided this trap. 
This comic book is not a parody, 
and it is not filled with humor 
that insults your intelligence. It 
is sophisticated, yet very simple.
One recent story documented a 
day in the life of Flaming Carrot.
He woke up in the morning, 
walked around, visited the folks 
in his community, meditated on a 
park bench, and enjoyed the 
simple pleasures of life. The story 
telling is natural and very well 
paced. The artwork is strong, 
crisp, and not too busy. The book 
has an amazing quality in that if 
you read any one panel, its not 
only funny but it seems to stand 
on its own. Flaming Carrot glows 
with a wit and warmth that would 
put Rudolphs nose to shame.
Another comic on my Christ
mas list is Groo the Wanderer. 
There is nothing subtle about this 
book. Its about the misadventures 
of a sword-wielding barbarian 
who is, without a doubt, the stu
pidest man in the world. If youve 
lost all self-respect or are just 
plain down on yourself, then read 
this book to feel better. Writer 
Mark Evaniers work is elegant 
and well structured. Though each 
story seems to be the same, with 
Groo messing up in a BIG way, 
Evaniers unique delivery keeps 
the stories as fresh as snowflakes.
The artwork is masterfully ren
dered by artist Sergio Aragones, 
whose work has appeared in Mad 
Magazine. The figures are all

gency Broadcast System.
The two previously unreleased 
singles on this album are musi
cally austere, particularly Jus
tify My Love, which features a 
rhythmic and breathy recital to 
what sounds like frying eggs in 
the background.
Nor is this music that makes 
immense demands upon your 
attentional capacities. Madonnas 
tunes are music to do things to -
be it dancing, or changing the 
radio station. You may enjoy these 
past hits, but dont expect to be 
able to sit crosslegged on' a 
mountaintop and allow them to 
permeate your soul.
Summarizing this collection is 
like summarizing a Personix 
catalogue. To give you ad hoc 
descriptions of each individual 
song is fairly pointless, so Ill have 
to refer you to your own empirical 
observations in conclusion.
Maybe you should change that channel

College students who 
watch Charles in Charge on a 
regular basis. What causes this 
grotesque obsession? On the next

 Late-Night Fun Time. Turn
on the TV anytime after midnight, 
any station. Count the number of 
commercials that are not sexist. 
(Good luck.)
Just wondering.... Wouldnt 
an animated Don Knotts be re
dundant?
 Avoid this show at all costs. 
Marsha Warfield, who is a tal
ented comedian and one of the 
funnier members of Night Court, 
is a horrible talk-show host. She 
cant interview, she isnt funny, 
and she has the Most Annoying 
Laugh on Television (unseating 
the former champion, Joan Riv
ers).
Stuff were sick of seeing.
Televangelists, smarmy gameshow hosts, home video shows,
It brings out the best 
in all of us.

Groo might not have manners, but
caricatures, for this is truly a 
comic in the traditional Sunday 
newspaper comic sense. The hall
mark of the art is the incredible 
detail in Aragons artwork. Groo 
the Wanderer, or better yet Groo 
the Idiot, would make even the 
Grinch break into laughter!
On the other end of the laugh 
spectrum is the remarkably darkhumored Eightball. The book is 
subtle, provocative, and may leave 
you feeling guilty for laughing. 
Writer/artist Daniel Cloves anhe sure can deliver a joke.
thology format allows him to cre
ate a comic under whose humor
ous facade lies a disturbing social 
. commentary which rings fright
eningly true. The artwork is la
bored and compact. The artist has 
put what feels like sixty-four 
pages of story into 32 carefully 
structured, very dense pages. 
Hypocrisy, the dangers of blind 
faith, and nursing homes are just 
a few of the topics in this surreal 
Yuletide treat. Eightball is obvi
ously a book that has had a lot of
W990 ^Xs'(D tsI'Dy6
care put into it, and it shows.

Hi dc dpv pPiv cU dpv iUo.v
ESSE since Nintendos Game Boy came 
ut last year companies have stopped 
king into making their systems bigger 
ncfbetter, but rather smaller and beter. Soon after the Game Boy arrived the 
tari Lynx came out. The Lynx has been 
[yingGame Boy and Nintendo no end of 
iuble with its color screen, greater 
ovver, and better games. The only reajthe Lynx hasnt completely stolen 
ieaine Boys thunder is because of the 
leeivsize and power of Nintendo and the 
iclfco support for the Lynx. 
feU; you better polish up those game 
Iree'ns, cause theres a new kid on the 
lock which has more power and colors 
ian the Game Boy and Lynx combined! 
s name  TurboExpress.
Ever since early July when NEC first 
nnounced that it was releasing the 
urboExpress  which is nothing more 
ian a portable TurboGrafix-16  the 
deo game world has been anxiously 
aiting for its arrival.
However, a few months ago, NEC anounced that it was only going to release 
)00 TurboExpresses or so and only in 
alifornia and New York before ChristThe rest of the 48 states would have 
wait until after Christmas to get their 
ands on one of these babies.
Since I happen to live in New York, I 
no problem getting one over the 
eak and trying it out. However, the one 
ig question which plagued my mind 
fter I bought the TurboExpress: Is it 
orth the price?
You see, if you want state-of-the-art 
deo gaming power its going to cost you 
J50 just for the TurboExpress itself, 
nd if you want to play games on it, itll 
1st you an additional $50 to $60 dollars 
so for each cartridge.
Considering the fact that a full fledged 
uiboGrafix-16 only costs around $160, 
ie:big question which popped into my 
ia]d over and over again was, is the
PRESS START
by Stephen Glicker
TurboExpress worth an extra $90 just 
for portability?
After a week of constant gameplay my 
answer is no.
Sure, the TurboExpress is an extremely 
nice unit. Its only slightly larger than 
the Game Boy and weighs around 20 
ounces with batteries. The color screen is 
simply amazing, with a total of 74,256 
pixels of resolution. And the sound is 
loud and crystal clear.
Still, I had two complaints with the 
TurboExpress. It eats batteries too fast, 
and its just too damn small.
The TurboExpress requires six AA 
batteries to run, which only last a 
maximum of 3 to 5 hours. Even with the 
sound turned down all the way, this 
puppy eats batteries like popcorn.
There is good news on the horizon, 
however. NEC does plan to release an 
AC adapter in the near future for the 
TurboExpress, but that would mean that 
it would no longer be a totally portable 
system. In my mind that completely kills 
the idea of a portable system and is a big 
strike against the TurboExpress.
As for the size of screen, its small, real 
small: only one and a half by two inches. 
With a screen this small, some of the 
games are almost impossible to play. 
Blazing Lazers becomes a bit of an eye
sore after awhile trying to read the num
bers and characters on the power-up
capsules, and the best game ever re
leased for the TurboGrafix-16, Military 
Madness, is just about impossible to play 
on the TurboExpress:
Even some of the games which have 
bigger and moredefined graphics, like 
Neutopia, are hard to play on the 
TurboExpress. The colors seem to have a 
bad habit of melting into each other 
and producing strange results. A perfect 
example is the supposedly white letters 
in Neutopia which end up becoming a 
mixture of white, blue, and red on the 
TurboExpress.
In addition, the TurboExpress screen 
has a nasty habit of burning images 
into itself. What this means is, if youre 
playing a game like Military Madness 
which spends a}ot of time on displaying 
maps and charts, and then quickly 
switches to the battlefield, you can see a 
ghost image of the maps and charts 
overlaying the battlefield. Not only is 
this affect very annoying but it can per
manently damage your TurboExpress 
after a period of time.
Finally, the simple problem that the 
TurboExpress doesnt have the best se
lection of games and is slowly dying in 
the video game world poses a whole new 
set of problems.
All in all, I dont think that the 
TurboExpress is worth its price tag. My 
advice is that if you dont own a 
TurboGrafix-16 and want the 
TurboExpress, buy it at a place like Toys 
R Us where you can return just in case 
youre not happy with it (like I did). And 
for those of you who already own a 
TurboGrafix-16, dont waste your money.
Dont tune in next week, because there 
is no next week! Happy holidays!

Glicker is a junior policy & mangement

games you want this holiday season.

After Burner II for the Genesis. Ex
cept for Blue Lighting this is the best 
fighter pilot game ever made for a home 
system. Okay graphics (sometimes they 
will take your breath away, other times 
you' II want to cry), okay music, and great 
gameplay but gets boring too quickly. 
Overall rating: 6.
 Bonk's Adventure for the TurboGrafix16. Take Mario and put him in a prehis
toric setting  it works. Great graphics, 
very good sound, and great gameplay. 
Overall rating: 8.
Budokan for the Genesis. Probably 
the best graphics ever seen on the Gen
esis to date. Too bad the game sucks so 
much. Drop dead graphics, excellent 
sound, atrocious gameplay. Overall rat
ing: 3.
Dragon Warrior II for Nintendo. If you 
liked the first one, then you'll like this 
one. Cute graphics, okay sound, and 
addictive gameplay. Overall rating: 8.
 Klax for every system. Another puzzle 
game a la Tetris except that Klax puts 
Tetris to shame. Move over Tetris, Klax is 
new king of the hill. Very good graphics, 
hysterical sound effects, and addictive 
gameplay. Overall rating: 10.
Little Nemo The Dream Master for
Nintendo. Borrows a lotfrom Super Mario 
Bros, but you know what? It works! Amaz
ing graphics, great sound, addictive 
gameplay. Overall rating: 9.
Michael Jacksons Moonwalker for
the Genesis. Even if you hate Michael 
Jackson you can't help but love this 
game. Unbelievable graphics, magnifi
cent music and sound, and great 
gameplay, but it's too easy to reach the 
end. Overall rating: 8.
 Military Madness forthe TurboGrafix16. An old game, but if you dont already 
own it buy it right away. Best strategy 
game ever to come out for a home sys
tem to date. Great graphics, excellent 
sound, and amazing gameplay. Overall 
rating: 10.
Mystic Defender for the Genesis. An 
old game, but very rarely seen these 
days. The best action game currently 
available for the Genesis in my opinion. 
Beautiful graphics, amazing sound, and 
mind-boggling gameplay. Buy it while you 
still can. Overall rating: 10.
Neutopia for the TurboGrafix-16. Al
most an exact copy of The Legend ofZelda 
for the Nintendo, but then again, I loved 
that game. Great graphics, good sound, 
and superb gameplay. it'll keep you com
ing back for more. Overall rating: 9.
 Pat Riley Basketball for the Genesis. 
One of the best sports games ever made 
for a home system with amazing two 
player action. Excellent graphics, good 
sound, superb two player gameplay, and 
okay one player gameplay (it gets boring 
quick). Overall rating: 7.
Revenge of the Gator for the Game 
Boy. Portable pinball with gators all over 
the place. A great game which never gets 
boring. Excellent graphics, good sound, 
addictive gameplay. Overall rating: 9.
Super Mario Bros. 3 for Nintendo. 
Even though it didn't seem possible, 
Nintendo surpassed the original. Super 
Mario Bros. 3 is so packed full of action, 
adventure, and different settings, how 
can you not love this game? Amazing 
graphics (I still dont know how Nintendo 
pulled it off), classic Mario Bros, sound 
and music, as well as addictive gameplay. 
Overall rating: 10.
Sword of Vermillion for the Genesis. 
Not a bad role-playing game, but when 
you play it you can't but think that some
thing is missing. Not bad graphics, amaz
ing music, and okay gameplay. Not nearly 
worth the $75 it'll cost you. Overall rat
ing: 6.

IME WARP, from page Lll
hange. Wham made its grand 
itrance with Wake Me Up Bere You Go-Go, Whitney HousDn hit it big with Saving All My 
ove For You, and Boy George, 
earing his makeup by Revlon, 
pked us all his famous question:
0 you really want to hurt me? 
his music trivia did not affect 
e. I wanted to be different. It 
as time to go alternative.
1 began listening to new wave 
Depeche Mode, the Cure, Yaz.... 
iltered my wardrobe to indicate
|y change in musical taste. I had 
|he black jeans, the black jean 
racket, the black hair rinse, and, 
|f course, the little buttons with 
ctures of my favorite bands to 
ear on my jacket. It was a more
sophisticated step up from my 
Madonna phase. By the end of the 
year, though, I became restless 
and returned to more popular 
music.
The summer approached. Camp 
time. It is a proven fact that people 
are more nostalgic about summer 
music. Those summer songs just 
imprint themselves in your mind 
and stay there forever, remind
ing you of the good times and the 
times you have made a total ass of 
yourself. The three biggest songs 
of my thirteenth summer were 
St. Elmos Fire, Summer of 69, 
and Heaven.
St. Elmos Fire was the song 
of all rollerskating rinks across 
the United States. On rainy days 
all campers would always be at
Skate Factory stumbling and rac
ing across the rink because some 
moron was always requesting the 
damn song. Frustrated by the 
repetition, I found myself falling 
more often in the rink. Although 
the experience was quite painful, 
I did develop the most colorful 
bruises I have ever seen.
Summer of 69 was the bus 
trip tune played during our daily 
excursions to the beach. I can still 
feel the sand underneath my 
armpits, and in between my toes, 
every time I hear the song now. 
Oh, those sticky volleyball games 
and the sneaker burying contests. 
Bryan Adams lyrics were known 
almost as well as Billy Joels 
Goodnight Saigon. Just picture 
it... a group of screaming adoles
cents attempting to sound like a 
Hallelujah chorus singing Sum
mer of 69 on the trip back from 
the beach. Scary, huh?
Heaven was one of those 
mushy songs that spurs the aver
age young teenager to participate 
in a quick gameof Spin the Bottle. 
The Y Teen tour stud, Brian 
Lieberman, always had a Pepsi 
bottle handy. It was my luck to 
always have the bottle land on 
Dave the slob who I had to bribe 
with two dollars and a piece of 
Bazooka to kiss me as far away 
from the mouth as possible.
So, what do I think of the music 
of today? Its pretty cool  if it is 
mixed with music of the past. 
Listening to Stevie B, Bell Biv 
Devoe, and Taylor Dayne can turn
the most avid music listener into 
a monster who can only appreci
ate synthesized beats. You have 
to bring out the music of the past 
with real guitars and drums  
Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, and 
Fleetwood Mac.
As one may see from my expe
riences with music, musical tastes 
are constantly changing. Dont be 
surprised if you wake up one 
morning and have the urge to 
listen to Uncle Bernies Frank 
Sinatra collection instead of the 
usual Peter Gabriel. Dont be ap
palled if Donna Summer CDs 
replace the Mozart and Brahms 
CDs on your shelf. Musical taste 
is not sparked by outside factors 
all the time. As the new but very 
wise group Deee-lite once sang:
Groove is in the heart.

Mortar Board, Carnegie Mellon University 
Chapter of the National Honor Society, is 
participating in the Salvation Army 
Toys-for-Tots Program once again this 
year. In the past we have collected many 
toys, but this year we are taking a different 
approach to providing for needy families.
We have 'adopted' a family for this 
Christmas Season. We are hopeful that the 
campus community can provide toys and 
clothes (preferably new) for the four 
children of our adopted family, which has 
met Salvation Army requirements for need. 
The father is employed full-time at a job 
paying minimum wage. The mother attends 
to the needs of her son and her three 
daughters. The children's names and ages 
are: Linda (12), Joanne (8), Ira (7, boy), 
and Brittany a 18-month old girl.
We have randomly selected colleges to personally adopt a specific child, in an attempt 
to collect an even amount of toys and clothing for each child. The assignments are as 
follows, although any donation will be gladly accepted:
CIT............Linda CFA..................Ira
MCS...........Joanne H&SS & GSIA...Brittany
A collection box will be located in the dean's offices of each respective college. The 
donations will be picked up periodically throughout the upcoming weeks. The 
deadline for donations is December 14th. If you would like to have a member of 
Mortar Board personally pick-up any gifts or if you have any questions, please call 
Jeffrey Housenbold at 268-5919 or Andy Lee at 268-8379.
The Salvation Army, the members of Mortar Board, and most importantly the 
members of our 'adopted' family thank you for your generosity.

Most of yall know that I been 
Hooking for a decent job for years.
I know I know I know, Im world 
famous as a drive-in movie critic, 
and if I ever changed jobs, thou!sands of people would find a huge 
Void in their lives. But Im talking 
'about a job where I could reach 
millions of people.
I wanna be a Catholic priest.
Theyre begging people to take 
this job. Theyve got 75 million 
Catholics in the USA, the 
churches are getting huger and 
huger, and the number of priests 
\s getting smaller and smaller, 
and now they got Holy Fathers 
out there on the recruiting trail, 
showing film strips to high school 
seniors, asking new priests to 
'bring a friend down to the office 
and try on this here dog collar. 
Theyre desperate.
Up in Chicago, theyre even 
Svilling to pump up the salaries a 
little bit, because priests have 
been dropping like flies. Theyve 
lost so many priests up there that 
they now have Catholic MPs that 
patrol up and down Michigan 
Avenue on weekdays, rousting 
runaway clergy out of advertising 
agencies. Ever since Pope John 
Paul the Sequel got into office, its 
been crystal clear that the num
ber one priestly rule-change was 
never gonna get past the Holy 
Unified Committee of Senile 
Bishops. You know which rule 
Im talking about:
Nonookie.
Back in the sixties and seven
ties, it was starting to look good 
ifor the old ecclesiasticus 
aardvarkus, if you know what I 
'mean and I think you do. The 
priests and nuns figured, Well 
swing with this a few more years, 
and-maybe theyll at least let us 
imarry some ugly Pakistani 
women or something.
1 But John Paul His Polishness
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
pretty much wiped that out when 
he said: No nookie for priests. No 
abortion. No birth control. No pre
marital sex. And the guys in Chi
cago tried to reason with him, but 
they got an idea of just how seri
ous he was when he ordered sev
eral countries in Southeast Asia 
to be spayed and neutered.
So thats a drawback. Thats 
uncool.
But not for me  because I 
never have sex anyway.
You see the beauty here? 
Through the majesty of Gods 
plan, you take something thats 
embarrassing and it becomes an 
asset. You can say stuff like, See 
that Raquel Welch lookalike over 
there with the high heels whos 
wearing the bra on the outside of 
her dress? Yeah, her  the one 
thats working the Etch-a-Sketch 
with her thighs. Now, see the 
Kevin Costner lookalike who just 
walked up to her and is now 
touching her waist? I want you to 
know something: That no longer 
bothers me  because I couldnt 
have her anyway.
Isnt this great?
Okay, whats the next one?
Poverty.
Perfect. I love poverty. The 
church pays for the food. You wear 
the same clothes every day. And 
you still get a check! But you dont 
have to be responsible. You dont 
have to save up for the little rugSUMMER SPECIAL

Then we got  oh yeah  obe
dience. Or, as we say in Latin, 
shutta yo mouth. This is the 
easiest one of all. Here, Ive been 
practicing:
Yes sir, Mr. Archbishop Sir, I 
do believe, Sir, that the Pope is 
infallible. I know this because, in 
1870, the Pope decided he was 
infallible. He told everyone he was 
infallible, and so, if he was infal
lible, then he couldnt be wrong 
deciding he was infallible, be
cause that was his first infallible 
act, to declare himself infallible.... 
Of course, in 1869, the Pope was 
full of dog doo.
Yes sir, Mr. Archbishop Sir, I 
think God did intend for us to use 
the rhythm method of birth con
trol. Yesterday I counseled one of 
my parishioners to mark his cal
endar and set his alarm clock to 
throw caution to the winds and 
rip his wifes clothes off on the 
24th at 9 pm. Theyre quite look
ing forward to it.
And, of course, Ive been pre
paring for this job for years. I saw 
the original Exorcist 34 times. I 
watched every single Bing Crosby 
movie where he was a Catholic 
priest who sang ballads. And I 
was the first person on earth to 
review the most famous drive-in 
double feature ever programmed
 and, I can see now that it was 
a Roman Catholic twin bill: I 
Drink Your Blood and I Eat Your 
Skin.
Im ready. Take me. Bless me, 
Father, for I have written this 
column, and I wont be able to go
to Chicago for at least eight years.
And speaking of blood in Chi
cago, Chucky the Killer Doll is 
back for Childs Play 2 even 
though the toy-company stock
holders are a little jittery about 
keeping a toy on the market thats 
been accused of being a serial 
murderer and stealing the souls 
of children. But they figure, Hey, 
if the federal government says its 
a safe toy, it must be a safe toy. 
Its just a bunch of negative pub
licity. And so they step up massproduction of the little frecklefaced talking demon rug-rat with 
the filthy mouth.
Unfortunately, Andys mom, 
who witnessed Chuckys murders 
in the first movie, has been hauled 
off to the loony bin, and Andy is 
sent to a foster home. Meanwhile, 
Chucky is being reassembled by 
the toy-company engineers, who 
try to figure out what went hay
wire, and then turned over to a 
mushmouth P.R. guy whos on 
the way to see his girlfriend when
 well, you remember the last 
time Chucky got into a car. Hijack 
City. And before you know it, 
Chucky is hanging around the 
foster home, assassinating other 
dolls, hitching rides on the school 
bus so he can write obscenities on 
the teachers papers at Andys 
school, and murdering several 
adults who cant seem to figure it 
out.
The only two people who see 
Chucky for what he truly is  a 
maniac killer toyare little Andy 
and his teenage foster-sister. 
Remember when you were a kid, 
and you would get this sudden 
urge to rip the little doll-babys 
head off? Or maybe just see if the 
doll-babys head would come off? 
And youd get in trouble with your 
mother?

Solaris
Based on the novel by Polish science-fiction writer 
Stanislow Lem, this 1972 film is considered the Soviet 
reply to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Director Andrei 
Tarkovsky brought this complex tale to the screen, 
about Soviet psychologist Kris Kelvin who is sent on 
a mission to investigate the planet Solaris. Apparently 
several strange occurences have led commanders on 
Earth to believe that there is something wrong with 
the space station orbiting the planet, and Kelvin has 
been authorized to shut the station down after com
pleting his research.
When Kelvin arrives, he uncovers some eerie infor
mation about the life form on the planet and the 
maddening way in which it communicates. Ever since 
the planets surface was exposed to radiation by 
human scientists, the planet has been in a constant 
state of change, controlled by the being that lives 
there. Tarkovskys epic is complicated and surreal, 
but the images and message are beautifully dis
played. Solaris has been shown in the United States 
for the past fourteen years, but only recently has it 
been available in this uncut version.

Its A Wonderful Life
For many-people, watching Its A Wonderful Life is 
as important to the Christmas season as trimming an 
Evergreen or caroling through town. This Frank 
Capra classic pairs lovable Jimmy Stewart with the 
ultimate housewife, Donna Reed. They live with their 
three kids in a small town where everyone cowers 
under the tyranny of Mr. Potter. As George Bailey, 
Stewart is one of the last hopes against Potter, but 
when running the local bank has disastrous results, 
George finds himself on the verge of suicide, wishing 
he were never born. With the help of some divine 
intervention, an angel named Clarence who is trying 
to earn his wings, George gets to see how the people 
he loves would have lived without him.

Flatliners
Flatliners, in a way, has the same casting concept 
as Young Guns: Get great young actors and hype 
them up in the ads. But unlike Guns, the film is backed 
up with a solid, disturbing plot, featuring a sadistic 
life-after-death experiment developed by Nelson 
Wright (Kiefer Sutherland) that sends the cast mem
bers into a world where dream and reality are blurred 
into one. The camera work is impeccable and forms 
the chilling mood that permeates the movie, aiding it 
in its startling message about life after death  
whatever the message was.
The acting is as good as youd think, with these
new-generation heavyweights: Kiefer Sutherland
takes some great shots  not by a camera, but by
some deranged little brat whom he wronged in his
childhood. Alec Baldwin plays a bit part, although his
dreams are the most fun to watch. Kevin Bacon
plays a nice guy (yawn). And Julia Roberts even
; sleeps with someone. Cant beat that.

Total Recall
; Americas master thespian, Arnold Schwarz
enegger, returns to the DH 2210 screen in Total Recall. Arnie plays Quaid, a common man who finds 
: himself in a uncommon situation. Quaid goes to get a 
 vacation implanted in his memory (they can do that 
now), but things go awry and Quaid finds himself in 
j the cloak-and-dagger world of espionage. Or is it all a 
; dream?
The plot is pretty good, the special effects are really 
i well done, and the violence in this film is spectacular. 
J The high point is when Arnie uses a random 
pedestrians body as a shield against the bad guys 
bullets. Its typical Arnie.
All right, its not quite The Terminator, but Total 
; Recall is still worth a buck.
