Notorious Expert Tells 
Of Holidays Origin
by H. G. Warren Wilson
Most people know the significance of April Fools day, and not 
a few people (infact not any people) are aware of the origin of this 
traditional day of tomfoolery.
As this story is of little interest and great length, I shall relate
it here. If a few of the key points 
seems to be missing, I can only say 
in defense that I certainly am not 
one to sacrifice brevity for the 
sake of coherence.
Fools Gold 
My story beiijg with a particular 
Fool in 15th century Britain.
Sir Thomas Fool, then head of 
the Fool house, resided with his 
lovely wife Chlrophyllis in a city 
now known as Flushing-down-theDrain, England. This city was at 
that time simply called Flushingdown-the-Drain, England.
Tom Fool was the discoverer of 
a chemical process whereby he 
could manufacture a kind of gold 
from orange peels. This type of 
gold, named Fools gold in honor 
of its inventor, resembled natural 
gold in every respect except that 
it was less durable, which had the 
singular effect that people spent 
it faster than other gold, giving 
rise to the saying: A fool and his 
gold are soon parted.
Nobodies and Anybodies 
Chlorophyllis presented Thomas 
with twin sons, both of them boys. 
These twins, Anybodies and No
bodies, probably the greatest fools 
of all time, are the center of the 
story.
Nobodies Fool was a rather fool
ish lad who lacked either the in
telligence or ambition or both to 
take much of an interest in any
thing. But Anybodies Fool, the 
younger of the twins by 17 months, 
was not anybodys fool.
Nobodies Fool, by an odd quirk 
of fate, quadrupled the Fools for
tune during an amazing run of

CIT To Receive 
Carbide Grants
Extensive Scholarship 
Program Is Undertaken
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
is one of a limited number of lib
eral arts and technical colleges se
lected to receive undergraduate 
scholarships and grantsin-aid 
from the Union Carbide educa
tion fund.
Established by the Union Car
bide and Carbon corporation of 
New York, the undergraduate 
scholarships will cover the com
plete cost of tuition for a full fouryear academic course and also will 
provide reasonable allowances for 
necessary books and required fees. 
In addition to providing assistance 
to the students, each scholarship 
will carry an annual grant-in-aid 
of $600 for the college during the 
life of the scholarship.
400 Scholarships 
To initiate this program, Car
negie Tech along with the other 
participating schools will select a 
group of students from their 
freshman classes in addition to the 
assigned number of scholars from 
the Pittsburgh region who will be 
selected for entrance in Septem
ber. Under full operation, it is ex
pected t^iat the Union Carbide 
Scholarship program will cover 
about 400 scholarships at an esti
mated annual cost of approxi
mately $500,000.
Three-Fold Purpose 
The purpose of the Unin Car
bide scholarship program s three
fold: to assist deserving students 
who are interested in business 
careers to obtain a college educa
tion; to help assure the availability 
of larger numbers of men and 
women, trained in technical and 
non-technical colleges, for future 
executive and administrative 
careers in business and industry; 
and to encourage and give limited 
financial aid td a cross section of 
smaller American colleges and 
technical institutions of tradition
ally high standing.

McCarthy Committee Finds 
 Subversive Influences Here
Though the fact is virtually unknown to the student body and 
to most of the faculty, Carnegie Tech has, during the past week, been 
the scene of an extensive Congressional investigation. Conducted in 
the third sub-basement of Machinery hall, an inquisition under the
direction of Congressman Charles^----------------------------------------------------------------

To Visit Tech
Carnegie Tech is one of five universities and colleges selected by 
the US government to be surveyed 
by a team of French educators in 
connection with the exchange vis

state. Under this program, five 
French scholars will be at Tech on 
March 0, 31, and April 1 to study 
the plan of professional education 
now functioning in all Carnegie 
colleges. They will observe how 
this plan is implemented through 
instruction in the departments of 
architecture, home economics, me
chanical engineering, psychology 
and education, and science.
At the conclusion of their visit, 
the educators will return to 
France to direct the development 
of programs and methods in 
French national education, with 
the purpose of preparing profes

and as citizens.

Schunk: Since 1943.
McCarthy: At that time were 
you a member of the Communist 
Party?
Schunk: No.
McCarthy: Is it true that in the

Though Difficult, Henry IV 
Proves Good Meat For Dramats
Editors note: We present herewith the first comentary on a 
performance of the Carnegie Tech drama department to appear in 
modern times. It is not meant as a professional criticism, being writ
ten by a student of science rather than of the arts. But we hope 
nevertheless to present an account and evaluation of the plays 
from the lay-students viewpoint, and hence to establish more of 
a reader interest in the dramas staged herethan can be done by 
blunt notes telling briefly of a plays coming two weeks before the 
first performance, as has been the case in the past.
By Bob Dannels
The current drama department production, Shakespears Henry 
IV, is entertaining and enjoyable. The cast clearly demonstrates 
that difficulty need not be the reason for this play seldom being

the impression by convincing his 
father (and the audience) of his

Such oscillations are achieved 
several times during the ensuing

that Fools luck might run out, his

invest his winnings wisely.

Anybodies went on to study art 
and sculpture and after a time ac
quired no small repute as a master 
of portraits and busts. So fine

even today many of Fools names 
and Fools faces are often seen in

The End Is Near 
An unfortunate experience early 
in life had a devastating effect 
upon April Fool. It seems that 
upon being introduced to her, a 
young man extended his hand 
and said Pleased to meet you, 
Miss Fool, Ive heard so much 
about you. This brash familiarity 
created in her a permanent dis
trust toward the male sex, and 
at the age of 21 she entered a 
convent and was never heard of 
or heard from since that time.
From the meager available 
knowledge of her life, it is im
possible to discern why April 
Fools day was named after April 
Fool, or just how the tradition of 
committing pranks in her honor 
was begun. But it would be ridic
ulous to say that April Fools day 
is not named after April Fool. 
That would be comparable in ab
surdity to denying that Colum
bus day is named after Christo
pher Columbus or that Easter is 
named after Luke Easter.

More Testimony
Later in the day, Professor K. 
F. Gauss of the department of 
mathematics was called to the 
stand with the following results:
McCarthy: Were you a member 
of the Communist party in Octo
ber, 1948?
Gauss: No.
McCarthy: Then why did you
not stand for the national anthem 
at the Carnegie Tech-Bethany 
game during that year?
Gauss: I had the gout.
McCarthy: Then you do not 
deny having been a Communist 
since then.
Gauss: I did not say that.
McCarthy: But still yo do not 
deny it.
Gauss: Certainly I deny it.
McCarthy: Then perhaps you 
can explain the charges that you
have functioned irrationally to
ward your classes.
Gauss: If you mean I taught my 
classes the characteristics of irra
tional numbers, that is true.
McCarthy: Then you do not 
deny this?
Gauss: I cannot.
McCarthy: With all this' irra
tional behavior, you still persist to 
represent yourself as a loyal citi
zen?
Gauss: You do not understand
my meaning.
McCarthy: I think I understand 
only too well. Any professor cap
able of irrationalties in so precise 
a field as mathematics, is doubly 
capable of deviation in the polit
ical field.
Full information on the remain
der of the testimony and its results 
here will be published at a later 
date, after the committee has com
pleted its investigation.

THESE WINGS YOU CAN EARN OVER 
<5,000 A YEAR AFTER GRADUATION
Important facts about the opportunities for YOU 
as a Commissioned OfficerPilot or Aircraft Observer
in the United States Air Force

Where do I take my training?
Pre-flight training will be at Lackland Air Force Base, San 
Antonio, Texas. Primary, basic and advanced training will be 
taken at any one of the many Air Force bases located throughout 
the South and Southwest.
What happens if I flunk the training course?
Every effort is made to help students whose progress is unsatis
factory. You can expect extra instructions and whatever indi
vidual attention you may require. However, if you fail to 
complete the course as an Aviation Cadet, you will be required 
to serve a two-year enlistment to fulfill the minimum requirement 
under Selective Service laws. Veterans who have completed C 
tour of military service will be discharged upon request if they 
fail to complete the course.
What pay do I get as an Aviation Cadet? And after?
As an Aviation Cadet you draw $109.20 a month pay. In 
addition, you get summer and winter uniforms, flight clothes, 
equipment, food, housing, medical and dental care and insurance 
... all free. After you are commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant you 
will be earning $5,300.00 a yearwith unlimited opportunities 
for advancement.
Are all Aviation Cadets trained to be Pilots?
No. You can choose between becoming a Pilot or an Aircraft 
Observer. Men who choose the latter will become commissioned 
officers in Navigation, Bombardment, Radar Operation, or 
Aircraft Performance Engineering.
Do Aircraft Observers get flying trainingi, too?
Yes. Aircraft Observer Cadets receive approximately 200 hours 
of "in the air instructions. The primary phase of Aircraft 
Observer training is the same for all branches (navigation, 
bombardment, etc.). The basic and advanced phases of training 
vary, depending on the specific course you pursue.
What kind of airplanes will I fly?
You will fly jets. Tfye Pilot Cadet takes his first instructions in 
a light, civilian-type plane of approximately 100 horsepower, 
then graduates to the 600 horsepower T-6 "Texan before 
receiving transition training in jets. You then advance gradually 
until you are flying such famous first-line aircraft as F-86 Sabre, 
F-89 Scorpion, B-47 Stratojet, B-50 Superfortress. Observer 
Cadets take flight instructions in the C-47 Dakota, the T-29 
Convair, and the TB-50 Superfortress before advancing to firstline aircraft such as the F-89 Scorpion, B-47 Stratojet.
Will my commission be in the Regular Air Force or ReserveT
Aviation Cadet graduates, both Pilots and Aircraft Observer, 
get Reserve commissions as 2nd Lieutenants and become eligible 
to apply for a regular Air Force Commission when they have 
completed 18 months of active duty.
How long must I remain in Service?
After graduation from the Aviation Cadet Program, you an 
tendered an indefinite appointment in the United States T<i 
Force Reserve and are called to active duty with the United 
States Air Force for a period of three years.
What recreation and leisure time will I have as a Cadet?
Discipline will be rigidespecially for the first few weeks; 
However, i$ is not all work. Youll find swimming pools, handball' 
courts, movies and other forms of recreation on the post.
Where will I be stationed when I get my commission?
You may be stationed anywhere in the world ... Hawaii, Fat 
East, Europe, Puerto Rico, elsewhere. During your tour of duty, 
you will be in close touch with the latest developments in new 
flying techniques. You will continue to build up your flying 
experience and later should have no difficulty securing C GTT 
commercial pilot or navigator rating.
Your future is assured if you can qualify! Heres what to do:
/
Take a transcript of your college credits and a.copy of your birth certificate to your nearest 
Air Force Base or Recruiting Station. Fill out the application they give you.2 If application is accepted, the Air Force will arrange for you to take a physical 
examination at government expense.
3 Next, you will be given a written aiyl manual aptitude test.4 If you pass your physical and other tests, you will be scheduled for an 
Aviation Cadet training class. The Selective Service Act allows you 
a four-month deferment while waiting class assignment.

Editor, the Tartan:
In your article on the Scotch and Soda-TV 
question on March 10, 1953 you refer to the Drama 
Departments notorious ban on drama students 
participating in the Clubs productions; this is a 
complete misrepresentation of the letter, a copy of 
which I inclose. If you are interested in truth 
rather than propaganda, your conscience will com

Yours truly,

Mr. David Clark
President, Scotch and Soda Club 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
Pittsburgh 13. Pennsylvania 
Dear Sir: >
The faculty of the Department of Drama has 
discussed at some length the relationship of the 
department to the Scotch and Soda Club. The 
occasion of the discussion has been the realization 
on the part of the faculty that the entire work of 
the department for the past several years has been 
completely disrupted by Scotch and Soda; and 
despite such efforts on the part of the faculty as 
well as the members of the Scotch and Soda Club 
to remedy this situation, it has become progress
ively worse instead of better.
Therefore, the faculty of the Department of 
Drama has made the following decisions:
1. A member of the drama faculty will no 
longer direct the Scotch and Soda produc
tion.
2. No freshman will be permitted to partici
pate in the Scotch and Soda production. The 
reason for this decision is that during the 
time Scotch and Soda is in preparation, the 
freshmen are working intensively on their 
own full-length plays which are the summa
tion of the years work; and participation in 
Scotch and Soda has in most instances a 
ruinous effect on this work.
3. Neither the shops nor departmental equip
ment may be used in preparing the produc
tion.
4. Academic credit will not be granted for par
ticipation in Scotch and Soda either as actors 
or as crew. Such drama students as par
ticipate in Scotch and Soda must do it on 
the same basis as do students in/ other de
partmentsas an extra-curricular activity.
5. Students may not be cast in a major produc
tion afid Scotch and Soda simultaneously. 
If a student has been cast in Scotch and 
Soda earlier in the semester and it is nec
essary to cast him in a departmental pro
duction, he will be required to drop from 
the Scotch and Soda cast.
These decision have been reached by the fac
ulty of the Department of Drama regretfully and 
Only after careful deliberation.
Yours very truly,
Henry Boettcher.

In the best interests of the Scotch and Soda 
Club and the Drama Department, I feel compelled 
to write to you concerning your article, in the 
March 10 issue of The Tartan, on the Scotch and 
Soda-TV Question.
Im afraid your wording, notorious ban by the , 
Drama Department, was incorrect. There has 
been a representation from the Drama Depart
ment in the last two Scotch and Soda productions.
I hope that you will publish this letter with 
the accompanying list so that this point may be 
cori-ected in the minds of the Student Body, the 
Faculty, and the Administratiorf.

Editorial2Q
Wheres The Coach?
One obvious fault of the Scotch n Soda structure has 
popped up during the television ruckus that has been going 
on for the last few weeks. While the Kiltie band, Cameron 
choir, and all athletics have a coach who is a representative 
of the school rather than the student body, Scotch n Soda 
has none and Was consequently at a loss for representation in 
the recent TV hearing. In the period before the War and 
immediately afterwards when mass participation of the 
dramats was allowed, the need for a director was not quite 
so obvious since the students of the theater have a much bet
ter insight into the problems of directing a large production 
and officials of the drama department handled all relation
ships with the school.
If the Kiltie Band had been in a similar situation coming 
to a head before one of the faculty advisory committees, the 
director would have been there to carry the case, and his opinion 
would have been fully accepted.
But such was not the case for SnS. Not one person was 
present at the faculty-committee meeting who knew the com
plexities of the Clubs operation. One person did make a few 
statements which should have been slightly clarified by 
someone in the know before they were accepted. Not one 
mention was made throughout the discussi6n on the effect 
which the staging of a review would have over the staging 
of a book show.
Some have argued that when an activity is under the com
mand of a faculty director, many of the students lose the privi
lege of administering the activity. Really, the only duties that 
the student members would be deprived of are those involving 
the detailed relationships with the administration. This is the 
field where student results have been poor, mainly because the 
turnover in students is so fast that no one person has a chance 
to obtain a complete understanding of the varied problems before 
his term is finished. A permanent faculty director would hold 
the position for enough years so that he could develop a basic 
understanding of Scotch n Soda. Such a person would naturally 
command more respect from those in the high positions.
There is no need for this job to be a full time task, for 
Scotch n Soda could not afford this; but it should be possible 
to find one professor over the Fine Arts college who has 
enough interest in SnS or musical comedies (or just plain 
working with student outside of the academic influences) to 
take over the positionr Such a man could insure that nothing 
was being done to ruin Techs reputation* and just keep 
things in line. There was an incident last year when some
thing popped up in the script the night of dress rehearsal 
(the first time that anyone outside of the student sphere has 
witnessed the performance) that was a little distressing to 
the faculty present. But, it was too late to change the script; 
but a little advi* earlier would have been heeded and ap
preciated.
Editors Note: While the choice of the word 
'ban may have been pooras supported by Mr. 
Adlers letterthe idea of a ban is still correct. 
Since the letter to SnS in 1949, the caliber of 
Scotch n Soda has slowly slipped, because a mass 
participation of drama students was no longer jf 
possible. While this was in the best interests of the 
principles of Scotch n Soda, since it encouraged 
students from other departments to participate, 
this chance in policy has been noticeable in the 
subsequent productions. Therefore, the article 
should have been worded the ban on mass parti
cipation by drama students
However, neither one of the preceeding letters 
have mentioned the crux of the argument. The 
point that is still hanging in doubt throughout the 
campus is Why the ban? Both Mr. Boettcher and ^ 
Mr. Adler have nicely avoided the present day is
sue. Mr. Boettcher could have shed some light on 
the TV question since he was instrumental in 
affecting the banbut he chose instead to direct 
our attention back 4 years. Maybe his conscience* 
compelled him to avoid the issue.
Dormitories
Editor, the Tartan:
While some of your editorials concerning the 0) 
barracks were slightly exaggerated, in general your 
seeming interest in dormitory matters is appre
ciated.
In connection with the article on vandalism in , 
the dormitories, I would like to tell your readers 
I that a partial solution to the problem is possible. 
The solution is to' let the dorm residents know 
what is wrong. This way, each of them can in
fluence his fellows to walk the straight and nar
row.
A recent dormitory meeting which was well atv. 
tended presented to these residents the various 
offenses which have been committed in the past 
year. Such a meeting should have been called 
sooner but even late' it served its purpose very 
well. A few persons who were not able to eomprehend the moral aspects of right and wrong were 
more able to see the situation from a dollars and 
cents viewpoint. Possible loss of the few advantages 
that dorm students have also impressed a few. 
The improvement in conduct has been quite no
ticeable. We hope that it wont be temporary/
I might also mention that all of the damages 
and thefts are not necessarily due to dorm resi
dents. Many outsiders, known and unknown, visit 
the dormitories. Only, God, the culprits, and pos
sibly a few investigating the situation know who
dunit.
Keep up your concern over our lot and when 
your interest becomes too noticeably editorial, 
well let you know.
Sincerely,'
Bob Robl,
. McGill Hall .
Erratum
Due to circumstances beyond our control, to
day is the first of April. At a consequence, several 
untoward things have happened to the Tartans 
makeup and content this week. We therefore ad
vise that some of the contents of this issue be taken 
with the proverbial grain of salt.
It would be far to much trouble, however, to 
enumerate here which items are serious, and which 
are not, so make your own choices.

Tartans Slip By Penn State To 
Win 33 rd Straight Title
by Jim Gore
With an amazing display of brain power and finger dexterity 
the CIT poker team out-thought and out-maneuvered their op
ponents from Penn State to capture the Intercollegiate Poker-playing 
crown for the thirty-third straight year.
The victory in the final game,#-----------------------------------------------------------------
witnessed by nigh onto 20,000 (us
ing field glasses) culminated a 
great effort by our four cardhappy representatives. Team cap
tain Ace Inthehole expressed 
the sentiments of the team when 
he commented to this reporter 
following the final hand Phew 
time for a beer.
In the match play preceeding 
thespectacular finale the Scots 
speedily took Pitt, Ohio State, 
Geneva, and Lehigh foii all they 
were worth. However the Penn 
State match was a hard fought 
one.
Ivan Deuces Wild Dropski 
cheated his way to a 500 dollar 
win over Penn States Innocence 
ORiley whereby Tech immediate
ly had an advantage in the bestof-seven final. The Plaid also seiz
ed the next two contests, raking 
in a considerable sum in doing so, 
as Jack Diamond and King 
Shovel, with the aid of three ex
tra aces, proceeded to tromp their 
opponents.
However the fourth game, which 
decided the championship in 
Techs favor was a humdinger. 
Our boy Ace got off to a bad start 
because the judges wouldnt al
low him to use his own cards and 
it looked for a while as if he 
would lose his whole bankroll, 5 
Gs. Lady Luck -smiled however 
and when, one of the judges turn
ed his back to get his glass refilled, 
Ace slipped a Tech deck into 
play.
With breath-taking suspense the 
game progressed until at a quarter
to five in the morning both men 
were staking all their holdings on 
one hand. The Penn Stater, Sam
my Playclean, dealt himself a royal 
flush in a cold hand, which is 
quite a feat for even a pro. Ace 
found himself holding three treys 
and a pair of queens. .There was 
only one thing to do so Ace did it.
Coughing vigorously he went for 
his handkerchief and having been 
called he put the five aces, which 
hankie contained, on the ta
ble. Taking advantage of his op
ponents surprise he swept the win
nings up and trotted off to receive 
the cherished Golden Chip, that 
goes to the victorious team.

Past Field In Binghamton Meet
Carnegie Tech won the 1953 Eastern Volleyball Tournament 
held at Binghamton, N.Y., on March 20 and 21 by compiling the best 
record in round robin play.
The tourney was so set up that each team played every op
ponent twice. The Tartans com-*------------~------------------------------ 
a 13 and one record in the 
t team affair to win the tro
phy. Oswega State finished run
ner-up, winning 12 while losing 
two.
Lose First Game
After completing their 350 mile 
trip, the Tartans were thrown in 
their match against an erstwhile 
contender, Oswego State. They lost 
8-6, and proceeded to win their 
next 13 matches, upending Oswego 
State 8-6, Colgate 8-2, 8-0, Wilkes 
college 8-5, 8-3, Cornell 8-4, 8-3, 
Scranton A 8-0, 8-1, Brockport 
State 8-2, 8-1, and Scranton B 
8-0, 8-1. They also beat Bingham
ton State 8-2, 8-4, but these two 
matches were, not counted because 
Binghamton was disqualified.
Representatives of the Plaid 
Members of the winning Tech 
team are Kay Thompson, George 
Bushy, Ed Possessky, Frank Feg
ley, Jack Hoover, George Berringer, George Thomas, Bill Boney, 
and Ed Puchy. Ed Possessky serv
ed as team captain. Earl Birdy is 
the coach. The standings of the 
competing teams was as follows:

A Challenge To Compete
At first, pessimistic coach Birdy 
refused to commit his Tartans 
against this type of opposition, but 
after a series of challenges he con
sented, seeking to give the boys 
some experience.
Tech drew Oswego State in the 
opening round and eliminated 
them 15-7, 15-7. They then sent 
Cooper Union back to New York 
city after a 15-11, 9-12, 15-3 tri
umph. Prior to this tiff, the con
fident Cooper Union team captain 
was quoted as saying these boys 
(Carnegie Tech) might even give 
us a battle.
Upset Hometowners 
The crowning blow came when 
the Tartans upset the hometown 
New York State Tech sextet, 10- 
12, 17-15, 13-9. Tech lost the lirst 
game and had to come from be
hind in the second to take the 
match.
Bow To National Champs
The Tartans finally bowed out 
in the championship game, but to 
a worthy foe, Springfield college, 
the national champions eked out 
Tech 15-10, 14-12.
All Tournament Team 
Tech was awarded a second 
place trophy for their efforts and 
Bushey, Thompson, and Boney 
were selected on the all-tourna

Third Victory
Before a large Intramural night crowd the Rockets soared off 
to an early lead and convincingly trounced a fighting ATO team 
J7-38 to win the school basketball championship. . Shooting with 
amazing accuracy, the Rocket team established a 13-5 lead by the 
end of the first quarter. The fine* 
shooting of Marv Verman and the 
aggressive rebounding of Jim Hunt 
and Chet Kolar extended that lead 
to 30-12 at half time.
Fine Outside Shooting 
Defensively the ATOs game was 
broken up by the accurate shoot
ing from the outside by the Rock
ets. In an attempt to limit the in
side shooting of Jim Miller and 
Bob Duffus, The Rockets set up a 
one ^defense, switching to a man 
to man when the ball went close 
to the basket.
In the second half the ATO team 
was forced to press in order to at
tempt to overcome the Rocket 
lead. On the other hand, the Rock
ets played a slow, sure game rely
ing on their lead to carry them 
thru. Such a type of play resulted 
in the ATOs being called for many 
fouls. It was quickly evident that 
the Rockets were managing to 
maintain their lead by matching 
ATOs field goals with their own 
foul shots. During this brief flurry 
of fouls, Miller, Adams, and Ma
jor accumulated four fouls apiece
which hindered their play.

WAA By 13-16
In a battle of the sexes the IM 
board firmly established the su
periority of the males by beating 
the WAA at their own game, girls 
basketball, 16-13. The first half 
was played under regular girls 
rules while the second half saw 
the board donning boxing gloves 
as a compensating handicap.
It was a spirited game with both 
teams showing lots of fight, even 
though the boys possessed the 
gloves. The mere fact that the girls 
did not have the gloves did not 
stop them from firmly hitting the 
boys on several occasions.
 Box Score
Coach Cecil Alexanders hard 
fighting wrestling team, currently 
sporting a 2-3 record, is hoping to 
defeat the Pitt intramural cham
pions next Wednesday, and thus 
finish at .500.
Techs fine showing in her last 
three matches give good reason 
for optimism next Wednesday. 
Despite injuries and weight dis
advantage, Carnegie edged out a 
close victory at Shadyside 17-15, 
and then racked up the downtown 
Y 17-3. The team then journeyed 
to the Pitt fieldhouse to give its 
best performance of the year, al
though losing to the Pitt freshmen 
22-5.
Sole Score
The score isnt indicative of 
Techs showing, since Pitts fresh
men are capable of beating most 
eastern college varsities, and give 
their own varsity (second only to 
Penn State) a good battle. Techs 
five points came when Jack Delbrook pinned his opponent in two 
minutes, scarcely after the bout 
had started, with the same quarter-nelson he used 20 seconds be
fore while getting the takedown.
Pitt took a 10-0 lead with falls 
in the first two bouts, and then 
made it 13-0 with Barrone decisioning Brussalis before Delbrooks 
victory put the Plaid back in the 
match.

Bevo Tallies 37;BTO 
Wins City Tiddley Cup
By Ted Reuther
Last night, before a capacity crowd of 15,000 humans in the 
ultra-modern Carnegie Tech field house, little Guglielmos own 
Beta Theta Omega fraternity (representing Carnegie Tech) completely outclassed all opposition to 
winks tourney. <
The BTO championship intra
mural team, paced by Bevo 
(Frankie), who tallied 37 points, 
brought the greatly coverted Tid
dley cup back to CIT after 15 
years at Pitt. Play in square spar
row elimination tourney began, as 
everyone expected. (This is the 
usi|^l procedure in athletic events 
in fact it is usually the proced
ure in all events.)
Editors Note: In case the read
er is not familiar with the game 
tiddley winks, it is played as fol
lows: In a manner similar to foot
ball, basketball, etc. Action begins 
in the first canto; proceeds to the 
second stanza; after which follows 
the third frame; with competition 
finally ending in the fourth and 
final checker. \
Bevo Outscores Cricketts 
Bevo gave the Tartans an early 
lead by tipping three in the high 
scoring five point cup. This cup is 
surrounded by four one point 
cups. Coasting on this lead, the 
Scotties matched the Panthers of 
Pit point for point; however, Dukane, led by all-district Ricardo 
Cricketts (just what district is not 
known) gave quite a scare to 
Tech.
Tartans Filled With Scotch 
The slight shock filled the Tarcop the greater Pittsburgh tiddley -
tan tiddley-winksteers (analogous 
to basketeers) with a true Scotch 
spirit and they went on to take 
number one spot. Dukane follow
ed to cop second, while Pit copped 
(one of sportwriters many over
used words) third place.
Leading Scorers
Six-four Larry Settle, PiKA, led 
the intramural scoring parade this 
year with 169 points. He was fol
lowed by Frank Fegley and Jack 
Kane of Beta Theta Pi, and Dick 
Dick of the Obelisks. Playoff

by Jack Alexander
Actually, you slip it on, because the 
weaker sex has a strong yen for the 
man in a Manhattan stpeMlkn sportshirt. This good-looking gabardine 
is deftly tailored  styled as only 
Manhattan can style it with pickstitching on collar and pockets. 
Available in a wide range of smart 
colors, equally handsome with or 
without a tie.
POOR PAUL felt down under when his girl aid, "Your sloppy hair kangaruin* 
our friendship. Never pouch your arms around me again until you high tail it to 
a toilet goods counter for some Wildroot Cream-Oil. Contains Lanolin. Nonalcholic. Relieve* annoying dryness. Removes loose, ugly 
dandruff. Grooms the hair. Helps you pass the Finger-Nail 
Test. Get it or youll kangaroo the day! Sheedy tried Wildroot 
Cream-Oil and now all the girls are hopped up about him.
Better reach in your pocket for 29? and buy Wildroot CreamOil in either bottle or tube. You kangaiong cause it puts real 
punch into your social life. Ask for it on your hair at any 
barber shop too, and get a jump ahead of all the othlr guys!

basic construction, an unbeliev

provides a range from throne
bit too hard in this portrayal. 
When the climatic duel between 
Hotspur and Prince Henry is over^ 
the audience should feel a larger 
sense of loss than it does.
Gerald TerJheyden as the flexi

audience by acquainting them 
with one of the bards most cap

role of the comedian is probably 
easier to portray than the heavj

Effective Illusions
The pliancy of the staging is to
room to barroom and robbery hill 
to plains of battle. Yet all manage 
to provide sufficient foundation
for imagination to readily fill any 
small gaps. The costumes, sound, 
and light!rg contribute^ by well
providing the required illusions 
and effects to make this a success
ful production.
