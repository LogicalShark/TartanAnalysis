Problems in motion involving vari
able acceleration may often be easily 
solved by graphical means. This is 
especially true in those causes in 
which the variation in acceleration 
does not follow any simple law.
Before taking up the scheme by 
which these solutions may be obtained 
and the examples to illustrate it the 
following fundamental definitions are 
given.
Position: Location of a body rela
tive to some point considered fixed. 
Three dimensions are necessary to lo
cate a body correctly. When a body, 
in all of its positions considered, is in 
the same plane two dimensions may 
be sufficient.
Motion: Change of position.
Path: Successive positions which a 
body occupies during its motion. If 
the path of a moving body is a straight 
line, the direction of motion is uni
form; if the path is curved or irregu
lar the direction of motion is variable. 
The direction of motion at a given 
point is tangent to the path at that 
point.
Space Traversed: Distance a body
travels, shown by the length of the 
path, usually considered as the dis
tance a body travels between two 
stated periods of time.
Velocity: Time rate of motion;
time rate of change of position. Since 
motion involves direction, velocity 
therefore has direction as well as 
quantity.
Uniform Velocity: That motion in
which the rate of change of position 
is a constant quantity; i. e., the ratio

REVIEWS.
President Cyrus Northrop of the 
University of Minnesota, recently 
sajd: I am an advocate of foot-ball, 
and I fail to see anything in trained 
skill, speed, strength and science that 
precludes gentlemen. At Minnesota... 
we have experienced trainers, and as 
a result few if any Minnesota men 
have felt bad results that follow when 
men are not trained for such contests. 
1 believe the game is manly and de
velops gentlemen rather than that it 
works against the principles of what 
should be considered manhood by 
every gentleman, and moreover, I be
lieve the game is here to stay. It is 
being purged year by year, getting 
cleaner and freer from objectionable

The members of the middle class of 
apprentices to the machinery trades 
are at work and with much interest 
and enthusiasm, on the construction 
of three 12-inch swing, speed lathes. 
The machines were designed and the 
drawings made, under the supervision 
of Mr. Leeds of the Industrial School, 
who is greatly pleased with the pro
gress of the work. The main castings, 
made by the students, are complete, 
and are on exhibition in the machine 
shop. All parts will be made by the 
apprentices who are intent upon turn
ing out a strictly Carnegie Tech pro
duct.
An excellent opportunity is here af
forded the men to observe methods 
during the various periods of construc
tion. The machinist will have a 
chance to watch the pattern-maker 
building the pattern, and in turn ob
serve the process of molding, casting 
and machining. Inscriptions with the 
names and class of the builders will 
be placed on the lathes that these stu
dents may have the signal honor of 
being the first to have built a machine 
at the Carnegie Technical Schools.

with its corresponding time must be 
considered, the smaller this change of

Tn Figure 1 the space-time curve 
shows the amount of space traversed
by a moving body during various in
tervals of time. The vertical heights 
on the diagram represent space in 
feet -according to the given scale and 
in the first second, sixteen feet in two 
seconds, twenty-four feet in three sec
onds, etc. The rate of this motion or 
the velocity is eight feet divided by 
one second or eight feet per second; 
sixteen feet divided by two seconds 
or eight feet per second; twenty-four 
feet divided by three seconds or eight 
per second, etc. The velocity is there
fore a uniform one of eight feet per 
second.
By taking a portion of this line as 
the hypotenuse of a right triangle of 
which vertical and horizontal lines 
are the legs, the slope of the curve 
may be measured by the ratio of the 
vertical side to the horizontal side; i. 
e., in the triangle ABD the ratio of 
BD to AD is a measure of the slope 
of the line AB or the tangent of the 
angle C03; in the triangle OC3 the 
the horizontal distances mark increas
ing intervals of time. According to 
the curve, the body travels eight feet 
slope of AB is measured by the ratio 
of C3 to 03 which is equal to the ratio 
of BD to AD. According to our scale 
BD is eight feet and AD is one sec
ond. The ratio of BD to AD is there
fore eight feet per second or the ve
locity of the body. The ratio of the 
vertical height C3 to base 03 is also 
eight feet per second. The slope of 
the space-time curve is therefore a 
measure of the velocity of the body. 
Since the curve is a straight line in 
this case the velocity is uniform.
The velccity-time curve has been 
plotted on the same diagram with the 
space-time curve, to a different scaltf; 
however, as will be seen on the left 
hand margin.
The space traversed by a moving 
body is equal to the average velocity 
multiplied by the time. The average 
velocity of course is the average for 
only the interval of time considered. 
The average velocity in this case is 
eight feet per second.
The space covered in eight seconds 
is eight feet per second times eight 
seconds or sixty-four feet. The area 
under the velocity curve, or that area 
bounded by the velocity curve the 
base line and the two vertical lines 
at the beginning and end of the eight 
seconds, is proportional to the space 
covered.

To recapitulate; the slope of the 
space-time curve is proportional to the 
velocity; the slope of the velocity 
curve is proportional to the accelera
tion; the area under the velocity 
curve is proportional to the space 
traversed; the average height of the 
figur underneath the velocity curve is 
the average velocity equal to the 
area of the figure divided by the 
length. These curves also show at a 
glance the maximum and minimum 
values of these quantities.
In the design of machine parts it 
is necessary to know the maximum 
accleration which these parts attain 
so that the loads to which they are 
subjected may be calculated and the 
parts made sufficiently strong to with
stand these loads.
figure 5 shows the mechanism re
quired to operate the. inlet valve on a 
gas engine. The cam shaft is turned 
by the main shaft at 75 revolutions 
per minute. The cam, by the mechan
ism shown, opens the valve to its
//r. Sec#^5
tains a velocity of forty feet per sec. 
The area under the velocity curve 
is the triangle ODC one half the 
height of which is the average ve
locity (CB).
The base (OC=8 sec.) times onehalf the altitude (CB=20 ft. per sec.) 
is equal to the area (160 feet) or the 
space traversed by the moving body 
in the first eight seconds of its travel.
The increase in velocity as shown 
by the curve is five feet per second 
in one second, ten feet per second in 
two seconds, fifteen feet per second in 
three seconds, etc. The time rate of 
change of velocity or acceleration is 
therefore five feet per second divided 
by one second or fifteen feet per sec
ond. In this case the ratio is a meas
ure of the slope of the cuive or the 
slope of the velocity curve is a meas
ure of the acceleration.
The slope is uniform, hence the 
acceleration is uniform. The accelera
tion curve is shown on the same 
chart to another scale.
Figure 3 is similar to the preceding 
except that the body does not start 
from rest but has an initial velocity 
of 20 feet, per second. The accelera
tion is five feet per second per second 
as before. The area under the velocity 
curve is proportionalto the space 
traversed by the body.
Suppose that a bodys distance from 
some point considered fixed be shown 
at known periods of time or suppose 
that the body as it moves be caused 
by proper mechanism to draw this 
curve. Let the space curve shown in 
Figure 4 be this curve. To find the 
velocity of the body at the different 
times the slope of the space curve 
must be measured. Suppose that 
the velocity at the fourth second be 
desired. Where the space curve 
crosses the four second line at A 
draw a tangent to the space curve. 
The slope of this tangent is also the 
slope of the curve at the point A. 
The slope of the tangent is equal to 
B'D' (40 ft.) divided by C'D' (7 sec. 
2 sec.=5 sec.) or 8 ft. per sec.
In a similar way the velocities at 
other points along the curve were 
found and plotted. The velocity curve 
thus found is one of uniform slope 
showing that, the acceleration is uni

greatest extent as it turns through an 
angle of 60 or in 2-15 sec. and closes 
the valve in an equal interval of time.
The profile of the cam is shown in 
detail with the cam follower, a short 
cylinder of G inches diameter, which 
rolls on the face of the cam. The 
angle of 60 on the cam through which 
the valve is being opened is divided 
into twelve parts each part represent
ing 1-90 sec. of time. The position of 
the center of the follower is plotted 
for various positions on the face of 
the cam and from this curve the dis
placement of the cam follower for 
various positions of the cam is obtain
ed.
This data is used in plotting the 
flat space-time curve shown above. 
The speed-time curve is obtained from 
this by the same means as described 
for Figure 4. The slope of the speed 
time curve is a measure of the ac
celeration, and by drawing tangents to 
the speed curve and finding their slope

the acceleration curve may be drawn. 
The tangent drawn at the crest of the 
speed curve is horizontal and has zero 
slope. The acceleration at this point 
is therefor zero. The speed has in
creased up to this point but begins to 
decrease, leaching a zero value when
locity is zero and a zero value when 
the velocity is greatest.
The greatest acceleration in this ex
ample is Been by the curve to be 27

H. LELAND LOWE, 
Instructor Dept Physics.
There is considerable discussion 
between engineers interested in the 
foundry business, as to which is the 
best method for making steel. Steel 
castings at present are made by one 
of three processes,the open-hearth, 
converter, and crucible methods. 
The latter we need not discuss, as it 
is altogether too costly, thus leaving 
the decision lying between the other 
two.
To one not interested in the produc
tion or sale of machinery and appli
ances used in either of the processes, 
the question naturally shapes itself 
into certain, quite well defined points: 
What sized castings are you to make, 
have you a ready market for your 
product, and what is your available 
capital for installation? The majority 
of engineers seem to prefer the con
verter process for small castings, es
pecially where the output will fluctu
ate considerably, but favor the openhearth if castings are heavy and the 
output regular. In the matter of in
stallation cost, the converter has 
much the better of it, being about 
three times as cheap.
We will suppose you are going to 
manufacture small castings, and that 
you will have to establish your own 
trade. In that case, there appears to 
be no doubt but that the small con
verter is the process to be chosen. 
After arriving at that conclusion, your 
next question to be settled will be as 
to the type of converter for you to 
install.
In the manufacture of small or me
dium sized steel castings certain es
sential features must be observed, 
regularity of output, rapidity of work
ing, variety of grades of metal, fluidity 
of metal, and a considerale range in 
the size of the castings. Close study 
of the various types of converters 
leads one to consider the Tropenas 
as being best able to meet these sev
eral requirements.
The Tropenas steel process has 
been the subject of considerable dis
cussion the last few years, 011 account 
of its growing popularity, and the 
fact that two United States Govern
ment Arsenals have adopted it with 
the result of raising the general stan
dard of specification of steel castings. 
The process consists of a special con
verter, in which iron, melted in a 
cupola beforehand, is converted into

---------------------------------------------------

steel. This vessel, like all other con
verters, is a sheet steel shell lined 
with silica brick or ganister. The 
shell is fitted with two hollow trunions, 
carried on pedestals, so that the ap
paratus may be tilted according to 
the requirements of the operation, i. 
e., charging the molten metal, pouring 
the steel, etc. The inside of the con
verter is so made that the metallic 
bath has a much greater depth than 
in any of the other pneumatic pro
cesses. The blast enters the convert
er from a pressure blower through the 
trunion feeding the wind boxes and 
tuyeres, which direct it over the me
tallic bath. The pressure and vol
ume of air are regulated by suitable 
valves.
Before commencing operation, the 
converter is heated by means of coke, 
crude oil, or gas; afterwards no fur
ther fuel is needed, for heat is sup
plied by burning the metalloids in the 
iron as they are being eliminated. 
The pig-iron and steel scrap having 
been melted in a cupola or other fur
nace, are run into the converter. It 
is. usual to remelt all the steel scrap 
arising from the castings; pig-scrap, 
the latter up to 60%, according to lo
cal and other conditions. The posi
tion of the converter, relative to the 
level of the metal, is then adjusted 
so as to have the proper conditions 
for blowing. The blast is started and, 
at a certain period of the operation, 
supplementary blast is introduced, at 
will, by means of auxiliary tuyeres. 
This completes the combustion of the 
escaping gases (which are allowed to 
go free in the Bessemer converter), 
raising the temperature of the bath by 
radiation. At the end of the operation 
a bath of very fluid and soft metal, 
freed from impurities, is the result, 
and recarburization is made in the ves
sel or in the ladle as in other steel 
processes.
The blast pressure is very low, not 
exceeding four pounds per square 
inch, and the volume is varied accord
ing to the kind of pig iron treated. 
The blast may be produced by either 
a positive pressure, rotary blower, or 
a blowing engine.
The characteristic features of the 
Tropenas converter can be summed 
up as follows:
1st. Low pressure blast, directed 
over the sui'faee of the metal.
2d. Special placing of the tuyeres 
in a horizontal plane so as to avoid
THE TARTAN
any whirling or tumultuous motion.
3d. A sufficient depth of metal so 
as to avoid churning and stirring dur
ing the operation, resulting in a steel 
free from occluded gases, and, there
fore, pours quietly into the molds, 
producing castings free from blow
holes.
4th. Use and arrangement of sup
plementary tuyeres, thus producing a 
more complete combustion of the es
caping gases, and giving, as a result, 
a steel of a higher temperature than 
that turned out by any other known 
process.
The fluidity makes the subsequent 
manipulation of the steel in pouring, 
etc., much easier and more satisfactory. 
As many as 420 castings have been 
poured from 100 pounds of steel with 
a bull ladle, holding about 110 pounds. 
Fluidity also insures the certainty of 
the metal filling the most delicate sec
tions of a mold so that the casting 
will be true to pattern in every re
spect. The heat of the metal is such 
that additions of cold metal up to 10% 
may be added in the ladle, and still 
leave the metal in proper condition to 
cast satisfactorily. In steels treated 
with nickel, chromium, tungsten or 
other alloys, as high as 10%, and more, 
can be added cold, and, if melted, there 
is no limit to the percentage that can 
be added for special metals. Steels of 
as many as ten different compositions 
have been made with this process 
from one charge by treatment in la
dles.
The foundry equipment is the same 
as that for the ordinary steel casting 
plant, it only being necessary to have 
the facilities for handling the metal 
and castings quickly and cheaply.
There is no process known which 
makes dynamo and general electric 
castings so satisfactorily. With it, it 
is very easy to make such castings 
with the closest regularity. The 
chemical analysis of this steel is ap
proximately: Silicon, 0.02%; man
ganese, Trace; carbon, 0.09; sulphur 
and phosphorus, according to the 
quality of the raw materials; the to
tal iron being from 99.70 to 99.80%; 
that is to say, it is practically wrought 
iron, free from slag. There seems to 
be a great field before this process for 
all purposes, especialjy in the manu
facture of specialties, for which it is 
particularly w^ell adapted.
The usual commercial product is a 
genuine high-grade steel of composi
S
tion identical with the best openhearth steel, high in tensile strength 
and ductility, having from 60,000 
to 80,000 pounds per square inch ten
sile strength, with an elongation of 
from 25 to 35% on two inches. The 
bending test is from 90 to 180. It 
is capable of being run into the light
est and most intricate shapes, is per
fectly round and free from blow-holes, 
and can be welded.
In regard to production it may be 
said that a plant consisting of one 
converter of two tons capacity, and 
blowing every day, making the neces
sary repairs to the l,-ning at the weeks 
end, can make about six blows a day. 
For two or three days it would be pos
sible to make ten or twelve blows a 
day. If such a quantity is required, 
it is much better to have two or three 
converters, as it is then possible to 
run two converters at the same time 
and have one always under repair. 
With three converters an output of 600 
tons per month of finished castings 
is easily attainable.
For the wide-awake technical grad
uate with a taste for foundry work, 
there appears to be scarcely a field in 
which so many opportunities have 
been sown awaiting the proper tillage 
and consequent harvest, as the steel 
casting business, and it is to be hoped 
that, with the excellent chances of
fered by both the Carnegie Technical 
Schools and its position in the center 
of the iron and steel industry many 
of its graduates will find therein a 
useful and lucrative position in the 
industrial world.

REVIEWS.
The hydraulic method of compress
ing air is not new, but the installation 
of a particularly large plant at the 
Victoria mine, in northern Michigan, 
has directed attention to it at this 
time. The method is thus described 
in The Scientific American (New 
York, March 16):
Instead of using turbine'te, as is 
usually done, to convert the hydraulic 
into mechanical power, and then using 
compressors to transform the mechan
ical into pneumatic power, in this sys
tem the air is comprest directly by the 
water, and without any intermediate 
mechanism. The action is similar to 
that of the aspirator-pump, in which, 
as is well known, a current of water 
acts by adhesion to exhaust the air 
from a receptacle. In the present 
case the reverse takes place, for bub
bles of air are taken from the free at
mosphere and then trapt in a cham
ber.
In the plant noted above, which con
tains some novel features, the power 
of the Ontonagon River is used to 
compress air, with which the machin
ery and tools of the mine and a mill 
are operated. The water sinks, 
through shafts cut in the solid rock, 
to a subterranean chamber, where the
air is collected under pressure. The 
air is fed through a series of 1,800 
radialtubes three-eighths of an inch 
in diameter, at each intake, from 
which the flowing water sucks the air 
in the form of bubbles. To quote 
again:
At the bottom of the shaft the in
take pipe is somewhat flared, and ex
tends about 15 inches below the nor
mal working level of the wrater in the 
chamber. Directly below each pipe 
is a conical concrete block. The 
water striking this block is spread 
out in an annular stream, thus deliv
ering the air bubbles near the surface 
of the water. During the compara
tively slow passage through the cham
ber, the air bubbles, owing to their 
buoyancy, rise out of the water and 
are trapt, because the water-level in 
the chamber is 18 inches above the 
roof of the outlet tunnel. The water, 
however, continues out through the 
tunnel and up the inclined shaft, 
whence it discharges into the tail-race.
The compression-chamber above 
the normal level of the water therein 
has a capacity of 80,264 cubic feet. A 
24-inch pipe conducts the air to the 
various pneumatic machinery used in 
the mine.
To prevent excess of compression, 
two blow-off pipes are provided, which 
operate when the water is forced be
low" certain levels in the compressionchamber. When the larger of these 
functions, the escaping air carries 
with it a quantity of spray, which 
shoots out like a geyser to heights of 
from 150 to 700 feet. This artificial 
geyser, we are told, presents a most 
pleasing spectacle, particularly in 
winter, when the spray froms huge 
masses of ice about the nozzle. 5ays 
the writer:
When an three of the intake pipes 
are in operation, a total of 5,000 horse
power is available. However, one in
take pipe has been found to -furnish 
all the power necessary for operating 
the machinery of the mill and mine. 
With this single intake, while deliv
ering 11,930 cubic feet of air per min
ute at an absolute pressure of 128 
pounds, an efficiency of 82 per cent, 
is shown. A turbine operating with a 
loss of 10 or 12 per cent, may be con
sidered remarkably efficient; but be
fore this mechanical power can be 
converted into comprest air, a loss of 
at least 30 per cent, more must take 
place. The remarkable efficiency of

the direct hydraulic compression is 
thus made apparent; but we should 
also take into calculation the remark
able economy of operation; for the hy
draulic compressor contains no ma
chinery which requires attention or 
is liable to become deranged...................
One of the chief advantages of this 
system is the fact that the compres
sion is isothermal. As the bubbles of 
the air are carried down the intake 
pipe they are comprest, but the heat 
of compression is conducted off by the 
water which surrounds them. In the 
ordinary systems of compressing air a 
great deal of difficulty is experienced 
owing to the increase of temperature 
due to the compression, and also ow
ing to the condensation of water vapor 
which occurs with a fall of tempera
ture, or an increase of pressure, or 
both. However, the air which is trapt 
in the rock chamber at the Victoria 
mine is of a temperature almost as 
low as that of the wrater, and is prac
tically free from moisture.

THE CARNEGIE TECHNICAL 
SCHOOLS.
It was late in the year 1900 that 
Mr. Carnegie made the definite offer 
to the city of Pittsburg of the money 
with which to establish a technical 
school for both sexes, on condition 
that the city would provide a suitable 
site. Early in the following year the 
city councils formally accepted the 
gift. More than two years were then 
spent in the selection and purchase 
of the grounds for the school. In 
September, 1903, the present site of 
thirty-two acres of land adjoining 
Schenley Park was purchased by the 
city and turned over to the trustees 
of the school.
In the meantime a committee of 
the board of trustees, assisted by an 
advisory committee from without the 
board, had outlined a plan for the 
proposed school, which was submitted 
to Mr. Carnegie, and approved by 
him. Mr. Carnegie then agreed to 
place at the disposal of the trustees 
of Carnegie Institute a sufficient fund 
with which to erect the necessary 
buildings. The buildings already com
pleted and those in process of con
struction, together with their equip
ment, represent an expenditure of 
approximately $1,500,000. In addition 
to that Mr. Carnegie has set aside 
$4,000,000 in United States Steel bonds
to constitute a permanent endowment 
for the institution.
In November, 1903, the committee 
on technical schools, after a careful 
canvass of the men available for the 
headship of the new institution, in
vited Mr. Arthur A. Hamerschlag to 
take charge of the organization and 
direction of the work of the school. 
Not only was the rapid completion of 
the present buildings and the early 
inauguration of actual instruction in 
the schools due to his untiring energy, 
but the entire organization of the work 
of the school, so far as it departs 
from that of previous institutions of a 
similar character, is the outgrowth of 
his original ideas. The schools as 
they stand today are a monument to 
his energy and initiative.
As soon as possible after the se
lection of the site for the school, ar
chitects wer,e invited to submit plans 
for the entire group of buildings. The 
plans offered by Palmer & Mornbostel 
of New York, were accepted. The ar
chitectural scheme provides for the 
housing of the four separate schools 
contemplated in the plan of the in
stitution in as many distinct but con
nected buildings. The buildings when 
completed will constitute a quadrangle 
enclosing a large open court. The 
classrooms, laboratories and shops 
will extend out from a system of cor
ridors which will connect the entire 
series of buildings. The plan assures 
unusually well lighted shops and lab
oratories, as all of them are open to 
the light and air on three sides.
Ground was broken in April, 1905, 
and in October of the same year, the 
first class in the Day School of Ap
plied Science began its work.
The schools are divided into four 
distinct departments, known respect
ively as the School of Applied Science, 
the School of Applied Design, the 
School of Apprentices and Journey
men, often spoken of as the Trade 
School, and the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School for Women. The 
first three schools are for men, the 
last one for women. All schools have 
both day and night courses. The Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie School for 
Women has subdivisions correspond
ing approximately to the three schools 
for men. Its regular day work con
sists of technical courses, correspond
ing to the courses offered in the 
School of Applied Science and the 
School of Applied Design, while its
night courses are trade courses, simi
lar in character to those offered in 
the School of Apprentices and Jour
neymen.
The establishment of the new school 
was abundantly justified by the em
barrassing number of applications for 
admission to its first year classes. 
The limited quarters then available 
made it necessary to restrict sharply 
the size of the classes, but by careful 
planning in the utilization of the 
buildings already completed room was 
found for 759 students during the 
first year.
To understand the work being car
ried on at the Carnegie Technical 
Schools it must be borne in mind that 
each of the four schools is virtually 
independent; each has aims and 
methods of its own, depending partly 
upon the character of the students 
which it aims to draw, and partly 
upon the goal which it is striving to 
reach. Even between the day cours
es and the night courses in the same 
school, as in the School of Applied 
Science, there are differences in the 
subjects taught and in the method 
of teaching due to differences in age, 
in practical experience, and in time 
available for study on the part of the 
students of the respective courses. To 
each school, and in every part of each 
school, the attempt is made to select 
the subjects and the methods which 
will lead most directly to the desired 
goal.
The School of Applied Science aims 
to train young men for efficient, and 
therefore remunerative service in the 
various branches of industrial science, 
and to do that in the shortest time 
consistent with thoroughness.
There are five departments in the 
School of Applied Science, from 
among which the student makes his 
selection, each of them offering twro 
or more special courses. The depart
ments with their subdivisions are as 
followrs: Chemical practice, including 
courses in metallurgy, industrial 
chemistry, and electro-chemistry; civil 
practice, with courses in structural de
sign, railroad construction, and muni
cipal engineering; electrical practice, 
comprising the generation and trans
mission of electricity, and the testing 
and designing of electrical apparatus; 
mechanical practice, covering machine 
design, design of prime movers, and 
iron and steel manufacture; mining 
practice, subdivided into location and

operation of mines and quarries, and 
smelting and refining.
The School of Applied Design is 
intended to give the same sort of thor
ough specialized training for the prac
tice of certain industrial arts that 
the School of Applied Science affords 
for the various departments of en
gineering work.
The School of Apprentices and Jour
neymen is entirely different in its 
methods and aims from the schools 
already described. It teaches trades 
to those already working at the trades, 
and aims to supplement the usual 
apprenticeship by supplying a broader 
scientific foundation and a wider 
range of practice than it is possible 
for a man to obtain at actual work in 
this day of minute subdivision of em
ployment.
The Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women aims to do for 
young women just what the mens 
schools are doing for the young men. 
It should be borne in mind, however, 
that while the two schools aie includ
ed in the same foundation there is 
in no sense co-education in the school. 
When the building now under con
struction for the womens school is 
completed, there will be almost no 
personal contact between the young 
men and the young women.
Already various organizations which 
include athletic teams, debating so
cieties, an annual Year Book, a week
ly newspaper, fraternities, engineer
ing societies, afid trading clubs, have 
sprung up, an evidence of the charac
ter of the students which the school 
is attracting.
As a result of Mr. Carnegies phil
anthropy many young men and wo
men who now leave school early to 
enter industrial life, and who are 
hampered bv the lack of adequate 
training, may continue their education. 
They will then enter industrial life 
prepared to render more efficient ser
vice, more remunerative to them
selves, and more valuable to the com
munity in which they work.

THE THISTLE.
Ere this publication of The Tartan 
is many hours old, the second volume 
of our year book, The Thistle, will 
have been completed.
This years book is quite similar in 
appearance to the one published last 
year, the cover being the same shade 
of blue, but having a new monogram.
The body of the book is somewhat 
different than that of the first volume, 
in that it is more representative of 
the entire school. In glancing over 
some of the proof the writer noticed 
that the book is to contain among 
other things a picture of Mr. Carnegie, 
a brief biographical sketch, and also 
a picture of Mr. McConway, to whom 
the volume is dedicated, a letter from, 
the Director to the students, com
plete lists of students and faculty, a 
brief history of every organized class 
in the institution, thirty-five or forty 
drawings, all original, photographs of 
the various classes and faculty, to
gether with others taken in and about 
the schools, statistics of all school 
organizations and clubs, some fifteen 
pages of knocks in which the honors 
are pretty evenly divided between the 
faculty and students, and a chronicle 
of all the important events that have 
occurred during the school year. The 
athletic department is much more 
complete than it was last year. It 
contains information regarding all 
forms of athletics participated in by 
the students, together with photo
graphs of all the teams and captain 
of each.
The price of the book will be the 
same as last year, one dollar and a 
half per copy. If nothing unforeseen 
occurs, the book may be obtained on 
and after Thursday afternoon at the 
school building.

COLLEGE CUSTOMS AND TRADI
TIONS.
Any one who has visited a num
ber of our higher institutions of learn
ing cannot fail to notice how similar 
they are in general aspect, yet how 
different in spirit, custom and atti
tude. We find the inevitable campus 
with the buildings scattered about the 
athletic field. We find the students 
at work in the class rooms, at play on 
the field, or perhaps lolling around in 
groups on the campus. If we inquire 
regarding college life we find that the 
majority of the men are there to learn 
and to respect the aim of the institu
tion in its attempt to maintain high 
standard of scholarship and religious 
principles. We ' find that certain 
branches of athletics are encouraged, 
there are musical associations, engi
neering organizations, debating socie
ties, fraternities, eating clubs, and in 
fact all those things that serve to pro
mote good fellowship among the en
tire student body.
We notice, however, that in the 
men themselves there is a something 
which appears foreign to any student 
body we have ever observed before. 
It may be in the way that they work, 
or the way they play, or the way they 
dre^s. It may be in their choice of 
places of gathering or their traditions, 
their respect for the faculty and offi
cers, or perhaps the rivalry existing 
between the classes.
The surroundings have much to do 
with the customs of the students, but 
these customs do not change with the 
surroundings, neither do they change 
with the classes. Interest in college 
affairs do not cease with graduation; 
a visit to any college at commence
ment time will convince one of that. 
But why, you will ask, do these con
ditions remain unchanged, these cus
toms and traditions started years ago? 
Because they help to bind the students 
together, to create a respect for 
everybody and everything about the 
Alma Mater.
The Carnegie Technical Schools 
are new. As yet there are few if any

real customs and traditions. The stu
dents who have the honor of being 
members of the first classes to grad
uate, will be responsible for the estab
lishment of customs and traditions. 
Some will be brought into Tech life 
unconsciously, others not; but either 
way, let us have a care, for once firm
ly rooted they are hard to weed out. 
Many things, that seem absolutely 
harmless, some little misconduct in 
class rpom, or hall, about the school 
grounds, an act that shows lack of 
respect for members of the faculty 
and officers of the schools; these 
will, when repeated and taken up by 
the other classes, gradually evolve 
into customs. Forces are at work, 
perhaps unnoticed at present, which 
in time are going to give to Carnegie 
Tech, that particular atmosphere, 
which will be found at no other in
stitution. Forces that will give to our 
men that something in general make
up, that will distinguish them in their 
battle for success in the outside world. 
There is no time like the present to 
get control of these forces.

THE TARTAN
SCHOOL INSTITUTIONS.
The words school institutions 
have lately come to mean a great deal 
to the average young American, 
whether he or she be college bred 
or one of the great army of workers 
in the extensive business life of this 
country. To prove this fact, it is only 
necessary to listen to the conversa
tion of young people everywhere, or 
to observe what is being read with 
much interest by our neighbors in the 
street cars. Nearly every time it hap
pens that the account of some great 
contest in the college world, or the 
doings of a mutual friend in college, 
is the point of interest.
Without a doubt college athletics 
occupies the attention of all young 
Americans who know anything about 
college lito or who read the daily pa
pers. At the ead of the list stands 
American Foot-ball, which draws 
crowds to the great contests larger 
than any other sport, and which has 
Tjeen indorsed by our strenous Presi
dent as a developer of judgment and 
other good qualities which go to make 
up good citizens. When any of the 
great college teams, such as Yale and 
Harvard come together for their an
nual contest, the whole sport-loving 
public awaits the outcome. The news
papers spend small fortunes to obtain 
information and pictures of the teams 
and players, their daily food, habitSi 
weight and other things which seem 
unimportant to a disinterested party. 
Speculators buy up blocks of seats and 
make a handsome profit out of the 
American demand for sport. On the 
day of the game every person who can 
possibly spare the time and money, 
and some who cannot, appears at the 
side of the field. Members of the 
class of 60 appear in old faded sweat
ers along with the greenest freshman. 
Everyone talks to his neighbor and 
praises his own side or knocks the 
opponents. Truly it is a great game.
Base-ball stands next in importance 
in the college world, but the profes
sional variety seems to monopolize the 
attention of the world outside the col
lege. Of late many college players 
have played with professional teams, 
so that this kind of base-ball is com
ing to depend somewhat strongly on 
college athletics for good material.
The other college sports such as 
rowing, hockey, basket-ball and track
athletics have a good share of the 
public attention, but are not noticed 
so much as the two foregoing ones. 
At present Pittsburg sees very little 
of the great college events, but it is 
the hope of many students of this 
school to show the city the real thing 
in the near future.
Another important branch of college 
institutions is social organizations 
such as the Glee Club and other mu
sical clubs, the dramatic club, and the 
various literary and scientific clubs. 
Pittsburg sometimes sees a little of 
this branch when some eastern club, 
such as the Triangle Club of Prince
ton, or the Mask and Wig Club of 
Pennsylvania, comes to town, as well 
as numerous glee and musical clubs. 
The organization of such clubs 
is no small matter, and the time 
spent in training represents a 
great deal of hard work which 
the public does not see and 
think very much about. Also, the 
business training obtained by the 
managers of these events has often 
stood them in good stead after grad
uation.
Fraternities, class and school spirit 
form no small "art of the American 
college life, and serve to hold together 
men in all classes of society for many 
years afterwards. It is such spirit 
that leads the old alumnus to send his 
children to his alma mater and to look 
with disapproval upon all other insti
tutions of learning.
College men seem to have a certain 
system about everything they do. 
Ask any college man what branch of 
study taught him this and he will tell 
you very little, but it comes from hab
its formed in college, while writing 
and studying, if arranging things in 
order. This system is something that 
business men are badly in need of and 
are willing to pay well for to obtain.
Last in the list comes school publi
cations. In most of the big colleges, 
a daily newspaper containing nothing 
but college news is published. The 
editor-in-chief is usually a graduate, 
as the time required is too great for 
men who wish to get along in school. 
Weekly papers are found in nearly 
nearly every school of considerable 
size in America. Monthly publica
tions are even more common and have 
many ranches, literary, comic, and 
scientific.
Thus we see the numerous activities
of the American while at college, 
which are fine preparation for actual 
life beyond the college door.
R. K. Merrill, 08. 
---------o---------
AL APPEAL TO SPIRIT.
The majority of the students are 
aware tnat a call for track team can
didates has been made by Capt. Dow
ling. There are plenty of good ath
letes who have heard this call, but 
who are too busy smoking a pipe, or 
sitting around waiting for something 
to turn up, to come out and show their 
spirit. Some have done good work at 
Prep, schools, but seem contented to 
let the matter rest.
Now, there is no branch of athletics 
which put a man in such fine condition 
and keep him away from evil influ
ences as track athletics. This branch 
of athletics is the only survivor of the 
ancient Greek training, and is there
fore the most noble in purpose. The 
training obtained will stand a man in 
good stead in after life in the business 
world. If you can do anything in this 
line, come out, and above all, dont 
be a quitter.
BASE-BALL OUTLOOK.
The advent of warm,', dry weather 
and a consequent fast diamond, has 
brought the base-ball candidates out 
in full force. Under the direction of 
Coach Wolf, the men are rounding 
into condition and from present indi
cations Tech will send forth a team 
which will be able to cope with the 
speediest college teams in the district. 
Many good men are available for all, 
positions and the competition keen. 
Wills has proved to be a find in the 
box, and he will be ably assisted by 
Burnside and Patch. Barclay and 
Coursin are the most likely candidates 
for the catching staff, yet at this time 
it is impossible to predict who will 
permanently land the job. Adams will 
probably hold his position at first.
Lytle is a fixture at second and El
liott and Kirk will fight it out for third 
bag. Bingham and Morrison are two 
likely men for short. The outfield 
will be taken care of by Halferty in 
left, Neudorfer, Colmery or Olnhouesen at middle and Slocum or Charles 
at right.

SOME KICKERS.HERE AND THERE.
When the work for Friday was 
announced, there were a few 
earnest curses uttered by dis
gruntled Plebes. Some men wanted 
to work in laboratories where the 
work would be clean, others pre
ferred the shops, but all were disap
pointed.
Todd, who wanted a job in the ma
chine shop, complained that to work 
in the Physical Lab would force him 
to put on a clean shirt in the-middle 
of the week. On the other hand* 
Shaub asks bitterly how he can make 
the impression on the ladies he is ac
customed to, if compelled to wear 
overalls.
Beck is afraid he cannot show an 
artistic temperament by pounding 
sand in moulds; Exline objects to the 
machine-shop because his overalls are 
dirty, while Happy Wallace plays an 
anvil solo, entitled How Can I Appear 
in Public Till My Hair Grows Out?
The result of Saturdays game at 
W. U. V. should be pleasing to every 
Tech man, doubly so to the base-ball 
men. Inasmuch as the Morgantown 
players had the advantage of earlier 
spring practice and consequently a 
chance to develop that important de
partment of the game, namely, stickwork, the outcome reflects no little 
credit on our team. The Tartan earn
estly hopes, however, that the present 
divided spirit among the players and 
substitutes will be eliminated, for the 
existence of a few disgruntled ones 
will be fatal to the teams success. 
Let there be a unity of spirit and we 
may have no fear of the seasons out
come.
Last Friday it was rumored around 
school that Mr. Carnegie had made 
the school another large gift. The 
next morning the "ress gave the de
tails of his latest gift to the city.
Mr. Carnegie considers the Tech 
Schools the most important part of 
the Institute and the greater part of 
the $6,000,000 goes to the department 
in which we are chiefly interested. 
Of the $4,000,000 destined for the 
schools, $2,000,000 is added to the en
dowment; $1,000,000 is for new build
ings and the last million will make 
the total endowment $5,000,000 when 
the buildings are completed.
