Life in Extreme 
Environments: the 
Atacama Desert

the desert, looking for life

Nested between the Andes and 
the coastal mountain ranges of 
Chile lies the Atacama Desert: 
the driest and most lifeless place 
on earth. Until recently, the lack 
of moisture and nutrients, thin 
atmosphere, and intense radia
tion led scientists to believe that 
the Atacama was uninhabitable 
by any kind of life. Five years ago, 
though, a team of NASA scientists 
disproved that theory: they found 
one rock with bacteria. Now, that 
discovery has caused the scientific 
community to re-evaluate their as
sumptions.
Carnegie Mellon was among the 
few institutions to receive NASA 
grants in order to search for Life 
in the Atacama, as the project is 
titled. Life in the Atacama began 
in February 2003 as a combined 
effort between CMUs biology 
and robotics departments, analo
gous teams at NASA, and a few 
other universities and supporting 
organizations. The project had a 
two-part goal: to build an auton
omous rover capable of travers
ing the desert, and to equip that 
rover with instruments that would 
search for evidence of life. Our 
project was the very first remote, 
robotic search for life, ever, said 
Shmuel Weinstein, research biolo
gist at CMU.
NASAs ultimate agenda with 
the project is to use the knowledge 
gained from these projects to un
derstand how life in extreme envi
ronments evolves and to apply this 
technology to future expeditions 
to Mars, where they will use the 
same tactics to search for extrater
restrial life.
In the'vanguard of this inter
disciplinary project is Zoe, a com
pact, capable, completely autono
mous robotic astrobiologist. Zoe is 
designed to map out her location

House cuts $ 14 billion in student aid
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Junior Staffwriter
If the United States Senate 
confirms $50 billion in spending 
cuts, students can expect to pay 
an average of $5800 more for 
their college loans. In addition to 
$14.3 billion in cuts to federal fi
nancial aid for college students, 
the bill includes significant cuts 
from other federal programs, 
including Medicaid and food 
stamps.
The bill, H.R. 4241, was passed 
by the House of Representatives 
on November 18.
The New York Times reported 
that the bill, which included the 
largest cut to student loan pro
grams in the history of the United 
States, was passed in the House 
by a slim margin with a vote of 
217- 215, following a floor debate 
lasting until Fridays early morn
ing hours.
The Senate and the House 
must reconcile two vastly differ
ent plans before the cuts can take 
effect.
Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), represen
tative for Pennsylvanias 14th 
congressional district and a vehe
ment opponent of the House bill, 
said, At least the Senate version
helps more people in the mid
dle class, while the House ver
sion is geared towards funding 
their tax cuts. Doyle was refer
ring to a Republican initiative 
to make $70 billion in tax cuts, 
which are focused on the up
per-class, this month.
The House bill is a little 
harsher, maybe.... Its just the 
fiscal reality. Is it doom and 
gloom? I dont think so, said 
Linda Anderson, Carnegie Mellons director of Student Finan
cial Assistance and Services. I

CMU made a cameo appearance last Tuesday 
night on local CBS affiliate KDKA in a special inves

Campus. The video clip has since reached websites 
such as collegehumor.com, but not before it aroused 
much debate on campus.
In the story, investigative reporter Marty Grif

pornographic film Pirates in the University Centers 
McConomy Auditorium. Griffins report focused on 
two aspects of the event: CMUs providing pornogra
phy to students on campus, and the use of students 
money to do so Promoted as a story of parents pay
ing for porn on a local campus, Griffins report cited 
the film as being funded by the student activities fee 
(the $82 fee students pay annually to support cam
pus events).
According to the students in charge of the event,

Surveys in the Institute of International Ed
ucations 2005 Open Doors report show hope 
for increased international student enrollment 
in American universities, despite another year 
of falling enrollment rates. Fighting these odds, 
Carnegie Mellons international student popu
lation has been steadily on the rise for the past 
two years.
The annual publication not only details in
ternational student enrollment, but the num
ber of American students who study abroad 
as well. This years report, which encompasses 
activities for the 2004 school year, shows study 
abroad rates falling for a second consecutive 
year  not only on the undergraduate level 
(down 2.9 percent), but for graduate student 
studies as well (down 3.6 percent). Rates have 
been declining since the 2003 school year, fol
lowing increased restrictions on student visas 
and intensified scrutiny of international stu
dent travel following the events of September 
11.
Like any other large university, we value this 
international population very much. Growth of 
international student enrollment [at Carnegie > 
Mellon] outpaced national growth for a decade 
or more before September 11, said Lisa Krieg, 
Director of the Office of International Educa
tion at Carnegie Mellon, who helps handle 
international student affairs and orientation.

SUNY-Albany returns 
activities fee to students
by Greg Hanneman
Staffwriter
A New York university must 
refund two students activity fees 
after they sued the school over 
the way the money was allocated 
and spent, a federal judge ruled 
last month.
The decision said that the State 
University of New York at Alba
nys use of referendums by their 
Student Association to determine 
funding is unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was initially 
brought against SUNY-Albanys 
Student Association in December 
2004 by Eric Amidon, president 
of the conservative student group 
Collegians for a Constructive To
morrow (CFACT). It alleged that 
the Student Association denied 
the group funding on the basis of 
its political beliefs.
CFACT, which has been a rec
ognized student organization 
at SUNY-Albany since 2002 and 
claims a membership of over 100 
students, had received $1200 
from the Student Association, according to an article in the Al
bany Student Press.
The campus chapter of 
the New York Public Interest 
Research Group (NYPIRG), 
which Amidon called a liberalleaning organization, how
ever, received $106,000, based 
on a campus-wide referendum 
to gauge student interest in 
the group and to determine 
whether $5 of each students 
$80 activity fee should be allo
cated to it.
CFACTs request for a simi
lar amount was denied by the 
Student Association because 
the group was new and had 
no track record to justify the 
additional money, the Albany 
Times Union reported. When 
the groups request for a ref
erendum like the one used for 
NYPIRG was denied as well, 
CFACT sued.
In his ruling on the lawsuit, 
handed down November 7, U.S. 
District Judge David N. Hurd 
wrote that student activity

had an advisor and administra
tive contact in Student Affairs, 
he said, but the reality is that 
they were so quickly embraced 
by our students that it made for a 
very smooth transition.
Now these same students will

J.T. Trollman
On April 10, 2004, I walked home 
to Neville Street with one ear to a cell 
phone, my old suitemate Bradford on 
the other end in Boston. Two years be
forehand, we had both started shooting 
photos for The Tartan. After Brad had 
taken a year off to study in Nepal and 
Tibet, and after both of us had served 
stints as the papers photo editor, I was 
filling Brad in on the events that had 
happened over the last 10 Natrat-filled 
days  what went wrong, what fol
lowed, and what we could do to fix it.
Just as I passed the WQED building 
and made my way across Fifth Avenue, 
I remember half-joking: Were going 
to be the ones to turn this newspaper 
around, arent we?
Okay, it was melodramatic. But come 
on, I needed to cheer up somehow.
We werent far off, though. And with 
the help of a new cadre of editors  
and a few old ones tenacious enough to 
stick around  we all began the slow 
process of forcing our train back onto 
its tracks. It wasnt easy, either: Wad
ing through the mess, we found a pa
per that had been financially misman
aged for 10 years. We had a total staff 
of around 65, while a year and a half 
later, were closer to 200. And we had 
to fundamentally change the way this 
paper approached both its work, and 
its ties to campus.
Im not going to turn this column into 
a flagrantly self-congratulatory fluff 
piece. But I will say, while I can, that 
my work here has been my defining ex
perience here at CMU  and through 
it, I can only hope that weve given back 
to a community thats done so much 
for us.
Carnegie Mellon has changed a lot 
since I first drove here my freshman 
year in a rented van from San Francisco. 
When my dad was a Ph.D. student here 
in 1970, Carnegie Mellon was a far cry 
from the Ivy League competitor that it 
is today. Theres a lot more academic 
breadth now, too: my dad studied nu
clear engineering, when left-brained 
majors were the schools focus. I cant 
even touch a calculator without feel
ing shivers, but broadened design and 
professional writing departments have 
given me much better options.
This newspaper has grown up a 
bit, too. In the 60s, The Tartan was 
so ruled by Greek life that front pages 
announced fraternity elections more 
often than student body elections. The 
80s were dull for us, with little to offer 
the campus; and in the 90s, we were 
just starting to creep toward a bit of 
professionalism.
By the spring of 04, we had fallen 
backwards, and were teetering on the 
brink of collapse. This year, we were 
finalists for a national collegiate news
paper award. More than anything, 
though, this shift is a direct reflection 
of the quality of students that weve at
tracted to CMU in recent years  and 
I can only hope that the trend will 
continue.
Rebuilding this paper has meant fix
ing an obvious oversight we rarely ever 
corrected: pulling from the resources 
around us. Our business manager Brit
tany Smith, for example, is a business 
student. Funny how that works. With 
her, Brad, and honest-to-God business 
and advertising staffs on board now, 
we actually stand to make a profit for 
the first time in over a decade.
Theres more to our growth than 
money. When I first started frequent
ing this office, each section editor 
laid out his or her own section alone. 
Chemistry majors, engineering majors, 
it didnt matter. And it didnt make 
sense, either. With considerable help, 
last December we created a dedicated 
layout staff  a good deal of which is 
made up of design majors. When your 
design school is one of the top 10 in the 
country, that makes sense.
Were still not where we need to be, 
but were steadily getting there. And 
with the new Pillbox redesign were 
implementing in this issue after two 
months of work, were one step closer.
Thanks, CMU, for helping us move 
towards what weve always wanted 
to be: a reflection of the school we 
represent.

mIm
Senate media policy to go into effectFinal results in weekly 
nuclear awareness column
by Erik Sorenson
Staffwriter
70 percent of Carnegie Mellon 
students who responded to my 
surveys agreed that the single 
most serious threat to U.S. na
tional security is nuclear weapons 
in the hands of terrorists. The re
maining students were divided, 
with half concluding the largest 
threat was a nuclear attack by 
a rogue state, and the other half 
saying it was an accidental melt
down by a U.S. nuclear reactor.
Students were less decisive 
when asked to identify which 
nuclear nation would pose the 
biggest threat to national secu
rity over the next 10 years. Iran 
and North Korea were identified 
to be most likely threats (under 
the assumption that both will be
come nuclear nations), followed 
by China, Pakistan, and finally 
Russia.
In addition, roughly one-third 
did not believe any of the above 
nations listed would pose a na
tional security threat to the U.S. 
overthe next 10 years.
During the first 2004 presi
dential debate, President Bush 
stated that he believed the most 
serious threat to national secu
rity was nuclear weapons in the 
hands of a terrorist enemy. Bush 
addressed this threat in 2001 
when the Department of Defense 
issued its Nuclear Posture Review 
(NPR). According to the NPR, 
new [nuclear] capabilities must 
be developed to defeat emerging 
threats such as hard and deeply 
buried targets ... mobile and relo
catable targets ... and to improve 
accuracy and limit collateral dam
age.
The U.S. is currently examining 
other methods to eliminate the se
curity threat of nuclear weapons. 
In an article in the September 
11, 2005, issue of The Washing
ton Post, a doctrine proposed by 
the Pentagon outlines the use of 
nuclear weapons to preempt an 
attack by a nation or a terrorist 
group using weapons of mass de
struction.
It is not clear that nuclear 
weapons will be more effective
than conventional weapons at 
achieving the goals outlined 
in the NPR and ensuring na
tional security. The burden of 
demonstrating this fact lies on 
the shoulders of the govern
ment. An Israeli attack against 
an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 
demonstrated that conven
tional weapons are capable of 
disabling a weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) program. 
Justifying the collateral dam
age guaranteed by a nuclear 
attack against a small group 
of terrorists is a hard case to 
make. These doubts, combined 
with those of the recent U.S. 
intelligence track record, make 
it difficult to presume the cur
rent U.S. nuclear stance is an 
effective one.
With the spread of nuclear 
technology, there exists the 
possibility that terrorists could 
simply buy a nuclear weapon 
on the black market. Given 
their past history of illicit 
weapons exports, it is very 
likely that North Korea would 
be willing to sell one if they 
were able to acquire a suffi
ciently large supply of nukes. 
Russias economy has declined 
over the last several years, but 
its nuclear stockpile has re
mained. With less money to 
secure its weapons and pay its 
scientists, there is a threat that 
a Russian nuclear weapon will 
be stolen and sold. With each 
passing day, the threat of a ter
rorist group acquiring a nuke 
increases.
While an aggressive ap
proach to remove the threat of 
nuclear weapons is welcomed, 
as a world leader, the avenue 
the U.S. pursues is likely to be 
followed by others. Declaring 
that nuclear weapons play a 
critical role in the defense ca
pabilities of the United States 
does not encourage non-nu
clear nations to remain so. If 
other nations see nuclear weap
ons as the solution to their na
tional security problems, an ag
gressive attack to prevent their 
WMD development is more 
likely to support this viewpoint 
than diminish it.

promoted events.
Arasin and senator Kirk Hig
gins (MCS), a junior majoring in 
mathematical sciences, hope to 
expand this policy in the future. 
At present, it only guarantees 
student media access to events 
funded by the student activities 
fee, but not other events funded 
by CMU. Arasin hopes to attach 
the condition of media access to 
use of CMU facilities. This provi
sion would require a joint policy 
with the University.
The preamble of the policy 
states that members of the 
CMU community must have ac
cess to information with which 
to make informed decisions in 
their daily lives. However, the 
policys primary impetus comes 
from last years speech by Malik 
Zulu Shabazz, during which two 
Tartan reporters were forcibly ex
pelled.
Long Pham, chairman of the 
Academic Affairs committee (Tepper) and a senior business major, 
confirmed that the Shabazz in
cident sparked this. It also set
Pacific rim. In fact, according to 
Carnegie Mellon Today, there is 
an agreement between Carnegie 
Mellon and universities of South 
Australia to collaborate on re
search and education. One such 
school is Flanders University.
At least five faculty members 
will begin in Adelaide in 
May 2006, and student enroll
ment is expected to reach 150- 
200 students over the course of 
four years, according to Carnegie 
Mellon Today. Also currently in 
place is an agreement between 
the Chinese Ministry of Personnel, 
Australia, and Carnegie Mellon to 
send members of the Chinese civil 
service to study public policy and 
management in Adelaide.
a new precedent for restricting 
student media.
The policy was also supported 
by senator Ben Hackett (H&SS), 
a senior social and decision sci
ences major. Also, said Hack
ett, while some people perhaps 
thought of this as a reaction to the 
Shabazz event, in helping write 
the original ideas, Kirk, Joe, and 
I were mainly focused on student 
media organization rights, and 
not specific events in the past.
The policy has provisions for the 
investigation of and punishment 
for violations of this policy. The 
policy states that Student Senate 
may remove any or all part of the 
allocated funds from the account 
of the sponsor of the event and 
recommend further disciplinary 
action for the sponsor to GSA, 
Committee on Student Organiza
tions, or Joint Funding Commit
tee.
I hope we will never have to 
investigate and decide on sanc
tions, Arasin said. We hope that 
the policy itself will be enough of 
a deterrent.
Although the media policys 
vote was unanimous, some doubt 
still lingers in the Senate. Sena
tor Emily Leathers (SCS), a junior 
computer science major, said, 
Its hard to ask a group about meKamlet explained that the South 
Australian defense industry coin
cides well with the information 
systems curriculum to be offered. 
Additionally, Adelaides cultural 
and artistic influence is expected 
to enhance Carnegie Mellons En
tertainment Technology Center 
(ETC) branch in Adelaide. The 
ETC focuses on such areas as PC 
gaming, motion-based rides, and 
entertainment robotics.
Kamlet hopes that not only will 
Adelaide provide a unique and 
beneficial educational experi
ence, but it will also attract foreign 
students to Carnegie Mellon. For 
us, its very strategic, said Kam
let, acknowledging that theres 
an increasing number of students
dia status. If they dont know, they 
may say it will be unrestricted be
cause saying no could endanger 
their chances of because getting 
funding. That could create prob
lems later, such as canceling an 
event of restricted media access 
so as not to risk the consequences 
of violating the policy. This led 
one student at Thursdays pro
ceedings to ask: Are we going to 
make decisions on funding events 
based on whether or not the 
media can go?
As for non-Senate participation 
on this policy, Pham said: Its 
hard to know what to do if the 
students dont tell us what they 
want. We need help from student 
government and the general stu
dent body as well. Historically, 
CMU students have been charac
terized as an apathetic bloc, and 
to dispel that notion, students 
should show more interest and 
be more attentive to higher-level 
matters that affect them.
Editors Note: J.T. Trollman, the 
Editor-in-Chief of The Tartan, and 
Bradford L. Yankiver, the Executive 
Officer of The Tartan, both con
tributed ideas to the media policy 
when it was created. Ben Hackett 
and Kirk Higgins are staffwriters 
for The Tartan.

Heinz School Dean Mark 
Wessel additionally pointed out 
that Australia is appealing on sev
eral levels. Not only is it economi
cally and politically dynamic, 
said Wessel, but it is also an op
portunity for Carnegie Mellon to 
rear leaders on a global basis. The 
absence of language, cultural, 
and environmental barriers fur
ther enhances this opportunity. 
Wessel said, We can have a sub
stantial effect on policy in these 
regions.
For Wessel, the Heinz branch is 
a part of Carnegie Mellons global

National trend: International student population declines, study abroad rates rise
International student Frederik Stijnen from Flanders, 
Belgium, agreed: Its not com
mon to stay on campus or spend 
a lot of time at school where I go 
in Antwerp. Here, there is more 
of a community. You dont sim
ply have school and thats it.
Stijnen, an industrial de
sign student studying here for 
a semester, says hes not ready 
to leave, despite his initial 
hesitancy to come to Carnegie 
Mellon. I was afraid I would 
come here and be a foreign kid 
and be on my own all the time. 
But everyone is really friendly 
and helpful. Both the social 
life and classes have been really 
fun, said Stijnen. Time has 
been going way too fast. It feels 
like Ive been here not even two 
months  Im not excited to go 
home at all.
Eleonor Kramarz, a chemical 
engineering student, is complet
ing her undergraduate studies 
here at Carnegie Mellon and 
plans to return to London to be
gin her masters studies. Unlike 
Frederik, this Belgian student 
said her expectations were not 
met in coming here, and study
ing internationally was some
thing which her parents advo
cated for her. Here, I feel that 
the studies are not very inter
esting or challenging. Its very 
different than what I expected. 
I also have the impression of 
living on the edge of a highway. 
You cant really walk to get any
where, Kramarz said.
Though these three students 
may not have the same posi
tive perceptions of studying in
ternationally, they do agree to 
have learned a great deal about 
themselves and American cul
ture. And if the Open Doors 
report is accurate and enroll
ment rates are in fact on the 
upswing, Carnegie Mellon can 
hope to not only maintain their 
current steady stream of inter
national guests, but a marked in
crease of international students 
in the upcoming years.

International Educations Open

Frederik Stijnen, an industrial design student from Belgium; Eleonor Kramarz, a chemical engineering student from 
Belgium; and David Elixmann, a chemical engineering student from Germany. While Elixmann and Stijnen have en
joyed their semesters abroad at Carnegie Mellon, Kramarz has found her undergraduate experience less than satisfac
tory. Although schools across the nation have seen a decrease in student enrollment, Carnegie Mellons international 
enrollment remains strong.

longer growing at the breakneck 
pace as we were before.
She also explained what 
many experts on international 
education hold to be the cause 
of the decreased number of 
international students: Visa 
problems are significant in part 
because of the negative percep
tion students have about acquir
ing them, she said. I think the 
perception on the street of how 
hard it is to acquire a visa is even 
worse than the reality.
A recently published article in 
The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion cites several reasons for the 
decline in international student 
enrollment as well. Experts 
in international education are 
in almost universal agreement 
over the reasons for the de
cline, said Chronicle reporter 
Eugene McCormack, with the 
most common being the real or 
perceived difficulties in obtain
ing U.S. student visas, more vig
orous recruitment by other Eng
lish-speaking nations, and the 
increased ability of countries 
that send students to the United 
States to provide a quality edu
cation at home.
Conversely, the amount
of American students study
ing abroad increased by 9.6 
percent, a trend that is echoed 
at Carnegie Mellon. Eva 
Mergner, senior coordinator 
for Study Abroad and Exchange 
Programs, said, Over the past 
six years, the number of stu
dents here who study abroad has 
increased by almost 75 percent 
for what I think is a combina
tion of reasons. One, there is a 
national trend of more students 
going abroad in general. There 
are also many, many opportuni
ties for students in all majors to 
go places where language is not 
a barrier.
Mergner also explained the 
value of studying abroad, much 
of which is learned through 
international studies: What 
students report [upon return
ing] is personal growth, more 
independence, better focus, and 
a stronger sense of what they 
want to do with their lives. They 
gain a better understanding of
the world and an understanding 
of the U.S.s role in the world.
This year at Carnegie Mellon, 
a total of 2071 international stu
dents enrolled: a number that 
includes 758 doctoral students, 
718 masters students, and 595 
undergraduates. The five coun
tries with the most students 
(both graduate and under
graduate) studying at Carnegie 
Mellon are India, South Korea, 
China, Taiwan, and Canada. 
The Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology receives the greatest 
number of students, with 295 of 
a total 694 students taking part 
in the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering department.
David Elixmann, an inter
national student from Aachen, 
Germany, is part of CIT, study
ing chemical engineering for 
an entire year. Though he is in 
his fourth of five years of study 
back home, he is taking a com
bination of junior, senior, and 
graduate level courses.
Studying abroad was always 
part of my plans, Elixmann 
said. I chose to go to CMU 
because of the good scientific 
reputation it has. There is a lot 
of freedom in terms of what 
classes I can take, but there is 
a big difference in the style in 
which classes are taught. It was 
a bit exhausting in the begin
ning to learn the American style 
of learning.
Carnegie Mellons reputa
tion for academic prowess is 
what attracts many foreign 
students here, but most find 
more worth to their experiences 
than academics.
A student of RWTH Univer
sity in Germany, Elixmann is 
looking forward to his second 
semester here in Pittsburgh and 
appreciates the different aca
demic and social environment 
that studying internationally 
provides. He was not completely 
sure what to expect when he 
first arrived, though.
I was surprised by how com
pact the campus is, Elixmann 
said. Classes are small over 
here, which was definitely a 
positive surprise. Also, the cen
ter of everyones life is activities. 
There are so many opportunities 
and activities to choose from.

Tulane students reflect 
on semester at CMU
TULANE, from Al
found between the two schools 
was the difference in social at
mosphere. He said, A social 
event here is movie night in 
Donner, while at Tulane its a 
fundraiser at the Boot [bar]. 
Frankola agreed. It seems 
here that people need an occa
sion to party.
While Tulane students may 
have been slightly disappointed 
by the social life, their main rea
son for coming to CMU was to 
learn.
Murphy said, Our biggest 
issue was making sure that we 
spoke with each student and en
sured that we had a curriculum 
that fit with their needs, so that 
they could ultimately graduate 
from Tulane on schedule.
Their grades for this semester 
will be pass/fail and have been 
worked out to transfer easily to 
Tulane.
Most Tulane students felt that, 
while it was challenging, the 
work wasnt overwhelming.
Motto felt that the classes 
were not any more difficult 
than the engineering classes at 
Tulane.
Scott Hatfield, a senior gradu
ate student pursuing his masters 
degree in fine arts, categorizes 
CMUs fine arts program as rig
orous. The arts are a lot more 
prioritized here compared to 
other schools, he said.
Frankola also acknowl
edged the strength of CMUs 
academics: I feel like if I can 
handle academics at CMU, then 
I can handle them anywhere. 
There are some things that
seem to be unique to New Or
leans and have made the choice 
to return home an easy one.
Hatfields face immediately 
lit up when asked what he was 
most excited about returning to 
in New Orleans. The 24-hour 
pubs, he said. Especially Snake 
& Jakes; make sure you write 
that down!
Motto is excited for the food. 
He said, The campus food at 
Tulane isnt that great. In fact, 
CMUs is a lot better, but noth
ing beats the Cajun-style food of 
New Orleans.
While all are excited to return 
to Tulane, they all agreed that 
their experience at CMU was a 
positive one and plan to keep in 
touch with the friends theyve 
made here.
Frankola, who is a Pittsburgh 
native, said, I like how its very 
diverse. Not just ethnically, but 
there are people with all sorts 
of interests and religious back
grounds. I really feel like every
one can find a group of friends 
here.
Murphy was impressed with 
how well the Tulane students 
were able to integrate into CMU 
life. I know that it has been a 
terrible tragedy and a great dis
ruption in their lives, making 
their positive attitudes and com
mitment to immersing them
selves in the life of the campus 
especially inspiring, he said.
There will be a special dinner 
for all Tulane students this com
ing week, hosted by Student Af
fairs.
Leslie said, Ill always re
member spending my first se
mester of college at CMU.
KDKA reports on TBA; students fired up
uounesy es r\ur\M
Matt Jones, a junior in materials science and biomedical engineering, sup
ported free use of the student activities fee during KDKAs report.
REPORT, from Al
way it turns out  which is differ
ent from most films. Moore cited 
that pornography has been shown 
on campus as part of the weekly 
AB Films intermittently for years, 
typically once a semester. When 
porn is shown on campus, it has 
traditionally been advertised as 
TBA, or To Be Announced.
According to Moore, the screen
ing license for Pirates was free, 
unlike that of most of the newly 
released films AB shows. The 
only student activities fee used 
to show the film, which netted a 
final profit of $415, was to fund a 
standard charge of $250 for secu
rity, a $10 fee for printing adver
tisements, a $300 charge for the 
free Dippin Dots distributed at 
the 10:30 showing, and $50 for 
projectionist wages.
The event turned a profit, 
said Student Senator Joe Arasin 
(SCS). A junior in computer sci
ence and history, Arasin feels 
the KDKA report incorrectly por
trayed information regarding the 
events funding. No money that 
would have been spent on an
other activity was spent on this 
movie.
Other campus members dis
agree. You cannot trace those 
resources specifically back to the 
$82 that one individual student 
spent at the beginning of this se
mester, but by no means does that 
mean that student and university 
resources are not being used to 
support TBA, said Graduate Stu
dent Assembly president Brian 
Fifarek.
Upon finding-out about Pirates, 
Fifarek spoke out against the 
films advertisements in a series 
of e-mails to the Universitys ad
ministration.
First-year economics major 
Femi Akintola, a student featured 
in KDKAs on-air report, also 
spoke out against the event via an 
e-mail. But after receiving little 
feedback from her e-mail to Stu
dent Body president Tom Sabram,
Akintola took her concerns a step 
further  she contacted Griffin at 
KDKA.
I know college is supposed to 
be liberal and theres supposed to 
be a freedom of speech, but I feel 
like if people want to watch por
nography, I dont understand why 
they cant do that in the privacy 
of their room, said Akintola in an 
interview after the report aired. 
Why do they have to do that in 
public?
As she told Griffin during their 
first conversation, Akintola was 
also disturbed that student ac
tivities money went toward the 
event. Griffin picked up the story 
as an undercover investigative 
report, according to assistant 
vice-president for media relations 
Theresa Thomas, whom he con
tacted about the event.
But to Moore, Griffins re
port was too undercover  the 
reporter never spoke with AB, 
the organization that put on the 
event.
The organization that put this 
on said that they will continue to 
do this as long as they have con
trol of student activity money and 
as long as showing pornography 
is legal  and it is, for now, said 
Griffin in his on-air report.
Yet according to Moore, Griffin 
never spoke with anyone in AB.
We never said that. He never 
talked to us  how could we 
have the chance to say that? 
Moore said.
According to Griffin in a con
versation after the report aired, 
University administration refused 
to provide him with the organiza
tions contact information.
In an e-mail following the 
KDKA report, associate dean of 
Student Affairs Jennifer Church 
wrote: The university was not 
asked for information regarding 
the students or student organiza
tion responsible for sponsoring 
the event until Monday, Novem
ber 28, at 5:50, which I became 
aware of on the 29th. I simply 
didnt feel that there was any
need to put our students in that 
position, nor to prioritize this in
quiry over other matters, and so 
did not comply.
In his report, Griffin also incor
rectly reported the number of stu
dents who attended the film. He 
said the film drew 3000 students 
in its three sold-out shows. Ac
cording to Moore, approximately 
1020 students saw the film, which 
boasted only two sold-out screen
ings in McConomy Auditorium, 
which has a maximum capacity 
of 445 people.
While the reports factual in
accuracies upset some students, 
the story unsettled some with the 
larger issue at stake: pornography. 
Its not that the movie has sex 
scenes in it that bothers me. A lot 
of movies have sex scenes, and 
they are for the artistic benefit of 
the movie, Akintola said. But 
that movie was just for the gratifi
cation of sex.
After the report aired, Grif
fin said, the stations website re
ceived a stack of e-mails and ... 
a record number of hits on [the] 
story during a follow-up story 
KDKA aired the next day.
The buzz about the issue con
tinues on campus. According to 
Moore, AB Films chairs plan to
hold a student forum in conjunc
tion with Sabram, Fifarek, and 
Student Senate to discuss the fu
ture of porn on campus.
If theres a large percentage 
of campus community against it, 
I dont see why we would want 
to continue it, Moore said. If 
it turns out that its simply a vo
cal minority that doesnt want 
it, then it would be the wrong 
decision to stop showing it. 
Though President Jared Cohon 
did not comment on the issue, 
Church offered this statement: 
AB is an incredible asset to the 
community, but by choosing to 
host an X-rated film, they under
cut their own reputation and that 
of the student community. While 
some may dismiss it as a sophomoric relic of less enlightened 
time on this campus, it is in fact 
a fundamental offense to our core 
values of decency and respect. It 
is important that we each act in 
a way that is consistent with the 
image and standing of this com
munity, and we need to all work 
together more thoughtfully to 
. that end.
The forum will be held this Sun
day, December 11. As of the pub
lishing of this article, the location 
is to be announced.
SUNY Albany returns activity fee to disgruntled students
Scott Hatfield, a graduate student in art from Tulane, finishes off a work 
in the College of Fine Arts.
House cuts $14 billion 
in student aid funding
CUT, from Al
fiscal reality, and all schools 
are just feeling the impact of 
health insurance and technol
ogy costs.
Anderson highlighted some 
of the most significant changes 
found in H.R. 4241, which will 
have a direct impact on how 
much student borrowers pay out 
of pocket for college loans: It will 
increase the cap on student loan 
interest rates from 6.8 percent 
to 8.25 percent; parent loans 
will see an interest rate cap of
9 percent, up from 7.9 percent; 
taxes on student loans and inter
est rates on consolidation loans 
will increase; it will reduce 
subsidies to student lenders by 
$20.5 billion over a 10-year pe
riod; and it will close a loophole 
allowing students to consolidate 
loans while still enrolled.
According to The Daily Van
guard, Portland (Oregon) State 
Universitys newspaper, Rep. 
John Boehner (R-Ohio) stated in 
a press release, This bill demon
strates our resolve to restore fis
cal responsibility and reduce the 
federal deficit on behalf of our 
children and grandchildren. 
House Democrats did not 
share this opinion, though, and 
unanimously voted against the 
bill. The Daily Vanguard also re
ported that Rep. Chet Edwards 
(D-Texas), echoing the senti
ments of his caucus, referred to 
the tax cuts as an assault on 
the dreams of middleand lowincome American families. 
Doyle told The Tartan that the 
Republican strategy has been to 
break the linkage for the publie between the budget cuts and 
future plans for tax cuts. They 
wouldnt be able to fund the 
tax cut if they didnt have this 
budget cut. Any bill that has tax 
cuts, Im not voting for.
Anderson, who has been 
monitoring the situation for 
Carnegie Mellon, said that the 
school is not direcdy involved in 
the debate, but it is supporting 
the actions of its member orga
nizations, such as the National 
Association of Student Financial 
Aid Administrators (NASFAA).
We have limited but adequate 
resources; it will not be enough 
to adversely impact CMU, said 
Anderson. This will not affect 
tuition, it isnt even a data point 
with how we set tuition. Ander
son said that the final Houseand Senate-approved version 
will be conservative out of ne
cessity.
Doyle said, I think weve put 
enough pressure on moderate 
and marginal Republicans that 
we hopefully will get the report 
to look a lot closer to the Senate 
version.
It appears that students are 
also taking an active role in 
putting pressure on their rep
resentatives. The Chronicle of 
Higher Education reported on 
October 19 that 60 campuses 
across the country had already 
begun callingcongressmen to 
protest the changes.
A side-by-side' comparison of 
the House and Senate HEA 
Reauthorization Bill, with differ
ences explained, can be found at

PARTSBD2005SBS.pdf
SUNY, from Al 
fees money must be allocated to 
groups without regard to those 
groups viewpoints. Using refer
endums turns funding into a pop
ularity contest, he wrote; the Stu
dent Association must use more 
objective or viewpoint-neutral 
criteria.
Using a majoritarian view
point-based factor is nonsensical, 
his opinion stated. The whole 
point of viewpoint neutrality is 
that minority views are treated 
with the same respect as majority 
views. That is essentially what is 
at risk in this case  unpopular 
speech will be made more expen
sive than popular speech because 
the student association will subsi
dize the popular speech.
The recent CMU debate over 
the November 20 showing of 
the pornographic film Pirates 
in McConomy Auditorium has 
turned a spotlight on student 
group funding here as well.
I know there have been some 
complaints to the Student Senate 
and the GSA [Graduate Student 
Assembly], student body vice 
president for finance Nicholas 
Scocozzo said  although he 
added that not many complaints 
were directed to him specifically.
Scocozzo is a member of the 
Joint Funding Committee (JFC), 
the group that makes decisions
on annual funding for student 
groups.
GSA president Brian Fifarek, 
another JFC member, said he had 
also received a number of com
plaints about the pornography, 
but students have stopped short 
of demanding an activities fee 
refund. From the people I have 
heard from, no one has asked 
for their funds to be returned, 
he said. What students are con
cerned of is that the general pool 
of student and University re
sources are being used to show 
the TBA.
Activities fee money is distrib
uted so widely, Fifarek said, that 
it would be difficult to compute 
how much is going to a specific 
event. He said he believes it is 
really not in this Universitys best 
interest to provide students with 
a means of withdrawing their 
money from the system.
And differences between the 
CMU and SUNY-Albany funding 
systems indicate that the results 
of the SUNY-Albany legal deci
sion arent likely to have much 
effect here.
There are not really any referendums [in CMUs funding pro
cess], so were not dealing with 
any of this stuff, Scocozzo said.
He said that the JFC does not 
give money to academic, politi
cal, or religious events, although 
groups falling into these catego
ries can receive funding for social 
or cultural activities.
Fifarek said that funding deci
sions on groups are based on the 
specific budget they write and 
other sources of funding theyre 
attempting to use. In the case of 
a small group wishing to put on 
a costly event for the entire cam
pus, Fifarek said funding would 
be based on the expected attento receive funding, Fifarek said. 
Scocozzo said that the group is 
currently working on these eligi
bility reviews in preparation for 
next years funding.
Then the JFC meets with rep
resentatives from each group in 
order to go over their budgets line 
by line and make a first round of 
cuts, Scocozzo said.
Next years final budgets for all
What students are concerned with is that 
the general pool of student and university re

dance at the event and not the 
size of the group.
We try to be as balanced as 
possible in the allocations, Sco
cozzo said. Theres no math
ematical formula here.
At CMU, 90 percent of every 
undergrads  and 35 percent 
of every graduate students  
82-dollar activity fee is turned 
over to the JFC, which allocates 
that money to student organiza
tions after a months-long budget
ing and review process.
Student groups that have been 
officially recognized by the Com
mittee on Student Organizations 
can submit yearly budgets to the 
JFC if they are deemed eligible
student groups must be approved 
at a joint meeting of the Student 
Senate and the Graduate Student 
Assembly before May 1.
The joint meeting gives an op
portunity to both groups and indi
vidual students to appeal funding 
decisions or to express concern, 
with allocations.A good way to 
do it would be to go through your 
student senator or GSA represen
tative, who could then ask for a 
budget item to be discussed or re
moved, Fifarek said.
He added that this method was 
used last spring by some of the 
Greek organizations on campus in 
an effort to appeal for an increase 
in allocations.

Researchers confirm 
the science of love
Science has found the answer 
to the question that troubles the 
hearts of romantics everywhere: 
Can true love last forever? New 
research in the field of brain 
chemistry has shown that the 
truly, madly, deeply feeling of 
falling in love doesnt last more 
than a year. According to an 
article published by a group of 
Italian scientists in the journal 
Psychoneuroendocrinology, the 
euphoric feeling we experience 
in the early stages of a romantic 
relationship seems to have a bio
logical basis. New couples have 
above-average levels of nerve 
growth factor (NGF) proteins, 
which are believed to correlate 
directly to feelings of euphoria 
and emotional dependency as
sociated with falling in love. A 
year later, levels of NGF return to 
normal.

Scientists discover a 
red dwarf exoplanet
A team of French and Swiss 
astronomers working in an ob
servatory in northern Chile an
nounced that they have discov
ered one of the smallest planets 
ever found outside the solar sys
tem. The exoplanet orbits the red 
dwarf star G1 581 in the Libra 
constellation, some 20.5 lightyears from Earth. The planet takes 
only 5.4 days to complete each 
orbit, significantly fewer than the 
365 days the Earth takes to travel 
around the sun. The exoplanet 
has roughly the mass of Neptune, 
or 17 times the mass of Earth. Red 
dwarves may become hot areas 
to look for exoplanets. Of the 100 
stars closest to the Earth, around 
80 are red dwarves.

European spacecraft 
finds ice on Mars
A European spacecraft has 
detected deposits of water ice 
beneath Mars surface near the 
planets north pole. Radar im
ages reveal almost pure water 
ice deposits layered between the 
surface and a lower, sandy layer. 
The water ice deposits support 
earlier findings by NASA that 
suggest water flowed freely in the 
Red Planets early days when it 
was warmer and wetter. Analy
sis by infrared light emissions 
shows several clay deposits and 
hydrated sulfates, products of salt 
water deposits. Taken together, 
these findings support theories 
that Mars once had surface water 
that could have supported primi
tive forms of life.

Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center houses its own

Superman. Super dooper. Su
percomputer?
Supercomputers are one of our 
modern marvels: Theyre faster, 
bigger, and more powerful than 
your standard Dell. Weather 
mapping, earthquake prediction, 
and atom bomb construction all 
rely upon behemoths like these 
to crunch their numbers.
And we happen to have one. 
Most students on campus arent
aware, but the Mellon Institute 
(MI) houses the Pittsburgh Su
percomputing Center (PSC).
Ajoint effort between Carnegie 
Mellon University and the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, some of 
the projects the PSC has worked 
on deal with severe storm fore
casting, protein and DNA struc
tures, quantum chemistry, and 
advances in laser surgery. Eliza
beth Albert, operations special
ist, said, Supercomputers do a 
lot and many of the applications 
direcdy and indirectly help to 
save lives.
J. Ray Scott, director of sys
tem and operations at the PSC, 
manages the operations of the 
machines. He stated humorously 
about his experience: Im more 
familiar with a supercomputer 
than a Dell laptop.
Big Ben is the latest addition 
to the supercomputers at the 
Westinghouse Electric Company. 
It was bought for roughly 35 mil
lion dollars and contains about 
750 servers. True to Pittsburgh 
form, Big Ben was painted black 
and gold, the colors on the city 
flag. When you spend 35 mil
lion dollars on a computer, you 
can spend as much money as you 
want on the colors, Scott said.
Funding for the PSC comes 
from the National Science Foun
dation (NSF). Different vendors, 
such as Hewlett Packard, sponsor 
their construction.
Each year, PSC staff attends 
the Supercomputing Conference, 
held in Seattle this year from No
vember 12-18. The conference 
was an exhibition of projects, 
high performance computers, 
workshops, and more. Bill Gates 
gave the keynote address at the
powerhouse
conference.
The PSC offers many oppor
tunities for students. Sciencespecific workshops, training on 
various supercomputing applica
tions, and summer internships 
are beneficial to students from 
a wide variety of backgrounds 
with majors ranging from in
formation systems to business 
administration.
Regarding working at the PSC, 
Albert stated that things can be 
very hectic at times... When it 
does get crazy [at the PSC], its a 
fun and productive crazy.
New research journals feature student work

During the summer, a birdseye view of your house might 
show little dancing lights 
around it. Up close, these lights 
are fireflies.
These lightning bugs, 
though, arent actually flies at 
all. Theyre beetles, with one 
pair of wings. (To spot similar 
fakers in the future, when the 
name of an insect contains the 
word fly, it probably isnt a 
true fly.)
There are more than 170 spe
cies of fireflies in the United 
States and more than 1900 
known species worldwide. Fire
flies are found on every conti
nent except Antarctica.
Fireflies glow with fire or 
light from within their bod
ies in a process called biolumi
nescence. Bioluminescence can 
be seen when light-producing 
chemical reactions occur in 
specialized cells in the firefly 
abdomen. These specialized 
cells contain an enzyme called 
luciferase and a chemical called 
luciferin. Light is the product 
of a two-step chemical reaction 
catalyzed by the luciferase en
zyme.
In the first step, luciferin 
combines with the energy-giv
ing molecule adenosine tri
phosphate (ATP) on the surface 
of luciferase to form luciferyl 
adenylate and pyrophosphate 
(PPi):
Thought: A student research forum
by Sean Conroy
Staffwriter
Youve been holed up in
side the lab after classes all 
semester, working on your un
dergraduate research project. 
Wouldnt it be nice to show 
your friends and parents what 
youve been doing? Wouldnt it 
be nice to see your work pub
lished in a fancy journal?
Carnegie Mellon is well 
known for providing its un
dergrads with research 
opportunities, yet the only 
school venue for displaying 
student research is the annual 
Meeting of the Minds research 
symposium, held in late spring. 
Fortunately, a dedicated group 
of undergraduates are work
ing hard to change this.
In short, they are creating
a new journal called Thought, 
and they want to publish your 
research. Thought is the brain
child of Han Lee, a senior com
puter science major. He notes 
that while Carnegie Mellon 
already has a thriving under
graduate research community, 
appearances would seem to 
indicate otherwise. There is no 
central icon of undergraduate 
research.
Lee hopes to change this, 
and wants to provide a cen
tral community... to showcase 
the best ideas and thoughts 
of CMU undergrads. As chief 
director and editor of the jour
nal, Lee has the difficult task 
of editing submissions, but he 
isnt worried. Its not as big a 
task as I thought it would be: 
The people I work with are 
really good at what they do.  
Helping out is group of 10
seniors and juniors. Manag
ing editor Victoria Long, a 
senior social and decision sci
ences major, occupies the lat
ter position and sees a bright 
future for the journal: As we 
hope to be sponsored by com
panies as well as departments, 
we hope to reach more than 
just the undergraduates here 
at Carnegie. Were a group of 
ambitious, creative individuals 
who really want to see this be 
successful.
Funding comes both from 
Jennifer Church, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, and Dr. Janet 
Stocks, who heads the Un
dergraduate Research Office 
and also serves as advisor to 
the team. Stocks says that she 
has been hoping for several

The Triple Helix
by Sheila Prakash
Staffwriter
At first glance, the latest issue 
of The Triple Helix  with its 
glossy cover, fluorescent graph
ics, and impressive subheads 
 looks like it belongs on a shelf 
somewhere between the Colum
bia Law Review, the New England 
Journal of Medicine, and Discover 
magazine. The cover feature, set 
in stark white letters against a 
backdrop of prismatic nucleo
tides and eerily lit fingers holding 
a vial, reads Pharmacogenomics: 
Progress Slowly but Surely.
Topics further down the page 
range from bioremediation 
(Getting Help from Nature to 
Clean Up After Ourselves) to the 
future of P2P file sharing (MGM 
vs. Grokster). The trend contin
ues inside, with in-depth features
on NASAs new space exploration 
program and radio frequency 
identification (RFID) technology. 
Snippets on page two broach ris
ing gas prices and utilitarian can
cer treatments.
Impressive? Surely. This ex
haustive survey into science, so
ciety and law could easily take its 
place among the aforementioned 
publications were it not for one 
glaring exception: It is entirely the 
work of undergraduate students. 
In fact, The Triple Helix is the first 
and only national undergraduate 
print journal in the country.
How did it come about? In 
October 2004, Kevin Hwang, an 
undergraduate at Cornell Univer
sity, saw the need for a publica
tion that catered to the increas
ingly interdisciplinary nature of 
students studies. After a flood of
See HELIX, page A7
How Things Work: Fireflies
luciferin + ATP -> luciferyl adenyl
ate + PPi 
In the second step, luciferyl 
adenylate combines with oxy
gen (O2) to give the products 
oxyluciferin, adenosine mono
phosphate (AMP), and light. 
The oxyluciferin and AMP are 
then released from the enzymes 
surface.
luciferyl adenylate + 02 -? oxylucif
erin + AMP + light 
The light given off by the re
actions contains wavelengths 
between 510 and 670 nanome
ters, which results in a pale yel
low light. The special abdomi
nal cells that make the light also 
have uric acid crystals in them 
that help to reflect the light 
away from the abdomen.
There are several theories on 
how fireflies control the on 
and off of their photic organs. 
One theory says that the light is 
controlled by a fireflys tracheal 
end cells. When stimulated by 
nerve impulses, these cells re
lease a messenger molecule that 
activates the chemical reactions 
that produce light.
Another theory is the oxygen 
control theory. In fireflies, oxy
gen is supplied to the special
ized abdominal cells through a 
tube called the abdominal tra
chea. By controlling the oxygen 
supply to the area, the firefly 
may be able to control the rate 
at.which the reaction occurs, 
allowing the firefly to emit a 
strong glow, a weak glow, or no 
glow at all.
Fireflies are very efficient; 
about 96 percent of the chemi
cal reaction is converted to light 
energy. Compare that to a light 
bulb, which gives off only 10 
percent of its energy as light 
while the rest is lost as heat.
Each species of firefly has dif
ferent behaviors. For example, 
some species of fireflies that 
come out in the daytime do not 
glow at all. Instead, they secrete 
special scent molecules called 
pheromones to attract mates. 
The females of some species of 
fireflies are even wingless: They 
rely on their lights to attract the 
winged, flying males to their lo
cation.
The behavioral function of 
a fireflys light is under specu
lation. One hypothesis states 
that fireflies use their lumines
cence as a warning signal. Their 
glow communicates to potential 
predators that they taste bad 
because they have defensive 
chemicals.
But fireflies also use their 
light to attract mates. During 
certain times of night, the males 
fly and flash their bulbs in a spe
cific pattern to attract females of 
their species. These flashes can 
be a continuous glow, discrete 
flashes, or flash trains, made 
of many short pulsed flashes. 
Females tend to be vegetative 
and keep close to the ground. If 
they are attracted to a male, they 
respond at a fixed time delay.
Catching fireflies is an 
enjoyable summertime activ
ity. To catch some, go outside 
on a warm night with a Mason 
jar and wait for a male to try at
tracting a mate; then scoop the 
little Casanova into the jar and 
quickly close the lid. Instant 
night light!

THE TARTAN  DECEMBER 5, 2005
Autonomous research in the Atacama Desert looked for evidence of microbial life
Courtesy of the CMU Field Robotics Center
Shmuel Weinstein (seated) works with the remote team in Pittsburgh from 
which navigation instructions were relayed directly to Zo.
NASA, from A1
Team at the Robotics Institute, 
Zoe has programming and ap
plications that differ. Instead of 
global positioning, Zoe uses a sun 
tracker to communicate her loca
tion based on the tilt of the rover 
and the location of the sun.
As to communication: during 
the most recent trip to the Atac
ama in 2005, Zoe only needed to 
be told a destination. How to get 
there was completely up to her.
Her current automatization 
puts Zoe far ahead of her pre
decessor, Hyperion, the robot 
used in the first mission to the 
Atacama in 2003. All navigation 
for Hyperion was done manually 
on site, and earlier prototypes of 
Zoe were controlled at all times 
from the remote control center 
in Pittsburgh. Although soil sam
pling is still done manually, it is 
not inconceivable for Zoe to be 
able to do all of that herself in the 
future. .
The assumption that life ex
ists in space is based on the abil
ity to find environments similar 
to Earth. This does not put Mars 
out in left field in terms of looking 
for organisms. What we would 
consider life, reproducible organ
isms that can move and exist and 
maybe evolve into higher organ
isms, probably have [elements]
just like we have on Earth, said 
Alan Waggoner, director of the 
Molecular Biosensor and Imaging 
Center. You get the kind of bond 
breaking and bond making that 
occurs on a time scale that is rea
sonable for having life.
The aforementioned elements 
are available on Mars, but they 
may not be the same as those on 
Earth. In fact, since Mars atmo
sphere is mostly carbon dioxide, 
any found organisms could in
stead resemble life on primitive 
Earth, when it had a CO2 atmo
sphere as well.
In order to achieve the second 
goal of the project and search 
for life in the Atacama, a team of 
biologists headed by Waggoner 
developed four fluorescent dyes 
that tag the macromolecules in
dicative of life: proteins, carbohy
drates, lipids (fats), and nucleic 
acids (DNA and RNA). The dyes 
are designed to fluoresce only 
when bound to the target mol
ecule, to prevent mistaking ran
dom background fluorescence for 
data.
The project goals may have con
flicted had the biology and robot
ics departments not been able to 
collaborate and create solutions 
together. While the engineers 
needed Zoe to cover a certain 
amount of ground, the biologists 
cannot sample if the rover is mov
ing. Also, recording the fluoresence pattern on the ground cre
ated problems because capturing 
fluorescence is done in the dark. 
David Pane recalled that [they] 
wanted to put a shroud over [the 
instrument]... and the rover guys 
said no way... its too difficult. A 
shroud would have made Zo too 
bulky, particularly when facing 
strong desert winds.
Responding to the crisis, Wag
goners team was able to develop 
a daytime fluorescent imager, ca
pable of recording fluorescence 
in broad daylight. It was a mul
tidisciplinary type of effort, Pane 
said. As a result, we developed 
something very novel in this day
time fluorescent imager. I think it 
was a big plus to have input from 
two different types of people.
The fluorescent pattern can 
provide valuable information 
about the presence of life relative 
to terrain, albeit on an extreme 
microscale. For example, a me
dium-sized rock appeared, when 
examined under fluorescent 
light, to have patterns of macro
molecules along its ridges. The 
rock implies that terrain has a lot 
to do with the presence of life, 
and that studying geography is 
a good tool for predicting where 
life might be.
One of the ultimate goals of 
this project to aid in astrobiology ... is to learn how to look for 
those teeny-weeny microhabitats 
that would support life in the dri
est areas, Weinstein said. That 
would aid in their strategy on 
how to look for life somewhere 
else. Mars is one prime example.
Back on earth, while identify
ing macromolecules on the sur
face of the Atacama Desert was a 
breakthrough in itself, conduct
ing ground truth experiments 
were important to verify that 
there were organisms present. 
Edwyn Minkley, director of the 
Center for Biotechnology and En
vironmental Processes, took on 
the task.
Ground truth involves analyz
ing the soil sample to determine 
if and how many microorgan
isms are present, said Minkley. 
Amazingly, microbes were pres
ent in every single soil sample 
analyzed.
The interesting question to ask 
about these organisms, accord
ing to Minkley, is, what are these 
organisms surviving on? He pro
posed that they might exist in re
lationships where one organisms 
byproducts help others to grow.
Having developed such sophis
ticated rovers, when will they 
go to Mars? Apparently not for 
a while. Weinstein declared that 
the next mission to Mars has al
ready been selected, but that Zoe
might be going in 2015 or 2016.
Even if the technology never 
makes it to Mars, implications of 
the Life in the Atacama research 
over the last three years are farreaching. The ease of using a 
rover to explore places where a 
human cannot go will expand 
knowledge about life in extreme 
environments.
The greater knowledge you 
have of how [an] organism man
ages to survive ... may lead to sci
entific discoveries to understand 
how life works, said Weinstein.
For now, the NASA grant is up.
However, the work is not over. 
The goals of this particular proj
ect may have been met, but they 
spark many new questions about 
where we can look for life, how to 
do it, and what we can learn from 
the myriad of organisms that, in 
all probability, exist in plenty. 
Searching for answers to these 
questions under the polar ice caps 
or in underwater sink holes is only 
the beginning. As Weinstein said: 
There is the scientific thing that 
is of value, and then [there is] 
what you can do with that knowl
edge that is of value.
Thought to explore any 
undergraduate research
THOUGHT, from A6
research journal would be ini
tiated at Carnegie Mellon. 
While CMU students have 
attempted to create such a 
journal in the past, thorny 
issues involving intellectual 
property rights and the neces
sity of writing for a general au
dience have prevented them. 
But Stocks has faith in the 
new group of students, and 
has been very impressed with 
[their] organizational skills 
and enthusiasm.
In preparation for their 
inaugural issue, the staff of
Thought is looking for sub
missions from undergraduate 
researchers. Stocks says that 
submissions should be writ
ten for a general audience
 not necessarily for people 
in the authors field of study. 
While Long admitted that we 
have received a very limited 
number of research projects so 
far, the staff hopes that sub
missions will allow them to 
publish Thought by early next 
semester.

Journal offers student views on science
HELIX, from A6
support from students and faculty, 
Hwang and others set about cul
tivating their journal, which had 
already caught the attention of UC 
Berkeley, Stanford, and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. In Janu
ary, the journal became national. 
By March 2005, Cornell had suc
ceeding in publishing and releas
ing 1000 copies to students and 
faculty.
Since then, Columbia, Johns 
Hopkins, Dartmouth, Brown, MIT, 
and Yale have all joined ranks with 
The Triple Helix. Thanks to the ef
forts of Mizel Djukic, a business
administration major with a minor 
in physics, that prestigious group 
is about to welcome its newest 
member.
I actually heard about The Tri
ple Helix from a friend of mine at 
CMU who knows the CEO, Kevin 
Hwang, said Djukic, president 
and founder of the CMU chapter. 
He told me that theres this jour
nal [Kevin] was starting about sci
ence, and society and technology 
and stuff... and I said, Why dont 
we have one?
The question was a valid one. 
The interdisciplinary nature of The 
Triple Helix seems an ideal fit for a 
university celebrated for its inter
disciplinary initiatives. And thats 
what sparked my interest, said 
Djukic. CMU has great resources 
for such an organization, and I 
was completely surprised that we 
didnt have something like this.
Each chapter of The Triple He
lix produces its own journal, is
sued throughout the university. 
The best articles from individual 
chapters will be featured in the 
national journal.
Articles can range from the 
commonplace to the esoteric, but 
potential writers shouldnt be in
timidated by the content  none 
of the articles publish original re
search. Were not a research jour
nal, said Djukic. Were inves
tigating other peoples research 
and analyzing how its being done 
and how it affects the society in
volved.
Jordan Bates, the journals tech
nology chair, added: Its more 
about keeping people updated 
about the state of science in the 
nation.
Those interested in contributing 
to the organization are encour
aged to go to the national web
site at www.thetriplehelix.org, 
as well CMUs chapter website at

KDKAs sensationalism misrepresents CMU
Local TV report all too indicative of yellow journalism
If Sunday night at the movies has 
taken a curious twist, then Tuesday 
night on TV news has taken a peculiar 
turn as well.
Local Pittsburgh news station KDKA 
featured a special five-minute investiga
tive report last Tuesday on CMUs recent 
campus TBA pornography screening. 
Frankly, college sexuality isnt such big 
news that a television news station needs 
to whip up a sensationalist piece to cover 
it.
Theres nothing new about this sen
sationalism: The American media are 
obsessed with overblowing anything sex
ual, and broadcast journalism is the big
gest offender; unfortunately, KDKAs lack 
of investigation in their investigative 
reporting isnt surprising. Instead, its 
all too common. Sensationalism erodes 
the quality of journalism, and thats a 
serious problem. Now every Pittsburgher 
unlucky enough to watch the broadcast 
is misinformed; if that one five-minute 
segment was so severely botched, how 
are we supposed to judge the rest of 
KDKAs broadcasts?
It was amusing to watch last TUesday 
nights report spiral out of control. More 
than a thousand students watched the 
porn at a time, the report said. No, inves
tigative reporter Marty Griffin chimed 
in: more like 3000. Admittedly, 3000 
was the number given to KDKA by a 
misinformed student at cmuTV, but did 
Mr. Griffin even bother to check the 
capacity of the auditorium, which is 
445? Oh yes, Carnegie Mellon officials 
declined to give Mr. Griffin the name of 
the organization that showed the film, 
but any student they interview could 
have given him AB Films name  maybe 
even directed him to its office. Perhaps 
we were wrong in assuming that the 
point of investigative journalism was, 
well, to investigate.
This is one of the posters advertis
ing the XXX movie I found plastered all 
over campus, Mr. Griffin also said in 
his report, holding up a yellow poster 
featuring two pirate women about to 
engage in sex. However, Femi Akintola, a 
student who contacted the station about 
the story, supplied him with the poster.
Were the posters really plastered all over

Rusesabagina raises awareness of genocide
Dont just sit and listen; take action
On November 30, 2500 people came 
to Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall 
to listen to Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel 
manager from Kigali, Rwanda, who saved 
thousands of lives during the Rwandan 
genocides in 1993-1994. As most of the 
audience knew, Rusesabagina was the 
protagonist of the film Hotel Rwanda, 
which detailed his efforts to keep the ref
ugees in his hotel alive, even as murderers 
were climbing the walls outside.
Listening to Rusesabaginas account of 
the genocide was heart-wrenching, and 
he received warm support from the audi
ence, but the event was tinged with mild 
irony. Prior to Rusesabaginas speech, the 
events sponsors, which included Hillel 
JUC and other student organizations 
from the University of Pittsburgh, gave 
a brief presentation called Genocide 
in Context. While students from Pitt 
played on African drums, the presenters 
ran through the histories of 20th-cen
tury genocides that most of the audience 
probably knew nothing about.
More chilling was that some of these 
genocides, such as those in Sudan 
and the Congo, were going on even as 
Rusesabagina took the stage. It was hard 
to deny that the only reason most of
the audience members were aware of 
his tragic story was because it had been 
turned into a film. Five minutes earlier 
they hadnt even heard of some of the 
places mentioned.
To their credit, Rusesabagina and his 
sponsors took this into account, and much 
of the evening was spent on what people 
could do to help victims of the current 
genocide in Africa  particularly in the 
Darfur region of Sudan. Rusesabagina 
could have taken the easy way out and 
lived the rest of his life in peace after see
ing so much bloodshed; instead he has 
decided to use his leverage to ask people 
to help those in Darfur and other areas. 
History, Rusesabagina pleaded, must 
not continue to repeat itself. When the 
Rwandan genocides occurred, no one in 
the international community was willing 
to intervene. The same situation is occur
ring in Darfur and the Congo now, and 
no one has stepped in to help.
It would be very easy to leave Soldiers 
and Sailors and not do anything. We 
tend to banish the unpleasant from our 
minds, especially when it is so far away, 
but Rusesabagina reminded us how 
important it is to be aware of atroci
ties in the rest of the world. CMU is
home to some of the brightest minds in 
the up-and-coming generation. Just as 
Rusesabaginas pleas are useless if they 
fall on deaf ears, our talents are useless 
if we do not have the awareness and the 
drive to help others.
It is remarkably easy to get involved 
in aid for Darfur or the Congo  there 
are various student organizations at the 
University of Pittsburgh willing to help, 
and .those who brought Rusesabagina 
have plenty of resources for those inter
ested. Get involved.
Although Rusesabagina is a hero, he 
should never have been put in his ter
rible position in the first place, and we 
can prevent people like him from having 
to suffer again. We should not wait until 
a hit film is made out of something like 
the Rwanda  or Darfur  situation to 
know what is going on in the world.

Terrorists: give em an 
inch, theyll take a mile
Ben Hackett
Oh, holy irony! The guns are brightly 
gleaming. On November 29, Al-Jazeera 
aired video of four peace activists, 
members of the Christian Peacemaker 
Teams (CPT), taken hostage in Iraq. 
Al-Jazeera reported that the Christian 
peace activists were seized by a terrorist 
group calling themselves the Swords of 
Righteousness Brigade. The hostages 
consist of one American, one Briton, 
and two Canadians. The terrorists pred
icated their threats with a demand, call
ing for the release of all prisoners in U.S. 
and Iraqi detention centers.
, The group plans to kill the Christian 
peace activists if their demands are not 
met by December 8.
Before I go on, let me be clear: I want 
the hostages to survive, and I want the 
terrorist kidnappers executed. This is 
simply the latest instance in the pure ni
hilist hatred displayed by Islamic funda
mentalist groups. Seemingly, America 
still has not learned from past transgres
sions just who the enemy is. The most 
recent attacks in Jordan and the kidnap
ping of these Christian peace activists 
 only the latest in Daniel Pearl-style 
hostage situations  further display the
more recent initiatives. The Christian 
Peacemakers Teams had an Adopta-Detainee program that they even 
touted on their website.
The program was concerned with 
abuses of terrorist detainees; it was 
not at all concerned with our men and 
women on the ground on the Western 
side of the conflict. CPT touts this 
Sponsor-a-Terrorist program on its web
site, reporting: The Adopt-a-Detainee 
Letter-Writing Campaign, beginning in 
March 2004, matched individual de
tainees with congregations, mosques, 
synagogues, and peace groups in North 
America and around the world. These 
groups wrote letters to U.S., Iraqi and 
other relevant officials on the detainees 
behalf.
The program ran for eighteen months 
after which, sadly, the Christian 
Peacemaker Teams ended its Adopta-Detainee Letter-Writing Campaign. 
Even though the program has ended, 
there is no need for terrorist sympathiz
ers to be afraid. The CPTs Iraq project 
will... continue to monitor the situation 
of Iraqis captured by the Multinational 
Force in Iraq (MNF) and by the new 
Iraqi Forces.
Well thank the god of your choosing 
for that. It is good to know that groups 
like the Christian Peacemakers Teams 
are out there looking after the welfare 
of the Islamic fundamentalist fighters.
The next overly sensitive, silverspoon-fed shelter baby who whines 
aloud that Americans need to 
understand the Islamic terrorist 
perspective and consider these 
individuals feelings is going to 
witness a little terror firsthand.
indiscriminate homicidal tendencies of 
Islamic fundamentalist groups.
While they often cower behind the 
anti-United-States, anti-Israel defense, 
these actions speak to a different hatred. 
In the past month alone these groups 
have murdered Christians, Muslims, 
Jews, Britons, Canadians, Jordanians, 
Americans, Iraqis, Shiites, Sunnis, 
Kurds, and many others. The next overly 
sensitive, silver-spoon-fed shelter baby 
who whines aloud that Americans need 
to understand the Islamic terrorist per
spective and consider these individuals 
feelings is going to witness a little terror 
firsthand.
The situation surrounding these 
Christian peace activists abduction is 
worthy of examination. The human ele
ment of the story is tragic. Nevertheless, 
kidnapping members in the Christian 
Peacemaker Teams has an element of 
perverse irony.
The CPT is a favorite among terrorist 
sympathizers. The organization, which 
has a non-missionary and supposedly 
humanitarian objective, has been al
lowed to operate freely in dangerous 
areas throughout the region. Muslim 
advocacy groups realize the image 
problems associated with the potential 
deaths of these activists. The Association 
of Muslim Scholars has pleaded for the 
release of these members, remarking 
that the release would highlight the 
groups good efforts in helping those 
in need.
Another reason that the Christian 
Peacemaker Teams group is viewed fa
vorably by members of Hamas in the 
Gaza Strip and al-Qaeda-related groups 
in Iraq is directly tied to one of its
After all, out of all parties involved in 
this epic struggle, the CPT would have 
one believe that the enemy combat
ants are in need of the most help and 
concern.
CPT on its website pleads for the safe 
return of its members. But just look at 
the tone of the remarks to peek into the 
fantasy world in which these sad groups 
live. The CPT is distressed that those 
who have taken our friends, Harmeet, 
Tom, Norman and Jim, could try and 
bargain with their lives. This is both 
normal, and almost human-sounding; 
but right after that statement, these 
people and reality officially divorce 
each other.
The CPT states that we want to un
derstand why they would do such a 
thing. Yes, let us empathize with the 
terrorists. The CPT goes on to plead 
with the Islamic fundamentalists, trying 
to show support for their cause, stating 
that CPT has consistently opposed the 
war and the continuing presence of 
multinational forces in Iraq.
This is where the irony is in full ef
fect. The CPT, and similar leftist sym
pathizers, plainly cannot understand 
why they are targeted as well. After all, 
they already have given concessions 
and are even working on the terrorists 
behalf. The policies of the CPT and of 
governments who take similar conces
sionary stances have once again been 
exposed as the malformed brainchil
dren of warped politics.

My heroes have radio voices. 
My heroes have a passion for 
vocalizing information in a 
way that at once soothes and 
enlightens. This intense fervor 
makes a radio voice as inspir
ing as it can be, and I see that 
energy as a vital part of an on-air 
personality. When I tune into the 
airwaves, I know from experi
ence that captivating voices exist 
only at the bottom of the FM 
radio dial.
There, devoted public radio 
engages its audience with excel
lent content, all of which comes 
from the passion in those voices. 
Their institution remains worth
while because listeners share a 
special bond with their public 
radio station. They know th sta
tion will never betray their trust.
In trying to maintain that trust 
public broadcasting travels a road 
littered with obstacles. Quality 
media is not always easy. The 
former chief of the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting, Kenneth 
Tomlinson, has come under fire 
in recent weeks for attempting 
to over-regulate his company. 
He threatened to withhold fund
ing from certain organizations 
if they did not balance their 
programming, set up committees 
to observe NPR and public tele
vision programs, and instituted 
political tests for new recruits. 
Tomlinson aimed eventually to

Mr. Sherman, have you ever 
heard the story of Frankensteins 
monster? Its pretty famous. You 
see, this scientist creates a living 
being out of dead tissue. He 
creates it to further the scientific 
cause, but he also creates it to 
satisfy his own hubris. Wanting 
to be in control of something, 
he created a monster to call his 
own.
But things didnt go as he had 
planned. The monster got free and 
started wreaking havoc all over 
the village. Townspeople tried to 
kill him to end the madness, but 
he was too powerful. Eventually 
the monster decided to leave the 
village and go where he couldnt 
hurt anyone anymore.
It must feel good to create 
something, Mr. Sherman. You 
and your cohorts at the Recording 
Industry Association of America 
have created your own monster 
after years of mistreating your 
customer base. The only problem 
is, you arent learning a lesson 
from the good doctor. Your mon
ster has gotten out of control and 
hasnt decided to leave. Because 
your monster still has a score to 
settle.
When you envisioned the 
world of digital audio, you saw
the stunning clarity that CDs of
fered over cassette tapes. You saw 
the wonders of infinite storage 
space and infinite data lifetimes. 
No longer would a dirty mag
netic strip or the cracked cas
ing of a cassette tape ruin your 
customers experiences. No lon
ger would we have to fast-for
ward through songs we dont like 
and use guesswork to figure out 
where that killer riff is. But best 
of all? No more mix tapes. Radio 
rips would be a thing of the past, 
and your perfect circle of digital 
protection would keep the royal
ties rolling.
You underestimated us. Com
puters grew in power and ca
pability. Disc burners became 
affordable, then commonplace. 
Enterprising software writers 
cracked the code on your discs 
and learned to compress the data 
into handy, compact MP3 files. 
And then Shawn Fanning figured 
out the easiest way to distribute 
them. He called it Napster.
Napster revolutionized every
thing. Virtually any song anyone 
wanted was about three clicks 
away. The peer-to-peer paradigm 
matured and spread over the 
next few years. The programs 
got more advanced, the networks 
exploded in size, and filesharing 
became the easiest way to get 
what everyone wanted. You tried 
to stop it. Repeatedly. But the

Its hard to believe that the 
semester is coming to an end. 
There is much that I would like to 
report right now, but with space 
and time constraints, I will at

If there is something you would

to ask me anytime.
As you can guess, the most 
important issue I am currently 
working on is addressing the 
showing of pornographic films 
on campus. I have been working 
diligently with the other branches 
of student government to plan a 
forum to discuss this issue. The 
two main questions we have seen 
are: Should pornographic films 
be shown on campus? And what, 
if any, considerations should be 
made when advertising for a por
nographic event?
After spending time thinking 
about the most effective discus
sion on this issue, I realized that 
it would be best to have the input 
of other thoughtful and engaged 
community members. So, I have 
asked two professors to moderate 
this forum.
The forum will be held on 
Sunday, December 11, at 4:30 pm 
in Rangos 3. I apologize for any 
inconveniences that this date and 
time may cause, but it was one of 
the only dates not during final 
exams that could accommodate 
all major organizations and lead
ers. Please come and voice your 
opinions on this serious matter, 
and if you cant make it, please 
send an e-mail to concerns@ and 
your opinion will be voiced at 
the forum. One final point about 
the discussion: I would like to 
stay away from a debate on the 
morality of pornography, and in
stead focus on how it affects our 
campus. I look forward to hear
ing from you at the forum.
On another note, I am 'cur
rently sitting on tliree commit
tees of the Utmost importance: 
President Cohons Diversity 
Advisory Council (DAC), the 
Dining Committee, and the 
Search Committee for a new 
Dean of Student Affairs. As for 
the Search Committee, I am one 
of three students on the com
mittee, and will do my best to 
find someone who has the stu
dents best interests at heart. 
The Dining Student Advisory 
Council will have its first meet
ing on December 13. As a mem
ber of the DAC, I sit on the 
Undergraduate Working Group, 
which deals with diversity in the 
undergraduate student body and 
works toward improving aware
ness of the diversity we already 
have on this campus. The groups 
will continue to meet next semes
ter I will keep you updated on 
their progress.
Id like to wish all of you the 
best of luck on your finals and 
projects, a happy holiday season, 
a well-rested break, and a joyous 
new year!

sued finds its cause in a love of 
excellence in public broadcast
ing. Yes, Tomlinson should stand 
trial for his means, but the ends 
he sought do not deserve abuse. 
In fact, I praise Tomlinson for 
bringing to light these issues and 
trying to make public broadcast
ing exemplary. He wanted to give 
the public broadcasting audience 
more reason to trust and enjoy 
their local stations.
As a part of this public broad
casting, NPR, its member sta
tions, and other public radio 
institutions have to prove that 
they can remain a part of legiti
mate media. They have to sell 
themselves to their listeners 
directly, and we all have heard or 
seen those intense money drives 
during which public media vali
dates its own existence though 
the donations of its listeners. For 
public radio, the drives make it 
far more accountable and respon
sible for its content than normal 
radio elsewhere on the dial. A 
distinct reciprocity emerges from 
this relationship as listeners and 
their radio exchange funds for 
superb programming.
Even if one does not think that 
media should have to plead for 
funding from its own audience, 
these fundraisers work extremely 
well in paying for an otherwise 
free service. Just recently, KUHF, 
the public radio station in my 
hometown of Houston, exceeded 
its campaign drive goal by tens 
of thousands of dollars, and that 
speaks a lot of good about how 
much it has affected its listening 
audience as a whole. It has made 
a lasting mark on the Houston 
area by constantly broadcasting 
content that listeners can trust.
To distinguish a public radio 
listener, one only has to identify 
that trust and loyalty. It separates 
loyal listeners from those who 
flip through radio stations solely 
to find their favorite song, My 
radio dial remains always below
the 92 mark that separates public 
from commercial radio. I trust 
NPRs Morning Edition to present 
the news and thoughtful com
mentary in stories that never fail 
to pique my interest. Every week,
I listen to Wait, Wait, Dont Tell 
Me, a news quiz show, because 
I know its panelists will always 
have witty yet informative takes 
on the weeks news. I am never 
disappointed.
The run-of-the-mill DJ simply 
plays music and talks every so 
often about this or that as com
mercials fade in and out of his 
show. To me, that superficial 
connection with listeners can
not work. Sure, such channels . 
work in their own niches, but I 
see more friends channel-surfing 
the radio above that 92 mark.
At times, I find those stations 
provide thoughtless drivel with
out any purpose other than weak 
entertainment.
One can easily ignore the 
mediocre personalities, but the 
local public radio invites listeners 
to enjoy its radio personalities 
intimately. It creates an environ
ment hostile to distractions that 
makes listeners want to focus on 
their radios. Every time a pro
gram begins, one can easily imag
ine sitting down with the shows 
host and enjoying a cup of coffee 
while beginning an informative 
dialogue. That is the power of 
an experience that only public 
broadcasting can give.
I, like many others, know that 
NPR and other public radio sta
tions will consistently present fas
ahead. When you shut down one 
program, three more would take 
its place. But this is all old hat, 
the same story weve all heard 
for years.
So what have you been up to, 
Mr. Sherman? What has your 
wonderful organization spent its 
time doing? Have you been hir
ing the people who created the 
networks you loathed, trying to 
find a way for us all to get along? 
Have you been asking your cus
tomers what they feel the next 
step should be? Have you taken 
a good long look at the direc
tion technology and society are 
heading and figured out some 
way to peacefully co-exist with 
a consumer base that is growing 
increasingly hostile?
No. Youve been fighting the 
future and the monster you cre
ated. Youve resorted to everyday 
thuggery to get what you want. 
Scare tactics. Bullying. Extortion. 
Greed. These are the tenets the 
recording industry lives by now. 
You are issuing subpoenas and 
requests for discovery like theres 
no tomorrow, as if every college 
student you put up against fi
nancial ruin will put the rest of 
us back in line. Am I supposed 
to buy your CDs because you 
forced my friend to pay you thou
sands of dollars? Youre no better 
than the kid in fourth grade who 
threatened to punch my brother 
in the stomach if I didnt give up
cinating content, and my appre
ciation works both ways. The 
station appreciates its listeners 
for their contributions, and the 
listeners appreciate the station 
for its programming. That, in 
essence, is public radio. Created 
from and sustained by passion, 
the service of outstanding radio 
voices will continue to fill its role 
for people like me that cannot get 
enough of it.

Sometimes covert sexism reveals itself 
on campus, and I saw posters advertising 
Pirates as another manifestation. But then 
I stopped myself. Porn isnt always degrad
ing. Sex-positive and relationship-positive 
porn is out there. I had never seen Pirates, 
and since I am a first-year student, I real
ized that I didnt know what the campus 
climate would be like during a porno
graphic film showing. So I attended the 
12:30 am screening to better assess cam
pus climate.
Covert sexism describes sexist behavior 
when the perpetrator does not intend or 
realize that s/he is being sexist. Psychological 
studies have shown that there are real 
negative social effects attributable to por
nography, and they can manifest as covert 
sexism. Making fun of pornography does 
not make its social consequences lighter. At 
worst, making fun of pornography makes 
its social effects invisible. I am concerned 
for audience members that think the enter
tainment value they gain from porn (even 
if all they do is make fun of it) has no 
psychological influence on them and is 
not couched in larger, troublesome, social 
attitudes. A pornographic film screening, 
devoid of critical context, reinforces what
ever entertainment value viewers receive 
from these films.
Many of my concerns were confirmed. 
Audience reactions ranged from playful 
to insulting, and though disruptive audi
ence members made up the minority, they 
were very vocal. Since insulting, disruptive 
audience behavior was accepted, I believe 
covert (if not overt) sexism is perpetuated

My viewing experience leads me to ques
tion the intended outcome of showing porn 
on campus. Is it to generate revenue? Is it 
to generate controversy? Is it to expand stu
dents horizons and give them a safe space 
to view porn? Is it to give fraternities a 
campus-sized venue for one of their own 
events? Is it something else? Once the 
intended outcome is identified, it should 
then be scrutinized. Was the outcome 
achieved? If so, is the intended outcome 
something we want to foster? I hope that 
the institution will revisit this issue in ear
nest, as this is a prime example of an edu
cational moment waiting to happen.

Where does that leave us in 
2005? Up sex creek without 
a paddle, thats where. Our 
nation has no effective public 
sexual discourse, and we suffer 
dearly for it in unwanted preg
nancies, disease proliferation, 
and social strife. Watch televi
sion for just a few hours and 
youre likely to view several 
public service announcements 
encouraging, even command
ing, parents to talk to their 
children about tobacco use, 
drug use, staying in school, 
and being wary of strangers. 
Discourses in these topics are 
encouraged because they are 
vital to our childrens health, 
safety, and happiness.
Why is sex ignored? How 
foolish must we be to think that 
we can leave it up to chance?
When I was three, I looked 
up at my mother and posed 
that classic question: Where 
do babies come from? She 
looked right back and, her voice 
neither taut with shock nor 
hushed with shame, she said: 
Babies come from a place in 
the mommys body called the 
uterus. Uterus? That sounded 
awfully uninteresting. I didnt 
press the matter. A few years 
later I asked again with more 
resolution. My mom brought 
out her old biology textbooks 
from college, where shed 
earned a degree in nursing. 
She gathered my three siblings 
and me, and explained, very 
scientifically, how a man and a 
woman conceive a child. (For 
the record, at the time I was 
thoroughly disgusted.)
Too many Americans are 
laughably  tragically  ig
norant of human sexuality. Its 
not just children. Its teenagers 
and even adults, and theyre 
damaging our society with 
their ignorant Puritanism with 
respect to sex. Its something

or the apes encountered the 
monolith, or whatever), there 
have been some of us who con
sider certain forms of sexual 
expression obscene.
And oh, what a journey its 
been! In Shakespeares day, a 
flood of marriage and behav
ior manuals counseled women 
that if they enjoyed intercourse 
with their lawfully wedded 
husbands too much, they were 
committing a sin. The Puritans 
considered the institution of 
theatre as a whole  not just 
its sexual bawdiness  ob
scene. Women were forbidden 
from appearing onstage lest 
their dignity be compromised.
In the early 20th century, 
Hollywood was on a very short 
leash. Isnt it heartbreaking 
when Humphrey Bogart tells 
Ingrid Bergman to get on the 
plane, to be with the husband 
shed previously presumed 
dead? Isnt it selfless and 
beautiful? Well no, not really, 
considering that that was the 
only legal way to end the film 
Casablanca. See, back then it
we sweep under the rug, hushhush into nonexistence, or at 
best grant marginal, shameful 
recognition.
So whats all this got to do 
with public pornography show
ings on campus? You see, the 
whole reason pornography is 
controversial  the whole rea
son pornography exists, really 
 is a result of Americas an
tiquated approach to sex. Re
move sexs taboo, and most of 
porns appeal disappears.
Conservatives in this issue 
love to say that they can prove 
that pornography inspires 
sexual violence because sex
ual predators often admit to 
viewing porn. For the record, 
post hoc, ergo propter hoc (af
ter this, therefore because of 
this) is one of the classic fal
lacies of logic. Sexual preda
tors view pornography? Im not 
surprised. Theyre compelled 
to commit sexual deviancy and 
violence. Im sure that that 
sickness also manifests in a 
penchant for porn. I bet they 
masturbate, too. Could that be 
the cause of their crimes?
In other words, one trait 
does not create the other; view
ing porn and committing sex 
crimes may be caused by the 
same thing, but its something 
deeper and more complicated.
When we sensationalize sex, 
we remove it from the realm of 
the realistic, where it belongs. 
To be sure, pornography wont 
inspire sexual deviancy in peo
ple who have a healthy, posi
tive, realistic view of sexuality. 
We must not allow our children 
to go uneducated about this 
matter  to deny our sexuality 
is to deny our humanity.

CMU should better inform students of resources
_________________Liz Schwartz
I got straight As in high school. 
But this is Carnegie Mellon; most 
of us did. It came as a shock 
to me when, at the midterm of 
my first semester, I received a 
less-than-stellar grade in a class 
directly related to my intended 
major of civil engineering. I be
gan to wonder whether CivE was 
the right choice for me. Why was 
something I thought I enjoyed 
turning into such a burden? 
Could I possibly be in the wrong 
major?
So I asked around. I talked 
to some upperclassmen, other 
first-years, and my family
 basically anyone who could 
possibly feel, or ha\% felt, what 
I was feeling. To make a long 
answer short, I learned that its 
okay to be in my position. Classes 
may start out rocky at first and 
you might just have to study for 
the first time in your life. You 
might even fail a test or two. 
ut its not the end of the world.
One semester isnt enough time to 
gauge how well youll do over the 
next four years. I realized then 
what a good network of support 
I had created for myself in such a 
short time.
But what about everyone else, 
like students who, in their first 
semester, transferred to different 
departments, even different col
leges? Where was the support 
system telling them that it would 
take time to adjust? Why had 
no one told them that certain 
departments tend to weed out 
students in their first year? I was 
angry that the administration 
had no system in place to counsel 
students, to tell them to ride it 
out and see what next year had in 
store for them.
But the administration does 
have something: Counseling and 
Psychological Services (CAPS). Its 
mission statement reads, CAPS 
maintains in the Center a pres
ence as a comfortable, inviting 
place which attends to the per
sonal, emotional, interpersonal, 
developmental, and psychiatric 
out-patient needs of students in 
and out of the classroom. I know
I always go to a trained psychi
atrist with all of my academic 
needs. But I digress.
There are many opportunities 
to take time-management courses 
and to get sound advice on my fu
ture career choices. In addition, 
peer tutoring is available for any 
student who needs it. If you need 
academic help, its available. A 
lot of the time, all students need 
is someone to listen to them rant 
about their uncertainties and 
qualms, and then tell them that 
its okay.
Now, some may say, This is 
college  first-year students 
dont need anyone babysitting 
them, but Im not proposing 
that. There is a need on campus 
for academic advice, and the cur
rent system just isnt working out. 
A guidance-counselor-like advi
sor should be established, and, 
at predetermined intervals, send 
e-mails out to students letting 
them know that the Cthey got 
in chemistry or psychology isnt 
necessarily indicative of their 
abilities in that field. Not only 
would this result in happier stu
dents, but it would also cut down
the number of students transfer
ring from computer science to 
English, or vice versa.
If Im wrong, and such a service 
exists, why dont I know about 
it? Could it have anything to do 
with the fact that the majority of 
first-years are so overstimulated 
during Orientation that they 
can barely function? CIT doesnt 
mention it during Orientation. 
Other colleges might; I dont 
know that for sure. Heres what 
I do know: Those pamphlets and 
leaflets that everyone gets dont 
seem to do the job. I cant possibly 
imagine why.
Students cant take advantage 
of a service that they dont know 
about. They also cant take ad
vantage of it if its sub-par and 
time-consuming: The University 
cant expect them to.

Mr. McKee notes in his piece 
about National Public Radio

the run-of-the-mill DJ simply 
plays music and talks every so

This Friday the Palestinian 
Film Festival showed its last 
in a series of films, Rachel: An 
American Conscience.
Rachel Corrie, a 23-year-old 
nonviolent peace activist, Was 
killed in Gaza when an Israeli sol
dier crushed her with a bulldozer 
on March 16, 2003. The soldier 
ran her over on purpose accord
ing to multiple witnesses pres
ent, although the Israel Defense 
Forces (IDF) contests this.
Rachel was trying to stop the 
demolition of a physicians home 
in Gaza.- Five young children 
watched in terror from the win
dows of the home that was about 
to be destroyed as the bulldozer 
crushed Rachel. Rachels parents, 
who are touring the country and 
the world to continue Rachels 
fight for justice, gave an intro
duction to Rachels life as a peace 
activist and the situation in the 
occupied territories.
Rachel went to Gaza to see 
for herself the impact that U.S. 
tax dollars were having on the 
Palestinian people. She went 
as part of the International 
Solidarity Movement, a 
Palestinian-led movement that 
focuses on nonviolent resistance 
to the occupation of Palestinian 
lands. In Rachels first call home, 
her parents could hear gunshots 
in the background. She assured 
them that this was a usual occur
rence in Palestine. Kids dont re
ally know that its not like this in 
other parts of the world, she said. 
A Palestinian child was shot dead 
days before she arrived.
Over 5817 Palestinian homes 
have been demolished by Israel 
since 2000, according to the 
Israeli Committe Against House 
Demolitions (ICAHD). Many of 
the homes destroyed are those 
of Palestinian refugees, causing 
them displacement of land and 
possessions for the second or third 
time since the declaration of the
state of Israel in the Palestinian 
homeland. These Caterpillar bull
dozers are made in the United 
States and supported by our 
tax dollars. In America we are 
often told that Israel bulldozes 
the homes of suicide bombers to 
prevent terrorist attacks. ICAHD 
statistics, though, show that only 
10 percent of Israeli home demo
litions are what would be called 
punitive demolitions  where 
someone in the family had been 
or was expected to be a suicide 
bomber. Over 60 percent of de
molitions are for clearing pur
poses  for construction of the 
apartheid wall on Palestinian 
land, and for creating military 
outposts on borders.
Homes are not the only 
targets of Israels cruel use of 
U.S.-made bulldozers. Thousands 
of Palestinian irrigation systems 
and water wells have been de
stroyed, continuously limiting 
access to vital water resources. 
Palestinians are given no compen
sation by the Israeli government 
when their homes, belongings, 
and very lives are destroyed.
Israel has withdrawn its troops 
from Gaza, which means the 
end of home demolitions for 
the Palestinians who live in this 
narrow strip of land, although 
their prison-like existence con
tinues. Israel does, after all, still 
control borders, airspace, and the 
movement of people and goods. 
Destruction of Palestinian homes 
and property are still ongoing in 
the rest of Palestine.
In East Jerusalem, Israel is 
consolidating its presence by 
using American bulldozers to 
demolish Palestinian homes. 
In the neighborhood of Silwan, 
1000 Palestinians will lose their 
homes so that illegal Israeli 
settlements and Jewish-only 
bypass roads in East Jerusalem 
and the West Bank can be con
nected to Israel. Clearly, the 
destruction of Palestinian prop
erty and infrastructure has only 
one goal in mind: the continued 
colonization of Palestinian land 
with total disregard of the cre
ation of a contiguous Palestinian 
nation.
Weeks after Rachels murder, 
Thomas Hurndall, a 21-year-old 
British activist, was shot in the 
head by the IDF while trying to 
protect Palestinian children in 
Rafah. Hurndall was at a peace 
rally when Israeli soldiers opened 
fire. As everyone ran for cover, 
he noticed three children frozen 
in terror, and ran back to save 
them. On his way to bring a little 
girl to safety, he was shot in the 
head. Rachel, Thomas, and other 
international activists have been 
added to the long list of victims 
of the inhumane, vicious Israeli 
occupation of Palestine. This in
cludes the murders of over 4197 
people, 783 of them children, 
since September of 2000.
Rachel Corrie is an American 
whose name is whispered in awe 
among Palestinian children. She 
is one of the few people who 
have come to Palestine to fight 
for justice and peace. Despite all 
dangers, she stood in solidarity 
with the Palestinian people; a 
true heroine. As Americans, each 
and every one of us is a little to 
blame for the death of Rachel 
and all the innocent victims of 
this conflict. After all, it is our 
tax dollars that contribute to 
the threfc billion dollars that are 
given to Israel each year. Much 
of this money must go to support 
their inhumane, illegal policies.
We, as Americans, need to be 
more critical of where our tax 
dollars are spent. Why put bil
lions into creating enemies in the 
Middle East, and jeopardizing 
our foreign relations, when we 
could be putting that money into 
improving the health and educa
tion systems of these countries  
or better yet, into solving issues 
of poverty in our own country? It 
is time for Americans to use our 
freedom and our democracy to 
right the wrongs we have helped 
to commit.

If stations are wondering why 
listeners are quickly abandoning 
them, the answer might not be 
the coolness of technological 
tools like the iPod. It may be 
because we are becoming music 
aficionados. We know what we 
want, and were not going to take 
their crap anymore.
Why dont more radio stations 
actually play what listeners want? 
Obviously, we can see from the 
success of portable music that
artists out there. And stations 
that play older tunes have to stop 
rehashing the same hits from 
the same bands of whatever era 
they are targeting. Even playing 
a few lesser-known tracks from 
the more popular artists would 
be better than what we have now. 
What we have now makes it seem 
like there are about 15 artists 
worth listening to, and that only 
about five songs from each artist 
are any good. KISS links to a few 
lesser-known bands on its web
site, but from what Ive heard it 
never plays the music from these 
fringe artists.

If stations just broadened their 
horizons beyond the same bland, 
boring tracks that they repeat 
ceaselessly, they could attract 
people like me who dont have 
the money for the new-fangled 
crap that allows me to listen to 
obscure tunes like Crazy Claws 
by Tricky. Instead, the stations 
play the same songs again and 
again. I begin to hate even the 
most infectious tunes out there. 
The playlist of popular local sta
tion 96.1, KISS, has a few older 
songs and a few uncommon 
tracks, but only a few. So I have 
become accustomed to even the 
more unusual songs because they 
are always the same three or four 
tunes.

supporting talent for this team to 
contend for an NBA title anytime 
soon.

first time since Don Nelson 
was at the helm.

^healthy, the combina
tion of he and Flash may 
be better than that of 
the big man and Kobe 
back in LA. The only danger: Shaq 
probably wont be healthy, and by 
himself Dwayne Wade tends to 
jack up too many bad shots. Also 
bringing in notorious gunner An
toine Walker was not a sound
PacBrs
move for a team that thrived on 
its chemistry.
3: Indiana Pacers: Artest is back, 
and if he doesnt lose 
it again, this team is 
as good as any in the 
league. Center Jer
maine ONeal has quietly estab
lished himself as the best center 
in the NBA not named Shaquille.
2: Detroit Pistons: No more 
Larry Brown. Who cares. The 
Pistons have the best 
filTXr starting five in bas
ketball. Maybe the 
best bench too. Now, 
the only thing left to do is give 
Darko a shot. If that draft pick 
works out well know that this 
team is bound for destiny.
1: San Antonio Spurs: The only 
potential problems for this team 
are the additions of 
/ the typically surl;y 
Nick Van Exel and 
Michael Finley. But with Greg 
Popovich at the helm, distrac
tions seem to have their way of 
disappearing. More importantly, 
Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and 
Tony Parker are the class of the 
NBA, and are on their way to 
eclipsing the Lakers dynasty of 
a few years ago with a fourth 
tide. Theyll defend their title the 
same way they won it, with great 
defense, methodical offense, and 
little fanfare.
That is unless the Celtics sur
prise us all! Enjoy the season 
and remember that you heard it 
here first, (unless of course were 
wrong, in which case we have no 
memory of this issue).

were sorry. Maybe 
someday youll play 
for an organization 
that can put some 
talent around you. Rafael Araujo 
may be the worst lottery pick of 
the past 10 years.
29. Atlanta Hawks: Zaza Pachu: lia was a steal this 
offseason, which 
almost makes up 
for the absurd overpayment of 
Joe Johnson.
New York Knicks: Larry 
Brown wont be 
able to steer this 
team out of the 
lottery, even with 
the rapid development of rookie 
Channing Frye.
23. New Orleans/Oklahoma

About two months into the sea
son, now is about as good a time 
as any to take a look at the NBA 
and make some bold predic
tions. The Spurs look good, and 
so do the Pistons, but are they 
destined for another showdown 
in the NBA finals? On the op 
posite side of the spectrum, can 
the Hawks and Raptors combine 
to win more than 10 games this 
season? And, most 
importantly, how 
will Christians 
beloved Celtics 
finish? Heres a 
team-by-team 
breakdown.
27. Charlotte Bobcats: Im not
sold on their rookies 
this year, so this is a 
team that will need 
to make big strides 
in the free agent market in the 
next few years to be competitive.
26. Portland Trailblazers: Zach 
Randolph is a com
plementary player, 
not a superstar. Same 
with Sebastian Telfair, 
Darius Miles, and ev
eryone else on this team.
25. Utah Jazz: Even with ca
pable scorers Andrei 
Kirilenko and Car
los Boozer, un
til they get some 
depth on the bench, 
this teamwill be stuck 
in the lottery for a while to come.
24. Boston Celtics: It hurts Chris
tian to put his team 
here. Paul Pierce 
and Ricky Davis (48 
points, 14 rebounds, 
10 assists combined) 
are the best 2-3 combi
nation of any team in the league, 
but other than that, no one else 
can score.

period. Maurer next leads the 
Tartans against Lycoming Col

Coming into Saturday nights 
showdown with the 12th-ranked 
Rochester Yellowjackets, the 
Carnegie Mellon mens basketball 
team was 5-0 and off to its best 
start in school history. Still, the 
consensus of the team was that 
they would not know how good 
they really were until they be
gan conference play, and took the 
floor against some of the nations 
top-flight programs.
Thanks to a heroic effort from 
senior forward Nate Maurer, in
cluding the game-winning shot in 
the teams 72-71 buzzer-beating 
road victory, there is now no de
nying that the Tartans are one of 
the nations elite teams.
In front of a rowdy Rochester 
crowd, Maurer dominated the en
tire game, scoring a career-high 
41 points. None, though, were 
more important than his final 
shot.
With 15 seconds left and the 
Tartans down by one, coach Tony
Wingen called timeout and de
signed a play for his star forward 
to take the final shot. After a dif
ficult inbounds, Maurer caught 
the ball on the wing, and with 2.2 
seconds left, drove for the gamewinning lay-up.
It was about time I stepped 
up, said Maurer. I hadnt been 
playing well the last few games. 
My shot didnt even feel that good 
in the second half, but luckily 
they were falling for me.
The Tartans got off to a slow 
start in the game and trailed 39- 
26 going into the half. But that 
was when Maurer found his foot
ing. After scoring just 10 points 
in the first half, Maurer came 
out firing, hitting 10 of 15 shots 
in the second half, including six 
of seven from three-point range. 
He finished with seven threepointers and scored the final 16 
points for the Tartans.
Co-captains Clayton BarlowWilcox and A.J. Straub also 
had solid nights in supporting 
roles. Barlow-Wilcox chipped in 
16 points and five steals in 33 
minutes, and Straub posted five
points and four rebounds. All 72 
of the Tartans points came from 
their starters.
The star of the night, though, 
was unquestionably Maurer, and 
even some of his teammates were 
left dumbstruck by his feat. It 
was one of the most unbelievable 
individual performances Ive ever 
seen, especially in the second half 
since he scored 31 points, said 
Barlow-Wilcox.
Saturdays game was the Tar
tans fourth game in one week. 
They defeated La Roche College 
last Tuesday and won the annual 
Radisson/Carnegie Mellon Tour
nament over Thanksgiving break.
At 6-0, the Tartans will try to 
continue their undefeated run 
against Lycoming College Tues
day night in Skibo. The Tartans 
then play Skidmore and Union 
College, two other national pow
erhouses.
Still, if the Rochester win 
proved anything, it was that this 
team can compete with anyone 
in the country, including even 
December 28s date with the Divi
sion I Princeton Tigers.
Womens basketball falls to 1-5 
with 59-46 road loss to Rochester
by Douglas Fricker
Junior Staffwriter
Off to a disappointing 1-4 
start, the Carnegie Mellon 
womens basketball team trav
eled to Rochester, New York Sat
urday afternoon with the hopes 
of righting the ship in their 
University Athletic Association 
opener. But, overwhelmed by 
the Yellowjackets superior size 
and experience, the Tartans fell 
59-46 in a game that was never 
really in jeopardy.
went 8-8 from the free throw line 
and pulled down 6 rebounds.
The story of the game, though, 
was the Tartans failure to hold 
onto the basketball. In what is 
becoming the teams Achilles 
heel, they turned the ball over 
25 times, often at rally-killing 
moments. Moreover, the Tartans 
failed to offer any pressure of their 
own, and managed to cause just 
14 turnovers. First-year Gemma 
Easterling said of the teams timid 
reaction to the Yellowjackets 
high-intensity defense: I would 
say everyone played hard in the
if!
m
mmm
ISIS
I feel with time, well gel 
more as a team and as things 
come together we will produce a
lot more wins. 
 Forward Gemma Easterling
The young Tartans got off to 
a good start, building a 13-5 
lead with 6:35 left to play in 
the first half. Though their lead 
quickly evaporated, Carnegie 
Mellon was able to take a 21-20 
advantage into halftime, largely 
behind the playmaking of fresh
man Rachelle Roll who finished 
with a career-high 16 points and 
three assists, and was the teams 
lone consistent ballhandler.
In the second half, the lead 
continued to change hands early 
on until the Yellowjackets (5-1, 
1-0) took the game over for good 
with a lay-up by Alex Porter that 
made it 33-32 with 14:35 left to 
go in the game. The Tartans cut 
the lead down to 52-46 when 
Colleen Light found Ashley Rothwell for a score with 2:42 re
maining, but the Tartans could 
get no closer.
The duo of Roll and Jeanette 
Schilling led the way for the 
Tartans. Coming off the bench, 
Schilling posted a career-high 
12 points and eight rebounds in 
15 minutes of play while Roll
game, but we needed to play a 
little more aggressive.
Adding to Carnegies struggles 
was a tepid shooting performance 
that left the offense out of sorts. 
The Tartans connected on just 30 
percent of their fieldgoals, includ
ing less than one fourth of their 
three-point attempts; and only 
Roll, Schilling and sophomore 
Ashley Mazziota shot better than 
50 percent for the game.
Still, the Tartans are not ready 
to give up on the season yet. The 
seasons early and we have a 
pretty young team, said Easter
ling, so I feel that with time, well 
gel more as a team and as things 
come together we will produce a 
lot more wins and go into the post 
season well prepared.
After five straight away games 
to start the season, the womens 
basketball team will finally come 
to Carnegie Mellon for their home 
opener against Grove City Col
lege on Tuesday, December 6. The 
game is scheduled to be a 6 pm 
start at Skibo Gymnasium and 
will be followed by a mens game.

Celtic crossovers
The Tossers mix up the punk rock genre
The Tossers, an edgy band from the South 
Side of Chicago, channel age-old Irish Catholic 
mantra through urban punk sound in their new 
album titled The Valley of the Shadow of Death. 
Although one might be initially skeptical of the 
red and black gothic imagery staining the disc's 
artwork, these seven punk rockers music is 
surprisingly upbeat in its rhythm, and resolute in 
its message.
With Bones on drums, Aaron Duggins on the 
tin whistle, Tony Duggins as vocals and on 
the mandolin, Clay Hansen on the banjo, Mike 
Pawula on guitar, Rebecca Manthe on fiddle, and 
Dan Shaw on bass and accordion, the Tossers are 
bom out of "their own brew of Celtic music fueled 
by a love of traditional folk songs and punk rock 
fury," according to' the bands website.
This unique combination results in seemingly 
cheery, Irish-tinged tunes that are actually 
discussing much more serious topics. Their 
message is one of dissolution and an eternal 
degeneration of cultural morality. However, it is 
cleverly masked by a throwback to traditional 
Celtic sounds.
The band members, who have been together 
since the early 1990s, live by the ideals of 
"consuming mass amounts of alcohol, playing all 
night, and not getting paid, said Hansen. Proud * 
of their keenness for alcohol, the Tossers embrace 
their Irish Catholic heritage as they are willing 
to play "anywhere, anytime, for anybody, with 
anybody, said Hansen.
In keeping with this spirit of booze and 
brotherhood, and of a "furious edge that teeters
between rage and raucousness, the group's fifth 
album is fueled by a restless desire for the spirit 
of the underground, urban Celtic culture to be 
revealed. The third track, aptly titled "No Loot,
No Booze, No Fun, darkly describes how the 
sun does rise, the birds do sing ... [but] theres 
nowhere to sleep, nothing to do ... nowhere to go, 
belonging to no one." Depressing, a bit. But the 
artists manage to incorporate this misery into a 
buoyant, fiddle-drawn beat. Perhaps this is why 
theyve been around for 12 years  they have a 
knack for tricking the listener into absorbing the 
sounds of traditional Irish music while leaving 
him or her with a much deeper meaning.
So, then, can you listen to the Tossers and avoid 
being drawn down by their overall melancholy 
outlook? The Celtic overtone is interesting, and if 
you're in the mood for knocking one back, these 
modern-day Irish clansmen will be with you every 
step of the way. If you can look past the desolate, 
skeleton-clad cover and be open to a group 
of city-dwellers who, to some degree, picture 
themselves as ancient Irish settlers, then you 
will find that maybe they truly have something 
to offer  hyperactive rhythms and culturally 
resistant anthems intact.

The Tartan reported increases in the price of 
dormitory housing that were slated to take place 
by 1956. The increases, The Tartan wrote, would 
make dorms cost about 15 to 45 dollars more 
per year. This brought the price of a double in 
Henderson to 300 dollars. And to think, for that 
same amount of cash today you could watch 
a two-inch by two-inch video of Bono on your 
snazzy new video iPod.
In the D-level subbasement of Doherty Hall, 
approximately 30 to 40 pounds of liquid mercury 
were found, The Tartan reported. The mercury 
apparently originated on the B-level subbasement 
before it "leaked through an electrical conduit 
down two floors, The Tartan wrote. A Radiation 
Safety Officer tested the mercury and said it was 
slightly radioactive. So, yeah, about that stump 
you found growing out of your back... stop licking 
the floor of Doherty.
Two campus buildings designed by. Henry 
Hornbostel were renovated to prevent deteriora
tion. Hornbostel designed both Margaret Morrison 
and Hamerschlag Halls, and after their renovations 
they were both pretty shiny. Hence, Hamerschlag 
Halls pretty smoke stack on all our Carnegie 
Mellon paraphernalia.
A snarky Tartan writer extolled the unsung virtues 
of smoking cigarettes. Among other smokingrelated habits the writer said he had acquired: I 
can now amuse myself by flicking cigarette butts. 
For those of you who haven't tried this one, please 
do." Be sure to add this to the list of the most 
useless things you can do ever, such as check
ing away messages, picking belly-button lint, and 
making dough balls out of bits of Wonder Bread.
The Tartan reported on student marijuana use, 
both on campus and abroad. Among the knowl
edge gleaned from this article was, Weed, pot, 
reefer, grass, cheeba, bone, leaf, nugs, fuzzies, 
midis, buds, hash, ganja  there are over 200 
nicknames for the mixture of dried flowers, leaves, 
and stems of the cannabis plant, usually referred 
to in the United States as marijuana. Two hundred 
nicknames, eh? I guess potheads arent so lazy 
after all. They got on that nickname thing quick.

Scarlett Johansson and Johnathan 
Rhys-Meyer stars in the twisted 
love story of Matchpoint.
Courtesy of jrmfans.lrozenwithin.net
Matchpoint hits the mark
Woody Allens new film is darker than youd expect
Iconic director Woody Allen is known for exploring tragically 
humorous human anxieties in his films. In their relationships, 
Allens characters, like ordinary people, often get too caught 
up in their psychological angst, and end up making their lives 
more difficult than necessary. But while Allens newest film, 
Matchpoint, explores similar themes, it does so from a much 
darker, grimmer angle.
Viewers expecting Woody Allens usual tongue-in-cheek style 
are bound to leave the theater uneasy. Through the story of 
a young man whose obsessions get the best of him, Allen 
shows that while we as people are capable of ruining the 
lives of others, the most profound tragedy of all is the way our 
inner agonies can bring forth a personal hell. Our lives may 
take externally lucky turns, but in th end it is our own anxi
eties that control our happiness. Matchpoint is Woody Allens 
noir, set in modern Europe but commenting on universal 
issues of class, money, and selfish desire.
There are moments in a tennis match when the ball hits the 
top of the net, and for a split second it can either go forward 
or fall back, says Chris Wilton  Bend It Like Beckham's 
Jonathan Rhys-Meyers  in the films opening speech. "With 
a little luck, it goes forward and you win, or maybe it doesnt, 
and you lose.
"Luck is preparation meeting opportunity," Rhys-Meyers said 
in a conference-call interview with The Tartan. My character 
recognizes this and takes his chances. From playing Brian 
Slade in The Velvet Goldmine to his performance as Elvisin 
a recent mini-series, Rhys-Meyers claims to be often offered 
roles that carry a sense of moral ambiguity. Despite Chris 
questionable actions and motives in the film, Rhys-Meyers 
believes the viewer is easily drawn to him as a character. 
"Everyone understands the idea of moral flaws. No one knows 
what we think in our deepest, darkest hours. Chris Wilton 
does what most people dont do: He acts out his fantasies.
In the film, Chris, a retired tennis pro, takes on a job teaching at an upscale country club in London. He befriends 
Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), one of his students, and 
even starts dating Toms sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer).
With Chloe's help, he lands a high-paying job at her fathers 
company, and suddenly hes entrenched in the high-class 
circles of London. But despite his new, comfortable life, Chris 
doesnt hesitate to initiate an affair with Toms American 
fiancee Nola Rice, played by Scarlett Johansson. Driven by 
passion disguised as love, Chris continues his fixation with 
Nola even after he marries Chloe. Before long, Chris is forced 
to make a choice between the two women, and meanwhile 
decide whether he is strong enough to leave the high societal 
status he's found.
Although London functions as an ideal backdrop for the 
story, Allen originally set Matchpoint in New York, a common 
setting for his films. Due to financial troubles, however, he 
changed locations. Emily Mortimer, who plays Chris Wiltons 
betrayed wife, said that Allen looked at this particular film as 
"a lucky movie"; his initial struggles with money and setting 
in the end turned to his advantage. It was easily transferred 
[from New York to London], Rhys-Meyers said. "They are 
very comparable in how sophisticated, metropolitan and 
international they are.
As a director, Woody Allen places much emphasis on and 
trust in his actors, even in a film that is very different from 
his usual work. According to both Rhys-Meyers and Emily 
Mortimer, Allen prefers very little rehearsing or talking about 
the script; in fact, he leaves actual directing.to a minimum. 
"Working with Woody Allen was one of the easiest experi
ences Ive ever had. He trusted me as an actor," Rhys-Meyers 
said. He allowed me to bring my own characterization in 
every sense."
The first time we said our lines to one another was usually 
the first take, explained Mortimer. "In that sense Woody was 
different from every other director Ive worked with."
You just have to be in the scene, stay in the moment and 
concentrate," she added. "The finished product is startlingly 
close to the script I read; I never felt like we were being puppeteered. It's a testament to his genius that we didnt feel 
directed.
Mortimers character, Chloe, is in her straightforwardness and 
naivete, very different from Woody Allen's usual female char
acters. Although shes often close to catching Chriss infidel
ity, she remains oblivious. From the beginning of the film, her 
love for Chris is nearly blind. I dont believe in luck, Chloe 
says in an early scene, disagreeing with the films overall 
theme. I believe in hard work."
"[Chloe] is an interesting one because she is not neurotic or 
introspective," Mortimer said. "She is not that complex but 
still has a Woody Allen girl in her. There is gentleness in her 
forgiveness."
"Woody Allen writes wonderful parts for women," Mortimer 
continued. Coming from a wealthy home, Chloe is very rep
resentative of an upper-class woman in Britain, a character 
many Brits do not view in a positive light. According to 
Mortimer, "[Britons] are neurotic about class, and find posh 
girls like Chloe annoying." Woody Allen, she said, looked 
away from that stereotype.
Matchpoint has been praised as some of Woody Allens best 
work in years. While some may be surprised by his obvious 
change of .tone, audiences are likely to appreciate the films 
emotional candor and the strength of character that Allens 
actors bring to the screen.

Oswalt won't be laughing 
for long: he got booed off

Eight minutes with comedian Patton Oswalt
A not-so-funny interview with one of the stars from the documentary Comedians of Comedy
Q: What do you get when you gather a group of comedians 
and follow them around with some cameras while theyre on 
tour?
A: The documentary Comedians of Comedy.
Comedians of Comedy follows the on-stage and behindthe-scenes lives of a group of comedians as they go on the 
road touring some of the major cities in the United States, 
including Seattle and San Francisco.
Sounds pretty funny, right? Well, the success of the 
documentary won many accolades, which led to the taping 
of a six-episdoe TV-series, Comedians of Comedy. As in the 
documentary, viewers get to watch what goes on in the public 
and private lives of these faces -infunniness as they perform 
their material onstage and are put in commonplace settings 
like diners, vans, and hotels.
Although we get to see the secret lives of comedians offstage, 
exactly how much of this is true when they arent put in 
front of an audience or a camera? Patton Oswalt, one of the 
stars and executive producers of Comedians of Comedy, and 
also known for his role as Spence on The King of Queens, 
was once booed off the stage in Pittsburgh for his anti-Bush 
remarks. We asked him some questions, and in a flurry of 
short, quipped replies, heres what he said:
How did you get into stand-up comedy?
I started in the summer between my freshman and sophomore 
years in college at a club in Washington, D.C.
What was your worst experience doing stand-up 
comedy?
Getting booed offstage in Pittsburgh.
What's your favorite one-liner?
I don't have one. Reciting jokes just sucks because it doesnt 
work.
Do you get nervous when you get on stage? How do 
you deal with it?
Sometimes I still get nervous. It depends on the situation. 
Usually I deal with it by having a shot of scotch or embracing 
the fact that Im nervous.
What do you like best about living in Los Angeles?
The access to In-n-Out Burger.
Where do you plan your career to shift towards in the 
future?
A lot more writing and hopefully producing the stuff I like. Im 
interested in horror movies and scaring people.
What makes you laugh?
People who are trying to be deadly serious and dont know 
what theyre doing.
Tell me about Comedians of Comedy. How did you 
guys come up with the idea?
I came up with the idea because I was working with a friend 
of mine named David Cross. He and I were working in clubs 
in San Francisco, but a lot of our fans couldn't come out 
because the price of the tickets was too high. We decided to 
do this documentary. Netflix financed the movie.
Maybe Patton Oswalt is an extremely sarcastic guy. Or 
perhaps hes just not a fan of Pittsburgh, given his brief 
history with the city. Regardless, I would like to applaud 
Oswalt for the complete lack of wittiness in his responses, 
which were extremely hard to extract. We forgive you for 
your bitterness, because after all, you did get booed off stage 
during a performance in Pittsburgh. Next time, you should try 
to know your audiences a little better before you decide to be 
funny  or in this case, not so funny.
So the final take on the man known as Patton Oswalt: not too 
funny, probably not a morning person, easily annoyed, and 
decidedly anti-Pittsburgh.

Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) flexes 
her acting skills in Aeon Flux.
Despite a strong cast, lack of plot makes this film a flop
The worst part of a mediocre movie is that its mediocrity 
shines through in every cell of the film. Its a feeling that 
never quite loses its grip on your mind, no matter how much 
you might enjoy a scene. You might be thinking, Hey, this 
scene is kind of cool, or "Hey, this bit of soundtrack is pretty 
catchy," or any other bit of faint praise. Then every bit of hope 
you had will simply make you more disappointed as the next 
scene assaults you with its own "meh"-ness.
That was how Aeon Flux progressed over its paltry 95-minute 
runtime.
Based on a mid-90s series of animated shorts on MTV, Aeon 
Flux is about an assassin working for a group of rebels plot
ting to overthrow a tepid dystopia 400 years in the future.
Over the course of the movie, the titular assassin (played by 
Charlize Theron) goes on a mission to assassinate the leader 
of the government, which has built the last city on Earth: 99 
percent of whose population was killed by a virus in the early 
21st century  and forbids people to leave and go out into 
the wilderness beyond. Most people don't really seem that 
unhappy, and while yes, there are some shady governmentordered kidnappings and armed guards on patrol everywhere, 
it doesn't seem any worse than a financially well-to-do version 
of Soviet Russia."
All is not well in the last city on Earth, though. People have 
started having vivid dreams and remember things that never 
happened. Feelings exist in their minds that they cant ex
plain. And the police are murdering more and more citizens
for being suspected rebels. The rebels, for their part, have had 
enough  and theyve decided its time to strike out against 
the government and kill its leader, Trevor Goodchild (Marton 
Csokas).
Heres a good point to mention: in the opening credits for 
the film, the story behind the virus and the new society was 
outlined in a series of title screens. It told the story of Trevor 
Goodchild, the scientist who cured the virus and built the city 
to protect those who had not yet died. This was in 2011, and 
the story takes place in the early 25th century. This is your 
first warning that all is not as it seems.
The movie goes on. Asses are kicked, secrets are revealed, 
and Charlize Theron gets to wear a lot of black spandex.
That's about it, though. For all the twists and turns that the 
plot takes, no one ever really seems to care. Theres no reason 
to. The audience isn't given any reason to feel attached to any 
of the characters. All we see is that Trevor Goodchild really 
isnt that bad, and his brother Oren (played by Johnny Lee 
Miller of Hackers and Trainspotting) has a bit of an ego com
plex. No one feels like a real character  just basic sketches 
of them.
Trevor Goodchild is the only character with more than one 
and a half dimensions. He's got some humanity left in him; 
part of this was probably a half-baked plot device. Unfortu
nately, it's not enough. Every other character seems wooden 
and bored; the spark of a love story between Trevor and Aeon 
leads to a couple tender moments, but they mostly just feel
awkward. This is the problem with having emotionless as
sassins as sympathetic characters  they dont have enough 
humanity to remain interesting.
So the acting is bad. Action movies pretty much have carte 
blanche to have bad acting, though, as long as theyve got 
some sweet fight scenes. The fact of the matter is that Aeon 
Flux fails here, too. The sets are fairly generic  a cement 
spillway, an open courtyard, and an ornate library are some of 
the highlights  and really, not a single one of them feels like 
a real place. Goodchilds council chamber, for instance, looks 
like a bunch of people sitting in the middle of a warehouse. 
The action on these sets is simply uninspired. A few high 
kicks, some lame gunplay, and a whole lot of Charlize Theron 
glamour shots  these elements do not a good action romp 
make.
Word on the street is that fans of the animated series on 
which Aeon Flux is based will be a bit disappointed by the 
film; those who have never seen the original are likely going to 
be just as disappointed. However, today's market means that 
producers can throw $55 million at a movie and theyll almost 
always make it back on DVD, even if box office sales tank.
The result is a glut of bland, boring movies that are barely 
worth a rental  movies like Aeon Flux that fail to move you 
anywhere except into another theater to watch a movie thats 
worth seeing.

AeonFlux fails to stun audiences

---------------------------------------------------

Pride and Prejudice proves itself
The new film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel breathes life into a classic love story
Anxious about finals? Is the Pittsburgh weather getting to 
you? Suffering from pre-holiday depression? You might be 
in need of something a little old-fashioned and a little gooey, 
with an unabashedly happy endingin which case, the new 
Pride and Prejudice is right up your alley.
The classic comedy of mismatched lovers has been going 
strong ever since Jane Austen first published her novel in 
1813. In the last decade, however, the story has been revis.ited a number of timeswith a modem and humorous twist 
in Bridget Jones' Diary, in the slightly misguided Bollywood 
incarnation Bride and Prejudice, and in the 1995 BBC mini
series, which starred Colin Firth as a wonderfully uptight 
Mr. Darcy and followed the book nearly line for line.
Austen has never looked better. This movie is set just a few 
years before the novel originally intended, at the tail end of the 
eighteenth century, and captures the natural beauty of the pe
riod. Everything looks fantastic  the landscapes, the.people, 
the clothes, the houses, even the food.
And in the midst of it all, Keira Knightley glows as the spunky 
Elizabeth Bennet. Knightley is a beauty with obvious brains 
and a sharp tongue. Herein lies a warning, however: as one of 
the films greater assets, Knightley is also its greatest liability. 
Theres just so much of her. Look at how daring she is, getting 
her skirts wet by tromping across that meadow! Look at how 
playfully flirtatious she can be! In my experience, there are 
two kinds of people: those who like Keira Knightley and those 
who can't stand her. If you fall into the latter category, this 
might not be the film for you.
Fortunately, I fall into the former, and with some exceptions, I 
thoroughly enjoyed her performance.
Also fortunate is the choice of Matthew MacFadyen as 
Mr. Darcy, Elizabeths nemesis and lover. MacFadyens Darcy
is incredibly handsome and an undeniable snob, but as the 
movie wears on, his outer layers peel away to show us a 
socially awkward, sensitive man whos too afraid of rejection 
to show his true colors. After Elizabeth informs him that he 
is the last man in the world that I could ever be prevailed 
upon to marry, the look on his face is alone worth the price 
of admission. Its evident that hes both taken with Elizabeth 
and terrified by her frankness  exactly as Austen intended 
him to be. No wonder Elizabeth decides to give him a second 
chance.
Although the other characters dont get quite as much screen 
time as they might deserve, they are all well executed. Simon 
Woods is endearing as Mr. Bingley, the suitor of Elizabeths 
older sister, Jane, who is played with grace by Rosamund 
Pike. As Elizabeths mother, Brenda Blethyn is shrill and 
flighty, but shes supposed to be, and Donald Sutherland gives 
her father both compassion and a wry humor. Dame Judi 
Dench puts in a cameo as Darcys aunt, the Lady Catherine 
de Bourgh, and her haughty righteousness makes her nephew 
seem like a puppy dog in comparison.
The sole disappointment was Mr. Wickham, the rake who 
lies to Elizabeth about his friendship with Darcy and then 
persuades her 15 year-old sister Lydia to elope with him.
There wasnt nearly enough time for Wickham, played here by 
Rupert Friend, to reveal either his charming side or his devi
ous side to the audience.
But its a small mark on an otherwise great film. There arent 
any real life lessons to be learned here, and the conclusion is a 
little mushy. But thats what makes it so great  when every 
other film views happy endings as cliched and an easy way 
out, this movie instead celebrates them, and with a consider
able amount of style.

It was made in 1967 and is by

Coming to America
Erika Lee questions the United States role in immigration
There was a quiet and intimate setting in Margaret Morrison 
Halls room 103 on Thursday. The weather may have been 
inclement, but not even a mechanical failure on Erika Lees 
plane, which managed to delay her arrival by a few hours, was 
going to ruin the evening.
Erika Lee, an associate professor in U.S. history at the 
University of Minnesota, received her Ph.D. in history from the 
University of California at Berkeley. Lee told how her primary 
research and teaching interests are in Asian American 
studies, immigration, comparative race and ethnicity, and 
20th-century American history. She is currently researching 
Asian immigration and exclusion in the Americas during the 
late 1880s through the 1940s.
The third of a series sponsored by H&SS, Lees presentation, 
"Asian Migration and National Identities in North America, 
1880s-1940s, stayed true to her recent research. For over 
an hour, she held her ground on the difficulties of the Asian 
migration into the United States, Mexico, and Canada during 
the turn of the century.
Separated into three distinct "episodes," the great Asian 
immigration into other countries was important to North 
America. The first episode, in the United States around the 
1870s, marked a time of fear and misunderstanding. Lees 
research notes Americas xenophobic mentality when it was 
popular to throw around the phrase "the Chinese are upon us" 
in the media. With the Exclusion Act following in six short 
years, America closed off to the Chinese, and Teddy Roosevelt 
even nicknamed the Pacific Fleet the Great White Fleet. 
John F. Kennedy would later remember this time in his 1960 
book, fittingly titled A Nation of Immigrants.
The second episode focused on Canada, facing the 
aftereffects of Americas gatekeeping: an influx of tumedaway immigrants. The public felt that the positive image of 
Canada was being lost in "non-white" immigrants  that 
some form of homogeneity in the nation was being thrown 
off-balance.
With the 1870s depression, the Chinese only served as a 
scapegoat, and a head tax was enforced. When the numbers 
refused to drop, the head tax rose from fifty, to a hundred, to 
five hundred dollars. Still, for every two white immigrants, 
there were three Chinese still willing to bear the burden of the 
head tax and live in Canada.
The final episode was in Mexico, in which the emphasis 
shifted from a "Whites versus Asian Mongols" mentality to a 
Western versus Eastern one. When the Chinese immigrated 
and took over the labor force Mexico wanted filled by 
Europeans, Mexico's government regulated the influx of the 
Chinese, harassing and pressuring them much as Canada did 
with its head tax.
By 1931, practically all of northern Mexico was cleared of 
Chinese immigrants. Lee said these events were far from 
coincidental: all 3 episodes linked by xenophobia.
This is a huge theme for scholars of migration, as it shows 
parallel and cooperative effort among the nations to form 
policies that supposedly protected their national security and
reduced socioeconomic problems. These policies, the effects 
of which are now felt by other minorities, were present since 
the great influx of Chinese immigrants.
Lee said the policies formed the same mentality in such 
different conditions. While the Chinese served as lackeys in 
Northern America, they served as the middle class of Mexico. 
The question session that followed also addressed hierarchi
cal xenophobia: the dominant white rhetoric kept Mexico 
out of the picture when the United States and Canada worked 
together on creating anti-immigrant policies.
If you missed this event and are interested in this topic, you 
can read Lees book, At America's Gates: Chinese Immigra
tion during the Exclusion Era, 1882-1943 (University of North 
Carolina Press, 2003). Lee explains how the Chinese exclu
sion laws transformed the United States into a "gatekeeping 
nation. At the heart of the book is the question of whether the 
United States is a nation of immigrants or a "gatekeeping" 
nation, one that is still hotly debated.

Everything from art to African beats
An overview of the ecletic concerts, events, and exhibits featured at the Warhol Museum
Looking for a place where you could find an African street 
band one week and an experimental film titled Instructions for 
a Light and Sound Machine the next? The Andy Warhol Mu
seum is ideal for anyone looking to catch up on contemporary 
art and popular culture.
Along with their extensive permanent collection (over 4000 
works), they feature special exhibits and events that you 
might never associate with CMUs famous avant-garde alum
nus.
Perhaps the biggest service that the museum provides is to 
promote blooming artists and bring this art culture to the 
city of Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, November 15, the museum 
featured an up-and-coming band called Konono No. 1. Konono 
No. 1 is a 12-piece African street band who made their Pitts
burgh debut after a European tour with the Chicago-based 
band Tortoise.
The night of their concert, the main lobby of the museum was 
packed with a truly diverse crowd of people ranging from ages
five to 65. It isnt every day that traditional Congolese music is 
performed for an urban crowd, so in order to preserve the tra
ditions of this music, the audience was asked to do something 
specific while watching the show: dance!
As soon as the music began, the lobby was transformed into 
a scene one might see at an outdoor caf on the streets of 
Kinshasa. Everyone (from the hippies to the rockers to the 
punks to the hip-hoppers) got into the groove. At one point 
a giant conga line formed around the lobby. As Chris May of 
AlIAhout Jazz.com says, They dont call this trance music 
for nothing. Played loud, like its meant to be, it will take you 
to another sphere." Sure enough, that crowd was nothing like 
the average Warhol crowd.
Konono No. 1 was formed 25 years ago on the Congo-Angolan 
bdrder with the intention to perform traditional music. The 
amplified limkebes, or thumb-pianos, rhythmic drum beats, 
and chants create a neo-traditional genre of kitashasa that 
musicians call tradi-moderne. The band incorporated these 
originally unwanted distortions with their roots in bazombo
trance music, producing an extremely unique style that has 
grouped them with the most experimental forms of rock and 
trance music.
If dancing to traditional African music isn't something that 
you are interested in, the Warhol Museum also offers other, 
lower-key events on a regular basis. Currently, there is an ex
hibit, running until January 8, titled Starf*cker: Andy Warhol 
and the Rolling Stones, which portrays Warhols close relation
ship with the Stones, especially Mick Jagger, and examines 
their song lyrics. There is also an exhibit, running through 
December 31, called General Idea Editions: 1967-1995. The 
museum also features additional unique works and installa
tions by General Idea. For a list of past and future exhibits 
(theyre already scheduled through the next year), check out 
the "Whats on link at www.warhol.org. With a huge array of 
concerts, exhibits, and performances, you are certain to find 
an event at the Warhol Museum that interests you.

Urinetown floods CMU
The School of Drama does justice to the Broadway masterpiece and then some
f by Matthew McKee | Staffwiiter
Since its Broadway premiere in 2001, the musical Urinetown 
has received joyous reviews, astonished sold-out theaters 
worldwide, and gained a reputation as a modern masterpiece. 
It earned three Tony Awards, two Obie Awards, and three 
Outer Circle Critics' Awardsbut most of all, ensembles 
across America have performed it over 1000 times.
Urinetown and its original choreographer have come to CMU 
for a run of glory. It showcases the School of Drama at its very 
best, and presents an exuberant realization of the modern 
musicals potential.
Carrafa and Cast
John Carrafa, who leads the ensemble in this enormous pro
duction, has worked on Urinetown since its very beginning. 
Carrafa, an alumnus of Bates College, wrote the original chore
ography used on Broadway and received a Tony Award nomi
nation for his work. His choreography also features moves 
from the musical Into the Woods and scenes from films such 
as The Thomas Crown Affair, The Last Days of Disco, and 
recently, The Polar Express. On television, Carrafa also worked 
on the choreography of Sex and the City. Carrafa has collabo
rated with famed director Mark Brokaw for The Long Christ
mas Ride Home, James Lapine on Into the Woods and John 
Rando on Urine-town. In short, Carrafa knows show business, 
and he brought to CMU a deep knowledge of its details.
"CMU has a really strong reputation in New York," said Car
rafa, and the actors proved themselves. Ive treated them like
pros. Rehearsals for the musical went at a professional pace, 
and at times he wanted to know if he moved too quickly. The 
actors assured Carrafa that they just wanted it to keep com
ing.
To give the students an insider's knowledge of the perform
ing world, Carrafa would often tell the drama students about 
Broadway and the business they would enter soon. John was 
very encouraging and helped to demystify Broadway for us a 
lot, said Dan Amboyer, who played Officer Lockstock and is a 
senior musical theatre major.
Carrafa was known for asking the actors their own thoughts 
on their work before giving his own feedback during rehears
als. Even though this marks the first time Carrafa has directed 
Urinetown, students praised his methods and advice.
"He has a dance background, and it works," said Rustin 
Davis, a senior production and technology management major 
and stage manager of this production. He came in knowing 
exactly what he wanted and let his plan evolve." Evolving this 
plan meant giving the students the liberty to try new things. 
Carrafa allowed the cast to experiment with the text and bring 
out a living, breathing play on stage and it proves dynamic 
and rewarding. Kate Cohen, production manager for Urinet
own and senior production and technology management 
major, said that even for the stage design, John let us start 
from scratch. He gave us a lot of freedom.
Little Sally actress Marissa Lesch, a senior musical theater 
major, said, "Johns just been so good to us. Its been so won
derful to work with him and be told that we were working at
the same level as the professionals.... He came in with open 
arms and was so warm. He wanted this to be our creation and 
didnt want to recreate what hed already done. Hes just been 
so generous with his knowledge."
Broadway Comes to CMU
With a director and a musical straight from the heart of Broad
way, the Purnell performance of Urinetown follows the same 
basic routine as the New York performance. The School of 
Drama has put up a cast of 21, larger than that of the Broad
way production. The dance numbers are larger and the stage 
busier for this run.
Further, Carrafa re-inserted some lines into the script not used 
before on stage. These small distinctions give this perfor
mance an easily recognizable personality.
On a larger scale, the Chosky theatre houses a more grand 
and convincing environment. Carrafa said that Broadway 
could never have hoped for such an amazing set. The lighting 
and stage truly do invite the audience to accept Urinetowns 
world, and feel like a part of the show.
From the very moment you walk from the Purnell lobby into 
the Chosky theatre, you step onto the threshold of a world that 
transcends reality, and even throws you a bit off-balance.
As a musical makes its run through the Broadway world and 
into its nationwide tour, its characters can start to become 
stale and too easily recognizable. But many of CMUs cast had 
not even seen a performance of the musical before they took
Caraffa allowed the students 
to design their own stage from 
scratch and exercise creative 
freedom with their designs.

the parts and adapted them to their visions.
They all have a fresh take on their roles, and what is played 
out on the stage works extremely well. The on-stage person
alities are explosive. Carrafa identified this and praised his 
cast for it, in his own words: 'Theyre all so strong in finding 
their own takes."
For instance, you will notice on stage a very lively and enter
taining Officer Barrel, played by Joseph Byrd, a junior musical 
theater major. Byrd thought up some of Barrels quips and ac
tions on the spot during rehearsals, giving his role a comedy 
that no one will repeat. Carrafa noted that all the actors have 
made the play their own, making this set of interpretations 
special. The style, subtleties, and charm of CMUs Urinetown 
all scream that this, indeed, is a unique and peerless take on 
the refreshing musical. "I doubt that any production will be 
better than this one," said Carrafa.
Comedy with a Kick
Urinetown will have you rolling with laughter, but the CMU 
cast tried very hard to understand the musical's strong social 
overtones and express those, as well. In the process of prepar
ing the musical, actors read through a packet of information 
on global resources and water management, themes that 
the musical comments on very heavily, potty-jokes aside.
The musicals somewhat dark ending provides bitter food for 
thought, and Davis agrees, "It hits the audience hard.
Matthew Gardiner, senior directing major and assistant direc
tor of the CMU production, said, If we just treated Urinetown 
as a big gag, the message wouldnt go through, but I think 
comedy in particular is one of the strongest ways to get a 
social message across.... It will work its way in through the 
laughter.
Everyone knows that Urinetown is funny, but what were 
trying to say is, 'If you waste and throw away what you have, 
youre not going to have a world for very much longer, said 
Timothy Wilson, senior musical theatre major and Bobby 
Strongs portrayer. Urinetown is much more than humor. The 
comedy is endless, but the writers just slid the message in 
effectively. I think they [the audience] keep that message, no 
matter what."

---------------------------------------------------

Wilson said, "John was adamant that its not about getting 
laughs ... Its about letting the audience experience who these 
people really are and experience their fascinating world."
Walking out of the theater and out of Uiinetown's world, that 
message does at least stick in the back of the audiences mind. 
The theme of unsustainable desire pervades the show and 
makes the audience begin to suspect the hopelessness of the 
situation. In a way, the musical acts as a call to action, but 
Uiinetown has not incited some great revolution in favor of the 
environmentalists.
However, as Hope Cladwell" actor and senior musical theatre 
major Johanna Brickey said, "Hopefully people will drive home 
and think about it and maybe change one little thing they do.... 
We could have a combined audience of about 2000; and if all ef 
them will do that, that's a lot of change.
An Ensembles Final Bow
For all of these senior students, Uiinetown marks one of the
highest points of their college career. The collaborative work 
they did with their colleagues makes for an astonishing per
formance, and the ensembles strength comes as more than 
the sum of its parts. Never did these students communicate 
any major trouble that had come up, and for a team of over 50 
creative minds, that shows an exemplary resilience.
The actors interviewedLesch, Brickey, Wilson, and Amboyer 
 said that the show came together at a rapid speed because 
of what Wilson called a "beautiful collaboration. Their visions, 
along with the visions of Gardiner, Davis, Cohen, and the rest 
of the team, meshed with Carrafas so well that Uiinetown flew 
onto the stage with amazing efficiency.
Obvious in Uiinetown's incredible performance is that confi
dence the cast has in each other. They sing and dance across 
the stage together with such uniformity, and their relationships 
seem genuine.
The love Wilson as Bobby and Brickey as Hope exchange bases 
itself in a strong personal bond that extends to real life, and
it becomes so apparent in this and other situations that the 
actors truly are a family. For the eight musical theater majors, 
college culminates in these performances. Brickey said, Its re
ally bittersweet. Its good to have something like this after four 
years of working so hard, but at the same time you know its 
never going to be like this again.

Paul Rusesabagina explains Hotel Rwanda
A powerful story about the murder of the Tutsi tribe and one mans struggle to save their lives
Like a little teapot, Paul Rusesabagina is short and stout.
When he walked onto the Soldiers and Sailors stage last 
Wednesday, an outsider might have thought the audience 
was applauding a Hall of Fame ex-quarterback and not the 
man best described as a modern-day Oscar Schindler.
Rusesabagina was brought to the University of Pittsburgh 
campus by groups united in combating global inequality: 
the Hillel Jewish University Center, the Black Action Society, 
Amnesty International, the African Student Organization, and 
the Ford Institute for Human Protection.
Rusesabagina (pronounced roo-sess-ah-bog-ee-nati) has 
gained notoriety from escaping a situation that, when it was 
occurring, hardly received any attention at all. In the spring of 
1994, nearly one million Rwandans were slaughtered in what 
later became a premier example of the world turning away 
from a country during its gravest hour.
Rusesabagina lived a peaceful life with his wife and three 
children amid the political turmoil that was ravaging their 
homeland. When the Hutu ethnic group began ruthlessly 
killing Tutsi residents, Rwanda had pitted neighbor against 
neighbor, brother against brother, and Rusesabagina began 
saving lives with the help of champagne and enough wads of 
cash to rival any mafia don.
As manager of the classy Milles Collines Hotel in the Rwandan 
capital of Kigali, Rusesabagina explained on Wednesday night 
that he was given plenty of opportunities to wine and dine 
with the most influential of Rwanda's visitors and tourists.
In the hotel were vaults that were stocked like the refrigera
tors on MTVs Cribs, replete with bottled whiskey and Cuban
cigars. But from April 12 to June 18,1994, Rusesabagina was 
not regaling the latest diplomat with these supplies; he was 
using them to bribe the soldiers sent to kill his guests.
Rusesabaginas hotel had become a haven for over a thou
sand Tutsi refugees, many of them children. Following leads 
on their location, Hutu soldiers repeatedly came to the hotel, 
machetes in hand, ready to exterminate the next generation 
of Tutsi Rwandans. Rusesabagina forged documents, called 
foreign leaders, and braved looking down a rifle's barrel daily 
to keep his tenants safe.
"Imagine hearing your own prime minister's detailing of her 
bodyguards death shortly before being killed herself, Rus
esabagina told the audience.
United Nations peacekeepers were on hand, but Rusesaba
gina is dismissive: They were disturbing witnesses to the 
carnage which they did nothing to stop.
Opening the event, Master of Ceremonies Eric Hartman 
relayed his hopes to the audience. Future generations cannot 
reflect on passivity  we must deny children the excuse," he 
said. Rusesabagina offered a chance to act and do just that.
One of Rwanda's neighboring countries, Congo, is providing 
material chilling enough to warrant a sequel to Hotel Rwanda, 
the film based on Rusesabagina's story. Rusesabagina ended 
his lecture with the expected Hallmark-esque message of 
hope, but he grew most passionate when referring to the 
massacres currently ravaging the continent. In the last eight 
years, "about 3.5 million people have been killed, Rusesaba
gina explained.
The conversation stayed political during Rusesabagina's 
question-and-answer session. His comment, "If Rwanda had
oil, the international community would have stepped in, 
garnered support from the audience.
Though his story was harrowing and his actions laudable, 
Rusesabagina's rendition failed to capture the audience the 
way his Oscar-nominated movie did. Although the 2000-seat 
auditorium was packed to standing room only, the audience 
could have used more standing ovations just to stay awake. 
Rusesabagina may look like the second-place finisher in a 
Danny Glover look-alike contest, but that wasn't enough to 
shake off the guess-you-sort-of-had-to-be-there stories and 
predictable pauses that pleaded for applause.
Everyone acknowledges the gift Rusesabagina has given to 
humanity. But while living through a tragedy is a one-way 
ticket to a CBS miniseries, it shouldn't be one onto the lecture 
circuit.

Check out Big Als favorite albums
The top ten best album stocklng-stuffers this holiday season for readers who love to rock
Courtesy of www.gigwise.com
Some of the bands that made the 
cut: From lop to bottom, Soulfly, 
Sepultura, and the Rolling Stones.
10. Jeff Scott Soto, Lost in the Translation
Classy hard rock for the Camaro driver in your family. Jeff's 
soulful vocals are the stuff of legend  whether recording 
with Queens Brian May, Journeys Neal Schon, or Yngwie 
Malmsteen, Jeffs voice is instantly recognizable. Perhaps its 
fitting that Jeff may have recently found a band to settle in 
with Soul Sirkus. Before you check them out, though, catch 
Jeff at his solo best here.
9. Constitution IV, Constitution of Treason
Metalcores first concept album! Just kidding, man. Seriously. 
These men were built for inflicting damage on audiences and 
naysayers alike. And dont call them metalcore anymore  at 
least not with this masterpiece. No matter your political bent, 
this is an album that appeals to metal fans the world over.
8. Sepultura, Roots  25th Anniversary Reissue
Dont let the title fool you  its only been a decade since 
one of my life-defining albums was released. From System of 
a Down to Limp Bizkit, all owe a debt to Max & co. Mixing 
tribal drums with blistering metal, this album was a return 
to their roots, whether Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Brasilian.
A second disc is included here with goodies like their cover 
of "Procreation (of the Wicked). If youve worn out your tape 
copy or just want to get an updated look at this work, pick up 
the reissue.
7. Soulfly, Soulfly  25th Anniversary Reissue
When he left Sepultura amid internal conflict and personal 
loss, Max Cavaleras future was uncertain. When he did 
decide to pick up his pen and instrument, he also picked up 
the thread left by Roots. Soulfly is an album that has stood the 
test of time, and helped to further establish the sub-genre of 
tribal/world metal. Pain and anger are two themes that work 
side by side here, but there is joy too.
6. Frameshift 2, An Absence of Empathy
First off, the frontman for this project is none other than 
Sebastian Bach of Skid Row. Still hitting the high notes, An 
Absence... finds the Baz in the role of many different people, 
all exploring the notions of violence and how our society 
presents it. Much more than the standard, cathartic aggro in 
metal, this is a coherently thought-out piece of work. Check 
out www.sebastianbach.com for four full demo songs off this 
release.
5. Killswitch Engage, Alive or Just Breathing  25th 
Anniversary Reissue/World Ablaze DVD
Okay, I know enough with the reissues, but if you like the new 
generation of American metal, the story of Killswitch Engage 
is a good one. From underground darlings a few short years 
ago to one of metals luminaries today, K.E. is an innovative 
band that mixes tight musicianship with pummeling live 
shows. And nowhere is that more evident than on their latest 
DVD, which features a show in their hometown of Worcester, 
Mass.
4. The Rolling Stones, A Bigger Bang
Putting on a rock spectacle is nothing new for the Stones. 
Jagger/Richards is a brand name when it comes to songwriting, and A Bigger Bang puts them nose to nose. The results 
are explosive. "Oh No., Not You Again and Rough Justice 
are two tracks that could have been on Some Girls, in my 
view. They're that good, ladies and gents.
3. Opeth, Ghost Reveries
On their latest album, Opeth manages to mix organs, deep 
lulls, angry voices, and throwbacks to Deep Purple and Thin 
Lizzy with the best of Swedish death. Hell, yeah. Just like Axl 
took the best of the Stones and the Sex Pistols and mixed it 
with the showmanship of Queen, Mikael Akerfeldt brings us 
to the next level of heavy musicianship.
2. Bruce Dickinson, A Tyranny of Souls
The Air Raid Siren continues the legacy of The Chemical 
Wedding with literate songwriting and stellar production. Iron 
Maiden fans rejoiced when he came back to the fold in 99, 
no doubt. But after two solid albums on his own, Bruce left 
us hungry for more. With a break in the Maiden tour cycle, 
Dickinson's latest is an excursion into the depths of his mind.
1. Roadrunner United, The All-Star Sessions
Every metal fans dream  and every musician's, too. Bring
ing the cream of all of Roadrunners lineup back to celebrate 
the labels 25th anniversary, an all-new album was created 
with four "team captains" from Machine Head, Fear Factory, 
Trivium, and Slipknot. On December 15, you can see this play 
out live in front of you at the Nokia Theater in Times Square. 
Some details are leaking out as we speak, and so far members 
of Sepultura, Machine Head, and others will be there. So will 
I, hopefully!
Have a wonderful break. Many thanks are in order to all who 
made this a semester to remember  first off is Amanda 
Flynn for her patient editing. On the industry side, thanks 
are due to Jensen and Maria at Adrenaline PR, George Vallee 
c Century Media, Dan Forman at Roadrunner, and Loana at 
Nuclear Blast. Gracias to all, and happy holidays.

It's almost the end of the year. Did you stick to this years resolutions? 
Does anyone even bother making them anymore? Perhaps you should 
try to improve yourself in the coming year...
Do you realize that if you sleep less, you can study more?
Today is an excellent day to make all those decisions youve been 
holding out on. Your planet is moving forward, which means your face 
may break out. The next few weeks are going to be difficult for you.
These coming weeks will prove to be a challenge; step up to the plate! 
Don't expect to do well in this challenge, though.
Pluto is in alignment with Saturn in the Second House. Mark my words, 
your cat is going to die within the next few years! Cherish what little time 
you have left together.
Just remember: no matter how badly you fail each of your classes, 
within a few weeks it will all be over.
Need another way to procrastinate? Go paintballing, make plans for 
winter break, sleep more, watch TV and movies, or just stare at your 
computer screen for hours on end. Good luck!
Studying has always been more important than showering. Next week 
you will truly come to value that fact. Don't worry; after the first few 
days, people won't notice the smell anymore.
The squirrels are getting desperate. They don't have enough acorns 
to last them the winter. Dont you live near a lot of squirrels? They like 
Sagittarius blood; take a few bodyguards with you when you leave your 
building. Especially at night.
You will finally discover why someone has been awfully mean lately. 
Perhaps this person is you. Eating lots of cake and cookies sure does 
help relieve stress, doesnt it?
That special feeling of happiness comes from incessant use of WoW, 
snow, and denial of the immediate future.
Something shiny will have you entranced for hours today. And 
tomorrow, actually. Some stars are suggesting that you spend your time 
more wisely, but do as you see fit.
