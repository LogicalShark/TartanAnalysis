Carnegie Army-Civilian Canteen 
Thronged by Fun-Hungry Teehites
Old timers may have bemoaned the fact that campus life just aint 
what it used to be, but the Hut upset this popular tune last week by as
suming the role that it had over 25 years agoservicemens canteen. De
signed to serve as a common meeting place for both civilians and Army 
Specialized trainees, it has already become Carnegies chief social center. 
The Canteen already has achieved importance because it represents tjie 
first attempts of a local college to mix its civilian students and men in 
uniform.
Under New Plan ASTP 
Trainees Now Work On 
Regular Tartan Staff
This issue of the Carnegie Tartan 
marks the maturing of the Carnegie 
A. S. T. units. The Army is here 
primarily to study specialized sub
jects, but also takes its place in the 
life and activities which are an im
portant part of an institution such 
as this.
Now the Army has its own section 
of the Tartan. The AST men, while 
actually students, have held back 
from the normal beat of the college 
life which surrounds them. Natural
ly, there is a slight matter of disci
pline. Time rationing is still an
other problem. However, in many 
respects this separation has not 
been so definite as it might have 
been. Army men are taught by the 
professors of the civilian students. 
They have translated Beanery in
to Mess Hall, Dormitory into 
Barracks (complete with restric
tion on all except military person
nel), and Hut into Canteen. In 
other respects, Tech has seen its 
very makeup changed, but only into 
a military version of its peacetime 
self.
Now, in a conclusive effort to pro
mote the oneness between military 
and civilian, AST has taken over 
one-half of the Tartan. This assign
ment is a serious one, and the men 
are determined to treat it as such. 
Each and every member of AST at
C. I. T. realizes that he is a mem
ber in the best standing at this insti
tution. He, therefore, is determined 
to do his best. A few. of the soldiers 
have been selected to operate di
rectly as functioning members of 
the Tartan editorial staff. They are 
expected to maintain the former

Original Play Program Is 
Initial Drama Production
Starting Monday, January 17, and 
continuing for three days the Pitts
burgh public and Tech students are 
going to have a chance to see some
thing they havent seen for years  
some original plays written by stu
dents in the Drama Department. 
These plays have not only been 
, written by the students, but also 
have been directed and designed by 
members of the department. The 
directors, who designed the shows 
also, are seniors who are majoring 
in directing. The authors are stu
dents of play-writing under Mr. Kai 
Heiberg-Jurgensen.
The first play on the program is 
Concerto, written by Ruth Fisher 
rvand directed by Lois Nosich with 
r Julianne Stansbury as stage mana, ger. Concerto is the story of a child 
prodigy on the night of his first pub
lic concert.
j And Be My Love by Phyllis Leon 
^vil| be presented next. This play, 
directed by Marianne Brown, is a 
sophisticated comedy of manners. 
t Patricia Turtin is the stage manager 
j for this one.

New Cadet System 
Adopted In ASTP
Replacing the original policy of 
rotating all cadet offices among the 
trainees,' a system calling for per
manent cadet officers and non-com
missioned officers has been intro
duced in the A.S.T.P. at Tech. 
Trainees have been selected for 
these positions on basis of leader
ship and previous experience.
Regimental commander and sen
ior cadet officer is Sergeant Studebaker of company C. Pfc. Rice, 
company D, has been appointed 
regimental adjutant. Pvt. Ford, 
company A, and Pvt. Goosens, com
pany E, command the two battallions, while Cpl. Veale, company B, 
and Pvt. Allcorn, company F, have 
been designated as battalion adju
tants. The seven trainees appointed 
as company commanders are: Pvt. 
Seaton of company A, Cpl. OBrien 
of company B, Cpl. Hedlund of com
pany C, Pfc. Colbertson of company
D, Pvt. Biancetta of company E, 
Pvt. Overberg of company F, and 
Pvt. Bunday of company R.
Arm bands bearing the insignia 
of rank are worn by all cadet lead
ers. The cadet non-coms wear the 
regulation stripes corresponding to 
their ranks. The insignias of the 
various cadet officers are: platoon 
leaders, two white bars; campany 
commander and battalion adjutant, 
three white bars; regimental ad
jutant and battalion commander, 
one gold bar; and regimental com
mander, three gold bars.
Replete with juke-box, pinball 
machines and an ample supply of 
refreshments in the form of ice 
cream, candy, cokes and cookies, the 
Canteen provides both a lounge and 
a dance floor for everyones enjoy
ment. In addition to the refresh
ments, a limited line of drug pro
ducts are on sale.
Mrs. Pearl Barr, former Assistant 
Manager of the Inn and a familiar 
figure on campus for over ten years, 
is in charge of the Canteen. Having 
recently returned from Camp Eustis, Virginia, where she served at 
the PX for 27 months, this genial 
hostess feels that she now knows 
something about army life! 
According to Mr. L. H. Miller, 
Supervisor of Equipment, who was 
directly in charge of converting the 
home of Samuel Johnson and his 
colleagues into a recreation center 
for Johnny Doughboy, the Canteen 
will be constantly undergoing im
provements and any suggestions 
dropped in the box for that pur
pose will be considered. Mr. Miller 
admits with a knowing grin that 
some of the proposals that he has 
received are sometimes not quite 
within reason, yet others have re
sulted in the installation of a tele
phone in the PX as well as the ad
dition of some AST stationery.
Though the PX has been open 
only for a week, Carnegie students 
and soldiers have formed some pret
ty definite opinions on it already. As 
anyone will tell you, Its swell, but 
one thing is wrongit should have 
been opened sooner.
Tau Delts Hold 
invitation Dance
The Tau Delta Phi Fraternity will 
hold an informal invitation dance in 
the Urban Room of the William 
Penn Hotel at 9 oclock, Saturday, 
January 15.
Invitations have been sent to Car
negie Tech men only; three hundred 
couples are expected to attend the 
dance. The Tau Delts expect to es
tablish this dance as an annual cus
tom for the other fraternities to 
take up and support. The Kappa 
Sigs began this practice on a small
er basis, by inviting each year a few 
members of each fraternity. The 
Tau Delts have enlarged upon this, 
making many changes in the usual 
manner of presenting Tech dances. 
Instead of the customary Schenley 
Hotel, the dance is being held at 
the William Penn Hotel, and Joey 
Simms orchestra instead of Brad 
Hunts or Bernie Armstrongs band. 
This dance is going to be something 
new in campus events, and the Tau 
Delts plan to make it popular.
Joey Simms orchestra will pre
sent a program of popular music, 
with a vocalist to give the dance 
some variety. Marty Miller, Tau 
Delta Phis social chairman, prom
ises that the dance will be bang-up 
affair. It will start a new dance and 
a new custom which he hopes will 
be continued from now on as the 
first school dance of each new year.
Tom Bokman To Head 
New Scottie Staff
The new Scottie staff for 1944 has 
been announced as follows: Editorin-chief  Tom Bokman, Assistant 
EditorJanet Armstrong, Business 
ManagerDick Bingham, Exchange 
Editor  Malcolm Festenstein, Cir
culation ManagerMillard Stewart.
Tom Bokman, junior, prom
ises big things from the Scottie 
this year. Not only does he prom
ise us a bigger and batter publica
tion but also a more artistic one 
he has planned a cover which he 
described as fuji bleed with a red 
over print and it is certain to catch 
the eye. The idea to sell the Janu
ary 25th issue of the Scottie as the 
program at the basketball game list
ing the names, numbers, and fac
tors of all the players is an innova
tion.
The assistant editor, Janet Arm
strong, General Studies senior, is 
also the managing editor of the 
Thistle. Both she and Tom are 
members of Pi Delta Epsilon. The 
Circulation Manager, Millard Stew
art, is the only one from the old 
staff who continues in the same 
position. Malcolm Festenstein, Ex
change Editor, is a member of Pi 
Delta Epsilon, ACAC, and plays on 
the basketball team.
AH in all, the new staff is in 
agreement on the policy of a bigger 
and better Scottie in 44.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1944
The Outlook . . .
Filling The Canteen
At long last Carnegie AST men have received their Canteen. Much 
time, labor, and loss of free moments have been spent on the part of volun
teers in removing the crowded shelves and their knowledge-filled contents 
from the hut. Previous to this step, much complaining by the soldiers who 
felt that they were shamefully ignored and deprived of some of their rights 
as members of the Armed Forces had made it felt almost painfully that 
morale was unnecessarily low. Negotiations w*ere made, supplies were ar
ranged for, a staff was provided, and the entire library was moved en 
masse to the former Personnel Office. This latter step again necessitated 
rearrangement of Military Department offices, scattering of facilities and 
units, and the services of a staff of carpenters. The fact that the soldiers 
themselves provided the labor needed to move the volumes to their new 
location proved their readiness to work for their Canteen.
In the meantime, the old Hut had undergone changes which had 
turned it into something at least as good as any PX any of the men had 
ever known. Refreshments minus only 3.2 were present, rooms for card 
playing were provided, and even a dance floor was at hand. The soldiers, 
true to their word, flocked in. Then something did not begin to happen.
Carnegie girls, entering the Canteen with the wish of carrying out 
one feature of the new institution, namely, the bringing about an im
provement of social relations between Army and civilians, found them
selves received rather strangely. Their efforts to break the well-known 
ice were met in a manner which made it seem that the men had taken 
that ice on their own shoulders. Invitations to play cards, to dance, simply 
to chat were ignored without comment simply ignored. A timid request 
that several of the fellows pose for dance floor pictures brought one enter
prising young lady an almost brutal rejection, until in desperation, she had 
to resort almost to bribery to secure a few rather meager shots.
What is wrong? Something, obviously. Is it timidity, bashfulness, a 
sudden feeling of stand-offishness, or a desire to appear as strong silent 
types, which has suddenly possessed the Army? These tendencies might 
better be displayed in ranks, while in formation, or marching to and from 
classes, when usually the exact opposite is only too evident. Why not 
loosen up, enjoy the Canteen, take advantage of the pleasures and oppor
tunities for relaxation which it offers, and thus display appreciation of it? 
Students are sincerely trying to do their bit to make the Canteen a success. 
Their efforts have not been well received, to date.
Lets do something about this. We can be at once selfish and unselfish 
by merely being friendly. Lets fill the Canteen with a real spirit! A.V.P.
The Welcome Mat Is Out
We are happy to welcome to our fold fifteen A. S. T. P. students who 
will work with the existing civilian staff in an attempt to make The Tartan 
a truly representative Carnegie Tech publication. We join the Army 
and the administration in the fervent hope that this will be a step to the 
right, that is, a means of giving the soldier students publicity that they, as 
students enrolled on this campus, merit, and a direct aim at fostering 
Army-civilian relationships. If this project is successful it is hoped by all 
parties concerned that it will open the way to soldier participation in all 
campus activities. This, however, will depend entirely on the way in 
which this bigger and, we pray, better Tartan is supported by the 
A. S. T. P.
IN MEMORlAM
The Carnegie Tartan wishes to express its sorrow at the passing of 
Miss Ethel Ruthrauff, editor of the Official Publications and the Fac
ulty Bulletin, and to extend the sympathies of the staff to those she has 
left behind. Since 1919 Miss Ruthrauff has been affiliated with the Car
negie Institute of Technology. First she served as secretary" to the late 
Dr. Thomas S. Baker and then as secretary to President Doherty from 1936 
to 1937. In 1937 she was appointed head of the Official Publications, a 
position she held up to the time of her death. Before coming to Carnegie, 
Miss Ruthrauff taught school, engaged in newspaper work, did publicity 
work at Tome School, Port Deposit, Md., and was secretary at the Ely 
School for Girls in Greenwich, Conn. She received an A. B. degree from 
Western Maryland College in 1905. Carnegie will sincerely miss the good 
work of Miss Ruthrauff and regret her loss for a long time to come.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

A new year has begun, and with 
its advent many things have 
changed. We are progressing on 
the road to victorywith leaps and 
bounds in Europe, slowly but surely 
on the Pacific. The Teheran talks 
mark a new step towards a stable 
post-war structure. In this country 
also progress has been made in the 
fight against reaction, for a better 
world after this war. Yet there are 
many sore spots left, many things-to 
be improved before democracy is 
really established here, but para
mount among these difficulties is 
the labor problemand it will re
main thus unless we give it some 
serious thought.
In the first eleven months of 1943, 
labors anti-strike pledge was 
broken more than 3500 times by 
strikes and walkouts. Almost ten 
times every day factories and shops 
were closed or crippled because of 
some grievance, and an appalling 
amount of man-hours were lost. 
Why was this? Certainly it was not 
conducive to the war efforteach 
hour lost means a proportionate 
lengthening of the waryet our 
workers are as American as any of 
us; they too have sons and brothers 
in the armed forces; they too want 
this war to end as soon as possible.
The answer to the labor problem 
is as difficult as it is important. One 
is as wrong in condemning labor 
completely as one would be in de
fending it in all its actions. We 
must try to consider all sides of the 
question; only then can we hope to 
arrive at a just solution.
Labor today faces a dilemma. The 
workers want their boys to return 
as' soon as possible, yet they do not 
want them to find a world in which 
they cannot make a decent living. 
They know that by striking they 
delay the cessation of hostilities, but 
if they sit by while prices soar their 
sons will come back to face starva
tion. They work and smash one 
production record after another; 
they pay higher prices for food and 
clothing, higher taxes; they buy 
bondsbut their wages are frozen, 
and the corporations are the only 
ones to make profits, millions upon 
millions. There is no help from the 
government: Congress bungles
along without being able to enforce 
price ceilings, unwilling to grant 
subsidies. There is an Anti-strike 
Bill for labor, but no law to curb 
the profits of business.
Labor is caught between short
term and long-term patriotism. If 
they protest against the rising costof-living they are denounced by 
friends and foes alike as traitors, as 
men willing to sacrifice their coun
try to their own needsyet if they 
help to win this war sooner by toler
ating all the injustice done to them 
they know that they will surely 
lose the peace. E. A. L.
Letter To The Editor
In the last issue of the Tartan, 
senior interviews, taken in a quick, 
haphazard way, appeared in print; 
and the effect was shocking to both 
the students and the faculty. These 
graduating seniors, of which I was 
one, said some things which we all 
know should be straightened out, 
and which we all want straightened 
out.
As I said, the interviews were 
given in a light, haphazard .manner 
at lunch time, and the pictures were 
also taken then. These interviews 
were in no case taken down verba
tim, and in many cases they are ab
solute fiction according to those in
terviewed.
However, one thing must be made 
clear. If any of these criticisms 
were really made from the heart, 
and Im sure they were not, these 
criticisms were not in any way 
made against the secretarial depart
ment. Because all the girls inter
viewed were from this department, 
many seemed to gather from the 
column which appeared in the Tar
tan that the students thought little 
of their department. This is the 
farthest possible from the truth. We 
would not trade ours for any de
partment in the school. Perhaps we 
might have a little trouble with 
shorthand the first year, most peo
ple do have a hard time when start
ing something new, but we are 
taught well, and any difficulty 
which may come upwhether it is 
school work, home problems, or love 
life, can be and is discussed by the 
Secretarial Faculty.
Perhaps the best thing to do to 
straighten out the whole occurrence 
is to try to give you my real feeling 
after spending three and one-half 
years at Tech, and which, I believe 
may be considered to be the opinion 
of all the seniors. This is not a
spur-of-the-moment interview; it is 
my idea and my feelings after 
thinking over just what these years 
have meant to me. First, they have 
been fun. We have all made 
friends, which is one of the most 
important things in life. One of the 
best semesters I spent in school was 
last summer (despite eight oclock 
classes about which, of course, we 
griped good - naturedly) because 
everyone was so friendly. Second 
we have had to do our work; but 
one must work hard to attain any 
goal and to do anything worth 
while. I think most of us have 
learned how to work. Third, I have 
had experience in organizations; 
and I have worked downtown one 
day a week this past semester. Tech 
has meant Skibo, the Beanery, 
the Grill and Inn, the Union, 
Spring Carnival, Junior Prom, 
hard-fought football games but 
never being ashamed of it because 
of the wonderful spirit of the team,

1
one of the girls ur Sincerest Sympathies
When I heard that I was going to 
interview a Senior Household Eco
nomics major, I had visions of myIf four years latera dumpy lit
tle speciman with hair in her eyes, 
no makeup, and a yummy order of 
stale apple pie and burnt bacon 
emanating from her slightly starch
ed white uniform. I looked forward 
to a distinctly ghoulish interview. 
But when I discovered that the gal 
to be questioned was the charming 
Louisa Saul, my spirits lifted con
siderably. I found the tall, blonde,
blue eyed Louisa lunching in the 
Inn with a happy mob of her Alpha 
Epsilon Phi sorority sisters. Being 
a newspaper woman herselfonly 
the second woman editor to be 
elected in the history of the Tartan 
she understood my difficulties and 
very graciously endured the third 
degree I gave her and since she is 
my boss I really had to make it 
tough.
As I pursued my inquiry, I dis
covered that Louisa is one of the 
most versatile as well as the most 
popular Seniors on the Carnegie 
campus. She cant decide whether 
her greatest interest lies in cook
ery or writing, but shes keeping 
her fingers in both pies for the pres
ent until she decides. She loves to 
writenewspaper stories, skits, and 
both the words and music to songs. 
She can play the piano, too. In the 
household economics field, Louisa 
has done a lot of interesting things. 
Last summer she spent six weeks 
as a galley slave working in the
New Plays
Continued, from Page 1 
Connor is a folk play dealing with 
country people in the hinterlands 
of Pennsylvania. Ruth Storm di
rected Caleb Connor and Rachel 
Hansen is the stage manager.
The last play will be Katherine 
Daviss Take Two, Theyre Small di
rected by Adeline Roth. This farce 
deals with the current American 
scene, commenting on everything 
from the draft to vitamin pills. The 
stage manager for this one is Lois 
Eicher.
These plays will be given in the 
Little Theatre on January 17, 18, 
and 19 starting at 8:20. Tickets are 
available in the main office of the 
Drama Department and in the Reg
istrars Office in the Administration 
Building.
. . . Louisa Saul
Taylor Allderdice' High School 
Cafeteria doing my students train
ing where my starched white 
uniform gave me just enough pres
tige to mop floors. Later in the 
summer, our little dietician had con
siderably more fun as a student die
tician at Montefiore Hospital where 
she held all the patients hands 
(rumor has it that there was a 
slight shortage of interest). The 
summer before, she took care of five 
brattish infants whom she shephered to and from the country club 
day after day. Well, you got a sun
tan anyway, dear. After her grad
uation in April, our editor will in
tern at one of the larger hospitals 
preferably out of Pittsburgh in 
either Chicago or New York.
Here at Carnegie, Louisa is first 
and foremost Editor of our wonder
ful (Hummm! Hummm!) Tartan 
and then Chapter Editor of Alpha 
Epsilon Phi which recently grew up 
from Mu Alpha Gamma when the 
girls of the M. M. C. C. Sorority 
went national a couple of months 
ago. Incidentally, Louisa is one of 
the charter members of Mu Alpha 
Gamma, was its first and second 
president and has written several of 
the sorority songs. The sorority 
just couldnt live without me, Miss 
Saul said laughingly, but from what 
some of the girls tell me her joking 
statement was not so far from the 
truth. She is secretary of the pub
lications committee, member of Pi 
Delta Epsilon, the journalistic hon
orary fraternity, and belonged to the 
girls journalistic honorary Alpha Xi 
Alpha before it merged with PiDE. 
Until this semester when her many 
activities almost overwhelmed her, 
she was also a member of the Wom
ans Glee Club.
Of course I asked Miss Saul the 
usual questions about her ideal man, 
her pet hates, her most embarrass
ing moment, and her opinions of 
wartime Tech. Here are her an
swers in a nutshell. The Ideal Man 
must be at least six feet tall and 
unrepulsive looking. He must 
have a terric sense of humor, be a 
stimulating conversationalist and a 
smooth dancer. She doesnt want 
much does she? Speaking of men, as 
who isnt, Louisa really hit a snag 
the other night. She thought she 
had discovered her Ideal Male in a 
Pitt ASTP, but she discovered at 
twelve midnight that he was mar
ried. As you can plainly see she 
hasnt met her ideal male yet. Nat
urally when she does, she plans to 
get married but she really dislikes 
hypocritical people and people who 
dont hand assignments in on time. 
Her fondest memories will be of the 
Tartan and her sorority; she got her 
biggest thrills when she was elect
ed editor of the aforementioned 
publication and when she was ini
tiated into the aforementioned na
tional sorority.
Louisa has been too busy to be 
affected much by the changes on 
the Wartime campus but she does 
miss the vanished traditions. She 
thinks the Canteen is a wonderful 
idea but that the huts atmosphere 
seems a little chilly since it has been 
converted.
Altogether Louisa like Carnegie a 
great deal in war or peace and Im 
sure the feeling is mutual.
Freshman Social Relations is 
dead, or at least in a coma. There 
has long been a fight to get some
thing like our Soc. Rel. program 
taught in technical schools. We are 
now engaged in a great civil war to 
test whether this program, or any 
program so conceived and so dedi
cated can long endure.
The passing of C-701-2 was not 
premeditated; it came with the 
change from a civilian college with 
an army section to an army college 
with a civilian section. The class 
entering May, 1943, kissed the two 
courses good-bye on behalf of the 
Engineers for the duration (and six 
months?) Now that the smoke of 
battle has cleared and the comatose 
body has been removed, an autopsy, 
or perhaps vivesection, can be per
formed.
Soc. Rel. is one of those courses 
which you are indifferent or antag
onistic to when it means six or nine 
units on your program but grow to 
appreciate after its all over. Per
3
haps someone primarily interested 
in metaphysics draws an economics 
prof, or a brutally practical engi
neer listens to two lectures a semes
ter on the meaning of truth. In oth
er cases some budding young psy
chology student ate up talks on 
right is what want to do. The 
Dewey article was admittedly dif
ficult, but some students found it 
easier than proving that the stage
coach meant the breakdown of so
cial standards in England.
In any event, the king is dead. 
Schedules now prosaicly list history 
and geography where subjects in
tended to develop higher social 
consciousness formerly appeared. 
We no longer read that science is 
God; deductive and inductive rea
soning no longer struggle to control 
the world; and the law of supply 
and demand no longer requires that 
the price of eggs in Podunk be a 
pertinent topic. Simple, dull, and 
intellectual tools alike can rest.

^al&L in KkcJu
By Jerry BrickmanLook At It This Way
By The Infantry Journal
With the new year 1944 come re
ports of new achievements made by 
Tech men in the armed forces.
From the Office of Public Rela

In some ways the soldier who has 
been selected for A.S.T.P. may feel 
that he is out of things. He worked 
like the devil for months to learn 
how to fight. And then, because he 
has some brains he is ordered back 
to school.
The shift from the Army camp to 
the school room is an abrupt one. 
It hardly seems to make sense un
less the probable continuing need 
for men of education as leaders and 
specialists in tomorrows Army is 
held in mind. The emphasis on 
studies with an indirect military ap
plication, the turn from intensive 
physical work to intensive mental 
work, the knowledge that other 
hundreds of thousands of men are 
joining their regiments or going di
rectly overseas as replacements 
these things all help you to feel that 
the war is passing you by, that you 
will never get the chance to fight.
You had learned a lot about fight
ing, and you were all for applying 
this knowledge where it would do 
the most goodwhen the schoolbell 
rang for you again.
Those who laid the plans for 
ASTP could only be thinking about 
the greater needs of the Army. You 
can be certain that you never would 
have been picked out of several mil
lion men and sent to school unless 
there were a need for men of your 
caliber already apparent. It may be 
a gripe to read what soldiers al
ready fighting in the war theaters 
are accomplishing toward victory 
while you are sitting in class. But 
you belong to this war every bit a? 
much as they do, and the thing th 
you can help most by doing is 
tackle your assignments with < 
same will with which the others are 
tackling the German or Jap.
The war is not likely to end be
fore you finish school or for a long 
time after that. It could, conceiv
ablyif you can imagine ten mil
lion German officers and soldiers, 
and the millions of Hitlers Second 
Army who hold the German people 
in line, suddenly quitting and let
ting the Allied Forces through to 
Berlin. Or it could if you can 
imagine several million fanatical 
Japs, who actually believe that they 
are better fighting men than any 
American soldier, with an unques
tioning nation behind them almost 
as big in population as ours-if you 
can imagine such people folding up 
in the middle of their war. Yes, the 
war could end, right soonif these 
things happened.
But bet on the date if you want to, 
and then forget it. The war isnt 
over, and your military job isnt 
over until it is. And maybe not even 
then, if this world is in a state of 
continual watchfulness for some 
time after.

Theta Tau Award The Latest Varsi*y sPort 
Goes To R. Dodds
At the graduation exercises in 
December, Robert M. Dodds, C. E. 
*>43, was chosen the outstanding en
gineer by Theta Tau, Carnegie 
0ifechs only professional engineer
ing society. Bofe Dodds story is 
one of success; hardworking and 
ambitious, he has accomplished 
what every engineer hopes for. Dur
ing his undergraduate years, Dodds 
never missed the honor roll, and in 
his senior year succeeded in acquir
ing a 4.00 factor. He was a Techsport and feature editor of the 
Technical. He was elected to the 
Vice-Presidency of Tau Beta Pi and 
was treasurer of Theta Tau last 
year. In addition to these responsi
ble positions, he is the president of 
ASCE. His fraternities, including 
honoraries, are Theta Xi, Alpha Phi 
Omega and Phi Kappa Phi.
Bob hails from Omaha, Nebras
ka, is 22 and married. He is now 
teaching mechanics at Tech. His 
favorite class, by his own request, 
is his class of Westinghouse girls. 
(When Bob goes home to his wife 
every night, his wife receives a first
hand report of the class work in 
the course.)
As for teaching, Bob says, Its 
just fine. He is teaching element
ary surveying and hydraulics as 
well as mechanics. He loves to 
watch the expressions on pupils 
faces when a test is announced.
Bob came to Tech because he 
heard it was the best engineering 
school in the country. But he 
didnt start out as a civil  he be
gan as an architect, but soon chang
ed to Civil Engineering. Yes, Bob 
Dodds was busy during his fresh
man year tooas president of the 
freshman class!

Included in any group of men 
from the Armed Forces are a cer
tain number of individuals who are 
of more than usual interest to their 
fellows. It is impossible, of course, 
to Have been a member of the Arm
ed Service in time of war without 
developing a little history. But what 
of those with pasts not devoid of 
glamor? What of men who have 
known those who today stir his
torys cauldron?
For example, the Area and Lan
guage section of Carnegies ASTP 
unit forms no more than six per
cent of the total unit. Yet, within 
its several small divisions are men 
who have sung Le Marsellaise in 
the ranks of the Foreign Legion. An 
ex-officer candidate of the Spanish 
Republican Army marches to mess 
beside a young man whose first ex
perience with drill was with Hit
lers goose-stepping army. A man 
who knew Mitchell, inventor of the 
Spitfire, Englands and democ
racys noble friend. There is an
other who, but for an age techni
cality, would now be serving, in all 
probability, with his comrades of the 
Canadian forces in Italy.
If such is true of the minute lan
guage section, how much must it be 
j so of the Engineers, who form the 
other 94%? It will be the purpose 
of this column to bring such inter
esting examples of Carnegies ASTP 
men to the notice of all.

On behalf of all the graduating 
seniors may I give a word of advice 
to underclassmen. Never permit 
yourself to be quoted in any form 
of print until you have completely 
thought out the matter on which 
you are to comment and written it 
out so it can be quoted exactly. You 
will then have nothing to regret, to 
be ashamed of, or to be sorry for. 
Take Tech to heart; you will miss it 
when youre through just as we all 
know we shall and love your school; 
we do. We really do.

Tech Enrolls Appreciable 
Number of Students
Monday and Tuesday, January 5 
and 6. 1097 students from all the 
schools of Carnegie Tech registered 
for the coming semester. During the 
rest of last week the enrollment for 
the semester beginning January 5 
was brought to a total of 1121 stu
dents as reported by E. K. Collins, 
Registrar. The enrollment for the 
various schools is as follows: Col
lege of Engineering 464, College of 
Fine Arts 257, Margaret Morrison 
382, Carnegie Library School 18.
As compared with the enrollment 
of the semester of May 1943 with 
the beginning of the expedited plan, 
there has been a definite decrease in 
the enrollment which is mainly due 
to present day conditions.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1944
SPORTS
Tech Versus Pitt At Stadium; 
Record Unbroken6 StraightS
OLDIER 
PORT
***?OLDI
The purpose of this column is to 
give fitting recognition to the teams, 
organizations, and individual play
ers of the various companies. In the 
past, these efforts of hard-working 
companies and regimental teams 
have received little or no real back
ing or publicity. Soldier Sports 
Slants will provide both space and 
opportunity for A.S.T. athletics, in 
general, and their small vital 
phases, in particular, to become 
known to their fellows. YOUR com
pany is of interest to all, and vice 
versa.
The most important thing this 
week in the sports-for-the-soldiers 
program is the progress of the Com
pany Basketball League. The race 
is on, and it will be a good one. Your 
editor went to a couple of the games 
last week, and he saw the spirit 
with which the boys played. They 
werent playing for glory or for 
money. They were out for the fun 
of the game. They were playing for 
their company. The boys played 
very hard.
A fine spirit of sportsmanship has 
been developed in the teams by 
these games. The boys on one team 
are getting to know the fellows 
from the other teams. A little 
friendly jibing has arisen b^ause 
of the competition. All these things 
are wholesome  they are benefi
cial  they are American!
One thing noticed at the games 
was the lack of support on the part 
of the fellows from the respective 
companies. There were few specta
tors. Despite this fact, the boys 
were in there giving all they had. 
Imagine what they could do if they 
had some one out there verbally 
patting them on the back.
Lets go, you company men  lets 
get out there and support our teams!
Regimental Cagers Fight 
Hard Spring Matches
The Regimental Cagers have lin
ed up a hard January schedule with 
a grouping of top-notch opponents. 
Some of these tilts will be played 
in conjunction with the Tartans in 
double-header meets. The latter in
clude games with: Westinghouse
apprentice School (Skibo vs, Penn 
State) at Pitt, February 5; and with 
Camp Reynolds (Tech vs. Case) at 
home, February 12. Single games 
will be played with W & J A.S.T.P. 
at home, January 15, with Centre 
Avenue Y.M.C.A. at the Y, Janu
ary 19, with W & J A.S.T.P. on en
emy ground, January 22, and with 
Westminster also on foreign terri
tory, February 5. There is an inter
esting home game for January 26 
with an opponent to be announced 
later.
The Sports Staff of The Car
negie Tartan wishes to extend its 
deepest sympathies to James 
Okey Montague, .former sports 
editor of the Tartan, who entered 
the Armed Services of the U. S. 
early this year.
Last Wednesday, January 5, the 
Tech Five started its sixth game 
of the present season when it met 
Pitt, playing the game at the Pitt 
stadium. Pitt being a larger school 
and having more reserves on which 
to draw was favored to win. Pitts 
record previous to this game was 
also better than that of Tech as they 
had only two loses out of two games 
played while Carnegie had lost each 
of their first five.
The game, however, was no run
away affair for the Panthers, at 
first. At the end of the first quarter,* 
after evenly matched plajdng by 
both the teams, the score stood tied 
at twelve all. The second quarter 
saw Walt Jones come in for Pitt to 
spark their offensive drive, and a 
total of 23 points racked up for Pitt. 
Tech was not idle during this time, 
but scored four points. The score at 
the half (for the benefit of the Arts 
and Dramat students) was: Pitt -
35, Tech - 16.
This lead was too much for our 
fighting five to overcome and they 
were outscored in the second half 
28 to 17 so that the final score (again 
for the benefit of the Arts and Dra
mat students) was: Pitt - 63, Tech - 
33.
At the scheduled time for the 
start of the second half the referees 
were nowhere to be found. (It was 
later discovered that they had lost 
track of the time and were waiting 
in their dressing room.) To avoid 
delay the team coaches took over 
the posts of the referees and the 
game went on, but as the score in 
the half stood at two to two when 
the referees finally made their ap
pearance, it was disregarded, and 
the half started over. So Tech was 
able to preserve its record of no 
victories.
But seriously, Tech has a good 
basketball team. The Carnegie In
stitute is primarily an engineering 
college, and while many other engi
neering schools throughout the 
country have been forced to do 
away with athletics for the dura
tion, Tech is maintaining many of 
her teams  football, basketball,

If anyone has not seen the schedtrack, etc. Because of the present 
national emergency the civilian en
rollment at Tech is only a small 
fraction of what it is under normal 
conditions, and it is from the small 
civilian group that these teams must 
be picked. Also when it is remem
bered that one of the principles of 
the school is that of not subsidizing 
athletes, it is to Techs credit that 
it has been able to produce a team 
capable of meeting the best in the 
country.
Physically the team is handicaped 
by its lack of height. The Westmin
ster team, while probably not a bet
ter team, averaged about six inches 
taller than the Tech five to the man 
and managed to keep almost con
stant control of the ball. Another 
handicap is the lack of home games 
scheduled this season. The second 
of these home games takes place 
this coming Friday, January 14 at 
the gym. It is up to you to get out 
there and give the team the sup
port it needs.
The Tech starting lineup will 
probably consist of Levy and Kelly 
as forwards; Shott, center; and 
Hathaway and Shrum, guards.

E HANDS D FIRST 
DEFEAT TO TAKE | 
LEAD OF LEAGUE / |
Playing their second game in as 
many nights, Company E defeated 
Company Ds basketball team in a 
hotly contested battle, 43-32, Thurs
day night. It was Company Ds first 
defeat in a league game.
Company E took the lead early 
in the game and held it throughout. 
The Ders made a threat in the first 
half of the third quarter that had 
the baskete-E-ers worried. How
ever, the E team promptly solved 
the style and retook the offensive.
The game was strictly a grudge 
game. Company E wanted revenge 
for the blot on its record that the 
last game between these two teams 
had left.
The outcome of this game placed 
E undeniablv in first place and slip
ped Co. D from first to third place 
in Company Basketball league. It ^ 
must, however, be noted that Co. D 
had just returned from a furlough. 
Evidence of this could be seen in 
the teams lack of coordination.
Both captains courteously compli
mented each others teams for the 
respective fine games they each 
had played. But, an air of tense 
rivalry was noted. Any future 
games between Cos. D and E should 
be sizzlers.
Leading scorers were Rees of Co.
E with 16 points, Bianchetta of Co.
E with 14, and Alderdice who had
10 points. Alderdice is currently 
known as the one-arm-wonder be
cause of his beautiful one arm shots 
from the right side-line.

B Company walloped C Company 
in a rough and tumble practice fray 
last Thursday to the tune of 44-20, 
in a game which more resembled 
football than basketball. Featuring 
two outstanding players, the victors 
had little trouble in downing the 
losing five. The unerring eye of 
Ward, who rang up twenty points, 
coupled with the speed and aggres
siveness of his teammate, Heisey, 
spelled the difference. Wards hook 
shots were the highlight of the 
game. Howarth led the scoring for 
the losers with 6 points. The ballhandling of Company C was poor,

In view of the record of the Tech 
basketball team to date:

[Westminster ...................... 61 38
/Geneva ............................... 38 37

. 'It is conceded by those people on 
the inside that Tech will probably 
not clinch the Intercollegiate Bas
ketball Title this season.
The research bureau of the Sports 
Staff, after much exhaustive labor, 
has come to the conclusion that 
through the process of evolution the 
human race is still changing. As 
proof we reprint certain articles 
from the files of 1938. Before pro
ceeding, we would like to remind 
you that the following articles 
(jokes) were considered humorous 
in 1938. Read at your own risk.
Example 1One of the contest
ants at a wrestling match was on 
his back, writhing and groaning in 
the helpless grip of a toe hold. He 
was so completely powerless that 
all he could do was to shriek and 
groan. A young lady in a ringside 
seat was beginning to be affected by 
the agonizing cries which had been 
going on for some minutes. She 
turned pale as a sheet and began to 
grow faint.
The hardened wrestler who was 
winning the match happened to no
tice her as he casually glanced into 
the audience, and, applying the toe 
hold with all his might, he turned 
to his opponent and said: Cutcha 
crying, buddy,theres a dame out 
front who cant take it.
Example 2A young gentleman, 
recently engaged to the girl he 
adored, unfortunately had his nose 
broken' while playing fotball. A 
doctor was hastily summoned, but 
the victim of the accident would not 
accept his services until he had re
ceived an answer to a telegram just 
dispatched. Two hours later the 
reply came. It was from his lady 
love, and the young gentleman 
handed it to the doctor, saying, re
signedly:
Go ahead now.
The reply to his wire was: Have 
nose set Roman: do not like Greek. 
Cuddles.
Example 3A young man, who 
was not horsy in any sense of the 
word, was visiting in Virginia 
where he had never been before. He 
was seated between two women,
one of whom talked of nothing but 
breeding, the other of nothing but 
jumping. At last one of them caught 
herself up and apologized.
You must think us terrible, she 
said. The fact is we simply love 
horses down here.
Yes, said the other woman on 
the other side of him, we have been 
rude to you. Tell us, are you inter
ested in any sport? What do you 
do?
I shoot, said the young man. 
Ah, said she, and what do you 
shoot?
Horses, said the young man. 
Example 4A lad of my ac
quaintance, a Philadelphian ob
served, does not place languages, 
mathematics, and history very high 
in his scale of important things. One 
day I said to him:
I am delighted to hear of your 
success on the baseball team, Joe, 
but you must remember that there 
are other things in life besides base
ball.
Yes, I know, replied the boy 
solemnly, but, hang it all, Im afraid 
Im too light for football or row
ing.

Two Masks Still 
Among Missing
The search for two sabers and a 
pair of fencing masks continues. 
One week before the epidemic clos
ed all gym activities, two unidenti
fied G. I.s borrowed these articles 
from Pfc. Richard J. Allen, Hender
son Hall. At the time, plans were 
going forward for the formation of 
a fencing team which would meet 
other A.S.T. units of the area. For 
the past week notices have been 
placed on the various company bul
letin boards asking either the re
turn or the location of these missing 
items.
Anyone has the right to use these 
articles. However, since no news 
has been heard of any individuals 
using the sabers since their disap
pearance, it seems evident they are 
merely gathering dust instead of 
new scars. If someone reading this 
article knows where they may be 
found, will he please take the trou
ble to inform Mr. Moses, the Ath
letic Director. The men from whom 
the masks were borrowed are still 
charged for them.
(Incidentally, how do some of 
you fencers feel about an A.S.T. 
Fencing Team for Carnegie Tech?)

As Tom Paine said, These are the 
times that try mens souls. So with 
many fond memories we take leave 
of the magical year of 38 hoping 
never to return. Research will now 
begin on the year 37.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 19443The dTaruetJie ip laid
Xmas Supper Dance 
Turnout A Failure
It seemed quite evident from the 
very poor turnout at the Christmas 
Supper Dance on December 22, 1943 
that the Tech Evening School Stu
dent body has very little interest in
C. I. T. social affairs. Student Coun
cil, Phi Nu, Nu Sigma Alpha, and 
Sigma Delta Phi made sincere ef
forts to plan an affair for the stu
dents which would be new, differ
ent and more enjoyable and in 
every way suit the taste of those 
who shunned the so-called jitterbug 
jive jags. Everything was complet
ed efficiently for a successful party 
and yet we can say it was some
what of a failure.
Where were all these people who 
urged the adoption of a new form 
of entertainment? Where were all 
these ebullient people who showed 
such enthusiasm for the supper 
dance? Surely no one can say that 
there was no publicity to keep the 
student body informed as to the 
time, place, etc. Posters giving in
formation about the affair brighten
ed practically every bulletin board 
on the campus.
What then was wrong? Certainly 
the flu epidemic was a factor in the 
small attendance; but, with an en
rollment of over 800, percentages do 
not warrant this source of absentee
ism a very high rank.
The only conclusion to be drawn 
from this reaction from the student 
body is that little or no interest is 
taken in the job that is done f6r 
them by Student Council. That be
ing the case, it might be expected 
hereafter that there will be little or 
no objection voiced as to how Stu
dent Council serves the Evening 
Student Body. Students! Dont let 
this happen to you.
Enrollment Second Lowest
Second semester enrollment of 
Evening School is the lowest since 
the 1905-06 term, the year Evening 
School began. This should not over
shadow our willingness to continue 
seeking an education but should en
courage everyone to work harder 
so that the training attained here 
may help end the war sooner.
The total as of January 7, 1944 is 
490. The 1943 total for the same 
period was 566. The College of En
gineering, having the largest en
rollment, also suffered the greatest 
loss, with 401 last year as compar
ed to 326 this year. The College of 
Fine Arts dropped from 124 last 
year to 119, and Margaret Morrison 
was the only one to show an in
crease from 41 to 45.

me tell you the latestWe have a 
new MRS. in our midst. Peggy 
Wilhelm took the fatal step over the 
holidays when she went down to 
Jacksonville to visit that Marine 
of hers. Hasnt come back yet eith

Best wishes and oodles of luck go 
to Chuck, now an Army Air Corps

Marie Wilk, Program Manager of 
FM Station W T N T, Frequency 
Modulation affiliate of Station 
W W S W in Pittsburgh, has spent 
many years in radio and met the 
usual number of people it is the fate 
of any program manager to meet. 
But as for seeing the public, as the 
phrase goeshow much can you see 
in a microphone? Of course an au
dience participation show might be 
the solution but until one comes 
along, Marie really gets an oppor
tunity to fulfill what is a secret 
longing of all of uswatching the 
crowds that stop in front of a large 
department store window at Christ
mas timeand from the inside.
One of the larger local depart
ment stores featured a puppet show 
for the Christmas season, the trans
cribed music and script that accompamies the gesticulating marion
ettes was played over a P. A. system 
and if one listened carefully one 
could recognize Marie Wilks voice 
in that of Mrs. Claus, the little 
known spouse of the famous 
rotound gentleman in the red flan
nel suit. Well all that is not so re
markable nor excitingbut when 
the manpower shortage caught up 
with the puppeteers (the show was 
worked by hand, of course), Marie 
after a few hours training, never 
having come within a strings length 
of a puppet before in her life, assist
ed in the operation of the puppets. 
On Friday and Saturday nights 
from 6 to 10, and on Sundays from
11 to 4:30, Marie Wilk had the won
derful experience of being able to 
watch the enrapt kissers and the 
flattened noses of hundreds of 
youngsters and adults, too, glued to 
a window watching the work of her 
fingers, listening to her voice . . . 
and they not knowing at all she was 
there watching their reactions. 
 S wonderful, says Marieonly 
sometimes I got so engrossed myself 
in their expressions that Mrs. Claus 
forgot to kiss Junior Claus goodbye 
when he marched off with Uncle 
Sam in the finale. Great thing this 
radio.
Miss Wilk is an evening student 
at Tech. She is in Mrs. Skinners 
Voice and Speech Class.
