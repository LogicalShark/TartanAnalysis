Professor Schoenberger 
Discusses Robert Frost
' Harold W. Schoenberger, pro
fessor of English at the University 
of Pittsburgh, discussed Robert 
Frosts poetry at the second of 
a series of Book Teas held by 
; Student Council of the Y. M. and 
W. H. A., last Thursday after'noon.
Professor Schoenberger based his 
talk on Mr. Frosts latest volume 
of verse, West-rlmning Brook. 
He compared this volume with Mr. 
, Frosts earlier volumes, among 
k' which are North of Boston and 
Mountain Interval, and came to 
the conclusion that this latest vol*" ume was not so good as the for, mer ones. Mr. Frost seems to 
have changed his style of narra
tive and descriptive verse to lyri
cal, and in the transition has lost 
many of the best qualities of the 
earlier poems.
Milton Susman, University of 
Pittsburgh, Col. 29.  announced 
I that the next lecture of the series 
will be held on January. 8, 1929, 
at which time Elmer Kenyon, 
^ president of the Pittsburgh Center of the Drama League of Amer
ica, will discuss the current plays 
on Broadway. All Tech students 
interested in the drama are invited

Flying Club Members Issue 
Stock to Buy Waco Biplane
At the last meeting of the Flying 
Club, in McGill Hall, further plans 
for the proposed purchase of a new 
Waco 10 biplane for use of the club 
members, were discussed.
Thirty shares of stock with a par 
value of $100 have been issued by 
the organization to raise the pur
chase price of the plane. As soon 
as 30 shares of stock have been sold, 
and the stock certificates have been 
turned over to Student Council, the 
plane will be bought.
The Waco 10 biplane to be purchased by the Fiyiig Club is of the three passenger, dual control type, and is approved by the United States Department of Commerce. Flying instruction will be given by a" United States air mail pilot, appointed by Clifford Ball, manager of the Pittsburgh - Cleveland air mail route. Members of the club who hold stock will be instructed in the operation and maintenance of the plane, fl soon as the principles of plane operation are mastered by the members, they will take the United States Department of Commerce examination necessary to obtain a pilot's license.
After ground school work has been _completed by the students, a government examiner will be present to examine the prospective aviators and to issue official flying permits.

Freshmen Women Can Now Hold Converse With Opposite Sex Without Being Penalized
Departing from the custom of previous years in having plcbe regulations extend throughout tJie entire freshman year, the period of freshman regulations for this year will terminate today, announces John Barr, Architecture, 30, chairman of freshman regulations committee._ The curtailed period of regulations this year, in contrast with those ofprevious years is in the nature of an experiment. The decision to make the experiment was decided upon since Student Council deemed it more advisable to make the shorter period of regulations more strenuous, rather than to have the long period develop into a laxity of enforcement. Success to Determine Regulations.The success of this years plan will determine the period of next years _ regulations b y Student Council^ states Barr. "It is the sincere hope of the freshman regulations committee that the Plebes will take this new privilege in the proper spirit and that they' will orient and adapt themselves as a member of the Carnegie Clan, during the Christmas vacation period;
No ceremonies will accompany the termination of regulations this year. In previous years. the Plebes were excused from regulations on Qualifications Day, held in conjunction with Campus Week, but this feature of campus life has been discontinued this semester.Regulations from which Freshman men are to be excused beginning today include the wearing (Continued on Page 4)
Riitman Explains Fuel Oil 
Discovery before Scientists
Dr. Walter F. Rittman, professor and head of the department of commercial engineering, last week told American petroleum industrialists of his discovery that provoked so much interest among scientists at the International Conference on Bitumin-. ous Coal last fortnight.Dr. Rittman read nis paper, explaining how he converted low grade fuel oil into high grade coal, before the American Pet. oleum Institute in Chicago. Naturally, the institute heard him with great interest since he made clear that his process is commercially feasible and that his product, the coal, can be used to make more gasoline. One large middle western refinery is already using his process, he declared, and added that this plant plans to convert its 
crude petroleum entirely into gasoline, with the manutacture of some coal as a by-product.The real significance of Dr. Rittmans discovery lies in the possibility of obtaining much more gasoline than heretofore from a given amount (Continued on Page 4)
Social Work Students
Plan Novel Features
The Guild, active philanthropic 
organization of Margaret Morrison, 
plans a novel Christmas feature 
in their social work. Instead of 
the usual toy donations to un
fortunate children, money will be 
contributed to the social depart
ment of the Allegheny General 
Hospital for use in urgent case 
work. A small boy needing treatment for paralysis of the hand, a 
girl who has dental work to be done, and another patieht who is in need of a plaster cast to insure perfect recovery, are a few of the individuals who .will benefit from this years contribution.In addition to this splendid work the Guild is furnishing a room at the Kingsley Settlement House on Larimer avenue, for  which they have already purchased copies of four famous paintings. The Vocational Teacher Training Department of Margaret Morrison is assisting in this work by furnishing 
the drapes and cushions for the room. The Guild is greatly interested in Kingsley House, which it has helped maintain for some time.
Woman in Audience Answers All Queries; 
Duke Is Only Danny to Man Out Front
History repeated itself rapidly Thursday afternoon in the audiditorium of _ the Little Theater, where a section of the drama department was rehersing a play.The cardinal wore a neat blue suit and tie, and seemed to have a peculiar lack of words in vital moments. Did you order the (execution of the Kings messenger? The - Cardinal didn't know, but a lady out in the audience did. She had all the answers. Then there was the gentleman in a gray suit known as the Duke, whom some called Lord, but to whom the man out front referred as Danny. Danny wasn't quite bright. He amused himself at times by pouring over a volume that wasnt there. Once he offered it to his friend who, fortunately, was polite 
enough to make believe that he was glad to get it.Suddenly there was an outburst from the boys standing by
the picture frame and a cry went up, The King, the King. We all looked, and sure enough there was the King, with his arm propped up on a pole, wearing a striped blue sport sweater and a pair of bell, bottomed trousers. The King was a nice boy, but he seemed a bit high hat, as if everyone were pestering him.
The master of ceremonies sat out in the audience. We dont know what the name of the play Uv*s, but it seemed to be As He Liked It. We all erot to, like the Cardinal, although he seemed kind of short-winded, as if he had been smoking too many cigarettes, and we were surprised when this master of ceremonies said: Thatsfine, after the Duke had insulted him. It seemed then that he had a grouch against the Cardinal and when he cried out, I guess well kill the Cardinal now, we left, for we hate to see a row.
President Baker Claims European Systems 
Are Superior to Local Educational Methods
The European system of edu
cation is more successful than the 
American system because it is less 
specialized and more theoretical,  said Dr. Thomas S. Baker, president of Carnegie Institute, in an interview today.
The American system of education meets the present demands of the people, but there is a great dan-f
er that college  life in the United tatcs will become too highly specialized and will not give the student the necessary br.oad culture. The best type of education is the one which makes it possible for a* student to adapt liis training to the varying changes that take place in life, One cannot, train for a particular vocation for the requirements in pro
fessional and business fields are constantly changing."The European sj'stem \of education emphasizes the theoretical side, for the continental student has a wide interest in culturc, continues Dr. Baker. The American student usually trains for a particular vocation to the exclusion of other fields 'of study. But there is a growing tendency in America to select college students with greater care, for 
the numbers entering college is growing and the University can not afford to educate them at the present tuition rates. If college enrollment continues to increase there will be a surplus of college men for whom there is no satisfactory outlet in the business and professional worlds.

Memorial services for the late 
Captain Roald Amundsen, explorer 
and discoverer of the South Pole 
and Northwest passage, will be 
held Friday, 8:15 oclock, at the 
Little Theater at Carnegie Toch, under the auspices of the Norwegian Society of Pittsburgh, aided by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Institute of Technology.
The date of the services is significant in that December 14, 1911, was the day on which Captain Amundsen, accompanied by a small group of fellow-explorers, planted the Hag of Norway at the South Pole and claimed the discover} for his country. Memorial services are to be held in every principal city on Friday, commemorat
ing the achievements of the noted explorer. The local services are public.
Captain Amundsen lost his life when he flew to the rescue of General NobMe and the ill-fated members of liis Arctic flight, after their dirigible, the Italia, was, wr.jrkcd :n an aUe-iiipl to fly 'ovcr the - North Pole. Captain Amundsen and his crew of six were given up for dead when a pontoon was found in the ocean off Norway and definitely identified as -that oi the seaplane, Latham, in which 
they made their last flight.There is, perhaps, no man with a more remarkable record in polar research and in general explora(Continued on Page .4)
Carnegies Sick to Get 
Y Xmas Radio Service
Carnegie Y. M. C. A. radio serv
ice to sick students will function 
during the holidays as usual accord
ing to R. V. Davis, Y secretary. 
All of the six sets will be in use.
Radio service was started about 
four years ago, with one set and 
has proved so popular that the Y. 
M. C. A. has now six sets, four of 
which are in constant use. A radio 
is installed for any student, whether 
or not he is a member of the Y, 
who is confined by illness for any 
length of time. At the past national 
election all of the sets were lent 
out to the student associations that they might get returns. Y. M. C. A. offered their radio to A1 Lassman, captain of N. Y. U. team, but he had already been taken care of.Davis states that the radios have brought a great many students in touch with the Y. M. C. A., who would never have been reached otherwise. One man was so grateful that he is making the Y a gift of another set.
T.ch RaJo Hour Includes 
Campus Activities Program
One Carnegie Tech Radio Hour, and possibly two, will be broadcast over station KDKA sometime during the present college year, according to  C. Jewett, chairman of the radio committee. On February 14 of last year, a similar hour was presented through the same station, and the program met with unusual success. It was intended earlier to present the first of the radio hours planned for this year sometime in December, but owing to the fact that activities have been so numerous of late, and that considerabcl conflict arose in1 the arrangement of a suitable dat, it was necessary to postpone the hour.Chairman Jewett says the first radio hour will almost certainly take place in January, with prospects that it will occur on Thursday evening, either the 17 or 24, between 10:30 and 11:30 p. m. Although this hour may seem rather late in this section of the country, it may be recalled that fartlierywcst it is comparatively early in the evening. A program very much similar to the one presented last year has been suggested, and will be submitted for approval to the members of the radio committee. Except for certain modifications and revisions which the committee will probably advise, a program much like the following, which has merely been recommended, will be broadcast: a song by the glee(Continued on Page 3)

spoke on his experiences with the 
bureau at the semi-annual banquet of the Carnegie Tech Miners and Metallurgists Society last week in the Carnegie Inn. Other speakers at the inner were Mr. Young, vice president of the Pittsburgh Coal Company; Dr. L. Blough, physical director of. Aluminum 
Limited of Pittsburgh, and Dean Mott of the College of Engineering. ^
The program was arranged by Professor Aston of the metallurgy 
department, and J. A. Scott, Eng. .29, metallurgy. The dinner set a record in number present and 
in spirit for the event of next spring to aim at, for a large group of night students swelled the attendance. Mr. Perrotts speech concerned important happenings while he has been with the Bureau of Mines and a discussion on what a metallurgy student may expect in life after college.
Administrative Board States 
Discipline Procedure Change
Reinstatement of a DisciplinedStudent Requires Directors Approval of His Petition
At a recent meeting of the executive board of administration, a restatement of the discipline procedure to be followed in the event of an offense committed by. a student was formally adopted and put into effect December 5. _ Except for certain changes, the revised disciplinary routine is fundamentally the same as the procedure followed in the past. Before this time it was customary for the student to present an appeal to the discipline committee, whereas the revised procedure specifics that an appeal must be made? to ythe president. Another worthy innovation is the representation of the .student body by a member of Student Council, who will actually sit among the jurors to determine the fate of the student on trial. The student representative was formerly concerned only_ with legislative matters.Disciplinary Routine Is SameWith these two alterations the disciplinary routine is much the same, and has been itemized into distinct steps as follows:1. All cases, irrespective of the nature or place of offense, shall be reported immediately and directly to the Dean of Men who shall refer each case to the Director of the College concerned.2. In a personal interview,, the Director shall inform the student of the charge against him.3. If the student admits the charge, the penalty. shall be determined by the Director of the College, and the Doan of Men^ and

Small Assembly Receives 
New Carnegie Song Number
A new Carnegie musical number, "The Plaid Song," was given a good reception by a small gro.up of students attending the third general assembly of the year in Carnegie Music Hall last Tuesday. Miss Helen Hotliam, of the drama department, presented a group of readings before 
the assembly.The composer oi the new song, Walter Sickles, M30, introduced his creation by singing and playing the accompaniment with the audience joining in the choruses. Sicklcs has already arranged the song for the use of the Kiltie Band this year. If the number continues to be popular among the student body, indications arc that it will be included in the next issue of the Carnegie Song 
Book.In remarking about the poor attendance at the assemblies, several student activities leaders, including Irene Tedrow, D29, co-chairman of the assembly committee of Student Council, attributed the reason chiefly to the lack of advertising preparatory to the meetings. Miss Tedrow believed that the assembly last week was especially affected by this situation.Ralph Hitchcock, P. and D.29, how

Mens and Women's Senior Balls Combine Because of Deficits Incurred in Former Years
Requesting the continuation of Carnegies annual Campus Week next spring, _ more than SOO upperclassmen petitioned Student Council at a meeting of the organization last Tuesday evening.
Following a short discussion, President J. C. Stauffer, Arch. 30, referred the petition to William Carson, Phys. 29, chairman of the Special Committee, with the recommendation of the council that Carson-confer on the matter with Dr. Thomas S. Baker and the deans as soon as possible. _ Stauffer intimated that Council will take definite action on the future status of Campus Week immediately after the Christmas vacation.
Several arguments in support of the spring celebration were set forth in the petition, which was drawn up by A. M. Fisher, Com. E. 29. It was stressed that Campus Week is distinctly a school affair, planned, conducted and participated in by all students. "Campus Week has become a Carnegie Tech tradition and as such is of value to the spirit and the development of the school. Because of the elimination of the Easter vacation, it is ]desirable for the administration to grant a rccess later in the spring.
The petition answered the claim that Campus Week is more of a detriment than an aid to study, by attributing the majority of class room failures to listlessucss brought on by "Spring fever, rather than because oi too many activities. Campus Week is Tradition Campus^ Week, an annual celebration at Carnegie for a number of years, is looked upon almost as a school institution. However, in drawing up the calendar for the present achool year, the administration deemed it advisable to abolish the week on the grounds that it was detrimental to the best interests of the student. The action resulted in unfavorable studdnt comment culminating in the petition submitted to Council by the Student Body,
At Tuesdays meeting the names of J. G. Bair, Met E. '31, and G. L. Dunn, Arch .30, candidates for the editorship of the 1929 Thistle, were referred back to the Thistle publication board. Student Council refused to assume responsibility for the direct election of the editor. The Thistle board was instructed to make a choicc between the two men, Council concurring in the selection.Thistle Request Kuiuued A request of the Thistle board for permission to increase the size of the year book from 8^x11 inches to 10x12 inches was refused. Council declared that the reasons upon which request was made did not warrant I a change, and that by increasing the size of the book it would be cumbersome and disrupt the orderly collection of standard-sizea books.Budgets for both the Mens and Womens Glee Clubs as submitted by . J. T. Seibert, W. M. 9, chairman of the Budget Committee, were unanimously approved by Council. The 
Mens Glee Club was given $550 for the current year, an increase of $50 over the initial budget of last year. The Womens Glee Club was apportioned $275. This is an increase of. $25 over last years budget, but $25 less than the amount asked for this season.

With Christmas taking leaps and

The campaign for Dollar Day to 
dat? has not beep much of a suc
cess. ,Up until December 7, only 
$550 had been contributed. As this sum is even less than last years, the results so far are quite disappointing. Last year over $600 was raised and given to the endowment fund."As was done last year, the time for collection of dollars has been extended to January 1. In this time it is hoped that the amount collected to date will be doubled. That is the desire of the Alumni office. At the beginning of the campaign it was thought that there would be no trouble in raising 
several hundred dollars more than the amount raised last year.To make this year's drive a success every alumni must contribute his or her dollar to this fund. Surely you can give one dollar to this worthy cause. Make it a 
Christmas present to your Alma Mater. It will surely be appreciated.
Students also 'should contribute to the cause. A few have given dollars without being asked. One .student gave two dollars, one for this year and one for last. If eyory one, students and alumni alike had this spirit the Dollar Day fund would have long ago reached the quota set by the Alumni office.Send a check for one dollar made payable to the Alumni Fed
eration, or a $j together with your name.

Night Student Council i Idle Thoughts of an Idle Night Student
Monthly Meeting Of
Night Student Council
The Night Student Council held its monthly meeting on December 2, and some of the questions discussed and action taken were as follows:The books of the previous year have been audited and found correct showing the following balances: Night College of Fine Arts, $28.59; Night College of Industries $10.57; Night College of. Engineering, $72.97; Night Student Council, $326.51. The last mentioned amount includes the $100.00 Loyalty Bond, and $63.00 undivided Activities Fees collected. Pursuant with Council action last year the balances held by the three colleges together with the undivided Activities Fee arc to be turned over to the Activities Building Fund.The Night College of Fine Arts, and the Night College of Engineering presented budgets for a dance and banquet ^respectively. The dance to be held in the Union, and the banquet to be held at the Roosevelt hotel. These budgets were approved.The appointments of the Plaid .Staff were also formally approved.The question of the Arts Ball was again discussed. The Council not being advised of the personnel of any committees of the night students, it was, upon motion decided to drop any further action this year. The majority of the Night Arts officers arc of the opinion they should have been acquainted with any committee 
a'ppointmcnt's if. they arc to' be included in this activity.Non-delivery of the Tartan was again discussed. Every regularly registered night ' student is entitled to. . rcccivc the paper through the . mail. It appears there arc quite a few students not getting the paper. An effort will be mulc to correct this.
CHRISTMAS RECESS
KILTIE BAND
Night students in all colleges take ' notice that there will be no classes from Saturday, December 16, 1928, .until Wednesday. January 2, 1929, the occasion of the Christmas recess.The Plaid takes this occasion to wish all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy, Bright and Prosperous . New Year.
Our recent article regarding financial assistance for the band by the night students elicited the following letter from no less a personage than the Graduate Manager, Clarence "BuddyS Overend.Dear Mr. McDonald: As I satat home tonight reading The Garncgie Tartan, turning to page three and in the last column I notice an article by one of the night students headlined Financial Assistance for Band Night Students. I cannot miss the opportunity of following this idea with my hearty approval of this plan, and if such a fund is started, count me in for ten^ dollars.The Kiltie Band is one of the finest organizations that we have at school and deserves the support of every student whether lie attends school at night or day."In order to equip our band with twenty-five extra uniforms, making a total band of 85 picces, I understand this would cost about two thousand five hundred dollars. Then take into consideration the night school registration, this would mean lcs^ than a. dollar per man.I feel sure if the night school Council will start a movement ofi this kind that a great many of fhc I Alumni will also make contributions. I would like to see this come entirely from the night school students and alumni of the night school.Put it over Mac;1 you and the other live wires can do it. Start the ball rolling now so that by next fall Carnegie Tech can pride themselves 'of the finest band in the country. Best of success, with kindest regards, I remain, Sincerely yours, Clarence Overcnd, "Graduate Manager.'There' is no more colorful organization on any campus than our own Kiltie Band, and I' am confident that there isn't one night student who wouldn't be glad to help along the movement to curc additional uniforms for this all  Carnegie organization.Your editor would be glad to rcccivc donations and suggestions and will gladly aid any plan which will be submitted.May .we count on your help to pul; this project over?

It is with deep dissatisfaction that 1 am writing about the Twenty-seventh International Art Exhibit. Not that this articlc means anything in the art world, but, my mind, it isn't the best exhibit 
Ive seen.
First prize, Still Life, by Andre Dorain, a Frenchman, is certainly not the best painting of this artist if we can class him as one by seeing his Still Life at the Exhibit. . It is not beautiful, it not colorful, it has not the best technique. Then what was it the judges saw in it that was striking? They say it has a noble conception. To me it is different it is repulsive. When I stepped before the canvas, one look was 
enough.
Second prize, also a still life, was won by a Spaniard, Pedro 'Pruna. America certainly brings fame to all sorts of people. This is the first time lie was ever heard of, and it is not any wonder, with such a painting. If flowers look as Pedro paints them, nature has been fooling us all along.Third prize, won by Glenn O. Coleman, an American. The judges say lie paints as he sees things. Then, by George, lie should have his eyes examined 1 Anyone with good eyesight and who has studied art would paint the perspective 
of things correctly.I think the only sane and really good picture in a modern way is the painting, Dod Proctors Portrait of a Girl, and, incidentally, it won first honorable mention. I dont see why it did not get first prize. The Portrait is of pleasing character. There is beautiful color 
and grace of handling. One can almost see the blood in its circulation beneath the girls skin. Mrs. Proctor has succeeded in doing what so many artists attempt and 
fail.The painting, Whimsical Walker, by Laura Knight, an Eng
lishwoman, is a wonderful portrait. One can see the humanness in the handling, and understanding of life. The clown's face has a beautiful smile, and beneath the smile one can discern - his heart is troubled with the cares of the world.The Detour,' by Marquis E. Rcitzel, is a nice picture for a magazine, but not for a Fine Arts Gallery, because it is too illustrative.Racc Track Deauville, by Guy Pcncdc Bois. J would like to read the book that  inspired the picture. It must have been a corking good story.Still Life, by Pablo Ruis Picasso, in color is absolutely dead. Some artists depend on the color combination to put their pictures across. Pablo has neither color nor a uniform design. It is simply disgusting.If this modern trend keeps up, art schools will not be necessary. One docs not need an art education to be .able to make such things as a Picasso painting.C. R. C.
Suggestion For Night
Engineering Banquet
This is a yearly affair held by the 
students of theCollege of Engineering and.a very extensively advertised event, insofar as the good time we usually have there is concerned. . In the following article I wish to discuss a few things, but before hand, let me say that I do not wish it as destructive criticism to any person or event. I, at present, have tickets 
for sale for this function, and intend going myself, butthere are a few. things that I think I should have a wider circulation and, since we have a paper for this purpose,. I am resorting to this means.First of all, why is this banquet held ? I would suppose that it j_s a get-together meeting of the Night Engineers, in school, although I have seen quite a number of men who are not in school at the affair, and also 
quite a few outsiders entirely.'Then comes the questionhow is it held, To my knowledge a banquet hall is secured and a price for the dinner set. To this price an additional small amount is added to help pay for the entertainment and the bulk of the entertainment cost comes out of the students activity fee of the College of Engineering.The stucfent activity fee is the dollar paid by the student upon registration and, after the Council budget is taken out this fee is prorated between the three colleges to defray the expenses of smokers and other functions held bythe individual college. The thought that strikes me 
is this: Is the banquet the rightplacc to-put our activity fee? Surely, we get the benefit of it provided we go, but how about the man who must look .twice at the banquet price before he spends it, and then decides that he cannot afford to go. He has paid his activity fee and is entitled to all the benefits therefrom, but if we arc going to hand it' to him with a string tied to it, such as saying that, it is here at the banquet for you ;.~d making him come across again does not seem fair to me. Then again, if a man cannot afford to go'he is losing the benefit
In spite of all the signs and announcements to do our Christmas -shopping early, wonder wliy it is that we all wait until the last minute until we finally get into the mad scramble. Each year I make a firm resolution that never again will I let the present buying go until this late date and by the time that Christmas gets here again it is the same old story. Incidentally, it does not seem to me that people exchange gifts as they once did. Now it: is more in' the form of greeting cards, and personally I think it is a fine thing. If the present trend continues the old jokes about f the Christmas necktics and socks 'and so on will be all out of date and wont even be funny.Well, the Arts had their big blowout last Saturday and from an eye witness it was quite some affair. This is not surprising if one knows Jimmy Sansonitti, as lie certainly is a live.wire and you can bet your last years straw hat that any dance lie sanctions will be OK.'The latest advices emanating from the Engineers state that everything is in readiness for their big banquet this coming Saturday at the Roosevelt. They lajm this one is to surpass all previous ones. Well, it certainly is going to be some job to accomplish and I know' whereof I speak because I have attended several of the past affairs and there was plenty of action in those, so it is hard to imagine what will happen at this one.Wonder how the Thistle Committee is making out. So far have heard nothing in connection with this publication and to an outsider it appears as though they better get started if they intend, to finish up before school closes as there is much work to be done.Wasnt that a peach of a suggestion from the night Industries man in connection with the Kilty Band.
ii---------------------------------------------------*
Now that the thing has been started we should all kick in with a buck a piece and put the thing over in a way to make Carnegie proudof her night students. There are 3,500 of us this year, so if we would all do this, you can readily see that we could furnish about 35 uniforms and then if the day students would furnish their usual number, we would easily have the largest collcge band in the country. Lets send in our dollar right now before we forget and also cause we usually feel niore gener-1 ous this time of the year.Well, we arc almost at the half way mark and it wont be long now until the classes can be consolidated. It seems a shame that so many should drop out each year. Of course, some . are dropped because they do not pass the exams. Some of these men would like to continue the balance of the year even though they know they are not eligible to take the exam at the end of'the year. As I understand, this is not permitted by the school. Now, here is where I think there is something wrong. Even though the tuition is notvery high, it seems to me that the men _ who flunk out and are . not permitted to attend classes for the second semester should be given a refund. If this is not pofesible', then these men should be grouped together / in a class and given thework of the previous semester over again. This eliminates the loss of half a year and Kiv.es the student full value for his money.Dont forget the Post-Holiday Dance on January 12 in the Union. This is another popular affair, on the Night Campus.So far 192S has been a pretty ood year and in some, ways wearc sorry to see it depart, in fact, very sorry, were it not for the hopes of 1929, so the Idle Student wishes you all A Very Merry Christmas and A Happy and Prosperous New Year.

'to him that hath shall be given 
proposition. Why should any man 
help pay for someone clscs enter

ford to pay the additional pricc?
Here is a suggestion to our of
ficers in Engineering: Why not have 
two separate prices i for these banquet tickets? One for the outsider and man not in school, and a rebated ticket for the night engineer in school. I recently talked with a graduate student who is still veryactive in our midst and otic who attends all our functions. This man feels that he would rather pay a higher price for his ticket and have the price knockcd off the students ticket for he feels that tne student has paid once. Suppose we could arrange to have these men pay,, say 50 cents more,, and the same 50 cents taken from .the student ticket, it would be an incentive to the students to go and also place the pricc more within the reach of many of us.Let us have the. banquet, surely, but let us be fair to all.H.

Quite a numbeV of night students arc complaining that they arc not receiving their copy of the Tartan. It is the desire of the Night Student Council that every 
student \vho pays the $1 Activity Fee receives the Tartuii weekly. ,lf there are any members of this class who are not getting the Tartan, they arc requested to hand ir. their names and address to the instructor, or send the information to the Night Student Council, Box 137, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pa.
The Plaid sheet of the Tartan is being edited for your particular benefit,' and comments are solicited as to how we are succeeding. Contributions are also desired from various classes and anybody with ability to write is solicited to submit articles. Send this data to the Plaid Editor, Room 12 Industries Building, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pa.
The Puppet, staff is desirous of securing' the co-operation, and patronage of the night students, both as to aid in distribution of the publication and also the sale and 
purchase of the various , issues. They have offered to create a night staff, and an effort is being made to secure one. Any student is eligible to participate in this activity, and suitable awards will lie made where the work justifies." The plan is to sell the Puppet during the week (of -issue before classes. This would only require a half hour or so between 7 and 7:30 p. m. If there is any one interested in the staff end, please send in the name to the Night Puppet Stag, Room i2, Industries Building, Carnegie Institute of Tcchiiology, Pittsburgh, Pa. When you| are solicited for purchase of the Puppet, wc hope yp\\ will patronize this student publication.

Deserved Recognition Figures Campus Week Placing This Column Teletypesetter
Wc arc all without doubt very glad to see the d(served recognition which is, being given to Howard Harpstcr. He is worthy of all the nice things that can be said about him. Of course, it is too bad that Pitt with the able assistance of certain sports writers were, unable to manufacture an All-American For than in former years.
Wc wonder what the official registration figures arc this year. Todate wc have not seen them announced. The general impression is, at least in Industries, that the number of student is considerably larger .than in, formrc years.
This column, for some reason, orother feels the urge to' mention thatmuch ^ discussed subject, "Campus Week. The administrations stand may be.justified, of course, but the consensus of student opinion seems to be vastly in favor of holding, in all its glory, the traditional event. We certainly would like to sec the matter cleared up to the satisfaction of the majority of those concerned.Incidentally we hope this column doesnt get misplaced. On The Side" would, of course, prefer the left side 
of the page, because as wc arc taught in printing, it getsuncoil*, sciously, of course, first attention from the reader. Wc hope you don't think it should be "outside."Interesting news from the Printing Department. The recent, reported invention of the tclc-typcsettcr, a machine that will set type by telegraph or radio. This new devise combines the Linotype machine and the tclcgraph-typcwritcr. The claims of the inventor arc that with this devise, when perfected, one man will be enabled to set type for scores of newspapers,. in many different cities at the same time. This Invention, if it proves to -be practical,'will certainly be a great time and labor saver for the newspaper industry.L.

of crude oil. In fact, that is what he set out to accomplish. Ji is a vital link in a chain that leads to increased production,The "cracking" of petroleum as generally practiced gives about a 50 per cent yield of gasoline. Professor Rittman claims that he cari increase this figure by 90 per cent or obtain a 95 per cent yield by applying his process to distillation. To do this, lie uses only the fuel oil residue. He demonstrates the practical value of it in his. paper:"Low grade fuel oil at the present time in the Middle West is selling at about one and one-half ccnts a gallon. When, with a manufacturing cost of a few ccnts a gallon, it is possible lo convert considerable portions of the fuel oil into gasoline, then it al once becomes obvious that the goal of the progressive refiner is to produce a maximum or gasoline and a minimum of fuel oil from a given quantity of crude oil, particularly since he receives for a gallon of fuel oil only a fraction oi the price which he pays for crude petroleum.'The National Petroleum News for November 28, and the Oil and Gas Journal for November 29, published the entire paper.Because of his wide interest, Dr. 
Rittman has been well known for 
some time in scientific circles, bul the first reading of his paper, which 
was also the first intimation of his discovery, brought him national prominence. Other scientists had just reported success in making oil from coal when he told them how to reverse the process. The Associated Press wired that he "startled the conference.Professor Rittman reaches three classes at Tech: Industrial Management, Buying and Selling and , Commercial Engineering Reports. He is also consulting engineer for the United States Department of Agriculture, national president of the Society of Industrial Engineers, and author of numerous articles on fuel, oil and gas. He is retained by several refining companies, and at the Petroleum Institute lie represented mid-continent refiners, lie celebrated his forty-fifth birthday on Decem

Evanston, 111.Dec. 31, 1927Larus & Bro.

Now, mark you, these fellows have no communication with each other. They live in widely separated parts of the country, so it was no put-up joke on me or anything like that. But here came seventeen boxes of tobacco, and sixteen of them the familiar blue Edgeworth! The seventeenth was a very flossy walnut, brass-trimmed, box, but if I know tobacco, the contents were Edgeworth with a little perique in it.  Just coincidence, perhaps, but a queer one. Am not an habitual smoker of Edgeworth, so they werent catering to any especial taste of mine. Looks like a consensus of opinion among the highbrowsor quite a batch of emthat Edgeworth is the stuff, the proper caper for a gift.

Greater Freedom of Speech and Decreasing 
Introspection Characterize Modern Student
Hello Skibosl This welcome conics from the most widely known and most feared person on I he University of Pittsburgh campus; no other than the Campus Scout, who sees all, knows all, and tells all in a confidental way to the student body of the across the way school. You arc now about to be entertained by the master dopcstcr and scoopcr of local collegiate circles.
Wc have just been waiting for this chance to explode with the pent up praise for the Car
negie Tech football team which wc have had in store for the past few weeks. Your scout was fortunate enough to see two Tartan grid games this past season, and wants to let you Scotchmen know right now that wc think you have one of the best teams in the country. That Harpster boy is one of the best players this writer has ever seen in action, and had your scout not seen Ken Strong in action, would rate 
I-Iarpstcr the greatest back to visit this district in the memory of your scout. But say, didnt Strong play a superb game against the Tartans over in Barney Drcyfuss back yard? Harpster is through next year, 
graduating next spring, probably with honors. He is a wonderful loolball player and a good basket ball player. Me combines brains with his build and skill, an. ideal 
combination as any coach will readily admit. But after all, I-Iowdie may have been more than onecleventh of Coach Steffens team, but it took 10 other men to mow down all opposition with the exception of N. Y. U. Having seen 
Carnegie in only two games, your scout can not recall every man on the eleven, but a few did stand out in the Pitt and N. Y. U. games. Miciziner is about as good a center as we have ever seen, with the exception of Chuck Howe, 
Princeton s captain and alNAmcrican. Your scout scrimagcd against Howe when lie was a mere high school lad. Sol Miciziner is big, fast and keen at diagnosing plays! of the opposition. Your smut' knew John.. Karcis when lie was the idol of the high school girls 
down at Monaca High. He and Roscnzweig did plenty to slave off defeat until the final game,It semes rather strange that Carnegie Tech, champions of the district, should have only one man chosen to play on Coach Andy Kerrs all-Eastcrn team at California, December 29. Captain Harpster is the sole Tartan griddcr to receive the honor and the trip. Two Pitt men have been invited and will acccpt the offer to 
play on the sunny Californian coast. Captain Fox. guard, and Mike Gctto, tackle, will accompany the Wash-Jeff mentor 
to the coast. Pitts powerful forward wall was one of the strongest in the country and caused comment from coast to coast. No wonder two of the
iug, adds Dr. Schoen. "It .is usually a veil for ones real feeling. A person docs not deliberately prevaricate, but it is difficult to probe to one's depth and to honestly tell what is there. Wc dctcivc ourselves-when wc think wc arc being honest.
"When students answer questionnaires, they answer honestly. But when the questions deal with personal matters, the answers bccomc untrustworthy. There is a reluctancc among students to answer honestly when they know that strangers, will read them. Questionnaires arc valuable only so far as they indicate general tendency in a certain direction, as the drawing away from accepted creeds, but they arc useless in. drawing definite conclusions, con-- cludcs Dr. Schoen.
Panther linemen were choscn. Other Eastern stars who will make the trip includc Ken Strong of N. Y. U., Chuck Howe of Princeton, and perhaps Cagle of Army.Last year Captain Gibby Welch of the Panthers was offered a bid 
to make the trip to California for the annual East-West all-star game, but the Pitt authorities refused him permission to go.Well, you students have surely had enough football and red headlines for one season, so let us turn to the more gentle sport of the hardwoods. With a sour taste in your mouths from last years cage season it will be hard for you Tech students to look upon the impending basketball campaign With any great enthusiasm. But after all, Captain White and his boys set a record. It is doubtful if any other college basketball team in this part of the country ever went through a season without a single victory. And when you play the champions of the country three times a season you can mark down three defeats with as"Studcnts talk more today because it is a growing indication of emancipation, but this talk hardly ever rc; suits in action, states Dr. Max Schoen, professor and head of the j department of education and psy! chology, in a rcccnt interview.
"There is greater freedom in talking about self-analysis than ever before, but students are no more introspective than /before. This tendency towards openness and frankness is wholesome, for one often gets a new light on the subject. We should guard ourselves against drawing general conclusions from particular instances, from believing that talk 
means action, and from accepting at facc value what any person says.Language very often is riot necessarily an indication of actual feelProminent Women Elected

At the start of the year Coaches Stefr fen and Waddell were handicapped by the loss of many veterans, To fill their positions they had only green men from last years plebe squad, but the willingness which these men showed to overcome their lack of experience, partly made up for this handicap.Captain Harpster, who was picked on practically every all-American team selected this, year, played a vital role in the" teams success. His wonderful example and excellent leadership made everyone boost the Skibos' from the - start of "the season. The progress of the' team can be noted by''a.glance, at the seasons scores. After much ragged playing in the early - games, the team seemed .to gain momentum for the major games. The players were at their peak against Georgetown and Notre Dame. Their performances in these/.two games ranked them among the leading teams of the county. After this_ terrible grind, a let-up was unavoidable and the relaxation in the N. Y. U. game brought no discredit to the squad.Tartans Set Fast Pace The season opened at Youngstown and after a sloppy game the Tartans emerged on the long end of a 32 to 6 score. Carnegie showed great power at times but Were only a mere shadow of their real strength. Karcis proved to the followers that he was a great line plunger and a stone wall on the defense. Moorehead showed great improvement, over his showing of the previous year, giving promise of developing into a great ball-carrjer.
The second game was against Ashland. Displaying a fine brand of football the Tartans rang up a 65 to 0 triumph. Karcis continued his steam-i'oller attack through the 
holes his teammates opened in the Ashland line. Red Kennedy provided the thrills of tins game with a brilliant run of 65 yards. Harpster played his usual game, which means his generalship and passing were above the average. Although Ashland had defeated two prominent Ohio teams they were outclassed and proved little opposition to the powerful Carnegie offense. First Important Game Is W.-J. The first major game of the year was against Wash-Jcff, and \vas won 19 to 0. In this game Carnegie dismissed the jinx which had been hanging over their athletic relations for the last eight years. Again Harpster stood out like a beacon light in a lonely mountain section. This does not mean that the rest of the starting lineup which included Sweet, Schmidt, Loyewell, Melziener, Dresliar, Highberger, Rosetmveig, Letzeltcr,. Eyth, and Karcis did. not play WeiP'f6r~'ficy riot' pihTy'smothered evpry play the visitors started but succeeded in battling down the opposition until they could no longer resist the powerful Tech offense. In this gantc the line showed its best football to this date, for only the powqr. plats were used so the more deceptive plays would surprise Pitt, Georgetown and the rest.
Almost a Downfall Our fifth game of the past season was against Pitt whom we defeated 6-0. This game was bitterly contested from start to finish but a little relaxation seemed to have taken place in the team, A muddy field handicapped both teams, but especially Tech, due to their particular style of play. Pitt played a seven man line against Tech, while Carnegie resorted to its Usual six man defense. Pitts seven man line, while especially strong in power plays, is weak against forward passes. Harpster put the game in the fcag for Tech late in the fourth quarter by tossing two beautiful passes to Shaughnessy. Pitt showed a powerful offense in mid-field, but when the ball was in Carnegie's own territory, its defense stiffened and the Panthers were unable to score.J he sixth game, in which our opponents were from Georgetown, was played in Albany. Again Carnegie was victorious and the followers of":the .team came back rejoicing over a 13-0 score. The entire Tech team seemed to click tor the first time and although Georgetown * was the strongest team we had met they were outplayed .in every department of the game. Rosenzweig finally mastered the art of running the end around play, and considerable, yardage and one touchdown resulted from this, 
r in5'S tallys barreled bodied fullback, was practically unstoppable on tjie offense and in backing up the line he and Dreshar stand out as two of the best in college ranks.
Notre Dame Falls Behind
The seventh, and perhaps the greatest game from any standpoint, was the game against Notre Dame at South Bend, against whom the 
team continued its winning stride. Before the game was five minutes old Tech had illustrated they were at their peak by scoring two touchdowns. In the third play of thegame Rosenzwieg caught a short pass from Harpster and ran sixty yeards before he was stopped. On the next play Letzelter tore through the line for twenty yards and Carnegies first score. Four minutes ater -Harpster added another on a line play. Rosenzweig ran the end around play on the next touchdown and Letzelter added thefourth and last after catching ashort pass from Harpster. Thescore^ 27-7 does not illustrate the last Thursday afternoon in the auNotre Dame scored their' touchdown on a Tech fumble shortly after the second half started. The game, if it did nothing else, helped to prove that the 1926 game was no fluke and it can not be said they lost because Rockne was not
With no raise in the usual $15 for activities and athletic contests, and $5 for breakage, Carnegie Tech 
students,will be able to attend ten varsity, and several freshmen football games in the Pitt Stadium next season, announces Clarence Overcnd, graduate manager of athletics.
Although he has not made any 
arrangement yet with regard to the financial income of the stadium, Jie has definitely closed an agreement with W. Don Harrison, athletic director at Pitt, that students from both institutions will be able to attend each others home games during their joint* co-operative use of the stadium
The agreement made between 
the athletic departments of both schools is planned for a period of 15 years.The football schedule for next 
Beason is not completed, but probably will be within the next two weeks. There are, however, five games already scheduled for the stadium: Thiel, October 5; WashJcff, October 19; Notre Dame, October 26; Pitt, Novgmbcr 16, and 
New York University, November 
28.Overend Gives Comment 
In commenting on this arrangement, Graduate Manager Overend says: In the future it will not be difficult to get together and arrange our schedules to suit the general public of Pittsburgh. By 
this joint use of the Pitt Stadium between Carnegie and Pitt, the general public will come to the games every Saturday, and no con
flicts in local'football interests will take place.The boys on the football teams will have more games away from l-ome than in previous seasons, more traveling and will be rer lieved from continual home playr 
ing."Students will have the advaiir tage of the combination student 
book, which both .schools will honor at the stadium.Combined application blanks have been sent to the general alumni of Carnegie and Pitt, and these applications are being filled out and returned daily. Also, the parents of the students are. getting in on this plan.A tentative schedule of the games to be played at the stadium 
next season follows:Sept. 28__Pitt vs. WaynesburgOct. 5______Carnegie vs. ThielOct. 12__Pitt vs. West Virginia Oct. 19-Carnegie vs. Wash-Jeff Oct. 26_Carnegie vs. frjotre DameNov. 2___.-Pitt vs. Ohio State

Prepare For Tough Card
Tfhree-Oame Series With Panthers Is Leading Attraction On 16-Game Schedule.
With a schedule of 16 games and a crew of 14 men before liitfl. Coach John Irwin, Carnegie cage 
mentor, is now going through the ordeal of trying to forip a quin
tet which will grind out a successful season.Tartan basketcers have been warming up to the hoop for the past two weeks and three weeks of practice remain before them prior to their initial encounter of the 1929 season, January 4, when 
they meet the Waynesburg five on a foreign floor. Fourteen men are out for honors, six of whom were members of last years squad.Captain White Returns The return of Harvey White in the capacity of captain, greatlyenhances the Skjbo outlook. He was a member of the varsity squads of 27 and 28 and comes back to show, his wares tit for
ward. Wayne High rejoins the Tartan team to take the guardposition which he held last year, and when Julian Bond showed lip to reclaim his post at center cage followers set their hopes high for prospective glories in the coming season. Eph Crum will play his third year on the Tech squad this year and is expected to work at a forward position, and two valuable forwards of the 1928 squad,Bob Kilgore and Bill Brown, willbe back at their posts,. Other candidates who should prove to be good material are: Ralph Merton, center; Marvin Fox, guard or center; George Nease, guard; Arthur Weiss, forward, and Jim Traa, guard.
Schedule Sixteen Games The 1929 schedule includes a list of 16 games with nine of the outstanding quintets of the east. Pitt leads the schedule with three games, two of which will be played at the Pitt stadium. The first clash with the Panthers comes within a week after the first game of the season, January 11, and return games will be played January 23 and February 26.
Fivq teams have two dates on the schedule. They are West Virginia, Wash-Jeff, Penn State, Westminster and Geneva. The last 
games of the season will be played at Buffalo and Niagara, when the Skibos entrain for games with the University of Buffalo March 1 and 
University of Niagara March 2. The 1929 schedule follows:Jan. 4----------Waynesburg, awayJan. 5------West Virginia, awayJan. 8-----------Geneva, at homeJan. 11-----------------Pitt, stadiumJan. 12----------Penn State, awayJan. 16------------Wash-Jeff, awayJan. 23------ ---------Pitt, at homeJan. 25Westminster, at homeJan. 30-----------------Geneva, awayFeb. 13---------Westminster, away

RIFLE
This years rifle season is open* 
ing with a bigger turnout of \v6in* 
en than has ever been known in 
the W. A. A. history at Carnegie. 
Over 70 first year women have 
registered for the sport, a number of whom will be a great factor in filling the gap let I by the graduate participants in the sport.The rifle range, which has been in the process of repair for the last few weeks, is now ready for use and is in excellent condition. With tjie exception of four women, the entire squad of last year will again be out for practice.Isabelle Sheppard, M. M. 29, manager, urges all of last year's women who are still interested in the sport to conic out for the next practice, With the abundance of new material and six of the varsity teams of ten returning, it is expected that the rifle , squad will be in fine shape to meet the hard competition which will be offered by the ten teams already carded.
BASKETBALL
The small turnout for basketball has been far below the usual nunjr bcr of contenders at the. opening of the season. The junior class has fewer defendants than cither the sophomore or freshmen squads. With the unbeaten record which women of the class of 1929 hold, it is certain that this years interclass competition will be more 
pointed than . ordinarily, The honor of the class hangs in thp outcome of this years games, since the present -seniors have

there.; In fact, it would not have mattered^ much if Rockne had gone on the field and called the signals himself for his badly battered squad.^The Thirteen Jinx at LastThe last contest of the, season proved to -bo the: first defeat of thp entire season. Tcch took its downfall.op the chin from New York University 27-13, Carnegie was outplayed and have the satisfaction of knowing that it was a great team which beat them, but they were not tlie same team that .overcame iNotreT Dame and George* ;town. The team wasn't set for the battle mentally and this doesnt mean that tlie team was1 cocky or over-confident, for they were not, It is hard to rise up for two games in weekly succession, which the Tartans previously had done with little difficulty, but this one proved too many. Tech took the lead early in the game when Sweet scored the. first after catching a pass from Harpster.
Things' looked pretty good for a little while until 'Strong got. started, but this was not until the second half, for the.best N. Y. U. could do in the opening half was to tie the score in the last minute by completing a forward. In the second half Strong, who had already been picked as one of Harp sterrg. teammates on the mythical 
All-American eleven, ran wild and scored two touchdowns for the visitors. In the second half, Carnegie resorted to an aerial attack which netted them six more points. Harpster shouldreceive due mention for hisheroic work in the last two periods. With an injury which would have kept a less courageous player on the side lines, he < tbssed twenty-six passes of which twenty were completed. These, however, proved to be fruitless for the Violet team again came into possession of the ball and threw a pass for the last marker of the afternoon's battle. A few minuteslater the whistle blew ending the most successful season in the history of Plaid athletics.
The Campus Scout
(Continued from page 4)
back from last year and surely they have learned something since the first game last year. Captain 
White, an expert guard, .is back. But at that, some over to the 
Pitt Weekly office any time during the next few weeks and we will gobble up all the sheklcs you Tartans have to place on the SIcibo passers in their trio of battles against the Pitt Panthers. It seems that the Carnegie cagers have their hands full when they book Pitt for three games.The first time your scoutever saw a Carnegie basketball team play was in his highschool days, when Coach Ben
Lubic brought his Tartan five
down to Beaver Falls to take on Geneva, The Covenanters are an annual fixture on the Scotch cage schedule. When Coach Irwin invades Beaver Falls this year he had better be prepared for a real tuasle. Ken Loeffler, former Penn State College star and captain, who recently captained the Morry Five, is now coaching Geneva. This is his first year as a college mentor and with the excellent material he has on hand, will make it hot for any team that faces the Covenanters this season.
As the Carnegie student body slowly made its way put of Forbes 
Field after N. Y. U, game, little did it realize that it had seen its team' perform at the Pirate ball 
park for the last time for the next 15 years. For next year, Pitt 
starts playing host to Carnegie and her team. You can rest a?* sured that the Pitt athletic heads are merely sharing their bowl only 
to be accommodating. The benefits derived by both institutions arc great. Mr. Harrison of the Panther athletic department, deserves much credit, and Pitt should be glad to get a team of Carnegie Tcch's caliber to play half their games in the Pitt bowl.Since this is the only chance 
your scout will get to force his comments on the Carnegie students, he takes great pleasure in thanking *'Stew Ralston and Tom Lippert for the opportunity. While we are here the writer wishes to say hello to Mr. Overend and thanks him for all the past favors he has been so kind to do for the Pitt Weekly sports staff. We 
hope Coach Steffen does not lose a game next year, but wait, his boys play Pitt. Well, we hope he wins them all but the Pitt game, and we just couldnt go back on our friend, 
Jock Sutherland.

LETS END IT NOW
The recent presentation to Student Council of a petition signed by more than 800 students who ask the continuation of Campus Week may result in definite action on the annual question of spring student festivities. PresidentStauffer, of Student Council, has promised action on the petition after Christmas holidays.Wf like the attitude of students in bringing the issue before the school once again. We only ask that the problem be decided pro or con once and for all. That such a question has no need to recur each year to be the subject of cmbatlled controversy between council and faculty is evicent. The trouble over Campus Week should not occupy pcrenially the chambers of campus solons.The reason for our attitude is simple. We heartily believe that to discuss and re-discuss each year the same question is wasted effort. Unlike taxes and tariff, Campus Week need not be made the subject of annual controversy. Moreover, we are interested ii. the goo/1 relations which we think should exist between Student Council members and faculty and administration and which can be broken by such discussion each year as now takes place. Continual, strife over the Campus Week question will result some fine spring in a serious rift on the campus.No better decision on the question can be handed down next year or in the future. Time will not change the mind: of student members when there is no indication of their forgetting the festivities of past years. The petition which they have just presented is evidence of that fact.If then there is to be a definite decision on Campus Week after the holidays, as the President of Student Council has intimated, let the decision be binding for all time._ The Campus Week question put in somewhat the words of .a famous orator would ring: Giveus settlement or -wholly abolish it; evasion of the issue or indecision in action is fatal.
JUST GIVING UP
Without demonstration by either plebes or sophomores, the period of plebe regulations for the year ends today. It was supposedly a strenuous period and on that score those in charge of regulations justify the early discontinuance of rules for the current year. During Christmas vacation it is supposed that the plebes will "orientate" themselves to the student life of the school with an attitude amounting to gusto and dispatch.
The period of sophomore control over first year men ends much too early. The plebes have barely had time to know what the situation means. In a period of less than three months time they are supposed to^ have received the treatment which plebes in other years could not absorb in seven months' time. ^ Something is wrong.
It is with a defeatist spirit that the committee in charge of regulations gives up the cherished rules period. Without ceremony or demonstration, the sophomores announce the freedom of the plebe. Where before the event was marked with condcscention of sophomore leaders now it is barely noted as a passing news note. It evidently means little to give the plebes someone to thank and something to be thankful for.
But off-campus too there is a result.
To Pitt with its abandoned regulations the early abolition of rules on the Tartan campus is something of a blow. To it and to any attempts made lor the establishment of freshman rules, the pessimistic action of the Plaid cohorts might prove disastrous.*****
In the early abandonment of plebe regulations this year, we rccognize uppermost the 'fact that i-fee nrst-year men expected a larger
We bemoan the fate of the columnist. The object o all sorts of outlandish demands from his readers (such as there are), he is most venomously flayed by them if he attempts to act like a biped. He cannot color his observations with emotion without being branded sentimental; he must not respond normally to something that has impressed him unless he wishes to be labelled inane; he cannot even steal a rapture or two on the sacred clientele without a murmur of critical voices that slowly develops into a monotonous hiss, "Journalistic gew - gawsl Lotta gush, Filling space, shouts the dear public as it slings the paper into the corner intending to use it next morning to wrap papas lunch.
Well, maybe the dear public is right. But right or wrong, it is the dear publics fault that columnists arc the abnormal, perverted, carnivorous creatures they arc. Ad it is our critical and backbiting readers who must answer, for example, for the savage thrill we sensed as we placed foot upon the level soil , of this landofHarpster trees and Rosenzweig bushes. Sighs of relief were not unplcntiful as we. forsook the knob upon which our fostering mother was built years ago by the Zoobi cliff dwellers for this fertile table-land where boys in bare knees play music. Though we have been in this
period of control. They may not have done so with any degree of satisfaction but the fact remains that they probably did desire this longer period. Now we have a defeat of planned outcomes and the consequent dissatisfaction resulting thereform. If their actions are any indication, the plebes need more regulation. Prominent mem bcrs of the class have violated the edicts of sophomore guardians; it is rumored that even the class president may have some difficulty 
on this score.If regulations are dropped at this early date, wisdom demands that sophomores make something of the event. To attempt the enforcement of rules for a period such as they have and, then to abandon them without so much as giving the plebes a chance to murmur thanks is failing to make the best of an opportunity. _If the situation is such that the abandonment of regulations is deemed necessary then bring on the end. But it would seem more in line with the vaunted _ regulatory spirit of the Carnegie hosts to continue at least in part these rules for which the newspapers of the city find ample cause to play up on the slightest provocation as being worthy of good news space, and for which the Plaid hosts are widely known.
A PROBLEM
A junior at Dartmouth College imbued with the call of the wild and a displeasure with modern society has bid goodbye to his college and gone to begin life anew in the' woods. How long he will stay there he has not said.To all of us at some time or other comes a dislike for the life we lead. We may not follow the course of the Dartmouth junior in o\xf quest for the different. Yet the desire for self-expression or solitude is nevertheless strong. Like the Dartmouth student, we may see about us "professors pale-faced, eyes glazed, truly hopeless; studentsdull, tired, yawning, chafing at the system they are entangled in." We may dislike the system of mass education, the grasping of college presidents for bigger endowments, the life that offers^ us no real enjoyment.It is good at such times to remember that of our number there are those who delight in their work and see in the future a happy goal. Our lives depend upon us to make them what they are.
HERE YOU ARE, FOLKS
Whats it all about anyway? Here Carnegie Tech students find their campus newspaper edited by Pitt students. Last week the Pitt campus saw the appearance of its weekly under the tutelage of* Carnegie journalists.There is no need to justify the change of student news staffs. The ork which they have done in handling the affairs of another's paper has meant to them not only a change from tb? routine of theii own papers, but has given them an opportunity to work under conditions unfamiliar to them and thereby test the organization of each staff.Athletes, debaters, glee clubs and like organizations visit other schools to display their wares. It is with s-mewhat this purpose that the staffs of The Tartan and The Weekly approached their work, Endorsed by the heads of both schools the exchange o( staffs aids in the building up of good relationships between the two neighboring institutions.
And so when they ask us what it is all about and what the idea of exchange is we dont answer right off. Instead we think of the work of The Tartan staff at Pitt and the interest of Carnegie in us poor Pitt scribes.
CREDIT WHERE DUEThe sporting editor of a local daily has written in glowing and fitting terms of the two nationally famous football teams of Carnegie and Pitt. He brought the unusual fact that there is no one other city in the country boasting of two such teams as those of Carnegie and the Panthers.
He was right and we are glad that he recognizcd a situation in the field whereof he writes. But outside^ his field and off the football gridiron there is to be noted and commended the high ratings of these schools in. scholastic pursuits. The scholastic standards of the faculties, the physical equipment and the cultural attitude of the two schools is more worthy of note than that they had two excellent football elevenshowever highly he latter may be extolled.
new world but 2. few hours, we' 
must confess, with due respect to 
our alma mater up in the cliffs 
across the avenue, that we are 
glad to have had the opportunity to see other parts of a building than the roof. We have become so accustomed to birdeseye views that the normalcy of it all has 
made us dizzy.'X' >tNor was it easy for us to forsake our role of mountain goat for this brief respite. After having grazed so long at 5267 feet above sea level, we experienced untold nasal congestions and throat disorders as we descended into the bogginess characteristic of Pittsburgh down here nearer civilization. Indeed, no sooner did we enter Industries Building than we unconsciously dashed to the top floor only to find that the Tartan office was luxuriously situated in in the cellar. Cliff dweller will 
be cliff dweHers^^
The citizens of this community must bear the community stamp or other mark of recognition; for as soon as we entered the official boundaries, somebody smelled the blood of an infidel. In fact, a certain individual who wore a black tie and a funny little cap that was many sizes too small for him,- approached us and blandly remarked that Pitt profited by the swap. We agreed with the unripe fruit, telling him that we dickered also for Prexy Baker and $5,000 cash, but the deal fell through.
But our colleagues have really 
labored to produce a sheet that will make the genuine article proud to be called by the name it bears. They have worked unstintingly to give the dear public full value for the money, and have barred nothing but vermilion headlines and airplane views of SNchenley Oral. And they necessarily hope that the boys and girls in plaid, and especially the esteemed faculty, faculty, will deal less harshly with their efforts than a certain English instructor in a western school did recently with the official organ of that institution. He assigned to all his freshman English classes the happy task of picking the school paper apart and tabulatin the shortcomings. Out of a seeming profound esteem for the editor, the first-year weanlings fell to their work with the alacrity oi an airdale pouncing upon a fragment of round-steak (unground). As a result the editor thought a lot of evil thoughts and muttered many unkind mutterings about the instructor who had his goslings tear* the journalist limb from limb. There was no blood-shed, however, and the school still stands.
They are extremely naive out West. At Ohio University the campus highlights are up i;i arms over the administrations objections to student-driven cars. The students feel that their sense of proportion is being insulted by the 
worthy authorities who have their charges do their gallivanting on foot. The editor of the "Green and White, who probably drives his own LaSalle, is especially indignant and expresses his vexation thus:"Here, at Ohio University, students are permitted to drive their own cars. Thus far, authorities have had no cause for dissatisfaction. It may be that driving a car while in school takes a little time for recreation. However, opportunity for such a pleasant pastime can also give added impetus to a students scholastic standing. A students parents will very rarely let hi in keep a, car at school unless he is attaining an average of scholastic standing.It certainly is nice of the editor to feel this way about so ticklish a problem, though he may find in time that his philosophy is of the swiss-checsc variety..c1o15Mv vAf151o15The late Christy Mathewson would rest uneasily in his sarcophagus if he knew what was going on at his alma mater. A new fraternity has been founded at BucknellSigma Mu Mu, by nameby the inmates of Zeigler Memorial Infirmary, to which membership is exclusive. The perquisites for admission to this sacred order are novel, if a bit grotesque: Residence in the infirmary one week at least; a temperature of 100 degrees af^some time during ones residence in the infirmary, and a definite pulse rate to be determined by the Grand Akron. Another coup detat among the Greeks.
If any of you Plaid ladies and gentlemen have tried to see yourselves as others see you, you will appreciate some pointed observations which appeared in a recent issue of a current periodical. A member of the freshman class at Pembroke College, Mirium, Berma, who was born in Russia and educated at Palestine, chronicles her criticisms of American educational institutions with sufficient finesse to startle the most indifferent American college student. She states that students here worry too much about their grades and not enough about the general benefit they are deriving. She finds also that the professor and his lectures are much to blame for this condition. There seems to be no effort to introduce new, stimulating elements intoclass work. From year to year, in American colleges, the students keep expecting the professor to put them to sleep; and the professbr in turn expects to be confronted with a bunch of nincompoops. Since both elements live up to their expectations, no change is wrought This young observer contends that our colleges need new blood; new blood in students to respond to courses that are really interesting and new blood in professors to give their classes something in response. Whether the remedy of this Pembroke scholar is adequate is hard to say; that the diagnosis is sound, however, is beyond question.
But we have had our say, dear public, and have said nothing. But what can a cliff dweller accomplish without his cliffs? Many thanks, however, for your indulgence; and even though your money cannot be refunded at the box office, we slink back to our hilly haunts with a good opinion of the Scotch.
JUST NOSING AROUND
THINK IT OVER
The most precious thing a student lias in his four years of college is his leisure. This leisure, however, is so cut into by athletic, social and other extra-curricular activities that what little spare time he may have left is necessary to aid in his recuperation from the effects of a strenuous athletic or social season.
Probably at no time before or after his' collegiate life will a student have so much available time to improve himself intellectually. There should be a concerted attempt to place some limit on athletic, fraternity and social intru
sions upon the students time. The most priceless possession a school can have is not an unbeaten football team, or beautiful grounds, or a Cathedral of Learning, or priceless equipment, or a heavy endowment. The spirit of the school would seem to lie in the utter freedom of thought and discussion.
A recent incident in Pittsburgh .attracted the attention of quite a number of people as well as the press. In most cases of this sort the school authorities say that they do not oppose free speech but are simply opposed to the "dissemination of radical propaganda. While this must be true, 
there does not seem to be an equally alert solicitude to prevent the spread of conservative propaganda. A well-known economic authority in an eastern university has observed that conservative: propaganda even among members of the faculty, is not only tolerated but more or less encouraged and after a time rewarded.
We must distinguish between freedom of thought and freedom of action. Nearly every one recognizes that society must place limits upon action. If one seizes anothers property or violates the personal integrity of another by striking or killing him the law must, of course, step in, sometimes with the aid of psychiatry with possibly a remedial rather than a punitive road. No university is worthy of respect if it places any restrictions upon the
freedom of thought, inquiry and discussion.History, has repeatedly shown, as at the time of the inquisition, that it is those things which the "gentlemen running the show have claimed to be' true should have been subjected to the severest scrutiny. The human mind should rid itself once and for all of the habit of accepting anything, ecclesiastical, political, economic, or anything else upon the dogmatic authority of anyone.In an idle moment which may occur for the student between the profound important events of the rushing season, some student might consider the thought that it is not a mere accident that the motto of the British Royal Society is "Take nobodys word for anything. Rather than authority, ecclesiastical or political, as a test of truth, everything should be subjected to the test of experiment, verification, and comparison. This is the essence of scientific spirit as contrasted with lawfully constituted dogma in any realm.The nonconformist, the dissenter, the voice in the wilderness, and the heretic may be a very bad creature, but he is never uninteresting. And he travels in a distinguished company among them, Christ, who was crucified as a nonconformist dissenter, Socrates, who was compelled to drink poison for corrupting the youth of Athens, Bruno who was consigned to the flames for ecclesiastical heresy, and countless others. It would be idle to suggest that the nonconformist is always right, or even so in a majority of cases; it would be equally difficult to attempt ,to maintain that whatever is, is right, or the most expedient meth of doing things.The crucially important thing is this: quite apart from -the question of accuracy or inaccuracj-, an individual in a university or a democracy should never place the slightest limitation upon the free exchange of ideas, or upon the freedom of thought, inquiry, discussion. and publication.
BLOWN IN THE WINDSCHOLASTIC SLEEPING
Two liars tell me they never average more than six hours sleep out of the twenty-four. Anyone who stays awake eighteen hours a day will naturally find time for lying and mischief. Nor do these insomniacs ever do well in their studies.Dr. Sigmund Screamcauld, in his little pamphlet, Classroom Snoozing, notes this fa.ct:"Every good student I have ever had has slept through all my lectures. The wide-awake nuisance is forever chattering, glancing out the window and otherwise disturbing the class.Dr. Screamcauld goes on to say that chronic snoozing is especially necessary for the' proper attitude in social science, philosophy and psychology classes. He explains that sleep is merely a protective stupor inherited from our savage ancestors who dozed off in times of danger or hardship. We sleep at night because, it was best for them to be quiet at night."And, as the doctor very justly remarks, it is best for the student to be quiet in class.What better method could be devised for meeting the requirements of the modern university classroom than this primitive stupor passed down to us from rehistoric times? The student need only cultivate and adapt his inherited ability to doze."His classroom attitude will improve. And out of class, he will be able to cover twice as much material in such subjects as philosophy and history. He will be
come in every respect a more
social creature, less inclined to disputation and mischief.* * * *
A GENTLE THING
"Women also realize the purposes to which sleep may be put. They discreetly doze off at amorous moments, leave their modesty to Morpheus and the rest to you."

YOURE ALWAYS RIGHT
I am _ always right. You are always right. He is always right.- We are always right. They are always right.
At times I make mistakes in the expression of my thoughts; but my thoughts are always correct. If, because I have spilled ink on a term paper, I call my kid brother an impudent little puppy dog and shove him downstairs, my words and actions may not express exactly what I intend; they are merely my inexact way of expressing the thought that I am vexed at having skilled ink on my term paper.If I refer to a member of the (Pitt) administration as a pigheaded bureaucrat, my statement may not be an absolutely dependable description. lie may only act like a pig-headed bureaucrat. Or perhaps I am merely trying to say 
that I didnt enjoy my breakfast.As a matter of fact, I do not believe I referred to any member of Pitts administration as a pigheaded bureaucrat in my last weeks column (which the editor saw fit not to publish.) Nor do I recall describing certain members of Pitts student body as spineless porcupines. Those epi
thets, as a remember, were not
CONTRIBS
To the Editor of The Tartan:
The football programs of Car
negie Tech could certainly be improved. They are a discredit to our school. They are poor in arrangement, lacking in information, and superfluous in the number of advertisements. We pay 25 cents for 36 pages, six of which actually contain information regarding the football game. The editor seems to entirely forget that the objeer of a football program is to give information about the avo teams and schools. Perhaps the present football program is not printed lor the benefit of the football fans, but as a commercial means to get moneyl The placing of the lineupsand substitutions is disconcerting . enough to make one throw away the program in disgust. The numbers and positions of the players on the two teams are on different pages separated by another page. At a very exciting moment we look down at the program to see which playei is carrying the ball. The program is opened at the opposing lineup If we tear out the offending center page the book comes apart. Was there ever a more stupid arrangement?
The glaring errors of our football programs may be shown by comparing the publication with that of another school. It might be well for the editor to attend our hilltop neighbors football games and buy himself a program. Their football program is actually a football program, not a conglomeration of advertisements with a scanty, space-crowded lineup, and a few pictures scattered here and there. Songs, yells, cheers and players pictures of "both' schools fill all the pages except the double center page. One side of the double page is allotted to each team. At the top appears, the probable lineup with the names, numbers and positions of the players arranged in actual formation.It certainly is a help to the giris who can never remember the difference between tackle or guard halfback or fullback. Under this, in chronological ' number order come the names, positions, weight, height, age and preparatory school of each substitute. There is no need to turn pages, all the necessary information can be gained from a glance at the double center page. In the center of this sheet there is a space for the score, by quarters, under which is placed the list of officials. This program certainly shames our football programs which have a six by four inch space for the lineup and substitutions, no information about the opposing team except a scanty lineup and 30 pages 
of advertisements that nobody is interested in.Do we, Carnegie sludents, realize that Pitt excels us in having football programs far, far superior to ours.' What are we going to do about it, Tech?

among the expressions I employed.But whatever it was I did say had the right spirit behind it, I feel sure. And yet, the editor was perfectly justified in suppressing it; that was merely his inaccurate way of expressing an accurate truth.He was right. I was right. You were right. As a matter of fact we all were right.

RIGHT AGAIN
Which is doubtless only my inaccurate way of saying that I enjoyed my breakfast this morning. Indeed, I feel so genial that I must close my column with some nice though inaccurate expression of good-will, such as referring to the Tech campus as the Campus of Beautiful Women.As a matter of fact, there arent any more good-lookingwomen over here than we have at home; but as Aiice Harding points out, 
you see more of them.
BOOKS IN REVIEW
Wc are strangers. Of me you 
know neither age nor sex; neither 
backgrounds nor foibles. Of you I 
know equally little. Vour reading 
may be bounded in the morning by 
the back half of the Post-Gazette 
and in the evening by the Literary 
Digest. Your favorite may be 
The Cherry Orchard, "Lora Jim," 
and "The Faerie Queene. Who 
knows? But lets pretend.
Lets pretend I have a warm room, with comfortable places for sitting, on the hill above Center avenue. My friend Claude has spoken of you, the couple from Carnegie Tech. He suggests that I stay at home Saturday evening; with you and his girl friend he will ring the bell at about 8:30. When we have talked awhile, Ill move behind a screen. There will be coffee, Roquefort sandwiches, and little sugar shells plump with custard.Claude and I have our best moments when^lone. He will say very little after the introductions. Ruby will sit with him, hts hand hovering close. You, I understand, are like most "Tech' students, 1 know: attractive, intelligent, gay on occasions, very easy to talk to. Paul and Louise may be your names. Paul studies engineering; he talks vaguely of designing dynamos. Louise would like to be an actress; she majors, however, in dietetics. You are not arty, praise be, but this fall you have learned to find pleasure in the arts Reading, listening, and seeing increase your keenness in each other. Claude met you at the International Art Exhibit; he saw you at a symphony; he ran into you at the library. lie wants me to know you.I am a booker, as you realize as soon as you have stumbled over a pile of "Vanity Fairs just inside the door, picked volumes from the chairs to which I have waved you, and seen the mosaic of greens, blues, whites, and browns of my shelves. 
If I am to do much talking, it will be about books. My standards you will find experimental; my attitude, enthusiastic rather than rational.One of you, perhaps Louise, has taken the chair beside the narrow table on which sprawl the things 1 am reading. The jackets are brilliant; white slips tuft the top of one volume; the titles indicate fiction, poetry, biography. One glance of interest, one question, one reach
ing forth of a hand will loose what is in my head to say. This I write, with loss of spontaneity 
and informality.I."Do you recall the "Vanity Fairs you stumbled over? One of the main reasons I buy the magazine is -to read "John Riddells book reviews. Ill explain.Literature is usually a serious business. Witness the dissections offered weekly in "The Saturday Review of Literature, Books, "The New York Times Book Review; witness the brave pleas for sweetness and light; witness the English professors straightened shoulders and clenched fists at mention of Shakespeare and Wordsworth.Occasionally, however, a jovial individual laughs into the sanctum, juggles books, and haw-hoos at what he reads. He parodies. His fun spreads; our ribs palsy with appreciation. But isnt he harmful? Well, "Mpther India may suffer in suchburlesque, but I notice no diminution of respect for "The Bridge of San Luis Rey. To poke fun atbooks and authors is certainly as legitimate as to poke fun at thepresidential flutter, or the antics oi Aimec, or the peddling of ;milk in Alumni Hall. *"John Riddell, you may have guessed, has something to do with an unorthodox attitude towards books. His real name is said to be Corey Ford, claimed by a celebrated young humorist. In "Meaning No' Offense (Day, $2), he writes a burlesque survey of the yearspopular books.To the "stoep of Mrs. Ethel Reader came Trader Riddell holding in his hand a cluster of brand new Best Seller?. Mrs. Reader wondered if he could tell her allabout the books, so she would not have to read them. For her Trader t wrote a conversation between Eugene ONeill and his inner self, about a proposed century play; a monologue by The Man Who Knew Lewis; an expose of the sex life, crime and desolation in America, in the manner of Katharine Mayo; a renovanftn of companionate marriage, comparative marriage; a William Beebe essay on "Do Fishes Perspire? And there is more.At least two exhibits must be disword."This is a bumptious book, more full of sheer wango and utter pht! than you are likely to find in a days march in search of crumpets. . . . The 
mixture of liggish phrasings with sayings so incomparably wog make for a dish that will zigger the appetites of the most hohum.and a poem from the chapter on
Samuel Iioffensteins "Poems in 
Praise of Practically Nothing*"
"The curfew tolls the knell of 
parting day;
The lowing herd winds slowly 
oer the lea;
The plowman homeward plods 
his weary way,
And love is a kick in the slats.
Caricatures of authors by Covarrubias detract nothing irom the ziggering.
II.Already, I fear, "Books has lost readers. The scholarly and serious have been irritated; the young and hot-blooded have been bored. But the sound of my voiceill writing, of coursenever wearies my own cars. Later on I may shout loudly enough about another tiook to regain an audience.HI.The most-advertised book of December will probably be Arnold Zweigs "The Cast of Sergeant Grisella  (Viking, $2.50), chosen by the Book-of-thc-Month Club. YVliat is it?Early in 1917, the eastern front was quiet; Russia was reshaping; the prisoner Grisella wanted to cross 
the. lines to his family. He escaped from caijrp. But it Was winter, and the front was not as close as he had hoped. Forest brigands accepted him ; the woman Babka loved him ; they planned his escape in the spring.. He took the name of Private Bjuscheff, a deserter Avho had wandered for montns behind the German lines.Caught, Grisella was accused of espionage and condemned to die. Then he confessed his identity. He was a simple fellow, likeable, wellfeatured, willing to work. In his 
case General von Lychow took interest. Grischa was innocent of the charge; to shoot him would be injustice. A few.x legal steps would save him. But the documents came to General Schic Tei./.onn. "The individual is a louse, was his philosophy. For disciplinary reasons, Grischa must die. The individual has nothing to do with justice. The State creates justice. Around Grischas case then arises a struggle between opposing concepts of civilization. All mankind is involved. Grischas case is a German SaccoVanzctti case.The material supporting the story of Grischa is fresh and informative. There was a German side to the war; there were conflicting ideas behind the lines; there was German life reacting to the catastrophe. Of this the war books w : have read have said nothing. And that this is propaganda, 1 cant believe. I can find, then, at least two reasons for reading The Case of Sergeant Grisella: the story and the information. Arc there no blemishes? Yes, in common with most continental fiction, the book is often weighty and discursive. Do I object? I do not.Perhaps a warning is needed : if you are afraid to be deeply stirred, to lose complacency, avoid this book.IV.The book I am coming to is from the Modern Library. Unless you are acquainted with these small, wellprinted, fabrikoid-bound, inexpensive volumes, you aint seen nothin yet. The present list includes 150 titles. Among them are "Tristram Shandy, "De Profundis, "Sons and Lovers, "Zuleika Dobson, "Jungle Peace, "Madame Bov-ry. This is not advertising.V."The Art of Whistler (Modern Library, $0.95) lias nothing to do with the band piece, "The Whistler and His Dog. Though there are, I know from experience, individuals unmoved by the name James Abbott MNcill Whistler, most readers of this column will rccognize it as that of a famous artist and a famous man. (I admit frightful obviousness.) Of his life and art Mrs. Elizabeth Robins 'Pennell, one of his close friends and :3-ai.tnor with her late husband of the "Life of Whistler, has written an account that I do not hesitate to c'\ll absorbing.There arc comma splices, pages of them, but there are also anecdotes and plain statements of fact of a man who once said he Iiad no private life. People were curious of all he did; and his laugh, his white hat, his letters to the press, his "splashes of paint were to the last quarter of the nineteenth century what it takes Peggy Hopkins Joyce, Cari Van Vechten, Picasso, and James Joyce to be today.His paintings, however, show that he was more than a public figure. Extreme modernists find in him much to belittle, but no one can deny the serious sincerity with which he manipulated lines, masses, and colors. His "Mother and "Carlyie are well known. His Pablo Sarasate hangs in Carnegie Institute. His other works, especially his nocturnes and etchings, deserve more frequent reproduction. Thirty-two of his paintings, lithographs, etchings, and water-colors are shown in aquatone in this book. And unlike most titles in the Modern Library, this is not a reprint, but a book 
especially written for the series.
