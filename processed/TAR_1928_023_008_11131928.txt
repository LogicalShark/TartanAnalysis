Tartans Score Decisive Win Over 
Georgetown University at Albany 
New York, Saturday, in 13-0 Battle
Karcis Plunges Ball Over 
For First Touchdown. 
Eyth Also Stars
TARTANS COMPLETELYOUTPLAY HILLTOPPERS
Harpster Shows Great Generalship;Rosenzweig Also Produces Brilliant Display
Outplaying the Georgetown eleven in every department of the game, the Big Red team from Carnegie Institute:' of Technology handed Coach Lou Little's outfit their first 
defeat of the season last Saturday at Chadwick Park Stadium, Albany, 
New York. The Tartans certainly proved to the , few remaining skeptics that they were a real football machine, and that the smallest thing in their repertoire was their reputation. Carnegie-knocked the Blue and Gray from the 'top rung of the grid ladder to the tunc of a 13-0 scorc, the touchdowns, one made by Karcis f and the other by Ted Rosenzweig, coming in the first and third quarters. The game was played on a muddy, snow-covered field and before a very small crowd of spectators, considering the fact the game was played between two j teams neither of which had tasted 
; defeat heretofore.
Capt. Harpster led his men in his usual calculating manner, in addition to outpunting Mooney so badly that it was really pitiful. Eyth and Karcis fairly tore the Blue and Gray forward wall to : jlieces by alternating at center plunges and olf-tackle bucks. Rosenzweig* certainly displayed an over amount of ability in repeatedly making substantial gains on end around plays and in snaring 
passes from Ilarpster.
HaVpstci* won the toss and dci cidcd to defend the north goal. Mooney kicked off to Moorehead, who ran the ball back to the Carnegie 24-yard line. Moorehead again carried the ball and ran 20 yards around right end before being downed. Carnegie failed to make it first down and Harpster punted to Iiannigan, who was 
downed on his own 21-yard line. Georgetown failed to gain and Mooney attempted a punt, but it was partially blocked by Schmidt, the ball rolling to the Carnegie 45-yard line. Carnegie fumbled and the ball was recovered by Georgetown. Two plays later Flanagan intercepted Iludaks pass, this giving rise to the inarch that resulted in the first touchdown. Karcis gained two yards on a pass. Moorehead was forced out of 
bounds on a no-gain play. Flanagan gained four yards around left :nd on a reverse play. Moorclcad gained nine yards on an end un. Rosenzweig gained six yards .on two end around plays, the ball coming to rest on the two-yard line. Harpster ran into a pileup, but Karcis tore through offguard for the first touchdown. Harpster place-kicked for the extra point.In the sccond quarter Georgetown made their greatest threat, bringing the ball to the Skibfts two-yard line on a series of passes and bucks, plus numerous Carnegie penalties. The Tartan line 
held, however, and it was Carnegies ball when the half ended.In the third quarter Eyth ran wild, scarcely failing to gain whenever lie carried the ball. On an exchange of punts Carnegie started a relentless drive from her 43-j'ard line.,. The Karcis-Eyth combination was largely responsible for carrying the ball to the 26-yard line, a: which point Ted Rosenzweig took the ball on an end around play for the second touchdown. This brilliant run was a featurei
ni the gamfe, as he shook off two icondary defense men and finally (Continued on Page 3)

Mr. Lennox Robinson 
Dublin to Direct Play 
of Drama Department
The Pleasure Garden by B. Mayor Will Be Produced for First Time in United States
In January the Department of 
Drama will produce a play under 
the direction of Lennox Robin
son, Director of the Abbey Theater 
in Dublin. Mr. Robinson, who is 
now in this country on a lecture 
tour, has been engaged for the 
entire month of January as visiting 
director of the drama department, and on this visit Mr. Lepnox of the Abbey Theater in Dublin will direct production of a play.The next play to be produced in the Little .Theater is a .four-act comedy, The Pleasure Garddn," by Beatrice Mayor. The play, under the direction of. Professor Viclimann, will be given the week before Thanksgiving vacation and will run for the usual eight performances.'The Pleasure Garden has never been produced in the United States though it "was performed at the Regent Theater in London in 1924. It is. the work of an English woman, whose only other literary creation is a one-act play which, like The Pleasure GArdcn, has been produced in England.The plan, the scene of which is in a public garden in England, has rather a sketchy plot, dealing with a students observation of human life. Its chief interest lies in character delineation.A large cast is called for by the play; it will include about a half of the upper class members of the Drama Department The roles have not yet been assigned, but after the readings, which are being held this week, the cast will be an
nounced.
Work Nearly Completed
On Student Directory
The student directory, which was to have made its appearance today, has been delayed for a few days. Due to extensive proofreading necessary to eliminate mistakes, the booklet will not be ready till Thursday or at the very latest, Tuesday, the twentieth. Notices will be posted on the bulletin boards announcing the correct dates of the sale. There 'are only 750 copies to be printed so that anyone wishing to reserve ar copy of the directory can do so by placing his order and the price, 50 cents, with Bill McNeill,. Bob Wood or Helen Booth.All 'students who desire to sell student directories should see Bob4 Wood, the business manager, at once at the Tri-Publications office or at the Sigma Phi Esilon Fraternity on Forbes street.
Plebe Ratings Show Up Well 
0ver220QualityPointsMade 
By Twenty-nine Girls-Boys
The freshman ratings for the first six weeks of the first semester have shown up fairly well for a group just acclimatized to college atmosphere. This year there are 29 boys and 19 girls whohave 220 or more quality points. The highest number of quality points registered are those of Miss Edith Turner of M. M. C. C. The highest number of points in the bo3rs group were made by Robert W. Ivamerer. Though there are less girls than boys above the 200 mark there must be taken into account the fact that the total number of units carried by the girls are 50, while the boys carry from 55 to 
,61. In the opinions of the college directors those rating compare favorably with last years. They also expect to have many more names on  this list by the end of the'semester.The following is a list of the (Continued on Page 4)

Department will read the Scriptures. The _ music is to be furnished by a string quartette. Thanksgiving hymns will be sungDr. Van Etten, one of the most prominent ministers of Pittsburgh and well-known to Carnegie students, has visited the chapel exercises of previous years. The Y. W. and Y. M. C. A. arrange for Chapel programs every two weeks. Irene La Londe, a senior in the Secretarial Department, has charge of the current chapel program. The attendance so far has been very unsatisfactory. Students in tlieY. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. again urge every one to attend these services.
Institute Exhibit Mecca For Art Critics
And Lovers of Cultural Pittsburgh
Pittsburghers starving for culture 
are wending their way towards the 
Carnegie Institute art exhibit, where, 
with wide-open eyes they drink in 
the beauties of Nature as portrayed I by the exponents of art.With catalogues in hand, schoolchildren,,. club women, college students, and afternoon dates promenade through the galleries and survey the works of the worlds greatest artists. They, after a glance, cither voice their approval, or, with wcllselcctcd witticisms, label the paintings /"fit for the woodshed.Tcachcrs who desire to instill the love of culture in the hearts of their pupils send them to the exhibit to write on The Six Best Paintings 'in the Art Exhibit, in a composition of two hundred words. These children solemnly pace the galleries dis-' carding tbe prue winners as impossible, and pick out for the best paintings pictures of mother and babe,
flowers, or sea-scenes. Then they ask the lady-in-charge and the guards to help them compose something that will show that their carfare money wasnt wasted. With an air of affluence they ask the price of pictures and are cither crestfallen or retire to consider possible purchase.The first prize winner receives practically no favorable comment and is referred to as bunch of dead ducks by both young and old folks. The only small child who admired the prize winner, said that the painting was a difficult task, because, since the ducks lay on the table upside down, the artist had to paint cacn feather standing on his head.The paintings of the moderns, indiscriminately referred to as being futuristic, cubistic, or impressionistic, are blessed with some adjectives denoting one of the stages of abnormal behavior.

Carnegie Men Fly To 
Albany To View Game
Seven students and ,a professor, 
members of the Aviation Club, went 
to the Georgctown-Carnegie game 
in Albany last Saturday in two 
Ryan monoplanes belonging to the 
Aircraft and Airways Company of 
America. The entire trip from 
Pittsburgh, via Buffalo and into 
Albanjr, was made bjr air. They 
were: Professor Klamon of the
Economics Department, with R. M. 
Weiglt, D. M. Mel lor, E. J. Dolan, 
W. C. Vickery, E. P. Knudsen, 
Gerard Flynn and W. T. Hull.
The eight passengers were picked 
up at school Friday morning by 
automobiles from the Studebaker 
Corporation in Pittsburgh and 
taken to Rogers Field, where they 
took off in the planes at 3 
oclock.
The ships followed a route by 
way of Buffalo, on account of the 
unfavorable weather along the 
Allegheny Mountains, which was 
avoided by going _ directly north and then cast. Arriving at Buffalo about 5 oclock the party stayed over night. They left Buffalo at 8 oclock Saturday morning, reaching Albany at 10:30. In Albany the group was met again by Studcbaker automobiles and taken to a hotel.
The monoplanes used in the trip were Ryan-Mahoney Aircraft Corporation planes, manufactured at San Diego by the makers of Lindberghs Spirit of t. Louis.
P.esiden ial Ebction h Over So Oil Well 
For N_x. Fcur Yca:s And Ba Piospsrous
Apparently Republican prosperity" is 
here for at least four more years. 
Twenty-two million so decreed lastTuesday, and, despite the protests of seventeen million others, prosperity won out. The hitch lies in the fact that the presidential candidate is chosen by a majority vote, and since twenty-two million is five million more than seventeen million Gcckclcrian hypothesisHoover was elected.
Now that the fate of the''nation has been settle^ for the nextfour years, the American people can turn on their radios in peace. Since last June the air has been filled with meahingless promises which will promptly be forgotten now that the election is over. Everyone is glad that the Clicquot Club Eskimos anu the Philco Hour will be back broadcasting in place of the Hoover Rash Promises Club and the Smithsonian 'Anvil Chorus. Perhaps we may even be able to listen to a speech given in the best ofEnglish for a change.
Perhaps our newspapers will soon etunr to normalcy. -Of course well have to put up with From Engineer to President in Twenty Years or some such biography of the president-elect. But after tlie initial installment, the story will be put back beside the Frank & Seder advertisement and we wont notice it. Sports events will again bccomc the main issue and interesting murders will
probably take the place of religious 
toleration. To us, the doings of 
Howard Harpster, Red Cagle, and the. other all-Americans are far more interesting than why the man who has fed Tammany Hall for the last eight years is better than the man who fed the starving Belgians ten years ago.Business conditions will prgbably be bettered. The average husband has been coming home to a vacant dinner table ever since the Democrats left Houston. His wife has been all excited over a political parade or hadnt cjnvinced the corner grocer that the man who wants no votes on religious grounds is better than the man who wanted no votes on acc'ount of religion. (Both of them woulcl have grabbed the Mohammedan vote if they could have). Every man approached in business wanted to-wait until after the election before buying or selling the family tooth brush. If the Republicans were elected, the business man claimed everything would be oil right, if the Democrats won out, everything (would be all wet. Today, oil men are happy.And so the people have made a choice on their own volition, persuaded no doubt by six-shooters in Chicago, and the Strip gang in Pittsburgh, but theyve made a choice. But, no matter who is President, well wager that you and I are going to get the same substantial F in math, just the same.
Fourth of Series of Talks 
On the Art Exhibit Tonight
Dr. Frederick M. Clapp of FineArts Department, University of Pittsburgh, to be the Speaker
Dr. Frederick M. Clapp, Head of the Department -of Fine Arts, University of Pittsburgh, will speak in the Lecture Hall of the Carnegie Institute tonight on the International Exhibition on the subject, What Can We Know About It? This will be the fourth of the series of Tuesday evening talks on the Exhibition.
Dr. Clapp came to the University of Pittsburgh in 1927 to establish a department in tlie appreciation of the Fine Arts. This department .already ranks with the best in in the United States. Their library is rapidly becoming complete and authoritative. .It is devoted to art criticism and information.Dr. Clapp is recognized as one of the great scholars and writers on the history and meaning of art. He is a graduate of Yale University and lias a degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Paris. Afttr being graduated from Yale he went to Europe for further studyi He became interested in Italian art, and then in the his(Continued on Page 3)
Last Thistle Pictures 
Will Be Taken Thursday
Thursday will be the last day for taking pictures for the 1929 Thistle. Those who have not made arrangements to be photographed must communicate with Edwin Del Villar, the photographer, in order that all work may be done before lie leaves Thursday night. He may be reached either by a personal visit to Room 2, Industries Building or by calling Carnegie Tech and asking for Mn Del Villar. His office hours 'are from 9 to 11:40 and 1:30 to 4:45. If 'necessary he is willing to. be at his office in the evening alter 7:30 
in order that there will be no disappointed Seniors.
Settings for groups not yet photographed can be arranged for by the officers of the organization for whatever time is convenient. Itis important that appointments be made at once so that photographs may be made before the inevitable last minutes rush which results in a decrease of quality.A dollar deposit is required for each sitting for a picture for the Senior section, and Seniors are asked not to forget it.

Kilties Will Accompany 
The Team to South Bend
Sixty members of the Kiltie Band 
are looking forward to the big trip 
of the year this Friday to South 
Bend, Ind., where they will see the 
Notre Dame and Carnegie Tech 
game. Many seniors remember the 
royal time had on the trip to 
Notre Dame three years ago. There 
is much to' remember from that 
trip for the band was treated the 
best it has ever been treated. The 
Notre Dame students and people 
of South Bend regarded Carnegie Tech as their guest, and felt that it was their duty to see that Carnegie had a good time; this accounted for the splendid spirit displayed in South Bend.The Studebaker Motor Company put a fleet of cars at the disposal of the band for them to see the town. Besides this', they took the band through their factory  and gave them anything they wanted in the cafeteriar-That evening after the football game the Notre Dame Band gave a large banquet in honor of the Kiltie Band. All -of these events went together to make it one of the trips to long be re-- membcred.

Aeronautical Engineering Department
Receives a Gift of a Giant Aeroplane
The thrill of a new experience is always intensified when one knows that very few others are having that same experience. Years ago, ones first ride in an automobile was something looked forward to with a restless eagerness, and ooked back upon for few were fortunate enough to experience the sensation,- with pride. Today it.is the aeroplane that causes the anticipation and subsequent feeling accomplishment. Is the rare and much coveted ride that is obtained.Usually, however, one feels privileged if he can merely get a elose view of a plane. At present a ride in the air is a little above the reach of the average person.No doubt, students who arc busy with coming midsemesters do not know that you have only to express the wish for being within a stones throw of an aeroplane and your wish will be granted. For there is an teroplane on the Carnegie Tech Campus 1 If you should happen to
be secretcly ashamed of never having closely viewed a modern flying machine, perhaps you can cleverly plan to pay your visit at a time when there is least likely to be any one else there. You can go to see our aeroplane, and; yes, actually touch the machine, thus treating yourselves to the sort of thrill that you have not experienced since childhood.
But to come to details concerning our possession. Colonel Harry C. Fry, Jr., president of Loguc Broth
ers, Inc., has given the plane to the school to be used for the purpose of study by students taking the aeronautics branch of the mechanical engineering coursc. It is approximately nine years old, havipr been built for use during the wur. Unfortunately, the war ended too soon, and the machine was never destined to spread its wings. Now It is considered too unwieldly to be taken up.

CARNEGIE DOLLAR DAY 
TO BE NOVEMBER 27
Each year we celebrate Carnegie Day in memory of the birthday of our. founder. Last year at this time the day took on an added significance due to the fact that it was designated as Carnegie Dol
lar Day,In November, 1927, the first Carnegie Dollar Day was inaugurated, the plan being to ask each alumnus and former student to contribute $1 on or before this day to be put into the Carnegie Dollar Day Fund. The. plan was suggested by John 
L. Porter, one of our most prominent Trustees and Chairman of the Committee on the Institute of Technology. It was at once accepted by the Alumni Federation Board as being a very excellent and pleasant means of raising, money for the Endowment 1 Fund. The Alumni Office acts solely as the agent in this affair and does not benefit in any way from the money collectedevery dollar goes to the Fund.This year Carnegie Dollar Day has been set' as November 27 (not November 23, as was printed in last weeks Tartan). Dollars have commenced to ..come in already, and we have more than 68 -contributions so far. That isnt much in. proportion to what wc hope to receive, but it is a start, and we are grateful to these faithful early contributors. Certainly each alumnus and former student can, afford to send in his check, made payable to the Alumni Federation, or one of those green backs which slide out so easily from the bill 
fold, and never miss it. Consider the many ways you will unhesitatingly spend one dollar.- Can there be a more worthy, cause than this one of your Alma Maters? One dollar from each person may seem rather trivial, but stop to realize what they mean when sent in as a lump sum to the Endowment Fund.
As a result of thei contributions sent in for the First Carnegie Dollar Day, we were able last January to send a check for $600 * to the Endowment Fund Committee, and they figured that this amount would mean $1,608 for the Endowment Fund in 1946, so you can appreciate how much your dollars are going ^ to m^an to Carnegie Tech. This year we hope to at least double . the amount and posHcy, Hey! Hi Jim! Lo Bill! 
Well, gosh,, if it isnt Alex! Gee, 
you got much stouter ! Here comes 
an old grad. Gee, he traveled quite 
a way to get here. Doggone look at that mob. They're gonna make themselves whoopee. They iave some layout herewhos play.in? Oh, thats 
the Collegiate Six. Pretty nice  of them. Sounds like real old times. Red Goddcii sure had a keen foresight. I dont know where hed put all this mob if he had this reunion somewhere on the campus. Sli! sh! Buddys rrfakin a speech. Will they ever quiet down? Now, Buddys asking everybody' if they arc in lavor of another party. And how  he means next year. Vocifcrous praise and comment. Everybody consents by howling aye! Oh, what a racket; applause, whistling shrieks, stamping, yelling, loud laughter. Whoopee! thats the scotch for choopce. Bob Nation has the floor. Hes announcing something. Tell us about the entertainment. Miss Pennsylvania gives a song and dance number. O. K, she gets a big hand, more noise. Now wc are delightfully entertained by ' two pretty babies, something about I Cant Give You Anything But Lovirt. Now they do a dance. Theyre good. More applause and noise. A graceful young couple take to a beautiful waltzy number. Everybody happy, more rackcf. Bobs still announcing.Whose that guy that gives a big yell? Sounds like a Western Maryland freight blowing for a cow. The class of 1908 must have come out to a man. Theyre occupying a long table up there in front of the music. Occasionally .an old grad gets up to lead a yell at this table. Jack Beatty, sittin in the corner, laughing hard. Bob Nations .still announcing enter
tainment. Dont know where to look to. Tryin* awful hard to cat chicken and dance. The musicsget tin hot. More grads coming in. Where are they puttin them all? Red Godden still busy satisfying customers. Atta boy, Red! More noise, rackct. The class of 1908 enjoys a private dance.
The floors theirs now. Horns tootin, more noise; still coming in. Bill Phouts enters. Every cliss is now fully represented. Oh, theres Sonny Kessner. Bob Nation is still announcing. A circle is formed. Noise yelling. A few of the boys have the floor to entertain. Big surprise! Alumni exhibits some real talen in dancing. O. K. Noise. Still dancing strong. So much excitement. Cant cat my ice cream. We have readied the hand shakin stage. Everybodys visiting. Hey! hey! gcttih funny.Cheers for Steftcn, _ Waddell. Cheers for the team. Right in the midst of a monster loeomotive yell. Gee, this gang can sure yell. More pep. Bert Munhall draws nine rahs. Everybody cheering hard. This is real Carnegie spirit. Dear Old Tech is struck up. Everybodys lips are moving. Boy, oh boy, this 
gang is the crowd that wrote this song. No wonder they sing it from their hearts. Yes, the originator of "Skibo, Locomotive, "Short Speller are all here. Its about 12 oclock. Excitement is high. More old faces. Younger alumni arc predominating now for the first time this evening. Everybody dancing. Just bumped into Hugh Sprinkle. Excuse me Hugh. Some tired looks. Smiling faces. Everyone still happy. 
The music has been wonderful. In-' tense racket. Lots of football talk at the tables. Musicians look tired. 
The past Campus Queen looks bettern ever. Joe Whitney and Joe Gibson are both here. Bagpipe music. Enter -31ackall and a _ Scotch lassie. Cheers, applause. Being entertained with a graceful Highland fling. Sword dance. Blackall draw a tremendous ovation. Bill  Finkcl all excited but business like.1 Few leaving. Waiters are tired. Everyone who exists goes out shouting a 
big Yea, Carnegie!Party coming to a. close._ Lots of smiling faces and handshaking in the lobby. More noise, from the lobby. Yea, Carnegie! Lets go! Cant wait till next years party. Whoopee!A1 Minetti.
had intervened, with Campus and 
Tech as it used to be, in the be
ginning, flashing anew on memorys silver screen. (This seems to be waxing poctic or pathetic, but never mind!) Annie Howl as the Irishman said, we talked of old times and old stories, of both in and out of the class room: Thosecultural lectures in Room 104, the "Muddy* Trail along the site of the Women's College to be; and. ot" coursc, that first' football game with Pitt in 1906 . . . only it was WUP thenWestern University of Pennsylvania; before the days of "Pitt.
After 20 years I met Carnegies first football captain again . . . Fred Foster, who had come all the way from Los Angeles, part by airplane. He and his wife and sister spent much of Sunday afternoon at our home. And then we saw that WPU game all over again.' I had forgotten the score, but Fred had not; it was 6-0 in WPUs favor. And Fostermore of a giant than ever with the passing of the years, and manager now of a giant oil company of the far westhad sat with 45,000 other football fans and seen the tables precisely turned-?6-0 in - favor of "Carnegie!
Only a few hours before the game wc had a whole carload (literally) of. these same Naughty Eightcrs delivered at our house, to .stay for lunch before going on to the stadium, and when they left they left with .us (us meaning me and Mrs. Follows) that one particular alumnus, with his wife, who, early in 1910, Avon imperishable fame by presenting to the world the first-born of Carsibly to triple it. With over five 
thousand alumni on our list we 
can certainly/[raise a sum which 
will be a conspicious contribution. 
The student's are-going'to join us 
in the movement this year in a 
very active manner. - Last year 
quite a number of them contributed 
but no intensive campaign was put 
on. However, this year the Student Council is "'going to present the matter to the students and it is probable that on November 27 wc will have a lag day, at which time' the students will be asked to contribute what they can af
ford to the Fund.We are always telling you about the two-for-onc plan for the Endowment Fund, but just in case there are some who do not understand we will explain the proposition again: The C.arncgie Corporation has made an agreement with tlie Carnegie Institute of Technology that if wc raise four million dollars for endowment by July, 1946, the Corporation would double the' amount, giving us eight million dollars, which would make a total endow'ment of twelve million dollars for Carnegie Tech. Since that time they liav.e been generous enough to state that they will double the amount of principal and interest, so that the sooner the money is .raised and put out at interest the more it means. for Carnegie Tech.Send your contribution in to the Alumni Office at once!
How Gold
Prospector 
"Went Scotch
Minneapolis, Minn.April 30, 1928Larus & Bro. Co.Richmond, Va.Dear Sirs:
Two years ago last winter I went into the Red Lake gold fields in Canada. It was a tough trail from Hudson, over 140 miles of snow and ice. There were fourteen of us on the trail going in, and frequently at night when seated around a big camp fire, some one would ask me for a pipeful of Edgeworth... These Canadian boys sure like our Edgeworth.
. In four weeks time I ran out of Edgeworth. I was glad to get most any old tobacco.
One day, however, I dropped in to Dad Browns tent, a 72-year-old pros.pector, and seeing a can of Edgeworth on an improvised table, back there 150 miles from the steel, I perked up at once, saying, Dad, Im plum out of tobaccohows chances for a piper ful? Help yourself, he said. So pulling my heavy duty pipe from my pocket, I loaded it with Edgeworth, packing it in so tightly that I couldnt get the least bit of a draw.
I excused myself for a moment, and stepped outside to remove about three pipefuls to put in my pouch. Dad  stepped out, saying, Youre worse than any Scotchman I ever saw. Then I confessed. X told him what happened to my Edgeworththat I was just dying for a smoke, and he understood right away. Ho said, Boy, Edgeworth is.mighty scarce in these parts, but I reckon I can spare whats left of that can. Help yourself. 
You can just bet your last nickel that I guarded this Edgeworth with extreme care until I got back to the  steel.!Yours very truly,
C. M. Baht

whothe son I meanhas made 
another record as the first son of 
a Son of Carnegie to enroll as a 
student at Carnegie. Is he there
fore a "Grandson of Carnegie I 
wonder?
I seem, as I write, to be get
ting rather involved here, but I think you will get the idea; and, after all, that is what I am really aiming at. I am not trying to tabulate a lot of cold facts; in fact, whatever else this is, it is riot a technical article.To say that it was delightful and inspiring to meet all these returned sons of Carnegie falls far short of saying very much of it. What we are all hoping is that next year and for many years to conic'these same men will make the same pilgrimage for the Homecoming, and that those who were not able to come this year will be with us iti 1929.The week-end brought many vivid reminders of those classes of Techs opening dayOctober i6, 1905. On Sunday, the first "Thistle (1906) was taken down from a dusty shelf . . . its pages turned: one result of this was that ' I wrote quite a long, and also overdue, letter to the first Dean of the Margaret Morrison School . . . Nan Smith that was, Mrs. Harry Hart that is. of a ranch with a queer "brand in Melville, Mont. So you see how one thing leads to. another; and I have no doubt that Mrs. Hart, whose ranch is 60 miles or so from the nearest 
railway, will be glad to know how successful the first Honiccoming week-end has been.,

ALUMNI DONATES BRASS PLATES
First Graduating Class was in 1908 I
First Meeting of the 
C. M. E. S. Held Oct. 12
To some of we niglrt students 
a question has arisen in our minds concerning the representationor meaning of the five square brass 
plates laid in the floor at the entrance of. the Industries Building. Well, some of us know that Tech was founded in 1905 and in those days, courses were of threeyears in length and thus the middle square brags plate (Charter Class 1908) represents the first graduating class of Carnegie Tech. The other four brass plates, years 1913, 
1918, 1923 and1928, representsgraduating classes, every fifth year from the Charter Class of 1908. These were an honorary donation to , Carnegie by the Alumni.
O yes, you dont want to grip 
the idea that a "Forest of Arden" is being planted on the campus. Thcrd arc in the neighborhood of 
oak and sycamore trees that have been planted by the school for the purpose of increasing the beauty and scenic value of C I. T.

Aviator Drake Makes Interesting 
Talk at Gathering.
Room 104, Industries,' was the 
scene of a lively meeting pi the 
Nile Mechanicals 911 October 12. 
Bob Drake, one of the contestants 
in the recent cross-country air 
derby, gave a thrilling account of 
his adventures in the air. He also 
participated in the air meet at Los 
Angeles as well as the racc from 
Lbs Angeles to Cincinnati. Those 
of us that have never been up be
came so interested that we almost 
let our enthusiasm get the best of 
us and would have been willing to 
take the bold step right then and 
thereproviding, of course, Mr. 
Drake would have, acted as pilot. 
Questions in connection with avia
tion were answered in a most sat
isfactory manner even though they 
did conic thick and fast. We arc 
sorry that more students did not hear this interesting talk of this modern knight of the air.After the talk and discussion came the refreshments in the form of pretzels, cider, chewing gum as well as the smokes. Perhaps the cider felt out of place with pretzels but given sufficient time these two commodities should soon become boon companions and it certainly Will be a new love for the pret
zels.The C. M. E. S. is seeking.new members. Many inducements arc offered to have the men join. The outstanding features being the small amount of dues$1.00 per year. This includes copies of the A. S. M. E. News as well, as the opportunity to subscribe to the Mechanical Engihe'ering Magazine at the rcduccd rate of $2.50 per year! All members arc entitled to free, service -at the A. S. M. E. Employment Bureau and the use of the technical library. Those interested^ arc re? quested to see either H. W. Sippcl of E. D. Smith. If these men arc not available, you may get in touch with .Prof. Trinks, Machinery Hall.The next meeting, is planned for Tuesday evening, No.ycmbcr 13, and all members who do not class arc urgedto attend. Air effort to have the meetings held 011 the various nights of .the week during the coining ,yc;ir is being expended in order to acc'ommodatc as many of the men asr.impossible to do' so. In .addition to . the meetings at Car
negie, several joint sessions with the A.. S. M. E. at. the William Penn Hotel arc held each year. These affairs give the members an opportunity to associate with most of I he successful engineers in Pittsburgh and surrounding, territory. This alone should be an inducc.mcnt for any one in the mechanical line to join.
Well, we arc still in the running for the championship of the East and heres hoping that the boys can keep up the good work. If the team succceds in going through this year's schedule undefeated, we can sec no reason why they should not be given the title, since their, games arc all of the first class variety and there doesnt seem to be an easy spot in the whole outiit. Sec where our opponent for this week pulled a surprise over the Army. Apparently those two early season defeats did not mean anything as far as weakening the morale of the team is concerned. Now that Notre Dame has reached its stride they will no doubt be out to avenge the surprise that Carnegie (pullcd on them two years ago. Be't Knutc doesnt go to sec any other game this time.
Noticcd in the last issue that the Puppct/ is to _ include the  night students in their affairs. This, certainly is good news'1 after the incident that happened a few years ago. At that time those in chargc were very haughty as far as wc were concerned. They seemed to be under the impression that alt we should do was to buy the paper and be darned glad that wc were even allowed to do so. As may be expected this did not make much of a hit with the fellows and from the reports obtainable the circulation 011 the Night Campus was very small. Well, now that both sides have agree} to bury the hatchet, wc on our side should do all that we can to help the Pup along. So here is hoping that the night circulation will improve.
It wont be long now urf'til the first N. S. C. dance will be held in the Union. This is .primarily a nightstudents affair and is held the night after Thanksgiving; Only a nominal fee is charged in order to give everyone,an opportunity to attend and wc certainly should make an effort to attend.

Annually a day is set aside on the Campus when everybody is given the opportunity to contribute towards this project. This day is set for November 27th, and wc hope, coffcrs will be filled to ,overilowing.The night group is not going to be outdone and wc arc soliciting that you give your bit, 110 matter how small.

.SUCCESS
Succcss is, very largely a matter of choice with each one of us as an individual. Those who succeed are those who choose to succeed. In the majority of cases, those who fail are those who follow tlie path of least resistance, rather than put forth efforts lo sitccced.The matter that scuccss.is large13* a matter of choice is very encouraging indeed. It gives us cour-. age to launch an enterprise with confidence. This is necessary for fear of failure is the sure forerunner of defeat. If we work toward a definite goal, there will be little question of^ our success.
Then again, we must remember it is not commendable to begin an undertaking with a view of 
abandoningJt if it develops unfavorably. We should work at things that, are worth while and' things that are destined to be' carried on to completion. Then, if failure comes, we must face the situation as best we can.

j Idle Thoughts of an Idle Night Student
AERONAUTICAL ENGI
NEERING DEPARTMENT
a few'of the, day students are there and they have always given these affairs crcdit for being done up in a fine manner. Now they arc supposed to be right up to the minute 
on such things and if they meet their approval why dont you night students come ouL and see for yourself how tlie thing is put over. So lets call up the only girl right now and tell her not to forget the 30th. Its 011 a Friday evening. Dont forget.Incidentally, we notice that some are not parking their cars with the rear ends perpendicular to the curb. When you dont dothis, you arc taking up more room than you should and making some one else walk over from Schenley Park. 
Now, you ,would not want to walk this far, so why make some one else do it? How about it? Why not consider the other fellows?Heard a rumor that the Arts Ball would be revived again this year. Hope.this is .true, as it was at one time the most impbrtant affair 011 the Campus. Also hear the Night Arts' are to be represented, which is also gratifying to behold. Hope everyone has a good time and that this time there will be 110 cause to. complain as has been the case with some of the past affairs. Speaking of,the Arts Ball brings up the question of Campus Week. Of course, it seems rather early to mention this affair, but in view of the decision of las! year, it seems that sufficient time should be allowed, for a real oldfashioned discussion 011 this subject. To my mind the Mardi Gras was one of the best get-together affairs ever sponsored by Carnegie and it was with keen regret that quite a lew of the night students saw the passing of this affair. It was in fact about the only activity of C. W. that the fellows could attend, and usually as many as could get tickets would be out. Wonder what the day students think' of the abolition of the Mardi Gras? K.

You know that they arc going to win. They know you know they are going to win and backed by 1 you, they will, win.Your interest, your pep? Aren't you interested in the affairs of your school?

INSTITUTE EXHIBIT MECCA
FOR ART CRITICS
(Continued from Page 1)The college students who attend either assume an attitude of blase critics coming for aesthetic recreation or that of those looking for prototypes of burlesque queens. They, too, criticise with the quick, sure judgment of those accustomed to the deed, and, without delay, designate, pictures offensive to their eyes as being super-saturated with a combination of hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of one to eight.The exhibit also  draws quite a number of club women, who, after a fifteen-minute visit before an, appointment with the hairdresser, present papers for the regular Tuesday meetings on A Complete Aspect of the. International.Long after the popular prize is awarded, the number of visitors counted, and the Exhibition closed, Rotarians, Chamber of Commerce, and Pittsburgh First columnists will point with pride to it' when Pittsburgh is refdrrcd to as a "low spot of culture. And Pittsburghers will reassure themselves and prepare 
to defend the name of their fair city against Chicagoans or Clevelanders.

Carnegie Professors 
To Attend Meeting
Deans R. M. Ihrig and Professor R. B. Leighous have been chosen 
as the delegates to represent ,Carnegic at the fifteenth annual meeting of the Association of Urban (Universities on November 15 to 17 inclusive at the College of the City of New York. The meetings will include a series of lectures followed by discussion. As one of the chief speakers, Professor Leighous will deliver an address on, The Liaison Officer between the Industrial Organization's and the Night School in which its employees arc enrolled.
The Association of Urban Universities is an organization of many of the colleges and universities of the lars/e cities of this country. Its purpose is to make a study of the problems confronting these institutions. Among its chief researches is that of the size of the city in jnfluencing the development of the students:- The association includes a study of the relationship between the employers and their employees, who are attending night schools.
The Urban Universities held their meeting last year at Carnegie under1 President Baker who was its presiThe annual Military Ball is now 1 a thing of history, and those who attended were loud in their praise ot th<N affair. . The decorations, the refreshments, the installationceremony and orchestra all received their share of compliments.Much attention was centered on the large net of balloons hung from a central point in' the room hd radiating to all sides. There were some seven hundred of these balloons suspended in a spider-web -formation. The balloons were a constant sou/ce ot . enjoyment to-: 
the dancers.At about 12 oclock the installation of honorary officers took 
place. The. major and the captains of the six companies andthe honorary officers marched in after the sounding of' Officers Call and Major Lockwood pre
sented the girls with their commissions.- Alice Harding was made 
Honorary Major and Alice Bright, Jeanette Folmar, Helen Bright,Dorothy Roy, Ann Myers and Catherine Boyd were appointed Honorary Captains. Each captain 
then' pinned a pair of captains bars on shoulder of one of thegirls and the group departed front: the hall through an arch of sabers formed by a double iile of ROTC lieutenants. Shortly after the ceremony the names of the men who are to command ROTC companies tins year were announced, A. W. Miller is to command Company A, Gordon Durr, Company B; W. I. Smith, Company C; A. M. Fisher, Company .D; W. M. Mc
Neill, Company E, and L. John-bon, Company F.One of the features of the ball was .the first appearance of the new uniforms of our ROTC. Olive drab uniforms with a plaid stripe jlcwn the trousers and on the 
sleeves, and shoulder straps will make the Carnegie unit as snappy a looking outfit as can. be foujid. 
The uniforms added immensely to the color of the ball and tend to give the affair a more distinctive atmosphere.Refreshments^ were served to all dancers and the Faculty Club 
room was opened, to thtse who wished to sit out an occasional number.
The patrons and patronesses for the evening were: President Baker, Director and Mrs. Ihrig, Director 
and Mrs. Connelly, Director and Mrs. Jewett, Director Kecble, Director Breed, Dean and Mrs. Tarbell, Dean Green, Mr. and Mrs. Bright and Director and Mrs.,'

APPOINTMENTS ANNOUNCED
(Continued from Page 1)Frank, Grande, Scott, R. W. Johnj son, Benko, Fritchic.
The list of appointments is not j yet complete. ~ Some of those who hold, commissions as Second Lieu-1 tenants will be promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant sonietime within the next two weeks. D. P. 
Young, iu addition to holding the position of Second Lieutenant in Company E, will have the title 
Personnel Adjutant and as such, his duties will be to take charge cf the ROTC roll on Thursday drill periods.
The men in the ROTC who hold commissions are seniors chosen for' abilit3r along military lines, and also for their ability to handle men, an accomplishment which is 
emphasized in the ROTC because cf the belief of the officers that 
success depends on the ability to direct and supervise other men, both in civil and military life. The training in the ROTC is admittedly designed to develop those qualities in a man which enable him to make a success in later life in other than military work as well as in'the army itself.
There are six companies. Each company will have assigned to it about seven seniors.  All of the lieutenants in each company Will be given aS much opportunity as is possible to command a platoon.

Announces a New Fall Line ofIn the show and slush of Schcnlcy Park Saturday afternoon, Eddie Roche, of the Pittsburgh Athletic Association won the individual cross-country championship of Western Pennsylvania, Geneva College retained its crown as team champions of the same vicinity, and tlie Carnegie Freshman showed remarkable form in scoring 66 points to Geneva's 43.' Westminster College was between Geneva and the Carnegie Freshmen in team standing with 47 points. Carnegie's Varsity team did not run in the meet, being, on a vacation trip to the Georgetown-Carnegie football game, before their season finale with Grove City here next 'Saturday. Max Salkiij, of ,tbe Plaid Varsity, jentered the meet unattached and scored fourth place. /
Although the temperature ,of the atmosphere forced the  thinly-clads to keep moving in order to keep warm, it also prevented them from breaking any records, by stiffening their muscles. The winners time of 29:47.6 was 37.6 seconds slower than the winning time in last years meet, won by Woody Adams of the University of Pittsburgh.Second place, went tp Elmer Myers of Westminster. He was followed by Dwight Piper of Geneva and Max Salkin of Carnegie. Thir
ty-two runners started the race and all finished.The surprise of the meet was the remarkable sho\ving of the Carnegie Freshman team against the older and more  seasoned competition i'll the race. The times for the six mile course chalked up by the Frosh were comparable to the early season varsity times over the same course. . Jesse Price performed best among the Frosh by placing seventh, which position was ahe'ad of six Westminster runners, and six of the Geneva squad. His males who did well were: Lord, eleventh; Captain Re i chard, twelfth,! and Meenan, fifteenth. Carr, Abbott; Koks, Sander, Krebs, Diges and Hilton scored for Carnegie. Although entered in the meet by Coach Halfcrty only for*experience, the first year men showed stuff that speaks, well for Varsity chances next year.Eddie Roche, the only entrant from -the P. A.

OR THE FIRST TIME this year the team 
x'cally clicked and played the ball of which they
are capable, much to the sorrow of George
towns undefeated squad. It was a wonderful 
game, all Carnegies, played on a perfect footUjtK|M| ball day.
||t Yg/A THE LINE PLAYED as never before;
WflMif Roscnzweig was one of the outstanding perV;:/ ' , : i formers of the daj', with his end arounds which
V > j were practically certain to make six or eight
,/ yards. Dreshar was a fighting devil on both
defense and offense. Schmidt, Lovewell and
Highberger were spectacular in their line work, opening up holes 
for Karcis to plunge through, and fighting through the enemy
defense. Pete Flannagan was again outstanding in his scrappy,
spectacular performance until he was taken out with a torn 
ligament. Eyth would alternate with Karcis in slipping through 
and crashing the line while Moorhead would take long sweeping 
jaunts around the ends. No aerial work was used, much to the 
surprise of the Washington eleven. All in all, the opponents 
were absolutely in the dark as what to expect, or where to ex
pect it, at no time being a serious threat to win. The victory 
was convincing and emphatic. The Catholics from Washington 
considered their toughest game past, but were rapidly lowered

IN THE EAST, the Army, Georgetown and Villa Nova

We dont count chickens before they are chickens, but with 
two more victories we can see visions of Tournament of Roses

getting pointed for another successful defense; Needless^.to say 
the Rockne men are laying for the Plaid. No team or. coach 
forgets a crushing defeat with national championship 'honors 
within their grasp.
REPUTATION OR NOT, with no player seriously hurt,

OLD GOLD HRgnJBC 1!
THE NOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC, the school paper of 
the Irish stronghold, says: More and more the game with
Carnegie Tech takes on added significance. One wonders 
whether tradition will crash in dust or whether the game with 
Northwestern three years -ago will be repeated. Tech has the 
finest team in its history and from the way things look now it 
seems that they will be undefeated, at least until they meet 
Notre Dame on Cartier field.
Another important contest on the Eastern grid card for 
last week was the Pittsburgh-Carnegie Tech battle, in which 
the Tartans emerged victors by a 6-0 count. These two tradi
tional rivals always put on a bloody fight, and this years car
nival was no exception. The game simply marks another climb 
upward on the part of Techs march to football supremacy, cqnfidence, or cockiness, as the case may be.* * * * * * *
UPSETTING NO LITTLE DOPE the Rockne proteges 
took over the Arjny eleven to the tune of 12 to 6, which brings 
(:o mind one of Rocknes favorite jokes. According to Knute, 
Notre Dame defeated the Army two years ago because each 
Cadet back flushed when his ^signal'"was called, and the Irish 
were able to nail tha ball carrier every time.
Rockne told Biff Jones^Army coach, about this after the 
game, with the result that last year the West Pointers were so 
carefully trained that when -a signal was called, all four backs 
flushed profusely, thus completely fooling the Irish on the trick 
plays and consequently-giving, the Army the game. That Army 
backfield, then, is (henceforth and forevermore entitled, accord
ing to Knute, to be known as The Four Flushers.
But here we have the Army again falling in defeat'; prob
ably the backs have reverted to their womaAly habit of flushing. * * * * * * *
The grandstands cheer as the back breaks clear;
They rave and they shout, Thats fine;
But scarcely a soul knows who made that hole 
Down there in the muck of the line.* ** *  * * * *
BUT SEVEN THOUSAND FANS saw the two undefeated 
and highly recognized elevens do battle in the Chadwick Park 
Stadium, last Saturday. With ne'er a game of any importance 
in twenty years the populace had seemingly gotten weaned from 
football and the promoters were thrown for a $25,000 loss. 
Tough, but such is business..* * * *  * *
SOME FOUR HUNDRED local rooters hied themselves to 
the gym on Saturday to watch the grid graph do its stuff. 
Rather a long distant kick, but still a somewhat interesting way 
to watch a game at that.
The crowd showed remarkable enthusiasm and pep which 
lasted all night and became evident the next morning when they 
welcomed home the victorious eleven. Lately the rooters, to
gether with pep-meetings. have more than fufilled expectations. 
Several more are slated this week; let's keep up the good worL
THE CURTAIN FALLS, Saturday, on Carnegies cross 
country season. The varsity winds up facing the Grove City 
harriers on the Schenley six-mile grind, while the Frosh meet 
Shadyside on their course.
With all interest centered on football, we must not forget 
the enviable records, both' the varsity and Pr'ebes are making 
for themselves. Every race has ended a win and from all indi
cations it looks as if both squads will establish no defeat records 
after Saturday.* * * * * *

A FLOCK OF RUNNERS streamed through Schenley last

race. Some thirty-two harriers aced the starting tape, including 
three college teams and numerous men seeking individual hon

Freshmen, took' over the seventh and eleventh places, respedtively. The Freshman team score rated them third place.

Campus improvements continue. 
New roadways, concrete walks, shrubbery and trees continue to appear from time to time as the plans of the administration for a campus beautiful materialize. The most recent noticcable improvement is perhaps the addition of more trees to form the double line along our famous Cut, which was only last year placed in a navigable condition for winter traffic.The new trees arc of the same variety that are found elsewhere on the campusplanus oricntalus. Experience has shown that this pecies is the most suitable for municipal park development, being affected only slightly by smoke, fumes, continual pruning and the climate peculiar to this district. It is of interest, incidentally, to know that this feature of our landscaping Along the cut is due largely to the activity of the Carnegie chapter of Mortarboard, the women's senior honorary, and it is with true appreciation of their efforts that the region along the Cut is familiarly becoming known as "Mortarboards Woods."
WHY FIGHT?
Weeks ago an editorial was published in llie Tartan presenting this papers viewpoint on the Canir pus Week situation. It was stated that it was believed the student body wanted the traditional spring vacation as it had been in former years. Apparently that supposition was in error. Certainly there has been very little consideration of the matter outside of a few individuals who felt as did The Tartan. No reaction of any kind has been apparent on the part of the the general student body, who would naturally be most concerned with a Campus Week celebration. 
The results have been anything but encouraging for those few who believed that to discontinue such a tradition would be a violation of student interests. It was felt with all sincerity that a well-ordered and properly handled Campus Week celebration would be a distinct asset to the_ social life of the Carnegie community, and it is still believed by many persons that a very fine Majr recess could be carried on with signal success. But whats the use?Whether Carnegie students are fundamentally different from the average normal person of college age, whether the nature of their work is such as to make social activity undesirable, or whether they are just naturally passive seems to be a current question. In any case, it would certainly be undesirable to thrust upon them any function or activity in which they are not interested, and at present there is sufficient evidence to cause  the belief that Carnegie students as a body do not want Campus Week. Why should campus organizations go out of their way to try to maintain traditions that one might easily be led to think arc not favorably consicfered by the majority of students?In view of these facts, The Tartan is again requesting an informal referendum on the matter. What do the students want? If the many campus organizations will only make some indication of the general trend, either individually or in groups, much can be accomplished cithcn one way or the other. If Senate representatives, class officers. Student Council members, will be informed of -the wishes of their constituencies, it would not be difficult to determine the attitude of the student body. If clubs, fraternities, classes, would only make some expression of the
PROBABLE SCENE AT FRESHMAN SHUFFLE
Theyve elected a new president. The official three cheers and payas-you-get-them-so-they-will-be-sure to reach you telegrams have been delivered. Herbert Hoover continues to nestle in the confines of a three-inch starched collar and "alls right with the world. From this groundhogs hole, we can see little of the new "higher-up. Starting at his trouser-cuff, and going up, he looks all right that way. Spanning 
his merry width, he again passes approval.This undcrgrad is not old enough to vote. Sometimes it wonders, "Who will be president? but it can find no answer to its riddles. Once it looked for an answer to its riddle behind the parlor sofa and it founddust, its shadow, and what was due to belong inside the sofa all the timestuffing. Sometimes it wonders Supposing it were old eonugh to vote, w^ would it vote for? Then it thinks, Supposing it were old enough to vote and knew who it would vote for, would its parents pay its taxes? Then it gives up. The president is as good as elected. He, Hoover, is an all-right guy. It will give its support to 
"Hoiby. Hoiby was elected on the fifty-second heart-beat. That is, rL e., e. eg., for example, the fifty-second heart-beat from the first (Ipsi dixit.) Which, as my father says when he isnt feeling well, is all in how you look at it (N. B.My father aint feelin well these days, 
only every Friday, when he cant get at mamas pocketbook to get money to buy pop. It dont like pop as well as father; it s young, give 
it a chance.)We'll start all over. Herbert is president. Alfred is defeated. Thomas is also fortunate. It was once president of a mud-pie club. The one that ran the slowest got to be president because votes was xn mud-pics and it had all the evidence of presidency about it. It can t remember which was worse, getting elected or the inawgerration. _ It sorta thinks Hoover better conserve on his strength before he gives way under the offal strain. It had an awful time that day, And later. 
Anyhow. .....It watched some people vote that day. Dummies, instead of signing their names right, they had to marks Xs. Thats all right, nobuddy is going to tell what you did. Nobody cares. The way everybody but us stuffed the ballot box was a shame. Long live Carnegie.Which we dont want you to think it is ignorant. But honest, it dont know what to think about the new president. Or anything.* * * * *
And why not? objects our compeer with whom we have been discussing the ever-vital question of "College in the Movies."Why so? we retaliate. "Why should everyone including the college student himself get het up about college movies? Of course, theyre not true to life 1 Why should they be?Why shouldnt they be he storms back. Did you ever have to live down an impression YOUR parents got of college from the movies they attended while you were away at school? Why my people would think I was crazy if I told them I stayed up all night to study only to flunk a Math quiz the next day! They picture their pride-and-joy-inswaddling-clothcs of twenty years ago fitting around the city tripping the professors and using girls hearts as foot-balm. Why, when I come home they have that God-forbid-whats-going-to-happen-to-us-next 
look about theml All from a bunch of pictures like The Campus Flirt and The Fair Coedl Theyd never, by an accident in this wide world, get to know the humiliation we go through when we wear our R. O. T. C. pants wrong, or get bawled out in the Physics lab. If their agony over me was half so great as mine when I find out that the girl I have installed in the dream home of imagination chews gum and yells in a crowd, I'd like to tell that whole crew ^Hollywood to make nothing but Passion plays the rest of their lives 1But, we objected. You go to the movies to be amused, to see things which you cannot see every day. You wouldnt want to see a picture true to the college life, you know. You yourself confess to its being boring. If the Movies give you college-as you want it, why object? You know theyre not true to life, and so does everyone else. If your parents are under the delusion that what they see is what is true, let them think so. It wont be_hard for them to realize that they must not always believe their eyes in college more than in any other pictures. Furthermore, to believe that the two of them had produced a son so strange as you would hardly be a credit to the_ knowledge they have of each other. For if the law of heredity works in this case as well as it does in others, they will soon realize that they are your parents, and that you must be all right after all.He was not convinced. And, in spite of the^fact that he prides himself on his opinions, we dont blame him.* * * ? *

feeling among their members, con
cerning school affairs, a much more 
intelligent campaign may be con
ducted, whether jt be for Campus 
Week, Senior Week or under-class 
fights. The Tartan again offers to serve as a clearing house for undergraduate opinion. Letters, the results of votes, or other campaign literature of any kind will be welcomed and will receive proper publicity. In fact, it is only the indifferent silence of Carnegie students that is disheartening. If Carnegie is to have a Campus Week, it will be necessary for more favorable comment; to be made. Otherwise, why fight?
Jingling in the Wind. By Elizabeth Madox Roberts. New York: The Viking Press. 1928. 256 pp.
Those who favor the ultra-modernist movement will find Jingling in the Wind amusing. Written in the stream-of-consciousness manner, the thought processes of animate and inanimate objects are enumerated with subtlety. The result is generally interesting, but often dull and sometimes obscure.Obviously a satire on our modern civilization, all manner of personages and events are conglomerated in a most peculiar pattern. Sympathetic readers will discern a novel treated as a sympathy of ideasthe declaration of a theme, the numerous minor leit-motifs, and their shrewd recurrence at unexpected points. The author has taken gentle but well-pointed thrusts at many of our popular fetishes. Our craze for cults, heroworship, Freud, eugenics, mechanical development and monkey glands are subjected to treatment bordering on the burlesque.
Mr. Stuart Chases criticism of advertising our author has summed up in a paragraph. The electric signs flaming in the night are compared to the constellations of the heavens:"A great cavern toward the south had burst into light with a hortative saying, Use Jetts Laxative. Try the Castor Kiss. Then over the Milky Way ran an authoritative command bearing the force of all astronomical things, saying, Eat Beans, Eat Beans Now. Out of Cassiopeia herself sprang a patterned reminder in red and pink lights, and next spoke Virgo, the Virgin, behind a shield of lights, For Poise and Maiden 
Beauty Use Shamrock Soaps, Shampoos. Shamrock. Scorpio then named a baking powder with praise, and Leo spoke sweetly of lovely teeth, shining and white, and warned in sinister growls of lurking disease under the gums. Serpens returned them with information of Jetts Laxative, saying much briefly in praise of Dr. Jett's 
or he warned darkly of a new
disease. All night the constella
tions conversed together.
The consort of an Oriental po
tentate passes shrewd comment on 
our idle rich. She observes that 
they arc hindered but little by the 
need for prayer. ... A woman 
there will punish her c,nemics by 
wearing before their eyes a cost
lier jewel than the enemies can 
wear. When the festival season 
comes near an end at the close of 
the winter, these women fly to the 
fashionable doctors to. have''cured 
their diseases brought on by Hate 
and worry. ... I aw a woman

she had planned for her enemies

COLGATE UNIVERSITY
(By Intercollegiate Press and 
Syracuse Daily Orange)A. college 
professor has distinguished himself 
by finding a use for the cribber.
Unknown to themselves, 30 successful cheaters at Colgate University were studied by Professor H. C.- Brownell, and used, as laboratory specimens, showing the mental and emotional traits of college men who cheat _ at examinationsand get away with it.
Information about the 30 was obtained by underground and unofficial channels, Professor Brownell states in reporting his investigation. None of the cheaters was caught even by a severe proctoring system.Eighty per cent of the group were found to be more psychroneurotic, or emotionally unstable that the campus average. More than half fell below the college average in intelligence, and the majority belonged to the type known as psychological extrovertsthat is, good social _ mixers and more inclined to activity than thinking.Contrasted with the student body the cribber becomes a psychological type,  Professor _ Brownell concludes: His low intelligence maymake cheating somewhat of a necessity. His extroversion may operate to further this. His emotional instability makes it easier for the spirit to succumb under the two-fold necessity.More than half the college cheating would be eliminated if this psychological type could be eliminated, according to Professor Brownell. With the general type would go most of the all-around college men who shine in team and track contests, glee clubs, dramatic productions, and other bookless college activities, the professor believes.

WHO READS EDITORIALS?
That the average college student 
reads exclusively the front page 
headlines  and the sports columns 
of a newspaper, are contentions which have been repeatedly made and, from observation, repeatedly confirmed. That this condition is sn indication, or rather accounts for, an intellectual stagnation is 
likewise evident. Truly, there must be some accounting for 'this lethargy.Whether th immaturity of the average student, the super im
portance of athletics, both collegiate and non-collegiate, or the failure of academic leaders is the source of this apathetic and deplorable state of affairs, we can not say. Rather, it is the sum of all these vigorous activitiesa sorry contrast to the more even, balanced European University system with the proportionate * emphasis on things socially ; intellectual. ' The coffee house of continental universities is almost a symbol of scholastic youth itselfa social, even hectic, student life that thrills to the issues of the individual and the world.In those coffee houses, resounding with the chatter and harangue of the inquisitive youth, the editorialist would find his dream fulfilled. Here the college newspaper opened to its editorial page would provide sufficient fuel lor conver
sation and discussion. Here would be even the birthplace of responses to editorials. Here wouldbe the final great infiltration of suggestive drops spread from theeditorial pen. Here might any editorial writer, certainly any serious individual, bask in the intelligence of conscious youth.Alas, we are forced to resign ourselves to an editorial public representing only a small faction of those receiving the paper. But this acceptance is not accompanied by too deep a local regret for the same situation prevails throughout 
American Collegiana. No doubt it is the combination of all the distortional excesses and no doubt, these in turn are the result of America _ not yet having come of age.
When the college student will gobble up the' news in conjunction with the side glare from the editorial column, then indeed will 
the editorial millennium be reached. You reader, have already reached it.New York Oniversjty.
The AnxiouslyAwaited Visitor
Old Mrs. Briggs leans forth in her rocker, parts the curtains and anxiously peers up and down the street. It is_ very evident that she is in the grip of some very great emotioiufor the muscles of her face twitch continuously and she is drumming on the arm of the wellworn rocker in which she js sitting. A highly expectant note is easily discernible in her kindly face as she looks around the room with its clean threadbare rugs, spotless floors and gleaming heating stove. The note of simplicity and cleanliness pervades the entire cottage for you can catch glimpse^ of the other rooms tnrough the doorways.
Her kindly face breaks into a faint smile as she looks at an old picture that is hung in a bedroom adjoining the room she is in. The picture js of a small bojr. His black hair is in ringlets about his cherubic face and his smile shows bewitch
ing dimples in her cheeks. His robust body is astride a rocking horse with his stocky legs pushed into miniature stirrups. When the features of _ the little chap are studied, he is easily recognized as the son of the lady who waits at the window.Taking a sheet of yellow paper from the pocket of her faded apron she carefully reads it and looks intently at the clock on the mantel. If it was possible to photograph her thoughts we would have a most interesting picture, for she is again smiling and a note of relief is spoken in her^sigh for a handsome young man is walking up the avenue. After all her years of hard work and toil, anxious years of worry, and heartbreaking disappointments in both social and financial matters, she will have her reward at last. Now she may have a costly automobile, sumptuous home, fair-weather friends and social esteem, for her own little son has grown to a stalwart man who has 
recently become a football star at his large university. Now these things will be hers for he has indorsed Old Gold Cigarettes, Paris Garters, Schoble Hats, Weis Athletic Underwear, Fleischmanns Yeast, and huge movie and vaudeville contracts are in the immediate future.
The second of the informal program to be held at Pittsburgh Musical Institute on Tuesday evening is announced for this week, November 15. The pianist will be Kathryn Brose, the violinist Joseph Ternyey, and the speaker Charles N. Boyd.

MUSICAL CRITICISM By Joe B. Patterson
BAUER-GABRILOWSKIRECITALLast Friday night w6 heard the world s greatest two-piano artists, Harold Bauer and Ossip Grabiloski. Superlative artists, in fact; These two artists were here last season, so it was but natural that a large audience should be present to hear the finest exponents of duo art known to the concert stage. These two men gave -a program that was highly personal and most impersonal.
For ensemble, unity, entity, perfection of phrase, tonal development, tonal diminishment, figurated minuteae, nothing more compelling has been heard here than the Shuman B flat variations. This was done in a very masterful-style.Opening with the familiar "Fantasia ^ and Fugue in A minor of Bachs, we heard a fugue flavored and colored to a very high degree. It was a very fine fugal exposition, but with it all there was a quality of playing such as we dont often hear. Mozarts B major sonata was notable, for its _ andante cantabile. It was lovely in tempo with an allergo that sparkled and an adagio that was perfectly poised.1 he three Schubert numbers were stunning works, having come from the transcriptional pen of Harold Bauer. Indeed he did a masterful job of it. The fantasia had amazing figures and answers, the Theme Varie,* was an excellent piece of instrumental juggling, while the rondo had edge and delicacy.
Then came the Arnesky waltz and they played it superbly. SaintSans scherzo, (played here last year and the season before that) closed the program in a stirring fashion. This is the only twopiano recital for this year, but we wish we could hear them play once again.
We have been rather under the 
weather lately with a nasty cough, 
so perhaps there arc a few things 
that have escaped our notice, in 
spite of the reputation we hold 
for having remarkable powers of 
observation. What with Halloween 
and elections and all its hard to 
see everj'thing! Besides, every once 
a while wc get rather bored 
with looking around, and we think 
how much nicer it is just to re
flect We admit, of course, that no 
one has ever accused us of being a very profound philosopher. Anyway, we ask your indulgence,
Being a very impecunious person, we regret the out-of-town &ames our team plays. Football games mean loads of fun and very much cheaper Saturday afternoon entertanments than the theater. They are, perhaps, not always so edifying as the drama, but, nevertheless, a very enjoyable pastime. Now that the Notre Dame bugbear is upon'us, let us all keep our fingers crossed and pray hard. Were not asking for a miracle, only for a repetition of what happened two years ago. Is such a repetition possible? .Well, we shall see what we shall see!
Its hard to think of plebe regulations being over in about a month. Not that we .think the plebs got off easily this year, by any means. We havent seen much stricter enforcement of rules or harder penaltes.for disobedience in a long time. As long as there must be freshman regulations, this new system is what we need. Its much better to have just a few months of regulations and really have them, than it is to spread the regulations over two semesters with no visible observance of rules.' Wc hope that the success of the plan this year will be sufficipnt to guarantee its continuation.
There may be several million people who were pleased with the outcome of the election, but we think we got a raw deal. What we want 
to know is why Will Rogers name wasnt evgn put on the ballot. Not that were old enough to -vote, but think of all the /hot air weve wasted. For months we've been campaigning for the illustrious' Mayor of Beverley Hills, and 'then they go^and pull a trick like that on us! '^In spite of ballots^ and electoral votes, we still maintain that what this country needs is ojficials with a sense of humor, ancl-r.you cant tell us that Mr. Rodgers isnt a better fisherman than his brother Californian.
LABORATORY EDUCATION
Autumn ushers in two other seasons, namely the football season and the super-critical season par excellence. The latter not only lasjs, longer than the other, but is 
perhaps the most exhilarating . . . from one point of view. It is the 
whats-wrong-with-the-colleges season opening usually with the September issue of so-called high-tone magazines, and lasting until Commencement Day. Present, indica
tions point to a most fruitful season. Witness an article written by a former college professor, a man who spent 10 years in one of our leading educational institutions, attempting to teach college students, 99 per cent of whom, as can be inferred, were not very intelligent!
The author hurls two main chargcs_ against the present system, one being that the curriculum reFrom TheFence j
Wasnt The Jealous Moon perfectly charming? Were childish enough yet to enjoy harlequinades and dream plays, and we dont even attempt to deny the fact 'Yes, we still maintain that Beggar On Horseback is one of the best. Anyway, Jane Cowl is divine! The last time we saw her was about five or six years ago in Romeo and Juliet, but shes still as lovely as ever. She seems to have been made for balcony scenes. Wc arent, of course, trying to compare her and her co-author with Shakespeare, but the Second act of this new play of theirs wasnt1; so bad. And its the first scene of this kind that weve seen in years where the fair damsel's head wasnt cut off from view. You sec we arent in the habit of occupying an aisle seat in orchestra circle.
THINK IT OVER
In the smaller countries of Latin 
America, writes an American pub
licist, controlled by our soldiers, 
our bankers, and our oil kings, we 
are developing our Irelands, our 
*Egypts and our Indias. The Latin-American policy of the United 
States"dollar diplomacy, with its 
combination of bonds and battle
shipsis cccentially imperialist, so 
he believes, and means the destruc
tion of our nation just as surely as 
as it meant the destruction of Egypt and Rome and Spain and Germany and all the other nations who came to measure their greatness by their material possessions rather than by their passion for justice and by the number of their friendly neighbors.Contrast this with the ringing words of Charles Evans Hughes, then Seci'ctary of State,_ in his Bar Association Address in August, 1923:We are aiming not to exploit, but to aid; not to subvert, but to help in laying the foundations for sound, stable, and independent government 
Our interest does not lie in controlling foreign peoples; that would be a policy jDf mischief and disaster. Our interest is iln having prosperous, peaceful, and lawf-abiding neighbors, with whom we can co-operate to mutual advantage.In other words, the United States is anything but imperialistic. Roundly Secretary Hughes condemned, in another address (at Amherst, June 18, 1924), those writers who apparently make it their business to develop antagonism and to spread among the people of this country, who have no opportunities for judgment from personal knowledge, the notion that our. policies are imperialistic, that our influence is baleful, and that mutual respect and friendship are decreasing.Whether the United .States is, or is not, pursuing a policy of imperialism *in relation to Latin America, the facts set forth should enable the reader to decide for himself if he cares to do so. Infinitely more important than selecting labels and bandying names, is .the clear-sierhted perception of the realities. Whether we call America imperialist matters not at all, but it matters much whether we understand exactly what America has done, and is doing. Such understanding is the more difficult, because no man can' be wholly objective . in appraising the activities of his own country; either he is blinded by the optimistic variety of patriotism, which can see no dvil, hear no evil, speak no evil; or else with the righteous wrath of the prophet, whether through patriotism or pacifism, he finds nothing to praise, everything to blahib. To be conscious of this psychological predisposition to prejudice, is perhaps easier than to free ones mind from it.
American Dollar Diplomacy and financial control, backed up by occasional naval demonstrations or by^ the landing of marines, is not a unique method of controlling disorderly or insolvent countries. On the contrary, franc diplomacy and pound sterling diplomacy, as the reader will doubtless remember, were conspicuous in Morocco, Tunis, and Egypt as was ruble diplomacy in Persia, mark diplomacy in Turkey, and yen ^diplomacy in
quircmcnts arc too extensive fn scopc, the other, the prevalent assumption that all fields of human 
knowledge are of equal merit. Thi first step in the reform is to abolish the fetish of the college degree which at best is merely the trademark-of a protected industry. It represents a meaningless > mas^ of work done to attain standardization 
suchas trademarks imply, in his opinion. One fails to see how the mere abolishment of the degree would bring about the desired results. The fact that houses of correction and penitentiaries grant no degree does not in the least change or improve the training given therein. A college degree signifies the accomplishment and successful complction of certain requirements no more, no less; and is silent as regards the quantity or quality of the courses , so completed.The relative values of various subjects are_ then . discussed by the author. He is searching for courses which his one per cent group of highly intelligent young men (the rest dismissed as not very intelligent) would find most suitable in being fitted for the companionship of educated men, after having cheerfully thrown overboard their degree. Languages and mathematics with certain reservations are acceptable. Economics and government are dismissed as unscientific ... . . veritable pseudo-sciences; here a whole years work can be compressed into a few hours of private reading. These few pleasantries can be overlooked magnanimously, but his estimate of psychology leaves one cold. He simply loathes it, for in his own words no other subject is today so dominated by uncontrolled enthusiasm, fanaticism, ignorant and absurd pretentions as psychology. ' One must conclude that the writer is totally, unacquainted with Scholastic Psychology or makes reference to the popular psychology of the day, with Jung and Freud ?s vanguards to the* psychoanalysts and others of that ilk. Consequently one can readily agree with this complaint on present-day methods which profess to have found a cure for all imperfections of nature. Real scientific methods of research have been discarded to serve the end of certain individuals whose pet theories have brought discredit to the queen of all sciences.The author has a solution for the whole problem. It_ is the study of more laboratory sciences. With the exception of  math and lan
guages, the only courses of whose worth he is certain arc such sciences. _ 1-Ie would reject all other studies. _ This of course is nothing new, it is the (perennial call to worship at the shrine of science.To say that science offers no such royal road to lcarningf is not to disparage it. Its wonders have benefited humanity immensely, but ;t offers no substitute for a liberal education. Specialization is the very antithesis of a liberal education.
If the college curriculum is too broad, restricting it to the study of sciences will be to go from one extreme to the other. The fundamental purpose of a college education is not to equip the student with a specialized training in one branch of learning lone. The student comes to college to have his mind broadened, to secure a liberal education. lie must not be content with mere facts, but must strive to apply his newly acquired knowledge to the problems of his time and age. Science as yet has failed to find an answer to the age-old problems of man and society. Hence the curriculum must be extensive. Science in its relation to education should be regarded as a means rather than the end.
China. Lending money to unsta
ble governments, or investing 
money in unruly countries, has beet 
one of the most widespread features of imperialism, and has usually. in led to annexations, in European practice, whereas in American practice dollar diplomacy leads to financial receiverships, that is to the collection^ of the customs duties of a Haiti or a Santo Domingo by American officials, or. to other methods of financial supervision. It may be pointed out in this connection, that the American method is more subtle, achieving as it does the desired financial and economic domination, without political annexation and often, as in the case of Suba, without much impairing interests with political principles, it has its philosophical as well as its practical attratcions.In congratulating themselves upon their magnanimity in carrying out their pledge to emancipate Cuba, and upon the unselfish character of American policy toward Cuba, enthusiastic Americans often ignore the facts and sometimes indulge in a self-esteem that border* on-hypocrisy. Nevertheless, admitting that Cuba was not set entirely free, and admitting also that there have been profits for private American interests, it may also be pointed out that instead of outright annexation the United States was content with veiled control; instead1 of unbiased exploitation, American 
interests promoted the economic development of the island. Toward Cuba the United States practised not naked imperialism but a more subtle imperialism, which left to the Cuban people a very considerable amount * of sclflgovcrnment and which sought its profits in the economic prosperity and political stability of Cuba. In precisely these respects the lot of Cuba has been incalculably preferable to that 
of Persia, ICore(a, or .Congo.It would have been relatively easy to obtain from Nicaragua the right to dig a canal across Nicaraguan territory, and this route was favored by a cpminission of investigation, but President Roose* vclt an dthe Senate for various technical reasons preferred the route across Panama. Roosevelt obtained from Congress authority to use this route if lie could make the arrangements within a reasonable time and at reasonable ex
pense.The other obstacle, Colombia, seemed to be nicely disposed of when Secretary Hay signed the Hav-Herran Treatv ofJanuary 22, 1903, with the Colombian minister, providing for a ninety-nine year lease (in imitation of the Chinese leases of 1898) of a strip of territory six miles wide, across the isthmus, for a payment of ten million dollars plus an annual rent of a quarter million. Great was the chagrin in Washington when the Colombian Senate, hoping apparently to make better financial .terms, refused to ratify the treaty ahd adjourned on October 31, 1903. Roosevelt decided to go ahead with the canal regardless of Colombia* rights. He drafted a message to Congress, in October, 1903, recommending that the United States should build the canal through Panama even without Colombias consent. In a private letter to Dr. bcrt Shaw, lie wrote on October 10, 1903, I should be delighted if Panama were an independent state; or if it made itself so at this moment; but forme to say so publicly would amount to an instigation of a revolt, and therefore I cannot say it. Tic did not need to say it. Mr. Phillipe Btinau-Varilla and various Panamans, in the United States and in Panama, felt sufficiently confident that their action would not meet with disapproval, to launch a revolution in Panama on November 3, 1903..American marines were forthwith landed, under orders to prevent the landing of Colombian troops within fifty miles ^ of Panama. The right of secession, denied by Lincoln to the Southern States, was redognized by Roosevelt in the Colombian state of Panama.
Why the new republic of Panama was so zealously shielded and immediately recognized by the United States appeared clearly enough when a treaty was signed on November 18, 1903, whereby in consideration of ten million dollars cash and a quarter-million per annum thereafter (beginning in 1911), Panama leased to the United States in perpetuity a canal zone ten miles wide, oVer which the United States would-exercise sovereign rights, including the right of fortification.Thus Roosevelt, in his own words, "took the Canal Zone.
