Tartan Assistant News Editor
Democratic vice presidential candidate A1 Gore 
came to Pittsburgh last Wednesday. Speaking to 
an audience numbering in the thousands at the 
Marketplace at the west end of Forbes Avenue, 
Gore spoke on labor, health care, business, aiid 
the vice-presidential debates, as part of a larger 
Democratic party rally.
Senator Gore spoke to the general public and 
the press immediately after the speech, and spoke 
to college newspapers about Presidential cadidate 
Bill Clintons educational plan.
Gore said that Clintons plans include a tuition 
payment program where college costs are payable 
by community service, either before, during, or 
after college. Therefore, it would be possible for a 
student to pay for his or her education in advance, 
according to Gore.
His wife, Tipper, also spoke to college papers on 
her position regarding societal problems in 
Amorica. Wo need outreach.... I would continue 
to try to bo a voicc for children and for the more 
vulnorablo in our society, she said.

Robert Fishel, a GSIA masters student, was 
found dead at the base of the Panther Hollow 
Bridge on October 12. He was 29.
Pittsburgh paramedics pronounced Fishel dead 
at 4:54 pm that Monday upon their arrival at the 
scene. The Pittsburgh Police coroners office listed 
the cause of death as blunt impact to the head and 
chest area, and ruled it a suicide.
Memorial services were held among GSIA fac
ulty and students on Thursday. The same day 
Fishels funeral was held in Canton, Massachu
setts. Dean of GSIA Robert Sullivan and Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy attended the 
funeral.
Sullivan spoke about Fishels excellent aca
demic record, as well as his personal achieve
ments. Bob was always considered an extra
gifted student, colleague, and role-model. As a 
student, as a friend, and as a colleague, he was 
superb, said Sullivan, who also expressed sin
cere appreciation for the services of what he 
termed the much underrated Counseling Center, 
which quickly and sensitively reacted and saw to 
the needs of GSIA graduate students after Mon
day.
Murphy also spoke positively about Fishels 
active life on campus. Bob was very involved as 
a graduate student.... [He was] very active as a 
photographer, as a member of Theta Xi, and as a 
varsity diver.
Fishel is survived by a wife and a child.

Tom Luce, ex-National Cam
paign chairman for independent 
Presidential candidate Ross Perot 
spoke on campus October 9, where 
he told his audience that Perot 
was the start of a vast populist 
movement in America.
At a lecture sponsored by the 
Heinz School and entitled The
1992 Election and tho Economy: 
A Third Perspective, the 52-yoarold campaign strategist painted 
a picture of a movemont largor 
than a single candidate, composed 
of average Americans con
cerned with the countrys future.
According to Luce, the Perot 
movement tapped into a growing 
wave of diBgust with the political 
system. Ross Perot was a skilled 
surfboard rider who rode the
wave, said Luco. "But ho didnt

GSO pushes for representation
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Staffwriter
At last Tuesdays Student Sen
ate meeting, Lara Wolfson, gradu
ate statistics student and presi
dent of the Graduate Student 
Organization (GSO), proposed 
that GSO be recognized as the 
governing body of the graduate 
students of Carnegie Mellon, to 
be a separate body that works 
alongside, but not subject to, Sen
ate ... This proposal is a result of 
the recent concern over the spe
cific language of Student Senates 
proposed set of new bylaws. Ac
cording to Wolfson, the new by
laws threatens the independence 
of GSO. If these new bylaws are 
passed, GSO will be completely in 
Senates power. They can tell us 
how to do things, control our bud
get  it essentially takes away 
all the influence GSO has.
As stated in the Constitution of 
GSO, one of the purposes of GSO 
is to act as the representative 
body for the graduate students 
and to present their views to the 
administration, faculty, and undergraduates. However, no
where in the Student Senate by
laws is GSO formally recognized 
as the governing body of gradu
ate students. Wolfson says, The 
GSO is a representative body of 
the graduate students in ways 
that Senate and student govern
ment cannot be, and graduate 
students must be recognized as a 
distinct entity on this campus 
with a separate governing body. 
Unless specified otherwise in the 
proposed bylaws, it is assumed 
that those bylaws apply to GSO, 
... and that they would effec
tively prevent GSO from ever 
being anything other than an ap
pendage of Senate, according to 
Peter Ashcroft, a graduate stu
dent in engineering and public 
policy. In the eyes of GSO, Senate 
is basically an undergraduate or
ganization, accordingto Wolfson, 
who says it is unreasonable to 
suspect th^t undergraduates 
should be concerned with gradu
ate problems, because under
graduates have problems, too. So 
why should Student Senate spend 
time on graduate issues? Thats
the purpose of GSO. She adds 
that graduate students do not 
have a dean of graduate studies, 
and GSO is the only voice the 
graduate students have, and it 
is time that student government 
recognize GSO as such. GSO, 
however, is an independent orga
nization that is not funded by 
Student Senate at all. Instead, 
GSO receives 37 percent of the 
$100 Graduate Students Activi
ties Fee, while the remaining 63 
percent goes to Student Senate to 
allocate to student organizations. 
Since GSO is an independent or
ganization, it has the exclusive 
right to budget that 37 percent in 
any way it chooses, and that bud
get is beyond the control of Stu
dent Senate. GSOs concern, 
therefore, is in the specific lan
guage used in the proposed by
laws.
However, Senator Gregory 
Haverkamp (CIT), Rules Com
mittee chair, posted on assocs.gso, 
It is, in my opinion, in GSOs 
best interest to stay as far out of 
the bylaws as possible. Please see GSO, page 7

THIS JUST IN...
Presidential candidates examine health care
WASHINGTON, October 15 (DJ)
 Evaluating the Presidential can
didates proposals to revamp the 
nations health care system is like 
playing with faulty jigsaw puzzles, 
The Wall Street Journal reported.
Neither Bill Clinton nor President 
Bush provides a complete picture of 
health care reform, which is likely to 
be near the top of the agenda in the 
next administration. It bugs me 
when people talk about the two plans, 
says Stanford economist Alain Enthoven, a longtime student of the 
health care system. They dont have 
plans, either one. Each is equivocat
ing.
Independent candidate Ross Perot 
has even less to say on health care 
than his two opponents do. His book, 
United We Stand, has only two brief 
pages on the subject. One of his solu
tions is: Encouraging problem-solving by everyone involved.
Health care has grown steadily in 
importance as a political issue in the 
past few years; with health care costs 
rising at twice the rate of inflation, it 
iB also becoming an unavoidable eco
nomic issue. Any effort to get control 
of the nations swelling budget deficit 
is doomed, experts say, unless run
away health care costs are reined in.
But while everyone seems to agree 
there is a problem, the solutions di
verge alongideological lines. Conser
vative solutions, such as that put 
forward by the Heritage Foundation
in Washington, work to minimize gov
ernment involvement and use com
petition to drive down costs. Many 
liberals, on the other hand, favor a 
syBtem of national health insurance 
such as that in Canada, or a govern
ment board that would set health 
care prices.
Bush clearly sides with those who 
want to minimize government in
volvement. By encouraging and em
powering people through the tax 
syBtem to buy insurance, and by enactinginaurance market reforms that 
make it possible for everyoneeven 
if they have pre-existing health prob
lems  to get insurance, the plan 
aims to create a health care market 
in which competition keeps costs 
down.
But the Bush plan has some huge 
gaps. For one, it doesnt place a cap on 
the tax deductions businesses are al
lowed for health care expenses. Such 
a cap, according to those who de
signed the Heritage Foundation plan, 
is critical to create incentives to con
trol costs under a Bush-style freemarket plan.
The Becond gap in the Bush plan is 
that it doesnt provide health care 
coverage to everyone. The full $3,750 
tax credit is only available to people 
below the poverty line, and even then, 
experts say, it may not be enough to 
buy adequate care. For middle-income taxpayers who dont have in
surance, the Bush plan offers a$3,750
tax deduction, which is worth only a 
little more than $1,000. The Bush 
administration claims that all but 
about five million of those now 
uninsured would be covered; a bipar
tisan study by Families USA says 27 
million Americans would remain 
without adequate coverage.
The problem with Clintons plan is 
less that it is incomplete than that it 
is incoherent. He has attempted to 
straddle the views of differing ele
ments in the Democratic Party, and 
the result is a plan lacking any clear 
philosophy.
In the Presidential debate on Sun
day, Clinton said he favors managed 
competition. Thats an idea made 
popular by Enthoven, the Stanford 
economist, in which employers would 
let employees choose among stan
dardized health care packages and 
have the employees pay any costs 
over a certain minimum. The idea is 
to set up competition among health 
care plans that would hold down costs.
But Clinton has also embraced glo
bal budgeting, a concept favored by 
many congressional Democrats. Un
der that plan, a national board would 
set an overall health care budget for 
the nation and in certain instances 
also establish fee schedules for vari
ous medical services. That, Enthoven 
says, is inimical to his proposal for 
managed competition.
A national board inescapably 
means price controls on doctors and
hospitals, says Enthoven. But 
medical care is a particularly un
suitable subject for price controls. 
Clinton, he argues, is waffling be
cause he doesnt want to antago
nize one or the other faction of the 
party.
Clintons defenders argue that a 
national board is essential to mak
ing managed competition work. The 
board would define an acceptable 
medical benefits package and set 
the maximum cost; health care pro
viders would then compete to get 
corporate business. The board acts 
as a backstop, explains one Clinton 
aide, but our hope is that managed 
competition will drive costs below 
the budget.
Henry Aaron, an economist at the 
Brookings Institute, says the call for 
a global budget at least indicates 
that Clinton, unlike Bush, is com
mitted to capping health care costs.
Unlike Bushs proposals, the 
Clinton plan would extend health 
coverage to all Americans. A govern
ment program would cover the un
employed, and employers would be 
required to cover their employees. 
Acknowledgingthattherequirement 
would be a strain on many small 
businesses, Clinton has also prom
ised to provide a tax credit to those 
businesses. What he hasnt said, 
however, is how he will pay for the 
costly tax credit, or how he will de
cide who gets it.
Bakers ethics in question
WASHINGTON, DC, October 13 (AP)  White 
House chief of staff James A. Baker III, who has 
large oil investments, played a role in the 
administrations effort to lobby Congress on oil 
spill liability in 1990 as Secretary of State, docu
ments show.
The Project on Government Oversight, a liberal 
research group, said the documents raise ethical 
questions about these actions of Baker, who is also 
now heading President Bushs re-election cam
paign.
Spokespeople at the State Department and the 
White House said calls on the matter should be 
directed to Margaret Tutwiler, Bakers spokesper
son at the White House. She didnt immediately 
return a call seeking comment.
The Project on Government Oversight sites a 
memo from then-Transportation Secretary Samuel 
Skinner to Baker indicating the two discussed 
preparing a joint letter urging Congress to approve 
international accords limiting oil companies li
ability for spills. The letter to Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell was signed by Skinner and 
Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting secretary of 
state who was then Bakers deputy, but not by 
Baker.
The letter to Mitchell was part of the Bush 
administrations effort to persuade Congress to 
ratify the international accords capping financial 
liability for oil spills.
Mitchell opposed the international liability lim
its, arguing that they werent strict enough and 
would preempt states liability laws. Lawmakers 
rejected the international agreements.Black voters lean toward Clinton, other Democratic candidates
NEW YORK, October 13 (DJ) 
-iJesse Jackson makes a point of 
not clapping at some of Bill 
Clintons speeches. Rep. Charles 
Rangel of New York, a veteran 
lack leader, says Clinton avoids 
lcissing black babies on televi
sion. Both men, along with some 
other traditional black leaders, 
complain that Clinton is ignoring 
black voters to better pursue dis
affected white Democrats. The 
result is a great deal of media 
attention to the apparent split 
ljetween blacks and Clinton.
; Black voters clearly like Bill 
(jlinton, The Wall Street Journal 
Reported. In the primaries, when 
tiho Democratic field was crowded, 
tlhoy gave him half their vote in 
Now York, around 60 percent in 
California, about three-quarters 
in Florida and Georgia, and even 
riiore in Texas. And hes poised to 
got a huge number of black votes 
in the general election.
' The views of the traditional 
ijlack leadership are diverging
from those of the larger black 
community. While the black lead
ership continues to focus on civilrights issues, a great portion of 
the black communityespecially 
younger and more affluent blacks
 has widened its perspective. 
And Clinton has let hiB campaign 
go with that flow. To black audi
ences, he talks generally about 
the economyas he does in front 
of white audiences  instead of 
tailoring his speech exclusively 
to civil rights. Thats a big change 
for a Democratic candidateone 
that cannily reflects the change 
in the community itself.
Clinton couldnt be more in 
touch with black public opinion, 
says David Bositis, senior re
searcher at the Joint Center for 
Political and Economic Studies, 
a Washington-based black re
search organization that joined 
with Home Box Office in June to 
survey blacks on their views of 
the issues. The survey, he says, 
basically showB that there is wide
andbroadissue agreementinthe 
black community with Bill 
Clintons platform, including his 
planks on crime and welfare re
form, which in many cases differ 
from the views of black leaders. A 
plurality, for instance, said they 
supported capital punishment; 
Jackson and other black leaders 
strongly oppose it.
Many black voters still identify 
themselves as Democrats, but 
more are questioning traditional 
party ties and even rejecting pre
vious Democratic nostrums. They 
have gained new acumen in as
sessing what is in their best in
terest. Most issues shouldnotbe 
defined as black or white, says 
Terry Tate of Terry Tate Realty 
in Atlanta. We all need jobs, we 
all need safety, we all need to be 
rid of the scourge of drugs."
Indeed, blacks progress into 
the middle class has made their 
concerns more in tune with the 
white middle class. According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau, since
1967 the number of black fami
lies it classifies as middle class or 
affluent has nearly quadrupled. 
Those blacks behave economi
cally a lot more than racially, 
says Claiboume Darden Jr., an 
Atlanta pollster who works for 
both parties.
None of this has been lost on 
the Republicans, whose leaders, 
after all, have been saying for 
some time that the best thing a 
president can do for blacks is 
improve the economy generally, 
creating a rising tide that lifts all 
boats. In the past, you would 
think that the only issues con
cerning black Americans were 
civil rights and social issues, says 
Clarence Carter, the National 
Republican Committees director 
of African-American Affairs. 
Weve come to understand that 
the black voter is very much a 
partofeverythingthatis America. 
So we speak to black Americans 
through the same campaign is
sues through which we speak to
the rest of America.
Polls have shown high black 
support for Clinton. To be sure, 
Democrats usually get a massive 
share of the black vote anyway; 
Michael Dukakis received about 
nine out of 10. But the name of 
the game with the black vote is 
turnout. Instead of voting Repub
lican, many blacks just dont vote 
when the Democratic nominee is 
uninspiring. Black voter turnout 
droppedmore sharply than white 
voter turnout from 1984 to 1988.
But there are indications that 
the black vote this year could be 
big, giving Clinton a huge portion 
of a larger pie  and that could 
be critical in some Southern states 
with big black populations. One 
reason is simply that some blacks 
feel President Bush is not sensi
tive on civil-rights and economic 
issues. In addition, a record num
ber of blacks are running nation
wide in several important races. 
If Carol Moseley Braun wins in 
Illinois, for instance, she would
be the only black in the Senate. 
That kind of contest is likely to 
energize black voters.
Jackson, for his part, dismisses 
the idea that his agenda differs 
from that of mainstream blacks. 
Civil rights, Jackson insists, is 
still African-Americansforemost 
issue. When a neighborhood is 
red-lined, its a civil-rights issue, 
a race issue that locks us out of 
economic development, he says. 
The lack of affirmative action 
locks us out of jobs. He disagrees 
that, now that the civil rights 
laws are on the books, its time to 
move on, saying: The Indian 
treaty is on the books, too.
Jackson says Clintons platform 
is fine on most issues, but he 
faults his strategy, which he sees 
as appealing to whites by push
ing away blacks.

10/1 POSSIBLE SCAM, 9:49 
am. Complainant informed Cam
pus Police that a man entered her 
office in Mellon Institute and 
asked for money because his car 
had broken down, but no one in 
the office gave him any money. 
The actor then asked if they had 
a chaplain in the area and was 
told no. At this time the man left 
the area. This man matches the 
description of the suspicious per
son involved in the complaint of 
the Morewood desk attendant on 
October 6.
10/2 MALFUNCTION OF 
SMOKE DETECTORS, 4:58 
pm. Officers found the third floor 
hallway of Morewood Gardens DTower completely engulfed in 
smoke, though the hallway smoke 
detectors had not been activated. 
The source of the smoke was de
termined to be a room where a 
student had just burned toast in 
an electric toaster. The smoke 
detector in this students room 
had been activated. The officers 
borrowed fans from students to 
exhaust the smoke from the area.
10/3 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 9:55 pm. During routine 
patrol of the fraternities, officers 
observed individuals jumping off 
of the roof area covering the en
trance to a fraternity basement. 
The individuals were jumping 
into a crowd of people on the patio 
in an event known as ledge div
ing. The officers were unable to 
determine the identities of the 
jumpers due to the large number 
of people on the patio and the 
distance from which the individu
als were seen. When the house 
was contacted about the events, 
it was reported that brothers were 
just on their way out to stop it. 
Two fraternity brothers came for
ward and admitted that they were 
the jumpers. Both students were 
issued internal citations.
10/4 HARASSMENT, 2:51 pm. 
An organized abortion protest 
was being conducted through the 
city of Pittsburgh along Forbes 
Avenue. A student informed Cam
pus Police that he had been ha
rassed by protesters because of 
his political views. As the stu
dent was crossing Forbes Avenue, 
several protesters held out signs 
to block his forward progress. He 
also said that a CMU student 
protester yelled out, Hey [name], 
why dont you come over here and 
talk to us; you can speak out 
when you are in a large group, 
but not when youre alone. The 
protester said that the only thing 
he said was, Hey [name].
10/6 VANDALISM, 12:15 am. 
Two men were seen striking the 
blinking lights affixed to the con
struction horses at the Tech and 
Frew Street corner construction 
site. After turning his own car

the complainant saw the actors 
enter a mini-van and leave the 
area. The reporting officer, after

tendant reported that a man had 
just asked him for money to get 
home to Butler. When the desk

cause the man could not produce 
a CMU ID card. Campus Police 
encountered the individual walk
ing on Forbes Avenue in front of

call was received on Sunday, Oc
tober 4. When the caller said, I 
need to talk, the complainant 
gave the caller a phone number 
where he could get help, but the 
caller said, "You would not un
derstand, and then hung up. Ten 
minutes later, the caller phoned 
again and said, Guess who this 
is. That was the last call that the 
complainant received until Tues
day, October 6, when the caller 
called again and said, You know 
who this is? The complainant 
said, You again, and the caller 
replied Yes, and dont hang up 
on me again or Ill have to bring 
some equipment over. The com
plainant said that the caller 
sounded like a man in his early 
20s with a very distinguishable 
voice. Officers told the complain

least three times. Each time he 
has asked the woman, What kind 
of panties are you wearing? In

often she pissed in her pants. 
During the third call, he asked 
her if she was pissing in her 
pants at that time. On each occa
sion the woman hung up on the 
caller. She was advised to contact 
Campus Police if she received any 
more of these calls.
10/10 STREAKING, 12:46am. 
Campus Police were informed

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 October 19927
GSO desires greater representation in governmentCMU GOP rallies
Republicans, from page 1.
Sixteen members of the CMU 
College Republicans attended, 
i Between 250 and 300 people went 
; to the rally.
James Thomas, a senior biolo ogy major, is vice chair of the 
campus group. He called the rally 
$ interesting, but too long.
| There were so many speakers 
there, with people in between 
: the speeches introducing them. I 
; thought it was drawn out, but I 
enjoyed the speakers overall,
: said Thomas.
Rob Evans, a junior MechE,
: concurred. It could have been 
shorter, but it was still informa
tive and interesting. He called 
Reagans speech the highlight 
of the rally.
Evans said that Reagan 
means a lot to Republicans ... he 
looks to the future, always. He 
doesnt look to the future with 
doubt. Like he says, Americas 
best days are yet to come. 
Thomas said he was pleased 
with the performance of Bush 
and Quayle in the recent Presi
dential and Vice Presidential de
bates.
No one came away a clear-cut 
winner, said Thomas of the first 
debate. I think Bush did well, 
but he could have done better. 
Thomas was very pleased with 
Quayles performance. He was 
the winner, just because every
one expected him to look like a 
blithering idiot. He defended 
himself well, Thomas said, add
ing that the debate itself disap
pointed him because it looked 
like a fight between two 12-yearolds and their grandfather. 
Evans had a similar assess
ment of Bush and Quayles per
formances. Dan Quayle came 
out swinging.... I liked what he 
had to say, Evans said. He 
spoke well and presented him
self well. People saw that he isnt 
the bumbling idiot that hes made 
out to be.
Evans was critical of the 
medias portrayal of Bushs per
formance. The media seems to 
downplay [his performance], he 
said, But I think he did well and 
... agreed with what he said. He 
said that you should be able to 
trust your leaders. He tried to 
hammer his point across. 
According to Thomas, the Col
lege Republicans plan to have 
some lit drops on campus. Well 
be handing out some non-partisan materials comparing the 
principles of Bill Clinton versus 
those of George Bush. We just 
want to get the information out 
there, said Thomas. Weve been 
getting a lot of bad press lately, 
and it hasnt helped us. Things 
have calmed down since then, 
and I think we have everything 
under control.
It seems that there are two or 
three members of our group that 
are very outspoken, and posted 
some things to the bboards, 
Evans said, though in fairness 
to them, some of the things that 
they said were distorted. Sev
eral of us have spoken to them 
about it. We hope to clear our 
name by keeping them from go
ing off of the deep end.
In addition to Bushs campaign, 
the campus group will be sup
porting state and local GOP can
didates like Representative Rick 
Santorum, Congressional candi
date Byron King, and Senator 
Arlen Specter. I think as we get 
closer to the election, Bushs sup
port will grow. Its going to be a 
tight race, not a blow-out like the 
last two elections, Thomas said, 
hut I think Bush should be able
; to pull it off.
King and Santorum have even 
harder battles ahead of them, 
according to Thom as. King is up 
against a 12-year incumbent 
L William Coyne], and Santorums 
race is even tougher because of 
the gerrymandering of his dis
trict, said Thomas. Santorums 
18th Congressional District was 
recently changed to include the 
heavily Democratic Monongaela River Valley. Santorum 
aces State Senator Frank 
ecora, a Penn Hills Democrat, 
the fall.
GSO, from page 1.
Haverkamp says GSO was set up 
by the University in the same 
way that Senate was. Therefore, 
Senate cannot control the 
amount of funding the Board of 
Trustees gives GSO, and thus 
Senate has no control over GSOs 
funds. Senator Erik Altmann 
(SCS), Campus Affairs Commit
tee chair, posts on assocs.studentsenate, Its misleading to make 
a big deal of the new bylaws, 
which do not significantly change 
the status of GSO as specified in 
the current bylaws.... GSO [has] 
complete control over its own al
locations. Senator Michael 
Loomis (GSIA), Funding & Rec
ognition Committee chair, says, 
There is a concern that Student 
Senate could be setting itself up 
to take over the GSO, not saying 
that anybody would plan that. 
They are very concerned [about 
preserving] their own indepen
dence of their organization, which 
I think is very desirable. Loomis 
also said there should be some 
agreement between Student Sen
ate and GSO in which Senate 
recognizes GSOs independence 
as an organization.
Senator Shawn Knight (MCS), 
Public Relations Chair, posts that 
if graduate students are unhappy 
with or concerned about student 
government, they should seek an 
office in Student Senate. There 
are six seats in Student Senate 
that are reserved exclusively for 
graduate students (3 Heinz, 3 
GSIA), whereas there are no cor
respondingly reserved seats for 
undergraduates. If grad students 
bothered to get involved in stu
dent government, they would 
have all the voice on Senate that 
they needed, posts Altmann on 
assocs.gso. However, Student 
Senate cannot be an adequate 
representative body for graduate
students, according to Wolfson. 
Senate is not structured in such 
a way that most graduate stu
dents can participate  nor is it 
structured... to provide adequate, 
proportional representation to 
graduate students, who represent 
one third of the students at Car
negie Mellon.
In Wolfsons proposal to Sen
ate, graduate students are ex
pected to work 60 to 80 hours a 
week, combining their coursework, their responsibilities as a 
teaching or research assistant, 
and their own research, which 
could involve traveling, which 
therefore does not leave much 
time for the 10 hour a week com
mitment demanded by Senate. 
In addition, Wolfsons proposal 
states, the undergraduate and 
graduate concerns of students are 
very different. For example, while 
undergraduates are represented 
by college, graduate students are 
tied to departments. Jennifer 
Trost, former president of GSO 
and graduate history student, 
says that the fact that Senate is 
open to everyone is somewhat 
irrelevant, [since it] is perceived 
as an undergraduate organiza
tion.... Student Senate does not 
represent the graduate students 
interests, and GSO does.... I dont 
think that saying that graduate 
students should run for Senate 
positions is a proper way to ad
dress the [issue].
Therefore, Senate and GSO 
should have the same kind of 
power, according to Trost. GSO 
has roughly 50 percent male and 
50 percent female members, and 
GSO is run on the department 
level and uses Roberts Rules of 
Order, the rules by which Senate 
meetings are run, only as a guide
line, so GSO meetings conclude 
in a hour and a half. Wolfson 
says, [GSO] doesnt want to be
recognized as a Senate-sponsored 
organization. We want to be rec
ognized as Senates equal [as] a 
branch of student government 
thats not subject to Senate. We 
want to work alongside Senate, 
but we dont want to be subject to 
their rules. In other words, GSO 
seeks to become a third branch of 
student government to cooperate 
with the existing executive and 
legislative branches. Senator 
Matt McGarvey (IM), chair of 
Student Senate, says Senate 
should be restructured so that 
more graduates are represented, 
but making their own student 
body on the graduate level is un
necessary, because there is not a 
separate organization for other 
common interests, such as 
women. If exceptions are made to 
GSO, exceptions have to be made 
to others.... The restructuring of 
Student Senate is seen as an op
portunity or a means to resolve 
some ofthese problems. Altmann 
says that this designation of spe
cial recognition to organizations 
that have special interests leads 
to segregation. Loomis says, If I 
were in GSO, I would want to 
keep the bodies separate to main
tain its independence. If GSO is 
permitted to become too inter
twined in student government, it 
almost seems logical that stu
dent government should take a 
much greater interest in GSO, 
and I dont think thats at all the 
interest of GSO.
Currently, in order for GSO to 
make resolutions or propose 
amendments, the GSO represen
tative must make a report at a 
Senate meeting and ask a Sena
tor who approves of his/her idea 
to propose it. In the Student Sen
ate bylaws, the GSO representa
tive is classified as an ex-officio 
member. Ex-officio members 
hold no parliamentary privileges.
According to Wolfson, As ex
officio, GSO can say and recom
mend, but not until the report. 
Wo cant propose amendments; 
we have no power. Knight feels 
that changing the role of ex-officio 
members is not necessarily a bad 
idea. He says that organizations 
represented by ex-officio mem
bers, which include Greek Coun
cil, Student Dormitory Council, 
and the Activities Board, are all 
important organizations, ... and 
anyone who comes from these 
organizations and says, I am the 
appointed representative, has

obviously in my mind somothing 
positivo to contribute to the meet
ing.... In my personal opinion as a 
Senator, theres no reason why 
ex-officio [representatives] should 
be given more rights, 
parliamentarily speaking, to 
make amendments and contrib
ute more than simply saying 
Maybe a Senator will be willing 
to do this.
Altmann, however, disagrees. 
Its absolutely ludicrous to sup
pose that a member not elected to 
a government body can propose 
legislation.
I. Student Senate has the sole

Notice, too, the opportunities. Like eligibility for 
scholarship programs that can pay tuition, textbooks, 
fees... even $100 in tax-free income each academic 
month.
Visualize a crisp uniform that reflects pride in yourself 
and your ability to accept challenge. Get the picture?

Rally the same day.
Several students had questions 
about how the candidates were 
going to address the concerns of 
black Americans. I think that 
1 for the first time, there are real 
hard-core issues that AfricanAmerican communities can raise 
that are going to have to be ad
dressed by the parties, said King,
who stressed the need for unity

for economic development. Its 
where you spend your dollars that

to national committee
Jill Larkin, associate professor in the Psychology Department, has 
been appointed to the National Science Foundations (NSF) Advi
sory Committee for the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences. 
The committee will provide advice and guidance to the NSF Direc
torate for the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).
The SBE was established in 1991 to respond to the new opportu

Mind Matters symposium 
honors late SCS professor
CMU School of Computer Science is holding the Mind Matters 
symposium on artificial intelligence and current computing technol
ogy in honor of the late professor Allen Newell, who passed away on 
July 19. The event is scheduled for Sunday, October 25 through 27.
Various professors from Princeton University, the University of 
Michigan, and CMU will be giving lectures and discussions on 
artificial intelligence, with emphasis on SOAR, the project for which 
Newell is famous among computer scientists. Lectures are in the 
Carnegie Mellon Research Institute on Fifth Avenue, with demon
strations and videos in the Software Research Institute. Additional 
information is available from the School of Computer Science.
the University address
CMU President Robert Mehrabian gave his state of the Uni vorsity 
address at the Faculty Senate meeting on October 8. Speaking for 
an hour in the Adamson Wing of Baker Hall, Mehrabian spoke about 
ongoing construction projects, new faculty appointments, public 
relations, undergraduate education, and future projects.
Mehrabian was generally positive about CMU as a whole, saying, 
Theres a lot of good things on this campus... lots of good people and 
good will. However, the bulk of his speech focused on improving the 
state of undergraduate education. Mehrabian addressed CMUs 
national rank of 19 according to the U.S. News and World Report 
survey, citing low graduation rate, low freshman retention, and low 
student satisfaction as reasons why CMU was not ranked higher. 
This is not a satisfactory level from my perspective, said Mehrabian.
Among other topics, Mehrabian said that construction of the new 
GSIA building would be completed in January, on budget and on 
schedule.
He also said construction bids for the long-awaited University 
Center will be collected by late November, and updating of the 
Chemistry Department laboratory space will be forthcoming. 
Mehrabian then fielded questions from faculty members concerning 
tuition, the advisory board, and the board of trustees. Faculty Senate 
meets on the second Thursday of each month. President Mehrabian 
was originally scheduled to speak at the September 10 meeting.

Tame debate means bad 
news for Bush campaign
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
Tartan Staffwriter
RICHMOND, October 16  Informa
tion, not innuendo, was the dominant 
theme of Thursdays Presidential de; bate where President Bush, fighting to 
catch up to front runner Bill Clinton, 
;was stymied by a debate format that 
, kept talk focused on the issues.
The University of Richmond debate 
audience, composed entirely of unde
cided voters, managed to keep the de
bate centered on domestic issues rang
ing from jobs, the deficit, health care 
and others, with one questioner asking 
the candidates to stop dwelling on char
acter.
Independent candidate Ross Perot im
mediately responded, saying I couldnt 
agree with you more. Lets get off of this 
mud-wrestling.
Bush, who had made a point of attack
ing Clintons character, wasnt as quick 
to agree, saying that having a strong 
character is part of being President.
Another member of the debate audi
ence, Marisa Hall, tried to move the 
arguments to a more personal level, chal
lenging the candidates to reply to her 
question, How has the national debt 
personally affected each of your lives?
Even with Halls self-admitted clumsy 
phrasing, Bush was able to discern the 
;meaning of her question. Are you sug
gesting that if somebody has means that 
the national debt doesnt affect them? 
he asked.
Clinton replied to Halls question by 
saying that his 12 years as Arkansas 
'governor put him in touch with the prob
lems of working people, while Perot re
plied that he left his personal life and got 
involved with politics because he was 
worried about the deficit.
Bush and Clinton disagreed over the 
extent necessary for educational reform. 
Bush said that parents should have the 
right to choose among private and public 
schools and the resulting competition 
would help improve them all.
; Clinton replied that he favored school
choice, but didnt think that government 
funds should be used outside of the pub
lic school system.
Perot, who claimed to be a battlescarred veteran from his attempts at 
reforming Texas educational system, 
said that there was no need to spend 
more money on education and that local 
reform was the key to improvement. 
Also, said the billionaire, if he could 
wish for one thing for great public schools, 
itd be a strong family unit in every 
home.
After the debate, Perot left the con
verted basketball arena telling report
ers, I enjoyed it, but without making 
predictions for Election Day.
The other two presidential hopefuls 
left the debate site to attend their own 
post-debate rallies, where they cel
ebrated with their campaign faithful.
I think I did all right on the issues. 
How sweet the victory will be when we 
show the pollsters they are wrong, said 
Bush. I need you to vote on November
3.
Clinton, speaking across town at the 
Richmond Mariott, said as little as pos
sible in order to preserve his voice for the 
next debate. Keeping his remarks brief, 
the Democratic nominee told his sup
porters, This country has been around 
for more than 200 years because at ev
ery critical juncture we have had the 
courage to change.
After the candidates left, the pundits 
took over. PBS Mark Shields thought 
Clinton shone at the debate. You win a 
debate by being better informed, more 
comfortable and more at ease than your 
opponent  [Clinton] was.
Governor William Weld (D-Mass.) dis
agreed, saying [Bush] came out the 
winner on the issues of substance.
Bush operative Mary Matalin, work
ing at the media filing centers Spin 
Alley said Clinton has lied in each and 
every race in Arkansas and that there 
were clear differences between Clinton 
and Bush on taxes and crime.
The next and final debate will be Mon
day in East Lansing, Michigan.
Gore draws crowds at downtown campaign rally
GORE, from page 1.
The rally had its share ofimportant 
speakers other than Gore. Pennsylva
nia Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel 
spoke on local issues concerning labor 
and urban development, and U.S. 
Senator George Mitchell, Senate ma
jority leader, spoke on congressional 
issues in the Democratic party.
Mitchell then introduced Senato
rial candidate Lynn Yeakel, who spoke 
for her own campaign and in support 
f Gores candidacy.
In his speech, Gore condemned 
Bushs smear campaign against 
Clintons personal life with regard to 
his visit to Russia during his stay at 
Oxford and his opposition to the Viet
nam War.
Gore accused Bush of abuse of his
privileges, citing Bushs alleged use 
of State Department resources to look 
up personal information on Clinton, 
and of the Presidents ambivalence 
with regard to economic aid for Iraq 
immediately before the invasion of 
Kuwait. Gore also pushed Clintons 
health care plan with the right to a 
doctor, making the analogous refer
ence to the constitutional right to a 
lawyer.
Like any other large gathering, the 
rally had its share of dissenters. Pro
life activists silently held up signs and 
marched around the crowd as Gore 
spoke.
Also, Bush/Quayle supporters 
handed out pamphlets and flyers in 
support of the Republican ticket be
fore and during the speech.
Cliffe has come ... and gone.

Cliffe Knechtle, a 12-year veteran of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF), evangelized at CMU for the fourth time last

and Thursday afternoons, while IVCF members videotaped his appearance.
Ex-Perot campaigner speaks to students
PEROT, from page 1.
Luce offered California as an example. 
To get Perot on the ballot, we needed to 
get 500,000 signatures. We wanted to 
get 1,000,000, but we ended up getting 
1,500,000 in California alone.... In some 
states, over 50 percent of registered vot
ers signed petitions.
Luce pointedly criticized the two ma
jor political parties. The Democratic 
and Republican national campaigns are 
running the election based on the les
sons they thought they learned in 1988, 
said Luce. Unfortunately, he said, the 
lessons are ill-learned.
The former campaign operative took 
pains to point out what he termed the 
growing irrelevance of party affiliation. 
When I worked at the national cam
paign headquarters, I never had one 
volunteer ask me if Perot was conserva
tive, liberal, or moderate. Instead, said 
Luce, volunteers wanted their candi
date to just fix the problem.
Some of the points that Luce made 
began to sound like echoes of similar 
ideas Perot attempted to pound home in 
last weeks presidential debates. Accord
ing to Luce, a United States senator 
once told him, Deep down in our hearts, 
we know we have bankrupted the coun
try. We have defrauded America in or
der to get elected.
Throughout the lecture, Luce contin
ued to echo his ex-boss, saying that the 
standard of living has doubled every 1.6 
generations since the 1940s. Now, he 
said, because of the current state of the 
economy, the standard of living will take 
12 generations to double, and people 
know something must be done.
The American people know some
things not right. The commonality of 
the Perot movement was [the consen
sus] that the system doesnt work, and 
the tired dialogue doesnt work, said
Luce.
However, Luce didnt always repeat 
Perots positions verbatim. While Perot 
during the second presidential debate 
said that educational spending should 
not be increased, Luce took what seemed 
to be the opposite stand, saying The 
difference between spending on the eld
erly and children is pretty stark, and 
claiming the government spends eight 
times as much on senior citizens as on 
children.If we abandon the public edu
cation system, were abandoning democ
racy, Luce said.
The former gubernatorial candidate 
concluded by saying that technology can 
help reform democracy. This is the start 
of a pretty big wave. Its our own 
democracys way of dealing with forces 
which have already confronted Russia, 
Germany, and other countries, said 
Luce. Information flow was a central 
part of that revolution.

By a 16-3 vote at the October 6 meet
ing, Student Senate changed the status 
of the Voices United Gospel Choir 
(VUGC)from funded to non-funded. This 
means that VUGC v/ill now be funded by 
independent fundraisers or special allo
cations from Student Senate but not by 
the Student Activities Fee.
This decision came after weeks of 
debate regarding the supposed religious 
nature of VUGC. Student Senates by
laws state that only non-academic, non
political, non-religious organizations 
may be recognized as funded. [Article
5, Section 2, Subsection B, Paragraph 
1.]
Throughout the controversy the Sena
tors frequently referred to the VUGC 
Lift Up Holy Hands concert which was
presented last May. During this concert 
numerous religious references were 
made by both VUGC officers and invited 
speakers. In a post to the assocs.studentsenate bulletin board, Funding and 
Recongition chair Michael Loomis pre
sented a summary of the concert which 
included a number of these references.
Loomis quoted Dottie Presley, the 
mistress of ceremonies, as sayingPeople 
do need the Lord, and Nancy Culter, 
the intermission speaker as saying We 
are here to serve a mighty God.
In addition to these overtly religious 
statements, the VUGC Chaplain read 
scripture during the concert. This lent 
to the revival atmosphere of the con
cert which could only be the natural 
outgrowth of a religious group, accord
ing to Loomis.
Student government treasurer Jay 
Laefer said, There is no doubt in my
mind that VUGC is a religious organiza
tion. Referring to the concert, he said, 
There appears to be no reason to believe 
that VUGC will stop these religious ac
tivities." Hence, VUGC should no longer 
be funded by the Student Activities Fee, 
he asserted.
Meanwhile, VUGC claimed (and still 
claims) to be non-religious. Our main 
function is to teach gospel music," said 
Tara Haughton, president of VUGC. 
Gospel music alone does not teach, dis
ciple, instruct, or exclude people on the 
basis of one set of beliefs, she said.
Haughton expressed disappointment 
that few Senators took time to see both 
sides ofthe issue. Senator Eri k Altman n 
said that his view of this issue is fair 
and consistent application of Senates 
bylaws. Were VUGC to remain funded, 
it would be incumbent on Senate to con
sider funding Bible study groups as well.

FORUM
Change student govt, improve representation
%ara Wolfson, the president of the Graduate Student Organization (GSO), read a statement in;last Tuesdays Student Senate meeting proposing that the relationship between GSO and Seriate be formalized and that GSO be made the official goverhing body of graduate students.We agree with Wolfson that G$0 should become the representative body of graduate students  this seems to be what m^ny graduate students want. We see two alternatives for achieving this goal.The first way is to keep and document the current relationship between Senate and GSO. Right now, the Activities Fee is spfit between GSO and Senate; 37i percent of all graduate students Activities Fees are given to GSO. The rest of the graduate students Activities Fees and all of the undergraduate students Activities Fees go to Senate for allocation to student organizations.However, no one seems to knbw of any written record of this arrangement. This is unacceptable. If Senate and GSO decide to maintain the current arrangement, they must put it in writing in order to avoid future confusion.The other alternative to solve the dilemma between GSO and Senate would be to restructure them into two separate legislate bodies under the existing executive branch. We are in favor of this option because it is fair to graduate students but still allows one government for the1 student body.There are many questions whjch need to be answered regaidless of which course is chosei^: ! What kinds of checks and balances are there on GSO? Thdre are currently none. However, if the executive' branch were expanded, it could act as a check on GSO. The student body President and Treasurer could have thelsame powers over GSO they now have over Senate. How should the bylaws of the student body be written? Under the current system, GSO has
one set of rules and Senate has another. If GSO and Senate were combined, they would have one set of bylaws. This is easier than it sounds. The executive branch and fiscal policy would be described in a section pertaining to the entire student body. The section describing the legislative branch would have two parts: one about the undergraduate organization and one about the graduate organization. How should organizations get recognition and funding? Right now, organizations can get funded from both GSO and Senate. If Senate rejects an allocation, GSO might pay for it. Also, while an organization might be recognizedby GSO, Senate might not recognize it and vice versa. This is not equitable. If an organization is recognized by Senate or GSO, the other governing body should honor that recognition. Also, an organization should be able to get its budget only from Senate or G>0. Both GSO and Senate could give any organization a special allocation. How should the Activities Fees of graduate students be divided up? Senate should remain the primary funding body of student organizations and should therefore still get a portion of graduate students Activities Fees. Also, some Senate-funded groups benefit the entire campus.It is very important that the action taken is one that a plurality of graduate students favor. (A plurality is defined as more people in favor of something than against it.) Due to the level of apathy on this campus, it is generally very hard to see how a large portion of the campus community feels. An easy way to collect opinions from those who have them needs to be devised. A general referendum probably would not work well based on past experience.For whatever reason, the current structure of student government isnt serving graduate students, and GSO is. Therefore, we believe the structure should be changed to make GSO the representative organization for graduate students.

On October 8, President Mehrabian gave his state of the University address. He congratulated the University on the progress that has been made in the last year, pointing out the rise in the U.S. News and World 
Report ranking from 24th to 19th, but he also drew attention to the poor student satisfaction rating and low graduation rate and stressed his desire to amend this;.It' is very reassuring that Mehrabian places so much emphasis on the happiness and wellbeing of undergraduates, especially at this university, where faculty and graduate research can easily overshadow the average undergrad.Tliere are some specific points he dnd the rest of the administration need to address.

Restifos position, 
but I think it is im
portant to show it for 
what it really is. It is often easier to lay 
the blame on others for the cause of our 
troubles. However, Restifo fails to real
ize the scope of the problem. The prob
lem is not with the so-called radical 
groups he names; the problem is with 
him. The problem with supporting the 
status-quo is that he leaves no room for 
the continual changing face of our na
tion. He leaves no room for personal 
adaption. Through my perception, he 
wishes to limit the personal freedoms of 
all individuals and encourage stereo
types.
In his opinion, all who have an opinion 
different than his are blatantly wrong. 
Also, so-called radicals are very amus
ing. Since when has being a Fine Arts 
major been considered radical. I have 
never heard vegetarian used as an in

Thankfully, our friends in the depart

enlightened moral sense to refrain from 
advocating the extermination of people

The College Republicans cannot claim 
that this despicable gay-bashing is 
merely an exercise of their right to free

Court has repeatedly held that personal 
insults, especially those intended to in
cite violence, do not fall within the cat

the First Amendments guarantee of free

If we take nothing else from higher

been a black mark against CMU for many years now. Were glad Mehrabians made the Center one of the top priorities; after so many years of waiting, the administration owes it to the students .Also, the gym needs to be improved regardless of what athletic facilities will be available in the University Center. Other schools of our caliber have athletic facilities that far outshine ours.While Mehrabians attention to undergraduate life is commendable, it is disheartening that graduate students were not mentioned at all in his address. Their needs and desires should be heard on the scale of the entire University. As CMUs reputation grows, it becomes increasingly important that the focus be placed upon all of the students, considering their satisfaction and happiness along with academic excellence.
Editor:
As a new student at 
Carnegie Mellon, I 
have been appalled by 
the conduct of the Col
lege Republicans dur
ing the current politi
cal campaign. The comments made by 
certain College Republicans on the elec
tronic bulletin board, which proposed 
gas[sing] the queers and booing the 
fag actors, marked a new low in what 
has already been a disheartening politi
cal season.
Such statements, placed into circula
tion on a computer network which is 
readily accessible to the entire campus, 
cannot be passed off as a joke. There is 
nothing amusing aboutgassing queers, 
a tactic utilized most notoriously by Adolf 
Hitler, who slaughtered thousands of 
homosexuals in death camps during 
World War II. Other proponents of mass 
genocide in recent history include Josef 
Stalin and Saddam Hussein. These are 
strange role models indeed for young 
people who purport to represent a politi
cal party which came into existence in 
order to fight slavery.
As for booing the fag actors, even a 
cursory investigation by the College 
Republicans would have revealed that 
the individuals who covered the Repub
licans message on the fence were not 
associated with the Drama Department. 
Moreover, the implicit assumption that 
all dramats are gay is simply inaccu
rate. Like most departments on this 
campus, the Drama Department is a
Office. After hearing our complaint, he 
personally sent a letter to Chambers 
Development Co. emphasizing their con
tractual obligations and our willingness 
to suspend payments if they were un
able to meet our requirements immedi
ately. This seemed to have the desired 
effect, so that trash is now, to the best of 
our knowlege, collected after 8 am.
Students should be aware that they do 
not have to suffer in silence because of 
these kinds of problems. Representative 
organizations on campus, such as SDC 
and Student Senate, exist to help solve 
these kinds of annoyances, but they are 
considerably more effective when stu
dents are active in voicing their con
cerns. We at SDC constantly work to 
resolve issues affecting resident stu
dents. If garbage trucks, or any other 
residence hall problem persists, please

removal in the early morning. The Stu
dent Dormitory Council (SDC) has been 
working to correct this problem since 
August. We felt that it was important to 
outline the steps the SDC Housing Com
mittee has taken to address this matter.
Last year when this was a problem, 
the Housing Committee talked with Barb 
Kviz of the office of Environmental 
Health and Safety and Tony Martin, 
director of Housing, to stop the early 
morning intrusion of garbage trucks by 
Chambers Development Co. After point
ing out to Chambers their contractual 
obligation to pick up trash near dorms 
after 8 am they complied with our re
quest.
At the beginning of this school year, 
the garbage pick-up was again a prob
lem. So we met with Ms. Kviz in late 
August and explained the situation. She 
told us that the trucks were coming 
early because they did not want to inter
fere with residents moving into dorms 
during the day. She assured us that the 
situation would be fixed by the time 
classes started. We were dismayed, how
ever, when a week passed and the trucks 
were still coming well before 8 am, dis
turbing many residents sleep.
We returned and complained to Kviz 
many times, each time stressing the 
inconvenience this caused residents. She 
assured us she was doing everything 
possiblecalling and sending letters to 
the garbage removal company  to get 
them to change their pick-up times in 
accordance with the contract. Regard
less of her efforts, the disturbance per
sisted.

Clinton provides clear choice in debate
Christian M. Restifo
There is a line in a Genesis 
song that says, Take the danger 
out of a naked flame, and what 
have you got? We saw this same 
sentiment come alive last Thurs
day night when Bush, Clinton, 
and Perot were all stripped of the 
protection provided by sound 
bites, short responses, and dis
tance from real voters. And while 
Clinton offered specific answers 
to specific questions, Bush floun
dered without the protection of 
his empty character issue. It 
was great.
For the first time, Bush heard 
it straight from real voters that 
they didnt want the mud-sling
ing. In other words, on the third 
question of the debate, Bush was 
henceforth forced to argue his 
points based on fact, policy, and 
specific ideas. He had none.
Clinton, on the other hand, 
showed that regardless of what 
you think about the tax and 
spend liberal label, he has real 
plans that many experts say will 
succeed. Out of 13 questions, he 
answered no fewer than eight 
with point-by-point explanations 
of how to handle issues ranging 
from health care to gun control. 
Bush, on the other hand, offered 
only a few specific answers. Perot, 
using his theres lots of great
plans sound bite cop-out, pro
vided roughly one real answer 
about how he would ensure fair 
trade.
So lets look at what was said 
and how that reflects upon the 
competency of the candidates.
Bush said the way to solve the 
health care problem was to cap 
the malpractice lawsuits that cost 
twenty to thirty billion dollars a 
year. Any type of government 
interference, he theorized, would 
reduce the quality of healthcare. 
Clinton, on the other hand, ex
tended a detailed system of man
aged competition including na
tional guidelines that, if followed, 
could be used to show a doctor 
was not negligent. As noted by 
many interested in this issue, a 
bipartisan commission said that 
Clintons plan would cover every
one and save more money than 
Bushs plan. Perot mentioned 
another one of those ethereal 
great plans.
Bush tried to take the show 
when asked about the infrastruc
ture of the nation. Mentioning 
the bill that provides $150 billion 
for roads, he said he was very 
proud of it. Clintons proposed 
system, on the other hand, 
handles many problems at one 
time with $20 billion a year over 
the next four years. It would in
vest in transportation, new tech
nologies like waste recycling, and 
help people with the shift from a 
defense-based economy to a 
peacetime one.
We really saw how Bush lacked
substance when Clinton pointed 
out that a bill containing enter
prise zones was killed because 
people in higher income brackets 
would have footed the bill. Bush 
had no qualifying response.
The education President was 
anything but that when a voter 
asked about the issue of educat
ing people. He used his usual 
they hate private schools re
education plan. Without so much 
as missing a beat, he explained 
how the current system works 
and how his would pay for pro
grams. Bushs simple school 
choice bit paled in comparison.
One voter surprised me with 
his rather in-depth question 
about social security and pension 
guarantees. Regardless of how 
you feel about these issues, the
... while Clinton offered specific 
answers to specific questions, Bush 
floundered without the protection of 
his empty character" issue.
sponse, but Clinton showed that 
hes thought about this one. For 
example, only he mentioned pro
grams about literacy and assist
ing adults in obtaining a high 
school education.
Perhaps one of the best exem
plars of why this format should 
be used in the future came when 
Clinton nailed Bush on his claim 
that the government was spend
ing more than any other country 
on education. Bush factored in 
Pell grants and money for col
leges. Look at public schools and 
what they face, however, and you 
get quite a different story.
Clinton also showed that hes 
on top of things when his answer 
was followed up with the ques
tion of how he would pay for his
way the candidates answered the 
question showed a great deal 
about how in touch they are with 
the issues. Bush admitted to not 
knowing much about anything 
while Perot pulled out the great 
plans response. Clinton ex
plained certain things (such as 
social security providing a sur
plus) and discussed how to handle 
the future financial security of 
the program.
The question that shocked me 
more than any other was the very 
last one dealing with when each 
candidate saw his party nomi
nating and electing a black per
son or a woman to the Presi
dency. If you ignore Clintons 
rhetoric about the world being a 
better place if women ran it, his
was the only answer possessing 
any quality. By mentioning that 
issues of womens pay and nonCaucasian elected officials, he 
showed right then and there that 
he possesses an awareness Bush 
does not. (Because the questioner 
did not allow the candidates to 
answer with past nominations or 
appointments, Bush had an ex
tremely hard time answering. 
Perot did, too.)
Contrary to what many conser
vatives believe, I am a moderate. 
The reason I find Clinton to be 
the best candidate is that he has 
provided solutions that I have 
judged as having the potential 
for success. Bush offers me only 
the character question, some
thing that I do not care about. 
Perot says I can fix it. Anybody 
can say it. Doing it is another 
matter altogether.
The debate last Thursday 
showed that Clinton is the clear 
choice. You may not like some of 
his plans, and you may be stupid 
enough to buy into the Pavlovian 
response generated by Bush with 
his tax and spend liberal bell. 
But you have to admit the man 
has thought about it. Experts and 
business people agree he can 
change things. If either Bush or 
Perot really is the better candi
date, I challenge their support
ers to prove it.

Christian Republicans need more Christianity
Jeffrey J. Basista
Republicans are in favor of Christian 
values: true or false?
A good way to answer this question 
might be to go to a primary source of 
Christian values, Jesus himself, and see 
how well key Republicans pay attention 
to his words.
Lets start with the value of truth. In a 
quick scan of the Gospel of John, I counted 
15 spots in which Jesus starts speaking 
by saying, Truly, truly I say unto you. 
It would be an understatement to say 
that truth was important to him. Re
member what he said: For this I was 
born, and for this I have come into the 
world, to bear witness to the truth .... 
(John 18.37, RSV)
Do Republicans bear witness to the 
truth?
Marilyn Quayle recently told an audi| ence that we had 14 percent unemploy
ment under Jimmy Carter. The truth is 
that since 1957, weve only had double
digit unemployment once: from SeptemI ber 1982 through June 1983, under Ro
nald Reagan.
Her husband, Dan Quayle, tells us 
that our economy is inefficient because
we have too many lawyers. In fact, he says, 
we have 70 percent of the worlds lawyers. 
If you only count people who are allowed to 
argue cases in court, then this is true, 
because most countries restrict this privi
lege. Most of the legal professionals in 
Japan whom we would call corporate law
yers are not lawyers by Quayles defini
tion, even though they perform the same 
functions as most U.S. corporate lawyers.
Ronald Reagan, the living legend of the 
Republican Party, pays little attention to 
truth. Someone wrote a whole book about 
Reagans reign of error, citing dozens of 
outright lies in his speeches. By lies, I 
mean statements that can be proven in
correct, not arguable, philosophical issues 
on which reasonable people can disagree. 
The man whom many Republicans regard 
as a role model and hero is an expert liar.
Jesus said Judge not, that you be not judged 
(Matthew 7:1), but Robertson and Buchanan 
spend most of their time spouting hateful invec
tive, judging and condemning...
If you define lawyers by what they do, 
rather than by their qualification to argue 
a case in court, the U.S. actually has fewer 
lawyers per capita than many of its com
petitors. Quayle doesnt tell us this be
cause it proves his argument to be phony. 
Quayle is lying by deceptive presentation 
of facts. Being technically correct isnt nec
essarily being truthful.
Quayles boss, George Bush, has been 
telling us for years that he had nothing to 
do with the Iran-Contra scandal. Does any
body believe him now? The evidence against 
him continues to pile up, and he continues 
to lie.
You might say that the Democrats have 
their share of liars. That may be true, but 
Republicans claim to have higher moral 
standards. Republicans claim to value 
Christian principles. Their claims, how
ever, seem empty. Given a choice between 
making themselves look good or bearing 
witness to the truth, Republicans have 
consistently chosen the former.
Not only do they lie, but they dont nec
essarily practice what they preach. Ro
nald Reagan, a divorced man whose chil
dren have had unflattering things to say 
about his behavior as a father, will happily 
lecture you on family values. George Bush,
who consistently bows to the interests of 
right-wing zealots, criticizes Bill Clinton 
for panderingto special interests. We know 
what Jesus would think of this, because ho 
preached against hypocrisy:
Why do you see the speck that is in your 
brothers eye, but do not notice the log that 
is in your own eye? Or how can you say to 
your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of 
your eye,  when there is the log in your own 
eye? (Matthew 7:3-4, RSV)
How can Christians, who preach love 
and compassion, tolerate Republican sup
port for Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan? 
Jesus said Judge not, that you be not 
judged (Matthew 7:1), but Robertson and 
Buchanan spend most of their time spout
ing hateful invective, judging and con
demning as many as they can, sanctimo
niously dividing the country into the Good 
and the Bad.
While we watch them and other Repub
lican leaders proclaim their moral superi
ority, we should keep in mind these words 
of Jesus: Beware of false prophets, who 
come to you in sheeps clothing but in
wardly are ravenous wolves. You will know 
them by their fruits. (Matthew 7:15-16)
The fruits of the Republican Party are 
lies, hypocrisy, and hatred. These are not 
Christian values, at least not according to 
Christianitys founder.

English who studies the history of Christi
anity in his spare time.

freshmen are the most hot-headed 
members of the campus commu

malice (unitentional or not, I dont

hold leadership positions within 
their organizations. Yet, given 
these rather well-known facts, 
Restifo did not choose to speak 
with the leaders of the CRs. In
stead, he generalized that the 
ngly issues brought up by these 
reshmen members are the sole 
concern of the CRs. Any person 
with the resources Restifo had 
could have easily contacted other

their comments either on the real 
JftSUeS or on the comments of the 
three freshmen members. This
would have presented at least a 
more accurate and more diverse 
view of the thoughts of the Col
lege Republican members.
Given the past writings of 
Restifo, one could easily conclude 
that Restifo is not a conservative 
republican nor a member of the 
CRs. I believe Restifo used this 
encounter to provoke a hatred of 
the College Republicans. After 
all, if you cant sway students to 
your viewpoint by beating the 
CRs leaders in a debate or by 
writing a leftist article in an envi

paper to counter, why not attack 
their organization by quoting 
three overeager freshman? Just 
think, he had the gall to accuse 
the Republicans of winning vot

Coverage unfair

Editor:
Sunday af
ternoon, Octo
ber 4, 850,000 
pro-lifers from 
600 cities na
tionwide took place in an event 
called National Life Chain. This 
chain was instituted by right to 
life activists to show our resolve 
to a cause that we truly believe 
in. According to [Feature photo, 
page 5,10/5], 700 demonstrators 
alone took part in the Pittsburgh 
portion of this chain.
However, for the secondyear in 
a row, the Carnegie Mellon Asso
ciation For Life took part in the 
chain and received no publicity 
whatsoever from The Tartan. The 
Tartan showed a counter-protest 
of this event by ATO brothers, 
but failed to recognize the twelve 
Association For Life members 
who were located in front of 
Morewood Gardens on Forbes
Avenue. A reporter from The Tar
tan spoke with several members 
of our group, and we were photo
graphed, yet no mention was 
made of our presence. I talked to 
the photographer, and he told me 
that the pictures had not come 
out well, but why did we not re
ceive any coverage whatsoever? 
After all, this day belonged to hun
dreds of thousands of pro-lifers.
The Association For Life has 
grown tired of not receiving ap
propriate press for its activities. 
If The Tartan needs advance no
tice of these important events, 
we would be more than happy to 
provide them with the informa
tion. We will continue to show 
our beliefs to the people on this 
campus, and would appreciate 
media coverage when the situa
tion is appropriate. The Tartan 
must learn to show both sides of

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 October 1992
Character issue fails for Bush in debates
Abby Schiff
I think all human beings have a natu
ral tendency to hibernate like bears dur
ing winter. The only difference is: in
stead of curlingup in a den and sleeping, 
we opt for a couch, grab the remote 
control in one hand and a bag of potato 
chips in the other, and vegetate. October 
chilly as it is in Pittsburgh  seems a 
splendid time for beginning the yearly 
ritual: a signal to change my sheets if I 
havent already and settle down for a 
ftice, sedentary, winter.
This year, however, is a different mat
ter entirely. October is our wake-up call, 
our reminder that there is still much to 
be done before winter sets in. We are 
about to elect the next president of the 
United States, and whoever he is, he 
will be influencing issues like the 
Economy, reproductive rights, and the 
environment for years to come. For this 
reason, we must look at the candidates: 
who they are and where they stand. 
And, perhaps most importantly, we must 
resolve the character issue, for it has 
become an important and revealing fac
tor in this campaign.
The recent flood of character accusa
tions from the Bush camp, on issues 
such as Bill Clintons Vietnam-era ac
tivities, has done little to rejuvinate 
Bushs sagging polls. Clearly, Bushs reelection strategyplaying up the Gulf 
War victory and attacking Clintons 
character-has backfired. Why has this
happened? Could be that the poor state 
of the economy overshadows character 
in most recession-battered voters minds? 
Does the deluge of mudslinging from 
Bush and Quayle look silly in light of 
their own character flaws? Perhaps both 
are true: Americas voters, tired of strug
gling along in the sluggish economy, 
have also discovered the rather potent 
strain of hypocrisy underlying charac
ter assassination, and responded to it.
George Bush is a kinder, gentler presi
dent, according to statements issued 
from his own oft-read lips. Why is he 
leaking scads of character-bashing 
Clinton information to the media? As 
most of us know already, Bush has a 
lousy economic recordthe worst since 
Herbert Hoover. So stand back and let 
the mudslinging  excuse me, kinder, 
gentler mudslinging  begin.
First of all, lets concede that theres a 
difference between our normal political 
scuffle and the free-for-all that tends to 
grab the headlines. Some of the issues 
that Bush brings up are actually rel
evant  Clintons draft evasion, for in
stance, is probably something that most 
Americans are interested in knowing 
about. But as the GOP digs farther and 
farther back into Clintons personal life, 
uncovering senseless issues like the 
Russian vacation scandal, voters be
come increasingly alienated to every
thing Bush has to say. (Some are wait
ing amusedly to see whats next  scandalous revelations like BUSH: 
CLINTON KEPT MOM IN LABOR FOR 
25 HOURS DURING BIRTH!) These 
numerous, petty attention-grabbersmay 
keep the jobs-lost-this-month statistics 
on page 2 for the time being, but even the 
American public has wised up this year;
as the polls show clearly, were not fall
ing for it.
Vice-President Dan Quayle has at
tacked Clintons character even more 
viciously than Bush, particularly dur
ing the vice-presidential debate last 
week. Perhaps it was a ploy to get voters 
to take him seriously, but the vice presi
dent only tarnished my already dismal 
image of him. I wish someone would tell 
Quayle that third grade is over, that
snagged a coveted spot in the Indiana 
National Guard. He served in the armed 
forces, but he dodged the draft and 
avoided service in Vietnam. A lot of 
young men did this in one way or an
other, so taken by themselves, both 
Quayles and Clintons actions arent 
even all that unusual.
There is one important difference: 
Quayle supported the war in Vietnam. 
He favored sending young Americans
These numerous, petty attention-grabbers 
may keep the jobs-lost-this-month statistics 
on page 2 for the time being, but even the 
American public has wised up this year; as 
the polls show clearly, we're not falling for it
bombarding your opponent with a cho
rus of whiny You did not!s and acting 
like a five-year-old with serious behav
ioral problems, will improve his image 
no more than did that whole potatoe 
mess.
Quayle foolishly set himself up for 
criticism by mercilessly attacking 
Clintons questionable draft record dur
ing the debate. True, Clinton got special 
treatment, and, it seems, lied to the 
public about it. While its not something 
that the entire election should hinge on, 
its a valid point and worth mentioning. 
But Quayle seems to have forgotten his 
own draft-dodging during Vietnam: in
stead of getting drafted into the army 
and going to war like most other servicebound young men at the time, Quayle, 
through his familys connections,
over there to fight and die for what he 
believed in, as long as he wasnt one of 
them. Clinton, on the other hand, mor
ally opposed the war. Sure, he got out of 
fighting in it; but at least he was consis
tent and didnt try to get other young 
men to die in his place. Poor Dan Quayle 
were it not for his connections, he may 
have had to fight his own battles: quel 
horror!
Clinton has an additional advantage 
over Bush on the character issue that, 
sadly, has received less press in election 
coverage than did the whole inhalation 
fiasco. There have been a few too many 
circumventions of the Constitution dur
ing the past two Republican administra
tions for most folks to accept  most 
notably Iran-Contra and Iraqgate. Vot
ers havent forgotten how Bush, in 1988,
wrapped himself in the American flag 
and addressed important issues of th 
day like the Pledge of Allegiance. Now, 
information is surfacing that Bush may 
have been more involved in Iran-Contra 
than he has admitted. If these allega: 
tions are true, the American public dei 
serves an explanation of why the vice* 
president flagrantly violated the Con; 
stitution. This, after all, is more than an 
issue of character; it concerns the future 
of democracy in our nation.
The bottom line is this: does anyone 
really care about whether or not Clinton 
inhaled or lied about the draft? Yes, but 
only to a certain extent. Clinton has 
been less than candid about several 
matters and it only reinforces his imag 
as a slick politician. But the fact is, all 
politicians are slickBush and Quayle 
included. Anyone who saw the vice-presi
dential debate viewed firsthand the strik
ing difference between a normal per. 
sonthe stumbling Admiral Stockdale
 and two career politicians who pre^ 
pared speeches and snappy retorts7 
weeks beforehand.
Voters, in fact, care about character 
more than Bush might expect. We ar 
beginning to wise up and understand 
the difference between mud-slung char
acter issues like Gennifer Flowers and 
the character of a president who has 
allowed our country to deteriorate to the 
extent that it has.
These are the issues that matter: th 
economy, the national debt, and health 
care. What Bush tries to pass off as 
character, the voters seem to be saying* 
will just have to wait until these enor
mous problems are solved.

ture which gives members of The 
Tartans Editorial Board the op
portunity to express their indi
vidual opinions. Editors Notebook 
presents the opinions of the indi

ily the opinions of The Tartan or 
of the Editorial Board.
' Our Student Senate is made up 
of 18 men and four women. This 
;Senate is in the process of dis
cussing new bylaws for the Student Body. The bylaws use the 
generic masculine he, his, and 
him as pronouns that apply not 
only to men, but to everyone.
Some members of the audience, 
including myself, protested at 
Tuesdays Senate meeting be
cause the generic masculine ex
cludes women. Many Senators 
disagreed, and gave arguments 
that tended to include the phrase, 
Well, it doesnt bother me. Not 
surprising, considering that most
of them are men, so they arent 
excluded by it. An amendment to 
make the wording gender neu
tral failed 8-8-3.
Its important to me that people 
understand why I feel so strongly 
that the generic masculine should 
be avoided, and I want to try to 
explain that here.
The best metaphor Ive ever 
seen to explain my position is 
given by Marilyn Frye in an es
say called Oppression in a book 
titled The Politics of Reality. 
Imagine this, and see if it makes 
my position clearer. Consider a 
birdcage. If you look very closely 
at just one wire in the cage, you 
cannot see the other wires. If 
your conception of what is before 
you is determined by this myopic 
focus, you could look at that one
wire, up and down the length of 
it, and be unable to see why the 
bird would not just fly around the 
wire any time it wanted to go 
somewhere....
It is only when you step back, 
stop looking at the wires one by 
one, microscopically, and take a 
macroscopic view of the whole 
cage, that you can see why the 
bird does not go anywhere.... It is 
[then] perfectly obvious that the 
bird is surrounded by a network 
of systematically related barri
ers, no one of which would be the 
least hindrance to its flight, but 
which, by their relations to each 
other, are as confining as the solid 
walls of a dungeon.
The generic masculine is one of 
the wires.

Tartan Sports Editor
On a Saturday afternoon, the 
Carnegie Mellon Tartans football 
team answered the homecoming 
calls by defeating the University 
of Chicago Maroons by a score of 
55-12. Although the team 
dropped two games to two tough 
rivals, the University of Roches
ter and Allegheny College, they 
have come back to destroy Trin
ity University (TX) by a score of 
42-17 and then Chicago by the 
5512 margin.
The game opened up with the 
mighty Tartan defense stopping 
Chicago on their first drive. 
Chicagos punt was only an 18 
yarder, and the Tartans capital
ized on their excellent field posi
tion by scoring on a flee-flicker 
from standout sophomore run
ning back Jason Grusky to Block
buster Video Co-Player of the 
Game, junior fullback Brian 
Horton. The remainder of the first 
quarter was a defensive showing 
for the,Tartans, with Carnegie 
Mellon not allowing one first 
down. Chicagos punting was as 
horrendous as the rest of their 
team, averaging 19 yards in three 
punts. On the Tartan side, how
ever, the lacking was a different
story. Senior captain Matt Pielert 
was not even given a chance to 
punt, for the Tartans scored on 
two out of their first three drives, 
and then giving the ball over to 
the Maroons when their third 
drive failed.
Senior kicker Fred Hardings 
excellent leg was working well 
the entire game, making six ex
tra point conversions before al
lowing senior linebacker Jim 
Cooke to take the last one. 
Harding had a similarly produc
tive game last week in the defeat 
over Trinity University, continu
ing his excellent field goal and 
extra point percentage.
The second quarter was a bit of 
an improvement for Chicago, as 
they scored on their first drive. 
Maroons senior running back 
Frank 100 Yard Maker Baker 
scored on a three yard run. How
ever, the game was not as pro
ductive as that touchdown, as he 
did not live up to his nickname, 
rushing for only 66 yards and 
receiving for only six yards.
The entire Chicago team was 
stifled by the Tartans, only gain
ing 208 yards on the ground and 
44 in the air. The Tartans, how
ever, had 551 all-purpose yards, 
including an average of over five 
yards per play on the ground. The
Tartans did not let Bakers score 
get them upset, as they came 
back for two more scores (one by 
junior halfback Ed Ruland and 
one by the other Blockbuster 
Video Co-Player of the Game, 
outstanding sophomore quarter
back Chris Dee). The first half 
looked like somewhat of a massa
cre, with the Tartans picking up 
292 yards to the Maroons 120, 
and gaining fourteen first downs 
to the Maroons seven.
In the third quarter, the foot
ball team continued to please the 
crowd, scoring on a 28 yard pass 
from Dee to Horton on their open
ing drive. The Chicago offense 
continued to crumble, giving up a 
fumble and gaining only a single 
score. By the end of the third 
quarter, the CMU second team 
had looked as powerful as the 
first, with Carnegie Mellon lead
ing by the score of 3412.
In the fourth quarter, the Tar
tans did not stop their powerful 
attack, but rather continued their 
tremendous drives. Sophomore 
quarterback Matt Neiss contin
ued his excellent rushing, pick
ing up 64 yards on the ground in 
less than half the game. Fresh
man running back Robert Locke 
had an outstanding fourth quar
ter, picking up 22 yards on the
ground in only three attempts. 
Freshman halfback Mike Math
iasfourth quarter touchdown was 
his third of the year in only a 
third-string role. His performance 
showed how deep the Tartans are 
at each position.
Individually, the Tartans 
looked strong, with a powerful 
defensive squad. Linebacker 
Pielert had eight tackles, along 
with breaking up a pass. Sopho
more strong safety Steve 
Voytovich had a key pass 
breakup, and racked up three 
tackles. One of his tackles was an 
open field one that stopped Chi
cago from scoring. Cooke had two 
tackles, and an interception that 
led to a CMU score. Captain Andy 
Helms collected another inter
ception to get the ball away from 
Chicago, and Dave Andrews 
sacked Chicagos quarterback.
Offensively, many people con
tributed to the strong offensive 
attack. Although captain Griffin 
Peros ankle could not hold out 
for the game, Horton filled in 
very well. CMU did so well they 
shook the notion of being a 30 
minute team. The entire squad 
was pumped up, with everyone 
contributing to the game.
On Chicagos side, very little 
worked. Aside from an 11 yard
waggle play, the Maroon offense 
was virtually silenced. Their kick
ing situation was in shambles, 
with junior kicker JefTStolte quit
ting last week. Although Baker 
and senior tight end Joe Wagner 
tried to fit the bill, they were 
unsuccessful in their attempts. 
For a running team, they encoun
tered a great deal of trouble de
fending against the run. Mon
strous holes were available for 
Tartan running backs to run 
through. One of the best defen
sive plays was a controversial 
turnover by Tartans tight end 
Scott Peters. Although it looked 
like Chicago gained possession, 
the referees ruled that the balj 
was out of bounds before Chicago 
gained possession. As Chicagos 
head coach Grog Quick put it, 
Its tough to be competitive when 
you only have 50 [players] on the 
squad.
Although the Tartans playofj* 
hopes are very slim with Kochosr 
ter as University Athletic Asso
ciation champions already, the 
Tartans have not slowed their 
attack and are poised to try every 
avenue to make the season a good 
one, and hopefully, a playoffbound ono. They will next play on 
October 31 against Grove City 
(PA.) College at home.
failure faster than an epidemic. 
And as any given team acquires 
three or more ex-Cubs, the 
curse sets in, and they will not 
win the World Series.
Want proof? Since 1945,14 
teams have attempted to win 
the World Series with three or 
more ex-Cubs. Some, like the 
1953 Brooklyn Dodgers, were 
undeniably talented. Others 
were just Cinderella stories.
But in the end, they all choked. 
Remember the 78 Dodgers? 
They wallowed in defeat 
through most of the season, 
until general manager A1 
Campanis traded ex-Cub Mike 
Garman to Montreal, which 
successfully brought the ex-Cub 
count down to a benign two, 
and the Dodgers went on to 
achieve a winning season.
It didnt take long for the EXCUBS FACTOR to set in at 
Pittsburgh. The poor old Bucs 
didnt even make it to the 
Series. We should have known. 
Pittsburgh is the only con
tender with three ex-Cubs  
Lloyd McClendon, Gary Varsho, 
and Danny Jackson. That 
spelled doom. When that 
seventh game boiled down to 
the eighth inning, I was hoping 
Manager Jim Leyland would 
put away his cigarettes, go and 
get a gun, take Jackson quietly 
behind the bullpen, and shoot 
him. That would have given us 
two ex-Cubs, and we could have won.
- For now, I wag my fist in the 
air, as a sign of solidarity and 
ntempt, and shout Wait till 
ext year! as I grab a doughut and a Molson, and prepare 
sing O, Canada!

The Tartan mens soccer team 
won its third consecutive game 
and clinched its 12th consecutive 
winningseason under head coach 
Nick Gaudioso Saturday, but the 
biggest is yet to come. CMU, 9-3 
overall, and 2-2 in the UAA, will 
host a pair of nationally-ranked 
league opponents, Emory Uni
versity on Friday, and Washing
ton University on September 31.
Were playing much better as 
a team now  we're finishing 
much better, junior Min Chong 
said. With the UAA games [the 
next two weeks] were trying to 
get ready for them. The rest of 
the games are really hard, and 
we have to win almost all of them 
to get to the playoffs. If we win 
[against Emory and Washington] 
we have a pretty good chance to
make the playoffs. Thats our 
main goal  to make the play
offs. We have a winning season, 
but we cant be content with that."
The Tartans dropped a 2-0 
game to Forbes Avenue neighbor 
Pitt on October 7, taking a tough 
loss against a Division I foe.
They were really good, Chong 
said. It was a tough loss. It was 
a reality check for us, though, 
and itreally refocused ourgoals.
Since then, however, the Tar
tans reeled off a 2-0 shutout of 
Westminster College, as junior 
goalie Dave Shapiro set a new 
CMU record with his 21st career 
shutout and theTartans, who got 
a chance to rest a pair of injured 
players, senior Alan Horn and 
sophomore Vince Russell, got 
goals from senior Terence Sibiya 
and junior Mike Brazifiski. The 
team then crushed LaRoche Col
lege behind their biggest scoring
outputoftheseason,7-0,as seven 
different players scored goals. 
Chong, Brazinski, Sibiya, junior 
Basal Ramzy, sophomores Jeff 
McJunkin and Alex Amezquita, 
and. senior Rich Tesler scored to 
back Shapiro, who added to h?s 
shutout record, and his fellow 
goalies, junior Dan Warren and 
freshman John Moran.
TheTartans then stopped Penn 
State-Behrend College on Satur
day, 2-0, as Horn and sophomore 
Pat Lucignani tallied goals, once 
again supporting Shapiro.
With all the players healthy, 
and three straight wins unddr 
their belts, the Tartans are look
ing to finish the season in style 
and make the playoffs, facing 
Grove City College, Emory Uni
versity, New York University, 
Bethany College next, and then 
ending the season with Washing
ton University.

Langer and Baustert 
lead cross country
The mens and womens cross 
country teams have been doing 
very well this season, and showed 
off their talent by taking third 
place in the Pittsburgh All-City 
Meet last weekend at Schenley 
Park. The University of Pitts
burgh won the meet, followed by 
Duquesne. Robert Morris College 
finished fourth in both races. The 
mens course was 8000 meters, 
and Tartans standout Jim 
Langer took sixth place overall. 
His time of 25:45 was a seasonbest for Langer, a two-time UAA 
Athlete of the Week. In the 
womens race, Melissa Baustert 
took fourth overall with her sea
son-high 19:51 in the 3.1 mile 
course. This Saturday, both teams 
will compete in the University 
Athletic Association Champion
ship at Case Western Reserve 
University in Cleveland. Langer 
hopes to improve his 10th place 
finish and second team All-UAA 
selection from last year. Joining 
Langer on the mens squad will 
be Rich Hayes, Scott Phillips, 
Mike Rea, Matt Beam, Scott Perfater, and Kevin Pogany, while 
Aliza Hildebrand, Colleen Bark
ley, Karen Bryla, and Christa 
Sober will join Baustert on the 
womens squad.

Womens soccer 
rebounds
The womens soccer team has 
rebounded from a mediocre start 
to do well, posting a 5-81 record 
and going undefeated in their last 
four games. On October 6, they 
beat Washington and Jefferson 
3-0, and then came back to beat 
Waynesburg 1-0 on October 10. 
In the Washington and Jefferson 
game, Christina Isaly, Erika 
Banuellos, and Julie Paul all 
scored goals, while Tracy Howard 
had an assist. In the Waynesburg 
game, the lone goal was scored by 
Sonya Chmielnicki. On Friday, 
October 16, they tied Slippery 
Rock 0-0, and then on Sunday, 
they beat Hiram College 2-0. In 
the Hiram game, Sara Hayutin 
and Isaly scored goals, while 
Rachel Bourn had an assist. Trish 
Henrich now has four and a half 
shutouts, three of which have 
come in recent action. Coach Julie 
Shackford feels that the team is 
now winning because, The last 
part of our schedule is much 
easier, and we are playing a lot 
better, too. She feels that the 
team did very well against topranked Rochester, and many of 
the shots were close to going in 
the goal. Her predictions about 
doing well this past weekend were 
correct, as they went 1-0-1. The
team is showing a great deal of 
poise and talent, and should be a 
force to reckon with in the future.
Hockey club 
poised and ready
Snow isnt quite falling yet, and. 
the National Hockey League only 
started a couple weeks ago, but 
the Carnegie Mellon Hockey Club 
will be taking the ice for the first 
time this season Friday night, 
after taking the West Penn Col
lege Hockey League champion
ship last year. The hockey team 
will get the season rolling with 
an exhibition game in Kittaning 
against cross-town rival and Di
vision II team Duquesne.
After winning the league cham
pionship last year behind strong 
leadership and good defense, the 
team is hoping to repeat this year. 
The team lost some players to 
graduation, but feel they can work 
past the losses and continue to 
play strongly in the league.
With a schedule that includes 
tough rivals like the University 
of Pittsburgh and Slippery Rock 
University, Carnegie Mellon has 
a hard road ahead in competition 
for the league championship.

PRINCIPLES of SOUND RETIREMENT INVESTING
IF YOU THOUGHT COLLEGE WAS 
EXPENSIVE, TRY PUTTING YOURSELF 
THROUGH RETIREMENT.
T
hink about supporting yourself for 
twenty-five, thirt3'years or longer 
in retirement. It might be the greatest 
financial test youll ever face. Fortunately, 
you have one valuable asset in your 
favor. Time.
Time to take advantage of tax-deferral. 
Time for your money to grow.
But starting early is key. Consider this: 
ifyou begin saving just $100 a month at 
age thirty, you can accumulate $192,539* 
by the time you reach age sixty-five.
Wait ten years and you'd need to set aside 
$227 a month to reach the same goal.
At TIAA-CREF] we not only under
stand the value of starting early, we 
can help make it possiblewith flexible 
retirement and tax-deferred annuity 
plans, a diverse portfolio of investment 
choices, and a record of personal 
service that spans 75years.

On October 8, the volleyball 
team defeated Bethany College
3-2. CMU swept the season se
ries against the Bisons and raised 
its overall record to 1611.
The match was a see-saw battle 
characterized by momentum 
swings, scoring streaks, unforced 
errors, and flawless execution.
CMU won the opening game 
15-7 behind the precision serv
ing of junior Jennifer New. After 
falling behind 7-4, New led the 
team withll straightpoints. We 
stayed strong and took advan
tage of them when they started to 
break down, said New. They 
started losing point after point.
The Tartans couldnt get it 
started in the second game, com
mitting a number of unforced er
rors, and lost 1511.
CMU quickly jumped out to a 
6-1 lead in game three with se
nior Heather Thompson serving.
Bethany bounced back big, scoringthe next 12 points before CMU 
finally took control to win 16-14.
Game four went to Bethany 15-
12 forcing a decisive fifth game.
The teams kept trading the lead 
and momentum makingit stress
ful for both the players and 
coaches, as well as the specta
tors. The Tartans prevailed, scor
ing the final four points to win 
15-13.
Head coach Susan McDonald 
was pleased with the teams per
formance. In the match tonight 
our defense was very strong, pass
ing was very good, and the of
fense played veiy well. Sometimes 
we have a lapse in our intensity 
but the girls are working hard on 
it every time we play.
The team was led by the setting 
of senior Lisa Devlin, who had 41 
assists. Senior Lisa Leonardo, a 
first team all-UAA selection last 
fall, had 17 kills and several key 
blocks. Another senior, Ann Feng, 
led the defense with 14 digs.

By JOSH LINDER
Tartan Sports Editor
On Saturday, October 18, the 
Carnegie Mellon Football Hall of 
Fame was dedicated to the 
memory of Carnegie Tech foot
ball player Howard Harpster, the 
greatest Tartan football player 
ever. He graduated in 1930 with 
a bachelor's degree in architec
ture. He then went on to coach 
football at Shady side Academy,
Geneva College, and Carnegie 
Tech from 1933-1936.-
Harpster, from Akron, Ohio, 
was an instrumental player on 
the Carnegie Tech teams of the 
late 1920s. He was a widely used 
player, playing quarterback, de
fensive back, punter, placekicker, and kick returner. He 
started in three out of the four 
years he played at Carnegie Tech, 
leading the team to a 19-7-1 
record, including wins over such 
powerhouses as the University of 
Notre Dame, University of Pitts
burgh, and West Virginia Uni
versity. In 1926, the Tartans were 
the victors in the greatest tri
umph of their 84 year history, 
defeating Notre Dame by the Pekor at x5139.
score of 19-0 in front of 35,000 
fans. Harpster, who was said to 
be a player with the mind of a 
coach, led the Tartans to the 
victory with two field goals - one 
for 32 yards and one for 45. In 
that season, they went 7-2 with 
shutouts in all seven of their wins. 
He also led Carnegie Tech to a 
27-7 victory over Notre Dame at 
their home field in 1928, the first 
loss for the Irish in 23 years.
Harpster was named to Knute 
Rockne's All-America Team in 
1928 and was inducted into the 
National Football Hall of Fame 
at the football game against 
Dickinson College on October 13, 
1966. In 1980, Harpster died at 
the age of 73.
The Howard Harpster Football 
Hall of Fame is located in the 
tunnel between the Gestling Sta
dium field and the athletic facil
ity under West Wing / Resnik 
Hall. The Hall of Fame will be 
open during the day, and includes 
memorabilia from Carnegie Mel

teams. Formore information, con

Ive been wondering lately how 
Neon Deion Sanders does it. 
One day, hes playing baseball in 
Pittsburgh against the Pirates, 
then, just a few hours later, hes 
catching passes and playing 
tough defense against one of the 
best wide receivers in the Na
tional League. Football league, 
that is. And when he arrived in 
Miami, Atlanta coach Jerry 
Glanville took advantage of him. 
Sanders didnt return any kick| offs or punts, as he normally 
wight, but he did play defense 
against Miami receiver Mark 
Clayton, and even came in on 
: offense a few times to play receiver. All that and hes on the 
National League championship 
| team two years in a row.
But of course anyone who has 
international shoe manufactur
ers paying for every breath he 
takes while running back and 
forth between sports deserves to 
e insulted, not hailed. Would 
Sanders even try to play the two 
I sPorts if it werent for the inordi
nate amount of money he gets 
Paid by both of teams he plays 
| or? I hear he loves himself, but 
that just isnt indicative of someng a guy who loves himself 
would do. Perhaps he loves both 
sports so much, he feels best when 
Playing both of them.
Then I remember a clip I saw 
about him while he was still at
tending Florida State. It showed 
him covered in gold jewelry and a 
beautiful red sports car, the ex
act style of which I cant seem to 
remember. As a college star, the 
man was raking in the bucks.I 
cant help but feel that thats all 
hes doing for the owners of 
Atlantas baseball and football 
teams. Of course, lets not forget 
that while he trades sports, a 
certain, nameless shoe company, 
whose specialtieslatelyhavebeen 
David Robinson, Michael Jordan, 
and Bo Jackson, pays every penny 
of his travel. Nice guys. (And I 
happen to like their shoes, too.) 
But, I cant condone their behav
ior. But no one asked me anyway. 
I suppose in a capitalist society 
every one is allowed a fair chance 
at the wealth. It just kinda dis
gusts me when people get away 
with working the sports world 
over so well. At least he plays, 
and well, I should add.
Last weekend, I watched part 
of the Kansas City-Philadelphia 
matchup. Kansas City won, and 
Ill add arrogantly, I predicted 
the victory. I predicted the win 
without prior knowledge of what 
Philly did to Dallas the Monday 
prior, I predicted the win without 
even realizing who KC.s quar
terback was these days. When I 
saw the name Krieg across the 
shoulders of the Chiefs quarter
backs jersey, I was dumbstruck.
I knew that Steve DeBerg had 
been benched, I knew Seattle 
didnt have Dave Krieg running 
the ineffective offense. I didnt 
know that the Chiefs were pay
ing the quarterback with one of 
the most infamous talents of all
time: Dave Krieg drops the ball 
at buzz of a housefly. Normally, 
anyway.
Philadelphia didnt make him 
drop the ball. No one did. And he 
didnt even elect to do it himself. 
He didnt fumble. I havent 
watched him play in quite some 
time, but he was the only player 
Ive ever seen to fumble five or six 
games in a row that I happened 
to watch. (That may exclude 
former Steelers running back 
Tim Worley, who Im pretty sure 
fumbled in more than half of the 
games my freshperson year.) I 
cant see how Krieg, who never 
led the Seahawks out of their 
dismal Seattle setting into some
thing bigger than a wildcard play
off, is supposed to lead the Chiefs 
any further than theyve already 
been under DeBerg. But, mine is 
not to question, rather to watch 
and pray, as I am a Chiefs fan.
Speaking of the Chiefs, theyll 
be hosting the Steelers Sunday. 
The Steelers have struggled of 
late, while the Chiefs have 
dropped only two games with a 
point spread of four points, with 
one of the games ending in over
time. I take the Chiefs, theyre a 
stronger, better team than the 
Steelers right now. Cincinnati, 
two weeks after their shootout 
with Houston, will be playing 
Houston again on Sunday, this 
time in the Astrodome. Take 
Houston easily.
Cleveland behind Mike 
Tomczak works a lot better than 
the Kosar Browns. Either way, 
they should beat New England 
easily. Denver should have an 
easy time with the Chargers. 
Miami will be taking on the Colts. 
Not a fun game to watch, unless
youre a Dolphins fan, and you 
like watching boring games where 
one team dominates everything. 
Dallas and the Raiders pair off in 
an interesting game. Take the 
Cowboys, theyre heading to the 
playoffs again. Seattle will lose 
another one, this time to the Gi
ants. Chicago should beat Green 
Bay fairly easily. Detroit over 
Tampa. Washington over Minne
sota in an interesting matchup. 
The Vikings have been playing 
better than expected, the Red
skins worse. Take Philly over 
Phoenix to end the weekend.
This weekend, if you take in 
any NFL action, stop and think 
about how all those guys are get
ting paid to have fun on a football 
field. And we have sit at home 
and watch and wear our tennis 
shoes, working our rear-ends off 
so we can have a decent-paying 
job that well probably dislike. 
Oh, capitalism.

Theres something magical about campus on Homecoming 
weekend. Maybe its that we see CMU through the eyes of our 
alumni, some of whom havent been back in 50 years. Maybe 
its the memories that were built this weekend at the reunions, 
the dance, and the winning football game.
Or maybe its just the air of expectancy, when everything on 
campus is polished for visitors and gleams just a little brighter 
than usual.
Says Associate Director of Alumni Relations and homecom
ing organizer Tammy Hale, Overall, there were some 33 
different events. There were 
social events so [that] people
could renew--------------------
old friend
ships, and 
also educa
tional ones."
A wide vari
ety of events 
was planned 
for both Fri
day and Sat
urday nights, 
including the 
Golden 50th 
anniversary 
reunion and 
an evening of
music Fi-iday --------------------
at the Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland.
Alumni could also attend de
partment receptions and cam
pus tours through their old 
colleges.
President Mehrabian gave a 
state ofthe University address 
Saturday morning after the 
Deans breakfast.
The Kiltie Band performed a 
short concert before the foot
ball game, and at half-time, 
Albert C. May, class of 1921, 
1992 (honorary), and now an 
honorary member of the class 
of 1993 and founder of the 
Alumni Association, made the
"I really appreciate what your 
president is saying in terms of 
undergraduate education.... I 
will definitely be coming back 
for another Homecoming to see 
what happens next.
 John " Jack  Boone 
Physics, 1937
The Kiltie Band marches to the football game to cheer the team on to Its overwhelming 55-12 victory over the University of Chicago.
Albert C. May society dedication a little more meaning
ful with his presence.
As for food, there were many opportunities to take 
advantage of Dining Service and Caterings better-thanusual fare. Alumni luncheons, a traditional dinner in 
Skibo Ballroom, and SundayB champagne brunch for 
alumni were all included.
On Saturday, Dining Service served a free lunch on 
the Cut for everyone on campus. On Friday night SDC 
sponsored a Candlelight Dinner for students.
The Homecoming danco, hold on one of the Station 
Square clipporships, "was basically orientation over 
again, excopt nicer, says Matt Cline, a froshman chemi
cal engineering major.
Students wont in a broad spectrum of dross from vory
casual to 
formal, 
but ovoryone went 
according 
to their 
own stylo, 
saidH&SS 
frOBhman 
Magda 
Strogus. 
There was 
a wide va
riety of 
good dance 
music se-------------------------------------------------------------lected by
the DJ.
Most people had a good time at the dance and, on the 
whole, they didnt mind the five-hour length at all.
Although the dance was attended mostly by current 
students, the spotlight of the weekend was still fixed on 
the alumni.
One alumnus, John Jack Boone (Physics, 1937), 
commented on how organized the Homecoming events 
were this year and how helpful the Btudents made 
themselves.
As a physics major, he was one of only nine students 
with that major in a graduating class of about 300. About 
graduating in the midst of the Great Depression, ho 
says, I was one of the lucky oneB who got a job right out 
of school at an optical company.
After later spending 26 years at IBM, Boone is now 
retired and has three children and nine grandchildren. 
To get through school, Boone worked as a waiter at a 
restaurant nicknamed The 
Beanery, and as a soda jerk at a 
drugstore.
When asked what people did for 
fun in the 1930s, he said, (We] 
danced, primarily. At that point in 
time, there were a number of parks 
in the area, and every Saturday 
night, a big band would play and 
wed dance.
Football games were also big with 
the students, as was Spring Carni
val. CMU was a big time football 
contender back then.
We beat Notre Dame and Pitt a 
couple of times while I was in school, 
and the year after I graduated, we 
played in the Cherry Bowl, says 
Boone.
What impressed Boone most in 
returning to campus for his 55th 
class reunion was the number of 
positive changes in the 
administrations views, the num
ber of new buildings on campus, 
and the tremendous growth in cam
pus population.
When I was hero I took a biology 
course and I was the only boy in the 
class  it was fun, says Boone.
Boone was especially impressed 
by President Mehrabians state of 
the University speech on Saturday. 
I really appreciate what your presi
dent is saying in terms of under
graduate education. It needs a 
broader view, said Boone.
I will definitely be coming back 
for another Homecomingto see what 
minenams/1 arcanrnoiogr^pner happens next he said.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 October 1992
Intl Festival offers improved, diverse activity
esQ".5ysyaud mldyn .a du4nyauE KlA40ur d4IIyduH.ad
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Carnegie Mellons second annual International Festival, focusing 
qn Latin America and the Caribbean, begins this Wednesday at 4 
pm.
From Washington High Schools 22-student steel drum band 
performance at the opening ceremonies, to the 
salsa band GuarachaPs dance on Saturday night, 
the festival is full of just about everything. Theres 
something for everyone, from piata making to 
rumba lessons.
The decision to focus on Latin America and the 
Caribbean in this years festival was influenced by 
the 500th anniversary of Columbus landing in the 
Americas.
There have also been several changes in the 
format of the festival since last year. We got some 
really good feedback from last years question
naires, says Festival Coordinator Aliya Khan.
We have more visual aids and fewer lectures 
than last year, she says, and most events are 
after 4 pm so that students and faculty can go after 
classes. All of these are suggestions from people.
Theres also more student and faculty involve
ment, including a student coordinator, sophomore 
art major Kelly Walter, and a faculty adviser, 
history professor Erick Langer. Walter, with the 
help of sophomore design major Brett Snyder, 
created a design package for festival publicity, 
including pencils, balloons, T-shirts and banners.
Walter alBO organized two student committees 
to help with the festival. I thought it was very 
important that we had students involved with the 
festival, says Walter.
Langer, who teaches several courses in Latin 
American history, helped Khan find lecturers and 
musical groups in the area. He will also lead a 
presentation based on his travels in the Gran 
Chaco Desert. I wanted to give Latin America a 
higher profile on campus, says Langer.
The four-day schedule is chock full of art, cos
tume, dance, food, games, lectures, music, and 
^Personal Journeys  which Khan explains as informal talks on 
whatever [the speakers] choose. (There are 17 in all.)
There are two keynote speakers as well. The first is Dr. Joao 
Clemente Baena Soares, the Secretary General of the Organization 
of American States, who will speak Wednesday evening following 
the opening ceremonies.
Baena Soares has been a Brazilian ambassador to the United 
Nations as well as several other countries. He has also been recog
nized with over SO awards from dozens of countries. Langer is 
hosting this speaker.
The second keynote speaker, Dr. Juan Sosa, has been a Panama
nian ambassador and is an authority on Latin America public,
foreign, and economic policy. Dr. Sosas lecture will take place on 
Friday evening.
Dance and music presentations are liberally sprinkled throughout 
the entire International Festival. Wednesdays performance by the 
Venezuelan ensemble Odila is an exhibit of the musical talent of 
eight members who play over 300 Latin American and Caribbean 
instruments.
AB Concerts hosts the calypso band Dr. Kwasi and the Islanders 
on Friday evening in the Tent. The all-day Celebracin! music and 
dance fair on Saturday includes five bands and a variety of instru
mental, vocal, and dance troupe talents. Saturday is also the Festival 
Musical, showcasing song and dance from several Latin American 
and Caribbean countries.
Saturday afternoons Latin dance lessons, hosted by the CMU 
Ballroom Dance Club, teach the rumba, samba, meringue, and salsa 
just in time for the festivals final performance of the salsa band 
Guaracha! on Saturday night.
Art abounds during the festival as well. The Arts and Crafts Fair 
will be held Thursday through Saturday, where all sorts of Latin
American and Caribbean arts, crafts, jewelry and clothing will be 
on display, for purchase or just window shopping. Pinaia-making 
demonstrations will take place on Wednesday and Saturday, and a 
piata contest will be held on Saturday afternoon between frater
nities, sororities and student organizations.
The parade of traditional costumes on Saturday evening will 
display exotic costumes from the regions represented in the festi
val.
And for food-lovers, 
there will be food ev
erywhere. In addition 
to the refreshments 
served at all major 
events, there are sev
eral programs dedi
cated solely to the cui
sine of the region.
The International 
Coffee Hour offers in
ternational desserts 
and coffees as well as 
guitar music on 
Wednesday evening. 
Saturdays wine-tasting(by invitation only, 
kids) in Scotland Yard 
invites one to enjoy 
wines from Argentina, 
Chil, and Brazil.
The Food Fair runs 
from noon-6 pm on 
Saturday, and will fea
ture dishes from 10 or
11 countries which 
will be prepared by 
local restaurants and 
community members.
Another of the 
festivals biggest at
tractions is
Thursdays Informa
tion Fair. Each coun
try represented in the
festival (some islands are combined) will have a table displaying 
pamphlets, periodicals, books, posters, artifacts, and even recipes 
from the country.
Its a hands-on experience, says Walter, who organized much of 
the Information Fair. Its a slice of each countrys culture.
Khan is excited about the festival, she says, because the festival 
is much better planned this year. Last year it was sort of a last 
minute thing. This year weve been working a lot longer.
Says Walter of the festival, Im really interested in what effect 
the festival will have.... I think it can only get better each year."
Im looking forward to seeing everybody elses contributions, 
says Langer. Theres a tremendous variety of thingsIll be busy.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 October 1992L3
Alumni in Europe offer advice for students
gy LAUREN E. HEINZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Perhaps one of the best ways to im
prove your education is to seek advice 
from the pros, those with experience and 
know-how  maybe alumni. Stephanie 
Horwitz, a senior IM major, recently 
had the opportunity to travel indepen
dently through Western Europe, through 
a program she proposed and designed 
herself to interview alumni who now 
reside in Europe.
Not only did she gain much from the 
experience, but she returned to school 
with insights of how past students have 
used their CMU education, as well as 
advice for current students.
Horwitz, president of the Student 
Alumni Relations Council (SARC), de
veloped the idea for the project last year. 
I blended the ideas of wanting to go to 
Europe in combination with my involve
ment in SARC. I wanted to know what 
their [the alumnis] needs were, she 
: says.
She approached several administra
tors, and they together searched for fund
ing and approval. Once the funding was 
found, Horwitz immediately started heri
work, sending letters to 110 alumni in 
Western Europe. Once she received re
plies and set schedules for interviews, 
she had a list of 45 alumni who were 
willing to participate. In all, the journey 
would cover eight countries in Western 
Europe and would take two months.
Carnegie Mellon itself has many in
ternational interests. With a new office 
openingin Japan, the International Fes
tival, and the many ethnic interest 
groups on campus, the school is obvi
ously expanding its borders. The school 
is looking to go global, says Horwitz. 
The alumni are an integral part of our 
understanding of [international] affairs.
Horwitz flew off to Europe in June. 
Her first stop was Britain where she had 
many discussions and met many inter
esting and diverse people.
Although her interviews were con
ducted in order to hear their feedback 
and concerns with CMU relations, many 
alumni willingly offered advice for cur
rent students.
One such alumnus, Bruce Cohan, a 
1975 architecture and civil engineering 
graduate currently living and working 
in London, had a few words of counsel. 
He says, If you get a job in another 
country: learn the language. Assume 
that you have at least a six-month ad
justment period to get used to the cul
ture, and make an effort to meet the 
natives.
Other alumni from Britain such as 
Ambar Paul (IM, 79 and LA, 82) and 
David Harland (GSIA 70) had points to 
make about majors and degrees. The 
combination of a bachelors degree in 
engineering and a masters degree in 
business provides you with a good scope. 
Try to get foreign work experience, says 
Harland. Paul suggests getting a gradu
ate degree as a value marker. He does 
not believe having an undergraduate 
degree is enough.
Other alumni had longer-lasting sug
gestions. Get experience early in your 
career and dont be afraid to do some
thing you enjoy because after a while it 
is hard to break out of a career track, 
says Jean Pelligrini (MCS 80) of Lon
don.
courtesy Stephanie Horwitz
Alumni now residing in the Netherlands gathered to talk with Horwitz. From left, Nancy Schrlner-Novlck (A 74), Tim Killiam (A 
72), Rosa Silver (A 86), John Ricker (A 73), Bernice Lehman (A), and R. J. Meuter (IA 74).
Bob Steinmetz (GSIA 86) of Brussels, 
agrees. Look for a job in a field that you 
like and then pick the company you like 
within that field. Dont work for a com
pany which is in a field that doesnt 
excite you, he says.
On one occasion, Horwitz had the op
portunity to speak with three other 
alumni living in Britain  Peter Wil
liams, Mike Hawkins, and George 
Greenham (all PFE, '89), who currently 
work for British Airways. The trio of
fered the following advice. If you cant 
find a job immediately, stay at the Uni
versity longer as a safeguard. Be sensi
tive to what is going on around you  
know what is happening in the news so 
you dont appear ignorant in interviews. 
Learning and knowing the language 
was a fairly consistent suggestion across 
the board. Many recommend taking an 
introductory courso in the later years of 
school, or according to Glenn Jones, 
(GSIA 61) who livos in Madrid, Learn 
three languages fluontlyl
Horwitz herself wns struck by the 
number of alumni who spoke at loast 
three languages and the fair amount 
who were fluent in four or five. I was 
really amazed. In fact, it mado mo won
der if I needed to readjust my own edu
cation, she says.
The advice goes on and on, but some 
are quite personal and motivational. As 
Jaques Chanine, (CivE 86) of Paris, put 
simply, Daro to disturb tho universe. 
It seems Horwitz hersolf must have 
taken some of this to heart considering 
her vigor and ambition in dosigning such 
an arduous project. Something like this 
project can bo done at this school, aho 
says. Dovolop your ideas  maybe it 
can bo dono. There is no limit to tho 
opportunities that are availablo as long 
as you havo tho drivo.
Studying abroad takes 
effort, but worth it
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Features Editor
;; Study abroad is a phrase that 
brings to mind lots of colorful, 
beautiful images  reading 
Baudelaire on the French coun
tryside, studying architecture in 
an environment where traditional 
Japanese pagodas and modem 
buildings stand side by side, 
speaking Spanish in Spain. No 
matter how far away all of this 
may seem, these kinds of images 
can become reality with a little 
careful orchestration.
To get everything started, study 
abroad advisor Emily Bianchini 
recommends a meeting with her 
to discuss options. There are ba
sically two major categories of 
programsCMU-sponsored and 
non-CMU-sponsored.
CMU-sponsored programs re
quire the least amount of actual 
legwork, since the University al
ready knows about course offer
ings and such. The three CMUsponsored programs are the Keio 
University exchange program in 
Japan, the EPFL (Ecole Poly
technique Federate de Lausanne, 
or Federal Technical School of 
Lausanne) program in Switzer
land, and the Carnegie Mellon 
Centre de Tours in Tours, France. 
Says Bianchini, The CMU pro
grams are the easiest to deal with 
like in Tours you get to keep all 
of your financial aid except work 
study. Ill probably recommend 
one ofthese programs to you first.
However, if none of these pro
grams seem to fit the bill, 
Bianchini will help the student, 
choose another. We usually try 
to recommend programs that 
weve dealt with before, so we all
know what youre getting into, 
she says. But there are hundreds 
of programs to choose from, in
dexed by country and course of 
study.
Students must also meet with 
their advisors very soon after de
ciding to go abroad, because aca
demic requirements must still be 
fulfilled, and advisors can offer 
insight and advice on how to get 
everything done.
After the student picks a pro
gram, he or she must apply to it. 
Bianchini has application forms 
for many programs, but the stu
dent may have to contact the head 
of the program itself for applica
tion materials.
According to Bianchini, appli
cations normally consist of es
says, letters of recommendation, 
and transcripts. She also says that 
it is a good idea to send out appli
cations for passports and student 
visas no later than this time, as
well.
Most programs notify students 
as to whether or not they are 
accepted within a month of the 
application deadline. If the stu
dent is accepted, he or she must 
then register for classes.
If the student is going to Tours, 
he or she can register on a normal 
Registration/Add/Drop form. Stu
dents going anywhere else must 
fill out the Study Abroad Trans
fer Credit form with their aca
demic advisors and obtain the 
necessary signatures.
The key is basically staying in 
touch with me, and keeping on 
top of things, says Bianchini.
She coordinates much of the 
registration and application pa
perwork for students, and as long 
as they know whats going on, 
everything should run smoothly.
Bianchini also recommends 
that students wishing to go

LAThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 October 1992
CMU alumna lights up the Metropolitan Opera
By RUTH RASMUSSEN
Tartan Asst. Forum Editor
Barely two years out of college, 
Heidi Skok (Music, 90) has 
reached a stage in her field that 
many artists can only dream of. 
She has garnered critical acclaim 
from such publications as the 
Washington Post and has won 
herself a position in the presti
gious Young Artists Program at 
theMetropolitan Opera Company 
in New York City.
, She started her career as a cho
rus member in the Pittsburgh
Opera production of Madame 
Butterfly during her junior year 
at CMU and, soon after, she be
came a member of the Pittsburgh 
Opera Companys Young Artists 
Program, as well as the opera 
program at Duquesne University.
At 22, her career expanded 
when Eugene Kohn, Plcido 
Domingos conductor, toured 
through Pittsburgh in March, 
1991 and coached the Company.
According to Skok, He said, 
You know, I have an agent with 
Columbia Artists Management 
in New York that I would like to
have you sing with,... Three 
weeks later I went to sing, and 
they said, We really like your 
talent, but you are a little young. 
... Three days later the agent 
called and said, The Met has 
heard about you and would like 
to hear you, wouldyoucome back? 
I flew back and sang for Gail 
Robinson, who is the director of 
the [Young Artists] Program, and 
she said, You are going to have to 
sing for Jimmy Levine right 
away, so I was like, *0h my gosh, 
so I went on stage and sang three 
arias for Levine.... I left, and 20
minutes later, they said, How

Skok is currently a principal in 
the Pittsburgh Opera, as well as 
the Young Artists Program with 
the Met in New York. She de
buted at Carnegie Hall as a solo
ist in the Faure Requiem, and has 
guested at the Wolftrap Summer 
Festival.
She won the 1991 Opera 
America Grant, and in both 1989 
and 1990 she won the Metropoli
tan Opera National Council Au
ditions in Pittsburgh.
Considering her extraordinarilyrapidrise andcritical acclaim, 
she is refreshingly modest. I feel 
very fortunate, she says. Ev
erywhere that I go, I am called 
Tdddo and babe of the cast so I 
guess that I am the baby in the 
company in terms of years. 
When asked why she chose op
era over musical theater, she said 
that it was the poetry and 
subtlety of the music that at
tracted her. She agrees with her 
director at the Pittsburgh Opera 
who says that opera is larger 
than life.
She says the formal education 
she received at CMU helps be
cause Music is our life, [but] there 
is a world around us that we 
bring into our music.
All of her work has certainly 
paid off. Sitting through practice, 
I watched her perform her solo in 
Act III oiCarmen. She sings beau
tifully  her performance elic
ited applause even from her peers.
She leaves a message to other 
artists: I wish that all the kids at 
CMU, people who are trying to 
make it in this business, keep on 
plugging. Its a lot of fun.
If you smoke 4,000hours a year, stopping for 24 wont kill you.
In fact, it might save your life. All you have to do is join 
millions of other Americans and give up smoking for a day. 
Because if you can quit for a day, you can quit for life.

Start planning now 
to study abroad
STUDY ABROAD, from page L3
abroad make plans for their semester of 
return so that they are not forced to 
register for classes at the last minute.
Plan for it, Bianchini says. If you 
really want to do this, youve got to plan
 save some electives, that kind of 
thing.
This may seem like quite a long, in
volved process, and it does require some 
work, but the benefits surely outweigh 
any inconvenience.
There are so many benefits to travel
ling and living abroad  youre im
mersed in another culture for a semes
ter, or a year, and you begin to under
stand how that culture works, says 
Bianchini.
It really makes you more tolerant, 
and more able to face things that you 
may not understand, she says.
Senior civil engineering and EPP ma
jor Peter Dautermann agrees. Dautermann, who spent a year in Switzer
land as part of the EPFL program, says, 
It was neat for me just to see a different 
culture for a year. It really makes you 
understand and question yourself, your 
values and attitudes.
And, of course, learning a different
language is another big benefit. If 
youre going to study abroad, take the 
challenge of jumping in with both feet 
and studying a different language, says 
Dautermann. Its hard, but definitely 
worth it.
Another benefit of studying abroad is 
simply the experience of being on ones 
own. Bianchini says, When I went 
abroad, I went by myself, and I realized 
I could do it, and that it wasnt that sca
ry. I was able to do it.
Its the first step, really, in jumping 
into whatever you want to do. Instead 
of thinking maybe this will work you 
think I can do this....
And you can go abroad now, she 
says. Once you go to work, you may not 
get the chance to do it. You wont get 
enough vacation time to live there, and 
going like a tourist isnt the same. 
Just thinking about studying abroad 
and actually doing it are two very dif
ferent things, but planning the process 
and staying on top of all the paperwork 
are the best way s to guarantee that you 
will indeed have that croissant at a 
sidewalk caf next fall. All of this may 
seem like a crazy amount of work, but 
the rewards are surely worth it.

Angert and Lemme had a very conversational tone, making me believe that they were comfortable in their roles, and with each other.Humor came mainly in the form of the confrontations between Bindermeyer and the two supernatural beings in the diner, which benefitted most from the humorous overacting

that bind her. Carmen escapes and Don Jose is besotted and arrested.Act I is incredible, with the strong voices melding beautifully in the duets and choral work. The fight scene in the factory is especially memorable. It is here that we are introduced to Carmens ability to manipulate mens passions and desires, the theme of passion overriding sense in Don Jose, and the true love of Micaela.In Act II, Carmen is with her two gypsy friends, Frasuita (MarjorieMcClean) and Mercedes (Camille Gifford), who continues to sing memorable duets together. They want Carmen to join them in helping the smugglers Dancairom and Remendado in a new smuggling plan. Carmen refuses unless Don Jose comes with them.Don Jose arrives and Carmen tries to charm him into going. He refuses, citing a committment to gobacktocamp. Furious, Carmen demands that they run off together. He refuses, but pulls a knife in a rage when his captain mocks his choice of Carmen over Micaela. With this act of agression, Don Jose cannot go back to camp and must escape with Carmen and her friends.In the mountains, Don Jose professes regrets about not making good on his commitments at home, which only elicits taunts

Viridiana
This 1961 Spanish film tells the story of the 
innocent young girl named Viridiana. Prior to tak
ing her vows to become a nun, she is forced by 
Mother Superior to visit her wealthy, sex-obsessed 
uncle. He corrupts her, introducing her to his sor
did life of materialism and frustrated sexuality.
Viridiana has been called a devastating, outra
geous critique of religion and society. Much to the 
dismay of the Catholic church, it won a Palme dOr 
at the Cannes Film Festival.
It is directed by Luis Buuel, who was praised by 
Leonard Maltin, saying of him: Near perfect direc
tion by a master filmmaker. Maltin also ap
plauded solid performances by all, and gave the 
film 3 1/2 (out of four) stars.
Viridiana stars Silvia Pinal, who plays the title 
role. Also featured are Fransisco Rabal, Fernando 
Rey, and Margarita Lozano.
This movie is in Spanish with English subtitles, 
so unless you happen to be fluent come prepared to 
read.
At 6, 8,10 pm.

High Heels
High Heels is a racy comedy about the bizarre 
relationship between a TV newscaster and her 
mother. The man they both call their lover is mur
dered, making them both suspects in the murder. 
Their reaction to all of this ultimately, humorously, 
and touchingly brings them together and they all 
live happily ever after.
This movie was made in 1991 and directed by 
Pedro Almodovar, who also directed Tie Me Up, Tie 
Me Down.
If youve ever been a TV newswoman or had a 
bizarre relationship with your mother, you will 
probably love this movie to death.
Many times it has been the case that such 
relationships jump the bounds of time, space, and 
cultural differences.
That is to say, that just because this is a foreign 
film, that does not mean that you will not relate 
very well to sharing a sex partner with one of your 
parental units, which, of course, is a lot better than 
being the sexual partner of a parental unit, which 
is an entirely different movie all-together.
At 6, 8,10 pm, midnight.

Housesitter
Starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, 
Housesitter is a smash-hit comedy that tells the 
tale of an architect who builds his dream house 
with the idea of moving in with his girlfriend and 
hopeful wife-to-be. She, after seeing the house, 
freaks out and dumps him.
Along comes Hawn, who plays a compulsive liar. 
She meets Martin, learns about his house and 
decides to move in, without his knowledge. She 
occupies the house, fills it with furniture bought on 
his credit, and tells all the locals (including his 
parents) that she is his recently married wife, 
although they barely know each other, and he is 
still unaware of any of this.
He plays along for awhile, trying to win back his 
girlfriend. In the end, they all live happily ever 
after, although Im not gonna tell you how, but Im 
sure you can guess.
Housesitter is a great film! I loved it! It was 
better than Cats. Im going to see it again and 
again.

Suspense sweetens the plot of Candyman
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Forum Editor
Candyman is Clive Barkers latest foray into film, this time as the executive producer (the screenplay is written and directed by Bernard Rose).For those of you who dont recognize either of the names, Barker was the director and writer ofHellraiser and NightBreed and the executive producer of Hellhound: Hellraiser 
2. Candyman is a movie adaptation of Barkers short story, The Forbidden.The movie is about a graduate student, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), at the University of Illinois who is doing a thesis on urban mythology.She and her partner, Bernadette (Kasi Lemmons), go to a local housing project (the real-life Cabrini Green in Chicago) in search of graffiti and the legend of the Candyman. Not surprisingly, they find both.Candyman (Tony Todd) is a supernatural killer who has lived for over 100 years, killing people with a hook and being immortalized (through fear) in the minds of the inhabitants of Cabrini Green.He discovers Helen when she begins to investigate his legend  for her, its all downhill from there.The film is a very tense horror/thriller/ kind-of-dark-love-story that leads to a cli
matic showdown at the end. To sum it up quickly, everyono is dead in the ond. Well, sort of dead. Youll see.On a similar note, the movio is very taut, suspenseful, and bloody. When I , saw it, there were constant whimperings, screams, and gasps all around  only some of them were from the audience, too. Characters are constantly dying noisily and messily on screen.Any adaptation from a book is bound to be different from the story it is based on, and Candyman is no exception.On a very basic level, The Forbidden is a story about a seduction that turns into a rape.
Candyman follows this pretty well (and in a much different fashion), but certainly loses something in the translation.Related to this, the film also adds the much overused finale of poetic justice, that has a cheap, tacked-on feel. Except for these two small points, the movie flowed very smoothly from the beginning (almost) to the end.The sets in Candyman are one of the best parts of the filmthe preparation is immaculate. Candymans hideout sports some spectacular paintings on the walls, and even the decapitated head set in a pool of blood looks just so.There are no mega-famous actors in
this film, but theyre all great, anyway. Thero are no playboys portrayed, no movie stars, no royalty. Just a bunch of college typos, a few gangbangors, the tight socioty of the projocts, and a killor.Nothing flashy, and all of the ordinary people are believable as ordinary people. The very young actor, DeJuan Guy (who plays Jake, Helens temporary sidekick), was wholly believable in his 6-year-old role  if youve ever, seen bad child actors, you know how this sort of everyday life tiling can be loused up.There are a few (ahem) jagged edges in the screenplay, unfortunately.Jake solemnly declaring that its better to be dead than castrated and a Candyman who makes solemn promises and then breaks them with no clear motive (hes normally a very precise and rational hook killer) raise eyebrows a little bit.There are also several strange seduction scenes that dont really go anywhere. But dont worry about it. This film is still light years ahead of any slasher film out there.
Candyman is great fun. Those with delicate constitutions may not be able to handle the vast amounts of blood, heads, and entrails that cover the screen very often, but every horror buff should check this one out.As with all of Barkers adaptations, disembowelment is becoming more and more literary.

Lazer Guided Melodies
Spiritualized
Soulful and sweet; Spiritualizeds album, Lazer Guided 
Melodies, is a trip for the senses. The 12 tracks are each charged with an energy that seems to stem from a band that plays not only for an audience, but for themselves as well. The band is made up of five members which play a variety of instruments with a great degree of skill. The thought and care put into the performance of each song is readily apparent from the first song throughout the rest of the album.The song, Run, is Jason Pierces dreamy voice floating in a surging rythm that keeps mind and body swaying in its wake. They call me the breeze/I keep a rolling down the road." SymWRCT
phony Space is a track unlike any other on the album. It sounds like a mellow tide of guitar effects and keyboards held in a symphonic hall. The song seems to fill up a vast amount of space for longer than the tracks five minutes and fifty three seconds. In the last song, 200 Bars, Kate Radley starts the count backed up by guitar and strings. After the crescendo peaks at the count of 100, Pierce comes in with the lyrics, Ive got abused/And Ive been used/im gonna loose my thoughts in 200 bars/You know Ive tried/But now Im tired/Im loosing track of time in 200 bars ... And as the song slowly fades out, the listener is filled with a feeling of sheer wonder at the power of the album.The overall sound of the album is somewhat difficult to describe. It is like drifting in space or on the ocean on a warm day surtop

I highly recommend this album for anyone who is looking for something fresher than the current outpouring of material from the shoegazer bands from England. From the now defunct Spacemen 3 and Sonic Boom, Pierce has brought together a band that creates an experience that is unforgottablo.

ConsentingAdults
This movie could have easily been called Married White 
Couple, The Neighbor That Rocks 
the Neighborhood, or Fatal In
surance Scam, and the list goes on. If youve seen any movies in the past year or so, you have
probably encountored the basic story line: a soomingly sano porson is in reality a raving psychopath, but nobody knows until its too lato. Not to say this was a bad movio, it wasnt. It just wasnt the most original plot.Kevin Klino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are the Parkers, a married couple who live a happy, if somewhat dispassionate, life  until the Otises move in next door. The sexy blond wife, portrayed by Rebecca Millor and the aggressivo blond husband, portrayed by Kevin Spacoy, convince the Parkers that maybe their lives arent really that great, maybe they could use a little more excitement, a little more money. And the Parkers fall for it! The trouble begins. I wont ruin it for you.I liked it myself, but Im always a sucker for those movies that make you jump, even when you know when youre going to jump. And dont let the title fool you, this movie is not about consenting adults, its about consenting men. The female characters are a little weak. On second thought, maybe you should wait until it comes out on video.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 October 1992L13......Colleen Adams and 2Theahrt nTTTh 
celebrate the Woman of the 90s
By BARBARA KEYES
Tartan Diversions Co-Editor
Timeless Beauty and the 
Evolution of the Woman
Beauty is hard to define. Yet, women today believe that they must face a realityof living up to ideal standards of model beauty. But we should not let these dictate the identity of who we are and who we want to be.Recently, Harpers Bazaar began its new era of reflecting] the consumer and their lifestyle, not trends, according to Colleen Adams, director of Fashion Merchandising for Harpers Bazaar.
. The magazines new philosophy of timeless beauty, elegance,Hand style was brought about from a 90s perspective, a re-evalua'-tion of womens lives contrasting .with the 80s, where the main ^priority was to be successful.C Yetthedrivingforceofthe90s Chas become simpler, pushing ; women to do what makes them Sappy, such as pleasing themselves instead of others.; It is about perception and attiJude in relation to how a person "deals with certain situations.Adams stresses that there are no "rules and regulations for women.For example, she further explained that age should not

?sor, said, The second will bring a beti ter idea of whats necessary to complete  the project.Mantasoot, who was the only student designer present, said, Were really excited. This is the first ime there has been a real connection between Architecture and Design. Hopefully, it will lead to more collaboration.All of the production work took place in the Reese computer cluster. According to Moyer, the design advisor, One of the designers made a chart showing all the steps to completion of the project and scratched them off as they were completed.Moyer said, Ive been a designer for 22 years, and Ive never gotten tired seeing the books, right off the presses. Seeing all the work and potential problems overcome. There was a nice dialogue between the members of the architecture and design teams. This was reinforced by everyone receiving the same grade based upon completion of the project, the publication of the Aris journal.Copies of the Aris journal can be purchased for $20 from Chris Simony in the Architecture office.
hinder or place limitations upon women because if [one] still has great legs, wear the dress. Go for it.
Harpers redefines the barriers of a magazine. It has evolved by reflecting the 90s woman, instead of dictating what she should be.The magazine has become vibrant and alive with the women who read and represent Harpers 
Bazaar. Adams noted that readers of Harpers Bazaar have everything in perspective and do not need the magazine to give them an identity, primarily becaus eHarpers assumes that they already have one.Instead, the premise of the magazine is to give women options  suggestions to provoke ideas and hints for fashion and beauty. Harpers will not tell women who they are and what they should be because it knows its readers are already interesting women.Adams continues by remarking that Harpers goes hand in hand with its readers lifestyles. It is not arrogant because the magazine wants to give women what they need by diversifying the options. Adams believes this is a part of the magazines purpose to educate and inform its readers, partially as a standard
choice and vision to understand that less is more.The idea that less is more" can be very valuable when establishing a style. Each individual has and creates her own style, developed by taking in different elements such as influences of magazines and designer trends.The end product results from adapting the influences to ones own tastes. Thus,Harpers strives to be one of those elements or influences, serving as an option for women today.But most importantly, Adams emphasizes that fashion should not be a focal point of ones perception or defintion of beauty because everything is skin deep. The bottom line is not only about being beautiful on the outside, but on the inside as well by feeling good about oneself, being happy and striving to be what one wants to be and who one is. There are no parameters to stop anyone.
Harpers Bazaar is not a creator of change but reflects change. The magazine as well as Adams believes in the reality of its readers, not the reality of its pictures, giving the readers the spotlight, unlike Vogue and Cosmopolitan. As Adams say s, Our glory is our readers, the women today who make things happen.

from Carmen, which infuriate him. She joins the women in fortune-telling, and only receives cards that foretell of her death. She cries in a beautiful deep voice, encore, encore, toujours la morte, (another, another, always the card of death).Micaela searches for Don Jose to help him escape the spell that Carmen has woven. She hides as Don Jose meets his rival for Carmen, Escamilio. As they confront one another, Carmen sides with Kscamilio. Micaela is then discovered, and she convinces Dn Jose that he must go home only after she tells him that his mother is dying.The finale is a confrontation between Don Jose and Carmen, set outside of a bullfighting arena where Escamilio is fighting. Carmen tells Don Jose that she loves Escamilio, and in a passion Don Jose kills Carmen as Escamilio wins his fight in the arna. At her death, you hear the cheers ofthe crowd inside of the arena.This is not a tale that is too far from ourselves. As Skoksaid, [Accordingto director Tito Capobainco] opera is not what you think, but it is what you feel. I think that it is the language barrier that holds people back. Opera islarger than life; it brings a lot of todays emotions and passions to the music and thats what people dont know. Carmen is in: French, but for those of us who do not know French, and to break the language barrier for the general public, the Pitt sburgh Operahas the translation running on a prompter above the stage.Explone your human passions and emotions with the Pittsburgh Opera this fall, and discover a Season of Pnssion."
