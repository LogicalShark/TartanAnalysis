English Department 
cans "Art of Persuasion"
by Michael Snizek
Ann Hayes, Acting Head of the English 
Department, has announced that the 
course, The Art of Persuasion," an ad
vertising course, will not be offered in the 
fall of 1978. This coursei which is the only 
one taught by advertising executive A1 
Goldman, is perhaps the most popular one 
offered by the English Department.
It appeals to a wide range of students 
primarily because of the nature -of the 
material and because of Mr. Goldmans 
background and experience. Many English, 
Design, and AMS students find the course 
to be extremely useful preparation for in
tended careers in advertising.
Professor Hayes initiated the cancels 
tion procedures for the course late last fall 
when she concluded that the course was 
too informal with no tests, text, or final, 
produced an inordinately high number of 
As and Bs, and more importantly was too 
professional for the goals of the depart
ment. She continued, We must support 
academic and intellectual excellence in our 
department and college. The purpose of 
this department is not to produce absolute
ly marketable skills,, Rather, it is to trainthe student in the use of the English lan
guage. I do believe the course in question 
has a place, but not in the framework of 
this departments goals.
The announcement was initially met 
with disbelief by many of Goldmans stu
dents. Traditionally the most difficult En
glish course to gain admittance to, some 
200 students attempted to enroll for the 
current Spring course only to find it filled 
by 8:30. Many of those same students who 
were unable to enroll in the course are 
writing to Professor Hayes in an attempt to 
pursuade her to change her recommenda
tion.
Professor Hayes reports that the initial 
recommendation was approved by the 
Senior Faculty of the department and has 
been endorsed by H&SS Dean, John 
Crecine.
The course was initially offered in the 
spring of 1975 after Goldman was ap
proached with the idea of teaching an ad~ 
vertising workshop by Professor Lois Fow 
ler. Goldman, a self-made advertising 
executive and recently retired partner of
Marc and Co., one of the largest agencies in 
Pittsburgh, responded favorably to the 
suggestion.
Fowler remarked that her original con
cept of the course -was that of a 3-unit 
workshop seminar limited to 8-10 English 
seniors who had an interest in advertising. 
Today the class is a 6-unit, hour and a half 
free elective open to the entire student 
body with an enrollment of 26, many of 
whom are Design students. I didn't want 
this to happen, I just dont know what 
happened between the conception and the 
creation, Fowler remarked
In the fall of 1975, H&SS was firmly 
committed to the concept of the pro
fessional minor, hoping to prepare grad
uating students with marketable skills. 
When then H&SS Dean Erwin Steinberg 
was approached by former English De

Cancer research begins at CMU
A team of scientists at Carnegie-Mellon 
Institute of Research (CMIR) is beginning 
a two-year study to analyze the effects 
of federal regulations on cancer research, 
treatment, and cancer patients themselves.
The quality and pace of clinical re
search in cancer appears to be hampered by 
the vast body of regulations imposed by 
the federal government,says Richard K. 
Olson, director of the Health Sciences 
Division at CMIR. Regulations designed 
to protect patients from ill-concieved 
research may, in fact, be impeding research 
on the development of the new treatments. 
Medical researchers often feel that the 
government is attempting to control 
scientific research by buifding a wall of 
paperwork around it.  Olson feels that 
this perception impairs their motivation 
and effectiveness, and that ground is 
lost in the search for improved treatment 
techniques.
, The 5300,000 project at CMIR, funded 
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
will include a study of all major laws 
and regulations that apply to cancer re
search. The findings, Olson says, 
will be presented to the federal govern
ment and hopefully result in refinement of
the regulatory mechanisms to provide 
needed patient protection without unduly 
impeding research. We want to protect 
the patient against unreasonable risks, 
Olson adds, but simultaneously, we need 
to make new treatments and procedures 
discovered through research more readily 
available.
Ironically, regulations designed to pro
tect patients can result in costly delays 
inhibiting the introduction of new treat
ments, Olson says. New drugs and pro
cedures must be subjected to extensive 
studies on laboratory animals before they 
receive FDA approval, but such tests 
can prove useless. (To illustrate the diffi
culties faced by researchers, Olson de
scribes the frustrations of one scientist who 
developed a serum for a specific disease. 
He spent $800,000 and two years testing 
his serum on chimpanzees only to discover

Alumni gather
Students are busily preparing for Spring Carnival. For a full schedule of events, see page 32.
Thousands of CMU alumni residing in 
the Pittsburgh metropolitan area will hear 
CMU president Richard M. Cyert comment 
on the state of the university at a series of 
Alumni Challenge banquets planned for 
April.
The meetings are one phase of an on
going Investments In Progress capital 
campaign, launched in 1976, which has the 
goal of raising $100 million dollars, pri
marily for the universitys endowment. 
Now at the halfway point in its three 
year life, the campaign has already resul
ted in pledges for over S64 million dollars.
The Alumni Challenge phase of the 
campaign, conducted by volunteers at 
regional gatherings throughout the coun
try, has the goal of raising $7 million 
through direct contributions from alumni. 
The Pittsburgh area meetings are set for 
April 10, downtown at the Hyatt House, 
Chatham Center; April 1 1 for North Hills 
at the Sheraton North; April 12 for the 
South Hills at the Marriott in Greentree; 
and April 18 in the East at Howard John
son's in Monroeville.
The alumni phase of the campaign has 
greater significance than the funds raised 
alone, says Alumni Challenge Chairman, 
and SARC Conference(Mssues in Business 
Today) speaker. Maxwell Connan, an 
v'ngineering graduate from the chss of 
1939. We cannot ask others to do for the 
university what we will not do ourselves, 
Connan adds.Corporations, foundations, 
and friends who are being asked to coniribuie to I his campaign look first to see 
*h<' tevrl of alumni involvement. We must 
show ihem that we endorse and support
the universitys long range goals.
Most of the funds raised throughout 
the Investments in Progress campaign 
will be added to the universitys permanent 
endowment, now valued at. $110 million 
which provides continuing investment incontinued on page 33

H&SS courses open to entire campus
by Jean Pellegrini
The College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences is making a major effort to attract 
more non-H&SS students to a variety of 
courses being offered in Fall 1978-79, 
according to ,Bill Cohn, director of tiie 
Academic Advisory Center.
We feel that one of our primary 
missions is to offer this scientific-humanis
tic dimension to the other Colleges on 
campus. We are an organization of many 
purposes, one of which is to encourage
a broader intellectual community, Profes
sor Cohn stated. He further remarked that. 
Students should take advantage of the 
resources that we have to offer.
Ludwig F. Schaefer. Professor and 
Head of the History Department, stated, 
Generally speaking, each of the various 
disciplines [History and Philosophy, Eng
lish, Economics, Modern Languages] has a 
different way of perceiving the world and 
understanding society.
Cohn added, This variety provides a

FALL 1978 REGISTRATION
APRIL 12-13,1978
Class Schedules will be available March 30 after 12 noon at the In
formation Desk, Skibo and at the Public Relations Office, Baker Hall 
160.

visory Center BH 161 and should report there for registration in
formation.
All other students must register on April 12 and 13 according to the 
following instructions:
A. Obtain a Class Order Form from your department office.
B. Discuss your Spring course schedule with your advisor and 
complete the Class Order Form. Your advisor will approve 
your schedule by signing the Class Order Form immediately 
below the last course listed.
C. Your advisor will also provide you with your packet of class 
cards. You will need one card for each course.
D. Complete the course section and unit portion of the class cards 
and take one to each department offering the particular cour
se in which you wish to register and ask approval forr 
registration. Department locations are in the Class Schedule. 
If approved, the department will keep your class card.

desired courses, have your advisor approve an alternate cour
se. Repeat steps D & E until you have successfully registered 
for all courses.
F. After you have received department approval for each course 
by presenting a class card, deliver the yellow copy of the Class 
Order Form to you department. The white copy is your receipt.
G. Because new or special students will soon be registering for 
courses which are nnow available to you, it is important to 
register for your total progam now.
H. In May, you will receive a confirrr. ition listing all of the cour
ses for which you have registered.
broader perspective for students...ours is 
an attempt to broaden the students 
point of view.
All H&SS Departments stress that the 
entire student body is welcome to explore 
the opportunities that H&SS has to offer. 
Non-H&SS majors are encouraged to 
stop in the Academic Advisory Center, 
located near die front entrance to Baker 
Hall, at any time to have questions answer
ed.
The Advisory Center is here to act 
as a liason among the various depart
ments, Cohn added.
Cohn discussed the possibility of the 
double-major in H&SS. The double
major is a reality. Each department has 
lowered its unit requirements which is 
an indication that they are trying to attract 
more students. Some students are more 
than half-way through the requirements 
for a double major and dont even realize 
it.
Each H&SS Department has informa
tion concerning course descriptions, credit 
requirements, etc. which can be picked up 
at the Academic Advisory Center or the 
Department offices, all located in Baker 
Hall.
Schaefer, Cohn, and Ann L. Hayes, Pro
fessor and Acting Head of the English 
Department, discussed the unique advan
tages of the Fall course offerings.
The H&SS Interdisciplinary curriculum 
involves courses that include input from 
the various H&SS disciplines. For this 
Fall, the interdisciplinary department 
offers a group of culture courses intended 
to promote a better understanding of so
ciety.
Liberty & Order: The French Revolu
tion & Napoleon (66-201) will be taught 
by representatives of the History and 
Philosophy, and English Departments. 
As outlined in the Course Description, It 
seeks to illuminate the interrelationships 
of the segment-of culture during a period 
particularly significant for the development 
of modern society.
Another course, The Non-west in 
Western Eyes (66-221) will study the 
rest of the world from the Western vantage 
point.The expertise of a rabbi and a priest 
will be combined to teach The Holocaust: 
Toward a Religious Understanding (66- 
315), a course which will analyze the reli
gious meaning of the central events of the 
Holocaust.
Cohn c*ted the History course, 
Business in American Life, as an offering 
which gives the AMS or Engineering 
student, for example, a different perspective 
of the role business has played in the

Senate murmurs 
by Carl Freedman
One of die largest audiences tver was 
present at the March 21 Senate meeting to 
hear what Senate would decide about the 
Watennelon Bash. Jim Carr, physics senior, 
announced at the previous meeting that he 
would make a motion to rescind U.F.O.s 
budget for the funding of the Bash. He 
made the motion and then passed the floor 4k 
to Don Simon, Chairman of Budget 
Refonn Committee.
Simon said that his main objection to die 
funding of the Watennelon Bash is that it is 
a social event. It is Senates policy to fund 
only the social activities diat come from an 
arm of Students Government, such as AB. 
U.F.O. is not in this position. If we fund 
one social event we will have to fund them 
all. He pointed to Senates declining to 
fund the SDC Dance.
Simon also stated that, fraternities do 
restrict membership, and for Senate to fund an event, every student must be able
to benefit from the activity.
In response to Simons statement, M^rK 
Levine said that the entire campus com
munity is welcome at the Watermelon Bash. ^ 
It is not restricted solely to Greeks and 
freshmen, as rush events are. The Bash is 
more of an orientation event.
Responding to Simons comment on 
fraternities restricted membership, Ken 
Meinert said that, we did not fund Spirit 
at one time because it was partisan to 
whom it accepted, but Spirits Black Week 
(a cultural event as detennined by Senate) ^ 
was funded. I dont see the difference be
tween this and U.F.O.s connection with 
die Watermelon Bash. As discussion con
tinued Dave Roussos brought up the point 
of whether Senate should or should not be 
funding social organizations regardless if it 
is U.F.O., SDC or any other.
After nearly an hour and a half of dicussion, the vote was finally taken. It was 
10-92 for rescinding the U.F.O. budget. 
Ken Meinert called for a roll call vote. The 
vote went as follows: Carryes, Cordes 
yes, Deveau-yes, Englemann-yes, Fallonno, Freedman-no, Furman-no, Griffanyes, Innersye$, Lawtonyes, Lubonno, 
McNallno, Meinertno, Monacono, 
Niesenbaumyes, Ohlberg-yes, Roussos 
yes, D. Smithno, E. Smith-yes, Swankabstain, Tumazos-yes, and Gladys-no. <( 
The final vote was 1291 in favor of res
cinding the U.F.O. budget.
In other business, Dave Roussos moved 
that Senate should increase its advertising 
budget from $375 to $800. John Tumazos 
said that he could not justify die increase 
when Senate was forcing other clubs to 
lower their advertising budgets. John 
suggested cheaper means of advertising. ^ 
This motion was sent to the Finance Com
mittee.

Grievance Committee meets
by Scott Sibley
The First meeting of the Student Gov
ernment Grievance Committee was held 
!i the Wherrett Room on Wednesday, 
March 22. Student Government Presi
dent John Tumazos created this com
mittee to hear students gripes and to 
act on them. In his opinion, this commit
tee would not be necessary if Senate was 
doing its job.
Gary Moshier, Senator from CFA, said 
that Housing was trying to raise the occu 
pancy number of a Roselawn building from 
6 to 9. The building has only one usable 
bathroom since the second one is not heat
ed. He was referred to the SDC Housing 
Committee. John Alexander, SDC repre^ 
sentative, said that he would bring it up
when the Committee meets next time.
Carl Freedman (CFA) raised objections 
to the movement of the Music Department 
toward a more conservatory-like program. 
He feels that the University does not have 
adequate facilities to coniDete with other 
conservatory-type schools. Alex Beresniewich, a drama student, agreed that 
practice facilities were inadequate. 
Beresniewicz, Freedman, and Scott Sibley, 
Committee Chairman, agreed to see Presi
dent Cyert about this problem.
The purpose and function of the Com
mittee was discussed next. If was felt that 
the Committee should be an alternative
for students when they do not know where 
to turn. The Committee will refer a person 
to the proper authorities when it can and 
take up the investigation itself when nec
essary.
The possibility of having Cyert attend 
the Committee meetings was discussed. 
It was determined that this is something 
Student Senate is planning to do and 
therefore would not be in line with this 
Committee's program. Instead, it was 
decided that several Grievance Committee 
members will meet with Cyert when the 
need arises. The Committee is going to 
remain fairly informal so that students will 
be more open and expressive with their 
grievances.
WRCT announced that they would be 
introducing a new show in conjunction 
with this Committee. It is to be a call-in 
format show, hosted by John Alexander, 
an English major, titled Whats Your 
Bitch? The program will be aired on 
Wednesdays from 8 to 9 PM starting April
12.
The Grievance Committee will meet 
regularly on Mondays at 7:00 PM in Skibo 
Room 11.
Anyone with any gripes is asked to at
tend. Any student interested in serving on 
the committee should contact Scott Sibley 
at 683-6039, or write to him c/o Pi 
Lambda Phi (Skibo Information Desk).
Senate rejects conflict 
of interest amendment
by Elliot Ohlberg
At the April 4 meeting, Student Senate 
rejected the following amendment to the 
By-Laws;
4} No member of an organization shall
vote on that organizations budget or
Senate murmurs
John Tumazos proposed a Consti
tutional amendment allowing him to 
appoint an Assistant to the Treasurer. The 
$ amendment was tabled until the next 
meeting.An amendment was made by Elliot 
Ohlberg to include ex-student presidents as 
ex-officio members of the Senate until 
they graduate. The amendment was defeat
ed 3-15.During this meeting, Dan Klein, ottered 
to fill the position of Senate Parliamen
tarian on the basis of his experience with 
parliamentary procedure. He was accepted 
without objection.
At the April 4 Senate meeting Tom 
Engelmann reported that Finance Com
mittee lowered the proposed Student 
Senate advertising budget from $800 to 
$600. Engelmann said that the $600 
would be enough if Senate used V* page 
rather than full or page ads.
& Dave Roussos, who originated the 
motion to increase this budget from 
$375, tried to raise the ammount back to 
$800. The budget passed at $600.
Next, Finance Committee recommen
ded that Senate raise Baseball Clubs 
7879 budget by $150 for some additional 
baseball bats. This was also passed.
Finally, a $50 budget to cover operating 
expenses for the Budgetary Reform Committe was brought before Senate. This also 
passed.
Concerning the Watermelon Bash, Jim 
Gladys, President of U.F.O., presented 
Senate With a restraining petition to call a 
referendum on the matter of the funding 
for the Bash. A campus-wide referendum 
will be held before April 25 as dictated by 
the Constitution.
^ Scott Miller pointed out that the Consti
tution also states that a majority vote cast 
would be sufficient to overturn the action 
of Senate only until the end of the semes
ter, at which time Senate must make 
another decision on the matter.
Last meeting, John Tumazos proposed 
a Constitutional amendment to allow 
him to appoint an Assistant to the 
^ Treasurer. The amendment passed.
The Academic Affairs Committee is 
meeting with Vice-president Schatz today.
The next Senate meeting is 7 PM on 
Tuesday, April 18. It should be another 
wild one.
status except Student Senate and its 
budget.
SG President John Tumazos moved to 
amend the By-Laws as such, with expecta
tions of little opposition
Student Senate attempts to follow the 
parliamentary procedure detailed in Rob
erts Rules of Order, which state that if a 
member has a conflict of interest, the 
member should not vote. Tumazos felt that 
it could not be assumed that Senators were 
always abstaining when they should, (when 
a conflict could be construed).
Dan Monaco (CFA) stated that since it 
was already stated in Roberts Rules, it 
should be left to the Senators to rule their 
own conscience.
Jim Carr (MIS) agreed, saying its just 
not right to assume that people will do the 
dishonest thing. Carr also noted that the 
amendment would have the effect of dis
qualifying approximately half the Senate 
from voting on the UFO or SDC budgets.
The amendment was defeated 8-11, 
with one abstention. Tumazos called for a 
roll call vote to insure that individual Sen
ators names were on the record as voting 
one way or the other. Tumazos was ruled 
out of order by Chairperson Scott Miller 
(CIT), who felt that the vote was not close 
enough to merit the roll call vote. Elliot 
Ohlberg (MIS) appealed the decision of the 
Chair. The vote to overrule the Chair and 
take the roll call vote passed 11-8-1.
The final vote on the amendment was 8-
12. It is the responsibility of all students to 
ask their Student Senator why they voted 
as they did, and to tell them how they 
would have voted if given the opportunity.
One of the new Senators voting against 
the amendment said later that it was very 
confusing and she was not aware of the 
full implications. The amendment may be 
considered again, possibly with some re
finements.
For the record:
Yes-Dan Cordes (CIT), Tom Engelman 
(MIS), Mike Inners (MIS), Mary Ann 
Lawton (CIT), Elliot Ohlberg (MIS), 
Randy Peterson (GSIA), David Roussos 
(H&SS), John Tumazos (Pres, SG)

TARTAN
The way to greatness
A great university deserves no mercy, Its educational 
quality must always be questioned, and the manner in 
which it prepares its graduates for the immediate hereafter 
must be analyzed constantly. We must keep CMU under 
the microscope at all times if we want to insure its might, 
prominence, and ability to graduate competent job-winners.
President Cyert is walking a selMefined road to excel
lence in search of the great university. He must be com
mended for his zeal and concern. His latest Message to Par
ents honestly appraises the educational situation at CMU, 
and realistically identifies some of the problems
The President has two pet projects designed to keep CMU 
on its toes. The first is an institute for the study of educa
tion that would allow educators to stand back and take a 
look at their work and methods. Ur, Cyert feels that pro
fessors in the midst of teaching cannot accurately evaluate 
their performances on a long range basis. This institute 
would attempt to study higher education over a five or 
ten year spread, and the results would be beneficial not 
only to CMU, but to other universties as well.
Dr. Cyert's second project involves a two day conference 
in May for administrators, department heads, deans, and 
some faculty members. The conclave will be held at the 
Hospitality Inn in Monroeville. Although Monroeville is 
just a few miles down the Parkway, Dr. Cyert hopes that 
the get-away  will give his staff a chance to focus, with
out interruption ,on ways to go about achieveing his "stra
tegies of excellence .
CMU is not alone in its quest for quality educationc The 
University of Texas at Austin recently held a contest and 
awarded twenty-three faculty members between $600 and 
$7,500 for developing projects to improve the quality of 
undergraduate teaching. One of the winners proposed that 
graduate students teaching undergraduate courses be video
taped in action. The films would then be played back for 
the grad-teachers during special coaching sessions.
California State University has been running a grant pro
gram open to both students and faculty members for the 
past five years. So far, the competitive program has involved 
about 7,000 faculty members and85,000students in some 
project related activity. Almost 85% of the projects funded 
have become a permanent part of the campus curriculumc
This week, a letter to the editor by a recent alumni asks 
that we suggest useful outlets for funds collected through 
the Investments in Progress". The TARTAN would like to 
encourage students to show initiative and make recommen
dations for ways to spend this money for quality educationc
Of course, quality-education goes hand in hand with 
"useful-education, and the TARTAN feels that we should 
show no mercy when demanding the education we need to 
get a good job. Civil Engineers should be informed by their 
departments that a surveying course offered by the Military 
Science Department is worthwhile because employers like 
graduates to have it. Mech Es should be told that employers 
like job applicants who have a lot of lab experience; not 
stressed heavily enough at CMU. Engineers in general should 
be made aware that drafting courses in mechanical drawing 
are often plus-signs on resumes.
We must also question the removal of courses like At 
Goldmans Art of Persuasion Probably the most popular 
H&SS course in the colleges history, the professionallyoriented class seemed to be the perfect example that there 
are jobs related to liberal arts. When departments remove 
courses like Art of Persuasion*, we must demand explana
tions. The reasoning might be valid, but it should be de
manded, nonetheless.
Also, when departments successfully try to package ap
proaches to useful-education or job hunting, as Fine Arts 
did with its new job searching booklet, we should be appre
ciative and receptive.
Quality-education and useful-education are what make a 
university great. We should always be on the prowl for a 
better method, a better curriculum, or a better formula for 
getting the job .And we should never show mercy. Its the 
only way to greatness.

If You Want It
Editor:
I am a recent graduate and on 
my own in the real world. I 
attended my first alumni function 
the other night and met my local 
clan. The experience was interesting-and so were the people. 
CMU produces a unique individualeducated, bright, sophisticated and 
eager to keep the Carnegie spirit 
alive.
However, being so new at this 
alumnus role and having so many 
memories still clear in my mind, 
I have a different view of the Uni
versity than most of,the 1925, 
45, or even '68 alumni.
The dinner I attended was part 
of the Investments in Progress 
campaign which consisted of the 
usual speeches on the need to 
raise money for research grants, 
chairs for the departments, library 
improvements, and dorm and cam
pus improvements. It also in
cluded an excellent film made 
within the last year-flashbacks on 
Tech history, views of the
giant steps made in science and 
computer research and various 
campus and department activities. 
The one shortcoming the program 
seems to have is not examining 
the needs of the smaller depart
ments on campus; these needs 
seemingly viewed as insignificant.
Any feelings 1 have to bring up 
would be prejudiced towards the 
needs of my department. So I 
will refrain. All I am suggesting 
to you, the present student body, 
is that since this campaign is cur
rently in progress and funds may 
be available for delegation, you 
may have pertinent suggestions 
for your department, project, or 
organization. While they are pass
ing out a few thousand for this 
and a few thousand for another 
thing, maybe a few hundred dol
lars is all that would be needed to 
help your interests. Make your 
ideas known. . . NOW!
I am not belittling research 
grants or campus improvements 
by any means. I just don't want 
other significant areas of student 
interest and well-being to be
overlooked.

unjustly denied UFO funds. It 
si-jms that one thing all students 
can count on: any event in an 
open campus area that admits 
and entertains all students free of 
cost is not a social event. It is 
some undefined event Senate 
wishes to ignore.
Nextly, we would like to ex
press our belief that Senate did 
*>t (and does not) represent the 
wishes of its constituents. Though 
the senators are the students 
elected officials, they conduct 
themselves as some elite group. 
During the meeting when members 
of the student audience spoke, the 
senators offered little attention or 
respect for their constituents. In-)ead, they whispered and talked 
among themselves.
At one point when a totally 
appalled audience itself became 
too boisterous, Chairman Scott 
Miller threatened to dismiss all 
spectators from the room. Is that 
legal? Can twenty-one students 
tell all other students interested 
^iiough to attend the meeting 
that they must leave? Can twentyone students that once prostituted 
themselves as being responsible 
be allowed to do so without our 
views being expressed? Appar
entlyyes. One thing the silent 
student body must realize: such 
misdirected actions cannot persist. 
It is all our money that Senate 
^rhanipulates. We need responsible 
people in office.
Finally, we would like to voice 
our total lack of respect for Stu
dent Government President John 
iumazos. luma/os voted to res
cind UFO funds-i*fter pledging in 
his campaign to support the 
Greeks. When questioned from 
^the floor about his change of face, 
he did not try to deny it. He ad
mitted before the Senate that he 
attributed his vote into office as 
due to the Greek vote, but then 
answered the floor with a tough 
luck politicians shrug. John Tu
mazos is, indeed, a politician at 
heart and not a representative 
Svith the student body's interests 
at heart. It is not a nice feeling to 
be slapped in the face.
And for UFO-what now? Do 
the fraternities and sororities slap 
back and regress to the level on 
which Senate operates? Should 
they restrict admissions to the 
Bash, or should they leave it open 
Vin the spirit it was originally meant 
for-paying from their own pock' 
ets? It is not an easy decision.
If we have not yet convinced 
you that Senate is irresponsible 
in its legislation, consider these 
facts:
1) A motion by Chris Deveau 
to limit discussion until 8:30 was
not voted on until about 9:00.
2) One senator who attended 
less than one third of the meet
ing did not abstain, but rather 
voted to rescind.
3) Jim Carr and Michael Inners, 
who made the motion, needed the 
eternal Don Simon to present it. 
Apparently, we elected two sena
tors who are incompetent in 
speech.
4) Dean Swank interrupted de
bate at one point to say, I am 
totally baffled. He was not the 
only one.
5) Don Simon stated Senate 
could not afford to fund all 
parties that the students want. 
Maybe just those that the stu
dents dont want.
In light of all these facts, we urge 
all students to attend a Senate 
meeting. Find out what is happen
ing with your activities fee and 
make sure your senators are re
presenting your wishes. Get a 
copy of the Senate minutes at 
the Information Desk; those ot 
March 21 read like the script to 
Abbott and Costellos Whos on 
First? They merely re-emphasize 
our point that Senate is not re
sponsible. We cannot continue to 
be apathetic towards this organiza
tion. They are our voice on campus-or are they? Respectfully
David Mongeau

I always read the Parents

out exception find it to be very 
informative, well-written, and 
uplifting. It serves as an excellent 
source of accurate information on 
the Universitys goals, plans, phil

it further reinforces my belief

I would like to express the 
feelings of many people in Mar
garet Morrison regarding the CocaCola machine which was installed. 
It is viewed as a positive asset of 
the building infinitely better than 
the half-full, warm, flat cu^s of 
soda that can be had on the se

takes care of it does it more as a 
service than a money making ven
ture and does a fine job. The ma

good bit more than can be said

The Easy Life

Editor:
I grew up in a lower middle 
class neighborhood in Brooklyn.
I used to sit on the steps in warm 
weather and enjoy the feeling 
of being part of my neighbor
hood.
I still remember the wonder
ful block party we had to cele
brate the end of World War II.
It was my block and I felt that, 
in some way, I belonged to 
every family.
When I drive through the 
old neighborhood today, I see 
very few people on the streets. 
The ethereal glow of television 
sets can be seen in most of the 
windows. Warm summer evenings 
dont invite strolls anymore. The 
monotonous drone of air con
ditioners fills the air.
Whats happening to our 
world? We are becoming spec
tators rather than participants 
in life. Risking being cynical,
I think we need a course in how 
to live in our own cities. We 
could learn a lot from the cities 
of Europe, but even more from 
those in the Third World. The 
objective opinion of an out
sider can, at times, be more 
valid than our own.
The people in developing coun
tries have such easy access to 
machines for diversion. They 
depend more upon each other. 
At first, when they come to 
visit us they are greatly impres
sed by our technological prog
ress. However, when they look 
deeper, they see^ a society which 
values material gain to the de
triment of human values. They 
see a society which creates old 
age homes, orphanages and day 
care nurseries in order to free 
its more productive members 
from some of lifes ordinary 
responsibilities.
It is my opinion that we 
need to be constantly chal
lenged about the direction which 
our progress is taking us. A 
first step should be to become 
more aware of the changing 
patterns of our lives. Once we 
recognize the problem, we should 
take steps to change our lives
before the patterns become too 
deeply ingrained. My fear is 
that, too often, we unsuspectedly become hooked, like addicts 
on more and more conveniences.
Maybe there is something we 
can learn about ourselves with 
the help of the Third World 
people. Perhaps we should begin 
to truly improve the quality of 
our lives; not with machines 
and gadgets but with each other. 
Having more does not mean 
being more.

Offended
Editor:
I expect April Fools issues of 
university newspapers to be sophomoric, dull, and not in the best 
of taste, and the recent Natrat was 
no disappointment. I can even 
suffer the misrepresentations and 
falsehoods in peace, as they are
not' harmful to anything but my 
esthetic sense. However, when the 
humor degenerates to racial 
slurs and jokes about genocide, 
the line between mere bad taste 
and destructive insults is crossed.
Hence I am highly offended by 
the presence of the entry about 
Ilse Koch in the Announcements 
on p. 3. This is an affront to the 
Jewish community and to the mil
lions of others who cannot forget 
the crimes of Hitler and his hench
men. It is particularly heinous in 
light of the recent increase in Nazi 
and other racist activity in the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and the German Federal Republic.
Furthermore, the characteriza
tion of Ugandans as cannibals on 
p. 1 bespeaks at best gross insensi
tivity to the suffering which such 
stereotypes have for centuries en
gendered among black people in 
both Africa and America. (What 
one may think of the policies of 
Idi Amin is utterly irrelevant to 
the racism inherent in such an at
tack upon the Ugandan people as 
a whole.) It was not long ago that 
the presentation of this and simi
lar images of black people was 
largely dropped from Americas 
school systems, and that victory is 
by no means complete.
I see no reason for the printing, 
even as low humor, of this sort of 
trash, especially in a university 
newspaper supported by all of the 
students, and I demand an apolo
gyDaniel Mark Rosenblum
graduate student, SUPA
Mr. Rosenblum-The TARTAN 
must apologize. The FOLIO edi
tor copied the announcement 
from a 1953 NA TRA T. She didn V 
know who Ilse Koch was, and re
printed it. Were sorry that we 
didnt know enough to not print 
the ad, but were sorrier that our 
1953 staffers, who most definitely 
knew, printed it in the first place. 
Again, our apologies.
The Editor
When Does Life Begin? 
Editor:
In an article in the March 7 
TARTAN, Julian Singer attempts 
to argue on the basis of logic and 
particular ethical considerations 
that abortion should remain legal. 
We would support an approach 
which examines carefully the evi
dence and information available; 
however, contrary to the claims 
of Mr. Singer we submit that he 
himself writes within a very spe
cific subjective framework and, 
further, that the logical conclu
sions of his framework have very 
real and serious implications which 
must be reckoned with.
Mr. Singers arguments rely 
heavily upon what he calls the 
socio-economic necessity" of 
abortion. One particular aspect of 
this position is that the living con
ditions of the poor family would 
improve if the family were to have 
fewer children. Whatever the mer
its of this argument, it is a far cry 
from saying that abortion con
stitutes the necessary means for 
controlling the number of child
ren in a family. For parents who 
do not wish to have children, 
there are many other means of 
conception control available; thus
it is not the case that outlawing 
abortion necessarily implies an 
increase in unwanted children. 
Furthermore /Third Worldcountries where arguments about pop
ulation control are most compel
ling, families there have rejected 
all, if any, forms of population 
control, considering it to be a 
form of genocide and an attack 
on their means of livelihood. 
Abortion does not appear to be 
the necessary ingredient upon 
which the poor areas of the world 
depend.
Mr. Singer also discusses the 
right of choice for the parents, 
paying particular attention to the 
role of women bearing unwanted 
children. He argues, for example, 
that adoption may be an unaccept
able alternative to abortion, since 
the woman may not wish to bear 
the rigors and discomforts of 
pregnancy. However, in addition 
to the nine-month gestation per
iod which are Jimited biologically 
to the woman, there are the fifteen-odd years required to care 
for and raise a child, being the re
sponsibility of both parents. If 
this child-raising process proves 
uncomfortable after say, five 
years, why not kill the child rather 
than force him or her to face 
further trauma of being unwanted 
by the parents? By law, this op
tion is not the very personal 
choice of the parents, but rather 
an extreme form of child abuse 
which is very much the concerr 
of the state.
Why is the elimination of life 
acceptable in one instance and not 
in another? This brings us to a 
very basic question of principle: 
when does life begin, or, when 
does the prevention of life be
come murder? Before addressing 
Mr. Singers approach to this 
question, we shall examine first 
some other commonly proposed 
statements of principle. Actually, 
there are very few basic approaches 
which can be applied consistently.
One possiblity is that life be
gins when the fetus becomes viable, 
that is, at such time as it can sur
vive outside the mothers womb if 
delivered. However plausible a 
medical demonstration this may 
be that life has indeed begun at 
least by this time (one must con
sider that further medical progress 
can only push the time of viability 
back further), it is already in con
flict with the guidelines established 
by the 1973 Supreme Court de
cision: deliveries of premature ba
bies have been performed as early 
as twenty weeks into the preg
nancy-well within the allowed 
time for legal abortions. Thus, if 
Mr. Singer favors the 1973 guide
lines, he has implicitly rejected 
viability as the basis for the be
ginning of life.
An alternate approach which is 
commonly proposed is that the 
fetus is non-human inside the 
womb, and does not become hu
man until after birth. This is 
essentially the implication of the 
1973 decision, and one of its 
logical conclusions is that to kill 
a baby shortly after birth con
stitutes murder, whereas destroy
ing the unborn child a few days 
earlier is perfectly legal (cases 
involving the former possiblity are 
already being brought to trial). 
If this appears to be a rather arbi---------------------------------------------------

trary distinction, one can avoid 
the conflict by making it legal to 
kill the baby within some time 
period after birth: as discussed 
above, this amounts to infanti
cide, an extreme form of child 
abuse.
If one accepts the proposal 
that a fetus is non-human while 
inside the womb, there are still 
legal contradictions which must 
be faced. Previous court cases 
have established precedents for 
the unborn, which give him or
her the right to inherit, or to be 
represented in court in a lawsuit 
relating to injuries received while 
inside the womb. Ironically, in 
view of the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision, the unborn have legal 
rights similar to those of the 
bom, except for the right to live.
There is also a third possible 
position, namely that life begins 
at conception. It has in its favor 
both the legal precedents which 
support the rights of the unborn, 
as well as the medical evidence
which indicates that the fetus in 
the womb is very much alive. 
However, Mr. Singer does not ad
dress such evidence which is al
ready available, stating flatly that 
the question of when life begins 
is a completely unsettled one 
(one wonders as to what sort of 
evidence he would ever consider 
to be acceptable). Furthermore, 
he rejects the possiblity that life 
begins at conception, with a state
ment which implies that such r 
possiblity is as arbitrary as one in
which the life of a child begins in 
the mind of the parent, and that, 
regardless of its merits, that it is
the subjective opinion of a min
ority group wishing to impose its 
views upon the rest of society. 
Nevertheless, the solution which 
Mr. Singer has presented stems 
from his own subjective viewpoint: 
while claiming that the question 
of when life begins is yet unan
swered, he opts to wait for further 
evidence; in the meantime, however, his support of abortion-or 
demand is not a neutral one, but 
instead anticipates an answer 
which confirms his personal notion 
that a viable fetus is not a human 
being with any legal right to live. 
But what of the thousands of hu
mans killed in the balance (upon 
whom his principles have been 
imposed), if the evidence prove: 
him wrong? '

FEMURES
MODERN LANGUAGE DEPARTMENTSummer language study could be for you
by Linda Deak
Enrolling in the Modern Language De
partments Intensive Language Program 
wont guarantee that you will become a 
French lover, a German spy, or a Spanish 
dancer, but it will give you the opportunity 
to become a competent and confident 
speaker of the French, German, or Spanish 
language.
The still innovative Intensive Language 
Program is being conducted during both 
78 summer sessions. Hal Rennert, an 
assistant professor of German and last 
summers coordinator,, describes each sixweek session as a total immersion in 
the foreign language. His description is 
very appropriate for the daily four hour 
classes, which include an instruction 
period, language lab and homework drill 
session.
Rennert commented on the differences 
between the intensive study in French, 
German and Spanish, and the regular 
courses offered during the fall and spring 
terms. Classes will be held in a central 
location, Margaret Morrison, and almost all 
instruction will be in the target, or foreign 
language. The material which is usually 
covered in a 15 week semester is covered in
6 weeks.
The first session of the Intensive Lan
guage Program, scheduled for May 16 to 
June 23, will be aimed at those with little 
or no previous language experience. The 
second session, comparable to the second
semester of a year of instruction, will be 
open to those who have taken the first 
summer session,, or who have had previous 
experience in that language. By taking 
both sessions, students and faculty can gain 
a full year (24 units) of language credit.
The Intensive Language Program was 
offered for the first time last summer, 
with a very impressive response. Over 35 
students and professors were enrolled in 
the first session of German and Spanish 
intensive study.
Many of the 35 took the German and 
Spanish intensive studies for various rea
sons. Hugh D. Young, professor of physics, 
completed the first semester of German 
study because of a personal interest in the 
language. I have travelled in Germany a 
few times and I have been able to pick up 
some German. I enrolled in the intensive 
study course' because I wanted to be able 
to communicate with the native Germans. 
The intensive immersion in German was 
the best way to learn, for I was forced to 
speak it.
Pauline Goldstein, who works at the Hunt Library as an acquisitions librarian 
elected both intensive study German 
courses. She claims, They were very 
worthwhile courses. I took them because I 
needed to have a greater facility with Ger
man in my work. The courses are demand
ing and you have to put in after-class 
hours, but I must say both semesters were 
two of the best summer courses that Ive 
taken at CMU.
Fulfilling his H&SS language require
ment, David Roussos completed both 
semesters of the Intensive study Spanish 
taught by Professor Layera. He says, 
I have been exposed to all types of high 
school and college language courses, and 
this was the best. Being with a group of 
students five days a week, four hours a 
day, conversing in Spanish, is the next 
best thing to being in the native country.
I even learned a few Spanish dirty words. 
The intensive study in French was not 
offered, due to a registration problem. To 
avoid a recurrence,, Rennert advises 
those who are interested to pre-register
with the Director of Summer Studies at 
the Admissions Office.
The teaching staff of the 78 Intensive 
Language Program are: Jim Antos,
Michel Fougeres, French; Hal Rennert and 
Jim Wehner, German; and Ramon Layera, 
Spanish. The teaching staff is very optim
istic about the success of this years pro
gram. Speaking on behalf of the language 
staff, Rennert commented, We hope that 
CMU eventually becomes a summer lan
guage institute. Our Intensive Language 
Program is perhaps the most efficient 
and enjoyable method of language instruc
tion.

INVESTMENTSTake stock in your future
by David Humphreys Jones
The college student does not have to be 
an economics major to be interested in the 
field of investments, whether it be stocks, 
mutual funds, or other more sophisticated 
forms of securities.
What is the easiest, simplest investment 
which can be rewarding in many and vari
ous ways? Mutual funds; tailored to the ob
jectives and wishes of the investor. There 
are speculative growth-oriented ones, more 
conservative growth and income-oriented 
ones that combine growth-potenti"1 and 
compounding of income, ant* he very v nservative bond funds whose grov Js most
ly all by compounding interest. Also you 
have the added safety of diversification, 
professional management, a combination 
of growth and income compounding, plus 
simplification and ease of handling. The 
funds do most all of the paper work for 
you.
O.K., how about you independent 
swingers who want to do your own thing? 
By gosh, broker, give me all the dope on 
the following companies I have heard of, 
and Ill make my own decisions. Allright, 
if that is the way you wish to play it. How
ever, due to the higher operational expense 
of handling small orders, most brokers will 
discourage small orders in that they are 
money-losers to the brokerage house, and 
the investor feels he is being charged a high 
commission. Different brokerage houses 
have varying policies on this. Some for 
good will and hope of future larger orders 
will accept some modest orders. Check 
with your broker.
Stocks have the greatest fascination for 
younger people. They represent ownership 
in a company. If the company prospers, 
the stock rises. If the company falters, the 
stock falls. To make money, one has to 
take some risk. It is a matter of how fast 
one wishes to go. The faster one goes, the 
greater the risk. However, therein also lies
the opportunity for greater rewards. Would 
you rather have a stock that has the possi
bility of doubling in two or three years 
(yes, I said years; the ones that could do it 
in two or three months I wouldnt give to 
my mother-in-law!) or a conservative utili
ty that pays 8% to 9% yearly with very 
modest growth potential. (Of course, if 
you compound that, it doubles every 1XA 
years).
There are also conservative preferred 
stocks with generous dividends. For an 
added fillip there are convertible pre
ferreds that offer a generous dividend with 
growth potential due to the convertability 
into common stock. See your broker; he 
will show you the advantages as well as the 
disadvantages of these.
The study of the various investments, 
whether it be swinging stocks, staid
bonds, mutual funds, or inexpensive gyrat
ing options, can fascinate anyone. How
ever, my strongest advice is to study the 
various forms of investments during your 
collegiate days, make a few imaginary in
vestments, follow them up as if you had 
real money in them, study, evaluate, and 
judge. After school is over, when you have 
a good job, have adequate insurance and 
savings, and have extra money left over, 
then see your broker. It is time to do some 
financial planning to provide for your fu
ture. A second income not only offers a 
more enjoyable life, but helps smooth out 
some of the rough spots. Try it; you may 
like it.

York Stock Exchange.
Margaret Mead claims co-ed 
dorms lead to better sex
Anthropologist Margaret Mead praised 
college students living in coeducational 
dormitories for developing a kind of 
taboo against serious dating among 
themselves, saying it will help prepare them 
for future non-sexist relations in the work
ing world.
Young women and young men who 
later will have to work side by side, in 
superordinate and subordinate regions as 
well as equals and members of a team, are 
finding their way toward a kind of har
mony in which exploitative sex is set 
aside in favor of mutual concern, shared 
interests and a new sense of friendship, 
Dr. Mead explained in her monthly column 
in the cwent(April) issue of Redbook 
magazine, released recently.
Dr. Mead added that although many of
their elders objected to coeducational 
dormitories, assuming them to be a vehicle 
for freer sexual access, young men and 
women have used the living situation to 
become friends and to discover that they 
are alike as people in many ways.
It is just a beginning, but students can 
set a style that will carry over into working 
relations in which skill, ability and exper
ience are the criteria by which persons are 
judged, and appreciation of a woman or 
a man as a whole person will deeply 
modify the exploitation and the anguish of 
sexual inequality, Dr. Mead commented.
She advocated that a similar taboo be 
adopted by the business world. We need 
one that says clearly and unequivocally 
You dont make passes at or sleep with 
the people you worK with.
CAREERSRyan's summer 
job hints
by Dennis Ryan
Its that time of year again when many 
students are preoccupied with the task of 
finding a job. It may be a job that repre
sents a first career step beyond a degree. 
Or,it may be a summer opportunity,the in
come helping with the following years 
school costs, and possibly presenting the 
chance to gain some valuable career exper
ience.
Whatever the nature of the employement sought, the process of obtaining a 
suitable position can be the source of a 
considerable amount of anxiety, frustra
tion and bewilderment to some students. 
Because of this, I am sometimes asked for 
my suggestions about how one can improve 
his or her chances of being offered a job 
that is compatible with one*s needs, in
terests and abilities. There is no single 
formula which insures such success and I 
will not discount the occasional presence 
of just plain luck. But there are some 
elements which are often commonly pre
sent in the strategy of successful job can
didates that, when applied, might genuine
ly enhance ones employability. Attention 
to these can frequently spell the difference 
between a job offer and no job at all.
Know yourself. Its vitally important, 
if you are to succeed in the job market, 
that you have a clear understanding of 
yourself. Make a careful and honest exam
ination of your likes and dislikes, strengths 
and weaknesses, skills, traits, knowledge 
base, values and goals. An understanding of 
these will have important implications for 
the type of work you choose to pursue. 
Employers will also focus upon these items 
as they assess your fitness for the position 
you are seeking. For, in addition to calling 
for prescribed educational or experiencial 
qualifications, many occupations and pro> 
fessions are seen to be most effectively

Sweat, hot flashes, rising temperatures ...
Fresh off the truck ATO tenderly carries its machine to hill 1.
by David Mongeau
The mercury is rising and most college 
cam puses have responded by packing up 
the pigskins and helmets and looking to 
lazy spring days. But in this corner of 
Pittsburgh, Carnegic-Mcllon University has 
been alive for weeks, preparing for Buggy 
Sweepstakes..
Sweepstakes is perhaps the most excit
ing and unique event to be seen on campus 
during (Mil's annual spring carnival. 
What began as a bathtub race in 1920 has 
evolved into combination derby and track 
race a race that sparks cloak-and-dagger 
tactics between participants, astronom
ical alumni donations and a spirit un
matched by any gridiron victory on cam
pus.
.Why so much fuss over a glorified soap 
box derby? You don't understand until 
the day of the race. said Q 1 ddy, a 
former female buggy driver for Fringe, the 
architecture club at CMU: You come out 
and thousands of people are lining the 
streets:there's jumpy music.chanting.and 
all these vans and tents hiding the buggies. 
People are getting ready for something 
very different and you can feel it."
One buggy chairman at one of the fiats 
responded more directly to the question 
of Why buggy?" claiming, Race day is 
the answer. Spectators twenty people deep 
fill Schenley to see these absurd little 
things roll past. Competitive athletics and 
competitive engineering arc there so people 
can compete' in something testing their 
strength and their minds. No one can 
really explain why they go through the 
torture of free rolls and practices; but I will 
get up for buggy at 4:00 before I will for a 
class at N:30. It's a tradition and we are 
carrying it out for posterity.
You can feel it, too. I first sensed the 
buggy fever, when 1 jogged over to Mar
garet Morrison with some seventy ardent 
buggy advocates at 4.00 in the morning.
A kiss for luck Scott West tells the driver to have a nice run.
The members of the fraternities and clubs *involved merged on the hilly streets of 
Schenley Park for a practice run, or free 
roll. Fach team huddled around their 
buggies protecting them from the wary 
eyes and ears of their competitors; few 
talked but all darted about preparing for 
the workout: the attempt of five pushers 
and a driver to cover the course in the least 
amount of time pushing the buggy up the 
five slopes of the course and letting it roll 
down hill. All this passes in less than three 
minutes for the push team, but so many 
more individuals are involved to make 
those three minutes possible.
Buggy is the testing ground for the 
engineers and designers, the pushers and 
drivers of various organizations to synthe
size their knowledge; it is tradition and 
spirit racing down the eight tenths of a 
mile course at up to fifty miles an hour 
using pure physical strength and aptitude.
0 tried to explain buggy fever saying, 
Its very ironic because the whole thing 
takes place in less than three minutes; 
but its a unique activity taking engineer
ing, athletic skills and a well-trained driver 
to come off; and buggy does come off 
every year because people are really de
voted to something so totally different; 
it's bigger than anything on this campus.
Buggies arc a tradition; they have attracted the people of Pittsburgh for 
fifty-seven years. They have grown and 
changed with technology and greater 
interest, discontinued only during the war. 
This half century tradition has produced 
a buggy today that is typically a six-foot, 
sleek fiberglass shell raised on four wheels 
a foot from the ground with a push-pole 
extending from the back.
Indeed, the most intriguing members 
of Sweepstakes are the buggy drivers, 
who risk their lives but enjoy the thrill 
of driving. Q sounds loudly, No one 
should be scared, because the (safety) 
regulations are so strict. Those sweepers 
aren't out at 4:00 sweeping the course for 
fun; it's all a safety measure. Ive only
the whole thing is when Im ifiside and all
I can see is all these feet, but I hear the 
cheering and the yelling cmon, cmon 
from these feet. Everyone is part of it. 
Everyonethose watching and those participatingare joined together in the 
fun of the race; but more than fun is 
involved in buggy. The best and the worst 
is brought out in the buggy bunch. It is 
this human dimension that makes buggy
that it is perhaps over-emphasized: Buggy 
is important to everyone involved. My 
experience is that most people are open 
to share ideas, because the only way to I.
prove you are the best is to make sure 
everyone else is doing their best; then when 
you win youve got something to be proud 
of.
Optimism would favor Bobs opinion, 
but when it comes to winning, the worst

This driver is crammed into a Fringe vehicle. He wonders, Is it really worth it?"
Q Eddy, a former Fringe driver, explains what it's 
REALL> ike!
You come out and thousands of 
people are lining the streets: theres 
jumpy music, chanting, and all these 
vans and tents hiding the buggies. 
People are getting ready for some
thing very different and you can feel 
it. "
swept once, but I'd like to do it again 
because I learn about the course that 
way. Believe me inside the buggy, you feel 
every crack and pebble: any crack bigger 
than an inch we call abig mamma.* No one 
likes to hit a big mamma! it could be 
deadly and a pot hole would be death. 
Toby Kramer, a driver of two years 
ago, attempted to explain her experience 
from the confines of her buggy: I guess
the captivating cult it is at CMIL Its 
like a boy scout secrecy. laughed 0 
describing the competition among the 
participants. Its almost . cutthroat, 
though, very tight: you don't realize how 
much planning goes into it all. I think the 
secrecy is purely a psyche-out, and there 
arc a lot ot pyche-out tactics. l or exam
ple, it you are doing exceptionally well 
some free roll, you Irown and tell everyone 
how terrible things are goingIt's all part 
of the game.
Doug substantiated Qs claim saying, 
It is like spies; no one tells anyone any
thing if possible. Im willing to swipe 
anything I can from the others, too. 
Boh McCabe, a pusher, is disgusted by the 
enire cloak-and-dagger issue, remarking
of the buggy fever is often at hand. Com
petition has produced secret solutions 
to harden the rubber of the wheels: faulty 
brake systems to insure maximum speed; 
and M few espionage capers between 
fraternities breaking in on each other's 
workshops. The l)elts(Delta Tau Delta 
fraternity) accident in l%4 happened 
because the driver was trying to keep the 
buggy in one piece, endangering his own 
life, which resulted in his becoming para
lyzed. People are that fanatical about it.

But still the buggies roll and most 
everyone involved accepts the worst; 
even these risks don't deter them. And the

involved is: Buggy is fun: buggy is CMU;
...the attempt of five pushers and a 
driver to cover the course in the least 
amount of time pushing the buggy 
up five slopes of the course and let
ting it roll down hill"
and as simple as the idea is, Im convinced 
that the tradition, petty competition and 
other hassles of Sweepstakes, are, in 
fact, accepted for those few magical mom
ents of race day. All the worst is obliter
ated when the gun sounds and IT has 
begun.
All the hours of pushing, building and 
designing-every tiling you've worked forare caught in those three minutes; and for 
those three minutes youll suffer the 
three hundred hours, Toby exuded, and 
these are her words after having crashed 
into a tree at 40 mph, after being sideswiped by another buggy!
Race day binds everyone in a union 
unlike any activity on campus. Q has been 
attending the  Tech Sweepstakes since 
childhood; she described last years race: 
I got up at six in the morning when the 
rest of Pittsburgh was literally asleep. Then 
I drove pretty much through deserted 
streets to school and then I heard it. WRCT 
(school radio) was marking the countdown 
to the race; music was playing and a flock 
of people were slowly moving through the 
cold to Schenley. The noise and excite
ment just swept me in and I knew some
thing great and different was going to 
happen
The future and continuation of sweep
stakes is certain. The only question is the 
limit of new ideas from the students of 
CMU; for they alone through endurance 
and dedication have brought buggy this 
far-to a powerful and outstanding event.

Be realistic in your expectations. It is 
safe to say that virtually every job choice 
requires some degree of compromise, for it 
the world is seldom how we would like it 
to be. In seeking a job, you may find that 
the positions initial responsibilities are not 
on an expected level, the salary is below 
that which you had somehow anticipated, 
or even that the type of job you preferred 
is n6t readily available in a suitable 
locale. The point is to get good informa
tion from reliable sources about such mat
ters before you start your job search. 
Evaluate the information and make the 
necessary adjustments to your range and 
level of expectations so as to market your 
qualifications to employers with a clear 
and realistic understanding of the market
place.
Develop effective communications 
skills. To most students,this means being, 
able to handle a job interview with tact and

ployer is the student who shows unmistakeable signs of quiet
self-confidence to get the job done. Few, if 
any, employers wish to knowingly put a 
student into a job situation that is beyond 
his or her ability to handle it. Its in the 
employers best interest for you to succeed 
in the position for which you have been 
hired. *
When an employer comments about his 
reasons for offering employment to an 
applicant, he usually cites the appropri
ateness of the students educational prepar
ation for the position in addition to 
listing personal qualities.
Tfie student who is passed over fre
quently doesnt know what he wanted to 
do, or she displayed little enthusiasm for 
the job.
In short, a successful job hunt requires 
preparation, determination and effort. The 
person who is willing to make such an 
investment and to persevere in its execu
tion will more than likely be able to enjoy 
the benefits and satisfaction that are to 
be derived from the job.J. Dennis Ryan is the Director of CMU*s 
Career Services and Placement.

Let us go then, you and I,
When Friday evening is laid upon the sky 
Like a student etherized upon a desk;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted dorms, 
The muttering coffee houses 
Of restless sighs in architect galleries 
And Tartan tables with their stale fries,
Halls that follow like a mathematical proof
of pernicious intent
to lead you to a misleading question...
Oh, do not ask, "An extension?"
Let us wander about and make our visit.
Through the halls the jocks come and go 
Talking of Joe DeMaggio.

The sulfur smog that rubs its whiskers upon the 
window-panes,
The sweet smoke that pokes its muzzle on the 
window-panes 
Barked loudly into the corners of the evening, 
Wagging around pool tables that stand in rec 
rooms,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from US 
Steel,
Slipped by the quadrangle into a mixer, 
And seeing that it was a dull April night, 
Hopped back into bed, and fell asleep.
Will there be time, will there be time 
To prepare a thesis, to meet the deadline 
Will there be time to murder or copy 
Or time for all the works and months of hands 
That lift and drop an assignment at your desk?
No time for you or time for me 
Though time yet for a thousand procrastinations 
And for a thousand visions and televisions 
Before the taking of Coke or coffee.
Through the halls the jocks come and go 
Talking of Joe DeMaggio
And indeed will there be time 
To wonder, "What's the movie?" and, "What's 
the movie?
Time to turn around and play pinball,
With a quarter in my hands
(They will say: "What a nerd he is!")
My army jacket, my collar buttoned firmly to the 
chin,
My jeans, blue and faded but asserted by a single 
patch
(They will say: "But what a nerd he is!")
Should I dare 
Disturb Miss Universe?
For a date there is time
For decisions and indecisions which a second will 
reverse.
But I've known them all before, known them 
all
Have known the mixers, concerts, and movies,
I have numbered my life with calculators;
I know the voices moaning with a moaning fall 
Beneath the stereo from a farther room.
So how should I assume?
And I have known those legs before, known them 
aHLegs that are tanned and white and bare 
(Legs that freeze you in a slobbering stare!)
Is it smoke from a bong 
That makes me so prolong?
Legs that cross with such class, or wrap about a 
chair.
And should I then theorize?
And how can I study?
Should I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow 
halls
And watched the smoke that curls from pipes 
Or homesick frosh in T-shirts, listening to stereos.
I should have been a monk
Shuffling across the floors of a silent chapel.
Ah.Mthe campus parties so loudly!
Bored by long classes,
Drunk...tired...while work malingers,
Stretched on the rug, beside you and me.
Should I, after books and pencils and paper,
Have the audacity to ask such a favor?
But though I have studied and slept, studied and 
slept,
Though I have seen my brains brought in upon a 
platter,
I am no geniusand here's no grey matter;
I have seen my chance at a 4.0 come and go,
And I have watched the omnipotent dean clutch 
my collar, artd snicker,
And in truth, I was afraid.
And really, would it have been worth it 
After the movie, the cheesecake, the coffee 
Among the silverware, among some talk of -200 
and -300 
Would it have been worth it 
To have ended the evening with a nod and a smile 
To have rolled my wash into a single ball 
And roll it towards some misleading question 
To say: "I am Garcia come from the Dead 
Come to sing, love songs I shall sing"
If one, setting a plant by her bed 
Should say: "Oh no. There is someone else.
There is someone else back home."
And really, would it have been worth it,
Would it have been worth it,
After the TV sets and the backgammon and the 
emptied halls,
After the looks, after the glasses, after the drunks 
that trail along the floor
All this, and still a bore?
It's possible I don't know what I mean!
But as if by magic an intern threw my nerves in 
patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth it
If one, watering a plant or showing off a shawl,
And turning toward a poster, should say:
"There is someone else.
There is someone else back home."
No! I am no Fonz, nor was meant to be;
Am an occasional walk-on, one that will be 
The straight man, a one-liner or two,
Help the prof; no doubt some easy tool, 
Differentiate, glad to even integrate,
Polished, careful and meticulous;
Full of theorems, but pompous;
At times, well, almost ridiculous
Almost at times full of Bull.
I will graduate...I will graduate 
I shall wear grey straight-legged slacks.
Shall I get a haircut? Do I dare the State Store? 
I shall fold my underwear and listen to Boys 
Beach
I have watched the couples smiling, each to each.
I do not think that they will party with me.
I have seen those girlish shadows 
Combing their long hair with the waves blown 
back
in Saturday lamplight upon the Gardens black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the Towers 
By nymphs wreathed with flowers, red and blue, 
Til alarm clocks wake us, and we moo.

April 11, 1978-TARTAN-page 19
Because of the overwhelming response to our 
last themeless issue, we've decided to run another 
one. The April 25 FOLIO will be a "Free for All", 
and we're looking for stories, poems, and artwork 
on any subject at all. Just leave your typed copy, 
or ink drwaings at the TARTAN box at the Skibo Desk or at the TARTAN office by Monday, April 17. And in case you're wondering, FOLIO's 
last theme (for May 2) is "Looking Back on CMU", 
so we're hoping to get some thoughts on Carnegie-Mellon before we leave it for the summer. . . 
or forever. Nostalgia can be nice.

3en & Kce JH 01 Kite Fdyiwg
by Jack McGovern
So I said to him, "How are things going?" And 
he replied, "A little crazy," which seemed to 
coincide with my assessment of "things" at the 
moment. As it happened, we were talking about 
the same general sorts of "things." Except I felt 
that "things" sometimes seem to have a natural 
proclivity for getting out of hand, and he didn't 
think that "things" were crazy enough-so much 
for Zen.
Kites have a well established niche in the saga 
of human civilization. Few people realize that 
man's fascination with kites trails back to the 
very edge of recorded history. And so it came to 
pass that Moses climbed the mountain and built a 
kite which he sent up into the clouds to receive 
The Word. Even back then people knew that 
God lived in the clouds. Moses was a practical 
man and so he carved The Message into stone to 
make a permanent record. The early Chinese used 
kites as targets for rocket practice. Recent Rus
sian history texts claim that the first sailboat was 
invented by an ancient, kite-flying Russian 
fisherman. Leonardo's early boyhood research 
into kites led to his later descriptions of gliders 
and parachutes. Wilbur and Orville built the first 
gasoline-powered kitemobile; it was a wire service 
reporter who later changed the name to airplane. 
And of course, even the briefest history of kites 
would be incomplete without mention of the 
most famous kite flyer of them all, Ben Franklin, 
that avid kite-flying devotee who in a brilliant 
flash of inspiration discovered that lightning and 
electricity were the same phenomena.
In addition to potential fame and fortune, the 
interested reader should also be aware of the 
other possible advantages of kite flying. Numer
ous enthusiasts and over-enthusiasts have claimed 
all sorts of beneficial and therepeutic effects for 
this simple pastime. Kite flying has been alleged 
to remove warts, relieve the aches and pains of 
common arthritis, and cure a wide variety of flus 
and blues. Most of these claims are supported by 
evidence of somewhat dubious authenticity, and 
none of them have ever been subjected to a 
rigorous scientific investigation. However, a sim
ple appeal to reason should convince the reader 
that kite flying is perhaps the premier therapy for 
spring fevera sort of natural judo in which the 
very forces that unite to produce this devastating 
disease are harnessed and redirected to provide 
the cure.
March winds bring April showers, May flowers, 
and lots of great kite flying weather. Unfortu
nately, in this age of over-specialization and overthe-counter sophistication, the interested novice 
is likely to be overwhelmed by the bewildering 
array of wind-powered extravaganzas that are 
.available. Any sunny, breezy afternoon in the 
Dark might find a group of engineers trying to set 
time and distance records for concrete kites, or an 
artist flying a Campbell's soup kite. And of course 
5^his pastoral scene is incomplete without some 
1ude and his mylar film, poly-hypergon funny 
uite with chrome struts, dayglo prehistoric panorsma by Frazetta, quad FM and 8-track, and flashjt'
Illustration by /r-*y * in
ing xenon running lights approved for class II 
competition by NASKITE and Underwriters' 
Laboratories. With a little inqeouitv and money 
the kite can provide on-the-spot weather reports, 
pollution indices, and traffic information. Must 
accessories this spring are said to include self-ten
sioning reels with digital readout, designer gloves 
to prevent string bum, and lightweight cleated 
shoes for exceptionally windy days.
Perhaps I should point out to you that my per
sonal esthetic values lead me to believe that if it 
costs more than two dollars or takes more than 
two hours to build, then you are probably missing 
the point: kite flying is supposed to be pleasur
able. The most common kites are the Malayan 
three-sticker, the modified diamond, and the box 
kite. All of these are relatively simple to build. 
The first two are flat kites, and they require a tail 
to enable them to fly stably. For this application, 
a good tail provides drag or resistance rather than 
just weight. My own choice is the simple box kite 
which is intrinsically stable and does not require 
any added tail.
Simplicity of construction should not, how
ever, be construed to mean that kite flying is sim
ple; kite flying is not a breeze. The flyer must 
contend with television antennae, electric power 
lines, and low flying airplanes. And in addition to 
these man-made obstacles, there are all kinds of 
natural hazards to be confronted: windless days, 
rainstorms, tornadoes, and there is always the 
nefarious kite-eating tree. Perhaps the only other 
significant hazard is the overdose. While this is 
rarely fatal, over-indulgent kite flyers have been 
known to engage in hang-gliding or degenerate 
into frisbee fanatics.
Stop. Think. In reality, you can no more fly a 
kite than you can grow a tomato. While kite 
flying is not simple, it is also not difficult. It is 
simply never under your complete control. But 
take heart. The rewards easily justify the effort, 
and on a good day you can fly forever.
At last a clear and breezy day in the park. The 
sun shines. The gods smile. Kite in one hand, 
string in the other, and you're ready to fly. If you 
should happen to feel minor tremors of self-con
sciousness or embarrassment about playing with 
kids' stuff, forget it. Remember Moses. Remem
ber Franklin. Remember history; the tide is on 
your side. No one ever watches a kite flyer any
way; everyone knows what he is doing. It's just 
another symptom of the crowded-bus syndrome. 
It is the kite that is the center of attention. So 
place your kite on the ground, and walk into the 
wind for about 25 or 50 feet as you unwind your 
string behind you. Then, holding the string firm
ly, run into the wind to get your kite airborne. 
Repeat as necessary. Coax it a little. Verbal 
assault may not get your kite up, but it gets you 
involved.
Finally you are flying. When the breeze dies 
down, you wind the string in. When the wind is 
strong, you let it out. Once aloft, kites pretty 
much fly themselves-dancing thither and yon. 
While this may seem anticlimactic, it is not; 
parental guidance is often recommended. Relax 
and enjoy your hot line with nature. Balance her 
push with your pull. Thrill to the tender tug of 
her unseen turbulent tresses. Feel time settle 
down to that playful pace: one second per second 
as the fever of spring fades away.
Close your eyes. If you can't feel her pull, then 
she must be coming toward youjust enough 
sensory stimulation to keep you from being lone
ly, not enough to distract you from being alone. 
There you stand atop four billion years of evolu
tion, facing taxes and the futureperspective at 
the end of a string. Cheaper thrills are tough to 
come by, and as history demonstrates, kite flying 
can lead to almost anything.
So if you should happen to see me wandering 
around, trailing a string behind me that seems to 
disappear in the distance, don't bother to ask. I'm 
busy flying. And what are you doing? Are you 
trapped between a test and a term paper? Are you 
caught between a crit and a canvas? Is your sap 
rising? Has spring fever struck your sensibilities? 
Whaddiya mean "things" ain't crazy enough? 
Go fly a kite!!

Spate Time At CWtU?
by Kate Bertrand
I've talked to many CMU students who have 
found unique ways to spend their spare time. One 
told me that he does his laundry in his free time. 
Another explained that she used precious spare 
minutes to shower. Yet another uses extra time to 
eat, or alternatively, to sleep.
Marsha Courtney, however, offered the most 
ingenious method for whiling away spare time at 
CMU: she stares. Yes, she sits and stares off into 
space, a glazed expression on her face and just a 
hint of drool escaping the edge of her mouth. 
Some would call this meditating, but according 
to Ms. Courtney the philosophy behind staring is 
based on not using one's mind. At all. In fact, 
the more drugged and spaced-out looking the 
starer, the more adept he is at the practice.
Staring, Marsha explained, is an extremely 
flexible spare-time activity in that it can be done 
anywhere, anytime. A comfortable locationpreferably one's own bedis helpful for beginners 
but is by no means indispensible. Soft music also 
helps; Marsha tells me that WISH sends her into a 
moronic trancie-like state almost automatically.
If a beginner is having trouble grasping the 
fundamentals of staring, Marsha suggests that he 
wait until finals week, pull a few all-nighters, and 
then try staring again. Marsha guarantees that his 
mouth will fall open, his eyes will bug out, and 
his head will fall back by itself. And after master
ing this technique, the starer should have no 
trouble using any spare moments he may find at 
CMU.

Rust Shouwuj
by Karen Joy Ravets
The veil was lifted,
All curtains pulled,
And the earth trembled 
In nakedness,
Ashamed.
She blushed roses 
And cherry buds.
A good mother.
The sun warmed her,
Green and brown tans 
Of summer.
An evil fame,
The North wind,
Took the matron 
And allowed just short visits. 
The earth's garb 
Became patchy.
Her spirit lowered.
She hid in a drape of clouds,
A dying creature.
Again winter came,
With a snow-drop cover,
To hide the land.

The Monongahela Sunrise is a new mixed drink 
which is capturing the imaginations and the pal
ates of an ever-increasing number of CMU stu
dents. It's just the thing to keep the mood mellow 
when you're watching the sun come up or go 
down over the Conservatory. The recipe was sub
mitted by its creator John Rose, and here it is.
MONONGAHELA SUNRISE
Start with a 16-ounce bottle of Orange Crush. 
Take out one good swig to make room for the 
rest of the mixture. Take one capful (3 or 4 cc) 
of green Creme de Menthe (any brand, the cheap
er the better, but it has to be green. White simply 
won't do). Tilt the Crush bottle about 10 degrees 
and carefully pour in the Creme de Menthe, al
lowing it to run slowly down the the neck of the 
bottle (on the inside). It should settle on the 
bottom of the bottle with very little mixing. If 
you have done this properly, there should be a 
green sludge on the bottom of the bottle. This 
will only last for a drink or two, as it will then 
mix with the soda (pop, if you will) and will then 
look like the Mon River after a particularly ser
ious industrial accident. For added realism, a 
drop of 3-in-1 Oil may be floated on the top, but 
this will make the Sunrise undrinkable.

Civ. E. student outstanding
by J. Michael Snizek
The Civil Engineering Department has 
selected Michael Gibbs as outstanding 
senior student. For Gibbs, who is ranked 
first in his department with an overall QPA 
of 3.9, the award is only one of many 
awards the 22 year old Cleveland resident 
has accumulated in his academic career.
Gibbs will graduate in May with a 
double major in Civil Engineering and En
gineering and Public Policy. He termed 
his academic career at CMU as interesting 
but certainly not challenging. I came to 
CMU because I was interested in the E&PP 
program. I chose Civil Engineering simply 
because I thought it was an interesting area 
to get into.
Gibbs credits his professors, particular
ly those of the Civil Engineering Depart
ment, with stimulating his interest in 
school. I must say that the Civil Engineer^ 
ing faculty is quite good They are very 
current in their thinking and attempt to 
teach very meaningful material.
The role of the engineer has changed 
in the past 10 years particularly because; of 
the increased role of computers. We are no 
longer just number crunchers. Engineers 
must be leaders in society, not recluses 
with calculators.
When Gibbs came to CMU, he promised 
himself that his course load would not 
interfere with his outside activities. As a 
4 year member of Beta Theta Pi, Gibbs 
served as buggy chairman 2 years ago and 
designed the 1977 Design Competition win
ning buggy, Echo.
I find the buggy competition to be 
very interesting. It really is an engineering 
problem. Gibbs is currently the Safety 
Chairman for the 1978 Sweepstakes, a 
position he only recently assumed.
In addition, he is Vice President of the 
Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi 
and is working 15 hours a week at the Civil 
Engineering Departments Water Resources 
Laboratory.
He plans to attend either Harvards 
Kennedy School of Government or the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business. 
Gibbs hopes to eventually direct his 
engineering skills toward public policy 
formulation with an eventual goal of 
working in a technology-related depart
ment of the government. He is also con
sidering a career with the Rand Corpora
tion or the Brookings Institute. I find it 
difficult to set goals because I constantly 
have to reassess my capabilities and inter
ests. I would like to think that I can make 
an impact, Gibbs concluded.
Edelstein named Assoc. Dean
Richard M. Edelstein, professor of the 
physics department,, has been named 
Associate Dean of MIS. Edelstein fills the
three-year vacancy of an associate dean.
Edelstein has been teaching at CMU for 
more than 15 years, and he also heads a 
particle physics research team here._______
In a recent interview. Edelstein asserted 
some of his ideas and duties as Associate 
Dean. One of the projects Im involved 
in now is increasing the number and 
quality of our graduate students. He 
explained further. The recruitment tech
niques need to be improved, and also I
think the various MIS depaitments 
could benefit from combining their recruit
ment practices. But that remains to be 
decided upon. Basically I think a more co
hesive atmosphere needs to be developed 
among the MIS departments.'
Edelstein also commented on science 
research in this country. During the 
sixties, science was pre-eminent. There was 
a big emphasis on it. and a lot of money 
was tagged for research. During the late 
sixties and seventies, the country in gen
eral had a lower concern for science, and 
consequently, research funds went down. 
I think we've hit bottom as far as that goes, 
and Im optimistic that in the future the 
conditions for science will improve.

SARC invites students, alumni
by Jean Pellegrini
Issues in Business Today,' a confer 
ence sponsored by the Student Alumni 
Relations Council (SARC) is slated for 
Tuesday, April 18, 1978.
The purpose of the Conference is to 
help interested students and alumni get a 
better understanding of the business 
world and how it affects all facets of 
society.
Through a series of discussions with 
prominent business leaders, most of whom 
are C-MU alumni, people will be exposed 
to key issues in business such as ethics, 
government relations, and economic inter
dependence between nations.
Doug Konopka, President of SARC, 
remarked, Im very proud that these 
people will be speaking at the conference. 
I have gotten to know all of them through 
my former role as Student Government 
President and I feel that they are all 
tremendous people.
The speakers and topics are: Donald 
L. Baeder, President, Hooker Chemical 
Corp., on Ethics vs. Profits; Norman
F. Parker, President and Director, Varian Associates and Maxwell H. Connan, 
President, Conart Industries, on Corp
orations and Entrcpeneurs; George 
A. Roberts, President, Teledyne Inc., on 
'Multinational Corporations**; Paula B 
Hughes, Vice President and Director, 
Thomson, McKinnon Securities, Inc. on 
The Future; and Donald C. Burnham, 
Director-Officer,  Westinghouse Electric

past and its effect on society today. He 
also mentioned the various courses on the 
Pittsburgh region as being an attempt 
to understand the urbanization, the reality 
of America.
Hayes talked about the courses offered 
by the English Deparment stressing their 
relevance to any major.
A thematic series which is expected 
to be very popular will be taught by Fred 
Sochatoff, Professor Emeritus of the 
English Deparment. The courses, "Parents 
and Children (76-204A) and Adults 
and Aging (Spring) will place emphasis 
on what it is that happens in society. 
Another course,Biblical and Mytholog
ical Background of Literature (76-20IA), 
provides an acquaintance with mythology 
which underpins our reactions as members 
of society, Hayes commented. The 
course will discuss in detail, critical as
sumptions of society, added Cohn.
The Modern Language Department 
offers yet another way of trying to 
understand various cultures and societies.
"Masterpieces of Continental Litera
tures I (82-681) and Masterpieces II 
(82-682), will be team taught by the 
Modern Language Deparment faculty. The 
objective of this year-long sequence is to 
acquaint the student with a number of 
great literary achievements from Continen
tal Europe through World War II.
Psychology courses for Fall 1978-79 
that are not listed on the University 
schedule are Behavioral Pharmacology 
(85-334, 85-734) which are excellent 
choices for Biology, Chemistry, and Premed majors.
Some courses are limited but in most cases there are no restrictions.
Schaefer, Cohn and Hayes all agreed 
that students from the other departments 
really add to the classroom.
By looking through the course descrip
tions and talking with professors or people 
from the Academic Advisory Center, some
thing interesting can be found by all.
Corp., on Government Regulations apd 
Free Enterprise.
According to Konopka, Even though 
the topic is issues in business today, the 
Conference is open to people in every de
partment on campus.
For example, the discussion entitled 
Corporations and Entrepeneurs should 
immediately signal interest to people in 
all areas; Design, Engineering, Architec
ture, English, or just about anyone in~ 
terested in starting a business or corpora
tion of their own, Konopka added.
In addition to the alumni-speakers, 
there will be approximately 100 alumni 
from every CMU department attending.
Students will realize what types of 
alumni actually graduate from CMU,"
Konopka stated.
The Conference will be limited to 200 
students. It is necessary to submit a 
registration form to the SARC office by 
Friday, April 14.
The S3.00 fee for the Conference does 
include dinner. Checks can be made pay
able to C-MU Alumni, c/o C-MU Alumni 
Office, 505 Warner Hall.
Anyone intcrsted in the Conference can 
pick up a pamphlet in Baker Hall, Skibo 
Information Desk, Hunt and b'&S Librar
ies, or the Alumni Office in Warner Hall 
You can use the registration form on the 
back of the pamphlet or the one provided 
in the Tartan ad. All forms must be re
turned bv April 14.
Summer jobs
Work-study jobs offered
by Andrew L. Ragan
The Office of Financial Aid announced 
job opportunities which might be of value 
to students looking for summer employ
ment. According to Libby Fonseca, Assis
tant Director of Financial Aid, in charge 
of work-study, The Financial Aid office 
has enough Federal dollars to have a fairly 
large summer work-study program.
Any CMU student with demonstrated 
financial need can choose from a wide 
variety of summer jobs here on campus or 
almost anywhere in Pennsylvania, provided 
that the student is within commuting dis
tance of the job. Through a program spon
sored by the PHEAA (Pennsylvania 
Higher Education Assistance Agency, in 
conjunction with CMU and non-profit or
ganizations throughout Pennsylvania, a 
student can acquire work-study summer 
employment in a variety of interesting 
fields. Some of the jobs include positions 
in accounting, theatre, social work, arts 
and crafts, athletics, legal assistance, bus
iness administration, agriculture educa
tion, and many others. Ms. Fonseca points 
out that in her experience with the pro
gram, all students applying have been 
granted their first job preference.
The summer work-study program is a 
means for students to earn the self-help 
portions of their financial aid packages 
or even work off loans in a constructive^ 
and educational way. Ms. Fonseca empha
sizes that the major purpose of this program is to provide a way for students to 
pay for their schooling. Students are 
expected to understand that they are to 
save a substantial portion of their summer 
earnings for school-related expenses.
The work-study awards differ with each 
student. They do not jeopardize grants or 
scholarship money unless the student 
exceeds his work-study award allotment. 
In addition, students who work during the 
summer, will not necessarily lose their 
allocation of work-study funds for the next 
semester. Although the work-study award 
for next semester could be smaller, Ms. 
Fonseca maintains that adjustments are 
possible and that some form of work 
study is usually available.
Financial Aid information (7778 or 
7879 PCS form is required) will help 
in determining a students eligibility for 
the program.
A list of job descriptions and summer 
openings will be made available to eligible 
and interested students. Also, the list of 
organizations diroughout Pennsylvania 
who have contracted with PHEAA to hire 
work study students is available in the 
Financial Aid Office.
It is essential that students arrange tor 
appointments with Ms. Fonseca as soon as 
possible. Students who are interested in 
the program are advised to obtain an ap
plication form from the Financial Aid 
Office.
Keep off the grass
The following is a message to all stu
dents from Earle R. Swank, Dean of 
Student Affairs, concerning the res
toration of the Cut and the Fine Arts 
lawn:
In anticipation of Commencement on 
May 15 when the University honors 
graduates and their parents, the staff of 
Physical Plant will be working to try to 
reestablish a healthy stand of grass on the 
Cut and on the Fine Arts lawn. The past 
winter has been particularly hard on the 
grass because of the heavy snow cover and 
problems widi snow mold. Effective 
immediately Physical Plant will be working 
at conditioning the lawns trying to reseed 
areas. -
The University asks that students refrain 
from active sports on the Cut and on the 
Fine Arts lawn until after Commencement. 
The Mall between Baker and Doherty may 
be used as an alternate play area for those 
activities which traditionally have been 
taking place on the Cut.
Security officers have been instructed to 
enforce the ban on playing on the Cut and 
Fine Arts lawn. I would appreciate the 
cooperation of all students in this effort 
to restore the campus lawns to as attract
ive a state as possible in time for Com
mencement.
Another statistic
Professor Joseph B. Kadane, Head of 
the Statistics Department, has been ap
pointed to the Census Advisory Com
mittee of the American Statistical As
sociation as was announced by Manuel 
D. Plotkin, Director of the Bureau of 
the Census, U.S. Department of Com
merce.
The Committee, whose members serve 
on a rotating basis, advises the Bureau 
on its programs as a whole. It considers 
priority issues and the planning of cen
suses, examines guiding principles and 
advises on questions of policy and pro
cedures. The committee also responds 
to Bureau requests for opinions con
cerning its operations.
Next year, Professor Kadane will be 
on a leave of absence. J. Paul Lehoczky, 
Associate Professor of Statistics, will 
serve as Acting Head of the* Statistics 
Department.________________________
Pervasion course canceled
continued from page 1
partment Head, Arthur Eastman, Steinberg 
approved the concept of the course. I 
approved the course because I thought it 
gave that applied edge we needed. It does 
give the student an advantage, no question. 
I think the Departments objections stem 
from the fact that the material might be 
considered too narrow in its scope. Perhaps 
if it were broadened to include the history 
in the change of language or of semantics, 
the objections might evaporate.
Students who have taken the coursc are 
almost unanimous in their support of Gold
man.
Lisa Klepper, a self defined Advertis
ing major, finds the course absolutely in
valuable" in her preperation for the future. 
The material is not that easy at all. A lot 
of time and effort goes into the weekly as
signments. He knows if you just dashed off 
something the night before/* She conclud
ed, Professor Goldman's easy-going man
ner, and thoughful comments give the class 
a very friendly atmosphere. He really cares 
about his students and wants to see them 
succeed. :
Another student, junior Design major
Lisa Lien, finds the course extremely rele
vant to her Design courses* Designers need 
marketable skills and advertising is a per
fect outlet. I think it would be an awful 
mistake to cancel this course.,
Indeed, Goldman reports that in the 
three year history of the course, nearly 20 
former students have gone into the adverti
sing field. *I doubt if any coursc in the 
department can match that kind of place
ment. In fact, Mary Ann Schaeffer, one of 
his ex-students is presently working at 
Goldmans former agency. According to 
Goldman, She was just as good as any
body when she walked in the door 
Allowing two students a semester to 
intern at his agency, Goldman has always 
taken a strong interest in his students. He 
finds the class work to be extremely pro
fessional. lie remarked, Just last week I 
had a professional radio announcer come 
into class to read some of the class work. 
Afterwards he said that 90^ of the work 
in the class was better than so-called pro
fessional's work. He had no reason to say 
that. I think thats some compliment to 
the kids.
As for charges that he is too liberal in 
his grading Goldman states, In the real
wo. Id, if you write 10 ads and one a win
ner and works, youre a hero. Here, if a 
student writes I really good ad, I have to 
reward him,*' He continues, No one from 
the department has ever audited my class 
and I doubt if there is anyone else in the 
department qualified to teach this class. No 
one has the insight, experience, and real 
world knowledge of advertising like I 
have.
Goldman is optimistic about the future 
of the course. The new head, Dick Young, 
will probably arive in July and Im hopeful 
that he will review the matter. I think that 
the number of students who have shown 
their support for me, past and present, as 
well as the extremely relevant nature of the 
material will be enough to override any 
other considerations. !
The dilemma facing the new English 
Department Head will be whether the tra
ditionally oriented curriculum can support 
the very useful if not availt garde Art of 
Persuasion" course. As one H&SS student 
proclaimed.We cant get a job to begin 
with, they lake away Music Education in 
Fine Arts and now they want to take away 
this advertising course. What do they want 
us to do, slay in school forever?"

Reputation precedes Renaissance
by F.F.B.
Originally, this article was intended to 
introduce Renaissance to the CMU campus 
in anticipation of their concert April 13 in 
Carnegie Music Hall at 8:00 PM. But after 
most of the tickets for the concert disap
peared the morning they went on sale, it 
appears Renaissances reputation preceded 
them and they need no basic introduction.
Their reputation is well-deserved. Based 
on their lead singer with the golden voice, 
Annie Haslam, and their style in traditional 
music, Renaissance produces music which 
is unmatched in both style and sound.
Renaissance does not have the reputa
tion of a Top Forty group because they re
fuse to record cuts which could be released 
as singles. They turn every song into a per
formance, and their albums are therefore 
more unified and flowing. Their style, 
strictly geared for long-playing albums, 
places them in the minority of groups who 
consider how the album as a unit will 
sound. The upshot, of couse, is that tenminute songs are rarely given air-play on 
Top Forty stations. Renaissances complex 
songs, being abstract, do not Fit into the 
usual hummable type of song heard on 
most singles. (See Pink Floyd for further 
reference.) Quite simply, Renaissance is 
not a group for everybody. They are a 
sophisticated and polished group, and like 
early Fleetwood Mac, have their own de
voted following.
Renaissance uses classical and folk 
music beautifully in their songs. Usually 
building upon the basic melody of the tra
ditional song, they weave a more modem 
tune about it to produce a work of art. 
Anyone who has a knowledge of Russian 
folk music, or seen Dr. Zhivago or Potemkin 
will immediately recognize many of Re
naissances songs.
The real advantage is that Renaissance 
has the talent to do such music, and do it 
well. The groups five members all know 
what they can contribute and do it well. 
John Tout plays the keyboards in a way 
that will make the music major drool. His 
power on the piano brings out the force
and personality of the songs. Instrumentally the group is definitely centered around 
Touts keyboards. Terence Sullivan adds 
his talents on the drums and percussion.
While in general, Terence takes a back seat 
to Annies voice, he does have several drum 
soloes that would make Ron Bushy (Iron 
Butterfly) stand up and take notice. Of 
equal quality, Jon Camp adds his bass to 
the classical sound of the group.
On stage, though, the group centers around Annie Haslam and Michael Dunsford. 
Annie with her voice and beauty captivates
the audiences attention; she is a powerful 
singer with an unbelievable range. When 
she walks out on stage, the audience ex
pects an unforgettable experience. Michael 
Dunsford is the underlying central figure 
in Renaissance, having written or helped to 
write almost all of the groups songs, and 
they are their own tribute. He not only 
knows how to write songs, but with his 
guitar he knows how to make them sound 
like they should.
Renaissance has released six albums; 
Prologue, Ashes are Burning, Turn of the 
Cards, Schererazade, Live at Carnegie Hall, 
and last years release, Novella In addition, 
Annie has recorded a solo album this year, 
Annie in Wonderland
Renaissance has a long and broad list of 
hits which they can choose from to per
form. There is the titletrack from Prologue 
and Ashes are Burning. Can You Understand 
is also off Ashes. From Turn of the Cards, 
in addition to their most well-known tune, 
Mother Russia, there is Running Hard, 
Black Flame, and Things I Dont Under
stand. In addition to the long classical ballad 
of Scherezade from Schererazade, there is 
also Ocean Gypsy. Midas Man is their latest 
hit off Novella, the whole album is very 
solid. Their live album is amazingly wellrecorded, and gives a good overview of the 
group.
If youre lucky enough to have a ticket, 
prepare for a concert youll never forget. 
And thank the Lord that it wont be held 
in the gymnasium this year. It wouldve 
been like watching the Pittsburgh Ballet in 
2210.
Ballet brings diverse dances
A Dance Review
Dances: Signatures, Grosse Fugue, 
Symphony in C 
Company: Pennsylvania Ballet
by Knox Uguccioni
The Pennsylvania Ballet presented a var
iety of works in their recent Pittsburgh per
formances. Their newest premiere was Sig
natures, choreographed by artistic director 
Benjamin Harkarvy. Conceptually this 
work was unique: a dance which intro
duced the dancers in roles designed specifi
cally for their personalities and talents. Un
fortunately the dance was merely a simplis
tic exploration of the conceptthirty dan
cers doing thirty dances. Those dances 
were often awkward and rough: a series of 
spectacular movements with tenuous con
necting phrases. The steps were arbitrarily 
connected and didnt always follow each 
other. Occasionally the roles intertwined 
and began to complement each other as 
parts of a larger pattern, but the sequence 
would invariably stop abrupdy and change 
to another.
The dance was lengthy and soon became 
boring since there was no overall structure 
to relate the dances and connect them into 
a unified whole. This should have been an
all-encompassing work, perhaps, beginning 
in a structured, classical way and then ex
ploring dance through a progression to an 
abstract modem idiom. Each dancer would 
still have their own role, but one that log
ically related to all the others. 
The score was abstract and modern for 
the most part, with each section composed 
for a particular dancer. Because the music 
was so abstract it was difficult to distin
guish between the section and link them to 
the appropriate dancer. Only at the end did 
tfie music become connected and flow 
from one movement to another. The cos
tumes were solid colors, in a complete 
range of rainbow-bright hues. They were 
helpful in grouping dancers and clarifying 
relationships between the separate move
ments by complementing or contrasting.
Signatures has the potential to be a vital 
exploration of dance and dancers, provid
ing it has a logical, sequential structure. 
Hopefully this version is the first step in 
that exploration, not the last.
Beethovens Grosse Fugue was the 
inspiration for a ballet of the same name 
by Hans Van Manen. The ballet has no 
story, but is the examination of relation
ships between men and women within the 
context of the music. Four men and four
women dance their physical and sexual 
relationships, responding to the changing 
tension and power of the music. The dance 
begins as a display of maleness and macho 
in a powerful, stylized series of move
ments. The women parody the mens 
attitude and their relationships change and 
build to an intense physical interaction. 
The expressionistic quality was heightened 
by the lighting which was well designed 
and sensitive to the changes in attitude 
throughout the dance. All eight dancers 
were excellent; handling all of the move
ments with ease and giving them an intense 
spiritual quality.
Their last work was the purely classical 
Symphony In C choreographed by George 
Balanchine. Like Grosse Fugue, the ballet 
reflects and responds to the score, but it 
does this by exploring themes in the same
way that music does. In each of the four 
movements the theme is established by the 
principal dancers and then is repeated by 
the demi-soloists and finally by the corps 
de ballet. Slight variations occur as the 
theme is picked up by each group of dan
cers and is repeated and expanded. Every 
dancer was excellent and they easily exe
cuted Balanchines intricate choreography. 
Although the Pennsylvania Ballet has the 
-traditional hierarchy of dancers used in this 
ballet, each is a talented and exciting dan
cer. They are polished performers, indivi
dually and collectively.
As regulars in the Dance Council season, 
the Pennsylvania Ballet brings many diverse 
dances to Pittsburgh each year. Their reper
toire delights the audience time and again 
and wj^h their professional caliber, they are 
sure to be here for a long time to come.
Gallery opening slated
A retrospective exhibit illustrating the 
versatile career of the late Richard I. Felver, former Professor of Design at CarnegieMellon University, will be held April 11-23 
to mark the official opening of the Univer
sitys new design department gallery.
The show, entitled Looking Back: Rich
ard I. Felver, will also feature products 
such as cookware, a smoke detector, and a 
wind gauge designed by Felver as well as 
photos, blueprints, and models of his other 
{ industrial design projects, ranging from a 
stove and an electric hospital bed to railroad instrument casings. Felvers sketch
books, letters, professional articles, and 
other memorabilia from his 40-year associ
ation, as student and teacher, with CMU 
will also be on display. CMU student Mike 
Salemi, coordinator for the show, explains 
that although many of the productsEelver 
designed are still in production today, his 
students will be seeing them for the first 
time at the exhibition. He was a modest 
man and didnt want to influence his stu
dents with his own designs, Salemi says, 
so he simply never showed any.

Graduating from college is usually a 
serious time of proclaiming adulthood. 
But according to Douglas Mintmier, pre
vious corporate recruiter and present 
placement director at Carnegie-Mellons 
Graduate School of Industrial Administra
tion, its time to start playing gamesspecifically the employment game which 
happens to be one of the most important 
of a lifetime.
In his most recent book, The Employ

Mintmier gives help to todays job seeking 
population. From originally selecting a 
career to finally selecting the best offer, 
Mintmier explains how each advance 
move plays an important role in finding 
and acquiring the most appropriate and 
enjoyable career. The basis for his book 
is the comparison he makes between job 
hunting and playing a game. Job hunting 
like chess, is a game of strategy, like 
poker, a game of chance, and like football, 
a game of implementation. By planning 
moves, considering alternatives, and dealing 
with consequences, anyone should be able 
to be happy and feel professionally fulfill
ed within the career they seek.
By using this past experience and 
knowledge lie is able to explain what em
ployers arc particularly searching for and 
what they notice about prospective em
ployees. Since employers are human, their 
decisions,whcthcr conscious or subconcious arc many times based on personal
">ias and/or personal intuitions. Therefore,
die trick of the game is to originally get on 
the good sideof the employer and stay 
there even if the offer must be refused. 
To achieve that certain personal relation
ship, Mintmier starts with resumes and 
works his way through acceptance letters 
devoting on his way an entire chapter of 
the book to the interview, the most com
mon and important method used to form
ulate opinions of job candidatesIn it, 
he gives likely questions to be asked and 
what, in reality, is meant by them. Also 
how appearance, behavior and spark 
a mixture of ability, exciting personality 
and apparent confidencecan personally 
affect an employer, are discussed.
Through a simple and straighforward 
writing style, Mintmier stresses the simple 
and straighforward step by step game plan. 
This book is written clearly and totally 
covers every aspect of job finding :By 
writing the book in second person, the 
author creates a very informal rapport with 
his reader making him feel almost like one 
of the GS1A students he places daily. He 
keeps humor in the book in attempt to 
lighten the usually frantic or depressive 
obsession that accompanies job hunting 
and overall comes across as an advisor who 
really cares about the advice seekers 
success.
With the job market as it is today, the 
presence of books such as The Employ
ment Game Where Do You Fit? can do 
nothing less than help. It is not enough 
now to merely graudate from a reputable 
institution with a high QPA Since there
are so many talented graduates every year 
the competition for jobs has increased,, 
It has become necessary for job seekers to 
pool their resources, plan a strategy, and 
play The Employment Game.
Poets become friends
A Poetry Review 
Poets: Dannie Abse and 
Richard Selzer 
Sponsor: International Poetry Forum
by Joan Eivitski
The International Poetry Forum pre
sented Doctors Dannie Abse and Richard 
Selzer for its final program. The choice of 
poets and format resulted in one of the 
best readings of the series.
Dr. T.S. Danowski, who introduced the 
poets, opened by posing a question: Why 
do physicians write poetry? Several sug
gestions were put forth by him such as: 
a sense of debt; to leave something for 
posterity, therapy to relieve tension; 
because the opportunity is there; and an 
outcry against fate. But in the case of
Dannie Abse and Richard Selzer, Id like to 
propose another reason: theyre good at it.
Though both are physician and poet, 
the similarity basically ends there. 'Richard 
Selzer calls upon his work for subject 
matter far more directly, commenting that 
I would have nothing to say if I were not 
a doctor. I'd develop impotency of the 
pen. Dannie Abse, even though he thinks 
it would be a waste if a doctor never used 
his medical experiences, feels he doesnt 
have to write about his work.
In opening the program, Richard Selzer 
gave his own response to the initial 
question. He said, The poet is the only 
true doctor. Instead of physical care, a 
poem offers a kind of healing through its 
moment of revelation.
His poems are basically narrative of his 
daily work. Saying he often writes between 
operations, he confesses its been kiddingly 
alluded that sometimes I write during my 
operations. This results in many of his 
images dealing with body parts and func
tions, blood, sickness, blood, medicine, and 
blood. Even with massive references to 
slaughter, bleeding and death, Selzers 
poems dont come across especially grue
some, but rather as dealing with aspects of 
life in a most honest manner.
Dannie Abse writes about medicine too 
. . . when chance deems it so. This may be 
due to his view that medical poems on a 
whole tend to be rather grim. One 
exception is a poem of his own creation, 
where he amusingly diagnoses fairy tale 
and fictional characters. More often hisSALE

poetry takes the everyday occurrences that 
we all encounter and gives a high-witted 
outlook to it.
He says his poems tend to be auto
biographical, whereas his plays are written 
more to make social statements. Realizing 
limitations, Dr. Abse is still adamant that 
theres a time for the economy of poetry 
and a time for the expanse of plays and 
essays.
A question and answer period was 
opened up after the reading to those in the 
audience who wished to stay. Hopefully 
this will become a regular feature of all
readings during next years Poetry Forum. 
It was not only entertaining, but highly 
informative, affording the audience with 
the chance to begin to know the poets as 
people and even friends.

Merry Men surprise
A Play Review 
Play: Woodwind 
Producer: Scotch and Soda
by Russ Militello
With tiie current trend of remakes, I 
guess that it is only appropriate that some
one do a remake of the Robin Hood leg
end. Thats what the students in Scotch 
and Soda have done with their present 
production of Woodwind. Taking the basic 
story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, 
the authors have added music to enhance 
the nearly trite plot. The music is*a blend 
of rock and folk and, although I wouldn't 
have expected it, complements the story 
line very nicely.
Most everyone is familiar with the basic 
story line, needing little explanation. The 
production itself is important.
My first reaction as 1 entered the ball
room was the realization that I was not go
ing to see a Broadway production. Being a 
student organization, they do not have an 
excess of funds available to them. So, in 
terms of scenery and costumes I prepared 
myself for something amateurish in ap
pearance, but functional in nature. When 
they began the overture, I prepared myself 
for something high-schoolish: full of exag
geration and camp. But I was pleasantly 
surprised when the action began.
This being a new approach to an old 
story, 1 looked forward to seeing what 
imaginative things would be done with this 
most interesting of folklore tales. The in
novations began with the introduction of 
the sexy stooges. Although I am uncertain 
of their exact purpose, they served as com
ic relief and had very nice singing voices.
Allan A. Dale was another surprise, normal
ly being a male role. The role was played 
more than adequately, but her voice was 
often lost in a barrage of music or the poor 
acoustics of the ballroom.
The actor who played Robin Hood ac
tually looked the way that I expected him 
to looktights and all! Displaying above 
average acting abilities and an outstanding 
singing voice, he was very near to the epit
ome of Robin Hood. At least as close as 
he could have come in this production. 
Next came the Sheriff of Nottingham. 
Good Lord, what had they done to him?!! 
Looking like a lopsided Marquis de Sade, I 
was at first turned off by the overt camp 
and sexual innuendoes. However, as time 
went on. this receded somewhat and was 
displaced by the fact that the actor did ir 
fact have talent. The characters of Little 
John and the Bishop were functional. Lit
tle John has a very nice singing voice, and 
handled his songs very well. The bishop 
didn't have the most demanding lines to 
work with, but foi the most part he was 
funny and did liavo his moments.
I was surprised that some of the minor 
characters had the funniest lines. Deacon 
number I nearly stole the show each time 
he was on stage (despite the loss of his 
nose), and I wondered if the audience's at
tention could have been directed more to
wards the major characters. The character 
of King Richard was perhaps the most developed characterization in the production. 
His singing voice was very good, managing 
to be heard above the music where some ot 
the others failed.
Now for the moment that 1 had been 
waiting for, the introduction of Robin to 
Maid Marion. This is (or should be) one of 
the most important scenes in the play. Al
though little was done in the dialogue, 
much was shown in the music. The actress 
playing Marion made the most of her late 
entrance into the production, capturing the 
audiences attention immediately. This was 
also the first indication that the play was 
not going to be entirely comedic. Marion 
further garnered attention by displaying a 
lovely and versatile singing voice as well as 
acting ability. She had the power to make 
herself heard above the often overwhelm
ing music, quite surprising for such a small 
girl.
The remainder of the cast performed 
their various parts without any excessive 
ornamentation. They worked off each oth
er very well, although there were some 
spots where they appeared to wander around the stage rather aimlessly and with
out purpose.
The music showed much imagination 
and talent. Most of the songs were well 
written and performed. Highlighting the 
musical numbers were The Waltz (which al
so showed excellent choreography). Some
thing More, Ode to the Hick, Its So Hard, 
The Kings Plan (another song displaying 
outstanding choreogiaphy), and If I Have 
You. The many fine songs was perhaps the 
most delightful surprise for me, not ama
teurish at all.
The choreography was also very profes
sional and, although no choreographer is 
credited, whoever it is should be congratu
lated.
Overall, the play was a pleasant surprise. 
There are some trouble spots and things 
that were rather pointless. For instance, 
the music from the orchestra drowns out 
most of the voices. This could be corrected 
very easily depending on who (or what) is 
at fault, but different microphone place
ment and toning down the orchestra 
couldn't hurt. The musicians played ade
quately. but could have used some dynam
ic changes'to accompany the mood and to 
not overpower.
Fnjoying the play, I found it a nice di
version for people who think there isnt 
much entertainment offered on campus. 
Dont look for an excessive amount of 
depth o^ social significance, but see it for 
an entertaining, well directed production. 
It's a pleasant surprise.
The following is a portion of the review the TARTAN ran of Woodwind when it was originally produced in 1973.
/ attended an energetic rehearsal of the production last week, and /m 
was all so optomistic and happy and encouraging. The whole produc-1 
tion seemsto be charged up with the healthy excitement of a cooperative 
collaboration of creative efforts. ... A typical rehearsal, but wonderfully 
professional looking. The snatches of music Ive heard sound very unu
sual; a combination of rock, Showtune-selJ-it-baby, and easy-going pop. 
Yochum described the book as being tragedy with a lot of laughs, 
which is a new one on me. . .
/ guess the nicest thing about the dynamism and talent of Scotch and 
Soda is the fact that none of the participants are in drama. Mark Yochum 
is a senior history major, John Grefensette is a Junior majoring in Math, 
and Bruce Murray is a freshman musician.
Different views expressed
by Joan Livitski
A difference of opinion isn't that what 
makes horse races? Well it also makes for 
variety in stage performance, or at least 
this has been the experience of many in
volved with Scotch and Soda.
Being a revival. I was curious as to if and 
how Woodwind had changed from its orig
inal interpretation back in ll)73. So I 
sought out this year's director. Monty 
Karp, and cast members; talked with the 
playwrights, of whom Mark Yochum was 
also the original director, who came to 
this years opening night performance: and 
then compared viAvs,. As luck would have 
it, 1 was also able to stumble upon a cast 
member, Betsey Lynn, who was in both 
productions. All my information resulted 
in a revelation the caliber that might be ex
perienced in Sherwood Forest.
There were additions and deletions ol> 
vious to everyone: inclusion of songs, a 
death, a lot more dancing, more elaborate 
costumes and scenery; and the ommitance 
of many orchestra members.
The show's innovators. John Grefenstette, Bruce Murray and John Yochum, 
were a bit reserved in their judgment, or 
maybe they were just in awe. Bruce com
mented that a different slant was taken 
with the production the second time around. confirmed by Ms. Lynn. All three 
conceded that it was an experience to 
see 'someone else interpret what they had 
written.
The show got its inspiration after Bruce 
and John did a production of Jesus Christ 
Superstar and decided they'd give their im
aginations a try at writing a show them
selves. The songs came first, and all agreed 
that the singing was much better than we 
had four years ag" Though Bruce, who 
had done much of the composing, felt the 
music lost a lot. Of course, they had a 
twenty-two piece orchestra, and this pro
duction has a good, but more reduced band
But though the original sported a larger 
orchestra, the present production makes up 
in scenery and costumes. They had a tree; 
we had a coat rack. commented Mark. Of 
course, one must take into account the dif
ferences in their budgets estimated cost 
lor the original was about $500. while this 
production ran. . . well, let's just say they 
had a far richer purse.
The writers saw a difference in relation
ships between some of the characters, especiall> that of the King and Sheriff. Originall) the King had complete control, but 
in the present version we see the Sheriff
getting his way.
One area of extra dimension that this 
years production has, that all three writers 
consented theirs lacked, was the yse of twt 
scantily clad females in the role of Wat and 
Will. The men gave their approval, saying 
they could have gone even further in that 
direction.
Ms. Lynn elaborated on more of the 
productions' differences for me. She saw a 
diversification in the direction of many ma
jor characters from one production to the 
other, especially in the relationship bet
ween Robin and Maid Marion, tven just in
the character of Marion herself, the original 
was portrayed as more a part of the castle 
life, whereas now shes more like one of 
the forest people in a nice dress.
Amusingly enough, with the vast in
crease in dance numbers (as Bruce relatedwe had movement as opposed to dan
cing), the one choreographed scene from 
the original is now done with no dancing
Reasons for these differences, according 
to Ms. Lynn, stenr largely from the fact 
 that the play was originally done in the 
Fall and geared towards a small, intimate 
audience. Theres a different emphasis; this 
year's production, from conception, was a 
bigger production. A lot Ijad to do with it 
being run during Spring Carnival. Students 
are up and happy and looking for spectacu
lar entertainment, nothing subdued. Hence 
the increase in dance numbers. As Ms. 
Lynn put it. If people came to a musical 
production, they'd be disappointed if there 
was no dancing.
It was a big hit for us, was Bruces 
comment, and I think it can well be a suc
cess for this years cast as well. The writers 
felt it made them what they are today: 
Bruce a (as he describes, well known and 
famous) local musician on his way to 
graduate school at Yale in music, Mark a 
lawyer in Pittsburgh; and John a computer 
science graduate student at Pitt.
When asked if they ever longed to go 
back to writing musicals, they disclosed 
that they're working on musical versions of 
the sinking of the Titanic and the assassina
tion of Lincoln. They quickly said they 
were kidding, but after having talked with 
them tor a while. I'm not quite sure. Seri
ously though, they said that just prior to 
being approached by the Scotch and Soda 
staff, they had toyed with the idea of reviv
ing Woodwind themselves. It would be in
teresting if they did produce it again, to see 
if their interpretation changed any with the 
span of time. ___________________

Art innovative symbol discovered
by Fyrth Reckseit
The Department of Design was honored 
to host as their speaker last Wednesday 
jvening, Thomas Geismar, partner of 
Chermayeff & Geismar Associates, a New 
[York based design firm, active in a broad 
[range of activities. Mr. Geismars firm is 
[involved with trademark and corporate 
design, book design, packaging, promotion, 
[advertising, architechtural graphics and 
[exhibition design.
In his lecture to the audience, Mr. 
IGeismar defined design, We dont deal 
[with making art, we are solving other 
[peoples problems in a creative and imag
inative way. Mr. Geismar explained that 
answers to his design problems are solved
with application of design principles as 
opposed to styles. Mr. Geismar presented 
slides of his firms work to demonstrate 
ways of finding design solutions. He 
suggests these ideas to be basic and 
grouped, i.e. according to use of scale, 
pattern, repetition and type, showing 
exactly how basic these ideas are by arran
ging an introduction to each group. The 
introduction to each group included slides 
representing non-artisans attempts to con
vey important messages having to do with 
effectiveness or ineffectiveness.
To compare the related slides, Mr. 
Geismar then showed us his own com
panys work. In contrast to amateurly 
crafted work by a gas station attendant
or roadside farmer, he demonstrated out
standing corporate identification systems 
Chermayeff and Geismar Associates devel
oped for Mobil Oil, Pan American, Burling
ton Industries, Chase Manhattan Bank, and 
Seatrain Lines. As design consultants to 
some of the United States major corpora
tions, Chermayeff and Geismars work is 
characteristically and uncompromisingly 
crisp, clear, and immaculate. His company 
is able to convince Seatrain Lines to 
consistently clean or replace their freight 
cars to maintain the white, unfaded fresh
ness associated with Seatrains corporate 
identity. He also showed slides of the 
exhibition they designed (as partners of the 
Boston based architect firm, Cambridge
Seven) for the United States Pavilion at 
Expo 67 in Montreal. With other design
ers and architects they were also respon
sible for all design aspects of the United 
States Pavilion, Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan.
Thomas Geismar, also Director of the 
American Institute of Graphic Arts, has 
won numerous awards testifying to his 
professional success and to recognition 
from his colleagues.
The Department of Design will present 
for its final Spring Lecture, Arthur Pulos 
from Syracuse University. Mr. Pulos 
will speak on the American Design Ethic. 
The lecture will be held on Wednesday 
evening, April 19 at 8 PM in Science Hall 
7500 and is Tree and open to the public.
Colson searches peace
Book Review 
took: Born Again 
Author: Charles Colson 
ublisher: Bantam
by Paul Henderson 
In Born Again, Charles Colson attempts 
|to write his almost mandatory Watergate 
[book under the cover of his religious con
version. I doubt if anyone was fooled.
Colson starts his book by briefly re
counting his early years of serving the 
President, his appointment as Special 
[Counsel, his position as Nixons campaign 
[manager in 1972, etc., and then quickly 
[launches into the Watergate period.
Colson denies any involvement with the 
I break-in or cover-up. He casts an all-inclu
sive statement of innocence over anything 
connected with Watergate. He is also 
fiercely loyal to Nixon, and strongly 
(counters John Deans claims that Nixon
Lew of the break-in and cover-up.Thus Colson answers tfte cnarges ot
[Watergate very simply, and doesnt reveal 
[any startling new facts. But he also de
scribes, often in great detail, the behindthe-scenes activities of the government 
during this time of crisis. His descriptions 
of high powered officials fonning poli
cies in an attempt to turn the tide of 
public opinion, of the intricate power 
plays within the White House; all give the reader a startling insight into the 
political scene.
Throughout the book, Colson portrays 
himself as being totally innocent, and 
wrongly suffering because of the false
charges brought against him. Almost at 
the point of a nervous breakdown, Colson 
is saved by Tom Phillips, President of 
Rayethon Corporatioh, who is a zealous 
Christian. Phillips shows Colson the way to 
Christ, Colson follows it, and is saved. 
After this religious rebirth, Colsons life 
drastically changes, and he tells how he 
is at peace with himself and his world. 
Watergate no longer troubles him, and he 
doesnt attempt to defend himself. His life 
is now guided by the saying: Better to fail 
in a cause that will ultimately succeed, 
than to succeed in a cause that will ulti
mately fail.
Many more chapters are devoted to 
Colsons rebirth but all seem to start in a 
religious tone, and then quickly revert back 
to Watergate. The two subjects are so 
twined, and unrelated, that the chapters 
become tiresome reading. I wonder what 
the purpose of the book was, to tell of 
the rebirth or of Watergate. The title sug
gests the former, the contents the latter..
Thus the book is one of dual purposes 
and fails because of it. Colson portrays 
himself as lily white and one who is unjust
ly suffering at the hands of the courts, the 
public, and especially the press. He finds 
solace in Christ, and leaves the cares of 
Watergate behind. He goes to prison as 
the martyr of Watergate, and the reader 
gets the feeling that Colson is trying to 
gain some pity. But Colson fails again. 
He may be reborn and have made peace 
with Christ, but peace with the nation is 
not attained.

"Hot Wax" turns cold
A Film Review
Film: American Hot Wax
Director: Floyd Mutrux
by Lennie Matjasko
While American Hot Wax is certainly 
as American as a slug in a parking meter, 
and definitely as shapeless as a mass of 
melted wax, it is unmistakenly not-so-hot. 
In fact, if freezing is lousy, then this movie 
reaches temperatures far below zero.
The movie is based on the eternally 
attractive true story-juiced up, of 
course, in enterprising American fashion. 
Unfortunately, even juiced up, this true 
story leaves much to be desired. American 
Hot Wax is about the career of Alan Freed, 
a New York disc jockey in the 1950s 
who, even at the risk of a tisk-tisk from his 
boss and harrassment from the traditional 
record industry, continues to play and proGIRLS...............ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A SUM

mote rock n roll. What a heroone of the 
great American martyrs. Or at least thats 
what were supposed to think when people 
tell Freed things like, Youre way ahead 
of the game or I never had anything til 
I found the music. We even catch Freed 
crying over his old, lonely dad in Akron, 
Ohio, and allowing the pubescent president 
of the James Dean Fan Club into the 
WROL studio on the anniversary of Deans 
death. Its all supposed to be so moving. 
But it isnt.
American Hot Wax is simply a movie 
for those afflicted with a bad case of 50s 
nostalgia. The story of Alan Freed is slop
pily told, so sloppily that I dont believe 
it and, worse, dont care. The story is 
shoved to the wayside by bra-stuffing, 
ponytailed bobby-soxers screaming at the 
sight of Freed, and by a group of four 
Black young men (one of whom looks to 
be pushing forty) complete with straight
ened hair who keep trailing at Freeds 
heels singing a cappella harmony in hopes 
of (what else) getting an audition. Yes, the 
costumes and the music are all very authentic-looking. Freed himself wears a madras 
sports coat throughout the movie.
But, though the movie did appeal to 
the bubble gum crackers sitting in front of 
me, American Hot Wax did not appeal to 
me. Even if I were a fifties fanatic interes
ted only in fifties music, the clumsy, all 
too-obvious manner in which the ponytails 
and shooby-doos were presented would 
have repulsed me. In a word, I hated the 
movie. And, in another few words, Im 
just glad I didnt have to pay to see it

Woolf seduces audience
A Play Review
Play: Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf 
Producer: Camelot Productions
by Karen Locitzer
Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf, showing 
at the Plaza Theatre in Bloomfield, is a 
terrifying play. It is about a couple who 
need to torture each other as part of 
their love for one another. By now, 
most of us know that the world is not 
a pretty place, and still, the malicious 
venom with which Martha and George 
tear at each other can poison even 
a cynics views on love and marriage.
The play opens as Martha and George, 
who hav^ just arrived home from a party, 
snipe at each other in what turns out 
to be an amiable fashion. Martha springs
the news that there are guests coming
and even if it is two in the morning,
her father told her to be nice to them.
And her father is president of the college 
where George teaches. For a while after 
the guests arrive, there is a truce between 
Martha and her husband while they take 
simple pot shots at each other, but the 
battle rapidly escalates, resulting in heavy 
shooting for the rest of the night. Ini
tially, the guests participate as targets, 
but occasionally they are provoked 
into becoming partisan.
As George tells Nick, the husband, 
in the first act, It isnt the prettiest 
spectacle, seeing a couple of middle aged 
types hacking away at each other, all red
in the face, missing half the time. But 
as Nick points out, they rarely miss: 
theyre experts.
Running two hours and forty minutes, 
the play requires an extraordinary amount 
of energy from the actors. Especially
from Marilyn Eastman who plays Martha, 
a vivacious seductress and spiteful wife. 
Compared to Elizabeth Taylor in the same 
role in the film version, Ms. Eastmans 
performance is more shrewish and petty, 
than actually bitchy, and she loses some 
of the subtleties of Marthas essentially 
lazy sensuality and carelessly offensive 
bitchiness. However, her energy and 
emotion carries the show and makes it 
worth seeing.
Ms. Taylors seduction of Nick is 
more drunkedness than desire, but Ms. 
Eastman plays it as very deliberate; hips 
swinging and open-mouthed smiles make 
her desire for him so obvious that 
it would be embarrassing if they werent 
drunk and it werent between two and 
dawn. Often her horniness takes on a 
burlesque, amusing quality -amusing to 
both the audience and her husband.
As she gyrates her hips and juts out her 
breasts at Nick while they dance, George 
comments, smiling snugly, Its a familiar 
dance.^they both know it.THey like 
the way they move. He is entertained 
by her, not in the least jealous, and so 
I relaxed and enjoyed her antics without 
fearing another violent scene.
While Martha expends her force on little
attacks throughout the night, George 
merely defends himself or baits her 
gently, allowing himself to be beaten 
down, saving his energy for his viscious 
and final revenge. Larry Heller, as George, 
gives no hint of his prowess at their 
torturing game. Though this laid-back 
quality is written into the script, con
sidering that he lands the crippling blow 
of the play to his wife, the tone of his 
performance should have hinted at more 
violence in his nature. He didnt create 
enough tension to warn the audience 
that the seemingly cuckolded man is a 
very angry person and one who is as emotionally deformed as his wife.
Nick and Honey (Gerry Communale, 
Jr. ahd Nan Summer) are the dupes and 
weapons of Martha and George. Whoever 
has control of those two, has the power 
altogether. The constant shift of control 
is reflected nicely in the blocking: when 
George is in control, he sits on the couch, 
leaving his wife separate to stand or sit 
alone. When Martha has Honey and 
Nicks sympathy, she is sitting on the 
couch.
In addition to reflecting the balance 
of power, this couch built for three 
allowed Martha to face Nick, and oogle 
him without Honey seeing. When Martha 
goes to sit down on the couch, she slaps 
Honeys legs aside, and sits with her back 
to her. Honey, who does an interpretive 
dance around the living room at some 
point, with her arms swinging wildly,
is wonderfully out of it throughout the 
entire play and doesnt notice Marthas 
covetousness. She scoots over when 
Martha slaps her legs and beams uncomprehendingly as her husband and 
Martha dance, remarking with confusion 
that, Theyre dancing like theyve danced 
before.
After George delivers the final crippling 
blow to Martha by destroying the fantasy 
theyve tortured each other with, Honey 
and Nick leave, battered and speechless; 
defeated by the cruelty theyve just wit
nessed. A sense of defeat remains aftei 
them, despite the fact that thematically, it 
is a happy ending; Martha and George 
speak vaguely of starting a new kind of 
life.
The defeat remains because Martha, 
hunched low on a footstool listens to 
George singing, Whos afraid of Virginia 
Woolf, Virginia Woolf. . . -and says shes 
cold. Then she admits to being afraid of 
Virginia Woolf and though none of these 
details make any sense, they gestalt into 
a morbid feeling of despair and grief 
The contradictory end of the play suc
cessfully leaves the audience confused 
and mentally exhausted.
The show runs Thursdays, Fridays, and 
Saturdays at 8:30, Sundays at 7:30. 
Tickets cost $5.00 Thursdays and Fridays, 
$5.50 Saturdays, and $4.50 Sundays. 
Telephone the Plaza Theatre for reser
vations at 683-7770. The 54C bus from 
Oakland passes in front of the theatre.

YOU'VE ORDERED WINE 
IN A RESTAURANT, THE WAITER 
OPENS THE BOTTLE AND HANDS YOU THE CORK.
A. You keep the cork as a souvenir.
B. You smell the cork and tell the waiter 
whether or not (based on your evaluation 
of the cork) he should serve the wine.
You ignore the cork and sip the wine.
Blue Nun advises: When the 
waiter hands you the cork, 
take it. It should smell of 
wine. If it smells "corky" or 
"musty" this flavor may have 
been communicated to the 
wine. If the cork smells like 
wine, place it on the table 
and nod to the waiter to 
serve the wine.
Don't be

Trustees to discuss 
student affairs
There will be a meeting of the Trustees 
Committee on Student Affairs, Monday, 
April 17, at 10 AM in Room 206, Warner 
Hall.
The agenda is as follows:
1. The Club Sports-Varsity Sports Dilemma. (David Roussos, James Banner)
2. The motion to increase the Student Ac
tivities Fee. (Student Senate Represent 
tative)
3. Updates on Admission (Mr. Elliott) and 
Housing. (Mr. Swank, Mr. Dalton)
4. Such other items as may come to the at
tention of the Committee.
.. Students who wish to suggest additional 
items for possible inclusion on the agenda 
are invited to discuss them with Earle 
Swank, Dean of Student Affairs, second 
floor of Warner Hall.
Wage discriminates
Economist Milton Friedman called the 
minimum wage the most anti-Negro f 
law on the books. In a Stanford Uni
versity speech, he said the disgrace of 
high black teen-age unemployment stems 
from lousy schooling through govern
mental schools and the denial of onthe-job training because of higher min
imum wage laws. The Nobel Laureate 
economist said the U.S. has construct
ed a governmental welfare program which / 
has been a machine for producing poor 
people.

Kaplan breaks 
ground
by Stuart Seidman
On March 28 Robert Kaplan, Dean of 
the Graduate School of Industrial Admin
istration, led the ground breaking cer
emonies for the schools new addition.
The new addition will contain two 
lecture halls, meeting rooms, and offices 
which according to Kaplan will expand 
our flexibility in teaching courses. The 
addition was designed by the architecture 
firm of Johnstone, Newcomer, & Valentour, the architects of the original building. 
The cost of this new addition will be ap
proximately $800,000.
In his speech at the ground breaking 
ceremonies Kaplan explained the impor
tance of this new addition. He remarked 
that the addition is a very important. 
signal of GSIAs committment to its 
graduate programs, its masters and ex
ecutive programs, which have expanded in 
recent years and outgrown the facility 
which has more or less served us well for 
25 years.
He continued to explain that this 
building is an outgrowth of the Invest
ments in Progress campaign the univer
sity is currently conducting to raise money 
for the endowment, campus improvements, 
and financial aid. Kaplan explained that* 
the addition will be a tangible sign of the 
type of growth we would like to see on 
this campus.
A major dissappointment in the ad
dition will be the lack of external land
scaping. We had to eliminate all the 
landscaping, according to Kaplan, to save 
money.
Team reviews Architecture
by Stuart Seidman
The National Architectural Accredita
tion Board (NAAB) was on campus the 
week of March 19th to evaluate the Archtecture Department. Their final report 
will not be released until next September 
According to Robert Taylor, Acting 
Head of the Department, the visiting team 
found many strengths in our basic cur
riculum and its supporting components. 
They were particularly pleased with our 
progress with courses in the fields of 
design technology and management planning.
Taylor explained why the report will 
probably depict the Architecture Depart
ment favorably. The team was impressed 
with the depth and quality of our faculty 
and students. A.B. Geddis, the Chairman 
of the NAAB team, advised Taylor that the 
team recommendation will be positive.
A draft report from NAAB will be sent 
to CMU in early May for departmental 
review with the final report and accred
itation to be published in September.

Cancer research begins
continued from page 1
that chimps cant get this particular 
disease.
Chemical therapy, alone or in comb
ination with radiation or surgery, is one 
or our most effective cancer treatments 
today, Olson says. Federal regulations 
hamper the widespread use of new ther
apeutic chemicals by 5 to 10 years in some 
cases. __
The study will also evaluate consent 
forms and their use in patient treatment. 
Although the form is tailor-made to meet 
the individual needs of each patient, ac
cording to Olson, a recurring problem is 
that many cancer patients are in a highly 
emotional state when they sign the form. 
The feeling of give me anything to cure 
me is far too prevalent, he adds. (Evi
dence of this comes from from Dr.Kenneth 
Olson (no relation), former Chief of 
Diagnosis of the Cancer Biology and 
Diagnosis Division of NCI.  Often patients 
reach a point where they actually forget 
they ever signed the form due to emo
tional trauma. Dr. Olson came to CMIR 
to work on this project.) Richard Olson
adds, We will attempt to identify means 
to assist the patient in making a more ob
jective and rational decision about signing 
the consent form.
Also adding his expertise to the study is 
Dr. Arthur Denues who worked on a 
United States Commission to evaluate the 
bio-ethical considerations of research on 
prisoners stemming from the Nuremberg 
War Trials.
CMIR staff will solicit comments from 
doctors, nurses, families and clergy to 
determine the weak areas of communica
tion between the patient and the cancer 
specialist and how the patient perceives 
treatment, he says.
We must remember, Olson empha
sizes, that people with a diagnosis of 
cancer have two main motivations when 
they seek treatment. They hope to get 
well, and failing that, they hope someone 
else will benefit from the cancer research 
performed on them,We hope4n this study, 
to find means to safely accelerate the pace 
of cancer research to assure the prompt 
availability of our very best technology to 
those physicians waging the front line war 
on cancer.

President's 
Piece
by John Tumazos
The Administration has invited me to 
present my goals for the coming year to 
the Board of Trustees on April 17. Before 
the formal presentation, I think that I 
should present my goals to the student 
body. Anyone who wants to express his 
views can speak to me personally or leave 
a note in my Skibo mailbox. I!intend to 
use all available input to finalize my pre~ 
sentation.
Activities fee
Since 63% of the voters approved an in
crease from $25 to $30 per year, there is 
little doubt that the Trustees will ratify the 
increase.
My goal is to avoid a second increase in the 
Activities Fee next spring. That is why 
we have lobbied for University funding of
office. Dorm residents should not be rea^ 
signed against their will when they have 
not abused any privileges (paragraph 7). 
Charges should not be levied when a room
mate moves out (paragraph 8). Students 
fundamental Constitutional rights should 
be respected. Strict policies in force during 
the September housing crunch need not be 
in force all year long.
Academic Attrition
A lot of students flunk out of CMU. I suspect that several departments admit 
many more students than they plan to 
graduate.
Academic attrition, which helps to create 
serious academic pressures, has enormous 
human costs. We cause an occasional suicide/ perhaps a few nervous breakdowns, 
drive even more students to the counsel
ling center, and send many students home 
with broken dreams each year. Any need
less human suffering that exists is uncon
scionable.
In addition, the academic pressures at 
CMU seriously affect the social environ
ment.

AMS underclassmen are transferring to 
other schools. The students constantly 
must watch for the right time and place to 
provide input into the Universitys 
decision-making process.
Unity
While this may be my most important 
goal, it is not something that the Trustees 
can give us.
When the various segments of our cam
pus reach a consensus, we have a better 
chance of influencing the Administration.
I would like to see joint resolutions of the 
Faculty and Student Senates. I*d like to 
see more interaction between the Student 
Senate and SDC. Most importantly, Id 
like to see good relations between Greeks 
and Independents. (I will write about the 
Watermelon Bash controversy next week). 
Reform of Student Senate
Once again, this is something that the 
Trustees cant do for us.
Most of the power in student govern
ment resides in offices that are not filled 
in campus wide elections. In fact, only 
the president is elected by the entire stu
dent body. The Senate elects its own of
ficers and the president appoints many 
more offices. Not only does this deny the 
electorate direct participation in the 
selection of officers, but it encourages 
behind the scenes deals. The student 
body might have more confidence and less 
apathy if they are granted more participa
tion in the selection of their representa
tives.
Many problems plague the Student 
Senates budgetary process. I urge you to 
step forward and attend Budget Reform 
Committee meetings so you may provide 
input into the proposed changes.
Many issues are important. However, if 
I can bring three for four points to the 
Trustees attention, weve done a lot. PTease
let me know how you feel on the issues.

President Cyert reports to parents
The following address was reprinted 
from the March issue of PARENTS 
BULLETIN, a publication of CMU.
Recently, on separate occasions, I have 
been addressing the concept of excellence 
within the activities of the University. In 
a recent meeting with the faculty I spoke 
at some length about the necessary care 
and attention which we must pay to under
graduate education if we are to continue 
to improve on the already excellent record 
of the institution.
A great university is one in which the 
faculty members give education the same 
attention and care they give research. Un
dergraduate teaching receives the same at
tention from senior faculty as graduate 
teaching. I realize that these propositions 
may run counter to the desires of many 
faculty and to the beliefs of others about 
the reward system.
The answer to the former is simple. 
Universities are rapidly moving into the age 
of the undergraduate and the terminal 
masters student. On a purely financial 
basis it is clear that any university must 
attract undergraduates to survive and that 
the decline in high school graduates avail
able for higher education is going to make 
each school more competitive in its recruit
ment policies. Good teaching and strong 
research make for an outstanding academic 
reputation. It is an outstanding academic 
reputation that students indicate is the at
tractive force for them. In a recent survey 
of our entering freshmen, one in which 
some 745 participated, 86% indicated that 
they chose CMU because of its academic 
reputation.
Many young faculty members get the 
idea that teaching is unimportant in the 
reward structure here and at other firstclass research universities. We have tried in 
a number of ways to make sure that atten
tion is paid to teaching by the committees 
on promotion and tenure. The faculty, 
through the Faculty Senate, has specified 
a number of approaches that departments 
must take to get the views of students on a 
particular candidate. Even without the 
specific reward factor, however, it is in
cumbent on each of us to strive for excell
ence in teaching. In general, our teaching is 
good and is well-received by the students. 
There are occasional complaints, but we 
have only a couple of departments at the 
undergraduate level that are viewed as 
weak by the students and at least one of 
these departments is in the process of cor
rection. Our greatest problem is with graduate students that teach a course or section 
without any training or supervision. This 
condition seems to occur more frequently 
in the undergraduate courses for which 
GSIA has responsibility. The dean, the 
provost, and I are in agreement on the exis
tence of the problem and Dean Kaplan is 
taking action to correct it.
We have improved our technology of 
teaching and brought ourselves up to date 
with new methods through the internal 
Carnegie Foundation grants. We must, 
however, find ways to continue to retain 
the high quality of teaching and hopefully 
to improve further our level. One way that 
is under investigation is the establishment 
of a center or institute for the study of 
education as a discipline. This idea has 
been proposed by a faculty member from 
the University of California at Berkeley 
and is an idea with some merit. I will be 
discussing this idea with'a selected group of 
people in more detail. The main point is 
that we must continue to look hard at our 
teaching methods and for ways of improving 
the way we teach. I do not mean that we 
must always be looking for the latest fad 
and pushing it. We are not seeking innovaV
\
\
tion for the sake of innovation. For some 
courses and some people, certain methods 
are undoubtedly better than others. Never
theless, it is clear that higher education has 
been backward in its analysis of its own 
educational methods.
Along with the effort in improving 
teaching we must continue to look at our 
curricula in departments and colleges. 
Each department must remain on top of 
developments in its field and seek to incor
porate in its curriculum those developments 
that are relevant. In addition, we must be 
sensitive to the opportunities that become 
available to our students in the world. 
Demographic changes are bringing with 
them many opportunities for change in ed
ucation. There are also changes in the in
terests of students which have relevance for 
us. We have to find a balance between 
changing with every fad and being sensitive 
to changes in the world.
In an entirely different context I am aware that many of you have shared my 
pleasure in the outstanding record of our 
athletic program.
I am pleased with the way in which our 
athletic program has developed. As I have 
told many of you, we looked hard at the 
whole question of whether or not we 
should continue in intercollegiate athletics.
I formed a committee consisting of fsjculty. 
students, and administration to investigate 
the subject. The unanimous recommenda
tion of the committee was that we should 
continue. This preference was also mine, 
but I felt we should have a winning program 
if we were to continue.
When Ray Haynes reached the age when 
it is customary for a department head to 
resign his administrative duties, we were 
left without an athletic director. 1 asked 
the committee and we looked at many 
candidates all across the country. It was 
clear that Jim Banner was the outstanding 
candidate, and 1 was pleased when we were 
able to hire him. He in turn has put together 
an outstanding group of coaches and in a 
short period of time the program has be
come an excellent one.
We have managed to turn our program 
around while retaining our amateur" 
status. We are playing collegiate athletics 
as they should be played. Athletes and 
nonathletes are treated exactly the same 
way with respect to financial aid and aca
demic requirements. The University pro
vides intercollegiate competition as part of 
an academic program concerned with the 
total development of an individual. There 
is no attempt on our part to buy " athletes, 
and there never will be so long as I am pres
ident. I believe one of the most corrupt as
pects of universities in the United States is 
the program of schools i e so-called bigtime" athletics. The concept of the athletic 
scholarship is contrary to the nature of a
university.
I am delighted that our coaches recruit 
athletes on the strength of our academic 
programs. The student-athlete comes here 
because of the academic advantages Camegie-Mellon offers. As long as we maintain 
our athletic program on this basis, it will 
be solid.
Among the many aspects of Jim Banners 
administration that I approve of and admire is his desire for a balanced program. 
We do not look upon our sports program as 
consisting of major and minor sports. All 
of our activities are major, and we are 
interested in a well-rounded program. This 
balance, in my view, is the only way to 
maintain a successful program.
Many of you will be aware of the news
papers speculation that Mr. Banner might 
leave Carnegie-Mellon University to become 
Athletic Director of Bradley University in 
Illinois. I am pleased to be able to report 
that, although a very good offer was made 
to Mr. Banner, he rejected it because of his 
loyalties to Carnegie-Mellon University and 
his sense of commitment to the accomplish
ment which he has begun here. I am 
pleased that our athletic program will 
continue to go forward under such strong 
leadership.
I want to thank all of you for your 
support, both financial and moral. With a 
little luck we will have more than our share 
of athletic success.
I have dealt at some length with ongoing 
efforts to insure excellence in the under
graduate experience both in the areas of 
teaching and in the area of the athletic pro
gram. When a University has been recog
nized for its excellence it is all too easy to 
set as one's next objective the consolida
tion of gains and reinforcements of those 
activities which have already been success
ful. From my point of view the price of 
excellence is a constant renewal both of 
planning and implementation. For those 
reasons I will be involving the entire leader
ship of the campus, administrative and aca
demic as well as faculty in a two-day con
ference to take place immediately after 
graduation in May where without interrup
tion from the daily schedule and the oper
ational detail of the University we will 
focus on the planning of an even greater 
excellence for this University in the 
future. It is my hope that this meeting will 
stimulate the development of strategies that 
can carry us to new levels dunng the re
maining time of my Presidency. CarnegieMellon is a great institution and when I 
step down I want it to be still greater. My 
energies and efforts are dedicated to that 
task. I know that you all are committed in 
sharing with me in this endeavor.

Cyert discusses Music facilities
bv Scott Sibley
In response to a complaint delivered to 
the Grievance Committee by Senator Carl 
Freedman(CFA), three students met recentl> with President Cyert to discuss the 
Music Department's facilities.
President Cyert stated that there are no 
immediate plans for any large facility 
changes. He also staled iTiai there are no 
dnect savings from cancellation of the 
Music Education program because the Mu
sic Ed faculty will be maintained foi three 
years to allow current students to complete 
the program. He added that additional 
money is being allocated to the Music 
Department for the development of their 
new program jnd for repairs on existing 
facilities.
As lar as practice rooms are concerned.
Cyert said, at many times during the day, 
these rooms are empty and available." 
It was pointed out that students* have 
classes during these times and that from 
6 PM until midnight, every night, there 
is a wait for both music and drama prac
tice rooms.
This is the first time the space problem 
has been brought to my attention..' Cyert 
stated.'
Cyert also remarked that the Music 
Department will probably take fewer 
students until the reputation of the new 
program develops. This would help alle 
viate the space shortage problem.
Cyert completed his remarks by siatine 
that the University can and will get mone> 
to take care ot these problems when it .i 
determined exactly what the problems are

Compubookie is back again
Note:-The Compubookie is a little green 
gnome who lives under Panther Hollow 
Bridge and who coifies out once a year to 
make comments and predictions on the 
buggy races.
The pragmatic prognosticator returns to 
cap on all you buggy buffs. Last years 
wonderful record could remain intact this 
year, due to the angry weather go'ds. Prac
tice time has been almost nonexistent, so 
the big trophy is up for grabs. Here are this 
years predictions.
PI KAPPA ALPHA
Only the most feeble minded frenchmen 
would think that Pika can Ward off fhe 
challenges of Beta and CIA. But listening 
to Bosch talk Brado one thinks Pika Curran 
do it. Baby buns laceyed with sunshine will 
solidify their chances. Can they replace 
four A team pushers from last years 
2:17.8 team? Difficult to say, impossible
to do ....... Theyve done stranger things
before. Remember when Edie bakes, Pika 
rolls.
PHI KAPPA THETA
The Streak (or its shadow) does roll 
well. With this years improved push team, 
Phi Kap has a Hague of a chance (seven 
years of Hague), if Big John doesnt get 
caught sneaking out of their tent. At least 
they will finish in the top half for design 
and make money on their booth.
CIA
Hantz anyone got a team like theirs? I 
only hope that the pushers dont get too 
many demerits because without pushers 
even a little Black Magic and lots of Desire 
couldnt help. Seriously Frank and Lou, 
youve done good\ I honestly believe (and 
so does Beta) that CIA is about a year 
away from winning.
SAE
No longer controlled by Thomas 
bakery ovens, the SAEs have emerged even 
without their King (Kong). Heat 10 is their 
chance. Look out ATO and Sigma Nu. You 
might be battling for second in your heat
"Remember when Edie 
bakes, Pika rolls"
and possibly your charter.
ATO
The ATOs have finally decided that 
heavier objects dont roll faster. Now all 
they have to do is to keep their rubber on 
in the presence of female drivers. Keeping 
their gates anchored will help too-their 
new garbage bag buggy certainly wont. 
The Tri-Delts-oops, 1 mean the ATOs 
will probably finish the race in a wonder
ful, but no winning time.
SIGMA NU
Driver appears erratic and the push team 
is a question mark. Jones will be missed*
They will roll well, but ....... well, I just
don't think this is their year*
BETA
Came to a buggy meeting and said 
someone stole our wheels." They sure 
havent shown that in freerolls 2:27.5 bn 
square wheels.
Best push team on campus combined 
with an excellent roll make them the team 
to beat. Yet something always seems 
to go wrong for them. Listen for their 
ECHO, the alumni are praying that it 
isn't another of Randys tantrums.
DELTS
Most consistent rolling buggy over the 
years. Looks equally good A sub 2:30 
from them is expected*
FRINGE
Always competitive but don't practice 
enough to be great. Look for the B teams 
in the following order:
Beta, Pika, ATO, CIA, Phi Kappa Theta
......Kappa Sig A*
PREDICTIONS
1. Pikago with tradition (Rock n' Roll 
is here to stay.)
2. Betaalways a favorite (Go Yellow
Pig!!!)
3. CIAMagic in their eyes (sawdust in 
their brains.)
4. ATO(DDD)if perfect could surprise 
(bedcheckSunday noon.)
"Someone stole our 
wheels. Listen for 
their echo."
5. Phi Kappa ThetaNo. I5 in design 
(smell them buggies)
6. Sigma Nucould wind up last in heat 
10 (and first in the hospital.)
7. SAEjust ready to compete with 
traditional powers (Dean Swank, Cyert, 
ATO, etc., etc.)

IM basketball reaches climax
by Ed Sullivan
The intamural basketball season wound 
its way to a dramatic conclusion on IM 
night as the Celtics took the major division, 
the C-Map Show Stoppers won the inter
mediate and, the night before, Nads-B 
captured the minor title. None of the point 
spreads were above seven points and all 
three games were hotly contested.
The Celtics downed Reality II by six, 
62-56, with help from Larry DiCicco (19 
points), Mike Gurskey (18 points) and Roy 
Parker (13 pts.). The roster is rounded out 
by Leroy Harris (5 pts.), Jerold B. Ash (4 
pts.), Ken Gerszenyi (3 pts.) and Bill 
Kapner. Coaches are Bob Firm and Dan
Bergman.
The Celtics were up by ten at halftime, 
31-21, by virtue of 16 first half points by 
DiCicco, K.Spann was keeping Reality II 
in the game with 10 of his team leading 21 
points. In the second half, Parker and Gur
skey poured in with and ten points respect
ively, while Winston Thomas (9pts.) and 
R. Nelson (10 pts.) of Reality II exploded 
for most of their points. T. Austin (10 pts) 
and E. Spencer ( 6 pts.), T.Mackin, 
and R.Henderson rounded out the roster 
with Thomas also doing the coaching.
In the Intermediate final, the Cretins 
got 22 points from Dan Horgan, but this 
could not defeat the balanced attack of the
Summer softball at CMU?
UNDERGRADUATES, GRADUATE 
STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND STAFF: 
Interested in playing softball at C-MU 
this summer? If you are, dont get your 
hopes up too high. The Athletic Depart
ment is planning to have the IM field re
paired this summer. .. again. Specifically, 
this means:
IM softball is limited to a season of ap
proximately three weeks (i.e.5 April 
3-23), including playoffs, for 73 part
icipating teams;
The possibility of organizing a softball 
league for approximately 200 persons 
studying and working at C-MU during 
the months of June and July is very 
doubtful.
The attempt made to level and seed
the IM field last summer was marginally 
successful. Except for the levelling of badly 
cratered areas of the field, a distinct 
lack of foliage (i.e., neither grass nor 
weeds) was noticed over most of the field 
prior to December 1977. This was pri
marily a result of the intense varsity 
practice and IM competitions in both football and soccer during the Fall semester. 
Not only was summer 77 softball pre
empted, but no visible attempt was made 
by the Athletic Department to obtain 
fields so a league could be organized at 
C-MU* Similarly, although unplanned, the 
1977 IM softball season was prematurely 
shortened in April to expedite performing 
the renovations, which did not begin until 
continued on page 39
C-Map Show Stoppers which saw every 
member of the team in the score column. 
The Cretins even led 18-17 at half-time, 
but they were hurt by very skimpy field 
goal production in the second half as 
C-Map ran to a 45-38 triumph.
Jeff Fair led the C-Map attack with ten 
pts., and M.Brown had eight and Tony 
Watson pulled in with seven. Ben Meachem ( 6 pts), Tony Benson (4), J.Isaac 
Ed Cooper, N.Dawson aid J.Harris (all 
with 2 pts.) all had a hand in the victory. 
C-Map was coached by Benson and Spann.
The Cretins countered with Horgans 
22 points, 6 by G. Calabria and five by J. 
Cooper. N.Goldberg (3 pts), Ed Florento 
(2 pts.), D. Parker, E.Marcink and B. Gould 
filled out the Squad with Joanne Simonetti 
and Heidi Todd as coaches.
Not to be outdone by the big boys, 
the minor division Nads-B and Mech E. 
Grads played to a dramatic two point vic
tory for Nads-B. The 31-29 finish was the 
closest of the final scores. The game was up 
for grabs ^throughout as the half-time score 
was 13-11 with the Grads on top.
The victorious Nads were paced by 
Kownacki with 12 points and Hart with 9. 
Zwinn pulled in 6 and Troutuetter had 4. 
The lineup also contains McCall, Piccoli, 
Oberkircher, Manning and Stavesinci. The 
Grads also had a 12 point scorer, Cendros. 
Tapler (7 pts), Morris and Mullan (4 pts. 
each) and Batarags (2 pts.) rounded out the 
Grads scoring. Also on the squad were 
Vigil, Dittmar, Lloyd and Ling.

A stumble after a fine start
by Bjorn Berger
The CMU mens tennis teams winning 
streak was halted by Westminster College 
Saturday. Westminster, which is known for 
its superb athletic program, defeated CMU' 
7-2.
Gary Kemeny, in the first singles po
sition, played well in the first two sets, 
but lost his concentration and eventually 
fell to Westminsters Dave Jones 7-6, 
3-6, 6-0. Kemeny pointed to an ailing 
suntan condition as one cause for his de
feat. John Sze lost an unusually one
sided match 61, 63, 62, in the number 
2 singles position. Number four Marc Silver 
fell in three sets 6-3, 3 6, 6-2, and num
ber five Mike Straub lost his match 6-1, 
6-4. CMUs only bright spots were Greg 
Maskarinecs victory at the number three 
position 6-0, 6-3, and Dave Kirby's 
come-from-behind effort 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 
at number six.
Westminsters doubles line-up made 
quick work of CMU, sweeping all three 
matches without the loss of a set. The 
CMU players noted that high winds and 
chilly temperatures upset them more than 
their opponents, and one Westminster 
player said that they were, in fact, used to 
such conditions.
Though Westminster is not a confer
ence school, these matches will count on 
the team members individual records.

In their first conference match of the 
spring season, the CMU men's tennis team 
scored a resounding victory over Washing
ton and Jefferson College in Washington, 
Pa. Wednesday afternoon. The team was at 
its freshest in recent memory as a result of 
indoor practice this winter and a training 
trip to Tennessee during Spring Break.
In number one position, senior Gary 
Kemeny easily trounced W&Js Jim Fernberger 6-2, 64, employing well-placed 
groundstrokes and his usual tactical strate
gies. Sophomore John Sze, suffering from 
elbow trouble and the powerful serve of 
W&J's Tom Sniscak, fell in three sets 4-6, 
64, 6-2 in the second singles position. Greg 
Maskarinec, CMUs only starting freshman, 
humbled W&Js Bob Bear 6-1. 6-4. and 
junior Marc Silver smothered his W&J foe 
6*2, 6-2. The numbers five and six singles 
had a rougher time hitting their stride, 
however. Mike Straub battled back to win 
in three sets 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, and sophomore 
Dave Kirby also had to come from behind 
to win a nail-biter 4-6, 6-3, 7-5
The doubles line-up, which has tradi
tionally been the Achilles heel of the tennis 
team, enjoyed unusually easy going against 
W&J. Kemeny and Sze triumphed in the 
first doubles slot 7-6, 6-2, as did Straub 
and Silver 6-2, 6-3. Left-handed Ralph 
Peters puzzled his doubles opponents with 
his dazzling spin serve, and he and Maskarino won easily 6-0, 6-4.
Coach Peggy Russell managed to con
tain her ebulence long enough to comment, 
Well, we seem to be playing much better.
I have great hopes for this team this season.
I think we could be a terrifying force in the 
conference this spring. The tennis squads 
first me match will be on Saturday, 
Apri against Duquesne, but they can be 
seei licing their racquet wizardry any 
aft on on the CMU courts.
Russell would also like to inform

Buggy predictions given
by Michael Gibbs
Sweepstakes, 1978 _besins at 9AM 
this Friday morning. Thousands of stu
dents, alumni, and other interested parties 
plan to be on hand for the annual carnival 
attraction. This years race promises to be 
one of the most exciting in recent years. 
Murmurs of a new course record have not 
gone unnoticed, (however die importance 
of good weather for the accomplishment of 
this feat has also been noted).
A total of 31 entries are scheduled for 
the 11 preliminary heats. The following 
line-up will give you a good idea of what to 
watch for.
ZBT will be running in heats one and 
two. In an unprecedented maneuver last 
year the ZBTs tried to mate their buggy 
with an unknown canine. Although this 
may represent a substantial advancement 
in buggy building technology, the time just 
wasnt quite right and the innovative pro
ject was scratched.
In heat four we see KS A and CIA "A. 
For Kappa Sig their hopes ride on a scant 
$34.95, (the name of their new buggy). 
CIA promises to be one of the top conten
ders this year. The combination of magic 
and desire may prove to be all that is re
quired to bring home top honors.
PKT in heat six will try to show that 
their buggy effort is more than just a sha
dow of their past glory. The top three 
places having escaped their grasp for the 
past several years, PKT needs a strong 
comeback to stop their losing streak.
In heat seven Fringe A is going to try to 
regain such laurels as sixth place two years 
ago. Fallen to the fate of many all-nighters, 
the majestic Buttress may require massive 
architectural innovation if it is ever to fly 
again.
Heat eight pits DTD A, SDC A and
PIKA B against each other. The DHt\ have consistently had a well rolling buggy.
1 lity will be joined by whose application 
ot Delt technology may leave us all in a 
bit ol a haze. In addition PIKA B will be 
trying to break into the top six, a spot that 
has eluded their B - Team in the past sev
eral years.
Bl I A A should command heat nine. 
Last year's innovative approach to the star
ting line showed among other things a lack 
ol manual dexterity. Assuming the BITA's 
make it to the starting line, their jubilation 
should echo for miles around. DU A, also 
in heat nine, may return to Phoenix tech
nology it the Duke doesn't survive his re
cent surgery.
Heat ten should not be missed as it will 
be one of the most exciting heats of the 
day. SAE A will undoubtedly show plenty 
of hustle while ATO A hopes to fly like an 
eagle. Last year ATO just edged out SAE 
for fourth place and this years rematch is 
shaping up well. SN A, also in heat ten, will 
send its as yet untried Scorpion to do the 
job of Hornet. Hornet got tangled in a spi
ders web last year and Scorpion will have 
to prove its sting to be mighty powerful in 
order to avoid a similar fate.
PIKA A will own heat eleven. Three 
year champs and current record holders, 
the PIKAs return with their fast rolling 
buggies. PILAM A, also in heat eleven, has 
before it the task of sysyphus. The PILAMs 
have to make up for many lost years.
Such is the line-up for this years races. 
Fourteen organizations in all will be com
peting foi the coveted first-place trophy. 
But who will get it?
Sigma Nu has to duplicate the roll of 
the Hornet in order to stay close. ATO and 
SAE should be battling rather closely for 
places in the top six. If ATO can improve 
their rubber technology we may see one of 
their best times in recent years. CIA is re
turning with one of the fastest buggies on 
campus, Black Magic, and an extremely 
strong pushteam. Last years third place 
finish has sparked a lot of activity in the 
CIA clubhouse'and look for them to be in 
the top three places again this year.
BETA and PIKA should battle it out for 
the remaining two of the top three places. 
BETA brings with it a fast rolling buggy 
and a very experienced pushteam. PIKA re
turns with the know-how of how to win 
three years in a row, but has a relatively in
experienced group of pushers. There may 
be only one direction for PIKA to go this 
year.
The times will be fast. If the weather is 
warm and calm, the top three times could 
all be under 2:20. This is extremely fast 
when you consider the fact that in buggy 
history the 2:20 barrier has been broken 
only three times.

GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!

Summer softball at CMU?
continued from page 37
after May graduation*
Why is this so important? For my own 
selfish reasons, 1 enjoy playing competi
tive softball. Last summer was the first 
summer in 12 years that I didnt play or
ganized softball, and I dont want this year 
to be the second. 1 'also suspect that there 
are many other people at CMU who, for
IM b-ball 
finished
The 73 teams signed up for IM Softball 
this season is an all-time school record for 
participation. The commissioners are Glenn 
Giacobbe and Ed Zaunick.
It is not too late to sign for fencing 
and archery. If you are interested, see Miss 
Fisk before April 20.
The IM track meet will be held on Fri
day, April 21. The list of events include 
880 relay, mile run, 100 yard dash, 880 
yard run, 1 mile relay, shot put, high 
jump, and long jump.
The table tennis singles champion is

A course in Closed Chest Cardiopul
monary Resuscitation will be offered by 
Earl Birdy and Mark Keppler from Mon
day, April 24 through Thursday April 27 
at 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM in the Pool in 
the Gym building. There is no charge for 
the course and further information can be 
had from Mr. Birdy at ext. 2214.
A commissioner is needed for IM Rifle.
the competition or just the plain enjoy
ment of it, feel the same way I do. Neither 
the IM program nor CMUs summer popu
lation are getting a fair deal again this 
summer.
Now is the time to make your feelings 
known to the people who are planning this 
venture. Whether you are a disgruntled 
graduate student, faculty member, or an 
undergraduate who would like to play 
more softball this spring, make your opin
ions known! Let Mr. Banner know how 
you feel. Send a letter to the Athletics 
Department, call on the phone (578-221 2), 
or stop by and tell him in person. A letter 
sent to Dr. Cyert may also be effective, and 
gets right to the top. Im sure that both Mr. 
Banner and Dr0 Cyert, along with myself, 
are anxious to hear your opinion,
