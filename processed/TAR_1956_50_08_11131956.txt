MB Has 
For Theatre
Playhouse
Party
The Broadway and Hollywood hit The Desperate Hours has 
been chosen as the play for the Mortar Board all-school theater party 
on Thursday, December 6.
In order to raise money for the Mortar Board scholarships awardto two outstanding juniors each# 
spring the senior womens honor
ary has arranged the party for the 
entire Tech community. The 
Cqj^Lt Avenue Theater of the 
Playhouse has been reserved for 
the occasion, and passes to the 
restaurant and bar will be given 
with every ticket.
The Desperate Hours tells the 
harrowing story of an average 
family whose home is invaded by 
three homicidal escaped convicts.
It displays the attractive humanity 
of its sympathetic characters and 
the believable quality of their 
sir%)le heroism.
As an added attraction the Mor
tar Boards are planning a light 
intermission entertainment, the 
theme of which is to be announced 
later.
Tickets, obtainable from any 
member of Mortar Board, are $1.75 
apiece. They are being distributed 
to fraternities, sororities, and 
dormitories this week, and will be 
on sale in Skibo at a later date.
Faulty members may obtain their 
tickets from Dr. Norman awes,
Room FA 105, extension 426. For 
further information contact Han
nah Oppenheimer, Morewood 
Gardens 4C5, MU 2-8890.
KKGs Sponsoring 
All Sorority Party
The friendly inter - sorority 
sjKMt will be exhibited again to
morrow night at a Meet the 
Greeks party in the basement of 
the Beta Theta Pi house.
Sponsored this year by Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, the party was 
originated by the Thetas two years 
ago, when they held an all-soror
ity tea before the Panhellenic 
formal dance. The Thetas spon
sored it again last year, and sug
gested to the other six sororities 
tB&t it be held by different soror
ity each year on a rotation sys
tem.
This years party will be an in
formal ginger-beer, and pretzel 
affair following the shoe shine 
campaign for the U.N. trip. All 
sorority actives and pledges are 
invited, including any wandering 
greeks, who have transferred 
from other colleges.
Grad Faculties 
To Give Talks 
On Behavior
The graduate faculties of psy
chology and industrial administra
tion have announced a series of 
public lectures on Recent Develop
ments in the Behavioral Sciences. 
The first lecture will be given at 
3:30 p.m. Thursday, November 29 
in the auditorium of the graduate 
school of industrial administration.
The series, which is the first of 
its kind at Carnegie Tech, will 
survey some of the more promising 
areas in which studies of human 
behavior are currently in progress 
at Carnegie Tech and elsewhere. 
Lectures will be given by four 
members of the Carnegie Tech fac
ulty and will be open to all inter
ested students.
Physiological Correlates 
The talks will cover (in non
technical terms) new methods of 
research now being developed as 
well as some representative recent 
findings. They will deal with such 
subjects as how humans think, 
the physiological correlates of hu
man behavior, the operation of 
experimental organizations, and 
factors affecting individual behav
ior in a social situation.
Students interested in increasing 
their knowledge of either the areas 
of study under investigation or the 
methods used in current behavior 
research are invited to attend the 
lectures. The complete schedule 
of talks is as follows:
Thursday, November 29: Inte
grating Man and Society  Pro

Atlantic that deserve quite as much intelligent discussion as we

Roughly one week ago, students 
in West Berlin were reported de
monstrating in quick succession 
first against the Franco-British 
move on Suez and then, more
vehemently, at the Brandenburg | CoUlicil CoitMiitteP

Student Congress 
Refers W and J 
Matter To CFP
The Rules Committee reported 
last Wednesday at the Student 
Council meeting that they had 
completed their investigation on 
the squabble between Tech and 
Washington and Jefferson Univer
sity. It was determined that all 
damage done by our students was 
done by members of fraternities 
and thus the matter would be re
ferred to the Council of Fraternity 
Presidents.
The Campus Chest reported that 
at that time, they had received 
$1700 and had been pledged an 
additional $150.
The council then voted to make 
a member of Alpha Phi Omega 
the chairman of the election com
mittee. There was a move to com
bine the old Student Contingency 
Fund with the Council Fund.
It was voted upon and approv
ed to make the Rules Committee 
custodian of all records, minutes, 
bills and reports of all the com
mittees of Student Congress.
Each of these committees is to 
make a progress report at the 
next Student Council meeting, on 
December 5.

some interesting students.
of us would not agree with the 
West Berliners in labeling them 
as like cases.
The difficulty is in judging the 
Suez move. Ten days ago an.edi
torial in a Pittsburgh paper re: 
ferred to it unhesitatingly as 
naked imperialist aggression, ! 
but this judgment employs the 
ambivalent word imperialism, j 
which was born in controversy | 
and sprang first into use only 
right after our own war with ; 
Spain in 1898.
Imperialism: Two Aspects
As someone born in the Middle 
East, I myself will testify that 
what Kipling insisted was the 
heart of British imperialism  
a steady devotion to world order 
 still has importance as one of 
the many motives in the swirl of 
politics about the Suez Canal. It

Co - Directors Of SnS
Since this is the second year Scotch n Soda has been done in the 
round, weve overcome most of the basic technical problems, so that, 
this year we can take a more creative approach to directing. We ^>ope 
that this will result in a richer and more unique show.
Of World Unrest
This week foreign students far 
removed from the fate of their 
homes and people have been ap
prehensive and restless. In the last 
three weeks reality was finally 
torn out of its abstract conversa
tional disguise and shown to the 
people in all its Machiavellian 
splendor. Once again the carpet 
was pulled out from under the 
vacillists and the neutralists; once 
more some people were forced 
to choose or perish.
There is no reason why this state 
of affairs should not continue for 
some time yet, or repeat itself in 
the future. The International Club 
has been searching for some per
sonage who would be capable of 
presenting some facts about 
American foreign policy in Hun
gary; facts that could serve as 
bases of prediction of what will 
happen next time a country ex
plodes.
We believe it might be possible 
to entertain a panel of Hungarians 
at the next meeting, to direct 
questioning along specific lines. 
Foreign students on campus would 
be most grateful for intelligent 
endeavor in this direction. Sug
gestions concerning the main 
speaker for this meeting may be 
directed to Peer Soelberg, Box 
362, or any officer of the club.
This week the International 
Club meets on Sunday, November 
18. at 8:00 p.m. in Carnegie Union. 
Graduate student Noach Amitay 
from Israel will attempt to inter
pret what happened last week in 
Israel. Mr. Amitay graduated from 
Haifa Institute of Technology and 
is presently a candidate for a 
Ph.D. in electrical engineering. 
Like most Israeli students, he has 
acquired a profound practical ex
perience concerning the history of 
his country, an experience we 
are most grateful to utilize.
Refreshments will be served. 
New members, off-Tech students, 
and interested Americans are most 
welcome, as always.

Evelyn Alessio: An All Around 
Teehite In Every Possible Way
Editors note: This is the second in a series on outstanding student 
personalities.
Extra-curricular activities are very time-consuming, but many 
students find the time to put away their books for a few hours and
enter into these activities. Among< 
these students is hard-working, 
vivacious Evelyn Alessio.
Evie came to Carnegie Tech as 
a sophomore transfer student from 
Seton Hill College, and has man
aged, in the two and some years 
that she has been here to become 
one of Techs most outstanding 
women.
One of the largest demands on 
Evies time is her role of Mortar 
Board president. Speaking in this 
capacity, she says that the pro
gram for Mortar Board this year is 
All Tech Service. The idea is to 
cross all school boundaries, extra
curricular activities, social and 
scholarship, so that wherever there 
is a need Mortar Board will en
deavor to satisfy it, either within 
its own organization or with the 
co-operation of existing groups on 
campus. Mortar Board, in an at
tempt to carry out this program, 
is currently engaged in sending 
its members to speak to high 
school students on College life.
Chest Chairman
As chairman of the Campus 
Chest campaign, Evie has just 
completed a highly successful 
drive to obtain funds for the var
ious charities to which the Tech 
community donates. Last year she 
was publicity director for the cam
paign.
At the end of her junior year 
Evie was called to Phi Kappa Phi, 
the scholastic honorary, and cur
rently ranks in the upper two per 
cent of the school. She is a mem
ber of the Deans Undergraduate 
Advisory Committee, the judici
ary branch of the Student Council, 
and has belonged to all the wom
ens class activities honoraries. As
Integration Theme 
Of Citcom Plans 
For Coming Year
With an actual membership of 
140 and the largest potential mem
bership of any group on campus, 
Citcom Clan has proven itself to 
be one of the most successful 
methods of integrating commuters 
into Carnegie social life.
Citcom (short for Carnegie In
stitute of Technology Commuters) 
extends membership privileges to 
every student who does not reside 
on campus or belong to a social 
fraternity or sorority. Its primary 
aims are to provide campus social 
life and foster school spirit both 
of which are often lacking in the 
non-fraternity commuter.
To accomplish its first aim, Cit
com holds at least four social 
events each month, including 
swims, mixers, dances, hayrides, 
and skating and bowling parties.
An Integral Part
Participation in most of the intiamural sports is first on the list 
of Citcoms means of making the 
commuter an integral part of Car
negie life, rather than a part-time 
Tartan, unwilling either to give 
service to the school or take part 
in its social functions.
Stressing participation as the 
key to integration, Citcom also 
builds a Homecoming display, 
races a buggy, and manages a 
booth at Spring Carnival, and se
lects a Military Ball Queen Candi
date.
Each member is assigned to one 
of the Clans five committees, So
cial, Publicity, Athletic, Member
ship, or General Activities, so that 
at some time or another, he is ac
tively engaged in some phase of 
Clan planning or programming.
Recently elected officers of Cit
com are: George Roth, president; 
Chuck Poirier, vicepresident, 
Paula Fierst, secretary, and Rort 
Lanyl, treasurer.

national journalism honorary, she 
worked as editor of the Student 
Handbook, and is currently social 
chairman to the honorary. She is 
also a member of the Mademoiselle 
College Board.
Active Social Life
Evies social life is not disrupted 
by her heavy scholastic and activ
ities schedule As a member of 
the Delta Gamma sorority she 
finds time to participate in most of 
that groups activities. Frequently 
she spends Sunday afternoons at 
the Symphony escorted by an at
tractive young gentleman, and she 
has been known to make week
end trips to a well-known Eastern 
university.
An English major, Evie hopes to 
go into some phase of educational 
public relations. Her interest in 
this field first began when she 
started doing summer work at 
Alcoa. Four of her summers have 
been spent working with this 
company. However, this past sum

of being secretary to the coordin

LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1
In this day of swift international communications, 
like radio, television, and the raft, it becomes increasingly 
important for all of us to have a solid grounding in 
foreign languages. Accordingly, I have asked the makers 
of Philip Morris whether I might not occasionally forego 
levity in this column and instead use it for a short lesson 
in language.
Of course, silly! chuckled the makers, tousling my 
yellow hair. Oh, grand men they are, the makers of 
Philip Morris, just as full of natural goodness as the 
cigarettes they make. Of course, fond boy, you may 
occasionally forego levity in this column and instead use 
it for a short lesson in language! said the makers and 
tossed me up and down in a blanket until, rosy with 
laughing, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins 
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs 
until the campfire had turned to embers.

TTE 0Oom
WFor our first lesson in language, let us take up 
French, which has often been called the lingua franca 
of France. We will approach French in a new manner, 
because, to be brutally frank, the way it is taught in our 
colleges is archaic and obsolete. Why all this emphasis 
on grammar? After all, when we get to France does it 
matter if we can parse and conjugate? Of course not!
So for the first exercise, translate the following real, 
true-to-life dialogue between two real, true-to-life French
men named Claude (pronounced Clohd) and Pierre (also 
pronounced Clohd):
CLAUDE: Good morning, sir. Can you direct me to 
the nearest monk?
PIERRE: I have-regret, but I am a stranger here 
myself.
CLAUDE: Is it that you come from the France?
PIERRE: You have right. 
CLAUDE: I also. Come, let us mount the airplane 
and return ourselves to the France.
PIERRE: We must defend from smoking until the 
airplane raises itself.
CLAUDE: Ah, now it has raised itself. Will you have 
a Philippe Maurice?
PIERRE: Mercy.
CLAUDE: In the garden of my aunt it makes warm 
in the summer and cold in the winter.
PIERRE: What a coincidence. In the garden of my 
aunt too!
CLAUDE: Ah, we are landing. Regard how the air
plane depresses itself.
PIERRE: What shall you do in the France?
CLAUDE: I shall make a promenade and see various 
sights of cultural and historical significance. What shall 
you do?
PIERRE: I think I shall try to pick up the stewardess.
CLAUDE: Long live the France!

Bagpipe Section 
Of Kiltie Band
By Barbara Fisher
Anyone going to the Carnegie 
Tech football games will see the 
high-stepping and smart looking 
Kiltie Band. Dressed in their 
Scottish uniforms, the band pro
vides a unique type of entertain
ment during their half-time show.
Wednesday, after everyone is in 
his propore position, the drum ma
jor blows his whistle and the band 
comes alive with a spirited march. 
Following a very tedious first re
hearsal, the band is dismissed un
til Friday, the last rehearsal day.
On Friday, things seem to go a 
little better and it looks as though 
an enjoyable half-time show will 
be presented.
The band is to be congratul
ated on its performances,* says 
Professor K. J. Chone, visiting 
professor on industrial admini
stration from Scotland. The band 
is a most impressive sight and I 
know how difficult it is to play 
those bagpipes. The results are 
surprisingly good.

Russia in 1917, who drove home 
the opposite definition of imperi
alism as simply the desperate 
moves of declining capitalism.
Many of us here, naturally im
pressed with the achievements of 
American technology in Arabian 
oil fields, have tended to side 
rather with Lenin in saying that 
the British and French excitement 
over Nassers seizure of the canal 
is due primarily to their depend
ence on Middle East oil. But when 
the two countries struck at Suez 
they were content to expose the 
oil production facilities to sabot
age and seizure. And French 
newspapers look on Nasser prin
cipally as the Hitler behind the 
desperate Arab-French civil war 
in Algeria, a land which they 
cherish as constitutionally part of 
metropolitan France itself.
The propagandist argument that 
Nasser is a Hitler can, in fact, 
point to the confused idealism and 
expansionist nationalism in, for 
example, his book Egypts Lib
eration, The Philosophy of the 
Revolution. It is more enlighten
ing to read in the October At
lantic Monthly a quiet analysis 
by Professor Hamilton Gibb, who 
is uniquely competent in Moslem 
history: Arab society today has 
lost its inner structure and is pro
foundly torn between opposing 
impulses toward authoritarianism 
and toward some new organic ex
pression of Moslem values.

But the wider problem of im
perialism, and its ambivalence, 
perhaps springs principally from 
a century-long disparity of bar
gaining power: at least for the 
hundred years that began to wane 
with the Russo-Japanese War in 
1904, the non-Westerner was 
held at a hopeless all-around dis
advantage. The civilizers right
eous aims, whether of keeping 
order or of making deserts fruit
ful, are thus by now hardly more 
than added weapons of superior
ity, in the eyes of people slowly 
determining not to be pushed 
around longer. So Israel finds her
self among peoples prepared only 
for intransigence.
The tragedy in Hungary, by 
contrast, seems starkly simple. 
Over most of the ninety years 
since they struck their bargain 
with the Hapsburgs as an aftermath of Bismarcks success, the 
Hungarians have appeared before 
world opinion as insistently rul
ing, or claiming to rule, over their 
immediate Slavic neighbors. The 
Jiistoric separateness of their race 
in the Danube lands presumably, 
however, helped nerve them to 
stand up boldly to the Slavic 
Big Brother  and perhaps 
made it easier for the Russians to 
single them out for a severity of 
treatment that has been ringing 
as an example in the ears of all 
behind the Iron Curtain.

If We Can Help!
In Europe and elsewhere in the world, 
student action has played a large part in 
national politics. In the last century revolu
tions were carried through by large student 
factions and today we see how important 
student influence is in the revolutionary ac
tivity of the Eastern European nations
Here in the United States the freedom 
and security we enjoy makes student politi
cal action unnecessary. Some school papers 
did take stands on the elections, and occa
sionally a student body, through its paper, 
will take an interest in the local city or 
state government.
But the most vehement action taken by 
the student bodies themselves is usually a 
result of football success or fraternity rival
ryand is usually expressed by raids of 
sorts (e.g. panty raids of four or five years 
ago). This doesnt speak especially well for 
American collegians, when our fellow stu
dents are taking part in activities which vi
tally affect their welfare.
Of course there is no need to take action 
against our government, but we should take 
a stand supportingor opposing the student action in other 
parts of the world. Today the activities in any nation may 
directly or indirectly affect the peoples of other nations 
(e.g. that the Hungarians and middle eastern situations will 
have an influence on our future is fairly obvious).
In the letters column is a suggestion by a senior engineer 
for the Student Congress to make a declaration in support 
of the Hungarian student action. We second this suggestion, 
and would to add that in making the declaration, the Coun
cil should consider constructive action, in terms of funds, 
food or any other way we might feasibly help, that we stu
dents can take.

Great Scot!
The latest issue of the Great Scot, which went on sale 
last Friday morning and was completely sold out by after
noon, breaking all Scot sales records, has stirred not a little 
bit of comment on campus. According to tradition, the Tartan 
would like to say a few words about the issue, but, contrary 
to tradition, to speak in behalf of the Scot editorial staff.
While we feel that possibly the magazine violated a few 
of the ethics of a campus humor magazine and of journalism 
in general (and we have seen worse from other coed compuses, not to mention boys schools), we realize that the in
tentions of the staff were not offensive, either to the read
ing public or to the individuals and groups of individuals 
mentioned throughout the magazine.
The intended readers of the Scot were the engineer and 
other men on campus, who make up a largely majority of 
the student body; issues were on sale in Skibo for the benefit 
of the entire campus, of course, but the Scot believed that 
in order to be truly successful, it could not attempt to ap
peal to the entire campus, and focused its attention on the 
male majority.
Names were chosen arbitrarily and not used with any 
intention of malice toward the individuals. If any of the 
readers inferred malintention, it is unfortunate, but let us

Some More Things
Moral Support!
Open Letter to Student Congress:
In view of the recent events in Hungary, par
ticularly in regard to the freedom revolt which was 
spurred on and is being supported by the student 
population of that country, it is my belief that the 
student body of Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
through their Student Congress, should take a posi
tive stand in support of the Hungarian people in 
their struggle for self-determination.
The purpose of such a stand would be to let 
the worldand in particular, the people of Hun
garyknow that the American students are not in
different or unconcerned with this struggle for 
freedom that is being waged against such great 
odds.
Rather than gathering en masse to stomp and 
shout as has been done on some American cam
puses, I feel this stand would be most effective by 
an official declaration from the Student Congress to 
the American and Hungarian delegates and the 
secretary-general of the United Nations.
Respectfully,
H. Donald Moss 
Senior, E&S
Privileges
Editor, the Tartan;
Now that the elections are over, I wish the 
President all the best of luck. However, I question 
the reasons behind this election. That is, did people 
vote for Eisenhower because of his stand on the 
H bomb or the farm situation ,or' because he 
has a better television personality than his former 
opponent?
I second the complain in Miss Kings last edi
torial, and agree that it is important for students 
to discuss the issues before they .vote, and really 
know why they were voting.
All of that is in the past now, but we can still 
take an interest in the policies of the Washington 
administration. We do have the privilege of writ
ing to our congressmen expressing our satisfac
tion or dissatisfaction with those policies, and what 
happens in Washington is important to all of us, 
no matter who is president.
Sincerely,
Henry Rogers 
Junior, E&S

Although Film Arts may pretend to be the Art

Really, Vince!
If youre interested in such things, theres a very 
fine exhibit in Pitts seventh floor fine arts room 
. . . Its called Poetry and Art, and it combines 
some excellent examples of ancient and modern 
art, each coupled with an appropriate poem foJ tl&> 
same period. If you can find your way through 
that enormous front hall theyve got, the exhibition 
is worth seeing.
Final Notefor those who saw the movie about 
Van Gogh, Lust for Life: we saw a wonderful 
cartoon somewhere showing the artist in his beard 
and straw hat being addressed by a young lady. 
The caption said, Vincent, youd be good looking 
if your ears didnt stick out so much.
Perhaps some of you have noticed while wait-* 
ing for the green light to turn red on the welftf 
traveled corner of Forbes and Morewood, the quaint 
little structure which occupies a very prominent 
position between the building construction and the 
Theta Xi house. This has been christened ATO 
B jon. We are very glad that the ATOs pride 
themselves on their divisions A and B.
Nevertheless, they cannot claim sole ownership 
of this cliche. The Betas are organizing A and 
B Greek Sing teams and not to be otdone, the 
PiKAs have not only A and B bridge teamg^ 
but also (catch your breath on this one) C and 
D bridge teams.
Deluxe Park Bench
Are you observent? Did you notive a large 
purple chair in the middle of the cut last week? 
If so, did you try to find out why it was there? 
Perhaps the ROTC men studying the etiquette of 
sitting, a very necessary skill to master, we are 
told. Maybe the girls hockey teams were en
throning their queenly instructors. Maybe ttje 
home management girls were redecorating th' 
house. Are you willing to let this enigma remain 
unsolved?
(Editors note: through a reliable source we 
learned that the chair was deposited in the middle 
of the cut late one night by two roommates who 
could no longer bear to look at it in their room. 
Speculation as to where it has disappeared to seems 
to favor the theory that the home furnishings class 
has rescued it and is recovering it  perhaps the 
roommates lost out on a good thing.)
minEar.lroinThe unpinned among us tend to cry that pin

those men who called a girl they met at some 
informal occasion and asked for a date only to 
receive the retort Sorry, Im pinned! the prop^f 
rebuttal is not Gulp and Not you too?, and 
Gee whillikers! but Best Wishes (as opposed

A bruised and battered Carne
gie Tech football team staged a 
tough battle at Forbes Field last 
Friday night as the Scots lost to 
m Vincent, 21-7.
Three top Tartans saw little or 
no action in the contest because of 
various injuries. Quarterback John 
Tucci has been cut since the F&M 
game because of a broken left 
wrist. Injured early in the St. Vin
cent game were ace halfback, Walt 
Majeski, whose left knee kept him 
out of play the rest of the game, 
and center Jim Temmel, who in
jured his right shoulder early in
0>y.
Highlighting the game was the 
hard-running of Bearcast fullback 
Ed Watkins, who plunged three 
yards in the second quarter and 
ran 69 yards in the fourth for two 
of the St. Vincent tallies. Fullback 
Ross Castrean converted all three 
of the Bearcat scores. Tech half
back Jeep Myers sparked as he 
ran for a total of 135 yards. Tony 
jipul, Tartan guard, showed fine 
>cking on a number of key plays 
while end Ken Ficery played the 
part of an all-around gridiron star, 
catching passes, blocking, and 
tackling, in addition to converting 
after the Scot score.
Cassett Stars
The Tartans scored via the 
quick thinking of end Larry Cas
sett. Cassett, who caught a pass 
from quarterback Jim Muth, wasE
king his way downfield when a 
Vincent player tackled him. In 
a play fit for the pros, Cassett 
deftly lateraled to halfback Leroy 
McElhinny who ran 27 yards for 
the lone Tartan tally.
Tech won the toss and elected 
to kick. Hammers first attempt 
was out of bounds and his second 
kick was returned by Bearcat back 
Willard Fox to the St. Vincent 40. 
A series of fumbles, interceptions 
jid punts followed in which the 
iartans were within scoring 
range, but were unable to advance 
far because of a somewhat deplet
ed offense. Instead of playing the 
usual winged-T formation, the 
Tartan squad employed the A 
formation, playing quarterback 
Muth deep.
The Bearcats opened the scoring 
about midway through the second 
quarter. Tech had the ball on the 
ff'ech 26. On fourth down quarieri/&ck Muth was back in punt for
mation. The pass from center was 
over his head and Muth recovered 
on the 9 where he was downed by 
St. Vincent. Three plays later, big 
Ed Watkins plunged three yards 
for the opening Bearcat score.

Tartans Score
Early in the second half Sul
livan passed to end Shalala for 
the second St. Vincent tally. The 
bearcats made their last touch
down in the fourth quarter when 
ORourke intercepted on the 30. 
On the very next play, behind the 
top-notch blocking of his St. Vin
cent tearrimates, Ed Watkins ran 
70 yards. The extra point was 
good.
With about six minutes to go in 
the game the Tartans started a 
downfield drive from their own 30. 
A series of passes and runs put 
them on the midfield stripe. Quar
terback Muth passed to End Larry 
Cassett who ran 23 yards, then 
lateraled to Halfback Leroy McTartans End Year 
Against Titans 
At New Wilmington
Next Saturday the Tartans play 
the Titans of Westminister, at New 
Wilmington in the last game for 
both teams. The Titans, under 
coach Harry E. Burry, are unde
feated so far this season and will 
be-out to keep it that way. Tech 
stands at three and four and will 
be trying to even the record at 
four and four.
The series between the two 
schools is an old one beginning in
1907. Seventeen contests have been 
played to date and the Tartans 
stand ahead with 11 wins, five 
losses, and one' tie. Last years 
game was postponed because of 
the condition of Forbes Field.

This Saturdays football game at Westminster will decide whether 
this years team, bothered by injuries and bad luck, will finish with 
an even record or a losing record of three wins and five losses. The 
Tartans lost few players from last year and had early season hopes 
of matching or exceeding 1955s seven-one-one record.
Occasionally brilliant performances were turned in by both John 
JTucci and hard-running Tom Briner and end Larry Cassett, but the 
^eam could never seem to get going against the stronger opponents. 
With halfback Walt Majeski either slowed or stopped by a bad 
knee, we lost the opener to Buffalo by one TD, and gave a game 
to Temple three weeks later through interceptions and fumbles. In 
losing 9A0O to F&M two weeks later, passing and defensive ace 
Tuc9i broke his wrist and in falling before St. Vincent under the 
light last Friday we also lost Majeski for the season because he re
injured his ailing knee.
In the interim, Coach Bakers boys rolled up victories over 
John Hopkins, Dickinson, and W&J. Preparing to face strong West
minster without Tucci or Majeski, the Tartans can find consolation 
in looking forward to A15gy We stand to lose only two players, senior 
Briner and Myers, and with a strong contingent of sophomores and 
juniors coming back, Tech should be back on top of the play for 
fun league.
Looking ahead to the basketball season, starting December first, 
prospects are again bright. With four good big men in A1 Frank, 
Charley Goetz, Bud Miller, and Frank Sobolewski, outside men Ru
pert, Ken Ficery, and Boyd Doxstader, and a strong bench, the squad 
is aiming to win the opener with Penn State and is looking forward 
to a winning season, including the first win over de-emphasized drop
ping of West Virginia, the addition of powerful Steubenville, and re
turn of the Steel Bowl Tournament in December.

In games today, Phi Kap plays 
the winner of the ATO-Met Grads 
game and Kappa Sig plays the 
BSR-DTD victor.' Tomorrow the 
all-school champ will be decided 
when the winners of the above 
two games clash. This department 
is picking ATO and the Delts to 
win their fisrt games, but the all
school champ could easily be any
one of the semi-finalists.
The IM victor will play the Duquesne champ, with the winner 
of the Tech-Duquesne tilt meeting 
Pitt for the city title. Tech has 
failed to do well in city competi
tion, but this year may bring a 
reversal of form due to the ex
cellent play exhibited by four or 
five teams.

Win In Tennis
Bridge
Bridge has started play in what 
promises to be an interesting sea
son. We have 14 teams, more than 
ever before, including four teams 
from the defending champ, PiKA. 
Kappa Kappa Gamma has entered 
the first womens team ever to 
play IM bridge. The Obelisks and 
the PiKA Pi and A teams 
will probably be the ones to beat, 
although several dark horses may 
come to the top.
The winning teams must turn 
in scores of their matches within
94 hours or they will forfeit. For 
additional information, see the 
IM bulletin board and office.
Water Polo
Entries are due on November 
AW for water polo, with play to 
start on November 26. Practice 
times are listed on the IM board, 
and must be signed up.
Tennis
In the recently completed ten
nis tournaments, new champs em
erged in both the IM and the all
school tourneys. Ted Fleming, a 
graduate printing management 
student from Peoria, Illinois top
pled Mac Rugheimer 3-6, 8-6, 6-4 
to take the all-school crown. The 
IM title went to Mario Volpe. 
Volpe defeated the unlucky Rug
heimer in straight sets. The IM 
champ is a freshman architect 
from Barrangvilla, Columbia.
Table Tennis
The table tennis entrants have 
been divided into three leagues 
with a total of 19 teams. For 
schedules and phone numbers of 
team managers, see the IM office.

The average lead pencil could 
draw a line some 30 miles long 
(Did you ever see what a little

The bugle like a hunting horn

The giraffe is the tallest of all

The peanut plant is unusual be

Monte Carlo Night 
In Thistle Hall 
On November 17
Do I hear the rattle of dice and 
the clicking of the change wheel? 
Is that some one in the comer 
foretelling the future? Ah yes, its 
Monte Carlo night in Thistle Hall 
on November 17 at 8:30 p.m. and 
sponsored by Student Council. For 
five cents American money where 
else could you get 200 or so in 
play money?
If you tire of gambling you can 
dance to the strains of some pop
ular orchestra via recordings or 
relax and enjoy a coke and pret
zels. If you go broke, you can al
ways buy some more money from 
the can-can girls or are they dance 
hall girls?
At the end of the evening you 
may use your winnings to get 
something at the White Elephant 
Auction. Who knows, you may be 
the holder of the door prize ticket. 
All in all you are sure to enjoy 
yourself, so come one and all and 
bring your friends.
Student Council 
Members On WRCT
Plans for a Monte Carlo and  
report on the recent square dance 
held by Student Council were dis
cussed at an indoctrination meet
ing at the Carnegie Union on No
vember 4.
Mr. Charles Nelson is radio -r
tion WRCT interviewed rde Pres
ident Mary Alice Peterson, Treas
urer Ralph Czernac and Mr. Ed
ward Gascoine. Mr. Gascoine othe president of the University is 
Pittsburgh Evening Student Asso
ciation and he compared his ia
ganization with ours.
It was interesting to note their 
method of selecting members from 
the large student body. It is much 
like a political campaign and 
election whereas Techs is just 
those wishing to join and voicing 
their desire then being voted in. 
Mrs. Gascoine also attended the 
meeting.
After the business discussion, 
colored movies taken at the recent 
Workers Picnic in Universal, 
were shown. The pictures were 
quite interesting especially the 
roll taken by Ralph Czernac and 
accidentally run upside down and 
backwards. Ever see races run 
backwards while standing on your 
head? Byron May and Matt Bertovich also showed their pictures.
A buffet style lunch followed 
the meeting and movies.

we say we want white elephants

few suggestions are jewelry,' writ
ing paper, greeting cards, books, 
ash trays, bric-a-brac, glasses and 
toys. Some new papa may get a 
package containing a baby rattle 
and exclaim, Thats just what I 
wanted.
If you wish to buy an article 
and donate -it or give something 
that is still good but you do not 
wish to keep any longer, wrap it 
and please leave it in Mr. McKelways office. If you are coming to 
the Monte Carlo and would rather 
bring it then, you may do so.
All articles will be greatly ap
preciated. The giver receives al
most as much pleasure as the re
ceiver, and it is difficult to judge 
who gets the biggest kick when 
the package is open. By way of an 
explanation may I say this kind 
of an auction is bidding on a pack-C

Research Date 
The technology department of 
Carnegie Library has announced 
that research data on such indus
trial activities as metals, foods, 
electronics, plastic, chemical, in
struments, fuel, leather, geology, 
and minerology are available to 
Pittsburgh industries, but, as yet, 
are not available to individuals 
who may be interested. However, 
steps are being taken to expand 
the technical information section 
to the point wThere individuals 
can be accommodated.
While on the subject of technol
ogy, a method to see and study the 
complicated stresses in the solid 
steel pressure messed (shell) of a 
power producing nuclear reactor 
has been perfected by a group of 
research scientists.
The technique uses a model 
composed of special plastic to 
make visible the stresses in the 
full scale pressure vessel which 
is a large, complete steel structure 
housing the core of the reactor 
and the inferno of its nuclear 
fire.
The technique will expedite 
speed pressure vessel design. 
Westinghouse research scientists 
are credited with this latest step 
in scientific achievement.

Unified Results
We have decided, the directors 
agreed, that we are going to work 
very closely with all phases of the 
production in order to assure a 
unified result. Since the show is 
a revue, in which the scenes are 
more numerous, we can divide the 
work, directing those parts of the 
show which suit our own interests 
and abilities. The larger scenes 
will be produced co-operatively, 
and each of us will benefit from 
the others viewpoint.
