PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1910
FOOTBALL PROSPECTS
The football season of 1909 was the best in the 
history of Carnegie Tech. The record of how we won 
from Franklin and Marshall and Western Reserve, 
tied with Denison and gave Lehigh one of the tough
est struggles that she has experienced for years is 
beginning to gather dust in the archives. The reputa
tion we made last year is one which will make any 
team hustle to live up to. But our past deeds are but 
memories. With vim and vigor unusual so early in 
the season, Tech warriors are starting out after new 
laurels and the 1910 team promises to be the best 
in the history of the schools.
On Wednesday last, a small squad of a dozen men 
were put through their paces for the first time this 
season. Head Coach Winks Dowling and Coach 
McCulloch gave light work in passing the ball, fall
ing on the ball and other simple exercises. Most of 
the time was spent in explaining a few points in the 
new game and in showing how the work should be 
done rather than doing it.
The new rules, which are putting the best coaches 
in the country on their toes and which are causing 
much worry in the big training camps, could not have 
been better devised to fit the conditions at Tech. 
Fast, snappy, tricky football has always been our 
style and under the new code, things are ideal. 
Elusive, open, brainy football won games for Tech in 
1909 and should gain for her an enviable record this 
year.
Since the opening practice, the squad has increased 
daily until now thirty-five men are being handled by 
the coaches while numbers of new aspirants for grid
iron honors are reporting with every practice. Among
last years Varsity who have reported are Red 
Hatcher, McCorkle, Crawford, and Blair, while Dolan, 
Morris, Kime and Ziringer are expected daily. The 
record these men made last year makes further dis
cussion of their merits useless. Hull, a brawny young 
giant from Marietta Academy, will make a hot fight 
for a baekfield position. He is a punter of no mean 
ability and is clever at passing the ball. Jimmy Tay
lor, former Pittsburgh High star, is showing up 
better than ever, handling the pigskin in masterly 
style. Guy Wehr, the beefy halfback, is back in the 
game, stronger than ever after a summers rest. 
Dewey Dyer, who made a fine struggle for Varsity 
honors last year until he was forced to quit the game 
by a bad ankle, is showing great form in his early 
season work and bids fair to become a Tech standby. 
Wait, the crack half-miler, is in the squad this year. 
His speed will be a big asset in making up a team. 
Engstrom, Hatton and Moorehead, the speedy firstbaseman of last season's baseball team, are all show
ing up well in the preliminaries. In fact, the entire 
squad is working out very much to the satisfaction of 
the coaches who see a very successful season ahead 
for the Skibo lads.
Tech is carrying a heavy schedule this year. How
ever, the formidable task facing us has been much 
alleviated by the good judgment displayed by Man
ager Scott in the placing of the big games in the 
list. Techs schedule follows:
Oct. 1Waynesburg, at home.
Oct. 8Penn State, at State College.
Oct. 15Grove City, at home.
Oct. 22Geneva, at home.

Oct. 29W. & J., at Washington.

Although Pitt, W. & J., State and Lehigh are teams 
of the first water, it is freely predicted that many 
surprises are in store for our heavy opponents when 
the test of brain and brawn comes. Tech has always 
had the reputation of fighting until the last second 
of play and men who know state that the plaid is 
starting out on what should be the most successful 
football season in her career.
OUR FACULTY.
The opening of Carnegie Tech for the year of 
1910-11 marks the passing of some of our institu
tions most able professors, as well as the intro
duction of new men and women who will be respon
sible for the upholding and uplifting of the Carnegie 
policy of continual progress.
Professor William E. Gibbs, B.S., A.M., M.E., of 
the Physics Department, has severed his connec
tion with the Schools in order to perfect a new 
process in the manufacture of copper. Professor 
Gibbs is a graduate of Hobart and Stevens and is 
a recognized authority on acetylene, steam and gas 
patent applications. He has been associated with 
Carnegie Tech ever since the inception of the Schools 
and has brought his department up to the highest 
plane of efficiency. Although we keenly regret his 
departure from our midst, we recognize his intro
duction into a higher field of usefulness and can 
but offer our sincere wishes for his further success.
Professor Martin Hokanson, C.E., of the Strength 
of Materials Department, has resigned his post to 
take up active practice of his profession. He has 
established a testing laboratory in the Phipps Power 
Building, where he will conduct research, as well 
as commercial work in chemical, physical and met
allurgical testing.
Professor Hokanson, who is a graduate of the 
Royal University of Technology, Stockholm, is an 
expert on concrete and building materials, and has 
an enviable record as a testing engineer. He has a 
pleasing personality and will be missed most by 
those who knew him best.
Mr. Frank M. Denton, of the Electrical Depart
ment, resigned in June to take up the position of 
Head of the Electrical Department of Oldchester 
Institute, in England. The institution is one of the 
best known in Europe, due in part to the reputation 
of Professor Drysdale, whom Mr. Denton succeeds. 
Mr. Denton has been with the Schools for three 
years.
APPLIED SCIENCE.
One of the most important changes made in the 
Applied Science faculty is the appointment of Wal
ter F. Knox, Ph. D., as Professor of Physics. Dr.
Knox received his training at the South Kensington 
School of Mines in London, and afterward attended 
the University of Wurtzburg, in Germany. He is 
particularly well-fitted to the field of Mechanics, 
having studied under some of the most eminent 
scholars in Europe. Last year he held the position 
of Associate Professor of Applied Mechanics, which 
work gives him an especially clear insight into the 
work upon, which he is just entering.
Norman C. Riggs, M. S., formerly Assistant Pro
fessor of Mathematics, succeeds Dr.. Knox as Head 
of the Department of Mechanics. Professor Riggs, 
on account of his previous work in the field of Math
ematics, will find no difficulty in keeping his de
partment up to the same high standard that has 
hithertofore existed.
Two new instructors have been appointed in the 
Department of Electrical Engineering. Mr. B. C. 
Dennison, a graduate of Cornell University, has had 
one years experience with the General Electric 
Co., Schenectady, N. Y., and four years work as 
instructor of electrical engineering at his Alma 
Mater. He has earned the titles of S.B. and M.M.
E. during his study at Cornell.
Dr. lHans Riddervold graduated from the Univer
sity of Christiana, Norway, in 1904. He has been 
assistant professor of electrotechnics at the Univer
sity of Hanover, Germany, for four years. He gives 
up a lucrative position as engineer in the test rec
ord department of the Westinghouse Electric and 
Manufacturing Co., at East Pittsburg, to take up his 
work with the Schools.
Mr. F. -M. McCullough has been appointed In
structor in Testing Materials. He graduated from 
the University of Wisconsin in 1903, with the de
gree of B.S. C.E. He has been Instructor in Topo
graphical Engineering at his Alma Mater for six 
years. He has done much original research work 
in concrete and building materials. He succeeds 
Prof. Hokanson.
The Department of Mathematics will be helped by 
the work of Lincoln K. Adkins, A.B. Mr. Adkins 
is a graduate of the University of Nashville, where 
he graduated in 1905. Since then he has spent two 
years at the University of Chicago studying higher 
mathematics. Mr. R. A. Rundle will hold the posi
tion of Assistant Instructor of Mathematics. He is 
a graduate of Colgate University, where he gradu
ated last year with a degree of A.B.
Mr. C. E. Putnam has received the appointment 
of Assistant Instructor in Electrical Engineering. 
He is a graduate of Wooster Polytechnic Institute. 
Mr. E. G. Frazier will be Instructor in Mechanics. 
He has spent several years in the study of higher 
mathematics, in which he takes an especial interest. 
Mr. C. Sproull has been appointed Instructor in De
scriptive Geometry, having full charge of that sub
ject under the direction of Prof. Follows.

THE TARTAN5
APPLIED DESIGN.
The School of Applied Design starts the year 
under very favorable conditions. Professor Sparts, 
head of the Department of Illustration, has just re
turned from three months in Europe, where he has 
been making a study of European methods. Pro
fessor Hewlett, head of the Department of Interior 
Decoration, announces that his department has en
larged its scope and efficiency in a marked degree.
The appointment of George W. Sotter to the 
position of Instructor in Freehand Drawing, will be 
welcome news to those who are interested in that 
branch of work. Mr. Sotter studied at the Penn
sylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia. He 
has traveled in England, France and Italy, where 
he studied painting, stained glass and decoration. 
He has won distinction in art, having had pictures 
hung at the Carnegie exhibitions, St. Louis Pur
chase Exposition, Corcoran Gallery, etc. He is also 
recognized as a master in stained glass decoration, 
having designed windows for many large churches 
and other edifices.
Mr. H. A. Schwab takes up his work as Instructor 
in Architecture. He is a valuable addition to the 
very efficient faculty which has the welfare of the 
School of Applied Design in its keeping.
APPLIED INDUSTRIES.
Although the School of Applied Industries (for
merly the School for Apprentices and Journeymen), 
does not open until October 3, marked activity is ap
parent in every department. The courses have 
been greatly enlarged and widened in scope. Es
pecial attention will be paid to training men for 
positions as foremen and superintendents. Dean 
Connelley is greatly pleased with the outlook and 
expects an overwhelming attendance.
Three new instructors have been appointed. 
Clifford G. Dunnells, C.E., graduate of Lehigh Uni
versity, takes his place as Instructor of Mechanism 
and Materials.
Mr. Dunnells is a native of Pittsburg, and since 
his graduation from the University in 1897, has 
been actively engaged in bridge design work. Mr.
G. A. Bisbee, Assistant Instructor in Chemistry, is 
a Case graduate and is a man who has spent sev
eral years of practical work in the fields of Metal
lurgy and Inorganic Chemistry.
Mr. E. P. Cramer has been appointed Assistant 
Instructor in English. He graduated from Franklin 
and Marshall in 1906 and has been interested in 
public school work up until the present time.
MARGARET MORRISON CARNEGIE SCHOOL.
Never in the history of the M. M. C. S. have con
ditions been as favorable to progress and extension 
as they are this year. Applications for admission 
have been coming in at an unprecedented rate.
Never before has such a large number of States 
been represented.
Six new instructors have been appointed to the 
School. Miss Josephine Compton Bray will take 
charge as 'Head of the Department of English and 
History. Miss Bray was graduated from Smith 
College, where she won the degree of A.B. She has 
studied extensively in England and on the conti
nent besides having spent six years as Head of the 
Department of English and German at Quincey 
Mansion School, Quincey, Mass.
Miss Elizabeth Vermocken has been appointed 
Instructor in History. She comes from one of the 
oldest Pittsburg families and is very well known 
for her literary work in the field of sociology and 
education.
Miss Barbara Stannard will take her place as In
structor in Dressmaking. She received her educa
tion in Europe and has had years of valuable ex
perience in her specialty.
The new Instructor in Costume and Drawing De
sign, Miss Ethel Ernst, is a graduate of Pratt In
stitute, where she has done much original work in 
costume design and pattern modeling.
Miss Estella Biedenbach, Instructor in Mathe
matics, comes from Bryn Mawr, where she gradu
ated in 1908. Since then she has taught German, 
History, and Zoology in the schools of Butler, her 
home city.
Miss Alline Speer, Assistant Instructor in Chem
istry, is a graduate of Vassar College, and is an 
expert along lines of physiological and organic 
chemistry. Her appointment will strengthen what 
has already proven itself one of the strongest and 
most thorough departments in the M. M. C. S., under 
the able direction of Professor Edmond Esquerre.
Miss Mabel C. Farren has been appointed Parttime Instructor in Drawing and Costume Design, 
She is a graduate of the School of Art, Allegheny.
Miss Hartman and Miss Merrill, last years M. M. 
C. S. graduate, have also been placed upon the fac
ulty.
THE HOBBLE SKIRT AT NORTHWESTERN.
Advices from Northwestern University state that 
tile ban of public disapproval has been placed upon 
the hobble skirt, notwithstanding the fact that that 
institution is famed as possessing the prettiest and 
best-dressed co-eds in the world. Northwestern 
girls have decided to walk instead of hopping to 
classes. Of course, some of the ultra-fashionable 
young ladies will kick, but the kick will be a weak 
one, especially if performed while the objector is 
clothed in one of the barred garments. It will prob
ably amount to nothing more than a wriggle. The 
faculty is strongly opposed to the introduction of 
freak styles by girl students and the result of fac
ulty influence "combined with strenuous objections 
by the male students will beno hobbles.

SCHOOL SPIRIT.
In the olden days when the earth was younger and 
the Greeks and Romans ruled the world, the scholars 
who studied under a certain ancient philosopher of 
immortal fame gave as their only authority for their 
beliefs, Ipse dixit (He hath said it). That was the 
beginning of school spirit. From then until now has 
it existed. True, the Roman and the Greek showed 
his spirit in a different manner than we do. He 
possessed pride in an individual; we possess pride in 
an institution. At the bottom they are one.
School spirit is one of the most vital factors in the 
life of an educational institution. Without it school 
becomes a place of drudgery and work, students be
come machines and student life is mere existence. 
With it, school-work becomes a pleasure, because the 
tediousness of study is lost in the endeavor to make 
our school the best school. Man cannot advance if 
he does not possess a certain enthusiasm in his work. 
The spirit to help and uplift will go further towards 
making our leisure hours happy and our hours of 
work bearable than any other thing.
A new class is entering Carnegie Tech. It is a 
class of fine, stalwart-looking men. Nineteen Four
teen, show your brothers what sort of stuff you are 
made of. Organize! Get your class together! Then 
start in to do something for Tech. Learn our yells, 
that you may root and cheer our teams to victory.. 
Learn the college songs, the Alma Mater and the 
Amici, that you may sing the praises of Carnegie to 
the skies. Come out for the teams. Take an active 
part! Do not be a stand-patter. Action is progress.
Inaction is death. Be up and doing, but above all, 
dont forget that you are men, college men, Carnegie 
Tech men!
THE RETURN.
Not the least of the joys of getting back to school 
is the meeting of old friends and the discussions as 
to how the summer months have been spent. It is a 
joyous sight to see a bunch of old chums meet on 
the stairs or in the hallways, shaking hands, laugh
ing, shouting, all talking at once. What did you 
do this summer? Where have you been? and 
other queries fill the air while everyone tries to tell 
how he toiled or loafed or went camping, as the case 
may be. Sometimes it seems worth the separation, 
just to get together for those first golden moments 
of reunion. Everyone is happy. Everyope is goodnatured. No one cares for exams or classes and 
school tedium is forgotten in the pure joy of conjenial companionship. Ah, college years are the 
gladsome years!
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.
The Department of Health, with Mr. J. H. McCulloch at the head, is a new departure at Carnegie 
Tech. Mr. McCulloch is a graduate of Springfield 
Training School, Springfield, Mass. He took a very 
prominent part in school athletics at that institu
tion, being captain of the foot-ball team for 1909. 
The new department will have as its primary ob
ject the improvement and upbuilding of the student 
bcdy, physically, incidentally working up a greater 
interest in Varsity sports as a means to that end. 
Mr. McCulloch will have entire charge of the work. 
Inter-class and inter-school athletics will be encour
aged and fostered. Members of incoming (Plebe) 
classes and all students coming into the Schools 
with advanced standing will be required to undergo 
a rigorous physical examination when they enter 
and will not be advanced at the end of the term 
unless they can show improvement in their physical 
condition. Gymnasium classes will be held in the 
new gym as soon as it is completed, although at
tendance will not be compulsory. The new depart
ment is a continuation of the Carnegie policy of 
a healthy mind in a healthy body, and is one of 
the best of recent innovations at Tech.
The new gymnasium, under the able direction of 
Consulting Engineer R. G. Lose, is fast being com
pleted. The building is of re-inforced concrete and 
will contain dressing rooms for the various teams 
as well as a fine gymnasium floor and baths. It 
will be finished some time in October. The build
ing of the gymnasium means not only a good basket
ball team at Tech this winter, but a basket-ball 
team which will pay.
Those awful re-exams are more potent than any 
magnet in getting fellows back to school early.

On September 19th, the M. M. C. S. opened its 
doors to a large number of students all eager for 
the work and pleasure which the season has in store 
for them.
Dean West has returned from her trip in Europe 
very much refreshed and full of interesting stories 
of the Carnegies and her lovely visit with them.
The Woodlawn Club had a large sign Qf welcome 
out for the M. M. C. S. girls Monday morning, and 
it was surely appreciated by the girls who antici
pate a feeling of good fellowship all around this 
year.
Although the girls have not a gymnasium build
ing in the process of construction, they intend to be 
quite as athletic in their way as the boys. The ten
nis court has been enlarged and dates are being 
made ahead for its occupation during the noon hour 
and after school.
Schedules have been mad' but for all the classes 
and work planned for the very first hours so that no 
valuable moments will be lost. The crowds around 
the bulletin boards showed that the girls were not 
going to class the first day with a not prepared or 
I didnt know, or I havent any pencil. Not that 
these remarks are ever heard from the Juniors or 
Seniors, but then, you know, the Plebes have some
times a tendency to make mistakes on the first day. 
And speaking of Plebes, we might inform the gen
eral public that they are really very dear little girls 
and the upper class girls feel that it will be a pleas
ure to guide their faltering footsteps through our 
ctately halls of learning.
The Seniors are looking especially fine this year. 
They have profited greatly from the two years worK 
ard certainly deserve their high standing.
The Juniors come forward as a close second to 
the honorable Seniors. They are very bright giris 
ard will, if they try, prove worthy successors of this 
years class.
Altogether the M. M. C. S. is in fine shape for the 
years work and hope to make it one of the most 
successful years in the schools history.

Now as most of us safely settle ourselves back 
in snug, old Skiboland, we can gaze out at last years

thank our lucky stars that we are on the inside

The conversation turned, as it sometimes will, on 
the subject of girls. Take a look at this one, said 
one of the group, pulling out about ten different 
views of the same young lady, small photos such as 
are sold by enterprising gentlemen at county fairs 
for the munificent sum of ten cents per dozen, a 
dozen different poses for a dime. Nice, a peach 
and other similar remarks were passed. One young 
fellow, a Junior Civil, had not been paying much 
attention to the proceedings. Let me see them, 
he said, reaching for the photos. After gazing at the 
pictures for a couple of minutes he remarked, point
ing out his choice with his finger, I think this one 
is the best looking girl in the bunch. And then he 
wondered why the rest of the fellows laughed.
He was a football man and looked absolutely dis
gusted with life. Whats the matter, Jimmie? in
terrogated a friend and admirer, solicitously placing 
his hand on the athletes forehead. Matter? ex
claimed the weary one. Why, all last summer, no 
one even as much as offered me a toby. Now that I
am in training------- he stopped to spit viciously,
Why thunder, Ive been offered three good cigars in 
the last half hour. Oh, its great to have friends.

GLEE CLUB NOTICE.
This year the club is going to get an early start and 
will make itself one of the leading clubs in the East.
At a meeting of the executive committee, held Sun
day, September 19th, it was decided to secure the 
services of one of the best glee club directors in the 
country, also to secure one of the four best mandolin 
players in the world to help make the club a success 
this year.
This is a great opportunity for the students of Car
negie Tech and every student who can sing or play a 
string instrument should join with us for his own 
benefit and for the benefit of the club.
Watch bulletin boards for announcement of first 
try out and be on hand to help all you can.

THE PLEBE.
Who is it enters college life 
To motley tune of drum and fife? 
Whose greenness cuts you like a knife? 
The Plebe.
Who is it comes with trembling air, 
With mind made up to do and dare,
To beard the Sopho in his lair?
The Plebe.
Who wears an old straw-lid passe,
Upon the registration day------
And then bareheaded wends his way? 
The Plebe.
Who is it thinks the Sophs are nice 
Until some day they him entice 
Into a bath-tub full of ice?
The Plebe.
Who is it grinds for hours galore 
Until the first few weeks are oer 
Then never studies any more?
The Plebe.
But though he be a verdant lout,
Or suckling fresh or stoic stout,
Oh, college would be dull without 
The Plebe!
The general outlook in all the Schools is most 
encouraging. There is a general increase of 20

INSURANCE AGAINST RAIN.
The daily papers recently referred briefly to a re
port from the American consul-general in London on 
a form of insurance that was said to be becoming 
common in England, viz., insuring people who are 
going on a holiday against the occurrence of wet 
weather. It was stated that underwriters will in
sure against one-tenth of an inch of rain falling on 
more than two days in a week in any towns on the 
east and south coasts of England. Upon the pay
ment of a small sum a policy is issued for ten days, 
under which it is agreed to pay the person insured 
at the rate of $2.43 a day in excess of two wet days. 
If higher compensation is desired, a higher premium 
is charged.
The scope of wet weather insurance is, however, 
much wider than would be inferred from the abovementioned newspaper paragraph, and is fully set 
forth in an article by H. J. Gooding in the current 
number of Symonss Meteorological Magazine. Wet 
weather frequently results in financial loss to the 
promoters of agricultural, horse, or flower shows, 
fetes, athletic meetings, pageants, fireworks, etc., 
and all these are now commonly insured against it 
at Lloyds. The premium for an insurance against 
a rainfall of one-tenth of an inch during a day of 12 
hours or less in the summer months, June to Sep
tember, has been fixed at 20 to 25 per cent., accord
ing to the part of the country involved. This is for 
the simple risk of rainfall, which in point of fact, 
however, is seldom asked for, the common form 
being an indemnity against loss through rainfall, 
viz., against the receipts for admission falling short 
of the expenses of the venture in consequence of
rain. A higher premium is charged for the latter 
form of policy, as it involves a second consideration 
the attractiveness of the meeting and its power to 
draw gate money in spite of wet weather. It is 
usual to stipulate that the premium must be paid 
three days before the day insured; so that the pol
icy holder can hardly be aided in deciding whether 
insurance is advisable by the announcements of the 
clerk of the weather or his own weather wisdom.

DYNAMO BUILDING AN EXACT SCIENCE.
The days of the cut and dry method in dynamo 
designing have long been left behind, at least in so 
far as our customary types of generators are con-' 
cerned. Planning them has become a most exact 
science in which every factor entering into the de
sign must be carefully considered and in which 
every effect can be closely estimated before the real 
building begins.
For instance, in armatures it is generally desired 
the the temperature after running for hours at full 
load shall not exceed 140 F. (or 60 C.) and as the 
resistance of the wire increases with the tempera
ture, this resistance has to be figured for the ex
pected maximum temperature. Then allowances 
have to be made for the cooling influence of the air 
on the outer layer (or for air-cooling in a ventilated 
armature), for the heating due to eddy currents set 
up in both the copper winding and the armature 
core, and for heating due to magnetic hysteresis. 
These factors are all interwoven with each other, 
also with the shapes and sizes of the field magnet 
and its polepieces; these relationships have been 
worked out in the form of fairly exact curves and 
formulas, by which the designed can be guided. 
That is why so highly efficient types can be de
signed on short notice, for it is only an exact art 
that permits the ready obtaining of pre-determined 
resu.ts.Popular Electricity.

PLEBE VODEVIL.
In the morning and afternoon of registration day 
the incoming Plebes, under the able direction of the 
Sophomores, performed before a large audience. 
The wealth, the beauty and the fashion of the 
Schools were all in attendance. Comments and 
suggestions from the onlookers were many and 
merry and, as a consequence the Plebes were led a 
lively dance. This is not a mere figure of speech as 
many were politely requested to exhibit their skill 
in this line.
The first part of the program consisted of singing, 
dancing and talking acts. For this stunt many were 
called but few were applauded. Each performer 
gave his prep school yell as an encore. When this 
was given with the spirit demanded by Cheer Lead
er Gearhart, he was allowed to go on his way re
joicing.
Later in the afternoon the production became 
more varied. Several crews were organized for the 
edification of Mr. Pfouts, who viewed things from 
the gallery.
Three-legged and wheelbarrow races were then 
in order. In the latter, each team consisted of a 
cargo and two strong-arm men. The penalty for 
dumping the cargo was chastisement at his hands. 
This was inflicted in only one case to the great de
light of the assemblage. A dancing bear act by 
two Plebes was also well received.
As a finale a one-act play of considerable heart 
interest was produced. The title was: I have the 
time, and the place, but its gosh danged hard to 
get the girl. The hero was costumed in the con
ventional knickerbockers and reversed coat of the 
day. The heroine employed in the office of the H. 
& J. building. The hero entered, gazed upon her, 
an^ was conquered. He fell upon his knees, gazed 
into her orbs of liquid light and cried: I love you, 
darling! Wilt thou marry me?
Needless to say, he was politely, but firmly turned 
down.
Many other stunts were arranged, some funny, 
some ridiculous, some pathetic. At any rate, the 
day was distinctly ala Soph. Whether or not the 
Plebes will come back Friday is now the question 
of the day.

 N THE WEE, 8MA' HOURS.
In this country the average landlord either turns 
the hall lamps off altogether at midnight, or else 
leaves only a very dim illumination. The German 
owner of apartment buildings is perhaps wiser, for 
he considers the dim lighting insufficient and yet 
uoes not want to light the halls brightly all night 
long. What he does is to light the halls and stair
cases brightly until midnight, after which time a sys
tem of pushes enables any late comer to turn on all 
the lights for a period of three minutes, at the end 
of which time the lights go out automatically.
The whole system of hall and stair lights is con
trolled by a pendulum clock so adjusted as to turn 
the hall lamps on and off at the desired hours. In 
turning them off it switches the current to the emer
gency lighting c;rcuit which is controlled by a push
button at each stair landing. Pressing any button 
operates a little elock-switcn which turns on all the 
stair lights and automatically turns them, off again 
at the end of three minutes, though the time can be 
adjusted to a shorter or longer period if desired.

GERMAN MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
Recently in the Reichstag, the lower house of the 
German Imperial Parliament, Herr Ledebour, a 
Socialist, submitted a startling resolution. It de
manded that the Imperial Chancellor be made re
sponsible to the Reichstag for his administration. 
Thai administration includes participation in all the 
Emperors political acts. Herr Ledebour declared 
that the power of autocratic decision must be taken 
out of the Sovereigns hands. He even added that no 
one within the limits of the Courts entourage, what
ever Ilia talents, can properly supervise important 
public affairs. The resolution was passed by a sub
stantial majority, which probably would have been 
larger had the proposer not been a Socialist. It is 
surprising that such a resolution has not been intro
duced long before this. It is the logical completion 
of the movement begun a year and a half ago by the

agitation following a letter from the Emperor pub
lished by the London Telegraph. In it William II 
expressed himself with uncommon freedom even for 
him. The affair made a great stir. At that time 
Prince von Bulow was Chancellor. He was moved to 
exclaim that it would be impossible for him or any 
other Minister to conduct the governments affairs if 
the Kaiser insisted on acting in entire independence 
and irresponsibility. To his credit, the sovereign 
with characteristic acuteness grasped the situation. 
From that time to this he has curbed his public utter
ances. But a more important event followed. Ac
cording to official explanation, Prince von Bulow re
signed, not because his financial measures failed of 
passage, but because his health was not equal to the 
task of dealing with the Reichstag. Doubtless the 
latter statement was true, but doubtless the Chan
cellors political health was also not adequate. In 
any event, his retirement was significant, because it 
was the first retirement of a German Chancellor im
mediately after the Reichstag had rejected a govern
ment bill. That, in our opinion, constitutes a his
toric event. Then followed something equally signifi
cant. The new Chancellor, Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, accepted the finance plan of the Reichstag ma
jority, a plan rejected by his predecessor. Thus the 
loss of a majority in that body had been followed, 
not only by a change of ministers, but by the im
position of the majoritys policy on the new Chan
cellor. And thus, for the first time in Germany, the 
principle of ministerial responsibility came into prac
tical operation.
