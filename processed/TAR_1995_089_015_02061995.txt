University evicts Pi Lambda Phi
Tragic death results in repercussions against fraternity
By EDWARD HAYES
Tartan News Editor
Pi Lambda Phi fraternity must vacate 
its house by mid-semester due to the 
tragic death of Justin Chambers on De
cember 11.
Michael Murphy, Dean of Student 
Affairs, said, The current residents will 
move from the house by mid-semester. 
These repercussions stemmed from 
Chambers death. He was a second-year 
Materials Science and Engineering stu
dent who died of alcohol poisoning dur
ing a private Christmas party held at 
PiLam before the mid-semester break. 
Chambers, whose Blood-Alcohol Con
centration was 0.54, was a brother in the 
fraternity.
The move had been speculated for some 
time before Murphy served the official Dave Perry/Tartan Photo Staff Manager eviction notice to the house this past
By mid-semester, Pi Lambda Phi will have to leave its house because of the death of week. The brothers under the age of 21 
a brother last semester. attending the party received internal
citations for underage drinking, must 
serve 25 hours of community service, 
and are on disciplinary probation for one 
year. Brothers over 21 face misdemeanor 
criminal charges for serving alcohol to a 
minor.
Murphy said, The organization will 
still continue to be recognized and will 
be able to participate in Carnival and 
Greek Sing and other student activi
ties. As long as they still have their 
charter, Chris Cenkener, president of 
the Greek Council, said they will still 
recognize PiLam. Carnegie Mellon can
not remove their charter, he said, Only 
their national. The national president 
of PiLam was unavailable for comment.
Cenkener expressed his enthusiasm 
that PiLam continues to participate in 
student events on campus, I really hope 
they can [participate in Greek Sing and 
Carnival]. It is unknown whether or 
not PiLam will take part in these events. 
The president of the house was unavail
able for comment. As of right now there 
has not been any definite determination 
about who will move into PiLams house. 
For now, the brothers are permitted to 
keep some of their belongings in the 
building for the remainder of the semes
ter. Cenkener was unsure what would 
become of PiLams house. He did say 
that it would remain Greek. My specu
lation is that Sig Tau would move in. 
Erik Witte, president of Sig Tau, has not 
heard anything official. The house 
hasnt been offered to us, he said.
For now, PiLam must prepare to move 
into campus housing. The University 
said that they will assist the brothers 
any way they can in the move. This 
includes furnishing everyone with a room 
and providing parking permits.
Murphy praised the PiLam brothers 
for their attitude throughout these 
events. These guys have shown a great 
deal of character in dealing with a very 
difficult situation.
Drama Dept, head steps down
By BILL VANDERMARK
Tartan Staffwriter
Its a sad thing to say goodbye, 
but after nine years of being head 
of the Carnegie Mellon Drama 
Department, thats exactly what 
Elisabeth Orion is doing. She will 
step down from her position, this 
summer, to return to full time 
teaching at Carnegie Mellon.
Regarding 
the move, 
she said, I 
think that 
nine years is 
long enough.
I love the 
University, 
but being the 
head of the 
Drama De
partment is a 
24-hour-aday job. It 
doesnt leave much time for any
thing else. I also love teaching 
and will be happy to return.
Orion became the head of the 
Drama Department in 1987, 
when former head Mel Shapiro 
vacated the position. She has 
implemented many changes since 
then, and feels that it is time for 
a change. She has many projects 
waiting in the wings to occupy 
her time.
In addition to going back to
teaching full time, she will still 
be the head of the Graduate 
Drama Department working in 
conjunction with CMU/MXAT. 
She also has some writing that 
she would like to get back to. She 
said, First and foremost, I am an 
actress and I want to get back to 
acting. Its not hard to see why. 
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
named her Performer of the Year
for 1990-91 for her performance 
in the City Theaters Road to 
Mecca.
Orion did not have a clear pic
ture of what will become of the 
Drama Department, I think that 
will depend solely on whomever 
takes the position. The depart
ment is doing both an internal 
and external search to locate pos
sible replacements. I also dont 
think that theres any advice I 
could give them. They will need
to find their own way. The Drama 
Department is in a strong posi
tion right now, and I hope that it 
will keep growing and expand
ing.
The process for locating a 
replacment Drama Head is cur
rently under way.
A search committee has been 
established. Members include 
Barbara Anderson, Associate 
Dean of CFA, 
Cletus Anderson, 
associate Drama 
professor, Donald 
Wadsworth, asso
ciate Drama pro
fessor and Cynth
ia Limauro, an
other associate 
Drama professor.
Two possible in
ternal replace
ments are Don 
Marinelli, the as
sociate head of drama, and Gre
gory Lehane, the head of direct
ing. Neither was available to 
comment on the situation.
Students are a little wary of the 
change. Rashad Carter, a sopho
more in the Drama Department, 
said, I wont know what its go
ing to be like until the replace
ment gets here. Until then things 
run like normal. Until a replace
ment is selected, things will run 
as they have been.
/ think that nine years is long 
enough. I love the University: I also 
love teaching and will be happy to 
return.

Swimming pool defects trouble users
By HEATHER ZINDLE
Tartan Staffwriter
Many students returned to campus, 
from winter break to find signs in the 
gym announcing the pool was closed. 
What seemed like a simple drain prob
lem last July, was much bigger than 
anticipated, said Joan Maser, associate 
athletic director.
Maser said that the pool is inspected 
twice a year by the County Health De
partment, and last July the pool was 
found to have the wrong type of floor 
drain. It had to be replaced by an anti
vortex drain, which is covered.
Carnegie Mellon was given 30 days to 
correct the problem. This was not fea
sible, however, so CMU received an ex
tension until December, after classes 
and finals were over.
Maser also said that there were leak
age problems in the basement after 
draining the pool. The outside mainte
nance company that has worked on the Tim Knlveton/Tartan photographer pQol for about 1Q years suggested that
Joan Maser conducts a swimming class In the gym's pool. Drainage and leakage the pool needed grouting work, which 
Problems have frustrated pool users recently. had not been done since the company
started servicing the pool. With all these 
factors combined, it was decided that 
December was the best time to do all the 
work.
Companies that gave bids for the 
project said it would take seven to 10 
days. However, the project ended up 
lasting five more days, and was finally 
completed on January 9.
The pool was then refilled, but there 
was still the leaking problem that the 
grouting did not correct. It sealed itself 
up in a week and lost about a foot of 
water a day during the process. In the 
meantime, there was a problem with the 
clarity of the water. The swim team 
came back on January 12 to find out 
they had to practice at Pitt.
Maser said she understands the frus
tration, and apologizes for any inconve
nience. They were working on getting 
the chemicals balanced, which took two 
weeks instead of one, because the chlo
rine content was too high, and the iron 
content of the city water gave the pool a 
greenish tinge.
Recreation swimming was not allowed 
for safety reasons, for it was hard to see,
especially in the deep end. The swim 
team did use the pool, however, and also 
practiced at Pitt. The pool was still los
ing about three inches of water a day, 
which accounts for 3,000 gallons.
Maser said, There are more problems 
that need to be addressed, if we continue 
to lose water.
As of January 29, the pool opened. 
However, last week another crack at the 
bottom of the pool was found and re
paired. There is some speculation that 
the leaking problem lies in the pipes of 
the draining system that is encased and 
underneath the pool, where no work has 
ever been done.
As of March 1, there will be even more 
work done at the gym, as the first phase 
of the renovation project scheduled to 
continue until October will be under
way. The locker rooms and equipment 
room will close, and there are plans for 
the men to use locker facilities in the 
basement of Donner. The only entrance 
to the pool will be at the back of the gym.
Maser said, there are plans to keep the 
pool operating, even after the opening of 
the Student Center.

THIS JUST IN
Dra mrerpt,hrdso wd 
nwh,otd hSimri glor
LOS ANGELES, February 3 (DJ) 
. There have been several new develop
ments in the O.J. Simpson murder 
case.
The day after his ex-wi fe was slashed 
. to death, O.-J. Simpson said he had 
dreams of killing her, a friend testi
fied.
He jokingly said, To be honest,
. Shipp, Ive had some dreams of killing 
her,  former police officer Ronald 
. .Shipp said during Simpsons double
murder trial.
, When asked about, the number of 
! dreams by Deputy District Attorney 
; Chris Darden, Shipp answered, He 
just said dreams, plural.
Shipp, who retired from the police 
department five years ago, said he 
, didnt tell investigators about the conversation.
I was in a state of shock up until 
that time, he said. I wanted nothing 
t to do with it. I was thinking it was a 
j dream,likemostofAmerica. Ithought 
. it was harmful.
Shipp also said Simpson told him he 
was defending himself from his wifes 
attacks during their New Years 1989 
argument, and that it began while 
they were having sex.
Shipp testified that Simpson told 
him he and his wife had been drinking 
on New Years Eve. They got into an 
argument when they returned home.
They were making love and I guess 
Nicole had wanted to stop for what
ever reasons and they began to argue, 
,Shipp said. Simpson told him she was 
^the aggressor and came after him and 
that he was acting in self-defense. 
Shipp, who once taught new officers 
] about domestic violence, said Simpson 
told him he didnt really hit her. 
Later, Shipp testified about 
Simpsons conversation about the 
dream. It wasnt immediately clear 
why he was allowed to be questioned 
about it with the jury present.
Shipp took the stand after Judge 
Lance Ito ruled Shipp could tell the 
jury about the Simpsons relationship, 
but riot about the dream.
Later, Shipp acknowledged that he 
juffered an alcohol problem, saw a 
sychiatrist and left his police job be:ause of stress.
Shipp also said he often brought 
fellow police officers by Simpsons
* 'house to show off Simpsons football 
J trophies, but denied any of those offic' 'ers wasDetectiveMark Fuh rman, who 
Kvould later say he found a bloody
f0
glove at Simpsons house.
Shipp testified in the second day of 
relentless cross-examination by the 
defense, which was trying to discredit 
him by port^ang him as a lying ce
lebrity trying to advance his acting 
career by linking himself to the 
Simpson case.
Later, when requestioned by the 
prosecution, Shipp said he was, in 
fact, a close friend of Simpsons  he 
arranged security for Nicole, as well 
as arranged her funeral and was one 
who never asked O.J... .for anything.
To this very day, I dont have an 
autographed picture ofO.J. Simpson, 
said Shipp. He said he has refused to 
take money to tell his story about the 
dream conversation. I personally felt 
that was blood money, said Shipp.
Under questions from lawyer Carl 
Douglas, Shipp insisted he was telling 
the truth when he said Simpson told 
him about dreams of killing his in a 
conversation the day after her murder 
and that of her friend, Ronald 
Goldman.
Douglas suggested, however, that 
Shipp was lying, asserting that Shipp 
recounted Simpson discussing the 
bloody glove allegedly found on 
Simpsons property even though, at 
the time, police had not told Simpson 
about the glove.
A new witness has told attorneys 
that he saw four men near Nicole 
Simpsons home the night she and a 
friend were slashed to death.
Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, 
Jr. complained to Judge Ito that pros
ecutors had failed to turn over their 
interview with Leif Tilden.
Tilden saw four men near Bundy 
Drive between 10 and 10:30 pm the 
night Nicole Simpson and Goldman 
were slain, Cochran said.
He asked the judge to order pros
ecutors to turn over their interview 
with Tilden.
Prosecutor Chris Darden said a rep
resentative of the district attorneys 
office had interviewed Tilden less than
24 hours earlier and he had signed off 
today on papers that would be given to 
the defense.
He added that Tilden said the four 
young men appeared to be college stu
dents.
Another witness who claimed to see 
four men in the area about the same 
time was Mary Anne Gerchas, whose 
credibility came under attack last 
week.

Clinton proposes wages increase
WASHINGTON, February 3 (DJ)  
Despite strong resistance from Republi
can leaders in Congress, President 
Clinton is expected to propose that the 
minimum wage be raised by 90 cents an 
hour to $5.15 over two years.
The plan, which is expected to be un
veiled this morning by the President 
along with Democratic congressional 
leaders, comes after days of consulta
tions between the White House and Capi
tol Hill.
House Republican leader Dick Armey 
of Texas and others in the GOP have 
made clear that they firmly oppose any 
sort of increase in the current $4.25-anhour wage floor. Their resistance makes 
it unlikely that the Presidents plan will 
go very far.
Democratic leaders, meanwhile, had 
indicated to the White House that they 
could support either of two options: an 
increase of 50 cents an hour the first 
year and 25 cents the next, or an in
crease of 45 cents an hour at first and 
another 45 cents a year later.
Although Clinton had for weeks been 
leaning toward the first formula, White 
House aides said that as of late yester
day he was preparing to go with the 90- 
cent increase. The change, they said, 
reflected the preference of congressional 
Democrats who wanted to shoot for the 
higher number.
The plan would include no further 
increases to account for inflation, an 
idea that administration officials had 
considered.
Mike McCurry, the Presidents spokes
man, said yesterday that the White 
House and lawmakers were quickly 
moving toward a proposal the adminis
tration hoped would draw bipartisan 
support from Congress. Democratic con
gressional aides wistfully noted that 
more than 80 percent of Senate Repub
licans, including Majority Leader Rob
ert Dole of Kansas, voted for the last 
minimum-wage increase in 1989. That 
vote lifted the wage floor to its current 
$4.25 level from $3.35 over two years.
But in fact, the strenuous objections of 
Armey and others mean the Presidents 
plan hasnt much chance to become law.
Nonetheless, the proposal may still 
help Clinton differentiate his agenda 
from that of the Republicans and show 
him to be sympathetic toward workingclass Americans. The important thing 
to note is the Democrats are for increas
ing the minimum wage and Republicans 
are not, House Minority Leader Rich
ard Gephardt of Missouri said yester
day. In last weeks State of the Union 
address, Clinton said that by next year, 
the purchasing power of the minimum
wage will be at a 40-year low, and he 
challenged lawmakers to find a way to 
make the minimum wage a living wage.
At the request of Sen. Edward Kennedy 
(D - Mass.), who has his own proposal to 
raise the minimum wage by $1.50 over 
three years, the President didnt use the 
speech last week to lay out a detailed 
plan; that way, lawmakers on both sides 
of the aisle could first be consulted. How
ever, his lack of specificity left some 
advocates of a higher wage grumbling 
that Clinton wasnt serious about the 
initiative, which he had promised as a 
Presidential candidate.
Powerful business groups, including 
trade associations for restaurants and 
retailers, have already organized into a 
coalition to lobby against a higher mini
mum wage. Critics of an increase con
tend that the move would kill jobs, espe
cially for low-skilled adults.
For its part, the White House argues 
that academic research has shown that 
a 90-cent increase isnt a job destroyer 
and would have a positive effect on the
2.5 million Americans covered by the 
minimum wage. I believe the weight of 
the evidence is that a modest increase 
does not cost jobs and may even lure 
people back into the job market, Clinton 
said in last weeks speech.
Summit opens in the Middle East
CAIRO, February 2 (DJ)  Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, PLO chief 
Yasser Arafat, Jordans King Hussein 
and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt 
opened their summit today at an iftar, 
the traditional breaking of the day-long 
fast in the Muslim holy month of 
Ramadan.
Each of the three visitors met sepa
rately with Mubarak before the unprecedented four-way summit at the 
Ittahadiya presidential palace.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, 
when asked about what specific out
come the meeting would bring, said he 
expected the four partners to form a 
committee of foreign ministers to imple
ment decisions on economic problems 
and other issues coming out of todays 
summit. But he gave no hint on what 
those decisions would be.
Dole announces 1996 candidacy
WASHINGTON, February 3  On 
the David Letterman show Friday night, 
Bob Dole made an informal announce
ment of his bid for the Republican Presi
dential nomination. He said Ill make 
my, what you call a formal announce
ment in early April of this year. This was 
an informal announcement. Letterman
offered the senator a campaign button 
with Doles and his photos and the slo
gan Dole and Dumber. Dole quipped, 
I might say you were not my first choice.
Baseball owners erase salary cap
WASHINGTON, February 3Under 
pressure from both a federal agency and 
the White House, baseball owners have 
scrapped the salary cap which was im
posed in December, according to the 
Associated Press. The cap was a major 
stumbling block in the negotiations re
garding the strike, which has gone on for 
six months. Players had been stalling at 
the bargaining table, hoping the Na
tional Labor Relations Board would go 
to court and seek an injunction against 
the cap.
Clinton appoints Surgeon General
WASHINGTON, February 2 (DJ)  
President Clinton named Henry W. Fos
ter, of Nashville, Tennessee, as Surgeon 
General. Foster would succeed Joycelin 
Elders, who resigned late last year.
Foster, who was bomin Arkansas and 
who practices in the U.S., is an authority 
on family planning and Clinton said he 
was widely respected in the world of 
medicine and science.
Foster was immediately attacked by 
the conservative Family Research Coun
cil asbeingElders-Lite. Elders resigned 
her post late last year after a series of 
public remarks on sex education, legal
ization of drugs and other matters stirred 
controvery.
Family Research Council President 
Gary Bauer said, The new appointee, 
Foster, may not have [Elders] methods, 
but he has supported the same failed 
policies on contraceptive-based sex edu
cation.
Bauer said Foster had served as a 
board member of Planned Parenthood.
One of Fosters key roles will be to 
spearhead Clintons campaign against 
teenage pregnancy, which he announced 
in his State of the Union message last 
month.

Fire set in Morewood E Tower
By MAX CHITTISTER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
On February 1, there was a 
fire in the south stairwell of the 
sixth floor of Morewood Gar
dens E tower. Campus Police 
responded, as well as Pitts
burgh Police and Pittsburgh 
Fire units.
By the time Campus Police 
responded, a dry chemical fire 
extinguisher had been used on 
a pile of burning papers. The 
edges of the papers were par
tially-burnt.
Portions of the paper, & Pitts
burgh Post Gazette, were wet. The 
lower layers of the paper were 
completely soaked.
There was no flammable fluid 
present. The floor around the pa
per was dry and covered with 
chemical powder from the extin
guisher.
Several layers of paper were 
taken into evidence. Police took 
fingerprints from the fire extin
guisher. It is unknown who put 
the fire out.
Later that evening, an emer
gency floormeeting was called by 
John Hannon, head of Morewood 
Gardens, and Javed Jahangir, a
Masters student in public policy 
and management and resident 
assistant for E6. At the meet
ing, both asked if anyone knew 
cither who set the fire or who 
put it out.
"Apparently the fire extin
guisher was just there, said 
Jahangir.
At the meeting, Jahangir 
warned everyone of the seri
ousness of the situation. He 
said, Its not just a prank, its 
highly illegal.
The amount of damage is un
known, It is unclear who will 
pay for the damage.

Professor Allan Hammond of 
New York Law School spoke Fri
day afternoon at a lecture set up 
by the electronic bulletin board 
committee.
The lecture was the first in what 
will be a series of lectures dealing 
with the topic of censorship of 
bboards. The main point he ad
dressed in the lecture was What 
is a common carrier?
It is possible that CMU is ex
empt due to two clauses in the 
censorship laws. One states that 
libraries, colleges, universities, 
and schools are immune from cen
sorship, since they are institu
tions of education.
The other concerns common 
carriers. If CMU is considered a 
common carrier of electronic 
information, the University can 
not be held liable for the informa
tion transmitted, and therefore 
can not be censored.
In order to officially be consid
ered a common carrier, the 
University would need to sign 
the equivalent of a contract, ac
cording to Hammond, with the 
FCC.
Its not clear that they [CMU] 
are in violation of the law, 
Hammond stated. Is the com
munity compelled to delete these 
bboards? We dont know yet.
The state is compelled to stop 
the transmission of obscene 
material. One question is, Are 
the bboards obscene or merely 
indecent? This is a very subjec
tive question. Hammond pointed 
out, What passes muster in 
Philadelphia nay not pass mus
ter in Pittsburgh.
There is also the question of 
presentation. Text, on the whole, 
is more difficult to prove obscene 
than pictures are. Hammond used 
an example concerning books. If 
a bookstore has a closed book in 
its front window, and the book is 
obscene, it would not violate 
the law. However, if the same 
book is sitting wide open in the 
front window, this would be in 
violation of the law.
Hammond pointed out that the 
law is very clear that obscene 
materials may not be given to 
children under the age of 18. If 
there were no restrictions placed 
on the bboards, then the univer
sity would be in violation of the 
law.
However, if the university com
pletely shut out everyone under 
the age of 18 from the Internet, 
then it would be impeding the 
educational process.
The censorship situation on
campus began last November 
when administration blocked ac 
cess to 81 bboards which wer 
deemed offensive. The bboard 
were from the alt.sex 
rec.arts.erotica, and alt.binaries 
pictures.erotica groups.
Peter Ashcroft, GSO represen 
tative on the bulletin board com 
mittee, has written a draft of 
policy on electronic communica 
tions. The draft has not been ap 
proved by the bulletin board com 
mittee.
Concerning minors on the net 
the draft says In order to pre 
vent minors from accessing inap 
propriate material, accounts ere 
ated for high school and seconc 
ary school students will be sub 
ject to involuntary censorship 
The parent or guardian of an 
incoming student that is unde
18 is responsible for notifying th 
administration to request tha 
involuntary censorship be addec 
to the minors account.
The minor, upon coming of ag 
is responsible for notifying th 
administration of the desire 
have the involuntary censorshi 
removed. Absent specific guarc 
ian request, the University a 
smes that sending your min 
to the University implies a reac 
ness for said minor to be exposec 
to adult topics.

McCullagh was charged with simple as
sault but pled guilty to harressment.
Apparently, McCullagh asked Chris 
Newman, a mutual friend, to make con
tact with Riley. Basically, I know both 
Donna and Declan personally and Declan
wanted to either talk to Donna or hav 
his attorney talk to Donna before thi 
thing blows up any further. This ca 
was in violation of a court order filed o 
December 13, 1994. According to th 
police report, the order says tha 
McCullagh is not to have any contac 
with Riley, even through a third party 
Byron King, McCullaghs lawyer, saic 
On advice of counsel ... Declan had 
third party call up Donna Riley and as 
if there was any possibility of settlin 
the issues and the differences... withou 
going through the University Disciplin 
process or legal process downtown 
Donna ... declined to resolve it at 
person-to-person level. The call wa 
made as a good faith effort, accordin 
to King. Both McCullagh and Riley hac 
no comment.
Crime and Incident Report
1/27 MEDICAL ESCORT,
10:08 pm. An officer responded to 
a call from Hamerschlag House. 
A student had called CMU Police 
and said he was running a tem
perature of 104 and requested 
transport to the hospital. He was 
| transported to Presbyterian Hos
pital.
1/27 HARASSMENT, 2:28 pm. 
Officers were dispached to Cyert 
Hall, where a female had been 
molested. She said that while she 
was working on her computer a 
man entered her office. He was 
white, 30 years of age, sandy bown 
hair, 5'3", thin, wearing a gray or 
green jacket, brown pants, and 
wire rim glasses. He didnt say 
anything to the victim. He walked 
over to her and placed his hand 
on her shoulder, then stood and 
watched as she called campus 
police. After the call he left the 
area in an unknown direction. A 
check by Campus Police proved 
negative. A witness was not in 
j the room at the time of the inci
dent, but she did see the actor. 
The victim stated several times 
i that the person is crazy and on 
drugs. No further information 
could be obtained.
1/27 MUSIC COMPLAINT,
8:43 pm. An officer responded to 
! the Womens Center for a noise 
complaint. Residents of the area 
were being bombarded with noise 
as several bands were scheduled 
and played for a Pittsburgh Ac
tion Against Rape benefit. A stu
dent told police that the event 
had been set up by a CMU staff 
member, but that she was not in 
attendance. The officer found that
the music was excessive. The 
Womens Center was packed with 
people. The operations man at 
the rear of the room said the 
sound in his control was off, but 
the amplifiers were out of con
trol. The next band promised to 
keep the noise down, but CMU 
Police received another call com
plaining about the noise. An of
ficer responded and an agreement 
was made to end the event at 11 
pm. There are several events such 
as this planned for the rest of the 
semester. Residents of the area 
will not put up with the noise. 
Residence Life has been advised, 
and they will look into the situa
tion.
1/27 VEHICLE DAMAGE,
10:31 pm. An escort driver re
ported that he put his van in 
reverse and hit a car that was 
parked very close. The damage 
consisted of minimal scratches 
on the front bumper of the other 
car. The car belongs to a worker 
at the Carnegie Mellon Health 
Center. The escort van already 
had a large dent on the rear 
bumper. A note was left on the 
windshield to contact Campus 
Police if there were any concerns 
about the scratches.
1/28 PROPERTY DAMAGE,
11 am. While on a break from the 
IUP Police Academy, two cadets 
broke a 3 ft. by 8 ft. table sitting 
outside Wean 7500. The cadets 
were sitting on the table when it 
broke down the center. The value 
of the table is unknown.
1/28 MEDICAL, 6:22 pm. A 
complainant contacted Campus
Police and stated that her room
mate was experiencing severe 
abdominal pains which appeared 
suddenly. An officer responded to 
Fairfax Apartments to assess the 
situation. City Medics were noti
fied and responded along with 
CMU EMS. The victim was trans
ported to Presbyterian Hospital.
1/28 MEDICAL CALL, 6:58 
pm. The complainant said that 
her ears were quite painful. She 
stated that she had recently vis
ited Health Services, but her con
dition could not be treated by 
them. Her condition worsened, 
so she called Campus Police for 
transport to the hospital. She 
stated that she had a history of 
ear infections since the fourth 
grade when a blood vessel in her 
ear ruptured during an airplane 
flight. No first aid was adminis
tered.
1/28 SUSPECTED MARI
JUANA USE, 11:44 pm. Cam
pus Police received a report of 
suspected marijuana use in 
Mudge House. The complainant, 
who is also the resident assis
tant, spoke with a student whose 
room smelled of marijuana 
smoke. She advised him that 
smokingmarijuanais against the 
law and CMU policy. She later 
notified Residence Life of the com
plaint. Officers later went to 
speak with the student. When 
they opened the door, the officers 
could see that a cloth had been 
rolled up and placed in the crack 
between the door and the floor, 
and the window was open. The 
student was again warned and 
the officers explained CMU policy
to him. They told him that if they 
were called back on another com
plaint they would have to con
duct a search of the area. The 
student stated that he understood 
everything that was explained to 
him concerning such activity.
1/29 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 1:09 am. Officers re
sponded to a loud party in 
Roselawn. A female descended 
the stairs, high-fived another 
person, and threw a Miller Genu
ine Draft bottle onto the drive
way, breaking it. She was issued 
an internal citation for her ac
tions. The residents were warned 
about the loud noise and were 
told that, if there was another 
complaint, the party would be 
broken up. Several more noise 
complaints were recieved later in 
the evening. When police re
turned, there were still approxi
mately 25 people in attendance. 
An internal citation was issued 
to the residents. The party was 
shut down and all non-residents 
were made to leave. While pa
trons were disbursing, an indi
vidual was seen tampering with 
the outside drivers side mirror of 
the Campus Police car.
1/29 MEDICAL ESCORT,
1:24 am. An officer went to Donner 
Hall to transport a student to 
Presbyterian Hospital for treat
ment of a chin laceration he re
ceived while skiing at Seven 
Springs. While he was skiing, he

the ground, causing the injury. 
The Ski Patrol had advised him 
to see about getting stitches when 
he got back to campus, but no
first aid was administered.
1/29 MEDICAL CALL, 4:01 
pm. The victim was horseplaying 
with friends when he got hit in 
the nose with an elbow. His nose 
was visibly deformed from the 
injury. CMU EMS responded, and

of Clyde Street and Fifth Avenue, 
and when he saw the victim walk
ing up the street, he crossed Fifth 
and followed her until she en
tered Mudge House. The man en
tered the foyer of Mudge, but was 
unable to enter.
1/30 THEFT, 10:59 pm. An of
ficer was dispached to the Vend

Despite the extreme negativism 
prevalent on this campus, and 
the contrary actions taken by 
people who refuse to recycle, 
Carnegie Mellon is a leader in 
recycling: collecting more types of 
materials and in a larger percent
ages than most comparable uni
versities. Bins for recycling are 
scattered across the campus. They 
can be found inside the academic 
buildings, inside the dormitories, 
and outdoors on the campus 
grounds.
Regardless of the opinions of 
students, faculty, or staff, recy
cling on campus works and is be
coming more successful. For ex
ample, in 1990 when the recy
cling programs on campus began, 
three tons of aluminum cans were 
collected and recycled. In 1991 
that number was up to four tons. 
In 1992 it was five tons, and in
1993 it had jumped to ten and one 
half tons. Similar increases can 
be seen in the tons of recycled 
glass and paper.
In April 1994, Carnegie Mellon 
was recognized for its outstand
ing efforts in recycling when it 
was awarded a Three Rivers En
vironmental Award in the Busi
ness, Corporate category. This 
award recognizes and honors out
standing achievement in environ
mental initiatives in the Westem 
Pennsylvania region.
Student opinions seem to re
flect those of an ignorant popula
tion  cries of Theres no recy
cling here or there, or chants of 
You cant recycle anything, are
Newspapers in general are rela
tively predictable  theres the 
news section, the sports section, 
and the comics, usually along with 
living and entertainment sections. 
Often, there is very little opportu
nity to respond to what we see in 
print. At The Tartan, we find a lot 
of value in the exchange and in 
the frequent clash of ideas. The 
Forum pages are our way of fos
tering free exchange of ideas, so 
we try to provide a spectrum of 
opinions to allow you, our read
ers, to be the judges.
To that end, youll find the fol
lowing types of pieces in this sec
tion:
Editorials always appear in the 
leftmost columns of the first Fo
rum page. They are unsigned be
cause they represent a consensus 
opinion of The Tartans editorial 
board.
While we believe our editorials 
offer sensible, accurate commen
tary, please feel free to disagree 
with us  we dont have a mo
nopoly on the truth. As a matter 
of fact, we would love to know 
what you think of what we think. 
An excellent means to do this is to 
write a Letter to the Editor.
Letters to the Editor may be 
submitted by anybody, although 
when space gets tight we will fa
vor letters from members of the 
University community. As read
ers, you should realize that opin
ions represented in a letter are 
those of the author and not of The 
Tartan. All letters are subject to 
editing for size and grammar (letcompletely unfounded and just 
plain wrong. On campus, there 
are collection bins for paper, cans, 
glass, plastic, phone books, maga
zines, newspapers, and card
board. Sheet metal, leaves, and 
many other items not directly re
lated to student life are also re
cycled.
At the hub of student activities, 
housing, and many student orga
nization offices, is the Student 
Center. In this building alone, 
there are collection bins for cans, 
paper, and cardboard. Soon this 
list will also include glass and 
plastic. The receptacles for col
lecting recycables are located at 
the top and bottom of each stair
way, in front of the Security of
fice, in the student lounge, and in 
front of the CMAP office. Student 
organizations, however, are re
sponsible for emptying their of
fices into the central collection 
bins.
With all the efforts exerted by 
Carnegie Mellon to introduce and 
maintain a comprehensive recy
cling system, the campus commu
nity should be making an effort to 
utilize it (or at least stop com
plaining about it in ignorance).
So, the next time you find your
self holding an empty beverage 
bottle and theres not a recycling 
bin located directly below your 
hand, take the extra five or ten 
steps and drop it in the appropri
ate recycling bin. It takes no ef
fort on your part and can only 
help the campus community and 
the environment in the future.
ters should not exceed 500 words). 
But we never edit a letter for 
content.
Of course, we reserve the right 
to reject letters we feel are libel
ous, obscene, or incoherent. But 
well be glad to discuss any letter 
with the author and see if we can 
reach a compromise. However, in 
order to have such a discussion, 
we need to know who you are. We 
are willing to withhold the 
authors name from a Letter to 
the Editor, but our Editor-in-Chief 
does need to know who wrote it. 
Please, dont send us anonymous 
letters  it just frustrates us be
cause we have no way to contact 
you, and it annoys you because 
your letter doesnt get published.
Persons Opinion is just that  
the opinions of randomly polled 
persons, usually students at 
CMU, on a different question or 
concern each week. The people in 
Persons Opinion have no affilia
tion with The Tartan, and as such, 
their opinions are in no way re
lated to The Tartan.
Columns are consistently-ap
pearing opinion pieces presented 
by individuals who are usually 
members ofthe CMU community. 
We are looking to diversify the 
Forum section and encourage stu
dents, faculty and staff to write a 
column on something which in
terests them. Opinions in these 
columns are those of the colum
nist and not of The Tartan. Again, 
feel free to disagree with them 
and to let them know, through a 
Letter to the Editor.
Headline stories 
chosen unwisely
Editor:
I am disap
pointed with the 
journalistic integ
rity displayed by 
The Tartan in the 
coverage of Declan 
McCullagh over the last couple of weeks 
[1/23 and 1/30 articles and editorials]. It 
is obvious that the story and editorials 
have been written with a biased ap
proach. My complaint to The Tartan 
has to do with the choice of headline 
articles rather than how the stories 
were developed. Since I have been at 
CMU, there have been a number of 
fellow students who have passed away. 
Two more died in December and while 
the article made the front pagei it ap
parently was not as important as the 
article about charges brought against 
McCullagh since that was the headline 
article. Neither was a tuition hike for 
undergraduate education at CMU com
pared to alleged fiscal misconduct. I can 
understand USA Today and the other 
garbage magazines plastering the O. J. 
Simpson trial and political scandals over 
its front pages because they are trying 
to sell papers and magazines rather 
than report the critical events of the 
world. ButThe Tartan is free to stu
dents and, as such, it should not feel the 
pressure to revert to yellow journal
ism* to sell its free paper. CMU stu
dents are smart enough to know what 
the real news is. I am aware that domes
tic abuse and violence is a serious prob
lem in the world today, and naturally it 
should be professionally reported to help 
people understand its cause and effect. 
However, doesnt a greater problem ex
ist when students pour a couple fifths of 
hard liquor down their throats and die? 
This incident, as well as the other tragic 
deaths that have occurred over the last 
two years, should remind all of us how 
fragile a life can be even at our age and 
how important it is for us to appreciate 
the world around us. How about an 
article examining these lives and deaths 
and their effect on this campus?

Guilty plea does 
not mean guilty
Editor:
I read your 1/30 
editorial calling for 
Declan McCullaghs 
resignation, and I 
have a few questions 
for your editorial board. Is it ever pos
sible that someone could plead guilty to 
a crime they didnt commit? In our court 
system, the answer is yes. I personally 
have a friend who was advised to plead 
guilty to reckless driving in an acci
dent clearly caused by a police officer, 
because other wise much more serious 
changes would have been filed against 
him, which would have cost a lot of 
money to defend against). I can easily 
believe that in todays political climate, 
it is much wiser to plead guilty to minor
harassment charges than to defend your
self against assault charges by someone 
out to destroy you at all costs. McCullagh 
probably saved himself thousands of 
dollars in legal bills by his guilty plea, in 
addition to a possible felony conviction 
and permanent blacklisting by grad 
schools and employers. Isnt it a strange 
coincidence that at the same time he is 
accused of sexual harassment, supposed 
financial improprieties are also sud
denly discovered? Did it occur to any
one that this alleged theft might just be 
an attempt by those who want him out 
to strengthen their case? Why is it that 
his claims of being legally unable to 
answer the harassment charges pub
licly in The Tartan are taken as evi
dence of guilt? Has it ever occurred to 
you that he might be worried that a 
public misquoting in a paper obviously 
predisposed against him might damage 
his case? Or that he might actually have 
been ordered to remain silent by the 
disciplinary bodies involved, or by his 
lawyer? Personally, I dont have too 
much sympathy for McCullagh, since 
by his past involvement in the Womens 
Center he has helped create the politi
cal climate for his own lynching. But 
lets at least wait until all the facts are 
out before judging him. The Tartan 
should be ashamed of itself for calling 
for an impeachment based on partial 
and one-sided information.

Writer wrongly 
attacks religion
Editor:
When I was con
sidering pursuing 
graduate studies 
at CMU, a friend 
warned me that I 
would find an environment hostile to 
faith: as she succinctly put it, Intellect 
is their god. My experience here has 
confirmed my friends analysis; indeed, 
a glance at the opinion page of The 
Tartan revels that Intellect is a jealous 
god, intolerant of infidels and heretics. 
I have been amused by Matt Balls in
cessant preaching of his gospel of veg
etarianism and occasionally irritated 
by his sniping against religion, but until 
now I have regarded his tirades as too 
inane to merit a reply.
However, with his recent slur against 
Pope John Paul II  via the simplistic 
rhetorical device of linking his name to 
those of unsavory historical figures  
Ball has exposed the spiteful spirit and 
narrow mind that shape his world view. 
One can only speculate as to why Ball 
chose to vilify John Paul, a man of great 
intellect and compassion, who has 
thought deeply and written lucidly about 
mankinds place in the universe and 
about relations among differing faiths. 
Perhaps it is because a bigot simply 
cannot bear the existence of anyone 
who does not fit his stereotypical no
tions about how categories of people 
behave. An anti-religious zealot can 
more easily tolerate a crass TV evange
list than a dignified spirtual leader, 
because the former reinforces negative 
preconceptions about Christianity,
while the latter contradicts those pre
conceptions. Jimmy Swaggert is no 
threat and and can be ignored, but John 
Paul is dangerous and must be discred
ited. The most disturbing words in all of 
Balls columns are those that appear at 
the end: Matt Ball is a Ph.D candidate 
in Engineering and Public Policy. The 
implications of a man so hateful and 
intolerant becoming involved in the craft
ing of public policy are frightening. 
Carnegie Mellon University is doing our 
nation a great disservice if it fails to 
imbue in our future policy-makers some 
measure of understanding and respect 
for belief systems other than their own.

Person's opinion 
lacks diversity
Editor:
Im a regular 
reader of The Tar
tan, and one section 
that I always skim 
over is A Persons 
Opinion. For nearly three years, Ive 
noticed discrepancies over who is se
lected (e.g. three out of the four people 
are all freshman). This has never really 
bothered me that much. But in response 
to the question in the January 23 edi
tion of The Tartan, What did you think 
about having classes on Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day? I was truly shocked and 
disturbed to see that the majority of 
respondents were all Caucasian. Mar
tin Luther King Jr. was a man who 
wanted all people, regardless of their 
color, race or cultural background, to 
unite and erase discrimination in 
America. Therefore, I was disappointed 
that the Persons Opinion respondents 
were almost homogenous. In that same 
issue of The Tartan, many articles were 
written, attacking the Universitys, 
choice to not celebrate Kings birthday; 
as a disregard to diversity. And yet, byselecting a group of people with very; 
little cultural differences, The Tartan; 
was also disregarding the diversity of; 
responses they could have had. If theresponses by the students had more! 
merit, I probably would not be writing! 
in regards to them. But two of the four, 
students blatantly showed ignorance of* 
this very important day. As one student; 
put it, It didnt really matter to me...; 
As mentioned before, the Persons Opin-; 
ion section has had little diversity in; 
whom they choose. A former member ofj 
The Tartan staff pointed out to me thatj 
sometimes only half an hour is given to! 
solicit responses and pictures for this 
section. Therefore, I can understand 
why it may be hard to always receive a* 
diverse pool of respondents. But I feel ifj 
The Tartan really wants a bigger pic-; 
ture of what students opinions are, then' 
they should make more of an effort toj 
ask people of different backgrounds,; 
years and majors. I hope The Tartani 
can at least keep this in mind for future* 
reference in order to serve their diverse 
readership better.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  6 February 19955
Technological advances dont mean progress
The Editors Notebook
The Editors Notebook presents the in
dividual opinion of the author only, not 
necessarily the opinions of The Tartan or 
of the Editorial Board.
Many assert that American progress 
niay be measured through advance
ments in medicine, equal rights and 
access legislation, and quality of life 
worldwide.
They say that there is a continuous 
stream of women and minorities enter
ing the work force, people are living 
longer than ever before, and soon we 
will be able to stay at home rather than 
go to school.
These groups claim that all of these 
factors indicate that tolerance, generos
ity, and equity are on the upswing in 
America, that things can only get better 
from here. I disagree.
While it is true that more women are 
working than ever before, this is mainly 
because they have to. There is an un
precedented number of single mothers 
in this country than ever before, and 
they must feed their children.
Additionally, although most women 
work, they occupy positions that pay 
substantially less than their male coun
terparts (a trend which has not been 
reversed, in spite of the commonly ac
cepted notions of advancement in the 
equal treatment of women).
Although minorities have been allowed 
to partake in a piece of the American 
Pie, it is a very small piece. The powers 
that be have dictated how small this 
piece, this opportunity, will be.
They leave Hispanics, blacks, and other 
minorities to bicker among themselves, 
to decide how much of the very little each 
group will receive. They encourage us to 
confuse the freedom to determine our 
own destinies with the freedom to deter
mine how our destinies will support and
Efficiency is the measure of value and 
technology is the tool that we use to 
achieve this efficiency. The value of 
technology in American culture is nei
ther inherent, nor permanent
perpetuate the dominant cultures.
Do not get me wrong, I am discussing 
institutionalized, covert patterns that 
powerful peoples and organizations en
gage in daily, I am not asserting that 
there is a conspiracy headed by overtly 
hateful groups in. America. If the latter 
were true, it would be very easy to disarm 
the far-reaching influence of inequality 
that forms the base of our society.
However, since this injustice is not readily 
identifiable, it is very difficult to destroy 
and change it. Many will rightly claim that 
there are important functions of improved 
medicinesuch as cures for various dis
eases.
Although it is true that we now possess 
the means to cure many illnesses that were 
fatal before, we must remember that many 
of the epidemics that our culture faces were 
not present in other societies, because they 
were not so focused on technological supe
riority.
For instance, doctors are now able to save 
many victims of gunshot wounds. This is a 
good thing in a society which has the most
_________________ deaths from
gunshots in the 
history of the 
world. How
ever, these me
dicinal tools 
would not be so 
valued in a so
ciety which did 
not have guns.
__________________ In this way,
II our violence 
and insistence 
upon polluting the earth cause us to de
velop more and more complex means of 
maintaining our existence. We term this 
process progress.
The notion that the quality of life world
wide improves as technology advances is 
also faulty. In the Western Hemisphere 
(which is now overtaking the East, the 
North, etc., through the advertising indus
try), we have this absurd notion that the
faster things are, the better they are.
Efficiency is the measure of value, and 
technology is the tool that we use to achieve 
this efficiency. The value of technology in 
American culture is neither inherent, nor 
permanent.
The value that we give it may be seen as 
the effect of what we value in our culture, 
which is fairly arbitrary, as different cul
tures value different things. Why is effi
ciency valued so highly in our society? 
That is another question altogether, and 
one which this column does not claim to 
answer.
From the content of my assertions, and 
from the fact that I attend school at a 
school which prides itself on its techno
logical superiority, and the value of this in 
Americans daily lives, you must be ask
ing yourself if I am for real.
How can I claim that technology is so 
bad, so wrong, since I use it on a daily 
basis? How can I state that the world 
needs to be free when I am not free myself?
My response is that no one is truly free, 
no one can escape their reality, their cul
ture.

Personal revolution must come before

News Flash: CMU tuition goes 
up again this year.
Okay, so its not a news flash. 
Its just about what you expect. 
They tell you that its the small
est increase in years and that 
much of it is for financial aid. 
Still, shelling out $18,000 for a 
year of school is a pretty penny 
and we may want to consider 
some of the problems.
CMU has been increasing tu
ition annually since Ive been 
here. This is no big deal. The big 
deal is that tuition has increased 
almost 50 percent in that time 
period (Okay, so Ive been here a 
LONG time).
Gee, I dont recall Big Macs 
going up that much. I certainly 
know that starting salaries 
havent jumped up 50 percent 
either. Its quaint that they keep 
telling you its only increasing by 
a small percent.
Well, as you continue to add to 
base value, constant incremen
tal increases become lesser per
centage increases as the princi
pal grows. So if you keep adding 
$500 per year to tuition, eventu
ally it will be a small percentage. 
Of course by then tuition is going
to be a mighty large number so 
that $500 becomes merely a small 
percentage.
Of course, theres also the ex
cuse that the increases are largely 
there for the sake of financial 
aid. This could be more honestly 
stated that as taking money from 
most to give to a few.
Now, donations and charity are 
all well and good, but hiding it 
behind a price increase is not
really fair. Many -------------------
families are 
straining to 
send their kids 
here without fi
nancial aid, and 
the steady in
creases dump 
the burden in 
their lap.
Also, the fi....................
nancial aid
tends to be need-based, so what 
the process is really doing here is 
weeding out the middle class. The 
people who have money can af
ford it, and the people who dont 
get subsidized.
The people in the middle get 
squeezed out, or they go into a 
large amount of debt. Financial 
aid should not be a portion of 
tuition. What ends up happening 
is that some people get forced by 
the tuition increases into need
ing financial aid to pay for an 
increase due to the aid. This is 
simply stupid.
Of course, the financial aid also 
empowers the University at the
expense of the students. Who 
decides who gets aid? The ad
ministratorsdo.
These are also the people who 
continue to increase tuition so 
that aid becomes necessary to 
more and more people. This gives 
them the power to promote what
ever agenda tickles their fancy.
The current diversity agenda 
is quite effectively helped along 
by the University being able to
freshmen large financial aid 
grants, and then lessen the 
bounty come sophomore year. To 
think, people actually wonder 
why CMU does not retain a large 
portion of its freshmen.
I know quite a few people who 
chose this school on the basis of 
the generous financial aid, only 
to have the grant slashed to rib
bons. This has had two primary 
responses in people. The first is

the middle class.
pick and choose among people of 
normal financial means. Which
ever group is in vogue for aid at 
the time can get their extra help
ing of financial assistance.
Of course, this power could also 
be used for more insidious means 
(not that the diversity agenda 
isnt bad enough). What if some
one complains enough about Uni
versity policies to be a thorn in 
their side? A note saying Sorry, 
you dont qualify for as much 
financial aid this year, and zip! 
Theyre gone. And now for the 
last, we have the Carnegie 
Mellon Hook. This is the tradi
tional CMU tendency to offer
to bail out. I have lost a number 
of good friends. The other is loans. 
Casting yourself into deep debt 
to get through college is a stan
dard option, but certainly not a
good one.
Now, of course all Ive done is 
hammer the notion of financial 
aid provided by the University. 
Youre going to say, But what 
about the people who can only 
afford to come here because of 
it?
Well there are two options. 
One, dont come here. Two, have 
financial aid provided by another 
source not associated with the 
University. Im rather fond of 
the second suggestion since edu
cating the intelligent should not 
be neglected due to a lack of 
means, but the current unsatis
factory implementation. At least 
the second option will both allow 
charity to be noted as what it is - 
a good deed, not a cost, and it will 
serve to remove power from Uni
versity administrators.

dent in MSE who surprisingly 
wasnt hosed by the financial aid 
office, but then again, he didnt 
get any.

Womens b-ball breaks losing streak
Andrew McDermott/Tartan Photo Staff 
. Sophomore Kelly Gaitens controlls the ball for the 
Tartans in Fridays tough loss to NYU.
By STEVEN BURNS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
womens basketball team came 
back strong on Sunday with a 
victory at home against 
Brandeis University. This vic
tory came close on the heels of 
a hard-fought loss to topranked New York University.
In the 64-51 Tartan win 
against Brandeis, sophomore 
Kristin Kupfer led scoring with
19 points. Sophomore Rebecca 
McCadney and sophomore 
Kelly Gaitens were also ex
tremely strong with 14 points 
apiece. Gaitens was impres
sive from the 3-point line, sinkingthree of her eight attempts.
The women were powerful 
in both offensive and defen
sive rebounds, with Kupfer and
McCadney again leading the statistics 
with 11 and eight rebounds, respectively.
Head coach Gerri Seidl was extremely 
pleased with her teams performance. 
We executed our game plan; we did 
what we wanted to do, she said. We 
played nice as a team. It was nice... very 
nice to win today.
The womens team took a tough defeat 
by the score of 64-51 on Friday night at 
the hands of New York University. New 
York came into the game ranked num
ber one in their region, but the Tartans 
werent intimidated as they played a 
very tough game.
New York jumped out to an early lead, 
but, for the first seven minutes, the 
Tartans kept it close at 10-8. Then New 
York opened it up and used their driving 
and passing ability to sprint ahead to a 
30-19 half time lead.
The second half started out with the 
same type of play that ended the first 
half. New York extended their lead to
3822, but then the Tartans got a spark 
as Kupfer drove to the hoop, sank her 
shot, and was fouled. Her converted free 
throw brought the Tartans to 38-25.
The Tartans then brought the play 
inside and put two New York starters 
into foul trouble. A breakaway lay-up by 
freshman Jessica Connolly and inside 
buckets by freshman Katie OLeary and 
McCadney gave the Tartans more room 
outside of the paint. This opened up 
Gaitens and Kupfer who nailed shots 
from behind the three point arc.
The Tartans brought the score to 52- 
44 and appeared to be on their way to an 
incredible comeback, but New York 
stepped it up when they had to. In the 
next two minutes, they went on a 7-0 
run. The Tartans responded with a 6-0 
run of their own to bring the score to 59-
50 with four minutes left.
New York kept the Tartans from scor
ing another field goal for the rest of the 
game and iced the win at the foul line.
They were led by Marsha Harris with 19 
points.
The Tartans were hurt by the loss of 
sophomore Penny Summerville, who sat 
out the game with a foot injury. Kupfer 
led the Tartans in scoring with 17 while 
OLeary and McCadney added 11 and 10 
points respectively. Connolly and 
McCadney each grabbed seven rebounds 
for the Tartans.
Jessica is really coming on, said head 
coach Gerri Seidl. She is so much better 
now than at the beginning of the year.
Carnegie Mellon is now 2-8 in UAA 
play and 7-13 overall.They have four 
conference and one non-conference game 
remainingin the season.
The Tartans will hit the road this 
week for two more UAA matchups. They 
will try to avenge two earlier conference 
losses.
On Friday they visit Washington Uni
versity and then travel to the University 
of Chicago on Sunday.Tartans reach .500 in UAA competition

Two weeks ago, the Tartans 
traveled to Brandeis University 
and New York University, losing 
both games and severely damag
ing their standing in the UAA. 
This weekend, the Tartans hosted 
both teams in league rematches 
and forced both to depart from 
Pittsburgh with painful memories of plaid. On Friday, CMU 
took on the Violets of NYU and 
held on to win 74-70. Yesterday, 
in a game that saw contributions 
from many Tartans, CMU rode 
the wave of hot-shooting supersoph Rich Bodnar and defeated 
the Judges of Brandeis 86-78.
CMUs own version of the Wild 
Thing, guard Rich Bodnar, fired 
on all cylinders yesterday with a 
game-high 32 points as the Tar
tans completed the weekend 
sweep of UAA opponents. In what 
seemed to be a one-on-one 
shootout with Brandeis guard 
Chris Schneider, Bodnar finished 
with one more point and one more 
3-pointer than the Brandeis se
nior, paving the way for the Tar
tan victory. Bodnar finished the 
game with five baskets from be; yond the arc.
! Another key to the success of
the Tartans was the superb play 
of the bench. Coach Tony Wingen 
utilized 11 players, all at crucial 
times, in yesterdays victory. 
Sophomores Gary Trendel and 
Kevin Cackovic came in late in 
the second half when the game 
was still in question and contrib
uted, Cackovic with a lay-up and 
Trendel with a block. Juniors 
Steve Hartman and Gregg Lassan 
also played key roles as they have 
all season, as did freshmen 
LaDale Widmeyer and Andy

Sofish.
Meshingthe different mixes put 
together by Wingen has been the 
on the floor, captain Steve 
Athenas, whose emotional spark 
has prompted a new intensity on 
defense of late.
Were playing a lot harder, 
remarked the senior. Were com
ing to play every game and were 
a lot better on defense because of 
our intensity and togetherness.
Kevin Byrne contributed 10 in 
the victory over the Judges while 
Sofish chipped in 
11. Lassan had 
nine and Jon 
Blanciak added 
five points. 
Athenas had 13 
points with three 
3-pointers, all 
seemingly at cru
cial times.
He has done 
everything we 
have asked of 
him, Wingen 
commented on 
his senior. Its a 
joy to see him 
doing so well. He 
paid his dues 
coming up 
through the 
ranks and now

ball in his 
hands.

: The Carnegie Mellon Hockey Club spent the 
; weekend posting two more wins, one against divi; sion opponent Slippery Rock University and anj other in an exhibition game versus the Pittsburgh 
j Stars.
| Saturday evening, a shorthanded Carnegie 
| Mellon team beat the Pittsburgh Stars 7-6 in a 
non-league game. Many key players were missing, 
including the top scorer, junior Roger Maddalena, 
the Force of Nature, sophomore Ray Ardire, and 
star senior defenseman P. J. Mann.
As one might expect with the shortened bench, 
CMU played sloppily at the start of the game. The 
Stars didnt look all that terrific either, but they 
opened the scoring three and a half minutes into 
the game with a power play goal.
The Tartans went in the hole 2-0 about two 
minutes later. CMU cut the lead to 2-1 with about 
nine minutes remaining on a goal scored by senior 
| John Cardillo, assisted by junior Sean Odell and 
graduate student Tom Sullivan. A minute and a 
; half later, sophomore Jim Buck scored an unas
sisted shorthanded goal to tie the game at two.
This did not last long, though. With 6:41 remainnig, the Stars regained the lead 3-2 on a power play 
goal to close the first period scoring.
Jim Buck tallied the first score of the second 
Period three minutes in to tie the game at three 
with another unassisted goal. Three minutes later, 
the Stars once again took the lead when the puck 
bounced off a defenders skate past sophomore 
goaltender Jon Kliegman.
But CMU kept grinding and re-tied the game 
with 8:07 remainingin the second, on a goal scored 
by Buck, assisted by freshman Scott Fitzgerald. 
The Stars, however, took the lead for the fourth 
time to make it 5-4 at the end of two.
Less than one minute into the third, Cardillo tied 
it up on CMLPs first shot of the period for an 
unassisted goal. Six and a half minutes later, Buck
added his fourth of the night, assisted by senior 
defenseman Blair Echols and sophomore 
defenseman Chris Adukaitis. This made it 6-5 
Carnegie Mellon, its first lead of the night.
With 3:10 remaining, it was the Stars turn to tie 
the game as they added their sixth goal of the 
night. CMU regained their lead with 2:18 remain
ing on a nice second-chance shot by senior Dan 
Kodesh, assisted by Buck, his fifth point on the 
night. With 31 seconds remaining, the Stars called 
a timeout and pulled their goalie.
When play resumed, the Tartans controlled the 
puck and appeared to be winding the clock down to 
a win. However, those who chanced to glance at the 
clock noticed it still read 31 seconds!
The timekeeper finally restarted the clock after 
being admonished by the fans and the CMU bench, 
but this gave the Stars an additional ten to fifteen 
seconds to work with.
The Stars almost tied it up on a solid shot as time 
expired, but Kliegman handled it well to end the 
game.
Friday night, CMU defeated the Rockets of Slip
pery Rock by a score of 52 in a key divisional 
matchup. Last semester when these two teams 
met, they came away with a tie, 4-4. However, 
CMU was missing several key players at that time, 
and they felt confident going into this game.
Unfortunately, the game did not get off to a good 
start. Almost the entire CMU team appeared flat 
at the beginning of the first period, and a giveaway 
in the defensive zone led to SRUs first goal on the 
first shot of the game after just 31 seconds had 
ticked off the clock.
As the period progressed, CMU began to look 
stronger, and they were soon getting the better of 
the offensive chances. SRUs goaltender played a 
strong first period though, stopping 14 ofl 5 Tartan 
shots. The only one that slipped by was a goal by 
Cardillo, assisted by Mann and Buck, with 2:14 
remaining in the period.
CMU started the second period the same way 
they finished the first  strong. They took a 2-1
lead less than a minute and a half into the period. 
All three of CMLPs forwards were scrapping 
around the net, and Ardire managed to send the 
puck home, assisted by Kodesh and senior Phil 
Beck.
In general, the-second period was character
ized by more penalties and fewer offensive chances 
than the first. Not much seemed to be happening 
for either team until, when with about three and 
a half minutes remained, Cardillo received a 
beautiful pass from Maddalena on a 2-on-l and 
took a nice, hard shot at the net. However, SRUs 
goalkeeper wasnt fazed by this offensive dis
play, and denied the goal.
With 1:50 remaining, CMU did advance their 
lead to 31 on Ardires second goal of the game, 
once again assisted by Beck and Kodesh.
At the start of the third period, CMU once 
again looked a little sloppy offensively, but they 
played well defensively  Slippery Rock was 
unable to register their first shot of the period 
until more than nine minutes had expired.
However, they scored less than a minute later 
as a SRU player batted the puck into the net with 
his stick about waist high.
CMU was not to be outdone. With about six and 
a half minutes remaining in the game, Buck sent 
a beautiful pass to Maddalena at their blueline. 
Maddalena skated hard past three SRU defend
ers and sent the puck into the net on the short 
side from about five feet out..
Ardire finished off the scoring, and his hat 
trick, with an empty net goal with 30 seconds 
remaining in the game.
With the win over Slippery Rock, Carnegie 
Mellon lifted its division-leading record to
6-1-1.
They play a makeup game against the Commu
nity College of Allegheny County Tuesday night 
at 11:30 pm and then a non-league game against 
WVUs second team Friday night at 10:30 pm. 
Both games will be at Golden Mile Ice Arena in 
Monroeville.

Penalties entertain hockey fanatics
Now HonestLy!
by Eric Applewhite & Corey Zinn
Now, HonestLy! is a weekly column 
where Eric and Corey discuss, and ar
gue, their views on topics in the NHL. 
This week, they discuss the penalty sys
tem and talk about their favorite penal
ties.
Caps game, Craig Berube got a minor 
penalty for attempting to spear! Id like 
to know how the referee knew what Berube 
was attempting to do! Not that I wasnt 
happy, being a Pens fan and all, but I 
digress. Now on to a reaZ penaltyhead
butting!! This is when a player purposely 
rams his head into an opponent. And it 
carries with it the hefty price of being a 
major penalty; that is, five minutes in that 
wonderful penalty box!
Eric: Head-butting, cha, cha, cha! But 
Ive got an even better one: the cross 
check! WHAM! I just like the way it 
sounds. A cross check is defined in the 
official Applewhite dictionary as a check 
in which a player, holding his stick paral(hence the name!), the referee is at his 
discretion to call a minor or major penalty. 
Some people might think that this penalty 
is a little strange because hockey, by na
ture, is rough. But it is needed to keep the 
game under control. This usually works in 
the NHL, but in the minor leagues its a 
battle royale!
Eric: Boarding: Its either staying the 
night at someones house OR crunching 
anyone in a different colored jersey than 
yours into the boards. Its especially bad if 
you do this to a guy wearing black and 
white stripesif youve had this problem, 
maybe its time to hang up your skates for 
a while (probable ten game suspension!).
Corey: This week, Eric 
and I decided to discuss some 
of the penalties in hockey  
from the obvious to the ab
surd. Why dont you start, 
Eric?
Eric: Hmmmm... Spearing 
or butt-ending? Thats the 
question. A spear is any attempt to poke or prod an op
ponent with the point of the stick blade. 
This is not generally a good idea, on or 
off the ice. Butt-ending, on the other 
hand, is still a social faux-pas, but in
volves using the shaft end of your stick 
to send a friendly greeting. Both will 
send you to the penalty box of life. OK, 
your turn, Zinn!
Corey: Spearing, spearing. That re
minds me ... last Sunday, in the Pens/
... the cross check! WHAM! I just like the way it sounds. 
A cross check is defined... as a check in which a player ... 
delivers a blow of bone-crunching and epic proportions. An 
intimidating cross check rocks my world, but it makes the 
referee think you're a bad person.

Eric: Lets wrap up with fighting.
Corey: You wanna go, man?! Rig] 
here, right now!
Eric: No, not us! I dont fight with 
Pens fans. Theyre just not a challenge. 
Fightings bad!! I dont want to glorify 
violence, but it does add a bit of pep (0 
the game. Actually, most fights in the 
NHL involve two sweaty men clutching 
and grabbing each other, and gruntinga 
lotsomething that seems kind of anti, 
climactic. Still, I dont advocate getting 
rid of fighting like some. Its a serious 
penalty in hockey, but also part of the 
game. All things considered, 
Id rather see a cross check! 
Yee-hah!
lei to the ice in both hands, delivers a blow 
of bone-crunching and epic proportions. 
An intimidating cross check rocks my 
world, but it makes the referee think youre 
a bad person. Then he sends you to the box 
to think about the error of your ways.
Corey: Then theres the good, ole rough
ing call. It is very versatile, as far as 
penalties go. Basically, whenever a player 
gets a little too rough with an opponent
Corey: Some people might think inter
ference is the static you sometimes hear 
on the radio or when talking on a cordless 
phone, but in hockey its when you impede 
the progress of an opponent who is not in 
possession of the puck. Quite often, that 
player is the goalie.
Since the goaltender is sacred in hockey, 
such a penalty sometimes leads to scuffles 
and some short-term vacations for mul

Administrator spends weekends on gridiron
By ANGELA MOLLOY
Tartan Personnel Manager
Sanford Rivers is the Assis
tant Vice President for Enroll
ment but he has this sort of 
double life. You may have had 
problems getting an appoint
ment on Mondays last Fall since 
he might have been out on the 
gridiron, wearing the infamous 
black and white stripes, and of
ficiating an NFL game on na
tional television.
Football has played a key role 
throughout Rivers academic ca
reer. Rivers played football in 
college at Youngstown State and 
then made an unsuccessful run 
at turning professional. He 
ended up pursuinga Masters 
degree at the University of Pitts
burgh. Later, when he was at 
CMU, he played intramural foot
ball on the Pepper and Salt team. 
Back then, you had to referee 
another game when you played 
IM football. This is how Rivers 
was discovered.
Earl Birdy, who retired last 
year as the director of IM sports, 
apparently caught my act, said 
Rivers. Birdy asked if he had 
ever considered officiating foot
ball. Rivers replied with a quick 
no because he had the concep
tion that all football officials 
were not normal human beings. 
He said that being a player made 
you feel that the official did not 
understand the players men
tality.
However, Rivers ended up tak
ing a written exam that would 
certify him to referee in the Penn
sylvania Inter scholastic Athletic 
Association. By passing the 
exam and sending in the incred
ibly low-priced* registration of 
$20, Rivers was certified to be
gin officiating. And so in the fall 
of 1972, Rivers was assigned to 
ref a midget football game at a 
Catholic school in Mt. Lebanon 
where the teams were made up 
of mostly sixth and seventh grad
ers.
As for his first official experi
ence, Rivers said, If I could have 
killed a couple of the parents, it 
would have been fine. Rivers 
went on and up to officiate jun
ior high school games, high 
school games, then small col
leges, and finally made it to the 
Big East Conference in 1984. 
There, he officiated games be
tween schools like Penn State, 
Pitt, Notre Dame, Boston Col
lege, West Virginia, and Syra
cuse. Rivers was able to grow 
with the players that he would
help regulate and said, as age 
levels got older, my officiating 
experience progressed.
Between 1984 and 1989, Riv
ers worked in the Peach and Lib
erty Bowls as well as two ArmyNavy games. He said that travel
ing to all these different schools 
was fun ... coming from a colle
giate environment, you are able 
to compare the schools.
Rivers move to the big time 
NFL would take awhile. While he 
was enjoying the Big 
East, he submitted 
an application to the 
National Football 
League at Bird/s in
sistence. Over the 
years, the NFL would 
ask Rivers to send 
them his officiating 
schedule but they 
never contacted him. 
Eventually, Rivers 
was told that there 
were scouts out in the 
stands to start evalu
ating officials. Rivers 
had waiteduntil 1988 
and decided that this 
was too long, so didnt 
send in his schedule.
The NFL took no
tice, and sent Rivers 
a letter asking him to 
please submit one. In 
early 1989, he re
ceived a call from the 
officiating depart
ment telling him he 
was one of the final
ists for the NFL 
spots. Twenty other 
applicants were in 
the running as well 
and Rivers was told 
his chances were one 
in five.
The NFL did an 
extensive back
ground search and 
psychological testing.
The four-hour ses
sion included the psy
chologist asking one 
question, then asking it again 
about a half hour later, but phras
ing it differently to see if the 
response is consistent. Rivers had 
learned this game in classes in 
his Masters program and let the 
psychologist know, I can play 
this damn game as long as you 
can.
The extensive testing is done to 
analyze the persons character. 
When you are out on the field, in 
many cases, people will try to 
pick you for information, he said. 
It was in early March that phone 
call came. When it arrived, the
whole Admissions staff was wait
ing at his door to hear the good 
news. Rivers said after getting 
the call it was really, the Admis
sions office getting accepted to
referee in the AFC playoff game 
between Cleveland and New En
gland, a $10,000 bonus.

their own spring training just

Rivers works with doctors, law
yers, teachers, professors, bank
ers, and retired people from all 
parts of the country. There are 15

with four swing officials who are

next game and they know you. 
He said it also sets up an 
adversarial role with the
coaches.
Over the years, Rivers has spent 
time with the Jets, the Giants, 
the Eagles, the Chiefs, the 
Redskins, and the Patriots. I did 
have to ask him his favorite expe
rience and he said, no one doesil 
better than New York, and he 
meant the Giants. He described 
all the players he has spent time 
with as nice guys, whos emo
tions just take hold.
Rivers said, you cannot 
football unless youre an emo
tional person. He said the game 
is so competitive and the player: 
and the coaches have that onebi? 
goal to get to the Superbowl.
Rivers waited until the last sec
ond to mention that officiating 
can also be physically dangerous 
if you happen to be standing 
around while a few pro ball play
ers begin to charge you. Hes seen 
broken legs, collarbones, and 
punctured lungs.
During a New England game, 
Rivers slipped and fell and a 
was nice enough to share his beer 
with Rivers by pouring it on his 
head. To avoid any excess bodily 
harm, all officials are escorted on 
and off the field by security.
During all the split-seconc 
emotions during a game, you cani 
always be right. The whole ides 
is based on a split-second atti
tude where you need, as Rivers 
describes it, a keen sense of con
centration. During a Redskins 
versus Cardinals game where 
Rivers was officiating, there was 
a play to the sidelines. Rivers 
thought the player would go out 
of bounds and began to blow hi-! 
whistle. As it turned out the 
player did not go out of bounds 
and ended up making a 60 yard 
touchdown.
Well, the whistle kills all. The 
ball had to come back and the 
touchdown was not scored. Rfr 
ers said, the only thing that save, 
me is they [the team that hadjusl 
scored] were winning ... that1-1 
the most vivid thing to me, whe& 
I screwed up.
Rivers doesnt let this interfere 
with his University job. Mos1 
games are on Sunday and as to 
said, this does not require that 
miss a lot of time at the Univer 
sity. He is usually back Sundaj 
night unless there is a West Coa? 
game, in which case, he hops # 
the red-eye, takes Monday as 
vacation day, and arrives o! 
Tuesday. So next time you tutf 
on an NFL game, be on the loot 
out for Rivers. If hes not 
Warner Hall, you might see hie 
on the 50-yard line.

Swimming preps for UAA Championships

By DAVID OSORIO

Carnegie Mellons men and 
womens swim teams visited 
local colleges Allegheny and 
Washington Jefferson the 
weekend of January 27-28. It 
was the final opportu
nity for the team to fine ____
tune for the upcoming 
UAA championship
The mens swimming 
team beat Allegheny 
and Washington & 
Jefferson decisively. 
Allegheny college, a 
long time rival, ranked 
in the top ten teams in
the NCAA champion____
ships last year. m&m
The meet against Al
legheny marked how well the 
men and womens swim team 
would fare against the chal
lenging competition they would
meet in the UAA championships.
CMITs team went in with the goal of 
beating Allegheny without a diving team. 
Since CMU has no diving team, they 
went into the competition with a 16 
point disadvantage.
The mens team surpassed even coach 
Jim Cutrones expectations.
Stellar performances came from a

and the 200-meter breast stroke (2:16).
Freshman Jake McGuire who won the

The smaller womens team was not 
able to win at Allegheny or Washington
& Jefferson, but they still expressed
strong hopes and enthusiasm as the 
UAA championships come nearer.
Junior Paige Angstadt said, we hope 
we can pass last years ranking in the 
UAA tournament. Were excited about it 
and we feel we are well trained. 
Cutrone expects that the mens team 
will rank higher than last years 4th 
place.
Cutrone believes that we have a 
strong freshman unit... we will have

strong but inexperienced freshmen 
group.
Junior Mike Berty stated that we 
believe we can make it to second place 
in the UAA tournament.

The 1995 spring indoor track 
season is now well underway and 
| both the mens and womens 
teams are doing extremely well.
This past week, the teams ran 
at the Robert Morris College Ini vitational on Friday and select 
athletes participated in the West 
[Virginia University Invitational 
on Saturday.
In West Virginia, junior Missy 
Baustert finished second overall 
t the 800-meters and was the 
first Division III finisher.
In the 3,000-meters, sophomore 
Becky Buchheit placed fifth and 
freshman Melissa Lott placed 
eighth. Also impressive for the 
women was the distance medley 
relay, in which Buchheit, Lott,

Kelly OBrien came back with a 
third place finish in the 55-meter 
hurdles. In the high jump, sopho
more Sarah Pacocha placed sec
ond. A second place finish in the 
4x400 relay rounded out the scor
ing for the women.
The men also have a number of 
notable athletes. Senior Jason 
Grusky is the number one shotputter in the UAA with a dis
tance of 464".
Freshman Peter Hunt is up 
with the leading high jumpers 
with a height of 6'4.5". Sopho
more John Krugh should be a 
contender in the conference cham
pionships in the half mile.
Both the mens and womens 
coaches agree that their teams 
are doing well despite the disad
vantages that they have faced 
this season.
Because school came back from 
winter break a week later than
usual this year, both teams have 
had less time to practice together, 
and the coaches feel that this has 
really hurt the team.
Dario Donatelli, the womens 
coach, said that although his team 
has been performing well we still 
have a little work to do before 
championships.
Gary Meckley, the coach for the 
mens team, feels that the weather 
this weekend can only hurt the 
team.
Overall, Meckley feels that the 
mens team really does not have 
the talent that theyve had in the 
past; they were hurt by the late 
start and the bad facilities. De
spite the hardships, Meckley feels 
that his hurdlers are probably 
the best in the UAA and that his 
400-meter runners are also ex
tremely competitive.
He says, My runners are eager 
and enthusiastic about the sea

Looking towards the UAA 
Championships in March, 
Meckley said, When you only 
have four [chances to run] com
pared to the eight or nine that 
other teams have, you get the 
idea that you better use the in
door season to improve your out

athletes to try to compete in a few 
weeks.
He said, You just do your best 
and hope that you can catch up in 
the outdoor season.

Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
Well that was easy. The 49ers offen
sive players only had to push them
selves a little harder than they had in 
practice in the preceding week. The 
Chargers obvious weakness over the 
middle that the Steelers had exploited 
so well two week previous was still there. 
In fact, Steve Young exploited the weak
ness on the first two 49er drives to lead 
his team to a 14-0 lead only five minutes 
into the game.
The Chargers were only able to stop 
the 49ers offense once in the whole first 
half and trailed 28-10 at halftime.
The second half wasnt much different 
as the 49ers scored three more touch
downs to go on to win their fifth all time 
Super Bowl victory by a score of 49-26.
The best way to describe the Chargers 
season is to compare it with the movie 
Rudy. If you havent seen the movie, 
Rudy is a college kid whos dream is to 
play football for Notre Dame, but he is 
too small. Hes got plenty of heart, which 
he demonstrates on the practice field, 
but he is not nearly talented enough to 
play in a real game. Fortunately, the 
movie has a happy ending; the Chargers 
season did not.
The Chargers, on paper, are probably 
an 8-8 team. Most people didnt even 
think they had a chance at the playoffs. 
However, with great coaching and a lot
of heart, this team went to the Super 
Bowl. The problem was that the oppo
nent wanted to win just as badly and 
possessed three or four times the talent 
that the Chargers did.
The 49ers have 
wanted to win the Su
per Bowl in the worst 
way since they lost to 
the Cowboys in the NFC 
Championship game 
last season. Unlike pre
vious years when the 
49ers would show their 
professionalism in de
feat, I dont think the 
49ers took that loss too 
well.
This year the 49ers 
were on a mission. Add 
to that the fact that the 
49ers signed a ton of tal
ented veterans on de
fense during the off-sea
son who were looking to 
win a Super Bowl before 
their careers were fin
ished and you create a 
49er team that is tough 
to beat.
On top of it all, Steve 
Young was looking to fi
nally get out of the 
shadow of Joe Montana, 
which he did by winning 
the championship and 
the Super Bowl MVP 
award. I dont think 
there was much of any
thing that could have 
stopped the 49ers last 
week.
Theres not much more 
to say about the Super 
Bowl so lets start look
ing ahead down the road.
Next year the 49ers and Cowboys will 
once again be the two teams to beat, but 
it will depend on what effect free agency 
has on both teams rosters.
In the AFC, the Chargers will be tough 
again next year, but I feel that this
lopsided Super Bowl defeat could hurt 
the teams drive.
The Steelers will be back in the thick 
of things, but how far they will go will 
depend on how much free agency changes 
the team.
The Dolphins 
and Chiefs could 
take a tumble 
next year if ei
ther Dan Marino 
or Joe Montana 
decide to retire. 
The Patriots 
could have the 
brightest future 
ahead of them a 
few years down 
the road.
But who 
knows? This is 
the AFC, the 
Bengals could be 
in the Super 
Bowl next year 
for all we know.
So lets hand 
out some awards 
for the 1994NFL 
football season.
Defensive 
Player of the 
Year: Junior 
Seau
Forget about 
Deion Sanders. 
Sure, he can 
cover thanks to 
his speed, but he 
doesnt do it all 
like Seau.
The reason  
the Chargers av
erage defense 
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art Co-Editor was able to take
the Chargers as far as it did was because 
of Seau.
Offensive Player of the Year: Barry 
Sanders
Sure, Steve Young had a great year 
but he had Jerry Rice on the other end of 
all of his passes. Sanders had a great 
year with hardly any help from the Li. 
ons offensive line.
Best Turnaround of 1994: Charg. 
ers (dah!)
Most Dominating, Ridiculously 
Good Offense: The Champs!
Most Dominating Defense; 
Steelers
Give them the best linebacking corp 
award, too. Did I hear someone i 
Browns?
Best Defensive Line: Cowboys
All I have to say is  Charles Haley.
Best Secondary: 49ers
Best Offensive Line: Browns
They gave up the fewest sacks and ran 
the ball well.
Any other Offensive Awards: 49ers
Finally, I have a theory for next years 
Super Bowl. The Chargers backup quar
terback Gale Gilbert played for the Bills 
last year and in fact played for all four 
Super Bowl losers. If the Chargers trade 
Gilbert to the NFC maybe the AFC could 
finally win a Super Bowl. Its a possibil
ity anyway.
John Weber is a senior civil engineer
ing major. His contributions to the Tar
tan have been greatly appreciated.
Super Bowl bores, spawns awards
Intramural basketball provides fun and diversion
Well, OK, maybe Im going a 
little overboard, but not much.
For those of us not skilled or 
motivated enough to play a var
sity sport, CMU intramurals are 
an escape; a way to capture a 
little bit of glory in every sport 
from football and basketball to 
chess and pinochle (pinochle!?). 
But of all the IM sports, basket
ball is probably the most impor
tant.
Why do I say this? Water polo 
fans may wonder. Two reasons. 
The first is easy. My editor would 
take away my basketball column 
if I said something different.
The second should be familiar 
to you overworked, overstressed 
CMU students. Anyone ever 
heard of a thing called cabin fe
ver? In case some of you havent 
noticed, its winter here in the 
Burgh. That means cold, snow, 
and more importantly, depres
sion.
Have you ever looked at the 
people trudging, heads down, 
across campus? You practically 
have to punch someone in the 
face to get a simple hello, al
though Im not sure if I would go 
to that extreme for a simple salu
tation.
The point is, life here sucks, 
and in the winter its worse, and 
we need something to do.
For many of us, that something 
is sports, and in the winter, bas
ketball is the easiest sport to play. 
All you need is a court and a ball, 
although if youve ever tried to 
play hoops at Carnegie Mellon 
on a Saturday afternoon, you 
know you might have a better 
chance to get in a game if you
were a walk-on for ___________
the Pitt basketball 
team  unless, of 
course, you want to 
slide around the 
womens gym for a 
while.
With the new 
Student Center 
and its two basketball courts two 
years away, this causes a prob
lem.
Alright, so now we have a rea
son for living, but nowhere to 
play. What to do? Voila! 
Intramurals.
There are three different skill 
levels, minors, intermediate and 
majors, and a womens league, as 
there are in most IM 
sports (I dont think 
theres a majors 
chess division) so if 
youve got at least 
five players and a 
dumb team name, 
you can take your 
shot at winning it 
all.
The games give 
you the chance to do 
your thang, along 
with the opportu
nity to blow off some 
steam by yelling at 
the refs, who can be, 
well, suspect at 
times.
But cut them a 
little slack. As a 
former IM official, I 
can tell you its not 
as easy as it looks.
If it was, they 
wouldnt give us 
that big salary and 
those fancy stop
watches to keep 
time.
You play about 
five or six games a 
year, assumingyour
opponents show up. Herein lies 
another CM&T problem.
Because oif the heavy workload 
and class conflicts, many student7 
IM athletes dont have time to 
come to games, and forfeits, espe
cially in the Minors division, are 
fairly common.
An appeal to all professors and 
TAs  yes, school is important,
known as the finals.
This is the big time. They have 
PA announcers, they pass out 
game programs with team names 
and rosters, and you finally get to 
play on the main basketball court 
after a season of playing on the 
side courts and/or the womens 
gym.
For the intermediate and mabut come on, this is IM hoops jors finals, they even have certiseason. Lighten up the load a fied high school referees, allittle. though, as a member of the win... CMU IntramuraIs are an escape; a way to 
capture a little bit of glory in every sport 
from football and basketball to chess and 
pinochle.
Anyway, back to the games. 
After the regular season, theres 
the playoffs, and if youre lucky 
enough to survive those grueling 
contests, you make it to the Full 
Court T-Shirt Game, better
ningintermediate team two years 
ago, I have to say the high school 
guys werent as good as some 
students we had during the year.
We have to give the pro refs a 
little leeway, though. They had English major.
to be awestruck by the incredible 
Skibo Gym\
IM Night, as its called, is pretty 
cool. Theres usually a decent 
crowd (better than some of the 
crowds for the football games), 
and if your team wins, you get the 
beautiful Intramural Champions 
t-shirt, suitable for wearing, along 
with a trophy the team gets to 
keep. Personally, Ill be shooting 
for a hoops championship threepeat, heretofore unprecedented 
in the annals of IM history.
One last piece of advice if Ive! 
inspired you to shake off the dol
drums, get out of the cluster and 
form a team: wait till next year, 
because the season has already 
started and theres no way in hell1 
to legally join the league (there 
are however, different ways to 
join already-existing teams 
wont get into here).
But to all the players of the 91! 
teams, good luck, and let the 
bricks fly!

Fasten your seat belts, pump 
up those Reeboks, lace up those 
Airs, and get ready, because its 
time.
Time to let your tongue hang 
out, drive to the hole, and yell at 
the ref because he didnt call a 
foul. Time to use that no-look, 
360-degree, behind-the-back 
bank shot youve been practicing 
since you saw it on the latest 
Michael Jordan Sports Illustrated 
video. Time to stretch those shorts 
down around your ankles the way 
they do on your favorite college

Top 10 Ways Students Deal with STRESS
1) NETTREK!!!!
2) Watch their goatees grow
3) Bang their heads on walls
4) Piss off other people
5) Fire paintball guns at passing motorists
6) Bowl in the hallway
7) Cry and scream Why me God?"
8) Have sex (a select few)
9) Masturbate (everyone else)
10) Act really stupid
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN 
& SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriters
j When considering the unyielding 
I workload of CMU students, it is not 
J surprising that stress is a factor contrib| uting to the overall health of the student 
; body. Some of the stress is imposed by 
; the rigorous academic environment ...
| because of the students own expecta| tions of him/herself, said Anita Barkin, 
head of Health Services.
While upperclassmen face stressful 
times as they search for options for fur
thering their education or careers, fresh
men deal with the stress that comes 
with adapting to a new atmosphere, 
j Freshmen stresses in the college set
ting include: trying to make decisions 
independent of parental guidance, try
ing to find a network of support such as 
making new friends, trying to find re
sources for help with special problems, 
and adjusting to living in a space with 
strangers, said Barkin.
Stress can be detrimental to ones well)eing when it rises to excessive levels. 
fWhen health, be it physical or emo
tional, is affected negatively, the person 
does not perform well academically... It 
lecomes a vicious cycle placing the stulent in greater jeopardy [of serious illiess], she said.
According to Barkin, the many sympoms of stress range from eating disor
ders to drug abuse. Problems with ... 
keeping, inability to concentrate and 
>et organized, feelings of weakness, diz
ziness, shortness of breath, nightmares, 
sequent headaches, backaches, indigesion, diarrhea, constipation, frequent 
olds, accidents and minor injuries, and 
ncreased use of alcohol and other drugs, 
!^e explained.
Research studies suggest that a 
ersons stress level affects the immune 
|pnd nervous systems, heart function, 
Metabolism and hormone levels... Nega
te, excessive stress may be a key factor 
11 illness ranging from the common cold 
0 heart disease.
So that stomach ache from yesterdays 
Jhysics test might be more than just 
butterflies.
Despite the massive havoc that stress 
teuses on this campus, Barkin believes 
ome stress is essential in order for a 
'MU student to do well academically. 
A person has to seek to maintain a 
tress level that allows them to strive 
or excellence. That level is highly indi
vidualized, said Barkin.
Although 
it causes a great 
deal of stress, aca
demics are not solely 
to blame. According to 
Shreya Khurana, a 
freshman biology 
major, Living in 
dorms and dealing 
with a roommate has 
been a real stresser in 
my life.
In Barkins opinion,
The most prominent cause 
of stress in our students is 
their unrealistically highstan
dards for themselves. Additionally, some 
do not utilize good time management 
skills... Our patient census at the Health 
Service for stress related problems in
creases significantly during mid-terms 
and finals.
With the high levels of stress hovering 
over their heads, CMU students need a 
release to alleviate their pain. Barkin 
feels there is a plethora of outlets on our 
campus and in the surrounding areas of 
Shadyside, Oakland, and Squirrel Hill.
If a person is experiencing the signs 
and symptoms previously listed, they 
should seek help. Resources on campus 
include the Student Health Service and 
the Counseling and Student Develop
ment Center, said Barkin.
The University itself attempts to help 
students in their plight to save their 
minds and bodies. By providing outlets 
for stress through exercise programs 
and social events, students should be 
able to balance out their academic and 
social lives ... The University offers 
means such as the Learning Service 
which helps people experiencing nega
tive, excessive stress, Barkin explained.
By reassessing ones study habits, 
students with stress can mitigate the 
pressures of college life. Another avail
able option which specializes in such 
matters is the Division of Student Af
fairs, which offers programs on time 
management skills as well as tutoring 
services.
STRESS 
affects manyStudents find ways 
to relieve tension
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Staffwriter
With the stress factor as high as it is at Carnegie Mellon, students find it 
necessary to create their own outlets for release. While it is generally'
understood that more serious cases should seek counseling of some sort, students 
suffering from minor day-to-day crises alleviate their troubles with personal 
remedies.
Usually when I cant figure out my Calculus or my Physics, I just go to sleep, 
says Eric Borts, freshman ECE major. Theres no problem too great that sleep1 
cant overcome,  explains Borts. Since attending Carnegie Mellon, hes found 
stress to be a greater factor in his life, due to the increase in school work that 
accompanies college living.
I find it frustrating when I feel like Im not capable enough to do the work Im 
assigned, he said. But, if you constantly worry about it, it gets worse. Very rarely 
does Borts find it necessary to release his tensions verbally or physically; he just' 
doesnt take life seriously enough for such measures.
Most students at CMU try to avoid a total loss of control by utilizing more 
constructive ways to let off steam. When things get too hectic for me to handle,
I go to the library and immerse myself in my work, said Dana Heath, a freshmen 
psychology major.  If that doesnt work, I just eat. Stress is a way of life here, and 
its important to find tangible methods of dealing with it  something applicable 
on a daily basis, she said.
Following along on those same lines, freshman Sofia Zuberi aerobicizes her ass 
off whenever school begins to take over her life. At least in that way I can release1 
excess energy productively, while also eliminating any possible stress related' 
problems.
In addition to the tremendous amounts of work she must deal with, Lee Spuhler, 
sophomore Humanities and Social Sciences student, considers relationships to be 
an equally stressing factor in her life. To deal with it, I usually call up a friend from 
back home, who can put a new perspective on things,  she said. Spuhler explained 
that the best way to deal with stress is to prevent it from the beginning. Going to 
the gym on a daily basis helps me lessen the strain of schoolwork before it gets out 
of hand.
By this point in my life I realized that stress is inevitable so the best thing is to j 
not let it affect my physical or mental well-being,  said Sabina Jindal, a sophomore; 
chemical engineering major. There are lots of places students can escape to on: 
campus when they need to get away and relax. Take the Mudge Courtyard for | 
example. The atmosphere lends to its calming effects, and its also a great place to 
make out, she added. Which in fact, can also be a great stress reliever in itself.
The multitude of anti-stress mechanisms is vast and endless according to Noah 
Scarr, a sophomore chemistry major. When lab stresses me out, I take a bubble; 
bath or break windows playing soccer in the gym, he says. But I receive equal 
pleasure by calling my mom, cleaning the apartment, or piercing various body 
parts. As a last resort theres always masturbation.

Focused on the Internet gets up close with OS/2 FAQ creator
Focused on the Internet
By Kenton Shaver
Last Thursday night I had the oppor
tunity to talk with Tim Sipples of IBM, 
the originator of the OS/2 FAQ (Fre
quently Asked Questions) list. This list 
greatly increased his visibility to IBM at 
a time when he was not an IBM em
ployee, and provided information to 
many prospective OS/2 users.
We discussed many topics of interest 
to the campus community during the 
interview, including IBMs future prod
uct plans.
Q. Can you describe your position 
at IBM?
A. Thats a tough question to answer 
in just a few words. I am part of the 
Personal Software Marketing group lo
cated in the Midwestern United States 
based in Chicago, Illinois.
I concentrate on demonstrating OS/2 
Warp and related products to various 
audiences, and I work on areas such as 
local media relations. Although Im based 
in Chicago, I fairly frequently travel 
elsewhere, depending on where Im 
needed.
Q. How did you go about getting 
such a position at IBM? I under
stand that you started out on OS/2- 
related USENET newsgroups?
A. There was quite a bit of discussion 
involved but basically IBM asked me to 
join, and over time, we reached an 
agreement. Im currently on leave from 
the University of Chicago.
Q. I understand that you earned a 
lot of respect from people at IBM for 
putting together the OS/2 FAQ 
which you distributed through the 
USENET. Can you tell me anything 
about that?
A. Sure. It has been a popular conven
tion for a volunteer to step forward and
collect, edit, and compile information 
posted to Internet newsgroups into a 
document called a Frequently Asked 
Questions List. For the newsgroups, as 
an active participant, I decided to take 
up the task.
The first version covered OS/21.3, and 
it was about 10 questions and answers. 
Over time, the OS/2 FAQ List grew and 
evolved so that it has been popular even 
outside the Internet. Although the cur
rent version is from April, 1994, an OS/
2 Warp update is due shortly.
Q. From you? Does IBM now take 
any responsibility for its contents?
A. Its still my project. There are people 
inside IBM reviewing drafts right now, 
and many have made excellent sugges
tions, but I still write and edit the docu
ment.
Q. Warp is billed as the on-ramp 
to the Internet. What view do you 
have of the commercialization of 
the Internet itself?
A. Well, to start, I wouldnt equate OS/
2 Warp with the commercialization of 
the Internet. OS/2 Warp provides a pow
erful, easy-to-use package for connectingto the Internet that anybody canuse. 
I think that should be separated from 
commercial uses of the Internet.
I think people who wish to use the 
Internet for commercial purposes need 
to stick to some basic principles. One is 
that unsolicited commercial traffic 
(junk email, disruption of newsgroups, 
etc.) is definitely out of line.
Also, using publicly funded parts of 
the Internet for either unsolicited com
mercial traffic or traffic between two 
commercial institutions is also out of 
line. Otherwise, generally speaking, I 
think having commercial organizations 
on the Internet is beneficial.
Q. I understand that the version 
of Warp IBM is developing for its 
PowerPC processors is based on 
CMUs Mach microkernel. Can you 
tell us what we will see when that 
package starts selling?
A. Yes. Theres been a lot of confusion 
on that issue, mainly because people 
were looking at project names and core 
technologies rather than what we were 
using those technologies to achieve.
Quite simply, we plan to release a
version of OS/2 Warp written for the 
PowerPC processor. To do that, we de
cided to license proven technology and 
create a microkernel design based on 
Carnegie Mellons Mach efforts.
This IBM mircrokemel is already li
censed by other companies, including 
DEC, for use in their projects. But, while 
the plumbing is quite interesting, what 
youll see with OS/2 Warp for PowerPC 
is exactly what you see today.
When you use your PowerPC system, 
youll use the Workplace Shell. Youll 
double click on program icons to start 
applications (DOS, Windows, and OS/2) 
just as you do today.
As a software developer, you write a 
32-bit OS/2 Warp application for Intel 
today and simply recompile it to bring it 
to the PowerPC. So, for both users and 
developers, its the same interface.
The difference is that now you can 
choose to run your software on a powertions much more easily.
To users, Taligents work will result in 
less expensive, friendlier, and more use
ful applications which can be very easily 
used in conjunction with other applica
tions.
I believe youll see Taligents work 
come to fullest flower on OS/2 Warp 
first, just because its farthest along in 
providing these advantages to program
mers and users.
Q. Can you tell us anything about 
the CHRP platform and OpenDoc 
software technology?
A. You will see OpenDoc on OS/2 Warp 
in 1995. OpenDoc is a set of software 
standards with contributions from many 
companies, especially IBM and Apple.
The Component Integration Labs (CIL) 
is an organization which has been cre
ated to provide easy access to OpenDoc
"I think it's very important that the software 
industry work toward using common standards. 
A perfect example is the CMU Mach design...  
Tim Sipples, Creator of OS/2 FAQ
ful, inexpensive PowerPC system, a very 
high performance processor. Speaking 
of writing code, Apple, HP, and IBM 
have join ownership of a software com
pany called Taligent.
Q. Can you tell us about Taligent 
and, specifically, CMUs involve
ment? I understand the University 
is on a Taligent advisory panel.
A. I think its very important that the 
software industry work toward using 
common standards. Aperfect example is 
the CMU Mach designits great tech
nology and its something were excited 
to be working with.
Taligent is a partnership of IBM, 
Apple, and HP to create standard soft
ware technologies for use by its founders. 
Taligent is concentrating on object-ori
ented frameworks (and now has a pre
release product called CommonPoint).
To programmers, this effort will pro
vide tremendous advantages, allowing 
applications to be written so that they 
are higher quality, come to market faster, 
and inter-operate with other applica
technology  we dont want a single 
company to control these standards.
OpenDoc has been extremely well re
ceived and embraced by practically ev
eryone in the software industry, both 
because of its power and its simplicity. 
The software standards include SOM 
(IBMs System Object Model), Bento (a 
common information storage definition), 
and other technologies so that applica
tions will be changed to interact with 
other much more easily.
Right now, theres a hard distinction 
between applications and data. For ex
ample, a word processor is used to edit 
documents.
I like to think of OpenDoc as a way to 
break down that artificial distinction so 
that we always work with documents 
and worry less about the tools them
selves.
The document itself can contain text, 
pictures, sound, video, and embedded 
objects which are complete applica
tions themselves.
Information stays linked and updates 
dynamically, and you dont have to worry
about where your information is 
to make that link work.
For example, a graph will always re. 
fleet the latest numbers in a real tim6 
feed from a stock market ticker over 
your modem.
Manipulating your documents and 
working with these links will be a simp]e 
drag-and-drop. And, not surprisingly 
OS/2 Warp is positioned to be the worldj 
best OpenDoc environment because o| 
its big head start in technologies.
Youre already seeing a glimpse ofthe 
power and ease-of-use of OpenDoc with 
the IBM Works package in todays 
Warp.
Q. I understand the development 
platform for Taligent is IBMs unix, 
AIX. Wouldnt we expect to see 
Commonpoint for AIX before OS/21
A. Youll see CommonPoint across sev
eral operating systems, certainly. Pre. 
released versions of CommonPoint are 
available for both OS/2 and AIX today,
Q. Would you like to add anything 
on the subjects we have discussed 
or on other topics?
A. I think one of the most exciting 
developments well see in the near ft. 
ture is more bandwidth in both direc
tions into the home.
Right now, Im communicating with 
you over a dial-up modem connection at 
14.4 Kbps. At some point in the near 
future, Ill be able to plugin and commu
nicate with you, real time, using audio 
or even video.
Perhaps over cable television lines, 
perhaps over fiber optic connections into 
the home, but theres going to be enor
mous growth to satisfy the growing de
mand for bandwidth into homes ant 
businesses.
I think software has to be ready for 
that demand, and I dont know of any 
better package than OS/2 Warp for that 
future. OS/2 Warp already has fill 
Internet access, person-to-person 
top video-conferencing/chalkboard capa 
bilities, and, soon, Lotus Notes (for data 
base replication) built-in.
Its core object technologies (along with 
OpenDoc this year) are ideal for oui 
interconnected PCs. And its true 
multitasking is the only way you cai 
handle multimedia and communication, 
reliably. Its going to be exciting.

bunkie. As you may recall, Ive recently 
given you recipes for stir fry and for a 
lovely pork chop marinade.
Now, what could go better with these 
recipes than steamed dumplings and 
broiled tomatoes? Nothing, thats what. 
But I wasnt thinking so clearly (the 
pleasure of homemade pasta can do that 
to a person), and, rather than a timely 
dissemination of entire meals, Ive been 
giving out dishes practically at random. 
Sorry. I hope I havent lost credibility 
with my public.
Chinese Pork Dumplings
1 lb ground pork
3 Tbs. soy sauce
1/4 tsp. sugar
2 scallions, chopped
1 Tbs. cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup 
of hot water
pepper
chopped water chestnuts
2 cups flour
2 cups boiling water
You know how wonderful dumplings 
are, and how they cost about 75 cents 
apiece at your average Chinese restau
rant? Wait til you get a load of how 
cheap, easy, and delicious they are home
made. Simply chop the water chestnuts 
and green onion, and combine all the 
by Jason HOtn ingredients (except the water and flour) 
in a big bowl, mixing thoroughly by 
hand.
Once this is done, combine the boiling 
water with the flour in a bowl, mixing 
until it forms a dough. Turn the dough 
onto a floured counter and knead with 
floured hands. Now, this is literally the 
simplest dough possible, and was one of 
the first I ever made (cookies aside) 
As for the dipping sauce, its more 
than just soy, but Im not certain what; 
Ive had varying degrees of success in 
recreating it, and tastes vary, so experi
ment for yourself. My recommendations 
include teriyaki sauce, steak sauce (tiny 
bit), sesame oil, and scallions (not so 
much a recommendation as a necessity). 
Your friends wont believe youve made 
them yourself (except the ones who 
helped), and you wont believe how good 
it is.
Boiled Tomatoes
big, vine-ripened tomatoes
cheese
Italian spices
APhiO serves many
Cut out the stem, then slice the toma
toes in halves and top with spices; lean

Now what could go better with these and light. Broil for 
recipes than steamed dumplings and ^thenUlh 
broiled tomatoes? Nothing, that's 
what.
dont be intimidated.
Just mix it up like putty (if it doesnt 
say Silly, it just isnt Putty), putting it 
under the inverted mixing bowl when 
done (it shouldnt be sticky).
Pick off a tablespoon-sized piece of 
dough and roll it flat with a cylinder 
(drinking glass, bottle, whatever). Plop 
about a tablespoon of the filling in the 
middle, wet the edge of the dough, fold it 
over, and pinch it shut. Make certain 
you seal it without any air inside, or itll 
screw up in the cooking. This recipe 
makes something like 40 dumplings, so 
get some friends to help out.
Once you have a fair number made, 
drop them in boiling water; when they 
float to the top, wait about a minute and 
pluck them free of the water. Cut one 
open to make certain its fully cooked; 
assuming it is, youre golden. If you like, 
fry them up, but theyre ready to eat.
and jack, but what-------------------------- ever will do; broil
until the cheese
starts to bubble.
Ive finally heard from a reader! 
Rebecca Ann Stallings wins a free Old 
Man Donner t-shirt with my lovely mug 
on the front and a potato recipe of her 
choice on the back, all just for pointing 
out that peanut oil is a tasty base for 
stir-fry. I would caution that it tends to 
have a strong flavor, so use according to 
your own feelings about peanuts.
Also, Squirrel Hill Giant Eagle is hav

mushrooms ... and tiny ears of com.

Most students around campus know 
about the C-Book and the Magic Bus. 
They may also know that these are 
two of the activities sponsored by Al
pha Phi Omega, CMUs national ser
vice fraternity. Although they dont 
have a house and arent famous for 
their parties, they do go through rush 
and initiation. But the difference is 
that they are co-ed and their purpose 
is to provide service for their chapter, 
campus, community, and country.
One thing that APhiO does on a 
regular basis is sponsor community 
service events to needy local organiza
tions. These events are not strictly for 
APhiO brothers, but open to the cam
pus community and service is some
thing everyone should be able to do, 
said Christa Houlahan, a junior tech
nical writing major, and APhiOs 
pledge master.
APhiOs Spring Kush calendar is 
filled with community service projects 
that anyone on campus can get in
volved in. All of our projects are open 
to anybody, said Debbie Cherry, a 
fifth year senior in social and decision 
sciences, who heads up the service 
side of Rush. On January 21, APhiO 
organized a group to participate in 
Habitat for Humanity. Students get 
together in this project and build or 
renovate houses in low-income neigh
borhoods.
On the 28th, students participated 
in Operation CleanHouse. Duringthis 
project, students visit the Brashear 
Association, which is a community cen
ter that provides services for neigh
borhood residents such as pre-school, 
tutoring, adult day-care, and food pan
try. Brashear needs groups of people 
to come in and clean  a service that 
is hard to accomplish thoroughly dur
ing the week.
CMU also sponsors the Role Models 
Program, in which kids from the com
munity are assigned mentors. On 
January 29, the members of APhiO 
took the kids from the program to the 
Discovery Zone, which is a large in
door playground.
Projects like Operation CleanHouse 
are always looking for groups to do 
bigger jobs, said Houlahan. She also 
said that APhiO is trying to get more 
community service going. Houlahan 
said, We are a service fraternity and 
we want people to see that aspect of 
it. Cherry tries to plan events in 
terms of large groups. She will go to 
an organization and find out if and 
where they need help. Many time or
ganizations call APhiO on their own 
because they have heard of them 
through word of mouth.
The Office of Student Affairs annu
ally publishes a booklet about local 
service events, and sometimes Cherry 
finds projects through them. This book
let is free to any student and can be 
picked up at the Office of Student 
Affairs, or the Information Desk at the 
Student Center.
Most of the profits of APhiOs cam
pus projects go to charity. All the pro
ceeds from the sales of the C-Book go 
to the Kent D. Schaffer Memorial 
Scholarship. This is a $400 scholar
ship that APhiO gives out to a non
brother for an undergraduate that 
most exemplifies APhiOs principles 
of Leadership, Friendship, and Ser
vice.
Some of APhiOs upcoming events 
include a project for the Pittsburgh 
Cancer Institute, and another to help 
Boy Scouts receive the training they 
need to earn Merit Badges. The fraternity has several community service 
events planned for the semester and 
Cherry said, people are always wel
come, even if they are not rushing 
APhiO.
For information about upcoming 
projects, you can e-mail aphio+@andrew.cmu.edu or check the official.cmu.news bboard.
Career Week promises opportunity

Have you ever wanted to know 
what the top 10 ways to blow an 
interview are? Or perhaps youre 
interested in knowing your rights 
as an employee, concerning sex 
and drugs.
You may even be wondering 
how you can get into the Peace 
Corps, VISTA, or Americorps.
Whether or not these issues spark 
your attention, the possibility of 
a free lunch or dinner probably 
does.
February6-10 isCareerWeek 
on campus. An annual event at

organized by the

This year, Ca

been titled Ex

It offers 60 programs which 
explore topics such as deciding 
on a career, drafting a resume, 
and interviewing for a job, work
ing in service organizations, 
graduate programs, job search
Almost 20 percent of the pro
grams ... are geared toward stu
dents in Humanities and Social 
Sciences and Fine Arts, saidRegg 
Roberts, a Masters student in 
Public Policy and Management 
and a Career Center intern.
This is more than the number 
that is specifically geared toward 
tech majors ... Most of the pro
grams will prepare all students 
to plan ahead for their success,he 
said.
Nearly half the programs are 
intended for a general audience, 
but a variety of events target stu
dents in specific majors, such as 
Environmental Career Oppor

The Technology Job Fair is one 
of the largest events scheduled 
and the one most prominently 
directed toward students in tech

Im going to the Technical Job

any of them and to know what to

One of the complaints regularly 
received by the Career Center is 
startegies, experimental learning that it does not afford students in 
techniques, and lifestyle assessthe humanities and fine arts the
ment.
We want to provide awareness 
of the many career options avail
able to our students, and that the 
Career Center has resources that 
are useful regardless of what your 
major is, said John Michalenko, 
the director of Career Week.
The purpose is to empower 
the student.
The emphasis on increased 
awareness prompted the addition 
of 20 new programs, many of 
which focus on specific majors 
and careers.
One of the features of this years 
Career Week are seminars called 
Soup and Strategies.
These programs offer lunch for 
the first 40 students to attend 
and focus on general career infor
mation including how to attend a
same opportunities and resources 
accessible to students in techni

Were here to accommodate all 
majors and careers, said 
Michalenko.
Beth Miller, Placement Coun
selor at the Career Center added, 
Unfortunately some majors are 
more prone to recruiting, but we 
do have things for them ... Career 
Week will open up that aware
ness.
In organizing events and 
speakers for Career Week, 
Michalenko and his staff tried to 
address the dissatisfaction and 
needs of humanities and fine arts 
students.
They have worked hard to im
prove both the quality and depth 
of this years programs.

Paolo Malabuyo, a senior art 
major and panelist for a seminar 
concerning summer jobs and in
ternships, said, I agreed to do 
the panel because they needed 
students from CFA. Im glad to 
hear the Career Center is doing 
more about fine arts students, 
but we have yet to see how much 
more they can help us.
Career Week exists to increase 
awareness of resources available 
and to allow students to explore 
the possibilities.
The only way to find out whats 
out there and whats being of
fered is to attend the events, lis
ten to the speakers, ask ques
tions, and keep an open mind.
Students come to Carnegie 
Mellon with very little informa
tion as to what opportunities their 
major can open up for them. Ca
reer Week 95 is a chance for 
students to expand their hori
zons ... its for all members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community, 
said Roberts.

Bagpiper receives recognition
of the music is memorized by sounds and

notes by hearing and repeating them ...
James McIntosh, an artist-lecturer on No other country had such a system.

rival, which was led by Louis Davidson, 
for whom there is now the Louis Davidson 
Scholarship for bag-piping. Since 1985, 
McIntosh has been leading the Pipe 
Band, as well as teaching private les
sons to students.
The way that he teaches the bagpipe 
today echoes the traditional methods by
Yard spirit roams
ace in England. This honor was insti
tuted in 1917 by King Ge orge V as a form 
0f recognition to people who have con
tributed greatly to civilian British citi
zenry through extraordinary achieve
ments in a specific area of expertise.
Some of Great Britains most promi
nent and well-known figures are included 
in the list of recipients; Nick Faldo, a 
well-known golfer, was honored 
for his contributions to sports, as 
were the Beatles, for their contri
bution to music. The degree that 
the Beatles received (the MBE) is 
the same one that McIntosh 
earned in November, for his con
tribution to music through his 
mastery of the bagpipe.
Growing up in Scotland, it was 
common for young boys to play 
the bagpipe. McIntosh was in
volved at a young age in the Boys 
Brigade, a youth movement that 
is similar in concept to the Boy 
Scouts, yet is connected to the 
church. Although many boys 
tended to become interested in 
the bagpipe and began to learn it 
on their own, it was McIntoshs 
father that initiated his playing.
At 11 years of age, my father 
came to me and said theres a 
gentleman that is coming to teach 
you the bagpipe. [My father] grew
lessons had become commonplace. Three youth. Although this methodology is conof these teachers were also awarded sidered relatively unusual, he thinks 
MBEs; two were Royal Pipers and were that it is more efficient and reflective of
employed with the royal Family.
Bringing his business over from Scot
land, McIntosh came to the United States 
to live in Delaware about 15 years ago. 
Prior to that, he had made trips to both 
Canada and the States to teach summer
the music that he teaches.
People want tape recorders and the 
such, and are very reluctant to sing, but 
it is a more natural and better way to 
learn. In reflection of his feelings on 
music-teaching methodology, McIntosh 
has also made a video, which was the 
first video ever recorded on the subject 
of the oral-teaching method for classi
cal music.
Under McIntoshs leadership, the 
Pipe Band has become very accom
plished. Many of the members come to 
him knowing nothing of the instru
ment, and he teaches them from 
scratch, until they are able to become 
part of the band. It has been difficult 
sometimes, however, being a Univer
sity band. Every year members 
graduate, and new members need to 
be taught. But a lot of our members 
have done very well in solo competi
tion, and the band as a whole is quite 
successful.
Because of the lessons that McIn
tosh gives in bagpiping, CMU is the 
only university in the world that a 
student can get a major in music and 
get degree with the bagpipe as his or 
her primary instrument. Out of the 
entire Pipe Band, however, only two 
of the members are music majors. 
The others are students from all dif

The advent ofthe new Scotland Yard, 
located in Morewood Gardens, has 
brought with it a maelstrom of contro
versy and mixed emotions.
After the plundering of the Skibo 
student union, Scotland Yard became 
a ghost without a decrepit mansion to 
haunt, a spirit left with little solace.
Then it was decided that the Yard 
would be resurrected, and the ghost 
rose up with that decision, timidly 
making its 
way across * 
the street to 
Morewood 
Gardens.
It seems, 
that the 
spirit of the 
Yard has 
been rest

the new environment it...........................................
inhabits.
Students who work at the Yard and 
students who dine there have strong 
feelings concerning the adjustments

added, echoing feelings expressed by 
many students.
Theres no atmosphere^ Said Wendy 
Jones, a junior English major. Jones, 
Abadia, and many other students felt 
that Scotland Yards ambiance has 
not been maintained in its new home 
in the Morewood dormitory.
Another primary concern pertains 
to the way in which the food is pre
pared and the ceremonies which sur
round its serving.
Where does this food come from? 
Who prepares the it? Would we want 
to feed this food to a young, impres
sionable child?
The food served at the yard is 
prepared in one of two places. The 
majority comes from the pizza oven 
across the way at the Morewood Gar
dens dining hall, where it is prepared 
by Dining Services.
The naclios, however, are prepared 
in the Yard itself, behind a maroon 
curtain.
For a couple of students this curtain 
caused a peculiar discomfort.
Somethings wrong with it... I just 
cant figure it out. The curtain there 
looks suspicious. It scares me, said 
Altug Koymen, afreshman art major.
Why does this curtain scare people? 
Are curtains a generally frightful area 
that we all have to face in our daily 
lives?
Or is it the idea of having a curt ain 
in Scotland Yard 
which 
frightens
dent, who

m o u s , 
said, ItIIIIHIMIII IIIIIIIIH-i LJ-iunJr IIIIIUMIWH CUrtain), reminds me of that shifty, little 
dude in The Wizard ofOz, and that guy 
scared me. So, I guess thats why I 
dont like it too much. Its like there 
could be a little wizard back there 
making your nachos. He made me 
nervous in the movie and he still makes 
me nervous when Im drinking my 
coffee in the Yard.
Nervous or not, drinking coffee is 
one of the main reasons people go to 
the yard in the first place, and, as any 
customer will quickly tell you, there 
have also been some changes in this 
department. The coffee, itself, hasnt 
changed, but the container in which it 
is served has.
Theres too much light, not enough 
smoke, and where are the... real coffee 
mugs? asked Jones.
Back in the Skibo days, you got cof
fee in a burly, brown mug, but now it 
comes in a plastic cup.
And maybe this says something 
about not only our campus but also the 
nation as a whole.
Back in the day, back when Skibo 
was around, before the choice of a new 
generation, and before Roseanne got 
knocked up, we drank our coffee out of 
brown non-plastic containers.
Horror Stories
By Tom Harper
Every weekday, many students 
face a difficult battle. A sharp 
peal breaks the tranquil morning 
air. The student, for a split sec
ond, wonders what infernal 
machination would dare; to dis
turb his/her peaceful, hardearned slumber.
The student, cursing under his/ 
her breath, hits a strange button 
on the above infernal machina
tion called snooze and tries to 
continue his/her trip to 
dreamland, butitisindeedfutile. 
Morning has broken, anditstime 
to rise and shine and get to class.
I have two of the above three 
down perfectly. I dare anyone to 
get me to shine in the morning. 
This can only be accomplished by 
giving me a rather large sum of 
cash.
Anyway, since that action is 
rare indeed except in the Finan
cial Aid department, I must con
tinue to plod through mornings 
like every other student.
Only two things keep me plod
ding through the morning and 
early afternoon: Fritos and caf
feine. I have developed a fond
ness for any flavor of Fritos that 
come out of the Baker Hall vend
ing machines.
My only complaint is that they 
faised the friggin pricesl Now 
breakfast costs $1.10 for me in
stead of the usual dollar.
Its enough to make me want to 
sue somebody silly.
Aside from the usual morning 
discomforts anybody experiences 
from waking up, there are a mul
titude of morning inconveniences 
on campus to guarantee that your 
day will start off on the absolute 
worst note possible.
Most exams are given in lec
ture (and I have two this week).
Classes are taking place inside 
computer clusters, lasting until 
the early afternoon, taking up 
valuable space.
Morewood and Highlander ex
perience the transition of serving 
breakfast to lunch, the net result 
being almost nothing available 
when my Frito and caffeine buzz 
wear off.
The Wok and other dining es
tablishments get crowded. Its 
enough to make anyone want to 
regress.
(Short pause while Tom peruses 
old coloring bookes).
And if all this isnt bad enough, 
we all must brave the torrential 
artic storms that we are continu
ally exposed to here in Iceburgh, 
PA in order to get to the classes 
that we pay so much money to 
attend.
There have to be other ways to 
cope with mornings than a chemi
cal-induced stopgap measure.
Note that I am of the school of 
thought that says that there is no 
such thing as enough sleep dur
ing one 24-hour-period.
With that thought in mind, I 
am founding a world-wide movement to eliminate mornings altogether. This calilition would fight 
for global morning rights.
The morning hours would be 
replaced by a national holiday 
when absolutely nothing would 
have to be done. Except, of course, 
sleep.
Then workers all over the world 
would be in better spirits, pro
ductivity would rise, world peace 
could be achieved, etc.
Perpetual daylight savings time 
would be another nice thing. 
Shaving 15 minutes out of each 
day would add up to many extra 
hours of sleep per month.
However, someone would find
something wrong with my rea
soning and then Id have to go on 
60 Minutes to justify it.
Im certain theyll come and in
terview me in the morning, when 
the only intelligible things I can 
say will certainly offend vast num
bers of people.
Tom Harper is going to start a 
band called Vending Machine 
Breakfast in light of his recent 
schedule. His first album will be 
called $1.10 (no, thats not the 
price). If thats not something 
thatll go double platinum, he 
doesnt know what will...

Volum 89, Issue 15DIVERSIONS
The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania6 February 1995Merry Widow shows merit
By H. LEE ABERNATHY
[Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Depart
ment of Music is currently pre
senting their grand production 
\ for the semester, Franz Lehars 
| The Merry Widow. According to 
! producer Richard Berlin, the cast 
of students returned from winter 
break on January 2 to begin re
hearsal, and with the exception 
: of three or four weekends, they 
Rehearsed every day until 
showtime. Based on their Febru
ary 3 performance at Antonian 
Theater, the hard work seems to 
i have paid off.
The operetta, written in 1905, 
Opens with an extravagantparty 
[ scene at the Salon of the 
 Pontevedrian Embassy in Paris. 
| The purpose of the party is to 
welcome Hanna Glawari (Brenda 
| Bush and Linh Kauffman), the 
dazzling and wealthy widow. The 
brilliant costumes create an at
mosphere of elegance and sophis
tication, compensating for the 
rather bare scenery on stage.
As the scene unfolds, the 
Pontevedrian Baron (James 
Lynn) learns that the widows 20 
million francs must remain in 
their fatherland, or the country
will become bankrupt. To ensure 
that her money stays in 
Pontevedro, Baron Zeta and his 
men devise a strategy for the 
widow to marry a fellow 
Pontevedrian, Count Danilo 
Danilowitsch (Christopher 
Laret). Zetas plans are frus
trated, however, as Count 
Danilowitsch refuses to cooper
ate, abiding by his policy: Make 
love to all, propose to many, but 
marry none. The Viscount 
Cascada and Raoul de St. Brioche 
(Mark Bradley Miller and 
Michael Justin Gomlack, respec
tively), with their irresistibly 
charming French accents, com
plicate matters further by fiercely 
competing for the Widows 
wealthy hand.
The highlight of the perfor
mance occurs in Act II, with the 
scene entitled Oh, the Women! 
Eight finely dressed men come 
together to discuss a most impor
tant topic  the management of 
women.
Although the characters com
plain a great deal about the 
treacherous sex, at least they 
understand an important prin
ciple as they conclude by singing 
Whether blond or brunette, what 
they will get, and the man doesnt
stand a chance! The excellent 
choreography in this scene, 
coupled with witty lyrics sung by 
the handsome young men, leaves 
the audience clapping and roar
ing for more.
The storyline becomes quite 
predictable, however, and the 
romantic drama gets boring to
ward the end. Luckily, the sen
suous Parisian Grisettes step in 
just in time to liven up the atmo
sphere and wake up the male 
portion of the audience.
While the performance may be 
difficult to sit through if you are 
not an opera lover, the comic por
trayal of romance and marriage 
relationships, performed by a 
highly talented and energetic 
cast, makes for an entertaining 
weekend diversion.
Its a shame that these produc
tions cant be staged on campus, 
but until the new art center is 
built, Carlows facilities will work 
fine.
Franz Lehars The Merry 
Widow, featuring the CMU De
partment of Music, will be play
ing at Antonian Theater, Carlow 
College, February 10-11 at 8 pm 
Tickets cost $4 with a CMU I.D. 
and $5 without.
iLady Day highlights jazz, history
B;ly JOHN BIGGS
'Tartan Senior Staffwriter
\ Billie Holliday was a legend in the pantheon of 
iazz vocalists. From her poignant comment on 
Southern injustice, Strange Fruit, to her most 
popular song, God Bless the Child, her career 
passed through many 
highs and lows, inter
secting with the other 
great race musicians 
of her day. She was a 
strong and deep 
ivoman, proud of her
self and her heritage, 
and the Pittsburgh 
Public Theater has 
touched on all these 
ideas.
Starring Debra 
Tidwell, Lady Day at 
| Emersons Bar and 
Grill is a one-woman 
show about the life of 
a legend. SetinEmerRic Evans
Debra Tidwell sings and acts her way through the 
life of Billie Holliday in Lady Day at Emtrsons.
Ions in Philadelphia, the play is a performance by
sillie for her friends, a series of songs inter___
p persed with Billies views and feelings, spoken in precision. 
 Monologue.
Directed by George W. Faison, Tidwell leads her 
f: four-piece jazz band through the trials and tribulaH tions of one womans life.
Though lacking in great depth and feeling, this 
[I play still moves and shakes, and can even cause a
tear. Chronicling all eras from Hollidays life, from 
her arrest in 1947 to the effects of her destructive 
relationship with heroin addict Jimmy Monroe, 
the play pulls off the attempt to fit her life into one 
performance fairly well. And, of course, there is the 
music.
Jazz buffs and music lovers will be amazed at 
Tidwells range and 
strength of her singing. The 
music also adds an im
mense amount of feeling to 
the work, catapulting the 
audience into the hey-day 
of 1940s jazz. The band, 
Davin Alan Bunn, Jay 
Willis, Dave La Rocca, and 
Cecil Brooks II, were tight 
and fast, following Tidwells 
phrasings and singing style 
impeccably. The set, as well, 
was quite impressive, with 
its massive steel trellises 
over a small stage contain
ing a bassist, drummer, a 
pianist, and a saxophone 
player. The play was a seamless whole, telling the 
story of Billie Holliday with great strength and

Okay, you thought that you 
I cjould get rid of me. Well, this 
week I had the misfortune of lis
tening to two bad al
bums. One of the pieces 
of garbage is by Ma
chine Head. The album 
; is entitled Burn my 
Eyes. Well, it burned 
*hy ears. I thought that 
I previous CDs I reviewed sucked, they 
r (jouldnt touch the depth 
I <jf crap that these guys 
 do.
This particular album 
c.ame to me in the form 
I of a tape so that I could 
| walk around and listen 
i tb it in my Walkman. I 
j got about half-way 
ij through the second side 
i and the player just quit.
I I.didnt blame it; if I was 
being subjected to tor
ture like that Id shut 
down too.
When i checked to see 
vfhat the problem was:
ought to give ya a clue.
I found this album to be very 
religious. It made me believe in 
Hell. There is a song on the 
album called, AThousand Lies. 
Well, if I told you to buy this CD

Once upon a time, there was a band called the street either.

were now a

thered me then 
was that the 
sound that 
they were get

and not their 
own. They 
were stepping 
out of their nor
mal bounds,; 
making their 
voices darker, 
and making 
gobs of money 
for it. It made 
me sick.
But Ill give 
Ministry some

ally having to try all that hard. Holy Gang, with 
their metal-rap fusion-crap, did all of the actual 
guitar-work to get where Ministry had already 
gotten; a loud waste of tape.
Holy Gang's debut is entitled Free Tyson Free, 
and it came to me with a press kit covering 
Tysons arrest and imprisonment. The band 
proclaim s in its PR notice that it takes the stance 
that Mike Tyson was unjustly imprisoned, when 
a judge sentenced him to seven years on a rape 
charge. At first glance, I thought it must have 
been ajoke. I mean, they didnt mean it, right? No 
one could use that as their flagship messageor 
could they? But they were serious  their full 
intention is actually to set Tyson free. The case 
presented by the group is not really earth shat
tering, and, Gablessem, the lyric Free Tyson
champion? How 
pathetic.
If the music 
were half-decent,
I would give them 
that much credit, 
but these funlovin simians just 
suck to high Hell! 
The guitar sound; 
ispretty muchlike 
Ministry's, except 
that the guitars 
are real ones, but 
one of the vocalists sounds just 
like Ministrys vo
calist doing his 
best Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) 
impression, while 
the other one 
should just sit 
down or go home, 
so I can listen to 
some real music 
for a change. 
Basically, the al
bum just cranks; minute by minute, song by 
song, all you feel is the noise, mixed with the 
occasional burst of anger when the Tyson issue 
interferes with the otherwise merely annoying 
feel of this collection. Ifit werent so amusing as 
a bizzarely stupid concept for an artistic state
ment, Id probably take this disc and lay it in the 
middle of the road, hoping the guy from the' 
Western Everybody-needs-some-money-sometime Union will come along and smash it.
But dont take my passiveness towards the 
object as a way of saying, Go ahead and buy this 
album. Dont do it. If you want to be this bored, 
play one track off of Ministrys Psalm 69 over and 
over again until youre as bored as you can be. 
Then listen to Bryan Adams greatest hits; that 
might get you there. It might

little fanboy that I was, 
never picked up one of his 
books. That is a mistake 
Ill regret. Even though Im 
basing this on one issue, 
Simpsons reputation pre
cedes and supports my 
case. Hey, Dave Sim 
(Cerebus) plugs the book, 
and who am I to disagree 
with him?
At first glance you might 
dismiss DSBH as just a 
regular funny book, but 
that is completely wrong.
This is a very funny comic, 
but thats not to say its pure 
parody and no content. Simpson 
manages to be downright hilari
ous, and still weaves an interest
ing story. However, it is kinda 
hard to follow the subtle 
storytelling when youre laugh
ing out loud.
There are four mini tales in 
DSBH #4, plus one longer story.
Agenda, is the standout of this 
issue, and Id imagine one of the 
best Simpson has ever written 
and drawn.
After all its pretty hard to top 
a satire of L. Ron Hubbard and 
his wacko Church of Scientology. 
Ooops, I guess Simpson ruined 
his chances of havingTom Cruise 
star as the Meddler in the DSBH 
movie!
Even though it seems the Med
dler is by consensus the favorite 
of the Bizarre Heroes, Id have to 
disagree and say Slick is my fa
vorite, because of A Mini-Origin

of the Slick, plus his abbreviated 
romance with the wacky Mooncat. 
While entering the mysterious 
Mooncats Moonlair, Slick thinks, 
Hmm... Not much of a hideout! 
More like an ordinary girls apart
ment, like the many Ive peered 
into over the years.
I also enjoy his angst-filled, 
Spider-Man-like dialogues that 
he has with himself as he swings
across the city.
Since the writing is so creative, ; 
I almost forgot to mention 
Simpsons artwork. Although in ! 
black & white, Simpsons pencils 
are very clear and have a serious, 
yet funny look to them.
Its hard to describe; you can 
tell that this is a humor book but 
the artwork is serious enough 
that you can follow the story.
By the way, if you are inter
ested in comic art at all, Simpson 
is teaching Cartooning: Drawing 
Comics at the Community Col= 
lege of Allegheny County down
town, starting in late Febru
ary. I wish I had the remotest 
art talent because the class 
looks like a hoot plus its cheap.
If we lived in a perfect world, 
there would be a Bizarre He
roes cartoon on MTV Oddities, 
rather than The Head. Actu
ally, a full blown Saturday 
morning cartoon would be bet
ter, but I think Simpsons hu
mor is a bit too mature for that 
time slot.
But, the world isnt perfect, 
so you must settle for buying 
DSBH at your favorite comic 
shop, and I highly recommend 
that you do so.
Be sure to catch Simpson on ; 
his upcoming tour. Hell be at 
Phantom of the Attic on South 
Craig on Saturday, February 
18,1-4 pm, and at Barnes and 
Nobel in Squirrel Hill on Sun
day, April 23,1:30-3:30 pm.
More than likely hell give 
you a nifty paper hat to warm 
your cranium on the walk back

old maxim still applies: Any movie with 
leeches, trains, and lots of retching is a

way, in a heartwarming film for the 
whole family: Lucas. This movie is worth

Mafia) has a body in the trunk, and its

were probably expecting this weeks col

which are Charlie Sheen, Winona Ryder 
as the nerdy girl, and the scene where 
Coreys crotch is rubbed with heating 
ointment. If youve ever wondered what 
Corey would look like sitting in a towel 
on top of a drinking fountain, then this is
scantily clad women with automatic 
weaponry. However, I feel that this 
weeks installment will be just as benefi
cial for other reasons.
Over the break, a friend and I started 
debating an age-old question that I am 
sure many of you have pondered: Which 
Corey is the better, Corey Haim or Corey 
Feldman? Its a question that has baffled 
the experts for years, and the answer, if 
it exists, is both enigmatic and elusive.
The Pros:
To begin, lets take a look at the Cories 
at their best: their films which are actu
ally worth watching. These would be the 
films made very early in the careers.
One of Corey Feldmans earliest film 
was a little movie called Stand by Me. It 
also starred Wil Wheaton, Kiefer 
Sutherland, and the late River Phoenix.
And, like the other Corey, Haim also 
starred in an adaptation of a Stephen 
King story, Silver Bullet. You know the 
story: Corey knows theres a werewolf in 
town, no one believes him, he shoots a 
bottle rocket into its eye, etc.
The Cons:
Like the old saying goes, They cant 
all be gems. And, lemme tell ya, they 
werent kidding! Although the Cories 
have starred in some great films, theyve 
also made a few that just werent so 
good.
For exmple, Feldman made the mis
take of showing up in Friday the 13th 
Part Four: The Final Chapter. The best 
thing about this movie is the fact that 
Tom Savini did the special effects, and 
some of them are downright disgusting. 
Other than watching Corey shave him
away from them. Dont waste your time.
Haim also made a neat little movie 
called The. Double 0 Kid, which is a lot 
like Richard Griecos If Looks Could Kill, 
except that it doesnt have the same 
suspense and intelligent plot. The best 
part is when Corey transforms a Super 
Soaker water gun into a flamethrower. 
Dont waste your time.
Tag-Teaxn Action!
Sometime in the mid-1980s, someone 
had. a great idea: What if we made a 
movie with BOTH Cories? And thus was 
launched an entirely new genre in film: 
the Corey movies.
My personal favorite is The Lost Boys. 
Corey Haim is an unwitting young boy 
who has just moved into a town full of 
vampires. Its up to the Frog brothers 
(one of them played by Corey Feldman) 
to help him stop them. They just dont 
make movies like this anymore (Thank 
God).
Seriously though, it is a pretty good 
modern vampire flick, and its worth 
your time if you cant find Near Bark 
anywhere on the shelf. If youve ever
wanted to see Corey Feldman brandish
ing a water pistol, then check it out!
Another Cories classic is License to 
Drive (Not to be confused with the James 
Bond film Licence to Kill). This movie is 
almost like Dream Machine, except this 
time its Corey Haim who is chasing his 
grandpas Cadillac around. Corey 
Feldman shows up as his auto-mechanic 
buddy. If youve ever wanted to see both 
of the Cories driving aroundin a Cadillac, 
this is the perfect film.
Dream a Little Dream is one of those 
classics of American cinema that makes 
you wonder: Does Jason Robards really 
need work this badly? Through some 
really bizarre turn of events, he and his
Some of this movie is just plain sleazy; 
and there is a fair amount of pointless 
sex (which is a plus if you are fond of 
either of the Cories or Eggert, I sup' 
pose). There are also a few explosions, so 
thats pretty cool.
What do YOU think?
Well, that about wraps it up. To quote 
that tune they used in Dream a Little\ 
Dream, Where do we go from here?
Well, I would like to know what you 
think. I think that its important to settle.: 
this issue, once and for all. Who is the 
better Corey: Corey Haim, or Corey 
Feldman? I want to know what YOU
wife Piper Laurie end up in the bodies of think.
Corey Feldman and Meredith Salenger, 
respectively. It was about this time that 
Corey became a little confused and 
started thinking he was Michael Jack
son, so expect a lot of Jackson-esque 
dancing and costuming. Corey Haim 
portrays his friend. If youve ever wanted 
to see Corey Haim limping around with 
a phony cast, then this is the movie for 
you!
Finally, the latest Cories vehicle (to 
my knowledge anyway): Blown Away 
(not to be confused with the Jeff Bridges/ 
Tommy Lee Jones film of the same name). 
This time, Corey Feldman is Corey 
Haims conniving older - brother. The 
younger Corey falls in love with Nicole 
Eggert, and a couple of folks turn up 
dead and stuff.
Send your votes to cc79@andrew.cmu.edu by Friday at 5 pm, and Ill; 
tally them up and let you know the; 
results next week.
Please also include a brief explana
tion of why you prefer Corey A over 
Corey B. Or, if you dont care for either, 
(or cant decide), thats okay, too.
And just in case you were worried, I 
will not be voting to unbalace things, so 
your Corey does have a fair chance.
Get out there and vote! See you next* 
week with the results, and yet another 
look at some more classic cheese.
Carey Clevenger is a junior creative 
writing major. Next week: who has been 
killed more times on screen, AL Leong or 
Richard Lynch ?
Director makes new comebi
By WLADIMIR LABEEKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter,
Roman Polanski is back. I know that was said 
last year when Bitter Moon came out, but that 
wasnt the real Polanski in the sense that Bitter 
Moon was rather tongue-in-cheek. When Polanski 
came back last year he came with a wicked bellylaugh. And he hadnt been himself ever since The 
Tenant (and, of course, since Manson). Now, with 
Death and the Maiden, he got back in wicked 
suspenseful business. Oh, goody.
The movie opens at a recital of Schuberts Death 
and the Maiden quartet. Cut from the menacing 
violin strings to the stressful face of Sigourney 
Weaver, sitting in the audience; we can see that 
storms are coming. Weaver plays the tormented 
wife of an attorney in a newly-established democ
racy. One stormy night, her husband comes home 
with a stranger (Ben Kingsley) who gave him a 
ride. This gives Weaver enough reason to flip out 
since she recognizes him as the doctor who tor
tured her during the recently fallen dictatorship. 
Its payback time.
Polanski (being the luscious tormented soul that 
he is) is probably the perfect director for material 
like this. As a result of being adapted from a play, 
the films action occurs in one room. Tins is some
thing Polanski hasnt done probably since Knife in 
the Water, but if he is an expert at something its at 
creating atmospheres of almost-tangible tension. 
Only he can make a phone ring as startling as an 
atom bomb, or a small gust of air in a bathtub as 
suspenseful as goingto the electric chair. And since 
it is Polanski it means that what would otherwise 
be a pulp thriller becomes wicked, involving, en
thralling fun. He may choose to torture us from 
time to time, but he never chooses to manipulate 
us. The most suspenseful sequences build up like 
slow music that peaks somewhere in the back of 
our heads.
Watching a Polanski film, one gets the idea that 
all the tension is coming from ourselves and not the 
situation in the movie. Thats something that only 
a torment virtuoso can do.
Especially impressive is Ben Kingsley in his role 
as the man who may or may not be an ex-torturer. 
He manages to keep both the audience and the 
characters double guessing until the very end. And 
since the movie closes taking us back to the recital, 
we may wonder whether the whole thing really 
happened at all. We can only be sure of one thing: 
Polanski is back.
Death and the Maiden is playing at the Manor 
theater, Squirrel Hill.

Upon receiving the album Mountains 
of Madness by H.P. Zinker, one cant 
help but notice the cover art. Being a 
kid of the time of the Transformer toys,
I remember that there were vital statis
tics printed on the back of every Trans
former package, that you could only 
read by using the Special Decoder (a 
piece of red cellophane included with 
only the real Transformer toys). The 
album artwork follows the same type of 
pattern. An anguished face turns to an 
expression of serenity, an outstretched 
hand bends in all but its middle finger, 
and the band members turn into skel
etons. Its an album, its a toy! Yum.
So, on with the music. The first track 
slams straight in with a nice funky lick, 
and the bands rocking like anything.
The singer/guitarist, Hans Platzgumer, 
comes in on an upbeat, with heavy Ger
man dialect adding a thick milky substance to the 
mix.
Unfortunately, he also seems to be just grab
bing the English language, because all Im hear
ing are simplistic one-dimensional lyric schemes 
(My Baby had 
me coming/
Down in the 
shack/While 
she was still

Neverthe

rocks on. The

madness) and! 
Fortress of Fears1 
(You should never j 
see my fortress/My 
fortress of fears). 
Hans has yet to re-: 
ally come to terms with the power a songwriter can 
have, I think; that he can express himself through 
the music, but for anyone to feel the song, it has to 
come through in the lyrics as well. It is clearly 
music written for an audience of musicians, but, as 
is typical of over-ambitious de
but efforts, will probably fail to 
win that over as well, since the 
driving funk-style lick is as of 
yet the only kind of lick they; 
have.
I think what really needs to 
happen with this band, though,! 
is a good English coach. That, J 
and a good vocal coach. And a *'

half-done melodies and lyrics 
that just arent very well thought

China Palace offers crunchy noodles, disco music
ANCIENT CHINESE SECRETS
By Ido Ben-Shachar 
and Aaron Weisberg
' This week, wed like to share with you our viewpoints on the O.J. Simpson case. In our humble 
opinion, there is only one thing more titillating 
.than watching the O.J. trial 24 hours a day: Free 
Chinese Food!!! Every mans wildest fantasy! Every womans fonSest desire! Does this sound too 
'good to be true? Well, it isnt!
! Aaron and Ido are now searching for the lucky 
person on Carnegie Mellons campus who loves 
(Chinese food the most. Someone out there, we are 
! convinced, has a Chinese fetish almost as powerful 
as ours, and we believe that person deserves Free 
i Chinese Food!!!
.' All you have to do to win this free meal is send us 
a short explanation as to why you love Chinese food 
more than anyone else on this campus. Tell us your 
; favorite dishes, your favorite restaurants, or how 
. often you eat Chinese food, for example. And for
this small sacrifice of your time, you could win Free 
Chinese Food!!!
The winner of this contest will be taken to a fine 
Chinese dining establishment, where, once joined 
by the Ancient Chinese Secrets posse, they will 
receive Free Chinese Food!!! Hey, you may even be 
quoted in our column.
Please send all entries to Ancient Chinese Se
crets, c/o The Tartan (campus mail, Box #17). 
Entries are due by February 17, so that we can 
quickly announce a winner and get on to the 
business of eating Free Chinese Food!!!
This week, we traveled a bit farther than we 
usually do for Chinese food. Why? Because several 
people hinted to us that this establishment was the 
best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and, want
ing to keep our journalistic integrity, we felt we 
could not bring you the real scoop on Pittsburgh 
cuisine without trying it at least once. The restau
rant to which we are referring is China Palace 
(4059 William Penn Highway, Monroeville, 373- 
7423). Of course, we realize that there is also a 
China Palace in Shadyside, but well review that 
one another week.
Wed like to quickly mention that we sacrificed 
our lives to eat Chinese food this week. Our friend 
Barry was the one who drove our posse to China 
Palace in Monroeville, and the ride was frighten
ing. Barry, if youre reading this column now, 
please look more than two feet ahead of the car 
when you drive! If we hadnt warned you about the 
yellow Hyundai, wed all be flat as a Mu Shu 
pancake.
But we digress. When we arrived at China Pal
ace, we were quickly seated, most likely because 
we were the only customers there. Of course, it was 
two in the afternoon on Super Bowl Sunday, so we 
cant blame them. We were rather impressed at 
how fast we were given water and hot tea, along 
with crispy noodles. As everyone knows, crispy 
noodles are the mark of a fine Chinese restaurant. 
Often overlooked, they can add flavor to any dish, 
ranging from a bland wonton soup to a hot and sour 
soup that is true to its name.
Our waiter was kind enough to remind us that 
January 31 was the Chinese New Year. It is now 
the year of the Boar. In honor of the Chinese New 
Year, we decided to eat Chinese food, which was 
good, because we were conveniently located in a 
Chinese restaurant.The atmosphere at China Pal
ace was quiet and comfortable. Not 10 feet away 
from where we were sitting was a beautiful 
aquarium. In addition to this, there was 70s music 
playing in the background. Believe it or not, we 
heard Y.M.C.A. and the theme from Happy 
Days, two songs wed never have expected to hear 
in a Chinese restaurant.
The wonton soup had many wontons, befitting 
the name. The hot and sour soup was just okay, and 
the eggrolls were quite delectable and non-slimy.
We discovered a new dish at China Palace, known 
as General Tsos shrimp. While we know from 
previous research that General Tso himself never 
applied his secret sauce to shrimp or any type of 
seafood, we found it a surprisingly tasty dish. It 
was so good, in fact, that we would recommend any
Chinese food lover to give it a try.
The General Tsos chicken was typical of Pitts
burgh Tso (slightly crunchy and a bit spicy), and we 
enjoyed it. Unfortunately, it tasted a lot like the 
General Tsos shrimp, and we found it difficult to 
distinguish the two.
The orange beef actually had orange flavor, un
like some weve tried. However, it had a slightly 
rubbery taste, perhaps stemming from the overuse 
of grease in its preparation. The chicken lo mein 
had big healthy chunks of chicken, a pleasant 
surprise. We found fault with the beef fried rice, 
due to the large amounts of onion present. We urge 
Pittsburgh Chinese restaurants to use less onion 
in their fried rice; it has no place there. On the up 
side, the white rice came in little individual bowls, 
which were fun to eat out of. One purpose of white 
rice is to cleanse the palate between the sampling 
of different dishes. Thus, we found it ingenious and 
innovative to keep the white rice separate from the 
rest of the food.
The aquarium had fish in it, the bathroom was 
wheelchair accessible, and they played disco on the 
radio. In addition to those perks, the food quality 
and efficiency of service lead us to award China 
Palace in Monroeville with four out of five Tsos.
Remember, send in your entries to win Free 
Chinese Food!!! as soon as possible!
Fortune of the week: The person to your right 
will pay your bill.
So where are we going next week? Ancient Chi

THE PIZZA REVIEWS
By Jon Slenk and the 
_________Pizza Review Board
Place: Napoli Pizza
Where: Murray Ave, Squirrel Hill
 This week we veritably feasted on 
; Napoli pies. Slice after slice after slice 
 passed across our ever-so-slightly-glis; tening-with-grease lips, to be masticated 
into a mealy pulp which was then in
gested with glee. Dont you wish youd
thought of starting this column?
To be honest, we didnt really truly 
exactly feast upon their pizza. It turns 
out we only ate a bit, actually incognito; 
this week was something of a last minute 
effort to snatch victory from the jaws of 
defeat.
Not only did I forget to call up Napoli 
to get them to give us pizza, I delayed 
until Friday night to try and go there to 
obtain some sampleswhen, of course, 
snow began to fall from the sky, in ear
nest, for almost the first time this win
ter. So, this reviewer trudged through 
the ever-rising field of snow and a mobscene at the parlour to bring this article 
to you, our beloved readers. Dont ever 
say we at The Tartan wouldnt go through 
thick and thin to bring you the really
important news!
The Pepperoni
Visually, the pizzas were quite nice. 
Plenty of cheese, a fairly thin crust, and 
a mouth-watering odor had us looking 
forward to eating. The pepperoni itself 
turned out to be nothing special.
It was a tad salty for our tastes, sliced 
thin, which some like, and there was a 
decent amount of it. The crust, as al
ready mentioned, was nice and thin. The 
sauce was ... well, below par: not thick 
enough and with only an occasional hint 
of tomatoey flavor.
We felt the cheese was salty and oily, 
which pretty much 
sums up cheese on 
pizza in general 
(mmm, salty and
oily! thats why some of us like pizza so 
much).
The Specialty
We put on our most innocent, gee, Im 
sure not a reviewer for the infamous 
Tartan Pizza Reviews,"expressions and 
ordered an onion, sausage, mushroom 
and green pepper pie.
The toppings were quite good; in par
ticular, the sausage wasnt like rabbit 
droppings, exactly, and the green pep
per was fully cooked (some reviewers 
dont like it crunchy). Unfortunately, 
the gestalt of it all suffered due to the 
lackluster sauce.
The Numbers
Crust: Here we gave a low score of 5 
and a high of 6.
Sauce: A low of 3 and a high of 6.
Cheese: This received a flat rating of 5.
Pepperoni: Some liked it more than 
others: a low of 5, a high of 7.
Specialty: Pretty good scoring with a 
low of 6 and a high of 7.
In Conclusion
If we do some mental mathematics, we 
get an average score of 6. Not bad; go 
check it out (and if youre willing to trek 
out to the establishment, theres also a 
pretty good beer selection).
Seduction spellbinds viewers
By DAVID KORAN
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Film: The Last Seduction (R) 
Rating: See it now, or youll be 
kicking yourself later...
Theatre: The Rex, Southside 
(admission $5.50 adults, $3.50 
students w/ ID)
Showing: 2:00+, 4:15+, 7:30, 
9:45, Midnight* (* Friday, Sat
urday only; + Saturday, Sunday 
only)
I do have to admit, this was the 
first movie Ive seen in a long 
time that I was completely satis
fied with when I left the theatre. 
Is would have paid 10 dollars to 
see this film, easily.
As the title best describes it, 
this a very sultry and seductive 
movie, a film that brings you to 
 the point of saying, OOOOH, 
thats gotta hurt!
The filmmaking moves very 
well within context, keeping each 
scene well paced, effortlessly glid
ing the story along its path.
The story is set in New York, 
and begins in New York City, 
introducing us to Bridget Gre
gory (Linda Fiorentino) and her 
dubious husband Clay (Bill Pull
man). Shes a high pressure sales 
manager in a rare coin dealer; 
hes a struggling doctor, resort
ing to pulling off a minor drug 
deal selling medical cocaine to 
pay off a loan-shark. This is where 
the trouble begins.
While deciding what to do with 
the $700,000 from the drug deal, 
Bridget makes off with the cash 
in an effort to leave for Chicago 
and get a divorce from Clay, thus 
becoming the sole owner of be
gotten cash.
While on her planned 16-hour 
trip, she winds up in Beston, NY, 
and in an effort to keep the money 
and divorce legal, decides to stay 
there and get a job and changes 
her name to Wendy. Here, she 
has an unforgettable run in with 
Mike Swale (Peter Berg), and 
then the fun begins.
Mike sees Bridget as his way 
out of being tied down in thecowtown of Beston. Bridget sees 
Mike as the designated fuck, as 
well as a pawn in her game to get 
revenge on her estranged hus
band. The selection of Mike by
Bridget / Wendy to be her sex 
partner leads to many of the most 
memorable and humorous scenes 
in the movie, the least of which 
are the settings and surround
ings in which they take place. It 
contains very dry, but thorough 
humor which is placed smartly 
and seamlessly into the film.
Wendys modus operandi for 
revenge against Clay, who also 
takes extreme measures, grows 
to monumental proportions as 
she weaves a trail of intrigue from 
Beston to Buffalo to finally New 
York City, where it all ends ... 
happily or unhappily, depending 
on who youre rooting for.
The director John Dahl is com
ing off of his success with 1992s 
RedRock West and 1989siZZ Me 
Again, each with its own unique 
tale to unwind.
If you like Linda Fiorentino, 
may I suggest renting Queens 
Logic (1991), After Hours (1985), 
and last years The Desperate 
Trail. Your weekend trips to the 
movies should include this one at 
least, so forget about DH2210 for 
once, and take a bus to the South 
Side.
Vanya satisfies theater patrons
By W. LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
;For a man who cofounded the 
French New Wave and is an 
auteurism believer, Louis Malles 
style is not that easy to pin down. 
His works range over many 
genres and many tones. His at
tention to detail which passes as 
improvisation (no, in this case it 
is not an oxymoron) is probably 
his only recognizable trait. How
ever, his latest film, Vanya on 
42nd Street, shows what it is prob
ably his one other trait, his sad 
. sense of beauty.
The movie is essentially the 
filming of a rehearsal of David 
Mamets adaptation of Chekovs 
famous play Uncle Vanya. We 
start meeting the actors as they 
.arrive at the theater and literally
before we know it, the play has 
started. The play revolves around 
an unhappy home full of unhappy 
people who meditate about life 
and love in their own way. It is a 
very touching text most of the 
time and the actors do a truly 
amazing job. Since this is a re
hearsal we expect at the begin
ning for them to break during a 
scene or miss a line but they stay 
in character during the whole 
play. It is almost as if theyve 
been in character their whole 
lives.
Malle also captures the essence 
of the play beautifully. With his 
hand-held camera and seamless 
precision montage, he can im
merse us completely in the stagereality. Its nouvelle-vague meets 
downtown NY meets psychologi
cal drama but we are so drawn
into it that not even the police 
sirens outside the theater can 
distract us from the action. This 
is especially impressive when you 
realize that what looks like sim
ply filming a rehearsal is really 
the result of hundreds and hun
dreds of takes. Malle is a king of 
editing virtuosity and the fact 
that we dont notice it is the best 
proof.
The setting is simply perfect, 
an old downtown theater that is 
crumbling but is beautiful, just 
like the characters in the play. 
This is his most original film idea 
sinee My Dinner With Andre, and 
truly one of his most beautiful 
films.
Vanya on 42nd Street is play
ing at the Denis Theater, call 343- 
7300 for more details.

Bopha!
Starring Danny Glover and Malcom 
McDowell, this film deals with anti-Apartheid 
in a rebellious Africa. In this movie, Glover 
finds himself facing the split between job and 
family when his son joins a rebellion.
Directed by McDowell in 1993, Bopha! is 
based on a play by Percy Mtwa. Although it 
does not have the name Harry in the title, it is 
a very gripping movie.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
Friday, February 10
Harold and Maude
This movie, I genuinely like. It is a touching, 
wonderful tale of a kid obsessed with death and 
his special relationship with an 80-year-old 
woman. But, Ive never let personal opinion 
stand in the way of my being a smart-ass, so 
here goes.
From the score by Cat Stevens to the touching 
acting of Bud Cort as Harold and Ruth Gordan 
as Maude, this movie is well-rounded and quite 
a hoot. Harold commits suicide a lot, so all you 
anti-suicide people beware, but otherwise his 
other activities are quite savory. And he drives 
a hearse, which adds to the effect.
Directed by Hal Ashby in 1972, this is a mustsee. A bit more touching and realistic than 
other movies like Forrest Gump and Them!, 
this movie will warm the cockles of your heart, 
provided they are available for warming.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, February 11
When Harry Met Sally
Billy My-Career-is-Now-Receding Crystal 
and Meg I-Can-Do-an-Orgasm Ryan star in 
this little ditty about relationships and wagonwheel coffee tables. Directed by Rob Reiner, 
this movie is quite nice and has Harry in the 
title, a version of Harold. This must be Harold 
week.
There are a lot of funny moments in this 
movie that are quite funny and there are things 
about relationships that are also funny. And 
there is also stuff about loneliness and getting 
married and delis and pecan pies. In short, its 
about how Harry and Sally fall into dislike, 
love, hate, and then marriage. See it with the 
one you love and maybe theyll do that orgasm 
trick for you in the new Student Center Wet 
Wok.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Krull
Not too many words rhyme with Krull: theres 
hull, mull, bull (almost), hall, able (pronounced 
a-bull), and gull. However, nothing can com
pare to the actual movie, starring Ken Marshall 
and Liam Neeson.
This movie is about Marshall, who runs around 
looking for this thing that looks like a big 
circular saw-blade, and his many trials and 
tribulations. Although I wanted to see this 
movie when it first came out in 1983, it doesnt 
seem nearly as interesting as it once was. There 
are some nice special effects and theres always 
that big saw-blade thing thats pretty cool, and 
it has a name that doesnt rhyme with very 
many other words. If thats not a positive re
view, I dont know what is.

THE CORNER TABLE
By Jim Zelenka and Jon Ferro
Major astronomical events, such as the 
winter solstice, the summer solstice, and 
Arbor Day, were always sure to generate a 
plethora of TV specials when we were kids. 
The antics of proto-slacker Charlie Brown 
were a welcome change from standard en
tertainment fare. The beer world's equiva
lent of 20 minutes of animation brought to 
you by Snickers is the seasonal beer. To 
the delight of those who are continually 
confused about the timing of other specialty 
styles) this one is easy to remember  its 
Winter!
Winter beers generally begin appearing 
towards the end of November, although, like
new cars, the actual presence of individual 
selections in your nearest showroom may 
vary. They continue to be brewed through to 
the traditional ending of the brewing year, 
in March. (The actual end of a brewers year 
is punctuated by the brewing of the Mrzen, 
at which time he has a few weeks to kick 
back before the new harvest of barley is 
available.) Much like Instant Oatmeal, Now 
With Stir-in Fruit Packets, winter beers are 
often vehicles for the most imaginative valueadded variations of a brewerys standard 
products. Fruits and spices are the most 
common way to add zest to a beer to help the 
drinker through a cold winter night, but 
they arent the only way. Quite a few brew
ers add molasses or honey to their winter 
selections, and many other winter beers are 
extremely hoppy variants of non-seasonals.
Unlike salsa-flavored macaroni and 
cheese, however, winter beers have a tradi
tion to set them apart from mere marktroid 
wet dream s. Example: the legend of wassail, 
which has suffered in the United States, 
perhaps due to prohibition. Whereas was
sail commonly now refers to a spiced apple
drink, possibly not even alcoholic, one Brit
ish tradition is that it is a hot mix of ale, 
fruit and spices in a very large bowl. This 
bowl is the centerpiece of a New Years trip 
around the apple orchard, stopping at every tree to pour some at its roots and cry, 
Wassail! for good luck in the next seasons 
harvest. It is presumed that the bowl is 
also large enough to dip mugs info, should 
the ladle turn up missing somewhere dur
ing the trip.
Really, we could devote whole columns 
to different winter variations: spicing, hop
ping, fruit, et cetera. We arent going to, 
however, because we have so many other 
things we want to talk about. Instead, 
were going to give you a bonus-length set 
of winter beer reviews.
We also wont be discussing what hap
pened to the ladle.
Jon Ferro might know where the ladle is, 
but he need's prior assurance that he wont 
be the one who has to wash it.
Jim Zelenka fervently denies any knowl
edge of ladles whatsoever.
Affligem Noel is brewed with the same 
malt as their doppel, giving it a rich nose 
and flavor which are greatly enhanced by 
the same hopping as their triple, and a 
dollop of honey. The nose is well-balanced, 
and quite peculiar, given the mixture of 
the characteristic Affligem yeast with 
honey. The malty flavor of the body is 
rounded by the sweetness and texture of 
the honey, and complemented by the hop 
bite and hop-honey finish.
Anchor Christmas, also known as An
chor Merry Christmas Happy New Year or 
Anchors Our Special Ale 1994 (say, did we 
mention theyre different every year?), is 
one of this years most accessible examples 
of the spiced ale winter style. The rich 
brown color of the malt is enhanced with 
the addition of molasses. (Did you know 
its also called treacle? Doesnt that chap
ter of Alice in Wonderland make much 
more sense now?) This combines with nut
meg to produce a rich, spicy nose, body, 
and finish. The molasses itself is most 
evident in the color and richness of the 
body, and the quality of the finish. The 
actual sugariness has fortunately fer
mented away, leaving behind a character 
which serves to enhance the maltiness of 
the body, rather than detract from it. The 
lingering, nutmeg finish is an excellent 
end to a winter nights drinking.
Blue Ridge Cranberry Noel is a new
entrant into the growing American mar
ket for specialty brews. The beer itself is a 
variation on their amber with cranberry 
juice added during fermentation; it has a 
reddish-golden color and cranberry flavor 
apparent in all aspects of the taste. The 
production of this new American fruit ale 
is done with surprising expertise, with the 
sweetness and tartness of the fruit flavor 
well balanced against the mild hopping. 
Jon thinks that more character might have 
been provided by leaving in more tartness 
or huskiness of the fruit, but admits he 
might be getting jaded. Jim is thrilled to 
find another fruit ale in which the fructose 
has been correctly fermented away, leav
ing a full, fruity body and finish.
Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a
new addition this year to the Brooklyn 
Brewerys lineup. As the name implies, 
the beer itself is a dark, rich black which 
does not admit light. The nose is rich and 
chocolatey. The body is a delicious blend of 
chocolate and malt, with very little effer
vescence to agitate the tongue. This easily 
resolves itself into a smooth finish leaving 
behind an almost liqueur-like chocolate 
nose. Despite its profuse mention in the 
above description, there is only a little 
actual chocolate in the recipe. Black 
Chocolate also refers to the specialty barley, a dark variety which is slow-roasted to 
a very dark color, giving an additional hint 
of coffee in the bodies of beers brewed with it. 
Hopped cappuccino, anyone? Dont forget to 
try a little vanilla ice cream in this one, 
either.
Gearys Hampshire proved somewhat 
surprising this year. Last year, it was an 
almost overwhelmingly hopped ale. This 
year, Northern Brewer hops are definitely 
present, especially in the hoppy body and 
finish, but are not at all overwhelming. This 
ale is light brown, and possesses a lightly 
hoppy nose. The hops have a nice, sharp bite 
in the start. The body is balanced well be
tween the hops and the malt, and is slightly 
tangy, perhaps from the yeast. The finish is 
hoppy, with a buttery characteristic that is 
sometimes attributable to an unusually short 
or long fermentation. Start, body, and finish 
are all excellently balanced, and as a whole 
are a surprising and very enjoyable change 
from last year.
Kronenbourg Bire de Nol is a winter 
variation of a popular French import. This 
lager, described as an amber on the beauti
fully decorated, one liter, pop-top can (!), 
might be better described to American drink
ers as a Bohemian-style pils, but is in line 
with other French ambers. It has a golden 
straw color and carries rather massive head 
retention after pouring. The hoppy nose con
trasts with a smooth, slightly sweet body, 
and a short finish leaves a simple, refresh
ing taste. Jim considered this beer some
thing of a disappointment as a winter beer, 
preferring a more unusual character, such 
as extreme hoppiness or unusual spicing or 
fruiting, for this style.
Rogue Mogul Madness is an excellent 
example of a phenomenally hoppy winter 
beer. Looking at a pint, one sees a rich brown 
color, almost opaque, and not much efferves
cence. As soon as the pint gets near ones 
nose, however, ones olfactory nerves begin 
screaming to the brain, Hops! Cascade hops! 
Oh, baby, we got cascade hops! The start 
has a powerful (come on, say it with us) hop 
bite (good, we knew you could), which is 
born out in the body and finish. In fact, the 
finish is so powerful that it takes several 
minutes and a cracker or two for the Cas
cade flavor to fade. An excellent beer, espe
cially for hop-heads, but definitely a slowsipper.
Sam Smiths Winter Welcome 94-95
is a bronze-colored light ale. Although the 
nose carries a heavy scent of hops and fruit, 
this seasonal is less bitter than standard 
Sam Smith brews, and the fruit scent does 
not reappear until the finish, after a full but 
mild body. The mix of flavors and extra 
effervescence indicates that special attention has been paid to the choices of hops 
and yeast. Although Jim would prefer to 
wait until summer for a beer of this 
lightness, Jon considers this complex 
but tasty treat to be one of the bestselections of the season.
The 1994 Sierra Nevada Celebra
tion Ale, while not as intensely hoppy - 
as the 1993 version, is another excellent 
example of the very hoppy winter beer. 
Likemost ofSierraNevadas other brews, 
this ones primary characteristic is the  
Cascade hopping evident in all phases of 
the tasting. The body is yellow-golden in 
color, and somewhat darker than their 
pale ale. The nose is mostly Cascade 
hops, as is the bite in the start. The body 
has a bit of a malt flavor behind the hop 
bite, as well as a dry flavor which is also 
present in the finish, along with a classic 
Cascade tang.
Snow Goose 1994 is this years win
ter seasonal from the brewers of Wild 
Goose. It has a rich, brown color and a 
nose that is both hoppy and malty, yet 
not overwhelming. The taste covers a 
good field of beer sensations, starting  
smoothly, punching suddenly for an extra-hoppybody, and re-balancing against 
the malt for a strong finish. After spend
ing some time making sure we had taken 
good measure of the hopping (Transla
tion: Hey, whaddya say we open an
other bottle of this one?) it became clear 
that an undercurrent of yeast-produced 
fruit and spice flavors was adding to our 
enjoyment.
Thames Festive Ale is another new 
discovery this year, in the British light 
ale style that Jon prefers in winter 
seasonals, this time from the Felinfoel 
Brewery in Llanelli, Wales. This red
dish-brown ale has a clear apple/berry 
nose which disappears in the rich, mildly 
hoppy body but reappears as a fresh 
high note in the finish. This fruit flavor
ing is likely an effect of the yeast and hop 
combination. The unique flavoring and 
fine effervescence are great examples of 
the stylistic experimentation available 
in winter that makes it worthwhile to be 
cold to get it.
We were disappointed this year be
cause we could not locate the 1994 
Grants Spiced Ale, or Rhino Chaser 
Winterful. Last years Grants Spiced 
was an excellent rich stout, heavily spiced 
so that it warmed you thoughdefinitely 
a slow sipper. Rhino Chaser Winterful 
was an innovative, lighter beer  very 
pale in color, and seasoned heavily with 
mint, producing a refreshing bite and 
minty nose and finish.
Overdoses Progress may be hazardous to your health
by BELL VANDERMARK
Tartan Staffwriter
Well, it had to happen. Gary 
Larson retired, so I felt it was 
time I took a hiatus. This will be 
my last issue of The Tartan for a 
while, sol thought that Id end it 
with a nice review. In this review 
Im only going to say nice things 
about the album I was given. This 
weeks delightful-sounding CD is 
called Progress of Decadence, 
and its by the wonderfully har
monious band Overdose. I have 
found that in recording music one 
must always be subjected to the 
whims of ones producers and the 
artists sometimes have to hide
their true feelings. I didnt find 
that on this album. This band 
poured out their heart and soul 
on this album and believe me, it 
shows. With a name like Over
dose, its bound to be good and out 
of the 13 songs on this CD, there 
wasnt one that I didnt like, and
Oh, who am I kidding? This 
album sucked! I just cant lie about 
music. I wanted to go out with a 
nice review because I have a repu
tation for being very sarcastic 
and biting in my reviews. Im not 
really like that, though. If some
one would give me some decent 
music to review, then I would 
give it a decent and fair review.
I think Overdose should take 
some advice from its own name. 
I mean, look at some of the socalled supergroups of the music 
world today. You have veteran 
rockers Aerosmith who did some 
of their best work on drugs. And 
everyone knows that bands like 
Metallica and Kiss and such 
wouldnt know how to walk out 
on stage without a little help from 
other sources.
I didnt just dislike the 13 songs 
on this album: I hated them all. 
This also wasnt like a normal CD 
where there is a second or two 
pause between the tracks. This 
had no space whatsoever. And, to 
top it all off, all the songs sounded
exactly alike. Now, if it were 
good music I would praise them 
for being consistent. But its like 
my buddy Dennis Miller says, 
Hey folks, two of shit is shit. 
And the same thing applies for 
13.
So, when the first song came on 
I gave it a listen and decided that 
it was rather long. After about 15 
minutes of the first song, I de
cided to switch to the next track 
and found that I was already on 
track six. That is a bad thing,
I would say you shouldnt buy 
this, but, really, if youve ever 
wanted to do the microwaveableCD-test, this might be the al
bum to try it out on.
