Senate drafted again, approves resolutions
An unusually large crowd marked the beginning of this Student Senate meeting.
For the second time in less than a year, 
a capacity crowd packed the Wherrett 
Room demanding that Student Senate pass 
a resolution opposing selective service regis
tration.
Two proposals regarding registration 
legislation recently formulated by the 
Carter administration were considered a 
week earlier, but both were voted down 
because many senators felt a resolution 
would not be appropriate until after action 
was taken by Congress, and that the stu
dent body would not want them to act at 
the present time.
Chairman Ralph Sherman was obliged 
to extend audience participation to give 
all those who wished to express their opin
ion to Senate an opportunity to do so. 
Most of the students in the audience had 
come directly from an anti-registration 
forum in the Ballroom.
The first action Senate took regarding 
possible reinstatement of selective service 
registration was to approve the chairperson 
of an information dissemination committee.
Selene Carlo, Design 82, was approved 
as the chair of the committee which she 
hopes will become a CMU chapter of 
CARD. She is currently sorting out the in
formation cards that were filled out at 
last weeks forum. With the help of her 
senate committee and those who indicated 
their interest through the cards, she will be 
circulating a QARD petition and making up 
post cards that students can use to quickly
CARD speaks
by L. Vernon Valentine
A packed crowd listened as eight 
speakers gave their views, facts, and various 
points of information on the current issue 
of draft registration in the Skibo Ballroom 
at 4:30 PM last Tuesday. Each speaker was 
opposed to President Carters proposed re
instatement of draft registration for men 
and women aged 18-20.
As students listened to a discussion of 
the issues, each speaker expounded on the 
various reasons behind his/her anti-registra
tion stand. William Snyder, a representative 
from the office of U.S. Senator John Heinz 
(R-Pla), and a former Vietnam veteran, 
noted that v/ith two million people in ac
tive duty, 800,000 in selective service, and
300,000 in the ready reserve forces/egistration for a draft at this time may be unneces
sary. He said, What we must first do is 
look for solutions to problems with the 
existing volunteer forces. Senator Heinzs

Senators. In hopes of beginning to receive 
some assistance from Senate and others, 
she will be holding a meeting tomorrow 
night. Any interested person can also vol
unteer by writing her care of Senate.
The first of the two resolutions con
cerning draft registration stated: Be it 
resolved, that the Student Senate of 
Carnegie-Mellon University, acting in good 
conscience as the elected representatives of 
the student body does hereby officially 
express its opposition to the reinstatement 
of registration for conscription into the 
armed forces.
Further, in support of this resolution, 
Student Senate will:
1 y Send copies of this resolution to the

official position is that he is against the 
draft, Snyder stated.
Although primarily appealing to the 
women of the audience, Carol McCullough, 
Vice President of the Pennsylvania National 
Organization for Women (NOW), stated 
that NOW is against draft registration for 
women and men. She said,NOW will 
not ask women to resist registration, but 
she pointed out certain ambiguities in the 
militarys present treatment of women; for 
instance, only 10-15% of the jobs in the 
military are available to women.
The Reverend Barry Lynn, National 
Chairperson of the Committee Against 
Registration and the Draft (CARD), com
mented on the paradox of governmental re
quest of military service from those not 
fairly treated in America. He said, In a so
ciety that is racist and sexist, you cannot 
expect that...society to create a whole new
elected Representatives and Senators of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

All charges were dismissed against a male 
arrested in Mudge Graduate House on 
Monday morning Feb. 4,1980. CMU Police 
arrested the man after a female resident of 
Mudge reported that he walked in on her 
while she was showering.
An investigation by CMU Police revealed 
the following: The defendant was admit
ted to Mudge by an unknown student. He 
spent the night in a custodial room and was 
discovered by a custodial worker at 6:30 
AM. The worker kicked the intruder out of 
the area, but did not report him to CMU 
Police, nor was the fact that a key on one 
of the custodial desks, which is to an office 
in Morewood Gardens, was missing. The 
intruder then met a female resident in one 
of the corridors and reportedly asked her 
if she wanted to buy some hash. She 
refused, went to her room and locked the 
door. She too* did not report this to CMU 
Police. The investigation later revealed that 
the girl had seen the suspect in Mudge ear
lier in the school year When he was report
edly looking for someone to buy a gun
As of pressttime, these letters had not 
been mailed. Sherman said he hopes that 
they will be out by tonights meeting, but 
he was not sure.
Senators for the resolution were: Ames 
(MIS), Brna (CFA), Elm (CIT), Houska 
(CIT), Inners (MIS), Jaffa (CFA), McKay 
(CFA), Nichols-alternate (H&SS), Smith, C. 
(CIT), Kelly (CIT), Foster (CFA), and 
Balsom (SDC).
Those voting against were: Collyer 
(CFA), Koshut (MIS), Richie (H&SS), 
Smith, R. (SUPA), Young (GSIA), and 
Sibley (President, Student Government).
Senators abstaining were: Butler (CIT), 
Freedman (CFA), Lynch (CIT), Crump 
(Ex-Officio), Nichols (UFO), and Swank 
(Ex-Officio).
The second resolution stated that CMU 
will not extend our facilities without broad 
consultation of faculty and students. The 
approval of this motion included the stip
ulation that copies be sent to Vice-President 
Van Horn, the Director of Physical Plant, 
and the CMU professor of Military Science.

erations after you.
Tim Kendall, a Vietnam draft resistor, 
gave students a view of what it was like to 
be under surveillance and be imprisoned. 
He told students that they would probably 
have to forfeit many luxuries if opposed to 
the draft. Further, he forewarned students

Police also learned that the Sheriffs 
Department had a warrant out for the 
suspects arrest on charges of jumping 
bail and default with regard to showing up 
for a hearing in court.
The assistant District Attorney in charge 
of the case met with the CMU Police Officer 
and the witnesses (3 students and 1 custo
dian) involved in the matter before the 
preliminary hearing this past Friday. CMU 
Police reported to the TARTAN that the 
D.A. was pleased with the quality of the 
paperwork presented and with how the 
witnesses presented their statements 
indicating that an air-tight case had been 
prepared. The defendant was charged 
with criminal trespass, burglary, receiving 
stolen property and disorderly conduct.
The case was presented before Magistrate 
Turner who dismissed 11 charges against 
the defendant, saying that the time he had 
served from the date of arrest to the 
preliminary hearing (4H days) was suffi
cient, despite the fact that there were

The Draft forum that led to the high attendance for the Student Senate meeting last Tuesday.
Charges dropped in Mudge case

---------------------------------------------------

Write On!
Last Tuesday nights Student Senate meeting was packed with 
members of the CMU community who came to voice their opinions 
about a possible registration and draft in the United States. The majo
rity of the people in the audience opposed both of these potential 
actions. At the start of the meeting, there were over one hundred 
people in the audience offering their opinions on the issues they 
wanted Senate to consider. (See article on page one.) At the end of 
the meetingafter Senate passed two resolutions in protest of a pos
sible registration and draftthere were no more than fifteen people 
in the audience.
Most of the people in the audience had come directly from the 
anti-draft forum sponsored by the Committee Against Registration 
and the Draft (CARD) in the Skibo Ballroom late that afternoon. 
They may have been tired and hungry by 9 oclock, when the Senate 
meeting ended; however, in their absence Senate could have rescinded 
or ammended the resolutions they passed earlier.
The people who left the Senate meeting, for whatever reasons and 
others who are concerned about the issues raised that night should not 
suppose that their efforts have been successful simply because the 
Student Senate passed a couple of resolutions. If any effective move
ment is to be made by students against registration and the draft, the 
effort must be both serious and continuous. Senates actions should 
be followed closely: Students must be sure that copies of the Senates 
resolutions are sent to Senators, Representatives and CMU officials as 
resolved. As of press time, these letters had not been sent. More infor
mation about facts and alternatives to the draft, and updates on the 
official U.S. policy concerning the subject should be made available 
to the students through Student Senate: Students should demand that 
the Senate sponsor and arrange forums which provide information and 
debate on both sides of the issue now, not in two weeks or one month.
As University students, we are not only responsible to consider our 
personal welfare, but also that of the nation and the world. Our asking 
how we can escape or avoid the draft is obviously secondary to the 
issues facing the world and nation. The student newspaper is one 
outlet for effective and constructive debate. Other possible means for 
issues to be aired are forums and informal discussions sponsored by 
colleges and departments.
Your individual response to Congressional representatives cannot 
be overlooked. A letter or petition with 100 signatures is given exact
ly the same weight as a letter with one signature in official mail 
counts. Write a letter which clearly states your position on the regis
tration/draft issue. If you are not a Pennsylvania state resident, go to 
Hunt Library and look up the addresses of your state representatives 
in the telephone books located there.
The important point is that we should not stop now. One forum, 
two Student Senate resolutions, and a single debate with a friend is 
not enough to feed the movement that is needed to stop a registration 
or draft. Work together and demand to be informed. There are people 
who are willing to provide the information. Find them and listen. 
Then respond in the best way you know how.
These are addresses for Pennsylvania Senators and Congressman for 
this district. The TARTAN encourages you to write to the officials 
and express your opinion on the draft registration issue. Please keep 
these addresses for future reference.

Think Twice
Scott Sibley, President of Student Government, has been invited 
to represent the CMU students in Washington, D.C. this Friday at 
President Carters first student-leader briefing. The TARTAN thinks 
its great that CMU was chosen as one of the 200 schools to partici
pate in this meeting with the President to discuss student concerns 
and opinions.
However, we do not feel that Scott Sibley is the proper person to 
represent CMU students. As President of Student Government, 
Sibley has been unavailable throughout much of the Food Service 
crisis, invisible throughout most of the Activities Fee debate, and 
has voted against majority student opinion on the recent draft resolu
tions before Student Senate.
If Student Activities Fee money is used to fund this visit to 
Washington, we think the students should call for a debate by Senate 
before the money is appropriated. We believe that the CMU students 
can be better represented in this situation by other student leaders. 
Perhaps a special election for a student representative to this briefing 
would be the most appropriate action the Senate could take.
Goosed!

Your Privilege
Editor:
On Tuesday, February 5,1 read a 
copy of the TARTAN. Two ele
ments of this particular paper 
inspire, or rather, demand com
ment. The first is the article (p. 1) 
titled Senate decks CA.R.D., 
and the second is the letter by 
Richard Arnold. These combine 
to provide one of the most path
etic and depressing commentaries 
on the CMU student body that 
one could imagine.
The first, an article, describes 
the Student Senates rejection of 
two resolutions regarding legisla
tion on the Selective Service Sys
tem. To reject these resolutions
is, of course, their privilege; one 
of the last vestiges of the demo
cratic process remaining on this 
campus. But the reasons they 
cited! The dominant theme was 
that nothing should be done 
before a law is passed.
It is both pathetic and depres
sing that, of all people, the Senate 
feels that it is wrong to discuss 
alternatives until after there are 
no legal alternatives! Such a fun
damental misunderstanding of the 
democratic method of policy 
formulation by any citizen is hard 
to accept. To find it among the 
elected members of a representa
tive parliamentary organization is 
appalling.
The second (and equally poor)1 
element, the letter by Mr. Arnold, 
opens almost reasonably. That is 
a personal judgment, and I must 
admit that I find myself in nom
inal agreement with his opening 
four paragraphs. However, while I 
might agree with the elements of 
his assessment of both recent 
foreign affairs and recent U.S. 
politics, I cannot accept, nor 
allow to go unanswered, his 
sudden lapse into strident, empty, 
and possibly dangerous rhetoric.
I could, of course, attempt 
to refute the points raised by 
Mr. Arnold in the latter part of 
his letter. I could attempt to show 
that his characterizations are

---------------------------------------------------

largely outmoded, and that strong 
arguments exist, drawing on the 
last forty years of history, to 
challenge some of his assumptions. 
Perhaps, also, I could demonstrate 
where I believe he has confused 
loyalty to a country and its ideals 
with rallying to a recent militaris
tic call by a U.S. President. But 
those arguments are not the real 
issue here. Something more basic 
must be touched upon.
We live in a free society, not 
perfect, but one that does try to 
insure a number of civil liberties. 
We work within a Constitution 
written by people who were deeply 
concerned with the basic conflict 
between the rights of citizens and 
the necessary powers of the state. 
It is a difficult and ever-changing 
problem, and it is central to the 
debate over both registration and 
the draft.
One could make the case that 
the major difference between our 
society, and other described as 
totalitarian, is simply that we 
choose to emphasize, to hold as 
precious, the rights of the citizen. 
Other countries have gone toward 
the opposite end of the spectrum, 
assuming that the citizens rights 
are subordinate to the needs of 
the state. The decision, on, our 
part, to hold the citizens rights, 
even in difficult times, is what 
makes this a free society. It is 
also the essence of what makes 
this society worth defending.
Mr. Arnold, I think your 
rhetoric, and the relatively un
questioning acceptance of recent 
political statements that is implied 
by your letter, pushes us in the 
wrong direction. The registration 
and the conscription of citizens, 
to compel them to risk life and 
health, is a serious matter. It is a 
response which must be viewed as 
extreme, dangerous, and tempor
ary reversal of the rights of citi
zens versus the needs of the state. 
It must be regarded as a desperate 
measure, to be used against grave 
danger, with serious debate as to 
whether it is an effective or appro
priate answer to a current threat. 
To view it in any other light is to 
change the balance of state versus 
citizen towards making this less of 
a free society, and thus, less worth 
defending.
Since it is such a serious mat
ter, one must look with caution 
on any measure which would 
make the change more comfort
able, easier, or which might lessen 
the debate. For this reason, as 
well as personal doubts regarding 
effectiveness, I object to begin
ning registration. It would make 
the mechanism for conscription 
all too familiar, and the step to 
conscription that much smaller.
As an aside, I remind you that 
it was once a serious question, of 
great social and constitutional 
concern, whether or not the fed
eral government had the right to 
tax the income of citizens. That 
perspective should remind you of 
how easy it is to accept as right 
something which you have lived 
with all your life.
Finally, I must comment about 
one of the privileges of a free soc
iety. The privilege to dissent, to 
challenge our political leaders, is 
especially important in times like 
these. Consider a politician who is 
using the rhetorical technique 
colloquially known as Vrapping
himself in the flag, also known as 
an appeal to patriotism. As the 
politician tells us, in ringing 
phrases, of the sacrifices that the 
country needs, I can say Wait a 
minute. Stop the flag waving! I 
am a citizen, and I DEMAND 
that you show me the facts, the 
bare bones of your argument. 
You must prove to me that these 
measures are needed.
But the above is more than a 
privilege. It is the responsibility, 
the solemn duty, of each and 
every citizen to challenge our 
political and military leaders in 
this fashion. Mr. Arnold, I 
applaud your willingness to accept 
a martial duty, if it should be 
your lot. If the situation is truly 
that desperate, I will probably be 
there with you. But first you have 
a privilege, a responsibility, and a 
right to exercise at home. Can you 
meet this most urgent and diffi
cult duty? I wish to try and I 
hope others will join me.

Draft MADness 
Editor:
During World War I, about 
eight million people died. During 
World War II, over fifty million 
people died, signifying an increase 
of over 600 percent in humandestroying capabilities, not only 
developed, but used to their 
fullest extent. A recent poll 
conducted by Time magazine 
revealed the horrifying statistic 
that over seven out of every ten 
Americans believe that there will 
be another World War.
If there is another war, will it 
end, as most officials predict, in 
Mutual Assured Destruction 
(M.A.D.)? Possibly, but I think 
not. Instead, I believe that we will 
hold true to form and only 
sacrifice a portion of ourselves. If 
a similar increase were to occur 
during WW III, as occurred 
between the first two World Wars, 
a total of over three hundred 
million people would die. That, 
may I remind you, is greater 
than the population of our 
country. This figure suggests that 
one out of every dozen people on 
the earth would perish. This is not 
mutual assured destruction, this 
is hell on earth.
If indeed war were declared 
tomorrow, you could be certain 
that the plans which have been 
brewing in the stewpots of the 
Pentagon and Kremlin, over the 
past few years of peace, would 
boil over and set the world on 
fire. We would witness the rapid 
development of the most devas
tating machines ever dreamt of. 
Satellite bombers utilizing death 
rays would become a harsh reali
ty. Retaliation against such an 
offence is practically impossible.
We, the students of Science, 
Humanities and the Arts would be 
called upon to build, maintain and 
operate the machines of war. 
Allowing yourself to be registered 
for service in the Armed Forces is 
essentially volunteering yourself 
for such jobs. Registering for ser
vice is not volunteering to suffer 
the consequences of war, for we 
all stand an equal chance of this 
already...it is a personal offer to 
help conduct such destructive
acts. Think about it, now. Resist 
the draft.

The American Bond Editor:
Whats so bad about registra
tion or even a draft? Consider all 
we have as Americans. I realize 
it wasnt the in thing of the late 
60s and 70s to be patriotic, but 
maybe itstime for some pride and 
Americanism in the 80s.
Freedom of speech, freedom of 
press, the highest standard of liv
ing in the world are among the 
benefits and privileges we enjoy as 
United States citizens. Our genera
tion talks about more, more, 
more and give me, give me, give 
me but we never mention the 
responsibilities that go with reap
ing these rewards. Two years of 
military service would never hurt 
anyone. Granted, there may be 
better things to do, but its a small 
price to pay for all we receive. 
Two years of national service for 
everyone, from 19-21 might open 
a lot of eyes as to just how good 
we have it, and make us all more 
appreciative. Rich or poor, black 
or white, we all share the common 
bond of being American. Lets 
have that bond cemented through 
a draft and military conscription.
What about the cries of bleed
ing hearts who say a draft imposes 
on an individuals freedom. To 
these critics, I respond Youre 
free to leave. See how free
dom is offered in Russia or Chi
na. Many people died giving us all 
we have. They didnt shirk their 
national responsibility. Our gener
ation should not shirk ours. Its 
time we stopped acting like 
spoiled brats. Bring back the regis
tration, bring back the draft! 
Long live America and all she 
stands for!!!
Patriotically, 
Roger C. Jaussi
Do They Care?
Narrow-minded liberalism 
immediately responds with realis
tically unfounded condemna
tion, writes Richard Arnold 
(TARTAN, February 5) of draft 
protestors.
But not all individuals opposed 
to the draft are unrealistic. Con
sider what Mr. Arnold writes, 
Only the blind could not see the 
possibility of a need for a massive 
national defense movement. 
One such blind man, Adam Yarmolinsky, served in the Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency and 
the Pentagon. Writes Adam 
Yarmolinsky in the New York 
Times (February 4, 1980), The 
Russians numerical edge in com
bat aircraft is balanced by our 
qualitative superiority ...In combat 
tactics and training, we have a sig
nificant margin. Our naval forces 
remain superior to the Russians. 
Over the last 15 years, we have 
launched more than twice the 
tonnage and more than 20 percent 
the number of surface ships... 
Finally, writes Adam Yarmolinsky 
of Afghanistan, The Russians 
could not move 100,000 men 
across their own bordersmost of 
them on existing highwaysafter 
months of preparation../from 
this information it appears the 
Russian threat to our national sec
urity is far from grave. Even Pres
ident Eisenhowers science advi
sor, Dr. George Kistiakowsky, 
called the Soviet doomsday scen
ario as baseless nightmares.But assuming the Russian 
threat is as dangerous as we are 
told, the draft would not really 
help: Secretary of the Army, 
Clifford Alexander recently said 
(N.Y. Times, Feb. 8)To set a 
draft in place to improve the 
United States Army would be
So what is the price of an 
army, as all taxpayers have the 
right to know? Well, the Rocke
feller Foundation estimates that 
in 1978, nations spent $15,174 on 
the average, per soldier, while na
tions spent an average of $250 
that year for the average educa
tion of a child. Consider some of 
the results for fiscal 1979: Six 
surveillance and command planes 
for an added cost of $120 million 
while Headstart Programs (pre
school training) were cut $20 
million; $89 million more were 
spent on the Army XM-1 tank 
Program, while mental health 
centers were cut $88 million. In 
all, we spent $126 billion on 
military spending, yet about $2 
billion on occupational cancer 
research which is responsible for 
75% of all cancer deaths.
Obviously, young people 
should let their voices be heard 
concerning the draft. This is an 
election year: Senator Kennedy is 
the only leading candidate who 
opposes the draft and the growing 
nuclear arsenal. He has also voted 
nine out of ten times in the last 
ten years against increasing our 
conventional forces. ' In raising 
these questions, this open-minded 
liberal asks the enthusiastic prodrafters if they know the entire 
question or if they even CARE.

his account, his account will be 
automatically frozen. We, as the 
student representatives on this 
committee, are opposed to this 
new mechanism as it stands now. 
A few of the problems we see 
with it are:
- It will decrease the generally 
excellent level of educational 
computing that is now present.
- A huge bureaucracy will be 
needed to provide support for 
the various bits of paperwork. 
You, as students, will be pay
ing for this bureaucracy. This 
bureaucracy will probably cost 
MORE than buying more com
puting!
- Each student in a course will 
most likely receive the same al
locations. As a result, any stu
dent who has more than the 
average amount of difficulty 
with an assignment will lose 
their account. It would take 
several days for the bureaucra
cy to restore this account. 
Meanwhile, the students grade 
suffers.
- Self-education will be virtually 
prohibited. This is a major 
change from two years ago, 
when free computing was avail
able to every student.
- Computing facilities will not be 
improved next year in any 
manner. Anyone who has been 
in the terminal room recently 
can see the need for improved 
facilities just to support the 
current student needs.
- The end result will be a de
crease in the services provided 
for your increased tuition.
- Student computing has not 
increased half as fast as admin
istrative computing, yet the
new policy will affect only stu
dents.
We are circulating a petition 
and a more complete statement of 
our objections. This new policy 
will affect every student as every 
college except CFA requires some 
computer usage of its students. 
This new policy will be a step 
backwards for CMUs quest for 
educational excellence.
Bruce Adams 
Michael Inners 
Computer Policy Committee Stut i dent RepFaculty NeedsEditor:
The January 22 TARTAN con
tained two letters suggesting that 
undergraduate students eat lunch 
in the Faculty Dining Room. In 
one letter, the writer remarked about the parade of celebrities in 
the room, but then deplored the 
snotty attitude of the custom
ers, most of whom turned their 
noses up at the writer.
Well, I can be just as snotty as 
the next guy, and since I am one 
,x>f the celebrities mentioned. Id 
lice to submit my views on this 
matter.
It is a fact that many faculty 
members, including myself, do 
not welcome the presence of un
dergraduate students in the Facul
ty Dining Room. In my opinion 
there are several valid reasons for 
this attitude. First, there is the ob
vious problem of capacity; the 
lines are often long and the seat
ing space short, and these condi
tions have driven away quite a few 
faculty members who formerly 
used this facility.
More important, many faculty 
members think of the dining room 
as a refuge where for an hour or
so they can leave their profession
al responsibilities and relax with 
their colleagues. Lunch-table con
versation covers a wide range of 
topics, and not all of it is intended 
to be overheard by students. 
Occasionally, university or person
al business of a confidential 
nature is discussed, and it is 
unpleasant to have to whisper.
When Skibo was built in 1960, 
the Faculty Dining Room was 
planned and equipped, with the 
aid of funds from the Kresge 
Foundation, as a facility to be 
used only by faculty. Undergrad
uate and graduate students were 
not admitted, nor were so-called 
staff personnel (such as, for exam
ple, secretaries, technical assis
tants, and custodians). Over the 
years, this policy has been relaxed 
bit by bit, without any particular 
plan. The relatively recent an
nouncement that the room is 
open to all members of the cam
pus community stemmed from a 
decision made unilaterally by a 
former ^Director of Food Service, 
without (consultation with the 
Faculty Senate, or any other re
presentation of the views of the 
Faculty.I would suggest that it is heal
thy for the University to have a 
dining facility reserved for the 
faculty and staff. The claim 
that most of the important 
business of the University is trans
acted over the lunch table may be 
a slight exaggeration, but the can
did and uninhibited exchange of 
views that takes place at lunch is 
certainly stimulating and infor
mative, and I think it leads to 
better education. Any situation that inhibits such interchange 
makes us all a little poorer in
terms of what faculty members 
can learn from each other.
To those who dont know me, 
this may sound terribly elitist. 
But anyone who has ever sat in 
one of my classes knows that it is 
not my nature to keep students 
at arms length. I am as concerned 
as anyone on this campus with the 
welfare and needs of students. I 
have needs, too, though, and one 
of them is a little privacy at lunch.
Hugh D. Young 
Professor of Physics 
Just DessertsEditor:
I am writing this letter in re
sponse to the vindictive and en
tirely unwarranted letter entitled 
Banquet Defense which ap
peared in the February 5 issue. 
Let me first point out that I am a 
third party to this situation. As 
a Junior I still have my Senior 
Banquet to look forward to. 
However, I could not let Miss 
Brillmans vicious tirade pass un
noticed. I found her letter quite 
reminiscent of a small childs tem
per tantrum. It was the type of re
sponse one would receive from a 
member of that small group of 
our society who, being unable to 
face criticism, pours forth a tor
rent of abuse and demagoguery 
whenever they are informed that 
they have screwed up.
Allow me to point out some of 
Miss Brillmans priceless gems of 
wisdom. She states the menu is 
none of the business of those who 
attended the banquet. If the qual
ity of food is not the business of 
those who must eat it, whose con
cern is it? Are we to gather from 
her statement that she believes 
that if the seniors had been fed
dog biscuits they should have 
eaten them in grateful silence? 
Second, Miss Brillman asks if the 
food is what really makes a ban
quet. May I point out that Web
ster seems to think it is? If one 
wishes to have a Senior GetTogether, then one should call it 
that. But if one wishes to have 
a banquet, one should serve food 
worthy of the implication. Final
ly, Miss Brillman falls back on the 
old if you think you can do a 
better job, than go ahead and 
try standby. The logic of this 
statement has always eluded me. 
If a person takes upon him (or 
her) self the responsibility of 
carrying out a project, he (or she) 
does so with the understanding 
that it will be done correctly. If 
a substandard end-product emer
ges, then that person has failed 
to execute his (or her) responsi
bility correctly. That person is 
then open to, and should rightly 
receive, criticism for an improper
ly completed task. The fact that 
one person may volunteer to un
dertake a project does not give 
that person the right to screw up 
the project with impunity.
Miss Brillman, I am sure that 
the senior class appreciates your 
efforts and those of Senior Ser
vices. It is, however, very un
becoming to attempt to justify a 
complaint (be it valid or invalid) 
in the childish and circuitous man
ner which you chose. If the complainer was wrong, then no reply 
on your part was needed since 
everyone would know that the 
complaint was invalid. If he was 
right, then accept the criticism 
gracefully since it was your due.

Food Service continues to implement changes
by Doug Kirsop
In an effort to keep the University Food 
Service operation from adding to its ap
proximate loss of ten percent for the fiscal 
year, Director John Eichmuller has contin
ued to make changes in the system.
Were doing more digging to get week
ly sales and labor costs, said Eichmuller. 
He has also placed Associate Director Jim 
Tomsula in charge of all operations to 
give himself more time to work with the 
weekly figures. Were trying to get a bet
ter beat on things, Eichmuller explained, 
so that labor adjustments can be made 
within a week after a problem is identified.
When the Deli portion of the Bakery/ 
Deli was reopened two weeks ago, Food 
Service was planning on a daily revenue of 
$560 to $600. Revenue met expectations 
for the first week of operation, but fell 
to an average of about $475 per day during
the second week. As the Deli cannot meet 
the projected nine to twelve percent con
tribution to overhead decided upon by 
Eichmuller and Oscar Mayer, Director of 
Auxiliary Services, at this income rate, 
Eichmuller said that labor adjustments 
will be made in the Deli beginning this 
week.
The figures used in the original deci
sion to close much of the Morewood Pot
pourri operation were through Novem
ber 30, 1979. Food Service has since re
ceived Decembers figures from the Ac
counting Office. Although he pointed out 
that December is never good, Eich
muller said that Decembers figures were 
predictable they added to the deficit.
Response to the Food Service surveys 
available in each facility has been over
whelming. Eichmuller explained that he 
has had to have them available on an alter
nating weekly schedule to give him time to 
respond and look into changes suggested 
by surveys. People have noticed the 
improved temperature of the hot food, 
especially in the Kiltie Cafe, he said. 
Although he pointed out that the price of 
an item is based on quantity, many of the 
negative comments still concern price 
versus portion.
Eichmuller also forsees some major 
changes in the system of operation for the 
Grill next year. I think we will go more
towards a Wendys type set up where you 
order and pay for your food, then move 
along the counter to pick it up, he ex
plained. Another change will be an increase 
in the use of the microwave ovens, both 
to speed service and to increase hot food 
temperature.
A system that includes options other 
than Vali-Dine is one suggestion for the 
SDC Food Service committee that Eich
muller thinks may be implemented next 
year.

who would openly oppose the draft to ex
pect to feel lonely and isolated. He also 
spoke of what he believed was the source 
of the draft issue: Americas threatened in
terests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. In an in
formal discussion after the forum, Kendall 
stated that, The U.S. government will go 
anywhere and support any kind of regime 
which will help its three interests: raw ma
terials, cheap labor, and markets.
The last speaker was Tom Kerr, GSIA 
professor and State Chairmen of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. In a brief 
speech, Kerr reiterated some of the ideas 
previously stated. Kerr described military 
sevice and the draft as a deprivation of in
dividual liberty and an enormous inva
sion of privacy and individuality. He com
mented that the opportunity to express 
opinions on the registration and the draft 
exists now. He urged students to go to 
their Student Senate and ask them to take 
action on behalf of the student body. In 
addition, he advised students to get them
selves on the mailing lists of organizations 
such as the National Interreligious Board 
for Conscientious Objectors, which is based 
in Washington D.C. and looks into proce
dures and intentions of the government
CARD speaks against draft
with regard to the draft. In an interview 
with ABC-TV (Channel 4-Pittsburgh), Kerr 
said that questions about how names will 
be acquired for a registration need to be 
raised: Will there be access to records by 
all kinds of (governmental) agencies?...Is 
information going to be handled careles
sly? He commented that at the present 
time, the government would be acting 
contrary to a simple free market by initiat
ing a registration and subsequent draft. The 
government will muster you (18-20 year 
olds) in for less than the free market salary. 
A brief question and answer period fol
lowed the two and a half hour forum. The 
reaction of students who attended the 
forum came in different forms, but most of 
the randomly questioned students were 
against the idea of registration under cur. rent conditions. One student said, Weve 
come a long way in civilization; why 
should there be a war? Another student 
commented, I dont want to fight for a 
country where they have no equal rights. 
One student noted that, The lawmakers 
are in another age group completely, and 
they probably wouldnt be drafted. Other 
students simply said moral reasons 
forced them to oppose draft registration 
and war.

Page 8TARTANFebruary 12, 1980
The TARTAN sent two delegates to the 
American Student Associations National 
Conference in Washington, D.C. on Jan
uary 31-February 3.
450 students, representing 150 different 
colleges and universities from as far away 
as Hawaii and as close as Duquesne met to 
attend workshops, learn about national 
issues revelant to college students, and discuss common problems.
ASA is a national association that 
lobbies in both state and national govern
ment for higher education concerns. It also 
holds workshops and provides information 
to student leaders regarding issues being 
considered by Congress or the Admini
stration that would effect students.
Members of a panel discussing students' civil rights included a professor of higher education 
from George Washington University and a civil rights lawyer.Consumer advocate and lobbyist Ralph Nader spent three hours discussing student rights, the 
standardized testing system, politics, and higher education issues with over 400 student delegates.
The Director of the Selective Service Administration and federal military advisors debated and 
then responded to questions for over two hours at the ASA National Conference last Friday night. 
Their opponents in the debate were anti-draft civil rights lawyers and two Vietnam veteran anti
draft activists.
Recipient of the ASA "Congressman of the 
Year" award Jim Weaver D-Ore., got up to talk 
with the conference delegates at 8:30 AM. He 
urged students to be aware and involved in na
tional issues, as well as expressing his opposition 
to the current draft registration move.
Even after over two hours of debate and 
questions, students were still eager to discuss 
possible draft registration procedures with the 
Pentagon Selective Service Director.

Student ripped-off by modeling agency, fights back
by Sue Borg
Gina Cotton, a freshman in H&SS, ans
wered an ad in The New Sun for a model
ing job. When she went for her first interveiw at Van Enterprises she was told that 
she would have to make a $110 investment 
to put together a suitable portfolio of 
pictures. She was also told that this money 
could be paid over a period of time.
She made an appointment to have her 
| pictures taken and put down the required 
$40 security deposit insuring her presence 
at the photo session. She signed a contract 
saying that the $40 deposit will be forfited 
only if she did not keep her appointment 
to have her pictures taken.
When Ms. Cooton arrived at Van Enter
prises for her photo session she sensed an 
unprofessional atmosphere, noting that the 
waiting room had been converted into a 
Photography studio with a crmpled 
peice of paper as a backdrop.
Before the photo session she had her sec
ond interveiw. At this time she was told
that the total sum of $110 would be 
expected on the day her pictures would be 
finished. Gina complained that she was 
told that she would be able to pay off this 
money over a period of time. She was then 
told that nobody else had gotten that 
impression and that it was simply not true.
When Gina returned to the waiting room 
she asked the other girls who were waiting 
whether they were expecting to pay the 
money over a long time. Most thought this 
was so and they were surprised to find that 
they had been misled.
Gina went to ask the supervisor a few 
questions and was promptly told to 
leave. She requested her $40 deposit and 
was told that it would be sent to her in 
a few days.
After a few days Ms. Cotton telephoned 
Van Enterprises and was told that if she 
tried to get her money back she would be 
sued for contractual interference. Gina 
pointed out that she did keep her appoint
ment and was entitled to get her deposit
back. She was then told that if she ever 
contacted Van Enterprises in any way 
she would be sorry for the rest of her 
life. The superviseor also threatened 
her with physical violence, specifically, 
being thrown down an elevator shaft.
Gina contacted Dan Kelly from Chan
nel 11 News and he decided to investigate 
the case. Kelly determined that Van Enter
prises was a legal operation that preys on 
young people in need of spending money. 
They mislead you into thinking they guar
antee you a job, when in reality they do 
not.
Kelly succeeded in getting Ginas $40 
back and got her a job with a legitimate 
modeling agency.

felony charges involved. CMU police Lt. 
Castelli, was concerned that students 
would think the reason for this was that 
somehow CMU didnt do its job. He feels 
this is not true at all. There is no logical 
explanation for the magistrates decision 
and no alternative action can be taken. 
Any attempt to file charges again would 
be double jeopardy and therefore unconsti
tutional.
In response to this event, the Residence
Life Office expidited plans to place a 
front desk at the main entrance to Mudge 
similar to those in operation in Morewood 
Gardens and Donner Hall. Jerry Marks, 
Dircetor of Residence Life stated that this 
is being done in response to what he feels 
is a call for increased security in Mudge 
House by a good percentage of the resi
dents. He pointed out that the desk is not 
necessarily a permanent situation and that 
other reasonable alternatives will be con
sidered.

Birth Control ads misleading
(CCRS) The recent dramatic increase in 
non-prescription vaginal contraceptive use 
has raised concerns about the advertising 
and labeling of these products.
Changing consumer contraceptive prac
tices are the main reasons for this growing 
consciousness. Industry, government and 
consumer representatives say that the use 
of the pill has steadily declined over the 
last three years, giving way to other 
methods of birth control. One pharma
ceutical trade publication reported last 
month that sales in devices other than the 
pill and the intrauterine device (IUD) 
increased 26 percent last year. Specifically, 
Drug Topics magazine found that sales of 
vaginal suppositories and foams increased 
20 and 19 percent, respectively. Sales of 
jellies increased 17 percent.
Safety questions about the pill and IUD 
have been the most commonly cited 
reasons for their sales decline. But three 
George Washington University students in 
Washington, D.C., feel there is a second 
factor contributing to the increased in
terest in vaginal contraceptives.
Advertising for these products, vir
tually non-existent three years ago in 
commercial print, presently appears in 
numerous publications aimed towards 
women, say the three Students for the 
Examination of Contraceptive Effec
tiveness (SEXCE). The influence of this 
advertising is clear: Sales of over-thecounter vaginal contraceptives are rising at 
a dramatic rate.
This advertising has also hit the colle
giate press. Eaton-Merz Laboratories, Inc., 
for example, has for two years run fall 
newspaper ad campaigns for its Encare 
suppository. Last October and Novembers 
campaign reportedly covered 100 campus 
papers and a national collegiate magazine 
at a total cost of $90,000.
In general, SEXCE feels the advertising 
of the $35 million vaginal contraceptive 
industry has been false and decptive. 
And just as the Eaton-Merz Encare sup
pository is currently leading sales in the 
field of about six such products, Theyre 
the worst in terms of advertising too, 
claims SEXCE member Kevin Zeese.
When it introduced the product as 
Encare Oval in 1977, Eaton-Merz said in 
medical ads that In a recent West 
Germany survey of 287 physicians pre
scribing Encare Oval, only 43 pregnancies 
were reported after 10,017 women comp
leted 63,759 total months of use. This re
presents a pregnancy rate of approximately 
one per 100 woman-year. It should be 
noted, however, that surveys of con
traceptive effectiveness vary substantially 
based on compliance and characteristics of 
the study group.
This statement was quickly interpreted 
as a claim of 99-percent effectiveness. As 
Drug Topics itself wrote in November of 
1977: Studies in Germany, where the
product has been available for five years, 
indicate the products reliabilityapproxi
mately one out of 100 women using the 
suppository for 12 months might become 
pregnant. And Playboy wrote five 
months later that The method is 99 per
cent effective.
After the Food and Drug Administra
tion questioned both the advertised claim 
and the German studies on which it was 
based, Eaton-Merz discontinued use of this 
effectiveness statement. But SEXCE 
still finds fault with the companys adver
tising, including last falls. In fact, SEXCE 
filed complaints with the federal govern
ment against the ads for Encare and three 
competitors: Emko foam, Koromex and
Semicid suppository.

Everything you always wanted to know about Vali-Dine...
by Paul Karmin
Many students these days are probably 
wondering exactly how the Vali-Dine 
computer system works and why their bal
ances are out of order.
The computer is leased by the university 
from Vali-Dine Co. and it is preprogram
med to handle standard food service con
tracts according to the original Vali-Dine 
formula. There is a single terminal in the 
Skibo food service office. For security 
reasons, the computer is not connected to 
any of the other computers on campus. 
The cash registers are all computer card 
reading devices that automatically record 
each transaction on tape and display the 
students balance after each purchase. 
Each food service unit (Kiltie Cafe, Tar
tan Grill, etc.) is recorded on a separate 
cassette tape in the computers memory 
system. The entire system is safeguarded 
from power failure by a Five-day battery
pack with a special piece of equipment that 
memorizes the memory for 24 hours 
even if the system were to cease operating. 
In addition, because each cash register 
records its own transactions, there is 
always a second copy of each sale.
At the beginning of the semester, the 
individual^ contract money is initially 
multiplied by 17% and entered at the in
flated sum. The computer operates on a 
decreasing balance system, whereby each 
successive sale is deducted from the total 
until, theoretically, a zero balance is 
reached.
Here lies the problem of the missing 
balance money: every other Vali-Dine 
school in the country operates according to 
the original program in the computer, one 
major aspect of which, is all balances left at 
the end of the semester are lost to the 
student and a new balance is begun starting 
at zero dollars. CMU is the only school that
carries balances over, much to the credit 
of food service. However, this creates a 
problem because the computer is unequip
ped to accept any carryover onto its mem
ory that raises the total funds in one ac
count above the theoretical maximum as 
defined by the type of food contract held. 
For example, if a student has a SI00 carry
over and adds $470 for a semesters pay
ment for plan B, then according to the 
computer he has only $470, not $570.
As a result, Harry Duane, head of finance 
and the food service computer system 
decided to reduce the balances of all ValiDine holders temporarily in order to allow 
everyone to have an accurate account. The 
missing money is on file but not on the 
computer. As the balances decrease the 
funds will automatically be added. (This 
will take place by food plan group. For 
instance, all people on plan D will receive 
their full balances at once when the
computer is able to accept them.
Mr. Duane lias temporarily reprogrammed 
the computer to allow this makeshift 
system to opertate until the summer when 
Vali-Dine Co. will alter the master program 
at their expense to allow food service to 
operate as they choose. Carryovers will be 
continued.
For those with questions regarding their 
balances they may talk to Mr. Duane at 
3581 or see him in room 27 Skibo or use 
the following correction factors to obtain 
their true balance:
Add this amount to your reduced balance 
if you are on plan:
A 353.50 B 235.25 
C 323.50 
D 117.65
Note: make sure your balance is still re
duced.

Food Service vs. frats: the envelope please
by Karen Stevens
By now most of us are aware that one 
of the reasons the Bakery/Deli and Din
ners Unlimited were closed was that they 
were operating at a loss.
I found this an interesting problem 
especially when one compares Food Ser
vices situation (providing food for an 
entire campus) with that of the fraterni
ties (serving food to a much smaller num
ber). Costs are normally reduced when an 
institution can purchase goods in large 
quantities; Food Service qualifies for this 
category. Yet fraternities, who do not 
qualify, are purchasing for a substantially 
lower number of people and are putting 
meals on their tables for less money per 
person, on the average.

is approximately $1.60 and a dinner can 
be enjoyed for approximately $2.30. 
Some fraternities provide for a contract
like program where a brother is charged 
for the meal whether he eats or not. 
Others are charged according to how 
many meals thay eat.
The question in mind now is: how 
do they do it? Complicating this ques
tion is the fact that if one eats at a Food 
Service facility, one pays for each item he 
consumes; however, the fraternity mem
bers can go back for seconds until the food 
runs out. At some houses the main course 
(meat) is only provided once, but extra 
vegetables and potatoes are often available.
Food Service administrators may argue 
that their overhead is higher, and they 
would probably be right. However, frats 
do have to buy their food, provide the 
facilities and energy to prepare them, and 
pay salaries for cooks. The brothers serve 
as waiters, dishwashers, etc., which reduces 
the bill but may be a disadvantage to the 
members. However, how significant is this 
in terms of cost9
In the end, the challenge remains for 
answers to the questions raised here. Can 
they explain why such a large organization 
can not provide the service that a much 
smaller one does at a lower price?

fers exhibits of great diversity, and next 
weeks show is no exception. The Valentines Week show is especially exceptional 
In that everybody who attends, from
 ;ngineer to dramatist, will be able to 
Jiippreciate and sincerely like at least one 
I :>iece of either Eva Cunninghams or 
(Carin Ahlstroms work. The quality, 
B;onsistency a^id talent in their pieces
 guarantee it.
For fans of Abstract Expressionism, or
 hose who just like different, colorful
 vorks, Cunningham, a true experimenter 
In color and texture, has large, fantastic
 canvases such as La Fuente del Ritmo. 
V^iont just pass this one by, saying I
 ;ould do that, instead look at it long
 :nough to see the depth in the work, 
lind how the colors blend, and what Cunningham did to achieve such effects.
Also, on the abstract side are Ahlstroms
 erigraphed stripes. Again, it is necessary to
 study these to see the subtleties of color, 
tripe width, direction, etcetera. Soon one 
!|:an see how her patterns run out of the 
J'rame and across the wall, or, as in some 
ihases, into the room.
On a somewhat quieter perspective, 
Ahlstrom will be displaying her weaving 
and immaculate bookbinding. Shes cur
rently working on leather covers, but these, 
unfortunately, will not be ready for the 
show.
Cunninghams weavings are made using 
the Ikat method; the wool yam is first 
tie-dyed, then woven. The result is color 
and shades, warmth and comfort. Weaving 
is not the only thing the two have in 
common, they both do a bit of printing.
Cunningham has a series of reduction 
cuttings on a woodblock that trace the 
development of the final piece. She also 
is including her original rendering of 
the mode. Ahlstrom has a small intaligo 
print that is very attractive and unlike 
her other work in many ways. 
i*The theme of the show, as represented 
by the two bright hearts on their poster, 
is color and they have that and more. 
The show will be an interesting and un
usual Valentines Day Date.

Brigadoon brings a world of beauty and excitement toCMU
by Richard Gorelick
The department of Drama has taken 
what might seem to be a hopelessly dated 
and bland musical of the 1940s and trans
formed it into a beautiful and emotionally 
powerful production. Lerner and Loewes 
Brigadoon is from an era of American mu
sical theatre when the love of a man for a 
woman was the central issue to be resolved 
In the show, and through a series of boist
erous chorus numbers and heart-to-heart 
love ballads, the issue was invariabley re
solved. The heavy dramatic themes and 
shocking action and language of todays 
musicals are blissfully absent from Brig
adoon.
The goal of any modern production of 
Brigadoon is, therefore, to bring the auddience out of their media oriented and ja
ded intellects into a world of pure fantasy, 
so that they not only are entertained by 
what the performers on stage are doing, 
but are also convinced of their existence 
as real human beings. Carnegie-Mellons 
present production is overwhelmingly 
successful in achieving this goal.
The success of the production in bring
ing the audience into another world is 
never more obvious than in Karen Bab
cocks rendering dance solo in the second 
act. Without uttering a word, she brings 
the audience out of the musical mist into 
an almost cathartic .expression of basic 
human grief and sorrow. The audience is 
let known that Brigadoon, the village and 
the show, might be a cheerful little para
dise, but its citizen? still have their basic 
human problems. As evidence for the 
scenes success, the audience responded 
with respectful silence.
Brigadoon is, of course, the story of 
how two Americans who, while hunting 
in the Scottish Highlands, stumble upon 
the mysterious and beautiful village of 
Brigadoon, how one of the Americans,
Tommy Albright, falls in love with a 
village girl, Fiona, and how he is distressed 
to learn that she only wakes up once every 
hundred years. For real. Brigadoon had 
been magically blessecj (cursed), and when 
its villagers go to sleep at night they 
wake up a hundred years later. ( A scene 
comes to-mind: A Brigadoonian couple in 
bed. She says, Not this century> I have a 
headache.)
Tommy and Fiona, beautifully played 
by Gregg Kirsopp and Carol Burt, must 
deal with the problems of their age differ
ence, about 196 years, and the fact that 
Tommy has a fiancee waiting back in New 
York. They really dont have too much 
time to work out their problems, what 
with wedding plans for Fionas sister, 
Jean, and Charlie Darrymple (Susan 
Burkhimer and Richard Marchiso), and 
the general anxiety over Jeans embittered 
admirer (Wayne Meledandri).
While Kirsopp and Burt are two thor
oughly engaging performers, (their resound
ing duet of Its Almost Like Being in 
Love received the evenings loudest ap
plause), their part of the story is over
whelmed by rousing chorus numbers and 
fantastic dancing.
Myron Nadel has brilliantly choreo
graphed the show. The opening number and 
On my Mamas wedding day show true en
semble effort. A ballet sequence by the 
female ensemble featuring Burkhimer is 
breathtaking in its conveyance of womanly 
virtue and friendship, and Meledandris 
sword dance is another of many highlights.
Molly McCloskey and Frederic Tietz 
deliver superb comic performances as a 
horny village lassie, and Tommys Amer
ican friend, whom she is in hot pusuit of. 
They took a potentially hackneyed subplot 
and made the audience love it.
There are problems with Brigadoon, 
however, that no production, including
The stars of Brigadoon, Gregg Kirsopp and Carol
this one, can be expected to overcome, 
like terribly sexist scenes and jokes, and 
some simply awful lyrics by Lerner; 
Because they told me I cant behold ye, 
Looks like he fell on a rock and crushed 
his head (rhymes with dead), but the 
audience happily puts them aside, and con
tinues to enjoy the splendid production.
Christine Oagleys set was exceptional. 
Her forest succeeds in giving the stage a 
cathedral effect. Rebecca Goss has de
signed colorful and convincing costumes, 
and John Gilles did a commendable light
ing job. All of the elements of the pro
duction, under the direction of Gregory
Burt.
LeHane, were thoughtfully and beautifully 
integrated.
The orchestra played powerfully and was 
an important contribution to the plays 
dramatic impact, but unfortunately, they 
were playing from backstage, which re
sulted in a recorded effect.
Mr. Lundie, the town know-it-all, 
played with typical excellence by Hall 
Hunsinger, tells Fiona and Tommy that, 
If you love somone deeply enough, 
anythings possible, and in the spirit of 
of clapping hands for Tinkerbell, 
the audience cannot help but believe 
in Brigadoon.Illustrators display unique show at Gallery
by Alex Czajkowski
Art often reflects the artists attitudes 
towards his work, the worldv and life in 
general. The reflection inherent in the 
artists work can be called a materiali
zation of the artists philosophy. The^ 
works of Molnar and Kiley, two of the 
four illustrators who exhibited their work 
last week at the Forbes Street Gallery, are 
vivid examples of those whose work does 
show this materialization of 
philosophies. Utzig and Goetz do like
wise, but other aspects of their work are 
more dominant, such as consistency and 
development.
Molnar strives for color, graphic 
impact and movement in her endeavors. 
With this in mind, one can better under
stand her love of the recurring French 
Vogue model silhouette in Varia
tions, Another Variation, and Five 
Variations in Charcoal. The figures are 
very striking and attention getting, as a 
models pose must be. Sleeping Wizard 
and its test drawings also reflect her 
desire for graphic impact. On the other 
hand, color and movement are combined 
in Aout and Janviera young girl 
running into a lush, tropical forest and 
another French Vogue model in 
brightly colored, swirling peacock feathers, 
respectively.
Kiley believes that Art *is life and 
his figure drawings agree. Pose-perfect 
and detailed, not an artist at the opening 
didnt admire them. They were very life
like in their poses, one looked as if he was 
set to pounce off the wall on to some 
unsuspecting observer, another could have 
been sitting in the wall with his feet 
dangling into a Woodlawn Apartment.
The details of their backs and spines 
especially, created solely by careful 
shadings, were amazing.
Utzig uses many mediums for her work, 
best of which are her paintings on canvas. 
Rolling Feather, Pocket Watch. and 
Untitled, an abstract were all colorful, 
imaginative and thought provoking. 
Pocket Watch, a close-up of an open 
pocket watch on a big canvas was the first 
piece to catch my eye at the show. The 
untitled abstract was the favorite of many 
that I talked to, several saying it would 
look good in their room.
Goetz is a marvelous illustrator. You 
may have seen her Illustrators Show 
poster flosting around somewhere, not 
the four fatties, but the person rising a 
la Superbubble from a chessboard in 
space. Like Utzig, she excels on canvas 
with pieces like Animal Crackers and 
Family Portrait, the first being a
procession of animal crackers, the
second, three people with cubicized 
bodies. Her illustrations were colorful,
fun, and very telling, as illustrations ?need to be. That Tree Touched Me, 
Basketball Player and Untitled 
(a semi-surrealistic piece with cognitating apes) are all ready for publication in 
a childs book. Sports Illustrated, and 
either a science-fiction story, a psy
chology text or a biology book.
Each of the three other artists had 
illustrations as well; Louise Molnar with 
You Must Be Mad, said the Cat, Or You 
Wouldnt Be Here; Sue Utzig with 
Moms House, Nudibranch, and the 
phenomenal Fungi illustration. Mush
room lovers take note: the colors in
Fungi are so well blended that the over
all effect is such that you expect to be able 
to pick them. Bob Kiley has illustrations 
as well, most colorful was a grove of trees 
and grass in A little Night Music, and 
the attention to detail that appears in all 
of his work reappears in his grey prison 
door of Falcolner, in his silver Ra'diator and in the pencil drawing of Lush, 
a female alcoholic.
Then there was the rest of the work, 
lithos and photos. Again, creative photo
graphy; Kris Goetz used two pictures of a 
fire escape to make a curving, spiraling 
steel structure called Fire Escape, 
Utzig did similarly by arranging four

Gordon succeeds with Great Encounters of the jazz kind
by James Patterson
There are close encounters, and then 
there are Great Encounters. When you com
bine tenorman Dexter Gordon with some 
of the greatest musicians around you get a 
great encounter. If you love jazz or if you 
want an introduction to what that great 
music is about, buy this album\
When Gordon returned from self-imposed 
exile in Europe in 1976 he was met with a 
tremendous welcome of packed night clubs 
and critical acclaim. The story goes that he 
was so completely overwhelmed, he talked 
fellow tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin 
into also returning. The fantastic music
they have produced individually has been worth the wait, but their encounters
on this album are classics. In addition 
Gordon also has some memorable encoun
ters with the late vocalist Eddie Jefferson.
Gordons work with Griffin is a live set 
from a Gordon concert at Carnegie Music 
Hall. The way they play on Blues Up and 
Down and Cake Im surprised the place 
is still standing! When two greats like this 
get together they always manage to push 
each other beyond all limits.
Blues Up and Down was the anthem 
of two other tenor greats, Gene Ammons 
and Sonny Stitt. Gordon and Griffins perSymphony review:
Previn returns in triumph
by Timothy R. Levan
An orchestra invariably sounds better 
with its own conductor at the podium, 
rather then a guest conductor. Such is the 
case with the Pittsburgh Symphony and its 
music director, Andre Previn.
After a six-month sabbatical, Mr. Previn 
has returned to Pittsburgh, and has, in his 
first concert with the symphony, greatly 
improved its preciseness, accuracy and 
general sound.
The program opened with the Berlioz 
Overture to Beatrice et Benedict. The 
accuracy of ensemble sound was much 
greater than that of the past few months, 
with each section playing exactly together, 
and combining precisely with the other 
sections of the orchestra.
Mr. Previn seemed to have complete 
control over every musician. The peppy 
spirit of the overture and the difficulty 
of the work was handled exceptionally and 
was received very generously by the audi
ence.
Mozarts Symphony No. 39 in E-flat 
major, continued with the same accuracy 
the Berlioz. Although somewhat longer 
than other Mozart Symphonies (due to its
slow movements), it did not grow tiresome. 
For this work, the orchestra was diminished 
down to a size more in keeping with one 
of Mozarts time. The symphony conveyed 
an overall musical shape and properly 
accentuated the string and woodwind 
themes and motives.
Maurice Andre, trumpet soloist, closed 
the first half of the program with the 
rousing Haydn Trumpet Concerto in E-flat 
major.
The first movement was amazingly ac
curate and was further heightened by a 
marvelous cadenza. Movement two showed 
Andres great sensitivity for musical line, 
and his endless supply of breath.
The third movement brought the con
certo to s fitting climax with Andres added 
ornamentation and embellishments to the 
written music. Perhaps this was due to the 
lack of a written cadenza within the move
ment.
Strauss Till Eulenspiegel closed the 
program with appropriate pomp, again 
showing Mr. Previns complete control over 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
formance here is a beautiful tribute. They 
not only play this blues up and down 
but inside and out as well. Gordon bran
dishes his tremendous power while Griffin 
uses his speed; driving each other on to 
higher and higher improvisational heights, 
and as they trade solos their personalities 
merge into a frenzy of musical madness. 
Cake is a Spanish-flavored Gordon origi
nal that is more laid back than Blues but 
Gordon and Griffin still do a lot of hard 
bio win.
The late Eddie Jefferson is another jazz 
great with Pittsburgh roots. At the time of 
his death in 1978 he was just beginning tb 
get public notice. Jefferson was the origi
nator of his style of jazz singing in which 
the vocalist memorized the exact solos of 
the instrumentalist and adds lyrics that tell 
a story. Some of his best work is now 
available and includes versions of Miles
Davis So What and Coleman Hawkins 
classic Body and Soul. As a tribute to 
his contribution as a vocalist, The Manhat
tan Transfer has dedicated its latest album 
to his memory.
Gordon was able to record these tracks 
with Jefferson six months before his death 
in 1978. Diggin In is a Gordon original 
with lyrics by Eddie Jefferson. Its Only 
A Paper Moon is a tune that Jefferson re
corded several times and stems from a 
Lester Young solo. We should be grateful 
that Jeffersons work could be recorded on 
a major label with an artist of such wide re
cognition. Eddie Jefferson and Johnny 
Griffin represent the kind of class jazz mus
icians who have not succumbed to the al
mighty dollar. Dexter Gordon is not only 
a great musician but a great human being 
for helping to improve the popularity of 
these great but unrecognized jazz musicians.
Teddy P. overheats Stanley
by L. Vernon Valentine
The romantic themes and sensual over 
tones which characterize the music and 
style of Teddy Pendergrass have undoubt 
edly attracted thousands of women to his 
concerts across the country. Indeed, the 
earthy and soulfully voiced Pendergrass has 
held women only concerts in special 
acknowledgement of his large female fol
lowing. However, such was not the case at 
the^ Stanley Theatre last Saturday evening, 
February 2nd. Before a near-capacity 
crowd of males and females, Pendergrass 
proceeded to electrify and captivate the 
entire audience, giving a superb perfor
mance with selected cuts from his four 
solo albums: Life is a Song Worth Singing, 
Teddy Pendergrass, Teddy, and his latest, 
Teddy Live Coast to Coast.
Just as the impatient crowd seemed to 
reach its peak of restlessness, the house 
lights were cut and Marsha Warfield, Inter

immediately had the audience howling as 
she proceeded with her uniquely humorous 
and bawdy style. Not unlike Richard 
Pryor, she used sex as the main theme and 
focal point for her monologue. For a full 
forty-five minutes Warfield brashly 
quipped abouth everything from sexist 
television commercials to male/female re
lations. When she walked off stage, the 
audience was sufficiently prepared for the 
main attraction.
After a heightening of tension by a fur
ther fifteen minute delay, the stage lights 
went down, the Teddy Bear Orchestra

tempo of Only You, and out walked the

from Pendergrass, cries of Teddy were 
heard throughout the audience. Totally 
dominating the audience -and making full 
use of the entire stage, Teddy made all 
feel the hour and a half wait well worth 
it. After a few verses, he fell into instumental harmony with his band, displaying 
skills as a percussionist on the timbales.

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre presents varied program
by T. LeVan
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre opened 
its fourth production of the season with a 
varied program combining classical and 
modern ballet.
Les Sylphides, a one-act Romantic 
Reverie by Fokine (music by Chopin) 
opened the program with little excitement.
William DiGregory (of the Pennsylvania 
Ballet) danced for Miguel Campaneria, who 
was disabled during a rehearsal.
Patricia Davis, Mr. DiGregorys partner, 
danced with fine skill and a convincing 
portrayal of her role, but with a lack of 
vitality and enjoyment.
The ballet was not aided by the cast 
change, although we may have wished that 
Ms. Davis would have sustained the ballets
excitement. Unfortunately, her studied, 
accurate execution did not make up for 
the loss of Mr. Campeneria, but rather 
created a very straight-forward interpre
tation of little value.
Statements, a ballet set of Aaron Cop
lands Statements for Orchestra, revived 
our interest and presented us with a fresh, 
vibrant stretch of sheer enjoyment. Dash
ing costumes, innovative and somewhat 
modern choreography and an abundance 
of dancer vigor made Statements perhaps 
the best section of the entire program.
The Flower Festival pas de deux from 
Napoli followed with Francesca Corkle and 
Keith Martin. Both dancers were very 
accurate and well-prepared, but seemed 
to be simply rehearsing one more time.
Neither was truly respectful of the others 
solo dances; from time to time, one would 
cross his arms or shift weight to the other 
leg.
The audience was also distracting during 
this section in their pretentious knowledge, 
of what was difficult and deserving of fer
vent applause. An old woman, supposing 
herself to possess the knowledge of Martha 
Graham, was repeatedly heard uttering 
strains of mahvelous followed, of course, 
by a twitter of over-exuberant claps which 
inevitably led to mass applause.
Stravinskys Firebird provided an apt 
ending to the evenings program. The story 
was easily followable, choreography not 
trite, costumes not distracting, and music 
effortlessly supportive of the dancing. This

Weather Report on stage
by Dave Kirby
One of the biggest problems with fusion 
or jazz-rock is that most of it doesnt trans
late effectively on stage. Most fans were 
weaned in the rock tradition of high energy 
compacted into relatively short formats. 
Mainstream jazz audiences listen differ
ently, focusing their attention more on 
soloists and group interaction. live fusion 
often cannot bridge the middle ground.
This was the greatest flaw in the Weather 
Report show recently at the Stanley 
Theater. Keyboardist Josef Zawinul and 
sax player Wayne Shorter have, over the 
years, developed a truely unique approach 
to electronic jazz, yet, despite six or seven 
albums of varied compositions, most of 
the show was improvisations on somewhat 
uninspired phrases by Zawinyl, all of them 
developing and resolving in much the same
way. While there were brief glimpses of 
pieces like In a Silent Way, the bands 
only fully treated composition was the 
commercial hit, Birdland.
All in all, it was a rather disappointing 
evening. Its too bad that Weather Reports 
incredible talent and inventiveness, especi
ally as portrayed on their latest live LP, 
was shelved in lieu of twenty minute jams 
on simple four-bar phrasings. The band still 
has remarkable power and imagination, and 
they certainly deserve to continue into the 
eighties, but, as in most bands I suspect, 
they simply had an off night.
Im looking forward to seeing this band 
redeem themselves.

created, for the first time in the evening, a 
well-blended, fully congruous ballet.
The orchestra, with minor intonation 
and watch the conductor flaws, played 
very well. Firebird was played especially 
impressively and precisely, always with 
utmost support of and never dominance 
over the dancers.
Overall, the evening provided a program 
of ballet segments as varied in their quality 
as their origin.
Teddy!
continued from page 16
against the walls of the Stanley. During 
part two of the three part suite, Close the 
Door, Teddy, still belting out lines with 
feeling, walked to the edge of the stage 
and delivered kisses to several women 
awaiting with outstretched hands. Yet, 
crowd reaction was still to reach its peak. 
With the last of the sequential love ballads, 
Turn Off the lights, the Stanley rose to 
its feet, giving Pendergrass and his well 
deserving band a standing ovation.
The show ended in similiar fashion to 
the way it started, with the upbeat tempo 
of Shout and Scream, At about 11:15 
PM, an emotionally and physically drained 
audience and performer parted, apparently 
happy to be together for a fulfilling 
seventy-five minutes.
College students should be 
obscene and not heard.

When people talk about hot and cold 
teams, they must include this years version 
of the CMU Tartans. Yes, the Tartans are 
on another one of those streaks, fortun
ately this time, its a winning streak. The 
Tartans, who opened up the PAC-8 
campaign with three straight victories and 
followed up with four consecutive defeats, 
are now probably playing the best ball 
in the conference. They upped their winn
ing streak to three in a row last week by 
picking up two home victories over John 
Carroll and Case Western Reserve, the 
conferences two Cleveland based teams.
Last Wednesday, the Tartan hoopsters 
were pumped up expecting a barnburner 
with John Carroll who had just knocked 
off previously undefeated Bethany in their 
last outing. But it was not to be, as the 
Streaks made the three hour trip to the 
City of Champions only to take it on the 
chin by a score of 84-54.
The Tartans led the whole way, shutting 
down the Blue Streaks two leading scorers, 
John Cblombo and Jerry McCaffrey, 
holding them to ten points apiece.
It was Joe Belechak leading the pack 
for CMU. Joe pumped in 23 points while 
shooting an amazing 73% from the field.
The Blue Streaks, now 4-5 in PAC-8 
play, shat a frigid 30% from the field. 
They were also out-rebounded by a margin 
of 52-31.
Following Belechak in the scoring parade 
were Larry Hufnagel with 16 points and 
Buddy Hobart who had 13 points while 
hauling in 14 rebounds.
On Saturday, Case Western Reserve 
stepped in as the next victim as the Mad 
Plaid took revenge on the Spartans by a 
score of 76-60. The Tartans lost at Case 
earlier in the season on a shot at the buzzer 
which was the first loss in that four game 
losing streak.
It was Senior Parents Day as the 
parents of Mariano DeFilippo and Larry 
Hufnagel were both honored before the 
game. Huffy showed his parents homage by 
pouring in a season high 30 points, includ
ing his 1000th career point in a Tartan 
uniform. Larry needed eight points coming 
into the game to reach to 1000 plateau and 
he got his eight about six minutes into the 
contest. At that time the game was stopped 
and Huffy was recognized with a standing 
ovation.
For the second consecutive game Coach 
Dave Maloney was able to clear the bench 
with the Tartans being in command the 
entire way. DeFilippo played an excellent 
defensive game, keeping the loops second 
leading scorer, Ken Jackson, intact with 10 
points.
CMU led 37-27 at halftime. The 
Spartans were able to pull to within four 
early in the second half, but after a few 
quick hoops from Huffy, the Tartans
In the midst of a group of John Carroll defenders, leading scorer Larry Hufnagel (no. 14) pops a 
jumper. He reached the 1,000 point milestone against CWRU last Saturday.
Hufnagel breaks 1,000
had the lead for keeps. With two minutes 
remaining, Maloney sent the troops into 
the four corners. At that time Dan 
Donahoe put on a dribbling show which 
brought the crowd to their feet and also 
brought Danny phone calls from the 
Harlem Globetrotters (almost).
The Spartans, now 6-4 in conference 
play, were outshot by the Tartans 54% to 
37% from the field.
Joe Belechak followed Hufnagel with 13 
points and Buddy Hobart added 10 while 
playing an outstanding defensive game.
Tomorrow night CMU travels to 
Greenville, Pa. to face winless Thiel and 
then they travel to Meadville on Saturday 
for a thriller with the Allegheny Gators 
who are currently 8-2, one game behind 
Bethany.
Tartan Notes: The Tartans are now tied 
Tor third place in the conference with a 
64 mark while posting a 10-8 overall 
record... Dave Maloney stated, The 
reason for the turn around is an improved 
mental attitude. The team lacked confid
ence after losing by one at Case, then 
going to Bethany to get beat badly, and 
then playing a super game at home against 
Allegheny and still coming up empty 
handed. The win at Hiram is what we 
needed to get rolling and now were just 
playing super.... Tom Booths JV team 
defeated Boyce Community College last 
week boosting their record to 5-2... John 
Lewis entered the game for the first time 
in a week and a half on Saturday, coming 
off a severely sprained ankle... everyones 
favorite. Tartan Tom Clancy hit for two 
points in both games last week.
1000 points: Larry Hufnagel's 30 point performance against Case Western Reserve last Satur
day upped his career point total to 1,022. PAC scoring Champion and Most Valuable Player of a 
year ago, Hufnagel is again among the league's leading scorers and rebounders.

Tankers close Case, 65-48
by Laurie Southom and Randy Condon
In their last home meet of the season 
against the Spartans of Case Western, the 
Tartans won 65-48. Leading the tankers to 
victory were a trio of Phi Kaps: Mike 
Kochanowski, Tom Barr, and Jim Matysek. 
The trio captured three firsts a piece.
Kochanowski came from behind on the 
last length of the 200 yard freestyle, win
ning by a body length. He also won the 
100 yard freestyle and participated in the 
winning 400 yard medley relay. Barr
snared first in the 50 yard freestyle and 
200 yard breaststroke as well as contribu
ting to the 400 yard medley relay.
Another excellent performance was 
turned in by Bob Frye, as he captured first 
place in the required diving competition.
Captain Tom Gerlowski and Todd 
Reinke swam the last two legs of the 400 
freestyle relay to assure an impressive win 
for the Tartans. Coach Donna Jean Pecmans 
swimmers now boast a 6-3 record going in
to next weeks meet against arch rival W&J.

Frye qualifies for national diving competition
Bob Frye, a senior at Carnegie-Mellon 
University, has qualified for the diving 
competition of the NCAA Division III 
Swimming Championships at Washington & 
Jefferson College, March 20-22.
This is the second straight year Frye, a 
graduate of Central Catholic High School, 
will represent CMU at the championships. 
This year he earned the right by virtue of 
his 421.65 point performance in the onemeter dive during a recent CMU-Gettysburg meet, which the Tartans won, 63-50. 
Going into the meet, Frye needed 390 
points to qualify.
Fryes achievement, according to Tartan 
Coach Donna Pecman, is even more re
markable since it was doubtful whether 
he would even compete this year following 
an accident he suffered over the Christ
mas break. While attending a training 
session in Florida, Frye struck the board 
and was sidelined for two and a half weeks 
with an injured back and left leg.
Bobbys a tough competitor, Pecman 
said. And determination is his key attibute. He knows what he wants and he 
goes after it  and he really wanted to 
qualify for the nationals again.
Frye, a four-year letterman in swim
ming, is also a member of the Tartan 
varsity football squad which won the 
Lambert Bowl as the easts top small 
college team this season.
Hitchens takes coaching post at alma mater
Bob Hitchens, a former All-America 
who led the nation in rushing in 1972, 
has been named offensive backfield coach 
at the University of Miami of Ohio, joining 
the staff of third-year Head Coach Tom 
Reed.
It will be a coming home of sorts for 
Hitchens, who played at Miami from 
1971 to 1973, and is only one of two 
Redskins ever to have his jersey number 
retired. In all, he set nine rushing mile
stones for single game, season and career 
achievements; he led the nation in total 
yards with 1,390 as a junior: and he was 
named team most valuable player and 
Miami Athlete of the Year in 1972.
For his efforts, Hitchens, 27, will be 
inducted into the University of Miami 
Hall of Fame February 9 the youngest 
athlete to be so honored.
Hitchens signed with the Pittsburgh 
Steelers as a free agent after graduation, 
and later played with the Kansas City 
Chiefs and the New England Patriots. 
Most recently, he served as the offensive 
backfield coach for Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity (Pittsburgh, Pa.), a 1979 NCAA 
Division III semifinalist.
Hitchens, a native of Columbus, Ohio, 
has a Bachelor of Science degree in Health 
and Physical Education.
