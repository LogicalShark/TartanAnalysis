Handheld computers, virtual clusters 
provide new options for the classroom
Students in Professor David Yaron's 
using handheld computers like the 
things like take in-class quizzes.

News Editor
Computing Services and several 
professors on campus are increas
ing the presence and flexibility of 
computers in the classroom. 
Courses this semester are providing 
opportunities for students to use 
everything from virtual clusters to 
handheld devices.
There are two classes using the 
handheld devices this semester. 
One is Modern Chemistry II, which 
is taught by David Yaron, an associ
ate professor of Chemistry, and the 
other is Rapid Design and 
Prototyping of Computer Science, 
an interdisciplinary course taught 
by both Dan Siewiorek, a Buhl 
Professor of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering and 
Computer Science and the director 
of the Engineering Design Research 
Center, and Asim Smailagic, a 
research engineer for the Institute 
for Complex Engineered Systems.
Doug Blair, a project leader for 
Special Projects in Computing 
Services, said that the handheld 
devices are useful by themselves,
Modern Chemistry II class have been 
ones shown above all semester to do
but are much more convenient 
when connected to a network. The 
wireless Andrew network on cam
pus has allowed for this to happen. 
The real enabler was the wireless 
network. When that was enabled in 
enough places on campus we could 
start looking at these applications, 
said Blair.
Much of what were trying to 
learn from the class use is how 
wireless handheld devices and soft
ware are likely to be used by stu
dents, as well as identifying the 
areas where the platforms might 
fall short of the students needs, 
said Tracy Futhey, the vice provost 
for Computing Services. With this 
information, well be able to more 
effectively lobby and collaborate 
with the vendors who produce the 
hardware and software, with the 
goal of improving future versions of 
those products.
 Siewiorek said that his class is 
currently working to find new 
applications for the handheld 
devices. The use of the devices is 
also allowing Computing Services 
to test the efficiency of wireless 
Andrew and watch for resulting 
products from the class to see if
there are possibilities for future 
development of the applications. 
Siewioreks Rapid Design and 
Prototyping class consists of 30 stu
dents divided up into six different 
groups. The class is using the 
devices to work on projects such as 
locating a persons position on 
campus. A user is able to use the 
device to track a particular per
sons position as they move across 
campus if they also have a device. 
There is also an option on the 
device to control privacy issues, 
such as who can track you and to 
whom you would appear invisible. 
Other projects include checking 
the status of a printer and having a 
group whiteboard on each individ
uals handheld device. This means 
that when one person writes on his 
or her device, it would also appear 
on the other group members 
devices. This kind of project could 
lead to future collaboration with 
people from outside of CMU and 
even outside the country, said 
Siewiorek. We want to be able to 
extend the project to collaborate 
with students outside the area for 
example in Germany, said 
Siewiorek. We want to teach geo
graphically distributed courses.
The handheld computers have 
been helpful. In one psychology 
class, I have used my handheld 
computer to pull up Web pages 
during class relevant to the discus
sion. I could then contribute more 
to the class. This kind of turn 
around hasnt been possible 
before, said Joshua Anhalt, a 
senior in electrical and computer 
engineering and a student in 
Siewioreks class. He said that he 
has found some drawbacks to wire
less Andrew though. He said that 
the lack of connection in dorms 
and some academic buildings 
sometimes made things difficult.
There are also three classes using 
a virtual cluster in the GSIA build
ing, including Systems Analysis & 
Design, taught by Sandra 
Slaughter, an assistant professor in 
GSIA, and Web Engineering, taught 
by Nick Flor, also an assistant pro
fessor in GSIA.
The idea here was to start to 
push the bounds of our traditional 
idea of computer clusters. As an 
increasing number of students own 
computers, and laptops in particuSee COMPUTER, page 3
CERT Coordination Center wins top award for security
by Laine Towey
Assistant News Editor
SC Magazine, formerly Secure 
Computing Magazine, has named 
the Computing Emergency 
Response Team Coordination 
Center (CERT/CC) the best securi
ty idea or practice of 1999. The 
CERT/CC, which is located in the 
Software Engineering Institute, has 
been operating since 1988, when it 
made its first appearance in ground
breaking security research.
There are currently 90 CERT 
teams around the world, but CMUs 
center was the first after a worm 
program in 1988 caused an email 
shutdown and resulted in the crip
pling of 10 percent of the computers 
that were connected to the Internet 
around the United States. This led to 
the eventual creation of the 
CERT/CC, which was funded by the 
Department of Defense (DoD).
The alliance with the 
that
work with the Internet community 
to respond to computer security 
problems, raise awareness of com
puter security issues, and prevent 
security breaches. In the year 1999 
alone, the CERT/CC handled more 
than 8,500 separate incidents hav
ing to do with computer security. 
The fact that many of these inci
dents were relatively well-known 
has something to do with receiving 
the award, said Bill Poliak, the pub
lic relations coordinator for the 
Software Engineering Institute.
There were several high-profile 
incidents in 1999 that raised the 
CERT/CCs visibility. The Melissa 
virus, the ExploreZip worm, and the 
development of dangerous new 
tools for conducting denial-of-service attacks are three examples. I 
think that the security industry 
wanted to acknowledge the value of 
the CERT/CCs contributions, which 
have been particularly conspicuous 
in the past year, said Poliak.
annual awards banquet. The award 
was presented by the General 
Manager of Hewlett-Packard, 
Robert Vendrano. Hewlett-Packard 
is the general sponsor of the SC 
Magazine Awards, but there are 
many associate sponsors, such as 
Axent Technologies, Inc., Cisco 
Systems, Panda Software, and 
Symantec Corporation.
This category is designed to pro
mote better security awareness and 
encourage the dissemination of 
good security ideas and practices. 
Readers may nominate themselves, 
their organization or company, said 
the SC Magazine Web site. This cat
egory is not open to developers of 
security products or services. 
However, developers or vendors 
may be aware of and nominate a 
company ... who has demonstrated 
innovation in security.
Before presenting the award,

CMU Robotics Club takes 
first place in competition
by Megan Adriance
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics 
Club recently attended the Society 
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
Walking Machine Decathlon. Five 
Carnegie Mellon students compet
ed in the decathlon with their 
robot, Jim2000.
The team consisted of Aaron 
Solochek, a sophomore physics 
major, Peter Sand, a senior com
puter science major, Jonathan 
Hurst, a junior mechanical engi
neering major, and Kwanjee Ng 
and Brian Kirby, first-year students 
in electrical and computer engi
neering. They won first place out 
of 10 in the competition with 
14,000 points, finishing well above 
the other competitors including 
the second and third place finish
ers who had 6,000 and 5,800 
points respectively. They also got 
awards for Best Technical
Presentation, and for Excellence in 
Autonomy.
The Walking Machine Decathlon 
was held from April 27-29 at 
Colorado State University in Fort 
Collins, Colorado. The competi
tion is held yearly and is open to 
undergraduates in the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada.
The competition gives students 
the opportunity to design, build, 
and test a walking machine with a 
self-contained power source. The 
machines must then perform ten 
tasks during a competition that 
challenges competitors to think 
creatively. The events take place 
on an 11 square grid on the 
ground. This year some of the 
events included a sprint where the 
robots begin at one end of the 
course and race to the finish point 
and slalom race where the robot 
must weave between cones placed 
on the field. Another event was 
load retrieval where the robot

Civil Engineering students work to complete ampitheater
by Sriram Goilapalli
Science & Technology Editor
Would you like to give an impromptu play or watch 
productions on your way to class? This years senior 
civil engineering Design and Construction course is 
going to make this possible by building a new 
amphitheater on the Cut for their semester project.
The Sylvan Theatre in the late 1980s, located where 
Posner Hall is now, used to provide this environment. 
There was a brick wall with a archway portal and ter
raced grass where students went to watch their fellow 
classmates perform in informal plays and impromptu 
skits. It fell into a state of disrepair through the late 
1980s and early 90s and was roped off, according to 
Larry Cartwright, a senior lecturer and lab director in 
civil and environmental engineering. When the new 
Posner Hall was constructed, the Sylvan Theater was 
destroyed.
Cartwright and his class hope to recreate that the
ater with a new amphitheater between Doherty Hall 
and the Purnell Center.
Design and Construction is a senior civil engineer
ing course that has been taught by Cartwright for the 
past 13 years. Comprised of civil engineers, mechani
cal engineers, architects, and sculptors, students work 
together on a semester long project towards building 
something new on campus.
See PROJECT, page 3
Civil Engineering students in the senior level Design and Construction course are currently working 
to complete a new ampitheater between Doherty Hall and the Purnell Center. Each year students in 
the class work on projects that will contribute to the campus, such as adding seating near Doherty.

New Vietnam marks wars anniversary
u'HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam 
(AP)  From a garrison of sand
bags and barbed wire, a new 
Vietnam of high-rises and high-tech 
celebrates the 25th anniversary of 
the end of the war in a festival of 
song, speeches, fashion shows, and 
mass weddings.
" The song Uncle Ho Lives in the 
Great Victory Day was the theme 
for Sundays ceremonies across the 
. country. The final campaign that 
toppled U.S.-backed South
Vietnam on April 30, 1975, was 
called the Ho Chi Minh campaign 
and the old capital of Saigon was 
renamed in honor of the legendary 
Communist leader.
 On Saturday, Ho Chi Minh Citys 
Wide boulevards were bathed in a 
rainbow of the bright colors of 
Spring  red, blue, yellow, and 
purple. Trees, utility poles, and 
street corners were festooned with 
the flags of Vietnam and the 
Communist Party, and with plac
ards marked in large numbers 
30.4, April 30, the day Saigon 
died.
' And on television a Vietnamese 
performer sang Yesterday Once 
More, the old Carpenters song 
that was a sentimental favorite 
with lonely American GIs.
 Banners proclaiming the victory 
and a life-sized photo of Uncle Ho, 
who died in 1969, hung from what 
was then known as Independence 
Palace. Tanks 390 and 843 crashed 
through the gates and the commu
nists hoisted their flag at 11:30 am 
on that fateful day.
** Vietnam was reunified and the 
building was renamed 
Reunification Palace. Now a muse
um, it is the centerpiece for the cel
ebrations and a parade that will 
draw as many as 20,000 people.
 Across the street from the palace 
are some of the forgotten victims of 
the war  the South Vietnamese 
who fought alongside the 
Americans, now cast aside to the 
streets and ignored, languishing in 
poverty.
Nguyen Van Hien, 48, stands 
alongside his cyclo pedicabs await
ing passengers in what he hopes 
will be a profitable day  $10 in 
earnings.
, I dont care about the anniver
sary, says Hien, who was among 
the tens of thousands of South 
Vietnamese who deserted their 
ranks and fled in fear to be with
their families as the communists 
closed in. My priority is to earn a 
living to support my four children.
Scores of foreign tourists, includ
ing some U.S. veterans revisiting 
their battlefields, were in Vietnam.
Many Americans have wondered 
how the ragtag Viet Cong commu
nist guerrillas of the South and 
their North Vietnamese Army allies 
won the war against the Americans 
and their powerful weapons.
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai 
answered that question in a cere
mony Saturday in Hanoi, the capi
tal of reunified Vietnam, saying Ho 
Chi Minh inspired the communists 
to fight to the last man, a resolve 
that American officials could never 
understand.
His life and example have 
stirred up and fostered in each and 
every Vietnamese the will and 
resolve, We would rather sacrifice 
all than lose the country and 
become enslaved, and Nothing is 
more precious than independence 
and freedom. 
All sides sacrificed heavily: 
58,000 Americans dead, along with 
1.1 million communist fighters, 
223,748 South Vietnamese soldiers 
and nearly 2 million civilians, 
according to official Vietnamese 
reports.
Some U.S. veterans acknowl
edged the heavy price the commu
nists paid. My hats off to these 
guys that are here, said Ray . 
Winters, a 52-year-old Marine vet
eran from Chatsworth, California, 
visiting the Truong Son National 
Cemetery in the bloody Quang Tri 
province.
Americas direct military inter
vention in Vietnam ended on Jan. 
27, 1973, when Washington and 
Hanoi signed the Paris Peace 
Agreement. While it brought an 
end to Americas longest and most 
divisive war, the fighting never 
stopped for the Vietnamese.
In March 1975, the U.S. House of 
Representatives rejected President 
Gerald Fords $300 million supple
mentary military aid bill for South 
Vietnam.
The collapse of South Vietnam 
began at about the same time with 
a communist strategy that forced 
the Souths President Nguyen Van 
Thieu into tactical errors.
The communists launched a sur
prise attack on the little-known 
central highlands provincial capital
of Buon Ma Thuot, the southern 
anchor of South Vietnams defens
es.
Up against a larger, betterequipped foe and facing the cutoff 
of U.S. military aid, Thieu ordered 
his forces to abandon the sparsely 
populated highlands and withdraw 
to what he believed to be the more 
easily defended coast.
The retreat set off a wave of 
panic. North Vietnamese forces 
routed Saigon troops from north to 
south, from the central highlands 
to the coastal lowlands, with little 
opposition. In many cases, the 
South Vietnamese fled two to three 
days before the advancing commu
nist troops arrived.
Thieu fled the country on April 
21. He said in a bitter, tearful 
farewell address that the United 
States had broken a pledge to inter
vene if North Vietnam violated the 
Paris Agreement and had led the 
South Vietnamese people to 
death.
That sentiment was expressed by 
mobs of angry South Vietnamese 
citizens who felt betrayed and 
abandoned when the last remain
ing Americans at the U.S. Embassy 
pulled out in a chaotic evacuation 
after a three-hour, pre-dawn 
artillery attack on Tan Son Nhut Air 
Base.
They fired their rifles in the air, 
yelling, We want to go, too. 
Guards at the bases main gate tried 
to block the last convoy of 
American buses headed for another 
helicopter evacuation site. They 
backed off after the U.S. comman
der threatened to attack with gunships flying overhead.
That scene came to symbolize the 
wars futility. The old embassy is 
but a memory now, blasted into a 
vacant lot by a demolition crew two 
years ago. But its white walls 
remain, a reminder of the chaotic 
pullout that remains a vivid memo
ry for many Americans.
Times have changed though. 
Along with the new high-rise hotels 
in Ho Chi Minh City, a new U.S. 
consular office sits next to the old 
embassy site. There are still long 
lines of Vietnamese there.
But today they wait patiently in 
the quiet early morning for inter
views in hopes of getting resettle
ment visas to the United States.
It seems the two countries are 
forever intertwined.

Hate crimes stun 
Pittsburgh
MOUNT LEBANON, Pa. (AP)  
Authorities are trying to explain 
what may have motivated Richard 
Baumhammers, a 34-year-old immi
gration lawyer to allegedly go on a 
shooting spree that left five people 
dead Friday.
Five people died in the attacks: a 
Jewish woman who lived next door 
to Baumhammers, an Indian man at 
a grocery, two Asian men in a 
Chinese restaurant, and a black man 
at a karate school. Shots were also 
fired through the doors of two syna
gogues, and a man of Indian descent 
at the grocery was wounded.
Anybody who wants to guess 
whether it would be a hate-related 
crime, I guess these would be people 
who would look at the Empire State 
Building to determine if it was a sky
scraper, county coroner Cyril
Wecht said Saturday.
Police believe Friday afternoons 
violence began in the quiet suburb 
of Mount Lebanon, just south of 
Pittsburgh, where Baumhammers 
lived with his parents, both Latvian 
immigrants.
Police say Baumhammers appar
ently walked next door and fatally 
shot Nicki Gordon, 63, who was 
Jewish.
A flurry of reports of shootings 
came in minutes later:
Shots were fired at two syna
gogues.
Two men were shot at an Indian 
grocery store in Carnegie  Anil 
Thakur, 31, was killed, and Sandip 
Patel, 25, remained hospitalized in 
critical condition Saturday.
Two employees at a Chinese 
restaurant  Thao Pham, 30, a 
deliveryman from Vietnam, and JiYe Sun, 34, the Chinese manager  
were shot and killed in McKees
Rocks.
A black man  Garry Lee, 22  
was shot and killed at a karate 
school in a Monaca shopping plaza, 
about 20 miles from the first attack.
Police believe Baumhammers 
drove calmly to each location, 
stepped out of a dark sport utility 
vehicle, and fired.
He surrendered Friday afternoon 
when police spotted his sport utility 
vehicle and cornered him in 
Ambridge about 3 1/2 hours after 
Gordons body was discovered.
Police said officers who arrested 
Baumhammers also found an object 
in his vehicle that they plan to turn 
over to arson investigators. They 
would not describe it.
Baumhammers was arraigned on 
a charge of homicide and reckless 
endangerment and remained jailed 
Saturday. The FBI has joined the 
investigation to determine if federal 
hate crimes were committed.
World News
Detained U.S. 
journalist heads 
home
WASHINGTON (AP)  Tucker 
Carlson, a magazine reporter and 
television commentator who was 
detained briefly in Vietnam, flew to 
Singapore on Saturday and was 
expected back home Sunday, his 
wife said.
Susie Carlson said he was flying to 
Tokyo later Saturday and then on to 
the United States.
She said she and her husband 
were able to talk by telephone at will 
during his stay in Vietnam and that 
he was none the worse for the wear 
of the experience. She added that 
she did not ask about the circum
stances that led to his release when 
she talked to him Saturday.
Carlson, 30, went to Vietnam with 
John McCain for the 25th anniver
sary of the end of the Vietnam War.
He is a reporter for The Weekly 
Standard, a conservative magazine, 
and occasionally a TV political com
mentator.
After spending days touring 
Vietnam, and even seeing McCains 
old Hanoi Hilton prison cell, 
Carlson was trying to board a plane 
Friday when he found he wasnt free 
to leave.
Their explanation was I didnt 
have a stamp on my passport, 
Carlson told associates from his 
hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. 
Therefore I was not officially in 
Vietnam. Therefore I couldnt leave 
the country I wasnt in in the first 
place.
When he first tried to leave, along 
with McCain and members of the 
press, he learned that he hadnt
received a passport stamp when he 
arrived.
Immigration authorities took his 
passport and refused to let him 
board his departing plane. They first 
insisted that he travel to Hanoi to get 
the entry stamp. Then they wanted 
him to sign a statement admitting he 
wasnt supposed to be in the coun
try.
They tried to get me to sign it and 
I wouldnt and they freaked out and 
started yelling, he said.
The State Department was enlist
ed to help secure his departure.
Kosovo 
resolution 
renewal urged
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  
Diplomats said Saturday they would 
recommend that the U.N. Security 
Council renew a resolution govern
ing Kosovo when plans for the 
provinces future come under review 
in June.
Anwarul Chowdhury of 
Bangladesh, the head of a mission of 
eight diplomats who wrapped up a 
visit to Kosovo on Saturday, said the 
U.N. mission was doing good 
work.
It needs our backing in the 
Security Council, he said. No use
ful purpose will be served by adapt
ing or changing the resolution gov
erning Kosovo.
Chowdhurys remarks came on 
the same day that French peace
keepers clashed with rioting Serbs 
in the ethnically divided city of 
Kosovska Mitrovica.
The Security Council resolution 
governing Kosovo was adopted last 
year after NATO launched a 78-day
air attack to halt Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevics oppression of 
ethnic Albanians.
The resolution established a 
peacekeeping operation, but said 
only that the goal was to establish 
substantial autonomy and self-government pending a final settle
ment of the province's status.
For Albanians, who make up more 
than 90 percent of Kosovos people, 
the only acceptable final status is 
independence. Serbs still see their 
future as part of Yugoslavia.
The top U.N. representative in 
Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, has 
asked the Security Council to set 
clear goals.
In another reminder of the fragile 
nature of peace in Kosovo, French 
peacekeepers clashed with hun
dreds of Serbs on Saturday in a sub
urb of Kosovska Mitrovica, touching 
off a melee that destroyed one U.N. 
police car and damaged 17 other 
U.N. vehicles.
The riot began after peacekeepers 
brought about 80 ethnic Albanians 
to the predominantly Serb, northern 
part of the town to visit the homes 
they had fled last year. A standoff 
developed between the two groups, 
after the Serbs claimed that some of 
the Albanians were not former resi
dents.
We sent some soldiers to keep 
the situation quiet, said Lieutenant 
Mathieu Mabin, a spokesman for 
French forces.
Clashes started after the new 
troops moved in.
By late evening Saturday, the 
French peacekeepers were seen 
regrouping while much of the Serb 
crowd dispersed. Tensions remained 
extremely high, however, with a 
potential for more violence 
overnight.

CERT receives high scores 
for security procedures
Handheld devices, virtual cluster offer flexibility
CERT, from page 1 
essential in any security situation is 
intelligence  and what I mean by 
that is an intelligence agency. 
Someone who will give you infor
mation on the threats that are out 
there and the vulnerabilities you 
face. [The CERT/CC] provides valu
able security information free to 
anyone. It is a beacon to the rest of 
the information security world. 
According to Poliak, the history of 
CERT/CC also plays a major role in 
distinguishing it from other security 
practices. I think what differenti
ates [it] is its long experience in the 
field of network security. It has been 
in operation since 1988, long before 
computer emergencies were making 
headline news.
In responding to incidents, iden
tifying vulnerabilities in systems, 
and providing reliable information 
for the benefit of the rapidly grow
ing number of people who use the 
Internet, the staff at the CERT/CC
has earned a reputation for trust
worthiness in a field in which confi
dentiality, discretion, and reliability 
are essential to success, said Poliak.
People from all over the world 
access CERT/CCs Web site to learn 
the latest news about possible soft
ware security problems, as well as 
vulnerability issues and advisories.
Students seem to feel that these 
efforts are needed. Hacking and 
viruses have been a problem for a 
long time, it is nothing new, said 
Luis Cota, a sophomore computer 
science major. I think that viruses 
have become a major problem and 
its good that someone is actively 
working to stop it, said Jeff Easter, 
a sophomore in industrial design.
The publicity surrounding the 
award from SC Magazine can only 
help CERT/CC, said Poliak. SC 
Magazine is well known and widely 
read, so I think that this award will 
contribute to CERT/CCs already 
excellent reputation.

CMU forms 
new CMISS 
institute
The establishment of the Carnegie 
Mellon Information Survivable 
Systems (CMISS) in the Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI) has been 
announced. It is a research institute 
that is dedicated to fighting comput
er attacks. According to the CMISS 
officers, this establishment will con
centrate on prevention rather than 
. response. While many other com
puter emergency teams come., in 
after the computer attack occurs, 
the new, institute is geared to pre
venting network problems before 
they come and spread;
The new research center will seek 
partnerships and fee-for-service 
arrangements from public and pri
vate sectors and will obtain person
nel and resources from other CMU 
facilities. Unlike many other com
puter security networks, CMISS is 
asking for private as well, as federal 
funds, but, according to Bill Pollack, 
spokesman for the Software 
Engineering Institute,; the federal 
government has set strict limits on 
private investment in this research 
institute. Theres a limit on growth 
because of that. CMISS enables the 
Carnegie Mellon community to get 
all kinds of funding, Pollack said.
CMISS plans to obtain resources 
from the CERT Coordination Center. 
Unlike the CERT center, though, 
CMISS will not have restrictive lim
its on corporate money.
According to Pollack, CMISS 
hopes eventually to have an annual 
operating budget of $40 million, 
largely funded by the private sector. 
Rich Pethia, director of .SEI's
Networked Systems of Survivability 
Program, will be acting as interim 
director of CMISS. CMISS will 
include many Carnegie Mellon orga
nizations, schools, and institutes, 
including the Carnegie Mellon 
Research Institute (CMRI), College 
of Engineering, Heinz School, 
School of Computer Science, SEI, 
CERT/CC, and Technology Transfer 
Office.
Rec room 
conversion 
plans proceed
Tim Michael, the Director of 
Housing Services, sent an update to 
students last week regarding the 
Morewood rec room conversion to 
an expansion of the daycare center 
also located in Morewood.
Lots of residents and staff have 
provided opinions on the best solu
tion, and a consensus seems to be 
forming about a plan, said Michael 
in the email.
A proposal has been made to 
remove the wall between the cur
rent TV room and Reading Room to 
create a large rec room on the first 
floor. The possibility of removing 
the entrance walls to these two 
spaces and incorporating the hall
way into this new room was also dis
cussed. The space would have recre
ation equipment and vending.
Soundproofing will be added in 
the ceiling and on the wall next to 
the computer cluster.
It is a possibility that rooms 1D1 
and 1D2 arid the current D Tower 
lounge will be combined to make a 
new TV room for all residents.

COMPUTERS, from page 1 
lar, it becomes more interesting to 
think about how we might support 
the style of work that occurs in 
teaching clusters in traditional 
classrooms, said Futhey. In eory this seems straightforward, but 
in practice there are a whole lot of 
logistics that need to be resolved, as 
well as the simple fact that we cant 
take for granted that 100 percent of 
students have computers, let alone 
laptops, let alone laptops with the 
OS/software the course is using. 
Meena Lakhavani, the Director of 
User Services for Computing 
Services, agreed that one couldnt 
expect all students to have the 
appropriate laptop for class, but 
also that the already existing clus
ters on campus were getting too 
crowded and in-demand to make 
constant reservations. It was time 
to think a little more out-of-thebox. We couldnt find space for pro
fessors to teach in the clusters and 
we needed more flexibility, so we 
piloted the virtual cluster, said 
Lakhavani. The cluster was made
for the business program. There are 
a lot of classes in Simon Auditorium 
so we put it there.
There are currently 30 laptops 
and they can be checked out by stu
dents for one class period. Students 
simply check out the computer, 
take it into Simon Auditorium, and 
use the wireless network to obtain 
Internet capabilites.
Overall, I think the experience 
was quite positive. The students 
used the laptops for in-class exer
cises, which is an effective way for 
them to get practice while we are 
there to provide immediate feed
back, said Slaughter. An example 
of how we used the laptops is that 
we combined ... classes for one 
evening and divided students into 
teams. Each team had a laptop that 
they could use in helping them to 
solve different problems, such as 
database problems.
According to Slaughter, the nega
tives were fairly minor. At first stu
dents had difficulties logging into 
the network due to bandwidth con
straints, but those problems were

CivE class project brings 
ampitheater to campus
PROJECT,,from page 1 
Students heard about the pro
ject on the first day of class this 
spring, and were immersed in the 
project from the start. The first 
day of class [Cartwright] said we 
are going to be making a 
amphitheater, said Kendra 
Grompone, a senior civil engineer
ing major in the class. We had to 
find out what the [drama depart
ment] wanted, and find out 
details such as size, dimensions, 
locations, etc.
There will be seating for about 
20 people, and there will be a wall 
behind the stage. It is scheduled to 
be completed by May 22.
We all absolutely love it, said 
Grompone. It is set up to be a 
small scale construction project.
You are exposed to every aspect 
and every phase of a construction ; 
project, from the designs to the 
problems right on site. Everything 
going on in a matter of three 
months, you have to learn how to 
deal with everybody, ... learning 
things in the workshop, and actu
ally building the structural forms.
This is the first project funded 
only by class donations. The class
es of 1988,1990, and 1991 all con
tributed gifts towards this years 
construction of an amphitheater, 
sculptures, and more seating.
Previous projects for the class 
include the seating areas next to 
Doherty Hall, Porter Hall, and 
Scaife Hall, the garden area 
behind CFA, and the stairs leading 
towards the back of Doherty Hall.
resolved quickly. Also, it took a few 
times before we all got down the 
routine of checking the laptops in 
and out. She also said there were a 
few problems with students brows
ing the Internet or checking email 
during class. Fernando Matho, a 
sophomore electrical and computer 
engineering major, agreed. I think 
it is good to have the computers in 
class, but they might become a dis
traction.
Futhey said that they had expect
ed some of these difficulties. 
Through the virtual cluster pro
ject, we expect to resolve some of 
the logistic hurdles related to a lap
top checkout program, as well as to 
identify remaining outstanding 
issues so that we can evaluate 
whether this experimental pro
gram is a good candidate for an 
ongoing production service, she 
said.
A request has been put in, 
though, to raise the number to 50 
laptops for next year. Slaughter 
said that with an increase in the 
number of laptops available she
would like to be even more aggres
sive in her use of them in class. She 
suggested giving exams on them.
Lakhavani said that it would be 
difficult to make the service cam
pus-wide, though, because of the 
limited number of computers and 
the manpower needed for th? 
check-out areas. Another problem 
is the short amount of tim, 
between classes makes it difficult to 
have students check the computers 
in and then check them out to other 
students in the allotted time.
Its important to note that what 
were doing in both cases is very 
experimental. Neither is a produc
tion service in the same way as we 
provide our regular, ongoing ser
vices like the traditional clusters o^ 
the mail system, said Futhey. In 
both cases, we saw opportunities to 
try some things that were outside 
of our regular way of supporting 
classes, and we sought to give those 
things a try, even recognizing from 
the start that what we might learn 
... it was not a viable candidate foj 
a production service. ^
Crime and Incident 
Report
4/28 ASSAULT, 12:17 AM 
Upon receiving a call that a CMU 
female was assaulted outside the 
Panther Hollow Inn, Campus Police 
reported to the scene and talked 
with the victim. She stated that she 
was assaulted by two males. She 
had left the Subway on Craig Street, 
and was on her way back to campus 
when two males standing in front of 
the Panther Hollow Inn verbally 
confronted her. She ignored them, 
and continued walking, but the two 
males began to follow her. One male 
grabbed for her arm, but she pulled 
away. The two men began to grab 
for her bag and her hair, and one 
grabbed her left arm and began to 
squeeze tightly. The victim turned, 
kicked the male, and ran up Forbes 
Avenue. Campus Police are still 
searching for the suspects.
4/29 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 1:56 AM  Campus police 
received a call from the victim, who 
stated that he and several of his 
friends had been struck by a bever
age thrown from a moving car. The 
five victims stated that a passenger 
of a tan Volvo had tossed a cup of 
grape soda on them while they were 
crossing 5th and Morewood. The 
vehicle then struck a curb, and 
headed into the fraternities. 
Campus Police located the Volvo 
and the driver, who was not a CMU 
student. The driver helped to locate 
the passenger, who was then issued 
a citation for Disorderly Conduct.
4/29 SIMPLE TRESPASS, 
3:07 AM  Campus Police 
responded to Morewood Gardens 
for a suspicious person report. The
RA on duty, who stated that she was 
working at her computer when an 
unidentified male walked into her 
room and asked if he could get into 
an adjoining room from her room. 
The RA said no and then asked him 
why. The male stated that he was 
invited to a party in that room, but 
that he couldnt get in. The male 
then left and started banging and 
kicking the door of the other room. 
The RA went to talk to the resident 
of the room. Upon her arrival the 
male was let into the room, but the 
rooms resident wouldnt talk to her. 
Later the actor went into the RA^s 
room and apologized. He told her 
his name and that he was not a CMU 
student. He said there were two 
males and a female.inside the room 
and that they were having an orgy. 
He then left. Campus Police checked 
the area for the actor with negative 
results. A

Robotics Club captures first 
place in machine decathlon
and possible applications for the 
Walking Machine beyond the com
petition.
The Robotics Club provides the 
workspace, tools, advice, and fund
ing for students to design and work 
on their projects, without faculty 
direction. They attend several com
petitions similar to the decathlon 
each year.
The project is almost 100 percent 
undergraduate designed  faculty 
and grad students have only provid
ed advice on occasion, said Kelly 
Watson, a junior biology student 
and Robotics Club member.
The Walking Machine Decathlon, 
now in its 14th year, allows engi
neering students to gain hands on 
experience by designing, building, 
and testing their ideas against other 
students.
Carnegie Mellon has not placed in 
the top three since 1996. The 
Robotics Club has had two other 
entries in the past  Sidewinder 
and Moose.
ROBOTICS, from page 1 
must carry as much weight as possi
ble across the course.
Jim2000 was able to complete 8 
out of 10 of the events. We had the 
fastest time for all that were com
pleted. Our robot also managed to 
complete all of the competitions 
events autonomously, said Hurst.
The Robotics Club has been work
ing on Jim2000 for the past two 
years. It is a double-frame walking 
machine, designed to be fast. Many 
of the machines that compete in the 
decathlon are just single-frame 
machines, meaning they move by 
picking themselves up and moving 
forward in jerks. By using two 
frames, the team hoped to create a 
steady'movement, where the two 
frames are accelerating and deceler
ating, but the main body remains in 
constant motion.
Participants of the decathlon are 
judged on their statement of the 
objectives, description of design 
approach, application of sensors,

Thistles and Thorns
In this issue of The Tartan, we pre
sent Thistles and Thorns, a look at 
the highlights and low points of the 
academic year. A Thistle goes out to 
those things that deserve to be recog
nized for being good. A Thorn goes to 
those that we would have been better 
off without.
A Thistle to the opening of the 
Purnell Center for the Arts. Drama 
students can now claim a beautiful, 
world-class facility to match the 
departments reputation.
A Thorn to the excessive commer
cialism that has invaded the campus. 
The campus has seen everything from 
corporations painting the fence to 
invading advertising campaigns from 
online textbook companies. Students 
do not need to see advertisements 
screaming from every available blank 
space around CMU.
On that same note, a Thorn to fence 
abusers. In addition to Trilogys mis
use of it, some organizations covered 
neighboring trees with paint and 
another group impersonated Alpha 
Phi Omega. Those who took the fence 
this year at times pitifully abused the 
privilege.
A Thistle to Cindi Dennis, who put 
CMU on the map yet again by earning 
a Rhodes Scholarship.
A Thorn to the increases in tuition, 
housing, and the student activities 
fee; we hope that this annual tradition 
will soon end.
A Thistle to the SDC Food 
Committee, who expanded the Dine 
XPress program to include the O in 
Oakland, the Subway on Craig 
Street, and the Eat n Park in 
Squirrel Hill, all popular CMU stu
dent dining choices.
Another Thistle to the quality of 
campus food in general, which has 
increased considerably since the man
agement of Dining Services has been 
taken over by Parkhurst Corporation. 
Since then, the quality and choices 
have increased.
A Thorn to Student Senate for 
attempting to give certain govern
ment officials free parking, as well as 
doing a poor job of advertising this 
years elections, where only five per
cent of students turned out to vote. A 
Thorn also to the Joint Funding 
Committee of Student Government 
and the Student Body Treasurer for 
poor communication with student 
organizations regarding the budget 
process and lateness in finalizing 
financial allocations.
A Thistle to Computing Services for 
maintaining and expanding the 
Wireless Andrew network, a move 
which brought CMU to the forefront 
of the newly emerging world of wire
less internet access. As a result, 
Yahoo! Internet Life has ranked CMU
the most wired university in the coun
try. Computing Services also deserves 
another Thistle for increasing the filesize quota that students can keep in 
their Andrew accounts.
A Thistle to the trees that have been 
planted on the Cut. They add to the 
aesthetic quality of the campus and 
are long overdue.
A Thistle to the Campus Master 
Plan, which when finalized will bring 
exciting changes to the campus. 
Another Thistle for the Planning 
Committee, for doing everything 
they can to include students in the 
process, using Internet surveys and 
town meetings.
A Thorn to the Skibo renovations, 
which at first were exciting, but soon 
became almost comical with students 
drinking their coffee in a room with 
awful tropical colored walls and a spi
ral staircase to nowhere.
A Thistle to the new Newell-Simon 
Hall, which is quickly becoming a pop
ular place to meet friends and eat 
lunch.
A Thistle to the new email kiosks in 
Baker Hall. The convenience of check
ing email between classes is definitely 
a benefit.
A Thorn to the Activities Board con
certs and comedy. This year has seen a 
definite lack of good acts coming to 
the campus.
A Thistle to Wonder Boys for putting 
CMU in the spotlight, but a Thorn for 
making the showings so limited, at 
times forcing students to camp out for 
tickets, especially after so much dis
ruption was caused on campus by the 
filming.
A Thom to Enrollment Services and 
the directors of the University Center for 
not doing anything about the huge 
empty space in the basement of the UC.
A Thistle to Channel 16, the hous
ing and SDC movie channel. It offers 
a superior selection of both new and 
old movies that almost all students 
enjoy.
A Thorn to the Cyert Center for 
Early Education for taking over the 
Morewood Recreation Room, a popu
lar place for many Morewood resi
dents, without consulting with stu
dents beforehand.
A Thistle, though, to the Morewood 
Gardens renovation, which will change 
for the better some well-deserving 
rooms, especially in A-Tower.
Finally, a Thistle to the myriad 
accomplishments of Paul Christiano 
and Peter Steams, two men who have 
left a positive mark at Carnegie Mellon.
Beth Powell, a member of the editori
al board, disagrees on the point of the 
sceenings of Wonder Boys as a thorn.

Letters to the Editor
Student supports abortion
Editor:
To students, faculty, and adminstration 
of Carnegie Mellon University:
The members of Carnegie Mellon 
Rotaract would like to apologize for the 
recent email flash campaign we conducted. 
We realize in hindsight that this act was 
completely irresponsible and we are ready 
to and have faced the consequences.
As a punishment for our actions, we offer 
to do volunteer work for any and. all of the 
organizations affected by our actions. We 
would like to emphasize that no single per
son was wholly responsible for what tran
spired and that everyone in our organiza
tion understands that compiling a list of 
the entire campus to communicate an 
advertisement for a beneficial event is no 
justification for putting a large load on our 
campuss network. We sincerely regret any 
problems or inconveniences that this has 
caused.
We would also like to state that Richard 
Chen was not responsible for the email dis
tribution, although his name appeared as 
the sender.

Club apologises for spam
Editor:
I would like to respond to Thaddeus 
Billmans article in the issue of The Tartan 
two weeks ago. You know, the article in 
which he equated abortion with murder. I 
was hoping that Id never have to do this, 
but he forced my hand. My intent is noth
ing less than to show that the people who 
are against abortion are hypocritical terror
ists who want to usurp the freedoms that 
our founding fathers heroically fought and 
died for just to prove to the world that 
their views are the only correct views.
Firstly, there is the matter of showing 
how pro-lifers are hypocritical. The path 
through this proof is clear. Thats where 
George Carlins views on abortion come in. 
All you have to do is listen to the first two 
tracks of the Back in Town CD, or watch the 
first 10 or so minutes on the Back in Town 
comedy special where he discusses abor
tion, assuming that you are open-minded 
enough to do so.
Now let me ask this question of all you
pro-life conservatives: what about the 
rights of those who are already born? Ive 
noticed that most of these anti-abortion 
people are also members of the Christian 
right  a faction trying to impose its 
morals (and religion, for that matter) onto 
everyone else, which is a violation of sepa
ration of church and state. And besides, 
women who have abortions are exercising 
freedom of choice. Sure, it may not be the 
wisest choice that they could make, but its 
their choice to make, not yours.
And how do you justify the doctors who 
are killed or the abortion clinics that are 
bombed by terrorist pro-lifers? Yes, you 
read that correctiy. Terrorists. Just go to 
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyN 
ews/abortionterrorism.html to read up on 
the history of abortion-related terrorism. 
These crypto-fascist anti-abortion people 
remind me of one person in particular  
Osama bin Laden.
I could go on about this issue for hours, 
but I promised Id be brief.

Editorial must utilize facts
Editor:
In his editorial, Thaddeus Billman stat
ed: The fact that human life begins at con
ception is a scientific one. I would chal
lenge him to cite a single peer-reviewed sci
entific journal that supports this claim.
Further, I would suggest he be sure he 
understands the difference between scien
tific fact and opinion when giving such a 
citation.
He further states: 20-30 women die 
direcdy of legal abortions in the United 
States and several hundred more die of side 
effects. According to the Center for 
Disease Control (CDC), in 1992 (the last 
year for which confirmed data is available) 
only 10 women died as a result of compli
cations from legally induced abortions.
Further they state that in 1992, there 
were 0.7 abortion-related deaths per
100,000 legally induced abortions. 
http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/drh/surv_ab 
ort96.htm:
Additionally, from the CDC 
http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00054602.htm: During 
1982-1996, the annual maternal mortality 
ratio fluctuated between approximately 7
Justin Suissa/Art Editor
and 8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live 
births. So based on mortality rates, abor
tions are safer than pregnancies. I do note 
that one should also consider risk of severe 
injury as well. Unfortunately, such data 
isnt readily available.
However, the debate about whether an 
embryo or fetus is a distinct human being 
is a philosophical question, not a scientific 
one. Scientific inquiry involves the study of 
nature. Scientists make observations, 
develop theories and experiments to test 
those theories about how things work. If I 
were to take a corpse and hook it up to 
machines that sent electrical signals 
through the brain, caused the heart and 
lungs to function, would that then be a liv
ing human being? The scientific view 
would be to simply observe how the body 
functions compared to other known living 
human beings. It is the philosophical 
inquiry that would truly be involved in 
assessing whether an animated corpse is 
alive or simply a caricature of life.
If you prevent pregnant women from 
having abortions because you believe the 
embryo or fetus is a distinct human being, 
then what other restrictions would you put 
on pregnant women to protect the fetus? 
Will you also prevent pregnant women 
from smoking or drinking alcohol? Taking 
pain relievers?
Your basic premise is that the pregnant 
woman loses her rights because her deci
sion to abort causes the death of another 
human being. But does that mean people 
can also be forced to donate kidneys or 
blood because someone will die if they do 
not? Again these are philosophical issues, 
not scientific ones.
The authors statement there is no evi
dence to suggest having an abortion lessens 
the rape victims pain or trauma in any 
way says more about how hard he actually 
looked for evidence (or even thought about 
the situation) than it does to support his 
anti-abortion arguments.
Thaddeus Billman prefaced his article by 
stating he could not give factual details, 
then spent the rest of the article proving 
that statement. However, if he actually 
wishes to ever convince anyone of his argu
ments he had better learn how to give fac
tual details. And I further suggest he start 
by learning the difference between fact 
and opinion.

Ethernet absorbs students into its depths

Having nearly exhausted national and 
local controversies, I have decided to 
come down to the University level.
Whilst participating in CMUs tradi
tional extracurricular activity, surfing 
the net, I came across a site called 
AskJeeves.com. Strangely enough, this 
Web site purports to be designed such 
that if you ask it a question it will 
attempt to answer it by listing web sites. 
This seemed curiously appropriate given 
the University that I attend. Since I have 
arrived people have told me that the 
answers to all my problems  money, 
love, or other  were on the net. Either 
a site was already there, or I would 
become rich through what is known 
humbly as a start-up.
The theory being, I suppose, that com
puters lead to money lead to women lead 
to happiness. I have heard this train of 
logic inexorably and linearly repeated so 
many times I occassionally repeat it in 
my sleep out of habit. They must be cor
rect, everyone else thinks so.
Intrigued by the search engines for
mat, I decided to test the power of the 
bit-driven animal of a butler, so first, I 
asked him the all-important question 
What is a macaroon? The accursed 
machine on the other side of the line 
responded with three macaroon recipes, 
but not one definition. While disappoint
ing, this was acceptable because one of 
these recipes was without gluten, which 
sounded like an interesting proposition, 
although it raised some doubt as to 
whether macaroons made in that way 
would have sufficient stickiness. I there
fore concluded that AskJeeves.com had 
passed this first test of its validity.
I then proceeded to ask What is the 
meaning of life?, and true to its word 
AskJeeves.com produced many answers. 
I was surprised. I admit, I am not a real 
CMU student, and I did not believe that 
technology and the Internet held the 
solution to all of lifes problems. Here I 
seemed soundly disproven by a mere 
search engine.
Curiouser and curiouser, I thought, 
noting that both Monty Python and 
Wayne Holyoak had answered the mean
ing of life.
After investigating these response 
sites I decided they were all the same. 
None gave conclusive evidence as to 
their position. It was at this time when I 
came to a wondrous conclusion: a 
library, repository of those evil insidious 
cellulose derivatives, books, held more 
answers, and in a medium which did not 
require massive amounts of time or foolSee COMPUTERS, page 7

Prime conveys heartache
Tofu Inhibits Sex
by Justin Suissa
Recently, Optimus Prime came in 
at second place in the Student Body 
Treasurer election. While Optimus 
Prime may have not been an activi
ties fee-paying student, that should 
not render him ineligible to take the 
position. The winner of the race, 
one David Liber, is probably a good 
guy. I dont know him, but I cant 
say I am expecting that much 
change to come about from him.
However, if Optimus Prime were 
elected, I believe that a great deal of 
change would come about. As a 
matter of fact, if any of. the 
Transformers were to win a student 
body position at Carnegie Mellon I 
believe they would accomplish 
great things.
I recently had the opportunity to 
sit down with Optimus Prime and 
ask him about his position on issues 
vital to the CMU community.
Justin Suissa: If you had the 
opportunity to change anything on 
campus, what would it be?
Optimus Prime; [expletive delet
ed] Im not really sure.
Justin Suissa: What words would 
you like to say to the Student 
Treasurer?I
 Optimus Prime: Good luck,
[expletive deleted]'.
Justin Suissa: What student orga
nization would you give the most 
money to on campus?
O.ptimus Prime: The Robotics 
Club.
Justin Suissa: If you could be any 
animal, what animal would it be?
Optimus Prime: An iguana
because they are aggressive, and its 
like I could be in a club grinding up 
. to a girl I think likes' me, and she 
' blows me off. Its such a let-down 
man, if women would be aggressive 
, like iguanas everything would be than meets the eye.
Computer revolutionaries 
pass by simpler methods
cooler.
. Justin Suissa: Along that line, 
what qualities do you value most in 
a woman?
Optimus Prime: Im a traditional
ist, you know, if a woman wants to 
pay for dinner it just completely 
throws me off. Ill take her out for a 
nice dinner, and maybe a movie, 
and then she wants to take control, 
and I just dont know how to 
respond.
Justin Suissa: What do you do?
Optimus Prime: Well, on my last 
date I took her out to a movie and 
then I tried to be romantic, and 
gave her a little peck on the cheek 
and then she started to feel me up 
 and I started to whisper sweet 
nothings in her ear.
Justin Suissa: Oh really?
Optimus Prime: So things really 
didnt work out, but you know Im 
moving on with my life and making 
the best of things. I just dont deal 
well with interpersonal relation
ships well.
When I was little, my parents 
tried to take me to the scrap yard 
and recover all the expensive metals 
from my body. I was in such a 
slump for a few years that I could 
only transform into a Honda Civic 
... not an airplane ... or a boat.
Justin Suissa: This was before the 
cartoon?
Optimus Prime: Yea, like a year or 
two before that things just hit rockbottom. You know, I built these 
walls around me because I think I 
am so afraid of revealing too much 
of myself that I dont let people get 
inside, and really get to know the 
real me.
Justin Suissa: Thank you for your 
time.

ish horrible search engines.
Just think, the card catalog 
does not return 11,302 results, as 
Lycos does when you search for 
something as mundane as The 
Social Contract. In fact, for some 
strange reason, the top five hits in 
a card catalog do not include pri
vate law practices, and archeo
logical digs. How absurd!
Certainly knowledge availabili
ty on the Internet is a great thing.
 After all, getting things from 
places at the speed of light is in 
theory an amazing advancement. 
However, neglecting cohventional media is not appropriate 
behavior.
If this is the pinnacle of tech
nology, and search algorithms 
cannot be perfected much more, I 
say simplicity first. Use technolo
gy for the purpose for which it 
was designed. Computers are 
designed for calculation, and 
libraries for knowledge. And 
unless my computer can tell me 
why macaroons are the best 
snack ever, as can any of my 
friends, I say get up and learn 
other ways to do things. This
world needs more than just com
puter professionals, and the 
Internet is not Utopia.
Nanotechnology and the digital 
age may be upon us, but we did 
not stop using industrial 
machines or the steam engine 
after the industrial revolution. 
We adapted the old to the new 
instead of throwing out the old 
totally.
Show me a society composed 
entirely of computers, and people 
who work on computers, and I 
will show you a dead society, not 
to mention one with a low 
birthrate.
One last thing, interdiscipli
nary does not mean computers. 
For instance: putting computa
tional in front of every major, 
does not mean you have an exten
sive interdisciplinary program. 
Just a clarification.
Christopher May says, "There is 
never any reason to integrate elec
tric field over a closed surface, even 
if you want to know the amount of 
charge inside." Eat your snacks 
and beverages. Dont worry, be 
happy.

Well, its been over eight months 
since I first set foot on this campus 
as a student. Yep, eight months, 
three quarters of a 
year, and what do I 
have to show for it?

some left over Dinex.
But seriously, there 
must be some mod

some higher knowl
edge that I have gath
ered from a full acad

after eleven classes, 
countless exams, a 
handful of projects, 
labs, and the like, I 
suppose that I do 
have a decent 
amount of informa
tion to share with my 
fellow students.
Who knows?
Perhaps some incom

a hold of a copy of 
this paper, and have 
a better idea of what 
theyre getting themselves into. So

THE TARTAN  MAY 1, 2000
Writer carefully ponders future of fanhood in new surroundings
FANS, from page 12
So, even though Ive seen myself 
become a Pirates fan, and a 
Penguins fan, and a rainy-day 
Steelers fan, I know Ill never stoop 
so low as to become a Michigan fan.
I mean, I used to get so steamed 
up when players would go to a rival 
team as a free agent. Roger 
Clemens on the Blue Jays, and now 
the Yankees? Does he even remem
ber the late eighties when he was 
fighting to keep the Red Sox in the 
pennant race against these teams? 
Did I run over my Cito Gaston and 
Don Mattingly baseball cards with 
pie lawn mower for nothing? 
Rocket, cmon!
Okay, so thats a different issue 
entirely. Players respect the money, 
and were not getting paid to be 
fans. At least I dont think so. The 
way some of my family members 
talk, youd think they were on John 
Coopers personal payroll.
You dont expect me to visit you
up there, do you? my brother Dan 
says.
Michigan, thats great! says my 
grandfather. Youre sure you like 
this girl, right?
Still, I think that my loyalty 
shouldnt be called into question 
just because my girlfriend got into a 
great school, in a lovely town, with 
plenty of opportunities for me to 
write about the great sports life up 
there and maybe even give Ann 
Arbor an Ohio perspective.
Im sure theyll love what I have to 
say. They may even feel like leaving 
a note of congratulations or thanks 
in my mailbox, or on my wind
shield.
Now, about those spare plates...
Colt Foutz is happy to be headed for 
the glove, otherwise known as the 
great state of Michigan, where you 
dont need a road map, just the palm 
of your hand. Just dont expect many 
of those hands to be washed.Matt Blum/Art Staff
Reviewing the past year in sports moments, magic, and memories
YEAR, from page 12 
At the ECAC championships, the Tartans were able to 
hammer Misericordia 5-1 but were unable to match a 
very strong Johns Hopkins team, who beat CMU 3-0.
file photo by Ko Nakatsu/Darkroom Staff
The womens basketball team had a successful season, 
winning the ECAC Southern region tournament.
Four players on the team garnered All-UAA honors. 
Senior goalkeeper Benjamin Kartzman was named First 
Team All-UAA. Also capturing First Team honors was 
senior defender David Huryk.
Cross Country
Mens Final Record: 5th place in the NCAA D-III Mideast 
Region
Womens Final Record: 6th place in the NCAA D-III 
Mideast Region
The Tartan cross country teams had their promising 
seasons seemingly cut short this year at the Mideast 
region tournament, considering that in 1998, the teams 
placed 14th and fifth in the national championship meets.
Despite the teams inability to qualify for the national 
meets, there were individual performances that were 
good enough to qualify for the nationals. Senior Kenn 
Oldham finished 159th out of 212 at the nationals, and 
sophomore Brooke Cutler finished 71 out of 213.
Womens Volleyball
Record 40-6
With a 40-6 record, the womens volleyball team cap
tured the 1999 Eastern College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) South Region Volleyball Championship, with a 
3-0 win over Johns Hopkins University. On its way to the 
championship, CMU did not lose a game beating 
Pittsburgh-Bradford and Johns Hopkins.
This season marked the teams first post-season action
Dear Campus Community,
Each year Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity vigorously contributes to the efforts and 
spirit of Spring Carnival. This year, unfortunately, we feel that we conducted 
ourselves in an unacceptable manner. We would like the opportunity to apol
ogize to our peers, the University, and our Brothers.
Phi Kappa Theta was disqualified on Race Day, after a year of dedicated 
hard work. Though the disappointment we felt at this decision was under
standable, our actions were unjustified. We, as fraternity Brothers, strive to be 
gentlemen and our House has always upheld a reputation as such on cam
pus. Our actions during Carnival did not maintain the ideals we try to live 
by as a. fraternity.
Our House wishes to apologize to the University, including the faculty and 
administrators, for all behaviors that could have detracted from the Carnival 
experience. It is a contradiction to the purpose of our Chapter for our 
Brothers to infringe on anyones Carnival enjoyment. Our House is embar
rassed by our actions and want to re-establish our reputation as being a 
House that supports Carnival rather than one that disrupts it.
Please accept this letter of apology for any hurt or inconvenience Phi Kappa 
Theta may have caused at this year's Spring Carnival.
Sincerely,
The Brothers of Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity

ever. It also represented the first ever ECAC title for CMU 
athletics.
Sarah Putaro, who had 47 assists in the championship 
match, was named the MVP of the ECAC South Region 
Championships. Her record placed her at fourth in the 
nation with an average of 12.63 assists per game.
Mens Basketball
Final Record: 3-21
With a winning percentage of .125, the mens basket
ball team completed another season with only two UAA 
wins, and had three fewer wins overall than last year.
The team started the season slowly and seemed to play 
consistently, featuring an active full-court defense, but 
overall the team didnt perform at a level high enough to 
win many games.
With only one player lost to graduation, and several of 
the first-year players having gained some game experi
ence, the team looks to improve next season.
Womens Basketball
Final Record: 18-10
Capping the season with the Eastern College Athletic 
Conference Southern Region tournament championship, 
the womens basketball team played its first winning sea
son since 1992-1993, and its best year since 1991-1992, 
when the Tartans went 18-6.
In addition, the tournament win was the first title of 
any kind since the team won the UAA Championship in 
1990-1991.
Junior guard Lauren Petruzzi helped lead the team 
into and during the postseason, garnering UAA player of 
the week honors at one point and being named the ECAC 
tournament Most Valuable Player. Petruzzi recorded 21 
points, five rebounds, and five assists in the tournament 
semifinal, and contributed 13 points, five rebounds, five 
assists, and two steals in the final.
Other peak performers included senior Kara Coval (11
classified
points, eight rebounds in the semifinal, and 17 points and 
15 rebounds in the final) and first-year forward Erin 
Brady (10 points, 10 rebounds in the semifinal, and 17 
points in the final).
In the postseason, the players benefited from the fact 
that they didnt have great expectations to qualify for the 
tournament in the first place.
During the season, the Tartans performed valiantly 
against their fellow UAA teams, pulling off an important 
victory against New York University in January, and 
going 8-7 overall in the UAA.
Swimming
Mens Final Record: 3rd place in UAA, 14th in NCAA 
Division III
Womens Final Record: 6th place in UAA
This year, seven Tartan men swam at the NCAA 
Division III National Swimming and Diving 
Championships at Emory University. The swimmers 
helped CMU place 14th in the nation, the teams best fin
ish since its 12th-place ranking in 1992. Sophomore Ian 
Peters was named an All-American in two events, and 
received All-American honorable mention twice.
The team of Peters, Jon Alpert, Matt Shewchuk, and 
Michael Robinson gained All-American honors in the 
800-yard freestyle relay. Junior George Heidinger 
received All-American honors in three different events, 
and Heidinger teamed up with Robinson, Shewchuk, and 
Peters to earn All-American status in the 400-yard 
freestyle relay as well.
On the womens side, senior Erin Rockwell was the 
lone representative from the womens team to compete at 
the NCAA championships in Atlanta the week before ttfe 
mens championships. She earned All-American honor
able mention honors in the 100-yard breaststroke, in 
which she placed 12th in the nation. Rockwell aloqe 
helped Carnegie Mellon place 38th in the nation.

1999-2000: The Year in Sports at Carnegie Mellon
Football
Final Record: 8-3
The football team had a good season, finishing second in the UAA. In addi
tion seven of the team members were named to the All-UAA First Team.
The season started well, with the Tartans riding a four-game winning 
streak. A notable win was the 42-0 thrashing of the Case Western University 
Spartans in the Conference opener at home.
The Tartans homecoming game did not bode well, however, as they lost
7-3 to Dickinson College. The game was filled with turnovers and missed 
opportunities on offense, resulting in a long and frustrating game.
The Tartans also lost to Washington University, who ended placing first in

The football team played well this past fall, capturing Carnegie Mellon's firstever bowl game in winning the ECAC bowl game.
the conference. CMU ended its official season on a low note with a 23-7 loss 
to Thomas Moore College, but the Tartans record was strong enough to give 
them a chance to attend the ECAC bowl game.
And that was probably the teams crowning achievement. Appearing in 
their first postseason game since 1990 and their first bowl game since 1938, 
the Tartans were able to take home the first bowl game in school history. The 
team beat the heavily-favored Frostburg State Bobcats in a stunning 28-10 
victory. Senior rusher Mike Campie scored two touchdowns, and sophomore 
quarterback Eric Zimpfers outstanding play helped him win the ECAC 
Southwest Divisions most valuable player award.
In addition, Campie achieved a notable mark during the season, becoming 
Carnegie Mellons all-time leading rusher.
Womens Soccer
Final Record: 6-8-2
Nineteen ninety-nine saw nine new faces on the womens soccer team, and 
several of them had the chance to hit the ground running. The Tartans 
opened their season with an 8-0 romp over Washington and Jefferson 
University, and their dominance afforded many first-years the opportunity to 
get significant playing time and valuable experience.
From there, the team had an up-and-down season. Its first loss of the sea
son came in a tough 2-0 defeat at the hands of Johns Hopkins, followed by a 
2-2 tie against perennial rival Allegheny College. But the women bounced 
back with a pair of wins at home.
On October 8, the team headed out of town to face off against the power
ful Emory squad, ranked 10th in the nation at the time. The Tartans were 
down three goals, but rallied in the second half, playing what first-year play
er Melissa McMorrow called the best soccer we played all year. In the next 
two games, a tie against New York University 1-1 and a win against Grove 
City 2-1 kept the momentum going for the team.
The close of the season, however, proved challenging for the young Tartan 
team. The women had trouble capitalizing on scoring opportunities in a hardfile photo by Bryan Kaplan/Photo Editor

an improved record.
fought match against Brandeis, and dropped the game 1-0. Their final match 
against UAA rival Case Western University ended iri a 3-2 overtime loss. ;
The scores in several of the losses suffered by the Tartans did'not reflect 
how much the team controlled the matches. While their, record was not th|e 
best in recent years, the team gained a lot of valuable experience. With 18 
20 players, including 10 of 11 starters, returning next fall, expect the Tartap 
womens soccer team to be a force in 2000.
; i 4Mens Soccer
Final Record: 13-2-4
The mens soccer team had an excellent fall, just falling short of making the 
NCAA Division three championships. With a final record of 13-2-4, at one 
point during the season the team had a stretch of 10 games where they weiit 
unbeaten.

Sports ShortsUAA Tennis Championships
At the 2000 UAA Tennis 
Championships over the weekend, 
Carnegie Mellons mens tennis team 
made a strong showing, finishing in 
third place, out of eight teams, 
behind Emory University and 
Washington University. The womens 
team finished in seventh place.
On the mens side, the first round 
yielded a 6-1 victory over the 
University of Rochester, although 
the individual scores were closer 
than the finaj match score indicates. 
There were two three-set matches 
and several tie-breaks played, but 
the only match that Rochester was 
able to take from CMU was at the 
second singles position.
In the semifinals, the Tartans 
were crushed by Emory and sent 
into the last round competing for 
third place. All but one match 
resulted in straight-set defeats at 
the hands of the Emory players.
Kayvon Fatahalian, the Tartans 
first singles player, fought hard 
against Emorys first singles player,
Brett Kaplan, but eventually lost 
6-7 (7-1), 7-5, 6-2.
In the final round, CMU captured 
third place by crushing Case 
Western Reserve 6-1.
The womens team lost its first 
round match to Rochester, 7-2. 
First singles player Elisabeth Brown 
was involved in both of CMUs wins 
in that match, winning her first sin
gles match 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, and then 
teaming up with second singles 
player Annie Bosler to win first 
doubles, 9-7.
In the consolation round, the 
Tartans lost to Brandeis 5-2, with 
Bosler and Kelly Chanopas provid
ing the Tartans two victories.
In the final round, the women 
defeated Case Western Reserve,
8-1, to take seventh place.

Baseball nears seasons end
In what may have been the last 
game of the season for the baseball 
team; CMU put together a solid team 
effort and, behind a number of stand
out individual performances, defeat
ed Penn State-New Kensington on 
Sunday by an 11-5 count.
Tony Paez . pjtched.V six good 
innings before second baseman 
Dan Bogard was: brought, in to 
relieve him. Bogard closed out the 
game with three innings of work.
Paez, who owns a 3-1 record over 
the season, was the winning pitcher, 
and also helped his own cause with 
two hits and two runs batted in.
Other contributors included Jon 
Mayes; Bogard, who went 3-6 at 
the plate, had three RBIs and scored 
three runs; and Ramon Poo, who 
went 2-4 and scored three runs,
In addition, catcher John Moody i 
threw three runners Out, while j 
going 3-4 and scoring three runs. 1 
This season has thus % been a j 
struggle to reach an even record, ] 
and although the team has been on ] 
its way as of late, going' 3^-2 in its ; 
last five games, possible schedule . 
conflicts may prevent any more 
games from being played.
The weather hasnt been particu
larly cooperative either. According 
to coach Rich Greiser, the team has: 
had at least 10 games cancelled 
because of rain or snow. But thatN 
hasnt kept the Tartans fromgradu
ally getting.better. Vf. -
The teq^keeps getting ^better; 
each time we step on the field; so 
that bodes well for the future, said 
Greiser.
Overall, the team played many 
competitive games this year, some 
against top-ranked I schools. 
Greiser feels that being.-able to 
compete with these teams, shows 
that the Tartans are ready for a very 
successful season next year.

ble twenty-something headed into the real world, Ive been thinking about 
my future after CMU.
What will I do? Where will I go? And will another beer or six help make 
the future any clearer? (The answer is no, but sometimes it makes me feel 
like Ive got all year to decide.) And a lot of times, I worry. Well, lately Ive 
been worrying about license plates  specifically, mine.
You see, my girlfriend is also graduating, and unlike me shes got it all fig
ured out. Shes going to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to get her 
masters in social work, and basically, Im going to Ann Arbor to watch her 
get her masters in social work. Thats about all I know, so far, and Im fine 
with that. Ive spent six years getting two degrees, and I could use the 
breather.
What Im not so fine with is my Ohio license plates coming to Michigan 
with me while I take my breather. Why the concern, you might ask?
Its just that I cant help but worry about my license plate  which hap
pens to be currently attached to my new car  and how it might feel after
its been left alone on some dark Ann ----------------------------------------------------------------
Arbor road after a pack of ravenous 
Michigan Wolverines fans have care
lessly left it there, once theyve fin
ished disassembling the rest of my 
car and scattering it all over campus, 
after theyve burned it to scrap in a 
pep rally bonfire, that is.
Okay. Perhaps Im exaggerating.
Michigan fans hate Ohio State fans, 
but they probably wouldnt go to 
such extremes.
I dont burn all of my Steelers football 
cards anymore, or run them over with the 
lawnmower, or bury them in the back 
yard, or trade them to my grade school 
pen pal from Youngstown for nothing.
They dont have bonfires year round, just before Ohio State games. And 
a car cant really be burned to scrap, can it? The smashing with hammers 
and scratching with pocket knives probably takes care of that much more 
efficiently. So, perhaps Im being a little unrealistic.
But Im not kidding.
Ohio State and Michigan have a 95-year history of good old fashioned 
neighborly mistrust and mischief that isnt likely to end anytime soon, and 
isnt limited to the football field or any other sports venue.
For instance, I remember driving through Virginia with an uncle of 
mine when we were nearly sideswiped by a car going through a school 
zone like the roadrunner through a black tunnel painted onto a cliff. My 
uncle, who was born and raised in Dover, Ohio and who earned his PhD 
in Statistics at Ohio State, turns to me and says, Mustve been a Michigan 
driver.
The license plate read Missouri, The Show Me State.
Yeah, but hes probably from Michigan, originally. That, sports fans, 
from my uncle, the statistics professor. Probability, when applied to matters 
of sports fandom, is strictly relative.
I seem to have found some correlating principles, however.
For instance, if Michigan drivers are too fast, then Ohio drivers are too 
slow. And if the citizens of Ohio are hillbilly farmer folk, then the residents 
of Michigan are delinquent urban punks. Each and every last one of them. 
Trust me, Ive done my research. These apt characterizations can all be 
unearthed on any Michigan or Ohio State Internet discussion board.
Also dug up on the Michigan board was a rather elaborate plan for sys
tematically ridding the streets of all Buckeye-mobiles, so maybe you can 
understand why Im a little uneasy about leaving my car for the wrench-toting student section of the Schembechler Stadium bleachers. Still, Ill stop 
short of packing up my belongings two months in advance and hiking to 
Ann Arbor. Heres why.
Sports, like any cause you can rally behind, has its ardent supporters, its 
die-hard fans whom youll find bare-chested and howling at a sub-zero foot
ball game, or jawing with players from the opposing team who are unfortu
nate enough to get within earshot  or battery shot.
Remember, fan is short for fanatic. Still, these people must be reason
able. Take them out of the ballpark 
or arena, away from the roar of the 
crowd and the competitive fire of 
the game  not to mention the 
stench of spilled beer  and you 
wont find them any different from 
you or me.
Calmly explain to them that you 
may be rooting for a different team, 
wearing a different shade of color, 
or talking without a slight stutter 
and sure, theyre likely to break into 
a wide grin and walk away satisfied, their sense of pride in their own team 
unchallenged by your different set of beliefs. Of course, thats after theyve 
stuffed you in the nearest trash can and poured nacho cheese on your head. 
So maybe Ill have to hike, after all, but I still dont get why.
I mean, I spent 19 years of my life as an avid Cleveland Browns fan before 
moving to Pittsburgh and after six years here, I find myself wanting the 
Steelers to do well, make the playoffs, and then get crushed by Cleveland in 
the AFC Championship Game.
But its not like it used to be. I dont root for Pittsburghs entire depth at 
the quarterback to be pounded onto the disabled list by week three so their 
tight end will have to play the position. I dont burn all of my Steelers foot
ball cards anymore, or run them over with the lawnmower, or bury them 
in the back yard, or trade them to my grade school pen pal from 
Youngstown for nothing. Ive even stopped using my Terrible Towel Toilet 
Paper.
So, Ive lightened up. I appreciate both teams. And besides, the terrible 
towel roll had to have been made of a top secret blend of sawdust and cor
rugated cardboard. Youch!

Movies starring Robots, Teletubbies, and 
Pez win Best of* awards from Film Fest 9
by Greg Nofi
Entertainment Editor
This past week, many people took the 
opportunity to catch one of 
Filmmaking@CMUs six showings of 
Film Fest 9 inMcConomy Auditorium 
last week. Unfortunately, this annual 
event is probably the only showcase in 
America that does not have an awards 
ceremony. So in addition to all the 
Osjars, Golden Globes, Emmys, 
Gi^ajmmys, MTVs, TV Guides, and so 
on||without further ado, here are the 
awards for the better entries at this 
years film festival:
Best Hitchcock Protg: Evil Pez 
bjMorey Moosa. No matter how hard he 
tries, the poor victim just cannot evade 
the; wrath of his sinister-looking foe. 
This film has it all in the world of sus
pense: confusion, mind games, impossi
bilities, and even chaos. This piece 
would have made Alfred proud. Or, he 
mightve said, Wait! Youre talking 
about a damn mouse head Pez dis
penser!
Best Portrayal of Geek 
Delinquency: Robotic Graffiti Writer 
by*. Institute for Applied Autonomy 
(IAA). Was it a mockumentary? 
Perhaps. But lets give these guys the 
benefit of the doubt and assume this 
robot is for real. That would be cool, 
siijjze this little character can be pro
grammed to spray-paint a pre-pro
grammed message onto a sidewalk or 
street. As the film shows, the IAA has 
piy; the fun back in vandalism. Even 
Gig, Scouts and homeless people had a 
bl^st with it.
Best Attempt to Make Jerry 
Falwell Very Very Mad: Real Life 
Teltubby Adventure by Coffin and
Secasa. Did you ever wonder if the 
Teletubbies are really that innocent 
and cute? Wouldnt it be great if there 
was a deeper, darker side to them that 
would take them off the air, a la Pee 
Wee Herman? You dont have to wait 
any longer as this film shows the dude 
with the corkscrew head getting com
pletely drunk and high until he passes 
out in an alleyway. Imagine what this 
piece would be like if the subject was 
the purple, purse-toting Teletubby?
Best Example that Less is 
More: 195:1. by McCullough, Mauro, 
and Lentz. In the time it takes you to 
read this paragraph, the VHS camera 
used to shoot this film has already 
made it from Toronto to the entrance 
of McConomy. A really powerful fast 
forward button can do wonders.
Best What the...?: a video by peter 
burr by Peter Burr. Every year, theres 
always that film which leaves the 
audience scrambling for any kind of 
coherent reaction as their visual and 
aural senses are pounded with, well, 
nonsense. At least this years What 
the...? film was one of the funniest of 
the festival. This entry consists of the 
following: diseased and rotting teeth, 
that Dueling Banjos song, and some 
funky interpretative dance. It would 
be cool if this hilarious three-minute 
film were made electronic and distrib
uted around Network Neighborhood. 
That way, future freshmen can also 
say, What the...?
Best Blair-Witch-Project-onAcid Film: Night Trip by Blair 
Erickson. This half-hour 
Filmmaking@CMU production is a lot 
like Blair Witch on acid. For one thing, 
the characters in the film really were 
dropping acid. Things begin to get 
scary when they start driving in a
sparsely forested area during a road 
trip. The production and special 
effects for this film were breathtaking, 
even if you werent tripping.
Best/Worst Intermission: The
intermission by Filmmaking@CMU 
and Dramats. This intermission piece 
highlighting the funniest outtakes 
from filmmakings auditions was very 
good because it was so funny. On the 
other hand, it was also a bad intermis
sion because it was so funny. Darn that 
intermission for making me stay and 
watch instead of using the bathroom!
Best Animated Zombies: Route 
666 by Lebigre, Lin, and Ruzanka. You 
just have to love computer animation, 
especially when it depicts a bunch of 
superheroes blowing up a gas station 
full of zombies.
Most Promising Competitor to 
Out Of Courage: Wheres the
Package? by Bob Rost. Everyone 
remembers Out of Courage, that big 
over-the-top, action spectacle that 
stormed the Film Festival last year. 
But the audiences reaction showed 
that Wheres the Package? proved to be 
a strong challenger. All it took was 
some sunglasses, cleverly-placed 
sound effects, and Mortal Kombat 
energy bars.
Film most likely to make Paul 
Thomas Anderson proud: Cellular 
Jungle by Filmmaking@CMU. At 15 
minutes, this film was. eons shorter 
than Magnolia. Nevertheless, Cellular 
Jungle impressively linked together 
several different characters struggles 
with a modern nemesis: that annoying 
cell phone. Even for a film festival, the 
storyline was quite unique, only sur
passed by the beautiful production of 
the film.
Work in Progress screens laborrelated documentaries, classics
by Thaddeus Billman
Staffwriter
Do you like your job? I mean 
really like it? Well, the real life 
characters in Fast, Cheap, & Out 
of Control do.
Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control 
was one of several movies pre
sented this past weekend as 
part of the Work in Progress: 
A Festival of Steel, Sweat, and 
American Cinema film festi
val. Ranging from classics to 
new releases, from documen
taries to comedies, the film fes
tival provided something for 
everyone.
Take Modern Times, a 1936 
silent comedy starring Charlie 
Chaplin, for example. Written 
and directed by Chaplin, it was 
his final silent film. Both funny 
and serious at the same time, 
the film carries strong mes
sages about work, capitalism, 
and America in general. The 
viewer is presented with such 
sights as the absurdity of the 
assembly line and a contrap
tion that allows workers to con
tinue working as they eat 
lunch. Later, we see Chaplin 
arrested first for being a com
munist leader, then for being a 
union thug, of which he was 
neither. The movie isnt per
fect, but considering when it 
was made, it stands as true 
masterpiece, rivaling todays 
best films.
Then there is On the 
Waterfront, another classic. 
Filmed by the legendary 
director Elia Kazan, it stands 
as a personal triumph for him 
more than anything else. In
January 1952, Kazan named 
names in his appearance 
before the infamous House 
Committee on Un-American 
Activities (HUAC). This 
action led to him bing criti
cized and even harassed by 
the Hollywood elite. Despite 
attempts to intimidate him, 
he continued to make movies. 
On the Waterfront stands as 
his masterpiece, despite 
being produced after the 
HUAC incident and despite 
widespread distaste for him 
when it was released.
On the other end of the 
spectrum, and indeed at the 
extremes of filmmaking, is 
Michael Moores Roger and 
Me. One cant help but admire 
Moores sarcastic manipula
tive style, even if they dis
agree with what he has to say. 
Roger and Me stands as the 
top-grossing documentary 
ever, a real tribute to the 
films quality. The movie is a 
semi-autobiographical look at 
the decline of Flint, Michigan 
as General Motors shut down 
production plants, moving 
them to Mexico where labor 
was cheap. Moore attacks 
both GM and the United 
Autoworkers Union at once. 
Moore is often classified as an 
ultra-liberal, but even a 
staunch conservative like 
myself can appreciate his 
unique, entertaining look at 
the world in which we live.
Another documentary, 
Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control, 
presents a fascinating look at 
the nature of work. In it we 
have four men who really 
love their jobs. There is Dave
the animal trainer/circas 
performer, George the gar> 
dener, Ray the naked roje 
mat specialist, and Rodne 
the robotics engineer. Wg 
have two characters looking 
back  Dave and George ^ 
as their fields die out, and 
two characters looking for
ward  Ray and Rodney 
as their fields are just stag
ing to develops
Cinematographer Robert 
Richardson employs what he 
calls the kitchen sink 
approach, where a variety of 
film formats are intertwined; 
into one cohesive wholSr 
Bringing together 35miji* 
16mm, black & white, still? 
archive footage, and moili? 
the film features some of the 
best editing one will ever see
Perhaps one of the more 
popular movies screened thds 
weekend was Thursda 
nights Flashdance. Filmed %i 
Pittsburgh, it stars Jennifei 
Beals as a steelworker, 
night, she also performs as ^ 
exotic dancer, but her dream 
is to become a ballerina. The 
real star of Flashdance^ 
though, is its soundtrack^ 
Featuring Irene Cara^g 
Flashdance ... What a.' 
Feeling, and Michael. 
Sembellos Maniac, the 
platinum-selling soundtrack 
made a big contribution to 
the films popularity.
With great films like thesji 
and plenty of others not men? 
tioned here, the film festival 
was sure to be a success. Two 
thumbs up to the students-of 
Kathy Newmans class whc5 
put the festival together.

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UNDERGROUND
CELEBRATING ITS FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF OPERATION
6 r n eg g 666 i M6 g LlgI 6d L i H
Auto/Visual/Indi/Visible exhibition 
features works by School of Art faculty
by Blake Engel
Personnel Manager
Its true: our professors do work, 
too! The campus community got a 
taste of how great that work can be 
last Friday in the Regina GougerMiller Gallery when faculty from 
the School of Art opened their 
Auto/Visual/Indi/Visible exhibi
tion.
The first floor primarily houses a 
series of videos produced by James 
Duesing, Suzie Silver, and John 
Sturgeon. Each producer illustrates 
with skill some human emotion or 
state such as over-commercializa
tion/lesbianism, or family struggles.
Going up in the elevator, there 
are thumbnail guides to each floors 
highlights. On the second floor, one 
of them is Mary Weidners They 
that sow in tears shall reap in joy, a 
many-layered, irregular-shaped 
swirl of colors. Walking by it gives a 
sensation of motion like walking by 
rows of trees and watching the suc
cessive gaps shift.
Suzanne Slavics Caritas is a 
series of three panels, the left and 
right ones with a texture that 
resembles a desert surface, but has
One of Suzanne Slavics pieces that depicts

) roughly textured rhinoceros.
interspersed curl shapes that come 
to life as you get closer to them. The 
center panel depicts a tablecloth-, 
covered table with napkins dan
gling off its edges, seen from above. 
It, too, with its quadratic folds 
shows deep dimension.
On the third floor, College of Fine 
Arts Dean Martin Prekops pho
tographs loom over the visitor. 
Taken with an 8-by-10 camera, 
these forest scenes have clearly 
been modified, almost a la Blair 
Witch Project. Twigs piled up on the 
ground and a series of small metal
squares tied together force viewers 
to study the images.
The black sheep of the exhibition 
may have been Feedback by Jon 
Beckley which, in three successive 
photographs, chronicles the heal
ing of an incision on a mans back. 
Below the shocking images, four 
small boom boxes blare out for your 
attention, repeating phrases like 
Im back! Im back! and get back, 
get back!
The exhibit is a powerful addi
tion to the Gallerys inaugural 
season, and runs until June 23.
Student body election apathy mirrors 
the nations lack of political concern
Behnam Farahpour/Contributing Editor
'.-Professor Mary Weidner displayed her piece, They that sow in tears shall reap in joy at the Miller Gallery last Friday.
Less Stress?
by Emily Landes
Another Student Senate election 
has gone by and a record low 
turnout at the polls has been 
recorded. Only five percent of 
undergraduates voted in the elec
tions for Student Body President 
and the second runner up was a fic
tional 80s cartoon character/action 
figure. While this is a sad statement 
in and of itself, my main concern is 
that these poor proceedings will 
only serve to teach the newest gen
eration of voters to be as apathetic 
as the current generation. 
(According to polling statistics, only 
18 percent of the U.S. population 
voted in this years presidential pri
maries.)
Some of the suggestions made in 
order to increase Student Senate 
voter turnout include increased 
publicity for Senate and for the elec
tion proceedings themselves. I 
believe that these are very intelli
gent ideas that, if implemented, can 
only improve our voter turnout. In 
fact, I believe that these suggestions 
are so wise that they should be 
applied on a wider scale, like, say, 
for future U.S. elections.
Increased advertising for Senate 
elections is one of the most easily 
implemented changes that would 
improve voter participation. 
Admittedly, posters for elections 
were up; all you had to do was look. 
The problem is that no one on this 
campus has time to look. Hell, we 
barely have time to glance. 
Therefore, if the election board 
wants us to know about elections, 
they have got to inundate us with 
ads. Otherwise, we arent going to 
see them.
The same idea holds true for pri
mary elections. Despite all the news 
coverage in a multitude of different 
media, only about half the people 
that I spoke to in my home state of 
New York had any idea that pri
maries were taking place that Super 
Tuesday. Pennsylvanias primaries 
took place nearly a month after 
March 7, that fateful Tuesday when
the nominations for Gore and Bush 
had all but been decided and also 
the date when most public interest 
in the primaries dissolved. Thus, 
even fewer people that I spoke, to 
who are registered in this state 
showed any knowledge that primary 
elections were taking place. This is 
no less than tragic. We need to cre
ate a Go Vote ad campaign, similar 
to MTVs Rock the Vote but on a larg
er scale, that will make it impossible 
for people to forget about elections.
An even more effective tactic 
would be to inundate the population 
with ads that tell us not only where 
and how to vote, but why. On our 
campus, unfortunately, the popular 
feeling seems to be: It doesnt matter 
if I vote, because Student Senate 
doesnt really do anything that 
affects me directly anyway. Except 
maybe try to give themselves free 
parking.
The reason that this myth persists 
has a lot to do with the lack of pub
licity surrounding the many activi
ties and policies that Student Senate 
has a part in. Senate provides fund
ing for numerous worthy causes and 
campus organizations, but because 
they do not advertise this fact no one 
even knows that they are involved.
Therefore, Student Senate must 
begin an aggressive public relations 
campaign. They need a hip logo, and 
a catch phrase. Something along the 
lines of Student Senate did this! 
Can you imagine it? Student Senate 
did this! hanging over the 
Morewood Underground. Student 
Senate did this! flags flying proudly 
at nearly every activities fee funded 
event.
Even ads that tell us how much 
potential power and money Student 
Senate has would be helpful. Signs 
reading President Cohon regularly 
meets with our representatives or 
We have over 800,000 dollars at 
our disposal would certainly get 
peoples attention. Once everyone 
realizes just how much Student 
Senate actually does, or could do, 
more students, representing a wide 
range of ideas, will run for office. It 
is then, and only then, that we can
expect voting numbers to go up. |
Once again, I believe that a sinjilar 
tactic could be used to increase vjjter 
participation throughout the coun
try. It cannot-be that only 18 peient 
of the country voted in the primaries 
because the other 82 percent simply 
did not know about it. Instead, tljiere 
must be a feeling that: It dodsnt 
matter if I vote, because the 
President doesnt really do anything 
that affects me directly anyway. 
Except maybeget himself cute 1 ttle 
interns.
Better public relations could help 
here as well; It seems ridiculous, but 
clearly if people are not voting tihey 
must not realize how much power 
and ihoney-the future President will 
have. We already have a logo, i the 
presidential seal. We also already 
have an effective campaign idea in 
the Census 2000 ad-blitz. IJntil 
recently, most people believed that 
filling out their census didnt matter. 
But, after an ad campaign featuring 
lacking daycare, overcrowded 
schools and faulty municipal equip
ment as the probable result^ of 
throwing away the census form, fiow 
could anyone not take 15 minutes to 
fill it out?
The same idea would work J for 
voting as well. We simply show peo
ple how important it is to vote, |and 
what power the president }ias. 
Then, just like Student Senate, \yed 
get not only a larger voting pool,1 but 
hopefully candidates who more 
accurately .represent the views of 
Americans.,
The issue of voting in Student 
Senate is not a trivial one. Perhaps, 
even if changes arent made in wider 
electoral practices, by seeing tiiat 
our votes do matter on campus, our 
generation of voters will finally 
break through the electoral indiffer
ence which is currently strangling 
the democratic process.
As a registered New York voter; 
Emily Landes gets to choose between a 
fascist and a fake in this Novembers 
Senate elections. But she is still going 
to vote, even if she. has to cast it for 
Optimus Prime.
f GOOD LUCK \ 
ON FINALS! y 
We look forward to 
serving the campus 
community in the 
fall with a new 
look and a new i 
\and expanded J x menu. /

jj ' ' 
He said his goal was to have Senate, in 
addition to appropriating funds to activi
ties, hear students complaints about the 
university. He said he was optimistic 
about these goals because there were 
enough young, open-minded senators to 
change things, but enough older ones to 
keep the Senate in line. The idea behind 
Konopkas proposed changes was to 
increase the student input in student gov
ernment decisions.
TEN YEARS AGO
May 1, 1990  The student body struck 
down a . proposal to raise the Student 
Activities Fee from $80 to $100 per year. 
Although the referendum showed that
students were against the increase, the 
no vote did not completely stop the 
increase. The Board of Trustees eventu
ally determines the fee and Student 
Senate can recommend an increase in the 
fee without a yes vote from the student 
body.
FIVE YEARS AGO
April 24, 1995  Questions arose over 
the legality of a budget hearing meeting 
held by Student Senate due to an over
sight of their governing by-laws. These 
by-laws state that At the end of the com
mittee budget hearings, all organizations 
requesting subsidies' from the Student 
Activities Fee will be listed in The Tartan
and The Student Union along with the 
subsidies recommended by the Senate 
Funding and Recognition Committee and 
the dates for Student Senates hearing of 
budgets. After debate on the issue, 
Senate determined that an email sent out 
by the Senate Chair to student organiza
tions fulfilled the intentions of the by
law. Senate also violated their by-laws 
by voting to suspend fiscal policy in less 
than the one week minimum notice 
required to hold a vote on that matter.
ONE YEAR AGO
April 26, 1999  A deal was solidified 
between Carnegie Mellon and Port 
Authority Transit to allow those with
CMU identification to ride Pittsburgh 
public transportation. The plan, which 
would take effect July 1, would cost CMU 
$567,500. To cover costs, a $35 semesterly transportation fee would be assessed to 
student accounts. Final decisions regard
ing the fee would wait until ridership sta
tistics could be determined and the fee 
was subject to going up or down by at 
most five dollars per year. Following the 
first semester, the fee was reduced to $28 
per semester and applied retroactively to 
the previous semester. The new system 
appealed most to off-campus students 
who rely on public transpprtation.

BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP)  An 
effort to force Kellogg Co. to stop 
using genetically altered crops failed 
when shareholders overwhelmingly 
defeated a resolution.
Friday's vote came amid claims 
' from two groups of nuns that the 
crops are unsafe and put the compa

the resolution was voted down by 94 
percent of the shareholders.
, The company has removed or is in 
the process of removing such ingre

Australian products, but has 
declined to do so in the United

Rival project begets debate of key issues in 
Fifth and Forbes redevelopment project
by Brad Grantz
Business Editor
As the furor continues over the 
redevelopment of one of the most 
crucial pieces of a viable downtown 
Pittsburgh, many different civic 
groups, partnerships, agencies, and 
individuals are weighing in with 
their particular opinions or stances. 
Recently, a rival plan to Mayor Tom 
Murphys Marketplace at Fifth and . 
Forbes, the Main Street plan was 
introduced to City Council. 
Additionally, the financial statistics 
of both are now available.
Main Street
Not only did the April 17 City 
Council public hearings on the Fifth 
and Forbes arena provide for an 
interesting examination of an alter
nate proposal (Main Street pro
gram), it also offered a great deal of 
insight into the political system, or 
posturing system. Nevertheless, the 
Main Street proposal offered a 
strikingly different financial plan as 
opposed to Marketplace at Fifth and 
Forbes. Although an overriding 
theme at the meeting was a call for 
all interested parties to bring their 
issues to the proverbial table, it is 
unlikely that a consensus will ever 
be formed, not only because of the 
extreme differences in the redevel
opment plans, but also because of 
the large amount of political 
wheeling and dealing is occur
ring.
The Mayors Marketplace plan 
calls for the demolition of 62 build
ings and the preservation of 12 
facades in order to rebuild the area, 
complete with underground park
ing, into the retail, dining, and 
entertainment hub of the region.

The Main Street proposal includes an Incubator Mall in the second and third floors of the G.C. Murphy and Donahoe's 
buildings. The incremental development also hopes for a farmers' market in the Murphy's building and loft housing, 
upper floor adaptive reuse for retail tenants. Proponents also hope to address smaller, quality of. life issues with such 
innovations as rooftop environments, bicycle facilities, and flower baskets.
Critics have challenged that the 
plan would cost too much for the 
taxpayers, cause too much disrup
tion, harm the displaced mer
chants, and destroy the historic fab
ric of the community. However, 
even skeptics agree that a change 
needs to be made in the Fifth and 
Forbes Avenue corridor.
The Main Street redevelopment 
approach, sponsored by the Golden 
Triangle Community Development 
Corporation (GT-CDC) and led by 
Main Street consultant Terry 
Neciai, hopes to create a critical 
mass using incremental steps. The 
plan dictates monies for faade 
restoration and/or preservation, 
new loft housing, a technology 
incubator mall, a farmers market, 
and other quality-of-life issues. 
However, opponents worry the plan 
may take too long to revitalize the
area and isnt the right idea for 
reestablishing a regional hub. They 
add that the project doesnt include 
larger draws such as national 
chains and theaters.
At the public hearing, Wendy 
Nicholas, Northeast National Trust 
representative, denounced the 
outmoded, mega-scale approach 
to development and called for 
broader public and developer par
ticipation. Nicholas concluded the 
addition of other Fifth and Forbes 
business improvement plans could 
only heighten the level of success in 
the project, as competition breeds 
better ideas. Nicholas also alluded 
to cities that have built their appeal 
on preservation, namely Savannah, 
Charleston, and Boston.
* Mac Nichols, a senior program 
Director for the National Trust, fol
lowed Nicholas, explaining the
destruction of urban renewal. 
Nichols argued that large-scale, 
urban development destroys the 
social fabric of a community while 
uprooting the small businessman.
After much introduction, Main 
Street presented their much-antici
pated answer to Mayor Murphy via 
Necciai. Necciai stated that Main 
Street looks at the past and builds 
on it. He voiced his viewpoint that 
the old structures downtown are 
the capital to make Main Street a 
viable program, including such 
ideas as embracing the numerous 
terra-cotta buildings. Necciai relat
ed how it would be necessary to 
inform owners of the methods of re
painting a cast-iron building and 
why that was instrumental to their 
real estate and the community. He

Mike Kobold, a junior managerial 
economics student, started collect

by the devices. However, as he 
became more knowledgeable about 
the watch industry and collecting, 
his watch choices became more 
upper class and expensive.
Eventually, I could only get the 
pricey wtcheson Christmas and 
my birthday, surmised Kobold.
Knowing that the high-priced 
timepieces could be purchased 
much cheaper at wholesale prices, 
Kobold began to dabble as a distrib

handmade watches of Chronoswiss. 
He accounted for 5% of the yearly 
sales of watchmaker Dubey &

his competitors in one way: he did

Alchemy had fallen apart because the 
two sides could not agree on certain

Towers' Phoenix consortium was the 
only possibility to continue operating 
Rover in the desired way.
British workers had feared a sale to 
Alchemy would cost far more jobs 
thin if the Towers consortium could
takeover. BMW said its failure to stem 
the red ink at Rover was mainly due to 
the strength of the British pound, 
which makes it more expensive to 
build cars in Britain and sell them in 
continental Europe.
Some investors reacted to the 
breakoff with Alchemy Friday by sell
ing off their BMW shares, sending 
prices down 2.3 percent from

made by highly respected suppliers, 
such as Rolex and Omega, Kobold 
isnt cutting costs elsewhere either. 
The movements are the same that 
are found in Breitling and Tag 
Heuer watches. Additionally, 
Kobold wristwatches are completely 
mechanical, ignoring the use of the 
quartz battery that can be found in 
less expensive timepieces.
Our watches are designed for use 
by professionals and thus we can 
only sell premium quality time
pieces, says Kobold, whose watches 
are worn by Navy pilots, SWAT 
sharpshooters, explorer Sir Ranulph 
Fiennes, and others who count on  
the precision of Kobold. We are 
currently in negotiations with 
NASA, which wants our watches for 
one of their shuttle missions, 
Kobold continued.
Kobolds corporation is utilizing 
the skill of Helmut Sinn, an 84-yearold German pilot and highly touted 
watch craftsman. Sinn, with his 50 
years of experience in watchmak

handmade production of the time

Last summer, Kobold began man

open up shop in May online at 
www.koboldwatch.com. While his 
production may be overseas, Kobold 
feeds off the Pittsburgh region.
Pittsburgh is a great city to do 
business in for a German-American 
company, Kobold stated. You have 
a number of large German compa
nies here, excellent law firms that 
know how the system in Germany 
works, a very well-connected inter
national airport, and cheap labor as 
well.
While his company employs 20 
individuals in the grand scheme of 
his online venture, he utilizes the 
talents of seven CMU students. 
Kobold cited several reasons why he 
outsources responsibilities to these 
type of individuals.
Carnegie Mellon students care 
about what they do and they pay 
attention to what they are doing. 
Our executive vice president is a 
GSIA student, stated Kobold.
He also knows that as time pro
gresses, the students who worked 
for him will establish new contacts 
that may encourage future success
es for Kobold, much like his old faceto-face salesmanship.

Where is it going to blow today?
SEATTLE (AP)  Microsoft Corp. 
has vowed to fight the federal gov
ernments plan to break up the com
pany into two separate parts, a bat
tle that will begin not in court, .6ut 
in the stock market on Monday. <
Thats when traders return to 
Wall Street, where the companys 
stock will be under the microsc6pe 
 offering a key test of consumers 
confidence in the company. Por 
Microsoft, it signals the start of a 
long battle.
On Friday, the U.S. Justice 
Department and 17 of the 19 states 
that filed antitrust complaints 
against Microsoft submitted a plan 
to a federal judge to break the com
pany into two new businesses. J
One company would retain the 
popular Windows operating system, 
which runs the majority of the 
worlds computers, while the other 
would consist of Microsofts appli
cations and Internet products. The 
plan must be approved by U'.S. 
District Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson. r
To help bolster its case in the 
court of public opinion, Microsoft 
was to begin showing TV ads on 
Sunday featuring chief executive 
Steve Ballmer. Today the company 
will run a full-page ad in most major 
newspapers. The ad details the com
panys position and warns of the 
impact a breakup would have.
The court battle comes at a criti
cal time for the company, which is 
facing increased competition oh a 
number of fronts such as the Linux 
operating system and a new plat
form from the America Online and 
Time Warner merger.
I think theres a general sense of 
vulnerability over at Microsoft, 
said Jonathan Zittrain, executive 
director of the Berkman Center'rfor 
Internet and Society at Harvard Law 
School. Windows is starting' to 
show its age.... Theyll be forced to 
reinvent themselves again while"' at 
the same time, handling this case.Smooth, creamyprofit at Hersheys
.1!
HERSHEY, Pa. (AP)  .When 
caramel maker Milton S. Hershey 
created his now-famous milk choco
late bar 100 years ago, he had little 
doubt about the key to his product's 
success. Give them quality, he 
said. Thats the best kind of adver
tising in the world.
In 1905, Hershey opened the 
worlds largest chocolate mantrfac-' 
turing plant and built a strong 
brand name by mass-producing 
quality chocolates. A century later, 
Hershey Foods Corp. has found that 
making good chocolate is not 
enough. The companys earnings 
fell after delays with a new automa
tion system hampered delivery of 
Halloween and Christmas candies 
last year.
Now, having shipped its products 
for the busy Easter season, the 
nations largest candymaker says its 
problems are largely behind ' it. 
Delivery times, it say, have 
improved, and the company is now 
hiring workers for a new distribu
tion center set to begin operating 
soon. Technology, however, turned 
out to be more of a hindrance than a 
help last year. Delays in completing 
a $112 million automated ordemng 
and distribution system stalled 
deliveries, caused sppt shortages of 
Hersheys candy and inflated oper
ating costs during the Halloween 
and Christmas seasons. The compa
nys earnings fell in the third and 
fourth quarters as it scrambled to 
get the system running and smooth 
relations with retailers.
Meanwhile, Hersheys is introduc
ing several new products such as 
Twizzlers Twist-n-Fill licorice, 'Big 
Kat chocolate wafers and Jdlly 
Rancher ChewMongus. It also is 
stepping up its e-commerce efforts, 
in hope of continuing the tenfold 
increase in Internet sales it enjoyed 
last year. Despite Hersheys recfent 
challenges, analysts remain opti
mistic about the companys ldngterm prospects.

NASDAQ returns to former glory as 
older blue chips and DOW stumble
_ MARKET MADNESS
by Thaddeus Billman
The NASDAQ sized up significant 
gains for the second straight week, 
as an apparent market rally contin
ued. The week began poorly, as 
news of the governments proposal 
to break Microsoft in two leaked. 
The NASDAQ composite opened 
Monday at 3,466177 points, or 
4.9% below Fridays close. The 
index continued to drop for most of 
the] day reaching a low of 3,345 
before rallying in the final hour to 
close at 3,482. The late rally was to 
set the tone for the rest of the week.
On Tuesday, the NASDAQ opened 
at 3592 and never looked back, clos
ing.. at 3711, a gain of 6.6% 
Wednesday saw mixed results ard 
the index closed down slighty. 
Thursday looked bleak early as,he 
composite opened down over 100 
points, but the dip only triggered 
new buying and a daylong rallythat 
leftrthe index at 3,774.
Friday proved miraculous/as the 
NASDAQ continued to rise despite 
terrible economic data. It cosed at 
3,8.60, a significant figure./or tech
nicians, putting the indecs close 
above last weeks high.
Things were not so rosf for other 
stock indexes, however, The Dow 
Jones Industrial averse finished 
down 111 points, or l/o while the
broader |>&P 500 edged out a slight 
gain. It jlppears that investors have 
returne/ to their old favorite, the 
NASDAy, despite numerous warn
ings thit it is still way overvalued by 
conventional measures.
As ine commentator put it, the 
perception of an invincible market 
remans prevalent in the average 
penons mind.
Iiternet stocks, not surprisingly, 
registered the greatest gains. 
ErKoop.com (KOOP) more than 
doubled at one point, on news that 
AOL and others agreed to take stock 
instead of cash for debts owed.
By the end of the week, KOOP 
gave back most of its gains as 
investors realized the true meaning 
of the announcement, that is KOOP 
simply doesnt have the cash to pay 
its debts, and the debtors only took 
stock because it is better than noth
ing. Companies often issue stock to 
pay debts as a final desperation 
effort to avoid bankruptcy.
Register.com (RCOM) jumped 
over 40% on Friday for no apparent 
reason. Its close of $51 a share is the 
highest since April 10th and is about 
170% higher its low set last week. 
NetZero (NZRO) jumped from 
under $12 a share to $17 in two 
days, only to be trading at 12 again 
days later. On Friday, it jumped 
again, hitting a high of $15 1/8 a 
share shortly after the open, only to
close the day with a net gain of 0. 
CDNow (CDNW) continued its rally, 
finishing at $4 5/16, up 1/2 or 13%. 
It is now up 43% from its low.
Big name technology companies 
were not left out of the party. Yahoo 
(YHOO) gained 7 points, or 5.8%. 
However, it remains 35% below its 
March high. Amazon.com (AMZN) 
gained $3 a share, or 5.4%. AMZN 
remains 27% below its high of just 
over 75. Meanwhile, eBay.com 
(EBAY) gained 9 points, or 6%, leav
ing it 38% below its March high. 
Intel (INTC) did even better increas
ing $111/2 a share or 10%, leaving 
it only 13% off its all-time high. 
Even Microsoft (MSFT) had a 
decent week, all things considered, 
gaining back some of its losses suf
fered on Monday.
Not all technology companies 
were taken up in the rally, however. 
Most notably, MP3.com (MPPP) 
plummeted nearly 40% to close at 
$7 a share on Friday.
The decline was triggered by a 
federal judges ruling that the com
panys My MP3.com service violat
ed copyright law. They now face 
damages of up to $6 billion, 
although a figure in the hundred 
millions is more likely. MP3.com 
said theyd appeal the decision. 
MPPP is now down an incredible 
93% from its high of 105 reached 
shortly after its IPO.

The North Oafland-based tech

ated by CMU graduates and broth
ers Henry and Tommy Wang have 
helped create another success: 
USInterns.com
USInterns.ccm recently sent its 
web-based service into operation. 
The company is hoping to revolu
tionize the way students gain 
employment at companies. As cor
porations hpe to entice talent to 
full-time employment through 
intgrnships USInterns.com offers 
services for both students looking 
forJ:apprerticeships and companies 
searchingfor the right employee.
USInteiris.com currently has 250 
companies registered for the site 
and 1,200 Students representing 61 
colleges.
Students who register need not 
worry about sending out a blanket 
resume. .Different skills and talents 
allow employers to search for indi
viduals v/ho meet their specific cri
teria. Ths system also creates an 
arena foninstant feedback between 
the company and job-seeker. 
Registered young adults can also
track the number of times their 
resume has been examined by 
prospective companies.
The need for a comprehensive 
online resource for internships is 
simply not being met by traditional 
recruiting methods or online job 
recruitment sites, which are focused 
mostly on full-time employment, 
said Steve Higgins, chief executive 
officer ofUSInterns.com.
He added The impact of the cur
rent economy means that talented 
employees are in greater demand 
now than ever before, and as the 
window of opportunity for recruit
ment lias shrunk, internships have 
become the source for early recruit
ment.
The web site also offers students 
the ability of advanced searches and 
queries by industry, geography, skill 
set, or organization. The site also 
allows students to build their 
resume and apply for positions 
directly online. Other resources are 
available related to job hunting and 
career planning.
USInterns.com employs college 
students to handle a nationwide 
recruiting effort to get pupils to sign 
up for the program.
Mayor Tom Murphy, on hand for
the announcement of the launch of 
the site, was all smiles.
This represents a cultural 
change. It is an example of the 
entrepreneurial opportunity that 
we need to encourage in Pittsburgh. 
They [USInterns.com] are helping 
to write the changing story of 
Pittsburgh.
Maureen May, an advisor in the 
career placement services at the 
University of Pittsburgh was encour
aged by the company. They offer 
the convenience of hopping on a 
Web site to get an internship.
Pitt provides a student database 
of all student resumes on file. 
Companies can access the database 
via Pitts career services.
May said she didnt feel that 
USInterns.com as a private venture 
could replace the more traditional, 
college administration task of pro
viding students with internship 
searches. The more options for the 
students, the better, she said.
Raj Nath, a senior computer sci
ence major at the University of 
Pittsburgh and USInterns.com 
recruiter, has worked extensively at 
attracting students to the Web site 
through postering. USInterns.com 
even sponsored the Pitt Crew team.

Mayor's ProposalProposed Sourco or Funding Grand Total: $80.5 Million
Mike Zimmer/Dossier Design Editor
The Main Street proposal calls for 12.5 percent of the funding to come from 
public sources such as tax increment financing projects. Approximate onefifth of the Mayors Marketplace plan utilizes public subsidies.
MAIN STREET, from page L6 
obviously necessary to work within 
building codes to bring older build
ings up to todays standards.
The Main Street proposal incor
porated several key ambitions of 
downtown. Main Street wants the 
trip to town to become an event 
again with special marketing and 
promotional events, such as tech
nologically enhanced storefronts. 
The idea of interactive windowshopping played heavily into Main 
Streets quality of life issues. Main 
Street beleaguered the point that 
the proverbial little things would 
create an environment conducive to 
a viable Fifth and Forbes corridor. 
The program also included a hous
ing component. Hoping to capital
ize on bright college minds, Main 
Street wants to provide incentives 
for college graduates to live down
town on the upper floors of the 
existing buildings. The loft space 
created by the departure of small 
industry which once dominated the 
upper stories of Pittsburgh provides 
ample opportunity not only for 
housing, and other projects.
In order to open the upper floors, 
building owners would be provided 
with up to $75,000 of the total cost 
of the project. Loft housing devel
opers would be eligble to gain 33% 
of the remodeling and adaptive 
reuse costs.
Perhaps the most stunning victo
ry of the night for Main Street pro
ponents came was the announce
ment of a high-tech incubator mall 
development. Utilizing the large 
upper story floor plates of the G.C. 
Murphys and Donahues buildings, 
GT-CDCs plan calls for the inclu
sion of low-rent technology space. 
Furthermore, Necciai and company 
have already reached letters-ofintent with current building owners 
and have spoken to several area 
technology bigwigs. By creating an 
environment conducive to the latenight personalities of the current 
college generation, GT-CDC hopes 
the rest will fall into place.
Mayors Response
GT-CDCs Main Street plan also 
reflected upon the points rich her
itage with a historic walking tour 
program by memorializing the 
buildings in Fifth and Forbes with 
plaques. The restoration between 
120 and 150 buildings would be 
financed by owners who would 
gain 50% matching funds. Despite 
the obvious uproar created by Main 
Street, the question remains 
whether an incremental approach 
can be successful.
While Main Street advocates are 
concnered about the sustainability 
of the project, Marketplace propo
nents argue otherwise.
Of course there is a great deal of 
risk in this project. But, what hap
pens if we dont try this at all?, pon
dered Mayors spokesman Doug 
Root.
He continued, We need to create 
the amenities young people are 
looking for in a city and stop the 
population drain.
The Mayors office primary con
cerns reside in four areas: office 
space and worker presence, the cul
tural, retial, and recreation ameni
ties of the Point.
The Mayor feels the only way to 
make downtown a place where 
someone wants to live is by secur
ing this type of development.
One of the most interesting parts 
of the Main Street proposal didnt 
come during the meeting, but hours 
before at a press conference where 
Mayor Murphy announced a new 
housing component to be inserted 
into Marketplace. Marketplace 
would include 260 housing units 
constructed by Lincoln Properties. 
$21 million in financing would be 
needed for the project, said 
Murphy. Of it, between $3 and $5 
million would come from the pub
licly funded Pittsburgh 
Development Fund and another 
$1.5 million would be created 
through tax increment financing. 
Most of the loan would come from 
payments made by Lincoln for their 
part in the construction of North 
Shore apartments.
While the orignal plan didnt call 
for housing, the Mayors office 
eased the concerns of the 
Downtown Planning Collaborative 
belief of the need for housing.
We were understanding that the 
Penn-Liberty district and other 
areas were more desirable places to 
livebecause of their riverviews, 
unlike Fifth and Forbes, said Root.
Financing
Marketplace at Fifth and Forbes 
would cost approximately $480.5 
million. Unlike other publicly-sub
sidized projects, Marketplace 
includes a substaintial contribution 
from develop Urban Retail 
Properties (URP). URP has pledged 
$169 million of its own money and 
an additional $195 million from 
their tenants. Nevertheless, 
Marketplace includes over $100 
million in public funding. Critics 
are leery of the plan given the 
return rate on government invest
ment. Some estimates have the 
amount of new tax revenues at a 
paltry $180,000. However, the idea 
of future economic prosperity 
remains strong in the minds of pro
ject proponents.
Marketplace estimates the cost 
of acquisition and related expens
es at $78 million. Despite promis
es from public officials to resolve 
property disputes amicably, mer
chants and some building owners 
have threatened to use court pro
ceedings to prevent the taking of 
their land through eminent 
domain. The city has only taken 
one property through eminent 
domain in the past eight years. 
URP has also pledged $5 million to 
a facade renovation and restora
tion program.
One of the key factors in the suc
cess of the Marketplace plan is 
parking. URP plans to demolish two 
city blocks in order to build under
ground parking and construct a 
department store in one block and a 
movie cinema and shops in the 
sceond block.
Other transportation issues have 
tied directly into additional parking 
including downtown busing circu
lation patterns, and South Side and 
North Side issues. Even water taxis 
have entered the discussion at the 
Downtown Planning Collaborative 
meetings.
While Main Street calls for $32 
million in public funding, almost all 
builds from monies approved for 
use under the Mayors proposal. A 
$10 million state grant has been 
given allocated from Pennsylvania 
Governor Tom Ridge, but not for 
Main Street. Additionally, Main
Street uses the same tax increment 
financing packages as Marketplace,.
As Main Street doesnt include 
any demolition or building acquisf-' 
tions, the cost of the entire project 
is signficantly lower. With the pri
vate investment of the Main Street 
package, building owners can. 
obtain tax credits to sell to other 
individuals. Up to $20 million in, 
facade renovation are available in 
tax credits.
Both programs utilized federal1 
fudning for infrastructure improve-'- 
ments through the FederalTransportation Improvement1- 
Program.
Main Street critics charge that1 
the funding of the development is 
not yet secured and the incremental-7 
approach leads to a fragmenteddowntown revitalization project:- 
which will continue to foster a poor 
retail environment. The Mayor is 
also concerned that no downtown - 
has ever incorporated a Main Street 
program.
Downtown has been in a spiral!' 
We cant afford to wait another ' 
10-15 years with the Main Street' 
approach, stated Root.
One of Main Streets biggest suc
cess stories is Pittsburghs South 
Side. While vacant storefronts had 
approached extremely high num1 
bers, the current vacancy rate i;; 
only 7% percent. Despite the eco* 
nomic betterment of the communi*" 
ty, little exists in the upscale retails  
ers and national chains that a 
downtown flagship demands, is 1 
Nevertheless, Main Street is confi
dent it can exist in the meantime.
Public officials and ordinary citizens alike can agree on the high risk 1 
of publicly financed retail projects.T
Dean of the Heinz School of 
Public Policy and ManagementMark Kamlet, stated Generally" 
theyre not the best return on aninvestment compared to those that 
create jobs.
Kamlet added that when a sub! 
stantial amount of outside funding 
exists, then a public complement 
may be acceptable.
Nevertheless, taxpayers and fis-, 
cal conservatives have wondered 
whether public investment is effec
tive in retail developments.
Several local real estate analysts 
have cautioned that the retail boom , 
in the region that has existed in the. 
suburbs will eventually slow. Retail' 
traditionally doesnt pay as well as' 
other jobs. For example, in. 
Homestead, the county helped 
finance the construction of a strip 
mall, but the hourly rate of working 
at McDonalds doesnt compare to 
the steel mill jobs which existed 
only one decade earlier.
The recent news of the Lazarus . 
sales figures also brings into ques; 
tion the effectiveness of public subT". 
sidies. The company failed to reach', 
a $41 million sales mark, falling. 
$20 million short, meaning theyt 
will not have to pay rent in the fiv^, 
year old stand-alone structure. If 
Lazarus reaches $41 million, it will  
pay $60,000, but that figure jumps 
substantially with increases in 
gross revenues. The Lazarus down
town store cost the public $48 mil-.; 
lion. Of course, Lazarus must still  
pay taxes and wages to its employ-2 
ees. Local politicians are defending < 
the project, stating it will achieve 
success only when the critical mass . 
is created with the addition of 
Marketplace at Fifth and Forbes.
The Mayor has been in conversa. 
tions with Lazarus parent corpora-; ; 
tion, Federated Department Stores,' 
in an attempt to improve the stores 
position.
Kamlet doesnt discount the need.' 
to have a vibrant downtown and 
conceeds that it is very important to: 
the region. However, he compares . 
it to the the chicken or the egg the
ory. Which way do you bring in the 
people? he questioned.
Although the Dean wouldnt nec
essarily classify the downtown as. 
blighted, he feels it is run-down. 
There can be justifications iri: 
blighted areas for the city to be! 
involved, he argued, citing the: 
new Home Depot in East Liberty. \,
He added that the government 
involvement can be improve the 
quality of a distressed neighbor; 
hood. \
However, Kamlet like other pub^ 
lie servants state, the future of the 
region rests with the new economy: 
Perhaps more important than retail, 
development is creating a climate 
favorable to technology companies . 
and startups; and unfortunately; ; 
that doesnt mean the weather.

Heres What Student Senate Did This Semester
CAMPUS
 Put PAT bus schedules at CMU stops
 Put outdoor basketball courts on the top level of the parking garage
 Conferred with Housing to stop solicitation in the dorms
 Hired a student to compile a local healthcare database for student use
 Working to put quick-stop email terminals in the UC
 Revising the poster policy to regulate unauthorized postering in academ
ic buildings.
 Consolidated the UC room reservation system for student use, waiting for 
the administration to implement the online module for their current soft
ware.
ACADEMIC
 Halted the proposed OLR toggling system. (Students would alternate 
between increasingly early afternoon and morning times rather than slowly 
moving through the entire cycle a slot or so at a time) Thus change would
have caused some students to only have early'slots when registering for 
spring classes or only when registering for fall classes.
 Worked to get a student representative on the CSW curriculum commit
tee for next year & gave feedback on possible changes. Larger changes are 
likely to take effect next year.
 Improving campus clusters: Cluster Policies will be posted on the walls. 
Feedback was given as to the new cluster equipment for next year and 
other changes we hope to get implemented.
 Recommended change in the University Final Examination Policy-the 
addition of "dead day," when professors who are giving exams during finals 
week are not permitted to have a major test, project, portfolio, paper, etc 
due the last day of classes before finals. Expected to be presented for
1 Faculty Seijate next semester.

We ordered hummus to start, but 
it mysteriously never showed up 
(although it did appear on our bill, 
conveniently enough). Without 
hummus, we had to turn to the 
bread, which was not exactly a hard
ship considering that we got huge 
amounts of both pita rounds and an 
egg bread that tasted an awful lot 
like challah. Other than the missing 
hummus, service was reasonably 
prompt and friendly. They were even 
smart enough to leave a whole pitch
er of Diet Coke on our table once 
they saw that we were hardly past 
the salad and already on our second 
round of drink refills.
Suzies salad, generously sprin
kled with bits of feta cheese, tastes 
so good you momentarily forget its a 
salad. Among main courses, pites - 
assorted fillings inside phyllo dough 
- are some of the most interesting. 
Spanakopita, with spinach and 
cheese, tastes rich and eggy, 
although the portion could be larger. 
Its a very painless way to get your 
daily dose of iron. Exohiko, with 
lamb, is also good and filling.
Other dishes are also memorable. 
Chicken Apollo featured a mush
room filling and a creamy mustard 
sauce. The sauce tasted a littie too 
generically creamy and not mustardy enough for me, but the flavors
did go well together, and the chicken 
itself was tender. Roast lamb was 
also succulent, with a tasty sauce.
I got entirely too excited when I 
heard that one of the dessert choices 
was homemade chocolate cheese
cake. But it was worth it - my slice 
had an intense flavor and grainy tex
ture that raised it above mere mortal 
cheesecakes. The galatoboroureko 
looked like a Greek egg roll, with 
sweet custard wrapped in a crisp 
pastry crust and the whole thing 
soaked in honey Of course, theres 
baklava as well.
Your parents will definitely be 
impressed. If youre lucky, theyll 
even pay for your share of the meal.

The Legend of 1900
Thursday, May 4
Well, here goes my final stab at this column for the year 
and I know that you and the members (ha ha) of my fan club 
are going to be very distraught until next fall. Maybe you 
should find yourself a hobby, like walking on hot coals, col
lecting cork, or Muppet hunting.
I debated not even mentioning the movies this week and 
instead pushing my politics (girl power!), religious beliefs 
(Loch Ness Monster), and opinions on general matters like 
music (Dave Matthews, please please go away) on you. But, 
since Im such a nice guy, Ill clue you in that The Legend of 
1900 is the story of a man (Pulp Fiction's Tim Roth) born 
aboard a ship called the Virginian on January 1, 1900. 
Known to his friends simply as 1900, he quickly wins fame 
for his prodigal piano-playin skillz. Furthermore, because of 
a fear of technology that puts Radiohead to shame, 1900 
refuses to ever leave The Virginian.
Alright, I cant resist one more opinion: how bad was Star 
Wars: Episode I? George Lucas needs to check out The Matrix 
again.

Man on the Moon
Friday, May 5
First of all, I would just like to admit to everyone that I had 
no clue that R.E.M.s 1992 hit Man on the Moon is about 
Andy Kaufman, and neither did you. I also did not know 
that the Polices Roxanne is about a prostitute and 
Sisqos The Thong Song is actually about jousting. I did, 
however, know that Santanas Smooth is all about being a 
pretty stupid song.
Back to the lecture at hand  lets talk about the Jim Carrey 
flick. This biopic about wacky but hilarious anti-comedian 
Kaufman was a critical favorite but not the box-office or Oscar 
champ some (fools) expected. Not for lack of effort on the 
part of its star, who famously stayed in character between 
takes. This makes me want to be an actor - that way if I act 
like a jackass or get worked by some girl, I can blame it on the 
character (Andre the Giant) Im currently portrayiig.
If you have any idea what I should be writing instead of this 
100 percent pointless and wasteful sentence which is clearly 
a filler, please let me know ASAP.

The Hurricane
Saturday, May 6
I
Denzel Washington scored his fourth Oscar norrmation 
(Cry Freedom, Glory, Malcolm X) for his portrayal of wrongly 
convicted boxer and Bob Dylan fan Rubin Hurricane Carter 
in this film based on Carters autobiography.
So apparently some people complained about this movie 
stretching the truth a bit and not being a true storj. These 
people, in classic human fashion, have the intelligence of 
cheesecake. For goodness sake, read! Its based on a true 
story  its a movie, not a docu-freakin-mentary. If you 
think all movies based on true stories are totally kccurate, 
then you should probably give me all of your money before 
you do something crazy with it like buy a ticket to a Phish 
concert.
Anyway, Ive heard pretty much all positive things about 
The Hurricane. I reviewed the CD here in The Tartan a few 
months ago, and thought it was quality. Speaking of quality, 
has anyone ever heard Double Dutch Bus by Frankie 
Smith? Or Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash, for that matter? 
Why not? Explain.

Sunday, May 7
On the off chance that you didnt get your fill of ridiculous

Ferox came to town, this Sundays feature is 1979s pr. 
Butcher, M.D. Known in Italian as Zombi Holocaust, which 
roughly translates to Who lets these people make movies, 
anyway?, Dr. Butchers cast consists entirely of cannibals, 
zombies, mad doctors, victims, and, from what Ive reqd, 
naked women.
At this point, I am getting a little bit concerned for all those 
Italian filmmakers. All the Italian movies I find by poking 
around on the Internet appear to have the word Cannibal 
in the title. Frankly, Im a little bit afraid to rent Life is 
Beautiful.
Well, Im feeling a bit ill now. Time for me to go. Enjoy your

Hungry hearts beat strongly for Springsteen
CONCERT REVIEW
Reviewer finds Greek restaurant to be god-like
RESTAURANT REVIEW
by Seth Mandel
Managing Editor
Its not every day that you 
get to witness a rock n roll 
exorcism. But last 
Wednesday night, Bruce 
Springsteen and the E 
;Street Band successfully 
proved the miraculous 
power of rock n roll as they 
drove away the dark forces 
that consume our lives. 
Thoughts of class projects, 
papers, and exams vanished 
as the Boss and his crew 
brought a little bit of New 
Jersey to Pittsburgh during 
their two-night engagement 
at the Mellon Arena.
The excitement of the 
evening was set as 
Springsteen took the stage 
asking, Are you ready for 
me, people? Are you ready 
for a meeting in the town 
tonight? with a gospel-like 
rage. There was energy all 
iaround and it was clear that 
people were ready for the 
Boss and the E Street Band, 
including Max Weinberg, 
Patti Scialfa, and the big 
man himself, Clarence 
Clemons.
The forceful The Tie That 
Binds and Adam Raised A 
Cain set a tone of power to 
be enhanced by an amazing 
version of Two Hearts, 
which included part of the 
Marvin Gaye song, It Takes 
Two. An explosive perfor
mance of Darlington 
County led into a slower 
part of the set, which fea
tured Youngstown as its 
highlight.
Just as some people start
ed to take a seat, the pace 
was increased again with 
the forceful concert favorite 
Murder Incorporated that 
effectively used lighting to 
contribute to the songs 
dark subject matter. That 
darkness would fade quick
ly and dramatically as the 
house lights came on for 
"Badlands, which obliter
ated any sense of intensity 
that seemed to have existed 
thus far. Those not yet 
standing were forced from 
their seats to sing along to 
this popular tune.
_ Springsteen then master
fully played off of the rage 
he inspired in the crowd
with an incredible rendition 
of Out in the Street, a 
song which did not appear 
to be as well-known to some 
in the audience. It wasnt 
too long until those unfa
miliar with the tune caught 
on to at least the Oh Oh. 
Oh Oh. Oh part. This song 
has other great lyrics, how
ever, and some lines 
seemed especially appropri
ate, such as all day youve 
been working that hard 
line, now tonight youre 
gonna have a good time.
Tenth Avenue
Freezeout, Springsteens 
narrative about the forma
tion of the E Street Band, 
followed the pattern of non
stop energy. As usual, the 
Boss took time in the mid
dle of this groove to intro
duce the members of the EStreet Band. Throughout 
the introductions, he con
tinued to use a preachy 
gospel tone to praise the 
power and glory of rock n 
roll. As Springsteen spoke 
of the Ministry of Rock n 
Roll, it was clear that fans 
would heed his call to testi
fy to mystical forces of the 
music. It was both a spirited 
and spiritual part of the 
show that culminated with 
Springsteen deliberately 
collapsing on the ground 
from the intensity. I lost 
track of the fact that this 
man is older than both of 
my parents, as his stamina 
showed no genuine signs of 
wavering.
Things eventually did 
slow down a bit during a 
part of the set that includ
ed one of Springsteens 
newer songs, The Ghost of 
Tom Joad. While many 
concert-goers chose to use 
that time to take trips to the 
restroom and grab a few 
more beers, the mellower 
side of The Boss was by no 
means disappointing.
Next came Jungleland, 
which was a certain high
light. It was an impressive 
performance of a song that 
demonstrates all that is 
great about Springsteen  
the drama, the excitement, 
the power. Clemons sax 
solo on this tune was espe
cially impressive. The Big 
Mans phenomenal stage 
presence throughout the
courtesy oi neai rresion
Bruce Springsteen came and rocked to a packed crowd at the Mellon Arena both last Tuesday 
and Wednesday night as part of a reunion tour with the E Street Band.
night proved why he is such 
a crowd favorite.
An energetic version of 
Spirit in the Night came 
next, continuing the trend 
of thought-provoking mas
terpieces.
To those fans only famil
iar with mainstream hits 
such as Born in the USA, 
Dancing in the Dark, and 
Glory Days, the show may 
have been a bit disappoint
ing, as those and other pop
ular hits were excluded. 
Many concert-goers
appeared satiated, however, 
when the popular Hungry 
Heart was performed dur
ing the first encore. Clearly, 
the notion that everybody 
has a hungry heart was 
well-known, as Springsteen 
paused to allow the soldout crowd to sing the cho
rus in unison.
The essential Born .to 
Run recreated and 
enhanced the Badlands 
atmosphere with the house 
lights on and almost the 
entire arena standing, 
singing along, and pound
ing their fists in the air at 
the appropriate moments. 
Thunder Road, another 
essential, was performed 
next and was simply divine.
If I Should Fall Behind, 
a poignant song which fea
tures vocals from the vari
ous band members, could 
have easily ended the show, 
but Springsteen pushed out 
another two songs to signif
icantly surpass the three 
hour point before calling it 
a night.
And it was most certainly 
a night unlike any other. 
Springsteen achieved his 
goal of conducting a rock 
n roll exorcism and now I, 
too, am ready to testify. For 
I have been a witness to the 
power and the glory of the 
Ministry of Rock n Roll.

The Boiler Room Grade: C+ Reviewed February 21
Overall, this is a fairly average film.... Like many films, it had the potential to be a 
great motion picture, but settled for mediocrity instead. I would recommend it to people interested in an unusual tale about the inner workings of a corrupt brokerage firm, but would not 
recommend it to someone who expects a fast-paced dramatic thriller.

.^i/Vbat if there were a new 
movie worth seeing?
..What if you could" change 
fehespast? Well, if you are John 
ufiivan and this is the world 
oi-Frequency, you would be 
able to  sort of.
, Because of a series of unex
plained phenomena, John is 
able to talk to his father, 
frank, via ham radio. But this 
js no ordinary conversation. 
iJohn, living in 1999, is talking 
j:o(^rank, who is living in 
|1969- After a period of shock, 
they recognize the truth of the 
Situation. As it turns out, they 
meet just days before what 
^vdtfld have been Franks 
Peath.
! Esank is a firefighter, so 
danger is nothing new to him. 
At^rst, he doesnt know what 
f:o make of Johns story, but in 
^he^end he follows Johns 
advice and lives. 
Unfortunately, there is a prob
lem? Staying alive has iinforeseqjr consequences, indirectly 
causing an infamous serial 
killer to live when he would 
have otherwise died. Whats 
more, Johns mother is among 
the new victims. The rest of 
the movie is spent trying to 
rectify this unfortunate side 
effect.
Frequency is a fun, enjoyable 
movie, packing so much 
drama and suspense into two 
hours, that even the most 
diehard fans of thd genre will 
be,.impressed. And -when it 
comes to emotion, Frequency 
as second-to-none. The fathersonrelationship presented is 
genuine and true. It has 
everything the average viewer 
could want in a motion
piottire.
i 
Frequency avoids the trap 
set by its implausible plot by 
making no real attempt to 
explain it. This is a wise 
choice, as the plot is insignifi
cant to the film and really 
could not be explained any
way, hence the term unex
plained phenomenon. Thus, 
the viewer is free to suspend 
their disbelief and enjoy the 
movie.
Unfortunately, Frequency 
has numerous flaws in addi
tion to its obvious strengths. 
The first 20 minutes are poor
ly done. The actors deliver 
stilted dialogue without any 
emotion or truth to what they 
say. After a while, this prob
lem disappears, leading me to 
believe that the beginning 
could have been fixed if the 
director would have given it 
some more takes.
Then there is the problem of
underdeveloped subplots. 
For example, Johns girlfriend 
walks out on him near the 
start of the movie. While the 
scene does serve some pur
pose, and while the idea is 
revisited briefly, director 
Gregory Hobilt should have 
either developed it more fully 
or left it out completely. A 
half-developed idea is worse 
than none at all.
Returning to Frequencys 
strengths, the acting is 
superb. James Caviezel does 
an excellent job playing John. 
His role involves a maturing 
process, not something easy to 
demonstrate by any means, 
and he is able to pull it off 
with apparent ease. 
Furthermore, a subtle change 
in his personality arises after 
his father survives the fire. 
Having a father during his 
youth has improved Johns
outlook on life, and Caviezel 
enacts that change perfectly. 
Dennis Quaid, as Frank, plays 
his part effectively and gen
uinely. There is a real boyish 
charm in his character, cap
tured well by Quaids style. 
The supporting cast members 
play their simple roles1 with 
competence; no one steals the 
spotlight, but no one drops 
the ball either.
In conclusion, Frequency is 
sure to entertain as long as 
one doesnt get hung up on the 
framework of the plot. The 
emotional drama is second-tonone and the suspense keeps 
the viewer interested at all 
times. The acting, especially 
by James Caviezel, is fantastic. 
Mediocre direction is only 
thing holding Frequency back 
from greatness. I would rec
ommend it to movie fans of all 
types. B
(Left to Right) Noah Emmerich, Michael Cera, and James Caviezel star in the sci-fi film, Frequency.

MYYYY uJ/M/t/MYFunky the bat was a sneaky batstard,
"Oh ho, while the human is away the bat 
will play," is what I heard him say that day, 
bearing a mischevious grin stinking of sin, 
as he poked a joke at my expense from 
across the Atlantic, utilizing my semantic.
Well I have my ways of finding out, like 
my mother knew when I was in the cookie 
jar. So I decided to return the favor to my 
nocturnal friend. But it's damn hard, out 
here. I tried to render a 3-d bat but I can't 
use 3-d software to save my soul, or cracker.The Phatmaster

like \ ~i ,'f some
sort of
toxic plague, but worse, because 
it seems driven by a single 
insatiable desire to destroy me, 
to tear apart every strand of 
continuity that holds me together, that uniquely defines my very character, rendering me 
a quivering lump of arbitrary 
and entirely useless goo...
longer rely upon
myself.
I shall seek outside guidance. 
Statistically speaking, the 
first person who passes by will 
give me the insight of the average populace, the modem yeoman, the contemporary 
proletariat.
Lately, I've been finding myself using the word "arbitrary" ...There! I was about to say it again! I was going to say 
"arbitrarily often."
Whats
Zeichr
mean"
NEWLY . 
REVIVED \ 
ENTHUSIASM!So then I looked for some clip-art of a bat 
and the best I could do was this image, 
file://KU 158_6/Goodies/Bilder/Bilcher. It was 
in color and it really loses its kazaam in this 
simple line art format, so I guess you could 
say Funky got the last laugh. Hahahahaha.
So I looked around the german computer 
and found Adobe Dimensions, sounds 3-d. 
Well my best bet was to draw a sphere 
and some rectangles for wings, but then 
I didn't know how to render my new 
creation, and besides it wasn't quite bat.
Restate my assumptions. 
The average human is 
roughly as intelligent as 
a walnut.
The only stance worth 
defending is the empty stance.
There's always time for more anime.
You! Yes, you'll do!
I'm having a problem. I can't 
find myBelf! I can no longer 
trust anything I do, anything 
I think, anything I feel!
You must help me! What do you do when you've lost 
contact with yourself?

The Final Chapter: Still orificeless, Esqueala went home in 
despair and soaked herself in tequila until she passed out. All 
of a sudden, a giant stuffed pig with wings appeared in front 
of her. "Esqueala," said the pig, Im the orifice fairy and Im 
here to grant you an orifice." Oink! squealed Esqueala. I 
cant believe it. My life now has meaning." Hours later,
Esqueala woke up to a strange new sensation. The tequila had 
flowed inside her brand-new orifice and, for the first time, she 
could actually taste it. She began to drink it up.

PITTSBURGH, 4 TIMES, REAL, REAL SHORT
by Anne Ray
"... A Bad Situation: film at 11 ..."
Pittsburgh News Does Its Job, Working For You, the Community
1. Their Names
Nina Pineda. Sounds Latina. Mexican, maybe Spanish? A pol
ished Asian woman.
Darieth Chisholm. A truly Norman name. Visigoths. Huns. 
Vandals. Anglican, perhaps? Irish? Nope, African American woman.
Five different Steve's. Yes. Because every man in Pittsburgh 
is named Steve. That's what they want us to think, maybe.
Newiin Archinal. Dunno.
Fedko. A Slavic sports anchor. Sounds Slavic, and he looks 
Slavic. The high school cheerleaders make posters of this guy 
when his camera crews come to tape their football games. A black
haired man wearing a skinny tie and a speech bubble reading The 
Fedko Zone.
2. The stories
At 11, Darieth Chisholm starts to tell us the story of an armed 
robbery at the 7-11 on Centre Ave. A graphic flashes up behind 
her, a drawing that looks like a court sketch, depicting a hooded 
man holding a gun toward the viewer, and a stylized graphic of a 
line of Police tape which reads Police Line Do Not Cross. Next to 
this picture are the words, A Bad Situation.Later we think of 
other bad situations: spilled milk, a sick puppy, mass genocide,
The Boston Strangler. Then we realize Darieth's power.
Newiin tells us about the woman with the double-chin whose 
Christmas presents were stolen right out from under her tree. And 
the woman who had toys stolen off of her murdered daughter's 
grave.
A popular local Spanish restaurant, Mallorca, gets smacked 
with a health department violation, and one of the Steve's takes us 
right there, right into the kitchen. The owner drags him around by 
the lapel showing him where they cleaned up, installed a new 
refrigerator unit, shooed away the rats.
Another night, a different Steve, or maybe the same one, tells 
us of the city employee who's not doing her job. He stands in the 
parking lot, confronting her, microphone cord tangled around his 
feet, and says, Are you doing your job? She answers, holding a 
set of dangling keys and a Super-Big-Gulp-sized soda pop from 
Wendy's. Yes.
But later, Steve says, we catch her outside her house, in the 
middle of the afternoon -- gasp -- not at work. He runs up the lawn 
like a war correspondent at Normandy and she tells him she's 
picking her granddaughter up from the dentist. We'll keep you 
posted. Back to you, Steve.
3. The Hot Tips
Call if you've heard about any people siphoning gas out of 
their neighbors lawnmower. Or if you've seen any city officials 
slacking off. Or call and say, "My husband just got home from 
work. Are you writing this down, Steve?

Seven
a
o11s
By Jess Young
Sunset air of Tuesday smells 
like crayons. I walk through 
cornflower and periwinkle,
dredging shoes through melted wax. 
Tuesday sunset brings back first
box memories. Seven color 
funpack. Simple names like red 
and black and green, enough
color for a rainbow, a family 
picture, a dragon. Seventeen 
years brought fifty-seven
more colorsa built-in sharpener. 
Those first seven hide behind 
purple mountain majesty
burnt Sienna and rain forest; 
questions of patriotism, politics, 
the environment. Tonight, a decision.
I pull out the box of sixty-four 
find red, blue, orange, yellow 
green, black, brown 
and melt the rest in Tuesday air.

but thfe girl let me have as many 
refills as I wanted. She let me
sit itu&be cornerJxehindfrny 
newspaper until the sun turned
orange and fell behind the window 
sill. Her hair stood tall and pointed,
her toenails pink, her lips thin.
And when the rainstorm came
and washed away my courage, 
for just a second, she smiled at me.

Sharon spreads out in her mother's tub,
letting me watch her wash
her body with rose-colored soap.
She cups handfuls of suds onto budding breasts.
...I am suddenly reminded of you, as I
stand in a small shower
drying off the back of a woman I know.
I slide the towel around her waist 
and thread it between her legs;
I bend down to wipe clean the shins, 
the blushing skin of the feet.
Sharon, I remember your blue eyes 
in that white tile room, and the wet shine 
of your skin. The tiniest gestures accumulate...
She asks me to turn away
before she pushes her knees against the sides
of the tub and glides the washcloth past
her belly, into a patch of twirling hairs
that arrived and will stay,
like first snow in a northern country.

A Woman s Best Friend
1.
Seven-years-old, I was sick of people.
A limping alley cat was my best friend
until one morning I found her dead 
on my doorstep. I poked her with a stick.
2.
My grandparents housed a stray 
in their boiler room. I was not allowed
to touch it. I slammed the door shut 
on its tail to hear it screech.
3. 
My brother and I tortured 
my stepbrothers cat with pellet guns.
Within weeks it was suicidal. We heard 
the thud when it jumped off the refrigerator.
4.
After the backyard funeral 
I developed an allergy to cats.
Ten years later I adopt a hairless.
I am teaching it to shave my legs.

way things used to be. i'm no longer your "lil" that 
survived on blind-faith. i can't allow myself to fall 
prey to losing sleep and appetites and me. i want to 
surprise myself, to be inspired, to inspire others, 
thank you and i thank you for what you gave me. 
for a while we walked in die garden of innocence and 
virtue together, and you've taught me to be strong, to 
learn to take some hard blows and to survive, to love 
and be loved, maybe the circumstances around these 
lessons hurt, but i am a better person for it now. own 
now i'm back on my own making my own mistakes, 
i'm me again, no longer part of a couple or a 
subsidiary, but i'm learning and growing and i'm free, 
and it pains me to see you not letting or wanting me 
to develop, become my own person and experiment 
at my own free-will, i wish you could be happy for me. 
this new found me. this rebirth.

die, things die, animals die but love never dies, needs and i don't 
need people telling me: "it's for the best." "you can do better." "this 
will make you a stronger person." i don't need your calls or your 
offerings of friendship, i don't need you to check up on me to see how 
i am. i don't want anything, all i need is for you to tell me you love me 
again, and then i'll be complete. 4 months somewhere along the 
way, i've accepted that we're no longer together, you opened and 
closed me like flower petals open and close to the sun. and i thirst for 
the power, the energy, the strength you gave me. your smile, the way 
you held me at the waist, the way you called me "lil." i thought i 
needed you to make myself whole, never really knowing that the seeds 
of beauty came from within myself, that my life wasn't controlled by 
you or love or some outside catalyst, new love i don't need the 
words i love you. i don't need lies, deceit, and hidden agendas, i don't 
need to wonder what it means to be complete, perhaps i've never 
really learned to love myself the way a baby does, to ask for what i 
want, to know what i need, to look after myself, instead of her or him 
or you or them, mean i want to know what it is to mean things 
again, to look at things from a new set of eyes, to take each day, each 
moment as if it were all new. to skip over sidewalk chalk and taste 
mexican food, to run through haunted houses squealing and laughing, 
to embrace all the wonders that i used to take for granted, join and 
you can join me if you want or leave me be. but i can't go back to the

You'd never heard the Grateful Dead, but I met you at the candlelight vigil they held in Jerry Garcias memory, one night in Bronson Park. I saw you dripping 
your name in wax on a picnic table, and recognition slapped me in the face, and I said to you: Your name's Larry? I didnt know that."
You turned, seemingly unstartled, and gave a slow wink. Didnt know me? That's no surprise to me. I sure dont know you. How old are you? Fourteen?"
Eighteen," I told you, my heart slamming against my ribs. This was my chance to confront you, to demand why you stole my friend one night five years ago. I 
look young for my age."
Want to hang out?" you asked, passing your fingertips idly back and forth through the candle flame. I guessed you were twenty-seven. You confirmed.
We walked to your place, summer night breeze brushing our legs, cool. I slid my fingers along the pearl handle of the butterfly knife I carried in my pocket, clear
ly remembering my father's warning that a knife is an unreliable weapon, that I'd need to be dangerously near my enemy for it to be effective. I couldn't stop myself. All I 
could remember was Jennys face, her nose bleeding and running at the same time as she cried. I was armed; I was dangerous; I was any match for you. I was stupid, 
and I knew it.
You asked me with a sidelong glance why I approached you. You reminded me of someone," I said in a low voice, my confidence flickering like a lighter almost 
out of fluid. You pulled out a cigarette and began to smoke, and I recognized the brand, the same kind youd smoked back then. I did not say, Youre the man who raped 
my friend, I remember you."
You told me there is a certain romance about candlelight, that you saw all those little wicks lighting up the bronze children in the fountain and you just had to 
ask for a little white stub already misshapen with melting, even though you didn't know who Jerry Garcia was and didn't bother to ask. You, romantic-my insides curdled.
Climbing the half-crumbled stairs to your room above the travel agency on West Michigan, you said to me in a way that was not menacing, You got a boyfriend?"
No," I said defiantly-a bit fearful of you.
Youre not a lesbian, are you?" you said incredulously.
I laughed hesitantly, wondering which answer was better. No." You just gave me that sidelong glance again and shrugged and unlocked the door to your place 
and offered me a seat on the bottomed-out sofa. I wished I had a gun instead of a knife, because then I could make you cringe from across the room. With the knife, I 
would have to wait until you put the moves on me, and that thought pulled the hairs on my limbs into goose bumps but I didnt leave. It was your fault that Jenny stopped 
talking to me, stopped talking to anyone, that she dropped out, after getting pregnant by some drop-out jerk I told her to stay away from, but what did I know? I wasn't 
her best friend anymore. I'd stopped being her friend that night.
I didnt even think that maybe you had a knife. Or a gun. I saw your chipped baseball bat learning in the corner, and you saw me looking and took out your soft
ball photos. I studied your mild face and long-lashed eyes, your scruffy jeans, your hint of a dimple when you smiled. I studied your apartment, the paint peeling off the 
ceiling, a picture of your mother on the windowsill, a bookshelf on the opposite wall. You offered me a glass of Kool-Aid - Red" you said brightly - and I said, No thanks, 
Im fine."
What about you?" you asked. Do you like the Grateful Dead?"
I shook my head and remembered the night five years ago that you told Jenny you had a ticket to the Bryan Adams concert that youd sell her cheap, if she came 
back to your place and got it, and when she got there you offered her beer instead of Kool-Aid. Don't go," I'd said and sat miserably in the alley, my face pressed against 
my knees, until she reappeared. You'd threatened to kill us if we ever told on you. We never did. What did we know? We were stupid. I was still stupid.
Nice place you've got," I said, nearly choking on my words.
Thanks," you said, It's not much, but I try to keep it clean." You brushed a bit of dust off the bookshelf as you spoke. You, finicky - my insides churned, con
fused by what I saw as your contradictions.
What about you?" I asked. Do you have a girlfriend?"
No" you said, and I'm not gay, either." You paused. You looking?"
I chilled with the vague expectation that any moment you would cross the room and grab my wrists and pin them behind my head before I had the chance to 
reach for the knife. I wedged my fingers into my pocket as I said firmly, No. I just wondered." You shrugged and smiled and shrugged again. You were innocent. You 
were charming. I thought about asking you if youd ever had a girlfriend, and if shed known you raped little girls, and if youd ever gotten anyone other than Jenny.
I didn't, though-a little scared, more uncertain. Because maybe you werent the same man, because you were nice, because you were interesting, because you hadnt 
attacked me, because maybe you were rehabilitated, because maybe the thing with Jenny was just a mistake, and I was beginning to relax, and I took my hand out of my 
pocket again, and when you said, I'm sorry I cant get anything for you. You want to read some poetry?" I stood up to look at the bookshelf with you, to scan spines that 
said Langston Hughes and Carroll and Yeats.
You pulled out a dog-eared volume and offered to read, but I glanced at my watch shook my head and said, truthfully and with shreds of disappointment, I should 
go. I meeting friends at Sammys Samwiches soon." I started for the door, not quite willing to turn my back toward you but my legs sturdy, and you crossed the room and 
opened it for me with a gentleman flourish. Thanks," I said.
No problem. You want me to walk with you?" you asked. When I declined, unsure of what was common sense at this point, you said, Well, Im sure you'll be 
fine, a self-assured girl like you." You held the door open for me and said, I'm going back to the park, anyway. Write my last name, too." You laughed, and I smiled, too.
When I left you with the candles and the mourners and the softly amplified Dead, you said, Hey, let's hang out again sometime," and I shrugged and said, Maybe."
I strode off to Sammys by candlelight, crumbling between my fingers a piece of your name Id scraped off the picnic table, feeling the heat of your signature on 
me and the knife cool and heavy in my pocket, hating myself for liking you.

ReplantingThe Dead
Yesterday I stood at the graveyard 
and watched a bulldozer, groaning 
like a forgotten ghost, uproot the dead.
At dinner you passed the milk but not 
the butter and said Perhaps our time is through. 
I just offered you salt.
I struggle over your waist, each touch 
the white tip of a blind man's cane 
discerning the solid curb below.
The graves remain empty. I plant 
my head against your chest, coil patiendy, 
pray for the reaction of soil and water.
by Fiona Tranquada
The night casts its shadows, filtered 
through an oak trees slender arms.
On the bed I sit cross-legged, afraid 
my snores will wake you. The door 
swings open at 3 a.m., the wind rustling 
like a scared rabbit in the garden.

love "wo ai ni." i didn't know if i heard wrong or if it was the payphone i was on or if you 
were just playing around with chinese but you said those words to me, "wo ai ni." and i asked 
you to repeat what you said, pressing the phone to my ear, twisting the cold metal cord around 
my finger, but you said it again, this time in english, "i love you." and as much as i wanted to 
say " i love you too." i couldn't, i didn't know if i loved you. and i never told anyone that i 
loved them before, not even my parents, and if i was going to say it, i was going to do it right, 
and so instead of returning those sweet, beautiful words of endearment, i whispered, "don't say 
that, don't say that if you don't mean it. i don't want to hear it if you don't mean it." i could 
tell you were disappointed, you didn't want to have to assure me that you meant it. i didn't 
really need you to assure me. i knew, no you always hated it when i said "no." maybe that was 
because i never used to say no. in fact, i was the one that was always asking for more, the 
animal in me was still alive while yours was falling asleep, and it amazed me how i could love 
and want someone so much, and you'd laugh and you'd tickle me and you'd look me straight 
in the eye and whisper, "i love you," before you'd kiss me time and time again, and i was happy, 
i loved you. slut but i couldn't help getting scared, i wanted more space, more independence, 
you weren't satisfied, so you went and found someone that wouldn't say "no." and you 
showered her with trinkets and left me late at night for your secret rendezvous, lying to me 
every chance you got. and i never knew, i never lied to you. morals and you criticize my 
ethics and.my morals, you tell me that i'm a bad influence, you say you don't like the person 
i've become, and now that you're on your own, doing the things that you want to: lying, 
cheating, stealing, i see what it is that makes you think you're a better person than me. 
understand and i don't understand how you could become this way. how you can stop 
wanting me. how you can stop saying you love me. why i'm the one that's left all squeezed and 
twisted and empty like a tube of toothpaste, why i'm the one that's waiting for my scabs to fall 
off wishing, hoping, praying that the pain will go away, knowing fully well that the scars will 
always be there, why am i the one left alone in a room to cry on my own after getting hit by 
a car? life gave me a second chance, why can't you? know and all i know is that you loved 
me. i made you so happy at one point that you told me you loved me. it wasn't something 
simple like "i think you're really great." or "i care about you so much." it was "i love you," that 
you said to me almost every day for two years, you loved me! you loved me so much, you told 
me you wanted to marry me. never love doesn't die. say it once and it lives forever, people
