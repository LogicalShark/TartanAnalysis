Mid tbe chilly blasts ot a typical 
winter .day, Carnegies courageous football -warriors downed the We Virginia  University eleven last Saturday - afternoon. vat. Forbes Field lo the tune bf'2G-0. With a running attack, that was as powerful as It was deceptive, with a defense that was Impregnable, and with a streamOf Harpster's beau
tiful passes all combined In one spectacular -trained', combination, 
the Ploid mechine worked its way to another glorious victory. over . another; strong' and formidable "op
ponent" ' /.
. The retuni of Melzlecer and Mefort to tho lineup strengthened the forward wall a great deal, and although Melzlener was forced to quit" early when hie : Injured nose commenced to bleed, he' demon
strated during his short stay that he has lost none of bis old cunning, and will be a tower of strength for next. Snturday's'clash 
against the Irish if the injured - member only permits. Mefort ic his first game'since theDetroit battle proved.again to be oneof

Undaunted however, little Bill lore around right end on the next.play. for another , 22 yards, and then Letzelter dashed off tackle - on the erstwhile famous 'spinner*' the remaining : 30 yards for a touchdown.

There can be no doubt as to hich side won the strike, as the miners were defeated on the moat important points .-of contention ['hey were resisting' all attempts if tbe , mice owners to reduce 
wages and .to . lengthen the hours orkln thocoal mining Industiy, and they were, furtheriiiiofe, dealing, as a unified group of Iajorers with all .mine operators, 'if hey had 'been successful the xelult of the strike would have'been some form of national agreement .between' the nnlon and .the mployere. whlcti woiild 'havgrapplied uf all laborers and employers in' coal Industry. There would probably _ have been .concessions.i.ade by both sides, 'but even with' large concessions from the miners the defeat would not have beea as mple.te as 19 the actual stale of affaire.
The result of the strike is that the mint
