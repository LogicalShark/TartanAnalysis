University Center plans to expand by fall 2016
ALVIN MATHEW 
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon administration hopes to develop 
the University Center into the 
space facing Forbes Avenue 
within the next three years, 
with additions including an 
exercise area for strength 
training, cardio exercise 
rooms, a cycling studio, and a 
multipurpose exercise studio.
A town hall presentation 
was held by the University and 
Cannon Design on Wednesday 
in Rangos 3 to discuss Carnegie Mellons future University 
Center, part of the Universitys 
10-year master plan to expand 
and renovate its facilities. 
Students and faculty attended the meeting, looking 
to learn more about the project and voice their concerns 
and opinions.
According to Associate Director of Athletics Josh Centor, the athletics portion of the 
master plan has three phases. 
The ?rst phase has already 
been completed with the installation of new turf on the 
soccer ?elds a few years ago. 
It has more than doubled occupancy, he said while complimenting the new ?elds. 
The second phase is still in 
progress; the third phase will 
focus on renovations to Skibo 
Gym.
Wednesdays town hall 
meeting focused on the second phase, which Centor describes as meeting the needs 
of the campus community in 
the realm of ?tness and athletics in the future University 
Center. According to the current plan, the renovations will 
change the dynamics of campus by shifting the center of 
the Pittsburgh campus. 
The new addition is expected to include a new ?tness 
center and studio theaters, as 
well as shelf space in the University Center basement.
Ralph Horgan, associate 
vice provost of campus design 
and facility development, noted that the meeting is not the 
?nal product. We want to hear 
from everybody. 
Centor said that the project 
showed a commitment to student experience.
The ?rst level of the University Center addition will 
feature heavy and light free 
weights, strength training, 
service desk, locker rooms, 
and a meeting room.
Centor was a strong advocate for a better weight room. 
Right now, our weight area 
is at the very back end. If you 
want to do serious strength 
training, you cant do it. The 
facility on the ?rst ?oor will 
therefore have newer, heavier 
weights and machinery.
The ?rst ?oor will also 
house a new studio theater.  
Elizabeth Vaughan, director 
of student activities, said that 
the studio theater would be 
multifunctional, to be used for 
dance rehearsals and performances, music concerts, and 
small theater productions. 
Were bursting at the seams 
in terms of rehearsal space, 
Vaughan noted regarding the 
problems currently faced by 
many dance teams and performance groups at the university.

Members of Juntos, a 
cross-cultural service organization, spoke about their experiences volunteering in Nicaragua last Thursday during 
the Tartans Abroad Showcase 
in the University Center.
The student group, which 
focuses on service initiatives 
in Rosa Grande, Nicaragua 
 as well as in Pittsburgh  
recently received a Tartans 
Abroad scholarship, which 
helped members travel to Nicaragua last May.
While there, students took 
part in various communitybuilding projects. In an educational initiative, Juntos 
members developed multiple workshops on how to 
use Microsoft Of?ce, which 
they shared with Nicaraguan 
professors. An art initiative 
took the form of a collaborative mural with village school 
children.
Junior business administration major Grace Han, who 
traveled with the group in 
May, re?ected on the groups 
success in gearing its workshops toward the needs of 
the Nicaraguans, rather than 
imposing its own agenda. The 
locals appreciated this attitude, Juntos members said.
Helping others isnt always going to be glamorous 
and big, Han said. Sometimes its going to be small but 
really signi?cant.
Juntos co-leader Juan 
Acosta, a junior professional 
writing and Hispanic studies 
double major, stressed the 
group members desire not 
just to complete projects but 
also to re?ect on the meaning 
of their service.

Advances in neuroscience 
and computational learning 
developed in the basement of 
Wean Hall will be featured in 
the second episode of the PBS 
series Brains on Trial with 
Alan Alda, which airs this 
Wednesday.
The episode, narrated by 
actor and science advocate

of the Center for Cognitive 
Brain Imaging, chair of the 
machine learning department 
Tom Mitchell, and assistant 
professor of social and decision sciences Karim Kassam. 
Just, Mitchell, and Kassams 
research revealed unexpected 
similarities among peoples 
neural representations of 
concrete objects and speci?c 
emotions. Just and his colleagues had method actors 
from Carnegie Mellon Universitys School of Drama internalize speci?c emotions under 
an fMRI scanner. From these 
scans, researchers developed 
a computer-generated algorithm to identify emotions 
that actors were portraying.
It turns out there is 
an enormous commonality 
across people. This was never 
known before  that our neural representations of objects, 
of emotions  of other things, 
are common. Our brains all 
use the same code, Just said.
One of the most amazing 
facets of this research is that

There was a motion to 
allocate $800 to Sigma Phi 
Epsilon for its Labor Day Barbecue. Since there was no 
non-Senate representative 
from Sigma Phi Epsilon to 
speak for the fraternity, Senate Finance Chair Andrew

He made the point that 
the Labor Day Barbecue bene?ted the entire campus, and 
at one point was run by Senate. Schwartz noted, too, that 
similar allocations for Sigma 
Phi Epsilons Labor Day Barbecue have been approved in 
previous years. 
The allocation was funded 
without change, after a hand

Points of Discussion
A senator asked the Senate Chair Lukas Ronner how 
Senate Week planning is coming along. Ronner responded 
that Senate Week has been 
budgeted for and the promotional handouts have been 
approved. Speakers and the 
schedule have been set, but 
the public relations still need 
planning. Senate Week will be 
the week of Oct. 21.
Senators also discussed a

behind what were doing, asking questions like, What does 
service mean? and What 
does it mean to you?  Acosta 
said. Were looking at the 
larger context of how this act 
of going to this country and 
interacting with these people 
re?ects on us and this larger 
institution and the fact that 
theyre funding us.
But the service does not 
end after the trip, Acosta emphasized. 
Engaging with people at 
home and offering fresh perspectives is just as important 
to Juntos members efforts to 
better their communities.
You can have an impact, 
and you can be an agent of 
social change just through dialogue, Acosta said.
Audience members watching the presentation were generally receptive of the groups 
message about the richness 
of local and international 
service.
Sometimes people get 
critical about helping others 
abroad instead of at home, 
but I think this is really a worthy cause that I can hopefully 
join, sophomore psychology 
and modern languages double 
major Sammie Walker said.
In order to apply for a 
Tartans Abroad scholarship, 
which funds groups like Juntos as well as individuals, students must ?ll out a formal 
application. 
These scholarships apply 
only to academic breaks; the 
application for the upcoming 
winter session is due Oct. 31. 
Students interested in other study abroad opportunities 
can call the Of?ce of International Education and make 
an appointment with a study 
abroad adviser.
Studying abroad is a great 
way for students to intellectually expand their horizons, 
Coordinator for Study Abroad 
and Exchange Programs Chris 
Menand said. It creates new 
independence and creativity 
to work with people who think 
differently from you.
Were helping to address some of the theater 
needs of organizations like 
ScotchnSoda, she added. 
The studio theater would 
have dance-quality ?ooring 
along with lighting systems 
and a sound system that 
Vaughan hopes will be easy 
for people to understand and 
use.
The second level of the 
University Center addition 
will have another ?tness area 
on top of the ?tness space to 
be built on the ?rst ?oor, this 
one with cardio equipment. 
The ?tness center will be an 
upgrade over the current 
space for such equipment.
Along with being a cardio 
workout area, the ?oor will 
have largeand mediumsized exercise studios and a 
cycling studio. 
With interest in physical 
education classes also at a 
high, Centor claimed, a new 
?tness center with such space 
would be bene?cial.
Now well have three 
spaces every day where we 
teach these classes. The ?rst 
and second ?oors of the ?tness center will be connected, with individuals being 
comfortable working out on 
both ?oors, Centor said.
Horgan hopes there will 
be a sizable amount of space 
in this building with more 
windows that let sunlight into 
the building. He also mentioned possible ideas to make 
the new University Center 
more aesthetically pleasing, 
such as a garden, rock walls 
covered in plants, and maybe 
even a small fountain.
The meeting revealed that 
a schematic design is currently being developed. The hope 
is for a complete design to be 
?nalized at the beginning of 
2014, with construction starting in spring 2014 and ?nishing at the beginning of the 
201516 academic year. Presenters encouraged guests to 
view a current model they 
have of the building.
Various individuals asked 
questions at the town hall 
about the future building, 
with an emphasis on the new 
studio theater.
Andrew Schwartz, a junior information systems major, asked if there would be a 
stage in the rehearsal space; 
he was told that while there 
would not be a stage built 
into the space, there was also 
a fairly minimal need for such 
a stage.
Students and faculty 
raised other feedback, including the recommendation 
of including a visible sign 
that would welcome people 
to campus, and the potential 
problem of having too much 
sunshine from the buildings 
many windows.
While many students are 
excited about the addition, 
some wonder if a new ?tness center facility is needed. 
When asked if he felt the 
Skibo Gym or University Center facilities need an upgrade, 
Aditya Dargan, a sophomore 
business administration major, replied, No, they dont.

the plans for expanding the 
University Center can be

Caribou Coffee.
Caribou Coffee stores are 
closing in Ohio; Michigan; 
Washington, D.C.; Maryland;

eastern Wisconsin; and other 
parts of Pennsylvania. 
The Caribou Coffee on 
Brownsville Road in Brentwood had closed even earlier 
than the locations in Oakland, 
the Waterworks, and South 
Side. 
The closings come after 
Caribou Coffee was acquired 
last April by Joh. A. Benckiser, 
a German investment ?rm. 
The same ?rm also recently bought Peets, according to 
the Pittsburgh Business Times. 
The four Pittsburgh locations are only a few of the 88 
stores being replaced by Peets 
Coffee and Tea,  a coffee chain 
based in Berkeley, California.
Alice Borie, a sophomore 
information systems major 
and Northern California native, is eager for the arrival of 
the traditionally West Coast 
chain. 
Im excited for Peets because it means that the West 
Coast is coming to the East 
Coast. They have really good 
pastries, their coffee is really 
good, and they have really 
cool coffee mugs, Borie said. 
Peets was founded by Alfred 
Peet in 1966 in Berkeley. 
According to the companys website, Peet was 
shocked by what the U.S. 
called coffee when he came 
to America from Holland after 
World War II.
Peets promises on its 
website small batches, fresh 
beans, superior quality, and 
a dark roast produc[ing] a 
coffee that [is] rich and complex.
Peets, according to the 
Post-Gazette, started its expansion into the Midwest in 
August.
 Peets plans to open 10 
stores in the Cleveland area; 
six stores in the Columbus, 
Ohio area; and two stores in 
Dayton, Ohio.
Were excited to bring 
Peets to more neighborhoods 
across the U.S. and will share 
more details on further store 
openings in the Midwest and 
East Coast at a later time, 
said Peets spokeswoman Amy 
Lester in an email to the PostGazette.

abstract emotions like anger. 
The identi?cation of these 
common neural patterns has 
profound implications for the 
criminal justice system, where 
the technology may help identify the presence of remorse or 
other motivation.
Its nice to have video 
tape, its nice to have eye witnesses, but we also have to 
take into account what the accused perpetrator was thinking, Just said. Were they really planning to stab someone 
for weeks and weeks, or did 
they trip while carrying the 
knife?
Just acknowledged that 
several hurdles remain before 
this technology is ready for 
use in the courtroom.
With this technique, you 
still cant tell whether this person is sincere or not. But one 
of the experiments that Karim 
and I have on the drawing 
boards is having sincere versus fake remorse, sincere versus fake anger, he said.
This research provides evidence for the theory of a biological basis of emotion and 
the foundations for reading 
others thoughts and can have

Europeans seek further proof for Martian life
The European Space Agency, in conjunction with Russian space agency Roscosmos, 
plans to launch a mission to 
Mars within the next decade. 
The ExoMars rover is planned 
to land on the surface in 2018 
with the primary objective 
of detecting the presence of 
biological life that exists currently or may have in the past. 
The main tool being used is a 
model bacteria created to predict what microbial life could 
survive under the conditions 
of extreme radiation on Mars.
Evidence from previous 
rovers shows the presence of 
argon isotopes, a prevalent element in Earths atmosphere, 
in the atmosphere of Mars. 
This indicates that radiation 
once had much less of an effect on Mars. This atmosphere, 
however, is likely to have been 
ejected by the heavy solar 
wind which existed billions of 
years ago.

Researchers ?gure out how to implant memories in mice
Scientists at the University 
of California, Irvines neurological department believe 
they have found a method to 
create memories within the 
brains of mice. Norman Weinberger and his team played 
a speci?c tone while stimulating the release of a main 
neurotransmitter involved in 
memory formation. This increased the number of brain 
cells which responded to the 
tone. The next day, many 
sounds were played to the test 
mice, including the tone from 
the day before. When this tone 
played, the scientists noted an 
increase in the rate of breathing of the mice, suggesting 
that a memory had been created by direct manipulation of 
the brain.
Disorders of learning and 
memory are a major issue facing many people ... our hope is 
that our research will pave the 
way to prevent or resolve this 
global issue, Weinberger said

Gold may provide a new way to garner solar energy
Research at the University 
of Pennsylvania has led to a 
more ef?cient solar energy 
collector, using a cost effective 
form of gold. Dawn Bonnell, 
vice provost of research, leads 
the project that uses a layer of 
gold nanoparticles  along 
with a light sensitive molecule 
called porphyrin  to create 
plasmonic nanostructures. 
These plasmons absorb radiation and release a current of 
electrons through the gold 
particles, which enhances the 
scattering of light.
The technology is based 
on the structure and spacing 
of the nanoparticles of gold.   
These can determine the appropriate wavelengths with 
which the plasmons react. 
You could imagine having a 
paint on your laptop that acted like a solar cell to power it 
using only sunlight, Bonnell 
said. This process is three to 
10 times more effective than 
normal photoelectric methods

Testing determines  dinosaur DNA too old to sequence
In the 90s, studies suggested that insects frozen in 
fossils contained their ancient 
DNA, similar to the scienti?c 
premise for director Steven 
Spielbergs 1993 ?lm Jurassic Park. However, studies at 
the University of Manchester 
conclude that this is not the 
case. Using a technique which 
should prevent any contaminant DNA from entering the 
test material, organisms found 
in amber were tested for the 
presence of DNA. The test organisms showed no potential 
for DNA to reside within the 
amber.
The technique used in previous experiments was unreliable for testing such ancient 
DNA. Undamaged DNA molecules that contaminate an 
extract of partially degraded 
ancient ones give false positive 
results that might be mistaken 
for genuine ancient DNA, 
Terry Brown of the University 
of Manchester said.

Voyager spacecraft may have ?nally left solar system
Data from probes on the 
Voyager 1 spacecraft potentially shows proof that the 
spacecraft has left the solar 
system. The data from Aug. 
25, 2012 show that the density of particles has increased 
from 0.002 to 0.1 cubic centimeters, indicating that it 
is now in interstellar space. 
The spacecraft has traveled at 
about 60,000 kilometers per 
hour since 1977, and is now 
18.2 billion kilometers from 
the Sun.
Some, however, believe 
that this change in density is 
not yet enough proof, since the 
Voyager 1 lacks a functional 
plasma detecting instrument. 
George Gloeckler from University of Michigan believes 
we should wait another two 
or three years for Voyager 2 to 
reach this distance. Voyager 
2 will experimentally answer 
this question. Why rush to 
conclusions now? Gloeckler 
said.

Geneticists look for genes that impact handedness
Researchers have learned 
more information about the 
genes of hand preference. William Brandler and colleagues 
at the University of Oxford 
examined 3,300 test subjects, 
to determine the strength of 
their right or left handedness. 
Among these subjects, there 
was one gene out of 100,000 
which they had in common, 
called PCSK6. Brandler says 
When we looked up what the 
gene actually does, it was a 
real eureka moment.
The PCSK6 gene is related 
to the asymmetrical development of an organism. When 
this gene was altered in mice, 
their organs were ?ipped 
across their body, leaving their 
hearts on the right side. Although this gene plays a clear 
role in handedness, it is also 
known that environment is a 
factor in human development.

Apple made things simple 
by giving people a smartphone 
with one button. But imagine 
ditching the button and commanding a computer without 
any tactile controls. Imagine 
controlling a computer by 
moving your hands in front 
of a screen, and youll get the 
Leap Motion Controller by 
Leap Motion. Like a miniature 
version of the Microsofts Kinect, the controller allows users to twist, turn, pinch, and 
manipulate all sorts of visualizations with two hands and 
10 ?ngers with no direct contact required.
The controller contains 
two cameras and three infrared LED sensors. With all of 
these working together, the 
controller can detect a users 
hands and ?ngers on three 
axes. It recognizes location, 
speed, and speci?c gestures 
like quickly drawing a circle in 
the air with your ?nger.
The device itself is incredibly small  about the size of 
a few sticks of gum  and is 
conveniently USB powered. 
Adding it to your workspace 
will only be an issue if you are 
already strapped for USB ports 
or have your desk space meticulously laid out. Otherwise, 
it is a completely unobtrusive 
device.
Installing the software is 
fairly straightforward and 
quick, and starts out with an 
orientation to the device. The 
orientation is the ?rst interaction users have with the controller, and serves as a good 
way to introduce the device to 
friends.
Its ?ashy and entertaining to see that hand motions 
above your computer affect 
particles onscreen, and to see 
wireframes of your ?ngers, 
hands, and wrist appear before you like something out of 
Tron or Iron Man. The precision is remarkable, and there 
is such a low latency (the time 
delay between performing an 
action and seeing its result onscreen) that it appears there 
is no delay between what you 
do and what you see on your 
computer.
Beyond the orientation experience, whats available on 
Airspace  Leap Motions app 
store for software designed 
speci?cally for the motion 
controller  is currently lacking. This is to be expected for a 
relatively new device, as most 
of the apps are focused on the 
whimsy of motion control, not 
exploring the devices full potential.
However, among the 
bounty of gimmicky apps are 
a few that demonstrate Leap 
Motions long-term potential. 
Molecules, a pre-installed app, 
allows users to view 3-D models of various molecules and 
chemicals. Users can rotate, 
scale, zoom, and pan around 
the various molecules with 
very intuitive and natural gestures. The accessibility is the 
selling point of this free app, 
which explores the capabilities the Leap Motion Controller has as an educational tool. 
There is a lot of potential for 
this technology to be used in 
classrooms across the world.
This potential can be skewered by poor control design, 
though. Another app, the already popular Google Earth, 
is pre-installed and given motion controls through the device. However, using the app 
is nearly impossible. As soon 
as it loads, poor hand placement can jettison Earth into 
a crazy spin that is dif?cult 
to stop. Additionally, actually 
navigating this 3-D globe is 
hard; every twist and turn the 
planet makes seems to be accidental, and never what the 
user intended to do with his or 
her hand placement. Luckily, 
most of the software available 
isnt this dif?cult to control, 
but a poor control interface 
like this can ruin a users experience with an app, and with 
the Leap Motion.
The technology is impressive, but the current software 
available leaves something to 
be desired. However, this is 
a much better situation than 
having broken technology; 
better apps can and most likely will be made soon, utilizing 
the full potential of the Leap 
Motion Controller.

Chemistry determines the taste of your favorite brew
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
As evidenced by the outcry 
over the potential closing of 
the local bar Panther Hollow 
Inn last spring, Carnegie Mellon students love their beer. 
However, students here may 
not know how this refreshing 
drink is made and what gives 
it that smooth taste.
Beer is composed of four 
main ingredients: water, malt, 
hops, and yeast. The simplest explanation of the beermaking process is that the 
malt releases sugars into hot 
water, the yeast turns these 
sugars into alcohol, and the 
hops provide the bitter kick. 
But lets go into more detail. 
What are the steps of brewing 
beer? In the book Beer Craft: A 
Simple Guide to Making Great 
Beer, William Bostwick and 
Jessi Rymill describe the process in six easy steps.
The ?rst step is called 
mashing. This step is done the 
same way one might make a 
cup of tea, except instead of 
a small bag of tea leaves in a 
mug of hot water, a large mesh 
bag of grain (malt) is steeped 
in a stockpot of hot water. On 
John Palmers website How 
To Brew, he describes the 
malting process: The debranching, beta-glucanase, and 
proteolytic enzymes do their 
work, preparing the starches 
for easy access and conversion to sugars. Depending 
on the type of grain being 
used and what type of beer is 
being made, different grainto-water ratios and different 
temperatures for the hot water 
are used. For example, Beer 
Advocate says that specialty 
dark malts are used in small 
quantities and produce stouts 
or bocks; roasted malts are 
used in mild and brown ales; 
and wheat malt, obviously, is 
a main component of wheat 
beers. The temperature of the 
water is dependent upon what 
temperature the enzymes in 
the particular malt being used 
perform the best at.
The second step is to sparge 
the wort  this is the sweet 
mixture left in the stockpot 
after the grains have been 
steeped for about an hour. In 
this step, the mesh bag of grain 
is removed, and the last of the 
wort drains into the stockpot. 
After the mesh bag has been 
drained, the grains must be 
rinsed in a fresh pot of hot 
water, then allowed to steep, 
and sparged again. This is to 
ensure the maximum wort is 
made from the grain. 
The third step is boiling the 
wort. This is where the hops 
or other spices are added to 
the mixture. Some examples 
of hops that are listed on the 
website freshops.com include 
Amarillo, Cascade, and Centennial, which are citrus-like 
spices used in India pale ales 
(IPAs), and the aromatic Hallertau and Liberty that are 
used in lagers and bocks. 
About.com discusses the importance of timing during this 
step. Hops break down as they 
are boiled, causing their ?avor 
to evaporate and disappear. 
Consequently, the more hops 
that are added early on during 
the boil, the more bitter the 
beer will be.
The fourth phase is chilling. This step is crucial because yeast cannot operate at 
the temperature of the boiled 
wort. During the chilling process, chunks of protein settle 
out of the mixture, leaving the 
beer nice and smooth. 
When the wort is suf?-
ciently chilled, the ?fth step is 
funneling the wort into a fermenter, which is when brewers add the yeast to the brew 
and convert the sugars into 
alcohol and of?cially turn the 
mixture into beer. This occurs 
because the glucose enters in 
the yeast through diffusion 
and is broken down through 
glycolysis. This process results 
in pyruvates and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), according 
to howstuffworks.com
While the ATP is used to 
supply energy to the yeast, the 
pyruvates are converted by the 
yeast into carbon dioxide and 
ethanol  the alcohol. For the 
?rst day or two of fermentation, a blow-off tube should be 
attached to the opening of the 
fermenter to collect proteins, 
hop resins, and dead yeast 
cells. This tube is then replaced by an airtight cap, and 
the beer is left to ferment. This 
process takes approximately 
one week, although stronger 
beers require longer fermentation periods.
The sixth and ?nal step 
is bottling. As in the case of 
transferring the wort from the 
pot to the fermenter, the transfer of beer from the fermenter 
to bottles must be done carefully with a tracking cane and 
tube to make sure no sediment 
gets into the bottles. After the 
bottles are ?lled and capped, 
they should be allowed to carbonate in a dark, cool spot for 
a week or two. The last test 
of patience comes after this, 
when the carbonated bottles 
must sit in the fridge for another week.
And with that, any student 
can ponder over the process 
and the science of brewing 
while enjoying a cold beer.
Malt releases 
sugars into hot 
water, the yeast 
turns these 
sugars into 
alcohol, and the 
hops provide 
a bitter kick. 
But lets go into 
more detail.

students may be left with unmet expectations. Whether 
looking for an internship or 
a full-time job, students still 
have a wide variety of options 
available to them.
Explore TartanTrak
While the conferences offer an excellent opportunity to 
meet with potential employers in person, students have a 
much larger pool of employers 
available to them year-round 
through TartanTrak, which offers over 11,000 company pro?les. These 11,000 businesses 
currently offer around 2,200 
positions for which Carnegie 
Mellon students can apply via 
the universitys online service.
The fairs are wonderful 
opportunities for students to 
network with employers and 
to secure that ?rst interview. 
But it is not the only way, 
said Farouk Dey, the director 
of Carnegie Mellons Career 
and Professional Development 
Center (CPDC) in an interview 
two years ago.
There are many employers 
who are out there who choose 
not to come to the conference 
for one reason or another but 
are still very interested in 
Carnegie Mellon students. The 
?rst place I would always send 
students to is TartanTrak, Dey 
said. I want to encourage every student, whether they get 
an interview or not, to go on 
TartanTrak and look up these 
employers.
Students can visit 
TartanTrak to submit rsums, 
sign up for interviews, and 
explore job opportunities. 
Students can register for their 
TartanTrak login information 
at http://www.cmu.edu/
career/tartantrak/index.html.
Expand professional 
networks
According to Dey, the majority of university students 
across the country ?nd their 
jobs through previously established connections.
Networking is really the 
No. 1 way people get jobs, 
Dey said. Occasionally these 
connections can be neighbors 
or family friends, but most of 
the time these are professional connections that students 
have developed through joining clubs, organizations, or 
committees.
Dey said that students must 
?rst be aware of the contacts 
they have available to them 
and then leverage these connections. Many, however, 
wonder how exactly to begin 
taking advantage of their networks. According to Dey, it is 
often just a matter of getting 
the word out.
The ?rst place to start is 
to let people know that youre 
looking  let your parents 
know, let your friends know, 
let your roommate know. Inform people that you are approaching graduation and are 
beginning to look for a fulltime position, Dey said. Just 
the fact that youre letting 
them know and asking them 
to keep you in mind if they 
hear about an opportunity increases your chances of being 
in the right place at the right 
time.
Take advantage of online 
networking
The advantages of online 
networking are often not 
succesfully leveraged by 
students. The internet, along 
with tools such as Facebook 
and LinkedIn, give students the 
option of reaching hundreds, if 
not thousands, of their friends 
and acquaintances with one 
click of a mouse.
One of the tools I often 
recommend is LinkedIn. It is 
fantastic because it not only 
allows you to document all the 
people in your professional 
network who you know, but 
it also allows you to tap into a 
larger network through those 
people, Dey said.
As an example, Dey opened 
his own LinkedIn pro?le to 
show the power of the site. 
This is my LinkedIn page and 
I use it very much. You can 
see I have 331 connections  
these are people that I know 
personally through my career 
or some are also friends or acquaintances. Through these 
331 connections I am then 
connected to 3,316,810 people, Dey said.
Dey explained the power 
of such online networking services by giving a hypothetical 
example. If I am interested in 
working for Intel, I can type 
Intel into the LinkedIn search. 
The ?rst people that show up 
in my list are the people who 
are connected to me but also 
have a strong connection to Intel. They may know someone 
else who works there, or have 
worked there themselves. The 
great part about this is I now 
know who to contact to begin 
my search. It is a powerful way 
to look for connections.
Be persistent
For those students who 
may leave the conferences 
feeling let down, persistence 
will pay off, according to Dey. 
He believes that it is important 
to not give up when hunting 
for a job.
Even the employers who 
you may have met at the 
[BOC/TOC/EOC] who maybe 
did not offer you an interview 
at the conference  it is okay 
to return to them and ask 
them to reconsider or if they 
have any other opportunities, 
Dey said. 
It really is a matter of engaging your professional associations, networking both 
online and in person, getting 
involved, and I would ?nish 
by telling students to not lose 
hope. Be persistent.

Changing university culture not impossible
 The New York Times published 
an article last week about Harvard 
Business Schools (HBSs) recent attempts to change its campus culture 
 speci?cally pertaining to sexism 
 for both students and members 
of the faculty. Female students were 
falling behind their male counterparts in both grades and class participation, and the male faculty far 
outnumbered the female faculty. 
Over one-third of HBS students were 
women in 2008, yet less than 20 percent were Baker scholars, or in the 
top 5 percent of the class, according 
to The New York Times. 
Students and faculty alike reported a culture that was hostile to 
women, including hazing of female 
students and professors, and a lack 
of respect for female faculty. The New 
York Times reports that from 2006 
to 2007, a third of the female junior faculty left. In 2010, the dean 
of HBS instituted a new program to 
increase awareness of gender issues. 
Students were required to attend 
discussions on gender relations at 
the school, and female faculty members received more extensive and 
comprehensive support from the 
administration.
Carnegie Mellon University has 
also had a history of being a maledominated institution  and some 
would argue that it still is. This trend 
stemmed from a historically higher 
male enrollment, but manifested 
itself particularly in the sciences. 
However, the universitys female-tomale ratio has improved noticeably 
in recent years, and is now 2:3, according to Carnegie Mellons enrollment data. While this division is not 
perfect, it is de?nitely a step in the 
right direction.
Changing a campuss culture can 
seem like an impossible task. Seminars can prove ineffective in the face 
of inequality, because a culture of inequality is engendered by deeply ingrained behaviors  one that people 
learn long before they ever get to the 
university setting. 
But Harvards initiative in this 
matter paid off. 
Although some of the students 
expressed dissatisfaction with the 
program  particularly with the 
campus-wide gender discussions  
grades of female students shot up as 
they were encouraged more to participate in the classroom, and performance reviews of female faculty 
members increased rapidly as the 
teachers received more support from 
the administration, according to The 
New York Times.
HBS observed something in their 
culture that they disagreed with, and 
took steps to remedy that issue. Carnegie Mellons new female-to-male ratio shows that the university is also 
able to overcome habits and cultural 
stereotypes. With HBSs initiative to 
?ght gender issues as an example, 
Carnegie Mellon can also make progress on ingrained issues.
Although Carnegie Mellon has 
tried something similar with its ingrained stress culture, there has 
been limited success. Part of the difference between HBSs and Carnegie 
Mellons situations lies in the way 
that those cultures manifested; at 
HBS, sexism was so pervasive that 
male students would harass even female faculty members, and female 
performance across the board was 
lower than that of males, because female students were not receiving the 
same support, according to The New 
York Times. 
Explaining to students that sexism is wrong and should be avoided 
is a more concrete concept to make 
apparent to students than explaining to students that they dont need 
to push themselves past the limits 
of their own endurance to get the 
best grades, because stress culture 
is fundamentally tied to the natural 
desire to succeed in life. However, 
HBSs recent successes with a deeply 
entrenched culture could lead Carnegie Mellon in a more positive direction with its own attempts to change 
from within.
University must update campus about Beta
Beta Theta Pi was suspended 
from campus last semester after allegations regarding the ?lming and 
circulation of sexually explicit photos 
and video, which led to a subsequent 
investigation into severe hazing. 
The suspension was announced in 
an email by Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno. During the summer, 
Betas national chapter announced 
that their Carnegie Mellon chapter 
would permanently close.
Carnegie Mellon refused to comment on the incident at the time because the University Polices investigation was still ongoing. However, 
since that message in the spring, 
there has been no update from 
university administration about 
the investigations progress or its 
conclusion.
Carnegie Mellon needs to inform 
the university community of the current status of the Beta investigation.
Beta has come into the spotlight 
again, as Rolling Stone magazine recently published its list of The Most 
Out-Of-Control Fraternities in America last month and ranked Carnegie 
Mellons Beta chapter fourth in the 
nation.
Though the scandal surrounding 
individuals in Beta may have faded, 
the incident itself has clearly not disappeared, and neither has its impact 
on the Carnegie Mellon community. 
Any violation of students rights to 
safety and privacy is a black mark 
against the university. Carnegie 
Mellon should avoid an unsavory 
reputation for Greek life, especially 
because Greek life is an important 
and vibrant part of the campus community. Carnegie Mellon should be 
as open and transparent as possible 
regarding the scandals aftermath to 
protect its reputation.
The university should be more 
responsible to its student body by 
informing the campus community 
if the investigation is still ongoing, 
and if it is not, what conclusions 
the University Police have reached 
so far. The university should also 
specify what legal repercussions the 
investigation will yield. While the 
university cannot release the names 
of individuals accused of crimes in 
connection with the scandal, the 
campus community should know if 
charges have been ?led, and what 
those charges were.
The university should also open a 
dialogue about what steps are being 
taken to ensure that an incident like 
this does not occur again. 
No matter how many individuals 
were involved in the incident, the 
university has an obligation to ensure that individuals do not commit 
acts of questionable nature within a 
student organization again. In creating a dialogue, the university should 
also inform the campus community 
of what steps they have already taken to minimize the possibility of future incidents.
The Beta scandal is a delicate issue, and must be treated with the utmost care. However, handling a situation with the care it deserves and 
failing to keep the campus community informed about such a monumentally important issue are not the 
same thing. The university should 
release an update on the Beta investigation as soon as possible.

Sepp Blatter, president of the 
worlds soccer governing body, gave 
a speech in 2010 at the Fdration 
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) headquarters in Zurich, 
on both the physical and cultural 
space that soccer had traversed, according to FIFAs of?cial website. He 
evoked the fundamental ideals that 
the World Cup and the Olympics are 
based on  world peace and acceptance of diversity. 
Blatters speech also preceded 
the announcement of the host nations of the 2018 and 2022 World 
Cups. The two winning nations 
could possibly be two of the worst 
locales for hosting soccers premier 
event.
Russia, which recently came under ?re for its policies against homosexuality, will host the World Cup 
in 2018, while Qatar will host the 
World Cup in 2022. To a discerning soccer fan, Russia barely makes 
more sense than Qatar. Russia has 
a promising young crop of players, 
along with some competitive European club teams like Zenit St. Petersburg, CSKA Moscow, and Anzhi 
Makhachkala.
What does Qatar have? Blatter 
says that FIFA chose Qatar because 
of plans to extend soccer culture 
into the region. Although an admirable goal, there were three key 
questions asked when Qatar was announced, and all of them are still hot 
topics for debate. These three topics 
point to FIFAs puzzling behavior 
and question FIFAs goal of soccer 
development.
The ?rst topic is climate. Simply 
put, its pretty hard to run around 
for 90 minutes in 122F weather.
So why did FIFA pick such a harsh 
climate, other than to encourage 
FIFA spirit in the region? Many critics, such as U.S. national team star 
Eric Wynalda, immediately pointed 
to Qatars oil reserves and the capital that comes along with them, and 
of course, the bulging pockets of 
FIFA voters, reported ESPN. 
Oil money, however, is a common 
factor in European soccer. The Telegraph says that Sheikh Mansour bin 
Zayed Al Nahyan, the half-brother 
of the United Arab Emirates president, has spent nearly $1.5 billion 
on Manchester City  an English 
team  in player transfers, wages, 
and stadium expansions.
Furthermore, whistleblower Phaedra Al Majid came forward and 
accused FIFA voting members of 
corruption and bribery, according 
to The Guardian. Her case was soon 
denied and knocked aside, with Al 
Majid herself making a U-turn and 
denying any wrongdoings by Qatar 
agents. Considering Qatars surprising bidding victory and mountains 
of money, as well as FIFAs general 
operational and ?nancial opaqueness, it does not take much imagination to speculate about a large-scale 
corruption scandal.
The last issue is one that Russia 
shares, as host of the 2018 World 
Cup and the 2014 Winter Olympics. 
Qatar and Russia do not provide 
suitable political, social, and religious environments.
The 40,000-plus seating stadiums all look amazing, but Qatar is a 
tiny nation-state. In fact, Qatar is so 
small that in 2010 it would not have 
been able to handle the massive in?ux of fans and tourists just because 
it did not have suf?cient hotel space, 
said FIFA in its 2022 FIFA World 
Cup Bid Evaluation Report: Qatar. 
FIFA said in the bid book that with 
the stadiums, labor costs would be 
astronomical   amounting to approximately $3 billion  even when 
considering Qatars mountains of 
money. A large majority of the workers will come from Asia and will endure harsh working and living conditions, possibly triggering human 
rights violations, says the Human 
Rights Watch. Imagine the 122-degree weather  and then picture the 
overcrowded migrant-worker labor 
camps  as Human Rights Watch 
labeled them  which have no air 
conditioning or ventilation.
Qatar also outright bans any homosexual activity. Blatter said that 
gay fans should refrain from any 
sexual activities during their stay, 
reported BBC. BBC said that Qatar was one of 79 member nations 
that sanctioned extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions on the 
grounds of sexual orientation during a United Nations vote. Bear in 
mind that the Olympics, and by extension, the World Cup, only started 
to encourage sportsmanship, international cooperation and equality 
for all. 
All of this behavior  including 
Qatar, Blatter, and FIFAs behavior 
 points to the worrying fact that 
the nature of FIFA, the International 
Olympic Committee, and the internationalist spirit in the world of 
sports is changing. 
The beauty of soccer is its simplicity and wide appeal. A ball is all 
that is needed to start playing. Soccer has come such a long way and 
has broken many barriers, but now 
it is time to break new ones. Soccer 
is supposed to be a source of hope to 
humanity, discipline, and respect, as 
Blatter says in the welcome text of 
the Sepp Blatter Foundation website. International sporting events 
highlight diversity and the acceptance of different races, religions, 
and political alignments. But looking ahead in 2022, FIFA seems to 
be centering itself around wealth, 
?air, and a complete disregard for 
its fundamental purpose of bringing 
different people together under the 
banner of soccer and its spirit.
FIFA hosts not worthy

Following talks in London on 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assads 
alleged use of deadly toxins on 
civilians, Secretary of State John 
Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have agreed 
to destroy Syrias chemical weapons by by mid-2014, according to 
The Daily Mail. The Assad regime 
agreed to sign the United Nations 
chemical weapons ban treaty and 
became a legitimate member of 
the Chemical Weapons Convention this past week.
However, tensions persist as 
world leaders attempt to bring an 
end to Syrias civil war without 
destabilizing the region, according to The New York Times. By 
agreeing to the solution that Kerry 
made as an off-handed comment 
during the London talks, Russia 
has been forced into a position 
of responsibility by international 
pressures in a high-stakes bid to 
prevent U.S. military intervention 
on the continent. 
If unsuccessful, Moscows legitimacy and soft power hegemony in 
international politics could be substantially weakened, reports The 
Guardian.
If successful, however, the 
agreement could result in stronger 
ties between Washington and Moscow and may usher Syria into an 
era of stability. While uncertainty 
still lingers, Syrias legal membership in the International Convention on Chemical Weapons means 
that regardless of the plans outcome, Kerrys accidental diplomacy has brought the Assad regime a 
step closer to political legitimacy 
and stability.
Looking into the future, placing 
Syria under the United Nationss 
control and transitioning the government away from Assad should 
be the primary goal of American 
foreign policy. While an arms 
deal may stem the tide of civilian 
suppression and weaken Syrias 
resolve, casualties will continue 
under the regime as long as Assad 
?ghts to maintain power.
Kerry and Obama have discussed the notion that a military 
strike may occur regardless of 
deals on chemical arms in order 
to ensure that Syria does not have 
the resources required to sti?e 
resistance movements and kill 
innocent civilians, according to 
The Guardian. International actors 
should be wary of Syrias internal 
con?icts and move forward with 
a plan that will stunt the Assad 
regime, reduce civilian casualties, 
and allow rebel forces to gain the 
upper hand.
Both Kerry and Obama should 
consider moving forward with 
military intervention and rebel aid 
even after Assad forfeits his chemical weapons. By stunting the dictatorships ability to use weapons 
of mass destruction and providing 
guidance to opposing forces, the 
U.S. would be able to help Syria 
transition into a democracy while 
minimizing backlash and regional 
destabilization.

Late last year, a young physiotherapy intern in New Delhi was brutally 
gang-raped after boarding a bus by 
six men, according to The Washington Post. The attackers included the 
driver and one minor. The woman 
died soon after due to her injuries. 
Recently, a 22-year-old photojournalist from Mumbai was gang-raped 
in an abandoned textile factory, reports The Guardian. Additionally, 
Michaela Cross (otherwise known 
as Rose Chasm), published a now famous CNN iReport, in which she describes in horri?c detail the way she 
was stared at, groped and harassed 
daily by Indian men during a study 
abroad trip to India in 2012.
As a young Indian man, I feel an 
uneasy mix of shame and indignation when I think about these incidents. The fact that Indian men can 
perform such acts is shameful, but 
at the same time, these isolated incidents result in the creation of broad 
stereotypes and incorrect generalizations. The really heart-breaking part 
about Michaela Crosss CNN piece is 
the thousands of comments that accompany it. Some implore people, 
especially women, to stay away from 
India. Some apologize to Michaela 
on the behalf of Indians everywhere. 
There is ignorance, but also fear 
in what people wrote. As I read the 
comments, I found myself getting defensive and thinking, Were not all 
like that.
India gives a whole new meaning 
to the word diversity. With 1.2 billion 
people, over 500 languages and dialects, and more than ten widely practiced religions, one simply cannot 
speak about every Indian citizen in 
one breath. Im convinced that most 
Indian men are actually very helpful 
and warm people. 
There were 75,744 reported 
cases of sexual violence (including rape, molestation and harassment) in India in 2011, according to 
crowdvoice.org. The equivalent ?gure for the United States is 207,754 
cases, according to the Rape, Abuse 
& Incest National Network. Indias 
population is approximately four 
times that of Americas population, 
yet the United Statess rate of sexual 
violence is greater. Isnt it a little unfair to generalize the negative tendencies observed in 75,744 people 
onto the 655.8 million males in Indian society?
Admittedly, the entire issue is bigger than just the number of sexual 
violence cases. According to Delhibased psychologist Rajat Mitra in 
India Today, a substantial portion 
of sexual assault cases in India go 
unreported. It is even more depressing that a small minority of sexual 
offenders can poison Indias culture 
and create an atmosphere of fear. 
The average Indian woman longs for 
freedom from a society that has very 
strict expectations for her. 
Society may not hesitate to blame 
sexual assault on the victim, if it is 
believed that these expectations 
were disregarded. Especially in rural 
India, a girl must take certain necessary precautions, such as dressing 
conservatively, largely avoiding male 
company, and staying indoors after 
dark. Even in the urban and fairly 
liberalized setting of Mumbai, most 
of my female friends wouldnt wear 
shorts on the streets, or dare to step 
out alone after 10 p.m.
However, things are getting better. There is room for optimism. The 
New Delhi rape led to one of the largest demonstrations against sexual violence the world has ever seen. Massive protest rallies populated by both 
women and men engulfed the city for 
weeks. The Mumbai case led to similar, albeit comparatively smaller rallies. Michaela Crosss piece probably 
wouldnt have gotten the massive response it did if it came out a couple 
of years ago.
A critical mass of people are 
talking about change  the kind of 
change that rarely comes along  
in the privacy of their homes and in 
the public forum. People are tired of 
a small population of men distorting 
reality for the rest of us.

Over the last few decades, technology companies have fought to 
edge out competitors with more and 
more powerful devices. To display 
their power, they added more detail to their operating systems, with 
three-dimensional interfaces that 
bleakly mimicked real-world objects, 
in an attempt to ease the learning 
curve for new users.
Recently, Apple has been the 
largest offender of real-world object 
imitation, so much so that the word 
skeumorphism has become synonymous with its company name. 
Skeumorphism, or the imitation of 
real-life objects in software, favored 
greatly by the late Steve Jobs, found 
its way into nearly every aspect of 
iOS. 
Apple added everything from 
leather-textured siding in its Calendar application to spinning reels in 
its Voice Memos application. While 
this eye candy was initially appealing, it quickly became obtrusive to 
the experienced user and provided 
no functional bene?ts.
With iOS 7, Apple attempted to 
change its mobile operating systems 
design language, to one simpler and 
less obtrusive in nature. Jonathan 
Ive, senior vice president of design 
at Apple, immediately set forth to 
change the design of iOS after he 
was given responsibility to lead and 
direct Apples Human Interface division in October 2012, according to 
the companys press release.
Having used iOS 7 for the past 
few weeks, I can say that it is a joy to 
use. The icons that once over?owed 
with detail are now ?at and minimalistic. The lock screen is free from 
its once-restricting black bars, welcoming users to slide-to-unlock anywhere. Menus, navigation bars, and 
Apples ?rst party apps have adapted 
the same ?at interface that acts as a 
background to the users experience 
instead of trying to be the center of 
attention.
Ironically, the removal of skeumorphism has made the operating 
system feel more natural. Menu navigation is more ?uid, as one can swipe 
across the screen instead of relying 
on the previous back arrow icons.
Apples choice to remove skeumorphism has resulted in a more 
functional and powerful operating 
system, and has closed the difference 
between desktop and mobile computing. Simple graphs displaying sound 
wavelengths during recording have 
replaced unhelpful spinning reels in 
Voice Memos. In an ecosystem limited by screen size, the removal of 
functionless eye candy makes room 
for more powerful and functional applications.
The irony of this transformation 
in design is that its actually a step 
backward. Ever since Apple introduced the original Macintosh, the 
goal of software companies has been 
to emulate real-life objects in a way 
that relates to users. The idea for a 
desktop was essentially a copy of a 
real-life desk covered with items. 
Similarly, the idea of a folder system 
was simply a copy of a real-life organizer.
The interface was created on the 
idea of emulating real-life objects in 
a way that signi?cantly lowers the 
learning curve of operating systems. 
Apple and many other companies 
have learned, however, that a touchscreen is not a piece of lined paper, 
nor a physical tape recorder. In that 
sense, it is less capable than other 
real-life objects. 
However, in many ways, it can 
outperform them. Several companies, including Apple, are learning 
that when they attempt to make devices into something they are not, 
they are limiting their capabilities 
and functionalities. iOS 7 takes a 
step away from these interfaces into 
the right direction.
Flat is the new phat for Apples newest iOS 7
Assad should be displaced
The fact that 
Indian men can 
perform such acts 
is shameful, but 
at the same time, 
these isolated 
incidents result 
in the creation of 
broad stereotypes 
and incorrect 
generalizations.
In an ecosystem 
limited by screen 
size, the removal 
of functionless eye 
candy makes room 
for more powerful 
and functional 
applications.

Despite a sloppy beginning, 
the Carnegie Mellon football 
team was able to bounce back 
and defeat Allegheny College 
267 in its home opener.
After a sluggish ?rst quarter during which senior wide 
receiver Tim Swanson fumbled and senior quarterback 
Rob Kalkstein threw a redzone interception, the Tartans 
got on the scoreboard early in 
the second quarter.
The Tartans scoring drive 
started at their 49-yard line 
with 12:49 remaining in the 
second quarter. On the ?rst 
play, senior fullback Zachary 
Erra-Hernandez broke away 
for a fantastic 26-yard run. After a crucial 1-yard run by Rob 
Kalkstein on fourth-and-one, 
Erra-Hernandez capped the 
drive off with a 1-yard plunge, 
giving the Tartans a 70 lead.
The stout Tartan defense, 
led by seniors Jack Butler, 
Dallas Hartman, and Akwasi 
Brefo, kept the Gators off the 
scoreboard until a bizarre play 
at the end of the half.
The Gators started at their 
own 38-yard line with 37 seconds left in the half. After a 
20-yard pass from quarterback Jon Nigro to wide receiver Andrew Niklaus and a 
3-yard rush by Nick Diechler, 
the Gators had a chance for 
one ?nal play with four seconds remaining.
Even though he was nearly 
sacked, Nigro scrambled out 
of the pocket and threw a 
Hail Mary pass into the end 
zone, where it was caught by 
Niklaus to tie the game 77 at 
halftime.
The play had the potential 
to change the momentum of 
the game, but the Tartans never let that happen. 
In the second half, they 
exploded with 19 more points 
and shut down the Gator 
offense.
You just have to have a 
short memory in all sports, 
especially football. You never 
know, you can get a three-andout, and come right back and 
score, said Hartman. Our offense was really good last year 
and we knew that they would 
stop turning over the ball 
eventually.
The second half was led 
by Troy Witt. The sophomore 
running back rushed for two 
touchdowns, giving the Tartans a comfortable lead.
Witt made good use of the 
sidelines, most notably on a 
13-yard touchdown run that 
gave the Tartans a 137 lead 
with seven minutes remaining 
in the third quarter.
I got a few TDs, but that 
was all the linemen, Witt 
said. They open it for me and 
I am going to hit the holes and 
put it in the end zone.
Erra-Hernandez was excellent up the middle, gaining a 
well-earned 89 yards rushing 
on 19 carries to go along with 
his second-quarter touchdown. The one-two punch of 
Witt and Erra-Hernandez gave 
the Gator defense all sorts of 
?ts. Witt gained 103 yards 
rushing on 16 carries.
The Tartan football team 
next plays at Catholic College 
this Friday. Their next home 
game is homecoming on Sept. 
28 against Geneva College.
Witt, Erra-Hernandez spearhead ?rst victory for Tartans

Sophomore running back Troy Witt (10) heads for the end zone during the third quarter of Saturdays game. The 13-yard rush was Witts ?rst touchdown of the game; he scored another in 
the fourth quarter. The Tartans defeated Allegheny College 267, in the ?rst game of the year at Gesling Stadium.

After falling to Dickinson 
College in the ?nal seconds of 
the game on Sept. 7, the mens 
soccer team rallied back with 
a last-minute goal on Wednesday night against Geneva 
College.
In the 90th minute, senior 
Chris Wysocki headed a cross 
from ?rst-year mid?elder 
Tristan Lockwood into the side 
of the net for the only goal of 
the 10 game.
The play started when 
Lockwood sent a corner kick 
into a crowded Geneva penalty box. A Geneva defender 
headed it out to junior defender Mark Nicholas, who played 
the ball back to Lockwood on 
the wing.
They were all looking at 
the ball go out wide, and I 
changed my run and was able 
to cut in front of the defenders. Tristan played a great ball 
in, Wysocki said.
The Tartans, playing at 
home, were the faster and 
more composed team, dominating possession and creating 
goal-scoring opportunities.
Moments before his gamewinning goal, Wysocki  after a give-and-go with senior 
forward Max Tassano  had a 
clear shot at goal from the left 
side of the penalty box, only 
for a Geneva defender to de?ect it for a corner.
Tassano also had several 
opportunities to score. In the 
70th minute, his goal off a free 
kick from senior defender Ben 
Bryant was waved offside.
Until Wysockis goal in the 
90th minute, the theme of the 
night was missed chances.
Despite outshooting Geneva 16 to 11 and taking 17 
corner kicks to Genevas six, 
the Tartans were unable to 
convert their chances, as their 
shots ?ew wide or soared 
above the crossbar.
Our guys, for the most 
part, continue to create ample 
opportunities. Because were 
creating opportunities, the 
next step is obviously ?nishing 
them.... But its promising that 
were creating the chances, 
said assistant coach Michael 
Piranian.
Averaging close to 19 shots 
per game, the Tartans have 
scored only one goal in each 
game.
Were clearly creating the 
opportunities, but not ?nishing them, Wysocki said. Im 
sure the goals will come. We 
just got to keep working at it.
The unsung hero of 
Wednesdays game was senior 
keeper Christopher Madden, 
who ?nished with six saves.
In the 53rd minute, Madden made an instinct save on a 
Geneva shot from the left side 
of the box, de?ecting the ball 
wide with his left hand.
[He] did a good job of not 
only communicating with his 
backs, but with his goal kicks 
and punts that were giving us 
a chance to contest, Piranian 
said.
Weve had four shutouts 
so far. [The goalkeepers] are a 
big part of that along with our 
back four, Wysocki said.
Madden posted another 
shutout on Saturday, as the 
Tartans beat Allegheny College 10 on the road.
Tassano scored in the 
34th minute off a pass from 
Wysocki, and the Tartans once 
again dominated the game, 
outshooting Allegheny 155. 
Only two of Alleghenys shots 
were on goal.
The shutout continues the 
Tartans streak of 10 victories 
and improves their record to 
5-1.
The Tartans will next play 
Washington & Jefferson College on the road this Wednesday at 7 p.m.
Mens soccer posts two shutouts and improves to 51

College football is in the 
midst of a dramatic change. 
Major conference realignment is ?nally coming to fruition with the Atlantic Coast 
Conference (ACC) adding 
the University of Pittsburgh 
and Syracuse University, and 
the Big 12 Conference adding 
West Virginia University and 
Texas Christian University 
while losing Texas A&M University to the Southeastern 
Conference.
Pitts move to the ACC was 
bittersweet. They had played 
in the Big East Conference 
since 1982 and were part of 
a legacy of excellence in both 
football and basketball. 
Unfortunately, the Big 
East started as a basketball 
conference, and many of its 
schools did not even have 
football teams. As time went 
on, this con?ict of interest 
eventually led to all of the 
football schools leaving the 
conference, starting in 2004 
when the University of Miami 
and Virginia Tech moved to 
the ACC.
Because of Big East footballs decline in recent years, 
Pitts move to the ACC has 
been rough. Their ACC debut 
came on Labor Day against 
Florida State University. 
Unfortunately for Pitt, this 
was also the debut of redshirt Florida State ?rst-year 
quarterback Jameis Winston. Winston threw for four 
touchdowns and added another rushing score, demolishing the Panthers defense 
with 381 total yards. 
Pittsburgh quarterback 
Tom Savage had a mediocre 
game with one touchdown 
to two interceptions and a 
barely 50 percent completion 
percentage.
This season also marks the 
?nal year of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Currently, the two teams chosen 
for the national championship game are based on the 
BCS rankings, a weighted 
compilation of the Associated Press Poll, the USA Today 
Coaches Poll, and six computer rankings. 
These computer rankings 
have always caused controversy. The algorithms that 
determine the rankings are 
not made public and use different criteria in ranking 
teams.
While the national championship teams may have 
been controversial in the 
past, the defending national 
champions have silenced all 
doubters. The University of 
Alabama has won three of the 
last four national championship games. 
This past Saturday, they 
faced off against the Texas 
A&M Aggies led by Heisman Trophy winner Johnny 
Manziel. Last year, Manziel 
became the ?rst freshman to 
win the Heisman, cementing 
his campaign by handing Alabama their one and only loss 
of the season.
On Saturday, despite setting a school record for passing yards and scoring 42 
points against the intimidating Alabama defense, Manziel was unable to repeat last 
seasons magic, and his Aggies fell to the Crimson Tide, 
4942.
Penn State is two years removed from the unpleasant 
ending of the Joe Paterno era 
and the Jerry Sandusky scandal. Coach Bill OBrien has 
done a fantastic job keeping 
the Nittany Lions from spiraling into irrelevance. 
Unfortunately, there are 
still some growing pains as 
the program recovers from 
the major talent loss following the penalties doled out 
in the wake of the scandal. 
So far, Penn State is picking 
up where they left off after 
last years surprising 84 
campaign. The Nittany Lions 
are 21 against all non-major 
conference schools. Their 
one loss came on Saturday 
against the University of Central Florida.
Despite the loss, Penn 
State showed their will to 
?ght, overcoming an early 
18-point de?cit and bringing the game back to a more 
respectable 3431 ?nish. 
Running back Zach Zwinak 
rushed for 128 yards and 
three touchdowns but hurt 
the Nittany Lion comeback 
efforts with a late fumble.
College football is going 
through a major transition 
period with conference realignment and a new championship-determining method. 
But one thing that hasnt 
changed is the quality of football played every Saturday.

Do you know what time it is?
Redwood Time depicts humorous life of Carnegie Mellon students
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times  
and now its Redwood Time.
Last week marked the launch of Redwood Time, 
a YouTube comedy series produced by Carter 
Redwood, a senior acting major; Jamar Thrasher, 
a masters student in Heinz College; and Clarence 
Williams IV, a junior directing major. Written and 
filmed during the past few months at Carnegie 
Mellon, Redwood Time is a comedic dramatization 
of Redwoods life as an acting major.
The first episode is already on YouTube and features 
Carters encounters with a crazy girlfriend who 
doesnt seem to notice that Carter is not all that into 
her.
Much of the series production is Carnegie Mellonbased. Many of the actors in the series are Carnegie 
Mellon students, and the theme song was written 
and performed by senior business administration 
major Kai Roberts. Redwood, Thrasher, and Williams 
also worked with Jordan Beckman, a local Pittsburgh 
videographer who has directed videos for Wiz 
Khalifa and Mac Miller.
The series has been well promoted on social media 
under #RedwoodTime, and its creators held a 
showing on Sept. 8 in McConomy Auditorium to a 
large audience. The teaser for the series has already 
accumulated over 900 views in one week.
Redwood, who is currently studying abroad at 
Drama Centre London, talked about why he and 
his partners decided to start a YouTube series: 
It started as a way for myself and some of my 
partners to push our creative energy and ideas. The 
funny thing is, it wasnt even my idea to make it 
about me. I was working with Jamar Thrasher and 
Clarence Williams IV, and we sat down and came up 
with the idea to make a web series as a precursor to 
a later film that we planned to make in the summer 
of 2014. So we said in order to build a fan base and 
get our names out, we thought that a web series 
would be a good way to get people to know about us 
and get our creative work out there prior to the film.
He also spoke about the ideas and inspiration 
behind the series: Our inspiration for it was 90s 
sitcoms, including The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, 
Martin, Seinfeld, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. We 
created this character Carter Redwood in this world, 
and we created the Redwood Time universe as well 
as other characters in his life.
Its based on my true life as an actor, he said. 
Carter, like me, is in school, trying to pursue a 
career as an actor, to make it from Pittsburgh to 
Hollywood, but we also created fictional situations 
and characters that are in his world.
When asked about his favorite things about the 
series, Redwood replied, I think its fun that stories 
that happened in my life can be turned into these 
over-the-top stories, that they can make people 
laugh, that Clarences words and Clarences writing 
can heighten it and give it that extra oomph to make 
people engaged in it. The stories and foundations 
come from a real place; the character Carter deals 
with things that I dealt with in real life.
Redwood also discussed the creative process 
of writing the web series: As an artist, there is 
nothing like creating your own work. I feel, as an 
actor, people are constantly trying to impress other 
people in auditions. There are so many people vying 
for one role, and as an artist it gives you a sense 
of freedom to say, I can create my own rules for 
myself. I can collaborate with a team of creative 
teams and artists, and we can create something of 
our own to give ourselves that freedom to make our 
own work and our own art. 
Im interested to see what happens next, if people 
tune in, how this will continue to grow, how it 
will expand, he said. We had the idea, and its 
satisfying to know that we got it out there on the 
web. Weve been successful no matter how many 
people watched.

Dear OH GOD MY 
SENSES,
Have you confronted 
your roommate with this 
problem? If you havent, 
chances are hes not even 
aware that his habits bother 
you; it could just be the 
way he was raised (and 
after all, Carnegie Mellon 
is not exactly known for its 
hygienic student body).
On the other hand, if you 
do talk to him and he is 
obstinate, there is a solution. 
While hes out, take all of 
his laundry and put it in a 
bathtub (or large bucket) 
along with an entire bottle of 
detergent and/or bleach (you 
may want to use a hazmat 
suit for this, and dont be 
afraid to incinerate anything 
that appears to have 
attained sentience). And 
when he gets back, ambush 
him with a garden hose and 
water balloons filled with 
soapy water. Hopefully hell 
get the picture; youll have a 
clean roommate, and youll 
have worked out some of 
your aggression toward him.
May the Tide be with you,

Dear New Patrick(s??),
My RA advised us to go to 
the job fair this week, so I 
worked on my rsum all 
weekend, and I think my 
high school experiences 
will definitely land me 
a job at Facebook. One 
problem: I dont know 
how to tie a tie. Can you 
help me?
Sincerely,
Wondering If Never Done 
Searching Occupation 
Readings, Knowing Not 
Of Ties
Dear WINDSOR KNOT,
In my experience, a job 
interview is all about the first 
impression, and I always 
strive to dress for the job I 
want, which is why I wear 
a snorkel and flippers 
everywhere. As for learning 
to tie a tie, Im sure you can 
ask around. Your RA may 
be willing to tie one for you, 
or ask another floormate. 
Worse comes to worst, 
you can pull a Patrick Jane 
and wear a three-piece suit 
without a tie.
I wouldnt be too sure 
that your high school 
projects will land you a job 
at Facebook. Companies 
tend to value work at the

If you see somebody screaming something like 
JTCHOK-CHOK-CHOK-CHOKTA! with an 
accompanying dance in the next few weeks, dont worry. 
Chances are theyre emulating the musical stylings 
of the Norwegian musical cabaret act known as Ylvis, 
rather than indulging in something thats illegal in the 
state of Pennsylvania.
Ylvis is composed of brothers Brd and Vegard Ylvisker, 
who have performed in Norway since 2000 and have 
since achieved some level of fame in Europe. They 
currently have a show on the Norwegian TV channel 
TVNorge, which is responsible for funding the bigbudget music video for their single The Fox, in which 
the brothers sing about the ethereal beauty of foxes 
and scream nonsensical fox noises at the tops of their 
lungs.
It is probably best to become familiar with this video, 
because it is rapidly gaining popularity to the point that 
incessant references, repostings, and numerous unfunny 
parodies are inevitable.
Is it the next Gangnam Style? Most likely not. The heir 
to the Harlem Shake crown? Luckily, its doubtful that 
the video will become that ubiquitous. Its a shame that 
Ylvis will probably be remembered for giving the world 
a single clever video, because the rest of their work that 
has been translated into English is top-shelf comedy.
Their songs Pressure and Work It both poke fun at 
the upscale hip-hop scene. Work It is an explicit song 
whose humor comes from a complete lack of sexiness. 
While one brother lays down the innuendo, the other 
explains the actual meaning of his every phrase and 
provides anatomical information and the specs for their 
hot tub. In Pressure, the brothers discuss the need for 
proper amounts of pressure in situations ranging from 
popping balloons to negotiating a peace treaty in the 
Middle East.
Speaking of the Middle East, theres also Jan Egeland, 
a Bruce Springsteen-style power ballad about the 
United Nations Super Hero Man, whose peacekeeping 
efforts are known in the U.S. only to the most avid news 
readers. In Stonehenge, one member of the duo is so 
obsessed with the mysteries of the titular artifact that 
intimate moments with his wife are ?lled with expletiveladen musings on its origins.
The crown jewel of their work  unless you know either 
Norwegian or Russian, in which case Janym might 
be glorious  is Someone Like Me. It starts out as a 
traditional love song straight out of a Disney musical, 
only to suddenly become something else entirely that 
still manages to be heartwarming. Kinda.
So if you have a thing for clever songs or Norwegian 
comedy, de?nitely track down the Ylvis playlist on the 
of?cial TVNorge YouTube channel.

Kingdom Hearts revives childhood memories
The classic game gets remastered into a more colorful version of the 2002 original
There are those games from your childhood that you play, 
have fun with, and then never pick up again. And then 
there are those games that stick with you for your entire 
life, altering the way you play and perceive video games 
and perhaps your life itself.
Kingdom Hearts is one of those games. Originally 
released in 2002, it was re-released this past week, 
along with Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories 
and Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days, in a high-de?ntion 
compilation dubbed Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.
Kingdom Hearts is widely considered one of the best 
action RPGs out there, and one of the ?rst to get the 
formula right. It follows the story of a young, impossibly 
optimistic boy named Sora and his lost friends, Riku and 
Kairi. In his travels, Sora encounters many characters 
from the Disney and Square Enix universes (the 
distributor and developer of the game, respectively), 
both familiar and not-so-familiar, while battling enemies 
unique to the series known as the Heartless.
Sora travels to worlds based on a handful of Disney 
movies  Tarzan, Alice in Wonderland, and Hercules, 
to name a few. The combat involves a lot of buttonmashing, but there is some skill required. Sora does not 
always ?ght alone, though; he is joined by Donald Duck 
and Goofy both in combat and through most of the game. 
In almost all of the worlds, Sora gets a new companion 
unique to that world  usually the main character from 
the movie the world is based upon.
Even with the backing of these characters, though, it 
is a dif?cult game at times  something I am happy to 
admit. In fact, having beaten Kingdom Hearts more than 
a handful of times, I still had trouble not dying in the 
early hours of the game. The platforming has remained 
steadfastly frustrating at times, but feels a bit more 
forgiving now  though perhaps its just the bigger 
screen. The non-linearity of the game is surprisingly 
hard to get past sometimes as well, but it leads to a more 
rewarding explorative experience.
This is not the original Kingdom Hearts you loved and 
grew up with. It is the ?nal mix  a re-release that, 
until last Tuesday, only existed in Japan. The changes 
from the original are mostly cosmetic  many enemies 
are now recolored to brighter versions of their previous 
selves  though there are some items and enemies 
thrown in for additional rewards and challenges, as well 
as a particularly notorious boss battle.
Also, the remastered visuals and audio look and sound 
incredible. While it is clear at times that certain textures 
are taken straight from the original, without much 
touching up, the character models look as good as you 
remember the PlayStation 2 ones looking.
Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories, the direct sequel 
to Kingdom Hearts, has been updated in similar ways, 
though the game itself has not changed much from 
its PlayStation 2 incarnation, which itself was actually 
a reincarnation of a GameBoy Advance game. The 
games combat system is a complete departure from 
the original, using cards to decide Soras moves instead 
of an on-screen attack menu. The scope of the game is 
also slightly more limited: Although Sora visits different 
worlds, they are all the same ones as he visited in the 
?rst game, and everything takes place inside a single 
castle.
However, the sequel offers you the chance to play as 
the somewhat enigmatic Riku and his inner battle with 
his obsession of power and evil. That said, the story 
takes a much darker turn from the original game, as 
both Riku and Sora take up arms against a new group of 
antagonists known as the Organization. This is the ?rst 
game to include the deaths of characters, too.
The most interesting re-release in the set, however, 
is Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days. Originally released 
for the Nintendo DS in 2009, it is now presented in 
this collection as almost three hours of video footage, 
completely remastered from the original game. It 
presents side-stories and back-stories to many of the 
characters that appear both in Chain of Memories and 
Kingdom Hearts 2. And it must be said that the tale in 
cinematic format is just as heart-wrenching (though 
some would say clich) as it was as a game.
What started out as pure conjecture  the idea of 
making a Disney game that could rival Nintendos Mario 
games in popularity  has ended up a hallmark game of 
a hallmark series. These games have not changed much 
since their initial release, and picking up the control still 
brings you right back to your couch all those years ago. 
It still evokes the same senses of wonder, mystery, and 
fascination as it did when we were kids.

Star Trek
An incredible revival of the classic series, Star Trek 
captures all the wonder and endless entertainment 
of Star?eet. Film juggernaut J.J. Abrams manages 
to create an entertaining prequel without banking on 
nostalgia. Chris Pine and Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
Zachary Quinto ground the story with humanity and 
friendship despite their contrasting personas as Captain 
Kirk and Spock.
Lawrence of Arabia
Lawrence of Arabia is a masterful landmark of 
?lmmaking history. The story ventures out into the 
Middle Eastern front during World War I as seen through 
the eyes of T.E. Lawrence, who battles with both the 
world he sees and with his own identity. Full of glorious 
landscapes and fueled by a powerful story, Lawrence of 
Arabia mercilessly begets majesty. With his piercing blue 
eyes, Peter OToole offers one of the most compelling 
performances in the role that made him a star.
Star Trek: Into Darkness
The Enterprise is back and better than ever. 
With J.J. Abrams back to lead this ship, Into 
Darkness is a surprisingly fresh sequel that not 
only avoids the traps most franchises fall into 
but surpasses other summer blockbusters 
with ridiculous thrill rides and an amazing cast. 
Benedict Cumberbatch roars as the antagonist 
but also boldly makes us question the de?nition 
of a terrorist.

We saw a lot of great new music this summer  Daft 
Punks Random Access Memories, Queens of the Stone 
Ages ...Like Clockwork, and Kanye Wests Yeezus  but 
theres a lot more just around the corner thats worth 
getting excited about. So grab your pumpkin spice latte, 
put on your sweater, and settle in for this fall music 
preview.
MGMT - MGMT
Release date: Sept. 17
MGMT won everyone over in 2008 with their debut 
album Oracular Spectacular, which spawned the hits 
Time To Pretend, Kids, and Electric Feel and 
introduced mainstream music to psychedelic pop. 
With their follow-up, Congratulations, MGMT decided 
to challenge their listeners with meandering electric 
soundscapes and a lack of catchy melodies. With this 
upcoming third album, MGMT is staying true to that 
course. 
Lead single Your Life Is A Lie is rough around the 
edges in terms of production and features a cacophony 
of different noises blending into a collage of sound. 
Though it seems that MGMT will never go back to the 
kind of music they put out ?ve years ago, Im anxiously 
awaiting to see what new twists and turns they have in 
store for us.
Arcade Fire - Re?ektor
Release date: Oct. 29
Arcade Fire is a band with a ?rm belief in quality over 
quantity. Over the past 10 years, it has released only 
three full-length albums, all of which have become 
modern classics (2004s Funeral, 2007s Neon Bible, and 
2010s The Suburbs).
According to Pitchfork.com, details regarding its 
upcoming fourth album are scarce, beyond talk of 
supposed help from David Bowie and James Murphy (of 
LCD Soundsystem). The ?rst single, Re?ektor, shows 
in?uence of disco as well as old prog-rock vinyls from 
the bands childhood. So far, Arcade Fire hasnt released 
an album that isnt fantastic, and each one actually 
surpasses the one before it. If the bands current album 
trajectory holds true, this release should be one of the 
best of the year.
Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP II
Release date: Nov. 5
Deep down in his heart of hearts, Eminem wishes it 
could be 2002 forever. Back in the day, he was the most 
dangerous man in America, shattering the innocence 
of a generation of fourth-graders who didnt understand 
intercourse because they didnt have the Discovery 
Channel.
Today, though, hes a big boring story of redemption, a 
man who makes music that both mother and daughter 
can agree with (Love The Way You Lie, etc.). Evidently 
this doesnt sit well with the rapper-songwriter, so hes 
decided to bleach his hair once again and provide a 
follow-up to his high water mark, The Marshall Mathers 
LP.
Based on the lead single, Berzerk, one can expect a 
Relapse-level attempt at trying to still be cool, but itll 
feel just a bit more pathetic this time. Im just hoping 
he includes a Kim II, because Eminem always sounds 
genuine when rapping about killing his ex-wife.
Cults - Static
Release date: Oct. 15
Anyone who remembers that catchy Go Outside 
song from a couple of years ago  and a lot of people 
should, because it was in about a million commercials 
 knows Cults. However, many of these people may not 
have listened to its entire debut album. If they did, they 
wouldve known that Cults are much more than a onesong band.
Based on lead single I Can Hardly Make You Mine, it 
appears Cults arent shying away from digging a little 
deeper and making music that sounds darker, while still 
retaining their poppy gleam. I look forward to hearing 
what theyve come up with; their debut showed a 
band with a lot of promise, and hopefully they continue 
expanding their sound rather than getting caught up in 
trying to replicate the success of Go Outside.
Danny Brown - Old
Release date: Sept. 30
Danny Brown is ridiculous and fun; anyone looking for 
some light-hearted, graphic misogyny should just listen 
to his collaboration with trap producers Flosstradamus, 
From The Back. He established his reputation in 2011 
with the independently released XXX, but with his 
major-label debut on the horizon (Brown is signed to 
A-Traks Fools Gold label), hes determined to make it 
clear that hes here to stay.
According to Pitchfork.com, theres a long list of 
collaborators reported to appear, including Schoolboy 
Q, Ab-Soul, and Charli XCX. Browns song with A$AP 
Rocky, Kush Coma, has already been released and 
will also appear on the album. From the ?rst listen its 
abundantly clear that Old will be on repeat in foggy 
Honda Civics for years to come.
Kings of Leon - Mechanical Bull
Release date: Sept. 24
Alright, a quick disclaimer: Im a huge fan of the ?rst 
two, heavily southern-rock in?uenced Kings of Leon 
albums, Youth & Young Manhood and Aha Shake 
Heartbreak. But beginning with 2007s Because of the 
Times, there has been a steady decline in the quality of 
the bands output as it stray furthers and further from its 
garage-rock beginnings.
If lead single Supersoaker is any indication, however, 
the Kings have traded in the champagne for Miller Lite 
and are having fun again. Singer Caleb Followills voice 
once again has that Southern drawl that got lost in the 
high-end production of their last two albums, and Matt 
Followill goes back to the jangly lead parts we came to 
love in Taper Jean Girl and The Bucket. Hopefully 
Kings of Leon dont disappoint with this one, for it could 
mean a renewal for a band that looked like it had run its 
course.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the ?rst and 
second seasons of New Girl.
Fans of Zooey Deschanel know that the popular and 
 according to FOX  adorkable TV show New Girl 
will resume with its third season this Tuesday at 9 p.m. 
The second season ?nale left us with Ceces (Hannah 
Simone) three-hour traditional Indian wedding, during 
which she left her ?anc Shivrang (Satya Bhabha) and 
acknowledged her feelings for Schmidt (Max Green?eld). 
Unfortunately for Cece, Schmidt had renewed his 
relationship with Elizabeth (Merritt Wever), his college 
girlfriend, after he and Cece broke up. Confronted by the 
choice between Cece and Elizabeth, Schmidt literally ran 
away.
Meanwhile, Jess (Deschanel) and Nick (Jake Johnson) 
?ounder at the possibility of having something more 
than friendship, and Winston (Lamorne Morris)... well, 
Winston provides comic relief.
This drama leads to two main questions that FOX has 
indicated will be answered during the upcoming season: 
Who will Schmidt pick? And will Nick and Jess become 
a real couple? On its website, FOX has also revealed 
that Winston will get serious about taking control of his 
own love life, hinting that he might ?nally get his own 
storyline.
Returning guest stars include Brenda Song, who played 
Winstons girlfriend Daisy in the past season, as well as 
Damon Wayans Jr., known on the show as Coach. He 
left after the shows pilot episode to star in the show 
Happy Endings, but he returns to New Girl following the 
cancellation of Happy Endings.
In an interview with tvline.com, Morris indicated that 
Daisy will appear in only one episode, con?rming 
suspicions that Winston and Daisy will break up. Coach 
is rumored to be in at least four episodes this season. 
New guest stars include Angela Kinsey from The Of?ce, 
Eva Amurri from Californication, and Dreama Walker 
from Dont Trust the B---- in Apartment 23. The three 
are set to play a clique of mean girl teachers at the 
new school where Jess will begin working in the second 
episode of season three. This episode, titled Jacooz 
will feature Jess seeking Nicks advice on how to ?t in 
with the cool teachers, Schmidt at an of?ce party gone 
wrong, and Winston suspecting Daisy of cheating on 
him.
What about the ?rst episode? The promo video shows 
Jess and Nick crossing the border into Mexico and 
getting in trouble there, while Schmidt tells both 
Elizabeth and Cece separately that hed like to be with 
them. It has the potential to be funny, but if the writers 
have only planned the third season to focus on lingering 
problems from the second, it can quickly become bland. 
Jess and Nick can only be an awkward couple for so 
long. This leads to the question of what would happen if 
their relationship does, in fact, work out.
Some of the most entertaining episodes in the past have 
centered on Jesss love life, ranging from the time she 
has to pick up her things from ex-boyfriend Spencers 
house to when she tries to prepare a Thanksgiving meal 
for fellow teacher Paul, whom she had been dating. Nick 
and Jesss relationship has been moving quite slowly 
so far, and the writers need to change things up. The 
same goes with Schmidts relationships. Though the 
show might still be funny, the writers need to vary the 
storylines to make sure that it remains interesting.

Walking around Pittsburghs North Side 35 years ago 
was a completely different experience than it is today; 
back then, the area was still segregated and rife with 
crime and drug activity.
Not so much today. Now safe and host to a diverse 
artistic community, the North Side has gone through 
signi?cant changes in recent decades. Some of that 
change is thanks to the establishment and growth of the 
Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum focused 
on site-speci?c installation work that dates back to 1975.
The Mattress Factory, located at 500 Sampsonia Way, 
began its 35th-anniversary celebration in February with 
a series of community parties. The festivities continue 
this month with the opening of two new exhibits: 
Detroit: Artists in Residence, and Within, an exhibit by 
New York City-based contemporary artist Janine Antoni.
History and Growth of the Mattress Factory
When Barbara Luderowski, a sculptor and architecture 
enthusiast, saw an empty mattress warehouse on 
Pittsburghs North Side in 1975, she saw the potential 
for a brighter future for the area. Luderowski bought the 
building that year for $10,000 and created a space for 
artists and intellectuals to live and work as a community 
 and thus launched the Mattress Factory.
In 1977, the organization became a nonpro?t 
corporation, and ?ve years later premiered its ?rst 
exhibition of installation art. Since then, the museum 
has exhibited the work of over 600 artists from around 
the world and is currently home to 17 permanent 
installations, including creations of American light and 
space artist James Turrell, Japanese installation artist 
Yayoi Kusama, American sculptor Greer Lankton, British 
sculptor Bill Woodrow, and American painter William 
Anastasi.
The Mattress Factory has a history of embracing change 
and encouraging engagement with technology, museum 
patrons, and the surrounding community.
The museum has been an early adopter of innovative 
technologies. In 2009, it became the ?rst museum in 
the U.S. to use QR codes to engage visitors with more 
information about the exhibits while reducing waste 
from printed materials. It also has a Facebook page and 
a Twitter account.
The Mattress Factory has worked hard to become a wellrespected institution in the surrounding neighborhood. 
Having the Mattress Factory here in a residential 
neighborhood has been a big catalyst for change, said 
Alexis Tragos, the museums director of development. 
Since its opening, the museum has acquired and 
renovated two other buildings for exhibitions and others 
for educational spaces and artist residences, bringing 
jobs to the neighborhood and encouraging even more 
people to visit. We are a magnet for people who are 
traveling from outside of Pittsburgh to come and visit, 
Tragos said. Its a very unique attraction.
Despite these many changes, however, the museum 
has sought to remain close to the history of the 
neighborhood. With each renovation, the museum has 
chosen to keep the previous buildings faade in order 
to blend with existing architecture. Even when artists 
want to change the structure of a building  Sarah 
Oppenheimers piece 610-3356 created an opening 
in the fourth ?oor of the gallery that gives visitors a 
direct line of sight out of a third-?oor wall and into a 
neighboring yard  the Mattress Factory has kept at 
least part of the original appearance in place.
Installations of extreme proportions, such as 
Oppenheimers work, are not often encouraged by 
museums, but this type of experimentalism is at the 
core of what the Mattress Factory does. Since its 
establishment, the Mattress Factory has presented itself 
as a place where artists are encouraged to pursue ideas 
that may originally seem impossible. When an artist 
has a big idea, we make it happen, Tragos said.
Detroit: Artists in Residence
The main museum building houses the ?rst of the two 
exhibits that opened last Thursday. Detroit: Artists 
in Residence features recent work by four artists and 
two collaborations, all based in Detroit. According to 
a museum press release, the artists were chosen after 
a trip to the city that inspired museum co-directors 
Luderowski and Michael Olijnyk.
The artists reactions to the swift socioeconomic 
changes in Detroit, and their making of work in an 
environment burgeoning with opportunity, align with

Detroit comes to Pittsburgh for the 35th-anniversary celebration of the Mattress Factory
Detroit: Artists in Residence features alternative, experimental, thought-provoking exhibits from urban artists at a historically forward-thinking museum of contemporary installation art
Visitors gather in the lobby of the main Sampsonia Way location of the Mattress Factory as part of the museums 
35th-anniversary celebration, which launched two new exhibits on Thursday night.
                Jonathan Carreon | Contributing Editor
by Allison Cosby | Staffwriter[]the Mattress Factorys mission of encouraging artists 
to experiment and take risks, the press release said. 
Such edgy creativity and entrepreneurship remind 
Luderowski and Olijnyk of the same spirit at play during 
the founding of the Mattress Factory on Pittsburghs 
North Side 35 years ago.
Indeed, the six works that comprise the exhibit show 
tremendous variety and creativity, often incorporating 
external elements and city-speci?c cues.
One of the artists whose work is displayed here, 
Jessica Frelinghuysen, built her entire piece out of 
such external elements. In her work My City is Your 
City, Frelinghuysen examines personal and shared 
experiences in close communities through an audio and 
visual representation of her life in Hamtramck, Mich., a 
two-square-mile city almost entirely surrounded by the 
city of Detroit.
The installation is a room full of tree-like structures built 
from alley wood and tin cans. Hold a can up to your 
ear, and you hear a sound  people talking about their 
heritage or life story, the sound of trains going by, clips 
from a live music performance  that Frelinghuysen 
collected from the area.
Frelinghuysens piece also includes the uniform she 
wore while collecting these sounds: a backpack with her 
audio recording equipment and a bright blue jumpsuit 
complete with a pierogi-warming pocket. The piece 
encourages visitors to listen to these peoples voices 
in order to better relate to a small community and the 
sounds that surround them every day.
Wandering into the next room, visitors are presented 
with the faade of a house, complete with two doors 
and a few exterior lights. From behind the doors, 
hammers, electric saws, and even human screams can 
be heard. A visitor who enters through one of the doors 
?nds themselves in the midst of Nicola Kuperus and 
Adam Lee Millers psychological game: a piece titled 
Diptyching.
The room features a full-wall projection of a video of 
Kuperus and Miller, which shows the artists as they 
build the faade, watch it fall, and then take it apart. 
The video was made in the museum, and the artists 
rebuilt the piece after the ?lming with the video aspect 
built in.
According to the press release, the installation is 
intended to be a visceral, confusing, and destabilizing 
experience, and it absolutely is. The video is part 
comedy  complete with campy splashes of obviously 
fake blood  and part meaningful performance, where 
the repetition of scenes and sounds creates a truly 
disorienting environment. Watching the builders 
experience injuries in the building process is funny 
until the incessant barrage of these images starts to 
hurt. With this piece, Kuperus and Miller create a surreal 
world that is both comedic and grotesque, as funny as it 
is painful.
This unsettling, fun-house feeling continues throughout 
the exhibit. Another room features 1913 Revisited 
in Three Parts, a piece by Frank Pahl that takes the 
visitor back in time to a world of mechanical devices 
and complex instruments. The installation is peaceful 
and nostalgic, but can feel very surreal. Changing lights 
cast odd shadows across the machines, and the rooms 
soundtrack distorts the visitors sense of time. Without 
being overly stylized, the piece  through both its title 
and actual construction  creates an environment for 
the viewer to meditate on the passing of time.
In the museums basement is one of the most surprising 
and confusing pieces of the Detroit exhibit: Scott 
Hockings Coronal Mass Ejection. This piece features a 
replica of a rusted 35-foot-long hot metal train car (called 
a torpedo or submarine car) surrounded by sculptures 
in various stages of worship, some human and some 
featuring dinosaur-like add-ons to their heads.
The piece is partially about worshipping things beyond 
our understanding, Hocking said. The mysteriousness 
of the industrial artifact combined with the religious 
aspect of its worshippers leads to questions about 
various mythologies and creation amd destruction 
myths. This came from me thinking about how our 
artifacts will be interpreted in the future when theyre 
found by others, Hocking said. Theres mystery 
involved in religion, in archeology, and in science.
The exhibit also features pieces by Russ Orlando, as well 
as a collaboration between Gina Reichert and Mitch 
Cope. Cured, Orlandos piece, explores the notion of 
healing a city, preserving what has de?ned it, slowing 
down time, making things last, according to the gallery 
guide. It explores a butchers practice of curing, but 
instead of meats, metal car parts hang from chains and 
meat hooks suspended from the ceiling. The metals are 
covered in salt and are displayed in various stages of 
preservation and deconstruction.
Reichert and Copes piece, titled Following The Sun 2, 
is an installation encouraging research and re?ection on 
environmental in?uences. Visitors can directly observe 
real-time wind and solar activity through carefully 
placed warming rocks, video screens, and other natural 
elements, with a focus on the use of direct current 
electricity.
Detroit is well suited for the 35th anniversary of the 
museum, as its displays encourage a high level of visitor 
participation and artistic creativity. These six pieces 
explore six completely different settings and ideas, but 
the underlying themes of the city itself have informed 
each work and thereby allow for a uni?ed exhibit.
