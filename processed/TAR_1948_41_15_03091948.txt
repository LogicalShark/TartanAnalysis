VOL. 41No. 15CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1948
Early End Seen For 
Senior Interview Rush
Incorrect Job Shortage Fear Causes 
Trouble; Sufficient Of fers Expected
Yes, were rushed right now, but I expect that the worst will be 
over within a few weeks as the seniors realize that the employment 
problem is not as bad as they feared it would be, said Charles E. 
.'Wangeman, head of the Bureau of Placements last week.
He was explaining the crowds that have been milling around 
the Bureau of Placements office, IH 155-A during recent days.
; Many of the seniors have heard a lot about how difficult th 
finding of jobs will be this year,* 
he continued, and as a result we
have a rush every time a list goes 
up for a particular interview. 
Graduates Can Expect Offers
However, I feel that the sup
ply of good, technically trained 
mefl has not outrun the demand 
and that all of CITs 1948 gradi 
uates can expect a number of of
fers of employment.
Selective recruiting on the part 
of the companies has come back 
into the picture, he explained, 
and employers are taking a good 
deal of care in hiring their men.
When asked about the steps be
ing taken by his office to handle 
the unusually large number of 
seniors this year he replied, We 
have been desperately looking 
for some way to handle the large 
demand for positions on the in
terview lists, but thus far we have 
been unable to discover any that 
are practicable.
Mr. Wangeman noted that the 
space and staff available to the 
Bureau made impossible the ac
commodation of more than four, 
or at the most, five, interviewers each day.
Bureau Operations Explained
In a further explanation of the 
operations of the Bureau, Mr. 
Wangeman said, A factor that is 
often overlooked by the students 
is that we do much more than 
merely handling their interviews, 
Roughly 40 percent of our job con
sists of helping alumni, who al
ways present a more difficult prob
lem; Our correspondence too, re
quires a tremendous amount of 
time, so that in the few months 
of the interviewing season we 
have an extraordinarily large volume of work.
To two of the questions most
frequently asked of the depart
mentWhy dont the interview
ers stay longer and Why dont 
the companies send out more in
terviewers?Mr. Wangeman re
plied that the interviewers have a 
definite schedule to keep, which 
forces them to move on after only 
a very short time at CIT, and that 
the companies dont feel that they 
can spare additional interview
ers.
To the suggestion that the in
terview length be shortened, he 
answered: The companies set[Continued on page 2]

Spring Carnival Plans Revealed; 
Everything Set But The Weather
Recent hints of springwith 
those scattered warm days and 
talk of Easter vacationbring im
mediately to mind that biggest of 
all weekends, Spring Carnival.
Plans and arrangements by 
Omicron Delta Kappa, senior 
mens activities honorary, were 
being formulated long before the 
first hardy soul walked across the 
Cut in just a sweater. Will Hawk
ins and his Carnival committee 
have been working religiously 
since last summer to make this 
Spring Carnival all that it prom
ises to be. They have everything 
organized but the weather and it 
all looks good.
Scotch and Soda Club has been 
equally active. Their musical re
view, The Ladys At Work, will 
begin the long week end and their
fourth and final performance on 
Thursday night will coincide with 
the opening of the Midway.
Booths, replete with streamers, 
wheels of fortune, traditional 
ware and prizes, and always col
orful barkers will compete for at
tention with the ferris wheel, 
merry-go-round and octopus.
Popcorn, hot dogs, and candy 
floss will tempt every appetite 
whetted by Skibo fare. Combined 
with the traditional fraternity 
and dormitory refreshments, the 
best regulated of constitutions will 
be well tested.
Ideas for floats for the big pa
rade are beginning to take form. 
New designs, pointed toward the 
best designed and the winning 
racer prizes, are being discussed 
and the handymen in each organi
zation are ready to go to work on
pushmobiles to compete in the 
hilly sweepstakes race.
Sororities, otherwise engaged, 
are grooming candidates for the 
all-school lection of the Queen 
and her court of seven.
Canoe tilting teams are getting 
ready for the first practice spills in 
the waters of Panther Hollow, and 
are looking forward to a stream
lined, more closely controlled set 
of contests.
And, finally two of the more 
danceable name bands in the 
country are being selected and 
contracted for the informal Friday 
night dance and the formal ball 
on Saturday. The decoration com
mittee for the dances is ready to 
dress up the Gym about a theme 
which will be kept secret until 
Carnival time.
Led by Citcom Clan and FAC, the independent forces 
are gathering strength for the Thursday, March 11, Student 
Council election.
In memory of the overwhelming victory scored by the 
fraternity candidates at the December 18 election, a success 
which was suddenly nullified when the leaders of IAC dis
covered errors in the elections procedure and forced former
Council president George Mar
shall to void the entire balloting, 
the leaders of the latter organiza
tion are attempting to obtain 374 
votes for their candidates.
This figure was determined by 
mathematical computation as be
ing the minimum number needed 
to assure the election of their can
didates.
Observers have predicted that 
the Independent Action Commit
tee will achieve its goal, and that 
the first session of the new Coun
cil will find the present meager 
independent representation there 
materially reinforced.
Other Issues Enter
Other issues not of a purely 
political nature, however, are al
so expected to influence the elec
tion results.
When asked the question: What 
is the best single improvement 
that yoii can suggest to make 
Council a more effective student 
government?, most of the can
didates agreed that school spirit 
and student interest in campus 
activities should be encouraged, 
that more Council support of ac
tivities is needed, and that closer cooperation between Council and 
the Administration is necessary. 
Individuals Answer 
Individual answers to this ques
tion were as follows:John W. Anderson, Sr., EE: 
Create an active interest among 
the students regarding their rights 
and responsibilities as members of 
this campus.Walter Blenko, Soph., ME: 
The best solution for improving 
student government at Tech is for 
all students to take part in the 
school activities.William A. Bourke, Jr., EE; 
The need is the same as in all 
levels of government on and off 
campus: the development of a 
proper attitude by the participants 
in that government so that their 
decisions will favor that which 
is most beneficial to the entire 
group.
Richard Crain, Jr., Chem E: 
Better student government would

Citcom Drops 
Specific Ticket
Backs Off, Will Back 
No Single Candidates
Citcom Clan will not support a 
bi-partisan ticket of fraternity 
men and independents in the 
March 11 Student Council election.
Weve backed off, said Jack 
Ewart, recently elected Clan pres
ident. We are not supporting any 
fraternity men, but neither are 
we backing any specific independ
ents.
Citcom suggests to the campus 
at large that it use its own judg
ment in voting, keeping but one 
reservation in-mind: When an independent and a fraternity man 
are of equivalent ability, then the 
vote should be cast for the inde
pendent.
Ewart explained that since the 
fraternity election system guar
antees its candidates a certain 
number of votes, the independents, 
lacking this safe backlog, must de
pend upon the students as a whole 
to be elected.
Stating that Citcoms actions 
do not constitute a basic change in 
policy, he reiterated his organiza
tions belief in elections conduct
ed on an individual basis, in 
which a mans political affiliations 
do not enter into the balloting. 
Ewart called the present change 
in method of application of pol
icy necessary under the present 
conditions.
The fraternity election system 
will continue to support only fra
ternity candidates in the Thurs
day election.
For us to support candidates 
of the fraternity machine would 
be unwise.
Crago Asks 
For Larger 
Representation
Both sides of the political fence 
must be represented on Student 
Council if the student government 
is to mean much to the campus, 
stated Robert Crago, Scobellite 
chairman of IAC, on Friday aft
ernoon in a statement of his or
ganizations policy in connection 
with the March 11 election.
In order that the independents 
may obtain something close to 
equitable representation, he said, 
they must obtain 374 votes.
Crago announced that Robert 
Fulton, editor of the Citcommentator, has been added to the pre
vious IAC slate of Councilman J. 
K. OHare, John Anderson, and 
William Johns.5 [Continued on page 2]

Ground will be broken for 
the new sychro-cyclotron at 
the former KDKA transmitter 
location, one mile south of 
Saxonburg on Saxonburg 
boulevard, at 3 p. m., Friday,

Editorial
One More Chance
The Thursday Student Council election 
has enjoyed as much advance notice as any
one could possibly wish.
The first election, on December 18, was 
called void after the independents had dug 
themselves out from a snowstorm of pro-fra
ternity ballots and discovered a few minor 
procedural errors which were adjudged suf
ficient to call the snowstorm illegal.
The circumstances attending these events, 
the subsequent alterations in the independent 
platforms, and the names and a statement 
from each of the present candidates have been 
reported in the Tartan as fully as space has 
permitted.
We now call upon the independent leaders 
to bring out a vote in proportion to the potentiaf strength of their several parties and 
thus assume an important place in Student 
Council.
Failing this, the best the independent par
ties can do is to admit that their lethargy is 
both inherent and permanent and not just a 
condition induced by the evils of fraternity 
rule which needs only a removal of this con
dition to enable more students to take part 
in a full school life.
Employment Trouble
Obtaining a good job in the field of their 
choice is the reason behind the presence of 
most students in the College of Engineering 
and Science.
Giving the graduating students the best 
possible help in obtaining such jobs is a pri
mary responsibility of the Administration. 
This responsibility is not now being fulfilled.
The Bureau of Placements is probably ade
quate to handle the normal load of graduat
ing students in the proper manner. But the 
present class is sufficiently large to have ser
iously impaired its functioning.
In some departments, relatively few stu
dents have obtained interviews so far, and 
prospects for the 'future appear to be poor.
The job market has tightened up appreci
ably, and while just any job can still be ob
tained, getting something which you really 
want has become uncomfortably difficult.
Seniors race each other to join the jost
ling crowd in the Bureau office when each 
class is over, hoping to put their name on some 
list, any list of interviews being given by a

Right Face!
---------- By Robert Charpie---------
XDig, Buddy!
Election time rolls around again and we might 
as well brace ourselves for the usual Tartan head
line, Independents Protest as Fraternities Sweep 
Council Election!!! How many times in the past 
have we been plagued with the same old tun?
Its high time that the Tartans readers slant 
on this subject was changed. The Independents 
deserve to lose this election and every other elec
tion at CIT until they realize that griping is no 
substitute for hard work.
There are about 3500 students registered at the 
present time in the day school. Of this number 
something like 650 students are fraternity mem
bers. Simple subtraction shows that the Inde
pendents outnumber the fraternity men by almost 
5 to 1.
Now take a glance at the composition of the 
membership of the activities. I assure you that 
whether you choose to talk about sports, publi
cations, or just activities in general you will find 
that the fraternity men constitute not 1/6 of the 
activities group but more nearly one-half.
I cannot understand the continual charges that 
the organized minority hurts the school by acting 
in its own behalf, when, in point of fact, the or
ganized minority IS the major interest group with
in the school. The highly publicized counter-orga
nizations which the Independents have formed 
from time to time have failed to even dent the 
fraternity armor. With a 5-1 majority to draw 
from, perhaps this is indicative of the efficiency 
we might expect from an all independent student 
councilperish the thought.
It would be useless brick-bat throwing to even 
intimate that some of the non-fraternity men are 
not as capable %s the best the fraternities can 
offer. However, a little less protesting and a little 
more constructive action on the part of the FEW 
interested independents would do a lot more good.
Recently, while sitting in Skibo, I was ap
proached by an independent friend of mine. He 
asked me to sign a petition for him. I explained 
that I had already signed someone elses. He then 
asked the men who were sitting around me to 
sign for him. One in particular bluntly refused, 
saying, Dont bother me, cant you see Im play
ing bridge?
Afterward I asked this bridge player if he 
had any reason for not signing the petition. He 
told me that he didnt; rather that he just wasnt 
interested in that sort of stuff. This attitude is 
quite typical of the great majority of the students 
witness the poor turnout at each and every all
school election. And until the independent group 
as a whole wakes up and joins in the activities 
program of the school the best they can expect 
in an election is just what theyve always had 
a poor second place.
Final Advice to Independents: Qujit crying 
about IAC, gentlemen. Until you can show the 
rest of us that the Independents are 5-1 citizens 
of CIT rather than 1/5 squawkers and 4/5 blanks 
you had best all retire to your sanctum sanctorum.
Letter to the Editor:
On Childish Antics
Editor, the Tartan:
American college students generally exhibit a 
good deal of sophistication and intelligence, both 
in and out of the classroom. I object, therefore, 
to that small minority which cast discredit upon 
the entire group by their childish antics in at
tempting to disrupt the Henry Wallace rally last 
week in the Carnegie Music hall.
Had they deliberately gone out to aid the Wal
lace cause, had they wished to deliver a big stack 
of votes to Henry, they could not have hit upon 
a more effective means of putting his cause and 
the martyrdom of his supporters in the lime
light.
Perhaps they wanted to have some fun, or per
haps they thought that they were performing a 
real service to democracy. The first is dangerous, 
the second ridiculous.
Democracy is strengthened by practice, not by 
adopting the tactics and attitudes of those who op
pose it. There is a good deal of danger in using 
such tactics in the name of freedom and democ
racy.
I am certainly no believer in the divinity of 
Henry Wallace, but I admit the possibility that 
neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have a 
monopoly on good ideas.
Rather than dissecting his followers, their lit
erature, their meetings, we should dissect in
stead the idea he professes and the program he 
presents.
Sincerely, 
ROBERT W. JOHNSON, Jr. Mgt.
Overanxious Seniors Complicate 
Placement Bureau Operation
[Continued from page 1] 
the length of the interviews. Most 
interviewers feel that they need 
at least a fifteen minute period 
to evaluate an applicant. If the 
periods were shortened, the com
pany representatives wouid see 
so many men that they would 
leave without a clear picture in 
their minds of any of the men 
they had met. Both the company 
and the undergraduate would feel 
short-changed.
Shopping Discouraged
Although the Bureau once ad
vocated that the seniors shop 
through as many interviews as 
possible, that practice is being 
discouraged this year because 
there are so many men to be plac
ed.
In fact, Mr. Wangeman promis
ed that those who are obviously 
shopping and crowding other 
men out of interview lists by ap
pearing on more than their fair 
share will be called in shortly to 
explain. The students must be 
fair to their classmates.
In previous years the practice 
of the Bureau was to interview 
every senior and thus prepare him 
to meet the company representa
tives. The size of this years class 
precluded such a program, but 
Mr. Wangemans assistant, Mr. 
Robert B. Savin, attempted to 
make up the deficiency by dis
cussing with the seniors in each 
department, as a group, the prob
lems they will face in their inter
viewing.
Other Schools Troubled Too
We have been aware for a long 
time of the composite nature of i 
this problem, Mr. Wangeman /
said, and we have been search
ing everywhere for a solution, 
but we have found that other 
schools are having exactly the 
same sort of difficulties and are 
searching in vain for a solution 
just as we are. We would cer
tainly like to find a way to take 
care of everybody.
Cooperation Asked 
In a final word to those who 
frequent his office, he said, We 
will do everything in our power 
to aid the seniors in getting jobs, 
in return for which we merely 
ask that they help us to help 
them by treating their fellow stu
dents fairly, by replying promptly 
when we communicate with them, 
and by informing us when they 
accept a position.

[Continued from page I]
Our hope is that the changes 
in election procedure effected by 
Student Council at the suggestion 
of IAC will result in a more active 
participation in' the elections by 
all groups.
IAC has no desire to stand as 
a separate political party of any 
sort. One of its primary purposes, 
in fact, is to eliminate friction be
tween opposing factions and thus 
enable more students to take part 
in a full school life.
In reviewing the last election 
which was set aside on action be
gun by IAC on the basis of tech
nical irregularities, Crago stated 
emphatically:
It should be remembered that 
the students do not have to vote 
for every position open. A good 
policy would be to vote only for 
people you know.

TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1948THE CARNEGIE TARTAN8
Liaison Group Works 
On Test For Teachers
Evaluation Of Teaching Success 
Is Primary Committee Objective
Setting as its immediate goal 
the determination of a method for 
helping Carnegie Tech instructors 
to judge their teaching effective
ness, the re-activated StudentFaculty Liaison committee in the 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence held its first meeting of the 
present year on February 25 in 
Director Jones office.
Joining holdover students Ern
est Snoyer and Richard Eschenbach on the committee are new 
members Philip Birnbaum, Rich
ard Cutkosky, John Grace, Rob
ert Johnson, Clark Sloan, and Ed
ward Von Halle. They were se
lected as a representa&ve group 
from the college on the basis of 
their interest and high scholar
ship.
The present project began when 
a group led by John Grace drew 
up a test for instructors to give 
to their classes to determine the 
strong and weak points of their 
teaching techniques.
The test was turned over by 
Grace to Professers B. von Haller 
Gilmer and Harry W. Karn of the 
department of psychology, each 
of whom, on an experimental 
basis, gave the test to two of his 
sections at the end of the Fall 
semester.
The content of these tests and 
the general results formed the 
basis of the discussions which en
sued at the meeting on February 
25.
Representing the faculty at this 
meeting were Dr. Jones, Professors Gilmer and Karn, Pro
fessor Charles W. Prine, and Rob
ert M. Morgan, instructor in psy
chology.
The committee decided to sub
mit the tests in its possession to 
a detailed analysis to determine 
the validity of the questions used 
and to find what, if any, correla
tions exist.
Whatever information is so 
gained will be put to use in im
proving those questions which do 
not give decisive results and in 
determining a relationship be
tween various phases of teaching 
technique.
The program as envisioned now 
will be that of a student service
New Tartan 
Promotions 
Announced
At the March 2 meeting of the 
Tartan editorial board, Paul Offermann, printing freshman and in
dependent, was promoted to the 
position of chief sports reporter.
Virginia Steinbach, secretarial 
junior and member of Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, was named as 
staff secretary, and Helen Brody, 
general studies junior and also a 
member of Kappa Kappa Gamma 
was appointed as typist.
Burton Epstein, William Johns, 
and Joe Weinreich were promoted 
from cub reporter to reporter, and 
Nancy Will joined the staff as a 
cub reporter.
which each faculty member will 
be encouraged to utilize and which 
will enable him to judge his own 
effectiveness.
No faculty or administration 
group will be connected with this 
program, and no instructor will be 
obligated to accept the service, 
although it is anticipated that he 
will be given help in grading his 
tests if he wishes.
None of the results of the tests 
shall ever be made public. Each instructor will be the custodian 
of his own test papers, to make 
use of or ignore them as he sees 
fit.
Further experimentation will be 
carried on during the Spring se
mester so that a finished test will 
be ready next Fall.
Doherty Holds Little Hope 
For Lowered Skibo Prices
^But President Plans To Attempt 
Another Food Price Investigation
Indicating Saturday that a fresh checkup would be made on 
Skibo prices on the basis of complaints culminating in Student 
Councils Bell-Johnson report, President Robert E. Doherty held 
out little hope for the success of such an investigation.
This has been done several times before, and it will be done 
again this time, he said. Two or three years ago the faculty 
made a similar study. I myself looked into the situation. At that

And Costuming 
Are Underway
With the whir of sewing ma
chines and the clank of hammers 
in their ears, the Scotch and Soda 
club members have started cos
tuming and set construction for 
The Ladys at Work.
The costumes this year feature 
the ultra-new look as designed by 
Alfred Lehman, junior drama stu
dent. Lehman has created some
thing different for the fashion 
world. Not content with the new 
look in city wear, he has expand
ed the idea to present the new 
look on the farm. Lehmans de
signs will be executed by Arlene 
Dumond, a sophomore also from 
the drama department.
The sets under construction 
have been designed by James 
Trittipo. Scotch and Soda clubs 
executive board chose Trittipos 
sets for their freshness and origi
nality in spite of his being a fresh
man and unfamiliar with the 
unique problem of the Carnegie 
Music hall where The Ladys at 
Work will be given.

Carnival Court 
Election Will 
Be April 1
A court of seven girls will be 
chosen by a school-wide ballot on 
April 1 to Compete for the honor 
of being crbwned Queen of the 
Spring Carnival. Popularity, ac
tivity participation, beauty, and 
scholarship will be the basis of 
the individual voters choice of 
this court.
The final selection of the Queen 
will be determined by a board of 
five judges, who, like the indi
vidual voters, will consider the 
beauty, poise, and queenly attri
butes of the girl they choose to 
reign at the Carnival.
Any senior girl at Carnegie 
Tech is eligible to compete for the 
crown if she is sponsored by an 
active sorority or a girls dormi
tory. In the absence of such spon
sorship, a petition with twentyfive signatures of students will be 
sufficient to have a name placed 
upon the ballot.
Names of candidates must be 
submitted before March 13 to Dale

time, the same complaint had 
arisenprices in Skibo were high
er than those in Pittsburgh restaurants.
He questioned the sources of in
formation responsible for reports 
that Skibo is making up the losses 
incurred by other dining units on 
campus, and pointed to the exam
ple of the proposed dining room 
addition to the future Morewood 
Gardens dormitory, the price of 
which subsequently rose out of 
sight, in reply to suggested im
provements in Skibo facilities.
The President called the mak
ing of comparisons between Ski
bo and commercial restaurants a very difficult thing.
The quality of food in Ski
bo, he said, is top-notch, and 
the tonnage of food that goes on the plate is greater.
What is the box score when 
these factors are considered? It 
is my opinion that, if this is done, 
the price differential would not 
be significant. We are doing the 
best we can do. If we cut down 
the prices, the quantity must also be decreased.
To the student assertion that a 
portion of the supposedly high 
Skibo prices are the result of sup
port which Skibo is giving to al
leged losses in the operation of 
Mellon hall, other dormitory din
ing rooms, and the Inn, Dr. Doherty replied:
How do they know that it is so? I dont know that.
A suggestion that revision and 
improvement of storage and kitch
en facilities might help to lower 
prices recalled to the presidents 
mind the story of the Morewood Gardens dining hall.
And if we put money in Ski
bo, we wont have it to put in 
other places, such as the increas
ing of teaching facilities. We are 
doing the best we can to improve 
the situation; if we could find 
some practical way to do that, we would do it.
Pointing out that the whole 
place was changed several years 
ago to handle the large number 
of students, Dr. Doherty stated 
that the distribution of space 
was studied carefully by our arch
itects, and the best arrangement was used.
I dont feel that any changes 
should be necessary because the 
problems are the same today.
In describing the administra
tion of the campus eating facili
ties, the president explained that 
Mr. Miller is in charge of all of 
them. Miss White has had full 
control of the restaurantsso fai 
as I know. She reports to Mr. Miller.
We dont operate the restaurants for profit. These places may 
run in the black one semester and 
then in the red. We try to keep 
the integrated score zero. If 
individuals ran the same type of 
restaurants, they would have to charge higher prices.

EACH
IM Board Continues Fight 
For Player Health Protection
By William Schnitten
Carnegie Techs intramural 
athletic program, under the lead
er ship of Mr. See and the Intra
mural board, made a great deal 
of progress during the past se
mester toward supplying an in
teresting, comprehensive, and 
well coordinated collection of activities.
At present this program serves 
the interests of more people than 
any other extra-curricular activ
ity and perhaps has more partici
pants than all other school-spon
sored organizations combined. Administration Refuses $200
Last week the representatives 
of the college administration re
fused to extend the board a paltry 
$200 which was to serve as pari 
of an insurance fund for athletes 
injured in intramural competition. 
The story behind the boards ef
forts has enough twists and angles 
to confuse even the best Philadel
phia lawyer.
After three athletes had been 
injured last semester during com
petition and had accumulated 
debts of approximately $25 each 
for X-rays and treatments of dis
located and broken bones, the IM 
board decided to act.
To provide some sort of protec
tion against future mishaps, a 
committee was organized to in
vestigate the possibility of a group 
insurance policy. They found such 
a plan to be impossible since the 
minimum cost for protection would 
be approximately $10 per man. 
Self-Insurance Tried
Later a temporary self-insur
ance plan was inaugurated where
by each group participating in 
sports was assessed 50 cents per 
man or $7.50 per group. Sixteen 
organizations agreed to pay what 
amounted to a working capital of 
$120. Under this plan any insur
ed player would be reimbursed 
to cover the first $20 spent for 
treatment of injuries sustained in 
IM competition.
The board felt that an athlete 
should not be held wholly re
sponsible for injuries sustained 
while representing his indepen
dent or fraternity organization in 
an intramural program which is 
strongly supported by the schools 
administration. The board there
fore decided to enlist the financial 
as well as the moral support of 
the school.
Plan Turned Down f
After traveling through the 
chain of command, the boards 
representatives were referred to 
the student health committee, of 
which both Dr. Miner and Mr. 
Patton are members. These gen
tlemen agreed that some help 
should be given but didnt know 
just how this should be accom
plished.
A proposal was made whereby 
the school would set up an annual 
sinking fund of $200 for the pur
pose of paying the medical fees for 
injured men. This allotment of 
money was to be controlled and 
distributed at the discretion of the 
Intramural board.
Mr. Patton, guardian of the 
schools finances, rightfully sug
gested that the legal aspects be 
checked to determine whether the 
school, if it granted the $200, 
would be liable for any larger 
amounts. After a short wait of 
2% months the board was in
formed that the lawyers advice 
was to steer clear of handing out 
money. No mention was made, 
however, of the schools liability. New Plan Proposed
Now a new plan is in the hands 
of the student health committee. 
Upon learning that this committee 
is the receiver and controller of 
a $4400 fund, of which only $600 
was used the first semester, the 
board asked that a $200 yearly 
allotment be granted to the In
tramural board from the student 
health fund.
This appropriation would ap
pear as an increase in the an
nual intramural budget and would 
not be earmarked specifically for 
payment of injury expenses. This 
plan is to protect the school, but 
a final decision has yet to be 
reached.

couraged by the proceedings, the 
IM board still hopes to have some 
plan approved. The sentiments of 
the board are aptly expressed by 
President Otto Abraham who 
states that the IM board still 
believes that some plan of partial 
protection for participating ath
letes can be worked out, and the 
board is determined to do all that 
it can to provide that protection 
at a minimum expense to the athlete.
Players Deserve Support
Because the athletic policy of 
Carnegie Tech has discouraged 
the production of top flight inter
collegiate teams, the intramural 
program has taken the center of 
the athletic stage. As many, if not 
more, CIT students watched the 
intramural touch football games 
on the Cut over the course of last 
semester as made the trek 
through Schenley park to watch 
the varsity gridders. Yet these 
men were compelled to play on fields spotted with steel sewer 
lids, wrater holes, and ruts six 
inches deep. These hazards caus
ed the injuries mentioned.
My sentiments lie wholeheart
edly with the intramural board. 
So must the sentiments of the participating players who volun
tarily dug into their own pockets 
to help protect themselves. Per
haps the plan presented by the 
board has flaws, but it should be 
adopted pending developments of a better plan.
Some system can and must be 
evolved to protect the participants 
in the schools largest extra
curricular activity from the high 
costs of injuries.

TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1048THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Tartan Scoring Spree 
Swamps Grove City
With a sensational second half rally, the Carnegie Tech hard
wood passers posted a brilliant 63-56 win over Grove City on the 
Grovers court last Wednesday night.
Paced by Mike Theodore and Bob McCullugh, the Tartans daz
zled the SRO crowd with a fourth period scoring splurge to climax 
an uphill battle. Theodore and McCullugh netted 20 of the 24 points 
the Plaid collected in the last ten minutes.
Carnegie seemed headed for*-----------------------------------------------
another beating like the one Al
legheny handed them on their 
last outing. The Grovers, led by Captain Bish who netted 21 points 
for the night, waltzed off to a 31- 
21 lead.
Skibos Whittle Deficit
Both teams started the second 
half fast, scoring on nine of ten 
shots in two minutes. The Skibos 
then began to whittle down their 
twelve point deficit and at the 
end of the third quarter were only 
five points behind. Finally, with 
McCullough hitting on pop shots 
from around the foul circle and 
Theodore driving in hard from 
the left, the Tartans broke into the lead at 46-44.
Grovers Fall Apart
Grove City managed to tie the 
score up twice before McCullough 
sent Carnegie ahead to stay with 
a little more than two minutes remaining. The Grovers threw in 
the towel at this point and fell 
completely apart, desperately 
heaving the ball to all corners of the court.

Carnegie Tech bowed out of the 
basketball picture for another 
year by succumbing to Westmin

Wilmington court on Saturday 
night, March 6.
Plaid Threatens Early
Jumping off to a 13-8 lead in 
the first six minutes of the game, 
the Tartans threatened to provide 
their highly favored opponents 
with an unpleasant evening. But 
the Plaid threat soon faded, and*the Titans went ahead to stay, 
holding a 17-15 lead at the end 
of the first period.
Unable to match Westminsters 
aggressiveness, Carnegie was hard
ly in the game in the second and 
third periods. Dembinski and McLhinney, with 24 and 16 points 
respectively, spearheaded the Ti
tan attack. Mike Theodore was 
high point man for the Tartans, 
as he clinched first place in the 
Pittsburgh district individual 
scoring race with 11 points. 
Theodore Elected Captain
Following the game, the play
ers unanimously elected Theodore 
as their honorary captain for the 
past season. He had also been ap

Relay Team Collects 
Ninth Straight Win
Unable to match the all-around 
power of the Penn-Ohio cham
pions from Westminster, the Car
negie mermen were swamped by 
a score of 50-25 on Wednesday, 
March 3, at the Skibo pool. The 
Tartans were able to salvage only 
three first places as the Titans 
rolled to the finish of a near-per
fect season.
Once again Carnegies medley 
relay team proved its supremacy 
in the district by posting its ninth 
straight win, as the trio of Molny, 
Luckey, and Sapper outdistanced 
their rivals by half a lap.Tony Zukasky and George Cash 
continued their winning ways as 
they placed first and second in 
their diving specialty, and Bill 
Ferguson churned to a win in the 
200 yard breaststroke to complete 
the home teams first places.
Westminsters Holt turned in 
the most impressive performance 
for the Titans by bettering his 
own 150 yard backstroke record 
with the time of 1:48.6 seconds as 
he completed his intercollegiate 
swimming career. His time was
1.3 seconds better than the mark 
he set in the same event at the 
Penn - Ohio championships o n 
March 6.
The Skibo 400 yard freestyle 
relay swimmers came closer to 
victory than a Carnegie foursome 
in two years, losing by less than 
a foot in the final event of the 
afternoon after matching the 
Westminster squad for sixteen

intramural program on the same 
scale as other activities. Complete 
instructions will be given to the 
soccer novices if there are enough 
to warrant such a program
The final action of the meeting 
was the appointment of Warren

seeking to obtain different alleys 
for next years matches. The com
mittee feels that the University 
lanes are inadequate to handle the 
increased number of bowlers com*

emphasis on a spirited backing of 
our athletic teams.
C. B. Groomes, Jr., M E: My 
suggestion for the improvement 
of Student Council government is 
to elect capable and responsible 
representatives to Council and 
then give Council the power that 
it represents instead of having 
it influenced by the minority. 
Thomas J. Hall, Jr., Chem: We 
can have much more effective stu
dent government if all members 
of Student Council try to become 
familiar with all of the problems 
and ideas being considered by 
Council.
Herman A. John, Jr., M A: It 
would be to everyones advantage 
if the more interested and best 
qualified persons were chosen to 
participate in student government 
qualified by experience, knowl
edge, and ability.Better Understanding Needed 
William G. Johns, Sr. Mgt: In
duce students to participate in 
and to provide for more and bet
ter social activities and get-to
gethers so that there may be bet
ter understanding and coopera
tion among the various groups on 
the campus.
William Knightly, Soph., Mgt: 
"Student government can best be 
improved by giving a bigger voice 
in student affairs to the student 
government, thus encouraging 
more and better leaders to partici
pate in governing functions. 
Raymond Kondrat, Jr., Chem E: 
Student government would be 
more effective if members realiz
ed that there should be more per
sonal contact with Council mem
bers and the student body. 
Frank Lee, Jr., Chem E: Since 
intramural athletics are given 
prominent position on campus, I 
believe that it would be well to 
investigate thoroughly the dis
position of such funds as are allot
ted to the intramural department. 
Carl Levy, Jr., Mgt: I believe 
a more effective student govern
ment would result if the various 
factions on the campus wojuld quit 
their quibbling and work together 
to revive some of that old Tech 
spirit.
J. K. OHare, Jr., Mgt: I would 
propose a plan which would bring 
the different political factions on 
campus to support men for elec
tions who were judged on the basis 
of personal merit, rather than 
political, fraternal, or social af
filiations.
Student Interests Emphasized
F. Vincent Prus, Jr., E E: I 
feel that the best way to make our 
student government more effec
tive is to keep it more closely akin 
to the major interests of the student body.
Richard Shaffer, Soph., Math: 
In my opinion the best single 
improvement which would aid 
in the formation of a more effec
tive student governing body would 
be a change in the representation 
ration.
Alan H. Stark, Sr., Chem E: I 
believe that the best single im
provement for more effective stu
dent government would be to have 
a greater number of students 
take an active part in school ac
tivities.
Lee M. Wiley, Jr., M A: A 
deeper interest in the doings of 
the Student Council by the student bodv *
Revitalize Student Government 
Dale Wright, Sr., E E: Stu
dent government at CIT needs to 
be revitalized by an acute student 
interest in all phases of campus 
government and activities.
Mabel Brittain, Jr., Arch: Cre
ate interest within the student 
body, for interest is a lacking ele
ment here at Carnegie Tech. 
William Eckles, Jr.. Arch: A
I
 sincere effort must be made to 
educate the student, body as to the 
purpose, the functions, and the 
actual powers of the representa
tive government they elect. 
Edwin Gifford, Jr., D: To re
activate all school interest in art 
school affairs, and to reactivate 
art school interest in all school 
affairs. To honestly represent the 
wishes of the student body of Fine Arts.
Support Fair Representation
Anita Nelson, Jr., Arch: Sup
port fair student representation 
with no minority groups control
ling and foster a campaign for better school spirit.
Bennard Perlman, Jr., P&D: 
To make the student government 
truly representative by seeing 
that all campus activities are 
spoken for on Council. 
Anthony Zukasky, Jr., M: 
Council members ought to be in 
personal contact with members of 
the student body and keep, them 
personally informed as to what 
Council is doing.
Marilyn Allshouse, Jr., C&T: 
Promote better campus spirit 
and bring about closer cooperation 
between students and administra
tion and various groups of stu
dents on all major issues.
Less Quibbling* Called For 
Myra Jane Barry, Jr., Gen: 
The thing that would improve 
student government the most is less quibbling among the Coun
cil members over minor issues. 
Alberta Cuneo, Jr., Sec: En
courage greater interest in student activities, not only socially but politically.
Ethel Friedman, Jr., SW: I 
would encourage greater strength
ening of the functions of the Stu
dent Conference committee, and a 
better representation of the ad
ministration, particularly the 
Dean of Men and Dean of Women 
at the Student Conference committee meetings.
Marie Delli Gatti, Jr., C&T: As 
a member of council I would at
tempt to further activities and so
cial events for all students, and 
to better student-faculty relationships.
Dorothy L. Kane, Sec. Jr., an
nounced this afternoon that she 
planned to withdraw her candidacy.

Return To 
CIT Campus
On Tuesday evening, February 
24, Sigma Delta Phi, evening 
school fraternity, celebrated its 
tenth anniversary by reactivating 
the group. Six new members were 
initiated and new officers were 
installed. Those elected were: 
Louis Adams, President; James 
Flaherty, Vice - President; Ray 
Schwalm, Secretary; George Bo
govich, Treasurer; Frank Mihelich, Chairman of Membership 
Committee; Anthony Miscimarra, 
Social Chairman. Sigma Delt 
plans to resume many of its pre
war activities and hopes to in
crease its membership in the near 
future.
Phi Gamma Pi rushing season 
is on. For the next two weeks 
pledges will be entertained by the 
members. Big sisters were as
signed to various pledges at the 
monthly meeting on February 22. 
The rushing season ends March 7 
with a party for the rushees. Dean 
Yon and Miss Josephine Camp
bell, Assistant Dean of Women 
have been invited to attend the 
party.

company which might be inter
ested in employing them.
Smarter men cut classes and 
just sit around in the Bureau 
office, waiting for an interview 
list to begin its quarter or half 
hour of active life. And the real operators have devised even better means, a discussion of which 
is not particularly germane to the 
major issue.
This situation can be remedied 
in part by supplying what the 
Bureau as indicated is one of its greatest lacks  space for inter
views with all of the companies 
which might be induced to visit 
C. I. T. This commodity can be 
found in the publications offices 
in the Union, which are numer
ous, equipped with desks, lights, 
and telephones, and largely empty 
during the daytime. A single mes
senger boy could carry the pa
perwork between the Union and 
the Bureau office.
Several of the houses in frater
nity row might also be able to 
supply one or two rooms for the 
same purpose.
But extra space alone will not 
solve the problem completely. 
More secretarial assistance is 
needed, not only to handle this 
proposed increase in load, but to 
meet even the present demands 
on this much overworked of
fice.
These temporary personnel ad
ditions will undoubtedly be ex
pensive, but we believe that the 
class of 1948 and succeeding class
es of similar proportions deserve 
this consideration.
Interrupted educations, over
crowded classrooms and labora
tories, and the experiences which 
were responsible for these condi
tions are surely ample justifica
tion for a chance to pick and 
choose at the most critical junc
ture in lives which may yet be 
overturned once again.
We just recently heard from 
Betty Belsley (Miss Ashcraft), our 
ex-editor of last year, and she 
wishes to pass a cheery hello to 
everyone.
Some very prominent members 
of the abnormal psychology class 
attended a lecture and demonstra 
tion at the Stephen Foster Me
morial on socio-drama. Part of 
the conference on Current Trends 
in Social Psychology wonders 
just who is normal and abnor 
mal.
Simms seems to be having his 
usual troubles again. His only re
ply, If you cant convince them, 
confuse them! And most of the 
time its the truth.
The Plaid staff extends its sym 
pathies to Margaret Froelich on 
the death of her father.
Its a shame a fellow cant tell 
a fish story without having to pro 
duce evidence to verify his catch, 
but Ray Schwalm has the problem 
completely solved, for he carries 
a blown-up picture showing a 
big whopper (of course, bass) he 
caught last summer at Tionesta.
Does A1 Ruprecht have his def
initions of convex and concave 
mirrors straightened out as yet? 
The last we heard he still thought 
that a concave mirror had a hole in it and that convex ones were 
built around a hole.
Dorothy M. Briggs was ques
tioning the whereabouts of Am

class. She didnt have to refer to 
me as his half-wit.
Did you know that some parts 
of Texas are very lonesome? Jim 
Flaherty remembers one place 
where you can talk to yourself 
but it is smarter after awhile to 
talk to the lizards. If you stay 
around long enough, the lizards 
will talk and you will listen.
Engineers 
Enjoy Study 
Of Geometry
Each Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday evening a hardy band of 
students trudge into the depths 
of lower Industries Hall to analy
tic geometry class. On the few 
evenings when everyone is pres
ent, fifteen eager faces look to 
new problems to conquer. There 
are fourteen men and one girl in 
the class, the majority of whom 
are mechanical engineers.
The subject is interesting and 
is made doubly enjoyable by the 
excellent instructor, Mr. Robert 
Smith. One of the few really good 
teachers in evening school, Mr. 
Smith is a professional educator. 
He earned his B. S. at the Uni 
versity of Iowa in 1934 and his 
M. S. at the University of Pitts
burgh. Now beginning his four
teenth year in the field, Mr. Smith 
spends his days guiding aspir 
ing business men at Duquesne 
University through the perils of 
higher mathematics. His intense 
interest in his subjects frequently 
leads to overtime in class, but his 
students do not begrudge this time 
for they feel the importance of 
the material which they are being 
offered.
