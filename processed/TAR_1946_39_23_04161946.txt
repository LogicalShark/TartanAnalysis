CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.
Twenty-three Representatives 
Elected to Student Council
Management Dept. 
To Install Chapter 
i)f Natl Society
Students and faculty of, the 
Management Engineering Dept, 
|are planning to organize a student 
j branch f the Society for Ad'vancement of Management at 
IS Carnegie Tech.
| With the growth of the ManI agement Engineering Dept, the 
need was foreseen for some type 
Disorganization which could fur
nish the Management engineers 
current information about indus
trial trends, and allow them to 
meet and hear professional and 
industrial' leaders in this field. 
T is hoped that within" the near 
future closer acquaintanceship 
among all students interested in 
management will be promoted.
The Society for the Advance
ment of Management. is the rec
ognized national professional so
ciety of management people. It 
has long pioneered in the art and 
science of management, and in 
i'^iir application to ever-widenk ng fields. The local chapters, 
hrough round-table discussions, 
rovide frequent opportunities for 
embers to exchange ideas and 
experiences, and to enjoy coninuous contact with the latest deelopments in their fields.
The purposes of the Society are, 
hrough research, discussion, pubication and other appropriate 
eans: to forward the elimination 
f waste and the development of 
fficiency through the study and 
pplication of scientific princileg. and methods of management;
o bring about a better under
standing of the mutual interests 
3f government, management, in
vestors,, labor and the public in 
mproyed management; to provide!
neans whereby executives, enineers, teachers, and others con.erned who apply scientific meth
ods to management may promote 
this common interest; and to in
spire in labor, manager and em
ployer a constant adherence to 
the highest ethical conception of 
|indiyidiual and collective social re
sponsibility.
R The first meeting to discuss the 
jbroject will be held Tuesday, 
JApril J6 at 1130 A. M. in Room 
I04 I. H. Two prominent members 
|f the Pittsburgh Chapter, Mr. J. 
L. Thompson and Mr. J. D. Halprook, will be present to pass 
along information concering the 
activities of the Society, and they 
will also aid in the organization 
of a student group at Carnegie

Name of Queen 
To Be Revealed 
At Carnival Time
Saturday, April 13, the Cam
pus Queen at Spring Carnival was 
chosen from the seven members 
of the Court of the Campus 
Queen, elected on March 29. 
These girls were: Jean Garland, 
Margaret Harris, Helen Jaffurs, 
Camilla McCullough, Ann Stansbury, Shirley Swaney, and Pat 
Werner. Rather than have the 
candidates appear on a stage be
fore the judges in an impersonal 
manner, they met the judges at 
a luncheon that was attended by 
the Coronation Committee and 
was served at the Hotel Schenley at noon Saturday. The selec
tion was made by capable judges 
who were Miss Reamer, head of 
the fashion department at Kauf
mans; Mrsi. Jones in charge of the 
Powers school, at Gimbels; Mrs. 
Stuart, head of the fashion de
partment at Joseph Horne; Dr. 
Willis of the Social Relations De
partment; and Mr. Shear of the 
Architecture Department. In mak
ing their selection after the lunch
eon the judges considered person
ality, popularity, and scholarship 
in addition to beauty.
Arts Ball And Tecvet Easter Party 
Give Carnegie Campus Gala Weekend
Techites Give
Fashion Show
Last Friday and Saturday, at 
Kaufmans thirty-seven Margaret 
Morrison students displayed their 
talent by putting on a fashion re
view with the snap and precision 
of professional mannequins. Each 
girl wore a costume she had made.
For instance, there was the yel
low wool jersey, modeled by Jane 
Culp, with the definitely profes
sional touch. Melon sleeves and 
beautifully rounded shoulders ex
pressed new style trends for 
spring. Technique in sewing was 
evident in cartridge pleats that 
gave below-the-hip interest.
One of the clever frocks shown 
for travel and vacation had been 
made by Betty Lou Swanson. A 
gay printed rayon jersey with full 
gathered skirt was set on a torsohugging bodice. The seasons de
mand for small waists was drama
tized through a narrow green 
leather belt. Matching gloves of 
the printed fabric completed the 
costume.
Velma Latterman, in a waffle 
pique printed bathing suit, had 
made her summer seashore model 
at a cost of about three dollars. 
And at the same expenditure, 
Nancy Smith created an original 
design for sun funa two-piece 
striped cotton frock with bare 
mid-riff.
Then there v:as the navy sheer 
wool suit, smooth-shouldered, with 
pert fantail peplum on the jacket 
worn by Mary Lou Lerch. A navy 
and white printed blouse matched 
the jacket lining. The suit looked 
as if it had come straight from the 
workroom of a top-flight designer. 
Yet it cost but sixteen dollars, and 
Mary Lou made it all herself.
Outstanding evening dresses in
cluded a white eyelet cotton dress, 
trimmed with bands of white 
handkerchief linen, made by Tony 
Schlernitzaur. The skirt w&s ex
tremely full and set on a snug 
bodice. Bands of the linen ap
peared at the neck, on the short 
sleeves and high on the skirt! 
Bright summer flowers at the waist 
were the incentive for equal rib
bon streamers that nearly reached 
the floor.
Joanne Hipp got quite a bit of 
applause as she came sauntering 
out in her bright green pedal 
pushers. Walking in the country 
would be a perfect use for these.
A draped hipline, plus back 
skirt interest, was shown on a 
pink and gray-checked gingham 
modeled by Joanne Hawley.
Fabrics had been co-ordinated 
with designs, and a versatile selec
tion appeared in clothes for

Carnival Grows From Alum Reunion
With the resumption of the gala 
Spring Carnival and Campus Week 
at Carnegie Tech, many students 
will want to know the background 
and origin of this festival. Campus 
Week came into being in the 
pring of 1920 when the school 
ecided to hold a big alumni renion. The plans for the affair 
ere so pretentious that it, was 
ecessary to enlist the aid of the 
^Udehts, who entered into the 
Vit of the occasion so .'well that 
^subsequent Campus Weeks bearae more, of a student than an 
lumrii affair; 
The first Campus Week was 
uite different than the later ones, 
tressing mostly alumni and school 
unctions. The festivities lasted 
j|or three daysThursday, May 13, 
rough Saturday, the 15th. The 
itial everrt was a (general Assem
bly held Thursday afternoon in the 
Carnegie Music Hall, and was fol
lowed by the Tap Day exercises 
which took place on the Athletic 
Field. In the evening, Open House 
was held for the returning alumni. 
The schedule for Friday included 
interclass contests and stunts in 
the morning, a faculty-senior 
baseball game, one with Tech vs. 
Geneva in the afternoon, and a 
ROTC parade to Flagstaff Hill in 
the evening. This was followed 
by a lawn fete, band concert, a 
play in the open air theater, and a 
big dance from 9 to 1. On Satur
day morning the alumni-varsity 
baseball game and the inter
scholastic and Geneva track meets 
were held. Saturday afternoon 
witnessed gay fun-making in the 
form of a circus which featured 
clowns, side shows, Beano, the
snake eater, a greased pig, races, 
and the usual assortment of hilar
ity and nonsense. The carnival 
closed Saturday evening with an
other band concert, a smoker, and 
the alumni banquets.
Buggy Races 
This Campus Week also saw the 
innovation of the Sweepstake 
races. All vehicles which were 
entered were required to have four 
wheels, and a two man team could 
alternate in pushing and driving. 
In addition to this it was required 
that the two rear wheels be inter
changeable and that during the 
race each buggy should stop in the 
pit and exchange the rear wheels.
Coronation 
The following year a vaudeville 
show replaced the General Assem
bly, and the circus was changed to 
Saturday night. In 1922 the
Surrealistic Caterpillar 
Awarded Costume Prize 
At 46 Beaux Arts Ball
Carnegie Techs students of the 
College of Fine Arts out Mardied 
the Mardi Gras at the Beaux Arts 
Ball last Friday night, April 12. 
The Ball was held in the first floor 
of Fine Arts to the music of Maur
ice Spitalny and his orchestra. The 
first floor was decorated lavishly 
with murals and dimensional spots 
painted and designed by the stu
dents of the Painting and Design 
Department. Four murals depicting

Win Corsage Prizes at 
Tecvet Easter Party
With music furnished by Bill 
Leroy and his orchestra and an 
unusual corsage contest at inter
mission time, the Tecvet Easter 
Party, held in the Mens Gym on 
Saturday night, April 13, proved 
to be one of the seasons truly suc
cessful social functions. As a fit
ting opening for the Easter Sea
son, the dance, traditionally dec
orated in a purple and yellow 
theme, was enjoyed by a large 
crowd.
The dance was an all-school 
affair sponsored by the Tecvets, 
and the proceeds from the dance 
are to go towards the purchase or 
building of a proper memorial to 
the boys from Tech who were 
killed in the service of their coun
try. There are 113 boys who left 
Tech, either as graduates or while 
still students, who will never re
turn, and it was for a memorial 
to these boys that the evening was 
dedicated.
During intermission the judging 
of the corsages was held with Dave 
Berry acting as the Master of 
Ceremonies. The corsages, which 
were made by the escort of any
thing but flowers and worn by the 
girls, were ably judged by five of 
the chaperones  Dr. and Mrs. 
Warden, Dr. and Mrs. Gustafson, 
and Col. Dowling. There were so 
many unusual ideas carried out 
by the ingenious students that the 
judges called a tie and awarded 
duplicate prizes of one ticket to 
Spring Carnival to each of the 
two couples. The winning corsages 
were: A Walkie Talkie, put to
gether by Walter J. Smith and 
worn by Florence Ann Bucher; 
and Lost Weekend, made by 
Dave Berry and worn by Joan 
Perl. The varied conceptions of 
the novel in corsages included al
most everything from electric 
lights and crepe paper to the one 
entitled Oversexed Easter Egg, 
devised by Ernie Snoyer and borne 
by Jackie Alexander, on which 
there was a live baby chick in a 
half egg shell.
Drama Department put on a play 
in lieu of the circus. This year 
was the beginning of the Campus 
Queen festivities, for the students 
elected the schools most popular 
beauty and crowned her the Queen 
at the Mardi Gras festivities. The 
play produced by the Drama De
partment was replaced in 1925 by 
a musical revue presented by the 
entire school. Two years later, 
the crowning of a Queen was 
made much more pretentious by 
holding a Coronation ceremony at 
LConiinited on p. 3]
Easter Parade Fun
four ages of women decorated the 
foyer of the building outside of 
the Exhibition Room. The four 
ages were: Age of Innocence, Age 
of Consent, Age of Remorse, and 
Age. All of the murals were sur
realistic since the theme of the 
ball was surrealism.
Prizes were awarded for the 
best costume. The judges were 
Dean Yon, Dean Warden, Director 
Johnstone, Maurice Spitalny and 
Jessie the janitor. First prize was 
awarded to the Junior Illustrators 
of the P. & D. dept, for their rep
resentation of a surrealistic cater
pillar. Leading the caterpillar on 
a leash was Mr. Readio, head of 
the department. Head bug wras 
Mary Lou Snedden; the other bugs 
were Boo Girts, Martha Morrill, 
Mona Leah Kahn, Lenny Smith; 
bringing up the rear was the only 
man, a freshman veteran, Paul 
Barmettle. The prize was a cer
amic head made by Virgil Cantini.
Second prize went to Irene 
Waichler and Margie Schroeder 
for representing a split personality 
or double life or whatever. Third 
prize was won by Mr. and Mrs. C. 
Kermit Ewing lor their black-andgold costumes.
Refreshments consisting of fruit 
punch and cake were served midst 
more surrealistic decorations in 
the Exhibition Room. A mural de
picting two huge heads covered 
the whole left wall of the room. 
Outside on the steps sat a lady 
taking a bath midst egg shells 
painted like eyeballs. Some of the 
statues standing in the foyer 
sprouted new additions such as 
horses heads. A somewhat inebri
ated horse sat on a bench eating 
hay, or was it oats. The lighting 
was very effective. The predom
inating color was red. In a niche 
was an eyeball being roastedfor 
whom it was not disclosed.
Skits were planned to be pre
sented after the judgment but 
were called off. For entertainment 
Bob Smith sang Top Floor Blues 
and Fan Man Blues, and Corinne 
de Chiccis sang.

Editors Armchair
A Semisatisfactory Solution
It seems that we always start our editorials by saying that 
somebody is unhappy about something. This weeks effort is 
no exception. At least one hundred Engineers are not precisely 
joyful at present, some of them because they have to and some 
because they are not permitted to attend the summer session 
at Carnegie. A large number of these men had intended to 
work this summer. For some of them the earning of a reason
able amount of money this summer is a necessity. A vacation 
would do much to rejuvenate the addled minds of others. Sev
eral students wanted very much to attend school during the 
trimester because they desire to finish their college educations 
as soon as possible. The engineers are very much confused by 
and rather bitter about the conflicting decrees of the adminis
tration in regard to the coming semester. An explanation of 
their seemingly inconsistent dicta are herewith presented:
The members of the faculty at Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology have been teaching classes constantly for four years 
without more than a weeks vacation at any one time. They 
are tired, and although they are willing to continue teaching 
in the summer as long as it is absolutely necessary, they are 
very anxious to see the termination of the tri-semester school 
year come in the near future. In order to give the professors a 
rest as soon as possible, and also to continue with the summer 
semester as long as is absolutely necessary, the administration 
has drawn up a plan which provides for the final termination 
of the tri-semester program in the year 1946. Under this plan, 
some students will go during the summer so that they may 
graduate as soon as possible, and others will be required to 
wait until fall and will then enroll in the regular fall term. 
Students who refuse to follow the program will loose their 
priorities in the registration, and may be unable to re-enroll in 
the fall. It may seem to some that this program is harsh, and 
that it is unfair to the students. Many may feel that the at
tempt to put the school back to a two-semester instructional 
basis is premature. In favor of the system we should like to 
say only that it is at least partially fair in that it considers all 
students equally in relation to the plan and that the faculty 
undoubtedly must have a rest in the not-too-distant future. The 
system will be hard on those who find it necessary to earn 
money in the summer. But for the most extreme cases the ad
ministration will probably make exceptions. It is not a perfect 
solution, but it is probably the best that can4oe expected.
To The Defense of Soc Rel
Last week in the Letters to the Editor column an ex-G.I. 
voiced a bitter condemnation of the Soc. Rel. program at Car
negie Tech. He stated in his bitter missive that he considered 
the study of history and of economics and of literature totally 
irrelevant to the education of an engineer. He made it plain 
that he considers the Social Relations Program a complete 
waste of time. We dont believe that our administration is the 
best of its kind in the country, we admit that they frequently 
have some pretty screwey ideas, but in the Soc Rel program 
we, unlike Mr. Catullo, think that the powers that be have 
hit upon a wonderful idea.
Mr. Catullo claims that his study of things that have occur
red in the worlds past are inconsequential to him as an engithat it is not essential for an engineer to know 
>ut economics. He believes that an engineer has 
;o know what makes himself and other engineers tick, 
tint for him a picture of what his ideal engineer would 
id what effect said engineer would have on the society.

April Fools Day is long since 
over, but that day of the practical 
joker is still making the process 
of reading exchange newspapers 
a problem. Notices of revolutions 
on campus or the sudden death of 
Kilroy sandwiched in with an
nouncement of a Tau Beta Pi 
meeting are disturbing to the 
searcher for truth.
In addition to April Fool prob
lems, the countrys colleges have 
a number of other difficulties in 
common. For example, many 
schools are holding their campus 
queen elections, and the cam
paigning is terrific. Theyre also 
getting ready to vote for candi
dates for Student Council or the 
equivalents thereof, and the var
ious college editors, apparently all 
independents, decry the apparent 
influence of fraternities in these 
elections, and exhort the poor in
dependent to come on out and 
vote. And the independents ignore 
the crusaders as usual, except at

A concert of the selected works

is the program chairman. The 
Friends of Harvey Gaul is an or

April, 1881, hence the concert is 
being given in the month of his 
birth.
terviewed the head of the depart
ment of chemistry, and printed the 
results, which make good sense. 
The professor questioned about 
this experiment, notes that there 
has never been a prolonged peace 
except when some one govern
ment was so powerful that it could 
not be challenged, that the AngloAmerican alliance, though a mat
ter of tacit understanding, is one 
of the facts of history, and that 
right now, there are two powers 
of approximately equal strength 
in the world, the Alliance and 
Rus&ia. Under these circum
stances, we are headed for an
other war unless a world govern
ment powerful enough to control 
the opposing factions exists. The 
U. N. O. does not fulfill these 
specifications now and at the rate 
it is retrogressing, never will. 
Hence, it might be a good idea to 
investigate the nature of a coming 
war. Operation Crossroads will 
help to do this, in addition tc 
eliminating a good number of ob
solete ships. The necessary data 
about the damage which atomic 
bombs can inflict upon warships 
under varying conditions cannot 
be predicted by calculation alone. 
Experiments must be conducted 
to answer this question, so that 
a navy of the future can be pro
perly planned. The present emo
tional hysteria over the forth
coming tests at Bikini. Atoll i6 
merely impeding measures vital 
to national security.
An economist at Temple Uni
versity is of the opinion that 
wheat necessary to feed starving 
Europe is being kept in granar
ies by farmers awaiting price ittrcreases. The economist agrees 
with this idea of temporary 
hoarding, contending that the pro
posed price rise of three cents per 
bushel is an affront to the farm
ers. If the OPA would grant a 
20 cents per bushel increase, it 
would merely compensate for the 
extra deflation which farm prices 
suffered during the last depres
sion and would assure maximum 
production and distribution of the 
needed grain. He also pointed out 
several interesting current agri
cultural trends. Many wealthy 
business and professional people 
are acquiring farms for prestige 
reasons. City workers are also 
buying farms on a smaller scale 
(from one to five acres) for leis
ure time enjoyment. The intro
duction of more and better ma
chinery on the farm has made it 
economical to operate farms five 
times as large as those of a decade 
or so ago and is also causing many 
farmers to specialize in a single 
product in a very profitable way. 
As a result of this situation and 
modern transportation and com
munication, the present day tiller 
of the land is becoming quite ur
bane.

are ham sandwiches. I dont like 
ham sandwiches.
Also, one of the girls behind 
the counter confided to me thkt 
it took eight girls three hours to 
make the sandwiches. The othfc: 
way it only took one or two girts 
the same length of time, and the 
sandwiches were much better.
I realize that to keep theyga 
fresh they must be kept in the

bananas and cheese sandwich*, 
taste better if they are not ci>ld. 
Also, though they dont get bla$k

things do happen. Lets go back 
to the old system; Im perfectly 
willing to stand in line ten min

For Knave of Hearts
Thirteen Initiated 
By Tau Beta Pi
Thirteen pledges of Tau Beta 
Pi, national engineering and sci
ence honorary, were initiated at 
the Union last Friday afternoon. 
After the ceremonies, the frater
nity adjourned to the Royal York
The guest speaker at the ban
quet was Mr. A. C. Monteith, Di
rector of Education and Manager 
of Headquarters Engineering at 
Westinghouse. His speech, New 
Uses for Electricity, was illus
trated by slides, and he followed 
the lecture with a technicolor mo
tion picture showing how the lat
est developments in electricity 
will enhance the homes of the fu
ture.
Dr. Webster N. Jones, Director 
of the College of Engineering, was 
the banqueets toastmaster. The 
first speaker introduced was Tau 
Beta Pis president, Joseph Franz, 
who awarded a handbook of 
chemistry and physics to Jerard 
Pederson for his prize-winning 
pledge essay on the subject What 
shall we do with the atomic 
bomb?
Dr. Frederic Mavis, a member 
of the fraternitys advisory board, 
discussed the part that Tau Beta 
Pi can play in organizing engi
neers into a unified society rather 
than permitting them to remain 
divided into various speeialified 
fields of engineering as they are at 
the present.
Cloyd R. Mellott, the only hon
or (first semester) junior in the 
pledge class, delivered the ac
ceptance speech on behalf of the 
recently-initiated pledges. In ad
dition to Mellott, those initiated 
were Richard Heckman, George 
Hinman, Joseph Meierdirks, Jr., 
Arthur Opinsky, Frank Pake, Jerard Pederson, Alex Sherman, Les
ter Siciliano, Robert Straka, Mil
ford Tassler, Karl Weber III, and 
Rolf Weil.
In line with its new policy of 
economizing CIT is giving its stu
dents a holiday of six days, there
by eliminating operating expenses 
for that period.
In this connection the chairman 
of the Board of Trustees told your 
reporter in strictest confidence: 
It is killing us, the eager beavers, 
I mean. We used to close up at 9 
P. M. but lately more and more 
students with that I-want-mymoneys-worth look in their eyes 
come back at night and work in 
the labs, loaf in the libraries, and 
stand in the halls morosely staring 
at their lockers. Its getting so 
that the members of the track 
team are afraid to practice in the 
halls at night for fear of bumping 
into someone. It is because of 
people like this, he said, that our 
expenses go up and we must raise 
tuition fees.
Of course, he admitted with a 
glint in his eye, we make money 
on these people too. Last week 
two boys mistakenly locked in the 
machinery lab all night, were 
frightened to death by a moving 
crane, which they thought was a 
ghost. We use the corpses in lieu 
of lab instructors now. And yes
terday, the loquacious bigwig 
continued, a girl was locked over
night in the cooking room at Mar
garet Morrison and starved to 
death. Its surprising how much 
they pay for skeletons at Pitt he 
said, patting his wallet.
So therefore, dear friends and 
gentle hearts, though your humble 
reporter is not an editor, heed his 
advice: please leave the premises 
of ye sacred halls immediately 
when the bell rings. If you are 
planning to cuddle up with a shiny 
photometer for the next six days, 
or to ride the broomstick circuit on 
the janitors mustachioed walking 
stick, forsake the idea. Go Home! 
In other words, Shoo! Scat! 
To emphasize my point I quote 
from the humor section of the Pitt 
Newa:
Who wa* that punchdrunk 
zombie I seen you with last 
night?
That was no zombie  she
Last Friday night the first floor 
of Fine Arts building looked like 
the end of a Lost Week-end in
stead of the beginning. The sight 
of the huge caterpillar wending 
or lurching its way thru the merry 
throng was enough to send one of 
weak constitution on a Lost Week
end. The people at the dance could 
use that for an excuse if they wish 
to admit that a twenty-foot cater
pillar is too much for them. The 
caterpillar was a clever concoc
tion consisting of Mr. Readio, non
chalantly leading green paint and 
six P & Ds. The P & Ds wore 
stockings over their heads with 
willow branches entwined in them 
for feelers and painted their legs 
different colors. They were a very 
caterpillary-looking group of peo
ple. The caterpillar was an edu
cated one for it went along doing 
the conga but then so are the P & 
Ds educated. Some of the people
studies at Carnegie Tech.
You work hard enough as it is, 
gentle souls. For the next six 
days go fly a kite.
If you cant afford a kite, APO 
is selling petunias in the lower 
lobby. These are guaranteed to 
have enough petals so you can say 
She loves me, she loves me not, 
eight hundred times. What a buy!
Incidentally, the chairman of the 
board asked me to announce this: 
If you want to take an extra day 
or two off, after vacation, dont 
hesitatego right ahead. Thats 
the way CIT saves money. Or, as 
he put it, An absence a day keeps 
the collector away.
Du Pont Awards CIT 
Chem. Eng. Fellowship
' A post-graduate fellowship in 
chemical engineering has been 
awarded to Carnegie Tech by the 
Du Pont Corporation. This fel
lowship is one of forty-one to be 
awarded t o various schools 
throughout the country in 1946 
by the corporation to help meet 
the serious shortage of chemists 
and engineers that is facing the 
chemical industry today.
Under the Du Pont plan both 
men and women are eligible to 
receive the fellowship, the selec
tion of which is left entirely to 
the school. The recipient has no 
restrictions placed on his future 
employment.
The fellowship provides $1200 
for a single person and $1800 for 
a married person. An award of 
$1000 is given to the school to 
finance tuition and fees. Any sur
plus is turned over to the depart
ment administering the fellow
ship for whatever purposes they 
deem desirable.

came as the makings of a Lost 
Weekend. One girl was a huge 
sloe gin fizz. Unfortunately the 
fizz was made of celophane. An
other one was a martini with a 
cherry* a foot in diameter.
All of this was as it should be 
for there was a walking shower 
bath there to bring around any 
unfortunates. In fact there was a 
complete perambulating bathroom. 
Didy Elliott came as a cloud, but 
there was nothing gloomy about 
her costume as any man there can 
testify. She was portraying a nice 
light cumulus cloud.
The most surrealistic costume 
was the split personality assem
bly. It was complete even to brains 
on the inside of the split heads. 
The huge head was split and each 
girl wore half. With their identical 
costumes and green faces they 
could have come from Dali. Mr. 
and Mrs. Ewing wore abstract 
black and gold costumes.
Kilroys tombstone was there 
setting right on the head of the 
corps itself. It was hard to believe 
that the old boy needed a tomb
stone for his hands left their mark 
on many garls leotards in very 
strategic positions. There was an 
old mans head. His nose was 
painted on a girls bare midriff 
and his eyes right above. Four 
Roses was there in more ways 
than one for four dramats came 
as rose plantspotted ones at 
that. Slim, the old card, came 
dressed in cards. Scotty Yuchison 
looked so cute as a satyr that the 
girls reversed the usual process 
and chased him instead. Tom Lakowski came as an artist gone bad 
or the personification of evil (as 
in Dorian Gray?) of too late. The 
costumes were really clever. They 
along with the surrealistic murals 
and other decorations lent a really 
unreal atmosphere to the old art 
school.
Mens Music Honorary 
Pledges Nine Members
Phi Mu Alpha, recently reac
tivated mens music honorary, has 
pledged ten men as a step toward 
restoring the fraternity to full 
strength on the campus. The red, 
black, and gold triangle, pledge 
emblem of Phi Mu Alpha, is now 
being worn by Bill Benswanger, 
Burton Dines, Joe Dove, Albert 
Flower, Bob Piatt, Ted Ripper, 
Bill Strohecker, Cliff Taylor, Les
ter Trimble, and Hamilton Whitlinger. These prospective Sinfonians will be informally initiated 
on May 18, and a formal initiation 
will be held the following even

The annual Maggie Murph Skit 
Party held Thursday evening, 
April 11, in Recreation Hall prov
ed to be one hilarious evening for 
both faculty and students. The 
Sophomore Class  48  now 
proudly sports the Cup for this 
years performance, awarded by 
Judges Charles Watkins and Miss 
Christine McBride.
The Freshmen opened the pro
gram with When the Woman 
Takes Over in 2046. They dram
atized the actions of woman in 
sports, society, and the criminal 
world after 100 years of freedom 
from male domination. The whole 
Frosh program was acted out in 
costumes, one of the most original 
being a chorus of society debs 
draped in white sheets with a
Campus Week
[Continued from p. I]
the Coronation Dance which took
place Thursday evening.
In 1929 Demon Gloom reigned 
over the campus as the Adminis
tration abolished Campus Week 
since it had become too much of 
a student affair and took too much 
time from their studies. However 
all of the events were not done 
away with. The* following year 
saw a revival of the celebration, 
but on a modified scale. It as
sumed the name of Spring Carni
val and opened with the Corona
tion Dance and ceremony on 
Thursday evening. On Friday the 
Fair and Tap Day were held, and 
on Saturday a play and the Sweep
stakes were held.
During the next two years, a 
dance on Friday evening and a 
Musical Revue on Saturday were 
instituted.
In the following years, Spring 
Carnival remained a colorful af
fair and became even more festive. 
Spring Carnival and Campus Week 
lasted for three daysthree days 
of action-packed events. In 1937, 
the Carnival assumed some of its 
present form. In that year, one of 
the nations leading bands was 
obtained for the informal dance, 
the coronation was moved to Fri
day evening, and the formal dance 
was held on Saturday evening.
The beginning of the war 
marked a curtailment in the tradi
tional Carnival festivities. The 
last big Spring Carnival was held 
in the spring of 1943, just before 
most of the men in school at the 
time were called into service. The 
feature that year was a big Mardi 
Gras, with a large number of floats 
entered. However, there were no 
sweepstakes races this time.
The last Spring Carnival was 
held two years ago. A last minute 
removal of the ASTP required 
Carnival to be moved ahead to the 
end of March, and the weekend to 
last f>nly two days. The fraternity 
booths and contests preserved 
some vestige of previous Carnivals. 
But last year was a different story. 
With the school at its lowest ebb, 
very few social events were held, 
and Spring Carnival was a cas
ualty.
This year the Spring Carnival 
Committee of ODK is making 
plans to have a Spring Carnival 
as grand as possible. Since this is 
the first post-war Spring Carnival, 
all students will have to get be
hind it, join in the festivities, and 
help put it over. In that way, one 
of Carnegies best known tradi
tions will be strengthened, and 
next year will see Spring Carnival 
in all the color and glory of pre
war Campus Weeks.
clothes line bound around their 
waists. The football team had a 
game with Pitts team and al
though they didnt score any 
points they certainly had a fine 
time playing with their yo-yos.
The Sophomore skit called To
day in Skibo showed Skibo in all 
its glory with chorus girl wait
resses, a waiter, menus, entertain
ers, plus laughs and songs by the 
Sunshine Girls  Pasty Irwin 
and Pat Clarke. Two glamorous 
sophomores gave out with Embraceable You and Hong Kong 
Blues in their most exotic garb; 
Nancey Heriot in sailor togs danc
ed The Sailors Hornpipe. The 
chorus girls displayed their very 
enticing leg art in a routine to 
Thats College Rhythm for a 
willing audience.
The Juniors dug way back to 
the War Time Days for a Cig
arette Shortage skit. The audi
ences only regret was to see 12 
beautiful Juniors completely hid
den by full-length cigarette playcards.
The Seniors came out in real 
professional style with a Truth 
or Consequences Program. They 
preyed on both faculty and stu
dents. Dr. Goodfellow, who was 
able to get out Ciceros first name 
before he got the gong, received 
a four foot cardboard sucker for 
repeating an articulate tonguetwister. Jean Garland and Shir
ley Swaney did an excellent job 
of feeding each other berry pie 
while blindfolded.
The faculty really outdid them
selves this year by reenacting the 
Skibo Campaign for the Knave 
of Hearts. The hopeful candi
dates were Professor Swanson, 
Mr. X, Professor Donny Goodfellow, Professor Dawes, and a 
dark horse  Professor Staley. 
Posters littered the stage with 
such slogans as Eta Pi has the 
guyVote for Swanson. Char
leys All Girl Jive Band was real
ly in the grove with Dr. Watkins 
giving the old baton a workout 
and Dr. Van Sycle playing a hot 
clarinet while some of the other 
female members of the faculty 
beat it out. The climax of the 
evening was Oh, Frankie 
Schultz singing, Oh, What It 
Seemed To Be with Miss Ely. The 
skit ended with Professor Staley 
(who had spent his time on stage 
painting signs Vote for Me on 
the walls) being crowned with a 
rolling pin as Knave of Hearts.
Refreshments of ice cream and 
cookies concluded a wonderful 
evenings entertainment.
31 Graduate Promoted
Mr. Schildkamp, a native of 
Scottdale, Penna. and a graduate 
from Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology in 1931, has been appoint
ed supervisor of wage administra
tion for the Westinghouse Lamp 
Division, Bloomfield, N. J.
As a student in 1926, Mr. Schild
kamp joined Westinghouse at the 
East Pittsburgh, Penna. Works. 
He was transferred to the Mer
chant Marine Division in 1942 as 
personnel supervisor of the light 
shop. He held this position until 
his recent appointment.

that beauty and brains dont mix. 
As a sophomore she was selected 
to Cwens and is now a member 
of Mortar Board, senior Womens 
honorary. Other campus activities 
include Freshman Class President, 
Womens Guild (sophomore and

One of our serious special 
pleaders this week is the Univer
sity of Detroits publication The 
Varsity News. It seems as though 
one of the members of the uni
versitys faculty submitted a let
ter to the New York Times, which 
was promptly returned with a po
lite expression of the papers in
ability to make use of it. The 
school printed the letter, with a 
good bit of accompanying indig
nation, in the editorial column. 
It says in substance that Spain 
and Franco are now being sub
jected to a vicious campaign of 
hate and slander, originated by 
Communist influences. Spain, the 
writer asserts, poses no immediate 
threat to the peace of the world. 
To disturb this situation will pro
voke another civil war. Is it worth 
while? And wouldnt it throw 
Europe at the feet of the one land 
power able to exploit the situa
tion? Finally, are we not inter
fering with the sovereign rights 
of another nation by using exter
nal pressure to create an internal 
upheaval. If we do this, we will 
be repaid by distrust and disloy
alty from the smaller nations of 
the world. The people of Spain 
are in back of Franco, so what is 
the source and justification of all 
this agitation? The citizens of 
America have a right to know.
The April Fool edition of the 
Daily Texan contains a piece 
which must have given its author 
great pleasure in the writing. He 
notes happily that men have been 
seen around campus in every type 
and oddment of uniform and 
pieces of uniform, all tastefully 
combined with plaid shirts or 
fancy belts. The writers old com
manding general would have 
apoplexy if he could see this mass 
breaking of the uniform regula
tions. However, the writer can see 
noting wrong with his combinaboys and three girls.
Although she is majoring in 
dietitics at school, she makes 
many of her own clothes at home

after four years) or dancing. In

nis, but other than that, she en
joys her sports from the specta
tors seat. People and food rate 
high with herAlmost too high, 
she adds, Im always trying to 
keep on a diet, but never can. 
After Helen graduates, she plans 
to continue her education with a 
years interneship at some leading 
hospital. That is, of course, after 
taking the summer off to just 
loaf.
Helen really likes Tech  she 
cant gripe about any of the usual 
problems of college life. On the 
other hand, she does not like peo
ple who come to school and do 
nothing but find fault with every
thing about it, and then do noth
ing to help better the situation. 
That is why she is glad to see 
more school spirit on campus this 
year. Its more like our fresh
man year, she says. Other than 
the problem of gripers, she cant 
complain about a thing except 
crowded busegand they do an

The members of the flying club 
of the University of Syracuse heard 
Major General Anderson speak 
last week on the necessity for a 
large post-war air force. The gen
eral, former commander of the 
Eighth Air Force Bomber Com
mand, said that an adequate air 
force is cheap insurance in this 
atomic age. What with the devel
opment of electronics, jet pro
pulsion, and the discovery of 
atomic energy, a coordinated air 
defense is the only means of pro
tecting our homes and factories. 
A unified command would be a 
great aid in reaching these ob
jectives, but although there has 
been much talk of this, nothing 
concrete has been accomplished. 
Following the lecture, the film 
The Last Bomb which pictured 
the sequence of a mission over 
Tokyo, from the take-offs to the 
last returning planes, was shown 
as well as another covering a raid 
over Italy. The latter must have 
annoyed the general no end.
The reporters of the Technology 
News of Illinois Tech must have 
an in with the Navy, for they ob
tained an answer to the question 
which has been bothering many 
of us who have friends in that 
branch of service and who are 
anxiously awaiting their return. 
A ranking naval officer reported 
that all hands will be out in 
six to ten years. This source close 
to a source also stated that a 
special discharge button will be 
issued for all those who spent 
their time and the taxpayers 
money in V-12. It consists of a 
wreath of poison ivy encircling 
a giligalu bird. This gadget, long 
known to sailors as the bird which 
flies backward because he doesnt 
give a damn where hes going but 
wants to see where hes been, has 
been chosen for this honor be
cause of its lack of wings, a tail, 
a head, and a body. The emblem 
is soon to be issued to all person
nel and is to be worn 17 and 33/32 
inches above the back of the left 
knee-cap.
On Saturday, April 27, the 
Greeks on campus will again get 
together and compete for that 
sought-after cup in the Annual 
Greek Sing and Swing contest. As 
has been the custom for a long 
time, each fraternity and sorority 
on campus which wishes to enter 
the competition presents two or 
three selections at this sing fest; 
and the judges, usually after 
much deliberation, pick the win
ning team. The prize is the Sing 
and Swing Cup. If an organiza
tion succeeds in winning the cup 
three times they can keep it. This 
year should present an interesting 
result, as three sororities have 
won the cup twice.
Last year, the Chi Omegas were 
the lucky ones, with the Thetas 
winning honorable mention. On 
the mens side, the S. A. E.s won 
the barber-shop quartet.
Alpha Phi Omega 
Initiates Eight
The initiation of eight pledges 
into Alpha Phi Omega, national 
scouting fraternity, was the high
light of an overnight trip to the 
Hubbard Boy Scout Reservation 
near North Park, taken by the 
fraternity last Saturday and Sun
day.
A banquet preceded the initia
tion ceremonies with President 
Joel Bigelman acting as toastmas
ter. APOs faculty advisors, Dean 
Beryl Warden, Dr. Robert Gregg, 
Mr. Kent Shaffer, and Mr. Frank 
Eyman, and a scouting executive, 
Mr. Andrew Benson, attended the 
ceremonies and each spoke after 
the dinner commenting briefly on 
the aims, work, and history of the 
fraternity.
Gene Essner, spoke on behalf 
of the pledge class of which he is 
president, and then each member 
of the fraternity introduced him
self to the new members.
Filling out the schedule for the 
evening, the members of APO 
gathered around the fireplace for 
some good old-fashioned harmon
izing.
The members of the pledge 
class were Gene Essner, Warren 
Dickson, Robert Dismukes, David 
Douden, Milton Hobbs, Louis 
Knipling, Seymour Tomashoff, 
and the honorary member, Ed
ward J. Minister who is Assistant 
Chief Scout Executive of the Alle
gheny District.
Concert Planned
The Mens Glee Club and the 
Womens Glee Club will combine 
to give a concert in Exhibition 
Hall. It will be held an Wednes
day, April 24, at 8:15 and all stu
dents are cordially invited.
Tickets are free, and may be 
had by any student who wants 
them either in Miss Orrs or the 
Arts School Office. The only stip
ulation is that admission will be 
by ticket only.
There will be both sacred and 
secular music. In addition to sep
arate numbers the groups will 
sing two combined ones. There 
will also be a piano solo and a 
tenor solo. The womans trio will 
also do a number.

Mr. Lopatnikoff is recognized as 
one of the outstanding contem

honor of the new actives.
Congratulations are due Jane

Saturday, April 13. Four girls, 
Ann Daniels, Pat Murphy, Pat Falkenhain, Mrs. Gilliland, a Beetle 
alumna, are now the proud bear

were the guests of the other mem
bers for dinner at the Sohenley 
Coffee Shop. Each initiate was 
given a corsage of yellow daffodils.
The Pitt chapter of the TriDelts entertained the Tech chap

Arts Elevator 
Provideth Thrills
Fine Arts alumnae, graduating 
students, and even freshmen leave 
Tech with at least one memory, 
that of the elevators. For those un
fortunates who hail from Maggie 
Murph or Engineering, a descrip
tion of said elevator should be in
cluded. It lies crouched waiting 
at the bottom of the south end of 
Fine Arts (crouched and waiting 
at the bottom only if you are at 
the top and vice versa). As is cus
tomary with elevators, it is square 
except for the three sides which 
are slightly convex-bulging, that 
is. There are glass outer doors 
all of which are cracked by some 
overanxious student or perhaps 
near-sighted architect who had 
forgotten his glasses in the 8:30 
rush or even by a bitter P. & D. 
who had just missed the last trip. 
On the left are the push buttons 
which, if you are lucky and remember to press them, will set 
the mechanism in operation and 
eventually cause the elevator to 
rise or fall depending on where 
you wish to go. Along these black 
buttons is a red one which will 
stop the elevator in case of emercies (and emergencies are cease
less.) A sign inside the elevator 
claims that it has passed inspec
tion and generally there are other 
doodlings by stranded occupants 
who had become slightly stircrazy. Such doodlings include bit
ter comments like Good to the 
last drop; Stranded May 26, 
1938; Gus loves Susy. Names 
are scribbled and scratched into 
the walls which provide fascinat
ing and historical reading material 
in case you wish to sepnd your 
spare time in said **lift.
An essential requisite for all 
riders is a key, costing one dollar, 
to be refunded when after gradu
ating you return the key. Such 
cases of refunded dollars are few 
and thus the administration makes

man everyone has his key and 
rides at will but the senior, a poor 
keyless and dollarless creature, 
staggers in at 8:45, at which time 
all freshmen are in class, and 
waits, leaning dejectedly against 
the door, he waits for the neces
sary keybearer. It is lonely and 
late and the elevator is on the 
fourth floor and no-one else ar
rives except other seniors, who, of 
course, are in the same condition. 
Finally at 9:30 (no-one would 
walk those 6,000 marble steps for 
a class), he is rescued. Crowded 
into the comer by 20 knowledgeseeking students, he rides jerkily 
to his destination, minus 2 feet, 
sprains his shoulder forcing open 
the door, and trips out to his 8:30 
class.

Anne puts in her eight hours 
right here on campus, acting as 
Secretary to the Professor of Mil. itary Science and Tactics. She 
v graduated from Schenley High 
School, and attended evening 
school at Pitt for a short time bes fore Tech beckoned with ap
pealing courses in Psychology, 
and Individual Clothing Problems. 
This is Annes second semester 
here at Tech and she really adores 
 her studies. (This is on the level).

The schedule of the subjects of

a summer session, but a Supple

established several years ago with 
a three-fold purpos; First, to en
able evening students to make up 
the work of a term or year in one 
subject; second, to lighten. sched
ules during the regular evening 
school year; third, to enable stu

for this term, and the term comes 
after the close of the regular year.

Deflections
Since our writer of Reflec 
tions had other committments to
night, yours truly was appointed 
to write a Deflection article, or 
what most people would call a 
gripe column.
Gripe No. 1. Why the heck does 
a fellow have to eat alone in the 
Skibo when surely there are quite 
a few other Evening students who 
also eat there at the same time.
No. 2. Why so few evening stu
dents take an interest in extra
curricular activities. Surely the 
students havent forgotten the old 
adage, All work and no play 
makes an evening student a dull
ard.
No. 3. Why so many of the re
turning Vets, who because they 
have had a few quickies in En
gineering subjects, now try to tell 
the profs how it should be done - 
and thus take up the time allowed 
for those of us who are not so 
bright.
No. 4. Why day students give 
the evening student a daintly up
turned nose when they see them, 
or maybe they dont see them.
No. 5. Why there are so many 
nickels for Perry Comos recording 
of Im a Prisoner of Love, itnd 
yet so few for Dick Haymes 
Moon Mist.
No. 6. Why a person coming to 
class Friday evening is unable to 
obtain a copy of the PLAID.
No. 7. Why someone doesnt 
cover the couch in the study room 
No. 130 with a nice slipcover. It 
would make the room cheerful.
No. 8. Why we dont have nice, 
warm weather. Its spring, isnt 
it?
No. 9. Why we have to parade 
this Easter in our suit bought for 
Easter five years ago.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 16, 1946
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
A basketball game which wont be entered in Techs record 
books, but which, nevertheless is worthy of mention came off 
in the gym Thursday night. The Dorm Combine and D.U. 
teams tangled for a keg of beer. The two teams were captained 
by that rare pair Zeke Brill and Bob Hannover, both former 
Tech basketball luminaries. Weel the D.U.s now owe the Dorm 
gang some beer, as they wound up on the short end of a 20-17

count. The quarter scores provide 
something interesting. At the end 
of the first, the Combine led 8-6. 
At the half, the D. U.s led 10-8, 
(the Combine not scoring in the 
second quarter). The D. U7s went 
scoreless in the third stanza and 
the Combine took a 17-10 lead to 
coast into the win by 20-17. Aside 
from the team rivalry, there .was 
also a bet on between the two cap
tains about which could score the 
most. Maxie Hannums former pu
pils rested on their laurels too 
much, I guess for Hannover won 
the contest by scoring a free throw 
in the last quarter while Zeke 
was knocking himself out to gather 
one less. Final tally:

Sporty Wiernacz is at it again. 
It seems that when the Crusher 
finds a joke thats down to his 
mentality, he cant resist telling 
it to everyone he meets. Heres a 
tip to those who encounter the 
Sharp One on campus: When he 
comes up and says, What two 
things cant you have for break
fast? the answer is, Dinner and 
Supper! Incidentally, Ed wants 
it known that he is not the worst 
badminton player in the universe, 
In fact, says he, the man who 
won the tournament is the man 
who crushed the man who crushed 
the Crusher.
Beamer Breaks Four Min. Mile
After the track meet  Saturday, 
Bill Beamer showed the boys the 
wonder of the century,a thing 
which nobody has ever before 
done,a thing which will dis
tinguish Bill for the rest of his 
lifethe four-minute mile. There 
was only one thing which made it 
a little less spectacular,he used 
a moto-scoot.
Suggestion to the intramural 
board; Toss out that rule about 
corner kicks on a tie soccer game. 
If a game is tied, give each team 
one point. Comer kicks are a very 
poor indication of which team has 
been on the offiensive more of the 
time with the field as short as it 
is. The object of the game is to 
put the ball through the goal. If 
one team does it as much as the 
other, neither wins.
The Eating of Words! 
The Cast track coach, Don Belk
nap, ran into a little of Techs en
gineering training after the meet 
Saturday. While pointing out his 
claims as to why Case did not 
compete in the javelin throw, he 
maintained that Case went strict
ly according to N.C.A.A. rules and 
that this association did not recog
nize that event as official. One of 
Techs brilliant scientists came up 
with a 1946 NCAA rule book 
though, and made him eat his 
words.
One of the laughs of the track 
meet was provided by Bill Thur.- 
hursts efforts in the discus event. 
The big guy had obviously been 
out too much the night before and 
all the grunting and groaning of 
Bill Scott couldnt get the disc 
to the 100 mark.

Due to the fact that nobody has

that Tech will be well-represent

The Tartan track team opened 
the outdoor track season last Sat
urday when they tackled Case in 
the Bowl, and Tech officials went 
home sadder but wiser men. In the 
first place they learned that 
judges for the turns were neces
sary, and secondly they found that 
more definite agreements with the 
visiting team were in order. As a 
direct result of the latter, nobody 
has yet decided who won the meet 
and probably wont.
ConfusionConfusion
The meet will long be remem
bered by those present as one of 
the most confusing matters which 
faced the officials. Who won? Ac
cording to Tech fans, Tech did. 
According to Case fans, Case did. 
According to the school authori
ties, the meet will be striken from 
the books. Heres the deal.
The javelin throw is banned in 
Ohio (from whence Case came), 
consequently the visitors had en
tered no one in the event. Tech 
was under the impression that this 
event would naturally take place 
and proceded to take three places 
and 9 points for it. If it is to be 
counted, Tech wins. If not Case 
wins.
Sherwood Takes High Hurdles
The whole affair started peace
fully enough as Tech got away to 
an early lead when Jack Sher
wood sailed over the high hurdles 
to the tune of 16.2 seconds to win. 
Bill Beamer, known to Skibo root
ers for his pre-war antics on the 
oval, put on an amazing burst of 
speed to overtake Pokrant of Case 
on the last turn of the mile run 
and come across the finish line 
first with a large smile on his puss. 
Borowski of Tech finished third to 
give the home team a lead of 11-7 
at this point. Case wasnt content 
with its lot and proceded to erase 
the deficit and go ahead with wins 
in the next two events. Speedy 
Jack Miller of Case took the cen
tury in 10.4 and Circirello of the 
visitors edged out his team-mate, 
Bacik, in the last few strides of 
the 440 to finish in 53.2. It was this 
event which produced a shower 
of protest from the Tech footing 
section. Cicirello, quite obviously, 
fouled Bob Kindi on the first turn 
as he cut in and knocked Bob off 
stride. Rapid Robert had to re
cover and circle the field and as a 
consequence, could do no better 
than third. The ensuing squawk 
went for naught as there were 
no officials at the scene of the in
cident.
Relic put Case further in the 
lead as he ran away from every
one but his shadow to nail the 
two-mile run in the sweet time of 
10:52.4. Lars Djorou who is fresh 
from Sweden and has only been 
out for track a few days finished 
second for Tech and promises to 
be a very valuable asset to the 
Tartan cause in future meets.
The visitors picked up another 
point as Rogers won the pole vault 
with a Bad-apple 10-feet vault. 
Balfrey and Ware tied for second 
to give Tech four points.
Allohen of Case then stepped 
up and barely passed Dong Jack 
Sherwood at the finish to sail 
home in 14.5 seconds in the 120 
yard low hurdle.
At this point Case had a lead of 
36-27 when Techs superiority in 
the weights began to make itself 
evident. Bill Scott picked up the 
big lead hunk and tossed it 399 
to win the shot put with Kuntz of 
Case second and Ware of Tech 
third. This cut the Case lead to 
two points, but the visitors turn
ed on the steam to win the 220 
-and 860. Davis of Tech had the 
lead in the 880 all the way up to
the last back stretch when Cicerello made his bid. The Case 
speedster had just a little too much 
and took the lead at the turn to 
win in 2:04.8.
Rlehl Clear 5 9 For First
This made it 50-40, Case and 
the situation was looking dark 
for the home forces. However, 
One-shoe Riehl, Tartan Stalwart, 
cleared the bar easily at 5 9 to 
take the high jump while Freder
icks was trying for third and Tech 
cut down its deficit to 8 points. 
While all this was going on, Scott 
was in the process of taking an
other first place Asche heaved the 
discuss 107 2. Petrus placed sec
ond for Tech and Bill Thunhurst 
made a valiant attempt to nail 
down third place but it seems the 
King had a little too much Beaux 
Arts the night before and wasnt 
up to par. Consequently, Case took 
third place and lead 54%-53% 
with only the broad jump remain
ing. The situation was tense as 
Tech needed first place to tie 
the meet. Fredericks got off the 
best jump of the preliminaries and 
the situation looked pretty good, 
but Teets of Case stopped fouling 
long enough to sail 18 6 to take 
the event and Bayes came up with 
a leap also as long to give Case 
eight points in the event and the 
lead in the meet 62%-54%.
At this point, the results came in 
that Scott and Co. had finished 
one-two-three in he javelin. That 
would give Tech nine points and 
the meet 63%-62% but the Case 
coach, Don Belknap, had some
thing to say on the subject and 
he and Guy Halferty were last 
seen in a big huddle. Oh well, the 
boys had a good time and records 
arent what make a team anyhow.

Welch Grabs Badminton 
Title; SKB Takes Soccer
This week saw the crowning of three intramural champs 
the S.K.B.s in soccer, the Welch Hall outfit in badminton and 
Tom Adkins as individual badminton champ.
WELCH CLINCHES TITLE
In the weeks badminton matches, the Phi Kaps nosed out 
the Beta Sigs 3-2 while the sisterhood of Beta Theta Pi came 
thrqugh with identical wins over the S.A.E.s and D.U.s by 
twin scores of 3-1. Led by Andy Sarrvihano, the Welch team 
overcame the last obstacle in their quest for the title when 
they whitewashed Noble Scobell

Mr. X the Technically Trained 
Engineer would undoubtedly, it is
3-0 to clinch the championship. 
They wound up the campaign with 
a record of five wins and a big 
goose-egg in the loss column.
S. K. B.s Way in Front 
In the broken foot department, 
Clyod Mellotts S. K. B. team 
reigned supreme. The high-scor
ing aggregation ran rampant over 
all opposition and wound up the 
season with 5 up and 0 down. Last 
week they racked up their final 
two wins in trampling the Delts, 
8-0 and the PiKAs 12-1. The team 
ran up 38 goals in the four games 
they played while their opposition 
scored only twice in the same 
number. Around the rest of the 
league, the Betas topped the 
S. A. E.s 6-4, then the S. A. E.s 
lost a heartbreaker to the Tau 
Delts. The regulation game wound 
up in a 5-5 tie but the Tau Delts 
were given the nod because of the 
rule which awards the win to the 
team with the greatest number of 
corner kicks.

There would not be a problem in 
his field that he could not solve. 
There would not be even a tiny 
bit of knowledge of his occupation 
that would be lacking to him. But 
he would know nothing about the 
world outside his laboratory, and 
he therefore would care nothing 
about it. He would be unable to 
think clearly upon political and 
economic problems because he 
would know nothing about them. 
He would not get along well with 
others because he would not un
derstand them, and he would have 
nothing to do with his leisure 
time other than to continue his 
research because he would not 
know of the great pleasure that 
can be obtained from the creation 
or of the appreciation of art forms.

awakening. The thinkers worry 
because they know that while he 
is buried in his laboratory, Mr. X 
is a positive and a negative men
ace to the social order. He is a

Mushball and Ping-Pong Started
This week the Womens Athletic 
Association badminton tournament 
came to a close with Kitty Mc
Kenna defeating June Haskell. 
This'tournament is not to be con
fused with the one held for the 
members of the regular badmin
ton gym classes, which was won 
by Betts Baur. The W. A. A. 
tournament is open to all girls 
whether or not they are taking 
physical education.
A table tennis tournament is 
being arranged now. A sign-jup 
sheet is posted on the W. A. A. 
bulletin board in the womens 
locKer room. The mushball season 
has-, opened and practices are 
scheduled for Wednesday at 3;30 
and Friday at 4:30. So far only 
ten girls have come out, bra^g 
col4 weather and ridicule to have 
a l^t of fun. Tennis and ^rchery 
will get Tinder way after spring 
vacation, when the regular gym 
schedule will be partially rear
ranged to take care of outdoor 
sports. 
Petitions are now due for posi
tions on the W.A.A. Board. To be 
eligiblf fojr the oar<l a girl must
have earned her numerals and 
must hand in a petition signed by 
twenty girls. These petitions 
should be turned in at the office 
in the Womens Gym before the 
end of this week.
The outgoing seniors on the 
Board will confer with the gym 
teachers to prepare a slate of of
ficers to be voted on at the all
school election. Vacancies on the 
Board, which consists of nine 
members, are filled iyom those

new members will be chosen.
xnocracy, which is based on the 
assumption of the intelligence of 
voters, of one of the most intelli
gent minds of his time. The vacu
um left by the absence of his in
telligently cast ballot may be filled 
by the vote of a stupid man who 
has been swayed by the raving of 
demagogues. Mr. X may be a posi
tive menace to society by failing 
to consider fully the importance oi 
the personalities about him. He 
may deeply wound those who love 
him because he considers them 
automatons subservient to him and 
to his study. He may come to be 
a charge upon the state because 
he does not know enough about 
the functions and the value of 
money to spend it wisely. The 
man with a brain owes it to so
ciety to be broadly as well as 
deeply educated. He owes it to 
himself to be interested in the life 
around him.
Mr. Catullo will ask how the 
subjects he is studying now in 
Soc. Eel. can aid him to be a full 
participant in the drama of life, 
how they can help him to pay his 
debt to society. Specifically how 
then can the study of Ancient his
tory, of literature, of economics 
and of psychology aid him in 
achieving these ends? The study 
of ancient history can make him 
understand fully the problems, 
economic, political, and social, 
which have confronted mankind 
since the beginning of time. It can 
cast light upon these perennially 
human problems as they are mani
festing themselves today. The 
study of literature can give the 
engineer glimpses into the minds 
of other men throughout the ages. 
A knowledge of good books can 
bring comfort to him and a feel
ing of oneness with manekind. 
Study of the modern economic 
world can make Mr. X better able 
to cope with his own financial 
problems and less afraid of the 
new economic systems which be
cause of their strangeness are 
frightening the people of our land 
today. The study of psychology 
can bring to the engineer insight 
into his own problems and sym
pathy for the problems of others.
We grant that the Soc. Rel. pro
gram as it is offered today at Car
negie is not as good as it should 
be. Some of the textbooks in the 
course are dull. Some of the profs 
are boring. But the idea is sound, 
and those students who approach 
the courses with a positive atti
tude will find that they learn 
from them how to be better citi
zens of the world and happier in
dividuals.

and creative musician whose 
many works are generally well 
liked by the; more critical analyists of modem music.
The Symphonys performance of 
the Concertino marks the first 
time that this work has been 
heard locally. Although it is what 
might be termed modern music, 
it is instrumentally excellent, 
having brightness ai\ d life 
throughout. The three short move
ments which make it up; Tocca
ta, Elegiatta and Finale, are 
each commanding, in tonal and 
melodic construction, and each is 
a masterpiece of careful crafts
manship, although at no time does 
the music seem heavy or labored.
It. is our belief, that this work 
will be heard again here in the 
near future along with other 
works from the pen of this ex
ceptional musician. Well known 
and beloved by thg many students 
in the Music Department, Mr. 
Lopatnikoff is a staff member of 
which Carnegie Te^h ihay well be 
proud.

NORMAN DAWES
Dr. Norman H. Dawes falls in 
the category of one of our most 
popular profs. Liked by all stu
dents, his tough exams are 
counterbalanced by his wit and 
good humor.
In 1927 Dr. Dawes received his 
A. B. Degree from Boston Uni
versity, where he was quite out
standing in campus activities, es
pecially politics. He received his 
Masters Degree from Harvard in 
1928. From 1931 to 1933 he work
ed toward his Doctors Degree and 
in February, 1946, this degree was 
conferred upon him by Harvard 
 University.
Dr. Dawes first came to Car
negie Tech in 1928 as an instruc
tor of history. Going to his first 
class in Margaret Morrison, he 
laughed at the idea of a twentytwo year old professor teaching in 
college. Also, he now admits be
ing scared by his first class. He 
has taught classes in American 
History, History of Art and Civil
ization <HAC to you), Growth of 
Social Ideas, Social Nature of 
Art, English, and, during the war, 
Geography.
A ten acre estate in Famworth. New Hampshire is where 
the Dawes family spends its 
summers. At the Summer White
House, the familys name for their 
summer home, Dr. Dawes is sur
rounded with his interests and 
hobbies: there are vegetable gar
dens and nine flower gardens. 
Once he thought of playing pro
fessional golf. His interest in sing
ing has led him to participate in 
the Music Department Chorus.
Being a wonderfully versatile 
person, Dr. Dawes lectures to 
Womens Clubs and (this will no 
doubt increase his popularity with 
feminine students.) he believes 
women are smarter than men 
when it comes to international af
fairs. He is also chairman of the 
Tri-State Committee of Educa
tion, Scientists, and Religious 
leaders on Atomic Energy.
About Tech, Dr. Dawes says, I 
love it. This is really where I got 
my education. But the nicest thing 
is that here I met my wifeCar
negie Techs richest gift.
Frosh Girls Give 
Dance Program
The freshman girls from Fine 
Arts, Margaret Morrison, and En
gineering exhibited their talents 
on Friday, April 12, at 4:30 when 
they gave a program of Modern 
Dance. The program is the result 
of their semesters work and the 
girls certainly enjoyed giving the 
program.
Such titles as Follow, Follow, 
Follow; Frustration; and Looking 
for Something were given the va
rious dances. One was even cun
ningly called Lines and Circles. 
The performers were attired dif
ferently for each act. Some wore 
skin tight leotards in various col
ors, some wore skirts and T shirts, 
and some wore shorts and blouses.
Some ci the sophomores gave 
serious numbers; one was called 
Justice and the other Search for 
Freedom. Everyone who attended, 
including the PiKAs, had an en
joyable time. Modern dance though 
of classic origin is a recent addi
tion to the arts field. As such the 
performance was a fascinating 
combination of rhythm, grace, and 
artistic interpretation through the 
medium of dance.

8THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 16, 1946
LOU UMBACH
He was hunting for a good en
gineering school and so he chose 
Tech (no cracks), and Tech is 
glad he did because a nicer guy 
than Louis Umbach would be 
hard to find. Lou comes from Cin
cinnati and is a senior electrical 
engineer.
Lou, who is Treasurer of Theta 
Xi and a member of Student 
Council, was also Treasurer of 
Tau Beta Pi (they must trust him 
or something), president of Eta 
Kappa Nu, and vice-president of 
Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Kap
pa Phi, and the Radio Club. He 
is on the Spring Carnival Bazaar 
Committee and is one of the Techsperts.
He said he had a love life and 
that was all, but its been reported 
that he has reached the point 
where hr date a girl unless
she has a 42 Buick. Anyway he 
is one of those exceptions that 
crop u ' every now and then who 
likes his women both beautiful 
and smart. There are six feet of 
Lou topped off with hazel eyes 
and brown hair so the girls 
arent losing anything in the deal 
either.
Lou just doesnt like the ad
ministration at all, and he is glad 
to have it printed, glad, glad, 
GLAD, do you hear? He also ob
jects to the fact that Tech is in 
Pittsburgh. Hed like it anyplace 
else he says, the reasonwhy, the 
smoke, of course. Getting back 
to the administration (and he 
cant blame Techs location on 
them  We dont think, he 
says they dont allow Student 
Council enough power. They 
arent allowed to govern the 
school, and Lou believes they 
should be.
His room is all littered up with 
radio stuff so we guess we may 
safely assume that radio is one of 
his hobbies. The other one is boy 
scouting; Lou just loves to go on 
camping trips. He likes symphon
ies and playing ping-pong (in his 
spare time), and he plays bridge, 
which he thinks is a social neces
sity. (This alone makes him eligi
ble for a degree.) He doesnt 
smoke or drink (here is where 
we could make a nasty crack 
but wont) and also likes to 
dance. When asked with whom, 
he said, Whomever I have a dat 
with, which is decidedly encour
aging.
Lou works part time as a sound 
technician. He says he has as 
many hours of meetings a week 
as he has class. This should make 
life gay because for the first time 
since he has been here he is
carrying a light schedule. And his 
average factor is 3.1 too.
Lou says he likes Tech women 
the more the merrier'but he 
doesnt like women who dress 
messy, though he realizes that fre
quently they have tb dress that 
way and so should be excused. 
On the whole they are attractive, 
and he is one of those who advo
cates a sloppy, leisure college life 
anyway, so he is perfectly happy 
at Tech.
Another of his likes and dis
likes and then this column will 
close. Lou hates the Soc-Rel pro
gram at Tech (as far as can be 
seen, he isnt the only one) in 
fact he has gone as far as to say 
the whole program is useless; and 
since he is a second semester sen
ior, he can get away with it. He 
does like the Frat system, this 
may be due in part to the fact 
that he is a senior, and that there 
are thirteen pladges in the Theta 
Xi House.
Hey You Hepcats! 
Dig the Jive Talk
One of the oddest expressions to 
emerge from this war is the al
literative hubba-hubba. It had 
its origin in the Aviation Cadet 
Pre-Flight Center in Santa Ana, 
California. Whenever the cadets 
were pleased or were supposed 
to be happy (by order of Lieuten
ant Hardnose), their cadet com
mander roared Lets have a great 
big hubba-hubba. And the everobedient cadets would roar Hubba-hubba-hubba as fast as they 
could. After graduation from their 
cadet training program, the fliers 
carried this expression with them 
into advanced training overseas, 
and back into civilian life. The 
bobby soxers picked it up some
where along the line, slowed it 
down, and said it like Bacall. A 
tunesmith made up a song for it 
and juke-boxes and Perry Como 
spread hubba-hubba's fame all 
over the country. Just exactly 
what it means is known only to 
those who know Dr. R. H. Coo 
personally.

round-the-clock wearing. Metro
politan Museum prints appeared 
on shantungs. Eyelet embroidered 
cotton was featured in both even
ing and date-time frocks. Colors 
for the most part were lively, but 
muted.
' Girls in their junior and senior 
years who are students of Clothing 
and Design, Retailing of Clothing 
and Textiles, as well as Teacher 
Training Sequences, modeled 
clothes made in regular college 
classes.
