Again the Panther and the Plaid are to tan*, gle for the football, championship of the City f Pittsburgh' and the-honor of, the sport. All the. color .and glory of the season's finest, football. classic in the tri-state district -will mark this, the tenth conflict between Carnegie Tech' and-the-University 0f Pittsburgh, on Saturday 
aftemoori. *. The, brand of football displayed by the Tar*, tan team in its previous games, this year, notwithstanding itadefeut by Wsh-Jeif on Saturday,, merits tbe expectation of a repetition of the. memorable games of .1923 and'1924 with the.Pitt elevens,, inasmuch as'this years, record for the latter does not justify some of th glowing reports of optimistic sport writers.' The ' .Camegio teanj. appears to be the strongest in years and. regardless of th outcome'of'Satur-. days'gaine, there' is little doubt .but 'that the . contest" will , be -one .of theigreatest spectacles . in the history of the' two -ecioplsi ' 1 : VThe.'Carnegie-Pitt scores for the past nine . gamesshejis ; som interesting light, .upon the Plaids rise in.gridiron circles :   'Pitt Carnegie

EDITOEIAL POINT OF VIEW
..Toti watch the so-called Fine Arts, said 
my .companion to me, by way of closing a pro
longed discussion, and you will see. them 
gradually . being assimilated; -with every-da.vlife and routine. Where r^e your, long, haired 
prophets of ehe last gcneration,7"vyith\ their 
yag'e insistence on 'Art for Arie Si^e/.vrith' 
their theories' that, painting. and .ihnsio.are 
'things aloof, above the mob, without a .pra-, 
tical evaluation f They and their entire jargon 
of aesthetics lie buried, to eyer remain a cast 
.off bi-produot of an unpractical era. Today 
.the arts have a social import; they have be
come highly important weapons in the hands 
of the educators and moralists.
We were speeding eastward on a long Santa.. 
Fe train. Late at nightand from-the obser
vation, platform we watched an occassional 
green 'signal: fade until it became identified 
with the bold, headlight of the. following seer 
tion. Arts and'educative processes. My friend 
was a journalist from .Kansas City. He ob
served folks every day ; observed socialtrends,
Oive me an ordinary eating joint,. of the' 
Pittsburgh variety, let me dress' it up with cre
tonne curtains, plasterthe wallfi with Renais
sance ornament,'fill the cornere with Roman 
statues, lighten it with mellowed electricity, 
incense mildly withTontines, and no matter 
how painful'* Pyrex plate lunch the particular 
Greek huckster who runs'tiie salon has to "offer, I will carefnlly lay.away ten stocking fulls 
of gold coins'a-week,'solid profit. -.
Give me a town hall full of womepa fall 
symphony .orchestra, a baton swinger, from a 
large city, and let me' causethe, thrilling'pas
sages of Tschaiflowsky a 1812, Overture , to 
be sounded, ana I will have on my hands regfervor.
r Take any first ra'te oratorwell modulated 
voice, easy to look, atgive him a beautiful 
Gothic building, "fill tbe nave with high school, 
boys and girls, balance the picture nicely with 
stained gIass,.soft lights, finely chiseled image, 
a-lavish organ with a vox humano stop-V 
and the sky pilot will have at his command ' 
such a psychological palate that he may at 
will. draWv forth the tears or thesighs, may 
gather about himself scores of converts to anycause,he may be representing, whether it .be horee racing or polygamy.  .
And so does thia proatitution of the arts looin 
up as an important feature of our practical, 
times. Prostitution of music as a background - 
to our eating manners,prostitution, .of the yis ' 
ual 'and dramatic ar^s by . the moralist and 
propagandist to produce th emotional .effects 
h desires. Sociological investigationhaa it" 
that the arts may. be^utilized in feform work, 
in tlie prisons, may tie psychologically valuable
in the clearing up of. mental derangement. 
The harvest seems plentiful and the field is 
just beginning to be explored. . '
And. to .my friends acute observing I 
could but think of three7 quotations which ;say 
sometime cause a practical world to revise its 
volues.'-

The dwindling of sunny autumnal days and 
the rapid onrush of . winter has again summond to fore the annual, issue of coal, warmth 
end smoke-. Within & few weeks Pittsburgh 
will be-within the grip of a sun-covering 6moke 
which will feed, and garner its strength from 
thousands of homes and large industrial concerns'coily to overdrape the city with its soft, 
floaty black p'artidei... With an urged inten
tion to combat this carbonizer of cities scienti-1 
-fically, Prsident Baker has issued invitations 
to mayors or  city . managers . of sixty large 
industrial centers and to .every governor in the 
United-States, welcoming their delegates to the 
International-Coal. Conference which will open 
at Carnegie,November Hr 
 Industrial scientists r have long recognized 
the import .of ; eliminating smoke from the. fac
tory system,, since imperfect combustion is an 
economic waste and adds materially to iuel 
and power .costs. Even wjth' more adequate 
heating-'systems, the. thermal-effectiveness of 
the coal is not entirely utilizedandmany by
products . ascend.as smoke* and shower the vicuirty with, its worthless remains.
But conservation and btter utilization of 
coal-has directed coal ! research, during the 
past few years toward pre-heating of soft coal 
to podude oils, gases'nd other .valuable by
products . and then marketing, the residue, a 
semi-cake or char, as a, smokeless solid fuel for 
industrial and . domestic purposes. Various 
methods - and experiments - to - obtain these. spe
cific.coal. products will be .presented by inter
national. coai. authorities and' the conference 
hopes-to clear whether such processes, are commefciallyfasihre. " \ -. ~
.-:'Dr. Baker, will, bring to the conference a' 
group of world minent, scientists who have ad
vanced the study of scientific and rational util* 
:ization of soft coal through., their research. Be
sides discussing smokless fuels, which isone 
of, the many problems oo-related to the morfes 
general 'topic of how. to'make bituminouscoal 
more valuablo, the conference will streas such qu^tions>sas themanufacturing of .substitutes 
for gasolide from coal; high and low tempera
ture carbonization, by-products,, pulverized 
coaV and power. .... -- These.subjects of discussion'have-created a 
wide interest among ..scientific and goveruT 
mental.circles in the :United.States and hrod 
and.it is likely'tJiat many unknown factors^of 
 importance,-regarding : industrialcoal, will be 
clarified. , :
