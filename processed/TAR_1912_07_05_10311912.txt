jfScoreless Game With Grove City y
t ""------- ----fU
GENERAL LECTURE.
With a badly crippled team playing 
on a heavy, muddy field, our warriors 
were unable to score against the 
weightier Grove City team. While our 
men were not outclassed in weight so 
much as against W. & J., a difference 
in avoirdupois was apparent. And 
five of the best of the first string 
men were out of the game. These in
cluded Capt. Crawford, Taylor, De 
Muth, Heisel and Hubler. The men 
from the second team who filled the 
vacancies deserve great credit for the 
game.
The contest, taken as a whole, was 
dull and slow, affording few thrills. 
Open play was attempted' often, but 
resulted in few real gains. Most of 
our gains were made on line plunges, 
Metheny carrying the ball oftenest. 
Grove City gained by punting, Sam 
Veach booting the oval for longer 
spirals than Metheny.
Fulmer and Engstrom starred on 
the line, recovering fumbles, breaking up forward passes, and tackling 
runners. Paterson also performed 
sensationally at tackling. The de
fensive work of the team was better 
than in any of last three games, the 
line holding the big Grove City backs 
repeatedly for no gain. Hall and 
Stonerod, alternating at quarter, ran 
the team well, but both showed up at 
a disadvantage when carrying the 
ball, because of extreme lightness. 
Ache and Park both made gi>od gains, 
but the former had some difficulty in 
holding the ball, due, no doubt, to its 
slippery condition. McCaughey, as 
usual, was a tower of strength at 
guard, and handled the team as field 
captain.
But two of twelve attempted for
ward passes by the Plaid team suc
ceeded, netting a total gain of 22 
yards. Grove City tried fifteen times, 
their sole successful pass gaining 25 
yards.
The game was delayed often by dis
putes over rules, in which the of
ficials showed an apparent lack of 
knowledge of the game. The Red and 
White team also played slow ball, de
laying their plays in a manner that 
irritated the spectators. As a con
sequence, over two hours elapsed be
tween the starting whistle and the 
end of the game.
In the first quarter the ball was kept 
between our thirty-yard line and
Grove Citys 20 mark. Metheny
kicked off to the 25-yard line, and
Grove City failed to gain through the 
line, kicking on fourth down to
Metheny, who returned 20 yards to 
the Red and White 35 mark, a series 
of plunges taking it to the 20 line. A 
penalty r ding set us back 15
units, and Grove City took the ball 
on downs, Veach kicking to the 
middle of the field. The pig-skin was 
kept close to this mark until near the 
end of the period, when a 15-yard 
penalty for holding placed it on our 
30-yard line. Metheny punted to the 
center line as the whistle blew.
The second quarter was similar to 
the first, except that Grove City car
ried the ball on a series of runs from 
their 25-yard line to our 16 mark, 
Veach and Kiskaddon doing the work. 
There they lost the ball on a fumble, 
Engstrom recovering, and Metheny 
kicked back to the center mark. The 
quarter ended with the ball on our 30- 
yard line.
In the third period, punting was the 
feature. After a lively exchange of 
kicks, Veach took the ball to our 25- 
yard line, where Engstrom intercepted 
a forward pass. We lost the ball on 
downs, but Metheny caught another 
forward pass from Veach, and punted 
to Grove City territory. Two forward 
passes took the ball to our 30 mark, 
but Hall grabbed a third and ran back 
30 yards. Metheny threw to Peterson

Course Started Wednesday Morning 
With Talk by Supt. Heeter.
At the request of the Students 
Welfare Committee, the course of 
General Lectures, so popular last 
year, has been transferred from the 
second to the first semester this year. 
These lectures were deservedly pop
ular and the new men, who as yet 
do not know their .value, and some 
of whom were absent or late last 
Wednesday morning, should see to 
it that they are present on time, for 
the benefit is ours, that these men 
should come and give us part of their 
time, to broaden our minds in vari
ous fields of endeavor.
Dean Leete gave a brief outline of 
the course this year and introduced 
the speaker, Mr. S. L. Heeter, Super
intendent of the Public Schools of 
Pittsburgh. He got us into a recep
tive mood at the start by saying, that 
he liked the word Applied, which 
appears in the names of each of the 
three mens schools. This in direct 
contrast to mere schools of theory, 
where its principles taught are not 
applied to the problems of life.
His talk, on the whole, was ab
stract, and he pointed out how in 
many schools, including the lower 
grade schools and High Schools of 
the city, the endeavor is being made 
to separate the practical from the 
theoretical, to teach proficiency along 
certain definite lines, since this is 
surely the day of specialists.
Mr. Heeters talk was helpful and 
entertaining, and we look forward 
with great pleasure to any future vis
its he may care to pay us.

TRACK MEET.
Saturday, November 2d, at 10:00 A. 
M., there will be a triangle meet be
tween the Plebes of the three Schools, 
the winners to be given the custody 
of the Plebe trophy for the coming 
year. This trophy is now held by'the 
School of Applied Science, having 
been won last year by the Plebe Class 
of that School. All regular track and 
field events will be contested by rep
resentatives from the three classes. 
Insignia will be awarded the winners 
of first, second, and third places in 
each event.
The meet last year was a great 
success, being hotly contested 
throughout and bringing forth much 
promising material. A number of men 
from each class have been training 
regularly of late and everything indi
cates a still better meet this year.
The Plebes both of the Industries 
and of the Design Schools have a 
number of strong men out and the 
Science Plebes must look to their 
laurels.
A word to all loyal Carnegie root
ers, especially upper-classmen, Be 
There. The continuance of our su
premacy in track athletics depends 
upon the material that is developed 
from the incoming classes from year 
to year. Therefore, show that you 
have the true Carnegie spirit by being 
on hand next Saturday morning to 
encourage these new men and to get 
a line on their abilities as well. Think, 
too, what an opportunity it will give 
you to get in on the I told you so 
squad next spring when some of these 
new men are breakin'g Western Penn
sylvania records. Why not? Remem
ber, Saturday, November 2d, at 10.00 
A. M., and Be There.

It is with sincere regret that The 
Tartan announces the resignation of 
Mr. Edward E. Duff, Jr., from the 
position of News Editor he has so 
capably filled the year past. Mr. Duff 
feels that the demand upon his time 
was too great and his decision has
lost, not only to The Tartan but to the student-body at large, one of the most 
interested and faithful workers in the 
student activities at Carnegie.

The Tartan desires to announce the 
appointment of Mr. Charles E. Gil
son, of the Class of 1914, to the po
sition of Assistant News Editor, and 
of Mr. W. I. Wilson, of the class 
of 1916, to the position of Assistant 
to the Athletic Editor.

Last week The Tartan put the ques
tion of working for the Morewood 
Avenue Entrance before the students. 
Have you done your share? Have 
YOU seen a single voter and put the 
proposition up to him? Or have you 
been one of those jelly-fish creatures 
who are content to say, Let the other 
fellow do it?
This is a student matter and you, 
as a student, should recognize the 
fact by working, really working, for 
the budget. Spread the information 
concerning the issue around where it 
will do some good. At the expense 
of being considered vulgar, we urge 
YOU to show you have GUTS by 
going after what you want. That is 
the only way that YOU and the rest 
of us can get the Morewood Avenue 
Approach. Lets get down and work.

At the game last Saturday, The 
Tartan was struck by the poor work 
of the cheering section. It is true 
that, owing to the condition of the 
field, the game was slow and there 
were not many plays made calling for 
wild enthusiasm. Nevertheless, the 
men in the cheering section did not 
do their duty, either to their college 
or to their cheer leaders. The lead
ers were not followed carefully by the 
men in the stands, and there was a 
decided lack in volume. Let us see 
if by the next game we cannot work 
up a little spirit of co-operation and 
have some unity in our cheering. Let 
us see if we can not work up a little 
enthusiasm and have some volume to 
cur cheers.
c--------------o---------------
It may be that The Tartan is old 
fashioned in its ideas, but it does 
NOT like to hear cris of approval 
from the stands when our rival on 
the field is penalized. It was not, of 
course. All the persons in stands 
who did cheer and otherwise disport 
themselves upon such occasions. Such 
persons were in the minority. But 
the majority did not think enough 
about the matter, apparently, to make 
objection to the actions of the few. 
We wonder if this cheering favorable 
and hooting unfavorable decisions is 
a tendency of the age or merely the 
lack of balance upon the part of a few. 
Whatever it may be, it is not pretty 
coming from a body of college stu
dents and we trust that if others feel 
as we do about it they will so ex
press themselves at the next game as 
to make repetition of the practice out 
of the question.
---------------o---------------
MANY THANKS.
The students of the School of Ap
plied Science wish to most heartily 
thank the kind benefactor who're
cently authorized the installation of 
the mirrors in the toilet rooms. For 
four long years we have waited pa
tiently but in vain, and now we must 
no longer hunt? a dirty window in 
which to reflect our visage, but may 
see ourselves as others see us in our 
brand new mirrors. As previously 
announced,many thanks.
---------------o-------------*
KEEP THE GOOD WORK UP.
We are grateful for the mirrors, 
we are grateful for the individual 
towels, but are not yet satisfied. It 
takes no Doctor of Medicine, no stu
dent of bacteriology to prove the fact 
that the common drinking cup car
ries more infectious diseases, more 
germs, than any other article of its 
size. Individual drinking cups are 
the logical, sensible, hygienic solu
tion of the problem, and for these 
we would also be grateful.

NOTICE TO MANAGERS.
The Student Census cards are now 
on file in the office of the Student 
Activities Bureau. Managers may re
fer to these at any time when looking 
for new material. The following 
gives a partial summary of the num
ber of men interested in the various 
activities:
Football, 93; Baseball, 101; Basket
ball, 105; Track, 96; Tennis, 81; 
Hockey, 33; Golf, 7; Gym Team, 44;

It was with deep regret that the 
Alumni Association of the Schools of 
Applied Science and Applied Design 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology learned of the sad death of 
Frederick A. Schmucker, Jr., and in 
a regular meeting, October 14th, 1912, 
the following resolution was adopted: 
Whereas, Frederick A. Schmuck
er, Jr., of the class of 1909, has, 
on the fourteenth day of October, 
1912, passed into the great be
yond, and
Whereas, The members of the 
Alumni desire and deem it most 
fitting to express the feeling of 
loss sustained by them at his 
death.
Therefore, Be it resolved that 
we, the members of the Alumni, 
do hereby express our sorrow for 
his death.
Resolved, That we extend to 
the bereaved family of Mr. 
Schmucker our deep sympathy in 
this, their great sorrow.
Resolved, That a copy of these 
resolutions be spread upon the 
minutes of the Association; that 
the same be published in The 
Tartan and Alumni Bulletin, and 
that a copy be prepared and sent 
to the family of our late mem
ber.

THE TARTAN. 3
FORMER TECH STUDENT AN 
AERONAUT.
One of the best balloon ascensions 
ever made from the Cobleskill fair 
grounds, and which was of unusualinterest to Schoharie county people, 
was made Friday afternoon by Isaac 
Slingerland, of the firm of Slingerland 
Bros., of Cobleskill.
Mr. Slingerland had sought an intro
duction to J. J. Gannon, the man mak
ing the ascensions, early in the week 
and asked permission to make the 
flight, but the weather conditions being 
so unfavorable he had not obtained the 
required permission.
However, the persistency of Mr. 
Slingerland won out and he donned the 
suit and prepared for his initial trip 
up in a balloon. He had some knowl
edge of the upper air, having made a 
flight in one of the Wright machines 
driven by Mr. Parmlee at the State 
fair a year ago.
His observations, experiences and 
comparisons, as given to an Index re
porter, are, indeed, interesting. He 
left the ground at 6:01 p. m., with 
the wind nearly eastward. When he 
had reached an altitude of 2,000 feet, 
he struck a different air current, veer
ing in a south easterly direction, which 
continued until this altitude was again 
reached in descent. As soon as the 
attendants let go it seemed as though 
the earth were quietly slipping away.
The balloon was without vibration. 
There was no feeling of dizziness or 
nausea from any height. The queer 
sensations always experienced by Mr. 
Slingerland when riding in elevators 
were entirely lacking here. In making 
a flight in an aeroplane, the earth does 
not seem to move away, the machine 
seems to rise from the ground. The 
contrast between a flight in an aero
plane and a balloon ascension is as 
marked as that between riding in an 
automobile and a motor boat. .
At a given signal (a pistol shot) 
from Mr. Gannon, and two minutes 
from the time he left the grounds, at 
a height of 6,000 feet, he cut loose from 
the balloon and began his descent in 
the first parachute Until this time, 
his sensations were such as any one 
would be pleased to experience.
Before cutting loose, he had time to 
enjoy what appeared like a plan view 
of Cobleskill and the surrounding coun
try. To give an idea of the size of 
objects, the race track appeared about 
the size of a dinner plate; the buildings 
were small; it was impossible to dis
tinguish a single individual, but groups 
appeared as a dark mass. From the 
highest elevation the Cobleskill reservoir 
was plainly seen. The Cobleskill creek 
wound its way through the valley like 
a single thread, closely followed by the
railroad tracks. The highways show
ed as white lines.
As soon as he cut loose there was 
something else doing. There was no 
time for making observations for he 
was rapidly descending, dropping 100 
feet before the parachute fully opened. 
Then a checking of the speed occurred 
with a slight upward motion, caused 
by the cushioning effect of the air. De
scending a thousand feet, he cut loose 
from the first parachute and began the 
final descent. The drop this time was 
about 80 feet, the difference being caused 
by sustaining the weight of but one 
parachute. As soon as the second para
chute was opened, Mr. Slingerland un
snapped the safety belt and began mak
ing preparations to land, which was 
effected in the pasture lot of Welling
ton Hilts, on the Mineral Springs road, 
north of the public highway.
The balloon landed in a tree in the 
vicinity of Donats mountain. After 
folding up the parachute, Mr. Slinger
land started for the highway, where he 
was met by Dr. H. H. Fox and son, 
Harold, and later by Ernest Borst with 
the Slingerland car. The trip was de
lightful from start to finishsatisfac
torily fulfilling a long cherished dream.
Mr. Slingerland was a graduate in 
1910 from Electrical Equipment and 
Construction in the School of Applied 
Industries. He was greatly interested 
in aeronautics and while in school built 
several model aeroplanes and a thirtyfoot monoplane glider. He was active 
in organizing the Tech Aero Club, 
now dormant, and was its first Presi
dent.
After graduation he started a small 
business dealing in aeronautic sup
plies, but gave this up for the elec
trical equipment and construction bus
iness, in which he is now engaged as 
the proprietor of a flourishing company 
in his native town, Cobleskill, N. Y. 
He is one of the type of students 
which is making Carnegie Tech fa
mous.
MUSICAL CLUB NOTES.
Each rehearsal of the Musical Clubs 
brings out new material. The latest 
addition is a harp guitar, an instru
ment that has been needed for some 
time. A Banjo Quartette is also 
an added feature of this years clubs. 
Mr. L. E. Fowler is now engaged in 
putting this department into shape 
and it will be staged in the opening 
concert at McDonald, Penn., on No
vember 15th. A club of this kind 
was started some years ago, but was 
dropped on account of shortage of 
material. It is expected that this 
quartette will develop into a larger 
organization in the future.
At present the Glee Club has about
6227 Penn Avenue 
6222 Frankstown Avenue
STOEBENER
Man Witli Quality Slroes
East End
thirty-five men at rehearsals and the 
Mandolin Club has about thirty. The 
directors will eliminate some of this 
number next week.
The date for the Home Concert has 
practically been decided upon by 
Manager L. E. Griswold and will be 
announced in the near future.
A SECOND ASSISTANT MAN
AGER
A call has been issued for a second 
assistant baseball manager for the 
season of 1913. According to the con
stitution of the C. I. T. A. A., the 
manager of any sport is required to 
post a notice and to wait a reasonable 
length of time for candidates to an
nounce themselves. The names of the 
candidates are then brought before the 
student body of the several men 
schools for election, each school be
ing allowed one second assistant 
manager.
No man who cannot be at the Field 
House every day, and also give a ma
jority of his spare time to the work, 
should not post his name as a candi
date.
ELECTION
At a recent meeting of the Sopho
more class the following officers were 
elected:

many demands on him. Generally 
her requests for favors, usually the 
running of errands around the house, 
were prefaced by what she consider

cut her short.
Well Ethel, he said, earnestly,

ended the period.
In the last quarter, the team and 
rooters wished for the presence of 
Hubler in the game. The ball had 
been carried to the Grove City 30-yard 
line and was in line with the goal 
posts. Metheny dropped back for a

When Charles Darwin was visiting 
the country-house of a friend the two 
boys of the family thought >they 
would play a joke on the scientist. 
So they caught a butterfly, a grass
hopper, a beetle and a centipede, and 
out of these creatures they made a 
strange composite insect. They took 
the centipedes body, the butterflys 
wings, the grasshoppers legs and the 
beetles head and they glued them to
gether carefully. Then, with their 
new bug in a box, they knocked at 
Darwins door.
We caught this bug in a field, 
they said. Can you tell us what 
kind of a bug it is, Mr. Darwin?
Darwin looked at the bug and then 
he looked at the boys. He smiled 
slightly.
Did you notice whether it hummed 
when you caught it, boys? he asked.
Yes, they answered, nudging one 
another.
Then, said Darwin, it is a hum
bug.

Mrs. Taft at a diplomatic dinner, 
had for a neighbor a distinguished

We French, the traveler declared, 
are the politest people in the world. 
Every one acknowledges it. You 
Americans are a remarkable nation, 
but the French excel you in polite
ness. You admit it yourself, dont 
you?
Mrs. Taft smiled delicately.
Yes, she said. That is our po

COACH WALKER APPRECIATED
On Friday evening the football 
squad gathered in the gymnasium af
ter practice, while Dr. Marks pre
sented a handsome gold watch with a 
silver fob to Assistant Coach F. M. 
Walker. Mr. Walker has been giving 
his services voluntarily during the last 
few weeks and is responsible for the 
marked improvement in speed and 
team work. Appreciating this fact, 
the squad presented the watch and 
fob as a token of their esteem. The 
inside of the cover carries this in
scription, Presented by the Carnegie 
Tech Football Squad to F. M. Walker, 
10-25-12, and on the outside are the 
coach's initials in a monogram.
STUDENTS WANT NEW CLUB 
ROOM.
For the past two or three years the 
students of the Applied Industries 
have shown considerable dissatisfac
tion with the room used by them as 
a Club Room, but up until the pres
ent time there seemed to be but little 
chance for betterment of any kind 
owing to the cramped conditions 
which existed in the School. Now 
that the Design School has vacated 
and moved into its own building, the 
sentiment of the progressive element 
of the students demands a change. 
The present Club Room is unsatis
factory in that it probably never was 
intended for a permanent room for 
the accommodation of the students, 
and hence was not fitted or finished 
in an attractive manner; this being 
the case, there seems to be but little 
incentive for the students to keep 
the place in a neat and respectable 
condition. Under existing conditions 
the Student Senate is compelled to 
use stringent means to have the stu
dents keep the Club Room in a pre
sentable manner, whereas, it should 
be that each individual student would 
take a pride and show a personal in
terest in the place by doing his share 
toward keeping it orderly and clean. 
Improvements like this usually come 
by degrees, but why not have the im
provement now? The students of the 
Science School have furnished a room 
for themselves which is a credit to 
themselves and to the. Institution of 
which they form a part, so why cant 
the Industrials? The room in view 
for the proposed new Club Room is 
the one adjacent to the balcony of 
the Foundry, now in use as a locker 
room, and one which is ideal for the 
purpose wanted, in respect to loca
tion and size. If this room can be se
cured, a light assessment from each 
student, both Night and Day, and a 
liberal donation from the School 
should furnish it in the most attrac
tive manner.
The project should be boosted and 
insisted upon as it means much, not 
only to the students now enrolled in 
the School, but to those entering in 
the future, and to all persons con
nected with the School in any way.
Its up to you, Industrials; if you 
want to be a Bull Mooser, join 
the progressive element and do your
share toward a new Club Room; if 
not, resume the fossil attitude and re
main satisfied.

MR. HORNBOSTEL LECTURES.
Mr. Hornbostel, unable to be pres
ent for his usual Monday lecture a 
week ago, postponed it until Thurs
day of that week. His talk was well 
attended by students in all courses 
of the School of Applied Design. Mr. 
Hornbostels Monday morning talks 
treat of the development of plan down 
through the ages. Explaining Egyptian-Assyrian and Greek planning, he 
laid particular emphasis on the adapt
ability of the Greek plans, decorative 
forms, and logical solutions of prob
lems to the more complex motives of 
today. Mr. Hornbostel argues a re
vival of Greek spirit and simplicity 
not alone in theory, his recent 
work is a practical and excellent dem
onstration of it. A continued regu
larity of attendance on the part of 
Mr. Hornbostel will be all that is 
needed to make his course the most 
popular and interesting one in the 
curriculum.

FACULTY SOCIAL
On Saturday evening, October 26. 
the first of a series of social events 
was given by the faculty of the sev
eral schools in order that they might 
become better acquainted with each 
other. The initial gathering took the 
form of an old fashioned get-to
gether church social at the M. M. C. 
S.
The early part of the evening was 
spent in the apartment where every 
one got acquainted, and those who 
were acquainted, renewed old ac
quaintanceships.
This was followed by an extremely 
interesting program which consisted 
of several vocal solos by Mrs. H. J. 
McIntyre, and Mrs. OBrien. Mrs. 
Leighou played the violin and Miss 
E. R. Stoner gave a reading. The All 
Schools Quartet, composed of 
Messrs. Dennison, Anplied Science; 
Meggers, Applied Industries; Geoghegan, Applied Design, and Equerre, M. 
M. C. S., were well received and an
Private Donahue and Private 
Leahy were the best of friends, but 
when Private Donahue became Ser
geant Donahue, Private Leahy saw 
the failing of his former companion 
with amazing clearness.

long-fixed gazing at his superior in 
rank, if a private stepped up to a 
sergeant and called him a consated 
little monkey, phwat would happen?

said the Sergeant.
He wud?
He wud.
But if the private only knew the 
sergeant was consated little monkey 
and said niver a wurrd would he be 
put in the guard-house for that? in
quired Private Leahy.
O? course he wud not, said the 
sergeant, softly.

MORE CONGRATULATIONS.
The following is an editorial that 
appeared in a Washington, Pa., paper: 
Notwithstanding the matter of age 
we believe Washington and Jefferson 
can with profit -follow the example 
of Carnegie Tech in one thing of 
considerable importance to the un
dergraduates. This is in regard to 
class contests. Last week at Tech 
the freshmen and sophomores got 
through with all their hostilities and 
after a love feast settled down to 
real college life. The class scraps 
at the Laird of Skibos school are 
in reality athletic contests in which 
representatives picked from the two 
classes clash in struggles of various 
types. All this class fighting is fin
ished up in the opening week at Tech 
and that is the end of it. The plan 
seems to us a very g^od one. It 
sounds as though it might be a good 
deal better than the method followed 
here where class fights continue over 
the greater part of the opening term 
and where all the available men in 
both classes no matter what their 
age or size or physical condition take 
part.

And you hadnt sense enough to

INJURED.
A certain skeptic was contending 
before a minister that the work of 
the Creator was manifestly imperfect. 
Have you not yourself, he asked, 
noted defects in the human organism, 
for instance, and thought of better 
contrivances?
To his delight there was a frank 
reply,
Why, yes, I really think I have. 
In what respect?
Why, drawled the parson, you 
see when I want to shut out anything 
disagreeable from my sight, I can
