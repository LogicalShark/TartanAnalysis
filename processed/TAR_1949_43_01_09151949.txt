Will Serve This.Year 
As Vice President 
Under Dr, Doherty
Dr. J. C. Warner, Dean of Grad
uate Studies and Head of the 
Chemistry Department at CIT, was 
named President-Elect on June 9 
to succeed Dr. Robert E. Doherty, 
who will retire as President next 
year.
According to James A. Bovard, 
Chairman of the Carnegie Board 
of Trustees, Dr. Warner will fill
Dr. J. C. Warner
 newly-created office of VicePresident until his inauguration 
after Dr. Dohertys retirement, 
July 1, 1950.
For Dr. Warner, the announce
ment of his election climaxes 23 
years of service on the Carnegie 
faculty. An instructor in chem
istry in 1926 after work as a re
search chemist with commercial 
companies, the President-Elect 
moved up the academic ranks to 
become Professor of Chemistry 
and Head of the Chemistry De
partment in 1938, and Dean of 
Graduate Studies in 1945.
Makes Statement
When the official announcement 
of Dr. Warners selection was 
made public, he made the follow
ing statement regarding his posi
tion.
Under the able leadership of 
President Robert E. Doherty, dur
ing the past 12 years Carnegie has 
developed a distinctive program of 
professional education and has 
encouraged scholarly and artistic 
attainments of the highest order 
by steadily increasing the oppor
tunities of research and other cre
ative activities available to the

Class Of 53 Completing
\
Orientation; 650 Enroll
All-School 
Registration 
To Hit 3200
Approximately 3,200 students, 
including about 650 ghtering 
freshmen, are expected to enroll 
during registration this week. This 
represents a decline of about 100 
students from last years enroll
ment, but it is still greater than 
the pre-war high of 2,400.
Besides those coming back from 
last year, Fine Arts will receive 
about 175 new freshmen; College 
of Engineering and Science, 375 
freshmen; and Margaret Morrison 
will receive 125 freshmen.
Also the number of advanced 
standing students has increased 
from 218 last year to 235 this year.
A housing problem still exists, 
but the situation is better than 
in the past few years. Faculty 
and married students will have 
the hardest time finding accom
modations with a slight shortage 
of rooms also existing for single 
male students.
There is ample room for all 
women students living on cam
pus at Morewood Gardens, the re
cently converted apartment build
ing which was opened for the first 
time last year.
As Carnegie enters its fifth post
war year, the ranks of veterans 
are rapidly thinning out. The 
Veterans Center estimates that 
only about 30 per cent of the over
all enrollment will be ex-GIs. The 
greatest concentration of veterans 
will be in the senior class of the 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence, in which approximately 75 
per cent of the students will be 
ex-servicemen.

, Changes in the student and faculty health policy of CIT were 
announced recently in conjunction with the appointment of Dr. O. 
Grant Reed as school physician.
Dr. Reed will initiate an extensive health program, including 
preventive medical care for bothe
students and faculty. The new 
full-time physician will also as
sist in making studies of food 
service and will develop precau
tionary programs to avoid hazards 
in. school research, operation, and 
construction.
Dr. Reed replaces Dr. Paul M. 
Rike, who has been part-time 
physician for Carnegie since 1943.
A native of Pennsylvania, Dr. 
Reed received his M. D. degree 
from the University of Pittsburgh
served his internship at the Pitt 
Medical Center. He served as a 
captain in the Army Medical 
Corps during the war and later 
engaged in private practice in 
Erie, Pa.
Student health is not a new

as student health physiican at 
New York State Teachers College 
and as a member of the student 
health department of Michigan

EditorialOpen Letter To Freshmen
Not Just Freshmen
To you, the Class of 1953, we do not offer advice; we offer 
a challenge.
We offer you the challenge of helping to make Carnegie 
Tech a school of spirit rather than an educational factory. We 
offer you the chance to become a class, organized and unified, 
the first since the war.
Daring the last year a member of Student Council came 
to the conclusion that this campus is full of dull thuds. It was 
at a time when school spirit was low, support for the athletic 
teams was practically non-existent, and all-school functions 
poorly attended. The situation improved considerably by the 
end of the year but it will revert unless you, the Class of 
1953, give your support.
The kind of support desired is a sincere enthusiasm for the 
school and for campus happenings. Get out and. cheer for the 
football team; join some activity and work together with 
your fellow students. This is also part of the education col
lege can give you.
There has always been a controversy about campus activi
ties and the advisability of joining them. We sincerely believe 
that a student who does not join some activity is missing much 
of the enjoyment and part of the education this school can 
give. There is no greater satisfaction than to see your writ
ing in print, your team win an important game, or your glee 
elub present a successful concert.
We have one warning to make, however. All campus ac
tivities, if taken seriously, take time and the freshman should 
assume extra-curricular duties gradually. Your primary ob
jective still should be academic achievement.
To facilitate your activity as a body, you will be pre
sented in the near future with an opportunity to institute a 
class organization with your own officers and voice in Student 
Council. Yours will be the first class so organized in many 
years if you accept the challenge. Along with the challenge is 
a responsibility to work together to revive the spirit on campus.
The opportunity of organizing into a class should not be 
ignored. The class organization will mean much 4o you in 
both your undergraduate and graduate life. During your un
dergraduate years it will provide a unified organization to 
sponsor all-school functions and the means of breaking the 
departmental barriers between the Class which arise because oi 
our educational organization.
After you have graduated the class organization will be
come the focal point of your contact with the school. Through 
the class organization, you will be able to keep a closer asso
ciation with the school and your classmates,
If you accept the challenge you will not be just fresh
men*; you will be the Class of 1953.

SC Approval
The Scot, Carnegies new va
riety magazine, needs only the ap
proval of the Student Council to 
start on its career as the replace
ment for the extinct Scottie. It 
has already been favorably re
viewed by the college publication 
committee.
Strictly a humor magazine, the 
old Scottie died last year when 
the staff rebelled against restric
ts imposed by a student censorMp committee and resigned en ma^
Definite Dians have been estab

ing to its edr^r Burt Wells, it 
will be somethin* new and dif
ferent in campus publications. The 
size will be oV2 by -iv2 inches, 
and the printing staff wil Mce off
set lithography. A reasonable 
estimate has been given as to the 
cost of publication.
A variety magazine, it will in
clude sports, humor, news, crea
tive writing, and will leature an

price will be the same as the 
Scottie.

members of the faculty and stu
dents.
During this period the Trustees, 
the administration, and the fac
ulty have cooperated in studying 
all aspects of Carnegies probj 
lems and plans for the future. As 
a consequence, sensible and efj 
fective policies have been agreed j 
upon and adapted. Thus, in spite | 
of the dislocations brought about 
by the war, Carnegies course has j 
been well charted and Carnegies i
progress has been continuous.
Helped Chart Course
As a member of the faculty 
and an administrative officer at 
t Carnegie, I have had a part in 
I charting our course; therefore, 1 j 
am glad to spy that I am in full j 
i sympathy with and eager to carj 
ry forward both C. I. T.s fundai mental program of education and i 
1 its present policy of balance 
umong fundamental research, 
graduate education, and under-1 
graduate education in the College 
of Engineering and Science, and 
between teaching and scholarly or 
artistic attainment in the College 
of Fine Arts, Margaret Morrison
Don't Push!
In an effort to speed up the 
handling of the expected stu
dent rush, the book store has 
set aside definite windows for 
freshmen and upperclassmen.
A counter will be set up at 
the gate to handle all fresh
men engineers; the center 
window will be used to serv
ice all Fine Arts students; 
and the main window is to 
be used for Maggie Murphs 
and upperclass engineers.
Students are advised not to 
buy miscellaneous items until 
after the first week or two. 
The usual lines cannot be 
avoided, but if everybody does 
his part the time spent in line 
will be greatly reduced.

Grateful to Trustees
I am especially grateful to the 
Trustees for making such arrange
ments that I will have the oppor
tunity of working with President 
Doherty for a full academic year 
before assuming the responsibili
ties of the presidency and, thus, 
learning from him, as far as I 
can, the things that have made 
his presidency so outstanding.
Dr. Doherty had this to say 
about Dr. Warners appointment.
Dr. J. C. Warner, whom the 
Board of Trustees announced as 
my successor in the office of 
President of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, is a man I have known 
and worked closely with for some 
thirteen years. Because of my in
timate knowledge of his admin
istrative ability stemming from 
his integrity, forthrightness, and 
sound judgment, i congratulate 
the Carnegie Institute of Technol

ership in the yearsjpa^ead.

Sportscope^
Gridders Look Toward 
First Victorious Season
Without blinking an eye the cautious Dr. Eddie Baker 
has predicted two Carnegie football victories for the coming 
season. If were lucky, he added. The gridders themselves, 
make no bones about their confidence in their own ability 
and readily predict an even split in the eight game schedule. 
Optimism is the key word everywhere but with the coaching 
staff where tradition, if nothing else, prevents such.
One cannot be other than wary, though, of the anti
cipation of these Tartan football stars. It is not easy to
forget the air of confidence which surrounded many of 
these same men last fall as they tackled Marrietta, Case, 
and Oberlin. Victory in every case seemed certain, yet it 
remained for heavily favored Grove City to provide an end 
to the long victory famine at Carnegie.
There was no question that a few breaks here and there 
would have turned the tide on several occasions, but the art 
of making their own breaks was noticeably missing in the
local squad. They just couldnt and wouldnt win.
There have been sweeping changes made since that wellremembered day of victory last November. Coaches, system, 
and players have been replaced and once again hope swells 
in Tartan hearts.
Despite the lack of depth in the current squad, we 
find it difficult not to share the optimistic spirit which pre
vails and along with the team look for four wins before 
Thanksgiving Day. Only Franklin & Marshall and Lehigh 
seem out of the upset range. The Scots could come out on 
the long end of the score in any of the other six contests.
* * *
Addition of the talented Moe Fassinger to the basketball 
coaching staff further brightens the outlook in that depart
ment. A greater star of yesteryear, he figures to give Mel 
Cratsley the support necessary to produce a winner. Rumors 
have it that the new staff will have the services of Tasso Katselas and Dave Ellies to atld to the yeterans of last year.* * *
Departmental shakeups which have left athletic director 
Buddy Overend now officially in charge of the intramural set
up do not figure to bring about many changes in last year's 
organizational program. Dave See continues as the working 
head of intramurals.* * #
New maroon and grey jerseys promise to add class to 
Pat OConnors soccer proteges. With practices scheduled to 
get underway shortly after September 21 the future for the 
local hooters is far from dim.
* * *
Tennis coach Frank Moses is taking a semesters leave
from his physical education classes to recuperate from a re
cent heart attack. Now on his feet with his doctors permission 
the veteran coach is resting at home.

Carnegie Tech rifle teams have 
come a long way in the past two 
years and hope to improve still 
further this coming season. The 
Plaid has risen from 33rd to 4th 
place in the senior units of the 
William Randolph Hearst compe
tition and from 56th to 5th place 
in the 2nd Arm^ Intercollegiate 
matches.
The rifle range is located in the 
sub-basement of Margaret Morri
son Carnegie College and the en
trance is directly off the football 
field.
Complete range* facilities are 
available for indoor target shoot
ing for .22 caliber rifles and hand
guns up to .45 caliber. Although 
riflery is the predominant sport on 
the range, those persons owning 
their own pistols and revolvers are 
free to use the range upon proper 
application and in accordance with 
the existing schedules.
The various rifle teams that are 
in existence at the present time 
are the varsity, ROTC, womens 
and freshman mens teams. These 
teams will soon begin practice and 
all students interested in trying 
out should apply at the range as 
soon as possible.
Former experience is not a re
quirement for application and 
anyone wishing to take advantage 
of a course in riflery that will be 
offered in the near fupture should 
attend a meeting to be held at the 
range on Friday, September 30, at

find many of the books they will 
need on sale at substantially re
duced prices.
A new three-way card filing 
system will speed up the move
ment of books by requiring a 
minimum of information for each 
book handled. Every owner will 
name his own selling price. For 
every book sold, APO will chan
nel 10 cents into its service fund.

Soccer Practice 
Opens Next Week 
For Tartan Team
As the new school year opens 
at Carnegie Tech, accompanied by 
the annual renewal of intercolle
giate athletics, soccer will be one 
of the first varsity sports to come 
into the limelight.
Although the soccer team has 
been depleted by the loss of such 
capable players as halfback Hart 
and De Moraes, last years star
new Tartan squad. With him has 
come Eddie Hirschberg, former 
Pitt line coach, who will assume 
similar duties here. The veteran 
A1 Irwin and Walter Burns will 
be on hand to offer further aid 
in the coaching duties.

With one victory, their first in 
six years, under their belt the ex
perienced Plaid team has high 
hopes of using Dr. Bakers split-T

be missing when the Techmen take 
the field at Bethany, West Virginia 
in the opener.
Captain Gerry Meyers and 
strapping Norm Keats returning 
for their third year as starting 
tackles will be hard to unseat from 
their positions. Hard hitting Floyd 
Wiseman and Larry Stovicek also 
seem certain to answer the open
ing whistle at their guard posts.
Some Posts Doubtful
End and center positions still 
remain in doubt, however, with 
Lou Fougere, Fritz Wilson and 
Bob Dougherty fighting it out for 
the terminal slots and Jim Trautman and Dean Kamaras seeking 
the center berth.
Bobby Sommers apparently has 
brought -an end to Dr. Bakers 
worries over the all important 
quarterback post. A hard runner 
with a strong passing arm, the 
ex-fullback showed well in spring 
drills and seems almost certain to 
get the call over place kicking 
Wes Kenney and freshman Jack 
Brourman.
Venerable Nick Simcic, already 
once winner of the Joe Pash Me
morial Trophy as the outstanding 
Tartan player of the year, will 
once again be number one running 
back. Pairing with him at right 
half will be fleet-footed Johnny 
Luchok.
Starting Backfield Set
Either Jack Magnifico, currently 
sidelined with an injured 
Tom Haney will round the 
starting backfield at tha^ullback 
slot.
The first gam&^rimmage since 
activities weu* resumed this fall 
presented a powerful front line 
squad wifh a decided change in 
the calibre of the replacements. 
Luchok promised to give oppos
ing defenses plenty of trouble dur
ing the next two months as he 
cut loose on two long touchdown 
gallops.
