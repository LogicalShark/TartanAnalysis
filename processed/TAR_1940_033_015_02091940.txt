After Seeing 
Rescued Son
Suffering from nervous -prostra
tion brought on by anxiety over 
the condition of his son who was 
lost in a New Hampshire blizzard, 
Dr. Webster N. Jones, Director of 
the College of Engineering, is in 
the Littleton Hospital, New 
Hampshire.
Having flown to New Hamp
shire immediately on hearing that 
a searching party had been organ
ized, Dr. Jones collapsed after his 
son was rescued on Sunday.- The 
young man, a sophomore at Harv
ard, had been lost for 28 hours in 
18-below-zero weather. It is hop
ed that the amputation of four 
frozen toes can be averted.
Mr. Jones had been on a skiing 
trip above the timber line of Mt. 
Washington in New Hampshire 
with a friend, Karl Sax. Saturday 
morning they became separated 
when a heavy blizzard forced 
them to abandon their trek to the 
summit of Mt. Washington, which 
is the highest mountain in that 
section.

Department of Drama Playwright 
Explains His No More Marriages
Based^ on an original one-act ? 
play written by himself a few 
years ago, Ed Hunts show, No 
More Marriages, will be the first 
production of the Department of 
Drama for the second semester.
A /-junior in the school, Mr. Hunt 
expanded his play into a full 
three-act drama, on the advitfe of 
the late Chester Wallace.
Ed, one of the few pi ay writing 
majors in the school, had been 
working on tho full play for five 
weeks before it assumed its final 
shape. The basic idea of the 
production is people never know 
what they want until they haven't 
got it any more. This is the 
first student-written production in 
a number of years.
Play Was Class Work
Ed, a Baltimore boy, worked 
with the Guild while he was down 
in his home -town. He continued 
his work in drama at Carnegie, 
and this fall appeared in a Pitts
burgh Playhouse production. The 
new play was a regular assign
ment for his play writing class, 
and was purely objective writing. 
While he was working on it, he 
had no actual idea of having the 
play produced.
He wants to act as well as write, 
but doesnt particularly care for 
acting in his own works. He be-? 
lieves, as^ do many famous play
wrights, that the actor can bring 
out much more than the writer, 
in portraying his own part.
Locale Is Biicks'County
The locale of the-play, actually 
in Bucks County, Was merely ar
bitrary. Ed < happened to pass 
through the district once. The 
original plan set the show in 
Paris and then New England be
fore the present idea evolved. It 
is a modern . farce concerning 
people in the theatre profession.
The play, which will open on 
February 16th, is being directed 
by Douglas McLean of the De
partment. The setting was de
signed by Cort Steen, a senior in 
the school.
Tech Debaters 
Enter Tourney
Carnegies Debating Team goes 
to Grove City College tomorrow 
to compete in its second tourna
ment of the year. The team is 
now arguing the Pi Kappa Delta 
(National Debate Fraternity) 
Isolation question.
A negative team consisting of 
Archer H. Beggs 40, and Robert 
H. McBride 42, lost an audience 
decision to representatives of 
Marquette University at the Third 
Presbyterian Church on Sunday 
with the Young Peoples Group as 
audience.
For the first semester the Car
negie debaters considered the 
question of responsibility for the 
present war in Europe. Their 
new proposition is: Resolved that 
the United States should follow a 
policy of strict (economic and 
military) isolation toward all na
tions outside the Western Hemis
phere engaged in armed interna
tional or civil conflict.
The teams schedule for this se
mester includes home debates 
i with well known colleges, and a 
trip that will cover a circuit of 
Ohio, New York, and Pennsyl
vania schools.

The Snow Queen was elected by 
the student body oh Wednesday, 
and no announcement has been or

Coronation. Despite rain, warm 
weather, and impending floods, the 
fenow idea is being carried out

2nd Semester 
Registration 
Shows Decline
Approximately 185 students 
gave up the struggle and dropped 
out of school during the first se
mester, figures compiled by Mr. 
i E. K. Collins, Recorder, reveal. 
While the ,figures are not final 
because of the possibility of late 
registratioris, some indication of 
the academic mortality rate can 
be observed.
Total enrollment is now 2,190 
as compared with 2,345 at the 
beginning of last semester. The 
loss from students who dropped 
out was offset by a gain of 34 new 
students who entered at second 
semester.
The freshman class suffered a 
reduction in numbers'" from 673 
to 633.
Due to the increased quota, 
however, the figures compare fav
orably ' with those of second se
mester of last year when only 2081 
returned of the 2,287 enrolled at 
first semester.
A slight decrease in the rate 
of mortality over last year is also 
indicated. The net decrease in en
rollment this year was 155. Last 
year it was 207.

Low Down Rhythm in a Top Ilat 
To Feature Donahue at Junior Prom
Good Evening, Ladies and 
Gentleman, that theme song Low 
Down Rhythm in a Top Hat in
troduces you to the music of A1 
Donahue and his orchestra with 
vocals by Paula Kelly and Phil 
Brito. Thats the greeting that 
will come from the Junior Prom 
at the Iiotel Schenley Ball Room 
on February 9 th.
A1 has been in the music field 
ever since his days at college 
when he took up a split course be
tween the law and the New Eng
land Conservatory of Music, and 
the music school won out. He be
gan playing for dances around 
Boston and then gradually got 
himself an orchestra and built 
up a reputation as a prominent 
stylist of the dance.
Society Band Leader, the title 
generally identified with Donahue 
probably evolved from the facl 
that he and his band have played 
all of the high class spots from 
New York to Florida and back 
by way of Bermuda. He has a 
great number of bands working 
under his name and playing on 
many of the boats going in all 
directions around the seven seas, 
but dont let it worry you, the one, 
the only, the original A1 Donahue 
will play the prom.
During the last, year, A1 ap
pearing for the seventh engage
ment at Radio Citys Rainbow 
Room, took a chance, and noticing 
the public change in musical 
taste, introduced swing to the 
formerly staid slcy-top spot in 
Manhattan. The result, Low 
Down Rhythm in a Top Hat was 
immediately acclaimed by the cli
entele of the Rainbow Room.
Besides taking the baton for 
the band, band leader Donahue 
is an accomplished violinist and 
often takes a turn at the vocals. 
Joining him in the singing field 
are pretty, popular Paula Kelly, 
who has built up a real reputation 
herself, and Phil Brito, whom A! 
acquired from Jan Savitt and his 
Top Hatters Orchestra.
Following his latest engage
ment at the Rainbow Room, AI 
made some stage appearances, 
featuring his vocalists and two 
instrumental soloists and come
dians, Charlie Carroll The 
Mickey Mouse of the Drums and 
Mickey Cielo, The Clown Prince 
of the Trumpet. After that he 
made a very successful appear
ance at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook, following Jimmy Dorsey, 
Glen Miller, and Larry Clinton 
into one of New Yorks most pop
ular out-of-town night spots. He 
comes to Pittsburgh directly front 
this latest success to play at the. 
Junior Prom.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9. 1940
Tartaii Starts Campaign 
To Buy Hook For Fairley
We have contributed to many causes during the past few 
years, but 001 cause lies as close to many of us as does the one 
we are about to broach.
All we need is a dollar or two to buy a book called And 
Sudden Death for presentation to Mr. George E. A. Fairley, 
Director of Public Safety of the.City of Pittsburgh.
All this concerns a little of the unfinished business of 
last semester. It started with a TARTAN editorial that called 
attention to the necessity of installing some safeguard at the 
corner of Forbes and Morewood to make the crossing of U. S. 
Highway 22-30 just a trifle less risky for campus pedestrians. 
At that time President Doherty contacted Mr. Fairley and called 
his attention to the hazard. v Mr. Fairley answered and promised 
to feed the problem to the Traffic Engineer of the Department 
of Safety. That was three months ago, and apparently the 
traffic Engineer is still cogitating.
It is for this reason that the TARTAN is opening its pres
ent campaign in prayerful hope that the grim And Sudden 
Death will awaken in the good Director a realization of the 
possible consequences of his continued neglect.
Please put your pennies in an envelope and place same in 
P. 0. Box 409, care of the TARTAN.
Editor Learns How to Lose 
Frfiensls and Alienate People
The concentrated indignation of those interested in the 
3uccess of the Junior Prom descended upon the editor of the 
TARTAN after an editorial on Tuesday which stated that all 
junior girls were not given an opportunity to be selected as 
Snow Queen.
Now, an editorial opinion (by identity) is an editorial 
opinion, but a mistake of fact requires retreat. So blow the 
bugles Prom Committee, for organizations other than sororities 
were contacted, and by this means other girls were given an 
opportunity to vie for the honor.
It seems that the Prom was a particular sore-spot, since 
Student Council had approved an expensive orchestra and 
would be compelled to make up for any deficit that lack of 
student support might cause. We hear that even Student 
Council members were selling tickets in an attempt to prevent 
a loss. As one young man said during a discussion in Council 
office, in which the editor acted as the individual versus so
ciety, This is something that really is on the level.
Of course, a mistake on the Snow Queen point does not 
nullify the editorial, nor was any refutation of its other points 
advanced. But, as we once stated, our attempt is not, nor will 
it be, to impose on the campus any hysterical campaigns on re
form in student politics, if such reform is apparently not wanted 
by the students.
In this and future years Council may expect criticism from 
these, columns, and this is to be expected. The amusing thing 
is'that when criticism is made, everyones fraternity brother 
takes it as a personal affront. Council is' probably the most 
sensitive spot on the campus.
There are times, as in the Snow Queen affair, when criticism 
is unjust, and no excuse can be offered. But we have a panacea 
for this, and we conclude with it as a suggestion: If, in future 
years, editors of the TARTAN are automatically members of 
Student Council, mistakes due to lack of accurate" information 
will not occur. The tendency to sit back and heave ill-founded 
criticism will be at a minimum. Many notions will disappear, 
since the mystery that surrounds them will disappear: Does
this sound reasonable?
At any rate, well see you at the Prom.

Will Address 
Public Forum
Oswald G. Villard 
Returns From Trip 
Abroad With News
Oswald Garrison Villard, emi
nent editQr, lecturer and publicist, 
will bring front-page news: 
fresh reports from Europe to 
the audience of the Pittsburgh 
Community Forum, Monday eve
ning, February 12. in the Schenley 
High School auditorium, at 8:15 
Mr. Villard, who is contribut
ing editor of the Nation, and its 
former editor-in-chief, is known 
to a vast public through his syndi
cated columins on international 
affairs.
At the end of August, 1939, Mr. 
Villard sailed for Europe, and was 
in England when war was de
clared. In October, he spent sever
al weeks in the Reich. He is one of 
the few American journalists who 
were inside Germany after the 
declaration of hostilities. In ad
dition, Mr. Villard visited the 
Hague and Prague, before return
ing home. His correspondence and 
comment were carried by many 
newspapers in the United States.
The leading librarians of the 
country selected as the outstand
ing autobiography of the first five 
months of 1939, Fighting Years, 
the story of Oswald Garrison Villards life and career, which was, 
in essence, more than a volume 
of reminiscence, but a chapter in 
American history, according to 
literary critic, Harry Hansen

CARNEGIE SHOOTERS OUT TO 
MAINTAIN ENVIABLE RECORD
 By DOC BURKE, Sports Editor .
Sergeant R. C. Sommer will present his 1940 rifle team to
morrow in a postal match with Gettysburg, Ohio State, Culver 
Military Academy, Wheaton College, and Oregon State.
Over a period of years the Sergeant has produced an un, usually high number of championship teams. Only last year 
his team compiled a brilliant record. Besides finishing second 
to Navy in the collegiate small bore championship, the team 
took second place in both the National Team Postal Champion.- 
ships and the Iiearst R.O.T.C. Matches.
The mainstays of last season's team were Harold Greene 
and Russell McMillen, both of whom are back this year. Greene 
was named on the All-American Team last June and McMillen 
was given a berth on the second group. These two shooters are 
well supported by veterans Pemberthy, Minton, and Whittum. 
Newcomers Reitz, Beck, Bowers, Horn, and Rathbun should 
keep the first five stepping to stay there. The last four are 
sophomores, which pleases the Sergeant no end.. The team 
was given a severe blow when Hudson of last years team 
dropped out of school.
Again this year the Tartans will have a crack Naval Acad
emy team with which to fight it out for the top spot in the na
tional rankings. The Middies have always been the team that 
has caused Carnegie the most trouble, and judging from the 
scores the Midshipment have been shooting, this year should 
not be an exception.
Even though the team has not been performing sensation
ally in their preliminaiy drills, Sergeant Sommer has a habit of 
"bringing the boys along fast as the season progresses. Dont be 
surprised if the Tartans are near the top of the heap at' the 
end of the year.
Notes From Our Scrapbook
Again this coming fall Carnegie Tech will be represented 
in the Eastern All-Stars Game in New York. Tiger Schmidt 
and Mertyn Condit have received invitations to play and have 
indicated they intend to accept. Incidentally, both of these 
fellows have been drafted for professional football, but as yet 
havent made up their minds.
Last year Ray Carnelly, Jack Lee, and Don Campbell ap
peared with the All-Stars who were under the tutelage of Jock 
Sutherland.
  # * #
In the Intramural Basketball league the PiKAs and the 
Citcom Clan are hotter than a four-alarm fire. Nothing short 
of a couple of broken legs will keep these teams out of the finals. 
Our money is on the former team.________________________________

Geneva Battles Quintet 
In Return Home Game
Veteran Rifle Team 
Begins Heavy Schedule
This Weeks 
Postal Match 
Concluded Wed.
Carnegie Techs varsity rifle 
team will conclude their postal 
match for -this week tomorrow. 
There are five teams participating 
in the match in addition to the 
Tech team, being Gettysburg, Ohio 
State, Culver Military Academy, 
Wheaton College, and Oregon 
State. The five best scores of the 
members of the team will be sent 
to the other schools and the win
ners determined from these. The 
mainstays of the team this year 
are Greene, McMillen, Minton, 
Penberthy, and Whittum. In addi
tion to these there are Reitz, a 
Junior, and Sophomores Beck, 
Bowers, Horn, and Rathbun.
Greene and McMillen have star
red consistently for the Tartan 
team since they have been in 
school and were named last year 
on the All-American Rifle Team. 
Greene won a ytrophy at army 
camp last summer and set a record 
at the Naval Academy of 390 for 
shoulder to shoulder shooting. 
Techs team was overshadowed 
only by the Naval Academy team 
which was undoubtedly one of 
the best inter-collegiate teams. So 
far the shooting has been mediocre, 
but much is expected of the cur
rent Tech rifle team.
1940 Football 
Card Arranged
Carnegie Techs football squad 
will open its 1940 season with 
Geneva at the Pitt Stadium, Sep
tember 28. On the following Sat
urday there is an open date which 
probably will not be filled.
The footballers will meet their 
first tough opponent, Holy Cross, 
in Worcester, Massachusetts on 
October 12; and will be away the 
next week also, tangling with the 
Irish at South Bend. The next 
game shows Case at the Stadium 
the next week, with Cincinnati be
ing met away on November 2. Aft
er meeting Pitt the next Saturday, 
the team will meet an undisclosed 
opponent, rest a week, and close 
with Duqusne on November 30.
Fencers Meet 
Duke Team
Instead of the regular Fresh
man basketball game that has 
served as a preliminary for the 
varsity encounter, Tech fans will 
get their first chance to see the 
Tartan fencing squad in action. 
The squad will perform as a 
preliminary to the Geneva battle 
on Saturday night.
Captain  Mario Monnachio, 
coach of the fencing forces, will 
first present a demonstration of 
fencing which will include all of 
the members of all of his classes. 
Following the drill, the members 
of the team will meet opposition 
from Duquesne and from Pitt in 
exhibition matches in the gym.
Those who will see action 
against the members of the other 
Pittsburgh school squad members 
will be Gary Lawrence, freshman 
music student; Andre Szoke, 
sophomore architect; Willard 
Scott, Art Hirsch, Sam Liff, Roily 
Kraus of the drama department, 
and Harvey Fichter of the En
gineering School.
Wrestling Is 
Not Supported
Despite the fact that Carnegie 
Tech has engaged one of the finest 
wrestling coaches in the state, 
this sport has not received a just 
response from the students.
Training periods are held by 
Coach Brown on Tuesday and 
Thursday evenings from 7:00 to 
9.00 and on Saturday afternoons 
from 3:00 to 5:00. Those who are 
interested in wrestling are urged 
to enroll immediately with the 
coach.
The excellent badminton and 
table tennis facilities of Thistle 
Hall are also not being adequate
ly used. Complete facilities for 
these sports are available on Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday from 
3:30 to 5:30, and on Saturday 
I .noi'ni-.gs i om 9:30 to 12:30.
Tall Tornado Squad 
Is Out for Revenge
Techs mighty Tartan five will 
try to gain their fourth win in 
11 starts when they tackle the 
Geneva College team on Saturday 
night in the home gym. Tech will 
be in full force with Stark, Holets, Sturgeon, Burch, Patton, and 
Tumpane all raring to go into ac
tion.
Tech is playing this match as 
the second half of a home-andhome series with the Golden Tor
nadoes. The first contest result
ed in a four-point victory for the 
Tartans with a 44 to 40 score. 
Since then, however the Genevans 
have started, to go up the ladder 
in the basketball world. They 
tripped Bethany and then went 
to White Plains County Center 
in New York to eke out a win 
over Brooklyn College by a 40 
to 39 score.
The team averages over 6-feet 
and is an all-veteran team. They 
are captained by Johnny Milanovich, a 6-foot, 2-inch guard who 
is seeking action for the third 
year on the squad. Backing him 
up is the other guard, Joe Harts
horn, at an even 6-feet, who is 
in his second year of playing for 
the Tornado. The center, and
scoring ace of the squad, is John 
Lillie who is averaging 13 points 
a game. He is another tall boy, 
going at 6-foot 2-inches and often 
has been seen in a forward slot 
on the squad.
Winters and Kidder at Forwards
The forwards are 6-foot 1-inch 
Ray Winters and the midget of 
the team, 5-foot 11-inch Harry 
Kidder. Their failure to hit the 
net with any great degree of con
sistency! can well be given as the 
Golden Tornadoes reason for 
dropping some of its early sea
son games.
They are coached by Edgar P. 
Weltner who had a brilliant bas
ketball and football career back 
in 1919. He coached high school 
ball and then for eight years was 
athletic director of the Goodyear 
Tire and Rubber Company. Welt
ner came to Geneva in 1937 and 
although his teams have yet to 
win a championship, his teams 
have always been able to give 
competent accounts of themselves.
Tech will undoubtedly have 
trouble with the Beaver Falls 
five, especially in the field of 
height. The Tech men haVe a 
number of small men on the 
floor, and Stark, Sturgeon, and 
Holets will really have to go all 
out to win.
Tech Skaters 
Defeat Fenn 
in Goalie Duel
Burleigh Scores 
Single Tally 
For Local Squad
On Tuesday night the Tech 
skaters eked out their second vic
tory over the Fenn College hockey 
team by a score of 1-0. It was a 
battle of goalies with Tartan Fred 
Feiler coming out ahead of Fenns 
Zimmerman, who was the only 
reason that the Skibos didnt 
register more counters.
With the exception of a low 
shot from deep in the corner by 
Art Burleigh for Techs lone tal
ly, Zimmerman turned away 
everything the Skibos had to of
fer.
Several times Bud Wilson, Vern 
Schilawslce, and Burleigh worked 
towards the Fenn cage and set up 
shots that none of - their mates 
could capitalize on.
Feiler was in great form and 
mre than the Fenn skaters could 
cope with. The addition of Bur
leigh to the front line made the 
offense stronger than it has been 
at any time this year.
This victory sent the Plaid to 
Cleveland to take on Case this 
Saturday with three wins and the 
same number of losses chalked 
up in the records. The Case squad 
is a strong outfit and should pro
vide another stiff test for the Skibo skaters who should, however, 
gain their fourth triumph.
Scrhbngs By Scratch
Id like to make one comment 
about the Freshman basketball 
team that faced a supposedly bet
ter Duquesne frosh five last Sat
urday and came off the victor. 
The boys, Sam Kaiser. Dave Brinn, 
Wally Patton, Whitey Mormon, 
and Hugh Smith, have really come 
up in their sports field, and 
should be a joy to Maxies heart 
in the next three years. On re
liable information I would like to 
comment that it was a group of 
five non-scholarship men from 
Tech that beat five scholarship 
players from Duquesne by a 43 
to 31 score.
It looks like Glen Cunningham 
did the right thing in announc
ing his retirement from the ac-' 
live track work after this years 
outdoor season. In his three starts 
in major races this winter he has 
yet to win. Chuck Fenske has 
beaten him twice and another old 
timer, Gene Venzke the other 
time. Venzke can last about one 
more indoor season, and Fenske 
will become the King of Milers 
for about two years. Two young
sters have yet to show their stuff 
in big -time competition and will 
have that chance all this winter; 
they are N. Y. U.s Freshman ace 
Leslie McMitchell and Southern 
Cals Louis Zamperin. The other 
man in the spotlight is the unI known factor, Blaine Rideout. 
These boys are presenting plenty 
of excitement this winter in the 
board track field.
One thing we are wondering 
about is how that picture hap
pened to get into the New York 
Times? What picture? Well, it
was one of Bill Lacey, 'the Du
quesne reserve center. How his 
picture happened to replace those 
of Widowitz, Becker, Milkovich, 
Debnar, and Kasperik is certainly 
a mystery in these quarters, for 
those five, who constituted the 
starting lineup in the Duke-Tech 
fracas turned in, much better per
formances than did Lacey.
It may be that local fans of 
baseball may get a good team this 
year with the Pirates and their 
new manager, Frankie Frisch. 
Frank can do a good managerial 
job, and if his lineup is good 
maybe the Techsters will see 
some good diamond playing this 
spring. With the boys down in 
winter training, and the McCoy 
episode over, maybe the field will 
settle down and work. Of course, 
that is if Judge Landis can settle 
down and talk turkey with the 
clubs and stop trying to be the 
Grand High Executioner and 
Over-Lord of baseball.

Freshmen Upset 
Favored Devils 
By 25-17 Count
Citcom Clnn and the PiKAs 
continued th<?ir drives toward 
their league championships by 
downing the Delta Sigma Club 
and the SAEs. The Clan soundly 
trounced the Delta Sigs by a 34- 
10 count, with Dick RuthraulT, 
league scoring ace, continuing his 
terrific pace. Ruthrauff split the 
cords with seven field goals and 
one foul shot to score 15 mark
ers and bring his pace-setting to
tal up to 45 points.
Walt Ellis proved the man of 
the hour for the PiKA cause 
when he went into the game and 
scored six points in the last few 
minutes to bring a 19-14 victory 
to the Morewood boys.
The Freshman Engineers upset 
the highly-touted Printers Devils 
by a 25-17 count. Previous to this 
fray the Devils had averaged 27 
points per game, but they seemed 
to have lost their scoring punch 
during exams, and, after jumping 
off to a 9-2 lead, they fell before 
the steady play of the Freshmen. 
Praft, of the Plebe squad, lead the 
scoring with 10 markers.
Other encounters saw the Betas 
bowing to the Phi Kaps by a 26-15 
score. Scobell Hall and the Metal
lurgists won their games when 
Miller and Welch forfeited.
Skibo Tankers Scuttle 
Swimmers from Wash-Jeff
Last Wednesday afternoon the4
Tartan splashers swamped the 
W&J mermen by the score of 44 
to 31. This victory, the second in 
the current campaign, was 
achieved despite the powerful 
swimming of the Prexy ace nator 
Tom Kramer. Kramer was suc
cessful in taking first in the 100 
yard dash, second in the 50 yard 
sprint event, and swam anchor po
sition on the winning relay team.
The high light of the meet was 
the 440 yard distance event, in 
which Harold Hirsch, of the Skibo 
aggregation, broke the Carnegie 
team record in this event. Harold 
bettered by four and a half seconds
previous record of 5:40.0 held 
Bob Vance.

A1 Katz and his Kittens were 
hired to play for the Mens Junior 
Prom held on Feb. 18, 1930. Mr. 
Katz had performed before the 
crowned heads of Europe and the 
Prom committee was fortunate in 
having obtained his services. The 
affair was held in the Schenley 
Hotel.
Those who were worried about 
transportation to the Junior Prom 
could set their fears aside. Kissel 
Shiles and Company were ready 
to rent new cars to students at 
extremely reasonable prices.
Westminsters powerful basket
ball machine beat the Tartans by 
a score of 29 to 20. It was be
lieved that the final examinations 
had interfered with the teams 
practice and had thus caused the 
defeat.
The Plebe Prom, otherwise 
known as All Fools Day, was to 
be presented by the freshmen on 
thev afternoon of Feb. 18. Each 
performer was required to wear a 
clown suit. The one appearing in 
the most unique costume as 
judged by the upper-classmen 
would be awarded a card grant
ing exemption from xall freshman 
regulations. This was indeed a 
privilege to be desired in these 
coarser, pre-humane days.
Henri Matisse, one of the most 
famous living artists and expon
ent of the moderne, was scheduled 
to visit Pittsburgh to serve on a 
committee of the 29th Carnegie

Student Considered 
For NBC Symphony
By Sylvia Slavkin
Neal DiBiase, Senior in the 
Department of Music, who is 
known as one of the finest trom
bonists in Pittsburgh, is being 
considered for a position in the 
far-famed N. B. C. Symphony un
der the direction of the noted 
Arturo Toscanini
At present Neal is first trom
bone player in the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra, a position he 
has held for three years. His 
teacher, Ottavio Ferraro, instruc
tor of trombone at Carnegie, was 
in the orchestra until this year, 
playing second tropbone.
Neal could have been in the 
N. B. C. Studio Orchestra last 
year if he had a New York union 
card. Although he had a Pitts
burgh union card, Local 60, it 
cant be used in any other city. 
In order not to be caught napping 
again, he went to New York last 
summer and after two months 
received his card. For the rest 
of the summer he toured the 
country with Buddy Rogers or
chestra. October found him in 
NeW Orleans and he very reluct
antly left the orchestra and came 
back to Pittsburgh where he has 
a contract with Mr. Reiner and 
the Pittsburgh Symphony.
It is no surprise to people who 
know Neal and his family that 
he has almost reached the top of 
his profession. His father was his 
first teacher. When Neal began 
playing the trombone at the age 
of seven he was much too small 
to reach the sixth and seventh po
sitions. Mr. DiBiase, unlike most 
striving fathers, decided to let 
time and nature take their course 
and didnt bother his son with 
music again for three years. Even 
today Neal has to stretch like 
mad to reach the seventh posi
tion.
When he was 14 Neal began to 
study with Mr. Ferraro and also 
became the first trombone player 
in the Carnegie Orchestra. He 
entered the Forensic League, a 
nation-wide contest for high 
school musicians, and won the 
county contest at Clairton, Pa., 
the sectional at California, Pa., 
the state at Oil City, Pa., and 
finally the national contest at 
Madison, Wisconsin.

The college man, of all classes, 
is perhaps the least adverse to

Most of the scarves are the soft

are solid colors available, but 
there are plaids and checks equal

You can prepare yourself for 
checks because they are going to 
be in with a bang by spring.
