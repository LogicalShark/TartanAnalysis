The report of Mr. Leeds, the Ath
letic treasurer, lays before the stu
dents our entire financial situation. 
The report also furnishes some sur
prises. At first glance it would seem 
that the foot-ball season had been our 
financial millstone, but on looking 
carefully we find such is not the case. 
Eliminating the Lehigh game and the 
matter of wages for the coach, two 
factors that, should not be counted 
against the teams finances, we see 
that the foot-ball association has been 
about even for the season. From 
where, then, does our deficit come? 
An amount by no means small was 
left from last year, and it of necessity 
was paid before incurring any obliga
tions for the present year. On our 
only game at home, where an admis
sion fee was charged, a very fair sum 
was realized, while at all of our outof-town games, as is usually the case, 
we lost money. The matter then re
solves itself into the proposition that 
one paying game at home will not 
clear the deficit caused by a season 
full of losing games away from home.
There are two things then that the 
student body must undertake: the 
first and most important take care 
of our deficit; the second take steps 
to prevent its occurrence next year.
In the matter of deficit the treasurer 
reported that the schools would take 
care of the Lehigh game deficit if
the student body would undertake to 
carry on athletics in a manner that 
will redound to the credit of the 
schools. Just what the Facultys ideas 
are on this subject is not obtainable 
at present, however we have reason 
to believe that they will not be un
reasonable. The remainder of the de
ficit is chargeable to salary for the 
coach and should not be charged to 
the foot-ball tam alone, as the coach 
was hired with <he understanding 
that he would serve for the entire 
year, thus only one-third of his salary 
is properly chargeable to foot-ball.
After plans have been made to meet 
these obligations there remains the 
problem of charging the deficits that 
the various other teams will undoubt
edly create into credit balances.
To the mind of the writer there is 
but one solution that can really be 
named a solution: It is to obtain pos
session of some inclosed grounds. 
The proposition to hold fewer games 
and those only inter-class affairs, only 
serves to reduce the balance on the 
wrong side to a minimum, not to 
eradicate it. The fact that the W. 
U. P. game cleared between two and 
three hundred dollars shows what 
could be done if we had grounds of 
our own.
The question then is how to obtain 
grounds, not next year or the year 
after, but now, so that the base-ball

need have no fear that either of the 
above departments will cause any 
trouble by adding to our already heavy 
burden.
Pittsburg, Pa., Dec. 3, 1907.
338 N. Craig Street. 
Director A. A. Hamerschlag:
Dear Sir: As chairman of the
Gypsy Encampment of the Juvenile 
Court Benefit at Exposition Hall, No
vember 21-22, on behalf of that char
ity, myself and aids desire to thank 
the students who so ably designed the

ous and well delivered music. They 
received much praise for their work.
Very truly yours,

Swarthmore Rejects Gift cf Three 
Million.
Swarthmore College has concluded 
to reject the $3,000,000 which Miss 
Anna Jeans, an eccentric Quakeress, 
recently offered to that institution, on 
the condition that it give up all inter
collegiate athletics, especially foot-ball. 
In considering this proposition, the 
trustees of Swarthmore found them
selves confronted by the question not 
only as to the advisability of restrict
ing the colleges liberty as to the use 
of the bequest, but, on the other hand 
as to the right of the present board 
of trustees to take such action as 
would bind succeeding boards. Pres
ident Swain and the directors an
swered these questions in the nega
tive. Before announcing his final de
cision, however, he consulted the 
presidents of 25 colleges, presenting 
these three inquiries: In your opin
ion, have the trustees of a college a 
right to bind for all time the institu
tion of learning by such restriction 
as the one mentioned? If so, should 
the gift be accepted in case it amounts 
to $1,000,000 or more? If the gift 
should be $50,000, what then?
President Elliot of Harvard, Presi
dent Wheeler of California, and Pres
ident Schurman of Cornell, and Presi
dent Judson of Chicago, answered all 
three questions in *he negative, while 
Columbia, Pennsylvania, Princeton 
and Michigan were non-committal on 
the first two propositions.
If the college agrees to give up in
ter-collegiate athletics for a certain 
sum of money, said President Swain, 
in summing up his reasons for refusal, 
why may it not agree to continue the 
inter-collegiate athletics forever for a 
certain sum of money? Why not 
agree to have or not to have forever 
military drill as a part of the college 
curriculum? If any body of trustees 
assumes to be wise enough to decide 
such a matter for all time, why not 
decide in a similar way the propriety 
of teaching or not teaching free sil
ver or the gold standard, the doctrine 
of materialism, or what not? *
A third freak organization has made 
its appearance within the last two 
weeks at the University of Indiana. 
The first was the Hiskin Thirteen,
the second was the Hobo Club, later 
called the Vagrant Club, because 
two members had been arrested and 
slated on the charge of vagrancy, 
while the third is the Pompadour 
Club. The purpose of this club is to 
encourage the old style of hair-cutting 
and to institute chapters in all other 
western universities.
To become a member, says Pres
ident Gorrell, one must hcve his hair 
cut in the approved style; no cow
licks will be allowed to matriculate. 
This is an exclusive organization.
Hereafter all examinations at Co
lumbia will be held in the University 
gymnasium, under the supervision of 
proctors especially detailed for that 
purpose. This action was resolved 
upon by the Columbia authorities on 
Wednesday.
The examinations until now have 
been held in separate rooms, under 
the supervision of the individual in
structors, and have resulted in much 
unfairness, it is said, because in some 
cases the persons in charge would 
maintain a strict watch over the stu
dents and in others there would be 
practically no supervision whatever.
The new system of holding the ex
amination in the gymnasium provides 
for absolutely equal treatment of all, 
and will undoubtedly do away with 
the present causes for complaint.
In three of the games in which the 
Carlisle Indians have played this fall, 
they have been watched by a total of 
more than 70,000 people.

NINETEEN ELEVEN
O.C*^O^O'OW'CH^m0 
A. F. Stamm, Editor.
One night last week the phone rang 
in the laboratory while B-2 was recit
ing. One of the wide awake (?) stu
dents yawned and growled, Turn that 
alarm off, its not time to get up.
The following show the various 
changes in a bulletin note put up by 
1912 after their victory over 1911 at 
football:
Whos all right? 1912. 
Whose all right? 1912. 
Whoses all right? 1912. 
Whos all right? 1912.
Whos all right? 1912.
From the number of attempts made 
to ask the question we are compelled 
to doubt very much the sentiment ex
pressed in the query. At any rate, 
English is not your forte, 1912.
MinisterBrother, you have been 
absent from services for a long time.
AbsenteeWell, reverend, you see 
I am like that fellow who stood afar 
off,' etc., only I stood so far off that 1 
did not get inside the door.
Overheard in B-2An old friend 
named his first born after me.
Is that so? Is he a boy or a girl?
For the benefit of a contributor to 
the TartanThere is no such verb as 
might of been, use instead might 
have been.
There has been some adverse criti
cism on the way things have been con
ducted in the class of 1911. There has 
been talk of a clique, cabal, or 
machine and the editor of this 
column has been advised to issue a 
statement on the subject.
Yes, there is a machine and every 
loyal student in the class should re
joice in its activity. The existence of 
a machine is not an entirely unheard 
of thing in politics, whether national, 
local, or class, and the fact is to be 
deplored that the influences of  such 
combinations is usually bad. However, 
the clique cr machine in 1911 is 
nothing more nor less than a combina
tion of the loyal members whose one
idea is to promote goodfellowship 
with all classmates and to whom the 
addition of new names to the growing 
list is a pleasure of infinite magni
tude. The clique extends an invita
tion to each and every member of 11 
to come out and to identify himself 
with the main body of the class in 
making class affairs, meetings and 
athletic contests successful. One of 
the main causes of the defeat of our 
team was the absence of rooters. Let 
the miserable affair of Thanksgiving 
morning be a lesson in loyalty to the 
members who chose rather to sleep 
than to get up and root for the blue 
and white.
The committee which waited upon 
1912, in extending an invitation to the 
smoker, December 20, are loud in their 
praises of the reception accorded 
them at the hands of 1912.
An explanation is due the readers of 
the Tartan for the measly write
up of the 1912-11 football game. The 
facts in the case were these:
1912 objected to Mr. Stamms writ
ing it on the grounds that he might 
not give the victors a square deal as 
he is an eleven man. So they fussed 
around trying to find a man to do the 
stunt and the poor write-up is the re
sult of everybody waiting for another 
to do it.
(1912 does not wish to be misunder
stood in this matter as theie was no 
reflection upon Mr. Stamms veracity 
intended, but rather, they thought, 
To the victor belongs the spoils.)
How strange that childrens stories 
were found on the 1912 page in a re
cent issue of the Tartan! Perhaps 
not any more so than appropriate.
The resignation of Miller from the 
social committee of 1911, was the oc
casion of a slight hitch in the arrange
ments for the smoker. His action in 
leaving his fellow committeemen in 
a hole is generally condemned but 
we have no doubt that he had good 
reason for his action. Mr. Glasser, 
of B-2, was appointed to succeed him.
A suggestion has been made that 
chocolates be furnished those who 
dont smoke at the smoker, December 
20. Nothing doing, but come whether 
you smoke or not, there will be a good 
time in it for every one.

The exhibition given by the Boston 
Normal School graduates, and their 
pupils, last Tuesday night, was an in
teresting demonstration of gymnastic 
work. The program consisted of
1. Couple dancing by the pupils from 
A. P. S., Stewart-Mitchell School, 
P. C. W. and M. M. C. S.
2. Swedish gymnastics, by graduates 
of B. N. S. G. and pupils.
3. Vaulting box and horseby Boys

4. Gamesby Pupils of Schools.
5. Classic dancingby the graduates.
6. Basketball.
The three couple dances, Eloise 
Gavotte, Bolero and Dolly Dollars 
were very pretty, especially the last.
The smallest boy in the class won 
applause every time he \aulted the 
box from end to end, a feat many of 
the larger boys could not do.
The classic dancing, however, was 
the feature of the evening, especially 
Cupids Dance led by Miss Stoner. It 
was encored till the graduates came 
out and danced it again. We hope the 
graduates were as successful financial
ly in their efforts to help the Mary

PLEBES 1910.
Lowell W. Nicols, Editor.
The first day the present class spent 
in the school ended in a meeting in 
the Assembly Hall. The Director and 
Mr. Sampson, of the Senior class, 
spoke, and it will be remembered, 
emphasized the necessity of getting 
together. Our class officers have 
worked hard to accomplish this; our 
friends, the Juniors, have added their 
mite to the cause, but after all, have 
we succeeded? You think so. On 
your way to school to-morrow morn
ing see how many of the fellows in 
the class you can call'by name. When 
you get into the lecture hall,, have an
other look. Of course you know the 
ones in your own section, and about 
half of those in your companion sec
tion, but outside of the class officers 
and the fellow beside you, how many 
can you name? Faces familiar 
enough, but oh, my, the names! Pe
culiar thing, isnt it, the way they slip 
your memory? I have been at it a 
week now, and every morning have 
discovered at least one I would have 
sworn I never saw before. The thing 
will work itself out in time no doubt, 
but if left entirely to itself will take 
its own time in which to do the work.
Who said anything about a class 
basket-ball team? The weather in 
Pittsburg is such an undependable 
quantity, that outdoor hockey cannot 
be depended upon for any length of 
time, if at all. Very few school teams 
in our vicinity have a place to play, 
and it would hardly be likely that 
enough games . could be arranged at 
the Gardens to fill up any kind of a 
schedule. This leaves basket-ball for 
our consideration. Which would yon 
rather do while playing a game, hur
dle brick piles and mortar boards in 
the lunch room annex, or iump moulds 
and dodge Mr. Dosey in tie Foundry?
There are enough good players to get 
up a splendid team, and all that re
mains is to get the place to play.
Mr. H. T. Ashe, who had the honor 
of filling the office of temporary pres
ident of the Class of 1910, has left the 
school to take up work in a Theologi
cal Seminary. He had made himself 
popular with his classmates and will 
be missed by all.

there were songs, recitations and a

Woolensack. Mr. White covered him
self with glory by the way he dis
pensed refreshments. The entire af
fair was conducted in a spirit of good 
fellowship, such as is rarely seen in 
any class gathering. Mr. Otterson is 
to be congratulated for his share in 
promoting the pleasant evening which 
all enjoyed.

ATHLETIC BOARD MEETS.
The Athletic Board of the schools 
met last Friday evening with all but 
one of the representatives in attend
ance. The unfamiliarity of most of 
the men with the situation precluded 
any very decisive' action. The board 
organized with Colmery as chairman 
and Frampton, secretary. After some 
discussion a committee on constitu
tion was elected with Brown as chair
man. The treasurer, Mr. Leeds, then 
rendered his report and a committee 
with Mr. Woodward as chairman, was 
elected to audit his books.

It seems to me that the association 
members should face the condition 
which exists, that is, that we have no 
funds in hand to meet obligations al
ready incurred, amounting to over a 
thousand dollars, and that the base
ball, basket-ball, hockey and track 
teams are absolutely unprovided for. 
It is imperative, therefore, first, that 
provision be made to meet outstanding 
debts, and second, that no further ob
ligations be incurred until we are 
financially able to meet them.
A budget should be prepared for 
the remainder of the year and man
agers of different teams should be 
instructed not to exceed the amount 
assigned to a given sport.
I should suggest that a committee 
be appointed to audit the treasurers 
accounts so that the association mem
bers may know how their funds have 
been expended.

In the report of the secretary and 
treasurer of Princeton Athletic Asso
ciation a deficit is shown in every 
branch of athletics except base-ball, 
the greatest being in track athletics. 
The report, however, does not include 
foot-ball, which was published sepa
rately last fall.
We believe that the trip of the foot
ball team to Pittsburg was one of the 
best things that has happened for Le
high in a long time, and therefore 
wish to express the appreciation of 
the college to those whose efforts 
helped to make the game with Carne
gie Tech a possibility. A healthy ri
valry has been established between 
the two institutions that should lead 
to other contests in the futures.Le

Peebles Leads in Beauty Contest.
The votes are coming in rather 
slowly in the beauty contest, consid
ering what a lot of promising candi
dates for that upright grand square 
piano there are in school. The girls 
are suspected of playing favorites 
very heavily in this contest, and Pee
bles undoubtedly owes his lead to the 
enthusiastic support of our fair friends 
across the campus.
Only one night student has appear
ed in the contest, but he is well up 
among the leaders. We hope his 
friends will come out stronger in his 
behalf this week and give the night 
school a chance to show what they 
have in their midst.
The following is a list of the candi
dates and their standing:

The class of 1912 held a meeting on 
last Friday evening, at which nearly 
the entire class were in attendance.
The Constitution and By-Laws were 
read but no decision could be reached 
owing to the lateness of the hour.Ifc;It can be said that the class is mak
ing rapid progress, and by the first of 
the year 1912 will be well organized. 
No doubt there was a kind feeling, 
and a .many hand shake to those who 
participated in defeating 1911 football 
team. And all through the meeting 
football among the members of the 
team was the whole discussion.
The choice for captaincy of the 1912 
football team lies between Newell and 
McGovern.

Concrete Foundations.
The following is a method of build
ing machinery foundations out of con
crete used by the Ingersoll-Rand Co.
Concrete work, if good, is not more 
costly than brick, and is to be prefer
red where gravel or broken stone and 
good cement can be obtained. Stone 
must be broken fine enough to pass 
through a two inch ring. The proper 
proportions are five (5) parts of 
broken stone or gravel, two and onehalf (2Vz) parts sand, and one (1) 
part first class Portland cement, 
Alpha, Medusa, or other high grade 
makes. These proportions are to 
measure. A barrel of cement weighs 
380 lbs. net, and will make 21 cubic 
feet of concrete in the above mixture. 
Mix cement and sand dry, then 
moisten to consistency of a paste, not 
too thin, wet the stone or gravel 
thoroughly, then mix with the mortar 
by shoveling. This should be laid in 
layers of about 8 inches, mauling or 
tamping thoroughly until the water 
shows, but be careful not to use too 
much water. In large foundations the 
work must be carried on night and 
day until completed.
In cold weather have sand and 
(stone thoroughly warm and dry, then 
| use warm water and cover thickly 
with straw until thoroughly set. Ceiment must always be used within one 
hour after mixing, preferably within 
one-half hour. Never use cement 
which sets within one half hour, nor 
re-tamper cement not used promptly.
When a foundation must be built 
or soft ground or on sand or loose 
gravel, or must be carried up through 
a basement or cellar, it should be 
large at the base. All the conditions 
must be carefully considered, and 
good judgment exercised by the super
intending engineer.
For roughly estimating the Gost of 
foundations the following data may 
be used, proper allowance being made 
for location* cost of labor and ma
terial. kind of soil, etc.:
Excavation in earth, per cub. yd..$ .30
Concrete (Hydraulic Cement) per
cubic yard .................................6.00
Concrete (Portland Cement) per
cubic yard ..................................7.00
Hard brick laid in hydraulic
cement (per 1000) .................15 00
Hard brick laid in Portland cement
(per 1000) ..................................17.00
Stone laid in hydraulic cement
(per perch of 16% cu. ft.)... 4.50 
Each 1,000 brick will require 2% 
barrels of cement and one cubic yard 
of sand. Bricks with about *4 mortai 
joints runs about 21 to the cubic foot. 
Do not use cheap hydraulic or other 
grades of cement and expect good re
sults in foundations. A good mason 
will lay from 1,800 to 2,000 brick per 
day. Allow foundations to dry from 
one to four weeks before machine is 
set, depending on the size and on the 
season of the year.

L. C. Frank was chosen as repre
sentative of Class 1910 in the Athletic 
Association.
It is surprising to note how much 
more some one student will know 
more about certain subjects than the 
balance of the class, and sometimes 
the instructors, yet when the average 
is taken at the end of the year, how 
far below the average of the class this 
student has fallen.
Demonstrations of knowing how, 
by certain students, are often dis
played in the class room but out of 
them, this knowledge falls to zero, 
when they are asked for enlighten
ment on some problem.
Better let the instructors preform 
their own duties, and the rest of the 
class will get a better idea of what 
is being taught and be better inforihed as to the subject in question.
At last our money has been found 
to be real. The Tartan can be bought 
now each week either on Thursday or 
Friday nights.
What was wrong with Dibble recent
ly? He provided amusement for all 
in trigonometry on a certain night 
which was well received. Thought he 
was on the water-wagon!
The suggestions to Plebes which 
appeared in last weeks issue were 
well written and contained good sound 
advice. 1911 would profit if some or 
all of the suggestions were studied 
and followed. **
It is earnestly requested that all 
who care to listen to the rehearsals 
of the Mandolin club, will refrain 
from offering their advice as to what 
music the club should play. Our di
rector is fully competent to select the 
pieces and is better informed as to 
the club's abilities. On a recent re
hearsal night there were probably 50 
pieces, more or less, suggested from 
students present, with the assurance 
that each one would make a hit. Valu
able time is taken up by interruptions 
of this sort, and for the good of the 
club, the director requests that any 
advice or suggestion be forwarded 
him by letter.
The time at which practice for 
basketball is held for the Varsity 
team, effectually bars out the night 
students. This is not good policy, for 
there are just as good and experienc
ed players in the night schools as in 
the day, and the time selected for 
practice should be such as to allow 
the night men to get out. The night 
representatives in the Athletic As
sociation, would do well to look into 
this question and have the time for 
practice fixed later in the evening.
The fear of 1911 expressed in last 
weeks issue, to be taken for old 
fossils, is entirely groundless. 1911 
is too green to be taken for anything 
except that which they are, raw, un
couth and overgrown boys, not pro
ducts of real humanity; they simply 
grew, like Topsy, and under a good 
strong sun, would wither and become 
extinct. The sun in this case could be 
either a stiff monthly test in any of 
their studies, or, a comparison of 
merits with their betters Class of 
1910.
Walter Pfeil entertained the Cru
cible Club in a most elaborate manner 
last Thursday evening. The evening 
was spent in talking shop, and at 
10.30 a most toothsome dinner was 
served, after which the boys left for 
their homes.

he is discovered. To avert this ca
lamity a small house will be erected 
in the middle of the structure.

A committee from the National 
Paint Association requested that they 
be given permission to carry on a se
ries of experiments under the aus
pices of the school authorities. They 
were interviewed by Director Hamerschlag, who expressed his lively in
terest in the proposition and at once 
appointed the following committee to 
confer with the members of the asso
ciation:
Dr. James, chairman; Prof. Gibbs, 
Mr. Phillips, Mr. Foss, and an ap
pointee of Mr. Geisey.
The association desires to make 
tests on the durability of paints, using 
various oils, white leads, etc. The 
plan is to erect a fence facing east 
and west on the school property 
about 150 feet long and six feet high, 
containing 100 panels 18 inches wide. 
On these panels will be painted every 
combination of mixture that the asso
ciation deems important to test. 
These panels are to be examined each 
year for five years under the super
vision of a committee from the Tech
nical Schools.------o------

Senior Mechanicals Make a Tour of 
Inspection.
Last Thursday afternoon the Senior 
Mechanicals accompanied by Prof. 
Trinks and Messrs. Pilkington and 
Jones made a trip to McKees Rocks 
to visit the plant of the Pressed Steel 
Car Co., and of the Pennsylvania Mal
leable Co. The trip was rather a 
hurried one, but the students saw 
much to interest and instruct them. 
The mill machinery students were in
terested specially in the large punches 
and shears and hydraulic presses used 
by the Car Co. for working the steel 
plates used in construction of the cars.
The power plant of this company 
contains a Westinghouse-Parsons 
steam turbine and turbo-generator, 
and a Curtis vertical steam turbine 
and generator. The two machines 
were both running and are set close 
to each other so toat a good oppor
tunity for comparison of the operation 
points of each was given the 
students. The method of finishing car 
axles by means of a small roller held 
in the lathe tool post was noted, as 
well as the hydraulic press used for 
forcing the wheels on the axles.
The Pennsylvania Malleable Co. 
makes a specialty of chilled car 
wheels and small malleable castings. 
The students inspected the annealing 
ovens and saw the process from be
ginning to end. The car wheel ma
chine was another interesting feature 
of this plant. It consists of an endless 
chain of mould cars carrying the 
molds around successively from the 
moulding floor to the casting ladle and 
back again to take up the process 
once more.
The trip was finished by a short 
voyage on the steamer Steel Queen up 
to Allegheny.

The University of Kansas has es
tablished a publicity bureau. Several 
seniors have been detailed to prepare 
regular correspondence for the daily 
papers of Kansas.
The lightest man on Michigans 
team is 165 and on the squad of 20 
men who include the regulars and sub
stitutes, there are only three men 
under 170, and these all weigh 165 
even.
Reversing Steam Turbines.
An improvement in reversing tur
bines has been patented in Germany. 
The invention is for the purpose of 
keeping the steam always at normal 
pressure in the boiler, for both the 
forward and reverse movements, and 
also in the position of always having 
the pressure for reversing equal to 
that for forward traveling and of 
maintaining it at the same height for 
cruising speed. The forward turbine 
consists of a high-pressure and lowpressure turbine which act on a single 
shaft. By means of a three-way cock 
steam may be admitted either through 
the pipe and ports to the high-pres
sure turbine or through the pipe and 
ports to the revert*.ig turbine. The 
reversing turbine is connected, as is 
the low-pressure turbine, by a pipe 
with a condenser, and is also provided 
with means for regulating the partial 
flow of the steam by means of a num
ber of valves which serve the separate 
nozzles of the guide channel in the 
ordinary way. The inventor claims 
that a great ocean liner can be built 
to travel as fast as the British turbine 
torpedo boat which made 35 knots an 
hour, but it is doubtful whether the 
consumption of coal to attain such a 
speed, under present conditions, would 
not be so great as to render this im
practicable.^Consular Reports.

Every year at Yale the Seniors vote 
on the question of chapel, and it is 
invariably decided that the daily 
chapel exercises shall be continued, 
and that attendance at chapel shall 
be compulsory.
New York University requires every 
student to attend daily prayers ex
cept those who elect as an alterna
tive the duty of writing an essay 
every two weeks on some moral or re
ligious subject.
Yale has received a bequest of 
$150,000 from Mrs. James B. Oliver 
of Pittsburg for erecting a memorial 
building to her son, D. Leet Oliver, 
08, who was killed in an automobile 
accident last June.

A Large Engine.
What is said to be the largest 
tandem-compound steam engine ever 
built was recently completed for the 
Carnegie Steel Co.'s plant at Youngs
town, O., by the Wm. Tod Co., of. that 
city. The engine is of the horizontal 
type, weighs 500 .tons, with cylinder 
diameters 52 and 90 inches, and 60 
inches stroke, and operates at 58 r. 
p. m. The horse power range is from
4.000 to 7,000. The flywheel weighs
240.000 pounds, and the main journals 
are 30 by 58 inches, while the shaft is 
36 inches diameter in the center, and 
the crankpin 20 by 16 inches.

Princeton is to have a new fire-proof 
physical laboratory, the gift of S. S. 
Palmer, an alumnus. The building 
will be of ornamental brick, with 
granite trimmings, and will cost 
$350,000.------o------
New Dormitory.
The prospect is aright for the ac
quisition of a large up-to-date house 
within very short distance of the 
schools which will be used as a dormi
tory if a sufficiently large number of 
students are interested. See Mr. 
Field.

Two scholarships for American 
women are being offered by the En
glish Universities corresponding to 
the Rhodes scholarships for men. 
Each scholarship entitles the holder 
to 300 pounds per year, and is won 
by taking the Rhodes examinations in 
Latin, Greek and Mathematics.

Heat Losses Due to Boiler Scale.
At ithe engineering experiment sta
tion of the University of Illinois an 
exhaustive series of tests on boiler 
tubes has been conducted during the 
past few years to determine the rela
tion between the heat loss due to the 
scale and the thickness of that scale. 
The experiments and their results are 
reproduced in full in the University 
Bulletin No. 11.
The experiments as recorded are 
shown to have included tests upon 
single 'tubes as well as upon the en
tire boiler. The results of all the 
tests, referred to scale thickness as a 
basis, show wide divergence in the 
heat losses, the variation being ascrib
ed to differences in scale structure. 
This feature of scale structure, there
fore, is of greater importance than has 
commonly been realized heretofore.
The conclusions derived from the 
tests are summarized as follows:
1. That for scale of thicknesses up 
to Vs in., the heat loss may vary in 
individual cases from insignificant 
amounts to as much as 10 or 12 per 
cent.
2. That the heat loss does increase 
with thickness in an undetermined 
ratio.
3. That mechanical structure of 
the scale is of as much or more im
portance than thickness in producing 
this loss.
4. That chemical composition, ex
cept in so far as it affects the struc
ture of the scale, has no direct influ
ence on heat transmission.Power &
