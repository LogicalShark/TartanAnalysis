NOTED SPEAKERS ADDRESS STUDENTS AT THIRD LIBERTY LOAN ASSEMBLY
J. M. DeBeaufort and Sari 
Engstromer Speak on War 
Conditions
MRS. CLEMSON SINGS
On Tuesday morning a general as
sembly of the four schools was held 
in the Carnegie Music Hall, where the 
main subject of discussion had to do 
-with the Third Liberty Loan. The 
students fell in in battalion formation 
on the campus, the companies in al
phabetical order and marched down 
to .the institute, making a very good 
showingquite a contrast to the timehonored pee-rade which used to 
snake down oyer Schenley Bridge.
Mr. Tarbell, acting president of the 
school, opened the assembly by mak
ing a short address in which he out
lined the purpose of the meeting. 
There were two definite objects in 
view in calling it at this time he said: 
Our observance of the first anniver
sary of Americas entrance into the 
war, and to celebrate the launching of 
the Third Liberty Loan Drive at 
Tech.
Dean Breed of Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School was then introduced 
as presiding officer of the . day, in 
recognition of her efforts in forming 
the Womens Defense League which 
is doing such good work in the inter
ests of the Liberty Bond Campaign in 
this city.
Mrs. Hamerschlag, wife of the Presi
dent of the school, made an announce-- 
ment. concerning the Military Ball to 
be held at the Schenley Hotel on 
April 19. The Red Cross expects to 
realize quite an. amount from this 
affair, and can easily do so if every 
one turns out as ire should. She also 
announced that the Design student 
body had given seventy-five dollars 
to the auxiliary, and Mrs. Johnson 
had donated twenty-five dollars addi
tional.
Dean Breed then introduced Miss 
Sari Engstromer, who has been in 
charge of the medical massage depart
ment in Relief work in France until 
a short time ago, when she had to dis1- 
continue active service for a time on 
account of threatened physical break
down. Miss Engstromer studied both 
in Sweden and England, and although 
she is quite modest, one soon realizes 
the capability] which 'underlies liter 
charming personal appearance. She 
spoke at length and very interestingly 
of instances related to her work, and

RICHARD MANSFIELD D 
DIES AT TEXAS CAMP
The announcement of the death of 
Richard Mansfield II, at Camp Upton, 
last Thursday came as a great shock 
to the entire faculty and student body 
of Tech, and more especially to those 
of the School of Applied Design, 
where he was a student during the 
greater part of the last two years. 
Every one knew Richard and although 
his reserve held him aloof from the 
greater number of his ..classmates, 
those who knew him well have noth
ing but praise for his sincerity and 
vitality, which made all his work 
Stand out as creative art.
His death seems all the greater 
loss, since so many hopes for the fu
ture are blasted by it. He was still 
only a boy, and who can tell to what 
great heights the son of such a father 
might have attained had he grown to 
maturity. Despite his many youthful 
eccentricities, the spark of genius 
was apparent in his work, and had 
he lived he might well have become 
truly great.
Outside of the college itself, Richard 
had many friends in the city, where he 
and his mother were well-known; and 
all join in expressing their sympathy 
for her who will feel most deeply the 
loss of one for whom she hoped so 
much.
BAGPIPE WAR ISSUE 
CONTAINS HONOR ROLL
The editors of the Bagpipe are mak
ing rapid progress with the War Num
ber of that publication and expect to 
have the same ready for distribution 
the early part of next week. Accord
ing to the editors this is going to be 
one of the best and most interesting 
issues put out for some time. The 
principal feature of this number will 
be the Honor Roll, which contains the 
-name, rank, date of enlistment, and 
present location of the stude.nts of 
Applied Industries who have left 
school since the beginning of the war. 
Another feature will be a large picture 
of Company D, letters and other in
teresting information will also be 
found in the War Number.
Copies of the number will be sent 
to each of the fellows in the service.
FIRST R. O.T. C. REVIEW 
DRILL GENERALLY GOOD
Tech was reviewed as an R. O. T. C. 
for the first time on Thursday, April 4. 
Parade was formed at 8:50 and con
sisted of the Tech companies headed 
by the band.
The actual review was held on Flag
staff hill, the reviewing officers were 
stationed on a knoll and the companies 
in a column of platoons* marched past. 
Later the companies were formed Into 
a battalion front and the reviewing 
officers inspected each rank separate
ly.
The drill was very well executed 
and a smart air of sAvank characteriz
ed the battalion as a whole. The com
panies were dismissed at about nine 
forty-five.
COL. BROOKS BROTHER 
IS KILLED IN FRANCE
Colonel Brooks last week received 
a telegram from the War Depart
ment notifying him of the death of 
his brother, Captain Henry W. 
Brooks, who was serving in the 
American Expeditionary Force in 
France.
Captain Brooks graduated from 
Cornell in 18S7 as an electrical en
gineer. 1-Ie specialized in electric 
railroad construction and was a 
member of the Engineers Society in 
Chicago. Captain Brooks offered his 
services when war was first declared 
and was sent to Camp Thomas, Chilicothe, Ohio. He had the distinction 
of being the only man in camp who 
was picked by name for overseas 
duty.
He sailed for France last fall, and 
since then he has seen continuous 
active service.
Captain Brooks leaves a wife in 
Chicago. He was the only brother, 
of Colonel Brooks. His father was 
Admiral Brooks, U. S. N., who serv
ed under Farragut during the Civil 
War.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT IN 
SERVICE OF GOVERNMENT
Tech students who wisn to secure 
summer employment are requested 
to call at the Bureau of Recommen
dations for information. The de
mand for technically trained men is 
very heavy, at the presenttime, and 
the office is receiving inquiries daily 
from private firms and various de^ 
partments of the Government rela
tive to the availability of students 
for summer work.
The particular call at present is 
from the Federal Board for Vocation
al Education who want men for five 
months work in (1) the Bureau of 
Standards, (2) the Reclamation Serv
ice, (3) the Geological purvey and 
(4) the Ordnance Department. In 
some of the services it is possible 
that particularly well qualified men 
may be desired for the period of the 
war, receiving military status and 
being assigned to special war work.
(Continued on Page Four.)
DEST MEN FOR CAMPS; 
ALL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE
As the Tartan was going to press 
word was received that the summer 
camp is definite. Men selected will 
be paid at the same rate at which a 
private is paid, and if they are of 
draft age they will be commissioned 
upon the completion of the course. 
Men will be selected for the camp up
on the amount of work they have tak
en, and the exam they take on that 
work.
Colonel Brooks announced early 
this week that a limited number of 
students will be selected to be sent to 
an O. T. C. for summer training. Those 
men showing the most aptitude for 
military work will be chosen, regard(Continued on Page Two.)
TAU BETA PI ELECTS 
THREE SCIENCE JUNIORS
The local chapter of the Tau Beta 
Pi Association announces its selec
tions from the upper eighth of the 
Junior Class as follows: H. H. Blau,
E. Y. Davidson, H. D. Krummel. The 
three men elected were qualified both 
from the standpoint of scholarship 
and activities. Tau Beta Pi requires 
its candidates to be in the upper quar
ter of their class at, the beginning of 
the Senior year, or in the upper eighth 
at the middle of the Junior year; the 
men selected were of the latter group. 
They must also be of the type who 
have engaged in activities to the best 
of their ability during their time In 
college.
H. H. Blau is a Junior Chemist. He 
has been Athletic Editor of The Tar
tan during the past year, and was 
elected as one of the Science repre
sentatives on the Thistle board where 
he lias held the same position. I-Ie 
is at present secretary of the Junior 
class, and lias been working to keep 
up the Chemists Club of which lie Is 
also secretary. He has managed to 
survive towards the end in several of

MEN ENTERING SERVICE 
MAY TAKE SPECIAL WORK
In connection with military work, 
Col. Brooks1 said Monday, that any 
man contemplating entering the serv
ice will have the oportunlty of pre
paring himself for the branch of serv
ice lie selects. However, the choice 
of the branch must be sanctioned by 
the military authorities at Tech be
fore the chooser may take special 
training. In this1 way, men entering 
service will have advantages over 
others and will possibly be able to get 
noncom jobs.

COMMITTEE PRACTICALLY COMPLETES DETAILS OF FORMAL MILITARY BALL
The first shipment of military para
phernalia arrived at Tech on Sat
urday when complete equipment for 
trench digging arrived. Trenches will 
be dug as soon as the weather will 
allow. These trenches will be dug on 
the fill between Forbes street and 
Tech.
Not only will trenches be dug, stud
ied and completely fitted, but also will 
they be destroyed. With the assign
ment of trench digging material came 
a number of explosive bombs which 
will be used against the trenches. In 
this way the theories and practices 
of actual trench warfare will be 
taught.
Rifles and bayonets are expected to 
arrive at Tech next week and bayonet 
practice and rifle work will be start
ed at once. With the rifles and bayo
nets there will come twelve machine 
guns, and a machine gun company 
will be formed.
On Monday five sacks of military 
literature arrived in the Colonels of
fice. A partial list of the books which 
arrived follow:
Machine Gun Manual 
Non-commissioned Officers Manual 
Engineers Field Manual 
Commanders Manual 
Medical Corps Manual 
Quartermasters Manual, also Funda

BUILDING OPERATIONS 
PROGRESSING RAPIDLY
Work on the new building, which 
will connect Industries and the Cen
tral Building, is progressing very rap
idly. While no speed records are be
ing established, as in the case of the 
Langley Laboratory, the newest link 
in Techs chain of buildings is round
ing into form as fast as weather will 
permit.
The foundations of the new Dormi
tory are completed and in a short time 
they, too, will form another addition 
to the ever increasing Tech group.
SCIENCE SOPHS TAKE 
LAW INTO OWN HANDS
One day last week the Science hall
way was the scene of quite a lively 
skirmish when a group of Sophomores 
decided to take into their own hands 
the punishment of at least one Plebe 
regulations violator. The unfortunate 
Plebe walked into the building all un
suspecting and was quickly assisted 
Into a nearby room by the Innocent 
looking Sophs, in the midst of much 
swinging of hands and feet the gentle
man was deposited unceremoniously 
on the floor, and the vile Sophs pro
ceeded to set upon various portions 
of his anatomy. Then regardless of 
the source of noise at the bottom of 
the pile, the clippers were brought 
from ther hiding place and put to good 
use. Other offenders beware!
As April 19 approaches all details 
of the Military Ball are nearing com
pletion. At a meeting of the general 
committee on Saturday afternoon all 
phases of the ball were discussed 
and in the light of this discussion, 
the affair promises to be one of the 
greatest events in Tech's history. A 
great many of the limited supply of 
tickets have already gone. Tuesday 
afternoon and Wednesday of this 
week have been settled upon as spe
cial ticket-campaigning days. It is 
advisable, if possible, to secure your 
tickets not later than Wednesday 
since the supply is limited.
Of course the details of the enter
tainment will remain secret until 
that night, but this much can be 
said: for those not wishing to dance 
cards will be provided; those who 
dance will find a flne ball room and 
the best music possibleand therell 
be more than this to while away the 
hours.
A late feature appearing from New 
York City in dance music is tlie 
so-called "Jazz Music.! This is quite 
a novelty, being strict rytheni (?) 
without regard, to harmony. Earl 
Fuller and his Jazz Band have made 
this type of music popular. A prom
inent Jazz artist describes a Jazz 
band as consisting of a pianist who 
can jump up and down when be 
plays, a saxophone player who can 
stand on Ills ear, a drummer whose 
right hand never has the faintest 
idea of what his loft is doing, a vio
linist who can dance the bearcat and 
a banjo plunker. When one of these 
bands Is in working order the hall 
Is tilled with flying feet and exclama
tions such as Atta Boy!" or "Swing 
Me Dizzy!
A still later and .somewhat more 
popular feature In dance music Is a 
somewhat conservative Jazz band, 
strictly speaking, a Jazz band with
out the Jazz, but with lots of pep 
and ginger. For the Military Ball, 
this latter organization lias been 
engaged to furnish the music. For 
director of the orchestra, Mr. George 
L. McNemry has been chosen. Mr. 
McNomry was for a number of years 
director of his own company hi the 
Redpatli Lyceum Circuit and Is 
known for Ills skill on banjo from 
coast; to coast. Since locating In 
Pittsburgh he has boon employed In 
various hotels and principally In the

ARCHITECTURAL CLUB 
EXHIBIT A SUCCESS
The exhibition of the Tech architec
tural club which opened last week has 
proven much more successful than 
was anticipated. Both faculty and stu
dents have taken a great deal of In
terest in the exhibition which is one 
of the best the club has ever held.
This collection of drawings consists 
of student work, done entirely without 
criticism, together with many pieces 
of work executed by the .faculty.
With nearly 50 of the clubs mem
bers in the service,' the remaining few 
are to be congratulated upon holding 
an exhibition of this calibre.
I The Hewlett Museum in the De

exhibition, is open from 9 till 5 each 
day.

ARCHITECTS TO AID 
LIBERTY LOAN DRIVE
Yesterday afternoon tlie BtudentH In 
the Department of Architecture were 
called together by Mr. McGoodwin 
who laid before them the appeal of 
the Liberty Loan committee for post
er and placards.
It has been decided by the faculty 
to give credit in freehand drawing to 
those who turn in work of sufficient 
merit to Justify it.
This plan will undoubtedly bring 
forth some very catchy slogans regard
ing tlie Third Liberty Loan and It is 
expected the campus will be dotted 
with these cards in a few days.
All news Items must be In the student postofllce, Central Building, before 
noon on Mondays.
THIRD LIBERTY LOAN
LendNot SpendYour Money.
If you lend your money to the Government, you may be quite 
sure that it is going to be used for some national purposeto pros
ecute the war successfully, to care for, equip, arm, and supply our 
soldiers in France,' to be used by our Navy in ridding the seas of 
the murderous U boats.
But if you spend your money even with the belief that by put
ting it into the channels of trade others into whose hands it comes 
will lend it to the Government, you will have done something the 
patriotism of which may be very questionable.
First, you have withdrawn from the supply of material of the 
Nation something to replace which in the market will require labor 
and material which should be devoted to war purposes.
Second, the person to whom you pay your money may also use 
it to purchase things requiring material and labor which should be 
devoted to war purposes. And the person to whom he pays it may 
repeat the operation.
But when you lend your money to the Government instead of 
spending it, you will at once lessen the drain to a certain extent on 
our countrys resources, its material, its labor, and its transportation 
facilities, and in addition you supply your Government with money 
to be used in winning the war.
Every purchase of a Liberty Loan Bond is an individual aet 
toward bringing victory to America and her allies.
Your Fifty Dollar Liberty Bond.
It will protect 1,000 soldiers from smallpox and (6(5 from ty
phoid. It will assuro tho safety of 139 wounded soldiers from lock
jaw, the germs of which swarm in Belgian soil.
It will render painless 400 operations, supply 2 miles of ban 
dagcsenough to bandage 555 wounds.
It will care for 160 injuries in tlie way of first-aid packets.
It will furnish adhesive plaster and surgical gauze enough to 
benefit thousands of wounded soldiers.
Kvory purchaser of a Liberty Loan Bond performs a distinct 
individual servieo to his country and to our boys fighting in 
Franco.
Wlmt Your Liberty Bond Will Accomplish.
$18,000 invested in Liberty Bonds will equip an infantry bat
talion with rifles.
$50,000 will construct a baso hospital with 500 beds, or equip 
an infantry brigade with pistols.
$100,000 will buy five combat airplanes, or pistols, rifles, and a 
half a million rounds of ammunition for an infantry regiment.
PROFESSOR LANGLEY
The discussion to which the naming of the Langley Laboratory 
of Aeronautics lead in the daily papers was indeed unfortunate, 
since the controversy was only one more of those things which cer
tainly do not tend to draw Pitt and Tech closer together. It is cer
tainly to the credit of the University, therefore, that they have not 
followed the lead of ill feeling as they might well have done. The 
following editorial from The Pitt Weekly takes credit to the Univer
sity where credit is due, and gives credit to the Institute where 
credit is deserved; it is headed, Langleys Achievement.
It is, indeed, gratifying to the alumni, students and faculty 
of the University to know that Prof. Langley at last has found 
recognition in the eyes of science.
Prof. Langley, LL.D., was teacher of Astronomy and Physics, 
and Director of the Observatory of the University from 1867 to 
1890. His memory was recalled in a fitting manner when the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology dedicated the hangar in which 
t.hc students of aeronautics of the United States Army, quartered 
there, will study the seiencc of which he was the discoverer.
We are proud of our record in the world of science and we 
bolieve wo can lay just claim to a glittering record not only in con 
qucring the forces above us, but also in making use of the elements 
boneath, and wo are more than gratified when we realize that it is 
in the field of seicnco upon which tho present; struggle of Democracy 
is resting, and that tho University of Pittsburgh has contributed her 
share in its development.
BASEBALL SCHEDULE TO 
OPEN WITH MUSKINGUM
Coach McCullough did much toward 
the final selection of the team which 
will cross bats with Muskingum in 
about ten days. He used the pruning 
hook and the smaller squad will now 
receive individual attention. Levine 
has been showing well behind the bat 
in the absence of Zehfuss. Stevens did 
well at first in the practice Saturday 
although his work was largely cur
tailed by a sore arm. Chris Brider is 
alternating with him at the first sack. 
Fulton was shifted from the outfield 
to second base and handled himself 
well. Jimmy' Doherty is cavorting 
shbrtfield and prospects are that he 
will live up to his reputation of past 
years. Windy Lynn is covering 
third. His fielding is fast, but so 
far his work at bat has not been very 
consistent. Pat I-Ioban is in right 
field and covers the sun garden handi
ly, but also has not developed his 
batting eye this spring. Gretzler has 
been covering center field when not on 
the mound and Good has been taking 
his place when Gretz is shifted. Willie 
Oakley in left field seems to be the 
find of the season. He is a fast man 
in the field and on the bases, and has 
been batting well above three hundred 
in the practice games.
The hurling staff still seems to pre
sent an enigma to Coach McCullough. 
Petch, a left hander, has been fairly 
effective. , Gretzler has been show
ing a lot of smoke, but has not been 
using many benders. Ray Cosgrove, 
one of the veterans, has not reported 
as yet and it is highly probable that 
he will try his luck on the mound, 
where he starred two seasons ago.

To modern German writers the

Let us see how these doctrines af

; DONT CLOSE SCHOOLS
Dont close the schools; use them 
to maximum capacity," says Secretary 
of the Interior Lane in approving a 
) statement from Washington by the 
Bureau of Education of his Depart
ment wherein is presented the Govern
ments need of the schools in war time 
as seen by those in Washington 
charged with the conduct of the war.
The statement says: The entire
spirit of the Administration in Wash
ington is and has been from the begin
ning that the war. should in no way he
used as an excuse for giving the chil
dren of the country any less education 
in quantity or quality than they other
wise would have had. Both the present 
demands of the war emergency and 
the prospective demands of the neces
sary readjustments inevitably to fol
low emphasize the need of providing 
in full measure for the education of 
all the people.
Regarding elementary schools the 
statement says: There appears to
be nothing in the present or prospec
tive war emergency to justify curtail
ment in any respect of the sessions of 
the elementary schools or of the educa
tion of boys and girls under 14 years 
of age and nothing which should serve 
as an excuse for interference with the
progressive development of the school 
system. Teachers and pupils should 
be encouarged to find ways of per
forming in the schools some service 
having war value, such as activities 
connected with the Junior Red Cross, 
war garden work. Boy Scouts, war 
thrift work and the like. Opportuni
ties should be found to introduce into 
the school activities having real educa
tional value which at the same time 
link up the public schools with the 
ideals of service and self-sacrifice 
actuating our people and bring home 
to the consciousness of teachers, pu
pils and patrons the essential unity of 
the nation in this great crisis.
As to the Governments need of high 
school students Secretaries Baker and 
Daniels point out that "the army and 
navy do not want and cannot use boys 
under IS years of age or boys or men 
of any age who are not strong and 
well developed physically. So far as 
the army and navy are concerned there 
is nothing more important that the 
schools can do than to keep going at 
full capacity and at the same time to 
emphasize in every possible way 
their work in physical education. High 
school boys will render the best ser
vice of which they are capable by re
maining in school until completion of 
the high school course.
Agricultural labor is emphasized as 
the most immediate possibility for 
high school boys. It cannot be too 
strongly urged, however, says the 
statement, that each pupils case 
should be consideerd individually and 
that no pupils be excused from school 
for this purpose except with the writ
ten consent of the parents to accept 
specified employment for a definite 
team under responsible supervision 
by the school or by other approved 
agencies of the conditions of employ
ment.
Civil service officials are equally em
phatic in their statement that nothing 
can be gained by shutting down the 
schools or by curtailing school facili
ties, but they suggest that since civil 
service positions have been filled by 
drawing workers from commercial and 
industrial houses and also by drawing 
teachers from the schools the schools 
could undoubtedly render a much 
needed service by organizing classes 
to train stenographers, typewriters, 
clerks and secretaries.
Regarding the need in industry, 
Government officials maintain that no 
emergency exists which justifies any 
relaxation of the laws safe-guarding 
the working conditions of our young 
people. The official statement points 
out that there are serious shortages in 
industry already and more are antici
pated, but boys and girls under IS 
years of age should not be used to 
make up these shortages any more 
than can possibly be helped. It is 
easier to provide approved working 
conditions on the farms than in the 
mill or factory.

MILITARY TRAINING AT W. & J.
Compulsory military training, insti

to be adopted at Washington and Jeff

the idea of making the training as

JUST AND RIGHTEOUS 
PEACE, AMERICAS AIM
The United States did not enter into 
this war unadvisedly, hastily, under 
stress of liqat or passion. We took 
the step calmly, soberly, reluctantly, 
with a full sense of the awful respon
sibility involved, the sacrifices de
manded,- the magnitude of the task.
President Wilson did not advise in 
his war message, nor did Congress 
act in declaring a state of war be
tween the United States and Germany 
without giving the most solemn con
sideration to what the action meant. 
They knew it meant the death of 
thousands of brave Americans; they 
knew it meant suffering and wounds 
and the disabling for life of hundreds 
of thousands of our young men. They 
counted to the full the human cost 
and the material cost.
Every development since has justi
fied and proved the wisdom and the 
imperative necessity of Americas par
ticipation. Every German success 
and every German failure have shown 
how necessary to our own welfare and 
peace, how necessary to the safety 
and peace of the world the defeat of 
Germany is. Every foot of ground 
Germany has been forced to give up, 
every foot of land she has seized, have 
demonstrated |tlie imperative neces
sity of defeating that sinister,, intol
erable thing called Germanism.
Germanism is 3,000 miles away. It 
must never come any nearer. Let this 
war result in anything but the defeat 
of Germany, let. her emerge with her 
power unbroken and her kultur still 
dominant, and it is but a question of 
time until we alone will be fighting 
Germany instead of warring against 
her with our Allies on our side.
Lincoln said that this country could 
not exist half slave and half free. All 
Americans now recognize that truth. 
The events of the last few years have 
shown equally clearly that tills world 
can not exist half free and half auto
cratichalf free people loving liberty 
and justice and peace, and half an 
autocracy seeking to dominate the 
world, caring nothing for liberty or 
justice and nothing for humanity and 
civilization where they interfere with 
its ambition.
There is no peaco for Amorica ex
cept a just peace, a peace that moans 
a world fit for freo peoplo to live in. 
German ideals, Gorman purposes, and 
German practices are the antliisesos 
of American. The beliefs wo lovo and 
honor and uphold are contemptible to 
them; the objects for which tlioy will 
to death millions of their own men and 
millions of their enemy are abhorrent 
to our Ideas of right and pustlce; their 
methods and practices In warfare are 
an abomination and horror to us.
The American who now advocates 
or wishoH for peace, oxcopt a just 
peaco, is either woefully misguided or 
a traitor to Americas future and 
Americas past, to all things American 
the things which liavo made our 
country great and froo, which hun
dreds of thousands of Americans have 
died to maintain and for which 
Americans now are dying In France.
There can bo no poaco with honor 
or safety to ourselves or to posterity, 
except a just poace, and thore can 
and will bo no other peaco. Work for 
peace accomplishes nothing but the 
hampering of our effort, the delay of 
the real peace, and a greater toll of 
death of Americas fighting men. Our 
duty is to war for a just and right
eous peace; to work or speak for any 
other peace is treason.

WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY
Taking a step beyond most of the 
higher institutions of learning in the 
country and getting into the front 
ranks with any of them, Washington 
University, St.' Louis, Mo., has created 
department of general literature, 
operative from the opening of the 
1918-19 college year.
These courses are to he open to 
juniors and seniors who have received 
credit for a total of at least thirty-six 
units acquired in more than one de
partment of language and literature.
The work of this department will 
deal with subjects of a more general 
character than those treated in the 
courses offered by the several linguis
tic and literary departments. The 
courses will include subjects pertain
ing to the history, aesthetics and tech
nic of the literary genera, methods of 
literary criticism and investigation 
and topics of comparative literature.
TAFT AT GETTYSBURG
Ex-President William Howard Taft 
will deliver the commencement ad
dress at Gettysburg College this year. 
While many of the usual ceremonies 
and festivities of Commencement 
Week will be omitted, It is hoped that 
these will be counterbalanced by the 
quality of this years exorcise.

for basketball in his Plebe year, and

for the fact that the doctors orders

SUMMER5EMPL0YMENT IN
SERVICE OF GOVERNMENT
(Continued From Page One.)
The letter from the Board follows: 
March 25, 1918. 
To Presidents of Certain Colleges: 
Dear Sir:
The Federal Board for Vocational 
Education has been asked to aid h 
getting young men for summer serv 
ice for the four branches of Govern
ment service mentioned in the en 
closed circular. The needs are. urg
ent, the opportunities for gaining 
experience exceptional, and the work 
constitutes a real war' service.
Details of the work, secured after 
conference with the proper officials, 
are enclosed. It is suggested that 
you turn the matter over to some 
member of your Faculty and that ho 
be asked to send to us, for trans
mission to the appropriate official, 
the names of those who may - decide 
to make application.
Wo are informed that the Civil
Service Commission has authorized 
the temporary employment of men 
properly qualified for this work, with
out formal examination, at wages de
pending upon their experience and 
abilities.
You will note that the period, May 
1 to October 1, is specified. This 
five months service, we understand, 
is essential in the opinion of the 
bureaus concerned, to the success of 
the work and it is hoped that it may 
be found possible for the college, not 
only to release well-qualified men 
May 1, but also to give them aca
demic credit for the work performed 
under this call for service. We are 
assured that the training will be 
of such quality as to justify college 
recognition.
We trust that you will be inclined 
to urge your ambitious students not 
be engaged during the summer in 
work of equal importance to the Na
tion, to undertake this training. Any 
further information at our command 
will be gladly furnished or such in
formation may be obtained directly 
from the bureau chiefs.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) C. A. PROSSER,
Director.
March 25, 1918. 
Opportunities for Technical Students:
The Federal Board for Vocational 
Education, acting entirely in an ad
visory capacity, has been asked to 
put the following information before 
the undergraduates and graduate 
students of the technical schools of 
the country.
It appears through conference with 
various department heads that val
uable opportunities exist in govern
ment service for work which will 
give an excellent training for occu
pations in civil life, and will lead 
also to specialized war work.
1. Most of the younger technical 
men from three branches of govern
ment servicethe Reclamation Serv
ice, the Bureau of Standards and the 
Geological Survey . (Topographical 
Branch)have been detailed for spe
cial war service, either here or 
abroad.
2. The draft has cut off their 
usual supply of new men.
3. This leaves .the personnel of 
these departments so depleted that 
it is almost impossible for them to 
do their regular work; only with dif* 
ficulty can they supply men needed 
for the army.
but
The work of the Departments must 
go on:
Men for the army must be trained.
In this emergency the Government 
calls upon the technical students of 
the country.
From May 1 to October 1, there is 
much work in these departments that 
can be performed by under grad
uates with technical training. Those 
particularly desired are young men 
of good physique who are below the 
draft age, and those members of the 
Enlisted Reserve who will not com
plete their college work before Oc
tober, 1918
Prerequisites.
For the Bureau of Standards:
Not ness than one year of work 
of college grade in Physics and Math 
ematics. (Special mechanical and 
testing skill is desirable.)
For the Reclamation Service:
Not less than one year of work 
of college grade in Civil Engineering 
and Surveying.
For the Geological Survey:
(Topographical Branch.)
Not less than one year of work of 
college grade in Civil Engineering. 
(Special work In map making is de
sirable.)
Men with drafting ability and ex
perience also particularly desired.
These indicate the minimum re
quirements; additional qualifications 
will lead to better paid positions.
In addition, the Ordnance Depart
ment of the United .States Army 
wishes to obtain 200 Draftsmen for 
work from May 1 to October 1, at 
salaries up to $100 per month.
The minimum requirement for 
these positions is two years of col
lege training in mechanical drafting 
or machine design.
More highly skilled men are need
ed for positions paying up to ?3,000 
per annum.

Sammy, which was written by Mr. 
John A. Carpentier, of the National 
Committee on Songs for the Soldiers. 
It wag very effective, but even more 
so was her stirring rendition of the 
Marseliellaise, which proved a most fit
ting encore.
Dean Breed announced the fact that 
the committee in charge of theThird 
Liberty Loan Drive at Carnegie In
stitute would be Professor Riggs, who 
would work with herself and who 
would be assisted by a number of 
young women from M. M. C. S. and 
Design, who will be stationed at 
booths in the school corridors. She ex
plained that the government wants 
millions of small subscribers to this 
loan, not a few large ones, and out
lined a plan whch ought to be well 
received. She suggested that each 
class and organization at Tech buy 
a bond of the fifty dollar denomination 
at least, and that these be let come 
to maturity in the possession of the 
Alumnito form, at some future date, 
a fund for the erection of a new mem
orial to those of. us who go, and more 
especially, to those who do not return.
Captain J. M. De Beaufort, soldier, 
journalist, and author was then intro
ducedand also Bob," who opened 
Captain De Beauforts address by ex
hibiting some very amusing as well 
as appropriate treks.
Captain De Beaufort delivered a 
very interesting talk, relating many 
personal experiences which stirred 
more than a few of those present. He 
entitled his address "Waiting, and 
then brought home to every one some 
idea of what that word meant, first 
in the early days of the war in Bel
gium, and then, later, in France, when 
the wait was not for immediate re-inforcements as it had formerly been, 
but for Americathe only possible 
aid. Some of the situations upon 
which he barely touched would make 
wonderful stories, and one could see 
by the way in which he impressed his 
points that he is a mas ter-writer as 
well as fighter. His little sory of the 
receiving of the news "America is our 
ally, was a masterpiece. He speaks! 
with such earnestness and sincere feling that one is carried away by his 
eloquence.
The message which America has 
brought into this war, Captain De 
Beaufort says, is one that the enemy 
has not yet begun to understand, but 
which is none the less potent and true 
the message of the American flag: 
"Wherever I have flown in the past, 
wherever I shall fly in the future, I 
always have stood and always shall 
stand for Liberty, Justice and Vic
tory.
Mrs. Clemson sang "Glory, Glory, 
Hallelujah, with such beauty and 
feeling as to lend to the song a dignity 
and meaning few of her hearers had 
ever realized it held.
Miss Eula Guy recited Thomas 
Wood Stevens Peddler of Destiny, 
which was written to be used especial
ly in the interests of the Third Lib
erty loan, and the assembly closed by 
singing The Star-Spangled Banner, 
Mrs. Clemson leading.

drew some very vivid pictures of what 
the work of doctors and nurses at 
the front is like. Miss Engstromer 
mentioned several cases of skin-graft
ing and the re-modeling of features, 
and explained that medical massage 
removed, to a great extent, the scars 
caused by such operations. There is 
a great demand for workers, she says, 
not alone abroad, but here as well, 
for soon the blinded and crippled will 
be coming back, and people will be 
needed to teach them to read and 
write and to help make a living for 
themselves. Miss Engstromer said 
that this was her first public appear
ance, but her very naivete won every 
listener, and no one wonders that her 
patients would do anything for her.
Dean Breed announced that the 
women of student body and faculty 
would be addressed Wednesday after
noon in the M. M. C. S. assembly 
room by Miss Engstromer, and that 
an informal Hoover Tea would be 
held.
The next number on the program 
was a song by Mrs. Christine MillerClemson, an old friend of most Tech 
students, who has been singing for 
the soldiers in southern camps late
ly. She sang a new song, Khaki
