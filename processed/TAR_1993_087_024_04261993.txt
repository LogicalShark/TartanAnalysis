Fraternities to apply for ATO house
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
National representatives from two fraternities 
will be meeting with a special committee this 
Thursday as part of the process of re-allocating 
1091 Morewood, the house in which Alpha Tau 
Omega is now located.
Alpha Epsilon Pi will speak before the committee 
at 7 pm in the Tech lounge in Resnik. Sigma Tau 
Gamma will do the same at 8 pm.
The committee will be made up of members from 
Interfratemity Council, Greek Council, Panhellenic 
Council, Student Senate, and Student Dormitory 
Council. It will be chaired by Pat Hamed, Greek 
advisor.
According to Hamed, the 1091 Selection Com
mittee is an ad hoc committee that will make a 
recommendation to Student Affairs as to which 
fraternity will receive the house. It does not have 
final decision making power, according to Hamed.
It would probably be a significant step forward 
if AEPi were given the house, said Doug Brook, 
president of AEPi. According to Brook, the frater
nity has been moving from place to place as its 
membership growB. AEPi currently resides in spe
cial interest housing and applied to live in the old 
Chi Omega house for one year. Its difficult to 
maintain a brotherhood if you dont know where 
youre going to be, said Brook.
Aaron Long, president of Sig Tau, expressed 
similar views about the possibility of his fraternity 
living in the house. A fraternity isnt much with
out a common area. That is something we dont 
have, said Long. SigTau currently is housed in the 
A Tower of Doherty Apartments, occupying seven 
out of 12 quad apartments. The other five are 
occupied by students not affiliated with Sig Tau, 
and this has caused problems for the fraternity, 
according to Long. It isnt very conducive to booth 
building and rushing, said Long.
AEPi was colonized at CMU in fall 1984 and 
received its official charter in 1987. It has 33 
brothers. Sig Tau was made up of former brothers 
of Zeta Beta Tau, who colonized under the name 
Tau Delta Phi, and received a Sig Tau national 
charter in 1985. It has approximately 40 members., Please see HOUSE, page 3

Senate creates security council
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
On April 13, Student Senate passed 
by acclamation proposal S93-15, a pro
posal for a Student Security Council. 
The proposal was originally based on a 
recommendation to Student Senate 
by Campus Police Chief James LaPaglia on March 20,1993, in response 
to the increasing concerns about cam
pus crime. The council was created to 
stimulate student involvement in cam
pus security issues.
Because ofthe increasing incidence 
of crime on campus and in the sur
rounding vicinity, there is a very real 
needforthe students ofthe University 
to have a say in their security and 
safety, the proposal reads. [This] 
proposal is submitted suggesting the 
formation of a student-populated ad
visory council focused on student se
curity and safety concerns. The Stu
dent Security Council would meet at 
least once a month with the Security 
Director as chair of the council.
The proposal was originally written
by Greg Haverkamp, chair of Student 
Senate. The proposal as passed by 
Student Senate states that the coun
cil should consist of three on-campus 
undergraduate students, three offcampus undergraduate students, and 
four graduate students. According to 
the proposal, these three categories of 
members are important to allow for 
many views to be presented.
Accordingto the proposal, members 
of the council should be selected near 
the end of the academic year prior to 
the year of service. Recruitment of 
the members should be handled jointly 
by the Student Government Presi
dent and Student Senate, the pro
posal states.
S93-15 was originally drafted on 
April 6, according to Haverkamp. I 
think [the council] serves to fill a niche 
in student involvement in their com
munity, said Haverkamp.
Haverkamp also said that the draft 
of the proposal was approved by Stu
dent Government President Dave 
Martin before the proposal was subPlease see COUNCIL, page 3
University delays Skibo destruction until December
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Office of the Vice President of 
Business Affairs announced last week 
thatthedemolitionofSkibo Hall will not 
take place until December rather than 
this summer, as was expected.
The announcement came shortly after 
Student Senate passed a 
resolution askingthe admin
istration to delay Skibos de
struction until the Naval 
Reserve Center is available 
for use by the student body.
CIT Senator Burt Holzman, 
a sophomore mechanical en
gineering major, introduced 
the resolution.
Its a very positive move, 
said Holzman, who said that he isnt emphasized that there is a strong comsure how directly related the decision mitment for funding.
of feedback from student organizations 
about how disruptive it would be not to 
have that space available. There were 
strong recommendations that we should 
wait until the site was available.
In addition, Bolton said that the Uni
versity was waiting for the funding to 
become more clear. We still dont have 
the funding in hand, he said. Bolton
It's not a good idea to tear the 
building down until we know that 
we're ready to build a new one.  
 Edward Schatz, 
Senior VP for Business Affairs
was to the Senate resolution, since both 
were released around the same time. 
Im very glad to hear it.
There are actually a number of rea
sons, said Jeffrey Bolton, assistant vice 
president for Planning and Budgets. The 
Naval Center is not likely to be available 
until December, and weve received a lot
Some students will see the delay as a 
negative thing, saidHolzman, because 
they wont see the fruits of construction 
until December. Overall, though, he 
thinks that the positive of allowing stu
dent organizations to remain in Skibo 
rather than having to move into trail
ers or tents outweighs the negatives.
Given the potential displacement of 
student organizations, dining services, 
and a number of important major uni
versity events, wrote Vice President for 
Business Affairs and University Plan
ning Patrick Keating in an open letter to 
the campus community, we have de
cided to delay the demolition until after 
the Naval Reserve Center is available, 
and this transition can be 
comfortably achieved with 
limited disruption.
This decision is consistent 
with input we have received 
from many campus constitu
ents, including ... a recent 
resolution to the president 
passed by Student Senate. 
It seemed wise to hold up 
^m the demolition of Skibo,"said 
Edward Schatz, senior vice president 
for Business Affairs. First, he said, to 
give the University time to fix up the 
Naval Reserve Center, and because I 
dont think we were quite ready to break 
ground anyway.
The trustees have not given final ap
proval to the project yet, said Schatz.

Campus employees, members 
of Service Employees Interna

held a protest on Forbes Avenue 
in front of Warner Hall. Physical 
Plant staff and grounds workers 
held up signs saying Stop stall
ing and We want a fair con
tract and handed out buttons 
and flyers last Thursday at noon. 
The same employees held a simi
lar demonstration Friday at noon, 
in support of workers for Carnegie 
Mellon Dining Services in the Tar
tan Grill in Skibo Hall. According 
to witnesses, the workers stood 
along the wall near the Graduate 
Cafe, pounding ash trays, cups, 
and other objects in time with 
music. Afterwards, the workers 
marched to Warner Hall to ex
press their frustration at what 
they called the Administrations 
unwillingness to negotiate a con
tract with the union. SEIU mem
bers at CMU have been working 
without a contract since Novem
ber 30.
SEIU Local 29 represents work
ers employed by Dining Services, 
Physical Plant, as well as custo

ees.
The University has been avail
able to negotiate since early De
cember, said Walter DeForest, 
an attorney with Reed, Smith, 
Shaw, and McClay hired by the 
University to negotiate with the 
union. The University believes
that it has provided a contract 
offer that is fair to the members 
of the union.
According to Jack Yoedt, presi

has put off negotiations with the 
union over the new contract since 
the old contract expired in No

DeForest says that the union is 
responsible for the delay innego

CFA, H&SS create new 
interdisciplinary degree
By M.K. RODGERS
Tartan Contributing Editor
The College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences (H&SS) and the 
College of Fine Arts (CFA) have 
announced the institution of a 
new interdisciplinary degree for 
the 1993-94 academic year.
The Bachelor of Arts and Hu
manities (BAH) degree will com
bine aspects of the general edu
cation program in H&SS with 
concentration areas in both col
leges.
According to Lisa Lightner, 
assistant director of public rela
tions for H&SS, the program 
will allow students to receive 
broader exposure to the humani
ties and the liberal arts than 
would be possible through CFAs 
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree 
program or H&SSs Bachelor of 
Arts degree program.
The program, which would 
allow for five to 10 freshmen 
each year as well as a certain 
number of internal transfers, is 
quite unique, says Lightner. 
Students would be required to 
take nine courses out of the stan
dard 14 in the general educa
tion program.
These courses include the 
writing, statistics, and world 
cultures requirements as well 
as six distributional classes cho
sen from the programs menu 
electives. After fulfilling the 
basic part of the program, stu
dents would then choose a con
centration that draws from both 
colleges.
Tho BAH allowB for a choice 
from three concentrations, al
though the dotails for several of 
the programs have yet to be fi
nalized.
The departmentally-focused 
concentration includes a 12- 
course program in a CFA de
partment as well as a six-course 
sequence in H&SS that comple
ments the CFA focus.
An interdepartmentally-focused concentration combines 
work across departments in CFA 
as well as H&SS courses that 
complement the chosen area of 
study.
The third concentration is self
defined, determined by the stu
dent and his or her advisors with 
approval by the BAH oversight 
committee.
Beyond these requirements, 
BAH students will have 13 free 
electives that can be devoted to 
other areas of interest.
In a press release, Lightner 
says that the entering BAH 
class will be a relatively small 
and selected group of students. 
The program will be adminis
tered by the office of Jay Devine, 
associate dean of H&SS and be 
very reliant on extensive advis
ing.
Interested students will be eli
gible to apply to the 3-1-1 pro
gram with the H. John Heinz III 
School of Public Policy and Man
agement. These students will 
obtain a BAH degree after four 
years and a Masters in Arts 
Management after one addi
tional year of study.

Thousands march in D.C. for gay rights
WASHINGTON, April 25 (AP)  
U.S. Park police estimated that 
300,000 people turned out in Wash
ington for todays gay rights inarch 
and rally. Thousands gathered on the 
National Mall in Washington to de
mand acceptance and equal rights for 
gays,'lesbians, and bisexuals.
Crowds clogged streets and parks 
on a warm, sunny spring day, hear
ing speakers calling for equal rights, 
an end to the ban on gays in the 
military, and more funding for AIDS 
research. Organizers of the march 
released a list of seven demands, in
cluding:
 A change in the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act to protect lesbian, gay, and bi
sexual Americans, and a repeal of all 
sodomy laws and other laws that 
criminalize private sexual expres
sion between consenting adults.
 Massive increases in funding 
for AIDS 'education, research, and 
patient care, and universal accesB to 
health care.
 Legislation to end discrimination 
against lesbians, gays, and bisexuals 
in areas of child custody, foster care, 
and adoption.
 Equal inclusion oflesbians, gays, 
and bisexuals in the educational sys
tem and in multicultural studies cur
ricula.
 The right to reproductive free
dom and the choice to control our 
own bodies.
 An end to racial and ethnic dis
crimination in all forms.
 An end to discrimination and vio
lent oppression based on sexual ori
entation or identification, race, reli
gion, age, class, or AIDS/HTV infection.
President Bill Clinton did not attend 
the march, but sent a statement which 
was read by Congresswoman Nancy 
Pelosi (D-Calif.). In it, the President 
said he He committed to gay rights and 
proud of the progress made in that 
direction.
The President noted that the Penta
gon haB stopped asking recruits about 
their sexual orientation and that the 
secretary of defense is working on a 
plan to lift the ban.
Clinton also said his 1994 budget 
increases funding for AIDS research, 
and that he will soon announce a new 
AIDS coordinator to implement the 
recommendations of the AIDS com
mission.
Congressman Barney Frank (DMass.) was one of the speakers. Frank 
is one of two openly gay members of 
CongresB.
Carnegie Mellon University staff 
member Todd Jonker, of the Informa
tion Technology Center, spoke about 
the importance of the march. I think 
its really important that we all stand 
up and be counted. Its important the 
country gets a good grip on whos out 
there.... Everybody has gay people in 
their lives, said Jonker.
CMU student Brad Mumpower, a 
sophomore psychology major, said This 
was my first march. It was amazing.... 
Yesterday I met with students from all 
over the country. Today, I marched 
with them.

Waco cult bodies 
to be examined
FORT WORTH, April 25 (AP)  In
vestigators expect to bring out the re
mains of four more bodies from the 
burned-out cult compound near Waco, 
Texas today.
At a news conference yesterday, Dr. 
Nizan Peerwani. the Tarrant County 
medical examiner, said six autopsies 
have been performed on the remains of 
cult members, but no identifications have 
been made.
Peerwani also said that two victims 
found in the rubble of the compound 
died of gunshot wounds to the head. He 
refused to elaborate on the wounds or 
say when the shooting may have oc
curred.
Most forensic investigators left the 
compound yesterday, so thousands of 
rounds of bullets and other weapons 
could be removed.
Russia votes on 
referendum
MOSCOW, April 24 (AP)  Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin says a referen
dum on his leadership and early elec
tions are a peaceful way to settle Russias 
power struggle.
Yeltsin appealed for support in a tele
vised address on the eve of the referen
dum. The polls already are open in the 
Russian Far East.
Yeltsin urged Russians to endorse 
early parliamentary elections this fall. 
He says a vote for him is a vote for a new 
constitution, which he envisions as guar
anteeing a stronger presidency. The con
stitution would replace the Congress of 
Peoples Deputies with an Americanstyle legislature.
The president warned Russians not to 
heed critics of his economic policies.
Yeltsin says a decline in the standard of 
living is the price Russia has had to pay 
to escape decades of dead-end econom
ics. But he says the worst is over.
In Russias Far East, voters are trudg
ing through a light snow and 21-degree 
temperatures to cast their ballots on 
Russias future.
In the Pacific port ofVladivostok, turn
out was brisk and some of the first voters 
said they wanted Yeltsin to finish what 
he started.
Results wont be officially in until May 
3, but partial, incomplete results should 
be available early this week.
Strikes against 
Serbs endorsed
MIDDELFART, DENMARK, April 24 
(AP)  The European Community is 
moving closer to endorsing selective air 
strikes against the Serbs to end the war 
in Bosnia.
Foreign ministers of the 12 EC coun
tries met in Denmark today to consider 
new steps to end the conflict.
The Danish foreign minister says no 
options have been ruled out. The French 
foreign minister says aerial strikes are a 
possibility, but his German counterpart 
says they should a last resort.
The envoys also discussed lifting the 
arms embargo on Bosnias Muslims, but 
Britain and France oppose such a move.
A British official says his country has 
assured Canada that Britain will use air 
power to protect Canadian peacekeep
ing troops in Srebrenica.
The town in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina is surrounded by Serb forces and 
had been the scene of fierce fighting 
until a cease-fire a week ago.
Earlier, the Bosnian Serbs rejected a 
compromise peace plan that could have 
averted the tighter sanctions due to take 
effect against the former Yugoslavia on 
Monday.
The Danish foreign minister says the 
international community must send a 
very clear message to Serbia  make 
peace or face total isolation.
Shuttle delayed, 
Germany waiting
CAPE CANAVERAL, April 25 (AP)  
German space officials, who have waited 
years for a laboratory research mission 
aboard a U.S. space shuttle, are express
ing disappointment over the latest set
back but relief that another launch at
tempt will be made soon.
NASA called off the launch of the space 
shuttle Columbia just hours before liftoff 
Saturday because of navigation system 
trouble. Liftoff is rescheduled for today 
at 10:50 am. Countdown is expected to 
resume tonight.
Technicians replaced the faulty navi
gation aid, and said that there were no 
further problems.
NASAs first and only other attempt to 
launch Columbia on the German-spon
sored laboratory research mission ended 
with an engine shutdown three seconds 
before liftoff last month.
German space officials say each day of 
delay at this point adds about $157,500 
to Germanys mission costs.
Germany has already spent $569 mil
lion on the mission, which features two 
German astronauts and mostly German 
experiments. The mission is five years 
overdue.
NASA officials said last week that the 
late landing of the shuttle Discovery 
would not affect the date of launch for 
the current mission.

ther fireworks were found. Two 
CMU students were issued inter
nal citations for disorderly con
duct and recklessly endangering 
apother person for intentionally 
shooting fireworks into the crowd 
on the field.
4/13 TRESPASS, 3:05 am. A 
student called Campus Police and 
stated that a person had just
asked the complainant to let him 
into a computer cluster to study. 
A person fitting the description 
was stopped on the second floor of 
Doherty Hall. He said that he 
was on campus studying with a 
friend, but no such person was 
found in the C-Book. The 
tresspasser said that he had not 
been in any of the rooms in 
Doherty Hall, but when Doherty 
2315 was checked, the respond
ing officer found a bike, two back
packs, and a bike helmet. One of 
the bags contained a birth certifi
cate belonging to him. He was 
advised that he was trespassing 
because he was not affiliated with 
the University and was issued a 
state citation for defiant trespass.
4/15 INCIDENT, 6:30 pm. As 
students were arriving in Scaife 
Hall to take an exam, they saw a 
fake notice posted on the door 
that said exam cancelled, post
poned until next week. More 
than half the students left after 
seeing the sign, which had been 
laser-printed to look official. Dean 
Kail and Dean Murphy were no
tified, a complaint was filed, and 
an investigation instigated.
4/21 ASSAULT, 7:42pm. Cam
pus Police was notified of a fight 
in front of Warner Hall, on the 
Cut. Upon arrival, the officers 
found that the two men fighting 
had been separated by an offduty CMU officer who was 
enroute to work when he observed 
the altercation. A man told the 
reporting officer that after cross
ing Forbes Avenue from 
Morewood Gardens, someone in 
a red, older-model vehicle had 
started yelling at him and a 
friend. One ofthe passengers kept 
yelling out the window from the
CMDS employees ask for fair contract

step backwards, in our 
view. DeForest also said 
that employees were for
going a wage increase of 3 
percent, which is one part 
of the new contract that was 
rejected.
However, Yoedt said in 
an earlier interview that the 
contract is unfair to newly 
hired employees, because of 
a different wage scale and 
job classifications [Service 
workers union protests new 
employment contract, 3/8].
[Friday], six Dining Ser
vices employees were sent 
home because they didnt 
have their uniforms on, 
said George Papuga, Union 
Steward for Local 29. For 
18 months they havent re
ceived new uniforms. It says 
in their contract that once a 
year they are to receive 
three uniforms. People are 
running out of them be
cause of normal wear and 
tear.... They wear them five 
days a week. The mechan
ics from Physical Plant and 
the truck drivers came over 
to show that were behind 
the Dining Service people. 
We came over to show our 
support.
Some people present for 
the Tartan Grill demonstra
tion appearedtobe confused 
about the nature ofthe pro
test. Justin Crout, a fresh
man mechanical engineer
ing miyor, said that the
workers made no state
ment. They used theircups 
and did a rap. Thero was no 
speech. We didnt know any
thing about it. One group 
of students said that they 
were unaware that a pro
test had occurred.
A Dining Service em
ployee who asked not to be 
identified said All we want 
is a fair contract, something 
that we can live with. We 
have asked for information 
which we've never re
ceived, she said. The em
ployee said that the infor
mation requested was 
business information ... 
numbers and figures.
Theyve proposed a third 
rate of pay thats so low, 
[those at that rate will] be 
eligible for food stamps. 
They want to raise the price 
of our insurance, but they 
wont give us more money 
to pay for the insurance, 
she said. "Our pension plan 
is very bad. They worry 
about the golf course, the 
new buildings, but they 
dont care about us.
Employees have been told 
that the Presidents office 
refuses to negotiate further 
because the last offer offi
cially proposed was the fi
nal offer, she said.
Deforest said that the 
unions new demands aro 
counter to the tentative 
agreement that was 
reached in November.
Campus Affairs approves council
COUNCIL, from pago 1

quite a while, said Martin. The idea 
here is to give students a voice about

Burt Holzman, chair of tho Campus 
Affairs Committee, said that the com
mittee made some minor changes and 
cleaned up tho document before passing 
it by a vote of 3-1-1.
Holzman said, I think it will provide 
a solid opportunity for students with 
campus security concerns to discuss 
those concerns with Chief LaPaglia. Itll 
take a lot of the work load off of Senate

AEPi offers some unique and positive 
things to the campus community, said 
Brook. Brook cited AEPis non-alcoholic 
social events and philanthropic acts as 
reasons to be located in the ATO house. 
We suffered a bit by being in a very nonvisible location, said Brook.
Long spoke of the lack of a gathering 
area for Sig Tau brothers as one reason 
for Sig Tau to receive the house. Long 
said that Sig Tau had no exclusionary 
area in Doherty, where other students 
reside. We cant just kick them out. It 
wouldnt be polite, said Long of the 
other students living in Doherty.

vehicle, which was heading east 
on Forbes. The man then picked 
up a pebble and threw it at the 
vehicle. One passenger exited the 
vehicle and assaulted the man, 
hitting him in the face and head. 
His face was red and his cheek 
was swelling, but he refused 
transportation to the hospital. His 
shirt was also tom in the alterca
tion. There were two witnesses to 
the incident, and the both gave 
the same account as the man who 
was assaulted.
The person who assaulted the 
man was arrested for public in
toxication. After arrest, the of
ficer frisking him found a small 
amount of green vegetable sub
stance, believed to be marijuana, 
in the actors coat pocket. The 
substance was taken into evi
dence and the actor was trans
ported to the Public Safety Build
ing and charged with public in
toxication and possession of a 
small amount of marijuana.

DELAY, from page 1
University Center], we have to have a fair amount 
of work done getting bids for the project. That 
process is expected to take a few months, Schatz 
said.
We had hoped that we would start tearing down 
the building in early June so that we could break 
ground in December. [But] its not a good idea to 
tear the building down until we know that were 
ready to build a new one, said Schatz, laughing. 
That, plus the need to accommodate the residents 
of Skibo ... came together and we said, Lets just 
delay. 
According to Keatings letter, acquisition of the 
Naval Reserve Center will not take place until 
September, and renovations are expected to take 
from 45 to 60 days.
Skibo will be available until December, said 
Bolton. Dining Service is developing a plan. One of 
the scenarios includes operating in Skibo until 
demolition ... but its not clear at what level of 
capacity.
Bolton said that there may be limited food ser
vice in the Naval Reserve Center. One proposal 
would be use one or more of the meeting rooms in
the building as dining facilities, which Bolton said 
would support catering. Howevor, Morowood Court 
and the Highlander Cafe are expected to replace 
most of the Bervice lost at Kiltie Court, and dining 
cart service, similar to that in the lobby of Wean 
Hall, will be increased.
In addition, Bolton said that there is a commit
ment to continuing the operation of campus retail 
services now located in Skibo, such as Entropy, the 
Art Store, and the Carnegie Shoppe. It is unclear at 
this point, however, where they would bo located 
on campus.
Student organizations who wanted to request 
space in the Naval Reserve Center have been 
asked to submit a Skibo space reservation form to 
Student Activities by April 26. Confirmations will 
be made during the week of May 3.

Thistles and Thorns
Each year, The Tartans edito
rial board takes the opportunity in 
the last issue of the school year to 
sum up for the campus exactly what 
we think about people, organiza
tions, and events  both on cam
pus and off. Thistles are the 
thumbs-up, year-end rewards for 
those we think have done a good 
job and deserve a pat on the back. 
Thoms are the thumbs-down, 
messages to those we see as need
ing improvement or who have just 
messed up completely.
Campus politics draws the first 
set of Thistles and Thoms. To the 
Senators who killed the Resolu
tion Concerning ROTC Students 
Rights at CMU, a Thistle for put
ting this issue back to rest. But a 
Thorn to Senator James Brown 
(CIT), the resolutions sponsor, for 
jumping up and down on the ashes 
of a horse that died and was cre
mated two years ago. Senate should 
have better things to do than go 
back and forth over issues that 
were thoroughly debated when the 
original resolution came up. A 
Thorn also goes to the entire stu
dent body for the vacancies that 
existed all semester on Student 
Senate  if students want thor
ough representation, we should be 
willing to do some of the work. But 
some good did come out of Senate 
this year.
The Campus Affairs Committee, 
and especially its chair, Burt 
Holzman, deserve Thistles for ac
complishing a great deal this year, 
including the new poster policy. 
On the issue of audience participa
tion, Senate Chair Gregory 
Haverkamp gets a Thorn for prac
tically cutting audience members 
out of discussion entirely, while 
Student Government President 
David Martin gets a Thistle for 
opening up the floor to the audi
ence during the debate on the most 
recent ROTC resolution contro
versy.
For our next section, we take aim 
at Warner Hall and other branches 
of the administration, which have 
drawn their share of Thistles and 
Thorns in the past year. Univer
sity President Robert Mehrabian, 
gets 24 and 1/2 Thorns  one for 
each inch of snow that faculty, staff, 
and students had to dig their way 
through in order to get to the only 
campus in the Pittsburgh area that 
was open in the aftermath of the 
Blizzard of93. And a Thorn to the 
administrators who havent done 
anything about the fact that the 
Fence is falling down (again). Cam
pus landmarks that students care 
about are few and far between, so 
doing something about the Fence 
would be a good move. CMDS gets 
a Thistle for improving service at 
Salads Plus, and a Thom for the 
declining service everywhere else 
and losing money in the process.
Campus Police and Student Af
fairs get a Thistle for moving to 
increase lighting and security on 
campus afer the two rapes this 
semester. But they get a 'ITiom for 
not doing it sooner so that the rapes 
(not assaults like the releases 
said  another Thom for that) 
might have been prevented. Escort 
also draws a thorn for not increas
ing service.
But we do have a few Thistles for 
the higher-ups at CMU. Student 
Affairs, and especially the Fresh
man Orientation program, gets a 
Thistle for the success of Playfair 
during Orientation 92. And a 
Thistle to the administrators in 
H&SS who came up with the new 
general education program  it 
looks good. CMU also gets a Thistle 
for climbing in the U.S. News and 
World Reports national rankings, 
but a Thorn for remaining low in 
student satisfaction. What hap
pened to the Quality of Life move
ment in Warner Hall?
Physical Plant gets a whole bas
ketful of Thoms for a general level 
of annoyance over the past year. It 
should rightfully share in 
Mehrabians Thoms for the bliz
zard, especially for its failure to dig 
out most of the dorms when stu
dents had to get to class. Another 
Thom is for Physical Plants failure 
to make necessary repairs to Skibo, 
and for its slowness in taking care 
of problems caused by vandals. Of 
course, the vandals get their own 
Thom for such immature and de
structive behavior. But Physical 
Plant does get one Thistle  what 
other school gets such high-quality 
manure, so fresh it steams, spread 
all over any grassy area in sight? 
Yale should be jealous.
Everyone who participates in stu
dent activities based in Skibo should 
be breathing a sigh of relief. We 
never thought wed be saying this, 
but a Thistle to the administration 
for delaying the destruction of Skibo 
until at least winter break next 
year, so that the Naval Building 
will be ready for occupation. Of 
course, there is a catch  everyone 
involved also gets a Thom for post
poning this decision until the 11th 
hour, and for delaying the Univer
sity Center for yet another year.
To all the students who get in
volved outside of academics, we send 
a Thistle  and to those who dont, 
a Thorn. Freshman Rebecca 
Fruehan, a member of the swim 
team, gets a Thistle for making AllAmerican. And the mens basket
ball team gets a Thistle for having 
its best season since 1976-77.The 
Kiltie Band gets a Thistle for its 
amazing school spirit  and for 
showing off all those sexy legs. 
Scotch n Soda deserves a Thistle 
for its productions of March of the 
Falsettos and Falsettoland, just be
cause they were so damned good. 
The Beaux Arts committee gets a 
Thistle for pulling off the Ball this 
year, but the Ball itself gets a Thom 
for not living up to expectations.
WRCT deserves a Thistle for 
boosting its power and range, so 
students who live off campus can 
actually tune in. SDC gets a Thistle 
for urging a change in the micro
wave policy, and Scotland Yard gets 
a Thistle for bringing back blender 
drinks and creating the Ross.The 
new organization ALLIES gets a 
Thistle for making an attempt to 
curb homophobia on campus. The 
Womens Center earned a Thistle 
for the vast improvement of its im
age on campus over the past year. 
And being hateful never accom
plishes anything, so a Thom to those 
involved in painting boo the fag 
actors on the Fence last semester, 
as well as to whoever spitefully 
erased the Student Union's hard 
drive.
Weve also had some great lec
tures and performers on campus 
this year, thanks to student organi
zations. AB Lectures and SDC get a 
joint Thistle for bringing Dr. Ruth, 
as do the Womens Center and the 
Literary and Cultural Studies pro
gram for Susie Bright. But AB Con
certs gets a Thom for bringing Live! 
(*yawn*) to Carnival, when so many 
other groups would have had much 
more appeal.
Finally, wed like to offer Thistles 
to our graduating staff. Theyve 
made great contributions to The 
Tartan over the years, and well 
miss them. Good luck to our gradu
ates: Christian Restifo, Michael 
Gabriel, Glen Hoffman, Susan 
Abrams, Timothy Blass, D.A.

Letters to the Editor
Student Union member ROTC resolution insulted 
resigns from Collective people, wasted time
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I would like to pub
licly and officially an
nounce ray resignation 
from The Student 
Union Collective and 
my official position of business man
ager. I am doing this partially because 
I feel I cannot devote the necessary time 
to The Union at the expense of my 
coursework. But the main reason I can
not continue with The Union can be 
summed up in two words  David 
McWade.
McWade, although his heart is in the 
right place, has done nothing but frus
trate me and subterfuge [sic] the paper. 
He has never, to my knowledge, com
pleted an article on deadline; indeed, the 
paper would often be held up waiting for 
him to finish typing it. This resulted in 
unnecessary tension, as the rest of us 
felt frustrated by McWades disdain for 
our deadlines.
Most of the members of the Collective 
place The Union below their academic 
work. This is rightly so, as we receive no 
academic credit or payment for putting 
out The Student Union. Unfortunately, 
McWade does not have these priorities; 
he would rather spend time on a small 
Btudent paper with a circulation of 4,500 
than anything else, including his 
coursework (which is why he has been 
here for five years in a four year program 
and could be here for a sixth).
So, seeing as he felt no one else could 
dedicate enough time, McWade took it 
upon himself to declare himself Editorin-Chief and begin to dictate rules and 
impose hierarchies and official posi
tions upon other members of the Collec
tive. This is in direct opposition to the 
principles of the original Student Union 
Collective, which promoted democratic 
decision-making and a purposeful lack 
of central power. McWade has said that 
he did what was necessary to keep the 
Union alive, yet the upcoming issue has 
been delayed for over four days because 
he once again failed to finish his contri
butions in a timely, efficient manner.
McWade has made several large deci
sions without consulting a majority of 
the Collective members, has written 
unsigned editorials without fielding 
other opinions (like the Student Govern
ment President endorsement), and be
lieves he can run a periodical when it is 
all too obvious that he has a hard enough 
time keeping his own life in order. He 
has turned The Union into some 
Orwellian nightmare in order to serve 
his own ambitious goals. His desire for 
power is disgustingly apparent, and I 
can put up with it no longer. I might be 
able to pardon his monomania if he were 
an excellent and original writer, but this 
is not the case.
McWade himself accurately summed 
up the reason why I will not work with 
him any longer: Since when has this 
been a collective, anyway? Perhaps he 
might ponder his own statementand 
answer it himself. Until he is no longer 
affiliated with the inner organization of 
The Student Union, I cannot return. 
Good luck and patience to the rest of the 
Collective.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
CIT Senator James 
Browns Resolution 
Concerning ROTC 
Students Rights on 
Campus was a waste 
of time. To bring up the whole issue 
mere months before it could become moot 
was foolish. To draft this so-called com
promise resolution after only consulting 
one side of the issue was inconsiderate. 
To force a vote the week before the 1993 
March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, 
and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation, 
potentially the largest civil rights march 
ever, was an insult to every gay, lesbian, 
and bisexual person on this campus.
I believe it became clear during debate 
that the issue wasnt ROTC students 
rights. The standing Resolution against 
Discrimination by ROTC at Carnegie 
Mellon never addressed ROTC students 
only ROTC as an organization. ROTC 
students have the same rights as other 
students on campus: they may join or 
form a recognized student organization, 
such as Society of the Prow, to partici
pate in Carnival. Allowing discrimina
tory, non-recognized organizations such 
as ROTC to participate directly would 
be an inappropriate use of Activities Fee 
funds.
The issue is, and always has been, one 
of discrimination. Is it right for CMU to 
actively participate in a program that 
discriminates? What message does it 
send to gay, lesbian, and bisexual stu
dents who see ROTC events on campus, 
when they know they are not permitted 
to join the ROTC program? What mes
sage would it have sent to the student 
who was kicked out of ROTC due to 
discrimination if Student Senate had 
rescinded its condemnation of that ac
tion?
I would like to thank Student Senate 
for rejecting this latest attempt to cloud 
the ROTC issue. Although I disagree 
with many of SenatorGregHaverkamps 
views, I would like to commend his deci
sion to relinquish the chair so that he 
could voice his strong beliefs on the 
subject. If ROTC draws honorable people 
and hard workers like him to CMU, then 
I sincerely hope ROTC will be able to 
remain on campus without compromis
ing CMUs principles.

Nowhere was there a mention of the

Editor:
I am angered by the 
lack of support that
Student Senate reLetter to 
ceives from the rest of the Edjtof 
the student body. Al
though Senate has had problems in the 
past, I feel that most of the current 
members of Senate are trying hard to 
improve the image of Senate. Many 
changes have occurred in Senate in re
cent months. One of the best and most 
noticeable changes is the budget pro
cess. I commend former Funding and 
Recognition (F&R) Chair Dave Martin 
and all members of the F&R committee 
who helped make this process faster and 
more efficient. With the improved bud
get process, Senate can more easily en
sure that the Activities Fee will be dis
persed in a proper and just manner. This 
shows that dedicated, hard working 
people can be found in Student SenateAnother sign that Senate is working 
hard for the students interests is the 
shuttle service. Due in part to the harti 
work by the Campus Affairs committee, 
the shuttle service for next year will be 
greatly improved. The improvements are 
as follows:
1) The two buses currently in use will 
be traded in for new models. One shuttle 
bus of the same size will be purchased 
for use on the A route. One shuttle bus of 
a larger size will be purchased for us tin 
the B route. The larger bus will also be 
used for the weekday AB route.
2) The older van used for escort will be 
traded in. One new van nearly identical 
to the white escort van now in service 
will be purchased. Due to the high de
mand for escort service to Squirrel Hill 
in the early evening, the idea of using 
the smaller shuttle bus for escort service 
during these times is also under consid
eration.
3) The shuttle schedule has also been 
improved. All shuttles will leave Skibo 
15 minutes earlier than currently sched
uled. This is to allow students time to get

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  26 April 19935
Break stereotypes to achieve equality
Declan IVFCullagh
[Editors note: Declan McCullagh attended the March on Wash
ington this past weekend. He wrote 
this column there and faxed it to 
the Tartan during the march on 
Sunday.]
In northwest Washingtons 
DuPont Circle, a throng of queers 
ringed the entrance to the sub
way, shouting, Take it off, take 
it off! whenever a well-muscled 
man went down the escalator to 
the subway.
At least one hunk obliged by 
removing his shirt, much to the 
chagrin of a police lieutenant 
standing nearby who glanced at 
the raucous crowd and muttered, 
Leave it on, leave it on.
Just a few subway stops away 
in the normally sedate audito
rium of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission, people attending a 
sado-masochism/leather-fetish
conference were treated to a dazzlingarray ofwhips, paddles, and 
other assorted leather goods.
These were the images of the 
1993 March on Washington, 
billed as an event to demonstrate 
the newfound political clout of 
gays. But news reports described 
it less as a civil rights demonstra
tion than a three-day Mardi 
Gras of parties and indulgence.
The limits of even the normally 
tolerant District of Columbiaa 
recent Washington Post poll 
showed District residents as more 
accepting of gays than the na
tional averageare being tested. 
From the hand-holding crowds to 
the mobbing of area hotels and 
restaurants to the t-shirts on the 
streets (an especially popular one 
reads, I cant even march 
straight), activist gays covered 
the city.
These same activists must pay 
attention to the message they 
present to the world, for the me
dia is much more likely to focus 
on a drag queen festival on the 
Mall than a gay and lesbian Bud
dhist bus trip.
Furthermore, antagonizing the
religious right (which has fielded 
groups protesting the march) is 
not the best way to approach ac
ceptance. Acceptance can only be 
found when stereotypes are 
knocked down. Then, and only 
then, can desire be allowed to 
flow unrestricted. Reinforcing 
negative stereotypes en masse is
closing minds before the more 
respectable images of gay and 
lesbian families, lawyers, and 
veterans march by the camera.
Activists mustsharepartofthe 
blame. Led by the militant ACTUPorganization, more than 1,000 
people stormed the offices of the 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Acceptance can only be found when 
stereotypes are knocked down. Then, 
and only then, can desire be allowed 
to flow unrestricted. Reinforcing 
negative stereotypes en masse is a 
step away from that goal.___________
a step away from that goal.
In-your-face exhibitionism, no 
matter how tempting for those 
repressed marchers from the 
more homophobic areas of the 
country, goes against the very 
purposes of the march. It alien
ates the average voter who has 
limited tolerance. Media snap
shots of butch leather dykes on 
Harley-Davidsonsforce the issue,
Association on Saturday, calling 
for political leaders to increase 
AIDS funding.
This sort of civil disobediance 
has a price. Even though the 
motives may be admirableand 
understandable, given the frus
tration of many gays with the 
lack of adequate AIDS funding 
the method is not.
The method is flawed for it invalidates many of the efforts of 
gay rights leaders, who have for 
the first time have found it pos
sible to work through the politi
cal and judicial systems to reach 
their goals.
For the first time, the courts 
have limited the power of the 
military to expel gay soldiers. For 
the the first time, a President has 
openly met with gay activists. 
For the first time, the idea of gay 
rights has entered the discourse 
of mainstream America.
This is the path the gay rights 
movement must take. Now that 
institutions have started open
ing their doors to gays, activists 
should not risk them closing again 
by fighting against the same or
ganizations.
Gay rights groups can accom
plish this by working within the 
system, by not alienating large 
portions of the voting public, and 
by not reinforcing negative ste
reotypes. Only through concilia
tion, not confrontation, can their 
goals be met.

The highly publicized rapes this year 
have again brought attention to a serious 
campus problem that faces women. It is 
certain that the only person responsible 
for the crime of rape is the rapist, but 
stopping rape goes beyond that idea.
The campaign by Stop Rape and the 
Womens Center is trying to make a dif
ference but is missing the mark. The full 
page ad placed last week in The Tartan 
contains one of several stories that have 
been published during the last several 
years. The problem with the campaign is 
that it seems in large part to change the 
situation mostly through sharing stories 
so that men might see the horror of the 
crime from the perspective of the victim.
The sad truth, in my opinion, is that 
education of men has only limited poten
tial for stopping rape. It is unlikely that 
someone with the mentality to carry out a 
rape will listen to someone tell them that 
it is wrong, particularly for situations of 
date rape and acquaintance rape. 
Those who might commit such rapes will 
only be discouraged from committing the 
crime if there is a high likelihood of being
severely punished. That obviously will 
only occur if they are prosecuted, some
thing especially difficult for the type of 
incidents that appear to be occurring on 
this campus.
Except cases of attacks by strangers in 
isolated areas, every story of rape that I 
R.D. Quinn can remember being told on this campus 
has involved either the careless regard for 
ones own personal safety or the inability 
to make the necessary decisions after an 
attack  two things that can be solved 
immediately through education. However, 
it seems that womens advocacy groups 
want to en-I am outraged that it is more 
important to maintain a femi
nist political ideal than protect 
the women of this campus.
sure at all 
costs that 
the woman 
is por
trayed as 
the victim
with no re___________________________
sponsibility for the rape.
I am outraged that it is more important 
to maintain a feminist political ideal than 
protect the women of this campus. The 
story told in the recent ad makes the 
womens choice to take precautions seem 
somewhat trivial because it fails to pro
tect her. It gives the false impression that 
nothing can protect women, yet the ac
tions initially taken by the woman in the 
account would have helped many of the 
women depicted in past accounts of rape. 
No doubt the precautions will help countless other women on this campus. There is 
definitely a responsibility for protecting 
yourself. Taking precautions clearly will 
eliminate many cases of date and ac
quaintance rape on this campus.
We are all responsible for our own safety. 
If we do not enforce the idea that it is our 
individual responsibility to help ensure 
our own safety, then women will continue 
to be victimized on this campus. There are 
a few simple guidelines that need to be 
followed, yet they are not being said with 
the forcefulness that is needed.
Such ideas are limiting drinking so that 
mental 
functions 
are never 
impaired, 
never allow
ing someone 
you just met
___________________________ to be with
iyou alone, 
and never allowing any situation that is a 
potential threat to your safety to continue 
no matter how well you think you know 
the individual. This is what needs to be 
printed in three-inch-high letters, not just 
STOP RAPE.
If precautions do fail, then it becomes 
important to take steps to prosecute the 
rapist. There is a need for a campaign to 
educate women on the steps that should 
be taken after an attack. Such an emotion
ally devastating crime often leaves the 
victim confused. However, if the correct
steps to take after an attack are con
stantly reinforced on campus, then if an 
attack occurs, it is much more likely that 
the correct steps to ensure prosecution 
will be taken by the victim.
Our judicial system works on the idea of 
innocence until proven guilty. Unfortu
nately this leaves the victim of rape with 
the burden of providing the proof. It is 
therefore of vital importance that women 
be encouraged to file charges. A potential 
rapist will not be deterred by the words 
STOP RAPE printed on a poster.
Society can protect our interests through 
law enforcement and the creation of safe 
environments, but we must bear the bur
den of taking reasonable precautions. 
There are hard and fast rules to protect 
yourself from many crimes  rape is no 
exception. There are no guarantees of 
safety no matter what precautions are 
taken, but the effectiveness of those pre
cautions should never be underestimated.
Over time, the current campaign by 
Stop Rape and the Womens Center will 
have an effect of changing certain mens 
attitudes but only a few and only over a 
long period of time.
The issue now is to educate women on 
how to protect themselves  to enforce 
the idea that your own intelligence is the 
most effective weapon against the crime 
of rape on campus.
R.D. Quinn is a senior civil engineering 
major.Police force does not always equal excessive brutality
__________Jason Heinlein
With all of the publicity about 
the Rodney King trial, the public 
i? starting to get a one-sided view 
of the police and their use of force 
in arrests. People also assume 
that all physical force used by 
police officers is brutality. The 
heating of Rodney King was no 
doubt brutality, and the officers
involved overstepped the line that 
divides justified force from bru
tality. However, because the inci
dent has been so heavily publi
cized, people have become too 
anxious to scream police brutal
ity if they witness an arrest 
where physical force is used by 
the police. Even if the force being 
used by the officers is justified 
and reasonable, they do not re
ceive the support of the citizens 
they are protecting by making 
the arrest. All police officers do 
not deserve to be distrusted or 
disliked just because a few indi
viduals abused their authority.
If the public got an accurate 
representation of the violence 
that occurs, it would see that a 
vast majority of it is directed to
wards the police rather than to
wards the suspects. Statistics 
affirm that force is necessary 
during many arrests. According 
to Sergeant William Ricci of Cam
pus Police, there are more than 
150 law enforcement officers 
killed and350,000assaul ted each 
year while performing their du
ties. With such an incredible num
ber of assaults and murders each
year, the police have no choice 
but to protect themselves.
One of the main problems that 
the police have when arresting 
someone iB that they do not know 
ifthesuspecthasweaponsorisa 
skilled fighter. In addition, the 
police have rules that dictate how 
they can go about arresting the 
suspect. The suspect has no such 
rules, and he can clearly see what 
weapons the officer is carrying. 
Already, the officer is at a disad
vantage in the situation.
For this reason, it is manda
tory that the police officer reLetters to the Editor (cont.)

DTD president upset 
with coverage of fight
Editor:
The article 
that appeared 
in The Tartan 
(Police re
spond to fights,
Letter to 
the Editor
close Quad, 4/19) included an
inaccurate account of the fight 
that occurred at Delta Tau Delta 
the Saturday night of April 17. 
The authors of the article, 
Kendrick K Chua, Tartan News 
Editor and Frank Michels, Tar
tan Assistant News Editor, do 
make it clear that their account 
is based upon the Campus Police 
report.
What they fail to acknowledge 
is that the police report makes no 
claim to be an accurate account of 
the events; it is only a compila
tion of statements and observa
tions taken immediately follow
ing the incident.
Statements were taken from 
three members of the band 
Method to Madness. I feel it is 
important to note that members 
of the band faced the possibility 
of arrest if they did not offer a 
denial and an alternative account 
ofthe events. Unfortunately, it is
from the band members defen
sive statements that the article is 
derived.
The only fight participants who 
were not members of the band 
(DTD brother Tom Nelson, a se
nior graphic communications ma
jor, Kappa Sigma brother Matt 
Fowler, a senior history major, 
and Indiana University of Penn
sylvania student Joey Schmitts) 
were unable to give official state
ments because they were taken 
to Presbyterian Hospital Emer
gency Room. If they had given 
statements at that time, the po
lice report and hopefully the ar
ticle would have been much less 
biased.
While I do understand that 
Chua and Michels had no infor
mation besides the police report 
from which to produce a front 
page story, thiB is no excuse for 
sensationalism. The authors took
strainB the suspect as fast as pos
sible so that he or she does not 
have time to reach for a weapon 
or strike the officer. If the suspect 
makes a threatening move and 
the officer reacts, they are only 
protecting themselves from a 
threat that the person should not 
have presented to them. Too of
ten in such situations, bystand
ers complain that the force used 
by the officers was excessive. They 
do not see the times when a less 
controlled arrest results in an 
injured or dead officer.
Please see POLICE, page 8
a one-sided police report and 
stretched it a little bit further. It 
was irresponsible to disregard the 
negative effects that their sloppy 
journalism might have on Nelson 
and Delta Tau Delta.
How is it that two freshmen 
hold the positions of News Editor 
and Assistant News Editor? I feel 
that a more mature student with 
a better understanding of this 
campus would not have made the 
same mistakes that Michels and 
Chua did.
Writing for The Tartan is a tremendouB opportunity for CMU 
students to gain experience in a 
real-world situation. I encourage 
all responsible students to con
sider joiningThe Tartan staff next 
semester.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  26 April 1993Forget the University Center, try this
Christian M. Restlfo
Well, its the end of my four years here 
at Carnegie Mellon. Like Jason 
McDonald, my columnist-idol last year, 
Im here in The Tartan office on Sunday 
morning, trying to overcome a bad case 
of writers block when I should be laying 
out pages.
I was going to whine one last time 
about how this place sucks, how the 
administration has the energy of a slug 
on Valium, and how the College Repub
licans will always be nothing more than 
a Pat Buchanan fan club. But, as Pete 
Berger pointed out to me one day while 
I was talking to him in The Student 
Union office, thats been done before.
So Im just going to take some space to 
talk about what I think Carnegie Mellon 
needs. President Mehrabian, if youre 
reading this, please take it to heart. 
Take all that money that were supposed 
to get for a new university center and a 
center for the performing arts and do the 
following with it:
First, get the Village People to come to
Carnival next year. As I understand it, it 
would have coBt us about the same 
amount as for Live. Id like to see Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy dress 
up as the leather-motorcycle guy for the 
Dress As Your Favorite Village People 
Person contest. Just think what it would 
be like to blast Body, body, wanna feel 
body? all over the Cut.
Next, pay for a giant paintball contest 
that would run all over campus for an 
entire week. Such an event might actu
ally encourage people to wake up for 
that 8:30 class. Make everyone worth 
one point, except for Student Senators 
and the Student Government President. 
They should be worth 10 points and 100 
points respectively. The winner gets a 
free chaperoned trip to New York with a 
gueBt.
Speaking of chaperoned trips for ma
ture college e-tn^~-uf p^-Mu give SDC a 
bunch of money to have an awesome 
Suitcase Dance. The winner wouldnt 
*tuget a hotel room for the ~H\rfor 
two. The person would also receive a trip 
for two to any city in the world and stay 
at the fanciest hotel there.
Next, let students repair and improve 
Skibo themselves. Im sure with all the 
mechanical and civil engineering ma
jors at this school, we could do a fine job. 
(Chemical engineers would have to be 
excused since we do real work thats
important.) All the school would do is 
provide the necessary materials (and 
money for compensation). Beer taps in 
every student office would definitely 
encourage a more active campus. It might 
even make Senate meetings a tad more 
entertaining. Maybe CIT Senator James 
Brown should look into this.
Try funding Citizens for Apathy. We 
had an excellent Picnic for Apathy a few 
weeks ago, and we even cooked a ham
burger for the president himBelf. Were 
having another one the last day of classes 
at 4:30 pm, and this one will be even 
bigger. The concept itself is so simple as 
to be almost pure genius: Students are 
apathetic about getting involved. There
fore, get them involved in something 
that they all share  not caring. I think 
a picnic a week would definitely be in 
order.
Instead of having things like the game 
room in Skibo, put Sega Genesiss and 
Super NESs in the dorm lounges with 
big screen TVs. In addition to the annual 
trivia game that the Housing Office 
hosts, we could hold X-Men and Mario 
tournaments. Naturally, people would 
have to bring their own controllers, but 
they could check out games with their 
IDs.
In addition to the TVs, buy some VCRs 
for the lounges. I know there are prob
lems with this idea, but maybe you could
lock the items up, and students could 
check them out.
Buy Scotland Yard a liquor license. I 
like to have a Ross just as much as the 
next guy, but it would go really, really 
well with some rum. As it stands, youre 
reduced to getting a Robb to go or bring
ing your own rum. (Ive never done this.) 
Just a word of warning: Students get 
pissed when the Yard runs out of onions 
and straws (which seems to happen a 
lot). Comingup short on Iron City beeris 
definitely not conducive to a happy crowd. 
On the plus side, though, it takes so long 
to get your order that a person really 
cant get drunk and cause problems.
Buy artificial fertilizer that doesnt 
smell. Physical Plant usually puts down 
the stuff when its freBh enough to give 
off steam in the morning. Youd think 
they pulled it right out of the horse. 
Anyway, the smell isnt that great when 
youre carrying your donut to class. How 
about some that smells like roses or 
coffee? Im sure theres a way to make it 
so.
Install a closed-circuit TV system on 
campus that feeds into every room. That 
way, when the president decides to keep 
the school open despite the fact that 
every other school, business, and gov
ernment agency is closed due to a small 
blizzard of the century, I can attend 
class through the miracle of modem
technology. Hell, I could even tape the 
thing andleamatmy own pace. Granted, 
I couldnt bring the tapes to an open note 
test, but rewinding allows to me to go 
over what I missed.
OK, OK, so some of these ideas are 
kinda screwy. But I know that you read 
at least one of them and said to yourself, 
You know, thats not such a bad idea. 
Admit it, implementing only one or two 
of these would move up the student 
satisfaction ranking ladder from num
ber 1567 to 1432.
Thats about it for my suggestions on 
how to improve the campus. Hopefully 
when I come back to campus in 10 years, 
I can hear students talk about getting 
drunk at the Yard, going to the Village 
People karaoke contest, and winning 
the X-Men Sega Marathonall thanks 
to the time made available by taping 
their classes.

POLICE, from page 5
There are very specific rules 
pertainingtojustifieduse offorce 
by police officers. According to 
Ricci, who is also certified by the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
as a defensive -,m-Hme H~u-btm-kb 
for municipal police, the use of 
force by the arresting officer must 
be only enough to stop the action 
used against them and control 
the suspect.
Furthermore, the suspect ini
tiates the use of force and the
officer gauges his or her reaction 
by this resistance. As the resis
tance of the suspect decreases, so 
must the force used by the officer. 
Police officers are trained not to 
let their anger influence their ac
tions, and they are not supposed 
to issue any punishment to the 
suspect. However, when a sus
pect initiates a confrontation, the 
officer has the right to use appro
priate force.
Many of the complaints about 
police brutality are due to mis
conceptions about the authority 
of the police and an incomplete 
view of the situation leading up 
to the arrest. An arrest where the 
officer throws the suspect on the 
ground and handcuffs the person 
might seem brutal if the by
stander had not seen the prelimi
nary confrontation when the sus
pect beat and robbed an old 
woman and then attacked the 
arresting officer.
The incidents leading up to an 
arrest indicate the force that the
officer is justified to use. There
fore, if the Buspect leaves the of
ficer no choice, the actions are 
totally justified.
As bad as it is for a police offic
ers to overreact during arrests 
and injure suspects, it is even 
worse for them to underreact and 
put their own lives in danger. 
Ricci told me about an incident in 
Miami where the police were ar
resting a man and woman for 
drug possession. The officers ap
proached the man with caution,
quickly arrested him, and hand
cuffed him so that he could not 
injure the officers.
When they attempted to arrest 
the woman, however, they were 
less forceful and did not get her 
under control quickly. The woman 
slashed one of the officers with a 
razor, cutting through his vocal 
chords. However, if bystanders 
had witnessed a more forceful 
and controlled arrest, they would 
have complained that the officers 
had used excessive force.
Such incidents are not nearly 
as publicized as incidents involv
ing the mistake of an officer, so 
the public is wrongly led to be
lieve that the police are the en
emy. We must remember that 
the police put their lives on the 
line for us every day, and we 
must not lose faith in them sim
ply because of the actions of a few 
bad officers.

Mens track team wins UAA title
CMU ties University of Rochester for championship in St. Louis
PRESS PASS
By Paul Platosh
Playoffs remain undecided
It all started 100 years ago 
when Lord Stanley of Preston, 
Governor General of Canada, 
donated what was later to 
become professional sports 
oldest trophy  the Stanley 
Cup. The men who have held 
that cup are legends; Gordie 
Howe, Maurice Rocket
Richard, Mike Bossy, Mario 
Lemieux  the list goes on. 
Their names are immortal, 
etched in silver memory.
And this year, the race is on 
once again. The quest for the 
Cup has begun with a 
vengance, and already, the 
fates have predicted a Pen
guins three-peat. This year, the 
Penguins sacrifial lamb came 
in the form of the New Jersey 
Devils. But the outcome of that 
series is no surprise. All the 
surprises were left for Boston.
If Sam Adams were alive 
today, hed be getting drunk on 
his own brew. The Bruins were 
hot, riding the crest of an 
winning streak in the regular 
season. Their opponent, Buf
falo, entered the playoffs on the 
verge of tying the clubs alltime losing streak. But when 
the puck hit the ice in game 
one, the Sabres never looked 
back.
Oh poor, poor Raymond 
Borque. Arguably, Bostons 
best, definitely one of the 
NHLs premier defensemen, 
but a man destined never to 
drink from Lord Stanleys cup, 
never to wear the ring. The sun 
is setting on Bostons old guard
 Borque and Cam Neely and 
I wonder if a trade is in the 
Bruins future.
Meanwhile, Buffalo is exhila
rated by their sweep. It was a 
typical ultra-physical Adams 
division series, but Buffalo got 
the better hand. And who 
scored the series-winning goal? 
None other than Brad May.
Mr. Ed had a better chance of 
scoring than May.
The BostonBuffalo series 
showed me something I havent 
seen in a long time  old-time 
hockey, playoffs a la The Broad 
Street Bullies. No-nonsense 
hockey. Adams hockey. Living 
in Pittsburgh, the city of 
Jaromir Jagr, we dont see that 
very often. Hockey has become 
a sport of superstars rather 
than a sport of supermen. Not 
that I blame Jagr for the 
direction that the sport has 
taken, but to quote Hockey 
Night In Canada host Don 
Cherry, Jagr is everything 
that is wrong with hockey.
But, it aint over yet. Pitts
burgh, hear me now! Watch 
out for Montreal. I am looking 
for a stand-up performance by 
Patrick Roy, combined with an 
outstanding offensive display 
from a large group of forwards. 
The Habs have pulled it off in 
the past, and they can do it 
again. And Vancouver still 
looks like a strong contender.
The finals and the champion
ship will demonstrate some 
exciting hockey. Look for lots of 
checking, and tight bluelines. 
The Cup is up in the air, and 
the Pens feel the pressure of 
being expected to win.
There is a fat lady in the 
horizon for Pittsburgh, but will 
she sing this year?

On April 24-25, the Tartan track team 
competed in the UAA championships 
which were held at Washington Univer
sity ofSt. Louis. The mensteam tied the 
University of Rochester for the UAA 
title. Both teams earned 116 points. 
Emory was third with 107 points.
Last season, the mens team finished 
in third place under coach of the year 
selection, Gary Meckley.
While this years team finished bet
ter, coach Meckley and his staff were 
again voted the staff of the year in the 
University Atletic Association. The other 
coaches on Meckleys staff is Dario 
Donatelli, Ken Hallinen, Roslyn Hall, 
and Annette Ediger.
On the womens side, the Tartans fin
ished sixth. Emory University was the 
champions with 114 points, followed by 
Brandeis University with 106, and the 
University of Chicago and host Wash
ington University who tied for third 
with 81 points.
The first day of action saw freshman 
Dawn Balazs set a school record in the 
javelin. Her throw of 118 feet 7 inches 
was good enough for first place. Team
mate Jenny Gretz, a junior, was sixth with 
a throw of 104 feet 7 inches.
In the shotput, junior Mary Moore was 
third with a throw of 34 feet 5.75 inches.
In the mens javelin, freshman Marty 
Wick was second with a throw of 177 feet 
3 inches, senior Jim Hodges was third at 
174 feet 6 inches, and Shigehiro Kanaya 
was sixth at 158 feet 3 inches.
In the mens shotput, sophomore Jason 
Grusky was second, throwing 46 feet 9

inches, and freshman Demi Carrothers 
was sixth with a throw of 43 feet 4 inches.
In the mens longjump, freshman Kenny 
Pugh was second with a jump of 22 feet 11 
inches. Junior Brandyn Woodard was fifth, 
setting a personal best of 21 feet 9 inches.
In the preliminaries of the womens 400- 
meter intermediate hurdles, freshman 
Missy Baustert set a school record of 
1:06.46. This broke her own record set a 
few weeks ago.
She was the favorite going into action
on Sunday. Baustert has already set 
school records this year in the 66-meter 
hurdles, 100-meter high hurdles, and the 
800-meter run.
After the first day, Washington Uni
versity led on the mens side with a score 
of 41. Carnegie Mellon University was a 
close second with 34 points.
On the womens side, Brandeis was 
first with 28 points, Chicago second with 
23, and Emory third with 19 points. The 
Tartans were 
fourth with 17 
points.
Baustert had 
a sensational 
second day 
with two first 
place finishes. 
In the 100- 
meter hurdles, 
her time of 15.7 seconds set a new school 
record. She broke another school record 
in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 
1:04.91. This was 1/100 of a second off the 
NCAA qualifying time.
Coach Donatelli praised the efforts of 
his womens team. Every person that 
went turned in either a personal best or 
seasonal best. I cant ask for anything 
more than that. In many cases, their 
performances far exceeded my expecta
tions, said Donatelli.
The mens team had ono first place finish. 
Freshman Mike Rea won the 800-meter 
with a time of 1:56.27.
There were a number of second and third 
place finishes to enable the team to win the 
championship. Sophomore Jim Filicko was 
second in the 100-meter dash in a blazing
11.02 seconds. Freshman E.J. Tsangaris 
was second in the discuswith a distance of 
140 feet 7 inches. Junior Deron Haley was 
second in the 110-meter high hurdles with 
a time of 15.15 seconds. The 4xl00-meter 
relay team offreshman Kenny Pugh, junior 
Jarrod Siket, senior Chris Maguire, and 
Filicko finished second with a time of 43.12 
seconds.
Pugh finished third in the triple jump 
with a distance of 42 feet 11 3/4 inches. 
Senior Sean McDowell was third in the 400- 
meter hurdles, completing it in 55.07 sec
onds. The 4x400-meter relay team was also 
third with a time of 3:12.97 seconds. The 
team consisted of freshman Erik Thomp
son, senior Andy Helms, MacDowell, and 
Siket.
Donatelli was exhilirated by his teams 
performance.
It ws an entire team effort that won the 
championship for us. Almost every partici
pant scored in the meet. In every race, evory 
jump, and every throw, no ono gavo up, 
said Donatelli. Meckloy was unablo to mako 
the trip due to an illness.
CMU teams experience up-and-down week
Lacrosse team Tartans golf team wins Engineers Cup Tournament 
defeats Bethany
On Friday, the womens team defeated 
Bethany College 9-4. The first half saw 
both teams trading goals, keeping the 
game close. Early in the second half .with 
CMU leading 6-4, freshman Astrid Rapp 
was injured, twisting an ankle. The Tar
tans responded with three goals in a span 
of two minutes. Bethany battled hard but 
was stymied by the goalkeeping of sopho
more Beth MacDonald, who made a num
ber of good saves. The womens team has 
had a very short schedule, two games to 
be exact. Tomasina Choi, a junior who is 
the teams representative, talked about 
this.
Due to our insufficent budget, we are 
unable to pay referees for games. Most 
our our funds goes to uniforms and equip
ment. We have a lot of new players come 
out each season to learn and play, said 
Choi. We plan, along with the mens 
team, to file a petition for varsity recogni
tion. There is a womens league in Ohio 
and Virginia that we can join.
Bethany has requested a rematch, and 
with such a short schedule, the Tartans 
might oblige. The teams record stands at 
2-0.

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  26 April 1993J---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Penguins success part of NHL cycle
By GARY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
Oh, how the times change in the world of profes
sional hockey. It may seem like long ago to most of 
you, but for we few proud souls who have lived in 
this town since birth, it was only a few years ago 
that the Pittsburgh Penguins were sitting out the 
playoffs with regularity.
In fact, it was 1990. The Edmonton Oilers were 
in the midst of taking home another Stanley Cup, 
and who was left at home, hoping and praying that 
someday they would have that honor? Well, among 
the five teams who missed the playoffs, Quebec, 
Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Vancouver were four of 
them.
Now, four years later, it is the Oilers who were 
sent home early. And what four teams look to be 
favored to take the Cup? None other than Quebec, 
Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Vancouver. So how and 
why has there been such a dramatic shift in power 
in the NHL so quickly?
The pathB these teams have traveled down are, 
in reality, very similar. Three of them were built on 
one key player and great amounts of ingenius 
moves by the teams General Manager. wUpic around 
1990, all four of these teams were young clubs on 
the rise. But how did they manage to pull it 
together?
Ill start with the classic example: the Penguins. 
As everybody knows, the Pens began taking their 
position in the NHL seriously in 1984 when then 
GM, Ed Johnston, drafted Mario Lemieux.
The team then spent the next six years being 
known for nothing else but the home of Lemieux. 
They made a few more key acquisitions during 
that time, including Tom Barrasso, Paul Coffey, 
and Kevin Stevens, who was actually acquired 
(but not implemented) before Lemieux. Despite 
their talent, the Pens still sufferred greatly.
After a miserable start in 1989, coach Gene 
Ubriacko was fired. And then came Craig Patrick. 
(At this point, the angelB enter in with dramatic 
cries of'Hallelujah!) If ever one man can be held 
responsible for creating a dynasty, that man is 
Craig Patrick. After familiarizing himself with the 
organization, Patrick reformed the Penguins by 
shipping off slackers Robby Brown and John Cullen, 
and stealing Ron Francis andUlfSamuellson from 
the Hartford Whalers. He also signed scoring wizAnd then came Craig Patrick 
... If ever one man can be 
held responsible for creating 
a dynasty, that man is 
Patrick.
ard Joe Mullen. In addition, he went about drafting 
an abundance oftalentin players like Jaromir Jagr 
and Shawn McEachem. He alBO made a brilliant 
move in hiring coaching greatB Bob Johnson and 
Scotty Bowman. Then, of course, came cup number
one. After another _________________________
brilliant year ofmanaging the Penguins,
Patrick set up an
other cup opportunity 
in Pittsburgh. This 
year, he was almost 
able to sit back and 
enjoy watching his 
work of art tear apart 
the league, en route 
to number three.
In the case of the 
Detroit Redwings, the picture of 1990 is a bit less 
clear. They have a great coach in Jacques Demers, 
and a franchise center in Steve Yzerman, but 
beyond that, there is not much to work with. 
However, that wasnt enough for the motor town to 
hang up their hat. They did what any smart, semidesperate hockey franchise would do: go to Europe. 
That year, Russian Sergei Fedorov was runner-up 
for the Calder Trophy for rookie of the year. Soon 
afterward, they added Vladimir Konstantinov and 
Swedish defenseman Niklas Lidstrom, who nearly 
captured the Calder trophy as well.
After an outstanding regular Beason last year, 
the Redwings decided to put a few finishing touches 
on their roster. They dealt for an experienced 
goalscorer in Dino Ciccarelli and acquired the 
highest scoring defenseman of alltime in Coffey. 
This conglomerate of talent outscored everyone 
this year, including the PenguinB, and very likely 
will challenge Pittsburgh come finals time.
The most surprising, but easiest to trace, trans
formation belongs to the Quebec Nordiques. For as 
long as I have known hockey, it was common 
knowledge that Quebec means bad. In 1989, this 
team was Joe Sakic. Thats it.
Quebec then began to take advantage of its 
annual first overall draft pick in a big way. They 
drafted the likes of Owan Nolan, Mats Sundin, 
Valeri Kamensky and of course, Erik Lindros. 
Each of theBe players made little or no impact in 
their first season with (or without) the Nordiques. 
But they were young, and in time, as everyone said,

they would develop.
Then came the deal. In the most lopsided, ridicu
lous deal ever to hit the NHL, the Philadelphia 
Flyers sacrificed 90 percent of their talent to bring 
in young Lindros. Meanwhile, Quebec was awarded
_________________________ Ron Hextall, Mike
Ricci, and Steve 
Duchesne. These three 
ex-Flyers gave this 
young team the 
strength, experience, 
and energy they 
needed to become a 
true force in this 
league. And the best is 
yet to come.
Next year, this team 
will be joined by Peter 
Forsberg. He is considered by many to be the best 
player in the world, outside of the NHL. He, too, 
came from Philly.
The most perplexing case of a bad thing turned 
good is the Vancouver Canucks. Try as I may, I still 
cant understand why they are so good. The one 
element that may have helped them most is the 
weak competition in their division. The Smythe 
division offers the worst display 
of goaltending to be found, with 
the only spark of light being Kirk 
McLean in Vancouver. This has 
helped the Canucks greatly, as 
they specialize in highscoring 
games.
The most obvious change in this 
city has been the presence of Rus
sian forward Pavel Bure. His tal
ent has rubbed off on others, lead
ing to a well-balanced scoring 
machine. Other than that, the 
only major change in this town 
has been maturity. If ever there 
was a place that knew the word 
defeat, it was Vancouver. The 
teams first winning season ever 
came last year, when they won 
their division.
The team did it again this sea
son, and probably will again next 
year, supposing the rest of the 
Smythe continues to show their
apathy towards winning.
So, this may make you wonder whether this 
trend may continue. Perhaps in a few years, we will 
see Ottawa and San Jose battling it out for the 
Presidents Trophy. Well, this will not be the case. 
With the recent slew of expansion teams entering 
the scene, the situation is altogether different.
In the cases above, these four teams were ready 
to make the jump to power four short years ago. For 
expansion teams just getting their feet wet, it may 
be four years before they see a winning record.
Though anything is possible in this league, with 
the young talent assembled in Quebec and Pitts
burgh, these two teams will only get better. In the 
long run, Quebec will win out for sure. Detroit 
should last a few years until their talent runs dry, 
and Vancouver will fall shortly for sure.
As for the non-expansion teams sitting out this 
season, the picture is mixed. It shouldnt take long 
for the Rangers to be back on top of their game, 
especially with newly acquired Mike Keenan as 
head coach. The Flyers are showing potential to 
grow. The Texas Lone Stars will suffer the dura
tion of the 20th century in mediocrity. And, the 
once powerful Edmonton dynasty will go as far as 
their tight-pocketed owners will allow them to.

i
onder if you .knew okt G^b^ ,pp ,b-Hu\44H
back tlien, when you created your greatest works. 
I knew it, I saw it, despite the fact
that you did not see me
you saw a canvas, clean, blank -you could not resist.
With your power and ability, you gave yourself 
a name and face that would never be 
forgotten.
I have never forgotten, despite my endless 
attempts to try.
For it is what you have created that
has affected so much, and so many people.Iused to think that it wasnt 
too much, and could not affect me so.
But I was wrong  so very
wrong.
The more I looked, the more I saw, 
and could take in so many different 
ways - too many to be exact.
Like you I also tried to make it go
away, but it never did, it only
grew more colorfuL
Since then other artists havecome and gone,
adding to the piece, 
but none has as much impact as 
your work.
After all, you had painte the first line -- you h; ' of the blank canvas in front of you first..
You had no second thoughts.
After all, you are an artist.

M(C  JL o story of sexual molestation is one of a clash against bureaucracy: the 
bureaucracy of the Lutheran Church, the legal system, and others. I have basically tried to show 
how the people in my environment reacted to my situation by giving the lads as they were re
corded. Much of the story has been left out (obviously not every detail can be put down), such as 
the constant church council meetings (or should I say fights) over how the situation should be 
handled, so as to not cause harm upon the congregation." What about the harm done to me? I 
seemed to get lost in the shuffle.
What follows below are some of the copious notes, letters, and other pieces of information my 
father compiled concerning my molestation by Pastor Wayne Freund (phonetically pronounced 
"friend" how ironic) of Prince of Peace Lutheran Church located in the South Hills of Pittsburgh. The 
following letter was written by the perpetrator of each of the three incidents of assault.
6.16.1987 BISHOP MAY HAD A MEETING WITH PASTOR FREUND. HE SAID:

At this point, criminal action was decided upon and the necessary channels were followed. The details 
of my molestation were relayed to my attorney, the Assistant District Attorney, another District Attorney, the 
sergeant of police, and two detectives.

Wayne Freund was arrested on 1/14/1988 and a hearing G,u set for 1/20.
My family and I got in touch with the Center for Victims of Violent Crimes and I was assigned an advocate to help 
me with the complexities and trauma of going to court. My advocate was extremely supportive and it was a great 
help to have her explain the entire future court proceedings. Next, my family and I were investigated by Children 
and Youth Services, so they could determine if I was being abused at my house. I felt like I was the one on trial.

I have the deepest appreciation for my family for their unconditional support from the beginning. While I certainly feel that they could ha ve 
handled the situation in a more enlightened manner [gone to the courts sooner, been more assertive with the other people involved, etc.], I think 
they did the best that they could. Molestation was never an issue they had to face so closely and they were mainly looking out for my concerns. 
Without my family and their support, I never would have made it this far in my recovery process. For that, I love them.
In 1989, my family and I received a copy of a letter sent to the new Bishop of the church. This letter was written by the mother whose son 
had been raped thirteen years previously (in another state) by Freund, yet had only just disclosed the information recently. I now know that Freund 
has a previous history of assault on minors, which indicates that he possibly suffers from Pedophilia. This is sad, as current research shows that 
there is little hope to recuperate from such a problem. This leaves him likely to abuse again (although that is no justification). Even though Freund 
was not convicted of all the crimes he committed against me because they were dropped in a plea-bargain (an unfair one in my opinion), he still 
has a criminal record. Hopefully this will help stop further abuse by him in the future, hereby salvaging the life of the next innocent kid.
Because at the time of the court case there wasn't any information about previous assaults, my DA felt it was "too risky" to take the case 
to trial. My father explained to me that the felony charge of indecent assault, which carries a mandatory jail sentence, was dropped. However, don't 
you think that it would have been appropriate for my DA to ask me how I felt about the case? Would I be willing to go to trial and risk being prosecuted? 
However, my wishes were never considered (nor were my parents asked their opinions), and the chance for a jail term went up in smoke. So much 
for justice. At least he has a criminal record now, and has had his Pennsylvania teaching certificate removed.
It is ironic that this April 23 marks the fifth year after Freund was convicted and charged with five years of probation. This article just happens 
to fall on the heels of his release from his probationary period, which I would argue should have been a jail term anyway.
Essentially I want to say to those who have also endured the intolerable that they should not give up. My battle for recovery has taken many 
years, and to some degree still continues today. But as I continue to face the abusive moments in my life, they become easier to accept and I come 
one step closer to regaining my life. In a way, this article allows me to have the final voice. I refuse to run away and feel ashamed.
An incidence of sexual assault, my case being no exception, affects so many different people. Thesepeople, whether they like or not, have 
to deal with such situations (the district attorney, the perpetrator, the families, the congregation, the bishop, etc.). Personally, I feel that most of the 
people involved could have handled the situation much better. To this day, I believe a lot of pain could have been spared on many fronts, especially 
my o wn. While I do recognize that none of people had dealt with sexual abuse before, I am not sure that fact can Justify some of the actions of the 
case participants. Throughout the entire ordeal I felt as if I were the bad guy, that I was the one to piss off everybody, that I was the criminal.
Throughout the entire experience I felt as If I had no voice, and that I was worthless for what I had done. Well, I know better now, and I will 
no longer be silent!! I have a voice and I have convictions. It may be too late to voice them now in order to change the past, but I have the last words
 I have been vindicated.

EP 4bk"
I HE IOTEM POLE is not llic first of the tilings I have 
brought home to liven up our pea-green split level.
Before the totem came a gold painted paper mache' Cupid,
which I tried to string so dial it would hang
from the ceiling in the foyer, which is really just a hallway.
Hut the. Cupid didn't have a loop or hook and when I wrapped 
the rope around his neck he hung from the ceiling as though 
I had just sacrificed him to the gods.
Before him was an old beaten French horn, 
missing its mouthpiece and a few of its keys.
I hung it artistically on the door to the laundry room,
but it fell with a clatter ever)' Thursday, which is laundry day.
Before that, I'd found a shrine of Jesus, an amazing tiling really.
It's plaster of Paris, painted a sinful red, and I imagined 
an old woman who sat in her garage
making shrines from a mold, day in and day out, fingering the inscription,
Save us o lord from the evils of our wrath," 
as though it were a lullaby to her fingers,
giving (hat particular one to a nephew or niece to paim with tiny pots of paint, 
expecting a masterpiece, never knowing that he'd painted the 
whole thing red, even the eyes.
Certainly she never expected it to end up at a garage sale, 
sold for fifty cents.
Mitchell is tolerant. I le has to be.
When we moved into our pea-green split level with 
candy colored wall-to-wall carpeting 
and dark wood paneling
and a kitchen that was done entirely in that terrible gut-wrenching pea-green, 
he promised that wed get the kitchen a new white 
refrigerator, white formica countertops,
and fresh white tile for die floor. Right away, lie said, even before we remodel the bedroom. 
Nine years later, 1 still scramble eggs ever) morning in a sea of pea.
1 bring home the totem and set it on the mantelpiece.
There are bricks above the mantle, the only part of the house that isnt wood paneled.
The totem is a soft wood and it accentuates the bricks well.
The totems an ugly diing. 1 dont care.
When I saw it at the Smiduown Saturday afternoon flea-market amid 
single bookends and miscellaneous car parts, 1 had to have it.
Its only a foot high, not as wide as my hand, and has a pair of wings that span half its length.
It spoke to me.
The masks snarled their lips and
gnashed their teeth at that mess of Long Island women as though it 
wanted to eat them for being ridiculous.
1 knew that the totem wanted me.
Moreover, I wanted him. Me was exactly the type of exotic objet dart Ive always wanted.
1 was so excited driving home I didnt even glance at the Smithtown bull, a 
statue of immense curiosity for local women.
1 didnt remember to look at his huge balls and penis hanging heavy below him, 
bigger than anything Ive ever dreamed of.
Mitchell doesnt look at me when I get home. lies watching basketball.
1 stand right in front of him and put my totem on the mantelpiece and turn around. Mitchell looks 
up at me and asks, Nora, would you move? Im trying to watch the game.
I move.
1 move into the kitchen and start dinner,
a recipe from one of the Courmcts I borrowed from the library.
Its a squash souffle, but I dont have any squash so 
I thaw some eggplant I have frozen from the summer.
Mitchell stretches his way into the kitchen when he smells the food.
I les tall, six-four, almost a foot taller than me.
I le has to duck through the doorway, none of the ones in the house are high enough for him.
When we first moved in he had a welt on his forehead for a week.
Whats for dinner? he asks before falling into his chair at the table.
Summer souffle.
Jesus. Nora. Cant we have some normal food once in a while?
Mitchell's idea of normal food is hamburgers and spaghetti. If he decides 
to be daring he wants pierogies and halushki: 
our last name isnt Kowalcski for nothing.
I realized that I haled Polish food by the time our fifth anniversary came around.
It's good. Really, I assure him.
When I put the souffle down we both look at it expectantly.
Its an odd purplish-black color, misshapen, as though someone had 
sparred with it and won. As we arc watching it, it slowly collapses and 
I cant tell whether the strange slow sigh is coming from it or me.
Mitchell doesnt say a word, lies used to these dinners.
They never turn out to be what 1 expect and I tell myself that 
its because no gourmet ever cooked in a kitchen as ugly as mine.
After dinner on Saturdays Mitchell helps me widi die dishes. Thats so 1 dont 
gel upset when he goes out with his friends. I saw your new thing, he remarks 
of my totem. I dont say anything. Instead, 1 hand him the clean casserole dish 
to dr)-. Mow much? he asks. Suddenly Im defensive.
Theres something special about it.
Fifteen bucks. It was worth it. You cant find things like that for cheap.
I les silent for a few seconds. Well, 1 guess thats not too bad. 
lie doesnt tell me what he thinks of it. lie never does. Listen Nora, 
why don't you go out with some of your girlfriends on Monday?
Because youll have die car.
You can drive me to work and pick me up, that way you can do 
whatever you want during the day. You need to get out, have some fun.
You never go out anymore except to flea markets and garage sales.
Its no good for you. You need people around you.
All right. I dont feel like arguing.
When the dishes arc done he goes out.
I sit on the couch und admire my totem. I decide that it needs a name, so 1 cull him Kiksadi.
It suits him, even though 1 dont know why or where the name came from.
He wants to be Kiksadi, so he is. I listen to the bats landing on the roof.
The television is on with the sound turned down: I just like it for its light.
Mitchell once told me 1 was pretty in the light of the television.
As night falls back 1 get more and more tired, my buck muscles aching and my eyes sandy with sleej 
but Id like to wail till Mitchell comes home. A low woody tune begins to weave me into my dreams 
and I imagine Kiksadis humming me a lullabye as 1 drop off to sleep.

---------------------------------------------------

On Monday I drop Mitohcll off ut work so he can sell some 
insurance and make us some money.
The building he works in has turquoise tiles all over the outside of it.
It looks like the bathrooms in
my elementary school. I wonder what the bathrooms inside it look like, 
whether people think that
theyre on the outside when they have to use them, or maybe the bathrooms arc shingled. 
I sit for a minute thinking about this until someone behind me honks.
Usually Id give them the finger but today 
I feel calm and let it pass.
Ive called Michelle and Lisa, the only two women 1 ever call.
They live in the M-section1 where all the streets begin with ms 
like Manchester, Mapleshade, Memory Way.
We live in the O-scction, on Olive Street.
The M-scction houses arc bigger and better kept than the ones in mine.
But theyre all Lcvittown homes. Michelle tells me to come over for lunch,
that once her daughter Melissa goes off to her
half-day at kindergarten that everyones going to Ladies Bowl.
Id rather stay home admiring Kiksadi and watch the soaps, 
but I told Mitchell Id go out, so 1 do.
I grew up in the P-scction with Michelle and Lisa, although when we were in 
high school I never spoke to either of them.
1 aspired to be like the kids from the north-side of the highway, 
the ones who either lived in huge new houses or beautiful old houses 
with parents who were still together
and bought them expensive clothes and gave them money for ski trips.
Those were the people who were always on the student council and 
got parts in the plays. Those were the guys that I had crushes on.
They didnt notice me though.
All of us development kids were all the same to them.
But 1 didnt want to be like the girls 1 grew up with, so I stopped hanging out with them, 
slopped dressing like them, cut off all my hair. 1 wore skirts all the lime.
1 was noi cool.
1 didnt care. The kids from my section were the scumbags of the school, 
they wore tight jeans and had feathered hair, guys and girls alike.
They hung out in back of the school in the smoke shed.
The popular kids called us shed-hcads.
Most of our parents were single,
and by the time 1 was in eleventh grade half the boys 
1 knew were in jail and half ihe girls were knocked up.
The P-scction doesnt exist anymore.
Too many houses burned down suspiciously or were taken by lhe county,
and the remaining few were bought off by a company that plowed them down and
built condominiums. My mother look her money and moved to Florida.
Michelles house has four bedrooms and she needs everyone of them.
Shes been having kids since she was seventeen and looks ii.
Her hair is bushy and the way her facc juts out reminds me of a wolf.
Lisa is skinny and has long purple nails and 
cant do anything becausc of them.
The way she clicks them sounds like a bird pecking at a window or a door.
They both squeal when they see me, like Im such a close friend of theirs.
Oh my gawd! Michelle draws out her words 
as though shes got caramel in her mouth.
Youse look so goodl Lisa, look at her hair, its so long!
When 1 hear them talk Im happy my mother was from the South.
1in happy that she took the wooden spoon
to me whenever my Long Island guttural came out.
Mitchell grew up farther East in Quoguc
As you gel farther East the accent seems to gel more subdued.
Nora, says Lisa, pronouncing my name Nor-rer,
which 1 dont mind so much,
since shes Lise-er, Your hair looks so good.
I cantbelieve my fuckin eye's!.
This is all they talk about. Hair.
That is, until (he kids come in clamoring for their lunch,
and then I get swirled into the world of diapers, childrens shows,
and the latest in baby foods.
1 his is a world completely foreign (o me, so I wander into (he living room, 
where the television is on at full volume, even though none of the 
children are watching i(.
I sit down and light a cigarette,
something 1 do only when Im around Michelle and l.isa and Mitchells parcnis.
1 watch (he tv for something to do.
A childrens show is on. A huge fat dinosaur is singing, lilllc kids clinging to him 
like mud, singing along. He sounds like hes a cross between 
retarded and gay and I decide that if 1 ever have kids I wont let them 
be brought up by some mentally deficient fag. Maybe Id buy them 
little totem poles instead of dolls and Barbies, let them learn how to 
appreciate art and culture early on.
We go bowling after lunch. All the bowlers are women.
Most arc over forty, doughy, with 
short permed hair. Almost all smoke.
They drink coffee or diet soda, and go after the pins with a vengeance.
Bowling begins as a high school past-tirne on Long Island, 
on dates you either bowl or play miniature golf.
Then, after graduation, it becomes the ladies groups.
No more squealing and hugging boyfriends when
pins arc knocked down, no more cheerleaderish back kicks and
worrying about hair and makeup.
The womens leagues are serious. Words arc biting.
Today Im substituting for Jacky, a girl who tried to
beat me up in junior high. Shes eight months pregnant with her third child.
The team were playing against is all older than us.
The strain of the years we have to look forward to is shown in their down-turned mouths. 
A woman wearing an old Bruce Springsteen shirt glares at me.
Whos she? she barks.
Dont give us no shit, warns Michelle, suddenly lough,
You know Jackys out for the rest of the season.
We said no subs.
We didnt.
The other woman begins to bitch to her teammates.
Theyre already out for my blood.
Michelle waves them off and turns to me.
Dont worry about them," she says.
I wont, I reply with a shrug. I just want the game to be over.
1rn a shitty bowler. In high school I never had dates.
Today each time 1 sec the pins go down,
Kiksadi flashes in my head. When I go up for my turn,
I can hear him whispering in my ear, 
a foreign language that only I understand.
My eyes arc watering from the smoke. He guides my 
thumb straight, holds my wrist to keep from twisting, 
makes sure the ball goes straight. He knows that 
1 just want to hit a pin or two to help out Michelle and Lisa.
They take the game seriously. I bowl a 98.
I know they wont ask me back again but thats fine by me.

an excerpt by Scarlett T. Townsend
v^OU RACK YOUR RED CONVERTIBLE ALONG THE HIGHWAY THAT HUGS THE CUFF. YOUR 
BLONDE HAIR WHIPS IN THE SALTY AIR, AND YOUR RED-TIPPED FINGERS DRUM THE STEERINGWHEEL IN TIME TO THE HEAVY BASS OF SOME ROCK GROUP PLAYING ON THE RADIO. YOUR 
FLAWLESSLY MADE UP FEATURES ARE SUFFUSED WITH THE PLEASURE OF THIS RIDE. YOUR FULL, 
CORAL UPS HAVE BEEN CURVED IN A SMILE EVER SINCE YOU REACHED THE COAST EARLY THIS 
MORNING.
Each turn takes you dangerously close to the guardrail, that 
thin strip of metal which is your only protection from those hungry waves 
pounding the base of the cliff. You take a wide berth around a turn, 
crossing into the other lane and nearly colliding with a station wagon 
coming the other way. You spin the steering-wheel deftly, easily 
ou[maneuvering the larger car. The irate mother blares her car horn as 
from your rearview window you watch her stop to see if her children are 
all right. Your laughter mixes with die calls of the seagulls whose nests in 
the cliffs above youre disturbing with your wild ride.
You reach die top of the cliff and the clear five mile 
straightaway that leads to the cottage at the end of the road. To your 
right, at die far end of the cliff, you see the lighthouse and wonder if Julia 
is sitting up there sketching the red blur which hasn't stopped to 
appreciate her precious clifls. Pushing the speedometer to 95, you 
consume die miles in minutes as clouds of dust and gravel form in your 
wake. Turning the wheels sharply to the left, you shoot into the driveway 
instead of through the banncadc and off the cliff into the Pacific Ocean 
below.
Grabbing the keys from the ignition and the travel bag from 
the backseat, you walk to the front door of the pale blue cottage. You 
insert your key, bur the door is unlocked. Julia is still a trusting fool. You 
drop your bag by the door and call to her. A muffled voice answers from 
upstairs. You pause in the kitchcn to grab a Coke from the refrigerator. 
There arc two new seascapes in the living room. You make a mental note
to persuade Julia to parr v\ath some of those painrings and make some 
money. Otherwise everything has remained the same. The cottage still has 
that open airy feeling that only big bay windows, sunshine and Julia can 
give a place.
You find her, sitting cross-legged on the balcony, staring at die 
sea. When she turns to smile at you, you think for a moment that you see 
pain in her eyes, but the comers of her eyes crinkle in welcome and the 
shadow is gone. Y ou make anodier mental note to find out if shes finally 
gotten over the death of her husband. After seven years, it is rime to get 
out there and find another man, and you can certainly help with that.
Julia stands up, her shoulder-length ponytail bobbing in the 
breeze which plasters to her body the long white, paint-stained shirt that 
used to belong to her husband. She hugs you, and the frailty of her body 
surprises you.
"My God, Julia, dont you eat anydiing?" you say, turning her 
this way and diat to examine her roo-thin body and haggard features.
Julia slimgs. "When I remember. But, Ive been so busy with 
this opening
Opening? What opening?" you ask.
"A friend of mine is opening a new gallery in Seatde, and he 
wants to exhibit my work. It was a tough decision, bur I finally decided to 
go public."
"Its about time you shared this wonderful work with everyone 
else," you say, gesturing at the stacks of paintings in the studio behind

---------------------------------------------------

both of you.
"Well, Kevin thats the guy who owns the gallery can 
be very persuasive," Julia says, blushing.
"Oh, I think this is something I need to hear, but first 1 need 
something to eat. Is that place with the excellent seafood bar still open? 
I made reservations when I heard you driving up the cliff 
road. Let me find something with a few less paint stains. Julia walks to 
her bedroom, but stops and turns around. "I almost forgot. Your 
suitcases and trunks arrived yesterday. Everythings in your room. Does 
your Latin lover know you made off with the family silver?
"Its a small amount of compensation for the pain and 
suffering I went through"
"Got dumped again, Grace? Julia laughs impishly.
"For some nineteen-year-old, melon-breasted trollop with no 
sags and no wrinkles. Im getting too old for this business. You throw 
your hands in the air and walk to your room while Julia laughs.
You enter your room and walk to the closet where you know 
that your clothes are hanging. Julia, hopelessly unselfish person that she 
is, had hung everything. You sit at the vanity table where your makeup 
has been neatly arranged. You apply more lipstick and run a pick 
through your hair. Your eye catches the reflection in the mirror of the 
photographs which hang on the wall. They are all of you and Julia in 
various stages of growing up. The family in the pictures is hers not 
yours, never yours.
Youd never known your father. You were the product of a 
diner waitress and a sailor on shore leave. Your mother had as much 
luck with men as you do. It was a blessing when shed driven off the 
cliff one night in an alcoholic fog. You were left alone, but it was too 
late in life for Julias parents to make any positive impressions on you. 
You were wild and headstrong and cynicil when it came to emotions. 
Craving the love you never received at home, you took off at seventeen 
with the first man who showed you any form of affection. Things 
havent changed. Youve moved from man to man over the years; only 
now they are rich enough to give you the possessions you associate with 
affection. Youre really just a professional whore.
And what happens when things dont go as planned? You 
come running home to Julia. Shes been saving you since fourth grade 
when the NEWSARR bully called you a bastard in the school yard and Julia 
jumped into the fight to help you. At fifteen when you went to that 
back street butcher for an abortion, it was Julia who found you and 
saved you from bleeding to death. Every time you screw up, shes there 
to repair the damage.
But, what have you ever done for her? You weren't even 
around when the yacht was caught in the sudden stonn and swept 
against the rocks. You were partying in Paris when the hull splintered, 
smashing Julia against the rocks and sweeping her husband out to sea. 
You returned from another broken affair to find the cottage dark and 
empty. A neighbor told you about the accident. You rushed to the
hospital to find Julias badly broken body slowly mending. Shed been 
in a coma for a month and showed litde sign of ever waking again.
With her family gathered around her, youd felt like an intruder until 
her mother had stretched her arms around you and held you while you 
cried, rhcy were the first tears youd ever shed for a person who wasn't 
yourself.
To give you some credit, you did stay with Julia until she 
regained consciousness. You tried to help her deal with the pain of the 
loss of her husband even though you couldnt grasp the concept of love 
yourself. You encouraged her to renew her interest in painting, helping 
her to rum the upstairs into a studio and buying her first painting. You 
even dragged her off to Europe for a vacation. Your guilt knew no 
limits. But, Julia returned to the cottage alone because you found a new 
man in a London nightclub.

JL JLearing Julia talk endlessly about Kevin as she moves 
about the cottage choosing paintings for the exhibition grates on your 
nerves the way running your Lee Press-on Nails down the chalkboard 
during a geometry test used to irritate Mrs. Greeley. To hear Julia talk, 
Kevin is exactly what she needs although she has this crazy notion that 
dating him would be a dishonor to the memory of her husband. Like 
her husband should be enshrined. Youd never really liked him. More to 
the point, hed never liked you. He felt you were a bad influence on 
Julia. Like litde Julia would leave him and run away to Europe with you. 
Even though you could have fixed her up with a duke or a count, she 
would never have left him. Besides, she had no reason to leave him. He 
loved her as much as she loved him.
Oh, you were so jealous. You fled to New York shortly after 
die wedding, determined to find a permanent relationship. You woke 
up a month later in a Las Vegas hotel room with a five carat rock and a 
gold band on your finger and a fat, hairy snoring creature you called Big 
Jim on the other side of the bed. You slipped out of bed, tripped on 
the empty tequila bottles and nearly put a needle through your foot.
You checked your arm for needle tracks but didnt find any. You 
breathed a sigh of relief. After all, a girl has to have some scruplcs. You 
slipped into a dress and began to shove the most expensive articles of 
clothing and jewelry into a suitcase. Two hours later, divorce decree in 
hand, you were boarding a plane for Europe. Youve never made that 
mistake again. As long as you keep your distance, regard men as objects 
to be desired and discarded, and never become emotionally involved, 
youll be fine. Its a philosophy that works.
You thought youd gotten over your jealousy when you came 
to terms with the fact that you were never going to live happily-everafter. Well, at least you believed youd come to terms with your 
jealously, but youve only buried it. It has burrowed into a murky corner 
of your subconscious where it festers with those two or three other stray 
thoughts, products of weak moments of self-awareness.
You try to compensate for your feelings by dirowing yourself

---------------------------------------------------

into preparing Julia for die opening. After much coaxing, you manage 
to get her out of the studio and on to the clifl where she had once loved 
to walk. On the rocks at the base of the clifl, Julia tosses bread crumbs 
to hoveling seagulls as the salty spray settles on her face and hair. The 
sun and exercise make her skin glow. You even persuade her to go 
shopping. You choose a royal blue gown which is a perfect foil for 
Julia's complexion and hair. Julia is radiant. However, you make sure 
that she's no match lor you.
Youre quite a spectacle in that black suede sleeveless minidress which barely makes it to mid-thigh (you'd had salad lor the last 
three days so you could fit into it). You flirt with the ait collectors in 
what you tell Julia is a blatant attempt to sell her work. Besides, you tell 
her, youve never had an artist, and youve decided to find one. On one 
level that is tine. It has been nearly a month since Fernando dumped 
you; it's rime for another man. However, if you concentrate on being 
the center of attention, then you can forget about the couple quietly 
whispering in the comer. You can block out Julia's soft' laughter with 
lippling waves of your own. You lean forward to peer at a painting, 
giving the man beside you a better view of your breasts which arc 
beginning to achc in the push-up bra you're wearing to maximize the 
a fleet of the plunging neckline. It works; you sell your fifth painting. As 
the champagne runs out, you make your excuses to Julia and flee to the 
bed of a prominent ait collector. You are angry and jealous. Once again, 
youve been shown something which you can never have because you 
wont let yourself love anyone.
The morning sun streaming in the bedroom window touches 
the stubbled face of the art collector. You groan at the scrawny body, 
wondering what possessed you to choose this one. You look around the 
room for valuables, but there arent any just tacky home interiors 
from one of diose mail order catalogs. The sheets arent even silk. You 
slip quiedy out of bed and grab your clothes, putting them on as you 
stride toward die front door.
You gun the engine of your convertible, slam it into reverse, 
and back into die street A non-alert driver who wasnt expecting a car 
to emerge from behind the hedge blares his horn and slams on his 
brakes. The cursing, flailing figure soon fades to a small speck in your 
rearview mirror as the speedometer passes sixty and seventy and hovers 
at eighty. You run a hand through your hair, shaking it out in the breeze 
so that it billows around you. You turn up the volume on the radio and 
sing along with a few songs.
But inside, your stomach twists into knots wondering what 
you'll find at the house. Will you have to pur up with gross displays of 
aflcction, or will Julia be sitting on the balcony, staring into the sea, 
hoping for a sign from her dead husband that its all right to marry 
Kevin? You know that no matter how much she loves him, hell only 
bring her pain. Hell leave to recruit some other artist for his gallery, and 
liell never come back. Thats just the way men arc; they cant help it. A 
pair of firm joung breasts with a tight ass walks by, and they arc gone.
Youve learned to handle that type of rejection, but what would poor, 
mcxpciicnccd Julia do? Shell probably sit alone on a damp rock at the 
base of the cliff watching the incoming tide swirl below her dangling 
feet. She might rake the path to the house above before the water began 
to lap around her knees, bur you have no way of being certain. She 
wasnt suicidal after her husband died, bur you were there for her that 
time. You could be in a bungalow in the Caribbean or a chateau in 
France when Kevin finally leaves. By the time you found our, it would 
be roo late.
Determined to save Julia from the pain which awaits her, you 
push the accelerator to the floor, and the speedometer leaps to one 
hundred. Fortunately, its early, and there are only a few motorists 
around which to swerve. Your pace cats up the miles, and soon you arc 
at the base of the clifl once again. Each twist of the road brings you 
closer to the guardrail until you round the last aim before the 
straightaway and the car scrapes against the rail producing a hail of 
sparks. You swerve to the right, barely slowing the car. You must reach 
Julia in time. Doing 110 down the straightaway, you spin the wheel to 
swerve into the driveway, but the tires spin on the gravel. The car 
fishtails, spinning three-hundred and sixty degrees around and then rolls 
forward toward the edge of the cliff. You frantically pump the brakes, 
but the momentum continues to carry you forward. Grabbing your 
purse with one hand, you open the door with the other and dive into 
the grass) bank. The car crashes into the barricades at the end of the 
road and teeters on the edge of the cliff. You just lie there in the grass, 
your mouth gaping open.
It takes several moments before you realize that Julia is there 
talking to you and testing your limbs for broken bones. Julia leads you 
to the car so that she can take you to the hospital, but you refuse to go, 
saying somewhat shakily, "I'm fine, Julia. Just let me go in and sit 
down."
Grace, you nearly died. Im taking you to the hospital."
"Im fine, you say, ignoring your throbbing shoulder. 1 just 
want to know' if you're all right.
What are you talking about? You nearly drove over the cliff, 
and youre wonied about me? Julia said, her forehead wrinkling. 
Maybe you have a concussion. Get in; were going to the hospital.
"No, Im perfectly fine, you say, clutching Julias arm. Your 
blouse is tom; your knee is bleeding; your skiit is grass-stained; and your 
hair is whipping around in the wind. Julia raises an eyebrow and tries to 
push you into the car. "I had to make sure that you didn't marry Kevin. 
Hell only hurt you.
Julia begins to shake you. Snap out of it. Youre hysterical, 
Gracc. She pushes you in the car and fastens the seat belt.
You continue babbling about having to save her from 
committing suicide. She pats you on the hand, saying, Dear Grace, itll 
be all right,

---------------------------------------------------

Y(C ou had bruised your shoulder in the fall, so the 
doctor gave you some pain killers, and, when Julia described your 
behavior, he added some tranquilizers. Returning to the cottage, you 
slept until late afternoon. Wearing a peach negligee, you emerge from 
the bedroom to find Julia preparing dinner. She explains that she needs 
to run to the grocery store for a few things, but that Kevin will arrive 
soon so that you wont be alone. You shrug, swallow some more pills, 
and sit down on the sofa while Julia leaves. You know that Julia will 
never believe that Kevin will leave her for another woman, so you decide 
to prove to her that all men are alike.
You greet Kevin at the door, still wearing your peach 
negligee. He appears a bit stunned, but you know he really wants you. 
After all, doesn't every man? You explain why Julia isnt there and invite 
him to join you in the living room. While walking to a chair, you 
pretend to swoon. He reaches out to catch you, and you clutch his arm 
for support. You lean heavily upon him, pressing your curves against 
him, saying chat the medicine has made you dizzy. He helps you to the 
sofa and then tries to move to a chair on the other side of the room, but 
you grab his hand insisting that he stay beside you just in case you pass 
out. You snuggle up beside him and ask, What you do think of Julias 
future as an artist?
"Shes very talented. 1 think shell go quite far. Kevin glances 
at his watch. "How long did you say until Julia comes back?
"Well, that depends, Kevin. How much time do you need? 
You place your hand on his knee. Ive never needed a lot of time.
Kevin leaps off the sofa and strides across the room Staring 
out the window, he says, "I dont know whac youre trying to do, Grace, 
but youre going to stop now."
Moving softly on your bare feet, you follow him across the 
room. You step in front of him and put your arms around his neck. 
Oh, Kevin, you know exacdy what Im doing. You know exactly what 
you want to do to me. Julia cant even do half the things that I can. I can 
drive you out of your mind."
You lean forward to kiss him, he pulls back, a botde crashes 
to the floor. Both of you look up to see Julia standing in the doorway. 
You react first, saying, "See, Julia, 1 tried to tell you that you couldnt 
oust him, but you wouldnt listen. He made a play for me the moment 
you were gone.
Julia doesnt say anything. She drops the bag of groceries and 
flees out the door. Kevin slaps you, shoves you to the floor and then 
follows Julia. You bump your bruised shoulder on the coffec tabic and 
cry out at the pain which shoots through your arm. You put a hand to 
your throbbing lip and pull it away to find drop of blood on your 
fingertips. You stagger to your feet and reach for the bottles of pills. 
Dumping three of each in your hand, you walk to the kitchen for a glass 
of water. After swallowing them, you pick up a dishcloth and walk to
the puddle of red wine which is scaining the white tile. You kneel and 
begin to pick up the pieces of glass, but your hands arc shaking so badly 
that you cut your thumb. You watch the blood ooze from the ait and 
slide down your thumb until it drops into the pool of wine. You pick 
up another piece of glass and hold it over your wrist, but your hand 
wont stay still long enough for you to open the vein and add more 
blood to the holy wine on the floor.
A car engine roars to life outside. You drop the glass and 
stumble to the window. Kevin pulls out of the driveway, tires screaming. 
And he is alone. Did Julia send him away? Did she finally realize what 
men arc really like? You knew shed see it your way. You always had her 
best interests at heart. You run to the door, but your foot slips in the 
puddle of wine, and you fall backward. Theres no pain this time. You 
try to sit up, but everything is spinning around you. If you could just get 
to Julia, shed make it all better.
You finally regain consciousness in the early hours of the 
morning. Your mouth is dry, youre hungry, and your negligee is stained 
with wine and blood. You stagger to the kitchen trying to shake the 
fogginess from your head. You grab a can of Coke from the refrigerator 
and drink half of it in one gulp. Your stomach rumbles but doesnt 
reject the soda. You pull a package of Oreos from the top of the 
refrigerator and a pint of ice cream from the freezer. You turn away and 
then reopen the refrigerator for the botde of hot fudge sauce. You sink 
into the fluffy pillows on the sofa, clutching the food to your chest.
You begin to eat, your eyes straying around the room looking for Julia. 
She isn't there, but you know shell come soon to save you; she always 
has.
ow you sit there, a pathetic creature. Your hairs 
sticking up all over, and your roots are showing. And your clothes. The 
Lice on your peach negligee is sprinkled with Oreo cookie crumbs, and 
the cuff of the matching robe is smeared with hot fudge sauce from the 
half pint of ice cream you polished off an hour ago. You flip through 
channels on the remote, reduced to actually using the rip of your index 
finger because by now youve chewed off all those fake red finger nails. 
You reach for another Oreo. Picking up the empty package, you stare at 
it for a moment and look around wondering who stole the List dozen. 
Bur, no one took them because you are all alone. Your hand makes a 
fist, crushing the package, and tosses it at the television screen
You stand up and walk to the kitchen. Your bare feet make 
no sound on the thick pile rug. Your toes curl at the coldness of the 
kitchen rile, and your heel crunches somcdiing on the floor. You brush 
it off; its a piece of glass. You begin randomly opening cupboards. A 
can of sour crcam and onion potato chips catches your eye. You rip the 
plastic lid off and pull back the aluminum wrapping. Dumping a 
handful into your palm, you pull a botde of wine from the refrigerator 
and take a drink. Another swallow empties it, and you rub the slick 
sides of the botde against your checks. Leaving the botde on the

---------------------------------------------------

counter, you open anot her cupboard and withdraw a bottle of gin.
Botdc in hand, you walk through the house to the balcony, 
your heel leaving drops of blood on the light blue carpet. You raise a 
hand to shade your eyes from the morning sun. A pair of seagulls circle 
overhead before diving into the surf lor a fish. Do you find the cliffs 
below inviting? You would like to climb up on the white railing, 
wouldn't you? And sec how long you can keep your balance before you 
grow tired and lean forward. Youd like to relax and fly just like those 
seagulls. Fly down to the base of the cliff and sit on that rock beside the 
gull and watch the surf come in, slowly swallowing you. But, you know 
it wouldn't be dial peaceful or pretty. You would turn end over end as 
you rolled down the clifl, your limbs at odd angles until your neck 
snapped or you impaled yoursell on that pointed rock below.
Instead you take another drink and wander back into the 
house. In your bedroom, you brush your arm across the dresser, 
knocking the photographs of you and Julia to the floor. One of the 
frames hits the wooden arm of a lounge chair, and the glass shatters.
You set die botdc of gin in their placc and open the walk-in dosct.
Your hand wanders from silk dress to cashmcre sweater. What will you 
wear today? Should you even bother to get dressed? Finally, you pull a 
t-shirt and jeans from the back of your dosct and toss diem on the bed. 
Sitting at die vanity table, you examine your bloodshot eyes, your tearstained diccks, and j'our swollen lip. Dried blood runs from die comer 
of your moudi to your diin, and dicrc arc streaks of dried blood 
running down your arm from your thumb. You squirt a couplc of 
drops of Visinc in each eye and rub a thick blue cream on your face.
In die bathroom, you turn on the caps and pour bubble bath 
into the tub. You shrug off the robe and pull the negligee over your 
head, smearing the lace with blue cream and dotting your face with 
Oreo crumbs. You step into the tub and sink down, reclining your head 
on the back of the tub. As the bubbles begin to tickle your chin, you lift 
a foot to turn off the water, pushing up first the handle for the hot 
water then die cold. Your foot returns to die bottom causing a wave to 
crash over the side of die tub, soaking your robe.
Your eyes dose, die waves subside. It would be so easy to 
sink down a few more indies, submerging your moudi and nose. But 
could you stay down long enough or would you sit up, gasping, pressing 
your face to the pale blue rile diat lines the wall beside the tub? Between 
your roes you grip the diain diat holds the stopper in die drain and pull. 
You stand up, pull the curtain and rum on the shower. You wash the 
mud mask from your face and shampoo your hair. Stepping from the 
shower, you wring out your hair and wrap yourself in a towel.
Sitting at the vanity table, you nui a hand through your hair 
and wrinkle your nose j'our roots arc showing. Maybe you should go 
to the hairdresser and have your hair colored and styled. It's time for 
new nails, too. Maybe some plastic surgery to firm up everything. And 
after j'our food binge, some days at the gjm wouldnt hurt either.
Youre going to have to look good in ondcr to compctc widi those
younger women. After all, you wont be able to come running back to 
Julia. There's no way shell tolerate you after the way you treated her last 
night. What were you thinking? In the mirror you see the shattered 
pictures on the floor. You walk toward them, kneeling to retrieve the 
fragments of your life. What will happen to you without Julia to pur 
the pieces together again?
You stand up, square your shoulders, take a deep breath and 
calmly walk downstairs. Stepping around the pool of wine and glass, 
you walk our the front door. The twisted piece of metal which used to 
be your car sirs ar the end of the driveway. As your feet make contact 
with the gravel of the driveway, you realize you forgot to pur on shoes. 
You look up and see the lighthouse on the other side of the cliff. That 
lighthouse was always Julias sanctuary. She spent countless hours there 
after she relumed from the hospital, even moving some of her painting 
supplies there. Ignoring the pain, you begin to run.PJL anting and pressing your hand to the stitch in your 
side, you begin the long climb up the curved stairs to the top of the 
lighthouse. There is no railing; the steps arc narrow. You could easily 
slip over the side, and it would look like an acddenL Instead you take a 
deep breath and continue.
Ar die top you find Julia, hard at work behind a canvas. Her 
checks arc stained with tears, her eyes are red and puffy, and her nose is 
blotched with blue paint. She looks ar you, and you see the pain which 
you dioughr youd imagined before in her eyes. Her eyes refocus on the 
painting, and die brush moves faster. You sink to the floor w-aiting for 
her to speak. Wouldn't it be easier to walk through that door and slip 
over that paint-chipped railing, that line of security that prevents the 
occasional tourist from walking off the edge into the churning waters 
bdow?
Still painting, Julia begins to speak. "I know that a good, 
understanding friend would overlook your behavior last night. But, 
Grace, I've been understanding for thirty-seven years. Ive watched you 
screw-up too many rimes to count, and yesterday I thought that I'd lost 
you when 1 heard those brakes squealing." Her voice cracks, and she 
pauses, eyes focused on the painting. "But, I cant be a spectator 
anymore." She gestures with her brush for emphasis, and red paint 
splatters against the w'all over your head. You need help, and 1 cant 
give it to you. 1 know you wont change 1 don't even think you could 
change if you wanted so I want you to leave. Dont worry about 
packing; Ill send everything to you w'hen you get a place. I just want rid 
of you. I don't have the energy to deal with your problems any more." 
Julia finally looks up from her painting. "I dont want to be there w'hen 
you fall.
Tears sliding down j'our dieeks, you saj', I already have."

A Question of Ownership
Jennifer Thorson
Really, I never found her snoring to be so dreadfully disruptive. Certainly not as nerve-twisting as my wifes aunts and mum had made 
it out to be, anyway, and definitely not enough to make me want her dead in itself. On the contrary, once over my initial shock at its sheer 
volume, 1 found the regular gurgling and growling emanating from Elaines aquiline but reddened nostrils to be rather soothing.
Being an only child, and having never gone to university, (it seemed Id always worked front desk of Elaines familys inn), I had spent 
most of my youth feeling Id had most everything to myself, with one crucial exceptionmy parents. From the very beginning, Id shared 
my father with his work. He was a night shift security guard in a small London museum, so when Id be on holiday from school, Id see 
him in those fleeting moments occurring between the time we took our places round the small dining table, and the time he sported his 
uniform and kissed Mum goodbye.
During the day, I had to be quiet, often settling myself down with a murder mysterykeeping company with Dorothy Sayers and 
Dashiell Hammett and the like. While I read tales where the good triumphed, the bad got apprehended or knocked off, and the 
investigator was allowed to make noise about the house, Mum was a filmy nasal voice I sometimes heard underlying plot-lines. She always 
clasped her hands together and exclaimed, David, youre such a good lad I barely know youre here! and then she would put on her best 
dress and top her short hair with one of those bloody feathered hats she saved up for, and trot off to her various charity benefitsfood 
drives and such; even though we werent extremely well-off ourselves, she liked to help the unfortunate families in the city. It kept her busy, 
and out of our tiny flat. Sometimes she and I would sir down to talk if I helped make posters for one event or the other.
Since Id shared my most valued possessions all my life, I was more than willing to bear my wifes snoring, just to have her to myself. It 
was delightfully comforting to know my Elaine was lying there curled up beside memouth gaping open and drooling on her foam 
pillow, or not; I was hard put to think of someone whod wanted to be so very close before.
When I first saw Elaine, the daughter of my employer Mrs. Marjorie Colin-Wood, I felt that I could do nothing but watch her. She
seemed almost perfect in every waythe slender, Ivory-scented beauty with the creamy skin flawed only by the brown freckle on her 
cheek. From the desk, I could sec her there in her sweeping gown, with her dark curtain of hair, as she greeted restaurant patrons, her 
warm soap-like hands quick to extend to Colin-Wood Inn visitors the moment they stepped inside. Each time she glanced my way, I 
would fumble with papers, or direct my gaze downward to one of the novels I kept nearby to pass the quiet time.
After a week passed, Elaine would walk by, lavishing me with smiles, or a quick demure wink. Though in my delight I could barely
rasp out a Good afternoon, Miss Colin-Wood, I didnt dare take her attention as any indication of personal interest, because I knew that 
Elaine just loved people, almost to the point of impartiality. She was a natural, how she could settle a fussy old tabby into an upholstered 
lounge chair with a few gentle words while accommodations were fixed to the ladys liking. How she could make welcome even the most 
garish American traveler, and keep in line the most rambunctious school boy. And as an onlooker, my favourite part was when a problem 
would arise, because Elaine would always cock her head a little to the side as she listened, as if what her patron had to say was the most 
important thing shed heard that year.
I quite forgot how to speak the first few nights when, after she knocked off for the evening, she leaned upon the front desk, propped 
her chin in her hands, and struck up conversation. As I felt the color creep into my face, I would stumble over my words and find myself 
dwelling on what shed said (what Id said) for hours latercringing at my every blunder and wondering how my parents ever sired such a 
introverted dolt. And once I had finally convinced myself I was no more important to Elaine than Cook or James the Bellhop, and that 
speaking to me was merely a way to pass the long hotel hours, one night she took her customary spot on the counter, and said, David, 
were going out to the garden.
We are? I asked.
You look more surprised than if youd been struck on the head. Certainly we are, she said, laughing. Theres a little bit of sun left, 
and its important you get some. Ill not see you here at the front desk day after day, working and reading those books, and never getting to 
be out.
I get out, I mumbled.
You lie, David. She waved an accusing finger, smiling. But its all right; Ill get someone to cover for you and well go see the flowers. 
The lilacs are out, and lilacs are my favorite, you know.
But your allergies, I protested, for at the hotel her sneezes were like miniature earth tremours, and thus, were common knowledge.
What of them? she said with a toss of her head and a quick grin. I dont need sinuses. Im hoping to evolve so as to breathe through 
my ears.
Talcing my hand, she led me out the front door of her familys hotel, and this was the first of our nightly walks. It seemed no matter 
how many times I saw her a day, I was stunned by her quick humour, her attentions. I realised I had turned into a romantic fool, and 
though I was surprised this fine creature found it agreeable to spend some of her time with me, I was even more surprised when I finally 
worked myself up to proposing, and she accepted.
But talk of surprise, good gad, Ill never forget the shock we gave her mum when we brought her into the sitting room and relayed our 
good news.
Married? her mother Marjorie asked. She popped open the bottle in her slender, manicured hand and chewed a few vitamins. 
Marjorie looked from Elaine to me and back again. Married? To each other?
Elaine sighed and rubbed her nose, sniffed. Thats usually the way things go, Mum.
Marjorie placed a hand to her forehead. Gracious, I can feel my temperature rising already. Youre trying to kill me, is that it, Lainie?

---------------------------------------------------

You see Im in weak health, and you wish to rid yourself of me by playing this cruel joke.
Elaine rolled her eyes. Mother!
I put my hands in my pockets and said, I really do love your daughter, Mrs. Colin-Wood.
Oh, David,here Marjorie clasped both my hands in her clammy onesits not that you arent just a fine lad. A very good
worker...
A marvelous worker, agreed Aunt Josie, who shuffled into the room, nibbling a scone. Who are we talking about?
Marjorie struggled not to frown. Dropping my hands, she turned to Elaine. Admittedly it is time for you to settle down, Elaine. Ive
been telling you so all along, but... I couldnt believe my ears when Marjorie rubbed her chin and added, What about Mr. FitzsimmonsBlacks son, Garrett? Hes such a dear boy, and I know hes got an eye on you.
Elaines eyes glistened with tears and she sneezed several times before whining, Oh Mother.
I bit my tongue, hard.
Marjorie turned to face a hung painting. Whats wrong with Garrett?
Nothings wrong with Garrett, Elaine said going over to her, but thats not the point, and you know it.
Finally I said, See here, if its all a question of money...
Over her shoulder Marjorie gave me a thin smile. David, dear, being a desk manager, Im sure you understand that we deal with some
fine families and it just wouldnt do to
Aunt Lillian appeared in the doorway with a gleeful wrinkled grin and conversation ceased. Seeing everyones somber faces she looked 
at her sister Josie, who still gnawed on that scone and asked, What, has David proposed already?
Marjorie gasped. How did you know?
Lillian drew her violet cardigan closer around her. Oh, I assumed it would come to that sooner or later. It usually does. She walked in 
stiffly and took a seat.
Ill get a position elsewhere, I said to Marjorie. Somewhere I can work my way up to higher management.
Oh, Marjorie sighed, and tossed herself into a chair. I suppose if youre going to be so terribly insistent on this marriage thing, it 
must be done, then.
It was, but I was stunned when, after our honeymoon, Marjorie persuaded us to stay on at our jobs at the ocean-side inn. When I 
asked the Aunties about my mother-in-laws miraculous change of heart, they said Marjorie didnt wish to lose her daughter over me, even 
temporarily.
Temporarily? I nearly spilled the tea I was pouring. What does that mean?
Its proximity. Lillian leaned in close to me. She thinks Elaine chose you by proximity, because you work so closely togetherthat 
Lainie loves whoever shes with the most.
She doesnt think Elaine can ever really commit to anyone for long, Josie added, loudly slurping from a cup of tea.
I grinned and helped myself to a small cake. Then my mum-in-lawll be rather put out to learn otherwise, wont she? I wasnt about 
to let Marjories prejudices destroy our relationship; Elaine was too grand a person for that.
Thats why it seemed such a shame this heavenly creature was cursed with such dreadful allergies. Oh, she was allergic to certain foods, 
molds, pollens, freshly cut grass, dust, animal hair, feather pillows, perfumes, certain shampoos, soaps, and brands of make-up. Her 
wedding band made her finger itch and eventually break out, until we learned she had inherited her dads skin reaction to precious metals. 
It seemed the world was too tainted for her.
And uncomplainingly, cheerfully even, each week my Elaine motored to Dr. Gilmour, or one of the other allergists who came and went 
as fast as her tissues, and hed poke that fair skin with injections and prescribe more pills. And still, shed sneeze, wheeze, and sputter, and 
her snoring, as Aunt Lillian warned me prior to our marriage, did rather sound like heavy machinery. Because of this almost constant 
suffering, the poor thing tended to go overboard on her pills unless someone else dispensed them. I was pleased that upon our marriage, 
the responsibility switched from her mums, to mine. I loved her immensely, so I didnt mind that, or the snoring.
But then the murmuring began. Id stayed up to finish the last few pages of an Agatha Christie, glancing over occasionally to see my 
bedside light reflecting warmly off Elaines delicate sleeping features. In my book, Hercule Poirot was just lavishing congratulations on his 
own brilliance for a case well-solved, when I heard a whisper I wasnt entirely sure I hadnt made up. Listening intently, the sound made the 
hair on my arms reach for the ceiling, my breath cut short. Then the sound ceased. It had resembled hissing.
Just when I ran a shaky hand through my hair and exhaled, sure Id have to leave off thrillers to retain the remains of my sanity, I heard 
the dread sound again, and located its source. Very softly, Elaine repeated a single unintelligible word. Though it chilled me no less 
discovering its origin, I found myself listening more closely, leaning in to her sleeping face. Yet again she uttered the word, a chain of it. 
Was she murmuring her own name? I couldnt be certain. I leaned in still closer, sure that as I did so her lids would lift and Id be staring 
into Elaines widened brown eyes. But she only moaned once and rolled over, beginning to snore. This was three days before I decided to 
kill her.
"My, my! You're up and working early today," came Elaine's voice the next morning. I looked up from the Martha Grimes mystery I 
held at the front desk and saw Elaine standing before me, looking glowingly rested and sniffing lightly into a tissue. "Wherever is 
Arthur? This was his shift?"
Managing a grin, I placed my book face down on the desktop. "I told him to go home a little early this morning, is all. Said that I'd 
take over."
"Oh." She frowned and glanced at her wristwatch. "Three hours and four minutes early? Well, Winkie will be quite glad of that."
My eyes must have widened. "His wife's name is Winkie? How absolutely dreadful."
She laughed. "No, silly. His cat, not his wife. Arthur isn't married, though you're not to tell Winkie that. She's queen of the 
household. She's been gnawing on the draperies as revenge for Arthur not feeding her as soon as she likes." Elaine tilted her head a 
little to the side. "Couldn't you sleep, dear?"
"Why? What makes you say that?"
She sniffed and waved a hand. "Why, David, I don't know. You just get up to work early when you can't sleep. It's one of those 
predictable little things you do, like reading here at the desk, or sleeping in until exactly 9:15 on Saturdays. Was it my snoring that kept

---------------------------------------------------

you up?"
Speech got caught in my throat for a moment.
"David?"
I smiled and put my hand over hers. "Of course you didn't keep me up," I found myself saying. "I was quite caught up in my book 
and just had to find out what happened this morning. You know how I am."
"Yes, I know how you are," she said with a warm smile. She patted my hand and went into the restaurant.
The day went on much as usuala regular amount of guests, and Elaine's mood was not a tad less pleasant. As the day progressed, 
in fact, she seemed almost jubilant. Even the thought of going the next day for her allergy shots was not enough to bring her down. By 
nightfall, however, her pills had drained her of most of her energy, and after a long, tender kiss she told me she just wanted to sleep. 
Her medicine wore her out so, it seemed she was asleep before her head hit the pillow.
And then I heard it. The murmuring again. I shivered and wondered how such an inhuman noise could come from such a tranquil 
face. But this time the murmuring rose in volume, and that word I was hearing over and over again was, I discovered, not my wife's own 
name. It was the single word, "Blaine."
Blaine? I gave a start, looking at her peacefully sleeping form in horror and amazement. What or who the bloody hell was Blaine? I 
racked every nook and cranny in my head, most of them filled with the cobwebs of sleep, and for the life of me, I could think of no place 
and no one named Blaine.
Over and over she said the word, nothing more, and when I almost could have excused it, could have pushed it into the far recesses 
of my thoughts, it was uttered in the voice she used when being persuasive, passionate, and seductive. I knew the voice well, and it had 
no business saying the name of anyone but me.
I felt repulsed almost to the point of illness. My Elaine, the only woman I'd ever been completely enamoured with, was gently 
chanting the name of some other man. Some Blaine bastard.
As I sat up in our bed, staring at her slowly moving lips, I wondered when she could be seeing him, this Blaine bastard?
Good LordlI clamped my hand to my mouth, unsure I hadn't exclaimed aloudin my implicit oblivious trust, I had given my 
Elaine generous opportunity. Shopping bored me, and quite often she went alone, driving into the city, spending hours at a time. And 
she'd go for walks round the inn grounds herself. Were these mere excuses for her and her lover to steal a few moments? Or what about 
those supposed trips to the allergist? Did she really go there each and every time she said she did, or was that only another convenient 
excuse to slip out and into the eager arms of this Blaine bastard?
I recalled how she'd mentioned the "predictable little things" I did. Didn't my predictability make things all the easier for her?
The speaking stopped and again she rolled over. It was not until several minutes passed I became aware of how all my arm and leg 
muscles had tensed, that my teeth were clenched together tightly, waiting to hear more than just that damned name. And still Elaine 
slept, blissfully unaware, and began snoring. But this time the snoring was not comforting. Instead it was like one of those electrical 
thingies Aunt Lillian liked to compare it to. Perhaps an incessant weedwhacker, chopping away at my sleep.
I had barely dozed, and by morning, as hazy sunlight filtered through lobby draperies, I was unable to keep the images of Elaine and 
another man from twisting about in my mind.
"David," Marjorie strode down the sweeping staircase with the poise of a film star, and a pill bottle in her hand. "You look like hell, 
lad."
"What? Oh." I offered a crooked smile. "Do I?"
She folded her arms and looked at me through long black lashes. "Up reading again, I suppose?"
"Okay," I said.
"Okay?"
"I meant 'yes,' Marjorie. Yes." The last thing I wanted was Elaine's family knowing Marjorie had been correct in her prediction that 
Elaine couldn't commit to methat I should never have been anything more in their lives than a bloody desk manager.
"Reading all night is a terrible excuse for looking like hell, David," she said. "Now, you know I am just terribly ill, and I still manage 
to fix myself up quite presentably."
I looked at the desktop and wondered whether that Blaine bastard found Marjorie's daughter to be as very presentable as I did.
"You're the first thing we see at the desk, David. You represent us ," Marjorie continued. Her hand motioned gracefully to 
encompass the whole lobby area. "You're a nice looking boy, but I'll not have your curls sticking up like you just woke. That does not 
represent us. Now see that we get presentable."
I had, but from all the tossing and turning, my hair had become nearly as disgruntled as I felt. She opened the pill bottle and I looked
curiously at the little blue tablets she spilled into her hand. "Marjorie, why are you taking Elaine's decongestant?"
"It's not Elaine's, it's mine."
"I didn't know you had allergy problems." The moment I'd said it I wished I hadn't; Marjorie loves to discuss her ailments.
She put a hand to her forehead. "Ah, fortunately allergies are the one thing I haven't become martyr to. These are sleeping pills. You 
might consider taking a few yourself, David. You look as if you haven't slept in days."
"I'm quite well," I said and waved away the bottle.
"Right then." Marjorie shrugged, and glanced at a brochure display on a nearby drop-leaf. "Just straighten up those brochures, will 
you? The Geoffreys' boy made quite a mess of them last night."
Without waiting for an answer, she tip-tapped off in her high heels. I had just made my way from behind the desk to do the
straightening when Elaine appeared in her morning frock.
Somehow she didn't look the same to me. Her skin had always seemed so clear and white, but now I could hardly focus on anything 
but that birthmark on her cheek. Even her Ivory scent seemed unappealing. Ivory boasted to be 99 44/100 % pure, and I'd guessed it was 
that missing 66/100's that had made all the difference in my Elaine.
Elaine's mouth dropped open upon seeing me. "Goodness, Davidl You look as if you hadn't a wink of sleepl Tell me you weren't up 
all night reading those murder books of yours again?"
I narrowed my eyes. "Sometimes it's hard to know when to stop, isn't it Elaine?"
She glanced around at the empty lobby and then stood on tip-toes, planting a kiss on my cheek. I resisted the urge to pull away. She 
said, "Yes, it is hard to stop, sweetheart, but you'll have to learn, or you'll exhaust yourself."
I nodded and gave a slow smile.

---------------------------------------------------

She said, "My allergy pills, dear?"
Walking to the desk, I pulled the two bottles we kept behind the counter and dispensed two little tablets of each into her slender 
hand. One was her regular allergy medication tacaryl and the other was a nasal decongestant, for good measure.
She chewed the pills and gave me a long endearing look, ruffled my hair. "I love you, David," she said, and went to greet a group of 
visitors at the inn front door.
And that was the way she continued to act toward me. No more affectionate than usual, though it seemed each time she kissed, 
embraced, or winked at me she was doing it to allay my suspicions, to wipe away the knowledge I'd heard the repetitions of her lover's 
name.
But no matter what she did, I could think of little else. With trembling, anxious fingers I checked the registry, and found we'd had no 
guests named Blaine, either first or last, male or female. When she was out, I crept into our bedroom like an intruder and ruffled through 
her appointment book, seeing only lunches with her girlfriend Sylvia and the expected allergy appointments. Frustrated, I began to plot
what I'd do if I ever came upon that Blaine bloke. In my favorite scenario, I would calmly stride up to him, hands in my pockets,
grinning, and say, "Pardon me, Sir, but I'm David Graeme. You don't know me, but I believe you know my wife."
His thick lips would form the words, "Your wife?" (for in my scenarios, Blaine was a homely, lonely, conniving man on whom Elaine 
had taken pity.)
"Yes," I'd say brightly. "You're the man who's been poking my wife, Elaine?" And Blaine, taken off guard by my
casualness, would nod, startled. "Well, as a matter of fact, yes, Mr. Graeme, I am."
"She's a sexual dynamite in the sack, isn't she?" I'd ask.
Again, Blaine would blink a few times but say, "Er, why, yes, Mr. Graeme. Most assuredly she is."
"And I suppose you've admired my wife's fine endowments," I'd say.
Blaine would now be truly confused, stammering.
I'd calmly press the matter. "Haven't you?"
Rddd Rddd
Don't tell me you don't find Elaine's body attractive...? Hell, now I'm quite insulted."
"Well, of course I find her attractive. I... I'm sorry. She... she has remarkably firm thighs."
"Now you're not just saying this to make me feel better?"
"Oh no," Blaine would insist. "Not at all. She's got the grandest thighs I've even seen."
"Ah!" I'd smile some more and clasp my hands together. "Right then."
Blaine would sigh with relief, perhaps mop his brow.
"Then you'll excuse me," I'd say, "but I'm going to have to do you some rather severe bodily damage now." I fancied the Blaine 
bastard would either be a bit of a mess by the time I was through, or he'd run off in terror. The ending changed, depending on my 
mood.
Elaine's cheerfulness and general sweetness of nature did not change, however. It was maddening. Each time she said she loved 
me, I wanted to sneer back, "As much as that bloody Blaine bastard you're seeing?" As the day progressed, I began to dread going to
bed at night, both afraid, and curious, at whether I would hear more than just the other man's name come from my Elaine's soft lips. I
contemplated sleeping in one of the other rooms, but that would only alert her family that something was wrong, and bring about 
Elaine's own suspicions.
And admittedly, I was still morbidly curious.
The third night, the bloody Blaine bastard's name took center stage in Elaine's dream conversation and I'd decided to forgo sleep 
altogether, reading one of my many Agatha Christies. Old Dame Agatha had it right in her world, she did. The unfaithful always got 
popped, or caught in the end; it wasn't necessarily a pretty world, but always a fair one. As I read along I just waited for the book's token 
tart to get hers, and by late morning, she'd been poisoned. Cheering, I did a little dance behind the desk.
Of course, Marjorie had happened past and raised a penciled-in eyebrow. "Problem, David?"
"Foot's fallen asleep," I murmured.
"Strange lad," she said and went on her way.
And I began to note how my life had very much turned into an Agatha Christie plot. The setting was righta stately inn on the fells 
of England. The characters were right, too. The wife's intruding, wealthy family. The beautiful cheating wife. And me. Lord knows I'd 
nothing now. Nothing but my books and my job, and any legal separating would undoubtably cause Marjorie and the Aunties to 
promptly sack me. Worst of all, my beloved Elaine was mine no longerhad never been mine, in fact and she hadn't the guts to tell 
me. It was a question of ownership, and a deception of the worst kind. I'd been wrong about her all the three beautiful years we were 
married.
By lunch, when Elaine had got Cook to make me her glorious pot pie and serve it with stout ale (my favourite meal) then sat down to 
dine with me, she rambled on merrily of the shopping trip after her appointment. I tried to hold my head up straight and rub away the 
heaviness in my eyes, and determined that one way or another, it had to end. The facade was the worst of all. Perhaps I would have 
been more receptive to calm negotiation if she had said, right out, she was sleeping with this Blaine bastard. But she didn't, and I knew 
the truth, so in between checking in and out the guests, I'd found thoughts of ridding myself of this chronic embarrassment once and for 
all to start becoming quite attractive. In my fuzzy thoughts I somehow concluded that there was only a single way I could keep the affair 
quiet, retain my dignity, and still keep my job.
For five days I planned, and though I hadn't a good night's sleep any one of them, I had finally been presented with the opportunity I 
longed for. When I saw all the workers bustling, I'd asked Elaine what was going on. It was the day the London Travel Club came to stay, 
(a group of well-to-do couples who traveled about and visited the countryside's lovelier inns). They were yearly patrons, and Marjorie 
had been running about, making sure our maid, Elenore had prepared all the rooms, that Cook had the kitchen running, that the Aunties 
had taken care of the books properly and ordered enough of everything. Really, this day she'd little time for hypochondria.
So, heart thumping wildly, I slipped into Marjorie's room, and strode into the bath. There before me was beauty creams, makeup, 
ointments, and tens of bottles of pills. Back medication, antivert... no, none of these would do. Looking round, I finally found the bottle 
of my desire: sleeping pills. In combination with Elaine's tacaryl, ingesting some of the stuff would be too much for her system; she was 
strictly supposed to stay away from depressants, like Valium and alcohol. I shook about fifteen from the nearly full bottle into my hand 
and promptly deposited them in my jacket pocket, closed the cap back on and arranged things as before.
As I quietly closed the door behind me, I thought how I would be a little sorry to see Elaine's facade drop, for it had been such a

---------------------------------------------------

pretty lie she and I had had together, but I'd determined that one just couldn't go on living with betrayal and it all needed to be over 
soon. I smiled sleepily, feeling I had outwitted both her and that bloody Blaine. Elaine and Blaine... Elaine and Blaine... In my sleepless 
state, I'd begun to resent them additionally because they rhymed.
With an uncontrollable grin upon my face, I returned to the front desk, checked in some guests, and took out Elaine's decongestant 
bottle. My hands shook, as I listened for every sound of my in-laws' approach. But there was a momentary lull about the inn, and 
opening the lid I saw she had but five remaining little blue allergy pills. Aside from a small symbol on the top of the decongestants, they 
looked exactly the same as the tablets of her mother's. I removed them, dug into my pocket and dropped five sleeping pills into Elaine's 
bottle. Hastening through the lobby, I looked round before tossing all unneeded medicine into the rubbish bin outside.
It was done. I sighed heavily, and found myself chuckling, low and effortlessly. How marvelously things would work out. Elaine 
would have to take the two types of pills in the morning, and by the time they kicked in, she'd be on her way to her appointment. I would 
be working at the desk, my alibi being an inn full of guests. An autopsy would show the sleeping pills in Elaine's bloodstream, and after 
some investigation, it would most likely be believed my wife committed suicide. Suicide because her allergies were just too much to 
take. Original, (even a tad silly, I thought, still laughing) but not completely implausible.
That morning, Elaine laid a smooth hand on mine, sneezed, and then said, "David, might I have my pills?"
"Certainly." I opened the bottle.
"No, no," she said, sneezing again and pausing a moment to sniffle into a handkerchief. "I have my appointment today and, 
depending on what Dr. Gilmour says, I'm either going to have the decongestant refilled, or I'm going to try a different kind of medicine. I 
told you this, sweetheart. I said the medication didn't seem to be working. Don't you remember?"
"I suppose I didn't," I said softly.
"You've forgotten quite a few things recently. You forgot about the London Travel Club coming, you forgot about my appointment, 
you even forgot about the Geoffreys' wake-up call this morning. Now I know you haven't been sleeping, so perhaps you should ask 
Mum for some of her Valium. You know you can't go on like this, David."
"I'll be better soon," I said.
Elaine smiled, though all I could focus on was that little black mole on her cheek. It seemed much largerto spread nearly all the 
way across the smooth skin of her face. With a wave, she strode out the front door. A moment later, I'd heard the car's tires roll out from 
the gravel drive.
Things were not going right. She had the pill bottle, and could be taking those pills, or tossing them, within an hour or two 
depending on what Dr. Gilmour said. I chastised myself because I hadn't planned for breaks in routine.
And then, in looking foolish to myself in that instance, I allowed all my reservations about the rest of my actions to flow free. I 
realised I might have been a selfish dolt on more accounts than one. Elaine had been right in what she'd said; I had forgotten a -lot of 
things recently, a lot of important thingslike the London Travel Club, like her appointment. More importantly, like even questioning, 
for a moment, that perhaps this Blaine of whom she murmured was an old lover of hers, or a childhood friend, or even perhaps part of a 
recurring nightmare. I wondered where my trust had gone, why I hadn't just brought it up. I began to regret having been so hasty, and 
so very muddle-headed.
The hours passed slowly, and I knew I had done the most hideous thing I could ever have done. I was in the process of murdering 
my wife, just because of pride, just because I wanted to keep my job, just so I didn't have to hear Marjorie saying, "See, David? I knew 
she couldn't be committed to you. She could have found herself someone rich and not so sensitive, and been quite happy with herself." 
But now, only now did I take a moment to realise that maybe my ears and overly-possessive mind had deceived me, and that that dark
haired fair-skinned woman I'd fallen in love with had not betrayed me for one instant. And if this were trueof course this were true! 
then I had proven myself to be quite a bit less of a man than even Marjorie had imagined.
My coat! I had to get my coat and go off after her, and ensure she never took those pills. If her will had been weak, and she popped 
some as she'd begun motoring in, my poor Elaine might be nearly dead already. Perhaps Marjorie and the Aunties would forgive me, 
leaving my desk post this once.
But that's when the London Travel Club decided to arrive.
Young men and women with cameras and luggage entered the lobby in groups of twos, threes, and fours. They were chattering, and 
Marjorie tip-tapped in to greet them, sending them all over to me at the desk. As more of them poured into the lobby, I knew that if there 
were a God, He was not going to let me undo what I'd done.
An hour and a half later, I'd gotten everyone registered, settled, and Marjorie was beaming and off to harass the kitchen help. As I 
watched her retreating form, I didn't know what to do. Should I scarper off to find Elaine? Damn, I'd forgotten yet another important 
detailshe had our car and getting a hold of Marjorie's would be too suspicious if Elaine should turn up dead. I stood there at the desk, 
staring off into nothingness, tapping a pen.
Lillian entered, still wearing that lavender cardigan, and said, "You look as though you're not faring too well."
I tossed the pen down. "It's that damned London Travel Club. They keep ringing me up, wanting things. Marjorie said they were a 
pampered lot."
Lillian's eyes studied me carefully, unnervingly, behind her thick spectacles. She said, "You're not having a breakdown, are you 
David?"
"A breakdown?" I nearly choked, but went about arranging the registry and pens on the desk.
"Certainly," Lillian said, still watching me. "My first husband, Elton, God rest his soul, had the same unfocused look in his eyes
when he had his breakdown."
"I'm fine." I moved the registry from left to right and back again.
Lillian leaned an elbow on the desktop and said, "Yes, Elton had the same unfocused look... But then again, I did suspect he was
having a breakdown mainly because Elton was talking to his right glove. He called the glove 'Angus'."
I sighed and tried to control my trembling hands. "I've had a rather hard day, and meaning no disrespect, Lillian, I'd really rather not 
hear about this right now."
But Lillian was rubbing her chin thoughtfully and paid no mind to me. "Come to think of it, I never really got round to asking him 
why he called the glove 'Angus,' because he committed suicide a little bit after... Funny."
Aunt Josie entered, chewing on a tea pastry, dropping crumbs on the pile carpeting. "Funny? What's funny? I'm always up for a 
good joke."
This resulted in a lengthy, pointless argument between the sisters to determine whether the glove's name was 'Angus' or actually

---------------------------------------------------

'Agnes.' At this point I thought, there definitely is a God and He's punishing me. All my life, I'd been a basically good, quiet lad, working 
my way to this one hideous act and damning myself to Hell. Perhaps I was already there, and the punishment was to have to listen to 
the Aunties bicker over the name of wiggy Uncle Elton's glove.
The shadows coming in through the front windows were getting long. Arthur came to take over my position at the desk and, 
scanning the area, he said, "What, Elaine's not back yet?"
Tensely I asked, "Why?"
"She's usually here leaning on the desk, talking to you, is all." Arthur was a tall man, even taller than I am when he stood up 
straight, and his shoulders slumped a bit more than usual as he spoke this day.
"Well, you know how long doctors can keep you waiting round," I said.
The shadows got even longer, the sun a faint glow behind trees and cloud, and I sat in the parlour, watching for Elaine to motor 
down the drive.
Lillian tottered in and turned on lights. "Why are you sitting here in the dark?"
Blinking in the bright light, I said, "Elaine's not back yet," and I was surprised at the sincere gloom in my voice as the words were 
spoken. In the morning, I had worried how I was going to pull off regret at my wife's loss. Things were so much different now.
"Oh, you're worried," said Lillian with a wave of her bony hand.
"She's always on time," I mumbled.
"It's going to be all right." Lillian teetered to the window. "Look, is that Elaine now?"
But it was not Elaine's car pulling in. Instead, the automobile held a police constable, who came inside to inform us all that Elaine 
was dead. The world wavered in front of me, but I tried to remain as outwardly calm as I could. Then I listened, and learned this death 
had nothing to do with my actions. They'd found her motorcar wrecked not far from our inn and from the tire tracks. It appeared it had 
run down a small cliff drop-off and crashed while swerving violently to avoid a reckless (perhaps drunk) driver. According to the 
constable, there was no way Elaine could have survived the accident, and we were reassured that she wasn't to blame.
The Aunties gasped and conversed with each other in low tones. Marjorie looked round to see that all from the London Travel Club 
were not mucking about the lobby, then began sobbing.
And I simply didn't know what to do, how to feel. My hideous plot hadn't worked, but Elaine was still dead, and I didn't know 
whether to be satisfied, or appalled, relieved, or cursing life itself. The constable went away, and I still didn't know what to say, so I said 
nothing, and went about in a silent stupour. Lillian patted my arm and eyed me with concern on her spectacled face. Later I heard her 
whisper to Josie that they were to keep an eye out should I decide to chat with any of my accessories.
Mostly, my wife's family concerned themselves with their own grief.
So the funeral came and all I wished was to get through it. For my poor Elaine, there would be no open casket. I still could not find 
the proper reaction, and I heard, in passing, friends and relatives comment upon my vacantness. Finally the condolences, the polite 
repliesthey were all over. Returning home, I let the three sniffing women in black out of the car, parked it, and decided to walk. The 
clouds appeared ready to burst, but I continued onward, past fields and farms. I wouldnt have to confess, though I knew if I passed by 
anyone, Id be likely to blurt it all out. I turned round and strode back to the end of the drive, reaching into our postbox so automatically, 
for the post goes on without Elaine.
And there I found an envelope with only my name upon the front. I hesitated, turning it over in my hands. Feeling strangely and 
unreasonably guilty, I hurried into the garden and opened the envelope, withdrawing a note:
Sloppy, Mr. Graeme. Very, very sloppy. I examined her pills today, you know, and all I can say is its a good thing I found out in time.
Actually, I found out about a lot of things recently. That Elaine was married, for one. It never occurred to me shed be allergic to the metal 
in a wedding band. And it seems she was allergic to monogamy, too. We both were duped, werent we?
I learned of you when she mentioned (oh-so-innocently, too) that you dispensed her pills. Though loving, she was unseeing and 
thoughtless. But now we can revel in our common situations because, in a curious way, we are Elaines men, and she deceived us all. I 
wonder if you know an Arthur? Elaine talked most lovingly of him in her sleep... but perhaps youve heard.
I do want to say that, though I did despise you for a time, when it came down to The End, I couldnt let you take the fall while there were 
other... more effective... means of...
Its a strange and unfair bond, isnt it? Im sure in reading this, youll act accordingly and we can freely go on with our lives.
Dr. Blaine J. Gilmour
Yes, I would act accordingly Hands shaking, I determined my in-laws would never learn how very right theyd been about Elaines 
characternot from this message, and not from me. I stood there in the garden Elaine had so loved, and decided I would be moving on, 
soon, as there were plenty of positions for men who didnt think too much of themselves to take them. It seems Id been a fool a thousand 
times, and still, somehow, all of the jealousy, all of the pride, had run out of me; I felt very little but a general self-loathing. After reading 
the note twice, I ripped it up and, clawed up the ground, buried it under the lilac bushes. They werent blooming, but lilacs were always 
Elaines favourite. I had almost got to the porch before it began to rain, and I waited on the front walk as the drops washed the garden dirt 
from my hands.

"There's nothing wrong with Clark Wcttingher," my guidance counselor, Miss Pogue said. Hes just more interested in studies than most other people." She 
told me this during my scnior-ycar conference. It was school policy that every senior have one at the beginning of their final year. While Miss Pogue was speaking to 
me, she was writing little yellow post-it notes to herself. Since I had arrived, she had already covered her phone with them.
"I do just as well in my classes as he docs in his," I said. "And I manage to have a life."
"Clark Wcttingher has a life," she said, sticking a note to a coffee mug.
"Well, he's breathing," I said. "But he doesn't have a life."
"Then why has he completed his senior-year community project," she said. She spoke to her pad. "And you haven't?"
"Because its a stupid requirement for graduating," I said. "I dont sec the point in it." I watched her pen write "Laundry - 3:30/no stch."
"Every senior has to complete it," she said. "Just something simple, like tutoring. It looks excellent to colleges when they see you involved."
"Admitting that I'm a nerd is not getting involved."
"Thats not so," she said. "Tutoring is actually a very social activity. You'll get to meet someone you never knew..She kept talking as she stuck the laundrynotc to the briefcase at her feet. She wont on for another ten minutes. As I was leaving her office, she was chasing one of the sticky yellow squares through her hair. 
It said "Oil check," in big red letters. I shut her in. and wrote my name and homeroom number on the list outside her office. I did well in Algebra two years in a row. 
I was willing to tutor only one fellow student. I'd rather 10 do it at home; junior or senior only, please.
Of course it was little Paul Steadman who began coming to my house Tuesdays and Thursdays at three. He always showed up in sweats or shorts or tanktops, 
and his body gave my kitchen the dean odor of dry mud. My house had never had an odor until Paul began coming over.
It was October. Paul only knew this because football season had just begun. Hed bang in through our kitchen door (shedding three or four gym-bags on our 
mud-mat), drop his helmet on the table, his cleats on my mother's chair, and head straight into the family room, all the while asking for something to eat. Then I would 
spend fifteen minutes prying his nose out of Musc/e & Fitness. I'd try two or three times, using simple words, but he'd just absentmindedly stare at the magazine as if he 
hadn't heard me. Even at the kitchen table, his only semi-conscious movement was a constant stomach-rubbing, or the occasional scrub through the back of his shortcropped head.
"Dont lean back in the chair. Paul. I'd always tell him. "It drives my father nuts." The chair legs left divots in the braided carpet. On weekends my father 
would finger the dents like he could push them out of the way. Paul insisted that they werent his fault, though. They were there before he was. and by the way. he had 
to leave exactly at four so he could catch the tail end of football practice.
"Thats nice," I'd answer. "Chair down."
Whenever Id start to check over the problems hed completed, hed again lose interest in everything Algebraic. Id watch him out of the corner of my eye. 
Paul had as many distractions as he did muscles. Hed pull footballs from one of his bags and bounce them off the refrigerator door. Hed pick the mud out of the spikes 
in his cleats. (Then Id have to get the hand-held and vacuum beneath him.) Or sometimes he'd make it all the way back into the family room with his magazine.
"Do you know," hed say slowly to the pages, his voice vacant, like he was puzzling over the words. "Do you know how many times I can go to the bathroom 
in one day? Take a guess." I didnt answer him. "Go ahead," he insisted. "Just try to guess how many times I can take a crap in one day."
"Paul, I dont 
Three," he said. He nodded his head at the magazine triumphantly. "Three times a day. Thats a good sign, you know. That Im eating well."
"Bathrooms in the front hall on the left. I told him. He only looked up at me shrewdly.
"How many times can you ?
"Paul." I interrupted. "I am not going to compete with your bowels." I took a couple steps toward the door, waiting for him to follow.
"Youre scared," he said airily. He slouched deeper into the couch. He sounded exactly like my little sister, except she was thirteen. Paul was one-hundred 
and ninety-one pounds, ho bragged. Tugging on a guy as big as that was like yanking the bumper of a parked car. It took both my hands just to circle his heavy arm. No 
matter how hard Id jostle him, he wouldnt so much as turn his head from the pages. He'd eventually just grab the front of my shirt and fling me upside down onto the 
couch beside him. Suddenly Id be flattened into the cushions, his forearm across my throat.
Tutoring you." I'd wheeze underneath him. "Is like babysitting and not getting paid."
I later told this to Denise Randazzo. She had bounced up to me in the library a few weeks after Miss Pogue had stuck me with Paul. Denise banged her bag 
onto the floor beside us and shimmied out of her coat. Watching her made me think of shampoo smell. Denise was someone who I had never spoken with directly,
but spent a lot of time being sympathetic for. She had the biggest teeth I had ever seen. Everyone thought she was wonderful, but I didn't think anyone deserved to
have teeth that big. It was spooky. She told me that it was about time we had met and asked what I was studying so hard. I didnt answer her at first.
"Anybody in there?" she said.
"Algebra. I said. I pulled my eyes back down to the book. It was a copy of the one Paul used in his class.

---------------------------------------------------

"Oh. I hacc Algebra," Denise said.
"I'm not actually in Algebra." I told the crease in the book. "Im in Calculus."
"You just study Algebra for fun. then?" She used her pinkie to switch a sandy wall of hair to the left side of her head.
"Im a tutor. I snapped. "My community thing. To graduate."
"I'm helping clean backstage in the theater," she said. She changed her mind about her hair and her pinkie pushed it back to the other side. "So tell me. 
who do you tutor?" She hoisted her bag onto the table. It sounded like a dead animal.
"Some dumb wrestler." I said.
"Nice attitude. You even know his name?"
"Paul." I mumbled into the book.
"Paul Steadman?" she gasped. Her mouth was open, but I didnt look. "I don't believe Paul Steadman has a tutor in Algebra."
"I don't believe Paul Steadman can pronounce Algebra." I said, looking up. Denise was trying to ignore the comment, but I noticed the corners of her mouth 
were twitching. She looked away, out the window beside us.
"He always seemed so  intelligent." she said, as if in a daze.
"Yes." I said, consolingly. "Most primates do."
Her teeth disappeared under a reluctant smirk. "You  you have absolutely no respect for " she began. I grinned. She swung her head away. "I mean 
hes a  he's a great guy and. you  you are so. so!"
"Much higher of a life form?" I said.
The laugh that burst out of Denise caused her to double over her bag. The decaying, bun-headed librarian came hobbling over, telling us to keep it down. 
Denise then began snorting with laughter and accidentally dropped a pearl of drool down onto her bag. It made me shiver. My body convulsed with giggles, and my 
hand knocked the book from the table. It landed squarely on the librarians club foot. We laughed all the way to the vice principles office.
"I've never been kicked out of a library before," I said. "It's not something you think really happens."
"Ive never been able to laugh at someone I had a crush on," Denise said. She wiped her eyes with a klecncx. "It's not something you think should happen."
Denise began sitting with me every lunch. She got my phone number and would call me at night. She offered me rides in her Volkswagen. I just humored 
her; she was really after Paul. But the attention felt nice for a change  I didn't really care why I got it. Usually I had tried not to think about girls; they made me nervous. 
Girls kept secrets. I never liked what I couldn't see. I dont think I had ever had a secret in my life. Denise was gentle, though, and suddenly I had tons. My favorite 
one was about the man Denise had once met at a summer camp. He moved to Chile after the season, and took Denises address with him. He never wrote her, though. 
He would write letters to himself and just mail them to Denise's address. She had them saved in a cookie tin in her closet: two years worth of ragged air mail envelopes. 
She sat me on the golden shag rug of her room and showed me.
"I always wonder what he tells himself," she said. "But I'd never open them."
Has he ever written you a letter?" I asked. I began twirling the cookie tin's lid between my middle fingers.
"Oh. no." she said.
"Do you love him? I asked. She blushed.
A little." she said. She tilted her head and watched her own thumb stroke the flower on a stamp. "Funny thing is I dont even remember what he looks 
like. I just love his name. Andres Pasquale."
"Do you think hell come looking for them someday?"
"It doesn't matter," she said. "I'd hold on to them even if he didnt. I promised."
The Tuesday after Denise showed me the letters we had heavy rain. Paul showed up soaked and stood in my doorway blowing drops of water off his nose. 
His socks made the kitchen stink of wet cotton. He asked me for grapes, he asked me for pretzels, and he asked me for a towel. As he spoke he scrubbed his flat, 
blonde hair with his fingers. It was sending sprays of water all over my notes and books. I hate the sight of wet paper, so I bolted upstairs to the linen closet. I grabbed 
my sister Faye's old bunny towel.
When I returned to the kitchen I found Paul's huge back at the sink. He didn't have his shirt on; he was busy ringing it out. The room smelled like wet deodorant, 
and as I watched the muscles rolling under his shoulders I realized Paul had no secrets. When he wrote letters  if he wrote letters  they were*always opened, 
and they probably smelled. He thanked me for the towel and went to the table rolling it around his head. He sat down, tilted back, and fell into his usual daze, staring 
down at his white, wrinkly feet.

---------------------------------------------------

"Feet don't look good wet." he said to them, matter-of-factly.
Feet dont look good at all," I told him.
"Everything looks better wet." he explained. "Except feet."
"And paper." I added. He agreed by pulling a magazine out of his duffel bag. It was a soggy Muscle & Fitness. He held it between his thumb and finger, like 
a dead fish.
"Damn," he breathed, and shook his head at the wavy photo on the cover. It was a picture of a man with huge arms yanking on a cable that went off to the 
left. Glistening with sweat or grease or whatever, the tremendous guy actually looked normal. If he were dry. he probably would have looked like he was sick and 
swelling. The way my mother did when she ate shellfish; bulging out to twice her size. My eyes became fixed on the huge man. I imagined dowsing my mother with 
buckets the next time she swelled up with allergies. Maybe she wouldn't look as green if she were drenched.
"Incredible, isn't he?" Paul said quietly.
"Nuh - no," I said. I wasn't sure what he meant, so I took my eyes from the wrinkled magazine. Suddenly it felt strange staring at the man; like we were 
voyeurs, not just admirers. I didn't like that. I gave him his privacy by turning the magazine over. Paul looked at me quizzically. "I was  I was just thinking, thats 
all." I explained. "About - allergies " but before I could finish. I was interrupted by the squealing of the screen door behind me.
My sister Faye had come home from school. She began complaining as she slid out of her coat. She had forgotten her umbrella, she was splashed by a car. 
her hair was ruined. However, before kicking off her second boot, she stopped short. Her little mouth dropped helplessly, gaping toward Paul's bare arms. He grinned 
at me. and then slightly flexed the back of the one closest to Faye.
"Shut the door," I instructed. Faye moved like a zombie, not taking her eyes from him. She stood on the plastic mud mat in silence for a few minutes. Her 
socks drank up the small puddles there.
"You wrestle with Gwen Pinkham's big brother," she said. Her voice was lost and airy, like she was forgetting the words while she spoke them.
"Well, actually." Paul grinned. "I'm co-captain of the team." His voice was deeper and breathier than usual. He rested his huge arms behind his head. He 
made his biceps bump up and down rhythmically a few times. It caused Faye's mouth to drop down again. Her face turned even more pink than usual. She sped from 
the kitchen with small steps.
"That was mean." I said, turning to Paul. "The poor girl's in eighth grade. She has asthma. You could have.killed her with your shirt off." However. Faye 
lived long enough to call me over to the staircase a little later that afternoon. She stood on the landing, frantically yanking a brush through her thin hair.
What is Paul Steadman doing in my house!" she hissed. "I'm going to die!"
"I tutor him in Algebra." I said.
"Paul Steadman needs a tutor in Algebra?" she gasped. Her face was like Denise's. "Listen. Hugh." Faye said, stepping down to eye-level. "If you dare tell 
him that that is my bunny towel, I swear I will kill you." She pointed the brush at me threateningly.
"Go do your homework."
"Im serious," she said, stomping her foot lightly. As I turned away, she stepped down and leaned over the banister. "And can I call Gwen over?" she asked. 
"Gwens dying to see him up close." I replied over my shoulder.
"She'd have to compete with his bowels." I said. "So forget it."
"Remember." she hissed. "No towel!"
Faye never saw that bunny towel again, anyway; I let Paul take it with him. It gave Faye something to brag about to her friend Gwen. They giggled at the 
image of Paul walking out onto the football field with nine pink bunnies draped out of his pants instead of the rag he usually used. The thought of that towel coated 
with the sweat and spit from his huge hands sent them wild for days. It made me jealous to hear them squealing; jealous that it only took one secret to make Paul Steadman 
interesting. I wanted to tell Faye that Paul wasnt a romantic; I let him keep the towel because I didnt want her to find it in the garbage. The truth was that Paul Steadman 
had killed the bunnies.
While he had been alone in the kitchen that day, Paul was absentmindedly tossing a pencil up and down. It had arched higher and higher, until it began butting 
the ceiling. It left a duster of small pink dots. Paul got excited. The pencil went up harder. The dots got darker. He had stopped the game by the time I returned 
from the foyer. He had had to; the last time the pencil had gone up it didn't come down. It was lodged into the ceiling plaster by its tip. There was no romance, no 
g'ggling, no reciting Fayes name. Paul had ruined my ceiling . We had to repair it.
I got up on a chair and dabbed spacklc into the hole. I needed something to smooth it out. and before I realized what Paul had handed me. one of the nine 
pink bunnies had spacklc smeared across its rump. Then I poked a coat of white paint through the erascr-dots. When I asked Paul for a rag. three more bunnies bit 
the dust. The towel was ruined, and no one had fallen in love, although the way Paul was watching me had made me nervous. I told him his face looked like Fayes,

---------------------------------------------------

and lie grinned shrewdly. For a minute I thought he really had a secret  about me. I got nervous. However, the grin only turned out to be a low. rumbling belch; 
Paul had no mystery, only gas. So I sent him outside to rinse the brush. I made him bring the towel along as well, and told him to drape it over the shrub bed. I warned 
him not to get any paint on the bushes, that I didnt want my father to know what happened. When he returned from outside, he assured me the shrubs were fine, 
and wiped his hands on the last clean bunny. He said hed throw the towel in the schools dumpster when he made it to practice.
So hes gone?" Faye whispered to me across the kitchen. I was standing by the screen door watching the rain when she poked her thin orange head around 
the corner. "What happened down here? It smells like paint."
"Nothing," I said through the screen. "And dont tell dad."
My father didn't even notice the smell when he came in at six. However, he did stop at the sink window for an unusually long time. He leaned his round 
glasses close to the pane and squinted. He held his hand to his hip as he studied something just below the windowsill. My mother told him to move out of the way; 
that she was trying to finish cooking dinner. Suddenly he dashed out the side door, heading to the backyard through the garage. He returned a few minutes later, 
settling slowly behind the placemat my mother had just set before his chair.
"There are white dots on the rhododendra." he said to a fork. He hooked his arm over the back of the chair and nibbled his glasses. He didn't say anything 
for a while until Faye asked for the pepper during dinner.
"Its right there, Dad." She pointed beyond his elbow.
"There are " he said, then stopped. He picked up the pepper and considered it. holding it up to the light. We watched him expectantly. "There arc. 
There arc white dots. On the rhododendra." As Faye took the pepper she gave my mother a look of confusion. My mother didn't notice, however. She was studying 
the ceiling, staring dumbly over Faye's head.
There are, absolutely," my father said louder. "White dots all over the rhododendra."
"Maybe it's the rain." Faye said.
"Hugh, my father said. He picked his fork and knife up and began slicing his pork chop. "Hugh, were you aware that, in the back yard, there are, well, 
these little white dots on the rhododendra."
"White dots." I said.
"White dots. my father repeated. "On the rhododendra. What do you think about that, Hugh?"
My fork stirred through my flooping green beans.
"I thought about wrestling, today." I said.
"Wrestling the rhododendra?" my mother said to the ceiling.
"No. just about wrestling." I replied. The table was quiet except for clinking.
"I wrestled in college." My father said. "You'd be killed." He twisted a chunk of pork in his applesauce. "These dots  they're small, and sort of dusty."
"I wouldn't be killed. I said.
"Hugh." my father sighed. "I know for a fact: you're too small. Too small." He contemplated the words as he chewed. "Some of these dots; theyre big. 
But then, some arent"
"I'm not that small, anymore." I said. I straightened myself up and Faye rolled her eyes.
"What happened to track." my father said. "I thought you loved track. You have always loved track. Why do you want to switch horses in the middle
of your senior year?"
"I only thought about wrestling." I said. "Not about joining the team."
"That's good, dear." my mom chewed. She angled her eyes to see the ceiling better. "Youd be flat with your back out all over again.
I've grown out of that." I said. I reached for the basket of rolls. I tore one. but left it on my plate.
"He was wrestling with Paul today." Faye said.
"I was not."
I heard you." she said. She turned to my mother. "They were banging around all afternoon. My mother didnt take her eyes from the ceiling.
Shouldn't mess with that Paul Steadman." my father said. "He's a real work. Bet he could pop your neck right off.[end excerpt

---------------------------------------------------

This is how it is when three 
cops walk into a diner at 3am: every
one with a guilty conscience stares at 
the food on their plate. Drunks and 
potheads try to act sober. The others 
sit up and try to look like law-abiding 
citizens. All of them keep an eye out in 
case you're there to arrest somebody. 
When people are watching me like this 
I always want to tap some poor drunk 
bastard on the shoulder and say, 
"Excuse me sir, you been driving under 
the influence?" And when he says no 
I'd say, "Well then Id sure like to know 
why you're using an eight year old girl 
as a hood ornament." He'd just about 
shit! Cops dont look kindly on behav
ior like this though.
Pete's is packed, so Julie and 
Derek and I have to stand by the door 
and wait for a seat. Derek is Julie's 
new partner. Usually its just Julie and 
me. Last time we were here she told 
me Derek got stuck with a late shift 
even though hes been in the depart
ment for fifteen years. Someone 
upstairs doesn't like him, she said. I 
told her she was breaking my heart ail 
over the place.
My watch reads ten after three
now. Pete's gets all the riff raff from 
the dance club across the street and 
the other one around the block after 
they close. I like Pete's because it's not 
a greasy spoon. It smells like my 
father's house: bacon and cigarettes. 
Very spiffy outfit, paintings and every
thing, but it's open 24 hours so I call it 
a diner.
The waitress comes up and 
asks, "How many? even though its 
obviously three. She is middle-aged 
and not pretty but Derek flashes her a 
big smile anyway. Derek has a blond 
walrus moustache that frames his 
teeth when he smiles. It's damn 
creepy, like it's some kind of orifice, but 
not a mouth.
The waitress leads us to booth 
by the window. As we walk past the 
tables I frown and give everyone the 
old cop eye. One red-eyed lady doesn't 
look up from her plate. A guy with slick 
hair darts his eyes at me and turns 
away. No one ever stares back for 
more than a second. I make them feel 
guilty. I'm not even wearing a uniform. 
They start running down mental lists of 
every crime and sin they committed in 
he last week. The cop's eye makes you

feel like a criminal.
In the next to last booth is an 
old man in a baseball cap. He drinks 
from a bowl of soup clutched in both 
hands. His eyes shift from the soup to 
me. We watch each other as I pass. I 
want to turn away, but he won't go 
back to his soup. He puts the bowl 
down and he is smiling. His teeth are 
perfect and white.
The waitress shows us to our 
booth and Julie slides in. Derek sits 
right beside her. I sit down opposite 
them with my back to the old man. In 
the comer of my eye I see the old man 
look around at us and I smell his chick
en soup breath.
"What's that puss on your face 
for?" Derek asks.
"I dont got a puss on my 
face." I feel the old man's eyes on me 
but I glance over and he's turned 
around.
"Doesnt he got a puss on his 
face?" he asks Julie.
She half grins. Julie and I 
went to the academy together. She is 
not the most beautiful woman in the 
world but in a way she is kind of pretty. 
She has short, curly blond hair and she
has a tan even though it's winter. "He 
always looks like that."
"It's just how I look."
"Okay." He raises his palms. 
"Don't mean no harm by it, buddy. Just 
that you look like your dog just died."
Julie opens her menu. Derek 
doesn't open his own, he just scoots 
closer to Julie and reads over her 
shoulder. I already know my order but I 
open my menu anyway so I don't have 
to look at Derek. In the breakfast sec
tion is a picture of eggs, bacon, and 
home fries. What I like about Pete's is 
that the food always looks as good as 
it does on the menu.
The waitress comes up to our 
table. "What can I get you?" She 
looks right at Derek and he gives her 
another smile.
"Tuna melt and fries," he says. 
"And coffee."
Julie orders coffee and a 
cheeseburger. I order eggs, bacon, 
home fries, and coffee. The waitress 
takes our menus and Derek lights a cig
arette.
"How come you got break
fast? he asks.
"Cause I like breakfast."

---------------------------------------------------

Julie taps Derek on the shoul
der and nods at me. "Dan's just getting 
up."
"That right? Hell, when I saw 
you waiting out there, I figured you'd 
been up all night."
"I always look like that too." I 
got bags under my eyes. When I look 
in the mirror, I smooth them out with 
my thumbs and they don't look as bad.
"Ain't that funny?" Derek says. 
"We're getting off our shift and you're 
just starting yours.
The waitress delivers our cof
fees. I put two dollops of cream in 
mine and take a sip.
"Where's that you work?"
Derek asks.
"Downtown."
He scratches his moustache.
"I mean where at?"
"Bakery." I know what he
meant.
Derek jerks his head sideways 
as a shrug. "That's honest work, Dan. 
But I thought Julie told me you went to 
the academy together."
Julie coughs into her hand and 
stares at the table. I grit my teeth. I 
can't tell if hes making fun of me or
not.
"Yeah. Yeah, I went to the 
academy.
"Police work ain't good enough 
for you, huh? He laughs and reaches 
over and slaps me on the shoulder. 
"Can't say I blame you."
I lean back in my seat and 
stare at him. "My dad's a cop."
"Hey, I am too, pal. I aint 
knocking it. I ain't knocking bakery 
work either. Got yourself a steady 
income."
I hate the damn bakery. The 
boss is a short old Italian bastard and 
he's always yelling at me for some
thing. Mostly he yells that I don't use 
enough flour in the bread. He shakes 
his fist all the time. "More flour!
More flour! How many times do I have 
to tell you!" That's what working at 
the bakery is: more flour. By the end of 
the day I'm head to toe with flour.
When I'm leaving I always sing:
"Won't be sour 
In an hour 
When I shower 
Off the flour."
The boss tears his hair out 
because I sing It every day. It's true 
though. The flour makes a paste in my 
ears when I wash.
I take another sip of coffee and 
when I put the cup down I see some
one at my shoulder. The old man In the 
baseball cap stands there smiling with 
his white teeth. He holds a plastic 
shopping bag with a newspaper inside.
"How you all doing today?" he 
asks. His voice is rough and slurred, 
but he doesn't look drunk. I give him 
my cop eye so he'll realize he should 
watch his step. All good officers have 
the cop eye. I've seen what it looks 
like on me in the mirror. My eyebrows 
knit a little, and I frown, but mostly it's 
in the eyes: a cold, hard stare.
"How are you, sir? Derek
asks.
"Good," says the old man, nod
ding. "I just wanted to tell you officers 
you're doing fine jobs." He shakes 
Derek's hand, then Julie's.
"Thank you," Julie says, smil
ing politely.
"Fine jobs." The old man turns 
to me. "You an officer too?"
This burns me up because I
can't quite rightly say yes. But I'm bet
ter at being a cop than most cops are. 
"I have police training," I say, which is 
the solid truth.
The old man does not react. 
"You know 5th and Market?"
I sit up. "Yes, sir."
"You know where that is? I 
used to own a necktie store down 
there."
"Oh." I nod my head. Julie is 
watching me. She tilts her head 
towards him like I should keep talking.
I never know what to say to strangers 
when they tell me about their lives. I 
don't know what they want me to say. 
Finally I say, "Neckties?"
He pats me on the shoulder. 
"You come down. I'll fix you all up with 
neckties."
"That's very nice of you," Julie
says.
"I know Kojak," he says to me. 
"You know Kojak?"
I stare at him and I cant say 
anything. I don't know if he means 
Kojak th TV detective, or Telly 
Savalas, or if there's actually some 
poor cop named Kojak.
"Oh yes, hes doing fine," Julie
says. She smiles warmly.
"He used to come around all 
the time," he says, turning to her. He 
lifts his cap and scratches his head. "Is 
he still in town?"
"I think he's in town," she 
says. "I haven't seen him around 
though."
"How about Chips?"
I glance at Julie and feel my 
face blush. She looks completely 
relaxed.
"They're in California," she
says.
"Oh yeah," the old man says.
He turns to me and shakes my hand. 
"You an officer?"
I just nod this time.
"You need a uniform. Cops 
have to have uniforms. Don't buy the 
necktie. I'll get you the necktie."
"He'll be fine," Julie says.
The old man nods, turns 
around, and walks across the diner 
towards the restrooms.
I stare at the paper placemat in 
front of me and drink my coffee.
"Jesus H. Christ," Derek says. 
"Crazy as a bedbug that guy."
"Shame what happens some

---------------------------------------------------

times," Julie says.
I don't look up. A picture of 
Petes diner is sketched in green and 
white on the placemat. I never paid 
attention to what it looks like on the 
outside so I dont know if the picture is 
accurate or not.
The waitress arrives with our 
food. Derek and Julie dig right in but I 
don't feel hungry any more. I feel sick 
to my stomach, the way I did in the 
academy sometimes. Julie always 
looked out for me, like I was her kid 
brother. Once, towards when I left the 
academy, I planned on sleeping through 
a test I knew I was going to fail. I was 
failing at the academy anyway. I woke 
up and heard someone fiddling with 
the door to my room. Julie picked the 
lock.
"Dan, god damn it, she said. 
She turned on all the lights.
I didn't say anything. My face 
was to the wall.
"I'm going to be late too now. 
Get up, god damn it."
I turned over on my back. "I'm 
sleeping."
She grabbed my arm and 
pulled me half out of the bed. I didn't
resist or fight or anything. I lay there 
with my head on the carpet, staring at 
her upside-down face.
"Get up."
"I already failed."
"You stupid asshole." She 
grabbed my hair and my face and it 
hurt like hell so I stood up. I was in my 
underwear and I was humiliated. She 
waited while I got dressed, and we 
left. Part of me was grateful that she 
paid attention to me. Part of me hated 
her.
We walked to the test build
ing. I stopped in the hallway.
"You go ahead. I have to go to 
the bathroom."
She pursed her lips. "Jesus. 
Hurry up."
"No you go ahead.
She glanced at her watch. 
"We're fifteen minutes late already for 
an hour exam."
"I know. I'll be there in a
minute."
She looked down the hallway. 
"You better get there."
"I'm already here, I said. "I'm 
not going anywhere."
She frowned and nodded, then
left. I walked Into the mens room. I 
didnt have to go after all. I looked at 
myself in the mirror and pressed my 
thumbs under my eyes. My face looked 
weary. I practiced the cop eye for a 
while. I had it down pretty good. My 
eyes got icy, like they were judging a 
person's soul. I wasn't sure how long 
Id practiced the cop eye for, but I fig
ured the exam was nearly over, so I 
left.
I told part of that story to my 
dad, about Julie waking me up (not for 
an exam) and all he said was some 
women like to mother.
I haven't touched my eggs. 
They're sunny-side up. I thought I 
ordered them over easy but maybe I 
didnt say at all. I stick a piece of 
bacon in the yolk and it breaks and 
bleeds all over.
"You all right, Dan?" Julie 
asks. She's finished her cheeseburger, 
and Derek's finished his tuna melt.
I shrug. "I'm not hungry."
"Hell, they must give him free 
food at the bakery," Derek says. "He'll 
be fine."
The waitress comes around 
again. I take a refill of coffee, but Julie
and Derek pass.
"You guys don't have to wait,"
I say. "I'm here until five. The bakery's 
only a ten minute walk."
Derek glances at Julie, lean 
tell he's been busting to get out of 
here. Julie doesn't move yet.
"Tomorrow?" she asks. "You 
working?"
"Yeah. You?"
She nods toward the front 
door. "Three o'clock?"
I nod. Derek stands up and 
Julie slides out of the booth. She picks 
up the check thats sitting by my wrist.
I hadn't even seen it.
She waves the check. "I got it 
tonight. See you tomorrow."
I wave goodnight. I watch her 
pay the check, and they leave. I look 
down at my eggs. They're a puddle of 
yolk now. I actually go to work at four, 
not five, so I have about fifteen min
utes. The thought of my boss shouting 
"More flour!" knots my stomach. I am 
thinking about not going.
A hand rests on my shoulder.
It is the old man. He sits in the seat 
opposite me and puts his hat on the 
table.
"Your officer friends leave?" he
says.
I wave my hand over the table. 
He ignores me and stares at my break
fast. I push the plate across to him.
He picks up a messy egg between his 
finger and puts it in his mouth.
You an officer?" he asks. He 
has yolk on his chin.
"No."
He looks at me for a while and 
shakes his head. "No."
"I work in a bakery."
He sticks a slice of bacon in his 
mouth and stares at me blankly.
"I bake bread."
He chews on the bacon and 
nods. "No neckties for bakers. He 
goes back to his food.
My watch reads five to four.
My boss probably won't notice if I'm 
five minutes late. I stand up and walk 
out.

LSAT, GMAT,VB eg (b 7r .a (

If you are considering one of the Princeton Review's "pre-exams,"you 
should know a couple facts which are not in their ad: Their test costs $ 19.50, 
and it's a routine Princton Review exam.
Instead, take the Kaplan test. You 
can come into our Center any time 
and take a simulated LSAT, GMAT, 
GRE, and MCAT. The experience 
is valuable. Even more valuable is 
the computer-analyzed report: how 
you did and where you need work. 
No fee. No strings. Because if you 
care enough to take this step, you 
deserve to know the score.

TO DR. ROBERT MEHRABIAN
w On January 25, 1993 you sent us a letter encouraging us to accept 
the contract offer from the school. We attempted to see you on 
February 22, 1993 but you would not meet with us. We are now 
requesting that you meet with us so we may explain to you why we 
believe the contract offer is unfair.

Delicatessen
This dark, nightmarish comedy, directed by JeanPierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, is set in post-apocalypse France. In this bleak setting, meat is a 
scarcity, so meat-eaters have taken to cannibal
ism, and vegetarians are hiding out in the sewers 
as underground insurgents.
A Gleasonesque butcher, whose delicatessen is 
right beneath a crumbling apartment building, is 
all-powerful because he is able to provide tenants 
with a constant supply of food. As part of the 
bargain for food, tenants keep his terrible secret 
he provides them with meat parcels whenever a 
new tenant ventures into the dark hallway over
night and mysteriously disappears. As tenants 
wait for the next fresh catch of the day, they amuse 
themseves by watching 30s musicals on their di
lapidated TV sets.
In addition to fiendish black comedy, this film 
offers angular, grotesque, comic-bookish images. It 
was awarded best film at the Chicago Interna
tional Film Festival.
French guys watching old musicals, meat-eaters 
cannibalizing, vegetarians vegetating... what more 
could you possibly want out of life?
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Reservoir Dogs
Directed by Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs 
is probably among the most violent but also the 
more interesting films from 1992. The film oozes 
with testosterone, completely reinventing the 
screen-gangster idiom with its stark brutality and 
raw, realistic language.
A group of anonymous professional crooks com
bine forces in order to pull off a massive jewel heist. 
Through flashback, the film slowly reveals the 
individual, although violent, natures of the anony
mous thieves, in addition to discovering how some
thing has gone terribly wrong with the heist, due to 
inside treachery.
For the weaker-hearted, this is an intensely 
violent film. However, this film offers far more 
than the standard shoot-em-up gangster flick. It 
gives a glimpse into the dark life and stark reality 
of the criminal world. Even if you dont think you 
can handle the violence, you might want to try and 
see this film anyway.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Scent of a Woman
A1 Pacino gives an Academy Award-winning 
performance as Frank Slade, a petulant and blind 
ex-Army lieutenant colonel and former aide to 
Lyndon Johnson whos visiting New York City for 
a weekend of luxury  beautiful women, gourmet 
cuisine, and a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. Chris 
ODonnell plays young scholarship student Charlie 
Sims, who is reluctanly along for the ride and 
getting the education of a lifetime.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Rock n RoU High School
This 1979 cult classic stars Vincent Van Patten, 
Clint Howard, Dey Young, and (yay!) the Ramones.
P. J. Soles stars as the popular Riff, the Ramones 
number-one fan who leads her school to rebellion 
against the oppression of the new principal Miss 
Togar. Van Patten plays the boring Tom, who has 
a crush on Riff.
The movie is full of destructive, smash-yourguitar, rock n roll fun; and a great Ramones 
soundtrack featuring songs like I Wanna Be Se
dated, Blitzkrieg Bob, and Sheena Is a Punk 
Rocker.
The ending is of course happy, destructive, and 
a lot of fun, resulting in everybody dancing to the 
Ramones, and lots of paper and furniture being 
thrown out of office windows.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Superman resurrected in new comic

Son, Im convinced that the only 
reasonyoure here is that we raised 
you with the concept of mortality! 
Youve been conditioned to accept 
this fate, and maybe it doesnt 
have to be that way at all!

you're totally wiped? Revive 
with Vivarin. Safe as coffee, 
Vivarin helps keep you awake
