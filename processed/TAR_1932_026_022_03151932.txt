MATINEE ON FRIDAY
Tchekovs Play is Story of 
Frustrated Love and 
Art
"The Sea Gull, Anton Tchekovs 
four-act drama of frustrated love 
and art, is the next production of 
the Department of Drama. Under 
the direction of E., W. Hickman, 
it will open tomorrow evening in 
the Little Theater and run through 
March 22, with a matrnee perform
ance next Friday afternoon.' This 
is the one freshman production of 
the, year and gives the first-year 
class an opportunity to display the 
results of their labor of past 
months, when crew work and 
costuming, make-up, diction and 
academics occupied the major part 
of their time. Those who have 
witnessed freshman productions in 
years past know that they can 
look for a triple attraction in this 
performance  of the immortal 
Tchekovs work.
Looking back' through the chron
icles and letters of the period, the 
1890s, one finds ample proof of 
Tchekovs early frustration by the 
theater of the time. It would seem 
that he was ahead of that theater, 
which has been described by the 
critics as a lantern about to expire. 
When The Sea Gull was first per
formed at the Imperial Theater at 
St. Petersburg, it met with failure;,
1 and the playwright determined nevj mto - write, another play if I live' to be 700 years old. However, 
when the* embryo Moscow Art 
Theater came into being a year 
later, the determination arose in 
Tchekov to again shed his light 
into the theater. It was with The 
Sea Gull that the Moscow Art
Theater made its first. success, and 
a sea gull was adopted as their de
vice and appeared on their pro
grams ever after.When The Sea Gull was per
formed as one of a series of Rus
sian plays by the Moscow Art
Theater players on a visit to Amer
ica some ten years ago, the critics 
were loud in their praise. The
charactersa vain actress, an im
pressionable country girl, an aspir
ing but fumbling young playwright, 
a successful novelist, a doctor, and 
-the usual number of farm hands,
servants and old menhave been 
imbued with the breath of life it
self, so that the play unfolds with 
pure expression. The characters, 
the. dialogue, the episodes are set

A COLUMN OF CURIOUS COMMENT 
BY NATHAN MILLER
Police ! Police ! !
The abduction, of .the Lindbergh 
baby (now  going into its third 
week) has provided the American 
public with one of its periodical 
mystery stories. . And how the 
public print loves to lavish all the 
lurid and sensational details in bold 
type through its pages! What a 
boon to discussion over the dinner 
table, in the club-cars, over the 
bridge table, etc.
Delving below the surface of 
these events, does it not imply a 
'devastating criticism of our forces 
of law and order that they can
not apprehend the culprits and thus 
douse the cruel limelight thrust 
upon that Hopewell estate? Where 
are our high-priced and .incor
ruptible gum-shoe men that they 
cannot penetrate through the veil 
of rumor, false reports and the 
impenetrable silence of organized 
crime?
One is led to suspect that the 
criminal, bootlegging and sub-mun
dane world is more cleverly or
ganized and run than our highlytouted police forces. Were the 
though not so utterly disgraceful 
and blasphemous, one might sus
pect that if the outlawed realm 
were to exchange functions and 
powers with our police, one might 
expect less racketeering and crime.
What travesty is mirrored in 
American life as we learn that 
Lindy has to appeal to denizens 
of the underworld craft to retrieve 
his loss. Certainly this is a vote 
of non-confidence in the blue-coats 
and their paraphanelia of crime de
tection and punishment. When 
wits are matched, the unholy pow(ontinued on Page Four)
Committee Alters Rules of 
Interfraternity Sing Contest
The committee in charge of the 
Interfraternity Sing Contest, which 
will be held Friday, April 1, has 
revised a few of the contest 
rules which were printed in the 
last week's issue of the Tartan. 
To Entrance Rule 4 has been 
added the requirement that the 
members of each team, including 
.the leader shall be registered stu
dents. This means that no alumni 
or outside members of any fra
ternity may compete.
In addition to this, Contest 
Rule 3 has been revised to read 
"No school songs or songs of a 
popular nature, will be sung by 
any team. The committee urges 
fraternities to sing songs which 
have been approved by members 
of their national organization. 
This, however,, is not compulsor3\
DR. SUTTON WILL 
ADDRESS PUBLIC
Noted Ornithologist Will 
Speak On Bird Life 
in North
Dr. George M. Sutton, noted 
ornithologist, will 'address the pub
lic next Thursday evening,. March 
17, at 8:15 p. m. in the Carnegie 
Lecture Iiall.
Dr. Sutton is. well known for his 
study; arid research in bird life and 
will lecture on "The. Trail of the 
Harris Sparrow.
lie has justly earned for him
self a position of distinction among 
American ornithologists by his 
thorough investigation of our na
tive avifauna, by his ornithological 
explorations in the North, and by 
his ability to depict his feathered 
models with a faithful and deft 
brush. As an ornithologist he was 
connected with the staff of the 
Carnegie Museum for several years 
and subsequently became chief of 
research and information under the 
Board of Game Commissioners of 
Pennsylvania.
He. was a member of four ex
peditions into the Labrador Penin
sula, all directed by W: E. Clyde 
Todd, curator of Ornithology of 
the Museum, prior to his own ex
ploration of Southampton; which, 
constitutes a most noteworthy un
dertaking in Arctic biological in
vestigations.
His expedition, which will, ' be 
covered in the lecture, involves a 
year at Southampton Island. The 
purpose of the expedition was to 
study the. life of the Harris Spar
row and discover its eggs if pos
sible. There 1 were 'only two birds 
in America whose eggs had.- never 
been seen, but, since Dr. Suttons 
discovery, there - ife only one.
Dr. Sutton is an unusually fine 
bird artist showing precise scien
tific accuracy and artistic merits. 
He has-, produced some very fine 
paintings representing birds as 
alive. -Included in the Southampton 
Island collection is a fine set of 
water colors of birds in their na
tive haunts. Dr. Sutton received 
his artistic training under the late 
Agassiz Fuertes. He is justly 
recognized as one of the foremost 
artists specializing in the painting 
of birds.
Music and Drama Students 
To Combine in Operetta
The Departments of Music and 
Drama are presenting "The Gon
doliers by Gilbert and Sullivan 
in two benefit performances Wed
nesday and Thursdaj' evenings, 
April 6 and '7; at. 8:15 oclock 
in the Carnegie Music Hall. The 
proceeds of these performances 
will be used to establish a Stu
dent'Aid Fund in these two de
partments. Such a fund is a 
necessity at the present time if 
deserving students of talent are 
io be enabled to continue their 
(college courses.
The revival of this operetta 
will serve, it is hoped, a two
fold purpose: (1) to enlist the 
interest of those who regard the , 
needy student of promise as 
worthjof help, and (2) to bring 
to lovers of Gilbert and Sullivan 
the reasons for the great popu
larity of The Gondoliers in 
England. The enthusiasm which 
the production of The Mikado 
by the departments aroused last 
year gives assurance that a simi
lar response will attend this 
years production.

PA G F. TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY. MARCH 15, 1932.
Eastern Intorcollogiato Boxing 
Conference, Friday and 
Saturday Nights, Tartan Gym.TARTAN SPORTS PAGE
Third Annual Interscholastic 
Swimming Relays, 
Saturday Afternoon, Tartan Pool.,
COACH HOGAN'S TOSSERS .added a most acccptable 
ending to their fairly successful season when they defeated Penn 
State last Friday. At this closing of accounts we find 17 vic
tories out of the 26 games. This improvement over last year is 
greater in the light of the longer and more difficult schedule 
that has just been completed.
Captain Jimmy Leonard is the only regular .player to leave 
the team via graduation, leaving Smith, Fergus, Jagnow, and 
Stentz to form the basis of the next squad.
Legs Webster surprised more than one person in the 
Penn State game as he satisfied that urge to make the buckets, 
13 points in all. His play in the last three years has been 
rather irregular due to knee injuries, but his final appearance, 
the other night, more than makes up for some of the games' he 
has missed.* * * * v
THE FAR FAMED AND NOTED, ancient and battered, 
\Pitt jinx suffered a near collapse-in last Saturdays boxing 
match. The Panthers four to three margin was gained after 
seven bouts of spectacular collegiate boxing, during which time 
, Carnegies hope for victory hung in the air until the finish 6f 
the .semi-final bout.
While closing a rather hectic season, Coach Scstos men did 
exhibit some noteworthy points which show that Skibo boxing 
aspirations are on the up grade. Among the Tartan boxers 
, who fought in the Pitt match, there'is only one who answered 
the initial call, two years ago, with any experience in the ring, 
The other six men have begun at the bottom and reached a 
commendable degree of perfection within a training period from 
one month to a year and half.
JERRY OTOOLE AND COWBOY SIEGAL certainly 
put the referee in a tough spot with their three grueling rounds 
of leather pushing. While the majority, of the crowd was not 
in accord with the referees decision, we do agree that his 
grounds for claiming Siegal the winner were mightly slim. Al
though OToole was the aggressor in the last two rounds, the 
Pitt boxer barely earned enough points to outweight his oppo
nents.
Johnny Carr looked pretty good as he scored his third win 
of the season. Tom Waldron totes a heavy wallop for it took 
only a few of these to put his man on the canvas in the second 
round. Royal Wertz came through with his first win of the 
year. These three men and Fraser Helegers. will represent Car
negie in the first Eastern Intercollegiate.Boxing Conference, held 
in the Tartan Gym this week end. Very close decisions are ex
pected for the entries represent the best mittmen of seven 
colleges.
* * * + 
FOR THE THIRD TIME various high schools of the 
Pittsburgh district will gather in the Carnegie pool to decide 
the winner of the Annual Intcrscholastie Swimming Relay 
Meet. The contests will get under way al 3;Q(0 P. M. next 
Saturday. Coach Risedorph, who is directing the meet, expects 
the eviitry list to include over two hundred swimmers.
* * H< >)<
AS PREVIOUSLY PLANNED, the Intermural Swimming 
Meet wil begin at 4:30 P. M., April 1. The Interfraternity 
Singing Contest, scheduled for the same day, will require any
watery minded warblers to change from the swimming suit to
the tux within a short time if they intend to perform in botli 
events,
The entry blanks, which have been distributed for the 
swimming meet, should be filled out and returned to Coach 
Risedorph by 4 :00 l5. M., March 23.
H< H< i|< *
AND NOW THAT THE VARSITY FLOORMKN have 
named their all-opponent team, all arguments about whos who 
and what of it will come to an cud.
The Carnegie Tech basketball 
team gained a 40-27 victory over 
the strong Penn State five in ,thc 
Gym Friday  night. This game 
officially closed the season f6r the 
Plaid. Without a doubt this has 
been the most successful basketball 
campaign in the Tartan's history.
The schedule was . one of the 
longest and toughest that any 
Plaid, team has completed. It con
sisted of 26 games, all of which 
were against strong, opponents. Out 
of this 26-game schedule the Tar
tans emerged victorious 17 times 
and were at the short end of thb 
score only nine times. Strange 
as it seems, Carnegies biggest <lifficulty^ was with district opponents, 
Jimmy Leonard and his boys suf
fering all but two of tlj.eir losses 
right in the vicinity of Pittsburgh.
Sectional opponents suffered great
ly at the hands of the fast-going 
Plaid outfit. Temple was on the 
losing side of  the score oil -two 
different' occasions, while New 
York U, Princeton and Yale, suf
fered defeats in their single en
counters with the Plaid. George
town and Kentucky Wesleyan felt 
the sting of Carncgie'si attack, 
while in the middle west, Western 
Reserve and, the University of 
Chi'cago were the victims of the 
S.coteh. Except for a pfcriod of 
two weeks, when illness of-severals 
members of the team brought 
about a slump, the Tartans ap
proached the class of the district.
Leonard and Webster Star
In the Penn-State game two 
members of the team wrote finis 
to their collegiate basketball ca
reers. Each , of these two men 
finished ,their .work in a blaze , of 
glory. Jimmy 1 Leonard captained 
big team to1 victory with the aid of 
Logan Webster whose, accurate 
shooting earned him thirteen points 
and whose aggressiveness seemed 
to speed up [the whole team.
Carnegie To Be Host To .Seven Colleges
For Eastern Conference Boxing Tourney
, The newly-formed Eastern Inter
collegiate Boxing Conference will 
hold its first annual tournament 
Friday and Saturday, March 18 and 
19, in the Carnegie, gymnasium. 
The student price for tickets has 
been fixed at one dollar for both 
nights and seventy-five cents for one.

versities and colleges, members of 
the conference. These arc Temple 
University, Carnegie Tcch, W. & 
J., West Virginia, Pitt, Bucknell 
and Duquesnc. As provided by the 
conference rules, the .boxers' of 
each team arc rated by the coach 
in the order of their ability, and 
then submitted to the executive 
committee, composed of represenatives of Tcch, Pitt and Temple,
who draw lots for the number of 
entries.
The rating lias been completed, 
with the result that Temple draws 
five men in the meet, West Vir
ginia, Pitt, Carnegie and Bucknell, 
four each, . and Duquesnc a n d 
W. & J., three each. The coaches 
will have had by Friday about 10 
days, to prepare their men for the 
championship.

tournament include Captain Carr, 
Waldron, Hellegcrs and  Wertz. 
These men will represent the 145, 
175, 135 and 115-pound classes, 
respectively.
Competition will be started by 
the 27 star boxers at 8 oclock Fri
day evening. There will be three 
bouts in each class, with the semi
finals on Friday and the finals on

Four Teams Vie For Championship In Intermurals
The end of the Intermural Basketball season is at hand with only 
two more days of regular scheduled 
games. The champions in the differ
ent leagues arc virtually assured of 
their places in all but the FederalLeague. In the American League 
Englcbrccht Hall, with six victories 
and no defeats and only one game 
to play, is the assured winner of thjs 
league. In the National League, the 
Senior Architects seem to be the 
class'; of the. competition. Last week 
they won two important games which 
placed them well ahead. They de
feated the D. Us. by the score of 
17-14. Saturday afternoon they kept 
their slate clean by trimming the 
Betas. The score was 23-17.
The winner in the Federal, League 
was decided last night when the Pi 
Kappa Alphas and the Kappa Sig
mas clashed on the court.
The league winners will begin their 
play-offs sometime this week.

 Tom Waldron and Henry Carr reached a climax in collegiate boxing when they won over their respective opponents in the Pitt match last Saturday. Tom outclassed his man with a knockout in the second round while Henry earned a three-round decision by virtue of superior boxing ability.Had he -not been hampered by slight illnesses, Waldron would have accompliohed better results in, his 17,5-pound class. Tom was defeated by slight margins at West Virginia arid Yale.Through his consistant hard work, which was rewarded with definite improvement, Henry Carr has advanced from the beginning of the ring game to a formidable opponent. He boxes in the 145-pound class and has won three out of five bouts t^liis season. Carr was recently appointed captai:^ of the Plaid team by Coach Sestio.Captain Carr and Waldron, together'with Wertz and Hellegers, will represent Carnegie in the coming tournament. The first two named have a good chanc.c to win in the fianls.

Last Saturday marked the finish 
of the most successful season ever 
enjoyed by any Carnegie Tcch swim
ming team. Although forccd to bow 
to a stronger Pitt team in their 
finale, the Tartan natators can, 
nevertheless, feel justly proud of the 
exhibition they gave against the 
Panthers. Swimming in the face of 
such odds as injuries and ineligibili
ties, the tankers put up their usual 
stiff fight and the meet was much 
more closely contested than the final 
39 to 20 score would indicate,
Pitt jumped into the lead with a 
victory in the relay and increased 
their advantage when Adlersburg 
nosed out Pal Miller in the 50 free. 
Tcch came right back with Boyer and 
Cadmus sweeping the backstroke, and 
tied the contest at eleven all. Ted 
Eastabrooke, handicapped by injuries, 
was forccd to accept a third in the 
diving;  and .Captain Bill Edwards 
added another third in the 440 free. 
Thompson s\yam , his best breast
stroke racii of the year when  he 
wound up ahead of the formidable G. 
Schmicler of Pitt. In the feature 
event of the afternoon, the 100 yard 
free style, Pal Miller was just touch
ed out by Hanna after leading most 
of the way.
The final figures for the* Plaid 
swimming season.show sjx meets in 
the win column against the one de
feat, an enviable record of which 
Coach Risedorph and his boys can 
well feel proud. Carnegies victims 
include Wooster, Delaware, Down
town Y, Case, Western Reserve and 
Franklin and Marshall.
The team ' was exceptionally well 
balanced with no outstanding star. 
Ranny Boyer probably enjoyed the 
most successful season from the 
standpoint of individual firsts and 
his breaking of the 1500 meter back
stroke record climaxed a great year. 
PrI Miller was the mainstay of the 
sprinters, and his work in the relay 
50 and 100, piled up many points;
Bill Edwards, the hard-working 
captajn, could not specialize in1 any 
one event as he had to hold him
self ready to ' plug any one of the 
numerous gaps which appeai'cd in the 
ranks during the season. Edwards 
sacrifice of individual honors for 
teamwork was typical of the spirit 
which prcvaded the squad throughout 
the season. Thompson and Dennison, 
the latter ineligible at mid-year, 
handled the - breaststroke in a most 
commendable fashion. Wally Derdync 
was the distance star and  Ted
Plebe Courtmen Complete 
Season By Winning Three
The Plebe floormen had a busy 
closing week and came . through 
with colors flying by taking all 
the games played. Last Tuesday 
the Geneva Reserves were squelch
ed by the Carnegie yearlings with 
score of 29-24. Then on Wed
nesday the up-river boys from Kiski 
were handed their wofst beating of 
the season, 40-21, at the hands of 
the Skibo freshmen. After a hard 
and very exciting contest as a pre
liminary to the Carnegie-Penn State 
game, the Plebes took over the 
youngsters from State College 
33-26.
In . spite , of an unusually tough 
schedule the Plebes have made out 
very well this season. Some idea 
of the comparative strength of this 
years and last years Plebe basketballers may be gathered from 
comparison of their records. 
This season. the Yearlings won 
nine games and lost six. Last 
years Freshmen were victorious in 
sixteen of the twenty tilts played.
Numerals will likely be given to 
nine men of the Plebe squad as 
follows: Carlson, Campbell, Ewalt,
Rigg, Mihm, McCalmon, Beers, 
Dubin and Stritt.

Place In Swim Tourney
Carnegies four entries in the 
Eastern Intercollegiate Association 
swimrriing championships garnered 
enough points to give the Plaid a 
tic for 'fourth place in the final team 
standing. The Skibo scorers were 
Boyer, Miller and Thompson, and 
the eleven points which the trio 
scored rfgairist mdn from New 
York U., Cornell,' Hutgcrs, Lafay
ette and others, was sufficient 
proof of their worth.
The Tartans camc home third 
in the medley relay, the event .be
ing won by Rutgers. Pal Miller 
lived up to local perfdrrnances by 
placing third in both the 50 and 
100 yard free styles, swimming 
against the. cream of the East. 
Boyer'placed second in a fast back
stroke race to climax the Tartan 
scoring.
The championship was won by 
Rutgers University with 31 points. 
New York U came second with 20 
points and Pitts 17 points was 
'enough'to give them a third. Car
negie tied with Lehigh and Lafay
ette . for fourth and Cornell was* 
seventh.
Although old King Basketball is 
tottering on his last legs, his spirit 
is being momentarily revived by the 
many selections of All-Amcrican, AllMythical, and All-What-Not teams, 
picked mostly by the basketball 
scribes who have watched the dif
ferent aggregations play. However, 
the Tartan takes great pleasure in 
announcing an All-Opponent team pick
ed by the five leading Plaid stars 
whose fine f team-work and fighting 
spirit has boosted the Carnegie colors 
high into the basketball world. The 
selections were made by the players 
on the merits . of all-around playing 
and consistency, rather than per
sonal likes and dislikes of their vari
ous opponents.
The team, as pickcd by Messrs. 
Smith, Leonard, Jagnow, Fergus and 
Stentz, lines up as follows:
McDougal . Goldberger Snlcs______
----- Duquesne--------- Temple.Kentucky U.
---------Temple--------- Geneva
Both McDougal and Goldberger 
were described as being deceptive 
passers and shifty dribblers besides 
being very accurate in both short 
and long shots. Sales, of Kentucky 
University was a unamimous choice 
as center of the team because of his 
all around playing. At the guards, 
Aultman of Geneva and OBrien of 
Temple were sure boosts for any 
mans ' team. Both were consistent 
men and very fast..
Of these selections, the only one to 
cause any amount of controversy., was 
Goldberger of Temple. For his posi
tion there were quite a few suggestions1 including Lawry of Pitt, and 
Fitch of Temple. However, Gold, 
bcrgers clever * floor work, and good 
all around playing won for, himself 
the position above the others.
Freshman Track Candidates!
Eastabrooke finished his college div
ing career with an enviable record 
of first, places. Cadmus, ,Frankci La 
Chance, Looney, Treat and Kuhn 
rounded out the Tartan team.
Candidates for freshman track are 
asked to report at th field house some 
time this week. Freshman' who wish 
to become track managers are also 
a<skcd to report at the field house this 
week. The men who becoriic Fresh
man managers have the opportunity 
of becoming the manager of either 
the varsity or freshman track team 
in their senior year and receiving 
a letter.Owing to the. fact that a large 
amount of equipment lias not been re| 
turned by -athletes in the.; past, the 
school has decided that each candidate 
for any sport must make a deposit on 
this equipment. The deposit -will be 
.refunded when the equipment is re
turned at the end of the season.
Francis Scigcl, the Iowa cowboy 
and Pitt gpd star, can -hardly com
plain of thct treatment he is re
ceiving in foreign parts, for the 
Pittsburgh boxing judges seem to 
have taken quite a liking to the burly 
cornhuslccr. Two wbeks ago against 
Cadet Olsen, of the Army, Cowr 
boy was hit with everything but the 
stool, but was awarded a handy de
cision. Last Saturday, Jerry OToole, 
Carnegies star fullback, apparently 
outpointed him arid there seemed to 
be little doubt of the outcome; but 
Seigcl was again awarded the de
cision. Scigels face was a bloody 
smear throughout the final round, 
but 5 Referee Carlson made no move 
to stop the bout. The Cowboy made 
frequent wild lunges in Jerrys gen
eral direction, but they rarely found 
their mark, and Francis more, often 
suffered from sharp right and left 
counter blows delivered at close 
range.
This bout incidently decided the 
meet in favor of the University of 
Pittsburgh, 4-3, and seemed to sub
stantiate the statement that the Pitt 
boxing team can lose everywhere 
but in Pittsburgh.
In a bout that nearly equaled the 
Seigel-OToole set-to in thrills, Tom 
Waldron, Plaid light-heavy ace, polish
ed off Arthur Sekay, Panther foot
ball player, in two stanzas. Sekay 
came in swinging hard, and *for a
while, it looked as though Tom might 
find himself in trouble before the 
evening was over. In the second 
round, however, he ducked under 
one oi Sckays clumsy swings and 
completely finished his man with ter
rific uppercuts. The Pitt boxer was 
out for nearly ten minutes. Waldron 
looked to be in splendid condition in 
spite of continued illnesses which 
have kept him out of the ring most 
of the season.
Captain Henry Carr and Royal 
Wertz, fighting in the 145 pound 
and 115 pound classes respectively 
gave classy exhibitions of boxing 
skill in defeating their opponents. 
Carrs long range left jab. and hard 
right crosses seemed too much for 
Henry Martin of the Pitt squad. 
Wertz had McCarrcll, Panther fly
weight, under control throughout the 
bout and only continued clinching
saved the Pitt lad -from a knockout 
in the third.
Atlas, 125 pound boxer, found 
Nemlicks reach too great an obstacle 
to overcome and lost on a technical 
kayo in the final round. BertPouncey, 
who was given the emergency call
only last week, met a similar fate
from Mario Rubbo, one of Pitts 
best. Fraser Hellegcrs, Skibo light
weight, fought off his opponents
rushes repeatedl}', and showed a de
cided improvement over his former 
appearances.

BACK TO EARTH
Every one knows how difficult the 
past two years have been, both eco
nomically and financially. Every writer 
of the present day is engaged in at
tacking the problem of the depres
sion from, some angle. Some very in
teresting changes have been brought 
about through the agcnc3r of this in
ternational calamity. Everywhere one 
finds significant changes.
In the larger cities there has ap
peared a deplorable situation. Many 
people, feeling that there is little to 
hope for, have tried to drown their 
thoughts in a constant whirl of 
gayety. Witness the gay week-end 
parties of New York City, and the 
opening of the night clubs in Florida 
to which patrons are taken, via air
plane only to be whisked away, a
few hours later to some other gay 
and glittering scene of amusement.
On the other hand, a stabilizing 
force seems to be at work among 
the majority of the people. More 
and more people are trying to find, 
ways and means of making their 
greatly reduced incomes cover their 
multitudinous wants. Department 
stores and merchants arc offering
merchandise that represents real values 
considering the prices. Rooms arc be
ing offered at reduced rates. Restaur
ants arc offering combination dinners 
that arc full meals but which cost 
less. One ,of the greatest changes, 
no doubt, is the training of the 
peoples power of discrimination. Peo
ple arc not only asking that they re
ceive their moneys worth, but are 
demanding it. The result is that 
quality is being stressed.
The theaters arc undergoing a de
cided change. Take as an example, 
of the eighty-six theaters in New
York, only about one-third of them
arc now open. Plays and revues are 
produced in rapid succession and pass 
into history as failures unless they 
really have a definite appeal to their 
audiences. The result is firmer weed
ing out of the poor plays and the 
gradual raising of the theatrical 
standards. This is rather hard on 
the directors and play-wrights, but a 
good thing for the public.
Books come in for the change 
.too. The publishers today arc pub
lishing only books which they feel 
will definitely appeal to the public. 
When one considers that even good 
books are receiving only a fair cir
culation, it is easy to see that the 
poorer sort of fiction has no chance 
at all.
And so, with the habit of walking 
to work on the increase, and people 
actually seeking to buy that which 
they formerly payed twice as much 
for, it seems as if we arc all being

NIGHT ENGINEERS 
TO DANCE SATURDAY
Event Marks Change From 
Smoker to Dance and 
Card Party
Saturday night Thistle Hall is 
to be the scene of the first dance 
given by the Night College of 
Engineering. The new hall will 
furnish an appropriate setting for 
the affair and should go a long 
way in helping to make the dancc 
popular in succeeding years.
In addition to dancing, the com
mittee has made arrangements for 
cards (500 and bridge) as an 
added attraction in the evenings 
entertainment. This arrangement 
should be of especial interest to 
those who do not dancc, but who 
wish to enjoy an evening on the 
campus.
A post card has been mailed out 
to all the night students registered 
in the engineering school .which is 
intended to serve as an invitation 
and ticket of admittance to . the 
party. Invitations, have also been 
sent out to special guests. In qase 
a night engineering student has not 
received one of these special cards, 
his registration card will admit him 
to the affair.
Thistle Hall is a room which has 
been added to a section of the 
gymnasium which houses the swim
ming pool. Entrance to the hall 
is made from Woodlawn Avenue 
by a new walk which has been 
constructed between Skibo Inn and 
the Womens Gymnasium.
Several committees have been 
appointed4 to take care of the ar
rangements so that all will be in 
readiness for the party which is 
scheduled to be held on Saturday 
evening. All committee members 
are requested to report at Thistle 
I-Iall on Saturday afternoon at 2 
p. m. to make final pneparations 
for the dance.
PANNING
In order to succccd in these hectic 
days it, appears that one has only to 
take a pencil and start digging up 
dirt about some one and letting it 
fly. The newspapers arc evidently 
doing their best to find columnists 
who have a spicy way of telling how 
so and so and somebody' else have, 
been doing this and that. There is 
Mr. Winchells Wandering Wally 
who every Tuesday, Thursday and 
Saturday clutters up almost half of 
an already messy program telling 
about Greta Garbo dodging, reporters 
and how Clark Gable is a wow with 
the ladies. Between times he sends 
out on the air what he hopes are 
mirth-provoking platitudes conbcrning 
Ben Bernie, the Old Maestro. Ben, 
of course, is always ready to reply in 
turn. If it wasn't all in fun it cer
tainly would be serious. Luckily both 
are good friends. Then there is to 
be found in almost every paper, 
men and women who, not being able 
to write anything else, spend their 
time'and that of their readers fool-' 
ishly by relating some back fence 
gossip. Actors and radio performers 
have even, tried their hand at mud 
slinging.
Perhaps there is no harm in this 
battle of the gossips, but usually 
where mud is being stirred it is 
being made ready to be tossed. 
Dramatic and literary critics rave 
about playwrights and novelists and 
they in turn bitterly complain of the 
critics. And, to make matters worse, 
a congressman has attacked the 
critics because they did not accept 
his play. Now the critics arc after 
him because he writes plays instead 
of attending to his other business.
So it goes, I think Ill go home 
tonight and turn on the radio and 
sec what is the latest with Winchell.

I got minethe little post card 
telling me of the dance which we 
engineers are going to. throw on 
the night of the 19th at "Thustle 
HallScotch, you knowpronounc
ed like "K in fig or something. 
Speaking of scotch, I hope none of 
/the other two schools show their 
faces at this party of ours be
cause if they do, I am afraid there 
will be no room for us. We have 
to look after our own interests 
first and .then, maybe .... Of 
course, it is going to be some 
party, and I don't mean maybe. 
All the mechanicals, electricals, 
physicals, civils, metallurgical, and 
all the other "icals" will be there 
in' full force to show the campus 
how we rigineers can step. No 
stopping us when we get started. 
I tell you, boys, we are there. So, 
mark this Saturday night on your 
social calendar, as Ill be wantin 
you to swap a dance.
 Overheard a conversation the 
other day which brought me to the 
conclusion that when it comes to 
slip-stick instruction wc have some 
able-bodied embryo professors reg
istered in this class. No trick at 
all to the "mechanics" ,of sliding 
up and' down the rule to find out 
how' it is done. Why, they

it would be interesting to peep

sion to see how much these em
bryo prpfs know.

before . . . still I go on doing 
otherwise. Yes, I realize that we 
will have final examinations very 
soon, but why speak of them this 
far in advance. Let the pesky 
things alone for a while. I realize 
the fact that I should get down to 
business and make better grades, 
but how can I, when' there is so 
much to take1 my mind away from 
the problems.  I have three dates 
a week, and two nights which are 
occupied in trying to get out of 
assignments so when Friday eve
ning comes around I have accom

I say again, I realize that

No, the fancy fixtures havent 
^disappeared from the entrances, to 
the Arts building. Now that my 
attention was called to the fixtures. 
I must say that they1 are indeed 
out of keeping with the surround
ing. It is a wonder some one 
with an artistic frame of mind 
didnt notice these appendixes sus
pended over: the entrances and
start a contest to design fixtures 
which would show the Arts off to 
better advantage. 'Maybe the artis
tic value of a new light will be

future and we will have new lights 
to guide our steps when we enter

Concluding Resume of Impressions Gained When Viewing Exhibit.
I have read somewhere that every 
one wears a habitual mask, and only 
at certain moments docs one drop 
that mask; thus it remains for the 
experienced portrait painter to catch 
the true expression of the charac
ter of his subject at such a mo
ment.
Now there is a self portrait of 
Air. Simboli of our own Arts School, 
which reveals the likeness of the 
Simboli that I'know; but I compare 
it with a memory picture of an
other portrait of himself that won 
honors at a previous exhibition, and 
which reveals a total stranger to all 
that know him personally. Well, per
haps in his prize winning portrait 
he caught himself unmasked.
My attention is next focussed on 
the prize winning group of paintings 
by Mr. Hilton also of the Arts 
School. They indicate first of all-his 
clear knowledge of figure composi
tion, and his ability to amplify a 
simple theme. I cannot fail to notice 
how carefully everything is drawn,, 
and .the unimportant details wisely 
omitted. He uses mostly warm gray 
tones and enlivens them with vigor
ous whites.
Comfort by Milan Petrovits 
shows cine , of the models of his 
Models of. the Artist at work, and 
it is very likely his wife. Vincent 
Nesbert has ..an arresting "Dancer 
on this , same wall, that is vivid with 
the intensity of life.
The well known painter of slum 
scenes Samuel Filner, is represented 
with Brady Street Blues a pro
found work, and it greatly amuses me 
to see how quickly people recognize 
the familiar scene, and immediately 
assume a critical attitude as if to 
say this is drawn wrong and that 
doesnt belong there.
"Esta by Lillian Kimball seems 
to indicate that the' famous portrait 
painter Sej'f ferts style is being copied, 
nevertheless it is delightfully inter
esting.
Jack of all trades, John Kane, has 
a picture called "Day of1 Rest, and 
even though it is considered the best 
of his; group, it is just another pic
ture to me. He is apparently afraid 
to try something new and give us 
critics .something to talk about.
In another gallery is Nine Planets 
and a Million by D. Owen Stephens 
which reveals enthusiasm and the 
sincerity of his love of the stars. 
All of his paintings use the stars for 
a theme, and I can picture Mr. 
Stephens peering studiously through 
his homemade tclcscope from his 
observatory probably atop the roof 
of his home.
A most interesting "Still Life is 
shown by Christian Walters, with a 
skillfully painted antique torso domi
nating the setup. His other paintings 
are really poetic iri cssencc, so warm 
and full of tender emotions.
It seems that we night students 
arc also ably represented. Theres 
Sylvio Regutti with several interest
ing still lifes; his Study in Shoes 
is commendable for its pleasing tones. 
John Janccrvicz, another night stu
dent, has a bold still life. John may 
yet develop into a famous colorist 
if he continues his experiments with 
colors. Ke.<*p it up boys, I too, am 
planning to exhibit next year with a 
painting called "Suicide with Pop 
Gun.
Oryill Kipp, who isnt a night 
student, but we all know him never
theless, . has two flower paintings 
that are worthy of praise, and several 
etchings. Mr. Warner also expresses 
his love for speeding locomotives 
through the 'medium (of etchings.
Well, as much as I woiild like to 
continue -my sprightly art commcnt, 
the editor deems its advisable

opportunity to introduce a bill into

those art critics who have received

who enjoy the good things of life...

We Believe in Continuing Sports At Carnegie
Intercollegiate sports have again become the object of 
criticism from various writers in this country, on the 
charges of' professionalism and over-emphasis. The usual 
number of reform addicts have taken up the challenge, 
many of them with doubtful sincerity, being interested more 
in notoriety, and are trying to focus public attention on 
what they declare to be the evils of collegiate athletics. 
Editorial writers, some on college papers as well as the city 
newspapers, have seized upon the case with the enthusiasm 
of a news reporter handling a kidnaping story. Thus 
many columns of type pre-destined to recount the evils .of 
politics, war, and hoarding, have been used to inform the 
world of the unhappy situation in college athletics.
The sentiment at Carnegie is not in sympathy with the 
critics of college sports. The student body is satisfied with 
the showing of their teams, and proud of the spirit for 
which these men have become famous. The fact that the 
athletes receive favors for their effort does not bring any 
discontent or conscientious objections. All men who be
come specialists in their chosen activity receive such favors 
whether athletes or editors, and the sport or publication 
can only be handled properly by so doing.
The basketball season closed, last week with the best 
record of any squad in the same sport in recent years at 
Carnegie.- Congratulations are being given the team and 
the coaches, and rightly so for they have distinguished 
themselves in a fine manner. Without disparaging this 
years squad any, a great deal of credit is due the men who 
decided two years ago to modernize Carnegies basketball 
organization.
In the eyes of present critics any attempt to make col
lege sports modern in its business methods constitutes an 
evil. But is it truly improper to provide a large student 
body, with entertainment as interesting as a good sports, 
program? Granting the students an opportunity to take 
their necessary diversion through the medium 'of sports, 
although but ohe factor in. favor of intercollegiate athletic 
events, should be sufficient justification for their existence.
In addition there is, the occasion for the normal develop
ment of school spirit offered in varsity competition that 
cannot develop from the most satisfactory system of inter
mural sports. Some individuals of the disinteresting, 
sophisticated type consider school spirit as an evidence of 
adolesence, and disdain attempts to foster this group feeling 
from which loyalty and pride develop. Fortunately this 
unhappy group is quite small in numbers; for bringing 
them to a more healthy state of mind constitutes . a con
siderable problem in modern .education.
A number of leading educators have declared that next 
year the, sports competition at their schools shall be limited 
to intermural activities entirely within their own campus.
It is unfortunate that any school, whether prompted by 
economic distress or conscientious objections, should rely \ 
upon rivalry within the organization to obtain the atmos
phere which distinguishes a college from other commercial 
enterprises. The' over-emphasis problem will be certainly 
settled at such schools, but the results hardly merit the cure.
There are many who declare that college athletics are 
subsidized with the secret belief of aiding in advertising 
the names of the college^ and thereby abetting the enroll
ment. There are perhaps more than a few of the small col
leges in the Pittsburgh district which foster this idea. Sol 
Metzger, football coach and writer, explodes what he terms 
the football fallacy. In a recent magazine article he 
shatters the illusion, fondly nursed by almost all who have 
not taken time to analyze the facts, that winning athletic 
teams increase the enrollment of students, the wealth and 
the prestige of our universities.
Metzger ^ wrote' or directly interviewed the administra
tive, academic and athletic directors of more than eighty 
outstanding American colleges and universities, and pro
pounded this question, What do victorious football teams 
actually win for the schools they represent? With one ex
ception, all questioned, agreed that an unemotional survey 
of the situation offered little, if anything, to support the 
common theory that to acquire nation-wide prestige for 
any college all that is required is a consistently victorious eleven.
He uses as examples such notable institutions of learn
ings as Notre Dame, the University of Chicago and Center 
College. Notre Dame, for instance, came into great promi
nence in 1924. In 1923-2-1, the year before tlijs school rose 
to its greatest football glory the enrollment had been 512 
undergraduates. In 1925-2(5, the next year after the big 
year, the enrollment was 365. The average increase before 
the year 1924-25 was 255. The average increase for the five years following was 200.
Center College made a sensational record between the 
years of 1919 and 1924. Yet the increase at this small de
nominational ^ institution of Kentucky has been slow and 
labored and in the year after its famous and unlooked for 
victory over Harvard the enrollment was increased by just 
sixteen. In the last three years Center College has received 
little attention from the sports writers but the increase in

Nice Fighting
The arena was fairly well packed with, a very enthusiastic and noisy crowd last Saturday' nite. Not enough dressed formal to fill all the choice ringside seats but a good bunch of them at that. Wertz put up a snappy battle but couldnt do much with his opponent hugging him all the time. Henry Carr did nice work. His tooth guard makes him look very fo.rmidablc. Jerry OToole put up a swell scrap but didnt get much credit for*it. Likewise Fraser Hellegers. Waldron topped off the end of the match with a nice knockout thus sending the customers home happy. There was good red blood to spare in several of the bouts. In the near future there will be as. fine a set of Intercollegiate boxing matches as can . be seen anywhere right in our own Gym. Tech took the short end ,of both encounters with our Pitt friends last week but did themselves proud at that.* * * *
After the Fight
With their baser appetites for blood satiated Saturday evening the formal contingent and someof the rest turned to the more aesthetic sport ofdancing. A tiny couple put on a continuous ex
hibition of fancy dancehall steps rarely seen in these woods. . . . Billy Conway was responsible for some attempted close harmony over bottles of pop in the Rathskelle?. The performance brought a shower of small change; who kept it is not known. Jimmy Leonard contributed his penny and true to form made a basket in a glass without even looking. . . . Miss Green observed several times for the benefit of a certain couple that thechairs in the lobby were a trifle small to accommodate two. . . . The Phi Kaps joined the Sigma Nus for , the moment in a good old ring around the rosy. . . . Will Ryshanek and his lads did right well. The drummer was a particular attraction.... A number of Pitt people at the dance, some looking for the free dance announced in the Pitt Weekly by mistake.* * * *
Hail to Pitt!
The Pitt R. O. T. C. deserves considerable credit for the highly successful Military Ball that it sponsored last Friday. Two famous orchestras in the 17th floor of-the William Penn and favors, at the price of three dollars, should draw a crowd even in these days, and it did. Well over a thousand couples attended. ' And such color! Blue Pitt uniforms, Carnegies khaki uniforms and boots and gowns of every imaginable color. Not onlj* three orchestras but blues signers and what not, too. There seemed to be half as many Tech uniforms as Pitt uniforms. And who should we bump into .but Admiral Byrd himself. Carnegie Tech co-eds 
Were conspicuous by their presence, in droves. . . . * * * *

Now that Carnegie has gone modern and inaugurated smoking rooms in the girls dorms the aforementioned rooms get bluer with smoke than old Petes Pool Parlor on Saturday nite. The fire department has been warned that any smoke clouds emanating from the dorms during certain hours indicate only that the girls are consuming their very necessary cigarets. . . . Miss Winchester was credited with an unusual degree according to the front page of this sheet last week. ..An engineering

Though the iconoclasm of Bernard

his cabled pronouncements to the

tempered by a morti philosophic ob
servation of human nature im the dis

carried revolutionary ideas out of the

Socialistic societies andturned them 
into paradoxes for the characters in 
his plays had to be granted a concep

not as it checks up with reality. If 
he made a palpable hit," in attribut

of hypocrisy, one laughed at the

were not with many men a,compelling 
force in eycry day life.
"Too True To Be Good reveals 
him at the patriarchal age surveying 
the world that the Ireat War has 
wrought, not any too confident that 
all is well, even though the younger 
generation is feeding on Shavian 
ideas. His young folk kick over the 
traces, running away from family 
obligations, or social position, or re
spectability, shouting, Henceforth, 
my gates are open to real life, bring 
what it may. The intrusive care of 
anxious parents," the officious con
cern of family clergymen and all the 
betes noires of the Shaw of old are 
as pronounced as ever. There is still 
the continual-violation of that sacred 
aura which surrounds every living 
soul like the halo surrounding the 
heads of saints in religious pictures. 
For what sense is there in this 
world, of hazards, disasters,  elations 
and victories, except as a field for 
the adventures of the life everlasting? 
But while the younger generation has 
heeded the advice to go in for ad
ventures, do they motivate them by 
any thought of the life everlasting? 
Shaw apparently is a bit disillusioned. 
Even th' Elderty Lady has found 
out; that when she dressed herself 
up to accord with the modes of the 
modernists world she has no place 
to go. How am I to behave in a 
world that's just the opposite of 
everything I was told about it?
He puts, the situation in a nut
shellwhen the Burglar speaks to the 
Patient.- In her (the Nurses) lily 
hand was a copy of The Ladys Pic
torial. It contained an illustrated ac
count of your jewels. Can you guess 
what Sweetie said to me as she gazed 
at the soft majesty of the mountains 
and bathed her soul in the beauty of 
the sunset? Yes, she said-, Popsy, 
we must pinch that necklace. Exact
ly. ... I said, If that girl had any 
sense shed steal the necklace herself. 
. . . Sell it; and have a glorious 
spree with the price. The younger 
generation is selling the necklace all 
right and having a glorious spree, 
but having it to no purpose. It had 
always been Shaws inhuman notion 
that cutting adrift from the experi
ence of the race somehow would be
get a courageous individuality of selfuilderstanding. He is not so sure of 
it now. "Here is a man with all the 
miracles of the universe to stagger 
his imagination, says one of his 
characters, and all the problems of 
human destiny to employ his mind, 
and he. goes out and shoots an inno
cent policeman because he can think 
of nothing more interesting to do.
Carnegie Kate Says:
It is about time the Skibo bridge 
games were climaxed with a real 
campus tournament. Ping pong 
promises to be the next in line if 
the fraternities ever get money 
enough to buy a set.
In exasperated protest the Patient 
cries, I am exercising my freedom; 
Thefreedom you preached . . .Ive 
got nowhere to go . . . Im miser
able.
Much nakedness has been won. You 
may now. throw away the outer gar
ment of your souls; the manners, the 
morals, the decencies. Yet e\fdn the 
Burglar (shrinks from the revelation 
as from 'f'a blast of death. Since 
the war the lower centres have be
come vocal; they shout nakedness 
all over the place, but they leave 
us no place to live, no certainties, no 
workable morality, no heavenr n<? 
hell, no commandments, and no 
God.
It is to his 'son that Shaw gives 
the last word in the play. Aubrey 
stands midway between youth and 
age, like a man who has missed his 
train. I have no Bible; no creed; 
the war has shot both out of my 
hands. The w'ord Not, the attitude 
of negation, is pervasive. Men will 
no longer kneel and believe. Is . No 
enough? For a boy, yes; for a man, 
never. Arp we any less obsessed 
with a belief. when we are denying 
it than when we were affirming ,it? 
No: I must have affirmations to.
preach. It .is significant to have 
from the' silyery-haired Shaw a play 
that closes on the note, I have lost 
my nerve and am intimidated; all I 
know is that I must find the way of 
life.
This is not to say that the Shaw 
of the bristling red beard is eating 
his words of bygone jrears. On the 
contrary, his story is but a frame 011 
which to stretch in fresh combina
tions the strands of his most familiar 
doctrines. And as if to show how 
alert a man of seventy-five can be, 
his dialogue not only is more col
loquial than it ever has been but 
bashes about American,' slang as 
though he found zest in it. He still 
has a penchant for violent lovemaking at first sight as comic ma
terial. "Whats the game? asks one 
character in astonishment. The game 
is that youre my fancy. I love you. 
Shaw perhaps has best explained him
self through Aubrey: My gift is 
divine: it is not limited by my pett3' 
personal convictions. It is a gift of 
lucidity as well as of eloquence 
. . . If I can get a moving dramatic 
effect out oFlt and preach a really 
splendid sermon about it, my gift 
takes' possession of me and obliges 
me to sail in and do it.

prestige is not endangered by the actions of any of her

OUR VACATIONS
A revie\y of the college year now 
in progression reveals that our vaca
tion periods are not entirely satis
factoryin their distribution for bene
fiting the Carnegie student to the 
fullest advantage. Of course, for the 
larger part this arrangement cannot 
be improved, for no authority has 
jurisdiction over the event of na
tional holidays.
Nevertheless, there is one portion 
of the school year which is singular
ly devoid of respites, although the 
assignments are in general unduly 
heavynamely, those few intense 
weeks just before and during final 
examinations. It is at this time that 
many instructors realize that the 
semesters goal has not. been attained, 
and consequently. compel their stu
dents. to bear a heavier load, that 
other departments are . issuing com
prehensive review assignments, and 
that hordes of students arc frantical
ly attempting to make up the backwork. and laboratory experiments 
which were left to do tomorrow.
It is a peculiar coincidence that this 
period is concomitant with an alarm
ing increase in absences due to ill
ness, which; if not directly, are at 
least indirectly attributable to the 
physical strain and diminished bodily 
resistivity caused by lack of sleep 
and prolonged studying of these few 
weeks. Indeed, this was true to such 
an extent this j-ear that rumors were 
spread about the campus that a vaca
tion interval was to be inserted be
tween semesters to allow the large 
number of sick to recuperate. .
Many educational institutions, Har
vard and Massachusettes Institute of 
Technology for example, have recog
nized the necessity of granting their 
students ample time, for leisurely re
views, thereby taking a step toward 
eliminating that notorious phenomena 
called cramming, and have accord
ingly permitted two or three days of 
suspended classes between the end
ing of the semester and the begin
ning of final examinations.
Such an example could be followed 
by the Carnegie administrators with 
advantage. To secure the necessary 
days, the allotted Christmas vacation 
could be decreased by a correspond
ing amount, which, it will be admit
ted, would not prevent those stu
dents who live in distant states from 
spending their only. vacation of the 
school year at home. The sanction 
of a majority of the student body 
should first be obtained.

cording to eye-witnesses of-the af
fair, a professor at LELAND 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY walked 
into an English class at 9:05 a. 
m. 011 a recent morning, and set 
about the usual procedure of . call
ing the roll. Although the room 
was well filled with students, not a 
single syllabic was uttered in re
sponse to his careful pronunciation 
of a long list of names. At the 
end of the roll, the professor 
looked up in confusion and discov
ered that he had walked into the 
wrong room. He beat a hasty re
treat amid much snickering.

last Wednesday the society voted to 
handle all the exhibits of the Mechanican Engineering Department for 
Exhibition Night.
These exhibitions include not. gnly 
the work of the straight mechanical 
cdiirse, but also the work of the aer
onautical engineers as well as the Heat 
Option 'Mechanicals. Fred Latham, 
corresponding secretary of Pi Tau 
Sigma,: is president of the committee 
named to handle the exhibits. Joe 
Bcnsel is the junior, representative, 
arid Igor Karassik is the senior aer
onautical representative.
The meeting Wednesday night was 
the' first of a series of dinner meet
ings which the society has planned. 
Professors Estep and Blaisdcll. of 
the Mechanical Department:, were at 
the meeting and spoke on Grading 
Systems. Pi Tau Sigma is at. present 
sporisoring a comparison of the 
grades of students in the different de
