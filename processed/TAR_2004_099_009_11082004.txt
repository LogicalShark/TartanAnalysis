Political pundit Carville 
analyzes recent election
by Mustafa Khan
Staffwriter
Speaking after Presidential 
candidate John Kerrys con
cession, political commenta
tor James Carville delivered 
his analysis of the election to a 
crowded Heinz Hall. Carville, 
featured as the second lecturer 
in Robert Morris Universitys 
Speaker Series, touched on the 
shortcomings of Kerrys cam
paign and the future direction of 
the Democratic Party.
James Carville is a very astute 
observer of American politics 
and one of the top Democratic 
political consultants in the coun
try. He is excellent at making 
incisive commentary on the state 
of politics in our nation, said 
Jonathan Mendelson, a junior 
in computer science and social 
and decision sciences and the 
principal organizer of Carnegie 
Mellons College Democrats.
Carville, considered one 
of todays best known politi
cal consultants according to 
the lecture program, pointed to 
Kerrys lack of a coherent narra
tive that could unite and appeal 
to Americans.
According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Carville addressed 
students at Robert Morris 
University earlier in the day, stat
ing that his party is in a state of 
confusion. At Heinz Hall in the 
evening, Carville noted that the 
Democratic party now faces the 
challenge of transforming itself 
from an accumulation of inter
est groups into a more mean
ingful party. At times frustration 
over Kerrys loss bled through 
to Carvilles speech, as Carville 
voiced his shock that Americans 
re-elected a leader despite a 
soft economy, a disastrous war, 
and three lost debates. 
Regardless of his admitted 
disappointment over the elec
tion, Carville, a commentator on 
CNNs Crossfire, was able to inject 
amusement into his speech. 
Apologizing in advance for his 
lack of preparedness due to his 
frenzied work schedule, Carville 
was met with laughter when he 
said, Ive heard of introductions 
that need no speaker, but Im 
more of a speaker without an 
introduction.
Carvilles insights were 
a mix of humor and distress. 
Dwelling on his dismay towards 
the Democratic Partys failure to

Best Human 
takes place 
on Saturday
by Isabel Gardocki
Junior Staffwriter
You have always known that 
you were good  or maybe even 
better  but have you ever sus
pected that you were the best 
overall, out of everyone? asks 
the Best Human contests web 
page. Those who suspect so may 
be crowned Best Human in a 
competition that will take place 
at 6:30 pm on Saturday in the 
Connan Room of the UC.
Best Human is a pageant that 
builds up humanity rather than 
breaking it down, said Ryan 
England, one of the organizers 
of the event and a junior in civil 
and environmental engineer
ing and engineering and public 
policy. It brings different aes
thetics, world views, and values 
together in a competition that is 
fun and friendly.
According to England, rather 
than judging only men or 
affirming women who conform 
to a Western concept of beauty, 
Best Human seeks to make the 
point that people of all differ
ent types are beautiful and all 
sorts of things make them that 
way, while poking fun at con
ventional pageants and their 
proceedings.
Contestants will be tested on 
intelligence, creativity, survival 
skills, and hunting and gather
ing ability, all under the watch
ful eyes of a panel composed of 
experts and professionals best 
able to discern the characteris
tics of the Best Human, explains 
Joshua Halipern, a junior in 
computer science. According to 
Halipern, unlike typical beauty 
pageants there will be no shal
low people answering superfi
cial questions.
The winner will be given a 
crown and all other participants 
will be awarded prizes. The Best 
Human will then move on to 
represent all of humanity in the 
Best Mammal contest.
Every member of the CMU 
community is eligible to partici
pate, but an application must 
be filled out beforehand. These 
applications can be picked up 
at the Information Desk of the 
University Center or submitted 
electronically through www. 
besthuman.org. A briefing ses
sion will be held for all contes
tants this week to inform them 
of the schedule and procedure 
of the evening.

Last Thursday author and 
activist Frances Moore Lappe 
delivered the keynote address for 
the 2004 International Festival 
at Carnegie Mellon. Her speech, 
titled Exploding the Myths of 
Hunger One Pop-Tart at a Time, 
focused on global perceptions of 
world hunger and efforts aimed 
at reducing the problem that, 
according to thehungersite.com, 
affects over one billion people 
worldwide.
After being introduced by festi
val coordinator Emily Half, Lappe 
asked the audience, Why hun
ger? Lappe has written several 
books on the question, including 
Diet for a Small Planet and her 
most recent publication, Hopes 
Edge: The Next Diet for a Small 
Planet.
Lappe explained that she first 
attempted to answer the ques
tion Why hunger? in graduate 
school, during a period when 
experts thought that the world 
food supply could not keep up 
with the growing population. In 
fact, said Lappe, there was more 
than enough food to make us all 
chubby.... Hunger is not caused 
by a scarcity of food, but by a 
scarcity of democracy.
Lappe went on to explain that
in a country where one in five 
families in Oregon and New York 
City do not get enough to eat, an 
estimated 16 pounds of grain is 
used to produce one pound of 
processed steak. Lappe also said 
that India, which has the highest 
concentration of hungry citizens 
on the planet, keeps tons of sur
plus grain in storehouses while 
officials look for export markets.
Wherever one finds hunger,
Lappe said, democracys promise 
is still unfulfilled.
According to Lappe, most demo
cratic failures in the United States 
were the result of an American 
frame of orientation that cre
ated false realities. Citing Erich 
Fromms book The Anatomy of 
Human Destructiveness, Lappe said 
that Americans see themselves as 
competitive, ego-centered con
sumers ... and that we are too 
flawed to make decisions for the 
common good. As a result, Lappe 
said we rely on the magic of an 
impersonal market.
Lappe also cited our culture 
of fear as a reason for allow
ing hunger to exist. Were afraid 
were going to be left out, she 
said. For this reason, individuals 
rarely attempt to make an impact 
outside their own sphere of influ
ence.
However, Lappe also mentioned

CMU police alert students 
of local armed robberies
by Brittany McCandless
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon University 
Police have received informa
tion from Pittsburgh Police 
that a string of armed robber
ies occurred near campus over 
the Halloween weekend. CMPD 
released a campus-wide safety 
alert that listed six robberies that 
took place between 11 pm and 1 
am in Bloomfield, Shadyside, and 
central Oakland.
According to the alert, a 
Carnegie Mellon University stu
dent was a victim in one of the 
street robberies.
In five of the cases, the sus
pects approached the victims
from behind or the side, while in 
one case the victim was walking 
behind the suspects.... In all six 
cases, the victims were ordered 
or forced to lie face-down on the 
ground at gunpoint. The victims 
in three of the robberies were 
women walking alone or with 
another female friend, the alert 
stated.
Victims have described the sus
pects as a black female with medi
um to dark complexion, 17-20 
years old, and a black male with 
medium complexion, age 17-25.
Campus Police urge students to 
be aware, particularly those who 
live off campus and are familiar 
with the areas. Police also encourSee ROBBERIES, page A4
CMIPAC and Hillel hold 
vigil in Rabins memory
by Louisa Kinoshi
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Israel 
Public Affairs Commitee 
(CMIPAC) and Hillel had a vigil 
ceremony in memory of former 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin on Thursday night. The 
groups jointly took the Fence on 
Wednesday and Thursday.
CMIPAC is a new organiza
tion on campus which addresses 
supposed misconceptions about 
Israel. We want people to know 
whats going on in Israel: that it 
is a place of freedom where gay
rights are acknowleged and more 
women serve on the supreme 
court, said Rachel Svinkelstin, 
president of CMIPAC and Hillel.
On Wednesday night both 
groups painted the Fence black in 
memory of Rabins death. All day 
Thursday, materials were distrib
uted at the Fence on Rabins life. 
On Thursday evening at 6:30 a 
vigil ceremony was held. Students 
from both CMU and the University 
of Pittsburgh attended.
At the vigil, Rabins biography

Activist group, college students protest circus with a hunger strike
Students break voting records
After waiting more than two hours for extra provisional ballots to be delivered to the Schenley polling location, 
Veena Thomas, a senior psychology major, cast her vote. The Schenley polling spot had been given only 12 pro
visional ballots, but ended up needing more than 20 as over 1000 voters turned out to the location, which has in 
past years seen an average of 300 voters.

On Wednesday, a group of 
i more than two dozen animal 
rights activists assembled out
side the Mellon Arena to protest 
the Ringling Bros, and Barnum & 
Bailey Circuss treatment of their 
performing animals. Seven stu
dents involved in the protest also 
participated in a hunger strike. 
The hunger strike, which lasted 
three days, brought together 
members of activist group Voices 
for Animals as well as University 
of Pittsburgh, Chatham College, 
and Carnegie Mellon University 
students. Each of the seven stu
dents represented a particu
lar Ringling Bros, and Barnum
& Bailey circus animal that had 
recently died.
Candice Zawoiski, a member of 
the Voices for Animals group, was
one of the seven activists who 
participated in the hunger strike. 
Zawoiski commented that the 
hunger strike was a bit uncom
fortable and left me hungry, but 
it was nothing compared to the 
misery that the [circus] animals 
endure for a lifetime.
Zawoiski claimed that Voices 
for Animals launched the hunger 
strike in order to raise awareness 
about the neglect and outright 
abuse that the Ringling Brothers 
and Barnum & Bailey circus ani
mals are put through.
P.J. McKowsky, a member of 
the Voices for Animals group who 
also participated in the hunger 
strike, echoed Zawoiskis com
ments about the minor discom
fort the hunger strikers endured 
as compared to the reported pain 
of the circus animals. McKowsky 
added that the hunger strike gave 
the participants time to reflect 
about what the animals suffer
when so much of what is good 
and natural to them is taken 
away in captivity.
Michael Croland, the president 
of Voices for Animals at Carnegie 
Mellon and a senior English 
major, was among the partici
pants in the protest outside the 
Mellon Arena.
Croland, who received an 
internship at People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals (PETA) 
last year, says, The protests got 
many people to realize the inher
ent suffering Ringling animals 
go through. These animals are 
ripped from their families and 
natural habitats, beaten until they 
learn absurd tricks, and forced 
to perform against veterinarians 
advice. They are deprived of any 
sense of freedom, much like VFA 
activists were deprived of food.

We take many of our civil liberties 
for granted here at Carnegie Mellon; 
ten years ago students learned to 
respect them the hard way. The 
University, partially in a response to 
a fradulent SURG study that claimed 
that 83.5 percent of Usenet news
groups were pornographic, censored 
the Internet.
The story of the fradulent study 
has become one of the most famous 
elements of Internet lore. Marty 
Rimm, then a CMU undergrad, pub
lished what is arguably one of the 
most clear-cut examples of faulty 
and unethical research. He spied 
on users Andrew accounts, plagia
rized, misrepresented his findings, 
misleadingly represented his study 
as if it had been performed by a 
faculty member, fabricated informa
tion, and didnt bother to inform 
his subjects of what he was doing. 
None of this information became 
clear at the time, as he kept his paper 
secret and did not expose it to peer 
review. What Rimm was able to do 
was align himself with conservative 
social groups who wanted to shut 
down pornographic websites and 
convince people that the Internet 
was full of pornography.
When questioned, Rimm was 
never able to verify his claims about 
Usenets being 83.5 percent por
nographic. Yet evidence was not 
necessary for Carnegie Mellon to 
make the decision to remove access 
to over 80 newsgroups. Glancing 
through the Tartan archives, the list 
of newsgroups is somewhat surpris
ing. While some choices, such as 
altsex.bondage, are obvious, some 
are downright confusing, such as 
alLsex.woody-allen. Furthermore, it 
remains unclear what threat alt.sex. 
fetish.startrek posed, and perhaps alt. 
sex.bondage.sco.unix can shed some 
light on SCOs ongoing lawsuits.
On the tenth anniversary of this 
action, Carnegie Mellon students are 
free to browse any of the alt.sex 
subtrees, as the administration soon 
reversed the decision after students 
protested. Yet the faulty research 
continued to have a huge impact; it 
was cited on the floor of the United 
States Senate as a reason to pass 
the Communications Decency Act 
of 1994.
There are many lessons that we 
can learn from this episode of CMU 
history, most of them relating to 
the importance of the ill effects of 
fraudulent research that is driven by 
ideological motives. Yet there is an 
important lesson about the freedom 
of speech and the right of students to 
advocate for a change in University 
policy.
In 1994, the Internet played a significandy different role in peoples 
lives. While it might seem incom
prehensible now for CMU to decide 
what students can and cannot view 
on the Internet, it was not so out
landish 10 years ago. Only through 
the efforts of a diligent group of 
students who viewed Internet cen
sorship as a civil liberties issue was 
the decision reversed. Had those stu
dents not protested against the deci
sion and just waited for the issue to 
run its course, its very possible that 
Carnegie Mellon would have contin
ued to censor the Internet.
The lesson to learn here is that no 
policy should be above criticism and 
that history will judge our actions far 
differently than we can ever imag
ine. Perhaps ten years from now, 
students will be appalled to learn 
that Carnegie Mellon once imposedbandwidth restrictions or prevented 
file sharing; or who knows, perhaps 
online gambling will be illegal in a 
decade.
Either way, what matters isnt the 
policies themselves but the ways 
students organize and advocate for 
change. Far more important that 
what students believe is that they 
stand up and fight for their beliefs. 
Whether its in Warner Hall or 
Washington, D.C., there is no reason 
to stand silendy by as administra
tions pursue policies with which you 
disagree.

In the end, everyone was blown

Yasir Arafat are often credited 
with making steps towards the

On September 13, 19931,1 
they signed the Declaration of'1

ered to the circus. Other deaths 
within the last three years have 
involved two Bengal tigers and 
four elephants.
The activists are hopeful that 
their efforts to raise awareness 
will result in better animal care, 
especially for elephants, which 
have the longest lifetime of all 
the other circus animals and 
therefore may be subjected to 
the longest periods of neglect.

projects in various countries that 
are designed to reduce and end 
world hunger. A revolution in 
human dignity, as she called it, 
was behind such efforts as the 
Landless Workers Movement in 
Brazil, where families have been 
relocated to 17 million acres of 
undeveloped land to form their 
own farms and businesses. 
According to Lappe, the city of 
Belo Horizonte, Brazil, is the only 
city in the world to have declared 
that food is a right of citizen
ship.
Lappe also discussed the 
Green Belt Movement in Kenya, 
which has used tree planting 
as an entry point to community 
development, according to its 
website, greenbeltmovement.org. 
Begun by activist and winner 
of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, 
Wangari Maathai, the Green Belt 
Movement originally aimed to 
help rural women by having them
plant trees to anchor their envi
ronment and livelihoods. Today 
it has expanded to other projects, 
and has planted roughly 20 to 30 
million trees.
The third organization that 
Lappe mentioned was the 
Grameen Bank program in 
Bangladesh, where local women 
could participate in the micro
credit system and eventually 
become bank shareholders. 
Lappe described the combina
tion of capitalization and charity 
together as a major accomplish
ment.
After the speech, Lappe pre
sented photographs of the conti
nents she visited during the writ
ing of Hopes Edge. A reception, 
where Lappe signed copies of her 
book and answered questions, 
followed her speech.
Frances Moore Lappe is 
my new hero, said Katherine 
Cummings, a sophomore biology 
major. Her lecture was magnetic 
and extremely thought-provok
ing. She has certainly made an 
impact on the world and, now, 
my life.
I believe that the first anti
dote to fear is trust, said Lappe, 
explaining the motivations 
behind her activism. The second 
antidote to fear is ... what I think 
of as focus or attention.... The 
third antidote is humility.... I do 
believe that I am part of some^ 
thing larger.
Lappe also recalled a discus
sion she had with one of the orga
nizers of the Landless Workers
Movement. Upon asking the 
woman why she had decided to 
take on such a challenge as end
ing hunger in her country, she 
was met with a tearful admit
tance that the woman had known 
it would be difficult to face such 
a problem.
Tearing up, Lappe remembered 
the womans next comment.

not nearly as user-friendly in 
application or setup. The Media

support from such publications 
as PC Magazine, which awarded 
it best of show at Digital Life

to its particularly good hardware, 
especially with regard to the TV

How Things Work: The Ice Cycle
ried by a thin layer of water 
and sediment at the bottom of 
the sheet. Because the pressure 
under the sheet is so great, ice 
can undergo a phase change and 
melt. This forms a thin layer of 
liquid water and sediment that 
facilitates the movement of the 
ice above it in a process called 
basal sliding. With the help of 
this process, ice streams move 
out to sea at up to two miles per 
year. Once the ice reaches the 
edge of the shelf, it can break 
off, or calve, to form icebergs. 
The icebergs float out to sea 
and eventually melt during the 
warm season.
To summarize the ice cycle, 
one can begin with snow accu
mulation. This accumulation 
eventually forms and continues 
to regenerate large continen
tal ice sheets. Several internal 
mechanisms move ice outward 
from the ice sheet, eventually 
calving into the sea from small
er glacial channels or expansive 
ice shelves. Later these icebergs 
melt into the ocean in warmer 
seasons. Ocean water evapo
rates and becomes precipitation, 
repeating the cycle.
For the ice cycle to repeat, 
accumulation must be greater 
than or equal to ablation. Recent 
concerns over the effects of glob
al warming on this cycle have 
raised fears of entire ice sheets 
melting, raising the ocean levels 
by considerable amounts and 
flooding many of the population 
centers of the world. At present 
there is no conclusive confirma
tion for this theory, so dont go 
running for the highlands quite 
yet. But the next time you toss a 
few ice cubes into your drink, be 
thankful you arent under 200 
feet of water.
process called internal deforma
tion, in which gravity exerts a 
settling force. Imagine leaving 
a ball of uncooked dough on a 
table top. If left long enough, 
it would settle into a pancake 
shape. The same occurs in ice 
sheets, and over the course of a 
year an ice sheet might expand 
10 feet outward .
Conversely, marine-based 
ice sheets spill out into the 
ocean over large areas. The 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet is an 
example of a marine-based ice 
cycle. These systems are con
siderably more dynamic than 
land-based cycles. When the ice 
sheet reaches the coastline, it 
spreads out over the water and
ical composition of such trapped 
air bubbles to measure climate 
changes over the existence of 
the ice sheet.
With three million years to 
accumulate, todays ice sheets 
have grown to incredible thick
nesses  up to 4.5 km thick 
in some places. That is the 
equivalent of a building 28 
times as high as the Cathedral 
of Learning! The weight of all 
this ice is so immense that it 
compresses the underlying landmass, so that the ice sheets exist 
in bowl-like depressions.
Depending on the surround
ing geography, ice sheets can 
form ice cycles of two types: 
land-based or marine-based.
little of the suns energy is being 
absorbed, the melting process is 
slowed.
Along with an average tem
perature below freezing, these 
conditions allow for a sustain
able ice cycle to develop. Ice 
cycles can exist on two mac
roscopic scales: mountain gla
ciation and, on a larger scale, 
ice sheets. The dynamics of ice 
sheets are especially interesting, 
and will be the topic of further 
discussion.
Ice sheets didnt just pop into 
existence overnight, rather they 
have been formed over millions 
of years. Today three ice sheets 
exist: one in Greenland and 
two in Antarctica. About three 
million years ago, our planet 
entered a period of cyclical 
cooling which continues today. 
What most people refer to as the 
last Ice Age occurred 20,000 
years ago when the last cycle 
completed. The accompanying 
climate changes of this long
term cooling allowed for the for
mation of the stable ice sheets 
we currently see.'
For their gargantuan size, ice 
sheets have relatively benign 
beginnings; all it takes to cre
ate a sheet is snowfall. If winter 
snowfall survives from season 
to season, the snowflakes begin 
to compact. As successive snow
falls leave their remains atop the 
pack, deeper layers form coarse 
grains of ice. If enough snow
fall accumulates, the pressure 
will cause these grains of ice 
to expand, filling tiny pockets 
of air and growing as large as 
footballs. True glacial ice con
tains less than two percent air 
in the form of tiny bubbles and 
takes about 1000 years to form.

place where permanent snow

obvious cryospheres exist in the 
extreme northern and southern 
latitudes. Permanent snow and 
ice cover exist near the poles 
for two main reasons: One, the 
intensity of solar energy, or 
solar flux, decreases near the 
poles. At the equator, energy 
from the sun strikes perpendicu
lar to the surface of the Earth. 
This maximizes the suns energy 
over a given area. At the poles, 
solar rays travel almost parallel 
to the earths surface, and this 
minimizes the energy striking 
the surface. The existence of a 
cryosphere is also maintained 
by the fact that existing snow 
cover reflects much of the solar 
radiation back into space. Since

Patients will inevitably undergo

moral questions that developed 
as a result of the surgery and see
ing a new visage in the mirror.
Opponents of the surgery wor
ry that the transplants will result 
in the recipient looking similar 
to the donor. This can be hard 
to predict, according to Dr. Vic
tor Weedn, a visiting professor 
of forensic science at Duquesne 
University. It really does depend 
upon how much of the face they 
do transplant, Weedn said. Pos
sible variations of the procedure 
include leaving the patients fa
cial muscles, nerves, or soft tis
sues intact. You may be able to 
retain the recipients nose or eye
brows. That will have a marked 
effect on the extent that the re
cipient will look like the donor, 
said Weedn.
Public acceptance of the proce
dure will likely come down to the 
ethical considerations, according 
to Meisel. He said, This will be 
significantly different, because

need to be employed to connect

teries in the face.
One of the inevitable chal
lenges faced is the possibility of 
rejection. The current method of 
countering transplant rejection is 
treating the patient with immu
nosuppressants that defeat the 
bodys natural ability to fight off 
intruding foreign cells. Although 
the pharmaceutical community 
has recently been making prog
ress in drugs that have fewer
side effects, there are many con
sequences associated with us
ing anti-rejection medication, 
including an increased suscepti
bility to communicable diseases 
and higher chances of malignant 
cancer or diabetes. Many patients 
can become apathetic about their 
regimen of immunosuppression 
agents and stop taking them, 
leading to necrosis of cells in the 
transplant region. In the case of 
Clint Hallam, the worlds first 
hand transplant recipient, doc
tors blamed the eventual ampu
tation of the limb on his refusal to 
continue taking his medication. 
Hallam denied the allegations, 
suggesting instead that he was 
disgusted by the appearance of 
the hand and never felt as though 
it was his.
Patients interested in the pro
cedure will have to sign a consent 
form acknowledging the possible 
risks and undergo rigorous psy
chological examinations before 
becoming a candidate. Numer
ous psychological consequences 
can affect a transplant recipient 
as the result of being placed in 
an unprecedented situation. To 
know that what you have within 
you  and that whats keeping 
you alive  is a part of somebody 
who is no longer living can be 
somewhat disturbing, said Alan

In the mid-1500s, Gaspare 
Tagliacozzi, an Italian professor 
of surgery, adapted Sushrutas 
methods in his own interpreta
tion of rhinoplasty, or plastic sur
gery of the nose. He would cut 
a flap of skin on the upper arm 
loose and attach it to the open 
wound on the patients face. 
When the new skin grew to cover 
the wound, he would cut it free 
from the arm and tailor it to the 
nose. Although Tagliacozzi suf
fered harsh criticism from his 
contemporaries and represen
tatives of the church for his un
orthodox methods, his research 
paved the way for study of trans
plant rejections.
Moving tissue from one por
tion of a patients body to an
other, called an autograft pro
cedure, has been popular since 
the 1800s. Autografts are now 
commonly used to reconstruct 
that which a patient has lost to a 
traumatic injury or severe burns. 
Due to a lack of suitably large 
donation sites on the body, it can 
take many surgeries to complete 
this process. When used on the

sometimes limit expressions or

Delta Tau Delta damages both house and reputation
Bradford L. Yankiver/Forum Editor.

In life, there are gracious losers and 
sore losers. John Kerry was a gracious 
loser; Delta Tau Delta was not. Having 
had their fraternity charter revoked by 
the central office of the Delta Tau Delta 
fraternity, the CMU chapter took out 
their anger on the Carnegie Mellon com
munity in a truly shameful manner.
After losing their charter on Sunday, 
October 31, DTD quickly altered their 
website. What was previously a source 
of information about the chapter became 
explicitly pornographic. Visitors to the 
site Sunday evening were greeted by 
a number of lewd and explicit porno
graphic images, including midget porn. 
The website made an attempt at humor 
by exaggerating the extent of the punish
ment, showing a picture of an individual 
being arrested and claiming that the 
chapter house was boarded up and that 
the walls were about to come down.
While the brothers of DTD were being 
facetious about the windows being 
boarded up, they took it upon themselves 
to take down the walls. Brothers began 
to demolish their own house, report
edly using hammers, among other instru
ments, to inflict significant damage. The 
campus police were dispatched to stop 
the destruction.
These actions are truly upsetting, but 
what makes the matter even more shock
ing is that there had not been any action 
taken against DTD by Carnegie Mellon. 
The central DTD office was solely respon
sible for making the decision to revoke the 
CMU chapters charter. Nonetheless, the 
fraternity members damaged Carnegie 
Mellon property. While CMU had not 
officially punished the members of DTD, 
they would be naive not to expect reperMost students agree that it is wellplanned, dynamic, and demanding 
courses that make for an enjoyable 
semester. Therefore, it should be the goal 
of any university to ensure that the stu
dents receive well-planned courses with 
high-caliber teaching. The policies and 
practices of Carnegie Mellon University 
are merely reactive and fail to acknowl
edge that students are integral to devel
oping good courses and promoting effec
tive teaching; courses are insufficiently 
robust to achieve the goal.
In the Faculty Handbook, eleven 
Guidelines for Excellence in Teaching 
offer suggestions to instructors, includ
ing: define the objectives of a course, 
plan meaningful activities, and provide 
out-of-class time to meet with students. 
The tenth guideline recommends the 
administration of course evaluations with 
public results. This has been formalized 
in Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs), 
which have recently been converted to an 
entirely online format with as many as 55 
questions. Some professors are worried 
that participation will plummet, reduc
ing feedback.
More importantly, the FCEs are a pas
sive instrument, regardless of format. By 
the time they have an effect, the course is 
over and the students experiences are set 
in stone. There must be a mechanism by 
which students can be active participants 
in the evolution of their classes, during 
the semester.
One important step would be to require 
all instructors to administer in-class 
course evaluations after one-third of the 
semester has elapsed. Students would 
be familiar enough with their courses to 
make suggestions as to how the courses 
and professors could better serve them. 
By employing this tool earlier than mid
semester, professors could work sooner

* indicates acting position
cussions for such destructive actions.
This is not to say that the frater
nity acted unilaterally or homogenously; 
there were surely individuals who had 
little or no part in these actions. Still, 
the environment at DTD was such that 
nobody seemed to object to the destruc
tion. It is extremely unlikely that any 
other group on campus that would allow 
such harmful actions to occur unabated; 
these cannot be dismissed as crimes of 
passion.
DTD clearly feels that they were 
wronged by their central office, but that 
is not a valid excuse. The central office 
had declared that DTD demonstrated its 
inability to effectively manage operations 
and abide by Fraternity policies, prac
tices and expectations. By acting out 
in a manner that violated any notion of 
responsibility or respect, DTD confirmed 
its central offices condemnation.
While The Tartan was critical of Kappa 
Sigma in the past, we can look to them 
as a model of dignity compared to DTD. 
Kappa Sigma did not damage their 
house, did not voice their frustration 
with the school or their central office in 
public forums, and is working their hard
est to reintegrate into the community, 
participating in such events as Dance 
Marathon.
There is no place at Carnegie Mellon 
for a group that thinks that midget porn 
and property destruction is the correct 
response to a punishment. DTD has 
been a part of this campus for over eighty 
years, and it would be extremely unfor
tunate if this is how they choose to end a 
legacy. We implore the brothers of DTD 
to move beyond this incident and begin 
the process of reconciliation.
to adjust the class in order to meet the 
needs of their students.
Another progressive move would be 
to apply greater pressure on all depart
ments to maintain potential Student 
Advisory Councils, which have proven 
themselves effective in gathering feed
back. Presently, some SACs are vibrant, 
productive bodies, while others remain 
relatively dormant. Every department 
should be responsible for ensuring that 
SACs are healthy and active.
The University should support the 
creation of a Student Advisory Council 
with the specific function of helping the 
University foster a culture of student 
involvement in the improvement of the 
academic experience. This body could 
monitor the status of departmental SACs 
and could act as a support structure 
for students who want help approach
ing a problem with one or more of their 
courses. This council could help students 
develop concrete ideas and suggestions 
with which to approach a professor. If a 
student is uncomfortable approaching a 
professor, a member of the council could 
approach the professor on behalf of the 
student. The council might work in con
cert with the Eberly Center for Teaching 
Excellence  a wonderful resource for 
professors. Overall, this offers a more 
personal and readily available resource 
for students than approaching the dean 
of a college who is, most likely, already 
pressed for time.
Students at CMU are among the most 
capable and motivated in the country. 
Their performance and scholastic growth 
is, very often, proportional to the extent 
to which their professors engage them. 
It is too often that we are not challenged 
nor given the opportunity and support 
we desire. It is too often that we endure a 
class, rather than engage with it.

A reason to be proud
Weve all heard it at least once in 
the last few days: Thats it, Im mov
ing to Canada. While the line comes 
mostly in jest, underneath it there lies 
a great deal of hurt, disappointment, 
and fear about the coming four years. 
Judging by the signs and pins around 
campus alone, one may surmise that 
this Presidential election did not come 
out the way most CMU students would 
have preferred. Having spent half my 
time since coming to CMU working for 
Kerry, I know the disappointment that 
many students here must feel. However, 
after the experience of this election 
day, I know that we  as volunteers, as 
young voters, and as Americans  have 
good reason to be joyful and proud of 
what occurred here and, more broadly, 
in Pittsburgh this November 2. While 
the election may be over now, student 
political involvement at CMU can con
tinue with the momentum we saw dur
ing the election, if only we will continue 
to be engaged and fight for our values 
at every turn.
From the moment I arrived on campus 
at 7:45 am to the moment my car pulled 
back into the UC turnaround from tak
ing that last student to the polls, this 
campus was alive and energized like

On Tuesday, in the shadow of the 
Presidential election, 11 states passed 
bans on gay marriage. Following in the 
footsteps of Missouri and Louisiana, 
these states violated basic civil rights 
and cast discrimination into law.
This new wave of state-sanctioned 
homophobia has a strong connection to 
our countrys history of institutionalized 
racism. Many of the arguments thrown 
around condemning same-sex marriage 
had their initial run with the movement
When the Tartan commissions report 
came out on August 31, the adminis
tration was braced for a tremendous 
reaction from the campus, as well as 
from the Pittsburgh community. That 
Tuesday came and went without a sound 
from any of the previously concerned 
individuals. This lack of reaction drew 
a sigh of relief from many within the 
organization and the administration. 
This lack of reaction allowed the Tartan 
to continue to operate and produce a 
paper, but there was still the question of 
what would be the most effective way to 
use the report.
However, after time was taken to find 
set a routine for the papers production, 
we decided that we needed to take full 
advantage of the advice put forth in 
the document. It is rare that any uni
versity would ever put so much time 
and intellectual capital into examin
ing and dissecting what is essentially a 
student organization. Furthermore, to 
hand it such a detailed document on 
ways to improve its procedures is truly 
a remarkable gift from any university 
to one of its organizations. With that in 
mind and the production of the paper 
in a stable period, we have set a weekly 
meeting to discuss the internal changes 
that will occur at The Tartan. The issues 
discussed are those that are included in 
Charge 2, regarding such areas as staff
ing, training and advising, operations, 
and relationships.
ing station after 3 pm knows the level of 
enthusiasm and dedication that student 
voters from our school exhibited. Pride 
is an understatement for the feeling 
I had while watching people younger 
than myself wait three to four hours so 
that their voices could be heard.
And make no mistake; our voices 
were heard.
Data shows that a mere 238 votes 
were cast at Schenley in the 2000 elec
tion. This year, we filled buses, cars, and 
vans for 12 hours and easily tripled that 
number  MSNBC actually mentioned 
CMU for our efforts. According to data 
from the University of Pittsburghs main 
polling station, voter turnout there 
increased from 947 voters in 2000 to 
more than 1500 this year. The work 
that was done in this part of the state by 
groups like Everybody Vote, MoveOn. org, 
the College Democrats, and many oth
ers was surely a factor in Pennsylvania. 
Voter turnout was increased by over 
750,000 voters compared to the 2000 
election, which had one of the highest 
turnouts in years. These numbers, as 
well as the raw excitement that we saw 
around campus last Tuesday, should 
make our university community, our 
city, and our state proud. We young 
voters of Pittsburgh contributed to an 
amazing 64 percent turnout rate in the 
10 most crucial battleground states.
Yet when all was said and done,
to ban interracial marriage. How can we 
as a country condemn racism, and then 
turn around and use the same historical 
arguments against race to take away the 
rights of gay citizens?
Same-sex couples have the funda
mental right to get married and to enjoy 
all of the same rights afforded to hetero
sexual couples.
In response to the recent bans on gay 
marriage, Julia Carroll, a senior civil 
and environmental engineering stu
dent, as well as a co-president of ALLIES 
(CMUs GLBT/straight alliance), told 
me, I almost cried when I found out, 
especially when I realized that eight of 
the 11 states also outlawed civil unions, 
domestic partnerships, common law
The Tartan is beginning to move in 
the right direction in terms of an answer 
to the reports suggestions, but there 
is an issue in the Commission report 
that deserves further scrutiny from the 
community. As we passed midsemester 
break, the Tartan came out with its sixth 
issue since the Natrat of last year. It has 
been approximately eight months since 
the initial forum held on the issue, yet, 
we have to ask ourselves, what changes 
have really occurred within the commu
nity? Charge 3 is the largest section of 
the commissions report, and it pertains 
specifically to recommendations for the 
broader community.
These recommendations outline 
issues such as the lack of education and 
exposure to the diversity of our campus, 
as well as to broader issues involving 
the need to maintain the values of civil
ity and respect in interpersonal relation
ships on our campus. This latter point 
seems particularly important because of 
the nature of our campus.
We pride ourselves on being an insti
tution full of task-oriented and hard
working people. But when absorbed 
in that work, we often find ourselves 
neglecting those values of mutual 
respect. Some observers mistake this 
neglect for an underlying apathy in our 
students. But this issue is constantly 
brought up: for instance, in the free 
speech forums held last spring. We saw 
a lot of discussion about how freedom of 
speech is a necessity, but what is more 
important is the need for understanding
for the second consecutive time our 
school and our state did not correctly 
predict the winner of the Presidential 
election. November 2 was a dark day 
for Democrats across the country on 
nearly all fronts. It is my hope that 
these losses  along with the gain 
of some new blood in the Senate ill 
Ken Salazar and Barack Obama  will 
shake up and breathe new life into the 
flailing Democratic Party. However, our 
next chance to enact change on such a 
grand scale is at least another two years 
away, when the staunchly conservative 
Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) comes 
up for re-election.
In the meantime, our energy must:r 
not be allowed to deflate and diminish.11 
We must not regress to the apathy older 
generations have alleged of us. Whether 
or not this election had an overall effect 
on the youth population of the coun
try might be debatable, its effect on 
the college-age voting population of 
Pittsburgh is indisputable. Students at 
CMU, the University of Pittsburgh, and 
the other colleges were more excited,,j 
more informed, and more involved 
with politics than at any other time in 
recent history. While we await our next 
big chance for personnel change at the 
national level, there remains plenty of 
work to be done locally.

marriages, etc. It scared me to find 
out how much of this country is. so 
bigoted.
Having grown up half the time 
in Missouri and the other half in 
Massachusetts, two opposite poles on 
the gay marriage issue, I have family 
members on both sides of the debate.
When I first heard the news that 
Massachusetts had legalized gay mar-, 
riage I started crying and laughing 
because I was so happy and proud. 
When I heard the news that Missouri,r-*  33)my other half, had voted 71 percent in 
favor of a ban on gay marriage, I couldnt 
say a word. My mother called and apot^

and respect for the differences that exist 
on a campus that is continually focusing 
on its diversity. What comes out of this 
is another point of Charge 3: the need 
to educate and communicate between1 
different organizations.
The real question is why the Natrat 
concern, which last spring represent
ed an issue that mobilized a part of 
the community to levels rarely seen on 
this campus, is no longer an issue. To 
extend that question back to the time 
of publication, why was it that only a 
certain segment of the community felt 
outraged enough to take action while 
others remained silent?
What we can do is to charge oE' 
selves to be educated and communicate 
even when issues appear to be past their 
prime importance among the commu
nity. The Tartan would like to start by 
hearing your opinions, so that we can 
do our part not only to help improve 
The Tartan, but also to provide a plat
form to discuss the issues put forth in 
the commissions report regarding the 
charge to the community. This forum 
will be held on Wednesday, November 
10 at 4:30 in Rangos 3.
It is important that the Tartan creates 
an opportunity to hear feedback on how 
it can improve the service it provides for 
the campus and even more important 
that the community voice an opinion.

Gay marriage laws violate civil rights
A Response From The Tartan

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 8, 2004A?
Food and music fail to encompass cultures complexities
Alisha Bhagat
For the most part, people enjoy learning 
about other cultures. Unfortunately, they 
usuallyjdo so in a very limiting manner. 
Take Epcot Center, for example: People 
can travel around the world in a day as 
they visit different cultural pavilions. This 
can be seen as in a positive light since, in 
the past, many people may have been fear
ful of rather than inquisitive toward other 
cultures. The problem begins when, as at 
Epcot, other cultures are treated as com
modities, rather than as subjects worthy of 
complex analysis.
The rise in popularity of package tours 
and sightseeing checklists are one mani
festation of this ethos. Culture is turned 
into something that can be experienced 
in short bursts and then checked off on a 
list. Just as a visitor to America would get a 
very narrow perspective on American cul
ture by just visiting the Statue of Liberty 
and eating a hot dog, so do participants 
in cultural fair-style events usually come 
back with limited experiences that they 
use to represent a culture. Students usu
ally come away having learned about the 
pleasantries of another culture: how beau
tiful Chinese calligraphy is or how tasty 
Belgian chocolate is. What is missing is 
a deeper understanding of the culture in 
question.
The fact remains that you cannot learn 
much about a culture simply by eating 
their food and listening to their music. 
While cultural fair-style events are fun,
they do not promote a deeper level of cul
tural understanding. What a culture truly 
holds dear  its values and beliefs  are 
not conveyed. How many times have you 
attended a cultural fair and learned about 
issues such as womens rights, genocide, 
or the effects of globalization? Diversity 
events usually end up playing like National 
Geographic specials: all style and very little 
substance.
In light of the frivolous nature of cultur
al fairs, this years International Festival is 
truly remarkable. The organizers are faced 
with the difficult task of imparting cul
tural knowledge, while ensuring that the 
event is entertaining. The events this year 
were refreshing in that instead of aiming 
for something big, they focused on smaller 
issues, such as banana production in Latin 
America, allowing people a more nuanced 
understanding of the issues important to 
particular cultures.
While the festival was a success in many 
ways, the format of large-scale cultur
al festivals poses problems. How do you 
choose what to present? Groups often end 
up falling through the cracks.
For this years festival, MSA, the Muslim 
Student Association, was contacted in 
order to contribute Muslim food. Muslims 
live in many countries around the world; 
there is no unified cuisine. Additionally, 
the festival fell during the holy month 
of Ramadan, when Muslims fast during 
the day. Serving food while fasting did 
not seem like a pleasant prospect. After 
some deliberation, the MSA determined 
that what they really wanted to share

This gay peacenick feels isolation, but also renewed passion
Adam Atkinson
Surely after such a disastrous 
Presidency, marked by an unpop
ular war, a sluggish economy, 
and intense disregard for every 
minority imaginable, we could 
win. Surely after we won all three 
debates; we could win. Surely, 
after the young people of America 
suddenly became engaged in the 
national dialogue, we could win. 
But we didnt.
Now, there are some impor
tant questions to tackle. What are 
our values? Why are those values 
so unappealing to the majority 
of Americans? And most impor
tantly, ihow have we lost  twice
 to a man we perceive to be the 
most unqualified, dimwitted, and 
hypocritical man ever to be called 
President? The pundits agree: 
The Democratic party is headed 
for a serious identity crisis.
As a result, I am having a simi
lar crisis of identity. For the past 
four years, I listened to all the 
hype. I thought of myself as a 
crusader of the people, a man 
whod help make the peoples 
will known,, this time. The peo
ples will was made known. But 
it scares me like I never thought 
it could.
So what am I? A crusader of 
some people? Or just an expatri
ate in my own country?
My intention is not to sound 
melodramatic. My feelings are 
not based solely on disagree
ment with Bushs policy. They
are based on Bushs entire con
cept of America, endorsed on 
Novermber 2 by the majority of 
voters. This is makes me seriously 
re-evaluate my place in such an 
America.
First, as a gay American, I 
am simply too disheartened 
for words. The President has 
endorsed a constitutional amend
ment with the potential to ban 
not only marriage but also civil 
unions and partner benefits. Exit 
polls show such moral values 
motivated people to vote Bush 
more than anything else. Eleven 
states passed bans of their own, 
including liberal Oregon, where 
thousands of marriages will now 
be nullified.
Second, as a peace-loving 
American, my life wont get much 
rosier. I knew Kerrys plan for
Iraq was not much different from 
the Presidents, so what was I 
hoping for? That Kerry might be 
able to execute that plan with 
results other than fiasco. That 
we might get out of there soon. 
That Iraq might not continue its 
descent into terrorist control. 
That my president might be hon
est with me about how bad it was 
getting.
It was my hope that our rela
tions with Saudi Arabia might 
seem less corrupt, that our atti
tude toward Sudan might have 
some substance, that this nation 
might once again see the respect 
of the world as essential to our 
greatness.
I had a lot of hopes.
Ideologically, it was hard not 
to feel an abyss open up between 
my feet and the rest of this nation
when I saw these things happen
ing. So as an American voter, I 
was challenged to see the major
ity of Americans so firm in their 
belief that my dreams of a hus
band, kids, and picket fence must 
 in the least  be put on seri
ous hold. And I was challenged 
to see the majority of Americans 
think that the President was right 
to risk the lives of my peers for 
reasons that Colin Powell himself 
admitted were misleading.
But most challenging is realiz
ing that the majority of Americans 
think that gay marriage and ter
rorism are the two biggest issues 
confronting the people of this 
nation.
These two issues provoke the 
most emotion in me as well, but

A different kind of garden for CMU
Over the past three years, I spent a great deal of time 
on the GMU campus studying how students use the public 
and common spaces. What became apparent to me was 
that itXvas unnecessary to duplicate any existing outdoor 
areas. After talking to many people on campus, I began 
to visualize a unique kind of garden. The original inspira
tion came from the Greek agora, an open marketplace 
where teachers of different philosophies held classes side 
by side, and where students could listen to their teachers 
debate, all while walking along. I imagined a place where 
walking, and getting lost in conversation could become 
an activ rather than a passive pleasure; a place to meet 
friends and colleagues, or encounter strangers from other 
disciplines  a literal marketplace of ideas.
As the project developed, I realized the site needed a 
centerj Vheart to circulate around (and a place to sit down 
and have lunch). The word campo comes from the Latin 
campus 1 an open field. The most famous campo is in 
the Italian city of Sienna, which, with its streets radiating 
out from the center like the arms of a starfish, suggested a 
model for the garden. If Italian architecture seems foreign 
to Pittsburgh, remember that the two greatest buildings in 
Pittsburgh are H.H. Richardsons County Courthouse, an 
homage to medieval European architecture, and Henry
Hornbostels masterpiece, the College of Fine Arts, which 
references an encyclopedic range of the great monuments 
of the world, among them the cathedrals of central Italy.
Both Michael Van Valkenburgh, with whom I col
laborated on the design of the garden, and I felt that the 
campus needed a space of fantasy and imagination, where 
one could escape from the daily pressures of academic 
life, somewhere not on the way to somewhere else. That 
is what we tried to build  a place set apart, a world in 
itself. It has been suggested that the garden is out of 
context with the run of campus architecture, and that 
the colors clash with the neutral tones of adjacent build
ings. But that design philosophy, with its subtext of never 
call attention to yourself, has only littered the landscape 
with bland, unimaginative buildings.
In order to give the garden the feeling of being a world, 
it needed a central generating form. From the beginning 
I was certain that it had to be an organic form. How 
better to generate a-set of curves than from the French 
curve? And what a happy coincidence that it resembled 
another historical signifier  the artists palette. That 
engineers and artists no longer use these tools does not 
alter the tools ability to symbolize two entire cultures 
at a glance. Covering the French curve with numbers 
arranged in a random pattern (with the additional twist 
of a four-directional axial rotation) was inspired by the 
great black and white Roman mosaic floors at Pompeii 
and Herculaneum.
Our concept behind the paths was to choreograph the 
experience of a long walk in a small space. The meander
ing paths, rising and falling as they curve between the 
undulating mounds, heighten ones awareness of ones 
constantly changing orientation to the site, all while giv
ing the surreal sensation of stepping into orangeness. The 
planting material was selected to have color that changes 
in spectacular and surprising patterns as the seasons 
progress.
Inscribed in tile on the back wall is a quotation from the 
philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. It has been transcribed 
word-for-word in reverse order, an old and simple form of 
encryption. The idea was to provide a text, like a caption, 
to accompany the garden, but one that critiques the very 
idea of those elevated sentiments engraved on institu
tional facades around the world. The quotation, when 
deciphered, reveals itself as a metaphor for the garden as 
a labyrinth.
We hope our design offers all the desirable pleasures 
of a garden, including intellectual stimulation. But even 
beyond that, I hope that it offers students an ideal to 
strive for  think for yourself, use your imagination, 
dont worry about blending in, and keep in mind that 
sometimes you have to walk around in circles, or look at 
the world backwards, to see it as it really is.

Pittsburgh students set 
national voting standard
TURNOUT, from A7
Simply put, local and grass
roots politics can have much 
more impact on everyday life than 
Presidential races can. Perhaps if 
a few hundred more students had 
voted in our last mayoral or city 
council election, the bus service 
cutbacks were currently seeing 
on nights and weekends wouldnt 
be happening. We have the power 
to affect these choices and to elect 
representatives that will listen to 
our concerns. Simple actions can 
have huge consequences. Go start 
a petition. Join a student group. 
Call your legislators and give them 
a piece of your mind. However 
you choose, CMU, get out and do 
something! Democracy requires 
not just votes in elections, but an 
engaged citizenship that holds its 
leaders accountable every step of 
the way. We as the youth of the
nation have the most to lose by 
inactivity and the most to gain by 
political action.
This election season has prov
en our school and our commu
nity to be a model of what stu
dent political participation can 
be. While we should be proud 
of this fact and all of the tireless 
work that so many of us did for 
this election, theres a long and 
tortuous road ahead. Our lives 
and our future are being gambled 
with every decision at City Hall 
and in Washington. Keep your 
chin up, students: In the end, the 
fear, deception, and division that 
has characterized our country for 
the past few years will give way 
to hope, truth, and love. In the 
words of Dan Bern  one my 
favorite musicians  theres still 
time to take back the new millen
nium. Its just going to take some 
work.
Despite setback, liberals 
should hold on to hope
PEACENIK, from A7
I am aware that health care is 
a bigger deal for America as a 
whole. I am aware that education 
is. I am aware that civil liberties 
are. Most Americans do not share 
that awareness, and that is why 
part of me is wondering what; 
happened to Americas ability to 
imagine itself in someone elses 
shoes.
But all is not lost. Just look 
at Massachusetts, where every 
single politician who supports 
gay marriage was re-elected, and 
three who oppose it were voted 
out of office. In Illinois, the bright
est new star in the Democratic 
Party won when he did exactly 
what they say Democrats cant do 
anymore: connect with peoples 
values. Senator Arlen Specter did 
my vote proud this past week by 
warning President Bush about 
Roe v. Wade and the Supreme 
Court.
Regardless, I am still American
 just as American as anyone 
else. When I arrived at first-year
orientation, I was a closeted 
kid whod never voted. When I 
graduate, Ill be an openly gay 
man whos in a fraternity and has 
dreams of public service. In these 
four years, things have certainly 
changed.
Things will continue to change. 
Im just as driven as ever. Its 
the potential I have to do whats 
impossible now, possible later, 
that keeps me so proud to be 
an American. Sure, Im scared 
of being openly gay without a 
fraternity, and an entire univer
sity community, backing me up. 
But am I about to hide from the 
real world because of people who 
dont even know me? Hell no. 
Bring it on, America. Itll be one 
hell of a battle, but Ive got to be 
on the front lines. Will I see you 
there?

ogized on behalf of our state. 
We were both stunned.
I can imagine, though, people 
in my own extended family who 
probably voted in favor of the 
ban. I have a face for people on 
both sides of the issue. My con
servative grandfather could eas
ily have voted for it, and though
I disagree strongly with many of 
his views, I still love him. I can 
see that he does have good in 
him, underneath all of the ugli
ness he chooses to voice.
These homophobic bans were 
not passed by legions of fanat
ics banging their drums. They 
were passed by a large group 
of regular people who have 
somehow convinced themselves 
that homosexuality is not natu
ral and that same-sex couples 
should be treated as secondclass citizens.
Not long ago in this country, 
many otherwise good people 
similarly let themselves get lost 
in hateful justifications for rac
ism. It wasnt until 1967 that the 
Supreme Court struck down all 
laws banning interracial mar
riage.
On Tuesday night, Jon 
Stewart from the Daily Show 
tried to bring some humor into 
this difficult gay rights issue. 
After counting off all 11 of the 
states newly banning gay mar
riage, he sadly joked that now, 
in Mississippi, you cant even 
look at dudes.
Even while Stewart was try
ing desperately to bring some 
sort of humor into this shock
ing situation, I couldnt help 
but think about how just 50 
years ago, in the South, black 
men couldnt even look at white 
women. If a black man so much 
as looked at a movie poster of a 
white woman, he risked getting 
himself into serious trouble.
Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a 
leader of the black civil rights 
movement, wrote in The Boston 
Globe last year, We cannot 
keep turning our backs on gay 
and lesbian Americans. I have 
fought too hard and too long 
against discrimination based on 
race and color not to stand up 
against discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. Ive heard 
the reasons for opposing civil 
marriage for same-sex couples. 
Cut through the distractions,
and they stink of the same fear, 
hatred, and intolerance I have 
known in racism and in big
otry.
Carroll stated that in the cam
pus office of SoHo (Carnegie 
Mellons Resource Center 
for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, & 
Transgender Concerns), stu
dents have hung up a poster 
with a black and white picture 
of two water fountains right 
next to each other, one labeled 
straight and the other labeled 
gay.
Instead of falling into the trap 
of repeating our past, we need 
to stand up and demand equal 
rights for every citizen in our 
country. We have come too far 
in the civil rights movements to 
fall backward into a homopho
bic funk. Carroll commented, 
I dont understand how people 
dont see the parallels between 
now and forty years ago. This is 
becoming the civil rights move
ment of our generation.

Throughout the season the solid

points and netting a total of 565 
yards.

Womens 
volleyball 
takes fourth
by Erin Goldberger
Assistant Sports Editor
The UAA championships for 
womens volleyball were held 
Friday and Saturday at Emory 
University. Overall, Carnegie 
Mellon took fourth place, 
while Washington University 
took first, Emory University 
placed second, and New York 
University took third. The 
University of Rochester, The 
University of Chicago, Brandeis 
University, and Case Western 
Reserve University also compet
ed in the tournament.
On the first day of the tour
nament the teams were split 
into two pools. Carnegie Mellon 
was placed in Pool B with 
Emory University, University 
of Chicago, and Case Western 
Reserve University. Carnegie 
Mellon first defeated the 
University of Chicago 3-1 with 
match scores of 30-19, 308, 
28-30, and 30-25.
Carnegie Mellon then came 
back to defeat Case Western 
with a score of 3-1 as well, with 
match scores of 30-18, 30-8, 
27-30, and 30-9. However, 
in the Carnegie Mellons last 
match of the day they were 
defeated by Emory University 
3-0 with match scores of 30-17, 
30-23, and 30-23. After day 
one, Carnegie Mellon was in 
second place after Emory.
The second day of the tour
nament wasnt as strong for 
Carnegie Mellon, as they fell 
to Washington 3-1 with match 
scores of 30-20, 27-30, 30-24, 
and 30-23. Later in the day, 
Carnegie Mellon was again 
defeated by NYU 3-0, a surpris
ing loss since Carnegie Mellon 
had defeated NYU earlier in the 
season.
Sophomore Becky Metier 
said of the loss, This was our 
first five-match tournament 
since the beginning of our 
season. We played really hard 
against Washington and one 
match against them which we 
were proud of since they are 
ranked so high. By the time we 
played NYU we were physically 
drained.
Earlier this week, sophomore 
Catie Fisher was honored for her 
performance at the Carnegie 
Mellon Volleyball Tournament 
on October 29 and 30. Fisher 
broke a school record for kill 
percentage in a match (.710) in 
a 3-0 victory over Susquehanna. 
She recorded 23 kills and one 
error on 31 attempts. She also 
helped the Tartans go 4-0 dur
ing the tournament and a first 
place finish in their eight team 
tournament. Fisher hit .350 
with 69 kills in the four matches 
and was named Most Valuable 
Player of the tournament.
The women now await 
announcement of a NCAA 
Tournament bid. Metier said, 
If we had placed third in thetournament we would have a 
place at the NCAA Tournament, 
but now we will have to wait 
and see if we made it.
Womens soccer defeated by Emory Eagles 1-0
Sophomore Andrea Maresca keeps the ball away from her Emory opponent.

The 27th-ranked Carnegie 
Mellon womens soccer team 
ended its regular season Sunday 
with a tough 1-0 loss at home 
to the Emory Eagles. The 
Tartans finish University Athletic 
Association (UAA) play with a 
3-3-1 record (10-3-3 overall). 
Emorys win puts them at the 
top of UAA standings at 6-1, 
and gives the team an automatic 
berth to the NCAA tournament.
Prior to the game, the Tartans 
two seniors were honored 
for their contributions to the 
team over the past four years. 
Goalkeeper Megan Monroe and 
midfielder Amy Tsao were pre
sented with flowers by head 
coach Heather Kendra. Monroe, 
a computer science major, and 
Tsao, an electrical and computer 
engineering major, will graduate 
in May. Monroe was also hon
ored this week by being named to
the Third Academic All-America 
Team.
Carnegie Mellon outplayed 
Emory and dominated posses
sion right from the start as the 
Tartans controlled midfield early 
on. In the ninth minute, junior 
fullback Margaret Beck shook a 
defender along the right side
line and sent an excellent cross 
into the box, but it could not 
find a Tartan head. Two minutes 
later, sophomore fullback Andrea 
Maresca centered the ball to 
junior forward Hallie Dumont, 
who turned and shot the ball past 
Emorys goalkeeper, but it hit the 
far post.
The middle of the first half was 
marked by injuries. In the 20th 
minute, sophomore midfielder 
Lisa Pascoli went down with an 
ankle injury and had to leave the 
game. Shortly thereafter, junior 
forward Kristin Bevilacqua-Linn 
joined her on the sideline with 
an injured knee. Ten minutes 
later, junior midfielder Vanessa 
McClain-Duer hit an excellent
through-ball to junior mid
fielder Nadya Yaghoubi, and 
Yaghoubis shot went just wide. 
Unfortunately, she hurt her ankle 
on the play and became the third 
Tartan starter to leave the game 
due to injury.
With nine minutes left to play 
in the first half, Monroe came up 
big on an Emory fast break, and 
dove to her left to make the save.
In the 44th minute, a direct kick 
from first-year fullback Amanda 
Rose nearly went in as Emorys 
goalkeeper had to hit it over the 
bar. The teams went into halftime tied 0-0.
In the 50th minute, an Emory 
player struck the ball from 40 
yards out and it snuck into the

Four weeks ago, Boston Red 
Sox fans across the nation 
tuned in their televisions for the 
American League Championship 
Series expecting to see nothing 
less than solid baseball. Instead, 
and much to their dismay, they 
were handed three swift defeats; 
disheartening the faithful fans 
who have lived with defeat for 
so long.
The few Bethany College 
supporters who made the trip 
from Bethany, W.Va., to Gesling 
Stadium on Saturday must have 
felt the same way. There is one 
stark contrast however, while the 
Red Sox managed to come back, 
ultimately winning the World 
Series, the Bethany Bisns (0-9) 
never had a chance at victory.
After receiving the open
ing kickoff, the Tartans began 
the game from their own 34- 
yard line. First-year running 
back Colby Whitman began 
the game with a 10-yard toss 
for a first down. The following 
play was a play-action pass, yet 
good pass coverage by the Bison 
defense yielded no open space 
for Tartan receivers. Senior 
quarterback Jarrod Highberger, 
who was given excellent pass 
protection, instead kept the ball

and picked up seven yards. Two 
plays later, in a similar situa
tion, Highberger was able to gain 
23 yards. The following play, a 
run by sophomore running back 
Mike Ginestra, resulted in a 25- 
yard touchdown. A successful 
point after attempt by sopho
more place kicker Nathaniel 
Greenstein made the score 7-0. 
The drive, which netted 66 yards 
and took less then two minutes 
off of the clock, would come to 
epitomize the game.
The Bisons first drive began 
with two rushes netting five 
yards. But on third and five, they 
were penalized with costly falsestarts setting up a passing situ
ation. On the following down, 
Bethany senior quarterback 
Nazih Branna dropped back to 
pass but was pressured in the 
backfeld. He scrambled out of 
the pocket and attempted to 
throw on the run. However, as 
he was not able to set his feet, 
the pass was errant and inter
cepted by sophomore defensive 
back Aaron Lewis. Lewis ended 
the day leading the defense with 
seven tackles and breaking up 
two passes.
One of the salient factors of 
this game was that the Tartans 
were able to profit from their 
opponents turnovers  some

Yesterday, the Carnegie Mellon 
University Tartans battled against 
the Emory University Eagles in a 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) game at Gesling Stadium. 
This major rival and game for 
the Tartans determined not only 
their fate in the conference, but 
the Eagles fate as well.
The Eagles came into Sundays 
game after a 2-0 win against 
New York University a week prior, 
with a UAA record of 3-1-2. In 
addition, the Tartans entered 
the field after a 2-0 win against 
Brandeis University a week prior, 
and with a UAA record of 3-0-3.
Both teams were playing 
extremely aggressive, as seen 
by the numerous and danger
ous fouls called by the referees. 
Knowing that this game deter
mined their future in the confer
ence also added to the excite
ment and vigor in the players 
performances.
Sundays game brought 
numerous passionate fans from 
both teams to circle around the 
stadium to cheer on the players, 
which were probably the most 
spectators that mens soccer had 
seen all year.
In the first half, both teams 
played hard and had many scor
ing opportunities, but both lacked 
in actual scoring, and ended the 
half scoreless. However, there 
were some close goals and some 
rough fouls by each team. In one 
instance, Eagle forward Chad 
Chambers fouled Tartan defend
er Steve Berei, with a two-hand 
push from behind. Later on in 
the half, Berei fouled Eagle for
ward Alex Grigalunas which gave 
Emory a free kick in front of the 
goal. Luckily for the Tartans, the
ball deflected off the post, keep
ing the game tied. With 12 min
utes left in the half, the Tartans 
were awarded a free kick on 
the 20 yard line which resulted 
in another deflection, and this 
time off the cross-bar. Due to the 
controversial call, Eagle coach, 
Mike Rubesch walked onto the 
field complaining, and an Eagle 
defender was given a yellow card 
for unsporting behavior.
The second half kicked off with 
more intense play, with sopho
more forward Andrew Park scor
ing in the first 20 minutes off 
a free kick which was awarded 
to the Tartans after a foul on 
sophomore Will Schlough. Four 
minutes later, it seemed that the 
Tartans had taken control of the 
game, as James Steidel scored 
with a header into the Eagle net.
However, the goal was taken 
back after a late offside call was 
made by the assistant referee. 
Later in the half, Eagle goalkeep
er, Michael Conway, lost con
trol of the ball in mid-air, when 
Steidel headed the ball lose. 
When the ball fell to the ground, 
Jonathan Browne was there and 
found the back of the net, giving 
the Tartans a 2-0 lead.
With nine minute's left in the 
game, Eagle forward Grigalunas 
hitched the ball past Tartan goal
keeper, Dave Thomas, from a free 
kick awarded to the Eagles at 
the 20 yard line. That last goal 
ended the game 2-1, allowing 
the Tartans to become the con
ference champions and destroy
ing any chance for the Eagles to 
have an automatic bid for the 
NCAA tournament.
Assistant Coach Matt Crummy 
said, Were in the NCAA selec
tion process and we have an 
automatic bid. The selection proSee MENS, page A9
First-year fullback Travis

up the middle. On the next play,

plete a long 51-yard touchdown 
pass to sophomore receiver Mark 
Davis while in double coverage. 
The drive, which concluded with 
another successful point after 
attempt by Greenstein, took only 
forty-four seconds off the clock.
With the first quarter still 
young, the Tartans took a comWhat is the difference between 
a perennial national basketball 
power and an unranked Division 
III team? Well, at least for the first 
28 minutes of the exhibition game 
between the Pittsburgh Panthers 
and the Carnegie Mellon Tartans 
Saturday night at the Petersen 
Events Center, absolutely noth
ing.
The Tartans stunned the 
Panthers as well as the nearly 
sold-out crowd by taking the lead 
at halftime before being over
run in the final minutes, 97-70. 
Almost comically undersized, 
CMU nonetheless attacked the 
Pitt men with a barrage of offbalanced runners and short jump 
shots to take an early lead. The 
Panthers, despite the advantage 
of a raucous student section, a 
starting lineup featuring at least 
two potential NBA draft picks, 
and a pre-season national ranking 
of 15th in the country, struggled 
to put away the scrappy Tartans.
Even CMU head coach Tony 
Wingen seemed surprised by his 
teams performance against Pitt. 
He said, For about 30 minutes 
this was way beyond anything we 
couldve hoped to get out of this 
game. However, added Wingen, 
It was certainly a daunting chal
lenge playing one of the best 
teams in the country, but we have 
a veteran team and quite frankly 
theyre not afraid of anything.
The Tartans were led by senior 
point guard Jason Walters, who 
glided into the lane at will against 
the slower Pittsburgh guards to 
finish with 18 points and 6 assists. 
Perhaps more important than his 
offensive contributions, though, 
was his high-pressure defense 
which helped lead to nine Pitt 
turnovers in the first half.
An exhibition game between Carnegie Mellon and Pitt left fans surprised at the strong game the Tartans played against the nationally ranked Pitt team.
The Tartan men played a sig
nificant role in the near upset. 
Forward Nate Maurer matched 
up alternately with 610" Chris 
Taft and 240-pound all-Big-East 
defender Chevon Troutman. 
Maurer helped limit the duo to 
a combined 17 first-half points 
and even added some offensive 
fire of his own, stealing a pass 
at mid-court and finishing with 
a thunderous dunk as the halftime buzzer sounded to give the
Tartans a 45-43 lead.
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon 
attributed the lack of production 
from his front line not only to 
the tenacity of the CMU defense, 
but also to the novelty of com
peting against such undersized 
opponents. He said, The small
er teams, physically they pretty 
much have five guards out there. 
You dont often face that in the 
Big East. Chris [Taft] is used 
to guarding [7'0" Aaron] Gray
every day in practice and now 
hes got to step out to 25 feet. For 
his part, Taft made no excuses, 
saying Im not really sure what 
the slow start was about. They 
surprised us and hit some tough 
shots. They played all right.
The Tartans are coming off of 
their first winning season in eight 
years and all but one starter is 
returning this year. Senior Mike 
Divens, who not only led the team 
in scoring a year ago with 16.6
points per game but was also 
named second team all UAA selec
tion, returns as the focal point 
of the offense. He, along with 
Walters, will command the teams 
up-tempo full court defense that 
relies heavily on creating turn
overs and transition shooting.
Wingen is optimistic about the 
season and calls the team a tightknit group that is capable of 
competing in and winning every 
game.

Whats the Motive?
A Perfect Circles new album relives the past
eMOTNe, A Perfect Circles third album, is cer
tainly a departure for the group. With 12 songs,
10 of which are covers, the group describes its CD 
as an album about peace, love, war, and greed. 
The politically charged album was released on 
November 2, election day, and with the polls now 
closed, the album takes on a slightly more desper
ate air.
Featuring covers of some past great artists as well 
as some more obscure bands, eMOTNe hits many 
notes but doesnt always strike clear. Over 12 
tracks, the artsy offshoot of Tool rages against 
the government and the greater human condi
tion. The album art depicts a city in flames, a de
caying peace logo, and eight WWlI-style propa
ganda posters urging citizens to ignore the war so 
obviously being waged.
The opening track, Annihilation, was originally 
by the hardcore band Crucifix. The version on 
eMOTTVe features Maynard James Keenan whis
pering anti-establishment lyrics over faint guitars 
mingled with haunting piano chords. The songs 
style is very reminiscent of Over, the closing 
track on Mer de Noms, the groups first album. 
The piece sets the tone of the disc extraordinarily 
well, remaining one of the albums high points.
John Lennons Imagine gets the Perfect Circle 
treatment on the second track, and will likely be 
the first sample many listeners hear of eMOTNe
 it was the first single released to radio stations 
and on the Web. While the cover is not exactly 
faithful to Lennons original, Keenan and compa
ny pull off an epic piece filled with strings, piano, 
and subdued backing instruments.
Whats Going On and Peace, Love, and Under
standing, originally by Marvin Gaye and Elvis 
Costello respectively, are similarly paced songs. 
The largest difference between the two is that gui
tarist Billy Howerdel lends his own vocal talents 
to Peace, Love, and Understanding. Keenans 
voice is an important part of A Perfect Circles sig
nature sound, but Howerdel does an impressive 
job emulating it while still offering his own twist.
The fifth track, Passive, is one of the albums two 
original songs, co-written with Nine Inch Nails 
Trent Reznor, and is one of the albums more traditional-style rock songs. Passive, along with 
Freedom of Choice, originally written by the
80s powerhouse Devo, is very reminiscent of the 
bands early work on Mer de Noms.
Tracks six and nine, Gimme Gimme Gimme and 
Lets Have A War, are about as blatantly political 
as this album gets. Gimme, originally by punk 
rockers Black Flag, lets Keenans heavily-modulated growls take the stage backed by powerful 
drums. Lets Have A War was originally written 
by Fear  contemporaries of Black Flag  and 
follows a more traditional musical path with an 
even stronger political message, indicting the 
governments constant warmongering. Keenan 
lends his vocals to this song as well, giving it an 
otherworldly, evil quality.
The albums two gems fall near the end, however. 
Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of 
the War Drums is a heavily remixed version of 
the bands own Pet from their second album, 
The Thirteenth Step. The original song was obvi
ously political, calling out unseen forces shield
ing the listener from the real world, so the band 
took this hook and created a techno-industrial 
odyssey. Many elements of the almost-six-minute 
piece are very obviously inspired by Nine Inch 
Nails; gritty guitar riffs and bare drum routines 
give the piece a very Reznor feel.
Following Counting Bodies is a brilliant cover of 
Led Zeppelins When the Levee Breaks. Keenan 
gives the instruments center stage for this track
 Paz Lenchantins hauntingly beautiful piano 
work sets the piece apart from the rest and Howerdels bass ties the piece into the original song, 
echoing Robert Plant well. The vocals are still ex
tremely well done, and will probably echo in your 
head for hours after you put the disc down.
No matter what your political affiliation, eMOTNe 
is worth a look. It certainly helps if last weeks 
election left you with a bad taste in your mouth or 
an urge to move to Ottawa, but the bands politi
cal agenda is just a means to an end. The album 
is not quite as good as A Perfect Circles previous 
two, but it will hopefully grow on you, as most 
experimental cover albums tend to do.

50 YEARS AGO
November 9,1954
The Tartan printed a letter from the Student Council Elections Chairman imploring 
students to vote in upcoming Council elections. The chairman, Dave Larson, cited sev
eral reasons to vote despite growing student apathy, including some issues important 
to the campus community. Among them were facilities expansion, the campus liquor 
policy, hazing, and others.
25 YEARS AGO 
November 6,1979
University Provost Arnold Weber was named president of the University of Colorado, 
effective January 1980. Weber who had previously been dean of GSIA was behind 
many of the successes of the University, according to University President Richard 
Cyert. Weber was a nationally known economist and served on the boards of several 
national corporations. His new post in Colorado put him at the highest position of that 
four-campus university, which hired Weber with expectations to expand.
10 YEARS AGO 
November 7,1994
The Tartan announced that the University planned to begin censoring online bboards 
the following Thursday, commensurate with a Pennsylvania Law banning display of 
indecent and obscene sexual material online. Computing services announced that they 
would eliminate access to 81 newsgroups, including the entire alt. sex hierarchy. Most 
students and student government members were upset about the Universitys failure 
to protect their First Amendment rights.
5 YEARS AGO 
November 11,1999
Carnegie Mellons Administrative Computing and Information Services (ACIS) 
announced that it felt prepared for the upcoming Y2K issue. It claimed that, col
laborating with other campus entities, they had checked all comers of campus from 
generators to fire alarms to the computing network. They also assured campus that 
redundancy checks had been done in order of importance of the systems. ACIS said 
at the time that all computing facilities would be rechecked and backed up before 
December 15.

After resurrecting the issue with a second grander petition, Student Senate rejected 
inclusion in the United States Student Association again. The debate contained accusa
tions that one Senator altered the agenda to disenfranchise Senators who had to leave 
the meeting for personal reasons. That Senator disputed the argument, claiming that 
the reordering was merely to allow time for expanded debate. Only 23 Senators were 
present for the vote, one more than the first, but the motion was once again quashed by 
a vote of 10-11 with a pair of abstentions.

An oven on the hill
Just another South Asian restaurant in the Burgh.
Tori Noquez/Photo Staff
Indian Oven is located on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill.
Indian Oven in Squirrel Hill is a new Indian restaurant 
in the same vein as India Garden, India Palace, and Taste 
of India. The food is almost exactly the same at these 
other restaurants; it could easily be called the Pittsburgh 
Indian Standard. A couple of minor differences are all 
that separates Indian Oven from every other generic 
Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.
The sign outside the restaurant advertising a vegan menu 
initially piqued my interest, but a careful read of the 
vegan menu revealed that it was nothing to celebrate. 
Instead of a separate menu of vegan versions of popular 
Indian dishes such as a fake chicken tandoori, the menu 
was simply a summary of the dishes on the regular menu 
that happened to be vegan. On one hand, Indian Oven 
does provide convenience to vegan customers, as they can 
be assured that all of the items on the special menu are 
vegan. On the other hand, Indian Oven, unlike other local 
restaurants such as Srees across the street, does not make 
the attempt to create new and unusual vegan and veg
Before appetizers, were served, a small salad plate was 
brought out for each patron. The salad was simple  a 
few romaine strips and tomato slices. A lemon wedge was 
provided for dressing and half of a pappadum  a crispy 
Indian cracker made of chickpea flour  accompanied 
the salad. Along with this mini-appetizer I ordered the 
aloo chaat. Chaat is an Indian snack food that is some 
combination of chickpeas, potatoes, onions, tamarind 
sauce, and crispy crackers. The Indian Oven chaat was 
one of the worst I have ever sampled. Instead of being 
a diverse mix of ingredients, it was simply a mixture of 
chickpeas and potatoes covered in tamarind sauce and 
green chutney. These ingredients usually combine well 
when warm, but the Indian Oven chaat was served ice 
cold. It was so cold that the flavors did not combine 
properly, resulting in something that tasted like tamarind 
flavor poured over a can of chickpeas straight from the 
fridge.
etarian dishes. It is also important to point out that most 
Indian restaurants usually serve many vegan dishes.
The glass storefront was not reflective of the aged appear
ance of Indian Ovens interior. The walls were laden with 
kitschy Indian pictures in bright colors and the dim light
ing added to the dingy feel. The atmosphere was similar 
to other popular Indian restaurants in its futile attempt 
to create a subdued dining room. Loud Indian pop songs 
played in the background, which contrasted with the low 
lights.
In spite of this, Indian Oven is not exacdy like its competi
tors, as there was a significant difference in the quality 
of service. Unlike other popular Indian restaurants, such 
as India Garden on Atwood Street, the waiters at Indian 
Oven were genuinely cordial. The service was a surprising 
change from Indian restaurants of its type. If any criticism 
can be made it is that the waiters were a bit too anxious as 
they ran to refill our glasses after every other sip.
sins and cashews, adding a nice touch to a very simple 
dish. The korma was decent, but nothing that couldnt 
be found elsewhere. The saag was similar: good but not 
great and nothing to write home about.
Keep in mirid that Indian restaurants like Indian Oven 
are not the sum total of Indian cuisine. I have yet to 
meet an Indian family that cooks the dishes featured on 
such menus in their homes. Indian Oven serves standard 
Indian restaurant fare decendy, in Squirrel Hill, and at 
modest prices. But if you are seeking a more authentic 
experience, or simply have higher standards for Indian 
cuisine, it is recommended that you skip over Indian 
Oven for more innovative and genuine fare elsewhere.

Like many other Indian restaurants, Indian Oven 
assumes that the customer should determine how spicy 
your food is instead of the chef. This usually results in 
food being too spicy or bland. Most people are unclear 
as to what this mysterious scale of one to ten corre
sponds to. The entrees on which my party settled were 
the aloo saag, cooked spinach and potatoes; vegetable 
korma, a blend of vegetables cooked in a tomato cream 
sauce; and lamb korma. To accompany all this food we 
ordered a basket of garlic naan. The naan was decent 
but the lamb was found to be too tough for the liking of 
one of my companions. The vegetable korma was com

simmered in a creamy sauce. It came topped with rai

______opinion.________________
The Price is... Fair?
Classic game show would benefit from rule changes
Game shows have been a part of television almost since 
its inception, and its hard to imagine what TV would 
be like without these opportunities for Average Joes to 
make it big in front of a live audience. From the early 
game shows like 21 and Lets Make a Deal to Golden Era 
programs like Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune, to the 
recent Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, the formula has 
been simple: Get hosts with personality, get acceptable 
contestants, let people play along at home, and make 
sure that everyone has a chance to win when they get 
to the final round.
For all of the viewing pleasure game shows have brought 
to us over the years, I think that some of the long-run
ning ones should reconsider some of their basic rules. 
It may seem a little presumptuous of me to suggest sig
nificant changes in the decades-old TV warhorses, but 
if the games can be improved, why not? Unfortunately, 
space constraints are preventing me from addressing 
a few changes that I think should be made to Griffins 
own legendary Jeopardy!, including bringing back 
the five-win limit and allowing contestants to ring in 
as soon as they think they know the question, even 
if Trebek hasnt yet finished the answer. Instead, Im 
focusing on proposing serious changes for the remark
ably unserious daytime classic, The Price Is Right.
/
For those of you spending your lives under a rock or 
using your days more productively, The Price is Right is 
played as follows: People are selected randomly from a 
live studio audience to become contestants, where they 
play games, including the incomparable Plinko and 
the game with the yodeling mountain climber that no 
one ever wins, and answer questions about how much 
consumer goods  sometimes a brand new car  cost, 
after which the successful participants win those goods. 
After 32 years, The Price is Right traditions, such as the 
phrase Come on down!, Bob Barkers skinny micro
phone, and reminders to spay and neuter pets, are firm
ly ingrained with the viewing audience. Im all for fa
miliarity and viewing comfort; nonetheless, I think the 
show would be much better and a whole lot fairer with 
some tweaking of the rules.
At the start of each round, a contestant is plucked out 
of the rabid zoo that is The Price is Rights audience. The 
lucky fan takes a spot on Contestants Row, which con
sists of four players. Bob and the showcase girls show 
them a product, usually $300-1200 in price, and the 
person who makes the best guess wins to advance to 
further rounds of the show. Simple, right? Well, my 
problem is that the best guess is defined by the show 
as the one that is closest to the actual value without go
ing over. Thus, if the item actually costs $599, a player
guessing $600 would lose to a competitor who chooses 
$500, even though the first players answer is 100 times 
closer. This is so ridiculous that I almost cant finish this 
paragraph. Who on Earth decided it was better to guess 
low than high? What message does this send to the 
American consumer? I have no idea. I do know that this 
policy is totally devoid of logic and should be changed. 
Clearly, to make the game fairest, the answer that is 
closest to the actual value should win, high or low.
Even more-disconcerting are the indirect problems that 
this inane rule causes. Since the shows genius produc
ers have decreed that the guesses are made in order of 
seniority, a newly selected player must go first while the 
player who has been on Contestants Row the longest 
gets to see everyone elses selection and then place his 
bet last. Often, if players sitting last believe that every
one else has gone over with their bets, they guess $1 
as a safety (read: loser) bet. This tactic should always 
result in several large off-duty policemen chucking you 
off the stage and potentially into a very cold swimming 
pool. Something needs to toughen you up. An equally 
unfair situation is the gambit where a contestant guess
es $1 above what his or her opponent has just entered, 
effectively giving the opponent no chance to win unless 
they got it exactly right, which is quite a rare feat. Of 
course, the people who guess $2 as a safety bet when 
the person in front of them has entered $ 1 should drop 
dead. These sissy techniques would be completely inef
fective, if it was simply the best answer that earned the 
prize.
With my change in place, a loophole nonetheless re
mains because of the sequential guessing system. As 
a contestant sitting late, you can always screw over 
the person guessing in front of you to some extent, as 
long as you know what they have entered  just pick 
$1 higher or lower and youve cut your odds in half. A 
much more equitable system would be for each con
testant to place independent guesses and reveal them 
all afterwards, like they do for Final Jeopardy. Truly, 
the contestant who makes the wisest guess would win 
then, rather than the one who exploits the shows shaky 
rules the best.
In the interest of balance, I should say that the remain
der of the show is fairly well laid out, even though the 
without going over rule persists into the final round. 
With the changes I am proposing in place, I believe we 
can make a stronger The Price is Right for our children 
to enjoy.

Ghost Busters & Ghostbusters II

Its sequel week here at the movies, with four sequels being shown. Ghost
busters kicks off the week with a strong blast of 80s nostalgia. I remember 
being in preschool and being jealous of that kid who not only had the trap 
and the backpack, but was also in full uniform. I think his name was Peter. 
Anyway, the Ghostbusters trap ghosts, store them somewhere, and gener
ally prevent said ghosts from causing mayhem. Because no one else seems 
to believe in ghosts, they have a vast untapped market when demons, the 
Stay-Puft Marshmallow man, and sorcerers come a-calling. I mean, who ya

I havent seen this movie before writing the review of it, and frankly, Im ok 
with that having read what its about. Punching a pregnant woman in the 
stomach to kill the unborn child, suggestions of incestuous ephebophiliac 
rape of the mentally retarded, and not one, but two head-bashing scenes. 
Yeah, that is what it is about. Throw in some observations on what society 
forces a man to do, and you have a film that gets excellent reviews from the

dLT&sPro Bogao Pms gAn
The first one was a serial killers wet dream. Blood everywhere, swords (and 
not just any swords, but katanas), and guns hidden behind cereal boxes and 
never used in any other fights. Ahem. Excuse me, I get upset sometimes when 
movies decide to have plot holes I could drive a Mack truck through. If a mov
ie lacks a plot other than kill stuff, it should be reasonably faithful to how it

the first movie is brought to light, though it should not be a surprise. And 
 spoiler  she kills Bill.

Now, this was a valiant effort, and in Hollywood, that translates to big money 
at the box office. Still, Spiderman 2 could have been much better if they just 
cleaned up a little more. Peter Parker/Spider-Man fights against Dr. Otto 
Octavius Octopus, who is trying to invent a new energy source thats really 
powerful. Meanwhile, Peters getting all mopey because being Spider-Man 
takes a lot of time that he cant spend hitting on Mary Jane. He gives up being 
Spider-Man, comes back to being Spider-Man, and defeats the bad guy. What 
did you expect?  Its a hero comic.

Now, this movie is special in many ways. First, it is a documentary, not a se
quel to some other movie. I checked; there was no Depeche Mode 1 through 
100. Second, it is a documentary shown by AB that was not made by Michael 
Moore. Third, its French. Ok, I lied. That isnt special, what with SCT earlier 
this week. Depeche Mode is some sort of a band, apparendy. This documen
tary shows the band playing music at the Rose Bowl, and people listening to 
them as they play music.

College Music Awards presents Taking Back Sunday
Fall AB Concert breaks new ground
Did anyone else gasp when the Fall AB Concerts posters 
went up around campus? Taking Back Sunday! How did 
Carnegie Mellon get to book a band that sells out concerts 
wherever they go? Does our campus have that much le
verage? In fact, according to Zilo Networks Inc., founder 
of the College Music Awards (CMA), Taking Back Sunday 
actually found Carnegie Mellon.
The 2004 College Music Awards is a music marketing 
company based in New York. This is our inaugural tour 
this year, explained David Isaacs, CEO of Zilo Networks. 
Our concept  we were looking for cool new campus 
events. We realized that theres this whole other genre, 
the college music genre. There is no award show for just 
college music.
Sponsored largely by the Navy, CMA has a certain target 
audience in mind. The Navy's recruiting theme this year 
is rocket science, so they are looking for certain types of 
students. Our theme is a play on words with that: Rockit science is our theme, said Isaacs. It is no wonder that 
Carnegie Mellon would be on that target list of campuses. 
We wanted a large campus and a science bent, Isaacs 
said.
We went to 10 campuses this spring to see if they had 
what we wanted. Then we went to our sponsor data
base  the Navy was the first to join, then Rolling Stone, 
Mobliss, and others. Once we found our sponsors, we 
chose our bands and coordinated with them, Isaacs ex
plained.
We looked for bands that typify the College Music scene. 
College music changes from year to year. We were look
ing for bands that were blowing up, that would blow up. 
Currently the punk-pop genre is blowing up so we went 
with that. We were looking who were the hottest bands 
out there, anticipating who would be the hottest bands.
We are very focused on college bands and we focus on 
being very interactive for college students. We have bands 
that have a grassroots feeling  thats the way we see it. 
We like college music because it has that grassroots feel
ing. Its music that college kids have only heard of kind 
of like breaking ground... well, not exactly underground, 
but just gotten above ground. College students have 
traded their files, and have been going to [these bands] 
shows for a couple of years now.
Dont be fooled by the pop-punk lineup this coming Fri
day. The CMA features several different categories and 
genres where students can vote for their favorite musi
cians. The different voting categories include Best Band,
Best Male and Female Artists, Best Album, and the HipHop Award. When asked about the absence of hip-hop 
headliners, Isaacs replied, We did not find coordination 
with hip-hop bands this year. For example, [the] Black 
Eyed Peas are in South Africa right now.
The band that was available was Taking Back Sunday, 
which is best known for its emo/altemative rise to star
dom with hits such as Youre So Last Summer (the mu
sic video for which featured Flava Flav lip-syncing to the 
bands fake live concert in front of the Brooklyn Bridge). 
The next anticipated video will be for the song This Pho
tograph is Proof from their newest album, Where You 
Want To Be. This video was shot in Los Angeles last week, 
and is currently being developed and edited.
Matt Rubano, TBSs new bassist, took time this week to 
answer some of Pillboxs questions. When asked which 
coast he likes better, Rubano answered, I love California 
when Im there. I never want to leave, but home is home
[Brooklyn, N.Y.]. I basically like wherever I am. True 
to the album title, Rubano has found that TBS is where 
he wants to be. Last year, TBS was going through some 
changes to its lineup, and even had rumors going around 
about the breakup and impending doom of the band. Af
ter two of the original members decided to leave, things 
looked bleak. However, they quickly found new talent: 
Fred Mascherino, a guitarist and vocalist from another 
popular band, and Rubano, a bassist with a diverse back
ground. TBS continued its tour and started writing a new 
album with the two newest additions to the family. As a 
result, their sophomore album has a different feel and 
sound from their wildly popular first. The second album 
combines the flavors from all the members  new and 
old  and the different spices are really noticeable.
When asked who contributed to their new album, Rubano 
answered, We all did, [with myself] as a bass player, mu
sic arranger, composer. I mean, this album would sound 
different  there are different people and its years later.

Pillbox. 8 November 2004.

---------------------------------------------------

The first album was about two or three years before.
Rubanos background includes the Berklee College of 
Music in Massachusetts, and several bands, including the 
lesser-known Schleigho, a jazz band from Massachu
setts. He also played for Lauryn Hill on her album The 
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. He was a featured musician 
at the Bass Player Live! workshop in New York this Octo
ber.
When asked about his teaching experiences, Rubano said, 
I taught a couple of students and gave them some pri
vate lessons from time to time, but I didnt do it for very 
long. I had a friend in NYU who taught a classroom jazz 
ensemble and he would ask me to cover for him when 
he couldnt do it. So I had tiny stints here and there, but 
nothing significant.
Since Rubano comes didnt start off playing for emo/alternative bands, Pillbox asked him how he liked the genre. 
What I really like about music is that there is so many 
different kinds of music, different instruments, different 
bands, answered Rubano. What interested me in mu
sic is that everything is so differently written, how they 
[genres] differ from each other. I respect people who play 
emo/punk, and I love playing it. I listen to a lot of that. 
Miles Davis played the same exact notes as we are, but in 
a different way. Music is music.
Rubano continues, If someone didnt know about us, 
they would think they are punk, and punk-type people, 
which I am not. I listen to it, and there are some great 
bands out there who play it, and there are some bands 
that are boring.
Some other questions that Pillbox asked Rubano:
Pillbox: Ideally, which band would you tour with if you 
had the choice?
Rubano: Ideally realistically, or ideally in a perfect 
world?
Pillbox: Ideally realistically.
Rubano: Ideally realistically  maybe start touring with 
bands outside of the [emo] scene. Right now were tour
ing with a lot of bands that are punk rock. Id like to tour 
with someone super-huge and way out of our league. 
Maybe open for the Chili Peppers.
Pillbox: I heard that you played in the Bat Boy musical 
somewhere. Did you know CMU just put on that play a
/
few weeks ago?
Rubano: Yeah, I did Bat Boy years ago when I was living 
in New York and playing with a bunch of different people. 
I was in the pit orchestra for that. I agreed to do it because 
I could read music, and it was a paying job. It was fun  I 
had lots of friends in the orchestra pit and in the cast, so 
it was a good time.
Pillbox: How long have you been playing the bass?
Rubano: Ten or 11 years. It was the first instrument that 
I stuck with and got some skill playing. I had the second 
grade violin stint and I tried the guitar once but I didnt 
like it  it had too many strings. I picked up a bass at the 
suggestion of a friend.
Pillbox: Did you do anything fun for Halloween or Mis
chief Night?
Rubano: I thought we were going to, but it was Fall
out Boy and Matchbox Romances last night and in the 
middle of the sets we brought out a bottle of champagne 
to say goodbye and thanks. Our fall tour, starting today 
[November 3], switched from Matchbox Romance and
Fallout Boy to Funeral for a Friend and Atreyu.
Pillbox: Any additional comments?
Rubano: Yeah, Id like to thank the people coming to see 
the band and checking out the music. We owe all of this 
to you out there taking the time to come see us. Thanks 
a lot.
Other bands touring campuses are Yellowcard, which has 
already hit up the University of Illinois-Champaign, Ohio 
State University, and Penn State University; and Some
thing Corporate, which will visit Ferris State University in 
Michigan and SUNY-Oswego. The complete tour sched
ule is found on Zilos website, www.zilo.com/shows/ma.
Taking Back Sunday, along with The Varsity, Funeral for 
a Friend, and Atreyu, will come to CMUs campus on Fri
day. Be sure to catch the College Music Awards booths 
during the day in the Mercer Courtyard to win a meetand-greet with the band before the concert later that eve
ning in Wiegand Gymnasium.

_________movie._____________________________
The Incredibles is one of the best
Pixars new film is worth every penny
Pixar Studios may be the most consistently brilliant film 
studio in existence today. They burst onto the scene in 
1995 with the revolutionary computer-animated classic 
Toy Story and since then, each of the five films theyve 
released has been met with critical praise and enormous 
box-office success. The Incredibles, Pixars latest venture, 
seems poised to continue this tradition.
The Incredibles is about a family of superheroes forced to 
go underground and live a normal suburban life. It turns 
out that the litigation-happy lifestyle of the world today 
extends to superheroes, as well  the reason they cant 
be heroes anymore is because people started suing when 
they were saved.
Ever since Toy Story, Pixar films have been more than just 
cartoons. They appealed to a huge cross-section of audi
ences because they had references and minor plot points 
that went over the heads of young viewers. Pixar movies 
dont treat the audience like children, and that is a large 
part of why The Incredibles succeeds where so many other 
animated features lately have failed.
Brad Bird, who previously directed the sleeper animated 
film The Iron Giant, wrote and directed The Incredibles. 
His work on the film further proves that Pixars sense of 
style balances with substance.
The big news about The Incredibles is that it is Pixars first 
movie starring human characters. In previous films, the 
stories have featured humans in supporting roles (the 
dentist in Finding Nemo, the little girl in Monsters Inc., 
and Sid in Toy Story). Since it is still very hard to render 
convincing people with computer graphics, The Incredi
bles relies on a unique art style to maintain the look and 
feel of the film. Female characters are all lithe and tooth
pick-skinny, while most male characters are broad-shoul
dered and muscular. This is a comic-book-inspired world, 
after all.
The story pulls you in immediately; the film starts with 
an action sequence full of background and introduces 
the main character, Mr. Incredible. After this opening 
gambit, the pace slows and explores the life of the Parr 
family now that they are no longer superheroes. Theres 
Bob (Mr. Incredible), who is incredibly strong. His wife 
Helen (Elastigirl) can stretch into any shape. Even their 
children, Violet and Dashiell, have powers. Violet can 
turn invisible and emit a spherical force field of varying 
size around herself, while Dashiell  whose nickname 
is Dash  has the gift of supernatural speed. Both of 
these children grew up in a world where superpowers 
were something to be ashamed of, and so they try their 
best to conceal their gifts.

Home life is difficult for Bob Parr. He yearns to be out 
on the street saving peoples lives, so at night he and his 
friend Lucius Best (formerly the superhero Frozone) go 
out in ski masks to perform vigilante superheroism. All 
this changes when Bob gets an unexpected message from 
a woman named Mirage  her shadowy employer needs 
Mr. Incredibles help to solve a big problem involving ro 
bots on his private island. From here on out the story 
never stops pushing forward without a lull, barreling 
through action sequences so rapidly that the second hour 
of the film is basically just one giant climactic scene.
The action sequences in The Incredibles are flat-out as
tonishing. They are more insanely kinetic and deliciously 
complex than virtually any scene in an animated movie 
before, and more than most big-budget action blockbust
ers, as well. They are also more violent than anything 
Pixar has done before. This film is the first that Pixar 
has released that has been rated PG, and the tone of the 
movie reflects that. It is a darker movie  gunfights and 
explosions abound  and the film is all the better for it. 
In one scene about halfway through the movie, Helen 
Parr is piloting a jet toward the island when she has to
Pillbox. 8 November 2004.
evade a volley of anti-aircraft missiles. An intense dog
fight ensues, and briefly you forget that youre watching a 
cartoon. This is the true sign that Pixar has created some
thing wholly wonderful.
The Incredibles is still technically a Disney movie, though, 
and it has the memorable characters to fill those shoes. 
Craig T. Nelson is the voice of Mr. Incredible, and he plays 
the role with just the right mixture of desperation and 
fatherly love. Carnegie Mellon alumna Holly Hunter pro
vides the voice for Helen Parr, giving her a stereotypical 
but still fun-to-watch butt-kicking mother role. Jason Lee 
plays the movies villain, Syndrome, with such dastardly, 
hyperactive panache that, by the end, you cant imagine 
the character being voiced by anyone but Lee.
One of the coolest treats throughout the movie, though, 
is Samuel L. Jacksons Frozone character. A fusion be
tween a speed skater and X-Mens Iceman, Frozone is the 
perfect supporting role. Jackson, of course, has one of 
the most distinctive voices in modern film, and it was a 
delight to hear him in The Incredibles. Frozone also has a 
big role in the final action sequence, which makes it even 
more fun to watch as his icy powers enter the fray.
The Incredibles may very well end up being one of Pixars 
best movies. Their 2005 release, Cars, looks too Disneyfied to be as promising as their other films. While Toy Sto
ry and Finding Nemo will surely go down in movie history 
as classics, The Incredibles has that extra edge of which 
Pixar just scratched the surface in Finding Nemo: that 
extra little bit of spunk to keep audiences craving more. 
Each Pixar movie gets better than the last, and hopefully 
the group will keep learning and outperforming them
selves in the future.

Minute Album Reviews
Quick once-overs of new music
Courtesy of Pulse of the Twin Cities
Elliott Smith up close.
Artist: Elliott Smith 
Album: From a Basement on a Hill 
Released: October 19, 2004 
Genre: Rock/Pop
Almost exactly a year after Elliott Smith was reported 
dead to an unprepared fan base, friends and family of 
the musician put the finishing touches on the album he 
was preparing for release. As people continue to argue 
over whether Smith took his own life or was the victim 
of some malicious setup, this album is all I need for a sui
cide note. Of course Elliott Smith would not be himself if 
he were to sing about anything happy, but this album is 
the most suicide-obsessed album Ive heard from him. Its 
angry and harsh, and if it werent for his distinctive voice, 
I wouldnt even recognize half of the songs as his. All in 
all, Elliott Smith is incapable of making a bad album, 
even if he doesnt finish it himself. Still, From a Basement 
on a Hill left me feeling upset and depressed, but not in 
the wonderful way his previous albums have.
Artist: Castanets 
Album: Cathedral 
Released: October 19, 2004 
Genre: Derailed psych-country
Dont blame me for the genre name  that is how Cas
tanets Ray Raposa describes his music. Cathedral is the
first widely available Castanets album, and it enlists the 
help of members from great San Diego bands, includ
ing Pinback and Rocket from the Crypt. As for the actual 
sound, if the lead singers from Calexico and the Swans 
had a baby, theyd name him Ray Raposa. Most of the 
songs are slow and somber, so the few that actually carry

a beat are really fun to listen to. Unfortunately, Pinback 
seems to have brought along their love of the drum track. 
This album would be amazing if theyd get a drum set and 
weed out the similar sounding songs. However, it is still 
worth a listen if youre in the market for some derailed 
psych-country.

Album: This Affair Never Happened... And Here Are 
Eleven Songs About It 
Released: March 9, 2004 
Genre: Pop
To be blunt: This is a lame album title, but a great album. 
I admittedly know nothing about this band so I wont pre
tend that I do, but what else do you need when you can 
stick an album in your CD player and be happy from start 
to finish? This album is not overwhelmingly original or 
groundbreaking. In fact, most of the album sounds like 
its stolen from some random early pop band. Regardless, 
the beats are danceable and the lyrics are more inspired 
than youd expect. Im sure the live show is awesome. In 
fact, I havent wanted to see a bands live show this bad 
in a long time. I wish I were directing a hip new romanCourtesy of ticketactions.com

tic comedy so I could fill the soundtrack with songs from 
This Affair Never Happened. And thats a compliment, I

Artist: Interpol 
Album: Antics
Released: September 28, 2004 
Genre: Alternative rock
I have waited,two long and painful years for this album 
to come out. I spun their 2002 debut, Turn on the Bright 
Lights, repeatedly while they did tour after everywherebut-Pittsburgh tour and played Pepsi Smash on national 
TV to screaming preteens. I scoured Kazaa and Soulseek 
for crappy Dictaphone recordings of newly written songs 
while they released half of their Bright Lights tracks as 
overpriced special edition singles. I spread the Interpol 
love to everyone I came in contact with... for this? Its not 
that I hate this album, its just that they made us wait for 
it, kind of like the way Tool takes a hundred years to come 
out with a new album and its always awesome. I figured 
Antics took so long because they were preparing to blow 
our minds with their next level of cryptic lyrics. Instead it 
is overwhelmed with love songs with lyrics too sweet for 
Paul Banks voice. Slow Hands is the only song on the 
album I really dug. Honestly, I liked them better when 
they sang about couches and Vikings.

International Festival hungers for attention
Annual fest combines famine and feasts
The International Festival is in its 14th year at 
Carnegie Mellon, but is only in its third year as 
an event focused on a topic that can be applied to 
cultures around the world rather than on a single 
continent. Previously, the festival woul focus on 
a single continent each year, rotating among four 
regions  Europe; Latin America and the Carib
bean; Asia; and Africa. The more recent themed 
festivals include all cultures each year and have in
cluded topics in the past such as world religions. 
This year, the theme was food, focusing on both 
international cuisine and world hunger. Events 
ranged from large-scale events such as Iron Chef 
Masuharu Morimoto cooking up dishes in McConomy to intimate lectures on cooperatives in Pitts
burgh. The events were balanced between a focus 
on the actual foods (or beverages in some cases) 
that are served in various cultures and a perspec
tive on famine around the globe.
The International Festival attracted a good-sized 
crowd to most events, regardless of type, partly be
cause of its convenient placement on Family Week
end. The two events coincide through no coinci
dence: they have been paired together for the past 
eight years. Anne Witchner, coordinator for Family 
Weekend, has been witness to each International 
Festival, and at one time was the coordinator for 
the festival as well. Witchner believes that the joint 
nature of Family Weekend and International Fes
tival creates a good base of programming. The 
International Festival will be better attended, and 
the families visiting will have something to do on 
campus. Witchner has been present through the 
transition from the regionally concentrated festi
vals to the current themed festivals. She believes 
there were a few reasons for the change; one prob
lem with the regional festivals she said was be
cause, We would never be able to focus on, say, 
music that was representative of all Europe. She 
also mentioned that the goal of the festival remains 
the same, to provide a look at various cultures and 
increase awareness of them.
The current director of the International Festival is 
Emily Half, who was also able to speak a bit about the re
cent change from the rotating-continent-style festival to 
a topic that can be applied worldwide. Said Half, Every 
year, especially now that we have this global issues theme, 
we have a lot of current information running through the 
festival. Were bringing in speakers and events that are 
relevant to what is happening today... with historical ref
erence of course, but we are more looking at what we can 
do today.

Lon Durbin presented a lecture on cheese last Friday.
Another, albeit smaller, cooking performance took place 
in the Connan Room on Saturday. Smaller events had 
a closer feel, but were often fairly popular in their own 
right. Rania Harris, a local chef and owner of Ranias 
Catering, presented a lecture and demonstration tided 
Fun with Phyllo. While preparing Greek appetizers like 
spanakopita with phyllo, Harris spoke about her catering 
business in Mount Lebanon and her appearances on local 
television and in magazines such as BonAppetit. She also 
boasted, quite rightfully, about her skills with pastry. I 
can make an entire pan of baklava in seven minutes flat, 
she said.
Among the lectures offered on Friday was a cheese-tasting workshop in the Peter Room focusing on cheeses from 
the United Kingdom. Lon Durbin of Whole Foods Market 
lectured on the various methods and myths of cheese 
making, and also discussed the farmhouse and organic 
food movements sweeping both Great Britain and the 
United States. The audience was then able to sample vari
ous commercial and farmhouse cheeses available for sale 
at Whole Foods.
At one point in the workshop, Durbin proudly displayed 
the milk crates he used to bring the cheese to the lecture. 
Im dating myself, he announced, but you know whats 
great about dairy cases? LPs fit in them like they were 
made for them!
For those interested in more than cheese, various stu
dent organizations offered samples of international junk 
food in Rangos Ballroom. Among the organizations who 
prepared everything from spring rolls to samosas were
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Pi Delta 
Psi, Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture, Colombia en 
Pittsburgh, the Asian Student Association, the Taiwanese 
Student Association, the Vietnamese Student Associa
tion, OM, and Hapas.
Saturday afternoon featured two tea-themed events. One 
was a tasting and brief information session given by a lo
cal entrepreneur. Patricia Reiter, who blends a wide va
riety of homemade teas, gave a short speech and allowed 
audience members to sample a few of her blends. Reiter 
is the wife of a faculty member, and in addition to selling 
the tea she brews wholesale she also provides all the tea 
blends for Tealightful, a restaurant on Ellsworth Avenue. 
Reiter provided a quick education on a wide variety of 
teas and her talk was complimented nicely by the depth 
of flavor discovered in each of her blends.
The demonstrations continued with a traditional Japa
nese tea ceremony in Danforth Lounge. Yoko Motoyama 
and assistant Sally Schurko, dressed in traditional kimo
nos, enacted a short version of the tea ceremony, in which 
they prepared and then presented guests with a thin 
tea and sweets. After the demonstration, assistants of
fered audience members a sweet and a bowl of tea, show
ing them how to properly turn the bowl to appreciate its 
beauty and to slurp the tea to show thanks to the host.
Motoyama, although an uncertified tea master, is one of 
a relatively small number of people in the United States 
who can fully and properly perform the ceremony, which 
can take up to four hours. According to Schurko, Moto
yama gives unofficial lessons in her home. Were very 
grateful that we talked her into it, said Schurko.
Other small-scale events at the International Festival 
were more along the lines of Lappes lecture, focusing on

issues of the world market.for food, organic produce, and 
other similar issues. A talk given by members of the East 
End Food Cooperative allowed insight into a local group 
that vows to provide organic produce and offers fair pric
es to the workers from whom they buy. This session was 
a look at cooperatives in general, including a focus on 
food. A more cuisine-oriented talk was a lecture entirely 
devoted to bananas given by an extremely knowledge
able member of the history faculty, John Soluri. Soluris 
research gave him a strong basis to talk about the history 
of banana production and give insight into how the pro
cess has changed and what problems are in the business 
for those who labor in the countries that export a large 
amount of bananas. And, of course, Soluris knowledge 
of the banana plant itself gave an impressive depth to the 
presentation.
Other notable events of the festival included the annual 
International Bazaar at Rangos, which featured local res
taurants and craft vendors of varied ethnic backgrounds, 
as well as the Hunger Banquet. This banquet tries to 
give attendees first hand knowledge of what the worlds 
distribution of food is like  the few get an enormous 
quantity, the many get very little.
In its entirety, the International Festival provided a set
ting for information on the truth of world hunger and dis
enfranchised laborers. And on the lighter side, it allowed

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
Rockstars newest game lives up to the hype
For almost two years, even the casual gamer has been 
waiting for the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. 
Vice City set a precedent for PlayStation 2 games, com
bining outstanding graphics and gameplay with a real 
soundtrack that mirrored its setting. Rockstar Games 
latest addition to the series, Grand Theft Auto: San An
dreas, takes these strengths and builds on them. The re
sult is the most expansive GTA game to date.
GTA: San Andreas has a simple but well presented story: 
The year is 1992, and the main character is Carl CJ 
Johnson, a former small-time thug who left San Andreas 
to become clean in Liberty City. After five years he is 
called back home for his mothers funeral. On his arrival, 
he is quickly picked up by the local crooked police force, 
voiced by Samuel L. Jackson and Artie Lange, and thrown 
into his old neighborhood. After seeing the decjjne of his 
old gang, the Grove Street Crew, he decides to stay.
As Carl, the player must undergo a series of missions to 
bring his gang back to the top of the streets. This includes 
robbing trains, being the driver of drive-by shootings, 
and murdering rap stars. Gone are the secret passages 
placed throughout the game in the past versions, now 
replaced by more appropriate graffiti tags that must be 
sprayed over in order to gain respect in the city.
This version plays more like a role-playing game than any 
of the previous versions. The main character is viewed 
in a more personal role than in Vice City. Player profiles 
are defined by five levels: respect, stamina, muscle, fat, 
and sex appeal. The goal of the game is to control all un
derworld aspects of the West Coast state while making 
yourself a better all-around person. To do this you have 
to do things like eat at fast food restaurants, work out at 
local gyms, and buy clothes, shoes, and chains at various 
stores. Along with getting all of these right, youll also 
be up to the task of maintaining a relationship with your 
girlfriend Denise.
These games are not the only extras that San Andreas of
fers. Successful pieces from otfier games are incorporat
ed throughout the city. The Taxi and Vigilante modes of 
play, which give a Crazy Taxi-esque feel to the gameplay, 
return with the addition of a new mode, Pimping, where 
you shuttle prostitutes from place to place to earn a cut of 
their profits. Also incorporated into a series of missions is 
a mode where the controller buttons must be pressed in 
time to music, taken from Dance Dance Revolution.
San Andreas takes Carl through three distinct areas: Los 
Santos, San Fierro, and Los Venturas, which are created 
to represent, respectively, Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
and Las Vegas. Each of these venues is beautifully ren
dered and detailed thoroughly. The slums of Los Santos,

CJ tears down the streets of Calton Heights in GTA: San Andreas.
particularly Idlewood  a play on the real city of Ingle
wood  look like they were taken right out of a N.W.A. 
video.
The characters within the game are extremely well de
veloped and provide much of the entertainment in the 
game. Carls best friend, Big Smoke, is a fat thug who 
would rather eat than defend himself in a drive-by. One 
of his employers is O.C. Loc, a wannabe rapper who works 
flipping burgers. Loc asks CJ to steal a book of lyrics so he 
can make it big in the music industry. All of the roles are 
well acted and create realistic and sometimes hilarious 
situations.
Another aspect that contributes to the realism is the 
games varied soundtrack. Music from all genres blast 
from the speakers of any car you hijack. The artists fea
tured range from Rick James to Eddie Money to Bell Biv 
Devoe. Also featured on the cars radio stations are celeb
rity hosts like Axl Rose, George Clinton, and David Cross. 
These sounds, when accompanied by the well-rendered 
backdrop of urban slums and glamorous landmarks, cre
ate an unforgettably realistic experience.
GTA: San Andreas does have a few setbacks. Though it is 
easier for the player to focus his character using the dual 
joysticks for this version, often the player finds himself 
between views, creating slower game play. Also, since 
there is a deep plot and many learned skills for the char
acter, it is much more difficult to just pick up a controller 
and play a quick round or two.
GTA: San Andreas is more of an epic than any of the other 
GTA games. The huge selection of missions and situations 
create a game that could take months to complete fully. 
Improved graphics, enhanced game play, deep charac
ters, and a soundtrack that lives up in its predecessors 
makes San Andreas a definite upgrade from Vice City. It 
was well worth the wait.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Following.the advice of your favorite local 
astrologer, you will finally watch Spiderman 2 dubbed in Spanish, finding 
it much improved when a lack of language fluency nicely masks the painful 
dialogue and gaping plot holes, leaving you to gaze longingly at the young and 
beautiful co-stars.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): As the semester nears its end and you take a 
look at your grades so far, you will finally become motivated to apply yourself. 
To apply yourself to Panera, Sbarro, and every other mini-restaurant in the mall 
food court.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Stop all chewing on ice and peeling off bottle labels. 
Some people have even less promising dating futures, and you dont see monks 
being so openly sexually frustrated. Then again, Im sure someone somewhere is 
attracted to your fidgeting and other frustration-based eccentricities.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): A large plastic-wrapped ham is definitely a nice 
welcome gift for your new boyfriends parents (the Goldenbladts) when they 
drive over from New York for Parents Weekend. Some things just form lasting 
impressions, and that would definitely be pne of them.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): If you just act like you know youre cool, people 
will think you're cool. Unless, of course, they think youre full of illusions of 
grandeur or trying way too hard, and therefore (by reason of breaking the apathy 
rule) definitively uncool.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Thanks to the way your cartilage-filled ears 
and nose will naturally grow in size as you age, your facial features will finally 
reach a sort of equilibrium of proportions around age 65. Youll be beating em 
off with a stick... or, well, a cane anyway.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): What better way to show those hippie 
liberals that America cares about equity and womens rights than a nice 
egalitarian military draft for everyone?
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Tomorrow, a stranger will buy you 
flowers on the street. You will find the sentiment charming, even though you're 
allergic to pollen, and even though the strangers just a little bit strange.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Shes a Mac user and is only 
attracted to pretty things that she can easily interact with, regardless of how fast 
they can compute. So put some more mousse in your seductively windblown hair 
and make some beautiful babies together.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): You will buy a goldfish and a bowl. 
You will name the fish. You will develop a lovely, caring relationship based on 
mutual trust and dependence for at least a few years, until tragedy strikes. Then 
you will buy another goldfish to love and lavish with affection.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Getting a ham radio license and 
broadcasting from your basement will not necessarily guarantee an immediate 
influx of free CDs from your favorite Christian rock artists. Now maybe if you 
picked someone a little more desperate, like last years pop superstars...
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You will not realize the potential downside to 
being an introverted anthropologist until you get your degree and its too late.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Fernando almost jumped across the table to grab the poisoned entree 
off Marias plate, but he caught himself. To do that would ruin the 
whole charade. Besides, it was too late anyway. Maria had finished 
off the whole plate. Fernando felt panicked for a moment. He had unwittingly poisoned 
his one true love! But then he remembered that when Rogelio ingested the poison, there 
seemed to be no effect. If the poison was a dud, then Maria must be safe from harm. 
Fernando felt mostly relieved, but he still watched his two dinner guests with eagle eyes 
to see if the poison would take effect. Maybe it had a delayed effect, which would explain 
why Rogelio hadnt shown any signs of sickness yet. Minutes passed, but they seemed 
like months to Fernando. Neither of his guests exhibited any signs that the poison had 
entered their bodies. Fernando began to relax and enjoy the rest of the meal that he had 
prepared. Suddenly he heard a short cry from Marias end of the table. She had knocked 
over a glass of red wine. Fernando started to sop up the mess with his napkin when he 
noticed something else was wrong. Maria was clutching her throat and gasping for air!

Max takes on The Maxx
Ive actually written a lot about Sam Keith indirectly this 
semester. His name crops up every time Ive recounted 
important events in the last decade of comics. I pointed out 
two weeks ago how he was the original artist working with 
Niel Gaiman on Sandman in the late 80s. Ive been hesitant 
to write about him directly, though, because I dont know 
how well I can remain objective about an artist whom Ive 
admired and idolized since I was 10 years old.
The year was 1993 when I bought my first comic book. In 
response to the Saturday morning cartoon, I sought outXMen #2, written by Chris Claremont and drawn by Jim Lee. 
I had some extra change on me because I also intended to 
buy a pack of Fallen Empires cards, but instead the cover 
of another comic caught my eye, on which I spent the 
remainder of my allowance.
That comic was The Maxx, issue 3, by Sam Keith. It was 
fourth grade. Id never read a comic before. My literary 
repertoire didnt stretch past Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
or Star Wars. Id yet to experience any kind of tragedy first
hand. I lived in the suburbs of Ohio. On these and so many 
more levels I was wholly unprepared for what The Maxx 
delivered.
The comic is a sophisticated and surreal exploration of 
dreams and their relationship to childhood, adolescence, 
and adult life.
The third page, for example, was a panoramic spread. 
The image was divided into several fragment-shaped 
panels. Each panel captured, from the same scene, its own 
subject and point in time. Some panels showed the current 
moment, some showed what was about to happen, and 
some showed what had just happened. Furthermore, some 
fragments showed the same moment in an alternate dream 
reality, where objects are transformed into symbols of their 
own essential being. A blimp, for example, is in some places 
a giant floating whale.
Images like this and many more blew my poor mind.
The story follows a man in purple tights who calls himself 
The Maxx. Maxx is trapped between two worlds, one in 
which people think hes a schizophrenic street bum, and 
another wherein he is the king of a dream-jungle. The 
queen of the dream-jungle appears in the real world as 
a social worker named Julie, whos the only person who 
tolerates and pities Maxxs apparent insanity. Eventually
he discovers that the dream is not his own, but is in fact 
Julies. He also discovers that hes not the only interloper 
in her dreams.
Years later when I finally read the whole story, I would 
discover that neither Maxx nor Julie were really the main 
characters of the story. Rather, its a confused teenager 
named Sara whose issues with her rapist father and 
eventual coming of age are at the real center of the story.
Back in fourth grade, however, I didnt get to buy comics 
regularly, and I certainly couldnt be expected to keep up 
with whole series. So I had to content myself to read over 
this same issue over and over until I had every word and 
image ingrained in my mind. The door this comic opened 
for me led to a whole unimagined realm of ideas that has 
influenced me since. I have since met many people who 
have read the comic since coming to college, or watched 
the adaptation of it that was made for MTV in the mid
nineties; and despite liking the comic, I dont think their 
judgments really capture the meaning that the comic has 
for me.

Is the Maxx a real person caught in a woman's dream or 
a womans dream caught in the real world?
The key word is imagination. The are several adult 
readings of the story that were carefully intended by Keith, 
but even now I realize that the true power of the story is 
not in the humanity of Keiths characters or his priceless 
sense of humor, but in the infinite, childlike imagination, 
the flowering of imagery that comes from a unique 
artistic genius. He juxtaposes images and symbols in new 
relationships with the vigor of Salvador Dali, but always 
with a playful feel.
After three years of The Maxx, Keith found a good place to 
stop before it went sour and wrapped up the series. He has 
since written and drawn two more graphic novels that are 
themed around the inner emotional life of outcast girls: 
Four Women and Zero Girl. The latter has been described 
as more conceptually tight than The Maxx, but I think it 
lost some of the brushstrokes of child like innocence that 
Keith is so marvelous at capturing. Hes presently drawing 
a comic about a werewolf trapped in the boonies with an 
army of radioactive mutant babies called Scratch. Its a fun 
read to pick up every month, if youre looking for something 
to read.
