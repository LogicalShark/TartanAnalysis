War Dept. Announces 
College Program For 
Seventeen-Year-Old s
A new army-college program for 
youths seventeen years of age has 
just been announced by the War 
Department. The plan will provide 
free college training for any boy 
of this age who has passed the A-12 
examination which was given last 
April. All students participating 
will be sworn into the Army En
listed Reserve, and will enter the 
army for basic training at the close 
of the semester during which they 
reach 18.
The military scholarship is com
plete to the last detail. It provides 
for such necessary items as tuition, 
food, housing, and all medical serv
ice as is customary at the institu
tion. Time is another factor which 
has been carefully planned. The 
total week will include approximate
ly 57 hours of supervised activity, 
made up of 24 hours of classroom 
and laboratory work, 24 hours of re
quired study, and the balance devot
ed to military and physical instruc
tion. Because of their age, the re
servists will not be forced to pursue 
as strenuous a physical education 
program as do the regular ASTP 
men. If a student is sent to a col
lege where ROTC training is given, 
he will be given ROTC instruction 
in addition to his regular course of 
study.
This new program is expected to 
help meet the armys constant de
mand f >r high-grade technicians, 
specialists, and candidates for of
ficer training. Many of the stu
dents will be permitted to continue 
their studies under the regular 
ASTP program upon satisfactory 
completion of their 73 weeks basic 
training.
A quota of 25,000 youths has been 
set by the War Department. Alle
ghenys maximum is 300. All stu
dents who are eligible will receive 
notice soon. Classes will begin this 
summer.
Singing Strings Needed 
For Carnegie Orchestra
Is Tech to have an orchestra, or 
is Tech to have an orchestra? The 
plans, as originally stated, call for 
the organization of an orchestra 
right about this time, but what hap
pensno fiddlers. Thats rightno 
fiddlers. Could it be that over all 
the broad confines of Carnegie In
stitute of Technology there are but 
a few fiddlers. No! No again! And 
again; . Vic OBrien says, We 
need about fifteen more fiddlers if 
we are to have an orchestra. The 
other pieces are ready, waiting, 
eager to begin. If you play a fiddle 
to any degree of understanding. It 
is your privilege to join now. This 
applies to anyone on campusany
one. All that is required is that you 
have spirit and are fiddle conscious. 
Why not drop into the Music Office 
in Arts and give your qualifications? 
Why not do it now?
Bell Serenade
New Bell System Now 
Runs Life of Soldents
After life in the Tech Army had 
finally settled down to normal fol
lowing a rip-roaring paynight off, 
there arose a brand new problem 
to test the erudite minds of the local 
sojerssome dang fool went and in
stalled a brand-new bell system for 
to wake people up with and for to 
announce various and sundry infor
mations.
The first day of the new regime 
seemed to be rather noteworthy to 
a certain gang of guys who room 
just beside the new bell. Some un
precedented situations really arose. 
Arose hell, they ascended like the 
proverbial ostrich with an oversiz
ed appendage.
At seven-thirty Thursday even

it the menacethe menace first 
sounded off. At eight-thirtynine 
cases reported to the infirmary with 
an understandable malady. Their 
teeth just kept on chattering, their 
noses shimmied from side to side, 
their eyeballs rolled round and 
round and round. It was awful. One 
of the boys is still confinedstraitjacket case. He hears that tall 
brown-haired gal who runs after all 
the formations sayin, please kiss 
me some more on the 1927 bench if 
you dont mind.
At the eight-forty-five break, no 
one, not one single sojer, got up 
from his desk. That was an unpre
cedented event in the history of 
Tech ASTP. Even that sweet sarge 
who gigged some nasty boys for 
whistlin in the dark a few days ago 
couldnt understand it. But someContinued on page four
P. and D. Applicants 
Face Technical Tests
Starting Monday, July 12, and 
continuing through the following 
four days until July 15, the Painting 
and Design Department of the Fine 
Arts College of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology will give technical tests 
to aspirants for admission to that 
school. The tests will be given in 
the rooms on the third floor of the 
Fine Arts building. All applica
tions must be in by the middle of 
this week and do not obligate the 
applicant to attend the college if he 
or she passes the tests.
Unlike the College Entrance 
Board Examinations, the Painting 
and Design Technical tests endeav
or to select the most promising of 
the applicants. This is accomplish
ed by the peculiar nature of a tech
nical test. Each of the four days is 
devoted to a different phase of 
painting and design. Before each 
test begins the phase will be ex
plained and the applicants instruct
ed in how to do the work. Thus, the 
Technical tests measure the learn
ing ability of the aspirant under 
Carnegie Tech methods of instruc
tion.
PRESIDENT DOHERTY
Dr. Doherty Heads New 
Allegheny Conference 
On Postwar Planning
At a meeting last Tuesday of lead
ers in industry, labor, finance, civic 
affairs and government, Dr. Robert
E. Doherty was elected chairman of 
a permanent conference which was 
formed to stimulate and coordinate 
a program of post-war reconstruc
tion for Allegheny County.
The organization will be called 
The Allegheny County Conference 
on Post-War Community Planning. 
Dr. Willard E. Hotchkiss, head of 
the Department of Social Relations, 
was placed in charge of an overall 
committee on study and planning.
Committees will be appointed 
very soon to start work on the many 
phases of post-war rebuilding. The 
duties of these committees will cov
er economic development, housing 
and community development, high
way, street and bridge construction, 
and the financing of the program.
The scope of the organization is 
revealed in the following statement 
issued at the close of the confer
ence.
The proposal for an Allegheny 
County Conference on Post-war 
Planning was made in recognition 
of the fact that this metropolitan 
center constitutes a1 major indus
trial area which will encounter the 
stresses of post-war adjustments in 
concentrated form. It was also re
called that there are numerous pre
war problems such as land use and 
zoning, transportation, housing and 
recreation, smoke abatement and 
river pollution which are urgently 
in need of solution.
Particularly it was recognized 
that changes in technology have cre
ated particular hazards for a great 
metropolitan area whose previous 
economic activity has been largely 
concentrated on production and 
initial processing of basic raw ma
terials.
Notice
There will be an important 
Freshman Orientation Meeting on 
Thursday, July 8, at 4 p.m., in the 
Little Theater, Arts Building.
Alpha Phi Omega 
Orients Freshmen
Alpha Phi Omega, the only serv
ice organization on the campus, is 
coming through again with an ex
cellent job that will be a muchneeded bolster to our school spirit. 
On authorization of the ACAC, Ed 
Uber and his boys have taken in 
hand the Freshman Orientation, be
ginning their program with an AllFrosh meeting on Thursday, July
8, at 4 p. m., in the Little Theater. 
At this gathering members of the 
faculty and prominent students will 
give talks on the history and tradi
tions of Carnegie Tech, and mime
ographed copies of the school songs 
and cheers will be distributed to all 
Freshmen present.
The boys of 47 will have an added 
opportunity to familiarize them
selves with our customs at the Tues
day night sings in the Sylvan The
ater. Every week they will be able 
to croon the old Tech songs and 
shout out the cheers that have led 
many a Tartan team to victory. The 
glee club will be there to add some 
quality to quantity, and our beau
tiful cheerleaders alone should be 
incentive enough to attract every 
one.
At the end of tne semester APO 
will hold a traditions examination 
for all Freshmen. They will be re
quired to know our songs and 
cheers, a few important data about 
Carnegie Tech and its history, and 
the names and titles of the outstand
ing members of faculty and admin
istration. A passing grade in this 
test will be required for participa
tion in all extra-curricular activi
ties, for it is felt that a student 
should be familiar with the tradi
tions of this college in order to be a 
good member of the Tech com
munity. Every Freshman should un
derstand this, and APO therefore 
expects every new student to give 
his full cooperation to this project, 
a thing which will be as valuable 
for them as it is for the school in 
general.
149 Students Enroll For 
Carnegie Summer Session
One hundred and forty-nine stu
dents have enrolled in the twentysixth Summer Session of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. This ses
sion, which lasts from June 28 to 
August 7, is part of the regular ac
ademic year at Tech. Students 
starting in the Summer Session may 
continue working in the regular se
mesters if they are trying to get a 
diploma.
Those enrolled in the summer 
have the use of the same equipment 
and materials as the regular stu
dents. By going to school in the 
summer, they may also earn credits 
which may be combined with those 
earned during the regular semesters 
or in part-time and evening courses.
These courses enable persons who 
have been away from education to 
broaden their viewpoints by ad
vanced study.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 1943
Higher Education and 
The Post War WorldBy Dr. Martin Chworowski
This is the second in the series of articles we are printing in the hope 
of stimulating thoughts towards post-war planning.
There are many people who sincerely believe that we are in this 
war to preserve for ourselves and posterity the traditions of liberal, west
ern civilization. Others say we have taken up arms to prepare for a new 
world which has been long struggling to be born. Still others maintain 
we are in this war to defend our own way of life. Whichever view of the 
present situation one mayf#take, regardless of whether he believes we fight 
to maintain the status quo, to preserve our social, heritage, or to reconstruct 
our way of life, there is one matter on which everyone will agree: that it 
is the function of higher education to advance the frontiers of knowledge 
and to educate men and women for positions of leadership in their society.
When, however, men with different objectives agree on a proposition, 
it is well to be skeptical. Means and ends are not inseparable: if the terms 
mean anything at all, they are related as cause and effect. Moreover, in the 
social realm, they operate not as mechanical forces but as organic stimuli 
and responses. The contemplated effect influences the cause, as well as 
does the cause help to bring about a desired result.
If we take the above thought and apply it to the statement about the 
role of higher education, certain important queries emerge. Thus it be
hooves us to weigh carefully if we are not to mistake reflective thinking for 
wishful dreaming.
In the first place, if higher education is to fulfill its role, in research and 
training of leadership, it must critically examine the trends and direc
tions of its efforts. To do this, each institution must formulate clearly the 
philosophy on which it operates so that it can more clearly and critically 
evaluate the worth of its endeavors in realizing its goal, and in re-evaluat
ing the goal itself.
In the second place, each institution must examine its administrative 
set-up to see if its organization is the most effective one for implimenting 
its philosophy. Government by the consent of the governed once was 
more of a reality in academic life in America than it is today. As Amer
ica gropes for a betterment of its democratic life, need we not re-examine, 
for example, the tradition in higher education of having the boards of 
trustees of our institutions made up almost exclusively of business and 
professional men? Need we not examine the theory of administration to 
see if it squares with our democratic aspirations? There is much to sug
gest that educational administration in America took over its pattern of 
organization from industry, which in turn took its ideal from the military, 
in the days when the ideal soldier was one who blindly obeyed, regardless.
In the third place, there must be a critical examination of the nature of 
teaching and of the teacher-student relationship. When we teach, we 
teach more than information; when we learn, we learn more than what 
goes by the name of knowledge. We learn our behavior. And if teachers 
act as impersonal autocrats, even though they be fountains of knowledge, 
students will become more slave than freeman-minded; and as for leading 
them to waterwell try to make them drink!
These three queries, as I see it, represent the sine qua non for institu
tions of higher learning if they are going to do effective work in the post 
war world. Having clarified their philosophies and put their house in order 
by making their administration and instruction express what they pro
fess, they will be ready to tackle the next problem. This problem is one of 
relating the institution to the community it serves. Here new avenues 
must be explored and opened. One thing is clear, the old tradition of gown 
and town has broken down. Institutions of higher learning cannot exercise 
effective leadership in a vacuum. They cannot exercise leadership by 
proxy; they must become part and parcel of the life round about them. 
It is at this point that so much of the present discussion of post-war plan
ning becomes most relevant to colleges and universities. Their very con
tinued existence is dependent of aggressive leadership in this area of put
ting a stop to social drift and striving for increasingly more mastery of our 
social destiny.
We are making the foundations of the post-war world even while we 
fight for our lives. Make no mistake about it; more difficult as as it does 
make our task, we cannot give our best to winning the war unless we alsp 
start working to make the realization of our dreams of a better world a 
growing reality.

It was quite an adventure locat
ing George, but, as the deadline 
time came dangerously near, I found 
him in a classroom partly hidden by 
a senior social relations book. He 
quickly explained that his professor 
gives tests on the book material.
George is the kind of fellow who, 
after five minutes, makes you feel 
that youve known him for a life
time. He has a keen sense of 
humor, is well versed on most sub
jects, and has a knack for carrying 
on an interesting conversation. He 
is a fiend at table tennis, plays chess 
incessantly, and is one of those rare 
fellows at Tech who writes poetry; 
ask any of the last semester juniors 
about his immortal The Saga of C.
B. Hill. He doesnt smoke (this is 
rare in itself), but he is a religious 
appreciater of good wine. A smooth 
dance orchestra is his preference 
and as for femininity, he likes it 
blonde and short (or is it short 
and blonde?)
Besides riding streetcars to and 
from school, a few of his activities 
have been the following: President 
of Citcom Clan, President of Eta 
Kappa Nu (E. E. Honorary), Editor 
of Citcommentator and of Com
muter, Member of Pi Delta Epsilon 
(Journalism Honorary), Member of 
Citcoms Executive Board and Pres.. ACAC Minutes..

Interviews and Tests 
Determine Tech ASTP
By Pvt. Max Oirich
These soldiers we see marching 
to and from classes on the campus, 
carrying their books on economic 
geography and American history 
and engineering drawingwho are 
they? What is the purpose of their 
being here?
Why they are here must remain a 
military secret, but the manner in 
which they were chosen is inter
esting. The program was organized 
because of the need for more collegetrained men in the army. Since 
there arose the problem of segregat
ing those who were qualified to re
ceive this training; a number of 
basic requirements were introduced. 
The very first requirement was a 
grade of not less than 115 on the 
Army General Classification Test. 
Those who had a lower markand 
there were manywere not consid
ered. The second requirement was 
the possession of a high school di
ploma.
Those who were still qualified 
were given the Army Specialist 
Training Test. The soldiers who 
passed this examination were order
ed to appear before a board of highranking officers for personal inter
views. If the interviews proved suc
cessful, the trainees were sent to 
Specialist Training Assignment 
and Reclassification units where 
they were given more interviews 
and more aptitude tests. In this 
manner, were weeded out those who 
were in any way unfit for the in
tensive courses which are part of 
the ASTP. But even among those 
who are accepted there may be mis
fitsdespite the stringent require
ments; so all who do not pass their 
courses for the first semester are 
sent back. Those soldiers who have 
surmounted all these obstacles are 
indubitably the best qualified to go 
to college.

recently been promoted to the rank 
of Lieutenant Colonel, as announc
ed by Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers, 
chief of armored forces. After grad
uating from Carnegie, Blair was 
commissioned in the Corps of En
gineers in 1935 and called to active 
duty at Fort Knox with the grade 
of First Lieutenant in 1940. Since 
then Blair was commissioned with 
the Ordnance Department in 1940 
and has served with the First Arm
ored Division where he received his 
Lieutenant-Colonelcy.
John P. Schaffer of Pittsburgh, a 
former Techite, is now study me
teorology at New York University 
under the direction of the Army Air 
Forces Technical Training Com
mand. After the completion of his 
preliminary training this summer, 
Schaffer will begin advanced meterology as an aviation cadet. After 
eight months of this advanced train
ing, he will be commissioned a Sec
ond Lieutenant and assigned to a 
tactical unit of the Army Air Forces 
with the responsibility of providing 
pilots with accurate weather infor
mation.
In the United States Army where 
time is a vital element, every sec

long distances are to be spanned. 
Charged with the responsibility of 
maintaining constant vigilance over 
the intricate telephone network of 
the Army Air Forces at Bolling

Blood Donor Service 
Announces Schedule
Due to laboratory restrictions and 
shipping schedules, the Pittsburgh 
Blood Donor Service of the Amer
ican Red Cross has reduced the 
number of hours on its schedule.
The new hours are from 2 p.m. to
8 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, and 
Fridays; from 12 noon to 6 p.m. on 
Wednesday and Thursday; and from
10 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturdays. 
The new schedule will last until 
September 4.
The Pittsburgh Blood Donor Serv
ice has collected more than 150,000 
pints of blood since the service was 
inaugurated in November, 1941. 
Many donors have given nine times, 
and many are seven or eight-time 
donors.
Although the hours have been 
shortened, the quota for blood has 
not. Now it is more important than 
ever that appointments be kept, for 
every hour must be filled in order 
to complete the minimum of 4,000 
pints per week.
To make an appointment, write to 
the Pittsburgh Blood Donor Service 
at the Investment Building, 237

Dear Techites, did you happen to 
notice a lonesome platoon to the 
ripp, by the reet flank hutting all 
over the Cut on Saturday afternoon? 
Well, the reason for all that, which 
up till now has been a closely guard
ed military secret, is herein released 
absolutely inside dope (Its some 
dope.) Some jerk slipped a mickey 
to the alarm bell on Friday night, 
so it wouldnt ring for reveille the 
next morning; he slipped a wad of 
cotton twixt the banger and the 
clanger.
Be seein you. To the ringing and 
the tingling of the bells, bells, bells, 
bells.

For two years Miss C. J. Douglas 
of the science department at Mar
garet Morrison College has been 
faithfully experimenting with white 
rats. To the casual observer the 
subject of rats is not especially in
teresting, but the eyes of this report
er were indeed opened after a short 
visit with Miss Douglas.
Two years ago a research fellow, 
Dr. Joseph L. Svirbely, began in
tensified experiments on these white 
rats. His partner was the winner 
of the Nobel prize for experiments 
on Vitamin C. The problem to be 
solved was to determine the effect 
of various substances, such as drugs, 
on the Vitamin C content of dif
ferent rat tissues. Dr. Svirbely tried 
to discover where the animal makes 
the Vitamin C and from what foods 
it comes. After long experimenting, 
he went to laboratories of the Na
tional Institute of Health to do con
tinued animal experimental work.
After Dr. Svirbely left, Miss 
Douglas began to conduct similar 
experiments on white rats. So far, 
she has tried insulin and sulpha 
drugs, without, however, obtaining 
significant results. The outcome of 
these experiments is very import
ant, since the lessons derived from 
them may someday be applied to 
human beings.
Your reporter, whose interest in 
the white rats became very much 
stimulated, asked to see them. With
Miss Douglas in the lead, we went 
down two flights by elevator, 
through a locked door, across a room 
and into a small, secluded nook, 
that contained the specimens. On 
the walls of the room were shelves 
on which were arranged cages con
taining male and female white 
rats. Miss Douglas took one cage 
off the shelf and began fondling 
them. Your reporters love for rats 
was not sufficient to prompt him to 
do likewise. On one wall were two 
cages where two female and one 
male rat were enclosed. The female 
rats were in their gestation period 
and are expected to bear young ones 
shortly.
Miss Douglas held out a tube con
taining Vitamin E and a mad 
scramble ensued as the rats tumbled 
over each other fighting for the 
liquid. Frequently Miss Douglas 
feeds the sulpha drugs to the rats 
through a stomach tube. After suf
ficient time, the rats are killed and 
then their tissues containing Vit
amin C are extracted. They are 
ground, treated with acid, and 
go through a titration process. In 
this way Miss Douglas is aware of 
any new or unusual developments.
Although predictions may be 
made now with some degree of cer
tainty, Miss Douglas prefers to wait 
until the near future, when she will 
publish the results of her experi
ments in official form.

Should freshmen be forced to 
learn the traditions and songs of 
Carnegie? Should they wear some
thing to distinguish them from ..yperclassmen? These were questions 
put to a cross-section or Tech fac
ulty and students. All agreed that 
it was necessary to know at least a 
little about the schools background 
and all differed on how this should 
be accomplished. Rugged individu
alists among the freshmen, who may 
object to the coming tradition 
exams, will find some kindred spir
its in this columnif thats any con
solation. Armbands and caps for 
first-year men was also a debatable 
subject; theoretical, of course, since 
this year they will wear nothing to 
distinguish them from their elder 
brethren.
Mr. Freimarck, English instruct
or, is of the opinion that, if a tradi
tion is worthwhile, it will be banded 
down from generation to generation 
without the need of its being forced
upon the students. Caps and arm
bands, far from being degrading, 
look well.
Bob Noyes, chemistry junior and 
A C A C member, believes that 
everyone should learn something of 
the college he attends. He hasnt 
heard any of the freshmen singing 
school songs and certainly would 
like to hear them sung. Anyone who 
does not pass the tradition exam 
should not be allowed to take part 
in extra-curricular activities, for a 
student who is too lazy to master 
the required information is too lazy 
to succeed in any team or organ
ization. Though traditions and songs 
should be learned, war or no war, 
such things as caps have no place 
on a wartime campus.
Albert Perry, electrical engineer
ing freshman, wants everything left 
to the individual, with no violent 
punishment for those who remain 
ignorant of Techs history.
She falls for any man who 
wears an Arrow Tie!
Nothing looks so well on a male chest as an Arrow

Last week the first round of the 
Intramural mushball season was al
most completed, with but four pre
viously postponed games yet to be 
played. Cameron hall heads League
I, and even though they have one 
game yet to be played, are virtually 
certain of retaining that position 
since that one game is with the 
weak last place Cedar Hall nine. 
The PiKAs and A-l will have to 
battle it out in a playoff for the 
championship of League II, since 
they both have finished the season 
with .833 averages. This ought to 
be a real game to see, for the hurl
ing of Brier of the PiKAs matched 
against the superlative teamwork of 
the A-l squad will create a good 
tight seven innings of play. The rul
er of League III has not been deter
mined, for the two leaders have yet 
to play, and the championship hing
es on the result of that contest. A 
prediction, perhaps rash, would be 
that the up-and-coming Citcom 
squad would defeat the sliding A-3 
boys in that contest.
Monday, Beta Theta Pi pulled out 
of a tie for last place in League II 
by defeating the TXs 9-5. The Betas 
garnered the astronomical number 
of 21 hits, but were helpless too 
many time with men on base, a fact 
which kept the game from being a 
walk-away. Corv/in of the Beta Sigs 
allowed but 7 hits as his teammates
stowed another victory in the bag 
by squeezing out a victory over the 
A-5 squad, 4 to 3. The PiKAs de
feated the SAEs 4 to 2, Irwin Breier 
allowing 8 hits, the most he has al
lowed all season. The Delts got 4 
runs off 2 hits from Citcom, but 
were powerless to stop the onrushing commuters as they hung up 
their second victory, 9 to 4.
The last day of the scheduled 
season saw Citcom turn in another 
win as they shellacked the Tau 
Delts 14 to 1. Dick Arnold of Citcom 
gave up 3 hits, for a total of but 5 
in his last two starts. The army 
boys from the third platoon of Com
pany B trounced the TXs 10 to 3 
to keep the hesitating fraternity 
men in the cellar of League II. Cam
eron Hall made sure of winning the 
first round in League I by defeating 
the DUs 4 to 2, behind the master
ful two hit hurling of Phil Pfleeger. 
The Kappa Sigs and the Delts bat
tled it out both physically and ver
bally for nine innings on field two 
after the score was tied up at 9 all 
by a 4 run Kappa Sig rally in the 
sixth. John Lindberg poled out a 
tremendous homer in the ninth with 
one on to give the Clyde Street boys 
the lead, and though the Delts tal
lied once more, their final bid was 
halted when the tying run was tag
ged out at the plate as he attempted 
to score. Final score: 11 to 10.
The only game on Wednesday was 
the Tau Delt, Kappa Sig massacre 
which the Tau Delts won 14 to 4. 
Misfortune hit Milt Perloff of the 
Tau Delts when he fell and fractur
ed his leg while warming up be
tween innings.
Four postponed games were play
ed off on Thursday, the Citcom Clan 
winning its third of the week in one 
of them, 8 to 6 as they fought out 
an 8 inning decision over B-4&5. 
Bob Scott did an excellent job for 
the losers while Dick Arnold turned 
in his fourth straight win for the 
Clan. The PiKAs won again when 
the TXs were held powerless at the 
plate by Breiers 2 hit performance. 
The TXs got 3 runs but they were 
by far insufficient to top the PiKAs 
eight. B-l and A-5 went on a scor
ing spree on field two as they com
pleted the circuit 26 times. A-5 came 
out on the short end of a 10 to 16 
score, however.
Several postponed games were 
scheduled for Friday, July 2, but the 
scores to these games were not ob
tainable soon enough before for 
press time.

Here at Tech we have many good 
athletes both amateur and semipro, They represent nearly every 
field of sports and nearly every sec
tion of the country.
Now that the men are here at 
Tech, what is going to be done about 
it? The way the set-up is at present 
nothing. The real reason why the 
Army will not let the A.S.T.P.ers 
compete in varsity athletics at their 
respective schools remains more or 
less of a secret to us. The best we 
can do towards finding the answer 
to our question are two minor an
swers. The Army does not approve 
of (1) contact or competitive sports, 
(2) or the so-called spectator 
sports. The Army prefers more 
strenuous sports such as volleyball, 
softball, and touch football rather 
than the softie games of football, 
baseball, and basketball. It is indeed 
a shame that many good athletes 
have given up the sports they love 
to join the Army, only to find they 
cannot participate in them any long
er because of some old Fogie 
ideas possessed by the U.S. Army. 
If only they would stop to consider 
that all work and no play makes 
Jack a dull boy.
There are undoubtedly good ci
vilian athletes at Tech whom the 
athletic program will utilize, but it
Bob Scott 
takes more than a handful of ath
letes to comprise an all-around 
schedule. There are civilians here 
that are of varsity caliber, but re
alizing their education is vitally 
needed by our government, they do 
not plan to compete in anything for 
the duration. In order to replace 
these men in the field of sports and 
to keep the nations interest in 
sports awake, something urgent 
must be done. One way of arriving 
at a satisfactory answer to the, prob
lem is for the Army to loosen up on 
its regulations. If, and I do mean 
IF, these B.M.O.C.s were allowed 
to compete with Tech, I see no rea
son why C.I.T. could not have a win
ning athletic program.

Introducing Mr. and Mrs. Gulliver alias Private Bill Deacon and wife Carol.
You have probably seen her down 
in the Grill these past two weeks 
and wondered who she was. That 
pretty, dark-eyed little girl with the 
luscious complexion and the upswept blonde hair is Carol Deacon, 
ASTP wife. When her husband, Pri
vate Bill Deacon, went to the Army 
in January, she debated for weeks 
whether or not to join him, and fin
ally in April decided that she would. 
She left her Baldwin, Long Island, 
home for Paris, Texas, where her 
husband was in the Field Artillery. 
Her Texas visit lasted for one week 
end; the Monday after she got there 
Bill was transferred to Stillwater, 
Oklahoma. He left Texas on a troop 
train, and she followed after he had 
found her living quarters in Still
water. There she had a light house
keeping apartment with a wonder
ful landlady who invited them to 
Sunday dinner. She even had a 
Victory Garden in Stillwater. But 
in three weeks Bill was transferred 
from the ASTP receiving station at 
Oklahoma A & M to Tech. Carol 
came here on May 22.
For the past two weeks she has 
been working in the Grill and lik
ing it, even though she has to get 
up at 6:30 to be at work at 7:30. She 
used to get up at 12:00 or 1:00 in 
the afternoon, but no more. One 
nice feature about working in the
