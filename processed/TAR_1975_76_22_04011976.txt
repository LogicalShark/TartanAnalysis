Yearly Tuition goes up $200 to $1200
President J. C. Warner has announced a 
tuition increase of SI00 per semester at 
i Carnegie Institute of Technology.
The raise, which wont go into effect 
until September, 1961, will boost Carne
gies tuition cost to S600 per semester 
$ and will apply to all departments.
In explaining to the students and their 
parents the necessity of such a raise, Dr. 
Warner pointed out that higher education 
costs have tripled since 1940. This rise, as 
he noted, not only reflects trends in the 
national economy, but also the realization 
that there is considerable catching up to 
do if students are to continue to receive 
the best possible quality education.
Subsidizing Education 
Currently, he observed, there is a wide 
gap between tuition income and educa
tional costs, and in fact, Carnegie Tech is 
now subsidizing every students education.
-The Carnegie President estimated that stu
dents now pay only about 50'/ of total 
educational costs, with the remainder com
ing from endowment.gifts, and other non
tuition sources.
Dr. Warner emphasized that tuition for 
the current year will remain unchanged. 
Being a parent myself," he said, 1 know 
that family budgets must have a chance to 
adjust, so Carnegie has decided to give a 
years advance notice of this increase. A 
following letter to this effect has been sent 
to each Carnegie Tech student and his 
parents.
TO CARNEGIE STUDENTS AND THEIR 
PARENTS:
Today Americas colleges and universi
ties are facing an inescapable fact with 
caution and foresight. The cost of higher 
education has more than doubled since
1940.
The rise reflects trends in the national 
economy plus the realization tha there is 
considerable catching-up to do so that our 
students will continue to receive the best 
possible education which a quality universi
ty like Carnegie must offer. Only a strong 
force of intelligent young men and women 
can solve the complexities already apparent 
in the decade ahead.
Carnegie is not a profit making institu
tion; in fact it is subsidizing every students 
education because the gap between tuition 
and income and educational costs is a wide 
one. Even now students pay only about 50 
per cent of that cost; the remainder is met 
almost equally by income from endow
ment, gifts, and other non-tuition sources.
The administration and trustees now 
find it necessary to the maintenance of 
this university and for the educational welCyert Named Dean of GSIA
Richard M. Cyert has been appointed 
dean of the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration and William R. Dill as asso
ciate dean. The appointments became ef
fective February 1.
Professor Cyert has been at Carnegie 
Tech since 1948. He is currently professor 
of industrial administration and head of 
y the department of industrial management.
Ph.D. from Columbia University.
Background
He has been director of a large scale 
research project, Behavioral Theory ol the 
Firm, sponsored by the Ford Foundation 
which is considered to be the first of its 
kind employing an electronic computer as 
a simulation device in economics. As a 
result of his research, he expects to publish 
three books this year: A Behavioral Theo
ry of the Firm, with J. C.. March, Market 
Structures and the Theory of the Firm, 
with K. J. Cohen, and Quantitative Tech
niques in Accounting, with H. Justin 
Davidson. All of. the books will be 
published by Prentice-Hall.
Professor Cyert was recently elected 
vice president in charge of research and 
education of the Institute of Management 
Sciences and is chairman of the Institutes 
research committee. He is also a member of
the American Statistical Association's 
committee on Statistics in Accounting. 
He is widely known among accountants 
and auditors as one of the tew theoretical 
statisticians who has enough understanding 
of accounting to place statistics in practical 
application in our fields.
Professor Cyert is a consultant to the 
federal government, for the Gull Oil Cor
poration, and the accounting firm ol
Touche, Ross, Bailey and Smart. He was 
the organizer of the original group develop
ing the Carnegie Management Game which 
has been an unqualified success. He has 
written many articles in leading journals 
in the fields of economics, accounting, sta
tistics, and management, and is co-author 
of Sampling Techniques in Accounting,

Dr. Warner
fare of her students to increase tuition 
SI00 per semester effective September, 
1961, in all departments on the campus.
It is a matter of principle at Carnegie 
that a lack of money will not bar worthy 
students from college study. Financial aid 
through scholarships and loans is substan
tial and will be increased as necessary to 
provide the help.that is needed.
I m sure you will agree with me that a 
college education is still a fine personal as
set, which over the years will continue to 
appreciate in value.
The only way we can protect this life
long investment you are making is by pro
viding the best teachers and the best learn
ing facilities possible. This increase in tui
tion is an important means to that end.
Sincerely yours,
J.C. WARNER

Tech Lost in Darkness as Power Fails
Professor Richard M. Cyert
Commenting on his appointment. Dr. 
Warner said, It is fortunate tor Carnegie 
Tech that a man such as Professor Cyert is 
available to continue the fine work done 
by Dean Bach. Professor Cyert has been 
on the faculty of the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration since its found
ing and has contributed much to its unique 
success. I feel certain that the school, 
under him, will continue the growth which 
has placed it among the finest business 
schools in the country.
A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
Professor Cyert received his B.S. degree 
from the University of Minnesota and his
Senators Resign
With the resignation of several senators 
this week. Student Government Piesident 
Vince Misitano called the Student Senate 
nothing but a big rubber stamp. and sug
gested that in the future monthly Senate 
meetings would be sufficient.
Presently, Senate meetings are held 
weekly.
The senators who resigned fell that the
Conti mind on tour
Last Friday at 6:25 p.m., a two-and-ahalf foot power conduit behind Engineer
ing and Science Hall snapped and tugged 
main power lines out of the earth for sev
eral hundred yards.
The campus was left completely dark 
after the break occurred on the south side 
of Engineering Hall where they were doing 
excavation work for a two-story addition 
to the physics department.
Power lines were severed to GSIA. the 
Fine Arts building. Skibo, Engineering and 
Science Hall, the Hunt Library, Adminis
tration Hall, and the mens dormitories.
The reason for the failure was blamed 
on workmen who had driven trucks over a 
concrete housing for the conduit, which 
because of the excavation work was unsup
ported below.
Crews were immediately called in from 
the Duquesne Power and Light Company 
to repair the damage. Beginning work late 
Friday evening, the crews worked feverish
ly through the week-end until early Mon
day morning, when powei was restored. 
They laid out the wires on the I & S and

Although most of the lines have not

While they worked, emergency lighting,

in all public buildings, was pul inn use 
where it existed.
Fraternity houses over the week-end 
were packed with freshman pledges and 
actives, as they sought light in the fraterni

was unaffected by the power break.

Tech Gets G-20
An all-transistorized remotely controlled 
computer, capable of fifty thousand com
putations in a second, will be installed in 
Carnegie Tech Computation Center some
time next fall.
One hundred and fifty times faster than 
its present equipment, the new Bendix 
G-20 high speed data processing system 
will make Carnegie Techs Computation 
Center one of the most advanced and com
pletely equipped of its kind.
Remote Control
One of the unique aspects of the 
G-20, according to Dr. Alan C. Perlis, 
Head of the Computation Center, is that 
it can be remotely controlled from differ
ent buildings on the campus. Thus, the 
various research centers can supply data

Page 2THE NATRATApril 1, 1976editors note
Hold Everything
Every Monday, the TARTAN staff receives from the print
er a set of page proofs to be checked and changed before 
Wednesday's edition. At this time authors changes and print
ing corrections are specified.
Corrections alone which were indicated for a page one 
story last week on the elections of officers to Men's Dormi
tory Council cost the TARTAN exactly $18.00. This bill 
submitted this morning to Allan Pollock, who in that ballot
ing was elected president of M DC.
Ordinarily the bill is covered by advertising, circulation, 
and administrative subsidies, but in this case, the TARTAN 
felt thatthe bill should be paid by Mr. Pollock.
Questions raised by one of our reporters, the layout 
editor, a proofreader, and several other members of the 
staff give strong indication that it was Mr. Pollock who, 
without authorization, instructed the printer to make the 
particular changes in the MDC story. (The TARTAN in 
fact is in possession of the page proof on which appears 
his handwriting specifying these changes.)
Mr. Pollock directed the printer to re-arrange the front 
page and to lengthen the story about Mens Dormitory 
Council elections, with sole purpose, apparently, of in
flating his prestige among the students 6f this campus, this 
was done AFTER the page proof had been checked AND 
OKd by the news editor, desk editor, and the executive 
editor.
Without known precedence, Mr. Pollock has usurped 
this organization , and in doing so, has deliberately given 
himself more recognition than the TARTAN felt he, or the 
MDC elections, deserved. (The extent of coverage for 
Womens Dormitory Council Council elections was three 
sentences, without a photograph.)
Regardless of our differences in judgement, nothing can 
rightfully explain his action.
Mr. Pollock may claim that he had certain authority by 
which could change final TARTAN page proofs. Until the 
appointment last spring of the 1964-1965 TARTAN staff 
he was serving as its managing editor: Since that time 
however, he has contributed nothing to the operations of 
this newspaper.
He may also contend that the article was more about 
the election of him rather than the activities of the coun
cil, and by virtue of his recently-acquired position, could 
claim a part in the decision of its length and placement. 
This would be as absurd , especially this year, as the editorin-chief of the TARTAN making final decisions for Mens 
Dormitory Council.
Because. Mr. Pollock this year is in no way affiliated 
with the campus newspaper, he simply has NO right to 
decide how We shall run it. The TARTAN staff cannot, 
and does not intend to direct him in the operations of HIS 
organization. But, he has already suggested that he holds a 
self-claimed authority over us in the operations of OUR 
organization.
As president of Mens Dormitory Council, Mr. Pollock 
will serve on both Executive Council of Student Congress 
and the Undergraduate Advisory Committee. (The former 
is the administrative branch of student government; the 
latter is a committee on student problems which serves to 
advise the Dean of the Division of Student Affairs.)
Considering that Mr. Pollock now holds three positions 
of significant proportion on campus, he must be made to 
realize that, along with power, each position of leadership 
carries with it certain responsibilities and limitations. Some 
things just can and cannot be done.
We expect him, in the least, to pay the bill for printers 
charges that he received this morning.
With this payment, we also expect, and shall demand, ai
formal statement by him explaining the reasons for his un
justified encroachment. The TARTAN staff can demand no 
more of him.

For those of you that havent noticed yet. this special

An Open Letter 
To the Administration
We would like to compliment 
you on the successful comple
tion of your ten year develop
ment program. We note with 
pride some of the more worthy 
achievements:
1. The installation of 15 
cent pay toilets in Scaife 
Hall.
2. The installation of a 25 
cent turnstile at the en
trances of all major build
ings, (although this is 
often expensive for stu
dents with classes in seve
ral different buildings. 
Also, it has been said, that 
the 25 cent fee to go from 
AH to Porter Hall is com
pletely unreasonable.)
3. The announcement of a 
50 cent charge for the 
Fine Arts elevator (al
though the stairway is on
ly 10 cents.)
4. The increase to 35 cents 
the charge for using a sho
wer in the gym. (Necessa
ry because many indivi
duals were taking liberties 
with the hot water.)
5. The charge of 20 cents to 
use the Morewood eleva
tor. (Although sometimes 
unreasonable when a girl 
wants to get a 5 cent can
dy bar in the basement.)
All of these innovations in 
the school policy suggest a need
After the Fall
for some way for the student to 
save money. I think the answer 
lies in the philosophy of the 
administration as stated in the 
February 13 1963 TARTAN: 
 . . . allow a very flexible 
program, pay only as you use... 
It will no longer be necessary to 
purchase ... at a fixed rate . .. 
(something) that quite often is 
used only a few days a week.. . 
The obvious references to the 
payment of $995 a semester for
tuition. Why not pay as you 
attend class, so that you can save 
money when you cut? Why 
should a student pay for a seat 
in a class that he is not using? 
Just give a student a ticket at 
registration that would make 
him eligible to use the classes.

Eating Skibo Scrod
Editor, The TARTAN:
We feel that the printing of 
the song Eating Skibo Scrod 
was in very bad taste. A few 
picky individuals get a little 
meat in their grissle and immedi
ately a barrage of complaints is 
directed at the hard working 
Skibo staff.
Our opinion is that the diet 
is very well planned and that 
the meals are quite tasty. Take
breakfast for instance; maybe 
the powdered eggs arent so 
good, but the dry cereal is terri
fic and the hot cakes are the kind 
you really have to sink your 
teeth into. At dinner the water 
is cold and clear, and the fresh, 
melt-in-your-mouth rolls literally 
fall apart when you slam them 
down on the table. Just think, 
where else could you get such 
mouth watering combinations 
as bacon and liver, veal loaf and 
turkey gravy, fried scrod, or 
pineapple herkimer on toast. Another thing you never have to 
worry about is burning your 
tongue. The writers of this song 
would probably be happy to 
know that they can Find their 
fried crackerjacks simply by 
opening the stuffed peppers be
fore they wolf them down.
We do, however, realize that 
some of the complaints are valid, 
but the number of people who 
have complained of having their 
spoons sucked down into the 
bowl by the hot cereal is insigni
ficant compared to the countless 
thousands who have managed to 
enjoy this dish.
We sincerely hope that this 
letter does not strum the bod 
of the writers of the song, and 
if they really do not like the 
food at Skibo they can go eat 
somewhere else, like Stouffers.

, Housing Rates Up
Tech has decided, after careful study, 
that a modest but general increase in resi
dence hall rates is necessary effective Sep
tember 1962, Dean Brown stated recently.
All food and housing services at Tech 
are operated on a no-gain, no-loss basis, 
and the additional revenue resulting from 
(K the increase will allow Tech to maintain 
this tradition.
The new rise in Womens Dorm rates 
will make possible the modernization of 
Morewood Gardens, and the replacement 
of furnishings. It will also help to eliminate 
recent operating deficits, and to meet the 
increased operating costs in Morewood 
Gardens. The changes in rates are as fol
lows for the present Morewood Gardens, 
Towers A, B, C, and D: double room with
out bath, from $395 to $435; triple room 
without bath, from $395 to $435; suite 
with bath, from $407.50 to $445; single 
room without bath, from $407.50 to $445; 
double room with bath, from $420 to 
$465; single room with bath, from $420 
to $465. In the new addition to Morewood 
Gardens, the rates are as follows: double 
room without bath $435, single room
$
without bath, $445. These rates include 
both room and board per semester.
Mens Housing Rates
The change in the rates for all students 
living in Undergraduate Mens Residence 
Halls are as follows: single room without 
bath, from $170 to $200; double suite 
with bath from $175 to $205; double
suite without bath, from $160 to $195; 
double room with bath, from $145 to 
$190; triple suite without bath, from $135 
to $165; and triple suite without bath, 
from $135 to $165. Most of the rooms in 
Donner and Hammerschlag Halls are 
double rooms without baths; their rise in 
rates is from $145 to $190. Also, the new 
rate for a single room with bath is $215.
The school is currently preparing a 
program of accelerated maintenance and 
furniture replacement which will begin 
this summer and, because of the magni
tude of the task, will extend over several 
years. The program will enable the school 
to continue providing comfort and safe
ty for the student.

Tech Denies S'nS Chance to Be On TV
Probably the last chance for Carnegie 
Techs musical comedy club, Scotch n 
Soda, to gain back the national recognition 
it lost when the drama department issued 
its notorious 1948 ban on drama students 
participating in the Clubs productions was 
lost last Saturday week. A faculty and ad
ministration committee said No to 
Scotch n Sodas request to sign a contract 
permitting Shoot the Works to appear 
on a national TV program.
The Ward-Villani Productions, Inc. had 
offered to sink $18,000 into the filming 
and preparing of this years show to app
ear, along with the shows of 12 other col
leges, on a series of TV programs this 
summer. Techs portion of the time would 
have been one hour and would have cost 
the Club nothing. Little extra time would 
be required to complete the filming after 
the show was ready for the stage.
Now with this turn of events, Scotch 
n Soda, which used to be regarded among

The new system includes magnetic tape 
units that read and write at a rate of 
120,000 digits per second, and 600 lineper-minute printers. It uses the fastest

now available and is acceptable to any 
units developed in the future.

the top college productions in the country, 
will suffer a severe loss of prestige when 
the other college musicalsare shown to a 
national audience this summer. Much of 
the publicity, which Carnegie Tech 
normally works for so hard and spends a 
great sum, could have been gotten at no 
expense to the school.
When this years chairman of the board, 
Jerry Adker, requested consideration of his 
proposal by the college, President Warner 
hastily assembled a committee. This was 
particularly unfair to SnS since the club 
has no faculty adviser or coach, and it 
normally works so smoothly and silently 
that relatively few are aware of its presence 
until Spring Carnival, let alone the com
plexity of its functions.
It seems that the main reason advanced 
by this committee as an explanation for 
the negative answer was, Going into this 
wont cost us anything but our reputation. 
It can not be done without being 
misconstrued as a drama department

According to Scimitar and Cwens,

only 62 percent of the present freshman 
class succeeded in passing the CIT tradition 
exams given shortly before Homecom'ng.
Out of the 538 students eligible to take
the test, 333 passed, 42 failed, and 163 
neglected to show up at all. Appropriate 
action will be taken in these cases.

Pathetic Pulpy 
Puckering Plague
The problem of sloppy kissing is of 
growing magnitude on the Tech campus. 
Its cause, obviously, is the strange lips 
found on the faces of Morewood females. 
Tech men are forced to kiss tfie oddest, 
most impossible types conceivable. To cor
rect the problem, the kisser in question 
should learn to recognize the basic types 
and learn the method of attack best suited 
to each situation.
First of these is the athletic lips, the 
type that automatically pucker into a hard, 
doughnut-like ring. Depending on the girls 
shade of lipstick, these lips look like an 
orange, cherry, or grape Lifesaver. This 
same type sometimes holds her lips in such 
a tight, straight line you feel you are kiss
ing a crack in the sidewalk. To control 
this kind, ask the girl a question and, when 
she relaxes her lips to talk, kabong.
Then there is the girl who converses all 
during the kiss. Shes the one whose lips 
are as dry as the sphinx nose and who 
talks out of the side of her mouth while 
you try to hold a kiss like a famous screen 
lover. The remedy for this is very simple. 
Just hold her so tight she cant breathe. 
When a girl cant breathe, she cant talk.
Similar to the athletic girl are the 
comet type lips. The girl in this case usual
ly closes her eyes, thrusts her neck for
ward, and remains motionless, waiting in' 
anticipation. She is obviously an amateur 
and therefore a greedy kisser since she has 
no technique and from experience knows 
there will be no encore.
Be careful just before you kiss this type 
that you dont consciously shape your lips 
the same way or youll be so far apart that 
it would work better to write. The way to 
work this type is to tell her something fun
ny after she gets all set. Then, when she 
starts to smile, do your stuff.
The laststudy is the girl who has 
recently applied a thick coating of lipstick, 
and here you must look out for skidding. 
This kiss should not be hurried, but made 
with deliberation because if you rush it 
you may slip off her lips and swallow her 
earring. To swallow an earring is not so bad 
unless she is wearing long drops. You will 
find this variety to be most indigestible. 
When kissing this type it is-most important 
to approach the target from the perpendi
cular and execute with slow precision and 
careful aim.

SC "Gets Tough" 
With Frosh
Student Council has adopted a gettough policy with freshmen who didnt 
pass their traditions exams. Nearly 40% of 
the 538 students eligible to take the test 
either flunked it or failed to show up on 
either of the two occasions it was given.
Council, therefore, has decided to take 
the following action against these students. 
All campus organizations will be requested 
to submit a list of their members to the 
Student Council. Council will then exa
mine the list and report to the heads of 
the various activities any of the members 
who did not pass the tradition exams.
The various organizations will be expec
ted to drop those students who had not 
passed the exam. Any organization under 
the direct jurisdiction of Student Council 
which does not comply with this ruling 
within two weeks after notification will 
have its budget appropriation withheld by 
Council.
Fred Tonge was appointed chairman of 
a committee which will give further exams 
to students who wish to take it again
