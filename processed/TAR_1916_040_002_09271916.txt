LINEUP \Z ALMOST CERTAINWEATHER DELAYS PROGRAM
The Full Festival, with which school 
lifo at Tech is always opened, was 
varied this year by the addition to the 
usual Indian Play, of a Prologue en
titled, Prometheus, the Fire Bringor, 
created under the direction o Mr, 
Thomas Wood Stevens, ol! tho Depart
ment of Drama.
Delayed by cold and rainy weather 
during the opening wo ole, tho play was 
presented on Monday, Soptombor 25.

The Tech squad has just completed 
a very strenuous week on the home 
-field. Coach Steffen drilled the men in 
every branch of the game, running 
hack punts, blocking kicks, teaching 
the line men to charge, practicing all 
kinds of. kicks, and signal practice as\ 
well as sprimmage.
Most, pf the men are in excellent 
.shape with the exception of Gibson, 
Young and Wilford, the letter having 
trouble with some sore muscles in his 
Track. Nig Finley had a twisted 
ankle that bothered him for a short 
time, but is fast rounding into shape 
and should be in excellent condition 
by the time of our first game with 
Tale.
One of the outstanding features of 
every rehearsal is the unusual amount 
of pep shown by the new men. They 
are running tlie old men a very close 
second in this respect, and the entire 
squad is playing with a vim and zest 
that bids fair to overshadow last years 
great performance.

STARS COACH THECOMPETITION TO BE KEENWe wish to announce that due to our greater circulation 
this year, and larger number of subscriptions, we find it pos
sible to give the students a better paper. The first step in 
this direction has been taken,, we have secured the services 
of Mr. M. A. Zeller, who is the best student photographer at 
Tech, as staff photographer.
Photos of the Yale game will appear in our next issue as 
well as a special story of the game written by our represen
tative. We shall have cuts of student activities in as many 
issues as possible. Our present issue is evidence of this policy. 
The more subscriptions we secure the better Tho Tartan will 
be. You still have time to subscribe.
A groat innovation has boon planned 
at New Haven for the oponlng of Its 
football soason Saturday. Yalo has 
gone back to the first principles of 
the game, and tho team, captained by 
Cupid Black, looks like tho toams 
of old, lod by "Bum" McClung, George 
Chadwick or Tom Shovlln. Undoubt
edly Carnoglo Tech will face a simple, 
straight attack, blit It will bo carried 
on with groat speed and precision. 
The coaching stall!, hoaded by "Tad 
Jones, has boon seriously handlcappod 
by the absence of sovoral of tho best 
"prospects," who woro serving In tho 
Yalo battalion of tho National Guard. 
These mon returned tho latter part of 
last woolc and will catch up with tho 
gamo this woolc, as they have kept In 
good physical condition during their 
camping days.
The followers of Old Ell expect a 
great deal of Harry Lo Gore, who has 
been reinstated after losing one year 
of college athletics on account of play
ing summer baseball. Some of the 
best critics prodict'a greater future for 
him than Coy. At any rate, he will be 
one of the leaders in YaleB first game, 
and throughout the rest of the season. 
In all the workouts, so far, he has 
starred at halfback.
The Blue will have a heavy line, 
with a wealth of end material, while 
the outlook for quarterback is not so 
bright. Jones has combed the squad 
in an attempt to develop latent ma
terial for the place, but so far no one 
has been exceptionally good. Six men 
have already been tried and possibly

No one can deny the fact that the 
dormitories are dreadfully over-crowd: 
ed and that the time for more adequate 
dormitories has surely come. The 
IPifth Avenue Dorm., which housed 
about thirty girls last year, now has 
i'orty. The two houses on Morewood 
avenue now have about fifty-five, also 
an increase of ten over last year. Be
sides this number, six girls have rooms 
at the home of Professor and. Mrs. 
IDavenport, on Amberson avenue, and 
liave to take their meals at the Morewood avenue dormitory. Of the sixtytwo - girls at the Morewood Dorms., 
only twenty are old girls, so the task 
of looking after the new girls is not 
a small one and everyone must help 
-and get acquainted as quickly as pos
sible.

During tho past woolc, tho C. I. T.

which will be a credit to tho school. 
A number of the old men have re

SCHOOL ELECTIONS!
siammmiiemBm^saemesmis 
This cut is unique in that it shows the Science faculty meeting held 
fate of the delinquents. Our staff photographer walked into the meetinj 
faculty was unaware of Its purpose. Dean Leete dodged aside, but we wll
In the editorial colums of the 
first issue of The Tartan we men
tioned a plan which we wish to 
presont in reference to school elec
tions.
Wo find that the great majority 
of the student body do not vote in
telligently in school elections for 
the reason that they are, as a rule, 
not sufficiently acquainted with 
the duties and responsibilities connoctod with the various offices, nor 
the purpoaoB of tho various organ
izations to which representatives 
are being elected, nor has tho studorit any opportunity to bocomo 
acquainted with tho nominoos or 
their qualifications. While inves
tigating this oondition and during 
conversation with tho Deans of 
the Schools, activo alumni and 
mombors of tho administration, wo 
havo discovered oasos whoro a 
Senior Class ProBidont has boon 
olootod, who had not a ohanoo of 
graduating; mombors havo boon 
olootod to tho Students  Aotivitios 
Board who did not know tho pur
poses of that body, etc. Every 
student knows that suoli cases aro 
numerous.
We wish to suggest the follow
ing plan to remedy this condition. 
In case of class elections a meet
ing should be held to name the 
nominees for the respective offices; 
a list of these nominations should 
then appear in the next issue of 
The Tartan, at which time an ar
ticle or editorial will appear con
taining information as to the re
sponsibilities connected with these 
offices. In case of such elections 
as the Student Activities Board, 
an article will appear containing 
information concerning the pur
poses of that organization and the 
responsibilities connected with the 
various offices in that organiza
tion. In case of nominations be
ingplaced on bulletin boards, the 
nominations should close at a cer
tain speoifiod time so that a com
plete list of the nominoos may ap 
pear in our next issue.
This plan, if carriod out, givos 
ovory student an opportunity to 
bocomo acquaintod with all tho 
necessary facts, as well as tho nom
inees themBolvos. Attompts at 
politics or railroading will also 
become more difficult.
In order to adopt this plan we 
would suggest that a resolution 
similar to the following be passed 
by every class and student organ
ization in the school.
Resolved, That a complete list
of the nominees for the regular 
elections of student organizations, 
such as the Student Activities 
Board, Board of Control of the 
Athletic Association, Class Elec
tions and Thistle Elections, shall 
be published in The Tartan previ
ous to the elections. The elec
tions shall not take place until one 
day after the appearance of the 
issue of The Tartan containing 
this list. The President of the 
Class shall be responsible for fur
nishing The Tartan with this list 
in due time. In case of a general 
school election, the President of 
the Senior Class shall be respon
sible for furnishing The Tartan 
with the complete list in due time.
This resolution should of course 
be made to read so as to include 
only the elections which are ap
propriate to the particular class.
As we go to press, the upper 
and middle classes in the Indus
tries School have already adopted 
this resolution. They are to be 
complimented upon being the first 
to recognize the merits of this 
step.
Every student in the school will 
have an opportunity to vote upon 
this question within the next few 
days. The plan has been approved 
by the Deans; Graduate Manager 
Gearhart; Dr. Esquerre; Mr. Hart
man; last years president of the 
Science Junior Class, Mr. Harry 
Madison; President of the Carne
gie Dormitories Association, L. S. 
Jacobson, and many others.
The benofits of a system which 
will tend to bring about more in
telligent voting on tho part of tho 
studonts are obvious. It means a 
bottor student government, a bet
tor organized Institution, a bigger 
Tooh.
Voto for this system of elec
tions. You aro tho one who will 
bo bonolltod!
THE FOOTBALL TEAM.
The team is now practically on 
the eve of the first game. The 
Yale game has given Tech the op
portunity of meeting a school of 
undoubted reputation. In 'fact, 
the Yale game means a great deal, 
It means that we have a chance to 
be recognized in the world of Ath
letics. Our success wont depend 
upon a victory. A defeat 
is expected, but not an over
whelming defeat. The opin
ion in the Bast is that 
Tech will put up a good fight. 
There is no doubt about that, 
either, in so far as the men who 
will faee Yale is concerned. They 
will do their duty, which is to do 
their best. But how about the 
men who might have been in the 
eleven to faee Yale? Can we say 
that they have done their duty?
There is a very popular feeling 
among the students that whenever 
a football man is ineligible, that 
he is a sort of a martyr, the fac 
ulty is pictured as being heartless 
and always on the lookout to rob 
the gridiron of its stars. This is 
an illusion, a misconccption, and 
the sooner it is cleared up the 
better. We find that in almost 
every case when an athlete is 
taken from the team it is due to 
his own neglect. The present; sit
uation is particularly the ease. 
This year finds men who might 
have laced Yale, upon whom the 
coach, the captain, and the school 
itself had relied, with from four 
to nine credits short of the rcqniremciifs. Can tho faculty be 
blamed? What would an institu
tion amount to which would lower 
its scholastic standard for the ath
lete? Yes, we know there are such 
schools, but by whom arc they 
respected?
And how about the men who arc
msuzmai a
last Friday morning to decide the 
room, took the picture, while the 
I get him some other time!
not even out for the squad? It is 
every mans duty while at Tech to 
do some good for his school. True, 
he is here to educate himself, but 
the man who looks only for his 
own good, who does nothing, but 
absorb information, who lives only 
in his own narrow sphere, when 
he might be doing some good for 
his school, is laying some real ob
stacles in his way for future suc
cess. In other words, lie is a 
dead one, and dead ones dont 
very often come to life.

So-Called Efficiency Which Breaks Man 
Down in Prime Really is Inefficiency
By DARWIN P. KINGSLEY 
President of the New York Life Insurance Company
The inefficiency of efficiency has proved both costly and 
brutal. Every system of efficienc3r of the future must consider 
human life first. If human life is to be jeopardized by haste, dont 
hurry. If human life is to be sacrificed by speeding up efficiency, 
be less efficient; if the human body is to be maimed or destined in 
order to secure speed and power, get along with less power. This 
doctrine'is not merely sentimental; it is more than a reflection of 
the woe and heartbreak that follow the cruel strokes of industiy 
and traffic.
Human life is the only thing in the world that has any value; 
-all other values are derived from serving this primary value. The 
asset of the average man, the only thing that stands between his 
family and perhaps future dependence on charity, is his earningpower. Some plan which capitalizes his future earning power, his 
physical strength, must be incorporated in the efficient industrial 
system of the future.
An enormous vitality gain has been achieved in the earlier 
stages of life. A much larger percentage reach maturity through 
improved mothods of sanitation, but the human machine begins to 
go to pioces at lifty-iivd. It is the result of the heavy strain in the 
United States, a product of our modern life. It is the outgrowth 
of the worst form of inefficiency, of an attempt to be efficient with
out properly counting the cost.
Think of tho value of lives snuffed out at fifty-five! Just when 
these lives have reached their maturity of power, when knowledge 
has become wisdom, whc judgment has becomo well balanced 
fifteen years pi! the choicest part of their lives snuffed out!
A man should be at his best up to seventy. If a man disappears 
at fifty-five lie is inefficient, no matter what he has done before that 
timeinefficient because he has thrown away the ripe fruit of all 
his life.
Its inefficiency, though the man and the system may' call it 
efficiency. , v>
Are you an athlete? No? Are 
you a musical club man ? No ? Per
haps you have ability to write, to 
put down what you see about the 
campus in words, to be on the 
alert to pick up news that will in
terest your fellow students. Then 
your place is on the editorial staff 
of The Tartan.
It may be that your mind runs 
along humorous channels and 
that everything you see lias a 
funny side. You may have an 
imagination, which, if put in black 
and white, would draw a laugh. 
Oftentimes when poling over 
your books you take a few minutes 
off to jot down a bit oC rythm 
which, if anyone knew who wrote 
it, might cause qj bit of righteous 
indignation. If that description 
fits you, you can be of good use to 
Puppet in helping its editors 
to keep up with cxcellene3r of the

CLASS SUPREMACY CONTEST IN WHICH SOPHOMORES WERE VICTORIOUS
SOPHMORES WIN FROM 
FIRST YEAR MEN
On Monday afternoon, the Sopho
mores did the usual thing by winning 
the class contests over the Plebes. 
However, the Plebes gave the Sophs 
a hard race and made every event in
teresting. The stands were well 
filled with spectators and their atten
tion was held in the contests from the 
first wrestling bout until the final 
wind-up of the tug-of-war. The band 
made their initial appearance, and, 
although not in uniform, made a very 
good showing. They played a number 
of snappy new pieces which were well ! 
received.

Sophs, 5; Plebes, 10.
The next event was the field hockey 
game, which proved the fastest and 
most exciting game of the afternoon. 
Although the Sophs started out with 
a rush, the Plebes stayed with them 
and the first half was almost over be
fore either side scored. Many fouls 
were called, as most of the men rather 
forgot themselves and played under 
the delusion that it was a free-for-all 
fight. Flying sticks and hard falls 
were numerous. Most of the players 
came out of the game a little the 
worse for wear. The game resulted 
in a tie, each team taking 5 points. 
This changed the score to Sophs, 10; 
Plebes, 15.
The barrel-tilting contest was the 
next feature and created much amuse
ment for the spectators. After a bit 
of fast fencing, Juergans, Soph, took 
two falls out of the Plebe man, there
by winning the event. In the middle
weight bout, the men evidently thought 
that the game was a long-distance box
ing match. After much pounding the 
Plebe took the deciding fall from Butts, 
the Sophomore tilter. Warner, Soph, 
won his bout handily, having not much 
difficulty in winning. Score, Soph, 20; 
Plebe, 20.
The Sophs had everything their own 
way in the medicine ball relay race, 
winning with one man to spare. This 
victory was partly due to the fact that 
the Sophs knew how to swing their 
runner when he took the turns' about 
the line. This event put the Sophs 
in first place, 30-20.
Four teams from each side were in 
the pick-a-back race. This consisted 
of one man carrying on his back an
other one about fifty yards. At the 
end of the fifty yards, the men changed 
places and ran back to the line. The 
Sophs took the first two places, net
ting them eight points against the 
Plebes one. Pappenbach attempted a 
bit of "Buffalo Bill stuff in trying to 
make a flying mount onto Mills back. 
A pretty spill resulted, however; and 
the next mount was taken more care
fully.
The obstacle race consisted of run
ning down the field and going over 
and through hurdles. The Sophs took 
the first and third places. This made 
their score 44 as against the Plebes 
24.
The last contest was the tug-of-war, 
with twenty-five men on a side. The 
Plebes pulled together well and at the 
end of the three minutes, the knot 
was a good ways on their side of the 
line. This made the final score, Sophs, 
44; Plebes, 34
A baseball game was to have been 
played, but as the field was needed 
for a rehearsal of the pageant, this 
was called off.
M. M. C. S. STUDENTS 
HEAR DEAN DREED
On Thursday morning, all the stu
dents of the Margaret Morrison Car

gain success. Her motto was: "Put It 
Thriugh.
Director Hammerschlag gave a short 
talk, in which he spoke of Mr. and 
Mrs. Carnegie and hoped that all the

A CORRECTION.
In our last issue we made a state

McCooke. He has, however, charge 
of the student loan fund, student em
ployment, and alumni work.

i After the usual greetings to a stu! dent gathering, the Dean called attenI tion to the unique position, among 
j schools of art, occupied by the School 
i of Applied Design, housing as it does 
S the five arts under one roof; and to 
the benefits accruing to the student 
j therefromespecially the broadening 
effect of intercourse with those enj gaged in other lines of work, 
i It was Mr. Bossanges first general 
j address to the student body in his cai pacity as dean and he endeavored to 
j make his position clear, as to Ills plan 
i of action. He expressed a very earnest 
I desire to be guide, philosopher and 
| friend to the individual student 
i which will -make school problems less 
terrifying to the uninitiated and more 
interesting to those who are already 
J engaged in serious work.
He advocates self-government 
through a student Senate, but advises 
a more thorough organization of that 
body to make it more representative, 
and suggests committees from each 
department to facilitate action on the 
various questions that may come up 
for consideration.
PLEBE ASSEMBLY.
j An assembly of the Plebes was 
i called Friday by the officers of the Stu| dent Government Association. The 
j president, Miss Erneal Prayne, exj plained the objects of the association 
; and tried to impress on each girl the 
! necessity of obeying all rules of that 
| organization. The Students Hand| book explains in detail all the rules

The custom of presenting to the stu

newed on registration days. It had 
been a custom in previous years to get

other it failed to put in an appearance 
last year. The publishing of this book 
was the idea of the Seannacliie So

were laid by that organization. How
ever, chief credit for the execution of 
these plans belongs to Graduate Man

TEAM GREATLY WEAKENED
THREE MEN INELIGIBLE
(Continued Prom Page One.)
The new men this year seem unuaually good, a such men as Wright, 
.Lyons, Grady, Rupp, Thomas and WI1- 
ford have reported, a well a many 
other who should develop greatly an 
the year progresses. Bruce Wright, a 
new man from Lakewood (O.) High 
School, BA playing an exceptionally 
good game. He 1 well versed In the 
end position, being a sure tackier, a 
good handler of forward passe, and 
get di>wn the field under kicks well. 
Besides these, he Is a 50 yard punter 
and should prove a valuable asset if 
"Salt" Altdorfer 2A out for a fjliort time. 
Lyons and Grady, two new men, look 
like two very good bets for the tackles, 
this year, as both have the requisite 
strength and both are good fighters. 
Wllford should prove a valuable un
derstudy to Captain Hlllstrom this 
year at center, as lie was playing line 
ball until he wrenched Ills back mus
cles. Rupp, Thomas and Kratt are 
showing up nicely In the backfield, 
although the trio seems a little green 
just now, they should prove great guns 
later on.
It seems almost a foregone conclu
sion that the center of the line will be 
taken care of by the three veterans of 
last years team, Captain Hlllstrom, at 
center, with Fletcher and Kelly at 
either side of the guard positions. 
Whltey is going better than ever 
this year and here is one position that 
Tech need have no fear of this year, 
as "Whitey can be relied upon to play 
the same steady, heady game at cen
ter that he has played for the last 
three years, both on the offensive and 
defensive. Fletcher and Kelly should 
prove towers of strength this year, as 
both are big and fast and are already 
playing a much better game than last 
year. The tackles will both probably 
be new comers this year, as McFeaters 
is ineligible for the Yale game because 
of low scholastic records. The same 
applies to "Shorty" Holsworth, an old 
letter man. Both these men have 
showed much promise on the gridiron 
and it is the hope of all that their 
scholastic difficulties will be fixed up 
In the near future so that they can 
help Tech out this year on the best 
schedule a plaid team ever had. Just 
now it looks as it' Lyons and Grady 
would play the tackles for the first 
few games, at least,' and they should 
do good work, If the stuff they have 
shown In practice Is to be any indica
tion whatsoever. At the ends of line 
we have Wright and Gigson, varsity 
men of last year. Gibbie has im
proved much since this time last year 
and will bo a groat help. He has boon 
out with a minor Injury during the 
training period, but is rounding Into 
form and should bo in good sliapo for 
Yale, as the coach is resting him as 
much us possible. Tech is lucky In 
having "Sunny" Keener back again 
litis year, and as usual ho has tlio 
quarterback job clnchod, "Sunny is 
going better than over this year, and 
in all probability tills looks to bo a 
banner yoar for him, for ho sooms to 
bo In excellent condition,
"Nig Flnloy Is at his old place, 
high!, halfback, and Is showing more 
of tlio old time pop and fighting spirit 
than over before. Hero Is a man that 
should be a tower of strength to tlio 
team, as lie has taken up Coach Stef
fen's system reninrkably well. At left 
half, wo are not quite so fortunate, as 
"Phil Marshall, one of last year's 
stars, will be out of the game for two 
weeks, as he is low in his scholastic 
standing. It seems a shame thatthis 
should be the case for it breaks up 
that winning combination of Ivesner, 
Finley, Marshall and Altdoefer, that 
famous quartet in the backfield. Brunwasser apd Rupp have been alternat
ing at Phil's old job and have been 
playing excellent ball, considering the 
position is new to both. They are both 
fullbacks. Brunwasser has been play
ing quite a good defensive, back, as 
well as tearing big holes in the line, 
and at present he sems to have the 
call over Rupp, as Brunie has had a 
years experience under Coach Stef
fens.
Altdoefer is back, heavier than ever, 
and that means that the fullback posi
tion will be in good hands. Salt is 
the same line plunger and kicker as he 
was last ypar. It is probable that 
Salt" will do the kicking again this 
year, although Wright and Kesner are 
also displaying fine form.

back. Van Nostrand led the team 
against Princeton and Harvard last 
fall and lie has enough leadership abil
ity to give him a claim on the job this 
fall. Robinson was the freshman quar
terback two years ago and promised 
to make the 'varsity last year, when 
he was compelled to quit the game be
cause of injuries. Ames was a 'var
sity third string player last season, 
while Potter was substitute quarter
back for last years freshman team. 
Smith, who is now the Yale field 
leader, has for the first time risen 
above the third eleven. Sam Duree 
who retired last season because of in
juries after filling the position for two 
weeks, lias returned from Tobyhanna, 
Pa., with the Yale Battery and has 
joined the squad.
Ex-President Tafts son is a prom
ising aspirant for tackle, while Braden, 
a former W. & J. star, is showing good 
form in his drop kicking. The scarcity 
of good substitute material is bother
ing the Yale coaches, there being but 
few linemen of merit outside of the 
'varsity ranks.
If coaching will produce a team, the 
Blue should have a good one this sea
son. Dr. Williams, of the University 
of Minnesota, vas picked by the Yale 
Athletic Association as the man to di
rect this seasons pigskin activities, 
but he could not be induced to accept 
the position. Tad Jones, who was 
finally chosen, has a great reputation, 
and assisted by such men as Dr. Ar
thur Brides, Mike Sweeney, Dr. W. 
j T.. Bull, Jack Cates, William Marting 
J and Nate Wheeler, should produce a 
j team which will have a splendid 
! cliance of capturing the honors this 
j fall. The New York Post $ays of the 
I Yale coaching staff: On paper, at
! least, this pigskin faculty gives every 
| evidence of strength. 
i Vale will meet the opening game of 
the season with a repertoire of only a 
lew plays'. Not more than a dozen 
: varieties will be sent against Tech, 
j which is reported at Yale to have been 
| at work much longer and to have a 
i well-drilled eleven.
The Tech squad Will arrive in New 
Haven some time next Friday and will 
I be able to get in a short practice be| fore the game Saturday. All the Eli

followers are anxious to see what the 
strange aggregation looks like and are 
very dubious about the outcome of 
the game. Some, considering the slow 
start Yale gets every year, predict a 
victory for Carnegie, while others 
claim a good showing for Tech, even 
if Yale is in trim.

The band has high hopes for a verysuccessful season. The new men 
who have joined the band this year 
represent some of the best musicians 
that have ever been seen or heard 
around Tech.
Two good concerts and a dance are 
being planned by the members of the 
band. There has been some talk of a 
possibility of the band going to Ithaca 
for the Cornell game, but nothing 
definite has been decided as yet.

of the goodness of Kitche-Manito, but 
their dance was abruptly ended by 
news of the approach of the Plebe 
tribes, who demanded a place in the 
Council.
Indignantly refusing to accord the 
new-comers a place at their fires, the 
Sophomore warriors gave battle to 
their foes. The fighting braves surged 
back and forth, attempting to annihi
late their enemies by cunning tricks 
and well-laid traps.
Aroused by the noise and smoke of 
battle, the Senior tribes broke in be
tween the warriors and commanded 
peace between them, ordered them all 
to their rightful places and to call the 
rest their brothers. The contending 
tribes perceived the wisdom of this 
council and buried the hatchet to 
mark the end of their antagonism.
Messrs. Stein, Viehman and McCon
nell assisted Mr. Stevens in the direc
tion of the plays, whose chief char
acters were, Prometheus, Norwood 
Engle; the High Priest, G. G. William
son; Zeus, C. Frederick Stein; Time, 
Howard Smith; Senior Chief, H. G. 
Madison; Soph. Chief, J. G. Todd; 
Plebe Chief, H. D. Bowers; the Run
ner, James Church.
The work of the Choral and Glee 
Clubs was directed by Messrs. Webber 
and Schtz, and that of the Band by 
Messrs. Sullivan and Andrews. The 
girls of M. M. C. S. and the decorators 
of the Design School deserve credit 
for the costumes of the Greek players.
