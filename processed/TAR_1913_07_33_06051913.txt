PENN STATE DUAL MEET 
MONDAY.
THE GERMAN VIEW OF OUR BUCHTEL POUNDED OUT OF 
EVENING COURSES. GAME.
BASE BALL TEAM AT HOME 
SATURDAY.
Tech Hopes to Make Good Showing.
Flushed with a splendid victory at 
Westminster Saturday, the Tech 
track men entered into training for 
the Penn State dual meet next Mon
day, determined to give the Blue and 
White runners the hardest stuggle 
they have had this year. Though a 
victory is not expected, Capt. Craw
fords team will more than make its 
presence felt. State, with eight men, 
easily won the Pitt Intercollegiate 
meet a couple of weeks ago. The 
results of Mondays dual event will, 
therefore, offer a comparison of Techs 
strength with that of the other
schools in this section.
State can boast of at least one in
tercollegiate star in Keyser, the two 
miler, who took fourth place in the 
collegiate games at Harvard Satur
day. Opposed to him will be Hazeltine, Techs crack distance runner, 
who has a record better than that 
made by Keyser in the Pitt meet.
This race should be one of the best
of the day. Crawford will have to 
face an exceptionally good hurdler in 
Hamnett. If Chuck was in the 
proper physical condition, he. would 
be able to defeat his opponent in the 
high hurdles. Maybe State will win 
the pole vault, but Wright says Maybee they wont. Murphy and Wright 
will take care of the jump and Clair 
will make Lamb exert himself in the 
weight events. Tech will have most 
trouble in the sprints against Piner, 
the husky colored athlete.
The team will leave Sunday noon 
and remain at Bellefonte over night. 
Any of the men who have examina
tions scheduled for Monday will be 
permitted to take them at some later 
time.
C. I. T. DEFEATS W. & J.
Last Thursday, on t he courts of 
The University Club, our tennis team 
easily defeated W. & J. 4 matches to 
I.
The home team showed consider
able improvement over their previous 
work and played aggressive tennis 
through the entire match. The play
ing of Savage for our team and Good
win for W. & J. featured the match.
Duff defeated his opponent Baggs 
in straight sets. The score of this 
match was close but Duff always con(Editorial Note.A recent investi
gation of educational institutions in 
America gives some very interesting 
information concerning the German 
point of view of our evening class 
instruction. Professor Trinks has 
translated the following:)
Some schools give in the evening 
courses progressive instructions which 
run through several years. The 
Pratt Institute in Brooklyn offers a 
three year evening course in Electri
cal Engineering. It teaches in the 
first year Electricity and Technical Ma
chinery; then Electro Mechanical De
sign. In accordance with the usual 
custom, evening instruction is offered 
only during the six winter months. 
Here it is Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday, from 7:30 to 9:30. Each 
semester costs $15 tuition. A very 
much frequented course of instruc
tion is that which treats of mechanics 
of materials. It lasts only one semes
ter and teaches more practical work 
in connection with testing machines 
than theoretical lectures and techni
cal mechanics.
Still farther goes, for instances, the 
Carnegie School in Pittsburgh, which 
offers besides the already mentioned 
short courses for draftsmen, machin
ists, tradesmen, etc., regular evening 
courses which lead to an engineering 
diploma. The student must thus 
work for five years five evenings 
per week, or for seven years three 
evenings per week. Each year is 
counted as two semesters of which one 
runs from early in October to the 
middle of January, and the other one 
from the middle of January to early 
in May; each extends over ten weeks, 
considering vacations. To these en
gineering courses only such men are 
admitted of whom the department 
head has gained, by personal inter
view, the impression that they are 
intellectually and physically suited 
for evening studies of so large an ex
tent. Entrance requirements are the 
completion of a high school course of 
good standing or an equivalent of 
practical knowledge and experience 
and in addition the passing of an en
trance examination. The first men
tioned requirement is therefore equal 
to that required by academies and 
universities. Notable is the other 
clause which concedes to practical 
experience just as high an educational 
value as to the high school education.

Varsity Comes from Behind8-5.
Starting off poorly, the Varsity 
took a brace against Buchtel on Sat
urday, May 31, and won an up hill 
game by a score of 8 to 5. The day 
was ideal, but only a small crowd 
of Abronites witnessed the game. 
The contest, as a whole, was featured 
by unusually poor playing, Carnegie 
having their session during the first 
three innings, and the Buchtel men 
finished the game.
Urquhart started the pitching but 
had an off day and was replac'd*by 
Hines in the .third inning after two 
men had reached first and nobody 
had been retired. Hines went in un
prepared and with a sore arm, but 
after his first inning was able to hold 
the home team runless. The team 
gained confidence and gave him fine 
support while in the field, and showed 
greater intelligence at the bat and on 
the bases, earning their victory.
Capt. Gearhart, as usual set the 
pace in fielding and his only error in 
twelve difficult chances was not costly. 
He also had three hits for a total of 
four bases in four times at bat. Kirk 
had his famous speed with him and 
rattled the Buchtelites by his baserunning. He was up at the bat five 
times and hit safely three times, re
ceiving free passage to first the other 
two trips. From this he stole four 
bases, scored four runs and was 
thrown out at home once when a bat 
on the base-line prevented his sliding. 
Kauffman played second base in 
Brines place and made good. He 
hit safely three times when hits were 
needed, and played his position well, 
he has a nice throw and is speedy.
Sidnell put up the best game for 
the home team and had his mates 
played behind him in the same man
ner would have won his game. Adams 
and Zimmerman were the worst of 
the team and the way our boys took 
advantage of their mistakes won the 
contest.
First Inning.
Hall opened by hitting a liner to 
Sidnell who threw him out. Kirk 
drew a base on balls and stole sec
ond. Zimmermans throw to catch 
him hit him on the hips and the ball 
bounced to middle field, the speed

by Gearhart who threw in plenty ofContinued on Page 6.

West Virginia Wesleyan Here.
Capt. Gearharts men will receive 
a loyal welcome home Saturday after
noon when they take the field against 
the strong West Virginia Wesleyan 
nine. The team has been absent for 
a month and during that time has 
played three games of which two were 
victories. Every player has been do
ing so well that it is difficult to name 
any particular star. The all-around 
work of Vail and Gearhart and the 
pitching of Hoerr are, however, 
worthy of special mention. The lat
ter is one of the best college pitchers 
in the state. He has lots of speed 
with a change of pace and a good as
sortment of curves that have caused 
many a batter to look foolish.
Tech will start down the home 
stretch Saturday with a long string 
of victories and few defeats to its 
credit.  The students should show 
their appreciation of the teams splen
did efforts by turning out in goodly 
numbers to witness the game which 
will begin promptly at 3 oclock.

and scored when Sidnell hit over 
Kirks head. Sidnell took third on 
the throw-in. Thomas was throwrn 
out at first by Kauffman. Adams hit 
a single, scoring Sidnell, but was 
thrown out, Urquhart to Gearhart to 
Kauffman when he tried to steal sec

Second Inning.
De Muth singled to right middle 
and went to third on Lains single 
to left, while Lain was safe at second 
on the throw to third. Moorhead and 
Gearhart both fanned and Urquhart 
was thrown out by Bruner. Grimm 
hit a hot one to Hall who threw over 
Moorheads head, allowing Grimm to 
land safely. Montes sacrificed, Moor
head tagging him out. Zimmerman 
advanced Grimm to third by sacri
ficing Gearhart to Moorhead. Yachee 
was beaten to first by Moorhead. No 
runs.
Third Inning.
Hall hit to left but was thrown out 
at second when Kirk hit to short, 
Kirk stole second base. Kauffman

AN APPRECIATION AND A 
PROMISE.
Two and one-half years ago, when 
The Tartan was still in its early 
period of development, when almost 
the entire board of editors had re
tired and things generally were in a 
bad condition, a new man became 
Editor-in-Chief. The difficulties and 
obstacles in his path were enormous, 
sometimes they must have seemed al
most insurmountable, yet he over
came them all and by his personal 
efforts and the work of those asso
ciated with him, The Tartan was 
put on a sound basis, and has become 
truly representative among college 
weeklies of this large and growing re
stitution.
Fearless in his statements, sincere 
in his convictions, above all, fair and 
just in all matters of disputesuch 
a man was the retiring Editor-inChief. His loss will be keenly felt 
by the Tartan Board and by the 
school; but his work will go on, for 
his policies were so fair and honest 
that the new Board can do no better 
than to follow the example set by 
him.
We do not face such tremendous 
difficulties that have been met in the 
past, but The Tartan must continue 
to keep pace with the growth of the 
institution. To this end the Board 
seeks the co-operation of the faculty 
and student-body of the four schools. 
With this co-operation we may hope to 
accomplish great results, without it, 
our efforts will be of little avail. In 
taking up the work, the new Board 
promises to maintain-the conservative 
policy of the retiring Board, to keep 
these columns entirely free from any 
taint of partiality or favoritism, and 
earnestly to strive to be as fair and 
equitable as humanly possible.
THE EVENING ENGINEERING 
SCHOOL.
Elsewhere in this issue will be 
found a translation from the German, 
which gives quite an interesting re
sume of the work at Pratt Institute 
and here at Carnegie Tech for night 
men. According to this article, our 
school is going too far along that line, 
and demanding more of the men en
rolled than is humanly possible. 
While it is true that only a few men 
finish the five-year course, a number 
of the others devoting their time to 
special lines after the first two or 
three years, yet the course should 
not be termed unsuccessful. If only 
a few men are able to finish, the bene
fit to them is surely worth the price 
paid for it, and the evening school is 
accomplishing its worthy object. The 
only graduate who has attained dis
tinction by membership in an Ameri
can society of engineers was a night 
man. His recent death cut short the 
promise of a famous career, yet what 
he had already done is good proof 
that the engineering school does help 
its night men.
CORRESPONDENCE
[The Editors of the Tartan are pleased 
at all times to receive communications 
from any member of the Faculty or stu
dent-body upon subjects of timely inter
est. Such articles as are deemed of suf
ficient interest will be published at the 
first opportunity. Anonymous communi
cations cannot be considered, but the 
names of correspondents will be withheld 
when so desired.]
CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
Some time ago the upper classmen 
decided that students who continue 
to eat in the hall or locker rooms of 
the Science building regardless of the 
repeated appeals and warnings that 
they eat in the commons be tossed 
in a blanket. This was a perfectly 
fair decision and was accordingly en
forced. At that same time a Junior 
who was not eating in the hall was 
tossed merely because a few students 
having a grudge against him had pushed 
him on into the blanket. Most of 
the students being excited and carried 
away by the fun of the occasion did 
not ask any whys or wherefores and 
tossed him also.
On Tuesday, May 27th, another 
Science Junior was similarly treated. 
Most of the students did not have 
any reason for punishing him and, 
when through, asked each other why 
he was tossed. There were just about 
three students that gave any reason 
at all. and that was on general prin
ciples.
I protest against such wild and ir
responsible behavior of a few students 
towards one of their own fellows, and 
hope that the student body, which is 
of the average age of 21, and not an 
aggregation of high school kids, will 
not let such things happen again. Do 
you realize what it means to a stu
dent to be condemned by his fellowstudents which tossing, ducking, or
anything similar, actually is. I do 
not mean to say that it should not be 
done under any circumstances. If 
some student deserves it let him get 
it. But do you think that five, ten, 
or even twenty individuals, have a 
right to judge another one, when they 
are not representatives of the student 
body. I do not think so.
I hope that any punishment in
flicted upon an undergraduate in the 
future will be done only with the ap
proval of the undergraduate body.
Yours respectfully,
D. Rose.
P. S.Some students like to see 
somebody tossed for the fun of it. I 
would advise these students to form 
a Tossers Club and do that to each 
other at least once a week.
LETTER FROM THE SEANNACHIE TO THE STU
DENT ACTIVITIES 
COMMITTEE.
To the Student Activities Committee:
Having heard considerable comment 
by members of the Junior Class of the 
Science School in regard to the appear
ance of Mr. E. R. McKees name as a 
member of the Thistle Board, the Seannachie Society deemed it their duty to 
make a complete investigation of the 
matter. The following seem to be the 
pertinent facts in the case:
The Editor-in-Chief of the Thistle 
felt that another man was needed from 
the Science School to attend to various 
duties. He accordingly asked the per
mission of the Thistle Board to appoint 
a man, which permission was granted 
by vote. He then appointed Mr. Mc
Kee, who we understand has done ex
cellent work on the Thistle, and is to 
be highly commended for the interest 
he has taken.
The objections to this procedure are 
that the representatives from the three 
other schools took it upon themselves 
to give the Editor-in-Chief power to 
appoint another representative from the 
Science School. Further, the man ap
pointed had been a candidate for elec
tion to the Thistle Board in the first 
place, and had been defeated, which fact 
shows clearly that he was not the choice 
of the Junior Science class. It would 
seem that the only proper way to have 
selected another representative from the 
Junior Science class would have been 
for the Editor-in-Chief to ask them 
to appoint such a man for themselves, 
either by election or otherwise.
The Seannachie Society therefore feels 
that there is danger of a bad prece
dent being established, and would re
spectfully recommend to the Students 
Activities Committee that some action 
be taken in the matter, disapproving of 
the mode of procedure of this years 
Thistle Board in selecting additional 
members themselves instead of request
ing the various classes to elect them, 
providing such additional members were 
necessary.
The Seannachie Society would re*' 
ommend that this matter be brought to 
the attention of the student body as a 
whole, by publication of this letter in 
the Tartan.
Respectfully, 
SEANNACHIE SOCIETY.

MEETING OF STUDENT ACTIVI
TIES COMMITTEE. 
(Student Board)
Meeting called to order by President 
Griswold.
Organizations present: Band; This
tle; Musical Clubs; Seannachie; Tartan.
Mr. George F. Sheers, Auditor of 
the Carnegie Institute, was present, hav
ing been asked by the Student Board 
to submit sample ledgers and order 
books; also to give a short talk on ac
counting. Mr. Sheers submitted sam
ples of inexpensive ledger and order 
books, after which he gave a short talk 
on accounting, as per attached sheet. 
Stated that he would be glad to assist
the Board in any way possible, and
volunteered to submit dummy sys
tem of accounting for each different 
organization for their guidance. Moved 
by Madison that dummy forms of ac
counting be submitted to the various 
organizations, with the demand that
each organization adopt such system as 
the Student Board may decide upon. 
Seconded and carried.
President Griswold called the atten
tion of the Board to three or four 
numbers of The Tiger, the student 
publication of Colorado College, in
which may be found interesting articles 
on High School Day, Rules in Re
gard to Eligibility, Honor System, 
and Constitution of the Associated Stu
dents of Colorado College. President 
suggested that these papers be turned 
over to the Secretary of the Student 
Board for file and future reference.
Discussion regarding High School 
Day, in which it was brought out that 
plans were not formulated in sufficient 
time to properly handle this affair, and 
recommendation made that efforts be 
made at once to make the event a great
er success next year. Suggested by 
Haaren that the Seannachie Society take 
care of this, inasmuch as the purpose 
of the Student Activities Committee is 
to take care of only those conditions 
which have to do with non-athletic ac
tivities. Moved by Kelcey, seconded by 
Clair, that the Seannachie Society be 
instructed to look after the matter of 
High School Day for next year. Car
ried.
Discussion regarding balance due the 
Tech Design Club. Moved by Haaren 
that this be paid. Seconded and car
ried.
Letter from the Tartan was read, 
regarding the amount which they are 
indebted to the Student Activities Fund, 
and in which they advise they would 
be glad to pay the interest on the ac
count from year to year until such a 
time when things are on a more sure 
financial footing. They also asked that 
the Treasurer of the Student Activities 
Fund furnish them with a statement of 
this account. This report was accepted.
Letter from the Seannachie Society 
was read, in regard to the procedure 
of appointing members of the Thistle 
Board, suggesting that the matter be 
looked into by the Student Board.
Moved by Boyle that some form of 
constitution be adopted for the Thistle 
Board and recommended by the Stu
dent Activities Committee. Seconded 
and carried.
Moved by Madison that the follow
ing be appointed as a committee to 
draw up a draft of constitution to be 
recommended to the Thistle: T. Fish,
L. R. Madison, Anna B. Lachman, F.
H. Haaren. Seconded and carried.
Discussion regarding Intercollegiate 
Committee for Social Service, who have 
asked the co-operation of the Student 
Activities Committee in their work. It 
was suggested that the Musical Clubs 
have helped them, and no doubt the 
Orchestra will also be glad to do so. 
Moved by Kelcey that the Intercollegiate 
Committee for Social Service approach 
the managers of the various organiza
tions for assistance in their work. Sec
onded by Haaren. Carried.
Discussion regarding bill of $12.00 for 
taking the Band to the picnic on May 
24th, 1913. Moved by Madison, seconded 
by Haaren, that this bill be paid. Car
ried.
Report of the Student Auditing Com
mittee was read, in which they advised 
that M. Stubnitz, of the School of Ap
plied Science had been appointed as a 
third member of the Auditing Commit
tee ; that the Band has presented a gen
eral statement of their affairs for the 
present school year; that the White Fri
ars have an Auditing Committee of 
their own, and that they will audit their 
own books, which would make the Audit 
by the Student Auditing Committee of 
no great value. They also enclosed 
list of the Margaret Morrison girls, 
and show the amounts which they have 
paid to the Activity Fund.
This report of the Student Auditing 
Committee was accepted by the Student 
Board, as being full and complete in
sofar as was in their power.
Application from the Musical Clubs 
for $150.00 was placed before the meet
ing.
This application was received too late 
to be acted upon by the Student Board, 
and it was suggested that same be 
passed on to the Faculty for action, and 
later taken up by this Board.
Editorial Note: The Student Activi
ties Committee consists of two boards, 
a faculty committee and a student com
mittee. Its purpose is to encourage and 
assist all worthy non-athletic activities, 
and to guard against any mismanage
ment of the same. The above article 
is an abstract from the minutes of a 
recent meeting of the student commit
tee, and shows the care and thorough
ness with which the problems of the 
various organizations are solved.
NEW TARTAN BOARD 
ELECTED.
At the meeting of the Tartan Board 
last Thursday, elections were held for 
the positions which will be vacant 
at the end of the year. The result 
was that W. H. Searight, 15, becomes 
News Editor, and Charles E. Gilson, 
14, Editor-in-Chief, The new Board 
will at once assume its duties.
He: Lets go town and have a

A VISIT FROM THE PERSIAN 
AMBASSADOR.
Last Thursday, the M. M. C. S. 
girls had an honor bestowed upon 
them, wrhich was appreciated to its 
fullest extent. His Excellency, Mirza 
Ali Kuli Kahu, the ambassador to the 
Cnited States from Persia, give us a 
talk which will not soon be forgotten.
His Excellency opened his address by 
saying that the female wing of hu
manity was surely beginning to ex
pand and to develop, and that now 
women were being made responsible 
for accomplishing great results by be
ing given opportunities.
His Excellency explained that the 
American idea of Persian women was 
often a very false one. He said, The 
Persian woman is not suppressed. 
Her dignity is not trampled upon. In 
Persia, the woman has been the ruler 
in the house and will continue to be 
so. The lady of the house decides 
everything. Her requests are always 
granted, as she never asks what is 
wrong. She leads in things spiritual 
and practical. This school is the ex
pression of this ideal.
Our speaker then gave us a very 
interesting account of the recent revo
lution in Persia, of his own part in 
the affairs of the Persian government, 
of his appointment of Mr. Shuster, 
and of his work there.
We learned that for the last fifty 
years in Persia, there has been but 
one University for scientific studies. 
This is open to about four or five 
hundred young men whose fathers 
are connected with the government. 
(His Excellency is a graduate of this 
University.)
The last part of His Excellency ad
dress was about the Persian women. 
He ^aid that the veiling of women, 
brought in by Mohammed, was still 
in vogue, and was one of the greatest 
drawbacks. At the age of nine, the 
girl leaves school and goes home to 
take up embroidery and house work. 
The daughters of the privileged class 
are allowed a classical education, con
sisting of a study of Persian literature. 
The others have little or no education. 
Persian children, however, are taught 
implicit obedience to their parents. 
However, there are now corning to 
be more schools, and foreign lan
guages are being taught.
Persian marriages are very inter
esting. There are rare cases of poly
gamy, as many people here have been in
clined to believe. The parents choose 
the wife or the husband for their 
child. His Excellency explained that 
although this might not be practical 
in this country, yet it is an advantage 
there. There are matrimonial Gobetween wrho visit the girl and her 
parents, and carry back a report to 
the boys parents. If everything was 
favorable, the formal engagement was 
entered into by the giving of a ring 
and a cashmere shawl, sent by the 
boys parents to the girls parents. 
The bride and groom must never see 
each other until they are married. 
The bride furnishes the house, and 
long lines of mules can be seen 
carrying the furniture and about one 
or two-hundred suits of clothes for
the husbands relatives. The advan
tage in the young people not seeing 
each other lies in the fact that the 
young man has never seen any other 
women but those of his immediate 
family, and consequently thinks his 
wife the most beautiful, the most 
charming, the most talented woman 
that ever was born, and the !young 
lady has never seen any other men 
but those of her own family and con
sequently thinks her husband is, also, 
the most superlative.
Our Persian Ambassador, himself, 
broke over all the traditions of his 
fathers and married an American 
wife. His wife has done much for 
Persian women, in the way of starting 
schools, etc. By going among the 
women, when in Persia, and wearing 
their garb, she became a great favor
ite among them. She now represents 
the Persian women in America.
In closing, His Excellency spoke 
of the Universal Peace, in which he 
is so interested, and exhorted us to 
Spread Peace and demonstrate your 
ideals as units of a wonderful race.
It is a long time since the girls 
have enjoyed any talk like they did 
this one, and we only hope that some 
day we shall have the opportunity of 
hearing this wonderful mans wife.
M. M. C. S. AT CAMP LOUISE.
There is more than one M. M. C. S. 
girl who is looking forward with 
more than ordinary pleasure to the 
25th of June, when exams will be 
over, and she can hike for Camp 
Carnegie.
For two weeks the girls will be able 
to do exactly as they please, to swim, 
to paddle, to drive, to play, to eat, 
and to sleep.
Miss Stannard, with her inexhausti
ble supply of fun and good sense will 
chaperon the girls.. However, with 
all the fun they expect to have, yet 
those ideals for which the school 
stands, will not be neglected.
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL EN
GINEERING SOCIETY.
The fifth annual banquet of the C. 
M. E. S. will be held at the German 
Club on Craft avenue, Saturday, June 
7th. at 8 P. M. The speaker of the 
evening will be a member of the In
dustrial Improvement Commission 
and the subject selected is Progres
sive Pittsburgh. A very interesting 
talk is assured.
The welfare and progress of the so
ciety will be discussed and plans for 
the coming year are to be talked over. 
Application for a Student Branch of 
the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers has been made and admis
sion will probably be granted this 
j'ear. This fact will strengthen the 
society considerably and make it our 
duty to do our best for the society.
Officers are to elected for the com
ing year. The president and treas
urer are to be selected from the pres
ent Junior day students and Fourth 
year night students, while the vice 
president and the secretary are to be 
chosen from the Sophomore and

ZETA LAMBDA EPSILON 
OUTING.
On Saturday, May 31st, the Zeta 
Lambda Epsilon Fraternity held their 
annual outing on the Allegheny river 
above Oakmont. The afternoon was 
spent on the river, going from Oak
mont to Fourteen-Mile Island. Upon 
the arrival of the picnicers at the island 
dinner was served.
After dinner a large camp fire was 
built, around which the bunch gathered 
and singing and playing songs. The 
most enjoyable part of the evening was 
the trip back to Oakmont in the canoes, 
which were decorated with Japanese 
lanterns.
The guests of honor were Dean and 
Mrs. J. H. Leete, and Professor and 
Mrs. George H. Follows. Other guests 
of the fraternity were G. G. Kelcey, 
George Blair, Frank McCaughey, W. 
W. Lauer, J. R. Wilson and Ray Ful
mer.
CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING.
On Friday, May 23rd, the Crucible 
Club held the final meeting of the year. 
Mr. Ralston, of the Bureau of Mines, 
spoke to about fifty club members and 
many of the Plebes on Open Metal
lurgical Problems in Colorado. He 
told of the mountains of ore, for which 
no method of separation had yet been 
discovered. He also described several 
of the problems on which metallurgical 
engineers were now working. The talk 
was extremely interesting and furnished 
an excellent idea of the problems with 
which the students would have to con
tend after graduation.
The following officers for the en
suing year were elected :
PresidentF. H. Ernst.
Vice PresidentW. J. Corbett.
SecretaryH. D. Thomas.
TreasurerG. M. Douthett.
After the meeting the members re
paired to the club, where they enjoyed 
an excellent feed and smokes.

THE GERMAN VIEW

Continued from Page 1.
On the equivalent decides the de
partment head on the basis of testi
monials from employers and on the 
basis of the entrance examination. 
Students with high school education 
must be at least 18 years old; the 
others at least 19 years of age. The 
courses are intended for mature men 
with long practical experience. Those 
who already have sufficient technical 
knowledge can jump the first years 
no matter whether they have acquired 
such 'knowledge in the day courses of 
a technical school or by self instruc
tion. Such engineering evening 
courses are offered in (1) Technical 
Chemistry (split up into general tech
nical chemistry and electro chem
istry); (2) Civil Engineering; (3) 
Electro Engineering (4) Mechancial 
Engineering; (5) Metallurgy (split up 
into ferrous metallurgy, non-ferrous 
metallurgy, and electro metallurgy). 
The courses are similar to those of the 
day classes and the work in the lab
oratories takes up a large part of the 
curriculum. For instance does the 
curriculum of Electrical Engineer
ing show 650 class room and drawing 
room hours and approximately 550 
laboratory hours. It begins with Al
gebra. trigonometry, physics, chemis
try, mechanical drawing, and pro
gresses to the most difficult problems 
of alternating current which are 
treated analytically and graphically 
in the laboratory right along side of 
direct current.
Quite recently these Carnegie 
Schools in Pittsburgh have obtained 
from the Highest School Board of the 
State of Pennsylvania the right to 
grant these evening students, on the 
basis of corresponding examinations, 
the same degrees which the students 
of technical academies receive after 
completion of four years day instuction, namely, Miechanical Engineer, 
Civil Engineer, etc.
One may be a friend of the educa
tion of mature men and of evening 
courses, and one may fully appre
ciate their beneficial work, but this 
Pittsburgh method of evening instruc
tion apparently goes too far and is 
excessive. There are limits to what 
can be expected of body and brain 
tired out by the work of the day, and 
these limits cannot be extended by the 
energy and diligence of the student; 
and thus arises the great danger that 
the man only listens but does not 
retain anything and does not under
stand it.
THE MATTER OF THE THISTLE,
At the request of the Seannachie So
ciety, we are printing in this issue a 
copy of their letter to the Student Ac
tivities Committee. The letter clearly 
explains the whole matter. We cannot 
help but feel that there was danger of 
the establishment of a harmful prece
dent. We do not believe, however, that 
the Thistle Board or the Editor-in-Chief 
realized this when the appointment was 
made, and owing to a lack of definite
rules for the Thistles government, their 
action is not so much to be criticized 
for being undemocratic, as for being 
hasty and ill-considered. A committee 
has been appointed to draw up a con
stitution for future Thistle Boards,, so 
the matter will probably never come up 
again. Once more the Seannachie So
ciety has demonstrated its interest in 
the welfare of the student body as a 
whole.
RAIN PREVENTS MT. UNION 
GAME.
Just when the Varsity were about 
to hand the weather works a large boquet for giving fair skies on the days of 
this seasons games. Mr. J. Pluvius 
opened his fountains on Decoration 
Day. The team arrived in Alliance 
at 11 oclock on Friday morning, and 
had barely started to rubber-neck 
the city when the rain descended. 
Heavy showers followed in quick suc
cession until after one oclock and 
so drenched the playing field that the 
Mt. LTnion manager called the game 
off.
Captain Gearhart with one of his 
party, left the hotel with the obstensible object of looking at the field, 
but both men dropped by the way
side. When they returned, there were 
wafted wdth them vague rumor of a 
call on some fair Mt. Union co-eds 
with an accompaniment of lessons in 
fudge-making. A tale was told of one 
of the two adventurers being seen 
chasing a divinity down the street 
with divinity covering the lower 
part of his physiognomy. Nothing 
could be proved by or on the doughty 
captain, who would only admit that 
he had had a good time.
The evening wras spent in Alliance, 
the Seniors employing the time by 
studying, the other players being en
tertained by Pete DeMuth while they 
rested for the morrows game.
Quite Literary.
The estimation of what constitutes a 
family literary differs.
Is the family literary?
Well, they have some books, replied 
Booker; a check book, a work book, and 
a dictionary for the baby to sit on.
The negro maid interpreted the word 
differently.
Colonel Brown seems to be quite lit
erary, remarked the visitor, glancing at 
the magazines on the floor.
Yas, maam, replied the ebony-faced 
girl, yas, maam, he sholey am literary. 
He jes natally littahs things all ovah this 
yer house.
An Apology
One of our Ohio regiments had a colonel 
who was very much in disfavor. A member 
remarked one day: Our coljned aint fit 
fit to carry nuts to a hog.    This comment 
reached the ears of the doughty commander, 
who sent for him, raid after giving him a 
severe tongue-lasliing wound up by order
ing that he, at next dress parade, apologize. 
At the proper time he marched to the front 
and saluted:
Comrades, said he, by an inadvertence
I made use of the expression that our colonel 
was not fit to carry nuts to a hog, but now 
after due deliberation I am glad to say 
that he is fit.

Got the Appointment
When Richard Olney was Secretary of 
State he frequently gave expression to the 
opinion that appointees to the consular 
service should speak the language of the 
countries to which they were respectively 
accredited.
It is said that when a certain breezy and 
enterprising Western politician, who was 
desirous of serving the Cleveland adminis
tration in the capacity of consul at one 
of the Chinese ports, presented his papers 
to Mr. Olney, the secretary remarked:
Are you aware, Mr. Blank, that I never 
recommend to the President the appoint
ment of a consul unless he speaks the lan
guage of the country to which he desires 
to go? I suppose you do not speak Chin
ese?
Whereupon the Westerner grinned broad
ly. If, Mr. Secretary, said he, you 
will ask me a question in Chinese I shall be 
happy to answer it.
He got the appointment.
Right to the Point
Im going over to comfort Mrs. Brown, 
said Mrs. Jackson to her daughter Mary. 
Mr. Brown hanged himself in their attic 
last night. '
O, mother, dont go! You know you 
always say the wrong thing.
Yes, Im going, Mary. Ill just talk 
about the weather. Thats a safe enough 
subject.
Mrs. Jackson went over on her visit of 
condolence. We have had rainy weather 
lately, havent we, Mrs. Brown? she said.

the student asked: Father Taylor, what

VARSITY OUTCLASSES OTHER 
COLLEGES.
Win Meet by Lead of 11 Points.
The Varsity won the intercollegiate 
meet held at New Wilmington on 
Saturday, May 31, by piling up 52 
points against their nearest competi
tors 41. Tech men played in every 
track event in which they were en
tered and were among the winners 
in three of the field events.
Geneva College took second place, 
Westminster third with 31 points and 
Grove City, the fourth competitor 
finished last with 11 points. The 
track was heavy but good marks were 
set in all of the events.
Eleven of the fourteen men taken 
on the Carnegie team placed in the 
contests, and seven of these captured 
first places. Captain Crawford led 
the Carnegie point winners with two 
firsts, but Wright also captured two 
firsts. He had to split up his points 
with other contestants who tied with 
him, and his points totaled 7. Hazeltine captured the mile and took second 
in the two-mile, annexing 8 points.
Quay, of Geneva, was the star 
point-winner of the meet, getting 
16*4 points. His team-mate, Patter
son, ran a close second, totaling 13 
points in four events.
Crawford ran both hurdle races in 
fine form and won in fast time. 
Hazeltine ran a fast mile and finished 
a close second to Simpson in the twomile run. The latter runner showed 
the rapid improvement that he has 
been making this season and ran a 
pretty race. Clair won the hammer 
throw by a good margin with a heave 
of 125 feet 4 inches. He had things 
his own way in the discus throw, but 
was disqualified in the finals for 
stepping out of the ring.
Wright broke the school record in 
the pole vault by clearing the bar at
11 feet. Patterson, of Geneva, tied 
with him for first place, and won the 
medal in the jump-off. In the highjump, Wright and Murphy tied with 
Cannon, of Westminster, at 5 feet 7^4 
inches. The bar was lowered and 
Cannon won the first place medal, 
while Murphy and Wright took sec
ond and third, respectively. This was 
but the third time that Wright had 
jumped in competition, and his abil
ity is remarkable.
In the broad jump, Patterson suf
fered from lack of experience and 
failed to place in the finals. For a 
novice, however, he was jumping 
well.
Marks finished second in a fast 
100-yard dash, and Wabrath and 
Poyntz took second and third, re
spectively, in a speedy half-mile. No 
team was entered in the relay race.

trolled the situation and played a 
much more aggressive game.
Beeken met more than his match 
in Goodwin, the winning in
straight sets. Goodwin, who is 
Quarterback and Captain of the foot
ball team, played excellent tennis. 
With a wonderful ability to get 
around the court and plenty of head 
work, he gave Beeken his first de
feat of the season.
Captain Douthett had some trouble 
getting started, but after the first set 
struck his gait and pulled away from 
his opponent Watt in fine form.
Savage was at his best and never 
gave Hamilton a look-in. His man 
never had a chance and did not take a 
single game.
In the double, Beeken and Savage 
made quick work of Hamilton and
Watt. Duff and Douthett, however, 
had a harder time with Baggs and 
Goodwin. Each team took a set, then 
the match was called in order that the 
W. & J. team might catch a train.
The score in detail:
Duff defeated Baggs, 8-6, 6-4. Bee
ken lost to Goodwin, 1-6, 3-6. Dou
thett defeated Watt, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. 
Savage defeated Hamilton, 6-0, 6-0. 
Duff and Douthett tied with Baggs 
and Goodwin, 7-5, 3-6. Beeken and 
Savage defeated Hamilton and Watt.

Far Down the Scale.
An affectionate bride once hit upon the 
original idea of expressing her husbands 
perfections in terms of chocolate-cake; 
when he was good he was chocolate cake 
three layers deepwhen he was very 
good he was four layers deep, and so 
on up the scale.
One day, however, says the Boston 
Journal, the system broke down.
The brides mother dropped in, and 
noticed that her daughter looked vexed 
at something.
How is John to-day? the mother 
asked, pretending not to notice the brides 
vexation. Chocolate-cake four layers 
deep?
No.
Three layers deep?
No.
Two?
No.
Then what is he?

eye on the peppermint jar, have I been

answered mother dubiously, recalling a

CARNEGIE CHORAL CLUB.
After much deliberation and much 
hard work, on the part of the Com
mittee on Names, the new musical 
club, composed of members from all 
four schools, has finally adopted the 
name of Carnegie Choral Club.
The club has been hard at work 
all winter under the leadership of 
Mr. McDowell, and now is prepared 
to make its first bow to the public at 
the lawn fete and later at Commence
ment.
Although the object of the club is 
the organization of a musical society, 
which may represent the institution 
at all suitable functions, still its mem
bers have also thought of social functions of their own. This was shown 
last Wednesday afternoon when the 
Club held a picnic in Panther Hollow. 
The only regret the members of the 
Club have concerning that event is 
that its leader was unable to be pres
ent. x
At the last regular meeting of the 
Club the following officers were 
elected for the year 1913-1914.
President, Mr. Tucker.
Secretary, Miss Mary Williams.
Librarian, Mr. Sanborne.
In closing the work of the past 
year, the Club must thank its leader, 
Mr. McDowell, for his patience with 
its mistakes and his wonderful en
thusiasm and love for its work. The 
Club also acknowledges the good 
work of its president, Mr. Frank 
Crawford.
