On Tuesday, Carnegie Mel
lon University became a stop on 
the presidential campaign trail 
as Senator and Democratic VicePresidential candidate John Ed
wards spoke in Wiegand Gym
nasium. Edwards held a town 
hall-style meeting, which focused
primarily on antiterrorism efforts 
and healthcare.
When John Kerry is President 
of the United States we will find 
these terrorists where they are, 
and we will crush them before 
they can harm the American peo
ple, Edwards said.
According to Edwards, Ameri
can focus should shift back to the 
perpetrators of September 11, re
ferring to the Taliban and Osama
bin Laden. Additionally, Edwards 
said that America has not taken 
the steps necessary to confront 
threats from the other countries 
in President Bushs Axis of Evil, 
Iran and North Korea.
Blaming President Bush for 
the mess in Iraq, Edwards com
mented, Im convinced tjaat the 
only two people in America who 
still believe no mistakes have been 
made in Iraq are George Bush and 
Dick Cheney.
Changes in domestic security 
are also necessary, said Edwards. 
If you ask [most Americans] 
What would you have done dif
ferently than what you had done 
on September 11 that would pre
pare you for a terrorist attack to
day?  most people have no idea 
what they would do differently. 
Thats a failure in presidential 
leadership.
Joining Edwards was Kristen 
Breitweiser, a Middletown, N.J., 
resident whose husband died in 
the World Trade Center. Breit
weiser, a driving force behind the 
creation of the 9/11 commission, 
said that early appeals to create 
the commission were ineffectual. 
What we received back [from the 
Bush administration] was noth
ing but a battle, she said.
Breitweiser, who has been part 
of Edwards traveling campaign, 
called for more effective leader
ship in response to the September
11 attacks. I have a five-year-old 
little girl who lost her dad to al 
Qaeda. I dont want to lose her 
one day if shes working in the 
city or on mass transportation, 
and she gets blown up as payback 
for Iraq..
Following the speeches, Ed
wards held a question and answer 
session in which he described
health care as a huge issue in 
the campaign. The same health
care that is available to your 
United States Senator [should] 
be made available to every single 
American, he said. Edwards ar
gued that drug company ads on 
television are completely out of 
control, and he called for drug 
companies to spend their money 
on research and development in
stead of on advertisements. Fur
thermore, he contended that the 
healthcare situation in general 
has gotten worse under President 
Bush. Weve not had a serious 
health care plan  that alone 
should disqualify him from being 
President of the United States.
Energy independence was an
other key issue Edwards men
tioned. We have a Vice President 
who left Halliburton to become 
Vice President, and we have a 
President with strong, deep eco
nomic ties to big oil companies.... 
What are the odds that George 
Bush and Dick Cheney are ever 
going to do anything to move this 
country toward energy indepen
dence? It will never happen.
In addressing the economy, 
Edwards focused on tax cuts and 
the recent outsourcing of jobs. 
George Bush is the first President 
in 75 years to not create jobs.... 
Without jobs available, [the] 
American dream is being crushed 
for so many people every day, he 
said.
Edwards closed the meeting 
by appealing to the women in 
the audience. I think it is abso
lutely morally wrong that we live 
in a country where women are 
still being paid 75, 76 cents to [a 
mans dollar].

The name Rasputin means

real name was Grigory Efimov

first portable calculator placed 
for sale by Texas Instruments, in 
1972, weighed 2.5 pounds and 
cost $150. Assuming Rudolph is 
in front, there are 40,320 ways 
to arrange the other eight rein
deer. No one knows where Mo
zart is buried.
Students preparing to dis
play such knowledge gathered 
outside Rangos Ballroom on 
Wednesday. At 3:30 pm, the 
doors opened and the students 
entered, slid into seats at tables, 
and took a 10-question fill-inthe-blank test with trademark 
blue bdilMtesO pens.
It takes light eight and a half 
minutes to travel from the Sun to 
the Earth, but the bdilMtesO po
tentials were given up to 10 min
utes to contemplate the answers 
to questions on topics such as 
movies, ancient texts, currency, 
and politics.
The questions were fair, said 
Social Decision Sciences sopho
more Alison Lauer, because 
they were the same caliber as 
[the ones] on the show. Con
testants handed in their pink or 
yellow test papers and were then 
told whether they passed.
Approximately 10 percent of 
students who took the pre-test 
moved on to the Round Two: a 
50-question exam, which was 
given later in Doherty Hall.
Rebecca Erbstein, a bdilMtesO 
team member, explained that the 
first 1000 people were guaran

of the time, we turn students 
away because we cant see ev

all of Wednesdays contestants 
were full-time undergraduates 
without a previous degree, and 
are eligible to compete for the 
eventual $100,000 grand prize.
Gererdo Laperal, an H&SS 
first-year, said that he would use 
the money to fly [his residence] 
floor to Vegas.
In contrast, Daron Colflesh, a 
sophomore chemical engineer
ing major, would designate her 
winnings to pay off loans. 
Math and economics first-year 
John Scarfutti, who was among 
those who met with success, 
noted that the first round had 
pretty easy questions. 
Sophomore computer science

grandmother, who got me into 
bdilMtesO when I was little. 
According to Tony Pandolfo, 
one of the judges, those who do 
not watch the game show face a 
disadvantage during tryouts be
cause they are not used to wait

Last Saturday, a group of stu
dents and faculty from Carnegie 
Mellon University volunteered to 
help flood victims repair their water-damaged homes in Etna, a bor
ough of Allegheny County on the 
north shore of the Allegheny Riv
er. It brought tears to my eyes. I 
never expected that people would 
come to help  people Ive never 
met, said Etna resident and flood 
victim Tom Sauers, as volunteers 
helped carry dozens of five-gallon 
buckets of dark, sludgy silt out of 
his basement.
Just over two weeks ago, the 
remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit 
Pittsburgh with 5.9 inches of rain 
in 24 hours. In Etna, the flooding 
came suddenly and with great 
speed. In two minutes the base
ment was full. I couldnt believe 
it, recalled Cherry Street resi
dent Wanda Bendin, whose first
floor also sustained considerable 
damage. Benin said that the water 
rushed down from the stream. A 
low railway bridge over the nearby 
Pine Creek is known to collect de
bris, and when the debris comes 
loose in heavy rain, the collected 
water surges forth.
In 1986, the same bridge, 
owned by CSX Corp. of Jackson
ville, Fla., caused another flood 
in Etna, which killed eight people 
and resulted in $20 millio^i in 
damages. Community efforts to 
persuade the company to raise 
the bridge yielded no results and 
were abandoned.
Despite the enormous scale of 
the damage, some at Carnegie 
Mellon are concerned that too 
few people seem to be aware of 
the devastation. Volunteer Jeff 
Polack, a sophomore mechanical 
engineering major, said, I didnt 
know, and I dont think my friends 
know, how bad the damage is.
Housefellow of New House and 
Coordinator for Student Development Shernell Smith organized 
the volunteer trip with the sup
port of Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy and University 
President Jared Cohon and in co
ordination with North Hills Com
munity Outreach. The group of 10 
volunteers from Carnegie Mellon 
worked with the Calvert Memo
rial Presbyterian Church of Etna, 
which has been transformed into 
a community relief center under 
the leadership of Rev. Cynthia I.
Jackson. The Church has been 
supporting more than 35 fami
lies living on in the neighborhood 
between Freeport Street and the 
Allegheny Valley Expressway, 
where flood waters destroyed 
furnaces, water heaters, automo
biles, furnishings, clothing, and 
innumerable and invaluable per
sonal effects.
With the financial contribu
tions she has received, Rev. Jack

A message from your Student Body President, Erik Michaels-Ober
Erik Michaels-Ober
As Student Body President, I feel cam
pus security is one of my top priorities. I 
believe that students must feel safe to be 
successful. Student Body Vice President 
Julie Beckenstein and I work very closely 
with University Police Chief Creig Doyle to 
improve security on campus.
This past week, the University Police 
Department released its annual Campus 
Security Report. This report contains sta
tistical data about crimes reported on and 
around campus over the past three years. 
The most commonly reported crime is 
theft, and two of the most commonly 
stolen items are bicycles and laptop com
puters.
To deter theft of these items, you can 
register them with the University Police. 
Registration also increases the likelihood 
that stolen belongings will be returned to
you if they are recovered.
Although violent crimes are uncom
mon, their effects can be dreadful. Several 
campus services exist to keep you safe, 
notably Shuttle, Escort, SafeWalk, and 
the Rape Aggression Defense program 
(RAD).
Shuttle is a daytime transportation ser
vice that will take you safely to or from 
campus. It operates along two routes: 
the Oakland route and the Pittsburgh 
Technology Center (PTC) route. 
The Oakland route stops at Cathedral 
Mansions, Fairfax Apartments, James 
Manor Apartments, London Terrace, 
Veronica Apartments, Neville Apartments, 
Saxony Apartments, Shady Oaks, and 
Webster Hall. This shuttle leaves from the 
Morewood Gardens turnaround on the 
quarterand three-quarter hour.
The PTC shuttle leaves on the hour and 
stops in front of Scaife Hall before going 
directly to the PTC.
The Escort Service picks up where the
shuttle leaves off, operating from 6:30 pm 
until 6 am. Escort vans stop for pick-up at 
seven locations, spread throughout cam
pus. They will drop you off safely at your 
onor off-campus residence, anywhere 
within one-and-one-half miles of campus. 
Before 2:30 am, Escort vans start their 
routes every half-hour on the hour and 
half-hour. After 2:30 am, students must 
call (412) 268-7433 (8-RIDE on campus) 
to request pickup.
SafeWalk is a student-run walking 
escort that operates nightly, from 11 pm 
to 3 am. To have two trained volunteers 
walk you home from any location on cam
pus, you can'call (412) 268-7233 (8-SAFE 
on campus).
Please take advantage of these free ser
vices and avoid walking home alone at 
night.
RAD is a comprehensive self-defense 
course for women. It includes tactical 
and technical training in awareness, pre
vention, avoidance, risk reduction, and
hands-on martial arts. For more infor
mation or to register for the course, you 
can call (412) 268-6232 (dial 8-6232 on 
campus).
Ensuring that our campus is well lit 
is an important component of campus 
safety. If there is a dark area on a campus 
path that you regularly travel at night, 
please contact me and I will work to get 
new lights installed there. If lights are not 
working, please report them to Facilities 
Management Services if they are outside 
or Housing Services if they are within 
residence halls.
Even with these security measures in 
place, I encourage you to always be aware 
of your surroundings, not to let your guard 
down, and to offer to accompany your 
friends when they are walking at night. 
Lets help keep each other safe.

I would like to use this space 
as a chance to apologize to our 
readers for an egregious error that 
occurred in last weeks issue. As 
you are probably aware, the third 
page of the paper was clearly a 
mistake. The page printed was 
not the final version of the page, 
but an earlier draft. As a result, 
the headlines that were published 
were dummy headlines, and the 
captions were not finished. I was 
acting as Editor-in-Chief during 
our chiefs leave for academic rea
sons; the responsibility and the 
blame are fully mine. I am sorry.
This was a simple mistake in 
production; we had a final ver
sion of that page that was never 
seen by our readers. These errors 
were not the result of malice or 
belligerence, but of incompe
tence, specifically on my behalf. In 
order to explain how this mistake 
happened, I would like to walk 
through our regular production 
process. I hope this makes the 
production of The Tartan easier to 
understand.
The Tartan begins its produc
tion cycle on Monday. Each section 
holds a meeting at the beginning 
of the week, where articles are 
assigned to writers. Our writers 
then spend the week writing their 
stories and getting interviews. By 
Friday, our writers have submit
ted their stories, and the editing 
process begins. In the meantime 
a staff of photographers and art
ists work to provide graphical 
content to accompany these sto
ries.
Once an article has been edited 
by the appropriate section edi
tor, the Editor-in-Chief reviews it. 
Two copy editors then review the 
article in sequence. These editors 
perform typographical checks and 
ensure that the articles follow a 
consistent style. After the copy 
editors have reviewed the article, 
it is sent to the layout staff.
The layout staff is responsible for 
taking the finished material and 
placing it on the page, one of the 
most difficult tasks in publishing 
a newspaper. Every article must 
be made to fit. The layout staff is 
assisted by the production staff, 
who determine which sections go 
on which pages and provide tem
plates for each page. Furthermore, 
production is responsible for plac
ing advertisements.
Once the layout staff has 
designed all the articles on a page, 
the page is sent back to the copy 
staff. They now check all elements 
of the page to make sure that they 
conform to the Tartans style. This 
page is referred to as seconds, 
denoting a second proof. 
After copy has made corrections, 
the page is sent back to the layout 
staff, where these corrections are 
made on the computer. This pro
cess is repeated with thirds and 
then finals. These are reviewed 
by the Editor-in-Chief, who makes 
any necessary changes. The page 
is then finished and is sent to the 
publisher.
Last week, seconds of the 
third page were published instead 
of finals. Due to problems with 
our computers, changes had been 
made on a local copy rather than 
on our server. When it came time 
to send the page, an incorrect copy 
was sent. It is the Editor-in-Chiefs 
job to guarantee that the right 
files are sent. I made a mistake.
Every week, dozens of peo
ple work to perform the steps I 
described above. Throw in a num
ber of people who work on the 
non-content aspect of The Tartan, 
and we have a very large orga
nization. My staffers work dili
gently every week to produce the 
best paper they can and perform 
a service to the community. We 
hold ourselves to an incredibly 
high standard. When we fail to 
meet this standard, we feel that 
we let down the community. I 
apologize.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 4, 2004
Libertarian candidates address students
by Lukasz Krzyzanowski
anMcfCtrndt
Candidates from the Libertari
an Party staged a campaign event 
at Carnegie Mellon last Sunday. 
Among the candidates present 
were Betsy Summers, running 
for the U.S. Senate, and David 
Posipanka, running for the 38th 
District of the State House of 
Representatives.
Due to Hurricane Jeanne, Mi
chael Badnarik, the Libertarian 
candidate for President, could 
not attend the event. His execu
tive assistant, Jon Airheart, spoke 
in his place.
Opening the evening was 
Libertarian ,rnnukytVg -trkyBdW 
dwrdC columnist Dimitri Vassilaros. Describing the Libertar
ian Party as one that promotes 
personal freedom and personal 
responsibility, he extolled the 
virtues of Libertarianism, fram
ing them in the following state
ment: You should be able to do
whatever you want to do so long 
as you dont hurt someone else or 
someone elses property.
The Libertarian Party, the 
third largest in the United States, 
advocates the retreat of the gov
ernment from bedrooms, bank 
accounts and boardrooms, ac
cording to Vassilaros.
David Posipanka opened his 
speech with a personal anecdote, 
then advocated tort reform. He 
pledged that if elected he would 
fight for an elimination of corpo
rate tax in Pennsylvania in order 
to help businesses and consum
ers.
Proclaiming that taxation is 
morally wrong, Posipanka made 
an analogy between robbery and 
taxation, pointing to the ineffi
ciency of government bureaucra
cy and citing that it consumes 82 
cents per dollar collected.
In a plank-by-plank analysis 
of his platform, Posipanka an
nounced his support for capitol 
punishment: Everyone in the 
Capitol ought to be punished!
For all those who have grown 
disillusioned with government 
policies, Posipanka said, [t]he 
Libertarian Party is your reset 
button.
Betsy Summers, the Libertar
ian candidate for Senate, ad
dressed the issue of Social Secu
rity. She cited a study by the Cato 
Institute, a Libertarian think 
tank, which found that private 
retirement funds had returns of
7.5 percent over the past twenty 
years while Social Securitys re
turn was merely 1.2 percent. 
Summers proposed that the gov
ernment end Social Security for 
those yet to enter the workforce 
and put the money paid in by 
current taxpayers into individual 
lifetime annuities.
Further advocating decreas
ing the size of government, she 
said that 25 percent to 75 per
cent of the cost of products was 
a result of government regula
tion that should be abolished, 
and the safety of goods should be 
checked by private entities such
as Underwriters Laboratories.
Equating the national draft to 
involuntary servitude, Summers 
pledged that if elected she would 
fight against its reinstatement, 
and she would also attempt to 
repeal the USA PATRIOT Act, 
which Libertarians view as an 
unconstitutional assault on civil 
liberties.
She went on to criticize Con
gress over the war in Iraq, which 
the Libertarian Party wants to 
end. The best way to make us 
safer is to put an end of meddling 
with foreign nations, Summers 
said.
Due to Badnariks absence, 
Airheart offered a short biogra
phy of the Libertarian candidate 
and answered questions regard
ing Badnariks platform.
Ending the event, Vassilaros 
asked, Do you accept the prin
ciple that its OK for the govern
ment to take money from you to 
give to me?
If the answer is no, then you 
should vote Libertarian, he said.
Attorney details Mumia 
Abu-Jamals murder trial
by Louisa Kinoshi
byBrit anMcfCtrndt
Robert R. Bryan, the lead at
torney for Mumia Abu-Jamal, 
described his client as the voice 
of the voiceless in his speech on 
Tuesday in the Adamson Wing 
of Baker Hall. Bryan spoke to 
CMU students and members of 
the Pittsburgh community on 
the details of Abu-Jamals case. 
The lecture was hosted by the 
Western Pennsylvania Commit
tee to Free Mumia Abu-Jamal, 
and it featured commentary 
by Philadelphia journalist Linn 
Washington, Sam Jordan from 
Amnesty International, and Pam 
Africa from the MOVE organiza
tion.
Abu-Jamal, a former mem
ber of the Black Panther Party, 
became president of the Phila
delphia Association of Black 
Journalists in the late 1970s. On 
December 9, 1981, Abu-Jamal 
was involved in a fatal gunfight 
involving his brother and police 
officer Daniel Faulkner, and was 
convicted of first-degree mur
der. He has been on death row 
since July 3,1982.
We as lawyers cannot win 
without the movement. It is 
about people power; people 
have to be aware of the case, 
said Bryan as he spoke about 
Abu-Jamals supposed mistrial. 
He claimed that people of color 
were purposely removed from 
the jury pool and that Mumia 
was not given the right to rep
resent himself and instead was 
removed from the courtroom. 
He claimed that the prosecution 
withheld important evidence
and that fraudulent evidence 
was brought into the case. Bryan 
then stated, I will not rest until 
the doors are open in Waynesburg and Mumia walks out a 
free person.
Linn Washington, a Philadel
phia journalist who has been 
following Abu-Jamals case for 
22 years, spoke about the role of 
the media. Mumia Abu-Jamal 
is guilty as hell and should have 
been executed 10 years ago, 
is the attitude of journalists in 
Philadelphia, claimed Washing
ton. He accused the mainstream 
media of not adequately cover
ing the case. Washington called 
the judicial system a system of 
seamless injustice where, he 
said, police, prosecutors and 
judges in Philly and elsewhere 
go for results, not justice.
Only an international politi
cal movement can free Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, said Sam Jordan, 
the former director of Amnesty 
Internationals program to abol
ish the death penalty.
Mumia is clearly the evi
dence and not the crime, Pam 
Africa stated.
Sister Barbara Finch, co-chair 
of the Pennsylvania Abolition
ists United Against the Death 
Penalty, said, We should ex
pand our awareness of what is 
pro-life  abortion, war, and 
the death penalty are connected 
and we should think of them holistically.
In a recording he prepared for 
the lecture, Abu-Jamal thanked 
the audience and organizers of 
the event.
The struggle for life, liberty 
and freedom must continue, he 
said.

Student government and the 
College Democrats sponsored the 
event, which was attended by ap
proximately 750 people, includ
ing numerous students.
Im a disabled student, and 
[healthcare] is one of my chief 
concerns once I leave school. 
Whats going to happen to my 
healthcare? I run up huge costs. 
For me personally ... he really 
spoke to that today, said Janet 
Jay, a sophomore with a triple 
major in professional writing, 
creative writing, and social and 
cultural history.
To oppose the event, a CMU
conservative group Right On 
organized a protest outside the 
rally, while some members at
tended the speech. We had no 
intention of disrupting the event, 
but we wanted to make it clear 
that not all college students are 
liberal clones, said Sean Conroy, 
a sophomore physics major and 
Right On member.
I was surprised at how few 
students attended the event; I 
walked out afterwards and saw 
typical CMU students oblivious 
to the fact the next potential Vice 
President of the United States had 
been giving a speech not 200 feet

energy, the one who, moves 
the game along and is really into

Other important factors are 
the age of the contestant and the 
location of the university.
bdilMtesO typically gleans stu
dents from regional schools and 
then tapes the show in a neutral 
location, said Jimmy McGuire, 
one of the two Clue Crew rep
resentatives running the event.
When asked whether a rapid 
10-question test could accu
rately expose the intelligence of 
a student, McGuire replied that 
bdilMtesO uses the best system 
in operation because the eclec
tic categories cater to the wellrounded individual.
Junior ECE major Shomari 
Smith agreed, saying that this 
way a certain major is not au
tomatically advantaged over 
another. About 15 percent of 
attempts answer seven or more 
questions correctly.
On Sunday, junior ECE major 
Elliott Fleming was selected to 
go on to the bdilMtesO College 
Championship. Im just happy 
to have the opportunity to rep
resent Carnegie Mellon in a na
tional event, Fleming said.

On Wednesday, Rebecca Walker 
spoke in McConomy Auditorium 
as the Gay Pride Month keynote 
speaker. The speech was the first 
event of many in celebration of 
Gay Pride Month at Carnegie Mel
lon University.
Walker, a graduate of Yale Uni
versity, founded the Third Wave

and Ms. pMVM[rBd and was named 
one of the 50 most influential 
American leaders under the age 
of 40 by -rvd magazine. She has 
also received the NOW Intrepid 
Award in addition to the Women 
Who Could Be President Award 
from the League of Women Vot
ers.
Walkers speech, titled Love 
that Defies Convention, ad
dressed issues of sexual orien
tation and race. Vijay Jesrani, a 
junior Policy & Management, Po
litical Science, and History & Pol
icy major and GLBT Issues intern, 
introduced Walker as someone 
who embodies Carnegie Mellons 
mission of diversity. Walker, who 
is of Jewish and African-American 
descent, stated that its always a 
pleasure to speak to people... who 
are not complete ... who want to 
grow.
Walker said that we in the 
GLBT community are uniquely 
positioned to make decisions. 
She then asked, What are we do
ing right? and answered by say
ing, We are successful because of 
the power of our love.
Walker also discussed her de
sire for people to tame their
minds ... [to] increase positive 
emotions like love, compassion, 
and patience.
The peace movement begins at 
home ... in the hearts and minds 
of all of us, she said. She en
couraged students to [collapse] 
the boundary between yourself 
and others, by spending 30 sec
onds of the day imagining what 
it would be like to love everyone 
in the world. Divisions exist pri
marily in our minds, she said.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy felt that [Walkers] style 
was very warm and embracing.... 
Her message of vision ... was very 
inspiring.
Elizabeth Kupin, a junior in 
the Bachelor of Science and Arts 
program, echoed Murphys praise 
of Walker: [Walkers] change of 
rhetoric was very interesting. Ku
pin said she was pleased to find 
Walkers speech more emotional 
and more personal than she had 
anticipated.
Walker made a point to tell 
the audience that she was inten
tionally not dwelling on current 
legislation associated with GLBT 
issues. Walker explained that she 
would rather have President Bush 
become a more loving and com
passionate person than have ten 
new laws for GLBT issues. How
ever, when questioned the audi
ence, she did briefly address her 
frustration with President George 
W. Bush. Walker condemned 
President Bush for ordering tanks 
instead of ordering more schools 
to be built in Iraq. In her speech, 
she described politics as a form 
of civil warfare, and expressed 
her concern over the upcoming 
election and the war in Iraq. In 
the battle for more gay and lesbi
an rights, she said, We are slowly 
but surely winning.
Walkers speech was sponsored 
by SoHo, ALLIES, AB Political

The SpaceShipOne capsule, which is piggybacked into the air using a second aircraft, 
White Knight, has performed two successful suborbital flights before todays mission.

Today, the frontiers of space travel 
might once again be shattered. This 
morning in the Mojave Desert of 
California, $10 million will rest upon 
whether one teams efforts and years 
of engineering can successfully launch 
a manned ship into space and return it 
safely back to earth. If not, Burt Rutan 
and his teams ship, SpaceShipOne, 
will return to the drawing boards, and 
23 other teams will rush to take their 
place.
Spread all over the globe, these 24 
teams have been racing since 1996 to 
win the Ansari X Prize, a competition 
modeled after the Orteig Prize. Based 
in St. Louis in 1919 and finally won in 
1927, its challenge was to fly non-stop 
between New York and Paris. Charles 
Lindbergh won instant fame and the 
$25,000 pot when he became the first 
to hop the pond. His flight paved the 
way for passenger travel and, along 
with other aviation challenges given 
between 1905 and 1935, led to todays 
multibillion dollar airline industry.
Todays prize, however, is much larg
er, and the stakes are potentially much 
higher than what was once considered 
the Mount Everest of flight achieve
ments. Now, $10 million will go to 
the first team who can privately fund, 
engineer, and launch a space ship that 
can carry three people the 62.5 miles 
(100 km) into the atmosphere where 
official space begins. Two flights must 
also succeed within two weeks in the 
same vehicle.
No governments are allowed to par
ticipate, and every team is focused on 
a low-cost approach. The end goal is 
to help design ships for the private 
passenger market, a suggestion that 
has made some companies back on 
Earth leap at the chance. The Virgin 
Group, for example, broke its silence 
and announced a partnership with 
SpaceShipOnes Mojave Aerospace 
Ventures, LLC, to make the newly-christened Virgin Galactic the first commer
cial space-faring vehicle, all for only
$200,000 a sub-orbital pop.
The development of space tourism 
is an astonishing prospect for every
one, said Nick Schurch of Carnegie 
Mellons physics department, offering 
people the chance to see our planet and 
the universe like never before. I cant 
imagine that anyone, from any society 
of culture, could remain unchanged by 
such an experience.
Each team competing for the X Prize 
is following a different approach toward 
the goal, but they hope to steer clear of 
the massive expenses that face space 
travel today. Many of the teams are still 
implementing vertical liftoff methods 
used for the past 30 years by NASA 
and other space agencies, but they are 
foregoing more costly rocket fuels to 
experiment instead with hybrid propul
sion such as HTPB/Hydrogen Peroxide 
or LOX/Methane engines. Even John 
Carmack, the creator of the famed PC 
Doom game series, has a team compet
ing for the X Prize; dubbed Armadillo 
Aerospace and based out of Mesquite, 
Texas, it was attempting both a verti
cal land takeoff and a vertical powered 
landing until a rocket failure on August 
7 put them out of the race.
However, it is Burt Rutans Mojave 
Aerospace Ventures, LLC, that has come 
the closest to achieving their goal  and 
today, they will come one step closer.
SpaceShipOnes first launch was a test 
run last June. Rutans efforts involved 
a two-stage operation: SpaceShipOne 
was piggybacked to 50,000 feet 
on the underside of a second ship, 
White Knight, where it afterwards 
detached and propelled itself to a height 
of 67 miles. The method proved success
ful, and pilot Mike Melvill celebrated 
by releasing a bag of M&Ms inside of 
his zero-g cockpit during sub-orbital 
flight.
Last Wednesday, SpaceShipOne flew 
again and today it will be ready to com
plete its second run in two weeks. If suc
cessful, the Mojave Aerospace team will 
proceed to the final goal of launching 
a three-person squad under the same 
timetable. Two flights later, Rutan and 
his team will become the next Charles 
Lindberghs.
Technology students reach out to 
community through computers
by Kevin Chang
Uils anMcc
A new community ser
vice program is helping stu
dents with technical skills 
give back to the community 
by providing free tech sup
port and computer consult
ing to local nonprofit orga
nizations.
The Student Technology 
Outreach Center (STOC), 
founded by junior com
puter science and econom
ics double major Zhi Qiao, 
aims to give students with 
technical skills a chance 
to do community service 
while helping local organi
zations. The objective is 
to help the community and 
provide a clearinghouse for 
people at CMU who like 
to help out, said David 
Housman, a senior busi
ness and Human-Computer 
Interaction double major 
who helped Qiao start the 
project.
The program is designed 
to meet the needs of clients 
who need fast, occasional 
support, rather than those 
who have larger issues or 
need permanent help. Say 
a nonprofit in the commu
nity needs to have some
thing done. Theyll call us, 
Ill send people to get it 
done, Housman said.
Compared to a lot of 
people [outside] of the 
CMU community, we have a 
lot of skills, said Housman. 
People at CMU could pro
vide a service to the community by doing what they 
like to do and are good at.
Housman stressed that 
the groups goal was to help 
nonprofit organizations 
with high-level tasks like 
the use of common soft
ware packages and making 
decisions about hardware 
purchases. Not everyone 
at CMU is on the guru 
side of the technical abil
ity scale, Housman said. 
[STOC projects] are not 
hardcore programming.
Despite its recent launch, 
several organizations have 
already approached the 
group for assistance. Over 
the summer, STOC pro
vided consulting to the 
Center for Creative Play 
and trained staff at the 
Crohns Colitis Foundation 
of America in the use of 
Microsoft Office products. 
Almost a dozen organiza
tions are now awaiting help 
from the group.
Throughout each part
nership, staff members at 
the nonprofits work with 
students, so that the work 
done remains sustainable 
after the students leave. 
When the projects end, 
the students and clients 
fill out evaluation forms 
that let STOC improve its 
processes for the future 
and provide information 
for professors writing refer
ences.
STOC grew out of 15-391 
Technology Consulting in 
the Community, a course 
taught every semester by 
computer science professor
Joe Mertz. In that course, 
students get three relative
ly large tech-help projects 
to work on over a semester. 
[The course] is a 15-week 
engagement, which is good 
for a heavyweight project, 
said Mertz.
However, Mertz and 
some students realized that 
the classs design was not 
designed for and could not 
handle smaller, more com
mon issues.  Our printer 
keeps breaking doesnt 
need a huge project, said 
Mertz.
According to Mertz, a few 
years ago the then-dean
A2T HTER
of the school of computer 
science, James Morris, had 
the idea of starting a renta-geek program after tir
ing of constant requests 
for people from his depart
ment to help with computer 
problems.
Not long after, a donor 
gave the School of Computer 
Science funds to start a stu
dent outreach project and 
Qiao approached Mertz

How things work: voting machines

In a democratic country like 
America, voting is a thoroughly 
ingrained part of our lives. We 
are exposed to the process of 
voting at a very young age, mak
ing such groundbreaking deci
sions as whether to play kickball 
or dodgeball with a simple show 
of hands. As young adults, vot
ing becomes much more impor
tant. In Novembers Presidential 
election, many students will be
Bridget Lewis/Art Staff
voting for the first time. It is 
therefore important to under
stand how votes are counted 
when you step behind the cur
tain on Election Day.
Across the country, 
Americans will be casting their 
votes in many different ways 
on November 2. Paper ballots 
are the simplest. In a paper bal
lot, voters simply mark a box 
or write in their candidate of 
choice and submit the ballot, 
folded, to an election officer 
who verifies the its authenticity 
and drops it in a ballot box.
One might regard paper bal
lots as a bit antediluvian for 
our times, but they still see 
use in many rural communi
ties as the primary method of 
voting. In fact, five counties in 
Pennsylvania alone still use the 
paper ballot in certain munici
palities, and even more districts 
use them for absentee voting. 
Nationally, however, only 1.6 
percent of registered voters used 
paper ballots as of 1999. Paper 
ballots have the advantage ofbeing completely auditable, 
but suffer from a slow tallying 
process that is prone to human 
error. There is also a danger of 
ballot stuffing.
The next evolution in voting 
technology is the mechanical 
lever system. First used in 1892, 
these systems reached their 
peak in the 1960s and are still 
in use today. Indeed, all poll
ing places in Allegheny County 
will make use of these machines 
for the upcoming presidential 
elections. Cleverly designed, 
they require no electricity and 
rely completely on their inter
nal mechanics. They are quite 
large, being the size of a large 
wardrobe. A voter walks up to 
the machine and pulls a large 
central lever. This lever both 
closes a curtain around the 
voter to maintain privacy and 
readies the machine to accept a 
vote. The voter is presented with 
a lever for each candidate or 
ticket. Voters can change their
own votes as many times as they 
want; and when theyve made 
their final decision they pull the 
central lever back to its original 
position, which registers their 
choices, resets the levers, and 
opens the privacy curtain.
Internally, when the central 
lever is reset, the voted-on can
didates lever advances a coun
ter. This counter essentially 
operates like the odometer of 
a car. Because of their relative 
internal simplicity, mechanical 
lever machines are difficult to 
rig because it is obvious when 
one candidates linkage rod is 
disconnected or connected to 
the wrong counter. They also 
have proved their reliability, 
with single machines serving 
districts for 20 years or more.
Unfortunately, because they 
leave no audit trail, they are 
prone to abuse by polling offi
cials who might place multiple 
votes outside of polling hours. 
Nevertheless, in 1999,18.5 per
cent of voters used this method 
of voting. Though the federal 
government has issued legisla
tion to phase out mechanical 
lever systems by 2006, they may 
see use beyond that time due to 
lack of federal funding.
The next two voting meth
ods, commonly known as punch 
card and optical scan technol
ogy, can be discussed together. 
Though the voters procedure in 
selecting a candidate for each is 
different  the former requires
the voter to punch a hole in 
a card and the latter requires 
one to pencil in a bubble  the 
votes are tallied in the same 
way. Ballots from each are 
run through a scanner similar 
to what ones SATs would be 
scored with, and the holes or 
pencil marks are recognized as 
votes for particular candidates. 
When the ballots pass under 
the scanner, something called 
a charge coupled device, or 
CCD, has sensitive light detec
tors that detect incoming pho
tons and turn them into an 
electronic signal. A penciled-in 
bubble for a particular candi
date, because it is darker than 
its surroundings, will have a 
greater emissivity and will emit 
more photons into the CCD. 
Similarly, a hole will be darker 
than its surrounding paper and 
create the same effect. The CCD 
detects this and signals to the 
scanner that it should count the 
appropriate vote.
But even with such timetested technologies as these, 
problems can still arise. In opti
cal scan systems, scanners may 
have trouble detecting votes 
if bubbles arent filled in ade
quately. Both systems also face 
the danger of overvoting, where 
more candidates are selected 
than what is directed, either by 
punching too many holes or fail
ing to erase a mark completely.

Mount St. Helens 
ready to explode
Mount St. Helens in Vancouver, 
Wash., was recently issued a 
Level 3 Volcano Alert by the U.S. 
Geographical Survey (USGS). 
After scientists discovered the 
movement of underground lava, 
Tom Pierson of the USGS said that 
an eruption could occur within 
24 hours. This alert was issued 
Saturday in response to a 50-min
ute-long harmonic tremor that 
occurred on Friday. Scientists

Merck recalls Vioxx 
due to health risks
The popular arthritis drug 
Vioxx was recalled by drug-maker 
Merck & Co. after clinical tests 
demonstrated that the medication 
increased the risks of heart attack 
and stroke. The information was 
discovered after a three-year clin
ical trial using Vioxx to treat colon 
polyps. The total market value of 
Merck fell significantly by $25 
billion, with the companys stock 
losing nearly 27 percent.

Tech students reach out to organizations
TECH, from page A6
about coming up with a program. 
So I said, I have some money, 
what are you doing this sum
mer?, recalled Mertz.
Qiao ended up starting STOC 
over the summer, and now heads 
a group of about 30 people. 
Volunteers are divided into three 
groups: Project Coordinators, 
Project Managers and regular 
staff. According to Qiao, anyone 
can join at any of the three lev
els: coordinators perform more 
administrative tasks, staff mem
bers do the technical work, and 
managers serve in between. 
Additionally, Mertz serves as the 
groups official advisor, working
with an advisory council of other 
staff members.
We got the word out this sum
mer through some contacts that 
Professor Mertz and Shernell 
Smith had in the community, 
and it has grown from there, 
said Qiao. We hope that by sheer 
word of mouth and demand, the 
people who really need us will 
find out about us.
Qiao and Mertz both expressed 
their desire to see STOC grow 
into a more robust organization 
in the future. What I had always 
hoped for STOC was to develop 
ourselves into an umbrella orga
nization of campus resources, 
like students, organizations, fac
ulty, and departments, so that the
community at large would have 
one place to go to look for tech 
outreach, Qiao said. He stressed 
that he wanted to work with 
other groups rather than take 
them over, and said: Outreach is 
always stronger when it is unified 
and organized.
The one quote I learned from 
a non-profit leader this summer 
that I like to use in describing 
what it is we do is: Its real easy 
to eat a banana, but if you dont 
know youre supposed to peel it 
first, it can get awfully messy,  
Qiao said.
Students interested in volun
teering and groups looking to 
partner with STOC can contact

The mechanics behind voting
VOTING, from page A6
A poorly designed punch card in 
Florida caused 19,000 voters to 
overvote in 2000 elections. If that 
were not enough, punch card sys
tems may face problems if the 
holes arent punched through 
completely  the issue which 
caused the infamous hanging 
chad debacle of 2000. Luckily, 
both optical and punch card bal
lots can be recounted by hand, 
and this usually settles the issue, 
but this takes time. These prob
lems, ironically, havent deterred 
the continued use of these 
machines, which have been in 
use since the late 1960s. In 1999 
these technologies held 61.7 per
cent of machine usage by voter.
The latest technology on the 
block is called direct recording 
electronic or DRE voting. DRE 
voting machines have a screen 
displaying the ballot, and voters 
use either touch screens, buttons, 
or a keyboard to select or type 
in a candidate. This technology 
offers the advantage of instant, 
100-percent-accurate counts, 
multi-language support, preven
tion of overvoting, and instant 
transmission of results to election 
centers. Just 9.1 percent of reg
istered voters in 1999 used DREtype voting systems.
These advantages, however, are 
dependent on the quality of the 
software present inside these sys
tems, and that has been the sub
ject of heated debate. Unlike the 
mechanical lever system, the DRE
cant be opened up and inspected 
to see if a malfunction or foul play 
has occurred. In a DRE, foul play 
could be buried in a thousands 
lines of code impossible to find. 
And whereas abuse in other voting 
machines is localized, a breach 
in the security of software run
ning on DREs nationwide could 
have devastating results, causing 
American citizens to lose all faith 
in the voting process. Measures 
have been taken to prevent this 
kind of thing from happening, 
which have been spearheaded by 
the verified voting initiative.
Proponents of verified voting 
seek some method of proof for 
the electronic tally of the DRE  
in most cases, a paper receipt the 
voter verifies and puts in a sepa
rate ballot. After all, how can one 
do a recount on digital number? 
They hope that their efforts will 
pay off for the 2004 presidential 
elections, but much work needs 
to be done to get at the level of 
trust that is needed to implement 
DREs nationwide.
All of these ways to vote may 
seem a bit overwhelming, but 
that may soon change. Our gov
ernment passed a bill in 2002 
known as the Help America Vote 
Act, which makes several impor
tant reforms in voting technology, 
including support for multiple 
languages and disabled voters, 
notifications of overvotes, the 
ability to make changes before 
casting a ballot, and a recountable paper record. Even though 
these changes are supposed to
take effect by 2006, we may see 
the persistence of older methods 
for some time to come. Because 
many students here at Carnegie 
Mellon will be using mechanical 
lever systems in this election, it 
may be worthwhile to look at 
more detailed instructions on 
their use. These can be found at

Ex astria scientia: Humankind 
must move beyond the cradle
Last Wednesday, mankind took anoth
er giant leap toward civilian space travel. 
SpaceShipOne flew to an altitude of near
ly 64 miles, by official estimates. This is 
well above the altitude of about 62 miles 
needed to qualify for the Ansari X Prize, 
a $10 million prize intended to advance 
private space travel the way that similar 
prizes advanced commercial aviation 
back in the days of Charles Lindbergh 
and Amelia Earhart. This flight flies in the 
face of those who claim that only govern
ments will have the resources necessary 
to put people into orbit, on the Moon, or 
perhaps one day on Mars. The pilot of 
SpaceShipOne, Mike Melvill, became, at 
age 63, the first man to earn his astronaut 
wings in a private spacecraft.
Already there are plans for even more 
people to go into space. To fulfill the re
quirements for the Ansari X Prize, the 
same craft must make another successful 
flight within two weeks of the first suc
cessful flight, no simple feat. In the first 
flight, the craft performed about 40 bar
rel rolls while climbing to altitude, some
thing both unexpected and undesired. 
Still, Burt Rutan, the ships designer, 
feels that they should have any remain
ing technical issues worked out by their 
second flight, happening today.
For those who lack the skill and train
ing to become a pilot, Richard Branson 
has another option. Founder of Virgin At
lantic Airways, Branson has always been 
pushing the commercial aviation enve
lope. He has now announced his intent to 
go beyond the Earth and to bring space 
tourism to those who have the money. 
Tentatively dubbed Virgin Galactic, this 
new business venture would use technol
ogy that Branson has licensed from Mo
have Aerospace Ventures, the company
behind SpaceShipOne.
Of course, there are already argu
ments on how to best bring space travel 
(especially low Earth orbit and subor
bital flights) to the masses. Jim Benson 
of SpaceDev, the group that designed the 
engine in SpaceShipOne, feels that while 
SpaceShipOne is acceptable for winning 
the Ansari X Prize, another configuration 
will be needed for affordable space trav
el. His vehicle would take off like a rocket 
and land like a plane, in some ways simi
lar to how the shuttle works now.
Governments around the world are 
also working to bring mankind to the 
stars. The Communist Chinese have sent 
a man into orbit and have a lunar program 
in the works, while the Bush administra
tion has announced plans to return to the 
Moon by 2020 and go to Mars no earlier 
(not later) than 2030. Although this is a 
step in the right direction, frankly, its a 
baby step. Private companies have the 
potential to make great strides faster than 
governments already having millions of 
other things to fund and prioritize.
But all these plans have a greater need 
behind them than to satisfy billionaires 
desire for a new thrill and governments 
desire for further superiority. Space trav
el has brought about many advances in 
science and technology, some great (bar 
code scanners and rotary blood pumps) 
and some not-so-great (space ice cream). 
A presence in space becomes more and 
more important as we grow to realize 
the threat presented to us by a rogue as
teroid. Most important and necessary of 
all, traveling to space is one of the finest 
expressions of the human will and spirit. 
It lets us look beyond earthly desires and 
explore the limits of the universe and our 
own human potential.
Social network sites detrimental 
to authentic human interaction
Spreading around campus faster than 
the latest Windows virus is the phenom
enon known as Thefacebook. Even if you 
havent seen it  or joined it  youd be 
hard pressed to find any undergraduate 
without friends who use the site.
Thefacebook is the latest meme in 
a series of social networking websites; 
you may also be familiar with the more 
famous Orkut, Friendster, or OkCupid. 
Other college-themed networking sites 
like ConnectU and CollegeFacebook try 
to play off of Thefacebooks success, but 
are much less popular, whose ranks boast 
over 2000 students at Carnegie Mellon 
alone, with many other schools having 
even more people.
The premise is simple: Users sign up 
and create profiles listing various per
sonal attributes. Be it favorite movies, 
favorite books, class schedules, purity 
tests, or relationship status, any element 
can be completely personalized or even 
left out entirely. Furthermore, each site 
allows users to list others as friends, 
creating large connected graphs big 
enough to make most computer science 
majors giddy.
At first, these friendships allow an 
intriguing opportunity to explore the 
theory of degrees of separation. Users 
revel in the ability to link themselves 
with others using a myriad of different 
relationships and to realize the number 
of friends of friends that they have.
Its all in the name of fun, though that 
fun comes with some hidden dangers. 
All too quickly, users begin to focus on 
quantity of friends rather than true qual
ity relationships; enlarging the almighty 
social network is psychological goal num
ber one.
Accruing the maximal number of
friends is a dangerous goal; it takes an 
already tenuous notion of friendship and 
does nothing but undermine it. Simply, 
these social networking websites dis
tort the whole point of having friends, 
encouraging numbers over any sort of 
emotional attachment.
Another danger of Thefacebook and its 
ilk is that they encourage fake personae 
and interactions. While most any user 
will admit that Thefacebook is not reality 
and that peoples profiles are not neces
sarily representative of their true selves, 
the fact that the site encourages a specific 
sort of behavior is harder to realize.
Thefacebook provides a much-needed 
central repository of information about 
people; being able to export ones entire 
social network into a cell phone is a 
great advance in technology. This vast 
wealth of information, though, requires 
an oft-neglected amount of trust; while 
all information is given up voluntarily, 
most users fail to realize how easy it is for 
others to venture closer and closer, even 
to the realm of stalking.
While stalking is a major problem in 
collegiate life today, it is safe to say that 
virtually nobody who uses any social 
networking site does so in order to stalk 
people; these sites create an incredibly 
useful, truly entertaining resource. Often 
enough, the results are magnificent; ask 
any of the countless people that have 
reconnected with old friends or found 
new relationships through these sites 
and the utility is obvious.
It is, however, the supreme responsibil
ity of any person who deals with avatars 
of other people to take the whole experi
ence with a grain of salt. True relation
ships are made of more than just entries 
on a website.

One man, one vote? Not always the case
and fuel, a constant debate within our 
community. As I see it, such a debate is 
blossoming before us, and I feel it will 
continue to grow until November 2. This 
type of dialogue is very important at a 
time such as this. In recent years, the 
apathy surrounding elections has been 
astounding. It is my hope that these 
events, along with many others planned 
by AB and other student organizations, 
will help drive Carnegie Mellon students 
to the polls on Election Day.
The phrase fair and balanced has 
been one that I have heard many times 
recently. Many have accused AB of being 
nothing but a group of radical liberals. I 
assure you this is not true. The Activities 
Board always strives to present a bal
anced set of opinions when choosing 
programming to bring to our campus, 
especially within our Lectures and 
Political Speakers committees. Since the 
summer, AB has been working to secure 
speakers from the political right to speak 
to our campus community, and when we

_____________________Kirk Higgins
We live in a time of unprecedented 
change in our history. What the United 
States needs now is a president who 
is willing to adapt to find solutions to 
new problems. The biggest problem for 
President George W. Bush is his reluc
tance to receive and respond to con
structive criticism. September 11 was 
the biggest foreign attack on U.S. soil 
in recent history, but pressuring Bush to 
get to the bottom of it was like kicking a 
mule. Bush initially opposed forming an 
independent bipartisan panel to investi
gate intelligence and security failures of 
9/11 attacks. This is a horrible response 
to a national tragedy, something neither 
LBJ nor FDR opposed when faced with 
the Kennedy assassination and the Pearl 
Harbor attack, respectively. After some 
cajoling from families of 9/11 victims,
Bush then tried to place a rigid timetable 
on the commission and to appoint a con
troversial Cold War figurehead  Henry 
Kissinger, U.S. secretary of state under 
Richard Nixon  as the chair of the 9/11 
Commission. Kissinger recused himself 
and was replaced by the Republican 
former governor of New Jersey, Thomas 
Kean. Ironically, Kean was just as criti
cal as fellow Democrats on the panel of 
the President. Kean scorned the White 
House for refusing for several months 
to cooperate fully with the panel and 
denying access to crucial presidential 
briefings and other documents from the 
panel. Despite complaints that the panel 
was experiencing unnecessary delays 
and that it was grossly underfunded, 
Bush denied requests for several months 
to extend the deadline for the panel to 
produce its final report.
The 9/11 Commission released a 900- 
page report detailing failures in airport 
security, intelligence gathering, technol
ogy, domestic policy, and management.
The commission refused to lay,blame on 
any particular party, concluding that the 
attacks were a failure of imagination. 
We should all be thankful for a commis
sion that went to the end of the Earth 
to make Americans safer. However, its 
disappointing that the whole thing was 
roadblocked from the start from our 
President.
Of course, Bushs reasons for trying 
to block the 9/11 Commission should 
be obvious now. The most damaging 
conclusion reached by the panel is the 
lack of evidence linking Iraq to the 9/11 
attacks. Former anti-terrorist advisor 
Richard Clarke criticized Bush for ignor
ing the threat of al Qaeda and focus
ing efforts to scapegoat Iraq for the 
9/11 attacks. Bushs lack of patience 
for the UN inspections or for the 9/11 
Commission leads me to believe his 
drive to fight terror is being tainted by 
ideologues in his administration.
See MISSTEPS, page A9
Over the past few weeks there has 
been a very large reaction within our 
campus community to the upcom
ing Michael Moore lecture. The sheer 
amount of space that was taken up 
in last weeks edition of The Tartan, 
along with the many e-mails that have 
recently landed in my inbox, are proof 
of this. Believe it or not, I think this is 
perfect. The decision of the Activities 
Board to bring Michael Moore to cam
pus was not due to the supposed slanted 
political views within my organization, 
but out of the hope that such an event 
would excite our campus community 
before the upcoming elections. As I see 
it, we have done just that. What better 
time could there possibly be to bring 
such a figure to our campus? Mr. Moore 
will certainly not speak to the political 
beliefs of every segment of the campus 
community, but this is by design. The 
aim of the Activities Board in bringing 
a controversial speaker to campus is 
to provide the catalyst that will ignite,
Haseeb Qureshi/Art Staff
do book such a speaker, I am sure it will 
incite controversy similar to that which 
we see currently.
I know that our decisions will not 
make everyone happy, but we stand by 
them. AB works very hard to bring pro
gramming to campus that our student 
body will enjoy. You have entrusted us 
with a good portion of your Student 
Activities Fee, and it is my hope that we 
are delivering quality entertainment in 
return. If you do not feel we are deliv
ering on this promise, I encourage you 
to join the Activities Board and bring 
your thoughts to the table  we are 
more than willing to listen and act in 
response. This will help us to make 
our organization stronger and to better 
represent the views of the student body.

There has been a signifi
cant amount of positive cov
erage given to groups who 
are working tirelessly to reg
ister voters. These individuals 
volunteer their time to make 
democracy more effective 
by getting as many people 
to participate in the politi
cal process as possible. Yet 
there is a dark counterpoint 
to these efforts that has not 
received as much attention 
but is every bit as important 
to the political landscape: a 
concerted effort to under
mine these efforts and pre
vent thousands of American 
citizens from voting.
Quite simply, the efforts 
of thousands of volunteers 
to register voters are being 
invalidated by a small group 
of powerful individuals who 
are canceling registrations 
and intimidating voters. A 
good example can be found 
in Ohio, where Republican 
Secretary of State Kenneth 
Blackwell is not accept
ing registrations printed on 
paper that is not 80-pound 
stock. If any other paper is 
used, the applicant is mailed 
a correct registration form. 
Yet many election officials 
have complained, fearing 
that this obscure-element of 
the law is being enforced for
the sole purpose of causing 
thousands of registrations 
to arrive after the deadline. 
It should be no surprise to 
anyone that the number of 
new Democratic registrations 
vastly outweighs the number 
of new Republican registra
tions and that the counties 
where this is being most 
strictly enforced contain poor 
minority neighborhoods.
There are other, more
indirect ways that voters are 
being disenfranchised. The 
gold standard of disenfran
chisement remains Florida, 
a state that denied over 1100 
voters the right to vote in 
2000 by wrongly identifying 
them as felons. Once again, 
it should be no surprise that 
these voters were mostly 
black. This time around, 
Florida is employing a whole 
slew of strategies to restrict
Bum Lee/Art Staff
the black vote. There remain 
significant fears that the felon 
list will once again inten
tionally contain incorrect 
information. Furthermore, a 
number of investigations into 
local Democratic organizers 
have made many worried.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 4, 2004A9
Kerry draws aces in high-stakes foreign policy debate
Alexander Meseguer
There was something subtly 
different about this election years 
Presidential debate. It wasnt just 
that the American public finally 
got to see the two candidates sans 
30-second ads, 527 organiza
tions, and spin (well, mostly).
As in the 2000 debates, the 
networks were at it again, 
throwing up camera shots of the 
two candidates. Viewers were 
able to see Bushs frowning and 
fluster, while Kerrys face was 
suffused with a cool discipline. 
It certainly seemed like the 
President was on the defensive 
for most of the night, striking 
back at Kerrys arguments with 
some awkward pauses, dead air, 
and stuttering.
When voters need to make 
decisions, they need straight
forward answers that we can 
understand. While Bush is 
famously capable of connecting 
on that level, his attempts to do 
so Thursday night were feeble 
and based mostly on emotional 
pleas. He repeated the phrase 
hard work in reference to his 
job 11 times throughout the 90- 
minute debate. Meanwhile, Kerry 
spelled out his intended policies 
more explicitly (although not in 
the level of detail I had hoped), 
and spoke more skillfully than 
the President.
While the debate revolved 
around Iraq and its significance 
to national security, there were 
some points where one wondered 
if Bushs thinking wasnt unin
tentionally revealed by speak
ing errors. Moderator Jim Lehrer, 
and the only television journalist 
I respect today, asked Bush:
What about Senator Kerrys 
point, the comparison he drew 
between the priorities of going
after Osama bin Laden and going 
after Saddam Hussein?
Bushs answer: Of course 
were after Saddam Hussein  I 
mean bin Laden. While it may 
not really reveal the Presidents 
actual beliefs, it certainly reflects 
the effectiveness Kerry had in 
derailing his train of thought.
Another high point in Kerrys 
verbal attacks was during his 
rebuttal on the question of bring
ing troops back from Iraq.
Now I believe theres a bet
ter way to do this. You know, 
the Presidents father did not go 
into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond 
Basra. And the reason he didnt 
is, he said  he wrote in his book
 because there was no viable
exit strategy. And he said our 
troops would be occupiers in a 
bitterly hostile land.
Kerrys supreme confidence, 
almost cockiness, gave him the 
ability to deliver lines like that 
one which seemed to drain Bushs 
arguments of' their forcefulness 
and fluster Bush greatly.
Confidence or not, exaggera
tions and factual errors found 
their way into the speeches of 
both candidates. At one point, 
Bush claimed there were 100,000 
trained security personnel in Iraq. 
The reality that even the White 
House admits is most of those 
have received only three weeks 
of police training, compared to 
the 12 weeks many U.S. police
departments require for basic 
academy training.
On the other side of the issue, 
Kerry attacked Bush on out
sourcing the job of capturing 
Osama bin Laden to Afghan 
warlords during bin Ladens infa
mous escape from Tora Bora. 
Kerrys claims that the U.S. mili
tary could capture him at will 
are exaggerated  while the U.S. 
had solid intelligence regard
ing his presence there, we didnt 
know exactly where he was.
The reality was that both can
didates portrayed certain facts 
dishonestly. Exaggerations and 
outright errors of fact could be 
found coming from behind both 
podiums. Television, as a political
Bum Lee/Art Staff
medium, gives the most advan
tage to those who stay calm, 
cool, and reflective throughout 
the event. In this case Senator 
Kerry has emerged as the clear 
victor. Perhaps the best thing to 
come out of this debate is that the 
American public has been given

Attempts to block legitimate 
votes profoundly unpatriotic
VOTES, from A8
who historically has registered vot
ers and assisted the elderly with 
absentee ballots, has come under 
investigation by local authorities.
The Republicans deny that there 
is a political motivation behind this 
investigation. Yet when they interro
gate over 50 black individuals who 
registered to vote with Thomas, the 
Republicans are sending a very clear 
message to the black community 
of Orlando: getting involved with 
this election will cause you to come 
under suspicion. As one interviewee 
put it, I felt threatened, embar
rassed, and like I was being accused 
of being a criminal. Others said that 
after being interviewed, they were 
afraid to vote.
Investigations like this are taking 
place across Florida and other swing 
states. These actions bring back 
memories of the Jim Crow era and 
the days in which preventing black 
people from voting was an openly 
acknowledged tool of Southern con
servatives. Republicans dont have 
a monopoly on these efforts, but 
they are significantly more likely 
to use them than their Democratic 
counterparts, who benefit from 
high voter turnout. Democrats usu
ally commit their own fraud by using 
questionable methods to get out the 
vote, such as distributing cigarettes 
to homeless people.
Every individual who believes in 
the democratic process should be 
outraged by these actions. There 
are no easy ways to stop those in 
power from exercising authority in 
arbitrary ways. Even once voters 
have registered, there are ways that 
minorities are prevented from actu
ally voting. In 2000, Florida required 
minority voters in many counties to 
produce three forms of identifica
tion instead of the one required 
by law. If voters were unable to meet 
this arbitrary requirement, they 
were not allowed to vote.
While these tactics are difficult 
to stop, there are a number of ways 
that this process could be improved 
and that the right to vote could be 
better protected. Many states offer 
same-day registration, where any 
voter can register to vote at a poll
ing booth immediately before poll
ing. This would make it significantly 
easier for people to vote as it would 
prevent election officials like those 
in Ohio from throwing out registra
tions when the voters arent looking. 
Other methods exist to protect the 
vote, but until we implement any 
of them, we must be consistently 
vigilant as to how our election offi
cials act.

Bushs missteps lowered Americas 
trustworthiness on the world stage
MISSTEPS, from A8 "
What has been the cost of waging a war on 
a country on false pretenses? Even aside from 
the deaths of U.S. soldiers and thousands of 
civilians, our credibility in the world and our 
ability to unite countries in the fight against ter
ror has been compromised. What reason would 
there be for any ally to trust and help us now if 
we needed to attack a hostile nation? Secretary 
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is tight-lipped on 
discussing the threat of Iran, a country with 
greater weapons facilities that was recently 
ranked number one in state-sponsored terror
ism. Despite Bushs labeling North Korea along 
with Iran and Iraq in the Axis of Evil, North 
Korea acquired nuclear capabilities under his 
watch. Losing sight of real threats is a disturb
ing trend of this administration.
Bush would have you believe Kerry is soft in 
bringing international criminals and terrorist 
sponsors to justice. They must be ignoring his 
record in the Senate. In late 1980s, Kerry worked 
with Republican Senator Hank Brown to expose 
and dismantle a Pakistani-based enterprise that 
was funding drug trafficking, money launder
ing, CIA-backed dictators, and Islamic terror
ists. Kerrys efforts to unravel terrorist activities 
often put him at odds with government officials 
from both political parties, many either crimi
nally complacent with the information or hesi
tant to enforce the laws for ideological foreign 
policy reasons. The CIA later confirmed that 
Osama bin Laden and his allies had accounts in 
the bank and were laying the foundation for the 
terrorist network found today.
Kerry was one of the biggest fighters in 
the Senate to fund the COPS program, which 
aimed to put 100,000 new police officers on the
streets. Several police and fire-fighting unions 
that endorsed Bush in 2000 are now supporting 
Kerry for his promise to increase funding and 
modernize training for first responders. Kerry 
has sponsored several anti-assault weapon bills 
and would have extended the deadline for the 
1994 Assault Weapons ban, which many police 
unions say was essential to fighting crime and 
domestic terror.
Kerrys ability to learn, comprehend, and 
adapt to the new threats is the essential char
acter difference he has with Bush. As a district 
attorney, he created a unit that investigated 
organized crime and revamped the office to 
expedite indictments and prosecutions of crimi
nals. Unlike President Bush, John Kerry would 
immediately accept all the resolutions suggest
ed by the 9/11 Commission, which include 
creating a central intelligence czar with White 
House access. He would finally start looking to 
secure all our borders and ports and to do more 
inspections of packages passing through them.
Several military generals who worked under 
Bush are endorsing Kerry enthusiastically due 
to Bushs effort to alienate allies and ignore 
advice of military generals who know whats 
happening on the ground. In the Senate, hes 
fought for veterans rights and benefits for 20 
years. Kerry will be more likely to maintain 
the size of the volunteer army by trying to pass 
a veterans bill of rights. These reasons alone 
leave no doubt in my mind John Kerry has the 
drive and experience to adapt the strategies 
and laws that will bring terrorists to justice and 
make Americans safer.

Womens soccer rises to 6-1-2 after weeks two matches
Tartan football beats previously undefeated Wesley Wolverines 24-10
Sophomore Megan Hughes attempts to steal the ball away from her two Washington University 
opponents on Sunday.

The Carnegie Mellon 
womens soccer team split 
its two matches this week, 
beating Penn State Altoona, 
but losing to sixth-ranked 
Washington University 
(Mo.). The loss to the Bears 
was Carnegie Mellons first 
of the season, and came in 
a hard fought University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
match up. The Tartans 
record is now 6-1-2.
On Wednesday, September 
29, Carnegie Mellon host
ed Penn State Altoona at 
Gesling Stadium, and routed 
them by a final score of 9-0. 
The Tartans took the early 
lead, as sophomore midfield
er Jillian Erickson netted her 
first goal of the season in 
the sixth minute. The play
was set up as junior forward 
Kristin Bevilacqua-Linns 
pass found junior forward 
Hallie Dumont at the right 
edge of the box. Dumont 
then crossed it to Erickson 
for the easy finish.
There was a noticeable let
down on the field after the 
first goal, and Tartans head 
coach Heather Kendra could 
be heard on the sidelines 
threatening to bring in the 
substitutes if the pace did 
not pick up.
Shortly thereafter, 
Carnegie Mellon scored its 
second goal, as a Lisa Pascoli 
corner found the foot of firstyear forward Kasey Stever, 
who tapped the ball into the 
back of the net in the 33rd 
minute.
Whatever Kendra told the 
team at halftime seemed to 
resonate with the players, as 
the floodgates opened in the
second half. In what at times 
looked more like an offen
sive clinic than an NCAA 
soccer match, the Tartans 
peppered Penn States fresh
man goalkeeper with 22 sec
ond half shots, scoring on 
seven of them. By the end 
of the game, the final shot 
count was 40-1 in favor of 
Carnegie Mellon.
Sophomore midfielder 
Ashley McMakin fed the 
ball to sophomore fullback 
Andrea Maresca for the third 
goal of the game, in the 48th 
minute. In the 55th minute, 
Erickson scored off of an 
assist from Bevilacqua-Linn, 
increasing the Tartan lead to 
four goals.
A minute later, junior 
forward Vanessa McClainDuer stole the ball from a 
Penn State defender and hit 
it into the back of the net 
for goal number five. In the
59th minute, Dumont stole 
the ball 35 yards out and 
scored a goal reminiscent 
of the Major League Soccer 
shootouts from the leagues 
inaugural season, as it took 
her about five seconds to run 
towards the goal untouched 
and score the sixth goal of 
the game.
Junior midfielder Nadya 
Yaghoubi added to the goal 
total in the 73rd minute, as 
her shot ricocheted of the 
top and left posts before 
going in. Before it was over, 
McMakin scored in the 81st 
minute, and Stever scored 
her second goal of the game 
in the 85th minute. Stevers 
two goals give her five on 
the year, which leads the 
team. Senior goalkeeper

The Carnegie Mellon University 
football team will head into its UAA 
Conference schedule on a high note 
after moving to 3-2 with a 24-10 
victory over the previously unde
feated Wesley Wolverines (3-1) 
of the ACFC. Despite the Tartans 
inability to handle the Wolverines 
two-pronged rushing attack of 63" 
senior tailback Ken Busch and 5'4" 
junior tailback Kevin Nelson, the 
Tartans three first-half intercep
tions and a slew of other Wolverine 
mistakes made sure the contest was 
never in doubt.
The games scoring was almost 
complete by halftime, with the 
Tartans holding a 21-10 lead despite 
being out-gained on offense by the 
Wolverines 212-196, including 105 
rushing yards from the Wolverines 
sneaky, quick-cutting Kevin Nelson. 
Wesley also had 35 yards in first half 
penalties, mosdy on holding calls.
The Tartans punted on their first 
possession but got the ball back 
six plays later when senior Adam 
Bowland hopped in front of a screen
from Wolverines sophomore quar
terback Chris Warrick, taking it thir
ty yards to the Wolverine one-yard 
line. First-year running back Colby 
Whitman followed up with a oneyard run that put the Tartans up 7- 
0. Wesley was undaunted however, 
following up with a 15-play, 77-yard 
drive featuring impressive runs by 
Busch and Nelson, and capped off 
with a 32-yard field goal by Chris 
Carlton.
Tartans senior quarterback Jarrod 
Highberger responded quickly, find
ing Colby Whitman in the flat for on 
a huge 35-yard completion, but only 
moments later found Wolverines 
cornerback Mario Harris for the 
Tartans only turnover. Warrick 
was not to be outdone, however, 
and immediately gave it back when 
sophomore defensive back Aaron 
Lewis chased down an underthrown 
ball, giving the Tartans possession 
at their own 39.
Carnegie Mellon was again forced 
to punt, but forced yet another turn
over, this time a credit to the quick 
hands of senior defensive back 
Adam Lovrovich. First-year fullback 
Travis Sivek, the Tartans most con
sistent offensive producer of the
day, then broke off a 27-yard run 
to the Wesley one-yard line, and 
put it into the end zone three 
plays later.
The Tartans then seemed to 
take control of the game, grind
ing out a defensive stop and put
ting together a 12-play, 79-yard 
touchdown drive, highlighted 
and completed when a fake field 
goal attempt found tight end Matt 
Dalta for a 15-yard touchdown 
pass. Before halftime, however,
Wesley strung together a long 
drive of their own, moving 78 
yards in 11 plays as Ken Busch 
gained their only touchdown on a 
nine-yard run.
After halftime the scoring 
ground to a halt, aided by inter
mittent rain that seemed to dis
rupt both offenses. CMUs Neil 
Stegall provided the only points 
with a 31-yard field goal, and the 
Wolverines never seriously threat
ened to score.
The Tartans have next week 
off, followed by the Homecoming 
game, which is also the opening 
game of their UAA schedule, onOctober 16 against the University The footba}1 8ame on Saturday ended in a victory for the Tartans after their strong defense against the 
of Chicago. Wesley College Wolverines.
Volleyball 
competes in 
round robin
by Erin Goldberger
TuurunMBn alitnu ernit
In the first round of the UAA 
Round Robin Volleyball Tournament 
on last Saturday and Sunday, the 
women Tartans came away with a 
third place finish, tying with Union 
College. Winning three games a piece, 
Washington University at St. Louis and 
New York University tied for first and 
Emory University and University of 
Rochester tied for second, winning two 
games each.
On day one of the tournament 
which was hosted by Carnegie Mellon, 
Carnegie Mellon lost to Washington 
in all three matches. Washington have 
been the reigning champions of this 
tournament since 1989 and is nation
ally ranked. When asked how it was to 
play such a highly ranked team, firstyear Kate Stepp said, We had an extra 
special focus on this particular game 
because of their reputation as such a 
strong group of girls.
On Sunday the women came back to 
defeat Case Western Reserve University 
in all three matches.
They then played Emory in a very 
close game where they played five 
matches before Emory defeated the 
Tartans 3-2. The third match was a 
particularly close one, with the teams 
staying within two points of eachother 
the entire game until CMU pulled away 
toward the end to defeat Emory. Firstyear Abbie Toney said, It was a good 
loss because they are also a top team. 
We also made it to a fifth match with 
them. The fifth match came down to a 
score of 15-13 for Emory.
The Carnegie Mellon University 
womens volleyball team recently found 
a spot in the top 25 in the American 
Volleyball Coaches Association poll for 
the first time during their season. The 
Tartans are currently ranked 25th with 
22 points.
Round two of the Round Robin will 
be October 16 and 17 at the University 
of Chicago, which will lead up to 
the 18th Annual UAA Championship 
Tournament, to be held at Emory on 
November 5 and 6.
Water polo makes splash
Club team water polo season begins
by Christian DAndrea
anMccCtrndt
The Carnegie Mellon Club 
Water Polo team started its sea
son last weekend by dropping 
three games at the Washington 
and Jefferson Invitational 
Tournament in Washington, Pa.
Faced with stiff competition, 
including two NCAA varsity 
squads, the Tartans played well, 
but came up short in the end, 
losing to Penn State Behrend (6- 
15), Washington and Jefferson 
(6-12), and Yale (7-14). Despite 
the outcome, team members 
were happy with how the club 
performed against the more 
experienced teams.
This is our second year in the 
Collegiate Water Polo Association 
(CWPA), so were a relatively 
young team. We finished second 
in our region last year, and were 
still improving. This tournament 
gave us the opportunity to put in 
a lot of the less experienced play
ers, which will give us greater 
depth in the long run, said team 
captain Daniel Sunday.
Many returning players also 
played key roles in the tourna
ment, including Jon Hurst, 
who split time in the net and 
in the field. The team also got 
strong performances offensive
ly and defensively from Jamie 
McDonald, Dave Rozner, Mike 
Miles, Jackie Feinstein, and Kori 
Shih. Carnegie Mellons water 
polo team is one of the few sports 
at the school that is co-ed, com
bining men and women to create 
the strongest squad.
We have a good balance of 
experienced and inexperienced 
players right now. Were at the 
point where most of the guys 
and girls who have just started 
playing one or two years ago are 
really contributing to the team. 
In particular, Sunday noted the 
play of goalkeeper Dan Bernier, 
who had never played water 
polo until two years ago. Hes 
been looking a lot better in prac
tice, and he played very well last 
weekend. We are a very good
defensive team.
The team begins conference 
play next weekend with a home 
tournament and is looking for
ward to the upcoming compe
tition in the University Center. 
They have increased their roster 
size each year in the CWPA, and 
now expect big contributions 
from their secondand thirdyear players who now have a full 
understanding of the game.
These players are complement
ed by first-years who have played 
through high school and will be 
counted on to provide valuable 
experience in the future.
Our main concern right now is 
getting everyone working togeth
er so that our offense can start 
clicking. Once that happens, I feel 
that we can be a very dangerous 
team. Were looking to improve 
on our sixth place finish at the 
Divisional Championships, said 
Sunday. Being a club sport has 
its benefits and drawbacks for us. 
On the plus side, practice sched
ules are more relaxed so we can 
focus on other important things 
outside of the pool. On the flip 
side, we only have three prac
tices per week in the pool, so its 
a little harder to get everyone on 
the same page in that respect.
The teams upcoming tourna
ment will include divisional foes 
Lycoming College, Bloomsfield 
University, and Penn State 
University. Also in their divi
sion this year are the club teams 
from Villanova, Lehigh, and 
the University on Pennsylvania. 
Though the season is nearly in 
full swing, the club encourages 
interested students to come out 
and be a part of the team.
Senior James McDonald, who 
has played on the team for four 
years said: Club Water Polo is a 
lot of fun. Its student-run, so its 
pretty relaxed. We have a tourna
ment next weekend if you want 
to come over to the University 
Center pool and see what its all 
about.
The Club water polo prac
tices are Monday, Tuesday, and 
Thursday nights starting at 9 
pm.
Mens soccer ends winning streak
by John Gross
byBrit anMccCtrndt
The past week for the Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team has been tough and disappoint
ing, with a loss against the Penn State Altoona 
Lions on Wednesday night, 0-1,- and a tie 
last Sunday against the Washington University 
(Mo.) Bears, 0-0.
Wednesday, the Tartans traveled to Altoona 
to find themselves up against the highestskilled team they have competed against all 
season. The first half passed with no goals 
scored for either team. In the 77th minute, Lion 
forward Bryan Pierzga scored against Tartan 
senior goalkeeper Dave Thomas, making it the 
game-winning goal of the night. The Tartans 
left Altoona 5-1, destroying any chance for an 
undefeated soccer season.
Tartan junior Dan Mastalski received the 
sole yellow card of the night in the 40th min
ute. Neither team was caught offside, proving 
that the Tartans improved from last weeks 
nine calls offside. The Tartans outshot the 
Lions 19-1. Ironically, the single shot attempt
ed by Lions all night won the game for the Penn 
State team.
Yesterday, the Tartans hosted the Bears, to find 
themselves dead tied against them. Both 45-min
ute halves passed intensely, with foul after foul, 
with no goal scored by either team. Following 
the halves, two 10-minute sudden-death over
time periods occurred, with still no goal scored 
by either team. Anger flared at two points in the 
game, when both senior forward James Steidel 
and midfielder Mastalski had a run-in with Bear 
midfielder Josh Farber. The referees let both inci
dents slide, with no foul or card given to any of 
the three players involved. The Tartans exit this 
game 5-1-1, and the Bears leave Tartan territory
7-2-1.
On Tuesday, Jonathan Browne was honored 
by the UAA as one of the Athletes of the Week. 
Brownes award was earned by his performance 
in the games against Point Park University and 
Oberlin College. The Tartans defeated both of 
those teams 6-0 and 2-1, respectively. Browne 
scored five of the eight total goals scored between 
these two games. Thus far this season, Browne 
has scored 11 goals, surpassing his cumulative 
record from the 2003 season and is currently the 
Division III leader in goals per game (2.2).
On Saturday the Carnegie Mellon soccer team 
will play away against the University of Chicago 
Maroons.
Sophomore forward Jonathan Browne, who was honord by the UAA as one of the Athletes of the Week, 
keeps the ball away from his opponents during the game against Washington University on Sunday.

Soccer team splits Wash U. and PSU Altoona games
SOCCER, page A10
Week due to her stellar play and 
back-to-back shutouts last week, 
was not tested once throughout 
the game.
Senior midfielder Amy Tsao 
was pleased with her teams sec
ond half performance, saying that 
we really picked up our game. 
Kendra agreed, Im happy 
with the final result, but I am not 
happy with our first half caliber 
of play. I was very pleased with 
the second half, though.
It was a great opportunity to 
work on our finishing, added
Steve r.
Yesterday, the Tartans hosted 
the Washington University (Mo.) 
Bears in their first conference 
game, and lost by a final score of 
1-0. It was a tight game through
out, and a very physical one, as 
both teams tried to start UAA 
play on a strong note. Both teams 
attacked well for all ninety min
utes, but stellar team defending 
and goalkeeping stymied many 
opportunities.
Washington University struck 
first in the 17th minute, as the 
ball bounced around in front of 
Carnegie Mellons goal before a
Bear forward could put it in. The 
Tartans picked up their attack 
for the rest of the half, includ
ing a great header on goal in 
the 30th minute that was saved 
by Washingtons goalkeeper. 
Carnegie Mellon went into halftime down 1-0.
In the 63rd minute, junior full
back Margaret Becks excellent 
ball-work along the sideline cre
ated a great scoring chance for 
the Tartans, but they were unable 
to finish. In the 69th minute, a 
Carnegie Mellon free kick from 
twenty yards out hit the post, 
but again the home squad was
unlucky. Monroe made an excel
lent save with less than seven 
minutes to play to keep her team 
in the game, but the game-tying 
goal was elusive, and the Tartans 
suffered their first loss of the sea
son.
We had lots of good chanc

Furious CD from lamb of god

 from Omerta off lamb of gods newest, Tugdu 
ic ngd 1MAd
When lamb of god plays the Rock Club this com
ing Friday, they will return to Pittsburgh as con
querors of their genre. In the struggle to return 
American Metal to its rightful place among the 
best that music has to offer, lamb are the leaders 
of the new breed. Imagine, if you will, prog rock at 
its best  yes, maybe even King Crimson or Pink 
Floyd. Music played at its highest level. Then add 
in fury. Not just hard rock, a la Rush, but pure fe
rocity in competition with precision. Slow grind
ing groove as you sink into a quicksand of riff 
after riff. As the guitars whirl above you, Randy 
Blythe growls in the foreground. Sirens go off in 
the background; machine-gun beats pummel you 
as you struggle to regain consciousness. Paranoia 
sets in, and you start swinging. At anything that 
moves. As fist hits bone, you understand  the 
cathartic effect of violence.
Only a set few bands can draw out the primal be
ing in me, and right now Im releasing that ag
gression thanks to l.o.g. Tugdu ic ngd 1MAd is the 
long awaited collection of new songs that lamb 
has been so kind as to unleash upon us. Fluid and 
coherent one minute, empty and bleak the next, 
the mix of atmospheres leads to a feeling of con
fusion and desolation. Somehow mixed in to this 
is th sense of needing to lash out. Blythe, backed 
by the brothers Adler and Company, implants this 
desire wonderfully with his vocal range. If youve 
seen them live before, or caught a glimpse of their 
DVD -dttit MBe qyktru you clearly get that sense 
as he stalks the stage from left to right, pacing, 
pacing.... Unable to draw your eyes away, want
ing to see if hell fall or mow us down in a hail of 
fire, lamb live is a spectacle to witness the rebirth 
of dangerous music.
With lamb recently signing to a major label in 
Epic records, dilution of their potent music would 
seem imminent. But Epic seems to have left well 
enough alone, and the result really does top the 
last two albums. Machine takes over the produc
tion duties here from Devin Townsend, who did 
a stellar job with As ngd ,MmMSdu Kyv... their last 
album. This time around, focus is split between 
Blythes vocals and the dual guitar attack of Mor
ton and Adler. The new millenium begins now. 
Check out the band live this Friday... if you dare.

50 YEARS AGO
October 5,1954
Initial plans for a new fraternity quadrangle were announced following meetings 
between the 12 fraternities and the Institute. The meetings were used to gauge the 
organizations feelings on what the buildings should include. The first plans includ
ed four buildings, housing one fraternity each, to be located along Forbes Street 
west of Devon. These buildings were merged into a pair of duplexes before con
struction began and were later joined by the other pair of duplexes on Morewood.
25 YEARS AGO 
October 2,1979
WRCT hosted an open forum on the topic of cheating. Faculty and notable com
munity members were invited to discuss causes and solutions to cheating and pla
giarism. Professors Cliff Davidson and Hugh Young noted that instructors provide 
great temptation to cheat provided such as reusing assignments from previous 
years and promoting competition between students, but ultimately agreed that the 
final burden is on the student to resist it. Davidson also expressed his feeling that 
some students were spending more time studying cheating methods than studying 
the subject matter.
10 YEARS AGO 
October 3,1994
Two CIT students were taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct and 
obstructing traffic after a fight. The fight started on the fraternity quad and quickly 
proceeded to the middle of Forbes Avenue, where the participants blocked cars 
and shouted obscenities at each other and drivers. Eventually they moved to the 
Cut where CMU police were finally able to stop them. The police were accused of 
arresting the two students on racially motivated grounds, but Police Chief LaPaglia 
disputed that claim.
5 YEARS AGO 
October 4, 1999
Faculty Senates Human Relations Commission undertook a study to determine 
whether same-sex domestic partners of University employees should be eligible 
for the same benefits as spouses of University employees. They claimed that their 
goal was to balance the mutually exclusive tradition and equality. The study 
looked at institutions around the country, but ultimately decided that the decision 
must come from within. At the time of the study, it was unknown how many staff 
members would have partners eligible for inclusion if the benefits were extended. 
Eventually, benefits were extended to nontraditional partners.
1 YEAR AGO 
October 6,2003
Student Senate rejected a plan for the University to join the United States Student 
Association (USSA), the nations largest political lobbying group for students. The 
petition to join USSA, which had the required signatures, was presented to Senate, 
who debated the action before rejecting it by a vote of 9-12 with a single abstention. 
The proponents of the organization cited the good they had done for students, such 
as reducing restrictions on international students and raising the value of a Pell 
Grant. Opponents claimed that the referendum was in violation of Senate bylaws 
that prohibited Senate funding of political organizations.

Zox rocks for Habitat for Humanity
Violin is at the forefront of this creative rock band
The Rhode Island-based band Zox came back to Pitts
burgh last weekend, electrifying an excited audience 
with their energy-filled live show. The quartet was 
greeted by a combination of loyal fans and interested 
first-timers, but made sure no one left unsatisfied. From 
the opening chords of The Squid to the last refrain of 
Canon, the four boys from Providence put on a show 
that few could forget.
The concert, a benefit event for Habitat for Humanity, 
was held at Bellefield Hall, a small theatre venue much 
different from the other local places (The Underground, 
the Quiet Storm) they have played in the past. Since the 
show ran late, audience members expecting to see Zox 
play at 10 pm were instead treated to an enjoyable perfor
mance by the Pitt band SoulPatch. Though their vocals 
were occasionally drowned out by a poor soundboard, 
their songs still came across as catchy, if not memorable. 
They could best be described as a mellow cross between 
O.A.R. and the Screaming Trees. Though they have four 
very capable musicians, they never really cut loose and 
jam, teasing the listener each time they seemed to be 
taking their songs to another level.
After Soulpatchs entertaining set and an unusually long 
sound check, Zox jumped right in and never looked back. 
In their opener, old fan favorite The Squid, violinist 
Spencer Swain tore through the ominous opening solo 
and ripped through the rest of the song, leading into a 
mesmerizing instrumental ending that featured finger 
picking, posing bassists, crashing cymbals, and an in
tense finale that mirrored the story of singer Eli Millers 
heartfelt lyrics. This song set the pace for the night, as 
the boys flowed from song into song, pausing only for the 
occasional crowd banter that made the band seem like 
they were the same as the rest of us. They even stopped 
on many occasions call out to the Carnegie Mellon fans 
that were prevalent throughout the crowd. These breaks 
never lasted long, and before the crowd could figure out 
exactly what the band was saying, theyd taken off into 
another energetic piece.
Interspersed between songs from their first label album, 
-MAd pd qivd were new works that showcased the 
bands ability to create affective lyrics backed by memo
rable melodies. Most notable was the heated breakup 
song Burning Bridges, which delivered a scathing, al
most taunting sound, echoing the sentiment presented 
in the vocals, in which Miller sings, and when Im gone 
... youll be gone too.
However, the defining moment of the concert was Spen
cer Swains intense three-minute transition from radio 
single Rain On Me to the new piece Spades. Swain, 
who has been a classically trained violinist since the 
tender age of five, twirled a story from his wailing in
strument, showcasing a skill that is rarely seen at rock 
concerts. As the tempo of the piece escalated to move 
into the next song, the crowd erupted, setting the pace 
for the eventual finale, a cover of Johann Pachelbels 
famous Canon.
At the start of this song, the band brought the entire 
crowd to its feet. Many concertgoers spilled onto the 
stage itself, dancing clumsily to the songs classical-funk 
rhythms. As the adrenaline-laced concert finally came to 
an end, the band stayed for hours afterwards to meet the 
fans who had been dancing next to them.
Zox is one of the most original bands touring today. 
Rather than use the violin as accompaniment, like the 
band Yellowcard, they allow it to be the centerpiece of 
the band. The end result is a rich, emotional sound that 
can change from happy and energetic to slow and soul
ful in a heartbeat. Combine that with more energy than 
a high school cheerleading team, accomplished musi
cians, and conversations that are more nerd than rock 
star, and youve got an explosive combination.

Before Sunset
Pbtg9tOgS6f x8ykfVkf S9g Vd8ykC
Though most probably wont realize it, this movie is a sequel. Perhaps if 
they had kept its working title, Before Sunrise 2, people would be able to 
figure it out. At any rate, it probably wont get as bad as Two and a Half 
Weeks from Next Friday, or whatever theyre up to now. This film has Ethan 
Hawke running into Julie Delpy nine years after they first met, and now they 
have a chance to catch up on lovemaking and whatever else people do in 
romantic comedies. (Oh, right, long stretches of dialogue.)
The Saddest Music in the World
PlwrOgS6f fVkf S9g VdC
It looks like TBA is coming early this year, as we have Brent Neale play
ing the role of Polish Penis. This movie has a beer baroness from Depression-era Winnipeg looking for the saddest music in the world, and offering 
$25,000 for it. She has a glass leg or two, and she stores beer in it or them. 
Makes sense. Note: I have just been informed that Brent actually plays Pol
ish Pianist. Come to think of it, the Great Depression setting would make for 
really bad porn. But that seems to be the only kind AB brings to campus.
Laws of Attraction
P4rigS6f1 0, AND 12} x
Good God. Pierce Brosnan decided he wasnt satisfied butchering Bond 
films and went on to ruin the romantic comedy genre. Brosnan is a divorce 
lawyer who nonetheless believes in the power of love, marriage, and the 
American way. That, or the Irish way, which seems to involve a lot of alco
hol. If you want to have the whole movie spoiled, go read the first review 
on IMDB. I won't spoil it for you, except to say that I dislike Brosnan as an 
actor, and anything that he makes is crap.
The Day After Tomorrow
PRS.wrgS6f x8ykfVkf S9g Vd8yk/
The only things larger than all the meteorological phenomena pounding the 
world in this movie are the gaping plot holes. Sure, science fiction mov
ies have a long and proud tradition of leaning more towards the fiction 
than the science, but the purpose of that is to tell a realistic story within 
the unrealistic framework. Character motivation is key  why would the 
main character let his son go away when he knows the Ice Age is coming? 
Because if he didnt, there wouldn't be a movie.
Office Space
PRw9gS6f fVkf S9g VdC
Youve almost certainly seen this movie. Several people on your floor have it 
on DVD, and at least one unfortunate soul has entire scenes memorized. So 
why see it in McConomy? To start, you've got all the drunk people at the late 
showings. Its one thing to watch it drunk with friends, and another thing to 
watch it with drunk strangers who might have diseases. Much more excit
ing. If youre one of the few who hasn't caught this movie yet, go see it and 
understand what Swingline stapler" means. That's an order.

Indica is a new look at Pittsburghs Indian cuisine
Taste isnt cheap, but its well worth the price
Indica Indian Bistro 
257 North Craig Street 
Pittsburgh, PA 15213
Good Indian restaurants are hard to find in Pittsburgh. 
Like Chinese food, Indian food is often served as a cheap 
takeout dish (or in some cases, half-priced) thats doled 
out like mashed potatoes at a school cafeteria. When you 
buy low-quality Chinese food it comes in a mysterious 
brown sauce. Low-quality Indian food is much the same. 
A restaurant will keep virtually the same spice blend for 
all dishes. In a city like this, where most Indian food is the 
same spicy vegetable mush served by disgruntled wait 
staffers, Oaklands newest Indian restaurant, Indica In
dian Bistro, provides hope for the hungry.
Indica opened its doors on March 22 and is the brainchild 
of CMU alumnus Ram Kondur (93), who hopes to open 
many more restaurants like it. The restaurant is located 
in a small old house on Craig Street, which has been 
renovated. Upstairs there is a large party room, while the 
main dining area is on the lower level. The dining room 
is decorated in muted earthy tones with elegant Indian 
artwork adorning the walls. Indica caters to a more dis
cerning clientele than the average Indian restaurant, and 
the crowd in the restaurant was considerably older than 
most spots in Oakland when visited last week.

The structure ot Indica is actually an old house.
Besides its food, Indica shines for many reasons. First, 
its service is considerably better than any other Indian 
restaurant in Pittsburgh. Secondly, they do not ask you 
how spicy you want your order on a scale of 1-10. The 
existence of this scale is neither helpful to the customers 
(who always order the wrong level) nor the cooks (who 
dont give dishes the correct amount of spiciness to best 
bring out flavor). Instead Indica modestly marks its spicy 
dishes as such on the menu. Finally, not only are all of 
Indicas dishes made fresh and to order, but the recipes 
are one-of-a-kind. Indica highlights modem Indian cook
ing by being inventive.
Indica is not afraid to modify old classics, such as the 
paper-thin lentil and rice crepes called dosas which the 
restaurant turns into dosa crisps: spicy spring rolls with a 
dosa exterior. The menu is a good blend of Indian classics 
(such as vegetable biryani) and more inventive and di
verse dishes. Owner Ram Kondur attributes this medley 
to the fact that over 80 percent of his recipes are family 
secrets.
Indica has a good array of beverages from the spiced 
limeade, nimbupani, to the ever-present mango lassi. The 
wine list had some appealing wines, but I went for the 
mango margarita. The drink selection at Indica, both al
coholic and non-alcoholic, is very good but with prices to 
match. The mango margarita was good, but it could have 
been had elsewhere at a fraction of the $6.50 price.
The menu as a whole was very impressive. Wanting to ex
periment, I went for the tandoori mushroom appetizers 
and dosa crisps. Indicas spicy marker on foods is quite 
accurate: Speaking as someone who grew up on Indian 
food, I say both dishes were quite hot. Underneath the 
heat, however, were more complex flavors. The crisps, 
an interesting variation on the spring roll, and the mush
rooms, fresh from the tandoori oven, came with little slic
es of cucumber and tomato to cut the heat. Both of these 
dishes were inventive: They had the creative spark that 
can excite even the most hardened Indian restaurant pa
tron simply because they do new things with old classics. 
This type of creativity is rare in Pittsburgh but something 
that good Indian cooks are not afraid to play around with, 
resulting in new and exciting dishes.
My entree, the vegetarian tikka, was composed of cauli
flower, tomatoes, bell peppers, and paneer  a firm Indi
an cheese  served on a sizzling plate. Almost as exciting 
as the entree were the extras served with it. The entrees 
at Indica come with rice, dal, a vegetable (in my case 
broccoli), raita, and a side salad. The extras were enough 
to turn a single dish into a full meal; one dish was enough 
for myself and my companion. Care was put into these ex
tra side dishes so that they complemented and rounded 
out. The tikka dish I ordered was well spiced, flavorful 
without being too hot, and very fresh. The paneer had a 
chewy meaty texture, indicating that it had been cooked 
to perfection. When first looking at the menu the high 
prices ($13-16 per entree) seemed daunting, but once 
the food came out it was apparent where that money was 
going. Indica serves up generous portions with all the fix
ings. One entree plus the salad, dal, vegetable, and rice
was plenty for my friend and me.
For the budget-conscious or the very hungry, Indica 
serves a lunch buffet from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm. Again, 
while the price ($9) seems a bit high, the quality of the 
food is worth the extra money. The lunch buffet is a lav
ish spread providing diners with fresh salad, bread and 
rice, at least four vegetable dishes, appetizers, a couple 
of meat dishes, and dessert. The buffet features Indian 
standards, as well as some of Indicas own creations. The 
pakoras (small fried vegetable dumplings) were crispy 
and hot, and the traditional eggplant cooked in tama
rind sauce was soft and flavorful. When sampling the 
vegetable dishes, I thought each one was better than the 
last. The buffet is a wonderful find: While lunch places in 
Oakland abound, it is rare to find one with such a good 
variety and high level of quality in its buffet food.
If you often eat at Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, Indica 
is not the restaurant you will be expecting. Its not fast, 
its not cheap, all the food doesnt have the same spice 
mixture, and they wont ask how hot you want your food 
on a scale of 1-10. What Indica does do is get creative 
with traditional Indian cooking to serve up complex new 
dishes that are worth both the cost and the walk down 
Craig Street.

Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts
School of Drama and Pittsburgh Cultural Trust pair to bring amazing new works from abroad
Festival is a word that evokes a certain response, bring
ing up images of the outdoors, culture, and celebration 
all blending into one. The Pittsburgh International Festi
val of Firsts is a three-week-long series of events inviting 
participants into this setting, asking them to open their 
eyes to what is fresh and uncommon. This unique com
bination of companies from around the globe has come 
to Pittsburgh for the Festival of Firsts due in large part to 
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and the Carnegie Mellon School 
of Drama. Next weekend begins the first event, bringing 
new art forms to the United States.
The Festival features seven companies from diverse areas 
of the world. The Festivals guidebook urges audiences to 
[e]nter unexplored territory, where dance and theater, 
opera and visual art, history and future meet and merge 
into new art. The Festival is an unusual spectacle, par
ticularly in Pittsburgh, which is not a common venue for 
displays of new forms of art. Although not the most re
nowned for its cultural activities, Pittsburgh has had a
considerable amount of local flavor, even modem works, 
for some time now.
Appearing next week is a thorough mixture of different 
art forms. The Festival of Firsts will feature some big 
name acts who have received a lot of praise abroad, 
such as Theatre Titanick and Pappa TARAHUMARA, but 
also featured are smaller, less recognized groups. Each 
event has been organized specifically so that visitors may 
travel from performance to performance on any given 
day, with small breaks in between. Despite the events di
versity, Bradley sees a common theme between them. I 
hope there are very clear thematic connections. [There 
are] meant to be conversations with the other shows, he 
said.
As half of the partnership that brought the Festival to life, 
the School of Drama has had a considerable influence on 
the end result. Elizabeth Bradley, the head of the School 
of Drama, has worked as the artistic director throughout
the time leading up to the Festival. Bradley says that she 
was one of the first to hear about ideas to bring such a 
large-scale series to the area when she attended a meet
ing with Carol Brown, former director of the Pittsburgh 
Cultural Tmst. Brown wanted to bring a visual festival to 
Pittsburgh, something comparable to a performance-ori
ented version of The Carnegie International, according to 
Bradley.
Bradley was asked to continue her work with the trust 
providers. She describes the criteria dictating how com
panies would be chosen: What emerged was this notion 
that these companies would either have never visited 
America, or if they had they would bring [new work]. 
The focus, Bradley said, was to be imagery; despite the 
fact that the works would be performances, they would 
still be highly based on sight.
Even with these criteria narrowing down possibilities, 
there were about 60 companies that Bradley had to sift 
in order to find the type of work that was needed. One of 
her main helpers on this endeavor was Carlos Armesto, a 
graduate student working on his MFA in directing. Arm
esto was named artistic director and company manager 
due to his previous experiences with festivals of this na
ture. Together, Armesto and Bradley looked at the mate
rials the companies had to offer and gave input to the 
Pittsburgh Cultural Tmst, presenting them with the full 
60-company list. In a single year, rather than over the 
customary three-year period, Bradley and others had to 
coordinate the bulk of the production for the Festival, 
an impressive feat in itself.
Armesto has had a completely hands-on experience 
with the Festival of Firsts, despite being a student. It is 
apparent from his demeanor that the the Festival be a 
great success. While detailing the different events, he 
joked about having a lot of production background 
now, even though he wasnt getting an MFA in produc
tion. As artistic director and company manager he has 
seen more facets of the world of Festival coordination 
than most directors ever will. The first part of his job 
entails giving input on which of the companies should 
be considered, and, from there, picking among those 
that remain. The management end of his position is 
a far more detailed process. Ive also been given the 
responsibility of finding some venues for the shows. [I 
also] enabled the visa process, said Armesto. He con
tinued to describe the work he did directly with the dif
ferent companies, ensuring that their needs were taken 
care of to help make the process of coming to the U.S. 
more comfortable.
Both Bradley and Armesto detail some of the challenges8INss:e7d 4 irue:Ly 2004.

---------------------------------------------------

involved in organizing an event of this magnitude. Armesto is working his thesis production this year; however, 
he has been able to take time out of his schedule to work 
on the Festival. Because the companies are all foreign, 
problems arose from several areas while the festival was 
being organized. Bradley mentioned that some of the 
technical details were confused by the differences in 
standard hardware used for the building of sets, sculp
tures, and parts. Armesto more directly experienced a 
more obvious issue with dealing with foreign lands: the 
issue of visas. Many of the companies had been able sim
ply to mail in their visa applications and were not used 
to the policies of larger countries such as the U.S., which 
require visa applicants to go to the embassy and some
times have an interview.
Despite the challenges, the end result, now fast approach
ing, is an important event for the city of Pittsburgh. Arm
esto feels that the event blurs the lines between video, 
performance, sculpture. For Pittsburgh to host an event 
like that.... No other city has a festival like this in which 
we are melding different media to create a really poi
gnant and piercing effect. Beyond that, Armesto is ex
cited for the city at large to be able to host the Festival. 
This is something thats revolutionary. The work thats 
being presented is what the future of theater is; its not

fabled ship with a main cast of merely six characters.
going to be a sort of linear narrative, he said, describing 
the contemporary nature of the pieces.
Pittsburgh benefits from the unusual quality of the work, 
but so too does Carnegie Mellon, Armesto emphasized. 
It can only shed really good light on this school. Its [the 
school] very noted in musical theater actors and... highly 
recognized in design. Weve produced Hollywood direc
tors of incredible stature. This is more niche. If you want 
to call it avant-garde you can, said Armesto. He noted 
that being able to go beyond the mainstream theater, for 
which Carnegie Mellons drama school is best known, is 
lending a level of recognition to the school not seen be
fore. It is quite thrilling, he noted, To have a school that 
can say we can produce Broadway ... and we can also 
produce the most exciting thing that comes from around 
the world.
The newness of the work will hopefully attract many 
people to experience at least one or two of the perfor
mances. They truly do have a wide range of attraction, 
going from Akhe Group, which uses visual theater and 
props such as bubble gum and milk, to Theatre Titanick,
which tells the famous story of the sinking ship with six 
actors and the actual construction of an 80-foot struc
ture on the stage. Pittsburgh will host Theatre Titanick 
in a new sort of venue: on a barge. This lends a punch of 
risk to the already enormous production.
Next weekend will begin the first of the productions, 
large and small. There is little doubt that they will create 
a lot of talk in the city, and Carnegie Mellon as well. For 
those that have worked on bringing such a huge event 
to this area, it may be time to finally sigh with relief. As 
for the rest of Pittsburghs residents, it can only be hoped 
that they will receive the works with open minds, and 
appreciate the opportunity they, as residents, have to 
see something that has never entered the country before 
now.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): No amount of animal-rights activism 
now will alleviate your guilt over a childhood of ditch-digging and 
recreational large game hunting.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Your new yoga and aerobic workout 
regimen will help you get in touch with parts of yourself that you 
never realized existed before, including your lower back, toes, 
and whatever it is that makes the cute girl in pigtails two mats to the left actually 
attracted to you.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): After waiting 48 minutes  without shelter  for 
a bus to drive you the two blocks from campus to your apartment, you will finally 
decide to give up on riding and make the trek through the freezing wind and rain. 
Your clothes may weigh 55 pounds and your skin may be pruney, but youll have calf 
muscles of steel.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Your exam-related anxiety will bring back your acne 
to full eighth grade school dance strength, starting a vicious cycle that can only be 
cured by listening to your mail-order instructional relaxation tapes and Enya.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): You will soon discover, through a baffling series of social 
snafus, that while you may have a great sense of humor, few people are truly sophis
ticated enough to get you. That can make life in stand-up comedy  and, well, 
life in general  a bit tough.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Finally cleaning out your bedroom closet will 
unexpectedly release enough wild game for a romantic dinner for two, thanks to your 
sharp eye and quick reflexes.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): With cosmetic surgery, you get what you pay 
for, especially when you use a coupon for a free hair transplant with purchase.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Thanks to your uncommon intelligence, it 
wont take you a third try to learn that milk is not an impulse buy: you should just 
place the warm carton back on the floor by the soap opera magazine rack where you 
found it.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Your new haircut will seem to take 
five years off your life. At least, it will if you keep going to that $3 blind barber with 
the rusty scissors without having a recent tetanus shot.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Be more specific this year when you ask 
Mom and Dad for a furry birthday pet, and maybe your new fish won't get a fungus 
after three days.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): To protect your beloved goldfish during your 
wild party Saturday night, you will move their bowl to the coffee table by the window 
in your apartment. While the reflective glass may not actually help provide your fish 
with a lovely natural vista, telling yourself it does will make you feel a little less guilty 
about not entertaining poor Flipsy and Flopsy for the evening.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Wish for worlcLpeace instead of a life of wealth 
and leisure the next time the pageant judge hands you the microphone, and maybe 
you wont end up sitting alone in your large beachfront estate, looking at your watercolor collection, listening to a string quartet, getting a massage, and being bored out 
of your gourd while your butler runs to get your martini.I LAST TEAR

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
f
For weeks, Fernando hoarded the poisoned bread crumbs 
brought by the old gypsy woman, hiding them in his pantry.
Then one day, surveying his pile of lies, he decided that he 
had enough to take care of his archnemesis Rogelio. But 
how to convince Rogelio to eat the bread crumbs? The duck 
would only eat the finest of foods, and nothing so common 
as bread crumbs... but would he eat foie gras? Almost can
nibalism, true, being the liver of another fowl, but perhaps 
Rogelio, being the anarchist he was, would eat such delicacies without remorse. And so, 
out of pure spite for his enemy, Fernando waited silently by the darkest edges of the 
pond at dusk, and kidnapped the weakest of the ducks unfortunate enough to paddle 
alone in the darkness.

Queen and Country: Covert Agents in a Hall of Smoke and Mirrors
The Tom Clancy world of espionage and intelligence is a 
crock. The Cold Wars over, and no one in the spy busi
ness remains under the childish illusion that theres a big 
red octopus out there digging its tentacles into the Third 
World. Clancy is content to just invent a new big interna
tional enemy, but, in reality, thats not the threat we face 
today. Threats are pluralistic, allegiances are liquid, and if 
you entertain doubts about what happens in covert opera
tions, try and imagine what its like for the agents in the 
field. How do they maintain faith in their paradoxical and 
quixotic orders?
This question is at the heart of Greg Ruckas Queen and 
Country, from Oni Press. Rucka is a successful crime 
novelist, and this has been his first foray into comics. 
To preserve the illusion of continuity between articles 
here in Comickaze, heres what Warren Ellis (creator of 
Transmetropolitan, featured last week) has to say about 
Queen and Country in the foreword to the first collection, 
Broken Ground:
Queen and Country is the best illustration I know of the 
cold hard fact that a lot of people try to ignore: Of all the 
visual, narrative media, comics are now the place where 
the most intelligent and challenging work is done. Start 
here, with one of my favorites.
Tara Chase, the main character in Queen and Country, is 
an agent for the British SIS. Designated Minder Two, 
shes part of an elite branch of covert operations that 
handle the most sensitive missions. Three years in the ser
vice have completely ground away her soul, leaving her a 
hollow, cynical husk of a woman. Shes long since lost her 
patriotic spirit, and executes missions now with a total 
lack of concern regarding the reasons for or effects of her 
actions. At home in London she drowns herself in alcohol, 
shutting herself in her flat. She has only the sting of fear 
from each mission to remind her that she still possesses 
the will to live.
Another interesting character is Paul Crocker, the director 
of operations for the Minders. Crocker is an explosive mix 
of paranoid obsession with international threats and pas
sionate need to assert the effectiveness and relevance of 
the Minders in the post-Cold War world. This quest to be a 
big fish in a shrinking pond often lands him in trouble, as 
it makes him vulnerable to simple manipulation from the
CIA. In the first story this weakness puts Tara in danger 
with the Russian mafia. The increasingly dangerous mis
sions Crocker arranges contribute to the accelerating pace 
of Taras psychological downward spiral.
Several artists have worked on the project. Steve Rolston, 
the original artist and greatest contributor, established a 
largely caricatured and emotionally transparent approach 
to the characters thats been upheld throughout the series. 
Mike Norton signed on as artist this past month, picking 
up the slack on the Saddlebags story arc, which takes 
place in Moscow. Nortons style is more polished, and it 
brings a whole new slant to the telling of the story.
The main thrust of the story, however, is its poignant 
political, moral, and emotional complexity. Rucka leaves 
lots of space in the plot to let the characters meander 
through the many different reactions and perspectives 
that could be drawn from the intense situations in which 
they are mired.
What Queen and Country is not, however, is another 
rehash of the old Do the ends justify the means? spy 
thriller hook. Queen and Country offers a deeper level 
of insight. Through a more existential lens, Rucka ques
tions whether there are even ends or means in the first 
place, and whether espionage has any realistic meaning 
whatsoever, in a modern context. Perhaps the missions 
impose their own meaning to rationalize the continued 
production of a culture of espionage that manufactures 
its own drama. But the story does not blindly overshoot in 
this thinking; the very existence of threats to peace is not 
brought into question. The complexity lies in the shape of 
the organization that has evolved to handle them, and its 
effects on the lives of its individual members.
If youre a spy enthusiast, and crappy movies like The 
Bourne Identity leave you with an uncontrollable urge to 
gouge out your own eyeballs with a salt-covered spatula, 
then maybe you should sate your desire for something 
more than car chases and stop by the Carnegie Library to 
pick up a Queen and Country collection. Now thats enter
tainment with some real intelligence!
