VOL. IV, No. 9 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1909 TEN CENTS(The (Tnrrnti
Tech Loses to Marietta
On Saturday last the football team took a trip to 
Marietta, Ohio, to play Marietta College. The day 
was decidedly warm and that, together with a fivehour car ride in the morning and a strange field, took 
the edge off the players. The result was that we lost 
the game 13 to 0.
The team did not play with one-fifth the snap and 
dash that marked the P. & M. game the week before. 
It was, without a doubt, the poorest game that Tech 
has played this season. The game was played on the 
fair grounds. The playing field was very uneven, 
there being a decided slope to the northward. The 
Marietta team outweighted Tech in every department 
and played a splendid game. Their backs were espe
cially good in running with the ball, having an inter
ference that was hard to break up. Perhaps the best 
ground gainer for Marietta was the cross-tackle 
bucks with Captain Dayton or Greene carrying the 
ball.
Marietta considered this game the greatest home 
game of the season and a large crowd turned out to 
see the contest.
Captain Hittner won the toss and chose to defend 
the north goal.
First Half.
Morris kicked the ball for Tech to Mariettas 9-yard 
line, Ellis getting the ball but running out of bounds. 
Hull gained eight yards around right end. Gardner 
went through the line for five yards, which Ellis fol
lowed with two more around left end. Gardner again 
made four yards through the line. Ellis, who played 
a fine game at left half, made four yards, followed 
by Hull with five more. On the next play Ellis
failed to gain. Marietta was penalized 20 yards and 
Nye failed to gain on an end run. Marietta kicked 
but recovered the ball on their own 40-yard line. 
Gardner gained only three yards and Ellis failed to 
gain. Marietta was forced to kick, the ball going to 
Techs 35-yard line. -
Hittner caught the ball and ran it back 15 yards. 
Robinson gained only three yards on a line buck and 
Flick could only gain four on an end run. Tech was 
forced to kick, Dolin booting the ball to Mariettas 
20-yard line.
Ellis ran it back 15 yards. On a tackle play Greene 
gained six yards. This was Mariettas best ground 
gainer, both Greene and Captain Dayton gaining 
much ground in this manner. Ellis ran around left 
end for 11 yards and Hull went around right end for 
four yards more. Captain Dayton gained three yards 
on the tackle play. Neither Gardner nor Hull could 
make the distance and Dayton was forced to kick, 
the ball going to Techs four-yard mark, a punt of 
42 yards.
Hittner received the ball and returned it 12 yards 
before being downed. A forward pass was then 
worked successfully for 15 yards. This was one 
of the very few forward passes used in the game, the 
game consisting mostly of the old style football. 
Coldren gained five yards on the quarter-back run 
and Flick followed him up with nine yards around 
left. end. Robinson could gain only one yard through 
the line, but on the next play added two more. An
other forward pass was tried and Hittner received 
the ball on Marriettas 35-yard line, a gain of 25 
yards. Robinson gained two yards on a line plunge.

4THE TARTAN
Tech was penalized 20 yards for oft side. Dolin 
kicked to Mariettas 35-yard line, Hull running the 
ball back five yards.
Hull gained 12 yards around Dolins end. Ellis fol
lowed with six more. On the next play Marietta 
fumbled but recovered the ball without loss. Tech 
was penalized five yards more for off side. Greene, 
on the tackle play, gained 15 yards. Gardner gained 
five more through the line, but was throWn for a loss 
of two yards on the next play. Marietta kicked to 
Techs 5-yard line. Tech, on the line-up, also kicked, 
the ball going to her 28-yard line.
Captain Dayton gained five yards but Gardner 
could only go one. Marietta again kicked, the ball 
again going to the 5-yard mark.
Hittner ran the ball back seven yards and on the 
next play Mariettas line held. Tech was forced to 
kick.
Dayton got the ball on Techs 35-yard line and re
turned it four yards. Gardner could only gain one 
yard on a straight buck through the line. Marietta, 
who was gaining by this exchange of punts, again 
kicked, Hittner getting the ball on his 5-yard line 
and returning it seven yards.
Flick failed to gain around left end and Dolin 
again was forced to punt. Again Dayton received 
the ball and ran it back eight yards. On two suc
cessful crcss-bucks Dayton carried the ball to Techs 
15-yard line. Gardner could only gain one yard. On 
the next play, however, he went over the line for the 
first touchdown. Dayton missed an easy goal. Score 
Marietta 5, Tech 0.
Hittner kicked off to Hull on the 15-yard line. 
Marietta was penalized five yards for off-side. Greene 
on a cross buck gained 20 yards. Ellis gained five 
more around Techs left end. By running the ends 
and bucking the line hard the ball was carried to 
Tech's 53-yard line. Dayton here went 15 yards on 
a cross buck. The ball then see-sawed between 
Techs 50 and 20-yard lines, the half ending with it 
in Techs possession on her own 45-yard mark.
Second Half.
Dayton kicked off to Coldren on the 33-yard line. 
The Marietta men downed Coldren in his tracks. 
Hittner failed to gain and Dolin punted 40 yards to 
Nye, on Techs 53-yard line.
Marietta tried a fake kick but it failed to gain 
anything. Dayton tried his cross-line buck but 
was held without gain. Marietta was forced to kick-, 
the ball going to Hittner on the 20-yard line. Robin
son gained four yards on a line plunge. Marshal 
was called back but could only make a scant three 
yards. Robinson then made a beautiful run of 31 
yards on a line buck. He got completely away from 
the line and was only downed by Nye. Hittner was 
thrown for a loss and Dolin was called upon for a 
punt. He kicked to Mariettas 10-yard line, Nye 
recovering the ball and returning it six yards.
Marietta could not gain and was forced to punt. 
Coldren caught the ball and returned it four yards.
Flick was tackled for a 3-yard loss and Robinson 
could only gain one yard. Dolin kicked, the ball 
crossing the field, but traveling only six yards to
wards Mariettas goal.
Hull gained four yards on an end run and Ellis 
followed him with six more. On three successive 
cross-tackle bucks Captain Dayton gained 20 yards, 
placing the ball on Techs 34-yard line. Ellis could 
only go a yard and Dayton was again called upon. 
He gained only three yards this time and, as Gardner 
also failed to make the distance, it was Techs ball 
on her own 26-yard line.
Dolin punted 35 yards to Hull on his 50-yard line. 
Gardner shot through the line for a gain of six yards. 
Hull gained three and Dayton kicked to Coldren on 
Techs 5-yard line. Coldren ran it back to the 18- 
yard mark and Robinson carried it five yards fur
ther. Marshal was called back but failed to gain 
anything. Dolin kicked to the center of the field.
Dayton, on his cross buck, carried the ball to 
Techs 16-yard line, where he was tackled by Coldren. 
Gardner gained nine yards through the line, but on 
the next try could barely make one. The ball was 
now within Techs 5-yard line. There was a decided 
slope of the field towards the goal line. Marietta had 
three downs to make four yards in but was unable to 
do it. The Tech team played like demons at this 
point, and if they had been able to show as much 
spirit and dash during the rest of the contest the 
score would have been very different.
Tech received the ball on her 1-yard line. The 
ropes that enclosed the field were so close that Dolin 
had to step over them to punt. The kick was 
blocked and went outside, where Drumm recovered 
it, thus scoring a safety for Marietta. ScoreMari
etta 7, Tech 0.
The ball was put into play on the 25-yard line. 
Flick made three yards around the end and Dolin 
booted the ball to Mariettas 46-yard line, where Nye 
received it and ran it back three yards. By line 
bucks Marietta carried the ball to Techs 56-yard line. 
Here Captain Dayton punted, the ball going over the 
goal line.
The ball was put in play again on the 25-yard line. 
Hittner failed to make any gain but Flick made three 
yards. Dolin punted to Mariettas 56-yard line.
Marietta took the ball from this point right over 
the goal line by end runs and cross bucks. Gardner 
made the touchdown and Dayton kicked the goal. 
ScoreMarietta 13, Tech 0.
Tech kicked to Mariettas 6-yard line. Marietta 
carried the ball to Techs 27-yard mark on 11 plays, 
all straight football. Here a forward pass was 
worked, 16 yards being gained. Gardner was unable 
to make anything through the line and Dayton could 
only gain one yard on his cross buck. The ball was 
punted over the goal line and was brought out to the 
25-yard line. Dolin punted to Mariettas 58-yard 
mark, but before the teams could line up time was 
called. Final scoreMarietta 13, Tech 0. .

THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR 
BEGINNERS.
TANGENTS AND COTANGENTS. The lower scale 
of the reversed slide, marked T, gives the tangents 
of angles from 6 to 45. The ends of the T scale 
are made to coincide with the D scale, then any 
tangent is found opposite its angle in degrees. If the 
angle exceeds 45 the tangent is found by the trigo
nometric relation tan x=l tan (90-x), which is
is less than 6 the cotangent equals the reciprocal 
of the sine, very nearly.

Fig 19. Cotangents of Angles.
In working out expressions containing trigonom
etric functions, it is often necessary to turn the slide 
over during the operation and finish on the reverse 
side. As an illustration.
45 tan 2 27 10'
----------------- .833
21 sin 42 55'
In this case the square of tan 27 10' is divided by 
sin 42 55'. Keeping the runner at the result, the
slide is reversed and the result divided by 21 and
multiplied by 45, giving the final result stated above. 
The diagram for this operation is shown in Fig. 
18. The letters A, B, C, D indicate where the slide 
was turned over.
LOGARITHMS OF NUMBERS. The middle scale 
on the back of the slide' gives the logarithms of 
numbers from 1 to 10 (mantissa only, the character
istic to be found by inspection). The method of
reading the logarithm is to set the left end of the
slide to the given number on the D scale, turn the 
scale over (without disturbing the slide) and read

easily solved on the slide rule. These directions 
are briefly given by the diagram of Fig. 16.
When the angle exceeds about 84, the tangent can 
be found quite exactly from the reciprocal of the sine. 
For example, tan

The cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent: it 
is also equal to the tangent of the complementary 
angle. Hence the cotangent from 6 to 84 can be 
found as shown in Fig. 17. When the angle exceeds 
84 the cotangent equals the sine of the complement. 
For example cot 87 equals the sine 3. If the angle

example, take the expression.

TWO AND AN EXTRA.
Doring was lieutenant in the company; his pay 
small, his capacity for getting rid of it, large. He 
had been a welcome caller at the Colonels house and 
had been looked upon as an especial friend of Nancy 
Warton, the Colonels niece. But that was before 
Mr. Mansdale, the new government official, appeared 
on the scene with a free heart and a full purse. 
Then Nancys mother took a hand in the affair. Dor
ing was made to feel himself a thirdby Mrs. Warten. The garrison saw from the first that it was a 
match from Mrs. Wartons standpoint.
Doring's visits finally ceased, and the Colonels 
house saw him no more. Everything was working 
out now in Mr. Mansdales favor. Nancy seemed 
reconciled, and the two were as good as married. 
Mrs. Warton, however, had reckoned without those 
two strong allies, Youth and Love.
Nancy began to require a long walk each day for 
the good of her health. Her health did seem im
proved, for always she came back with glowing 
cheeks and the best of spiirts. Even Mansdales 
visits failed to change her happy countenance.
One day Nancy failed to return from her walk. 
Instead, some two hours later, a telegram came back 
from a station several miles beyond. The hope of 
Mrs. Warton received a dash of cold water, and 
Mansdales hand, if not his heart, was still free. 
The telegram read, Are on our honeymoon. Nancy 
and Harry.
All of which goes to show that he laughs best 
who laughs last. Helen Stewart, 11.
The Dramatic Club has constructed a property 
box, and as the contents at present are meagre, and 
the need for materials pressing, it is hoped that 
anybody having old gowns, coats, hats, and the like, 
will contribute. Uncut materials of any kind will be 
received with open arms. Old silks, satins, or bro
cades, and even pins, are sadly needed.
On Tuesday of last week the Faculty, assisted by 
the Senior Class, gave a reception in the Faculty 
rooms in honor of the Plebe Class. Most of the study 
body was present, where they passed in solemn file 
down the receiving line. Mrs. HRmprsohlasr helped 
receive with the Faculty and the Senior president.
The rooms were prettily decorated with autumn 
leaves and crysanthemums, and the refreshment 
table was carried out as far as possible in the class 
colorsyellow and white.
The phonetic method of teaching the alphabet to 
children has its disadvantages. It has been found 
that children who are thoroughly familiar with this
method, do not know how to use the dictionary be
cause they cannot unify the letters.
We have heard of wash-ladies, but never before of 
deified washerwomen. A record of history, however, 
must be true.
To illustrate the involuntary breathing, Professor 
Esquerre asked, If I should place a newly-born rab

it would do?
AnswerTurn over.
Any man running out of pet names for his wife 
(or sweetheart) should apply to the Babylonians. An 
interesting tablet has been discovered containing a

Once in the year of Fanny Farmers book,
Girls that I knew were sent to school to cook.
But in the schools they taught the girls to make 
Not only healthy things, but also fake 
Rhyme that the teacher said was not so worse,
So in her desperation one wrote this verse:
Just a line of nonsense 
Rolled in cracker crumbs,
Dipped in egg and butter,
Shaped to look like plums.
When the fire is hottest 
And the lard is right,
Fry until a light brown 
Just fit to bite.
Tis guaranteed to be a most delicious piece of 
poetry. Helen Day, 10.
Mr. T. O. Wasson entertained a number of the 
Civil Engineering students at the Civil Club meeting 
Saturday evening. The other part, not desiring to 
leave it all to Tec, arranged for entertainment else
where. Being rather well acquainted with Mr. Was
son, we do not care to pass judgment upon the wis
dom of the other part.

EDITORIAL
The editors have received an interesting and in
structive paper on Measures and Weights, by Dr. 
H. S. Schapper, of the School of Applied Design. The 
paper will appear in its entirety in an early issue.
PLANT THE THISTLE.
The experience of the past two years should go a 
very long way toward making this 1910 edition of 
The Thistle an easier book to get out. It will be 
remembered that on those occasions (particularly 
the former) continuous warfare of no gentle variety 
raged and stormed for months over questions that 
have not to be gone over again this year. It was just 
as well to have all of the trouble when it occurred 
and get it over with, since it had to come. The book 
is an all-schools affair, and the editor-in-chief is to 
be chosen from the eligible members of the four 
schools in rotation; this much is settled for all time. 
At present there is nothing to do but elect the board 
and let them get to work. The selection of the 
editor-in-chief will be made from the School of Ap
plied Design this year, and there is no reason why it 
cannot be done at once. If all of the representatives 
and members of the board are chosen and installed 
before Christmas, the present years Thistle will 
establish a record that none of the others have ever 
approached. Lets cut out the argument this year, 
and let the board get to work.
HOW ABOUT YOUR LOAN?
The affairs of the Athletic Association need a few 
preliminary remarks before the official report is made 
by the treasurer. The student body need to be re
minded that the field is not altogether paid for. For 
this reason we cannot afford to loaf on the job. It 
seems to be the style around here to get something 
started with a fine display of shout and racket, big 
talk and enthusiam, and then after the first dribble 
of work has been accomplished to drop it all like a 
hot brick. This way of doing business doesnt build 
athletic fields.
Added to the debts of the Association are the oneyear loan notes made out last winter and spring. 
These count as one of the heaviest items to drain 
the resources of the treasury. We suggest that all 
of the one, two and three-year loans be cancelled by 
the men who made them, turning them into gifts to 
the Association. They need them all made non-collectable. The sacrifice of parting with the amount 
was felt at the time they were made. It would not 
now be a sacrifice and in nearly every case not even an 
inconvenience. By filling out one of the blanks 
printed in this issue and giving it to Mr. Leeds, or 
Charles, or dropping it into any of the open mail 
boxes in the school buildings, it will reach the proper 
persons. If this is not done, the Association surely 
will be up against it when it tries to straighten out 
affairs after the close of the football season.
THE BOARD OF CONTROL.
It may be startling news to some to learn that the 
Athletic Association has no Board of Control. The 
adopted constitution provides for the membership 
of the Board, but we learn that these provisions have 
not been complied with. Yes, a few of the classes 
have elected their representatives, but the Board of 
Control does not happen to be composed of the rep
resentatives of a few of the classes; it must have all. 
The way things stand at present, nothing can be de
cided, planned or even talked about. No expression 
of opinion or action of any kind can be had on any 
of the Associations affairs. As we Said last week, 
the entire weight of the responsibility rests on the 
shoulders of Manager Bright and Treasurer Charles. 
This is not fair to them or to Tech. If one-tenth of 
the energy used in framing the lengthy constitution 
was utilized in carrying out the most important of its 
provisions, we might get somewhere. This student 
body has run everything calling for co-operation dur
ing the past eight months, like a bunch of old women, 
and previous to that time like a flock of sheep. There 
doesnt seem to be enough men around to keep the 
children from putting up their hands to tell teacher.
TALKJUST PLAIN TALK.

sortment of language and talk used up in circulating 
rumors of divers kinds than has been the case for a

long while. One of the Sundays papers came out 
with the startling information displayed in headlines, 
that some kind providence was about to come our 
way and hand us $60,000 for a stadium to be placed 
on the Athletic field. This proposed stadium is con
tingent upon certain exigencies coming to pass, and 
in that event Tech will have one of the greatest col
lege fields in the country. This particular piece of 
gossip has been going the rounds for the last two 
months, and the most careful and thorough inquiries 
have failed to locate any certain exigencies or good 
fairies desiring to pass out any coin. It would be a 
very fine thing for Tech if anything of the kind hap
pened, and no doubt could be made a very fine thing 
for the memory of the donor as well, but there is no 
chance to count any chickens if the eggs have not 
even been laid. It might be well to wait until some
one comes around with the cash before we begin to 
argue about it.

aaJsi5i3i3JSJaMBjaM3isiajajaaisj3i3JsrajaiaBjajsiaiai3jaiB]aj3jii
BENEFIT OF FOOTBALL TEAM.
The members of the School of Applied Design will 
present the most colossal aggregation of minstrel 
talent ever assembled in the city when they give 
their levithan histronic and musical hash, entitled 
Lockstables Minstrels. Eight fifteen, on the even
ing of November 23, is the hour chosen for the first 
performance of the gigantic company. The entire 
drawing room No. 220, in the Apprentice and 
Journeymens building, will be given over to the riot 
of melody and fun. Stage arrangements will be 
made complete and elaborate settings will accom
pany each scene. The difficulties of properly manag
ing the details of putting this monstrous affair on the 
boards have at last been successfully solved by 
clever stage manipulation. The Seven Southern Sis
ters will sing several sentimental songs, and the 
Eight Aerial Acrobats will astound the aggregation of 
open-mouthed spectators.
Mr. Edward J. Napier, one of the most noted or
ganists and choir directors of Pittsburg, who directed 
The Pirates of Penzance last year, has been re
hearsing the songs, which bid fair to eclipse  any 
heard this season, and Mr. J. L. Grimes, who for two 
years was the leader of the Princeton Mandolin Club, 
has been giving his services at rehearsals. An orig
inal sketch written and staged by W. B. Edmundson, 
who was the stage director and coach of the White 
Friars during the past two seasons, will be produced 
for the first time on any stage.
E. D. James will occupy the prominent position of 
middleman, while the ends will be Decker, Shepard, 
Jones and Allison. A large chorus of trained and se
lected voices will fill the rear of the stage and ac
company the many solos to be rendered. The Har
mony Quartet, the pride of the Glee Club, will be 
there with bells on. We regret that our early hour 
of going to press prevents only this passing notice of 
the grandeur of the affair. Its for the football team, 
so everybody out to see the fun. Tickets can be had 
from almost any member of the School of Applied 
Design.
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The last meeting of the Civil Engineering Society 
was held last Saturday night. Mr. Theron Wasson 
was the center of attraction with a discourse of Rail
road Surveys and Snakes I Have Caught. After ex
hibiting trophies of the chase and quoting from the 
Philistine, he retired amid the applause of the large 
audience. A feed consisting of ice cream and hot 
dog, served in tasty style by Curties C. Colfax Col
well, concluded a delightful and entertaining evening.

THE SCRUBS VS. PLEBE GAME.
On Wednesday, at 4.30, the Plebes stacked up 
against the Scrubs for a pretty even game. The 
Plebes kicked off to Dyer, who ran it back 10 yards. 
Line plunges by Roe and Dyer carried the ball well 
down the field, but the Plebes braced and kicked 
out of danger. The Scrubs varied things by an end 
run, making a good gain. Plebes ball on downs, and 
again they punted for 30 yards. Half ended as Scrubs 
again were advancing ball by line rushes. Score: 
Scrubs 0, Plebes 0.
The second half the playing was faster and line 
plunges finally resulted in a touchdown for the 
Scrubs. McCorkle kicked the goal. Score: Scrubs
6, Plebes 0. The second half ended with the ball in 
the Plebes possession on Scrubs 20-yard line.

FIRST-YEAR DAY INDUSTRIALS.
Last Saturday the Plebe team journeyed to Car
negie, where they met the fast Carnegie Scholastics 
in an even game. Carnegie got away several times 
for good gains but usually lost the ball on downs.
The Plebes, by consistent playing, advanced the ball 
to Carnegies four-yard line, where it was lost on 
downs. Carnegie kicked out to 30-yard line and 
Mandeville returned five yards. An end run by 
Straub and a forward pass to Vatz put the ball on 
the 5-yard line when time was called. In the second 
half the Plebes recovered a punt and line plunges by 
Manderville and Hanson put the ball on the 15-yard

THE MARIETTA TRIP.
A Dance Was Given in Honor of the Football 
Team.
After arising at the unholy hour of six, the team 
embarked on a special car on a train on the ungodly 
B. & O., bound for Marietta, Ohio. After the usual 
amount of tribulation connected five solid hours in a 
railway coach that hops around double S curves on 
two wheels, or less, the team arrived at its destina
tion. Proceeding to the Wakefield Hotel rooms were 
assigned and everybody hit it up for the dining room, 
thinking to get something to take away the pain. The 
head waitress, as usual, a queen (blonde), thought 
that it was rest we needed and not food. We got it.
Dressing in the hotel, we were, taken to the field, 
the old fair grounds. The method of procedure for 
the next two hours is faithfully given on another page 
of this issue.

After the game we took another rest in the dining 
room, after which we did the town. It took quite 
some time, as there are five nickel shows in Mari
etta. This killed time until the real object of the 
whole trip came off, the dance.
The dance was as good as the girls, which is saying 
quite enough. Everybody had a dandy time. If you 
danced you certainly had your moneys worth, and if 
you did not you got it just the same by watching 
everybody tag the Coach (see the P. & I. column).

ask the Coach. Hell tell you about it, using adjec

up your pennies so that if we should go to another 
dance in Marietta next year you can be there with 
rings on your fingers and bells on your toes. Take

to stay over a few months.

I *I APPLIED DESIGN |

APPLIED DESIGN.
Last Monday evening the students of Applied De
sign gave a post charette smoker, which eclipsed all 
their former efforts.
Mr. Hornbostel was the first victim on the stump, 
and remained there a considerable time. In a speech 
bustling with wit, humor and pathos (?), he handed 
out bunches of advice, which, by the way, ought not 
to be taken too seriously. Mr. Hornbostel here threw 
a fit into the fellows by announcing that there would 
be no traveling scholarship this summer unless a 
minstrel show be given before Thanksgiving as a 
benefit for the football team.
The block was then bared for Mr. Goodwin by 
Chief Executioner Rigamount. Despite his plain
tive cries of call it off, his speech, like Roses feet, 
covered a lot of ground. Mr. Hornbostel was forced 
to reply owing to some home hits. These referred 
to the early days of the School, containing illusions 
to liquid refreshments, brought for the hearty 
choruses of Beer, Beer, etc. Mr. McGoodwin then 
stated what he thought would form a good architec
tural school. Mr. Hornbostel agreed in all particu
lars to this statement.
Mr. Bergey was called upon to make a speech 
which should not be like his definition of a differen
tial. His story was very moving, and contained no 
reference to mathematics, but did refer to a physical 
problem.
The stump was next forced under Mr. Ferrand, 
and, being unable to express himself in English, a 
lively pantomine followed.
Mr. Sparks was the next victim, and, wandering 
from the stump, wielded his little hammer in a lively 
fashion after discoursing on necessary evils.
Coach Snitjer handed out a talk full of ginger, 
making us appreciate the efforts of the team more 
than ever.
Mr. Lee then told a tale about musical troubles 
in a family.
After a few spasms by the Glee Club some very 
successful boxing matches were pulled off. Our Mr. 
Johnson was unfortunate enough to push his eye 
against his opponents glove, giving it with a sombre 
hue.
Our trumpter, Bowman, blew the men to the 
refreshments, which soon looked like Mr. Campbells 
room after an announcement that there would be no 
shades and shadows for the day.
