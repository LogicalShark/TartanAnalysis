Carnegie Mellon will be letting its 
lease of Carol and Tudor Apartments 
expire, and instead, setting up an 
arrangement with the management 
of Cathedral Mansions in Oakland. 
The Housing Office has also an
nounced that it will continue to lease 
the Marybelle Building, and the one 
bedroom, four-person units in Doherty 
Apartments will change to three-person units, starting in the 199495 
academic year.
Specific arrangements are expected 
to be finalized by February 28, and 
residents of Carol and Tudor will soon 
have to think about new places to 
live. Because their present spaces in 
the buildings will not be available, 
residents of Carol and Tudor will be 
given two types of priority status in 
the room selection process for the fall.
Of the approximately 45 available 
units in Cathedral Mansions, Carol 
and Tudor residents will be receiving 
status and will have first 
crack [at the newly-leased rooms] 
because theyre being moved from 
their current housing, said Assis
tant Director of Housing for Adminis
tration Dave Potter.
Rates for the new rooms will be 
released next week, but Housing has 
already given estimates. Cathedral 
Mansions has three types of apart
ments: efficiencies; one-bedroom, twoperson; and two-bedroom, three-per
son. Room rates will vary but Potter 
said cost will be comparable to 
Fairfax and Marybelle, which is ap
proximately $3,880 for a two-person 
unit. A question and answer session 
will be held tonight at 9 pm in Carol 
Room 10.
The move comes after many resi
dents of Doherty Apartments voiced 
their dissatisfaction with the crowded 
conditions there. Thirty-six quads in 
the building will change to triples.
If Doherty residents would like to 
keep their room at the four-person 
level for next year, they will be per
mitted to do so. The retention of the 
room a the four-person occupancy will 
be permitted as a transitionary mea
sure only in this years Room Reser
vation Process, says a letter that 
will be sent to all residents of the 
building.
Room rates for the new Doherty 
triples will also be announced next 
week. Housing is looking to make 
their cost similar to Woodlawns onePlease see HOUSING, page 3
Tuition hike 
on the way
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Students will pay more to go 
to Carnegie Mellon this fall, 
with undergraduate tuition ris
ing from $16,960 to $17,900, a 
jump of $940 that is intended 
to cover inflation, boost finan
cial aid awards, and pay for 
additional academic and com
puting services.
The Board of Trustees last 
Monday authorized the five and 
a half percent undergraduate 
tuition increase and gave their 
permission for a similar in
crease in graduate tuition. 
Room and board costs will rise 
about three or four percent.
The increase in tuition was 
necessary because of rising ex
penses, said Jeffrey Bolton, 
assistant vice president for 
planning and budgets. Were 
looking at the expenses as 
theyre growing in the institu
tion, said Bolton, and were 
trying to maintain as low a [tu
ition] increase as possible. It 
settled down to five-and-a-half 
percent.
Just over half of the increase 
in undergraduate tuition will 
go to financial aid programs, 
with the rest of the additional 
money covering inflationary 
costs as well as increased costs 
for computing, laboratory, and 
classroom renovations, said 
Bolton.
Tuition is just one of the rev
enue streams we have in the 
total budget for the University. 
The senior administration 
evaluates the growth in ex
penses and growth in revenue 
and tries to match the two, 
said Bolton.
Money from tuition accounts 
for just about one-third of the 
Universitys $350 million bud

Students can ex
pect big changes on 
the Cut and around campus as a result 
ofthe upcoming demolition of Skibo and 
the beginning of construction on the new 
University Center.
The demolition, scheduled to begin 
shortly after commencement, will entail 
some changes in access to campus. The 
effects will reverberate along the length 
ofthe Cut, through the Universitys park
ing system, and into the lives of mem
bers of almost every student organiza
tion. But the planners of the project 
expect that the changes will have little, 
if any, negative overall effect.
The first visible changes will occur 
two days after commencement, when 
the building closes and asbestos removal 
begins. A six-foot chain link fence will be 
erected along the length of the eastern 
side ofthe cut, according to Kevin Lamb, 
director of planning services. It will cut 
off the sidewalk on that side of the Cut as 
well, since construction trucks servicing 
the site will need to drive along the 
reinforced sidewalk.
The idea, says Lamb, is to channel 
pedestrian traffic around the site. Part 
ofthat channelling of traffic will include 
several temporary walkways, opening 
as soon as they are needed. These ply
wood walkways will allow pedestrians 
to pass alongside the construction, both 
over a portion of the Gesling Stadium 
athletic field, and over a temporary ditch
which will be dug to connect an existing 
access tunnel running between Marga
ret Morrison Hall and West Wing to the 
construction site.
Another temporary walkway ramp, 
made of asphalt, will be added between 
Forbes Avenue and Warner Hall, allow
ing handicapped access to campus while 
the east end ofthe Cut is blocked off and 
the stairs in front of Warner Hall are 
repaired. This area also will be more 
thoroughly lit thail it is now. Plans call 
for the removal of this walkway at the 
completion of the University Center 
project.
One other permanent walkway will 
not open until August 1995. This as
phalt path will serve to directly connect
Margaret Morrison, West Wing, and 
Resnik to the Cut, as the sidewalk be
tween Skibo and the tennis courts does 
now.
All of the temporary and permanent 
walkways will be accessible to the handi
capped, says University Architect Paul 
Tellers.
Though the fencing and re-channeling 
of pedestrian traffic will completely close 
off the eastern side ofthe Cut, the tennis 
courts will remain open for the duration 
of the project, says Lamb.
Effects on campus parking will be 
minimal, except for the immediate loss 
of using the Skibo parking lot. The park
ing garage will remain open for the duPlease see DESTRUCTION, page 5
Over ABs objections...

Student Dormitory Council (SDC) voted 
Wednesday night to approve the spending of 
almost $28,000 in money returned by the cam
pus long-distance service, AT&T ACUS, after 
they overcharged students living in University 
Housing during the 1991-92 school year.
Of that total, $750 will be spent for program
ming, $1,200 will be spent for televisions and 
VCRs, $2,750 for recreational equipment, like 
pool and ping-pong tables, and $23,000 for a 35- 
mm movie projector and accompanying sound 
equipment for Doherty Hall 2210. That last item 
is causing the most controversy, especially among 
members of the Activities Board (AB).
Matt Adler, president of AB, said that the 
group never felt very involved in the process.
We knew it was coming to a vote. Were all
active members ofthe campus community, Adler 
said. ABs suggestions on alternative ways to 
spend the money were not given as much atten
tion as they should have been, he said.
Thirty five-mm projectors are wonderful, he 
said. But they already sell out their shows. 
Twenty-three thousand dollars would go a long 
way in the Gymnasium. Twenty-three thousand 
dollars would go a long way in housing improve
ments, from simple things like improving the 
Mudge kitchen or buying better lounge furni
ture.
There is currently a 16 mm projector in DH 
2210. If that projector were removed, than the 
format of ABs Thursday night films, which are 
usually older movies, not available in the larger 
format, would have to be altered. AB is worried 
that there is not enough space or ventilation for 
two projectors to fit in the current booth.

The Bull was taken from the hall
way in front , of the Hewlett Gallery 
Thursday night sometime between the 
hours of 11 pm and 7 am. No one. wit
nessed the actual theft, but according to 
Petra Fallaux, director of the Hewlett

Clinton decides on air strikes in Bosnia
WASHINGTON, February 18 (DJ) 
PresidentBill Clinton notified Con
gress today he was prepared to order 
bombing by U.S. warplanes in Bosnia, 
even as administration officials ex
pressed some optimism that air strikes 
could be averted.
All heavy weapons found within a
13-mile exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo that have not been surren
dered to the U.N. by 7 pm EST Sunday 
will be subject to NATO air strikes, 
Clinton told lawmakers.
The President planned to speak Sat
urday morning to give a status report 
on whether Bosnian Serbs are fully 
complying with the deadline.
Meanwhile, the administration wel
comed Russias role in pushingBosnian 
Serbs to move their artillery, and said 
400 Russian troops that might join 
peacekeeping efforts would be put 
under the control of the United Na
tions.
The White House voiced both hope 
and skepticism over reports that 
Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing their 
heavy equipment from hills around 
the Bosnian capital.
"The test will be their actions on the 
ground, White House press secretary 
Dee Dee Myers said. The test has not 
changed.
Neither will the NATO deadline, 
she and other administration officials 
emphasized.
Businesses support budget amendment
WASHINGTON, February 17 (DJ)
 The Business Roundtable, an asso
ciation of chief executives from more 
than 200 major corporations, urged 
the Senate to adopt a balanced budget 
amendment to the Constitution.
The Roundtables stance puts the 
influential group at loggerheads with 
the Clinton administration on two key 
issues on Capitol Hill this year. A few 
weeks ago the group dealt a blow to 
the Clinton health care reform plan, 
urging lawmakers to use as a starting 
point an alternative plan that would 
be less onerous to the business com
munity.
In testimony before Senator Paul 
Simon, (D-Ill.), John Snow, the chair
man and chief executive officer of CSX 
Corp. (CSX), said the Roundtable be
lieves the balanced budget amendment
would force Congress to close the an
nual budget gap.
Passage of the balanced budget 
amendment remains imperative to the 
long-term confidence and strength of 
the nations and, indeed, the global 
that capital markets, Snow said.
We certainly dont view the bal
anced budget amendment as a pana
cea for all the economic or political 
problems of this nation, and we agree 
that it should not be used as an excuse 
for inaction during the years ahead 
when [the amendment is] being rati
fied by the states, Snow said. It is, 
though, a critically important tool in 
the fight to reduce budget deficits and 
control the skyrocketing growth of our 
national debt.
Former Federal Reserve Chairman 
Paul Volcker opposes the proposal.
Court opens Packwood 
diaries to investigation
WASHINGTON, February 18 (DJ)
 A federal appeals court refused to
day to keep Senator Bob Packwoods 
diaries from the Senate Ethics Com
mittee while he appeals the panels 
subpoena.
The order means Packwoods dia
ries could be turned over to the com
mittee as early as Tuesday.
In a brief order, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit said Packwood has not satis
fied the stringent standards required 
for a stay pending appeal.
On February 7, U.S. District Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson set a 15-day 
timetable for transfer of the diaries to 
the committee investigating claims of 
sexual misconduct, witness intimida
tion and obstruction of the inquiry.
IRS makes deals with taxpayers
WASHINGTON, February 18 (DJ)  
Tax time is hard enough for most people, 
but even thinking about what you owe 
Uncle Sam can be almost too much to 
bear if you know you cant pay it. But for 
many people whose backs are against 
the wall, there is some good news: faced 
with an estimated 7.5 million Ameri
cans who should but dont file income 
tax returns, the Internal Revenue Ser
vice is increasingly willing to make a 
deal, The Wall Street Journal reported.
I feel the pressure is gone, and I can 
start living again, says Dawn Moton, a 
50-year-old computer specialist from 
Columbus, Ohio. Last November, she 
settled an IRS claim of $124,000 in taxes 
and penalties for $14,000.
I had to prove I couldnt take out a 
loan on my life insurance and that I 
didnt have a 401 (k) plan to take money 
out of, she says. But it was worth it.
Moton, who found herself in trouble 
because of bad tax-shelter investments, 
made use of an IRS procedure called an 
offer-in-compromise. Such offers are 
for people who have racked up large tax 
delinquencies and have dim hopes of 
ever getting the money to pay the IRS.
For many other taxpayers, the IRS 
has a simpler procedure that allows use 
of installment payments. In the fiscal 
year that ended September 30,1993,2.5 
million Americans paid their taxes by 
installment agreement, almost double 
the number in fiscal 1992.
If your tax bill is under $10,000, and 
you cant pay it, all you have to do is fill 
out one-page Form 9465, Installment 
Agreement Request, and attach it to 
your tax return; the IRS promises to 
respond within 30 days. If you owe more 
than $10,000, youll have to fill out a 
financial statement, and provide more 
documentation.
The IRS usually allows payments to 
go on for two or three years if the tax 
owed is under $10,000, accountants say. 
The IRS says the average installment 
deal runs one to one and a half years.
When you pay in installments, inter
est and penalties on the unpaid tax con
tinue to accumulate. Interest currently 
runs seven percent annually, and then 
there is the late penalty, which is 0.5 
percent a month, for a total of 13 per
cent. The penalty for not filing an in
come tax form is five percent a month up 
to a total maximum of 25 percent.
Because of the costs, it may make 
more sense for taxpayers who can do so 
to get a less expensive home-equity loan 
or to borrow against stocks and bonds. 
Youre usually better off that way, says 
Robert A. LaBaube, director ofIRS Prob
lem Resolution for accountants Coopers
& Lybrand in Washington.
But if your back taxes are so large that
youre never going to be able to pay them 
off, its worthwhile filing for an offer-incompromise. The number of offers filed 
increased to 40,843 in the first 10 months 
of the 1993 fiscal year, more than double 
the number filed in all of fiscal 1992.
According to the IRS, you generally 
have more than a 50-50 chance of get
ting your offer approved. But acceptance 
rates vary widely among the IRSs 63 
districts, according to IRS figures pro
vided for the General Accounting Office. 
For example, the IRS office in Laguna 
Niguel, Calif., accepted only 17 percent 
of offers in fiscal 1993, while the IRS 
office in Boise, Idaho, accepted 79 per
cent.
Why the big difference? David Keating, 
executive vice president of the National 
Taxpayers Union, says its because local 
IRS offices develop their own culture 
and dont necessarily follow national IRS 
policy to the degree that Washington 
wants.
The IRS says the difference reflects 
variations of the quality of taxpayer 
offers in different regions.
How much the IRS will settle for also 
varies, depending on the individual case.
Clinton reverses minority policy
WASHINGTON, February 18 (DJ)  
The Clinton administration, reversing a 
Bush administration policy, said col
leges and universities may target schol
arships to minorities to promote campus 
diversity or make up for past discrimi
nation, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The Bush administration had proposed 
sharply limiting the extent to which 
race can be the basis for awarding schol
arships. Specifically, it proposed allow
ing race-targeted scholarships only in 
cases where there are formal findings of 
discrimination by a court, legislative 
body, or the Justice Department. In ad
dition, it said race should only be one of 
several eligibility criteria for scholar
ships designed to promote diversity.
The new Clinton policy allows schools 
to act on their own, provided they have 
substantial evidence of discrimination, 
said Judith Winston, general council of 
the Education Department. And it al
lows colleges to use race as the deciding 
factor in awarding scholarships designed 
to promote diversity  provided they 
prove that other, less-intrusive meth
ods of achieving diversity would be inef
fective.
Critics say race-targeted scholarships 
give minorities an unfair advantage. 
Race-targeted scholarships, like racial 
quotas, are illegal except under very 
limited circumstances, said Richard 
Komer, who was the Education 
Departments deputy assistant secre
tary for civil rights in the Bush adminis
tration. For instance, he said, race-tar
geted scholarships should be confinedto! 
countering recent discrimination.
Komer faulted the Clinton adminj?. 
tration for allowing colleges to target 
scholarship money to specific minority 
groups to achieve diversity. He suggested 
that gets dangerously close to establish, 
ing racial quotas, which he said would 
be illegal.
Because of their unique circumstances 
the 116 historically black colleges may 
put up some of their own money toward 
racially targeted scholarships in con
junction with private or other thirdparty donors, the Education Department 
said.
Treasurer pleads guilty years later
WASHINGTON, February 18 (DJ)- 
Former U.S. Treasurer Catalina 
Vasquez Villalpando pleaded guilty to 
obstructing an independent counsels 
probe into corruption at the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, 
The Wall Street Journal reported.
She also pleaded guilty to Justice De
partment charges oftax evasion andnot 
disclosing, to Congress and the Trea
sury Department, income from her 
former, private employer while she was 
treasurer. Villalpando admitted conceal
ing income from her previous employer, 
information that may have been rel
evant to her government service. She 
didnt report $167,901 in 1989 taxable 
income, or pay $47,013 taxes on it.
In the independent counsel case, 
Villalpando, who was treasurer in the 
Bush administration from 1989 until 
January 1993, had documents destroyed 
after they were subpoenaed by a federal 
grand jury. This one-count felony con
viction carries a penalty of up to five 
years imprisonment and a maximum 
fine of $250,000.
The tax evasion and nondisclosure 
convictions carry possible penalties of 
10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
She remains free until sentenced later 
this year. Villalpandos plea brings the 
number of convictions related to the 
Reagan-era HUD scandal to 12. The 
corruption included bribery and issuing 
HUD contracts on the basis of political 
favoritism. Several high-ranking former 
HUD officials have been convicted, in
cluding three who were top assistants to 
former Secretary Samuel Pierce and 
three former assistant secretaries. Pierce 
hasnt been charged.

Artwork stolen from CFA discovered in Donner basement
NO BULL, from page 1
The Bull was created by Chris 
Siefert, a graduate student in 
Fine Arts and was put on as part 
of an exhibition that Siefert was 
holding with a another CFA stu
dent. While the exhibition lacked 
a specific theme, it was intended 
0 give the artists a chance to 
exhibit some recent work.
The artwork itself is seven feet 
long and four feet high and was 
made from one-and-a-quarter
inch plywood and was designed 
so that the legs would interlock 
with the body. You can take it 
apart, said Siefert. The thing 
was pretty heavy. I would say it 
was about 100 pounds.
The artwork was not an assign
ment but was going to be used as 
part of Sieferts portfolio, which 
is important to an artist, he said.
The Bull was not the only 
thing that was taken that night. 
An 18-inch chalice was also sto
len. It was returned the next day, 
but broken. This was not the first 
incident involving the sculpture, 
Siefert said. [On the first night it 
was out] it was turned over and 
stuff was put on it, he said.
CFA is not locked during the 
night so that the building is ac
cessible to the students who need 
to use the studios. According to 
Fallaux, Artists work late hours 
and they need CFA open 24 
hours. There is also no 24-hour
security watch that patrols the 
Gallery. There is the normal 
watch that goes through all open 
buildings at night, but no secu
rity guard.
I dont have the budget or 
money to put on a 24-hour watch, 
she said. If artwork is out there, 
it should be respected.
To assist in his search, Siefert 
made up signs with a picture of 
The Bull and asking for any 
information that would lead to
its return.
The sculpture was discovered 
at 3:10 pm on Saturday. It 
seemed to just show up, said 
Sergeant Richard Sima of Cam
pus Police. The custodian imme
diately contacted Campus Police, 
who brought it back to their store
room.
It doesnt appear to be dam
aged, said Sima. The theft of the 
art would be classified as a mis
demeanor. He doesnt see any for
mal charges being made, It most 
likely will be dealt with inter
nally, unless the artists wants to 
pursue it further. The police do 
intend to pursue a number of 
leads.
Siefert was happy to hear about 
his artworks recovery.
This is a big relief to know that 
its been found. he said. Im very 
upset with the people who took it 
and I would like to know who it
CMU housing alternatives change
HOUSING, from page 1
bedroom, three-person apartments, 
which was $3,950 for the 1993-94 aca
demic year.
Housing will continue to lease 
Marybelle Apartments for 1994-95, and 
residents can participate in the regular 
room reservation process. Potter said 
that Housing has always looked to have 
our off-campus housing as close to main 
campus as possible. Cathedral Man
sions is located on Ellsworth Avenue in 
Oakland, around the corner from 
Webster Hall. The building currently 
has about 200 apartments occupied by 
non-students. The CMU shuttle will take 
students directly to the door.
CMU is leasing a portion of the rooms 
directly from the Mansions. Potter de
scribed the facility as roomy and wellmaintained. Floor plans of the building 
will be distributed to all residents of 
Carol and Tudor, and an informational 
letter will be distributed to residents of 
Carol, Tudor, Doherty, and Marybelle.
Tim Foster, assistant director of Hous
ing for Residence Life, said the arrange
ment breaks up the communal aspect of
dorm life, as residents will be scattered 
all over the new building instead of be
ing on the same hall or floor. Resident 
Assistants (RAs) will also be placed-in 
the Mansions.
All residents planning to stay in uni
versity housing next year should be pre
paring for the reservation process soon. 
Students who are looking for housing 
off-campus that is not University Hous
ing can talk to the Referral Service of
fered through the Housing office.
A $100 deposit should be paid to the 
Cashiers Office by February 24 in order 
to indicate that you are interested in 
selecting housing space. Details for the 
rest of the process are available in a

TUITION, from page 1 its like, so they go to state schools and able to attend this school, said EricTUITION, from page 1
ing from research grants.
Some students are tired of the con
stantly rising tuition rates  the Uni
versity has raised tuition every year 
since 1975. I dont think tuition should 
be continually increasing faster than 
inflation. I dont think the changes Ive 
seen since Ive been here justify such 
high increases in tuition, said senior 
computer science major Kevin Cooney.
Other students believe the cost of 
tuition is already high enough. Im 
against a tuition increase. From what 
Ive seen on campus, the school can 
quite easily survive without raising 
tuition. Tuition should go up overtime, 
but six percent a year? Every year? 
said John Prevost, a freshman in the 
university choice program. There are 
a lot of bright kids out there who cant 
afford this kind of school without a lot 
of aid, and theyre the people who are 
afraid theyll put themselves helplessly 
into debt. Theyve lived in poor fami
lies their entire lives. They know what
its like, so they go to state schools and 
get educations that will keep them 
from going any lower than their par
ents, at the very least... Ive sold my 
soul to go to this school, and I hope it 
pays off, said Prevost.
University administrators say 
theyre aware of these problems. Ac
cording to Admissions Director Mike 
Steidel, Theres no question about it. 
College cost is the single most impor
tant factor affecting families [deci
sions]. The total cost, the sticker price, 
is what students are concerned with.
He hopes to counter the potential 
negative impact of higher tuition lev
els by restructuring the way the ad
missions office interacts with prospec
tive freshman. Now, were askingthem 
point-blank: what are your require
ments?
The requirement for some current 
students is simple: more financial aid, 
or they wont be able to stay at Carnegie 
Mellon. If tuition increases and my 
financial aid doesnt, then I will not be
able to attend this school, said Eric 
Stuckey, a freshman computer science 
major. The increase in tuition wouldnt 
directly make me consider other 
schools, because I qualify for so much 
financial aid. However, there are state 
schools which are much cheaper, and I 
almost went to a state school for that 
very reason, he said.
Steidel said the administration un
derstands students misgivings about 
increased tuition costs, especially the 
concerns of incoming students who may 
compare Carnegie Mellon to much 
cheaper schools like Penn State or 
Rutgers.
Were in the range right now where 
people are very sensitive to college 
costs. Our biggest fear is that people 
will opt out to public institutions. When
ever the price goes up, it magnifies 
those possibilities, he said. Its the 
cost and the magnetism  how good a 
fit the school is  that makes a family 
decide is it worth it. If the magnetism 
is so great, people will pay the price.

Ex-Officio Reports:
AB (Matt Adler): Movies:
Thursday, Bad Lieutenant; Fri
day, Carlitos Way; Sunday, Blitz
krieg Pop. Barbara Bailey Hutch
inson was great last week. The 
Mighty Bosstones were very suc
cessful. Were working on Carni
val arrangements. Were startmg a college bowl. Tournaments 
will be March 12 in BH 235A and 
B - Sign up forms are at Skibo Info 
Desk.
GSO (Tim Mallo): A GSO rep 
met with the PSAC. The Univer
sity Structure Meeting was dis
cussed and it was very produc
tive. The President discussed the 
policy and practice on school clos
ing and tuition fees. The Presi
dent announced the commence
ment speaker. A GSO rep met 
with the VPS AC. The new Uni
versity Center was discussed in 
regard to the GSO bookstore com
mittee report and the relocation 
of the Tilted Square.
Student Affairs (Pat Hamed): 
A program called the Gathering 
Storr, sponsored by Residence 
Life will be Thursday, February
17, at 8 pm in the Donner Read
ing Room.
SDC (Ben Wang): Movie on 
Saturday is My Life. SDC recom
mends a referendum regarding 
the plus/minus grading system. 
The ACUS funds willbe allocated 
for a film projector and various 
things for the dorms such as pool 
tables and ping pong.
President (Dave Wolpert): I 
vetoed the plus/minus grading 
resolution for four reasons: 1) Stu
dents opposed it; 2) It will in
crease academic pressure in an 
already stressful environment; 3) 
It takes some subjectivity away 
from professors; 4) The lack of a 
grandfather clause.
I dont think a referendum will 
work since we havent had ad
equate turnout or response in the 
past.
Treasurer (Declan McCullagh): Well be approving one or
two Treasurers aides tonight. Es
timates of our current finances 
based on predicted enrollment for 
1993-4 and expected Activities 
Fee revenue: amount paid to Sen
ate after GSO takes their por

subsidies given to organizations: 
$76,000; amount left after spe
cial allocations to date: $51,000; 
amount left after deducting loan 
to WRCT: $25,000.
Committee Reports:
Academic Affairs (Dawn 
Wallhausen): This semester we 
worked on the library issue. Were 
still working on improving regis
tration, computer issues, and 
plus/minus grading. I recommend 
that Senators listen to their con
stituents, be open to suggestions, 
and work with other committees.
Campus Affairs (Cheryl 
Gach): I just started three weeks 
ago, but some issues we worked 
on were: library hours issue, de
fining the campus community, 
increase in athletic spirit, the 
smell in Skibo, recycling on cam
pus, the gym committee, and se
curity improvements. Some rec
ommendations I have: We need 
lots of people on committees to 
get more done; we need to work 
with other committees and the 
student body. Some projects Id 
like to work on next semester: 
lighting in Doherty Hall and se
curity issues.
Funding and Recognition
(Crystal Trexel): I started in No
vember. We recognized four clubs 
and gave special allocations to
many. Weve had problems with 
the committee shrinking due to 
turnover. Im hoping the budget 
process will go smoothly. We may 
start rolling over budgets at the 
end of the semester. We have two 
recognitions tonight for the Gun 
Club and Hemp Awareness. Bud
get disks are due back on Febru
ary 18.
Human Resources (Moneet 
Singh): Weve done Senate fold
ers, the database system, and en
hanced the historical value of the 
files. We want to reexamine the 
files, continue the database, and 
use the post evaluation forms for 
future reference.
We want our files to be avail
able to other organizations on 
Andrew for their own use and to 
increase awareness of what hap
pens in Senate. Thank you to my 
committee for all your help and 
hard work.
Public Relations (Jim Albert): 
We got the results from Food for 
Thought compiled. Weve worked 
hard on both elections and started 
some new methods: banners, ra
dio announcements, and videos 
before Doherty movies. Thanks 
to my committee.
Chair (Burt Holzman): Its 
been a tough semester with two 
elections and many controversial 
issues. Well have bylaw and con
stitutional amendments coming

SDC ready to 
spend rebate
SDC, from page 1
Scott Curtin, president of SDC, 
said that the proposal to spend 
the money was split into four 
separate parts so that SDC mem
bers could vote on each use indi
vidually.
There was a lot of discussion 
on the whole topic, said Curtin. 
Each part passed individually. 
Curtin said that a number of 
members of AB attended the 
meeting. They were basically 
interested in finding out some 
specific [answers], he said. They 
wanted to know about repairs, 
getting [the projector] into the 
booth, and space requirements. 
There were also a number of 
people there from the general 
public. Someone came to show 
his support for more pool tables, 
he said.
Curtin said that most of the 
improvements to be made with 
the ACUS money will happen 
fairly quickly.
The money is already sitting 
in our account, he said. Motions 
have been made for the TVs and 
recreational equipment already. 
Were going out this Saturday 
(February 19) to look at getting 
some of the recreational equip
ment, TVs, and VCRs.
Because the new projector will 
require some modifications to be 
made to the DH 2210 projection 
booth, its installation will have to 
be approved by the University, 
said Curtin.
Anything that they do to the 
booth will be detrimental to the 
mechanics of showing the films, 
said Adler. Its going to be a pain 
in our ass, and a pain in the ass of 
the projectionists.
There should be enough space 
to fit everything in there easily, 
said Curtin. He said that the 35 
mm projector will improve the 
quality and timeliness of the 
movies shown. Well receive 
movies sooner, he said. Plus, 
the quality equals that which is 
shown in theaters.
I think we get great movies 
now, said Adler. I think people 
go to our movies because of the 
content of the movie, not the for
mat its shown in.
Adler said that most people 
would not notice the change. I 
think that they got real excited 
about projectors, they found a 
way to spend a real great chunk 
of the money, and thats what 
theyre doing. Im just upset that 
AB is kind of being pushed aside, 
he said.
We want to get back together 
with AB on this, said Curtin, 
and get things worked out in 
that area. We want to have good 
relations with them.
Demolition will alter campus

ration of the project, with no 
restriction of traffic volume, ac
cording to project coordinator 
Tom Murphy of the Physical 
. Plant. According to both Lamb 
and Murphy, traffic flow may 
be restricted to one-way traffic 
through the garage, though that 
is a detail that has not yet been 
worked out by the parking 
office.There will be the same 
access to the garage as there is 
today, says Tellers.
Student Activities will be mov
ing to the now-vacant Naval Re
serve Building on Forbes Av
enue. Renovations are proceed
ing on schedule to prepare the
building for the organizations, 
which will be moving in late 
April. There will be another, 
optional date for organizations 
to relocate, after commence
ment, says Lamb. So far, we 
are not anticipating any delays 
[in the renovations], so the or
ganizations should be able to 
move on schedule.
Lambs only worry is that 
there may be a problem with 
radon in the building. There 
were two areas that had radon. 
It wasnt terribly serious, but it 
was enough that something had 
to be done. The problem must 
be fixed by the Navy, or its sub
contractors, before the move can
occur. Thats the only wild card 
that concerns me right now, 
says Lamb.
The only other difficulty in 
the Naval Reserve Building in
volves the area that has been 
earmarked for CMAPs new per
manent location. That requires 
a great deal of renovation, says 
Lamb.
One last question that has 
arisen about the move to the 
Naval Reserve Building is the 
current lack of campus network 
hardwiring. Lamb says that the 
process of networking the build
ing will be completed in time to 
be useful to student organiza
tions.
New center gets 
mixed reactions
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan News'Editor
The University unveiled the 
Naval Reserve Center Thursday 
to representatives of the organi
zations that will be moving into 
the building when Skibo Hall is 
demolished to make way for the 
new University Center.
Some people seem really 
pleased, said Bonnie Gorman, 
assistant director of Student Ac
tivities. Other people will have 
to make adjustments.
Were really happy to have 
space at all, said Greg Nelson, 
president of the Celtic Society, 
because we didnt before.
Its comparable to what we 
have now. In fact, its a little 
bigger, and we have a window, 
said The Thistle's Editor-in-Chief 
Moneet Singh. Its probably bet
ter than our space in the new 
University Center. In general, its 
better than not having anywhere 
to work.
The Thistle and The Tartan will 
be sharing a darkroom now, but 
Singh said that he didnt feel that 
it would cause a problem. I think 
we can manage. I think the two 
organizations will work out bet
ter together, he said.
Scott Curtin, president of Stu
dent Dormitory Council, said that 
SDCs new offices are small. 
Its smaller than what we have 
now, said Curtin. The best sce
nario would be trying to find some 
extra space, but if we have to 
make it work, we have to. Its as 
wide as our office is now, but we 
lose about half the floor space, if 
not more.
[We have] one thats not big 
enough, said Fred Trudwig, 
president of Alpha Phi Omega. 
We have the office and a store
room right now. [In the Naval 
Reserve Center] both APhiO and 
SDC are in an area that we both
occupy by ourselves, plus the stuff 
in our storeroom, so its going to 
be crowded as it is.
Its better than what we have 
now, which is nothing, said 
Girvan Calder, president of the 
National Society of Black Engi
neers. We need office space, es
pecially with the national con
vention [of NSBE] which is in 
town this year. NSBE will be 
sharing an office with Spirit and 
the Graduate Student Organiza
tion.
The space is nice, said Jaya 
Krishna, an officer of Mayur. 
Well be sharing it with one other 
organization, and it seems a bit 
small now, but its a plus for us. 
Weve been asking for space for 
some time.
Its a good news/bad news situ
ation for AB Tech, said Christa 
Houlihan of the group. Its big
ger than the space we haVe now. 
Im rather happy with that. But 
Im not sure that well be able to 
move all of our bigger equipment 
down there [to the Drill Deck].
In addition, all of the different 
groups that make up AB, includ
ing AB Tech, will be sharing an 
office.
Curtin said that one of the big 
drawbacks of the building is the 
loss of big assembly areas like the 
Skibo Ballroom, the Wherrett 
Room, and Grey Matter.
The meeting rooms [in the 
Naval Center] seem comparable, 
but were losing a big area like 
the Ballroom, said Curtin. 
[Room 180] could be used for our 
Wednesday night meeting. But if 
large meetings come on top of 
each other, well only have one 
room where large meetings can 
be held.
Mostly, its different, said 
Gorman. When youre thinking 
about the University Center and 
here, its change, and change is 
hard for everybody.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
City cracks down on illegal parking
The Pittsburgh city police have informed 
CMU police that they are going to crack 
down on illegal parking on Frew Street. 
Recently, they have been receiving numer
ous complaints about people parking their 
cars in the no parking (fire lane) and in 
dangerous places on Frew Street.
From now on, Pittsburgh Police will begin 
ticketing cars that are illegally parked in 
the parking zones and fire lanes. These 
automobiles will also be subject to towing
and the fees that are attached to the tow
ing. Parking fees can be 40 dollars for 
illegal parking. 85 dollars is the cost if the 
car is towed. If a car is not picked up on the 
day that it is towed, there will be an addi
tional 25 dollars added daily for storage 
fees.
Campus Police have stated that the prob
lem can be avoided. Most university park
ing lots, after 4:30 pm, are open for no 
charge. Also, metered parking spaces owned 
by the University are also free.

Potential Senate split 
would harm students
Recently, in Student Senate 
elections, graduate students 
won many of the seats avail
able. While we think great de
termination and solidarity, we 
do have some concerns.
Last semester, we saw the 
graduate students try to attain 
seats in order for them to get a 
larger share of the Activities 
Fee. They also talked about split
ting and forming their own gov
ernment. A split concerns us 
the most. Essentially, the stu
dents in favor of the split want 
two Student Senates: one for 
graduate students and one for 
undergraduates. We feel that a 
split of the Student Senate 
would detrimental to student 
morale as well as to the univer
sity as a whole.
Malting the graduate students 
sovereign over their activities 
fees would cause problems for 
almost every organization on 
campus. Many organizations 
have both undergraduate and 
graduate participants. If these 
organizations were funded by 
only the undergraduate senate, 
would graduate students be 
barred from the membership? 
Likewise, if only the graduate 
senate gave funds to a particu
lar organization, would 
undergrads be barred from par
ticipation?
Of course, there is the possi
bility that both senates would 
grant funds to the same organi
zations. This would just create 
more work, bureaucracy, and
confusion. Any group request
ing funds from both Senates 
would have to go through twice 
the amount of work to receive 
the same amount of money.
Aside from financial dilem
mas, a split senate would not do 
any wonders for the already 
tense relationship between 
graduate and undergraduate 
students.
Splitting the Senate would 
only create more disunity on 
campus. All of CMUs students 
share the same facilities; they 
ought to be able to cooperate in 
the governing of them.
The election of graduate stu
dents to the Senate seems to be 
an on going topic of concern. We 
think it might notbeabadidea, 
to deal with the situation once 
and for all, that graduate and 
undergraduate students be al
located a proportional number 
of seats on the senate just like 
the different colleges have. With 
a campus already divided as a 
result of the diverse colleges, 
there is no need for the under
graduates and graduates to get 
involved in a power struggle.
Once again, we applaud the 
new senators and their initia
tive in getting elected and also 
the students who turned out to 
vote for them.
We do hope our other sugges
tions lead to a stronger sense of 
campus community and unity, 
rather than the us against 
them attitude that seems to be 
the norm.
New Senators must 
change old patterns
Two weeks ago, approximately 
10 percent of the student body 
went to the polls in a second 
attempt to hold the fall election 
for Student Senate. We hope 
that the controversy surround
ing the elections has subsided, 
and that the new Senators will 
be able to focus on the tasks at 
hand shortly. With that in mind, 
we would like to offer the follow
ing suggestions to the new Stu
dent Senate.
All Senators should wear uni
forms and funny hats.
Make yourselves known to 
your constituency. Email them 
and tell them who you are! Send 
them a letter, saying that you 
represent them, and give them 
ways that they can contact you.
We suggest that a booklet, a 
Senate Directory, be created 
with general information about 
Student Government, its role in 
student life, and its operation! 
It should contain the names of 
all of the Student Senators, the 
college each represents, and 
their office hours, and be dis
tributed to the student body.
We would also like Student 
Senate to create a mission state
ment and a set of goals and 
principles that the body will 
strive to uphold. Why shouldnt 
Senate adhere to Total Quality 
Management (TQM) like the 
rest of the University?
We know that student inter
est in Senate activities is low. It 
doesnt have to be. Senators 
should constantly be striving to
Letters to the Editor

Leiter lo I he Editor
Letter to 
the Editor
reach their constituents in new 
and inventive ways. Perhaps if 
more people knew how Senate 
was affecting them, they 
wouldnt be so apathetic about 
getting involved.
And regarding representing 
ones constituents, each Sena
tor should be actively pursuing 
students opinions. Become the 
true voice of the student body. 
Let everyone feel that they do 
have a voice in campus current 
events.
Dont ignore the people who 
were involved in your campaign 
to get elected. Contact the people 
who signed your petition, and 
let them know how and what 
youre doing.
So often, we hear nothing but 
negative, unconstructive views 
from Senators and students on 
the role of Senate.
Instead of talking about how 
students really dont care about 
whats going on, lets give stu
dents a reason to care. Perhaps 
its time to stop complaining and 
griping and start working to 
make a positive statement about 
the continuing role that Stu
dent Senate plays. Maybe the 
uniforms and the silly hats 
wouldnt help, but we would ask 
new and old Senators not to 
wait for their constituency  
bring yourselves to them.
Lets shift the focus of Senate 
from the passive to the active, 
from the reactionary to the vi
sionary, and from the pass to 
the vital. Thats as it should be.

In response to last 
weeks article [Email 
communication lacks 
personal touch, 2/
141, Id like to express 
my disagreement with the generaliza
tion of impersonal email. While I do 
agree that any sort of relationship should 
not be based on email alone, it is possible 
to communicate a personality through 
email.
Of course, this depends on who sends 
the email. Those of us who type email 
like we would a final paper, proofread
ing twice before sending it, definitely 
add support for Mahua Duttas allega
tion. However, it is possible to give any 
writing a personal touch.
I have been told numerous times that 
when reading my email, my friends can 
actually hear me because the message 
replicateshowlspeakandactinperson. 
Stammers and sighs are a part of many 
messages. A well placed uh ... um ... 
yeah, thats it or *sigh* classes suck 
can add much more meaning than Yes, 
I understand, or Classes are not going 
very well. Silences can be symbolized 
by a sequence of periods (...) combined 
with several blank lines. In regard to 
spontaneity, I know many people who 
tend to be more spontaneous when writ
ing email, since you arent as concerned 
with the reactions of a person right in 
front of you.
Again, I do stress the importance of 
personal interaction, but I dont think 
that the personal aspects of email should 
be underestimated.

I am very disap

While there are situations in which

must be applied carefully lest the paper 
lose respect as a forum for expressing 
intelligent opinions about important is

cludes the following: Letters to the Edi

will be withheld upon request. When a 
letter is printed without the authors 
name, one must assume that the letter 
expresses the opinion of the editorial

writing an editorial column, the editor 
may be hoping to enhance the credibility 
of the opinion. Whether or not such abuse

Greek event 
excluded no one
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I would like to re
spond to the letter by 
Declan McCullagh 
and Donna Riley in 
last weeks Tartan 
[Greek event excludes queers, 2/14]. I 
found their whole argument absurd. 
They claimed that by providing a s ervice 
of Hugs, Slaps, and Kisses, which was 
delivered by males to females (or vice 
versa) that the organizations involved 
were acting in a manner exclusionary to 
homosexuals. I have a couple of objec
tions to their premise which I would like 
to discuss.
Firstly, are all those in the queer com
munity so hetero-phobic as to not be able 
to accept a kiss from a member of the 
opposite sex? The service was explicitly 
described in the fliers as to the manner 
in which the delivery would be done. 
Would a homosexual individual be so 
revolted to be kissed by a member of the 
opposite sex, even when it was an act 
instigated by their own lover, and they 
understood the spirit in which it was 
given? This seems like an extremely 
intolerant attitude.
Secondly the service was just that, a 
service. No compulsion was involved, 
and the terms were plainly announced. 
Would one go down to the Pittsburgh 
Steak House, demand a vegetarian dish, 
and be upset if they didnt have it? Would 
someone rant and rave if McDonalds 
wouldnt serve them Lobster Thermidor? 
One could very easily understand the 
nature of the service offered, and if a 
different service is wanted, one could 
either find someone else to provide it, or 
do without. The Greek organizations 
were providing a service of their own 
volition, they have no obligation to per
form acts which someone else deems 
desirable if they disagree.
I would put forth that the writers 
whole attitude was inflammatory and 
intended to cause a stir. They knew 
what they were getting into, and I would 
bet the response is exactly what was 
expected. I find it rather immature of 
them to make a big deal out of something 
which is such a harmless non-issue as 
this.

Editor:
I was confused after 
reading last weeks 
letter [Greek event 
excludes queers, 2/
14] which criticized 
me and Pi Kappa Alpha because of what 
seemed like exclusion of the homosexual 
community in our charitable event, 
Hugs, Slaps and Kisses. Our purpose 
was not to exclude anyone but to raise 
money for Childrens Cancer Charities.
First, I was never aware that my re
sponse to the request to have a brother 
of Pi Kappa Alpha deliver a kiss to an
other man would be taken out of context
and printed in an effort to smear both 
my name and the name of Pi Kappa 
Alpha, let alone the image of the entire 
Greek system. When I was contacted by 
a man who identified himself as Mark, I 
responded with my sense of how his idea 
would not work now that the event was 
already under way. I did not feel that it 
would be fair, or even feasible, to make 
changes after the event had already be
gun.
Our intent was not to exclude anyone, 
but to do the best we could to help raise 
money for the charity. I apologize, both 
for myself and on behalf of Pi Kappa 
Alpha, for not being able to accommo
date the needs of everyone interested in 
contributing to our cause. I was more 
concerned at the time with raising money 
for Childrens Cancer Charities than 
with a political issue. If the idea of dis
crimination had been presented earlier, 
perhaps the logistics of the event could 
have been changed in time; however, it 
was not, and I hope that better planning 
in the future will allow us to avoid ex
cluding anyone from contributing.

Though Jason 
Speclands column 
[Our generation 
fails to rediscover 
60s idealism, 2/7] is 
interesting and well-written, it suffers 
from an almost laughably naive reading 
of cultural trends surrounding activism 
in the last 30 years or so.
He points to college students history 
as activists. He says we owe to 1960s 
students the fact that we can protest on 
campus, hand out literature, and say 
just about whatever the heck we please 
without fear. Though this is true to a 
certain extent, its only one side of a 
definitely two-sided coin.
The fact that we can do all these things 
goes hand in hand with the fact that 
they are utterly meaningless to many 
members of our generation. I dont know 
about you, but I have seen the films and 
heard the songs so many times that 
theyre funny at best. More importantly, 
the minor revolts that took place in the 
1960s taught the government and other 
large corporations (like Carnegie Mellon) 
how to effectively manage dissent. If 
they create a legal outlet for it (which 
they have done), they defang it. They 
undermine the revolutionary spirit by 
making room for it in the structure.
Our generation can hardly be called 
traitor to the last. Its foolish to think 
that 1960s political tactics would work 
today. Ifyoure interested in seeing some 
of the new tactics, send away for a couple 
of fanzines, go to a Womens Center 
Collective meeting, or listen to WRCT. 
The fact that the spirit isnt readily 
visible doesnt mean that its dead. In 
fact, it might mean that its more alive 
than ever.

Tradition programs, controls individuals
Matt Ball
When I got married a year ago, I found 
myself faced with many ideas of tradition. 
The word tradition has positive connota
tions, implying a regard for the ways of 
ancestors, an esteem for how things were 
done in the past. Many men spend two 
months salary to purchase a tiny stone 
because of tradition. When married, a 
woman drops her name and takes the 
mans because of tradition.
In spite of the many social movements in 
the past century, society still indoctri
nates children with values dependent upon 
gender. Males are generally taught to be 
more aggressive and independent, to base 
their self-esteem on personal achievement. 
Females are more frequently taught, sub
tly or overtly, to take a secondary role, to 
judge themselves by their physical attrac
tiveness. These attitudes continue to per
meate the etiquette of interaction between 
the sexes throughout adult life. Despite the 
impact of the feminist movement in recent 
decades, chivalry still exists and is widely 
accepted, even expected, by many men and 
women.
Since so many facets of our lives are sim
ply programmed responses rather than in
dependently formed decisions, it is hard to 
believe we are beings with free will. In spite 
of the tremendous cultural changes wrought 
by technological advances, the pattern of 
successive generations is remarkably simi
lar to those of their parents. How many of us 
believe in the god of our parents, and their 
parents before, as if our family line has a 
monopoly on the nature of the universe? 
How many of us had prayers drilled into us 
so often that we can recite them without any 
thought as to what they were supposed to 
mean? How many of us spent years learning 
the names of every President and the dates 
of past battles (even when new ones raged 
unquestioned)? How many of us will go 
through the expected amount of school to get 
a nine-to-five job for the next 40 or 50 years?
As if we would starve to death other
wise, we acquire wealth and security 
as we acquire years, leaving for our 
survivors the material possessions ac
cumulated over decades and a scrap
book of photos which, except for the 
faces, could be interchanged with those 
of any number of families. When time 
runs out, thousands of dollars are spent 
to house our lifeless forms in carved 
mahogany boxes buried beneath en
graved stone markers. The money spent 
does not show any respect for the memory 
of the deceased, and could in fact be put 
to constructive use, but tradition has its 
demands. The sanctity of the dead out
weighs the needs of the living.
Our existence has become a mindless 
routine. We allow ourselves to be ab
sorbed into some collective amoeba 
rather than taking the opportunity to 
examine and judge our own lives and 
react accordingly. Few ever try to see 
beyond the constraints imposed by pre
vious generations, to explore options be
sides those given societal approval. Our
sense of morality, our daily patterns, 
our interactions with other people and 
animals  whom we ogle, whom we 
hate, whom we keep as pets, whom we 
eat  have been pinned to us in assem
bly-line fashion. We have become living 
exercises in mass-production.
While the process of life itself has 
proven resilient and perhaps unending, 
our individual lives are not. Each of us 
has a relatively short span of time to 
discover and experience our unique ex
istence. We can decide for ourselves what 
course our lives will take and what is the - 
proper way to interact with our sur
roundings. Doing so in the face of so 
much cultural momentum can be in
timidating, since most people regard 
such individualism with indifference at 
best. But to ignore the challenge is noth
ing less than tragic.

UJjs
Ronak Singhal
Lorena Bobbitt said that she 
did what she had to do because 
she was a victim. Two teenagers 
who died this past fall laid down 
in the middle of a road because of 
a movie scene. A five-year-old 
burned down a trailer because of 
a cartoon show. What do all three 
ofthese well-publicized incidents 
have in common? They reflect the 
general mindset of people today 
refusing to take responsibility for 
themselves and their actions.
Take the Bobbitt case, for ex
ample. Lorena Bobbitt says that 
her act was merely self-defense 
after years of being battered by 
her husband. But at no time did 
she ever try to get away from him 
or seek help. Now, once put on 
trial, she pleads temporary in
sanity and claims that it was a 
moment of rage and self-defense. 
She refuses to accept the respon
sibility for her action, even though 
she has never shown any signs of 
mental illness, and is a business
professional.
This denial of responsibility is 
a cancer that is eating away at 
the moral fiber of America and is 
destroying the foundations of the 
country. This lack of responsibil
ity extends to people shifting the 
blame off of themselves onto oth
ers, preferably others who are 
not real. Take the case of two 
teenagers in Pennsylvania who 
were killed this fall after laying 
down in the middle of a road and 
being run over by a car. They did 
this after watching the movie The 
Program. Of course, people were 
outraged after the incident # oc
curred  not at the stupidity of 
the children involved, or at their 
parents, but at the movie. They 
believed that it was because of a 
motion picture that these people 
were dead. Here, people wish to 
shift responsibility away from the 
people involved, and shift it to 
something that cannot attack 
them back.
This same syndrome was again 
apparent this winter when a fiveyear-old child burned down a 
trailer, killing his little sister. 
Who was blamed for this inci
dent? The parents, for allowing 
the child to play with matches?
No. In this case, the fault was 
placed on Beavis and Butthead, 
the infamous MTV cartoon char
acters. Again, the failure of the 
boys education or his parents 
failure to teach and watch over 
him were not questioned. Instead, 
a comedic cartoon show featuringtwo self-proclaimed idiots was 
blamed and again. People refused 
to accept the fact that actual 
people could have been respon
sible for this tragedy.
Why is this a disturbing trend 
that affects our nation as a whole? 
Simply because such an attitude 
leads people to adopt behaviors 
that are not conducive to helping 
our society. Maybe the greatest 
example of this is the taboo topic 
of abortion. Instead of taking the 
responsible action of abstaining 
from sex  the one guaranteed 
method of preventing unwanted 
pregnancies  people continue 
to have sex with the knowledge 
that if pregnancy results, they 
can always have an abortion. This 
act has resulted in the unmerci
ful killing of many unborn chil
dren who never had the opportu
nity to grow up because their 
parents refused to take responsi
bility for their actions.
Now the stakes have been 
raised over this issue. It has be
come apparent that abortion is 
one procedure that the President 
would like to include in his na
tional health care plan. What 
previously was an act to not take 
responsibility for ones actions 
could possibly soon become an 
act that is fully subsidized by you 
and me.
Finally, the importance of ac
cepting responsibility for ones 
own actions should be important 
to American society in general 
because it has caused people to 
believe that the government is 
responsible for their well-being. 
This attitude has become dan
gerous, not only because it has 
cost the American people well 
over one trillion dollars, but also 
because it has created a class of 
people who believe that they do 
not need to provide for themselves 
 if they cannot work, thats all 
right because the government is 
responsible for their well-being 
anyway. Now, we have people on 
welfare, refusing to work and be 
productive in our society because 
they can receive everything they 
needfrom the governmentfood, 
money, and soon, health care. Its
not wrong for the government to 
provide temporary support to 
people in need, but by subsidiz
ing people who refuse to accept 
the responsibility for their own 
life and go out and work, the 
American government has built 
a system that has propagated the 
mindset of the irresponsible.
People no longer wish to lay 
blame on themselves; in fact, 
people seldom want to blame any
thing real. In these feel-good 
times, it seems wrong to say that 
someone did something wrong. 
No, something happened because 
of song lyrics, a television show, 
or the ever-popular temporary 
insanity. The refusal to accept 
responsibility for ones own ac
tions has become a trend that is 
costing the lives of many inno
cent Americans, along with costingthe American taxpayer a great 
deal of money. Its time that 
people begin to understand that 
what they do is by their own 
choice, and that they must live up 
to the consequences of their ac
tions, even if they are not pleas
ant.

We must preserve memory of Holocaust terror
Eric J. Salzman
Someone recently said to me that we 
ought to put the Holocaust behind us and 
get on with our lives. After all, he said, we 
are two generations away and the Holo
caust does not have the impact it once did.
This column is for anyone to read, but I 
am directing it towards the pathetic cow
ard who doesnt think we really need to 
dwell in the past. So listen up good, 
because you are the reason the Holocaust 
happened  apathy. You are the kind of 
Jew who would have been a guard who
policed the other Jews in the ghetto.
Dont you realize that there are still people 
in this world who do not believe that the 
Holocaust ever happened? Because of people 
like you, it could happen again.
The reason activists continue to shove the 
Holocaust in the face of any person they can 
reach is because people think it can never 
happen again. The activists are the people 
who know that before Kristallnacht, no one 
thought that the Holocaust could happen a 
first time.
If thats the way you feel, then go tell my 
aunt and uncle, who lived through the con
centration camps, to get on with their lives. 
Go tell my grandmother, who lost some of 
her closest relatives in a society that just 
wanted to go on with their lives, that she
should not dwell in the past and that she 
should put it behind her. In fact, why 
dont you go tell your own relatives who 
lost their brothers, sisters, mothers, and 
fathers to just forget about it already. 
See how welcome you are at the next 
holiday dinner.
As a person who once forgot and prac
tically renounced his identity and heri
tage, I feel strongly when I remind you of 
the following: People will kill you be
cause you are Jewish. Dont you ever 
forget that. They will think they are 
doing society a favor. No matter how 
nice a guy you are, you were born Jewish 
and they will kill you.
You told me that as an individual, you 
do not have the capability to stop some
thing like the Holocaust. You are not a 
militant person and it is up to the lead
ers to stop such atrocities. Your respon
sibility is to spread your own opinion 
through your vote and what you say. If 
you hear an anti-Semitic remark, you 
would not let it continue.
Let me just say that the next time our 
people face extinction, I sure as hell 
hope I dont have to count on you for 
help. It is your kind of apathy that al
lowed six million Jews to perish. It is 
your kind of apathy that the world felt 
when it let Hitler have his way because 
its not my responsibility to stop it.
You better believe that it is.

Tartans win dramatic game
By CHANDRA BUIST
Tartan Junior Staff writer
The last home game of the sea
son proved to be a rewarding one, 
as the Tartans defeated the 
Emory Eagles in double overtime,
79-77. To start, it was senior 
day, and there was an opening 
ceremony in honor of forward 
Jeanine Megahan, forward Mary 
Moore, and guard Diane Jakubiak.
In the first 20 minutes of play, 
the two teams were neck and 
neck, both fighting to get ahead. 
Capitalizing on turnovers in the 
first half, the Tartans went to the 
locker room ahead, 28-25.
The second half play was giveand-take. The Tartans came out 
strong, gaining a 12-point lead 
during the first eight minutes. 
Emory then got hot, going on a
14-point scoring spree. With six 
minutes left in the game, the 
Eagles were ahead, 48-47. In the 
final seconds, with the Tartans 
down by three, freshman guard 
Kimberly Skena sunk a threepointer to send the game into 
overtime. Skena did a fantastic
job, keeping the Tartans in the 
game by hitting three three-point 
field goals.
The overtime proved to be just 
as exciting, with both teams 
matchingbasketfor basket. Down 
by two with 25 seconds left, 
Megahan hit two foul shots to 
even the score. With the last few 
seconds left, Emory turned the 
ball over, sending the game into 
double overtime.
During this final five minutes, 
the Tartans turned on the heat. 
With less than a minute to go and 
the score tied at 77-77, Moore 
came through. Moore stuffed 
Emory junior forward Nytasha 
Thomas, and then saved the ball 
from flying out of bounds. The 
ball landed in the hands of 
Megahan, who drove down the 
court. She went up strong from 
the lane, sinking the basket and 
drawing the foul.
Megahan had a game-high 29 
points, which is only two points 
away from her career highof 31 
points. She also pulled down four 
rebounds and had five steals. 
Moore also played well, scoring
10 points and grabbing 10 re

bounds.
Tartans Head Coach Gerri Seidl 
felt the same: This is a great way 
for the seniors to go out. We played 
well together as a team.
I am just really happy, be
cause I ended my career the way
I started it, winning. I hope this 
leaves the freshmen with some
thing great to remember us by, 
said Megahan.
A tremendous player, Megahan 
has left the whole school some
thing to remember her by. She is 
the Tartans second all-time lead
ing scorer.
The team snapped its sevengame slump this past Wednes
day, defeating Frostburg State 
University, 70-47.
From the opening play, the 
Tartans were in control. Megahan 
tipped off the ball to Gretz, who 
quickly pushed the ball up the 
court and dished it inside to 
Moore, who went up strong for 
two. This type of team play char
acterized the Tartans entire 
game.
The Bobcats were tough in the 
first 20 minutes, with the Tar
tans leading by only eight at the 
half. But CMU came out hot in 
the second, outscoring the Bob
cats by 15 points. Megahan lead 
the Tartans with 16 points and 
18 rebounds. Summerville played 
strong as well, scoring 14 points 
and pulling down 12 rebounds. 
Also contributing were Gretz with 
12 points and Kupfer with 10 
points and 10 rebounds.
The Tartans had a tough game 
against Waynesburg College on 
Friday evening, losing 77-57.
The Tartan had a tough offen
sive day, with only two players 
scoring in double digits. Moore 
lead the team with 12 points and
II rebounds, and Summerville 
scored 10.
The Tartans end their season 
on Saturday at Rochester.
Swimmers earn tentative 
places at NCAA title meet
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon swim 
team performed well at this 
weeks University Athletic Associ ation championships at the 
University of Rochester. The 
mens team finished fourth, 
while the womens team fin
ished seventh.
The highlight of the tourna
ment, however, was provided 
by sophomore Rebecca Fruehan, named UAA Womens 
Swimmer ofthe Year after post
ing three first-place finishes 
for 60 points.
Fruehan posted B qualify
ing times for the NCAA meet 
in the: 100-yard, 200-yard, and 
500-yardfreestyle events. She 
also set pool records in the 100- 
yard and 200-yard events.
Another women, senior
Denise Fenwick, set a pool record 
and a B qualifying time while 
winning the 200-yard breast
stroke. Fenwick also got B times 
while finishing secondinthe 100- 
yard breaststroke and fifth in the 
200-yard individual medley.
On the mens side, sophomore 
Matt Moe set a UAA record in the 
400-yard individual medley, mak
ing the B qualifying time. In 
the same event, sophomore Geoff 
Waller also achieved the B time, 
finishing fourth.
Moe and Waller both got an
other "B time with individual
Mark Eggert/lartan Art Co-toto
wins. Moe won the 200-yard 
breaststroke, and Waller won 
the 200-yard butterfly. In that 
event, sophomore George 
Schmidt also achieved a B 
time while finishing fourth.
Achieving a B qualifying 
time means a swimmer will 
receive a tentative place at the 
NCAA championship, but that 
place depends on how many 
swimmers achieve A times 
at league meets across the 
country.
The NCAA meet will be held 
in March at Williams College.
Volleyball struggles at IUP
By CAROLYN SKARADA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The mens volleyball club traveled to Indiana 
University of Pa. on Saturday, February 19 to 
compete in an eight-team tournament. Unfortu
nately for CMU, the day was not as successful as 
they had anticipated.
The three teams in our pool took first second and 
third in the tournament overall, sophomore coach 
Chris Rotelli said regarding pool play. The other 
pool at the tournament included University of 
California of Pa., Shippensburg University, Col
lege of Wooster, and Indiana University of Pa.
We just didnt pull it together. When we didnt 
have a perfect pass we were forced to use our 
outlets, senior John Borger said. Poor passing in 
their first game of the day, against Millersville 
University weakened the offense. However, CMU 
tends to be very defense oriented, and the amount
of digs for the day was phenomenonal. After this 
loss to Millersville University, CMU went on to 
play Grove City and then West Virginia. Facing the

Mens basketball crushes Thiel, Emory, reaches 10 wins
By JOHN WEBER
Tartan Staffwriter
The beginning of spring weather and 
longer days means the end of the basket
ball season. Last Sunday afternoon, the 
Tartans finished their season at home 
by handling the Emory Eagles 70-50. 
The Eagle shot only 27 percent from the 
field and only 26 percent from threepoint range. Meanwhile, the Tartans 
cruised as they shot 47 percent from the 
field and never trailed the Eagles the 
entire game.
The Tartans started the game with an 
U-2 run in the first five and a half 
minutes. Emory cut the Tartan lead to 
two points, but then the Tartans scored 
the next nine points capped off with an 
Eric Ronzio three-pointer. In the last six 
minutes of the first half, there were only 
six total points scored. The Tartans went 
into the locker room with a 2415 lead.
In the second half, after a few Eagle 
baskets, the Tartans went on a 121 
run. Then after a few borderline fouls 
slowed their attack, the Tartans pulled 
away. CMU scored 14 of the final 20 
points scored in the game and went on to 
win 70-50. Sophomore Jon Blanciak 
punctuated the game with a slam dunk 
with only 18 seconds remaining.
Almost as important as the basketball 
game was the honoring of the four de
parting Tartan seniors: Charlie Connors, 
Mike Hosni and co-captains Derek 
Dragisich and Matt Reiprish. After the 
game Hosni talked about his best year.
My best playing year was my sopho
more year, [but] I wouldnt regret any of 
them. Ive enjoyed all four of them. 
Hosni and Dragisich surpassed the 1,000 
career point mark earlier this year with 
Connors trailing behind with over 900 
career points. All four seniors will earn 
their fourth varsity letter this season.
Leading scorers for the game were 
Dragisich (14 points) and Hosni (13 
points). Also, Connors racked up eight 
points and led the team with 11 re
bounds. For the Eagles Todd Brown (17 
points) and Jared Grossinger (13 points) 
led the way.
The Tartans have won three in a row 
and are 10-13 for the season. The Tar
tans are also 7-6 in the UAA. The Tar
tans will finish their season on the road 
at the University of Rochester this Sat
urday, February 26.
Last Wednesday, the Tartans captured 
their ninth victory of the season by beat
ing the Thiel Tomcats 80-63 at Skibo 
Gymnasium. The Tomcats came into 
the game with a dreadful 3-19 record,
but they were still able to grab an early 
lead. The Tomcats built an 112 lead 
which included three-pointers from 
freshmen Tim Miller and Chuck Gomez. 
However, in the next five minutes the 
Tartans outscored the Tomcats 13-5, 
aided by three-pointers from freshman 
Rich Bodnar and Reiprish.
The two teams played even until the 
4:19 mark when sophomore Eric Ronzio 
nailed a three-pointer to give the Tar
tans their first lead, 27-25. The first 
half ended with four more three-point 
field goals. First, Thiels Lenny Addams 
hit a three to tie the game at 31. Then 
Bodnar cashed in for the Tartans. Then 
it was Thiels Steve Rischs turn to hit a 
three-pointer with only 57 seconds left. 
But the Tartans got the last score when 
Reiprish nailed a three-pointer with 
only 39 seconds remaining to give the 
Tartans a 37-34 halftime lead, a lead 
that they would never relinquish.
The first half was probably as even as 
a half could be. Both teams shot above 40 
percent from the floor and both teams 
nailed six three-pointers. Whenever a 
team would get a run started, the other 
team would quickly call time out in an 
attempt to break their momentum.
While the first half saw a lot of threepointers and timeouts, the second half
saw a lot of wild plays mixed in with a 
few more timeouts. Sophomore Kevin 
Byrne extended the Tartans lead by 
scoring the Tartans first five points 
making the score 4236. Thiel then 
quickly took its third timeout to try to 
keep the game close. However, the Tar
tans outscored the Tomcats 7-5 in the 
next four minutes forcing the Tomcats 
to take another time out.
Then the game really opened up inside 
and no one was happier than senior 
center Charlie Connors. Later he said, 
senior forward [Dragisich] and I havent 
really clicked together in the same game 
like we have in the past. And he said 
that winning is a matter of intensity, 
something that the Tartans havent had 
much of this year. Wednesday, though, 
things were different.
Connors brought down the house with 
a slam dunk with 12:30 left. Thiel quickly 
took another timeout. Then Thiel an
swered Connors dunk with one of their 
own. Chuck Gomezs dunk with 11:54 
left in the game drew the Tomcats within 
eight points of the Tartans. Connors 
answered with two baskets of his own to 
extend the Tartan lead to 12. Thiel then 
used its final time out with 10:25 left.
At this point, it seemed like the Tar
tans were really trying for another dunk.
Later, Connors verified that suspicion 
when he said, any time you get one, 
youre going for another one.
After the timeout, the Tartans scored 
and then Gomez dunked the ball again 
for the Tomcats. But Connors was not 
done yet. After a beautiful move in the 
lane he added two more points for the 
Tartans. Then a few seconds later, 
Connors rejected a Thiel basket with a 
monster block.
When Connors was done, the Tartans 
had built a 14-point lead on the Tomcats 
with only seven minutes remaining. The 
Tartans played even with Thiel the rest 
of the way and went on to win the game
80-63. Bodnar led the Tartans with 14 
points, followed by Dragisich (13) and 
Connors (12). Tim Miller led the Tom
cats with 22 points, followed by Gomez 
who had 17.
This game was one crazy contest. There 
were three dunks, 14 three-pointers, nine 
time-outs, and then there were Millers 
nine free throws. Miller got a chance to 
shoot three free throws three different 
times last Wednesday and he made all 
nine of them. Getting fouled when shoot
ing a three-pointer is rare, but last 
Wednesday night it happened three 
times. This just goes to show that any
thing can happen at Skibo Gymnasium.

As the snow quickly melts, the 
University Rowing Club is gear*ng up for their spring season. 
Although they are anxious to get 
back on the water, the team has 
maintained condition on ergom
eter rowing machines. Over the 
weekend, the University Rowing 
Club participated in the Pitts
burgh Erg Race, winning the All 
Points Trophy and the Collegiate 
Trophy.
Carnegie Mellon finished in 
first place overall with 136 total 
Points for the day. In second place, 
Three Rivers Rowing Center 
ended up with 134. North Catho
lic came in third place with 69
points. Other teams present at 
the race were Duquesne Univer
sity and Western Reserve. All 
races were 2500 meters long ex
cept for the 1250-meter coxswain 
races.
First place is really impres
sive considering they [the oppo
nents] are schools that give schol
arships, junior Soren Roth said.
Individual highlights for the 
women include two second-place 
finishes to Three Rivers and a 
third place to Duquesne. In heavy
weight competition, sophomore 
Cassa Hadley led the race from 
the start. To much surprise, CMU 
alum Dori Martin, rowing for 
Three Rivers, pulled ahead to win 
the race three seconds ahead of 
Hadley. Martins time for this
remarkably close race was 
10.04.0.
I like the intensity ofthe sport. 
The transition from novice is quite 
a big jump, Cassa said. This is 
her second year on the team.
Senior Vicki Roberts placed 
second in the lightweight compe
tition. Followed by teammate jun
ior Karen Knepper, their times 
were 10.57.4 and 11.05.7, respec
tively. Liz Jones of Three Rivers 
won the race in 9.44.6, a time 
that enables her to compete at 
the World Indoor Rowing Cham
pionships held in Boston next 
weekend.
Novice women had a good show
ing, taking third, fourth, fifth, 
and sixth places. Unfortunately,

College coaches provide entertainment
In Your Face
by Seth A. Covitz
This nation has always loved a 
good fight. First, there were the 
Bobbitts. Then, came Tonya 
Harding vs. Nancy Kerrigan. Now 
in the heat of the Atlantic-10s 
regular season, ESPN brings you 
Chaney vs. Calipari. We set the 
scene at the William D. Mullins 
Memorial Center (capacity 9,493) 
in Amherst, Massachusetts. The 
matchup being brought to you is 
number one versus two in the 
Atlantic-10, the University of 
Massachusetts (UMass) Minutemen versus the Temple Univer
sity Owls.
This premiere matchup is 
heightened due to several facts:
1) UMass has never lost at their
new arena, the Mullins Center, 
2) Temples seniors have never 
won at UMass, 3) This is a must 
win game for the Owls, if they 
want a chance of catching UMass 
for the top spot in the conference, 
and 4) We bring to this game, the 
NCAAs most animated and most 
emotional coaches, John Calipari 
(UMass) and John Chaney 
(Temple).
Round 1: The game is close 
throughout, with both Temple 
and UMass swapping leads but 
with UMass pulling ahead by one 
in the final seconds. The referees 
allow 29 seconds on the clock af
ter the ball goes out of bounds, 
possession to the Owls. Temples 
Aaron McKie catches the ball in 
bounds and takes a barely-con
tested shot. The ball rims in and 
out, and its victory for the Minutemen. The coaches shake hands 
at half court and disappear to 
their respective locker rooms.
Round 2: Chaney wraps up his 
press conference, and Calipari 
enters. Calipari takes the micro
phone and begins to answer a
question about the officiating. 
Chaney reenters and defends the 
refs, saying, They did a helluva 
job. He yells at Calipari about 
riding the refs throughout the 
game, and then the sparks fly. 
Chaney freaks out and rushes 
Calipari. He has to be held back 
by UMass players, reporters, and 
others present. Chaney says, Im 
gonna kick your ass... Thats why 
Im telling my boy to kick your 
fucking boy in the mouth ... Ill 
kill you... you remember that....
Intermission: Chaney is sus
pended for one game in which 
Temple beats St. Bonaventure. 
The President of UMass an
nounces to the public that UMass 
may forfeit the rematch at 
Temple. Chaney apologizes to 
Calipari, UMass and Temple 
players, students, and fans.
Round 3: The rematch this 
Thursday night is at The Cage 
otherwise known as McGonigle 
Hall (capacity 3,900), Temple 
University, Philadelphia.
Hey, whats the big deal? This 
is not the first time these two
coaches have gotten into it. This 
is not the first time that Chaney 
has instructed his players to 
physically attack opponents. This 
is definitely not the first time 
Chaney has said a four-letter 
word in public. This is just the 
most recent. Chaney is an emo
tional kind of guy, and Calipari is 
the kind of guy that will push 
things too far.
According to Associated Press 
reports, Calipari told a referee 
after the game that he would 
never ref in the Mullins Center 
again. Calipari denied saying 
anything, but how much credit 
can you give a guy who, after 
having his life threatened, says 
only, Some things never cease to 
amaze me.
I would have lacked his ass too
 the guy doesnt know when 
enough is enough.
As for Chaney instructing his 
players to physically assault op
ponents during an important 
game, note Temples loss to title 
game-bound Michigan in last 
years Elite Eight tournament 
matchup. Ex-Michigan player
Chris Webber clearly recalled 
Chaney telling a player to knock 
him down. What should you 
make of it? Chaney wants to win,  
and badly, but taking shots at 
opposing players isnt the right 
way.
No one jumps on Bobby Knights 
back when he curses or kicks 
chairs; they cheer him on and 
place him in movies (e.g. Blue 
Chips).
I dont fault Chaney for being 
himself and standing up for what 
he thought was an injustice. I do 
fault him for complying with the 
weak, politically correct society 
that he apologized to.
In a heated moment anything 
can happen, but it was over after 
Chaney left the press conference. 
Chaney even assured ESPN that 
nothing would happen in the 
rematch.
I think they should let it go and 
let the game of basketball decide 
who was right. Again, the rematch 
is this Thursday on ESPN.
Seth A. Covitz is a sophomore 
computer science major.

three teams advance, they 
battled it out in the playoffs. 
The hitting started to come, 
but we had a lot of errors. 
Things started to fall apart, 
Borger said. Things could 
have gone either way during 
that game of unforced errors, 
but West Virginia came out 
on top.
CMU will begin another 
busy week today when they 
travel to Slippery Rock for a 
dual meet.
Lillehammer Olympics show off finest international talent
The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bourdius
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman 
spent a large part of the last week at the 
XVII Winter Olympic Games in 
Lillehammer, Norway, discussing the 
possibility of NHL players taking part in
the 1998 Winter Games to be held in 
Nagano, Japan. International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) president Juan-Antonio Samaranch and International Ice 
Hockey Federation (IIHF) president 
Gunter Sabetzki met with Bettman twice 
to discuss the issue.
The biggest stumbling block isnt the 
NHL, IOC, or IIHF, but the NHL own
ers. Team owners are reluctant, because 
the season would have to be suspended 
for two or three weeks for the Olympics. 
They feel that their teams would lose too 
much revenue from ticket and conces
sions sales. Thats pretty much a moot
argument since the revenue issues could 
be compensated for by starting the sea
son earlier and letting it run a few weeks 
later.
Team USA got off to a shaky start in 
Lillehammer. They came from behind in 
all of their first three games to tie. 
Saturdays game against Sweden was 
very important. USA trailed 4-1 enter
ing the third period but closed to 5-4 in 
the first 10:51 of the period. Third period 
comebacks have been the hallmark of 
this years Olympic squad, but this time 
it wasnt to be. Former NHL star Hakan 
Loob iced the Swedish victory with a
goal at 18:51.
The real Cinderella story of this Olym
pics hockey tournament belongs to 
Slovakia. Slovakia, less than a year old 
as an independent nation, is 2-0-2 and 
has guaranteed itself a spot in the medal 
round. The Slovaks, led by Peter Stastny, 
could very well face their former coun
trymen, the Czech Republic in the quar
ter finals. Slovakia produced a major 
upset Saturday night, defeating Canada 
3-1.
The current favorite for the gold medal 
has to be Finland. The Finns have been 
disposing of their opponents right and
left, most notably traditional hockey 
powerhouse Russia whom they beat, 5-
0. The bad news is that if Team USA 
does make the medal round, they have 
to play Finland in the quarter finals. 
The good news is that history could be on 
the Americans side. USA beat Finland 
in the 1980 gold medal game after the 
dramatic Miracle on Ice 4-3 victory 
over the Soviet Union at Lake Placid, 
New York.

The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
In the words of Steve Miller, Time keeps on 
ticking, ticking ... towards opening day.... Did he 
actually say that? Well, even if he didnt, baseball 
fans, Im sure that is what he meant, because 
everybody starts to feel the excitement as we inch 
closer to opening day. Only six weeks now!
So with that said and done, lets continue with 
my forecasts and predictions for the 1994 season, 
with this weeks feature beingthe American League 
Central Division.
Chicago White Sox: After several years of pos
ing as also-rans, the White Sox stepped forward 
in 1993 by winning the American League West and
pushing the Toronto Blue Jays to six games before 
bowing out, in the American League Champion
ship Series. And, though the White Sox suffered a 
disappointing defeat, they are back with a ven
geance this year in their new division, with World 
Series hopes pinned on their heads.
The Sox have all the key parts from last year still 
in place. Bolsteredbylastyears MVP, first baseman 
Frank Thomas, the Sox feature such names as 
third baseman Robin Ventura, outfielder Tim 
Raines, catcher Ron Karkovice, the newly acquired 
designated hitter Julio Franco, and outfielder 
Darrin Jackson.
As for the pitching staff, the White Sox, despite 
recent contract negotiation troubles and trade ru
mors, will return Cy Young winner Jack McDowell 
to head a staff which could potentially rival the 
Atlanta Braves this year as the best in baseball. 
Wilson Alvarez, Alex Fernandez, and Jason Bere, 
the two, three, and four starters, all have the stuff 
to win 20 games in the majors. The number five 
spot will probably be claimed by either James 
Baldwin or Scott Ruffcorn, two highly regarded 
prospects. If the Sox dont get to the World Series,
it wont be because of them.
As for the bull pen, the Sox feature a youngster 
who is only going to get better. Closer Roberto 
Hernandez rose to prominence last,:year with 38 
saves and a 2.29 earned run average. The rest of 
the pen, though not spectacular, is solid.
General Manager Ron Scheuler and Manager 
Gene Lamont have put the pieces all in place. The 
problem is not whether they can win the division, 
but how good the competition will be.
Cleveland Indians: The Indians are sort of a
cosmic phenomenon. The last time this team was 
in the postseason was 1954  the year that the 
Indians set the record for most regular season 
wins, a record that remains to be broken. But 40 
years later, it seems that the planets have all 
realigned themselves in favor of the Indians, as a 
new movie {Major League II), a new ballpark (Gate
way Park), new uniforms, and a renewed fan base, 
all have fallen in place to complement a team that 
could very well dominate in the American League

Indians, White Sox battle in Central
CENTRAL, from page 10this year.
players such as outfielder Albert Belle, second 
baseman Carlos Baerga, outfielder Kenny Lofton, 
and newly acquired designated hitter Eddie Murray 
form what looks like (going into spring training) 
the best lineup in baseball. Prospects Jim Thome 
and Manny Ramirez will make a major impact 
when they finally reach their potential.
The glaring weak spot going into the year was 
the starting rotation, as they had a slew of pros
pects, but none quite ready for the majors yet. But 
with the recent signings of Dennis Martinez and 
Jack Morris to complement a healthy Charles 
Nagy and Jose Mesa, the Indians feature four 
starters who can win 15 games or more in 1994.
Meanwhile, despite the tragic deaths of two key 
pitchers last year, the bullpen was a strong point 
for the Indians in 1993 and will continue to be in 
94. Bolstered by veteran Derek Lilliquist and last 
years surprising rookie Jerry DiPoto, the Indians 
can safely leave a lead in the hands of their pen. 
They also signed ex-Yankee closer Steve Farr.
John Hart is a genius in terms of general manag
ers. Not only has he locked up all his young stars 
over the next several years, but he has also hired a 
manager (Mike Hargrove) who is well-liked by 
players and managers alike. But the key to whether 
the Indians are a true contender or just an also 
ran will be if oft-injured catcher Sandy Alomar 
can stay healthy.
Kansas City Royals: This team was once a 
prime example of stability under owner Ewing 
Kaufmann. Not only were the Royals a favorite for 
the players, but the team was a winner, year in and 
year out.
But times have changed. Kaufmann is dead and 
the most popular sports hero in KC.s history, 
George Brett, is retired. So the Royals continue to 
proceed, hoping they can put together a winner 
despite the fact that they lack any high quality 
prospects who are ready and that they no longer 
have the mega dollars to sign free agents who could 
make a difference.
For now the Royals will try to win with names 
such as first baseman Wally Joyner, outfielders 
Brian McRae and Felix Jose, and the newly ac
quired outfielder Vince Coleman, who should re
vive his career in K.C. The Royals will try and fill 
their power needs for now with prospects Phil 
Hiatt and Bob Hamelin.
The Royals have a solid staff  mostly due to the
fact that their first two starters, Kevin Appier and 
David Cone, are two of the best in the game. After 
that, the best they can do is Hipolito Pichardo, but 
once again, the rest of the A.L. should be warned 
that once the Royals young prospects reach the 
majors, the Royals could have a deadly starting 
rotation.
The bullpen is extremely solid, with closer Jeff 
Montgomery (45 saves, 2.29 ERA) and setup men 
Stan Belinda and Rusty Meacham. There is not 
much need for change there.
It remains to be seen whether manager Hal 
McRae can be successful in the majors. Under his 
direction, the team has been either extremely hot
or extremely cold in its performance.
Milwaukee Brewers: This is a team that not 
only has no money and no direction, but their 
owner is too busy acting as commissioner to pay 
any attention to the team. It is also the start of a 
new era for the Brew Crew as the big three (Paul 
Molitor, Jim Gantner, and Robin Yount) have 
finally disintegrated withYounts retirement.
Spearheaded by sluggers Greg Vaughn, Daryl 
Hamilton, B.J. Surhoff, and newly acquired Jody 
Reed, the Brewers have a crew of youngsters that 
have already made an impact or will do so soon, i.e. 
Pat Listach, John Jaha, and Dave Nilsson. With 
Younts retirement, outfielder Matt Mieske also 
has a chance to make an impact.
Listach will have to return to his 1992 form if the
Brewers are to avoid the cellar, and Jaha, who 
really came on at the end of 93, will have to 
continue to improve. The growth of Nilsson may 
have been stymied by the recent acquisition of 
catcher Brian Harper.
The pitching staff follows in the line of the of
fense  it has potential, but is not mature. But 
with the possible return of former ace Ted Higuera, 
the Brewers could feature five starters who have 
won 11 or more games at least once (Higuera, Cal 
Eldred, Ricky Bones, Bill Wegman, Jamie Navarro). 
The bullpen, meanwhile, despite lacking a true 
closer, is fairly solid in terms of middle innings and 
a closer may emerge from this group  Graeme 
Lloyd for example.
It is time for Bud Selig to return to his team. It is 
a team which has the potential to go somewhere, 
since the right management is in place with GM 
Sal Bando and manager Phil Garner.
Minnesota Twins: The Twins are in a rebuild
ing stage, there is no question about that. The 
question is: How long will the process take?
Centered around superstar outfielder Kirby 
Puckett, the up and coming star Chuck Knoblauch, 
and aging veterans D ave Winfield and Kent Hrbek, 
the Twins next year will feature such youngsters 
as Matt Walbeck and Dave McCarty. For now, this 
lineup will definitely struggle, especially with the 
imminent trade of productive Shane Mack. But 
given a year or two, with Puckett still in his prime, 
the Twins could feature one of the best lineups in 
the majors.
The same story applies for the pitching staff. 
Coming off of awful years, veterans Scott Erickson 
and Kevin Tapani should rebound, but can young
sters such as Eddie Guardado and Pat Mahomes 
finally come into their own? If they can, the Twins 
could win 75-80 games this year.
The bullpen is fairly solid with closer Rick 
Aguilera. Larry Casian and Mark Guthrie and 
youngster Brett Merriman provide depth.
General Manager Andy McPhail and manager 
Tom Kelly are two of the best at their respective 
positions. But financial constraints have limited 
their moves.
Projected Order of Finish: 1) Cleveland Indians,
2) Chicago White Sox, 3) Milwaukee Brewers, 4) 
Kansas City Royals, 5) Minnesota Twins.

Intolerance
confronted
By KEEGAN FOLK
Tartan Contributing Editor
Roslyn Hall works for the Hous
ing Office as the Area Coordina
tor for Operations, gets paid at 
the end of the month, pays the 
bills, cleans her apartment, 
washes her clothes, etc. Sound 
pretty normal? Well, it is. People 
ask me, Whats your lifestyle 
like? My lifestyles not any dif
ferent from someone whos a het
erosexual  other than [the fact 
that] I cant legally marry the 
person Id want to marry, said 
Hall.
I talked with Hall last week 
about what she thought were 
some of the issues facing gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual staff, fac
ulty, and students on campus. 
Some of the topics we discussed 
were the rights to benefits for 
domestic partners of faculty and 
ROTC, harassment, and 
tolerance versus acceptance. You 
probably wont be surprised to 
ind out that, as far as the situa
tion for gays, lesbians, and bi
sexuals on campus goes, CMU is 
Better than some schools and 
worse than others.
Hall talked about how she 
gauged the level of acceptance or 
tolerance, or intolerance, of the 
campus community for lesbians, 
jays and bisexuals.
A lot of harassment isnt 
reported to anyone. I think yes, 
[homosexuality] is tolerated  
acceptance is a whole different 
thing. Im a firm believer that 
acceptance has to come from in
dividuals. The institute or a pro
gram cant mandate that you ac
cept something.
And thats basically what it all 
comes down to  beliefs. You 
may believe that same-sex rela
tionships are wrong, or maybe 
you believe the opposite.
Peoples beliefs are not easy to 
When someone firmly 
believes in something, it is virtu
ally impossible to convince them 
otherwise.
The problem is not that people 
have different belief systems, its 
that we often do not try to under
stand why someone else may 
think differently.
When I do presentations, said 
Hall, my statement is, I accept 
that you may not accept me. Im 
not out to change peoples values 
what they think of as right 
wrong, but I am out to make 
them think about where they 
learned those values, to question 
how they got those values.
Its amazing that on college 
campuses  especially CMU 
which is supposed to be the best 
and the brightest  that people 
have never once stepped outside 
f themselves and looked at Why 
d I think its wrong to be fat, why 
I think its wrong to be a leswhy do I think Im better 
;ause whatever. They dont 
and think, said Hall.
A lot of the harassment of bi8e*uals, gays, and lesbians on 
Campus occurs simply because 
People do not bother to stop and 
think.
As Hall said, much harassment 
foes not get reported, and a lot of 
| is what Hall refers to as hiden harassment: having to watch 
what you say and endure 
lmophobic comments and genral insensitivity as a lesbian, 
> or bisexual.
Sometimes the homophobia
hecai
even comes from gays, lesbians, 
and bisexuals who fear being 
found out, especially gay men in 
fraternitiesone of the last great 
bastions of heterosexual male 
unity.
In an environment where you 
cant be sure of the level of toler
ance you will encounter, it is of
ten easier to keep your mouth 
shut, which is in itself a form of 
discrimination.
It is often the case that lesbi
ans, bisexuals, and gays on this 
campus and elsewhere feel they 
have to deny that part of them
selves which some people think 
of as perverted or wrong. The 
military has adopted the dont 
ask, dont tell policy for homo
sexuals in the armed forces. Mar
ried people in the military dont 
have to pretend that they arent 
married, but a gay man or woman 
has to pretend that s/he doesnt 
have a partner, even if they have 
been together for years.
The military is still discrimi
nating against gays, lesbians, and 
bisexuals, and CMITs own branch 
of the military, ROTC, also disLovers 
need rights
Daniel Frey/Tartan Darkroom Manager

hr
criminates against homosexuals. 
ROTC is in violation of the mis
sion statement of this school, 
said Hall. ROTC is clearly dis
criminating, but institutional dis
crimination is not the only source 
of trouble for lesbian, gay, and 
bisexual people on campus. Hall 
says she has heard reports of stu
dents being beaten up because of 
their sexual orientation.
She also told me the story of a 
student who was moving from 
one dorm room to another and 
returned to his original room to 
get the rest of his belongings only 
to find a sign declaring that the 
floor was now faggot free.
Hall, along with Katie Stannard 
and Harriet Schwartz, both as
sistants to the dean of Student 
Affairs, got ALLIES started.
Our mission is to give support 
to gay, lesbian, and bisexual stu
dents and staff members, but 
there is certainly no requirement
 we dont care if youre hetero
sexual, homosexual, bisexual or 
no-sexual, its not important, 
said Hall.
What is important, according 
to Hall, is having a visible net
work of support for gay, bisexual, 
and lesbian people on campus. 
ALLIES members identify them
selves with the rainbow-colored 
triangles youve seen around cam
pus.
I know what its like to be on a 
college campus and not be out 
and to not know who you could 
talk to. Thats the one thing weve 
tried to do is create enough of a 
presence on campus that people 
would go, Wow, I know what that 
symbol means.  The Womens 
Center and cmuOUT also offer 
support for lesbians, gays, and 
bisexuals.
For me, [CMU] has been the 
best place that I could work. Im 
very out, although I feel sure 
there are lots of people on cam
pus who dont know because Ive 
never stood up and made an 
announcement.... I think there 
are students on campus who 
know that Im here if they need 
support. 
said Hall.
Ive just 
been really 
fortunate. 
People have 
been really 
accepting; 
its no big 
deal. Ive 
[brought] 
my partner 
to functions, 
social gath
erings for 
people in 
the Housing Office, and theyve 
been really accepting of her. For 
me, its been a very, very posi
tive situation.
But, she says, it also depends 
on where you are at CMU be
cause some departments or of
fices can be more understanding 
than others.
For instance, CMU has a sum
mer picnic for employees at 
Kennywood. Kennywood, how
ever, has made it clear that they 
do not welcome lesbians, gays, 
and bisexuals. For the last two 
years, there has been no attempt 
to find an alternative location 
where everyone could feel com
fortable.
Feeling comfortable in a situ
ation, for anyone, can make the 
difference between a good and 
bad experience. Coming out in a 
good situation is definitely far 
preferable to the alternative.
Hall found coming out to be 
very worthwhile, but at the same 
time cautions against being too 
hasty in making the decision, 
especially for young people.
No one can make the decision 
to come out or stay closeted for 
you, and it is not a decision to be 
lightly made because, unfortu
nately, there is a lot of hate to
wards gays, bisexuals and lesbi
ans.
I feel that the hate that comes 
from people is based on fear, 
myths, and misinformation they 
have received, and hate is an 
easy emotion to learn. Regard
less, Hall will continue to work 
for the further understanding of 
lesbian, gay, and bisexual 
people. Im in for the long term, 
she said. Ill always be educat
ing about gay and lesbian issues 
no matter where I am.

In some senses, being gay is different than other minority 
groups. African-Americans, people with disabilities  they are all 
fighting for equal access, they are trying to get into something. But 
gays and lesbians have always been there; its not an issue of 
representation.
These are the words of Scott Safier, senior research programmer 
at the Robotics Institute, and proponent of Domestic Partnerships 
at CMU. During an interview Friday, Safier voiced some of the 
many problems that gays and lesbians face in the workplace, and 
the steps that employers must take to help alleviate them. There 
are four steps that places of employment must go through in order 
to become more sensitive to gay issues: denounce sexual discrimi
nation based on sexual orientation in a formal statement (CMU did 
that in the 80s), act on this statement, create Domestic Partner
ships, and actually begin to do things to help that minority group. 
Safier said that in order for an institution or company to act on 
their statement of denounced discrimination of gays and lesbians 
they must look at the policies that exist in the institution and 
remove the ones that are heterosexual [assume that everyone is 
heterosexual], or homophobic (for example, do not challenge the action of calling someone a faggot). 
The institution can also educate people, through such groups as ALLIES here on campus. CMU has 
been [worse] at trying to educate people in the workforce [than they were at creating a formal 
statement against homosexual discrimination].
Safier went on to explain the dominant role that Domestic Partnership plays in both the business 
and personal lives of an institutions employees. One of the factors that affects employees most is 
benefits. CMU began offering benefits to married couples a longtime ago, in order to stay competitive 
with other employers. This is discriminatory against gays and lesbians, because the state of 
Pennsylvania does not sanction marriage for them. However, many homosexuals are involved in 
dedicated, long-term relationships.
Safier added that universities such as Stanford, MIT, and Columbia all have domestic partner
ships for both same and other sex couples, although only about four percent of employees at these 
schools utilize this option. Safier asserts that all surveys show that this is not a costly expenditure. 
Prospective employees will ask, do they have Domestic Partnership? Will they take care of my 
family? And CMU will lose on that right now.
In Pittsburgh, WQED is the first employer in [Pennsylvania] to offer domestic partnership. This 
is because the insurance companies do not want to write the policies (this is why CMU has not given 
in to domestic partnership). But the Pittsburgh High Technology Council is trying to institute 
Domestic Partnerships as we speak.
Safier stated that, as of November, 18 employees had registered for domestic partnerships at 
CMU; nine are homosexual couples, and nine are heterosexual couples. The Faculty Senate and the 
Staff Council are asking the University to offer 
these benefits. At this point, theyre meeting 
with insurance companies and asking them 
will you write insurance plans for same and 
opposite sex couples?  Safier said that the 
specific benefits which they hope to obtain are 
health care, tuition benefits, and family and 
leave benefits.
He also explained the recent campus contro
versy surrounding a student, Pat Mooney, who 
is suing the University. Mooney claims that he 
is the victim of religious discrimination since 
his religion does not sanction homosexuality, 
and domestic partnership, if instituted, will 
force him to. You have to make the distinction 
between belief and behavior. There are a lot of
Daniel Frey/Tartan Darkroom Manager
people whose religion condones homosexuality. You cannot always act on these beliefs, however, 
especially in the workplace.
Gay issues discussed
By MATT ADLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Unfortunately, trying to develop a sense of 
identity at CMU can be a difficult experience for 
someone with other than a heterosexual sexual 
orientation. Though students often feel limited 
by the social scene, the gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
students feel an additional pressure. The kind 
of shit society dumps on us, said Chris Newman, 
a staff member with computing services who 
also completed his undergraduate degree here, 
makes the dating scene harder than for straight 
people.
Another aspect of the college experience for 
gays or lesbians include feeling outcast or hated 
for their sexual orientation. Everyone I spoke to 
has experienced some form of harassment or 
intolerance, from vandalism, to defacement of 
cmuOUT posters, to direct verbal harassment. 
What may be most prevalent, however, is the 
discomfort which comes from overhearing people 
make the nasty kinds of comments weve all 
heard or made.
Some of the other concerns I ran into range 
from the invisibility issue, to low awareness of 
options and procedures when harassment takes 
place. One graduate student, who wished to
remain anonymous, said, The lack of activism 
makes this place seem worse than it is... because 
you dont feel like you have a real way to deal with 
issues, or know what you can do if there are 
problems.
Being a grad student and an activist is a bad 
thing, she said, somewhat in regard to her advi
sor and her expected level of commitment to 
research. Im constantly making choices and 
deciding what to say and let on about. The 
biggest difficulty for gays, lesbians, and bisexu
als on this campus may be the decision to stay 
closeted or come out; anyone who has come out 
will tell you it probably wasnt the easiest thing 
they had ever done. For Sherri Johnson, a senior 
art major, coming out to herself was the hardest 
part. First I had to get comfortable with myself. 
I tentatively came out to one person, and that was 
positive. Then I expanded on that slowly with my 
friends. Finally I got confident enough to tell my 
parents. Many people who come to college and 
find people more receptive to the idea of same-sex 
relationships can utilize the support of ALLIES 
or cmuOUT. In fact, many people use ALLIES as 
a bridge  staying in the closet and supporting 
others who have come out, until they are confi
dent enough to come out as well. But then telling

Lecturer discusses 
human motivationCoffee relieves stress ... yeah, right
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
On Tuesday night, the Skibo 
Ballroom was bustling with ac
tivity; about 225 members of the 
community, and reporters from 
all over Pittsburgh, were arriv
ing to sit down and listen to one 
man, Dr. Walter Williams, talk 
about the role of government in a 
free society.
Williams is a professor of eco
nomics at George Mason Univer
sity. He has made numerous tele
vision appearances, including 
Larry King Live, Nightline, and 
20/20. Also the author of several
Just because something 
is legal does not make it
If he were to give the woman 
$200 for food and shelter, of his 
own will, then that would be char
ity. But, if the government were 
to intervene, take $200 from Wil
liams in the form of taxes and 
then spend that $200 on the 
woman, then it would be robbery.
Williams pointed out that there 
are two kinds of theft: illegal theft 
and legal theft. The government 
fits into the latter. But, you may 
say, taxes are legal, arent they? 
Just because something is legal 
does not make it right. As Will
iams said, Legality should not 
be our talisman.
Williams also expressed the 
concept that the no
blest of human moti
vations is greed (or, 
as some people like to 
call it, enlightened 
self-interest). He 
wanted to know why

serves as the guest host for the 
Rush Limbaugh radio show. The 
event was sponsored by the Po
litical Speakers Forum Board, the 
CMU College Republicans (CR), 
and the Young Americas Foun
dation.
After an introduction by CRs 
Julie Malone, Williams informed 
the audience that after the lec
ture there would be questions, 
and he was uninsultable, un
less you tell him he cant play 
basketball, in which he has a 
sense of ethnic pride. This joke 
lightened up the audience and 
set the tone for an hour-long 
speech in whichWilliams touched 
on some very important issues 
affecting us all.
Williams believes that taxes, 
in essence, are government 
claims on private property.
He proposed an example of 
walking down a street in Pitts
burgh and seeing a woman on a 
street grate.
to give something only if you are 
going to get something in return.
In 1982, Williams, along with 
several Constitutional lawyers, 
including Robert Bork, drafted a 
Constitutional amendment which 
would limit the amount of money 
that Congress could spend. While 
it passed the Senate, it did not 
pass the House.
Since then, Congress has been 
overspending on social programs 
and running up a deficit. When 
asked, a person posing a question 
could not name one social pro
gram that worked, to the mirth of 
the audience.
The evening was full of humor 
and serious commentary.
If you missed this lecture, 
though, dont be disappointed. On 
Thursday, February 24, Dr. Ben 
Ngubane, Minister of Health for 
the KwaZulu government, will 
be discussing the current situa
tion in South Africa in the Skibo 
Ballroom.

Feeling stressed lately? Sure 
you are. You have major exams 
and papers due next week. In 
fact, you have something really 
huge and important to hand in 
for every class youre taking. 
These papers are so vastly im
portant that, from here, it looks 
like your entire future depends 
on the grade you get for them.
Written anything yet? Nah, me 
neither. If you ask me 111 tell you 
Im still gathering my sources, or 
that Im making sure Im really 
prepared before launching in. 
That Ive got it under control.
Yeah, right. What I really am is 
suffering from temporary stress 
paralysis. You know the symp
toms  a blatant disregard for 
the passage of time, a sudden 
addiction to computer games, a 
nasty habit of staring at a blank 
page for hours on end, and a sui
cidal consumption of caffeine.
Luckily, this last vice is easy to
accomplish. The recent addition 
of decent coffee houses to the 
Pittsburgh area has enabled 
stressed out students everywhere 
to get a great cup of java when 
they need one. Ive certainly con
sumed my fair share of the jumpy 
juice lately, and it got me to think
ing: Why on earth do we drink the 
stuff? Apart 
from the ben
efits of caf
feine, there 
are plenty of 
reasons to 
develop a cof
fee habit. My 
favorites are 
these: it has 
all the heal
thy benefits 
and look of 
Coke but 
without the 
annoying 
carbonation. No risk of burping 
here. You can purchase it in a 
number of convenient contain

environmentally responsible be
ing the huge plastic mugs that 
you can present for free refills. 
Coffee shops make great hang 
out places where you can enjoy 
the decor and even catch a movie, 
or buy a groovy t-shirt while youre
at it.
You can blame your bad breath 
on coffee and be instantly for
given. Kids dont like it; coffee is 
truly an adult drink in this re
spect. Like all the best foods and 
drinks, it ought to be stored in the 
fridge. You can use any number 
of fancy contraptions to make it.

Drinking cof

vides an ex
cellent excuse 
to consume the highly fattening 
pastries that are sold seductively 
alongside the coffee.
Speaking of seduction, what 
would we do without the classic,

Whether you actually have any

losing your romantic capacity.
You can get a coffee anywhere 
in the world, even in England, a 
nation so preoccupied with the 
consumption of tea that their 
entire history was influenced in 
the pursuit of it. Remember the 
British Empire? It consisted 
mainly of places the English 
thought would be great places to 
get tea. They hit the jackpot with 
India.
Back home, Im regarded as a 
freak of nature because I dont 
drink tea. Cant stand the stuff.
No, coffees my beverage of 
choice. And when my hands stop 
shaking and punching these keys, 
it will have powered me through 
at least one of my immediately 
pressing assignments  writing 
this article. Now, back to that 
blank page....
Micki Kochanskyj is a senior 
creative writing major who knows 
that in order to succeed in her 
chosen field, this staring at a 
blank page thing has to stop. And 
soon. Her favorite coffee is Papua 
New Guinea Dark Roast, a virgin 
bean which has never been 
touched by the insidious effects of 
pesticide, and is so strong it ought 
to be illegal.
Colorful campus astonishes, frightens
Horror Stories
by Tom Harper
While strolling around campus 
lately, there has only been one 
dominant color  white. Snow 
piled up, snow covering sheets of 
ice, and the salt that gets all over 
your shoes.
Now that winter is temporarily 
behind us, there is no excuse not 
to enjoy the medley of colors that 
is CMU and wonder what kind of
chemical the guy who painted 
Donner was on.
While the debate from orienta
tion about the color of Donner 
has faded into memory, I still say 
its green. The kind of green one 
finds in most restrooms.
Schlag, Scobell, and MMCH 
possess another weird color  
its concrete but a little darker.
The same restroom green of 
Dormer is almost exactly the same 
color as Skibos curtains. Yuk! 
When they demolish Skibo, I hope 
they put the curtains out of their 
misery first.
Porter, Baker, Hamerschlag, 
and Doherty share two colors  
the concrete color plus the cop
per green that rims each roof.
That green is just like the Statue 
of Liberty green.
Wean is the exception (in motif 
and color). The halls are stone 
grey. The outside is, uh... hmmm 
... I guess it would be more .... 
Well, the W thingy in front of it is 
bright orange.
The Beeler Street Garage, the 
gym, and GSIA share the con
crete color of Porter and its ilk, 
but it looks like the painters failed 
to capture the copper green color. 
Around the windows the green 
appears to be a dark olive. Whose 
idea was that?
Then theres the dilemma of 
the former Naval Reserve Cen
ter. Its white with grey and brick 
red. Will it be painted? Will they
put up new concrete aluminum 
siding to match Hamburg Hall? 
Will it stick out like a sore thumb?
And so, as you shade your eyes 
from the glare of all the colors 
hitting you at one time, espe
cially the blinding shine of Hunt 
Librarys aluminum, rest assured 
the white of snow will be back 
upon us in a few days. Knowing 
my luck, itll cover a really large 
and smooth ice patch.
Tom Harper, artistically inept 
and dazzled MCS freshman, is 
right now looking for a pair of' 
decent sunglasses and a different 
color paint for the W in front of 
Wean. However, he cant find 
restroom green anywhere yet.Jewish pride, awareness celebrated
By TINAL.URSO
Tartan Contributing Editor
This week will be the first ever Jewish Awareness Week at both 
CMU and Pitt, sponsored by the Hillel Foundation of Pittsburgh, a 
local organization that promotes pride in and awareness of Jewish 
faith and culture. There are many events slated that Hillel hopes 
will help bring members of the campus Jewish community closer 
together. Although the primary focus of this week will be the 
promotion of pride and awareness within the Jewish community, 
there are plenty of events that anyone with an interest in learning 
about or experiencing Jewish culture can participate in.
There will be an Israeli Film Festival at the Beehive all week, and 
there will be many lectures and panel discussions that will be open 
to the public. A showing of the Israeli film Black to the Promised 
Land, will be co-sponsored by Hillel and Shalichah, the Community 
Relations Council of the United Jewish Federation, which will 
precede an open discussion between African-American and JewishAmerican college students.
Ending the weeks events will be a public discussion, Choosing to 
be Jewish, where many Jewish students, and even former mayor
Sophie Masloff, will share their ideas on how being Jewish influ
ences their lives on a regular basis.
This is truly a new day and a wonderful approach to reaching out 
and bringing Hillel right to the students, says Hillel co-chair and 
sophomore Pitt student, Amy Stemthal. She says this week of 
awareness is the result of a new, campus-focused approach that 
Hillel has begun to take.
Executive director of Hillel, Rabbi Art Donski, agrees. After seven 
months on campus, he says, Everyday I realize what tremendous 
potential we have for building a strong foundation for Jewish 
campus life. He hopes the varied programming that campus Hillel 
leaders have organized will represent this New Hillel image of 
reaching out to Jewish college students on their own level. Events 
planned for the week span from lectures/discussions to social events 
to celebration of the Shabbat with local host families.
Donski expressed his overall expectations about how Jewish 
Awareness Week will turn out. We have an opportunity to make the 
phrase Jewish Continuity, which many in our community utter, a 
reality. It is our mission, and G-d willing, we will succeed.
For more information about Jewish Awareness Week, call 621- 
8875, or call Chabad House at 683-7770.

the parents can be very difficult. As Johnson said, My parents 
exemplified the difference between acceptance and tolerance. My 
dad accepts me, and my mom barely tolerates me. On the 
extreme, at least two students were cut off by their parents and 
had to withdraw from school for financial reasons. The gay and 
lesbian awareness groups have made coming out an easier 
experience for many people. As Newman said, bars are not a nice 
way to come out. Theres a lot of attitude, drinking and smoking 
which I find unpleasant. cmuOUT was a very comfortable setting 
for me.
To combat the problem of awareness, Katarina Midelfort, 
senior chemistry major and active member of ALLIES, said, I 
think there should be more forced discussion on this campus so 
that gay and lesbian issues become a topic everyone is conscious 
of. Sarah Pendergrass, a sophomore art major transfer, is a 
lesbian, and agrees. Toomueh negative stuff is said that people 
get away with. More dialogue will help end the stereotypes which 
hurt everyone, she said. Compared to Smith College, where she 
started out, she said, I dont think the freshmen here feel they 
have a lot of room to experiment with relationships because the 
campus is so conservative.... On this campus Im sure a lot of 
people feel alone, and it doesnt have to be that way. People dont 
talk, or know resources are there, and are afraid to reach out to 
the resources. Homosexuality is a quiet issue around here, but 
the fact is that there are gays and lesbians in, or teaching, our 
classes. There are many conservatives on campus, said 
Pendergrass, and sometimes it takes a deep breath before going 
into the gay issue. Only time and continued efforts toward 
awareness and an open mind will make the situation better.

THE MlSAoVENTWftK ofIn a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.

DIVERSIONS
Black Rider 
disturbs
jjy JOHN BIGGS
Diversions Co-Editor
An opera is supposed to be a 
staid affair, with singers leak
ing emotion on stage, wet with 
soprano singing and sounding 
large and tearful. However, Tom 
Waits, with his score to the op
era The Black Rider, decided 
otherwise.
Waits latest release, The 
Black Rider is a jaunt through a 
dark carnival where freak shows 
are the norm and bullets are 
given out as camy prizes. Begin1 with a barkers invitation 
to Harrys Harbour Bizzare, the 
score twists and turns through 
the dark woods that surround 
the Flash Pan Hunter and the 
mysterious Black Rider and his 
Gospel Train. The songs growl 
scream, as Waits work is 
apt to do, and fly through or
chestral pieces insane with 
frenzy. And, one is constantly 
reminded that this is in fact an 
opera and there is a story line, 
though buried under rantings 
and archane nightmares.
I found The Black Rider to be 
stranger and more disturbing 
than Waits usual fare. I sup3 thats good. If you have 
never had the pleasure of listento any of Waits material, 
there is no description for it. 
However, Ill chance to say it is a 
cross between a buzzsaw trying 
to sing and Mariachi band on 
highly effectual hallucinogens. 
For example, inTAint No Sin, 
he sounds like a senile man howl
ing lines like Taint no sin/ to 
strip off your skin/ and dance 
around in your bones. Also, his 
choice of instruments and styles 
is fascinating. In most songs, a 
woodcutters saw is played in the 
background and for Russian 
Dance, one can almost feel the 
orchestra being whipped into a 
frenzy by Waitsmad hollering.
Written in Hamburg, Ger
many with the help of William 
Burroughs, of Naked Lunch 
fame, and Robert Wilson, The 
Black Rider was created for the 
Thalia Theatre and is currently 
being performed in New York. 
However, the score itself is not 
for the faint of heart or the mu
sically sensitive. As is his 
nature, Waits has made music 
around music, missing a few 
notes here and there and mixing 
styles like an artist mixing me
dia. If you have never heard 
Waits before, do not purchase 
this album. Buy his Early Years 
collections first, and then work 
your way up to The Black Rider. 
However, you can still be able to 
appreciate Waits vision, though 
youll be a little confused at first.

Tartan Staffwriter
The Drama Department premiered two 
one-act plays on Thursday night at 8pm in 
the Studio Theatre: The Innocence of Ge
nius by Bobbi Williams, directed by Joe 
Deer, and starring Sila Agavale, Donna 
Leichenko, Emmi Shaw, and Benjamin 
Cain, Jr. and Kiss Me On the Bus, written 
by John Soster, directed by Nina Klefkin, 
and featuring William Smeal and Clover 
Devaney.
The evening began with The Innocence 
of Genius. Its opening was abrupt as the 
house lights went black and then came up 
again to reveal Jolee (Leichenko) kneeling 
in front of a statue of Angel (Agavale). 
During this time, the audience learns that 
Jolee is lamenting her deceased lover, Carl, 
and is contemplating suicide. The statue 
of Angel comes alive and restores Jolees 
will to live through a display of nearly 
mystical affection.
The play dealt with some strong topics 
in a brief 40 minutes. Topics ranged from 
suicide, racism, interracial relationships,
and the coldness of the world. While dealGenius had a very compelling script that 
ing with weighty issues, The Innocence of was brought to life beautifully by a splenGenius avoided becoming preachy. The did cast.
most memorable performance was that of 
Sila Agavale as the Angel, the statue that 
comes to life. His mechanical movements 
were executed in a way that it seemed like

Me On the Bus s, H $av hRE eHEm ?ol,oElHUt
he was being manipulated by the strings 
of puppet master. Agavales voice was as 
calm and mesmerizing as his actions, thus 
captivating the audience. The Innocence of versation with Kelly (Devaney), the lone
Kiss Me On the Bus was the next play 
performed. Unlike The Innocence of Ge
nius, this was not the premiere of Kiss Me 
On the Bus. The plays first showing took 
place on, where else?  a bus! The 
Port Authority Transit and the 
Drama Department sponsored a 
premiere of the play for the news 
media on a PAT bus that left from 
the Skibo parking lot on Wednes
day morning.
Kiss Me On the Bus is a touching 
tale of two unloved, lonely, people, 
brilliantly portrayed by Devaney 
and Smeal, that find their true 
selves, in of all places, a PAT bus.
The set was constructed of actual 
bus seats with a lone woman read
ing the paper. The spotlight was on 
Morgan (Smeal) as he waited at the 
bus stop amid the sounds of the city. Upon 
entering the bus he strikes up (or more 
accurately, attempts to strike up) a conpassenger on the bus, who tries her best to 
avoid him. The conversation covers a vari
ety of topics, ending with Morgan soften
ing Kellys opinion of him as they both 
reveal more to each other and learn even 
more about themselves, while awaiting 
the stop at the hospital.
Both Devaney and Smeal have emo
tional performances as two lonely people 
who share the same empty bus for six 
years without so much as a single word to 
each other. Although this was a very touch
ing story it was not without its funny 
moments, including the scene as Morgan 
steps off the bus, he says to Kelly, I 
probably wont be seeing you much, now 
that Ill be a shoe salesman and all.
Premiere, radical jazz musician to appear
By DAVID BAZELON
Tartan Staffwriter
Alright, I am going to be completely honest with you. 
When I first heard this sample tape of New York com
poser John Zorns music, I thought it was a joke. I was 
ready to call my editors and ask them if they really 
wanted a review of this or if my loyalty to the newspaper 
was being put to the test. What else could I think of these 
noises that would pop in one-by-one, each guaranteeing 
that it would have less to do with the sound following it 
than the one before. It was erratic, it was overbearing, 
and, frankly, it was a little scary. So, there I was, with 
my hand sitting on the telephone, wondering whether I 
should call The Tartan offices or not. Something came 
over me and I decided to not be so hasty in my actions.
After a second listen
ing to the tape, and 
found myself to have a 
different feeling to
wards the work. No, 
the music did not be
come magically en
tangled into a single 
harmonious piece. It 
was still the same odd
ity that came across my 
ears the first time I lis
tened. There was, how
ever, a feeling of excite
ment that came over me 
on this second interval.
The various disembod
ied sounds stirred my
courtesy of Cargo Records 
2sT, /sN, CIee HAAoHN I6eHNVT 0 I, PbIhs LHeeNssnt
emotions and were really starting to become fun to hear. 
First a guitar swings through a quick jazzy riff, then 
something of a metallic clamor would start to ensue, then, 
of all things, the introduction to the television show The 
Munsters would pop up out of nowhere. It was not the 
same as the conventional pieces that most college students 
are used to hearing, but it had a flavor all its own. In fact, 
I would dare say that the avant-garde stylings of Zorn are 
a great deal more powerful than most forms of mainstream 
music and I know they are definitely more risk taking.
The music that I am referring to is John Zorns Cobra 
which will be performed live under Zorns direction along 
with music from The Ex & Tom Cora on Wednesday, 
March 2 in the Skibo Ballroom. The name Cobra is taken 
from a war game and the music is as militant in its own 
right as any trial of war could be. All of the musicians in the 
piece are urged to go off in their own 
separate directions, each jumping in 
quickly and abrasively just as in a game 
of war. When a member of the group 
feels that the time is right, he or she goes 
in for the kill. This tone is brought out as 
disturbingly as the real contexts of a 
war, yet with a great deal of playfulness.
What is most fascinating is that the 
piece should be rather close to a persons 
own understanding of the world, yet it is 
more challenging than any of the more 
mainstream composers works. Cobra 
comes across as a direct product of the 
world we live in. The music is ever chang
ing and always finding new information 
to bestow upon its listeners. It cannot 
find comfort in simply settling back into
one uniform harmony for it knows that there are so 
many more realms of thought out there to explore. This 
type of music ideology is a great deal closer to our own 
world than what other composers produce. The chal
lenge that it presents to the listener is to pay attention 
to the music and try to gain a personal understanding of 
it. Most music will spoon-feed you its themes, Zorns will 
make you think hard in order to extrapolate it.
The Ex & Tom Cora is similar to John Zorn in that they 
both use their music to drive in deep political ideas but 
The Ex does it as a self-dubbed anarchist folk-punk 
band. They are just as diverse in style as John Zorn 
which is proved by the recent advent of Tom Cora to the 
group. Although The Exs sounds are focused around 
gritty guitar riffs and all of the other attributes associ
ated with a punk band, Tom Cora works in his contribu
tion through his master use of a cello.
Furthermore, The Ex regularly seeks to keep Hungar
ian and Turkish folk influences alive in their songs. All 
of this may seem a little mismatched but it only rein
forces their talent when mixing these different themes 
and still making some of the richest music available 
today.
This show will definitely be a moving, thought pro
voking experience. It might demand a little more of its 
listeners than a mainstream concert but it has the 
potential to be infinitely more rewarding.
Exciting Aquaman origin re-told In new series
This week marks the end of 
the limited series, Aquaman: 
Time and Tide. This was another 
one of DCs retellings of the ori
gin of a hero that has been around 
for ages, just like The Man of 
Steel and Batman: Year One. 
Aquaman: Time and Tide had 
one of the premiere writers in 
comics today, Peter David.
I think this is a great idea for 
attracting new readers in a gim
mick-less way with a talented 
creative team, because I prob
ably wouldnt be reading any DC 
books if it wasnt for all the postCrisis on Infinite Earths 
revampings. Many readers, such 
as myself, dont like to jump right 
into a book. These origin issues 
offer a nice starting point for new 
readers and refreshes the memo
ries of old ones, too. Now, if only 
Marvel would catch on and try 
something similar, and Image  
well, it would just be nice if Im
age had origins for all of their 
characters.
Although Aquaman : Time and 
Tide has many similarities to the 
above mentioned works, it is still 
unique. Unlike the rintroduc
tions of Batman and Superman, 
David told his story in a series of 
flashbacks as Aquaman writes 
his memoirs. I think this is a 
more effective way of storytelling 
in comparison to Byrne and 
Miller, since not only do we wit
ness Aquamans past actions, but 
we also get some insight from 
Aquaman who is narrating these 
events. Also, since this limited
bit is overdone, it fits Aquaman a 
lot better than the happy-golucky, frolic with the fishies treat
ment that he has previously re
ceived. Although he is the prod
uct of a human and an Atlantean, 
Aquaman is as hung-up on his 
series is just a springboard for heritage as his foil over at MarComic Book Chronicles

the new Aquaman regular series, 
it will be much better with an

me had to be seeing Aqualad, 
which brought to mind the an
cient Aquaman cartoons from my

pany to give Aquaman and 
Aqualad a pair of sea horses to 
cruise around on.
I highly recommend DCs 
Aquaman: Time and Tide for 
anyone that has a remote inter
est in Aquaman, or is just looking 
for a new book to read. This is 
definitely the best DC (excluding 
DC/Vertigo) book outside of the 
Superman and Batman titles 
since the early issues of Justice
about Davids writing, I dont childhood. Now, if only someone League International. Let me add 
want you to think the art 
should be overlooked. As far 
as I know, this is the first 
work that penciller Kirk 
Jarvinen and inker Brad 
Vancata have done on a ma
jor book. Although this art 
team is new, the work does 
not seem inexperienced.
Jarvinens work is what I 
think Ron Lim of Silver 
Surfer and X-Men 2099 
would be like if he were a 
Manga artist. Vancata ink
ing is an excellent contrast to 
this. Its nice to see a new art 
team developing their own 
style, rather than just copy
ing a current hot artist. I 
hope DC keeps them around 
to work on the regular series, 
too.
Another good point about 
this book is that David gives 
Aquaman more of a person
ality than Ive seen in the 
Aquaman books of the not too 
distant past. Although the

in comics since he is

would be impossible since if it 
wasnt for the King, comic books 
would be very different today, if 
they were even still around. Just 
a few of the characters Kirby cre

The Mighty Thor, and The New 
Gods. Kirby was still active in 
comics up until his death, with 
the two issue limited seriesP/mrctom Force for Image Comics and 
The Secret City Saga for Topps 
comics. His distinct art and writ
ing styles are a major influence 
among comic creators today.
Many creators pay homage to 
Kirby in the credits oftheir books. 
Rob Liefeld even created a char
acter, Jackson Kirby, to show his 
appreciation for the Kings con
tributions to comics. The comic 
book world will surely suffer with 
the loss of the King. Thankfully, 
we have the whole legacy of 
Kirbys work to look back on and

The Adjuster
A disturbing film dealing with sex, perversity, 
and insurance claims, this film was directed by 
Atom Egoyan. Starring Elias Koteas, Arsinee 
Kahnjian, and Gabrielle Rose, the movie por
trays the stark and hedonistic lives of a claims 
adjuster, a woman who reviews pornography, 
and a rich couple out to spend incredible sums of 
money in order to fulfill their basest pleasures.
The film is shot in a way that brings to mind 
mass-produced, commercial images pasted to
gether in order to discover a final great and 
terminating irony.
Like David Cronenberg, Egoyan mixes sex 
with fear and fantasy to create a cavernous and 
frightening thriller.

To some, Annie Hall is Woody Allens best 
film. Starring Allen and Diane Keaton, this film 
portrays the trials and tribulations of love in 
New York. The film won Oscars for Best Picture, 
Actress, Direction, and Screenplay. There are 
also cameos and feature appearances by the 
likes of Paul Simon, Shelly Duvall, Christopher 
Walken, and Jeff Goldblum.
Filled with warmth, wit and neuroses, its no 
wonder that this film is the finest creation of one 
of the best directors around. Amust see film that 
is one of Allens finest efforts.

by Ridley Scott. Powerful and gripping, the story 
revolves around Blade Runner Rick Deckard 
(Ford) and five androids who escape to Earth in

The powerfiil score and stunning visuals make 
this film a fascinating study in dark science

The Masque of the 
Red Death
Vincent Price plays Prospero, a Satan wor
shiping prince in plauge-ridden 12th-century 
Italy. His role consists of torturing and manipu

The film contains an adaption of Edgar Allan 
Poes Hop Frog, the story of a dwarf who be
comes court jester and exacts a horrible revenge. 
Nicholas Roeg, director of The Man Who Fell to 
Earth, was the films director of photography. 
The whole thing was filmed and in the can in five 
weeks, the longest time spent on a Roeg produc
