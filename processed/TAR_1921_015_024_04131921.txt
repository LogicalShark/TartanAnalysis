The Home Concert this year will 
he better than ever before. The season 
.has brought to light many men of 
-ability. This Friday all will be at 
their best. The numbers will give 
-every man a chance to show his tal
ent >in the best way possible. The 
selections are varied so that every 
moment is one of suspense from start 
to finish. There is an abundance of 
specialties with surprises at almost, 
every turn. You will have to watch 
the performance like a three-ring cir
cus to catch dt all.
The performance starts off with 
thatold song, Amici, but with varia
tions. It is followed with a real dis
play of ability in Nicomedes March 
by the Mandolin Club.
The solo voice this year is excep
tional. Then follows a number by 
~the Saxaphone Quartette. They are 
ready for the many numbers which 
will be called for but will close to give 
the Glee Club a chance to give that 
most beautiful Southern lullaby, De 
Sandman. The Mandolin Club will 
close the first half with a short selec
tion.
After an intermission of a few 
moments the Glee Club will start off 
the second part with that selection of 
pep and variations, the Mulligan 
Musketeers. / You will know Mulligan 
after this number. Does the Musical 
Clubs have an orchestra? You bet, 
and its a fine one with all the latest 
jazz ready' for you. The rest of the 
programme is one feature after an
other, closing with one of the most 
apporpriate numbers possible by the 
quartette.
Never before has a porgramme of 
such ability and originality been 
worked out by the Musical Clubs. 
After the concert every one is going 
over to the Schenley and enjoy them
selves at the most representative for
mal of the year. There will be a large 
orchestra and they will play from 10 
until 2 oclock.
Tickets may be procured from any 
member of the clubs and exchanged 
or bought direct in the Central buildContinued on Page Four)
S. A. B. HOLDS MEETING
At the last meeting of the S. A. B. 
"Wednesday night, April (5, an investi
gation of the possibilities of securing 
a. graduate manager of activities was 
suggested. The need of such a man
ager has been pointed out to the board 
on several occasions by representa
tives of the musical clubs, band and 
other non-athletic branches of activ
ity. These organizations feel that 
they could function to greater ad
vantage and with less expense and 
-duplication of effort if they were put 
under the supervision of a graduate 
manager. Just as the graduate man
ager of athletics has made it possible 
for the athletic teams to maintain a 
full schedule with big teams, so, as 
the organizations affected see it, a 
graduate manager of activities would 
be able to benefit their work. He 
would devote his entire time to secur
ing bookings for the various clubs 
and to the work of keeping the camipus informed of their activities and 
keeping them before the public gen
erally. All' these possibilities were 
presented to the board and an in
vestigation has been ordered which 
will ascertain the chances of securing 
such a manager.
The report of the purchasing of a 
30-inch filing cabinet was accepted.
Publication of the Student Hand 
Book for 1921-1922 was discussed and 
the work of editing and supervising 
the publication was delegated to Al
pha Alpha Nu.
Finances and financial conditions 
then claimed the attention of the 
board. The financial reports of the 
Tartan for January, February and 
March, band for March and the 
Technical Journal for February and 
March were presented and accepted. 
An appoprriation of ?25 was made 
for the purpose of sending a repre
sentative to the convention to be 
held at M. I. T. on April 15 and 16. 
The last matter taken up by the 
board Avas the financial report of the 
C. I. T. Journal. An order for $100 
was made for the Journal, which com
pleted the work of the meeting.
On Friday morning the Sophomore 
Electricals held a short meeting and 
elected a new section leader, H. O. 
Sprinkle, to succeed W. C. Carl.
SONG COMPETITION EXTENDED
The competition for songs for the 
Tech Song Book will be extended until 
Saturday, April 16. All those wishing

A joint meeting of these committees 
together with tlie student 'committee 
on Campus Week will be held Wed
nesday, April 13, in the Alumni Olfice 
at 7:30 p. m. These committees ex
pect the support of the entire alumni 
body in making the 1921 Campus 
Week the best alumni-student affair 
ever h61d at Tech.
The Varsity debating team is work
ing daily to put on the final finishing 
touches for its coming debate with 
the University of West Virginia. All 
phases of the question have been 
studied and nothing has been left 
untouched which would give all the 
information possible on the subject. 
Professor Peterson, who is coaching 
the team, is quite confident that W. 
V. U. and W! & J. will have to put 
forth their best, efforts if they wish 
to get a decision. Each and every 
man on the team has had previous 
experience in debating, some inter
collegiate, and are well qualified to 
represent the school In this activity. 
This being our first intercollegiate de
bate members of the team, by the 
spirit they have shown, and members 
of the faculty, through their co
operation, have spared 'no effort tij 
make a good showing in their first 
contest. The interest of the adminis
tration is keen, in the hopes of estab
lishing debating as a permanent activ
ity at Tech and a more extensive 
schedule is looked forward to next 
year. Debating should receive the 
support of the entire student body 
for. few are aware of the amount of 
time and work necessarily involved 
in the preparation for the contest and 
our present team has sacrificed a 
great deal to attain a high state of 
perfection in the interests of Tech.
The debate as announced before will 
be held this Friday evening, April 15, 
in the Arts Theater at 8:15. The af
firmative team, composed of C. Lurie, 
K. Lawrence and L. Whitehead, will 
meet the negative team of W. V. U. 
at Tech, while the negative team, 
composed of'J. McRae, W. Reilly and 
J. Goundry, will journey to Washing
ton to meet the affirmative team of 
W. & J.
Besides the debate there will be a 
vocal number on the program between 
the presentation speeches and re
buttal. Admission is free and there 
is therefore no reason why the con
test should not be well supported-' 
This is the only debate scheduled for 
this year and students as well as 
faculty have an opportunity to show 
their appreciation for the work the 
men have been doing in the'last two 
months.

centage will be liberal enough to enablo the contracting party to realize a 
good profit on the undertaking. Any 
one who is interested should see A. A. 
Mankel, who 'is in charge of con
cessions, at once.
The interfraternity race, which 
proved such a sensation last year,

PLEBES LEARN OF 
POVERTY DAY PLANS
Director Mott AnnouncesChang' 
es at Science Assembly
MUSICAL CLUBS TRY NEW STUNTS
Two successful concerts were 
given by the Musical Clubs in the past 
month, both of which were arranged 
through the efforts of former Tech 
men. The concert given at Sewickley 
was secured through the efforts of 
George Ellerton, a former Mandolin 
Club artist, and the one at Charleroi 
was arranged by the Monongahela 
Clan, a live organization which is in
terested in Tech and Tech music.
At both of these concerts several 
new specialties were tried out prior 
to their use in the home concert. At 
Sewickley, Le Blanc and Agnew put 
on a stunt that will make them 
famous. This black face act is 
clever and original and has a lot of 
local material in it. In fact the act is 
so good that Bert Williams has made 
an offer for itthat Le Blanc and 
Agnew either go with him or discon
tinue the act. However, this offer 
does not Interfere with using the num
ber on April 15, the night of the Home 
Concert. Both will be there and you 
will laugh just as hard as all 'Sewick
ley did. The Saxaphone Quartet has 
also been working during the season 
and will be at the Home Concert with 
some clever numbers. They have 
appeared in concert several times and 
have made a hit every time,
SENIORS PUBLISH JAZZ GAZETTE
A new publication, known as the 
Senior Jazz Gazette, made its ap
pearance this past week among th 
members of the Seniors of the three 
mens schools. The sheet is pub
lished by the Senior Ball Committee 
and is for the purpose of arousing 
interest and spreading information 
concerning the event which they have 
in charge.
The date has been set for May 31st 
and the other details are rapidly 
shaping into form.
Any members of the upper class 
wishing more information and who 
have any suggestions can make them 
known to the committee, which con
sists of Louis Pitts, C. T. McLean and 
A. F. Leef of the Science Division; 
John* Todd from Arts and W. H. Oak
ley and W. D. Hall from Industries.
All the facts about Poverty Day 
and the rules governing participation 
in it were announced at assembly last 
week,v and everybody was urged to 
push the movement and make it a 
greater success than last years. Since 
Science school Introduced this event 
they will be expected to take the lead 
this year with the extension of the 
celebration to Includo all four schools. 
The Plebes were enlightened on the 
matter of getting out of regulations 
on Poverty Day." This reward for 
the best make-ups has resulted in a 
great deal of competition among the 
Plebes and) a lot of knock-out cos
tumes are being planned.
In a speech by Director Mott, which 
took up the greater part of the as
sembly period, a number of changes 
hi tlio school wore announced. Ac
cording to Director Mott the funds 
granted by tlio 'Carnegie Foundation 
for the support of the school havo 
been found to be 'Insufficient and in 
order to make up the deficit it will 
be necessary to Increase the tuition. 
Laboratory fees will also bo raised 
In order to make the laboratories solfsupportlng. Beginning next Septem
ber, the school year will be divided 
Into two semesters Instead of three 
quarters as at present. Director Mott 
praised tlio low mortality In Scienceduring the winter quarter and asked
full co-operation of all the students 
during the spring quarter in keeping 
up the good record. He closed his 
remarks by suggesting a Big 
Brother' movement for next years 
Plebes.
A request was made for suggestions 
for a new and better student govern
ment. The present system has been 
found Inadequate in many respects 
and It Is hoped that suggestions may 
bo forthcoming whloli will remedy 
these defects.

Happenings on the Campus
Announcement has just been made 
of the marriage of Martha Jane 
Willenim to George H. Jarvis at Mount 
Vernon, Ohio. Miss Willenim "was in 
school last year and the announce
ment has heen quite a surprise to her 
many friends here. Mr. and Mrs. 
Jarvis are living In Columbus, O.
M. M. D. HOME CONCERT
There is probably no activity 011 the Campus for which the new 
student can volunteer that offers less of an inducement in the matter 
of recognition and hero worship by his fellow students than the 
Tartan. Members of the Tartan staff do not go on trips where they 
can show the surrounding country what they can do, and at the same 
time have an enjoyable outing. Neither do they have an opportu
nity to get up before an enthusiastic audience and demonstrate their 
ability to beat any particular rival. Not very many of the general 
run of students will pause to remark that there goes Jones, hes on 
tho staff of the college paper, as they pass you on the street.
Why, then, is it worth while to come out for a position on the 
Tartan, or in fact, on any college paper? We think that -vVe know 
the reason, and as we are calling for men and women to work on 
next years staff to come out during the next three weeks, it may be 
well to try to explain our views here and now.
It is worth while because you will like the work. Even as a 
cub reporter, you cannot fail to come into closer touch with your 
fellow students and the faculty of your division in getting the news. 
In the more responsible positions, the work brings you an inside 
knowledge of school affairs. It brings an acquaintance with all the 
men who amount to anything in activities such as no other position 
could give you. It gives you an opportunity to study what your 
contemporaries are thinking about, and what they enjoy.
There may not be any great amount of glory connected with the 
work, but the personal satisfaction of knowing that you are doing 
your best to promote the welfare of your school, together with the 
knowledge that you are on the inside of your college life fully 
compensates for the bouquets which are not thrown at you.
NAMINGTHE DORMITORIES
The annual Girls Home Concert is

MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
Mr. 'Saylor of the Mechanical En
gineering Department has been
studying the employment ; situation

present industrial depression several 
very desirable positions have been 
secured and the indications are that 
there "will be plenty of vacancies for 
this years graduates in mechanical 
engineering.
TEKNON CLUB
Last Thursday the Teknon Club 
held its first meeting of the spring 
quarter. The attendance at the 
meeting -was very good. A constitution 
for the club was adopted. Miss Twila 
Davis was elected treasurer.
The club is to take charge of the 
prayer meeting of the church a week 
from today. Mr. Biddle and Mr. Bar

which will show the aims and scope 
of the club.
Bill SaysWORLD'S WISEST PROF. NOW AT 
NORTHWESTERN
It is gratifying to learn that tho suggestion made in a Tartan 
editorial early this year, concerning the naming of the dormitories 
for some men whose memories would prove an incentive to better 
things on tho pari, of thoso who livo in the Dorms, has borne fruit. 
Those who had the matter to decide may not have been influenced in 
the least by what we had to say, but we arc going to pride ourselves 
in having something to do with the result, anyway.

DORMITORIES WILL HEAR
NAMES OF WAR DEAD
In recognition of the part played by 
the students, graduates and faculty in 
the late struggle the Mens Dormitor
ies are to be named for seven Tech 
men killed during the World War. 
This project, which has been under 
consideration' for some time, was de
cided upon at the last meeting of the 
trustees. The dormitories are at 
present designated merely by num
bersas dormitories 1, 2, 3', etc. Their 
names, when rechristened, will peretuate those of Arthur H. McGill, 
Lewis H. Boss, Henry J. Scobell, Wil
liam F. Welch, Herbert F. Englebreclit, Harry W. Miller and Raymond 
W. Henderson.
No definite arrangements have yet 
been made for the ceremony, nor has 
the exact date been fixed, but it is 
expected to be in the near future. 
There were between 5,000 and 5,500 
students, graduates and faculty mem
bers of tho institute in active mili
tary service during tho war, and the 
entire plan was at the disposal of the 
goyornmont, and tho institute at 
present possesses no tangible form of 
recognition of Its war activities.

"THE POEM OF DAVID
PROVES IMPRESSIVE
A re-visitation or the performance 
of The Poem of David, the one-act 
play which the S'chool of Drama has 
offered at recent matinees confirms 
the first impression that in it Mr. 
Arthur Lubin does the best piece of 
character acting of the year. Within 
the strict limits of this brief form he 
craetes from the lines of .the authors a 
character of considerable intricacy, 
with power upon the memory and the 
emotions. In.a play, designed to il
lustrate the impact of circumstances 
upon a blind1 old Jewish poet, the acting 
of the chief role brings out dexter
ously his pride, sense' of honor, inv
agination and unrelenting racial 
austerity as well as the petulance, and 
the feebleness of old age. Mr. Lubins 
excellently imagined gestures have re
markable variety despite his deten
tion in an arm chair throughout the 
piece. His impersonation is skilled in 
appearance, in dialect and intonation.
The ensemble acting is worthy of 
mention. Miss McAuley is the patient, 
faithful elder daughter; Mr. Hertz is 
the serious and intense young son. 
Miss Morrison, though the least He
braic, Is valuable In her. scenes of re
pressed weeping. The needed contrAst 
in mood and temper is made by Mr 
Paquins woll-dlalected and breezily 
prosperous Irishman.
This impressive little play, the work 
of Kenneth Sawyer Goodman and Ben 
Hochl, Is a happy addition to the list 
of .American onc-acters. Tho Tech pub
lic Is fortunate in having this sympa
thetic production of it by Professor 
Stevens.
"College examinations are barbar
ous and ridiculous survivals of the 
dark ages, asserts Prof. Bernstorff 
of Northwestern University. A stu
dent's final grade, he averred, 
should be based upon his daily work

have outlived their usefulness, why 
dont students get together and sign

EMPIRE STATE CLUB
ABUSE OF TITLES
(From the Indianapolis News).
Perhaps the University of Virginia 
is somewhat extreme in deciding that 
all members of the faculty shall 
hereafter be known as Mister, unless, 
they are regular physicians, but there 
is room for reform in the use of pro
fessional titles. The same need for 
reform will be found in other higher 
educational institutions and among 
the people generally. There is some 
warrant for the use of the title doc
tor^ in connection with a doctor of 
laws or divinity, but the general un
derstanding of the word is that a 
physician or surgeon is meant. There 
has sprung up in this country a loose 
habit of calling any clergyman doc
tor as a mark of respect, but there 
are authorities who contend that a 
term indicating the ministry is more 
fitting. Doctor also has been ap
propriated b3r leaders of cults having 
no connection with medicine. Pro
fessor has been appropriated by band 
directors, school teachers, school ex
ecutives, magicians, fortune tellers 
and others, so there need be little 
surprise that educators called pro
fessors have decided to drop the 
designation. While this reform is in 
progress perhaps some one will find 
out. why an auctioneer is called 
"colonel.

rest of the fellows and girls from New

Johnson is assisted by the other offi
cers elected last week. They are as 
follows: Vice president, J. T. Considine; treasurer, F. Balthaser, and 
secretary, I-I. P. Beyer.

Good Word for tho Parrot.
Testy people consider the parrot a 
nuisance and the loquacious bird has 
often engendered legal strife, bmt to 
the facetious person he Is an endless 
source of amusement. He has an in
herent weakness for profanity, which 
Is apt to be embarrasing, but a ma& 
who has not tasted spirituous liquor^ 
never craves them, and a parrot who 
has not heard profanity will not lonK 
for It as the best medium of expressing 
his sentiments. In this respect he pro
motes culture and refinement in the 
home.

The Plaid nine got down to practice 
again Monday after their trip through 
Virginia last week, and are preparing 
for two hard games this week with 
Duquesne. and Delaware. The southern 
trip was a successful one, the team 
annexing two. of the three games 
played and getting a lot of valuable 
practice which will help them con
siderably in future contests. Coach 
Wagner will spend his time this week 
in bolstering up the weak spots that 
showed up on the trip. Except for the 
first game the Skibos showed they 
had acquired their batting eyes and 
will be hard on the pitchers they are 
to meet.
Duquesne comes to Tech field next 
Saturday with an excellent nine and 
will make Tech men extend themsel
ves to win. They are coached again 
this year by Dan Keefe, who has the 
reputation of being able to put out 
mighty good teams. The Dukes boast 
of several players with high reputa
tions in this section. Their regular 
infield is made up of Klinzig at first, 
Kilday at second, Keefe short and 
ONeil third. McKnight, Tenney and 
Erlaln will be in the outfield and are 
all hard hitters. Coach Keefe has de
cided who he will pitch Thursday but 
has three veterans from last year to 
choose from in Vebelunas, Mareshi 
and McGrath.
1 TENNIS j
Tennlsr with the advent of outdoor 
practice, is beginning to take on a 
rosy hue. Heretofore the team was 
handicapped by indoor practice be
cause it is practically impossible to 
gain a correct idea of just how good 
a man is until that man is given a 
chance to play the game. Indoors the 
men are taught merely to perfect 
strokes, and while they may show 
good strokes and accurate driving 
qualities, such does not always imply 
that he is a winner.
Captain Harkness is showing that 
he will make a good leader. His game 
is well balanced, with just enough 
drive to make him always dangerous. 
His serve is good, and the same 
might be said of his change of pace.
Copley is playing his usual at times 
spectacular, and at other times not so 
good. He is erratic, but with the 
training of actual playin'g, he should 
develop into a mighty formidable man. 
His serve is fast, fact is, it is the 
fastest serve shown at Tech this 
year. His only weakness in that line 
is his tendency to foot-fault, and a 
too great easing-up on the second 
serve.
In Schmertz, Tech has a player who 
will very likely show an immense im
provement. 1-Ie is left-handed, and for 
that reason should put across many 
victories. His style of play is dis
tinctively his own. His returns are 
hard to play. His playing at the net, 
when once he gains the net, is good.
In Keil the tennis team is enriched 
by gaining a man who it Is believed 
can rise to almost any heights neces
sary to put across a victory. While 
his driving qualities are not as good as 
might be hoped for, his game at the 
net, and from the back court, is un
deniably good. He has a chop stroke 
that cannot be beaten.
Neville plays the hardest driving 
game of any man on the courts so far 
this year. His forehand lawford Is 
extremely hard, and his backhand is 
just about as hard. He follows up his 
strokes well, and in all is very dan
gerous.
Rog Marshall is playing his usual 
good and consistent game that bodes 
ill for any one who meets him. He 
will make a good doubles partner for 
any man on the team, because of his 
consistency. He is always depend
able, and his spirit and attitude on 
the courts Is splendid Indeed. He is 
always encouraging to his partnfer in 
doubles, and at the same time a very 
great cause of discouragement to his 
opponents.
The schedule is still -in the makings. 
A number of prospective trips are. 
contemplated, which wijll give the 
Carnegie Tech team a good chance to 
reap fame. Many strong teams will be 
brought ,to the Margaret Morrison 
courts. During Campus Week Beth
any College and Wash-Jeff will meet 
defeat. Another victory" for Tech 
Is planned alsojust who will be the 
victim will be announced later.
The new courts are rounding in 
good shape. No school in the country 
will have Tech beat when it comes to 
courts. The management of these 
courts has been turned over to the 
Student Council, who will appoint a 
supervisor with complete control. This 
supervisor, together with a commit
tee, will draw up a set of rules and 
will print them hi the Tartan next 
week.
j TRACK ]BASEBALL SCHEDULE
The attention of the track squad is 
being spent now in pepraring for the 
Penn Relays on April 30 at Philadel
phia. The team will be picked from 
Hiller, Brumbaugh, Kelly, Lockwood, 
Donahue, Schwab. Obenow, Dykemau 
and Leet. The first three men named 
seem to have the best chance and a 
lively fight for the fourth man will bo 
made. Time trials were held on Sat
urday and Coach Iddings has a bet
ter line on the men out for the 
events. Coach Iddings is considering 
sending a team to Philadelphia to run 
in the Medley Relay Race also. This 
will consist of two men running 220 
each, 6ne running 410 and one run
ning 8S0. Tollman and Kelly will 
likely run the 220, Hiller or Brum
baugh the 440 and Cooper, Leet or
Miller the one-lialf mile.
At present there are about 50 men 
out for the track team and more are 
reporting each day. Most of these are 
preparing for the non-varsity InterClass meet on April 15. The meet will 
start promptly at 3:30 and classes will 
be excused for the rest of the after
noon. The officials of the meet will
be varsity men, with the exception of 
the starter and timer, who will be ex
perienced officials. The schedule of 
events will be the same as that for 
the Fall Class meet with the excep
tion that there will be no two-mile 
run.
The track events will be run at 
the same time as the field events. The 
entry list for the meet ds large and 
Coach Iddings expects to pick up 
some good men from those who will 
compete. The development of the 
men has been slow, due to the cold 
weather up until the last week, and 
the men will reach their best form 
shortly after the season openp.

'Chameleons Food.
Tho proper diet of chameleons and 
lizards consists of files and other In
flects; also meal worms, and tho com
mon idea that sugar and water will 
servo in winter is incorrect. A good 
many of theso animals refuse food In 
tho winter months and all of them 
need warmth and sunshine, as well as 
water. They aro difllcult to keep in 
health, and If not given their natural 
1 food will starve to death In time, 
| though their ability to fast for long 
I periods is well known.
