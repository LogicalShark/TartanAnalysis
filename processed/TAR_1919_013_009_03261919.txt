ill JHill has said, if you want to know 
whether you are destined to be a suc
cess or not, you can easily find out. 
The test is simple and is infallible. 
Are-you able to'save money? If not, 
drop out. You will lose. You may 
think not, but you will lose as sure 
as fate, for the seed of success is not 
in you. Mr. Woods has studied.and 
written much on this subject and a 
pamphlet he prepared on American 
ExtravaganceA National Problem, 
is an authoritative and comprehensive 
treatise of the matter, 
ill! After brief introductory remarks, | 
Mr. Woods launched into the heart of 
the themeby saying that the 
strength of wealth must not be meas
ured exclusively by an army and 
navy. Back of these lies the moral, 
physical and financial strength of the 
ft people. Effeminate, extravagant, pro
digal nations, even if civilized, large 
and rich, have ever been the prey ofi
~strong, sturdy, frugal ones. Thus was 
wealthy, luxurious Romethe mis
tress of the worlda prey to barbar
ian Goths and Vandals. The real 
strength of any nation lies in the 
character of its people; and wasteful
ness, Extravagance and prodigality 
undermine the entire mental, physi
cal, financial and moral fibre of the 
nation.
Do these characteristics tend to 
make America such a 'nation as those 
New England farmers, who resisted 
strong and wealthy Great Britain 
nearly a century and a half ago? Is 
it not the-frugality of sturdy Switzer
land that enables her to keep out of 
the maelstrom of war that envelops 
her on all sides? Would France have 
been able to.hold her lines at Verdun 
had her people instead of being thrifty 
and provident, practiced the luxury 
and extravagance of the United 
States? Wealth quickly won is dan

Fresh ended by having their hair 
taken down, and a string of hairpins 
now adorns the Soph. trophy table.
Revenge must have reddened the 
green heart of the Freshmen for the 
following day, at noon, they gave a 
most pepy exhibition on the field, 
wearing bows of class colors, and 
carrying banners (fakes, for the real 
ones disappeared, say the Sophs). 
They there sang and cheered and 
marched beautifully to the apprecia
tion of an audience, composed of all 
but Sophs. Yes, the Sophs either ut
terly ignored them, or thought discre
tion the better part of valor. But it 
must have been a thorn in the afore
said verdant heart, to come out ready 
for a fight, and then not get it after 
all. Sophs look very wise when asked 
about it, and let you know that they 
played a not'discreet, but ciever role, 
and that the Freshmen have the right 
spirit, which, if not carried too far, 
will make them worthy of their pre
decessors.

PROF. PF0TS TALKS TO C. M, E. S.
On Wednesday evening, March 19, 
the Carnegie Mechanical 'Engineers 
Society held it's third meeting of the 
present school year.
The society following its custom of 
having a talk on some subject which 
will broaden the outlook of the en
gineers secured Mr. Pfouts, whose 
Subject was The Natural Resources 
of a Country.
Mr. Pfouts began with the early 
history of our country and the re
sources which then existed. He con
trasted these with the resources ex
isting in European countries. In Rus-i 
sia especially he pointed out the

TRIM SOPHOMORES
The M. M. C. C. Freshmen girls were 
delightful hostesses, and the Sopho
mores worthy guests when they gath
ered at the Union, Friday, Feburary 
14. The hall had been made beauti
ful by palms, banners, lamps and the 
moon, and to this was added the 
charm of the girls in pretty evening 
or afternoon dresses. Excellent music 
was furnished by McNemerys or
chestra, the programs being in ma
roon and gold, the Freshmen colors. 
Refreshing punch was served to the 
dancers between the dances.
Owing to the absence of Mrs. Con
rad, the Freshman honorary advisor, 
and Miss Harrison, the Sophomore
as she is one the most busy women in 
this city. The Y. W. C. A. surely felt 
honored in being able to secure Mrs. 
McFeddres, even for one day.
Margaret Matfern was the leader of 
this most interesting meeting.
At the next meeting on March 27, 
scrap books will be made for the 
Childrens Hospital of this city. This 
promises to be a very informal and 
unusual sort of meeting, and it is 
hoped a large number of girls will 
come out and, while having a good 
time themselves, will be helping to 
brighten the life of some little kiddie 
of the Pittsburgh hospitals.

Before dismissing the upper class

the matter of physical training. The 
plan is to devote 20 minutes a day to 
some sort of exercise. Probably five 
minutes of the time will be taken up 
by calisthenics and the remainder In 
some sort of games.
As this P. T. would be taken In

that it might contain some disagree

time during the day every one can 
take ten minutes in which to slip

shower.
Credit in such will be a requisite to 
graduation, and no classes are ex
cused. Dr. Esquerre does not think 
that Seniors all contract a sudden 
dose of good health.

Cleanup day Is to bo a reality at 
Tech. A day set aside for beautify
ing the campus Is nothing new. 
With recent yoars this has become 
a well established custom in many 
of the great universities and col
leges of the country.
Last Friday thirty-seven Freshmen 
worked for about ono hour, cleaning 
up the athletic Held. The change they 
brought about was remarkable. The 
peculiar part about It. was that the 
plebes all on joyed the work. They 
were having a better time than they 
had for some time. At the same 
time they wore accomplishing some
thing for Tech.
Lets beautify the campus has 
been a byword for some time. The 
administration is going to do its 
part. The student body will be 
asked by the student council to give 
a little aid to this project. Only one

teresting ideas about how this clean
up should be effected, and the sug
gestion, which seems to have partly 
originated with Miss Parry, of plant
ing trees on the campus in memory of 
Techs own boys who have died so 
nobly in France, must meet with gen
eral approval.
Then came the song contest. Digni
fied upper-classmen and heartless 
Sophomores alike must admit that 
here the Freshmen shone supreme. 
For this occasion each of the four 
classes had composed a song that was 
clever and full of spiritbut the prize 
(whether it will ever be more than a 
spiritual one or not) goes t;o the 
Freshmen, who must have a lot of 
pep to be able to write such a song, 
when t.hev are so mistreated.
Professor T. Bayard Beatty will give 
an address on the subject of Art and 
Christianity. All interested will be 
heartily welcome.
B. C. C. CLUB DANCE A BIG SUCCESS
The much talked of B. C. C. Club 
dance is past. It was a success from 
every viewpoint and will be remem

The music was about as peppy as 
anything heard in the Union this 
season and the Design School sure

music for their Oriental Ball.

Everywhere on the campus we see

the book can not be a success, if, each 
of us does not take the hint and Be

The Thistle board needs the sup

On May 31 the biggest Inter-Scho

had will be held on Schenley oval. 
The after-tlje-war revival spirit has 
hit the high and prep schools just as 
it hit the colleges, and these schools 
are jumping at the chance to come to 
Tech for the meet. All larger high 
schools and prep schools from Penn

York and West Virginia will compete. 
A silver loving cup will be awarded 
to the school winning the most points. 
Gold, silver and bronze medals, bearing a plaid enameled C will bo

event.
To close the day and help make it 
a memorable one, a big, jazzy smoker 
will be held In the Union that night.
It will be for the schools who have 
competed in the meet. Plans are al
ready being made for the smoker and

FORBES HALL HAD 
.HILLY (MIRATION
Forbes Hall was the scone of jolly 
celebration of ,st. Patricks Day, 
Saturday night. The beautiful and 
appropriate green and white color 
scheme was carried out by green wall 
and light decorations, also green pro
grams In the shape of shamrocks, ajid 
the girls in white dresses.
At. 8 o'clock Schmortz's Orchostra 
arrived and, after hearing the first 
strains of t'holr music, It was Im
possible not to dance. The fourth 
dance was a feature dance. Each 
man drew from a jar a shamrock on 
which was written the name of the 
girl who was to bo Ills partner for 
that dance. This was much more suc
cessful than the usual Paul .Tones. 
At 11 o'clock thoro was an Intermis
sion and a delicious Ico, cakes and 
mints sorved by the commltteo. Danc
ing then continued until 12 oclock, 
when all were reluctant to cease.
Dr. Kalo Gordan, the successor of 
Miss Ilowitt, as chaperon of Forbes 
Hall, came Saturday and attended the 
dance. The groat success of tho 
dance may bo attributed to the origi

ST. PATRICKS DAY AT M. M.
For the first time in the memory of 
any M. M. member the lunch room 
was decorated to celebrate the birth
day 'of the Irish patron saint, St. Pat
rick.
The lunch counter was decorated 
with green streamers and flags; the 
napkins, instead of being the usual 
uninteresting affairs, were dainty af
fairs with harps and green flags in 
the corners.
It was a very thoughtful thing for 
those In charge of the lunch room 
lo do, and the girls and faculty all 
appreciate the change from the every

Dear Allsworth: 
I was glad to hear that The Tartan 
had been started again. It seems as 
though that were a long step towards 
getting back to normal times again 
old activities and old men back. Say, 
the place must seem like home again. 
I wish you and the - staff the best of 
success. I know it is uphill work, but 
feel confident that you will make a 
go of it.
I should like to have you put me on 
the mailing list, and if you have back 
numbers I would be interested in 
them, also.
Yours, with best wishes for The

TECHMECHANICS CLUB /
HAS NOW REORGANIZED
Few 1liiii|i.s lend more to the (harm and beauty ot a college 
than does a neat and well eared for campus. It gives relief to 'the 
undergraduate from the grinding monotony ol! his scholastic work. 
To I lie graduate, the recollection ol: the hours ol! his life on the cam
pus, will he the brightest of I he lingering memories of his college 
days.
Cornell is famous for the splendor of its campus, as is Harvard 
for its stately elms. No one thing adds.more to the appearance of 
a campus than do trees. They break the irksome sameness of the 
buildings and set them apart in a pleasing, artistic manner.
Tech is quite conspicuous on account ol: its lack of trees. In 
order that this defect might be corrected, and that the campus 
might be brought up to the standard of the school itself, the C. M. 
111. ('. has taken the .matter of planting trees to the Four Schools 
Council. Pr would certainly be a big thing in helping put the 
campus in condition, and establish a custom that, is destined to make 
this one of flic most beautiful school grounds in the country.
THE BAND
The band, as was mentioned before In these columns, is an cssent.ial part of the activities of the school, and worthy of the support of 
every student. Pr is open to every one and this opportunity should 
be used by every student that plays' a band instrument. Pr is not;

PITT AND TECH GIRLS HOLD DIBLE DISCUSSION
Under the snappy leadership of 
Miss Conant from Central Y 25 
girls from Pitt and Tech gathered be
fore the cheerful open fire in the liv
ing room of the Hospitality House on 
Wednesday evening. Discussion this 
month centered on the .Bible and 
scientific truth.
It is a fact tha people often shy at 
discussion of Bible topics, and much 
of this is due, I believe, to unprofes
sional treatment and sentimental at
titudes. Miss Conants discussions 
are modern, positive, based on fact 
and done with two feet on the ground. 
This series of discussions 1 will run 
through the spring with one meeting 
a month on the fourth Wednesday.
At the first meeting, a month ago, 
Tech Avas well represented, but tty is 
time we were far overshadowed by 
Pitt. As Tech has little enough 
spiritual element in its make-up, this 
informal discussion .fills a groove in 
the school program.

Once in a while some one asks: 
Whats the need of another Liberty 
Loan now that the war is over?
Revenue from taxes will not be suf
ficient to pay all the bills, so the 
people will he called upon to provide 
the money by subscribing to govern
ment bonds. This money is .going to 
pay off the army of producers at homo 
the farmers, merchants, manufac
turers and others.
America had just begun to. light 
when the Hun decided it was time to 
quit. Allied leaders expected the war 
to last another year and the United 
States government was turning out 
ships, arms, ammunition and food to 
overwhelm Germany in one big 
drive.
Treasury officials have revealed 
that in 1919 America would have had 
a tank at the front for every seventylive feet of line. We would have had 
ten tons of mustard gas ready for 
shipment for every ton Germany 
could produce. Thousands of batter
ies of guns would have been in act
ion for every one America had in 191S. 
Everything else was being produced 
in proportion.
This gigantic,, preparation brought 
an early end to the war and saved 
thousands of lives. Victory Liberty 
Bonds will pay for this work which 
had been contracted for and was be
ing delivered when the armistice was 
signed.
There are other purposes for which 
money is need. Part of our army of 
2,000,000 men must be kept in Europe 
until the peace treaty is signed. 
These soldiers must be fed. clothed 
and otherwise maintained. Then they 
must be brought home.
The sick and wounded must be car
ed for in hospitals. The army must 
be 'demobilized. There are thousands 
of maimed soldiers, heroes of the 
great war, who must be taught selfsupporting trades and given an oppor
tunity to earn their living.
This reconstruction work at home 
must be carried on. The job must be 
finished.. The American people who 
furnished the money to win the war 
must supply It also to bring the na
tion back to a peace basis.

Then well eat our hat.

As such youll receive em;
Go farther than that
We hope youll believe em.
Who carries the laundry?
Who answers the phone?
And, when the meats served,

These and other weighty questions 
were discussed by the members of 
the Research Bureau for Retail Train
ing when the students received the 
faculty of the Psychology Depart
ment and badethem the top of the 
evenin.  The gym was, happily cho
sen, as it enabled this august group 
to give full play to their naturally 
Childlike tendencies. Such was 
their enthusiasm in aiming for goal, 
that the basket ball crashed against 
windows and mirrors, much to the 
dismay of the Entertainment Commit
tee, who felt a slight sense of re
sponsibility. The stage at the other 
end of the gym was an appropriate 
setting for the Egyptian dance, which 
was put on by some of the members 
of the Faculty, gracefully draped in 
tennis nets and green and orange 
streamers. The piano and smooth 
floor also proved their usefulness, 
and staid members of the Faculty 
merrily fox-trotted ' and one-stepped. 
to the strains of Oh, Frenchy, 
Frenchy, and other classical hits.
The M. M. C. C. lunch room also 
did its bit, as here the green and 
orange salad, yum-yummy nut sand
wiches and coffee ^ere prepared, and 
wheeled in state into the gym.
The climax of the evening was 
the irregular meetings of the staff 
as advertised. The curtain arose and 
the Faculty were amazed to see their 
doubles come strolling in and seat 
;hemselves around the conference ta
ble. The cast was as follows:

FETE FANTASTICTHURSDAY NIGHTI FRATERNITY NOTES I
Thursday evening will be the occa
sion of the Fete Fantastic, the big
gest event, of the entire year for the 
Design Students. The lavish splen
dor of the ball is quite'beyond all 
comprehension, Every department of 
the school is co-operating to mak 
the affair successful. The faculty 
has announced that no examinations 
will be given' to interfere with the 
ball. The plebe, regulations have 
been modified until after the ball.
The entire Fete Fantastic will be 
assembled Monday. Each detail has 
been completed and waits fitting into 
its proper place. It is certain thal 
when the guests arrive Thursday 
night, they will be awe-stricken with 
the marvelous beauty of the back
ground. The foyer of the Design 
School will be splendidly decorated, 
hut the exhibition room will repre
sent the acme of artistry. Great 
Oriental fetishes will tower to the 
celling, while the walls will be pan
eled with gorgeous Chinese dragons 
and deities. A great statue of Budd
ha, made in the Design School, will i 
watch over the scene from a platform 
at one end of the room. Tile Iigming will be a marvel of beauty. No 
lights will be visible, but, instead, the 
entire school will be illuminated by 
a soft glow from myriads of con
cealed lights. Johnsons orchestra of 
eight pieces will provide music dur
ing the ball. A program of enter
tainment will be presented by mem
bers of the different departments 
which will consist of exhibition 
dances' as well as many other spec
ialties.
in order-that the students of all 
the schools and those' interested in 
Carnegie Tech may have an oppor
tunity of seeing the decorations of 
the Design School, it ^las been ar
ranged to leave all the decorations 
undisturbed for a week after the 
fete. During this time, all are welcome to inspect the scene of the Fete 
Fantastic.
.-bcudents in every department are 
busy putting the finishing touches on 
the decorations. The panels with 
which the walls of the exhibition 
room will be covered are marvels ol' 
color and design. The entire fete 
has been designed by Mr. Ellington, 
who has spent some time at the 
Ecole de Beaux Arts in Paris. The 
panels have been designed by Mr.
Savage and carried out by the stu
dents. Mr. Southwell devised the
entire color scheme.
The many beautiful posters which 
have been made for the ball will be 
assembled and placed on exhibition 
in the Hewlitt Museum, adjoining the 
Exhibition Room, where they will be 
left for a week after the ball.
Mr; Stark, the president; of the stu
dent body, wishes to express, on be
half of the committee that arranged 
the ball, their deep gratitude to all 
those members ol' the faculty and 
student body who have worked so 
hard to make the event: successful.
The guests will be masked until 
midnight, when a feast will ... 
served In (the Exhibition rtoom. The 
gorgeous decorations, together with 
tin' kaleidoscopic ensemble of Ori
ental costumes, will form a spectacle 
more brilliant than any of the Arab; 
Inn NJphliH and. It. is certain that 
when Allndln rubbod his magic lamp 
ho could not have found himself In 
a more wonderful place than the 
"iinst" at the Fete Fantistlque will 
find themselves.

MENORAH ACTIVITIES
Society is having a 
ill season. The interest 
of the members is whole-hearted and 
enthusiastic, and with that in their 
favor, it is easy for the administration 
to achieve good results.

activities by planning a series of in
formal dances, for the benefit, of the 
members. The first of these was 
held March 22, at the Temple.
The next regular meeting will be 
held on Friday, March 2S, at S:15 p. 
in., at the Rodef iShalom Temple. Mr. 
David Glide, the principal speaker, 
will relate his experiences in France. 
An excellent musical program is as
sured. After the regular business of 
the meeting, refreshments will be 
served, and a social hour enjoyed.
M. M. C. S. and Design girls, come 
out and meet your fellow-students of 
P. C. V7., T. T. S. and Pitt. You are 
certain to discover common interests.
(Continued From Page One.) 
thing is true of nations, for nations 
are but aggregations of men. In a 
comparatively short time, America 
has acquired over $235,000,000,000 of 
wealth, equal almost to the entire 
wealth of the rest of the world. Are 
we an exception to the history of na
tions, ancient or modern, which shows 
that the period of a nations suddenly 
acquired wealth is the beginning of its 
deterioration and decay? Therefore, is 
not our wealth, if not properly used, 
a national menace? Does, it not re
main to be seen whether we shall 
bear it better than did Rome?
"Another menace to our nation is 
the misuse of credit, which, as John 
D. Rockefeller said, Rightly used is 
one of the best business assets, but, 
abused, has caused the downfall of in
dividuals and nations. It seems to 
be our habit that instead of meeting 
expenses from income, as Americans 
could and should, the individual, 
township, city, county, State and 
even Government borrows from the 
future to spend in the present. It is 
appalling to know that we probably 
pay as much for interest in this coun
try as the total savings of Great 
Britain and France. You can spend 
saved money, but you can neither 
spend nor save spent money. It is 
the thrifty and frugal who are the 
backbone of any nation. It is they 
who supply its funds. It is they upon 
whom rests its credit. It is they who 
are never in want in their lives. And 
further, it is they who as a rule are 
the happy ones. It is better to save 
today than to economize tomorrow. 
No business institution can be well 
run without keeping an account of 
expenses. Yet how many Americans 
keep a personal record of how their 
money-is spent during the year? We 
should put ourselves under some 
definite method of saving; by com
pelling ourselves to put aside so much 
every week or every month in a sav
ings bank or a building and loan so
ciety or a life insurance company, or 
some such other institution. In other 
words, we should force ourselves to 
accept some definite financial plan, 
which will mean systematic thrift. We 
shall never regret it and we shall be 
assisting America to fortify herself 
that she may be secure, not only 
against the foreign foe, but against 
the most insidious and the most dan
gerous of all her enemiesherself. 
Only by the exercise and continued 
exercise of qualities that make a peo
ple great can greatness be maintained. 
Money saved, we have. Money spent, 
we lose.

Another masterful production by 
the genius of screencraft, David W. 
Griffith,. will be the feature of the 
program at the  New Million Dollar 
Grand throughout next week, start
ing Monday morning, March 31. It 
is called The Girl Who Stayed at 
Home, and tells the story of the 
battles fought by the young women 
who remained in their accustomed 
surroundings while their sweethearts 
were fighting the Huns in the trench
es. It is a vital, human photoplay, 
teeming with action and intense 
drama. There are strong scenes in 
great number, following one another 
In rapid succession, and there are 
scenes of deep human interest and 
humor, which Griffith is such a won
der In picturing.
